Agarose and collagen separately are common biopolymers used in cartilage mechanobiology and mechanotransduction studies but lack features that make them ideal for functional engineered cartilage . In this study , agarose ( 8 % w / v and 4 % w / v ) is blended with collagen type I ( 4mg / mL ) to create composites . We hypothesized that a higher stiffness , composite hydrogel would promote native cartilage - like conditions . To address these questions , acellular and cell - laden studies were completed to assess rheologic and compressive properties , contraction , and structural homogeneity in addition to matrix mechanics , cell proliferation , and glycosaminoglycan production . Over 21 days in culture , cellular 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen I hydrogels displayed good structural and bulk mechanical properties , cell proliferation , and continual glycosaminoglycan production , indicating promise towards the development of an effective hydrogel for chondrocyte mechanotransduction and mechanobiology studies . INTRODUCTION Cartilage mechanobiology and tissue engineering fields have both evolved using strategies employed to repair or regenerate damaged cartilage using a combination of biomaterials , cells , and stimulation . It is well accepted that applying mechanical forces to engineered cartilage constructs can help mimic the natural environment and stimulate chondrocytes to produce extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components and maintain tissue integrity to enhance the formation of functional cartilage tissue 1 - 3 . However , the underlying mechanisms that are employed during these processes are poorly understood 4 , 5 . Many studies focus primarily on the effects of loading conditions applied to cartilage constructs 6 - 10 . However , another key factor to consider is construct composition , since administered mechanical forces can be influenced by exogenous physical and chemical cues of the 3 - dimensional matrix that envelops the cell 11 . Cartilage - like constructs are often formed of polymeric hydrogels 12 , 13 . Agarose is a common natural polymer used for cartilage mechanobiology studies due to its easily tunable mechanical stiffness . However , prior chondrocyte biology studies use low ( 2 - 3 % v / v ) concentration agarose - based hydrogels 14 - 18 , which do not achieve cartilage - like mechanical properties as their corresponding moduli range from 13 kPa to 18 kPa . Zignego , et . al . , however , found that higher concentration 4 . 5 % w / v agarose hydrogels achieve stiffness levels within ranges found in the native pericellular matrix ( PCM ; 20 - 200 kPa 19 , 20 ) while still maintaining chondrocyte viability , highlighting potential of high stiffness microenvironments to better match cartilage properties for subsequent mechanotransduction studies 21 . However , without modification , agarose lacks integrin binding motifs that are critical in the mediation of cell - ECM interactions . Collagen I is another natural polymer common in chondrocyte studies 22 - 24 . Unlike agarose , collagen offers ample binding motifs 25 , to promote cell adhesion and migration . Collagen hydrogels have a large water content leading to flexibility similar to natural tissue , exhibit biocompatibility and biodegradation abilities , and can be mechanical tuned through physical or chemical cross - linking 12 . While type II collagen is the most abundant extracellular molecule in cartilage , providing foundation for the use of collagen hydrogels , in vitro studies generally use type I collagen hydrogels since they demonstrate superior mechanical qualities . However , type I collagen hydrogels are still soft compared to cartilage and often do not maintain their 3 - dimensional structure for extended studies 22 . For example , 1 - 3 mg / mL concentrations , a typical range found in chondrocyte - embedded collagen hydrogel studies , result in elastic moduli of 5 - 22 pascals 22 , 26 , 27 . Composite hydrogels combine the favorable properties of each individual polymer , enabling tunable mechanical and structural properties and leading to more ECM - like interactions that promote cues for proliferation , differentiation , and matrix production . Few groups have studied the interactions between agarose and collagen biomaterials and their influence on cells 28 - 33 . Cambria , et . al . , assessed the impact of low concentration agarose blended with collagen on nucleus pulposus cells , finding composite hydrogels to outperform agarose - only hydrogels in terms of cell adhesion and proliferation , likely attributable to the binding motifs that exist within the collagen component 28 . Quarta , et . al . , cultured breast cancer cell lines in agarose - collagen hydrogels to assess the mechanical properties and potential cytotoxicity as agarose content was increased , of which at the low concentrations assessed , while there was a change in mechanical behavior , no cytotoxicity was observed 29 . Ulrich , et . al . , used another cancer cell line to assess how an increase in hydrogel stiffness would alter cell motility and therefore the potential influence of agarose on collagen deformation and remodeling 30 . While the group’s work with mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy fail to indicate agarose induces collagen ligand alterations , microscopy images do suggest agarose inhibits cell - directed assembly of large collagen bundles , also influencing cell spreading and motility 30 . While these studies demonstrate applications of agarose - collagen hydrogels and their compositional influence on mechanics , cell viability , and remodeling , study of the response of chondrocytes to this environment are critical to the application of such hydrogels to the study of cartilage mechanobiology . In this study , we aimed to develop an agarose - collagen composite hydrogel that combines the mechanical properties of agarose with the biofunctionality of collagen to mimic native articular cartilage tissue and enable future chondrocyte mechanobiology studies . Comparing against agarose and collagen only hydrogels , we evaluated agarose - collagen composite hydrogel mechanical properties and structural homogeneity alongside their effect on chondrocyte viability , proliferation , and sulfated glycosaminoglycan ( sGAG ) production . MATERIALS & METHODS Experiments conducted in this study were divided into two main categories ( 1 ) acellular and ( 2 ) cell laden . All hydrogel formulations were otherwise prepared in the same fashion . The aim of acellular experiments was to elucidate the innate structure - function relationships between the hydrogel formulation and the resulting bulk mechanics and structural homogeneity . Cell - laden hydrogel experiments were then used to assess chondrocyte morphology , proliferation rates , and sGAG production . Hydrogel Preparation To prepare agarose hydrogels , low - gelling temperature type VII - A agarose ( A0701 , Sigma Aldrich ) was dissolved in 1× phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and autoclaved ( chamber temperature of 120°C and sterilization time set to 15 minutes ) . For cell - based experiments , the solution was cooled to 40°C prior to adding chondrocytes and casting in the mold . Collagen I hydrogels were prepared by chilling and mixing rat tail collagen I ( RatCol® ; 5153 , Advanced BioMatrix ) with its associated neutralizing solution in accordance with the manufacturer protocol to obtain a 4mg / mL solution . Two composite hydrogel formulations were studied . The first composite consisted of 4 % w / v agarose with 2 mg / mL collagen I . The second composite consisted of a 1 : 1 ratio of the aforementioned agarose - only and collagen - only formulations , leading to 2 % w / v agarose with 2 mg / mL collagen I concentration . Composite hydrogels were manually mixed via pipetting while maintained in a ~ 40°C water bath to prevent collagen denaturation and premature agarose gelation . Positive displacement pipette tips were used to aliquot 150 - μL volumes of each hydrogel solution into custom ( 3 - mm tall , 6 - mm inner diameter ) PDMS based molds ( 00 - 30 , Ecoflex ) . Cell Encapsulation To obtain primary chondrocytes , seven C57BL / 6J mice ( 5 days old ) were humanely euthanized under institutional approval ( IACUC protocol 2104002138 ) to isolate neonatal cartilage of the proximal and distal femur and the proximal tibia under sterile conditions . Tissues were digested in 3 mg / mL type II collagenase ( 17101 - 015 , Gibco ) reconstituted in culture media for one hour at 37°C followed by digestion in 0 . 5 mg / mL type II collagenase overnight at 37°C . Tissue was agitated to dissociate residual tissue pieces , and the entire solution was filtered through a 40 - μm cell strainer into a 50 - mL conical tube . Sterile 1× PBS was added until a 40 - mL total volume was reached , at which point the solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes . The supernatant was aspirated , and the cell pellet resuspended in 30 mL of sterile 1× PBS to be re - centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes . The supernatant was again aspirated , and the pellet resuspended in complete growth media and counted . Chondrocytes were resuspended into hydrogels at concentrations of 1 × 10 6 cells / mL prior to full hydrogel gelation . Hydrogels with and without cells were allowed to solidify at room temperature for 10 minutes , followed by the addition of 0 . 5 - mL complete culture media [ phenol - free 4 . 5 g / L glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; 31053 - 036 , Gibco ) supplemented with L - glutamate ( AAJ6057322 , Gibco ) and sodium pyruvate ( 11360 - 070 , Gibco ) ) completed with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; 12676029 , Corning ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( 15140 - 122 , Gibco ) ] . Hydrogels were cultured in a 37°C , 5 % CO 2 incubator in 48 - well plates for up to 21 days . Culture medium was changed every 2 - 3 days . Rheological Characterization of Acellular Hydrogels Following recommendations for rheological characterization of hydrogels 34 , small amplitude oscillatory shear tests were performed ( AR - G2 Rheometer , TA Instruments ) using a 20 - mm diameter parallel plate geometry and hydration chamber to mitigate evaporation . 150 - µL acellular hydrogel solution was dispensed between plates . After shear rheometric parameters were set ( Table 1 ) , the plate was rapidly heated or cooled to begin gelation . Storage ( 𝐺′ ) and loss ( 𝐺 ! ! ) moduli were defined as the average of all values recorded per step . Table 1 . Parameters for shear rheometric testing .

Strain sweeps from 0 . 1 to 100 % strain were used to assess the linear viscoelastic region ( LVR ) limits on fully formed gels . A time sweep was used to confirm consistent mechanical behavior over time and that no unexpected increase in loss or storage modulus would occur due to innate material properties during culture . Each sample ( n = 3 ) was only used for one sweep . Unconfined Compression of Hydrogels The effect of agarose and collagen concentrations on equilibrium moduli were evaluated by uniaxial unconfined compression tests . Bulk mechanical changes were assessed in both acellular ( n = 6 ; after 24 hours gelation ) and cell - laden hydrogels ( n = 4 ; throughout 21 - days of culture ) using the same protocol . First , the diameter and heights per each individual sample were measured with a digital caliper prior to testing on a universal testing machine ( ElectroForce 5500 , TA Instruments ) equipped with a 20 - lbf load cell then maintained in a 1× PBS bath during tests . Stress - relaxation was then performed to 10 % strain and held ( acellular = 1200 seconds ; cell - laden = 600 seconds ) to evaluate the compressive modulus and time - dependent behavior ( 10 % strain , 1 % strain / sec ) . The load vs time data obtained from these tests were converted to stress vs time data by applying sample geometry information . These data were then used to estimate the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels using a nonlinear Prony Series model 35 : 𝜎 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜎 " + 𝜎 # 𝑒 $ % & ! + 𝜎 ’ 𝑒 $ % & " ( 1 ) where 𝜎 ( and 𝜏 ( are stress parameters and relaxation time constants , respectively . From these outputs , the equilibrium modulus ( 𝐸 " = 𝜎 " / 𝜀 ) and instantaneous modulus ( 𝐸 ) = ( 𝜎 " + 𝜎 # + 𝜎 ’ ) / 𝜀 ) could be calculated by normalizing the experienced stresses to the applied strain 36 . The model was fitted to experimental data using a non - linear least squares method in MATLAB ( R2022a , MathWorks ) . Electron Microscopy of Acellular Hydrogels Texture and homogeneity of hydrogels ( n = 3 ) were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE - SEM ; SEM ) . Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , fractured with a frozen razor blade , and stored at - 80 °C . Hydrogels were lyophilized ( VirTis , SP Scientific ) for 48 hours at - 20°C followed by 10 hours at 20°C . Samples were sputter coated with 24 - nm of Au - Pd ( SPI Supplies ) then imaged using a cold field emission high resolution scanning electron microscope ( S - 4800 , Hitachi ) at an operating voltage of 10 - kV . SEM images at 100× magnification were used to quantify porosity using an adapted open - source MATLAB script 37 while 10 , 000× SEM images were used to quantify collagen fiber diameters using an adapted open - source Fiber Diameter Distribution v1 . 0 . 3 script 38 , 39 . In short , to quantify porosities , the image segmentation code segmented images using adaptive thresholding , relying on the mean intensity of a local neighborhood rather than global histogram - based thresholding ( i . e . , Otsu ' s method ) . An iterative refinement process was applied through erosion and dilation to enhance the segmentation of the region . However , due to the distinct variations between the collagen fibers and background in the 10 , 000× images , mean and Gaussian filters were applied . Subsequently , column and row sweeping operations were carried out . Additionally , 2000X SEM images were used for qualitative comparison . Cell Growth As a surrogate to evaluate cell viability and proliferation , a resazurin assay was used at the initial timepoint ( immediately following cell - laden hydrogel gelation ) and intermittently over 21 days of culture . Hydrogels ( n = 3 ) were incubated for 4 hours in a solution of FBS - free DMEM supplemented with 10 % Resazurin dye ( AR002 , R & D Systems ) at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . Fluorescence was quantified using an excitation of 530 / 15 nm and emission of 590 / 15 nm on a fluorescent plate reader ( BioTek Cytation 5 , Agilent Technologies ) . Nuclear Morphology Hydrogels were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight and stored at 4°C in 1× PBS until ready for immunofluorescent imaging . Hydrogel sample preparation and imaging was completed within 1 - week of initial storage . Samples were embedded within a 3 % agarose ( BP160 - 100 , Fisher Bioreagents ) mixture and sectioned in a vibratome ( VT 1200 , Leica ) into 300 - µm thick sections . Before microscopic examination , sections were stained with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; H - 1200 - 10 , Vector Laboratories ) , to detect nuclear morphology and 2 - dimensional spatial positioning using an upright confocal ( Confocal 800 , Zeiss LSM ) . Images ( n = 4 ) were taken of each hydrogel type at random locations within the sample and FIJI were used to analyze morphological properties of the nuclei , including aspect ratios and areas . Extracellular Matrix Production The sGAG content in cell - laden hydrogel constructs was measured to compare ECM remodeling with respect to hydrogel formulations . After 3 , 7 , 14 , or 21 days of culture , hydrogels ( n = 3 ) were weighed , flash frozen , lyophilized overnight , and reweighed . Hydrogels were digested in 1 mL of 50 µg / mL Proteinase K ( P6556 , Sigma Aldrich ) in 50 mM Tris , 1 mM CaCl 2 , pH = 8 for 16 hours at 56°C followed by 30 minutes at 90°C and an additional digest of 4 units of beta - agarase ( M0392S , New England BioLabs ) for 1 hour at 65°C to ensure full agarose breakdown . Supernatants were collected for dimethylmethylene blue ( DMMB ) assays , and chondroitin sulfate from bovine trachea ( C9819 , Sigma Aldrich ) was used as a standard . DMMB solution was added ( 200 µL / well ) and absorbance was measured at 540 nm and 590 nm using a plate reader ( BioTek Cytation 5 , Agilent Technologies ) . For all samples , sGAG quantity was normalized against hydrogel dry weight . Statistical Analysis Results are reported as mean ± standard error ( SE ) for tests using at least three replicates . Two - sided , unpaired t - tests were used in rheometry analyses to detect differences in hydrogel plateau or transition points , in SEM imaging to detect pore diameter differences , and in fluorescence imaging to detect nuclear morphology differences . One - way ANOVA with post - hoc Bonferroni corrections were used to detect temporal influences in addition to hydrogel formulation influences during compression tests and sGAG tests . p - values less than 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Statistical analyses were performed with MATLAB ( R2022a , MathWorks ) . RESULTS Agarose Dominates the Mechanical Characteristics of Composite Hydrogels For all hydrogels , the presence of a crossover point indicated reversible crosslinking ( Figure 1 ) . 4 mg / mL collagen hydrogels reach this crossover at the lowest frequency ( 6 . 07±1 . 48 Hz ) , followed by the two intermediate composites ( 4 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen : 10 . 18±1 . 34 Hz and 2 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen : 8 . 37±1 . 74 Hz ) , then 4 % agarose hydrogels ( 12 . 81±1 . 69 Hz ) . At frequencies above 10 Hz ( 10 – 100 Hz ) , variations in sample responses increase rapidly . The relationship between the storage and loss moduli trends indicated that at low frequencies , the samples exhibit gel - like behavior whereas at higher frequencies , all begin to display viscoelastic - solid like properties . Figure 1 . Addition of collagen to agarose reduced the frequency at which the storage and loss moduli cross . The linear equilibrium modulus is defined at the plateau region of 𝐺′ , which occurs at low frequencies for all hydrogels . 𝐺′ and 𝐺′′ are shown between 0 . 01 and 100 Hz and zoomed into the region between 1 and 10 Hz for 4 % agarose , 4 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen , 2 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen , and 4 mg / mL collagen hydrogels . 3 replicates presented as mean ± SE . Graphs were plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . All hydrogels displayed a plateau in moduli by 30 % strain during strain sweeps ( Figure 2 ) . The agarose - only hydrogel required the least strain ( 1 . 34±0 . 32 % strain ) to achieve the gel - sol transition . Composite 4 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen and 2 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogels achieve this transition point at a higher but insignificantly different strain ( 4 . 82±1 . 39 % and 4 . 72±0 . 74 % strain , respectively ) . The collagen - only hydrogel on the other hand is much more fluid - like and does not reach the gel - sol transition point until 26 . 8±9 . 53 % strain ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Figure 2 . Agarose - only and composite agarose - collagen hydrogels achieved the gel - sol transition point at similar strains . The linear viscoelastic region can be determined with respect to strain where 𝐺′ and 𝐺′′ are calculated between 0 . 1 and 100 % strain for all hydrogels . 3 replicates presented as mean ± SE . Graphs were plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . Within the first 30 minutes of rheometric time sweeps , all hydrogels reached a plateau , indicating that the hydrogels should maintain their mechanical behavior for sustained culture ( Figure 3 ) . A storage modulus greater than the loss modulus indicates solid behavior , of which all agarose - containing hydrogels clearly demonstrate at 30 minutes ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Collagen - only hydrogels , on the other hand , were an order of magnitude softer and demonstrated the opposite effect , though having insignificant differences between storage and loss moduli , in general acting more compliant and fluid - like as compared to agarose - containing hydrogels . Figure 3 . All hydrogel formulations demonstrated stabilized mechanical behavior within thirty minutes . Gel formation was monitored over a period of 30 minutes for all hydrogels . 𝐺′ and 𝐺′′ are presented for all formulations ; however , the moduli of 4 mg / mL collagen hydrogels did not exceed the limits of instrument sensitivity until after five minutes of gel formation . 3 replicates presented as mean ± SE . Graphs were plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . In acellular hydrogels , equilibrium modulus was the main interest , as this metric best represents the stiffness of the hydrogels in a swollen state , the same state these samples will undergo during later cell - laden experiments . Stress relaxation under unconfined compression ( Figure 4 ) demonstrated the 4 % agarose hydrogels had a similar equilibrium modulus ( 24 . 24±5 . 83 kPa ) to the 4 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen hydrogels ( 19 . 72±4 . 68 kPa ) . 2 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen display significantly lower equilibrium moduli ( 7 . 86±0 . 67 kPa ) compared to the 4 % agarose containing hydrogels ( p < 0 . 05 ) in addition to the 4mg / mL collagen hydrogels ( 1 . 93±0 . 46 kPa ) showing significantly lower levels than both 4 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen ( p < 0 . 01 ) and 4 % agarose ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Results demonstrate similarities with shear rheometry outputs , as both storage moduli discussed above , and equilibrium moduli here represent the elastic behavior of viscoelastic materials – of which are more prominent in the 4 % agarose - containing hydrogels . Cell - laden , agarose - containing hydrogels displayed minimal compaction over time , displaying an average diameter increase of 0 . 09 mm and height decrease of 0 . 77 mm from initial dimensions . In comparison , collagen - only hydrogels displayed significant changes ( p < 0 . 05 ) in height and diameter ( 0 . 47±0 . 26 mm and 0 . 80±0 . 32 mm , respectively ) after 21 days of chondrocyte culture . Initially stiffer hydrogels , with respect to the initial equilibrium moduli previously discussed , demonstrate a greater change in instantaneous modulus as compared to softer , collagen dominant hydrogels . Except for these collagen dominant hydrogels , the instantaneous moduli continually increase over 21 days in culture . The final ( day 21 ) instantaneous modulus for 4 % agarose hydrogels is 151 . 77±42 . 58 kPa , for 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen is 121 . 77±28 . 93 kPa , for 2 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen is 47 . 10±7 . 32 kPa , and for 4mg / mL collagen is 21 . 63±2 . 21 kPa ( Figure 4 ) . A similar generalization can be made for the equilibrium moduli over time , though there is much higher variability across time points assessed . Statistically , however , temporal effects were not significant across the 21 days assessed . The introduction and culture of chondrocyte into the hydrogel does cause a decrease in measured equilibrium moduli levels when compared to the acellular hydrogels after 24 hours . In fact , after 21 days in culture , the equilibrium moduli all decrease to roughly half of the initial acellular levels which may be attributed to cellular remodeling of the matrix . The final ( day 21 ) equilibrium modulus for 4 % agarose hydrogels is 11 . 87±2 . 68 kPa , for 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen is 6 . 11±1 . 70 kPa , for 2 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen is 3 . 45±0 . 91 kPa , and for 4mg / mL collagen is 3 . 67±0 . 94 kPa ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 4 . Agarose - only and 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogels displayed similar moduli . Hydrogels ( n = 6 for 24 - hour acellular studies and n = 4 for 21 - day cell - laden studies ) were tested under unconfined , uniaxial compression - based stress relaxation in a randomized order , compared using a one - way ANOVA with post - hoc Bonferroni correction ( α = 0 . 05 ) and presented as mean ± SE . Graphs were plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . Higher Agarose Concentrations are Associated with Larger Pore Diameters Hydrogel pore diameters were compared at 100× magnification via SEM ( Figure 5 ) . The largest pore diameters were found in 4 % agarose hydrogels ( 19 . 57±7 . 61 μm ) followed by 2 % agarose hydrogels ( 19 . 044±7 . 33 μm ) , 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen and 2 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen pore diameters ( 16 . 90±5 . 90 μm and 16 . 21±6 . 55 μm , respectively ) . Significantly smaller ( p < 0 . 05 ) pore diameters were observed in 4 - and 2mg / mL collagen samples ( 9 . 10±2 . 68 μm and 12 . 48±4 . 10 μm , respectively ) . Agarose - only hydrogels demonstrated a positive correlation between concentration levels and resultant pore diameters whereas collagen - only hydrogels demonstrated a negative correlation of pore and fiber diameter at 100× and 10 , 000× magnification levels , respectively ( Figure S1 ) . Figure 5 . Addition of collagen to agarose reduced pore diameters in SEM images . Pore size was quantified using 3 biological replicate 100× images of lyophilized hydrogels and assessed using a one - way ANOVA with post - hoc Bonferroni correction ( α = 0 . 05 ) , presented as mean ± SE . 2000× representative images of hydrogels demonstrate fiber presence and morphology . Scale bars = 20 μm . The graph was plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . Composite Hydrogels Display Intermediate Cell Responses between Agarose - or Collagen - only Hydrogels Since cells were briefly subjected to mechanical and thermal stress during hydrogel formulation methods , cell viability was initially measured directly following cell seeding to establish a baseline . All hydrogels maintained the seeded chondrocytes within their 3 - dimensional matrix and demonstrated continued growth , as assessed via resazurin assays and visual inspection under brightfield microscopy . Agarose - only hydrogels demonstrated the quickest initial increase in growth , collagen - only hydrogels initially lagged but eventually demonstrated the largest growth rates ( Figure 6 ) . Composite hydrogels meanwhile displayed similar rates and followed the progression of expected cell growth curves through the lag , log , and stationary phases ( Figure 6 ) . The average chondrocyte nucleus area was 16 . 86±0 . 32 µm 2 across hydrogel formulations ( Figure 6 ) . Collagen - only hydrogels had the largest areas ( 17 . 95±8 . 24 µm 2 ) with agarose following ( 17 . 22±10 . 45 µm 2 ) . Interestingly , as agarose concentration decreased and collagen content increased in the composite hydrogels , so did nuclear areas ( 16 . 68±8 . 25 µm 2 for 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogels and 15 . 60±9 . 33 µm 2 for 2 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogels ) . Figure 6 . Chondrocyte metabolic activity and nuclear areas , indicators of cell viability and proliferation , demonstrated cell growth across all hydrogels . Cell viability is presented as a percentage of baseline ( 100 % ) levels , using 3 biological replicates . Nuclei areas were compared across sections ( n = 8 ) from hydrogels ( n = 2 ) using a one - way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction ( a = 0 . 05 ) and presented as mean ± SE . Graphs were plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . Hydrogel Formulation is Not a Significant Driver in Observed sGAG Content sGAG was analyzed in terms of absolute content . Interestingly , both composite hydrogels demonstrated a brief decrease in sGAG content between days 3 and 7 before continuing to show continuous increases in content . DMMB results demonstrate on day 3 , sGAG content in 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogels were statistically higher than other groups ( Figure 7 ) . Other than this initial case , however , the temporal influence was the main driver on sGAG content ( p < 0 . 01 ) while formulation alone was not significant driver ( p = 0 . 7 ) , indicating that the addition of agarose in the composite hydrogels does not hinder the ability of chondrocytes to secrete sGAG in vitro at the levels tested . Figure 7 . Collagen - containing hydrogels demonstrated an increase in sGAG content that plateaued by day 21 . One - way ANOVA with post - hoc Bonferroni corrections ( α = 0 . 05 ) were used to detect temporal and hydrogel formulation influences on sGAG content in hydrogels ( n = 3 ) and results are presented as mean ± SE . Graphs were plotted using Matlab and assembled using Biorender . DISCUSSION Biomaterials meeting the mechanical and biochemical requirements for functional environments during cell culture are necessary for mechanotransduction . This study aimed to evaluate agarose - collagen composite hydrogels as a simple , effective option for chondrocyte mechanobiology studies . Four hydrogel formulations were assessed , including a high - concentration , 4 % agarose hydrogel , two common - level collagen concentrations with varied agarose ( 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen and 2 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen ) , and a 4mg / mL collagen hydrogel . Both acellular and prolonged cell - laden studies indicate that high - concentration agarose blended with collagen hydrogels may be a suitable environment for extended , 3 - dimensional chondrocyte culture . Mechanical Properties describe the Hydrogel Structure - Function Relationship Of the sweeps performed , all acellular hydrogels demonstrated linear viscoelastic characteristics that fall within the bounds of common parameters used in loading studies 34 , 40 , a critical factor when developing a hydrogel material meant for culture in physiologically relevant , dynamic conditions . The addition of collagen into agarose did not significantly change the rheologic properties of the hydrogel though it did slightly reduce the elasticity . The blending of collagen and agarose at these concentrations therefore do not seem to impair bond formation during gelation , though it is possible that at higher collagen concentrations , fiber aggregation might interfere with gelation , leading to macroscopic defects , as suggested by the results found by Cambria , et . al . 28 and SEM images of collagen - only samples . Compression testing further described sample mechanical characteristics . Acellular 4 % agarose hydrogels were the stiffest material after gelation , followed by 4 % agarose – 2 mg / mL collagen , which both fall within the lower bounds of native cartilage PCM 19 , 20 . The moduli values of the composite hydrogels demonstrate a dependence on the volume fractions of the agarose and collagen , in which hydrogels with higher agarose content showed improved mechanical properties , reflecting changes to hydrogel moduli reported in other studies . 0 . 5 % agarose hydrogels have an equilibrium modulus ranging from 5 to 8 kPa 29 , 2 % agarose hydrogels at 14 kPa 41 , 3 % agarose hydrogels at roughly 20 kPa 14 , and 4 % agarose hydrogels at 40 kPa 41 . Meanwhile , collagen - only hydrogels demonstrated substantially lower equilibrium moduli following compression 42 , like that of 2 . 3 mg / mL collagen hydrogels , which have a modulus of only 0 . 1 kPa 43 . Cell - laden agarose - containing hydrogels presented the most structural stability over time , in part due to the lack of agarose production by chondrocytes . Since the cells do not produce any enzymes that break down agarose , the material does not erode quickly 30 . Collagen - based hydrogels , on the other hand , are well known to contract over time , decreasing upwards of 70 % in diameter 23 , 27 . Supplementing observations from rheologic testing , the low levels of contraction observed in the composite formulations demonstrated how the agarose component dominated over collagen to maintain the hydrogel shape with time . This presents an advantage for studies in which hydrogels need to be cultured for long durations or undergo loading to mimic physiologic conditions . advantage for studies in which hydrogels need to be cultured for long durations or undergo loading to mimic physiologic conditions . In general , the relaxation behavior of the hydrogels seems to be dominated by the agarose composition . The observed increase in moduli over time may be due to greater fiber engagement or increased matrix deposition as the cells continue to proliferate 32 . While trends observed in this study follow those elsewhere 14 , 28 , 41 , 43 , discrepancies in absolute values may be due to differences in experimental setup , including plate geometries , preconditioning tare loads , and relaxation times in compression testing . Pore diameter sizes seem to follow the same trend as equilibrium moduli , in which 4 % agarose hydrogels , the material with the largest pore diameter , also demonstrate the highest moduli . This related change in pore geometry and subsequent material property are likely attributable to the reduction of hydrogel bonding with decreased agarose concentrations 26 , 29 , 44 , 45 . The composite hydrogels demonstrate similar porosities and moduli but are both lower than agarose - only hydrogels . These composites are double networked since they consist of contrasting component properties and molar concentrations . The differences in crosslinking mechanisms between materials within these hydrogels likely influence the observed trends in pore and modulus values 46 - 48 . Collagen - only hydrogels , meanwhile , demonstrate a negative relationship between porosity and moduli , possibly mediated in part by bond strengths , as there exists a positive relationship between collagen concentration and ionic strength 45 and further a positive relationship between increases in ionic bond strength leads and fiber networks connectivity 30 , 49 , leading to smaller pore and fiber diameters . Furthermore , variability between samples can arise and is demonstrated in literature depending on collagen source , polymerization temperature , and pH , all of which affect crosslinking and cellular interactions 44 , 50 - 52 . Cell and Extracellular Matrix Responses describe the Hydrogel Biofunctionality In this study , the stiffest hydrogel , 4 % agarose - only , led to the quickest and most dramatic increase in proliferation , as measured through mitochondrial activity , although the 4mg / mL collagen - only hydrogels reached similar growth rates within two weeks of culture . Previous reports are inconclusive towards the relationship between hydrogel viscosity and cell proliferation over a 21 - day period . For example , Lee , et . al . , found that higher viscosities led to higher proliferation rates 53 whereas Cambria , et . al . , found the opposite 28 . Potential explanations for the contradictory results may be the influence of contact inhibition or biochemical signaling differences across biomaterials ( gelatin blends versus agarose - collagen blends , respectively ) . Since mammalian cells will not bind to agarose polysaccharides , it is possible that the embedded cells were able to begin proliferating much sooner in a free - floating state as compared to the collagen - containing hydrogels that allowed the cells to take time and bind to fibers prior to entering the exponential growth phase . The composite hydrogels , on the other hand , both resulted in much steadier and more predictable growth curves , a feature that may be advantageous for mechanobiology studies . The average nuclei diameter observed resembles dimensions of chondrocyte nuclei reported at earlier time frames of culture 28 , 54 , 55 and aspect ratios remain circular - like in 2 - dimensional images after 21 days in culture ( Figure S2 ) , indicating the hydrogel material is not significantly influencing the cells to dedifferentiate and may be suitable in preventing terminal differentiation 56 . While it is well established that cells are sensitive to substrate stiffnesses in 2 - dimensional culture 57 - 60 , the influence of substrate stiffness is less understood in 3 - dimensional culture 61 . Additional studies with an increased focus on fluorescence - based microscopy would provide further insight to the morphologies during 3 - dimensional culture . No significant differences in sGAG content by time point were observed among the formulations after day 3 . Over the course of the study , all hydrogels continued to demonstrate greater sGAG content , suggesting continual matrix synthesis . A lack of consensus exists regarding sGAG content in composite hydrogels . While some reports show higher collagen content associated with higher sGAG content 28 , others report the opposite effect , in which a low collagen content led to higher sGAG content 31 . However , as previously referred to , these differences could also be attributable to discrepancies among collagen sources and associated influences on cell behavior . CONCLUSION This study focused on the structural and biofunctional properties of agarose - collagen composite hydrogels . While this study had a low sample size per group due to time constraints on mechanical testing , material availability , and the living nature of the material , it has allowed us to establish the structural properties and compatibility of 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogels . Future studies including gene and protein expression analyses would provide deeper insight into chondrocyte responses to the physical and mechanical cues presented by the composite hydrogels . These hydrogels can be easily and quickly produced , mechanical shear and compressive properties show promising behavior as stable , long - term environments , microscopy images demonstrate homogenous and interconnected networks for cell growth , and preliminary cell - laden studies demonstrate continual proliferation , matrix deposition , and maintained morphology . Overall , the 4 % agarose – 2mg / mL collagen hydrogel formulation showed potential in the context of chondrocyte mechanobiology studies .
