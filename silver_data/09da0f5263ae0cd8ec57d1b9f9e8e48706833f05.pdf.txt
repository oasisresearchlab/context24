Donnelly * and Michael Way { ABSTRACT Vaccinia virus enhances its cell - to - cell spread by inducing Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation . This process is initiated by Src - and Abl - mediated phosphorylation of the viral transmembrane protein A36 , leading to recruitment of a signalling network consisting of Grb2 , Nck , WIP and N - WASP . Nck is a potent activator of N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation . However , recent observations demonstrate that an interaction between Nck and N - WASP is not required for vaccinia actin tail formation . We found that Cdc42 cooperates with Nck to promote actin tail formation by stabilising N - WASP beneath the virus . Cdc42 activation is mediated by the Rho guanine - nucleotide - exchange factor ( GEF ) intersectin - 1 ( ITSN1 ) , which is recruited to the virus prior to its actin - based motility . Moreover , Cdc42 , ITSN1 and N - WASP function collaboratively in a feed - forward loop to promote vaccinia - induced actin polymerisation . Outside the context of infection , we demonstrate that ITSN1 also functions together with Cdc42 , Nck and N - WASP during phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor . Our observations suggest that ITSN1 is an important general regulator of Cdc42 - , Nck - and N - WASP - dependent actin polymerisation . KEY WORDS : Cdc42 , Intersectin - 1 , ITSN1 , N - WASP , Vaccinia , Phagocytosis INTRODUCTION A number of intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation to promote their cell - to - cell spread ( Haglund and Welch , 2011 ; Ireton , 2013 ; Welch and Way , 2013 ) . Pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes and baculovirus promote actin - based motility by encoding proteins that directly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Haglund and Welch , 2011 ; Ireton , 2013 ) . In contrast , others such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and vaccinia virus use more elaborate mechanisms to achieve the same goal ( Campellone , 2010 ; Haglund and Welch , 2011 ; Welch and Way , 2013 ) . It is therefore not surprising , that investigations into exactly how these different pathogens induce actin polymerisation have provided unprecedented insights into the proteins and mechanisms regulating the recruitment and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Vaccinia induces actin polymerisation when newly assembled virus particles leaving an infected cell fuse with and remain attached to the plasma membrane ( Cudmore et al . , 1996 ; Hollinshead et al . , 2001 ; Ward and Moss , 2001a ; Doceul et al . , 2010 ) . These adherent extracellular viruses induce an outside - in signal that locally activates Src and Abl family kinases ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Newsome et al . , 2004 ; Reeves et al . , 2005 ; Newsome et al . , 2006 ) . This results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine 112 and 132 of the viral transmembrane protein A36 ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Newsome et al . , 2004 ; Newsome et al . , 2006 ) , which is polarised beneath the virus in part by adaptor protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) - mediated recruitment of clathrin following viral fusion with the plasma membrane ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Phosphorylated tyrosine 112 of A36 recruits Nck , which interacts with a complex of WIP and N - WASP , resulting in the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin polymerisation ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Moreau et al . , 2000 ; Snapper et al . , 2001 ; Zettl and Way , 2002 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . Tyrosine 132 of A36 recruits Grb2 , which acts as a secondary adaptor to help stabilise Nck , WIP and N - WASP beneath the virus and promote actin polymerisation ( Scaplehorn et al . , 2002 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . Clathrin - mediated clustering of A36 also functions to stabilise N - WASP and enhance the rate of actin tail formation ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Ultimately , Arp2 / 3 - induced actin polymerisation propels the virus away from the cell surface towards neighbouring cells , enhancing the spread of infection ( Cudmore et al . , 1995 ; Cudmore et al . , 1996 ; Hollinshead et al . , 2001 ; Ward and Moss , 2001a ; Doceul et al . , 2010 ) . Nck and N - WASP are essential for vaccinia actin tail formation , as they are required to recruit the WIP – N - WASP complex and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , respectively ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Moreau et al . , 2000 ; Snapper et al . , 2001 ; Zettl and Way , 2002 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , until recently , the role of WIP in vaccinia actin tail formation was more obscure ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . Previous observations outside the context of infection have shown that WIP inhibits the ability of N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex until it receives an appropriate signalling input ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Takano et al . , 2008 ) . However , we found that WIP also plays an essential role in linking Nck to N - WASP ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , dissection of the signalling network unexpectedly demonstrated that the interaction between Nck and N - WASP is not essential for vaccinia actin tail formation ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . This suggests that additional factors are required to regulate the ability of N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex beneath the viral particle . The presence of an additional factor might also explain why the turnover rate of N - WASP beneath the virus is , 3 . 5 times slower than that of Nck and WIP , even though they are both required for its recruitment ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) .

We further show interdependency between N - WASP and Cdc42 , together with a role for the Rho guanine - nucleotide - exchange factor ( GEF ) ITSN1 in Cdc42 activation . Our findings with vaccinia could also be translated to phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor , further illustrating the utility of pathogens as models to understand how signalling networks regulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation . RESULTS Cdc42 enhances vaccinia - induced actin polymerisation Previously , we have shown that Cdc42 is recruited to vaccinia , but does not appear to play a role in promoting actin tail formation ( Moreau et al . , 2000 ) . However , given that the binding of Nck to N - WASP is not essential for this process ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) , combined with the slow turnover of N - WASP as compared to that of Nck and WIP ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) , we decided to re - examine whether Cdc42 plays a supporting role during vaccinia actin tail formation . In agreement with Moreau et al . ( Moreau et al . , 2000 ) , GFP – Cdc42 localised to the tip of vaccinia - induced actin tails beneath extracellular virions ( Fig . 1A ) . We also found that extracellular viral particles recruited endogenous Cdc42 ( Fig . 1A ) . To analyse the contribution of Cdc42 in actin tail formation , we infected N - WASP 2 / 2 MEFs stably expressing GFP - tagged wild - type ( WT ) N - WASP or the H208D mutant , which is deficient in Cdc42 binding ( Miki et al . , 1998 ; Abdul - Manan et al . , 1999 ) . We found no difference in the ability of WT and H208D N - WASP to promote actin tail formation when infected cells were assessed for the presence of at least one tail or not , as performed in Moreau et al . ( Moreau et al . , 2000 ) ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Quantification of the number of actin tails per cell , however , revealed a significant decrease when N - WASP was unable to interact with Cdc42 ( Fig . 1B , C ) . The number of extracellular viruses inducing actin tails was also reduced ( Fig . 1C ) . Consistent with these observations , expression of dominant - negative GFP – Cdc42 - N17 in infected HeLa cells also decreased the ability of vaccinia to induce actin tails ( Fig . 1D ; supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . As Cdc42 - N17 has been shown to cause effects in the absence of Cdc42 ( Czuchra et al . , 2005 ) , and as the H208D mutant might also impact on interactions with the Cdc42 - like GTPases TC10 or TCL ( Aspenstro¨m et al . , 2004 ) , we additionally used siRNA to deplete Cdc42 . Loss of Cdc42 also decreased the formation of vaccinia - induced actin tails ( Fig . 1D ; supplementary material Fig . S1 ) , confirming a positive and specific role for Cdc42 during N - WASP - dependent vaccinia - induced actin polymerisation . Cdc42 and Nck cooperate to stabilise N - WASP and promote actin tail formation To analyze the interplay between Nck and Cdc42 in the system , we examined the consequence of the loss of their binding to N - WASP by combining the H208D mutation with N - WASP - D Nck , which is deficient in Nck interactions ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . N - WASP 2 / 2 MEFs stably expressing N - WASP - D Nck - H208D had significantly fewer actin tails than those expressing the H208D or D Nck mutations alone , suggesting that Nck and Cdc42 act cooperatively within the vaccinia signalling network ( Fig . 2A ) . The ability of vaccinia to induce actin tails directly impacts on the cell - to - cell spread of the virus , the efficiency of which can be assessed from the size of plaques formed in confluent cell monolayers ( Ward and Moss , 2001b ; Doceul et al . , 2010 ; Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . As expected , in the absence of N - WASP and actin tail formation , the plaques were very small because viral cell - to - cell spread is inefficient ( Fig . 2B ) . Stable expression of GFP – N - WASP in N - WASP 2 / 2 cells significantly enhanced viral spread . The N - WASP - H208D mutant was less effective in promoting viral spread , and the combined mutation ( D Nck - H208D ) was even more defective , consistent with their reduced ability to support actin tail formation ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Our previous observations have shown that binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated tyrosine 132 of A36 helps to stabilise N - WASP beneath the virus and promote actin polymerisation ( Scaplehorn et al . , 2002 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . Given this , we examined whether Grb2 is responsible for the remaining actin tails seen in N - WASP 2 / 2 cells expressing GFP – N - WASP - D Nck - H208D . We found that the proportion of cells infected with vaccinia expressing A36 - Y132F with one or more actin tails was significantly reduced when N - WASP cannot bind Nck and Cdc42 ( Fig . 2D ) . The number of actin tails was also diminished compared to that induced by the WT virus ( strain WR ) ( Fig . 1C ; Fig . 2D ) . Furthermore , the actin structures induced by the A36 - Y132F virus resembled puncta rather than an elongated tail ( Fig . 2C ) . Further to this , analysis of the speed of viral actin - based movements showed a significant decrease in motility for both the H208D mutation and the combined D Nck H208D mutant in both WR and A36 - Y132F infections ( supplementary material Fig . S2A ) . Taken together , these results highlight the importance of Cdc42 in actin tail formation . To examine whether the changes in actin tail formation reflect underlying differences in the ability of Cdc42 to stabilise N - WASP , we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments ( Fig . 2E ) . Consistent with our previous observations , we found that the half - life of recovery for GFP – N - WASP is 2 . 72 6 0 . 20 seconds ( 6 s . e . m . ) ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Humphries et al . , 2012 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . We recently demonstrated that the loss of Nck binding results in a significant , albeit modest , increase in the rate of GFP – N - WASP - D Nck turnover ( 2 . 41 6 0 . 13 as compared to 2 . 94 6 0 . 17 seconds ) ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , we found that an inability to interact with Cdc42 results in a dramatic increase in the rate of GFP – N - WASP - H208D exchange , with the half - life of recovery dropping to 1 . 18 6 0 . 10 seconds ( Fig . 2E ) . Addition of the D Nck mutation further decreased the GFP – N - WASP - D Nck - H208D half - life to 0 . 86 6 0 . 06 seconds ( Fig . 2E ) . To further confirm the importance of Cdc42 , we also performed FRAP experiments on Cdc42 - depleted cells . In the absence of Cdc42 , the turnover of N - WASP was again significantly enhanced as the half - life of recovery changed from 2 . 67 6 0 . 19 to 1 . 40 6 0 . 12 seconds ( supplementary material Fig . S2B ) . Our observations demonstrate that the interaction with both Cdc42 and Nck acts to stabilise N - WASP within the signalling network . However , it is Cdc42 that plays the major role in stabilising N - WASP to promote actin tail formation . Cdc42 and N - WASP act in a feed - forward loop To investigate further the relationship between Cdc42 and N - WASP , we took advantage of the WH1 - CRIB domains of N - WASP , which unlike the full - length protein , are unable to interact with Nck or activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Consequently , WH1 - CRIB acts as a dominant negative for actin tail formation when expressed in infected cells , as it competes with endogenous N - WASP for WIP binding and recruitment to the virus ( Fig . 3A ) ( Moreau et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , we found that GFP – WH1 - CRIB containing the H208D mutation was far less effective at RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2014 ) 127 , 673 – 685 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 141366 674 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e blocking actin tail formation , consistent with its weaker recruitment and a more prominent presence of endogenous N - WASP on the virus ( Fig . 3A ) . This could suggest that Cdc42 participates in N - WASP recruitment , but it is more likely to reflect the inability of GFP – WH1 - CRIB - H208D to be stabilised beneath the virus after its recruitment . We next took advantage of N - WASP 2 / 2 MEFs to determine whether Cdc42 acts upstream of N - WASP in the vaccinia signalling network . We found that , in the absence of N - WASP , there was little recruitment of GFP – Cdc42 to virus particles ( Fig . 3B ) . Consistent with this , live imaging revealed that the level of GFP – Cdc42 recruited to virus particles increases during Fig . 1 . Cdc42 promotes actin tail formation . ( A ) Immunofluorescence images of vaccinia - infected HeLa cells . Viral particles are highlighted with antibody staining against the viral protein B5 . As the epitope of the antibody becomes exposed during viral fusion , intracellular ( B5 ) and extracellular ( exB5 ) particles were determined by staining either post or prior to permeabilisation , respectively . GFP – Cdc42 is associated with extracellular particles , on the tip of the actin tail , and colocalises with N - WASP ( white arrows ) .

Analysing the intensity of GFP - tagged Nck and N - WASP on the virus revealed that their levels also increase during actin tail formation ( Fig . 3C ; supplementary material Movies 2 , 3 ) . Moreover , Nck and N - WASP are recruited to the virus slightly before Cdc42 . However , once Cdc42 is recruited , its intensity increases at a similar rate to that of Nck and N - WASP , with all signals plateauing at a similar time ( Fig . 3C ) . This suggests that after its initial Nck - dependent recruitment , mediated by WIP , N - WASP interacts with Cdc42 to maintain sustained actin polymerisation . ITSN - 1L promotes actin tail formation To further investigate the interdependency between Cdc42 and N - WASP , we sought to determine how Cdc42 is activated by vaccinia . As vaccinia transiently recruits clathrin in an AP - 2 - dependent manner prior to actin tail formation ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) , we examined whether ITSN1 , an endocytic protein and Cdc42 GEF that also interacts with N - WASP ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ; Hunter et al . , 2013 ) , is recruited to the virus . Consistent with its role in endocytosis , immunofluorescence analysis revealed ITSN1 is present in numerous punctate structures ( Fig . 4A ) . However , in vaccinia - infected cells , we additionally found that endogenous ITSN1 associated with extracellular viruses inducing actin tails ( Fig . 4A ) . The ITSN1 antibody detects both ITSN - 1L ( long ) and ITSN - 1S ( short ) , the latter of which has no GEF activity because it lacks the C - terminal DH - PH domains found in ITSN - 1L ( Hussain et al . , 1999 ; Hussain et al . , 2001 ) . We found that GFP - tagged ITSN - 1L and ITSN - 1S are both present on the tips of actin tails ( Fig . 4A ) . ITSN1 also colocalises with AP - 2 - associated virus particles , suggesting that ITSN1 is recruited upstream of actin tail formation at the point of clathrin accumulation ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistent with this , ITSN1 is recruited to the virus in N - WASP 2 / 2 MEFs even in the absence of robust Cdc42 recruitment ( Fig . 4B ) . RNAi - mediated loss of AP - 2 , however , did not impact on the localisation of ITSN1 on the virus , suggesting that its recruitment is independent of AP - 2 and clathrin ( Fig . 4C ) . To determine the functional relevance of ITSN1 in actin tail formation , we used RNAi to deplete both ITSN1 isoforms ( Fig . 5A ) . Loss of ITSN1 resulted in a significant decrease in the ability of extracellular virus to nucleate an actin tail ( Fig . 5B , C ) . This reduction could be fully rescued by expression of RNAi - resistant ITSN - 1L but not ITSN - 1S , suggesting that the GEF activity of ITSN1 is required ( Fig . 5D ) . Importantly , depletion of ITSN1 did not affect recruitment of AP - 2 to viral particles ( Fig . 5E ) . Taken together , our observations suggest that although ITSN1 is recruited at the time of clathrin accumulation , its role appears distinct from the clustering activity of AP - 2 and clathrin in actin tail formation . ITSN1 functions in the same pathway as Cdc42 To investigate whether ITSN1 promotes actin tail formation by activating Cdc42 , we examined the consequence of expressing dominant - negative Cdc42 - N17 in the absence of ITSN1 ( Fig . 6A ) . Depletion of ITSN1 or expression of GFP – Cdc42 - N17 resulted in an equivalent decrease in the number of extracellular viruses inducing actin tails . When combined , there was no enhanced reduction , suggesting that ITSN1 and Cdc42 function in the same pathway ( Fig . 6A ) . To examine possible cooperative interactions between Cdc42 , ITSN1 and N - WASP , we performed pull down assays on HeLa cells expressing GFP - tagged versions of N - WASP in cells depleted of endogenous N - WASP by RNAi ( Fig . 6B ) . Cells were additionally expressing GST – Cdc42 to allow for examination of its interaction with N - WASP and the H208D mutant . As expected , we found that introduction of the H208D mutation into GFP – N - WASP eliminated binding to GST – Cdc42 . In contrast , the H208D mutation had no impact on the interaction of GFP – N - WASP with endogenous ITSN1 ( Fig . 6B ) . Depletion of ITSN1 , however , diminished binding of GST – Cdc42 to GFP – N - WASP ( Fig . 6B ) . These data are consistent with ITSN - 1L acting as a GEF for Cdc42 to promote the interaction of its GTP - bound form with N - WASP ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) . Taken together , our data suggest that , once recruited by Nck , through WIP , N - WASP engages with ITSN1 , activating Cdc42 . This , in turn , binds and stabilises N - WASP , with all three components acting together in a feed - forward loop . ITSN1 promotes N - WASP - mediated Fc gamma receptor phagocytosis Given our observations with vaccinia , we decided to examine whether Cdc42 , ITSN1 and Nck also act cooperatively during an N - WASP - dependent cellular process outside the context of infection . Recent work has shown that Nck and Cdc42 act synergistically to promote N - WASP - dependent phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor ( Dart et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore investigated whether ITSN1 also contributes to this pathway . We found that GFP – ITSN - 1L is recruited to phagocytic cups along with GFP - tagged Nck , Cdc42 and N - WASP , as has been previously described ( Fig . 7A ) ( Dart et al . , 2012 ) . To determine whether ITSN1 participates in phagocytic uptake , we depleted ITSN1 as above ( Fig . 5A ) and quantified the ability of HeLa cells transiently expressing the Fc gamma receptor IIa to phagocytose sheep red blood cells ( RBCs ) ( Fig . 7B ) . Although siRNA treatment did not affect the attachment of RBCs to HeLa cells ( Ai , the total number of RBCs per cell ) , it did lead to a decrease in the number that were internalised ( Pi , number of internalised RBCs per cell ) ( Fig . 7B ) . Consequently , the percentage phagocytosis was significantly reduced , showing that ITSN1 enhances phagocytic uptake . To determine whether ITSN1 regulates the same signalling pathway within phagocytosis as during vaccinia actin tail formation , we combined its depletion with that of Nck1 , Cdc42 or N - WASP ( Fig . 7C ) . As previously observed , depletion of Fig . 2 . The interaction of N - WASP with Nck and Cdc42 is important for viral spread .

S3 ) ( Dart et al . , 2012 ) . The combined loss of ITSN1 with Cdc42 , however , led to no further reduction in phagocytosis ( Fig . 7D ; supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . Furthermore , the same phenotype was observed when ITSN1 depletion was combined with loss of Nck or N - WASP ( Fig . 7D ; supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . These data confirm that ITSN1 contributes to the actin polymerisation driven by Nck , Cdc42 and N - WASP during phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor . DISCUSSION N - WASP , and the related haematopoietic - specific WASP , play important roles in stimulating Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation during a variety of cellular processes , such as endocytosis and phagocytosis , as well as during invadopodia and podosome formation ( Mizutani et al . , 2002 ; Benesch et al . , 2005 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ; Park and Cox , 2009 ) . N - WASP is also essential for actin - based motility of a variety of intracellular pathogens ( Lommel et al . , 2001 ; Snapper et al . , 2001 ; Lommel et al . , 2004 ; Stamm et al . , 2005 ; Dodding and Way , 2009 ) .

In both cases , Nck and Cdc42 act in a cooperative manner , with the activity of Cdc42 additionally regulated by the GEF ITSN1 . Nck and Cdc42 , however , appear to play different primary roles within the vaccinia - signalling network , even though both proteins are capable of activating N - WASP in vitro ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) . Nck is recruited to the virus in response to Src - and Abl - family - kinase - mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 112 in the viral transmembrane protein A36 ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Newsome et al . , 2004 ; Reeves et al . , 2005 ; Newsome et al . , 2006 ) .

Once recruited by Nck , the WIP – N - WASP complex is further stabilised by an interaction with Grb2 , a downstream response to tyrosine 132 phosphorylation in A36 ( Scaplehorn et al . , 2002 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast to Nck , Grb2 is not essential for actin tail formation , although it does enhance the ability of the virus to induce actin polymerisation , consistent with its capacity to bind and activate N - WASP ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) . Nck contains three SH3 domains that are capable of interacting with the proline - rich regions of WIP and N - WASP ( Anto ´ n et al . , 1998 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . Our recent observations have , however , shown that the WIP – WASP complex is recruited to the virus by an interaction of the second SH3 domain of Nck with WIP ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . N - WASP is thus recruited to the virus because it is bound to WIP , rather than by directly binding to Nck in the first instance . Furthermore , the loss of the ability of Nck to bind N - WASP did not inhibit vaccinia actin tail formation , although it did reduce tail length and slightly increased the turnover rate of N - WASP on the virus ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . The turnover rate of an N - WASP mutant that is deficient in Nck binding , however , still did not approach that of Nck and WIP , even in the absence of Grb2 ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) .

Our observations examining the ability of N - WASP - H208D to induce actin tails in N - WASP 2 / 2 MEFs , as well as the decreased rate of vaccinia actin - based motility in this background , have now clearly demonstrated that Cdc42 is the missing factor . Consistent with this , loss of the ability of N - WASP to bind Cdc42 has a greater impact on virus actin tail formation than the loss of Nck binding , suggesting that Cdc42 plays a more important role than Nck in stabilising and activating N - WASP within the signalling network . Nevertheless , Nck still contributes , as loss of the ability of N - WASP to bind Cdc42 and Nck has a larger impact than that of Cdc42 alone . The combined loss of Cdc42 and Nck binding to N - WASP did not , however , fully abrogate actin polymerisation , even in the absence of Grb2 recruitment by vaccinia expressing A36 - Y132F . This suggests that additional factor ( s ) besides Nck , Cdc42 and Grb2 can contribute to the ability of N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex during vaccinia actin tail formation . Previous in vitro observations have demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] can synergise with both Nck and Cdc42 to promote N - WASP activation ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2005 ; Tomasevic et al . , 2007 ; Rivera et al . , 2009 ) . The ability of N - WASP to be activated by Cdc42 , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and SH3 - containing adapters , such as Nck and Grb2 , allows it to connect a wide variety of signalling inputs to Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation . Moreover , the ability of multiple inputs to cooperatively activate N - WASP allows for exquisite regulation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation ( Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2005 ; Padrick et al . , 2008 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . The relative contribution of these different inputs in activating N - WASP in vitro , however , varies depending on the individual study . More importantly , the majority of these studies have been performed in the absence of WIP and might therefore not fully reflect the situation in vivo . Indeed , in vitro , Cdc42 alone is not able to activate a WIP – N - WASP complex to stimulate Arp2 / 3 ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) . It would be surprising , given previous studies , if PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 did not contribute to vaccinia actin tail formation by helping to stabilise N - WASP in an open active conformation . It should , however , not be forgotten that the SH3 domains in ITSN1 , as well as those in Src and Abl family kinases , might also contribute activating inputs into N - WASP in the absence of Cdc42 and Nck . Indeed , the SH3 domain of the tyrosine kinase Arg , which is recruited by vaccinia ( Reeves et al . , 2005 ; Newsome et al . , 2006 ) , is capable of activating N - WASP in vitro ( Miller et al . , 2010 ) . Nevertheless , our analysis suggests that in the absence of Grb2 recruitment , Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin based motility of vaccinia is principally driven by Cdc42 - and Nck - dependent activation of N - WASP . We have recently observed that vaccinia transiently recruits AP - 2 and clathrin prior to actin tail formation ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Given this , we examined whether the virus activates Cdc42 by recruiting ITSN1 , a Cdc42 GEF that interacts with both AP - 2 and N - WASP ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ; Hunter et al . , 2013 ) . We found that ITSN1 is recruited upstream of actin tail formation as it can associate with extracellular viruses attached to the plasma membrane in N - WASP 2 / 2 MEFs . The upstream localisation of ITSN1 is consistent with its role as an early endocytic protein , suggesting the same signals that are responsible for AP - 2 and clathrin recruitment are also responsible for the initial recruitment of ITSN1 ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . However , ITSN1 was not required for the AP - 2 - and clathrin - dependent regulation of actin tail formation . This is probably because of the presence of other early endocytic proteins that could act in a redundant manner with ITSN1 to regulate AP - 2 and / or clathrin recruitment and / or organisation . ITSN1 is associated with the virus prior to actin tail formation . We therefore envisage that ITSN - 1L promotes the activation of Cdc42 upon engagement with N - WASP , which is recruited as a complex with WIP downstream of Nck ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . This is consistent with a model put forward by Hussain et al . ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) , which suggests that the interaction of ITSN - 1L with N - WASP enhances its GEF activity towards Cdc42 . The local activation of Cdc42 in turn contributes to N - WASP activation , in addition to providing a stabilising interaction to maintain Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation . Such a scheme would account for the lag in Cdc42 recruitment to the virus during initiation of actin polymerisation as compared to that of Nck and N - WASP . A similar situation also appears to be the case for phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor , as Cdc42 failed to robustly localise to phagocytic cups in the absence of N - WASP ( Dart et al . , 2012 ) . Studies on neuronal cells have shown that ITSN - 1L can activate Cdc42 to promote secretory granule exocytosis in an N - WASP - dependent manner , and expression of a DH - domain - containing construct in neuroblastoma cells stimulates Cdc42 - dependent neurite extension in response to serum starvation ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ; Gasman et al . , 2004 ; Malacombe et al . , 2006 ) . Our observations , with vaccinia and phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor , suggest that ITSN1 is likely to have a more general role in other Cdc42 – N - WASP - dependent processes beyond neuronal cell lineages . Moreover , using vaccinia has allowed us to dissect the relative contribution of Cdc42 and Nck in promoting N - WASP - dependent actin polymerisation through the Arp2 / 3 complex . The conservation of this signalling network during phagocytosis mediated by the Fc gamma receptor further supports the use of vaccinia in elucidating mechanisms regulating N - WASP - dependent activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Antibodies against the following proteins were used for immunofluorescence and immunoblotting : Cdc42 ( P - 1 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ) , B5 ( Hiller and Weber , 1985 ) , N - WASP ( Moreau et al . , 2000 ) , ITSN1 ( Hussain et al . , 1999 , and 118262 , AbCam , UK ) , Cortactin ( 4F11 , Millipore , USA ) , AP - 2 ( 2730 , AbCam , UK ) , Nck ( 06 - 288 , Millipore , USA ) , GST ( G7781 , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , b - actin ( AC - 74 , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , GFP ( 3E1 , Cancer Research UK ) . Secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen , USA . Phalloidin - conjugated Texas Red ( Invitrogen , USA ) was also used . Constructs and stable cell lines The pE / L - GFP - Cdc42 and pE / L - GST - Cdc42 constructs have been previously described ( Moreau et al . , 2000 ; Arakawa et al . , 2007a ) . Human intersectin - 1L and intersectin - 1S clones were provided by Stephane Gasman ( INCI , France ) ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ; Malacombe et al . , 2006 ) . GFP - tagged human ITSN - 1L and ITSN - IS were generating by PCR by inserting the product into the Not I - Spe I sites of the vaccinia expression vector pE / L - GFP ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ) . RNAi - resistant pE / L - GFP - ITSN - 1L / - IS expression constructs and pLVX - GFP - N - WASP - H208D constructs were generated by site - directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange mutagenesis protocol ( Stratagene , USA ) ( Donnelly et al . , 2013 ) . For RNAi - resistant constructs the sequence corresponding RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2014 ) 127 , 673 – 685 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 141366 683 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e to the second ITSN1 siRNA oligonucleotide was subjected to mutagenesis at each base pair to alter the DNA sequence but not its protein coding . Stable GFP – N - WASP - expressing cell lines were established as previously described ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Infection assays Cells were infected with the WR strain of vaccinia virus , WR expressing A36 - Y132F or with WR expressing an RFP - tagged version of the viral core protein A3 ( Scaplehorn et al . , 2002 ; Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) . HeLa cells and MEFs were fixed at 9 and 15 hours post - infection respectively . Cells were processed for immunofluorescence as previously described ( Arakawa et al . , 2007b ; Arakawa et al . , 2007a ) . For assays involving transfection , cells were transfected 4 hours post - infection with the indicated construct using effectene ( Qiagen , Germany ) and fixed 9 hours post - infection . siRNA treatment was as previously described ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) , briefly cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA using the HiPerFect fast - forward protocol ( Qiagen , Germany ) and treated for 48 hours before use . The following siRNA oligonucleotides were used : ITSN1 ( 5 9 - GGCCAUAACUGUAGAGGAA - 3 9 ) and ( 5 9 - GAUAUCAGAUGUCGAUUGA - 3 9 ) , AP - 2 ( 5 9 - AGCAUGUGCACGC - UGGCCA - 3 9 ) ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Pools of siRNA were obtained commercially ( Dharmacon , USA ) . Plaque assays were performed as previously described , with the exception that stable MEF lines were used instead of A549 cells ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Live imaging and FRAP experiments were also performed as previously described ( Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . GFP - trap pull - downs To analyse the interaction between N - WASP , ITSN1 and Cdc42 , 6 - cm dishes of HeLa cells were treated with N - WASP siRNA and either control or ITSN1 siRNA for 56 hours . Cells were then infected with WR virus , and 1 hour post infection transfected with pE / L expression vectors encoding GFP , GFP – N - WASP or GFP – N - WASP - H208D . Cells were additionally transfected with pE / L - GST - Cdc42 . Cells were lysed and the GFP - trap experiment was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation ( Chromotek , Germany ) . The samples were then probed with antibodies against GFP and ITSN , and GST to look at the interaction with overexpressed GST – Cdc42 . Phagocytosis assays Cells were transfected with the Fc gamma receptor IIa ( Dart et al . , 2012 ) , using fugene 6 ( Promega , USA ) . At 20 hours after transfection , the phagocytosis assay was performed . Sheep RBCs ( TCS Biosciences , UK ) were washed with gelatin veronal buffer ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and incubated with rabbit anti - RBC IgG ( MP Biomedicals , France ) on a rotating wheel for 30 minutes . Meanwhile , HeLa cells were serum starved for 1 hour . RBCs were washed again , resuspended in serum - free medium , and then added to the cells . Cells were incubated at 4 ˚ C for 15 minutes , then at 37 ˚ C for 30 minutes before fixation . The internalisation of RBCs was determined by staining with a secondary antibody pre - and post - permeabilisation . The data are normalised with respect to control ; Ai represents the total number of RBCs per cell , and Pi the number of internalised RBCs per cell . The percentage phagocytosis is the number of internalised RBCs as a percentage of total RBCs per cell . Microscope image acquisition For imaging of fixed samples , a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Cool Snap HQ cooled CCD camera , external Prior Scientific filter wheels ( DAPI ; FITC ; Texas Red ; Cy5 ) and a 63 6 1 . 4 NA Plan Achromat objective was used . The system was controlled with MetaMorph 6 . 3r7 software . Live - cell imaging and FRAP was carried out on a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope equipped with a Plan Achromat 63 6 1 . 4 NA Ph3 M27 oil lens , an Evolve 512 camera and a Yokagawa CSUX spinning disk . Imaging was carried out at 37 ˚ C , in Phenol - Red - free MEM with 40 mM HEPES . The system was controlled by Slidebook 5 . 0 , movies were analysed using either the Slidebook or MetaMorph software . Quantification and figure preparation Cells were analysed on the basis of an established viral factory using DAPI staining , to allow determination of infection . The percentage of cells inducing actin tails , and the number of tails was determined manually . For the percentage of cells , 100 cells were counted in three separate experiments . For the number of tails and percentage of extracellular virus inducing actin , ten cells each were counted in three separate experiments . To measure the intensity of GFP - tagged Cdc42 , Nck and N - WASP during actin tail formation , the intensity was recorded for 30 different nucleation events using Slidebook software ( 3i Intelligent Imaging Innovations , USA ) . The GFP signal was normalised to the maximum intensity . Graphs and statistics were compiled using Prism ( Graphpad software , USA ) , comparison of two data sets was carried out using a Student’s t - test and , for larger data sets , a one - way ANOVA was performed with multiple comparison analysis . FRAP analysis was as previously described ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ; Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . Plaque size was measured using ImageJ ( NIH , USA ) . All figures were generated using Adobe software ( Adobe , USA ) . P , 0 . 05 , P , 0 . 01 and P , 0 . 001 is represented by single , double and triple asterisks , respectively .
