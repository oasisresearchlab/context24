Tsaturyan 3 Received : 12 February 2019 / Accepted : 17 August 2019 / Published online : 18 September 2019 © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 Abstract Tropomyosin is a dimer coiled - coil actin - binding protein . Adjacent tropomyosin molecules connect each other ‘head - to - tail’ via an overlap junction and form a continuous strand that winds around an actin filament and controls the actin – myosin interaction . High cooperativity of muscle contraction largely depends on tropomyosin characteristics . Here we summarise experimental evidence that local peculiarities of tropomyosin structure have long - range effects and determine functional properties of the strand , including changes in its bending stiffness and interaction with actin and myosin . Point mutations and posttranslational modifications help to probe the roles of the conserved ‘non - canonical’ residues , clusters of stabilising and destabilising core residues , and core gap in tropomyosin function . The data suggest that tropomyosin structural lability including a diversity of homo - and heterodimers of different isoforms provide a balance of stiffness , flexibility , and strength of interaction with partner sarcomere proteins necessary for fine - tuning of Ca 2 + regulation in various types of striated muscles .

A Tpm molecule is a coiled - coil dimer formed by two parallel α - helices . Tpm molecules bind each other in a head - to - tail manner via overlap junctions and form two long strands which bind actin filament following its helical symmetry ( Perry 2001 ; Brown and Cohen 2005 ; Gunning et al . 2008 ; Nevzorov and Levitsky 2011 ; Lehman et al . 2013 ; Khaitlina 2015 ; Hitchcock - DeGregori and Barua 2017 ) . In striated muscle , Tpm is one of the major participants in Ca 2 + - regulation of contraction . It binds another regula - tory protein , troponin ( Tn ) , in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry to form , together with actin , a regulated thin filament . In the absence of Ca 2 + , the inhibitory domain of Tn subunit , Tn – I , binds actin and anchors Tpm in a blocked state where it steri - cally blocks myosin - binding sites on actin ( McKillop and Geeves 1993 ) . Upon Ca 2 + binding to Tn , the inhibitory domain releases from actin and the Tpm – Tn strand shifts azimuthally with respect to the axis of the actin filament to the closed state in which myosin binding sites on actin are partially open . In this state , myosin can bind actin , ini - tially weakly ( McKillop and Geeves 1993 ) and presumably * Andrey K .

The subse - quent transition of the weakly bound actin – myosin com - plex to a strongly bound state causes a further shift of the Tpm – Tn strand to the open state in which the neighbour actin sites also become accessible for myosin binding . Muscle Tpm consists of seven pseudo - repeats of ~ 40 amino acid residues each ( McLachlan and Stewart 1976 ) . Each repeat corresponds to an actin monomer so that a Tpm molecule binds and controls availability for myosin binding to seven consequent actin monomers on a long F - actin helix . Tpm strand follows the helical actin symmetry with a period of ~ 36 nm . The axial repeat of Tpm ( and Tn ) molecules is longer , ca 38 . 5 nm = 7 × 5 . 5 nm , where ca 5 . 5 nm is the axial distance between neighbour actin monomers ( Squire et al . 2017 ) . Besides the helical repeat , Tpm has seven - residue ‘heptad’ ( a – b – c – d – e – f – g ) repeat typical for coiled - coils . The a and d core positions correspond to the contact between the α - helices . They are usually occupied by hydro - phobic residues that provide tight hydrophobic interaction holding the helices together . Neighbour e and g residues are usually oppositely charged so that they can form salt bridge stiffening and stabilising the coiled - coil structure . Residues b , c , and f face outside the coiled - coil and may participate in the interaction with partner proteins : F - actin , myosin , and Tn ( Mason and Arndt 2004 ) . The peculiarities of structural and mechanical character - istics of Tpm determine the cooperativity of regulation of muscle contraction . The cooperativity is characterised by the length of the regulatory unit or by the slope ( the Hill parameter ) of Ca 2 + dependence of muscle force or the slid - ing velocity of regulated thin filaments over myosin in an in vitro motility assay ( Gordon et al . 2000 ) . A theory that treats a Tpm strand as a continuous elastic bar held in a vicinity of a specific angular position on the surface of an actin filament ( F - actin ) by electrostatic interaction between charged Tpm and actin residues was developed ( Smith et al . 2003 ; Smith and Geeves 2003 ) . It suggests that the binding of TnI or myosin to F - actin causes local strand displace - ments in opposite directions . The displacement caused by the binding affects not only seven actin sites covered by a Tpm molecule but expands further to neighbour Tpm mol - ecules due to bending stiffness of the Tpm – Tn strand . The length of the effective regulatory unit , corresponding a set of actin sites , accessibility of which for myosin heads is affected by binding of Ca 2 + to a Tn molecule or by binding of a myosin head to F - actin , depends on the bending stiff - ness and the strength of the electrostatic interaction . The longer is the regulatory unit ; the fewer myosin heads are needed to propel a regulated actin filament with high veloc - ity ( Shchepkin et al . 2017b ) . The length of the regulatory unit was estimated in solution ( Geeves and Lehrer 1994 ) , muscle fibre ( Regnier et al . 2002 ) , and in vitro experiments ( Desai et al . 2015 ) . It was found to be 55 – 66 nm that is longer than a Tpm molecule . An updated theory takes into account the intrinsically helical shape of the Tpm – Tn strand and gives even longer regulatory unit due to an effective strand tension caused by the helicity ( Metalnikova and Tsaturyan 2013 ) . This theory and those mentioned above treat the Tpm – Tn strand as a bar with uniform constant bending stiffness and uniform electrostatic interaction with F - actin . In reality , the N - and C - terminal parts of Tpm ( Brown et al . 2001 ; Brown 2010 ) , its mid - part ( Brown et al . 2005 ) , and the overlap junction where four α - helices of the N - and C - termini of two adjacent Tpm molecules interact by their end fragments ( Greenfield et al . 2006 ) , are not uniform and contain non - canonical resi - dues , stabilising and destabilising clusters , core gaps , stag - gers and bends which affect the shape and flexibility of the Tpm strand ( Kwok and Hodges 2004 ; Brown 2010 , 2013 ) . In the recent comprehensive review , Hitchcock - DeGregori and Barua ( 2017 ) discussed how structural variations among Tpm isoforms and along a Tpm molecule affect its shape , stability , and binding to F - actin . They found that the pres - ence of alanine clusters , bends , core gaps and other struc - tural peculiarities are essential for Tpm stability , dynamics , actin binding , and regulatory function . Dimer Tpm molecule can be either a homodimer con - sisting of α - helical chains of the same isoform or a heter - odimer with chains of different Tpm isoforms . Four TPM genes ( TPM1 , TPM2 , TPM3 , and TPM4 ) express different Tpm isoforms in mammalian tissues ( Geeves et al . 2015 ) . Products of three genes are present in contractile appara - tus of muscles : Tpm 1 . 1 and Tpm 1 . 2 ( products of TPM1 gene , α - chain ) , Tpm 2 . 2 ( product of TPM2 gene , β - chain ) and Tpm 3 . 12 ( product of TPM3 gene , γ - chain ) . Tpm 1 . 1 is the major isoform in cardiac and fast skeletal muscles , Tpm 3 . 12 is common in slow muscles , Tpm 1 . 2 is the minor iso - form found only in cardiac muscle , and Tpm 2 . 2 is widely expressed in all skeletal muscles . To date , most of the studies were carried out on homodimers . However , as the heter - odimers are present in striated muscles , they also deserve particular studies . Here we consider and discuss the mechanical and func - tional consequences of the structural heterogeneity of Tpm studied by point mutations , interchain disulphide crosslink - ing and several biophysical methods , including differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , the in vitro motility assay , the two - bead optical trap , and molecular dynamics ( MD ) . Par - ticularly , we are focused on the role of its central part and the overlap junction in the regulation of the actin – myosin interaction . Special attention is paid to the long - range effects when local changes in Tpm cause global changes in stabil - ity , mechanical and functional characteristics of distal parts of Tpm , the whole molecule or its complexes with F - actin 57 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 and Tn . Also , we discuss differences in the properties of Tpm homo - and heterodimers . All these Tpm features affect actin – myosin interaction . Tpm structure High‑resolution Tpm structure The first low - resolution crystal structure of the whole Tpm molecule was solved a long time ago ( Phillips 1986 ; Whitby and Phillips 2000 ) . Later the N - ( Brown et al . 2001 ; Rao et al . 2012 ) and C - termini ( Li et al . 2002 ; Nitanai et al . 2007 ; Minakata et al . 2008 ) , as well as mid - part of Tpm ( Brown et al . 2005 ) were solved at a higher resolution . Structures of the head - to - tail overlap junction between two Tpm molecules of different types were obtained by NMR ( Greenfield et al . 2006 , 2009 ) and X - ray crystallography ( Murakami et al . 2008 ; Frye et al . 2010 ) using the N - and C - terminal Tpm fragments fused to other proteins . Besides , acetylation of the N - terminal of Tpm in all overlap struc - tures obtained so far was mimicked . It should be mentioned that the structure of Murakami et al . ( 2008 ) is very distinct from the others and causes serious reservations as the N - and C - terminal helices loosely interact with each other . Cryo - electron microscopy provided high - resolution structures of the Tpm – actin filament and the ternary Tpm actin – myosin complexes with near - atomic details ( Behrmann et al . 2012 ; Sousa et al . 2013 ; von der Ecken et al . 2015 ) . The structure of Tpm is shown in Fig . 1 ; regions of interest discussed below are given at higher magnification . DSC as a useful approach for studying Tpm structure Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was applied by Lehrer and co - workers more than 40 years ago to investigate the thermal denaturation of Tpm ( Krishnan et al . 1978 ) . An advantage of DSC is that it allows one to decompose a heat sorption curve into separate thermal transitions ( calorimetric domains ) corresponding to the melting of different parts of the Tpm molecule ( Williams and Swenson 1981 ; Sturtevant et al . 1991 ; Potekhin and Privalov 1982 ) , and thereby to determine how different mutations or modifications affect the Tpm structure . Usually , three calorimetric domains are sufficient for the satisfactory fitting of most DSC curves . Fig . 1 Structure of α - Tpm . a Full - length α - Tpm ( PDB ID 1C1G , Whitby and Phillips 2000 ) . Destabilising clusters of three or more consecutive Ala , Ser , or charged residues are shown red ; the S36 and C190 residues which can be cross - linked by a disulphide bridge ( in case of S36 this can be done after double substitution S36C / C190A ) are shown yellow ; bulky residues M127 , I130 , M141 , Q144 are shown green ; non - canonical residues D137 and G126 are shown magenta . b A part of the Tpm coiled - coil where a destabilising clus - ter formed by the Ala74 , Ala78 , and Ala81 core residues and neigh - bouring stabilising cluster formed by hydrophobic core residues Val85 , Leu88 , Ile92 , Val95 , and Leu99 are located . c The ‘core gap’ in the Tpm coiled - coil between the M127 – I130 and M141 – Q144 core residues ( PDB ID 2B9C , Brown et al . 2005 ) . d Overlap junction between the C - and N - terminals of two Tpm molecules ( initial PDB structure ID 2G9J , Greenfield et al . 2006 ) was modified and then sub - jected to a short MD run changed as described by Matyushenko et al . ( 2018b ) . Each of the polypeptide chains is shown in a different col - our . The Figure was prepared using ICM Browser ( Molsoft CA , USA ) 58 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 These domains correspond to the N - and C - terminal parts of the molecule and a part ( s ) with reduced thermal stability . Two specific approaches were applied to assign the calo - rimetric domains on the DSC profiles to certain parts of the Tpm molecule . One was a combination of DSC studies with measurements of the temperature dependence of decrease in pyrene excimer fluorescence reflecting the separation of two Tpm chains ( i . e . , local denaturation ) near the Cys resi - dues to which the label was attached ( Ishii and Lehrer 1990 ; Nevzorov et al . 2008 ; Matyushenko et al . 2015 ) . Another approach was a formation of the disulphide bond between Cys residues of a Tpm dimer . This cross - linking was shown to increase the thermal stability of the Tpm region where Cys residues are located ( Kremneva et al . 2004 ; Matyush - enko et al . 2015 ) , and Fig . 2 illustrates how this approach was applied to identify calorimetric domains in the skeletal αα - Tpm homodimer . The formation of disulphide interchain bond between Cys190 residues increased the thermal stabil - ity of calorimetric domain 2 by shifting its thermal transition to a higher temperature , with no effect on the stability of domain 3 ( Fig . 2a ) . This indicates that calorimetric domain 2 can be assigned to the thermal unfolding of the C - terminal half of the Tpm molecule where Cys190 is located ( Fig . 1a ) . To identify the most thermostable calorimetric domain 3 on the DSC profile of Tpm ( see upper plot on Fig . 2a ) Cys190 was replaced by Ala ( mutation C190A ) , and Ser36 in the N - terminal part of the molecule was replaced by Cys ( mutation S36C , Fig . 1a ) . The results of DSC experiments clearly showed that the formation of an interchain disulphide bond between Cys36 residues considerably increased the thermal stability of calorimetric domain 3 ( Matyushenko et al . 2015 , Fig . 2b ) . Thus , the most thermostable calorimet - ric domain 3 can be assigned to the thermal unfolding of the N - terminal part of Tpm . As to the least thermostable calo - rimetric domain 1 ( Fig . 2 ) , it was assumed to correspond to the melting of the middle part of the Tpm molecule ( Maty - ushenko et al . 2015 , 2018a ) , although the domain may also correspond to other part ( s ) of the molecule with reduced thermal stability . The head - to - tail overlap junction between the N - and C - termini of neighbour Tpm molecules or other small Tpm region also may be the least thermostable part of the molecule . Judging from the enthalpy associated with calorimetric domains 2 and 3 , each of them corresponds to 40 – 45 % of the Tpm length , whereas the least thermostable domain 1 corresponds to 10 – 15 % of the molecule or 28 – 42 residues . DSC was successfully used to study the thermal unfold - ing of actin – bound Tpm ( Levitsky et al . 2000 ; Levitsky 2004 ; Kremneva et al . 2003 , 2004 , 2006 ; Mirza et al . 2007 ; Singh and Hitchcock - DeGregori 2009 ; Nevzorov et al . 2011 ) . Although Tpm binding to F - actin caused pronounced changes in the thermal unfolding of Tpm , it did not affect the thermal denaturation of phalloidin – stabilised F - actin , that is much more thermostable than Tpm .

Solid lines rep - resent the experimental curves after subtraction of instrumental and chemical baselines ; dotted lines represent the individual thermal transitions ( calorimetric domains 1 , 2 , and 3 ) . The heat - ing rate was 1 K / min 59 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 of F - actin a new , very sharp and highly cooperative peak appears on the DSC thermograms at a temperature close to that of dissociation of the Tpm – F - actin complex determined from light scattering experiments . It was therefore concluded that actin - induced changes in the thermal unfolding of Tpm are associated with the protective effect of F - actin . The new sharp peak on the DSC profile results from fast denatura - tion of all those parts of the Tpm molecule that should have denatured at lower temperatures in the absence of F - actin but have been protected from unfolding until Tpm dissociated from F - actin ( Kremneva et al . 2004 , 2006 ; Levitsky 2004 ; Mirza et al . 2007 ; Nevzorov et al . 2011 ) . Physical and chemical properties of Tpm essential for its regulatory function Tpm affinity for F‑actin The high affinity of Tpm for F - actin essential for its gating role is provided by “Gestalt - binding” ( Holmes and Lehman 2008 ) . This polysemantic term reflects natural shape com - plementarity of the segments of Tpm coiled - coil and the whole strand with the surface of F - actin . An alternative view considers the binding of Tpm to F - actin as an ‘induced fit’ in which semiflexible Tpm strand adopts the shape of F - actin helix during consecutive interaction of its charged side chains with oppositely charged residues on the actin surface ( Barua et al . 2013 ) . The form - based conception suggests that significant changes in the Tpm shape , such as extra bends or straightening of existing curvatures should decrease the shape complementarity and the affinity of Tpm for F - actin . Besides , changes in the shape of the overlap region or the head - to - tail Tpm affinity also should affect the shape of the strand or Tpm oligomerisation and cause changes in the Tpm affinity for F - actin . The ‘induced fit’ concept predicts that the Tpm affinity for F - actin is mainly determined by charged residues interacting with actin and is not much affected by other details unless Tpm becomes too stiff for adopting the actin shape . As shown below both hypotheses receive strong experimental support , although some experimental data are difficult to explain based on one or another hypothesis only . The strength of Tpm binding for actin is often estimated using cosedimentation assay ( Kominz and Maruyama 1967 ) . It should be mentioned that the results of cosedimentation experiments are determined not only by the affinity of a single Tpm molecule for F - actin but rather by the forma - tion of the Tpm strand on the surface of a thin filament and therefore the apparent Tpm affinity for F - actin strongly depends on the strength of the Tpm – Tpm bonds . A model that describes Tpm binding to F - actin with two - parameters that account for both binding of a single Tpm molecule and the Tpm – Tpm interaction was developed to fit the results of titration experiments ( Wegner 1980 ) . Bending stiffness of Tpm and Tpm – actin filaments A factor that strongly affects the regulatory properties of Tpm is its bending stiffness . According to theoretical con - siderations ( Smith et al . 2003 ; Smith and Geeves 2003 ; Metalnikova and Tsaturyan 2013 ) , it is the main determi - nant of the size of the effective regulatory unit on the thin filaments . Tpm bending stiffness was estimated from the analysis of EM images of single Tpm molecules ( Li et al . 2010a ) using an approach based on statistical mechanics of semiflexible worm - like chain previously developed for actin filaments ( Isambert et al . 1995 ) . Several factors complicate this approach : limited resolution of the EM images , intrinsically bent structure of Tpm coiled - coil that matches long actin helix while the analysis is only valid for intrinsically straight semiflexible bars , and reduced dimensionality as an EM image is a plane projection of a 3D Tpm structure . Molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation ( Lakkaraju and Hwang 2009 ; Li et al . 2010a , b ; Lehman et al . 2014 , 2018 ; Zheng et al . 2013 , 2016 ; Matyushenko et al . 2018b , 2019a ; Koubassova et al . 2019 ) is an alterna - tive way for estimation bending stiffness of Tpm in silico in the absence and in the presence of F - actin . However , the results of MD simulation depend on the details of the MD method used ( implicit or explicit solvent , force field , and method of data analysis ) . To account for the intrinsi - cally bent shape of Tpm , Li et al . ( 2010b ) introduced a “dynamic persistence length” term . It is calculated from the deviations of the Tpm shape during an MD trajec - tory from the “time - average Tpm structure” . The aver - age structure was obtained from the same MD trajectory . Another approach was suggested by Matyushenko et al . ( 2018a , b ) and Koubassova et al . ( 2019 ) who estimated the time - average deviations of the unit tangent vectors of the coiled - coil axis from their time - average directions along the Tpm molecule . Although estimations of the Tpm bending stiffness based on EM and MD are useful , direct experimental stiffness measurement is desirable . A method for measurement of the bending stiffness of the Tpm – actin or Tpm – actin – Tn thin filaments using a two - beam optical trap was initially suggested by Dupuis et al . ( 1997 ) . Later it was improved , so that changes in thin filament stiffness caused by point mutations in Tpm can be resolved ( Nabiev et al . 2015 ) . Addition of Tpm and Tn approximately doubles the bending stiffness of actin - phalloidin filaments ( Nabiev et al . 2015 ) . The bending stiffness of thin filament depends on the Tpm stiffness , the actin – Tpm interaction and the strength of the Tpm – Tpm junctions . However , as shown below the Tpm bending 60 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 stiffness and stiffness of thin filaments often although not always correlate . Non‑canonical residues in the central part of Tpm The middle part of Tpm is often assumed to be the least stable part of the molecule as was demonstrated by limited trypsinolysis ( Ueno 1984 ; Sumida et al . 2008 ; Nevzorov et al . 2011 ; Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . This part of the Tpm molecule contains two non - canonical residues that disrupt the heptad repeat characteristic for the coiled - coil structure ( Fig . 1c ) . One of them is negatively charged Asp137 residue in the d position that is typically occupied by a hydrophobic residue ( Sumida et al . 2008 ) . Another non - canonical residue nearby is Gly126 in the g position instead of a typically charged residue ( Nevzorov et al . 2011 ) . Both these residues are highly conserved , at least in all vertebrate Tpm isoforms ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) , emphasising their importance for Tpm structure and function . In particular , the peptide bond Arg133 – Ala134 located between the Asp137 and Gly126 residues was shown to be the most susceptible Tpm site for cleavage by trypsin ( Pato et al . 1981 ; Ueno 1984 ) . To clarify the role of the instability of the middle part of Tpm , these non - canonical residues were replaced by the canonical ones : Asp137 was substituted for Leu by the D137L mutation , introducing a highly preferred hydropho - bic residue into the d position ( Sumida et al . 2008 ) , and Gly126 was substituted for a charged Arg by the G126R mutation ( Nevzorov et al . 2011 ; Shchepkin et al . 2013 ) . Besides , both these mutations can be introduced into the same molecule ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) to analyse their combined action on the structural and functional proper - ties of Tpm . Stabilisation of Tpm molecule by substitutions D137L , G126R , and D137L / G126R Both the D137L and G126R substitutions strongly reduced the rate of Tpm cleavage by trypsin between Arg133 and Ala134 ( Sumida et al . 2008 ; Nevzorov et al . 2011 ) , whereas the double mutation D137L / G126R prevented the tryptic cleavage even more effectively than a single D137L or G126R mutation ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . These data demonstrate that the D137L and G126R muta - tions , and especially the double mutation D137L / G126R , stabilise the middle part of the Tpm molecule ( Nevzorov et al . 2011 ; Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . In addition , the DSC results have shown that all three substitutions stabilise not only the middle region of Tpm , where they are located but also other quite distal parts of the molecule including its N - and C - terminal domains . In particular , the peak of the 3rd calorimetric domain corresponding to the N - terminal part of the Tpm molecule ( Fig . 2a ) shifted by ~ 10 °C to an unusually high temperature of 63 . 5 °C for Tpm with dou - ble mutation G126R / D137L ( Matyushenko et al . 2015 ) . This data is consistent with the results of other studies showing long - range effects of different mutations , includ - ing D137L , on the structure and properties of Tpm mol - ecule ( Yar et al . 2013 ; Moore et al . 2011 ; Ly and Lehrer 2012 ; Mamidi et al . 2013 ) . Functional effects of stabilising Tpm substitutions D137L , G126R , and D137L / G126R The stabilising substitutions D137L , G126R , and D137L / G126R did not influence the Tpm affinity for actin ( Sumida et al . 2008 ; Nevzorov et al . 2011 ; Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . On the other hand , all these substitutions effectively shifted towards higher temperature the curve of heat - induced dis - sociation of the Tpm – F - actin complexes measured by the light scattering ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . The thermal stability of the Tpm – actin complex is rather determined by the thermal stability of the Tpm molecule than by its affinity for actin ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) . The statement comes from the data ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 , 2015 ) showing a tight correlation between the melting tem - perature of the 1st ( less thermostable ) calorimetric domain of Tpm and the temperature of Tpm dissociation from F - actin measured with light scattering . Mutations , which stabilise this part of Tpm , shift the Tpm dissociation curve toward a higher temperature . It should be mentioned that the same mutations often did not affect Tpm affinity for F - actin at room temperature measured with the cosedimentation assay ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . These data could explain why the substitutions , which stabilise the Tpm molecule , also increase the thermal stability of the Tpm – F - actin com - plex . Recent MD simulations of Tpm alone and the Tpm – F - actin complex suggested that the non - canonical Asp137 resi - due is a locus responsible for twisting and bending variance in the coiled - coil , which might have a marked effect on the actin – Tpm interaction ( Lehman et al . 2018 ) . Lehrer and co - workers ( Sumida et al . 2008 ) found that the D137L mutation causes a significant increase in the actin - activated ATPase activity of myosin heads during their interaction with regulated thin filaments at saturating Ca 2 + concentration . Later on , the in vitro motility studies showed that the stabilising substitutions significantly increase the maximum sliding velocity of regulated thin filaments at satu - rating Ca 2 + concentration and the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the velocity ( Shchepkin et al . 2013 ; Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . An increase in the velocity and its Ca 2 + sensitivity upon the D137L mutation was recently confirmed by Lehman et al . 61 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 ( 2018 ) . Such effects can be explained by an increase in the bending stiffness of the Tpm molecule revealed by MD simulation in explicit solvent ( Matyushenko et al . 2018b ) . On the other hand , Langevin MD simulation in an implicit solvent model predicted straightening of Tpm molecule upon the D137L mutation combined with its local stiffening and a global increase in flexibility ( Moore et al . 2011 ) . An increase in the bending stiffness of reconstructed Tpm – actin filaments upon the D137L or double D137L / G126R substi - tutions ( Nabiev et al . 2015 ) correlates with the results of MD simulation of Matyushenko et al . ( 2018b ) . Influence of these substitutions on the interactions between the middle part of Tpm and myosin head was also proposed ( Shchepkin et al . 2013 ; Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . However , it seems most likely that the stabilisation of the middle part of Tpm affects the filament sliding velocity and its Ca 2 + sensitivity via an increase in the bending stiffness of the Tpm strand that elon - gates the regulatory unit . In particular , it was shown that the double substitution D137L / G126R considerably decreases the concentration of myosin loaded to experimental flow cell required to propel regulated thin filaments with half - maxi - mum velocity ( Shchepkin et al . 2017b ) . Thereby , the effects of the stabilising substitutions in the middle part of Tpm on the interaction of myosin with regulated thin filaments are mainly realised via long - range cooperative mechanisms . The functional outcomes of the stabilising substitutions in the middle part of Tpm were also studied on myofibrils containing Tpm with substitutions D137L or D137L / G126R ( Scellini et al . 2017 ) and transgenic mouse model expressing cardiac Tpm with D137L mutation ( Yar et al . 2013 ) . The D137L and D137L / G126R substitution had no appreciable effect on the kinetics of myofibril activation and active force at saturating Ca 2 + concentration , but they greatly affected myofibril relaxation . The myofibrils from rabbit psoas mus - cle containing Tpm with substitutions D137L ( and espe - cially D137L / G126R ) relaxed slower than those with WT Tpm , indicating their increased Ca 2 + - sensitivity that leaves some myosin - binding sites on F - actin open even after Ca 2 + removal ( Scellini et al . 2017 ) . However , the hearts of the transgenic mice with the D137L Tpm mutation demon - strated systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to a decrease in myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity and cardiomyocyte contractil - ity leading to a phenotype similar to dilated cardiomyopathy ( Yar et al . 2013 ) . All these results indicate that the structural lability of the Tpm central part caused by the non - canonical residues is essential for the regulatory function of Tpm , although exact mechanisms are not well understood . The effects of the G126R and D137L mutations in the central part of Tpm on the properties of Tpm and its complexes with F - actin are summarised in Table 1 . Alanine clusters in Tpm and core gap in its central part Alanine clusters Tpm has a substantial number of alanine clusters , i . e . , regions where a and d positions in the several consecutive heptads are occupied by Ala residues , not larger canoni - cal hydrophobic residues like Leu or Ile ( McLachlan and Stewart 1975 , Fig . 1a ) . A combination of these clusters with neighbour coiled - coil with larger hydrophobic core residues ( Fig . 1b ) are believed to cause bends and staggers reducing Table 1 Effects of some mutation in the central part of Tpm molecule Symbols : − , no effect ; ↓ , decrease in the value ; ↑ , increase in the value ; , dramatic decrease in the value ; , dramatic increase in the value ; × , no data .

Substitution of three consecutive Ala residues in the N - terminal part of Tpm ( A74L / A78V / A81L ) for larger canonical hydrophobic residues significantly reduced the Tpm affinity for actin measured with the cosedimentation assay and shifted the high - temperature peak on the DSC profile towards higher temperature compared to WT Tpm ( Singh and Hitchcock - DeGregori 2003 ) . On the other hand , another triple Ala substitution for polar residues ( A74Q / A78N / A81Q ) restored both the Tpm affinity for actin and its thermal stability ( Singh and Hitchcock - DeGregori 2003 ) . MD simulation of full - length Tpm with the triple A74L / A78V / A81L mutation showed a change in the shape of Tpm molecule that may contribute to its affinity for actin via a gestalt binding mechanism ( Li et al . 2010a ; Lehman et al . 2018 ) . A triple mutation of another cluster of small core residues in the central part of Tpm ( A179L / A183V / S186L ) increased the thermal stability of Tpm and reduced its affin - ity for actin while a triple mutant with polar core residues A179Q / A183N / A186Q was similar to WT Tpm ( Singh and Hitchcock - DeGregori 2006 ) . These results can be consid - ered as evidence for the ‘induced fit’ concept as an over - stabilisation of the N - or C - terminal of Tpm caused by the substitutions of consecutive Ala core residues for canonical ones decreased the Tpm affinity for actin . Stabilising and destabilising clusters and core gap Kwok and Hodges ( 2004 ) have analysed the Tpm structure and found that 58 . 5 % of the residues in the a or d core posi - tions are occupied by stabilising residues ( Leu , Ile , Val , Met , Phe , and Tyr ) while the rest 41 . 5 % are occupied by destabi - lising residues ( all other residues , except Pro incompatible with α - helix ) . Further analysis of the stabilising clusters of three or more consecutive bulky non - polar residues and destabilising clusters of three or more destabilising residues revealed that the effect of substitution of a stabilising residue for Ala is context - dependent ( Kwok and Hodges 2004 ) . A core gap between two α - helical chains in the central part of Tpm revealed by Brown et al . ( 2005 ) is of particular interest . The gap is located between two pairs of large core residues Met127 – Ile130 and Met141 – Asn144 and flanked by a destabilising core cluster Ala116 – Ala120 – Ser123 and non - canonical residue Gly126 ( Fig . 1a , c ) . These large core residues between the Tpm α - helices keep them apart . As the Ala134 core residues are small and the charged side chains of neighbour core Asp137 residues are facing surrounding solvent , the cavity between the α - helices is quite large ( up to 0 . 5 nm ) and water accessible judging from crystal struc - ture and MD simulations ( Brown et al . 2005 ; Matyushenko et al . 2018b ) . In order to probe the structural and functional consequences of such unusual coiled - coil organisation , the effects of mutations M127A / I130A , M141A / Q144A , and M127A / I130A / M141A / Q144A were studied with different experimental techniques and MD simulation ( Matyushenko et al . 2018b ) . The idea was to close the core gap by the for - mation of a long alanine cluster and study the effects of the closure . In particular , a destabilisation of the central part of Tpm was expected due to the formation of a long Ala cluster . The results , however , were somewhat different from the expectation . In contrast to the G126R or D137L mutations , no global changes in the thermal stability of Tpm caused by the core gap mutations assessed were found with either DSC or CD . The core gap mutations also did not affect Tpm trypsin cleavage between Arg133 and Ala134 residues , which are located between the mutation sites , and the Tpm affinity for actin assessed with the cosedimentation assay or tempera - ture - induced dissociation of Tpm from F - actin . However , both the M127A / I130A and M141A / Q144A Tpm muta - tions strongly affected functional characteristics of Tpm increasing the sliding velocity of regulated thin filaments over myosin in the in vitro motility assay and its Ca 2 + sensi - tivity , although did not affect the force of the actin – myosin interaction . These changes in regulatory properties of Tpm caused by the mutations closing the core gap correlate with an increase in bending stiffness of the central part of Tpm estimated from MD simulation . The absence of any changes in trypsin cleavage upon core gap mutations also correlates with the results of MD simulation . Unlike the D137L muta - tion that protected Tpm from trypsinolysis , the core gap mutations did not increase the occupancy of the backbone H - bonds in the region of Tpm residues 133 – 137 compared to WT Tpm ( Matyushenko et al . 2018b ) . The data suggest that a closure of the core gap did not increase the thermal stability of the Tpm molecule , although possibly increased its mechanical stiffness and enhanced the cooperativity of the regulation of the actin – myosin interaction . The effects of the core gap mutations on the properties of Tpm and its complexes with F - actin are summarised in Table 1 . Interchain disulphide cross‑linking of Tpm In all striated muscles the SH - , or thiol , groups of Cys190 ( Fig . 1a ) residues in each of two α - helical chains of Tpm molecule usually are reduced ( Lehrer et al . 2011a , b ) . Since the chains of the dimeric Tpm molecule are in register , under oxidising conditions , these residues may cross - link forming an interchain disulphide bond ( Lehrer 1975 ) . Such a cross - linking was shown to take place upon experimental myo - cardial dysfunction caused by coronary microembolization ( Canton et al . 2006 ) or surgically induced myocardial infarc - tion ( Avner et al . 2012 ) and was found in patients with the 63 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 end - stage heart failure ( Canton et al . 2011 ) . For the experi - mental purpose , the cross - linked Tpm can be obtained by its treatment with DTNB ( Lehrer 1975 ) . The cross - linking of the Cys190 residues causes signifi - cant changes in physico - chemical properties of the Tpm molecule . Using CD and DSC Lehrer et al . ( Lehrer 1978 ; Krishnan et al . 1978 ) have shown that the interchain disul - phide cross - linking of Cys190 significantly increases the stability of the Tpm structure against thermal denaturation , but at the same time it causes a destabilizing ‘pre - transition’ at a temperature range of 30 – 45 °C involving up to 20 % of the Tpm α - helices . This ‘pre - transition’ was identified as the thermal unfolding of the least stable region in the middle part of Tpm ( Lehrer 1978 ) . In DSC experiments a ‘pre - transition’ melting peak at 25 – 40 °C and a considerable shift in the major thermal transition from 45 to 59 °C were discovered ( Krishnan et al . 1978 ; Williams and Swenson 1981 , Fig . 2a ) . Further DSC studies have shown that this cross - linking stabilises the C - terminal half of the Tpm mol - ecule but does not affect its N - terminal part ( Williams and Swenson 1981 ; Kremneva et al . 2004 ; Matyushenko et al . 2015 ) . Effect of the cross - linking on the thermal stability of Tpm was also confirmed by its tryptic cleavage : at 26 °C the cross - linking did not affect the cleavage of Tpm at Arg133 residue but slightly accelerated it at 40 °C ( Yampolsky et al . 2011 ) . Thus , it seems that the cross - linking simultaneously stabilises C - terminal half of Tpm but destabilises the central segment in the vicinity of the trypsin cleavage site located 47 residues apart from Cys190 . The structural changes introduced by the disulphide cross - linking have a considerable influence on the Tpm functional properties , such as the Tpm affinity for actin measured with the cosedimentation assay ( Walsh and Weg - ner 1980 ; Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) , the thermal stability of Tpm – F - actin complex ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) , and the calcium regulation of the actin – myosin interaction ( Maty - ushenko et al . 2017 ) . Results of the cosedimentation assay ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) and the light scattering ( Walsh and Wegner 1980 ) have shown that the formation of the interchain bonds reduces the affinity of Tpm for F - actin esti - mated with the cosedimentation assay . The stability of the complexes formed by cross - linked and reduced Tpm with F - actin was tested by measuring the thermal dependence of the light scattering . The Tpm cross - linking destabilised the Tpm – F - actin complex markedly ( by 4 . 4 °C ) decreasing the dissociation temperature compared to the reduced Tpm ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) that is in a good agreement with the decreased Tpm affinity for actin . Williams and Swen - son ( 1982 ) showed that in skeletal muscle assay , the cross - linking of Tpm did not affect the actomyosin ATPase in the presence of Tn . The influence of the Tpm disulphide cross - linking on functional characteristics of the actin – myosin interaction has been studied in the in vitro motility assay ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) . In the absence of Ca 2 + and Tn , the Tpm cross - linking did not affect the sliding velocity of the Tpm – actin filaments . The effect of the Tpm cross - linking on the p Ca - velocity relationship measured in the in vitro motility experi - ments with regulated thin filaments depended on the iso - forms of myosin and Tn used . Generally , the cross - linking increased the maximal sliding velocity of thin filaments compared with reduced Tpm : by 20 % with skeletal Tn over fast skeletal myosin ; by 30 % with cardiac Tn over fast skel - etal myosin ; and by 100 % with cardiac Tn over ventricular myosin ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) . The Tpm cross - linking , however , did not affect the sliding velocity of the filaments with cardiac Tn over atrial myosin ( Shchepkin et al . 2019 ) . In any protein combination , the Tpm cross - linking had no appreciable influence on the Ca 2 + - sensitivity of the sliding velocity of thin filaments . One can assume that the interchain cross - linking may affect the mechanical properties of the Tpm molecule . Indeed , measurements of bending stiffness of thin filaments with the optical trap technique showed that the filaments containing cross - linked Tpm are 1 . 4 - fold stiffer than those with reduced Tpm ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) . It was shown theoretically ( Smith et al . 2003 ; Smith and Geeves 2003 ; Metalnikova and Tsaturyan 2013 ) that the bending stiffness of the Tpm strand may be a substantial parameter in the thin filament activation , namely in the propagation of the mechanical wave of activation along the filament . Increased stiffness of the Tpm strand promotes further distribution of its shift over F - actin surface upon binding of Ca 2 + to Tn or a myosin head to F - actin . Thus , more myosin binding sites on F - actin become accessible and more myosin heads pull the thin filament increasing its sliding velocity . It should be noted that in the in vitro motility assay where unavoidably internal load is present ( Haeberle and Hemric 1995 ) , the filament velocity is a function of pulling force , i . e . , the more myosin heads are involved in the interaction with the filament the easier they overcome the internal load . Therefore , the increased stiffness facilitates cooperative mechanisms of Ca 2 + regulation of the actin – myosin inter - action . In other words , an increase in the maximal sliding velocity with cross - linked , i . e . , more stiff Tpm , in terms of the steric - blocking model ( McKillop and Geeves 1993 ; Lehman and Craig 2008 ) can be explained by a shift in the Ca 2 + - independent equilibrium between the ‘closed’ and ‘open’ states of the thin filament in favour of the latter state . A similar correspondence between the stiffness and the slid - ing velocity was found earlier with stabilising mutations in the central part of the Tpm molecule ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ; Nabiev et al . 2015 ) . To understand the possible molecular mechanisms underlying changes in structural and functional properties of Tpm caused by the interchain cross - linking , molecular 64 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 dynamics ( MD ) simulations of the central part of the Tpm in both cross - linked and unlinked states were performed ( Koubassova et al . 2019 ) . As was assessed from MD tra - jectories , the cross - linking increased the bending stiffness of the central part of Tpm at 27 °C that correlates with experimental measurement of the bending stiffness of thin filaments . However , at 40 °C , the simulations showed that the cross - linking caused a more pronounced decrease in the Tpm stiffness than at lower temperature and a significant reduction in the number of main chain H - bonds in the vicin - ity of residues R133 and A134 compared to other parts of the molecule . These data are in line with observations show - ing a decreased thermal stability of the least stable part of Tpm ( Lehrer 1975 ; calorimetric domain 1 in Fig . 2a ) and accelerated trypsin cleavage at residue R133 at 40 °C upon cross - linking ( Yampolsky et al . 2011 ) . The most critical changes in the contractile function caused by the Tpm cross - linking occur in cardiac muscle , and this can explain why the cross - linking is associated with such pathologies as myocardial dysfunction in con - sequence of coronary microembolization and human end - stage heart failure ( Canton et al . 2006 , 2011 ) . Structural and functional changes induced by the interchain cross - linking allows speculating on its role in the development of heart diseases . The reduction in the Tpm affinity for F - actin and the stability of the Tpm – F - actin complex may contribute to the heart failure pathogenesis by breaking the sarcomere structure and decreasing myocardial contractility . Canton et al . ( 2011 ) found a direct correlation between the amounts of cross - linked Tpm and cardiac TnI in plasma , indicating a heart failure , and a contractile impairment of the left ventri - cle . Myocytes from a remote zone of myocardial infarction were shown to have cross - linked Tpm , and their contractil - ity was enhanced ( Avner et al . 2012 ; Venkataraman et al . 2013 ) . This increase in contractility can be explained by the in vitro motility data which show that cross - linked Tpm accelerates the sliding of thin filaments ( Matyushenko et al . 2017 ) although effect ( s ) of post - translational modifications in other sarcomere proteins cannot be excluded . Overlap junction The overlap junction between the N - and C - termini of neigh - bour Tpm molecules ( Fig . 1d ) plays a crucial role in the formation of semirigid Tpm strand winding around an actin filament . This junction should be stiff enough to transmit azimuthal Tpm movement relative to the filament axis to neighbour Tpm molecules to regulate a substantial number of actin sites with high cooperativity . Besides , the junction should provide a high affinity of the Tpm strand for F - actin . The affinity is low at low Tpm level and increases upon an increase in Tpm concentration ( Hill et al . 1992 ) indicating that the formation of Tpm oligomers promotes their bind - ing to F - actin or the Tpm affinity for F - actin is substantially increased when the neighbour actin sites are already occu - pied by another Tpm molecule . To provide the complemen - tarity of Tpm and F - actin , the Tpm strand should have a shape of long F - actin helix , and neighbour Tpm molecule should have specific interaction sites for each of actin mono - mers they contact . The structures of the overlap junction of muscle Tpm obtained by NMR ( Greenfield et al . 2006 , 2009 ) and X - ray diffraction ( Frye et al . 2010 ) are similar to each other and show a tight packing of four near parallel α - helices stabilised by H - bonds and salt bridges . The bend of the coiled - coil over the junction axis is rather small while the planes of the N - and C - terminal coiled - coils are rotated by ~ 90° relative to each other . Quite a different structure where one of the N - terminal α - helices does not interact with the C - terminal of another Tpm molecule was also published ( Murakami et al . 2008 ) . MD simulations ( Li et al . 2014 ; Matyushenko et al . 2019a ) have shown that the bending stiffness of the junction is close to that of the rest of the Tpm molecule . Both MD simulation and EM studies suggest that pseudo - phospho - rylation of the Ser283 C - terminal residue , i . e . , the S283D substitution , increases the bending stiffness of the junction ( Lehman et al . 2015 ) . A similar increase in bending stiffness of thin filaments reinforced by S283D Tpm was obtained in the optical trap measurements ( Shchepkin et al . 2017a ) . A natural ( or rather ‘pathological’ ) approach for under - standing the structural and functional peculiarities of the junction was used by Matyushenko et al . ( 2019a ) who stud - ied effects of cardiomyopathy - associated mutations in the N - and C - terminal residues of Tpm ( M8R , K15N , A277V ) related to dilated cardiomyopathy . The A277V mutation caused a shift in the melting point of the 1st and 2nd calo - rimetric domains ( Fig . 2 ) that are believed to correspond to the middle and the C - terminal parts of the Tpm molecule , respectively ( Matyushenko et al . 2019a ) . Although neither M8R nor K15N mutations caused a significant change in the characteristics of the calorimetric domain revealed by DSC , each of them led to a dramatic reduction in viscosity of Tpm solution compared to WT Tpm . This means that both N - ter - minal mutations decrease the affinity of N - and C - termini of Tpm hampering the formation of the Tpm strand . The reduction in viscosity can be explained by a reduction in the average number of H - bonds between the N - and C - termini of Tpm caused by these mutations as was revealed by MD simulation ( Matyushenko et al . 2019a ) . A disturbance in the formation of competent Tpm strands with the M8R or K15N mutants and a decrease in the Tpm affinity for F - actin esti - mated with cosedimentation assay caused by the N - terminal mutations was manifested by the absence of a Tpm effect on the sliding velocity of F - actin in the in vitro motility assay . 65 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 The bending stiffness of the filaments formed by F - actin and each of two Tpm mutants also did not differ significantly from that of pure F - actin , while WT Tpm almost doubled it ( Nabiev et al . 2015 ; Matyushenko et al . 2019a ) . The data demonstrate that the formation of the tight overlap junc - tion between neighbour Tpm molecules is essential for Tpm function . Structural and functional properties of Tpm isoforms Most of our review was devoted to Tpm 1 . 1 isoform of Tpm , the most widespread isoform in muscles and the most studied to date . However , other isoforms are also present in different striated muscles . Tpm is a dimer molecule that can be either a homodimer consisting of chains of the same isoform or a heterodimer with chains of different isoforms . Excluding the minor Tpm 1 . 2 and Tpm 4 ( δ - Tpm ) , three major muscle isoforms can form six Tpm dimers : the αα , ββ , γγ homodimers and αβ , αγ , γβ heterodimers . From these six , only four dimers are present in muscles in substantial quantities ( αα , γγ , αβ , γβ ) . The ββ - homodimer had low sta - bility and was found only in some specific muscles ( Lehrer and Joseph 1987 ) . The αγ - heterodimer is unlikely to present in any muscle because the α and γ Tpm isoforms are pre - dominantly expressed in distinct muscles . The α - chain is expressed in fast skeletal muscles when γ chain is believed to be expressed only in slow - twitch skeletal muscles ( Perry 2001 ; Kee and Hardeman 2008 ; Jin et al . 2016 ; Oe et al . 2016 ) . Properties of muscle isoforms of Tpm Isoforms of striated muscle Tpm are highly conserved . Variations in the amino acid sequence between the iso - forms are minimal . All Tpm isoforms have the same set of variable exons , except Tpm 1 . 2 that has a 2a exon instead of 2b ( Geeves et al . 2015 ) . The sequence is determined by gene variations but not alternatively spliced exons . Tpm 1 . 1 ( α - Tpm ) and Tpm 3 . 12 ( γ - Tpm ) differ by only 21 amino acid substitutions , and Tpm 1 . 1 and Tpm 2 . 2 ( β - Tpm ) differ by about 40 substitutions ( Matyushenko et al . 2018a ) . Highly conserved Tpm structure indicates the significance of the amino acid sequence of Tpm iso - forms for their function and the substitutions may affect the Tpm stability and interactions with partner proteins . The ββ - homodimer is the less stable Tpm isoform , which is virtually absent in muscles ( Lehrer and Joseph 1987 ) but can be readily formed in vitro . The properties of the ββ - Tpm differ from those of αα - Tpm . It has a higher affinity to F - actin ( Kalyva et al . 2012 ) and being a part of the thin filament changes the Ca 2 + - sensitivity of the actin - myosin interaction compared with αα - Tpm ( Bous - souf et al . 2007 ; Bershitsky et al . 2019 ) . Tpm 3 . 12 remains the least studied isoform . Little is known about its F - actin affinity ( Akkari et al . 2002 ) . The Ca 2 + - dependence of the ATPase activity of myosin subfragment 1 ( S1 ) and Tpm position on the actin surface in different stages of myo - sin cycle were reported for this isoform ( Borovikov et al . 2018 ) . All works mentioned above were carried out on Tpm homodimer . As for the heterodimers , their investigation is of apparent interest , but until recently , it was complicated by the absence of methods of obtaining them . Studying of heterodimers became feasible since the work by Kalyva et al . ( 2012 ) , who developed a method of separation and purifica - tion of the Tpm dimers with tag molecules located in the N - terminal of the Tpm molecule . That method allowed them for the first time to compare properties of the αβ - heterodimer with those of the α - and β - homodimers . They found that αβ - heterodimer is more thermostable than ββ - Tpm and less thermostable than αα - Tpm in oxidised ( cross - linked ) state . In the reduced conditions , αβ - Tpm was less stable than ββ - Tpm below 40 °C and more stable above this tempera - ture . The affinity of αβ - Tpm for F - actin was lower than that for αα - Tpm and ββ - Tpm . Later , similar data were obtained by Bershitsky et al . ( 2019 ) . Additionally , in that last work , the stability of the Tpm – F - actin complex and the regulatory function of Tpm in the in vitro motility assay were estimated . Both of these characteristics of αβ - heterodimer were intermediate between those of the two homodimers . The stability of dif - ferent Tpm dimers was compared by DSC , which showed that the stability of Tpm dimers is ranged as follows : γγ > γβ > αα > αβ > ββ ( Matyushenko et al . 2018a ) . Interest - ingly , the Tpm stability correlates with the characteristics of Ca 2 + - dependent movement of thin filaments containing these Tpm dimers over myosin in the in vitro motility assay ( Ber - shitsky et al . 2019 ) . The range of the maximal sliding veloci - ties and the Ca 2 + - sensitivity is as follows : αα > αβ > ββ . Note that a correlation between the sliding velocity of thin fila - ments with different Tpms and their bending stiffness was observed ( Nabiev et al . 2015 ; Shchepkin et al . 2017b ) . One can assume that different Tpm isoforms may also affect the stiffness of thin filaments and thus modulate the actin – myo - sin interaction in different types of muscles . The DSC studies of different types of Tpm dimers showed differences in their enthalpy ( Matyushenko et al . 2018a ) . The enthalpy of the γγ and αα Tpm homodimers was simi - lar , about 1000 kJ / mol , while enthalpy of the αβ , ββ , and γβ Ttpm dimers was two - fold lower . This fact is of particular interest because the formation of skeletal Tpm heterodimers is thermodynamically unfavourable ( Kalyva et al . 2012 ) . An idea that the formation of the Tpm heterodimers may involve chaperones , and heterodimers can be stabilised by 66 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 55 – 70 1 3 their interaction with F - actin was put forward to explain this collision ( Janco et al . 2013 ) . This idea , however , requires experimental confirmations . Point mutations in different Tpm dimers The variety in the dimer structure of Tpm complicates study - ing of the effects of myopathic mutations in the Tpm genes as a mutation can be either in one or both chains of homo - or heterodimers . As mentioned above , any change in amino acid sequence can affect the entire structure of the molecule . Therefore , a study of the effects of point mutations is of particular interest . The first work devoted to the comparison of the properties of Tpm with mutations in one chain or two chains simulta - neously was published by Janco et al . ( 2012 ) . In that paper , properties of the Tpm dimers carrying well - studied D175N and E180G mutations were investigated . The authors found that the properties of homodimers with mutations in one or both chains are different . Similar studies were performed recently on the αβ - heterodimer with myopathic mutations in the β - chain ( Bershitsky et al . 2019 ; Matyushenko et al . 2019b ) . The significance of these works is that all previous studies of myopathic mutations in the Tpm β - chain were carried out on ββ - homodimer , which is easier expressed but virtually does not exist in mammalian muscles . The proper - ties of αβ - Tpm heterodimer and ββ - homodimer with myo - pathic mutations R133W , N202K , Q147P , and K49del in the β - chain were compared ( Marttila et al . 2012 ; Marston et al . 2013 ; Karpicheva et al . 2016 ; Bershitsky et al . 2019 ; Maty - ushenko et al . 2019b ) . All obtained results were summa - rised in Table 2 . The results showed significant differences in dynamic and functional properties of homo - and heterodi - mers from each other . Some mutations altered Tpm structure and its affinity for actin only in the case of heterodimers ( R133W and N202K ) . All mutations studied have different effects on the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the myosin – actin inter - action or velocity of thin filaments in the in vitro motility assay depending on hetero - or homo - dimeric structure of Tpm . These data indicate that the αβ - heterodimer model is more appropriate for studying the effects of the myopathic mutations . Investigation of the effects of stabilising muta - tions D137L and G126R in the α - chain on the properties of αβ - heterodimers and αα - homodimers also showed sig - nificant differences in their structural characteristics and the effect on the sliding velocity of regulated thin filaments ( Matyushenko et al . 2016 ; Nabiev et al . 2018 ) . For exam - ple , mutations D137L and D137L / G126R in the α - chain sig - nificantly decreased the maximum sliding velocity of the filaments containing αβ - heterodimers of Tpm in the in vitro motility assay ( Matyushenko et al . 2016 ) although these mutations in both α - chains of Tpm αα - homodimers strongly increased the velocity ( Matyushenko et al . 2014 ) . The results demonstrate significant structural and functional differences in Tpm homo - and heterodimers , which are probably neces - sary for fine - tuning of the regulation of the performance of various types of muscles . Conclusions The Tpm strand regulates muscle contraction by mov - ing over the surface of F - actin to open or close actin sites for myosin binding .
