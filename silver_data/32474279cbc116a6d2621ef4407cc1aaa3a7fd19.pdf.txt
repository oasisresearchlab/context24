ONCOLOGY REPORTS 31 : 745 - 754 , 2014 Abstract . NEK2 [ NIMA ( never in mitosis gene A ) - related expressed kinase 2 ] is associated with various biological behav - iors in the development of cancer , while research concerning its association with drug resistance is limited . The association of NEK2 with drug resistance in ovarian cancer has not yet been reported . In the present study , on the basis of microarray results from Oncomine and the GEO Profiles online database , we revealed that NEK2 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer tissues is upregulated . In addition , its expression in drug - resistant ovarian cancer cells was upregulated when compared with expression with their sensitive or parental counterparts . Finally , we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis consisting of protein / gene - protein / gene interaction network , annotation of biological processes and microRNA - mRNA interaction analysis . We observed that NEK2 directly or indi - rectly interacts with a number of genes , proteins , microRNAs and biological processes associated with drug resistance in ovarian and other types of cancer . These results indicate that NEK2 contributes to drug resistance in ovarian cancer and it may be an important therapeutic target . Introduction Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among malig - nancies of the female reproductive system , with a high rate of mortality worldwide . Early - stage ovarian cancer is frequently asymptomatic and difficult to detect ; thus , most patients are in advanced stages [ International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ( FIGO ) stage III and IV ] at the time of initial diag - nosis ( 1 ) , and 5 - year survival rates are less than 40 % with only modestly improved survival noted over the past 40 years ( 2 ) . The current therapy for ovarian cancer is debulking surgery followed by cisplatin - centered chemotherapy ( 3 ) . Although cisplatin - centered chemotherapy achieves a complete response rate of 40 to 60 % in advanced ovarian cancer patients ( 4 ) , long - term survival remains poor as a result of recurrence and emergence of drug resistance that finally leads to fatal disease ( 5 ) . Drug resistance , both intrinsic and acquired , results from a variety of factors including individual variations in patients and somatic cell genetic differences in tumors ( 6 ) . A number of factors such as decreased cell - associated drugs , altered drug inactivation , increased DNA damage tolerance / repair , increased anti - apoptotic regulator activity and growth factor receptor deregulation are considered to be responsible for drug resistance in ovarian cancer ( 7 , 8 ) . However , regardless of the mechanisms , abnormal expression of drug resistance - related genes often plays an important role in drug resistance . And among all of these drug resistance - related genes , oncogenes are clearly the key players . Oncogenes refer to genes whose activation can contribute to the development of cancer ( 9 ) and many are involved in drug resistance in varied types of cancers . For example , the overexpression and activation of the c - myc oncogene is associ - ated with drug resistance in small cell lung carcinoma ( 10 ) ; the LRF oncogene is a survival factor in chondrosarcoma and contributes to tumor malignancy and drug resistance ( 11 ) and the STAT3 oncogene is a predictive marker of drug resistance in cancer ( 12 ) . In ovarian cancer , a total of 13 oncogenes including CCNE1 , PIK3CA , RAB25 , MYC , PRKC1 , FGF1 , NOTCH3 , PIK3R1 , AKT2 , EGFR , ERBB2 , KRAS and AURKA are associated with cancer development ( 13 ) , and several genes such as KRAS ( 14 ) , ERBB2 ( 15 ) , PIK3CA ( 16 , 17 ) and PIK3R1 ( 18 ) are involved in drug resistance . NEK2 [ NIMA ( never in mitosis gene A ) - related expressed kinase 2 ] , a serine / threonine centrosomal kinase , is highly expressed and activated during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle ( 19 ) . NEK2 has emerged as an important oncogene due to its regulatory role in mitosis ( 20 ) . NEK2 has been proven to play pivotal roles in the development of several types of cancers , while its relationship with ovarian cancer is rare .

However , despite these study , the research on NEK2 in regards to drug resistance in cancers is still limited , and its relationship with drug resistance in ovarian cancer has never been reported . In the present study , on the basis of a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis , for the first time , we report that NEK2 may contribute to drug resistance in ovarian cancer . Materials and methods The target gene , NEK2 , which is closely associated with drug resistance in multiple myeloma ( 21 , 22 ) was selected for bioin - formatic analysis . Databases . The microarray data of NEK2 in ovarian cancer tissues was retrieved from the Oncomine online database ( https : / / www . oncomine . org / resource / main . html ) ; the micro - array data of NEK2 in ovarian cancer cells was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geoprofiles / ) ( 23 ) . The protein / gene - protein / gene interaction network was generated using the GeneMANIA online tool ( http : / / www . genemania . org / ) ( 24 ) ; annotation of biological processes was performed using the COREMINE online tool ( http : / / www . coremine . com / medical / ) ( 25 ) . The microRNAs ( miRNAs ) targeted to the gene were predicted by miRWalk online tool which included 7 prediction tools ( DIANAmT , miRanda , miRDB , miRWalk , RNAhybrid , PICTAR5 , Targetscan ) ( http : / / www . umm . uni - heidelberg . de / apps / zmf / mirwalk / ) ( 26 ) . NEK2 expression in ovarian cancer cells retrieved from the GEO database was normalized . Unpaired , two - tailed t - test assuming homogeneity of the variances was performed with Excel software . Results Function of NEK2 in cancers . Genetic screening for cell division cycle mutants in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the discovery of never in mitosis A ( NIMA ) , a serine / threonine kinase that is essential for mitotic entry . Since then , NIMA - related kinases ( NEKs ) have been identified in most eukaryotes , including humans in which 11 genetically distinct proteins named NEK1 to NEK11 have been discovered ( 27 ) . The NEKs play crucial roles in several aspects of mitotic progression , such as chromatin condensation , nuclear envelope breakdown , spindle assembly checkpoint signaling and cytokinesis . Of the human NEKs , NEK2 is the most closely related to Aspergillus NIMA and is the first NEK which has been relatively well studied ( 27 ) . Similar to NIMA , NEK2 is a cell cycle regulated kinase , with a peak of expression and activity in the S and G2 phase of the cell cycle , and it is a core component of the human centro - some ( 28 , 29 ) . NEK2 also contributes to the establishment of the microtubule - based mitotic spindle ( 27 ) . It has been proven that the NEK2 protein is elevated 2 - to 5 - fold in cell lines derived from a wide range of human tumors including those of cervical , ovarian , breast , prostate and leukemic origin ( 30 ) , suggesting its potential roles in cancer development . The role of NEK2 in breast cancer has been extensively studied . In various human breast cancer cell lines , suppression of NEK2 was found to induce aneuploidy and cell cycle arrest resulting in cell death . Significantly , the breast cancer cell line which was most sensitive to NEK2 depletion was of the triple negative breast cancer subtype . These results indicate that NEK2 plays crucial roles in breast cancer growth at primary and secondary sites ( 31 ) . Similarly , Wang et al ( 32 ) indicated that the abnormal expression of NEK2 and β - catenin may be one of the mechanisms for tumorigenesis , particularly for abnormal tumor proliferation , and the cytoplasmic expression of NEK2 is associated with both tumor grade and tumor size . These results suggest that NEK2 and β - catenin may represent new potential targets for therapeutic intervention . Moreover , a study indicated that the genetic polymorphisms of NEK2 are related to breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han women ( 33 ) . In addition , the NEK2C , which is a splice variant of NEK2 , which was found to have significantly upregulated expression in breast cancer cell lines as well as in human primary breast cancer tissue , plays a crucial role in breast cancer development and NEK2C inhibition may be a useful therapeutic target for human breast tumors ( 34 ) . In addition to the important roles in breast cancer , NEK2 also plays a role in other types of cancer . For instance , NEK2 is shown to be involved in the development of lung cancer induced by smoking and affects patient survival ( 35 ) . In cervical cancer , NEK2 was induced in 102 cancer biopsies when compared with 24 normal controls , indicating its poten - tial roles in cervical cancer ( 36 ) . The role of NEK2 in ovarian cancer is less understood . Limited studies indicate that NEK2 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells ( 30 ) and its expression is regulated by NR2F2 which is associated with a significantly shorter disease - free interval ( 37 ) , yet no further research has been reported . Likewise , the relationship between NEK2 and drug resis - tance is unclear , with only several studies indicating its drug resistance - related functions . The combined use of both NEK2 siRNA and cisplatin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in vitro , suggesting that NEK2 may be associated with drug resistance in colorectal cancer ( 38 ) . Similarly , the combination of NEK2 siRNA with paclitaxel and doxorubicin was found to improve the sensitivity of breast cancer cells during chemotherapy treatment ( 20 ) . More recently , two studies strongly support the idea that NEK2 contributes to drug resistance in cancers . Zhou et al ( 21 ) and Harrison ( 22 ) revealed that high expression of NEK2 induced drug resistance mainly through activation of efflux pumps and it may be a strong predictor of drug resistance and poor prognosis in multiple myeloma and other types of cancers . Taken together , NEK2 , an oncogene , plays crucial roles in the development of various types of cancers , but related studies in ovarian cancer are rare . In addition , although several studies have revealed the drug resistance - related functions of NEK2 in several cancers , studies in this area are limited and its association with drug resistance in ovarian cancer has never been reported . Expression of NEK2 in ovarian cancer and drug - resistant cells . NEK2 is considered as an oncogene and is overexpressed in various tumors . Thus , as an oncogene , NEK2 should be ONCOLOGY REPORTS 31 : 745 - 754 , 2014 747 overexpressed in ovarian cancer when compared to the normal control and should be upregulated in drug - resistant cells when compared to sensitive cells . Based on microarray data retrieved from the Oncomine online database , we revealed that among 4 independent microarray analyses which covered a total of 759 ovarian cancer tissues and 26 normal controls , NEK2 was overexpressed 1 . 687 - to 5 . 754 - fold in ovarian cancer tissues when compared with the normal controls ( Fig . 1A ) . Regarding two microarray data sets from the GEO Profiles database , NEK2 was found to be elevated 1 . 5 - to 1 . 7 - fold in cisplatin - resistant A2780 ovarian cancer cells when compared with the sensitive counterparts ( Fig . 1B ) . These results suggest that NEK2 may be involved in the development of ovarian cancer , including the regulation of drug resistance . Functional prediction and analysis based on protein / gene - protein / gene interaction . The protein / gene interac - tion of NEK2 with other proteins / genes was analyzed using GeneMANIA online tool . As shown in Fig . 2 , NEK2 has direct interactions with 8 proteins / genes . Among these , NEK2 was co - expressed with RAD51 , BRCA2 , PTEN and DAPK1 , was co - expressed and had genetic interaction with BRCA1 , was co - expressed and shared protein domains with CDK2 , shared protein domains with CHEK2 and had genetic inter - actions with NOM1 . With the exception of NOM1 , the other 7 proteins / genes are all associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer . BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are critically important for the repair of double - strand breaks ( DSB ) by homologous recombination ( HR ) ( 39 ) . They cooperate in DNA damage responses in a PALB2 - dependent manner and have important implications for the genesis of ovarian cancer and for chemo - therapy with DNA interstrand cross - linking agents ( 40 ) . The mRNA expression of BRCA1 has a negative correlation with the clinical sensitivity of platinum - based chemotherapy ( 41 ) . In addition , BRCA1 is positively correlated with MDR1 which is significantly involved in drug resistance and disease progres - sion ( 42 ) . In regards to BRCA2 , previous research indicates that the functional restoration of BRCA2 due to a secondary BRCA2 mutation is involved in acquired drug resistance of BRCA2 - mutated ovarian carcinomas ( 43 ) . These results implicate the important role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in drug resistance in ovarian cancer . Rad51 functionally interacts with BRCA1 in the meiotic and mitotic cell cycles ( 44 ) , and , on the basis of an interaction network ( Fig . 2 ) , Rad51 co - expressed , physically interacted and shared pathways with BRCA1 , and co - expressed , and shared pathways with BRCA2 . These results indicate that Rad51 which is closely associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 may also have drug resistance - related functions in ovarian cancer . The PTEN tumor - suppressor is a central negative regulator of the PI3K / AKT signaling cascade and suppresses cell survival as well as cell proliferation . It is found to be either inactivated or mutated in various human malignancies . Previously studies suggest that PTEN may be involved in drug resistance via the PI3K / AKT pathway and the p53 - mediated apoptotic cascade . Reduction in PTEN expres - sion was found to result in the development of drug resistance in OVCAR - 3 cells and the alterations conferred resistance to cisplatin through the activation of PI3K / Akt and the inhibi - tion of Bax translocation ( 17 ) . Further research indicates that overexpression of PTEN reverses chemoresistance to cisplatin in human ovarian cancer cells through inactivation of the Figure 1 .

LIU et al : NEK2 IN OVARIAN CANCER 748 PI3K / AKT cell survival pathway and may serve as a potential molecular target for the treatment of chemoresistant ovarian cancer ( 45 ) . Moreover , overexpression of PTEN upregulates p53 content and increases the sensitivity of chemoresistant cells to cisplatin - induced apoptosis without detectable changes in the levels of phosphorylated Akt , suggesting that PTEN may be involved in drug resistance through a p53 - mediated apoptotic cascade independent of the PI3K / Akt pathway ( 46 ) . CHEK2 is one of the critical kinases governing cell apoptosis , cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage repair . In ovarian cancer cells , CHEK2 is degraded at the protein level in response to cisplatin through the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway , suggesting that degradation or decreased expression of CHEK2 is partially responsible for chemoresistance ( 47 ) . The expression of DAPK1 and DAPK2 is altered in multi - drug - resistant gastric cancer cell lines and thus these genes may be an integral part of the mechanisms responsible for chemoresistance ( 48 ) . In ovarian cancer , DAPK1 has direct interactions with FBXO32 , PDCD4 , PTEN , TP53 and TP73 , and has indirect interactions with BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDKN1A , IL24 , MLH1 and SULF1 , which are all involved in drug resistance in ovarian cancer , suggesting its potential role in drug resistance in ovarian cancer ( 49 ) . As for CDK2 , a previous study revealed that cisplatin consistently induces transient S - phase arrest by inhibiting the CDK2 / cyclin A complex in the S - phase at 12 h after treatment with cisplatin or DAP in combination with the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole and also potently inhibits G1 - phase CDK2 / cyclin E activities at 18 h ( 50 ) , indicating that CDK2 can directly respond to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells . In addition to those with direct interactions with NEK2 , there were other proteins / genes in the network which indirectly interacted with NEK2 ( Fig . 2 ) . Among those , MLH1 ( 51 , 52 ) , PDCD4 ( 53 ) , TP53 ( 54 ) , TP73 ( 55 ) , WWOX ( 56 ) , CDKN1A ( 57 ) , PLAGL1 , PYCARD , APC and TP63 ( 49 ) , PALB2 ( 40 ) , ABCC3 ( 58 ) and PMS2 ( 59 ) are associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer . Collectively , based on the protein / gene interaction network analysis , 8 proteins / genes were identified which directly interact with NEK2 , and 7 of them were found to contribute to drug resistance in ovarian cancer ; 24 proteins / genes were found to indirectly interact with NEK2 and 13 of them were found to be associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer . These results indicate a potential role of NEK2 in drug resis - tance in ovarian cancer . Functional annotation of NEK2 with its interacting proteins / genes was performed to further reveal the relation - ship of NEK2 with drug resistance . As shown in Table I , the main functions of NEK2 with its interacting proteins / genes are cell cycle - related and microtubule - related functions , which were both proven to be associated with drug resis - tance in ovarian and other cancer types . Cell cycle - mediated drug resistance is best described as a relative insensitivity to a chemotherapeutic agent because of the position of the cells in the cell cycle . The cell cycle is closely involved in the chemosensitivity to combination chemotherapy , and the chemotherapeutic agents correlated with cell cycle events include taxanes , platinum , camptothecin and fluorouracil ( 60 ) . It has been proven that the cell cycle is closely associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer . Integration of DNA methylation and gene expression reveals specific platinum resistance - related signaling pathways in ovarian cancer , which include cell growth - promoting pathways , PI3K / Akt and cell cycle progression ( 61 ) . Moreover , numerous genes participate in drug resistance through regulation of the cell cycle . For example , Phb1 induces G0 / G1 phase cell cycle arrest and promotes cancer cell survival , and silencing of Phb1 expression is a valuable therapeutic approach for chemoresistant ovarian cancer by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to apop - tosis ( 62 ) . Likewise , comprehensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that 15 tumor - suppressor genes ( TSGs ) associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer perform their drug resistance - related functions through 5 pathways including Table I .

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 31 : 745 - 754 , 2014 749 the cell cycle ( 49 ) . In addition , the cell cycle is also involved in drug transportation in cancer . Multidrug resistance driven by ABC membrane transporters is one of the major reasons for treatment failure in human malignancies , and modulation of MDR by cell cycle - related factors has been observed in MCF - 7 breast cancer cells ( 63 ) . Microtubules are intracellular tubular structures found in all eukaryotic cells . Microtubules have various functions including organization of intracellular structure , cell division and intracellular transport ( 64 ) . However , abnormal changes in microtubules lead to drug resistance in cancers . For instance , RASSF1A , tumor - suppressor protein , forms an endogenous complex with tubulin and promotes the stabilization of micro - tubules . Previous research revealed a strong correlation between the reduced relative expression of RASSF1A and taxol resistance in primary ovarian cancer . The reason is that Figure 2 . Protein / gene - protein / gene interaction network of NEK2 generated using the GeneMANIA online tool . The query in blue includes the proteins / genes which directly interact with NEK2 ; the query in pink includes the drug resistant - related proteins / genes which indirectly interact with NEK2 . The type of interactions between proteins / genes are illustrated as indicated by the network legend . NEK2 , NIMA ( never in mitosis gene A ) - related expressed kinase 2 . Figure 3 .

The top 14 bio - logical processes ( p < 0 . 00265 ) which were closely related to the three terms are annotated . NEK2 , NIMA ( never in mitosis gene A ) - related expressed kinase 2 . LIU et al : NEK2 IN OVARIAN CANCER 750 the loss of RASSF1A expression sensitizes cells to microtu - bule destabilizing stimuli finally resulting in the development of drug resistance ( 65 ) . In ovarian cancer treatment , anticancer drugs including paclitaxel , epothilone B ( EpoB ) and discoder - molide all specifically interfere with microtubules and arrest cells in the G2 / M phase of the cell cycle ( 66 ) . Collectively , on the basis of functional annotation , the two ovarian cancer drug resistance - related functions , including cell cycle - and microtubule - related functions , were anno - tated to be the major functions of NEK2 with its interacting proteins / genes of which most are associated with drug resis - tance in ovarian cancer ( Fig . 2 ) . These results suggest that NEK2 may contribute to drug resistance in a cell cycle - and / or microtubule - mediated manner in ovarian cancer . Functional prediction and analysis based on annotation of biological processes . The biological process annotation was performed using COREMINE online database / tool . As shown in Fig . 3 , a total of 14 biological processes were annotated with NEK2 , ovarian cancer and drug resistance ( p < 0 . 00265 ) , which suggested that , on the one hand , those biological processes contribute to the development of ovarian cancer and drug resistance , and on the other hand , NEK2 was associated with these biological processes and it may be a regulator for those processes . Taken together , the annotation of biological processes suggested that NEK2 may contribute to drug resistance via 14 biological processes in ovarian cancer . The 14 biological processes may be mainly divided into two groups including growth / death - related processes which include cell growth , cell division , cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell death and cell cycle - related processes including cell cycle arrest , regulation of cell cycle , mitosis , the cell cycle , S and G2 phase . These results indicate that NEK2 may participate in the regulation of ovarian cancer drug resistance mainly through the cell cycle , cell growth and death , in particular , through the cell cycle . This conclusion was consistent with the result of our functional annotation ( Table I ) . Functional prediction and analysis based on miRNA - mRNA interaction . As shown in Table II , the top 10 miRNAs targeted to NEK2 were predicted by 7 prediction tools , and the drug resistance - related functions of these miRNAs were reviewed and integrated . Among the top 10 miRNAs , 7 are associated with drug resistance in ovarian and other cancers . For instance , the expression levels of miR - 27a were found to be increased in paclitaxel - resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780 / taxol when compared with its parental line A2780 . Transfection of A2780 / taxol cells with inhibitors of miR - 27a enhanced the sensitivity of A2780 / taxol cells to paclitaxel and increased paclitaxel - induced apoptosis , which suggest that the deregulation of miR - 27a may be involved in the development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer ( 67 ) . miRNA expression profiles revealed that miR - 27b is downregulated in most drug - resistant Ehrlich ascites tumor cells , suggesting this miRNA may be involved in drug resistance ( 68 ) , even though no further results have been reported . miR - 150 was found to have low expression in most primary ovarian tumors with significantly increased expres - sion in omental lesions , and miR - 150 increased the number of residual surviving cells by 2 - to 4 - fold when challenged with lethal cisplatin concentrations , indicating that the upregulation of miR - 150 may stimulate survival and increase drug tolerance . Thus , miR - 150 may be a critical regulator for the emergence of drug - resistant disease ( 69 ) . miR - 374a was found to be down - regulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells exposed to cisplatin , resulting in the subsequent modulation of mRNA expression of several targets including DICER1 , DDIT1 and DDIT4 which are involved in the apoptotic process . This indicates that miR - 374a may mediate key pathways implicated in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs ( 70 ) . miR - 630 was found to arrest non - small cell lung cancer A549 Table II .

ONCOLOGY REPORTS 31 : 745 - 754 , 2014 751 cells in the G0 - G1 phase of the cell cycle , correlating with increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 as well as with reduced proliferation rates resulting in greatly diminished sensitivity of A549 cells to the late S - G2 - M cell cycle arrest mediated by cisplatin . These results suggest that miR - 630 may be a novel modulator of the cisplatin response in non - small cell lung cancer ( 71 ) . In addition , miR - 24 - 2 is capable of inducing apoptosis by modulating different apoptotic pathways and targeting BCL - 2 . Furthermore , cells overexpressing miR - 24 - 2 are hypersensitive to DNA - damaging drugs such as cisplatin and undergo apoptotic cell death , suggesting that miR - 24 - 2 may be involved in drug resistance in human cancer cells ( MCF - 7 and HeLa ) ( 72 ) . miR - 128 is obviously expressed at a higher level in drug - resistant breast cancer samples than its expression in drug - sensitive samples . Following transfection with a precursor of miR - 128 or antisense - miR - 128 oligo - nucleotides , the chemosensitivity of MDA - MB - 231 cell was upregulated ( 73 ) , suggesting a direct association of miR - 128 with drug resistance in cancer . In regards to miR - 216b and miR - 486 - 5p , no study has indicated their associations with drug resistance in cancer , but they contribute to several biological processes during cancer development . It has been proven that downregulated expres - sion of miR - 216b is directly related to advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis . Both in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that miR - 216b attenuates cell proliferation , invasion and tumor growth in nude mice ( 74 ) . In addition , miR - 216b , miR - 186 , miR - 337 - 3p and miR - 760 were found to coopera - tively promote cellular senescence through the p53 - p21 ( Cip1 / WAF1 ) pathway in human colorectal cancer cells ( 75 ) . Given that the overexpression of miR - 486 - 5p is closely correlated with the downregulated expression of ARHGAP5 in lung tumor tissues , which considerably inhibits lung cancer cell migration and invasion , miR - 486 - 5p may act as a tumor suppressor contributing to the progression and metastasis of non - small cell lung cancer ( 76 ) . Actually , the biological processes including cell proliferation , invasion , growth and metastasis in which miR - 216b and miR - 486 - 5p are involved are closely related to the development of drug resistance in cancers ( 49 , 77 ) , and the annotation of biological processes also suggests that cell proliferation and growth are associated with drug resistance . All these results indicate that miR - 216b and miR - 486 - 5p may be associated with drug resistance in an indirectly way . Discussion Inferring the functional role of proteins / genes is a primary task in biology , for purposes ranging from general knowledge to drug discovery and diagnostic development ( 78 ) . Protein / gene function prediction based on various genome - wide data is a potential , feasible and valuable strategy for gene function mining , and many large - scale networks of molecular interac - tions within the cell have made it possible to go beyond the one dimensional approach to study protein function in the context of a network ( 79 ) . For example , on the basis of comprehensive bioinformatic analysis , Yin et al ( 77 ) reported that SPARCL1 and CCL21 are associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer . Similarly , 15 TSGs associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer were analyzed by comprehensive bioinfor - matics to overview the relationship of the 15 TSGs with drug resistance and to discover potential TSGs related with drug resistance ( 49 ) . Oncomine is a cancer microarray database and web - based data - mining platform aimed at facilitating the discovery from genome - wide expression analyses . Differential expres - sion analyses comparing most major types of cancer with respective normal tissues are available for exploration . Data can be queried and visualized for a selected gene across all analyses ( 80 ) . The Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) has emerged as the leading fully public repository for gene expres - sion data , predominantly gene expression data generated by DNA microarray technology ( 23 ) . By 2006 , GEO stored approximately a billion individual gene expression measure - ments , derived from over 100 organisms , submitted by over 1 , 500 laboratories , addressing a wide range of biological phenomena ( 81 ) . Thus , the expression data of NEK2 in ovarian cancer tissues and drug - resistant cells retrieved from the two online databases are reliable . GeneMANIA is a web - based database and a tool for the prediction of gene functions on the basis of Figure 4 . Overall procedure of the bioinformatic analysis of NEK2 associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer . NEK2 , NIMA ( never in mitosis gene A ) - related expressed kinase 2 . LIU et al : NEK2 IN OVARIAN CANCER 752 multiple networks derived from different genomic or proteomic data / sources ( 24 ) . Six organisms are currently supported ( Arabidopsis thaliana , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , Mus musculus , Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , and hundreds of data sets have been collected from GEO , BioGRID , Pathway Commons and I2D , as well as organism - specific functional genomics data sets ( 82 ) . Thus , it is fast enough to predict gene functions with great accuracy using this software . COREMINE Medical is a product of the PubGene Company designed to be used for searching information on health , medicine and biology ( 25 ) . COREMINE Medical grew out of Pubgene online tool which is a gene / protein database and a web - based tool for literature mining . Pubgene carries out automated extraction of experi - mental and theoretical biomedical knowledge from publicly available gene and text databases to create a gene - to - gene co - citation network for millions of named human genes by automated analysis of titles and abstracts in over 10 million MEDLINE records ( 83 ) . Therefore , the functions of NEK2 predicted by these two software programs were potentially accurate . miRNAs are a class of small ( 22 bp ) endogenous non - coding RNAs which regulate gene expression at the post - transcrip - tional and translational levels ( 84 , 85 ) . miRNA - mediated post - transcriptional gene regulation is considered as a significant regulator of many cellular processes including cell proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation , angiogenesis , inva - sion , metastasis and drug resistance , both physiological and pathological ( 86 - 88 ) . miRNAs perform their functions through the regulation of their target genes , and it has been well estab - lished that miRNAs represent a class of genes with a great potential for use in diagnostics , prognosis and therapy ( 89 ) . Therefore , we can predict the function of genes through the functions of the miRNAs targeting the gene . miRWalk is a comprehensive database on miRNAs , which collects predicted and validated miRNA binding sites on all known genes of the human , mouse and rat . More importantly , the miRWalk is a potential real - time database , in which the ‘Predicted Target module’ is updated every 6 months and the ‘Validated Target module’ is updated every month ( 26 ) . Taken together , based on the comprehensive bioinfor - matic analysis including microarray data interpretation , protein / gene - protein / gene interaction , annotation of biological processes and miRNA - mRNA interaction ( Fig . 4 ) , we revealed that the expression of NEK2 in drug - resistant ovarian cancer cells was elevated and that NEK2 directly / indirectly interacts with 20 proteins / genes which all contribute to drug resistance in ovarian and other cancers ( Fig . 2 ) . Further analysis based on the annotation of biological processes suggested that NEK2 was closely related to 14 biological processes which are involved in ovarian cancer and drug resistance ( Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , 7 of 10 miRNAs targeting NEK2 are involved in drug resistance in ovarian and other cancers ( Table II ) . Given that NEK2 interacts with numerous proteins / genes , miRNAs and biological processes which were all found to contribute to drug resistance in ovarian and other cancers , upregulation of NEK2 in ovarian cancer and drug - resistant cancer cells may also contribute to drug - resistance . Annotation of biological processes revealed that among the 14 biological processes annotated for NEK2 , 6 were cell cycle - related ( Fig . 3 ) , and the molecular function annotation - based protein / gene - protein / gene interaction obtained similar results . These results suggest that NEK2 may participate in the regula - tion of drug resistance mainly through regulation of the cell cycle . In addition , microtubule - related function was another major function of NEK2 with its interacting proteins in accor - dance with protein / gene - protein / gene interaction ( Table I ) , which implicated that NEK2 may also exert its drug resistant functions via microtubules . Actually , NEK2 has been reported to play important roles in both mitosis and meiosis ( 90 ) and contributes to the establishment of the microtubule - based mitotic spindle ( 27 ) . Collectively , for the first time , we report that the over - expression of NEK2 in ovarian cancers / drug - resistant cells may contribute to drug resistance through regulation of the cell cycle and microtubules . The present study provides important information for further investigation of the drug resistant - related functions of NEK2 in ovarian cancer .
