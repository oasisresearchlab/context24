M ET H O D O L O GY Open Access Motif mining based on network space compression Qiang Zhang * and Yuan Xu * Correspondence : zhangq30 @ yahoo . com Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Intelligent Computing , ( Dalian university ) , Ministry of Education , Dalian 116622 , China Abstract A network motif is a recurring subnetwork within a network , and it takes on certain functions in practical biological macromolecule applications . Previous algorithms have focused on the computational efficiency of network motif detection , but some problems in storage space and searching time manifested during earlier studies . The considerable computational and spacial complexity also presents a significant challenge . In this paper , we provide a new approach for motif mining based on compressing the searching space . According to the characteristic of the parity nodes , we cut down the searching space and storage space in real graphs and random graphs , thereby reducing the computational cost of verifying the isomorphism of sub - graphs . We obtain a new network with smaller size after removing parity nodes and the “ repeated edges ” connected with the parity nodes . Random graph structure and sub - graph searching are based on the Back Tracking Method ; all sub - graphs can be searched for by adding edges progressively . Experimental results show that this algorithm has higher speed and better stability than its alternatives . Keywords : Associated matrix , Space compression , Sub - graph mark , Parity nodes Background Researchers have discovered that the human genome is a complex network system . With the Human Genome Project ( HGP ) , we step into a post - genome era . The network motif [ 1 , 2 ] is generally represented as the smallest unit in a network . Motif analysis is increasingly recognized as a powerful approach to identify the function structure of a net - work , its organizational principle and species evolution . The network motif was first defined systematically in Escherichia coli . After this , algorithms regarding network motif mining were developed . Kashtan , Itzkovita , Milo and Alon [ 3 ] proposed the Edge Sampling Algorithm ( ESA ) , which unfortunately leads to sampling deviation and causes error . Wernicke [ 4 ] described an algorithm for enu - merating sub - graphs , named Enumerating Subgraph ( ESU for short ) , which allows for a faster detection of network motifs and offers useful additional features . Considerable work has been made concerning subgraph searching , and we select the RAND - ESU method for its performance and unbiased estimation [ 5 , 6 ] . Meanwhile , the generating random network model is a key to identifying motifs . We adopt the standard null model [ 7 , 8 ] , in which the degree of every node is not allowed to change , such that sin - gle node properties are fixed . Lau and So .

In addition , sub - graphs are another key to finding motifs because sub - graph isomorphism is an NP - complete problem [ 11 , 12 ] . In order to solve this prob - lem , a method aimed at reducing the searching size was introduced by Ding and Huang [ 13 ] . An algorithm to reduce the complexity of matching two graphs was pro - posed by Knossow , Sharma , Mateus and Horaud [ 14 ] . Another algorithm that opti - mizes the one - to - many matching problem was introduced by Ogras and Marculescu [ 15 ] . Moreover , some more recent algorithms have been developed [ 16 ] , based on the G - trie method to list all stored subgraphs and the implicit tree method [ 17 ] to finding motifs of a size greater than eight . Liao and Chen [ 18 ] presented the Depth - First Spelling algorithm for mining sequential patterns of biological sequences with Gap constraints ( termed DFSG ) . Zhang and Lu [ 19 ] employed a network stratification strategy to investigate the validity of the current network analysis of conglomerate PPI networks , finding that network stratification may help to resolve many contro - versies in the current research of systems biology . Srinivasan , Vural , King and Guda [ 20 ] presented a new substitution - based scoring function for identifying discri - minative lower denominations that are highly specific to a class . Unfortunately , some of these methods , designed for both directed and undirected graphs , proved to be time - consuming . The aim of this paper is to achieve a method for reducing the sear - ching time storage space required for a motif mining algorithm , while storing all sub - graphs . We enumerate all sub - graphs that meet the requirements of a given graph by way of reducing the searching space . Then , the associated matrices of these sub - graphs are normalized and the isomorphic sub - graphs are uniquely marked . Through experiment , we verify the accuracy and extensive applicability of our algorithm , and improve the searching speed of sub - graphs enumeration . In the following , we give some definitions : Definition 1 The Network motif is generally represented as a topological pattern that occurs more often in a given network than in random networks , and takes on a certain function in practical biological applications . We utilize graph theory to research net - work . A sub - graph is considered as a Network Motif when the following conditions are met [ 1 , 2 ] : 1 ) The frequency P < 0 . 01 , from 1000 randomized networks . 2 ) The number of sub - graph in the input graph N real is larger than four . 3 ) Set N real as the number of sub - graphs in the input graph , N rand as the mathematical expectation of the random graphs , the following inequality should be satisfied : N real − N rand > 0 . 1 Nrand . Definition 2 A Network is considered to be a large graph consisting of vertices and edges . A directed graph ( or network ) is usually indicated as G = ( V , E ) , where V stands for a finite set of nodes in the graph and E the edges . Edge e = ( u , v ) ⊆ E represents an edge starting from the node u ( the source ) to the node v ( the target ) . Zhang and Xu BioData Mining 2014 , 7 : 29 Page 2 of 13 http : / / www . biodatamining . org / content / 7 / 1 / 29 Definition 3 In a graph G = ( V , E ) , any two nodes V i and V j that meet the following requirement are called Parity nodes [ 21 ] . i ) Both in - degree and out - degree of V i and V j are the same , stated as < d iin ; d iout > ¼ < d jin ; d jout > : Definition 4 The frequency partition of a graph ( simple graph ) is a partition of its vertices grouped by their degree [ 22 ] . Definition 5 Two sub - graphs G = ( V 1 , E 1 ) and G / ( V 2 , E 2 ) are Sub - graph isomorphic [ 12 ] if there is a one - to - one correspondence between their vertices , stated as f : v 1 → v 2 , and also there is an edge correspondence g : e 1 → e 2 , directed from one node to another node within one sub - graph . e 1 ∈ E 1 , Ψ 1 ( e ) = < u , v > if and only if there is another edge with the same direction between the corresponding vertices in the other sub - graph Ψ 2 ( g ( e ) ) = < f ( u ) , f ( v ) > . Figure 1 is an example of parity nodes and Figure 2 shows the isomorphism visually . Methods In this paper , we provide a new approach for motif mining based on compressing the searching space . Firstly , we use the associated matrices to store directed graphs , and then utilize parity nodes to compress searching space . Secondly , we use Back Tracking to enumerate all sub - graphs of a given size that occur in the input graph which are obtained from real graphs and random graphs . Thirdly , we normalize the associated matrix and mark isomorphism sub - graphs uniquely , by using the Symmetric Ternary to simulate the elements ( − 1 , 0 , 1 ) in the associated matrix . And finally , we distinguish motifs among all the sub - graphs found on the basis of statistical parameters to iden - tify it whether or not . Figure 1 An example of parity nodes . Zhang and Xu BioData Mining 2014 , 7 : 29 Page 3 of 13 http : / / www . biodatamining . org / content / 7 / 1 / 29 Store graphs The storage of graphs is the first step in the process of solving the motif - mining prob - lem . The associated matrix is easy to compress and thus it is easy to know the size of a sub - graph , so we use the associated matrix to store real graphs and random graphs . An associated matrix M ( G ) shows the connection between the nodes and edges of G . It is usually not a square matrix , shown as Figure 3 M G ð Þ ¼ e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 v 1 1 1 0 1 V 2 − 1 0 0 0 v 3 0 − 1 1 1 v 4 0 0 − 1 − 1 In this matrix , a row represents nodes , a column edges , and the algebraic sum of all ele - ments is zero in M ( G ) . In the matrix M ( G ) , the sum of out - degree and in - degree are both equal to the number of edges , stated as X n i ¼ 1 X m j ¼ 1 m ij ¼ 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ m ¼ − X n i ¼ 1 X m j ¼ 1 m ij ¼ − 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) . Figure 2 An illustration of isomorphic graphs . Figure 3 An example of an associate matrix , showing the corresponding relationship between a graph and a form of storage .

The required time increases exponen - tially with the size of the input sub - graphs . For an N - vertex sub - graph , the number of the node label permutation is N ! . In addition , there is a difficult problem using the associated matrix to store graphs , because an element represents both the connection relationship and orientation directly , such as “ - 1 ” . Therefore , we need to adopt the con - cept of symmetrical three hexadecimal to extracting the matrix row by row for get se - quence of symmetric ternary , and the symmetric ternary sequence is a Code number that is unique for each isomorphic class . In order to mark each graph uniquely , we need to standardize the associated matrix , which is useful for sub - graph isomorphism as it can reduce the complexity of sub - graph isomorphism and improve the efficiency of the searching . The detailed process of the standardization of the associated matrix can be referred to as [ 23 ] . e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 v 1 1 0 0 − 1 v 2 0 − 1 1 0 v 3 − 1 1 0 0 v 4 0 0 − 1 1 ⇔ e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 v 1 1 0 0 − 1 v 3 − 1 1 0 0 v 2 0 − 1 1 0 v 4 0 0 − 1 1 ⇔ 100 ‐ 1 ‐ 11000 ‐ 11000 ‐ 11 ð Þ Symmetric Ternary ¼ 13698880 From this example , we know that after two similar matrices get elementarily trans - formed ; we can get the same matrix and a unique Code . One Code marks an isomorphic class . We just have to count the same values of the Codes to detect the motif . We confirm the sufficiency and necessity of this unique mark theoretically , this being outlined below : The sufficiency If isomorphism exists , their associated matrix is similar matrix . According to the pro - perties of the elementary transformation of matrix , similar matrices will become the same matrix after elementary transformation , and so their Code values are the same , and the mark the isomorphism class is the only . The necessity If the following conditions are met between two matrices , we can say that the two ma - trices are equal : the sizes ( the row and column of matrix ) of sub - graphs are the same ; both the numbers of out - degree and that of in - degree are respectively equal ; and so the matrices have the same Code value , and furthermore the corresponding symmetrical ternary number are the same . Under this condition , all the corresponding elements of these matrices are the same . Therefore , we can conclude that these matrices are equal and so they satisfy the requirement of uniqueness . Zhang and Xu BioData Mining 2014 , 7 : 29 Page 5 of 13 http : / / www . biodatamining . org / content / 7 / 1 / 29 Space compression It appears that there is more than one parity node in a graph . The structure and func - tion of these nodes are similar , and the topological network characteristics of these nodes are completely the same . According to the features of the parity nodes , exchan - ging two nodes doesn ’ t affect the topological structure of the whole network . This means that the corresponding associated matrices are similar after exchanging the par - ity nodes , as can be seen in Figure 4 . e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 6 1 − 1 0 0 − 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 − 1 0 3 0 − 1 − 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 1 0 − 1 5 0 0 0 0 1 1 ⇒ change e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 6 1 − 1 0 0 − 1 0 0 4 0 0 1 1 0 − 1 3 0 − 1 − 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 − 1 0 5 0 0 0 0 1 1 We perform a pre - treatment of the searching space before enumerating the sub - graphs . In this pre - treatment , we first identify the parity nodes . In a group of parity nodes , we remove all except the node with the minimum mark number such that the network has no pairs of parity nodes , and then search directly into the network . Finally , we determine the network motifs . In Figure 5 , v 1 , v 2 represent vertex 1 and 2 , respectively , and they are the remaining vertex after compression , e 1 is the edge linking v 1 and v 2 . G r , G p , G cv represent the nodes and edges that remain after compression , the parity nodes that are removed and the vertex and edges connected with the parity nodes , respectively . Upon finishing the compression , we conduct a sub - graph search . At this point , we shall see that the space we need to search is considerably reduced . If we want to search a sub - graph with a specific topological structure , for instance ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) , we need not go through the whole graph to find all sub - graphs with this topology , meaning that searching for sub - graphs like ( 2 , 3 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 2 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) is unnecessary . The aforementioned sub - graphs can be stored in G cv and G p . What we need to do is replace the parity Figure 4 The nodes 2 and 4 are parity nodes . After exchanging their positions , the associated matrices remain similar and these two matrices can get into the same form by elementary transformation , thus possessing the same Code . Zhang and Xu BioData Mining 2014 , 7 : 29 Page 6 of 13 http : / / www . biodatamining . org / content / 7 / 1 / 29 nodes correspondingly and make sure there is no repeating . In this way the searching time is reduced . Enumerating Sub - graphs Back Tracking [ 24 ] is often used to search the optimal solutions of complex problems . It enumerates a set of partial candidates , in which we keep just the initial and the end node of a path . We also reduce the space complexity using the method of saving storage space . We aim to enumerate all sub - graphs of a given size that occur in the real graph , and then we combine the method for enumerating all sub - graphs ( Back Tracking ) with that for compressing space . The hybrid algorithm can reduce the complexity of the sub - graphs enumeration and the searching time . The process of enumerating sub - graphs [ 23 ] can be read for reference . Results and discussion In this section , we will apply our method to some real networks in order to verify the validity . We evaluate our method on the metabolic pathway of the bacteria E . coli , the transcription network of Yeast , the Sea Urchin network , and an electronic network . These can be freely obtained online at http : / / www . weizmann . ac . il / UriAlon / groupNet worksData . html [ 25 ] . Effectiveness of the algorithm Table 1 shows the numbers and structures of motifs with different sizes observed in some different networks , and in this table , we enumerate the number of the sub - graphs that occurred in the real network and the Code that marks them with different num - bers of edge in these networks . In Table 1 , the different numbers of edges and nodes embody the differences between networks . Most motifs are similar in the different networks , but small parts are differ - ent . If motifs have the same topological structure , their Codes shall be the same . This proves the accuracy of the unique mark of isomorphic sub - graphs , and also that of our Figure 5 Two groups of nodes : 2 , 4 and 1 , 3 , 5 . The tablet is storage format of network after compression .

In addition , our method achieves the motif mining in different kinds of net - works , and it proves that our method is both valid and extensively applicable . The results of compression In order to judge the performance of our method , we carry out a series of experiments on a set of testing data . The performance of the method is evaluated by the consump - tion time . We enumerate all sizes of sub - graphs for testing , and then compare them with method [ 26 ] . There are no parity nodes in the electronic circuit network , so the searching time remains unchanged . However , we can compress the searching space in the network based on the properties of parity nodes . In a network , the searching time is different when the size of the sub - graph is differ - ent . For instance as can be seen in Table 2 , the S208 network costs 0 . 001 seconds when there are three nodes in the sub - graph , and 2 . 9 seconds when there are eight nodes . With increasing size , the searching time is amplified tenfold . It shows that the search - ing time is directly proportional to the size of the sub - graph . We will now compare the results displayed in Table 3 . After compressing the searching space , we list the searching time in different net - works with different sizes in Table 3 . To avoid repeated searching , we only search one of the parity nodes and remove the edges connected with the with parity nodes which were abandoned . In this way we obtain a compressed network ; the random network shall be compressed in the same way , which ensures that the random network can be Table 1 [ 23 ] A summary of Code values and the topological structures in different networks ( Continued ) 4 12925664 13698880 In this table , the fourth column contains the numbers of motifs in the real network .

This approach also ensures consistency of a sub - graph regardless of whether it is a network motif . By comparing Table 3 with Table 2 , it can be seen that there are no parity nodes in the electronic circuit networks , such as S208 , S420 , or S838 . Therefore , the time for searching sub - graphs with different nodes is the same before and after compression . The subtle gaps between the results and the original results can be neglected . As for the biological networks with parity nodes , however , the more parity nodes that exist the more obvious the effect of compression is . In the example of the yeast network , the number of the parity nodes is 343 , half the number of total nodes . The time for search - ing sub - graphs is greatly reduced after compression . With increasing numbers of sub - graphs , the efficiency of searching increases up to 10 times for 4 - node sub - graphs . Of course , the efficiency of searching depends on the size of the network as well as the size of the sub - graph searched for , and the current hardware environment . In any network , the searching time is different when the size of sub - graph is different . Through comparison of Tables 2 and 3 , we confirm that the method of compressing the searching space based on the property of parity nodes is feasible , and the effi - ciency of searching is greatly improved by saving storage space . The advantage is par - ticularly evident for a network with many parity nodes . This is a new attempt that ensures the identification of network motifs correctly while also improving the effi - ciency of searching . Comparison of searching times In the previous sections , we have confirmed the effectiveness , accuracy and extensive applicability of our method . We have also confirmed the smaller search space and stor - age space obtained through the compression of parity nodes . In this section , we will compare the results obtained with our algorithm with those from alternative methods [ 5 , 7 , 17 , 26 ] . Due to the limitations of the Feature compression for clustering graphs ( FCGI ) algorithm [ 26 ] , we only tested and compared the Yeast network , and due to the limitations of network data just the results obtained for the E . coli network were com - pared to the other algorithms [ 5 , 7 , 17 ] . The comparison results are displayed in Figure 6 and Table 4 . The comparison between our method and the FCGI method was performed on the same computer environment : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) i3 CPU , 2 . 53 GHZ work station , 1 . 8 G RAM , Windows XP operating system , and Visual C + + 6 . 0 . This ensures that the com - parison is meaningful .

Searching for sub - graphs in a network is the most important part of the motif mining process . The efficiency of sub - graph enumeration is , therefore , an important standard with which to measure the quality of an algorithm . In reference [ 26 ] , the sub - graphs are enumerated by the Rand - ESU algorithm . When there are only three and four nodes , there is only a subtle difference between the time spent on enumerating sub - graphs by Back Tracking algorithm compared with Rand - ESU ; this gap is negligible and can be ignored . However , with more than five nodes , the time spent even before compressing the searching space is considerably shorter than that by Rand - ESU , with an improvement of 27 seconds . Most striking is that after compressing the searching space the time needed is a lot shorter than Rand - ESU , with an improvement of 15 times ( our algorithm ’ s consumption time is about one twelfth of the time in Rand - ESU ) . The algorithm of Mfinder can only search a small range of sizes , and its computa - tional cost is the highest . The FANMOD algorithm , able to find sub - graphs and iso - morphic groups of sizes up to eight , results in the identification of the same numbers Table 4 Computational cost for different algorithms on the E . coli network Time ( s ) Size 3 Size 4 Size 5 Size 6 Size 7 Size 8 Algorithms Before compression 0 . 031 0 . 469 8 . 844 After compression 0 . 016 0 . 266 4 . 141 Kavosh 0 . 300 1 . 840 14 . 910 141 . 98 1374 . 01 13173 . 74 Fanmod 0 . 810 2 . 530 15 . 710 132 . 24 1205 . 97 9256 . 61 Mfinder 31 . 000 297 . 000 23671 . 80 Rows indicate different sizes of sub - graph and columns are related to different algorithms , times are in seconds .

They are compared with the red cuboid ( Rand - ESU in paper [ 26 ] ) . The x - coordinate denotes the size of sub - graph , the y - coordinate denotes the searching time . Zhang and Xu BioData Mining 2014 , 7 : 29 Page 11 of 13 http : / / www . biodatamining . org / content / 7 / 1 / 29 as Kavosh . The searching time of the Kavosh is less than that of FANMOD . With our algorithm , while the size of sub - graphs is limited to a maximum of five , the searching time is shortest . The references [ 5 , 7 , 17 ] , are performed on superior computer hardware than our algorithm : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Quad CPU , 3 . 2 GHZ work station , 8 G RAM . This means that the increase in speed obtained with our algorithm may be even higher . Conclusion In this paper , we presented a method for mining network motifs based on space com - pression . All sub - graphs can be enumerated by adding edges and nodes progressively in a Back Tracking algorithm , which saves storage space and reduces space complexity as only the initial and end nodes of the path are counted . By taking advantages of the par - ity nodes , a much more efficient solution for enumerating sub - graphs during the motif mining is provided . Particularly for networks with high ratio of parity nodes , the time spent on enumerating the sub - graphs is reduced significantly compared with other common algorithms . From the results obtained , we have proved the accuracy and ef - fectiveness of our method . By comparing the results of our method with others , we can conclude that our approach has considerably shorter searching times and more exten - sive applicability .
