A critical aspect in both applications is cellular internalization of NPs , which is influenced by NP properties and cell surface mechanics . Despite considerable progress in the optimization of the NP - bioconjugates for improved targeting , the role of substrate stiffness on cellular uptake has not been investigated . Using polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels as model substrates with tunable stiffness , we quantified the relationship between substrate stiffness and cellular uptake of fluorescent NPs by bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAECs ) . We found that a stiffer substrate results in a higher total cellular uptake on a per cell basis , but a lower uptake per unit membrane area . To obtain a mechanistic understanding of the cellular uptake behavior , we developed a thermodynamic model which predicts that membrane spreading area and cell membrane tension are two key factors controlling cellular uptake of NPs , both of which are modulated by substrate stiffness . Our experimental and modeling results not only open up new avenues for engineering NP - based cancer cell targets for more effective in vivo delivery , but also contribute an example of how the physical environment dictates cellular behavior and function . KEYWORDS : Substrate stiffness , cellular uptake , nanoparticles , cellular spreading , membrane tension , cancer therapy Page 2 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 3 The last decade has witnessed the rapid progress in the design of surface functionalized and bioconjugated nanoparticles ( NPs ) for highly targeted cancer diagnosis and therapy . In order to optimize cellular uptake of NPs for enhanced diagnostic imaging and / or drug dosage in the diseased organs , in vitro experiments 1 - 3 and thermodynamic 4 - 7 and kinetic 8 , 9 analyses have been conducted to elucidate how the size , shape , and surface chemistry of NPs affect endocytosis - mediated cellular uptake . However , to date , there have been no studies aimed at elucidating the role of local physical environments on endocytosis of NPs , despite the widely known effect of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) mechanics on cellular responses and disease states in vivo . Advances in mechanobiology have established that mechanical cues modulate many cell responses , though such modulation is cell - type dependent . In particular , substrate stiffness has been shown to be a regulatory factor for cell spreading 10 , locomotion 11 - 13 , differentiation 14 - 16 , and proliferation 17 . It is possible , therefore , that stiffness - regulated cell responses also modulate NP uptake kinetics , and this phenomenon could be utilized as a new avenue to optimize NP designs for more effective in vivo delivery . The studies of the effect of substrate stiffness on cellular uptake of NPs have other significant implications . In relevant physiological conditions , tumor tissues have different stiffnesses as they go through different stages 18 . In addition , a metastatic cancer cell migrates along tissues of varying stiffness 19 . If the mechanical properties of ECM indeed mediate cellular uptake , such an effect should be taken into account in the optimization of NP - based cancer cell targeting for inhibiting tumor growth and cancer cell metastasis . Though much is known separately about cell responses to their local physical environments and the size / shape dependent cellular uptake of NPs , the effect of ECM stiffness on the cellular uptake , despite its high clinical and biological relevance , remains unexplored .

Herein , we report , using PA hydrogels of varying stiffness as model substrates and fluorescent polystyrene NPs , that the total cellular uptake of NPs by BAECs increases with increasing gel stiffness . To gain insight into the underlying mechanisms , we characterized the relationship between substrate stiffness , spreading area , apical stress fiber formation , and apical membrane tension . By measuring fluorescence lifetime of a lipophilic dye using time - correlated single photon counting ( TCSPC ) , we deduced that increasing substrate stiffness leads to increased membrane tension . The increased tension correlates increased apical actin fiber formation , as confirmed by confocal microscopy imaging . A thermodynamics model complementary to the experimental characterization was then established to rationalize the role of substrate stiffness on the cellular uptake . The model predicts that cell membrane surface area and membrane tension are the governing factors that dictate the cellular uptake of NPs , both of which are modulated by the substrate stiffness . The findings provide new insight into the rational design of NP - based therapeutic and diagnostic agents for disease detection and treatment . Three groups of PA gel substrates were prepared : soft ( 8 % acrylamide / 0 . 02 % bis - acrylamide ) , intermediate ( 8 % acrylamide / 0 . 05 % bis - acrylamide ) , and stiff ( 8 % acrylamide / 0 . 08 % bis - acrylamide ) . The Young’s moduli of the three gels were measured via indentation experiments using an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) and found to be 1 . 61±0 . 11 kPa ( soft ) , 3 . 81±0 . 12 kPa ( intermediate ) , and 5 . 71±0 . 51 kPa ( stiff ) , respectively , all of which fall within the physiological range of biological tissues 15 . We chose the stiffness of this range since the cell line ( BAECs ) Page 4 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 5 used in our experiments is mostly sensitive to this range , as suggested by the previous studies 10 . To facilitate cell adhesion , the gels were surface - coated with fibronectin bridged via Sulfo - SANPAH . The density of fibronectin on the PA gel surface is independent on the gel stiffness , as reported in previous studies 10 , 20 . BAECs were cultured on PA gel substrates for 12 hours before loading NPs into the culture media . Phase contrast images clearly show that the gel stiffness modulates cell morphology ( Fig . 1 ) . Cells on soft substrates rounded up , while cells on intermediate and stiff substrates were much more spread . Cells on intermediate substrates exhibited relatively smaller size compared to those on stiff substrates . This qualitative observation agrees well with the previous reports by Yeung et al . 10 . We further measured the projected spreading area of the cells at certain specified time points upon loading the NPs . The results showed that cell spreading areas remained nearly unchanged after the initial 12 - hour incubation ( Fig . 2 ) . These areas were 276 . 0±58 . 1 µm 2 , 1025 . 1±272 . 7 µm 2 , and 1453 . 9±266 . 7 µm 2 , for soft , intermediate , and stiff substrates , respectively . It should be pointed out that the total apical cell surface areas might be underestimated by the projected area since cells have a non - zero thickness , especially for the cells grown on soft substrates . The cells grown on soft substrates are around 1 . 5 - fold thicker than those on the intermediate and stiff substrates , while the thickness difference between cells on intermediate and stiff substrates is hardly differentiable from their confocal stacks . Treating the round cells as hemi - spherical , the cells on soft substrates have a maximum apical cell surface area of 562 . 3±141 . 3 µm 2 , which is still considerably smaller than the others .

Images were taken after loading the NPs for 6 hours .

The spreading area of the cells on the PA gels of varying stiffness . Cells were cultured on substrates for 12 hours before loading the NPs ( the time clock is set to be zero at the time of loading the NPs ) . The cell spreading reached a steady - state level after 12 - hour incubation ( p > 0 . 16 for all the three types of substrates using the single - factor ANOVA test ) . The difference in the spreading area between any two groups at each time point of measurement is statistically significant ( p < 0 . 01 using Student t - test ) . The numbers of cells studied for each group are listed above each corresponding column . We also examined the influence of gel stiffness on the stress fiber formation in the cells by staining F - actin with phalloidin . Figure 3 shows representative maximal intensity z - projections of F - actin distribution within the cells and corresponding F - actin distribution near the apical surface of the cells on the PA gel substrates . Stress fibers were absent in the round cells on soft gels and only discrete bright spots were observed . Cells on stiff gels exhibited much more aligned stress fibers than those on the intermediate gels . These observations are in good agreement with previous studies 10 , 21 . These features were also evident on the apical surface of the cell where NPs Page 7 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 8 come into contact first ( bottom panel in Fig . 3 ) . Considering the cell morphologies on substrates of varying stiffness , the results also show a positive correlation between the cell spreading and actin stress fiber formation . Figure 3 . The distribution of F - actin within the cells on the PA gels : soft ( left ) , intermediate ( middle ) , and stiff ( right ) . Top : maximal intensity z - projections ; bottom : F - actin distribution near the cell apical surface . Arrows in the figure highlight the well - aligned stress fibers . Previous studies suggested a positive correlation of stress fiber formation and cell stiffness 21 , 22 , yet no direct evidence has been established concerning the relation of stress fiber formation and membrane tension . Conventional approaches to measure cell membrane tension often involve either indenting or tethering cell surface using atomic force microscope 23 or optical tweezer 24 . The applied mechanical stimulation might disturb cell organization and induce cell remodeling 25 , 26 . Our recent molecular dynamics simulation results suggested that the fluorescence lifetime of DiI chromophores embedded in lipid bilayer is an effective indicator of relative membrane tension 27 , which was later confirmed in experiments 28 . Briefly , membrane tension reduces membrane lipid order and headgroup viscosity , and consequently reduces the DiI fluorescence Page 8 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 9 lifetime . Figure 4 shows the fluorescence lifetime of DiI - C 12 within cells on PA gels of varying stiffness . The DiI fluorescence lifetime in cells on soft substrates ( 083 . 0 209 . 1 soft ± = τ ns ) is significantly longer than that on either intermediate ( 079 . 0 083 . 1 inter ± = τ ns ) or stiff ( 088 . 0 088 . 1 stiff ± = τ ns ) substrates , indicating that the cell membrane on soft substrates was much less tense . However , no significant difference in fluorescence lifetime was detected between intermediate and stiff substrates . Figure 4 . Fluorescence lifetime of DiI - C 12 in apical membranes of the cells grown on PA gels of varying stiffness ( 3 repeated experiments , 10 cells / experiment ) . We used carboxylated polystyrene NPs ( PS - COOH ) with diameters of 100 nm in our uptake study . The yellow - green fluorescent dye embedded inside the NPs with minimal photobleaching allows us to quantify cellular uptake at any culture time . Assuming that the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of fluorescent NPs , the average fluorescence yield per unit area Page 9 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 10 within individual cells indicates the efficiency of cellular uptake of NPs . It should be mentioned that in extracting the fluorescence intensity , the seeded cells were extensively washed using DPBS to remove the NPs adhered to the cell surface . Therefore , the fluorescence intensity accounts only for the internalized NPs , as confirmed by our three - dimensional confocal images ( see Fig . A1 in Supporting Information ) . Figure 5a shows that cellular uptake per unit area decreases with the increasing substrate stiffness at all times measured . Compared to the cells on intermediate and stiff gels , round cells on soft gels uptake NPs much more efficiently . It should be pointed out that the fluorescence intensity per unit area is to certain extent overestimated here due to the underestimation to the apical surface area , especially for the cells grown on soft substrates . However , even if we treat the cells grown on soft substrates as hemi - spherical , in which case the apical surface area is twice as much as the measured projected area , its fluorescence intensity per unit area is still higher than that of the cells on intermediate and stiff substrates after 6 hours . The uptake level reached a plateau after 4 hours for cells on both intermediate and stiff gels , but continued to increase even after 12 hours for cells on soft gels . This difference might originate from the distinct membrane tension levels of the cells on gels of varying stiffness . Compared to cells on soft gels , the higher membrane tension of the cells on intermediate and stiff gels resists NPs from entering cells since the uptake involves a higher membrane deformation energy penalty , as detailed next in our theoretical section . Overlaying the phase contrast and fluorescence images shows that the fluorescence signal was concentrated around cell nuclei , but nearly undetectable near the cell protrusions ( Fig . 1 ) . This clear contrast might be indicative of the role of membrane tension in inhibiting cellular uptake at the cell protrusions , where cell membrane was highly tensed as a consequence of richly developed stress fibers 29 , 30 . Page 10 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 11 We further quantified the total fluorescence yield of individual cells on the gels by multiplying the fluorescence intensity per unit area ( Fig . 5b ) by the projected area ( Fig . 2 ) on a cell by cell basis . As seen in Fig . 5b , the total fluorescence yield in individual cells increases with increasing gel stiffness at all time points measured . Similar to the kinetics of the fluorescence intensity per unit area , the total fluorescence yield of cells on intermediate and stiff gels reached a plateau after 4 hours , but not for those on soft gels within 12 hours . The uptake level by cells on soft gels might surpass that by cells on intermediate and stiff substrates after prolonged incubation time . However , since NPs usually are cleared out within several hours after intravenous injection 31 , the uptake level after 12 hours has little clinical implication and thus is beyond the scope of our study . Figure 5 . Cellular uptake of NPs on the gels of varying stiffness . ( a ) The fluorescence yield per unit area of individual cells . ( b ) The total fluorescence yield of individual cells obtained by multiplying fluorescence per unit area by the projected cell area on a cell by cell basis . In both ( a ) and ( b ) , the difference between any two groups at any specified time point of measurement is statistically significant ( p < 0 . 01 using Student t - test ) . Page 11 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 12 Since the NPs used in our experiments were free of surface conjugation with ligand molecules , it is likely that endocytosis occurred in a non - specific manner . From an energetic point of view , NP internalization is driven by non - specific adhesion energy but penalized by membrane bending and tension energies . To arrive at a generalized understanding of the cellular uptake behavior , we next perform thermodynamic analyses of the parametric dependence of NP uptake on membrane area and cell surface mechanics and compare these model results with the experimental data . We simplify the experimental settings by considering a cell with a surface area M , bending modulus κ , and membrane tension σ immersed in a solution with dispersed NPs of surface area 0 A and bulk density φ . Here the membrane tension includes the contributions from both the plasma membrane and the cortical layer underneath the membrane . We denote the number of NPs with a wrapped area A as A n . Through a thermodynamic analysis ( see Supporting Information for detailed derivation ) , the wrapping - size distribution of NPs upon the NP - cell system reaches a steady state can be written as : ) exp ( A A w A M n − = µ ϕ , ( 1 ) where µ is the non - specific adhesion energy density and A w is the associated membrane deformation energy ( including both bending and tension energies ) when an NP is wrapped by an area of A . The NPs are fully wrapped and endocytosed when 0 A A = at which κπ σ 8 0 + = A w A . Therefore , the total cellular uptake N can be written as : ] 8 ) ( exp [ 0 κπ σ µ ϕ − − = A M N , ( 2 ) The cellular uptake per cell surface area is Page 12 of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 13 N M = φ exp [ A 0 ( µ − σ ) − 8 κπ ] . ( 3 ) Equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) provide the basis for the comparison with the in vitro experimental data . Similar formula has been derived for receptor - mediated cellular uptake of nanoparticles 4 , 5 , and the predictions agree reasonably well with corresponding experimental data 1 , 32 , 33 . From Eq . ( 2 ) , the total cellular uptake increases linearly with increasing cell surface area , but decreases exponentially with increasing membrane tension , assuming that the membrane bending modulus κ remains a constant . The theoretical predictions support our experimental data in that NP uptake increases with increasing area ( Fig . 5b and Eq . ( 2 ) ) , and decreases with increasing membrane tension ( Fig . 5a and Eq . ( 3 ) ) . We conclude by noting that substrate stiffness regulated cellular uptake originates from mechanotransduction of cells . As it has been well established , cells of many different types sense physical cues and respond by emanating a series of biochemical signals that modulates cell spreading , cytoskeletal remodeling , and morphological evolution . Though membrane mechanics modifications due to the change of substrate stiffness need to be further quantified , the present work reports the first experimental evidence regarding how local physical environment regulates cellular uptake of NPs , and provides an example of exploiting mechanotransduction in nanomedicine . Considering the dynamically changing physical environments that cells may encounter , for instance , in tumor tissues during different growth stages and in different organs over which metastatic cancer cells migrate , our fundamental understanding of the regulatory role played by the substrate stiffness opens up a new dimension to NP optimization for enhanced chemotherapeutic effects and amplified diagnostic signals .
