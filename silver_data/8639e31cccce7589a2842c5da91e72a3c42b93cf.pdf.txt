Therefore , it is critical to 10 study biological structures in 3D and at high resolutions to gain insights into their physiological 11 functions . Electron microscopy of metal replicas of unroofed cells and isolated organelles has been a 12 key technique to visualize intracellular structures at nanometer resolution . However , many of these 13 protocols require specialized equipment and personnel to complete them . Here we present novel 14 accessible protocols to analyze biological structures in unroofed cells and biochemically isolated 15 organelles in 3D and at nanometer resolutions , focusing on Arabidopsis clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) 16 - an essential trafficking organelle lacking detailed structural characterization due to their low 17 preservation in classical electron microscopy techniques . First , we establish a protocol to visualize 18 CCVs in unroofed cells using scanning - transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) tomography , 19 providing sufficient resolution to define the clathrin coat arrangements . Critically , the samples are 20 prepared directly on electron microscopy grids , removing the requirement to use extremely corrosive 21 acids , thereby enabling the use of this protocol in any electron microscopy lab . Secondly , we 22 demonstrate this standardized sample preparation allows the direct comparison of isolated CCV 23 samples with those visualized in cells . Finally , to facilitate the high - throughput and robust screening 24 of metal replicated samples , we provide a deep learning analysis workflow to screen the ‘pseudo 3D’ 25 morphology of CCVs imaged with 2D modalities . Overall , we present accessible ways to examine the 26 3D structure of biological samples and provide novel insights into the structure of plant CCVs . 27 Page 2 Main Text 28 Cellular processes are reliant upon the assembly and arrangement of organelles and macromolecular 29 complexes . By defining the three - dimensional ( 3D ) structure of these organelles and complexes we 30 can gain critical insights into their physiological mechanisms and functions . This high - resolution 3D 31 imaging of biological samples with nanometer resolution is routinely achieved by combining electron 32 microscopy ( EM ) with tomographic acquisition protocols ( 1 ) . An elegant and extremely useful 33 methodology to prepare biological samples suitable for EM tomography is the metal replication of 34 unroofed cells . This allows the direct visualization of the intracellular landscape and sub - cellular 35 organelles in vivo ( 2 - 6 ) . However , to examine these samples at nanometer resolutions via transmission 36 electron microscopy ( TEM ) , the samples must be on an EM grid . As many of the sample preparation 37 protocols used for EM tomographic analysis of unroofed cells rely upon initially plating the cells onto 38 glass coverslips , the resulting metal replicas must be transferred to EM grids by dissolving the glass 39 with corrosive acids ( 4 , 5 ) ; a procedure which must be conducted by facilities with specialized 40 equipment and highly trained personnel , which restricts their wider use and application . 41 Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) in mammalian cells are a good example of a well characterized 42 organelle where their structures have been defined using EM methodologies for over 50 years ( 7 ) . 43 Consequently , we have a good understanding of their structural details and physiological functions in 44 mediating cellular trafficking through the encapsulation of cargo in spherical membrane vesicles 45 coated by a clathrin lattice ( 7 - 10 ) . This clathrin lattice , composed of repeating clathrin triskelia formed 46 of clathrin heavy and light chains , is arranged into pentagon and hexagon panels ( resembling a 47 honeycomb pattern ) to create a 3D spherical coat / cage covering the vesicle ( 11 - 13 ) . These CCVs are 48 essential trafficking organelles formed during clathrin - mediated endocytosis , where they mediate 49 cargo entry into the cell , and post Golgi - trafficking , to regulate protein sorting ( 8 , 14 - 16 ) . In stark 50 contrast , while CCVs are also essential in plants ( 16 , 17 ) , we know very little about their structural and 51 functional details . A major reason for this is because many of the standard EM sample preparation 52 methods established in other model systems fail to reliably preserve planta CCVs . Furthermore , the 53 TEM images of plant CCVs have been limited to planar two - dimensional ( 2D ) views ( 17 - 19 ) . Therefore , 54 due to a lack of suitable protocols , a robust examination of the 3D structures of plant CCVs has been 55 lacking . 56 To resolve the reliance on protocols which require specialist handling of acids , and facilitate 57 the 3D analysis of plant CCVs at high resolution , we set out to establish protocols accessible to any 58 routine EM lab . Using Arabidopsis CCVs as a model organelle , we describe an accessible novel metal 59 replication protocol which can be performed directly on an EM grid ; thereby removing the 60 Page 3 requirement for specialist equipment and personnel to handle extremely corrosive and hazardous 61 reagents and enabling more researchers to visualize biological samples in 3D at high resolutions . We 62 demonstrated that this standardized workflow produces 3D tomographic representations of single 63 CCVs and allows the direct comparison of CCVs in unroofed cells with biochemically isolated CCVs , 64 finding several subtle structural differences between endocytic CCVs with those biochemically 65 isolated . In addition , we developed a semi - automated deep learning - based workflow which allows the 66 robust high throughput 3D morphological examination of CCVs and validate this approach by 67 examining CCVs structures in cells subjected to disruption of the endocytosis membrane bending 68 machinery . 69 Results 70 Establishing scanning - transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) tomography of CCVs in unroofed 71 protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis seedlings ( Protocol 1 ) 72 The unreliable preservation of plant CCVs in situ has hampered the characterization of these structure 73 by EM methodologies . However , to overcome this we recently established a protoplast metal replica 74 unroofing assay that reliably preserves large numbers of CCVs in plant cells ( 6 , 20 ) . Here , cells were 75 attached to a glass coverslip , ‘unroofed’ ( physically disru pted ) to remove any cellular materials not 76 associated with the plasma membrane ( PM ) directly attached to the coverslip , fixed , and coated with 77 platinum ; thus producing a metal replica of the inside cellular environment of plant cells which can 78 then be examined with EM . As this approach relies upon the use of glass coverslips , visualization of 79 CCVs was limited to 2D views and lacked the resolution to clearly determine the arrangement of the 80 clathrin coat lattice . While we were able to overcome these issues to produce tomographic 81 visualizations of single CCVs ( 6 ) , we relied upon a specialist nanofabrication facility to use hydrofluoric 82 acid to transfer the replicas from glass to EM grids – which is not accessible for many research labs . 83 Thus , to further advance our understanding of the ultra - structural details of plant CCVs , we developed 84 a novel method to produce high resolution 3D tomographic reconstructions of CCVs in plant cells 85 directly adhered onto EM grids , bypassing the requirement for corrosive acids to allow any EM capable 86 laboratory to contribute to the collective knowledge of plant CCVs . 87 We focused our method on utilizing protoplast cells derived directly from Arabidopsis 88 seedlings ( Fig 1A ) . As the cells are prepared and processed directly upon EM grids , a critical step of 89 the method relies upon the cells having a good attachment to the Formvar film on the EM grid . This is 90 because the cells need to adhere strongly enough to remain attached during multiple washing steps 91 and still have a section of the PM attached during the physical unroofing step . We chose to utilize gold 92 EM grids with a Formvar film to remove the possibility of metal toxicity during the incubation steps of 93 Page 4 this protocol . Then we treated these EM grids with a carbon and poly - l - lysine coat to aid the 94 attachment of the cells , which was achieved by letting the cells settle into the grid during a 3 - hour 95 incubation ( Fig . S1 ) . Once attached , the further steps were conducted on small droplets of solution on 96 parafilm sheets due to their small surface area and the fragility of the EM grids . This also enables 97 experimenters to process multiple samples with small volumes of reagents and materials . 98 Given the fragility of the EM grids , it was not possible to unroof the cells with mechanical 99 disruption methods like sonication , which is typically used in unroofing protocols ( 5 ) . Therefore , we 100 relied upon the application of a detergent ( Triton X - 100 ) with gentle agitation of the samples to disrupt 101 the cellular membranes . In addition , to dehydrate the samples rapidly without risking damage to the 102 EM sample grids , we utilized manual application of hexamethyldisilane rather than relying on a critical 103 point dryer device ( 21 ) . The samples were coated with platinum to produce a replica of the unroofed 104 cell , and an additional layer of carbon was applied to enhance the stability of the sample and to 105 prevent electron contamination during image acquisition ( Fig . 1B ) . 106 To visualize the metal replicas of the unroofed cells , and capture 3D images of the CCVs , we 107 employed STEM tomography . We focused exclusively on CCVs formed during clathrin - mediated 108 endocytosis by examining only PM - associated CCVs . Tomograms of individual CCVs were generated 109 by tilting the EM grid through a range of angles ( typically - 72° to + 72° ) along a single tilt axis and images 110 from each perspective were acquired ( Fig . 1C and D ) . The tomogram images were aligned by cross - 111 correlation and used to create a 3D visualization of the CCV ( Fig . 1E and Movie S1 ) . From these 3D 112 reconstructions we were able to precisely determine the structural details of the CCVs , such as 113 diameters , volumes , arrangement of clathrin lattices and lengths of the triskelia arms , by making 114 wireframe models of the CCVs ( Fig . 1F and Table S1 ) . As such , we found that the average Arabidopsis 115 root epidermal cell endocytic CCV has a diameter of 75 . 99 ± 0 . 63 nm , volume of 1868 . 5 ± 45 . 54 µm 3 116 and 17 clathrin panels ( 5 pentagons , 4 hexagons , and 8 not fully visibly closed at the base of the CCV ) 117 with a branch arm length of 16 . 88 ± 0 . 06 nm . 118 Thus , we established an accessible user - friendly ‘on - grid’ metal replication method , which 119 removes the requirement to chemically dissolve glass coverslips , allowing the direct 3D STEM 120 nanometer resolution imaging of CCVs in cells , thereby revealing details of the planta CCVs clathrin 121 coat arrangements . 122 3D analysis of biochemically isolated CCVs prepared using the ‘on - gri d’ protocol ( Protocol 2 ) 123 To demonstrate the versatility of the ‘on - grid’ metal replication protocol , we examined the 3D 124 ultrastructure of CCVs biochemically isolated from plant cells . Here , we employed the same protocol 125 Page 5 for preparing unroofed cells to prepare and visualize purified CCV preparations , allowing the direct 126 comparison of isolated and in vivo organelles , such as purified CCVs with bona fide endocytic CCVs . 127 CCVs were isolated from undifferentiated Arabidopsis suspension cell cultures ( 22 ) , and 128 attached directly to glow discharged and carbon coated EM mesh - grids . The samples were then 129 processed with the same protocol as unroofed cells . Imaging the metal replicas of purified CCVs with 130 STEM tomography allowed the production of 3D reconstructions of the isolated CCVs ( Fig . 2A , B and 131 Movie S2 ) , enabling their quantitative structural analysis ( Fig . 2C ) . We found that the average isolated 132 CCV was 71 . 06 ± 1 . 65 nm in diameter , 1547 . 45 ± 110 . 64 µm 3 in volume and comprised of 17 clathrin 133 panels ( 6 pentagons , 4 hexagons , and 7 not fully visibly closed at the base of the CCV ) with a branching 134 arm length of 18 . 22 ± 0 . 14 nm ( Table S2 ) . 135 This demonstrates the versatility of the on - grid metal replication protocol and provides a 136 standardized protocol to structurally characterize CCVs from different biological sources using STEM 137 tomography . 138 High throughput pseudo 3D morphology screening of CCVs ( Protocol 3 ) 139 While tomographic reconstructions of single CCVs provides the direct visualization of their 3D 140 structure and morphology at high resolution , it is a low throughput approach . Thus , to increase our 141 ability to examine large numbers of CCV structures , we developed a deep learning - based workflow to 142 analyze the morphology of CCVs from images acquired at lower resolutions and in a single plane . This 143 morphologic analysis provides a rapid and robust ‘pseudo 3D’ analyses of CCVs and their formation in 144 a high throughput and unbiased manner . 145 To develop this method , we used images of metal replicas of unroofed protoplasts derived 146 from Arabidopsis root cells attached to glass coverslips ( 6 ) . Here , as the metal replicas were imaged 147 in 2D with a large field of view using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , each image contained many 148 visible CCVs enabling the high throughput visualization of CCVs . To characterize the morphology of 149 the CCVs , we quantify various object features : such as area , maximum and minimum diameters , and 150 average grey value . To date , such analysis has relied upon manual segmentation of the CCVs by the 151 experimenter . To increase the throughput and reproducibility of the morphology quantification of 152 CCVs , we used deep learning to create an accurate CCV segmentation model . To do this , we created a 153 comprehensive training set of image pairs ; consisting of raw images together with these same images 154 where the CCVs are manually annotated ( Fig . 3A ) . This training dataset was then used to train a state - 155 of - the - art neural network model called Cellpose to generate an accurate CCV prediction model ( 23 ) . 156 To increase the robustness and the ability of the model to predict all possible CCV structures , the 157 Page 6 training set included images of metal replicas of unroofed cells derived from wild - type plants and from 158 a mutant that produces clathrin plaques ( which are absent from wild type cells ( 6 , 20 , 24 ) ) . The trained 159 model was then used to automatically detect CCVs in additional images which had not previously been 160 seen by the model ( ‘unseen images’ ) ( Fig . 3B ) . To validate the model predictions , we compared them 161 to manual segmentations on a dataset of CCVs from wild - type cells . From 17 SEM images of metal 162 replicas of unroofed cells , manual segmentation identified 234 CCVs , whereas the automated method 163 successfully predicted 232 ( Table S3 ) . To determine if the CCV segmentations from our model matched 164 those made manually , we calculated an average pixel overlap of 83 % between the manual and 165 automated CCV segmentations using an intersection over union ( IoU ) calculation ( Fig . S2 ) , indicating 166 the Cellpose model predicted the same CCV structures and with high degree of accuracy . The 167 predicted CCV segmentations were then exported as regions of interest ( ROIs ) to FIJI and quantified . 168 This ‘ FIJI analysis ’ step was not automated to provide a checkpoint for users to visualize and confirm 169 the automated CCV segmentations . We found that the average areas reported by manual and 170 automated analyses were not significantly different ( t - test , p = 0 . 35 ) ( 4 . 93 ± 0 . 21 µm 2 ( dimeter of 171 79 . 24 nm ) for manual and 5 . 24 ± 0 . 25 µm 2 ( dimeter of 81 . 71 nm ) for the automated segmentations 172 ( Table S3 ) ) , thus validating the accuracy of this approach . 173 To provide a pseudo 3D metric , CCV curvature , the average grey value of the CCV was used as 174 a proxy for how spherical / 3D the CCV is . During its development , the CCV becomes more protein 175 dense and projects away from the PM , yielding a higher grey value than flat structures on the PM ( 4 ) 176 ( Fig . 3C ) . By normalizing the CCV grey values to an area of flat PM in each image , we can generate 177 relative estimates of 3D curvature and compare them across different images . Comparing the 178 curvature estimation from the manual and automated segmentations from the validation wild - type 179 data resulted in similar values ; 2 . 23 ± 0 . 07 arbitrary units ( au ) for manual and 2 . 19 ± 0 . 07 au for 180 automated segmentations ( Table S3 ) . 181 To highlight the robustness of this protocol in identifying and screening the ‘pseudo 3D’ 182 morphology of CCVs in a high throughput manner , we applied it to SEM images of unroofed cells where 183 the clathrin - mediated endocytosis membrane bending machinery was disrupted ( Fig . 4A ) . These 184 images were of metal replicas of unroofed protoplasts derived from the roots of WDXM2 seedlings , 185 an inducible loss - of - function TPLATE mutant that prevents the formation of spherical CCVs ( 6 , 25 ) , 186 subjected to control ( non - induction ) and disruptive ( induced ) conditions . The automated 187 segmentation successfully detected the clathrin structures during both experimental conditions , 188 finding one additional CCV compared to manual segmentation for each condition . The IoU pixel 189 overlap was 92 % when comparing the manual and automated segmentations ( Table S4 ) , indicating 190 that the structures identified had a high degree of overlap . The area and the estimated 3D curvature 191 Page 7 values of each CCV were plotted against each other for each experimental condition ( Fig . 4B ) , showing 192 the 3D morphological differences of the CCVs in control and membrane bending disruptive conditions . 193 To further define these morphological differences , we imposed thresholds upon the data ( 4 ) . First , an 194 area threshold of 8500 nm 2 ( diameter of ~ 105 nm ) was used to classify clathrin structures as ‘large’ or 195 ‘small’ . To classify clathrin structures based on their 3D shape , we identified ‘curved’ or ‘flat’ 196 structures , which were defined by the average curvature estimation of the 3 flattest CCVs visible in 197 the control conditions determined manually ( 1 . 54 au ) . Combining these thresholds created 4 198 morphological categories to define the clathrin structures : ‘small and round’ ( SR ) representing 199 productive endocytic CCVs , ‘small and flat’ ( SF ) , ‘large and round’ ( LR ) and ‘large and flat’ ( LF ) 200 representing plaques . We found that the majority of CCVs formed during the control conditions are 201 ‘small and round’ ( 94 % compared to 13 % during disruption ) , whereas the majority of CC Vs formed 202 during membrane bending disruption were found to be small and flat ( 70 % compared to 4 % in control ) 203 ( Fig . 4B ) . This agrees with our previous results examining CCVs in metal replicas of unroofed WDMX2 204 protoplasts ( 6 ) , which were based upon time consuming manual segmentations and high - resolution 205 STEM tomography therefore confirming the utility of the automated segmentations for high - 206 throughput screening of the pseudo 3D morphology of CCVs . 207 This , we provide a robust workflow which allows the high throughput pseudo 3D 208 morphological screening of organelles in unroofed cells , enabling robust quantitative analysis of CCVs 209 in cells subjected to physiological disruptions . 210 Discussion 211 Understanding the structural details of biological samples provides key insights into their functions , 212 therefore high - resolution 3D imaging is an extremely powerful tool for investigating cell biology . While 213 EM techniques are routinely used to achieve this , they are traditionally often reliant upon harsh 214 and / or dangerous chemicals requiring specialized facilities to conduct them ( 5 , 6 ) , which can limit their 215 accessibility to the biological community . To overcome this , we developed protocols which allow the 216 3D examination of metal replicated samples in any routine EM lab ( Fig . 5 ) . Specifically , we established 217 a method for preparing samples ( unroofed cells and biochemically isolated organelles ) directly on EM 218 grids , providing a standardized sample preparation protocol which does not require the use of 219 extremely toxic acids . These preparations can be combined with STEM tomography to produce 220 nanometer resolution 3D images . However , as this high - resolution imaging can be time consuming , 221 we also developed a high throughput deep learning - based analysis which provides a protocol for rapid 222 morphological ‘pseudo 3D’ screening of biological structures . While these protocols can likely be 223 adjusted for a range of cell types and organelles , here we applied them to further characterize the 3D 224 Page 8 morphology of plant CCVs - an essential trafficking organelles underpinning many cellular processes 225 ( 26 ) - at high resolutions . We first visualized the clathrin assembly of CCVs in unroofed protoplasts to 226 investigate endocytic CCV structures . By using the same sample preparation for biochemically isolated 227 CCVs , we could directly compare them to specific CCV populations visualized inside cells . While we 228 found that there were small differences in the sizes of endocytic and isolated CCVs , this is likely due 229 to the fact that the isolated CCV preparations from whole cell lysates contain a mixture of CCVs 230 derived from different origins - clathrin - mediated endocytosis and the early endosome / trans - Golgi 231 network ( 22 , 27 , 28 ) . We then validated our high throughput pseudo 3D analysis by applying it to 232 metal replicas of unroofed cells carrying an inducible loss of endocytic membrane bending . 233 To produce samples which reliably contain planta CCVs , we made use of protoplasts . This is 234 because for an unknown reason , CCVs are rarely preserved no matter which EM sample preparation 235 is used with whole plant samples . Therefore , to produce any robust quantitative analysis we had to 236 utilize a cell system which allowed the consistent preservation of CCVs . As a result , we are examining 237 plant CCVs which have formed in a different biophysical cellular environment compared to those in 238 intact plants . However , protoplasts contain the same protein machinery responsible for producing 239 CCVs , and the diameters of the protoplast CCVs ( 76 nm ) are similar to the few reported measurements 240 made in intact plant tissues ( ~ 80 nm ( 17 , 18 ) ) , thus highlighting that the difference in cellular 241 environments does not affect the overall production of CCVs . 242 We focused on utilizing protoplasts derived directly from Arabidopsis seedings . This allows 243 one to use already existing and established genetically altered plants as starting material . 244 Furthermore , it provides the opportunity to reliably examine the effect of mutants upon CCV 245 formation and structure . The use of homozygous Arabidopsis seedlings ensures that every cell 246 unroofed carries the genetic manipulation , which is not possible to guarantee using transient 247 transfection protocols which are not 100 % efficient . 248 Our high - throughput screening of CCVs pseudo 3D morphology analysis was developed using 249 samples attached to glass coverslips . This demonstrates that 3D analysis of samples can be conducted 250 even without high end STEM enabled microscopes . To test the versatility of this analysis we applied 251 the same CCV segmentation model to SEM images of metal replicas of unroofed protoplasts prepared 252 directly on EM grids ( Protocol 1 ) and to isolated CCVs ( Protocol 2 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . We found that the model 253 was accurate for both the in cell and purified CCVs . However , to further improve this accuracy , we 254 suggest training specialized models using representative CCV images of the specific preparation 255 method of interest . 256 Page 9 We also expect our protocols to become a platform for further technical innovations and 257 optimizations to continue advancing our understanding of these critical trafficking organelles . For 258 example , combining these methods with immunolabeling approaches and fluorescence super 259 resolution microscopy , such as correlated light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) procedures , would 260 help to unravel the molecular composition of CCVs and allow the precise localization of CCV related 261 proteins . These sample preparation methods could also aid researchers to further develop focused 262 ion beam ( FIB ) milling approaches to capture images of CCV in situ inside plant tissues . 263 Overall , we present refined accessible user - friendly methods for the 3D analysis of biological 264 samples and investigate the 3D structural details of plant CCVs at unprecedented resolutions and 265 accuracy . The experimental workflows provide the opportunity for the direct comparison of CCVs 266 derived from differing sources , like specific cell types and purified CCV preparations . Additionally , the 267 methods allow one to define individual structures at high resolution and screen CCVs in a high 268 throughput machine learning assisted analysis to robustly quantify their morphology . 269 Materials and Methods 270 For detailed step - by - step protocols of the methodologies presented in this manuscript ( Protocol 1 , 271 STEM tomography of unroofed protoplast cells derived from Arabidopsis seedlings ; Protocol 2 , STEM 272 tomography of isolated CCVs derived from cultured Arabidopsis cells and ; Protocol 3 , high throughput 273 pseudo 3D morphological screening of CCVs ) , please refer to the Supplemental Materials and Method 274 section . 275 Plant materials and sample preparation 276 To generate Arabidopsis root protoplasts , Arabidopsis Col - 0 seeds were sown on ½ AM agar plates , 277 supplemented with 1 % ( w / v ) sucrose . The plates were stratified by incubation at 4°C for 2 - 3 days in 278 the dark and then grown vertically for 8 - 10 days ( 21°C ; 16 hours light and 8 hours dark cycles ) . The 279 roots were dissected from the seedlings and then cut into small sections ( ~ 1 - 2 mm ) in ‘enzyme 280 solution’ ( 0 . 4 M mannitol , 20 mM KCl , 20 mM MES pH 5 . 7 , 1 . 5 % cellulase R10 [ Duchefa # C8001 ] , and 281 0 . 4 % macerozyme R10 [ Serva # 28302 ] in H 2 0 ) . The enzyme solution and sections were then incubated 282 in a vacuum chamber for 20 minutes and then incubated at room temperature and atmospheric 283 pressure in the dark with gentle agitation for 3 hours . The cells were collected by centrifugation at 100 284 rcf ( relative centrifugal force ) for 2 minutes at room temperature . The pelleted cells were washed with 285 W5 buffer ( 154 mM NaCl , 125 mM CaCl2 , 5 mM KCl , and 2 mM MES ) by centrifugation ( 100 rcf for 2 286 minutes ) . The cells were resuspended in W5 buffer and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes . The cells 287 were then centrifuged ( 100 rcf for 2 minutes ) and resuspended in ‘hyperosmotic growth media buffer 288 Page 10 ( 0 . 44 % [ w / v ] MS powder with vitamins [ Duchefa # M0222 ] , 89 mM sucrose , and 75 mM mannitol , 289 pH5 . 5 adjusted with KOH ) and plated on to pre - prepared EM grids ( detailed in the following section ) , 290 where they were incubated in a humid chamber for 3 hours . The cells were then washed with PBS . To 291 unroof the cells , they were then incubated with extraction buffer ( 2 μM phalloidin , 2 μM taxol , 1 % 292 ( w / v ) Triton X - 100 and 1 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol ( PEG ; MW 2 , 000 ) in PEM buffer ( 100 mM PIPES 293 free acid , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA ; pH 6 . 9 adjusted with KOH ) for 5 minutes with gentle agitation . 294 The samples were then washed three times with PEM buffer supplemented with 1 % ( w / v ) PEG 2 , 000 . 295 Samples were fixed using 2 % ( w / v ) glutaraldehyde ( GA ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) via a 30 - minute 296 incubation . The samples were then washed twice with 0 . 1 M PB and stored in 0 . 1 M PB at 4°C until 297 further processing . 298 Purified CCVs samples were isolated from undifferentiated T87 Arabidopsis suspension cell 299 cultures by differential gradient centrifugation , as previously described ( 22 ) . 5 µl of the CCV 300 preparation ( [ 0 . 33 mg / ml ] ) was plated and incubated on a pre - prepared EM grid ( detailed in the 301 following section ) for minutes . Whatman TM blotting paper was used to remove the excess solution . 302 The samples were then fixed by a 30 - minute incubation with 2 % GA in 0 . 1 M PB via a 30 - minute 303 incubation . 304 EM grid preparations 305 Gold EM grids with Formvar - film ( Electron Microscopy Sciences # G300PB - Au ) were used for 306 processing protoplast samples . They were coated with carbon to a thickness of 10 nm using a Leica 307 ACE600 coating device . The grids were then supplemented with poly - l - lysine ( Sigma ) by a 15 - minute 308 incubation and washed with H 2 O . 309 Copper EM grids with carbon - film ( Electron Microscopy Sciences # CF300 - Cu ) were used for 310 isolated CCV preparations . They were subjected to glow discharge ( 4 min at 7x10E - 1 mbar ) using the 311 ELMO glow discharge system ( Agar Scientific Ltd . ) . 312 Metal replication of samples 313 The fixed samples were washed with 0 . 1 M PB and H 2 O , and then incubated with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) tannic 314 acid for 20 minutes . The samples were washed three times with H 2 O and incubated with 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) 315 uranyl acetate for 20 minutes . To dehydrate the samples , they were washed three times with H 2 O , 316 infiltrated with graded ethanol ( 10 % , 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % , 96 % and 100 % ) and subjected to a 2 - 317 minute incubation with hexamethyldisilane . The samples were then dried by evaporation . The 318 samples were then coated with 3 nm platinum and 4 nm carbon using the ACE600 coating device 319 ( Leica Microsystems ) . 320 Page 11 STEM tomography 321 STEM tomograms were acquired with a JEOL JEM2800 scanning - transmission electron microscope 322 ( 200 kV AV ) control by STEM Recorder ( https : / / temography . com / en / ) . Diameters of the CCVs were 323 determined from the 0° single plane STEM image , where an average value was calculated from the 324 maximum and minimum Feret distances of a ROI drawn around the CCV in Fiji ( 29 ) . This value was 325 then used to calculate a spherical volume . Tomograms of single CCVs were recorded over a range of 326 ~ - 72° to + 72° along single tilt axis with step size 4° . They were aligned and reconstructed using 327 Composer ( https : / / temography . com / en / ) . Wireframe models of the CCVs were manually created 328 using Evo - viewer ( https : / / temography . com / en / ) , which were used to quantify aspects of the CCV 329 structure . Data was collected from at least 2 repeats . Reported quantitative measurement values in 330 the main text are reported as mean ± SEM . 331 High throughput pseudo 3D morphology screening of CCVs 332 SEM images of metal replicas of unroofed protoplasts , taken with a FE - SEM Merlin Compact VP 333 equipped with an In - lens Duo detector , were obtained from Johnson et al ( 6 ) . This included images of 334 CCVs in Col - 0 and WDMX2 protoplasts incubated in control ( 4 - hour incubation at room temperature ) 335 or endocytic membrane bending disruptive ( 4 - hour incubation at 37°C ) conditions , which were 336 collected using the same magnification ( ~ 45 k ) and pixel size settings ( ~ 2 . 4 - 2 . 6 nm ) . These protoplasts 337 were prepared on glass coverslips as previously described ( 6 ) . 338 For the automated segmentation of CCV , we first generated a training set consisting of 13 339 example image pairs ( raw image and segmentation masks ) of the CCVs in replica images of wild type 340 and WDXM2 cells subjected to control or disruptive conditions . CCVs in the raw images were manually 341 annotated using the Napari software ( 30 ) . We then trained Cellpose ( 23 ) using input for 5000 epochs 342 ( see Protocol 1 for further details ) . The resulting trained model was then used to segment individual 343 CCVs . To determine the localization accuracy of the automated CCV segmentation , we calculated the 344 mean pixel - wise Intersection over Union ( IoU ) of manually annotated and predicted CCVs . Pixel - wise 345 IoU is defined by the number of pixels in both , the 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 and the 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 CCV segmentation 346 mask , over the number of pixels of the union of both segments . 347 𝐼𝑜𝑈 = | 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∩ 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 | | 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∪ 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 | 348 The predicted segmentation ROIs were then exported to Fiji ( 29 ) to quantify the area and average grey 349 value of each CCV . Diameters of the equivalent circle were calculated from the CCV area . To estimate 350 the curvature / pseudo 3D of the CCV , the average grey value of the CCV ROI was normalized by division 351 Page 12 to the average grey value of 4 manually selected PM ROIs in each image . The area and pseudo 3D 352 values were plotted to define the overall morphology of a CCV . This was then divided in to 4 353 morphological categories ( SR , small and round ; SF , small and flat ; LR , large and round ; LF , large and 354 flat ) using an area threshold of 8500 nm 2 ( a CCV diameter of 105 nm ) and a 3D value of 1 . 52 ( the 355 average of the 3 smallest CCVs in control conditions determined to be spherical by the experimenter ) . 356 Data Availability 357 Example data and the code generated in this study is available at : 358 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 6563819 359 Acknowledgements 360 This research was supported by the Scientific Service Units of Institute of Science and Technology 361 Austria ( ISTA ) through resources provided by the Electron Microscopy Facility , Lab Support Facility and 362 the Imaging and Optics Facility .

STEM tomography of CCVs in metal replicas of unroofed protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis 371 seedlings 372 ( A ) Roots from Arabidopsis seedlings are dissected and treated to produce protoplast cells . ( B ) The 373 cells are then attached directly to EM grids and unroofed ( magenta dashed line ) such that only the 374 plasma membrane and its associated structures remain attached to the EM grid . This is then coated 375 with metal to make a replica of the intracellular landscape . ( C ) The replica is visualized using EM 376 tomography , where the sample is tilted through a series of angles allowing many perspectives of CCVs 377 to be acquired ( yellow dashed box ) .

High throughput deep learning analysis of CCV pseudo - 3D morphology 390 ( A ) Model training : example image from the training set with manual annotation ( left hand image , 391 multiple colors ) overlaid of metal replicas of unroofed Arabidopsis root protoplasts acquired by SEM . 392 ( B ) Model prediction : the model was used to predict CCVs in images not included in the training set 393 ( “unseen image” ) , which is outputted as a series of ROIs of CCVs ( yellow outline ) . ( C ) The predicted 394 CCV ROIs are opened in Fiji to quantify morphological features of each CCV . ( Blue box ) a pseudo 3D 395 metric is provided by the gray value of the CCV as the more spherical a CCV is , the higher its grey value ; 396 the grey values of the PM ( magenta dashed line ) , a clathrin plaque ( green dashed line ) and typical CCV 397 ( blue dashed line ) are measured along the yellow dashed line and is quantified on the left plot .
