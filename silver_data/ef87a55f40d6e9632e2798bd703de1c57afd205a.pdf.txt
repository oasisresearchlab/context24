Small molecule inhibitors CK - 666 and CK - 869 bind to Arp2 / 3 complex and inhibit nucleation , but their modes of action are unknown . Here , we use biochemical and structural methods to determine the mechanism of each inhibitor . Our data indicate that CK - 666 stabilizes the inactive state of the complex , blocking movement of the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits into the activated ﬁlament - like ( short pitch ) conformation , while CK - 869 binds to a seren - dipitous pocket on Arp3 and allosterically destabi - lizes the short pitch Arp3 - Arp2 interface . These results provide key insights into the relationship between conformation and activity in Arp2 / 3 com - plex and will be critical for interpreting the inﬂuence of the inhibitors on actin ﬁlament networks in vivo . INTRODUCTION Small molecule inhibitors play important roles as drugs and as research tools , and increasing the types of macromolecules that can be targeted by small molecules is an important focus of pharmacological and biochemical studies . While active sites of enzymes are frequently targeted , proteins lacking a catalytic site can also be inhibited using molecules that disrupt protein - protein interfaces critical for function . Small molecules can also be used to inhibit large molecular assemblies that serve as multi - functional molecular machines ( Pommier and Marchand , 2012 ) . In such assemblies , small molecules can selectively block one of multiple active sites , protein - protein interfaces , or conforma - tional changes critical for discrete aspects of macromolecular function . Therefore , small molecule inhibitors can become powerful tools to dissect the mechanism of macromolecular as - semblies in vitro and in vivo . However , realization of this potential requires a precise determination of how the small molecules inhibit function . Actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex is a seven - subunit macromolecular machine that regulates the actin cytoskeleton . It catalyzes the kinetically slow process of actin ﬁlament nucle - ation ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ; Sept and McCammon , 2001 ) , a reaction regulated in cells to allow precise spatial and temporal control of the assembly of actin ﬁlament networks ( Firat - Karalar and Welch , 2011 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of pre - existing ( mother ) actin ﬁlaments and nucleates a new ( daughter ) ﬁlament in a complex reaction that requires interaction of Arp2 / 3 complex with ﬁlaments , actin monomers , ATP , and activating proteins called nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Figure 1A ) . WASp / Scar family pro - teins , the best characterized NPFs , have a conserved region called VCA . The CA motif of VCA binds Arp2 / 3 complex and the V region binds actin monomers , tethering them to the com - plex ( Boczkowska et al . , 2008 ; Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ) . High - resolution X - ray crystal structures show that , in the absence of NPFs , Arp2 and Arp3 , the two actin - related subunits in the complex , are splayed apart ( Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ; Robinson et al . , 2001 ) . Electron microscopy reconstructions show that , upon activation , Arp2 moves (cid:1) 25 A˚ to form a dimer with Arp3 that mimics a short pitch actin dimer within a ﬁlament , thereby providing a template for nucleation of a new ﬁlament ( Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . How the activating factors initiate short pitch conformation is not known , and whether small molecules could be exploited to block this large conformational change is not clear . Previously , two distinct classes of small molecule Arp2 / 3 com - plex inhibitors were discovered , CK - 636 and CK - 548 , which block nucleation of actin ﬁlaments by Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) . Treatment of cultured cells with these inhib - itors blocks formation of actin structures known to require Arp2 / 3 complex , including Listeria actin comet tails , podo - somes , and yeast endocytic actin patches ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ; Rizvi et al . , 2009 ) . Because they provide a simple , fast - acting , and reversible method of inhibition , these compounds can be powerful tools to probe the role of Arp2 / 3 complex in other actin - remodeling processes . Crystal structures of CK - 636 and CK - 548 bound to Arp2 / 3 complex provided preliminary clues as to how they might function , but the molecular mechanism of inhibition has not been determined . Here , we use a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods to determine the mechanisms of CK - 666 and CK - 869 , more potent versions of parent compounds CK - 636 and CK - 548 . Despite their distinct binding sites , our data sug - gest that both CK - 666 and CK - 869 inhibit nucleation by blocking the movement of Arp2 into the short pitch conformation . Remarkably , conformational trapping by each inhibitor is accomplished by a different mechanism . CK - 666 functions as a classical allosteric effector , stabilizing the inactive state of Chemistry & Biology 20 , 701 – 712 , May 23 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 701 the complex , while CK - 869 appears to directly disrupt key pro - tein - protein interfaces in the short pitch Arp2 - Arp3 dimer to destabilize the active state . By measuring the inﬂuence of the inhibitors on interactions of the complex with NPFs , ATP , actin monomers , and ﬁlaments , we provide insight into the relation - ship between conformation and activation and a basis for under - standing the effects of the inhibitors on branched actin networks in vivo . These results support the feasibility of using small mole - cules to both allosterically disrupt protein - protein interfaces and to lock multiprotein complexes in inactive conformations by targeting and stabilizing subunit interfaces . RESULTS Crystal Structure of CK - 869 Bound to Arp2 / 3 Complex CK - 666 and CK - 869 are commercially available compounds derived from CK - 636 and CK - 548 , respectively ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ; Figure 1B ) . The recently reported crystal structure of CK - 666 bound to Arp2 / 3 complex showed that , like CK - 636 , it binds to a pocket at the interface of Arp2 and Arp3 , suggesting both inhibitors may block formation of the Arp2 - Arp3 short pitch dimer ( Baggett et al . , 2012 ; Figure 1C ) . While chemically similar to its parent compound , it is not known if CK - 869 occupies the same binding pocket as CK - 548 . Therefore , we solved the crystal structure of CK - 869 bound to Bos taurus ( Bt ) Arp2 / 3 com - plex . A 2 . 75 A˚ resolution crystal structure showed that CK - 869 , like CK - 548 , binds to a hydrophobic cleft in subdomain 1 of Arp3 , making a single hydrogen bond with the amide group of Asn118 ( Figures 1D , 1E , and Figure S1 available online ; Table S1 ) . As with CK - 548 , binding of CK - 869 locks the sensor loop into an open position . Similarity between this structure and the CK - 548 - bound structure indicates that CK - 548 and CK - 869 use a common mechanism of inhibition . CK - 869 Causes Structural Changes in ATP - Bound Arp3 that May Contribute to Complex Inactivation Arp2 / 3 complex requires ATP to nucleate actin ﬁlaments ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) , and mutations in the nucleotide binding pockets ( NBP ) of Arp2 or Arp3 cause defects in nucleation ( Goley et al . , 2004 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ) and branched network turnover Figure 1 .

Because neither inhibitor binds to the NBP of Arp3 or Arp2 , we ruled out direct competition with ATP as an inhibition mechanism . However , the sensor loop in actin and actin - related proteins is allosterically linked to the nucleotide binding pocket ( Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ; Otterbein et al . , 2001 ) , so we reasoned that the sensor loop ﬂip caused by CK - 869 might inﬂuence ATP binding to Arp3 . Therefore , we measured the afﬁnity of 1 - N 6 - etheno - ATP ( ε - ATP ) to BtArp2 / 3 complex in the presence and absence of inhibitors ( Figure 2A ) . Previous ex - periments showed that the signal of this assay is predominantly due to binding of ε - ATP to Arp3 ( Le Clainche et al . , 2001 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ) . ε - ATP bound with a K D = 3 . 0 ± 0 . 4 m M in the absence of inhibitor , and the K D did not change signiﬁcantly in the pres - ence of saturating CK - 666 or CK - 869 , indicating that neither compound inactivates Arp2 / 3 complex by blocking ATP binding to Arp3 . To determine if CK - 869 inﬂuences ATP - induced confor - mational changes , we solved the 2 . 5 A˚ cocrystal structure of Arp2 / 3 with bound ATP and CK - 869 . Importantly , CK - 869 does not prevent the cleft of Arp3 from closing , a conformational change observed in other ATP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex struc - tures and thought to be required for activation of the complex ( Goley et al . , 2004 ; Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ; Figures 2B – 2D ) . However , binding of CK - 869 to ATP - loaded Arp3 caused several signiﬁcant structural changes . First , Pro115 and Pro116 in the loop between b 7 and a C move (cid:1) 1 . 5 A˚ toward the space previously occupied by the sensor loop ( Fig - ures 2E and S2 ) . This movement causes Gln144 , a conserved residue in the nucleotide cleft , to adopt a position in which it directly contacts the calcium in the nucleotide cleft , as opposed to making a water - mediated contact , as observed in other ATP - bound actin and Arp2 / 3 complex structures ( Figure S2 ; Nolen et al . , 2004 ; Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ) . These changes do not occur in the CK - 869 - bound structure without ATP and may be critical for inhibition by CK - 869 , as discussed below . Figure 2 .

Chemical crosslinking and analytical ultracentrifugation ex - periments demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 complex binds to two VCA molecules ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Padrick et al . , 2011 ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that VCA binds more tightly to one of the two sites , consistent with a recent observa - tion that only a 1 : 1 and not a 2 : 1 VCA : Arp2 / 3 assembly can be isolated by gel ﬁltration ( Gaucher et al . , 2012 ; Ti et al . , 2011 ) . Initial characterization of the inhibitors showed that neither com - pound signiﬁcantly affects binding of monomeric N - WASp - VCA to the high afﬁnity NPF site , hypothesized to be on Arp2 and ARPC1 ( Figure 3A ; Nolen et al . , 2009 ; Padrick et al . , 2011 ; Ti et al . , 2011 ) . The second NPF site binds VCA 100 - fold more weakly and is hypothesized to be on Arp3 ( Ti et al . , 2011 ) . Cross - linking , X - ray crystallography , and molecular modeling suggest the second NPF site is on the ‘‘back side’’ of Arp3 relative to the mother ﬁlament binding face ( Padrick et al . , 2011 ; Ti et al . , 2011 ; Figure 3A ) , although density from recent single particle - averaged electron microscopy structures suggest VCA binds to the pointed ends of Arp3 and Arp2 ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . Both NPF binding sites are critical for activation of the complex ( Ti et al . , 2011 ) , but it is not known if the inhibitors affect interactions of VCA with the low - afﬁnity site . Therefore , we used a chemical crosslinking assay to test the effect of the inhibitors on VCA bind - ing at each site . N - WASp - VCA labeled with benzophenone - 4 - maleimide ( B4M ) at position 464 ( N - terminal to its C region ) forms a UV - induced covalent crosslink with Arp2 or Arp3 sub - units , resulting in the appearance of two higher molecular weight bands ( Figure 3B ) . Addition of 200 m M CK - 869 or CK - 666 did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence crosslinking to Arp2 or Arp3 , suggesting neither inhibitor functions by blocking VCA from binding to either site . In contrast , addition of cortactin or Crn1 , proteins that compete with VCA at only the Arp3 or Arp2 site , respectively ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Weaver et al . , 2002 ) , signiﬁcantly reduced Figure 3 .

To quantitatively probe the binding to Arp3 , we also tested the effect of the inhibitors on the afﬁnity of the N - terminal acidic region ( NTA ) of cortactin in a ﬂuorescence anisotropy binding assay . Alexa - 546 - labeled NTA bound to the complex with a K D of 0 . 98 ± 0 . 09 m M ( Figure 3C ) . Neither CK - 666 nor CK - 869 had a signiﬁcant effect on the binding of Alexa - 546 - NTA ( K D = 1 . 2 ± 0 . 1 and 0 . 8 ± 0 . 1 , respectively ) , however the anisotropy saturates at a lower value in the presence of CK - 869 , indicating the complex could adopt a different confor - mation . Together , these data show that neither inhibitor has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence at either NPF site and that neither inhibitor functions by blocking activator binding . Actin polymerization as - says support this conclusion , since high concentrations of VCA could not overcome inhibition by CK - 666 and CK - 869 ( Figure 3D ) . Inhibitors Do Not Inﬂuence Interactions with Sides or Ends of Filaments or Disassemble Preformed Branches Branching nucleation requires binding of the complex to the sides of ﬁlaments ( Achard et al . , 2010 ; Goley et al . , 2010 ; Mache - sky et al . , 1999 ) , so we measured the inﬂuence of the inhibitors on copelleting of the complex with preformed actin ﬁlaments . BtArp2 / 3 complex bound to actin ﬁlaments with a K D = 0 . 9 ± 0 . 3 m M ( Figure 3E ) . CK - 666 and CK - 869 each increased the K D to 2 ± 1 m M , which is within the range of afﬁnities measured for uninhibited Arp2 / 3 complex from a range of species ( Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ; Goley et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , defects in actin ﬁlament side binding cannot account for inhibition . Arp2 / 3 complex also binds to the pointed ends of ﬁlaments , and binding has been hypothesized to require adoption of the short pitch dimer ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ; LeClaire et al . , 2008 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . We measured pointed end capping by titrating gelsolin - capped actin ﬁlaments with increasing con - centrations of the complex and measuring polymerization from free pointed ends . The apparent K D of Arp2 / 3 complex was 1 . 3 ± 0 . 2 m M without inhibitors and 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 m M and 0 . 5 ± 0 . 05 m M in the presence of 200 m M CK - 666 and CK - 869 , respec - tively ( Figure 3F ) . Therefore , the inhibitors do not block pointed end binding . To determine if the inhibitors inﬂuence interactions of the complex with actin ﬁlaments in the context of a branch junction , we used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to monitor branch dissociation in the presence and absence of the inhibitors . Branches were formed in the absence of inhibitor then washed with a buffer containing inhib - itor or DMSO as a control . Time - lapse movies show that neither inhibitor increased the rate of branch dissociation over the time - scale measured ( Figures 3G and 3H ) . This suggests that neither inhibitor actively disassembles branches . CK - 869 and CK - 666 Block a Conformational Change Caused by VCA - Recruited Actin Monomers Binding to Arp2 / 3 Complex Because neither inhibitor affected the interaction of Arp2 / 3 com - plex with actin ﬁlaments , NPFs , or ATP , we next asked if the in - hibitors inﬂuence actin monomer recruitment . Padrick et al . ( 2011 ) recently used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracen - trifugation ( AUC ) to demonstrate two VCA peptides , each with an actin monomer bound , can simultaneously bind to Arp2 / 3 complex to form a stable 2 : 2 : 1 VCA : actin : Arp2 / 3 complex . We repeated this experiment using glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - dimerized VCA and showed that the sedimentation coefﬁ - cient distribution proﬁles of a mixture of Bt Arp2 / 3 complex with excess GST - VCA and latrunculin B - bound actin yielded peaks at 5 . 8 S and 11 . 9 S . The experimentally determined molec - ular weights of these peaks are consistent with a 2 : 2 GST - VCA 2 : actin 2 complex and a 2 : 2 : 1 actin 2 : GST - VCA 2 : Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . This demonstrates that GST - VCA can simultaneously recruit two actin monomers to the com - plex . We found that saturating concentrations of inhibitors caused signiﬁcant differences in sedimentation of the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly , with the peak shifting from 11 . 9 S to 11 . 4 S in the pres - ence of CK - 666 or CK - 869 ( Figures 4C – 4F ) . Subsaturating concentrations of each inhibitor resulted in broader peaks with intermediate S values , indicating rapid conversion between fast and slower sedimenting species ( Figure 4C ) . Neither inhibi - tor inﬂuenced the sedimentation proﬁles of Arp2 / 3 complex alone , and both caused only small changes in the S values of Arp2 / 3 complex with GST - VCA bound ( Figures 4E and 4F ) . The decreased sedimentation coefﬁcient of the fast pelleting species could be due to dissociation of components of the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly or a large conformational change caused by the inhibitors . The reduction in S is not large enough to be consis - tent with dissociation of either the entire GST - VCA 2 : actin 2 heter - otetramer or two actin monomers from the assembly , so we reasoned that the inhibitors might cause dissociation of a single actin monomer . To test this directly , we repeated the sedimenta - tion velocity experiments using Oregon green - labeled actin to track its sedimentation . If the inhibitors cause one actin mono - mer to dissociate , the integrated area of the rapidly sedimenting peak will decrease by one half . Instead , we observed that area of the peak does not change in the presence of the inhibitors ( Fig - ure 4G ) . In addition , the frictional coefﬁcient ratios of the 2 : 2 : 1 assemblies increased from 1 . 6 to 2 . 1 or 2 . 0 in the presence of CK - 666 or CK - 869 , respectively , indicating the inhibitor - bound assembly adopts a less spherical conformation . Using the fric - tional coefﬁcients and the S values , we calculated the experi - mental mass of the assemblies in the presence of the inhibitors and found that they were also consistent with a 2 : 2 : 1 assembly ( Figure 4C ) . These observations indicate that inhibitors do not cause actin monomers to dissociate from the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly but instead cause a large conformational change that slows its sedimentation . Developing a Biochemical Assay to Directly Probe for the Short Pitch Conformation Our AUC data suggest that GST - VCA and actin monomers favor a conformation of the complex that is blocked by the inhibitors . While no high - resolution structures of the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly are available , low resolution electron microscopy ( EM ) reconstruc - tions of Arp2 / 3 complex with bound NPFs suggest that binding of N - WASp alone stimulates formation of the short pitch Arp2 - Arp3 dimer ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly may adopt the short pitch conformation in the absence of inhibitors and that this conformation is blocked when inhibitors are bound . To test this hypothesis , we developed a biochemical assay to directly detect the splayed ( inactive ) to short pitch ( ﬁlament - like ) structural change . We engineered Chemistry & Biology Mechanism of Arp2 / 3 Complex Inhibitors Chemistry & Biology 20 , 701 – 712 , May 23 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 705 cysteines in budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex to create a crosslink - ing probe sensitive to the relative position of Arp2 and Arp3 . We created two mutant complexes , Arp - 021 and Arp - 024 , in which cysteine pairs on Arp2 and Arp3 are predicted to be within cross - linking distance in the short pitch Arp2 - Arp3 dimer but not in the splayed conformation ( Figure 5A ; Robinson et al . , 2001 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . While we observed some variability in preparations , Arp - 021 showed similar activity to the wild - type complex in pyrene actin polymerization assays ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . In con - trast , Arp - 024 consistently showed increased activity compared to wild - type . Both mutant complexes were inhibited by CK - 666 , though inhibition was weaker than in wild - type complex ( Fig - ure 5D ) . We are currently dissecting the molecular basis for the differences in activity and in susceptibility to CK - 666 . We note that , because both complexes are active , stimulated by NPF ( Figure 5C ) , and inhibited by CK - 666 , they can be used to probe for inhibition of NPF - induced activating conformational change by the inhibitor . In the presence of GST - VCA and latrunculin B - bound actin monomers , both double cysteine mutants produced a high molecular weight band reactive to an anti - Arp3 antibody when treated with bis ( maleimido ) ethane ( BMOE ) , an 8 A˚ sulfhydryl crosslinking reagent ( Figure 5E ) . The crosslinked product also reacted with an Arp2 antibody ( Figure S3A ) and did not form in the single cysteine mutant controls , indicating that the crosslink is between the engineered cysteines . Small molecule CK - 869 does not inhibit the budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and did not decrease formation of the Arp3 - Arp2 crosslink , showing there is a correlation between inhibition and the reduction in crosslinking ( Figure S3B ) . Therefore , both Arp - 021 and Arp - 024 Arp2 / 3 complexes can be used to probe for the short pitch conformation . Actin Monomers Directly Contribute to Formation of the Short Pitch Conformation Binding of VCA alone causes conformational changes in Arp2 / 3 complex that have been investigated by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) and two - and three - dimensional electron microscopy reconstructions , but less is known about the inﬂu - ence of VCA bound to actin monomers ( Boczkowska et al . , Figure 4 .

Therefore , to better understand how the inhibitors inﬂuence the conformation of the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly , we ﬁrst used the cysteine double mutants to test the relative contribution of actin mono - mers and GST - VCA to formation of the short pitch conformation . Unexpectedly , we found that a reaction containing GST - VCA but not actin monomers had decreased crosslinking compared to a reaction containing both actin monomers and GST - VCA ( Fig - ure 5F ) . These data demonstrate that actin monomers recruited by VCA play an active role in favoring the short pitch conforma - tional change . In some reactions , we observed crosslinking even in the absence of activators , though it was always signiﬁcantly less than with VCA or actin monomers and VCA ( Figure S3C ) . This observation is consistent with the reported levels of consti - tutive activity in budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( Wen and Ruben - stein , 2005 ) and with single - particle EM studies that show a signiﬁcant fraction of budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex adopts a closed ( and presumably active ) conformation in the absence of NPFs ( Rodal et al . , 2005 ) . Together , our results demonstrate the short pitch conformation is sampled even without activators but that GST - VCA and actin monomers cooperate to skew the conformational equilibrium toward the short pitch conformation . CK - 869 and CK - 666 Block Formation of the Short Pitch Dimer We next tested the effect of CK - 666 on crosslinking . CK - 666 at 200 m M eliminated the Arp2 - Arp3 crosslink formed in the absence of activating factors and reduced the amount of the crosslinked band formed in the presence GST - VCA or GST - VCA and actin ( Figures 5G , 5H , and S3C ) . These data demon - strate that CK - 666 blocks formation of the short pitch confor - mation , explaining how it inhibits nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex . Because crosslinking is blocked both in the presence or absence of activators ( Figure S3C ) , we conclude that the effect of CK - 666 is not limited to the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly but that it also inﬂuences the conformational equilibria of Arp2 / 3 alone or Arp2 / 3 complex bound to GST - VCA . The same crosslinking assay could not be used to directly test if CK - 869 affects formation of the short pitch dimer , because CK - 869 does not inhibit ScArp2 / 3 complex ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) . However , the crosslinking data for CK - 666 indicate that confor - mational differences in the 2 : 2 : 1 assembly detected by AUC are caused by a failure to adopt the short pitch conformation . CK - 869 had a similar inﬂuence on the complex as CK - 666 in the AUC experiments , suggesting CK - 869 may also prevent forma - tion of the short pitch dimer . We used the structure of the com - plex with CK - 869 and ATP bound to investigate this hypothesis . Overlaying the structure onto Arp3 from the electron tomography branch junction model showed that CK - 869 - induced changes in Arp3 did not affect the short pitch interface . However , in this model , the centers of mass of Arp2 and Arp3 are 46 . 8 A˚ apart and share only (cid:1) 25 A ˚ 2 of buried surface area ( Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , in the recently published (cid:1) 8 A ˚ cryo - EM struc - ture of an actin ﬁlament , the centers of mass of two short pitch actin monomers are separated by only 40 . 6 A ˚ ( Murakami et al . , 2010 ) and share 817 A ˚ 2 of buried surface area . In this structure , the b 7 / a C loop and the sensor loop contact the a E / a F loop from the actin monomer in the short pitch position ( Figure 5I ) . These contacts require the b 7 / a C loop to bend downward toward the barbed end relative to its position in actin monomer structures ( Murakami et al . , 2010 ) . When we superimposed Arp2 and CK - 869 - bound Arp3 onto this structure , we found that the b 7 / a C loop in Arp3 sterically clashes with the a E / a F loop in Arp2 ( Fig - ure 5I ) . Together with the AUC data , these models suggest that the conformational changes in the sensor and b 7 / a C loop caused by CK - 869 may disrupt the short pitch interface of Arp2 and Arp3 . Therefore , our data are consistent with a model in which CK - 869 inhibits the Arp2 / 3 complex by destabilizing the short pitch conformation . DISCUSSION CK - 666 and CK - 869 Use Distinct Structural Mechanisms to Inhibit Arp2 / 3 Complex : Implications for Inhibiting Protein - Protein Interactions Here , we demonstrate that CK - 666 inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex by blocking formation of the short pitch Arp2 - Arp3 dimer . The structural basis for this conformational control by CK - 666 is evident in X - ray crystal structures , which showed that CK - 666 stabilizes the splayed conformation by contacting residues from Arp3 and Arp2 that are aligned only in the inactive state ( Baggett et al . , 2012 ) . Our data show that this stabilization is sufﬁcient to block formation of the short pitch dimer , thereby inhibiting the complex . Binding of CK - 666 requires only minor side chain movements , so CK - 666 inhibits by trapping a native inactive conformation of the complex . Analogous trapping mechanisms are commonly used by naturally occurring allo - steric inhibitors , but there are relatively few examples of syn - thetic compounds that exploit serendipitous allosteric sites for conformational trapping ( Hardy and Wells , 2004 ; Lee and Craik , 2009 ) . These results raise the intriguing possibility that other serendipitous sites on Arp2 / 3 complex might be exploited to lock it into the short pitch conformation , providing a tool for investigating both the mechanistic details of activation and in vivo function of the complex . Our data suggest that CK - 869 also blocks formation of the short pitch dimer . While CK - 666 accomplishes this by stabilizing the splayed conformation , CK - 869 appears to destabilize the short pitch interface of Arp2 and Arp3 . Interestingly , it does not bind to and directly blocks one side of this protein - protein inter - face ( PPI ) , the typical mode of action for PPI inhibitors ( Wilson , 2009 ) . Instead , it indirectly disrupts two key loops at the interface by binding to a pocket near the PPI that normally anchors one of the loops ( Figure 6A ) . These results highlight the importance of using computational methods that incorporate loop ﬂexibility into computational screening ( B - Rao et al . , 2009 ) , even in cases where surface loops are well - ordered and appear to be locked into place in crystal structures , as observed for the sensor loop in Arp3 structures without CK - 869 ( Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ) . Un - covering such serendipitous pockets near other important PPIs could provide a general way to circumvent the problems inherent in directly targeting the extensive and relatively ﬂat surfaces typical of PPIs ( Wells and McClendon , 2007 ) .

Our data provide several important insights into the relationship between activation and conformation . First , binding of VCA alone is not sufﬁcient to lock the complex into the short pitch dimer conformation . Crosslinking assays showed that NPF alone does not completely shift the equilibrium to the short pitch state , since actin monomers were required to maximize formation of crosslinked Arp2 - Arp3 dimer . The extent to which an NPF alone can promote the conformational change may depend on multiple factors , including whether it engages one or both sites and on the species of Arp2 / 3 complex . For instance , our crosslinking data demonstrated that GST - VCA increased the population of the short pitch state over no NPF in the budding yeast complex . In contrast , the ﬂuorescence anisotropy binding data show binding of monomeric VCA to the bovine complex is not inﬂuenced by the inhibitors , so VCA cannot cause the short pitch dimer conformation to be signiﬁ - cantly populated , since this would result in thermodynamic microirreversibility . A precise understanding of the relationship between NPF binding and the conformation of the complex will be critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of regulation of the complex . Second , our crosslinking data demonstrate that actin mono - mers stimulate formation of the short pitch Arp2 - Arp3 dimer . While previous data showed the V region of VCA is required for activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WASp / Scar family proteins ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) , whether actin monomers are recruited to the complex solely to bypass slow formation of an Arp2 - Arp3 - actin hetero - oligomer or if they play a direct role in activating the complex has been uncertain . Small - angle X - ray scattering data showed that VCA recruits the ﬁrst actin mono - mer to the barbed end of Arp2 ( Boczkowska et al . , 2008 ) . Steric clash prevents the second actin from being delivered to the barbed end of Arp3 when the complex is in the splayed confor - mation ( Figure 6B ; Padrick et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , the barbed end of Arp3 is exposed in the short pitch conformation , leading ( I ) Model showing structural basis for inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex by CK - 869 .

CK - 869 binding locks the sensor loop in an open conformation , and the b 7 / a C loop moves toward subdomain 2 ( middle panel ) . This structural change destabilizes theArp3 - Arp2 short pitch interface , because the b 7 / a C loop of Arp3 clashes with the a E / a F loop of Arp2 in the short pitch position . In contrast , CK - 666 stabilizes the splayed conformation of Arp2 / 3 complex by binding to the interface of Arp2 and Arp3 in the inactive conformation ( right panel ) . ( B ) Simpliﬁed potential reaction pathway for Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Steps affected by CK - 666 and CK - 869 and highlighted and the hypoth - esized conformational state of the complex at each step are depicted . ATP binding causes cleft closure in Arp3 ( Nolen et al . , 2004 ) , and VCA binding causes a compaction or closure of the entire complex ( Goley et al . , 2004 ; Rodal et al . , 2005 ) , which we depict here as a reordering and closure of subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp2 from the disordered ( dotted line ) state observed in inactive Arp2 / 3 complex crystal structures . The switch from the splayed to short pitch conformation in - volves a (cid:1) 25 A˚ movement of Arp2 , which exposes the barbed end of Arp3 for interaction with a VCA - tethered actin monomer . This conformational change is stimulated by VCA - recruited actin monomers and blocked by both CK - 666 and CK - 869 . Chemistry & Biology Mechanism of Arp2 / 3 Complex Inhibitors Chemistry & Biology 20 , 701 – 712 , May 23 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 709 to the hypothesis that delivery of actin to Arp3 and binding of CA cooperatively induce the short pitch conformation ( Boczkowska et al . , 2008 ; Padrick et al . , 2011 ) . Our data strongly support this model , and the crosslinking assay reported here will allow us to directly test requirements for forming the short pitch dimer , including recruitment of single versus two VCA actins to the complex . Third , our data demonstrate that binding of the complex to actin ﬁlaments is not required to stimulate the short pitch confor - mation . Actin ﬁlaments are required for Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate a ﬁlament ( Achard et al . , 2010 ; Higgs et al . , 1999 ) , so our data suggest that formation of the short pitch dimer is not sufﬁcient for nucleation . One possibility is that the V region of VCA blocks the barbed end of actin subunits in the 2 : 2 : 1 assem - bly ( Chereau et al . , 2005 ; Padrick et al . , 2011 ) and that binding of the assembly to actin ﬁlaments is required for release of VCA ( Figure 6B ) . While this model is consistent with experiments that suggest that VCA is released from branch junctions ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Martin et al . , 2006 ) , additional experiments will be required to test this model . One unexpected result of this work is that neither inhibitor inﬂuenced binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex to the pointed end of preformed actin ﬁlaments . Pointed end binding has been hy - pothesized to shift the conformational equilibrium of the com - plex to favor the short pitch dimer ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ; LeClaire et al . , 2008 ) . Our data suggest that the complex re - mains splayed when bound to the pointed end . Because the barbed end of Arp3 is blocked in the splayed conformation , we speculate that the barbed end of Arp2 mediates interactions with the pointed end and that this interaction is sufﬁcient to shift the nucleotide cleft of Arp2 into a hydrolysis - competent confor - mation ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ) . We note that the failure of Arp2 / 3 complex to adopt the short pitch conformation at the pointed end is consistent with a recent high - resolution cryoelec - tron microscopy structure , which shows that the terminal pointed end actin subunit is titled and does not form the canon - ical short pitch dimer with the penultimate actin subunit ( Narita et al . , 2011 ) . Implications for Understanding Inﬂuence of Inhibitors on In Vivo Branched Actin Networks The molecular mechanism of each inhibitor has important impli - cations for interpreting its inﬂuence on branched actin networks in vivo . For instance , we have shown that the inhibitors do not stimulate dissociation of preformed branches in vitro . Therefore , the rate of disassembly of in vivo actin networks upon treat - ment with the inhibitors reﬂects the rate of turnover of Arp2 / 3 - branched networks in the absence of inhibitors . Second , we showed that the inhibitors block the nucleation activity of the complex without altering its other biochemical activities . This functional speciﬁcity has advantages over genetic ablation methods , considering that knockout or knockdowns of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits result in destabilization and often complete loss of the complex ( Gournier et al . , 2001 ) . For example , neither inhibitor signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced NPF binding , indicating that the inhibitors will not affect NPF - dependent localization of the complex in vivo . Therefore , both inhibitors will be useful in inves - tigating the recruitment of Arp2 / 3 complex to sites of actin network initiation in the absence of branching nucleation . SIGNIFICANCE Here , we use biochemical and structural methods to dissect the mechanism of Arp2 / 3 complex by small molecules CK - 666 and CK - 869 . This work provides several important insights into the relationship between conformation and activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We show that actin mono - mers recruited by WASp - VCA stimulate the short pitch conformation of the complex without requiring binding of the complex to the sides of actin ﬁlaments , as previously posited . Future mechanistic studies will be aimed at how binding to actin ﬁlaments is coupled to activation so that the complex creates only branched actin ﬁlament networks . By demonstrating that the inhibitors do not inﬂuence the interaction of the complex with NPFs , ATP , or actin ﬁlaments nor cause active disassembly of preformed branches , we provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the in - ﬂuence of the inhibitors on actin networks in vivo . Finally , by dissecting the structural / biochemical mechanisms of two distinct inhibitors of the Arp2 / 3 complex , this work pro - vides a conceptual basis for understanding how to inhibit protein - protein interaction in macromolecular assemblies .
