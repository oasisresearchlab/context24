BIOPHYSICS LETTER Fabien Gerbal Æ Vale´rie Laurent Æ Albrecht Ott Marie - France Carlier Æ Paul Chaikin Æ Jacques Prost Measurement of the elasticity of the actin tail of Listeriamonocytogenes Received : 13 October 1999 / Revised version : 14 January 2000 / Accepted : 18 January 2000 Abstract We report biophysical experiments performed on the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes , a model sys - tem to study actin - based motility . Using optical tweezers and electrophoresis experiments , we ﬁnd that the bac - terium is ﬁrmly attached to its tail , and we demonstrate that the tail responds as an elastic gel when deformed . We have measured its elastic modulus at a value of 10 3 – 10 4 Pa , which is 10 times higher than the rigidity of the eukaryotic cytoplasm . These results demonstrate that the bacterium and its tail form a very robust system , consistent with the steadyness of the motion observed in vivo . We propose an elastic model for the propulsion mechanism which takes into account the connection and thus the interaction between the actin ﬁlaments . It pro - vides a generic description of the various aspects of ac - tin - tail based movements . Key words Listeria monocytogenes Æ Cell motility Æ Actin gel Æ Elasticity Æ Optical tweezers Æ Cell mechanics Introduction Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium which induces actin polymerization at its surface ( Tilney and Portnoy 1989 ; Southwick and Purich 1996 ) . It creates a long tail of cross - linked actin gel used as a sca(cid:128)olding to propel itself through the cytoplasm and the membranes of infected cells ( Theriot et al . 1992 ) . This is one of the simplest systems whose motion shares many features with eukaryotic cell motility ( Friedrich et al . 1995 ) . A detailed description of the molecular agents ( Kocks et al . 1995 ; Welch et al . 1998 ) involved in its displace - ment has been facilitated by the reconstitution of Lis - teria motility in cell - free extract medium [ cytoplasm of Xenopus eggs ( Theriot et al . 1994 ) or of blood platelets ( Carlier et al . 1997 ) ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Many models suggest how the polymerization of actin monomers is biochemically achieved ( Marchand et al . 1995 ; Southwick and Purich 1998 ) . No ATPase proteins like myosins have been found to be involved ( Dabiri et al . 1990 ; Mounier et al . 1990 ; Marchand et al . 1995 ) , and actin polymerization alone is thought to account for the Listeria motion ( Mitchison and Cramer 1996 ) . Only Oster et al . have proposed a quantitative predictive model ( Peskin et al . 1993 ; Mogilner and Oster 1996 ) explaining how the actin polymerization produces forces driving Listeria or ex - tending lamellipodia at the leading edge of motile cells . In this paper , we present the ﬁrst quantitative mea - surements of the elasticity of the Listeria actin tail . Our results provide a basis to estimate the intensity of the forces propelling the bacterium owing to actin poly - merization .

Then 1 l l of a sus - pension of 1 . 909 l m diameter latex beads ( Polyscience ) at (cid:24) 10 9 beads / ml was added . Then 5 l l of this solution was placed between a slide and a coverslip coated with bovine serum albumin , the sample was sealed with su - perglue , and movement was observed using a phase contrast Plan - Neoﬂuar 100X / 1 . 3 oil objective ( Zeiss ) in an inverted microscope ( Zeiss Axiovert 135 ) . The tem - perature was set to 35 (cid:139) 0 . 5 (cid:176) C . The images obtained from a gray level CCD Sony camera were recorded with a S - VHS videorecorder . Optical tweezer set - up Our tweezers ( Ashkin and Dziedzic 1986 ) were set up as described by Svoboda and Block ( 1994 ) . We used a YAG Spectra Physics laser ( model 7300 , k (cid:136) 1064 nm , maximum power 600 mW , mode T 00 ) . The beam was ﬁrst deﬂected by two mirrors on a galvanometer posi - tioning system ( 650 · from Cambridge Technology ) and passed through a 2 . 5 · beam expander before being fo - cused through the objective . The geometry was such that an elementary angular displacement of the galvanome - ters moved the tweezer by 20 nm . The main beam could be split into two or three traps by controlling the mirrors with a 100 Hz square periodic function . We calibrated the maximum force a tweezer could apply on a latex bead versus the power of the laser . The beads were dragged trough a 12 % glycerol in water solution having the same refraction index as our motility medium ( 1 . 347 (cid:139) 0 . 001 ) and a known viscosity of 1 . 23 · 10 ) 3 Pa s ( measured in a Brookﬁeld conic Cou - ette viscosimeter ) . The frequency of a sinusoidal dis - placement ( added to the multi - trap function ) was increased until the bead was dragged out of the trap when the Stokes force ( F (cid:136) 6 pg RV ) equaled the optical force . For multiple trapping , we checked each trap in - dependently and found a dispersion less than 2 % in - duced by the variation of the laser intensity with position . The calibrated force was linear with the laser power for slow displacements ( when the displacement period is long compared to the multi - trap function pe - riod ) . Since in our experiments the beads escaped at such a low speed from the traps , measurements at low laser power were linearly extrapolated to obtain the full cal - ibration curve . The viscosity of the motility medium was measured by comparing the viscous drag on a bead with the optical force and found to be 0 . 03 (cid:139) 0 . 01 Pa s . The force exerted by a single trap tweezer on a bacterium was evaluated following the same protocol and found to be about 10 pN . Optical scissors We used a Spectra Physics argon laser ( model Stabilite 2017 ) focused through the objective to cut Listeria tails . We found that 10 s of continuous illumination with 200 mW of radiation between 411 and 514 nm triggered the disintegration of the tail in 5 – 30 s on a scale of 1 l m or less . The cuts , even as close as 2 l m from a bacterium , did not a(cid:128)ect the growth of the tails from the bacterium surface . Sticking beads on the tail We used 1 . 909 l m Polyscience carboxylate latex spheres on which functional myosin II puriﬁed from chicken breast muscles were covalently bound . The beads were manipulated within the Listeria solution under the mi - croscope with the optical tweezer and stuck close to a tail . To avoid competition between actin ﬁlaments of the tail with free actin monomers in bulk ( which leads to the release of the bead ) , we strongly irradiated the bead with 200 mW argon laser light at 514 nm to block the myosin in the strong binding state . After such treatment the beads remained stuck for minutes and never detached from the tail when pulled away with the tweezer , until the usual depolymerization of the tail released the bead . We were able to stick beads on the tail as close as 3 l m to a bacterium without changing its behavior . Electrophoresis experiment The electric ﬁeld set - up used a design as described by Mitnik et al . ( 1995 ) . The force was calibrated by mea - suring the ﬁeld which would pull a free bacterium out of an optical trap ( this measure takes into account the drag due to the electro - osmosis ﬂow ) . The intensity of the ﬁeld was limited to about 10 4 V m ) 1 , as higher ﬁeld would generate too much heat in the sample . Fig . 1 Phase contrast images of Listeria with their tails in 90 % platelets cytosol extract and 10 % Xenopus extract . Platelets high - speed supernatants do not contain vesicles and are suitable for experiments with optical tweezers . The addition of Xenopus extract increases the percentage of motile bacteria . The speed increases exponentially with temperature . At 35 (cid:176) C , Listeria moved at 9 . 2 (cid:139) 0 . 17 l m / min ( 18 measurements ) and the depolymerization time was about 5 – 10 min , so that tails could be more than 100 l m long . L . monocytogenes can grow helix - shaped tails ( here , they adhere to the surface ) with a constant curvature over more than 50 l m . Bars are 5 l m long 135 Elastic measurements analysis The images of the deformed tails were digitized from videotape using a Macintosh with a Scion Image Grabbers card and NIH Image software . The analysis was done on the last frame before a bead broke free of the trap , at which point the tweezers apply their maxi - mum force and the experimental accuracy is best . To deﬁne the tail shape , 10 – 30 dots were plotted on the image . The ﬁts of the theoretical shapes to the experi - mental tail shapes were done by the minimization of v 2 . Results Our ﬁrst experiments involved semi - quantitative mea - surements of the interaction between Listeria and its tail . Listeria were studied in 6 l l of cell - free extract motility medium . In Fig . 2a and b the bacterium is held by an optical trap , and the sample cell is translated either along the tail - bacterium axis ( a ) or perpendicularly to it ( b ) . This creates a viscous drag on the tail intended to pull it away from the bacterium . In both experiments the bacterium broke free of the optical trap before any separation with its tail could be seen , regardless of the length of the tail , which could be cut at various distances from the bacterium . These experiments show that the bacterium is bound to its tail by interactions stronger than 10 pN , the force exerted by the trap on a bacterium . This is about 1000 times larger than the viscous drag experienced by a moving bacterium in the extract . In another experiment ( not shown ) , the tail is bound to a polystyrene bead attached to the cover slip . An electric ﬁeld of 10 4 V m ) 1 is then applied which pulls the bac - terium with a force of about 1 pN ( deduced by com - parison with the force of the optical tweezer ) during a time scale of 2 min . This is not su(cid:129)cient to pull the bacterium away from its tail ( the relative displacement is less than half a micron ) , and there is no obvious increase in the Listeria ’s speed . We conclude that either the ﬁla - ments are temporarily bound to the bacterium , or that there is a steric hindrance to their motion ( they are en - tangled in the bacterial wall , for instance ) . Thus , the experiments provide a lower boundary for an e(cid:128)ective friction coe(cid:129)cient n between the tail and the bacterium surface : n > 1 pN / ( 0 . 5 l m / 120 s ) (cid:136) 2 · 10 ) 4 Pa m s . The connection between Listeria and its tail is an unexpected result as the Brownian ratchet model ( Peskin et al . 1993 ; Mogilner and Oster 1996 , 1999 ) suggests the ﬁlaments are only pushing on the bacterium . In another experiment , we tried to stop the bacterium with the tweezer ( Fig . 2c ) . We found that the tail , held by the bacterium at one tip and blocked at the other extremity by the viscous drag , bends because of the continuous actin polymerization . This increases the force from the tail on the bacterium until it is able to push the Listeria out of the trap . In all experiments , after the constraints are released the tails return to their original shape , showing that the deformations are elastic . To evaluate the forces felt by the bacterium for a given strain in the tail , we performed experiments to measure the elastic modulus of the tail . We used the multiple trap optical tweezer created by deﬂecting the infrared laser beam with two perpendicular mirrors mounted on computer - controlled galvanometers which we oscillated between two or three positions . We stuck beads onto the tails and pulled on them until the bending forces of the tail exceeded the optical force . Depending on whether the tails were straight or curved , we used di(cid:128)erent geometries . For straight tails ( Fig . 3a ) , we attached three beads at an equal spacing of about 10 l m ( within the observation ﬁeld ) . At ﬁrst , the beam was split into three traps , catching the three beads in Fig . 2a – c L . monocytogenes is attached to its elastic tail . a , b The bacterium is held by the optical tweezer while the microscope stage is moved ( the thick arrows indicate the direction of displacement ) . a ( 0 s ) The tail has been cut with optical scissors , and the severed part of the tail moves away from the trapped bacterium ( 1 . 014 ) . As the speed increases , the viscous force on the remaining attached tail pulls Listeria out of the tweezer ( 1 . 890 ) . The bacterium still induces the growth of the tail after a cut by laser irradiation ( 75 . 000 ) . b A similar experiment is performed , but with a translation perpendicular to the tail axis : a torque is exerted about the bacterium - tail contact . The angle between the bacterium and the tail does not change , but the tail bends ( 0 . 4 ) . As further stress builds up with further displacement , the elastic force pushes the Listeria out of the trap ( 0 . 8 ) . Finally , the tail recovers its initial shape ( 4 . 4 ) , showing that the distortion was completely elastic . c A Listeria with a growing tail ( 0 ) is simply caught in the tweezer ( 10 ) . Continued growth leads to a bending of the tail ( 20 ) until the elastic stress is su(cid:129)cient to push the Listeria out of the trap . Then , the tails relaxes elastically ( 32 ) . Tweezers are indicated by cross - shaped markers . Numbers indicate time in seconds . Bars (cid:136) 2 l m 136 their equilibrium position . We then displaced ( using 20 nm steps ) the central trap perpendicularly to the axis deﬁned by the two other traps . This was done until one of the beads escaped from the trap ( this was always the central bead , thus showing the dominance of bending forces over stretching ; tension would have pulled out one of the side beads ﬁrst ) . For curved tails ( Fig . 3b ) , we attached only two beads at the extremity of a 10 – 30 l m long section that was then cut o(cid:128) from the rest of the tail using optical scissors ( see Materials and methods ) . Then , each bead was trapped by a tweezer and one was moved in the direction of the other until one of the beads ( not always the one displaced by the tweezer ) escaped from its trap . The experiments were repeated an average of ﬁve times before the depolymerization of the tail caused one of the beads to detach . The maximum force the multiple tweezers could apply on a 2 l m diameter microsphere ( in the range of 1 pN ) was previously calibrated by comparison with the known Stokes force due to viscous drag . The digitized images of the tail were ﬁtted with the theoretical shape of a bent rod ( Landau and Lifchitz 1967 ) made of iso - tropic and homogeneous elastic material . The average standard deviation between the ﬁt function and the dot positions on the real tail ( see Materials and methods ) were found to be less than 0 . 1 l m for 92 of 105 mea - surements , indicating that the elastic model was suitable . The 13 other measurements were not included in the data since the tails did not bend homogeneously : under tension , their shape presented some kinks , suggesting that some loose parts of the gel had broken . For curved tails , left and right sides were analyzed separately to account for the natural curvature variations ( (cid:24) 10 % ) and gave essentially the same rigidity . The rigidity of the tail decays with time as the actin depolymerizes ( Fig . 4a ) . However , the tails were probed on distances ( 10 – 30 l m ) such that sti(cid:128)ness variations due to the de - polymerization could be neglected [ the decay distance is typically 100 l m ( Figs . 1 , 4a ) ] . The mean value of the bending modulus K of each Listeria tail is plotted on Fig . 4b and ranges from 100 to 1000 Pa ( l m ) 4 , i . e . the persistence length of the tail is in the range of a meter . This natural dispersion is directly seen by the very dif - fering gray intensities of the phase contrast images of the tails , and is found to be the same for curved and straight tails . The log - normal distribution of the rigidity indi - cates that many probabilistic events are involved in the making of a tail . By comparison , the distribution of the bacterium’s speed does not show such variability . Our theoretical analysis explains this result ( Gerbal 1999 ) . No in vitro viscoelastic measurements have been performed on actin gels at concentrations higher than 50 l M . According to theoretical scaling laws ( MacK - Fig . 3a , b Video images of bending experiments . Measurements of the bending modulus of straight tails ( a ) and naturally curved tails ( b ) . In both sequences the ﬁrst frame is the last image before a bead escapes from the tweezer , when the elastic force equals the optical force . The tails then relax to their initial equilibrium position from which they have been deformed . Bars are 2 l m long and times are in seconds . Tweezers are indicated by cross - shaped markers 137 intosh et al . 1995 ) , an estimate of the elastic moduli of isotropic actin gels is : G ¢ (cid:24) c 2 . 2 (cid:24) 10 5 Pa , where c is the concentration found in the Listeria tail [ in the millimolar range from freeze fracture micrographs ( Sechi et al . 1997 ) ] . This gives a rigidity of K big (cid:136) G 0 (cid:133) p = 4 (cid:134) r 4 (cid:24) 10 5 Pa ( l m ) 4 , where r (cid:24) 0 : 5 l m is the radius of the tail . In the extreme alternative view , the tail is made of bundles of axial ﬁlaments able to glide on each other ; this leads to a rigidity K small (cid:136) nK f (cid:24) 15 Pa ( l m ) 4 where K f (cid:24) 6 · 10 ) 2 Pa ( l m ) 4 is the bending modulus of a single ﬁlament ( Riveline et al . 1997 ) and n (cid:24) 200 is the number of ﬁlaments per tail section . Our measure of K falls right between these values , suggesting either that the cross - links are not very rigid or that the tail is not homogeneous , in agreement with Sechi et al . ( 1997 ) and Zhukarev et al . ( 1995 ) . Moreover , our measured values of Young’s modulus of E (cid:136) K / ( p / 4 ) r 4 (cid:136) 10 3 – 10 4 Pa are consistent with recent experiments ( Thoumine and Ott 1997 ) which showed that living chick ﬁbroblasts have an elastic response to deformation in the range of 600 – 1000 Pa . It is reasonable that Listeria assembles a tail which is about 10 times stronger than the cytoskeleton through which it needs to move . Our measure of K im - plies that the tail must be entangled in the cytoplasm of an infected cell to be able to push on its membrane . The bacterium requires about 50 pN to deform a eukaryotic membrane ( Evans and Yeung 1989 ) . Such a force would buckle a long tail ( as in Fig . 2c ) . It must be held straight by the host cytoskeleton over a distance ( p / 2 ) (cid:214) ( K / F applied ) ’ 5 l m ( Landau and Lifchitz 1967 ) . Discussion The quantitative experimental demonstration that the tail is a genuine gel ﬁrmly attached to the bacterium is not a simple conﬁrmation of an already well - known feature . It implies that some ﬁlaments might be pulling at the same time as others are pushing on the bacterium sur - face , though all are connected in the gel . This shows that the interactions between the ﬁlaments are playing an important role in the propulsion of the bacterium . Thus , the Listeria motion cannot be deduced directly from the understanding of the biochemistry of an elementary protein set : a further analysis considering the collective behavior of the many proteins involved is also required . In the following we present a mesoscopic model of the Listeria , treating the gel as a continuous elastic medium ( Fig . 5 ) . Using the measurement of the tail elasticity , it provides directly an estimate of the forces driving the Listeria . A complete analysis of this model will be pre - sented elsewhere ( article in preparation ) . Consider the growth of an actin gel from the surface of a sphere . As new gel pushes old gel outward , the outer regions stretch and exert a compressive stress inward . As the gel grows , the force on the inner surface increases until actin polymerization is no longer energetically fa - vorable . Precisely this cessation of growth has recently been observed in vitro for actin polymerization on beads ( Cameron et al . 1999 ; Gerbal et al . 1999 ) and also for some Listeria mutants ( Lasa et al . 1997 ) . In the case of the wild - type Listeria , the elastic tension is su(cid:129)ciently released as the gel moves from the curved surface to the linear tail . In this model , the least energetic conﬁgura - tion of the gel accounts for the tail shape and the bac - terium motion . In our model , the external part of the gel ( light gray on Fig . 5 ) and the internal part ( dark gray ) are treated independently at ﬁrst before dealing with the full system . Consider a bacterium producing only an ‘‘external’’ gel by actin polymerization on its cylindrical surface [ con - focal microscopy observations showed that the Shigella ﬂexneri tail is hollow ( P . Cossart , personal communi - cation ) ; also Merriﬁeld et al . have found the same result for internal vesicles propelled by an actin tail ( unpub - lished data ) ] . The outward growth produces a normal stress on the bacterium side r (cid:24) E ( d / r ) 2 ( where E is the tail Young’s modulus , d the gel thickness , and r the bacterium radius ) . As the gel slips o(cid:128) the back , it pushes the bacterium with an elastic force F (cid:24) E d 3 / r . From our Fig . 4a , b Graphs of the bending modulus of Listeria tails . a Bending modulus ( K ) of two Listeria tails versus time ( t ) ; one straight tail ( r ) and one curved tail [ gray dots represent its left ( d ) and right ( n ) sides ] . Each set of data is ﬁtted to A exp ( – time / s ) ( continuous and dashed lines ) , giving decay times s (cid:24) 7 , 6 , 3 min , respectively , consistent with the depolymerization time of tails . b Distribution on a log scale of Listeria ’s tail - bending modulus ( K ) . Clear bars represent six curved tails ( left and right sides ) and dark bars represent 13 straight tails 138 measured value of E , F is in the range of 1 nN . This propulsive force is several orders of magnitude larger than the largest external force acting on a bacterium infecting a cell ( about 50 pN ) , or than the force required to propel a bacterium through our extract ( 10 ) 15 N ! ) ( see Materials and methods ) . The driving force F must therefore be balanced internally . Consistent with our ﬁnding that the tail and the bacterium are linked , the opposing force must be provided either by the surface friction of the gel on the bacterium , or by a tension imposed by the ‘‘internal’’ part of the gel pro - duced at the back hemisphere . The strength of these forces relative to what is required for propulsion pro - vides the steady speed of the bacteria observed in vivo : if the bacterium encounters obstacles such as cell mem - branes , a small compression of the elastic tail supplies the required amount of propulsive force . It is a self - adjustable mechanism . Together with the demonstra - tions of the attachment of the bacterium to its ‘‘engine’’ , it shows that the tail - Listeria system is very robust , a requirement for infecting and moving through the eukaryote cytoplasm . In this article , we have demonstrated the tail of Lis - teria monocytogenes is elastic . The measured value of 10 3 – 10 4 Pa for the Young’s modulus – higher than what could be accounted for by the bending of independent ﬁlaments – is a direct demonstration that the tail is a cohesive gel , as was previously suggested by the ﬁnding of cross - linking proteins in it ( Dabiri et al . 1990 ) . These experiments provide pieces of evidence that the elasticity of the tail plays a key role in the physics of the motion : the free energy produced by the actin polymerization is used to deform the actin gel as a ﬁrst step rather than producing directly the propulsive force . We propose an elastic model of the propulsion showing that the tail exerts a complex stress whose direction and strength vary along the bacterium surface , a result that cannot be obtained from a description of independent actin ﬁla - ments at a molecular scale . We are able to show in a more detailed analysis ( Gerbal 1999 ; article in prepara - tion ) that a generic actin - tail propulsion mechanism can be obtained within this elastic model , including the os - cillatory behavior observed in the ActA D 21 – 97 mutant ( Lasa et al . 1997 ) which periodically alternates between a fast and a slow motion .

The free energy from actin polymerization is stored as elastic energy in the actin gel , seen as a continuous medium . The shape of the tail ( dark and clear gray ) is dictated by the minimum energy conformation . The three ﬁgures describe the putative evolution of a new actin layer ( white ) polymerized on the surface at a given time . The evolution of the gel from a quasi - cylindrical geometry ( around the bacterium ) to a one - dimensional one ( in the tail far away ) induces strong deforma - tions in the gel , thus inducing antagonist forces on the Listeria surface ( white arrows ) . This example suggests that the external gel ( light gray ) moves faster than the internal gel ( dark gray ) , so that they are respectively producing the propulsive and retarding forces 139 Marchand JB , Moreau P , Paoletti A , Cossart P , Carlier MF , Pantaloni D ( 1995 ) Actin - based movement of Listeria mono - cytogenes : actin assembly results from the local maintenance of uncapped ﬁlament barbed ends at the bacterium surface .
