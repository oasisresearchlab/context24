All rights reserved . DOI 10 . 1016 / j . ceb . 2010 . 05 . 009 Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis can be broken down into three main steps : the clustering of coat proteins and cargo at the future endocytic site , membrane deformation , and a scission event that releases the fully formed endocytic vesicle . Many aspects of this process are evolutionarily conserved . Components of the mammalian endocytosis machinery have homologs in yeast , and two - color live - cell imaging studies have shown these proteins are recruited in a similar temporal sequence in yeast and mammals [ 1 , 2 ] . Despite these similarities , signiﬁcant differences have been noted ( for reviews see [ 3 – 5 ] ) . Clathrin adaptors such as AP - 2 that are central in linking cargo to the vesicle coat in mammals are present yet are dispensable in yeast . And while dynamin is crucial for vesicle scission in mammals , yeast dynamin - like proteins do not play a similar role [ 6 , 7 ] . Finally , actin is not absolutely required for uptake in many mammalian cell types , yet is essential for endocy - tosis in yeast . This review will highlight recent ﬁndings that address these apparent differences , with a focus on the yeast model system . Studies of the past year have uncovered cargo - speciﬁc roles for yeast clathrin adaptors , and have identiﬁed new families of conserved endocytic adaptor proteins present in yeast and man . Meanwhile , new models have been advanced to explain differences in the relative importance of actin and dynamin for vesicle scission in various systems . These studies reconcile views of endocytosis in different organisms and suggest underlying processes are fundamentally conserved . Emerging roles for cargo - speciﬁc adaptors in yeast Clathrin adaptors : AP - 2 and AP180 Given the well - established role of AP - 2 adaptors in mammalian cells , it has been perplexing that AP - 2 mutations have no discernable effect in yeast . A recent large - scale screen provides the ﬁrst indication that the yeast AP - 2 complex may in fact be important for the uptake of speciﬁc cargo [ 8 (cid:2) ] . Mutants lacking any of the four AP - 2 subunits are resistant to K28 , a virally encoded yeast killer toxin that enters cells after binding and endocytosis of an unidentiﬁed receptor . AP - 2 mutants are unable to take up toxin from the media , and because yeast AP - 2 is recruited to endocytic sites concurrent with clathrin and other early coat com - ponents , a direct role in receptor uptake seems likely . Identifying the K28 receptor and characterizing its interactions with AP - 2 will help rule out indirect effects on toxin uptake . A cargo - speciﬁc role for the yeast homologs of the clathrin adaptor complex AP180 / CALM was also uncov - ered in a genome - wide screen of yeast deletion mutants [ 9 (cid:2) ] . Cells lacking both AP180 homologs are severely defective in the uptake of the VAMP / synaptobrevin - like vSNARE Snc1 , but not other commonly studied cargo . Because AP180 mediates the uptake of synapto - brevin in worms , ﬂies , and mammals this sorting role appears to be highly conserved [ 10 – 12 ] . The signal recognized by AP180 has not been determined for any cargo , though mutation of two residues in Snc1 blocks its internalization [ 9 (cid:2) , 13 ] . It is not known if these residues form a small sorting motif or are part of a larger conformational epitope , as seen for other SNARE – adaptor interactions [ 14 ] . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010 , 22 : 513 – 518 The muniscins : a new family of mu homology domain adaptors A recent structural analysis identiﬁed yeast Syp1 and the related mammalian proteins FCHO1 / 2 and SGIP1 as members of a new family of conserved endocytic adaptor proteins with homology to the cargo - binding medium ( mu ) chain of clathrin adaptor complexes [ 15 (cid:2) ] . The Syp1 mu homology domain ( uHD ) binds directly to the candidate cargo protein Mid2 and also interacts with the endocytic scaffold protein Ede1 , which may stabilize coat formation [ 15 (cid:2) , 16 ] . In Syp1 , the uHD is separated from a membrane - binding F - BAR domain by an unstructured linker region that negatively regulates actin polymerization by inhibiting Las17 / WASP [ 15 (cid:2) , 17 (cid:2) ] . This arrangement could link cargo recruitment to vesicle budding [ 17 (cid:2) ] . The shallow curvature of the Syp1 F - BAR domain may favor associ - ation at initial stages of coat formation [ 15 (cid:2) , 18 ] . As mem - brane curvature increases , dissociation of Syp1 would activate actin assembly and further accelerate invagina - tion . The timing of Syp1 recruitment is consistent in this model : Syp1 and clathrin arrive early at endocytic sites , but unlike clathrin , Syp1 remains at the cell cortex and does not associate with the invaginating vesicle [ 16 ] . However , loss of Syp1 does not alter the progression of endocytic vesicle formation [ 16 , 17 (cid:2) ] , suggesting other actin regulatory proteins play a redundant role in vivo . The mammalian Syp1 - like proteins FCHO1 / 2 and SGIP1 are also recruited to clathrin - coated pits , have an N - terminal membrane - binding domain , and interact with the Ede1 - like protein Eps15 [ 15 (cid:2) , 16 , 19 ] . It remains to be seen if mammalian muniscin proteins have similar effects on actin assembly through the Las17 homolog WASP , which is subject to different regulatory mechanisms , including auto - inhibition . Arrestin - like proteins In mammals , clathrin associated sorting proteins often work in conjunction with clathrin adaptors [ 20 ] . For example , b - arrestins link G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) to the endocytic machinery to downregulate signaling . When b - arrestin binds a ligand - activated , phos - phorylated GPCR it undergoes a conformational change that exposes a C - terminal tail with motifs for adaptin and clathrin binding . This recruits the GPCR to clathrin - coated pits and promotes receptor endocytosis . Yeast do not have canonical arrestins , but do contain represen - tatives of a conserved family of arrestin - like proteins , the arrestin - related trafﬁcking adaptors ( ARTs ; [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 22 , 23 ] ) . ART C - terminal tails lack adaptin and clathrin - binding sequences , and instead contain PxY motifs that recruit the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Binding of ARTs to acti - vated receptors results in their ubiquitination and intern - alization . ARTs regulate the uptake of a diverse group of nutrient transporters whose expression at the cell surface is tightly controlled in response to extracellular cues [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 22 , 24 ] . A high level of a particular substrate signals clearance of its cognate transporter from the cell surface , whereas cell stress triggers uptake of many different transporters . Although ARTs can act redundantly , several have been matched to the substrate - induced uptake of speciﬁc transporters ( Table 1 ) . Surprisingly , stress signaling often involves a different ART , typically one member of the related Art2 / Art8 pair [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 24 ] . For example , Art4 regulates the glucose - induced uptake of the glucose transporter Hxt6 , whereas its stress - induced internaliz - ation is mediated by Art8 [ 24 ] . Because linking PxY motifs to the arginine transporter Can1 tail bypasses the need for Art1 [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , ARTs func - tion only as cargo - speciﬁc ubiquitin ligase adaptors and 514 Membranes and organelles Table 1 Cargo - specific endocytic adaptors in yeast Adaptor Alias Homologs Cargo Reference Mu homology domain AP - 2 complex AP - 2 complex Putative K28 receptor [ 8 (cid:2) ] SYP1 SGIP1 , FCHO1 MID2 [ 15 (cid:2) , 16 , 17 (cid:2) ] YAP1801 / 2 AP180 , CALM SNC1 [ 9 (cid:2) ] SLA1 CIN85 WSC1 , STE2 [ 34 , 51 ] Arrestin - like ART1 LDB19 , CVS7 Mammalian ADC proteins CAN1 , LYP1 , MUP1 [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] ART2 ECM21 LYP1 * , SMF1 * [ 21 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 22 ] ART3 ALY2 ART4 ROD1 HXT6 [ 24 ] ART5 YGR068C ITR1 [ 24 ] ART6 ALY1 ART7 ROG3 ART8 CSR2 SMF1 * , HXT6 * [ 22 , 24 ] ART9 RIM8 RIM21 [ 52 ] ART10 YLR392C BUL1 / 2 GAP1 , CTR1 [ 25 ] * Stress - stimulated uptake .

The ubiquitin ligase adaptor Bul1 can act alone or redundantly with ARTs to mediate transporter uptake [ 24 – 26 ] . Interestingly , N - terminal domains in Bul1 and arrestins are members of a larger ‘Arrestin N - like’ clan [ 24 , 27 ] . Thus , the number of proteins distantly related to arrestins that act as ubiquitin ligase adaptors during endocytosis may be greater than currently recognized . How do ARTs recognize activated cargo ? Phosphoryl - ation is important , but not sufﬁcient , for ART binding to the metal transporter Smf1 [ 22 ] . Nikko and Pelham have speculated that signaling releases transporters from mem - brane microdomains , allowing them to access both arrest - ins and the endocytic machinery [ 24 ] . In fact , addition of its substrate releases Can1 from ergosterol - dependent clusters that are distinct from sites of endocytosis [ 28 ] , and mutations that disrupt formation of these clusters trigger Can1 endocytosis . It will be interesting to deter - mine if this requires Art1 . Further studies are needed to clarify the determinants recognized by ARTs and related ubiquitin adaptors , and to understand how different stimuli confer regulation by distinct ARTs . Other classes of membrane cargo may also require ARTs for internalization ; the pheromone receptor Ste2 is a GPCR that requires phosphorylation and ubi - quitination for uptake yet does not recruit Rsp5 directly [ 29 ] . The arrestin - like ART proteins are similar to arrest - ins in many ways , yet b - arrestins lack PxY motifs , and must use different mechanisms to recruit ubiquitin ligases [ 30 ] . These PxY motifs are conserved in mammal ART homologs , the ADC ( arrestin domain containing ) proteins , and it will be interesting to determine if mam - malian ADCs have conserved roles as ubiquitin ligase adaptors for receptor uptake . Ubiquitin - binding adaptors If arrestin - like proteins are important only for addition of the ubiquitin signal , how is the signal recognized by the endocytic machinery ? Three coat components , the epsins Ent1 and Ent2 and the Eps15 - like scaffold protein Ede1 , have ubiquitin - binding domains ( UBDs ) believed to recruit ubiquitinated cargo [ 31 ] . Live - cell imaging shows that the pheromone receptor Ste2 moves to preexisting clathrin - coated pits after ligand binding and ubiquitina - tion , and this clustering depends on Ent1 , Ent2 , and Ede1 [ 29 ] . Surprisingly , mutations that remove these UBDs while leaving other portions of these proteins intact do not prevent Ste2 uptake [ 32 ] , arguing against an obliga - tory role in cargo recognition . It is likely these UBDs contribute to coated pit assembly [ 32 ] , and that other proteins participate in recruitment of ubiquitinated cargo . The SH3 domains from several endocytic proteins , in - cluding the clathrin adaptor Sla1 and its mammalian homolog CIN85 , bind ubiquitin in vitro [ 33 ] and may serve as ubiquitin adaptors . The in vivo relevance of SH3 - ubiquitin interactions for yeast endocytosis remains to be demonstrated in vivo . However , it is interesting to note that the SHD1 domain of Sla1 , which interacts with cargo containing an NPFxD signal , has an SH3 - like fold [ 34 , 35 ] . How many more ? These studies have revealed unexpected diversity in the number of cargo - speciﬁc adaptors involved in yeast endo - cytosis . The functional importance of yeast proteins related to AP - 2 , AP180 and arrestins is clear , although few of the corresponding cargo proteins have been ident - iﬁed , and their internalization signals have not yet been mapped . Large - scale functional screens directed at additional cargo proteins may yet uncover new adaptor families , although exhaustive identiﬁcation of all possible cargo - speciﬁc sorting proteins will be difﬁcult . Additional work will also be needed to determine if all cargo - speciﬁc uptake requires clathrin , or if endocytic adaptors link to other components of the vesicle coat . Reconciling different requirements for actin and dynamin Essential requirement for actin in yeast The apparent differences between yeast and mammalian endocytosis extend to the invagination and scission reac - tions . Although a burst of actin polymerization precedes vesicle ﬁssion in mammalian cells as it does in yeast , inhibitor studies suggest actin is not absolutely required for the budding of clathrin - coated vesicles in most cell types [ 36 , 37 , 38 (cid:2) ] . Why , then , is actin so important for invagination and scission in yeast ? The answer may have to do with the turgor pressure present in yeast cells , which provides an outwardly directed force on the plasma mem - brane . Actin polymerization has been proposed to gen - erate additional force that counteracts this pressure . In support of this model , increasing turgor pressure has recently been shown to hinder endocytosis , whereas reducing the pressure difference suppresses the intern - alization defects of actin - bundling mutants and cells treated with the actin de - polymerizing drug Latrunculin A [ 39 (cid:2) ] . Interestingly , large clathrin - coated plaques found on the basal surface of adherent mammalian cells also require actin for their internalization [ 38 (cid:2) ] . It is tempting to speculate that in these cells actin polymerization over - comes the adhesive forces that anchor the basal mem - brane to the substrate [ 40 ] . Role of actin and dynamin in generating morphological differences Endocytic structures in yeast and mammals are also morphologically distinct ( Figure 1 ) . In yeast , endocytic invaginations are wide - necked ( 30 – 50 nm ) tubules cov - ered by BAR - domain proteins , surrounded by an actin matrix , and coated with clathrin only at the tip [ 41 ] . By contrast , mammalian cells display round , clathrin - coated Converging views of endocytosis in yeast and mammals Conibear 515 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010 , 22 : 513 – 518 budding proﬁles that are attached to the membrane by narrow necks and have much less associated actin . Recent work suggests dynamin could be responsible for these morphological differences [ 42 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Cells lacking both dyna - min 1 and 2 accumulate long clathrin - capped tubular structures enriched for actin and F - BAR proteins strik - ingly similar to those in yeast [ 42 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] ( Figure 1 ) . When dynamin is present , scission may happen too quickly for high levels of actin to accumulate . Conversely , in yeast , the absence of dynamin could allow prolonged actin polymerization and the formation of tubular structures . This suggests that , despite the different appearance of endocytic proﬁles in yeast and mammals , the underlying processes that regulate invagination are fundamentally similar . A unifying model for vesicle invagination and scission How can scission proceed in the absence of dynamin ? Recent studies of clathrin - independent uptake of Shiga toxin provide evidence that actin promotes changes in the organization of the underlying lipids in endocytic tubules , and the resulting tension at membrane domain boundaries drives scission [ 43 (cid:2) ] . Drubin and colleagues have developed a quantitative theoretical model of endocytosis that suggests the membrane domains that drive scission in yeast result from differences in the distribution of PIP 2 , rather than cholesterol [ 44 , 45 , 46 (cid:2) ] . In this model , initial membrane curvature generated by coat protein assembly and actin / myosin pulling forces promotes recruitment of BAR - domain proteins , which form a tubule . The resulting increase in curvature activates the synaptojanin - like PIP 2 phosphatase Inp52 , but because BAR - domain proteins protect the tubular neck , PIP 2 hydrolysis is limited to the bud . The resulting lipid phase boundary between bud and neck creates a lateral force that constricts the neck , leading to scission . The basic tenets of this model can be extended to mammalian cells , where dynamin could have a greater role in deforming the membrane and in preventing accumulation of synaptojanin at the neck of the budding vesicle by competing for binding partners [ 46 (cid:2) , 47 , 48 ] . This would protect PIP 2 at the neck , causing phase segregation and scission . Several key features of this model remain to be tested experimentally . It will be important to deﬁne which lipid species are important for generating membrane domains and line tension , and to determine how PIP 2 phosphatases are recruited and their activity regulated . Other factors may be at work in mammalian cells ; after all , scission does not occur in dynamin knockouts despite abundant actin polymeriz - ation and BAR - domain recruitment [ 42 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It is important to note these models do not exclude roles for actin and dynamin at other steps in vesicle formation that precede the ﬁnal scission event [ 49 , 50 ] . 516 Membranes and organelles Figure 1 Endocytic invaginations in yeast and mammals . In mammalian cells , dynamin encircles the short , narrow neck of budding clathrin - coated vesicles , which have lower levels of polymerized actin ( left ) . Dynamin double knockout cells accumulate long , 36 nm diameter tubules decorated with BAR - domain proteins , actin regulatory factors , and F - actin , and capped with a clathrin - coated bud ( center ) . These are reminiscent of the tubular endocytic invaginations in yeast , which are attached to the membrane by a wide ( 30 – 50 nM ) neck , and contain BAR - domain proteins , actin regulatory proteins , and are surrounded by a matrix of polymerized actin ( right ) . Formation of elongated tubules is actin - dependent in both yeast and mammals . Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010 , 22 : 513 – 518 www . sciencedirect . com Conclusions Yeast is an important model for understanding protein trafﬁcking in higher cells , and the underlying mechan - isms that govern budding of vesicles from cellular mem - branes are generally well conserved . Recent work provides explanations for some of the apparent discre - pancies between endocytic processes in yeast and man . Others are less easily reconciled , and may reﬂect the plasticity of uptake mechanisms in various organisms and cell types . A single mammalian cell can employ a large spectrum of endocytic mechanisms to internalize different cargo , and each has different requirements for clathrin , dynamin , actin regulators , and lipids . Elucidat - ing the unique and conserved features of these processes will be essential in understanding the fundamental prin - ciples that underlie cargo selection , membrane defor - mation , and vesicle scission in all organisms and cell types .

Dev Cell 2009 , 17 : 811 - 822 . Analysis of cells derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knock - out mice shows that actin , actin regulators , and F - BAR proteins accu - mulate on arrested endocytic structures . This emphasizes the evolutionary similarity of endocytosis in yeast and mammals . 43 .
