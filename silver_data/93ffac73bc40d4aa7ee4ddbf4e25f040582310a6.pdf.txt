Identiﬁcation of several pro - teins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells . Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate speciﬁc steps in the endocytic process . Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide power - ful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites .

Endocytosis is important for all these plasma membrane – associated functions because of its role in control of the protein and lipid composition of the plasma membrane , regulation of signaling pathways , control of cell surface area , and uptake of nutrients and pathogens . In mammalian cells , wherein endocytosis is most thoroughly characterized , several distinct en - docytic pathways for internalization exist . These pathways include the clathrin - dependent pathway , the caveolar pathway , a clathrin - and caveolae - independent pathway , macropinocytosis , and phagocytosis . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is the major pathway for internalization of proteins and lipids from the plasma mem - brane , and it is important for the recycling of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals ( Brodin et al . 2000 , Brodsky et al . 2001 , Jarousse & Kelly 2001 ) . Internalization via caveolae is much less well understood but appears to have a role in cholesterol homeostasis , recycling of glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins , glycosphingolipid transport , transcytosis of serum components , and uptake of cer - tain viruses ( Razani & Lisanti 2001 ) . Macropinocytosis involves the engulfment of extracellular ﬂuid , whereas phagocytosis involves engulfment of particles such as invading bacteria ( Dramsi & Cossart 1998 , Gal´an 2001 ) . Although each of these pathways uses distinct machinery for internalization , all require remodeling of the cell cortex during the internalization step . For the clathrin - and caveolae - dependent pathways , invaginations of the plasma membrane are formed , whereas for macropinocytosis and phagocytosis , membrane protru - sions are formed . Subsequent steps involve vesicle ﬁssion , transport of vesicles away from the plasma membrane , vesicle uncoating , fusion to other membrane compartments , and sorting of cargo for degradation or recycling . The actin cy - toskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex , and there is growing evidence that F - actin directly participates in internalization events ( Munn 2001 , Qualmann & Kessels 2002 , Schafer 2002 ) . Genetic studies in yeast show a tight coupling between actin assembly and endocytosis , and the biochemical mechanisms upon which these phenotypes are based are now being revealed ( D’Hondt et al . 2000 , Munn 2001 , Shaw et al . 2001 ) . In mammalian cells , it is clear that actin is involved in the formation of membrane protrusions for macropinocytosis and phagocytosis ( May & Machesky 2001 , Welch & Mullins 2002 ) . Furthermore , recent studies of caveolae - mediated endocytosis suggest that actin dynamics play an essential role A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Although actin may not play an obligatory role in clathrin - mediated internalization in all cells , there is increas - ing evidence that actin is involved . A number of proteins that can regulate actin dynamics [ e . g . , Arp2 / 3 activators , motor proteins , F - actin crosslinking proteins , and a Cdc42 guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) ] have been identiﬁed as bridges between actin and endocytic components ( McPherson 2002 , Qualmann & Kessels 2002 , Schafer 2002 ) . Furthermore , there is now evidence that actin polymerization occurs at coated pits ( Merriﬁeld et al . 2002 ) . This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the roles of the actin cytoskeleton during endocytic internalization at the plasma membrane . INSIGHTS FROM YEAST Genetic Identiﬁcation of Proteins Important for the Internalization Step of Endocytosis Reveals a Strict Requirement for Actin More than 10 years ago , Riezman and colleagues began isolating end mutants defective in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) ( D’Hondt et al . 2000 , Munn 2001 ) . The Riezman laboratory speciﬁcally looked for mutants defective in ﬁ - factor ( pheromone ) internalization . ﬁ - factor is a small peptide secreted by yeast of the ﬁ mating type , and it is internalized after binding to the Ste2 receptor ( a G protein – coupled serpentine receptor ) on cells of the a mating type . The ﬁ - factor and Ste2 are then transported to the vacuole ( yeast lysosome ) where they are degraded ( Dulic et al . 1991 ) . Internalization and degradation of Ste2p occurs in the absence of ﬁ - factor ( constitutive endocytosis ) , but the rate increases ﬁve - to tenfold upon ﬁ - factor binding ( ligand - induced endocytosis ) ( Jenness & Spatrick 1986 ) . Themeasuringof ﬁ - factoruptakeisthemostcommonlyusedassayforinter - nalization , although more recently , internalization of the a - factor receptor , trans - porters , and permeases have been investigated ( Munn 2001 ) . Emr and colleagues isolated dim mutants defective in internalization of the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 as a second type of screen for endocytic mutants ( Wendland et al . 1996 ) . In addition , several mutants have been identiﬁed to be defective in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis as measured by uptake of the membrane - impermeant ﬂuorescent dye lucifer yellow ( LY ) ( Riezman 1985 ) . It should be noted that LY uptake assays do not distinguish between internalization defects and defects in subsequent trafﬁcking steps ( Dulic et al . 1991 , Riezman 1985 ) . Unexpectedly , some of the ﬁrst mutants identiﬁed to be defective in ﬁ - factor up - take were in ACT1 ( END7 ) , the only yeast actin gene ; SAC6 , encoding the F - actin cross - linking protein ﬁmbrin ; and SLA2 ( END4 ) , encoding an actin - binding pro - tein important for polarization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Kubler & Riezman 1993 , Munn et al . 1995 , Raths et al . 1993 ) . At approximately the same time , deletion mu - tants and temperature - sensitive mutants of CHC1 , encoding clathrin heavy chain , were also found to be defective in ﬁ - factor uptake ( Payne et al . 1988 , Tan et al . 1993 ) . Since then , a number of laboratories have contributed to the isolation of A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

The majority of these genes encode proteins that either have homologues in mammalian cells or have domains that share homology with domains present in mammalian proteins ( Table 1 ) . As we discuss below , many of these related proteins are involved in endocytosis and / or in actin functions in mammalian cells . The severity of the endocytic defects for different mutants varies from mild ( » 30 % reduction ) to showing an essentially complete block in ﬁ - factor uptake . As shown in Table 1 , the majority of mutants isolated , including mutants of CHC1 and CLC1 , show defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . The severity of the endocytic defect is generally correlated with the severity of the actin pheno - type . Exceptions to this rule are certain mutants of proteins involved in ergosterol ( sterol ) biosynthesis ( e . g . , Erg2p , Erg3p , Erg6p ) that do not have apparent actin defects ( Heese - Peck et al . 2002 , Munn et al . 1999 ) . Speciﬁc sterols are necessary for ﬁ - factor - dependent receptor hyperphosphorylation , a prerequisite for internal - ization ( Heese - Peck et al . 2002 ) . In addition , it is clear that only a subset of proteins important for normal actin organization are important for endocytic internalization . This is an important ﬁnding because it shows that defects in the actin cytoskele - ton are not a secondary effect of blocking endocytic internalization or vice versa . Rather , these results point to a speciﬁc role for actin during internalization . Proteins important for endocytic internalization ( Table 1 ) can be placed broadly into ﬁve groups based on their activities and properties : ( a ) activities affecting actin organization / dynamics , ( b ) activities regulating membrane lipid compo - sition ( sterols , phospholipids , and sphingolipids ) , ( c ) activities affecting post - translational modiﬁcations of receptors and / or other proteins important for in - ternalization ( e . g . , phosphorylation and ubiquitination ) , ( d ) activities regulating clathrin assembly ( including clathrin ) , and ( e ) lipid and / or receptor binding in - volving adaptor proteins that link endocytic components to the plasma membrane . Approximately one third of the endocytic proteins directly regulate actin assembly and / or bind to actin ( Group a ) . Considered together with the observation that most endocytic mutants also have actin defects , these observations strongly suggest that actin is required for endocytic internalization in yeast . This requirement is likely to reﬂect a direct involvement of actin because temperature - sensitive mutants af - fecting actin are blocked rapidly for endocytic internalization upon a shift to the restrictive temperature ( Kubler & Riezman 1993 ) . A role for actin in endocytosis is also supported by the fact that yeast cells treated with latrunculin - A ( Lat - A ) have endocytic defects ( Ayscough et al . 1997 ) . Lat - A sequesters G - actin , which then leads to rapid disassembly of F - actin ( Ayscough et al . 1997 ) . Actin Organization in Yeast : Are Cortical Actin Patches Sites of Endocytosis ? Yeast cells contain three types of actin ﬁlamentous structures : actin cables , an actin - myosin contractile ring , and cortical actin patches ( Pruyne & Bretscher 2000a , b ) . Actin cables are bundles of actin ﬁlaments aligned with the mother - bud axis of A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

TheyareinvolvedinpolarizedsecretionandorganelleandmRNAtrans - port . The actin - myosin contractile ring forms transiently at the mother - daughter neckandisimportantforcytokinesis . Corticalactinpatchesaretheleastunderstood of these structures . They appear by ﬂuorescence microscopy as cortical puncta , and they localize near regions of exocytosis in growing cells ( Adams & Pringle 1984 ) . Actin patches are highly dynamic structures that are constantly turning over . They persist for approximately 10 s , and they assume either highly mobile states , moving rapidly along the cell cortex ( velocities up to 1 . 9 „ m / s ) , or stationary states ( Ayscough et al . 1997 , Doyle & Botstein 1996 , Smith et al . 2001 , Waddle et al . 1996 ) . Ultrastructure analysis of actin patches suggested that these patches might associate with membrane invaginations ( ﬁnger - like membrane structures ) ( Mulholland et al . 1994 ) , but how actin is organized around these structures is not known . A host of actin - binding proteins and regulatory proteins are components of actin patches ( Goode & Rodal 2001 , Pruyne & Bretscher 2000a ) . It is interesting that many proteins important for endocytic internalization either are tightly asso - ciated with cortical actin patches or colocalize partially with cortical actin patches ( Table1 ) . Furthermore , asmentionedabove , themajorityofendocyticmutantshave defects in organization of the actin cytoskeleton , wherein cortical actin patches are depolarized and often appear larger than in wild - type cells ( Table 1 ) . Components of other actin structures ( e . g . , actin cables and the actin - myosin contractile ring ) do not appear to be involved in endocytosis , although not all components have been tested for endocytic function ( Pruyne & Bretscher 2000a ) . Taken together , these observations strongly suggest that actin patches are involved speciﬁcally in endo - cytosis . This leads to the question of whether actin patches are sites of endocytosis . As mentioned above , actin patches localize near sites of exocytosis , suggesting that they perform compensatory endocytosis , thereby recycling plasma membrane and protein machinery delivered to the plasma membrane during exocytosis . Inhibi - tion of endocytosis could prevent downregulation of cell wall synthesis machinery and prevent recycling of plasma membrane . Consistent with this possibility , many mutants of actin patch components ( e . g . , act1 - 1 , myo3 1 myo5 1 , sla1 1 , pan1 - 4 , end3 1 , sla2 1 ) have defects in cell wall assembly ( thickened and / or layered cell wall ) , and they grow larger than wild - type cells ( Ayscough et al . 1999 , Goodson et al . 1996 , Mulholland et al . 1997 , Tang et al . 2000 ) . It is not clear , however , whether a block in endocytosis causes any of these defects . For example , depolar - ized secretion and / or upregulation of machinery for cell wall synthesis may also cause the thickened cell wall phenotype ( Li et al . 2002 ) . Whether endocytosis occurs at cortical actin patches is unclear . Compared with mammalian cells , much less is known about the ultrastructure of endocytic in - ternalization sites in yeast . Coat proteins such as clathrin have not been detected at the budding - yeast plasma membrane ( Baggett & Wendland 2001 ) . Mulholland etal . ( 1999 ) showedbyelectronmicroscopythatSte2preceptorswereconcentrated at furrow - like membrane invaginations distinct from the cortical actin patches that they identiﬁed by virtue of their labeling with coﬁlin and actin antibodies . These furrow - like invaginations contained some actin but less than is present in cortical A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

This ﬁnding raises the possibility that different types of cortical actin patches exist , consistent with the observation that many proteins ( e . g . , Sla2p , Sla1p , Pan1p ) localize to cortical puncta that do not appear to contain actin - binding protein 1 ( Abp1 ) or actin ( Tang & Cai 1996 , Warren et al . 2002 , Yang et al . 1999 ) . These cortical puncta may contain actin that cannot easily be detected by light microscopy . Therefore , only a subset of cortical actin patches may represent sites of internalization . An alternative hypothesis is that cortical actin patches form transient interac - tions with endocytic sites . When cortical actin patches move rapidly along the cell cortex ( Doyle & Botstein 1996 , Waddle et al . 1996 ) , they may form short - lived connections to endocytic components . In support of the hypothesis that interactions between different patch components can be transient , Warren et al . ( 2002 ) showed by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of Sla1p - YFP and Abp1p - CFP that these proteins can associate with each other at the cell cortex but that there are also puncta that contain only Sla1p or Abp1p . In addition , the motility and relative proportion of puncta that move were different for Sla1p versus Abp1p . These experiments clearly demonstrate that there are distinct subpopulations of cortical patches , and they suggest that individual patch components may come together in a transient fashion . For future studies in yeast , it is critically important to deﬁne cortical patch motilityandproteincompositioninrelationtointernalizationevents . Keyquestions include whether patch motility is required for internalization , whether a subset of cortical actin patches localize to endocytic sites , and whether distinct patches with distinct protein compositions have distinct endocytic functions or cargo . Protein - Protein Interactions Between Components Important for Internalization : How is the Actin Machinery Recruited to Endocytic Sites ? Genetic screens led to the identiﬁcation of a number of yeast proteins impor - tant for endocytic internalization from the plasma membrane . The challenge now is to elucidate the speciﬁc role of each of these proteins and to understand at the molecular level how the actin cytoskeleton participates in the internalization event . Biochemical studies are beginning to reveal activities for these proteins and to provide information on how they interact in the cell . Figure 1 illustrates some of the interactions that have been identiﬁed between proteins important for in - ternalization and certain biochemical activities . For an excellent review detailing some of these interactions , see Goode & Rodal ( 2001 ) . The interactions shown are not necessarily direct because many were detected by coimmunoprecipitation and two - hybrid experiments . However , the cartoon provides a working model for how these proteins may assemble into modular complexes and how these complexes might induce actin polymerization at endocytic sites . A critical issue is how the endocytic machinery associates with receptors , transporters , and membranes destined to be endocytosed . As shown in Figure 1 , A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

RME can further be divided into ubiquitin - dependent inter - nalization ( see Figure 1 a ) ( Hicke 2001 ) and NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - dependent internalization ( see Figure 1 b ) ( Howard et al . 2002 , Tan et al . 1996 ) ; this division depends on the signal for internalization . Unexpectedly , most mutants defective in ﬁ - factor RME are also defective in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis , suggesting that these pathways share some of their protein machinery ( Table 1 ) . A functional actin cytoskeleton may be critically important for both pathways . One prediction is that proteins speciﬁcally involved in receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination would not be important for ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . This is the case for the redundant casein kinases , Yck1p and Yck2p , which are candidates to phosphorylate Ste2 ( Table 1 ) ( Feng & Davis 2000 , Hicke et al . 1998 ) . On the other hand , mutants of RSP5 , which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in mono - ubiquitination of receptors , have defects in both pathways ( Dunn & Hicke 2001 ) , suggesting that Rsp5p needs to ubiquitinate machinery required for ﬂuid - phase endocytosis in addition to the proteins targeted for endocytosis . Actin cytoskeleton components are candidate targets because rsp5 mutants are Lat - A resistant and show genetic interactions with genes important for actin organization ( e . g . , ARP2 , END3 , SLA2 ) ( Kaminska et al . 2002 ) . The main pathway for RME in yeast is the ubiquitin - dependent pathway ( see Figure 1 a ) . G protein – coupled receptors , permeases , and transporters are ubiqui - tinated at the cell surface to signal internalization ( Munn 2001 ) . The G - coupled receptor Ste2p has been studied most extensively , and ligand binding stimulates phosphorylation followed by ubiquitination of speciﬁc residues in the cytoplasmic tail ( Hicke & Riezman 1996 , Hicke et al . 1998 , Reneke et al . 1988 ) . The sequence motif SINNDAKSS in Ste2p , wherein the lysine is mono - ubiquitinated and the serines are phosphorylated , is sufﬁcient , although not necessary , for internaliza - tion ( Rohrer et al . 1993 ) . Outside of this motif , multiple additional lysines that get ubiquitinated are important for internalization ( Terrell et al . 1998 ) . Although we have limited knowledge regarding the sequential steps for inter - nalization in yeast , we attempt to order these events based on mutant phenotypes , genetic epistasis , and some speculation ( Figure 2 ) . In step 1 , ligand binds to the re - ceptor and triggers phosphorylation of several serine and threonine residues in the Ste2p cytosplasmic tail ( step 2 ) . Receptor hyperphosphorylation is a prerequisite for ubiquitination . The redundant casein kinase I homologues Yck1p and Yck2p are candidates for this step . In yck - ts cells , the Ste2p receptor is not internalized ow - ing to lack of phosphorylation and ubiquitination ( Feng & Davis 2000 , Hicke et al . 1998 ) . The requirement for speciﬁc ergosterols ( sterols ) appears to be coincident with this step or earlier in the pathway ( Heese - Peck et al . 2002 , Munn et al . 1999 ) . Similar to yck - ts mutants , erg ( sterol ) mutants are defective in hyperphosphoryla - tionandubiquitinationoftheSte2preceptor . Asmentionedabove , theseergosterols may not be important for a functional actin cytoskeleton ( Heese - Peck et al . 2002 ) . Akr1p ( ankyrin - repeat protein ) is also likely to act at this step because it is required for the recruitment of Yck2p to the plasma membrane ( Feng & Davis 2000 ) . A n nu . R e v .

Thisﬂowchartillustrates putative steps during ligand - induced internalization of the Ste2p receptor ( see text for details ) . The requirement for different proteins and lipids , when known , is indicated on the right side of the ﬁgure . In step 3 , the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p ubiquitinates receptors and possibly other proteins required for internalization ( Dunn & Hicke 2001 , Hicke & Riezman 1996 ) . In step 4 , adaptor proteins bind to the ubiquitinated receptor . These adaptor proteins might recruit the machinery required for actin polymerization ( see step 5 ) . Candidates to perform this adaptor function are Ent1p and Ent2p ( Ent1 / 2p ) , which have redundant functions in endocytosis and in actin cytoskeletal organiza - tion ( Wendland 2002 ) . Ent1 / 2p are related to epsins in mammalian cells , which are important for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Chen et al . 1998 ) . Ent1 / 2p contain ubiquitin - interacting motifs ( UIM ) that bind to mono - ubiquitin in vitro ( Shih et al . 2002 ) . As shown in Figure 1 , Ent1 / 2p interact with Pan1p , an Arp2 / 3 activator , and with Chc1p ( clathrin heavy chain ) ( Duncan et al . 2001 , Wendland & Emr 1998 , Wendland et al . 1999 ) . Therefore , one can speculate that Ent1 / 2p recruits Pan1p and clathrin to the receptors via interactions with ubiquitin ( Wendland 2002 ) . In support of the possibility that Ent1 / 2p function as adaptors , it has been shown A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Furthermore , the UIMs in Ent1p are important for binding to crude yeast membrane fractions ( Aguilar et al . 2003 ) . Ent1 / 2p also contain epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domains that interact with phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - biphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] ( Aguilar et al . 2003 ) . This interaction may further anchor the endocytic complex to the plasma membrane ( Aguilar et al . 2003 ) . Studies in mammalian cells suggest that binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane is important for targeting proteins to endocytic sites ( Gaidarov & Keen 1999 ) . In yeast , mutants of proteins that regulate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , such as inos - itol polyphosphate - 5 phosphatase ( Inp51p / Sjl1p , Inp52p / Sjl2p , and Inp53p / Sjl3p ) and phosphatidylinositol ( 4 ) - phosphate 5 - kinase ( Mss4p ) , are defective in endo - cytic internalization and in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Table 1 ) ( Desrivieres et al . 2002 , Singer - Kruger et al . 1998 ) . Other candidates that may function as adaptors are Sla2p and yAP180a and yAP180b ( yAP180a / b ) . These proteins are related to proteins involved in clathrin - mediated internalization in mammalian cells , huntingtin interacting protein 1 ( Hip1 ) / huntingtin interacting protein 1 related ( Hip1R ) and AP180 / CALM , re - spectively ( McMahon 1999 , McPherson 2002 ) . Similar to Ent1 / 2p , Sla2p and yAP180a / b can bind to Pan1p and clathrin and are predicted to interact with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via their ENTH - like domains [ renamed AP180 N - terminal homol - ogy ( ANTH ) domain ] ( Figure 1 ) ( Henry et al . 2002 , Wendland & Emr 1998 ; M . J . Cope , Y . Sun , J . Toshima & D . G . Drubin , unpublished data ) . Additionally , yAP180a / b have been reported to interact with Ede1p ( B . Wendland , personal communication ) . Sla2p and yAP180a / yAP180b may not interact with receptors becausetheydonotappeartocontainubiquitin - interactingdomains . However , they could help tether endocytic complexes to the plasma membrane . Sla2p is required for internalization of ﬁ - factor and is required for actin assembly in a permeabi - lized cell assay ( Li et al . 1995 ) , suggesting that it might function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery . Sla2p contains an actin - binding do - main ( I / LWEQ module ) ( McCann & Craig 1997 ) . However , it is currently not clear whether this domain is important for endocytosis ( Wesp et al . 1997 , Yang et al . 1999 ) . It has been shown that the localization of Sla2p to punctate structures at the cell cortex is dependent on clathrin but independent of F - actin ( Ayscough et al . 1999 , Henry et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , Sla1p is required for correct local - ization of Sla2p ( Ayscough et al . 1999 ) . Because Sla1p is a putative adaptor for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated internalization ( see below ) , we speculate that the cortical patches containing Sla2p are sites of endocytosis . The fact that clathrin is required to properly localize Sla2p to the cell cortex may also explain why clathrin mutants have actin defects ; Sla2p is required for normal actin cytoskeleton organization . In contrast to sla2 mutants , yap180a / b mutants do not have endocytic defects . It seems likely , however , that these proteins perform functions redundant with other proteins ( e . g . , Ent1 / 2 p or Sla2p ) . It is not clear whether AP - 2 - related proteins in yeast function in endocytosis because deletion mutants of the genes encoding subunits of this complex do not A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

Again , it is possible that this function is redundant with the functions of Ent1p , Ent2p , Sla2p , or other proteins that operate as adaptors . In the future , determining which proteins function as adaptors in ubiquitin - dependent internalization in yeast will be important . In step 5 , the machinery required for actin polymerization is recruited to en - docytic sites via binding to adaptor proteins . This can then lead to rapid F - actin polymerizationatthesesitestoprovideaforceduringvesicleformation . Mutantsof Sla2p ( end4 - 1 ) , Vrp1p ( vrp1 1 ) , and Rvs167p ( rvs167 1 ) accumulate hyperphos - phorylated and ubiquitinated Ste2p and / or Ste3p receptor at the plasma membrane , showing that these earlier steps are not blocked when endocytosis is blocked in mutants of actin - associated proteins ( Feng & Davis 2000 , Heese - Peck et al . 2002 ) . These proteins are required for a functional actin cytoskeleton ( Bauer et al . 1993 , Donnelly et al . 1993 , Yang et al . 1999 ) . Vrp1p binds to Las17p and Myo3 / 5p and may regulate their ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Evangelista et al . 2000 , Lechler et al . 2000 , Naqvi et al . 1998 ) . Rvs167p forms multiple interactions with other proteins important for endocytic internalization , which suggests that it may function as a scaffold protein in endocytosis . Further support for the conclusion that actin functions after receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination comes from studies on Pan1p and on End3p ( Shih et al . 2000 ) , which is a protein important for localization of Pan1p to the cortex ( Tang et al . 1997 ) . Mutants of Pan1p ( pan1 - 20 ) and End3p ( end3 - 1 ) block internalization of a Ste2p chimera , in which an in - frame fusion to the ubiquitin amino acid sequence has been added to a truncated cytoplas - mic tail ( Shih et al . 2000 ) . This Ste2p receptor bypasses the normal requirement for phosphorylation and ubiquitination for internalization . In the future , utilizing electron microscopy to visualize receptors ( e . g . , Ste2p ) in mutants blocked at different endocytic steps will be critical . For example , do endo - cytic sites ( labeled with Ste2p ) look different in yck mutants ( blocks step 2 ) com - pared with the way they look in sla2 / end4 mutants ( blocks after step 3 ) ? There is precedencefortheobservationofintermediateendocyticstructuresinyeastcellsbyelectronmicroscopy . Wendland et al . ( 1996 ) spheroplasted yeast cells and labeled them with an endocytic marker ( cationized ferritin ) that is often used in mammalian cells to label endocytic pathways . Interestingly , alleles of PAN1 ( pan1 - 3 ) and SLA2 ( end4 - 1 ) showed an increase in the number of plasma membrane invaginations labeled with cationized ferritin ( Wendland et al . 1996 ) . These may represent endo - cytic intermediates that failed to pinch off from the plasma membrane . Membrane invaginations were also observed in sjl1 1 / sjl2 1 double mutants ( synaptojanin - like proteins ) ( Srinivasan et al . 1997 ) . Because synaptojanin - like proteins in yeast control the concentration and the cellular distribution of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we spec - ulate that the recruitment of Ent1 / 2p is affected in sjl1 1 / sjl2 1 double mutants . This could in turn affect the recruitment of Pan1p and the actin polymerization machinery to endocytic sites . The other pathway for RME is NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated internalization ( Figure 1 ) . The NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif was originally discovered in the cytosplasmic tail of the furin - like protease Kex2p , although Kex2p is not thought to be internalized from the plasma membrane ( Tan et al . 1996 ) . This motif is also found in the Ste3p A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

The NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif is sufﬁcient for internalization of the Ste2p receptor lacking most of the cytoplasmic tail . This motif , however , is not necessary for internalization , which suggests that the ubiquitin internalization signal is masking the requirement for the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif ( Howard et al . 2002 ) . Sla1p was recently shown to bind to the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif , suggesting that Sla1p may serve as an adaptor ( Howard et al . 2002 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , SLA1 disruption severely inhibited NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated internalization of Ste2p , but it only marginally affected ubiquitin - mediated internalization . Sla1p is important for normal actin organization , and it interacts with several proteins required for both endocytosis and actin functions in yeast ( Figure 1 ) ( Ayscough et al . 1999 , Ayscough et al . 1997 , Holtzman et al . 1993 , Warren et al . 2002 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation and / or yeast two - hybrid experiments show that Sla1p can interact with Pan1p , End3p , Las17p , Rvs167p , and Abp1p ( Drees et al . 2001 , Li 1997 , Tang et al . 2000 , Warren et al . 2002 ) . Because both Pan1p and Las17p can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Duncan et al . 2001 , Winter et al . 1999 ) , Sla1p is an excellent candidate for directing actin polymerization to sites of endocytosis . During endocytosis , assembly and disassembly of the endocytic complex are likely to be tightly regulated . Evidence is emerging that this regulation is accom - plished through cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key compo - nentsoftheendocyticmachinery . Ark1pandPrk1p , tworedundantserine / threonine kinases , have been implicated in this process . Ark1p and Prk1p phosphorylate Sla1p , Pan1p , and Ent1 / 2p , and overexpression of Prk1p leads to disruption of the interaction between Pan1p and Sla1p ( Watson et al . 2001 , Zeng & Cai 1999 , Zeng et al . 2001 ) . Because Pan1p functions to promote F - actin assembly , possibly at endocytic sites , one might speculate that Ark1p / Prk1p negatively regulates actin polymerization at endocytic sites . In support of this possibility , lack of both Ark1p and Prk1p inhibits endocytosis and causes formation of large actin clumps contain - ing proteins that are important for both actin polymerization and internalization ( e . g . , Ent1p , Ent2p , Sla2p , Pan1p , Cof1p , and Sac6p ) ( Cope et al . 1999 , Watson et al . 2001 ) . Several Yeast Proteins Important for Endocytic Internalization Can Promote Actin Assembly Actin polymerization occurs preferentially at free ( growing ) barbed ends of ﬁla - ments . Because the rate - limiting step in actin ﬁlament formation is nucleation , the generation of free barbed ends controls where and when polymerization occurs . There are three known mechanisms for generating free barbed ends : de novo nu - cleation , severing of existing ﬁlaments , and uncapping of ﬁlaments . At least two of these activities ( de novo nucleation and severing ) may be important for endo - cytic internalization . To date , approximately one third of the proteins important for endocytic internalization can directly bind to actin or affect its assembly or organization ( Table 1 ) . The activities of these proteins include actin nucleation A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

In addition , Vrp1p , Sla2p , and Srv2p bind to actin , but their actin - related activities , if any , are not known ( Figure 1 ) ( Freeman et al . 1995 , McCann & Craig 1997 , Vaduva et al . 1997 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex contains seven highly conserved subunits ( Arp2p , Arp3p , Arc40p , Arc35p , Arc19p , Arc18p , and Arc15p ) , wherein Arp2p and Arp3p are actin - related proteins ( Goode & Rodal 2001 , Welch & Mullins 2002 ) . Conditional alleles of ARP2 ( arp2 - 1 ) and ARC35 ( end9 ) are defective in the uptake of uracil permease and ﬁ - factor , respectively , providing evidence that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for endocytic internalization ( Moreau et al . 1996 , Moreau et al . 1997 , Munn & Riezman 1994 ) . Because overexpression of Las17p ( yeast WASP ) sup - presses the actin and the endocytic defect of arp2 - 1 ( in this case LY uptake was measured ) ( Madania et al . 1999 ) , these experiments suggest that actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for internalization . The mammalian Arp2 / 3 activator N - WASP was recently implicated in endocytosis , suggesting that this Arp2 / 3 - related function is conserved in mammalian cells ( Kessels & Qualmann 2002 , Zhang et al . 1999 ) . In yeast , two additional proteins , Pan1p and Abp1p activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Duncan et al . 2001 , Goode et al . 2001 ) . In addition , type I myosins , Myo3p and Myo5p , bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex , and genetic and biochemical data suggest that they activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Evangelista et al . 2000 , Geli et al . 2000 , Lechler et al . 2000 ) . This mechanism has not yet been shown directly , although ﬁssion yeast type I myosins do activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Lee et al . 2000 ) . Pan1p is required for endocytosis and normal actin organization in yeast , and it interacts with other proteins important for internalization ( Figure 1 ) ( Tang & Cai 1996 , Tang et al . 1997 , Wendland & Emr 1998 , Wendland et al . 1996 , Zoladek et al . 1997 ) . Similar to las17 and pan1 mutants , mutants of Myo3 / 5p have severe defects in endocytic internalization and in actin organization ( Geli & Riezman 1996 ) . In contrast , abp1 1 cells show no apparent defect in ﬁ - factor uptake or actin organization ( Kubler & Riezman 1993 ) . Abp1p may share some redundant func - tions with Sla2p in endocytosis because combining deletions of certain domains of these proteins ( sla2 1 coil and abp1 1 SH3 ) causes defects in ﬁ - factor uptake ( Wesp et al . 1997 ) . In addition , there is genetic evidence that the role of Abp1p as an actin nucleation factor might be different from those of Las17p and Pan1p ( Goode & Rodal 2001 ) . As shown in Figure 1 , Pan1p , Las17p , Abp1p , and Myo3 / 5p form a network of interactions with other proteins important for internalization and could thereby get recruited to sites of internalization . The observation that several Arp2 / 3 activators are required for endocytic inter - nalization suggests that actin polymerization driven by distinct activators might be required during different steps in internalization . It was surprising to ﬁnd that a mutant of Las17p lacking the activation domain ( acidic motif ) does not have an A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Similarly , point mutations in the activation domain of Pan1 ( pan1 - 101 ) did not cause an endocytic defect , although a larger deletion including the activation domain ( pan1 1 855 - 1480 ) caused endocytic defects ( Duncan et al . 2001 ) . Combining alleles of PAN1 and LAS17 lacking the activation domains does cause more severe growth and actin phenotypes ( Duncan et al . 2001 ) . This suggests that Pan1p and Las17p each perform a unique function in endocytic internalization . However , they may also share a distinct function related to activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Myo3 / 5p also share functions with Las17p in actin polymerization and possibly in endocytosis ( Evangelista et al . 2000 , Geli et al . 2000 , Lechler et al . 2000 ) . Deletion of the acidic Arp2 / 3 activation motifs in both Las17p and Myo3p abolished actin nucleation in permeabilized myo3 myo5 1 yeast cells , whereas single mutants had no effect ( Lechler et al . 2000 ) . These particular mutants have not yet been tested for defects in endocytosis . It will be important to dissect the speciﬁc roles of these activators in mediating endocytic internalization . In addition to a requirement for de novo nucleation of actin ﬁlaments and / or generation of branched actin networks , there is also evidence that actin ﬁlament turnover is required for endocytic internalization . Jasplakinolide ( Jas ) , a drug that stabilizes F - actin , inhibits endocytosis in yeast ( Ayscough 2000 ) . Furthermore , Cof1p ( coﬁlin ) , which severs and depolymerizes F - actin , is critically important for LY and ﬁ - factor internalization ( Idrissi et al . 2002 , Lappalainen & Drubin 1997 ) . In a ﬁnding consistent with these results , Belmont & Drubin ( 1998 ) showed that an actin mutant ( V159N ) defective in actin ﬁlament disassembly was also defective in LY uptake . Because these conditions ( drugs and mutants ) limit the available pool of G - actin , it is currently not clear whether the requirement for actin turnover in endocytosis is due to block of new assembly , block of disassembly , or both . ENDOCYTIC FUNCTION OF THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON IN MORE COMPLEX EUKARYOTES In mammalian cells , there are several distinct pathways for endocytic internal - ization : the clathrin - dependent pathway , the caveolar pathway , a clathrin - and caveolae - independent pathway , macropinocytosis , and phagocytosis . These path - ways are distinct , but it has become evident that they share some of the same machinery . Components of the actin cytoskeleton ( e . g . , the SCAR / WASP pro - teins ) and dynamin , a protein that functions during vesicle ﬁssion ( see below ) , have been implicated in several of these pathways ( Orth & McNiven 2003 , Welch & Mullins 2002 ) . Furthermore , there is now evidence that localized polymerization of F - actin occurs at endocytic sites in caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( Pelkman et al . 2002 ) , clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Merriﬁeld et al . 2002 ) , macropinocy - tosis ( Merriﬁeld et al . 1999 ) , and phagocytosis ( May & Machesky 2001 ) . These observations of mammalian endocytosis , considered with the mounting evidence that the actin polymerization machinery is required for yeast endocytosis , suggest A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

However , differences in sensitivity to actin poisons suggest that the importance of this func - tion may vary for different organisms and cell types . Because the link between actin polymerization and phagocytosis is well established and has been reviewed previously ( May & Machesky 2001 , Welch & Mullins 2002 ) , it is not discussed in detail here . Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis Clathrin - mediated endocytosis depends on structural components of the coat and a growing list of accessory factors ( Brodsky et al . 2001 ) . Structural components of the coat ( e . g . , clathrin and AP - 2 ) are highly enriched in clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) preparations , whereas most of the accessory factors form more transient interactions with clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and CCVs . Actin and proteins im - portant for actin polymerization ( e . g . , the Arp2 / 3 complex ) are either absent or are present at low levels in CCV preparations ( P . S . McPherson , personal communica - tion ) . This observation is consistent with ultrastructure and real - time microscopy analyses , which suggest that the actin polymerization machinery may form only transient interactions with CCVs ( Fujimoto et al . 2000 , Merriﬁeld et al . 2002 ) . The clathrin coat , however , does contain actin - binding proteins . Both Hip1R and a spliced variant of Myosin VI are enriched in CCV preparations and appear to stably associate with the clathrin coat ( see Links Between Coat Components and Actin , below ) . A role for actin in clathrin - dependent endocytosis has not been as deﬁnitively es - tablished as that for other types of endocytosis ( e . g . , macropinocytosis and phago - cytosis ) . Cytochalasin - D ( CD ) , a drug that destabilizes actin ﬁlaments , inhibited apical endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells but had no detectable effect on ba - solateral endocytosis ( Apodaca 2001 ) . In other cell types , actin - depolymerizing drugs have had varied effects on RME ( Lamaze et al . 1996 , 1997 ; Salisbury et al . 1980 ; Sandvig & van Deurs 1990 ; Wolkoff et al . 1984 ) . In an extensive study , using several different actin - perturbing drugs ( Lat - A , CD , and Jas ) , Fujimoto et al . ( 2000 ) found that the ability of these drugs to inhibit clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis depended on cell type and growth conditions . It is important to note that the assay used in this study measured sealing of vesicles and not subsequent endocytic events . Therefore , in those cases in which an effect was not observed , F - actin may have played a role subsequent to vesicle sealing , such as detachment and transport of vesicles away from the cell cortex . In fact , recent live - cell - microscopy studies in mammalian cells provided evidence that actin polymerization occurs concomitant with late stages of CCV formation ( Merriﬁeld et al . 2002 ) . Taken together , these various observations suggest that actin functions in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , although this function may not always be obligatory for CCV formation . What are the speciﬁc functions of the actin cytoskeleton in CCV formation , and at which stages in CCV formation is actin involved ? Genetic approaches are less practical in mammalian cells than in yeast for example . Therefore , few A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Instead , functional studies often depend on less - than - ideal overexpression and dominant - negative phenotypes . Studies of mammalian cells , however , have some advantages over studies of yeast cells . For example , the ultrastructure of endocytic sites ( e . g . , CCPs ) in mammalian cells is well described ( Higgins & McMahon 2002 ) . Furthermore , permeabilized cell assays for endocytic internalization ( Schmid & Smythe 1991 ) and assays to reconstitute initial stages of CCV formation ( Higgins & McMahon 2002 ) have been developed . Based on the results from these assays , microinjection studies ( e . g . , antibodies , domains of proteins , or peptides ) , and overexpression studies ( e . g . , use of dominant - negative forms of the protein ) , clathrin - mediated internalization in mammalian cells has been divided into several distinct stages . These stages include coat assembly on membranes , invagination , ﬁssion , movement of vesicles away from the plasma membrane , and ﬁnally , uncoating ( Brodsky et al . 2001 , Jarousse & Kelly 2001 ) . Genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans , and studies using the lamprey reticulospinal synapse , have also contributed to our understanding of CCV formation . Clathrin is a triskelion - shaped cytoplasmic protein having three heavy chains and three light chains . According to current models , adaptor proteins ( e . g . , AP - 2 ) recruit and promote the assembly of clathrin triskelia on the plasma membrane to form clathrin lattices ( Brodsky et al . 2001 ) . The recruitment of AP - 2 to the plasma membrane is thought to involve interactions with phospholipids , tyrosine - and dileucine - based endocytic sorting motifs present in the cytoplasmic tails of re - ceptors , synaptotagmin , and accessory factors ( e . g . , Eps15 ) ( Brodsky et al . 2001 ) . Other proteins ( e . g . , ﬂ - arrestin ) can also recruit receptors to clathrin lattices , al - though these proteins do not appear to promote clathrin assembly ( Goodman et al . 1997 ) . AP180 / CALM , epsins , andpossiblyHip1 / Hip1Rmayalsofunctionasadap - tors because , similar to AP - 2 , they bind to clathrin and phospholipids , and they promote clathrin assembly in vitro ( Ford et al . 2002 , Ford et al . 2001 , Wendland 2002 ) . The recruitment of adaptors to the plasma membrane may also involve Eps15 , a protein involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Benmerah et al . 1998 , Carbone etal . 1997 ) . BecauseEps15bindstootherendocyticproteinsincludingAP - 2 , epsin , intersectin , and synaptojanin ( Benmerah et al . 1995 , Chen et al . 1998 , Haffner et al . 1997 , Sengar et al . 1999 ) , it might be part of a core endocytic complex that is re - quired for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . As discussed above , a related complex in yeast is required for endocytic internalization and normal actin organization ( Figure 1 ) . The yeast Arp2 / 3 activator Pan1p is related to Eps15 ; the putative adaptor proteins Ent1 / 2p are related to epsins ; the inositol polyphosphatase - 5 phosphatases ( Inp51p / Sjl1p , Inp52p / Sjl2p , and Inp53p / Sjl3p ) are related to synap - tojanins ; and the Sla1p / End3p complex shares conserved domains with intersectin . Eps15 has not been reported to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , intersectin - l , which binds to Eps15 , recently was shown to regulate actin assembly via Cdc42 and N - WASP ( see below ) ( Hussain et al . 2001 ) . A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

Endophilin , which is a lysophosphatic acid transferase , has been implicated in this step as well as in ﬁssion and vesicle recycling ( Gad et al . 2000 , Ringstad et al . 1999 , Schmidt et al . 1999 ) . After deeply invaginated coated pits are formed , the neck narrows to form constricted pits . These subsequently pinch off from the plasma membrane as CCVs . The large GTPase dynamin has been convincingly implicated in these steps ( Hinshaw 2000 ) . The temperature - sensitive mutant shibire in D . melanogaster , which has a mutation in the dynamin gene , is blocked in clathrin - mediated endocytosis when switched to the restrictive temper - ature ( Koenig & Ikeda 1989 , Kosaka & Ikeda 1983 ) . Visualization of the nerve terminals in this mutant shows that they accumulate constricted CCPs ( Koenig & Ikeda 1989 , Kosaka & Ikeda 1983 ) . Subsequent studies have demonstrated that dominant - negative forms of dynamin will interfere with clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis in many different cell types ( Hinshaw 2000 ) . It is not clear whether dynamin acts as a force - generating mechanochemical motor protein , or as a regulator of the ﬁssion event , possibly by recruiting other force - generating proteins , or both ( Sever et al . 2000 ) . Dynamin is a multidomain protein , with a GTPase domain , a phospholipid - binding pleckstrin - homology domain , a GTPase effector domain , and a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . Through its PRD , dynamin interacts with a number of different src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) - containing proteins ( e . g . , endophilin , syndapin , Abp1 , cortactin , intersectin , and amphiphysin ) . As discussed in the next section , many of these SH3 - containing proteins associate with the actin cytoskele - ton either directly or indirectly . After CCVs pinch off , they move away from the plasma membrane , shed their coats , and fuse with other vesicles to form early endosomes . Biochemical studies and imaging of clathrin - DsRed in live cells suggest that uncoating occurs soon after CCVs pinch off from the plasma membrane ( Gaidarov et al . 1999 , Merriﬁeld et al . 2002 ) . Auxilin and cyclin G – associated kinase have uncoating activities and are thought to recruit Hsc70 to CCVs to disassemble the clathrin coat ( Lemmon 2001 ) . Synaptojanin , a protein that hydrolyzes several phosphoinositide species , including PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is also thought to function during vesicle uncoating ( Cremona & De Camilli 2001 ) . Actin may function at several distinct stages of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . First , evidence is emerging that actin is involved in specifying sites of coated - pit formation on the plasma membrane ( Figure 3 ) . Bennett et al . ( 2001 ) recently showed that AP - 2 is organized in linear arrays that colocalize with actin stress ﬁbers . This colinearity was disrupted by treatment of cells with CD , which disas - sembles actin ( Bennett et al . 2001 ) . The linear AP - 2 staining patterns were also disrupted in cells that were induced to express the Hub fragment of clathrin , which acts as a dominant - negative inhibitor of clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Bennett et al . 2001 ) . Hip1R , a protein that binds to clathrin and F - actin , also dissociated from coated pits when Hub fragment was overexpressed ( Bennett et al . 2001 ) , sug - gesting that Hip1R may be important for proper association between clathrin and actin .

Gaidarov et al . ( 1999 ) found that treatment with the actin monomer - sequestering drug Lat - B increased the lateral movement of CCPs in the plane of the plasma membrane . Actin may therefore localize the endocytic machinery to certain domains of the plasma membrane and function in CCV formation . Localization of the endocytic machinery to certain sites on the plasma membrane may be important to organize the cell cortex and / or to establish and maintain cell polarity . This function may be especially important in polarized cells such as neurons , epithelial , and migrating cells where lipids and cargo need to be internalized at particular sites on the plasma membrane . The concept that coated pits are formed at particular sites on the plasma membrane is supported by the observations that clathrin - GFP ( green ﬂuorescent protein ) puncta in live Cos - 7 cells disappear and then reappear many times at the same site ( Gaidarov et al . 1999 ) . Furthermore , there is evidence in D . melanogaster that coated - pit formation is initiated at speciﬁc , restricted sites ( endocytic zones ) during synaptic vesicle recycling at the neuromuscular junction ( Roos & Kelly 1999 ) . Several observations also indicate that actin ﬁlaments are enriched in endocytic zones at the synapse ( Dunaevsky & Connor 2000 , Gad et al . 2000 , Shupliakov et al . 2002 ) , where actin may play a role in recycling of synaptic vesicles ( see below ) . Second , several lines of evidence suggest that the actin cytoskeleton functions during late events in coated - pit formation ( at coated - pit neck constriction , ﬁssion , and / or detachment of CCVs ) ( Figure 3 : 1b – c ) . Lamaze et al . ( 1997 ) showed that treatment of A431 cells with Lat - A blocked RME at the stage of invaginated coated pits before vesicle closing ( Lamaze et al . 1997 ) . Consistent with a role for actin at this stage , actin polymerization occurs at endocytic sites during late stages of CCV formation . In an elegant study , Merriﬁeld et al . ( 2002 ) used evanescent ﬁeld microscopy to observe the dynamics of CCV formation in live cells . By comparing ﬂuorescence intensities of clathrin - DsRed using both epiﬂuorescence and evanes - cent ﬁeld illumination , they detected the movement of clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) away from the plasma membrane . After being stationary in the plane of the plasma membrane for tens of seconds , CCSs moved approximately 100 nm deeper into the cytoplasm , away from the plasma membrane , in a process that lasted 30 – 60 s . It is currently not clear whether at the end of this process the CCVs were still connected to the plasma membrane via an extended neck or whether the endpoint represented release of CCVs ( Figure 3 : 1c versus 1c 0 ) . An alternative interpretation is that the inward movement of clathrin represents invagination of the clathrin coat ( Santini & Keen 2002 ) . Subsequently , the clathrin structures disappeared , perhaps reﬂecting CCV uncoating . It is interesting to note that the movement away from the plasma membrane occurred immediately after a brief burst of dynamin re - cruitment and was accompanied by a transient increase in actin association with the CCSs . This work represents the ﬁrst direct demonstration that actin assembly occurs at CCPs associated with the plasma membrane , and it raises the possi - bility that actin polymerization provides forces driving endocytic internalization A n nu .

These forces may sometimes function redundantly with dynamin or other accessory proteins during vesicle constriction and / or during vesicle ﬁssion because actin does not appear to play an obligatory role in the formation of CCVs in all cell types under all conditions . In addition , these experiments suggest that actin may function to propel CCVs away from the cell cortex ( Figure 3 : 1c 0 ) . An - other , nonmutually exclusive possibility is that the actin structures formed at CCSs provide tracks upon which myosin VI motor protein can transport vesicles and / or can provide a force during vesicle formation . However , the transient nature of these actin structures makes such a role seem unlikely . As we discuss below , myosin VI may be involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells that contain specialized actin structures such as microvilli . The observation that dynamin recruitment precedes the transient appearance of an actin - plume proximal to CCSs supports the model that dynamin recruits machinery required for actin polymerization to endocytic sites . Using this type of visualization analysis , it should now be possible to test this hypothesis using , for example , dominant - negative dynamin and RNA interference . In the future , it will also be important to establish the ultrastructure of the actin plumes to determine which proteins are required for their formation and whether actin plumes are required for endocytosis . Further support for a role of actin in CCV ﬁssion and transport of vesicles away from the plasma membrane comes from studies in polarized cells . CD treat - ment of MDCK and Caco - 2 cells inhibited RME ( transferrin uptake ) and led to accumulation of invaginated CCPs at the apical surface of the plasma membrane ( » twofold increase in the number of CCPs ) ( Apodaca et al . 2001 ) . The CCPs were often connected to the apical surface by long narrow necks ( Gottlieb et al . 1993 ) . Furthermore , in a recent study by Shupliakov et al . ( 2002 ) using the lamprey giant reticulospinal synapse , recycling of synaptic vesicles was shown to be associated with expansion of a cytoskeletal matrix containing actin - like ﬁlaments at the sites of endocytosis . Compounds interfering with actin functions caused accumulation of aggregates of synaptic vesicles near the endocytic zone , which suggests that recycling of synaptic vesicles was impaired ( Shupliakov et al . 2002 ) . In summary , there is evidence that actin functions during several distinct stages of CCV formation ( Figure 3 ) . First , actin may provide a scaffold for the assembly and anchoring of the endocytic machinery during CCV formation ( Figure 3 : 1a ) . Second , actinpolymerizationmayprovideaforceduringconstrictionand / orﬁssion of CCVs ( Figure 3 : 1b , c ) . Third , actin may propel newly released CCVs away from the plasma membrane ( Figure 3 : 1c 0 ) . Caveolae - Mediated Endocytosis It has been recognized for some time that there are clathrin - independent path - ways for endocytic internalization , although our understanding of these endocytic processes is in its infancy relative to our understanding of clathrin - dependent path - ways . One of these pathways is caveolae - mediated endocytosis , which has been A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Additionally , caveolae are involved in transcytosis and cell signaling . Caveolae typically appear as ﬂask - shaped plasma membrane invaginations ( 50 – 80 nm wide ) , although their composition , appearance , and func - tion are cell - type dependent ( Razani et al . 2001 ) . These membrane invaginations share features with lipid rafts . Caveolae and lipid rafts are both enriched in choles - terol and sphingolipids and can be puriﬁed in a Triton - X insoluble fraction ( Simons & Toomre 2000 ) . Caveolae , however , are distinct from lipid rafts in that they con - tain a protein coat composed primarily of caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 ( caveolin - 3 in muscle cells ) ( Rothberg et al . 1992 ) . The detailed mechanism of caveolae - mediated internalization is poorly under - stood . However , several experiments suggest that dynamin functions during the ﬁssion step , similar to its role in clathrin - mediated internalization . Expression of dominant - negative forms of dynamin , and / or microinjection of anti - dynamin anti - bodies , inhibited internalization of cholera toxin B and of Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) particles ( Henley et al . 1998 , Oh et al . 1998 , Pelkmans et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , dynamin is necessary and sufﬁcient for budding of caveolae in a cell - free budding assay ( Oh et al . 1998 ) . Dynamin is concentrated at the neck of caveolae ( Henley et al . 1998 , Oh et al . 1998 ) . The recruitment of dynamin to caveolae , however , ap - pears to be regulated . By visualizing internalization of SV40 particles , Pelkmans et al . ( 2002 ) showed that dynamin - YFP associates with caveolae ( caveolin - CFP ) at the cell cortex only after an SV40 particle was bound ( Figure 3 : 2b ) . Pelkmans et al . ( 2002 ) showed that the actin cytoskeleton is important for SV40 internalization via caveolae and that actin transiently associates with SV40 - containing caveolae at the stage when dynamin is recruited ( Figure 3 ) . Lat - A and Jas reduced virus internalization by » 60 % and inhibited infection by the virus to a similar extent . By visualizing caveolin 1 - CFP ( coat component ) and YFP - actin in live cells , Pelkmans et al . ( 2002 ) were able to determine the stage in internalization during which actin appears to function . Caveolae , similar to CCSs , show very little mobility in the plane of the membrane ( Pelkmans et al . 2002 , Thomsen et al . 2002 ) . Although Lat - A did not inhibit the association between SV40 particles and caveo - lae , it did cause the caveolae to move laterally in the plane of the plasma membrane , similar to what was seen with CCPs . This suggests that actin may function as a scaf - fold to restrict the lateral mobility of both caveolae and CCPs ( Figure 3 : 2a ) . Actin is also likely to function in later stages of caveolae internalization , possibly during ﬁssion and / or during transport of vesicles away from the plasma membrane ( Figure 3 : 2b , c ) . Ten to 20 minutes after adding SV40 particles to cells , dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton were observed . Stress ﬁbers depolymerize with a con - comitant recruitment of F - actin structures ( patches and tails ) to SV40 - containing caveolae at the cell cortex . The actin tails were on average 1 . 3 „ m long , wherein SV40 and caveolin 1 localized to one end of these tails . We speculate that these A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

The caveolae - associated tails are , however , larger and are less transient in nature . It will be important to determine which proteins are involved in promoting this F - actin tail assembly . The Arp2 / 3 complex , N - WASP , and cortactin are prime suspects . An - other important question concerns which proteins are involved in recruiting these cytoskeletal proteins to caveolae . SV40 particles induce tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at virus - loaded caveolae , and inhibition of tyrosine kinases inhibits internalization ( Pelkmans et al . 2002 ) . Therefore , it is possible that tyrosine phos - phorylation of caveolae - associated proteins triggers recruitment of components required for F - actin assembly . Finally , it is important to determine whether F - actin is required for internalization of other types of cargo via the caveolae pathway . Macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis is a specialized form of endocytosis wherein extracellular ﬂuid is engulfed to form large vesicles ( 0 . 5 – 5 „ m ) called pinosomes . Macropinocytosis may be either constitutive or stimulated by growth factors ( e . g . , epidermal growth factor and platelet - derived growth factor ) . Our understanding of this endocytic pathway in mammalian cells is fragmented because there are few molecular mark - ers to identify pinosomes in vivo . Therefore , large vesicles containing a ﬂuid - phase marker ( e . g . , rhodamine - labeled dextran ) are generally referred to as pinocytic vesicles . However , different types of pinocytic vesicles and pathways may ex - ist , depending on cell type , growth conditions , etc . Macropinocytosis , however , has been studied quite extensively in Dictyostelium discoideum ( Cardelli 2001 , Maniak 2002 ) . A number of different proteins required for macropinocytosis have been identiﬁed . Among these are several proteins that control actin organization ( e . g . , the WASP - related protein Scar , coronin , proﬁlin , DAip1 , and type I myosin ) ( Cardelli 2001 , Maniak 2002 ) . In addition , a number of proteins that may play reg - ulatory roles in macropinocytosis have been identiﬁed . These regulators include a member of the Ras family of GTPases ( RasS ) , a GEF for Ras ( RasGEFB ) , a mem - ber of the Rho family of GTPases ( Rac1 ) , and phosphatidylinositol kinase ( PI 3 - K ) ( Cardelli 2001 , Maniak 2002 ) . Actin is likely to function during formation and closure of plasma membrane protrusions to form macropinosomes ( Figure 3 : 3a ) . This process is morphologically similar to Fc (cid:176) receptor – mediated phago - cytosis , and it has been speculated that in both cases the extension of the plasma membrane is mechanistically related to lamellipodium extension . In support of this possibility , macropinocytosis appears to occur near membrane rufﬂes . In addition , actin and components important for F - actin polymerization in lammelipodia ( e . g . , WASP - related proteins ) are also important for phagocytosis and macropinocyto - sis in D . discoideum ( Hacker et al . 1997 , Insall et al . 2001 , Lorenzi et al . 2000 ) . Furthermore , the Arp2 / 3 complex and Scar localize to sites of macropinocytic and phagocytic internalization ( Insall et al . 2001 , Seastone et al . 2001 ) . Similar to clathrin - mediated endocytosis and caveolae - mediated endocytosis , actin tails or plumes have been observed to associate with newly forming pinocytic A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

These actin tails have been observed under physiological conditions ( Kaksonen et al . 2000 , Orth et al . 2002 ) , but they are rare and transient in nature . Therefore , the majority of studies have artiﬁcially induced the formation of pronounced actin tails ( e . g . , La 3 C and Ni 2 C treatment , hyperosmolar media , overexpression of type 1 PIP kinase , and overexpression of Arf6 mutants ) ( Heuser & Morisaki 1992 , Lee & De Camilli 2002 , Merriﬁeld et al . 1999 , Orth et al . 2002 , Rozelle et al . 2000 , Schafer et al . 2000 ) . Tail - like actin structures in tissue culture cells and in Xenopus oocytes or Xenopus egg exstracts have also been observed to associate with endosomes , lyso - somes , GLUT4 - positive vesicles , and Golgi - derived CCVs ( Frischknecht et al . 1999 , Kaksonen et al . 2000 , Kanzaki et al . 2001 , Rozelle et al . 2000 , Taunton et al . 2000 ) . These actin structures resemble actin comet tails that propel intra - cellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes through the cytoplasm of a host cell ( Taunton 2001 ) . This phenomenon of endosomal “rocketing” was ﬁrst observed in intact , La 3 C - and Ni 2 C - treated cells ( Heuser & Morisaki 1992 ) . More recently , Merriﬁeld et al . ( 1999 ) characterized the association between actin and pinocytic vesicles by observing GFP - actin in rat basophilic leukemia cells under - going macropinocytosis in a mildly hyperosmolar medium . In these cells , actin appeared to transiently polymerize on pinocytic vesicles ( labeled with rhodamine dextran ) as they moved inward from the plasma membrane at a speed of » 0 . 2 „ m / s . The actin tails were visible for a few minutes , consistent with observations in D . discoideum , showing that the Arp2 / 3 complex dissociates from the macro - pinosome surface 10 – 40 s after closure ( Insall et al . 2001 ) . Themechanismbywhichamembraneprotrusionistransformedintoapinosome is poorly understood . Merriﬁeld et al . ( 1999 ) speculated that pinosomes acquire the actin polymerization machinery necessary for propulsion from the crest of the plasma membrane rufﬂe . This possibility is consistent with the observation that proteins such as the Arp2 / 3 complex , N - WASP , and cortactin localize to tails associated with pinocytic vesicles ( Kaksonen et al . 2000 , Schafer et al . 2000 ) . Speciﬁc phospholipids concentrated at sites of internalization may recruit and activate , for example , WASP - related proteins . In support of this possibility , over - expression of phosphatidyl - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase , which increases the level of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , stimulates formation of vesicles propelled by actin comet tails in ﬁbroblasts ( Rozelle et al . 2000 ) . Several proteins have also been implicated in regulating macropinocytosis in mammalian cells . These include the Rho fam - ily of GTPases ( Cdc42 and Rac ) ( Nobes & Marsh 2000 ) , an effector molecule of Cdc42 and Rac , p21 - activated kinase ( Dharmawardhane et al . 2000 ) , and the ADP - ribosylation factor - 6 ( Arf6 ) ( Schafer et al . 2000 ) . Studies in dendritic cells have been particularly fruitful in elucidating the regulation of macropinocyto - sis . In dendritic cells , macropinocytosis is developmentally regulated . Immature cells engulf extracellular ﬂuid for the purpose of antigen presentation ( Inaba et al . 1993 , Sallusto et al . 1995 ) . In contrast , mature dendritic cells lose their ability to macropinocytose . This switch is thought to be regulated by Cdc42 because only immature dentritic cells have high levels of GTP - bound Cdc42 and because A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

We suggest that activation of WASP - related proteins by Cdc42 ( Rohatgi et al . 1999 ) is a mechanism to promote assembly of F - actin during macropinocytosis . As discussed above , dynamin functions in both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Recently , dynamin was shown to localize to pinosome - associated actin comet tails in rat hepatocytes , in NIH 3T3 cells , and in cells overexe - pressing type I PIP kinase , which suggests that dynamin may also function in macropinocytosis ( Lee & De Camilli 2002 , Orth et al . 2002 ) . It is interesting that overexpression of a dynamin 2 mutant harboring a mutation in the GTPase domain ( K44A mutant ) resulted in reduction in the number of actin comet tails observed in cells overexpressing PIP kinase ( Lee & De Camilli 2002 , Orth et al . 2002 ) . The pinosomes containing actin comet tails that did form also displayed a reduction in velocity and in their efﬁciency of movement . These results sug - gest that dynamin may be involved in regulating actin polymerization during macropinocytosis . It is currently not clear , however , whether dynamin functions during the internalization step . Microinjection of inhibitory antibodies against dy - namin or expression of dominant - negative forms of dynamin did not appear to inhibit macropinocytosis ( M . A . McNiven , personal communication ) . However , disruption of the gene encoding a dynamin homologue in D . discoideum inhibited macropinocytosis ( Wienke et al . 1999 ) . Furthermore , dynamin localizes to phago - cytic cups in macrophages , and the K44A dynamin mutant blocks phagocytosis ( Gold et al . 1999 ) . Itiscriticaltocharacterizepinocyticvesiclesinmoredetail . Importantquestions include the following : Which proteins associate with pinocytic vesicles ? What is the ultrastructure of the actin comet tails ? At which stage in macropinocytosis is dynamin required ? How does dynamin inﬂuence actin dynamics ? How are these components ( e . g . , dynamin , actin ) recruited to newly forming pinosomes ? PROTEINS AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON AND THE CLATHRIN - MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS MACHINERY Links Between Coat Components and Actin Recently , several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the clathrin coat have been identiﬁed ( Table 2 ) , raising the possibility that the endocytic machinery is physically connected to the actin cytoskeleton at the cell cortex . Two of these proteins , Hip1R and a spliced variant of myosin VI , are enriched in CCVs and can interact both with clathrin coat components and with F - actin ( Buss et al . 2001 , Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 1999 , Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 2001 ) . In addition , ankyrin , which provides a linkage between spectrin - actin networks and the plasma membrane , binds to clathrin in vitro ( Michaely et al . 1999 ) . Finally , two recent A n nu .

HIP1R AND HIP1 Hip1R is a component of CCPs and CCVs , and it binds to clathrin and F - actin ( Table 2 ) ( Figure 4 a ) . Hip1R belongs to a conserved family of proteins that includes Sla2p / End4p , a protein essential for both endocytosis and actin function in yeast ( see Insights From Yeast , above ) ( Holtzman et al . 1993 , Wesp et al . 1997 , Yang et al . 1999 ) . Hip1R is closely related to Hip1 ( » 50 % overall amino acid sequence identity ) , a protein implicated in the pathology of Huntingtons disease ( Kalchman et al . 1997 , Wanker et al . 1997 ) . Recently , Hip1 was also shown to be enriched in CCVs and to colocalize with markers for RME ( Metzler et al . 2001 , Mishra et al . 2001 , Waelter et al . 2001 ) . Hip1R is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 1999 ) , whereas Hip1 was originally reported to be predominantly expressed in the central nervous system ( Kalchman et al . 1997 ) , although it now appears to be expressed in other tissues as well ( Chopra et al . 2000 ) . Members of the Sla2 / Hip1 family have a conserved domain structure . At the N terminus , they contain an ANTH domain related to the ENTH domain found in several proteins implicated in endocytosis , including epsins and AP180 / CALM , as well as their yeast homologues ( Kay et al . 1999 , McCann & Craig 1999 ) . The ENTH / ANTH domains of CALM and epsin bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane ( Ford et al . 2001 , Itoh et al . 2001 ) . Because all the CALM residues implicated in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding are conserved in Hip1R , it is highly likely that Hip1R also associates with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . A coiled - coil region of approximately 300 amino acids containing a short leucine zipper that in yeast Sla2p has been implicated in dimerization and endocytosis ( Wesp et al . 1997 , Yang et al . 1999 ) follows the N - terminal region . Hip1R , Hip1 , and Sla2p interact with clathrin light chain via the central coiled - coil region ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 2001 , Henry et al . 2002 , Legendre - Guillemin et al . 2002 ) . Finally , at the C terminus , these proteins contain two shorter predicted coiled coils and a talin - like F - actin - binding module ( I / LWEQ ) ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 1999 ; McCann & Craig 1997 , 1999 ; Yang et al . 1999 ) . Hip1R and Sla2p bind to F - actin via the talin - like domain , whereas Hip1 was reported not to bind to F - actin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 1999 , Legendre - Guillemin et al . 2002 , McCann & Craig 1997 ) . In addition to these features common to all family members , Hip1 uniquely contains an ﬁ - adaptin binding motif ( DPF ) and a clathrin box motif ( LMDMD ) in a region preceding the coiled coil ( Metzler et al . 2001 , Mishra et al . 2001 , Waelter et al . 2001 ) . The DPF motif in Hip1 interacts with ﬁ - adaptin of the AP - 2 complex , and the LMDMD interacts with clathrin heavy chain in vitro ( Metzler et al . 2001 , Mishra et al . 2001 , Waelter et al . 2001 ) . What is the function of the Hip1 / Sla2 family of proteins ? A number of exper - iments suggest that Hip1R is tightly associated with clathrin during CCV forma - tion .

Second , the stoichiometry of Hip1R in CCVs is high ( » 10 clathrin : 1 Hip1R ) ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . 2002 ; A . E . Y . Engqvist - Goldstein , unpublished observations ) . Third , at the ultrastruc - tural level , immunogold labeling of unroofed cells showed that Hip1R localizes to CCPs ( lattices and invaginated CCPs ) ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 2001 ) . Hip1R frequently localizes to the edges of the forming coated pits , where it appears to connect to ﬁlamentous actin at the cortex . Because Hip1R can simultaneously bind to both F - actin and polymerized clathrin in vitro , Hip1R may be important in tethering CCPs at the cell cortex ( Figure 3 : 1a ) . This is a possibility consistent with the observation that overexpression of clathrin hub dissociates Hip1R from CCPs and disrupts the alignment of CCPs with F - actin ( Bennett et al . 2001 ) . Further support for a function of Hip1R at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery comes from a recent study from our lab ( A . E . Y . Engqvist - Goldstein , C . X . Zhang , S . Carreno , J . E . Heuser & D . G . Drubin , manuscript in preparation ) . To better understand the function of Hip1R and to gain insights into the function of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis , we used RNA interference to reduce the expression of Hip1R in HeLa cells . These cells are viable , but they show defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the spatial distribution of CCSs . Speciﬁcally , F - actin and the machinery involved in actin polymerization ( e . g . , the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin ) are stably associated with a subset of CCSs at the cell cortex . Many of these actin structures are tail - like . Dynamin , clathrin , and AP - 2 localize to the interface between the F - actin tails and the plasma mem - brane . Time - lapse video - microscopy of live cells and analysis of unroofed cells suggest that the actin structures are tethered to the cell cortex via association with structures containing clathrin , AP - 2 , and dynamin . This phenotype is rescued by expressing a Hip1R construct that cannot be targeted by the siRNA , demonstrating that the observed effect is due to loss of Hip1R function . Taken together with data of Merriﬁeld et al . ( 2002 ) showing that actin transiently associates with clathrin at endocytic sites , these observations suggest that Hip1R is needed to form a produc - tive association between F - actin and the endocytic machinery , but it is not required to recruit actin to endocytic sites . Alternatively , Hip1R may negatively regulate F - actin assembly at CCSs . Hip1 and Hip1R may also function to promote assembly of clathrin and / or to help remodel the clathrin coat during CCV formation . Both Hip1R and Hip1 can promote assembly of clathrin in vitro ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 2001 , Legendre - Guillemin et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of the clathrin - binding mo - tif in Hip1 inhibits transferrin uptake in Cos - 7 cells , although this inhibition is mild compared , for example , to the effects of dominant - negative dynamin mutants ( Metzler et al . 2001 ) . MYOSIN VI Another likely candidate to provide a link between actin and the clathrin coat is myosin VI ( Table 2 , Figure 4 b ) . Myosins are motor proteins that associate with actin ﬁlaments , generate forces for membrane protrusion and A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Genetic studies in mouse , D . melanogaster , and C . elegans have identiﬁed a role for myosin VI in a range of diverse biological processes such as hearing , cell mi - gration , embryo development , and spermatogenesis ( Buss et al . 2002 ) . Recently , myosin VI has also been implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Buss et al . ( 2001 ) showed that a spliced variant of myosin VI is enriched in CCVs and colo - calizes with clathrin - coat components . Myosin VI binds directly to disabled 2 ( Morris et al . 2002 ) , which may recruit myosin VI to CCPs because disabled 2 binds directly to AP - 2 and tyrosine - based sorting motifs present in the cytoplasmic tails of the low - density lipoprotein receptors ( Morris & Cooper 2001 ) . The spliced variant of myosin VI is primarily expressed in microvilli of polarized cells , and it contains a large insert in the tail domain , which is important for CCV targeting . Myosin VI without the insert also colocalized with markers for RME but not to the same extent as the isoform with the insert . Overexpression of the tail domain containing the insert inhibited transferrin uptake , consistent with a functional role for myosin VI in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Buss et al . 2001 ) . Myosin VI is the only known myosin to move toward the minus ( pointed ) end of actin ﬁlaments ( Wells et al . 1999 ) . Because actin ﬁlaments are generally oriented with their plus ( barbed ) ends toward the plasma membrane , myosin VI may provide a force during CCV formation—either deforming the membrane inward or pulling newly formed vesicles away from the plasma membrane through the cortical actin network ( Buss et al . 2001 ) . Because this spliced variant of myosin VI is primarily expressed in microvilli of polarized cells , it is an ideal candidate for transporting endocytic vesicles down microvilli along actin ﬁlaments , toward the main body of the cell . Dynamin and the Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamin is crucial for the ﬁssion step in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Hinshaw 2000 ) . Recent data also suggest that dynamin is involved in regulating actin dynam - ics ( Orth & McNiven 2003 ) . Overexpression of the dymanin K44A mutant , which binds GTP with reduced afﬁnity , not only inhibits endocytosis but also affects the distribution of actin stress ﬁbers and affects cell shape ( Damke et al . 1994 ) . It was not clear from these studies , however , whether these cytoskeletal defects were sec - ondary defects caused by inhibition of endocytosis . Recently , dynamin was more directly linked to the actin cytoskeleton . In quiescent cells , dynamin 2 predomi - nantly associates with CCVs ( McNiven et al . 2000 ) . However , upon treatment with growth factors to induce cell migration , dynamin 2 became associated with actin - rich membrane structures such as lamellipodia ( McNiven et al . 2000 ) . In addition , as discussed above , dynamin 2 has been implicated in regulation of actin dynam - ics during macropinocytosis , wherein it localizes to actin comet tails ( Lee & De Camilli 2002 , Orth et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , dynamin 2 colocalizes with actin in podosomes ( Ochoa et al . 2000 ) , adhesion structures that are composed of a narrow tubular invagination surrounded by a dense network of actin ﬁlaments . Ochoa et al . ( 2000 ) showed that overexpression of a GFP – dynamin 2 mutant corresponding A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

How is dynamin physically connected to the actin cytoskeleton ? In the past couple of years , several proteins that could act at the interface between dynamin and actin have been identiﬁed ( Table 3 ) . Syndapin , Abp1 , cortactin , and intersectin all contain SH3 domains that can bind to the proline - rich domain of dynamin ( Figure 4 ) . In addition , proﬁlin binds to dynamin ( Witke et al . 1998 ) . Each of these dynamin - binding proteins is in some way connected to the machinery involved in actin polymerization . Syndapin and intersectin - l bind to N - WASP ( Hussain et al . 2001 , Qualmann et al . 1999 ) , a potent activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas cortactin and yeast Abp1 can directly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goode et al . 2001 , Uruno et al . 2001 , Weaver et al . 2001 ) . This activation activity has not been demonstrated for mammalian Abp1 , although this protein closely colocalizes with the Arp2 / 3 complex in growth - factor - treated cells ( Kessels et al . 2000 ) . Proﬁlin binds to G - actin , promotes nucleotide exhange , and permits assembly at barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments ( Pantaloni et al . 2001 ) . One might therefore speculate that some or all of these dynamin - binding proteins might promote actin polymerization in the vicinity of dynamin during different endocytic events . This may occur , for example , during the budding of CCVs and caveolae - derived vesicles . A burst of actin polymerization at the constricted neck may facilitate detachment of vesicles from the membrane , may move vesicles away from the cortex , or both . SYNDAPIN Syndapin ( synaptic , dynamin - associated protein ) , also referred to as PACSIN , has been implicated in both clathrin - mediated endocytosis and actin cytoskeletal functions ( Table 3 , Figure 4 f ) . There are three closely related syn - dapin isoforms in mammalian cells . Syndapin I is expressed primarily in the brain ( Qualmann et al . 1999 ) , syndapin II is expressed ubiquitiously ( Qualmann & Kelly 2000 ) , and syndapin III is expressed primarily in lung and muscle ( Modregger et al . 2000 ) . Members of the syndapin protein family share a similar domain structure . Each family member contains a conserved N - terminal region , followed by two predicted coiled - coil regions , several arginine - proline - phenylalanine ( NPF ) se - quences , and a highly conserved SH3 domain at the C terminus . Syndapin interacts via its SH3 domain with several proteins involved in membrane trafﬁcking includ - ing dynamin , synaptojanin , and synapsin ( Qualmann & Kelly 2000 , Qualmann et al . 1999 ) . Additionally , syndapin interacts with N - WASP and Son - of sevenless ( Qualmannetal . 1999 , Wasiaketal . 2001 ) . Insupportofaroleforsyndapininendo - cytosis , overexpression of its SH3 domain , which presumably sequesters dynamin , inhibits RME ( Qualmann & Kelly 2000 ) . This inhibition occurs at a step after constriction of the coated pit , as demonstrated using a permeabilized cell assay for endocytic internalization ( Simpson et al . 1999 ) . In support of the possibility that syndapin has both endocytic and actin functions , overexpression of the full - length protein induces the formation of ﬁlopodia ( Qualmann & Kelly 2000 ) . This pheno - type may occur through activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by N - WASP because this phenotype was suppressed by coexpressing the region of N - WASP that interacts A n nu . R e v .

Furthermore , targeting of syndapin - N - WASP complexes to the mitochondria causes N - WASP - dependent polymerization of F - actin at these sites ( Kessels & Qualmann 2002 ) . Syndapin is therefore an excellent candidate for recruiting N - WASP to the endocytic machinery to promote assembly of F - actin during late stages of CCV formation . Further evidence for the possibility that syndapin - N - WASP drives actin assem - bly proximal to dynamin comes from a recent study showing that N - WASP is directly involved in RME and that this function is coupled to its ability to bind to syndapin ( Kessels & Qualmann 2002 ) . Overexpression of the PRD of N - WASP , or microinjection of anti - WASP antibodies , inhibited transferrin uptake ( Kessels & Qualmann 2002 ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with results of studies in lym - phocytes showing that WASP knock - out mice exhibit defects in T cell – receptor endocytosis in addition to defects in actin organization ( Zhang et al . 1999 ) . Syn - dapin binds to N - WASP via the PRD , and overexpression of syndapin rescues the endodocytic defects asssociated with overexpression of the PRD domain of N - WASP . This ﬁnding suggests that the syndapin - N - WASP interaction is important for endocytosis . It is not clear , however , whether syndapin can interact with dy - namin and N - WASP simultaneously . To fulﬁll such a role , syndapin would have to use the same SH3 domain to interact with both proteins . This may be accomplished through higher - order protein interactions and / or oligomerization ( Qualmann & Kelly 2000 ) . INTERSECTIN Intersectin is a modular scaffolding protein implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , actin cytoskeletal organization , and cell signaling ( Table 3 , Figure 4 e ) . There are two intersectin genes and several spliced variants of each ( Guipponi et al . 1998 , Sengar et al . 1999 ) . We discuss one short form ( intersectin - s ) and two long forms ( intersectin - l and intersectin 2 - l ) . Intersectin - s is ubiquitously expressed and contains two N - terminal Eps15 - homology domains , followed by a central coiled - coil domain , then by ﬁve SH3 domains ( Hussain et al . 1999 ) . The Eps15 - homology domains of intersectin bind to epsin ; the coiled - coil domain inter - acts with Eps15 ; and a subset of the SH3 domains bind to dynamin , synaptojanin , and Son - of sevenless ( Hussain et al . 1999 , Roos & Kelly 1999 , Sengar et al . 1999 , Tong et al . 2000 , Yamabhai et al . 1998 ) . Most of the intersectin - interacting pro - teins are involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , suggesting that intersectin has an endocytic function . This possibility is supported by the observation that over - expression of intersectin in Cos - 7 cells inhibits transferrin uptake ( Sengar et al . 1999 ) , although this is likely caused by the sequestering of its binding partners . In addition , expression of individual intersectin SH3 domains inhibits endocytosis at different stages , which suggests that intersectin may function both in early events leading to the formation of constricted coated pits and in late events leading to CCV ﬁssion ( Simpson et al . 1999 ) . Intersectin - l is predominately expressed in the brain , and it contains , in addition to the domains found in intersectin - s , a C - terminal extension containing a Dbl - homology , pleckstrin - homology , and C2 domain ( Hussain et al . 1999 ) .

Recently , Hussain et al . ( 2001 ) demonstrated that intersectin - l functions as a GEF for Cdc42 . Overexpression of intersectin - l in cul - ture cells caused induction of ﬁlopodia , which is a phenotype associated with Cdc42 activation . Furthermore , intersectin - l stimulated actin nucleation through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex in a permeabilized cell assay using human neutrophils . Intersectin - l also binds directly to N - WASP , and this interaction up - regulates the GEF activity . Thus intersectin - l can not only recruit machinery re - quired for actin polymerization to the plasma membrane , it also can stimulate actin assembly via Cdc42 and N - WASP . Because intersectins also interact with epsin , dynamin , and Eps15 ( three main players in endocytosis ) , intersectin is an excellent candidate for facilitating polymerization of actin at endocytic sites . Additional evidence that intersectin may function to integrate Cdc42 signal - ing with WASP - mediated actin polymerization comes from a study of T cells ( McGavin et al . 2001 ) . Intersectin 2 - l interacts with WASP and activates Cdc42 . Furthermore , while overexpression of full - length intersectin 2 - l increased ligand - induced endocytosis of the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , an intersectin construct lacking the Dbl - homology domain efﬁciently inhibited internalization of the TCR complex . This complex is internalized via the clathrin - mediated pathway , and in - ternalization is dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton ( McGavin et al . 2001 ) . Ligand - induced TCR internalization may therefore be an excellent pathway with which to dissect the speciﬁc functions of intersectin and other proteins thought to act at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery CORTACTIN AND ABP1 Cortactin was originally identiﬁed as a substrate for Src - related kinases ( Wu et al . 1991 ) , but it has recently been implicated in membrane dynamics and actin cytoskeletal functions ( Table 3 , Figure 4 d ) . Cortactin is widely expressed in tissues and is often overexpressed in transformed cell lines , including certain cancers ( Schuuring et al . 1993 , Wu & Parsons 1993 ) . In invasive breast cancer cells , cortactin localizes to invadopodia , which are invasive structures , pos - sibly related to podosomes ( Schuuring et al . 1993 ) . Invadopodia are rich in F - actin , and they degrade the extracellular matrix ( Bowden et al . 1999 ) . Cortactin also lo - calizes to both the leading edge of the cell in lamellipodia ( Wu et al . 1991 ) and the endocytic compartments . Kaksonen et al . ( 2000 ) showed that cortactin is present on endosomal vesicles , where it colocalizes with the Arp2 / 3 complex in actin comet tails . Furthermore , Cao et al . ( 2003 ) showed that cortactin is a component of CCPs . Microinjection of anticortactin antibodies inhibited transferrin uptake , which suggests that cortactin participates in RME ( Cao et al . 2003 ) . Cortactin is a multidomain protein consisting of an acidic motif , followed by 6 . 5 tandemly repeated 37 – amino acid segments , an ﬁ - helical region , a proline - rich segment , and an SH3 domain located at the C terminus ( Wu et al . 1991 ) . It wasrecentlyshownthatcortactindirectlyactivatestheArp2 / 3complexandinhibits debranching of the resulting ﬁlament networks in vitro ( Uruno et al . 2001 , Weaver et al . 2001 ) . The acidic motif of cortactin is sufﬁcient for it to bind to the Arp2 / 3 A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v . B i o l . 2003 . 19 : 287 - 332 .

Because cortactin localizes to actin - rich membrane structures such as podosomes , invadopodia , rocketing en - dosomes , and lamellipodia , one might speculate that cortactin functions to promote F - actin assembly on membranes . Alternatively , cortactin may affect actin ﬁlament turnover because it inhibits ﬁlament debranching ( Weaver et al . 2001 ) . In support of these various possibilities , Schafer et al . ( 2002 ) recently showed that cortactin caused association of F - actin bundles with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes in vitro . Dynamin , which binds directly to cortactin ( McNiven et al . 2000 ) , was im - portant for this activity , and this activity was dependent on the ability of cortactin to bind dynamin via cortactin’s SH3 domain ( Schafer et al . 2002 ) . These results suggest that dynamin may recruit cortactin to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich clusters in the plasma membrane ( e . g . , endocytic sites , podosomes ) and may regulate cortactin’s ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and / or its ability to inhibit debranching of ﬁlament networks . Abp1 shares many features with cortactin ( Table 3 , Figure 4 c ) : It is a Src substrate ( Larbolette et al . 1999 , Lock et al . 1998 ) , it binds to F - actin , it colocalizes with the Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia upon growth factor stimulation , and it binds to dynamin through an SH3 domain ( Kessels et al . 2000 , 2001 ) . Recently , Goode et al . ( 2001 ) found that yeast Abp1 binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex . The mechanism of activation appears similar to that of cortactin ; both proteins appear to increase the afﬁnity of the Arp2 / 3 complex for actin ﬁlaments ( Olazabal & Machesky 2001 ) . Although mammalian Abp1 lacks the acidic motif involved in Arp2 / 3 activation , it may form a complex with other proteins that bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Upon growth - factor treatment , Abp1 colocalizes with the Arp2 / 3 complex at lamellipodia ( Kessels et al . 2000 ) and with dynamin in puncta that also contain clathrin coat components such as AP - 2 and Hip1R , which suggests that the latter structures are sites of endocytosis ( Kessels et al . 2001 ) . In support of a role in endocytosis , overexpression of the Abp1 SH3 domain inhibits transferrin uptake ( Kessels et al . 2001 ) . The endocytosis block was rescued by coexpressing either dynamin or an Abp1 construct containing the actin - binding modules together with the SH3 domain . Thus Abp1 may support endocytosis by combining cytoskeletal functions with its ability to interact with dynamin . Further support for a role for Abp1 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis comes from a recent study showing that knock down of Abp1 expression using RNA interference inhibits transferrin uptake ( Mise - Omata et al . 2003 ) . CONCLUDING REMARKS Recent work has provided evidence that the actin cytoskeleton directly participates in endocytic internalization . Microscopy studies in mammalian cells show that F - actin is recruited to endocytic sites during internalization in caveolae - mediated endocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and macropinocytosis .

Studies in both yeast and mammalian cells have also begun to unravel some of the activities of these proteins . The stage is now set for addressing speciﬁc questions regarding the role of actin in endocytosis . At which step ( s ) during internalization does actin function ? How is the assembly of F - actin at endocytic sites regulated ? To address these questions , the relationship of endocytic sites to the actin assembly machinery must be deﬁned . Time - lapse video microscopy of actin and different proteins critical for internalization should be fruitful . Functional studies on the putative linker proteins will be needed to determine that the actin - associated activities of these proteins ( e . g . , actin binding , activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ) are important for their endocytic functions . RNA interference to reduce the expression of these proteins , in combination with total internal reﬂection microscopy to visualize the recruitment of F - actin to endocytic sites , should be informative . Finally , it will be important to develop in vitro assays for endocytic internalization that faithfully recapitulate the requirement for F - actin .

C - 2 ENGQVIST - GOLDSTEIN n DRUBIN Figure 1 Protein complexes in the yeast endocytic machinery . Proteins important for endocytic internalization in yeast appear to form complexes that can promote F - actin assembly at endocytic sites . Endocytosis in yeast can be classified into two main pathways based on cargo : ( a , b ) receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) and ( c ) fluid - phase endocy - tosis . RME can further be divided into ( a ) ubiquitin - dependent internalization and ( b ) NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - dependent internalization ; this division depends on the signal for internal - ization . Sla1p is an adaptor for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - dependent internalization , whereas Ent1 / 2p appears to be an adaptor for ubiquitin - mediated internalization . The dashed circles identi - fy three putative functional modules based on the Arp2 / 3 activators Las17p , Pan1p , and Abp1p ( Goode & Rodal 2001 ) . Physical interactions between proteins ( coimmunoprecipi - tation , yeast two - hybrid , and / or direct interactions ) are indicated with double - headed arrows . Proteins important for internalization are colored and outlined in black . Known identities or activities of these proteins are indicated in the key . 12 - HI - RESOLUTION - VERSION 9 / 15 / 2003 7 : 56 PM Page 2 A n nu . R e v . C e ll D e v .

ACTIN AND ENDOCYTOSIS C - 3 Figure 3 Putative actin functions in different endocytic pathways ( clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis ) . Actin is likely to function at different stages during endocytic internalization . First , actin may provide a scaffold for the endocytic machinery during formation of CCVs and caveolae ( see 1a and 2a ) . Second , actin may pro - vide a force driving invagination and / or fission of CCVs and caveolae ( see 1b , 1c , and 2b ) . Third , actin may provide a force to move vesicles formed by each of these pathways away from the plasma membrane ( see 1c (cid:57) , 2c , and 3c ) . Additionally , the actin cytoskeleton plays a role during the formation of membrane protrusions required for the formation of macropinocytic vesicles ( see 3a ) . 12 - HI - RESOLUTION - VERSION 9 / 15 / 2003 7 : 56 PM Page 3 A n nu .
