Age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) is one of the leading causes of low vision in developed countries , and the incidence is expected to rise in the next decade ( World Health Organization , 2014 ) . The most frequently cited complaint by individuals with vision loss is difficulty reading ( Rubin , 2013 ) . A loss of recreational activities like reading has been linked to reduced quality of life and depression in this population ( Hazel , Latham , Armstrong , Benson , & Frost , 2000 ; Rovner & Casten , 2002 ) . It is therefore imperative that research examines avenues through which those with low vision can continue to read for pleasure with minimal frustration . In a series of three studies , the present research examines reading satisfaction and low vision aid ( LVA ) use . Study 1 concerns reading satisfaction of low vision and normally sighted readers using a tablet computer . This study compared five variations of presenting text on the screen , and subjective measures of preference and satisfaction were emphasized . Study 2 takes a more applied approach to explore the use of three of the five presentations used in Study 1 over time . Study 3 is a survey that extends the findings of Studies 1 and 2 by measuring aspects of reading device awareness , training , satisfaction , and use among a larger sample of low vision readers . Results from Studies 1 and 2 suggest improved perceptions of alternative text formats over time , the potential value of tablet devices , and emphasize the role of enjoyment in reading . Study 3 suggests that tablets and e - readers may be under - represented in low vision rehabilitation . viii TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter Page 1 .

The term low vision originated in the 1950’s as a way for healthcare professionals to distinguish vision conditions between the extremes of full sight and blindness . Any chronic form of vision impairment that cannot be corrected with eyeglasses and affects everyday function characterizes low vision ( Elliott et al . , 1997 ; Legge , 2016 ) . A heuristic for determining low vision is the inability to read standard newspaper print with best optical correction at a 40 cm viewing distance . Clinically , low vision is considered to be a best conventionally corrected ( with eyeglasses or contact lenses ) visual acuity worse than 20 / 60 in the better seeing eye ( Legge , Ahn , Klitz , & Luebker , 1997 ) . The World Health Organization’s 2010 estimation reported that approximately 285 million people in the world were affected by visual impairment ( Pascolini & Mariotti , 2010 ) . A subset of this population is characterized as having low vision , which affected 246 million people worldwide , while blindness ( acuity less than 20 / 200 in the better eye or 20 degrees or less visual field ) accounted for the remaining 39 million . Conservative estimates by the National Eye Institute ( 2014 ) suggest between 3 . 5 and 5 million Americans with visual impairment , and 1 million who are legally blind . Cases of visual impairment also appear to be growing as the population ages , as most of the leading causes of visual impairment are associated with age . What is Age - related Macular Degeneration ? One of the most common causes of blindness in the developed world is age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . AMD primarily affects individuals over the age of 60 and 2 increases in likelihood with age , appearing in 12 % of people over age 80 in the United States ( Wong et al . , 2014 ) . Globally , AMD affected 23 million people in 2010 , and the incidence is expected to rise considerably in the next 40 years ( Smith , 2010 ) . The global population is expected to grow to approximately 9 . 5 billion by 2050 , with the population of people over age 60 exhibiting the most substantial demographic growth . As age is the strongest correlated factor with AMD , we will likely see a sharp increase in the incidence of AMD in the coming decades , with a potential growth from 23 million people affected by the disease in 2010 to 80 million by 2050 ( Smith , 2010 ; Velez - Montoya , 2014 ) . AMD is a disease of the macula that comes in two forms : wet and dry . The wet form accounts for only 20 % of AMD cases , but results in 90 % of cases of severe vision loss . Due to the severity of its prognosis , wet AMD has garnered the most attention in research . Wet AMD is characterized by leaking blood vessels and resulting scarring that leads to a rapid onset of vision loss ( Ferris , Fine , & Hyman , 1984 ; Jager , Mieler , & Miller , 2008 ) . The dry form typically presents in a gradual onset of vision degradation . One of the early symptoms of dry AMD is an accumulation of drusen , or yellow deposits , under the retina ( see Figure 1 ) . When drusen are soft and clustered , they can lead to the development of wet AMD and subsequently more severe vision loss ( Sunness et al . , 1997 ) . Both wet and dry forms of AMD often affect the center of the macula toward the fovea , causing a scotoma , or blind spot , in central vision . Patients with late stages of dry Figure 1 . A normal retina ( left ) and a retina with AMD ( right ) . The retina with AMD exhibits drusen near the fovea . 3 AMD will develop vision difficulties over the course of months or years , while those with wet AMD will suffer sudden severe vision loss over the course of days or weeks as a result of hemorrhaging and fluid leakage ( Sunness et al . , 1997 ; Alfaro et al . , 2006 ) . Central scotomas can result in dark spots or distortion at or near the point of fixation . As a result , many aspects of daily living are affected and patients sometimes have to learn to use their peripheral vision to perform tasks . Although the preservation of peripheral vision prevents AMD from causing total blindness , up to a third of those who experience vision loss are highly susceptible to reduced quality of life and depression , even if vision is preserved in one eye ( Casten , Rovner , & Tasman , 2004 ; Slakter & Stur , 2005 ) . To compensate for their loss of central vision , patients with conditions like AMD often develop a preferred retinal locus ( PRL ) . A PRL develops when the visual system elects one or more eccentric locations to act as a “pseudo - fovea” for the affected person to perform foveal visual tasks such as directing eye movements ( Timberlake et al . , 1986 ; Schuchard , 2005 ) . Development of a PRL is very common for individuals with central scotomas . In a study of 825 patients , 84 % of low vision eyes fixated using a recognizable PRL ( Fletcher & Schuchard , 1997 ) . PRLs often develop spontaneously , and more research is necessary to understand the circumstances and retinal locations in which one or multiple PRLs develop . To further complicate the study of these pseudo - foveae , low vision patients often fixate using a peripheral retinal location without knowing ( Fletcher , Schuchard , & Watson , 1999 ) . This reinforces the need for rehabilitation techniques to focus on identifying and training the location of the PRL so that patients can make use of its potential benefit ( Pijnacker , Verstraten , van Damme , Vandermeulen , & Steenbergen , 2011 ) . 4 Researchers have hypothesized that a PRL in the upper or lower visual field would be beneficial for reading . In this instance , fixations would move across a line of text without occluding upcoming words by the scotoma . However , findings contradict this intuition . Fletcher et al . ( 1999 ) tested 99 patients with scotomas to the left , right , above , and below the PRL . Results indicated no significant difference in reading rate between the four groups . Further research has demonstrated inconsistency with the location of the PRL and reading proficiency ( Legge , Ross , Isenberg , & Lamay , 1992 ; Watson , Schuchard , De l ' Aune , & Watkins , 2006 ) . Reading with Central Vision Loss Differences from normal reading . In normal reading , text projected onto the retina can be considered foveal , parafoveal , and peripheral . The fovea is a small area located in the center of the macula where cones are densely concentrated . This is the area that achieves the highest visual acuity , perceiving 2° of the visual field across the fixation point . Outside the fovea , acuity drops rapidly ( see Figure 2 ) . The parafovea expands to 10° beyond fixation , and everything extending from the parafovea is considered the periphery ( Rayner & Bertera , 1979 ) . For individuals with an obscured fovea , as is often the case in macular degeneration , reading often takes place in parafoveal or peripheral vision . Researchers who utilized artificial scotomas have demonstrated the significance of Figure 2 . Reading at the fovea , parafoveal , and periphery . 5 central fixation and the high - acuity fovea during reading . Using a foveal masking paradigm , Rayner , Inhoff , Morrison , Slowiaczek , and Bertera ( 1981 ) simulated central vision impairments with normally - sighted participants . As eyes navigated a line of text , researchers varied the number of masked characters in and around the central fovea . Findings demonstrated that obscuring even a single character could reduce reading speed by 50 % . Reading speed continued to decline as the number of masked characters grew . Legal blindness is defined at an acuity of 20 / 200 or worse , indicating vision that requires letters ten times the size necessary for someone with normal vision ( Rohrschneider , 2013 ) . When provided with adequate magnification , people with visual acuities as low as 20 / 2000 can read ( Legge , 2016 ) . When vision declines with greater retinal damage , however , magnification is no longer effective ( Chung , Mansfield , & Legge , 1998 ; Cummings & Rubin , 1992 ) . Further , encoding letters is not the only functional problem associated with central field loss . Patients with AMD and similar pathologies often read inaccurately and inefficiently due to navigational errors . For example , many patients have trouble seeing the left or right half of words due to a scotoma , and many accidentally skip lines after making regressive sweeps from one line to the next ( Fletcher et al . , 1999 ; Watson , Baldasare , & Whittaker , 1990 ) . This evidence suggests a fundamental difference in reading with peripheral vision compared to central vision . One explanation is that reading performance in peripheral vision is a function of oculomotor control . Precise , controlled eye movements are central to quick and efficient reading . In order to bring words into foveal vision , readers make saccades that span 7 - 9 letters between fixations as we move our eyes along a line of text ( Rayner , Slattery , & Belanger , 2010 ) . O’Regan ( 1971 ) called the landing position of the eyes on a word the 6 optimal viewing position ( OVP ) , typically at the center or left - center of a word , because it provides the most efficient processing of the word in one fixation . Because readers can still perceive letters outside the fovea , they do not need to fixate on every letter , or every word , in order to extract meaning . Using parafoveal information allows for more efficient reading because it allows readers to use information about the size and length of upcoming words to guide and execute eye movements ( Rayner , 1975 ) . Readers can also skip smaller function words ( e . g . , “a , ” “and” ) b y using parafoveal information ( Rayner et al . , 2010 ) . These precise eye movements are instrumental in efficient reading . When low vision readers must adjust to reading outside the fovea , however , eye movement control suffers ( White & Bedell , 1990 ) . Research by Peli ( 1986 ) suggests this could be due to a resistance to the natural inclination to fixate using the fovea . Because people with central field loss are using peripheral vision to read , they must learn new strategies to making fixations with extrafoveal parts of the retina . This causes reduced eye movement control and less efficient reading due to longer , more frequent fixations ( Kanonidou , 2011 ) and irregular saccadic eye movements . Studies employing reading tasks imply that those with central vision loss make more saccades while reading , including intra - word saccades ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , research on normally sighted samples shows that words can be processed with only one fixation ( Rubin , 2001 ; Crossland & Rubin , 2006 ) . Studies also suggest that readers with central field loss execute multiple fixations during regressive eye movements ( Rubin & Feely , 2009 ) . These regressions account for 10 - 15 % of saccades for readers with normal vision , and are usually accomplished in one eye movement ( Rayner , 1975 ) . 7 For normally sighted readers , eyes move roughly 7 - 9 characters in one saccade ( Rayner et al . , 2010 ) . Klitz , Legge , and Tjan ( 2000 ) studied how central scotomas contribute to changes in eye movement patterns during reading . Findings showed a relationship in which greater scotoma size was associated with shorter saccades , down to as few as 2 characters per saccade . The authors also found that fixation duration increased with a central scotoma , reducing reading speed by 55 % on average . Similar findings about the effect of scotoma size on saccades and reading speed were found by Rubin and Feely ( 2009 ) . If eye movements are a major contributing factor to increased reading speed , then removing or reducing eye movements should increase reading speed . Research using the rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP ) paradigm , which consists of words displayed individually to eliminate inter - word eye movements , has tested the hypothesis that eliminating saccades would improve reading speed for low vision readers . Evidence suggests only marginal benefits to reading speed for those with low vision ( Rubin & Turano , 1994 ) . These Figure 3 . From left to right : eye movements while reading with a full visual field , reading with a 3 . 5° simulated scotoma located one character space to the right of fixation , reading with a 3 . 5° simulated scotoma placed directly over fixation . Figure 4 . The normal visual span ( left ) and the visual span for those with a central scotoma ( right ) . 8 results suggest that oculomotor control does not appear to be the primary contributor to reading speed reductions in low vision . Legge et al . ( 1997 ) argue that a primary reason for the difference in reading speed observed between normal and low vision readers is a “shrinking” visual span ( Figure 4 ) . The visual span refers to the number of characters one can recognize while reading in a single fixation without moving their head . Legge et al . ’s research suggests that the visual span is significantly reduced in peripheral reading , and this impairment increases with eccentricity . By measuring visual span profiles of low vision patients , measures such as word recognition time and accuracy as a function of word length suggest the visual span substantially decreases as reading takes place farther from the fovea . Because so many low vision patients , especially those with AMD , must rely on eccentric reading , a smaller visual span could be a major contributor to impaired reading speed . Evidence suggests that AMD patients are slower with letter and word recognition tasks in peripheral vision than those with healthy eyes ( Crossland , Culham , & Rubin , 2005 ; Schotter , Angele , & Rayner , 2012 ) . Studies show that words outside the visual span are harder to read due to crowding of letters ( Bouma , 1970 ; Pelli et al . , 2007 ) . Reading in the periphery not only reduces acuity , but also reduces critical spacing between letters , or the space necessary to distinguish one letter from another . Because letters flanked by other characters will be harder to discriminate than isolated letters , reading with eccentric viewing techniques becomes difficult . The role of contrast sensitivity is particularly important for low vision readers . In the context of reading , contrast refers to the difference in luminance that distinguishes letters from their background ( Legge , Rubin , & Luebker , 1987 ) . As some readers rely on 9 contrast more than others for effective reading , it is important to understand the role contrast plays for patients with vision loss . Contrast is important for reading in two primary ways : contrast polarity ( light text on a dark background and the reverse ) and contrast magnitude ( Rubin & Legge , 1989 ) . For those with normal vision , contrast magnitude can be significantly reduced before affecting reading speed ( Legge et al . , 1987 ) . Readers with low vision , however , often require high contrast in order to achieve maximum reading speeds . Some eye pathologies also predispose certain people to read better with light text on a dark background . This has to do with abnormal light scatter in the eye ; because white backgrounds with dark texts produce more light scatter , better outcomes are achieved with dark backgrounds ( Legge , 2016 ) and this inverted display is frequently preferred by people with visual impairments ( Rohrschneider , 2013 ) . The importance of reading with low vision . Evidence suggests visual impairment severely affects patients’ enjoyment of reading . Johnson et al . ( 2014 ) found that while 96 % of visually impaired participants enjoyed reading prior to the onset of vision loss , only 36 % reported currently enjoying it . Similar results were found by Morrice , Johnson , Marinier , and Wittich ( 2017 ) . Decline in reading ability is cited by patients more than any other reason for visiting low vision clinics ( Casten , Rovner , & Fontenot , 2016 ; Elliott et al . , 1997 ; Rubin , 2013 ) . Figure 5 shows the prevalence of reading mentioned as a primary reason for the Figure 5 . Primary reasons for low vision clinic referrals ( Rubin , 2013 ) . 10 referral compared to other complaints . Crossland , Gould , Helman , Feely , and Rubin ( 2007 ) showed similar findings in a qualitative study that indicated 14 out of 15 patients cited reading difficulty as a primary concern . They also noted that being able to read more easily was the primary benefit participants reported after visiting a low vision clinic . A study of 1 , 000 patients from the Wilmer Low Vision clinic demonstrated that 64 % of patients reported reading as their primary concern . Activities other than reading were only reported by fewer than 8 % of patients ( Rubin , 2001 ) . As a result of the emphasis on reading improvements for low vision patients , reading performance is often used as a primary outcome measure for assessing the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program ( Binns et al . , 2012 ) . Questionnaires have been devised to measure reading performance ( Goodrich , Kirby , Wood , & Peters , 2006 ) following research indicating that reading ability is one of the most accurate predictors of patient - reported visual function ( McClure , Hart , Jackson , Stevenson , & Chakravarthy , 2000 ) . Impact on quality of life . Beyond measures of visual ability , reading performance has also been implicated as a reliable indicator of vision - related quality of life ( Hazel , Latham , Armstrong , Benson , & Frost , 2000 ) . Declining visual function often leads to reductions in patients’ ability to perform daily life activities , including spending time on hobbies and leisure . Giving up leisure activities is associated with diminished quality of life for those with AMD , even when controlling for the extent of impairment ( Mitchell , Bradley , Anderson , Ffytche , & Bradley , 2002 ) . Evidence collected by a questionnaire to assess the effect of macular disease on quality of life suggested that the domain of leisure activities is one of the most negatively affected by AMD ( Mitchell & Bradley , 2004 ) . A significant 11 portion of AMD patients report loss of valued activities after experiencing visual impairment , with reading being among the most commonly cited leisure activities to suffer ( Hassell , Lamoureux , & Keeffe , 2006 ; Mitchell & Bradley , 2006 ; Rovner & Casten , 2002 ) . Hassell et al . ( 2006 ) showed that tasks related to reading were the greatest concern AMD patients felt with their visual impairment , followed by a loss of “pastimes and lei sure activities . ” In another study , nearly 60 % of AMD patients experienced a reduction in the number of leisure activities due to visual impairment since the onset of their vision loss symptoms . Before diagnosis , 59 % of patients reported that they enjoyed reading . At the time of the study , this number had reduced to 20 % . Reading was the most afflicted hobby compared to all other activities ( Mitchell et al . , 2002 ) . Vision loss is also linked to a loss of independence , feelings of inadequacy , and reduced mental health ( Casten & Rovner , 2006 ; Casten et al . , 2016 ; Brody et al . , 2001 ) . In particular , research has demonstrated the significant risk of depression presented by AMD . One study of 51 patients with recently diagnosed AMD found that one third of patients exhibited symptoms of a depressive disorder at a 6 - month follow - up ( Rovner & Casten , 2002 ) . These rates are higher or comparable to those found in conditions such as coronary heart disease , stroke , and cancer ( Casten & Rovner , 2006 ) , and double the rates of non - institutionalized older adults ( Blazer , 2003 ) . The relationship between vision and depression ( as assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ) was also found to be mediated by relinquished valued activities like reading and driving ( Rovner & Casten , 2002 ) . In addition to a greater likelihood of depressive disorder , a three - year longitudinal study suggested loss of valued activities can place AMD patients at an 12 increased risk of cognitive decline ( Rovner , Casten , Leiby , & Tasman , 2009 ) , especially those affected by the disease earlier in life . The degree of impact on quality of life experienced by those with AMD is vastly underestimated , even by ophthalmologists and clinicians responsible for diagnosing and treating patients with the condition ( Mitchell & Bradley , 2006 ) . Brown et al . ( 2006 ) showed that patients diagnosed with moderate AMD experienced a 40 % reduction in quality of life , with very severe AMD patients reporting a 63 % decline . A lack of knowledge on the part of practitioners is concerning , especially considering evidence that referrals to low vision rehabilitation can improve quality of life and reading performance ( Hassell et al . , 2006 ) . There is also reason to believe fewer patients are referred to low vision rehabilitation services than should be ( Casten et al . , 2016 ; Hassell et al . , 2006 ) . Low Vision Rehabilitation Research by Hassell et al . ( 2006 ) suggested that referral to low vision services is often delayed until impairment is moderate or severe . This contradicts evidence that quality of life can be negatively impacted even when vision loss is minor , and that the relationship between psychological health and visual acuity is not linear ( Casten & Rovner , 2006 ; Hassell et al . , 2006 ) . In Hassell et al . ’s ( 2006 ) study , 75 % of patients had never received low vision services despite having moderate or severe visual impairment , many for over two years . 13 The value of rehabilitation . Findings on the impact of vision loss on quality of life and mental health have implications for how depression and loss of independence could be alleviated . Given the importance of maintaining hobbies and leisure activities , especially reading , aiding patients in preserving their ability to read is one potential aim of low vision services and rehabilitation . Some studies show improvements in reading ability and quality of life can be attained with the use of rehabilitation services and low vision aids ( Horowitz , Brennan , Reinhardt , & MacMillan , 2006 ; Mitchell & Bradley , 2006 ) , but evidence is mixed on psychological benefits ( Binns et al . , 2012 ) . The primary goal of any rehabilitation program is to increase patient independence and quality of life ( Deol , 2012 ) . Programs go beyond the conventional clinic visits that consist of vision evaluations and prescriptions of optical devices . Rehabilitation involves a broad range of services , including eye exams , prescription and training of low vision aids , training adaptive skills , and vocational counseling and training . A variety of professionals are involved in the rehabilitation process , such as ophthalmologists , optometrists , social workers , and occupational therapists ( Owsley , McGwin , Lee , Wasserman , & Searcey , 2009 ) . Research has suggested the effectiveness of low vision rehabilitation on reading ability ( Deemer , Massof , Rovner , Casten , & Piersol , 2017 ; Hamade , Hodge , Rakibuz - Zaman , & Malvankar - Mehta , 2016 ; Smallfield , Clem , & Myers , 2013 ) , effectiveness of low vision aids ( Hamade et al . , 2016 ; Horowitz et al . , 2006 ) , and patient satisfaction after appointments ( Binns et al . , 2012 ; Scott , Smiddy , Schiffman , Feuer , & Pappas , 1999 ) . Conventional optometric serv ices include appointments that establish a patient’s functional goals , a low vision evaluation , and prescription and demonstration of low vision aids for reading . A key aspect of rehabilitation includes further training with low vision 14 aids ( Deol , 2012 ) . Provision and training with low vision aids has demonstrated greater visual function ( Margrain , 2000 ; Scott et al . , 1999 ) and psychological health ( Grant - Jordan et al . , 2006 , Horowitz et al . , 2006 ) than those who do not take part . Low vision aids . Most low vision patients require enlarged print to read effectively . The optimal text size tends to be approximately 4 times the acuity limit of the reader . Patients with conditions like AMD who experience central field loss often require greater magnification than their counterparts without central scotomas . Comparatively , patients with central scotomas exhibit slower reading speeds than those with intact central fields , even when adequate magnification is provided ( Rubin , 2001 ) . Although reading speed and accuracy cannot be entirely restored , patients with conditions like AMD use a variety of devices to improve their reading ability . The most common low vision aids ( LVAs ) are optical magnifiers , which can be handheld or mounted on spectacles or a stand ( Figure 6 ) , and frequently include a light to illuminate text material ( Rohrschneider , 2013 ; Watson , Stelmack , Maino , & Long , 1997 ) . Magnifiers are convenient because they allow patients to read a wide variety of content such as books , mail , and medicine labels . Stand magnifiers also allow patients to glide the magnification across text , requiring less Figure 7 . Portable electronic magnifier . Figure 6 . Stand magnifier . 15 fine motor control and strain on the hand and wrist compared to a handheld magnifier ( Virgili , Acosta , Grover , Bentley , & Giacomelli , 2013 ) . Another commonly prescribed device is an electronic magnifier . Electronic magnifiers can be portable ( Figure 7 ) or desktop devices such as closed circuit televisions ( CCTVs ) ( Figure 8 ) . CCTVs include a screen that presents magnified text captured by a fixed downward - facing video camera from material placed on a sliding surface ( Genensky et al . , 1974 ) . Electronic devices provide a monitor or screen that adds a greater opportunity for magnification and contrast . Customization is also a key benefit of electronic devices , where features like magnification and text colors can be changed ( Rohrschneider , 2013 ) . For example , some patients with AMD prefer to change the contrast polarity of text material . Using electronic magnifiers , patients could read a book with black text on a white background or white text on a black background . Studies thus far suggest optical magnifiers are more commonly selected as LVAs ( Casten et al . , 2016 ; Rao , Monira , & Chowdhury , 2013 ) , but evidence has emerged that electronic devices may be more preferred ( Feng et al . , 2017 ; Taylor et al . , 2017 ) and lead to better performance outcomes ( Peterson et al . , 2003 ) than conventional magnifiers . One study by Taylor et al . ( 2017 ) showed that portable electronic magnifiers showed no significant differences for reading speed compared to optical LVAs , but were preferred by 70 % of patients , allowed for more independence in completing tasks , and reported as easier to use than the optical devices . Patients reported that their optical Figure 8 . Desktop CCTV . 16 devices were still used for more tasks and used more frequently than the electronic system . Effectiveness and satisfaction with LVAs . Use of LVAs has been shown to contribute to greater reading ability and satisfaction . ( de Carvalho , Monteiro , Isaac , Shiroma , & Amaral , 2004 ; Margrain , 2000 ; Temel , 1989 ) . Measuring differences in outcomes between types of reading aids has shown less consistency ( Virgili et al . , 2013 ) . A study by Culham , Chabra , and Rubin ( 2004 ) found that stand or hand optical LVAs were superior to head - mounted electronic devices for improving reading speed . Conversely , Peterson , Wolffsohn , Rubinstein , & Lowe ( 2003 ) reported that a CCTV and other electronic devices were significantly better than the patient’s own optical device . Matchinski and Winters ( 2016 ) compared desktop CCTVs to portable electronic magnifiers . Findings suggested that desktop CCTVs provided greater ease and faster reading rates than portable electronic magnifiers . Research has also been conducted to understand patient satisfaction with their reading devices . Most studies have found general satisfaction to be high with LVAs ( Feridooni , GhassemiBroumand , & Tabatabaeei , 2013 ; Reeves , Harper , & Russell , 2004 ; Rohrschneider , Kiel , Pavlovska , & Blankenagel , 2002 ) . Often times , satisfaction is measured via single scales ( Watson et al . , 2005 ) or as part of a standardized questionnaire assessing quality of life , value gained by the LVA , and / or ease of use ( Reeves et al . , 2004 ) . More commonly , studies comparing multiple devices will include a measure of patient preference for one device over another ( Culham , Chabra , & Rubin , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2017 ) , or compared to their typical method ( Peterson et al . , 2003 ; Walker , Bryan , Harvey , Riazi , & Anderson , 2016 ) . Studies sometimes include satisfaction measures for one device of 17 interest . For example , one study examined the satisfaction and use of CCTVs for three years after the initial prescription ( Strong , Jutai , Bevers , Hartley , & Plotkin , 2003 ) . Findings showed a great positive initial impact for low vision patients , but that this effect declined after the second year . The authors speculated that a recalibration occurs after initial use that could be caused by changes in the patient ’ s vision or their functional needs . Satisfaction with LVAs appears to be affected by numerous factors . Martin , Martin , Stumbo , and Morrill ( 2011 ) explored the effects of feeling informed and involved in the decision process when selecting assistive technologies are important mechanisms that influence satisfaction with devices . Results showed that feeling informed and involved were significantly related to satisfaction , and that many factors contribute to individuals feeling informed . For example , feeling like they were presented with a comprehensive list of options for devices and speaking with other users . Draffan , James , Cudd , and Bentley ( 2015 ) demonstrated similar findings with the additions of factors like ease of use , social support , and affordability . LVA abandonment . Several studies have shown frequent and prolonged usage of LVAs following provision ( Reeves et al . , 2004 ; Watson , De l ' Aune , Stelmack , Maino , & Long , 1997 ) . While many patients find greater psychological and functional improvement after using LVAs , some research shows a relatively high rate of abandonment of assistive devices . A national survey reported rates of abandonment near 30 % for assistive devices for a variety of assistive devices ( Phillips & Zhao , 2003 ) , with abandonment appearing especially likely within the first year and after five years of use . Riemer - Reiss and Wacker ( 2000 ) found similar results with slightly over 30 % abandonment . One study particularly concerned with low vision devices showed that 19 % of patients had not used their device 18 in the previous three months . Interestingly , abandonment of the LVA was not associated with age , time since prescription , visual acuity , or type of LVA ( Dougherty et al . , 2011 ) . Evidence suggested device abandonment was associated with visual field loss . Research on abandonment suggests that patients will not continue to use the device unless they perceive the benefits of using the device supersede the burdens involved with its use . Factors associated with abandonment of assistive technologies often include lack of involvement in selection of the device ( Riemer - Reiss & Wacker , 2000 ) , difficulty using the device , dissatisfaction with the device meeting their needs and functional goals , inadequate device performance , and high costs ( Batavia & Hammer , 1990 ) . These are detriments that can often be identified and discussed prior to the prescription of the device . The role of awareness . Researchers have speculated on the impact of patient awareness and training on LVA abandonment . While a common complaint is that devices are no t performing to patients’ expectations ( Deol , 2012 ) , a more likely explanation aligns with the common finding about the early stages of the low vision service process contributing to assistive technology satisfaction ( Martin et al . , 2011 ) . For example , while any low vision patient is eligible to receive rehabilitation that would involve exposure to and training with LVAs , only a small number of the entire patient population do so . That low vision rehabilitation services are underutilized is a consistent finding ( Deol , 2012 ; Pollard , Simpson , Lamoureux , & Keeffe , 2003 ; Keeffe , Lovie - Kitchin , & Taylor , 1996 ; Southall & Wittich , 2012 ) . One reason for this underutilization could be that patients are unaware of the services available , or are unsure how to access them . Focus groups conducted by the National Eye Institute ( cited in Casten , Maloney , & Rovner , 2005 ) suggested that many low 19 vision patients have little to no knowledge of the services available to educate and train them about devices that could improve their reading ability and quality of life . As a result , few patients were utilizing the services . One study reported that only 19 % of individuals who qualified for low vision rehabilitation were familiar with the services , and only 12 % of respondents had taken part in these services ( Walter , Althouse , Humble , Leys , & Odom , 2004 ) . Similar results have been found in countries other than the United States . A study of low vision patients in Quebec , Canada revealed that accessibility of rehabilitation is also an issue , wherein 28 % of patients surveyed were aware of how to access services ( Overbury & Wittich , 2011 ) . Only 20 % of all eligible patients took advantage of rehabilitation . Casten et al . ( 2005 ) showed that while 83 % of older adult low vision patients were interested in low vision rehabilitation , only 24 % were aware of the option , and 13 % used services . Specific to LVAs , while 100 % of patients were aware of magnifiers and 82 % used them , only 50 % were aware of CCTVs and 11 % used them . This shows a discrepancy in the potential devices being demonstrated to patients . Strong et al . ( 2003 ) mentioned similar patterns in the presentation of CCTVs to those with low vision , in which these devices were prescribed less than traditional magnifiers , and clinicians underrepresented the breadth of features of CCTVs when demonstrating the device to patients . Research points to the need for healthcare professionals to make their patients more aware of the services and reading devices available to them . Studies have found that optometrists and ophthalmologists only refer a fraction of those eligible to receive rehabilitation ( Greenblatt , 1988 ) . Leinhaas and Massof ( 2001 ) revealed that only 15 % of ophthalmologists and 21 % of optometrists frequently prescribed LVAs , and 44 % of 20 ophthalmologists and 27 % of optometrists frequently recommended that patients receive further low vision services . Lack of knowledge or access to services can lead to low device usage by low vision patients . Casten et al . ( 2016 ) studied the functional goals of patients with AMD and the devices they were using to reach those goals . The most common functional goal reported was to read the newspaper . Almost 30 % of patients with that goal read using a handheld magnifier . The next most common device was a bright light . While almost 90 % of patients reported that the task was easier when u sing the LVA , 40 % felt the device was “very difficult” to use , and nearly 92 % reported that they read the newspaper less frequently after being diagnosed with AMD . Less than 10 % of the sample in Casten’s ( 2016 ) study indicated they had received low vision rehabilitation , so it is likely the devices were selected via resources other than low vision specialists . In this case , sub - optimal resources may be used and patients are likely not trained to use them properly . Perhaps as a result , one of the most concerning findings from this study was that of the 72 people who named reading the newspaper as a primary goal , only 50 % of them were using a device to do so . A survey by the Glaskow Eye Infirmary showed similar results , reporting that 33 % of patients never used their LVA ( McIlwaine , Bell , & Dutton , 1991 ) . The Lighthouse National Survey on Vision Loss revealed that only 30 % of patients with low vision were using optical reading devices , 21 % were using large - print reading materials , and only 6 % received rehabilitation services . Participants’ lack of awareness about the LVAs and rehabilitation services was the most commonly cited reason for not utilizing their benefits ( Lighthouse Inc . , 1995 ) . 21 The role of training . Beyond awareness of devices and services , the training implemented for LVAs is not always adequate . Many consultations with optometrists and ophthalmologists often consist of simple demonstrations of the prescribed devices , then patients depart with a prescription and are expected to learn to effectively use their device with practice ( Deol . 2012 ) . Studies have shown that rehabilitation with an occupational therapist beyond typical optometric services is more advantageous for AMD patients than optometric services alone ( Deemer et al . , 2017 ; Smallfield et al . , 2013 ) . Shuttleworth , Dunlop , Collins , and James ( 1995 ) demonstrated that when providing additional training to patients , satisfaction with the clinic experience also improves dramatically . Similar results were found in a survey by McIlwain et al . ( 1991 ) . Results indicated that one third of patients never used their LVA and only half were satisfied with their low vision service . The authors concluded that lack of training for LVA use was an important indicator of satisfaction and long term device use . Nilsson ( 1990 ) compared a group of elderly AMD patients that only received instruction by a clinician on how to use their reading device at a proper distance to a group that received formal training in device use and eccentric reading ( practice reading using a retinal location outside the fovea ) by a low vision therapist . Results at a one - month follow - up indicated that 100 % of patients in the trained group could read newspaper text compared to 25 % in the untrained group . Reading speeds also improved from 0 to 75 . 5 and 22 . 6 WPM for the trained group and the untrained group , respectively . Similarly , improvements to reading performance in the clinic do not necessarily translate to improvements when patients use LVAs on their own ( Nilsson & Nilsson , 1986 ; Leat , Fryer , 22 & Rumney , 1994 ) . Training is necessary to achieve optimal results and avoid device abandonment . In a study with 50 low vision patients , 62 % had been prescribed LVAs ( de Carvalho , Monteiro , Temporini , & Kara - Jose , 2005 ) , and only slightly over half used them for everyday reading . Just over 70 % of participants reported that the LVAs met their expectations . A number of participants claimed they had not received a prescription for a device when they had . These results underscore the importance of spending time explaining devices and giving patients a chance to experience the potential improvements afforded by LVAs . Studies have shown the value in meeting with low vision experts in the training and continued use of LVAs ( Copolillo & Teitelman , 2005 ) . Goodrich , Mehr , Quillman , Shaw , and Wiley ( 1977 ) also showed that numerous hours are necessary to ensure effective use of reading aids . With devices like magnifiers , much of this training goes toward physical manipulation of the device and motor skills . It is clear that additional training is recommended for optimal results ( Demirkilinç , Palamar , & Üretmen , 2013 ; Deol , 2012 ; Strong et al . , 2003 ) . Even so , most patients are not receiving rehabilitation that would provide them with more knowledge and skills for reading . Recommendations for practitioners . After noticing the rate at which patients are offered rehabilitation , Deol ( 2012 ) provided guidelines for comprehensive rehabilitation services . One of the first steps is to ensure the patient is exposed to as many potential devices as possible . Even if some LVAs are inappropriate given the results of the visual exam , demonstrating why this may be the case is helpful for the patient to understand their 23 visual condition . It also allows them the confidence in their familiarity with many options before making the important decision about which device to use . Corn ( 2000 ) also argues that the decision of which devices to show participants is in the hands of the low vision practitioner . As a result , people with low vision are often bound to the devices deemed appropriate by their doctors or occupational therapists and are consequently left in the dark about other potential selections . Strong et al . ( 2003 ) suggests the patient is the only one who can truly decide if the device will work for them . The only way to accurately evaluate an LVA’s efficacy is to allow the patient hands - on experience with the device . Strong et al . ( 2003 ) quotes : “ The advice of a low vision optometrist or an assistive technology specialist is often valuable , but it is the person with the disability who ultimately chooses to use the magnifier or let it gather dust . ” Problems with common LVAs . Despite their undeniable value to individuals with vision loss , research has pointed out practical issues associated with their use among an older visually impaired population . Rogers and Holm ( 1992 ) reported that LVA dissatisfaction and abandonment often occurs in part as a result of the device feeling “awkward , heavy , or defective . ” Magnifiers often require manual movement of the device across a page of text , which can become burdensome and heavy , especially in the case of handheld magnifiers . Even when using CCTVs , the reader must move a sliding plane under the camera in order to piece together the entirety of the page on the screen . Field of view is a frequently cited issue with common LVAs ( Fine , Kirschen , & Peli , 1996 ; Lovie - Kitchin & Woo , 1988 ; Lowe & Drasdo , 1990 ; Whittaker & Lovie - Kitchin , 1993 ) . For efficient reading , the number of characters that can be viewed at once contributes to reading speed ( Legge , Rubin , Pelli , & Schleske , 1985 ) . For printed text , as many as 15 - 30 24 letters are necessarily visible for reading speeds to reach their maximum , compared to 4 - 5 letters for text that automatically scrolls across a screen . This finding suggests that when reading involves manual page navigation , the window width requirements increase . Magnification devices increase text size while reducing the field of view , limiting the number of characters presented to the reader and slowing reading speed . An example of the field of view problem can be illustrated by screen magnifiers . This software is typically used on desktop computers and involves high magnification of a small piece of the text at a time . The reader then typically uses their mouse to scroll across lines of reading material ( Legge , 2016 ) . One participant in a qualitative study by Hallett et al . ( 2015 ) described using a screen magnifier as “reading through a straw” as a result of the high magnification required . This resulted in higher navigational demands and an overall more negative reading experience . Methods like this can also result in physical strain , as readers sometimes have to slouch or hunch over to get closer to the screen ( Hallett et al . , 2015 ) . Cost and social acceptance are also barriers to adopting LVAs . Devices are often expensive , and many low vision patients are already on a limited income due to their disability and age ( Köberlein , Beifus , Schaffert , & Finger , 2013 ) . Handheld and stand magnifiers are the most affordable , with most available for less than $ 75 . Reading glasses and monocular telescopes can range from $ 100 – $ 200 , and electronic magnification devices like portable / desktop CCTVs or head mounted video magnifiers can range from $ 300 to $ 3 , 500 ( Corn & Erin , 2010 ) . Patients may not be able to justify the economic cost of a LVA , especially if the benefits are not effectively demonstrated to them in rehabilitation . Some low vision patients also feel a social stigma associated with using a reading device in public . 25 Using the device around other people draws attention to their disability and patients fear stereotypes being applied to them ( Southall & Wittich , 2012 ; Watson , Maino , & De l’aune , 2005 ) . Digital Reading Formats Benefits of tablets and e - readers as LVAs . A solution to many of the drawbacks of optical and video magnifiers may be digital devices like tablets and e - readers . These devices offer several practical benefits over traditional reading aids . For instance , tablets may negate worries about social stigma and stereotypes that low vision readers often report ( Southall & Wittich , 2012 ; Watson et al . , 2005 ) . They are also designed for portability and convenience , so readers are more able and willing to use them in public and in the company of others . Using magnifiers often relegates low vision readers to specific locations in the household : a desk where a large device like a CCTV would be used or a particular seat next to special lighting required for the patient to read optimally ( Casten et al . , 2016 ) . Tablets and e - readers offer portable versions of the high - resolution displays of a CCTV , and offer numerous free applications to make their use more accessible . Tablets also afford multiple functions . Low vision patients could use tablets as a primary reading device that could hold thousands of books , but could also complete most functions that can be carried out on a typical computer . Many tablets also include cameras , and many patients also report using the pinch and zoom features of device cameras as a magnifier to enlarge printed text ( Crossland , Silva , & Macedo , 2014 ; Irvine et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe , Yamaguchi , & Minatani , 2015 ) . Basic tablets and e - readers are also more affordable than many common LVAs . Kindles can be purchased for under $ 100 compared to $ 500 - $ 3 , 000 for many video 26 magnifiers . The cost of books in electronic formats are also often less expensive than purchasing the same book in print , and a large selection of e - books can be downloaded for free ( Bunkell & Dyas - Correia , 2009 ; Wischenbart , Kovač , Carrenho , Licher , & Mallya , 2013 ) . While many optical and electronic magnifiers considerably limit the field of view when text is magnified to the necessary size for the patient , tablets and e - readers can offer more screen real estate . A wide range of products in the tablet / e - reader category allow users to choose a device that best suits their needs . Kindles , for example , can range from 6 - inch to 10 - inch diagonal screens . Tablets have more variability , with some models offering screens up to 20 inches ( Crossland , Macedo , & Rubin , 2010 ) . For low vision readers that require a relatively high degree of magnification , screen space is essential for achieving maximum speed and ensuring a larger field of view . This is a primary benefit of large screen desktop CCTVs , which are cumbersome and expensive compared to tablets and e - readers . Only 1 . 5 % of print books are converted to large print formats that enable those with low vision to read ( Lockyer , Creaser , & Davies , 2005 ) . On tablets , apps like Kindle , iBooks , and Google Play Books can be downloaded to read a multitude of content . In addition to the over 3 . 5 million electronic books in the Kindle store ( Crossland et al . , 2014 ) , the Kindle app allows readers to subscribe to newspapers and magazines , and borrow books from their local libraries or Kindle’s lending library . In addition to adjusting text size , electronic devices allow for many features of text to be customized to the user’s preference . The Kindle e - reader , for example , allows users to adjust features such as line spacing , typeface , and margins . Some limited evidence has shown that increased line spacing can be beneficial for readers with AMD , who are 27 particularly subject to the adverse effects of crowding in peripheral reading ( Calabrese et al . , 2010 ; Blackmore - Wright , Georgeson , & Anderson , 2013 ) . Mainstream e - reading apps also allow users to adjust the color of the text and background , and adjust alignment and text layout ( e . g . , one column or two per page ) . With the growing accessibility of digital devices , font style for low vision has been a subject of research . Studies have attempted to provide some general guidelines for typeface for readers with central vision loss . For example , best performance may occur using fixed - width typefaces ( Tarita - Nistor , Brent , Steinbach , Markowitz , & Gonzalez , 2013 ) . An example of a fixed - width style is Courier , in which the same horizontal space is occupied for each letter . This font style includes the advantage of uniform spacing around narrow letters , unlike variable - width styles . Attempting to generate consistent guidelines for low vision reading has proven to be a challenge due to the high variability in clinical and functional symptoms ( Legge , 2016 ) . Tablets and e - readers allow users to choose from a variety of typefaces , which is essential for this high variability population . Bowers , Meek , and Stewart ( 2001 ) also showed the impact of illumination for reading with AMD . They reported that highest performance was attained when lighting was substantially higher than page illumination in a typical home or clinical setting . Many tablets and e - readers include a backlit screen that could potentially negate the need for additional lamps and allow users to read easily in dark environments . An important note is that a great deal of variation exists with these devices in terms of features , hardware , and price . For example , early versions of the Kindle did not provide a backlit screen , so readers were subjected to lower contrast than with more recent models . As opposed to earlier models , some Kindles now also provide matte screens that allow for a reduction of glare as 28 a result of environmental light sources ( Crossland et al . , 2010 ) . Glare is a primary issue for many patients with conditions like AMD ( Whittaker & Lovie - Kitchin , 1994 ) , and even traditional tablets offer separate decals that can be applied to the screen to reduce glare . Research on digital reading formats for low vision . Given their evident practical benefits , recent research has examined the objective benefits of tablets and e - readers for low vision . In particular , a number of studies have assessed the iPad as a low vision reading aid . Results have shown that iPads improve reading speed compared to printed text ( Gill , Mao , Powell , & Sheidow , 2013 ; Roth et al . , 2012 ) and maintain or exceed reading speeds to CCTVs and patients’ typical magnification device ( Johnson et al . , 2014 ; Leng et al . , 2017 ; Morrice et al . , 2017 ) . Haji , Sambhav , Grover , and Chalam ( 2015 ) showed that iPads allowed 94 % of patients to read standard newspaper print using a browser zoom feature compared to 22 % using eyeglasses alone . In a qualitative study , Mednick , Jaidka , Nesdole , and Bona ( 2017 ) found that after an initial training course , using an iPad improved low vision patients’ sense of independence and social connectivity , and that most were still using the iPad daily at a 3 - month follow - up . Another training study showed that after 10 weekly sessions , daily tablet use by patients with acuities from 20 / 160 to 20 / 4000 increased from 15 minutes ( pretest ) to three hours ( posttest ) and 4 . 5 hours at a 3 - month follow - up . Evidence also shows that reading speed on an iPad may improve with practice ( Morrice et al . , 2017 ) . These studies are important for demonstrating that training and experience are important for low vision readers to gain the most benefit from the devices and that performance and usage duration on tablets can increase with time . 29 Gill et al . ( 2013 ) compared an iPad , a Sony e - reader , and printed text . Reading with the iPad resulted in faster speeds than reading with paper , and paper proved to be faster than the e - reader . Subjective results showed that low vision readers preferred the iPad for text clarity , but preferred paper for ease of use . Feng et al . ( 2017 ) compared printed text , iPads , and Kindles at 12 and 18 - point font across patients with varying visual acuities . Results showed that the iPad at a higher font size led to greater comfort and improved reading speed , and those with the lowest visual acuity benefitted most from this method . Across all methods tested , most patients preferred the iPad at 18 - point font . Their results suggest the benefit of back - illuminated devices over traditional print . Usage of digital reading formats by those with low vision . Although recent research has demonstrated the benefit of digital devices for low vision reading , limited research has been done regarding their use in this population . While studies show that older adults ( Pew Research Center , 2014 ) and those with low vision ( Crossland et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2015 ) are using devices such as tablets and e - readers , few older adults with visual impairments report using them as a primary reading device ( Casten et al . , 2016 ) . Crossland et al . ( 2014 ) found that out of 132 people with low vision surveyed , 48 % of respondents used a tablet device . Of tablet owners , 60 % used them to read electronic books . The most common reason for not owning a tablet was cost ( 36 % of those who did not own a tablet ) followed by lack of interest ( 14 % ) . Only 17 % of the sample reported owning an e - reader device . Reasons given for not owning an e - reader included lack of interest ( 29 % of non - owners ) , never thinking of getting one ( 17 % ) , thinking they would not be able to use one ( 13 % ) , and thinking they would be too expensive ( 12 % ) . 30 Crossland et al . ( 2014 ) reported that a significant portion of those with low vision are unaware that people with visual impairments can use tablet and e - reader devices . Major barriers to using the devices included cost , lack of awareness of their usefulness , and never considering using them . More problematically , the majority of people sampled did not gain familiarity about the devices from clinicians ( 2 % ) or rehabilitation specialists ( 5 % ) . Similar findings were reported in a study of accessibility features offered by iPhones and iPads ( Robinson , Braimah Avery , Chun , Pusateri , & Jay , 2017 ) . In their sample of 33 , 63 % of low vision patients were self - taught in their use of iPads and iPhones , 12 % received training from an Apple store associate , while only 12 % were trained on the device by eye care professionals . Perhaps as a result of the lack of formal training , results also indicated that many patients who own these devices are largely unaware of their full capabilities . Several low vision researchers have postulated that reading books electronically will be the “next wave” in reading rehabilitation with an increasingly aging population ( Crossland et al . , 2010 ; Gill et al . , 2013 ; Ryan , 2014 ) . However , findings point to the low representation tablets and e - readers likely receive in optometric and rehabilitation services . Drawing awareness to these devices may increase the likelihood of their use among the low vision population , and may help to dispel misconceptions patients carry about their utility , ease of use , and affordability . Researchers strongly urge eye care and rehabilitation professionals to emphasize that these devices can be advantageous to people with visual impairments ( Casten et al . , 2016 ; Crossland et al . , 2014 ; Gill et al . , 2013 ; Robinson et al . , 2017 ) . Problems with digital formats . Some issues with portable devices as reading aids are worth mentioning . While the screen size of many devices affords a larger field of view 31 than many traditional LVAs , some patients with severe vision loss require greater magnification than can be comfortably achieved on a tablet screen . Although some tablet models offer extra large screen sizes , this comes at the expense of the portability , convenience , and lightweight of smaller devices ( Crossland et al . , 2010 ; Legge , 2016 ) . While the amount of reading material available in electronic formats is growing , tablets and e - readers provide little value when reading printed sources . Many people with low vision use magnifiers to read content like mail and restaurant menus , important instances of reading in which digital devices may not be able to assist as effectively . Instead , their primary benefit would likely be for those who enjoy reading for pleasure . Page navigation may still be an issue when reading with tablets and e - readers . Although the devices offer high resolution and numerous ways to customize text , many readers with conditions like AMD complain of the difficulty associated with accurately moving their eyes across a line of text and making sweeping regressive eye movements from one line to the next ( Fletcher et al . , 1999 ) . Although features like customized line spacing may help , reading on portable devices will likely not aid in resolving navigational difficulties . However , a number of alternative text presentation strategies have been proposed to alleviate these common setbacks . Dynamic Formats Due to low vision readers’ saccade instability and low visual acuity , research has considered dynamic reading techniques that could remedy difficulties in text navigation for those with low vision . Rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP ) and scrolling are two methods that have been studied in hopes of improving reading performance , especially for those with central field loss . 32 Reading with RSVP carries an intuitive benefit in that readers can keep their eyes in a fixed position while reading instead of making saccades from one word to the next . Using the RSVP method , individual words are presented in succession on a screen , usually in large print ( Potter , 1984 ) . Isolated words provide the benefit of reduced eye movements required to navigate a line of text , which researchers hypothesized would yield improved reading speeds compared to static text for individuals with vision loss ( Rubin & Turano , 1994 ) . Rubin and Turano ( 1994 ) demonstrated that readers with AMD did read approximately 50 % faster with RSVP compared to a traditional static presentation . However , normally sighted readers showed significantly more benefit reading with RSVP than the AMD sample . In addition to showing only modest improvements to reading performance , studies have pointed out further disadvantages to reading with RSVP . Regressive eye movements are an integral part of reading for accurate word recognition overall comprehension . Because individual words are automatically displayed when using RSVP , this important task of reviewing previous text is not permitted ( Just , Carpenter , & Woolley , 1982 ) . Readers with visual impairments like AMD also tend to make intra - word saccades , diminishing the potential advantage of reading each word with a single fixation ( Rubin , 2001 ) . RSVP has also performed poorly on subjective ratings of reading satisfaction in studies of readers with normal vision ( Benedetto et al . , 2015 ) . Reading with RSVP seems intuitively promising for those with low vision . The single - word presentation affords greater maximization of screen space , so higher magnification can be reached compared to a traditional paragraph presentation . There is also evidence to suggest that RSVP reading speeds improve with training ( Aquilante , Yager , 33 & Morris , 1999 ) , and when longer words are presented for longer durations than shorter words ( Aquilante , Yager , Morris , and Khmelnitsky , 2001 ) . Aquilante et al ( 2001 ) found that when presentation duration is adjusted according to word length , participants with central field loss showed an average of 33 % faster reading compared to reading with RSVP at a consistent speed . Together , these findings suggest that novelty may play some part in the reduced subjective ratings observed with RSVP , and that better results ( in both performance and preference ) may be attained if RSVP is presented in a way that mimics typical reading patterns . Arditi ( 1999 ) explored a method called elicited sequential presentation ( ESP ) for low vision readers . When reading with ESP , words are presented in isolation , similar to RSVP . The difference in ESP is that each word is elicited by the reader by pushing a button or tapping on a screen . The idea behind ESP is that readers have complete control over the pace of the text flow , whereas RSVP reading typically involves an automatic , predetermined rate per word . Results of Arditi’s ( 1999 ) study showed that reading speed improved by an average of 47 % compared to RSVP with low vision readers . When considering which reading method may be optimal for a particular patient , an important distinction may exist between severities of visual impairment . Findings from comparing ESP and RSVP suggested slower readers may show a greater advantage when given full control of the text pace than faster readers . Depending on the degree to which reading performance is affected , Arditi’s study supports the idea that the best reading method should be decided ba sed on the individual’s needs . Some studies have compared RSVP reading rates with a scrolling method , in which text flows continuously in a single line from the right to the left of the screen ( Legge et al . , 34 1985 ) . The scroll method is thought to be beneficial to those with AMD because it reduces the navigational demands of holding a magnifier with a limited field of view , and reduces the need for regressive eye movements between lines . Fine and Peli ( 1995 ) showed discrepancies between normally sighted and low vision readers using scroll and RSVP . In their study , readers with normal vision demonstrated significant reading speed improvements with RSVP compared to scroll . Reading speed for low vision participants , however , did not favor either method . When Fine and Peli ( 1998 ) tested RSVP and scroll with varied text sizes , however , low vision participants performed better with RSVP than scroll when the text size was eight times larger than their acuity threshold . Four of the 20 low vision subjects also demonstrated their fastest reading speeds when reading scrolling text , once again suggesting the importance of considering the high variability and individual differences observed in low vision reading . Mixed results for dynamic methods were also found by Bowers , Woods , and Peli ( 2004 ) . Researchers assessed the reading performance of individuals with central field loss using four dynamic presentation techniques . Participants read with RSVP , horizontal scroll ( text drifting automatically from the right to the left of the screen ) , vertical scroll ( text drifting automatically from the bottom to the top of the screen ) , and page ( a static multi - line format ) . Their study revealed that although low vision subjects showed no advantage to any method in terms of performance , half of the 35 low vision individuals sampled preferred to read with horizontal scroll . Similar findings were demonstrated by Harvey and Walker ( 2014 ) in a study of normally sighted readers using simulated scotomas . Participants made more errors reading static text compared to horizontal scroll , but no advantage in reading speed was found . 35 These results echo previous findings ( Goodrich & Kirby , 2001 ) of a divergence between reading performance and method preference , and suggest that preference , in addition to performance , should be considered when evaluating reading options for low vision patients . Bowers et al . ( 2004 ) also conclude : “…t he lack of a relationship between reading rates and preferred display format reinforce the importance of patient preference in the evaluation and selection of a device or display format during rehabilitation ” ( p . 212 ) . Results for normally sighted readers showed fastest reading speeds with RSVP compared to the other three methods . These results are consistent with previous findings by Fine and Peli ( 1995 ) that suggest dynamic methods may benefit normally sighted readers more than those with low vision . Similar findings were demonstrated by Harland , Legge , and Luebker ( 1998 ) . While participants with normal vision read faster with scrolling and RSVP compared to with a CCTV , subjects with central field loss showed no performance difference across methods . However , an interesting finding from this study illustrated that low vision patients with intact central fields showed improvement similar to the normal vision group , reading faster with both scroll and RSVP . Recent research has also explored dynamic formats with modern technology . Walker et al . ( 2016 ) measured reading performance , preference , and various contributors to satisfaction for an iPad application that employs a horizontal scrolling presentation for reading e - books Figure 9 . Scrolling app designed by Walker et al . ( 2016 ) . 36 ( Figure 9 ) . When using the app , readers with AMD will ideally experience less perceptual crowding and fewer saccadic eye movements . Readers also have the ability to customize features such as contrast polarity , text size , and scrolling speed . Results of an initial study suggested participants performed at least equally as well using the scrolling app compared to static text with respect to reading speed and comprehension . On assessments of satisfaction with the reading experience , low vision readers rated the app highly when asked for their likelihood of using the app as a long - term reading tool , overall quality ratings , and whether the app would encourage them to read more . Participants also indicated an overall preference for the scrolling app over their typical method . Because performance measures showed no particular benefit for either the scrolling or static text , this study further illustrates the importance of reader preference and satisfaction in low vision reading . Rationale for the Present Research Walker et al . ’s ( 2016 ) research is one of few studies aimed at measuring reading satisfaction as opposed to primarily measuring performance . The majority of work in low vision reading is focused on enhancing comprehension , speed , and accuracy . While these are undeniably important elements of the entire reading experience , satisfaction and preference have been largely discounted in the literature . Studies have also shown a discrepancy between clinical presentation and functional reading experience ( Mangione et al . , 1998 ; Wren et al . , 2009 ) and satisfaction with rehabilitation and LVAs ( Hill , 2004 ; Steinburg et al . , 1994 ) . Researchers agree there exists a need to focus more on subjective experience and satisfaction ( Bowers et al . , 2004 ; Hill , Aspinall , & Cotton , 2004 ; Longenecker Rust & Smith , 2004 ; Virgili et al . , 2013 ) . 37 A considerable amount of research has modeled constructs that contribute to satisfaction and acceptance of assistive technologies , suggesting the complexity of predicting which aids will lead to the best outcomes for each patient ( Draffan et al . , 2015 ; Martin et al . , 2011 ) . Studies have also suggested that performance and preference for text presentations are not always linked ( Bowers et al . , 2004 ; Harland et al . , 1998 ) , indicating that factors other than observable visual characteristics may be at work in determining satisfaction and use of reading strategies . For example , research shows that time and practice are ideal for attaining positive outcomes with LVAs ( Deol , 2012 ; Goodrich et al . , 1977 ) . Research also suggests awareness may be a barrier to receiving training and gaining exposure to possible reading devices ( Demirkilinç et al . , 2013 ) . Few studies have examined the role of the initial LVA device selection and training process in determining device use and satisfaction . In particular , most research on LVA use and satisfaction has not included modern electronic devices as primary devices for reading , despite their demonstrated benefit to low vision readers . Given the importance of reading and its impact on quality of life for those with low vision , the present research focuses on improving and encouraging leisure reading in this population . To address the gaps in the literature mentioned above , the present work incorporates multiple methods to understand contributing factors to reading satisfaction and perceptions of modern electronic devices as reading aids . Present Studies Using an exploratory approach , the present research will use qualitative and quantitative methods to examine reading satisfaction and LVA use in a series of three studies . 38 Study 1 : Electronic Text Presentations for Reading with Low Vision . This study aimed to attain first impressions of reading with a tablet , and to discern whether alternative text presentations and tablet devices offer any benefit to readers with low vision compared to normally sighted readers . Five alternative text presentations were tested . Study 2 : Prolonged Use of Electronic Text Presentations for Reading with Low Vision . This study determined how prolonged exposure to reading with a tablet and with alternative formats affected satisfaction with reading over time , especially compared to their typical reading format . We also aimed to understand any strategies that develop to adapt to reading techniques with which participants’ may not be familiar . Study 3 : Low Vision Reading Aids : Awareness , Usage and Satisfaction . This study examined clinic and patient perspectives of low vision reading devices including tablets and e - readers . Two versions of a survey were distributed to low vision patients in a variety of clinics to determine exposure to various devices for reading , training received with devices , and ultimate satisfaction and use of reading devices following an initial vision consultation . This survey also examined patient perceptions of tablets as low vision reading aids . A separate survey was distributed to low vision rehabilitation professionals to understand the frequency of recommending various devices for reading and why tablets and e - readers may not be recommended at participating clinics . 39 CHAPTER 2 STUDY 1 : ELECTRONIC TEXT PRESENTATIONS FOR READING WITH LOW VISION Purpose Given the prior lack of emphasis on attitudinal aspects of the low vision reading experience , the purpose of Study 1 was to emphasize measures of preference and satisfaction in evaluating five text presentation methods on a tablet . While each of these methods have been tested independently , they had not yet been compared in the same study . By comparing a variety of potential reading strategies , we hoped to better understand the elements of reading satisfaction for individuals with low vision . With a combination of quantitative and qualitative information , our goal was to move toward promoting a better reading experience for those with low vision . By understanding reading satisfaction and comparing alternative reading methods , we may be able to better equip those who would otherwise give up reading entirely . Considering the encouraging research on using modern digital devices as reading aids for visually impaired users , we hoped to understand whether reading on a tablet yielded higher satisfaction than participants’ typical reading devices for older adults with AMD . Due to advancements in technology and electronic devices , text can be read in virtually any format that suits the reader . Tablets therefore appeared to be a suitable device regardless of which presentation type participants’ preferr ed . This study served to ascertain normal and low vision patients’ first impressions of reading with a tablet device using a variety of text presentation formats . Our specific research questions were : 40 1 ) How does reading on a tablet compare to participant s’ current reading method in terms of satisfaction with reading ? 2 ) Do low vision readers benefit from alternative text presentations in terms of satisfaction with reading ? 3 ) What factors contribute to satisfaction and preference between reading methods ? 41 Method Participants . We recruited 10 typically sighted ( TS ) participants via email using a subscription database provided by Wichita State University . All participants met the following inclusion criteria : age 50 or older ( Range = 59 - 80 , M = 68 . 30 , SD = 7 . 33 ) , native English speaker , and no history of ocular disease with the exception of removed cataracts . Nine low vision ( LV ) participants were recruited via referrals from Envision Research Institute in Wichita , Kansas . LV patients met the same age ( Range = 59 - 101 , M = 73 . 89 , SD = 12 . 56 ) and language criteria as the TS group , but were diagnosed with a visual impairment . Participants had no prior experience using any of the alternative reading strategies as a regular reading method . All participants received $ 30 for taking part in the study . Text presentation . A 10 . 1” Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 was used for text presentation . Android applications were developed to display each individual method using Java and the Android SDK . This tablet was chosen because of its screen size and inclusion of a flexible kickstand that allows the tablet to be rested on a surface . Black text was displayed in Roboto typeface in the center of a white background . Reading was completed in landscape orientation on the tablet . Each app opened to a blank display with an ‘X’ in the center ( Figure 10 ) . The first passage was displayed when the reader tapped on the ‘X’ . A toggle control was included so that nothing but the passage text was displayed during testing . In this mode , control settings were not visible . A vibration and dialog box ( Figure 11 ) at the end of each passage prompted the experimenter to continue to the next passage using the same format , or close the current app . A traditional Page presentation was compared to four alternative techniques : Scroll , RSVP , Modified RSVP , and ESP . 42 Page . The page format ( Figure 12 ) was intended as a baseline for traditional multi - line reading , akin to text displayed on an e - reader . Readers could navigate pages by tapping on the right half of the screen to move forward , and the left half of the screen to move backward . Participants read at a pace they deemed comfortable . RSVP . RSVP text was displayed as individual words at the center of the screen advancing at a constant pace ( Figure 13 ) . Modified RSVP . Modified RSVP also displayed individual words ( Figure 13 ) , but used the adjusted pacing determined by Aquilante et al . ( 2001 ) . Using this technique , the duration each word is presented is proportionate to the word’s length . This way , readers have more time with longer words and less time with shorter words . ESP . ESP presented words individually ( Figure 13 ) , but advancing each word required a tap on the screen . Tapping anywhere in the right half of the screen advanced the passage to the next word , and tapping the left half of the screen displayed the previous word . Using this method , participants were in full control of the pacing and time spent on each word . Scroll . Scrolling text moved automatically in a single line from the right center of the screen to the left at a steady pace ( Figure 14 ) . Figure 9 . Initial screen before a passage begins . Figure 10 . Dialog box following each passage . 43 Reading material . Fifteen text passages and comprehension questions were adapted from 501 Comprehension Questions ( Learning Express , LLC , 2006 ) and modified to be 150 - 200 words in length ( M = 174 . 90 , SD = 21 . 12 ) and under a 12 th grade reading level ( M = 10 . 62 , SD = 0 . 61 ) according to the Flesch - Kinkaid Grade Level Formula ( Flesch , 1994 ) . The order of experimental passages was counterbalanced , while practice passages were constant for each participant . Measures . Clinical features . The MNRead Acuity Chart was used at 40 cm viewing distance to measure reading acuity , maximum reading speed , and critical print size . These data can be found in Appendix A . Reading behavior and attitudes . Participants completed a questionnaire prior to participating in the study that assessed reading frequency , enjoyment , reading methods used , and typical reading method . Figure 13 . Scroll format . Figure 11 . Page format . Figure 12 . RSVP , Modified RSVP , and ESP format . 44 Text size and reading speed . Participants were given the ability to adjust text size and speed to their comfort during a practice passage when starting each reading method . The preferred size and speed were used for the entirety of the experimental passage that followed the practice . Initial text size was set to 32 pt font . Scroll speed began at 160 WPM , while RSVP and Modified RSVP began at 250 WPM . Reading speed was recorded on a text file saved to the tablet . Comprehension . Broad comprehension questions were included only to ensure participants understood the main idea of passage content , and not to thoroughly test their knowledge of what they read . Participants answered one multiple - choice question after each passage on a laptop using Qualtrics . Example questions include : “Which statement best describes the main idea of the passage ? ” and “What would be an appropriate title for this passage ? ” Answers were single - choice with four options . Reading satisfaction . A satisfaction questionnaire by Chaparro , Shaikh , and Baker ( 2005 ) was modified to suit the purpose of this study . Elements of the reading experience were rated using Likert - type items and responses were collected via Google Forms . Sample items included : level of comfort using this method to read , intent to continue reading with this presentation , and satisfaction compared to their current method . The full questionnaire can be found in Appendix A . Overall preference . At the conclusion of the study , participants were asked to rank each of the five methods in terms of preference . A short interview probed on the rationale for their rankings and how LV participants’ visual condition impacts the ir experience reading with different methods . 45 Procedure . Informed consent and an initial demographic questionnaire were obtained . Clinical features were measured using the MNRead acuity chart . The study procedure was explained and participants were given a choice to hold the tablet or rest it on a table using the kickstand . One practice passage was performed at the beginning of each reading method to allow participants to get accustomed to the method and set a comfortable speed . Once settings were determined , the practice passage was restarted . Participants also completed the comprehension question associated with the practice passage . Data from practice trials were not included in analysis . For the first six ( five TS and one LV ) participants , experimental trials consisted of two passages . This procedure was then modified to ensure participants did not spend longer than 90 minutes total in the study session . The second experimental trial for these six participants was excluded from analysis . The procedure thereafter consisted of one experimental passage after the practice trial using each presentation type , for a total of ten passages . Participants answered one comprehension question following each passage . When necessary , the experimenter read questions aloud to low vision participants . Each participant read passages using all five methods and order effects were reduced using partial counterbalancing as suggested by Goodwin and Goodwin ( 2013 ) . Using Matlab ( MathWorks , 2015 ) , all possible sequences ( 120 for five conditions ) were generated , shuffled , and randomly assigned to participants . However , due to technical difficulties with the apps , three participants had to use a different method than the one assigned that week . On these occasions , participants instead read with the presentation they were supposed to use the following week . 46 Though viewing distance was not held constant between participants for this study , viewing distance was measured and maintained during each presentation type . The satisfaction questionnaire was administered after each presentation type . After completing all reading methods , participants were interviewed about their preferences and experience with each method , and their comfort using a tablet to read . Results Background . Reading behavior . Six out of nine LV participants reported reading for pleasure daily , compared with eight of 10 TS . One LV patient reported never reading . The most common reading method used for LV was a magnifier with physical printed material such as books and newspaper ( 6 / 9 participants ) . For TS , the most common reading content was also printed material ( 7 / 10 ) . Reading attitudes . Measures of reading enjoyment and experience were assessed on a 7 - scale with 1 indicating the most negative response . TS participants rated general enjoyment of reading positively ( Median = 6 . 50 ) , while LV rated it negatively ( Median = 2 ) . All LV participants indicated that their reduced vision had impacted their reading ability for fewer than five years . Six of the nine LV reported that their ability to read for pleasure had been considerably impacted by their vision loss . Satisfaction with their current reading method was often low ( Median = 2 ) . Performance . Statistical analyses were carried out using R ( R Core Team , 2013 ) . Reading speed . A 2 × 5 mixed - model ANOVA was conducted to assess the effects of vision type ( LV or TS ) and text presentation type on reading speed . Results showed a significant main effect for vision type , in which LV readers ( M = 87 . 63 , SD = 40 . 62 ) read more slowly than TS ( M = 172 . 09 , SD = 77 . 70 ) , F ( 1 , 81 ) = 35 . 27 , p < . 001 , 𝜂 𝑝2 = 0 . 32 . We also 47 found a significant main effect for presentation type , F ( 4 , 81 ) = 3 . 73 , p < . 001 , 𝜂 𝑝2 = 0 . 17 . Tukey’s HSD revealed that Page ( M = 188 . 49 , SD = 94 . 08 ) was read significantly faster than all other presentations : ESP ( M = 111 . 83 , SD = 64 . 52 ) , RSVP ( M = 127 . 07 , SD = 71 . 77 ) , Scroll ( M = 96 . 29 , SD = 47 . 48 ) , and Modified RSVP ( M = 134 . 28 , SD = 68 . 15 ) . The vision type × presentation type interaction was not significant , F ( 4 , 81 ) = 2 . 08 , p > . 05 . See Figure 15 . Figure 15 . Reading speed . Page was read significantly faster than the alternative presentations by both LV and TS participants . Error bars represent standard error of the mean . TS = typically sighted ; LV = low vision . Reading comprehension . A 2 × 5 mixed - model ANOVA was conducted to assess the effect of vision type and presentation type on comprehension scores . No significant main effect was found for vision type , F ( 1 , 123 ) = 1 . 69 , p = . 196 or presentation type , F ( 4 , 123 ) = 0 . 22 , p = . 928 . The interaction between vision type and presentation type was also not significant , F ( 1 , 123 ) = 1 . 58 . p = . 184 , See Figure 16 . 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 ESP Page RSVP Scroll ModifiedRSVP S p ee d ( W P M ) Presentation Type Reading Speed TS LV 48 Figure 16 . Reading comprehension . TS participants scored higher in comprehension than LV on all presentation types except Modified RSVP , but no differences between vision or presentation types were statistically significant . Error bars represent standard error of the mean . TS = typically sighted ; LV = low vision . Subjective measures . Participants were asked to rate various items related to reading satisfaction and overall preference . Reading satisfaction . Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney tests were carried out to explore differences in reading satisfaction between LV and TS readers . Participants rated each presentation type with respect to overall satisfaction compared to their current reading method on a 5 - point scale , with scale items consisting of 1 ( significantly worse ) , 2 ( slightly worse ) , 3 ( no different ) , 4 ( slightly better ) , and 5 ( significantly better ) . LV participants reported higher satisfaction than TS with Scroll ( Z = 2 . 03 , p = . 042 , r = 0 . 47 ) , Modified RSVP ( Z = 2 . 14 , p = . 031 , r = 0 . 49 ) , and Page ( Z = 2 . 76 , p = . 006 , r = 0 . 63 ) , but these differences were not significant after a Bonferroni correction . No significant differences were found between LV and TS in ratings for RSVP ( Z = 1 . 30 , p = . 217 ) or ESP ( Z = 1 . 97 , p = . 057 ) .

LV participants were more satisfied than TS when comparing Modified RSVP to their current reading method . Median ratings indicated Modified RSVP was rated slightly better than their current method . TS = typically sighted ; LV = low vision . LV participants also indicated higher interest than TS in reading long passages of text with Scroll ( Z = 2 . 07 , p = . 039 , r = 0 . 48 ) , and more interest in reading short texts with RSVP than TS ( Z = 2 . 36 , p = . 019 , r = 0 . 54 ) . A comprehensive table of median ratings for all elements measured in this study can be found in Appendix B . Overall preference . Both LV and TS participants ranked the presentation types in a similar order . From high rank to low rank , overall preference was generally : Page ( 84 % of all participants ranked Page first : 90 % of TS , 78 % of LV ) , Scroll ( 63 % overall : 70 % of TS , 56 % of LV ) , Modified RSVP ( 42 % overall : 30 % of TS , 56 % of LV ) , RSVP ( 63 % overall : 50 % of TS , 78 % of LV ) , ESP ( 58 % overall : 40 % of TS , 78 % of LV ) . A full report of the rankings can be found in Appendix C . To more accurately represent preference between groups , the ranking scale was reversed , ratings were added for each presentation within the TS and LV groups , and percentages were computed based on the total possible score ( 50 for TS , 45 for 51 LV ) . Results were generally similar between LV and TS , with the exception that TS ranked ESP more highly than did the LV group . These results are shown in Figure 20 . Figure 20 . Preference ranking scores . TS and LV participants ranked all presentations but ESP similarly . TS = typically sighted ; LV = low vision . Qualitative data . Following the study , participants were asked about the rationale for their overall preference ranking , and about their opinions reading with a tablet . Preference rankings . Page was the consistent first ranking for both LV and TS readers . Generally , they had similar reasons for their decision : Page retained the most “natural” form of reading that was familiar and easy . Reading in a multi - line static format allowed participants to control the pace of their reading , use parafoveal information to predict upcoming text , and easily go back to re - read for clarification and comprehension . Though ranked lower than Page , there was benefit to the dynamic presentations . Both LV and TS readers commented that an automatic text presentation could add convenience to an electronic format by reducing the physical demand of tapping a screen to advance pages and words . The two LV participants that chose Scroll as their top preference 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % Page Scroll ModifiedRSVP RSVP ESP R a n k i n g S c o r e Presentation Type Preference Ranking Scores TS LV 52 reported an easier experience navigating text compared to a Page format . Scroll seemed to be favorable to those that had particular difficulty with navigating lines of text in a traditional format . Scrolling in one line reduced the need to make regressive sweeps from one line to the next – a common difficulty for people with AMD , and retained some sense of natural reading since words didn’t immediately disappear after they were read . Readers could still take advantage of information in the periphery while reading and make short regressions to re - read if necessary . For TS participants , Scroll was often their second preference due to its likeness to a traditional paragraph method , a retained sense of “natural flow , ” and similarity to a familiar “news ticker” format . The difference in cadence between RSVP and Modified RSVP largely went unnoticed by both LV and TS readers . Rationale for low rankings of ESP in the LV group was typically due to the physical strain of tapping to advance each word . Rather than providing a benefit of manually controlling speed as predicted , LV participants perceived the tapping as a hassle . In contrast , TS readers appreciated having more control over the duration words were presented compared to the automatic formats . Tablet reading . The primary benefits the tablet provided included the kickstand , flexibility of settings ( text size and speed ) , and creating a hands - free reading experience . Mounting the tablet with a kickstand and using highly magnified electronic text negated the need to use one hand to hold and navigate a magnifier across a page . This advantage also reduced the physical demand of holding a magnifier over reading material for an extended period of time . Six of the nine LV readers reported that using the tablet would encourage them to read more frequently due to the added conveniences mentioned above , as well as the portability offered by a tablet . 53 Discussion Implications . Most people in the LV group continued to read daily despite reporting low satisfaction with their current reading method . Behavioral ( reading frequency ) and attitudinal ( desire to read ) data reinforce the need to focus on reading techniques in low vision . Attitudes about current reading methods suggest a lack of effective , satisfactory reading solutions for this population . Performance . With respect to reading speed , participants likely benefitted from their familiarity with the Page format and its flexibility for allowing readers to progress at their own pace . Although the average reading speed for people with normal vision is approximately 250 words per minute ( De Leeuw & De Leeuw , 1965 ) , TS participants in our study often selected speeds below 200 words per minute for the alternative methods . Our speculation is that participants set slower speeds to compensate for the novelty and assumed worse performance afforded by methods like RSVP and Scroll . This contradicts previous findings on speed and performance of RSVP by Gannon et al . ( 2016 ) , wherein TS readers reported worse perceived comprehension with RSVP compared to Page . Measures of speed and comprehension showed participants read more quickly with RSVP with no significant difference in comprehension scores . Reading satisfaction . Taken together , the qualitative data and the satisfaction ratings collected in this study provide evidence that LV and TS participants generally preferred the same reading methods for similar reasons . An important distinction that can be made from our data is that alternative methods appear to provide more value for the LV group compared to TS . TS readers reported little value using the alternative formats . When vision loss progresses to the degree observed in the LV participants , however , the 54 advantages of reduced eye movements and hands - free reading become apparent . These results support the idea that alternative reading methods may be worth considering for individuals with vision loss who want to continue reading for pleasure . Page , Scroll , and Modified RSVP elicited higher satisfaction ratings than LV patients’ typical reading methods . Further , LV readers responded positively to using a tablet to read . The dissatisfaction we observed toward their typical reading method was a concerning finding , and more emphasis is placed on satisfaction with reading devices in Studies 2 and 3 of this project . An interesting comparison can be made between LV and TS satisfaction of the Page format . While TS typically rated Page as no different from their typical method , LV reported it as slightly better on average . This discrepancy could be due to a positive assessment of reading on a tablet compared to their current low vision reading device . Most participants in the LV sample reported using physical reading materials ( e . g . , newspapers , magazine articles ) as opposed to electronic . Together with our qualitative findings , their more positive ratings of the electronic methods could represent the advantages proposed in recent literature ( e . g . , magnified text , adjustable contrast , portability ) afforded by the tablet . Limitations and future research . Common limitations of conducting research with a low vision population are small sample sizes and highly variable data . The LV participants in this study had a variety of diagnoses and clinical features that made reading uniquely difficult for each person . In part , this variation could explain the higher variability observed in the distributions of scores and ratings for the LV group . It’s possible that variations in visual characteristics could play a role in preference for different reading methods . For 55 example , RSVP may be the method of choice only for patients who require high magnification and have difficulty navigating multiple lines of text . Future studies could examine the relationship between reading method preference / performance and specific clinical features . Our small sample made it difficult to achieve meaningful statistical results . For example , median satisfa ction ratings for the item “Interest in continuing to read with this presentation” showed considerable differences between groups , but these differences were not statistically significant . Future studies with larger samples and more uniformity may obtain significant results . A few methodological limitations should be addressed . A primary objective of this research was to preserve external validity . No chin rest was used during reading procedures to allow participants to maintain a comfortable position and read as they typically would . Allowing reading distances and angles to differ , however , limits the internal validity and uniformity of our data set . We believe this to be a minor compromise given the little variation observed between participants’ reading distances . It is also unlikely that any differences in viewing distance would impact our measuring reading satisfaction , which was the key objective of Study 1 . The counterbalancing procedure used in this study also did not completely control for order effects . Future studies should consider using an approach that control for both the conditions and materials used , such as the method proposed by Zeelenberg and Pecher ( 2015 ) . Participants also rarely used the pause and reverse features included in the reading applications . This was a surprise given the importance of regressive eye movements and personalized pace associated with comfortable , natural reading . Outside a lab setting , 56 participants may have been more inclined to explore and use these features , especially after gaining more experience with the tablet and each presentation . Study 2 applied an approach to try and alleviate this limitation . 57 CHAPTER 3 STUDY 2 : PROLONGED USE OF ELECTRONIC TEXT PRESENTATIONS FOR READING WITH LOW VISION Purpose Three of the five text presentation formats emerged as worthy of examining further with a low vision sample in Study 1 : page , scroll , and modified RSVP . In particular , there was a need for more qualitative work in understanding elements of reading satisfaction , especially in comparison with their typical reading method . Because Study 1 was an assessment of the first impression with these formats of reading , Study 2 aimed to explore reading satisfaction using the three most promising formats over time . To date , no study has examined the sustained use of tablets as a reading method for the visually impaired , nor have they investigated the use of alternative text presentations over time . Instead , studies of satisfaction with tablets and alternative text presentations have been done in short - term lab settings . Given the novelty of reading with presentations such as scroll and modified RSVP , it is important to note that initial impressions may reflect a lack of familiarity with the text format , or with using the tablet itself . To gain a more complete understanding of low vision readers’ impressions of these reading strategies , a diary experimental design was implemented to gather feedback through the course of one week using each presentation type . By allowing the participants to use a tablet daily in their own home and read their own preferred material , this study aimed to achieve a high level of external validity in detailing how satisfaction with reading may develop and change with experience . 58 Using the information learned from Study 2 , we were able to better understand satisfaction with electronic reading formats , especially compared to participants’ typical methods of reading . With this applied design , we learned how satisfaction changes over time with an electronic reading method and with using alternative text presentations . While Study 2 was considered another exploratory step in understanding complex issues related to reading habits and preferences , we believe the data gained can contribute to insights on how to optimize the experience of reading for visually impaired users . Our specific research questions were : 1 ) Will prolonged use of a tablet and alternative text presentations affect attitudes toward reading with those methods over time ? There is some evidence to suggest that experience with RSVP improves reading performance with that method ( Aquilante , 1999 ) . To our knowledge there is no comparable study investigating reading satisfaction with alternative formats over time , but research on general user satisfaction suggests exposure improves subjective outcomes for products over time ( Borsci , Federici , Bacci , Gnaldi , & Bartolucci , 2015 ) . Our expectation is that gaining familiarity with the formats will lead to greater satisfaction . 2 ) In terms of typical reading behaviors and satisfaction , how will using the tablet and the various text presentations compare to participants’ current reading method ? Based on Study 1 , we expect participants to report higher satisfaction for the tablet methods compared to their current reading method . Likewise , we anticipate page will be the most favored of the three methods tested . However , 59 since these methods have not been tested together over time with this population , these expectations are speculative . 3 ) What factors contribute to satisfaction and preference between reading methods ? Based on Study 1 , we expect most participants to prefer page due to familiarity and likeness to “natural” reading . 4 ) Will participants develop any strategies or adaptive behaviors to adjust to the new reading methods ? We expect participants may develop ways to adjust to the new methods over time , as evidenced by research on device use for people with disabilities ( Kane , Jayant , Wobbrock , & Ladner , 2009 ) . Because Study 1 only assessed first impressions with each method , we are uncertain which specific strategies or adaptations could emerge . Method Participants . Nine participants ( 6 female , 3 male ) with low vision were recruited through referrals from Envision Research Institute in Wichita , Kansas . Participants were over age 50 ( M = 66 . 44 , SD = 8 . 80 , Range = 24 ) , fluent English speakers , and had a diagnosed visual impairment . Participant information can be found in Appendix E . Assessment materials . Reading acuity , maximum reading speed , and critical print size were measured using the MNRead Acuity Chart at 40 cm viewing distance . Vision information was collected using the California Central Visual Field Test ( CCVF ) and Lea Hyvarinen contrast sensitivity chart . Questionnaires were completed using Google Forms . Text was read using a 10 . 1” Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 tablet . 60 Stimuli . Black text was displayed on a white background in landscape orientation on a tablet . The typeface was Roboto . A single Android application was created using Java and the Android SDK . All participants experienced all three text presentation formats : page , scroll , and modified RSVP . The presentation and functionality of these formats were the same as in Study 1 with the exception of scroll . Due to limitations of the application , scrolling text was split into sections of 2 - 3 paragraphs . At the end of these sections , the text would automatically pause and require readers to tap the text to advance to the next section . Upon launching the app , an initial screen was displayed wit h an ‘X’ in the center ( Figure 21 ) , which would disappear when tapped to display the text material . Reading materials . Participants selected books of interest to them prior to beginning the study . For each book requested , ePub files were found online , downloaded onto the tablet , and formatted for the app . Before the study began , participants gave researchers an idea of 2 - 5 books they were interested in reading . Researchers prepared ePub files for each book . If participants finished a book during the course of the study , their next preferred book was downloaded onto the tablet at the following meeting . Measures . Data were collected on demographics , reading behavior and attitudes prior to the study , and reading satisfaction and behavior throughout the study . Demographics . A demographic questionnaire collected information on age , gender , native language , and education . Participants were also asked about any previous experience using the text presentations examined in this study . Figure 20 . Initial screen upon launching the application . 61 Current reading behavior and attitudes . As part of an initial questionnaire , participants answered questions regarding : • How often they read for pleasure ( before and after their vision declined ) • The impact of their visual impairment on their reading frequency • How much they enjoy reading for pleasure ( before and after their vision declined ) • How long their reduced vision has impacted their reading • Their typical method of reading ( i . e . , devices used , typical environment ) • Their experience with rehabilitation for reading • The extent of their experience using electronic devices to read • Their comfort using a tablet to read This questionnaire can be found in Appendix D . Reading satisfaction and behaviors . Upon reading with each presentation type , subjective elements of the reading experience were assessed including : • Level of enjoyment • Likelihood of using that presentation type long term • Satisfaction compared to their current reading method Participants were asked to report on these factors before and after their week with each text presentation . Overall preference rankings between presentations were obtained at the conclusion of the study . Semi - structured interviews were conducted to gain qualitative data pertaining to their experience and satisfaction with each method , as well as information about their use of tablet features , reading duration , and reading with methods other than the tablet . Interviews we re audio recorded with participants’ permission . 62 Procedure . The diary design was arranged into a total of four in - person meetings with each participant over the course of three weeks , and two interviews by phone each week . Each participant experienced each format for one week . The order of formats was counterbalanced using the same method as Study 1 . Table 1 outlines the study timeline and procedures . Questionnaires for Study 2 can be found in Appendix D through Appendix I . Meeting 1 . Informed consent , demographic information , reading attitudes and behaviors , and MNRead data were collected . The study design was explained and participants were given instructions on the basic operations of the tablet and the app . The first reading method was described , and the participant read with that method silently for approximately five minutes . During this time , text size and speed ( when applicable ) were set to comfortable levels as determined by the participant . To gain information about their first impression , a reading satisfaction questionnaire was administered orally , along with a semi - structured interview to gain more detail about their initial thoughts . Items assessed initially include 7 - point Likert items for overall enjoyment reading with that format , likelihood of using that format for reading long term , and perceived eyestrain . Participants were also asked the same question as in Study 1 regarding how reading with each text presentation compares to their current reading method . Qualitatively , participants described initial likes and dislikes of each presentation . Participants were given the tablet to take home for the week and were asked to read for at least 15 minutes per day using the tablet . Participants were also given an instruction sheet about the tablet and daily log packets to record any notes as they read . Meeting 2 . An end - of - week satisfaction questionnaire was administered to participants about the format they had just completed . The questionnaire asked the same 63 questions as the first impression , with the addition of : a question about whether using that format to read would encourage participants to read less , the same amount , or more than they do currently ; and 7 - point Likert items of perceived comprehension and speed of reading . Participants were then introduced to the next presentation type , and completed the first impression questionnaire after briefly reading with the new method . Meeting 3 . The third meeting followed the same procedure as the second . Meeting 4 . The final meeting consisted of the end of week satisfaction questionnaire for the last format and a final interview that reflected on all three weeks . The final interview included questions about how each presentation compares to their current method of reading , a rating of comfort using a tablet to read , a ranking of the three tested formats in terms of reading satisfaction , and suggestions for improving the application and tablet device . Phone interviews . Two brief phone interviews were conducted throughout each week , usually two days apart . Information collected during these calls included estimated time spent reading on the tablet , likes and dislikes about the presentation format , the reading scenario ( i . e . , environment , lighting used ) use of tablet features such as changing text size or speed , and any strategies or changes that came up as they adjusted to reading on the tablet . Participants were also asked if they read for leisure using any other method in addition to the tablet , and their reading duration with that method . These data were also collected at the in - person meeting at the end of each week to ensure that these data were accounted for over the entire week . 64 Table 1 Study Timeline Note .

Because this study was exploratory , qualitative data collected in Study 2 was subjected to inductive thematic analysis using the process outlined by Braun and Clarke ( 2006 ) . This method was selected due to its flexibility and its independence from any specific theoretical position . Data analysis was performed using the Reframer tool from Optimal Workshop ( Optimal Workshop , 2018 ) . Two researchers took part in coding and both were aware of the research goals and the process ( Braun & Clarke , 2006 ) prior to beginning analysis . A detailed description of the analysis process can be found in Appendix J . Data analysis resulted in 40 unique codes . These codes were categorized into four broad themes : Performance , Enjoyment , Flexible Features , and Personal Factors . Figure 22 shows the breakdown of themes and sub - themes . Performance referred to functional , objectively measurable aspects of reading . This theme included codes like Accuracy ( concern for encoding words , navigating text correctly and reducing reading errors ) , Comprehension ( understanding and focusing on the reading material ) , and Speed ( specific references to how fast or slow they can read , or how much time it takes to read ) . A comprehensive list of codes can be found in Appendix K . Enjoyment referred to factors associated with the pleasure of reading . Enjoyment consisted of two sub - themes : Immersion ( involvement and interest in reading content ) and Ease ( simplicity or lack of effort associated with a reading method or device ) . A central feature of Immersion seemed to be a likeness to what participants considered “natural” reading , or reading as a typically sighted person would read a book . Participants often referenced “natural” reading in terms of the pace of the reading , navigating the page or 66 book . Ease was characterized in part by the physical demands of the device , wherein participants commented on the ease of holding and maneuvering the tablet compared to other devices they used . The physical demands piece was largely tied to the device features theme . Flexible Features referred to both physical and nonphysical elements of the method or device . The central element of this theme was about flexibility afforded to the users of the device , and the ability to customize to their needs and preferences . Flexible Features included three sub - themes : Convenience , Device Features , and App Features . Although there was overlap between Enjoyment / Ease and Convenience , Convenience was determined to relate to Flexible Features because it encompassed mentions of freedom in where and how the device is used ( e . g . , portability allowed users to read outside the home ) . Device Features refers to elements inherent to the device such as the screen size and kickstand . App Features describes thoughts related to app functionality , flexibility in changing text elements / preference , or settings such as contrast and brightness . Two other sub - themes also emerged as personal factors that contribute to a satisfactory reading experience : Determination and Awareness . Determination refers to attitudes of perseverance and motivation to continue reading despite difficulty imposed by vision loss . For some , this manifested in a resistance toward switching from visual reading to audio books , which has also been suggested in previous qualitative research ( Burton , 2013 ; Horowitz et al . , 2006 ) . Awareness described the degree to which participants were knowledgeable about reading techniques and devices available for low vision reading . 67 Figure 21 . Breakdown of themes from Study 2 qualitative analysis . 68 Examples of data corresponding with each theme or sub - theme can be found below : • Performance – Accuracy : “With a w hole paragraph sometimes it ' s hard to focus on the specific line , but with scroll I don ' t get confused with where I am . ” – P3 • Performance – Comprehension : I hate reading [ with modified RSVP ] . It ' s just so disjointed and after reading it for a while yesterday it ' s just so difficult to comprehend what you ' re reading . So I lose interest because of the method because you can ' t comprehend as well . It ' s a very discouraging part of the app . I ' ve read less because of it . It ' s like a task now , something I have to do and don ' t enjoy . – P8 • Performance – Speed : “ I can read faster with the tablet . I ' m used to it now and I could progressively read faster . ” – P3 • Enjoyment – Immersion : [ The scroll method ] ke eps you interested in the story . It’s easier to read because [ modified RSVP ] didn ' t really connect - by the time I got that one word I ' m wondering how it relates to what came before . [ Scroll ] …is better than the magnifier because it ' s more like reading how I read before I was visually impaired . – P4 • Enjoyment – Ease : It’s c ertainly still easier than desktop - trying to lean over a keyboard and magnify an area on the screen – it’s not portab le , can’t bring it up closer . 69 With this you can bring it up closer easily , just makes it far easier and of course , the resolution is still a major component . – P6 • Flexible Features – Convenience : The portability has been really nice . I made a special point to move around and be in a different room when I did my reading yesterday just because you can so why not give it a try in a new position ? … The thing is I had my granddaughter here last night . . . and I wasn’t closed off in my room [ using the computer to read ] . I could know what her activities were and I was able to sit back and read and she occupied herself while I did too . So I was able to be closer to her and not be shut off away from the rest of the world where I usually am when I do anything on the computer . So basically that’s a reading session that would not have happened without a portable device like that to access . – P6 • Flexible Features – Device features : “ I like that I can sit at my table with coffee and relax , or sit on the couch with it propped up resting on me . I always have to set my magnifier down . Tablets without stands are hard to hold . ” – P3 • Flexible Features – App features : “A t first it was too slow and was dragging , so I sped it up and that seemed to help . I made the font bigger too . ” – P3 • Determination : “I am a reader , so if I make up my mind I’ll get through it . And I made up my mind , by gum . I deci ded I’m not going to quit reading unless I go blind . ” – P4 70 • Awareness : “T his could just open up a new avenue for me . To some extent you limit yourself to what you ' re comfortable with until somebody helps expose you to the new things that are available . " – P6 After themes were identified , findings were consolidated into a model that describes how a satisfactory reading experience was obtained for these individuals with low vision . This model is visualized in Figure 23 . Findings were organized into three sets of categories that describe a process to achieving satisfactory reading : Personal factors , Device factors , and Reading outcomes . Personal factors include individual attitudes and characteristics that contribute to satisfaction . Device factors describe what can be achieved with a satisfactory device , leading to successful Reading outcomes . The two personal factors , Determination and Awareness , were established first . Participants were successful when they were intrinsically driven to keep reading , and had access to a reading strategy that met their needs . Attainment of personal factors sets a foundation for a device to be perceived as useful . A chief characteristic of a satisfactory device was flexible features . These features allow users to customize settings to their needs and preferences , leading to more accurate and efficient reading . Flexibility also allowed for a more immersive , easy reading experience by allowing readers to focus on the content and reduce distractions resulting from visual strain . Features like simple navigation through text ( app feature ) and the kickstand ( device feature ) made the device easy to use . The advantage of the tablet in this case was the ability to adjust the device to various circumstances ; participants reported enjoying the ease of changing the screen brightness , using the kickstand , and angling the 71 screen to suit the lighting or other environmental conditions in which they read . These benefits culminated in two primary outcomes for a satisfactory reading experience : reading performance and reading enjoyment . Reading performance seemed to be the result of accuracy ( properly encoding letters and words ) , comprehension ( understanding and retention of content ) , and reading at a comfortable pace that is fast enough to mitigate frustration induced by slow , effortful reading . When reading was perceived as too difficult , slow , or hard to comprehend , readers reported less engagement and satisfaction with their reading experience . Our analysis therefore holds that reading performance contributed to overall reading enjoyment . Satisfaction was highest when both reading performance and enjoyment were present . The model concludes that when patients felt the method afforded high performance and enjoyment , a satisfactory overall reading experience could be attained . 72 Figure 23 . Qualitative analysis of reading satisfaction . Low vision patients were first inherently determined to continue reading and aware of their options for assistive devices . Flexible device features allowed for greater accuracy , comprehension , speed , immersion , and ease of reading . These factors led to better reading performance and enjoyment . Together , these high - level reading requirements defined an effective device . An effective device then afforded a satisfactory reading experience . We can refer to elements of the general model in understanding perceptions of each of the three presentation types tested . Generally , participants preferred the page method due to its likeness to “natural” reading , and ability to allow readers to determine the pace and cadence of reading . Page also allowed more freedom for interruption in that participants were less concerned about taking their eyes away from the text and coming back to find their place compared to the dynamic methods . The familiarity of page and 73 novelty of the other two presentations also made it stronger in both the Performance and Enjoyment elements , leading to overall higher satisfaction . Detailed findings about the specific presentations are elaborated in the Discussion section when lending context to the quantitative results . Quantitative data . Data collected via closed - ended survey questions were analyzed using R ( R Core Team , 2013 ) . Items of particular interest are outlined in Table 2 . Due to the small sample size , ordinal scales , and violations of normality observed in the distributions , nonparametric tests were applied . Nonparametric tests are often practical in similar low vision reading ( Walker et al . , 2016 ) and human - computer interaction ( Wobbrock , Findlater , Gergle , & Higgins , 2011 ) research . Quantitative results are summarized in Appendix L . Table 2 Quantitative items most important to the research objectives . Questionnaire item Measured Scale Analysis How does this method compare to your typical method ?

Pre - week Post - week 7 - point 1 = Very unlikely 7 = Very likely Aligned Rank Transform Would this method encourage you to read… Post - week 3 - point 1 = Less often 2 = The same amount 3 = More often Friedman test 74 The Aligned Rank Transform ( ART ) procedure ( Wobbrock et al . , 2011 ) was used in R ( Kay & Wobbrock , 2016 ) to format the data as aligned ranks to examine the effect of time and presentation type on participant satisfaction ratings . In accordance with the ART procedure , a 2  3 repeated - measures ANOVA was then performed on the ranked scores . Unlike other non - parametric approaches , ART was selected due to its ability to handle multiple factors , repeated - measures designs , and interactions , as well as its intent for human - computer interaction research using small samples . This method allows us to transform data for use with standard parametric procedures . To understand how presentation type and time affect comparisons to their typical method , participants were asked to rate each method on a 5 - point scale at the beginning and end of each week ( see Table 2 ) . A main effect of presentation type was found , F ( 2 , 40 ) = 8 . 30 , p < . 001 , 𝜂 𝑝2 = 0 . 29 . Tukey ’s post hoc tests revealed that page ( Median = 4 . 0 , IQR = 3 – 5 ) was rated significantly higher than both modified RSVP ( Median = 1 . 5 , IQR = 1 – 4 ) and scroll ( Median = 3 . 5 , IQR = 2 . 5 – 5 ) . Medians indicate p age was generally rated as ‘slightly better’ than their current reading method , modified RSVP was rated between ‘slightly worse’ and Table 2 ( continued ) How would you rank each method in terms of preference for reading ? Post - study Rank order 1 = Best 3 = Worst Friedman test Level of comfort using a tablet to read Pre - study Post - study 7 - point 1 = Very uncomfortable 7 = Very comfortable Wilcoxon signed - rank test 75 ‘significantly worse’ than their typical method , and scroll was rated between ‘slightly better’ and ‘no different’ . There was no significant main effect for time , F ( 1 , 40 ) = 0 . 12 , p = . 773 , nor a significant interaction between presentation type and time , F ( 2 , 40 ) = 1 . 08 , p = . 350 ( see Figure 24 ) . Violin plots show box plots within mirrored kernel density estimates , depicting a smoothed histogram to detail the underlying distribution . The plots in Figure 24 show the degree of variability for all three presentations , with modified RSVP and scroll showing generally lower ratings than page . Interesting to note is the identical median time 1 rating for page and scroll . 76 Figure 24 . Ratings of satisfaction compared to typical reading method . Page was rated significantly higher than both modified RSVP and Scroll across both time 1 and time 2 . Violin plots show box plots within kernel density distributions . Enjoyment was measured on a 7 - point scale at the beginning and end of each week . A main effect of presentation type was found , F ( 2 , 40 ) = 26 . 12 , p < . 001 𝜂 𝑝 2 = 0 . 57 . Tukey ’s post hoc tests revealed that page ( Median = 7 . 0 , IQR = 7 – 7 ) was rated higher in enjoyment 77 than both modified RSVP ( Median = 4 , IQR = 1 – 6 ) and scroll ( Median = 5 . 0 , IQR = 4 . 25 – 6 ) . There was not a significant main effect for time , F ( 1 , 40 ) = 0 . 02 , p = . 882 , nor a significant interaction between presentation type and time , F ( 2 , 40 ) = 1 . 73 , p = . 190 ( see Figure 25 ) . Note the change in ratings from page time1 to time 2 , in which plots show some variation at time 1 compared to all ratings as 7 in time 2 . We can also see the change in distributions for modified RSVP shifting from largely negative scores to more positive . Distributions for scroll show a general shift toward lower enjoyment at time 2 , as well as less agreement between participants . 78 Figure 25 . Enjoyment ratings . Page was rated significantly higher than both modified RSVP and scroll across both time 1 and time 2 . We also asked participants to rate their likelihood to continue using each presentation type as a long term reading strategy at the beginning and end of each week . A main effect of presentation type was found , F ( 2 , 40 ) = 52 . 65 , p < . 001 , 𝜂 𝑝 2 = 0 . 72 . Tukey ’s post hoc tests revealed that page ( Median = 7 . 0 , IQR = 7 – 7 ) was rated higher than both 79 modified RSVP ( Median = 1 . 0 , IQR = 1 – 5 ) and scroll ( Median = 4 . 5 , IQR = 2 – 5 . 75 ) . There was not a significant main effect for time , F ( 1 , 40 ) = 0 . 02 , p = . 392 . A significant interaction between presentation type and time was also found , F ( 2 , 40 ) = 4 . 10 , p = . 024 , 𝜂 𝑝2 = 0 . 17 . Contrast tests were performed according to the method proposed by Kay ( 2016 ) to determine differences between comparisons . Because ART reports differences with main effects removed , contrast tests examined “differences of differences” ( Marascuilo & Levin , 1970 ) . For example , testing whether the difference between page and scroll at time 1 is significantly different from the difference between page and scroll at time 2 . Results showed that the difference between modified RSVP and scroll at time 1 differed significantly from the difference between modified RSVP and scroll at time 2 . This difference is evident when we examine the data visually ( Figure 26 ) , noting the change in slope between modified RSVP and scroll from time 1 to time 2 . 80 Figure 26 . Median ratings for intent to use presentation types as a long term method . Participants rated their likelihood to continue using each method at the beginning and end of the three - week study . A Friedman test was used to assess whether participants thought each method would encourage them to read less often , the same amount , or more often than they currently do . Results showed a significant effect , χ 2 ( 2 ) = 7 . 63 , p = . 022 . A Nemenyi test was used to explore where differences between presentation types may be . This test is 81 recommended as a nonparametric alternative to Tukey’s post hoc tests in cases where all conditions are compared to each other ( Demšar , 2006 ) . The Nemenyi test yielded nonsignificant results for all comparisons , which may be due to a lack of statistical power ( Demšar , 2006 ) . Median ratings for page and modified RSVP indicate these methods would encourage them to read more often , while the median scroll rating suggests participants would read the same amount as they do now ( see Figure 27 ) . Once again , page showed less variation in responses compared to modified RSVP and scroll . 82 Figure 27 . Level of encouragement to read more often , the same amount , or less often with each method . At the conclusion of the study , participants were asked to rank each method in terms of preference . A Friedman test found a significant effect , χ 2 ( 2 ) = 15 . 2 , p < . 001 . The Nemenyi test showed that page ( Median = 1 . 0 , IQR = 1 – 1 ) was ranked significantly higher than modified RSVP ( Median = 3 . 0 , IQR = 2 – 3 ) . No other comparisons were significant . 83 Rankings followed the same pattern as Study 1 , wherein Page was ranked as first ( best ) preference , Scroll second , and modified RSVP third . To represent these results , scores were calculated with the same reverse - scale method as Study 1 and are presented in Figure 28 . Figure 28 . Preference ranking scores . Rankings generally followed the order ( best to worst ) : Page , Scroll , modified RSVP . To understand whether using a tablet over a three - week period would improve ratings of comfort using a tablet to read , a Wilcoxon signed - rank test was performed . Results showed that ratings improved from the beginning ( Median = 5 . 0 , IQR = 4 – 6 ) to the end ( Median = 7 . 0 , IQR = 6 – 7 ) of the study , Z = 3 . 74 , p < . 001 , r = 1 . 25 ( see Figure 29 ) . 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % Page RSVP Scroll R a n k i n g S c o r e Presentation Type Preference Ranking Scores 84 Figure 29 . Comfort using a tablet to read . Comfort ratings improved from the beginning to the end of the three - week study . Individual profiles . To capture each participant’s experience , ind ividual profiles were created that depict unique perspectives . Profiles can be found in Appendix M . 85 Discussion Implications of the qualitative data . Data from the qualitative interviews show an overall picture of what we learned about participants’ perceptions of reading with a tablet using various presentation types for a three - week period . Insights were similar to those found in Study 1 , but findings from Study 2 aim for a more developed , refined presentation of reading satisfaction with low vision . Taken together , the interviews elicited general feedback about the reading experience altogether in addition to the individual presentation types . The resulting themes depict contributing features to a satisfactory reading experience in light of the tablet method . Interpretation of interview data can be summarized into the following key findings : Low vision patients may be unaware of the potential for tablets as a reading aid . Four of the nine participants were not aware of the capabilities of tablets for reading prior to the study . Despite this study being the first experience for some , participants seemed to prefer the tablet to their original method . An exception that should be noted is when participants were already using a tablet or e - reader as their primary leisure reading device ( two of nine ) . In these instances , evaluations compared minor differences in the specific features of the tablet hardware and reading apps compared to their own . Despite some having limited prior experience or knowledge about tablets , enthusiasm for reading with tablets was high . This was particularly true for participants who had the least experience with them prior to the study . For example , P4 ( a 72 - year - old female ) , had never used a computer or the internet . She still enjoyed reading despite having very low satisfaction with her handheld magnifier 86 because of how difficult it was to hold and navigate lines of text . She reported reading much more frequently and for longer periods of time with the tablet than she could her magnifier , and asked many questions about how to get a tablet for herself . She said of using the page format : The words ar e bigger and I’ve never skipped a line with this . So that’s a big advantage . And on the newspaper I have to go back to the beginning , start over , then there will be another sentence jump on me . I used to love it and read the paper every day , but I almost dropped it because it was taking me forever to read it . But I don’t want to ever get to the point where I can’t read because I get enjoyment out of it , it teaches me things that I don’t know . I know a lot of people that quit reading … s o as long as I’m not blind I never want to give it up . Envision showed me [ audio books ] , b ut I didn’t want to give up reading so bad I said no I don’t want to use that . If I got one of these tablets could I take it somewhere to get books ? . . . Wow , well thanks for telling me that . I didn’t know about any of this - I didn’t know you could do all this or how much they cost . I read quite a bit . P6 , a 56 - year - old male , was the only participant with juvenile macular degeneration . Since he had been without vision for much of his life , he had not read for pleasure since childhood . He reported that even before his visual impairment he didn’t consider himself an avid reader . When initially using the page format , he stated : Actually I’m considering maybe going and buying a tab let at this point… just because of its convenience just to supplement my desktop and all . I kind of like it , I find it difficult to say right now whether i t’s something that would be really long term , but 87 it’s certainly not something that is so difficult and ease of access is good enough that I can see myself doing it short term at least …if it’s convenient enough I think maybe I would . Just sitting right by the bedside or whatever , it seems like it would be pretty easy to stay with . Three weeks after the study , P6 contacted the researcher to follow up on his progress . He reported that he had since bought his own tablet , was reading e - books daily , and was grateful to be “re - introduced to the world of reading . ” A similar pattern emerged with P7 , a 75 - year - old male who was not a reader even before visual impairment . He said during a phone interview : This morning I was on it for an hour . I enjoy it . [ My wife ] said , ‘I’ve never seen you read so much since you were in college . ’ It’s just so much easier for me to read t his than anything else . I wish I had one personally . I have a Kindle I play games on . Maybe I should try reading books on that too . Emulating natural reading may help overcome barriers to novel methods . A consistent and strong indicator of satisfaction for our participants was likeness to familiar methods or “natural” reading cadence . The most common criticism of scroll and modified RSVP , for example , was that the dynamic text was too “robotic” or “unnatural . ” Readers reported having less control over the pace of the reading and navigating the page or book as they typically would . However , they often saw the benefit of reducing eye movements and the potential for error reduction in moving eyes between words and lines . The ability to pause text , move backwards , and adjust speed settings were redeeming features for the dynamic presentations , albeit still less preferable than page . 88 Flexibility is a key factor in an effective reading device . Participants reported that reading with the tablet allowed for more diversity in reading environments . Due to the portability afforded by the device , participants shared stories detailing how the tablet allowed them to read while on the go or without confining themselves to a specific location ( e . g . , where the desktop CCTV or their lamp is located ) . This allowed participants to feel less isolated and more flexible with their reading habits . The ability to increase text size and screen brightness also reduced the need for manually navigating text with a magnifier or using reading lamps . The finding that customizable features are an important attribute in a low vision reading device echo previous qualitative research ( Hallett et al . , 2015 ) . Enjoyment drives reading satisfaction . While this was not necessarily a surprising finding , worth mentioning is that enjoyment seems to be the key factor in satisfactory reading for people with low vision . Of course , performance is an important contributor to an enjoyable experience . A severe loss of accuracy or speed can be frustrating and diminish a person’s desire to read . Even so , participants in Study 2 were determined to continue reading despite their deteriorated performance compared to reading before their visual impairment . The desire to continue reading for pleasure appeared to mitigate a weakened performance for some participants . Two participants who ranked modified RSVP as their least preferred presentation type reported they would still use it if it were the only way they could continue reading . While performance is still an undeniably essential feature for effective reading , participants appeared more motivated by the level of enjoyment , immersion , and pleasure associated with reading . These findings reinforce the need to focus on patient preference in addition to performance when evaluating reading devices . 89 Strategies for adapting to each method manifested in experimenting with tablet features . As part of the phone interviews , participants were asked whether they had begun using any strategies to adapt to the text presentation they were using on the tablet . Two participants attempted angling the tablet in various positions to get a better view of text . All participants reported trying the kickstand for greater convenience and ease of use . For example , multiple participants reported propping the tablet up on the kickstand if they wanted to read lying down . The fact that participants were willing to manipulate settings and use the device to make reading more enjoyable and efficient is encouraging . In Study 1 , we observed very little in terms of changing text size , speed , or position of the device . This finding from Study 2 suggests that the observations in Study 1 could be due to the lab setting in which reading was performed . When patients are at home reading their own content , it appears they may be more likely to experiment with flexible options and custom settings . Alternative presentations may benefit a subset of low vision readers . While describing the reading experience as a whole , the qualitative data can also lend insight into our interpretation of the quantitative information focused on distinguishing the three presentation types . Interviews suggested higher satisfaction using page compared to scroll or modified RSVP . Considering the model of reading satisfaction ( Figure 23 ) and its thematic underpinnings ( Figure 22 ) we can offer an explanation for why page was the favored method . The most common problems associated with scroll and modified RSVP were losses in both reading performance – reduced accuracy ( e . g . , missed words ) , comprehension , and speed , and reading enjoyment – ease and immersion . Patients especially reported a lack of immersion as a result of the “unnatural” cadence produced by 90 the dynamic text . Page retained a sense of familiarity in a paragraph format that allowed readers more control over the pace and cadence of reading . The most common issue with page was difficulty navigating multiple lines of text . Modified RSVP was described as being “disjointed” and “robotic , ” similar to descriptions heard in Study 1 . However , a few participants noted during phone interviews that they were “getting used to” the method as the week progressed . Participants experimented to find the right speed and gain comfort with the pause and reverse features , which could contribute to the increased ratings we observed at the end of the week ( Figure 24 , Figure 25 , and Figure 26 ) . Several participants understood the benefit modified RSVP could provide to people with low vision who have difficulty with eye movements . Since the text position is fixed and words are presented automatically , eyes can remain focused on one area of the screen . One reported advantage of scroll was the single - line format . This alleviated the difficulty of regressive eye movements from one line to the next in the traditional page presentation . Participants also mentioned that scroll retain ed a sense of the natural “flow” of typical reading since surrounding words were still displayed . However , participants reported struggling with the motion of the text , calling it “distracting” and “busy . ” The motion also reportedly made text appear more blurred . It is also worth pointing out that five of the nine participants reported that using the tablet with modified RSVP or scroll would still encourage them to read more often than they currently do . This speaks to the possibility of alternative formats providing an advantage for people who have difficulty maneuvering cumbersome devices or who have 91 given up reading as a result of their visual condition . More research is needed to determine which patients would benefit most from which format . Implications of the quantitative data . The page presentation performed highest on all measures of satisfaction . This finding is consistent with Study 1 , and can likely be explained by the same factors described in the qualitative data from that study ; that is , page was a more familiar presentation and allowed readers more control over pacing and navigation of text . Scroll generally was evaluated higher than modified RSVP , though a higher sample size may be necessary to find significance in these differences . Worth noting is that ratings for scroll decreased from time 1 to time 2 on each measure , though differences were nonsignificant . One potential explanation for this pattern is a technical flaw in the app some participants experienced during their time reading with scroll . Programming difficulties with the scroll app sometimes caused text to appear jumbled or overlapping , or freeze on the screen . Despite efforts to keep evaluations focused on the presentation type , this issue could contribute to reduced satisfaction with the method after an initially positive impression . The effect of prolonged use of the scroll method should be assessed in future studies for a more accurate representation . Page also showed high ratings as a first impression that remained positive over the week of use . Another consistent finding is that median ratings for modified RSVP increased on each measure . Though these differences were not statistically significant , future studies with a larger sample may be able to demonstrate reliable improvement in satisfaction over time using modified RSVP as a leisure reading method . Interestingly , though specific modified RSVP ratings increased while scroll decreased , participants tended to place scroll above modified RSVP in the final preference ranking . It is important to notice that while the 92 change in ratings appears opposite for the two presentations , their ending points at time 2 ( the same time final preference rankings were obtained ) were typically similar . Given the qualitative information we learned about each method , we estimate that scroll was ultimately preferred due to the retention of some “natural” reading attributes , while modified RSVP was a more unfamiliar and uncomfortable presentation . Another pattern to note is that in terms of overall satisfaction , the presentation types tested were rated at least equal to their typical method . The median rating for page indicated ‘slightly better’ satisfaction . Median ratings also indicate that both pag e and modified RSVP would encourage participants to read more often than they do now . Page was consistently rated highly as a method patients would consider using as a long term reading strategy . These findings together suggest that using a tablet as a leisure reading method could be promising for people with low vision . Additionally , the pre and post ratings of tablet comfort demonstrate that comfort with the tablet method could improve in a number of weeks as users gain familiarity with the device . Although some patients may benefit from methods like modified RSVP and scroll , it appears these presentations are consistently less likely to provide a broad advantage compared to a traditional static text presentation . Limitations and future research . A few limitations to the study should be mentioned . Due to the applied nature of Study 2 and its aim for ecological validity , we had less control over the variables we measured . For example , data collected on the time participants spent reading with the tablet were restricted to self - report . We also could not directly observe patients reading with the tablet during the week , so our understanding of how they used the device , which settings they adjusted , and any technical issues were also 93 based solely on participant feedback . We believe the frequency with which we contacted participants in the study was sufficient to collect the information necessary to answer the research questions . Observing and training participants once per week also allowed us to correct any technical problems detected by the researcher or ask further questions about how they used the device while at home compared to in lab . Study 2 was affected by the same limitations as Study 1 with respect to a highly variable low vision sample . Our sample size for Study 2 was also small , and therefore statistical power was reduced and generalizability limited . Future studies should employ a larger sample of people with visual impairments to test for reliable differences in satisfaction with presentation types and using a tablet over time . Study 2 also employed four of the same participants as Study 1 , so it’s possible that a more diverse set of participants could suggest different findings . Of the nine participants in Study 2 , three used either a tablet or e - reader as their primary leisure reading device , and four used some form of digital reading material ( including desktop computers and mobile phones ) . It is unclear whether these participants’ utilization of digital formats , especially tablets and e - readers , is representative of the target population . We hope to learn more about prevalence of reading methods in Study 3 . In comparing data and outcomes from Study 1 and Study 2 , some key methodological differences warrant discussion . Study 1 was conducted in a lab setting with pre - selected reading material . Given the purpose of Study 2 as an applied exploration of tablet reading over time , we found considerable value in the diary methodology employed . Allowing participants to choose reading material and use the device independently for an extended period allowed for a more natural experience through which to compare the 94 presentation types . Because participants enjoyed the material they were reading , and often times the method they were reading with , we found that most participants read long past the requested 15 minutes per day using the tablet . We also gathered information on whether participants went back to their typical reading method at any point during the study . Returning to their current method was not typical unless participants had already been using a tablet for reading prior to the study , or if participants were not enjoying the presentation type they were assigned that week . Due to the ability to measure natural behavior over time , we recommend future research consider a diary method to evaluate novel reading devices compared to patients’ typical strategies . The difference in reading behavior in Study 1 compared to Study 2 further supports the need to assess low vision reading devices outside of a lab setting . We also stress the importance of allowing patients to select reading material in order to capture a better approximation of their potential use of the device . 95 CHAPTER 4 STUDY 3 : LOW VISION READING AIDS : AWARENESS , USAGE AND SATISFACTION Purpose Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that alternative text presentation formats like modified RSVP and scroll may be beneficial to some readers with low vision . They also suggested the broader benefit of tablets as low vision reading devices , despite possibly being under - utilized by patients ( Casten et al . , 2016 ) . Given the exploratory , qualitative nature of the methods used in Studies 1 and 2 , Study 3 acted in part as a way to generalize the findings from the small samples used previously . A large - scale survey was used to examine whether themes identified from the previous two studies apply to a larger sample of people with low vision . Particular themes of interest include a lack of satisfaction with current LVAs , superiority of the tablet in terms of the overall reading experience compared to the current LVA , and lack of awareness and training with tablets and e - readers as potential reading aids . Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of tablets as reading aids for low vision , yet these devices appear to be under - represented in low vision services . This could be due to a number of factors , including patient perceptions of tablets as reading aids and lack of awareness about available devices and resources . As a starting point to understand why this under - representation is occurring , Study 3 aimed to examine the link between low vision services and device selected for leisure reading after an initial eye care consultation . For our purposes , an initial consultation constitutes any appointment with an eye care or low vision professional in which patients are exposed to a variety of possible reading aids . 96 The literature examining use and satisfaction with LVAs has largely excluded modern electronic devices available without a prescription . To date , this will be the first study to describe prevalence and satisfaction with LVAs , including tablets and e - readers , for leisure reading in the United States . In addition to prevalence , the intent of Study 3 was to better understand device selection , satisfaction , and ultimate use or abandonment after one month . Specifically , this study should catalyze further exploration into why tablets may be underutilized as LVAs for reading , despite their demonstrated benefits . This study allowed us to identify initial barriers to adopting tablets as primary reading devices , and suggest ways these barriers may be alleviated in clinical and rehabilitation settings . Study 3 was unique in incorporating data from low vision rehabilitation professionals . Using a small survey distributed to participating clinics , we gained an idea of which devices were offered by that organization , how frequently each device was recommended to low vision patients , and training offered for reading aids . Taken together , the results of the patient and clinic surveys are relevant to a range of low vision practitioners in understanding how the initial consultation and training processes may be improved for better outcomes related to reading aid use and satisfaction . Our specific research questions for Study 3 are : Patient survey . 1 ) Which reading devices are low vision patients exposed to at an initial consultation ? Based on evidence from previous research ( Casten et al . , 2016 , Crossland et al . , 2014 ) and Study 2 , we expect non - electronic optical magnifiers to be more commonly suggested at consultation appointments than tablets / e - readers 97 2 ) Which devices are being used as reading aids for those with low vision ? Based on evidence from previous research ( Casten et al . , 2016 , Crossland et al . , 2014 ) , we expect non - electronic optical magnifiers to be more commonly used than tablets / e - readers as primary reading devices 3 ) What factors contribute to choice of device for leisure reading following an initial consultation ? Based on limited prior research ( Strong et al . , 2003 ) , one speculative expectation is that recommendations by professionals will play a primary role in device selection . 4 ) What is the state of satisfaction and use of the selected device one month after the consultation ? Due to unclear outcomes from previous research and Studies 1 and 2 , no specific expectations exist surrounding device satisfaction at a follow - up . Research on device abandonment is comparably mixed ( Batavia & Hammer , 1990 ; Riemer - Reiss & Wacker , 2000 ) . 5 ) What is the nature of the training patients receive with their selected device ? We anticipate patients will have little to no training after their initial consultation , as suggested by prior research ( Deol , 2012 ; Southall & Wittich , 2012 ) . 6 ) What are patients’ perceptions of tablets as leisure reading devices for low vision ? Based on Studies 1 and 2 , we expect patients to respond positively to tablets , but may be largely unaware of their capabilities as reading aids . This expectation 98 may be limited , however , by the methodology differences between the first two studies and Study 3 ( i . e . , Study 3 data collection was based on perceptions via image and verbal description rather than hands - on experience ) . Clinic survey . 1 ) Which reading aids are offered by participating clinics ? Based on evidence from previous research ( Casten et al . , 2016 , Crossland et al . , 2014 ) , we expect provision of non - electronic optical magnifiers to be more commonly offered than tablets / e - readers . 2 ) Which devices are most frequently recommended to low vision patients by clinicians ? Based on evidence from previous research ( Casten et al . , 2016 , Crossland et al . , 2014 ) , we expect provision of non - electronic optical magnifiers to be more commonly recommended than tablets / e - readers . 3 ) How often are patients referred to further training with a reading device ? We anticipate most patients will not be referred to more training after their initial consultation , as suggested by prior research ( Deol , 2012 ; Southall & Wittich , 2012 ) . 4 ) For what reasons are clinicians not recommending tablets and e - readers as primary reading devices ? Physicians and low vision specialists may be unaware of the benefits of tablets and e - readers or believe they’re inappropriate for their clients . Method Participants . 99 Patient survey . A conservative initial target sample size of 500 participants with a visual impairment was set to be recruited from a network of agencies across the United States . This number came from an a priori G * Power ( Erdfelder , Faul , & Buchner , 1996 ) analysis for 17 groups ( the number of reading devices to be compared ) with power of 0 . 9 and a small effect size ( 0 . 25 ) . Agencies were contacted through Vision Serve Alliance and invited to participate by completing an online enrollment form . Time constraints and low agency participation resulted in an actual sample size of 73 ( 38 female , 35 male ) . Patient referrals came from five agencies : Envision ( Wichita , Kansas ) , Lighthouse Louisiana , New View Oklahoma , Ensight Skills Center ( Fort Collins , Colorado ) , and Vista Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired ( Palo Alto , California ) . Patients were all over age 50 ( M = 76 . 67 , SD = 11 . 76 , Range = 47 ) , had a diagnosed visual impairment , and were native English speakers . Data were collected from patients who did ( n = 37 ) and did not ( n = 36 ) begin using a new device for leisure reading following their consultation appointment . Clinic survey . One low vision professional responsible for dispensing LVAs from five agencies in five separate states completed the clinic survey . Participants consisted of two occupational therapists , one ophthalmologist , one optometrist , and one assistive technology specialist . Materials . Survey questions were informed by previous literature ( Harper , Doorduyn , Reeves , & Slater , 1999 ; Hill et al . , 2004 ; Reeves et al . , 2004 ) , themes from Studies 1 and 2 , as well as interviews and pilot surveys with low vision researchers , occupational therapists , and low vision patients . Patient survey . Due to the diversity in age , sightedness , and internet / computer access of the patient population , data were collected through multiple avenues . Surveys 100 were administered by paper mail and an online survey developed with Qualtrics . Online surveys were dispersed via email . Surveys were also conducted by phone at the participant’s request upon receiving the phone by paper or email . Clinic survey . A link to an online Qualtrics survey was sent via email . Procedure . Patient survey . Participating clinics provided patient contact information to the research team after obtaining consent to contact for research participation . The patient survey was administered one to three months after participants’ consultation with a low vision rehabilitation professional in which they selected a new device for leisure reading . In the context of this study , an initial consultation constitutes any appointment with an eye care or low vision professional in which patients are exposed to a variety of possible reading aids . If participants did not select a new device to use for leisure reading following the appointment , they were given a condensed version of the full survey to assess their most recent appointment and their attitudes about tablet devices . In exchange for their participation , patients were entered to win a $ 50 gift card . The first set of questions included demographic items including visual diagnosis , age , gender , and income . Other relevant personal factors collected included reading habits , enjoyment of reading , and typical reading content . Awareness and training with reading devices were assessed by asking about the patient’s recent consultation . Items of interest included which devices were introduced to the patient and the extent of training received . Questions specific to the selected device were asked , including elements that contributed to the selection of the device , current device use , and current device satisfaction . Finally , a section specific to reading on tablets was administered to participants who did not select a 101 tablet or e - reader as their primary reading device following the consultation . Questions included familiarity with tablets , factors that led them to choose a different device , perceptions of tablets , and interest in using tablets as a reading aid . A copy of the patient surveys can be found in Appendix N ( new device ) and Appendix O ( no new device ) . Clinic survey . Questions administered to low vision rehabilitation professionals included the clinic name and location , the respondent’s professional title , devices offered by that clinic , and frequency of recommending each device to patients . Professionals who did not recommend tablets or e - readers at their clinic were directed to a question asking why they do not recommend these devices for reading . The clinic survey can be found in Appendix P . Results Patient survey . Analyses were conducted based on each of the six research questions , outlined in Table 3 .

Demographic information such as age , education , income , and visual diagnosis were collected at the beginning of the survey . This information is summarized in Appendix Q . Background data about reading habits and attitudes can be found in Appendix R . Devices demonstrated . Participants were asked which devices were demonstrated to them at their consultation appointment . Results showed that handheld magnifiers were the most common , followed by audio books and high power reading glasses . Fifteen people ( 21 . 4 % ) reported seeing a tablet at their consultation , and only 5 ( 7 . 1 % ) reported seeing an e - reader ( see Table 4 and Figure 31 ) . Table 4 Devices demonstrated at initial consultation appointment .

Only 14 % of patients saw more than five devices . Exploratory analysis showed that the number of devices demonstrated to the patient may contribute to whether they select a new device . An independent - samples t - test showed that those who selected a new device saw more devices on average ( M = 4 . 24 , SD = 2 . 42 ) than those who did not ( M = 2 . 91 , SD = 1 . 76 ) , t ( 68 ) = - 2 . 61 , p = 0 . 011 ( see Figure 32 and Table 5 ) . 105 Figure 31 .

Patients who did not select a new device at their most recent appointment were asked why they decided not to begin using a new device for leisure reading . Results showed that the most common reason was no longer reading due to low vision ( 16 , 44 . 4 % ) , followed by the feeling that none of the devices presented would help the patient’s ability to read ( 13 , 36 . 1 % ) . Lack of interest in leisure reading and lack of information or training with the demonstrated devices were reported by fewer than 5 participants ( see Figure 33 ) . 108 Figure 33 . Reasons for not selecting a new device as primary reading aid . Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals . n = 36 . Patients who selected a new device at their consultation were asked which device they elected to use as their primary leisure reading aid . Patients who did not begin using a new device after their appointment were asked which device they currently use for leisure reading , if any . Taken together , results showed that handheld magnifiers were the most common , followed by eyeglasses and audio books . Four people ( 5 . 8 % ) reported using a tablet as their primary reading aid , and only one ( 1 . 4 % ) reported using an e - reader ( Figure 109 34 ) . Of the people who did select a new device , handheld magnifiers and audio books were also the most common . Few selected a tablet ( 2 , 5 . 6 % ) or e - reader ( 1 , 1 . 3 % ) ( Figure 35 ) . See Table 6 . Table 6 Proportions indicating primary device selection among the total sample and those who selected a new device .

Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals . n = 36 . Though little data were collected on device cost ( n = 17 ) , slightly over half of participants paid over $ 100 for their device , with three people paying over $ 500 ( see Table 7 ) . 112 Table 7 Price paid for primary device . Cost Frequency Less than $ 100 8 ( 47 . 1 % ) $ 100 - $ 499 6 ( 35 . 3 % ) $ 500 - $ 999 1 ( 5 . 9 % ) $ 1000 or more 2 ( 11 . 8 % ) Selection of devices . Patients who selected a new device at their consultation were asked which factors most strongly contributed to their choice from 1 ( none at all ) to 5 ( contributed a great deal ) . Median ratings showed that ease of use and portability were highly influential , as well as recommendations by the low vision / rehabilitation professional . Familiarity with the device and cost were less important , with recommendations from friends / family being least important . ( see Figure 36 and Table 8 ) . 113 Figure 36 . Rationale for selecting the primary leisure reading aid . n = 24 – 31 . Satisfaction with devices . Patients who selected a new device at their consultation were asked about their satisfaction on a scale from 1 ( not at all satisfied ) to 5 ( very satisfied ) with the ease of use and effectiveness of the device , as well as satisfaction with their reading comprehension and speed . Median ratings indicated participants were 114 generally satisfied with their device in these respects , with the exception of speed ( Table 8 and Figure 37 ) .

Satisfaction with primary leisure reading aid . n = 29 – 31 . Current device use . Patients who selected a new device at their consultation were asked about their current device use . At the time of the survey , most participants ( 30 , 88 . 2 % ) were still using the same device they initially selected multiple times per day ( 19 , 65 . 5 % ) . See Figure 38 . 116 Figure 38 . Frequency of device use . Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals . n = 29 . Most participants reported using their devices for more than 30 minutes in one sitting ( 16 , 57 . 1 % ) , with 8 ( 28 . 6 % ) reporting using the device for more than an hour ( Figure 39 ) . 117 Figure 39 . Duration of device use in one sitting . Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals . n = 28 . Device training . Patients who selected a new device at their consultation were asked about the training they received to use their new device . Patients generally felt that the training they received allowed them to use their device effectively ( Figure 40 ) , despite most patients receiving no additional training ( 16 , 55 . 2 % ) . On average , patients received one additional training session ( range = 0 – 6 ) . 118 Figure 40 . Adequacy of training with device . Participants rated agreement with the statement : “ The training I received during my consultation was adequate for me to use my device effectively . ” Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals . n = 34 . Tablets . Most participants had little to no experience with tablets prior to the study . ( 33 , 57 . 9 % ) ( Figure 41 ) . Most of those who knew about tablets reported that they were introduced to them by friends and family ( 27 , 55 . 1 % ) ( Figure 42 ) . About half of patients knew that tablets could be used as low vision reading aids prior to the study ( Figure 43 ) . Of those that knew tablets could be used as a reading aid , most found out through low vision professionals , but nearly half learned through other sources ( Figure 44 ) . 119 Figure 41 .

Participants were shown images of tablets and asked about their interest in using a tablet to read , whether they believed tablets were affordable for them , and how easy a tablet would be to use . Responses were given on a scale of from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) . Median scores showed patients were uncertain about whether tablets would be affordable or easy for them to use . Scores indicating interest in using a tablet to 123 read leaned positive , with over 50 % of participants expressing interest ( a response of at least somewhat agree ) .

Participants who saw a tablet at their appointment but chose a different device were asked why they decided to select another device instead of a tablet . Options included affordability of tablets , familiarity with the device they chose , ease of using tablets , tablets seeming difficult to begin using , and tablets not offering the content they like to read . 126 Ratings were reported on a scale from 1 ( none at all ) to 5 ( a great deal ) , indicating the degree to which each factor contributed to their decision ( Figure 46 ) . Figure 46 . Reason for choosing another device instead of a tablet . n = 11 – 13 . Clinic survey . Analyses were conducted based on each of the four research questions , outlined in Table 10 . 127 Table 10 Study 3 clinic survey research questions and analyses . Recommended devices . Of the five low vision professionals that completed the clinic survey , most indicated offering more than 10 ( M = 12 . 2 , SD = 3 . 90 ) devices as leisure reading aids at their agency . The most common devices were stand magnifiers , handheld magnifiers , portable and desktop CCTVs , screen magnification software , and audio books / screen readers .

Participants rated the impact of a number of factors on their decision from 1 ( none at all ) to 5 ( a great deal ) . Median ratings showed that meeting the patient’s needs and ease of access to the device contributed most , followed by affordability to the patient .

Of the two agencies that did not include e - readers on their list of devices , and one that excluded tablets , no responses were given to the final open - end question asking why these devices are not suggested to clients . Discussion Demonstration and selection of devices . Results from questions about devices seen at the consultation confirmed the expectation that magnifiers would be commonly suggested , especially compared to tablets and e - readers . Data from patients were generally consistent with that of clinicians on which devices were most often demonstrated in sessions . Interestingly , participants reported seeing 3 . 6 devices on average at their appointment while clinics reported an average of over 12 device options . As evidenced by the clinic survey , the specific devices ( and the number of devices ) shown to patients may be determined on a case - by - case basis , highly dependent on patient needs and practical factors such as accessibility and cost of the device . It is not clear from our data how patient needs are determined , but as suggested by previous research emphasizing patient preference in addition to strictly clinical features ( Strong et al . , 2003 ) , exposure to more devices may be beneficial to patients . This is especially true if exposure to more devices is associated with selecting a new device , as our exploratory results suggest . More research is necessary to robustly determine other factors underlying the decision to begin using a new leisure reading device . The decision to not begin using a new device was driven largely by giving up reading due to their visual impairment , or the feeling that none of the devices would be helpful to them . It is important to note that many individuals who did not choose a device still appeared interested in leisure reading . This suggests the possibility that many people with 133 low vision who have a desire to continue reading for pleasure are not finding solutions . Our data suggest that patients placed high importance on continuing to read for pleasure , even if a new device was not selected at the most recent appointment ( Appendix R ) . A lack of solutions could be the result of many factors , including the patient’s visual state , comorbid conditions , their interest in reading despite diminished vision , their willingness to withstand the added difficulty and reduced speed , and many others . While exposure to new devices may be a piece of the puzzle , the current study does not cover the many potential causes for low vision patients foregoing reading devices despite a desire to read . Moving forward , it is important for industry professionals to be aware that patients desire leisurely reading , but harbor concerns about their visual ability and the devices’ effectiveness . When choosing a device for leisure reading , patients put high emphasis on ease of use , portability , and recommendations from professionals . Particularly interesting is the value placed on portability ; this supports the qualitative findings from Study 2 that suggested the context in which reading is done is an important factor for low vision readers , and more cumbersome devices like desktop CCTVs and desktop computers can be restricting . Satisfaction . Participants were generally satisfied with the performance of their devices , which is consistent with some of the previous work on device satisfaction ( Martin et al . , 2011 ) , but contradicts our small - sample research from Studies 1 and 2 . Speed was the lowest rated element of satisfaction ; this is to be expected for reading with low vision , but reinforces that improving speed is an important area of focus for improving satisfaction with devices . Considering patients tended to use their devices frequently and for extended 134 periods of time , attention should be paid to how devices will perform with prolonged use . Handheld magnifiers , for example , may deter people from longer periods of reading due to its physical demands . Although participants reported very little additional training beyond their initial consultation , reported adequacy of training was high . It is encouraging that patients feel equipped to effectively use their devices after reading with them at home for a number of weeks or months . However , given the research on the benefits of additional rehabilitation , it’s possible that patients experience a disconnect with confidence in their device training without knowing the full potential of its benefits . We emphasize the importance of follow - up visits and rehabilitation referrals to observe and assess patients’ use of their devices to ensure they maximize its advantages . Tablets . Tablets and e - readers were reported as relatively infrequent in the consultation compared to the demonstration of other devices . Although the surveyed clinics reported tablets and e - readers as recommended devices , they were recommended about half as often as handheld magnifiers . This outcome is not necessarily surprising given previous research ( Casten et al . , 2016 ) , but is discouraging given the growing research suggesting the benefits of digital devices for low vision reading . When compa ring devices demonstrated to the devices chosen , it’s interesting to see that although 15 participants reported seeing a tablet at their consultation , only four listed it as their primary device after the session . For e - readers , five reported seeing one at their appointment and only one elected to use one moving forward . Of those that saw tablets / e - readers but chose another device , affordability and familiarity were the top reasons they decided against one of these digital readers . Given the high price several participants paid 135 for their chosen device , it’s possible these devices are perceived as more costly than they are . More research is necessary to determine how patients determine affordability and how tablets / e - readers compare to what they’re willing to spend . Lack of familiarity is not surprising given results from this study and Study 2 indicating less awareness about tablets compared to other devices . Consistent with Casten et al . ’s ( 2016 ) findings , the vast majority of participants learned about tablets through sources other than rehabilitation personnel . Once again , this is concerning given the apparent potential benefits of these devices . Our study supplements Casten et al . ’s findings by also showing that almost half of patients did not realize tablets could be used for low vision reading . Given the growing literature on the utility of tablets for low vision reading , and supported by the qualitative work in Study 2 , we urge rehabilitation professionals to expose patients to these devices and allow them the opportunity to familiarize themselves with what may be an entirely novel platform . Results suggest that patients are open to tablets as reading devices , as more than half expressed interest in using the devices as a reading aid . Concern for cost and ease of use could be addressed by rehabilitation specialists in providing adequate information on the variety of available options , reading content available on tablets , and attentive training . Limitations and future research . This study was limited in a number of ways . Our sample size was lower than anticipated , which makes generalization more difficult and comparisons across devices or other variables less meaningful . We also could not obtain reliable data on clinical features of patients , so it is unclear how well our sample represents the general low vision population . 136 The survey format represented several challenges . The list of devices was long and may have made it difficult for patients to identify devices solely by name . Attaining perceptions of tablets via photos and verbal descriptions is also less ideal than if participants were able to physically see and handle the device themselves . Given that many responses were received by paper survey , missing data and attrition were also issues in reducing the sample size for some variables . Findings about device satisfaction appeared to be inconsistent in Study 3 compared to the first two studies indicating low satisfaction with their current method . Study 3 satisfaction ratings differed by factor ( e . g . , speed ratings were lower than ease of use ) , implying the benefit of focusing on a multi - dimensional approach to assessing satisfaction rather than a single scale . Our results suggest that a high sample of low vision patients that currently use devices other than handheld magnifiers may be difficult to achieve in the immediate future . However , subsequent research should focus on how satisfaction may change depending on the device selected and with more time using the device . Future studies may also look more deeply at the depth of demonstration occurring during consultation appointments . It is unclear from our results the level of experience and instruction patients had with each device option . This information could help us better understand the role of immersion and engagement with provision of novel devices . 137 CHAPTER 5 GENERAL DISCUSSION Because previous research has focused almost exclusively on reading performance , this series of studies aimed to analyze aspects of reading satisfaction , particularly in the context of reading for pleasure . When subjective data have been collected in prior studies , the measure is typically a preference between multiple tested devices or a single scale to assess satisfaction ( Longenecker Rust et al . , 2004 ; Watson et al . , 2005 ) . Our approach offers a more detailed evaluation of satisfaction with low vision reading devices . Taken together , the present studies fulfill a need expressed by other researchers in the field ( Bowers et al . , 2004 ; Harvey et al . , 2014 ; Strong et al . , 2003 ) to focus on patient preference and subjective measures of satisfaction for reading aids . Limitations A few limitations across all studies are worth addressing . All three studies employed a sample size lower than anticipated . However , results can still be a valuable starting point for future research , and descriptively show the trends identified from our samples . In particular , the diary methodology in Study 2 allows us to be more confident in the qualitative data despite having nine participants . ( Pope , Ziebland , & Mays , 2000 ) . Future studies will be valuable to extend our model to be more robust in its representation of the larger visually impaired population that uses a variety of aids . The conclusions drawn from our quantitative data will evolve as more data are collected over time . These studies may also be limited by the recruitment procedure . By only recruiting patients who have attended a rehabilitation appointment , our results may overestimate certain aspects of device awareness , training , and satisfaction . It is unclear how well our 138 results generalize to the population of low vision patients who have not sought formal appointments to obtain reading devices . Contributions Results of Study 3 supported the findings of Studies 1 and 2 in that patients appear receptive and interested in using a device like a tablet . However , results also supported the qualitative findings from Study 2 that patients may be largely unaware that tablets can be used as a reading device . Very few patients were using tablets or e - readers as their primary leisure reading device . Taken together , these findings imply that tablets and e - readers may be under - represented in recommendations by practitioners . The fact that costly devices like desktop CCTVs appear to be recommended more frequently by practitioners is surprising considering modern alternatives ( e . g . , TV monitors , camera - equipped mice , and smart phone / tablet cameras combined with accessibility apps ) can offer essentially identical features for a fraction of the price ( Natarajan , 2013 ) . Of course , there will be a proportion of patients that elect not to use a leisure reading device due to lack of interest or motivation . Low vision specialists want to provide the most impactful and effective solutions for their clients , and it could be that leisure reading is not established as a highly valuable need during rehabilitation . However , we can speculate on why these devices are underutilized for those that do seek to continue reading . Study 3 showed that people who did not select a tablet as their primary reading aid still tended to express interest in using the device after seeing an example and description . The most common reasons for selecting a different device instead imply there may be a disconnect between patients and practitioners regarding the cost and practicality , 139 especially considering many participants spent more than the cost of a basic tablet on their selected aid . The importance of familiarity lends more credence to the idea that extended , hands - on experience and training may be critical to making the best decision about which device will best suit patient needs . We also saw that perceptions about text presentations and tablets changed when given time with these methods in Studies 1 and 2 . Where possible , an extended trial period with a variety of devices might yield better long term outcomes . Prior research has found that LVAs are often used for multiple tasks ( Watson et al . , 1997 ) . One possibility is that patients could be selecting a more general - use device that allows for a wider breadth of tasks . Rather than using one device for spot reading ( e . g . , reading medicine labels or menus ) or writing and another for prolonged leisure reading , i t’s possible that practitioners , patients , or both favor devices that could theoretically serve both purposes . If patients feel they are choosing between functional and leisure reading , this could lead function to take priority . Some specialists do advise that patients are better served with multiple devices for different activities ( Switliski , 2007 ; Watson et al . , 1997 ) . Another possibility is a lack of comprehensive , accessible software for older adults with low vision . While apps , software , and accessibility features exist for those with low vision , there is no single device that affords : 1 ) the capabilities of an e - reader and its simple access to content , and 2 ) the flexibility of a tablet in screen size and compatibility with other apps and features as desired . It may also benefit some readers to have options for scrolling and RSVP reading for those that could benefit from dynamic presentations . In its current form , a tablet or e - reader ma y require multiple “work - arounds” to be truly beneficial to a low vision reader , and this adds a layer of complexity for those unfamiliar 140 with the technology . Providing a device with specialized software intended for an older low vision population could make this option more compelling for specialists responsible for device provision . Given the recent emergence of publications on the effectiveness of tablets for low vision , it could also be that more time and dispersion of recent research is necessary to change practice and encourage the provision of more modern devices . In particular , more research would be useful to demonstrate that leisure reading is still important to people with low vision and they are willing and able to use tablets and e - readers for this purpose . Increased standardization of the device provision process would also likely be impactful for improving device awareness and referrals to rehabilitation , as suggested by prior studies ( Adelsberger et al . , 2014 , Casten et al . , 2005 ) . Though practitioners reported patient needs as the most important driver in the devices they recommend , results from our studies suggest there may be a discrepancy between patients’ functional goals and practitioner perceptions of patient needs . Patients reported that continuing to read for pleasure is highly important to them , but many have given up leisure reading due to their vision . More research would be valuable to fully understand the reasons people give up reading despite high motivation to continue . Future research is also needed to develop a comprehensive , well - defined metric for assessing patient needs and satisfaction with low vision aids , as noted previously in research ( Longenecker Rust et al . , 2004 ) . Defining satisfaction and devising more consistent measures would contribute to the standardization that prior research also calls for in rehabilitation programs ( Adelsberger et al . , 2014 ; Smallfield et al . , 2013 ) , and ideally facilitate more communication between clients and providers . 141 To aid in bridging this gap , Study 3 provided a follow - up on satisfaction and device use that can be useful to specialists in understanding frequency and duration of device use after provision . The qualitative model developed in Study 2 can also provide practitioners with an idea of what aspects of reading may be most important to low vision readers . By detailing a model that emphasizes satisfaction in reading , this work presents providers with an idea of reading assessment that looks beyond performance . Our results suggest that even non - readers can be re - engaged with the right device and reading format . We observed that even patients with the most significant vision loss could still find pleasure in reading , and strongly desired to continue doing so . Given our knowledge of the expense of giving up activities like leisure reading , it is critical that practitioners and academics are aligned in an effort to help patients to maintain the pleasure of reading as long as possible . 142 REFERENCES 143 REFERENCES Adelsberger , J . , Bertolet , A . , Humphreys , E . , Kreydin , I . , Woodward , H . , & Zebrowski , J .

See the summary table and description below . Phase Process 1 . Familiarizing yourself with your data : Transcribing data ( if necessary ) , reading and re - reading the data , noting down initial ideas . 2 . Generating initial codes : Coding interesting features of the data in a systematic fashion across the entire data set , collating data relevant to each code . 3 . Searching for themes : Collating codes into potential themes , gathering all data relevant to each potential theme . 4 . Reviewing themes : Checking if the themes work in relation to the coded extracts ( Level 1 ) and the entire data set ( Level 2 ) , generating a thematic ‘map’ of the analysis . 5 . Defining and naming themes : Ongoing analysis to refine the specifics of each theme , and the overall story the analysis tells , generating clear definitions and names for each theme . 6 . Producing the report : The final opportunity for analysis . Selection of vivid , compelling extract examples , final analysis of selected extracts , relating back of the analysis to the research question and literature , producing a scholarly report of the analysis . A second researcher participated in coding to provide perspective from a contrasting background and alleviate potential bias introduced by the primary researcher that conducted the interviews . Rather than a calculation of inter - rater reliability , 186 agreement was attained qualitatively via iterative discussion and revision , a common approach in the literature ( Berends & Johnston , 2005 ) . This method improved the clarity and quality of codes by eliciting opportunities to identify and discuss areas of disagreement . As Barbour ( 2001 ) states , the true advantage of multiple coders lies in the “content of [ coding ] disagreements and the insights that discussions can provide to refine coding frames’’ ( p . 1 , 116 ) . The result was a more clearly defined , less ambiguous set of codes that integrated both high and low levels of familiarity with the subject matter . The first phase of analysis was familiarization with the data . Data from interviews were transcribed and read thoroughly to ensure immersion and organization of the text . Data from each participant were initially organized by topic in a spreadsheet . Initial notes were taken to reflect emerging patterns and potential codes . Both researchers read through the data set then came together to review notes and discuss codes . An initial coding set was developed by discussion . In the next phase , coding was done on segments of data to identify and describe meaningful content that could eventually contribute to broader themes . Data were split into three stages of the study by initial interviews ( beginning ) , phone interviews ( middle ) , and final interviews ( end ) . Both researchers independently coded the data , then worked together to resolve any differences and arrive at final interpretations as suggested by Bradley , Curry , and Devers ( 2007 ) . The end result was a co - constructed set of codes applied to the data set . Once coding was complete , identifying patterned extracts of data with respect to the research questions led to the development of themes and sub - themes . Both researchers independently used the existing codes and framed them into categories , mapping how 187 codes were grouped and connected to one another . Researchers then came together to discuss variation in the themes and arrive at a consensus after revisiting the data where relevant . Themes were subsequently refined for clarity and cohesion by reviewing coded extracts for each theme . For example , themes supported by too little data were discarded or reorganized into a broader theme . The coded extracts within each theme were reviewed to ensure they fit together and accurately supported the theme in which they’re placed . Themes were then considered with respect to the data set as a whole . Data segments were reread to ensure the themes captured each important pattern in the data . Rereading also confirmed that no extracts were excluded that belonged in a particular theme . Themes and sub - themes were then formally defined to describe the aspects of the data captured by each theme . Each analyst did this in turn and compared results to reach agreement . The final phase consisted of a formal write - up of the analysis by the primary researcher , including specific data extracts . A diagram was developed to describe the features of a satisfactory reading experience and an effective reading device . To shape this interpretation , we considered p articipants’ attitudes toward each method , comparisons to their typical method , and any strategies or adaptive behaviors that emerged . 188 APPENDIX K STUDY 2 CODES FOR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS Code Name Code Description Accuracy Concern for encoding words , navigating text correctly and reducing reading errors App Features Any mention of app functionality , flexibility , or settings Automatic Text presentation without having to move eyes Awareness Knowledge of reading techniques or devices Backlight Tablet screen light Comprehension Understanding and focusing on the reading material Contrast Ease of distinguishing text from background Convenient Sense of ease , lack of effort or practical limitation Cost Mention of monetary cost associated with devices Determination Perseverance and motivation to keep reading despite difficulty Dynamic Text Motion of words or “automatic” nature of the text presentation Easy Ease of reading with a method or device Enjoyment Expression of fun and pleasure while reading 189 Code Name Code Description Environment Setting in which reading takes place Eyestrain Mentions specific to eye pain or discomfort Familiar Comments about having experience with a method , or a technique that ' s " what I ' m used to " Feature Flexibility Reference to the ability to adjust elements of text presentation ( e . g . , " I can change the speed " ) Hands Free Mentions of not having to use both hands while reading and holding reading material Immersion Involvement and interest in reading content Kickstand Mention of the kickstand feature on the tablet Lighting Lamps or other lighting used in the environment for reading , or mentions of backlight on an electronic device Line Spacing Spacing between lines Lose Place Difficulty finding the correct line or word in text , or picking up where they left off after a break Margins Comments about margins Mental Effort Mention of cognitive demand or pressure ( e . g . , " I found it hard to focus " ) Miss Lines Skipping lines or reading the wrong lines when reading Miss Words References to missing words as a result of automatic presentation . 190 Code Name Code Description Natural Sense of fluidity or cohesiveness that aligns with the normal cadence of reading ( e . g . , " feels fluid , " " can go at my own pace " ) Navigation A sense of awareness of the text layout and location in the book or chapter ( e . g . , " I wish I knew how many pages I had left " ) Novel Discussing a lack of familiarity with a method or device , or references of getting " used to it " Physical Demand Reference to manual physical exertion when using a device ( e . g . , " My arm gets tired , " " Requires a lot of tapping " ) Portable Flexibility for where and how the device can be used Reflection Mention of glare or reflection from the tablet screen Resolution Comment about the resolution of a screen Screen Size Comment about the size of a screen Speed Specific references to how fast or slow they can read , or how much time it takes to read .
