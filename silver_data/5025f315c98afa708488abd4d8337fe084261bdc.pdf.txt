Do " bad " citations have " good " effects ? Honglin Bao 1 * and Misha Teplitskiy 2 * 1 Harvard Business School , 2 School of Information , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor * To whom correspondence may be addressed : Misha Teplitskiy , tepl @ umich . edu , 105 S State St , Ann Arbor , MI 48109 , USA Honglin Bao , hbao @ hbs . edu , 50 North Harvard Street , Allston , MA 02163 , USA Abstract The scientific community discourages authors of research papers from citing papers that did not influence them . Such " rhetorical " citations are assumed to degrade the literature and incentives for good work . While a world where authors cite only substantively appears attractive , we argue that mandating substantive citing may have underappreciated consequences on the allocation of attention and dynamism in scientific literatures . We develop a novel agent - based model in which agents cite substantively and rhetorically . Agents first select papers to read based on their expected quality , read them and observe their actual quality , become influenced by those that are sufficiently good , and substantively cite them . Next , agents fill any remaining slots in the reference lists by ( rhetorically ) citing papers that support their narrative , regardless of whether they were actually influential . By turning rhetorical citing on - and - off , we find that rhetorical citing increases the correlation between quality and citations , increases citation churn , and reduces citation inequality . This occurs because rhetorical citing redistributes some citations from a stable set of elite - quality papers to a more dynamic set with high - to - moderate quality and high rhetorical value . Increasing the size of reference lists , often seen as an undesirable trend , amplifies the effects . In sum , rhetorical citing helps deconcentrate attention and makes it easier to displace incumbent ideas , so whether it is indeed undesirable depends on the metrics used to judge desirability . Keywords : Publishing , citations , inequality , science of science 1 . Introduction Citations are widely used in science to measure the impact of papers and researchers . The assumption underlying this evaluative use of citations is that scientists generally follow the norm that citations acknowledge intellectual debts to prior work ( Baldi , 1998 ; Zuckerman , 1987 ) . If most citations are indeed of this " substantive " type , the enormously laborious and subjective task of assessing the impact of research becomes a relatively straightforward and objective one – just count the citations . However , decades of research show that many citations reflect motivations that have little , if anything , to do with acknowledging intellectual debts ( Bornmann & Daniel , 2008 ) . According to the social constructivist theory of citing , authors cite works to persuade readers and reviewers , regardless of whether the works influenced the authors ( Gilbert , 1977 ; Cozzens , 1989 ; Latour & Woolgar , 2013 ; Nicolaisen , 2007 ) . We refer to these as " rhetorical " citations ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Rhetorical citations help authors persuade audiences and navigate the publishing process in several ways . Some rhetorical citations provide context ( Allen , 1997 ) or differentiate the citer ' s contributions from prior works by criticizing them ( Catalini et al . , 2015 ) . Some rhetorical citations are " coerced " during peer review ( Wilhite & Fong , 2012 ) . Consistent with these relatively superficial uses of the literature , studies find that in many cases authors misrepresent the claims of the papers they cite ( Cobb et al . , 2023 ) and do not read them thoroughly ( Simkin & Roychowdhury , 2005 ) . Authors can usually differentiate whether a citation was made to acknowledge intellectual debts or for other purposes ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) , supporting the distinction between substantive and rhetorical citations . Authors need not be indifferent to a paper ' s quality when considering citing it rhetorically . For example , prominent papers may bolster the citer ' s claims more than obscure papers ( Rubin & Rubin , 2021 ) , a phenomenon sometimes called " persuasion by naming - dropping " ( White , 2004 ; Frandsen & Nicolaisen , 2017 ) . Nevertheless , quality plays at most an indirect role in rhetorical citing – the author ' s own perception of a paper ' s quality is much less relevant than how potential readers perceive its quality , because the higher the latter , the more persuasive the paper . Rhetorical citing is generally seen as an undesirable practice that corrupts the literature and incentives for future research ( Penders , 2018 ) . The view is so common and uncontroversial that the journal Nature Genetics has gone as far as to explicitly warn that manuscripts citing rhetorically will be rejected ( Nature Genetics Editorials , 2017 ) . Even aside from official policies , some argue that rhetorical citing is a signal of low - quality work ( Petric , 2007 ; Rose , 2014 ) . The view that rhetorical citing is undesirable implicitly compares the current world with rhetorical citing to a counterfactual world without it . Yet a rigorous comparison between the two worlds does not exist and , as we argue below , is worth conducting because which world is preferable is unclear ex ante . This is because the counterfactual world with only substantive citing is likely to be one in which attention is concentrated on only the few best papers , and their advantage becomes locked - in over time . Thus , the first contribution of this paper is to conduct such a comparison . To do so , we use a novel , behavioral model of the citing process , which is the paper ' s second contribution . The model combines substantive and rhetorical motivations to cite , along with cognitively realistic search and reading practices . Formulating a comprehensive theory of citing has been a challenge in information and library science for many decades ( Cronin , 1981 ) . The main existing theories – normative and social constructivist – have been criticized as incomplete as stand - alone theories ( Cozzens , 1989 ; Nicolaisen , 2007 ) , and there is little consensus on an overall synthetic theory ( Bornmann & Daniel , 2008 ; Tahamtan & Bornmann , 2019 ) . This paper proposes such a synthesis . The guiding intuition is that researchers ' cognitive constraints prevent them from reading all relevant papers . Instead , when seeking papers to read and possibly cite substantively , researchers will use heuristics like citation counts to identify papers they expect to have the highest quality . Their attention is then likely to concentrate on a small number of the most cited ( or otherwise highest - status ) works and only papers from this set would get cited ( Chu & Evans , 2021 ; Parolo et al . , 2015 ) . The feedback loop between citing and more citing would lock - in certain papers as winners and make it difficult for new ideas to receive attention . In contrast to substantive citing , when citing rhetorically researchers consider other , non - quality related factors , i . e . papers ' rhetorical value , and this weighting of non - quality factors redistributes some attention away from the highest - status works and gives other papers a chance to be cited . In other words , rhetorical citing helps to weaken the feedback loop and makes science more dynamic , at least as measured in terms of citations . Empirically , comparing scientific communities with and without rhetorical citing is challenging . First , there may not exist any communities without rhetorical citing ( Teplitskiy et al . 2022 ) . Our model addresses this challenge by simulating artificial communities with arbitrary levels of rhetorical citing . This enables us to turn rhetorical citing " on " and " off " and measure its effects . Second , even if such communities did exist , classifying citations as substantive or rhetorical is difficult . One approach uses machine learning and training data from third - party labelers ( Jurgens et al . , 2018 ; Nicholson et al . , 2021 ) , but how well such labels correspond to authors ' actual motivations is unclear . Teplitsky et al . ( Teplitsky et al . , 2022 ) use a survey approach , asking authors why they cited a specific paper . However , surveys may have response biases , and are difficult to do at large scale . We address this challenge by building into our model two citation types - substantive and rhetorical . Third , to establish whether particular citing practices have deleterious effects on the health of a scientific community it is important to identify compelling measures of health . After surveying the literature we identified three outcomes and the associated measures that are often seen as capturing aspects of health : citation - quality correlation , citation churn ( i . e . , the replacement of reference list and disruption of the established canon ) , and citation inequality . The rest of this paper is structured as follows . Section 2 reviews empirical stylized facts about scientific information search , reading , and citing practices . Section 3 describes three metrics commonly taken to reflect the health of scientific communities . Section 4 describes the agent - based model . Section 5 presents the results of the main comparison , as well as the effects of changing the reading and citing budgets and literature sizes . Sections 6 and 7 discuss the findings and conclusions . 2 . Search , reading and citing practices We first describe several stylized facts about how researchers search for , read , and cite papers that underlie the model developed in Section 4 . These stylized facts , some of which are rather cynical , are not ones we endorse or seek to normalize . They are simply practices that , to the best of our knowledge , are well supported by empirical studies . Reading Researchers do not read all potentially relevant papers 1 , but select which ones to read strategically ( Tenopir et al . , 2015 ; Renear & Palmer , 2009 ) . A key criterion for selecting among 1 For conciseness we refer to various types of research works , e . g . , papers , books , as " papers . " relevant papers is quality ( or " fitness " ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) ) – scientists prioritize reading ( even if not citing ) the best papers ( Wang & Domas White , 1999 ) . Identifying the best papers to read is challenging since quality can be hard to discern at a glance . Researchers instead use heuristics ( Lerman et al . , 2017 ; Petersen et al . , 2014 ) . One commonly used heuristic is a paper ' s or author ' s status , which is assumed to proxy quality ( Simcoe & Waguespack , 2010 ; Wang & Soergel , 1998 ; Azoulay et al . , 2013 ) . Citation count is one component of status ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Thus , when scientists search for papers to read , they are likely to prioritize the highly cited ones . Heuristic - based selection can cause attention and citations to increasingly concentrate among the highest cited works , due to the feedback loop between current selections and future selections ( Peterson et al . , 2014 ) . Citing substantively Citing to acknowledge intellectual debts is often referred to as the " normative " theory of citing ( Nicolaisen , 2007 ; Bornmann & Daniel , 2008 ) . This theory posits that there is a norm in science to acknowledge intellectual debts ( Merton , 1973 ) and researchers hold themselves to this norm . To use more colloquial terminology , we call normative citations " substantive . " Substantive citing presupposes reading , since it is difficult to be substantively influenced by a work without knowing its contents . The styled facts around selection and cumulative advantage in reading described above should also apply to substantive citing . For example , if a researcher tends to select papers with high perceived quality to read , she will tend to only substantively cite ( and be influenced by ) papers with high perceived quality ( not actual quality ) . Citing rhetorically Authors also cite works to persuade readers , regardless of whether the works had substantive influences on them ( Nicolaisen , 2007 ; Gilbert , 1977 ) . We refer to this type of citing as " rhetorical . " Because rhetorical citing does not require influence , it does not require close ( and , at the extreme , any ) reading . The non - necessity of reading is supported by several lines of evidence . Studies comparing what citers of papers claim those papers say vs . what they actually say show frequent disagreements and distortions ( Horbach et al . , 2021 ; Leigh Star , 2010 ; Mizruchi & Fein , 1999 ) , with 9 . 5 % of a sample of psychology citations being outright mischaracterizations of the underlying papers ( Cobb et al . , 2023 ) . Cases of very specific mistakes in what a paper is taken to claim or in its actual reference string are difficult to explain except through a lack of careful reading ( Rekdal , 2014 ; Simkin & Roychowdhury , 2005 ) . Lastly , in surveys authors report citing papers without carefully reading them and / or without being influenced by them ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Researchers are likely to select papers for rhetorical citations based on their " rhetorical value , " which can be affected by time - invariant characteristics like quality ( Gilbert , 1977 ) and publication outlet , but also time - varying characteristics like citations and the status of the authors ( Azoulay et al . , 2013 ; Rubin & Rubin , 2021 ) . A paper ' s rhetorical value is likely to increase the more it is cited ( Lerman et al . , 2017 ) . High citation counts make papers appear to be of higher quality , more significant , more novel , and more generalizable ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ; Hargens , 2000 ; Allen , 1997 ) . The relative rhetorical value of a paper can thus increase ( or decrease ) over time . Rhetorical value of a paper is also likely to differ from researcher - to - researcher , based on how well the paper ' s claims match the researcher ' s objectives . For example , when two researchers write on a controversial topic and cite rhetorically , a paper that supports one side of the controversy may be rhetorically valuable for one researcher and less valuable for the other ( Shwed & Bearman , 2010 ) . The rhetorical value of a paper is thus likely to vary between researchers , depend on some time - invariant characteristics like quality and fit , and change over time as it accrues status , citations , or becomes obsolete . 3 . Metrics of community health In order to rigorously compare scientific communities with and without rhetorical citing , we identified in the literature three dimensions of community " health " – citation - quality correlation , citation churn , and citation inequality . We do not take these dimensions as exhaustive ( we return to this point in the Discussion ) , and only claim that they are commonly discussed . For each of the three metrics we develop a hypothesis , based on the intuition that in a world without rhetorical citing , attention and citations would be highly concentrated among the few elite - quality papers . In contrast , because rhetorical citing depends on factors beyond quality , it redistributes some attention and citations to good - but - not - elite papers . Low - quality papers are generally not cited substantively or rhetorically because they are not good or persuasive . We then consider the moderating effects on these characteristics of the reading budget ( how many papers researchers read ) , citing budget ( how many references they may put in a paper ) , and the literature size ( the number of papers relevant to a scientist in a period of time ) . Metric 1 : Citations - quality correlation Despite long - standing critiques of citations ( and metrics derived from them , like journal impact factor and h - index ) as a measure of quality , in practice , they are often used as such by administrators and analysts ( Bornmann & Daniel , 2008 ) . Researchers themselves perceive more highly cited papers as of higher quality ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Regardless of whether citations should be used as a proxy for quality , if they are , it is arguably better that they are a good proxy rather than a bad one . Consequently , we assume that the higher the correlation between quality and citations , the better for the community . Rhetorical citing can make the correlation stronger . With only substantive citing , the citation distribution becomes in effect bimodal , with high - quality papers receiving all of them and others receiving 0 citations . With rhetorical citing , researchers consider a variety of factors beyond quality and , consequently , citations are more evenly and proportionally distributed across low - to high - quality papers . The more proportional distribution will have a stronger correlation . Hypothesis 1 : Rhetorical citations increase the citation - quality correlation . Metric 2 : Citation churn As knowledge in a field evolves , some ideas receive increasing support and , eventually , may become taken - for - granted or " blackboxed " ( Latour , 1987 ) . In a healthy community , if new ideas arise that are better than the old ones , they should be recognized as such , and the old ones should be displaced . Such disruptive ideas are associated with higher novelty ( Lin et al . , 2022 ) and are predictive of the highest level of recognition in the scientific community , like the Nobel prize ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . A robust amount of turnover in reference lists across time , which we call " citation churn , " may thus indicate a healthy evolution of published knowledge . In contrast , if the same set of papers remains the highest cited decade after decade , the community may experience stagnation . Indeed , empirical work suggests that such stagnation is on the rise ( Chu & Evans , 2021 ; Evans , 2008 ; Park et al . , 2023 ; Parolo et al . , 2015 ) . Rhetorical citing may increase citation churn by reducing lock - in . Different researchers may find different papers rhetorically useful , e . g . , supporting their own claims , and not concentrate their attention and citations on only elite - quality papers . The more equal distribution of citations then weakens the feedback loop from current to future citations . Hypothesis 2 : Rhetorical citing increases the citation churn . Metric 3 : Citation inequality Scholarship has long found that the distribution of citations is highly skewed ( Price , 1963 ) , and that inequality appears to be increasing with time ( Nielsen & Andersen , 2021 ; Gomez et al . , 2022 ) . This degree of inequality is often described as problematic ( Nielsen & Andersen , 2021 ) , and possibly indicative of stagnation ( Chu & Evans , 2021 ; Parolo et al . , 2015 ) . While the optimal degree of inequality is debated , there is evidence that the realized degree is affected by factors such as technology ( Evans , 2008 ) and even seemingly irrelevant factors like choice architecture ( Feenberg et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we follow this latter literature in investigating the effect of rhetorical citing on citation inequality , without taking a strong position on what amount is optimal for science . In a world with substantive citing only , citations would be concentrated among the highest - quality papers , and that concentration would increase via the feedback loop of researchers choosing highly cited works to read and citing them yet more . Rhetorical citing may decrease citation inequality because researchers select papers to cite rhetorically based on a variety of idiosyncratic factors like person - specific rhetorical value , not only quality . Hypothesis 3 : Rhetorical citing decreases citation inequality . Moderating effects of literature size , and reading and citing budgets The relationships between rhetorical citing and the metrics above may be moderated by several characteristics of a scientific community . First , consider literature size , or the number of papers relevant to a particular researcher . While literature size can change dramatically over time and topic , scientists ' cognitive constraints are relatively stable . The stability of cognition implies that the number of papers scientists are capable of reading and being influenced by is also relatively stable . The larger the literature size , the smaller the fraction of papers a scientist will read and cite . Consequently , the larger the literature ( while keeping citing budgets and other factors fixed ) , the more unequal the citation distribution . Relatedly , the more unequal the citation distribution , the lower the quality - citations correlation . Hypothesis 4 : the larger the literature size , the greater the citation inequality and the lower the quality - citation correlation . We also expect the metrics of community health to be affected by researchers ' reading and citing " budgets " – the number of papers they can realistically read , and are expected by specific fields and outlets to cite , respectively . While researchers ' reading practices are difficult to measure at scale , the typical number of references in a paper is easily observable , and varies widely across fields and time ( Andersen , 2023 ) . We expect researchers to know their reading and citing budgets . Citing budgets are of particular interest from a policy perspective , as they can be and are routinely set by publishing outlets 2 . The more a researcher reads – the higher the reading " budget " – the more likely she is to give attention to non - elite - quality papers . However , if the researcher is limited to a small set of references , the slots will continue to go to papers that have had a substantive influence , presumably those of elite quality , and the additional papers will not be cited . When the reference list is expanded , for example by allowing rhetorical citations , researchers have more opportunities to populate it with non - elite - quality but rhetorically useful papers . Larger citing budgets , but not reading budgets alone , should thus reduce citation inequality , improve the correlation between citations and quality , and increase citation churn . Hypothesis 5A : Increasing the citing budget ( length of reference list ) increases citation - quality correlation and citation churn , and reduces citation inequality . Hypothesis 5B : The independent effect of increasing the reading budget is minor . 4 . Formalizing the model This section takes the search , reading and citing practices described in Section 2 and formalizes them into a family of models that vary from the simplest , e . g . , homogeneous agents , to more 2 For example , Nature recommends that authors of research articles limit themselves to 50 references . https : / / www . nature . com / nature / for - authors / formatting - guide . Accessed 2023 - 04 - 02 . complex and realistic , e . g . , heterogeneous agents . When agents are homogeneous , they perceive the quality and rhetorical values of papers identically , and when they are heterogeneous , a paper may have a higher topical or rhetorical " fit " and therefore higher value to one agent than another . A key feature of adoption models like these is the strength of the " reinforcement " or " social influence " process – the degree to which an agent ' s adoption in a time period is determined by adoption by other agents in a previous period ( Denrell & Liu , 2021 ) . We parametrize the strength of reinforcement with two parameters and , for substantive and rhetorical values respectively . α β Additionally , modelers sometimes include mechanisms that prevent runaway reinforcement , which can lead to the unrealistic phenomenon of guaranteed adoption ( van de Rijt , 2019 ; Zuckerman , 2012 ) . For example , some assume that the reinforcement effect decays over time ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) . To simplify the model , we do not impose a ceiling on the strength of reinforcement , which is clearly unrealistic in the long - run . Consequently , a key scope condition of our models is that they model citing in the short - to - medium run . Our models follow the logic of classic threshold adoption models ( Granovetter , 1978 ; Centola , 2011 ) , where agents choose a work to cite if it exceeds some person - specific threshold , with one crucial change : we allow for multiple types of adoption . The way agents , papers , and agent - paper are modeled is enumerated below , and Table 1 summarizes the parameters and their distributions . Table 1 . Parameters used in the model .

Agents substantively adopt ( cite ) a τ 𝑗 paper when its value to them exceeds a threshold . Homogeneous agents have identical thresholds , while heterogeneous agents differ in their thresholds . For agents with very high thresholds , very few papers will meet that bar for a substantive citation , so more of the reference list will be composed of rhetorical citations . In this way , thresholds help determine the composition of the reference list , even when its overall length is fixed . ● Reading budget m : Agents can read a maximum of m papers , which they select based on perceived ( not necessarily actual ) quality . ● Citing budget n : Agents can cite a maximum of n papers . Characteristics of paper i for agent j ● Quality and fit : A paper i ' s underlying quality is represented by , following Beta ( 1 , 6 ) 𝑞 𝑖 in the paper population . Underlying quality does not have an index j because it is assumed to be identical for all agents . Fit denotes the substantive usefulness of paper i for agent j , represented by . Fit is expected to vary across agents due to differences in 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 topic or preferences , i . e . , agents may choose not to read even a terrific paper if it is on too unrelated a topic . For homogeneous agents , . will raise or lower the 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 = 0 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 quality of paper i in agent j ' s eyes as in Equation 1 : 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑗 ( 1 ) 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑗 = 𝑞 𝑖 + 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 ● Perception error : represented by . It is the error agent j makes in perceiving paper i ' s ε 𝑖 , 𝑗 quality . While a paper ' s rhetorical value ( see below ) and fit are relatively easy to judge from skimming , quality is more difficult to judge and is initially perceived with error . This perception error disappears after an agent reads the paper . ● Perceived quality : represented by , it denotes the quality of paper i as perceived by 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 agent j at time t , before reading . We assume that the higher a paper ' s citation count the 𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑡 higher its perceived quality , with the premium determined by a parameter , i . e . , α reinforcement strength . Adding all the determinants of a paper ' s perceived quality yields Equation 2 : ( 2 ) 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 = 𝑞 𝑖 + 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 + α × 𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑡 + ε 𝑖 , 𝑗 ● Overall rhetorical value : represented by , denotes the rhetorical usefulness of paper 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 i for agent j at time t . Unlike quality , which has an underlying - quality component , 𝑞 𝑖 rhetorical value is assumed to vary substantially from person to person . For example , a paper taking a side on a debate might be rhetorically useful to those on the same side but not on the other . For heterogeneous agent j , paper i has an initial person - specific rhetorical value . For homogenous agents , . Perceiving the rhetorical value 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 = 𝑟 𝑖 does not require a careful reading so we include a perception error . We assume that rhetorical value increases with perceived quality as in Equation 3 : 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 ( 3 ) 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 | 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 = 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 + β × 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 The parameter determines the strength of the reinforcement process of . β 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 Note , if the agent has not read the paper , her is affected by the perception error in 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 the perceived quality , as shown in Equations 2 . If the agent has read the paper closely , the perception error in perceived quality disappears , and the rhetorical value becomes ) ( 4 ) 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 | 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 = 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 + β × ( 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 − ε 𝑖 , 𝑗 A crucial question is how quality and rhetorical values are distributed , and parameter values are initialized . We ground the distributions using expert ratings from peer review . Focusing on the prominent ICML conference 3 , the reviewing platform OpenReview . net provides ratings of submitted papers . The ratings averaged across a paper ' s reviewers follow an approximately normal distribution . No papers received maximum points or 0 . Assuming that only papers that score in the top 20 - 30 % are accepted ( published ) leads to a long - tail distribution of ratings of published papers 4 . Similarly , team performance in large - scale real - world data exhibits a long - tail distribution rather than a normal distribution ( Bradley & Aguinis , 2022 ) . We thus use a beta distribution for both quality and initial rhetorical value . Parameter w β ( 1 , 𝑤 ) determines the fatness of the distribution ' s tail , which we set at = 6 as it best fits the 𝑤 distributions of ratings of 2019 - 2022 submissions to ICML . In Appendix Section 1 . 1 , we test the robustness of our results to different choices of distributions and w ' s and find that they are qualitatively consistent with the main choices . Turning rhetorical citing " on " and " off " In what we call the " full " model , agents cite substantively and rhetorically . At each time period t an agent joins the environment . Agents first rank all papers by perceived quality . Then , they 𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 read the m highest perceived - quality papers . After reading the papers , agents observe the papers ' actual quality ( with fit ) in their eyes ( no perception error ) and proceed to the citing stage , 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑗 which occurs in two steps . First , adhering to academic norms , agents substantively draw inspiration from and cite all sufficiently good papers in their eyes where quality . If 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑗 > τ 𝑗 there are any remaining slots in the citing budget n , agents rank all papers on rhetorical value and populate the slots with those with highest ' s . We allow an agent to select the same 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 paper for a substantive and a rhetorical slot . We compare this full model to two null models , where agents cite only substantively , i . e . , according to . The two null models differ on how they treat the case where there are 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑗 insufficient papers of high enough quality to fill the entire citing budget . 4 Note that because our model depends heavily on papers of the highest value , it is not sensitive to the shape of the distribution for low - quality papers . 3 https : / / openreview . net / group ? id = ICML . cc .

Finally , the citation count of each paper is 𝑟 𝑖 , 𝑗 , 𝑡 updated and timestep is advanced by 1 . Measures We operationalized the metrics of community health in the following way . To measure the correlation between citation counts and quality at time step t we used the Pearson 𝑐 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑞 𝑖 correlation coefficient . To measure citation churn at time step t , we used the number of papers cited in time t that were not cited in time t - 1 . Larger values represent more churn . To measure citation inequality at time step t , we utilized the Gini coefficient of citation distribution in time t , computed by dividing the area between the equal cumulative distribution of citations and the actual cumulative distribution of citations by the area under the curve of the equal cumulative distribution . Larger values represent more inequality . Choosing parameter values The empirical evidence on how much researchers read ( " reading budget " ) or how many " relevant " papers there are for a particular project is limited . Tenopir et al . surveyed university scholars in 2012 , and they found the mean of monthly article readings was about 20 ( Tenopir et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , how much researchers cite ( " citing budget " ) is readily measurable . According to Lancho - Barrantes et al . , the average number of references in papers varies between 20 and 50 across fields ( Lancho - Barrantes et al . , 2010 ) . To initialize the models , we set literature size to 600 , reading budget to 120 , citing budget to 40 . We explore other parameter choices below and in the Appendix . The models are run for 1000 timesteps . At each timestep , one agent makes her citing decisions ( i . e . , publishes one paper , and thereby cites several from the literature ) . Then , the citation counts and the quantities that depend on them ( perceived quality and rhetorical value ) are updated for all papers . For simplicity , the newly " published " paper is not added to the literature . Thus , any paper from the literature can accrue at most 1000 citations by the end of the run . The model is equivalent if 1000 different agents publish one paper each or one agent publishes 1000 different papers . 5 . Results We present results from the more realistic heterogeneous agents models , and for completeness report homogeneous agents results in Appendix , Section 2 . Effect of rhetorical citing on three metrics of community health Figure 2 shows the results from the main model specifications . The top row shows how the three metrics of community health – quality - citations correlation ( Panel A ) , citation churn ( Panel B ) , and citation inequality ( Panel C ) – evolve across the 1000 timesteps . The middle row extracts one summary statistic for each curve in the top row and compares them across models . Panel D shows that , at the end of 1000 timesteps , quality and citations are more correlated ( + 0 . 026 ) in the full model than in either of the null models . Panel E shows that churn averaged across the 1000 iterations is 2 . 36 times higher than the null - fixed - reference and 2 . 17 times higher than the null - fixed - threshold models . Panel F shows that after 1000 iterations , the Gini coefficient , measuring citation inequality , is 30 . 8 % lower than both null models . These results support our main Hypotheses 1 , 2 , and 3 . To better understand why rhetorical citing affects the community health metrics in this way , we focus on citations to two groups of papers : " high - quality " ( underlying quality q i in the top 40 ) and " mid - quality " papers ( q i in the top 41 - 150 ) . These groups account for 25 % of our literature ( 600 papers ) but attract approximately 85 % of the citations . We then measure how many and what type of citations ( substantive and rhetorical ) the groups get in the full vs . null models . Substantive citing implies that citations should go to the highest - quality papers . Panels H and I show that for the two null models , that is roughly true , with only about 18 % of citations going to mid - quality papers . This minority of citations is accrued due to perception errors and variability of . In contrast , in the full model ( Panel G ) , the fraction of substantive citations 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 going to the highest quality papers is significantly reduced , and mid - quality papers are more cited , particularly rhetorically . Note that in all models low - quality papers receive very few citations of even the rhetorical kind because their overall rhetorical value is likely low ( e . g . , low quality / citation counts result in low perceived quality ) , even if their underlying rhetorical value to an agent is high . Overall , rhetorical citing thus raises the relative " visibility " of medium - quality papers and results in citations no longer being concentrated on a small , stable set of high - quality papers . Figure 2 . A - C : show how the three metrics of community health ( correlation between quality Q and citation count C , citation churn , and citation inequality ) evolve across the 1000 iterations of the full , null - reference , and null - threshold models . D : compares the quality - citation correlation after 1000 iterations . E : compares citation churn averaged over 1000 iterations . F : compares citation inequality after 1000 iterations . G - I : show the fraction of the reference list ( averaged over 1000 iterations ) taken up by substantive citations to papers in the top 40 of quality , substantive citations to papers in the top 41 - 150 of quality , rhetorical citations to the top 40 - quality papers , and rhetorical citations to top 41 - 150 - quality papers . Note : null models ( Panels H , I ) only have substantive citations . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals , and error bars represent conventional 95 % confidence intervals . Moderating effects of citing budget , reading budget , and literature size Citing budget To understand the role of the citing budget , we fix the reading budget at 120 papers , the literature size at 600 papers , and vary the citing budget from 20 to 100 . Figure 3 shows how the three metrics of community health change . In Panels A and C , at each citing budget the model is run ten times for 1000 timesteps each , and the metric is calculated at the end of each run . For Panel B , the metric is averaged over 1000 timesteps in each run . Figure 3 . Citing budget . How increasing the citing budget from 20→100 affects the correlation between citations and quality ( Panel A ) , churn ( Panel B ) , and citation inequality ( Panel C ) . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Increasing the citing budget from 20 to 100 substantially affects all metrics . In Panel A , the citation - quality correlation increases by 35 . 3 % ( 0 . 68 to 0 . 92 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the full model , 31 . 3 % ( 0 . 67 to 0 . 88 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the null - fixed - reference model , and 35 . 8 % ( 0 . 67 to 0 . 91 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the null - fixed - threshold model . In Panel B , churn increases by 4 . 59 times ( 13 . 12 to 60 . 23 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the full model , 2 . 76 times ( 6 . 46 to 17 . 80 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the null - fixed - reference model , and 3 . 83 times ( 6 . 47 to 24 . 81 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the null - fixed - threshold model . Churn in the full model increases from 2 . 03 times to 3 . 38 times higher than the null - fixed - reference model and from 2 . 03 times to 2 . 43 times higher than the null - fixed - threshold model . In Panel C , citation inequality decreases by 30 . 0 % ( 0 . 70 to 0 . 49 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in the full model and 14 . 6 % ( 0 . 96 to 0 . 82 , p < 0 . 0005 ) in either null model . These results support Hypothesis 5A . Intuitively , increasing the citing budget gives authors more opportunities to cite less elite - quality but still good - quality papers . Reading budget To understand the role of the reading budget , we fix the citing budget at 40 , the literature size at 600 , and vary the reading budget from 50 to 150 . Figure 4 shows how the three metrics of community health change across reading budgets . Figure 4 . Reading budget . How increasing the reading budget from 50→150 affects the correlation between citation and quality ( Panel A ) , churn ( Panel B ) , and citation inequality ( Panel C ) . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Unlike citing budget , increasing the reading budget has weaker and more mixed effects on the metrics . The citation - quality correlation increased very weakly in all models ( Panel A : full model : 0 . 791 to 0 . 798 , p = 0 . 01 , coefficient = 1 . 723e - 05 ; null - fixed - reference model : 0 . 757 to 0 . 779 , p < 0 . 001 , coefficient = 8 . 232e - 05 ; null - fixed - threshold model : 0 . 764 to 0 . 777 , p < 0 . 001 , coefficient = 4 . 704e - 05 ) . Citation churn changed slightly in three models ( Panel B : full model : 25 . 5 to 26 . 9 , p = 0 . 005 , coefficient = 0 . 0041 ; null - fixed - reference model : 8 . 38 to 10 . 89 , p < 0 . 001 , coefficient = 0 . 0097 ; null - fixed - threshold mode : 11 . 38 to 11 . 67 , p = 0 . 938 , coefficient = - 7 . 512e - 05 ) . Citation inequality did not change substantially ( Panel C : full model : 0 . 63 to 0 . 61 , p = 0 . 016 , coefficient = - 8 . 85e - 05 ; null - fixed - reference model : 0 . 923 to 0 . 917 , p < 0 . 001 , coefficient = - 2 . 666e - 05 ; null - fixed - threshold model : 0 . 926 to 0 . 922 , p < 0 . 001 , coefficient = - 1 . 55e - 05 ) . Overall , the reading budget did not have a substantial effect on the three metrics of community health . While it may be epistemically valuable to read more papers , the key constraint on whether those papers get formal recognition in the form of citations is the citing budget . These results support Hypothesis 5B . Literature size To understand the role of literature size , we fix the reading budget at 120 , the citing budget at 40 , and vary the literature size from 200 to 800 . Figure 5 shows how the three metrics of community health change across literature sizes . Figure 5 . Literature size . How increasing the literature size from 200→800 affects the correlation between citation and quality ( Panel A ) , churn ( Panel B ) , and citation inequality ( Panel C ) . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Increasing literature size has substantial but mixed effects on the metrics . When the literature size increases from 200 to 800 , the citation - quality correlation decreases by 22 . 1 % in the full model ( 0 . 95 to 0 . 74 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , 21 . 7 % in the null - fixed - reference model ( 0 . 92 to 0 . 72 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , and 22 . 6 % in the null - fixed - threshold model ( 0 . 93 to 0 . 72 , p < 0 . 0005 ) . Citation churn increases by 26 . 3 % in the full model ( 22 . 52 to 28 . 43 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , 29 . 3 % in the null - fixed - reference model ( 9 . 21 to 11 . 91 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , and 22 . 8 % in the null - fixed - threshold model ( 10 . 16 to 12 . 48 , p < 0 . 0005 ) . Citation inequality increases by 30 . 6 % in the full model ( 0 . 49 to 0 . 64 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , 22 . 1 % in the null - fixed - reference model ( 0 . 77 to 0 . 94 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , and 20 . 5 % in the null - fixed threshold model ( 0 . 78 to 0 . 94 , p < 0 . 0005 ) . These results support Hypothesis 4 . Overall , increasing literature size decreases the correlation between citations and quality , and increases citation churn and inequality . Intuitively , as literature size grows , the fraction of papers read and cited decreases , with both being concentrated on elite - quality pieces . Surprisingly , citation churn increases as well . As the literature size grows , the more high - quality papers ( above the threshold ) there are . Idiosyncratic factors like can make authors substitute 𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑗 one high - quality paper for another . 6 . Discussion This paper used agent - based models to understand the effect of rhetorical citing on scientific communities . We simulated worlds with substantive and rhetorical citing , i . e . , the current world , vs . only substantive citing practices , and measured how turning rhetorical citing " on " and " off " affected three relatively measurable and much - discussed metrics of community health – the correlation between citations and quality , citation churn , and citation inequality . Surprisingly , we found that rhetorical citing increases the degree to which citation counts correlate with a paper ' s quality , increases citation churn , and decreases citation inequality . The proximate explanation for these effects is that rhetorical citing redistributes citations from the few elite - quality papers to a more diverse set . The more fundamental explanation is that when seeking papers to cite rhetorically , researchers select on factors beyond just quality ( which may still be important ) , such as rhetorical value . Furthermore , increasing the length of reference lists ( " citing budgets " ) , usually seen as a problem , increased churn , citation - quality correlation , and decreased citation inequality . Increasing the reading budget , usually encouraged , had little effect on three metrics . Lastly , increasing the literature size had mixed effects , increasing churn , decreasing citation - quality correlation , and increasing inequality . These additional results further show the value of modeling how intuitive recommendations from the scientific community may have underappreciated consequences . Models such as ours necessitate many simplifications and scope conditions , which we believe are fruitful directions for future research . First and foremost , the three metrics of community health we focus on are not exhaustive or unambiguous in interpretation . While it is relatively unambiguous that a higher citation - quality correlation is better for science than a lower one , the optimal levels of churn and inequality are more ambiguous , although the current literature raises concerns that the current levels are higher than optimal ( Chu and Evans 2021 ; Nielsen and Andersen 2021 ) . If one takes the conservative view that only one of our three metrics has an unambiguous interpretation , then a measured conclusion of our results is that rhetorical citing has some effects that are plausibly positive . However , other potential metrics , like the amount of misinformation in the literature or misallocation of rewards , were not included ( West & Bergstrom , 2021 ) . We hope our work stimulates effort to model more dimensions of community health to better capture the overall effects of a different world . Second , we assumed that the agents and the types of papers they produce remain fixed across the different worlds . In other words , we did not account for how agents might change their behavior in response to the types of citation practices that exist in a community . For example , in a world with only substantive citing , agents may seek to produce papers of high quality rather than high rhetorical value . Note that while incentives that induce papers of high quality only may appear to be ideal , such a world may have the same concerns as the substantive - citing worlds this paper explored . Third , as noted previously , our models are designed to capture reading and citing dynamics in the short - to - medium term . In the long - term , it is important to take into account the scientific obsolescence of older works , the decline in the reinforcing strength of previous citations , the addition of newly published papers , and other signals of quality , e . g . , journal impact factor . 7 . Conclusion Citing papers for reasons other than to acknowledge their influence ( " rhetorical citing " ) is widely discouraged because it is assumed to harm scientific communities . The assumption is intuitive and supported by numerous examples of harmful effects ( Greenberg , 2009 ; Letrud & Hernes , 2019 ; Rekdal , 2014 ; De Vries et al . , 2018 ) . It is thus very tempting to envision the counterfactual world with only substantive citing practices optimistically . The first contribution of the paper is to model that counterfactual world realistically , and compare it to the present . The comparison revealed that rhetorical citing changes , and arguably improves , three aspects of scientific community health . By redistributing citations from a stable set of elite - quality papers to a broader set , rhetorical citing increases the extent to which citations measure quality and increases dynamism in scientific literatures . While previous work has pointed to the volume of research as a driver of stagnation ( Chu & Evans , 2021 ) , our work reveals that some seemingly " bad " practices in science , like citing papers without being influenced by them , can help mitigate it . This finding points to a broader conclusion – citations are the outcome of a longer process , driven by how researchers search for and read papers . Consequently , attempts to improve only the last part of this citing process without improving the earlier steps may be of limited utility and may even have unintended consequences . The study did not aspire to measure the total effect of rhetorical citing . Such an analysis would require taking into account many more direct and indirect effects , such as misinformation in the literature ( Cobb et al . , 2023 ; West & Bergstrom , 2021 ) . Thus , the paper does not endorse rhetorical citing , but only argues that it is not a priori obvious whether the scientific community is better off without it . More broadly , the study suggests that when considering policies to fix a particular dysfunction in research , it is important to account for the broad set of incentives and cognitive constraints within which researchers operate . Performing the comparison above necessitated the development of a behavioral model of citing , in which researchers are cognitively constrained and cite for both substantive and rhetorical reasons . Such a synthetic model of citing has proven to be an elusive goal for decades of scientometrics and information science literature ( Bornmann & Daniel , 2008 ; Cronin , 1981 ) , with limited progress to this day . The paper ' s second contribution is to offer one such synthetic model , drawing on the rich empirical literature on how researchers search for , read , and cite papers . 8 . References Allen , B .

Robustness checks The Main paper considered several moderation variables , e . g . , literature size . Here , as we vary various parameters to test for robustness , we also parameter - sweep arguably the most important and policy - relevant moderator – the citing budget . As we change the focal parameters , we show how the results vary as the citing budget goes from 20 to 100 and includes more rhetorical citations . 1 . 1 . Varying quality and initial rhetorical value distributions In the Main model , we assumed long - tail distributions for quality and initial rhetorical value . The tail ' s fatness may have a significant effect on three metrics of community health . Here , we examine the robustness of our principal conclusions using different value distributions . In the Main model we used ( 1 , w ) for distributions of quality and rhetorical value . Parameter w β determines the fatness of the distribution ' s tail , which we set w at 6 . We vary it to 4 and 8 to see how the results will change with more / fewer high - value papers , respectively . In addition , we consider a normal distribution N ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 1 ) . All distributions are shown in Figure S1 . Figure S1 . Value distributions . We tested three additional distributions for quality and initial rhetorical value : more high - value papers ( 1 , 4 ) , fewer high - value papers ( 1 , 8 ) , and values β β following a Gaussian distribution N ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 1 ) among papers . The presented model in the Main paper uses a Beta distribution ( 1 , 6 ) of values with moderate numbers of high - value ones . β More high - value papers Using a distribution with more papers of high quality and rhetorical value ( w = 4 ) , we find that rhetorical citing still improves the three metrics of health , consistent with the Main results . Figure S2 plots how the metrics for the full and two null models change across different citing budgets . The result for each citing budget is the measurement after a 1000 - time - step simulation , averaged by ten random seeds . Figure S2 . The results with more high - value papers ( 1 , 4 ) . Shaded regions represent β bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Fewer high - value papers Similarly to the above , using a distribution with fewer papers of high quality and rhetorical value ( w = 8 ) , we find that rhetorical citing still improves the three metrics of health , consistent with the Main results . Figure S3 . The results with fewer high - value papers ( 1 , 8 ) . Shaded regions represent β bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Normal distribution of values Next , we consider the case where quality and rhetorical value are distributed normally . The full model ( with rhetorical citing ) improves the metrics relative to the null models , especially for higher citing budgets . Figure S4 . The results under a normal distribution of values N ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 1 ) . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . 1 . 2 . Varying distributions of threshold In the Main results , we sampled adoption thresholds for agents from a uniform distribution on [ 0 , 1 ] . Here , we instead use a truncated normal distribution N ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 2 ) within the range [ 0 , 1 ] . Figure S5 shows that rhetorical citing improves the three metrics , consistent with the Main results . Figure S5 .

Varying size of perception error In the Main result , perception error was distributed Normal ( 0 , 0 . 05 ) . Here , we consider how the results change when the standard deviation is lowered to 0 . 02 or raised to 0 . 1 . Higher noise Figure S6 shows that rhetorical citing improves the three metrics , consistent with the Main results . Figure S6 . Three metrics of community health with higher perception noise , Normal ( 0 , 0 . 1 ) . Fit and perception errors can vary a paper’s quality from 0 . 5 to a random number in [ 0 . 1 , 0 . 9 ] . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Lower noise Figure S7 shows that rhetorical citing increases the correlation ( left panel ) , churn ( middle panel ) , and decreases citation inequality ( right panel ) , consistent with the Main results . Figure S7 . Three metrics of community health with lower perception noise , Normal ( 0 , 0 . 02 ) . Fit and perception errors can vary a paper’s quality from 0 . 5 to a random number in appx . [ 0 . 35 , 0 . 65 ] . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . 1 . 4 Varying distribution of fit In the Main result , we sampled fit for agents from a uniform distribution on [ - 0 . 1 , 0 . 1 ] . Here , we consider how the results change when the range of the distribution is increased to [ - 0 . 2 , 0 . 2 ] or decreased to [ - 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 ] . Less varied fit Figure S8 shows that rhetorical citing improves the three metrics , consistent with the Main results . Figure S8 . Three metrics of community health with a less varied fit , Uniform ( - 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 ) . Fit and perception errors can vary a paper’s quality from 0 . 5 to a random number in [ 0 . 3 , 0 . 7 ] . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . More varied fit Figure S9 shows that rhetorical citing improves churn ( the middle panel ) and citation inequality ( the right panel ) . However , the citation - quality correlation changes little between the full and null models . The intuition behind this result is that with a more varied fit , existing perceived quality of papers does not much affect whether researchers cite them subsequently as varied fits can significantly raise or lower the quality in readers ' eyes . Hence , the lock - in effect observed in the null models in our Main results is reduced . In effect , rhetorical citing has similar but much stronger effects on the community health metrics as adding substantial person - specific purposes to the citing process . Figure S9 . Three metrics of community health with a more varied fit , Uniform ( - 0 . 2 , 0 . 2 ) . Fit and perception errors can vary a paper’s quality from 0 . 5 to a random number in [ 0 . 15 , 0 . 85 ] . Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . 1 . 5 Varying reinforcement strengths Varing α The parameter measures how a paper ' s citation count affects perceptions of its quality , with α . Note that because the maximum citation count is 1000 , the maximum effect of α = 0 . 001 citations on perceived quality is 0 . 001 * 1000 = 1 , which equals the maximum underlying quality and maximum underlying rhetorical value . Here , we consider the case ( maximum α = 0 . 002 citation premium = 2 ) and ( citations have no impact on perceived quality ) . α = 0 Figure S10 shows that the full model outperforms the two null models in the three metrics if readers do not rely on citations to perceive quality . In contrast , Figure S11 shows that under a higher reinforcement strength , the full model outperforms the two null models on churn and inequality , but is similar on correlation . Greater reinforcement increases the concentration of substantive citations among elite - quality papers , and because perceived quality is a component of rhetorical value , increases rhetorical citations on them as well , diminishing the differences between the models . Figure S10 . Three metrics under zero reinforcing strength ( ) . Shaded regions α = 0 represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Figure S11 . Three metrics under a higher reinforcing strength ( . 002 ) . Shaded α = 0 regions represent bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals . Varing β The parameter quantifies how a paper ' s perceived quality affects its rhetorical value , with β in the Main model . Here we compare the Main model with = 0 , where rhetorical β = 0 . 3 β value does not depend on perceived quality at all , and = 1 , where in determining rhetorical β value agents place equal weight on how rhetorically useful the paper is to their argument and its perceived quality . Note that because the null models do not have rhetorical citing , we do not include them in this analysis . Figure S11 shows that the full model with = 0 has the highest citation churn and the β lowest citation inequality . The full model with = 1 has the lowest churn and highest inequality . β Interestingly , the model with the intermediate = 0 . 3 value that we use in Main has the highest β citations - quality correlation . If agents rely on perceived quality very heavily , then the model comes close to the null models without rhetorical citing , lowering the correlation as is observed in the null models . On the other hand , if agents do not rely on perceived quality at all , then the underlying rhetorical value becomes the only driving factor in citing and even low - quality papers receive citations . Thus , very high and very low reinforcement induce lower citations - quality correlations by increasing citing of the upper and lower ends of the quality distribution , respectively . Figure S11 .

Model with homogeneous agents In contrast to the heterogeneous agent models presented in Main , homogeneous agents perceive quality identically ( there is no fit i , j ) , perceive rhetorical value identically , and have the same threshold for adoption 0 . 5 . We initialize models with homogeneous agents the same way as with heterogeneous ones : literature size = 600 , reading budget = 120 , citing budget = 40 , and timesteps = 1000 . Figure S12 shows the citation distribution across paper quality . After 1000 iterations , the distribution is nearly bimodal with some papers having 0 citations and some 1000 . Given that citation distributions in practice are never bimodal , we do not believe such a simple model is sufficiently realistic . For completeness , we present all three community health metrics for the three versions of this model ( Full , Null - reference , Null - threshold ) in Figure S13 , but do not interpret it further .
