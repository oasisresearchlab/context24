McDonnell Foundation Scholar Award Abstract Analogical reasoning , or the ability to find correspondences between entities based on shared relationships , supports knowledge acquisition . As such , the development of this ability during childhood is thought to promote learning . Here , we sought to better un - derstand the mechanisms by which analogical reasoning about semantic relations im - proves over childhood and adolescence ( e . g . chalk is to chalkboard as pen is to… ? ) . We hypothesized that age - related differences would manifest as differences in the brain regions associated with one or more of the following cognitive functions : ( 1 ) controlled semantic retrieval , or the ability to retrieve task - relevant semantic associations ; ( 2 ) re - sponse control , or the ability to override the tendency to respond to a salient distractor ; and / or ( 3 ) relational integration , or the ability to consider jointly two mental relations . In order to test these hypotheses , we analyzed patterns of fMRI activation during per - formance of a pictorial propositional analogy task across 95 typically developing chil - dren between the ages of 6 and 18 years old . Despite large age - related differences in task performance , particularly over ages 6 – 10 but through to around age 14 , partici - pants across the whole age range recruited a common network of frontal , parietal and temporal regions . However , activation in a brain region that has been implicated in controlled semantic retrieval – left anterior prefrontal cortex ( BA 47 / 45 ) – was posi - tively correlated with age , and also with performance after controlling for age . This finding indicates that improved performance over middle childhood and early adoles - cence on this analogical reasoning task is driven largely by improvements in the ability to selectively retrieve task - relevant semantic relationships .

Developmental Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 2 of 11 | WHITAKER ET Al . Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 , 2003 ) , is central to learning and thought ( Hofstadter & Sander , 2012 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ; Namy & Gentner , 2002 ) . Across diverse real - world environments , analogies are employed to explain new information ( Dunbar & Blanchette , 2001 ) , to solve problems ( Gick & Holyoak , 1980 , 1983 ) , and to facilitate the learning of new information in educational settings ( Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ; Richland & McDonough , 2010 ; Vendetti , Matlen , Richland , & Bunge , 2015 ) . Given the ubiquitous use of analogies in understanding new domains , reasoning by analogy is widely considered to be an import - ant tool underlying children’s acquisition of knowledge ( Gentner , 1988 ; Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ; Goswami , 1996 ; Halford , 1992 ; Halford , Wilson , & Phillips , 1998 ; Kotosvky & Gentner , 1996 ) . Research related to the development of analogical reasoning ability has yielded two major behavioral findings . First , contrary to findings from earlier research on the development of analogical reasoning ( e . g . Sternberg & Nigro , 1980 ) , young children can in some cases solve analogy problems ( e . g . Holyoak , Junn , & Billman , 1984 ) . Second , content knowledge is an important factor in predicting one’s ability to use analogies effectively ( Goswami & Brown , 1990 ; Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ) . It is important to note , however , that children are still prone to making certain types of errors during analogical reasoning . For example , one study showed that 3 - to 5 - year olds will make object - matching errors , choosing an incorrect response based on perceptual similarity ( Gentner & Medina , 1998 ) . Another showed that children up to 11 years of age are likely to select items in a propositional anal - ogy task solely on the basis of semantic associations ( Sternberg & Nigro , 1980 ) . These patterns of results indicate that there is still much room for improvement after children are first able to make relational matches , and that in order to solve analogies they must learn to look beyond the fact that two items are related and examine how they are related . The ability to select the appropriate semantic relation , termed controlled semantic retrieval , is an important mechanism for solving semantic analogy problems . This cognitive process allows the reasoner to select specifically analogous semantic associations in the face of other , more general , semantic associations ( Bunge , Wendelken , Badre , & Wagner , 2005 ; Krawczyk et al . , 2010 ) . Beyond improvements in domain - specific knowledge and con - trolled semantic retrieval , several other mechanisms have been pro - posed to underlie the development of analogical reasoning ability , including the ability to maintain multiple mental representations in working memory and integrate distinct mental relations ( e . g . Halford , Wilson , & Phillips , 1998 ; Holyoak & Kroger , 1995 ) and to suppress interference from irrelevant information ( e . g . Richland , Morrison , & Holyoak , 2006 ; Morrison , Doumas , & Richland , 2011 ) . Thus , although there is wide consensus on the pervasive role of analogical reasoning in children’s acquisition and use of knowledge , several domain - general cognitive processes – working memory , interference suppression , and relational integration – have also been shown to contribute to rea - soning ability ( Cho , Holyoak , & Cannon , 2007 ) , one or more of which could be the key driver ( s ) of the development of this high - level cogni - tive ability . There has been much previous work demonstrating a shift from matching items based on perceptual to more abstract features occur - ring between the ages of 4 and 6 years ( e . g . Rattermann & Gentner , 1998 ) , but much less work examining developmental changes beyond age 6 years . Therefore , we wanted to investigate how the number of semantic versus perceptual errors changes throughout childhood . Beyond choosing a response based on semantic versus purely per - ceptual features , we were also interested in identifying when children would be able to reliably choose items that matched based on a spe - cific semantic association analogous to that shared between the A and B items . Preliminary fMRI data from our laboratory ( Wright , Matlen , Baym , Ferrer , & Bunge , 2008 ) pointed to age - related differences in analogi - cal reasoning between 6 – 13 - year - olds ( N = 16 ) and 19 – 26 - year - olds ( N = 17 ) , but this earlier work was limited by a small sample size , a child group spanning a broad age range , and a task design wherein analogy trials either contained a semantic or a perceptual lure , but not both . In the current study , we sought to collect data from a much larger pediat - ric sample , use an up - to - date analytic approach , including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons , and directly pit the influence of semantic and perceptual lures against each other on each analogy trial . The current study investigated the neural correlates of analogical reasoning ability in over 130 children aged 6 to 18 years . Participants solved two types of trials : ( 1 ) semantic match , in which they had to choose a response that was semantically related to the target item ; and ( 2 ) propositional analogy ( i . e . A : B : : C : ? ) , in which they had to choose a response that was semantically similar to an item ( C term ) in an analo - gous fashion to a semantic relation displayed between two other items ( A and B terms ) . On each analogy trial , participants had to choose the correct response out of four possible choices . Responses for analogy trials consisted of the correct response ( i . e . the answer choice that completes the analogy ) , a perceptual lure ( i . e . an item that was per - ceptually similar to the C term ) , a semantic lure ( i . e . an item that was semantically related to the C term , but did not complete the analogy ) , and a lure that was unrelated both perceptually and semantically . Our aims in this study were twofold . First , given that prior develop - mental research on analogical reasoning focused largely on improve - ments in early childhood ( ~ ages 4 – 6 ) , we sought to determine whether improvements would also be observed later in childhood , and poten - tially even in adolescence . In addition to testing for age differences in overall accuracy , we sought to test for age differences in the types of errors participants made , namely in the selection of semantic , percep - tual , or unrelated distractors . Second , we sought to pinpoint the key neurocognitive mechanism ( s ) that underlie improvements in analogical reasoning over childhood . In prior adult fMRI research using a difficult verbal propositional analogy task ( e . g . ‘agile : acrobat : : eloquent : orator ? ’ yes / no ) , we had dissociated the roles of three subregions within lateral prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) by manipulating task difficulty in several ways ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ) . We found that left anterior inferior prefrontal cor - tex ( aLIPC ; ~ BA 45 / 47 ) was sensitive to a manipulation of seman - tic relatedness between the A and B words ; it was engaged more strongly when it was necessary to retrieve a relation among more | 3 of 11 WHITAKER ET Al . weakly associated terms than among strongly associated ones , con - sistent with prior work showing that this region is associated with effortful , or controlled , semantic memory retrieval ( e . g . Wagner , Paré - Blagoev , Clark , & Poldrack , 2001 ) . Both left aLIPC and right dorsolateral PFC ( DLPFC ; ~ BA 9 ) – a region implicated in cognitive control ( e . g . Miller & Cohen , 2001 ; Stuss & Knight , 2012 ) – were engaged more strongly when it was necessary to reject an invalid analogy involving mismatched pairs of semantic associates ( e . g . ‘vari - able : equation : clay : sculpture ? ’ ) than to accept a valid one . Finally , left aLIPC and left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex ( RLPFC ; ~ BA 10 ) – a region that had been hypothesized to play a role in the ability to jointly consider two mental relations ( e . g . Christoff et al . , 2001 ; Kroger et al . , 2002 ) – were engaged more strongly when participants were asked to consider whether two word pairs formed a valid anal - ogy than when they were asked to conduct a semantic relatedness judgment on one of the two word pairs . In summary , then , we found that several PFC regions contributed in different ways to analogi - cal reasoning in adults . Left aLIPC was sensitive to the semantic relatedness manipulation , implicating it in the process of retrieving semantic relations among words in a pair . Neither RLPFC nor DLPFC was sensitive to this manipulation , consistent with their purported involvement in post - retrieval , domain - independent processes such as relational integration ( Krawczyk , 2012 ) and response selection ( Aron , Robbins , & Poldrack , 2014 ) . Another fMRI study of analogical reasoning in young adults , using a different paradigm , independently manipulated demands for inter - ference resolution and relational integration ( Cho et al . , 2010 ) . In this study , bilateral DLPFC and posterior left inferior prefrontal cortex ( pLIPC ) , as well as right aLIPC , were sensitive to the need to ignore distracting information ; by contrast , RLPFC was specifically sensitive to the need to integrate multiple relations . Thus , consistent with our prior work , multiple PFC regions are recruited during analogical rea - soning , and their roles are dissociable . Here , we sought to test whether improvements in analogical rea - soning over ages 6 – 18 years were related to changes in one or more of these PFC regions . If age - related changes over this age range are driven in large part by an improved ability to access and select task - relevant semantic knowledge ( e . g . Gentner & Ratterman , 1991 ) , then we would expect age - related improvements in analogical reasoning to be most closely linked to changes in left aLIPC , a region that has been implicated in controlled semantic retrieval , or the process of retriev - ing task - relevant semantic relations while ignoring task - irrelevant ones ( e . g . Badre , Poldrack , Paré - Blagoev , Insler , & Wagner , 2005 ; Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Poldrack et al . , 1999 ; Souza , Donohue , & Bunge , 2009 ; Wagner et al . , 2001 ) . Left aLIPC has , beyond its role in selecting among competing semantic relations , been implicated more gener - ally in the ability to resolve conflict among conflicting working mem - ory representations ( e . g . Novick , Kan , Trueswell , & Thompson - Schill , 2009 ; Thompson - Schill et al . , 2002 ) . In the context of this task , if we were to find that age - related improvements in analogical reasoning were linked primarily to left aLIPC , we would infer that they are driven largely by an improved ability to retrieve and / or select task - relevant semantic relations . By contrast , if age - related changes over the age range inves - tigated in this study are driven largely by an improved ability to inhibit impulsive responses to distractors ( e . g . Richland et al . , 2006 ; Morrison et al . , 2011 ) , then we would expect to find age - related improvements associated with activation in PFC regions implicated in voluntary control over action ( e . g . Passingham , 1995 ) . One such region is right VLPFC ( both posterior and anterior inferior PFC ; BA 44 ; 45 , 47 ) , which has been strongly linked to response inhibition ( aLIPC as well as pLIPC ; for a review , see Aron et al . , 2014 ) . Other candidate regions include bilateral DLPFC and pLIPC , which have been implicated more broadly in goal - directed behavior – including but not limited to selection among competing responses on the basis of task rules ( e . g . see Bunge , 2004 ) . Thus , if we were to find that age - related improvements in analogical reasoning were linked primarily to right VLPFC , left pLIPC , and / or DLPFC , we would infer that they are driven largely by improvements in the ability to select between competing responses , overriding the tendency to respond to a salient distractor ( Cho et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , if age - related changes in analogical reasoning over ages 6 – 18 years are driven by improvements in a domain - general capacity for relational thinking ( e . g . Halford et al . , 1998 ; Dumontheil , 2014 ) , we would predict age - related improvements associated with activation in RLPFC . This region and the inferior parietal lobule ( IPL ) have been implicated in relational integration across a range of tasks ( for a review , see Vendetti & Bunge , 2014 ) . RLPFC and IPL have been hypothe - sized to play a domain - general role in relational thinking , as they are engaged when encoding both semantic and visuospatial relations ( e . g . Wendelken , Chun , & Bunge , 2012 ) . In addition , the collective results of several studies have shown that developmental improvements in non - semantic relational reasoning can be linked strongly to changes in the activation and functional connectivity of RLPFC and IPL ( Dumontheil et al . , 2010 ; Wendelken , O’Hare , Whitaker , Ferrer , & Bunge , 2011 ; Wendelken , Ferrer , Whitaker , & Bunge , 2016 ) . Thus , if we were to find that age - related improvements in analogical reasoning were linked pri - marily to these regions , we would infer that they are driven largely by improvements in relational thinking . Notably , although these hypotheses are not mutually exclu - sive – that is , developmental improvements in analogical reasoning could be the result of changes in multiple underlying neurocognitive processes , given that analogical reasoning draws on multiple lower - level cognitive functions ( e . g . Krawczyk , 2012 ) – each prediction is associated with a spatially dissociable pattern of brain activation . Our preliminary developmental fMRI study of analogical reasoning ( Wright et al . , 2008 ) pointed to age - related changes in the activa - tion of a number of the brain regions outlined above , but – given its small sample size and the strong correlation between age and task performance – could not distinguish between brain regions whose activation is associated with task performance and those that merely become more active with age while performing the task . In the cur - rent study , we sought to identify the key drivers of age - related and individual differences in analogical reasoning over ages 6 to 18 years : improvements in controlled semantic memory retrieval , response inhibition , and / or relational integration . 4 of 11 | WHITAKER ET Al . 2 | METHODS 2 . 1 | Participants This study included 138 typically developing individuals ( 81 males ; 1234 right - handed ) from the Neurodevelopment of Reasoning Ability ( NORA ) study , a project designed to examine the behavioral and neu - ral factors that underlie changes in reasoning ability through childhood and adolescence . Analyses of the development of functional speciali - zation and white matter microstructure using data from the NORA cohort have previously been published ( Ferrer et al . , 2013 ; Wendelken et al . , 2011 ) . The age range was 6 . 2 to 18 . 9 years ( M = 11 . 0 , SD = 3 . 6 ) . Participants were excluded if they had a neurological impairment , psy - chiatric illness , or a history of learning disability and / or developmental delay . Participants’ fMRI data were included if at least two of four runs of usable fMRI data . Each run was considered usable if it covered the whole brain and had a root mean square translational movement of less than 1 mm . All participants and their parents gave their informed assent ( under 12 years of age ) or consent ( aged 12 or older ) to participate in the study , which was approved by the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California at Berkeley . 2 . 2 | Study design 2 . 2 . 1 | Experimental task The task included two conditions : analogy and semantic match prob - lems . The task was based on a test from the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test , 2nd edition ( KBIT - 2 ) , designed for use with children . Our labora - tory designed the analogy and semantic trials using Adobe Photoshop , and made use of line drawings from ‘The Big Box of Art : 1 Million’ . All stimuli were pictures of common objects known to young children , as judged by age - of - acquisition psycholinguistic norms for the words that they depicted ( Gilhooly & Logie , 1980 ) . On analogy trials ( Figure 1a ) , participants were shown an image containing an incomplete propositional analogy ( i . e . A : B : : C : ? ) above a row of four items . Participants were asked to indicate with a button press which of the four possible answers best completed the array ( e . g . dress is to closet as milk carton is to refrigerator ) . Specifically , participants were asked to choose which of the bottom pictures best fills in the question mark . They were told that it should go with the middle picture ( e . g . milk carton ) in the same way that the top two pictures go together ( i . e . in the same way that the dress goes with the closet ) . They were then told that , ‘there may be other pictures that you think go with the C term ( e . g . the milk carton ) , but you should choose the picture that goes with the milk carton in the same way that the dress goes with the closet’ . Each trial contained a perceptual lure ; for example , in Figure 1a , the clock has a similar shape and color to the milk carton . In addition , analogy trials had a semantic lure that did not complete the analogy ; in Figure 1a , the cow represented the semantic lure . Finally , the response choices contained an unrelated lure that was neither perceptually nor semantically related to the terms in the analogy problem . On semantic match trials ( Figure 1b ) , participants saw one item ( e . g . notepad ) presented above a row of four items . Participants were asked to indicate with a button press which of four possible answers ‘went best with it’ ( e . g . pen ) . Response choices on semantic trials included the correct semantic associate , a perceptual lure ( e . g . a shower curtain with a similar shape and color to the notepad ) , and two perceptually and semantically unrelated lures . The experimenter reinforced the rule by stating the correct choice ( i . e . the semantic association ) for each example after the participant had responded . FIGURE 1 ( a ) Analogy Task . Participants indicated which of the four choices was associated with an item in analogous fashion to the relation shared between the top two items . In this example , the refrigerator is associated with the milk carton ( i . e . , refrigerator stores the milk carton ) in an analogous way to the dress and the closet items . On each trial , a semantic lure ( e . g . , cow ) , a perceptual lure ( e . g . , clock ) , and an unrelated lure ( e . g . , tennis racket ) were included . Thus , participants’ correct choice was based on understanding the correct semantic association and disregarding irrelevant semantic or perceptual information . ( b ) Semantic matching task . Participants decide which of the four choices share a semantic relationship with a target object . In this example , the pen is used to write on the notepad , and thus is the item with the strongest semantic association . On each semantic trial , a perceptual lure ( e . g . , a shower curtain ) as well as two unrelated lures were included . Thus , participants had to understand that the correct choice was based on semantic , rather than just perceptual , associations ( a ) ( b ) | 5 of 11 WHITAKER ET Al . 2 . 3 | Data acquisition 2 . 3 . 1 | Training procedure On an initial visit to the laboratory , prior to the day of scanning , chil - dren between ages 6 and 12 years undertook a mock scan designed to minimize movement and participant anxiety during the MRI scan . The mock scan was conducted in a decommissioned Varian MRI scanner , which did not have an active magnetic field , but accurately recreated the experience of lying in an MRI scanner . Participants wore head - phones and listened to recorded sounds of MRI acquisition sequences , and watched a cartoon movie on a mirror system . The researcher reminded children to stay still when they moved their arms or legs , and a head - tracker was used to provide feedback when the partici - pant moved their head more than 2 mm . This mock scan lasted about 15 minutes . On the day of the MRI scan , a research assistant explained the task outside the scanner . Participants practiced five semantic and five analogy questions . If they answered a problem incorrectly , the researcher corrected them and the task was explained again . Once in the scanner , participants practiced using the button box to respond to the same practice questions before the scan acquisition . During the fMRI scan , stimulus presentation and button - press responses were collected using the Presentation psychological experi - mentation software ( Neurobehavioral Systems ) . Semantic and analogy trials were presented in a random order in a fast event - related design . Each of the four task runs consisted of 10 semantic and 10 analogy trials and lasted 4 minutes . Participants were given up to 10 s to answer each question ; once they answered , a fixation cross appeared and stayed on the screen until the end of the 10 - s interval . Children were encouraged to respond as soon as they knew the answer , but were reminded that picking the right answer was more important than responding quickly . 2 . 3 . 2 | MRI data acquisition Brain imaging data were collected at UC Berkeley on a 3 - T Siemens Trio TIM MR scanner using a 12 - channel head coil with a maximum gradient strength of 40mT / m . Functional MRI data of the whole brain was acquired using echo - planar imaging ( TR = 2000 ms ; TE = 25 ms ; 2 . 0 × 1 . 8 × 3 . 0 mm voxels ; 33 slices oriented along the anterior commis - sure – posterior commissure axis ; no interslice gap ; flip angle = 90° ; field of view = 230 mm ; 120 volumes per run ) . Parallel acquisition ( GRAPPA ) was used with an acceleration factor of 2 , and a gradient - echo echo - planar pulse Prospective Acquisition Correction ( 3D - PACE ) sequence was used to minimize motion artifacts by prospectively adjusting scan parameters throughout a run on the basis of real - time assessment of head motion ( Siemens Medical Solutions ; Thesen , Heid , Mueller , & Schad , 2000 ) . A T1 - weighted image was also acquired in each participant for image regis - tration ( MPRAGE ; TR = 2300 ms ; TE = 2 . 98 ms ; 1 mm 3 isotropic voxels ) . 2 . 3 . 3 | FMRI pre - processing FMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT ( FMRI Expert Analysis Tool ) Version 6 . 00 , part of FSL ( FMRIB’s Software Library , www . fmrib . ox . ac . uk / fsl ) . The following pre - statistics processing was applied : motion correction using MCFLIRT ( Jenkinson , Bannister , Brady , & Smith , 2002 ) ; slice - timing correction using Fourier - space time - series phase - shifting ; non - brain removal using BET ( Smith et al . , 2004 ) ; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5 mm ; grand - mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor ; high - pass temporal filtering ( Gaussian - weighted least - squares straight line fitting , with sigma = 50 . 0 s ) . Runs were excluded at this stage if the root mean square translational movement between volume acquisitions was greater than 1 mm ( 83 runs excluded out of a possible 524 ; 16 % ) . We chose this liberal inclu - sion criterion a priori in order to minimize data loss , while also ensuring that data quality was not excessively degraded ( Galván , Leijenhorst , & McGlennan , 2012 ) . If a participant did not have useable data for at least two of the four runs , they were excluded from further analy - ses ( 35 participants excluded ; 25 % ) , including 20 runs that were not collected because the participant asked to end the acquisition early ( 4 % ) . A further 8 participants ( 6 % ) had miscellaneous errors in their processing pipeline which meant they could not be included in group analyses . The final neuroimaging sample included 95 participants ( age range : 6 . 3 to 18 . 9 years , M = 11 . 7 , SD = 3 . 5 ) . 2 . 4 | Statistical analyses 2 . 4 . 1 | Behavioral analyses We analyzed participants’ accuracy and response times ( RTs ) on anal - ogy and semantic trials . We tested the following hypotheses using paired t - tests : participants would be more accurate and faster on semantic than on analogy trials , and they would make more semantic errors than perceptual errors and more perceptual errors than unre - lated errors . We fitted linear and quadratic models to predict , based on their age , participants’ accuracy , RTs on correct trials , and number of seman - tic , perceptual and unrelated lure errors . The best - fitting model was selected according to the adjusted R 2 values of the models . We also investigated whether analogy accuracy explained the relationship between age and semantic accuracy , or whether semantic accuracy explained the relationship between age and analogy accuracy . All behavioral analyses were two - tailed and assessed at α = . 05 . Although we do not correct for multiple comparisons , as the hypothe - ses were non - independent , we note that the Bonferroni correction for all tests described above is . 003 ( . 05 / 16 ) . 2 . 4 . 2 | Individual subject analyses Time - series statistical analyses for individual runs were carried out using FILM with local autocorrelation correction ( Woolrich et al . , 2009 ) . Although runs with large amounts of motion had been excluded from the analysis , there remained the possibility that motion could corrupt the fMRI signal . In order to alleviate this concern , six motion regressors ( indexing translation and rotation in the x - , y - and z - dimensions for each 2 - s TR ) were included in the analysis as covariates 6 of 11 | WHITAKER ET Al . of no interest , along with time - series data representing signal in white matter , cerebrospinal fluid , and areas outside the brain . Regressors representing correct trials and the four types of error trials ( semantic , perceptual , unrelated distractor , and omission ) were modeled sepa - rately as events starting when the question appeared on the screen and ending at the time the subject answered the question ( or when the question disappears in the case of omitted responses ) . Analogy and semantic trials and their associated errors were modeled sepa - rately , yielding up to nine task regressors . The temporal derivative of these modeled events was also included . 2 . 4 . 3 | Group fMRI statistics Scanning runs that passed our motion criterion were combined for each participant using a fixed - effects model , after which group - level analyses were performed using a random - effects model ( Beckmann , Jenkinson , & Smith , 2003 ; Woolrich , Behrens , Beckmann , Jenkinson & Smith , 2004 ; Woolrich , 2008 ) . For the fixed - effects analyses , the contrasts of correct semantic events > fixation , correct analogy events > fixation and correct analogy events > correct semantic events were averaged over each participant’s completed runs . First , we quantified mean activation across all participants on each of three whole - brain contrasts : analogy > fixation , semantic > fixation , and analogy > semantic . We then used these results to gen - erate a liberal mask of regions that were not deactivated by either the semantic or the analogy tasks relative to fixation , by excluding regions that showed effects significantly less than zero for either semantic or analogy tasks . Next , we computed two whole - brain regressions across all participants to examine effects of age , as well as effects of accu - racy while correcting for any effects of age . We limited our analyses to regions that were not significantly deactivated by the task using the mask described above . ( For readability , we refer to this mask as showing regions activated by the task . ) Z ( Gaussianised T / F ) statis - tical images were assessed for significance using permutation tests at a cluster defining threshold of Z > 2 . 3 and family - wise error cor - rection at p < . 05 ( Eklund , Nichols , & Knutsson , 2016 ; Worsley , 2001 ) . All thresholded and un - thresholded maps were uploaded to NeuroVault ( Gorgolewski et al . , 2016 ) .

For both semantic and analogy problems , we observed significant increases in performance across the age range of our participants ( Figure 2a ) . The effect of age on accuracy on both trial types was best fitted with a quadratic model , such that the greatest improvements occurred through the younger ages , with a plateau by the end of the teenage years ( semantic : β age 2 = – 0 . 34 , p age 2 < . 001 ; β age = 9 . 99 , p age < . 001 ; R 2adj = . 43 , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 52 . 90 , p < . 001 ; analogy : β age 2 = – 0 . 51 , p age 2 < . 001 ; β a ge = – 15 . 96 , p age < . 001 ; R 2 adj = . 61 , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 110 . 10 , p < . 001 ) . Similarly , we saw a decrease in RTs for both semantic and analogy tri - als ( Figure 2b ) that were best fitted with quadratic models ( semantic : β age 2 = 0 . 02 , p age 2 < . 001 ; β age = – 0 . 73 , p age 2 < . 001 ; R 2adj = . 52 , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 73 . 69 , p < . 001 ; analogy : β a ge 2 = 0 . 01 , p age 2 = . 07 ; β age = – 0 . 40 , p age = . 004 ; R 2adj = . 33 ( R 2adj for linear model = . 32 ) , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 34 . 79 , p < . 001 ) . Thus , we observed age - related improvements in accuracy and RTs on both semantic and analogy problems , particularly during childhood . Most strikingly , accuracy on analogy trials increased from about 50 % in the youngest participants to close to 100 % in the oldest . Importantly , although we observed age - related improvements on the semantic task , improvements on the analogy task were signif - icant even when including semantic accuracy as a covariate in the quadratic model for analogy accuracy ( β sem = 0 . 81 , p sem < . 001 , β age 2 = – 0 . 24 , p age 2 < . 001 ; β age = 7 . 82 , p age < . 001 ; R 2adj = . 78 , F ( 3 , 134 ) = 159 . 97 , p < . 001 ) . Thus , improved analogical reasoning over this age range cannot be fully accounted for by improved knowledge of FIGURE 2 Accuracy improved with age ( a ) , while response times decreased ( b ) for both semantic ( red ) and analogy ( blue ) trials . The number of errors on analogy trials decreased with age ( c ) , and semantic lures ( yellow ) were more common than perceptual lures ( purple ) , which were themselves more common than unrelated lures ( green ) across all ages ( c ) .

Rather , the abil - ity to retrieve a semantic associate is necessary but not sufficient for analogical reasoning . The number of semantic , perceptual , and unrelated lures that participants erroneously selected on analogy trials decreased with age ( Figure 2c ; semantic : β age 2 = 0 . 19 , p age 2 < . 001 ; β age = – 6 . 04 , p age < . 001 ; R 2adj = . 40 , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 47 . 15 , p < . 001 ; perceptual : β age 2 = 0 . 11 , p age 2 < . 001 ; β age = – 3 . 29 , p age < . 001 ; R 2adj = . 27 , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 26 . 41 , p < . 001 ; unrelated : β age 2 = – 0 . 04 , p age 2 = . 06 ; β age = – 1 . 41 , p age = . 005 ; R 2adj = . 26 , Rsq adj for linear model = . 25 , F ( 2 , 135 ) = 25 . 07 , p < . 001 ) . However , when participants of all ages made errors , they were pre - dominantly semantic lures ( 12 . 24 % ± 9 . 62 ) , followed by perceptual lures ( 5 . 07 % ± 4 . 83 ) , and then unrelated lures ( 2 . 81 % ± 3 . 49 ; paired t - tests : semantic > perceptual : t ( 137 ) = 10 . 64 , p < . 001 ; perceptual > unrelated : t ( 137 ) = 5 . 42 , p < . 001 ) . Thus , participants across the age range most often selected an answer choice that was semantically related to the C item , be it the target stimulus or a semantic lure – and errors of all types decreased with age . 3 . 2 | Functional MRI analyses We first investigated which brain regions were active during semantic and analogy trials , averaged across all participants ( Figure 3 ) . Overall , the same regions are active for both trial types , specifically inferior occipital , temporal , lateral prefrontal , and parietal regions ( see Tables S1 - 2 ) . While prefrontal , inferior occipital , and temporal regions did not show a difference in activation between these semantic and analogy trials , parietal cortex and medial occipital regions were more active for analogy than for semantic trials , perhaps related to the differ - ence in stimulus complexity between the conditions ( blue and pink in Figure 3 ) . In order to characterize age - related changes in activation during analogical reasoning , we correlated activation for these three contrasts of interest ( semantic > fixation , analogy > fixation and semantic > analogy ) with age across all participants ( Figure 4 ; Tables S3 – 4 ) . A broad swath of visual cortex showed increased activation with age for both semantic and analogy trials , and left aLIPC ( ~ BA 47 ; 45 ) and left DLPFC ( ~ BA 46 ; 9 ) , among other regions , additionally showed a strong age - related increase in activation for analogy trials . We extracted parameter estimates for each comparison from within this region of a priori interest in left aLIPC / DLPFC . As defined , estimates of analogy > fixation were correlated with age ( r = . 59 ) ; how - ever , this analysis revealed that semantic > fixation also showed this pattern ( r = . 51 , p < . 001 ) . The correlation between analogy > semantic activation and age was significant but very weak ( r = . 258 , p = . 012 ) . In sum , we observed age - related increases in activation on analogy and semantic trials , and the within - person increase in analogy activation was greater than the within - person increase in semantic activation , in left lateral PFC as well as visual cortex . Our final analyses were aimed at identifying regions for which acti - vation tracked individual differences in analogy accuracy even after correcting for the effects of age . The power of a whole - brain partial correlation analysis in this dataset is limited as a result of the strong correlations between accuracy and age , but given individual differ - ences in performance across our large sample , we nonetheless sought to disambiguate age - related and performance - related differences in activation . We tested whether analogy accuracy related to activation on analogy trials . We also tested whether analogy accuracy would be related to activation on semantic trials , given that the ability to retrieve a semantic associate is necessary for analogical reasoning . The first of these whole - brain analyses revealed no relationship between analogy accuracy and analogy trial activation controlling for age , after correcting for multiple comparisons . However , there was a positive relationship between semantic trial activation and analogy accuracy that survived after controlling for age ( r acc | age = . 47 ; Figure 5bii ; Table S5 ) . When we extracted individual contrast of parameter estimates FIGURE 3 Whole - brain activation patterns on average across all participants for the contrasts of semantic greater than fixation ( yellow ) , analogy greater than fixation ( red ) , and analogy greater than semantic ( blue ) .

This region did not show a pattern of increasing specificity of activation for analogy over semantic trials ( r acc | age = – . 14 , p = . 17 ) . Thus , left aLIPC activation on both semantic and analogy trials was correlated with analogy performance over and above effects of age . 4 | DISCUSSION The current study was designed to test which mechanisms support age - related improvements in analogical reasoning from middle child - hood to adolescence . Successful performance on analogy problems relied on participants’ ability to choose an item whose semantic rela - tion was analogous to that expressed in the A : B pair while avoiding choosing a non - analogous semantic associate or a perceptually simi - lar lure . In the current study , we extended the design in Wright et al . ( 2008 ) to include both a semantic lure and a perceptual lure among the four answer choices for each analogy problem . If there is not a seman - tic lure present in the analogy trial , then it would not be possible to know whether children were basing their answers on semantic related - ness or actually engaging in higher - order relational reasoning . In other words , given the presence of semantic and perceptual distractors , cor - rect performance on analogy trials should incorporate mechanisms that specifically support retrieval of analogical relationships , rather than mechanisms that support more general retrieval processes . Behaviorally , performance on both semantic and analogy tri - als improved with age , with the greatest improvements occurring between the ages of 6 and 9 years . The percentage of errors for semantic , perceptual and unrelated lures in the analogy task signifi - cantly decreased with age , but the most pronounced age - related improvement was observed for semantic lures . Even the youngest children chose semantic lures more often relative to perceptual and unrelated lures , but the number of semantic lure errors decreased dramatically over middle childhood . While the perceptual errors were subject to restricted range effects , it remains the case that even the youngest children studied , who made many errors , were more likely to choose semantically relevant items ( either targets or semantic lures ) than semantically irrelevant ones ( perceptual or unrelated lures ) . This finding fits well with previous research demon - strating an ability to avoid matching based on purely perceptual attributes occurring by the age of 6 ( Kotovsky & Gentner , 1996 ) . Although participants of all ages performed well on the semantic match task , the youngest participants in our study ( ~ ages 6 – 7 ) cor - rectly answered only about 50 % of the analogy problems , which is lower than expected based on prior studies in younger children , such as a study reporting analogical reasoning performance of around 60 % in 4 - year - olds with a similar paradigm ( Goswami & Brown , 1990 ) , which may indicate that some of our reasoning problems required more advanced semantic knowledge . Our analogy task revealed the biggest age - related differences between the ages 6 and 10 , but was sensitive to changes until around age 14 . FIGURE 4 Whole - brain activation patterns showing regions that show an increase in activation with age across all participants .

What drives the observed improvements in analogical reasoning across development ? We addressed this question by looking at our neuroimaging data collected while participants solved analogies . Specifically , we looked at patterns of brain activation to identify which mechanisms were associated with age - related differences in reasoning performance . Using fMRI , we were able to demonstrate that children as young as 6 years of age engage a network consisting of frontal , parietal and occipital regions while solving both analogy and semantic problems , echoing patterns found in previous work both in adults ( e . g . Watson & Chatterjee , 2012 ) and in children ( e . g . Crone et al . , 2009 ; Wright et al . , 2008 ) . This pattern of results suggests that , as early as we have studied here , children rely on regions qualitatively similar to those found in adults . Developmental differences in brain activation patterns do exist , however . Left lateral PFC became more active while solving analogy trials over childhood and adolescence , and – within this region – left aLIPC showed increasing activity during semantic trials , with increasing accuracy on analogy trials after correcting for the effects of age . The same pattern of results was replicated in activation during analogy trials , although this result did not survive whole - brain correction for multiple comparisons – perhaps because analogy task performance was related to age over a broader age range than semantic task performance . Following from numerous studies showing the importance of this region for controlled semantic retrieval ( e . g . Badre et al . , 2005 ; Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Poldrack et al . , 1999 ; Thompson - Schill et al . , 2002 ; Wagner et al . , 2001 ) , this pattern of results indicates that participants are able to engage left aLIPC more as they get older . The positive correlation between age and brain activation in this region , as well as the correlation with task performance over and above the effects of age , suggests that a key driver of improved analogical reasoning over middle childhood and early adolescence in an increase in the engage - ment of controlled semantic retrieval . However , this region was active across the entire age range . Therefore , we think that this neurocogni - tive process is already present by middle childhood , but is fine - tuned thereafter . We had predicted that age - related changes in RLPFC and IPL activation would contribute to improved performance , given other research involving a largely overlapping sample of participants that implicated these regions in the development of non - semantic rela - tional reasoning ( Wendelken et al . , 2011 , 2016 ) , as well as our prior adult fMRI research showing that these regions were active when adults made both semantic and non - semantic relational comparisons ( Wendelken et al . , 2012 ) . However , the current results are compatible with another prior adult fMRI study ( Wendelken et al . , 2008 ) . We had found that RLPFC was more active when participants evaluated the validity of an analogy ( e . g . painter : brush : : writer : pen ? ) than when they attempted to complete it ( e . g . painter : brush : : writer : _ _ _ ? ) . We argued that being asked to evaluate complete analogies promoted relational comparison between pairs of stimuli , whereas being asked to com - plete analogies promoted sequential retrieval of semantic associa - tions ( painter : brush - > type of implement relied on in a profession - > writer - > pen ) . Given that the task used in the present study requires relational completion rather than comparison , this prior study could explain why the present study implicates controlled semantic retrieval FIGURE 5 Whole - brain analysis showing regions that demonstrate an increase in activation with accuracy on analogy trials across all participants after correcting for the effects of age . Only the contrast of semantic greater than fixation ( shown in yellow ) showed a significant correlation in left aLIPC ( a ) . Panel ( b ) illustrates how activation in this region correlates with ( i ) age and ( ii ) accuracy on analogy trails after correcting for the effects of age . Very similar patterns are shown when activation on analogy trials are extracted from this region ( c ) . All results are constrained to be within regions liberally activated on average by the semantic or analogy tasks . No regions in the right hemisphere or the medial aspect of the left hemisphere passed the threshold for significance . Statistical tests are permutation tests , thresholds are set using a cluster defining threshold of Z > 2 . 3 and are family - wise error - corrected at p < . 05 .

Alternatively , it could be that RLPFC and IPL contribute indirectly to the ability to complete analogies , via a change in temporal coupling with aLIPC ; this hypothesis should be tested in the future with task - related functional connectivity analyses . To conclude , probing the underlying mechanisms supporting the development of analogical reasoning can inform researchers regard - ing how children approach analogical reasoning at different ages , and provide insight as to which particular mechanisms underlie age - related improvements in reasoning performance . Our work demonstrates that there is much improvement in analogical reasoning occurring over middle childhood , and to a lesser extent through early adolescence . Across our broad age range , participants engaged a common network of brain regions , thus suggesting that the neural circuitry supporting analogical reasoning is already in place by the time children enter ele - mentary school . However , this circuitry is still being refined as chil - dren mature and garner experience . Specifically , our results indicate that much of the refinement is occurring in regions that support the retrieval of task - relevant semantic associations . This finding supports the idea that , although younger children can solve analogies , they have difficulty selecting the appropriate semantic information in the presence of competing semantic associates . This work highlights the promise of developing pedagogical approaches for focusing students’ attention on the relevant aspects of analogies that are used to scaffold learning in the classroom ( Vendetti et al . , 2015 ) .
