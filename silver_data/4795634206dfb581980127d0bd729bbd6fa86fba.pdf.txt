P E R S P E C T I V E S every country that previously used asbestos now has a rising trend of mesothelioma deaths 32 ( FIG . 2 ) , and the mineral is as controversial as ever . As with other industrial cancers , an awareness of the cancer risk of asbestos has been hindered by powerful vested interests and sometimes bitter controversies among scientists — with the polarities of the scien - tific debate often reflecting who had commis - sioned the research . In 2001 , a line was drawn when the World Trade Organization stated that there is no safe level of asbestos expo - sure , that all types of asbestos are carcino - genic , and that ‘controlled’risk in manufac - ture , product use and disposal is unachievable 33 . Nevertheless , asbestos manu - facture continues in parts of the developing world . Canada still exports ( though does not use ) chrysotile , and its mining companies continue to proclaim that it is harmless and indispensable ( see Asbestos Institute web site ) . Even countries that have banned the material still have to devise strategies to cope with the asbestos that remains in place . The asbestos industry is in retreat , but the health effects of its products will stay with us for some time to come .

Masters TIMELINE HeLa cells — the first continuous cancer cell line — have been a mainstay of cancer research ever since their isolation from the aggressive glandular cervical cancer of a young woman more than 50 years ago . Knowledge of almost every process that occurs in human cells has been obtained using HeLa cells and the many other cell lines that have since been isolated . So why does fraud an ignorance surround the use of these and other human cancer cell lines ? Fifty years ago , there was intense competi - tion among cancer - research scientists for their laboratory to be the first to develop ‘human cancer in a test tube’ . Rodent can - cers had been cultured for many years by Warren Lewis , without any appreciable change in their appearance 1 . But , despite thousands of attempts , nobody had grown human cells in the laboratory for more than a few weeks . Tissue culture was nearly 50 years old 2 – 4 ( see TIMELINE ) and permanent cultures of animal cells had been established 5 , so surely it was possible ? The breakthrough came on 8 February 1951 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland . George Gey ( FIG . 1 ) was given a small sample and took it back to his laboratory . It was not a tissue - culture laboratory as we know it today . There were no laminar - flow cabinets or bottles of ster - ile culture media and sera . Tissue culture was done on the open bench , with the help of a bunsen burner to give a small window of relatively sterile air , using materials col - lected and prepared on an almost daily basis . Before starting work in the labora - tory , a trip to the slaughterhouse was needed in order to obtain plasma — taken by plunging a needle into a chicken’s heart . A visit to the abattoir was next , as calf embryos were collected , which could later be homogenized for extract . Finally , a trip to the labour ward was made , to suck off human placental blood from umbilical cords . This gruesome mixture of ingredi - ents was collected for the human cancer to feed on , and this time — for George Gey — it worked 6 . 316 | APRIL 2002 | VOLUME 2 www . nature . com / reviews / cancer P E R S P E C T I V E S To cancer research , HeLa is the equiva - lent of the goose that laid the golden egg — a constant supply of a precious and essen - tial resource . Within a few years , HeLa cells had been distributed worldwide and became the laboratory model of the cancer cell that would be used for much of cancer research . But they are not just used for can - cer research — HeLa cells are used throughout biomedical research to study the biochemical pathways of normal and diseased tissue in human cells . Although thousands of continuous cell lines from almost every type of human cancer have since been established — mainly in the 1970s and 1980s ( REF . 9 ) — HeLa is still the most widely used human cancer cell line . What was special about the cancer from which HeLa cells were grown ? Generally , the human cancers that grow permanently in culture are a selected group of very aggressive cancers that have acquired the necessary phenotypic and genotypic changes 10 . Almost all of the continuous cell lines are derived from high - grade , high - stage cancers . It is possible to grow some less aggressive cancers permanently , but very few scientists have had the patience , tenacity or skills to overcome the technical hurdles 11 . A short cut is to immortalize the cells with viral genes , the products of which bind and inhibit key proteins such as p53 and retinoblastoma ( RB ) . So why do normal human cells usually senesce and die , rather than undergo sponta - neous transformation in vitro to produce per - manent cultures , as normal rodent cells so often do ? One possibility is that the difference is related to the higher capacity of human cells for DNA repair 12 . Why was ‘human cancer in a test tube’such an important goal ? With cell lines , it is possible to go back to the same cancer again and again , bladder was almost entirely replaced with the tumour . By this time , her cancer was also growing like wildfire in the laboratory . The cell line was called HeLa , taken from the first two letters of Henrietta Lacks’names . The failure to preserve complete anonymity was regrettable , but , to give a measure of con - fidentiality , the donor was said to be Helen Lane or Helen Larson . It was not customary then to ask for written permission to obtain such samples for research purposes , and there is no record that Henrietta Lacks consented to the use of her cells . Attitudes were different then — prison inmates were shown on televi - sion being injected with HeLa cells , proud that they were repaying some of their debt to society ( The Way of All Flesh , BBC TV documentary screened on 19 March 1997 in the United Kingdom ) . When Mrs Lacks’children eventually dis - covered — more than 20 years later — what had happened to her tissue , they were shocked that cells from their mother had been distributed worldwide and no one had ever sought their views or permission . The requirement today for documented patient consent for research samples is , in part , a consequence of the HeLa cell story . The good Fifty years ago , the HeLa cell was seen as a great breakthrough , and possibly even the key to a cure for human cancer . The war on cancer and the worldwide hunt for the virus that was believed by some scientists to cause human cancer was soon to follow . Our knowledge of every fundamental process that occurs in human cells — whether normal or abnormal — has depended to a large extent on using HeLa and other cell lines as a model system . Much of what we know today , and much of what we do tomorrow , depends on the supply of HeLa and other cell lines . George Gey was a brilliant and highly respected scientist . By 1951 , he had been growing cells for nearly 30 years , and until 1937 had worked with Warren Lewis . He was the first to show in vitro transforma - tion ; he also made some of the first phase - microscope time - lapse films of living cells and developed roller tubes for culturing cells . His goal was to cure cancer , and he did not take time out to write papers . Crucially — for the success of HeLa cells — his wife Margaret was the chief technician and ‘the meticulous director of day - to - day operations in the laboratory’ 7 . The cancer sample came from the cervix of a young black lady called Henrietta Lacks , a 30 - year - old mother of five living on New Pittsburgh Avenue in Baltimore . Cervical cancer is normally slow growing , and most patients survive for at least five years after diagnosis . But this was not an ordinary can - cer , according to the gynaecologist Howard Jones . It was purple and soft , and he had never seen anything like it before ( or since , according to a television interview screened in the United Kingdom in 1997 ) . It did not respond to radiotherapy and was subse - quently shown ‘without a doubt’ to be a glandular cancer — a rare adenocarcinoma 8 — and not the usual epidermoid cancer of the cervix , as the original publication on HeLa 6 incorrectly described it . On 4 October 1951 , eight months after her cancer was diagnosed , Henrietta Lacks died , leaving her husband , David , a widower , and her children motherless . The autopsy report stated that her abdomen was filled with cancer deposits and her Ross G . Harrison develops the ‘hanging drop culture’ to study frog nerve - cell growth . Montrose T .

Courtesy of Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives . P E R S P E C T I V E S The bad Once George Gey had shown that it was possible to culture human cancers , every - one was able to do it . Suddenly , not only human cancers could be cultured , but also normal human cells became ‘sponta - neously transformed’ and proliferated at great speed in the laboratory . The number of cells could double about every 24 hours , and soon this was happening in biomedical laboratories worldwide . But of course it was not that easy to estab - lish a cell line from a human cancer — it remains very difficult to this day for most types of cancer — and normal human cells almost never spontaneously transform . It soon became clear that many of the cell lines were not what they were claimed to be . Monkey cells turned out to be human cells ; human cells were shown to be mouse cells 18 . But it took more than 15 years before the full extent of the problem was revealed . Until 1967 , it had not been possible to distinguish between cell lines that were derived from dif - ferent individuals of the same species . Stan Gartler then introduced the concept of bio - chemical polymorphism to the study of human cell lines 19 : some proteins have several different forms , and these forms can differ between individuals . In 1962 , the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) was set up to collect ‘authentic cell cultures’ . Stan Gartler was supplied 18 supposedly unique human cell lines by the ATCC and other sources , and investigated the expression of the enzyme glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase . Individuals have either the A or the B form of the enzyme , and these are distinguished according to mobility in a gel . The A form is almost exclusively found in black individu - als , at an incidence of ~ 30 % . HeLa and the other 17 cell lines that were tested expressed the type A form , and also had an identical phenotype for another polymorphic enzyme , phosphoglucomutase 1 . Stan Gartler suggested that perhaps all of these cell lines were HeLa cells 20 . So most of the new human cell lines that had been established since George Gey’s success back in 1951 were not new , they were just more HeLa cells . Scientists in dozens of laboratories had been careless and mixed up the cells . But Stan Gartler might as well have talked to himself — even scientists who must have known that his conclusions were correct attacked him . Too many people had written grants and publi - cations on the basis of the false cell lines from the ATCC to admit that there might be a problem . and have an endless supply of cells . Genetic drift and phenotypic change will be minimal within a laboratory 13 , provided that the cells are not grown continuously — instead , the cells should be replenished from frozen stocks every few weeks — and standard quality con - trol measures are used . A chromosomal analysis has shown that “the HeLa genome has been remarkably stable after years of continuous cultivation” 14 . However , it is also relatively easy to select strains of HeLa that have par - ticular properties by applying selection pressures — deliberately or accidentally — simply by altering the culture conditions , such as the medium or serum . For example , it is possible to select HeLa cells that grow in suspension rather than attached to the culture dish , or HeLa cells that are resistant to cancer drugs . One of the first applications of HeLa cells was in the fight against polio . George Gey and colleagues in Minneapolis showed that polio virus grew easily in HeLa cells , and killed the cells , which provided a simple diagnostic test 15 . Large numbers of cells were needed to grow the virus in order to produce the polio vaccine that Jonas Salk subsequently devel - oped . A HeLa production facility was set up at the Tuskegee Institute in Minnesota — which was not ideal , as both the summer and winter temperatures could be lethal to the cells dur - ing shipment . Nevertheless , about 600 , 000 cultures had been shipped within two years 16 . Jonas Salk even injected some patients with HeLa cells , although at the time he thought that he was growing the vaccine in normal monkey cells 7 . HeLa cells are even more important today than when they were first described . Every year for the past 20 years the number of citations for HeLa on MedLine has increased , with more than four times as many hits in the year 2000 as in 1980 . Many more publications use HeLa cells without acknowledgement ( see BOX 1 ) . HeLa and the other human cancer cell lines that have been established since 1951 are the bedrock of laboratory cancer research . Analysis of the frequency of use of cell lines in papers that were published in one recent issue of Cancer Research indicated that three - quarters of the publications used cell lines , and , in total , more than 112 cell lines had been used 17 . NATURE REVIEWS | CANCER VOLUME 2 | APRIL 2002 | 317 Box 1 | A sample of the better known HeLa cell cross - contaminants Comprehensive lists of ~ 100 early examples of cross - contamination are given in the references of Walter Nelson - Rees 21 – 23 . The cell lines described briefly in this box are authentic HeLa cells , and there is no evidence that they contain any genetic information from any other cell type . As a result of genetic drift and being subjected to different conditions in various laboratories , each strain might have genetic and phenotypic differences . There is no common stock of HeLa cells , and consequently every batch from each source will be slightly different . The differences between the various cell stocks labelled HeLa are probably as great as the differences between these various strains given different names . Within the last year , some of the false cell lines listed below were catalogued and sold by some cell banks under the false name and false description . • HeLa ( KB ) . The HeLa subline KB was thought to be derived from an oral cancer 33 . It was cited more than 300 times during the period 1998 – 2000 in MedLine , and some of these studies used the cells as a model of skin or head and neck cancer 34 , 35 . Few of the papers mention or seem to be aware that the cells are derived from a glandular cancer of the cervix . • HeLa ( HEp - 2 ) . The HeLa subline HEp - 2 was thought to be derived from a cancer of the larynx 36 . It was cited mre than 300 times during the period 1998 – 2000 in MedLine and is frequently used by virologists as a human epithelial cell line 37 , 38 . Usually , there is no mention that these cells are a HeLa subline and are derived from a cervical cancer . • HeLa ( WISH ) , HeLa ( AV3 ) HeLa ( FL ) . These three sublines of HeLa were all thought to be derived from amnion cells , the most well - known and widely used one being WISH 39 . Despite their origin from cervical cancer , these cell lines are sometimes used in the fields of reproduction and endocrinology , and are described as being normal human amnion cells 40 , 41 . • HeLa ( L132 ) . The HeLa subline L132 was thought to be derived from normal human embryonic lung cells 42 . These HeLa cells are sometimes described as being normal embryonic human lung epithelial cells 43 , 44 . • HeLa ( Intestine 407 ) . The HeLa subline INT 407 was thought to be derived from human intestinal epithelial cells 45 . Despite its origin from a cancer of the cervix , it is still used as a model of normal human gastrointestinal cells 46 , 47 . • HeLa ( Chang liver ) . The HeLa subline called Chang liver was thought to be derived from normal liver cells 48 . Despite being cervical cancer cells , Chang liver cells are sometimes used in studies of hepatic - cell physiology 49 , 50 . 318 | APRIL 2002 | VOLUME 2 www . nature . com / reviews / cancer P E R S P E C T I V E S whether or not it was HeLa or another cell line does not seem important . However , in those cases in which the investigator has assumed a specific tissue origin of the cell line ( such as liver or lymphocytes ) , the work is of dubious value 20 . There is , at present , a campaign to have the false cell lines renamed with their correct designation 32 . The future HeLa cells are even more important today than they were when first grown by George Gey 50 years ago . Cell lines have been , and will continue to be , the model system of the cancer cell that is used by most cancer research scientists . However , the HeLa story also shows the consequences when peer review fails and there is a lack of quality control . John R .

Natl Cancer Inst . Monogr . 26 , 167 – 195 ( 1967 ) . Continued use of a cell line that has been contaminated with HeLa cells is often based on claims that the HeLa cells have acquired the specialized properties of the other cell type , making the false cell line — despite being composed of HeLa cells alone — a use - ful model of some other tissue . These find - ings are remarkable , as the HeLa cells would have shared the same substrate as the other cell type for only a few days , if at all . There is no evidence that the cross - contaminated sublines have a mixed parentage , underwent any form of somatic cell hybridization or exchanged any genetic information . How could HeLa cells have acquired spe - cialized characteristics of normal and cancer cell types , such as lung , amnion , liver and heart ? If it is possible for one cell type to gain characteristics of another cell type , simply by growing the two cell types together for a short period , an important scientific break - through has gone unrecognized . Many journals do not want to take responsibility for the widespread publica - tion of false data . The usual excuses are that the problem is already widely known ( so should it continue to be ignored ? ) , the information is not of sufficient scientific interest or there is not enough space avail - able for this ( trivial ? ) issue . Some journal editors consider that it is not their responsi - bility to set standards , referring to scientific societies and funding bodies instead . The peer - review process has almost com - pletely failed in the respect of false cell lines . If scientific journals required that each cell line used was authenticated before publica - tion , all but the most deliberate fraud would disappear . DNA profiling provides a simple and cheap method of authentication , it is available to everyone and could prevent most of the problems 31 . Perhaps the main reason underlying the continued use of false cell lines is certain cell - line banks . Despite being aware of the prob - lem and being the most frequent source of cells , some have continued to sell cells under false descriptions . The small print has some - times indicated that the false cell line might have ‘HeLa characteristics’ , which in itself is misleading — of course HeLa cells have HeLa characteristics . What is the significance of the rising mountain of incorrect data ? The implication is that ~ 20 % of publications using cell lines contain false data , but that does not mean that all of these publications are misleading . In the description of HeLa cross - contamina - tion published in 1968 , Stan Gartler summa - rized the position . If the investigator’s requirement was for any human cell line , Stan Gartler has always felt that the iden - tification of cross - contamination is rela - tively unimportant , as any competent scien - tist can easily authenticate the cells . But because many scientists did not seem to be making these checks , one man went into open battle to expose the problem . Walter Nelson - Rees ( FIG . 2 ) was head of the Oakland Cell Culture Laboratory and Bank , part of the University of California at Berkeley . In the 1970s , Walter Nelson - Rees devel - oped techniques for authenticating cell lines . With little consideration of the personal cost or of the sensibilities of the people whose mistakes and scandals he revealed 7 , Walter Nelson - Rees ruthlessly and relentlessly pur - sued and exposed the HeLa cross - contami - nants 21 – 23 . By the early 1980s , every human cancer cell line , false or not , was a HeLa sus - pect . So when Nelson - Rees retired in 1981 , it was a battle won . Or was it ? The ugly Sadly , the battle was not won 24 . In 1981 , the editor of an influential journal described individuals such as Walter Nelson - Rees as ‘self - appointed vigilantes’and said it would be tragic if they corrupted the civilized habits of scientists 25 . With such attitudes holding sway , and Nelson - Rees retired , the ‘civilized habits’of ignorance , complacency and deception were , again , unchecked . Today , it is estimated that ~ 20 % of cell lines are falsely labelled ( mainly due to intraspecies contamination ) 26 , 27 and the problem has spread to many other human cancer cell lines 28 – 30 . HeLa cells are used under many other names with false descrip - tions ( BOX 1 ) . Chaos reigns and fraud — unwitting or deliberate — is condoned . Figure 2 | Walter Nelson - Rees .
