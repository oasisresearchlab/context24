Irritable bowel syndrome : Role of food in pathogenesis and management Ashraf MORCOS , * Ted DINAN † & Eamonn MM QUIGLEY ‡ * Department of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine , Midwestern Regional Hospital , Limerick , † Department of Psychiatry , University College Cork , and ‡ Department of Medicine , Cork University Hospital , Cork , Ireland Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) com - monly report the precipitation of symptoms on food ingestion . Though the role of dietary constituents in IBS has not been extensively studied , food could con - tribute to symptom onset or even the causation of IBS through a number of mechanisms . First , the physi - ological response of the intestine to food ingestion could precipitate symptoms in predisposed individu - als ; second , there is some evidence that allergy or intolerance to a particular food can produce IBS - like symptoms , third , certain foods may alter the compo - sition of the luminal milieu , either directly or indi - rectly through effects on bacterial metabolism , and thus induce symptoms and , ﬁnally , IBS may develop following exposure to food - borne pathogens . Anti - cipatory , psychological factors generated by previous negative experiences with food ingestion or other factors may also contribute though their contribution has been scarcely quantiﬁed . Not surprisingly , there is considerable interest in the potential roles of diet and food supplements in the therapy of IBS ; for the most part , the evidence base for such recommendations remains slim though certain probiotics show consid - erable promise . KEY WORDS : enteric microbiota , food , food allergy , food intolerance , irritable bowel syndrome , probiotics . IBS : PREVALENCE AND PATHOGENESIS Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) is one of the most common disorders encountered in modern medicine : community surveys in western Europe and North America suggesting a prevalence of around 10 % in the adult population . 1 It should be stressed , in addition , that IBS appears to be common worldwide regardless of geography or socioeconomic status . There is no single speciﬁc diagnostic test for IBS : its deﬁnition relies , therefore , either on the exclusion of diseases that may share its symptomatology in whole or in part , or on the application of symptom - based criteria whose integrity has been validated in cross - sectional and longitudinal studies . The cardinal symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort and bowel dys - function . Typically , these are interrelated such that , for example , an affected patient may report that his , or more likely her , symptoms worsen when constipated , only to be relieved once a bowel movement has been achieved . In clinical research most studies apply the deﬁnitions enshrined in the Rome criteria , whose third iteration ( Rome III ) was released in early 2006 and deﬁned IBS as : Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort ( an uncom - fortable sensation not described as pain ) at least 3 days per month in the last 3 months associated with two or more of the following : Correspondence to : Eamonn MM QUIGLEY , Department of Medicine , Clinical Sciences Building , Cork University Hospital , Cork , Ireland .

These criteria should have been fulﬁlled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis . 2 As individual IBS symptoms are very non - speciﬁc and may occur in a host of other clinical conditions , the potential for diagnostic confusion is considerable . Furthermore , a condition such as IBS , whose deﬁni - tion rests exclusively on the interpretation of symp - toms , is certain to encompass a heterogeneous population whose constituents may ultimately be found to have different causes for their symptoms . Not surprisingly , the search for a unifying hypothesis to explain all IBS symptoms has proven unfruitful . Several phenomena undoubtedly contribute to symp - tom genesis , including disordered bowel motility ( spasms ) , visceral hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia , altered cerebral processing of gut events , environmen - tal stressors and intrinsic psychopathology . The inter - play between such gut and central nervous system factors has led to the concept of gut – brain axis dys - function as fundamental to the induction of symp - toms in IBS . According to this concept and putting it simply , the interaction or interplay between gut dys - function and a central factor , such as stress or anxiety , leads to the development of symptoms . Another factor , food ingestion , commonly invoked as the cause of symptoms onset , is the subject of this review . Detailed studies of relationships between diet and symptoms in IBS are surprisingly few in number and those that have been performed share some meth - odological limitations . This represents a glaring gap in IBS research and needs to be rectiﬁed . Furthermore , it must also be noted that the most complete dietary surveys among IBS patients in the community failed to detect any differences in dietary composition between IBS patients and community controls : 3 , 4 why this discrepancy between what patients report , on the one hand , and dietary surveys , on the other ? FOOD AND PHYSIOLOGY IN IBS Many IBS patients describe the exacerbation of their symptoms immediately following food ingestion : 5 the sudden onset of abdominal cramps accompanied by a striking urge to evacuate one’s bowels and the need to do so as quickly as possible being a very common narrative . While many patients jump to the conclu - sion that this must imply a food allergy , there are , in fact , many potential explanations for such postpran - dial exacerbations of IBS symptoms . The most likely explanation , in most instances , is purely physiologi - cal . Given the primary function of the gut , it should come as no surprise that food ingestion is the most potent stimulus of such gastrointestinal functions as motility and secretion . The provocation of either of these could induce symptoms in IBS . There is , indeed , a considerable amount of literature to indicate important potentiating interactions between nutrient intake , motility and visceral sensa - tion among IBS patients , interactions that may directly lead to symptoms . Simren et al . , for example , described a nutrient - dependent exaggeration of both the sensory component of the gastrocolonic response 6 and of rectal sensitivity to balloon distension , 7 in IBS . Other studies reported impaired small bowel gas propulsion in IBS patients with bloating during an intestinal lipid infusion administered to mimic the effects of dietary fat . 8 Lipid is , indeed , an especially potent stimulant of both motor and sensory responses . In one study , intra - duodenal lipids were found to increase colonic sensitivity and alter the pattern of viscerosomatic pain referral in IBS 9 . In other studies , Awad et al . documented lower postprandial thresholds for sensation of gas , perception of urge and pain threshold in constipation - predominant IBS ( IBS - C ) patients compared with controls . 10 Caldarella et al . found a similar augmentation of visceral sensi - tivity by intra - duodenal lipids in both diarrhea - predominant IBS ( IBS - D ) and IBS - C in comparison to controls . 11 The mediation of these food - related effects appears to involve both vagal and endocrine components . IBS may involve an autonomic hyper - responsiveness to visceral stimuli that occurs throughout the entire gut . 12 These autonomic disturbances may also have implica - tions for changes in cellular immune functions along the neuro - endocrine - immune axis that may be rel - evant to the pathogenesis of IBS 13 . That some of these responses might be generated in the gut itself is suggested by the observation of altered autonomic responses to colonic distension in IBS . Whether such responses , in turn , generate the exaggerated reaction to food or whether postprandial events reﬂect an intrinsic autonomic defect or a centrally driven response must await further studies . 14 A role for a Journal of Digestive Diseases 2009 ; 10 ; 237 – 246 238 A Morcos et al . © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch , Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd . centrally mediated effects is supported by one , albeit small , study that demonstrated that patients with IBS - D showed a signiﬁcant postprandial increase in cortisol , a well - recognized mediator of the central stress response , which was not evident in controls or IBS - C 15 . The same authors also showed a signiﬁcant correlation between the vagal response , assessed by heart rate variability at base line and after a meal , and the postprandial increase in gastrointestinal symp - toms in IBS - D 15 . Other hormonal factors may also be relevant . In a study by Sjolund et al . , IBS patients exhibited a stunted motilin response to both water intake and a fatty meal . In contrast , a fatty meal elic - ited an exaggerated and prolonged cholecystokinin release in IBS patients . 16 The interplay between stress , eating behavior and symptoms is exempliﬁed by studies of patients with eating disorders . 17 For example , in one study the com - bination of high interpersonal perfectionism and low interpersonal self - efﬁcacy was associated with binge dieting . 18 In a small study using the perceived stress scale and the eating behavior pattern questionnaire , perceived stress was associated with haphazard plan - ning of meals and emotional eating . 19 Stress may also inﬂuence the choice of macronutrient . It has been shown , for example , that stress selectively elevated the intake of a preferred high fat intake with consequent increased IBS manifestations . 20 While the physiological response to food intake in IBS remains to be completely elucidated , it is evident that food does , indeed , interact with motor and sensory factors indicted in the pathogenesis of IBS in a manner that could plausibly precipitate or exacerbate symp - toms . As ever in the case of IBS , these responses cannot be viewed in isolation but must be looked at in the context of the gut – brain axis and , in particular , in the framework of the stress response . Dietary factors in IBS Given the aforementioned roles of motility and sensation in the pathogenesis of IBS symptoms and of the known importance of serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytry - ptamine , 5 - HT ) as a neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system , not to mention its role in brain cir - cuitry , one group of dietary constituents that may be of special importance to the IBS sufferer is that which includes serotonin precursors . 4 About 1 % of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin , with most of 5 - HT synthesis taking place in the enterochromafﬁn cells of the gut . However , approximately 10 – 20 % of serotonin biosynthesis occurs centrally once tryp - tophan has crossed the blood – brain barrier ( BBB ) . The brain’s storage capacity for tryptophan is limited and the central availability of tryptophan is largely deter - mined by active transport across the BBB where it competes with other large neutral amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine , in addition to its own metabolite , kynurenine . About 99 % of dietary tryp - tophan is metabolized along the kynurenine pathway , which is regulated by the enzymes tryptophan 2 , 3 - dioxygenase ( TDO ) and indoleamine 2 , 3 - dioxygenase ( IDO ) . 21 While TDO is localized to the liver and is upregulated by corticosteroids , IDO is expressed by a variety of cells and is inducible , preferentially , by the pro - inﬂammatory cytokine interferon - g ( IFN - g ) . High cortisol levels or high levels of pro - inﬂammatory cytok - ines could inﬂuence the metabolism of tryptophan . The way in which a variety of dietary changes could affect concentrations of 5 - HT in the brain and / or enteric nervous system can thus be visualized . Indeed , it has already been demonstrated that dietary mani - pulations to either deplete or artiﬁcially increase tryptophan levels in the blood can affect anxiety and gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients . 22 Interest - ingly , a recent study showed that the activity of IDO is enhanced in IBS patients ; 23 though a linkage to dietary intake or to the degradation of dietary components by the microbiota has not been explored . Food intolerance and allergy Many IBS patients report problems with speciﬁc foods , most commonly implicating milk and wheat products , caffeine , fructose and certain meats as the offending foods . 5 , 24 Reports of speciﬁc foods inducing symptoms raise the issue of allergy and here , again , other possibilities need to be considered . First , those who are intolerant of lactose ( due to lactase deﬁ - ciency ) or fructose or sorbitol will develop symptoms on exposure , such as abdominal cramps , urgency and diarrhea , which mimic those of IBS and need to be carefully identiﬁed and distinguished . The beneﬁts of lactose , fructose and sorbitol exclusion among IBS subjects , in general , have been inconclusive , at best , and frankly disappointing , at worst 25 – 34 Discrepancies between studies may reﬂect differences in the popula - tion prevalence of either lactase deﬁciency 27 – 30 or fruc - tose intolerance . Formal correlations between tests of tolerance and responses to exclusion have , in some hands , been unconvincing 27 , 33 and exclusion of fruc - tose and lactose has had highly variable effects . 35 Second , the effects of some of these foods may reﬂect their potency as stimulants of the aforementioned Journal of Digestive Diseases 2009 ; 10 ; 237 – 246 Food and the irritable bowel syndrome 239 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch , Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd . physiological functions . Finally , there remains the nagging question of food allergy per se . Poorly absorbed , highly fermentable short - chain car - bohydrates and polyols ( described by the acronym FODMAP : fermentable oligo - , di - and monosa - charides and polyols ) which include fructans , rafﬁ - nose , lactose , polyols and galactans have the potential , by virtue of their osmotic effects in the distal small bowel and colon , to potentiate IBS symptoms like bloating and diarrhea . Galactans are present in such common dietary constituents as onions , legumes , cabbage and sprouts and fructans are found in wheat , onions , spring onions , shallots , leeks , arti - chokes and chicory . Studies of the impact of FODMAP - free diets from one research group in patients with IBS suggest that this approach may be of value in some patients . 36 , 37 The term food allergy should be reserved for those instances where a clear allergic response to a speciﬁc food has been identiﬁed . Characteristically , these responses , which can be profoundly symptomatic , are based on the development of immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) - type antibodies to a food constituent ( important examples here would include peanut and ﬁsh aller - gies ) . There is no consistent evidence for a role for this type of allergic response in IBS . 38 – 42 In one study , indeed , the authors could differentiate between IBS and food allergy on the basis of symptom analysis , suggesting that they were distinct clinical entities . 43 More enthusiasm has surrounded the concept that a different antibody class ( IgG ) may be implicated in food - related responses in IBS and two different centers have reported signiﬁcant symptomatic responses among some of those IBS subjects who instituted elimination diets based on a base line IgG antibody proﬁle . 44 – 46 These studies need to be replicated . 41 Relations between IBS and one of the most common and well - deﬁned disorders based on an immuno - logical response to a food constituent , namely celiac disease , have also come under the microscope of late . As the true prevalence of celiac disease comes to be recognized and as the breadth of the spectrum of symptoms associated with this disorder is appreciated , the potential for overlap between IBS and celiac symp - tomatologies has increasingly emerged . Nowadays it has become common to identify celiac disease among individuals presenting with relatively vague abdomi - nal symptoms that may , in the past , have been dis - missed as IBS . 47 – 52 This has led to the recommendation that serological testing for celiac should be performed among all newly presenting IBS subjects in popula - tions where the prevalence of IBS is known to be high . 50 IBS - type symptoms may persist among celiac patients following the institution of a gluten - free diet even when compliance is apparently complete . 48 Does this represent the coincident occurrence of two common disorders , IBS and celiac disease or is there a real association ? Could the persistence or occurrence of IBS - type symptoms in this context represent the effects of persistent low - grade inﬂammation or merely reﬂect the impact of unrecognized or inadvertent non - compliance ? These issues remain unresolved . What of the IBS patient who protests wheat intoler - ance but in whom celiac serology and small intestinal biopsies are normal ? Until recently this association would have been passed off as imagined ; now comes intriguing data to suggest that those IBS patients with wheat intolerance and who possess the genotype most closely associated with celiac disease ( HLA DQ2 or DR3 ) but who do not have overt evidence of the dis - order ( as evidenced by typical serological markers and appropriate changes in small intestinal histology ) can be shown to exhibit other immunological evidence of gluten reactivity and to respond to a gluten - free diet . 53 Is there a state of gluten sensitivity which does not fulﬁll the current criteria for celiac disease ? 54 The plot thickens ! Food and the enteric ﬂora : potentially interrelated factors in IBS Recently , a new twist has been added to the IBS story with reports from a number of laboratories of poten - tially related phenomena , namely , subtle alterations in immune function and disturbances in the compo - sition of the intrinsic bacterial population of the gut ( the enteric ﬂora or microbiota ) . The possibility that the enteric ﬂora , or microbiota , could play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS has only very recently begun to attract concerted scientiﬁc attention though evidence to suggest a link has been extant for some time and contains several distinct strands : (cid:129) epidemiological evidence that antibiotic use may predispose to IBS or to exacerbations 55 (cid:129) epidemiological , clinical and experimental evi - dence for the existence of post - infectious IBS . (cid:129) evidence , both experimental and clinical , for a role for low grade inﬂammation ( perhaps triggered by luminal bacteria ) in IBS , Journal of Digestive Diseases 2009 ; 10 ; 237 – 246 240 A Morcos et al . © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch , Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd . (cid:129) the suggestion that IBS may be associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , or qualitative or quantitative changes in the colonic ﬂora ( dysbiosis ) , (cid:129) evidence to indicate that the manipulation of the gut ﬂora by antibiotics or probiotics may ameliorate symptoms in IBS . Of these two issues , namely , post - infectious IBS and the use of probiotics to treat IBS are of particular relevance to the topic at hand , given that some of the former instances have been related to food - borne infections . To date , the possibility that antibiotic residues contained in food could disturb the micro - biota and contribute to IBS symptoms has not been addressed . POST - INFECTIOUS IBS We are now beginning to see real data to directly support the concept of post - infectious or post - dysenteric IBS . 56 First reported by McKendrick and Read , 57 the occurrence of IBS following episodes of bacteriologically - conﬁrmed gastroenteritis has now been documented in several studies . 58 – 68 Some of these episodes have been directly and exclusively linked to food - borne pathogens . 64 Thabane et al . recently performed a systematic review and concluded that the overall risk for the development of IBS was increased six - fold following an episode of bacterial gastro - enteritis with younger subjects , those who have prolonged fever during the episode of gastroenteritis and those who suffer from anxiety or depression being at greatest risk . 69 In individual studies , being female , having a more severe initial illness and possessing premorbid psychopathology predicted those most at risk . 65 – 68 The nature of the infectious agent does not appear to confer additional risk . These symptoms are not transient ; in a Scandinavian study in which 12 % of their subjects had IBS within 3 months of gas - troenteritis , 9 % still had symptoms ﬁve years later . 66 Neal et al . documented similar recovery rates for post - infectious and non - post - infectious IBS in a six - year follow - up study . 70 One of these studies went on to establish a direct link between prior exposure to an infectious agent , persist - ing low grade inﬂammation and IBS . 61 In this study , an increase in the number of chronic inﬂammatory cells in the rectal mucosa was seen only among those exposed patients who had developed IBS . Others have demonstrated a persisting increase in rectal mucosal enteroendocrine cells , T lymphocytes and gut perme - ability in patients with post - dysenteric IBS . 62 , 63 These observations are important as they indicate a rela - tionship between perturbations of the microbiota , mucosal inﬂammation and IBS , a hypothesis that is amply supported by data from studies in experimental animal models . A number of parasites , such as Dientamoeba fragilis , Blastocystis hominis and Giardia have been associated with the development of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms which may mimic IBS 71 , 72 whether parasitic infections can trigger IBS , per se , is unknown . Very recently , an outbreak of food - borne viral gastroenteri - tis was associated with the new onset of an IBS - type syndrome in 24 % of affected subjects when inter - viewed three months later ; subsequent follow sug - gested that post - viral IBS was more transient than its bacterial counterpart . 73 Post - infectious IBS may explain only a minority of cases of IBS { 1 - 6 . 7 % in one recent study 74 } but it does represent a clear link between exposure to an environ - mental agent , such as a food - borne pathogen , inﬂam - mation and IBS in predisposed individuals . PROBIOTICS AND PREBIOTICS IN IBS ; POTENTIAL MODULATORS OF DYSBIOSIS AND IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION ? For some time various studies have suggested the presence of qualitative changes in the colonic ﬂora ( dysbiosis ) in IBS patients ; a relative decrease in the population of biﬁdobacteria being the most consistent ﬁnding . 75 – 77 It should be noted , however , that these ﬁndings have not always been reproduced and the methods employed have been subject to question . More recent studies using molecular techniques have conﬁrmed the presence of an altered ﬂora in IBS though the precise nature of these changes remains to be deﬁned . 77 – 79 Nevertheless , qualitative changes in the colonic ﬂora , be they primary or secondary , could lead to the proliferation of species that produce more gas and short chain fatty acids and are more avid in the deconjugation of bile acids . With regard to the former , the displacement of gas - forming species could result in local changes in gas production , a development that may be poorly tolerated by IBS patients who seem to have difﬁculties with the transport of gas along the intestine 80 and to be overly sensitive to gas - induced distension . 81 Here again there is potential for an inter - action with food . One can readily visualize how the ingestion of poorly digested or indigestible carbohy - drates , by acting as substrates for the colonic ﬂora , Journal of Digestive Diseases 2009 ; 10 ; 237 – 246 Food and the irritable bowel syndrome 241 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch , Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd . could exacerbate this situation further . The excess pro - duction of short chain fatty acids and deconjugated bile salts could , in turn , lead to clinically signiﬁcant changes in water and electrolyte transport in the colon and affect colonic motility and / or sensitivity . Based on the aforementioned disturbances in the enteric ﬂora , as well as on the potential for certain probiotics to exert anti - inﬂammatory effects and to thereby reverse the immunological changes described above , there has been , of late considerable interest in the use of probiotics in IBS . Given their safety proﬁle , probiotics , if effective , would at ﬁrst sight also appear to be a more attractive than antibiotics as potential manipulators of the gut ﬂora in IBS . Are probiotics effective in IBS ? Several factors complicate the inter - pretation of clinical trials of probiotics preparations in IBS . Many studies have been underpowered and some earlier studies were even uncontrolled and not blinded . Furthermore , results between studies are difﬁcult to compare because of differences in study design , the use of non - validated and differing end points , and variations in probiotic dose and strain . Nevertheless , there has been some , but by no means consistent , evidence of symptom improvement . 82 – 104 More recent reviews 105 , 106 have explored the scientiﬁc rationale behind the use of probiotics in IBS and reviewed the clinical results from studies performed over the past two decades . Outcomes continue to be variable . Some studies report little evidence of efﬁcacy while others document responses only for speciﬁc symptoms or in selected populations . It is noteworthy that ﬂatulence , bloating and distension , common and distressing symptoms in IBS , 107 seem especially responsive to probiotic therapy . Indeed , a recent study using objective methods demonstrated the ability of one probiotic to reduce abdominal distension and accelerate colonic transit . 108 In another study probiotic administration was shown to reduce bacterial fer - mentation with an associated improvement in ﬂatu - lence . 101 Furthermore , other studies have employed probiotic cocktails rather than single isolates , ren - dering it difﬁcult to deduce what were the active moieties . 97 – 99 Nevertheless , the conclusion of a num - ber of systematic reviews has been that probiotics , in general , have a beneﬁcial effect in IBS . 109 – 112 One particular probiotic , Biﬁdobacterium infantis 35624 appears to have more global effects in IBS . 113 In the ﬁrst of two studies with this organism , this strain of Biﬁdobacterium was found to be superior to both a Lactobacillus and placebo for each of the cardinal symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome ( abdomi - nal pain / discomfort , distension / bloating and difﬁcult defecation ) , as well as for a composite score . 114 More recently these results were replicated in a much larger , dose - ranging , primary care - based study involving 360 IBS patients , where Biﬁdobacterium infantis , in an encapsulated format and in a dose of 10 8 was associ - ated with signiﬁcant improvements in the cardinal symptoms of IBS as well as in the patients’ global assessment of all symptoms . At the study end , over 60 % of patients randomized to the Biﬁdobacterium felt better than before therapy ; a therapeutic gain of over 20 % over placebo . 115 To date , most studies of probiotics in IBS have been short term , though two studies of 5 and 6 months in duration , respectively , 94 , 97 suggest that continued use is associated with sustained efﬁcacy . An alternative approach to the manipulation of the microbiota is to administer a prebiotic preparation to promote the growth of selected species such as Biﬁdo - bacteria or Lactobacilli . Indeed , a number of substances that have been used in IBS - C in particular , such as ﬁber and lactulose , can be regarded as exerting prebi - otic effects . While there have been as yet relatively few studies of prebiotics , either alone 116 or in combination with a probiotic , 117 in IBS , there is , at least , the sug - gestion that this strategy may also have some efﬁcacy . The interactions between food and the microbiota may extend far beyond the well - deﬁned prebiotic effect and could involve the release of a variety of biologically active compounds into the intestinal lumen that could exert effects on the mucosa , the immune compartment and neuro - enteric apparatus of the gut wall and well beyond to inﬂuence , either ben - eﬁcially or negatively , symptoms in the IBS patient . For all these reasons , food and functional foods , in particular , have emerged as potential therapies for IBS but in a very new and very different context ; one in which IBS is viewed as a disorder of immune regula - tion 118 related , perhaps , to disturbances in the interac - tion between the ﬂora and the host . DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS Apart from the various dietary restrictions that have been discussed above , a variety of other dietary rec - ommendations are commonly given to the IBS patient or sufferer . Most have no basis in science or clinical evidence . Furthermore , a component of IBS dietary advice that had become enshrined in the IBS thera - peutic armamentarium , namely supplemental ﬁber , Journal of Digestive Diseases 2009 ; 10 ; 237 – 246 242 A Morcos et al . © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch , Chinese Society of Gastroenterology and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd . has recently come under ﬁre . Quite simply , the evi - dence that dietary ﬁber alleviates any symptom of IBS other than constipation , or contributes to general well - being , is simply not there ! 119 – 123 Indeed , in some patients , ﬁber , perhaps through its stimulation of bacterial fermentation , 124 may exacerbate rather than relieve symptoms . 125 Can we translate this informa - tion into useful clinical advice for our patients ? While it has been traditional to instruct IBS patients on a variety of food management strategies and restric - tions , there is no validated data on which to base these recommendations . We simply do not have enough information on the role of diet and its various and highly complex constituents in IBS , in general , or in a speciﬁc subgroup . 126 , 127 The knowledge gap here is Grand Canyonesque in its proportions . CONCLUSIONS Food , diet and food supplements are an important , but poorly studied , aspect of IBS . Food undoubtedly precipitates symptoms in many IBS patients ; the precise mode of this effect remains unclear and may vary from one individual to another . The role of food as an inducer of allergic or inﬂammatory responses in IBS deserves further study . While a sheer lack of good data currently precludes the provision of evidence - based dietary advice to an individual IBS patient , recent studies provide good evidence for a role for certain speciﬁc probiotics in the management of IBS .
