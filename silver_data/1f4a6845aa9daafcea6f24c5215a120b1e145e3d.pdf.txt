Design : cross - sectional study during April 15 - 24 th in Hospital Costa del Sol ( Marbella , Spain ) , excluding HCW with previous COVID19 . Setting : hospital based , focused on patient care areas COVID19 . Participants : 498 subjects , 80 % women . Participation was offered to all the HCW of Emergencies , Intensive Care and Anesthesia , Internal Medicine and Pneumology . Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate . Intervention : naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography . On the day of sampling , a health questionnaire was answered , reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days . Main outcome measures : percentage of HCW with positive PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 , percentage of HCW with positive IgG for SARS - CoV - 2 . Results : Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 positive ( 0 . 4 % ) . Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling , but one of them had had a CoVID - 19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM ; therefore , only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier ( 0 . 2 % ) . 9 workers with positive IgG ( 1 . 8 % ) were detected . Conclusions : the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among health workers of the services directly involved in the care of patients with CoVID - 19 was very low in our center . This type of strategy can be one more tool in controlling the pandemic . .

At the end of January 2020 , the first case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was declared in Spain ( 1 ) . In China ' s initial outbreak , health workers had accounted for 3 . 8 % of total reported cases ( 2 ) , but in Spain , at the end of April 2020 this group accounted for 20 % of all cases ( 3 ) . From the beginning of the pandemic , the identification of asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS - CoV - 2 has been advocated as one of the fundamental measures to reduce its spread ( 4 ) . The importance of these subjects is that they can act as vehicles for the virus , transmitting it to individuals who may be infected . Models have been carried out that have attempted to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic individuals within China , estimating that 86 % of all infections were not documented in the first moment of the pandemic , before mobility restrictions , being these responsible for the 79 % of documented infections ( 5 ) . Therefore , it is important to determine the degree of asymptomatic carriers among the population of health workers , with a view to reducing transmission to other workers and to patients treated for reasons other than CoVID - 19 . This identification , together with the appropriate measures , could result in less spread of the virus from the healthcare center and , therefore , in fewer healthcare providers and patients affected by COVID - 19 . In this article , we present the results of an active search study of asymptomatic and seroprevalence carriers of SARS - CoV - 2 among high - risk healthcare workers in a hospital in southern Spain .

The study was proposed to the health workers most exposed to direct patient care CoVID - 19 : Emergencies , Intensive Care ( constituted in the crisis situation by personnel from the Intensive Care Unit and Anesthesia and Reanimation ) , Internal Medicine and Pneumology ( plants conventional hospitalization where CoVID patients were admitted ) . Participation in the study was also offered to the Nephrology , Digestive and Cardiology Units , considering them as non - CoVID plants . When the personnel of a certain area began to attend hospitalized CoVID patients , they were considered for the purposes of this study as members of the Internal Medicine and Pneumology area . Voluntary participation was offered to all the members of the referred Units , classifying their professional category in : doctors , nurses , nursing assistants , security guards , administrative and cleaning staff . Workers who had been previously diagnosed with CoVID - 19 were excluded from the study . All the members signed an informed consent and authorization was obtained from the management of the center and the approval of the local Ethics Committee to carry it out . Procedures Naso - oropharyngeal exudates and venous blood samples were taken from each professional . The presence of SARS - CoV - 2 was detected in respiratory samples using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) protocols from 2 providers ( VIASURE SARS - CoV - 2 from CerTest Biotec and LightMix Modular SARS - CoV ( COVID19 ) , Roche ) . RT - PCR tests followed the manufacturer ' s protocols . IgG and IgM antibodies .

On the day of the extraction of samples , a health questionnaire was filled in , informing about the presence of a personal history of interest , symptoms on the same day of the extraction and similar symptoms in the previous 14 days . The collected antecedents were : arterial hypertension , heart failure , ischemic heart disease , chronic lung disease , diabetes mellitus , obesity ( body mass index > 29 ) , chronic kidney failure , asplenia , chronic liver disease , neuromuscular diseases , immunodeficiency and pregnancy . The symptoms for which they were asked both on the day of the extraction and on the previous 14 days were : fever , cough , shortness of breath , runny nose , sore throat , diarrhea , vomiting , headache , myalgia and feeling of general malaise . In addition , they specifically asked about contact with CoVID cases in the worker ' s environment , outside of the workplace , in the previous 14 days . Objectives The main objective was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers of SARS - CoV - 2 in healthcare professionals , defined as those individuals with PCR of a positive respiratory sample without presenting symptoms suggestive of CoVID - 19 on the day of sampling . Secondary objectives were the percentage of individuals with isolated positive IgG , isolated positive IgM or positive IgG and IgM , always with negative PCR . Statistic analysis .

In the case of proportions they are expressed in percentages , while in the case of quantitative variables it is done in means and 95 % CI . Results Characteristics of the participants A total of 498 healthcare workers were recruited , encompassing all the workers in the Emergency , ICU and CoVID - 19 plant areas . The main characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The mean age of the participants was 41 . 5 years ( 95 % CI : 40 . 8 - 42 . 3 ) . Of the total participants , 354 ( 80 % ) were women . The area that contributed the most participants was the CoVID - 19 plant , with 44 % of the total individuals in the sample . The most represented professional category was that of nurses , with 195 ( 39 . 2 % ) participants . Of the personal history , the most frequent was obesity in 88 ( 17 . 7 % ) workers , followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 46 ( 9 . 2 % ) and high blood pressure in 30 cases ( 6 % ) . On the day of sampling , 89 % of the participants did not report any symptoms . Among those who reported symptoms , the main one was headache in 55 cases ( 11 % ) , followed by cough in 50 cases ( 10 % ) , rhinorrhea and sore throat with 40 cases ( 8 % ) for each symptom , only one worker reported fever on the day the samples were taken , which was not observed at the time of collection . In no case were any healthcare workers considered to present a suggestive clinical picture of CoVID - 19 on the day of sampling . When asked about the symptoms present in the previous two weeks , headache was again the most frequent with 116 cases ( 23 . 3 % ) , followed by sore throat in 101 workers ( 20 . 3 % ) and cough in 92 cases ( 18 . 5 % ) . A total of 19 healthcare workers ( 3 . 8 % ) reported contact with CoVID - 19 cases outside the workplace . .

One of them with positive IgG and IgM serology and the other with negative IgG and IgM . They were two nurses from the Emergency Department without any personal record . They had no symptoms on the day of sampling . The healthcare worker with a positive IgG and IgM pattern reported having had diarrhea , general discomfort , and contact with the CoVID - 19 case outside the workplace in the previous fourteen days , so it was probably a paucisymptomatic case with persistent naso CRP positive oropharyngeal . So , only one healthcare worker ( 0 . 2 % ) was a true asymptomatic carrier . Serology results Nine health workers with positive IgG were detected ( 1 . 8 % ) , one of them with a positive PCR . Seven of them ( 1 . 4 % ) had IgG positive with negative IgM and PCR . They included two doctors , a nurse , three nursing assistants , and a warden . By areas , two belonged to the ER , one to Intensive Care , two to the CoVID - 19 plant and the other two to the non - CoVID - 19 plant . None of them reported a background of interest . On the day of the extraction , only one of them reported rhinorrhea as an isolated symptom . In the previous two weeks , one of them reported having presented cough and runny nose , another diarrhea , another headache and two general malaise . In none of these cases was contact with a CoVID - 19 case outside the workplace . Two other workers had positive IgG and IgM . As already mentioned , one of these workers with positive IgG and IgM serology had a positive SARS - Cov - 2 PCR in the naso - oropharynx . The other worker was an intensive care nursing assistant with negative .

Nor did it refer to contact with CoVID - 19 cases outside the workplace . Two more workers ( 0 . 4 % ) presented positive IgM with negative IgG and negative PCR . It was a CoVID - 19 floor doctor and a non - CoVID - 19 floor nurse , with no relevant history . On the day of extraction , one of them reported headache and in the previous two weeks the other worker reported having presented a cough . After 14 days of sampling , both remained asymptomatic . Discussion In this cut - off study in healthcare workers with high occupational exposure , we have detected a percentage of asymptomatic carriers of SARS - CoV - 2 of 0 . 4 % . Actually , one of the two health workers detected as asymptomatic carriers presented a suggestive clinical picture of CoVID - 19 in the two previous weeks , which together with the presence of positive IgG and IgM suggests that it was a CoVID - 19 case with little clinical expression . Thus , true asymptomatic carriers would decrease to 0 . 2 % , with a single case among 498 workers investigated . The percentage of asymptomatic individuals with positive IgG was 1 . 8 % , excluding the worker who presented positive PCR , this percentage would decrease to 1 . 6 % , without any symptoms suggestive of CoVID - 19 being identified in the fourteen days prior to sampling . The percentage of true asymptomatic carriers is considerably lower than that reported in other healthcare centers in our country , with higher incidence rates than those in southern Spain . In a published study that communicates the results of PCR in respiratory samples for SARS - CoV - 2 in a Madrid hospital , it was found that 11 . 9 % of the .

Our hospital treated the first case of CoVID - 19 on February 28 th and the first ill healthcare worker was diagnosed on March 11 . From that day until April 24 , a total of 50 health workers have been diagnosed with CoVID - 19 , constituting 2 . 27 % of the workforce . This difference with respect to the percentage of health workers reported in Madrid and in Spain as a whole , reflects the differences in incidence between Andalusia and the rest of Spain . During the two weeks of the study , the incidence of CoVID - 19 cases in Andalusia remained at around 30 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( 7 ) . The active search for asymptomatic carriers constitutes an additional measure that could affect the limitation of nosocomial transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Nosocomial outbreaks have been reported in residences whose door of entry could have been the presence of an infected worker ( 8 ) and nosocomial transmission has been presumed in up to 29 % of the healthcare workers infected at the start of the pandemic ( 9 ) . In these outbreaks , the presence of asymptomatic carriers reaches more than half of the individuals with positive PCR , although after a few days the truly asymptomatic ones are very rare . This coincides with our finding that , in a hospital care setting that includes CoVID - 19 patients , the proportion of asymptomatic carriers is minimal . This strategy remains one of the weaknesses in the control of the pandemic ( 10 ) , as long as transmission has been described from asymptomatic cases ( 11 , 12 ) . Other screening strategies based on typical symptoms of CoVID - 19 in healthcare workers have shown that about 20 % of individuals with positive PCR would not have been detected if the criteria had not been extended to the presence of nonspecific symptoms ( 13 ) . It also constitutes a control measure that is likely to reduce the anxiety of health personnel , .

In this sense , local worker protection policies may have influenced both the percentage of sick workers and that of asymptomatic carriers to be small . Regarding serology , some authors point it out as an important tool in pandemic control ( 15 ) . Its use has allowed establishing epidemiological relationships between different clusters , since it would identify past infections ( 16 ) . In any case , adding individuals with positive IgG or IgM as past infections , would represent a small percentage of the total of our sample . However , the sensitivity and specificity of the serology by immunochromatography technique do not seem superior to the immunoassay ( 17 ) , especially in asymptomatic individuals and in areas of low prevalence , so these results should be interpreted with caution . A clear limitation of our work is the sensitivity of naso and oropharyngeal PCR , limited to less than 70 % in admitted symptomatic patients ( 18 ) . There is the theoretical possibility that there was some other undetected carrier , although in any case in our casuistry it should be accidental . It is worth noting that in the areas of greatest exposure ( Emergencies , Intensive Care and the CoVID plant ) the recruitment of health workers was 100 % . Our experience reflects the status of these workers at a certain epidemiological moment , one month after the Spanish Government decreed confinement measures throughout the country , so it is not possible to extrapolate it to other times such as the start of the pandemic in Spain . On the other hand , the study began to be designed in early March , so the presence of anosmia or agueusia was not included in the health questionnaire , but was not included later . In conclusion , the percentage of asymptomatic healthcare workers with SARS - CoV - 2 in our hospital center in the units with the highest occupational exposure has .
