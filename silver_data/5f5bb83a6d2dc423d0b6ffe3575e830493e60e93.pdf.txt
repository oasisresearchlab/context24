Proximity labeling proteomics ( PLP ) strategies using chemically reactive probes are powerful approaches to yield snapshots of protein neighborhoods but are currently limited to one single resolution based on the probe labeling radius . Here , we describe a multi - scale PLP method with tunable resolution using a commercially available histological dye , Eosin Y , which upon visible light illumination , activates three different photo - probes with labeling radii ranging from ~ 100 to 3000 Å . We applied this platform to profile neighborhoods of the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and orthogonally validated > 20 neighbors using immuno - assays and AlphaFold - Multimer prediction that generated plausible binary interaction models . We further profiled the protein neighborhoods of cell - cell synapses induced by bi - specific T - cell engagers ( BiTEs ) and chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cells at longer length scales . This integrated multi - scale PLP platform maps local and distal protein networks on cell surfaces and between cells . We believe this information will aid in the systematic construction of the cell surface interactome and reveal new opportunities for immunotherapeutics . Main text : Introduction : Cell surface proteins are critical mediators of information , nutrients , and functions on cells and between them . The extracellular proteome , both secreted and membrane - bound , is encoded by more than 25 % of the human genome ( 1 , 2 ) . Proteomics methods have made great strides in characterizing the composition of the surface proteome in health and disease models ( 3 , 4 ) . However , we know much less about the protein - protein interactions formed on the cell membrane , especially transient interactions that regulate cell signaling networks . Proximity labeling proteomics ( PLP ) methods have enabled the identification of protein interactomes in complex cellular environments ( 5 , 6 ) . These methods typically generate a single reactive intermediate locally to label and profile nearby proteins using imaging or proteomics . The first generation of PLP methods used genetically encoded enzymes such as APEX ( 7 ) , BioID ( 8 ) or TurboID ( 9 , 10 ) to produce phenoxyl radicals or activated AMP that have long reactive half - lives ( t 1 / 2 > 100 µsec ) . These methods are well - suited for characterizing cell - cell and organelle - specific interactomes given their long labeling range up to 3000 Å by labeling electron - rich amino acids ( 11 ) . Singlet oxygen generators ( SOG ) triggers selective labeling on His ( 12 ) at a shorter range given the shorter half - life of singlet oxygen in water ( ~ 2 - 4 µ s ) ( 13 ) . However , proteins are estimated to be separated by only 60 - 70 Å on the crowded cell surface ( 14 ) , thus making it challenging to identify the most proximal protein neighbors using long - range PLP approaches . Most recently , PLP methods of very short range have emerged , enabling higher resolution mapping including µMap ( 15 - 17 ) . These designs employ transition - metal or other photocatalysts attached to antibodies to trigger reactive intermediate with shorter half - lives such as carbenes or nitrenes ( t 1 / 2 ~ 2 and 10 ns , respectively ) ( 11 , 18 ) . Activation of these probes enables labeling proteins at a significantly shorter range of ~ 100 - 700 Å as well as broader amino acid coverage ( 11 , 19 ) , thus making it much more appropriate for nearest neighborhood analysis ( 20 - 23 ) . Collectively , the suite of PLP methods can cover a broad length scale for labeling protein neighborhoods and synapses but require multiple photocatalysts for adjustable resolution . Here , we report a multi - scale photocatalytic PLP technology , termed MultiMap ( Fig . 1A ) that allows short - , intermediate - , and long - range labeling from a single photocatalyst , Eosin Y ( EY ) . We discovered that EY , a fluorescent dye commonly used in food chemistry and biological staining ( 21 ) can efficiently trigger the generation of carbene , nitrene , singlet oxygen and phenoxyl radicals from photo - probes with bio - compatible blue or green light . We applied MultiMap to profile high - resolution neighborhoods of the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in different cellular contexts . We identified > 20 neighbors and further validated their interactions via immunoprecipitation and in silico prediction models using AlphaFold - Multimer ( 24 ) . We demonstrated that MultiMap can capture long - range intercellular engagements between cancer cells and T lymphocytes induced by bi - specific T - cell engagers ( BiTEs ) and engineered chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ) . Our data show that MultiMap is an effective multi - scale PLP technology that can characterize local and distal cellular interactomes from a single photocatalyst . We believe that with artificial intelligence - assisted structural prediction methods integrated , the MultiMap workflow will be an important approach in the broad quest to define the spatial organization of the cell surface proteome and to reveal new drug discovery opportunities . Results : Eosin Y ( EY ) activates a panel of photo - probes for protein labeling . We explored Eosin Y ( EY ) for PLP ( Fig . 1A ) based on its photocatalytic ability broadly used in polymer synthesis ( 25 ) and easy commercial access ( 26 ) . In contrast , the current transition - metal photocatalysts used in µMap , such as { Ir [ dF ( CF 3 ) ppy ] 2 ( dtbbpy ) } PF 6 , requires lengthy synthetic routes ( 15 , 27 ) . We first compared EY to the Ir - catalyst for photo - induced hydrolysis of the diazirine via LC - MS and observed 100 % quantitative hydrolysis with 10 min blue LED illumination ( l = 450 nm , fig . S1A ) . The absorption peak for EY ( l max = 517 nm , fig . S1B ) is significantly red - shifted compared with the Ir - catalyst ( l max = 420 nm ) ( 15 ) , which could make EY more bio - compatible ( 28 ) . Indeed , green LED illumination ( l = 525 nm ) of EY induced 100 % diazirine hydrolysis , whereas the iridium catalyst did not induce any detectable conversion ( fig . S1A ) . Erythrosin B ( l max = 535 nm ) , a dye structurally similar to EY , photo - catalyzed 31 % hydrolysis of the diazirine with blue LED illumination and 100 % with green LED illumination , indicating that the EY scaffold can be modified for specific photochemical properties . We next tested the ability of EY to label bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) using a diazirine - biotin probe in the presence of light ( Fig . 1B ) . We observed time - and light - dependent accumulation of biotinylated BSA via Western blot ( WB ) analysis ; labeling plateaued within 6 min of blue LED illumination ( Fig . 1B left ) . A pulse - light experiment ( Fig . 1B right ) demonstrated that the catalytic function of EY is light - dependent . EY is structurally similar to other photocatalysts that can trigger aryl - azide and phenol probes ( 26 , 29 , 30 ) . EY fully converted the aryl - azide probe to the aniline upon blue LED illumination ( fig . S1C ) . We then tested the photocatalytic labeling on BSA by WB analysis and found that EY efficiently catalyzed biotin labeling in the presence of either aryl - azide - biotin or phenol - biotin ( Fig . 1C and fig . S1D - F ) . Additionally , we evaluated the ability of EY to induce singlet - oxygen - based labeling using biocytin - hydrazide ( 12 ) and observed efficient light - dependent labeling . The extents of labeling of BSA among the four biotin - containing reactive probes , which we refer to as photo - probes , ranged in the following order : aryl - azide - biotin ( > 95 % ) , biocytin - hydrazide ( ~ 80 % ) , phenol - biotin ( ~ 15 % ) and diazirine - biotin ( ~ 2 % ) ( fig . S1D - E ) . Under blue light illumination , the Ir catalyst could trigger labeling of BSA by the aryl - azide - biotin but not the phenol - biotin ( fig . S1D - E ) . EY also efficiently catalyzed labeling of BSA with green LED while the Ir catalyst showed no labeling ( fig . S1F ) . More than 80 % labeling of BSA was achieved upon 3 min green LED exposure of EY with all four photo - probes . We also found that EY maintains its photocatalytic function above its pKa ( pH = 3 . 5 ) ( fig . S1G - H ) ( 26 ) and thus is compatible with labeling across a wide range of physiologic pH conditions . Fig . 1 . MultiMap captures high - resolution snapshots of biological networks across a wide range of length scales . ( A ) A schematic of the MultiMap workflow . EY is conjugated to an antibody that binds the target of interest ( e . g . , Fab arm of Ctx bound to the EGFR extracellular domain ) . Upon illumination , proteins are biotinylated , captured and digested for MS analysis . Proteomics hits are further examined by immunoprecipitation and predictive structural analysis via AlphaFold - Multimer . MultiMap is a useful platform for profiling local membrane protein interactomes both on live cells and between cell - cell synapses . ( B ) WB showing EY - mediated photocatalytic biotinylation of BSA by a diazirine - biotin probe upon blue LED illumination . Biotinylation can be controlled temporally by pulsed light . ( C ) EY triggers labeling of BSA with all three photo - probes ( diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin ) , but Ir only activates the first two . All immunoblot images are representative of at least two biological replicates . Conjugation of EY onto proteins . We evaluated different conjugation methods for EY first onto BSA and then to antibodies ( Fig . 2A and fig . S2A ) . After synthesizing DBCO - PEG 4 - EY via an amine - isothiocyanate reaction ( Scheme 1 ) , we explored the conjugation efficiency and stoichiometry for attaching a click - compatible azido functionality specifically to Lys , Met or Cys using N - hydroxy succinimide ( NHS ) ester , oxaziridine , or maleimide / iodoacetamide warheads , respectively ( fig . S2B ) . EY - conjugation via NHS - azide ligation produced the most efficient conjugation ; conjugated EY also efficiently catalyzed BSA self - biotinylation with diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin ( fig . S2B - C ) . Next , we conjugated EY to cetuximab ( Ctx ) , an FDA - approved antibody that selectively binds EGFR and competes for epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) binding , thus turning - off EGFR signaling and cell proliferation in cancer ( Fig . 2B ) ( 31 , 32 ) . Ctx does not have Lys , Met or Cys residues in the CDRs or in the contact epitope with the EGFR ectodomain ( ECD , aa 1 - 645 , PDB : 1YY9 ) ( 31 ) , suggesting all bioconjugation methods are viable without impairing binding . We tested the same panel of bioconjugation warheads on Ctx , generating similar levels of conjugation as seen for BSA ( fig . S2D ) . Quantification of the levels of conjugation by WB analysis or EY absorption indicated that a stoichiometry of eight and two EY catalysts were installed per Ctx - NHS - EY and Ctx - Ox - EY , respectively ( fig . S2E - F ) . We then tested the intra - and inter - molecular labeling of the Ctx - EY conjugates with equimolar amounts of recombinant human EGFR ectodomain ( ECD , aa 1 - 645 ) and in competition with EGF ( Fig . 2C ) . 1 µM Ctx - NHS - EY or Ctx - Ox - EY was mixed with 1 µM EGFR - ECD with or without pre - incubation with 1 µM EGF . 100 µM diazirine - biotin was added and the mixture was illuminated with blue LED for 10 minutes . Proteins were purified via acetone precipitation and immunoblotted to evaluate the labeling efficiency ( Fig . 2C ) . Both Ctx - NHS - EY and Ctx - Ox - EY conjugates demonstrated self - labeling in a light - dependent manner . Not surprisingly , there was a higher degree of biotinylation with Ctx - NHS - EY which contains ~ 4 - fold more conjugated EY than Ctx - Ox - EY ( fig . S2D ) . Intermolecular EGFR labeling with both EY - conjugated constructs occurred in a light - dependent manner ( Fig . 2C ) , indicating that the conjugation of EY did not interfere with Ctx binding to EGFR as expected . Pre - incubation of EGF prevented labeling , demonstrating that direct binding is necessary for target labeling ( Fig . 2C ) . To explore the generality of the workflow , we performed the same NHS and oxaziridine bioconjugation and labeling using a trastuzumab ( Trz ) Fab that binds the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor ( fig . S3A ) . Similar intermolecular labeling of HER2 was observed with Trz - NHS - EY or Trz - Ox - EY in a light - dependent manner . The demonstration of EGFR and HER2 labeling in vitro supports the broad applicability of the bioconjugation strategy and photo - probe labeling workflow . We chose to focus on the NHS - azide conjugate ( abbreviated to Ctx - EY ) given its higher bioconjugation and photo - probe labeling efficiency . We evaluated the EGFR labeling efficiencies with diazirine - , aryl - azide - , and phenol - biotin photo - probes in parallel ( Fig . 2D ) . All three probes labeled the EGFR ECD to increasing levels : aryl - azide - biotin > phenol - biotin > diazirine - biotin . The differing yields likely result from the combined effects of the reactive radical intermediates : half - lives ( phenol > > aryl - azide > diazirine ) , yield of reaction with protein ( phenol > aryl - azide > diazirine ) , and broad amino - acid preference observed ( diazirine ~ aryl - azide > > phenol ) ( fig . S3B ) ( 33 - 35 ) . We analyzed the specific sites of biotinylation for self - labeling of BSA and binary complex labeling of Ctx and EGFR with different photo - probes using MS analysis ( Table S1 - 8 and fig . S3B - C ) . For diazirine - biotin , we found 17 biotinylated sites on BSA ( Table S1 ) , and 30 sites on the Ctx - EGFR complex ( Table S5 ) , with good coverage of modified peptides over the light and heavy chains of Ctx , as well as EGFR ECD ( Fig . 2E and fig . S3C ) . We further characterized the modification sites on BSA and Ctx - EGFR systems for the other probes ( Table S1 - 8 and fig . S3B - C ) . As expected , phenol - biotin mostly labeled Tyr / Trp , while labeling with biocytin - hydrazide was found exclusively on His . Diazirine - biotin and aryl - azide - biotin showed very broad amino acid preference , consistent with previous reports ( 19 , 34 ) . Fig . 2 . Targeted labeling using antibody - EY conjugates in vitro . ( A ) Synthetic scheme of Ctx - EY via a two - step bioconjugation workflow . An azido functionality was first introduced onto either Lys or Met residues using NHS or oxaziridine chemistry , respectively , followed by bio - orthogonal click reaction to couple EY . ( B ) Schematic design to test intra - and inter - biotinylation of Ctx - EY and EGFR with or without EGF competition . ( C ) Targeted EGFR biotinylation with the diazirine - biotin photo - probe when triggered by either Ctx - NHS - EY ( Ctx - EY ) or Ctx - Ox - EY in vitro . Both conjugates selectively label EGFR in a light - dependent fashion , which is competed off by exogenous EGF . ( D ) EGFR is biotinylated by all three photo - probes : diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin or phenol - biotin using Ctx - EY . ( E ) Biotinylation sites of diazirine - biotin ( yellow ) , aryl - azide - biotin ( cyan ) , phenol - biotin ( maroon ) and biocytin - hydrazide ( purple ) highlighted on the crystal structure of the EGFR ECD ( grey ) in complex with Ctx Fab ( blue ) ( PDB : 1YY9 , data taken from Table S5 - 8 ) . All immunoblot images are representative of at least two biological replicates . Ctx - EY catalyzes targeted labeling of EGFR on cells . We next evaluated the ability of Ctx - EY to bind EGFR and label live cells ( Fig . 3A ) . First , we incubated the Ctx - EY conjugate with an epithelial skin cancer cell line , A431 cells , that endogenously expresses very high levels of wild - type EGFR ( nTPM = 2978 ) ( 36 ) . On - cell binding for the Ctx - conjugates , both Ctx - EY and Ctx - Ir , was confirmed via flow cytometry showing that the conjugation of EY or the Ir - catalyst did not affect binding ( Fig 3B ) . Detailed titration from 1 nM to 10 µ M of Ctx and Ctx - EY analyzed via flow cytometry further confirmed conjugation did not detectably affect cell binding ( Fig . 3B and fig . S4A ) . We also tested A549 cells with more typical levels of EGFR ( 37 ) ( nTPM = 59 . 7 , fig . S4B ) as well as NCI - H441 cells with very low EGFR expression ( nTPM = 29 . 8 , fig . S4C ) , both of which showed proportionally reduced binding of Ctx - EY and was similar to Ctx . We next performed on - cell proximity labeling with diazirine - , aryl - azide - and phenol - biotin photo - probes upon blue LED illumination ( Fig . 3D and fig S5A - D ) . We tested a range of Ctx - EY concentrations and observed efficient biotinylation on cells at 100 nM ( Fig . 3D and fig . S5A ) . The diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide biotin , and phenol - biotin labeling caused a major shift of biotinylation in the flow cytometry profile of 64 % , 98 % , and 94 % , respectively . This is consistent with the order of labeling efficiencies observed in vitro . The Ctx - Ir only activated cell biotinylation with diazirine - biotin and aryl - azide - biotin and not phenol - biotin ( fig . S5B ) . We further visualized cell biotinylation induced by Ctx - EY via confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3E and fig . S5E - F ) . The labeled A431 , A549 and NCI - H441 cells were co - stained with both anti - human IgG - AlexFluor488 and streptavidin - AlexaFluor647 to visualize Ctx and biotinylation , respectively . We confirmed that the Ctx - EY conjugate was located on the cell membrane . Biotinylation using the diazirine - and aryl - azide - biotin photo - probes were observed mainly on the cell membrane , whereas the phenol - biotin labeling was more diffuse , consistent with the longer half - life and labeling range of the phenoxyl radical . Fig . 3 . Ctx - EY enables EGFR - dependent labeling on cells with different photo - probes . ( A ) General on - cell labeling workflow using Ctx - EY conjugate and detection of biotin labeling using fluorescent streptavidin - AF647 . ( B ) Cellular binding assay of 100 nM Ctx , Ctx - EY or Ctx - Ir conjugates on A431 cells via flow cytometry analysis shows similar on - cell binding . ( C , D ) Quantitative on - cell binding ( C ) and on - cell labeling ( D ) with diazirine - , aryl - azide - and phenol - biotin triggered by 100 nM Ctx - EY on A431 cells via flow cytometry analysis . ( E ) Confocal microscopy imaging of antibody binding and on - cell biotinylation of Ctx - EY on A431 cells shows labeling mostly confined to cell surface . Scale bar = 20 µm . We next developed a proteomics workflow to label the EGFR neighborhood ( Fig 4A ) , focusing first on A431 cells with highest levels of EGFR and using the most reactive diazirine - biotin photo - probe . We incubated A431 cells with or without EGF competition first and then performed the on - cell biotinylation workflow using Ctx - EY , followed by biotin enrichment using neutravidin beads . WB analysis confirmed selective biotinylation of EGFR which was ablated in the presence of EGF ( Fig . 4B ) . We also observed dose - dependent EGFR labeling over a wide range of Ctx - EY concentrations of 1 - 1000 nM , which was competed off by either EGF or unlabeled Ctx ( fig . S6A ) . Cells were treated with Ctx - EY in the presence or absence of EGF competition and biotinylated proteins were captured on neutravidin beads and digested on - bead with trypsin . Samples were prepared in biological triplicate for MS analysis using label - free quantitation ( volcano plot shown in Fig . 4C , heatmap shown in Fig . S6B ) . We identified a total of 536 proteins with 41 proteins enriched by more than two - fold with Ctx - EY relative to EGF competition ( log 2 ( ratio ) ≥ 1 , p - value < 0 . 05 , unique peptide ≥ 2 ; Table S9 and Fig . S6C - D ) . EGFR was among the highly enriched as expected . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis showed a significant representation of biological processes that include regulation of phosphatase activity as well as molecular function entities such as phosphatase activator activity ( fig . S6D ) . These features are consistent with the functional roles of EGFR signaling and suggest that the enriched EGFR interactors are accurately represented . We orthogonally confirmed that six top hits were biotinylated by biotin - IP , where streptavidin pull - down samples were analyzed by WB using specific antibodies following proximity labeling ( Fig . 4D ) . Among them , five were observed to co - IP with EGFR ( Fig . 4D ) . All six proteins are known to either functionally interact with EGFR or found in immunoprecipitation experiments ( 38 - 40 ) . These include ITB1 , which is critical for stable maintenance for EGFR on the cell membrane ( 41 , 42 ) , as well as macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) , an immunostimulatory cytokine regulated by matrix metalloproteinase 13 ( MMP13 ) known to be inhibitory for EGFR activation ( 43 ) . Others include substrates of EGFR such as glutathione S - transferase P1 GSTP1 ( 44 ) and tight junction protein ZO1 ( 45 ) , both of which are known to be activated upon phosphorylation by EGFR . One target membrane - associated progesterone receptor component 1 , PGRC1 , was not observed in EGFR co - IP experiment , and we would expect that some interactions may not be strong enough to survive the co - IP workup in these cells .

( C ) Volcano plot of Ctx - EY - mediated labeling of EGFR with or without EGF on A431 cells using diazirine - biotin . 41 significantly enriched proteins ( log 2 ( ratio ) ≥ 1 , p - value < 0 . 05 , unique peptide ≥ 2 , n = 3 ) are highlighted in red and listed in Table S9 . ( D ) Enrichment ratios for six top protein hits are displayed . Full heatmap is presented in fig . S6B and Table S9 . All six proteins were confirmed to be biotinylated using biotin - IP blots , and five were selectively enriched in a separate EGFR co - IP experiment . All immunoblot images are representative of at least two biological replicates . Multi - scale EGFR interactome profiled via MultiMap . Having demonstrated the proteomic workflow of Ctx - EY triggered biotinylation on cells expressing high levels of EGFR , we expanded to cells expressing modest levels of EGFR . Lung cancer cell line , A549 , for example , express lower amounts of EGFR ( nTPM = 59 . 7 ) , which is more typical of native membrane proteins ( 37 ) . We applied all photo - probes and showed EGFR was selectively biotinylated with each probe ( fig . S7A ) . Applying the proteomics workflow , we then identified EGFR neighbors enriched with diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin by comparing labeling with Ctx - EY in the absence and presence of EGF ( Fig . 5A ) . We found that EGFR is one of the most enriched proteins from all three datasets ( Table S10 - 12 ) . Enriched proteins were identified with the same statistical thresholds [ log 2 ( ratio ) ≥ 1 , p - value < 0 . 05 , unique peptide ≥ 2 ] , allowing us to compare protein identities across reactions with different photo - probes . We identified 72 proteins using diazirine - biotin , 188 using aryl - azide - biotin , and 188 using phenol - biotin ( Tables S10 - 12 and fig . S7B - D ) . As represented in a Venn diagram ( Fig . 5B ) , there were a total of 322 unique proteins enriched over the controls in at least one of the three photo - probes . The aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin labeled more proteins than diazirine - biotin reflecting their higher yields and their relatively long labeling radii . We found that > 80 % of the enriched proteins were annotated as plasma membrane proteins in UniProt ( plasma membrane , GO : 0005886 ) for all three photo - probes . GO enrichment analysis suggested molecular functions such as EGFR activity and EGF binding were highly enriched ( fig . S7D ) . Sixteen candidate neighbors were identified in all three datasets of MultiMap ( Fig . 5B ) . While no direct structural evidence has been reported for EGFR with any of these , CD44 and Galectin - 3 have been functionally associated with EGFR : CD44 regulates EGFR functions in the presence of CD147 and hyaluronan ( 46 , 47 ) ; Galectin - 3 regulates EGFR localization and its interactions suggested through genetic studies in pancreatic cancers ( 48 ) . Both targets were further validated by biotin - IP and EGFR co - IP ( Fig . 5C ) , supporting that they are proximal neighbors of EGFR . We next expanded our list to the 29 proteins that were in common for diazirine - biotin and aryl - azide - biotin , the photo - probes with high labeling resolutions ( Fig . 5B ) . Among them , we found a paraoxonase , PON2 , as well as two proteins associated with RTK phosphorylation and activation : beta - adducin ADDB and MAP kinase pathway member BRAF ( 49 , 50 ) . Both PON2 and ADDB were detected by biotin - IP and EGFR co - IP . Interestingly , BRAF , a cytosolic protein was enriched by biotin - IP but not EGFR co - IP suggesting it is close but may not be in physical contact ( Fig . 5D and fig . S7E ) . Between the diazirine and aryl - azide datasets , we identified the known EGFR functional interactors such as Tid1 ( 51 ) and ITB1 also found in the A431 cell experiments ( 33 , 34 ) , as well as previously unreported interaction partners including CKAP4 and RAC1 ( fig . S7E ) . The aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin experiments contributed more proteins ( 293 in total ) . Among the top hits were the tyrosine - protein phosphatase receptor , PTPRF , glutathione transferase GSTP1 , small GTPase Rab11a , Rho - related GTP binding protein RHOC and ESCRT protein PDC6I ( Fig . 5E and fig . S7E ) . Remarkably , all were detected by biotin - IP with ten out of eleven of these proteins co - IPed with EGFR , suggesting that they form relatively stable complexes . To provide a structural level of analysis , we turned to AlphaFold - Multimer , an exciting extension of AlphaFold developed over the last few years that uses artificial intelligence to generate plausible models of binary protein complexes ( 24 , 52 , 53 ) . This community has developed scoring metrics such a predicted DockQ score ( pDockQ ) , where a threshold of > 0 . 23 retrieves 51 % of true - positive interacting proteins with a false - positive rate of ~ 1 % in large test set models ( 54 ) . Additional criteria can be applied including buried solvent accessible surface area ( BSASA ) ≥ 500Å 2 ( 55 , 56 ) , predicted local distance difference test ( pLDDT ) > 50 for the interface residues and minimum predicted alignment error ( PAE ) < 15 Å as described previously ( 52 ) . As a true positive example , we derived an AlphaFold - Multimer model of the EGF : EGFR complex ( fig . S8A and Table S13 ) that closely overlaid that of the known structure of EGF : EGFR ( PDB : 1IVO , RMSD between 469 atom pairs is 0 . 924 Å ) ( 57 ) . We applied AlphaFold - Multimer to candidate neighbors validated by biotin - IP and / or EGFR co - IP in A431 and A549 cells and generated a total of 29 models . As shown in waterfall plots , the average pDockQ score ( 0 . 298 ) and BSASA ( 1466Å 2 ) for the 29 EGFR - protein pairs were both above the established criteria suggesting direct interactions ( fig . S8B and Table S13 ) . We next applied AlphaFold - Multimer to compute models of all potential heterodimeric complexes from Fig . 4C and Fig . 5A ( Table S13 ) . To increase the accuracy of the models for transmembrane proteins ( 58 ) , we calculated separately the ECD ( aa 1 - 646 ) and intracellular domain ( ICD , aa 695 - 1022 ) of EGFR and paired them with the corresponding ECDs or ICDs of transmembrane protein targets . As previously described , we retained only high - confidence AlphaFold - Multimer models [ average pLDDT > 50 , minimum predicted Alignment Error ( PAE ) < 15Å ] ( 52 ) and performed further filtering using the aforementioned criteria [ pDockQ score ≥ 0 . 23 , BSASA ≥ 500 Å 2 ] . The final list of validated complexes included the binary complexes of EGFR ECD with CD44 ECD ( aa 1 - 153 , pDockQ = 0 . 375 ) , PON2 ( pDockQ = 0 . 372 ) and MIF ( aa 1 - 115 , pDockQ = 0 . 375 ) ( Fig . 5F and fig . S8C - F ) . In addition , the ICD of EGFR is predicted to bind Rab11a ( pDockQ = 0 . 264 ) , GSTP1 ( pDockQ = 0 . 535 ) and RAC1 ( pDockQ = 0 . 387 ) ( Fig . 5F and fig . S9A - C ) . Most interestingly , one of the AlphaFold - Multimer complexes predicted with the highest confidence is a cell - surface phosphatase PTPRF , where PTPRF ECD binds EGFR ECD ( pDockQ = 0 . 429 ) and likewise , the PTPRF ICD binds the EGFR ICD ( pDockQ = 0 . 476 ) ( Fig . 5F down ) .

( E ) Enrichment ratios and validation of protein hits from both aryl - azide - biotin and / or phenol - biotin datasets . ( F ) AlphaFold - Multimer predictions of EGFR complexes confirmed the direct interactions of EGFR with interactors found via MultiMap . EGFR ECD or ICD ( blue ) is shown in complex with the corresponding interactor protein ( yellow or orange - yellow for the ones interacting with EGFR ECD , green for the ones interacting with EGFR ICD ) along with the pDockQ scores and BSASA . All immunoblot images are representative of at least two biological replicates . MultiMap can capture distal synaptic protein networks . Extracellular protein - protein interactions occur not only in cis on the cell membrane but also in trans between cell - cell junctions . To explore PLP of cell synapses using MultiMap at different labeling radii , we assembled a co - culture system where the cell - cell interaction was induced by a bispecific T cell engager ( BiTE ) ( Fig . 6A ) . This BiTE contained the Ctx Fab genetically fused to an α - CD3 scFv ( OKT3 ) ( 59 ) . Two different cells were utilized in the co - culture system : a HEK293T cell was engineered in house to overexpress a Flag - tagged - EGFR ( HEK - Flag - EGFR ) and well - established Jurkat cells expressing a NFAT - GFP reporter ( 60 ) . In this design , the Flag tag served as an orthogonal ecto - epitope for an EY - conjugated α - Flag nanobody ( α - Flag - EY ) , thus allowing selectively recognition of Flag - tagged EGFR . In order to separately characterize the labeling on HEK - Flag - EGFR and Jurkat NFAT - GFP cells , we used α - CD3 - PE signal to allow facile separation of CD3 + Jurkat cells from CD3 - HEK - Flag - EGFR . Levels of cis - and trans - labeling from α - Flag - EY were determined by flow cytometry . Proteins labeled with different photo - probes were enriched using streptavidin beads and analyzed by WB ( Fig . 6A ) . We first monitored BiTE engagement between HEK - Flag - EGFR and Jurkat NFAT - GFP cells using the standard GFP reporter gene readout . As expected , we observed dose - dependent BiTE activation of cell - cell engagement , with the GFP signal shifted to 80 . 3 % in the presence of 8 nM EGFR BiTE and 92 . 3 % with 50 nM BiTE ( Fig . S10A ) . The GFP signal shift was not affected by the presence of α - Flag - EY , indicating that the Flag tag recognition did not interfere with the cell synapse engagement . We then performed the MultiMap workflow using four photo - probes of increasing labeling range : diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin , biocytin - hydrazide and phenol - biotin . We monitored biotinylation in cis for HEK - Flag - EGFR and in trans for Jurkat NFAT - GFP using a streptavidin - AlexaFluor647 signal ( Fig . 6A and fig . S10B - C ) . Cis - labeling of HEK - Flag - EGFR cells occurred for > 60 % of cells for the diazirin - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin with ~ 29 % for the biocytin hydrazide ( fig . S10B ) . In sharp contrast , minimal shift ( ~ 3 - 4 % ) was observed on control HEK - EGFR cells without the Flag tag , suggesting that α - Flag - EY is selectively recognizing the Flag tag . Interestingly , the trans - labeling of the Jurkat cells using the shorter - range diazirine - biotin , aryl - azide - biotin was limited to 3 - 4 % ( fig . S10C ) , while the intermediate - range biocytin - hydrazide and long - range phenol - biotin labeled 9 % and 22 % , respectively ) ( Fig . 6A and fig . S10C ) . This is consistent with the cell - cell synapse distance based on the length of the Fab - ScFv BiTE ( 61 ) , plus the size of the EGFR ECD and the CD3 complex . By further analysis via WB , the cis - target EGFR was observed enriched by biotin - IP in the presence of the three photo - probes , whereas trans - target CD3 was only significantly enriched in the phenol - biotin sample , with moderate amount observed in the aryl - azide - biotin - labeled sample ( Fig . 6A ) . Thus , longer - range photo - probes are more efficient for trans - labeling . To further expand the generality of MultiMap for cell - cell synapses , we tested the BiTE system to two other cancer targets , HER2 and CDCP1 ( Fig . 6B and fig . S11A - E ) . We fused α - HER2 Fab sequence ( Trz Fab , fig . S10A - C ) and a previously generated α - CDCP1 Fab ( 4A06 ) ( Fig . 6B - C and fig . S11D - E ) ( 59 ) onto the CD3 scFv scaffold . Again , we observed dose - dependent cell - cell engagement in the presence of the engineered BiTEs and antigen - expressing cells ( fig . S11B and fig . S11D ) . On - cell biotinylation results were similar to the EGFR BiTE system ; cis - labeling was found with all three photo - probes and trans - labeling activated primarily with phenol - biotin ( fig . S10C and fig . S11E ) . In particular , by separating HEK293T - CDCP1 and Jurkat - NFAT - GFP cells , we confirmed selective biotinylation of CDCP1 with all three photo - probes , and CD3 only with phenol - biotin ( Fig . 6B ) . We quantitatively profiled the proteins captured at the cell synapse of HEK - Flag - CDCP1 and Jurkat NFAT - GFP in biological triplicate ( Fig . 6C , Table S14 ) . We discovered that CDCP1 was enriched in the cis - labeled samples . Proteins from the CD3 complex including CD3 d and CD3 e were highly enriched in the trans - labeled samples . This observation indicates that interactome in the cell - cell synapse can be captured by the MultiMap workflow . Lastly , we evaluated MultiMap labeling at a ( CAR ) T cell - cell synapse ( Fig . 6D and fig . S11F - G ) . Jurkat cells expressing a Myc - tagged CAR construct ( Jurkat - CAR ) that targets CD19 were mixed with K562 cancer cells expressing CD19 ectodomain ( K562 - CD19 ) . With an EY - conjugated α - myc antibody ( α - myc - EY ) , we performed our workflow by introducing cis - labeling on K562 - CD19 and trans - labeling on Jurkat - CAR cells . We confirmed cell engagement by monitoring the CAR activation with or without K562 cells ( fig . S11F ) . We observed cis - labeling on interacting CAR cells with all photo - probes ( fig . S11G ) . On the other hand , both aryl - azide - biotin and phenol - biotin achieved trans - labeling , with much lower level of biotinylation using the short - range diazirine - biotin ( Fig . 6E ) . The same results were confirmed by WB analysis ( Fig . 6F ) . These results are in line with the estimate of cell - cell distance between CAR - induced synapse at ~ 120 Å according to AlphaFold prediction ( 62 ) , which is shorter than BiTE - induced synapse . We finally sorted each cell type for proteomics analysis and found both CD19 and CD3 component enriched for trans - labeling and cis - labeling ( Fig . 6F and Tables S15 ) . Taken together , our data suggests that MultiMap can label cells at the cell - cell synapses and map the proteins in proximity via PLP . Only minimal alternation to the existing workflow is needed for labeling in different cell - cell engagement scenarios . Looking forward , we anticipate that this platform will be a useful technology to identify key proteins in different synaptic environments . Fig . 6 . MultiMap enables targeted snapshots of local cell - cell synapses . ( A ) On - cell labeling of the T - cell synapse using a bispecific T cell engager ( BiTE ) that recognizes EGFR . Jurkat NFAT - GFP and HEK293T - Flag - EGFR were co - cultured in the presence of the BiTE before MultiMap was performed using an EY - conjugated α - Flag nanobody ( α - Flag - EY ) .

Discussion : Here we demonstrate a multi - scale PLP technology , MultiMap , that enables proximity labeling and interactome profiling with adjustable resolution depending on the half - life of the photo - probe using a single photocatalyst EY . EY is a unique photocatalyst in its ability to trigger a broad range of photo - probes . It is commercially available , bio - compatible , and shown to be readily conjugated to seven different proteins and antibodies by commonly accessible methods . Simple targeting by EY - conjugated antibodies obviates the need for cell engineering . EY - mediated labeling is rapid and light - dependent , which potentially allows kinetic control of the labeling . Future structure - activity relationship studies on EY , as done for rhodamine - or fluorescein - based scaffolds ( 63 ) , could enhance our understanding of the photochemical mechanisms of EY , as well as improve its spectral properties , activation efficiency , and use in tissues ( 20 , 27 ) . Coupled with standard biochemical validation and the recently developed AlphaFold - Multimer algorithm for structural prediction ( 24 ) , the MultiMap proximity labeling proteomics workflow provides three orthogonal and integrated pillars for high - resolution profiling of protein neighborhoods . In addition to identification of new potential neighbors , we detected many proteins known to functionally interact with EGFR that are reported to stabilize , modulate , or act as substrates for EGFR . One of the most striking targets identified was the phosphatase , PTPRF , which could be a functional off - switch for EGFR . Interestingly , AlphaFold - Multimer predicts the ECD of PTPRF binds the back side of the EGFR ECD away from the dimer interface , and that the ICD of the phosphatase binds to the intracellular kinase domain of EGFR . Despite the fact that EY - antibodies recognize extracellular targets , we found that some of the high - confidence hits were intracellular proteins . Some are known to functionally associate with EGFR , for which high - confidence AlphaFold - Multimer binary models were constructed . It is not impossible that the labeling is caused by cell penetrance of the activated photo - probe when triggered by EY . We believe future work could fine - tune the properties of photo - probes such as charge and hydrophobicity to achieve extracellular - only or organelle - specific labeling . It is unlikely that all these identified neighbors bind simultaneously to EGFR . In fact , some proteins are predicted to bind over the same sites . These data suggest EGFR can be in multiple neighborhoods which are dynamic and may have multiple functions yet to be revealed . It is also important to note that the binder we used in this study , Ctx , is an inhibitor of EGFR function . Thus , candidates identified in our studies are specifically from the EGFR off - state neighborhood . We envision that MultiMap will be useful to study on - state , drug - bound , and resistance mutant neighborhoods , which will give a comprehensive map of the EGFR interactomes . MultiMap was also effective for long - range labeling of cell - cell synapses . As shown for the ones activated by BiTE or ( CAR ) T , we found that spatial variability among synaptic junctions can be addressed by using photo - probes with different labeling radii . The unique advantage of MultiMap allowing multi - scale labeling , potentiates its application for interactome profiling of additional intercellular interaction networks . In cases where antibodies are not available , one can use a genetically encoded tag on the target ECD , similar to the Flag and myc ecto - tags we introduced in our study . We can also envision proteome - wide interactome profiling for membrane proteins using these ecto - tags on par with the scale for the intracellular OpenCell system ( 64 ) . Lastly , we recognize that despite the confidence and accelerated process in target identification via MultiMap , information on candidate neighborhoods warrants further confirmation via more in - depth structural , mutational , and functional studies . Nonetheless , we believe that MultiMap proximity labeling proteomics integrated with in silico prediction can begin to provide plausible models for binary protein interactions with high structural precision . This would be crucial step forward to begin to construct a structural map of the protein - protein interactome on the cell surface . In addition , understanding how the surfaceome functions in concert with the external environment communication may suggest new neo - complexes to target for both small molecules and biologics .
