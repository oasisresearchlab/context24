Here we show that WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) interacts directly with N - WASP and actin . WIP retards N - WASP / Cdc42 - activated actin polymerization mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and stabilizes actin filaments . Microinjection of WIP into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts induces filopodia ; this is inhibited by microinjection of anti - N - WASP antibody . Microinjection of anti - WIP antibody inhibits induction of filopodia by bradykinin , by an active Cdc42 mutant ( Cdc42 ( V12 ) ) and by N - WASP . Our results indicate that WIP and N - WASP may act as a functional unit in filopodium formation , which is consistent with their role in actin - tail formation in cells infected with vaccinia virus or Shigella . S ignal - transduction pathways that link cell - surface receptors to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton involve the Rho family of small GTP - binding proteins ( G proteins ) , particularly Rho , Rac and Cdc42 . Cdc42 induces filopodia , Rac regulates lamellipodia formation , and Rho induces the formation of stress fibres 1 . Much recent work has focused on the mechanisms by which Rho proteins transduce receptor signals into spatial and temporal reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . The Cdc42 - interacting proteins WASP and its homologue N - WASP have a crucial function in linking Cdc42 to filopodium formation . WASP is expressed only in haematopoietic cells 2 , whereas N - WASP is ubiquitously expressed 3 . Both proteins possess a WASP - homology domain 1 ( WH1 ) , a Cdc42 / Rac GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) , a proline - rich domain , a G - actin - binding verprolin - homology domain , a cofilin - homology domain and a WB : anti - N - WASP WB : anti - N - WASP M r ( K ) M r ( K ) N - WASP N - WASP ( 1 – 400 ) N - WASP ( 1 – 220 ) N - WASP ( 1 – 140 ) N - WASP ( 140 – 505 ) WIP WIP ( 321 – 503 ) WIP ( 321 – 415 ) WIP ( 416 – 488 ) + + + + + + – + + + N - WASP interaction + + + + + + + + + + + / – L ys a t e W I P N - W ASP NR S 66 IP WIP 120 97 . 4 66 46 30 21 . 5 14 . 3 Amino acid 0 100 200 300 400 500 WIP Interaction WH1 IQ GBD Pro VH CH A ABM2 ABM2 VH Nck siteWASPsite ABM2 Controlantibody Anti - Xpress antibody a d e b c Figure 1 Interaction of WIP and N - WASP . a , Total lysates , WIP , N - WASP and nor - mal rabbit serum ( NRS ) immunoprecipitates ( IP ) from 50 · 10 6 cells were examined by western blotting ( WB ) for the presence of N - WASP . b , An aliquot of purified WIP was subjected to SDS – PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue .

Overexpression of N - WASP potentiates filopodium formation in fibroblasts microinjected with a mutant active form of Cdc42 . More importantly , microinjection of anti - N - WASP antibody inhibits Cdc42 - mediated formation of filopodia in bradykinin - stimulated fibroblasts 4 . Furthermore , megakaryocytes from patients with Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome are deficient in filopodium formation after adhesion to substrate 5 and macrophages derived from these patients do not form podosomes 6 . In addition to binding to G - actin through its verprolin - homolo - gy domain , N - WASP recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex through its C - ter - minal acidic domain 7 . The Arp2 / 3 complex , which is composed of seven polypeptides , has been shown to nucleate actin 8 and to bind to WASP family members 9 . Binding of Cdc42 to N - WASP causes a con - formational change in N - WASP , which allows the verprolin - homol - ogy – cofilin - homology – acidic ( VCA ) domain to interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex and initiate actin polymerization ; this is further enhanced by phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ; refs 10 , 11 ) . Overexpression of WASP in cells induces clusters of F - actin 12 , whereas inducible recruitment of WASP to a cell - surface receptor triggers both actin polymerization and filopodium formation 13 . This indicates that although interaction of WASP / N - WASP with Cdc42 may be sufficient to induce actin polymerization , other proteins may be required for spatial organization of actin into filopodia . We previously cloned a WASP - binding protein , WIP . WIP is a proline - rich protein of 503 amino acids that shows homology in its amino - terminal end to the yeast polarity - development protein ver - prolin 14 and contains both actin - and profilin - binding motifs . Overexpression of WIP in human B cell lines causes an increase in cellular F - actin content and induces formation of subcortical patch - es of actin 14 . Introduction of human WIP into verprolin - deficient yeast corrects their defects in cell growth , cytoskeletal organization , endocytosis and cell polarity 15 . Recently , it was reported that N - WASP and WIP are involved in formation of actin tails by vaccinia virus and Shigella 16 . However , the role of WIP in linking cell - surface receptor signalling to the actin cytoskeleton and the biochemistry of WIP – N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex – actin interactions have not been examined . Here we show that WIP regulates N - WASP - induced actin nucleation and is important for induction of actin - containing microspikes by bradykinin and Cdc42 . Results WIP interacts with N - WASP and actin . WIP immunoprecipitates of lysates from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts contained N - WASP ( Fig . 1a ) . The association of WIP and N - WASP was not limited to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts , as similar results were obtained using Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells ( data not shown ) . The interaction of WIP and N - WASP is direct , because purified recombinant WIP ( Fig . 1b ) precip - itated purified recombinant N - WASP ( Fig . 1c ) . We used a yeast two - hybrid system to map the interacting sites in N - WASP and WIP . The WIP - binding site on N - WASP maps to the N - terminal 140 amino acids , which include the WH1 domain ( amino acids 34 – 138 ) , but not the GBD domain ( amino acids 203 – 222 ; Fig . 1d ) . The interac - tion site for N - WASP maps to amino acids 416 – 488 of WIP ( Fig . 1e ) . The binding sites involved in the binding of WIP to N - WASP correspond to those involved in the binding of WIP to WASP 17 . As WIP and Cdc42 bind to two distinct regions of N - WASP , it was important to ascertain whether these proteins can exist in a trimolec - ular complex . WIP was pulled down by a glutathione - S - transferase - tagged Cdc42 mutant ( GST – Cdc42 ( L61 ) ) in the presence , but not in the absence , of N - WASP ( Fig . 2 , lanes 2 and 4 , respectively ) . This tri - molecular interaction is specific , because WIP was not pulled down by GST – RhoA ( L63 ) in the presence of N - WASP . The verprolin - homology domain of WIP contains the highly charged KLKK motif ( amino acids 45 – 48 ) . The same or similar motifs ( KLRK , KLRR ) have been implicated in the binding of thy - mosin - b 4 , Ena / VASP family members and verprolin to actin 18 – 20 .

Western blotting was carried out using anti - His , anti - N - WASP and anti - GST antibodies to detect WIP , N - WASP and GST - fusion proteins , respectively .

After SDS – PAGE , samples were western blotted ( WB ) with anti - actin mono - clonal antibody . GST – Cdc42 and GST alone were used as negative controls . b , Quantification of binding of G - actin to WIP . WIP ( 1 m g ) was coated overnight in 96 - well plates , and residual sites were blocked with BSA . Wells were rinsed twice with G - buffer ( see Methods ) and 0 – 178 pmol G - actin was added . Wells were washed to remove unbound G - actin , bound actin was solubilized by adding 30 m l of Laemmli buffer , and the content of each well was analysed by SDS – PAGE . Gels were stained with Coomassie blue , destained and dried on Whatman 3 paper and scanned .

The pellet was taken up in 30 m l of Laemmli buffer , and an aliquot of the pellet was analysed by SDS – PAGE . Gels were dried and bands were quantified ( see Methods ) . Similar results were obtained in two inde - pendent experiments . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MAY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 486 we could not express a full length GST – WIP protein , we exam - ined two complementary fusion proteins ( WIP ( 1 – 127 ) and WIP ( 128 – 503 ) ) for their capacity to bind to G - actin in a pull - down assay . WIP ( 1 – 127 ) , which contains the verprolin - homology region ( amino acids 1 – 117 ) , bound to G - actin ( Fig . 3a ) . In con - trast , WIP ( 128 – 503 ) , which lacks the verprolin - homology domain , did not ( Fig . 3a ) . This indicates that the verprolin - homology domain of WIP may be sufficient for actin binding . We evaluated the capacity of WIP to bind to actin filaments ( F - actin ) using a co - sedimentation assay . WIP by itself did not sedi - ment at 200 , 000 g . However , WIP co - sedimented with F - actin ( Fig . 3c ) . WIP ( 1 – 127 ) bound to F - actin , showing that the F - actin - bind - ing site also maps to the N - terminal region of WIP ( data not shown ) . The association of WIP with F - actin is specific , because the control protein BSA failed to sediment with F - actin ( data not shown ) . We used purified WIP to measure the affinity of binding to G - actin in a solid - phase binding assay 21 ( Fig . 3b ) , and of binding to F - actin in a co - sedimentation assay 22 ( Fig . 3d ) . The dissociation constant for G - actin was estimated as 640 nM and that for F - actin binding as 3 . 9 m M . WIP retards N - WASP / Cdc42 activated actin polymerization , but not in the presence of PIP 2 . As WIP binds directly to N - WASP , it may modulate N - WASP - induced actin nucleation mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Recombinant N - WASP ( 100 nM ) , in the absence of Cdc42 , caused little or no acceleration of actin assembly by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4a ) . WIP alone had no effect on actin poly - merization ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , WIP did not signifi - cantly affect Arp2 / 3 complex activity , regardless of the presence of N - WASP ( Fig . 4a ) . As reported previously 10 , Cdc42 – GTP ( 400 nM ) enhanced the ability of N - WASP to activate Arp2 / 3 complex - medi - ated actin polymerization ( Fig . 4b ) . WIP inhibited Cdc42 - induced activation of N - WASP in a dose - dependent manner ; at 400 nM it completely blocked N - WASP / Cdc42 - induced actin polymerization mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4b ) . There was a linear rela - tionship between WIP concentration and inhibition of actin poly - merization ( Fig . 4b , inset ) .

To exclude this possibility , we evaluated the effect of WIP on Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization activated by the C - terminal VCA segment of N - WASP ( amino acids 392 – 505 ) . This fragment maximally activates Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization independently of Cdc42 and PIP 2 ( ref . 10 ) , and does not bind to WIP ( Fig . 1d ) . WIP is therefore not expected to have an effect on the ability of the VCA segment to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , but could still interfere with actin polymerization by sequestering G - actin . At 400 nM , the concentration at which it completely inhibits Cdc42 - induced activation of N - WASP , WIP had no effect on activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by GST – VCA ( Fig . 4c ) . We conclude that binding of WIP to N - WASP is responsi - ble for its inhibition of N - WASP activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . PIP 2 binds to N - WASP and synergizes with Cdc42 in activating N - WASP , although by itself it has no effect on N - WASP activity 7 , 10 . WIP at concentrations of up to 2 m M failed to inhibit activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by N - WASP and Cdc42 in the presence of 1 m M PIP 2 ( Fig . 4d ) . To confirm that the reduction in the rate of N - WASP / Cdc42 - activated actin nucleation by WIP translates into a reduction in the rate of filament - end formation , we compared the barbed ends of actin filaments that were formed during the initial phase of actin assembly . We chose the 8 - min time point as this was beyond the initial lag phase and was in the linear phase for all con - centrations of WIP tested . We mixed 100 nM N - WASP with 400 nM Cdc42 , 33 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and increasing concentrations of WIP ( 0 , 100 , 200 or 400 nM ) , and assessed the amount of fila - ment ends formed using a seeded polymerization assay . The num - ber of barbed ends formed at 8 min was reduced in the presence of WIP : 13 · 10 11 in the absence of WIP compared with 10 . 7 · 10 11 at 100 nM WIP , 5 . 4 · 10 11 at 200 nM , and 3 . 3 · 10 11 at 400 nM . WIP stabilizes actin filaments . Expression of WIP increases the F - actin content of both BJAB cells 14 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts ( N . M - Q . and R . S . G . , unpublished observations ) . These increased levels of F - actin could be due to increased filament formation , stabilization of actin filaments or both . As we have shown that WIP binds to F - actin , we examined whether WIP affects the stability of actin fila - ments . F - actin diluted to low concentration ( < 1 m M ) in low - salt buffer spontaneously disassembled in an exponential manner ( Fig . 5 , curve 1 ) . Addition of WIP reduced the rate of disassembly in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 5 , curves 2 – 4 ) . This effect of WIP may be similar to that of several filament - binding proteins , such as tropomyosin 23 , a - actinin 24 and caldesmon 25 , that have been impli - cated in stabilizing actin filaments against depolymerization and severing . Microinjection of WIP induces filopodium formation . As WIP affects Cdc42 / N - WASP - induced actin polymerization and stabi - lizes actin filaments , we examined the effect of WIP microinjection . Microinjection of WIP , but not of BSA , into NIH 3T3 cells induced the formation of filopodia within 20 min and caused a striking increase in F - actin staining ( Fig . 6a ) . A quarter of all WIP - injected cells , compared with only 1 % of BSA - injected cells , had filopodia ( P < 0 . 01 ) . Time - lapse video microscopy demonstrated that the filopodia induced by WIP represent cell protrusions ( that is , true filopodia ) , rather than having been formed by retractions , and were highly motile ( Fig . 6b ) . To investigate the role of WIP in physiological filopodium for - mation , we localized WIP in fibroblasts stimulated with bradykinin . In unstimulated , serum - starved NIH 3T3 cells , WIP was predominantly localized in the perinuclear area and did not colocalize with F - actin ( Fig . 6c , left panels ) . However , after stimu - lation with bradykinin for 15 min , WIP became detectable in filopodia and colocalized with F - actin throughout the cell . Although staining with TRITC – phalloidin ( see Methods ) was intense , colocalization of WIP and F - actin was not due to bleed - through of TRITC through the FITC filter . Only weak background green fluorescence was detected when normal rabbit immunoglob - ulin G ( IgG ) was substituted for anti - WIP IgG ( data not shown ) . WIP and N - WASP act as a unit in filopodium formation . N - WASP has been shown to be important for induction of filopodia by bradykinin 4 . Furthermore , we found that microinjection of N - WASP in NIH 3T3 cells induces filopodium formation . Because similar results were obtained in cells injected with N - WASP and those injected with N - WASP plus control IgG , only the latter data are shown ( Fig . 7a ) . To identify the way in which WIP and N - WASP are juxtaposed in the pathway that leads to filopodium formation , we examined both the effect of anti - WIP antibody on induction of filopodia by N - WASP and the effect of anti - N - WASP antibody on filopodium induction by WIP .

Co - microinjection of anti - N - WASP IgG signifi - cantly inhibited filopodium formation in cells microinjected with WIP ( Fig . 7b ) ; these latter cells also developed prominent actin clusters . These results indicate that induction of filopodia by WIP may depend on N - WASP , and that N - WASP and WIP may function as a unit in filopodium formation . WIP functions in formation of filopodia by bradykinin and Cdc42 . We assessed the role of WIP in the bradykinin signalling pathway by examining the effect of microinjection of anti - WIP antibody on induction of filopodia by bradykinin . Injection of con - trol IgG or affinity - purified anti - WIP IgG into serum - starved , unstimulated NIH 3T3 cells caused no noticeable change in the cytoskeleton . Anti - WIP IgG , but not control IgG , significantly inhibited formation of filopodia in response to bradykinin stimu - lation ( Fig . 8a ) . Cdc42 induces filopodium formation , and has been reported to be important for induction of filopodia by bradykinin 26 . Microinjection of anti - WIP IgG significantly inhibited filopodium formation in cells microinjected with a constitutively active Cdc42 ( V12 ) mutant ( Fig . 8b ) . This inhibition was specific , as anti - WIP IgG inhibited neither induction of lamellipodia by constitutive - ly active Rac ( L61 ) nor formation of stress fibres by constitutively active RhoA ( L63 ) . These results indicate that WIP may function in formation of filopodia induced by bradykinin and Cdc42 . Discussion We have shown that WIP binds to N - WASP and actin , regulates N - WASP - mediated actin nucleation mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and has an important role in induction of filopodia by bradykinin and Cdc42 . Our results also indicate that WIP and N - WASP may form a functional unit in induction of filopodia . In a recent study , the interaction between WIP and N - WASP was described on the basis of pull - down assays using lysates from cells overexpressing these proteins 16 . It remained unclear whether the interaction of WIP and N - WASP is direct and whether it occurs under physiological conditions . We have clearly shown that WIP and N - WASP interact directly , as recombinant N - WASP binds to recombinant WIP . Furthermore , the two proteins readily co - pre - cipitate from lysates of unstimulated cells , indicating that their interaction may be constitutive . The binding site on WIP for N - WASP is similar to that for WASP , and maps to a stretch of 73 amino acids in the C - terminal region of the molecule . The WIP - binding region on N - WASP is localized to the N - terminal end and encompasses the WH1 domain , but is distinct from the Cdc42 - binding domain , as in the case for WASP 14 . WIP binds directly to both G - and F - actin . The actin - binding region of WIP is localized to the verprolin - homology domain , which is consistent with the previous finding that the verprolin - homology domain of verprolin interacts directly with actin 19 . Thus , WIP has two distinct functional domains , an N - terminal , actin - binding verprolin - homology region and a C - terminal WASP / N - WASP - binding region , which are separated by a proline - rich central core . In vitro biochemical studies using recombinant WIP and N - WASP revealed that WIP retards Cdc42 / N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . This effect was not due to sequestration of actin monomers by WIP , because WIP had no effect on actin polymerization caused by the VCA domain of N - WASP , which does not bind to WIP . The N - WASP - binding sites for Cdc42 and WIP are distinct . Furthermore , WIP , Cdc42 and N - WASP can form a trimolecular complex . It is therefore unlikely that WIP competitively inhibits the ability of Cdc42 to bind to N - WASP . Nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown that the C - terminal VCA domain of WASP interacts with the GTPase - binding domain 27 . Binding of Cdc42 to WASP disrupts this interaction , freeing the VCA domain to interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex . N - WASP also exists in a closed conformation that is formed by intramolecular interactions similar to those that occur in N - WASP + control IgG N - WASP + anti - WIP IgG WIP + control IgG a b WIP + anti - N - WASP IgG 30 – 1 % 5 – 1 % * 5 – 1 % * 20 – 2 % 7 – 1 % * Figure 7 WIP and N - WASP act as a unit in filopodium formation .

We propose that binding of WIP to the WH1 domain , which immediately precedes the GTPase - binding region , may sta - bilize the closed , inactive conformation of WASP / N - WASP . This may explain the in vitro effect of WIP in slowing the rate of actin polymerization by Cdc42 - activated N - WASP . In vivo , other mole - cules , such as PIP 2 , may interact with the WIP – N - WASP complex , and may displace or counteract the inhibitory effect of WIP . Despite the retarding effect of WIP on Cdc42 / N - WASP - mediat - ed actin polymerization , overexpression of WIP caused an increase in the F - actin content of cells and induced the formation of filopo - dia . WIP may increase cellular F - actin content by virtue of its ability to stabilize F - actin . Indeed , WIP colocalizes with filopodia and stress fibres in bradykinin - stimulated cells . In unstimulated cells , WIP is present in a perinuclear location . Injection of WIP into the cytosol may activate actin polymerization through pathways that may include binding partners such as type I myosins and profil - in 29 , 30 . In fact , it was recently reported that the yeast homologue of WIP , verprolin , binds to Myo3p and Myo5p 29 and is critical for induction of actin polymerization by these proteins 31 . N - WASP has an important role in formation of filopodia by bradykinin and Cdc42 , and we also found that microinjection of N - WASP induces filopodia in NIH 3T3 cells .

This discrepancy may relate to differences in cell type and / or experimental conditions . Similar degrees of filopodium formation were induced using two different preparations of N - WASP . One of the preparations was partially active in induction of Arp2 / 3 com - plex - mediated actin polymerization in vitro , whereas the second preparation had no discernible activity . However , we cannot rule out the presence in the latter preparation of a small fraction of ‘acti - vated’ N - WASP that may have been insufficient to cause detectable actin polymerization in vitro , but was sufficient for filopodium for - mation in cells . Alternatively , N - WASP may be activated after microinjection into cells . Microinjection of anti - WIP antibody inhibited induction of filopodia by bradykinin and Cdc42 . This clearly places WIP in the bradykinin – Cdc42 – N - WASP pathway of filopodium formation . Furthermore , our results indicate that WIP and N - WASP may function as unit in formation of filopodia after Cdc42 activation , as microinjection of each of these two proteins was inhibited by co - microinjection of an antibody against the other . Consistent with our results is the recent proposal that WIP and N - WASP act as a unit in formation of actin tails by vaccinia virus and Shigella 16 . WIP and N - WASP may act in concert as a complex to recruit molecules that synergize in forming filopodia . We hypothesize that N - WASP is important for the appropriate localization of WIP in areas of active filopodial growth at the cell membrane , whereas WIP is important for stabilization of actin filaments in filopodia , possibly by reducing the frequency of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching and / or by bundling actin filaments . Further work is needed to elu - cidate the exact function of WIP , N - WASP and their partners in formation of filopodia . Methods Antibodies . Anti - WIP antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with a 14 - amino - acid C - terminal peptide of human WIP ( 483ESRSGSNRRERGAP496 ) . This antibody did not crossreact with purified recombi - nant N - WASP . Affinity - purified anti N - WASP antibody was prepared as described 4 , and did not react with purified recombinant WIP ( data not shown ) . Purification of WIP . WIP complementary DNA ( cDNA ) was cloned into the baculoviral expression vector pBlueBac ( Invitrogen ) in phase with Xpress and His epitopes and the expressed recombinant WIP was purified from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus . Briefly , Sf9 cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer ( 50mM sodium phosphate , 500mM NaCl , protease inhibitors and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and sonicated to lyse the cells . Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16 , 000 g , filtered through a 0 . 45 m M filter and bulk - adsorbed onto nickel – agarose ( Qiagen ) . After binding at 4 (cid:176) C for 2h , the gel was washed successively with buffers 1 – 4 . ( Buffers 1 – 4 all have 50mM sodium phosphate pH8 . 0 , and 500mM NaCl ; buffer 1 also contains 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ; buffer 2 also contains 1M urea ; buffer 3 also contains 20 % glycerol ) . Bound WIP was eluted with elution buffer ( 50mM sodium phosphate , 500mM NaCl and 300mM imidazole ) . Fractions containing WIP were pooled and applied to a Sephadex G - 50 col - umn equilibrated with XB buffer ( 20mM HEPES pH7 . 4 , 100mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM dithio - threitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 5mM ATP and 0 . 1mM EDTA ) , and WIPfractions were pooled and concentrated using Centricon concentrators and stored at – 70 (cid:176) C . Purified WIP migrated as a single band on poly - acrylamide gels ( Fig . 1b ) . Immunoprecipitation , pull - down assays and western blotting . NIH 3T3 cells ( 50 · 10 6 cells per ml ) were lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 10mM Tris pH7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 50 % glycerol , 1mM sodium orthovanadate , 50mM NaF and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride ) containing protease - inhibitor cocktail ( Complete , Roche ) . Lysates were incubated at 4 (cid:176) C overnight with 1 m g of anti - WIP antibody ( pre - adsorbed onto 40 m l of protein G – sepharose ) per ml of lysate . Precipitates were washed four times with wash buffer , eluted in Laemmli loading buffer , subjected to SDS – PAGE on 4 – 15 % gradient gels ( Bio - Rad ) , western blotted with anti - N - WASP rabbit antiserum and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL , Amersham ) . Interaction between purified , recombinant WIP and N - WASP was analysed as follows : 1 m g puri - fied WIP was incubated with recombinant 0 . 1 m g N - WASP in XB buffer containing 0 . 01 % Tween 20 and 0 . 01 % BSA on ice for 60min . WIP was immunoprecipitated with anti - Xpress antibody ( Invitrogen ) , immobilized on protein G – sepharose , washed , run on SDS – PAGE gels and western blot - ted . Western blots were developed using anti - N - WASP antiserum . The trimolecular interaction between WIP , N - WASP and Cdc42 was examined in a pull - down assay as follows : 20 m l of glutathione – sepharose beads ( Amersham ) were incubated with 4 m g of the domi - nant mutants GST – Cdc42 ( L61 ) or GST – RhoA ( L63 ) ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , Colorado ) in 10 m l of XB buffer for 1h at 4 (cid:176) C . Beads were washed twice with 100 m l of XB buffer and then incubated with the appropriate combination of recombinant WIP ( 1 . 5 m g ) and / or N - WASP ( 1 . 5 m g ) in a final volume of 100 m l of XB buffer containing 0 . 01 % Tween 20 , 0 . 01 % BSA and 20mM imidazole . After gentle rock - ing for 4h at 4 (cid:176) C , beads were washed three times with 400 m l of PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 . Samples were subjected to SDS – PAGE and were then western blotted using anti - His antibody ( Qiagen ; to detect WIP ) , anti - N - WASP antiserum or anti - GST antibody ( Amersham ) . Expression and purification of recombinant protein . To obtain the GST – WIP ( 1 – 127 ) and GST – WIP ( 128 – 503 ) constructs , cDNAs encoding amino acids 1 – 127 and 128 – 503 of WIP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using appropriate oligonucleotides and cloned in - frame with GST in the vector pGEX 4T - 1 ( Amersham ) . All expression constructs were verified by DNA - sequence analysis , and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) for expression of the fusion proteins . Expression of fusion proteins was induced using isopropyl - b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . GST – Cdc42 ( V12 ) was a gift from J . Settleman ( Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston ) . GST – RhoA ( L63 ) and GST – Rac ( L61 ) were from Cytoskeleton Inc . Recombinant purified N - WASP was a gift from M . Kirschner ( Harvard Medical School , Boston ) . G - actin was puri - fied as described 32 . Interaction of WIP and N - WASP in the yeast two - hybrid system . Full - length N - WASP cDNA was obtained by semi - nested PCR from human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA ( Clontech ) using two sense primers ( nucleotides 209 – 232 and 255 – 279 ) and one antisense primer ( nucleotides 1754 – 1772 ) according to the N - WASP human cDNA sequence ( GenBank acces - sion no . D88460 ) . The sequence was verified and cloned into the bait vector pGBT9 ( Clontech ) . N - WASP truncation mutants were generated by cleavage using appropriate restriction enzymes . Full - length and truncation - mutant WIP were previously cloned in the activation - domain vector 14 , 17 . Double transformants were selected on Leu – Trp – media .

Actin used in all experiments was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle essentially as described 33 , with modifications as described 34 . The GST pull - down assay was carried out as described 10 . Equal amounts of GST - fusion protein of each mutant ( ~ 5 m g per 10 m l packed beads ) were incubated with 100 m l G - actin in binding buffer ( 10mM HEPES pH7 . 0 , 100mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM DTT , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , 0 . 2mM ATP and 0 . 5mgml – 1 ovalbumin ) for 2h at 4 (cid:176) C with gentle rocking . G - actin was used at a concentration of 0 . 05 m M , below the critical concentration for barbed filament ends . Beads were washed twice with binding buffer without ovalbumin and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer . Samples were analysed by SDS – PAGE and western blotting using an anti - actin monoclonal antibody ( Chemicon , Temecula , California ) . In the co - sedimentation assay , 5 m M F - actin and 0 . 25 m M WIP were incubated in F - actin buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH7 . 4 , 100mM KCl , 0 . 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1mM EGTA and 0 . 5mM ATP ) for 30min on ice . Samples were centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 30min . Pellets were washed twice with F - actin buffer and resuspended in 50 m l of Laemmli buffer . Fifteen microlitres were loaded onto a gel , electrophoresed , transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and western blotted with rabbit anti - WIP antiserum . Under the experimental conditions , WIP at concentrations of up to 2 m M did not self - pellet . Assay of solid - phase binding of G - actin to WIP . Binding of G - actin to WIP was quanitified essentially as described 21 . Briefly , 1 m g WIP was coated overnight in 96 - well Nunc Maxisorp plates in sodium bicarbonate buffer ( pH7 . 6 ) . Wells were rinsed twice with G - buffer ( 0 . 2mM HEPES , 2mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2mM DTT ) and residual sites were blocked for 2h with BSA in G - buffer . Wells were rinsed twice with G - buffer and G - actin was added at 0 . 2 – 3 . 6 m M . After incubation at room temperature for 1h , wells were washed three times with G - buffer and bound actin was solubilized by adding 30 m l of Laemmli buffer and incubating at 65 (cid:176) C for 20min . The content of each well was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes , boiled and run on 4 – 15 % SDS – PAGE gels , then stained with Coomassie blue . After destaining , gels were dried on Whatman 3 paper and scanned , and the amount of actin recovered was quantified using NIH Image 1 . 62 software . The binding constant was obtained from the data by Scatchard analysis . Binding to actin filaments . Binding of WIP to actin filaments was quantified essentially as described 22 . WIP in X - buffer was clari - fied by centrifugation at 200 , 000 g for 30min . WIP ( 220nM ) was mixed with F - actin ( 0 – 30 m M ) in a total volume of 120 m l in the presence of 7 m M phallicidin ( Sigma ) , incubated at room temperature for 30min and centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 30min .

Briefly , actin was mixed with pyrene - labelled actin at a ratio of 3 : 2 and was used at a final concentration of 1 m M in a total volume of 80 m l of XB buffer . Proteins were exchanged into XB buffer before the assay . Proteins were mixed and pre - incubated for 5min at room temperature and the reaction was initiated by addition of actin ; the increase in fluorescence was monitored using a spectrofluorimeter . Curves were shifted along the abscissa to account for the delay between addition of actin and the first fluorescent reading . Measurement of filament ends . N - WASP ( 100nM ) was mixed with 400nM Cdc42 , 33nM Arp2 / 3 complex and varying amounts of WIP . Actin polymerization was initiated by adding 1 m M unlabelled actin . Eight minutes into the poly - merization reaction , aliquots were withdrawn and used as seed for filament growth by diluting them 15 - fold in XB buffer containing 1 m M pyrene - labelled actin . Assembly of filaments over time was monitored © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MAY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 491 using a spectrofluorimeter . The number of barbed filament ends was calculated as described 35 , 36 . Actin - depolymerization assay . F - actin at low concentration ( < 1 m M ) and in low - salt buffer spontaneously depolymerizes in an expo - nential manner . G - actin mixed with tracer pyrene - labelled actin at a ratio of 19 : 1 was polymerized at 40 m M . F - actin was diluted to 0 . 67 m M in 300 m l buffer A ( 5mM Tris pH8 . 0 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2mM ATP and 0 . 5mM DTT ) and the reduction in fluorescence , which is an index of the rate of depolymer - ization , was monitored using a spectrofluorimeter . WIP was desalted into buffer A and centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 30min immediately before the experiments and was added at the indicated amounts . Microinjection . Subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells were serum - starved for 16h , trypsinized and resuspended in serum - free Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium ( GibcoBRL ) containing 0 . 5mgml – 1 soybean trypsin inhibitor ( Sigma – Aldrich ) . Cells were plated onto coverslips coated with fibronectin ( Intergen , Purchase , New York ) and allowed to attach for at least 3h . Microinjection was carried out using an Eppendorf auto - matic microinjector ( Transjector 5246 and InjectMan Micromanipulator 5179 ) set at 50 – 60hPa for 0 . 3 s . After microinjection , cells were incubated for 20min before fixation or stimulation . Dextran cascade blue ( Molecular Probes ) was used as a tracer for microinjected cells . Protein concentrations of microinjected samples were as follows : affinity - purified anti - WIP IgG rabbit antibody , 500 m gml – 1 ; anti - N - WASP IgG rabbit antibody , 1mgml – 1 ; purified rabbit IgG , 500 m gml – 1 ; WIP , 275 m gml – 1 ; N - WASP , Cdc42 ( V12 ) , BSA , RhoA ( L63 ) and Rac ( L61 ) , 200 m gml – 1 . At least 100 cells were microinjected in each experiment . A cell was scored as positive for filopodium formation if it had ‡ 20 actin - contain - ing projections . Enumeration of cells with filopodia was carried out ‘blind’ . For video microscopy , NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated onto fibronectin - coated coverslips , attached for 16h and then serum - starved for 2 days in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 0 . 5 % FCS . Frames were taken at 5 - min intervals , starting at 0min , using NIH Image 1 . 62 software , at · 400 magnification on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope with a CCD - 300 - RC charge - coupled device cam - era ( Dage - MTI , Michigan City , Illinois ) . Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop . Immunofluorescence . Cellswere fixed with 4 % formalin solution ( Sigma ) in PBS at room temperature for 20min , washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS at room temperature for 5min . Cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 2 % BSA ( GibcoBRL ) in PBS for 10min and then stained for WIP , actin or both . For WIP staining , cells were incubated with anti - WIP antibody for 1h , washed three times with PBS then incubated with anti - rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conju - gated antibody for a further hour . Staining with anti - WIP antibody was specific , as it was blocked by premixing the antibody with the immunizing peptide but not with an irrelevant peptide ( KNTDGSIS - LIIFPS ) . For actin staining , cells were incubated with 1 m M tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate - con - jugated phalloidin ( TRITC – phalloidin ; Sigma ) for 20min at room temperature . Double - labelling experiments were carried out sequentially , incubating with TRITC – phalloidin after washing off the secondary antibody .
