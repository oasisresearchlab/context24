Introduction During the last decade , scholars have developed a resource - based framework for analyzing firm behavior and competitive strategy . Its focus on the internal characteristics of firms distinguishes this analytic approach from (cid:14) . that of the ‘competitive forces’ schema of Porter 1980 . Development of the resource - based view of the firm has paralleled an upsurge in domestic and international interfirm collaboration that has spawned a large empirical literature . Although a few studies have brought together strands of the resource - based view with (cid:14) . analyses of interfirm collaboration Teece , 1989 , most of these theoretical efforts have eschewed empirical analysis . In this paper , we seek to link the resource - based view of the firm with an analysis of partner choice in interfirm collaboration that emphasizes the role of partners’ technological capabilities . These collaborative ventures include joint ventures and other interfirm agreements that involve the pooling of capital , employees , technology , or other expertise and assets of participating firms to an undertaking that combines elements of ) Corresponding author .

Our analysis provides new measures of technical resources and new tests of the determinants of partner choice in interfirm alliances . This aspect of interfirm collaboration has received little attention thus far in the large literature on strategic alliances , and our work complements recent (cid:14) . empirical work of Gulati 1995a , b on the topic . This paper’s analysis also gives greater concreteness to the resource - based view , which has suffered from a tendency toward ad hoc , ex post , and informal discussion . Immediately below , we briefly survey the voluminous literature on the resource - based view of the firm and factors influencing partner choice in interfirm collaboration . This is followed by an outline of our empirical framework and statistical analysis of the hypothesized links between firm - specific technological resources and partner selection in strategic alliances . A brief summary and concluding remarks follow . 2 . The resource - based view of the firm (cid:14) . (cid:14) . The resource - based view of the firm has its roots in the work of Penrose 1959 , Chandler 1977 , Nelson (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . and Winter 1982 , and has been developed in work by Wernerfelt 1984 , Barney 1986 , Teece 1988 , 1989 (cid:14) . and Teece et al . 1994a , among others , largely as a reaction against the ‘competitive forces’ analysis of firm (cid:14) . strategy Porter , 1980 . In the competitive forces framework , a firm’s performance is essentially determined by the structure of the industry within which it operates—the ‘five forces’ of entry barriers , substitutes , buyers’ and suppliers’ bargaining power , and intra - industry rivalry . The primary determinants of success thus are external to the firm , resting on characteristics of industry structure , rather than on the firm’s internal managerial , technical , marketing , and other resources . As a consequence , the competitive forces approach to the theory of the firm says little about the limits , if any , on a particular firm’s ability to enter new markets or lines of business . 1 In contrast , the resource - based theory of the firm argues that a business enterprise is best viewed as a collection of sticky and difficult - to - imitate resources and capabilities . Such resources may be physical , such as product designs and production techniques , or intangible , such as brand equity . They also include knowledge of specific markets or user needs , idiosyncratic ‘routines’ , such as decision - making techniques or management systems , and complex networks for handling the marketing and distribution of products . Despite their importance within the resource - based framework , the processes underpinning the creation and (cid:14) dissipation of these resources emphasized , for example , in Dierickx and Cool , 1989 ; Pavitt et al . , 1989 ; Teece . et al . , 1994b have not been intensively analyzed . Nevertheless , this literature contains extensive discussions of the key characteristics of capabilities , particularly technology - related ones . Such capabilities often are based on tacit knowledge and are subject to considerable uncertainty concerning their quality and performance . Market transactions for the sale or acquisition of such resources therefore are difficult to organize and are subject to (cid:14) . high risks of failure Teece , 1982 ; Pisano , 1990 . Thus , the same characteristics that enable a firm to extract a sustainable rent stream from its resources often make it difficult for the firm to transfer them to new uses , apply (cid:14) . 2 them in unrelated lines of business , or sell them in market transactions Mowery , 1983 . Such failures in the ‘market for capabilities’ also make it difficult for firms to acquire technological capabilities from external sources through market channels . Alliances and other interfirm collaborative 1 (cid:14) . Nelson 1994 argues that in neoclassical economics , ‘‘Firms facing different markets will behave and perform differently , but if the market conditions were reversed , firm behaviors would be too . Where the theory admits product differentiation , different firms will produce different products , but in the theoretical literature any firm can choose any niche . Thus there are firm differences , but there is no essential (cid:14) . autonomous quality to them . ’’ p . 253 . 2 w x w ‘‘ At least in the short run , firms are to some degree stuck with what they have and may have to live with what they lack for three x reasons . First , business development is viewed as an extremely complex process . Quite simply , firms lack the organizational capacity to develop new competencies quickly . . . Secondly , some assets are simply not readily tradable , for example , tacit know - how . . . and reputation . . . Thus , resource endowments cannot equilibrate through factor input prices . Finally , even when an asset can be purchased , firms (cid:14) . may stand to gain little by doing so . ’’ Teece et al . , 1994a , p . 10 . ( ) D . C .

Capabilities and partner choice in interfirm alliances 3 . 1 . The growth of alliances The last fifteen years have witnessed dramatic growth in the founding of international joint ventures and strategic alliances , many of which are concerned with the manufacture of goods for global markets and joint (cid:14) . 3 development of new products Hagedoorn and Schakenraad , 1990 ; Mowery and Oxley , 1995 .

Countries LDCs in 1980 – 1984 and 1985 – 1989 . Interfirm alliances established during the 1980s and 1990s tend to concentrate in high - technology industries : (cid:14) . Of 839 agreements studied by Hergert and Morris 1988 , approximately 24 % were in automobiles , 19 % in aerospace , 17 % in telecommunications , 14 % in computers and 13 % in other electrical industries . A more (cid:14) complete sample of global alliances compiled by researchers in the Netherlands Hagedoorn and Schakenraad , . 1990 , 1992 also reveals a concentration of alliances in high - technology sectors , although there are some (cid:14) . differences in the specific industries represented . Most noticeably , biotechnology 15 % and new materials (cid:14) . 4 10 % figure more prominently in this sample . 3 Interfirm alliances assume many forms , running the gamut from the classic equity joint venture , incorporated as a separate entity with equity shared among the partners , to informal or contract - based partnerships , or the purchase by one firm of an equity share in another . In some circumstances , joint ventures and other alliances are extensions of subcontracting relationships that cover product development and manufacture ; others focus on marketing of products manufactured largely by one partner . Our empirical study focuses primarily on equity (cid:14) joint ventures , but we also include other types of interfirm alliances in some of the empirical samples see discussion in Section 6 below and 17 . . 4 (cid:14) . (cid:14) . Other industrial sectors with significant representation in this data set are information technology 40 % , automobiles 8 % and (cid:14) . electrical equipment 5 % . ( ) D . C .

Source : Freeman and Hagedoorn 1995 , p . 43 . Change in the number , nature , and sectoral composition of alliances over the past two decades has been attributed to the increased pace of technological development and the need to share research and development costs , as ‘technological convergence’ expands the scope of technical expertise necessary for technological (cid:14) . innovation Harrigan , 1986 ; Mowery , 1989 ; Hagedoorn , 1993 .

Alliances and partner choice The literature on strategic alliances has grown almost as rapidly as the alliances plotted in Fig . 1 . But the empirical component of this literature focuses primarily on the decision to pursue a joint venture or strategic alliance , relative to other mechanisms for international expansion or market entry . The factors determining (cid:14) . firms’ choice of alliance partners have received little attention , as Gulati 1995b points out . Indeed , the studies (cid:14) . of Gulati 1995a , b are among the only empirical examinations of this topic , analyzing the influence of ‘strategic interdependence’ and ‘trust’ on firms’ choice of strategic alliance partners . As his most recent paper notes , the influence of firm - specific capabilities on partner choice has not been the focus of much empirical (cid:14) . research Gulati , 1995b , p . 640 . Motives for establishing interfirm alliances differ among firms , and these different motives may affect both (cid:14) . the choice of partner s and the effects of partner choice on the capabilities of participating firms . For example , firms jointly pursuing collaborative development of a technology or product within an alliance are likely to require some level of technological ‘overlap’ , to facilitate knowhow exchange and development . We therefore expect that alliance partners will display some similarity in technological capabilities at the time the alliance is established . 5 Similarly , when an alliance is used by one firm to internalize new technology - based capabilities from a partner , the demands of the technology absorption process are such that the ‘student’ must have considerable in - house technical expertise that complements the technology development activities of the alliance (cid:14) . Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 . Alliances that focus on joint R & D or product development thus should involve 5 (cid:14) . Cantwell and Barrera 1996 argue in their analysis of technology - based collaboration in the interwar electrical equipment and chemicals industry cartels that ‘‘Firms with dissimilar profiles of technological effort will be likely to have less incentive to exchange (cid:14) . knowledge . . . ’’ p . 2 . ( ) D . C . Mowery et al . r Research Policy 27 1998 507 – 523 511 firms with ex ante technology - based capabilities that are similar in scale and scope . 6 In addition , technological ‘overlap’ among alliance partners may increase over the course of collaboration , as a result of organizational learning and technology transfer within the venture . 7 What about alliances motivated by other factors , such as access to markets ? In many market - access alliances , one firm provides technological , manufacturing , or other capabilities in exchange for another’s marketing capabilities . Co - development and joint R & D are less frequent in these types of alliances and , since internaliza - tion of technological capabilities rarely is an explicit goal of partners in these alliances , the extent of ex ante technological overlap required by the partners in market - access alliances should be lower than for technology - based alliances . 4 . Hypotheses The foregoing discussion can be summarized in a set of testable hypotheses . First , the resource - based view argues that a key motive for the formation of alliances is the desire of participants to acquire capabilities from an external source . To successfully absorb external technological information , a firm must have relevant in - house technological skills . Therefore we expect a firm to choose alliance partners with overlapping portfolios of technological resources : H1 : Joint venture partners will display a higher degree of technological overlap compared with a similar sample of ‘non - collaborators’ . Although some degree of technological overlap is necessary to support a successful alliance , at some point such overlap yields diminishing and perhaps even negative returns . A very high degree of overlap between two firms may indicate that neither firm has much to learn from the other , thus inhibiting their participation in an (cid:14) . alliance . The benefits to a firm from an alliance with a partner that has identical i . e . , completely overlapping technological capabilities are likely to be lower than those achieved through internal capabilities development . Thus , we expect technological overlap to be a positive factor in partner choice for low to moderate levels of overlap , but this effect should be negative at higher levels of overlap . H2 : There is an inverted - U relationship between the degree of technological overlap between two firms and the likelihood of their forming an alliance . Over time , as a consequence of organizational learning , firms absorb some of the capabilities of their alliance partner . Participation in an alliance therefore should increase the similarity of partners’ technological profiles , leading to our third hypothesis : H3 : Technological overlap of joint venture partners post - collaboration will be greater than that prior to collaboration , irrespective of motives underlying formation of the alliance . 6 A complementary technology - based motive for the formation of strategic alliances that would yield similar predictions is the (cid:14) . internalization of technological ‘spillovers’ among firms , i . e . , technological externalities See Jaffe , 1989 ; Griliches , 1991 . As this observation suggests , a number of motives for alliance formation are likely to favor the choice of partners with similar technological portfolios . 7 (cid:14) . Cantwell and Barrera 1996 test a similar proposition , although their tests are weakened by the small number of observations in their dataset . ( ) D . C . Mowery et al . r Research Policy 27 1998 507 – 523 512 Although some technological learning may occur in alliances motivated by market access , we expect such learning to be less extensive than in technology - based alliances . Thus , alliances that focus on technological collaboration , particularly those involving joint R & D or product development , are more likely to exhibit the effects hypothesized earlier than those formed to pursue other objectives : H4 : Partners in technology - based alliances will exhibit greater technological overlap than partners in market - access alliances ; (cid:14) . H5 : Partners in alliances at early stages of the innovation process i . e . , research alliances will exhibit greater technological overlap than partners in production or marketing alliances . 5 . Measures of technological overlap Recent theoretical work on the resource - based view of the firm contains considerable discussion about narrowly defined firm - specific resources or capabilities , but empirical work has relied on aggregate measures that are subject to many different interpretations . For example , R & D intensity has frequently been used as a (cid:14) . proxy for technological resources for example , in Montgomery and Hariharan , 1991 ; or Nakamura et al . , 1996 , despite the fact that it is an input into the creation of corporate capabilities , rather than an output . Some recent empirical work in this tradition has measured firms’ technological resources through the use of patent data to (cid:14) . circumvent some of the limitations of R & D data e . g . , Silverman , 1996 . This study extends the use of patent statistics as measures of firm - specific technological capabilities . 8 When the U . S . Patent and Trademark Office grants a patent , the patent examiner includes a list of all previous patents on which the granted patent is based . The examiner is aided in this task by the patent applicant , who is legally bound to provide with the application a list of all patents that constitute relevant ‘prior art’ . 9 Citations of prior patents thus serve as an indicator of the technological lineage of new patents , much as bibliographic citations indicate the intellectual lineage of academic research . Recent work on the geographic (cid:14) . (cid:14) ‘localization’ of knowledge - based spillovers Jaffe et al . , 1993 uses citations specifically , the geographic . proximity of cited and citing patents to measure R & D spillovers . In this study , we use citations to measure the degree to which two firms’ technological capabilities overlap—that is , the extent to which their technological resources draw from the same pools of technological knowledge . Technological overlap between two firms is measured here by their ‘patent cross - citation rate’ or ‘common citation rate’ , each of which measures different aspects of technological overlap . The ‘cross - citation rate’ for Firm and Firm is defined as follows : i j Cross - Citation Rate Firm , Firm s Citation Rate Firm , Firm q Citation Rate Firm , Firm , (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . i j i j j i where Citations to Firm patents in Firm ’s patents j i Citation Rate Firm , Firm s (cid:14) . i j Total citations in Firm ’s patents i The patent cross - citation rate provides a measure of the relative importance of patents held by Firm in j (cid:14) . Firm ’s technology portfolio and vice versa , and firms with a higher cross - citation rate exhibit a higher degree i 8 (cid:14) . (cid:14) . See Griliches 1990 or Silverman 1996 for extensive discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of patent data . 9 In addition to the legal requirement , it is in the applicant’s interest to be forthcoming in this list because a more complete description of prior art is likely to reduce the prospects of an interference being declared during the processing of a patent application . ( ) D . C . Mowery et al . r Research Policy 27 1998 507 – 523 513 of technological overlap . An alternative measure , the ‘common patent citation rate’ for Firm and Firm , is i j defined as follows : Citations in Firm ’s patents to patents cited in Firm ’s patents i j Common Citation Rate Firm , Firm s (cid:14) . i j Total citations in Firm ’s patents i Citations in Firm ’s patents to patents cited in Firm ’s patents j i q Total citations in Firm ’s patents i The common citation rate measures the degree to which Firm and Firm draw from the same external j i technology ‘pool’ , and firms with a higher common citation rate therefore exhibit a higher degree of technological overlap . Both common citation rates and cross - citation rates are used in the following empirical analysis . 10 6 . Empirical analysis 6 . 1 . Sample Our hypotheses were tested by examining patent cross - citation and common citation rates among partners in bilateral equity joint ventures that involved at least one US firm and were established during 1985 – 1986 . The (cid:14) . sample of joint ventures was taken from the Cooperative Agreements and Technology Indicators CATI database , a comprehensive dataset that contains information on over 9000 alliances involving 5000 firms in (cid:14) . 11 many industries and countries Hagedoorn and Schakenraad , 1990 . The years 1985 – 1986 were chosen as the sample period because these were years in which new joint venture formation was at its height , and together the two years yield a sample size sufficient for the statistical tests of our hypotheses . Restricting the sample period minimizes the impact of trends in patenting and citation activity that affect all firms . In addition , selecting a period in the mid - 1980s allows straightforward computation of (cid:14) ‘before’ and ‘after’ patent citation rates from data that cover patents granted between 1975 and 1992 see . below . The resulting sample has 151 joint ventures involving a total of 229 firms . Each joint venture in our sample involves at least one US partner , to partially control for differences in US patenting activity between US and non - US firms . The nationality of the other partner is shown in Fig . 2 . Approximately 27 % of the joint ventures involve a pair of US firms , a slight under - representation compared to the overall CATI dataset . Japanese and European firms account for the majority of non - US partner firms in our sample of alliances , with 32 % each , and just 9 % are with non - US firms from a group of countries that includes Brazil , Canada , People’s Republic of China , South Korea , Thailand , and India . For each venture we record the identity of the partner firms , the stated motive for the alliance , and the stage in the innovation process that the alliance is reported to cover . This information also comes from CATI , and is based on a content analysis of the source documents from which the CATI data are drawn . For joint ventures , thirteen separate motives are distinguished . 12 For this analysis , we grouped the motives into ‘technology - re - 10 (cid:14) . The analysis was repeated with absolute i . e . , non - normalized cross - citation and common - citation measures , with no significant effect on our results . 11 The CATI data are based on systematic examination of secondary reports of alliance formation , primarily during the 1980s . Coverage of the overall population is inevitably incomplete , and significant biases remain , but CATI remains the most comprehensive and reliable source available for information on alliance activity in the global economy . 12 (cid:14) . For a complete list of the keywords used in the CATI content analysis , see Hagedoorn and Duysters 1993 . The description of motives is more complete for joint ventures than for other types of alliances in the CATI database . This was a primary consideration in restricting the initial sample to joint ventures . Subsequent samples included non - equity alliances , however , and our results were robust across samples .

(cid:14) . lated’ and ‘market - access’ categories see Table 2 . The CATI data also distinguish several stages in the (cid:14) . (cid:14) . innovation process in describing the primary activities of a joint venture : 1 basic research ; 2 development ; (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . 13 3 design ; 4 production ; and 5 ‘mixed’ . We grouped these into ‘R & D’ 1 – 3 and 5 and ‘Production’ 4 . The joint ventures in our sample are evenly split between technology - related and market access motives . The distribution is much more skewed , however , in the sample’s coverage of the stages of the innovation process : only 35 % of the joint ventures are engaged in pure production or marketing activities , and the remaining 65 % are involved primarily in product development , product design , or a mixture of these activities . Our data contain no bilateral joint ventures whose primary concern was basic research . 14 The patent data are drawn from the Micropatent database , which contains all information recorded on the front page of every patent granted in the US since 1975 . This information includes the patent number ; date of (cid:14) . application ; date of patent grant ; company to whom the patent is assigned if any ; and references to prior patents for each granted patent . All patents assigned to the firms appearing in the bilateral joint venture sample were extracted from the Micropatent database , and corporate patent portfolios were constructed . Since we focus on firm - specific capabilities , the relevant patent portfolio for the analysis is the portfolio of the entire firm , rather than that of any single subsidiary . The use of a corporate patent portfolio also is necessary because firms do not always assign a patent to the subsidiary in which the innovation took place and r or in which it is used . The first stage in the construction of our sample linked firms in the sample with their parent company and other subsidiaries . 15 We then created a patent portfolio for each firm that covered the 1975 – 1992 period by collecting information on each patent issued to the parent corporation and all of its subsidiaries . For the 229 firms in the sample , this resulted in a total of approximately 8700 subsidiary entities and more than 200 , 000 patents . The result of the data collection and tabulation process was a series of firm - specific patent portfolios , (cid:14) detailing for each patent its number , application date , issue date , patent class , and US references i . e . , patents . cited in the application . The number and vintage of the patents in each firm’s portfolio vary considerably , and the number of patents cited in any single patent ranges from 0 to approximately 80 , with a mean around 10 . The 13 (cid:14) . ‘Mixed’ i . e . , R & D and production transactions are included with R & D and design - only alliances , as previous empirical work has shown that these mixed transactions involve levels of complexity that are similar to those of R & D activities and have similar organizational (cid:14) . consequences Pisano , 1990 ; Oxley , 1995 . 14 This observation is consistent with received wisdom concerning joint research , i . e . , collaborative ventures focusing on basic research are (cid:14) . more likely to be multilateral arrangements Katz and Ordover , 1990 ; Grindley et al . , 1994 . Examination of the mean number of partners in joint ventures at different stages of the innovation process for the entire CATI dataset confirms this . The mean number of partners in basic R & D ventures is 3 . 1 , compared with an average of 2 . 1 – 2 . 3 firms in alliances that focus on later stages in the innovation process . 15 ( ) This was accomplished using the 1985 edition of Who Owns Whom North American Edition .

The patent cross - citation and common citation rates were computed for the partners in each venture before and 16 (cid:14) after the establishment of an alliance and for firms in the various control samples described below Table 3 . provides descriptive statistics for two of our samples . 6 . 2 . Methods (cid:14) Each of the hypotheses in Section 4 concerns differences in the level of technological overlap measured by . common citation or cross - citation rates between two samples of firms . H1 and H2 compare pre - alliance citations of collaborators and those of non - collaborators . H3 compares the post - alliance citation behavior of joint venture partners with citations among the same firm pairs prior to their alliance . H4 compares citations by collaborators in technology - based alliances with citations by firms in market - access alliances . H5 compares citations by partners in R & D alliances with those of firms in production or marketing alliances . We tested hypotheses H1 , H3 , H4 , and H5 with difference of means tests , and tested H2 with logit estimation . For ease of (cid:14) . presentation , we first discuss the tests of the differences of population means H1 and H3 – H5 , before considering the results of our logit specification and test of H2 . Testing hypothesis H1 requires the creation of a control sample of ‘non - partner’ firms—pairs of firms that did not form a joint venture in the sample period . Construction of such a sample , however , raises a number of questions . Should the sample of non - allies be drawn from the universe of all corporations , or all corporations that appear in the CATI database , a group firms that have demonstrated some ‘propensity to ally’ ? Is it reasonable to assume that any two firms in the CATI dataset are equally likely to ally ? To deal with these issues , we created two separate control samples . We compiled control sample a 1 , consisting of 150 pairs of non - collaborating firms , by generating random pairings of the firms in the original CATI - based sample . This has the advantage of pairing firms known to be active in joint ventures . But the sample’s pairing of firms in unrelated industries may result in low cross - citation and common citation rates in the control group for reasons entirely unrelated to issues of collaboration or non - collaboration . 16 The ‘before’ cross - and common citation rates were computed based on all patents applied for after January 1 , 1979 and issued before December 31 , 1984 . Only citations to patents issued after 1975 were included in the calculation , since this is the earliest year for which patent data were available , and so for patents issued before that data , the assignee is unknown . ‘After’ citation rates refer to patents with applications dated after January 1 , 1987 and issued prior to December 1 , 1992 . These cutoff dates were chosen to ensure that all applications (cid:14) . for patents included in the ‘before’ calculation were in fact made before the collaboration began i . e . , before 1985 and those in the ‘after’ (cid:14) . were filed after the latest joint venture in the sample was established i . e . , after 1986 . The empirical analysis was repeated with alternative cutoff dates and the results were generally insensitive to these changes . ( ) D . C .

R & D 2 . 515 5 . 205 0 . 011 20 . 918 To address this issue , we compiled a second control sample , using Compustat data to create a set of ‘matched (cid:14) pairs’ . For an alliance between Firm and Firm in the sample , we selected one partner at random let us assume i j . (cid:14) . it was Firm and found a ‘matching’ firm in the Compustat database Firm that most closely matched Firm i k i (cid:14) . (cid:14) . according to the following criteria : 1 Firm had the same primary 4 - digit SIC as Firm ; and 2 Firm was k i k (cid:14) . closest in size to Firm based on 1985 revenues , compared with all other firms in that 4 - digit SIC . We then i searched the CATI database to ensure that Firm did not form an alliance with Firm during the sample period k j (cid:14) . 1985 – 1986 . If this condition was satisfied , then Firm and Firm were entered as a ‘non - allied’ firm pair in k j the control sample . Reliance on Compustat data reduces the size of our original sample , since 73 % of the alliances in the original sample involved a non - US firm that was not included in the Compustat database . We therefore expanded the original alliance sample to include non - equity alliances , 17 resulting in a sample of 84 alliances and 84 ‘matched’ control pairs . This sample addresses the primary weakness of the first sample with respect to construction of the control firm pairs , but it has fewer observations and lacks complete information on motives for cooperation . 18 In addition to the difference of means tests , which employ citation rates as their dependent variables , we tested a model of partner selection using logit techniques and a different dependent variable , the formation of an alliance . Using a pooled sample of alliances and randomly generated control firm pairs , the dependent variable is coded one if the firm pair formed an alliance in 1985 – 1986 and zero otherwise . The patent cross - citation or common citation rate , along with other controls for firm effects , are the independent variables in this analysis . 17 These non - equity alliances include joint development and technology - sharing agreements , licensing arrangements and customer - supplier partnerships . 18 We also constructed a Compustat - based control population that consisted of 84 random pairings of firms within the CATI data for which Compustat data were available . This control group produced empirical results that were similar to those obtained from the ‘matched - pair’ control sample . ( ) D . C . Mowery et al . r Research Policy 27 1998 507 – 523 517 This model allows us to test for nonlinearities in the effects of technological overlap on partner selection , especially the possibility of diminishing returns to technological overlap . According to H2 , we expect technological overlap to be positively related to the likelihood of forming a joint venture at low and moderate levels of overlap , but this effect should become negative at higher levels of overlap . Thus we expect to find a positive coefficient for our citation terms and a negative coefficient for the square of these terms . The logit specification also allows us to examine other influences on partner selection . For example , the (cid:14) . study of Gulati 1995b regarding partner selection highlights the role of previous ties in the decision—firms tend to form new alliances with former partners . We therefore include a count of previous alliances connecting (cid:14) . the firm - pair in question i . e . , those alliances established prior to 1985 as an independent variable in the analysis . Other factors that may influence the partner selection decision are industry affiliation , firm size and overall technical capabilities , irrespective of overlap . We control for these effects by including in the model a (cid:14) dummy variable that is equal to one if the two firms are in the same 2 - digit SIC in alternate models we . substituted 3 - digit and 4 - digit SIC - level dummy variables , the log of the difference in size of the two firms (cid:14) . 19 measured by 1985 sales and the difference in R & D intensity of the firms . 6 . 3 . Results Results of the difference of means tests , comparing the average cross citation and common citation rates for the sub - samples featured in the hypotheses , are shown in Table 4a and b . The statistical significance of the (cid:14) . differences in these averages was assessed using a two - tailed t - test the t - statistic is shown in parentheses . (cid:14) . The tests on sample a 1 the sample of 150 joint ventures with a randomly generated control are shown in Table 4a , and provide mixed support for our hypotheses . We find that partners in joint ventures have (cid:14) significantly higher levels of technological overlap measured by either the patent cross - citation rate or the . common citation rate than non - partners , supporting hypothesis H1 . Furthermore , technological overlap between (cid:14) . joint venture partners after alliance formation is greater than their pre - alliance overlap H3 , although this result is only significant for the common - citation index . These two results suggest that technological overlap is a (cid:14) . significant factor in the partner selection decision , and that overlap increases moderately over the course of an alliance . Tests of hypotheses H4 and H5 yield less compelling results . Partners in technology - related joint ventures do not display higher levels of technological overlap than partners in market - access joint ventures , nor do we find (cid:14) . differences in overlap between firms in R & D and those in production joint ventures H5 . The data on which these motive and activity classifications are based are too imprecise to draw strong conclusions here ; nevertheless , they do not support the argument that the role of technological overlap in partner choice depends on the motives and r or purposes of the joint venture . Do international joint ventures differ from purely domestic alliances ? Partitioning the joint ventures into separate populations of US - only alliances and those linking US with non - US firms produces some interesting results . We find greater technological overlap in joint ventures linking US firms with non - US firms than in domestic joint ventures , although this result is significant only for common citation rates . This suggests that US firms may set a higher ‘overlap threshold’ in their decisions to ally with foreign firms than is characteristic of alliances with other US firms : a foreign firm’s technological capabilities must overlap with those of the US firm to a greater extent in order for a US firm to choose it as a joint venture partner . (cid:14) Table 4b contains the results of tests of H1 and H3 using the ‘matched - pairs’ control sample i . e . , sample . a 2 . Alliance partners have significantly greater technological overlap than non - allied company pairs , as measured by either common or cross - citation rates . The robustness of this result provides strong support for our central hypothesis that technological overlap is a significant factor in alliance partner choice . 19 The addition of these control variables relied on Compustat data , which meant that the logit analysis was carried out using the sample of 84 US - only alliances and a control sample generated by random pairing of the firms in those 84 alliances .

The results on pre - and post - alliance technological overlap are less clear—the effects are not statistically significant for either measure of overlap . One possible explanation for the mixed results on pre - versus post - alliance technological overlap is that some of the partners in our sample may have been involved in previous collaborations , increasing technological overlap for the pre - 1985 period . Controlling for previous alliance activity in the difference of means test , however , did not materially change the result . 20 The results of our logit model for the pooled alliance r non - alliance sample are shown in Table 5 . As (cid:14) . hypothesized in H2 , the results of our first specification Model 1 show that the likelihood that a particular pair of firms will be linked in an alliance is positively related to the patent cross - citation rate and negatively related to the square of the cross - citation rate , with both effects significant at the 1 % level . Higher levels of 20 (cid:14) . Nakamura , Shaver and Yeung 1996 suggest the presence of offsetting changes in joint venture partners’ capabilities that may explain the weak results for H3 . According to these authors , partner firms’ technological capabilities may evolve in either a ‘convergent’ or a (cid:14) . ‘divergent’ direction . Increased similarity in partner capabilities ‘convergent development’ results from organizational learning within the (cid:14) . alliance . On the other hand , increased dissimilarity ‘divergent development’ may occur if an alliance leads partner firms to specialize in certain activities . Our sample apparently includes some alliances exhibiting convergent development and some alliances with divergent (cid:14) . development , weakening our tests of changes in technological overlap as a result of alliance participation . Cantwell and Barrera 1996 (cid:14) examine the effects of participation in interwar cartels on firms’ technological profiles as measured by the revealed technological advantage . in their patent portfolios and find evidence of divergence among firms in electrical equipment and convergence among firms in the chemicals industry . The very small number of observations in their empirical analysis , however , means that these results are no more than suggestive . ( ) D . C .

Standard errors in parentheses . technological overlap thus seem to exert a diminishing influence on partner choice in an alliance . When the (cid:14) . common citation rate is substituted for cross - citations model 4 , the observed effect is similar , although the square term is significant only at the 5 % level . The overall predictive power of these simple models is good : the ‘correct’ prediction regarding partner choice is made for 63 % and 67 % of the observations for cross - citations and common citations , respectively . 21 21 (cid:14) The broad similarity of results obtained with the two different measures of technological overlap i . e . , cross citation and common . citation rates is itself of interest . Although common citation rates are usually higher than cross - citation rates , as one would expect , they appear to be fairly close substitutes in terms of their performance as measures of technological overlap . In other words , partner choice is positively influenced by greater similarity in firms’ pre - alliance exploitation of pools of intellectual property external to both enterprises , as well as by more direct similarity in their technological portfolios . ( ) D . C . Mowery et al . r Research Policy 27 1998 507 – 523 520 (cid:14) Models 2 and 5 show the effect of previous alliance activity on partner selection . As hypothesized and . consistent with Gulati’s results , a firm is more likely to choose a previous ally over an ‘unknown’ firm when establishing a new alliance . 22 Addition of the ‘previous alliances’ variable improves the performance of the models ; likelihood ratio test statistics are significant at the 1 % level and correct predictions are higher , at 69 . 6 % and 73 . 2 % . But the addition of this variable does not significantly change the observed effect of technological (cid:14) . overlap on partner selection . Some of the importance in alliance partner choice ascribed by Gulati 1995a , b to the ‘social connections’ among firms that result from prior alliances may instead reflect similarities in their technological capabilities . (cid:14) . Addition of the other firm characteristics to our original specification models 3 and 6 also does not eliminate the technological overlap effect , except for a loss of significance for the common - citation - squared term . The ‘same industry’ variable has a statistically significant effect on partner choice , suggesting that firms prefer to ally with partners from the same industrial sector . 23 This result may indicate the influence of some (cid:14) . other form of complementarity or ‘strategic interdependence’ Gulati , 1995b , in addition to that of technologi - cal overlap . Our measure of differences in firm size has a positive effect on alliance formation , suggesting that large firms ally with small firms rather than with other large firms . This result may reflect the large number of biotechnology alliances in our data , but it is consistent with Gulati’s empirical results . R & D intensity does not appear to play an important role in the partner selection decision . Likelihood ratio tests indicate that the addition of this vector of firm characteristics significantly improves the performance of the model at the 1 % level . (cid:14) The results displayed in Table 5 demonstrate consistent support for the hypothesized direction and . significance of technological overlap and its square term . The coefficients for the cross - and common - citation variables suggest that increased technological overlap has a negative effect on partner selection for pre - alliance cross - citation rates above 9 . 5 and common - citation rates above 30 , which are well within the observable range of our data . These results support H2’s prediction of an inverted - U relationship between technological overlap and partner choice . 7 . Conclusions and extensions The resource - based view of the firm has considerable potential for extension to a broad array of strategy and technology management issues . Among the greatest virtues of this framework is its restoration of the firm to center stage in both theoretical and empirical work . Rather than treating the firm as a black box , the resource - based view emphasizes the origins , acquisition , maintenance and erosion of firms’ capabilities . This brings into focus issues of organization , management and strategy that have not been well integrated into mainstream economic theory and that remain on the periphery of much research in strategic management . One weakness of prior research on the resource - based view of the firm is the lack of empirical work measuring the level and evolution of firm - specific capabilities . In this paper , we have analyzed the influence of firms’ technological capabilities on partner choice in alliances . On the whole , hypotheses based on the resource - based view of the firm perform well in explaining the choice of alliance partners in this modest sample . Partner selection can be crudely predicted by measures of technological overlap and participation in alliances appears to affect firms’ technological portfolios in ways predicted by the resource - based view of the firm . Our 22 (cid:14) . (cid:14) Gulati 1995b also includes the square of previous alliances to test for diminishing returns to this effect he finds a significant negative . coefficient for this variable . We included a square term in several estimations not reported here . In all cases , our estimation yielded an (cid:14) . insignificant albeit negative coefficient for this variable . 23 Similar results were obtained using ‘same industry’ measures that used 3 - digit or 4 - digit SIC codes , although the 4 - digit SIC measures were not significant . ( ) D . C . Mowery et al . r Research Policy 27 1998 507 – 523 521 results suggest that technological capabilities may be no less important in alliance partner choice than the ‘social (cid:14) . network’ factors emphasized by Gulati 1995a , b . One extension of the research reported here seeks measures that can distinguish between technological similarity and technological complementarity in explaining partner choice , along the lines suggested by (cid:14) . Nakamura et al . 1996 . Our measure of technological overlap is arguably a good proxy for similarity of technological assets , but does not capture possible technological complementarities . ‘Different but complemen - tary’ resources are those owned by one firm that can be exploited in the operations of the partner through an alliance . The ‘field of use’ information provided in the Micropatent data may prove useful in developing a measure of technological complementarity : If Firm increasingly obtains patents for innovations whose primary i (cid:14) . field of use is in Firm ’s the joint venture partner’s business area , and vice versa , then the complementarity of j the two firms’ patent portfolios can be said to be increasing , regardless of trends in measured technological overlap . Combining this measure with our measures of technological overlap may provide further useful insights into the impact of interfirm alliances on the resource base of participating firms . Another approach to the analysis of alliances’ effects on firm - specific capabilities focuses on the ‘vintage’ of the patents cited by partners before and during their alliance . Alliances may accelerate the interfirm spillovers that are reflected in patterns of patent cross - citation among partner firms . If this hypothesis is correct , alliance partners should cite more recent components of one another’s patent portfolio . Yet another area for future work concerns the integration of alliance formation with other elements of firm (cid:14) . strategy , such as purposive diversification . Drawing on the empirical work of Silverman 1996 , we can combine data on alliance formation by US firms with data on their diversification activities , facilitating the development of an integrated analysis on the decision to pursue diversification through an alliance , as opposed to doing so through alternative strategies such as acquisition or internal development . Our indicators of technological overlap also could provide insights into the longevity and stability of alliances . Empirical tests of the resource - based view of the firm impose great demands for data and requirements for compromise on researchers . Nevertheless , this approach to understanding and analyzing firm strategy holds considerable promise for future empirical work .
