Craig Keywords : actin ; myosin VI ; calmodulin ; cooperativity ; phosphorescencespectroscopy The contractile and enzymatic activities of myosin VI are regulated by calcium binding to associated calmodulin ( CaM ) light chains . We have used transient phosphorescence anisotropy to monitor the microsecond rota - tional dynamics of erythrosin - iodoacetamide - labeled actin with strongly bound myosin VI ( MVI ) and to evaluate the effect of MVI - bound CaM light chain on actin filament dynamics . MVI binding lowers the amplitude but accelerates actin filament microsecond dynamics in a Ca 2 + - and CaM - dependent manner , as indicated from an increase in the final anisotropy and a decrease in the correlation time of transient phosphorescence anisotropy decays . MVI with bound apo - CaM or Ca 2 + – CaM weakly affects actin filament microsecond dynamics , relative to other myosins ( e . g . , muscle myosin II and myosin Va ) . CaM dissociation from bound MVI damps filament rotational dynamics ( i . e . , increases the torsional rigidity ) , such that the perturbation is comparable to that induced by other characterized myosins . Analysis of individual actin filament shape fluctuations imaged by fluorescence microscopy reveals a correlated effect on filament bending mechanics . These data support a model in which Ca 2 + - dependent CaM binding to the IQ domain of MVI is linked to an allosteric reorganization of the actin binding site ( s ) , which alters the structural dynamics and the mechanical rigidity of actin filaments . Such modulation of filament dynamics may contribute to the Ca 2 + - and CaM - dependent regulation of myosin VI motility and ATP utilization . © 2011 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . .

However , since biochemical studies indicate functional interdependence ( i . e . , coupling ) of the actin and light chain binding domains of several myosins , the two issues are linked , and these interrelations must be elucidated for a complete molecular understanding of myo - sin - based motility . The essential light chain isoform bound to skeletal muscle myosin strongly influences actin - activated ATPase , 1 in vitro motility sliding velocity of actin filaments , 2 and the ability of the S1 motor domain to accelerate actin polymerization . 3 Actin - activated ATPase of smooth muscle myosin is regulated by phosphorylation - induced structural transitions in the N - terminal region of bound light chains . 4 The activity of molluscan striated muscle myosin is regulated by Ca 2 + binding to the regulatory light chain . 5 Light chain regulation of actin – myosin interac - tions requires long - range allosteric communication between the actin and light chain binding regions of myosin . Crystal structures of muscle and non - muscle myosins indicate that small movements within the myosin motor domain can be transmit - ted through the converter domain to the light chain binding region . 6 , 7 Functional interdepen - dence between the motor properties of myosin and the light chain binding domain is particularly clear in myosin VI ( herein referred to as MVI ) — the only known myosin family member that moves toward the pointed end of actin filaments rather than the barbed end . 7 MVI achieves reverse directionality by rotating its lever arm in the direction opposite to that of other myosins . Such rotation is probably enabled by the presence of a unique insert between the converter and the calmodulin ( CaM ) light chain binding ( IQ ) do - main , which influences coupling between the light chain binding domain orientation and the nucleo - tide and actin binding sites . 7 , 8 The insert and IQ domains of MVI each bind a single CaM molecule . It has been suggested that the insert - bound CaM principally plays a structur - al role and the IQ - bound CaM may be involved in Ca 2 + - regulation MVI function , 9 namely , slowing actin motility , actin - activated ATPase , and ADP release . 10 , 11 Early studies using gel densitometry showed that binding of CaM to MVI HMM dimers is not affected by Ca 2 + up to ∼ 100 μ M . 10 Mass spectrometry confirms that CaM binding to the insert and to the IQ region is Ca 2 + independent and that CaM binds with a higher affinity ( K d ∼ 30 nM ) to the insert domain . 9 Furthermore , structural analysis by cryo - electron microscopy shows that Ca 2 + weakens CaM binding to the IQ domain , but not to the insert . 12 Since CaM binds the insert region of MVI independent of calcium with a high affinity , 9 while Ca 2 + weakens the affinity of CaM for the IQ domain of MVI , 12 it is possible that CaM binding and / or a CaM - linked conformation of the IQ domain modulates actin filament stiffening . There is increasing evidence that actin filaments adopt multiple conformational states and that the equilibria among these states are modulated by interaction with regulatory proteins , including myosin contractile proteins . 13 , 14 Numerous studies have shown that changes in the structural state ( s ) of actin modulate filament sliding and actomyosin ATPase 15 , 16 and that the effect of myosin on actin structure depends on the structural states of myosin . 17 – 19 The impact of Ca 2 + – CaM regulation on the interaction between MVI and actin in terms of actin structural properties is less clear . We initiated this study to determine whether Ca 2 + – CaM regulation of MVI involves allosteric modulation of the actin binding regions that modulates the structural state fluctuations of actin . We measured the actin filament microsecond dynamics using transient phosphorescence anisot - ropy ( TPA ) and the actin filament flexural rigidity from images of thermally driven filament shape conformations acquired using fluorescence micros - copy . Previously , we demonstrated that the struc - tural dynamics of actin is an important determinant of functional properties of the acto - myosin complex . 17 , 18 , 20 The present results with MVI reveal that the actomyosin interface and resulting changes in filament dynamics can be allosterically regulated by ligand - linked changes in the light chain binding domain of myosin . Results and Discussion Effects of MVI on actin TPA decays MVI binding affects the TPA decays of actin filaments in a Ca 2 + - and CaM - dependent manner ( Fig . 1 ) . In the presence of free calcium ( 200 μ M ) and no added CaM , MVI substantially increases the final anisotropy , corresponding to a reduction in the amplitude of filament microsecond rota - tional dynamics ( i . e . , torsional stiffening ; Fig . 1 , red ) , as observed with other myosin isoforms . 19 However , the effects of bound MVI are substan - tially diminished in the absence of calcium ( i . e . , with bound apo - CaM ; Fig . 1 , blue ) or upon addition of 30 μ M Ca 2 + – CaM ( Fig . 1 , green ) . Equilibrium binding assays confirm that MVI binds actin stoichiometrically under these condi - tions ( Fig . 2 ) , indicating that the observed effects reflect Ca 2 + - and CaM - dependent structural changes in actomyosin VI . Calcium and / or CaM alone has negligible effects on the TPA decays of bare actin ( data not shown ) . 585 Actin Filament Dynamics in Actomyosin VI Complex Author ' s personal copy Ca 2 + and CaM dependence of MVI effects on actin torsional dynamics We evaluated the CaM dependence of actin TPA decays , specifically the final anisotropy and the average correlation time [ Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and Fig . 3 ] , with sub - stoichiometric MVI ( myosin VI binding density = 0 . 25 ) to determine if torsional stiffening of actin filaments by MVI is regulated by CaM . The final anisotropy and the average correlation time of actin depend hyperbolically [ Eq . ( 3 ) ] on the [ CaM ] when Ca 2 + is saturating 9 , 11 ( Fig . 3 ) , yielding an apparent binding affinity ( K d ) of 0 . 6 μ M ( final anisotropy ) to 1 . 5 μ M ( average correlation time ) for Ca 2 + – CaM binding to the IQ domain of MVI . Ca 2 + – [ CaM ] - dependent changes in the individual compo - nent anisotropy amplitudes ( r 1 and r 2 ) and correla - tion times ( ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 ) yield essentially identical results as the final anisotropy and average correla - tion time ( Fig . 4 ; K d = 0 . 5 – 1 . 2 μ M ) . Thus , Ca 2 + – CaM similarly affects both slow ( r 1 , ϕ 1 ) and fast ( r 2 , ϕ 2 ) components of the anisotropy decays . We conclude , in agreement with cryo - electron microscopy Fig . 2 .

The continuous line is the best fit to a quadratic binding expression using the binding affinities 21 and total reactant concentrations , 22 , 23 yielding binding stoichiometries of 0 . 98±0 . 07 and 0 . 98±0 . 04 in the presence and absence of Ca 2 + , respectively .

Bare actin ( gray ) is shown for comparison . Smooth lines represent fits to the sum of two exponential terms [ Eq . ( 1 ) ] . Both panels show the same data over different timescales . 586 Actin Filament Dynamics in Actomyosin VI Complex Author ' s personal copy studies , 12 that Ca 2 + lowers the CaM binding affinity of MVI and exogenous CaM is needed to saturate the IQ domain of MVI ; binding to the insert IQ peptide is much tighter ( K d ∼ 30 nM ) and independent of calcium . 9 Inclusion of exogenous CaM in the absence of calcium [ 1 mM ethylene glycol bis ( β - aminoethyl ether ) N , N ′ - tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) present ] has no detectable effect on the TPA decays ( Fig . 3 ) . The simplest explanation of this result is that MVI is saturated with CaM from the initial purification and this endogenous CaM binds MVI with high affinity ( K d b 130 nM ) in the absence of Ca 2 + . Thus , three distinct states that differentially affect actin rota - tional dynamics exist , and their distribution is dictated by the CaM and Ca 2 + concentrations . Allostery of MVI effects on actin torsional dynamics in the presence and absence of calcium and CaM Experiments thus far ( Figs . 1 – 4 ) evaluate the effects of CaM at a single bound MVI concentration . We have previously shown that the perturbation of actin filament microsecond torsional dynamics by various myosin isoforms displays non - nearest - neighbor ( i . e . , long range ) cooperative interactions , such that an individual bound myosin influences the dynamics of ∼ 10 unoccupied filament subunits . 19 For determination of whether and how the extent of filament saturation with MVI affects the regulatory effects of CaM , actin was titrated with MVI in the presence of calcium without and with CaM added at saturating ( 30 μ M ) concentration as well as in the absence of calcium , and the MVI - induced changes in the final anisotropy and average correlation time were fitted to a one - dimensional lattice model [ Eq . ( 4 ) and Fig . 5 ] . In the presence of Ca 2 + but absence of CaM , the increase in final anisotropy is highly cooperative , and a single bound MIV affects the dynamics of 8 . 5±2 . 7 filament subunits , similar to that observed for myosin Va . 19 A comparable cooperative unit ( N = 8 . 2±3 . 7 ) is observed in the reduction in the average correlation time . Either addition of CaM in the presence of calcium ( Ca 2 + – CaM ) or removal of calcium by EGTA ( apo - CaM ) , two conditions favoring CaM bound at the MVI IQ domain , has substantial effects on actin dynamics . Cooperative changes in final anisotropy for Ca 2 + – CaM and apo - CaM are less pronounced ( N = 4 . 6±0 . 1 and N = 6 . 1±1 , respectively ) , with a modest reduction in the magnitude of change in final anisotropy . The effects on the correlation time are noncooperative ( Fig . 5 ) . These data indicate that three MVI states with distinct actin filament Fig . 4 .

Uncertainty bars represent 1 SD from the mean . 587 Actin Filament Dynamics in Actomyosin VI Complex Author ' s personal copy interactions and cooperativity ( Table 1 ) exist in a reversible Ca 2 + - and CaM - linked equilibrium ( Table 1 ) . MVI with bound apo - CaM or Ca 2 + – CaM weakly affects actin filament microsecond torsional dynamics compared to other myosins ( e . g . , muscle myosin II and myosin Va 19 ) . CaM dissociation from bound MVI stiffens filaments ( Fig . 6 ) , to an extent comparable to that of other myosins . 19 Ca 2 + - and CaM - dependent modulation of acto - MIV filament dynamics may contribute to regulation of myosin VI motility and ATP utilization . 10 , 11 Bending persistence length of actomyosin VI filaments modulated by Ca 2 + and CaM We determined the actin and filament bending persistence length , L p , by fitting the two - dimension - al ( 2D ) average cosine correlation function , h C ( s ) i , to the average cosine of correlated tangential angles ( θ ) along segment lengths of actin filaments . 24 , 25 MVI increases the actin filament L p from 8 . 8±0 . 8 μ m to 15±1 μ m ( in the presence of 1 mM EGTA ; Fig . 6 ) . Adding 200 μ M Ca 2 + to actomyosin VI dissociates myosin - bound CaM and stiffens filaments , as indicated by a higher L p of 23±2 μ m ( Fig . 6 ) . When additional CaM is supplemented to favor Ca 2 + – CaM binding , actomyosin VI filaments have an L p of 14±1 μ m ( in the presence of 200 μ M Ca 2 + and 30 μ M CaM ; Fig . 6 ) , which is comparable to actomyosin MVI in the presence of 1 mM EGTA . These measurements indicate that myosin - VI - , Ca2 + - , and CaM - dependent changes in actin Table 1 .

Origin of CaM - dependent actomyosin VI filament dynamics CaM - regulated dynamics of actomyosin VI ( Figs . 3 and 5 ) does not result from CaM binding to actin ( e . g . , bound CaM interaction with actin ' s C - terminus , as observed for the essential light chain of muscle S1 26 ) since the light chain binding domain of actin - bound MVI points away from the actin filament , while that of muscle myosin II and MV tilt toward the filament . 7 , 8 It is more likely that CaM - regulated dynamics of MVI - bound actin occur via allosteric structural changes at the actin binding regions of MVI that originate from the light chain binding IQ domain . Reorganization of the actomyosin interface presumably compro - mises the energy and / or interface area between filament subunits , which influences the filament compliance . 27 We observe a remarkable agreement between MVI - induced changes in the microsecond torsional rigidity and the millisecond flexural rigidity of actin filaments ( Fig . 7 ) . Correlated , but opposite , changes in the twisting and bending motions of actin filaments are induced by cofilin — bound cofilin lowers the torsional 28 and flexural rigidity of actin filaments . 25 These observations are consistent with a coupling between actin filament twisting and bending motions . 27 The non - nearest - neighbor ef - fects on filament dynamics and elasticity could influence the stepping behavior of dimeric myosin VI and interaction with filament regulatory proteins . Actin subdomains 1 and 2 are regions likely to be affected by MVI binding as it results in reorgani - zation of the actomyosin interface . 29 We expect MVI - induced changes in subdomain 1 to be subtle since the phosphorescence lifetime of erythrosin iodoacetamide ( ErIA ) - actin ( 156 . 8±5 . 4 μ s ) — a sen - sitive indicator of accessibility of the probe envi - ronment — is not significantly affected by MVI either in the absence of Ca 2 + – CaM ( 148 . 4±3 . 6 μ s ) or in the presence of 30 μ M CaM ( 137 . 1 μ s ) . Alteration of the DNase loop within actin sub - domain 2 has been implicated in determination of actin mechanical properties , 30 as well as the dynamics and distribution of structural states within actin filaments , particularly upon interaction with a variety of actin - binding proteins . 13 , 25 , 28 , 31 – 33 The increased flexibility and dynamics of cofilin - decorated actin filaments were interpreted in terms of possible disruption of stabilizing inter - subunit contacts , particularly contacts involving subdomain 2 induced by rearrangement of the DNase loop . 25 , 33 It is possible that MVI stiffens actin filaments by stabilizing the same DNase - loop - mediated intersubunit contacts that modulate the dynamics and rigidity of actin filaments . MVI could potentially favor formation of a subset of the various actin filament subunit solution conformations . 13 , 14 Differences in the TPA of MVI as compared to other myosins ( e . g . , final anisotropy , correlation time , or cooperativity 19 ) may reflect different distributions of the various filament thermal conformers that are populated with bound myosin . Implications for biological functions of MVI The effects of Ca 2 + – CaM on the dynamics of actomyosin VI could potentially have functional implications . MVI stiffens actin filaments and possibly makes them more resistant to fragmen - tation , similar as bound MV , 19 dystrophin , and utrophin . 34 MVI is present in many non - muscle cells , and Ca 2 + - associated modulation of actomy - osin VI stiffness may be one of the structural determinants of the mechanical properties of actin bundles such as in hair cells in the inner ear . 35 Studies on the dynamics of hair bundles indicate that the bundle stiffness increases with Ca 2 + concentration , interpreted as Ca 2 + modulation of actin filament stiffness . 36 A significant increase in the hair bundle stiffness is observed at ∼ 200 μ M Ca 2 + , 36 which agrees with the increased actin filament stiffness upon the addition of MVI and 200 μ M Ca 2 + observed here . Thus , Ca 2 + regula - tion of CaM binding to the IQ domain of MVI ( i . e . , by Ca 2 + fluxes in the inner ear ) likely enhances the “ grip ” of MVI on actin filaments and the mechanical stiffness of actin - based cyto - skeletal structures .

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean . 589 Actin Filament Dynamics in Actomyosin VI Complex Author ' s personal copy Materials and Methods Protein preparations Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and labeled with ErIA ( AnaSpec ) 17 or pyrene - iodoacetamide ( Invitrogen ) at Cys374 or Alexa 488 succinimidyl ester ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) and gel filtered . 25 , 32 A labeling efficiency with ErIA of 0 . 83±0 . 13 ( mean±SD , n = 11 ) was determined from the absorbance at 538 nm using an extinction coefficient of 83 , 000 37 and ∼ 0 . 8 for Alexa 488 . Freshly prepared ErIA - labeled actin was immediately stabilized against label - induced destabiliza - tion by adding a molar equivalent of phalloidin . Actin - bound Ca 2 + was exchanged for Mg 2 + with 200 μ M EGTA and 80 μ M MgCl 2 immediately before polymerization . Single - headed porcine myosin VI ( T406A mutant ; trun - cated at Gly840 ) with bound CaM light chain 21 – 23 was purified from Sf9 cells by Flag affinity chromatography . The purity was N 98 % for all preparations . CaM was purified from Escherichia coli using calcium - dependent hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl Sepharose 4B . 38 TPA experiments Phalloidin - stabilized ErIA - F - actin was diluted in KMg50 buffer [ 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) with 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 or 1 mM EGTA ] to 0 . 5 μ M , and 0 . 05 – 0 . 6 μ M MVI was added to form the actomyosin VI complexes , as indicated in the text . To remove residual ATP and ADP from actin , we incubated all samples prior to measurement for 20 min with 0 . 5 units / ml apyrase . To prolong the excited - state lifetime and prevent photo - bleaching of the dye , we removed oxygen from the sample by 5 min of incubation with glucose oxidase ( 55 μ g / ml ) , catalase ( 36 μ g / ml ) , and glucose ( 45 μ g / ml ) . 17 TPA data analysis : Model - independent fit to the sum of exponentials Time - resolved phosphorescence anisotropy was mea - sured at 25 °C as described previously 19 by recording 30 cycles of 1000 laser pulses ( 500 in each orientation of the polarizer ) . The initial anisotropy r 0 , rotational correlation times ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 , and corresponding amplitudes r 1 and r 2 were determined by fitting the anisotropy to the sum of two exponential terms and a constant r ∞ as described previously : 20 r t ð Þ = r 1 exp − t = f 1 ð Þ + r 2 exp − t = f 2 ð Þ + r l ð 1 Þ The time course of TPA decay was fitted in the 10 - to 500 - μ s time range . The fit quality indicated residuals b 2 % of the signal . Extending the fit to the full scale of decay ( 1 ms ) increased the residuals due to lower signal - to - noise ratio at long times but yielded r ∞ values within 5 % of the calculated average r ( t ) in the 400 - to 500 - μ s time range , since the decays are nearly completed within this timescale . The calculated average value of r ( t ) in the 400 - to 500 - μ s time range has been shown previously to provide the most sensitive and precise measurement of actin ' s microsecond rotational dynamics 20 and therefore was defined as the final anisotropy , determining the amplitude of microsecond timescale motions in actin .

The effects of bound MVI on the observed final anisotropy ( r obs ) of actin were analyzed in terms of the linear one - dimensional lattice model with non - nearest - neighbor interactions , 20 , 39 in which binding to an individ - ual actin filament subunit allosterically affects the dynam - ics of a filament segment containing N protomers according to : y = y max − y max − y actin ð Þ 1 − v ð Þ N ð 4 Þ where y actin and y max are the limiting values of final anisotropy and average correlation time 〈 ϕ 〉 at 0 and infinite concentrations of MVI , respectively , and v is the MVI binding density ( i . e . , bound [ MVI ] / [ actin ] ) .

Steady - state fluorescence intensities were measured using a Photon Technologies International ( New Brunswick , NJ ) Alphascan fluores - cence spectrometer . Determination of filament flexural rigidity Cation - exchanged Alexa - 488 - labeled actin was poly - merized in KMg50 buffer and equilibrated with and without saturating concentrations of myosin VI .

Analysis of filaments undergoing thermal fluctuations and those adsorbed to poly - L - lysine - treated slides yielded comparable results . 24 Images of individual filaments were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a Cool - snap HQ cooled CCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Tucson , AZ ) and μ Manager , processed using imageJ † and ana - lyzed with a code written in Matlab ( The Mathworks , Natick , MA ) as described previously . 25 The bending persistence length ( L p ) was determined by fitting the average of N 100 angular ( θ ) cosine correlation measure - ments h C ( s ) i of a segment length , s , corrected for measurement variance , to the following 2D correlation function : h C s ð Þi = h cos u s ð Þ − u 0 ð Þ ½ (cid:2)i = e − s 2 L p ð 7 Þ Statistical analysis of data Each result is reported as mean±standard error of the mean , unless indicated otherwise .
