In this research line we investigate how to develop DSLs that can leverage well know HPC technologies such as MPI or OmpSs . Summary Developing complex scientific applications on High Performance Computing systems requires both domain knowledge and expertise in parallel and distributed programming models . Domain Specific Languages ( DSLs ) are a promising approach to hide the complexity of HPC systems , apply domain specific optimizations and boost programmer’s productivity . The following figure shows how we think that applications should be designed : Our vision is that applications should be written using DSLs , which have a high - level syntax and domain optimizations . Internally , these DSLs should be implemented using programming models that hide the complexity related to the hardware where these applications will be executed . Objectives The main objectives of this researh line are : Experiment with DSL development platforms Develop new domain specific languages for different fields Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación Source URL ( retrieved on 29 Mar 2019 - 08 : 39 ) : https : / / www . bsc . es / ca / research - development / research - areas / programming - models / domain - specific - languages
