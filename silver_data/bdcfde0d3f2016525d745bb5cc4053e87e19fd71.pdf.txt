However , evidence for enteric involvement is emerging . 3 – 6 Recently , a multicentre study 7 in Hubei province ( China ) indicated that gastrointestinal symptoms were common in patients with COVID - 19 . We examined the intestinal symptoms of patients with COVID - 19 from multiple medical centres located in and outside of Hubei province . We retrospectively analysed data from 232 patients who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) RNA admitted to 14 hospitals ( two hospitals in Guangdong province , two in Hubei province , and ten in Jiangxi province ) between Jan 19 , 2020 , and March 6 , 2020 . Most patients were admitted because of fever , cough , dyspnoea , and chest CT findings consistent with COVID - 19 pneumonia . Diagnosis of COVID - 19 was based on positive SARS - CoV - 2 RNA tests . Two patients with pre - existing digestive diseases were excluded from our analysis . The analysis was approved by the institutional review boards of Sun Yat - sen University and the participating hospitals . Full details of the methods used are in the appendix ( p 1 ) . The clinical and demographic characteristics of the 230 patients analysed are shown in the appendix ( p 2 ) . There were 129 men and 101 women ; median age was 47·5 years ( range 7 – 90 ) . The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever ( 193 [ 84 % ] patients ) , cough ( 159 [ 69 % ] patients ) , and sputum production ( 98 [ 43 % ] patients ) . Diarrhoea was observed in 49 ( 21 % ) patients . Patients with diarrhoea were older and were more likely to have comorbidities than patients without diarrhoea ( table ) . A greater proportion of patients admitted to hospital had diarrhoea as the outbreak progressed : nine ( 43 % ) of 21 patients admitted between Feb 12 and March 6 , 2020 , had diarrhoea versus 40 ( 19 % ) of 209 patients admitted between Jan 19 and Feb 11 , 2020 . More patients with diarrhoea showed severe symptoms of pneumonia than those without diarrhoea , with an adjusted ( for age , sex , and comorbidities ) odds ratio ( OR ) of 4·95 ( 95 % CI 2·14 – 11·70 , p = 0·0002 ) . Although there was no correlation between diarrhoea and oxygen supplementation , a greater proportion of patients with diarrhoea required ventilator support ( adjusted OR 6·52 [ 95 % CI 1·44 – 35·86 ] , p = 0·018 ) and required admission to intensive care ( 3·19 [ 1·25 – 8·16 ] , p = 0·015 ) . Most laboratory test results did not differ significantly between patients with and without diarrhoea ( table ) . A similar proportion of patients with and without diarrhoea were given antibiotics and antiviral medications ( table ) . Less frequent gastrointestinal symptoms included bloody stool ( ten [ 4 % ] of 230 patients ) and abdominal pain ( three [ 1 % ] of 230 patients ) .

Our observations of patients with COVID - 19 from medical centres within and outside of Hubei province ( appendix pp 3 – 5 ) are consistent with other reports 3 – 9 showing gastrointestinal involvement in COVID - 19 . Many of these studies 3 – 9 reported patients with COVID - 19 who only had gastrointestinal symptoms during the course of the illness , and another study 2 reported patients with COVID - 19 who presented with diarrhoea 1 – 2 days before the development of fever and dyspnoea . We noted correlations between the presence of diarrhoea and the severity of respiratory symptoms , and found that more patients with diarrhoea required ventilator support and were admitted to intensive care than those without diarrhoea . Similarly , during the SARS outbreak in 2003 , more patients with SARS who had diarrhoea required ventilator support and were admitted to intensive care than those who did not have diarrhoea . 10 Understanding the mechanism underlying these correlations could help to identify novel intervention strategies to reduce or prevent severe outcomes of COVID - 19 . The proportion of patients with COVID - 19 who had gastrointestinal symptoms in our analysis ( 21 % with diarrhoea ) is higher than that observed in earlier reports ( 2 – 3 % with diarrhoea 1 , 11 ) . Similarly , a greater proportion of patients admitted to hospital had diarrhoea as the outbreak progressed . This difference could be due to a heightened awareness of the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID - 19 among clinicians . Additionally , the passing of time could have allowed the virus to accumulate mutations that might have affected its tropism for the intestines . The difference could also reflect geographic differences between populations studied ( ie , early studies from Wuhan vs our patients from four other cities ) . The increasing number of patients with COVID - 19 who have gastrointestinal symptoms warrants further study . A potential limitation of our analysis is the absence of data on the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID - 19 . It is likely that more asymptomatic patients existed , leading to an overestimation of the proportion of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms . Another possible confounding factor is that the antivirals , lopinavir and ritonavir , are known to cause diarrhoea . However , we did not observe a correlation between diarrhoea and use of antiviral medicine or antibiotics . All authors declare no competing interests .
