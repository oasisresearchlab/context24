In our prototype , the protagonist’s ‘fortune’ is controllable . The writer first decides the protagonist’s name ( A1 ) , writes a portion of a story ( A2 ) , and then sketches how the protagonist’s fortune should change in the story ( A3 , green shaded area ) . The 𝑥 position of the sketched line indicates the chronological position in the story ( sentences are the units ) . The 𝑦 position shows how good or bad the protagonist’s fortune should be ( higher , better ) . The width of the line indicates the possible variance in the fortune of the generated sentences . Given the line sketch , TaleBrush will generate story sentences ( B1 , indicated with blue ) and visualize the result on the original sketch ( B2 , the blue line and dots ) . The writer can always directly edit the generated text . They can also iterate by generating new text for the same sketch ( B3 , clicking on ‘Generating Again’ ) or revising their sketch and generating new text . Additional options allow the writer to specify how ‘surprising’ the generation should be ( B4 ) or using the eraser tool ( B5 ) to erase their sketch . Where the line is erased , TaleBrush generates unconstrained sentences . A history dropdown ( B6 ) allows the writer to browse previously generated sentences .

In many of these tools , the story co - creation process is iterative [ 24 , 28 , 29 , 51 , 143 ] : first , a writer gives the initial story sentences , such as “Melissa fought a dragon . ” Then , using the writer’s sentence as a prompt , the AI tool appends story sentences or phrases . For example , the tool can generate : “She used magic to create a barrier around her . ” The writer can modify the story directly , start from scratch , hoping for better results , or continue the iterative process by adding another sentence . However , consider a case where the writer has some idea of how the story should unfold . They would like to build tension for Melissa by giving her some bad luck with the dragon and only in the end boost her fortune . Unfortunately , steering the text generation in this way is hard both from the algorithmic and interaction perspective . First , most controlled story generation algorithms , which can be guided with inputs like topical keywords , apply the same control to the whole generated story . However , as the writer wanted Melissa to experience bad luck first and then end up with a happy ending , they would need to specify different parameters to different parts of the story . Such granular sequence control is not yet possible in many controlled story generation algorithms . Second , even when the generation algorithm allows such granular sequence control , existing interfaces ( e . g . , text inputs or sliders ) are not intuitive or useful for controlling or sensemaking in the generative process . For example , when there is a series of granular controls ( e . g . , sliders ) , specifying them can be cumbersome ( e . g . , inputting multiple nu - merical control values ) . Sensemaking , or understanding what the algorithm will do , or has done , is similarly difficult . To understand if the generated story follows the given parameters , writers have to compare each generated story part with each granular parameter . These frictions make iterative co - creation slow and effortful . Figure 2 : Kurt Vonnegut’s sketched line drawing of Cin - derella’s fortune over the course of her story [ 142 ] . In this work , we propose that visual sketching interactions can facilitate granular sequence control and sensemaking in iterative story generation . Sequential properties of stories have frequently been visually expressed for intuitive understanding or planning [ 59 , 71 , 79 , 92 , 118 , 121 , 137 , 138 , 142 ] . For example , Kurt Vonnegut [ 142 ] drew out how a character’s fortune changes in a simple time - series line drawing ( Figure 2 ) . This line drawing approach has inspired writers to adopt visual arcs to plan out their stories [ 34 , 100 , 122 ] . With this visualization as inspiration we created TaleBrush ( Fig - ure 1 ) . TaleBrush is focused on human and AI co - writing short story outlines by allowing writers to control the generation according to the level of fortune the protagonist experiences [ 34 , 121 , 142 ] . Writers can specify the sequence of a character’s fortune with a simple and expressive interaction ( Figure 1A3 ) . Using a single stroke ( simple ) , the writer defines the fortune over the entire protagonist’s ‘time - series’ ( expressive ) . The sentences generated by TaleBrush are reflected back to the user as a line drawn on top of the original sketch ( Figure 1B2 ) . The lightweight and intentionally ambiguous nature of sketching [ 49 , 84 ] manages the writer’s expectation re - garding the fidelity of control , making uncertainties and errors in controllability acceptable . To realize this interaction , we im - plemented a technical architecture that achieves steerable story generation by training 1 ) learnable prompts that guide a language model to serve different story generation tasks [ 87 ] and 2 ) a control module that steers the language model to generate stories according to the given sketch [ 83 ] . We conducted a technical evaluation of TaleBrush and found that our approach can reliably steer generations that are still novel and tolerably coherent in flow and grammar . From a user study on 14 participants with varying expertise in story writing , we found that participants could use the sketching control to iteratively steer the generation to find inspiring stories that align with their intentions about the protagonist’s fortune . Some participants also used line sketches as a plan when editing the generated texts . In our discus - sion section , we lay out the design elements for interactions that facilitate iterative human - AI co - creation . We also reflect on how visual sketching interactions can be extended to other story - writing attributes and domains while supporting reliable steerability even under the uncertainty of machine learning algorithms . This work TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA opens up a way of using visual controls and visualizations to make iterative human - AI co - creation intuitive and frictionless . To summarize , our work contributes : 1 ) A line sketching inter - action for control and sensemaking of story generation with an abstract graphical representation of sequential attributes . 2 ) A GPT - based controllable language model architecture that generates story sentences with the sketching input on the protagonist’s fortune . 3 ) TaleBrush , a system that enables human - AI story co - creation with the protagonist’s fortune arc by combining line sketching interac - tion with GPT - based controllable language model . 4 ) Reflections on generalizable design elements of control interaction for iterative human - AI co - creation and how line sketching interaction can be expanded to other generative contexts . 2 RELATED WORK We review research on four main areas related to TaleBrush : 1 ) writing support tools , 2 ) story generation , 3 ) visual expressions of stories , and 4 ) sketching . 2 . 1 Writing Support Tools Many tools support different aspects of writing . These range from spelling and grammar correction [ 85 , 115 ] , to thesauruses [ 45 ] , to crowd - powered editors [ 11 , 108 ] . As writing tasks and styles are often domain - specific , tools can be similarly specialized : email message phrasing [ 23 ] , help requests in professional contexts [ 69 ] , mental support [ 114 ] , affectionate messaging [ 80 ] , education [ 22 ] , and journalism [ 95 ] . Of specific interest to us are tools for creative writing tasks . These run the gamut from suggesting metaphors [ 46 ] to helping with song lyrics [ 147 ] . Commercial tools such as Dramat - ica or Plottr are largely human - driven and help the author structure their plot or narrative [ 19 , 43 ] . To produce content , some tools connect the author to other hu - mans or support collective story writing by writing stories with the crowd . These systems can structure creative leadership [ 77 ] and decision - making [ 78 ] , or even simulate the characters with crowds [ 63 ] . Newer tools have adopted novel machine learning ( ML ) and natural language processing ( NLP ) techniques [ 153 ] . Among those techniques , ML’s generative functions offer a powerful alter - native approach . These systems append or suggest generated texts to the writer’s text using sophisticated language models [ 24 , 28 , 29 , 129 , 143 ] . In theory , these algorithms can act as writing support tools . However , limited controls and interactions—largely rephras - ing prompts and contexts—constrain their applicability . Our goal with TaleBrush is to leverage these language models but provide an alternative control strategy using both text and abstract visual representations and interactions . 2 . 2 Machine Story Generation Story generation is one of the grand challenges in artificial intelli - gence ( AI ) with multiple practical applications . These range from entertainment [ 124 ] and education [ 98 , 124 ] to our target , writing support [ 24 , 28 ] . Early approaches included the use of story block templates that could be put together sequentially [ 30 ] . With compu - tational techniques , autonomous story generation became feasible . One technique is computational planning , where the computer does symbolic planning to accomplish a given goal [ 86 , 101 , 113 , 125 , 146 ] . Case - based reasoning techniques enable story generation by adapt - ing stored stories to new contexts [ 47 , 117 , 123 , 135 , 139 ] . Alterna - tive strategies involve character - based simulation , where characters and the world are simulated to unfold the story with the given facts and underlying beliefs [ 25 , 94 ] . Advances in ML , largely in language models , have introduced more opportunities in story generation [ 5 , 6 , 53 , 64 , 70 , 89 , 90 , 99 , 136 , 145 ] . Specifically , Transformer - based Language Models ( LMs ) [ 21 , 119 , 140 ] probabilistically sample continuing stories [ 41 ] or infilling sentences [ 5 , 35 , 67 , 70 , 89 , 104 , 111 , 145 ] based on the given story context . While imperfect in generating coherent text , they hold promise for improved story generation . Controllability is a key requirement for all these approaches . However , LM models , in particular , utilize structures that are much harder to inspect and explain . For the algorithms to be useful and usable , new control mechanisms are needed [ 28 ] . The most basic , and perhaps obvious , controls are driven by natural lan - guage prompts [ 36 ] ( e . g . , “Tell me a happy story” ) . To better guide LMs , researchers investigated ways to automatically learn these prompts [ 87 , 88 , 93 , 131 ] . Other language - based approaches for con - trol involve specifying keywords to prime the generated text [ 40 , 70 , 134 , 152 ] . Alternative approaches , like Intent - Guided Authoring ( IGA ) , provide some degree of control over output sentences [ 134 ] . The author can use a number of pre - specified tags ( e . g . , cause or effect ) to describe the desired relationship of output to input . Re - searchers also introduced algorithms that generate stories while considering the character goals or abilities [ 3 , 136 ] . Control codes , such as genre ( e . g . , is the story fantasy or science fiction ? ) , can also provide some guidance . Technically , this approach has been enabled by training models with control codes [ 54 , 75 ] , or manipulating in - termediate representation layers of LMs [ 26 , 31 ] . Researchers have also introduced the approach of first acquiring keywords about the code , and generating the story based on them [ 82 ] . As LMs grow with more parameters , adopting these approaches became more challenging , as most LM parameters need to be tuned . To overcome this , researchers train smaller models that guide the large LMs with control codes [ 83 ] . While many approaches apply the control to the whole story ( e . g . , ‘the entire story should be science fiction’ ) , a few approaches demonstrated how different pa - rameters can be applied to different parts of the story [ 90 , 120 , 154 ] . However , they did not consider the interaction of the user control generation algorithms . Building on this prior work , we extend both the technical and interaction sides of controllable story generation . We designed our story generation model to be controlled with real - valued sequence inputs from line sketching interaction . There has been a relevant thread of work called visual story telling [ 10 , 60 – 62 , 66 , 144 ] , that writes stories about visual scenes ( e . g . , a photo of a dog running becomes “A dog was chasing down a rabbit” ) . In contrast , TaleBrush uses sketches of an abstract attribute of the story ( e . g . , the protagonist’s fortune ) . 2 . 3 Visualizing and Visually Expressing Stories To allow users to specify sequential attributes of the story and capture how texts are generated with controls , TaleBrush adopts abstract visual representations . Visual techniques have been used to show high - level attributes of documents [ 73 ] and stories ( e . g . , [ 17 ] ) . CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chung et al . Digital humanities researchers have used visualizations to under - stand stories – a form of “distant reading” [ 71 ] . Through “distant reading” , diverse story components can be visualized . These range from character interactions [ 12 , 15 , 72 , 110 , 151 ] , event progres - sion [ 59 , 92 , 137 , 138 ] , character emotions and sentiment [ 7 , 12 , 32 , 57 , 107 , 121 , 127 ] . As some stories can be non - linear in their telling , researchers have found ways of representing broader narrative structures [ 79 , 130 ] . Our goal is not simply to represent the story through the visualization but to allow for manipulation through that representation . However , not all visualization formats are naturally amenable to direct manipulation ( beyond the standard interaction techniques [ 155 ] ) . With TaleBrush , we focus on visual encodings that can both express high - level changes in the story’s progression but also be manipulable . Kurt Vonnegut’s story arcs fit these requirements . The arcs were used by Vonnegut to express canonical story types with diagrams that show how a protagonist’s fortune changed in the story [ 142 ] . For example , in Figure 2 , Cinderella’s fortune is expressed with a curve that rises , drastically falls , and then rises again . Writers have since leveraged this type of visual expression to plan out story writing [ 34 , 100 , 122 ] . TaleBrush leverages this approach to allow for drawing a property , such as fortune , over time as a way of guiding the generative process . 2 . 4 Sketching Interactions To visually express sequential attributes of stories , TaleBrush uses sketching interaction . Sketching is a flexible and lightweight way to convey the user’s high - level intentions [ 38 ] with its roughness , uncertainty , and ambiguity [ 16 , 49 , 84 ] . Because of these features , various sketching tools have been built to embody these charac - teristics [ 49 ] or act as mechanisms to transform rough ideas into precise representations ( e . g . , visual renderings [ 84 ] ) . This interac - tion style has some similarity to TaleBrush , but without the direct mapping between objects ( e . g . , draw a cat to get a photorealistic cat ) . In the case of TaleBrush , we are creating a sketch in the abstract time - series space that will generate a corresponding story in the ‘concrete’ text space . While sketching is most often used in a ‘direct’ way ( e . g . , drawing a sketch ) , it also has been used for constructing examples ( e . g . , for image [ 39 , 65 ] or 3D model search [ 81 , 112 ] ) . More relevant to our approach are tools for sketching time - series ‘queries’ for finding relevant items in time - series datasets . These can be used to find everything from fixed patterns [ 74 ] to constrained inputs [ 58 , 126 ] to free sketches [ 37 , 42 , 96 , 132 , 148 , 157 ] . However , most systems here assume the existence of matching datasets . In our case , the dataset does not yet exist . Thus , our approach does not sit cleanly in the regular taxonomy of visualization interaction [ 55 , 155 ] . With TaleBrush , we leverage recent work on interactive visualization tools for data generation . However , these are largely focused on numerical approaches rather than text ( e . g . , generating a dataset that matches a sketched histogram [ 97 ] ) . 3 SKETCHING SEQUENCE CONTROL Though narratives may not be linear , stories are inherently formed in a sequence , progressing from the story beginning to the ending . Within that sequence , attributes of the story or characters ( e . g . , the Figure 3 : More than one story attribute can be expressed with a ) multiple control panels or b ) the use of sketching speed . protagonist’s fortune ) can change . Our goal is to allow the user to use these attributes to guide the generated sequence . Specifi - cally , we seek a lightweight mechanism to quickly specify multiple temporally - varying attributes . In this work , we consider line sketch - ing interaction as the modality . There are a number of features of this interaction modality that make the approach appropriate . First , line sketching in time series visualization can be expressive enough to convey sequence and attribute information [ 1 , 106 ] . For exam - ple , in Figure 2 , the sequence can be shown on the 𝑥 - axis while expressing the protagonist’s fortune on the 𝑦 - axis . Second , line sketches are simple . In Figure 2 , the protagonist’s fortune is ex - pressed just in a single stroke of a line . Though we could build a similar time series through sliders , text entry of coordinates into a spreadsheet or clicking on points , a drawn line in a time - series is lightweight and intuitively understood . This design is well suited for continuous values ( e . g . , the fortune level ) . However , one could imagine ‘sketching’ discrete / categorical values as well by drawing disconnected horizontal lines . By default , a simple swipe can allow the author to indicate the attribute , for how long it should last , and where in the story it should exist . While sequence can be expressed in various ways , we choose to use the familiar linear 𝑥 position ( with attribute values on the 𝑦 ) . Lin - ear positions have been most frequently used to visualize sequence and it can promote accurate perceptual judgment of time [ 1 , 18 ] . Rotated ( e . g . , clock ) or spiral - format temporal representations are also possible [ 149 ] but are best suited for representing cycles or seasonality in temporal data—something uncommon in stories . In some cases , we may want to express multiple story at - tributes . For example , the user might want to specify two charac - ters’ fortunes . In this situation , the multiple time series can either be sketched within the same 𝑥 − 𝑦 space ( assuming the scales are the same ) or drawn in multiple spaces ( e . g . , Figure 3a ) . To draw two attributes ( along with time ) in a single plot is possible but requires additional encodings . For example , a connected scatterplot ( see [ 52 ] ) draws the values for the two attributes on the 𝑥 and 𝑦 axes respectively with time encoded using marks on the lines them - selves ( e . g . , arrows or graduated thickness ) that indicates sequence . One could also imagine using a feature of the sketching interaction ( e . g . , pressure or the time it takes to draw a segment ) to encode values . For example , in Figure 3b , time is displayed on the 𝑥 - axis , the value for attribute 𝐴 on the 𝑦 - axis and the time used to draw the stroke ( or pressure ) to encode the 𝐵 attribute ( visually these can be encoded using stroke size or color ) . Drawing speed is naturally combined with stroked lines and allows for a semantic connection TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA between fast - slow drawing speeds , and high - low attribute values . Additionally , users may have ambiguous perceptions of speed and time [ 116 ] . This might further the idea that the generated story will only roughly follow the input . Ultimately , this encoding is likely inappropriate . It still limits us to two attributes and is likely com - plex and discordant as two similar variables ( i . e . , attributes 𝐴 and 𝐵 ) are created and visualized in two different ways . A potentially better use of the drawing speed ( or pen pressure ) is to convey ambiguity and error - tolerance . In most cases , a generative algorithm will not be able to generate a sentence that precisely matches the attribute value . This is due to two factors . First , is the randomness in the generation ( i . e . , we may not be able to generate a sentence with a character’s fortune at exactly 0 . 58 ) . Second , is the inherent noise in any classifier that judges attribute values based on the text . By using ‘sketchiness , ’ we are already conveying some level of ambiguity . However , it would be ideal to allow the end - user to be able to indicate how accurately they want the generated sentence to map to their sketch . To allow this specification , sketch speed or pen pressure may useful . Both actions have a natural mapping to ‘dropping more ink’ in natural pen interactions . The size of the sketched line at a particular time indicates the desired bounds – smaller , indicating more constrained . Notably , the specific semantics of slower motion can be switched . Drawing slower can be made to produce ‘more ink’ and therefore higher tolerance . Conversely , people often draw more slowly when they want an ‘accurate’ shape . Thus , a slower draw speed can semantically map to a more ‘accurate’ ( i . e . , tighter / thinner ) line being drawn . Though there is a fairly broad design space for sketched input , the combination of interactive controls , representation effectiveness , and flexibility seem best addressed through simpler representations : standard time - series for a single attribute and additional panels for multiple attributes . However , stroke speed or pressure , represented as line thickness or color , allows us to encode additional information such as error - tolerance . 4 TALEBRUSH : INTERFACE In this section , we motivate our selection of controlled story at - tributes and explain interactions in TaleBrush’s interface . 4 . 1 Iterative Co - creation With Line Sketching TaleBrush is designed to help writers co - create a short storyline with AI through sketching interactions . TaleBrush supports the planning stage of the writing process [ 44 , 48 ] by giving ideas that can be novel to writers . We chose to support this specific stage , as writers would likely accept and benefit from diverging generations . After a story is generated , writers can freely edit it or even try the generation again to see another story from TaleBrush . TaleBrush can support writers who would use generated sentences as writing prompts , or even potentially help them overcome writer’s block . For novice writers , TaleBrush would demonstrate a story writing that would allow them to easily jump into writing . In TaleBrush , writers iterate on the story generation to reach the desired state . Through our interactive controls , our goal is to allow writers to reach this state with a small number of iterations . As introduced in Section 3 , sketching controls ( green shaded area in Figure 1A3 and B2 ) allow for simple and expressive control inter - action . TaleBrush visualizes generated stories in the same abstract visualization ( blue line in Figure 1B2 ) . Through this , writers can more easily understand the relation of their input to the gener - ated content . We believe that the intuitiveness of these natural controls and visualizations will ultimately allow writers to more easily iterate on the story generation . In our initial implementation , TaleBrush specifically focuses on two controllable attributes . The first is the level of the protag - onist’s fortune . This is based on the existing practice of writers expressing and planning stories based on character or emotional arcs [ 34 , 150 ] or more generally on a character’s fortune [ 142 ] . Tale - Brush is designed to allow the control of the protagonist’s fortune in chronological order . Non - linear narratives , such as flashbacks , are not currently supported . The user can also specify how tightly TaleBrush would follow these given fortune parameters at the cost of generation time . The second attribute is the level of surprise in the generation , or how unexpected the generation should be . 4 . 2 Interface 4 . 2 . 1 Text Editor and Canvas . TaleBrush has a text editor ( Fig - ure 1A2 and B1 ) and a canvas for drawing and visualizing the story arc ( Figure 1A3 and B2 ) . The text editor has multiple ‘bullet points’ , each of which stands for a single sequence step , most often a sen - tence . The writer can add their own sequence sentences or ask TaleBrush to generate them . As with a standard editor , the writer can add new sequence sentences ( simply by hitting enter ) , or re - move them by deleting the bullet point line . TaleBrush will visualize each bullet point line as a dot in the canvas and sequential dots will be graphically connected with lines . Thus , there is a correspon - dence between bullet point order and 𝑥 position of those sentences in the visualization . Missing sentences ( i . e . , blank bullet points ) are reflected with a visual gap . The protagonist’s fortune in a given sentence is determined by an ML recognition algorithm . 4 . 2 . 2 Generate By Sketching . After the writer sketches a charac - ter’s fortune ( as described in Section 3 ) , TaleBrush generates text for those sentences for “sketched” sentence slots . For example , the writer can enter one or two sentences , for which the fortune is calculated and displayed . They can then sketch the rest of the se - quence . TaleBrush also supports ‘infilling’ the story . For example , if the writer enters a sentence at the start and end of the sentence list , this will appear as a broken line in the visualization . The writer can sketch how they want the story to behave in this empty part and TaleBrush will create suitable sentences . The writer can also draw ‘broken’ lines by erasing part of the sketched line . In this mode , TaleBrush will generate a suitable sentence but without any specific fortune ‘target . ’ This allows writers to explore stories even when they do not have a specific idea on what the character’s fortune should do . Once the sketch is drawn , the writer can per - form generation again with the same parameters by clicking the “Generate Again” button ( Figure 1B3 ) . They can also redraw a line only on a part of the sequence to see other generated sentences on the redrawn part . In all cases , the writer also can revise generated sentences directly in the text editor . CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chung et al . Figure 4 : TaleBrush allows writers to specify the level of ‘sur - prise’ for each generated sentence . A separate canvas can be opened where the writer can sketch a thin green line indi - cating the desired level of surprise . Here , we see a fortune arc for Mike ( top ) starting high , going low , and ending high . A corresponding surprise sketch ( bottom ) indicates that the author wanted the first part of the story to be more con - trolled but the end should be very surprising . Sketching Speed for Generation Control Tightness . As the con - trolled generation has uncertainty in how the control would apply , with the sketching speed , the writer can set how closely generated sentences should follow the given sketch . With slow sketching , TaleBrush tries more generations to find the sentence that better matches the given fortune parameter . In our experience , we found that the fast → less accurate and slow → more accurate mappings were easier to understand . The drawn sketch can be perceived as an ‘envelope’ representing the bounds in which the generated sen - tences would be more likely to fall ( Figure 1A3 and B2 ) . We detail how the specific width is determined in Section 6 . The width of the sketched line gradually changes visually ( i . e . , it is not disjoint ) . This is more appealing visually . However , the actual envelope is determined using sentence ‘units . ’ Subtle vertical lines indicated where these transitions are , thus allowing the user to vary their drawing speed in each segment . Surprise Level Control . As we describe below , the specific lan - guage model we used also allowed us to change parameters that roughly translated to how ‘surprising’ a sentence would be in the following prior sentences . For example , with the beginning sen - tence of “Melissa fought a dragon” , the low surprise may generate “The dragon was a big , green , scaly beast” , but the high surprise may result in “Melissa killed a giant robot with a robot dragon” . To experiment with this feature , we added a “surprise in a separate panel” control . This would open up another time series canvas Figure 5 : TaleBrush stores generated stories in a list ( A ) and allows writers to compare them on the canvas by visualizing the fortune arcs of all stored stories in low opacity ( B ) . The writer can hover over stored stories in the list to see their text and story arc visualization . where the writer could draw the desired level of surprise for each sentence segment ( see Figure 4 ) . 4 . 2 . 3 Multi - Story Management . As the writer generates multi - ple stories , TaleBrush stores each . Users can compare and choose among them ( Figure 5 ) . A dropdown menu lists the generated sto - ries , which will be displayed on the canvas with low opacity . As the writer moves the mouse over the list , the hovered story is shown in the text box and highlighted on the canvas . The writer can select one of these to ‘roll back’ to a past generation . 4 . 3 Implementation The interface for TaleBrush is implemented as a web application , using HTML , CSS , JavaScript , and React . The language model oper - ations for text generation are implemented in a back - end server . A Flask - based REST API is used to connect the front – and back – end sub - systems . 5 TALEBRUSH : TECHNICAL DETAILS There are two principle technical components to TaleBrush : sen - tence recognition , which determines a fortune level given an input sentence ; and sentence generation , which creates new sentences . We begin by explaining our annotated training data , and then cover each of recognition and generation modules . 5 . 1 Collecting Fortune of the Protagonist We adopted crowdsourcing to create an annotated fortune dataset , as there is no readily available data of this type . We define the protagonist’s fortune as level of ‘goodness’ or ‘badness’ of the fortune experienced by the protagonist , as perceived by the readers . This con - struct is naturally affected by the character’s status , emotional and physical well - being , or spatial , mental , and emotional proximity to the character’s goal [ 34 ] . While line sketching interaction would require fortune annotations to be real values , due to the subjectivity in perceiving this concept , directly collecting real - valued annota - tions can result in a high variance . As people can make comparisons reliably on subjective annotations [ 33 , 68 ] , we took the approach similar to previous work’s [ 33 ] : turning crowdsourced comparisons into real - valued annotations . TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Figure 6 : Interface for annotating the protagonist’s fortune level . The annotator can make comparisons between sen - tences in the given story . Calibration sentences help for making comparisons between stories . We collected fortune annotations on a subset of the ROCStories dataset [ 105 ] . Items in this dataset are short five - sentence stories . We randomly sampled 2200 stories , using 2000 for training and 200 as a test set . We assigned three annotators for each story . During data collection , we explicitly specified the protagonist of the story . Annotators were asked to specify the level of the protagonist’s for - tune for each sentence using a continuous slider ( Figure 6 ) . While this annotation approach is mainly designed to collect real - valued annotations , the interface also enables annotators to encode com - parisons between sentences . Workers were not explicitly asked to compare sentences between different stories . However , they were asked to annotate using the “calibrating sentences” as benchmarks . One of the authors crafted these calibrating sentences from a three - sentence story to ensure a unique , single - sentence example for three fortune ‘types’ : good , bad , and neutral . Our annotators were asked to label these calibrating sentences at the start of the task and could see them as they worked ( see Figure 6 ) . To ensure high annotation quality , we included one gold stan - dard question with sentences of obvious good and bad fortunes . We filtered out workers who annotated such questions in opposite for - tune directions . We recruited annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk , who are in the US and had 97 % acceptance rate with 1000 or more accepted tasks . Each worker was asked to annotate 11 stories including the calibrating story and was paid $ 2 . 50 ( about $ 10 / hr payment rate ) . To learn the reliability of annotations , we analyzed agreements between pairs of annotators . We measured Spearman’s 𝜌 in rank - ing five sentences in a story according to the fortune level ( i . e . , with perfect agreement 𝜌 = 1 or − 1 with perfect disagreement ) . The average and median of 𝜌 values between pairs were 0 . 54 and 0 . 7 , respectively . Though clearly imperfect , annotators did display agreement in their annotations . Toturncomparisonsintoreal - valuedlabels , weusedtheTrueSkill algorithm [ 33 , 56 , 102 ] . The algorithm can calculate the real - valued fortune score of each sentence out of all comparisons from our crowdsourced annotations . While this algorithm is originally de - signed to infer rankings of game players out of all individual game results , like who won or lost , we adapted it to get rankings of fortunes out of all comparison annotations . With this algorithm , sentences frequently annotated to have a higher fortune than other sentences would have a high fortune ranking . We normalized this ranking information to have a uniformly distributed dataset on the scale of 0 to 1 and used the resulting annotations . 5 . 2 Technical Architecture A high level architecture for the recognition and generation ele - ments of TaleBrush is depicted in Figure 7 . 5 . 2 . 1 Recognition Module . TaleBrush recognizes the protagonist’s fortune to map sentences in the visualization . To match the training dataset for the recognition and controlled generation , we trained our own recognition model . Specifically , we use prompting ap - proaches of GPT - based models [ 21 , 119 ] . For instance , to recognize the protagonist’s fortune , to the model , we can input the prompt “Es - timate fortune : ” with the subject sentence appended to it . However , hand - designing optimal prompts is known to be challenging [ 87 , 93 ] . Hence , we used the soft prompt approach [ 87 , 88 , 93 ] , which learns these prompts on the continuous input embedding space . These soft prompts replace “discrete” natural language prompts . In other words , we can replace “Estimate fortune : ” with several learnable soft prompt embeddings . We took the soft prompt tuning approach [ 87 ] instead of fine - tuning the whole parameters of the LM , as trained soft prompts require less memory ( about × 10 5 less size than the whole parameters ) . Fine - tuning multiple whole - parameter models for multiple tasks ( e . g . , generation ) , would require significantly more computation resources . We trained the soft prompts to minimize the regression loss on the protagonist’s fortune label of an estimated sentence . As a language model , we used a GPT - Neo [ 13 ] , which is a GPT - based auto - regressive model [ 21 , 119 ] with 2 . 7 billion parameters . We included the context sentences previous to the target sentence in the input data , as they can have critical information . This previous context includes , at maximum , three sentences . We picked three as it had the smallest loss in the test dataset . We also included the protagonist’s name in the context . The input and output labels are formatted as follows : • Input : [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , ( previous context ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , ( protagonist ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑡𝑎𝑟 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑟 ] , ( target sentence ) • Label : 𝑦 ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] [ 𝑃 𝑖𝑟 ] stands for the placeholder for soft prompt embeddings , with 𝑟 and 𝑖 indicating the role and the index of soft prompts , respectively . For each prompt role , we chose three prompt tokens ( 𝑛 = 3 ) which fit with that of initialization prompts we used ( ‘Previous Context : ’ for 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 , ‘Protagonist : ’ for 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 , and ‘Sentence : ’ for 𝑃 𝑡𝑎𝑟 ) . With trained prompts , we could recognize the protagonist’s fortune , as demonstrated on Cinderella in Figure 8 . 5 . 2 . 2 Generation Module . Our goal is for TaleBrush’s generation to be steerable with a sequence of fortune values . For this , we modified CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chung et al . Figure 7 : The technical architecture of TaleBrush . To serve recognition and generation , the prompts of a Base - LM are tuned . These prompts are used interchangeably for a single LM . For fortune recognition , context , prompt embeddings , and target sentence are given as inputs and the fortune level is predicted as a real value between 0 and 1 . For controlled generation with the fortune sketch , a modified version of GeDi is used . GeDi is a fine - tuned model that steers the generation according to real - valued fortune input , or continuous control code . Context and prompt embeddings are also used as input . For a sentence to be generated , the 𝑦 - position of a point in a sketch is used as a continuous control code . This continuous control code has a value between 0 and 1 and its input embedding is interpolated with three class codes ( bad for 0 , neutral for 0 . 5 , and good for 1 ) before being input into the modified GeDi . Base - LM used GPT - Neo while the modified GeDi used GPT2 - medium . Figure 8 : How the protagonist’s fortune is recognized in the summary of Cinderella . The visualized recognition results are similar to Vonnegut’s original ( Figure 2 ) . the approach used in GeDi [ 83 ] , which uses a fine - tuned smaller model to guide a bigger language model with a control input . In order to explain the details of our GeDi variant , we first describe how generation can be done with LMs . Then , we describe our base LM that serves story generation tasks and GeDi model that steers stories with the control code . Generation with Language Model . When an auto - regressive LM receives a sequence of tokens ( 𝑥 1 : 𝑇 = { 𝑥 1 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑇 } ) , it calculates the probabilities for the next tokens with a chain rule ( 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑥 1 : 𝑇 ) = (cid:206) 𝑇𝑡 = 1 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑥 𝑡 | 𝑥 < 𝑡 ) ) . With this probability , we can sample out the next likely token . By inputting the sampled token back into the LM , we can also calculate the probability for the token that comes after the lastly sampled token . Base Language Model for Story Generation . As a base LM for language generation , TaleBrush uses the same GPT - Neo the recog - nition module uses . However , different soft prompt embeddings are trained for the generation tasks . The benefit is that one large pre - trained LM can be utilized for different tasks just by replacing prompts and contexts according to the task purpose . We trained soft prompts for story continuation and infilling . For continuation ( Figure 9a ) , the previous context and protagonist are fed into the language model as input and the model generates the continuing sentences . We appended the character information as models with - out character information tend to introduce random characters . We placed the character information right before the text to be gener - ated , to make it more likely that character information is considered during the continuing generation . Accordingly , the input data is formulated as the following : • Continuation : [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , ( previous context ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , ( protagonist ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡 ] Similar to recognition prompts , we chose the number of prompts that matches the initializing prompt ( 𝑛 = 3 with ‘Beginning Story : ’ for 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 , ‘Story Character : ’ for 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 , and ‘Continue Story : ’for 𝑃 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡 ) . For infilling ( Figure 9b and c ) , we included both the previous and next contexts and the protagonist as the model input . We trained two types of prompts for infilling : one for filling after the previous context , and the other for filling backward from the next context . When running infilling generation , these two prompts are used in turn , switching from one to the other for every generated infilling sentence . For infilling from the previous , we placed the previous TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Figure 9 : TaleBrush performs three story generation tasks : a ) continuation , b ) infill from previous , and c ) infill from next . For different generation tasks , how contexts and prompts are structured for inputs differs . In Input to GPT - Neo , dark boxes indicate continuous prompts . In Generated , red text stand for generated sentences . context right before the text to be generated , as the generated text will be appended right next to the previous context . With a similar rationale , for infilling from next , we placed the next context right before the text to be generated . We placed protagonist information at the front - most prompt , as infilling tend to digress less with the protagonist compared to continuation . This likely occurs as the protagonist is mentioned in both the ‘previous’ and ‘next’ contexts . The input data for infilling was formulated as follows : • Infilling from the previous : [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , ( protagonist ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 ] , ( next context ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , ( previous context ) [ 𝑃 1 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙 ] • Infilling from the next : [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 ] , ( protagonist ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 ] , ( previous context ) , [ 𝑃 1 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 ] , ( next context ) [ 𝑃 1 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙 ] , . . . , [ 𝑃 𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙 ] We chose the number of prompts according to that of the initial - izing prompt . ( 𝑛 = 3 with ‘Story Character : ’ for 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡 , ‘Beginning Story : ’ for 𝑃 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 , and ‘Ending Story : ’ for 𝑃 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 , and 𝑛 = 4 with ‘Infilled Story : ’ for 𝑃 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑙 ) . Controlling Generation with GeDi . TaleBrush adopts the GeDi approach . This model guides an LM model ( base LM ) with a smaller Class - conditional LM ( CC - LM ) that is fine - tuned to generate using a user - specified control code ( e . g . , generate a happy story with the control code of “good” ) . Similar to standard LMs , CC - LM calculates the probability of the next token given a sequence of tokens . How - ever , it also considers a specific control code ( 𝑐 ) given to the CC - LM ( 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑥 1 : 𝑇 | 𝑐 ) = (cid:206) 𝑇𝑡 = 1 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑥 𝑡 | 𝑥 < 𝑡 , 𝑐 ) ) . With CC - LM’s probabilities for different codes and the Bayes rule , we also can calculate the prob - ability of each sequence of tokens being classified into a control code : 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑐 | 𝑥 1 : 𝑡 ) = 𝑃 ( 𝑐 ) 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑥 1 : 𝑡 | 𝑐 ) 𝛼 / 𝑡 Σ 𝑐 ′ ∈ { 𝑐 , ¯ 𝑐 } 𝑃 ( 𝑐 ′ ) 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑥 1 : 𝑡 | 𝑐 ′ ) 𝛼 / 𝑡 , ( 1 ) where 𝛼 is a learnable scale parameter and ¯ 𝑐 is codes other than the selected one . This probability can be combined with that of base LMs , to decide which token would lead to the coherent story that follows the control code : 𝑃 𝜔 ( 𝑥 𝑡 | 𝑥 < 𝑡 , 𝑐 ) ∝ 𝑃 𝐿𝑀 ( 𝑥 𝑡 | 𝑥 < 𝑡 ) 𝑃 𝜃 ( 𝑐 | 𝑥 𝑡 , 𝑥 < 𝑡 ) 𝜔 ( 2 ) Note that 𝜔 serves as a parameter that decides how much steering will be done with GeDi ( higher → more steering ) . GeDi is faster than other control approaches that directly manipulate weights [ 31 ] Figure 10 : An approach to turn continuous control codes into embeddings that can be input to CC - LM . For three ex - treme classes ( 1 , 0 . 5 , 0 ) , we use embeddings of the tokens , good , neutral , and bad , respectively . For other control codes , we interpolated the embeddings of these extreme classes . or that filter from many generated texts . Thus it is better suited for interactive applications . Modified GeDi for Continuous - Value Control . We modified GeDi to control generation with continuous - valued control codes . To enable continuous control between good and bad fortunes , we in - terpolated between extreme fortune classes . We first trained CC - LM with three topic classes , each mapping to extremely bad fortune , neutral fortune , and extremely good fortune . When training the CC - LM with these three classes , we took the multi - class topic control approach introduced in GeDi [ 83 ] . With this approach , the given “main” codes are true and false , while three classes of bad , neutral , and good are given as the secondary codes . When given true , CC - LM trains to generate texts according to the given secondary code , and with false , CC - LM would not follow the secondary code . We adopted this multi - class topic control approach as it has benefit in computation time , with fewer “main” control codes to be computed to get the probability from Equation 1 . We also included the pro - tagonist’s name at the beginning of the input as contexts . A part of training dataset might look like : • < true > < good > Protagonist : Mark # Mark was happy to pass the exam that he wanted to pass . • < false > < bad > Protagonist : Mark # Mark was happy to pass the exam that he wanted to pass . For the training data , we used only some of the annotations from our collection : those in the top , middle , and bottom 10 % percentile . That is , we mapped ranges of values to three discrete classes to CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chung et al . assure we have enough training data . To train this CC - LM , we fine - tuned the GPT2 - medium model . After the CC - LM is trained , when an arbitrary value between 0 and 1 is used as a code , we interpolate embeddings between three discrete classes considering each of them as having 0 , 0 . 5 , and 1 ( Figure 10 ) . Then , we used the interpolated embedding as the input embedding . For example , when the control code is 0 . 25 ( halfway between the bad and neutral fortunes ) , we calcualted the weighted sum of the the learned bad and neutral embeddings with the weight of 0 . 5 each . While GeDi steers the generation with the protagonist’s fortune , it can potentially make errors , producing sentences outside of the desired fortune level . To handle these errors , we adopted the ap - proach of regenerating sentences if they were significantly out of the range of the specified code . Specifically , TaleBrush’s recognition module measures the generated sentence’s level of fortune , and if it disagrees with the control value , TaleBrush tries to generate again . We set the threshold of error for regeneration as 0 . 2 ( i . e . , | 𝑦 − ˆ 𝑦 | > 0 . 2 ) . TaleBrush tries to regenerate the text 1 - 2 more times . Again , this is based on the desired ‘closeness’ of the generated for - tune to the writer’s intent ( as expressed by the speed of the writer’s drawn stroke ) . After the maximum number of regeneration has been tried , TaleBrush picks the generated sentence that has minimal fortune level error with the given control value . The surprise level control value is used as the temperature of the softmax function of the base language model . To implement our architecture , we used models from Huggingface 12 . 6 TECHNICAL EVALUATION We conducted technical evaluations on the recognition and gen - eration modules . For recognition , we measured how accurately a character’s fortune is recognized in a sentence . For the generation module , we focused on how controllability impacts other qualities of the story . Controllability is known to have trade - offs with some story qualities like coherence [ 90 ] . Ideally , our control approach would allow the writer to steer the generation without hurting other metrics . We conducted three evaluations : 1 ) recognition per - formance , 2 ) an automated evaluation on generation , to find the parameter that can achieve the ‘sweet spot’ between controllability and coherence , and 3 ) human evaluation on generation , to show that our approach allows controllability while maintaining other story qualities . 6 . 1 Fortune Recognition Evaluation To evaluate the recognition module , we focused on recognition error , the difference between the recognized fortune value and the gold standard labels . This was done on the 200 annotated examples reserved for testing . The mean and median errors were 0 . 179 and 0 . 159 respectively on a 0 to 1 scale . We considered this result to be reliable . Concepts similar to fortune , such as sentiment , are usually measured through an ordinal five - level scale . Human raters can easily discern concepts with this number of levels [ 133 ] . If we view the five levels on a 0 to 1 scale , with the assumption of the uniform interval between levels ( which is widely adopted in 1 https : / / huggingface . co / 2 Code for TaleBrush is shared in https : / / johnr0 . github . io / publications / TaleBrush _ CHI2022 . ML [ 133 , 156 ] ) , then the gap between levels will be 0 . 25 . Our average error ( . 179 ) is below this 0 . 25 gap so most differences would not be easily discernible . 6 . 2 Automated Generation Evaluation We conducted the automated evaluation to identify the parameter that balances coherence and controllability . Here , the parameter of interest is 𝜔 : how intensely the steering control is applied . Past work has demonstrated that a higher 𝜔 value leads to better controllabil - ity , but worse coherence [ 90 ] . As we modified the GeDi approach to our context , we reinvestigated how 𝜔 impacts coherence and controllability . For coherence , we calculated perplexity , which is a measure of how well a probability model predicts to generate a sequence of text tokens [ 20 ] . To evaluate the controllability , we measured the control difference : the difference between an input fortune value and the estimated fortune level of the text generated . To estimate the fortune level of generated text , we used our fortune recognition module . We measured these two metrics with our 200 test data points . For the continuation task , we considered the first sentence as the initial context and generated four more sentences . For infilling , we considered the first and the last sentences as the initial context and generated middle three more sentences . For the controlled generation , we gave fortune annotations in our test data as control values and measured perplexity and control difference , while varying 𝜔 value . Recall that we allow for ‘regenerating’ the text up to two times to improve the generated text’s fit to the desired fortune ( selecting the best of the generated options ) . We also simulated this regeneration up to two times to determine the impact of this on our metrics . With controlled continuation ( Figure 11a ) , the perplexity tends to increase with the increase of 𝜔 . The increases in median and 25 𝑡ℎ percentile were relatively stable compared to that of 75 𝑡ℎ percentile . The control difference tended to decrease very slightly with the increase of 𝜔 . The regeneration approach tends to decrease not only the median of control differences but also the 75 𝑡ℎ percentile of control difference by a large amount . Regenerating once ( two stories to pick from ) resulted in a 30 % - 40 % increase in generation time , while regenerating twice ( three stories ) resulted in a 50 % - 60 % increase . The rate of performing regeneration decreased very slightly with the increase of 𝜔 . With infilling , the change of 𝜔 did not change perplexity much ( Figure 11b ) . This might be because infilling considers both be - ginning and end contexts , and would diverge less from the gold standard sentences . On the other hand , for continuation , as there is no end context to consider , the generated text can diverge sig - nificantly from the gold standard sentences . The control difference and regeneration rate did not have a discernible trend with changes to 𝜔 . Without regeneration , the control difference of infilling was larger than that of continuation . Similar to continuation generation , the addition of regeneration leads to decreased control difference . The rate of regeneration was 40 % - 50 % when regenerated once and 50 % - 65 % when regenerated twice , which was higher than those of the continuation . From the results , we find that a small 𝜔 value did not hurt con - trollability much . Moreover , a low 𝜔 value assured low perplexity TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA 0 1 5 10 3050 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 p e r p l e x i t y 1 5 10 3050 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 c o n t r o l d i ff e r e n c e a ) Continuation 1 5 10 3050 0 20 40 60 r e g e n e r a t i o n r a t e ( % ) 0 1 5 10 3050 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 p e r p l e x i t y 1 5 10 3050 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 c o n t r o l d i ff e r e n c e b ) Infilling 1 5 10 3050 0 20 40 60 r e g e n e r a t i o n r a t e ( % ) without regen with 1 regen with 2 regen Figure 11 : Automated evaluation results on controlled story a ) continuation and b ) infilling . Median of perplexity and control difference ( between given control value and output fortune ) are plotted for the range between 25 𝑡ℎ and 75 𝑡ℎ percentile . In the regeneration condition , we measured the rate of sentences that were regenerated to minimize control difference . The 𝑥 - axis is presented in log - scale . in continuation tasks . If regenerating once , the control difference decrease at a cost of 30 % - 50 % more generation time . Considering the findings , in TaleBrush , we use 𝜔 value of 1 and try regeneration once as a baseline . Recall that we still limit regeneration to at most twice based on the writer’s input . While additional regeneration may improve the results , the response time costs may be too high for an interactive application with the current architecture . 6 . 3 Human Evaluation on Generation In addition to the automated test , we conducted a human eval - uation to see if stories generated by TaleBrush are perceived as coherent , novel , and controlled . For controllability , we showed eval - uators two sentences generated with two different fortune levels and asked them to decide in which sentence the protagonist has a better fortune . Evaluators were not shown the input fortune values . If an evaluator chose the sentence generated with a higher fortune control value , we considered the answer correct . All fortune val - ues in the human evaluation were randomly sampled . However , in the controllability study , we excluded control values that were too similar ( a difference smaller than 0 . 25 ) , as such similar controls would be even difficult for humans to differentiate . We decided this threshold as 0 . 25 as fortune level differences larger than this value would be discernible to evaluators ( i . e . , five - level Likert scales are frequently used for sentiment annotation ) . We additionally investi - gated the novelty of generated texts as TaleBrush is designed to aid story ideation . We showed evaluators two versions of generated stories : one ‘with’ controls ( i . e . , using the GeDi model and char - acter fortune values ) ; and the other without controls ( only with the prompt - tuned GPT - Neo model ) . We asked the evaluators to decide which story was more coherent or novel . For coherence , we specifically asked : 1 ) if story flow is coherent ( story coherence ) and 2 ) if sentences are grammatically coherent ( grammaticality ) . While there can be more specific incoherent patterns [ 50 ] , we chose story coherence and grammaticality as they each can tell us about the global and local coherence of the story . Evaluators could choose one of the generated stories with better coherence or novelty ( CX for “without controls” and CO for “with controls” in Figure 12 ) , or decide that they are similar in quality ( S in Figure 12 ) . Evaluators were not aware of which story is generated with fortune controls . For each criterion , we evaluated 100 story pairs , 50 for continua - tion and the other 50 for infilling . When generating these stories , we applied the regeneration strategy once and used 𝜔 = 1 . We hired crowd workers as evaluators , as we wanted to know if even non - experts in story writing perceive TaleBrush’s generations as coherent , controlled , and novel . For each assessment question , we assigned three crowd workers to assure reliable evaluation . We recruited crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk , who are in the US , with acceptance rates higher than 97 % and more than 1000 tasks accepted . Each worker evaluated one criterion , for eleven pairs of stories including one gold standard question . We paid them $ 3 , which is over a $ 10 / hr payment rate . Figure 12 summarizes our results . Evaluators recognized which sentence is generated with a higher fortune control value 88 . 0 % of time for continuation ( 84 . 7 % for infilling ) . Stories generated without fortune controls ( CX ) were chosen most frequently to have better story coherence and grammaticality . In continuation , their ratio was below 50 % ( 45 . 3 % and 46 . 0 % for story coherence and grammati - cality , respectively ) . That is , when using continuation with fortune controls , in more than half of cases , users would observe stories with similar ( S ) or better ( CO ) story coherence and grammaticality compared to those generated without controls . With infilling algo - rithms , similar to continuation , stories generated without controls ( CX ) showed better story coherence and grammaticality most fre - quently , but their frequencies were higher than continuation ( 62 . 7 % and 76 . 7 % for story coherence and grammaticality , respectively ) . One potential reason for this result might be the fundamental diffi - culty in generating coherent infilling stories when a given fortune sequence is not plausible ( e . g . , drastic fluctuation in fortune ) . For novelty , with continuation algorithm , different conditions showed similar performances . With the infilling algorithm , stories gen - erated with controls ( CO ) are perceived to be more novel more frequently . In summary , we found that novelty is not hurt with fortune controls . We also find that our control approach can steer the generation according to the control value , but at some cost to story coherence and grammaticality . The cost is lower in the continuation algorithm than in infilling one . Regardless of the strat - egy , no generative algorithm can generate perfect coherence or grammaticality . Thus , it is critical to ensure that the writer can edit the final text . 7 USER STUDY We conducted a user study to gain insights and feedback on the potential , limitations , and future opportunities of sketching inter - actions for iterative human - AI story co - creation .

As this study seeks to understand how users leveraged our novel interactions , we did not conduct a formal comparison to existing human - AI story co - creation tools . 7 . 1 Participants We recruited 14 participants ( 7 female and 7 male ) by word - of - mouth and through online advertisements on social media and communities of universities . Participants completed a pre - survey on their background before the study . Our participants had a range of expertise : novices , hobbyists , and experts . We classified partici - pants who do not write stories occasionally as novices . Others were classified as either hobbyists or experts , and experts considered themselves as story - writing professionals . Participants were fluent in using English . We detailed participants in Table 1 . 7 . 2 Procedure We conducted a remote study with Zoom 3 . Participants were first given an overview of the study ( 15 min ) , then went through a tutorial on the tool ( 15 min ) . Participants could access TaleBrush directly through a URL we shared . In the tutorial , we explained that better fortune was represented with higher points on the 𝑦 - axis . However , we allowed participants to use the tool to specifically learn how the mapping worked as there are no explicit axis labels . After the tutorial , we asked participants to use TaleBrush in two tasks . First , they were given a specific story beginning and were asked to generate a continuing story with TaleBrush until they found one that appealed as a draft story . After participants picked this draft story , they were asked to edit the text directly without additional generation ( 20 min ) . This task allowed us to observe how participants drew fortune arcs and which of the generated elements they retained or modified . For the second task , we asked participants to freely use the tool , bringing in their own story from the very beginning ( 20 min ) . We did not restrict how and when they used generation . Whereas the first task roughly corresponded to one ‘turn’ ( machine then human ) , the second allowed us to observe an iterative co - creation process . In both tasks , we asked participants to share the screen of the interface . We also asked participants to think aloud while using TaleBrush to learn their rationales and reactions in using the tool . Lastly , we conducted a short interview , asking the experience of using TaleBrush , such as how they used 3 https : / / zoom . us / the line sketching , how they incorporated stories generated by the tool , and how they would adopt TaleBrush to their practice ( 20 min ) . The whole session was video - recorded . 7 . 3 Results We qualitatively analyzed screen recordings , think - aloud state - ments , and interviews . One of the authors analyzed data by iterative coding with inductive analysis , and coded results were reviewed with two other authors . Note that unless explicitly stated , results are about the participants across all expertise levels . 7 . 3 . 1 Use of Line Sketches . Line sketching facilitates iterative co - creation with intuitive con - trols . Overall , participants indicated that line sketching was a sim - ple and expressive way to specify the protagonist’s fortune . As critically , they understood how to use sketching to steer text gen - eration . Participants also thought that fortune was an effective attribute to control the overall story flow . During the study , writers experimented and iterated on multiple line sketches . Some tried gen - eration on a sub - part of the story to only change that part . Others tried generation in the middle of editing the story . For example , P6 repetitively tried generation to find infilling sentences that would go along well with the ending sentence previously generated from TaleBrush . During the process , P6 also edited generated sentences and used them as the context for the next generation . Participants also mentioned that sketching allowed them to specify the arc with - out the pressure of being precise . For example , P6 mentioned : “If I should have input each number , I might have been more reluctant to complete the story . Because they are specifying more detailed values . So , I think drawing would be more helpful in generating the stories . ” Surprise control and controllability in small changes could be im - proved . A few participants used the surprise control , but the per - ceived effectiveness diverged between participants . Additionally , when participants used sketching for small and detailed fortune changes , they felt that their control was not reflected well on the generation . The feature of specifying control fidelity with sketching speed might have been one approach to solve this problem , but it was not effective enough in some cases . Participants speculated that the feeling of lack of control might be due to disagreement between their perception of fortune and the fortune level calculated by TaleBrush . The current generation approach of replacing the whole sentence may have also exacerbated this problem , as the user expected a slight change in the text when they are making TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Table 1 : Participants of the user study .

While the new sentence may be at the appropriate fortune level , the content may have been too radically different from the sentence at that time point . Line sketching facilitated the planning of writing to some par - ticipants . Within the iterative co - creation process , the line sketch could also influence participants to edit the story to follow the sketched fortune arc . For example , in Figure 13 , P2 edited generated text to follow the line sketch that P2 drew in most sentences ( from b to c ) . Because the current story was constantly compared to the drawn sketch , the participant would try to adjust the story so that it was more aligned with the sketch . Participants also mentioned that the sketch served as a plan or a guideline . For example , P7 mentioned : “As I draw graphs , it is intuitive , I could easily see how I would compose the storyline and how I should structure it . ” However , some participants who deeply focused on the story itself did not consider the sketch when editing the text . 7 . 3 . 2 Use of Generated Texts . Generated texts are used as ideation materials . From the automat - ically generated stories , participants adopted characters , settings , short expressions , sentences , events , or even the overall story flow . For example , in Figure 13a , P2 liked the event described in the third sentence and edited the story to go along with the sentence . Novice participants mentioned that generated texts lowered the barrier on starting writing , as they would have more frustration if they start from a blank paper . Incoherent generations are targets for revision . Unsurprisingly , participants frequently revised incoherent parts . For example , the sixth sentence of Figure 13a was taken off because mentioning flip - flops was perceived as a drastic context change . Participants also added more details to the story to make it more reasonable and concrete . For example , in Figure 13a , P2 added details on the ‘pool’ in the second sentence that it is a new swimming pool on the way to the protagonist’s home . Participants also added new sentences to make the story flow natural . For instance , in Figure 13a , P2 added the last sentence to make the ending more natural . Interestingly , the editing pattern of novices , hobbyists , and experts did not differ much , potentially due to the novelty of the tool’s functionality to participants . Incoherent generations serve as the reason to exert creativity for some participants . While incoherent or ambiguous story elements require participants to revise sentences , some participants appre - ciated this as a ‘prompt’ to apply their own creativity and revise the text . For example , P1 mentioned : “If , there is nothing like that [ incoherence ] , I would not do something creative . However , with some - thing that needs to be fixed , and if you kind of get that they need to be revised , I feel like I can exert my creativity . . . So I don’t think these are downsides . ” Moreover , some ‘incoherence’ was perceived as novel elements to participants . This ‘bug’ thus becomes a ‘feature’ in the context of ideation support . 7 . 3 . 3 Potential of TaleBrush in practice and suggestions for improve - ments . Potential for quick and iterative ideation . Experts and hobbyists mentioned that they would use TaleBrush to quickly iterate through diverse ideas . Collected ideas can be used in the ideation stage or to overcome writer’s block . This benefit would be maximized in settings where the writer should bring up multiple stories , such as tabletop role - playing games . Supporting more attributes , longer texts , and various types of writ - ings . Participants mentioned that they would like to see controls for more story attributes , such as other characters’ fortunes , set - tings , or genres . They reasoned that more controls would likely lead to a more desired text that they would adopt to theirs . Some participants indicated that the visualization and control granular - ity might need to change if TaleBrush expands to generate longer CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Chung et al . texts , as users would want to give paragraph - level or chapter - level specifications . Experts noted that TaleBrush needs to be adapted to each usage context . For example , P11 , a screenwriter , stated that the tool should be able to express character emotions or states only with observational statements , as those need to be shown , not told , in screen writings . Finally , participants mentioned the potential of using sketching to control generation of texts other than stories , such as controlling tone in speech or editorials . Addressing bias . Potential bias in the story generation and con - trol was brought up as an issue . For example , P5 perceived that the algorithm generates stories that are more likely written in west - ern culture . P10 mentioned that the controlled generation did not align with what they expected when the protagonist is an anti - hero , signaling potential bias . An important starting point would be in ensuring a more diverse training set , as is broader testing . 8 DISCUSSION While TaleBrush is currently focused on character fortune , we reflect lessons learned for control design and for iterative human - AI co - creation . 8 . 1 The Gulf of Human - AI Co - Creation Our design for interactive controls addresses challenges in the gulf of execution and evaluation [ 109 ] between the user and the generative AI systems . A key feature is reducing the friction in the iterative co - creation process . First , the control interaction of TaleBrush is designed to be expressive and easy . These are often conflicting goals : simple interfaces have limited expressiveness and expressive interfaces are not simple . However , this balance is clearly needed for closing the gulf of execution but is missing in many existing interactive approaches to co - creation . Second , to minimize the gulf of evaluation , sensemaking of generated results should be facilitated . Users should be able to more easily understand how the given controls relate to what the AI generated . This is often missed in ‘explainable’ AI approaches . The explanation does not map to either the user’s intent or how they interface with the software . 8 . 2 Generalizing Line Sketching Control Beyond story generation , line sketching can potentially be adopted for other applications that generate content with sequence at - tributes . This is particularly true in domains where we can op - erationalize and encode features of the content as drawings . For example , poetry [ 14 ] and lyrics [ 147 ] can be visualized based on moods or rhythms . One indicator of whether the line sketching approach is appropriate for a generative context is if time - series style visualizations already exist in that medium . For example , in audio , we can visualize ( and partially control ) changes in volume over time . This can be extended to support more powerful types of guidance . For example , a composer could control rhythmic density or melodic contour [ 2 ] of generated outputs . Similarly , a sketch line could be used with a text - to - speech generator for flexible micro expression control ( e . g . , pace or aggressiveness ) [ 128 ] . 8 . 3 Disagreement Between Human and AI In our experiments , we found situations in which the controlled generation do not satisfy a user’s expectation , and the generated text’s fortune level might not accord with the given controls . This can be due to algorithmic error , either from the controlled gener - ation or recognition . However , we found that in some cases this was a result of an implausible request ( e . g . , drastic fluctuation of fortune ) . Dramatic fluctuations are not often observed in real text and the generative algorithms may not be able to generate suitable text . To address this , we might limit how much the sketch can move between time steps ( e . g . , a smoothing ) . Alternatively , we can lever - age the ambiguity and undetermined nature of sketching [ 49 , 84 ] to communicate uncertainty in control . In our prototype , as the user sketches , we show a wide range where the generated output would likely fall . While these design elements manage user expec - tations on the tightness of the control , our user study found that users would want more sensitive controls when they iterate over generations with small changes in parameters . The sketch - speed approach is one way to allow users to encode how ‘tightly’ they want the story to fit . However , it may be worth considering alter - native approaches in the future ( e . g . , explicitly selecting different ‘pen’ widths or experimenting with things like pen pressure ) . As our user study revealed , the writer’s perception of the protag - onist’s fortune can also be misaligned with how the tool recognizes it . Adapting the machine’s fortune scale to the user’s perception can be a way to solve this . For example , we can allow users to revise the machine recognition results based on their perception of the text ( e . g . , by moving the line the machine drew ) . This can be fed back to the underlying classifier to learn the user’s scale of fortune . To en - able such interactions with low user effort , it should be technically possible to adjust models with few data instances from the user . Recent language model tuning approaches , including soft prompt tuning [ 87 , 93 ] , may support this approach . In some situations , the user’s expectation may be mismatched due to the potential bias in the model or training data . For example , our study participants mentioned the model seemed to show biased behaviors , such as generating stories more likely written in western cultures , which might be due to skewed distribution in the variety of stories [ 9 ] . To alleviate this problem , we can try pretraining big language models with balanced data [ 9 ] or having a controllable module that tries to control these biases [ 76 , 91 ] . 8 . 4 Further Support in Story Co - creation Story attributes other than the protagonist’s fortune ( e . g . , conflict , settings ) can also steer the story flow . To decide which attribute to support , the writer’s specific needs should be understood first . Based on the identified attribute , visual controls can be designed to assure expressive and simple control for the attribute . For exam - ple , if writers want textual keywords to be used as control [ 152 ] , placing keywords along the story sequence axis can be one design option . Alternatively , if a writer wants to convey condensed in - formation about character interaction , diagramming a character network graph can be a control option [ 4 ] . For example , one could imagine drawing multiple instances of a network diagram to guide the AI by which characters in a story should interact and how . Alternative sketched representations are worth studying both for TaleBrush : Sketching Stories with Generative Pretrained Language Models CHI ’22 , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA text generation [ 103 ] and beyond . To support these , the dataset and algorithmic pipeline would need to be expanded based on the attribute to be controlled . For specific story domains , such as screenwriting , generation can be extended to adopt the “show , not tell” approach . For such extensions , the dataset would need to be constructed with screen scripts while the algorithms would also need to consider the latent fortune states throughout the story . TaleBrush can potentially be extended to support the author - ing of high - fidelity , longer text . To provide such support , the tool would need to consider writers in the translation stage [ 44 , 48 ] , where ideas and plans are transformed into detailed text . Hence , generative tools should be able to follow the writer’s specifications . The annotation approach would also need to be reconsidered , such as annotating the fortune of the character after summarizing the long text with crowdsourcing [ 141 ] or algorithms [ 8 ] . Moreover , the control and sensemaking should be re - designed for longer text . For example , a tool might allow the writer to first sketch an outline and then a detailed story [ 40 ] . A more complete tool might enable a long - term study of how co - creation impacts writing . 8 . 5 Limitation and Future Work In this work , we qualitatively investigated how writers would use TaleBrush and sketching interactions . Future work can investigate how proposed interactions impact the story writing compared to writers’ current practices or when controlled generation is used without sketching interactions . Moreover , we did not look into how each function impacts story writing separately . For example , how would the control of surprise impact the writing experience alone ? To answer such questions , more controlled user experiments would be needed . While our annotation approach produced usable data , we identified ways it could be improved in the future . While collecting comparison information with the slider interface , we saw that how calibrating sentences were annotated would impact the annotation results . For example , if one calibrating sentence has been annotated with maximum fortune and the annotator later realizes that one of the task sentences has higher fortune , the annotator would either not annotate accurate comparison information or need to re - annotate the calibrating sentence . One possible approach is to modify the interface so that sliders can be extended without having maximum or minimum ends . Finally , while the training data specified which character’s fortune should be steered , the trained model frequently coupled multiple characters’ fortunes . For example , in the story about Bob and Alice , it is hard to make Bob have a good fortune and Alice have a bad one . Explicit control of multiple characters’ fortune can be one future work direction to handle this limitation . 9 CONCLUSION We introduce TaleBrush , a human - AI story co - creation tool that allows writers to sketch out textual stories by visually controlling the protagonist’s fortune . The visual sketch is used as an input to the GPT - based story generation model and the model generates stories according to the specified protagonist’s fortune . To help make sense of the generated story , the protagonist’s fortune is visualized using the same abstract representation as the drawn sketch . From our technical evaluation and user study , we found TaleBrush has reliable controllability , while its sketching interaction facilitates participants to iterate on generation to collect novel ideas that align with their intentions . With the recent advances in generative ML algorithms , we hope TaleBrush opens up new ways to provide frictionless and intuitive controls .
