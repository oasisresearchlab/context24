Regarding yeasts , 4 the effect of cell surfaces is often overlooked , despite the fact that generalisations may 5 not be made between closely related strains . The current investigation compared 6 adhesion of three industrially relevant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( M - type , 7 NCYC 1681 and ALY , strains used in production of Scotch whisky , ale and lager , 8 respectively ) to the biomaterial hydroxylapatite ( HAP ) . Adhesion of the whisky yeast 9 was greatest , followed by the ale strain , while adhesion of the lager strain was 10 approximately 10 - times less . According to microbial adhesion to solvents ( MATS ) 11 analysis , the ale strain was hydrophobic while the whisky and lager strains were 12 moderately hydrophilic . This contrasted with analyses of water contact angles where all 13 strains were characterised as hydrophilic . All yeast strains were electron donating , with 14 low electron accepting potential , as indicated by both surface energy and MATS 15 analysis . Overall , there was a linear correlation between adhesion to HAP and the 16 overall surface free energy of the yeasts . This is the first time that the relationship 17 between yeast cell surface energy and adherence to a biomaterial has been described . 18 19 Keywords : Hydroxylapatite , cell adhesion , Saccharomyces , surface properties , hydrophobicity 20 3 Introduction 1 The adhesion of yeast to abiotic surfaces has major implications for biomedical , 2 environmental and bioprocessing industries . In the medical field , adhesion of 3 microorgansisms to the surfaces of bioimplants and human tissues is an imperative step 4 in the pathogenesis of infection . Pathogenic yeast such as Candida spp . produce 5 biofilms on medical devices , which renders them relatively refractory to medical 6 therapy ( Kojic and Darouiche 2004 ) . In industry , biofouling of surfaces in food 7 processing equipment , fermenters , heat exchangers and cooling water systems is 8 problematic . However , in certain cases adhesion of microorganisms may be desirable . 9 Many wastewater treatment and bioremediation systems depend upon biofilm 10 formation . In brewing and wine fermentations , cell - cell adhesion ( flocculation ) is a 11 desirable property of S . cerevisiae strains , allowing the easy separation of cells from the 12 fermentation media ( Verstrepen et al . 2003 ) . The adhesion of microorganisms is 13 inherent in immobilised cell technology with immobilised yeast systems offering 14 considerable advantages to the fermentation industry ( Kourkoutas et al . 2004 ; Verbelen 15 et al . 2006 ) . Immobilised yeast systems have been used in ethanolic fermentations with 16 successful adhesion of S . cerevisiae to diverse solid carriers such as polyurethane foam 17 ( Baptista et al . 2006 ) , spent grains ( Dragone et al . 2007 ) , ceramics ( Demuyakor and 18 Ohta 1992 ) , and porous glass ( Tata et al . 1999 ) . 19 The adhesion of yeast to a surface is the first step in immobilisation and results 20 from complex physicochemical interactions between the cell , the surface and the liquid 21 phase . It depends on physicochemical properties of the support and cells ( surface 22 charge , hydrophobicity , functional groups , electron donor - electron acceptor properties 23 and support porosity and roughness ) and environmental conditions ( ionic strength , 24 4 temperature and contact time ) . Initial interactions between microbes and biomaterials 1 may be explained by the extended DLVO ( Derjaguin , Landau , Verwey , Overbeek ) 2 theory , which considers the four fundamental , non - covalent interactions : Lifshitz - van 3 der Waals , electrostatic , Lewis acid - base and Brownian motion forces ( van Oss et al . 4 1986 ; Bos et al . 1999 ) . The first two are usually termed long - range forces i . e . initially 5 involved in bringing the two surfaces together , while Lewis acid - base depends on short - 6 range specific interactions between molecular groups . Research has mainly focused on 7 the influence of the support surface properties on adhesion ( Guillemot et al . 2006 ; Kang 8 and Choi 2005 ; Vernhet and Bellon - Fontaine 1995 ) , while there has been little 9 information on the influence of yeast surface properties . This is surprising as not all 10 yeasts bind in the same manner and generalisations concerning the hydrophobic and 11 acid - base properties of microbial cell surfaces may not be made ( Van der Mei et al . 12 1998 ) . One of the main aims of this research was to compare the surface characteristics 13 of three industrially relevant S . cerevisiae strains and to distinguish the influence of 14 these properties on adhesion potential to hydroxylapatite ( HAP ) . 15 HAP [ Ca 5 ( PO 4 ) 3 OH ] has numerous biomedical applications and is the most 16 bioactive material that can bond directly to living bone . Its affinity for proteins is 17 exploited in high performance liquid chromatography systems ( Kandori et al . 2005 ) and 18 its metal adsorption capacity is used for removal of metals ( Baillez et al . 2007 ; Gómez 19 del Río et al . 2004 ; Misra et al . 2007 ) . It is used widely in medicine as bioactive 20 ceramic materials for bone and dental implants ( Gross and Berndt 2002 ; Ong and Chan 21 2000 ; Itoh et al . 2006 ) . However , like all bioimplants , it is susceptible to microbial 22 infections . It is therefore apparent that an understanding of the factors controlling 23 5 adhesion of yeasts to surfaces is important from both medical and industrial 1 perspectives . 2 In this paper , the adhesion profiles of three S . cerevisiae strains , used in Scotch 3 whisky , ale and lager beer production , respectively , to HAP were compared . Ale and 4 lager yeast strains were selected , as they have known differences in surface properties 5 leading to specific flocculation characteristics at the end of fermentation . Yeast flocs 6 may sediment to the bottom ( lager yeast ) or float to the surface ( ale yeast ) , thereby 7 facilitating their separation from the medium . Top - fermenting strains are often 8 described as being more hydrophobic compared to bottom - fermenting strains ( Dengis 9 and Rouxhet 1997 ) while there are also major differences in the polysaccharide 10 properties of the two strain types ( Alsteens et al . 2008 ) . S . cerevisiae ‘M - type’ strain 11 was also compared as it is central to whisky production in Scotland . The van der Waals , 12 electron donor and acceptor characteristics of cells were assessed by two methods : 13 surface energy characterisation by contact angle ( Zhao et al . 2005 ) and microbial 14 adhesion to solvents , MATS analysis ( Bellon - Fontaine et al . 1996 ) . These properties 15 were then compared with the extent of cell adhesion to HAP . 16 17 Materials and Methods 18 S . cerevisiae strains and culture conditions 19 S . cerevisiae M - type , whisky strain ( Kerry Biosciences Ltd , Menstrie , Scotland ) , NCYC 20 1681 , ale strain ( National Centre for Yeast Culture , Norwich , England ) and ALY , lager 21 strain ( University of Abertay yeast culture collection ) were routinely maintained on 22 malt extract agar slopes ( Oxoid Ltd . , Hampshire , UK ) . Yeasts were cultured in 100 ml 23 malt extract broth ( Oxoid ) in 250 ml Erlenmyer flasks at 25°C on a rotary shaker at 150 24 6 r . p . m . For experimental purposes , cells from 48 h cultures were used to inoculate 100 1 ml media to an initial density of 1  2 × 10 6 cells / ml . Cells were grown for 24 h and then 2 washed three times with 10 mM MES , pH 5 . 0 buffer by centrifugation at 1500 g prior to 3 use in adhesion or surface characterisation experiments . The concentration of yeast cells 4 was determined by counting with a haemocytometer . 5 6 Hydroxylapatite Tablets 7 HAP tablets ( 5 mm diameter , 2  3 mm height ) , were supplied by the Institute of Silica 8 Materials , Riga Technical University , Latvia and prepared by dry pressings of HAP 9 nanopowders as described previously ( Aronov et al . 2007 ) . Tablets were pressed by a 10 two - stage compaction , with pressures of 250 and 375 MPa for the first and second 11 stages , respectively . After pressing , tablets were sintered with a heating rate of 5°C / min 12 to 1100°C with annealing at this temperature for 1 hour . 13 14 Yeast adhesion to HAP 15 Yeast cells from 24 h cultures were washed with 10 mM MES , pH 5 . 0 buffer and re - 16 suspended to a cell density of 10 8 cells / ml . For each adhesion experiment , three tablets 17 were incubated with 3 ml yeast suspension at 25°C for 24 h with manual agitation of 18 samples during the incubation . Replicate samples were prepared for assessing adhesion 19 by two methods : ( i ) direct enumeration of cells following sonication and ( ii ) 20 quantitative microscopic analysis by methylene blue - staining of cells in situ . After 21 immobilisation , tablets were rinsed with MES buffer . Immobilised cells were visualised 22 by fixing cells with 1 : 1 ethanol / diethyl ether , staining with 0 . 01 % methylene blue and 23 rinsing with water . Images of stained cells on the surface of HAP were obtained using a 24 7 light microscope ( Leica DMR Fluorescent microscope , Leica Microsystems , Richmond 1 Hill , ON , Canada ) fitted with a 20× lens and with top illumination of the HAP surface 2 with an external lamp . Images were captured with a digital camera . To quantitatively 3 assess the degree of immobilisation , cells were detached from HAP into buffer using a 4 sonicating water bath ( ELMA Sonic S30H , Singen , Germany ) for 30 s . The number of 5 cells released per tablet was determined by the standard count plate method on malt 6 extract agar . All qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed in triplicate . 7 The viability of immobilised cells was confirmed by comparing tablets stained 8 with either Cell Tracker Orange CMRA or bis ( 1 , 3 diethylthiobarbituric acid ) trimethine 9 oxonol , DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 ( both from Molecular Probes , Invitrogen Corp , Paisley , UK ) . 10 Stock solutions , 0 . 1 mg ml - 1 CMRA and 1 mg ml - 1 DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 , were prepared in 11 dimethyl sulfoxide . Immobilised tablets were incubated with either 10 μl CMRA or 0 . 5 12 μl DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 for 20 min in 10 mM PIPES , 0 . 9 % NaCl , pH 7 . 0 buffer . Fluorescent 13 cells were examined using a Leica DM R fluorescent microscope fitted with Filter Cube 14 I3 ( blue excitation filter , bandpass 450 - 490 nm ; green dichromatic mirror 510 nm ) . It 15 was previously confirmed with planktonic yeast cells that CMRA stained all the cell 16 population while DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 , which is negatively charged , could only enter dead cells 17 ( results not shown ) . 18 19 MATS testing of yeast 20 The hydrophobic and Lewis acid - base ( electron donor / acceptor ) characteristics of yeast 21 cell surfaces were determined using the MATS test as first described by Bellon - 22 Fontaine et al . ( 1996 ) . The MATS test compares affinity of microbial cells for pairs of 23 monopolar / apolar solvents of similar Lifshitz - Van der Waals surface tension 24 8 components . Affinity to the following pairs of solvents was compared : ( i ) the apolar 1 solvent hexadecane and the acidic monopolar solvent , chloroform and ( ii ) the apolar 2 solvent decane and the strongly basic , monopolar solvent ethyl acetate . As these 3 solvents have different surface tension properties , differences between the affinity of 4 chloroform and hexadecane and between ethyl acetate and decane are indicative of the 5 electron - donor or electron - acceptor properties of the yeast surfaces , respectively . The 6 hydrophobic character is reflected by affinity for the apolar solvents . 7 The MATS test was adapted for use with yeast cells ( Mortensen et al . 2005 ) . 8 Briefly , yeast cells from 24 h cultures were washed with 10 mM MES , 0 . 9 % NaCl , pH 9 5 . 0 buffer and re - suspended to an optical density ( OD ) of 0 . 8 at 400 nm ( A 0 ) . NaCl was 10 included to prevent any electrostatic repulsion between similarly charged solvent 11 droplets and yeast cells . To start the test , 0 . 4 ml solvent was added to 2 . 4 ml cell 12 suspension and vortex - mixed for 1 min . The mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min to 13 ensure complete separation of the two phases before a 1 ml sample was carefully 14 removed from the aqueous phase and OD measured at 400 nm ( A ) . The percentage of 15 bound cells was subsequently calculated by 16 x100 A A - 1 affinity % 0    ( 1 ) 17 where A 0 is the OD measured at 600 nm of the cell suspension before mixing and A is 18 the absorbance after mixing . 19 20 Alcian blue dye retention assay 21 Adsorption of alcian blue by yeast cells was used as an indicator of cell surface charge 22 according to the method of Powell et al . ( 2003 ) with some slight modifications . Yeast 23 9 cells from 24 h cultures were centrifuged at 1500 g for 3 min and cells resuspended in 1 10 mM MES buffer , pH 5 . 0 to a concentration of 5×10 6 cells / ml . Aliquots of 10 ml each 2 were washed a further two times and cells suspended in the same buffer containing 3 alcian blue ( 15 mg / l ) . The suspension was incubated for 5 min on an orbital shaker at 4 100 r . p . m . Samples were centrifuged ( 1500 g , 3 min ) and the dye remaining in the 5 supernatant determined by OD at 607 nm . The concentration of alcian blue was 6 determined by reference to an alcian blue standard curve prepared from the original 7 dye / buffer solution . Alcian blue retention by yeast was expressed as mg alcian blue per 8 10 6 cells . All yeast strains were tested in triplicate . 9 10 Contact angle measurements and surface energy calculations 11 Contact angles were obtained using the sessile drop technique with a Dataphysics OCA - 12 20 contact angle analyser as described by Liu and Zhao ( 2005 ) . The contact angles of 13 three test liquids were used for surface free energy calculations : distilled water , 14 diidomethane ( Sigma , Dorset , UK ) and ethylene glycol ( Sigma , Dorset , UK ) . The data 15 for surface tension components is provided in Table 1 . All measurements were made at 16 25°C . Due to the small size of the tablets , only one liquid contact angle could be 17 determined per tablet . At least 9 HAP tablets were examined for each test liquid with 18 mean values ± standard deviation reported . 19 The contact angle of yeast strains was measured on yeast lawns ( harvested after 20 24 h growth and washed by centrifugation as described above ) deposited on sterile 21 cellulose nitrate membranes with pore size 0 . 45 μm . Prior to contact angle 22 measurement , the yeast lawns were dried in the air to a certain state , indicated by stable 23 water contact angles over time . Usually this state lasted 30  60 min and indicated that 24 10 only bound water was present on the surface . Three independently grown samples of 1 each strain were assessed with five replicate measurements made for each test liquid . 2 The free surface energy ( γ iTOT ) and surface energy components ( Lifshitz - van der 3 Waals , γ iLW ; electron acceptor , γ i + ; and electron donor , γ i – ) of the yeast surfaces and 4 HAP tablets were calculated according to the method of Liu and Zhao ( 2005 ) as based 5 on the approach developed by van Oss et al . ( 1986 and 1988 ) . The surface free energy 6 ( γ iTOT ) was expressed as the sum of a Lifshitz - van der Waals apolar component ( γ iLW ) 7 and a Lewis acid - base polar component ( γ iAB ) : 8 ABi LWi TOTi γ γ γ   ( 2 ) 9 where 10    i i ABi γ γ 2 γ ( 3 ) 11 Hydrophobicity , ΔG iwi was calculated as the free energy of interaction between two 12 similar solute molecules immersed in water as defined by van Oss ( 1995 ) : 13                    i i W i W W i i 2 LWW LWi iWi γ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ 4 γ γ 2 ΔG ( 4 ) 14 where , the subscripts i and w correspond to the properties of the molecules and water , 15 respectively . 16 Molecules or surfaces with ΔG iwi ≤  84 mJ / m 2 may be classified as completely 17 hydrophobic , partly hydrophobic for ΔG iwi between  84 and 0 and hydrophilic above 0 18 ( van Oss 1995 ) . 19 20 Results and Discussion 21 Adhesion of yeast strains to HAP 22 Adhesion of yeast to HAP was strain - dependent with the whisky strain being adhered to 23 the greatest extent , the ale strain being half that , while the lager strain was 10 - fold 24 11 lower . The number of cells immobilised per tablet was 4 . 3×10 5 , 2 . 2×10 5 and 3 . 1×10 4 for 1 M - type strain , NCYC 1681 and ALY , respectively ( Table 2 ) . For enumeration , cells 2 were recovered from tablets by sonication . This method has been described previously 3 for recovery of yeast cells from non - porous supports ( Vernhet and Bellon - Fontaine 4 1995 ) and cell recovery was confirmed by the absence of methylene - blue stained cells 5 on sonicated tablets . Similar methods have been used to recover cells from HAP tablets 6 including sonication for staphylococci ( Kinnari et al . 2009 ) and vortexing used to 7 remove Candida sp . ( Pereira - Cenci et al . 2008 ) with enumeration by plate counts . When 8 comparing adhesion of different strains such direct methods are required , as assays such 9 as those based on assessing metabolic activity are strain - specific and would not be 10 applicable ( Pereira - Cenci et al . 2008 ) . Typical images of immobilised cells stained with 11 methylene blue are provided in Fig 1 . This clearly shows the difference in adhesion 12 levels of the three yeast strains . Viability of immobilised cells was confirmed by 13 staining with fluorescent probes . Two fluorescence probes were selected for use with 14 HAP in situ : one for staining total cells ( CMRA ) and the other for staining dead cells 15 only ( DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 ) . Typical images of immobilised M - type strain stained with either 16 CMRA or DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 is provided in Fig 2 . It is clear that the cells adhered to tablets 17 are viable as the number of DiSBAC ( 2 ) 3 - fluorescent cells was minimal . This confirms 18 the validity of using plate counts to determine the number of cells recovered by 19 sonication . 20 To overcome any interference of ions with potential binding sites on the HAP 21 surface , an ion - free buffer was chosen for adhesion studies ( the ionic strength of the 22 biological buffer MES is essentially zero ) . It is known that sodium and potassium ions 23 adsorb to HAP ( Henriques et al . 2004 ) and HAP undergoes surface solubility in 24 12 aqueous solution ( Bertazzo et al . 2010 ) . Ion - free buffer and static incubation were 1 chosen to minimise variation in incubation conditions and HAP dissolution . In this case , 2 differences in adhesion between the strains could be attributed to the characteristics of 3 the strains rather than variation in HAP surface properties . The different adhesive 4 interactions of the three strains presented here highlights the fact that the three strains of 5 S . cerevisiae do not interact with HAP in the same manner . 6 7 Yeast cell surface properties 8 To elucidate the reasons for different adhesion levels , the physicochemical properties of 9 the yeast strains were assessed . The alcian blue retention assay was used as an 10 indication of the overall negative charge of the yeast cell surface ( Table 2 ) . The strains 11 adsorbed similar levels of dye , with greater than 86 % of the dye removed in all cases . 12 Adsorption of positively charged alcian blue to cells is an electrostatic interaction . This 13 indicated that the overall cell wall electrostatic charge was not a principal determinant 14 in cell adhesion . 15 The Lifshitz - van der Waals , electron donor and electron acceptor characteristics 16 of the cells were assessed by two methods : MATS analysis and contact angle 17 measurements using the approach of van Oss ( van Oss 1986 and 1988 ) . MATS is a 18 qualitative method with the Lewis acid and base parameters being deduced by the 19 difference in cell affinity for apolar and polar solvent pairs that have similar van der 20 Waals properties , but differ in their electron donating ( in the case of hexadecane and 21 chloroform ) or electron accepting ( decane and ethyl acetate ) properties ( Bellon - 22 Fontaine et al . 1996 ) . Affinity of the yeasts for these solvents is presented in Fig 3 . 23 According to MATS , the ale strain was the most hydrophobic with 76 and 87 % affinity 24 13 for hexadecane and decane , respectively . The whisky and lager strains had similar 1 affinity for the apolar solvents , varying between 31 and 43 % . Based on this , these 2 strains would be described as moderately hydrophilic . The three S . cerevisiae strains 3 were strongly electron donating as indicated by M - type strain , NCYC 1681 and ALY 4 having 75 , 98 and 89 % affinity for chloroform , respectively . Yeast cells are 5 predominantly negatively charged due to the presence of carboxyl , phosphoryl and 6 hydroxyl groups . As the strains tested removed greater than 86 % of the positively 7 charged alcian blue from solution , this confirmed their overall electron donating 8 character . All strains had minimal electron accepting capacity with affinities for decane 9 greater than ethyl acetate in all cases . 10 Cell hydrophobicity properties as determined by contact angle measurements did 11 not concur with MATS analysis . According to MATS , the ale strain was hydrophobic 12 with a strong affinity for the apolar solvents , hexadecane and decane . In contrast , the 13 water contact angle for all yeast was less than 20° ( Table 3 ) and ΔG iwi was positive 14 ( Table 4 ) , indicating that all yeast were hydrophilic . It is argued that microbial adhesion 15 to solvents does not provide an accurate account of cell surface properties with only 16 contact angles providing a real estimate of cell surface hydrophobicity ( van der Mei et 17 al . 1998 ) . The water contact angles are within the range of those reported for other S . 18 cerevisiae strains . The water contact angle of wild type strain was 20 . 7° compared to 19 32 . 8° for a hydrophobic strain ( Nakari - Setälä et al . 2002 ) , the water contact angle for 20 baker’s yeast was 24 . 5° ( Kang and Choi 2005 ) and between 7 . 2 - 9 . 5° for S . uvarum 21 ( carlsbergensis ) ( Brányik et al . 2004 ) . 22 The total surface energy ( γ iTOT ) , Lewis acid - base polar components ( γ i + and γ i - ) 23 and Lifshitz - van der Waal parameter ( γ iLW ) were calculated from the contact angles of 24 14 three solvents ( apolar diidomethane and two polar solvents , water and ethylene glycol ) 1 ( Table 4 ) . The acid - base parameters indicate that all strains were electron donating with 2 low electron accepting capacity . All yeast strains had low electron acceptor potential 3 with γ i + less than 1 . This is in line with other reports ( Nakari - Setälä et al . 2002 ; Kang 4 and Choi 2005 ) . Most biological surfaces have a γ i + value which is exceedingly low ( i . e . 5 of the order of 0 . 1 mJ / m 2 or less ) and when hydrophilic , a high γ i – ( more than 28 . 5 6 mJ / m 2 ) and may be designated as essentially ‘monopolar’ ( van Oss 1995 ) . 7 The electron donating - electron accepting properties as determined by contact 8 angle MATS analysis is in agreement with contact angle measurements . For the three S . 9 cerevisiae strains tested , affinity for ethyl acetate was minimal and less than that for 10 decane , confirming the low electron acceptor capacity . ALY lager yeast and M - type 11 whisky yeast strains had similar affinities for hexadecane but the affinity of the lager 12 strain for chloroform was greater than M - type strain ( 89 compared to 75 % ) , indicating 13 that the lager strain was more electron donating . This corresponds to the γ i – parameter , 14 where the surface free energy component of ALY was greater than the M - type strain . 15 The HAP tablets were slightly hydrophobic with water contact angle of 53 . 7° and low 16 ΔG iwi value of 3 . 62 mJ / m 2 . The tablets were electron donating with negligible electron 17 accepting capacity . In this case the Lewis acid - base energy parameter was zero and the 18 overall surface energy ( 40 . 65 mJ / m 2 ) was directly dependent on the Lifshitz - van der 19 Waals component . 20 21 Relationship between yeast adhesion to HAP and surface properties 22 To elucidate a physicochemical basis for the variation in adhesion , the surface 23 properties of the yeasts were compared . Alcian blue retention was similar for all strains , 24 15 indicating that electrostatic forces involved in dye adsorption were not involved in HAP 1 adhesion . There was no direct relationship between affinity to the solvents used in 2 MATS and yeast adhesion . It is not surprising that the yeast strains have different 3 surface characteristics . Difference in cell wall composition of ale and lager strains has 4 been reported and is related to their flocculation behaviour at the end of brewing 5 fermentations . Ale strains are reported as being more hydrophobic than lager strains , 6 which is related to the higher protein content of the top - fermenting strain , compared to 7 the higher phosphate concentration of the bottom - fermenting strain ( Dengis and 8 Rouxhet , 1997 ) . This contributes to their settling character at the end of the 9 fermentation ; it is generally accepted that the more hydrophobic flocs of the top - 10 fermenting ale strains associate with the CO 2 bubbles and rise to the top of the 11 fermenter while the less hydrophobic lager flocs settle at the bottom . According to 12 MATS analysis of the three strains presented here , the ale strain could be characterised 13 as hydrophobic with the other strains being moderately hydrophilic . 14 The overall surface energy of the yeast strains correlated directly with adhesion 15 to HAP ( Fig 4 ) . It is known that adhesion of bacteria to biomaterials is dependent on the 16 surface energy of the biomaterial ( Liu and Zhao 2005 ) . However , we have demonstrated 17 that the surface energies of the microbial surfaces are also key factors in adhesion . This 18 is significant as it indicates that the overall properties of the yeast cell surface may be 19 used to predict the potential for adhesion to biomaterials . The differences in adhesion 20 and surface energy of the strains may be related to the nanomechanical properties of the 21 cell surface polymers . Differences in the cell wall elasticity and polysaccharide 22 properties of top and bottom brewing yeast strains as probed by atomic force 23 microscopy ( AFM ) have been reported ( Alsteens et al . 2008 ) . Polypeptides are more 24 16 exposed , or available for interaction on the S . cerevisiae surface ( top - fermenting strain ) 1 compared to the S . carlsbergensis surface ( bottom - fermenting strain ) . This is 2 comparable to the work presented here , with ALY , an example of a bottom - fermenting 3 lager yeast , showing the least level of interaction with HAP when compared to the ale 4 and whisky strains . 5 6 Acknowledgements 7 This work was funded by European Commission Project NMP3 - CT - 504937 8 ‘PERCERAMICS’ .
