Here , we elucidate the molecular motions that occur at the active site in the 47 temporal window immediately before and after ATP hydrolysis by merging cryo - EM , NMR 48 spectroscopy and MD simulations . p97 populates a metastable reaction intermediate , the 49 ADP . Pi state , which is poised between hydrolysis and product release . Detailed snapshots 50 reveal that the active site is finely tuned to trap and eventually discharge the cleaved phosphate . 51 Signalling pathways originating at the active site coordinate the action of the hexamer subunits 52 and couple hydrolysis with allosteric conformational changes . 53 Our multidisciplinary approach enables a glimpse into the sophisticated spatial and temporal 54 orchestration of ATP handling by a prototype AAA + protein . 55 56 57 58 3 The ATP - dependent enzyme p97 powers diverse energy - consuming processes in the cell . p97 59 is a homo - hexamer in which each subunit comprises two ATPase domains , D1 and D2 , that 60 assemble into two stacked rings ( Fig . 1a ) . Its N - terminal domain ( NTD ) recruits cofactors and 61 substrates and is positioned according to the nucleotide bound in D1 : elevated above the D1 - 62 ring when ATP is bound ( NTD ‚Äòup‚Äô ) and coplanar in ADP - bound form ( NTD ‚Äòdown‚Äô ) 1 , 2 . As a 63 result , the NTD undergoes a large - scale motion during the ATP - hydrolysis cycle . p97 is 64 member of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities ( AAA + ) superfamily that 65 features conserved functional elements for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis such as the 66 Walker A and B motifs , the arginine - finger and the sensor motifs 3 . As the p97 hexamer 67 assembles , twelve active sites emerge at the inter - subunit interfaces , allowing for allosteric 68 coordination of enzymatic activity among the subunits 3 . 69 We previously reported that in the presence of ATP and absence of cofactors and substrates , 70 p97 populates a uniform nucleotide state : D1 is occupied with ADP and still hosts the cleaved 71 phosphate ( P i ) ion 4 . Conformational analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 72 ( NMR ) indicated that the observed state is distinct from apo , ADP - or slowly - hydrolysable 73 ATP ùõæ S states . A reaction intermediate in which the bond between ùõæ - and Œ≤ - phosphate groups 74 of ATP has been cleaved but neither reaction product released was postulated 50 years ago and 75 termed ‚ÄòADP . P i ‚Äò state 5 . Due to its limited lifetime , it has been little characterized at the atomic 76 level . 77 Single - particle cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) enables structural analysis of such short - 78 lived species . While resolutions below 4 ‚Ñ´ are sufficient to establish the identity of the 79 nucleotide 1 , 6 , 7 , 8 , i . e . whether ATP or ADP is bound , it remains challenging to establish the 80 location of the cleaved P i ion as its distance to the nucleotide is not known a priori and its 81 location may fluctuate , causing smearing of the cryo - EM density . Exceptions are Hsp70 9 , F - 82 actin 10 , myosin 11 and F 1 - ATPase 12 , which all form stable ADP . P i adducts with exogeneous P i 83 ions that may not reflect the authentic reaction intermediates preceded by enzymatic hydrolysis 84 events . So far , no transient ADP . P i structure after P i cleavage has been reported or recognized 85 as such . 86 Here , we derive the structure of ADP . P i - bound p97 via cryo - EM and molecular dynamics 87 simulations ( MD ) . This snapshot of ATP processing reveals how the active site first 88 accommodates and then releases the cleaved P i ion . We dissect the contributions of active site 89 residues and identify the underlying triggers that induce domain motion upon hydrolysis . 90 Additionally , we map pathways that coordinate activity between adjacent subunits . Our 91 investigation sheds light on the structural transitions and dynamical changes that accompany 92 ATP processing by multimeric enzymes . 93 94 4 Results 95 96 Observation of a post - ATP - hydrolysis reaction intermediate . 97 98 Full - length ( fl ) p97 at physiological Mg 2 + ion and ATP concentrations in the presence of an 99 ATP - regeneration system was flash frozen and subjected to single - particle cryo - EM . The 100 reconstructed hexamers display no deviation from sixfold symmetry with all NTDs positioned 101 coplanar with the D1 ring . A C6 - symmetrized reconstruction pushed the final resolution to 102 2 . 61 ‚Ñ´ ( Fig . 1a ) . Overall , the structure of the D1 domain is similar to that of ADP - bound p97 1 . 103 Elements related to NTD ‚Äòdown‚Äô state are fully built , notably the helix - loop conversion in the 104 NTD - D1 linker and NTD - D1 interfaces . The nucleotides in D1 and D2 were assigned to ADP 105 and ATP , respectively ( Fig . E1 ) . While the ATP molecule is clearly defined , weak cryo - EM 106 densities are observed around the ADP molecule in D1 , hinting at the presence of additional 107 molecules and structural heterogeneity . 108 To confirm the identity of the p97 - bound nucleotide , we acquired 31 P NMR spectra of 109 nucleotide bound to p97 during ATP turnover ( Fig . 1b ) . Comparing the spectra acquired on fl 110 p97 to a variant lacking D2 domain ( p97 - ND1L , residues 1 - 480 2 ) , the ‚ç∫ - phosphate ( P ) and Œ≤ - 111 P signals of the ADP molecule in D1 can be assigned . In addition , multiple weaker signals are 112 attributed to P i ions trapped at the active site in a heterogenous environment . EM and NMR 113 concur that a metastable ADP . P i nucleotide state has been captured in D1 , which we subjected 114 to in - depth structural analysis . 115 5 116 117 118 119 Fig . 1 : Global conformational changes linked to nucleotide turnover in the tandem ATPase p97 . 120 a , Box : Single - particle cryo - EM reconstruction of p97 in ADP . P i state reveals a symmetric hexamer with NTD 121 domains in the ‚Äòdown‚Äô position ( 4 mM Mg 2 + , 10 mM ATP with regenerating system ; EMDB 16781 / 16782 , this 122 work ) . For comparison , reconstructions of ATP g S - and ADP - bound p97 are shown ( EMDB 3298 , 3299 1 ) . The 123 colouring of the cryo - EM maps reflects the bound nucleotides as shown below . Details on reconstruction in 124 Fig . S1 - 3 . b , Magic - angle spinning 1 H‚Üí 31 P cross polarization NMR spectra of p97 - bound nucleotide in the 125 presence of ATP ( top ) and ADP ( bottom ) . The p97 - ND1L hexamer ( residues 1 - 480 ) is ATPase active 2 and 126 contains only signals from D1 ; the corresponding spectra of fl p97 are shown in lighter hues . The observation of 127 multiple weaker signals ( orange fit ) is ascribed to phosphate ions in chemically distinct environments . These 128 signals must derive from the cleaved ùõæ - phosphate of ATP locked in the D1 active site since thio - substitution at 129 this position in ATP results in a strong downfield shift 4 . 130 131 132 133 6 Structure of the active site in ADP . P i state . 134 135 Unlike the clearly defined phosphate moieties of the ATP molecule in D2 , the cryo - EM density 136 of ADP in D1 is tailed , with unexplained densities emanating from the Œ≤ - P ( Fig . 2a , E1 ) and 137 close to the arginine finger R359 . We obtained a trajectory of the P i and Mg 2 + ions immediately 138 after ATP hydrolysis from MD simulations . Starting from ATP - bound p97 hexamer , the ATP 139 molecule in one of the six subunits was converted to ADP . P i in silico followed by 2 ¬µs of 140 unrestrained simulation . After rearrangements at the active site within the first few 141 nanoseconds , two clusters emerge indicating stable positions of the Mg 2 + and P i ions : ( i ) In the 142 first cluster , termed state A , the leaving P i ion is stabilized by Walker A residue K251 as well 143 as sensor residue N348 . R359 binds to P i but sometimes dissociates or binds via water . It is 144 much more mobile than N348 , which maintains a persistent binding mode with respect to the 145 P i ion . ( ii ) In the second cluster , termed state B , the leaving P i is detached from K251 and 146 positioned closer to R359 and R362 , thus being pulled towards the adjacent , trans - acting 147 subunit . The clusters superimpose well with the unassigned cryo - EM densities ( Fig . 2a ) . 148 In - silico analysis suggests that the Mg 2 + ion stabilizes the leaving P i , compensating the 149 Coulombic repulsion from the Œ≤ - P of ADP . In both states , an octahedral coordination geometry 150 of the Mg 2 + ion is achieved ( Fig . E2a , b ) . Compared to the ATP state ( Fig . E2c ) , the Mg 2 + ion 151 dissociates from T252 and instead interacts with Walker B residue D304 , either directly or 152 bridged via water molecules . With regard to the protonation state of the leaving P i ion , only the 153 simulation featuring HPO 42‚àí is in agreement with the experimental cryo - EM density of the 154 ADP . P i state , while the simulation featuring H 2 PO 4‚àí exhibits conformations and dynamics 155 nearly identical to those of the ATP state . ( Fig . E2d , e ) . 156 In our cryo - EM map of the ADP . P i state , the side chains of three residues at the active site exist 157 in two rotamers : R359 and F360 that interact with the nucleotide in trans as well as H384 in 158 cis ( discussed below ) . In the simulations , the F360 rotamer motion is correlated to the 159 interaction mode between the cleaved phosphate and R359 ( Fig . 2b , Video S1 ) . The head - on 160 bidentate complex of the P i ion with two amino groups in state A is linked to the F360 œá 1 = 161 180¬∞ conformer while the lateral monodentate complex of R359 in state B is linked to the œá 1 = 162 - 60¬∞ conformer . 163 By iterative integration of MD and EM , we determined the positions of the leaving P i and Mg 2 + 164 ions as well as the associated conformations of active - site residues ( Fig . E3 ) . The following 165 features set apart the ADP . P i state from the ADP and ATP ùõæS states ( Fig . 2c ) : the active site is 166 heterogeneous with at least two distinct positions for P i and Mg 2 + ions ; K251 interacts more 167 with the leaving P i than with ADP ; the Mg 2 + ion has dissociated from T252 to interact with 168 D304 ; N348 coordinates the P i ion ; R359 and F360 occupy two side chain rotamer states , 169 reflected in ¬µs - time - scale motion in MD simulations . 170 7 171 Fig . 2 : Coordination of the cleaved P i ion in D1 . 172 a , Zoom on the unaccounted density at the D1 active site . Snapshots from the MD trajectory evaluated at 2 ns 173 intervals identify at least two locations each for P i and Mg 2 + . The convergence between MD and cryo - EM enables 174 the assignment of Mg 2 + ( cyan for state A , dark blue for state B ) , cleaved P i and R359 / F360 rotamers ( light for 175 state A , dark green for state B ) . The iterative modelling process is outlined in Fig . E3 . b , In MD simulations of 176 the ADP . P i state , R359 and F360 undergo a correlated motion on a ¬µs - time scale , evidenced by fluctuations of the 177 side chain dihedral angle ( F360 c 1 ) and the phosphate - arginine binding geometry . A transition between the two 178 stable geometries , states A and B , occurs here after ~ 1200 ns . The side chain rotamers are visible in the 179 experimental cryo - EM density . c , Juxtaposition of the D1 nucleotide binding pocket in ATP g S ( PDB : 5ftn 1 ) , ADP 180 ( PDB : 5ftk 1 ) and ADP . P i states ( PDB : 8cpf , this work ) . 181 182 8 Contribution of individual residues to the processing of ATP . 183 184 The D1 domain contains both signature AAA + motifs and elements unique to p97 ( Fig . 3a ) . 185 To explore the roles of the active - site residues , we conducted biophysical assays on point - 186 mutated p97 - ND1L . Each mutant was subjected to a stepwise assessment of defects in 187 assembly , nucleotide binding , and ATPase activity ( Fig . E4 ) . We further mapped the 188 conformational dynamics as a function of bound nucleotide by NMR ( Fig . E5 ) . 189 The results are summarized in Fig . 3b , c . Briefly , all mutants except K251A bind ADP and 190 ATP ùõæ S ; all mutations except F360A / P reduce the ATPase activity . The NTD position ( ‚Äòup‚Äô vs . 191 ‚Äòdown‚Äô ) is linked to nucleotide state ( apo / ATP vs . ADP ) with the exception of D304N and 192 F360P , which assume the ‚Äòdown‚Äô conformation in the presence of slowly hydrolysable ATP 193 analogues . The ‚Äòup‚Äô conformation of the apo state is not compromised in any mutant . Before 194 ATP hydrolysis , the side chain of D304 hydrogen bonds with water molecules coordinating the 195 Mg 2 + ion . Removing its charge leads to loss of Mg 2 + and concomitant failure to recognize 196 bound ATP and assume the ‚Äòup‚Äô conformation ( Fig . S6 ) . 197 In the ADP . P i state , F360 equally populates two rotamers while the static ATP g S state shows 198 a preferential F360 œá 1 dihedral of 180 1 , 13 . This is echoed in the MD simulations , where it is 199 only upon hydrolysis that F360 is unlocked and transiently dissociates from the helix ‚ç∫ 407 - 423 200 ( Fig . E6 ) . This ability of F360 to pull the arginine finger loop towards helix ‚ç∫ 407 - 423 could be 201 essential to lock the NTD into the ‚Äòup‚Äô state . The critical role of F360 is underpinned by its 202 conservation in p97 homologues but absence in AAA + proteins without an NTD ( Fig . 3a , S4 ) . 203 Disease - associated p97 mutants lack this rotamer switch 14 , display a dynamic NTD 15 and no 204 long - lived ADP . P i state 4 . F360 is the only site where mutation entails a gain of ATPase 205 function . Mobility at this site is indeed linked to ATP processing : crosslinking C360 to C410 206 abolishes ATPase activity ( Fig . 3d ) . 207 208 209 9 210 Fig . 3 : Function of active - site residues in the ATP - hydrolysis cycle . 211 a , Sequence alignment of human AAA + family proteins . While several key motifs are highly conserved , F360 is 212 unique to the p97 D1 domain ( Fig . S4 ) . b , ATPase rates of p97 - ND1L bearing point mutations at the active site 213 and their functional defects deduced from NMR analysis . All presented mutants form hexamers ; only N348Q 214 fully abolishes ATP hydrolysis ; only mutations of F360 have a stimulatory effect on phosphate release ; 215 * designates ATPase inactive mutants . Coupled NTD position‚Äô indicates whether the mutant exhibits the same 216 change in NTD position upon nucleotide binding as wild type ( wt ) p97 . ‚ÄòADP . P i state‚Äô indicates that this state is 217 observed during ATP turnover . c , Impact of mutations on the four steps of the ATP - hydrolysis cycle . d , In ADP . P i 218 state , F360 from the trans - acting subunit samples two side chain rotamer states , one of which contacts helix ‚ç∫ 407 - 219 423 of the active subunit . Crosslinking of C360 to this helix at C413 , but not the mutations alone , abolishes ATPase 220 activity of D1 . Œî designates a cysteine - free p97 variant . e , Criteria that define hydrolysis - active conformations 16 , 221 amended for p97 : i ) A water molecule next to the terminal phosphate ( dark green ) forms a hydrogen bond to E305 222 side chain ( light green ) . This lytic water molecule is polarized and thus activated for attack . ii ) R359 polarizes the 223 ùõæ - phosphate and is poised to hydrogen bond after cleavage ( blue ) . iii ) The ùõæ - phosphate is held in place by N348 224 via a hydrogen bond ( black ) . Simulations of the N348Q mutant lack hydrolysis - active conformations due to steric 225 hindrance from the longer Q side chain . 226 227 228 10 Determinants of ATP - hydrolysis competence . 229 Real - time NMR establishes that mutants with low ATPase activity ( P246T , P247A / K , E305Q , 230 R359K , Fig . 3b ) still form an ADP . P i state , pointing to slow product release but intact ATP 231 hydrolysis . However , the N348Q mutant with no measurable ATPase activity displays only the 232 NTD ‚Äòup‚Äô state in the presence of ATP ( Fig . S8 ) . The sensor residue N348 is thought to position 233 the water molecule for nucleophilic attack on ATP 17 . To recapitulate the suppression of ATP 234 hydrolysis , we evaluated the frequency of reactive conformations at the D1 active site in MD 235 simulations of wild type ( wt ) vs . N348Q p97 ( Fig . 3e ) . While three of five ATP - bound subunits 236 sampled reactive conformations with high frequency in the wt , all but one subunit were 237 practically inactive in the mutant ( statistics in Fig . S9 ) . The longer side chain of Q348 , which 238 congests the active site , disfavors the proper geometry for ATP hydrolysis . E305 is thought to 239 activate a water molecule for attack on the ùõæ - phosphate of bound ATP 16 , 17 . The E305Q 240 mutation strongly reduces the ATPase activity of D1 14 ; still , the rate - limiting step of the 241 catalytic cycle of this mutant remains product release 4 . 242 243 244 245 11 Dynamics in the sensor loop are coupled with product release . 246 247 Sequential ATP hydrolysis around the multimer ring has emerged as a plausible operation 248 mode for AAA + proteins 3 , 18 . A communication line between the active sites of adjacent 249 subunits must underlie such coordination . We hypothesized that the ‚Äòsensor loop‚Äô ( Fig . 4a ) 250 could assume this function in p97 D1 . Part of this loop converts from turn to 3 10 - helix between 251 ATP ùõæ S and ADP states . The ADP . P i state , however , still exhibits a conformation similar to 252 ATP ùõæ S , unlike the rest of the D1 domain ( Fig . E7 ) . Transitions of the loop can be monitored 253 via the central reporter residue I353 . Its NMR signals are distinct in ATP ùõæ S and ADP states 254 and exchange - broadened in ADP . P i state ( Fig . 4b ) , indicative of a loop motion occurring on a 255 millisecond time scale . A mutant series reveals a correlation between the extent of turn - helix 256 conversion and the ATP - turnover rate . Globally , all mutants display the spectral signature of 257 the ADP . P i state with NTD in ‚Äòdown‚Äô conformation . The I353 signals of the hyperactive 258 F360P / A mutants are significantly broadened ; at the other extreme , the signal of the hypoactive 259 R359K mutant overlaps with the ATP ùõæ S state . Apparently , the loop does not respond to ATP 260 hydrolysis with a structural or dynamical change in this mutant . 261 We compared the residue - wise C ‚ç∫ root mean square fluctuation ( RMSF ) of the sensor loop in 262 the MD simulation of a p97 - ND1L hexamer with five ATP and one ADP . P i bound subunits 263 ( Fig . 4c ) . For the wt , ATP hydrolysis increases structural fluctuations : the two subunits lining 264 the ADP . P i active site display distinct profiles with increased mobility . In simulations of mutant 265 p97 , however , loop mobility is increased for the hyperactive F360P and decreased for the 266 hypoactive R359K mutant irrespective of nucleotide state . The RMSF of R349 in the wt 267 significantly increases when the adjacent active site is in ADP . Pi state . The cryo - EM densities 268 of R349 in the ADP . P i map are not well defined , suggesting residual flexibility . 269 In sum , NMR and MD analyses concur that mobility and propensity for 3 10 - helix formation in 270 the sensor loop are linked to the ability of product release . As the loop directly connects 271 adjacent active sites , it is conceivable that its structural transition triggers sequential ATP 272 hydrolysis events , which have been observed when p97 is working asymmetrically in the 273 presence of cofactors and substrates 19 . 274 275 276 12 277 Fig . 4 : Inter - subunit communication channel connects active sites . 278 a , The sensor loop bridging the N348 of one nucleotide binding pocket to F360 of the anticlockwise adjacent 279 pocket changes conformation between ATP ( ùõæ S ) and ADP - bound states . In the ADP state , R349 - I353 form a 3 10 280 helix ; in the ADP . P i state , this transition is incomplete , making this loop the last structural element to convert after 281 ATP hydrolysis ( Ramachandran analysis in Fig . E7 ) b , The signal of the I353 CŒ¥ 1 - methyl group in the middle of 282 the loop displays line broadening in the ADP . P i state of wt p97 . For hydrolysis - competent mutants , the ATPase 283 activity correlates with the extent of conversion from an ATP ùõæ S - like to an ADP - like conformation . This 284 correlation could reflect the coupling of loop motions to product release , the rate - limiting step of the ATP - 285 hydrolysis cycle . c , C ‚ç∫ - RMSF fluctuations quantify the deviation of residues from their average position over the 286 course of the 2 ¬µs MD trajectory . In wt p97 , mobility is pronounced in sensor loops neighbouring ADP . P i - bound 287 but not ATP - bound pockets . In the hyperactive F360P mutant , mobility is increased in all subunits , irrespective 288 of nucleotide state ; in the hypoactive R359K mutant it is strongly decreased in all subunits . The corresponding 289 RMSD analysis is shown in Fig . S10 , excerpts from the MD simulations in Videos S2 , S3 . 290 291 292 13 Energetics of phosphate binding and release . 293 The ADP . P i state of the R359K mutant is particularly long - lived , suggesting that a specific 294 interaction mode of the P i ion with R359 might be a prerequisite to induce product dissociation . 295 In MD simulations , its guanidinium moiety interacts exclusively with the P i ion and not with 296 ADP . In contrast , the side chain of K359 preferentially coordinates between the P i and the Œ≤ - P 297 of ADP , where it shields negative charges and stabilizes the ADP . P i complex in a similar 298 manner as the Mg 2 + ion ( Fig . E8b , Video S2 ) . While the K359 mutant populates only state A , 299 the wt features transitions between states A and B . 300 To quantify the stability of wt states A vs . B vs . K359 mutant , we conducted MMPBSA 301 ( Molecular Mechanics Poisson - Boltzmann Surface Area 20 ) calculations to estimate the 302 interaction energy of the P i ion to the ADP . P i state of p97 . This method also allows 303 decomposition of total free energies into the most stabilizing ( Mg 2 + , K251 ; Fig . 5a ) and 304 destabilizing ( ADP ; Fig . E8a ) contributions . We here consider the P i ion as the ligand and p97 - 305 ADP - Mg 2 + as the receptor . Although R359 interacts with the P i ion both in the simulations and 306 the cryo - EM , it is not necessary for achieving a stable ADP . P i state ; the presence of a Mg 2 + ion 307 bridging ADP and P i is sufficient . In contrast to the stable binding pose in state A of wt ( ŒîG ~ - 308 19 kcal / mol ) and K359 mutant ( ŒîG ~ - 39 kcal / mol ) , P i binding is predicted as unstable in state 309 B ( ŒîG ~ + 3 . 5 kcal / mol ) , chiefly due to the repulsion between ADP and P i . Thus , transitions 310 from state A to B could mark the onset of P i dissociation events in p97 wt . In contrast , the 311 R359K mutant has no state B equivalent with positive ŒîG and an even stronger stabilization 312 of the P i ion compared to wt state A . This combination manifests in inefficient product release 313 and low ATP turnover rates . 314 Over the 2 ¬µs - simulation , the ADP . P i state remains stable as long as cations bridging ADP to 315 P i are present . We therefore expedited complex dissociation by removing the Mg 2 + ion 316 artificially . In the resulting trajectory ( Fig . 5b ) , the P i travels from the active site towards the 317 centre of the hexamer to dissociate through the central pore along a channel lined by positive 318 charges ( Fig . 5c ) . Intriguingly , the ion is handed over from R359 of the trans - acting subunit to 319 R349 of the cis - acting subunit , which mark the end and the start of the respective sensor loops . 320 To probe the effective contributions of individual residues to P i evacuation , we generated a 321 series of point mutants altering charges or exchanging R‚ÜîK and determined their ATPase 322 activities ( Fig . 5d , E8d ) . Removal of R but not K strongly reduces ATPase rates ; the 323 replacement of K by R cannot rescue slow - release mutants . In line with the MMPBSA analysis , 324 the sequential interaction of the P i ion with R359 , R349 , R313 could mark the onset of P i 325 release . The active site and dissociation channel are finely evolved to ensure both the initial 326 stabilization and the eventual evacuation of the reaction products . 327 328 14 329 330 Fig . 5 : Pathway of phosphate dissociation . 331 a , Free energies of ADP .

Right : ATPase 338 activities of the corresponding p97 - ND1L point mutants . The mutation of R but not K residues causes a drastic 339 decrease in ATPase activity ( additional mutants in Fig . E8d . ) 340 341 342 15 Signalling of hydrolysis - induced domain motion 343 344 The NTD position is controlled allosterically by the nucleotide state in D1 : in apo and ATP ( ùõæS ) - 345 bound states , it is detached from and elevated above D1 domain ; in ADP . P i and ADP - bound 346 states , it moves downward to form an extensive interface . This process is not observed in our 347 MD simulation , which captures only 2 ¬µs immediately after hydrolysis . However , we could 348 identify the minimal structural signal to stabilize the NTD to the coplanar position by titrating 349 P i ions to apo p97 - ND1L ( Fig . 6a ) . Simulations corroborate the experimental result , suggesting 350 that two P i ions bridged by a monovalent cation bind stably to apo - p97 . They adopt the same 351 positions as P i and Œ≤ - P in the ADP . P i state ( Fig . 6b ) . The resulting complex reproduces the two - 352 pronged interaction between P i and the R359 guanidinium group as well as the rotamer 353 switches of F360 œá 1 ( Fig . 6c ) . 354 From the active site , structural changes induced by ATP hydrolysis must be relayed towards 355 the NTD where they ultimately induce a downward motion . We evaluated the RMSF of C ‚ç∫ 356 atoms over the trajectory and visualized their ratio between ADP . P i to ATP subunits as a heat 357 map on the MD structure in Fig . 6d and E10a . The interaction between the leaving P i and R359 358 induces the dissociation ( state A ) and re - association ( state B ) of F360 with respect to helix ‚ç∫ 407 - 359 423 and thereby increases the plasticity of the arginine finger loop and the entire active site . This 360 increased plasticity propagates towards the periphery of D1 : first along the NTD - D1 linker ; 361 second along the helix extending from the Walker A motif towards the NTD ; third along helix 362 ‚ç∫ 407 - 423 from the ribose moiety towards the trans - acting subunit ; fourth from the adenine moiety 363 along helix Œ± 374 - 387 towards the NTD . The latter effect is reflected in the cryo - EM map : only in 364 ADP . P i state does H384 display a second side chain rotamer that contacts the ribose . The 365 nucleotide is thus slightly repositioned , helix Œ± 374 - 387 shifts with respect to ATPŒ≥S state , leading 366 to a flipping of N387 located at the end of the helix . The repositioning of N387 in turn enables 367 the formation of an electrostatic network with NTD residues that fix the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state 368 ( Fig . E10b , Video S5 ) . Even though P i ions are sufficient to evoke the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state of the NTD , 369 the nucleoside moiety still contributes to the signaling of ATP hydrolysis . The MD trajectory 370 cannot capture the downward motion of the NTD , yet it pinpoints early dynamical changes that 371 could eventually pave the way for this large - scale conformational transition . 372 373 16 374 Fig . 6 : Allosteric control of NTD motion . 375 a , NMR probes indicate a conformational change of the NTD induced by addition of 100 mM P i ions to apo p97 , 376 reflected by peak shifts from ‚Äòup‚Äô ( ATP ùõæ S - like ) to ‚Äòdown‚Äô ( ADP . P i - like ) position ( titration in Fig . E9a ) . This P i 377 concentration is above physiological intracellular levels . The same effect was observed for arsenate and sulphate 378 ions ( Fig . E9b ) . b , Snapshot from MD simulations ( Video S4 ) of the apo D1 nucleotide binding pocket . Two P i 379 ions mimic the ADP . P i state ( transparent ) and occupy the same positions as the Œ≤ - P of ADP and the leaving P i , 380 bridged by a K + or Na + ion from the solvent . No Mg 2 + ion is necessary to stabilize this arrangement in simulation 381 or experiment . c , The MD trajectory of P i - bound p97 reveals a mobile F360 side chain that switches between 382 rotamers corresponding to states A and B ( Fig . 2b ) ; R359 stably coordinates a P i ion via its N Œµ atom and one amino 383 group . d , Top view of one D1 subunit colour coded according to the ratio of backbone RMSF of ADP .

Fig . E10 ) . e , Summary of the function of residues at the 388 p97 D1 active site . Categories were assigned either according to structural contributions evident from MD or cryo - 389 EM or according to mutagenesis - induced defects in ATP processing . 390 391 17 Discussion 392 393 Resolving the mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis is catalysed and the concomitant release 394 of chemical energy is conveyed to mechanical motion is a major challenge in the field of 395 enzymology . Structures of transiently captured intermediates allow dissection of the catalytic 396 cycle into experimentally grounded snapshots . The ADP . P i intermediate , in which the bond 397 between ùõæ - and Œ≤ - phosphate groups has been cleaved but neither the P i ion nor ADP has been 398 released yet , has been poorly characterized . Its existence was first postulated for myosin 5 , in 399 which a stable ADP . P i complex can be artificially induced with exogenous P i ‚Äì a property 400 shared by myosin 11 , F - actin 10 and Hsc70 9 . However , structures of such stable complexes may 401 not reflect the authentic short - lived states during enzymatic hydrolysis nor do they cover any 402 members of the most prevalent nucleotide - binding fold , the P - loop NTPases 22 . 403 We report here the 2 . 6 ‚Ñ´ cryo - EM structure of the human ATPase p97 captured in a transient 404 ADP . P i state , which converges with MD simulations of the same state . Mutagenesis and NMR 405 analyses identify the contributions of active - site residues to ATP turnover , summed up in 406 Fig . 6e . The structures capture molecular motions that accompany ATP hydrolysis : The 407 cleaved P i travels together with the Mg 2 + ion , which is stabilized by water molecules and 408 coordination to D304 . P i release is coupled with rotamer exchanges in the arginine finger loop . 409 A further rotamer exchange of H384 triggers a conformational transition that could ultimately 410 effect the large - scale motion of the NTD . A stable Mg 2 + ¬∑P i complex and water networks were 411 observed for F - actin 23 , 24 and Hsc70 25 , 26 , indicating a common mechanism whereby the Mg 2 + 412 ion plays a key role in P i release . Indeed , the ADP . P i state remains stable as long as bridging 413 cations are present in simulations . Notably , in a GHL ATPase , the switch of a K residue near 414 the nucleotide was proposed to trigger P i release , which parallels our finding of an arginine 415 finger rotamer switch 27 . 416 We identify a loop connecting the sensor I motif to the arginine finger of the counter - clockwise 417 subunit . Its ability to transition from turn to 3 10 helix between ATP , ADP . P i and ADP states is 418 correlated to efficient product release . p97 is a prototype member of the AAA + superfamily , 419 and ADP . P i states are frequently invoked in mechanistic models of these ring - shaped 420 oligomers 28 , 29 , 30 . A consensus has emerged that ATP hydrolysis proceeds counter - clockwise 421 in substrate - engaged AAA + proteins 3 , 18 . ADP release disrupts the subunit interface and causes 422 the respective subunit to move to the bottom of the spiral staircase and disengage from the 423 substrate 28 , 29 . Such models presume efficient inter - subunit communication elements , such as 424 the sensor loop identified in p97 . 425 p97 is the first AAA + protein for which a transient ADP . P i state has been captured to our 426 knowledge . A high kinetic barrier to P i dissociation , rendering release rate limiting , could be a 427 speciality of p97 - D1 : the conserved F residue in the arginine finger of p97 - D1 is replaced by P 428 in p97 - D2 and many AAA + . We show that F360 rotamer states regulate the NTD position and 429 are coupled with P i release . While ATP turnover in D1 is linked to NTD motion , D2 drives 430 substrate translocation 19 , 31 . 431 Our methodology delineates a general strategy to overcome resolution limits in the 432 characterization of short - lived and heterogeneous enzymatic reaction intermediates . Single - 433 particle cryo - EM affords the bulk of structure determination ; MD simulations validate the 434 18 interpretation of the map at the critical active site and introduce a time axis to connect multiple 435 structural states ; NMR assesses dynamical changes coupled with enzymatic events . 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 Extended Data 444 445 Extended Data Fig . 1 Nucleotides bound in D1 and D2 . 446 Zoom of the cryo - EM density that is assigned to the nucleotide bound to fl p97 in the presence of ATP . An ADP 447 molecule with two phosphate groups and an ATP molecule with three phosphate groups are clearly resolved in 448 the binding pockets of D1 and D2 domains , respectively . In MD simulations , Na + or K + ions are often found 449 binding to the ‚ç∫ - P of ADP in D1 , coinciding with unassigned electron density in this area . 450 451 452 453 454 19 455 Extended Data Fig . 2 Snapshots from MD simulations of D1 in different nucleotide states . 456 a - c , Octahedral coordination of the Mg 2 + ion in ADP .

P i state were determined by matching 466 the MD simulations ( left column ) to the residual cryo - EM density ( right column ) surrounding the ADP molecule 467 in D1 . a , Snapshots from simulations of ADP . P i state reveal at least two distinct stable geometries , termed states 468 A and B , which differ in the position of the P i and Mg 2 + ions . b , The side chains of R359 and F360 undergo a 469 correlated motion in the MD trajectory .

Methods are shown as grey circles : size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , isothermal 482 titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , NMR conformational analysis , ATPase rate measurement ; mutant properties are 483 shown as white boxes . Right top : ATPase rates of the mutants . Right bottom : The sequence of assays was pursued 484 as long as a given mutant was assessed positive in the previous category ( + , yellow background ) but not if it 485 behaved completely ( - ) or partially ( ~ ) different from the wt . 486 Annotations : * Mutant displays no detectable ATPase activity ; 1 spectral change detected in the presence of any 487 nucleotide , irrespective of type , NTD position mixed ; 2 NTD in ‚Äòdown‚Äô state in presence of slowly - hydrolysable 488 ATP analogues ; 3 ADP . P i state cannot be distinguished from the ATP state by NMR , precluding categorization of 489 the mutant . The corresponding NMR spectra are shown in Fig . E5 and S5 - 8 . The nucleotide dissociation constants 490 are listed in Table S7 . 491 22 492 Extended Data Fig . 5 NMR probes indicate global conformation and nucleotide state of p97 . 493 Selected spectral regions from HMQC spectra of proR - 13 CH 3 - ILVM - labelled p97 - ND1L wt acquired at 37 ¬∞C 494 ( apo ) or 50 ¬∞C ( all others ) . Residues V116 , V154 and V87 report on the NTD position 15 ( ‚Äòup‚Äô in apo , AMP - PNP 495 and ATP g S states vs . ‚Äòdown‚Äô in ADP and ADP . P i states ) , while residues I206 and L268 report on the conformation 496 of the D1 active site and its bound nucleotide . ATP g S 32 and AMP - PNP 33 are slowly hydrolysable analogues of 497 ATP . When a mutant assumes the NTD ‚Äòdown‚Äô position in the presence of ATP g S , this can be either due to 498 hydrolysis of ATP g S and slow release of thiophosphate or due to a structural defect that prevents the formation 499 of an NTD ‚Äòup‚Äô state in response to Mg 2 + and ATP g S binding . Therefore , a spectrum in the presence of Mg 2 + and 500 AMP - PNP , which features a chemically more stable phosphate linkage , was recorded in addition . Excerpts from 501 the corresponding spectra of point mutants ( F360P , D304N , K251A , N348Q ) are shown in Fig . S5 - 8 . 502 503 504 505 506 507 23 508 Extended Data Fig . 6 Comparison of active sites in ATP vs . ADP . P i states in MD simulations . 509 The structural and dynamical features of arginine finger residues R359 and F360 at the D1 active site were 510 evaluated over the 2 ¬µs MD trajectory of a p97 hexamer with five active sites occupied with ATP and one with 511 ATP cleaved in silico into ADP and P i . Left ordinate : the distances d1 and d2 between R359 - N h 1 / N h 2 and the P 512 atom of the P i ion reflect the side chain conformation of R359 ; right ordinate : c 1 angle of F360 . While all ATP - 513 bound subunits show a stable topology throughout , the ADP . P i - bound subunit undergoes a transition when the P i 514 ion moves between states A and B , coupled to a flip of the F360 side chain . On top , MD snapshots from the 515 respective active sites are shown highlighting R359 and F360 . 516 517 24 518 Extended Data Fig . 7 Conformational changes in the sensor loop . 519 a , The sensor loop extends from the sensor residue N348 of one subunit to the arginine finger of the adjacent 520 subunit . Its secondary structure is more similar between ATP g S and ADP . P i states than between ADP . P i and ADP 521 states , making it the last structural element in D1 to transition from pre - hydrolysis to post - hydrolysis 522 conformation . The transition of the sensor loop is documented by a Ramachandran plot analysis . Residues R359 , 523 F360 as well as N348 , R349 , N351 and S352 undergo dramatic changes in conformation with the progression of 524 ATP - hydrolysis cycle . Residues 349 - 352 in the first half of the loop change little between ATP g S to ADP . P i states , 525 but undergo a turn - to - helix conversion from ADP . P i to ADP state . b , Superposition of the sensor loop in different 526 nucleotide states . c , For residues 350 - 352 , the STRIDE algorithm 34 detects a turn for ATP g S and ADP . P i states 527 and a 3 10 helix for ADP state . Analyses were performed on the following models : ATP g S : 5ftn 1 , ADP . P i state A : 528 this work , ADP : 5ftk 1 . 529 530 531 532 533 25 534 Extended Data Fig . 8 Contributions of active site residues to P i destabilization and release . 535 a , Energy decomposition of MMPBSA calculations identifies residues that destabilize the ADP . P i states A and B 536 the most . Especially state B is destabilized by the repulsion between ADP and P i . The overall binding free energy 537 estimated by MMPBSA calculations considers non - bonded interactions ( Coulombic , van - der - Waals ) between 538 protein and ligand as well as changes in solvation free energy between unbound and bound states . In p97 , the most 539 significant factors are polar solvation energies ( destabilizing ) and electrostatics ( stabilizing ) . Only the electrostatic 540 contributions differ significantly between the calculations for states A , B and R359K mutant . b , Lysine side chains 541 contributed by K251 and K359 symmetrically stabilize the ADP . P i state of the P i - release deficient mutant R359K . 542 c , Side view of the P i dissociation trajectory ( top view in Fig . 5b ) shows the P i ion leaving p97 through the central 543 pore via the top of the hexamer . d , ATPase activities of p97 - ND1L with mutations of R and K residues that contact 544 the P i ion during dissociation ( Fig . 5d ) . Note that the removal of R but not K strongly reduces ATP turnover and 545 that the mutation R ¬Æ K does not sustain ATPase activity . The ATPase activity also cannot be recovered by 546 introducing R at neighbouring sites ( as in K312R - R313A or R313A - E314R ) . 547 548 26 549 Extended Data Fig . 9 Structural effect of P i ions and mimics on apo p97 . 550 a , A concentration of ~ 75 mM inorganic P i ions in solution induces a complete movement of the NTD in apo p97 - 551 ND1L into the ‚Äòdown‚Äô position . Residues V116 , V154 and V87 report on the NTD position . The arrows indicate 552 the shifts of representative methyl correlations from the ‚Äòup‚Äô position ( ATP g S state as reference in single contours ) 553 to ‚Äòdown‚Äô position ( ADP . P i state as reference ) . Mutants P247K , R359A and R362A do not form hexamers in apo 554 state and do not respond to Pi addition ( Fig . S11 ) . Note that fl p97 requires a threefold higher P i concentration to 555 achieve even a partial effect on NTD position . b , Top : Arsenate ( HAsO 42 - ) and sulphate ( SO 42 - ) can mimic 556 phosphate ( HPO 42 - ) at a concentration of ~ 100 mM . Bottom : Comparison of thermochemical radii of these ions 557 as an estimate of their effective size in solution . 35 In the light of our observations , a crystal structure of apo state 558 p97 where the NTD is found in the ' down ' state 36 may be attributed to a sulphate ion trapped between P247 and 559 K251 . 560 27 561 Extended Data Fig . 10 Effects of ATP hydrolysis on protein mobility and structure . 562 a , The RMSF of C Œ± atoms over the 2 ¬µs MD trajectory ( same as Fig . E6 ) quantifies protein mobility at the level 563 of individual residues . The ratio of the RMSF values of the ADP . P i - bound subunits in states A ( left ) and B ( right ) 564 over the average of the five ATP - bound subunits is shown as a heat map on the respective MD snapshots . 565 Increased mobility upon hydrolysis ( red shades ) is observed propagating from the active site . State B is overall 566 less mobile than state A . Regions of interest include : ( 1 ) helix ‚ç∫ 191 - 199 and the NTD - D1 linker ; ( 2 ) helix ‚ç∫ 251 - 262 567 extending from the Walker A motif to the NTD - D1 interface ; ( 3 ) helix ‚ç∫ 407 - 423 to which F360 associates transiently 568 in trans ; ( 4 ) helix ‚ç∫ 374 - 387 running past the nucleotide towards the NTD - D1 interface displays increased mobility 569 in state A only . b , Two side chain rotamers of H384 are uniquely observed for the ADP . P i state . They belong to a 570 larger interaction network between D1 and NTD , which enables the conformational change that locks the NTD 571 into the ‚Äòdown‚Äô position . In comparison to the ATP g S structure , the ADP position turns 7¬∞ in the ADP . P i structure , 572 enabling an interaction between the ribose moiety and H384 . The C - terminus of helix ‚ç∫ 374 - 387 forms an interface 573 with the NTD ( stick representation ) only in the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state , where N387 forms a tight network with residues 574 R155 and R159 . Meanwhile , N387 flips away from this interface when the NTD is in the ' up ' position ( c . f . Video 575 S5 ) . c , The NMR signals of nearby residues are sensitive both to ATP hydrolysis ( ATP ùõæ S vs . ADP . P i ) and to P i 576 release ( ADP . P i vs . ADP ) . The location of the methyl probes is visualized on the ADP .
