Studies have documented 18 catastrophic disparities at critical points throughout the pandemic , but have not yet 19 systematically tracked their severity through time . Using anonymized hospitalization data from 20 March 11 , 2020 to June 1 , 2021 , we estimate the time - varying burden of COVID - 19 by age 21 group and ZIP code in Austin , Texas . During this 15 - month period , we estimate an overall 22 16 . 9 % ( 95 % CrI : 16 . 1 - 17 . 8 % ) infection rate and 34 . 1 % ( 95 % CrI : 32 . 4 - 35 . 8 % ) case reporting 23 rate . Individuals over 65 were less likely to be infected than younger age groups ( 8 . 0 % [ 95 % 24 CrI : 7 . 5 - 8 . 6 % ] vs 18 . 1 % [ 95 % CrI : 17 . 2 - 19 . 2 % ] ) , but more likely to be hospitalized ( 1 , 381 per 25 100 , 000 vs 319 per 100 , 000 ) and have their infections reported ( 51 % [ 95 % CrI : 48 - 55 % ] vs 33 % 26 [ 95 % CrI : 31 - 35 % ] ) . Children under 18 , who make up 20 . 3 % of the local population , accounted 27 for only 5 . 5 % ( 95 % CrI : 3 . 8 - 7 . 7 % ) of all infections between March 1 and May 1 , 2020 compared 28 with 20 . 4 % ( 95 % CrI : 17 . 3 - 23 . 9 % ) between December 1 , 2020 and February 1 , 2021 . We 29 compared ZIP codes ranking in the 75th percentile of vulnerability to those in the 25th 30 percentile , and found that the more vulnerable communities had 2 . 5 ( 95 % CrI : 2 . 0 - 3 . 0 ) times the 31 infection rate and only 70 % ( 95 % CrI : 61 % - 82 % ) the reporting rate compared to the less 32 vulnerable communities . Inequality persisted but declined significantly over the 15 - month study 33 period . For example , the ratio in infection rates between the more and less vulnerable 34 communities declined from 12 . 3 ( 95 % CrI : 8 . 8 - 17 . 1 ) to 4 . 0 ( 95 % CrI : 3 . 0 - 5 . 3 ) to 2 . 7 ( 95 % CrI : 35 2 . 0 - 3 . 6 ) , from April to August to December of 2020 , respectively . Our results suggest that public 36 health efforts to mitigate COVID - 19 disparities were only partially effective and that the CDC’s 37 social vulnerability index may serve as a reliable predictor of risk on a local scale when 38 surveillance data are limited . 39 .

Introduction 40 The WHO estimates that the COVID - 19 pandemic caused nearly 15 million excess deaths 41 worldwide between its emergence in 2019 and the end of 2021 . The burden fell 42 disproportionately on countries in South - East Asia , Europe , and the Americas , with 68 % of the 43 estimated excess deaths occurring in 10 countries containing 35 % of the global population [ 1 ] . 44 In the United States , pandemic burden was initially concentrated around New York City , but 45 spread geographically after the White House issued the Opening Up America Again guidelines 46 in spring of 2020 [ 2 ] . The pandemic disproportionately harmed essential workers and racial and 47 ethnic minority groups [ 3 – 6 ] as well as US counties [ 7 – 10 ] and cities [ 11 – 13 ] with high social 48 vulnerability indices [ 14 ] . 49 50 In response to these glaring disparities , scientists and public health leaders advocated for 51 programs to support marginalized communities , including accessible testing facilities , 52 community support programs to mitigate the socioeconomic , educational and healthcare harms 53 resulting from lockdowns , proactive vaccination and antiviral campaigns , and effective public 54 health communications [ 15 – 21 ] . Some but not all US vaccination campaigns successfully 55 prioritized vulnerable geographic regions [ 22 – 29 ] . 56 57 To prevent , detect , and reduce disparities in infectious disease burden , we need to increase the 58 geographic and temporal resolution of our surveillance efforts , while reducing biases . Published 59 estimates of COVID - 19 burden in underserved populations are often derived directly from 60 reported case or death counts , without correcting for ascertainment biases or disentangling risks 61 of infection from risks of severe outcomes [ 7 – 9 , 30 – 40 ] . When available , both serological [ 41 , 42 ] 62 and hospitalization data [ 43 ] can be used to estimate reporting rates . Several studies have 63 highlighted the disproportionate burden of COVID - 19 infections within cities [ 44 , 45 ] , but only at 64 single time points during the pandemic . 65 66 Here , we estimate the changing burden of COVID - 19 at a local scale within a large US city 67 throughout the first 15 months of the pandemic . Using ZIP - code and age - stratified 68 hospitalization data , we track daily disparities in infection rates , hospitalization rates , and case 69 reporting rates . As the SARS - CoV - 2 virus continues to evolve along with our arsenal of medical 70 and behavioral interventions , this method can help to ensure the reliability and equity of local 71 risk assessments [ 46 ] . 72 Methods 73 We estimate the daily age - stratified numbers of infections for each of the 46 ZIP codes in 74 Austin , Texas from hospital linelist data provided by the three major local healthcare systems to 75 Austin Public Health [ 47 ] . As described below , we first estimate age - specific infection 76 hospitalization rates ( IHRs ) from state - wide COVID - 19 hospitalization data and SARS - CoV - 2 77 seroprevalence data and then use the IHR estimates to infer time series of infections by age 78 group and ZIP code using a deconvolution method similar to ref . [ 44 ] . 79 . CC - BY - NC 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

Specifically , we estimate IHR for age group , , across the state of Texas ( ) as : 83 84 85 where contains all dates between ( July 29 , 2020 ) and ( May 27 , 2021 ) , 86 corresponds to all reported hospitalizations in age group on day to account for the delay 87 between infection and hospitalization [ 50 , 51 ] , and corresponds to the CDC’s estimated 88 infections for Texas between the two dates [ 52 ] estimated as : 89 90 91 92 where 93 and corresponds to the variance of estimated infections at time [ 52 ] . We aggregated hospital 94 admission data , which are stratified into 0 - 17 , 18 - 19 , 20 - 29 , 30 - 39 , 40 - 49 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 , 70 - 79 , 95 and 80 + year age groups , to match the stratification of the seroprevalence data ( 0 - 17 , 18 - 49 , 96 50 - 64 , and 65 + years ) . For bins that do not align , we divided admissions evenly across years 97 within a bin . 98 ZIP - and age - specific infection hospitalization rates ( IHRs ) 99 Infection hospitalization rates depend on the underlying demographic makeup of a population 100 [ 53 ] . To estimate age - and ZIP - specific IHRs from the statewide averages estimated above , we 101 assumed that risk differences between ZIP codes could be captured by the proportion of the 102 population estimated to be at high risk for severe COVID - 19 . We used a published methodology 103 to estimate the proportion of the population at high risk for severe COVID - 19 outcomes using 104 data available from CDC’s PLACES for each ZIP code and the state on average [ 5 , 54 – 56 ] . We 105 converted the statewide age - specific IHRs to ZIP - specific ones as : 106 107 108 109 where is the infection hospitalization rate for age group , , and ZIP code , is the 110 estimated age and ZIP code proportion of the population at high risk , and and 111 are the statewide estimated age - specific IHRs for those at high and low risk to severe COVID - 112 19 outcomes respectively . We assume a fixed hospitalization risk ratio between low and high 113 risk individuals , , where is the age - specific hospitalization risk ratio 114 estimated in [ 57 ] . For example , high risk individuals in the 20 - 24 and 75 + age groups are 115 estimated to have 6 . 5 and 2 . 2 times the hospitalization risk respectively compared with low risk 116 individuals in the same age group ( Table S1 ) . We then estimate and as : 117 118 ay d y .

We then estimate across Travis County using age - and ZIP - specific estimates 124 for the proportion of the population at high risk for COVID - 19 . Confidence intervals for are 125 derived by propagating the estimated uncertainty from the age - specific statewide IHRs . 126 Age - and ZIP code - specific infection estimates 127 The posterior distribution for infections ( ) in a specific age group ( ) and ZIP code ( ) was 128 estimated as : 129 130 131 132 where indicates the total infection count , is the reported hospital admissions , and 133 is the age - and ZIP - specific IHR . Hospitalizations were assumed to be a binomial sample of the 134 total infections governed by , is assumed to follow a beta distribution , and follows a 135 uniform discrete prior between the age - and ZIP - specific hospitalization count and 136 population : 137 138 139 140 141 142 We estimate the parameters for the informative prior beta distribution , and , using the 143 ZIP and age - specific IHR estimates estimated from seroprevalence data in the previous section . 144 Specifically we use the equation : 145 146 147 148 and identify the value of that minimizes the difference between and the 2 . 5th 149 percentile of the resulting beta distribution , . In essence , we estimate the shape 150 parameters of a beta distribution that match the mean and lower bound estimate of the IHR . We 151 used JAGS to sample 1 , 000 draws from across four chains thinning every two 152 samples and with a 200 sample burn - in period [ 58 ] . Throughout the paper we summarize the 153 posterior distributions using their mean and 95 % credible intervals . 154 155 We created a distribution of the time - series of infections from the 1 , 000 samples of 156 through the hospital admission timing and the delay distribution between 157 e n . e o .

Specifically , we fit a gamma distribution to the combined 158 distribution derived from the time to symptom onset estimated in [ 50 ] and the time between 159 symptom onset and hospital admission estimated in [ 51 ] . The combined distribution is estimated 160 as . For each infection in , we draw a hospitalization timing 161 from , the number of hospitalizations in an age - and ZIP code group on day and assign 162 an infection time from the estimated gamma distribution similar to the deconvolution method 163 used in [ 44 ] without necessitating a smoothing function for the infection time - series . For age and 164 ZIP code groups that had estimated infections but zero reported hospitalizations , we drew the 165 infection timing from the full hospitalization time - series , , where for 166 day , , summed across all age groups and ZIP codes . 167 Reporting rate estimates 168 We assumed reported cases are distributed binomially as given by 169 170 171 172 where describes the specific subgroup of interest ( age group , , and / or ZIP code , ) for a 173 specified time period , is the estimated infections , and is the estimated reporting rate . 174 Assuming a uniform beta prior distribution on the reporting rate , the posterior for can be 175 calculated as : 176 177 178 179 We estimated overall and subgroup reporting rates for the full study period through June 1 , 180 2021 using cumulative age - specific case counts for Travis County [ 59 ] as well as ZIP code 181 specific counts provided by Austin Public Health ( APH ) [ 60 ] . Separately , we estimated the age - 182 and ZIP - specific reporting rates from a subset of testing data provided to us directly from Austin 183 Public Health , which included 60 % of reported cases in Travis County during the time period . 184 Similar to the seroprevalence analysis , we lagged reported cases by 11 days to account for 185 infection reporting delays [ 61 , 62 ] . 186 Infection estimate validation 187 To estimate how well our infection time - series approximate true infection rates in Travis county , 188 we compare them to seroprevalence data for Texas estimated by the CDC [ 52 ] Regions in 189 Texas faced different infection rates , so we adjusted Texas statewide seroprevalence estimates 190 to Travis County as : 191 192 193 194 ed nd in , s .

SVI values are given at the level of census 202 tract as percentile ranks ( range 0 . 0 - 1 . 0 ) within each state based on the 2014 - 2018 5 - year ACS . 203 For example , an SVI of 0 . 6 indicates that a census tract is more vulnerable than 60 % of other 204 census tracts in the state . Following [ 64 ] , we aggregated SVI to ZIP codes using weighted 205 averages based on the percent of residential addresses in a ZIP code that fall in each census 206 tract [ 65 ] . 207 208 We estimated the impact of SVI on infection and reporting rates using a mixed effect poisson 209 regression model using the lme4 R package [ 66 ] . For estimating the impact of SVI on infection 210 rates the model can be described as : 211 212 213 214 Where is the infection estimate sample estimated for ZIP code , , is the ZIP codes’ 215 SVI , is the ZIP code level random effect , is the fixed effect of SVI on infections , and is 216 an intercept term . We use the ZIP code population as an offset in the model to standardize 217 infection rates . For estimating the impact of SVI on reporting rates the model can be described 218 as : 219 220 221 222 where is the reported case count for ZIP code , , is the ZIP codes’s SVI , is the ZIP 223 code level random effect , is the fixed effect of SVI on cases , and is an intercept . We use 224 the 1 , 000 ZIP code infection estimate samples as an offset in the model to standardize reporting 225 rates . For the age and ZIP code - stratified analysis we also include an interaction term between 226 age and SVI , so the equations become : 227 228 229 230 231 where is the infection estimate sample in age group , for ZIP code , , is the 232 reported cases in age group , for ZIP code , , and is the SVI regression coefficient for age 233 group , . For the infection and reporting rate models we use the age - and ZIP - population and 234 infection estimates as an offset respectively . 235 . s’ ng .

Because there are no ZIP codes 238 with a value of 0 or 1 for SVI in our sample , we report the relative infection and reporting rates 239 between ZIP codes in the 25th and 75th percentile in Travis County throughout the manuscript . 240 Results 241 We analyzed spatial COVID - 19 burdens in Austin , Texas using hospital admission data from 242 March 11 , 2020 to June 1 , 2021 . This period preceded the emergence of the Delta variant and 243 included a small wave in April 2020 , followed by larger waves in the summer and winter ( Figure 244 1A ) . As of June 1 , 2021 , there were 83 , 722 reported cases , 6 , 474 hospitalized patients , and 245 1 , 024 deaths of COVID - 19 in Travis County , which has 1 . 3 million residents , covering 57 % of 246 the Austin metropolitan area population . We estimate that 16 . 9 % ( 95 % CrI : 16 . 1 - 17 . 8 % ) of the 247 population were infected in this time period and 34 . 1 % ( 95 % CrI : 32 . 4 - 35 . 8 % ) of all infections 248 were reported . These estimates are consistent with the CDC’s official seroprevalence estimates 249 ( Figure 1B ) . 250 Statewide , we estimate that one in 435 ( 95 % CI : 244 - 625 ) infections in individuals aged 0 - 17 251 years and one in 4 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 0 - 6 . 8 ) infections in individuals over age 65 led to hospitalization 252 ( Table 1 ) . This is consistent with published estimates from China [ 67 ] and France [ 43 ] ( Figure 253 S2 ) . In Travis County , children aged 0 - 17 experienced the lowest hospitalization rate , with 50 . 3 254 hospital admissions per 100 , 000 , and adults over age 65 experienced the highest 255 hospitalization rate of 1 , 381 per 100 , 000 ( Figure 2A ) . In contrast , reported cases were relatively 256 similar across age groups , ranging from 3 , 793 per 100 , 000 in children to 7 , 159 per 100 , 000 in 257 young adults ( Figure 2B ) . 258 Table 1 : SARS - CoV - 2 infection hospitalization rate ( IHR ) across Texas estimated from 259 statewide seroprevalence and hospitalization data from July 29 , 2020 through May 27 , 260 2021 . 261 Age group Number of COVID - 19 hospital admissions [ 48 ] Estimated infections based on seroprevalence data ( 95 % CI ) [ 49 , 52 ] Estimated IHR ( 95 % CI ) 0 - 17 4 , 868 2 , 076 , 780 ( 1 , 183 , 462 - 2 , 970 , 098 ) 0 . 23 % ( 0 . 16 % - 0 . 41 % ) 18 - 49 67 , 708 3 , 784 , 332 ( 2 , 842 , 976 - 4 , 725 , 687 ) 1 . 79 % ( 1 . 43 % - 2 . 38 % ) 50 - 64 58 , 375 1 , 084 , 993 ( 708 , 561 - 1 , 461 , 425 ) 5 . 38 % ( 3 . 99 % - 8 . 24 % ) 65 + 100 , 671 495 , 141 ( 301 , 983 - 688 , 299 ) 20 . 33 % ( 14 . 63 % - 33 . 34 % ) By June 1 , 2021 , we estimate that 19 . 3 % ( 95 % CrI : 18 . 1 - 20 . 6 % ) of 18 - 49 year olds were 262 infected , while only 8 . 0 % ( 95 % CrI : 7 . 5 - 8 . 6 % ) of individuals over age 65 were infected ( Figure 263 g e s n ly .

The estimated percent of cases reported increases with age , ranging from 23 . 4 % ( 95 % CrI : 264 20 . 1 - 27 . 3 % ) in 0 - 17 year olds to 51 . 3 % ( 95 % CrI : 47 . 7 - 54 . 9 % ) in over 65 year olds ( Figure 2D ) . 265 266 267 Figure 1 : COVID - 19 hospital admissions and estimated cumulative infections for Travis 268 County ( Austin , TX ) from March 1 , 2020 to June 1 , 2021 . ( A ) Daily reported COVID - 19 269 hospital admissions per 1 million residents [ 68 ] . ( B ) Estimated cumulative infections with 95 % 270 credible intervals ( black line and gray ribbon ) compared to prior seroprevalence - based 271 estimates ( red points and error bars ) [ 69 ] . 272 273 All age groups experienced two large waves during the study period , though the summer 2020 274 was relatively mild for children ( Figure 2E ) . Relative infection rates across age groups evened 275 out over time ( Figure 2F ) . For example , children , who account for 20 . 3 % of the Travis county 276 population , constituted 5 . 5 % ( 95 % CrI : 3 . 8 - 7 . 7 % ) of all infections between March 1 , 2020 and 277 May 1 , 2020 and 20 . 4 % ( 95 % CrI : 17 . 3 - 23 . 9 % ) of all infections between December 1 , 2020 and 278 February 1 , 2021 . The proportion of infections occurring in 18 - 49 year olds , who make up 51 . 2 % 279 of the population , dropped from 69 . 1 % ( 95 % CrI : 66 . 5 - 71 . 6 % ) during the spring 2020 period to 280 51 . 3 % ( 95 % CrI : 48 . 4 - 54 . 0 % ) during the winter 2020 - 2021 wave ( Figure 2F and S3 ) . Reported 281 case and hospitalization counts do not clearly exhibit this reversal in age - specific risks ( Figure 282 S4 and S5 ) . 283 284 285 286 rI : d % .

Bars indicate the fraction of all infections during the time period in each Age 298 group , with the error bars indicating the 95 % credible intervals . The horizontal colored lines in 299 panel F indicate the proportion of the Travis county population in the specified age group . 300 301 Estimated COVID - 19 burden varies significantly across ZIP codes within Travis County , with 302 Interstate 35 roughly partitioning the county into high risk ZIP codes in the East and low risk ZIP 303 codes in the West ( Figure 3A and 3B ) . High COVID - 19 risk visibly aligns with high social 304 vulnerability , as measured by ZIP - code level SVI ( Figure 3C ) . Our estimates for ZIP - code level 305 infection hospitalization rates exhibit the opposite geographic trend ( Figure 3D ) from the 306 absolute hospitalization rates ( Figure S6 ) . We estimate that downtown Austin ( 78701 ) had the 307 highest infection rate and lowest reporting rate of any ZIP code , with an estimated 39 . 2 % ( 95 % 308 CrI : 29 . 6 - 50 . 2 % ) of the ZIP code infected and only 18 % ( 95 % CrI : 14 - 23 % ) of infections 309 reported ( Figure 3E - 3F ) . In contrast , a Southwest Austin ZIP code ( 78739 ) had the lowest 310 estimated infection rate of 4 . 8 % ( 95 % CrI : 2 . 6 - 8 . 5 % ) , and a West Austin ZIP code ( 78732 ) had 311 the highest reporting rate of 69 % ( 95 % CrI : 39 - 97 % ) .

We 323 compare the relative risks for individuals living in a ZIP code at Travis County’s 25th ( SVI = 0 . 12 ) 324 and 75th ( SVI = 0 . 5 ) percentile by SVI , where higher SVI indicates higher social vulnerability . 325 Controlling for random ZIP code - level effects , we estimate that ZIP codes in the 75th SVI 326 percentile experienced 2 . 5 ( 95 % CrI : 2 . 0 - 3 . 0 ) times the infection rate of those in the 25th 327 percentile . Similar trends are observed for each age group , with all relationships estimated to be 328 statistically significant ( Figure S10 , Table S2 ) .

For Travis county , we find that the subset of case data from APH 331 provides a reasonable approximation but hospitalization data tends to inflate the estimated 332 disparities ( Table S2 ) . We aggregate the estimated number of infections occurring in each ZIP 333 code into four - week periods from March 1 , 2020 to June 1 , 2021 , and measure the relationship 334 between SVI and the relative infection risk during this period . Significant disparity ( i . e . , a relative 335 risk greater than one ) persisted throughout the period and was highest during the first three 336 months of the pandemic ( Figure 4B ) . In April 2020 , individuals living in the 75th SVI percentile 337 ZIP code had an expected 12 . 3 ( 95 % CrI : 8 . 8 - 17 . 1 ) times greater infection risk than those living 338 in the 25th percentile SVI ZIP code . This ratio declined to 4 . 0 ( 95 % CrI : 3 . 0 - 5 . 3 ) in August 2020 339 and to 2 . 7 ( 95 % CrI : 2 . 0 - 3 . 6 ) in December 2020 . 340 COVID - 19 case reporting rates are negatively correlated with social vulnerability . We estimate 341 that infections occurring in the 75th SVI percentile ZIP code were only 70 % ( 95 % CrI : 61 % - 342 82 % ) as likely to have been reported than those occurring in the 25th SVI percentile ZIP code . 343 We further stratified by age group using a small sample of age - specific case data reported by 344 the Austin Public Health community testing programs , which targeted vulnerable populations in 345 East Austin ( Figure S12 ) [ 70 ] . We found that the negative correlation between SVI and case 346 reporting rates held for all age groups except those over 65 years , perhaps because of Austin’s 347 efforts to improve testing access for high risk individuals ( Figure S11 , Table S2 ) . Throughout the 348 study period , the estimated ratio in reporting rates between the 75th and 25th SVI percentile ZIP 349 codes fluctuated , often dropping to levels significantly less than one ( Figure 4D ) . 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 .

Infection and reporting rates correlate with social vulnerability in Travis County 358 from March 1 , 2020 to June 1 , 2021 .

The blue line and ribbon indicate the 360 mean and 95 % prediction interval from the fitted Poisson mixed - effects model . ( B ) Using the 361 fitted model , we compare the expected infection rates among more and less vulnerable ZIP 362 codes ( specifically , ZIP codes at the 75th and 25th percentiles in the SVI distribution , 363 respectively ) . The points indicate the expected ratio between these two values calculated using 364 the estimated SVI regression coefficient from the 4 - week time period ; error bars indicate 95 % 365 CI’s . ( C ) Across the 46 ZIP codes , SVI is a significant predictor of estimated case reporting 366 rates ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The blue line and ribbon indicate the mean and 95 % prediction interval from 367 the fitted Poisson mixed - effects model . ( D ) Four week estimate for the inequality relationship 368 between SVI and infection reporting rates across the 46 ZIP codes . Points and error bars show 369 the mean and 95 % CI for the relative reporting rate of individuals living in ZIP codes in the 75th 370 SVI percentile compared with those living in the 25th SVI percentile . The red , horizontal dashed 371 lines in B and D indicate if there were equitable infection risks or reporting rates across the 75th 372 and 25th SVI percentile ZIP codes in the four week period . We overlay hospital admission time - 373 series in B and D to showcase how inequality estimates compare with the progression of the 374 local epidemic . For the final period ( purple points and error bars ) , we removed the 10 % of ZIP 375 codes reporting zero infections to stabilize our regression estimates . 376 Discussion 377 In the US , the first wave of the COVID - 19 pandemic disproportionately harmed essential 378 workers [ 5 , 6 ] , residents of long - term care facilities [ 71 ] , racial and ethnic minority populations 379 [ 72 ] , and socially vulnerable neighborhoods within cities [ 31 , 44 , 73 , 74 ] . Public health agencies 380 and government officials have tried to address these disparities through targeted testing , 381 vaccination , distribution of personal protective equipment , information campaigns , and paid sick 382 leave [ 15 – 19 ] .

This is 388 consistent with prior estimates [ 53 , 75 – 77 ] and may be attributable to early school closures , strict 389 compliance with social distancing measures [ 78 ] , or the emergence of variants that more 390 efficiently infect children [ 79 , 80 ] . We also find that individuals over age 65 generally had the 391 lowest risks of infection , despite suffering the highest per capita hospitalization rate , which may 392 stem from heightened precautionary behavior and other protective measures such as COVID - 19 393 screening in long - term care facilities [ 81 ] . Our age - stratified estimates of cumulative SARS - CoV - 394 2 incidence are generally consistent with those derived from seroprevalence data [ 49 ] . 395 Reporting rates were lowest in children and highest in older adults ( Figure 2 ) , which may stem 396 from the positive correlation between age and symptom severity [ 75 ] . 397 Historically marginalized populations in the “Eastern Crescent” of Austin were 398 disproportionately harmed throughout the first year of the pandemic [ 82 , 83 ] , mirroring disparities 399 reported for Santiago , Chile and New York City [ 44 , 45 , 73 ] . After controlling for the higher 400 prevalence of underlying risk factors in more vulnerable communities , we find that the ZIP codes 401 ranking in the 75th percentile of social vulnerability had a more than twofold higher infection rate 402 and a roughly 70 % the case reporting rate than those ranking in the 25th percentile . Our 403 estimates for inequity in infection risk are significantly lower than those from raw hospitalization 404 rates , which do not account for variation in the prevalence of comorbidities . The estimated ratio 405 in infection risk between more and less vulnerable regions decreased significantly during the 406 first four months of the pandemic , perhaps because of local efforts to increase access to SARS - 407 CoV - 2 testing , isolation facilities , critical health information , and eventually vaccines [ 84 ] . The 408 apparent decrease in disparity may also stem from higher infection rates in vulnerable 409 populations leading to a more rapid buildup of immunity or relatively higher infection rates in 410 less vulnerable areas during later time periods [ 85 , 86 ] . As of June of 2021 , however , there 411 remained a significant gap in COVID - 19 risks and burden which informed targeted efforts by 412 Austin Public Health to increase access to tests , vaccines , information and COVID - 19 413 healthcare . 414 We note several assumptions of analysis . First , the hospital admission data are limited 415 by the accuracy of patient ZIP codes . Fewer than 1 % of patients had unknown addresses . 416 However , the missing data may correspond to vulnerable subgroups , such as people 417 experiencing homelessness or undocumented residents , and thus obscure critical geographic or 418 socioeconomic hotspots in our analysis . Second , we estimated each age - and ZIP - specific 419 group independently rather than combining information across groups . This increases the 420 uncertainty of our estimates but avoids the challenge of incorporating the changing contact and 421 mobility patterns within the city throughout the pandemic [ 87 – 89 ] . Third , although we conducted 422 analyses at a higher spatial resolution than most prior studies of COVID - 19 burden , disparities 423 in risk often occur at even more local scale [ 90 ] . Achieving COVID - 19 health equity will require 424 more granular surveillance and risk mitigation approaches . Finally , since we restricted our 425 analysis to the first year of the pandemic , prior to the emergence of the Delta variant , we made 426 the simplifying assumption that the infection hospitalization rates remained constant .

Our study introduces a framework for tracking infection 432 and reporting rates on a granular scale using hospitalization data and provides evidence that 433 the CDC’s social vulnerability index ( SVI ) is a strong predictor of risk that can inform targeted 434 interventions . 435 436 437 438 439 Supplemental Information 440 Table S1 : Relative hospitalization rates for high risk individuals compared with low risk 441 individuals from [ 57 ] . 442 Age group Relative hospitalization risk for high risk individuals 0 - 0 . 5y 6 . 03 0 . 5 - 4y 6 . 03 5 - 9y 6 . 03 10 - 14y 6 . 48 15 - 19y 6 . 48 20 - 24y 6 . 48 25 - 29y 6 . 48 30 - 34y 5 . 5 35 - 39y 5 . 5 40 - 44y 4 . 625 45 - 49y 4 . 625 50 - 54y 3 . 78 55 - 59y 3 . 78 60 - 64y 3 . 24 65 - 69y 3 . 24 70 - 74y 2 . 32 75y + 2 . 19 .
