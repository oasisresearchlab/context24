It plays a key role in actin dynamics by promoting disassembly and assembly of actin ﬁ laments . Upon its binding , co ﬁ lin has been shown to bridge two adjacent protomers in ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) and promote the displacement and disordering of subdomain 2 of actin . Here , we present evidence for co ﬁ lin promoting a new structural change in the actin ﬁ lament , as detected via a switch in cross - linking sites . Benzophenone - 4 - maleimide , which normally forms intramolecular cross - linking in F - actin , cross - links F - actin intermolecularly upon co ﬁ lin binding . We mapped the cross - linking sites and found that in the absence of co ﬁ lin intramolecular cross - linking occurred between residues Cys374 and Asp11 . In contrast , co ﬁ lin shifts the cross - linking by this reagent to intermolecular , between residue Cys374 , located within subdomain 1 of the upper protomer , and Met44 , located in subdomain 2 of the lower protomer . The intermolecular cross - linking of F - actin slows the rate of co ﬁ lin dissociation from the ﬁ laments and decreases the e ﬀ ect of ionic strength on co ﬁ lin − actin binding . These results are consistent with a signi ﬁ cant role of ﬁ lament ﬂ exibility in co ﬁ lin − actin interactions . R apid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for many cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms including cell motility , di ﬀ erentiation , and division . Proteins belonging to the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / co ﬁ lin family play a key role in regulating actin dynamics . 1 As the name implies , ADF / co ﬁ lin is able to enhance actin treadmilling by binding to ADP - actin with high a ﬃ nity and promoting disassembly of actin ﬁ laments ( F - actin ) from the pointed end . Co ﬁ lin binds to F - actin , promoting its severing and thus creating more ends for depolymerization or polymerization . 2 , 3 Because co ﬁ lin plays a complex role in actin dynamics and is a ubiquitous protein , it is important to obtain the best possible structural characterization of co ﬁ lin ’ s interaction with F - actin . Prior to the most recent ∼ 9 Å resolution model of co ﬁ lin bound to F - actin , 4 several groups have mapped the binding sites of co ﬁ lin on both G - and F - actin via mutagenesis , ﬂ uorescence probing , and chemical cross - linking in an e ﬀ ort to understand co ﬁ lin ’ s functions . 5 − 9 Grintsevich et al . 5 concluded that co ﬁ lin binds to the hydrophobic cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 on G - actin , as suggested by previous models . 10 , 11 The atomic structure of the C - terminal ADF homology domain of twin ﬁ lin in complex with G - actin also supports binding between subdomains 1 and 3 of G - actin . The ADF homology domain inserts an α - helix into the hydrophobic cleft on actin in a similar manner to gelsolin and WH2 domain proteins . 12 The structure of co ﬁ lin − G - actin provides insight into the mechanism for ADF depolymerization of actin through the weakening of intra ﬁ lament interactions . Electron microscopy ( EM ) reconstructions , chemical cross - linking , and molecular dynamic ( MD ) simulations also lead to a model of the co ﬁ lin / F - actin complex . 10 , 13 − 16 Galkin et al . 4 showed that co ﬁ lin binding displaces substantially the subdomain 2 of actin and results in its disordering , thus disrupting interprotomer contacts . The disordering of subdomain 2 caused by co ﬁ lin binding leads to a 4 - fold increase in F - actin ﬂ exibility . 17 As for ﬁ lament stability , the impact of disrupting interprotomer contacts is o ﬀ set to a great extent by co ﬁ lin ’ s binding to two adjacent longitudinal actin protomers . Here , we provide experimental evidence derived from actin cross - linking by benzophenone - 4 - maleimide ( BPM ) for two types of structural transitions in actin : one associated with actin polymerization into ﬁ laments and the other coupled to co ﬁ lin binding to F - actin . Although cross - linking captures changes that normally re ﬂ ect contact - induced modi ﬁ cation of speci ﬁ c sites , it is believed that actin polymerization prompts intramolecular changes as well . Previous results from Tao et al . 18 showed little or no cross - linking in G - actin after Cys374 labeling with BPM . However , intramolecular BPM cross - linking was detected after G - actin polymerization into F - actin . We con ﬁ rm here this observation and map the intramolecular cross - link in F - actin to Cys374 and Asp11 . Binding of co ﬁ lin to F - actin replaces this intramolecular cross - link with an intermolecular cross - link from Cys374 to Received : June 6 , 2013 Revised : July 14 , 2013 Published : July 17 , 2013 Article pubs . acs . org / biochemistry © 2013 American Chemical Society 5503 dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / bi400715z | Biochemistry 2013 , 52 , 5503 − 5509 Met44 . We also report di ﬀ erences in dissociation of co ﬁ lin from cross - linked and un - cross - linked F - actin indicative of the need for ﬁ lament ﬂ exibility in co ﬁ lin dissociation . Co ﬁ lin - induced conformational changes may help elucidate the local and global changes that occur in F - actin and destabilize certain interprotomer contacts . ■ MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials . Benzophenone - 4 - maleimide and acrylodan were obtained from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . N - ( 4 - Azido - 2 - nitrophenyl ) putrescine ( ANP ) was synthesized as described . 19 Milli - Q - ﬁ ltered water ( Millipore ) and analytical grade reagents were used in all experiments . Protein Puri ﬁ cation and Labeling . Actin was puri ﬁ ed from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously . 20 Recombinant S . cerevisiae wild type co ﬁ lin and co ﬁ lin - Cys1 mutant ( C1 / C62S ) in pBAT4 vector were expressed and puri ﬁ ed as described 5 with slight modi ﬁ cations . Cys1 on co ﬁ lin mutant was labeled with acrylodan by ﬁ rst passing the protein through a Zeba Desalt Spin Column ( Pierce ) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 . Co ﬁ lin was labeled at 1 mg / mL with a 3 times molar excess of acrylodan and incubated on ice for 2 h . The reaction was stopped with 1 mM DTT , and the protein was dialyzed overnight in 5 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 and 1 mM DTT to remove excess label . Labeling e ﬃ ciency was characterized by using an adjusted extinction coe ﬃ cient ( determined as before , 21 with slight modi ﬁ cations ) . The absorbance of acrylodan was measured ﬁ rst in methanol ( ε = 20 000 M − 1 cm − 1 , λ max = 391 nm ) ( Molecular Probes , The Handbook ) and then under denaturing conditions , with 6 M guanidine - HCl ( λ max = 411 nm ) . The absorbance ratio [ A max ( methanol ) / A max ( Gu - HCl ) = 1 . 5 ] was used to correct the extinction coe ﬃ cient determined in methanol for denaturing conditions ( 20 000 M − 1 cm − 1 / 1 . 5 = 13 333 M − 1 cm − 1 ) . Co ﬁ lin mutant concentration was measured by the Bradford assay using wild - type co ﬁ lin as a standard . ANP and BPM Cross - Linking . ANP cross - linking was performed as described previously . 22 BPM cross - linking was executed as described previously 18 with a few modi ﬁ cations . DTT was removed from G - actin on a PD - 10 column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with G - bu ﬀ er ( 5 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 4 mM ATP ) . BPM and actin ( at 2 : 1 molar ratio ) were incubated overnight at 4 ° C . Labeled G - actin was passed through a PD - 10 column equilibrated with G - bu ﬀ er ( 5 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) to remove excess label . Labeled actin was polymerized with 2 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM KCl for 30 min at room temperature . Co ﬁ lin - Cys1 mutant was passed through Zeba Desalt Spin Columns equilibrated with G - bu ﬀ er . Labeled actin was incubated with and without DTT - free co ﬁ lin and cross - linked under UV light ( 365 nm ) for up to 90 min . The reaction was stopped with DTT . Electron Microscopy . BPM - F - actin was cross - linked in the presence of co ﬁ lin at a 1 : 3 mole ratio to actin . Cross - linked F - actin was incubated with 1 . 0 M KCl for 20 min and then pelleted in an OPTIMA - TLX120 ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulters ) at 350000 g for 20 min . Cross - linked F - actin was depolymerized by dialysis vs G - actin bu ﬀ er . BPM - cross - linked dimers were further puri ﬁ ed on a SuperdexS200 16 / 60 cm gel ﬁ ltration column ( GE Healthcare ) . For actin ﬁ lament visualization , all samples were diluted to 2 μ M in F - bu ﬀ er ( 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) and deposited on 400 - mesh carbon - coated copper grids coated with Formvar ﬁ lm ( Ted Pella Inc . , Redding , CA ) . Samples were allowed to adsorb for 60 s and then negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate ( w / v ) for 45 s . Grids were observed with a JEM - 1200EX ( JEOL ) electron microscope operated at 80 kV and magni ﬁ cation in the 80000 − 100000 × range . The images were analyzed using ImageJ software . Mass Spectrometry . Cross - linked F - actin was depolymer - ized in G - bu ﬀ er ( pH 8 . 0 ) . An equimolar amount of Kabiramide C was added to actin prior to its puri ﬁ cation on a SuperdexS200 16 / 60 cm gel ﬁ ltration column ( GE Healthcare ) . Cross - linked actin ( 1 mg / mL ) was reduced with 10 mM DTT at 60 ° C for 45 min and alkylated with 24 mM iodoacetamide at 45 ° C for 1 h . Cross - linked actin was digested with Lys - C and then with trypsin at a 1 : 50 enzyme : substrate ratio in 300 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The ﬁ rst digest was incubated at 37 ° C for 24 h and then for another 24 h after addition of trypsin . Online peptide sequencing was accom - plished by liquid chromatography − tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) with a QSTAR XL quadrupole time - of - ﬂ ight ( QqTOF ) mass spectrometer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . The nano - LC was equipped with an LC Packings PepMap C18 precolumn ( 300 μ m × 5 mm ) and an LC Packings PepMap analytical reversed - phase C18 column ( 75 μ m × 150 mm ) . The eluents used for the LC were ( A ) 5 % acetonitrile ( ACN ) / water containing 0 . 1 % formic acid ( FA ) and 0 . 01 % tri ﬂ uoroacetic acid ( TFA ) and ( B ) 95 % ACN / water acid containing 0 . 1 % FA and 0 . 01 % TFA . The ﬂ ow rate was 200 nL / min , and the following gradient was used : 5 % B to 35 % B in 15 min , then 35 % B to 80 % B in 4 min , and then maintained at 80 % B for 9 min . The column was re - equilibrated with 5 % B for 14 min before the next run . For online LC - MS / MS analyses , a New Objective ( Woburn , MA ) Pico Tip ( i . d . 8 μ m ) was used for electrospraying with the voltage set at 2 kV . The MS / MS fragmentation spectrum of cross - linked peptides was analyzed using the MS2Assign Automatic Structure Assignment Program ( ASAP ) 23 and veri ﬁ ed manually . Cosedimentation Assays . BPM - F - actin was cross - linked in the presence of co ﬁ lin at a 1 : 1 mole ratio to actin . ANP - cross - linked F - actin , Cys374 - Asp11 - cross - linked F - actin , and un - cross - linked F - actin were also mixed with equimolar amounts of co ﬁ lin . These complexes were incubated with various concentrations of KCl for 20 min and then pelleted in an OPTIMA - TLX120 ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulters ) at 350000 g for 20 min . The pellet and supernatant were separated and run on SDS - PAGE for analysis . ImageJ software was used to quantify the Coomassie - stained bands on the gel . Analysis of Binding . Transient kinetic measurements were made at 25 ( ± 0 . 1 ) ° C with an Applied Photophysics ( Surrey , U . K . ) SX . 18MV stopped - ﬂ ow apparatus . The excitation wavelength was set to 390 nm , and the emission was monitored at 90 ° through a 435 nm long - pass colored glass ﬁ lter . Time courses of noncontiguous binding were measured by mixing acrylodan - labeled co ﬁ lin ( 1 − 5 μ M ) with 10 μ M of actin ﬁ laments in F - bu ﬀ er ( pH 7 . 0 ) . Time courses of co ﬁ lin dissociation were measured by mixing an equilibrated mixture of acrylodan - labeled co ﬁ lin and actin ﬁ laments ( 5 μ M ) with 50 μ M unlabeled co ﬁ lin . The indicated concentrations are ﬁ nal concentrations after mixing . Time courses of ﬂ uorescence change were ﬁ tted to single - exponential expressions by nonlinear least - squares ﬁ tting using software provided with the instrument . Standard errors in the ﬁ ts are reported . Dissociation rates of co ﬁ lin from cross - linked actins were measured with an Alphascan ﬂ uorimeter ( Photon Technology Biochemistry Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / bi400715z | Biochemistry 2013 , 52 , 5503 − 5509 5504 International ) . Excitation wavelength was set to 390 nm , and the emission was detected at 505 nm . Conditions were the same as in the control above . Fluorescence changes were ﬁ tted to single - exponential expressions using SigmaPlot ( Systat Software Inc . , San Jose , CA ) . ■ RESULTS Actin Cross - Linking by BPM Changes in the Presence of Co ﬁ lin . Previous results from Tao et al . 18 showed site - speci ﬁ c photo - cross - linking of F - actin with benzophenone - 4 - maleimide ( BPM ) . In the presence of BPM , G - actin displays no or only slight intramolecular cross - linking . This is not changed by the binding of co ﬁ lin to G - actin ( data not shown ) . In contrast to that , BPM forms mainly intramolecular and some minor intermolecular cross - linkings upon photoactivation in F - actin . The maleimide moiety on BPM reacts e ﬃ ciently with Cys374 on actin while its benzophenone ( BP ) moiety photoreacts with amino acids nonselectively but with high yield . We thus can monitor the extent and change in F - actin cross - linking by BPM upon binding of various actin binding proteins . Skeletal F - actin was labeled with BPM and then combined with an equimolar concentration of yeast co ﬁ lin . Upon BP photoactivation , F - actin alone ( control ) formed mainly intra - molecular cross - links . In contrast , similar photoactivation of labeled F - actin in the presence of co ﬁ lin produced extensive intermolecular cross - linking and virtually no intramolecular cross - links ( Figure 1 ) . A co ﬁ lin - induced switch from intra - molecular to intermolecular cross - linking in F - actin suggests a modi ﬁ cation of elements of the F - actin structure that allows for its extensive cross - linking . Repeating the same experiment with skeletal actin and human co ﬁ lin - 2 yielded similar results ( not shown ) , indicating that the co ﬁ lin - induced cross - linking switch is not co ﬁ lin isoform speci ﬁ c . Actin ﬁ laments Are Formed from BPM - Cross - Linked Dimers . To ensure that the BPM - cross - linked dimers could form normal ﬁ laments , we ﬁ rst depolymerized the cross - linked ﬁ laments and then puri ﬁ ed the dimers via gel ﬁ ltration . We then polymerized the puri ﬁ ed cross - linked dimers in F - bu ﬀ er . EM images of ﬁ laments made from cross - linked dimers and un - cross - linked actin show little di ﬀ erence ( Figure 2 ) , except perhaps for the presence of some shorter and more ﬂ exible ﬁ laments among those made from cross - linked dimers ( Figure 2B ) . Mapping of Intermolecular and Intramolecular BPM - Cross - Linking Sites on Actin . An F - actin model depicting the positions of cross - linked amino acids is shown in Figure 3 . Because the BP moiety photoreacts nonselectively with amino acids , we used LC - MS / MS to determine the amino acids that are cross - linked in the absence and the presence of co ﬁ lin ( Figure 4 ) . The maleimide moiety nearly always labels the reactive Cys374 on actin , which allowed us to search for cross - linked fragments that had the peptide fragment , KCF or CF , attached to it . For the intramolecular cross - link , we measured a Figure 1 . Co ﬁ lin causes a switch from intramolecular to intermolecular cross - linking by BPM ( benzophenone - 4 - maleimide ) in F - actin . Cross - linked products are shown at time points of 0 , 60 , and 120 min after photoactivation of BPM . Cross - linking reaches a maximum in 120 min . Co ﬁ lin migrates at ∼ 16 kDa . Un - cross - linked actin migrates at ∼ 42 kDa . Intermolecularly cross - linked actins migrate at and above ∼ 84 kDa . Figure 2 . EM images of F - actin formed from BPM - cross - linked dimers ( B ) are similar to those of un - cross - linked actin ( A ) . BPM - cross - linked dimers were puri ﬁ ed by gel ﬁ ltration and then polymerized into F - actin . Figure 3 . Actin sites involved in intermolecular and intramolecular cross - linking by BPM . The amino acids on actin protomers cross - linked by BPM in the presence and absence of co ﬁ lin , and the distances between these residues are identi ﬁ ed on the model of three actin protomers in F - actin . 27 In the absence of co ﬁ lin , BPM cross - links actin intramolecularly between residues Asp11 and Cys 374 . In the presence of co ﬁ lin , BPM cross - links two actins longitudinally , between residues Met44 and Cys374 . Biochemistry Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / bi400715z | Biochemistry 2013 , 52 , 5503 − 5509 5505 unique peptide of mass 2639 . 14 Da that corresponds to fragment Ac - DEDETTALVCDNGSGLVK ( residues 1 − 18 , 1906 . 85 Da , monoisotopic mass ) that is BPM ( 277 . 07 Da ) cross - linked to KCF peptide ( 396 . 18 Da ) and with cysteine alkylation of the 1 − 18 peptide ( 57 . 02 Da ) . From the MS / MS spectrum , because product ions up to y 7 from the C - terminus and up to b 10 from the N - terminus were detected , we concluded that the cross - linking is to Asp11 . We used a similar method to determine the intermolecular cross - linking sites . We assumed that the CF peptide remained attached ; we found a unique peptide of mass 1734 . 89 Da for fragment HQGVMVGMGQK ( residues 40 − 50 , 1170 . 57 Da ) that is BPM ( 277 . 07 Da ) cross - linked to CF peptide ( 268 . 09 Da ) . The maleimide ring of BPM can open by hydrolysis , increasing the MW by 18 Da . An abundant MS / MS product ion at m / z 675 . 8 is the 2 + - charged ion representing the loss of the CF dipeptide plus the maleimide ring from cleavage between the benzophenone and maleimide rings . Because product ions up to b 4 from the N - terminus and up to y 6 from the C - terminus were detected , we concluded that the cross - linking is to Met44 and a potential cross - linking to Met47 is excluded . Actin Cross - Linking Inhibits Co ﬁ lin Dissociation by Salt . The co ﬁ lin - induced shift from intramolecular to intermolecular cross - linking in F - actin prompted us to test co ﬁ lin binding to the cross - linked ﬁ laments . Because only small amounts of puri ﬁ ed BPM - cross - linked dimers could be recovered , we also compared BPM - cross - linked actin with ANP - cross - linked actin due to their similar sites and extent of cross - linking ( Figure 5A ) . ANP forms an intermolecular cross - link between Cys374 and Gln41 in the DNaseI loop of actin , 19 i . e . , the same subdomains that BPM cross - links in the presence of co ﬁ lin . In general , co ﬁ lin binding to actin is known to decrease with increasing salt concentration of the solvent . 24 Indeed , as the salt concentration is increased , the amount of co ﬁ lin in the supernatant , i . e . , dissociated from F - actin , increases in all actin samples ( Figure 5B ) . In the presence of 0 . 75 M KCl , ∼ 80 % of co ﬁ lin is dissociated from un - cross - linked F - actin and thus found in the supernatant ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , 0 . 75 M KCl results in only ∼ 22 % dissociation of co ﬁ lin from BPM - cross - linked actin and ∼ 35 % dissociation from ANP - cross - linked actin , revealing that co ﬁ lin remains mostly bound to cross - linked actin even at high salt concentrations . A recent study by Umeki et al . 25 showed that actin mutation on Asp11 a ﬀ ected co ﬁ lin binding , inhibiting it almost completely for the D11Q actin . This result raised questions about the direct or indirect role of Asp11 on actin in co ﬁ lin binding and prompted us to test the binding of co ﬁ lin to F - actin cross - linked intramolecularly , between Cys374 and Asp11 . We show that at various concentrations of salt ( Figure 5B ) the amount of co ﬁ lin dissociated from Cys374 - Asp11 cross - linked F - actin is approximately the same as from un - cross - linked F - actin , revealing that co ﬁ lin binding is not impacted by a modi ﬁ cation / cross - linking of Asp11 . To shed light on the di ﬀ erent e ﬀ ects of salt on co ﬁ lin dissociation from cross - linked and un - cross - linked actin ( Figure 5B ) , we measured the rates of co ﬁ lin association and dissociation by a stopped - ﬂ ow method using acrylodan - labeled co ﬁ lin . To measure co ﬁ lin “ on ” rates , we used ANP - cross - linked actin , which is prepared in the absence of co ﬁ lin , 19 and not BPM - cross - linked actin that is formed in the presence of co ﬁ lin . Because of the similar binding of co ﬁ lin to ANP - and BPM - cross - linked actin , as measured by sedimentation assays in the presence of salt , we assumed that these two forms of cross - linked actin would behave similarly in binding rate assays . The binding rates for both ANP - cross - linked and un - cross - linked actins were rather similar , with the on rates less than 2 - fold lower for ANP - cross - linked actin ( Figure 5C ) . However , a major di ﬀ erence was seen in the dissociation rates . Co ﬁ lin dissociation rates from un - cross - linked actin were measured by stopped - ﬂ ow methods over the course of 10 s , while for both ANP - and BPM - cross - linked actins these measurements were done with a ﬂ uorimeter , over the course of minutes . The rates of co ﬁ lin dissociation from ANP - and BPM - cross - linked actins ( ∼ 50 % cross - linked ) are almost 15 times slower than those from un - cross - linked actin ( Figure 5D ) , suggesting that the reduced ﬂ exibility of cross - linked actin impedes co ﬁ lin dissociation . ■ DISCUSSION Chemical cross - linking is a valuable tool for probing protein − protein interactions and mapping their possible contact sites .

Biochemistry Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / bi400715z | Biochemistry 2013 , 52 , 5503 − 5509 5506 Previous reports have used this technique to map co ﬁ lin binding sites to both G - and F - actin . 5 , 6 , 8 In combination with MS / MS analysis , we identi ﬁ ed in this study the BPM - cross - linked residues in F - actin in the presence and absence of co ﬁ lin . Strikingly , the cross - link in F - actin switches from an intra - molecular ( Cys374 - Asp11 ) to an intermolecular one ( Cys374 - Met44 ) upon co ﬁ lin binding . BPM is a relatively rigid cross - linker . The maleimide moiety of BPM reacts with Cys374 while the BP moiety labels any amino acid within a ∼ 10 Å distance . 26 A recent model of F - actin 27 shows that the distance between residues Cys374 and Asp11 is greater than that between Cys374 and Met44 ( Figure 3 ) . Why does then the BP moiety cross - link Asp11 ( intra - moleculary ) instead of Met44 ( intermolecularly ) to Cys374 in F - actin alone ? Several lines of evidence are consistent with only minor cross - linking of Cys374 to Met44 in F - actin ( Figure 1 ) . First , previous attempts to mutate Met44 in yeast actin were unsuccessful , yielding a lethal phenotype and indicating a possible involvement of this residue in actin − actin contacts . 28 Second , a recent model of F - actin structure also supports the involvement of Met44 in important actin − actin contacts , 27 which can shield it from an attack by the BP moiety . Third , the C - terminus of actin is a highly ﬂ exible and dynamic region , with the exact position of the attached probe determined mostly by its interactions with the immediate environment . Thus , the ﬂ uorescence of Cys374 attached probes changes upon actin polymerization and in some case may even block the polymerization . 29 The empirical evidence of cross - linking Cys374 to Asp11 shows that the distance between the BP moiety on Cys374 and Asp11 must be within ∼ 10 Å , at least transiently . The binding of co ﬁ lin to F - actin blocks the intramolecular ( Cys374 to Asp11 ) cross - linking by BPM and shifts it to an intermolecular cross - linking ( Cys374 to Met44 ) . This leads us to consider the structural changes in F - actin that occur upon co ﬁ lin binding . Umeki et al . 25 proposed that Asp11 is a critical site on actin for co ﬁ lin interaction . In our cosedimentation Figure 5 . Co ﬁ lin remains mainly associated with cross - linked actin at high salt concentrations . ( A ) SDS - PAGE shows the ANP - cross - linked and BPM - cross - linked actin with similar extents of cross - linking . M , D , and C refer to actin monomers , actin dimers , and co ﬁ lin . Bands above D on the gel represent higher actin oligomers . ( B ) The bar graph shows the percentage of co ﬁ lin remaining in the supernatant after cosedimentation with F - actin in the presence of increasing amounts of salt . Approximately 20 % of co ﬁ lin is bound to and cosediments with control F - actin and / or the D11 - C374 cross - linked actin in the presence of 0 . 75 M KCl . In both ANP - and BPM - cross - linked actins , more than 60 % of the co ﬁ lin remains bound to actin in the presence of 0 . 75 M KCl . The assay was not performed for ANP - and BPM - actin at 0 . 25 M KCl because of their relatively small binding changes with the increments of salt . ( C ) Co ﬁ lin binds to un - cross - linked actin ( ■ ) at the faster observed rate than to ANP - cross - linked ( ⧫ ) actin . ( D ) Rates of co ﬁ lin dissociation from un - cross - linked , BPM - cross - linked , and ANP - cross - linked actins . The rates represent an average from 5 to 10 runs . Representative curves of ﬂ uorescence change are shown for the three rate measurements . Co ﬁ lin bound to BPM - and ANP - cross - linked actins shows almost 15 - fold slower rates of dissociation than from un - cross - linked actin . Biochemistry Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / bi400715z | Biochemistry 2013 , 52 , 5503 − 5509 5507 assays ( Figure 5A ) there was little di ﬀ erence between the binding of co ﬁ lin to Cys374 - Asp11 - cross - linked F - actin and un - cross - linked F - actin . This suggests that co ﬁ lin is not sensing the modi ﬁ cation / cross - linking - induced change in Asp11 and there - fore , in turn , is unlikely to change the environment or reactivity of this residue . Thus , changes in other sites of actin should be considered to explain the cross - linking shift . There is ample evidence for structural perturbation of the DNaseI loop in F - actin by co ﬁ lin . Muhlrad et al . showed that co ﬁ lin binding to F - actin accelerates manyfold the proteolysis of this loop by subtilisin , 30 indicating the loss of the loop ’ s protection and its complete accessibility to the protease . Galkin et al . 4 concluded that the twist change due to co ﬁ lin binding causes a substantial displacement of subdomain 2 in actin , resulting in its disordering . The disordering of subdomain 2 leads to a 4 - fold increase in F - actin ﬂ exibility and disruption of interprotomer contacts , 17 which without co ﬁ lin involves probably the Met44 residue . If subdomain 2 is disordered upon co ﬁ lin binding , BPM may be able to “ capture ” the now available Met44 , linking it to Cys374 . This reaction may be facilitated by the above - mentioned dynamic properties of the C - terminus of actin and the expected e ﬀ ect of co ﬁ lin on the orientation / position of the BP probe attached to Cys374 . Co ﬁ lin - induced changes in the environment of other probes ( ﬂ uorescent ) attached to Cys374 are detected most easily via changes in their ﬂ uorescence . 31 − 33 Our binding data suggest that the dissociation rate of co ﬁ lin from actin is greatly reduced by its cross - linking ( even at ∼ 50 % cross - linking level ) . The breathing motions of ﬁ laments are generally restricted upon cross - linking . It appears that such motions are needed for “ unlocking ” the bound co ﬁ lin even when its a ﬃ nity for actin is reduced by high ionic strength conditions . It is also feasible that co ﬁ lin − actin salt bridges may be re - enhanced by cross - linking , but such a possibility would have to be further tested with mutations . In conclusion , our study shows the ability to track structural changes in F - actin , both intramolecularly and intermolecularly , through BPM cross - linking . We observe a striking cross - linking shift upon co ﬁ lin binding that is consistent with changes observed in the ﬁ lament twist and dynamics . This method should be useful in studying other F - actin complexes with actin binding proteins to map structural transitions in the ﬁ laments at an amino acid resolution . In addition to co ﬁ lin , changes in the ﬁ lament twist have been documented for drebrin 34 and for several actin cross - linking and / or bundling proteins , including scruin 35 and fascin . 36 , 37 Moreover , changes in the mole ratio of these bundling proteins to actin result in considerable variation in the ﬁ lament twist change . 35 As documented here for co ﬁ lin , it would be attractive to gain more detailed understanding of structural changes in F - actin induced by these proteins . ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author * E - mail : reisler @ mbi . ucla . edu .
