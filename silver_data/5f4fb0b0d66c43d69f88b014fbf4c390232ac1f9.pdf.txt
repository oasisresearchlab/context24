Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high - throughput sequencing Qun Pan 1 , Ofer Shai 1 , 2 , Leo J Lee 1 , 2 , Brendan J Frey 1 , 2 & Benjamin J Blencowe 1 , 3 We carried out the ﬁrst analysis of alternative splicing complexity in human tissues using mRNA - Seq data . New splice junctions were detected in B 20 % of multiexon genes , many of which are tissue speciﬁc . By combining mRNA - Seq and EST - cDNA sequence data , we estimate that transcripts from ~ 95 % of multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing and that there are B 100 , 000 intermediate - to high - abundance alternative splicing events in major human tissues . From a comparison with quantitative alternative splicing microarray proﬁling data , we also show that mRNA - Seq data provide reliable measurements for exon inclusion levels . Alternative splicing is considered to be a key factor underlying increased cellular and functional complexity in higher eukaryotes 1 – 3 . From analyses of microarray proﬁling and EST - cDNA sequence data , it has been estimated that two - thirds of human genes contain one or more alternatively spliced exon 4 . However , because of the limited depth of coverage and sensitivity afforded by conventional sequencing and microarray proﬁling methods , the extent of human alternative splicing is not known 5 . High - throughput or ‘next generation’ sequen - cing technologies offer the potential to address this question 6 , and several very recent studies have applied analyses of short cDNA read ( mRNA - Seq ) data from these technologies to survey alternative splicing in mouse tissues and in human and mouse cell lines 7 – 10 . In this study , we used the Genome Analyzer system of Illumina to survey splicing complexity in diverse , normal human tissues using mRNA - Seq datasets consisting of 17 – 32 million 32 - nucleotide - long reads . We also assessed the potential of these datasets to provide quantitative measurements for alternative splicing levels . To assess human tissue alternative splicing complexity , we used mRNA - Seq datasets from whole brain , cerebral cortex , heart , skeletal muscle , lung and liver to search libraries of splice junction sequences that represent ‘known’ splicing events and candidate ‘new’ splicing events . Junction sequences designated as ‘known’ below are those supported by the analysis of aligned EST and cDNA sequences , and candidate ‘new’ splice junction sequences are those corresponding to all hypothetical , additional 5 ¢ to 3 ¢ pairings of splice sites in the same set of genes ( Fig . 1a ; and Supplementary Methods online ) . Mining of a dataset of 15 , 702 multiexon UniGene clusters , each containing one or more locus - speciﬁc RefSeq cDNA , resulted in the compilation of 257 , 257 known splice junctions and 2 , 459 , 306 candidate new junc - tions . These junction libraries were searched using reads from the six tissues , and estimates for true - positive junctions were derived as ranges ( see below ) that exclude or include ‘repeat’ junction reads , that is , those reads that map to more than one splice junction in transcripts from the 15 , 702 surveyed genes . In order to assess which reads represent true splice junctions , we trained a logistic regression classiﬁer to discriminate between known junction sequences and a set of control ‘reverse’ junction sequences , in which the 3 ¢ half of each detected known junction sequence is located upstream of the 5 ¢ half . These reverse junction sequences were used as controls to maintain inherent codon , dinucleotide and possible other compositional biases when discriminating between true and false junctions . The classiﬁer was trained using ﬁve features that reﬂect important parameters when discriminating true - and false - positive alignments between mRNA - Seq reads and splice junction regions ( Supplementary Methods ) . The classiﬁer achieves 94 % sensitivity at a speciﬁcity of 95 % , as determined by tenfold cross - validation ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . The parameters learned by the classiﬁer were applied to the known and new junctions on the basis of statistics obtained from sequence reads from each tissue , and the numbers of true versus false junctions were determined in the known and new junction datasets for all six tissues . When combining the mRNA - Seq data from the six tissues we detected between 128 , 395 ( 49 . 9 % ) and 130 , 854 ( 50 . 9 % ) of the 257 , 257 known junctions ( Fig . 1b ) , whereas only 121 ( 0 . 04 % ) to 135 ( 0 . 052 % ) of the corresponding control junctions were detected , respectively . Each tissue dataset contributed between 18 % and 31 % of the detected known junctions . Thus , from proﬁling only six human tissues , we were able to detect approximately half of the splice junctions represented in EST - cDNA databases . This observation could reﬂect previous results from EST - cDNA analyses and microarray proﬁling studies indicating that most tissues , including those analyzed in the present study , express B 6 , 000 to 10 , 000 mRNA genes , and that brain and liver show relatively high frequencies of alternative splicing compared to other tissues 11 – 13 . From the mRNA - Seq data , we also detected between 4 , 294 and 11 , 099 new splice junctions ( Fig . 1b ) , which corresponds to a detection rate of one or more new splice junction in 2 , 948 ( 18 . 8 % ) to 3 , 788 ( 24 . 1 % ) of the surveyed genes . When combining EST , cDNA and mRNA - Seq data , we observed that more than 85 % of the multi - exon genes analyzed contain at least one alternative splicing event . © 2008 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e g e n e t i cs Received 17 July ; accepted 19 August ; published online 2 November 2008 ; addendum published after print 28 April 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 259 1 Banting and Best Department of Medical Research , University of Toronto , Toronto M5S 3E1 , Canada . 2 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , University of Toronto , Toronto M5S 3G4 , Canada . 3 Department of Molecular Genetics , University of Toronto , Toronto M5S 3E1 , Canada .

NATURE GENETICS VOLUME 40 [ NUMBER 12 [ DECEMBER 2008 1413 B R I E F C O M M U N I C AT I O N S However , at increased levels of read coverage ( that is , 16 to > 500 reads per 100 nucleotides ) , alternative splicing events can be detected in 92 – 97 % of multiexon genes ( Supplementary Methods ) . This represents a substantial increase over a previous estimate ( 74 % ) 4 for the proportion of multiexon genes that contain one or more alternative splicing event . Given that our analysis of mRNA - Seq data detects approximately half of known junctions , and that there is an almost linear increase in the detection rate of new junctions as data from each tissue is added ( Fig . 1b ) , we predict that with full coverage the numbers of new junctions would be at least twice those detected in the present data . To assess the degree to which known and new junctions detected in the mRNA - Seq data may represent tissue - dependent splicing events , we investigated the frequencies at which detected splice junctions formed by skipping of one or more exons are unique to indivi - dual tissues , or are common to two or more tissues ( Fig . 1c ) . In each case , there were signiﬁcantly more junctions that were detected in only one tissue , and these could represent tissue - speciﬁc or tissue - restricted splice variants , as well as possible lower - abundance splice variants that are widely expressed but only detected in a single tissue . We also examined the tissue speciﬁcity of all ( n ¼ 439 ) new splice junctions that were detected in two of the six tissues . In the plot shown in Figure 1d , the sizes of the blue squares indicate the proportions of the over - laps between new splice junctions when com - paring pairs of tissues . This shows that a greater proportion of new splice junctions are commonly detected in whole brain and cerebral cortex , or in skeletal muscle and heart , than the proportion of new junctions commonly detected in any of the other pairs of tissues . This indicates that many of the new splice junctions reﬂect the physiolo - gical origin of the tissues analyzed and therefore likely represent examples of new tissue - speciﬁc alternative splicing events , in addition to new alter - native splicing events in transcripts with tissue - restricted expression patterns . Supplementary Table 1 online lists genes with more than ﬁve new splice junctions . Many of these genes encode ‘giant’ and other muscle - speciﬁc proteins , thus revealing a previously unappreciated degree of alternative splicing complexity in transcripts from muscle - speciﬁc genes . These ﬁndings are consistent with previous proposals that alternative splicing of transcripts encoding some of these proteins has an important role in controlling fundamental mechanical proper - ties of muscle , such as tension and contractility 14 .

Accord - ingly , we determined the median number of alternative splicing events per exon for genes with different numbers of total exons and with similar overall levels of Illumina read coverage ( Fig . 2a ) . Despite the theoretical possibility of a quadratic ( n 2 ) increase in the number of alternative splicing possibilities as the number of exons per gene increases , our results indicate that the number of alternative splicing events per gene increases in a near linear fashion ( Fig . 2a ) . Thus , notably , the frequency of alternative splicing detection per exon does not rise in genes with increasing numbers of exons , and this observa - tion suggests that selection pressure may act to generally limit splicing complexity in large genes . This observation facilitates assessment of the total number of alternative splicing events in human tissues . When considering that the frequency of new alternative splicing events detected in the six different tissues can be extrapolated to other human tissues , it is possible to derive an estimate for the total number of alternative splicing events that can be detected by comparable methods . By combining the rates of detection of new and known alternative splicing events afforded by mRNA - Seq and EST - cDNA data , respectively , we observed that the median number of alternative splicing events per exon is between 0 . 5 and 0 . 75 for genes with intermediate to high levels of Illumina sequence coverage ( 32 – 256 reads per 100 bases ; see Fig . 2b ) . Given that 175 , 944 exons were mined from 15 , 702 multiexon human genes , we predict that on the order of 88 , 000 – 132 , 000 alternative splicing events of comparable abundance as those detected in the present study are expressed in major human tissues . This estimate further suggests that , on average , there are at least seven alternative splicing events per multiexon human gene . An important question concerning high - throughput sequencing technologies is their capacity to generate reliable quantitative mea - surements for alternative splicing levels . To address this question , we compared estimates for percent exon inclusion from the mRNA - Seq data described above with percent inclusion estimates generated from proﬁling B 5000 cassette - type alternative exons in the same six human tissues using our previously validated 15 , quantitative alternative splicing microarray system ( unpublished data , Supplementary Fig . 2a and Supplementary Methods online ) . When applying a threshold of 20 or more reads per tissue that match any one of the three splice junction sequences representing inclusion and skipping of a cassette exon , there is a high correlation ( r ¼ 0 . 80 , n ¼ 1 , 548 ) between the alternative splicing microarray - and mRNA - Seq – derived predictions for percent inclusion . The correlation increases ( r ¼ 0 . 85 , n ¼ 546 ) when a threshold of 50 or more junction matching reads is used . Predictions for percent inclusion levels from the two systems also agree well for tissue - regulated alternative exons ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2b and Supplementary Information ) . Together , the results described above show that mRNA - Seq data can be used to reliably measure alternative splicing levels , in addition to revealing important new insights into alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome .
