A role for altered phagosome maturation in the long - term persistence of Helicobacter pylori infection . Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 303 : G169 – G179 , 2012 .

This results in chronic inﬂammation , which can develop into gastric or duodenal ulcers in 10 % of infected individuals and gastric cancer in 1 % of infections . The determinants for these more severe pathologies include host ( e . g . , high IL - 1 (cid:1) expression polymor - phisms ) , bacterial [ e . g . , cytotoxicity - associated gene ( cag ) pathogenicity island ] , and environmental ( e . g . , dietary nitrites ) factors . However , it is the failure of host immune effector cells to eliminate H . pylori that underlies its persistence and the subsequent H . pylori - associated disease . Here we discuss the mechanisms used by H . pylori to survive the host immune response and , in particular , the role played by altered phagosome maturation . chronic inﬂammation ; gastric cancer ; macrophage ; phagocytic killing ; ulcer HELICOBACTER PYLORI IS A MOTILE , spiral - shaped , microaerophilic bacterium that primarily colonizes the human stomach and may also be found in areas of gastric metaplasia in the duodenum ( 145 ) . H . pylori is one of the most successful human patho - gens : it is estimated to have infected (cid:2) 50 % of the world’s population , with varying rates of infection in different coun - tries ( 49 ) . For example , in Australia , the overall seroprevalence of H . pylori is 15 % ( 101 ) ; in the developing world , rates as high as 90 % have been reported ( 87 ) . Higher prevalence is correlated with a variety of factors , including increased age , low socioeconomic status , and poor sanitation ( 31 ) . H . pylori causes a range of gastric pathologies and is responsible for 70 – 75 % of gastric ulcers , 90 – 95 % of duodenal ulcers ( 54 ) , and , as the principal etiological agent for gastric cancer , 5 . 5 % of all cancer in humans ( 26 , 57 , 115 ) . While H . pylori elicits a strong innate and adaptive immune response in all infected individuals , this fails to clear the infection ( 5 , 142 ) . The long - term persistence of infection results in chronic stimulation of the inﬂammatory immune response , which underlies all H . pylori - associated disease . The standard treatment regimens for H . pylori infection are triple and quadruple therapies that are administered over 1 or 2 wk ( 93 ) . However , the incidence of treatment failure has steadily increased over the last two decades , reaching 20 % in many populations ( 62 ) . This is reportedly due to two factors : 1 ) poor patient compliance due to the 1 - or 2 - wk therapies and 2 ) in - creasing rates of H . pylori antibiotic resistance worldwide ( 34 , 62 ) . We have reviewed the mechanisms used by H . pylori to avoid elimination by the host and , in particular , immune effector cells . Determination of the mechanism by which this bacterium evades immune killing has the potential to identify new approaches for therapeutics to clear H . pylori infection from the host . Colonization of the Gastric Niche To colonize the human stomach , H . pylori must ﬁrst over - come two important physical barriers : stomach acid and the gastric mucous layer . The low - pH environment in the human stomach plays a vital role in preventing bacterial growth and colonization . H . pylori urease is thought to buffer the acid in the lumen of the stomach , through the hydrolysis of urea to bicarbonate and ammonia , thereby creating a neutral microen - vironment around the bacterium ( 39 , 99 ) . Urease activity is coupled with an acid - gated urea channel , which enables H . pylori to maintain a neutral cytoplasmic pH on exposure to acidic conditions ( 148 ) . H . pylori that have survived the acid in the stomach are then able to negotiate the thick gastric mucous layer , courtesy of their spiral shape and multiple polar ﬂagella ( 108 , 150 ) . After traversing the mucous layer and reaching the gastric epithelium , H . pylori is believed to avoid being ﬂushed away during the continual replenishment of the gastric mucosa by using a range of adhesins to tightly attach to the cells of the gastric epithelium ( 109 ) . This allows H . pylori to escape the acidic conditions in the lumen of the stomach and gain access to gastric epithelial cells , which may act as a source of essential Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : G .

Acute Inﬂammatory Immune Response Through animal models and human trials , it has been estab - lished that primary infection with H . pylori results in the host mounting an acute inﬂammatory immune response that devel - ops into chronic gastritis ( 27 , 40 ) . The acute inﬂammatory immune response is initiated following contact between H . pylori and gastric epithelial cells . H . pylori urease , cytotoxin - associated gene ( cag ) A ( CagA ) , and the cag pathogenicity island ( cag PAI ) stimulate rapid activation of the transcription factors NF - (cid:3) B and activator protein ( AP ) 1 ( 19 ) and induction of the proinﬂammatory chemokines IL - 8 , growth - regulated oncogene - (cid:4) ( GRO - (cid:4) ) , regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) , macrophage inﬂammatory protein ( MIP ) - 1 (cid:4) , and MIP - 3 (cid:4) ( 28 , 106 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Neutrophils , monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells , which are re - cruited to the gastric mucosa , then escalate inﬂammation through secretion of the proinﬂammatory cytokines IL - 1 (cid:1) , IL - 8 , and TNF (cid:4) ( 5 , 28 , 71 , 77 , 83 , 107 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . In a mouse model , neutrophils and eosinophils accounted for the ﬁrst wave of inﬁltrating innate immune effector cells , with increased numbers at 8 wk and then at 26 wk after experimental infec - tion , while a second wave of inﬁltrating macrophages was recorded at 26 wk after infection ( 6 , 121 ) . In a challenge model utilizing human volunteers , the number of lymphocytes and monocytes in H . pylori - infected gastric mucosa increased 2 wk after infection . This was followed 4 wk after infection by increased numbers of CD4 (cid:5) and CD8 (cid:5) T cells , signifying the start of an adaptive immune response ( 63 ) . The importance of T cells in the immune response to H . pylori was shown in another human trial , in which the apparent clearance of acute H . pylori infection in some individuals was associated with circulating T cells ( 1 ) . Adaptive Immune Response Macrophages and dendritic cells located in the lamina pro - pria of the gastric mucosa play an important role in antigen presentation and initiation of the adaptive immune response to H . pylori ( 83 , 138 , 146 ) . For example , H . pylori has been shown to stimulate the release of IL - 6 from macrophages in a process that is dependent on phagocytosis ( 111 ) . IL - 6 is one of the principal drivers of the adaptive immune response , regu - lating the ratio of T helper type 17 ( Th17 ) cells to T regulatory ( Treg ) cells ( 24 ) and stimulating the differentiation of B cells into antibody - producing plasma cells ( 82 ) . The H . pylori - speciﬁc , cell - mediated adaptive immune re - sponse consists of a complex mixture of T helper ( Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 ) and Treg cells inﬁltrating the inﬂamed gastric mucosa . The predominant T cell type in the H . pylori - infected gastric mucosa is the proinﬂammatory Th1 cell ( 20 ) . Th1 cells promote inﬂammation and tissue damage principally through IFN (cid:6) and IL - 12 ( 133 ) . Th1 effects can be modulated by the characteristic Th2 cytokine IL - 4 , which appears to downregu - late IL - 12 production ( 116 ) , and H . pylori directly stimulates gastric epithelial cells to produce thymic stromal lymphopoi - etin , inducing a dendritic cell - mediated Th2 response ( 79 ) . Recently , the importance of Th17 cells and the Th17 - to - Treg ratio in mucosal damage and immune escape has been estab - lished . Skewing the Th17 - to - Treg ratio toward a Th17 - based response is critical to the development of a vaccine - mediated clearance but also increases the amount of inﬂammation - based damage , whereas skewing the ratio toward a Treg response is required for H . pylori immune escape and tolerance ( 73 ) . In addition to the T cell - mediated adaptive immune re - sponse , a strong antibody response to H . pylori is mounted in all infected individuals ( 41 ) . Local and systemic antibodies have been detected in H . pylori - infected individuals ( 122 , 151 ) , and B cells speciﬁc for H . pylori have been detected in the Fig . 1 . Development of inﬂammatory and adaptive immune responses to Helicobacter pylori infection . H . pylori stimulates gastric epithelial cells to release the proinﬂammatory chemokines IL - 8 , growth - regulated oncogene - (cid:4) ( GRO - (cid:4) ) , regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) , macrophage inﬂammatory protein ( MIP ) - 1 (cid:4) , and MIP - 3 (cid:4) by activating the nuclear transcription factors NF - (cid:3) B and / or activator protein 1 ( AP - 1 ) through attachment or by cytotoxin - associated gene A ( CagA ) - depen - dent and - independent means . These chemokines recruit and activate neutro - phils , macrophages , and dendritic cells , which further enhance the inﬂamma - tory immune response by releasing proinﬂammatory cytokines , in particular , IL - 8 , IL - 1 (cid:1) , and TNF (cid:4) . Macrophages and dendritic cells then initiate the adaptive immune response by antigen presentation and release of cytokines that drive differentiation of T helper cell subsets [ Th1 , Th2 , Th17 , and T regulatory ( Treg ) ] . IL - 12 and IFN (cid:6) induce a Th1 - polarized response with concomitant production of IFN (cid:6) ; TGF (cid:1) , IL - 23 , and IL - 6 / IL - 2 regulate the Th17 - to - Treg ratio , resulting in release of IL - 17 or TGF (cid:1) / IL - 10 by Th17 or Treg cells , respectively ; IL - 4 and IL - 2 / thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) provide the stimulus for a Th2 ( IL - 4 ) - mediated response and downstream production of H . pylori - speciﬁc antibodies by B cells .

However , since it is possible to elicit protective immunity in mice that lack B cells ( 53 , 137 ) and since H . pylori infection is not cleared in humans without antibiotic intervention , the humoral immune response has been considered to be an indication of infection , rather than a marker of protection ( 72 ) . Furthermore , on the basis of evidence obtained using a B cell - deﬁcient mouse model , H . pylori - speciﬁc antibodies may actually enhance colonization ( 3 , 72 ) . Inability of the Immune Response to Eliminate H . pylori Despite eliciting a strong innate and adaptive immune re - sponse , H . pylori is rarely cleared from its gastric niche , with infections known to persist for decades ( 142 ) . The fact that H . pylori is able to persist in the face of a strong antibody response and a strong H . pylori - speciﬁc adaptive T cell response and in an environment characterized by the presence of large numbers of activated neutrophils and macrophages suggests that H . pylori has mechanisms to avoid cell - free , T cell - mediated , and phagocytic killing ( 8 ) . The observation that the antibody - based immune response to H . pylori is ineffective suggests that H . pylori is exquisitely adapted to avoid the plethora of antibody - based killing mech - anisms , including the agglutinating effects of antibodies in the gastric mucous layer and antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity . In addition , H . pylori has been shown to prevent complement - mediated killing by reducing opsonization ( 127 ) and blocking the assembly of the membrane attack complex ( 125 ) . Finally , H . pylori can reduce agglutination by the collectin surfactant protein D , via lipopolysaccharide phase variation ( 76 ) . The H . pylori - speciﬁc T cell adaptive immune response does not eliminate the bacterium from its gastric niche , and while skewing to a Th17 response can reduce the bacterial load in animal models , it does not provide sterilizing immunity ( 2 , 143 ) . The effect of Th17 cells is somewhat controversial , with some reports that they reduce inﬂammation and others that they promote inﬂammation ( 4 , 102 , 113 , 131 ) . Nevertheless , Th17 cells are instrumental in providing protective immunity and recruiting polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) , bridging the gap between the innate and adaptive immune response ( 45 ) . Finally , H . pylori recruits and activates large numbers of Treg cells ( 92 ) , which are now seen to be critical for downregulation of inﬂammation and promotion of bacterial growth ( 73 ) . There is growing evidence that H . pylori can invade the gastric mucosa with the detection of whole coccoid and spiral forms of H . pylori beyond the epithelial cell layer , within the lamina propria ( 17 , 100 , 114 ) . Moreover , these bacteria have been observed in close association with inﬂammatory im - mune cells ( 105 ) and macrophages ( 69 ) . H . pylori appears to be effectively phagocytosed by neutrophils , monocytes , and mac - rophages in vivo ( 52 , 69 , 105 , 134 , 155 ) and in vitro ( 7 , 16 , 36 ) . Despite this engulfment , H . pylori appears to be able to avoid intracellular killing . For example , after phagocytizing H . pylori , neutrophils become activated , but the ingested bacteria are not always eliminated ( 10 , 123 , 124 ) , and H . pylori has been shown to survive for up to 48 h within monocytes and macrophages ( 14 , 29 , 110 , 126 , 130 , 153 ) . There is increasing evidence that H . pylori facilitates this survival by altering phagosome maturation to attenuate the destructive effects of the phagosome . Alteration of phagosome maturation is likely to have other effects on immune responses that are mediated from the phagosome , such as antigen presentation . Thus , strat - egies that restore the normal functioning of inﬁltrating neutro - phils , macrophages , and dendritic cells could lead to 1 ) en - hanced antimicrobial effector function of these cells and 2 ) po - tentiation of the adaptive immune response , which depends on antigen - presenting and paracrine - signaling functions . Chronic Inﬂammation and H . pylori - Associated Disease The failure of the immune response to eliminate H . pylori results in chronic inﬂammation of the gastric mucosa . H . pylori continually stimulates gastric epithelial cells and inﬁltrating neutrophils , macrophages , and other lymphocytes to release proinﬂammatory cytokines , which enhance the inﬂammatory response ( 60 , 66 , 152 ) . H . pylori recombinant urease is a potent stimulator of IL - 12 and IFN (cid:6) secretions from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( 97 ) , and when dendritic cells are cocultured with H . pylori , they secrete proinﬂammatory IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 12 , IL - 1 (cid:1) , and TNF (cid:4) ( 65 , 84 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . IL - 12 stimulates the differentiation of naïve T cells into a Th1 phenotype ( 22 , 42 , 64 ) . Th1 cells are proinﬂammatory and secrete IFN (cid:6) ( 20 , 74 ) . IL - 6 promotes the clonal expansion of Th17 cells ( 24 ) , which release IL - 17 , a proinﬂammatory cytokine previously associ - ated with other chronic inﬂammatory conditions , such as rheu - matoid arthritis ( 81 ) , and was found to be elevated in the H . pylori - infected stomach ( 94 ) . Furthermore , IL - 17 has been implicated in PMN recruitment ( 86 ) ; thus the activities of Th17 cells bridge the gap between the adaptive and innate phago - cytic processes . This PMN / Th1 / Th17 response forms the basis of the chronic inﬂammatory immune response that is the hallmark of H . pylori infection ( Fig . 1 ) . It is also the nature and location of the chronic infection induced by H . pylori that underlie the different manifestations of H . pylori - associated disease . If the inﬂammation is limited to the antrum of the stomach , the resultant increase in acid production can cause gastric metaplasia and duodenal ulcer - ation . In contrast , if the inﬂammation is pan - gastric , or corpus - predominant , the resultant hypochlorhydria can lead , instead , to the development of gastric ulcers or gastric cancer ( 18 , 51 , 78 ) . The generally accepted model of gastric carcinogenesis involves a sequential progression from chronic inﬂammation to mucosal atrophy , metaplasia , and dysplasia ( 37 , 38 ) , and this is supported by the study of Wong and co - workers ( 149 ) , who showed that only patients with atrophic gastritis developed cancer in a 7 . 5 - yr prospective study . The idiosyncratic nature of the host inﬂammatory response also inﬂuences the outcome of infection . For example , in Western populations , high - ex - pression IL - 1 (cid:1) polymorphisms lead to enhanced inﬂammation , hypochlorhydria , and atrophic gastritis and are associated with increased risk of gastric cancer in H . pylori - infected individu - als ( 50 ) . The failure of the immune response to clear H . pylori from the host perpetuates the inﬂammatory condition , which pro - vides the necessary background for more serious disease out - comes . This raises the important question : How does H . pylori evade being killed by the critical immune effector cells , such as phagocytic cells , which are recruited in large numbers to the site of infection ?

Mutations in catalase ( 21 ) , ClpP ATP - dependent caseinolytic protease and its chaperone ClpA ( 89 ) , and RuvC Holliday junction resolvase ( 90 ) have resulted in reduced survival of H . pylori in macrophages due to an inability to avoid the destructive effects of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Similarly , H . pylori mutants defective in SpoT synthetase ( 154 ) were unable to survive the bacterial stress response initiated after phagocytosis by macrophages . Finally , it has been reported that the deletion of VacA ( 153 ) or urease ( 130 ) resulted in reduced survival of H . pylori in macrophage cell lines and that VacA and urease are implicated in disruption of the phagosome maturation process . Neutrophils and macrophages have oxidative and nonoxidative mechanisms of phagocytic killing ( 103 ) . Oxidative killing in - volves the generation of bactericidal metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen ( Fig . 2 ) . ROS and reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) are produced in the respiratory burst , a process that occurs soon after phagocytosis and is characterized by the consumption of large amounts of oxygen . The NADPH oxidase complex is assembled on the membrane of forming phagosomes from membrane - bound ( ﬂavocytochrome b 558 ) and cytosolic ( p47 phox , p67 phox , and rac2 ) components and generates the superoxide anion from molecular oxygen in the phagosomal lumen ( 104 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Detoxiﬁcation of ROS and RNS . H . pylori has developed a battery of antioxidant proteins that enable it to avoid oxidative destruction ( 147 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . H . pylori superoxide dismutase ( SodB ) and catalase ( KatA ) act in sequence to detoxify super - oxide anion and hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen ( 117 ) . H . pylori uses arginase ( RocF ) to avoid the antimicrobial effects of macrophage - derived nitric oxides through competi - tion for the common substrate L - arginine ( 61 ) . H . pylori alkyl hydroperoxide reductase ( AhpC ) has been shown to have peroxynitrite reductase activity in vitro , which is likely to contribute to H . pylori resistance to RNS killing ( 33 ) . The H . pylori neutrophil - activating protein ( NapA ) has two contradic - tory roles in H . pylori infection . One function of NapA is recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the infected mu - cosa and stimulation of these neutrophils and monocytes to produce ROS ( 55 , 129 ) . However , NapA also appears to protect H . pylori from oxidative stress damage , as NapA expression is upregulated in H . pylori strains carrying muta - tions in the major oxidative stress resistance factors : SodB , KatA , and AhpC ( 112 , 147 ) . Resisting vacuolar - type H (cid:5) - ATPase - mediated acidiﬁcation of the phagosome . H . pylori encounters acid conditions inside the maturing phagosome similar to those in the stomach lumen . During normal phagosome maturation , phagosomes progres - sively recruit vacuolar - type H (cid:5) - ATPase ( vATPase ) to the phagosomal membrane , which decreases pH from 6 . 1 – 6 . 5 in the early phagosome to 4 . 5 in the phagolysosome ( 56 ) . It is likely that H . pylori resists the phagosome’s increasing proton concentration in the same way that it tolerates the high acid conditions encountered in the stomach lumen : with urease - mediated production of bicarbonate and ammonium ions ( 130 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Disruption of NADPH oxidase targeting and speciﬁc gran - ule recruitment . H . pylori disrupts NADPH oxidase targeting in neutrophils , so that superoxide anions are released to the extracellular space , rather than accumulating in the phago - somal lumen ( 13 ) , which also has implications for tissue damage and nutrient release . In neutrophils , after nonopsonized uptake , H . pylori phagosomes acquired ﬂavocytochrome b 558 but did not recruit or retain p47 phox or p67 phox . The assembled NADPH oxidase complex appeared in patches on the cell surface . The bacterial factors responsible for this appeared to be surface - associated ( 13 ) . In a process akin to phagosome maturation in macrophages , nonoxidative killing by neutrophils involves the fusion of neutrophilic granules with phagosomes to deliver a cache of antimicrobial enzymes and peptides to the phagosome . Neu - trophils have repositories of antimicrobial ROS and RNS and proteases / hydrolases stored in granules ready for release into the phagosome after vesicle fusion . The speciﬁc granule factor lacto - ferrin has not been located in H . pylori neutrophil phagosomes ( 13 ) , suggesting that , during the misdirection of NADPH oxidase assembly to the plasma membrane , H . pylori also inﬂuences the recruitment of granules to the phagosome . This indicates signiﬁ - cant disruptions to the phagosome machinery ( see Disruption of phagosome maturation ) . Delayed phagocytosis . Previous in vitro studies involving H . pylori phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages have indicated that some H . pylori strains are able to exert control over the cell’s phagocytic uptake mechanisms , slowing the process of phagocytosis . This strain - speciﬁc delay in the rate of phagocytic uptake is associated with type 1 H . pylori strains , which express a more potent form of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA and harbor a type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) encoded by the cag PAI . Metabolically active type 1 strains of H . pylori ( strains associated with more severe disease phenotypes ) delay Fig . 2 . Antioxidant systems of H . pylori . Activated neutrophils and macro - phages express high levels of NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ; blue ) to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( ROS and RNS ; green ) from molecular oxygen and arginine ( black ) in the respiratory burst . H . pylori combats effects of these bactericidal metabolites with a battery of antioxidant mechanisms ( red ) that detoxify the metabolites [ superoxide dismutase ( SodB ) converts superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide , which is converted by catalase ( KatA ) to water and oxygen ; alkyl hydroperoxide reductase ( AhpC ) reduces peroxynitrite to NOH ] , sequester vital cofactors [ Fe ions required for production of the hydroxyl radical are sequestered by neutrophil - activating protein ( NapA ) ] , or remove the substrate ( the arginine substrate for iNOS is converted to urea by RocF and then to ammonium ions by urease ) .

Although the innate receptors that initiate H . pylori phagocytosis are unknown ( 9 ) , studies have shown that type 1 H . pylori strains utilize a novel signaling cascade during delayed phagocytosis . The type 1 H . pylori strains are reported to activate atypical PKC (cid:7) to regulate local actin polymerization on the forming phagosomal mem - brane , thereby avoiding PKC (cid:4) - mediated activation of the re - spiratory burst ( 11 , 12 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Regulation of bacterial uptake via this mechanism is thought to assist in the extended survival of type 1 H . pylori strains in phagosomes ( 9 ) . Extension of the time before internalization could give type 1 H . pylori strains the opportunity to synthesize and deliver proteins ( into cells ) that are required to enable survival within phagosomes . Disruption of phagosome maturation . Phagosomes normally mature through a series of sequential fusion and ﬁssion inter - actions with early endosomes , late endosomes , and lysosomes , gaining and losing markers characteristic of these compart - ments ( 46 , 47 ) . The phagosome maturation process is further characterized by decreasing luminal pH due to the accumula - tion of hydrogen ions transported by vATPase proton pumps on the phagosomal membrane ( 68 ) and , ﬁnally , the delivery of acid hydrolases . As such , the gradual remodeling of a phago - some into a fully degradative phagolysosome recapitulates the three stages of the endocytic pathway ( Fig . 3 ) . However , H . pylori appears to generate a hybrid compartment with reduced degradative capacity that retains characteristics of early - stage phagosomes and phagolysosomes ( 30 , 75 , 130 , 153 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Early studies investigating the H . pylori compartment in mac - rophages described an actin - binding protein coronin 1 ( TACO ) , which was abnormally retained on the H . pylori compartment long after closure of the phagocytic cup , in a VacA - dependent manner ( 153 ) . The H . pylori compartment accumulated early Fig . 3 . H . pylori phagosome maturation . H . pylori utilizes atypical PKC (cid:7) to delay phagocytosis , allowing time for synthesis / delivery of components necessary for disruption of phagosome maturation . In neutrophils , NADPH oxidase is assembled at the cell surface , externalizing ROS . RocF outcompetes iNOS for the common substrate arginine , reducing RNS inside the cell and producing urea , which is converted to ammonium by urease , thereby nulling the effects of increasing H (cid:5) concentrations from the progressive accumulation of vacuolar H (cid:5) - ATPase ( vATPase ) pumps on the phagosome membrane . H . pylori retains the early phagosome marker coronin 1 ( TACO ) , despite gaining markers of the early endosomes Rab5 and early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) . TACO , Rab5 , and EEA1 are retained on the phagosome , while Rab7 and CD63 are recruited . EEA1 tethers phagosomes arranged in close apposition , enabling homotypic fusion to form megasomes . Individual phagosomes and megasomes retain TACO , EEA1 , Rab7 , and CD63 while continuing to recruit lyosomal - associated membrane protein ( LAMP ) - 1 and LAMP - 2 .

In one such study , H . pylori phagosomes acquired and retained EEA1 and Rab7 , despite also acquiring the late endosome / lysosome membrane markers CD63 , LAMP - 1 , and LAMP - 2 ( 30 ) . Thus it appeared that H . pylori compartments underwent normal fusion reactions with endosomes , but there was aberrant recovery of these components during the ﬁssion stage ( Fig . 3 ) . Several groups have reported abnormal phagosomes con - taining multiple bacteria in H . pylori - infected macrophages ( 14 , 30 , 126 , 130 , 153 ) . These communal compartments , al - ternately termed “megasomes” ( 14 , 30 , 130 , 153 ) , or large communal vesicles ( LCVs ) ( 126 ) , are believed to arise due to the homotypic fusion of phagosomes containing a single bac - terium ( Fig . 3 ) . LCVs reportedly differ from megasomes , as they contain internal membranes resembling giant multivesicu - lar bodies ( 126 ) . The appearance of megasomes was reported to be characteristic of type 1 H . pylori strains ( 14 , 153 ) , whereas LCVs were observed in macrophages , regardless of the H . pylori strain’s vacA or cag status ( 30 , 126 ) . The study of isogenic mutant strains of H . pylori has demonstrated that VacA and urease are essential for megasome formation ( 130 , 153 ) . Megasomes and LCVs appear to arise 2 – 4 h after internalization and persist for (cid:1) 24 h ( 14 , 30 , 126 , 130 , 153 ) . EEA1 normally acts to tether early endosomes for homo - typic endosome fusion and probably plays a similar role in the formation of H . pylori megasomes . Thus , EEA1 attaches to phagosomes , which are transported toward the microtubule organizing center [ via continued association with Rab7 , Rab - interacting lysosomal protein ( RILP ) , and the dynein - dynactin motor complex ] , where they come in closer contact . EEA1 would then promote homotypic phagosome fusion , to result in the creation of megasomes ( 30 , 130 ) . In epithelial cells , the VacA - mediated retention of active Rab7 on the H . pylori vacuolar compartment promotes fusion with late endosome compartments ( 140 ) . Rab7 retention on H . pylori phagosomes has similarly been shown in primary human macrophages ( 30 ) , and this active Rab7 could facilitate the movement of phago - somes toward the perinuclear region of the cell , thereby con - tributing to megasome formation . In addition to disrupting the integrity of the gastric epithe - lium and invading the gastric mucosa , H . pylori has also been described as a facultative intracellular organism , able to enter and survive within the cells of the human gastric epithelium ( 48 , 119 ) . Using ultrastructural analysis ( transmission electron microscopy ) of human gastric biopsy specimens derived from H . pylori - infected individuals , several groups have described in vivo intracellular H . pylori ( 119 ) . In vitro , H . pylori has been shown to invade the human gastric adenocarcinoma ( AGS ) epithelial cell line ( 15 , 25 , 85 , 118 , 120 , 135 , 140 ) . Entry of H . pylori appears to occur via a receptor - mediated endocytic process that is reliant on interaction with host cell (cid:1) 1 - integrin ( 69 , 135 ) via a zipper - like mechanism utilizing phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase and PKC ( 85 ) . Once internalized , viable bacteria have been observed in large VacA - dependent vacuolar structures , from which they can also engineer their release into the extracellular environment ( 15 , 85 , 140 ) . This phagosome - like compartment is characterized by the presence of late endosome ( Rab7 ) and lysosome ( LAMP - 1 and LIMP - 1 ) mark - ers ( 85 , 140 ) . It remains unclear whether H . pylori - containing vesicles in gastric epithelial cells associate with early endo - somes . No colocalization of Rab5 or phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate with the large H . pylori - containing vacuolar struc - tures was observed after 24 h of infection in AGS cells ( 140 ) . Nor was colocalization of Rab5 or EEA1 observed with VacA toxin - derived vesicles in HeLa cells ( a cervical cancer - derived epithelial cell line ) 20 h after these cells were incubated with the toxin ( 88 ) . However , neither study examined earlier time points . HeLa cells treated with VacA toxin and examined ( by confocal laser scanning microscopy ) 30 min and 2 h later showed colocalization of EEA1 with vacuoles at 30 min but not at 2 h ( 58 , 59 ) . Whether colocalization occurs in gastric epithelial cells between Rab5 , EEA1 , and other early endo - some markers and live bacteria is yet to be determined . It is clear that the formation of these large vacuolar structures , but not entry of the bacteria into gastric epithelial cells , depends on the presence of VacA toxin . AGS cells infected with VacA mutant H . pylori still internalized viable bacteria , and the smaller vacuoles that contained these bacteria remained posi - tive for Rab7 and both lysosomal markers ( LAMP - 1 and LIMP - 1 ) ( 140 ) . Several different strategies have been employed by intracel - lular pathogens to alter phagosome maturation and avoid phagocytic killing . Mycobacterium tuberculosis arrests phago - some maturation at an early stage : it recruits Rab5 , but it blocks the recruitment of Rab5 effectors . The resultant lack of phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphatate accumulation on the M . tuberculosis phagosome prevents its maturation into a phagoly - sosome with degradative capacity ( 70 , 144 ) . Legionella pneu - mophila establishes a replicative niche within an endoplasmic reticulum - derived compartment , through the actions of a range of effectors encoded on the Dot - Icm T4SS ( 132 ) . Coxiella burnetii ( the causative agent of Q fever ) alters its intracellular compartment to resemble an autophagosome , which results in delayed fusion with lysosomes ( 23 , 128 ) . Although this com - partment becomes acidiﬁed ( pH (cid:8) 4 . 8 ) and gains some lyso - somal proteins , C . burnetii avoids phagosomal killing for sufﬁcient time to become replicative ( 96 ) . The speciﬁc viru - lence factors that enable it to avoid destruction are largely unidentiﬁed , but there is a great deal of interest in the genes encoded on the C . burnetii T4SS ( 56 ) . It appears that H . pylori has developed a mechanism distinct from the latter processes that targets endosomal machinery , preventing the recovery and ﬁssion of these organelles during the phagosome maturation process ( 30 ) . It is evident that the immune response to H . pylori is ineffective , because the arsenal of antimicrobial devices em - ployed with and without effector cells that normally eliminate the bacteria has been compromised . H . pylori has a series of mechanisms that enable it to evade cell - mediated and cell - free immune killing . While the bacterium has been shown to be efﬁciently coated by antibodies in vitro and in vivo ( 72 , 141 ) , H . pylori also avoids antibody - dependent cell - mediated cyto - toxicity , complement ﬁxation , and the agglutinating effects of antibodies . Furthermore , the effector cells recruited to the site of infection are unable to clear the bacterium by the array of antioxidant compounds that can be deployed by H . pylori and by disturbed phagosome maturation . Blocking the develop - ment of a phagosome into a lethal compartment provides a protected niche for H . pylori in the inﬂamed gastric mucosa that could contribute to its long - term survival in the host .

There is evidence that H . pylori exerts control over the host vesicular machinery , but we do not fully understand how this is achieved . Components of H . pylori may sequester vesicular trafﬁcking machinery , act on global regulators of trafﬁcking and vesicular machinery , insert components into the phago - some membrane , or inﬂuence the phosphatidylinositol drivers of speciﬁc membrane interactions . A Strategy to Effect H . pylori Clearance by the Immune Response H . pylori vaccines have been unsuccessful in providing protec - tion in humans . The successful vaccination protocols developed in the mouse model are unsuitable for application in humans , as they require the use of cholera toxin or cholera toxin derivatives as adjuvants ( 136 ) . Importantly , the strong speciﬁc immune response that is already mounted in all infected persons merely directs H . pylori to immune effector cells , which are then unable to eliminate the internalized bacteria ( 75 ) . The current standard treatment regimens for H . pylori infec - tion are triple therapy ( incorporating amoxicillin and clarithro - mycin in combination with a proton pump inhibitor ) and quadruple therapy ( incorporating bismuth , tetracycline , metro - nidazole , and a proton pump inhibitor ) over 1 or 2 wk ( 93 ) . More complex and costly therapies have been developed for infections recalcitrant to treatment . However , quintuple ther - apy [ triple therapy plus lactoferrin and probiotics ( 43 , 156 ) ] , sequential triple - quadruple therapies , or therapies targeted by pretesting isolates for antibiotic sensitivity fail to address the underlying cause of increasing treatment failure , i . e . , increas - ing antibiotic resistance . Disruption of the bacterial factors responsible for seizing control of the eukaryotic phagosome maturation process could reinstate the efﬁcacy of the immune response and result in improved clearance of H . pylori infec - tions resistant to antibiotic therapy . This type of strategy is exempliﬁed by the targeting of nonreplicating populations of M . tuberculosis using rhodanine agents ( 32 , 98 ) . Recently , Hoy et al . ( 67 ) identiﬁed an H . pylori virulence factor important for bacterial invasion of the epithelia . High temperature require - ment A ( HtrA ) cleaves E - cadherin , disrupting cell - cell adhe - sion , promoting intercellular entry of H . pylori . Previously , proteolytic cleavage of E - cadherin was linked to the malignant progression of adenocarcinomas ( 35 , 44 ) . By using a virtual screening approach , Lower et al . ( 91 ) identiﬁed inhibitors of HtrA that may help prevent bacterial inﬁltration of the epithe - lium . Alternatively , a strategy to restore phagosome maturation could assist the host’s immune system to clear H . pylori infection . A concerted approach to eliminate the free - swim - ming bacteria in the mucous layer with antibiotics , targeted vaccination strategies that skew the adaptive immune response to an effective Th17 - mediated response , and improvement in the efﬁcacy of pathogen elimination by the phagocytic effector cells recruited by the inﬂammatory immune response could provide the multipronged attack that is clearly required to eliminate this persistent pathogen . For this novel strategy to be effective , the critical factors that H . pylori utilizes to disrupt the phagosome maturation process will need to be identiﬁed . Then speciﬁc drugs that target the H . pylori factors interfering with host trafﬁcking machinery could correct the phagosome mat - uration process and restore this integral part of the host’s immune system . Conclusion Survival within phagocytes is a key component of persistent H . pylori infection . Phagocytes may provide a protected niche within the inﬂamed mucosa and a reservoir for reinfection when the delicate balance between the proinﬂammatory and the tolerogenic responses swings to the more effective Th17 - mediated response shown to be critical for the reduction of bacterial load in immunized mice . H . pylori - mediated disrup - tion of phagosome maturation could also affect the nature of the inﬂammatory immune response , as dendritic cells , macro - phages , and neutrophils are the main controllers of the immune response in the gastric mucosa . Restoration of the normal process of phagosome maturation could therefore redirect the immune response to a more effective type of response . The key observation that H . pylori disrupts host cellular machinery and persists in the very effector cells recruited to eliminate it points to this process as being central to the long - term survival strategy of H . pylori . The decreasing efﬁcacy of H . pylori antibiotic treatment has important global signiﬁcance for health and disease , as gastric cancer cases that are attributable to H . pylori infection account for 63 . 4 % of stomach cancers , representing 5 . 5 % of all cancers worldwide ( 115 ) . Eliminating H . pylori and avoiding the onset of pathology would have profound consequences for public health , particularly in developing countries , where H . pylori infection is rife . In infected individuals , the immune response fails to clear H . pylori , despite directing it to phagocytic cells , which would normally kill bacteria . A better understanding of how phagocytosed H . pylori alters the critical process of phagosome maturation and circumvents the cell - mediated adaptive immune response will offer new avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention .
