Organization of Actin i n the Leading Edge of Cultured Cells : Influence of Osmium Tetroxide and Dehydration on the Ultrastructure of Actin Meshworks J . V . SMALL , with the technical assistance of G . LANGANGER Institute of Molecular Biology , Austrian Academy of Sciences , Salzburg , Austria ABSTRACT (cid:9) The ordered structure of the leading edge ( lamellipodium ) of cultured fibroblasts is readily revealed in cells extracted briefly in Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde mixtures , fixed further in glutaraldehyde , and then negatively stained for electron microscopy . By this proce - dure , the leading edge regions show a highly organised , three - dimensional network of actin filaments together with variable numbers of radiating actin filament bundles or microspikes . The use of Phalloidin after glutaraldehyde fixation resulted in a marginal improvement in filament order . Processing of the cytoskeletons through the additional steps generally employed for conven - tional electron microscopy resulted in a marked deterioration or complete disruption of the order of the actin filament networks . In contrast , the actin filaments of the stress fiber bundles were essentially unaffected . Thus , postfixation in osmium tetroxide ( 1 % for 7 min at room temperature ) transformed the networks to a reticulum of kinked fibers , resembling those produced by the exposure of muscle F - actin to OSOQ in vitro ( P . Maupin - Szamier and T . D . Pollard . 1978 . J . Cell Biol . 77 : 837 - 852 ) . While limited exposure to OSOQ ( 0 . 2 % for 20 min at 0°C ) obviated this destruction , dehydration in acetone or ethanol , with or without post - osmication , caused a further and unavoidable disordering and aggregation of the meshwork filaments . The meshwork regions of the leading edge then showed a striking resemblance to the networks hitherto described in critical point - dried preparations of cultured cells . I conclude that much of the " microtrabecular lattice " described by Wolosewick and Porter ( 1979 . J . Cell Biol . 82 : 114 - 139 ) in the latter preparations constitutes actin meshworks and actin filament arrays , with their associated components , that have been distorted and aggregated by the preparative procedures employed . While the presence of actin in the ordered bundles , or " stress fibers , " of cultured cells has been exhaustively documented ( 8 , 12 , 22 ) the other organizational states of this major cellular protein have been less well defined . This has been largely due to the lack of adequate procedures to preserve actin filaments in their more transitory , less stabilized assemblies within the cell . For substrate - attached cultured cells , an example of such an assemblage of actin can be found in the motile and normally convex - shaped regions of the cell periphery generally referred to as the " leading edge " or lamellipodium ( 1 , 21 ) . Earlier electron microscopy studies of embedded material had indi - cated the presence ofa net of " microffaments " in such regions ( 8 , 35 ) but , because of the lack of structural order , little insight could be gained into the role played by the filaments in cell THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 91 DECEMBER 1981 695 - 705 ©The Rockefeller University Press - 0021 - 9525 / 81 / 12 / 0695 / 11 $ 1 . 00 motility . In the course of investigations of the organization of cyto - plasmic filaments within cultured cells , I and my colleagues ( 32 , 33 , 34 ) , as well as others ( 7 , 18 , 27 ) , have developed techniques using detergent extraction to visualize the intracel - lular filament systems directly in the electron microscope . We were able to demonstrate that under appropriate conditions , namely using a balanced salt solution buffered at low pH ( close to 6 . 0 ) and with added EGTA and Mgt ' , a well - defined network of actin filaments is preserved within the region cor - responding to the leading edge . The breadth and contours of the meshwork correlated with images obtained in the fluores - cence microscope of a band of material at the leading edge reacting with antibodies to actin ( see e . g . , reference 23 ) . In 695 further studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of loco - motion ofvertebrate cells , we have been analysing the structure and composition of the leading edge region in more detail . At the same time , it has become apparent that the adequate preservation of the complex assemblies of actin in this region are very susceptible to the preparative procedures employed . In particular , we were concerned that in cells prepared by the critical point - drying procedure little trace remained of the highly ordered networks seen after detergent extraction , glu - taraldehyde fixation , and negative staining . By analysing the structure of the leading edge after each of the steps normally used before critical point - drying , or indeed before conventional plastic embedding , we have been able to show where the distortions arise . The data , which confirm and extend the findings of Maupin - Szamier and Pollard ( 25 ) on purified muscle F - actin , show that osmium tetroxide as a postfixative has a primary destructive effect on actin within the leading edge , even in the presence of actin accessory proteins such as filamin and a - actinin . The mushroom toxin Phalloidin ( 39 ) , used after glutaraldehyde fixation , produced a marginal improvement in the order ofthe negatively stained actin mesh - works and also provided partial stabilisation against osmium tetroxide . However , further and unavoidable aggregation and distortion resulted from dehydration in organic solvents and was thus always reflected in the critical point - dried prepara - tions . In short , ordered actin networks as seen after glutaral - dehyde fixation were converted , after dehydration and critical point - drying , into irregular fibrous lattices reminiscent of the " microtrabecular lattice " described by Wolosewick and Porter ( 41 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells Embryonic chick fibroblasts were obtained by trypsinisation of hearts from 14 - to 16 - d embryos and grown at 37°C in Earle ' s minimal essential medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and in the presence of 5 % C02 . For electron microscopy , thecells , taken after the second to fourth plating , were grown on Parlodion - carbon or Formvar - coated silver or gold hexagonal support grids ( 150 - mesh ; Teepe Brandsma , Holland ) andused after 12 - 48 h . Preparation of Triton X - 100 - Glutaraldehyde Cytoskeletons Cytoskeletons were prepared using mixtures of Triton X - 100 andglutaralde - hyde ( 18 ) in abuffer system described previously ( 32 ) and to which we shall refer as °cytoskeleton buffer . " This buffer corresponds to a Hanks balanced salt solution lacking Ca ' , with added Mg and EGTA and with the pH reduced to - 6 . 1 . The components were : NaCl , 137 mM ; KCI , 5 mM ; Na2HP04 , 1 . 1 mM ; KH2P04 , 0 . 4 mM ; NaHCO3 , 4 mM ; glucose , 5 . 5 MM ; MgC12 , 2mM ; EGTA , 2 mM ; PIPES , 5mM ; pH 6 . 0 - 6 . 1 . For this study , the Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde mixture consisted of 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde . Extraction - fixation wascarried outwith room temperature solutions in the following way : The grids carrying the cells wereremoved from theculturetube , washed brieflyinTris - bufferedsaline ( TBS ) , followed by cytoskeleton buffer , and then transferred to the Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde mixture for 1 min . After abriefwash in cytoskeleton buffer the grids were stored on the cover slips in the same buffer containing 2 . 5 % glutaral - dehyde , before negative staining or further processingfor electron microscopy . In some cases , a passage through 2x 10 - 5 MPhalloidin ( a gift from Th . Wieland , MaxPlanck Institute ) in the same buffer ( 2 min ) preceded the second fixation in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde . 050 4 Postfixation and Dehydration To test the effect of OsO4 , glutaraldehyde - fixed cytoskeletons were prepared as described above and then treated with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer for 15 minat room temperature . This additional Triton X - 100 treatment was found necessary to allow final penetration ofthe negative stain after OS0 4 ; 696 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL Of CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 91 , 1981 it hadnovisible effecton the orderoffilaments seen afterglutaraldehyde fixation . Postfixation wasthen performedin 1 % OS04 in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for5 - 15 minat roomtemperature or in0 . 2 - 1 % OSOa in 0 . 1 Msodium phosphate - buffer , pH 6 . 3 ( 2 , 25 , 36 ) , for20 minat 0°C . After washingin cytoskeleton buffer , negative staining was performed in 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate , as described below . The dehydration of cytoskeletons fixed as described above was performed with Formvar - coated grids using agraded series , 15 - 100 % , ofalcohol or acetone andatotal passage time of 10 - 20 minat room temperature . Thegrids were then negatively stained in 1 % uranyl acetate in 100 % methanol or , alternatively , rehydrated through the same series and stained in aqueousuranyl acetate . Negative Staining and Critical Point - drying Negative staining with uranyl acetate was carried out either in thecold using a 1 % aqueous solution , as described previously ( 32 ) , or at room temperature , using asolution of 1 . 030 uranyl acetate in 100 % methanol . Forthe latter staining , grids were immersed in the stain solution for 30 s , drained of excess stain with filter paper , and air - dried . Staining in sodium silicotungstate ( 18 , 38 ) wascarried out at roomtemperature as follows : Grids were rinsed two times in water and transferred sequentially through 4drops ofbacitracin ( 40pg / mlin water ; SigmaChemicalCo . , St . Louis , Mo . ; 13 ) in aplastic petri dish anddrained briefly on the edge with filter paper ; they were then passed through 4drops of3 % sodium silicotungstate andfinally drained of excess stain and allowed to dry . A stain combination was also employed which involved positive staining ( immersion ) in 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate followed by rinsing in water and negative staining in sodium silicotung - state . Criticalpoint - drying inC02wascarried out afterrapiddehydration in acetone in a Balers critical point - drying apparatus ( Baleers , Liechtenstein ) . RESULTS Organization of the Leading Edge after Glutaraldehyde Fixation The general appearance of a heart fibroblast extracted in a mixture of 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde and negatively stained in aqueous uranyl acetate is shown in Fig . 1 a . Fig . 1 b shows a cell extracted in the same way butprocessed through acetone and critical point - dried . The broad band occurring at the convex region of the cells and corresponding to the leading edge is clearly defined and is shown at higher magnification in Fig . 1 c . As shown previously ( 32 , 33 ) this band characteristically exhibits a criss - cross network of actin filaments together with variable numbers of radiating filament bundles , or microspikes . The organization ofthe filaments as seen with two different staining procedures is shown in Figs . 2 a and b . The micro - graphs have been chosen to show the dense packing of actin filaments within the filament meshworks as well as the nature of the microspike bundles . Filaments within the meshwork commonly converge in groups onto sites containing extra ma - terial at the cell periphery ( see also references 18 , 33 , 34 ) and are , in other situations , seen to merge into the microspike bundles of actin filaments ( Figs . 2a and 3 a and b ) . This arrangement of filaments is seen not only in the leading edge of heart fibroblasts but is characteristic for the corresponding regions in various other cultured cell types so far investigated ( 18 , 31 - 33 ) . The images suggest that the microspikes form via a coalescence of the meshwork filaments and that the reverse process , the divergence of bundles into meshworks , may also occur . The diameter of the filament bundles ranges from - 0 . 1 tLm to 0 . 24 tin and the number of visualized actin filaments within them from - 13 to 30 . A better idea of the total number offilaments in the bundles may be obtained in situations where the bundles splay apart at their base , towards the rear of the leading edge ; in these regions , up to as many as 40 filaments may be counted .

Cytoskeletons treated after the initial Triton X - 100 - glutar - aldehyde mixture with phalloidin ( in cytoskeleton buffer ) con - sistently exhibited particularly well - ordered filament networks in the leading edge ( Figs . 2 a and 3 a and b ) , suggesting that this toxin may partly stabilize the actin filaments against any disordering that occurs during drying of the stain . That phal - loidin binds to the glutaraldehyde - fixed cytoskeletons was shown by separate experiments ( 34 ) using fluorescently - labeled phalloidin ( 43 ) . The observation of stereo pairs demonstrated the existence of a considerable degree of three - dimensional order in the negatively stained preparations ( Fig . 3 a and b ) . Within the meshwork regions the filaments could be seen to be extensively interconnected and extra globular material was present on the l . V .

In favorable situations the helical substructure of actin was also evident , being most clear in the microspike bundles ( Fig . 2 c ) . Fig . 3 c has been included to illustrate the appearance of the other filaments , the microtubules , and 10 - nm filaments that occur with actin in regions behind the leading edge and gen - FIGURE 3 (cid:9) a and b , stereo pair of leading edge region ( prepared as Fig . 2 a ) illustrating the three - dimensional nature of the actin meshworks and microspikes .

The penetration of some microtubules into the leading edge and occasionally along the filament bundles was also observed ( data not shown ) . Effect of OS04 Postfixation After postfixation of glutaraldehyde - fixed cytoskeletons in 1 % OS04 for 7 min at room temperature and negative staining in aqueous uranyl acetate , little trace of the regular organiza - tion of filaments within the leading edge remained ( Fig . 4 a ) . Rather than appearing as a criss - crossing net of linear fila - ments , the leading edge region presented itself more as a reticulum of short irregular fibers . This appearance of the net could be attributed mainly to a kinking of the filaments , recognised most easily in the filament bundles ( microspikes ) within the meshwork . As might have been expected from earlier electron microscope studies of section material ( 8 , 35 ) , such a kinking effect was not evident in the filaments of the stress fibers ( Fig . 4c ) . After the earlier reports which indicated that brief OS04 treatment in the cold is less damaging to F - actin ( 2 , 25 , 36 ) , we determined the limiting concentration of OS04 , used for 20 min at 0°C , that leads to visible morphological changes in actin at the leading edge . With postfixation in 0 . 2 % OS04 , actin within the meshwork as well as in the microspikes appeared essentially as in the glutaraldehyde - fixed controls except for an apparent change in contrast ( Fig . 4b ) . Increasing the OS04 concentration above - 0 . 4 % produced a noticeable distortion of actin and with 0 . 8 % OS04 this distortion was nearly as extensive as with 1 % OS04 used at room temperature . Since previous studies have indicated the absence of tropo - myosin in the leading edge ( 23 ) as well as the stabilizing effect , under certain conditions , of this protein against the destruction of muscle actin by OS04 ( 25 ) , it was of interest to test to what extent tropomyosin may stabilize the leading edge filaments against OS04 postfixation . For these experiments muscle tro - pomyosin was added to unfixed cytoskeletons , suitably pro - duced by extraction of the living cells in 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer for 30 s . The incubation of these cytoske - letons in 1 mg / ml skeletal muscle tropomyosin for 2 min ( room temperature , cytoskeleton buffer ) , followed by washing in buffer and processing in the Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde mix - ture for 40 s , gave leading - edge regions in which the actin filaments of the meshwork were well preserved and defined with particular clarity . However , in preparations postfixed with OS04 ( 1 % for 10 min at room temperature ) , the network was disrupted and resembled that seen with the preparations not treated with tropomyosin . Effects of Dehydration and Critical Point - drying To trace the changes that occurred during the dehydration step , negative staining following acetone or alcohol dehydra - tion was performed using a dehydrating agent as solvent for the stain . Tests showed methanol to be rather suitable in this respect ; uranyl acetate is readily solubilised in this solvent and the resulting staining was adequate and reproducible . Fig . 5 a shows the result obtained with cells extracted with the Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde mixture , fixed in 2 . 5 % glutar - aldehyde for 15 min , dehydrated in acetone , and stained in methanol - uranyl acetate . A noticeable distortion in the fila - ment net has occurred ; the filaments are more variable in thickness ( measured range of diameters 6 . 8 - 17 . 0 rum ) and relatively few filaments may be counted in the microspike bundles . The circular inset in this figure shows , for comparison , 70O (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 91 , 1981 the dimensions of the " intact " network , as seen in the cyto - skeletons , after glutaraldehyde fixation . In an alternative ap - proach , dehydrated specimens were rehydrated and stained in aqueous uranyl acetate ( Fig . 5 b ) . Again , a considerable rear - rangement and aggregation of the actin filament net was evident . In this example ( Fig . 5 b ) the cytoskeleton was fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by OS04 ( 1 % , 7 min , room tempera - ture ) before dehydration . For cytoskeletons fixed in glutaral - dehyde alone , the effect was similar but with the result that the fibers were somewhat more regular in diameter with fewer constrictions . Phalloidin , used after Triton X - 100 - glutaralde - hyde treatment , did not protect the actin meshworks against these distortions arising from dehydration , although a some - what lesser aggregation of the meshwork filaments was appar - ent ( Fig . 5 c ) . Leading edge regions of Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde cyto - skeletons that were critical point - dried after dehydration in acetone are shown in Fig . 6 . The lattice observed and typical of that described by Wolosewick and Porter ( 41 ) resembles in its general morphology the image seen after dehydration . Again , the inset shows the level of detail seen in cytoskeletons prepared as for Fig . 2a to illustrate the loss of structural order that has occurred . In the critical point - dried preparations the difference between cells treated for different times in OS04 was not significant , presumably due to the overriding changes that took place during the dehydration step . DISCUSSION Cytoskeletal Preparations It is appropriate to comment first on the relation of the filament organization of the cytoskeletons with that of the " intact " cell . In earlier studies we extracted cells briefly in Triton X - 100 alone , before glutaraldehyde fixation ( 32 , 33 ) . Under these conditions it could be established , for HeLa cells , that - 500 1o of the total actin was lost in the supernate , accom - panied by ^ - 70 % of the tubulin ( a and / 3 ) and 60 % of the a - actinin ( 6 ) . According to other studies ( 4 , 5 , 17 ; see also review article 24 , 37 ) , a high proportion of the released actin is likely to be in an unpolymerised form , although the ratios between monomeric and polymeric actin must clearly depend on the conditions employed ( on the presence or absence of calcium , on actin - associated proteins , etc . ) . The addition of glutaralde - hyde to our extraction buffer , a modification introduced by Hoglund et al . ( 18 ) , resulted , with heart fibroblasts , in a denser packing of filaments in the leading edge , suggesting that the loss of pre - existing F - actin had been mainly prevented . In a parallel study , it has been demonstrated further that such Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde mixtures produce an immediate cessation of motile activity of the leading edge of chick heart fibroblasts with no detectable retraction , at least at the limit of resolution of the light microscope ( 34 ) . The structural arrange - ments observed thus bear a real relation to the phases of movement of the leading lamella . We cannot now rule out the possible release of some fila - ments from the dorsal surface of the leading edge during " fixation - extraction " , but consider that this may be minimal . Thus , with the use of lower Triton X - 100 concentrations for which the contours ofthe membrane delimiting the edge of the cell could still be observed , the density offilament packing was not noticeably greater . Nevertheless , the removal of at least a submembranous layer could be inferred from the loss of the microvilli that project upwards from the dorsal cell surface . Some actin binding proteins must also inevitably be lost , but FIGURE 4 (cid:9) Effect of OS04 postfixation on actin filaments in the leading edge and the stress fibers of Triton X - 100 - glutaraldehyde cytoskeletons . a , leading edge region exposed to 1 % OsO4 for 7 min at room temperature and stained in aqueous uranyl acetate . c , stress fiber in similarly treated cell .

Although the order in the current preparations might be expected to be modified by a flattening during drying in the negative stain , we have shown in fact that a good degree of three - dimensional order is retained ( see also 34 ) . Presumably , the leading edge networks are cross - linked to such an extent as to resist collapse onto the support film . Effects of Chemical Fixation on Cytoplasmic Actin For technical reasons the leading edge of cultured cells and likewise the spreading zones shown by other cells when at - tached to solid substrates ( 1 , 3 , 10 , 14 , 28 ) are ideal subjects for the structural investigations ofactin meshworks and the factors that affect their preservation . These thin , broad zones of actin filaments , sandwiched only by the plasmalemma , are readily accessible to study in toto by diverse electron microscope techniques , using conventional accelerating voltages . In considering the problems related to the preservation of actin filaments we can turn first to the long experience of the investigators of muscle fine structure . Their x - ray studies have shown that the integrity of the thin filament , ofthe packing of actin monomers in the double helix , is disturbed neither by detergent extraction nor by chemical fixation in glutaraldehyde ( 20 , 29 , 42 ) . Indeed , glutaraldehyde - fixed actin is still capable of activating the ATPase activity of muscle myosin ( 26 ) . Re - lated studies have also established the negative staining method as the most suitable for revealing the fine structure of actin filaments in the electron microscope ( 15 , 19 ) . Osmium tetroxide , on the other hand , when used as a postfixative produces a loss of the fine structure of sarcomeric actin ( 20 , 30 ) , although the orientation of the filaments is maintained within the myofibril . The filaments of the stress fibers of nonmuscle cells show a similar resistance to total disruption by OS04 by maintaining their linearity . Perhaps for this reason alone many authors have been led to assume that actin elsewhere in the cell would be equally well preserved . But , as we show here , the difference in sensitivity to OS04 of the filaments in the stress fibers and those existing in the peripheral lamellae is dramatic . Exposure to 1 % OS04 after glutaraldehyde fixation for shorter times than generally em - ployed for conventional electron microscopy ( 5 - 10 min ) results in a more or less total destruction of free actin filaments and actin meshworks . The distortion and kinking of the filaments that is observed corresponds almost exactly to that seen with purified muscle actin treated similarly in vitro ( 25 ) . Dehydration , Critical Point - drying , and the Microtrabecular Lattice in the Leading Edge As we have seen , dehydration in organic solvents has a further deleterious effect on the morphology of the leading edge meshwork , causing additional distortions and a thickening or aggregation of the filaments . It is particularly noteworthy that rather few filaments , up to - 8 or 10 , may be counted in the microspikes of dehydrated and critical point - dried cells ( 9 and this study ) compared with a maximum of 30 - 40 filaments J . V . SMALL (cid:9) Actin Meshworks in Cultured Cells (cid:9) 703 as seen after glutaraldehyde fixation and negative staining . From their studies with freeze - dried cytoskeletons , Heuser and Kirschner ( 16 ) cite a similar aggregation process occurring as a result of dehydration after glutaraldehyde fixation . These latter authors also used 10 % methanol as a routine cryoprotec - tant , which prompted us to check whetherin fact some changes already occur even at this low methanol concentration and which might have been overlooked . In a preliminary test , no gross distortions could be detected in the order of leading edge meshworks when 10 % methanol was included in the negative - staining solutions . From the close identity of the negatively stained images obtained at the end of the dehydration series and after critical point - drying we conclude that the critical point - drying step itself introduces no additional distortions of the actin meshwork . Wolosewick and Porter ( 41 ) have recently considered at length the relation that their microtrabecular lattice observed in critical point - dried cells may bear to the organization of the cytoplasm in vivo . The microtrabecular lattice is an irregular , three - dimensional filamentous net , taken to represent the " cy - toplasmic ground substance , " that embraces and interconnects the cell organelles and membranous components and extends into the peripheral cytoplasmic regions ( 9 , 40 , 41 ) . In the latter peripheral lamellae that are engaged in motile activity this lattice and the microspike bundles are the only structural components recognised ( 9 ) . Since it is now clear that ordered actin meshworks exist in such regions , we cannot escape the conclusion that the microtrabecular lattice , at least in these peripheral zones , is in large part the distorted remains of pre - existing , organised actin filaments . Additional components may exist in the complete lattice that are lost during detergent extraction , but even so , our own data on critical point - dried whole cells and cytoskeletons revealed little difference in ap - pearance between the elements seen after critical point - drying in the two types of preparations . Ofthe lattice in the remaining part of the cytoplasm we can only infer that much of this may also be a distorted form of filamentous actin , together with the 10 - nm filaments and filament - associated proteins ( see also 16 ) . We would thus endorse the conclusion of Wolosewick and Porter ( 41 ) that the images hitherto obtained by the critical point method probably correspond closely to those derived from plastic - embedded material . But in contrast to their view we conclude that the actin filament meshworks in both types of preparations are largely destroyed . This destruction results from the postfixation in 0804 , as could be predicted from earlier work ( 25 ) , and also from the dehydration in organic solvents . Wolosewick and Porter ( 41 ) did note a " decay " in the lattice when OS04 was used as a primary fixative , but failed to detect any changes resulting from postfixation in 0804 after glutaraldehyde . From these studies I conclude that these changes were masked in part by the additional distortions caused by dehydration . Future Studies of Actin Meshworks Since OS04 has long been recognized as a useful postfixative for conventional electron microscopy ( see reference 41 ) , 1 attempted , as did Maupin - Szamier and Pollard ( 25 ) with iso - lated F - actin , to establish the concentrations and exposures tolerated by the cytoplasmic actin meshworks . As I indicated , treatment with a 0 . 2 % solution ( pH , 6 , 2 phosphate buffer ) at 0°C for 20 min had no visible destructive effect . Thus , for studies where the cell in its entirety must be observed , the desirability of using such limited exposure to OS04 should not 704 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 91 , 1981 be overlooked . Needless to say , improvements beyond this will be required for preserving order in embedded or critical point - dried specimens . Scope in this direction may be offered by the use of phalloidin ( 39 ) to stabilize actin filaments against OS04 ( 11 ) and combining this with the glutaraldehyde - tannic acid procedure described by Begg et al . ( 2 ) . But , as these results show , the most difficult barrier to surmount is clearly the dehydration step . One may only suggest that for studies aimed at resolving this problem , the actin meshworks of substrate - attached cells offer themselves as a useful test system . For further studies ofthe thin regions of cultured cell cyto - skeletons , the use of glutaraldehyde - detergent mixtures fol - lowed by negative staining offers some obvious advantages which have yet to be fully exploited . It is now of particular interest to establish how the structure seen after negative staining compares with that observed in the same cytoskeletons prepared by the freeze - drying - replication method of Heuser and Kirschner ( 16 ) . The use of either or both of these methods should now open the way for detailed analysis of the structural interrelationships that occur between actin - associated proteins and cytoplasmic actin and which form the basis of actin - mediated phenomena in the cell .
