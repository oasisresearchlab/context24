During cell spreading , mammalian cells migrate using lamel - lipodia formed from a large dense branched actin network which produces the protrusive force required for leading edge advancement . The formation of lamellipodia is a dynamic process andisdependentonavarietyofproteincofactorsthatmediatetheirlocalregulation , structural characteristics and dynamics . In the present study , we show that mRNAs encoding some structural and regulatory components of the WAVE [ WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) verprolin homologous ] complex are localized to the leading edge of the cell and associated with sites of active translation . Furthermore , we demonstrate that steady - state levels of ArpC2 and Rac1 proteins increase at the leading edge during cell spreading , suggesting that localized protein synthesis has a pivotal role in controlling cell spreading and migration .

INTRODUCTION Fibroblasts are highly migratory mesenchymal cells that mediate formation and remodelling of epithelial tissues and wound healing . As such , ﬁbroblasts are key determinants in the outcomes of tumour progression and therefore a signiﬁcant target in the development of new cancer therapies [ 1 ] . The directional chemotaxis of mesenchymal cells can be initiated by various extracellular biochemical stimuli which include growth factors and chemokines ; however , cell migration and direction can also be inﬂuenced by mechanical forces and adhesion to ECM ( extracellular matrix ) proteins in what still remains a poorly understood process [ 2 ] . The mechanism of cell migration towards external attractants comprises a cycle in which cells are stimulated to polarize by the actions of Rho GTPases [ 3 ] and extend protrusions formed of large broad lamellipodia , or narrow elongate ﬁlopodia , both of which are driven and formed of ﬁlamentous actin networks [ 3 , 4 ] . These protrusions are then stabilized by focal adhesions that link the actin cytoskeleton to the ECM [ 2 ] . Such lamellipodia are large ﬂattened structures formed from the large dense branched actin networks , and cells migrating on to a 2D ( two - dimensional ) substrate often form a spatulate or fan - like morphology with the broad lamellipodium on the leading edge tapering to the trailing edge of the cell [ 4 , 5 ] . Elongation of the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments in lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia are hypothesized to produce the protrusive force required for the leading edge advancement observed during cell migration [ 6 ] . Formation of lamellipodia is therefore dependent on a variety of protein cofactors that mediate their local regulation , structural characteristics and dynamics [ 7 ] . These include the Rho family GTPase Rac1 , which stimulates the recruitment of the WAVE complex to the plasma membrane [ 8 ] , the constituent factors of the WAVE complex itself [ 9 ] , and the actin nucleation Arp2 / 3 complex ( actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ) , including Arp2 / 3 subunits that promote branched actin nucleation such as ArpC2 [ 7 ] . Arp2 / 3 consists of a stable complex comprising seven polypeptides ; the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits ( that share homology with actin ) form a pseudo actin dimer that nucleates actin when in a conformation that is dependent on the presence of further ArpC2 / ArpC3 subunits as well as ArpC4 and ArpC5 subunits [ 10 ] . However , Arp2 / 3 is not sufﬁcient to nucleate branched actin alone [ 11 ] . Formation of actin structures is regulated by WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) family proteins , which consist of two principal classes , WASP and WAVE ( WASP verprolin homologous ) proteins , both of which activate Arp2 / 3 to nucleate new actin ﬁlaments [ 12 ] . WAVE proteins form the scaffold for the WAVE complex , which is composed of ﬁve subunits and is required for lamellipodium formation , activated downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 . Cell signalling cascades and actinomyosin - dependent contractility promote the disassembly of adhesion at the trailing edge of the cell , and this allows the cell to progress forward [ 13 ] . It is known that the localization of mRNA into speciﬁc subcellular compartments is required for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity [ 14 ] , and the localization of actin mRNA itself has been fairly well characterized [ 15 – 17 ] . Actin mRNA is transported along ﬁlamentous actin within the cell by ZBP1 ( Zipcode - binding protein - 1 ) which binds to a ‘Zipcode’ comprising bipartite RNA elements in the 3 (cid:2) UTR ( untranslated region ) of β - actin mRNA [ 15 , 16 ] . This localization has been shown to affect the density of dendritic ﬁlopodia and ﬁlopodia synapses [ 17 ] . Moreover , it has been demonstrated previously that all seven constituent mRNAs of the Arp2 / 3 complex are Abbreviations used : Arp2 / 3 complex , actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ; BFA , Brefeldin A ; Cdc42 , cell division cycle 42 ; DIG , digoxigenin ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; ECM , extracellular matrix ; eIF , eukaryotic initiation factor ; 4E - BP , eIF4E - binding protein ; FISH , ﬂuorescence insituhybridization ; FMRP , fragile X mental retardation protein ; IF , immunoﬂuorescence ; IRSp53 , insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ; mTOR , mammalian target of rapamycin ; mTORC1 , mTOR complex 1 ; p70 RSK , p70 ribosomal S6 kinase ; PIP5K1a , PtdIns4P 5 - kinase type - 1 α ; QPCR , quantitative PCR ; RNAi , RNA interference ; rpS6 , ribosomal protein S6 ; siRNA , small interfering RNA ; UTR , untranslated region ; WASP , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ; WAVE , WASP verprolin homologous ; ZBP1 , Zipcode - binding protein - 1 . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed ( email s . j . morley @ sussex . ac . uk ) . c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2013 Biochemical Society 46 M . Willett and others compartmentalized to protrusions in ﬁbroblasts , although it is unclear as to the nature of the protrusions , or whether they involved active protein synthesis [ 18 ] . Protein synthesis is carried out in three stages ( initiation , elongation and termination ) , with the initiation stage of translation generally accepted as a major site of regulation of gene expression [ 19 – 24 ] . This pivotal role reﬂects the regulated binding of mRNA to the ribosome , facilitated by the assembly of eIFs ( eukaryotic initiation factors ) into a multiprotein complex known as eIF4F ( eIF4E , eIF4A and eIF4G ) which is often unregulated in tumour cells . In turn , the activity of this complex is regulated by both phosphorylation and the inherent structural properties of the recruited mRNA [ 19 , 20 , 22 ] . The formation of the eIF4F complex reﬂects the regulated availability of eIF4E to participate in initiation , a process controlled by a number of general and mRNA - speciﬁc regulatory proteins . Using a conserved motif , 4E - BPs ( eIF4E - binding proteins ) compete with eIF4G for a common surface on eIF4E and inhibit eIF4F assembly . The localized association of 4E - BPs with eIF4E is acutely modulated by multisite phosphorylation dependent on mTORC1 [ mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) complex 1 ] signalling [ 21 , 23 ] , effectively integrating signals from mitogens and nutrients with the translational apparatus [ 23 , 24 ] . mTORC1 inhibition has been demonstrated to inhibit adhesion and invasiveness of prostate cancercells , andﬁbronectin - inducedmigrationofahumanarterial smooth muscle line , among others [ 25 , 26 ] . We have demonstrated previously that translation initiation factors localize to the leading edge of migrating ﬁbroblasts in loci enriched with actively translating ribosomes [ 27 ] . Furthermore , we also demonstrated that ribosomes co - localize with nascent focal adhesions in spreading cells in a cell - matrix - dependent manner [ 28 ] . In the present study , using human lung ﬁbroblasts , we extend the work to examine the localization of mRNA encoding both structural and regulatory components of the WAVE complex , key components in the formation of branched actin during lamellipodia formation and cytoskeleton remodelling . We have also used puromycilation [ 27 ] to demonstrate that these mRNAs co - localize to lamellipodial - located foci where active protein synthesis is taking place in polarized and migrating cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue culture SV40 ( simian virus 40 ) transformed MRC5 human lung ﬁbro - blasts , were cultured in 10 - cm plates in MEM ( minimum essential medium ) - GlutaMAX TM ( Gibco ® ) supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( PAA Laboratories ) at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 as described previously [ 27 ] . Preparation of cell extracts Following treatment , cells were isolated and extracts prepared as described previously [ 27 – 29 ] .

WAVE1 was a mixture of 48 single - labelled probes ( 20 - mers ) conjugated to CAL Fluor Orange 560 [ as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( Biosearch Technologies ) ] . The probe ( 1 μ l containing 50 ng ) was mixed with 1 μ l of salmon sperm DNA ( 10 μ g / μ l ; Boehringer ) and 1 μ l of yeast tRNA ( 10 μ g / μ l ; Sigma ) per sample . Two volumes of 100 % ethanol were then added and the mixture was freeze - dried to dryness .

Slides were then dehydrated with sequential 5 min incubations of 80 , 95 and 100 % ethanol , and then desiccated completely on a hot - block at 42 ◦ C . The probe / hybridization mixture per sample was pipetted ( 10 μ l ) on to dehydrated slides , and each sample was overlaid with a 22 - mm 2 glass coverslip edge - coated with silicone sealant , and then incubated at 64 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed environment for 1 h . Coverslips were removed with a razor blade and the slides were washed three times at 64 ◦ C for 5 min in 1 × SSC , containing the same percentage formamide as the hybridization buffer .

RESULTS Inhibition of protein synthesis or vesicle transport decreases lamellipodia formation in ﬁbroblasts In ﬁbroblastic cells , Src family kinases play an essential role in integrin adhesive function and focal adhesion structures [ 31 ] . This serves to establish and maintain the mechano - tension necessary for the stabilization and recruitment of new subunits to assembled focal adhesions [ 32 ] . Previously , we have shown the association of translation initiation factors and ribosomes with subcellular membranes , with ﬁbroblastic cell spreading sensitive to inhibition of intracellular vesicle transport by BFA ( Brefeldin A ) [ 27 ] . As focal adhesion integrity is essential for the maintenance of cell protrusions such as lamellipodia [ 2 ] , we have used the Src inhibitor Src1 - I to disassemble these structures in fully spread polarized cells ( Figure 1 ) . To monitor the assembly of focal adhesions , cellsweresubsequentlyreleasedfromSrcinhibitionby replenishment with replacement growth media , in the absence or presenceofemetine ( aninhibitoroftranslationelongation ) orBFA and visualized by IF . As shown in Figure 1 , treatment of cells with Src1 - I resulted in the withdrawal of lamellipodium - like structures ( Figure 1B compared with Figure 1A ) . However , release of cells into complete growth medium resulted in the rapid formation of new focal adhesions and lamellipodia ( Figure 1C compared with Figure 1B ) . Using this model system of cell release into either BFA which interferes with vesicle transport ( Figure 1E ) or emetine at a level which inhibits protein synthesis ( Figure 1D ) , resulted in a failure to assemble new lamellipodial structures . c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2013 Biochemical Society 48 M . Willett and others Figure 1 Inhibition of protein synthesis prevents lamellipodia formation in MRC5 ﬁbroblasts Cells were either untreated ( A ) , or induced to disassemble their lamellipodia by treatment for 16h with 20 μ M Src inhibitor , Src1 - I ( B ) . Cells were then released for 30min into complete growthmediacontainingnoinhibitor ( C ) , 20 μ Memetine ( D ) or5 μ g / mlBFA ( E ) . Asdescribed and using confocal microscopy , phalloidin - TRITC ( tetramethylrhodamine β - isothiocyanate ) conjugate ( red ) was used as a marker for actin and paxillin / Alexa Fluor ® 488 ( green ) was used as a marker for focal adhesions . Inhibition of mTOR signalling affects cell migration velocity and distance The association of 4E - BPs with eIF4E is acutely modulated by multisite phosphorylation dependent on mTORC1 signalling [ 19 – 24 ] , with mTORC1 inhibition shown previously to inhibit protein synthesis [ 33 – 35 ] , adhesion , invasiveness and migration of human cells [ 25 , 26 ] . The rapamycin analogue RAD001 ( everolimus ) inhibits the mTORC1 complex with a high degree of speciﬁcity , thus leading to translation inhibition via 4E - BP1 dephosphorylation [ 36 ] . The mTOR catalytic site inhibitor , Ku - 0063794 , inhibits translation more efﬁciently than RAD001 [ 37 ] , which might reﬂect that Ku - 0063794 also affects mTORC2 activity [ 23 , 24 ] . To investigate the effect of inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC1 / 2 on migrating cells , cells were seeded on to Boyden chambers , starved of growth factors for 2 h , and then allowed to migrate in the absence or presence of a growth factor gradient supplied by fetal bovine serum . Individual cells were also spatially tracked over 20 h in the presence of 10 μ M RAD001 or Ku - 0063794 , as indicated , concentrations that inhibited mTORC1 [ 36 ] or mTORC1 / 2 signalling [ 37 ] respectively , and impaired protein synthesis ( results not shown ) . The resulting data were analysed statistically ( n = 25 ) ( Figure 2A ) showing that inhibition of mTORC1 signalling ( and protein synthesis ) had a profound effect on cell movement . The mean square displacement of the data ( Figure 2B ) indicate that the directional movement of cells incubated with Ku - 0063794 ( × ) or RAD001 ( (cid:2) ) were equally inhibited when compared with cells incubated with chemo - attractant only ( (cid:3) ) . This inhibition of movement was observed from the earliest times investigated , was consistent throughout the time course ( i . e . not due to a general long - term inhibition of mTORC2 ) , and similar to that observed following release of arrested cells into emetine ( Figure 1 , and see Figure 5C later ) . Relative to control cells , there was a signiﬁcant impairment of migration velocity ( distance travelled / time ) for both the Ku - 0063794 - and RAD001 - treated cells ( Figure 2C ) . These data are consistent with the approximately equal reduction observed in both accumulated ( Figure 2D ) and Euclidean migration distances ( Figure 2E ) following inhibition of mTOR signalling and protein synthesis . Interestingly , migration straightness ( accumulated distance / Euclidean distance ) was signiﬁcantly higher for the inhibitor - treated cells , suggesting a role for mTOR / protein synthesis in steering / directionality during ﬁbroblast migration ( Figure 2F ) . As RAD001 - inhibited cell migration to the same extent as Ku - 0063794 - treated cells , these data indicate mTORC1 , but not mTORC2 , as a central player in controlling cell migration and steering . Although mTORC1 is well known to regulate protein synthesis , given its multiple roles in cell function , other processes downstream of mTORC1 may also be involved here . Inhibition of mTORC1 results in an impairment of wound healing and lamellipodium morphology To further investigate the effect of inhibition of mTOR signalling onﬁbroblastmigrationandlamellipodiummorphology , cellswere grown to a conﬂuent monolayer which was then wounded by scratching with a micropipette tip . The cells were allowed to migrate into the wound without ( Figure 3A , upper panels ) or with inhibition of mTORC1 / 2 signalling ( and protein synthesis [ 37 ] ) using either Ku - 0063794 ( Figure 3A , lower panels ) , or with inhibition of mTORC1 using RAD001 ( Figure 3B ) . Individual cell migration was tracked , and the area of the wounds covered after 20 h of cell migration was quantiﬁed using ROIs ( region of interest ) created with MBF ImageJ . In cells where protein synthesis was inhibited ( in the presence of Ku - 0063794 [ 37 ] ) , they failed to form lamellipodia when migrating into the wound ; instead , the cells exhibited an irregular morphology ( Figure 3A , lower panels ) , and only achieved 40 % of the wound coverage of the untreated cells ( Figure 3B ) . In agreement with the data shown in Figure 2 , less migration was observed with mTORC1 / 2 ( Figure 3C ) or mTORC1 ( RAD001 ; Figure 3B ) inhibition than observed with control cells . Recruitment of ribosomes to Rho family mRNAs during cell spreading To induce assembly of new lamellipodia - like structures in bulk culture , we enzymatically detached cells from their substrate , kept them in suspension until their cytoskeletons disassembled [ 28 ] and then allowed them to spread on a collagen - coated substrate for 30 min [ 28 ] . To monitor global rates of protein synthesis , cells were pulse - labelled with [ 35 S ] methionine for 30 min while in suspension , conﬂuent on collagen I or c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2013 Biochemical Society Localized protein synthesis in MRC5 ﬁbroblasts during cell migration 49 Figure 2 Inhibition of protein synthesis using mTOR inhibitors results in decreased migration velocity and distance in MRC5 ﬁbroblasts Cells were seeded into microﬂuidic chemotaxis chambers , serum - starved for 2h and then exposed to a growth factor gradient , in the absence or presence of 10 μ M mTOR inhibitors , RAD001 or Ku - 0063794 .

As reported previously , confocal microscopy conﬁrmed that ribosomes active in translation were found in lamellopodia [ 28 ] ( Supplementary Figure S2 at http : / / www . biochemj . org / bj / 452 / bj4520045add . htm ) . Extracts were prepared after 30 min of cell spreading and polysomes were isolated by sucrose density - gradient centrifugation as described in the Materials and methods section . Polysome - enriched fractions were collected and the mRNA was puriﬁed and used for ﬁrst - strand synthesis , as described in the Material and methods section . Using QPCR , the resulting cDNA libraries were compared with those collected from conﬂuent cells , which lack extensive lamellipodia ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . As summarized in Table 1 , there was a modest 2 - fold induction in the recruitment of Cdc42 ( cell division cycle 42 ) mRNA to ribosomes during lamellipodia formation , with a smaller change in the total levels of mRNA ( Supplementary Table S1 at http : / / www . biochemj . org / bj / 452 / bj4520045add . htm ) . This marginally exceeds the 1 . 3 - fold increase in total cellular Cdc42 mRNA . A similar result was observed with the preferential recruitment of Rac1 mRNA ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ) . Such a small increase in both total and polysome - associated mRNAs suggests that the latter probably reﬂects changes in the cellular level of the mRNA as a result of increased transcription and / or nuclear export during lamellipodia formation . However , with RhoA , there was a 5 . 5 - fold increase in RhoA mRNA recruited to polysomes ( Table 1 ) , with smaller changes in levels of total mRNA ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . respectively , andcalculatingthedifferenceinareacoverage .

PIP5K1a ( PtdIns4 P 5 - kinase type - 1 α ) catalyses the phosphorylation of PtdIns4 P to form the second messenger , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the precursor to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for the formation of membrane rufﬂes , actin re - organization and focal adhesion formation during directional cell migration in response to integrin activation [ 38 ] . IRSp53 ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ) is implicated in the recruitment and clustering of WAVE complexes to the plasma membrane and therefore the formation of lamellipodia [ 39 , 40 ] . Moreover , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and IRSp53 combine to synergize with Rac1 to activate the WAVE complex at the plasma membrane [ 40 ] . Our QPCR analysis ( Table 1 ) showed a 6 . 4 - fold increase in the recruitment of PIP5K1a mRNA to ribosomes . In addition , there was a 2 . 6 - fold increase in the recruitment of IRSp53 mRNA to polysomes . Brk1 has been reported to exist in a free cytoplasmic pool in the form of a homotrimeric precursor . Following the induction of WAVE complex formation , these trimers dissociate and single Brk1 subunits associate with newly synthesized WAVE subunits to facilitate the assembly of a functional WAVE com - plex [ 41 , 42 ] . Interestingly , QPCR analysis of polysome - derived mRNA from spreading cells showed a large ( 58 . 7 - fold ) stimulation of Brk1 mRNA recruitment of ribosomes following induction of lamellipodium assembly ( Table 1 ) . The large apparent induction of Brk1 mRNA translation could be hypothesized as a mechanism to support the maintenance of a large local critical concentration of Brk1 trimers to facilitate the assembly of active WAVE complexes . The WCA domain of activated WAVE complex presents ATP - loaded G - actin ( globular actin ) monomers to the Arp2 / 3 complex , thus facilitating polymerization of the actin ﬁlament [ 43 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex initiates the formation of actin daughter ﬁlaments [ 44 , 45 ] ; the ArpC2 subunit as part of the structural core of the complex is thought to make substantial contact with the mother ﬁlament . The WAVE complex also contains Abl interactor Abi1 , Nck - associated protein Nap1 , and speciﬁcally Rac1 - associated protein Sra - 1 , where Abi1 plays a central role in holding the complex together , and Sra provides a binding site for active Rac . In addition , interaction of the Abi1 protein with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ) represents the link between growth receptor signalling and actin cytoskeleton remodelling [ 46 ] . This highly regulated WAVE complex is maintained in its inactive state in the cytosol due to Nap1 , which blocks access to the WCA domain , thus inhibiting Arp2 / 3 activity [ 40 ] . This inhibition is released by an allosteric mechanism following the interaction of the WAVE complex with activated Rac1 [ 47 ] . Sra - 1 ( also known as CYFIP ) , functions to protect the WAVE protein from degradation [ 48 ] . As the proteins are central to regulating the WAVE complex , we have also investigated a role for their selective localized protein synthesis during cell spreading . Table 1 shows that in spreading cells , Nap1 mRNA shows a 31 - fold increase in association with polysomes , WAVE mRNA shows a 12 . 4 - fold increase , Sra - 1 shows a 13 - fold increase and Abi1 shows a 2 . 6 - fold increase . Similarly , we see a 31 - fold increase in association of ArpC2 mRNA with ribosomes during lamellipodia assembly . Further studies showed that during cell spreading , β - actin mRNA ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ) , actinin and ﬁlamin mRNAs , and a large number of other mRNAs encoding proteins related to cytoskeletal re - organization were also recruited on to polysomes during cell spreading . These data are consistent with the localized translation of WAVE and regulatory proteins during lamellipodium assembly following the induction of cell spreading . Rac1 , ArpC2 and β - actin mRNAs co - localize with actively translating ribosomes on lamellipodia To analyse selective localized translation directly , we have used a combination of mRNA FISH , puromycilation and IF [ 27 ] . We chose to investigate Rac1 as the primary signalling molecule that stimulates the formation of branched actin , the ArpC2 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex and β - actin . Using a combination of puromycilation [ 27 ] and IF microscopy using antisera raised against the 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 , rpS6 , we have shown that the lamellipodia of migrating ﬁbroblasts are enriched for foci active in protein synthesis ( Figure 4A ) . Furthermore , using FISH , we have shown that ArpC2 mRNA co - localizes with both 40S ribosomes ( Figure 4B ) and translationally active foci ( Figure 4C ) . Statistical analysis of these data using Pearson co - localization coefﬁcients ( R obs ) indicate these events to be highly signiﬁcant ( n = 200 ) . Moreover , when we used FISH in combination with IF microscopy , we found that ArpC2 protein also co - localized with ArpC2 mRNA in lamellipodia with a signiﬁcant Pearson’s co - localization coefﬁcient ( Figure 4D ) . In addition to WAVE1 mRNA ( Figure 4G ) , these translationally active foci are also enriched with Rac1 and β - actin mRNA ( Figures 4E and 4F respectively ) . Steady - state levels of ArpC2 and Rac1 protein increase during lamellipodium formation To investigate the role of localized synthesis of ArpC2 in lamellipodium formation , we used RNAi ( RNA interference ) to deplete the level of cellular ArpC2 protein ( Figure 5A ) . ArpC2 siRNA ( small interfering DNA ) - treated cells exhibited an increased incidence in membrane blebbing compared with the untreated control , consistent with a decrease in the formation of lamellipodium structures ( Figure 5D compared with Figure 5B ) . More extensive membrane blebbing was observed following incubation of MRC5 cells with emetine ( Figure 5C compared with Figure 5B ) . Preventing the recruitment of translation factors to the lamellipodia using short - term treatment with BFA [ 27 , 28 ] revealed a highly blebbed membrane morphology alongside a complete abrogation of lamellipodium formation ( Figure 5E ) , similar to that observed with RNAi depletion of ArpC2 . These data might suggest that the localized de novo synthesis of Arp2 / 3 complex plays a role in regulating lamellipodial structures observed on the leading edge of migrating cells . We have used SDS / PAGE ( 15 % gel ) and Western blotting to investigate whether the steady - state levels of ArpC2 and Rac1 protein increase during cell spreading . Attempts to monitor the synthesis of these proteins by pulse - labelling with radioactive methionine and immunoprecipitation did not yield conclusive data owing to limitations with the commercial antisera ( results not shown ) . Cells were detached from their substrate and kept in suspension for 45 min to allow disassembly of their cytoskeleton . The cells were allowed to spread on a collagen I or ﬁbronectin - coated substrate for 1 h , allowing the formation of extensive lamellipodia [ 28 ] . As shown in Figure 6 ( A ) ( and quantiﬁed in Figure 6B ) , cell spreading led to a 1 . 8 - fold increase in total c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2013 Biochemical Society 52 M . Willett and others Figure 4 Rac1 , ArpC2 and β - actin mRNAs co - localize with actively translating ribosomes on lamellipodia ( A ) Using IF microscopy , puromycin was used to label dimerized ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis [ 21 ] , while antiserum raised against rpS6 was used as a marker for 40S ribosome subunits . The merged image is shown on the lower left - hand panel . ArpC2 mRNA was visualized using FISH as described , and then cells were co - stained with antiserum raised against rpS6 ( B ) , puromycin ( C ) or ArpC2 protein ( D ) .

Rac1 mRNA ( E ) , β - actin mRNA ( F ) and WAVE1 mRNA ( G ) were visualized using FISH , and then , where shown , cells co - stained with antiserum raised against rpS6 . In each case , the merged image is shown on the left - hand panel and the image obtained with a scrambled control Rac1 mRNA probe is shown in ( E ) . These are representative images from a sample of 200 cells for each variable described . Rac1 and , to a lesser extent , ArpC2 protein when there was an increase in recruitment of ArpC2 mRNA to polysomes ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , there was a 3 - fold increase in total levels of Rac1 protein with cells spread on collagen I . The relatively lower fold - change in the steady - state levels of ArpC2 protein compared with the recruitment of ArpC2 mRNA to ribosomes ( 31 - fold ) may reﬂect a large background amount of pre - existing ArpC2 protein compared with the steady - state ribosome loading of ArpC2 mRNA . DISCUSSION Cell migration comprises a cycle in which cells are stimulated to polarize by the actions of Rho GTPases [ 3 ] and extend protrusions formed of large broad lamellipodia , driven and formed of ﬁlamentous actin networks [ 3 , 4 , 43 – 45 , 47 ] . Formation of lamellipodia are dependent on a variety of protein cofactors that mediate their local regulation , structural characteristics and dynamics [ 7 , 43 – 45 , 47 ] . The WAVE – Arp2 / 3 - mediated assembly c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2013 Biochemical Society Localized protein synthesis in MRC5 ﬁbroblasts during cell migration 53 Figure 5 Depletion of ArpC2 results in reduced levels of lamellopodia and an increase in membrane blebbing ( A ) MRC5 cells were incubated with a scrambled siRNA ( − ) or an siRNA speciﬁc to ArpC2 ( + ) , as described in the Materials and methods section .

The role for localized protein synthesis in regulating lamellopodia formation and cell migration has not been resolved . The most characterized example of regulated localized mRNA translation is provided by β - actin mRNA . Localization of actin mRNA is mediated by ZBP1 which binds to a Zipcode comprising bipartite RNA elements in the 3 (cid:2) UTR of β - actin mRNA and is removed following localized src signalling to allow translation at focal adhesions [ 15 – 17 ] . Recent work has shown that binding of ZBP1 to the mRNAs encoding E - cadherin , β - actin , α - actinin and the Arp2 / 3 complex facilitates localization of the mRNAs , which stabilizes cell – cell connections and focal adhesions [ 50 ] . In agreement with such a model , we have demonstrated previously an ECM - sensitive recruitment of ribosomes to focal adhesions during cell spreading [ 28 ] , suggesting that the localized synthesis of focal adhesion components during cell spreading . In addition to src , mTOR signalling , which impinges on the regulation of initiation factor activity [ 19 – 23 ] and localization [ 25 , 26 ] , has also been shown to modulate actin dynamics . The latter occurs via p70 RSK ( p70 ribosomal S6 kinase ) , an effector kinase downstream of mTORC1 , possibly mediated through activation of Rac1 . Moreover , local mTOR activation has been shown to modulate spreading [ 25 , 26 ] and lamellipodium formation in platelets through activation of Rac1 [ 51 ] . Our data , which shows that inhibition of mTOR signalling and protein synthesis affects cell migration velocity and distance ( Figure 2 ) , as well as impairing wound - healing and lamellipodium morphology ( Figure 3 ) , are consistent with a pivotal role for mTOR signalling in regulating actin dynamics . In addition to localized signalling , the recruitment of mRNA into speciﬁc subcellular compartments is required for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity [ 14 ] . Localization ofactinmRNAusingZBP1 inneuronalcellshasbeenshowntoaf - fect the density of dendritic ﬁlopodia and ﬁlopodia synapses [ 15 – 17 ] . In the present study with MRC5 cells , we show that β - actin mRNA is similarly localized to active foci on the leading edge of the cell and is furthermore recruited to polysomes . This might reﬂect a top - up mechanism as there is a large reservoir of available soluble actin monomers within the cytoplasm . In addition , we show that mRNA encoding proteins involved in actin branching and bundling , such as ﬁlamin and α - actinin ( Table 1 ) , are also recruited to polysomes during cell spreading . These data suggest that localized protein synthesis may help modulate actin levels and polymerized structures . Consistent with this is the ﬁnding that all seven constituent mRNAs of the Arp2 / 3 complex are compart - mentalized to protrusions in ﬁbroblasts , although it is unclear as to the nature of the protrusions , or whether they are involved active protein synthesis [ 18 ] . However , our observations show that lamellipodia structures rapidly collapse following inhibition of protein synthesis ( Figure 5 ) . Our data have shown that mRNA encoding WAVE – Arp2 / 3 - associated proteins is co - localized with foci enriched with active protein synthesis at the leading edge during cell migration ( Figure 4 ) . In addition , we show that the steady - state levels of ArpC2 and Rac1 protein increase during lamellipodium formation in MRC5 cells ( Figure 6 ) . This could provide an additional layer of regulation on the assembly of these structures where local de novo synthesis in response to key signalling events could act as a trigger for WAVE activation and complex clustering . Bio - informatic analysis of ArpC2 mRNA alone reveals a potentially complex regulatory structure . The 5 (cid:2) UTR contains a number of interesting motifs which may impinge on translation : a putative G - quadruplex structure ; an FMRP ( fragile X mental retardation protein ) - binding motif implicated in the negative regulation of translation [ 52 ] ; four large stem - loop structures reminiscent of a cellular IRES ( internal ribosome entry site ) [ 53 ] ; a putative GAIT ( interferon - γ - activated inhibitor of translation ) domain involved in reversible selective translation control [ 54 ] ; a putative SECIS ( selenocysteine insertion sequence ) domain involved in the recoding of the translational stop codon in response to selenium availability [ 55 , 56 ] ; and a short ( 270 nt ) upstream open reading frame which is located immediately on the 3 (cid:2) end of the fourth putative stem - loop / SECIS domain . Further work is required to determine which , if any , of these motifs contribute to the localized translation of ArpC2 mRNA . mTOR signalling is also likely to play a key role in modulating actin dynamics , cell spreading and lamellipodium formation in MRC5 cells ( Figure 2 ) . In platelets , this is mediated by p70 RSK , an effector kinase downstream of mTORC1 , possible through the activation of Rac1 [ 51 ] . Interestingly , Sra - 1 , which is a subunit of the WAVE and protects WAVE protein from degradation [ 48 ] , has been shown to be a 4E - BP in the brain where it represses the translation of FMRP mRNA until it reaches the synapse [ 57 ] . This discovery of Sra - 1 as an mRNP ( messenger ribonucleoprotein particle ) - binding partner presents an attractive hypothesis where it might also be involved in the recruitment and translational repression of WAVE complex or related mRNA to lamellipodia . Cell spreading is also associated with an increase in the association of PIP5K1a mRNA with ribosomes ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that localized protein synthesis could modulate PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels , facilitating mTOR activation and WAVE c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2013 Biochemical Society 54 M . Willett and others Figure 6 Steady - state levels of ArpC2 and Rac1 proteins increase during cell spreading ( A ) Cells detached from their growth substrate were held in suspension for 45min and then cells were allowed to spread on a collagen I ( CL ) or ﬁbronectin ( FN ) - coated substrate for 1h .

D . for three experiments . complex clustering . Brk1 , a modulator of the WAVE complex [ 41 , 42 ] , has also been investigated in the present study . Our data show that there is 58 - fold stimulation in Brk1 mRNA recruitment of ribosomes on induction of lamellipodium assembly , possibly to support the maintenance of Brk1 to facilitate the assembly of active WAVE complexes . In spreading cells , we also see a 31 - fold increase and a 12 . 4 - fold increase in the association of NAP - 1 mRNA and WAVE1 mRNA with ribosomes respectively . Similarly , we see a 31 . 3 - fold increase in association of ArpC2 mRNA with ribosomes during lamellipodia assembly ( Table 1 ) , with little change in total mRNA levels ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Furthermore , studies have shown that depletion of Scar / WAVE3 in MDA - MB - 231 cells results in larger and less dynamic lamellipodia , with cells moving less rapidly and typically only showing one lamellipod [ 48 ] . These data are consistent with localized translation of WAVE protein and regulatory proteins during lamellipodium assembly following the induction of cell spreading . One possible scenario that still needs to be addressed is that membrane protrusions are maintained by de novo protein synthesis , and that WAVE – Arp2 / 3 is stabilized by the arrival of Sra - 1 - associated mRNAs .

Figure S1 Global protein synthesis rates do not increase during spreading - induced cytoskeleton remodelling Cells were detached from their growth substrate and held in suspension for 45min , allowed to spread for30minon a growthsurface coatedwith collagen I , orallowed to reachconﬂuenceon collagen I . At 30min before harvest , cells were incubated with 10 μ Ci / ml [ 35 S ] methionine and the incorporation of methionine into protein was monitored by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of protein [ 1 – 3 ] and expressed as c . p . m . / μ g of protein . Figure S2 Localization of active sites of protein synthesis on newly formed lamellipodia during spreading - induced cytoskeleton remodelling Cells were detached from their growth substrate and held in suspension for 45min before being allowed to spread for 30min on a growth surface coated with collagen I until they had produced extensive peripheral lamellipodia . Using IF microscopy , puromycin was used to label dimerized ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis , while antiserum raised against rpS6 was used as a marker for 40S ribosome subunits .
