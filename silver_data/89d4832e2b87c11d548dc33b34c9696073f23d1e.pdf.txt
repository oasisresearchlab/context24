Carter 2 , 6 * Conﬂict monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) has been posited to signal a need for greater cognitive control , producing neural and behavioral adjustments . However , the very occurrence of behavioral adjustments after con - ﬂict has been questioned , along with suggestions that there is no direct evidence of ACC conﬂict - related activity predicting subsequent neural or behavioral adjust - ments in control . Using the Stroop color - naming task and controlling for repetition effects , we demonstrate that ACC conﬂict - related activity predicts both greater prefrontal cortex activity and adjustments in behavior , supporting a role of ACC conﬂict monitoring in the engagement of cognitive control . A major goal of cognitive neuroscience is to understand the precise neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive control ( 1 ) . An impor - tant question about the nature of cognitive control is how do the processes involved in implementing control become engaged , or in other words , what controls control ( 2 ) ? One partial answer comes from the conflict hy - pothesis , which posits that monitoring of re - sponse conflict acts as a signal that engages control processes that are needed to over - come conflict and to perform effectively ( 3 , 4 ) . Two brain regions that have been associ - ated with cognitive control processes are the ACC and the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . Al - though it is commonly accepted that the PFC is involved in implementing control ( 5 – 7 ) , there have been differing hypotheses regard - ing the contribution made by the ACC ( 8 – 10 ) . One of these , the conflict hypothesis , contends that a function of ACC is the mon - itoring of processing conflict ( 3 , 11 ) . How - ever , this has recently been challenged on two grounds : first , failure to find behavioral evi - dence for trial - to - trial adjustments in control following conflict when stimulus repetitions 1 Department of Psychological Sciences , University of Missouri - Columbia , Columbia , MO 65211 , USA . 2 De - partment of Psychiatry , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , PA 15213 , USA . 3 Department of Psychol - ogy , Princeton University , Princeton , NJ 08544 , USA . 4 Department of Psychology , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN 55455 , USA . 5 Department of Radi - ology , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , Pitts - burgh , PA 15213 , USA . 6 Departments of Psychiatry and Psychology , University of California at Davis , Sacramento , CA 95817 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

One prediction of the conflict hypothesis is that the occurrence of conflict and the subsequent engagement of control should re - sult in behavioral adjustments ( 3 ) . For in - stance , in the Stroop color - naming task , there is greater conflict for incongruent trials ( e . g . , naming the color of a word printed in green ink when the word is “RED” ) than for con - gruent trials ( the word “RED” printed in red ink ) ( 13 , 14 ) . Behavioral adjustments following conflict include being faster on incongruent trials pre - ceded by incongruent ( iI ) trials than on in - congruent trials preceded by congruent ( cI ) trials , and being slower on iC than on cC trials . The conflict hypothesis explains these behavioral adjustments as the result of high conflict on incongruent trials leading to the recruitment of greater cognitive control on the subsequent trial ( 3 ) . Thus , iI trials are faster than cI trials because the preceding incongruent trial results in greater cognitive control on an iI than on a cI trial ( conversely , iC are slower than cC trials because the great - er recruitment of cognitive control on iC trials leads to greater focus on the print color , and therefore a reduction of the influence of the word which , in this case , would have been facilitative ) ( 3 , 15 ) . These combined effects should produce a previous trial ( c versus i ) by current trial ( C versus I ) interaction . Such effects have been observed in previous studies ( 15 , 16 ) using the Eriksen flanker task ( 17 ) , a spatial analog to the Stroop task . How - ever , the interpretation of these effects in terms of adjustments in control has recently been challenged . Mayr and colleagues ( 12 ) reported results suggesting that previous evidence of post - conflict adjustments using the Eriksen flanker task may instead have been due to the effects of stimulus repetitions , so they called into question the interpretation of these findings as support for the conflict hypothesis . Another important prediction of the con - flict hypothesis is that conflict - related activ - ity in ACC should predict a subsequent in - crease in PFC activity . This is based on the assumption that PFC is responsible for exe - cuting cognitive control and producing cor - responding adjustments in behavior . Previous research has yet to provide direct evidence for such effects . To test these predictions we used the Stroop task , which produces greater reaction time ( RT ) interference and has fewer stimu - lus repetitions than the Eriksen flanker task used in previous work . First , we examined whether adjustments in behavior were present after removing stimulus repetitions . Then , we examined whether ACC conflict - related ac - tivity was associated with greater behavioral adjustments and increased PFC activity on the subsequent trial , as predicted by the con - flict hypothesis . Finally , we examined a closely related set of predictions of the con - flict hypothesis , that ACC error - related activ - ity should also be followed by an increase in PFC activity and corresponding adjustments in performance ( 18 , 19 ) . According to the conflict hypothesis , adjustments occur after errors , because error trials involve a high degree of response conflict . Therefore , we examined not only whether ACC conflict - related activity predicted behavioral adjust - ments , but also whether ACC error - related activity predicted an increase in PFC activity and behavioral adjustments ( 20 ) . Participants performed the Stroop color - naming task ( n (cid:6) 23 ) . We analyzed only trials that did not include a repetition of either the color or the word , subjecting these to a two by two analysis of variance [ ( previous trial : congruent versus incongruent ) versus ( current trial : congruent versus incongruent ) ] . There was a significant interaction of previ - ous by current trial type [ F ( 1 , 22 ) (cid:6) 5 . 02 , P (cid:5) 0 . 05 , effect size , r (cid:6) 0 . 43 ] ( 21 ) , reflect - ing a post - conflict adjustment effect ( Fig . 1A ) . Post hoc contrasts revealed that cI trials were significantly slower than iI trials ( mean RT difference (cid:6) 56 ms , P (cid:5) 0 . 01 ) . In con - trast , iC and cC trials did not significantly differ ( mean RT difference (cid:6) 1 . 4 ms ; P (cid:7) 0 . 85 ) , presumably because of small or absent facilitation effects , as is common in the Stroop task ( 14 ) . Virtually identical results were obtained when we removed only trials that included exact stimulus repetitions ( that is , both color and word repeated ; in addition , the amount of post - error behavioral adjust - ment was significant ; for these results , see supporting online material ) . Separate analyses of conflict - and error - related activity identified activity of over - lapping regions within the ACC ( Fig . 2A ) . Using the conflict ACC area as a region of interest ( ROI ) , we found significant error - related activity in that area . Similarly , we found significant conflict - related activity in the error ACC region . This replicated find - ings from a previous study comparing con - flict - and error - related activity within the ACC ( 11 ) . In our subsequent analyses , we used these regions as ROIs to examine whether ACC activity was associated with behavior and PFC activity in ways predict - ed by the conflict hypothesis . First , we tested the prediction that ACC activity on incongruent trials should be less for iI than cI trials . This is because , for iI trials , conflict on the previous trial should recruit additional control and thus reduce conflict on the current trial . As predicted , we found significantly less ACC activity for iI trials than for cI trials ( Fig . 1B ) . This corrob - orates previous findings using the Eriksen flanker task , which suggested that behavioral adjustments in response to conflict on a prior trial reduce conflict and associated ACC ac - tivity on the current trial ( 15 ) . Next , we tested whether ACC activity predicted behavioral adjustments on the sub - sequent trial . To do so , we divided trials into high - adjustment and low - adjustment trials ( 22 ) . As predicted by the conflict hypothesis , high - adjustment trials were associated with greater ACC activity on the previous trial than low - adjustment trials ( Fig . 2B ) . In other words , greater ACC activity was followed by faster responding on iI trials ( 23 ) . Further - more , greater ACC activity on error trials was associated with greater post - error adjustment on the subsequent trial ( 24 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . Thus , as predicted by the conflict hypothesis , great - er ACC activity on high - conflict correct trials and error trials was associated with adjust - ments in behavior on the subsequent trial that reflect augmented control . Finally , we tested two critical predictions regarding the involvement of the PFC in con - trol and its interaction with the ACC . First , we examined whether PFC activity was asso - ciated with behavioral adjustments , as would be predicted if these were mediated by PFC execution of control . As predicted , trials ex - hibiting the greatest adjustments in behavior following conflict were associated with in - creased activity in the dorsolateral PFC [ right Fig . 1 . ( A ) Post - conﬂict behavioral adjustments without stimulus repetitions . C , congruent ; I , incongruent . ( B ) ACC activity associated with adjustments in behavior . Percent signal change is the difference from correct congruent trials . Each scan ( s ) was 1 . 5 s in duration , with the current incongruent stimulus presented at the beginning of s1 . Note that the peak of the BOLD response occurs during s4 , which , as ex - pected , is between 4 . 5 and 6 . 0 s after the onset of the incongruent stimulus .

There was a second PFC region , in the right superior frontal gyrus ( BAs 9 and 10 ) , that was also more active on trials with the greatest post - conflict behavior - al adjustments . A similar analysis for post - error adjustments of behavior did not reveal any areas of significant activity . However , using the right dorsolateral PFC area associ - ated with post - conflict adjustments as an ROI , we found that an increase of activity in this area was significantly associated with slower responding on post - error trials . Thus , a region that is associated with post - conflict adjustments in behavior also ap - pears to be associated with post - error ad - justments in behavior . Second , we tested whether ACC activity on conflict and error trials predicted activity in our PFC ROI on the following trial . This correla - tion was significant ( P (cid:5) 0 . 01 ) , even after partialling out shared variance with another task - responsive brain region outside of the fron - tal lobes ( in the left temporal lobe ) ( 25 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . These findings suggest a direct and spe - cific relation between ACC and PFC that is not explained by widespread fluctuations in brain activity unrelated to the task or a generalized effect of task engagement , although it remains possible that the correlation between these areas reflects the common influence of some other as yet unidentified area ( s ) . In summary , we found evidence for a direct relation between ACC activity on high - conflict and error trials and behavioral adjust - ments , reflecting a recruitment of control on subsequent trials . These behavioral adjust - ments were associated with increases in PFC activity , which was itself directly related to ACC activity on the preceding trial . These findings are all consistent with predictions made by the hypothesis that ACC implements a conflict - monitoring function and that en - gagement of this function leads to the recruit - ment of cognitive control . Additionally , these findings provide further support for the hy - pothesis that PFC is responsible for the exe - cution of cognitive control . They are also consistent with the hypothesis that the ACC itself is not responsible for the allocation of control . Although they cannot rule out a role for the ACC in the execution of control , previous studies have provided evidence against this view ( 15 , 26 ) . Within the PFC , primarily right - sided re - gions were associated with behavioral adjust - ments in behavior . Two other studies have reported similar findings within the PFC , but with primarily left - sided activations associat - ed with the allocation of control . Garavan and colleagues reported greater left inferior PFC activity after errors were made ( 1 ) , and Mac - Donald et al . reported left middle frontal gyrus activity during preparation to overcome conflict ( 27 ) . The different PFC regions ac - tivated by these studies could reflect differ - ences in the control processes engaged by the different task configurations used in these studies . Garavan et al . used a Go – No Go task in which participants only responded to a particular alternating sequence of letters ( e . g . , “X - Y - X - Y” ) . MacDonald et al . used a cued , task - switching version of the Stroop task in which a verbal cue indicated whether to name the color or read the word . This cue was followed by a 12 . 5 - s interval , which provided participants with considerable time to prepare for the next trial , including implement ad - justments in control . This differed from the current study , which involved only color naming , and stimuli that appeared every 3 s requiring that trial - to - trial adjustments in control be made much more rapidly . These differences between studies may have en - gaged different PFC control processes . With regard to the region of ACC that we have identified with conflict monitoring ( in this study and others ) , it is important to em - phasize that this area makes up a small por - tion of a large structure . Monitoring response conflict may represent one instance of a more general family of functions subserved by ACC , which is to monitor internal states for signs of breakdowns in processing and per - formance that require adjustments in control ( 28 ) . This is consistent with other observa - tions that have been made about ACC func - tion , including its response to pain ( 29 ) . Finally , it should be noted that neither our study ( nor any others of which we are aware ) have produced insights into the specific mechanisms by which detection of conflict in ACC engages the recruitment of control . One possibility is that ACC issues specific signals that govern the recruitment of control , acti - vating relevant representations in PFC . In contrast , we have favored the view that ACC signals modulate the strength of PFC repre - sentations , whereas other mechanisms deter - mine their content . This modulation could be produced by a direct influence of ACC on PFC , or by way of other neuromodulatory systems , such as the locus coeruleus ( 2 ) . References and Notes 1 . H . Garavan , T . J .

High - adjustment trials were deﬁned as all iI trials with an RT faster than their median . Conversely , low - adjustment trials were slow iI trials . 23 . Although there was not a signiﬁcant adjustment effect for iC trials , we performed a similar analysis , with high - adjustment iC trials being the third slowest iC trials and low - adjustment trials being the third fastest iC trials . Again , increased ACC conﬂict activity predicted greater adjustment , with increased ACC activity preceding slow iC trials . ( We used a median split for iI trials because of their fewer number . ) The pattern of results for iI and iC trials indicates that ACC activity on the previous trial was not associated with overall faster or slower responses on the current trial , but rather that there was an interaction be - tween speed and current trial type [ F ( 1 , 22 ) (cid:6) 9 . 67 , P (cid:5) 0 . 005 ] . 24 . This analysis was performed only on post - error con - gruent trials , as there were too few post - error incon - gruent trials ( 30 % of all trials were incongruent—see Supporting Online Material ) to support a reliable analysis . For this reason , post - error adjustments were expected to produce a slowing of response . 25 . To conduct this analysis , we examined associations of ACC and PFC with a third region , in the left temporal lobe , that showed the largest response to incongru - ent trials of any nonfrontal regions , and then con - trolled for these relations in assessing the correlation between ACC and PFC . Speciﬁcally , for each partici - pant , we partialed out the variance in the relation between ACC ( on conﬂict and error trials ) and the temporal region ( on post - conﬂict and post - error tri - als ) , and similarly for PFC ( on post - conﬂict and post - error trials ) and the temporal region ( on conﬂict and error trials ) . We then performed a t test to deter - mine whether the residual correlation between ACC and PFC activity across the group of participants was signiﬁcant ( see Supporting Online Material ) . 26 . C .

We report that the inhibition of Cdh1 - APC in primary neurons speciﬁcally enhanced axonal growth . Cdh1 knockdown in cerebellar slice overlay assays and in the developing rat cerebellum in vivo revealed cell - autonomous abnormalities in layer - speciﬁc growth of granule neuron axons and parallel ﬁber patterning . Cdh1 RNA interference in neurons was also found to override the inhibitory inﬂuence of myelin on axonal growth . Thus , Cdh1 - APC appears to play a role in regulating axonal growth and patterning in the developing brain that may also limit the growth of injured axons in the adult brain . The ubiquitin ligase anaphase - promoting complex ( APC ) is essential for coordination of cell cycle transitions , including mitotic exit ( 1 – 3 ) . APC activity is stimulated by the regulatory proteins Cdc20 and Cdh1 in a cell cycle – dependent manner . Cdc20 association with APC is required for APC activity dur - ing early mitosis , but Cdh1 association is required for APC activity during late mito - sis and G1 ( 4 , 5 ) . Cdh1 and core compo - nents of APC are also expressed in post - mitotic neurons in the mammalian brain ( 6 , 7 ) . To characterize Cdh1 function in postmi - totic neurons , we used a DNA template – based RNA interference ( RNAi ) method to acutely knock down the expression of Cdh1 in primary cerebellar granule neurons ( 8 ) . The expression of cdh1 small hairpin RNAs ( shcdh1 ) reduced Cdh1 expression in COS cells and in primary neurons ( fig . S1 , A and B ) . The shcdh1 - ex - pressing granule neurons did not reenter the cell cycle , failing to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine or undergo cytokinesis ( 9 ) . Cdh1 knockdown had no effect on the survival of the granule neurons ( fig . S1C ) . However , Cdh1 knock - down altered the morphology of neuronal processes , raising the possibility that Cdh1 might regulate neuronal morphogenesis . To determine the role of Cdh1 in neuronal morphogenesis , we transfected primary cere - bellar granule neurons from postnatal day 6 ( P6 ) rat pups with the control U6 or U6 / shcdh1 plasmid at the time of plating , when these neu - rons just begin to grow axons ( 8 ) . Each day for 6 days after transfection , we measured the length of axons and dendrites in the same trans - fected granule neurons . Axons and dendrites of transfected neurons were identified on the basis of their morphology and by the expression of the axonal marker Tau and the somato - dendritic marker MAP2 ( Fig . 1A ) . While the expression of shcdh1 in granule neurons had little effect on the generation and growth of dendrites , Cdh1 knockdown led to a dramatic increase in axonal length ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) , both accelerating the rate of growth and significantly augmenting the final axonal length ( Fig . 1C ) . The vast majority of transfected cells expressed the neuron - specific (cid:1) - tubulin type III ( Tuj1 ) , a marker of postmitotic granule neurons that was not affect - ed by Cdh1 RNAi ( Fig . 1E ) . Thus , Cdh1 spe - cifically inhibits axonal but not dendritic growth in postmitotic granule neurons . Cdh1 RNAi lowered the numbers of neu - rons with short axons and increased the num - bers of neurons with long axons , which sup - ports the idea that Cdh1 knockdown did not operate in a subpopulation of neurons ( Fig . 1D ) . In other experiments , Cdh1 knockdown in - creased the total length but not the number of branches of granule neuron axons ( 9 ) , which suggests that Cdh1 knockdown specifically en - hances the growth of the major axonal fibers in neurons . A second construct encoding small hairpin cdh1 RNAs ( shcdh1 - b ) that reduced the expression of Cdh1 also promoted the growth of axons ( Fig . 1F ) . shRNAs to several other genes encoding proteins unrelated to Cdh1 , in - cluding the transcription factor MEF2A ( 10 ) , failed to promote axonal growth ( Fig . 1F ) . 1 Department of Pathology , 2 Department of Genetics , Harvard Medical School , 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 3 Department of Biochemis - try and Molecular Biology , University of Calgary , 3330 Hospital Drive Northwest , Calgary , Alberta T2N 4N1 , Canada . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
