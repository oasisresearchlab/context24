The concepts of turgor , cell wall elasticity , osmotically active volume , and intracellular osmolarity have been investigated for decades , but a consistent rigorous parameterization of these concepts is lacking . Here , we subjected several data sets of minimum volume measurements in yeast obtained after hyper - osmotic shock to a thermodynamic modeling framework . We estimated parameters for several relevant biophysical cell properties and tested alternative hypotheses about these concepts using a model discrimination approach . In accordance with previous reports , we estimated an aver - age initial turgor of 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 MPa and found that turgor becomes negligible at a relative volume of 93 . 3 ± 6 . 3 % corresponding to an osmotic shock of 0 . 4 ± 0 . 2 Osm / l . At high stress levels ( 4 Osm / l ) , plasmolysis may occur . We found that the volumetric elastic modulus , a measure of cell wall elasticity , is 14 . 3 ± 10 . 4 MPa . Our model discrimina - tion analysis suggests that other thermodynamic quantities affecting the intracellular water potential , for example the matrix potential , can be neglected under physiological con - ditions . The parameterized turgor models showed that acti - vation of the osmosensing high osmolarity glycerol ( HOG ) signaling pathway correlates with turgor loss in a 1 : 1 rela - tionship . This ﬁnding suggests that mechanical properties of the membrane trigger HOG pathway activation , which can be represented and quantitatively modeled by turgor . M . A ` . Adrover , E . Eriksson , S .

This gradient is counterbalanced by a hydrostatic pressure , called turgor , which is especially prominent in plants and unicellular organisms , most notably fungi . The concept of turgor has been debated for many years ( Burstro¨m 1971 ) . It is recognized that turgor plays a vital role in growth ( Cosgrove 1981 ; Zimmermann 1978 ; Marechal and Gervais 1994 ) , cell structure ( Cosgrove 1993 ; Morris et al . 1986 ; Zhongcan and Helfrich 1987 ; Munns et al . 1983 ) , and membrane transport processes ( Zimmermann 1978 ; Lande et al . 1995 ; Kamiya et al . 1963 ; Soveral et al . 2008 ) and that it may be sensed by the cells as an indicator of external osmotic changes ( Tamas et al . 2000 ; Coster et al . 1976 ; Schmalstig and Cosgrove 1988 ; Reiser et al . 2003 ) . Therefore , quantifying cell wall and membrane properties , and thus the resulting turgor pressure , has been the aim of numerous studies ( Cosgrove 1981 ; Morris et al . 1986 ; Munns et al . 1983 ; Kamiya et al . 1963 ; Coster et al . 1976 ; Smith et al . 1998 , 2000a , b , c ; Marechal et al . 1995 ; Gervais et al . 1996a ; Cosgrove 2000 ) . Parameterized models of turgor pressure , based on cell wall and mem - brane properties are especially important for quantitative mathematical models describing the interdependence between water transport and signaling processes ( Schaber and Klipp 2008 ; Klipp et al . 2005 ; Gennemark et al . 2006 ; Kargol and Kargol 2003a , 2003 ) . At present , it is not possible to directly measure turgor in yeast . However , the so - called linear elastic theory states that the change in turgor pressure P is proportional to a relative change in membrane enclosed cell volume V m , i . e . , d P ¼ e d V m V m ; ð 1 Þ where e is a proportionality factor , called volumetric elastic modulus or bulk modulus . This factor can be viewed as a measure of the elasticity of the cell wall . Thus , the turgor pressure can be derived from cell volume measurements that have been performed repeatedly on yeast cells under different experimental conditions ( Munns et al . 1983 ; Smith et al . 2000a , b , c ; Touhami et al . 2003 ; Wei et al . 2001 ; Martinez de Maranon et al . 1996 ; Arnold and Lacy 1977 ) . However , the results obtained for turgor pressure were highly inconsistent , with variations spanning up to three orders of magnitude from 0 . 05 ( Martinez de Maranon et al . 1996 ) to 2 . 9 ( Arnold and Lacy 1977 ) MPa . The concepts of turgor , cell wall elasticity , osmotically active volume and intracellular osmolarity have never been quantiﬁed and parameterized together in a consistent framework , nor challenged by alternative concepts ( Smith et al . 2000c ; Martinez de Maranon et al . 1996 ; Gervais et al . 1996b ) . Moreover , the few reports in which turgor and / or cell wall elasticity were quantitatively determined used non - physiological experimental conditions . For example , one study used pre - stressed cells ( Marechal et al . 1995 ) and in two others , the cells were suspended in dis - tilled water before volume measurements ( Smith et al . 2000b , c ) . The objective of this study was to derive parameterized models of turgor and other biophysical properties of the cell , for example the volumetric elastic modulus , in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We developed a modeling frame - work that includes the concepts of turgor pressure , intra and extracellular osmotic pressure , and membrane and volume properties and , for the ﬁrst time , also other thermodynamic quantities , for example the matrix potential , in a consistent manner . By reformulating sub - modules while keeping the overall framework consistent , we could test several hypotheses describing the relationship between cell volume and changes in the intracellular water potential . Veriﬁcation of these hypotheses was based on four independent data sets . To ensure a wide applicability of the selected model , the conditions for generating each data set were slightly different . We also correlated cell volume measurements with Hog1 phosphorylation levels and Hog1 - GFP nuclear localization to investigate the physiological consequences of turgor loss under hyper - osmotic stress in a quantitative fashion . Hog1 is the yeast p38 stress - activated protein kinase whose phosphorylation level and subcellular locali - zation are controlled by an osmo - sensing signaling pathway ( Hohmann 2002 ) . We found a 1 : 1 relationship between turgor loss and HOG pathway activation . A loss of turgor relates to HOG pathway activation such that when turgor becomes zero because of application of a hyperosmotic solution the HOG pathway is maximally activated . This ﬁnding suggests that the extent of HOG pathway activation is directly linked to some mechanical property of the membrane , which can be represented and quantitatively modeled by the loss of turgor pressure . Materials and methods Descriptions and units of all variables and parameters are listed in Table 1 . 1548 Eur Biophys J ( 2010 ) 39 : 1547 – 1556 123 Modeling framework We assume that the change in osmotically active volume V os is equal to the water ﬂux across the cell membrane , which is driven by differences in chemical water potentials inside and outside the cell . Based on these thermodynamic principles ( for details refer to the ‘‘Supplementary mate - rial’’ ) we developed a model describing the minimal vol - ume of yeast cells attained after osmotic shock , V apmin , which included several new aspects that are depicted in Fig . 1 . We made a distinction between the commonly measured volume that is enclosed by the cell wall , which we refer to as the apparent volume V ap , and the membrane - enclosed cytoplasmic volume , V m , where osmotic and hydrostatic pressures are deﬁned . V m comprises the osmotically active volume V os and the minimal solid cytosolic volume V b , i . e . , V m = V os ? V b . We assume that for osmotic shocks higher than a critical value of c ple or volumes lower than a critical value of V appl , the membrane ( V m ) detaches from the cell wall ( V ap ) , i . e . , plasmolysis occurs , giving rise to the periplasmic volume V pl , such that V ap = V m ? V pl . Fur - thermore , we deﬁne V m P = 0 as the volume at which the turgor becomes zero and V m s as the volume where negative hydrostatic effects and / or matrix potential effects become important , corresponding to hyperosmotic shock levels of c P = 0 e and c s e , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . The latter two are thresholds that affect the rate of water outﬂow , i . e . , shrinkage . Between V m P = 0 and V m s apparent cell volume is a reciprocal function of external osmolarity , also called the van’t Hoff relationship ( Noble 1969 ) ( Eq . S6 in ‘‘Supple - mentary material’’ ) . Based on these concepts , we derived a formula for the apparent minimum volume after osmotic shock V apmin as a function of turgor pressure P V minap , osmo - larities and volumes : V min ap ¼ V b þ V pl þ c i 0 V 0ap (cid:3) V b (cid:3) V pl (cid:2) (cid:3) P V minap a PC RT þ c estress þ c e0 ð 2 Þ where c 0 i is the initial internal osmolarity ( Eq .

In general , there are two alternatives , i . e . , the one - sided model ( Eq . S7 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) and the two - sided model ( Eq .

Turgor pressure and matrix potential Thermodynamic quantities other than turgor and osmolar - ity , that can affect the cellular water potential , are usually ignored . For example , a speciﬁc fraction of the intracellular water might be bound to colloidal surfaces by electrostatic interactions . This water is not freely available in solution , which lowers the total intracellular water potential by a value that is termed the matrix potential ( Grifﬁn 1981 ) . In addition , it is possible that the cytoskeleton mechanically counteracts cell shrinkage such that the cell has an inherent tendency to re - swell in a sponge - like fashion . This effect would also reduce the total intracellular water potential . For simplicity , we summarize these effects under the term matrix potential ( D s in Eq . S1 of the ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) . Quantitative descriptions of the matrix poten - tial are not available and elaborated models of mechanical forces induced by volume changes ( Stamenovic and Coughlin 1999 ) are beyond the scope of this study . Therefore , we include the effects summarized under the term of the matrix potential in the model of the turgor pressure P V minap with a simple mathematical description . In this way , we obtain an expression for P V minap including the matrix potential ( assuming V pl = 0 for V m C V m P = 0 ) : P V minap V minap ; V pl ; V P ¼ 0 m ; V s m ; e ; e s (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ e ln V minap V P ¼ 0 m (cid:2) (cid:3) for V minap (cid:4) V P ¼ 0 m 0 for V s m (cid:5) V minap (cid:3) V pl \ V P ¼ 0 m e s ln V minap (cid:3) V pl V s m (cid:2) (cid:3) for V minap (cid:3) V pl \ V s m 8 > > < > > : ð 3 Þ In Fig . 2 P V minap is displayed as a function of V m = V apmin - V pl . We tested Eq . 3 against the data , with and without the term for matrix potential , which we refer to as the one - sided and the two - sided models , respectively . We also tested three hypotheses regarding the size of the periplas - mic volume V pl , ( a ) V pl = 0 , ( b ) V pl [ 0 with a constant apparent volume V appl ( Fig . 1 ; Eq . S10 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) , and ( c ) V pl [ 0 with a variable apparent volume V appl ( Eq . S11 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) . Inserting Eq . 3 into Eq . 2 yields an implicit expression for V apmin that depends on various parameters of the speciﬁc model for turgor , matrix effect , and periplasmic volume . When a solution exists , this solution is unique ( see ‘‘Sup - plementary material’’ ) . Fig . 1 Qualitative representation of cell volume concepts .

The diagrams of the cells illustrate the cell wall and the membrane in different states after hyper - osmotic shock Fig . 2 Illustration of turgor and matrix potential . Turgor ( black line ) , which has an initial value of P 0 at the initial turgid cell volume of 100 % , is displayed on the positive y - axis . When the cell shrinks , the turgor decreases to zero at the volume V m P = 0 . This is referred to as the ‘‘one - sided turgor model’’ . The matrix potential or other effects that reduce the water potential are displayed on the negative y - axis . These are assumed to become important below a speciﬁc threshold volume V m s . The model represented by the solid line up to V m s together with the dashed line is referred to as the ‘‘two - sided turgor model’’ 1550 Eur Biophys J ( 2010 ) 39 : 1547 – 1556 123 Model discrimination Using Eq . 2 together with a model for V pl ( Eqs . S10 , S11 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) and a turgor model ( Eq . 3 ; Eqs . S7 , S8 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) , a solution for V apmin can be numerically determined . When V apmin is mea - sured , Eq . 2 can be ﬁtted to the data by estimating the respective parameters ( Table S1 in ‘‘Supplementary mate - rial’’ ) , e . g . , by minimizing the sum of squared residuals ( SSR ) SSR ð x Þ ¼ X n i ¼ 1 1 r i V minap ; i ð x Þ (cid:3) V minmeasured ; i (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 ; where x = ( x 1 , x 2 , … , x m ) denote the parameters that are to be estimated and that depend on the model ( Table S1 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) , r i is the standard deviation of the measurements and n is the number of data points . For the sake of simplicity , we assume that the measurement errors are independently normally distributed . Thus , the SSR becomes a maximum - likelihood estimator and we can use the Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample size ( AICc ) to rank and , thus , discriminate the models according to their SSR and number of parameters ( Burnham and Anderson 2002 ) : AICc ¼ 2 k þ n ln 2 p SSR n (cid:4) (cid:5) þ 1 (cid:4) (cid:5) þ 2 k ð k þ 1 Þ n (cid:3) k (cid:3) 1 ; ð 4 Þ where k is the number of parameters . The ﬁtting was performed by differential evolution , a global optimization method ( Storn and Price 1997 ) , and the models were ranked according to the AICc ( Eq . 4 ) . Additionally , for the best model , we performed a Monte – Carlo analysis by re - sampling the data a hundred times assuming a normal distribution with the respective stan - dard deviations for each data point . In this way , means and conﬁdence intervals for the estimated parameters could be obtained . Data sets We collected three independent data sets ( data sets 1 – 3 in Fig . 3 ; Fig . S1 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) and took one data set from the literature ( Marechal et al . 1995 ) ( data set 4 in Fig . 3 ; Fig . S2 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) . The cell volume was quantiﬁed immediately before and after the hyperosmotic stress , ensuring that the minimum volume after osmotic shock was measured . For our experiments we used NaCl as an osmoticum , whereas in the data set from literature yeast cells were subjected to a wide range of glycerol concentrations ( refer to Marechal et al . 1995 for details ) . Table 2 summarizes the different data sets . Experimental details for data sets 1 – 3 are described in the ‘‘Supplementary material’’ . Results Parameter ﬁtting and model selection predicts turgor pressure and other biophysical cell properties We ﬁtted V apmin from Eq . 2 to four different data sets using alternative models for P V minm and V pl , resulting in seven different models ( see Table S1 in ‘‘Supplementary mate - rial’’ for a complete listing ) . For each data set the best model according to the AICc is described in Table 3 . The ﬁtted and measured V apmin are displayed in Fig . 3 , with the corresponding predicted turgor pressure . One - sided turgor model is most appropriate for physiological stress conditions The three data sets produced for this study were all ﬁtted best by the one - sided turgor model based on Eqs . 1 and 3 , where only the positive turgor pressure plays a role ( Fig . 2 ) . Even though this is the generally accepted model ( Cosgrove 1981 ; Marechal and Gervais 1994 ; Klipp et al . 2005 ; Gennemark et al . 2006 ; Meikle et al . 1988 ) , we tested it with six other models , because to our knowledge it has never been challenged by other models , nor rigorously ﬁtted to data . Thus , we show for the ﬁrst time that effects resisting cell shrinkage , for example the matrix potential or mechanical forces , can be neglected under physiological conditions . Consequently , when the turgor becomes zero after an external osmotic shock of c P = 0 e ( Table 1 ; Fig . 3 ) , the measured apparent volume V ap is well predicted by the membrane enclosed volume V m according to the van’t Hoff’s equation ( Eq . S6 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) . This means that the cell wall tightly follows the shrinkage of the membrane enclosed volume . Data set 4 , which was collected by applying extreme stress levels , also favored the one - sided turgor model . However , at 4 Osm / l plas - molysis was predicted , with a constant minimal apparent volume V appl of 65 % . Estimated biophysical cell properties are similar between experiments Parameters estimated on the basis of the datasets give a consistent picture of important biophysical cell properties . For data sets 2 and 3 , where single cell information was available , we distinguished between small and large cells and repeated the analysis to test whether cell size had an effect on the results . We found no signiﬁcant differences between small and large cells with regard to the estimated parameters , which is in agreement with earlier reports ( Martinez de Maranon et al . 1996 ) . The solid volume V b was estimated to be between 33 and 49 % of the initial cell volume , which also corresponds to earlier reports Eur Biophys J ( 2010 ) 39 : 1547 – 1556 1551 123 ( Marechal et al . 1995 ; Meikle et al . 1988 ) . The initial turgor estimated on the basis of the three data sets with similar experimental conditions ( data sets 1 – 3 ) was 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 MPa on average , which conﬁrmed results from earlier studies ( Smith et al . 2000c ; Gervais et al . 1996a ; Meikle et al . 1988 ) . The estimated membrane rigidity e was the parameter that varied the most between experiments and it turned out to be a sensitive , poorly determined parameter , which is reﬂected by the relatively high stan - dard deviations . However , at least for the three directly comparable data sets 1 – 3 , the results were similar , giving an average volumetric elastic modulus of 14 . 3 ± 10 . 4 MPa ranging from 5 . 7 to 25 . 8 MPa . On the basis of our general modeling framework and the estimated parameters , we could derive several other inter - esting cell properties . The initial osmolarity within the cell c 0 i was estimated to be up to more than twice the osmolarity of the outside medium . Thus , apparently , yeast can main - tain substantial osmotic gradients between the inside and outside of the cell , which are equilibrated by turgor . The volume at which turgor becomes zero was estimated to be of 93 . 3 ± 6 . 3 % on average for data sets 1 – 3 . The corre - sponding external shock for the salt experiments was 0 . 4 ± 0 . 2 Osm / l , corresponding to a salt concentration of roughly 0 . 2 M NaCl . As this is within the range of con - centrations in which saturation of HOG pathway activation Fig . 3 Best ﬁt models and data . The data and the best ﬁt model ( solid line ) refer to the left y - axis . The dark gray region depicts the 95 % conﬁdence region of the ﬁtted model . The right y - axis refers to the estimated turgor pressure ( dashed line ) . The light gray region depicts the 95 % conﬁdence region of the estimated turgor pressure . The x - axis refers to concentrations of the respective stress agent . The conﬁdence regions were calculated on the basis of the conﬁdence intervals of the estimated parameters ( Table 3 ) .

Loss of turgor correlates with HOG pathway activation The exact biophysical mechanisms that trigger the activa - tion of the HOG pathway in yeast have not yet been determined ( Hohmann 2002 ) , but there is evidence that the turgor is one of the factors involved ( Tamas et al . 2000 ; Reiser et al . 2003 ) . As our computational analysis provided us with parameterized models of turgor pressure ( Fig . 3 ; Table 3 ) , we tested whether there is a correlation between the loss of turgor for different degrees of osmotic shock and the extent of HOG pathway activation . Thus , in addi - tion to cell volume measurements , we collected two inde - pendent data sets reﬂecting the degree of HOG pathway activation depending on the intensity of the hyperosmotic stress . In the ﬁrst data set , the extent of Hog1 nuclear accumulation was measured , whereas the second data set represents the extent of Hog1 phosphorylation in response to different NaCl concentrations ( Fig . 4 , for details about the measurements refer to the ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) . By considering both Hog1 activation ( Fig . 4 ) and the predicted turgor ( dotted line in Fig . 3 ) as a function of applied osmotic stress , we could investigate Hog1 activa - tion as a function of predicted turgor ( Fig . 5 ) . With three different parameterizations for the turgor model ( from data sets 1 – 3 , data set 4 was disregarded , because it used a different stress agent ) and two different Hog1 activation data sets , we obtained six turgor - Hog1 activation correla - tions , of which we display three in Fig . 5 . The others are displayed in the ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ( Fig . S3 ) . We ﬁtted a linear relationship between HOG pathway activation and relative turgor for the three different parameterized models , corresponding to data sets 1 – 3 , and the two different HOG pathway activation data sets ( black lines in Fig . 5 ) by a weighted orthogonal regression . Our null hypothesis claimed a direct 1 : 1 linear relationship , i . e . , H 0 : a ? bx , with ( a , b ) = ( 100 , - 1 ) ( gray lines in Fig . 5 ) . To test H 0 we computed conﬁdence regions for the estimated parameter pairs ( a , b ) by a Monte – Carlo analysis . As can be seen from the insets in Fig . 5 , in all cases the hypothesized relationship ( gray points ) was within the 95 % conﬁdence region of the actual estimated parameter pair . Thus , the null hypothesis could not be Table 3 Results of parameter ﬁts of Eq . 2 for the best selected model according to the AICc Data set 1 Data set 2 Data set 3 Data set 4 # 2 2 2 4 Selected model P V minm One - sided One - sided One - sided One - sided V pl 0 0 0 Constant V ap pl k 3 3 3 4 V b 49 . 0 ± 3 . 4 40 . 2 ± 5 . 5 33 . 0 ± 4 . 8 40 . 1 ± 11 . 1 Estimated parameters P 0 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 0 . 9 ± 0 . 2 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 3 . 4 ± 1 . 0 e 25 . 8 ± 7 . 0 5 . 7 ± 2 . 0 11 . 4 ± 2 . 1 28 . 6 ± 11 . 3 V ap pl 65 . 0 ± 5 . 9 c 0 i 0 . 4 ± 0 . 1 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 0 . 5 ± 0 . 0 2 . 2 ± 0 . 4 Derived parameters V m P = 0 98 . 2 ± 3 . 1 86 . 1 ± 6 . 3 95 . 5 ± 6 . 8 88 . 9 ± 10 . 8 c P = 0 e 0 . 2 ± 0 . 1 0 . 5 ± 0 . 2 0 . 2 ± 0 . 1 1 . 9 ± 1 . 9 c pl e 4 . 4 ± 2 . 2 For a complete description of parameters and units refer to Table 1 # Number of best selected model ( Table S1 in ‘‘Supplementary material’’ ) , P V minm : selected turgor model ( Fig . 2 ; Eq . 3 ) , V pl : selected V pl model ( Fig . 1 ; Eq .

Moreover , the Kendall - rank correlation coefﬁ - cient ( Kendall and Gibbons 1990 ) was highly signiﬁcant in all cases ( P \ 0 . 01 ) . Discussion Parameterized models of biophysical and mechanical cell properties become increasingly important for quantitative and predictive descriptions of cellular behavior . Our modeling framework , which included the concepts of tur - gor , membrane elasticity , intracellular osmolarity , osmoti - cally active volume , non - turgid volume , and solid cytosolic volume in a coherent and thermodynamically accurate way , enabled us to parameterize all these concepts con - sistently , by ﬁtting the relevant parameters to experimental data . In addition , it enabled us to discriminate between alternative hypotheses for turgor and volume changes by including alternative sub - models within the general framework . Even though the data sets were based on very different techniques , the overall conclusions are strikingly similar indicating that the proposed mathematical description is both accurate and universal . We conﬁrmed previous reports , which suggested an initial turgor pressure of around 0 . 6 MPa ( Smith et al . 2000b ; Meikle et al . 1988 ) . Turgor pressures reported for yeast differ substantially . Part of this variation might be because they have never been rigorously ﬁtted to data . In our study , we obtained similar results for data sets 1 – 3 . However , the initial turgor estimated from data set 4 was sixfold higher . We assume that this discrepancy is caused by different growth phases of yeast cells employed in the experiments . This explanation is supported by earlier reports , in which differences in turgor between cells in different physiological states were observed . Speciﬁcally , a higher turgor pressure was reported for cells in sta - tionary phase ( Smith et al . 2000c ; Martinez de Maranon et al . 1996 ) . After examining different possible explana - tions ( Eq . 3 ) , we conﬁrmed the hypothesis that turgor pressure is signiﬁcant only above a speciﬁc volume threshold , below which it can be neglected , as previously proposed ( Cosgrove 1981 ; Marechal and Gervais 1994 ; Klipp et al . 2005 ; Gennemark et al . 2006 ; Meikle et al . 1988 ) . Other forces potentially affecting the water potential , and therefore water ﬂux within the cell , can be neglected under the studied conditions of osmotic shock up to 1 . 5 M NaCl . We found values for the volumetric elastic modulus e between 6 and 29 MPa . We could not ﬁnd any published values of e for yeast . In a recent study , where yeast cells were subjected to mechanical compression , values of Fig . 5 Turgor - HOG pathway activation relationship . The x - axes are relative turgor ( % ) as predicted by the parameterized models for different shocks of NaCl ( dotted line in Fig . 3 ) . The y - axes are relative HOG pathway activation ( % ) according to different shocks of NaCl ( Fig . 4 ) . The black lines are a ﬁtted linear relationship ( y = a ? bx ) based on a weighted orthogonal regression . The gray lines represent the null hypothesis H 0 : y = 100 - x , i . e . , a direct 1 : 1 linear relationship between relative loss of turgor and relative HOG pathway activation . The insets are plots of the ( 25 , 50 , 75 , 90 , 95 % ) - conﬁdence regions of the respective estimated parameter pair ( a , b ) of a ? bx with the outermost line being the 95 % conﬁdence region . The black points correspond to the black lines in the plots , the gray points correspond to the gray lines . The conﬁdence regions are obtained by a Monte – Carlo analysis with 1 , 000 runs 1554 Eur Biophys J ( 2010 ) 39 : 1547 – 1556 123 Young’s modulus E for the cell wall of around 110 MPa were reported ( Smith et al . 2000a , c ) . Unfortunately , we could not relate these values to our volumetric elastic modulus , because those values for Young’s modulus E were derived assuming a Poisson’s ratio m of 0 . 5 and , hence , the formula E = 3 e ( 1 - 2 m ) was not applicable . We noted that cells in stationary phase ( data set 4 ) are estimated to be more rigid , i . e . , have a higher volumetric elastic modulus , but to a much lesser extent than in Smith et al . ( 2000c ) . The cells used in data set 1 were grown to saturation , i . e . , beyond proliferation , before they were re - suspended in fresh medium for 1 h before measurements . It is possible that they were still recovering from satura - tion phase and therefore had higher cell wall rigidity than cells from data sets 2 and 3 , which were measured at logarithmic growth phase . This reﬂects that e is a function of the physiological state of the cell . Thus , when turgor is being modeled over longer time intervals than in this study , the assumption of e being constant might be compromised . Our modeling results support the notion of a rather elastic cell wall , because the cell wall tightly follows the cell membrane on shrinkage , and plasmolysis only occurs under extremely high stresses . There is experimental evi - dence from mammalian cells that our model of an elastic membrane / cell wall surrounding a viscous medium is an over - simpliﬁcation ( Wang et al . 2001 ) . However , our model proved sufﬁcient to explain our data . More com - plicated models were not supported by the data in respect of the AICc . It is known that upon osmotic shock the actin cytoskeleton in yeast de - polymerizes ( Brewster and Gustin 1994 ) . This is in line with our results in which effects of the skeleton , which we included into the model of the matrix potential , were refuted by the model discrimination . A recent compression study of mammalian cells also ruled out the cytoskeleton as being responsible for the increase in cell stiffness as the volume decreases ( Zhou et al . 2009 ) . Other authors identiﬁed the concentration at which plasmolysis occurs as approximately 1 Osm / l ( Arnold and Lacy 1977 ) , but under different experimental conditions . The predicted plasmolysis point of 65 % in data set 4 was higher than the lowest volumes measured in the other data sets ( 44 – 54 % , Fig . 3 ) . Therefore , cells might have been at the threshold of plasmolysis in those experiments . Because no data were collected at higher stress levels this effect was not distinguishable by model selection . For the ﬁrst time , we provide evidence that there is direct link between loss of turgor upon osmotic shock and HOG pathway activation , not only qualitatively but also quantitatively . Moreover , the hypothesis of a direct 1 : 1 relationship between turgor loss and HOG pathway acti - vation could not be rejected . The physical basis of such a direct relationship remains elusive , but could for example be a change in Sln1 and Sho1 membrane protein conformation as a function of membrane stretch or other mechanical forces that relate to turgor .
