Gumucio 2 * and Jianping Fu 1 , 2 , 4 * Amniogenesis—the development of amnion—is a critical developmental milestone for early human embryogenesis and successful pregnancy 1 , 2 . However , human amniogenesis is poorly understood due to limited accessibility to peri - implantation embryos and a lack of in vitro models . Here we report an efficient biomaterial system to generate human amnion - like tissue invitro through self - organized development of human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) in a bioengineered niche mimicking the in vivo implantation environment . We show that biophysical niche factors act as a switch to toggle hPSC self - renewal versus amniogenesis under self - renewal - permissive biochemical conditions . We identify a unique molecular signature of hPSC - derived amnion - like cells and show that endogenously activated BMP – SMAD signalling is requiredfortheamnion - liketissuedevelopmentbyhPSCs . This study unveils the self - organizing and mechanosensitive nature of human amniogenesis and establishes the ﬁrst hPSC - based model for investigating peri - implantation human amnion development , thereby helping advance human embryology and reproductive medicine . During implantation of a human embryo , amnion cells ( amnioblasts ) are the first diﬀerentiated cell group emerging from an expanding pluripotent epiblast population and will give rise to a polarized squamous amniotic epithelium that encloses the amniotic cavity 1 , 2 ( Fig . 1a ) . Despite its basic and clinical significance , amnion development in humans is poorly understood due to limited studies on peri - implantation human embryos 2 and drastic diﬀerences in amniogenesis between human and other commonly used amniote models 1 , 3 . Even with recent progress in developing in vitro systems 4 , 5 , including in vitro - cultured human embryos 6 , 7 , for studying early human embryogenesis , the development of human amnion remains mysterious . Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) , which reside in a de - velopmental state similar to pluripotent epiblasts 8 , 9 , have been suc - cessfully utilized for modelling post - gastrulation human embry - onic development 4 , 10 . However , the applicability of hPSCs for mod - elling peri - implantation , pre - gastrulation developmental events , such as amniogenesis , remains undetermined . Here we adapted a biomimicry approach to engineer a biomaterial - based in vitro hPSC culture system for eﬃcient generation of early human amniotic tissue . Specifically , we constructed a biomimetic implantation - like niche for cultured hPSCs by implementing two major biophysical factors seen in the in vivo amniogenic niche : a three - dimensional ( 3D ) extracellular matrix ( ECM ) that is provided by the basement membrane surrounding the epiblast during implantation 11 ; and a soft tissue bed provided by the uterine wall and trophoblast to support the developing amnion ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Since amniogenesis ini - tiates from the expanding pluripotent epiblast , we utilized mTeSR1 medium and basement membrane matrix ( Geltrex ) to render the culture permissive for pluripotency maintenance . In this culture system , H9 human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) were plated as single cells at 30 , 000 cells cm − 2 onto a thick , soft gel bed of Geltrex ( with thickness ≥ 100 µ m , bulk Young’s modulus ∼ 900 Pa , coated on a glass coverslip ) , in mTeSR1 medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 ( Fig . 1b ) . At 24 h ( day 1 ) , medium containing Y27632 was replaced by fresh mTeSR1 supplemented with 4 % ( v / v ) Geltrex to establish a 3D implantation - like niche ( referred to henceforth as the ‘Gel - 3D’ condition ) . To assess the eﬀect of ECM dimensionality and matrix rigidity , respectively , several modifications of this Gel - 3D condition were tested ( Fig . 1b ) . First , the Geltrex supplement was excluded from the medium , with the gel bed retained ( referred to henceforth as the ‘Gel - 2D’ condition ) . Second , the soft gel bed was replaced by a 1 % Geltrex - coated glass coverslip ( referred to henceforth as the ‘Glass - 3D’ condition ) . Finally , a standard 2D culture , using a 1 % Geltrex - coated glass coverslip ( referred to henceforth as the ‘Glass - 2D’ condition ) , was examined as a control that maintains hPSC self - renewal . Culture medium was replenished daily . Analyses were performed at day 5 unless otherwise noted ( Fig . 1b ) . In the Glass - 2D condition , apico - basally polarized hESCcolonies were observed at day 5 . Strikingly , in the Gel - 2D , Glass - 3D and Gel - 3D conditions , hESCs formed 3D cysts with EZRIN + apical surfaces facing inward , reflecting the intrinsic lumenogenic property of hESCs 5 , 7 . In both Gel - 2D and Glass - 3D , > 90 % of lumenal cysts are made of tall , columnar E - CADHERIN + ( ECAD + ) epithelial cells with apico - basally elongated nuclei and thick epithelium ( Fig . 1c – e and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In distinct contrast , > 90 % of cysts formed in Gel - 3D show a squamous epithelial morphology featuring flattened , laterally elongated cell nuclei and reduced epithelium thickness , as well as unique ECAD + protrusions extending from basal surfaces ( Fig . 1c – e and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Notably , all 3D columnar epithelial cysts that formed in the Gel - 2D and Glass - 3D conditions express the pluripotency markers 1 Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , USA . 2 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , USA . 3 Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , Wayne State University , Detroit , Michigan 48202 , USA . 4 Department of Biomedical Engineering , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , USA . † These authors contributed equally to this work . * e - mail : dgumucio @ med . umich . edu ; jpfu @ umich . edu NATUREMATERIALS | VOL 16 | APRIL 2017 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 419 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

However , in squamous cysts that formed in Gel - 3D , expression of NANOG , OCT4 and SOX2 protein is lost , suggesting that they are composed of a diﬀerentiated cell type ( Fig . 1f , g ) . Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) analysis shows reduction in messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression for NANOG and SOX2 , but not OCT4 ( also known as POU5F1 ) , in Gel - 3D ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , suggesting a blunted transcriptional regulation of OCT4 . Despite loss of pluripotency markers , the squamous cyst maintains an epithelial phenotype , retaining expression of ECAD / CDH1 and CLDN6 ( ref . 12 ; Fig . 1d , g and Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . This spontaneously diﬀerentiated squamous epithelial cystic tissue is morphologically reminiscent of the developing amnion in peri - implantation human embryos 1 , 2 . The development of squamous cysts is characterized by concurrent changes in morphology and cell fate ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . From days 2 – 4 , the majority of cysts in Gel - 3D transitioned from columnar to squamous morphology and lose NANOG and OCT4 expression .

For the squamous cyst formed in three dimensions on 8 . 4 - µ m - tall microposts , confocal micrographs taken at two planes passing the middle ( P1 ) and bottom ( P2 ) of the cyst ( white dashed lines in a ) are shown . The yellow square highlights ECAD + protrusions ( white arrowheads ) at the interface between the cyst and microposts . n = 3 independent experiments . Scale bar , 50 µ m . was also observed in two additional hESC lines ( UM63 - 1 and H7 ) and a hiPSC line ( 1196a ) cultured in Gel - 3D , but not under the Glass - 2D , Gel - 2D or Glass - 3D conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Thus , uniquely among all conditions examined , the implantation - like Gel - 3D biophysical niche is both necessary and suﬃcient for eﬃciently inducing self - organized development of hPSCs to a cystic epithelial tissue with amnion - like squamous morphology , under biochemical conditions that permit hPSC self - renewal . Furthermore , the development of squamous cysts in Gel - 3D is inhibited as the thickness of the gel bed is decreased to 60 µ m or 20 µ m , a modulation known to increase apparent substrate rigidity 13 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Together , these findings support the notion that the mechanical rigidity and the 3D dimensionality of the ECM are integrated to trigger hPSC diﬀerentiation to an amnion - like tissue . To further confirm the physical niche dependency of hPSC morphogenic cytodiﬀerentiation , we adopted an artificial matrix , made of a regular array of elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) microposts 14 whose height can be precisely modulated to control substrate rigidity and surface area ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Consistently , development of squamous cysts occurred only in hPSCs cultured on 8 . 4 - µ m - tall microposts ( a soft matrix ) , but not on 0 . 7 - µ m - tall microposts or on flat PDMS surfaces ( rigid matrices ) , even though all included a 3D Geltrex overlay ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Interestingly , hPSCs cultured on soft 8 . 4 - µ m - tall microposts in 2D ( that is , without the Geltrex overlay ) did not form cysts ( Fig . 2 ) , in contrast to columnar cysts formed in Gel - 2D ( Fig . 1c ) . The mechanism underlying such diﬀerential morphogenesis of hPSCs is unclear . We next examined the molecular signature of hPSC - derived squamous cysts and compared it with other embryonic and extra - embryonic lineages possibly existing in a peri - implantation embryo , including primitive streak ( PS ) , neuroectoderm , primitive endoderm ( PE ) / hypoblast , trophectoderm ( TE ) / trophoblast , primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , and amnion . Primitive streak development is associated with an epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) accompanied by upregulation of transcription factors including BRACHYURY ( BRA ) , SNAIL and SLUG ( ref . 15 ) . Indeed , basal protrusions observed in squamous cysts ( Fig . 1d ) suggest the possible involvement of EMT . Compared with control hPSCs in Glass - 2D , upregulation of BRA / BRA and SLUG / SNAI2 , but not SNAIL / SNAI1 , were observed in squamous cysts in Gel - 3D ; no upregulation of these transcription factors was seen in the Gel - 2D or Glass - 3D conditions ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . In contrast , hPSC - derived PS cells ( via a 2D culture protocol 16 ; referred to henceforth as PS - 2D cells ) showed upregulation of BRA / BRA , SNAIL / SNAI1 and SLUG / SNAI2 ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . PS - 2D cells also showed a decrease in ECAD / CDH1 and loss of ECAD organization , accompanied by increased NCAD / CDH2 ; none of these changes were seen in squamous cysts in Gel - 3D ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . These data suggest that while PS - 2D cells exhibit molecular signatures of canonical EMT ( Fig . 3c ) , squamous cyst development activates a unique subset of EMT - related transcription factors , notably without SNAIL , and elicits a columnar - to - squamous epithelium transition with ECAD / NCAD regulation distinct from that observed in canonical EMT and PS lineage diﬀerentiation ( Fig . 3d ) .

Absence of SOX2—a marker of human neuroepithelium 17 —in squamous cysts ( Figs 1f , g and 2 ) excludes the neuroectodermal lineage . PE / hypoblast markers GATA4 and GATA6 ( ref . 6 ) werenot upregulatedin squamouscysts , compared with hPSCs , excluding the PE lineage ( Fig . 4a ) . A recent publication suggests that in cynomolgus monkey embryos , PGCs are NANOG + / OCT4 + / SOX17 + and emigrate from the amnion by canonical EMT 18 . However , none of NANOG / OCT4 / SOX17 , nor canonical EMT , was detected in squamous cysts ( Figs 1f , g and 3a and Supplementary Fig . 3c ; data not shown for SOX17 ) . Therefore , the squamous cysts do not appear to match the characteristics of PGCs . It remains a future goal to determine whether PGCs can be derived from squamous cysts under suitable conditions . Interestingly , several TE / trophoblast markers— GATA2 , GATA3 , CDX2 and TP63 ( refs 6 , 19 ) —were highly upregulated in squamous cysts compared with hPSC colonies and columnar cysts ( Fig . 4b ) . However , other known trophoblast markers— KRT7 , CGA and HLA - G ( refs 19 , 20 ) —were not upregulated in squamous cysts ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . The squamous cysts showed heterogeneous staining of CDX2 and GATA3 , which co - localize with BRA ( Supplementary Fig . 8b , c ) , combinations not seen in hPSC - derived trophoblasts 19 . SSEA - 4 , a surface antigen associated with the inner cell mass , but not TE ( ref . 21 ) , is also retained in squamous cysts ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . Importantly , other studies have reported GATA2 , GATA3 ( refs 19 , 22 ) and SSEA - 4 ( refs 1 , 23 ) expression in human amnion . Together , these results contradict known molecular features of trophoblasts , and suggest that the hPSC - derived squamous cystic tissue resembles early human amnion . Consistently , mRNA expression of a set of key fate - identifying genes recently reported for first - trimester human amnion— ITGB6 , VTCN1 , GABRP and MUC16 ( ref . 22 ) —are all significantly upreg - ulated in squamous cysts compared with control hPSCs ( Fig . 4c ) . Additionally , squamous cysts exhibit upregulated expression of HAND1 , POSTN , TFAP2A and TFAP2B ( Fig . 4d ) ; HAND1 , POSTN and TFAP2A are markers for early mouse amnion 24 , and POSTN , TFAP2A and TFAP2B are reported first - trimester human amnion markers 22 , 24 , 25 . The squamous cysts also show upregulation of KRT17 and KRT18 ( Fig . 4e ) , which are observed in week - 10 human am - nion 26 . Together , these data demonstrate that , among all of the candidate lineages , the hPSC - derived squamous cysts exhibit a molecular signature most closely matching known aspects of human amnion at the first trimester ( for example , week 9 – 10 ) , the earliest stage reported so far in the literature . To establish the transcriptome of the hPSC - derived amnion - like tissue ( referred to henceforth as hPSC - amnion ) , we performed RNA - sequencing ( RNA - seq ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Although the transcriptome of hPSC - amnion diﬀers substantially from that of control hPSCs , expression levels of a cohort of putative pluripotency genes 27 are remarkably similar in both ; only CUZD1 and CCL26 are substantially downregulated in hPSC - amnion compared with control hPSCs ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 ) . This observation suggests that hPSC - amnion develops with only 422 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved .

This revealed a gene set uniquely enriched in hPSC - amnion and relatively depleted in hPSCs and other extra - embryonic tissues ( Fig . 4g ) , probably reflecting the fact that the peri - implantation stage represented by hPSC - amnion is developmentally earlier than previously examined amnion samples 19 , 22 , 25 . We also compared genes enriched in hPSC - amnion with recently reported single - cell transcriptomes of 197 non - amniotic cells obtained from post - implantation monkey embryos 9 . This analysis did not reveal any monkey cell that either displays transcriptomic similarity to hPSC - amnion ( data not shown ) or is double - positive for the hPSC - amnion markers ITGB6 and VTCN1 , supporting that hPSC - amnion represents a distinct lineage . We note that hPSC - amnion , which resembles the initial stage of amnion development , is the end - point phenotype in the current culture system ( data not shown ) , suggesting that it may require additional factors for further development of the amnion - like tissue in vitro . We also performed gene ontology ( GO ) functional annotation clustering for genes enriched in hPSC - amnion . GO terms for genes enriched in 9 - week human amnion as well as human chorion and placenta were similarly clustered . Strikingly , the three most enriched annotation clusters in hPSC - amnion were transcription factors , primarily those of the homeobox classes ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Interestingly , HOX genes comprised the highest ranked cluster in 9 - week amnion as well ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Among genes enriched in hPSC - amnion were several potential BMP targets including DLX5 / 6 and EVX1 ( Fig . 4g ) .

Scale bars in a , d , 50 µ m . the ALK pathway , which is associated with BMP signalling , in hPSC - amnion compared with hPSCs ( Supplementary Fig . 10 and Supplementary Table 5 ) . Indeed , we observe prominent nuclear staining and upregulated protein level of phosphorylated SMAD1 / 5 ( pSMAD1 / 5 ) , a downstream target of BMP – SMAD signalling , in hPSC - amnion , but not in other conditions ( Fig . 5a , b ) . It suggests that BMP – SMAD signalling is activated during hPSC - amnion development , consistent with findings in early mouse and primate embryos 18 , 24 , 28 . Consistently , both RNA - seq ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and qRT - PCR analysis ( Fig . 5c ) show upregulated BMP2 / 4 / 7 in hPSC - amnion . Western blotting further confirms increased BMP4 protein level in hPSC - amnion ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) , suggesting endogenously activated BMP production during the development of hPSC - amnion . To examine whether BMP – SMAD signalling is required for hPSC - amnion development , hPSCs cultured in Gel - 3D were treated with a small - molecule inhibitor LDN193189 ( LDN ) , which inhibits ALK2 / 3 receptors that bind to BMP2 / 4 / 7 . Strikingly , treatments with LDN ( on day 2 alone or on both days 2 and 3 ) inhibited hPSC - amnion development ( Fig . 5d and Supplementary Fig . 11b , c ) . The development of hPSC - amnion is also inhibited by treatment with NOGGIN , a protein that antagonizes BMP2 / 4 / 7 ( Supplementary Fig . 11d , e ) . These results implicate the requirement of BMP – SMAD signalling for hPSC - amnion development . It remains to be determined how physical signals from the 3D implantation - like niche activate BMP – SMAD signalling to elicit hPSC - amnion development . In this work , we report a biomimetic implantation - like niche for hPSCs to model human amniogenesis—a key developmental step previously not accessible to study . We demonstrated that amniotic development by hPSCs is a self - organizing process that occurs in the absence of biochemical inductive cues from a maternal or extra - embryonic source . Rather , physical signals from the implantation - like niche are necessary and suﬃcient to trigger the development of amnion - like tissue in a BMP - dependent manner . Interestingly , while the squamous hPSC - amnion reported here closely resembles human amnion tissue from morphological and transcriptomic perspectives , it does not fully recapitulate the patterned tissue morphologies of the peri - implantation human embryo , possibly due to diﬀerences in the dynamics of amnion formation in vitro versus in vivo . In addition to advancing fundamental understanding of human amnion development and expanding the application of hPSCs to model peri - implantation human embryogenesis , this eﬃcient hPSC - based 3D amniogenic system could be leveraged 424 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

D . Smith at the University of Michigan MStem Cell Laboratories ; NIH registration number : 0277 ) , and 1196a ( an iPSC line , P42 , from the University of Michigan Pluripotent Stem Cell Core 29 ) . All protocols for the use of hPSC lines were approved by the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee at the University of Michigan . All hPSC lines have been authenticated by the original sources and also authenticated in - house by immunostaining for pluripotency markers and successful diﬀerentiation to three germ layer cells . All hPSC lines were maintained in a feeder - free system for at least 10 passages and authenticated as karyotypically normal at the indicated passage number . Karyotype analysis was performed by Cell Line Genetics . All hPSC lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination ( LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cell culture . hPSCs were maintained in a standard feeder - free culture system using mTeSR1 medium ( STEMCELL Technologies ) and lactate dehydrogenase - elevating virus ( LDEV ) - free hESC - qualified reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix Geltrex ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; derived from Engelbreth - Holm – Swarm tumours similarly as Matrigel ) per the manufacturers’ instructions . All cultures were visually examined during every passage to ensure the absence of spontaneously diﬀerentiated , mesenchymal - like cells in the culture . All hPSCs were used before reaching P70 . 3D amniogenesis assay and BMP inhibition assay . Three diﬀerent kinds of substrate were used in this study : glass coverslip coated with 1 % Geltrex solution for 1h at room temperature , Geltrex beds of diﬀerent nominal thicknesses ( as described below ) , and artificial matrices of diﬀerent eﬀective rigidities ( as described below ) . Cultured hPSC colonies were first incubated with Accutase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37 ◦ C for 10min before being triturated and suspended in PBS as single cells . hPSCs were then centrifuged and the cell pellet was resuspended in mTeSR1 containing 10 µ M Y27632 ( Tocris ) , a ROCK inhibitor that prevents dissociation - induced apoptosis 30 . hPSCs were plated as single cells at 30 , 000 cells cm − 2 onto the indicated substrate . After 24h ( on day 1 ) , culture medium was changed to fresh mTeSR1 without Y27632 . For 3D culture conditions , 4 % ( v / v ) Geltrex was supplemented in mTeSR1 medium on day 1 , as previously described 5 . Thereafter , mTeSR1 medium was replenished daily , and 4 % ( v / v ) Geltrex was supplemented daily for all 3D culture conditions . In the small - molecule inhibitor treatment assays , 500 nM BMP inhibitor LDN193189 ( LDN ; STEMCELL Technologies ) was added to the culture medium , either on day 2 alone or on both days 2 and 3 . Dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to control groups on both days 2 and 3 . In experimental groups treated with LDN on day 2 alone , DMSO was supplemented on day 3 . No LDN or DMSO was added to the culture medium on days other than those specified above . In the NOGGIN treatment assay , 500ngml − 1 human recombinant NOGGIN ( R & D Systems ; reconstituted in PBS ) was added to the culture medium for the experimental group from day 0 to day 5 . PBS was added to the control group . Derivation of primitive streak cells . Primitive streak ( PS ) cells were derived from hPSCs according to a previously published protocol 16 . In brief , hPSCs ( H9 line ) were dissociated and plated as single cells at 20 , 000 cells cm − 2 onto glass coverslips coated with 1 % Geltrex solution in mTeSR1 medium containing 10 µ M Y27632 . After 24h ( on day 1 ) , culture medium was replaced by fresh mTeSR1 without Y27632 . On day 2 , mTeSR1 was replaced by PS - diﬀerentiation medium containing Essential 6 medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 20ngml − 1 FGF2 ( Peprotech ) , and 8 µ M CHIR99021 ( Tocris ) . PS cell diﬀerentiation was induced for 48h before performing downstream assays . Fabrication of basement membrane matrix gel beds . The fabrication protocol for the Geltrex gel bed was based on a ‘sandwich’ set - up previously developed for generating polyacrylamide gel substrates 13 , 31 , 32 . To prepare a substrate that the gel bed could attach to , a 22 × 22mm 2 glass coverslip was first treated with air plasma ( Harrick Plasma ) for 2min before being coated with 0 . 1mgml − 1 poly - ( L - lysine ) ( PLL ) solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min , and 1 % glutaraldehyde solution ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) for another 30 min . To prepare a substrate that could ‘sandwich’ and release the gel bed , a pre - cleaned glass slide was treated with air plasma for 2min before being coated with 0 . 1mgml − 1 poly - ( L - lysine ) - graft - poly - ( ethylene glycol ) ( PLL - g - PEG ; SuSoS ) solution for 1h . To obtain gel beds with nominal thicknesses of 20 , 60 and 100 µ m , undiluted Geltrex ( 10 , 30 and 50 µ l , respectively ) was sandwiched between the pre - treated glass coverslip and glass slide on ice before being incubated at 37 ◦ C for 30min for gelation . The gel bed , which was attached to the glass coverslip , was then removed from the glass slide and submerged in DMEM / F12 medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and incubated at 37 ◦ C overnight before plating cells . To prepare gel beds with a nominal thickness larger than 100 µ m , spacers with the desired thickness were placed between the glass coverslip and the glass slide when preparing the gel bed sandwich . Specifically , spacers were made of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ; Dow Corning ) films . The film was made by spin - coating liquid - phase PDMS ( mixed at 10 : 1 of base / curing agent ratio ) onto a Petri dish at 500r . p . m . for 40s ( for generating 150 - µ m - thick film ) and cured at 70 ◦ C for at least 24h before use . A previously published ‘PDMS film thickness - spin coating parameter’ chart 33 can be referred to when preparing PDMS films of desired thicknesses . Fabrication of elastomeric artificial matrices . The elastomeric artificial matrix consisted of a regular PDMS micropost array generated using a microfabrication protocol previously published 14 . To functionalize inert PDMS surfaces for cell attachment , the PDMS micropost array was treated with air plasma for 2min and coated with 1 % Geltrex solution for 2h . The Geltrex solution was aspirated , and the PDMS micropost array was rinsed with DMEM / F12 before plating hPSCs . Finite - element analysis was performed to determine the nominal spring constant , K , of the PDMS micropost under lateral force applied at the micropost top as previously described 34 . The nominal spring constant K was converted to an eﬀective in - plane substrate rigidity E eﬀ , by E eﬀ = 9K / 2 π D ( ref . 35 ) , where D = 1 . 83 µ m was the micropost diameter . Cell fixation and immunocytochemistry . hPSCs were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( buﬀered in 1 × PBS ) for 30min , and permeabilized in 0 . 1 % SDS ( sodium dodecyl sulfate , dissolved in PBS ) solution for another 30min . Samples were first incubated in 2 % goat serum solution ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 4 ◦ C for 24h , and then with primary antibody solution prepared in 2 % goat serum at 4 ◦ C for another 24h . Samples were then labelled with goat - raised secondary antibodies ( 1 : 500 ) at 4 ◦ C for 24h . Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used for counterstaining the cell nucleus . Alexa - Fluor dye - conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used as a pan - cell membrane marker . All primary antibodies , their sources , and dilutions are listed in Supplementary Table 6 . Confocal microscopy and image analysis . Images were acquired on an Olympus 1X81 fluorescence microscope equipped with a CSU - X1 spinning - disc unit ( YOKOGAWA ) or a Nikon - A1 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Nikon ) . Fluorescence images acquired from confocal microscopy were reconstructed in three dimensions using Imaris8 . 2 ( Bitplane ) . Scanning electron microscopy . The PDMS micropost array was mounted on a stub and sputter - coated with gold palladium . Samples were observed and photographed using a Philips XL20 scanning electron microscope ( Phillips ) . Cell and cyst morphology characterization . Measurements of cell nucleus dimensions and cyst epithelial thickness were performed manually using the Measurement tool in ImageJ ( NIH ) 36 . The normalized nucleus dimension , defined as the ratio of nucleus dimension along the apico - basal direction to that along the lateral direction , was then calculated . The distance between the apical and basal surfaces ( both stained by WGA ) of the epithelium was measured at five diﬀerent positions evenly distributed along the circumference of the cyst . The average of these five measurements was calculated as the cyst epithelial thickness and was plotted as one data point in Fig . 1e . Total RNA isolation and qRT - PCR analysis . Samples were collected and prepared for RNA isolation following a protocol commonly used for processing in vivo tissues . In brief , samples were washed with DMEM / F12 to remove ECM overlay . Cysts ( about 5 , 000 or more per sample ) were then scraped from the culture substrate , before being spun down at 1 , 000r . p . m . for 3min in a conical tube . RNA was isolated from the cell pellet using an RNeasy Micro Kit ( QIAGEN ) following the manufacturer’s instruction . RNA quality and quantity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific ) . Reverse transcription was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit ( Bio - Rad ) . qRT - PCR analysis was performed using Quantitect Sybr Green MasterMix ( QIAGEN ) and specific primers ( as listed in Supplementary Table 7 ) on a CFX Connect Real - Time System ( Bio - Rad ) . The qRT - PCR result was considered as ‘not detected’ when no signal was observed within 40 cycles . Human GAPDH was used as an internal control for quantifying relative gene expression by using the 2 − (cid:49) Ct method 37 . All analyses were performed with 2 – 3 technical replicates and ≥ 3 biological replicates as described in the figure captions . The investigator who performed the qRT - PCR analysis was blinded to the test condition allocation during the experiment . All qRT - PCR results are summarized and tabulated in Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 . Western blotting . Whole - cell lysates were prepared from cells and homogenized by sonication . Proteins in lysates were separated via SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) before transferring to PVDF membranes . PVDF membranes were then incubated with blocking buﬀer ( Li - Cor ) for 1h and then with primary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 6 ) at 4 ◦ C overnight with gentle © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Blots were then incubated with IRDye secondary antibodies ( Li - Cor ) for 1h before imaging using the Li - Cor Odyssey Sa Infrared Imaging System ( Li - Cor ) . The investigator who performed the western blotting was blinded to the test condition allocation during the experiment . RNA - sequencing and data analysis . mRNA - sequencing was performed by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core following Illumina guidelines . The investigator who performed the sequencing was blinded to the test condition allocation during the experiment . RNA samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq - 2500 High - Output system generating 50 - cycle single reads . Samples were barcoded and run on a single lane . Publicly available RNA - seq data ( GSE66302 ) were downloaded from GEO . Reads were mapped to the human reference genome ( Build hg19 ) using STAR 38 and tabulated using HTSeq 39 . Diﬀerential RNA expression was determined using edgeR 40 . Normalized levels of gene expression and the colour scale ( Fig . 4f , g ) were determined by scaling raw reads for each gene to account for diﬀerent total read counts across samples before values were log 2 transformed . Raw and processed data files have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO , accession number GSE89479 ) . Cluster analysis . Hierarchical clustering analysis of transcript expression data was performed within Cluster 3 . 0 using uncentred correlation with average linkage 41 . Java Treeview was used for visualizing the clustered data 42 . Gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis . Quality check of the data was conducted using the Trinity toolkit ( https : / / github . com / trinityrnaseq / trinityrnaseq / wiki / QC - Samples - and - Replicates ) 43 . Diﬀerential expression analysis was carried out for hPSC - amnion , 9 - week human amnion , human chorion , and human placenta , respectively , relative to hPSCs , with the DESeq2 package ( https : / / www . bioconductor . org / packages / release / bioc / html / DESeq2 . html ) 44 . The output ( . DE _ results ) were converted to an Excel format , sorted by log 2 fold change and used as a unified set for GO enrichment analysis by DAVID , v6 . 8 ( https : / / david . ncifcrf . gov ) . Gene set enrichment analysis . Genes were ranked by fold change in expression level relative to hPSCs . The entire ranked data set shown in Supplementary Table 1 ( that is , genes enriched and depleted in amnion - like cysts ) was queried for 35 genes of the ALK - pathway - related gene set , BIOCARTA _ ALK _ PATHWAY , using the gene set enrichment analysis software ( http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / gsea ) and the Molecular Signature Database ( MSigDB ) 45 .
