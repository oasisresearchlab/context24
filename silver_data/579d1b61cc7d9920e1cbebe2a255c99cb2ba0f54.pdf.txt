Nurseries , however , remained fully open . COVID‑19 outbreaks ( ≥ 2 laboratory‑confirmed cases within 14 days ) in nurseries were investigated to assess the risk of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection and cumulative incidence in staff and children over a three‑month period when community SARS‑CoV‑2 infections rates were high and the Alpha variant was spreading rapidly across England . Methods : This was a cross‑sectional national investigation of COVID‑19 outbreaks in nurseries across England . Nurs‑ eries reporting a COVID‑19 outbreak to PHE between November 2020 and January 2021 were requested to complete a questionnaire about their outbreak . Results : Three hundred and twenty‑four nurseries , comprising 1 % ( 324 / 32 , 852 ) of nurseries in England , reported a COVID‑19 outbreak . Of the 315 ( 97 % ) nurseries contacted , 173 ( 55 % ) reported 1 , 657 SARS‑CoV‑2 cases , including 510 ( 31 % ) children and 1 , 147 ( 69 % ) staff . A child was the index case in 45 outbreaks ( 26 % ) and staff in 125 ( 72 % ) outbreaks . Overall , children had an incidence rate of 3 . 50 % ( 95 % CI , 3 . 21 – 3 . 81 % ) and was similar irrespective of whether the index case was a child ( 3 . 55 % ; 95 % CI , 3 . 01 – 4 . 19 % ) or staff ( 3 . 44 % ; 95 % CI , 3 . 10 – 3 . 82 % ) . Among staff , cumulative incidence was lower if the index case was a child ( 26 . 28 % ; 95 % CI , 23 . 54 – 29 . 21 % % ) compared to a staff member ( 32 . 98 % ; 95 % CI , © The Author ( s ) 2022 .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1845 Background The rapid spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , the virus responsible for COVID - 19 , forced many countries to impose national lockdowns [ 1 ] , including closure of educational settings [ 2 ] . In England , the first imported cases of SARS - CoV - 2 were identified in January 2020 and increased rapidly in early March , leading to school closures on 20 March and nationwide lockdown from 23 March 2020 [ 3 ] . Cases increased until mid - April , then declined in subsequent weeks and remained low across all age - groups during the summer months [ 3 , 4 ] , allowing full attendance for all children into educational settings in September 2020 [ 4 ] . Compared to adults , children have been reported to have a lower risk of symptomatic disease , hospitalisation or death [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . The vast majority of children infected with SARS - CoV - 2 remain asymptomatic or develop a mild , transient illness [ 6 , 7 ] . Whilst the benefits of chil - dren returning to school on their educational attainment , physical , mental , emotional and social well - being can - not be denied [ 8 – 11 ] , the full reopening of schools raised the potential for widespread SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in educational settings [ 12 ] , with possible spill - over into households of students and staff and the wider commu - nity , or vice - versa [ 13 ] . From mid - August 2020 and prior to schools reopening to all students , SARS - CoV - 2 infections started increasing nationally , first in adults and then in children , leading to a second national lockdown during November 2020 , whilst keeping educational settings fully open . SARS - CoV - 2 cases subsequently declined , first in adults and then in school - aged children [ 4 ] . The emergence of a novel , more transmissible variant of concern ( Alpha , VOC - 202012 / 01 or B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) , however , was associated with rapid increases in SARS - CoV - 2 infection rates across England from late November 2020 [ 14 ] , leading to a third national lock - down in January 2021 , which included restricted primary and secondary school attendance for children of key - workers and vulnerable children [ 4 ] . Nurseries , however , remained open to all children because the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and transmission in infants and toddlers was considered to be very low [ 4 , 15 ] . Compared to primary and secondary schools , nurser - ies provide a different challenge from an infection control perspective . The premises are often much smaller , with a higher staff - to - child ratio , and the very young age of the children makes physical distancing from staff unfeasible [ 16 , 17 ] . Public Health England ( PHE ) , therefore , initiated rapid national investigation of COVID - 19 outbreaks in nurseries to assess the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and cumulative incidence in staff and children over a three - month period when community SARS - CoV - 2 infections rates were high and the Alpha variant was spreading rapidly across England [ 18 ] . We also compared trends in SARS - CoV - 2 infections rates in nurseries with national surveillance data for children and adults in England . Methods In England , educational settings are regularly provided with updated guidance on infection control measures , including recommendations for good ventilation , regu - lar hand - sanitising , social distancing , and enhanced cleaning ; face masks and face coverings are not recom - mended for staff or children in nurseries [ 19 , 20 ] . All individuals , including staff and children , have access to free community SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR testing if they develop COVID - 19 symptoms ( fever , new continuous cough , loss of test / smell ) . Cases and their close contacts must isolate for 10 days . Outbreaks reported to PHE are routinely recorded in HPZone [ 21 ] , an online national case management system used by local health protection teams ( HPTs ) to record events that require public health management . Outbreak investigation We used the same methodology to investigate COVID - 19 outbreaks in nurseries as for primary and secondary school outbreaks , defined as “ ≥ 2 laboratory - confirmed cases within 14 days” [ 22 ] . “Nurseries” , also known as early years settings , includes all non - domestic set - tings which offer care for children from birth to 5 years , after which time they start formal education in school . Childminders and babysitters were not included . Briefly , 31 . 19 – 34 . 82 % ) , with the highest cumulative incidence when the index case was also a staff member ( 37 . 52 % ; 95 % CI , 35 . 39 – 39 . 70 % ) . Compared to November 2020 , outbreak sizes and cumulative incidence was higher in January 2021 , when the Alpha variant predominated . Nationally , SARS‑CoV‑2 infection rates in < 5 year‑olds remained low and fol‑ lowed trends in older age‑groups , increasing during December 2020 and declining thereafter . Conclusions : In this cross‑sectional study of COVID‑19 outbreaks in nurseries , one in three staff were affected compared to one in thirty children . There was some evidence of increased transmissibility and higher cumulative incidence associated with the Alpha variant , highlighting the importance of maintaining a low level of community infections .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1845 because HPZone contains very limited information on individual outbreaks , nurseries reporting a COVID - 19 outbreak between 02 November 2020 and 31 January 2021 were contacted between 08 and 23 February 2021 to provide detailed information about the outbreak , either by telephone or completing an online questionnaire using SnapSurvey v . 11 . Collected information included the size and structure of bubbles ( defined as a group of staff and children who performed all activities together and did not interact with other bubbles ) and the degree of con - tact between staff with other staff and with children . Staff were considered to have “direct contact” with chil - dren if they had a childminding or other roles requiring close contact with children . Those in other roles , such as administration , were considered to have “no direct con - tact” with children . Data analysis Data were analysed using R studio ( version 1 . 3 . 1056 ) and Stata v . 15 . 1 ( Statacorp , Tx ) , and are mainly descriptive . The start of an outbreak was taken as the symptom onset date in the index PCR - confirmed case or , for asympto - matic cases , their date of PCR sample . Denominators for staff and children by age - group and bubble were reported by individual nurseries . Denominators for the number of nurseries and educational settings in England were estimated using the total number of possible settings for different age - groups . A setting with a combination of nurseries , primary or secondary schools was counted separately for each setting ( Source : Department for Edu - cation ) [ 23 ] . The proportion of cases due to the Alpha variant in England was obtained from national surveil - lance reports [ 24 ] . We assessed the impact of the Alpha variant by analysing changes in the number and size of nursery outbreaks as well as case numbers and cumula - tive incidence in staff and children during November 2020 ( when the Alpha variant was responsible for < 20 % of confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections in England ) , December 2020 ( 20 – 80 % ) and January 2021 ( > 80 % ) . Non - normal continuous data are described as medians with interquartile ranges . Proportions were compared using the chi - squared or Fisher’s Exact test . Cumulative incidence was calculated by dividing the number of cases by the population under investigation and compared using Fisher’s Exact probability tests via the prop . test function in R studio ( version 1 . 3 . 1056 ) [ 25 ] . Cumulative incidence was compared by source of index case . Analy - ses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons . Ethical review and informed consent PHE has legal permission , provided by Regulation 3 of The Health Service ( Control of Patient Information ) Reg - ulations 2002 , to process patient confidential information for national surveillance of communicable diseases and as such , individual patient consent and approval from an ethics committee is not required . Results Between 02 November 2020 ( week 45 ) and 31 January 2021 ( week 4 ) , 324 nurseries reported a COVID - 19 out - break to PHE , comprising 1 . 0 % ( 324 / 32 , 852 ) of nurser - ies across England ( Fig . 1a ) . The number of outbreaks peaked in early November , then declined until end of December before increasing again in January and declin - ing again from mid - February to the end of April 2021 . ( Fig . 1b ) . Between 09 and 23 February 2021 , 315 ( 97 % ) nurser - ies were contacted and 181 ( 57 % ) completed the survey . Eight settings provided insufficient information ; there - fore , 173 nurseries from all English regions were included in the analysis ( Fig . 1a ) . There were 1 , 657 SARS - CoV - 2 cases , including 510 ( 31 % ) children and 1 , 147 ( 69 % ) staff linked to these outbreaks . A median of 8 ( IQR : 5 – 13 ; range 2 – 33 ) individuals were affected per outbreak ( Table 1 ) . Nurseries reporting an outbreak organised their children and staff into anywhere between 1 – 10 bub - bles . Of the 171 that reported their bubble setup , 42 % ( 72 / 171 ) of outbreaks occurred across > 3 bubbles , 33 % ( 56 / 171 ) involved two bubbles and 25 % ( 43 / 171 ) involved one bubble ( Supplement Table S1 ) . Overall , 99 settings closed at least once because of the outbreak ( 4 closed twice , 1 closed 3 times ) , 96 of which reported how long they closed for : up to one week ( 28 nurseries ) , 7 – 13 days ( 33 nurseries ) or 14 – 28 days ( 35 nurseries ) . A child was the index case in 45 outbreaks ( 45 / 173 , 26 % ) and a staff member in 125 ( 125 / 173 , 72 % ) ( Table 2 ) . Having COVID - 19 symptoms was the most common reason for testing in the first four cases of each outbreak ( 411 / 603 , 68 % ) , fol - lowed by being a contact of a nursery case ( 92 / 603 , 15 % ) and being a contact of a household case ( 58 / 603 , 10 % ) ( Supplement Table S4 ) . There were 28 hospitalisations , including one child , and no deaths . Cumulative incidence in staff and students Overall , children had an cumulative incidence of 3 . 50 % ( 95 % CI , 3 . 21 – 3 . 81 % ) compared to 30 . 92 % ( 95 % CI , 29 . 44 – 32 . 44 % ) among staff ( Table 1 ) . In children , SARS - CoV - 2 cumulative incidence was highest in the < 1 year - olds ( 5 . 76 % ; 95 % CI , 4 . 08 – 8 . 04 % ) and decreased with age , with 4 year - olds having the lowest cumulative incidence ( 2 . 75 % ; 95 % CI , 2 . 10 – 3 . 58 % ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Staff with direct con - tact with children had the highest cumulative incidence ( 32 . 94 % ; 95 % CI , 31 . 30 – 34 . 62 % ) , followed by staff with no direct contact ( 20 . 20 % , 95 % CI , 17 . 08 – 23 . 72 % ) ( Table 1 ) . Cumulative incidence was lowest in children , irrespec - tive of whether the index case was a child ( 3 . 55 % ; 95 % CI , Page 4 of 10 Aiano et al .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1845 affected per outbreak and cumulative incidence in chil - dren and staff was all higher in January 2021 , when nearly all cases were due to the Alpha variant nationally , while the number of reported outbreaks were similar ( 64 vs . 66 ) for these two months ( Table 1 ) . Facilities , social distancing and infection control measures Nurseries experiencing a COVID - 19 outbreak reported that 49 % ( 85 / 172 ) of their staff members were able to maintain physical distancing between each other most of the time throughout the day , while 39 . 5 % ( 68 / 172 ) reported social distancing “rarely” , “never” or “some of the time” . Within individual bubbles , nurseries reported that 74 % ( 127 / 172 ) of children were “never” able to maintain physical distancing with each other , and 64 % ( 110 / 172 ) staff were “never” able to maintain physical distancing with children ( Supplement Table S2 ) . Across bubbles , 50 % ( 83 / 166 ) of nurseries reported that their staff members were able to maintain physical distancing from staff in other bubbles all the time throughout the day , and 61 % ( 102 / 166 ) of children were able to maintain physical distancing from children from other bubbles “all of the time” ( Supplement Table S2 ) . Around two - thirds of nurseries had shared staff rooms ( 111 / 170 , 65 % ) and 78 % ( 131 / 169 ) had shared bathrooms used by staff members across different bubbles . Most settings had designated eating spaces ( 146 / 169 , 86 % ) and bathrooms for children ( 112 / 168 , 67 % ) , assigned per bub - ble ( Supplement Table S3 ) . In 57 % ( 99 / 173 ) of nurser - ies , staff were reported not to provide cross - cover across bubbles . National surveillance Nationally , weekly SARS - CoV - 2 infection rates were lowest in children aged < 5 years and followed the same trends as the older age - groups ( Fig . 3a and b ) . Thus , cases in children aged < 5 years increased slowly following the full reopening of all schools in September 2020 ( week 36 ) and declined during the national lockdown in November 2020 when educational settings remained fully open to all students . Cases then increased from late November 2020 , following the emergence of the Alpha variant in England until the end of 2020 before declining . In January and February 2021 , when England was experiencing its third national lockdown , cases across all age - groups , includ - ing < 5 year - olds , continued to decline , at a time when nurseries remained open while primary and secondary schools had restricted attendance and in - person teach - ing for vulnerable children and children of key workers . Among < 5 year - olds , the highest weekly infection rates were in infants ( < 1 year - olds ) and declined with increas - ing age ( Fig . 3a and b ) .

The error bars indicate 95 % Confidence Intervals Page 7 of 10 Aiano et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1845 Discussion In England , 1 % of nurseries reported a COVID - 19 out - break to PHE over a three - month period encompassing a rapid spread of the Alpha variant , which is associated with increased transmissibility [ 26 ] , more severe disease and higher case fatality [ 27 ] . Children attending nurs - eries reporting an outbreak had a very low cumulative incidence compared to staff , irrespective of whether the index case was a child or staff . Consistent with commu - nity trends in < 5 year - olds , cumulative incidence was highest in infants and then declined with age . In con - trast , infection rates were up to tenfold higher in staff , especially when the index case was another staff member . Nationally , although the Alpha variant was first identi - fied in September 2020 , the rapid spread due to this vari - ant during December 2021 was responsible for a third national lockdown in England , which included restricted primary and secondary school attendance for children of keyworkers and vulnerable children in January 2021 [ 28 ] . Nationally , cases in < 5 year - olds remained low through - out the period and followed trends in older age - groups , increasing during December 2020 and then declining during January and February 2021 . While the number of nursery outbreaks were similar in November 2020 and January 2021 , we found some evidence of larger out - break sizes and higher cumulative incidence in January Fig . 3 Weekly laboratory‑confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection rates per 100 , 000 in England ( a ) by age‑group and ( b ) by age in years for children under 5 years of age Page 8 of 10 Aiano et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1845 2021 , when the Alpha variant predominated . Outbreaks reported in nurseries declined from mid - February to the end of April 2021 . Between 31 August and 18 October 2020 , when all education settings were fully open in England , only 0 . 3 % ( 87 / 32 , 852 ) nurseries reported a COVID - 19 outbreak compared to 2 % ( 450 / 18 , 943 ) primary schools and 10 % ( 519 / 5 , 409 ) secondary schools . This compares with 1 % ( 324 / 32 , 852 ) , 4 % ( 684 / 18 , 943 ) and 12 % ( 646 / 5 , 409 ) , respectively , between 02 November 2020 and 31 Janu - ary 2021 , which included a period when primary and secondary schools had restricted attendance for children of keyworkers and vulnerable children in January 2021 . When outbreaks did occur in nurseries , however , cumu - lative incidence in staff ( 24 . 26 % ) and children ( 2 . 34 % ) during November 2020 , when there was little circula - tion of the Alpha variant , was significantly higher than primary school teaching staff ( 9 . 81 % ) , secondary school teaching staff ( 3 . 97 % ) , secondary school students ( 1 . 20 % ) or primary school students ( 0 . 84 % ) during September and October 2020 , although these estimates were gen - erated during a period of different community preva - lence ( Fig . 3a ) [ 22 ] . Others have also reported extensive transmission in individual nursery outbreaks , with high SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates and seeding of infection into households [ 29 ] . Although children are more likely than adults to be asymptomatic , serosurveys where antibody testing is used to capture both symptomatic and asymp - tomatic infections , have reported similar or lower sero - positivity in children compared to staff members [ 30 , 31 ] , adding to the growing evidence that children – especially infants and toddlers – are not the main drivers of infec - tion in the household , educational settings or the wider community [ 32 ] . In France , only 3 . 7 % of 327 children and 6 . 8 % of 197 staff in 22 day centres were seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in June 2020 , compared to 5 . 0 % in non - clinical hospital staff controls [ 30 ] . Additionally , almost half the seropositive children ( 45 % ) had been in contact with an adult household member with confirmed COVID - 19 [ 30 ] , similar to our seroprevalence study in primary schools where most children were infected at home [ 31 ] . Among children attending nurseries reporting a COVID - 19 outbreak , the highest incidence was in infants and then declined with age , which was also observed in the national surveillance data [ 3 ] . A likely explanation is that it is not possible to maintain social distancing or strict infection control between the younger infants and staff or parents because they require frequent and pro - longed close contact for feeding and self - care . This was also frequently reported by nurseries participating in our investigations , along with difficulties in maintaining physical distancing between staff both within and across bubbles , which was compounded by sharing of staff rooms and bathrooms by staff across different bubbles in many nurseries . These factors likely contributed to the high cumulative incidence among staff , especially when the index case was also a staff member . Limitations Not all outbreaks would have been reported to PHE , as smaller , less complex outbreaks would have been man - aged by the settings themselves , with support from the National Schools Advice line and other partners such as Local Authorities . Additionally , HPTs in some regions with high COVID - 19 incidence only recorded larger outbreaks with at least 5 cases , complex outbreaks or those requiring public health action . We also relied on the settings to report cases among staff and children and , since the outbreaks were not investigated with mass testing for SARS - Cov - 2 infection , it is possible that the primary case may have been an asymptomatic child or adult who remained undetected . We are also unable to comment on the extent of asymptomatic spread in the affected settings for the same reason . In a recent Polish nursery outbreak , for example , wider RT - PCR testing of nursery staff , children and family members found that most of those infected with SARS - CoV - 2 were asymp - tomatic [ 29 ] . Another limitation is that the lack of viral genome sequencing data precludes assessment of trans - mission since it is not possible to determine whether the outbreaks were due to widespread transmission of a single strain or multiple introductions of different virus strains into nurseries [ 15 ] . A higher community SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate , for example , would result in more opportunities for virus introduction into nurseries and , therefore , higher estimates of cumulative incidence . Additionally , the lack of genome sequencing data meant that we were only able to assess the potential impact of Alpha indirectly by comparing outbreak size and cumu - lative incidence over time . We were unable to assess the nurseries who did not complete the survey . As such , this may have biased the results as those with time and capac - ity to complete the questionnaire may have had some systematic differences , such as staffing numbers , which could have affected the results . Finally , we were unable to objectively assess or compare adherence to physical dis - tancing and other infection control measures adopted by the nurseries . Implications and conclusions In England , COVID - 19 outbreaks were rare in nurseries and cumulative incidence was low in children but sub - stantially higher among staff members , higher than in primary or secondary schools [ 22 ] . In addition to the dif - ficulties in physical distancing from children frequenting Page 9 of 10 Aiano et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1845 nurseries , other potential contributors for transmis - sion among staff included shared use of staff rooms and bathrooms . This has important implications not only for SARS - CoV - 2 but also for other highly - transmissible viruses such as influenza and noroviruses , highlighting the importance of promoting and maintaining rigorous infection control practices at all times and a need for bet - ter physical structuring of nurseries as we aim to build back better from the current pandemic . Additionally , we have previously reported a strong correlation between community SARS - CoV - 2 infection rates and risk of outbreaks in educational settings [ 33 ] , highlighting the importance of maintaining low community infection rates to reduce the risk of introducing the virus into nurs - eries and other similar childcare and educational settings . Finally , every effort should be made to promote vaccina - tion – not only against COVID - 19 but also against other vaccine - preventable infections – among nursery staff . Further studies are needed to assess whether outbreaks in educational settings are due to multiple introductions or widespread transmission of a single strain , and the impact of novel variants in educational settings .
