RhoGDI α has been identi ﬁ ed as a risk of male sterility . In this study , we generate RhoGDI α knockout mice , and ﬁ nd that the males have severely low fertility . The testes from RhoGDI α − / − mice are smaller than that in WT mice . The numbers of spermatogonia and spermatocytes are decreased in RhoGDI α − / − testis . Spermatogenesis is compromised , and spermatocyte meiosis is arrested at zygotene stage in RhoGDI α − / − mice . Acrosome dysplasia is also observed in sperms of the mutant mice .

Actin - related cytoskeletal changes affect many aspects of cellular activity , including morphogen - esis , migration , phagocytosis , cytokinesis , and oocyte meiosis 2 – 4 . The regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis 5 , 6 . During mammalian spermatogenesis , three actin - rich structures , including ectoplasmic specialization ( ES ) , manchette , and acroplaxome , play essential roles in sperm dif - ferentiation and morphological changes 7 – 9 . ES is of two types : basal ES and apical ES . The basal ES is an indispensable com - ponent of the blood - testis barrier 10 . The apical ES , which is present in the Sertoli cell - developing spermatid interface , is important for shaping the sperm head , sperm cell movement , and sperm release into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules 11 . Manchette consists of perinuclear ring , microtubules , and actin ﬁ laments 12 , 13 . F - actin - and microtubule - based transport pro - vides some structural and functional support for nuclear shap - ing and ﬂ agellum formation 14 , 15 , and is vital in shaping the sperm head and sperm ﬂ agellum formation 16 , 17 . Acroplaxome comprising keratin 5 and F - actin anchors the developing acro - some to the elongating sperm nuclear envelope 13 , 18 and coop - erates with the manchette in the shaping of the spermatid head 19 , 20 . Ras homolog ( Rho ) - speci ﬁ c guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( RhoGDIs ) are important regulators of the Rho family of small GTPases that control a wide range of cellular processes , including cell adhesion , migration , proliferation , and various diseases such as pancreatic , breast , bladder cancer and chronic nephrosis . RhoGDIs mainly binds to inactive Rho GTPases , prevents nucleotide exchange , and then acts as an inhibitory regulator of Rho GTPases . RhoGDI α is the most richly expressed and characteristic member of the family . The related research of RhoGDI α mainly focus on several Rho GTPases , such as the small GTPase Ras homolog gene family member A ( RhoA ) , the small GTPase Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , Rac2 , and cell division control protein 42 ( Cdc42 ) 21 . RhoA activated Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) , which can phosphorylate and activate LIM kinase ( LIMK ) , while the activated LIMK phosphorylates and inhibits the activity of co ﬁ lin 22 . Rac1 binds to and activates p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) , which in turn phosphorylate and activate LIMK 23 . Further , LIMK regulates F - actin through cofolin 24 . Rac1 also plays a key role in regulating F - actin polymerization in cytoskeletal rearrangements 25 . Acti - vated Rac1 can also bind to IRSp53 , and IRSp53 binds to WAVE to form a trimolecular complex that stimulates the polymeriza - tion of new F - actin branches mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 26 . Cdc42 plays a role in regulating F - actin through its downstream Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) 27 . WASP and N - WASP link Cdc42 to the Arp2 / 3 complex to promote F - actin polymerization 28 . Also , Cdc42 can bind to and activate PAKs 29 . The dysregulation of Rho GTPases has been implicated in many human diseases 30 . However , the mechanism of Rho GTPases in regulating spermatogenesis remains to be elucidated . In this study , we successfully obtained RhoGDI α − / − mice using CRISPR / Cas9 gene - editing technology and found that male RhoGDI α - − / − mice were highly sub - fertile . Furthermore , we explored the molecular mechanisms , provided an evidence for the important role of Rac1 in male fertility . In summary , we sug - gested that RhoGDI α played an important role in maintaining testicular function and normal spermatogenesis through the Rac1 / LIMK / co ﬁ lin signaling pathway , and providing a theoretical basis for developing drugs for male infertility . Results De ﬁ ciency of RhoGDI α caused male sub - fertility in mice . CRISPR / Cas9 gene - editing technology was used to delete RhoGDI α in mice . One single - guide RNA ( sgRNA ) was designed to target the speci ﬁ c sequence in exon 2 of the RhoGDI α gene ( Fig . 1a ) . DNA sequencing results showed an insertion nearby the sgRNA target site ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The Western blot results showed that the RhoGDI α protein could no longer be detected in the RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 1b ) . We also examined the off - target effect of sgRNA . Four possible off - target genes were selected by sequence alignment : Cacna1d , Ripk4 , Stat6 , and Wdr60 . DNA fragments nearby the four potential off - target sites were ampli ﬁ ed and sequenced ; no mutations were found in all the four potential off - target genes ( Supplementary Fig . 1b - e ) . We tested other isoforms of RhoGDI , including RhoGDI β and RhoGDI γ , and found that their transcript levels in the testis of RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − mice were similar ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 1f ) . These results indicated that RhoGDI α − / − mice were successfully obtained by CRISPR / Cas9 gene - editing technology . We found that self - bred offspring of heterozygous mutant mice conformed to Mendelian heredity law . The RhoGDI α − / − male mice showed no abnormity in their daily behavior , but their body weight was smaller than that of the wild - type ( WT ) mice after 2 , 4 , and 6 months ( Fig . 1c ) . Meanwhile , the size ( Fig . 1d ) and weight ( Fig . 1e ) of testes from adult RhoGDI α − / − mice were signi ﬁ cantly reduced as those of the WT mice . The reproductive ability of male RhoGDI α − / − mice was signi ﬁ cantly weakened . Only one RhoGDI α − / − male mouse had offspring during the three months of co - caging with WT females , and the numbers of pups in two litters were 1 and 2 respectively ( Fig . 1f ) . The reproductive ability of female RhoGDI α − / − mice was also reduced . Only three litters ( a total of ﬁ ve pups ) were produced from two different RhoGDI α − / − female mice ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining results showed that the vacuolization appeared in the testes of 2 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice compared with RhoGDI α + / + mice ( Fig . 1g ) . The morphology of epithelial cells in the caput and cauda epididymis of RhoGDI α − / − mice was normal , but many round sperms were observed in the cauda epididymis ( Fig . 1g ) . In the 4 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice , severe vacuoliza - tion observed in seminiferous tubules , and the cells were lost severely . Only spermatocytes and round spermatids were observed , with no elongated spermatids in the testes ( Fig . 1h ) . No normal sperms were found in the cauda epididymis , except round sperm cells and shed germ cells ( Fig . 1h ) . At the age of 6 months , RhoGDI α − / − mice had severe testicular degeneration ( Fig . 1i ) . Most germ cells were lost , the epididymal epithelial cell morphology was still normal , and only round sperm cells and exfoliated germ cells were observed in the cauda epididymis . Meanwhile , the diameters of seminiferous tubules of RhoGDI α − / − mice decreased compared with those of RhoGDI α + / + mice ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . More - over , we explored whether RhoGDI α de ﬁ ciency affected the development of testis . A large number of pachytene spermatocytes were observed in 14 - day - old WT mice , but pachytene spermato - cytes were observed widely until 21 days of age in RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 1j , k ) . At 45 days after birth , male mice are sexually mature . The sperms were closely arranged in the seminiferous tubule lumen in the WT mice , but few sperms were observed in the RhoGDI α − / − mice testes ( Fig . 1l ) . These results indicated that RhoGDI α knockout retarded testis development , resulted in progressive testes degeneration , and reduced fertility in male mice . Abnormal spermatogenesis occurred in RhoGDI α − / − male mice . The sperms from the cauda epididymis were subjected to H & E staining to observe the sperm morphology . At the age of 2 months , the number of abnormal sperms signi ﬁ cantly increased ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04579 - 7 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 214 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04579 - 7 | www . nature . com / commsbio in RhoGDI α − / − mice compared with the WT mice ( Fig . 2a , b ) , with abnormal head , coiled tail , and decapitated sperms , especially the proportion of sperms with abnormal head ( Fig . 2c ) . The number of spermatozoa released from RhoGDI α − / − cauda epididymis dra - matically reduced ( Fig . 2d ) . Moreover , as revealed by computer - assisted sperm analysis ( CASA ) , the number of sperms with pro - gressive motility decreased ; meanwhile , and the number of immo - bilized sperms increased signi ﬁ cantly in RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 2e ) . At the age of 3 months , only very few sperm have normal morphology in RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) is a marker of DNA duplication , and it is used to examine the proliferation of spermatogonia and spermatocyte 31 , 32 . The number of PCNA - positive cells were found no obvious difference between 2 - month - old RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , and decreased signi ﬁ cantly in RhoGDI α − / − mice after 3 months Fig . 1 Testis showed progressive damage in RhoGDI α − / − mice . a Schematic diagram of sgRNA targets for the RhoGDI α genome , and sgRNA target sites located in exon 2 . b Western blot analysis was used to test the RhoGDI α protein , which was not expressed in RhoGDI α − / − mice . c Body weight was checked in RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − male mice at 2 months ( 2 M ) , 4 months ( 4 M ) , and 6 months ( 6 M ) of age . n = 4 biologically independent animals . d Photograph of RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − mouse testes .

The differentiating spermatogonia were analyzed by c - KIT staining . Compared to the WT mice , the number of c - KIT - positive cells decreased in seminiferous tubules at the active stage of spermatogonia differentiation in the testis of 3 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Supplementary Fig . 2f , g ) . Although γ H2AX is primarily a marker for DNA double - strand breaks , it can also be used to detect meiosis in the seminiferous tubules since it is widely expressed in the spermatocytes at the early stage of meiosis I 33 . Compared with RhoGDI α + / + mice , the proportion of the seminiferous tubules that showed extensive staining of γ H2AX did not change at 2 - month RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 2f , h ) ; and no difference was found in the number of γ H2AX - positive cells in single tubules ( Fig . 2f , i ) . However , in 3 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice , the tubules with large amounts of γ H2AX decreased ( Fig . 2g , h ) , and the number of γ H2AX - positive cells in single tubules also signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( Fig . 2g , i ) . These results indicated that the deletion of RhoGDI α caused loss of spermatogonia and spermatocyte . To determine the effects of RhoGDI α knockout on meiosis , we prepared chromosome spreads of spermatocytes isolated from the testis of 3 - month - old mice , and performed immunostaining for SCP3 and γ H2AX . ( Fig . 2j ) . The percentage of pachytene spermatocytes was reduced from 62 . 64 % in the RhoGDI α + / + mice to 29 . 90 % in the RhoGDI α − / − mice , and the percentage of spermatocytes in the diplotene stage was also decreased . On the other hand , spermatocytes of RhoGDI α − / − mice accumulated in the zygotene stage ( RhoGDI α + / + mice : 14 . 73 % ; RhoGDI α − / − mice : 49 . 74 % ) ( Fig . 2k ) . These results demonstrated that meiosis was arrested at the zygotene stage in the spermatocytes of RhoGDI α − / − mice .

Sperm head malformation is closely related to acrosome devel - opment . We found the abnormal head sperms increased in RhoGDI α − / − mice , then the acrosome development was assessed using FITC - labeled Arachis hypogaea ( peanut ) agglutinin ( PNA ) in the testis . In the seminiferous tubules of RhoGDI α + / + mice , typical cap - shaped ( stages IV - V ) or crescent moon - shaped ( stages VII – VIII ) acrosomes were observed in round spermatozoa ( Fig . 3a , b , g , h ) ; the acrosomes were located at the top of the nuclei in the elongated spermatids ( stages X – XI ) ( Fig . 3c , i ) . Besides , the sperms in the caudal epididymis showed that acro - somes were located at the top of sperm head and adhered to nuclei closely , showing a smooth crescent moon shape in RhoGDI α + / + mice ( Fig . 3m ) . In 2 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice , the spermatids with crescent - shaped acrosome were reduced ( Fig . 3d – f ) , and the proportion of malformed acrosomes in the caudal epididymis increased , including fragmentation , diffusion , and missing acrosomes ( Fig . 3m , n ) . In transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images , the acrosome of caudal epididymis sperms showed a full and regular shape in WT mice , as indicated by the black arrow ( Fig . 3o ) . Sperms from RhoGDI α − / − mice showed various defects in acrosomes , such as deformation and fragmentation as shown in red box ( Fig . 3o ) . The scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images showed that , the RhoGDI α - de ﬁ cient sperms exhibited malformed head morphologies , deviating from the ﬂ at , crescent - shaped structures . Speci ﬁ c defects included the disorganized anterior acrosome and the noticeable absence of equatorial segment , post - acrosomal sheath , sharp hook rim , and ventral spur ( Fig . 3p ) . The sperms with acrosome dysplasia have a higher probability of spontaneous acrosome reaction ( AR ) before reaching the vicinity of the eggs , which prevents successful fertilization 34 , 35 . In RhoGDI α − / − mice , the frequency of spontaneous AR increased signi ﬁ cantly in the non - capacitated as well as capacitated sperm compared with those in the RhoGDI α + / + mice ( Fig . 3q , r ) . These results indicated that the morphology and function of acrosomes were abnormal in 2 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice . The acrosomes with cap - shaped ( stages IV - V ) and crescent - shaped ( stages VII – VIII ) ( Fig . 3j , k ) could be observed in the testes of 3 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice , but the number of round spermatozoa severely reduced . When the seminiferous epithelium developed to stages X – XI , only a few spermatozoa were elongated ( Fig . 3l ) , indicating that spermatogenesis was severely hindered at this stage . RhoGDI α regulated the LIMK / co ﬁ lin signaling pathway in testis and GC - 1spg cells . Rho family GTPase levels drastically reduced , but the levels of active Rho proteins ( Rac1 , Cdc42 and RhoA ) increased after RhoGDI α depletion 36 . In this study , Rho GTPase levels also reduced after RhoGDI α de ﬁ ciency in knockout Fig . 3 RhoGDI α is essential for acrosome morphology and function development . a - l FITC - labeled PNA was used to examine acrosomes at different developmental stages in RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − mice at 2 months and 3 months of age .

And the active Rho proteins including Rac1 and RhoA were increased in RhoGDI α − / − testis ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) . We observed the expression of LIMK and P - LIMK in the RhoGDI α knockout mouse testes . No difference in the total LIMK level was found , while P - LIMK expression was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in RhoGDI α − / − testis ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Phosphorylation - activated LIMK phosphorylated co ﬁ lin at Ser3 , resulting in a signi ﬁ cant increase in the phosphorylation level of co ﬁ lin in the testes of RhoGDI α − / − mice , while the total co ﬁ lin level did not change ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Moreover , immunohistochemical staining intuitively showed that P - co ﬁ lin expression increased in RhoGDI α − / − mouse testes ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Meanwhile , the pathway was also detected in GC - 1spg cells . We designed three SiRNAs to knock down RhoGDI α . The RhoGDI α level was decreased remarkably at both mRNA and protein levels by Si - RhoGDI α - 3 ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . Therefore , Si - RhoGDI α - 3 was used for follow - up experiments . The expression levels of LIMK and co ﬁ lin did not show any differences ( Fig . 4e – h ) , but the phosphorylation levels of LIMK and co ﬁ lin signi ﬁ cantly increased after Si - RhoGDI α transfection into GC - 1spg cells compared with those in the negative control ( NC ) groups ( Fig . 4e – h ) . As the RhoGDI α − / − mouse testis damaged progressively , the expression of RhoGDI α was observed in the WT mouse testes at different ages . Western blot results showed that RhoGDI α was expressed invariably in mice of different ages ( Fig . 4i , j ) . Next , the co ﬁ lin and P - co ﬁ lin expression were tested . At the age of 1 month , the expression of co ﬁ lin was at a low level ( Fig . 4k , l ) ; it mainly existed in its inactive form P - co ﬁ lin ( Fig . 4k , m ) . However , the expression of co ﬁ lin signi ﬁ cantly increased and remained at a similar level at the age of 2 – 10 months ( Fig . 4k , l ) , while the level of P - co ﬁ lin signi ﬁ cantly decreased after 2 months ( equivalent to about 16 years in humans 37 ) and remained at a low level until the age of 10 months ( Fig . 4k , m ) . RhoGDI α de ﬁ ciency resulted in F - actin polymerization and apoptosis in testis and GC - 1spg cells . Co ﬁ lin is required to control the F - actin depolymerization and assembly , which indi - cated that RhoGDI α deletion might adversely affect the depoly - merization of F - actin . Phalloidin staining was used to observe F - actin to verify our hypothesis . In GC - 1spg cells , F - actin exhibited abnormal aggregation in the Si - RhoGDI α groups compared with the NC group ( Fig . 5a ) . Meanwhile , F - actin aggregated around germ cells abnormally in RhoGDI α − / − mouse testes ( Fig . 5b ) . We also isolated Sertoli cells to test F - actin levels , and detected aberrant expression of F - actin in the SOX9 - positive Sertoli cells from RhoGDI α − / − mice ( as indicated by the red arrow ) ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . These results indicating that the depolymerization of F - actin was inhibited after the deletion of RhoGDI α . Beside this , the 3 ‐ ( 4 , 5 ‐ dimethylthiazol ‐ 2 ‐ yl ) ‐ 2 , 5 ‐ diphenylte - trazolium bromide ( MTT ) experiment showed that the GC - 1spg cell viability decreased after RhoGDI α was knocked down ( Fig . 5c ) . P53 expression was tested to examine whether cell apoptosis occurred in GC - 1spg cells . Immuno ﬂ uorescence detection showed that Si - RhoGDI α increased p53 expression and promoted its nuclear accumulation ( Fig . 5a ) . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ‐ mediated dUTP ‐ biotin nick - end labeling ( TUNEL ) assay was performed to observe the apoptosis . The proportion of TUNEL - positive GC - 1spg cells increased after Fig . 4 LIMK / co ﬁ lin signaling pathway was activated after knockout or knockdown of RhoGDI α . a – d The levels of P - LIMK , LIMK , P - co ﬁ lin , and co ﬁ lin were compared between RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − in mouse testes . n = 6 biologically independent animals . e , f GC - 1spg cells were treated with Si - RhoGDI α for 48 h , and the protein was extracted to detect LIMK and its phosphorylation level . g , h Levels of P - co ﬁ lin and co ﬁ lin in GC - 1spg cells were also tested after Si - RhoGDI α treatment . f , h n = 6 batches of cells in each group . i , j Protein level of RhoGDI α was detected by Western blot in WT mice at 1 month ( 1 M ) , 2 months ( 2 M ) , 3 months ( 3 M ) , 6 months ( 6 M ) , and 10 months ( 10 M ) of age . n = 5 biologically independent animals . k – m Protein expression and phosphorylation of co ﬁ lin in WT mice of different ages . n = 4 biologically independent animals . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 vs RhoGDI α + / + or NC groups .

In testis , the results showed that both the proportion of TUNEL - positive seminiferous tubules ( Fig . 6a , b ) and the number of apoptotic cells in these apoptosis tubules ( Fig . 6a , c ) increased in 2 - month - old RhoGDI α − / − mice . In 4 months , apoptosis was more severe in RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 6d ) . The percentage of apoptotic seminiferous tubules increased to 91 % compared with 29 % at 2 months ( Fig . 6b , e ) , and the percentage of apoptotic cells in each seminiferous tubule increased to 38 % ( Fig . 6f ) . SOX9 - marked Sertoli cells were counted , and the result showed that no difference was found in the Sertoli cell count of RhoGDI α − / − mice after 2 months , 4 months , and 6 months compared with RhoGDI α + / + mice ( Fig . 6g , h ) . This result indicated that RhoGDI α deletion did not cause the loss of Sertoli cells . Rac1 or ROCK inhibitor alleviated GC - 1spg cell injury induced by Si - RhoGDI α . NSC23766 ( a unique Rac - speci ﬁ c inhibitor ) was used to inhibit the activity of Rac1 in GC - 1spg cells so as to suggest that RhoGDI α regulated the polymerization and depo - lymerization of F - actin via the Rac1 / LIMK / co ﬁ lin signaling pathway . NSC23766 could effectively improve cell viability , and the 10 µM NSC23766 dose showed better effects , which was selected for further experiments ( Fig . 7a ) . The data of this study showed that NSC23766 repressed the elevated levels of the P - LIMK and P - co ﬁ lin induced by Si - RhoGDI α ( Fig . 7b – e ) and reduced the abnormal aggregation of F - actin after Si - RhoGDI α treatment ( Fig . 7f , g ) . After RhoGDI α was knocked down , the aggregation of F - actin was most obvious in cells with high expression of P - co ﬁ lin ( Fig . 7f ) . This further suggested that the abnormal accumulation of F - actin was mostly in ﬂ uenced by increased P - co ﬁ lin under RhoGDI α knockdown . Moreover , NSC23766 alleviated the nuclear translocation of P53 under Si - RhoGDI α , as shown by P53 immuno ﬂ uorescence results , the number and brightness of P53 positive nuclei decreased ( Fig . 7g ) , and the number of TUNEL - positive cells reduced markedly by the inhibition of Rac1 after RhoGDI α knockdown ( Fig . 7h , i ) . These results indicated that NSC23766 alleviated GC - 1spg cell injury caused by RhoGDI α de ﬁ ciency though LIMK / co ﬁ lin pathway . Besides Rac1 , the Rho family GTPase RhoA and its down - stream effector ROCK also controlled many different cellular processes 38 , 39 . In GC - 1spg cells , Y - 27632 ( ROCK inhibitor ) improved cell viability after RhoGDI α knockdown ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 7a ) . The phosphorylation levels of LIMK and co ﬁ lin were also reduced by Y - 27632 after the transfection of Si - RhoGDI α ( Supplementary Fig . 7b , c ) . Besides , the inhibitor of ROCK repressed the extensive F - actin polymerization ( Supplementary Fig . 7d ) and cell apoptosis ( Supplementary Fig . 7e , f ) induced by the knockdown of RhoGDI α . Rac1 inhibitor improved sperm quality in RhoGDI α − / − mice . Then whether NSC23766 could improve the sperm quality and degeneration of spermatogenic epithelium in RhoGDI α − / − mice was examined . NSC23766 or normal saline ( NS ) was injected into a micro - sustained - release pump , and the pump was administered to RhoGDI α − / − mice at the age of 8 weeks . After 4 weeks of Fig . 5 F - actin polymerization and apoptosis occurred after RhoGDI α deletion . a Staining of F - actin and P53 was achieved using the natural compounds phalloidin and secondary antibody conjugated with different ﬂ uorophores , respectively .

However , NSC23766 ameliorated the reduction in testis volume and weight caused by RhoGDI α knockout ( Fig . 8b , c ) . The administration of NSC23766 reduced the histological damage in testis , concomitantly with improving sperm morphology and concentration in the cauda epididymis ( Fig . 8d ) . Sperms released from the caudal epididymis were collected and stained with H & E to reveal their morphology clearly ( Fig . 8e ) . Statistics showed that the proportion of normal morphology sperms was increased after NSC23766 treatment ( Fig . 8f ) . The reduced sperm concentration in RhoGDI α − / − mice was substantially ameliorated by NSC23766 treatment ( Fig . 8g ) . CASA analysis also showed that progressive motility of sperms improved , and the number of immobilized sperms decreased by NSC23766 in RhoGDI α − / − mice compared with RhoGDI α − / − mice after treatment with NS ( Fig . 8h ) . These results indicated that NSC23766 improved sperm quality in RhoGDI α − / − mice . NSC23766 reduced testicular injury by inhibiting LIMK / co ﬁ lin pathway in RhoGDI α − / − mice . This study investigated whether NSC23766 functioned through the LIMK / co ﬁ lin signaling to improve sperm quality in RhoGDI α − / − mice . Western blot results showed that the phosphorylation level of LIMK increased after RhoGDI α deletion , which was inhibited by NSC23766 administration ( Fig . 9a ) . Subsequently , the phosphorylation of co ﬁ lin was inhibited by NSC23766 in RhoGDI α − / − testes ( Fig . 9b ) . In the testis , the numbers of both round spermatozoa and elongating spermatids with normal acrosomes were increased under NSC23766 treatment ( Fig . 9c ) . The sperms in the caudal epididymis also exhibited acrosomes with normal shape after NSC23766 treatment in RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 9d ) . Besides , NSC23766 increased the numbers of both the γ H2AX - positive seminiferous tubules ( Fig . 9f and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) and γ H2AX - positive cells of single tubules ( Fig . 9e , g ) in RhoGDI α − / − male mice . The immuno ﬂ uorescence results of PCNA showed that the proliferating germ cells signi ﬁ cantly increased after NSC23766 treatment in RhoGDI α − / − mice ( Fig . 9h ) . Also , NSC23766 protected testicular cells from apoptosis injury , which was evident by the decreased expression level of P53 protein ( Fig . 9i ) and reduced number of TUNEL - positive cells ( Fig . 9j – l ) in RhoGDI α − / − + NSC23766 groups . In a word , the aforemen - tioned results showed that the Rac1 inhibitor alleviated the testis injury in RhoGDI α − / − mice . Discussion RhoGDI α was identi ﬁ ed as a down - regulated regulator of Rho family GTPase . It is involved in various biological processes , although its role in spermatogenesis is not completely clear . To this end , we generated RhoGDI α − / − mice , which are highly sub - Fig . 6 Apoptosis was detected in the testes of RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − mice . a Testicular apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay at the age of 2 months .

We explored the mechanisms underlying male infertility in these mice , and identi ﬁ ed molecular targets that may be utilized in alleviating testis injury . The RhoGDI family of proteins control Rho GTPases by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP ( inactive form ) , promoting the interaction of the active Rho GTPases with their effector proteins , targeting the Rho GTPases to the subcellular compartment , and preventing hydrolysis of the bound GTP 40 . In RhoGDI family , RhoGDI α is widely expressed in many tissues 41 , 42 , and plays an important role in cell division , morphology and migration . It primarily exerts its effects through Rho GTPases - mediated depolymerization and polymerization of F - actin 43 . The optimal level of RhoGDI α is necessary for maintaining normal tissue morphogenesis and development . For instance , overexpression of RhoGDI α in a transgenic mouse model inhibited cardiomyocyte proliferation , and disrupted cardiac morphogenesis 44 . On the other hand , RhoGDI α − / − mice have been shown to develop progressive renal disease and die due to kidney failure within a year 45 . In our study , the RhoGDI α − / − mice weighed less and had smaller kidney and testis compared to their wild - type counter - parts , which is consistent with previous reports 45 , 46 . These results indicated that RhoGDI α plays an essential role in organ growth and development . We focused on the function of RhoGDI α in spermatogenesis . We found that the numbers of spermatogonia and spermatocytes were signi ﬁ cantly decreased , and the devel - opment of seminiferous tubule was delayed in the RhoGDI α − / − mice . In addition , the testicular defects in these became more severe with aging , which can be attributed to the age - dependent depletion of spermatogonia . Abnormal spermatogenesis and acrosome dysplasia were also observed in the testis of RhoGDI α − / − mice . The molecular mechanisms were further explored . A previous study showed that , in RhoGDI α − / − lung , RhoA activity is increased while that of Rac1 is unaffected 47 . Furthermore , there are reports that , in the renal , RhoGDI α de ﬁ ciency increased the level of active Rac1 but not that of RhoA 46 , 48 , 49 . Thus , the reg - ulatory effects of RhoGDI α are highly complex and involve multiple signaling pathways , as well as tissue - speci ﬁ c molecular Fig . 8 NSC23766 improved the sperm quality of RhoGDI α − / − mice . a Body weight of RhoGDI α + / + mice , RhoGDI α − / − mice , and RhoGDI α − / − mice with NSC23766 . b , c Picture and weight of mouse testes .

We found that the activity of Rac1 and RhoA were increased in the testis of RhoGDI α − / − mice , and the LIMK / co ﬁ lin pathway was also activated . The increased level of P - co ﬁ lin disrupted the depolymerization of F - actin in the testis of RhoGDI α − / − mice . The dynamic reg - ulation of F - actin polymerization and disassembly controls cell division and morphology 50 . F - actin disorders are associated with a reduced number of germ cells , meiosis arrest at the zygotene stage , and acrosome dysplasia . In addition , the F - actin in Sertoli cells also plays an important role in spermatogenesis and male infertility 51 . We detected aberrant F - actin depolymerization in the Sertoli cells isolated from RhoGDI α − / − mice , which was indicative of a dysfunctional status . Furthermore , we also observed some round spermatozoa shedding in the cauda epidi - dymis of the RhoGDI α − / − mice , which may be related to the dysfunction of Sertoli cells 51 , 52 . Therefore , RhoGDI α deletion phenotypes may be caused by both the defects in germ cells as well as F - actin disorders in Sertoli cells . However , the speci ﬁ c function of RhoGDI α in germ cells and Sertoli cells remains unclear . To clarify this point , we will construct Floxed mice and crossbreed them with AMH - Cre ( Sertoli cell - speci ﬁ c expression ) or Stra8 - Cre ( spermatogonia - speci ﬁ c expression ) mice , in order to explore the speci ﬁ c defects in Sertoli cells and germ cells caused by RhoGDI α deletion . We used GC - 1spg cells to identify potential molecular targets for reversing the testicular damage caused by RhoGDI α depletion .

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04579 - 7 ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2023 ) 6 : 214 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 023 - 04579 - 7 | www . nature . com / commsbio 11 Several studies have used this cellular model to elucidate the function of spermatogonia 53 – 55 . We tested the effects of Rac1 inhibitor ( NSC23766 ) and Rock1 inhibitor ( Y - 27632 ) in GC - 1spg cells transfected with Si - RhoGDI α . Based on the stable effects of NSC23766 on GC - 1spg cells , we treated 8 - week - old RhoGDI α − / − male mice with different concentrations ( 2 . 5 , 5 , 8 and 10 mg / kg / d ) of the drug . We found that the concentrations of 5 – 8 mg / kg / d alleviated testis injury and improved sperm quality in RhoGDI α − / − mice . Although a recent report showed that GC - 1spg cells are more likely to be the derivatives of Leydig cells ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 01 . 07 . 425754 ) , this does not affect our conclusions since they are mainly derived from testis and sperm . Further - more , the GC - 1spg cells merely reinforce the results of in vivo experiments , which suggests that regulating Rho GTPases activity may be a potential therapy for the male sterility . The male RhoGDI α − / − mice showed impaired testis and massive proteinuria , and died due to renal failure within a year 45 . This is consistent with the report that mutations in the human homolog of RhoGDI α ( ARHGDIA ) can cause nephrotic syndrome 49 . It is unclear that whether RhoGDI α mutations manifest as abnormal reproductive phenotypes , and it is worth testing reproductive function in mice harboring these mutations . ARHGDIA mutations result in the failure to regulate the migra - tion of human podocytes , and are related to the activation of Rac1 and the regulation of actin 49 , 56 , 57 . This is in line with our ﬁ ndings in the testis of RhoGDI α − / − mice . It will be worth analyzing whether men with fertility issues harbor mutations in ARHGDIA . In summary , this is the ﬁ rst study reporting the function of RhoGDI α in spermatogenesis and fertility . We found that genetic ablation of RhoGDI α activated the LIMK / co ﬁ lin signaling path - way , inhibited F - actin depolymerization and induced germ cell apoptosis . The loss of germ cells in the testis of RhoGDI α − / − mice led to extensive vacuolation . During sperm head shaping , the abnormal F - actin dynamic also caused acrosome dysplasia , which resulted in malformed sperm head and acrosome . Furthermore , a Rac1 inhibitor alleviated the testicular defects in RhoGDI α − / − mice through the Rac1 / co ﬁ lin / F - actin pathway , indicating a possible molecular target for treating infertility in men . Methods Ethical statement . The health C57BL / 6 mice ( ≤ 6 months old ) were kept under standard conditions for animals ( Temperature , 21 ±1 °C ; Humidity , 50 – 60 % ) and a light / dark cycle of 12 / 12h . All animal experiments are conducted in accordance with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Shandong University ( Jinan , China ) , and animal management is strictly in accordance with the Animal Ethics Standards of Shandong University . Animals . RhoGDI α − / − mice were generated using the CRISPR / Cas9 technology . The sgRNA target sequence was as follows : 5 ′ - AGACAGCTACTCGGCCCA GC − 3 ′ . The hCas9 mRNA and sgRNAs were produced by in vitro transcription using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit ( Am1345 ; AmbionInc , Austin , TX , USA ) . WT C57BL / 6 superovulated females were mated with WT males to obtain zygotes for Cas9 mRNA ( 50 ng / ml ) and sgRNA ( 25 ng / ml ) injection . In the new - born founders , the genomic DNA surrounding the sgRNA target sites was ampli ﬁ ed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( Forward primers : 5 ′ - GCTGT CACAGTCCTGCTCAT - 3 ′ ; and Reverse primers , 5 ′ - GCACTTCCCCTCTTC TCCAC - 3 ′ ) , and the PCR products were sequenced to identify the mutations . NSC23766 ( Aladdin , China ) was subcutaneously infused via an osmotic minipump ( Alza , USA ) into RhoGDI α − / − male mice at 8 weeks of age for 4 weeks . Our study revealed that NSC23766 at a dose of 5 – 8 mgkg − 1 d − 1 ameliorated testicular injury . Fertility test . For assessing the reproductive ability , 2 - month - old RhoGDI α + / + or RhoGDI α − / − male mice were caged with 2 - month - old WT female mice in a ratio of 1 : 2 and allowed to mate naturally for 3 months . Three male mice were tested . And WT or RhoGDI α − / − female mice were caged with WT male mice at a ratio of 2 : 1 for 3 months to test the reproductive ability of RhoGDI α − / − female mice . Six female mice were used in each group . The number of pups per litter was observed and recorded . Three mating cages were set for each genotype . Computer - assisted sperm analysis . The sperm from the caudal epididymis was analyzed . The cauda epididymis of adult mice was removed and washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and then placed in an M2 medium ( Sigma Aldrich , USA ) . The incisions were made into the caudal epididymis and placed at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 for 30 min to make sperm swim out from the caudal epidi - dymis incision . The tissue fragments were removed and supplemented with M2 medium to 500 μ L . Then , 10 μ L of the ﬂ uid was placed on the counting slide to assess sperm motility using a computer - assisted sperm analysis system ( Tsinghua Tongfang Co . , LTD . , China ) . More than 200 sperms were counted for each test . Three counting slides were tested and averaged in each mouse . Histological analysis . The testis and epididymis of RhoGDI α + / + or RhoGDI α − / − mice were ﬁ xed in Bouin ’ s solution overnight at 4 °C . After a series of gradient dehydration and embedding in paraf ﬁ n , the tissues were cut into sections of 4 μ m thickness . According to standard procedures , the tissue sections were stained with H & E . Finally , the stained sections were transparent in xylene and sealed with neutral gum . The histological structure was observed under an optical microscope ( Nikon YS100 , Japan ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining . The testes were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) overnight at 4°C . They were next dehydrated and embedded in paraf ﬁ n or Tissue - Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature ( OCT ) Compound ( SAKURA , USA ) . The paraf ﬁ n sections were dewaxed and rehydrated , and the frozen sections were washed with PBS . Subsequently , antigen repair was performed with 0 . 01 % sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 , Solarbio , China ) in paraf ﬁ n or frozen sections . The sections were permeated with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 and blocked with 10 % goat serum for 30 min at 37 °C . Besides , GC - 1spg cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA at room tem - perature for 30min , permeated with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked with 10 % goat serum . The sections or cells were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C after blocking with goat serum . The secondary antibodies con - jugated to ﬂ uorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC , 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen , USA ) or tetra - methylrhodamine isothiocyanate Fluor ( 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen , USA ) were used to test the primary antibody , and the nuclei were stained with DAPI . The image was captured using an LSM900 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . The antibodies used were as follows : γ H2AX ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam , UK ) , PCNA ( 1 : 100 ; Santa , USA ) , P53 ( 1 : 200 ; CST , USA ) , SOX9 ( 1 : 200 ; ABclonal , USA ) , SCP3 ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam , UK ) . Immunohistochemical staining . For immunohistochemical staining of the testis , the paraf ﬁ n sections were dewaxed and rehydrated , and 0 . 01 % sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 , Solarbio , China ) was used for antigen repair . The sections were permeated with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 10min and blocked with 10 % goat serum for 30 min at 37°C . After goat serum removal , the primary antibody was incubated at 4°C overnight . Then , SP - 9000 SPlink Detection Kits ( Biotin - Streptavidin HRP Detection Systems , ZSGB - BIO , China ) were used to test antibody binding . The antibodies used were as follows : P - co ﬁ lin ( 1 : 200 ; CST , USA ) and SOX9 ( 1 : 200 ; ABclonal , USA ) , c - KIT ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam , UK ) . F - actin detection . Phalloidin is a natural toxin puri ﬁ ed from the mushroom Amanita phalloides to label the F - actin of the cytoskeleton 58 . The mice testes were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and suspended in Tissue - Tek OCT Compound ( SAKURA , USA ) . The frozen section experiment was carried out . After washing frozen sections with PBS , phalloidin ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , USA ) was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C to show F - actin , and the nuclei were stained with DAPI . For GC - 1spg cells , the cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA for 20 min and washed with PBS after treatment with Si - RhoGDI α and NSC23766 or Y - 27632 . Then , phalloidin was also incubated for 40 min at 37 °C . The results were captured using the LSM900 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . TUNEL assay . Testis and GC - 1spg cell apoptosis was measured using TUNEL assay with an in situ cell death detection kit ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) following the manufacturer ’ s protocols . Paraf ﬁ n sections of testicular tissue were dewaxed and rehydrated , then incubated with 3 % H 2 O 2 in methanol solution for 10 min at room temperature , and then subjected to TUNEL staining . After ﬁ xing in 4 % PFA for 20min , the GC - 1spg cells were incubated with 3 % H 2 O 2 in methanol solution for 10min , TUNEL incubation was then performed . Western blot analysis . Western blot analysis was performed using standard methods . The antibodies used were as follows : RhoGDI α ( 1 : 1000 ; Abcam , USA ) , P - LIMK ( 1 : 1000 ; CST , USA ) , LIMK ( 1 : 1000 ; Proteintech , USA ) , P - co ﬁ lin ( 1 : 1000 ; CST , USA ) , co ﬁ lin ( 1 : 1000 ; Proteintech , USA ) , P53 ( 1 : 1000 ; CST , USA ) , Rac1 ( 1 : 1000 ; Proteintech , USA ) , Cdc42 ( 1 : 1000 ; Proteintech , USA ) , Pak4 ( 1 : 1000 ; Proteintech , USA ) , Rock1 ( 1 : 1000 ; Proteintech , USA ) , RhoA ( 1 : 1000 ; Af ﬁ nity , China ) and GAPDH ( 1 : 10000 ; Proteintech , USA ) . Rac1 and RhoA activity was detected by the Rac1 / RhoA Pull - Down Activation Assay Biochem Kit ( Cytoske - leton , USA ) . The Western blot bands were quanti ﬁ ed by ImageJ software and normalized to GAPDH .

GC - 1spg cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM , Hyclone Laboratories , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco , USA ) , 100 U / mL penicillin and streptomycin . SiRNAs of RhoGDI α ( Si - RhoGDI α , 100nmol / L ) were transfected when cells reached 80 % con ﬂ uence . The sequence of siRNA was as follows : Sense of Si ‐ RhoGDI α - 3 : 5 ′ ‐ UCCGGGUGAACAGAGAGAUTT ‐ 3 ′ , antisense 5 ′ ‐ AUCUCUCU GUUCACCCGGATT ‐ 3 ′ ; NC for Si ‐ RhoGDI α , sense 5 ′ ‐ UUCUCCGAACGUGUC ACGUTT ‐ 3 ′ , antisense 5 ′ ‐ ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT ‐ 3 ′ .

After treatment in different experimental groups , 20 μ L of MTT ( Sigma ‐ Aldrich , USA ) solution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 4 h . Then , the supernatant was discarded , and 150 μ L of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals . Finally , the optical density of each well was measured at 490nm . Sperm acrosome detection . The FITC conjugate PNA ( sigama , USA ) was used to assess acrosomes 59 . In brief , sperms were released from the cauda epididymis and capacitated for 30min . After washing the sperms with PBS , they were coated on slides and air - dried . The sperms were ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA . After washing with PBS , the sperm acrosomes were stained with PNA ( 15 ug / mL in PBS ) for 40 min at 37°C . For acrosomes of the testis , the testicular paraf ﬁ n sections were dewaxed and rehydrated , and then PNA was stained at 37 °C for 40min . DAPI was used to stain the nuclei . As for the spontaneous AR frequency test , the sperms from epididymis were incubated in a TYH medium ( Nanjing Aibei Biotechnology Co . , Nanjing , China ) that was balanced at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 overnight and capacitation for 50min . The spontaneous AR frequency was shown by the ratio of PNA - negative sperms to DAPI - positive sperms . More than 200 sperms were counted for each mouse . Transmission electronic microscopy . Sperm cells were released from the caudal epididymis for 30 min at 37 °C . After washing with PBS , sperm cells were cen - trifuged for 10min at 3000 rpm . Then the clump of sperm cells was immobilized with glutaraldehyde and osmium , infused in 10 % gelatin , dehydrated with sucrose , and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Frozen slicing ( 50 nm ) was performed using a cryo - ultramicrotome ( EM FC7 ; Leica , Germany ) and observed using a JEM - 1200EX microscope ( JEOL , Japan ) following the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Scanning electron microscopy . Sperm samples from the cauda epididymis of RhoGDI α + / + and RhoGDI α − / − mice were washed with PBS , spread onto slides and air dried . The samples were ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and post - ﬁ xed in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 2 h before dehydration in 25 % , 50 % , 75 % , 90 % , and 100 % gradient ethanol . Then , they were subjected to critical point drying in an Autosamdri - 815A ( Tousimis , USA ) . The samples were mounted with gold , and a JEOL 7000 ﬁ eld emission gun SEM ( QUANTA 250 FEG , FEI , USA ) was used to observe the morphology of sperms . Statistics and reproducibility . All the experimental data were presented as mean± SD , Student ’ s t - test was used for comparing data , and P < 0 . 05 was con - sidered statistically . The graphs were produced by GraphPad Prim software . At least three replicates were performed to ensure reproducibility . Sample sizes and the de ﬁ ned replicates are showed in the ﬁ gure legend .
