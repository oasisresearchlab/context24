Clathrin coated pits are the canonical endocytic carriers for CME and have been extensively studied . In contrast , the cellular role of ﬂat clathrin lattices , characterised by their stability , are not well understood . Here we show that ﬂat clathrin lattices mediate the formation of a special type of cellular adhesions , called reticular adhesions , in a process controlled by the composition of the extracellular matrix . We observed that cells plated on ﬁbronectin displayed few ﬂat clathrin lattices and reticular adhesions . Notably , this effect occurred locally in cells , in an extracellular matrix - contact dependent manner . Inhibition of the CME machinery led to complete disappearance of reticular adhesions and live - cell imaging showed that ﬂat clathrin lattice assembly is required for the establishment of reticular adhesions . Manipulation of the ﬁbronectin receptor integrin β 1 revealed that the formation of ﬂat clathrin lattices - and consequently reticular adhesions - are controlled by the activity of this receptor . CME and other endocytic routes have conventionally been linked to the disassembly of cellular adhesions by mediating the internalisation of their components . Our results present a novel paradigm in the relationship between these two processes by showing that endocytic proteins can also play a role in the assembly of cellular adhesions . Introduction Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis ( CME ) is the predominant route by which cells internalise nutrients , pathogens and membrane components ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . The distinguishing feature of CME is the formation of short - lived and dynamic membrane invaginations covered by polygonal clathrin cages termed clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . The CME machinery also assembles into large , long - lived structures known as “clathrin plaques” or ﬂat clathrin lattices ( FCLs ) ( Grove et al . , 2014 ) . Despite having a similar molecular composition to CCPs , our understanding of the biology of FCLs is very limited . FCLs are considered as stalled endocytic events and recent studies support the idea that FCLs are signalling platforms ( Alfonzo - Méndez et al . , 2022 ; Grove et al . , 2014 ; Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ) . In vivo , FCLs localise to adhesive structures between bone and osteoclasts ( Akisaka et al . , 2008 ) and are required for the organization of sarcomeres ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2014 ) . Notably , the cellular conditions and the cascade of events regulating the formation , maintenance and disassembly of FCLs are completely unknown . Recent studies showed that FCLs localised to reticular adhesions ( RAs ) , a long - lived and distinct cellular adhesion composed of integrin α v β 5 and devoid of typical focal adhesion ( FA ) components ( Lock et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . The cellular signiﬁcance of this colocalisation remains largely unexplored . Here , we show that the formation of RAs depends on FCLs . Moreover , we found that the composition of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is a master regulator of this process where ﬁbronectin - activated integrin β 1 acts as an inhibitor of the co - assembly of FCLs and RAs . 1 Results ECM composition determines the ratio between CCPs and FCLs While studying CME dynamics , we serendipitously observed that cells on ﬁbronectin ( FN ) appears to display fewer FCLs . To conﬁrm this ﬁnding , we measured the frequency of FCLs in U2OS cells with an endogenously GFP - tagged alpha adaptin 2 sigma subunit ( AP2S1 , hereafter referred to simply as AP2 ) plated on glass and FN ( Fig . 1a , b ) . AP2 is a widely used CME marker ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2008 ) . We opted to use an endogenously tagged cell line throughout this study as the expression level of this complex was reported to modulate FCL frequencies ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . Cells plated on glass presented many typical FCLs ( i . e . bright , long - lived AP2 - GFP marked endocytic structures ) while cells on FN displayed predominantly typical CCPs ( Fig . 1a - b ) . To further explore this observation , we compared FCL frequencies in cells plated on dishes coated with major ECM proteins FN , vitronectin ( VTN ) , collagen I ( Col I ) and collagen IV ( Col IV ) . As controls , we also plated cells on two non - ECM coatings , bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) , or glass . This comparative analysis revealed that FN stands out from other matrix proteins and reduces FCL frequency most prominently ( Fig . 1c , Fig . S1a , Supplementary video 1 ) . Col IV and VTN reduced FCL frequency to some extent compared to glass and the non - ECM coatings ( Fig . 1a , Fig . S1a , Supplementary video 1 ) . The non - ECM proteins ( BSA and PLL ) had no FCL reducing effect . Interestingly , and in line with a recent study ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ) , Col I did not reduce FCLs ( Fig . 1b , Fig . S1a , Supplementary video 1 ) . For many cell lines , it is common to ﬁnd considerable variability in the presence of FCLs in culture . We thus decided to probe if this variability is due to differential FN production within the culture . Conﬁrming this hypothesis , and providing an explanation for the variability of FCL proﬁles within cultures , we found that cells plated on glass that presented fewer FCLs were predominantly lying on top of an FN - rich region of the culture ( Fig . S1b ) . Next , we asked if the lowered FCL frequency observed in FN - coated samples is a cell - wide effect or speciﬁc to cellular regions in direct contact with the extracellular substrate . For that , we used patterned dishes containing FN - coated regions interspersed with uncoated ( glass ) regions , where single U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells could 2 Figure 1 .

In line with a contact - dependent effect , few FCLs were observed in cellular regions in contact with FN whereas FCLs were abundant in the cellular regions contacting glass ( Fig . 1d - g , Supplementary video 2 ) . The abundance of an alternative splice variant of the clathrin heavy chain containing exon 31 was recently shown to increase the frequency of FCLs ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We thus decided to test if the effects we observe are due to changes in clathrin splicing but found no difference when comparing cells plated on uncoated or FN - coated dishes ( Fig . S1c ) . Thus , the formation of FCLs is controlled by the composition of the extracellular matrix with FN being a strong inhibitor of FCL formation . Importantly , this control occurs in a local manner , where FCL inhibition depends on direct contact with the ECM ( Fig . 1g ) . Fibronectin locally inhibits Reticular Adhesions Reticular adhesions ( RAs ) are composed of integrin α v β 5 and are the only type of cellular adhesion maintained during mitosis , playing important roles controlling this process and ensuring spatial memory between cell generations ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) . FCLs were shown to localise to RAs ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . However , the signiﬁcance of this colocalisation is largely unexplored . First , we conﬁrmed these previous ﬁnding in our model system . Indeed , U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells plated on glass and stained for integrin α v β 5 and the FA markers phosphorylated paxillin ( p - PAX Y118 ) or phosphorylated Focal Adhesion Kinase ( p - FAK Y397 ) displayed RAs which were positive for bright AP2 - GFP puncta ( i . e . FCLs ) but not the FA markers , as reported ( Lock et al . , 2018 ; Wehrle - Haller , 2012 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) ( Fig . 2a , b ; Fig . S2a , b ) . Furthermore , RAs could also be differentiated from FAs for the absence of associated actin stress ﬁbres ( Fig . S2c ) . Next , given the strong effects of FN on FCLs , we asked how FN coating affected RAs . Strikingly , cells plated on patterned FN revealed that RAs , akin to FCLs , were completely inhibited on cellular regions in contact with FN . The glass side of coverslips displayed many FCLs colocalising to RAs while on the FN - coated side , neither RAs nor FCLs were present ( Fig . 2c - e ) . While in patterned substrates most of the integrin α v β 5 signal segregated to glass regions forming typical RAs ( Fig . 2c , d ) , the integrin α v β 5 signal localised to FAs in cells plated on fully coated FN dishes ( Fig . S3 ) . Interestingly , the amount of integrin α v β 5 signal localising to FAs decreased with cell density ( Fig . S3 ) . In line with previous observations ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) , FCL formation was dependent on integrin α v β 5 as U2OS AP2 - GFP cells silenced for integrin β 5 displayed a lower FCL frequency compared to control cells ( Fig . S4a - c ) . Integrin 3 Figure 2 .

The dependency of integrin β 5 on FCL formation was further conﬁrmed using Cilengitide , the inhibitor for integrin α v β 5 ( Desgrosellier and Cheresh , 2010 ) , as the treatment led to a rapid disassembly of FCLs ( Fig . S5 ) . Hence , the composition of the extracellular matrix controls the formation of RAs and FCLs in a very similar manner ( Fig . 2e ) , suggesting a common mechanism for the establishment of these structures . The CME machinery nucleates RA formation While all FCLs colocalise to RAs , the opposite is not true ( Fig . 2a , Fig . S2 ) , which may give the impression that FCLs are formed on existing RAs . Nevertheless , the fact that both structures are inhibited independently by FN suggests a deeper relationship , and led us to ask if RAs can exist without the CME machinery . To answer this question , we quantiﬁed the amount of RAs in U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for the clathrin adaptor AP2 complex subunits alpha 1 ( AP2A1 ) or sigma 1 ( AP2S1 ) . Cells for this experiment were plated on glass to support RA formation . Consistent with a key role played by the CME machinery in RA formation , AP2A1 or AP2S1 silenced cells ( easily recognisable as cells with little to no AP2 - GFP signal ) , did not display RAs . Instead , integrin α v β 5 localised to the FA marker , while control cells displayed prominent RAs ( Fig . 3a , b ; Figs S6 , S7 ) . To conﬁrm these results , we expressed the AP180 C - terminal fragment ( AP180ct ) , which acts as a strong dominant negative of CME ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . AP180ct - positive U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells on glass displayed low AP2 signal at the membrane and , akin to AP2 silenced cells , RAs were largely absent with integrin α v β 5 localised to FAs , whereas AP180ct - negative cells displayed typical FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 3c - e ) . Next , we set out to visualise the dynamics of AP2 during RA formation . For that , we generated a double U2OS knock - in cell line - AP2 - GFP and Integrin β 5 ( ITGB5 ) - mScarlet . RAs are remarkably stable structures ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) and their de novo formation is rare , making it difﬁcult to capture such events . To overcome this problem , we optimised the conditions for Cilengitide treatment to disassemble RAs followed by a washout , when RAs could start reforming ( Fig . S8 ) . Using these washout conditions , we were able to capture 4 Figure 3 .

S9 ; Supplementary videos 3 , 4 ) . Also , in events where we could not clearly detect the extension of a mature RA , we noticed that the establishment of an FCL was typically accompanied by an increase in ITGB5 ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 3g ; Fig . S9 ) . Taken together , our results show that the relationship between FCLs and RAs is beyond a simple colocalisation . In fact , our data reveals a strict co - dependency , where FCLs are required for the initial integrin α v β 5 clustering required for RA formation ( Fig . 3e , h ) . Matrix binding of integrin β 1 controls RA and FCL formation To understand the mechanism controlling the co - assembly of FCLs and RAs we turned our attention back to FN . We focused on integrin β 1 , which forms heterodimers that function as major FN receptors ( Humphries et al . , 2006 ) . First , we acutely interfered with integrin β 1’s capacity to bind FN using the function - blocking antibody mab13 . U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells seeded on FN coated dishes were treated with mab13 and observed for the formation of FCLs and RAs . Over the time course of 45 min , mab13 induced the relocalisation of integrin α v β 5 from FAs to small , newly formed RAs ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Further supporting the role of FCLs in RA assembly , these newly formed RAs completely colocalised with FCLs ( bright AP2 signals ) ( Fig . 4c ) . A similar experiment followed by live - cell imaging conﬁrmed these results and showed an increase in FCL frequency after mab13 treatment ( Fig . 4d ) . Mab13 treatment had no effect on existing FCLs and RAs formed on glass ( Fig . S10 ) . In concert with the results above , integrin β 1 silenced U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN had a high FCL frequency and prominent RAs ( Fig . 5 , Fig . S11 ) . Thus , the activation of integrin β 1 by extracellular FN inhibits the formation of RAs and FCLs . 5 Figure 4 .

Discussion The extracellular environment is a key regulator of cellular physiology with integrins playing a key role translating the chemical composition of the extracellular milieu into intracellular signals . Among various mechanisms controlling integrin function , integrin trafﬁcking via endocytosis and exocytosis plays a major role ( Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Thus far , the relationship between integrin - based matrix adhesions and endocytosis has been considered primarily antagonistic , with endocytosis playing a role in the disassembly of said adhesive structures ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Here we provide evidence , for the ﬁrst time , of a constructive relationship between the endocytic machinery and cellular adhesions . We present a novel mechanism where the CME machinery , in the form of FCLs , is key for the formation of integrin α v β 5 - based RAs . We observed that FCL - mediated RA nucleation events are extremely rare , which led us to use a cilengitide washout experiment to detect them . For this reason , the trigger for the formation of FCLs and establishment of RAs remains to be understood . Recent evidence showed that EGFR activation led to the enlargement of FCLs in an integrin β 5 phosphorylation - dependent manner ( Alfonzo - Méndez et al . , 2022 ) , pointing to a possible mechanism for the initial co - assembly of FCLs and RAs . This possibility is further reinforced by the fact that the relationship between growth factor receptors and integrins has been established in multiple contexts ( Ivaska and Heino , 2011 ) . Another key unknown aspect of FCL - mediated RA nucleation concerns how these structures can be molecularly differentiated from canonical endocytic events . The connection between integrin α v β 5 located in RAs and FCLs occurs primarily via the endocytic adaptors ARH and NUMB ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , these adaptors also participate in integrin endocytosis ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) , suggesting that other mechanisms may be required to deﬁne the identity of FCLs . Recently , a correlation was found between the presence of FCLs and an alternatively spliced isoform of clathrin containing exon 31 ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We did not detect any changes in clathrin splicing in our experimental system , which was not surprising given the effects we see are contact - dependent and could not be explained by transcriptional changes . Nonetheless , it is possible that the abundance of the exon 31 - positive clathrin isoform works as a dial that changes the probability , speed or efﬁciency by which cells form FCLs . We propose the following model for the formation of RAs by FCLs . In the absence ( or low levels ) of FN , the CME machinery binds to integrin α v β 5 on the plasma membrane via adaptors 6 Figure 5 . Depletion of integrin β 1 promotes FCL and RA formation . a - d , U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for integrin β 1 with two different shRNAs ( shITGB # 1 , # 2 ) or control shRNA were plated on FN and imaged using TIRF microscopy 1 s intervals for 5 min ( a , b ) , or stained for integrin α v β 5 and p - PAX and imaged using TIRF microscopy ( c , d ) . a , b , Representative kymographs of 5 min time - lapse videos ( a ) , and analysis of FCL ratio from time - lapse videos ( b ) , shScr n = 12 videos , shITGB1 # 1 n = 11 videos , shITGB1 # 2 n = 10 videos , Tukey’s multiple comparison . c , d , Representative TIRF images ( c ) and RA coverage analysis ( d ) , control shRNA n = 30 , shITGB1 # 1 n = 27 , shITGB1 # 2 n = 18 , One - way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison .

Polymerisation of clathrin establishes an FCL leading to integrin α v β 5 clustering and formation of a nascent RA . These newly formed RAs can then further expand , outgrowing the FCL . In conditions of abundant FN , high levels of integrin β 1 are activated leading to FCL inhibition and integrin α v β 5 accumulation on FAs . The mechanism behind the RA - expansion beyond FCLs after their nucleation , or the molecular players linking integrin β 1 activation to FCL inhibition are not known and are key questions for further investigation . RAs persist during mitosis and their integrity is essential to maintain the division axis in cells , ensuring directional and efﬁcient cytokinesis ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) . Our results raise the intriguing possibility that the composition of the ECM , in combination with its orientation ( Théry et al . , 2005 ) , can be used by cells to locally control RA formation – and , consequently , mitotic directionality – during development . The requirement of FN accumulation during branching morphogenesis of salivary glands ( Sakai et al . , 2003 ) supports this hypothesis . In addition to its endocytic function , the clathrin machinery has been shown to participate in other processes . For example , clathrin helps to stabilise the mitotic spindle by binding to microtubules ( Royle , 2012 ) and , during E . coli infection , the CME machinery is co - opted to form a clathrin - based actin - rich adhesive structure for the bacteria called pedestal ( Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , a clathrin / AP2 tubular lattice was recently described to envelop collagen ﬁbres during cell migration ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . The results we present here add to this list of non - endocytic functions of CME components with an important twist . FCLs can also be disassembled into individual endocytic events ( Lampe et al . , 2016 ; Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ; Tagiltsev et al . , 2021 ) , providing an elegant and efﬁcient mechanism for cells to switch the same machinery from an adhesion assembly to an adhesion disassembly function .

The following primary antibodies were used : anti - human integrin beta 1 clones 12G10 ( Novus bio , NB100 - 63255 ) and mAb13 ( BD , 552828 ) , anti - human integrin alpha v beta 5 clone 15F11 ( Millipore MAB2019Z ) , anti - human p - paxillin Y118 ( Cell Signaling , 69363 ) and anti - human p - FAK Y397 ( Invitrogen , 44 - 624G ) . Corresponding secondary antibodies raised against rabbit or mouse IgG were from Jackson Immunoresearch . Coating of imaging dishes To compare the effect of several major extracellular matrix proteins on AP2 life - time , the glass coverslip areas ( 14 mm diameter ) of imaging dishes ( Mattek ) were pre - coated with 1 % ( 10 µg / ml , 300 µl in PBS ) of the following ECM proteins : recombinant human ﬁbronectin ( Merck , 341631 ) , recombinant human vitronectin ( PeproTech , 140 - 09 ) , collagen IV ( Santa cruz , se - 29010 ) , and collagen I ( Sigma , C3867 ) overnight at + 37°C , or left untreated . Alternatively , as non - ECM protein controls , 1 % BSA ( Thermo Fisher , A34785 ) or poly - L - lysine ( MP Biochemicals , 152690 ) were used . In further experiments FN coating was performed similarly . To study local vs . global effects of FN , FN was mixed with 50 ng / ml of Alexa647 - labelled BSA and used to precoat the imaging dishes overnight in + 37°C . The coated surface was subsequently scratched with a needle to allow partial reappearance of glass . After scratching , the dishes were rinsed 3x with PBS . 20 000 U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells were seeded on patterned imaging dishes to ensure sufﬁcient single - cell attachment to border areas . Overexpression of mammalian proteins . The clathrin inhibitor AP180 c - terminal fragment ( AP180ct ; amino acids 516 - 898 ) cDNA , from rat origin was described previously ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . This construct was cloned into a Gateway compatible pCI vectors , containing an N - terminal monomeric EGFP using the Gateway system . Transient transfections were carried out with PEI MAX transfection reagent ( Polysciences , 24765 - 1 ) using 70 % conﬂuent U2OS cells . Genetic engineering of cell lines U2OS - AP2 - GFP cell line Three guide RNA ( gRNA ) sequences ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) were designed using the Welcome Sanger Institute Genome online editing tool ( / / https : / / wge . stemcell . sanger . ac . uk / ) . gRNAs were cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX459 ) V2 . 0 ( gift from . Feng Zhang , Addgene # 62988 ) using BbsI sites and conﬁrmed by sanger sequencing . gRNAs were transfected with the donor template for homologous recombination and the most effective gRNA ( TGCTACAGTCCCTGGAGTGA ) , judged by the percentage of ﬂuorescent cells by FACS , was used for single clone selection , genotyping and conﬁrmation by microscopy . The donor template sequence was : GGCCAGCATCCTGGGGGGCCTCGTCTCACCCCAGGGTCTCCCCTCACACAGGTTTACACGGTCGTGGACGAGATGTTCCTGGCTGGCGAAATCCGAGAGACCA GCCAGACGAAGGTGCTGAAACAGCTGCTGATGCTACAGTCCCTGGAGGGAAGTGCATCTGGGAGCTCAGGCGCTAGTGGTTCAGCGAGCGGGGTGAGCAAG GGCGAGGAGCTGTTCACCGGGGTGGTGCCCATCCTGGTCGAGCTGGACGGCGACGTAAACGGCCACAAGTTCAGCGTGTCCGGCGAGGGCGAGGGCGATG CCACCTACGGCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATCTGCACCACCGGCAAGCTGCCCGTGCCCTGGCCCACCCTCGTGACCACCCTGACCTACGGCGTGCAGTGCTT 9 CAGCCGCTACCCCGACCACATGAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTCAAGTCCGCCATGCCCGAAGGCTACGTCCAGGAGCGCACCATCTTCTTCAAGGACGACGGCAAC TACAAGACCCGCGCCGAGGTGAAGTTCGAGGGCGACACCCTGGTGAACCGCATCGAGCTGAAGGGCATCGACTTCAAGGAGGACGGCAACATCCTGGGGCA CAAGCTGGAGTACAACTACAACAGCCACAACGTCTATATCATGGCCGACAAGCAGAAGAACGGCATCAAGGTGAACTTCAAGATCCGCCACAACATCGAGGAC GGCAGCGTGCAGCTCGCCGACCACTACCAGCAGAACACCCCCATCGGCGACGGCCCCGTGCTGCTGCCCGACAACCACTACCTGAGCACCCAGTCCAAGCT GAGCAAAGACCCCAACGAGAAGCGCGATCACATGGTCCTGCTGGAGTTCGTGACCGCCGCCGGGATCACTCTCGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGTGAGGGC AGGCGAGCCCCACCCCGGCCCCGGCCCCTCCTGGACTCGCCTGCTCGCTTCCCCTTCCCAGGCCCGTGGCCAACCCAGCAGTCCTTCCCTCAGCTGCCTAGGA GGAAGGGACCCAGCTGGGTCTGGGCCACAAGGGAGGAGACTGC where C terminal tagging with GFP is in green ( codon - optimized ) + short linker in purple . 150 bp homology arms ( orange ) were incorporated via PCR ampliﬁcation from a synthesized ( IDT ) , codon - optimized monomeric EGFP . dsPCR product was puriﬁed and 150 ng was used directly for transfection together with gRNAs . 70 - 80 % conﬂuent 24 well of U2OS cells were transfected with 2 μ l PEI ( 1 mg / ml ) , 150 ng of plasmid and 150 ng of the PCR product . Two days after transfection cells were treated with puromycin ( 1 μ g / ml ) to enrich for successfully transfected cells . After expansion , GFP - positive cells were sorted by FACS , and single clones were expanded and genotyped . U2OS - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cell line This cell line was produced by the same protocol as the U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells with the following changes : The gRNA sequence was CAAATCCTACAATGGCACTG , and the donor template was : GGTTTGAGTGTGTGAGCTAACATGTGTCCTCATCCTCTTCCCCGCCGTGTTCTGTAGGCTTCAAATCCATTATACAGAAAGCCTATCTCCACGCACACTGTGGACTTCA CCTTCAACAAGTTCAACAAATCATATAACGGCACTGTTGAC GGAAGTGCATCTGGGAGCTCAGGCGCTAGTGGTTCAGCGAGCGGGgtgagcaagggcgaggcagtgatcaaggagttcatgcggttcaaggtgcacatggagggctccatgaa cggccacgagttcgagatcgagggcgagggcgagggccgcccctacgagggcacccagaccgccaagctgaaggtgaccaagggtggccccctgcccttctcctgggacatcctgtcccctcagt tcatgtacggctccagggccttcatcaagcaccccgccgacatccccgactactataagcagtccttccccgagggcttcaagtgggagcgcgtgatgaacttcgaggacggcggcgccgtgaccgtg acccaggacacctccctggaggacggcaccctgatctacaaggtgaagctccgcggcaccaacttccctcctgacggccccgtaatgcagaagaagacaatgggctgggaagcatccaccgagcg gttgtaccccgaggacggcgtgctgaagggcgacattaagatggccctgcgcctgaaggacggcggccgctacctggcggacttcaagaccacctacaaggccaagaagcccgtgcagatgccc ggcgcctacaacgtcgaccgcaagttggacatcacctcccacaacgaggactacaccgtggtggaacagtacgaacgctccgagggccgccactccaccgg cggcatggacgagctgtacaagTAA TGTTTCCTTCTCCGAGGGGCTGGAGCGGGGATCTGATGAAAAGGTCAGACTGAAACGCCTTGCACGGCTGCTCGGCTTGATCACAGCTCCCTAGGTAGGCACCA CAGAGAAGACCTTCTAGTGAGCCTGGGCCAGGAGCCCACAGTGCCT where A = silent mutations in 5’ HA , linker region is in purple , and mScarlet is in orange . Lentiviral shRNA production and transduction Lentiviruses for shRNA production were made using packaging plasmids pCMVR and pMD2 . g and speciﬁc shRNAs in pLKO . 1 vector as follows : 80 % conﬂuent HEK293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 100U penicillin - streptomycin were transfected using PEI MAX transfection reagent . 5 hours later , the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 4 % FBS and 25mM HEPES . Media containing lentiviral particles were harvested after 48 and 72 hours , ﬁltered ( 0 . 45 μ m ) , aliquoted and stored in - 80°C . U2OS - AP2 - GFP were transduced with lentiviral media expressing respective shRNAs in the presence of Polybren 8 µg / ml ( Sigma - Aldrich , TR - 1003 ) for 5 hours , and replaced with culture medium . 48 h later , puromycin ( 1 μ g / ml ) was added for 24 h to allow selection of transduced cells . Experiments targeting AP2 subunits were performed otherwise similarly but without puromycin selection . All shRNA silenced cell lines were replated to glass - bottomeed imaging dishes one day prior to imaging . 10 The following sequences were targeted : Integrin beta 5 targeting ( ITGB5 ) shRNAs : TRCN0000057744 ( GCATCCAACCAGATGGACTAT ) , TRCN0000057745 ( GCTGTGCTATGTTTCTACAAA ) Integrin beta 1 targeting ( ITGB1 ) shRNAs : TRCN0000029644 ( CCTGTTTACAAGGAGCTGAAA ) , TRCN0000029645 ( GCCTTGCATTACTGCTGATAT ) AP2 sigma 1 targeting ( AP2S1 ) shRNAs : TRCN0000060263 ( GACGCCAAACACACCAACTTT ) , TRCN0000060266 ( GTGGAGGTCTTAAACGAATAT ) , TRCN0000060267 ( CACAACTTCGTGGAGGTCTTA ) . AP2 alpha 1 ( AP2A1 ) targeting shRNAs : TRCN0000065108 ( GCTGAATAAGTTTGTGTGTAA ) , TRCN0000065109 ( GCACATTGACACCGTCATCAA ) Clathrin exon 31 analysis Cell culture dishes were coated with 10 µg / ml of FN in a cell culture incubator , or left uncoated . Next day , U2OS cells were plated to reach conﬂuency in 24 h . RNA extraction , cDNA synthesis , and PCR followed those described by Moulay et al . ( 2020 ) with minor variations . Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent with an additional acidic phenol ( pH 5 . 4 ) extraction step to remove genomic DNA contamination . cDNA synthesis from 1 µg total RNA was carried out RNA using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and oligo dT12 – 18 ( Life Technologies ) . No enzyme reactions were included to conﬁrm that no genomic DNA was present . PCR was performed using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) with no other variations from Moulay et al . , ( 2020 ) . Primers used were : F’ TGC CCT ATT TCA TCC AGG TCA , R’ ATG GGT TGT GTC TCT GTA GC . Gel images were acquired using a GelDoc XL ( Bio Rad ) . Microscopy All live videos and images from ﬁxed samples were acquired with an ONI nanoimager microscope equipped with 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 lasers , an Olympus 1 . 4NA 100x super achromatic objective and a Hamamatsu sCMOS Orca ﬂash 4 V3 camera . Endogenous AP2 life - time monitoring 35 000 U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells were plated to precoated / glass area of the dish resulting in approximately 70 - 80 % conﬂuency 20 h later , at the onset of imaging . Alternatively , shRNA silenced cell lines were plated . After overnight culture , 25 µM HEPES was added and samples were subjected to live TIRF imaging in a pre - heated + 37°C chamber . The ONI nanoimager microscope set to TIRF angle was used to acquire AP2 lifetimes at the cell membrane from 300 frames ( 1 frame / s ) with the exposure time of 330 ms . Each video represents endocytic events from 2 - 3 cells . Acute manipulation of integrin activity Acute modulation of ligand binding activity for integrin β 1 was achieved using the function blocking antibody mab13 ( 0 . 3 µg / ml ) . U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on FN as explained above , mab13 was added , and 5 min time lapses were continuously collected 5 min after the addition of mab13 until 35 min , control videos ( time point 0 ) had no mab13 added . To acutely induce the formation of FCL and RAs we used the small molecular inhibitor Cilengitide ( MedChem Express HY - 16141 , 10uM ) . U2OS - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells plated on uncoated imaging dishes were treated with Cilengitide for 15 min , washed twice , and imaged with the ONI nanoimager microscope at TIRF angle at 30 s intervals , with an exposure time of 100 ms for AP2 and 300 ms for integrin - β 5 . Immunoﬂuorescent staining and imaging For immunoﬂuorescent studies , cell were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde - PBS for 15 min in a + 37°C incubator , washed with PBS and blocked with 1 % BSA - PBS . Primary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA - PBS were incubated for 1 h , samples were washed with PBS , and secondary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA - PBS were let to bind for 30 min . Samples were imaged with the ONI nanoimager microscope using TIRF angle and exposure times of 500 ms or 1000 ms . 11 Manipulation of CME machinery to study RA formation Clathrin assembly at the cell membrane was reduced by silencing two subdomains of AP2 , or by overexpressing AP180ct , which acts as a dominant negative for AP2 . U2OS AP2 - GFP cells silenced for AP2A1 shRNA # 1 and # 2 or AP2S1 shRNA # 1 , # 2 and # 3 , and control shRNA , and plated on uncoated imaging dishes were ﬁxed and stained for integrin α v β 5 and FA marker p - PAX . Alternatively , AP180ct was overexpressed in U2OS AP2 - GFP cells and cells were plated on uncoated imaging dishes , ﬁxed the next day , and stained for integrin α v β 5 and p - PAX . RA formation ( integrin α v β 5 adhesions w / o FA marker ) and FAs ( integrin α v β 5 colocalising with FA marker ) were imaged using TIRF microscopy . Manipulation of integrin activity and availability We performed time series experiments to block integrin β 1 active conformation with the mab13 antibody or to inhibit integrin α v β 5 with Cilengitide . Experiments utilizing mab13 were performed with U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN coated dishes to disfavour the preformation of FCLs and RAs . Mab13 ( 0 . 3 µg / ml ) was added to replicate samples and ﬁxed 15 , 30 or 45 min later . Similarly , U2OS - AP2 - GFP cells plated on uncoated dishes to favour the preformation of FCLs and RAs , were treated with Cilengitide . Samples were stained for integrin α v β 5 and FA marker p - PAX . Alternatively , after 15 min of Cilengitide treatment , samples were washed and ﬁxed at several time points ( Fig . S8 ) after Cilengitide washout to monitor reappearance of FCL and RAs . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for integrin β 1 or β 5 and control were plated either on FN coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB1 shRNAs ) or on uncoated ( glass ) dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB5 shRNAs ) , and ﬁxed the next day . Samples were stained for integrin α v β 5 and FA marker p - PAX and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Image analyses CME lifetime analyses ( FCL frequency ) To track CME events and measure lifetimes we used ' u - track 2 . 0 ' multiple - particle tracking MATLAB software at default settings ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) . To determine the frequency of FCLs , we counted the number of pits ( events lasting longer than 20 s and shorter than 120 s ) and the number of FCLs ( events lasting longer than 120 seconds , as described in ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) ) in every frame , and calculated the FCL frequency ( number of FCLs / number of FCLs + number of pits ) . Mean FCL frequency was taken as the average FCL frequency of all frames more than 120 seconds from the beginning and the end of each video . Qualitative analysis of RAs U2OS - AP2 - GFP - ITGB1 - mScarlet cells ﬁxed at several time points after Cilengitide washout were analysed for reappearance of RAs ( Fig . S8 ) . The samples were sub grouped into four categories ( 0 - 3 ) , according to the stage of RA - development . Group 0 ( green ) had no RAs , group 1 ( orange ) had few dot - like RAs ( punctate integrin α v β 5 + FCL , no p - PAX ) , group 2 ( purple ) had many dot - like RAs and a few bigger RAs , and group 3 ( blue ) had several big RAs . Other analyses : With the exception of FCL frequencies , all image analyses were performed using imageJ . Simple ﬂuorescence measurements were done using manually . Others were performed using custom scripts as shown below : RA coverage ( Figs 3b , 3d , 5d ) Individual cells were marked and ITGB5 and P - PAX channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . RAs were deﬁned as ITGB5 signals not colocalizing with p - PAX . The area of RAs were then dived by the area of each marked cell to obtain RA coverage . 12 AP2 - ITGB5 dynamics ( Fig . 3g ) Events showing the appearance of both AP2 and ITGB5 were identiﬁed by visual inspection of videos . For the generation of graphs , we selected only events where we could unambiguously ensure that signiﬁcant FCLs and ITGB5 signals were not present in the region for at least 3 minutes . Time zero was deﬁned as the frame where AP2 signal appeared and ﬂuorescence Intensity from a 10µm x 10µm region around each event was measure for 3 minutes before ( 6 frames ) and 5 minutes after ( 10 frames ) . Fluorescence was normalised to the highest value in these frames . AP2 intensity per colocalisation status ( Figs 4b , S5b , S2b ) AP2 , ITGB5 and P - PAX channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . Each segmented AP2 spot had the ﬂuorescence intensity measured from the original image and classiﬁed for its colocalisation with either markers ( ITGB5 or p - PAX ) . We used full images for these analyses . RAs colocalising to AP2 ( Fig . 4c ) Individual cells were marked and AP2 , ITGB5 and P - PAX channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . RAs were deﬁned as ITGB5 signals not colocalizing with p - PAX . In the conditions used of these experiments , ( FN + mab13 ) RAs we primarily individual spots . The colocalisation of RAs to AP2 was classiﬁed by measuring the intensity of each RA region at the segmented AP2 channel . FN intensity vs AP2 intensity ( Fig . S1b ) AP2 , ITGB5 and P - PAX channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . Each segmented AP2 spot had the ﬂuorescence intensity measured from the original image . A 3µm x 3µm region was drawn around each AP2 spot and used to measure the intensity of FN from the original image . Data is presented as the ﬂuorescence for each AP2 spot . Statistics All results were repeated at least 3 - 5 times . Figure legends state the exact n - values used in analyses . For multiple comparisons one - way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison . Pairwise comparisons were performed using two - tailed Student’s t - test with equal variance . All graphs and statistical calculations were performed in GraphPad 13
