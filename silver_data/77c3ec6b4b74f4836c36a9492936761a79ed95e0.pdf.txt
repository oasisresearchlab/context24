R E V I E W : C E L L B I O L O G Y Mechanism of Actin - Based Motility Dominique Pantaloni , Christophe Le Clainche , Marie - France Carlier * Spatially controlled polymerization of actin is at the origin of cell motility and is responsible for the formation of cellular protrusions like lamellipodia . The pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella (cid:223)exneri , which undergo actin - based propulsion , are acknowledged models of the leading edge of lamellipodia . Actin - based motility of the bacteria or of functionalized microspheres can be reconstituted in vitro from only (cid:222)ve pure proteins . Movement results from the regulated site - directed treadmilling of actin (cid:222)laments , consistent with observations of actin dynamics in living motile cells and with the biochemical properties of the components of the synthetic motility medium . E ukaryotic cells have the ability to organize directed movements to migrate , feed , di - vide , or drive internal transport of materi - als ( 1 ) . The direction of movement is mediated in different ways in cells and is associated with dissipation of energy . Molecular motors are the archetype of protein machines that transport organelles along microtubules and actin fila - ments in a unidirectional fashion , converting the free energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into directed movement . Another type of directional , ATP - con - suming movement is the amoeboid crawling motion [ ( 1 , 2 ) ; see also supplemental slides 1 to 4 ( 3 ) ] , mediated by the polarized assembly of a polymer . The most widespread example is actin - based motility , driven by the assem - bly of actin filaments . Actin - based motility describes a variety of cellular processes through which living cells change shape in response to environmental signals , or extend protrusions like lamellipodia and filopodia , or wrap around a particle in a phagocytic cup . Progress in understanding the mechanism by which actin polymerization generates move - ment resulted from advances in different fields . Genetic and immunocytochemical studies identified several important actin - binding proteins in motility ; biochemical analysis characterized the function of these proteins ; “live” observations of actin dynam - ics in motile regions of cells provided hints about the reactions involved ; and last , but not least , the bacterial pathogens Listeria mono - cytogenes and Shigella flexneri , which ex - hibit actin - based movement in the host cy - toplasm , have been instrumental in identi - fying essential factors in motility and in developing biophysical assays for move - ment analysis ( 4 , 5 ) . From Lamellipodium Extension to Listeria Propulsion Actin is one of the most abundant protein in all eukaryotes . [ For this section , see sup - plemental slides 5 and 6 ( 3 ) . ] In physiolog - ical medium , this 43 - kD globular protein polymerizes itself into polar , helical fila - ments in which subunits are connected by a 167° rotation and 2 . 7 - nm axial rise . Irre - versible hydrolysis of the bound ATP asso - ciated with polymerization is at the origin of treadmilling ( 6 ) and destabilizes the fil - ament ( 7 ) . Treadmilling plays a crucial role in the function of actin in motility ( Fig . 1A ) . In the 1980s , it was recognized that the polarized array of actin filaments turns over rapidly in the lamellipodium . Filament barbed ends facing the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the lamellipodium were growing , while pointed ends of the filaments were depolymerizing at the rear , in a tread - milling process ( 8 ) . A similar orientation of filaments exists in the “comet tail” of Listeria in infected cells , barbed ends facing the sur - face of the bacterium ( 9 ) . This arrangement suggested an insertional polymerization mechanism for force production . During la - mellipodium extension and Listeria propul - sion , the rate of barbed - end growth equaled the rate of movement ( 10 , 11 ) , bringing the first clear evidence for actin assembly as the driving force and for the potential of Listeria and Shigella as models of the leading edge of the lamellipodium . The in vitro monitoring of Listeria movement in cell extracts ( 12 ) then converted a complex cell biology problem into a biochemically tractable problem , and opened the way to the full reconstitution of actin - based movement from a minimum set of purified components . Actin networks continuously generated at the leading edge or at the surface of Listeria display features characteristic of a steady - state process : the filament array has a constant length , shows a stationary gra - dient of density from the leading edge to the rear of the lamellipodium ( or from the surface of the bacterium to the end of the actin comet tail ) , and the array treadmills rapidly . Typically , a 3 - m m - long filament turns over in 1 min , that is , 100 times as fast as pure actin in vitro . How can these observations be translated in terms of bio - chemical reactions ? The steady - state con - centration of monomeric actin reflects the dynamic state of actin filaments ( Fig . 1A ) . For pure actin , it is very close to the barbed - end critical concentration , so that slow , steady barbed - end growth balances slow pointed - end depolymerization . Steady barbed - end growth ( as well as pointed - end depolymerization ) is two orders of magni - tude faster in lamellipodium and in the actin tails of Listeria . This fact implies that , in vivo , the concentration of active mono - meric actin is maintained at a much higher value by factors that control the dynamics of assembly at the two ends of the actin filament . Regulatory Factors Controlling Actin Treadmilling Two proteins control actin dynamics inde - pendently to achieve this function : actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also called cofilin ) and capping proteins . ADF proteins are essential in morphogenetic and motile processes [ For this section , see supplemen - tal slides 7 to 15 ( 3 ) . ] Most of them are regulated by phosphorylation in a stimulus - responsive fashion ( 13 ) . A Rac - regulated LIM kinase inactivates ADF ; the activating phosphatase is unknown ( 14 ) . The bio - chemical properties of ADF account for its biological function . ADF accelerates point - ed - end depolymerization , which is the rate - limiting step in the treadmilling ATPase cycle ( 15 ) . As a result , a higher steady - state concentration of monomeric ATP - actin is established in F - actin solutions , which sup - ports faster barbed - end growth , balancing faster pointed - end depolymerization ( Fig . 1B ) . In enhancing treadmilling , ADF in - creases the rate of actin - based motility . ADF has also been proposed to affect mo - tility by severing the filaments ( 16 ) . How - ever , cutting the filaments creates as many growing barbed ends as depolymerizing pointed ends , thus increasing the bulk turn - over but not the intrinsic treadmilling of filaments . Therefore , severing the filaments in itself cannot affect motility ( 17 ) .

Profilin is involved in motile processes mediated by actin polymerization . Newly dis - covered proteins of the actobindin family , like Drosophila Ciboulot ( 20 ) , are functional homologs of profilin . Profilin specifically binds ATP - monomeric actin ( ATP – G - actin ) in a complex that has the unique property of associating exclusively with barbed ends ( 21 , 22 ) . Profilin shifts the distribution of mono - meric actin at steady state : The large pool of ADF – ADP – G - actin , which undergoes asso - ciation - dissociation reactions at the pointed ends , is converted into the ATP - bound profi - lin - actin complex , which polymerizes at barbed ends only . The processivity of tread - milling therefore is enhanced by profilin . In vitro , treadmilling is accelerated 125 - fold by the synergistic effects of ADF and profilin , reaching values close to those found in vivo ( 23 ) . Not all G - actin – binding proteins affect the rate of motility the way profilin does . Proteins like b - thymosins make a complex with G - actin that does not participate in assembly at either end ( 24 ) . Hence , they do not modify filament dynamics or the rate of movement ( 20 ) . These proteins are some - times thought to buffer the free ATP – G - actin concentration . Instead , the amount of sequestered actin is determined by the val - ue of the concentration of ATP – G - actin imposed by filament dynamics , according to the law of mass action ( 25 ) . The changes in free ATP – G - actin elicited by regulators like ADF lead to changes in sequestered actin that are more than one order of mag - nitude greater . Motile cells contain a large pool of sequestered actin . Capping proteins are required for effi - cient motility of many cells ( 26 – 28 ) . By blocking a large fraction of the barbed ends , capping proteins funnel the flux of pointed - end depolymerization to feed the growth of a few noncapped filaments , which individually grow faster than if the other filaments were not capped . In conclu - sion , ADF and capping proteins cooperate in promoting fast actin - based motility ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . In the treadmilling cycle , capping pro - teins are recycled after depolymerization of capped filaments and eventually cap the growing barbed ends . Maintenance of a steady number of transiently growing barbed ends requires the constant genera - tion of barbed ends . The cellular factor that generates new filaments in a site - directed , signaling - controlled fashion is the Arp2 / 3 complex . WASP Family Proteins Connect Signaling to Polarized Assembly of Actin Evidence for a role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in the spatial control of actin assembly first came from studies of actin - based motility of Listeria . The Arp2 / 3 complex , a conserved ubiquitous complex of seven polypeptides comprising actin - related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 , stimulates actin polymerization at the surface of the bacterium when it is activated by the Listeria protein ActA ( 29 , 30 ) .

( A ) Intrinsic treadmill - ing of actin (cid:222)laments re(cid:223)ects the energetic imbalance between the barbed and the pointed ends . Pointed - end disassembly , the rate - limiting step of the actin ATPase cycle , controls the rate of barbed - end growth and the steady - state concentration of monomer - ic ATP - actin , C SS . The rate of treadmilling is r 5 k 1 B ( C SS — C CB ) 5 k 1 P ( C CP — C SS ) , where k 1 B and k 1 P are the forward rate constants for association of G - actin to barbed and pointed ends , and C CB and C CP the corre - sponding critical concentrations .

( B ) ADF accelerates treadmilling by increas - ing the reverse rate constant k —P . C SS there - fore settles at a higher value so that the rate of barbed - end growth , r 5 k 1 B ( C SS — C CB ) , balances faster pointed - end depolymeriza - tion . ( C ) Capping proteins ( CPs ) bias the treadmilling process . Blockage of a large frac - tion of barbed ends increases C SS . Noncapped barbed ends therefore grow faster .

S C I E N C E (cid:213) S C O M P A S S www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 292 25 MAY 2001 1503 Cellular activators of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex are members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family ( 31 – 34 ) . These scaffolding multimodular proteins connect actin to a variety of signaling path - ways involving receptor tyrosine kinases , heterotrimeric GTP - binding proteins ( G proteins ) , or the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac through the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2 ) . The conserved isolated COOH - terminal do - main of WASPS constitutively activates the Arp2 / 3 complex . The other domains are targets of diverse signaling molecules . Structural and biochemical studies using shorter versions of the full - length WASP or N - WASP ( the ubiquitous neural isoform of WASP ) indicate that an intramolecular bond maintains these proteins in an autoin - hibited conformation ( 35 – 37 ) . The cooper - ative binding of the Cdc42 - GTP , phospha - tidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , or SH3 domain - containing proteins ( like Grb2 ) , or pro - filin in the presence of lipids ( 38 – 41 ) , targets N - WASP to the sites of signaling and changes the structure of the protein , allowing interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . By this mechanism , actin polymerization is stimulated locally , in a manner that may be modulated up or down by the input of several signals , possibly cooperat - ing in a lipid “raft , ” at the leading edge . It is remarkable that IcsA , the surface protein of Shigella responsible for bacterial motility , binds N - WASP ( 42 ) and activates the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 machinery ( 43 ) . Shigella thus mimics the leading edge better than Listeria . The NH 2 - terminal domain of the Listeria protein ActA is a functional homolog of the COOH - terminal domain of WASP proteins ( 44 ) . The exact mechanism by which the focal adhesion protein VASP enhances Listeria movement in binding the central domain of ActA is not understood ( 6 , 7 ) . The Arp2 / 3 Complex Multiplies Filaments by Branching How does Arp2 / 3 locally stimulate the for - mation of new filaments ? Full understand - ing of Arp2 / 3 function will require much more structural and biochemical data than presently available . Immunolocalization of Arp2 / 3 in the lamellipodium , microscopic observations , and polymerization studies show that when activated by WASP pro - teins or by ActA , Arp2 / 3 multiplies the filaments by branching them . [ For this sec - tion , see supplemental slides 19 to 27 ( 3 ) . ] Actin filaments form a dendritic Y - branched array in the lamellipodium ; daughter branches grow at 70° angles from the mother branch ( the long branch of the “ Y ” ) . Arp2 / 3 is located at the branching points , and the barbed ends of the two branches face the leading edge of the la - mellipodium ( 19 ) . In solution , the WASP - or ActA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex initiates the formation of morphologically similar branched filaments ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) ( 44 – 47 ) . The kinetics of actin polymerization into branched filaments is autocatalytic , different from the nucleation - growth pro - cess for polymerization of pure actin , indi - cating that Arp2 / 3 generates new filaments by interacting with the product of the poly - merization reaction , F - actin ( 47 , 48 ) . No definite agreement has yet been reached concerning the exact mechanism by which the Arp2 / 3 complex causes the filaments to branch in solution . Side branching ( 48 , 49 ) and barbed - end branching ( 44 , 47 ) have been proposed . The two views have differ - ent implications regarding the length corre - lation of mother and daughter branches , and the ability of filaments with free or capped barbed ends to activate branching . In the barbed end – branching model , moth - er and daughter branches are expected to be equal in length , which was observed when branched filaments were formed in the ab - sence of phalloidin ( 47 ) . In the side - branching model , daughter branches should always be shorter than mother branches , and the expected length correlation coeffi - cient is 0 . 6 . In the presence of phalloidin , a total loss of correlation was observed ( 49 ) , suggesting that some other mechanism than the proposed side - branching model must have been operating . Gelsolin - capped fila - Fig . 2 . Signaling to actin at the leading edge of the lamellipodium . N - WASP is activated and targeted to the membrane by signaling molecules ( circled 1 ) . G - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex bind the exposed COOH - terminal domain of N - WASP ( VCA ) , forming a branching complex ( circled 2 ) . Association of the branching complex with a (cid:222)lament leads to the formation of a branch ( circled 3 ) . The two branches grow at equal rates . N - WASP catalyzes several consecutive cycles of branching .

The opposite result was obtained using a weaker capping protein , which , however , did not block all barbed ends ( 49 ) . In solution , branching of filaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex is followed by sponta - neous debranching ( 44 , 47 , 50 ) . Debranch - ing is about 20 % as fast as P i release after ATP hydrolysis on F - actin . The nature of the event that causes debranching is not elucidated yet . The localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex after debranching is not known either . The regulation of ATP bind - ing and / or hydrolysis on the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in the branching and / or debranching reactions and in the recycling of the Arp2 / 3 complex is of great interest regarding the morphogenesis of the dendritic arrays and the physics of movement . What are the features of filament branching at a surface ? In Shigella - infected cells , N - WASP remains bound to the bac - terial surface during movement , whereas Arp2 / 3 colocalizes with actin in the comet tail ( 43 ) . Similarly , N - WASP remains bound to the surface of rocketing endo - somes ( 51 ) . In addition , no branched fila - ments are seen with their barbed ends growing toward the rear of the lamellipo - dium . These facts indicate that branching is catalyzed locally by an immobilized en - zyme ( ActA or N - WASP ) , which transfers the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin to filament ends , to form a branch . When activated at the surface of a bead placed in a cell ex - tract , the Arp2 / 3 complex initiates the for - mation of multiply branched filaments ( Fig . 3D ) ( 52 ) , suggesting that individual fila - ment ends are transiently attached to the surface while branching . Mechanical stud - ies of Listeria movement ( 53 , 54 ) also indicate that filaments are transiently at - tached to the bacterium during movement . How Do Quiescent Cells Switch to a Motile Stationary State ? In quiescent , nonpolarized cells , all barbed ends are capped . Concerted regulation of different players may switch on motility , inducing a new polarized actin meshwork and rapid actin dynamics . We suggest that changes in the steady state of actin assem - bly elicit changes in the motile state of cells as follows . First , activation of ADF , by increasing ATP – G - actin concentration , leads to an increased amount of actin se - questered by b - thymosins and profilin , i . e . , causes massive depolymerization of F - ac - tin . Second , the high level of ATP – G - actin both favors nucleation and prompts rapid growth of barbed ends , generated upon ac - tivation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The cre - ation of barbed ends shifts the steady state of actin assembly toward the de novo for - mation of a polarized actin meshwork in the lamellipodium . The maintenance of a steady branched filament array may be viewed tentatively as follows . Constant filament branching oc - curs at the leading edge by activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Barbed - end growth is supported by a high concentration of mo - nomeric ATP - actin , maintained by ADF , profilin , and capping proteins . A steady number of growing barbed ends results from the balance between the creation of barbed ends by Arp2 / 3 and the blockage of these ends by capping proteins ; hence , the free barbed ends measured at a given time seem to escape capping ( 55 ) . A steady gra - dient of filament density results from the balance between the multiplication of fila - ments by branching and the debranching reaction followed by cooperative pointed - end depolymerization of filaments fiber by fiber , elicited by ADF . A question remains open : how are barbed ends first nucleated in a medium containing capping proteins ? The high steady - state concentration of ATP – G - actin supports significant sponta - neous formation of barbed - end nuclei , which cyclically appear , get capped by cap - ping proteins , and disassemble from their pointed ends . Nuclei and filaments escape this abortive cycle when they are captured by activated Arp2 / 3 at the leading edge of the lamellipodium or at the bacterial sur - face and are multiplied by branching . A Minimum Motility Medium for Sustained Actin - Based Movement The design of a minimal motility medium comes as a logical conclusion from the biochemical mechanism of control of actin dynamics . [ For this section , see supplemen - tal slides 28 to 34 ( 3 ) . ] The medium should contain ATP as an energy source , the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments in the presence of ADF , profilin , and capping pro - teins , making a chemostat of monomeric actin ( ATP – G - actin 1 profilin – ATP – G - ac - tin ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex multiplies barbed ends locally , by interacting with an activa - tor bound to a particle like Listeria , or N - WASP – coated Escherichia coli express - ing IcsA ( which is a good substitute for Shigella ) , or a functionalized ( ActA - or N - WASP – coated ) bead . Rapid actin - based movement of all these particles is actually observed in this medium ( 56 ) ( Fig . 3 , D to F ) . In the absence of ADF , capping proteins alone support extremely slow movement , actin tails are observable after 18 hours . Profilin improves motility but is not essen - tial , as previously demonstrated ( 57 , 58 ) . Efficient ActA - induced motility of Listeria or beads also requires VASP . It is notewor - thy that no myosin motor is involved . The concentrations of all components that yield optimum motility are similar to the in vivo concentrations , except for capping proteins , which are one order of magnitude more abundant in vivo , suggesting that their function might be regulated . The physical parameters of movement ( particle velocity of several microns per minute , length of the actin comet tails of a few microns , trajec - tories ) are similar to those observed in vivo or in cell extracts . The onset of movement is preceded , as in cell extracts , by the for - mation of a nonpolarized “cloud” of F - actin around the particle , followed by breakage of symmetry ( 59 ) and establishment of a stationary regime of movement . The simplicity of the composition of a minimum medium required for a self - orga - nizing motile system is consistent with the functioning of treadmilling supporting ac - tin - based motility ( 60 ) . Because movement is linked to the ATPase cycle of actin , effectors acting on a critical step of this Fig . 3 . Site - directed (cid:222)lament branching and actin - based mo - tility .

Several putative factors for nucleation , rap - id depolymerization , rapid barbed - end growth , or inhibition of nucleation in the cytoplasm are not required . Analysis of the movement at different concentrations of the individual components of the motil - ity medium elucidates the different facets of their function . At suboptimal concentra - tions of capping proteins , movement is slow , and the actin tails exhibit a fishbone pattern , demonstrating that branched fila - ments continue to grow away from the surface of the bacterium until a capping protein stops their growth ( 47 ) . The length and lifetime of the filaments in the actin meshwork , therefore , are controlled not only by ADF , but also by capping proteins , which restrict filament growth to the sites where force must be produced . These ob - servations reconcile two apparently op - posed models for actin - based motility , treadmilling , and nucleation - release ( 61 ) . Open Issues in the Mechanism of Actin - Based Motility The reconstitution of actin - based move - ment sets up the important issues that have to be solved concerning the concerted reg - ulation of motility by different signaling pathways , and the relations between the reactions of filament branching and growth at a surface and the resulting production of force . The minimum motility medium allows testing of the function of putative regulators of processes like phagocytosis , discovery of new activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , screening of inhibitors of motility , or devel - opment of a strategy for drug therapy design . The forthcoming challenges are to understand the interplay between microtubule dynamics and the actin response , mediated by small GTPases Rac and Rho ( 62 , 63 ) , and the cou - pling between protrusion and adhesion in motility . How general are the principles that gov - ern actin - based motility ? Remarkably , cell - cell adhesion appears mediated by directed actin polymerization ( 64 ) , showing that ac - tin partners involved in cell protrusion may be used in other directed processes . The importance of the regulation of the steady state of assembly may also apply to micro - tubules , the other dynamic fibers of the cytoskeleton . Most intriguing , the major sperm protein ( MSP ) – based crawling mo - tion of the nematode sperm ( 65 ) displays the same treadmilling behavior as actin , whereas MSP does not bind or hydrolyze ATP and assembles into a nonpolar poly - mer , virtually unable to treadmill or to support motor translocation . ATP nonethe - less is required for nematode motility . Whether a membrane - associated ATP - con - suming machinery energetically favors as - sembly at one end of the MSP fibers , close to the plasma membrane , thus inducing treadmilling in this symmetric polymer , is an open question . Biological engines are often thought to rectify brownian motion . Theoretical brownian ratchet models of actin - based motility first relied on the polymerization - biased diffusion of Listeria , then on the elastic properties of the actin filament ( 66 , 67 ) . Another model at the mesoscopic scale relies on the elastic properties of the actin meshwork and the shear stress due to the growth of the gel at the bacterium surface ( 68 , 69 ) . However , a microscopic model for force production is still pending . Progress requires deeper knowledge of the structure - function relation of the components of the membrane - bound motile machinery . High - resolution trajectory analysis of a bead ( 70 ) in a chemically controlled motility assay , microrheology of the transiently branched filament network will provide information on the molecular mechanism of movement . Single molecule measurements may be fea - sible in the future . References and Notes 1 . D . Bray , Cell Movements : From Molecules to Motility ( Garland , New York , ed . 2 , 2000 ) . 2 . T . J .
