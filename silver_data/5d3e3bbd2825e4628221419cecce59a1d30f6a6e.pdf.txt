An alternative splicing variant Rac1b is overexpressed in a subset of colorectal tumors and is required to sustain tumor cell viability . Thus , it is of therapeutic interest to understand the molecular mechanism behind the overexpression of Rac1b through alternative splicing . Here we describe that ASF / SF2 and SRp20 are two antagonistic splicing factors regulating Rac1b expression in colorectal tumor cells . Using an Rac1 minigene , we identiﬁed that SRp20 increased skipping of alternative exon 3b in HT29 colorectal cells , whereas ASF / SF2 increased its inclusion . The depletion of the endogenous expression of these splicing fac - tors by speciﬁc small interfering RNA conﬁrmed that ASF / SF2 acts as an enhancer of endogenous Rac1b splicing , whereas SRp20 acts as a silencer . Point mutations in exon 3b deﬁned two adjacent regulatory regions required for skipping or inclusion of exon 3b , which are recognized in vitro by SRp20 and ASF / SF2 , respectively . Both splicing factors were found to be regulated by upstream signaling pathways : the inhi - bition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase pathway increased protein levels of ASF / SF2 and promoted Rac1b , whereas activation of b - catenin / TCF4 increased expression of SRp20 and inhibited that of Rac1b . Together , these data reveal that signaling pathways act in concert to target independent splicing factors and achieve the correct combinatorial code to regulate alternative splicing of the small GTPase Rac1 . INTRODUCTION The expression of human genes involves their transcription into a pre - messenger RNA that is further processed to splice out introns and join exon sequences . It is now well documen - ted that the majority of human genes can produce more than one mature messenger RNA ( mRNA ) through alternative pat - terns of intron removal or exon skipping ( 1 – 3 ) . This allows the synthesis of multiple mRNAs from a single gene , and these transcripts can differ in mRNA stability and translation or encode protein variants with altered functional properties . In particular , alternative spliced exons frequently code for unstructured peptide regions and thus may modify the function or the regulation of a protein without affecting its structural integrity ( 4 ) . Hence , the process of alternative splicing increases the functional complexity of gene expression from a genome . At present , no simple structure / function prediction exists to provide evidence of biological relevance for a given alternative spliced variant , but many examples have been described of individual variants with novel protein properties ( e . g . reviewed in 5 – 7 ) . One striking example is alternative splicing of the small GTPase Rac1 , a member of the Rho family controlling signal - ing pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and gene transcription ( 8 , 9 ) . When in the active GTP - bound confor - mation , Rac1 interacts with downstream effector proteins and activates signaling cascades . In tumors , Rac1 activation is known to become deregulated ( 10 ) , and one recently unra - veled mechanism is through increased expression of alterna - tive spliced Rac1b in colorectal or breast tumor samples ( 11 , 12 ) . Rac1b differs in 57 nucleotides resulting from the in - frame inclusion of alternative exon 3b ( 13 ) . The resulting Rac1b protein adopts predominantly the active GTP - bound conformation in cells . This reﬂects altered regulatory proper - ties because of an increased intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity , a decreased rate of GTP hydrolysis and a failure to (cid:2) To whom correspondence should be addressed at : Centro de Gene´tica Humana , Instituto Nacional de Sau´de Dr Ricardo Jorge , Avenida Padre Cruz , 1649 - 016 Lisboa , Portugal .

Furthermore , the variant Rac1b displays unique signaling properties . It does not stimulate several classical Rac signaling pathways , including lamellipodia formation or the activation of protein kinases PAK1 or JNK . However , Rac1b retains the ability to stimulate the NF - kB pathway ( 18 , 19 ) , which initiates an anti - apoptotic transcriptional response and also promotes cell cycle progression by an increase in cyclin D1 expression ( 20 – 23 ) . These different functional properties are apparently selected for in some tumor cell types . For example , Rac1b promoted epithelial – mesenchymal transition of mouse mammary epi - thelial cells ( 17 ) and contributed to further activate Wnt sig - naling in HCT116 colorectal cells ( 24 ) . In addition , some colon tumors that carry the oncogenic B - Raf V600E mutation depend on increased Rac1b expression to sustain tumor cell survival ( 25 , 26 ) . However , the molecular details of how changes in alternative splicing lead to Rac1b overexpression remain unclear . Alternative splicing events can be modulated by changes in the protein levels of individual splicing factors . For example , the relative concentrations of SR proteins and hnRNP factors expressed in a given cell will affect splice site choices in those pre - mRNAs containing respective regulatory elements ( 27 – 29 ) . Altered expression of splicing factors was also described in various tumor types ( 30 – 32 ) . In addition , splicing factors can be regulated through post - translational modiﬁ - cation in response to cellular signaling pathways ( reviewed in 33 – 35 ) . For example , activation of the p38 - MAP kinase pathway led to phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 , resulting in its cytoplasmic sequestration and altered splicing of an adeno - virus reporter gene ( 36 ) . Also , phosphorylation of SRp40 by AKT2 has been shown to regulate alternative splicing of protein kinase C b II ( 37 , 38 ) , and the phosphatidylinositol 3 ( PI3 ) - kinase pathway mediates alternative splicing of ﬁbro - nectin in response to growth factor stimulation ( 39 ) . These examples provide a mechanistic framework for how alternative spliced variants can be generated in response to signaling pathways ; however , our limited understanding about these events derives from a careful analysis of candidate gene examples . In this manuscript , we present a further concept for the signaling – splicing connection in which the combination of two oncogenic signaling pathways acts on antagonistic SR proteins . We dissected the molecular regu - lation of Rac1 alternative splicing in colorectal cancer cells and found that ASF / SF2 and SRp20 exhibit antagonistic effects on alternative spliced exon 3b , in the context of both a minigene and the endogenous transcript . The data lead us to propose a model for the genetic tumor context in which overexpression of Rac1b can be selected for to promote colon tumorigenesis . RESULTS An Rac1 minigene approach identiﬁes candidate regulatory splicing factors Previously , we reported that the mammalian RAC1 gene con - tains seven coding exons ( Fig . 1A ) , which give rise to two alternative transcripts , Rac1 and Rac1b ( 11 , 13 ) . Typically , exon 3b is skipped , and Rac1 is the predominant transcript produced . However , exon 3b - containing variant Rac1b has been found overexpressed in a subset of colorectal tumors and this promoted tumor cell survival ( 26 ) . In order to study the molecular regulation of this splicing event in tumor cells , we ﬁrst selected colorectal cell lines with different levels of Rac1 and Rac1b expression . As shown in Figure 1B , SW480 cells express only Rac1 transcript and protein , whereas DLD - 1 and HT29 cells express Rac1 as well as different levels of the alternative Rac1b transcript and protein . In these cell lines , we also compared the activated GTP - loaded Rac1 and Rac1b protein pools using a PAK - CRIB domain pull - down assay . In HT29 cells , a predominant acti - vation of Rac1b over Rac1 was observed , although quantiﬁ - cation of Rac1b transcripts by real - time PCR indicated that only (cid:2) 10 % of the Rac1 pre - mRNA was spliced into Rac1b transcripts ( not shown ) . Thus , the structural differences result - ing from exon 3b inclusion lead to hyperactivation of Rac1b , and this is in agreement with previously published data ( 14 – 17 ) . These results demonstrate that small changes in alternative Rac1 splicing are sufﬁcient to generate Rac1b protein levels that have a profound effect on the activated , GTP - loaded Rac1 pool in colorectal cells . In order to determine how the alternative splicing event of the RAC1 pre - mRNA is controlled , we ﬁrst checked for the presence of genomic mutations in the three cell lines . A genomic RAC1 fragment ranging from 286 bp upstream to 224 bp downstream of exon 3b was ampliﬁed and sequenced . The three fragments were wild - type without any mutation that could account for the observed splicing differences . To study Figure 1 .

( A ) Schematic representation of the human RAC1 gene with its seven coding exons , including the alternative exon 3b , and of the two alternative transcripts Rac1 and Rac1b . ( B ) Expression analysis of endogenous Rac1b in three colorectal cell lines . Rac1b was detected either by RT – PCR ( top panel ) or by western blot analysis using an anti - Rac1 antibody ( middle ) . A CRIB - domain pull - down assay followed by western blot ( bottom ) demon - strates the amount of active GTP - bound Rac1 and Rac1b in the indicated cell lines . Note that Rac1b protein is expressed in low amounts compared with Rac1 but adopts predominantly the active GTP - bound conformation . Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 3697 how this splicing event is regulated , we constructed a mini - gene and cloned the genomic region between exon 3 and exon 4 of the RAC1 gene into a pcDNA3 vector backbone ( Fig . 2A ) . The minigene was transfected into SW480 and HT29 cells , and the minigene - derived transcripts were found to recapitulate the endogenous Rac1 and Rac1b expression patterns of these cell lines ( Fig . 2A ) . With this RAC1 minigene tool , we analyzed the effect of a panel of known splicing factors on exon 3b inclusion . HT29 cells were co - transfected with the minigene , and the indicated factors and transcript ratios were quantiﬁed by real - time PCR ( Fig . 2B ) . We found that overexpression of two splicing factors had the most signiﬁcant effect : SRp20 led to strong exon 3b skipping , whereas ASF / SF2 promoted inclusion of exon 3b by over 2 - fold . We then asked whether SRp20 and ASF / SF2 affected the RAC1 exon 3b speciﬁcally and found that both factors exhibited different effects on alternative skipped exons in the PTB - derived minigene pG11 ( 40 ) or the FAS minigene ( 41 ) ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S1 ) . We concluded that ASF / SF2 and SRp20 were two candidate splicing factors regulating alternative splicing of Rac1 exon 3b . Depletion of ASF / SF2 or SRp20 affects endogenous Rac1 / Rac1b splicing ratios In order to test the relevance of the observed splicing effects for endogenous Rac1b levels , we ﬁrst established the exper - imental conditions to deplete expression of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 using small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) oligonucleotides . Transfection of the siRNAs indicated in Figure 3A into HT29 cells led to efﬁcient depletion by . 80 % for each factor . In these tests , the depletion of SRp55 served as a negative control and that of 9G8 was included , because it shares some binding motifs with SRp20 ( 42 , 43 ) . Under the described experimental conditions , the relative changes in endogenous Rac1b expression were quantiﬁed by real - time PCR in HT29 cells following the depletion of each of the four splicing factors ( Fig . 3B ) . The depletion of ASF / SF2 strongly inhibited endogenous Rac1b generation . In contrast , the suppression of SRp20 and 9G8 increased endogenous Rac1b compared with cells transfected with control or SRp55 - speciﬁc siRNAs . The opposite effects were observed when these four splicing factors were overexpressed in HT29 cells , although transfec - tion was less than with siRNAs . In particular , overexpression of ASF / SF2 promoted , whereas SRp20 and 9G8 inhibited , the generation of endogenous Rac1b compared with control or SRp55 - transfected cells . These data conﬁrm the results obtained in the minigene approach and substantiate the identi - ﬁcation of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 as candidate regulators of Rac1 alternative splicing . We next asked whether the relative expression of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 in the colorectal cell lines would correlate with the level of endogenous Rac1b . When compared with SW480 cells , which do not express endogenous Rac1b , we found that HT29 cells clearly expressed more ASF / SF2 and less SRp20 , both at transcript and protein levels by RT – PCR or western blot , respectively ( Fig . 3C ) . We therefore reasoned that the experimental manipulation of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 levels in SW480 cells should provoke increased expression of Rac1b . We observed that overexpression of ASF / SF2 in SW480 cells led to some increase in Rac1b and this could further be raised upon simultaneous depletion of SRp20 , now reaching Rac1b levels normally detected in DLD - 1 cells ( Fig . 3D ) . These results provide a proof of principle that ASF / SF2 acts as an enhancer for exon 3b inclusion , whereas SRp20 is a silencer promoting exon 3b skipping . Figure 2 .

The panels below compare the RT – PCR ampliﬁcation of endogenous Rac1 and Rac1b in HT29 and SW480 cells ( left ) with the transcripts derived from the RAC1 minigene after its transfection into these two cell lines . ( B ) Effect of co - transfected candidate splicing factors on RAC1 minigene alternative spli - cing in HT29 cells . Transfection of the indicated splicing factors as well as of the negative control TBP was detected by western blot using anti - tag anti - bodies ( bottom panel ) . Minigene - derived transcripts were either ampliﬁed by RT – PCR and stained following gel electrophoresis ( middle ) or quantiﬁed by real - time PCR ( top graph ) and displayed on a logarithmic scale for pro - portional visualization of positive and negative changes . 3698 Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 The Rac1 exon 3b sequence contains binding sites for ASF / SF2 and SRp20 The observed effects of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 on alternative spli - cing of Rac1b suggested that these factors could bind directly to exon 3b in the Rac1 pre - mRNA . For the identiﬁcation of such binding sites , we ﬁrst aligned exon 3b sequences from various species and identiﬁed conserved nucleotide positions ( Fig . 4A ) . A series of conserved or control nucleotides were then mutated in the RAC1 minigene ( Fig . 4B ) , and the resulting constructs transfected into HT29 cells ( Fig . 4C ) . Mutant minigene - derived transcripts were ampliﬁed by RT – PCR and the ratios of exon 3b - containing transcripts quantiﬁed . This sys - tematic analysis identiﬁed that nucleotide changes at exon pos - itions þ 7 and þ 11 strongly inhibited exon 3b inclusion ( exonic mutants E1 . 0 and E1 . 2 ) , whereas changes at positions þ 18 and þ 19 promoted constitutive inclusion of exon 3b ( mutants E2 . 0 and E2 . 1 ) ( Fig . 4C ) . Together , these data indicated that exon 3b contains an exonic splice enhancer element followed by a silen - cer element . From the experiments described earlier , we postu - lated that these elements would be recognized by ASF / SF2 and SRp20 , respectively . We further evaluated the exon 3b sequence and its mutants using bioinformatic software to recognize exonic splicing regu - latory elements . The ESEﬁnder program ( 44 ; available at http : / / rulai . cshl . edu / cgi - bin / tools / ESE3 / eseﬁnder . cgi ? process = home ) as well as the Splicing Rainbow software ( 45 ; available at http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / asd - srv / wb . cgi ? method = 8 ) predicted that mutants E1 . 0 and E1 . 2 would interrupt an ASF / SF2 - binding site , and the Fairbrother and Wang algorithm at the ESR search ( 46 ; available at http : / / ast . bioinfo . tau . ac . il / ESR . htm ) Figure 3 .

Note that ASF / SF2 depletion inhibited the generation of endogenous Rac1b , whereas SRp20 depletion promoted it . ( C ) Comparison of the endogenous expression levels of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 in HT29 and SW480 cells . Note that , in HT29 cells , the expression of endogenous Rac1b correlates with increased ASF / SF2 and decreased SRp20 transcript and protein levels when compared with SW480 cells . Detection of a - tubulin served as loading control . ( D ) Experimental manipulation of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 levels can force SW480 cells to include exon 3b . The western blot ( lower panel ) documents the ASF / SF2 and SRp20 levels under the three different experimental conditions ( control vector , or T7 - tagged ASF / SF2 , or T7 - tagged ASF / SF2 combined with siSRp20 oligos ) , whereas the black bars in the graph represent the corresponding minigene - derived transcript analyses ( top panel ) . Note the progressive increase in exon 3b - containing transcripts upon overexpression of enhancer ASF / SF2 and the depletion of silencer SR20 , approximating splicing ratios to that normally observed in untransfected DLD - 1 cells ( gray bars ) . Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 3699 predicted generically the loss of an exonic splice enhancer . With regard to positions þ 18 and þ 19 of exon 3b , the algor - ithms from the C . Burge Laboratory ( Fairbrother and Wang ( 46 ) as well as the FAS - ESS ( 47 ) ; available at http : / / genes . mit . edu / fas - ess / ) identiﬁed a putative exonic splice silencer at this position , which became interrupted by mutants E2 . 0 and E2 . 1 . A similar mutational approach was applied to conserved nucleotides near the 5 0 end of the downstream intron 3b ; however , no signiﬁcant changes in exon 3b inclusion were observed ( data not shown ) .

( Right ) Autoradiographs showing mobility shifts of the indicated probes in the presence of 50 or 150 ng recombinant ASF / SF2 . Note the clear loss of afﬁnity of ASF / SF2 to the mutant probe E1 . 0 . 3700 Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 For direct experimental demonstration that ASF / SF2 binds the predicted motif around nucleotides þ 7 and þ 11 , the wild - type exon 3b sequence as well as mutant E1 . 0 and E2 . 0 sequences were in vitro - transcribed and radiolabeled , then incubated in the presence of recombinant ASF / SF2 and ana - lyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) . We found that increasing amounts of recombinant ASF / SF2 led to a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility of the wild - type and the E2 . 0 probe , and this shift was abolished by excess unlabelled probe ( Fig . 4D ) . In contrast , mutant probe E1 . 0 revealed a strongly reduced afﬁnity for ASF / SF2 , conﬁrming the bioinformatic predictions . Because in eukaryotic cells splicing factors can be post - translationally modiﬁed and differ from recombinant protein in binding afﬁnity or subcellular localization , we wished to conﬁrm the EMSA data with nuclear extracts . ASF / SF2 and SRp20 were overexpressed in DLD - 1 cells , and nuclear pro - teins extracted and incubated with the radiolabeled exon 3b and mutant probes . Conﬁrming the result with recombinant protein , we observed that the presence of increasing ASF / SF2 - containing nuclear extracts caused a mobility shift of wild - type exon 3b and mutant E2 . 0 probes ( Fig . 5A ) . The shifted complex was diminished by adding an excess unlabelled probe and was super - shifted in the presence of an ASF / SF2 antibody , but not a control antibody . As observed before , mutant E1 . 0 with a disrupted ASF / SF2 recognition motif was hardly recognized by nuclear extracts and no clear super - shift was observed ( Fig . 5A ) . When the same set of experiments was repeated with nuclear extracts expressing SRp20 , we obtained a comparable mobility shift of wild - type exon 3b , but now mutant probe E1 . 0 exhibited the shift , whereas probe E2 . 0 was inefﬁciently recognized ( Fig . 5B ) . The exon 3b and mutant probes were also incubated with a recombinant N - terminal SRp20 fragment ; however , this fragment apparently did not bind to RNA ( not shown ) . The EMSA data revealed that point mutations E1 . 0 and E2 . 0 signiﬁcantly decreased the binding afﬁnities for Figure 5 . EMSA with nuclear extracts from colorectal cells . ( A ) Nuclear extracts were prepared from DLD - 1 cells transfected with ASF / SF2 , then 0 . 5 or 1 m g incubated with the indicated probes and complexes separated in non - denaturing acrylamide gels . To verify the speciﬁcity of the observed com - plexes , additional aliquots were incubated with an excess of unlabeled probe , or with an anti - ASF / SF2 antibody or a control antibody . Note the super - shifted bands ( arrow heads ) in the presence of anti - ASF / SF2 , and also that mutant probe E1 . 0 has a strongly reduced afﬁnity to ASF / SF2 . ( B ) As described for ( A ) except that nuclear extracts were prepared from DLD - 1 cells transfected with SRp20 . Note the super - shifted bands ( arrow heads ) in the presence of anti - SRp20 , and that mutant probe E2 . 0 has a strongly reduced afﬁnity to SRp20 . ( C ) Restoration of normal splicing patterns from mutants E1 . 0 and E2 . 0 . The signiﬁcantly reduced binding afﬁnities of ASF / SF2 to mutant probe E1 . 0 as well as of SRp20 to probe E2 . 0 were compensated by co - expressing the respective mutant minigenes with the corresponding ASF / SF2 or SRp20 constructs into HT29 cells . The western blot ( lower panel ) shows increasing expression levels of ASF / SF2 or SRp20 levels . Under these conditions , minigene - derived transcripts were ampliﬁed by RT – PCR and stained following gel electrophoresis ( middle ) . Relative band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis and displayed on a logarithmic scale for proportional visualization of positive and negative changes ( top graph ) . Note that overexpression of these factors restored exon 3b inclusion almost to wild - type levels . Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 3701 ASF / SF2 or SRp20 , respectively , but did not fully ablate protein binding . We therefore assumed that overexpression of ASF / SF2 should be able to compensate the reduction in afﬁ - nity towards the exon 3b mutant E1 . 0 , and overexpression of SRp20 should compensate mutant E2 . 0 . We tested this by co - transfecting the mutant minigenes E1 . 0 and E2 . 0 with increasing amounts of either ASF / SF2 or SRp20 and analyzed the minigene - derived transcripts . As shown in Figure 5C , increasing amounts of ASF / SF2 partially restored exon 3b inclusion from mutant E1 . 0 , and overexpression of SRp20 restored skipping of exon 3b from mutant E2 . 0 to near - wild - type minigene levels . We further excluded that the minigene mutants created binding sites for the respective antagonistic splicing factor . In particular , skipping of exon 3b due to minigene mutation E1 . 0 could be caused by increased binding of SRp20 ; however , the knock down of SRp20 in HT29 cells did not abrogate exon 3b skipping from this mutant . Conversely , the preferential inclusion of exon 3b in mutant E2 . 0 could reﬂect an increased afﬁnity for ASF / SF2 rather than impaired SRp20 binding ; however , siRNA - mediated downregulation of ASF / SF2 expression only partially decreased the inclusion of exon 3b from this mutant ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S2 ) . Together , these data suggest that alternative spliced exon 3b contains neighboring positive and negative splicing regulatory elements that are recognized by splicing factor complexes containing either ASF / SF2 or SRp20 , respectively . PI3 - kinase and b - catenin signaling pathways affect Rac1b expression Our data so far identiﬁed ASF / SF2 and SRp20 as key splicing factors regulating Rac1b expression in colorectal cells . Because Rac1b is overexpressed in a group of colorectal tumors , we asked which upstream oncogenic signaling path - ways would act on these SR proteins and trigger the Rac1 exon 3b splicing event . One hallmark oncogenic pathway activated in many color - ectal tumors is Wnt signaling , which recruits cytosolic b - catenin as a transcriptional co - activator ( 48 ) . Very recently , we found that the SFSR3 gene encoding SRp20 is a transcrip - tional target for activated b - catenin / TCF4 complexes , leading to increased SRp20 protein levels ( 49 ) . We therefore tested in colorectal cells the expression of Rac1b following either pathway stimulation with an activated b - catenin mutant or pathway inhibition with a dominant negative TCF4 mutant . Endogenous Rac1b levels were found to clearly respond to b - catenin / TCF4 - induced changes in SRp20 protein levels . In particular , we observed that the inhibition of Wnt signaling decreased SRp20 and increased Rac1b levels ( Fig . 6A ) . This is in agreement with the data in Figures 3B and 5B that revealed SRp20 as a silencer of exon 3b inclusion . This ﬁnding suggested that tumors with low Wnt pathway acti - vation are permissive to overexpression of Rac1b . Furthermore , we suspected the existence of signals that can directly promote Rac1b overexpression via ASF / SF2 . We tested the effect of three MAP kinase and the PI3 - kinase path - ways . The inhibition of ERK , JNK or p38 MAP kinase activi - ties by the respective speciﬁc inhibitors U0126 , SP600125 or SB203580 had no signiﬁcant effect on endogenous Rac1b levels within 24 h ( Fig . 6B ; data not shown ) . Similarly , no effect was observed following transfection of kinase - dead JNK or p38 mutants ( Fig . 6B ; data not shown ) . In contrast , interfering with the PI3 - kinase signaling by cell treatment with 10 m M inhibitor LY294002 revealed a 1 . 5 - fold increase in Rac1b within 24 h . Similarly , overexpression of the counter - acting phosphatase PTEN or of a kinase - dead mutant of the downstream effector kinase AKT signiﬁcantly induced Rac1b expression within 24 h . Under the same experimental con - ditions , we found that PI3 - kinase inhibition ( by LY294002 treat - ment or following overexpression of PTEN ) led to increased expression of endogenous ASF / SF2 , at both the transcript and the protein levels ( Fig . 6B ) . In control experiments , these conditions of PI3 - kinase inhibition did not affect endogenous expression of another splicing factor , hnRNP A1 ( data not shown ) . We observed no change in ASF / SF2 expression when the p38 MAP kinase activity was inhibited ( Fig . 6B ) . Together , these data provide evidence that the PI3 - kinase and b - catenin signaling pathways affect the expression of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 , respectively , and consequently modify the generation of Rac1b . DISCUSSION A major contribution of the present work is the demonstration that different cellular signaling pathways act in concert to regulate a speciﬁc alternative splicing event . By synchronizing the expression of two SR proteins with antagonistic roles , the pathways regulate inclusion or skipping of an alternative exon . The example studied is alternative splicing of exon 3b of the signaling small GTPase Rac1 . Experimental data from cell lines and normal tissues have revealed that exon 3b is usually either skipped or included into only a small transcript fraction ( 11 , 17 ) . It has typical fea - tures of alternative exons such as its small size of 57 bp and a poorly conserved polypyrimidine tract . The polypyrimidine tract is an important splicing regulatory element at the splice acceptor site , and its length usually correlates with the efﬁ - ciency of exon inclusion . Calculating the consensus values ( CVs ) that reﬂect the ‘strength’ of a polypyrimidine signal ( 50 ; online tool at http : / / ast . bioinfo . tau . ac . il / SpliceSiteFrame . htm ) , a weak tract becomes evident for exon 3b ( CV ¼ 75 . 08 ) when compared with the CVs of the surrounding exons 3 ( 83 . 41 ) and 4 ( 92 . 25 ) . In agreement , we observed that single - point mutations , which strengthen the exon 3b polypyrimidine tract in the RAC1 minigene , were sufﬁcient to promote nearly constitutive inclusion of exon 3b ( data not shown ) . These data and the absence of genomic mutations in the analyzed cell lines suggested that differences in Rac1b expression are based on a regulated alternative splicing event . In this work , we demonstrate that Rac1 alternative splicing is regulated by the SR proteins ASF / SF2 and SRp20 in color - ectal cells . In order to dissect the mechanisms regulating the alternative Rac1b splicing event , we ﬁrst constructed an RAC1 minigene that recapitulates the endogenous splicing decisions in colon cell lines . We then tested a panel of candi - date splicing factors for their effect on the minigene and were fortunate to identify one Rac1b promoting and another silen - 3702 Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 cing factor . Their physiological roles in Rac1 alternative spli - cing in colorectal tumor cells were then conﬁrmed at the endogenous level by RNA interference experiments . More - over , these factors recognized probes transcribed in vitro from exon 3b . Altogether , our data lead us to propose that exon 3b contains an exonic splice enhancer recognized by ASF / SF2 adjacent to an exonic silencer bound by SRp20 . In our experimental system of colorectal cell lines , we observed that the relative protein concentrations of ASF / SF2 versus SRp20 determined the alternative splicing rate . Not only did the endogenous protein levels of both factors correlate with the amount of Rac1b expressed in different cell lines , but also the experimental manipulation of ASF / SF2 and SRp20 expression levels by RNAi or splicing factor overexpression changed alternative splicing of exon 3b . As upstream events regulating the relative protein concen - trations of ASF / SF2 versus SRp20 , we identiﬁed two signaling pathways that affected their expression and promoted a corre - sponding increase or decrease in Rac1b . The Wnt pathway acti - vates the b - catenin / TCF4 transcriptional complex , for which the SFSR3 gene encoding SRp20 is a direct target ( 49 ) . Pathway stimulation increased SRp20 levels that we found to act as a silencer on exon 3b , leading to decreased Rac1b gener - ation . The PI3 - kinase pathway was found involved in regulating the antagonistic factor ASF / SF2 . The inhibition of this pathway increased expression of both the transcript and protein levels of ASF / SF2 , which acts as an enhancer of exon 3b inclusion . Con - sequently , an increased Rac1b expression was observed . Together , this shows that different signaling pathways concur - rently target independent splicing factors in order to exert control over alternative splicing of Rac1b . Numerous studies have documented that the relative abun - dance of antagonistic splicing factors , including ASF / SF2 and SRp20 , can affect splicing decisions ( e . g . 51 – 53 ) . It is therefore well accepted that splicing factor expression levels are a major mechanism to trigger differences in alternative splicing patterns . According to current knowledge , antagon - istic splicing factors regulate alternative splicing through a combinatorial mode of action with a subset of individual genes responding to a given factor combination or activation ( 28 , 29 ) . The novelty of our ﬁndings resides in the demon - stration that a concerted signaling level of apparently indepen - dent pathways is essential to promote a speciﬁc alternative splicing event . This adds further complexity to the regulation Figure 6 . Different signaling pathways act in concert to modulate Rac1b expression . ( A ) Effect of b - catenin / TCF4 transcriptional activity on alternative splicing of Rac1b . HT29 cells were transfected as indicated with either empty pEGFP vector , or a dominant - negative GFP - TCF4 mutant ( TCF - DN ) , or a non - degradable GFP - b - catenin mutant ( b Cat - CA ) . The expression of Rac1b was quantiﬁed by real - time PCR ( top panel ) . The western blots below the graph show the indicated expression levels of the transfected GFP - tagged constructs , the resulting changes in endogenous SRp20 protein levels and , as controls , the levels of ASF / SF2 and a - tubulin . Note that pathway activation by transfection of b Cat - CA promoted an increase in SRp20 but a decrease in Rac1b expression . ( B ) Effect of PI3 - kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathway inhibition on alternative splicing of Rac1b . HT29 cells were treated with inhibitors LY294002 ( 10 m M ) or SB203580 ( 1 m M ) , or transfected with constructs encoding control vector , or PTEN , or kinase - dead mutants of either AKT or p38 . RNA was extracted after 24 h , endogenous Rac1b quantiﬁed by real - time PCR and data graphically displayed . ( C ) Effect of PI3 - kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathway inhibition on ASF / SF2 expression levels . Cells were treated as described earlier and whole - cell lysates analyzed for changes in ASF / SF2 transcript ( by real - time PCR ; top ) and protein levels ( by western blot , using tubulin levels as loading control ; bottom ) . Note that , in the presence of the PI3 inhibitor or upon overexpression of PTEN , an increase in ASF / SF2 was observed that correlated with increased Rac1b expression . Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 3703 of alternative splicing and implies that certain splice site choices require a balanced stimulation of multiple pathways . It is possible that Rac1b alternative splicing is further modu - lated through protein phosphorylation of ASF / SF2 or SRp20 . For example , our observation is suggestive that overexpression of PTEN promoted an increase in ASF / SF2 expression , whereas that of a kinase - dead AKT mutant did not . However , the kinase - dead AKT mutant still induced some increase in Rac1b , although less pronounced than following PTEN expression . This suggests that post - translational modiﬁ - cation of ASF / SF2 also contributes to the regulation of exon 3b inclusion . Indeed , nuclear and cytoplasmic functions for ASF / SF2 are known to be modulated by phosphorylation ( 54 , 55 ) and AKT has been recently described to phosphorylate ASF / SF2 in vitro ( 56 ) . The inhibition of PI3 - kinase pathway has previously been implicated in the regulation of other alternative splicing events such as of the ﬁbronectin and PKC b II genes ( 39 , 57 , 58 ) , but mechanistic details remained uncharacterized . Further experiments will be required to clarify whether and how the PI3 - kinase pathway affects ASF / SF2 expression at the transcriptional or the post - transcriptional level , and what role of phosphorylation by one of the AKT kinases is playing . It is possible that the PI3 - kinase pathway regulates other SR protein regulators besides AKT , such as the SRPK and Clk / Sty family of protein kinases . These operate in the cytosol ( 59 ) and may antagonize the effect of AKT on SR proteins ( 56 ) . Our observation that PI3 - kinase signaling inhibited expression of Rac1b ( Fig . 6B ) helps to clarify genetic path - ways leading to colorectal tumorigenesis . One group of tumors show oncogenic KRAS mutations and these increase cell proliferation via ERK signaling and provide pro - survival stimuli via the PI3 kinase / Rac1 pathway ( 60 ) . This group is represented by SW480 cells , which do not express endogenous Rac1b ( Fig . 3C ) , and this is compatible with mutant K - Ras strongly activating PI3 - kinase , thus leading to decreased ASF / SF2 expression . Similarly , HCT116 colorectal cells carry an H1047R mutation in the PIK3CA gene and do not express Rac1b . In contrast , HT29 cells have wild - type KRAS and PIK3CA genes but carry the alternative oncogenic BRAF mutation ( 26 ) . B - Raf operates downstream of K - Ras in the ERK pathway and thus cannot stimulate PI3 - kinase directly . In agreement , HT29 cells express more ASF / SF2 and more Rac1b . HT29 cells represent another group of colorectal tumors in which the oncogenic B - Raf V600E mutation occurs associated with overexpressed Rac1b ( 26 ) . Whereas B - Raf V600E primarily stimulates cell proliferation , Rac1b sig - naling sustains tumor cell survival ( 26 ) . However , the molecu - lar details of how Rac1b becomes overexpressed remained unclear . The data presented in this manuscript now allow us to propose a mechanism for Rac1b overexpression : genetic lesions that initiate colorectal tumorigenesis without enhan - cing PI3 - kinase and b - catenin signaling promote the selection of cellular backgrounds with increased ASF / SF2 levels rela - tive to SRp20 . These cellular settings would favor Rac1b over - expression , leading to increased tumor cell survival and subsequent tumor progression . In conclusion , cellular signals are known to inﬂuence the outcome of alternative splicing , but most knowledge in this ﬁeld has provided evidence for a ‘one signaling pathway , one gene’ - type of regulation . In this article , we revealed that different signaling pathways need to act in concert so that the targeting of independent splicing factors can provide the correct combinatorial code to regulate alternative splicing of the small GTPase Rac1 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfection DLD - 1 and SW480 colorectal cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( Invitrogen ) , whereas HT29 cells were grown in RPMI . Cell lines were regularly checked for the absence of mycoplasm infection . Cells were grown in 35 mm dishes to 60 – 80 % con - ﬂuence , transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions , and analyzed 16 – 24 h later . Total amounts of transfected DNA were 2 m g of DNA per dish for DLD - 1 and SW480 cells or 4 m g for HT29 cells . If required , the amount of DNA was adjusted with empty vector . Plasmid transfection efﬁciencies were judged microscopically by expression of 2 m g of GFP and reached 60 – 80 % in DLD - 1 and SW480 cells or 40 – 60 % in HT29 cells . For RNA interference experiments , HT29 cells at 30 – 40 % conﬂuence were transfected in 35 mm dishes with 400 pmol of the indicated siRNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 and analyzed after 48 h . The siRNA oligos were ordered from MWG Biotech ( Ebersberg , Germany ) with the following sequences : control siGFP : 5 0 - GGC UAC GUC CAG GAG CGC ACC TT ; siSRp55A : 5 0 - GCA GAU CUA AGG AUG AGU A ; siSRp55B : 5 0 - GCA GGU GAA GUA ACC UAU G ; siSRp20A : 5 0 - GAG UGG AAC UGU CGA AUG G ; siSRp20B : 5 0 - GAG CUA GAU GGA AGA ACA C ; siSF2A : 5 0 - AGA AGA UAU GAC CUA UGC A ; siSF2B : 5 0 - GCA GGU GAU GUA UGU UAU G ; si9G8A : 5 0 - AGA UCA AGA UCC AGG UCU A ; si9G8B : 5 0 - ACA CUC CAU GUA GCU AAU A . For the inhibition of signaling pathways , cells were treated for 24 h with 2 m M U0126 , 1 m M SB203580 or 10 m M LY294002 ( all from Sigma and dissolved in DMSO ) . DNA constructs The following previously published constructs were used : HA - tagged TATA - binding protein ( TBP ) ( 11 ) ; HA - tagged U2AF65 ( 61 ) , and U2AF35 ( 62 ) ; Myc - tagged hnRNPA1 ( 63 ) ; T7 - tagged constructs of SC35 , SRp55 , SRp40 , SRp30 , SRp20 , ASF / SF2 and 9G8 ( 64 ) ; dominant negative TCF - 4 ( TCF - DN ) and constitutively active b - catenin ( b - Cat - CA ) ( 49 ) ; pCMV - PTEN ( 65 ) ; kinase - dead AKT mutant HA - PKB - K179A ( 66 ; recloned as a Bgl III / Eco RI fragment into pEGFP ) ; kinase - dead Flag - p38 mutant K53M ( 67 ) ; Myc - JNK ( 68 ; recloned as Bam HI / Xba I fragment from pRev - TRE SAPKbeta / MKK7 fol - lowing site - directed mutagenesis into kinase - dead mutant K56R / K57R ) ; splicing reporter minigenes PTB - pG11 ( 40 ) and FAS ( 41 ) . All constructs were conﬁrmed by automated DNA sequencing . For the RAC1 minigene construct , a previously described 4 . 3 kb fragment containing intron 3 and the adjacent ends of exons 3 and 3b ( 13 ) was ﬁrst subcloned into pCR - XL - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . Exon 3 was then complemented by exchanging a Bam HI / Bsm I fragment ampliﬁed from BAC clone 3704 Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 RP11 - 425P05 with primers RACBAMEX3 - F ( 5 0 - GGA TCC TTT GAC AAT TAT ACT TCT GCC AAT G ) and RACINT3 - BSMR ( 5 0 - CAG ACA CTG GTA TCT GAG CAT CTG T ) . Intron 3b and exon 4 were added to this construct as an Nsi I fragment ampliﬁed from BAC clone RP11 - 425P05 with primers Not - Int3 - F ( 5 0 - GCG GCC GCC GAT AAG AGG TTA TAT TGA ) and RACEX4NOT - R ( 5 0 - GCG GCC GCT TTG CAC GGA CAT TTT CAA ATG ) . The assembled genomic region between exon 3 and exon 4 of the human RAC1 gene was then cloned as a Bam HI / Not I fragment into a pcDNA3 - HA vector to generate the RAC1 minigene . Conserved nucleotides in exon 3b of RAC1 minigene were mutated using the QuickChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) fol - lowing the manufacturer’s instructions . Nucleic acid ampliﬁcations , semi - quantitative and real - time RT – PCR Genomic DNA was extracted from SW480 , DLD - 1 and HT29 cells using the Wizard DNA Extraction Kit ( Promega ) , and an RAC1 gene fragment encompassing 286 bp upstream and 224 bp downstream of exon 3b was ampliﬁed with primers Int3KSP - F1 ( 5 0 - GCG GCC GCT TAC CCA CCG GCT TGA ATT A ) and RacInt3b - R2 ( 5 0 - GCT GCC TGT CAC AGC TCC CA ) . Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates with the RNAeasy kit ( Qiagen ) and 1 m g reverse - transcribed using random primers ( Invitrogen ) and Ready - to - Go You - Prime Beads ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) . Transcript expression was analyzed by RT – PCR with the following speciﬁc primers : for endogenous Rac1 / Rac1b : Ex3F ( 5 0 - GGA TCC TTT GAC AAT TAT TCT GCC AAT G ) and Ex4R ( 5 0 - CGG ACA TTT TCA AAT GAT GCA GG ) ; for RAC1 minigene transcripts : HABamF ( 5 0 - CAT GAT CGA CTA CGA CGT TCC TGA TTA TGC GG ) combined with either reverse primer Jun3 / 4R ( 5 0 - ACA AGC AAA TTG AGA ACA CAT CTG TT ) for exon 3 þ 4 transcripts , or Ex3bR ( 5 0 - ATA TCC TTA CCG TAC GTT TCT CCA A ) for exon 3 þ 3b þ 4 transcripts , or Ex4NotR ( 5 0 - GCG GCC GCT TTG CAC GGA CAT TTT CAA ATG ) for both tran - scripts ; for PTB - derived pG11 minigene : pG - F ( 5 0 - GGC AAA GAA TTC GCC ACC A ) and FP - R ( 5 0 - GAA CTT CAG GGT CAG CTT GC ) ; for FAS minigene : PT1 ( 5 0 - GTC GAC GAC ACT TGC TCA AC ) and PT2 ( 5 0 - AAG CTT GCA TCG AAT CAG TAG ) ; for 9G8 : 9G8F ( 5 0 - TGC AGT ACG AGG ACT GGA TG ) and 9G8R ( 5 0 - CCG TGA CCT GCT TCT TCT TC ) ; for ASF / SF2 : ASF / SF2F ( 5 0 - GCG ACG GCT ATG ATT ACG AT ) and ASF / SF2R ( 5 0 - ATC CTG CCA ACT TCC ACT TG ) ; for SRp20 : SRp20 - F ( 5 0 - AAC AAG ACG GAA TTG GAA CG ) and SRp20 - R ( 5 0 - TGG GCC ACG ATT TCT ACT TC ) ; and for RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) : Pol II - F ( 5 0 - GAG CGG GAA TTT GAG CGG ATG C ) and Pol II - R ( 5 0 - GAA GGC GTG GGT TGA TGT GGA AGA ) . Ampliﬁcation reactions were performed using AmpliTaq polymerase ( Perkin - Elmer , Wellesley , MA , USA ) at 60 8 C for 30 cycles for endogenous Rac1 / Rac1b , minigene ( RAC1 , pG11 or FAS ) - derived tran - scripts , 9G8 , ASF / SF2 and SRp20 , and at 66 8 C for 28 cycles for Pol II . All reactions included an initial denaturation of 5 min at 94 8 C and a ﬁnal extension of 10 min at 72 8 C , and each cycle contained 30 s of denaturation and extension . Semi - quantitative analyses of transcript levels were established using serial dilutions of control cDNAs in order to determine the linear ampliﬁcation phase for each PCR reaction . Products were separated on 2 % agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide , images recorded digitally and band intensity quanti - ﬁed using ImageJ software followed by normalization to Pol II expression levels . Real - time PCR quantiﬁcation was per - formed on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System . Primers were designed using the ABI Primer Express software that ampliﬁed amplicons speciﬁc for endogenous Rac1b ( 78 bp ) ( 5 0 - GGG CAA AGA CAA GCC GAT TG and 5 0 - CGG ACA TTT TCA AAT GAT GCA GG ) or total Rac1 transcripts ( i . e . Rac1 þ Rac1b ; 75 bp ) ( 5 0 - CCT GCA TCA TTT GAA AAT GTC CG and 5 0 - CCC ACT AGG ATG ATG GGA GTG T ) as well as for RAC1 minigene transcript ex3 þ 3b þ 4 ( 5 0 - CAT GAT CGA CTA CGA CGT TCC TGA TTA TGC GG and 5 0 - ATA TCC TTA CCG TAC GTT TCT CCA A ) or minigene transcript ex3 þ 4 ( 5 0 - CAT GAT CGA CTA CGA CGT TCC TGA TTA TGC GG and 5 0 - ACA AGC AAA TTG AGA ACA CAT CTG TT ) . Each cDNA sample was diluted 5 - fold to guarantee accurate pipetting and 5 m l added to 300 nmol / l primers and SYBR Green Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . The cycling conditions comprised 10 min polymerase acti - vation at 95 8 C and 40 cycles at 95 8 C for 15 s and 60 8 C for 30 s . For standardization , all samples were analyzed against HT29 cDNA as a reference sample using the 7000 SDS 1 . 1 RQ Software ( DD CT method ; Applied Biosystems ) ( 26 ) . Each sample was ampliﬁed in duplicate reactions and repeated in at least three independent experiments . No ampliﬁcation was obtained when RNA was mock - reverse - transcribed without adding reverse transcriptase . SDS – PAGE , western blotting and PAK CRIB - domain pull down assay Samples were prepared and detected as described ( 19 ) . The antibodies used for western blots were custom rabbit polyclo - nal anti - Rac1b serum ( 14 ) ; mouse anti - Rac ( clone 23A8 ) from Upstate Biotechnologies ; rabbit anti - c - Myc ( A - 14 ) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; mouse anti - SR proteins ( clone 1H4 ) , mouse anti - ASF / SF2 and mouse anti - SRp20 from Zymed - Invitrogen ; rabbit anti - PTEN from Cell Signaling ; mouse anti - Flag ( M2 ) , mouse anti - HA and mouse anti - a - tubulin ( clone B - 5 - 1 - 2 , as loading control ) from Sigma ; rabbit anti - GFP ( ab290 ) from Abcam ; and T7 - Tag antibody from Novagen / VWR . For densitometric analysis , ﬁlms from at least three independent experiments were digital - ized and analyzed using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . The PAK - CRIB - domain pull down assay was as described ( 19 ) . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared in 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 1 . 5 m M MgCl 2 , 420 m M NaCl , 0 . 2 m M EDTA , 25 % v / v glycerol with protease inhibitors , as described ( 69 ) , diluted to adjust the salt concentration to the EMSA binding buffer and puriﬁed in Microcon spin columns ( YM - 10 , Milli - pore ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Plasmid Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 19 3705 DNAs encoding the tested RNA probes were linearized at a Bam HI site , transcribed in vitro in the presence of a [ 32 P ] CTP ( 400 Ci / mmol , 10 mCi / ml ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) using a Maxiscript SP6 kit ( Ambion ) , and puriﬁed with Microspin G - 25 columns ( GE Healthcare ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Either 0 . 5 or 1 m g of the indi - cated nuclear extracts or 50 – 150 ng of recombinant ASF / SF2 ( ProteinOne , Bethesda ) or 100 – 500 ng of SRp20 ( N - terminal fragment 1 – 86 amino acid , Abnova ) was incubated for 5 min at 30 8 C in 20 m l reaction volumes containing EMSA binding buffer ( 12 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 72 . 5 m M KCl , 3 . 2 m M MgCl 2 , 20 m M creatine phosphate , 20 % glycerol , 1 m M DTT , 1 m M ATP , 40 U RNAsin , 125 ng of Escherichia coli tRNA and 0 . 5 mg BSA ) . Labeled RNA probes ( 8000 c . p . m . , 5 – 10 fmol ) were denatured at 95 8 C for 5 min , immediately chilled on ice and then added to the assay volume for 20 min at 30 8 C followed by chilling on ice . Protein – RNA complexes were resolved in 8 % non - denaturing polyacryl - amide gels ( acrylamide / bisacrylamide ratio of 29 / 1 ) in 0 . 5 (cid:3) TBE buffer , which was then dried and autoradiographed .
