Biophysical Journal Volume 71 July 1996 109 - 118 Theoretical Estimates of Mechanical Properties of the Endothelial Cell Cytoskeleton Robert L . Satcher , Jr . , and C . Forbes Dewey , Jr . Fluid Mechanics Laboratory , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 USA ABSTRACT Current modeling of endothelial cell mechanics does not account for the network of F - actin that permeates the cytoplasm . This network , the distributed cytoplasmic structural actin ( DCSA ) , extends from apical to basal membranes , with frequent attachments . Stress fibers are intercalated within the network , with similar frequent attachments . The microscopic structure of the DCSA resembles a foam , so that the mechanical properties can be estimated with analogy to these well - studied systems . The moduli of shear and elastic deformations are estimated to be on the order of 105 dynes / cm 2 . This prediction agrees with experimental measurements of the properties of cytoplasm and endothelial cells reported elsewhere . Stress fibers can potentially increase the modulus by a factor of 2 - 10 , depending on whether they act in series or parallel to the network in transmitting surface forces . The deformations produced by physiological flow fields are of insufficient magnitude to disrupt cell - to - cell or DCSA cross - linkages . The questions raised by this paradox , and the ramifications of implicating the previously unreported DCSA as the primary force transmission element are discussed . INTRODUCTION Monolayers of endothelial cells change morphology when stimulated with laminar shear stress . After exposure , the individual cells are torpedo shaped , with the long axis aligned with the fluid flow vector ( Dewey et al . , 1981 ) . Accompanying ( and producing ) this metamorphosis are changes in intracellular ionic flux ( Shen et al . , 1992 ; Sum - pio et al . , 1993 ) ; gene regulation , transcription , and trans - lation ( Resnick et al . , 1993 ) ; and cytoskeletal structure ( Davies , 1995 ; White et al . , 1983 ; Levesque et al . , 1986 ) . The mechanism by which cells detect shear stress is unde - fined . The cells must be deformed ; however , mechanical properties are poorly understood . The difficulty with deter - mining how endothelial cells respond to force has been due in large part to lack of a description of the precise architec - ture of the cell cytoskeleton and its enclosing membrane . The endothelial cell has a cytoskeleton composed of three polymers : F - actin , intermediate filaments , and microtu - bules . As the structural backbone , it perhaps allows the cell to detect forces by deformations and / or distortions at the membrane interface . Each component of the cytoskeleton has been studied by immunofluorescence , confirming that structure is altered when endothelial cells respond to shear stress ( Gotlieb et al . , 1991 ; Satcher et al . , 1992 ) . The most prominent documented changes occur with microfilaments ( Lewis and Lewis , 1924 ; White et al . , 1983 ) . F - actin com - prises a large percentage of the total protein in endothelial cells ( Satcher , 1993 ) and is organized and used in various ways .

Cross - linked F - actin microfilaments form the distributed cytoplasmic structural network ( DCS network ) that fills the cytoplasm ( Satcher , 1993 ) . Microfilaments are also grouped together with myosin and other actin - binding proteins to form 200 - 500 - nm - diameter bundles called " stress fibers . " The cell controls actin via a large armament of regulatory proteins , which shift actin between the poly - meric and monomeric ( G - actin ) pools as required . The assumed function of stress fibers is to reinforce the cell against surface shearing forces applied by blood flow ( White et al . , 1983 ; Wang et al . , 1994a ; Satcher et al . , 1992 ) . However , it is difficult to prove this while lacking knowl - edge of force transmission through endothelial cells . In previous work , we observed that the F - actin cytoskeleton and stress fibers are arranged in a configuration consistent with a force - bearing role ( Satcher , 1993 ) . In this paper we explore the possibility that forces distort the microfilament network , and the related question of whether stress fibers afford any mechanical advantage . There are earlier models of the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton . Measurements have been made using techniques such as micropipette aspiration ( Sato et al . , 1987 ) and magnetometry ( Wang et al . , 1994a ) to deform cells and infer mechanical properties . Theoretical treat - ments were offered by Fung and Liu ( 1993 ) , Wang et al . ( 1994b ) , and Theret et al . ( 1988 ) . However , these estimates were hindered by experimental limitations and lack of de - tailed information about cytoskeletal ultrastructure . For ex - ample , Sato et al . ( 1987 ) made measurements of mechanical properties using micropipette aspiration . Theret et al . ( 1988 ) constructed a model from these measurements to estimate the elastic modulus of the cortical cytoplasm based on the observed length of cell sucked into the micropipette by a specified pressure differential . To manipulate the cells , it was necessary to detach cells from monolayers using chem - rN4OTICE : THIS MATERIAL - MVI fi PROTECTEcD BYC COPYRGH1 LIA " i 109 Volume 71 July 1996 icals that are known to disrupt F - actin . Moreover , the model proposed by Theret was not based on detailed ultrastructural information . Wang et al . ( 1994a ) proposed that the endo - thelial cell cytoskeleton can be characterized as a tensigrity structure . By deforming the cell surface with magnetic beads bound to the extracellular matrix receptor integrin ( j , they showed that the measured stiffness increased with applied stress . If stresses are transmitted directly to the cytoskeleton by receptors , this is a good measure of me - chanical properties . According to the tensigrity model , F - actin filaments produce tension , which is partially supported by microtubules in compression . The model is primarily based on the observation that endothelial cells exert tension on the underlying substrate ( Wang et al . , 1994b ) . There is indirect evidence with fibroblasts to support this hypothesis : disruption of microtubules causes an increase in tension exerted on the substrate ( Kolodney and Wysolmerski , 1992 ) . However , there is no corroborating evidence for endothelial cells ; and the intracellular architecture predicted by this model has not been demonstrated experimentally . Fung and Liu ( 1993 ) consider shear stress in their model . A framework is established for analyzing the intracellular stress distribution , and a detailed calculation is performed for the limiting case of the cell membrane acting as the exclusive force - bearing structure in the cell . The opposing case of load bearing by the cytoplasm structure is not analyzed , because of a lack of detailed information about the mechanical properties of cytoplasm in endothelial cells . In the present study , we use prior observations ( Satcher , 1993 ) of the endothelial cytoskeleton with high - resolution three - dimensional electron microscopy to estimate mechan - ical properties . Elastic moduli for shear and tension / compression are computed and compare favorably with experimental data . F - actin bundles constructed in re - sponse to shear stress would be expected to reinforce the cortical network in the presence of laminar shear stress , reducing deformability and stabilizing the cell - cell at - tachment configuration . MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND METHODS Cell environment Endothelial cells form a monolayer that covers the inner - most aspect of arteries , serving as a barrier between flowing blood and artery wall . Individual cells have a profile similar to that of an egg that is sunny side up . They are flat except for a slight bulge caused by the nucleus . As illustrated in Fig . 1 , flowing blood contacts the lumenal surface of the monolayer . The artery wall beneath the monolayer is de - formed by fluid stress directed normal to the surface . How - ever , it is reasonable to assume that the shear modulus of the artery wall is much larger than the monolayer ( Dewey , 1979 ) . Thus , the endothelial monolayer is deformed more than the artery wall by shear stress . Cells grown for in vitro studies are affixed to a rigid glass coverslip on which FIGURE 1 Schematic diagram of endothelial monolayer ( adapted from Dewey et al . , 1981 ) . Direction of fluid flow is indicated by arrow . The cells are adherent to substrate below , so that shear stress imparted by the flow field is transmitted to basal membrane attachment points . / . = fluid viscosity . glycoproteins ( such as vitronectin , fibronectin , and laminin ) are layered by the cells themselves . Shear stress is transmitted through cells from the apical membrane to substrate by intervening structures ( the cy - toskeleton , cytoplasm , nucleus , etc . ) . Intracellular mechan - ical properties are therefore a composite of the characteris - tics of constituent filaments , cytoplasm , membrane , and organelles . But F - actin is the most likely load - bearing struc - ture for surface forces . The cortical cytoskeleton is predom - inantly constructed from F - actin . It attaches to the apical and basal cell membranes . There are specific differences in F - actin configuration between aligned and nonaligned cells , including a reorganized distributed cytoplasmic structural actin ( DCSA ) network and the presence of stress fibers with apical attachments in aligned cell ( Gotlieb et al . , 1991 ; Satcher , 1993 ) . In sheared cells intermediate filaments and microtubules are found in increased densities near the nu - cleus , but they appear at lower frequency than F - actin in most regions ( Satcher , 1993 ) . Moreover , solutions of inter - mediate filaments and microtubules have a lower mechan - ical modulus than solutions of F - actin , fluidizing at lower strains ( Janmey et al . , 1991 ) . We will determine the me - chanical properties of the F - actin cytoskeleton by creating a model based on ultrastructural detail . The results are com - pared with experimental measurements of endothelial cell mechanical properties . F - ACTIN MODEL The endothelial cytoskeletal network resembles the micro - scopic structure of various natural and synthetic materials , including wood , cancellous bone , coral , glass foams , bread , cornflakes , and paper , to name a few ( Fig . 2 ) . The F - actin cytoskeleton is an open lattice , formed from interconnected solid struts or fibers . Small deformations of this lattice occur Biophysical Joumnal 110 Properties of Endothelial Cell Cytoskeleton FIGURE 2 Comparison of endothelial cytoskeleton ( top picture ) with various " cellular solids " : ( a ) Felt , ( b ) paper , ( c ) cotton wool , ( d ) space shuttle tile . The microscopic structure is similar , because the distributed cytoplasmic structural actin network is formed by cross - linked actin fibers ( adapted from Gibson and Ashby . 1988 ) . by bending , stretching , and twisting of constituent fibers . Thus , mechanical properties should be derivable from con - stituent material mechanical properties and lattice geome - try . There are errors immediately apparent from this ap - proach , because the F - actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic system and is interconnected to microtubules and interme - diate filaments ( Runge et al . , 1981 ) . Moreover , the cross - links between F - actin fibers themselves are heterogeneous and would be expected to vary in binding strength . But we will postpone consideration of these factors until the end of our analysis , as it does not alter the fundamental premise of the model . The geometry of the network has primary , secondary , and tertiary levels of organization . At the lowest level , fibers are constructed from F - actin monomers . At the secondary level , fibers are cross - linked to form a porous network and to form bundles . At the highest level , the network of fibers and bundles surrounds organelles , fills the space between lume - nal and basal cell membranes , and forms complex interac - tions with the nucleus and membrane proteins . Forces trans - mitted from the cell surface would affect the lattice geometry at all levels . The F - actin network would be de - formed by various mechanisms , including linear elastic and / or plastic processes . We borrow from the analysis of " cellular solids " ( Gibson and Ashby , 1988 ) to proceed . Most lattice - like materials in tension and compression exhibit stress - strain relationships with two discernible regions : 1 ) linear elasticity at low stress , where deformation occurs by filament bending , stretching , or twisting . Elastic deformations are reversible - energy imparted to the material is stored and recovered when the material returns to its original shape . The Young ' s and shear moduli of the constitutive material determine the slope of the stress - strain curve for the lattice ; and 2 ) plas - ticity at higher stress , where deformation is by elastic buck - ling , plastic hinging , and brittle crush and fracture of fila - ments . Plastic deformations are dissipative - energy causes irreversible deformations of the material . If the network is fluid filled ( as in cells with cytoplasm ) , viscous work must be performed to move fluid in addition to deforming the lattice . This tends to increase the dynamic stiffness . Mod - eling based on this approach has yielded accurate scaling laws for a wide variety of materials ( Fig . 3 ) , because for small lattice deformations , the precise arrangement of fila - ments is not critical ( Gibson and Ashby , 1988 ) . The inte - grated response of the network is primarily a function of the amount of material per unit volume and ( of course ) the type of material . Consequently , analysis of a complicated open lattice such as the endothelial cytoskeleton can be ap - proached by choosing an array that has similar spatial density and arrangement of filaments , and in which network deformations are produced by the same microscopic pro - cesses of filament bending , stretching , twisting , and so forth . Such a network should exhibit the same or similar macroscopic behavior within a range of small deformations . We choose the configuration illustrated in Fig . 4 , an array of filaments of length I and square cross section of side t . Satcher and Dewey 111 i1 .

( b ) This configuration has been used with success in previous problems ( Gibson and Ashby , 1988 ) of elastic and plastic deformation of forms . Adjoining network " cells " are stag - gered , so that members meet at their midpoints . Note that the endothelial cytoskeleton connectivity and geometry are much more complex . But the model geometry captures the assumed response of the real network : deformations are produced by bending or stretching of constituent filaments . Analysis is facilitated by the simple arrangement of the elements . Future work can adopt more complicated junction geometries . Characterization of mechanical properties Mechanical properties can be expressed in terms of quan - tities such as density and moment of inertia , which can be difficult to determine for complex materials such as the F - actin cytoskeleton . However , by using a nondimensional form , we are able to express network parameters in terms of constituent filament properties and empirical constants . We define the relative density : - - relative density , FIGURE 4 ( a ) Unit cell of open - lattice model for cytoskeleton .

The relative density is related to the unit cell dimensions by Pas Ul ( 1 ) If we consider the filaments to be beams , the moment of inertia is related according to lat 4 . ( 2 ) Young ' s modulus is calculated by considering a mechanical deformation of the network . A uniaxial loading on the network causes each unit cell edge to transmit a force F , as illustrated in Fig . 4 b . The beams of length are loaded at their midpoints with force F .

Young ' s modulus of F - actin is estimated from the bend - ing modulus , r ( Osawa , 1977 ; Kishino and Yanagida , 1988 ) , using the relation E s = F / I . For F - actin , r = 1 . 7 x 10 ' 1 7 dyne - cm 2 ; and I = ra 4 / 4 for a cylinder of radius a . Using a = 3 . 5 nm , we get E , = 1 . 442 X 109 dyne / cm 2 . Substituting these values in Eq . 11 , we get E * 0 ( 105 dyne / cm 2 ) = 0 ( 10 4 N / m 2 ) and G * 0 ( 105 dyne / cm 2 ) = 0 ( 104 N / m 2 ) ( 12 ) ( 7 ) In Table 1 , we compare computed values with experi - mental measurements of the elastic shear modulus . Various ss T experimental schemes were used on solutions of pure F - bers actin , whole cells , and cytoplasm by different investigators . Our estimates compare favorably with F - actitisolutions of concentration approaching 10 mg / ml and with cytoplasm , in ( 8 ) both cases giving the same order of magnitude for the modulus of elasticity . It should be noted that the experi - ments were performed for small - deformations of the mate - rial of interest .

In the case of series elements ( Eq . 22 ) , and with parallel elements ( Eq . 15 ) , the respective constituent moduli Ep and E s are scaled by the area ratio An / A . These ratios can be estimated either directly , or by using a scaling argument . Endothelial cells typically have - 10 stress fibers per cell ( Gotlieb et al . , 1991 ) , comprising less than 1 % of the total F - actin mass ( Satcher , 1993 ) . If we assume that each connects to the lumenal membrane , the force on 1 / 10 of the lumenal membrane ( on average ) is the relevant tension for the series and parallel elements of Figs . 6 and 7 . Thus , the area of the membrane , A , is 1 / 10 the total lumenal membrane area . Next , we equate the network area ( Al ) to A , because the tensile force will be resisted by network beneath the membrane with equiv - alent cross - sectional area . Finally , we estimate the cross - sectional area of a stress fiber from morphological data . A typical stress fiber is 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 . m in diameter . The cross section is idealized as a circle . The elastic modulus of the network is known ( Table 1 ) ; and the modulus of stress fibers is assumed to be the same as that of F - actin . These values are substituted in Eqs . 15a and 21 to obtain the effective moduli Ep and Es ( Table 2 ) . We can alternatively estimate the area ratio based on the numbers of F - actin filaments and stress fibers . It can be argued that the area ratio A 2 / A 1 scales as the ratio of fila - ment numbers ( because network properties are determined by the density of filaments ) . Thus , A 2 / A 1 N ( stress fibers ) / N ( F - actin filaments ) = 10 / 105 = 10 - 4 . The predicted Young ' s modulus is included in Table 2 .

There is more augmentation with the parallel arrangement than with the series arrangement . Finally , if we estimate the network strain ( without stress fibers ) using physiological levels of shear stress ( 20 dynes / cm 2 ) ( Dewey , 1979 ) , £ E * = 10 - 4 ( 0 . 01 % ) . This is a surprising result - a deformation of 0 . 01 % is probably too small to affect network cross - links and there - fore would not be expected to directly disrupt filament - filament interactions . In addition , a cell would not be dis - placed significantly for this degree of deformation , so that it is highly unlikely that cell - cell contacts are directly affected . Elements in shear Stress fibers in apical regions might reduce the deformation caused by shear stress . To evaluate this effect , we consider series and parallel elements with shear loading . Analysis yields the same equations as for tensile loading ( see Eqs . 15 and 21 ) . Stress fibers in aligned cells are located just below the top membrane ( Satcher , 1993 ) , where they appear to attach . The length of aligned BAEC ( typical length - 40 gm ) is much more than the apical / basal thickness ( < 1 . 0 / gm ) . Stress fibers can extend for the length of a cell ( Satcher , 1993 ) ; thus , they are essentially parallel to the top membrane . Actin filaments branch from stress fibers and attach to the surrounding cortical network along the entire length of the fiber ( Satcher , 1993 ) . This is represented schematically in Fig . 8 . The shear modulus of stress fibers is assumed to be identical to F - actin ( - 109 dynes / cm 2 ) , which is much more than the shear modulus of the network ( 0 . 9 X 10 5 dynes / cm 2 ) . Without stress fibers the deforma - tion angle , y , is ( see Fig . 9 ) y = = 2 X 10 - 4 radians ( 0 . 01 ° ) A for r = 20 dynes / cm 2 . This is a physiologically insignif - icant deformation . Thus stress fibers acting in parallel , Satcher and Dewey 115 Volume 71 July 1996 FIGURE 8 Schematic of stress fiber beneath : top membrane , with many attachments to intervening dis - tributed cytoplasmic structural actin network . series , or any conceivable arrangement would have a van - ishing and probably irrelevant effect on reducing network deformation with comparable levels of shear stress . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Vascular endothelium grows as a monolayer of cells on the innermost aspect of the artery wall . As the interface between flowing blood and artery , the endothelial cells are able to withstand shear stress without mechanical damage . Cells are attached to the substrate below and neighboring cells on the sides . Forces on the lumenal cell membrane are trans - mitted to basal attachment sites . It had been postulated that T - shear stress G - shear modulus - deformation angle FIGURE 9 Schematic of deformation angle caused by uniaxial shear stress , on element of shear modulus G . this occurs via tension in the cell membrane ( Fung and Liu , 1993 ) . However , from three - dimensional ultrastructural studies , the cytoskeleton was identified as the probable load - bearing element in endothelium ( Satcher , 1993 ) . In endothelial cells , F - actin is organized as the distributed cytoplasmic network and as stress fibers . Other cells such as erythrocytes and platelets utilize an additional distinct sub - membranous network composed of F - actin to support the membrane and interface with the cytoskeleton . As with macrophages ( Hartwig et al . , 1988 ) , this network does not exist in endothelial cells . Rather , the distributed cytoskele - ton of endothelial cells appears to directly attach to the lumenal and basal membranes ( Satcher , 1993 ) . Stress fibers attach to focal adhesions , and probably with the lumenal membrane in aligned cells . And there are many connections between the DCSA and stress fibers . Thus force transmis - sion proceeds from surface to F - actin cytoskeleton to substrate . Our findings and observations of others are consistent with the cytoskeleton serving as the stress - bearing element ( Dewey et al . , 1981 ; Hartwig et al . , 1991 ; Wong et al . , 1983 ; White et al . , 1983 ) . Shear stresses are transmitted via the cytoskeleton - to - substrate attachments ( Davies et al . , 1994 ) . Fung proposed that shear stress is transmitted via the cell membrane itself to substrate attachments ( Fung and Liu , 1993 ) . However , there are many attachment points between the F - actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane ( Satcher , 1993 ) . Because the membrane only carries stress built up between attachments , the membrane levels would be low and perhaps insignificant . The bulk elastic shear and com - pressive / tension moduli were estimated by using the theory of foams ( Gibson and Ashby , 1988 ) . This approach uses simplifying assumptions concerning the cross - linking ( Nos - sal , 1988 ) and the geometry of the F - actin network . How - ever , calculated values are in good agreement with experi - 116 Biophysical Joumnal _ _ _ _ Properties of Endothelial Cell Cytoskeleton mental measurements on cytoplasm and F - actin gels ( Table 1 ) ( Janmey et al . , 1994 ) . Physiological forces do not signif - icantly deform the DCSA . Stress fibers would help to rein - force this network , effectively increasing the modulus in the vicinity of their attachments to the lumenal membrane . However , predicted deformations are so small that cell - to - cell contact regions and DCSA cross - linkages are unaf - fected . Therefore , the role of stress fibers for mechnotrans - duction is unclear . As discussed below , the alignment of stress fibers with the flow axis may be an intermediate stage that facilitates the metamorphasis to the flow - induced state . The transduction mechanism for shear stress is unknown . Others have postulated the existence of stretch receptors and stretch sensitive channels in the lumenal cell membrane ( Harrigan , 1990 ; Sachs , 1988 ) . Our findings are consistent with the existence of signaling proteins that are sensitive to deformation . A protein that links the cytoskeleton to the lumenal membrane could serve this function . There are discrete areas where the cytoskeleton is attached to the overlying membrane . In other cell types ( platelets and eryth - rocytes ) these linkages have been identified and studied extensively ( Hartwig et al . , 1989 ; Fox , 1985 ; Lux , 1979 ; Branton et al . , 1981 ) . Constituent proteins that compose these complexes include actin - binding protein ( ABP ) , spec - trin , and integral membrane proteins such as GP IX - lb . Endothelial cells may use these and other molecules for the linkage ( Gorlin et al . , 1990 ) . Shearing forces would displace the lumenal membrane relative to the cytoskeleton , so that the linkage molecules would be deformed , perhaps causing Ca 2 + or K + currents in response ( Shen et al . , 1992 ) . In the case of laminar flow , transcellular stress fibers are constructed as cells orient in the direction of flow . Buxbaum et al . ( 1987 ) have performed experiments showing that cytoplasm of some cells behaves as a thixotropic viscoelas - tic material in vitro - it deforms elastically until a critical yield stress is reached , then flows as an indeterminate fluid . The shear stress in flowing cytoplasm is independent of shear rate , because there is an inverse proportionality be - tween viscosity and shear rate ( Buxbaum et al . , 1987 ) . The yield stress of F - actin solutions in shear ( of - 10 mg / ml , the concentration of cytoplasm ) is on the order of dynes / cm 2 ( Kerst et al . , 1990 ) . The threshold shear stress for endothe - lial cell alignment is - 8 dynes / cm 2 ( Dewey et al . , 1981 ) . From our previous calculations , we know that gradients of - 40 % of average shear stress occur across the monolayer due to the protrusion of the nuclear bulge into the fluid stream ( Satcher et al . , 1992 ) . The cytoplasm may begin to flow at the points of highest shear stress , causing the align - ment of F - actin network fibers and subsequent construction of stress fibers . Because stress fibers increase the modulus of the network locally , the cytoplasmic streaming would be self - limited , stopping soon after stress fibers achieve their final length . When purified actin gels are subjected to shear stress , regions of aligned fibers aggregate to form a crys - talline phase that is very similar in morphology to stress fibers ( Cortese et al . , . 1988 ; Suzuki et al . , 1989 ; Buxbaum et al . , 1987 ; Ito et al . , 1987 ) . Moreover , ultrastructural studies . % show that many stress fibers in oriented cells tend to have one attachment at or around the nucleus , where stresses would be at a maximum ( Satcher , 1993 ) . Further studies are needed to assess the structural model proposed here . The distribution and length of stress fibers in three dimensions should be quantified . In addition , F - actin filaments probably interact with microtubules and interme - diate filaments . These proteins may bond F - actin filaments to each other at points of close proximity , decreasing the effective actin filament lengths . Our model does not account for such bridging , in part because the precise nature of interfilament interactions is unknown . The role of F - actin in alignment has been studied , but little is known about the role of intermediate filaments or microtubules for normal adjustments . The tensigrity model proposes that the F - actin cytoskeleton is maintained in a constant state of tension , using microtubules to support the compressive load ( Wang et al . , 1994 ) . Our model does not invalidate this hypothesis , but in contrast to tensigrity structures , interfilament tension is not required to explain observed adjustments in response to shear stress . Moreover , ultrastructural observations show that the density of microtubules in cytoplasm is much less than that of F - actin . The role of intermediate filaments and microtubules could be tested by observing alignment in the presence of agents that disrupt these filament systems . Our model also does not explain endothelial response to turbulent flow ( Davies et al . , 1986 ) . In this case , cells respond by dividing at average shear stresses below those needed to align cells ( - 2 - 3 dynes / cm 2 ) . An unknown sys - tem detects the inherent and intermittent chaotic variations in shear stress with turbulent flow . Further studies of cells in these conditions are needed to identify the mechanism involved . In conclusion , the theory of foams offers a means of modeling the mechanical properties of the distributed cyto - plasmic structural actin network ( DCSA ) . The predicted modulus of elasticity agrees with experimental measure - ments of cytoplasm and endothelial cells reported else - where . Stress fibers enhance the rigidity of the DCSA ; however , deformations produced by physiological flow fields are too small to affect cell attachments or DCSA cross - linkages . More studies are needed to investigate the role of stress fibers in cells . REFERENCES Adams , D . S . 1992 .
