Open Access Clinical Epigenetics Liver saturated fat content associates with hepatic DNA methylation in obese individuals Ratika Sehgal 1 , Alexander Perfilyev 2 , Ville Männistö 3 , Jyrki Ågren 4 , Emma Nilsson 2 , Pirjo Käkelä 5 , Charlotte Ling 2 , Vanessa D . de Mello 1† and Jussi Pihlajamäki 1 , 6 * † Abstract Background Accumulation of saturated fatty acids ( SFAs ) in the liver is known to induce hepatic steatosis and inflammation causing non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) and non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Although SFAs have been shown to affect the epigenome in whole blood , pancreatic islets , and adipose tissue in humans , and genome - wide DNA methylation studies have linked epigenetic changes to NAFLD and NASH , studies focusing on the association of SFAs and DNA methylation in human liver are missing . We , therefore , investigated whether human liver SFA content associates with DNA methylation and tested if SFA - linked alterations in DNA methylation associate with NAFLD - related clinical phenotypes in obese individuals . Results We identified DNA methylation ( Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip ) of 3169 CpGs to be associated with liver total SFA content ( q - value < 0 . 05 ) measured using proton NMR spectroscopy in participants of the Kuopio Obesity Surgery Study ( n = 51 ; mean ± SD : 49 . 3 ± 8 . 5 years old ; BMI : 43 . 7 ± 6 . 2 kg / m 2 ) . Of these 3169 sites , 797 over - lapped with previously published NASH - associated CpGs ( NASH - SFA ) , while 2372 CpGs were exclusively associated with SFA ( Only - SFA ) . The corresponding annotated genes of these only - SFA CpGs were found to be enriched in path - ways linked to satiety and hunger . Among the 54 genes mapping to these enriched pathways , DNA methylation of CpGs mapping to PRKCA and TSPO correlated with their own mRNA expression ( HumanHT - 12 Expression BeadChip ) . In addition , DNA methylation of another ten of these CpGs correlated with the mRNA expression of their neighboring genes ( p value < 0 . 05 ) . The proportion of CpGs demonstrating a correlation of DNA methylation with plasma glucose was higher in NASH - SFA and only - SFA groups , while the proportion of significant correlations with plasma insulin was higher in only - NASH and NASH - SFA groups as compared to all CpGs on the Illumina 450 K array ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Conclusions Our results suggest that one of the mechanisms how SFA could contribute to metabolic dysregulation in NAFLD is at the level of DNA methylation . We further propose that liver SFA - related DNA methylation profile may contribute more to hyperglycemia , while insulin - related methylation profile is more linked to NAFLD or NASH . Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind these observations .

Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 Background Non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is the most common chronic liver disease that spans in severity from simple steatosis to non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) and , ultimately , to hepatocellular carcinoma [ 1 ] . Excessive intake of dietary saturated fatty acids ( SFAs ) , increased free FAs ( FFAs ) released into the circulation from adipose tissue , upregulated de novo lipogenesis in the liver , and production of new hepatic fatty acids from carbohydrates or proteins are all known to induce hepatic steatosis and inflammation , causing NAFLD and NASH [ 2 – 5 ] . The lipotoxic effects of FFAs such as stress , autophagy , lipoapoptosis , and inflammation resulting from an imbal - ance in the hepatic FFAs availability and disposal are aggravated by the SFAs [ 6 – 8 ] . The largest contributor to the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides ( TG ) is satu - rated fats [ 9 ] . An excessive accumulation of SFAs in liver TG in individuals with non - alcoholic fatty liver or NASH compared to the normal liver has been recently reported [ 10 ] . Moreover , evidence suggests that the increased hepatic SFAs levels are linked to the cellular , oxidative , endoplasmic reticulum , and mitochondrial stress in NAFLD [ 11 – 14 ] . In fact , based on in vitro and in vivo studies , overexposure of SFAs in the cell culture medium or in the diet leads to inflammation , altered insulin sign - aling , and apoptosis in liver cells [ 15 – 17 ] . The pathogenesis of NAFLD is known to be modifi - able by lifestyle factors and genetic variations [ 18 ] , both of which may contribute to epigenetic dysregulation in NAFLD [ 19 – 21 ] . At present , the most widely and extensively investigated epigenetic modification , specifi - cally in metabolic diseases , is DNA methylation [ 22 ] . It is a reversible change playing a critical role in regula - tion of transcription , embryonic development , genomic imprinting , and chromatin structure [ 23 ] . These DNA methylome changes are often tissue specific and play a crucial role in reprogramming the cellular machinery as an adaptive response to calorie - excess environments , as in the case of NAFLD [ 22 , 24 ] . Many lipids , including FFAs and SFAs , have been pro - posed to cause NAFLD - linked epigenetic changes [ 25 ] . More specifically , SFA - induced changes in DNA meth - ylation have been proposed in cultured human pancre - atic islets and human adipose tissue . Furthermore , whole blood DNA methylation has been associated with dietary intake of fat in cross - sectional epidemiological studies carried out in normal - weight and obese children [ 26 – 29 ] . However , whether liver SFAs could influence the whole liver methylome has never been explored . Thus , the aim of the present study was to identify liver DNA methyla - tion patterns that associate with hepatic SFAs content in obese individuals . In addition , we sought to explore whether these alterations in SFA - related DNA methyla - tion associate with NAFLD - related clinical phenotypes . Results Liver total saturated fat content is elevated in NAFLD The clinical characteristics of the Kuopio Obesity Sur - gery ( KOBS ) study participants categorized based on their liver histology are shown in Table 1 . Fasting serum triglycerides ( TG ) and insulin levels were significantly different across the three groups : normal liver , simple steatosis ( SS ) , and non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) ( p value < 0 . 05 ) . The total liver saturated fat content ( SFA , See Table 1 ) was significantly elevated in those with SS Table 1 Clinical characteristics and liver histology of study participants according to histological liver phenotype Data are shown as mean ± SD or median ( IQR ) . fS—Fasting serum ; fP—fasting plasma ; LDL - c—low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ; HDL - c—high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ; TG—triglycerides ; N / Y—no / yes ; n—number of individuals ; and SFA—saturated fatty acids . a One - way ANOVA test ( continuous variable ) or χ 2 test ( categorical variable ) over the three study groups ; post hoc Bonferroni correction was used for multiple testing , * p value < 0 . 05 versus normal liver Normal liver SS NASH p value a Total , n 24 12 15 – Men / Women , n 8 / 16 5 / 7 6 / 9 n . s .

Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 and NASH as compared to those with normal liver ( p value < 0 . 05 ) . However , the saturated fat content was not different between the SS and NASH groups . Identification of SFA‑related DNA methylation in human liver We found that DNA methylation of 3169 CpG sites ( CpGs ) , representing 1881 unique genes , was signifi - cantly associated with liver SFA at a false discovery rate ( FDR ) below 5 % ( q - value < 0 . 05 , adjusted for gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , and age ; Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . Methylation on five of these 3169 sites was significantly associated with liver SFA after Bonferroni correction ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . Data from all the 51 indi - viduals ( Normal liver + SS + NASH ) were combined for this analysis . We have previously shown that DNA meth - ylation of 21 , 368 CpGs , representing 7788 unique genes , was associated with NASH [ 30 ] . In order to find the DNA methylation changes exclusively associated to SFA , we identified the CpGs specifically associated to SFA and not to NASH . In Fig . 1 , we describe that among the 3169 CpGs associated with liver SFA , 797 overlapped with those 21 , 368 that were previously observed to be NASH - related ( termed NASH - SFA ) . Consequently , the remain - ing 2372 SFA - related CpGs , representing 1424 unique genes , were exclusively related to liver SFA ( Only - SFA ) . Out of the 21 , 368 NASH - related CpGs [ 30 ] , 20 , 571 were exclusively related to NASH ( Only - NASH ) . From now on , we will address these as three groups named as fol - lows , only - NASH , NASH - SFA , and only - SFA ( Fig . 1 ) . Genomic location enrichment for the identified CpGs The genomic location enrichment for all the significant CpGs in each group ( Only - NASH , NASH - SFA , and only - SFA ) based on gene region showed significant differences between groups ( Fig . 2A ) . For all the three groups of CpGs , the largest proportion of CpGs was localized in the gene bodies and the intergenic regions . Further upstream ( TSS1500 ) , NASH - SFA and only - SFA groups were found to have significantly reduced proportions , while for only - NASH the proportions were higher compared to all 450 K array . For all the near gene transcription starting points ( TSS200 , 5 ′ UTR , and 1st Exon ) , among the three groups , the proportions of only - SFA associated CpGs were lower compared to CpG on the whole 450 K array . In fact , the proportions were also found to be reduced for only - NASH and NASH - SFA for the TSS200 and 1st Exon regions , when compared to all the whole 450 K array . However , for 5 ′ UTR region , proportions of CpGs were found to be significantly increased in NASH - SFA group . At the end region of the genes ( 3 ′ UTR ) , all the three groups followed a similar trend as in the upstream region : TSS1500 ( Fig . 2A ) . The percentage of CpGs based on island functional categories shows significant overrep - resentation of CpGs for all the three groups in the open sea and a significant underrepresentation in the CpG islands ( Fig . 2B ) . Also , only - SFA associated CpGs were significantly more localized in the southern shelf region ( 2 - 4 kb from CpG islands ) . Pathway analyses for the genes annotated to CpG sites To better elucidate the biological mechanisms of the sig - nificantly associated CpGs with SFA , we applied path - way analyses to the annotated genes that were associated with only - SFA and NASH - SFA . As illustrated in Table 2 , annotated genes to only - SFA were enriched for pathways related to morphine addiction , neuroactive ligand – recep - tor interaction , and retrograde endocannabinoid sign - aling . In contrast , NASH - SFA genes were significantly enriched for pathways related to cancer , inflammatory response , and insulin signaling . The pathways shown above are Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathways using the Web - Gestalt tool . The gene overlap means the number of genes identified in our dataset / total number of genes known to be involved in a particular pathway . q - value ( FDR ) for each pathway is shown in the last column . EGFR—Epidermal growth factor receptor ; PI3K - Akt— phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase / protein kinase B ; and Rap1 - Ras - proximate - 1 . Interaction mapping for only‑SFA annotated genes A total of 54 genes corresponding to the only - SFA enriched pathways ( Table 2 ) were used as an input to build an interaction map using the StringDB online tool [ 32 ] . Based on the interaction confidence level ( edge confidence ) , the topmost interactive genes were : CAC - NA1B ( calcium voltage - gated channel subunit alpha1 B ) , CNR1 ( cannabinoid receptor 1 ) , GNAI3 ( guanine Fig . 1 Overlap between the NASH - related and SFA - related CpGs in human liver . The Venn diagram represents the number of CpGs belonging to specific only - NASH and only - SFA groups and to the ones overlapping NASH - SFA group . The NASH - related CpG sites were defined based on our previous publication [ 30 ] , and the SFA - related CpG sites were identified as described in the results Page 4 of 12 Sehgal et al . Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 nucleotide - binding protein [ G Protein ] , alpha - inhibiting activity polypeptide 3 ) , PRKCA ( protein kinase C alpha ) , GNGT2 ( guanine nucleotide - binding protein G ( I ) / G ( S ) / G ( O ) subunit gamma - T2 ) , GNG12 ( guanine nucleotide - binding protein G ( I ) / G ( S ) / G ( O ) subunit gamma - 12 ) , ADCY6 ( adenylate cyclase type 6 ) , and DRD2 ( dopa - mine receptor D2 ) . From these genes , those that were also found to be enriched in more than one pathway are marked with a star in Fig . 3 . In addition to the KEGG pathways analysis , we found three GABA - related genes to be involved in all the four enriched pathways , GABRB1 ( gamma - aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit beta1 ) , GABRD ( gamma - aminobutyric acid type A recep - tor subunit delta ) , and GABRP ( gamma - aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit Pi ) . SFA‑related DNA methylation alterations correlate with gene expression The same set of CpGs related to only - SFA ( Table 2 and Fig . 3 ) were also tested for their correlation of Fig . 2 Genomic location enrichment for CpGs associated with SFA and / or NASH in human liver . Percentage of all CpGs located in relation to ( A ) nearest gene regions and ( B ) CpG island having important implications for the regulation of gene expression for only - NASH , NASH - SFA , and only - SFA groups , with percentage of all 450 K CpGs as control . CpG islands were defined as DNA sequences ( as 500 base windows ; excluding most repetitive Alu - elements ) with a GC base composition greater than 50 % and a CpG observed ratio [ 31 ] of more than 0 . 6 .

Each bar represents % of sites Page 5 of 12 Sehgal et al . Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 DNA methylation with the mRNA expression . Out of 64 CpGs ( 54 annotated genes ) , gene expression data were available for 14 genes on the Illumina expression array . We found the gene expression of PRKCA and TSPO ( Translocator Protein ) to be associated with the methylation of the corresponding CpG site with a p value < 0 . 05 ( PRKCA - cg14648237 and TSPO - cg13160331 , Table 3 ) . Alternatively , we correlated DNA methylation of all the 64 CpGs with the expression for transcripts located in the genomic region around these CpGs ( within the cis distance 500 kb upstream and 100 kb downstream of the gene ; Additional file 5 : Table S2 ) and identified ten significant correlations between the DNA methylation of the CpGs and mRNA expression ( p value < 0 . 05 , Table 3 ) . Among these , the strongest correlation was the one between methylation of cg11821200 and mRNA expression of PRKAA1 ( pro - tein kinase AMP - activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 ) . We also found correlations between DNA methylation of cg07011711 and cg00437258 with the mRNA expres - sion of SDHAF2 ( succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 ) and RAC1 ( Rac family small GTPase 1 ) , respectively ( Table 3 ) .

Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 Correlation of SFA‑related DNA methylation of CpGs with clinical variables In an effort to decipher the clinical significance , we tested the correlations of DNA methylation of the three groups of CpGs ( Only - NASH , NASH - SFA , and only - SFA ) with the laboratory measurements reflecting lipid and glucose metabolism : serum lipids , serum insulin , and plasma glu - cose levels ( represented as a heatmap in Additional file 2 : Fig . S1 ; adjusted p value < 0 . 1 tabulated in Additional file 6 : Table S3 ) . Using these data , we calculated the pro - portions of significantly correlated CpGs in each of these groups compared to the proportion of significantly cor - related CpGs in the whole 450 K BeadChip array . The proportions of significantly correlated CpGs were found to be statistically significantly higher for fasting plasma glucose , fasting serum insulin , and fasting serum TG in only - SFA group when compared to the proportions in the whole 450 K array ( p value < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4 ) . For plasma glucose levels , the proportions of significantly correlated CpGs were found to be increased for all three groups , when compared to all 450 K . Interestingly , for serum insulin levels the proportions of correlated CpGs for only - SFA were found to be significantly lower as com - pared to only - NASH and NASH - SFA groups , where the proportions were found to be higher compared to the whole array . An opposite trend was observed for the TG levels , with significantly higher proportions of correlated CpGs for only - SFA and lower proportions for only - NASH and NASH - SFA , compared to the whole 450 K . All these comparisons were also significant ( p value < 0 . 05 ) when adjusted p value was used for the correlations . Correlation of individual SFAs with the SFA‑related DNA methylation Next , we checked if individual SFAs ( 14 : 00 - myristic acid , 15 : 00 - pentadecanoic acid , 16 : 00 - palmitic acid , Table 3 Pearson correlations ( r ) between DNA methylation and mRNA expression at p value < 0 . 05 1 Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip - based DNA methylation and 2 HumanHT - 12 Expression BeadChip - based mRNA expression .

Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 17 : 00 - heptadecanoic acid , and 18 : 00 - stearic acid ) cor - relate distinctly with SFA - related DNA methylation . The data demonstrating correlations of these individual SFAs proportions ( mol % ) with the DNA methylation of the CpGs within each of the groups ( only - NASH , NASH - SFA , and only - SFA ) are shown in Additional file 3 : Fig . S2 . The correlation analysis was also adjusted for multi - ple testing ( p value < 0 . 1 ) , and the proportions were cal - culated across the groups ( Additional file 7 : Table S4 ) . We found that palmitic and stearic acid correlated more often with DNA methylation of the CpGs linked with SFA as compared to other SFAs in NASH - SFA and only - SFA groups . Discussion In the present study , we observed that liver content of total saturated fat ( SFA ) associates with the DNA meth - ylation profile in the liver of obese individuals , suggesting that SFA may regulate hepatic DNA methylation . When excluding those CpGs that we previously identified to be NASH - related [ 30 ] , we found that the CpGs solely meth - ylated in relation to liver SFA were enriched for pathways modulating satiety and food intake . These results were supported by the findings that methylation in some of these CpGs correlated with the expression of genes anno - tated to these CpGs , or with the expression of neighbor - ing genes . The observed differences in correlations of the DNA methylation of these with SFA - and NASH - related CpGs with fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin lev - els may reveal specific mechanisms related to NASH - linked clinical phenotypes . To our knowledge , this is the first study that attempts to identify SFA - related DNA methylation changes in the human liver . We identified total liver saturated fat con - tent measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) , to be associated with DNA methylation of 3169 CpGs in the current study ( Fig . 1 ) . It is well known that epigenetics plays an important part in the development of NAFLD and is often considered a modifiable contrib - uting factor [ 19 , 21 , 33 ] . Earlier studies carried out in humans have reported SFA - related DNA methylation changes in whole peripheral blood , adipose tissue , and cultured pancreatic islets [ 27 – 29 ] . Many of the identified CpG methylation sites in these studies were found to be linked with glucose and lipid metabolism , in line with the findings in this study . Furthermore , in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted the detrimental effects of SFAs on mechanisms linked with inflammation , lipid and glu - cose metabolism , and insulin signaling at the molecular and epigenetic levels [ 25 , 34 ] . We found that only - SFA associated CpGs localized in the gene bodies and intergenic regions , with lower pro - portions in the near and far transcription sites ( Fig . 2 ) . DNA methylation in the gene body region has been pre - viously found to display a direct effect on gene expres - sion [ 35 ] . Accordingly , DNA methylation changes in adipose tissue resulting from gastric bypass surgery have been reported to be mostly located in CpGs concen - trated in the body and intergenic regions [ 36 ] . In sum - mary , we suggest that the SFA - related differences in DNA methylation in relation to genetic location may link to epigenetic regulation . Additionally , to rule out the possi - bility of that a SNP on the CpG site would confound our results , the USCS genome browser was searched based on genomic coordinates for single nucleotide polymor - phism ( SNP ) . We found only one SNP ( rs138784380— genomic deletion ) that was on the corresponding CpG site ( cg05921947 , ADCY2 ) . The CpGs from which methylation was specifically associated with liver SFA , and not with NASH , were enriched for neuroactive ligand – receptor interaction , morphine addiction , and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathways ( Table 2 ) . The role of endocannabi - noids and related signaling molecules in controlling food intake and satiety is well established [ 37 – 39 ] . This is in line with the findings that many studies have identified that dietary FA composition differentially affects appetite and acts as endocannabinoid receptor ligands , with the SFAs being on the harmful end of the spectrum [ 40 – 42 ] . Thus , our current results highlight the probable involve - ment of SFAs in the regulatory mechanisms linked with hunger and energy intake . The effects of dietary fatty acids are heterogeneous in terms of metabolic and physi - ologic outcomes that are most correctly measured as diet - induced thermogenesis ( DIT ) and energy expendi - ture ( EE ) [ 43 ] . Dietary SFAs are linked with more weight gain compared to other FAs , attributed to the fact that SFA is more favored in the body as a storage nutrient since it is oxidized slower than other FAs [ 43 ] . It is very interesting to note that high - fat diet , specifically SFA , has been found to be related to development of obesity , with - out ingestion of too many calories , indicating a direct effect on feeding efficiency [ 43 ] . It has been also sug - gested that hepatic neuronal network is a major player in the regulation of calorie intake and energy expenditure , hence affecting the feeding efficiency [ 44 ] . Furthermore , alterations in hepatic sympathetic neuronal activity have been linked with obesity and NAFLD [ 45 , 46 ] . Although our results concentrating on SFAs and liver we cannot speculate the mechanisms regulating energy metabo - lism centrally , our findings suggest a connection between SFAs , satiety , and NAFLD development . Our results indicate that the 54 genes annotated to only - SFA CpGs also play a major role in maintaining the metabolic functions of the liver , mainly by regulat - ing glucose and insulin metabolism ( Fig . 3 ) . For example , Page 8 of 12 Sehgal et al . Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 the gene CACNA1B codes for a calcium ion channel that regulates glutamate transport across the cell membrane , which is a major substrate for glucose production . There were many genes coding for G - proteins and their subu - nits , such as GNAI3 , GNGT2 , GNG12 , GABRB1 , GABRP , and GABRD . We agree that many of these , such as GABRB1 , GABRP , and GABRD genes , are not known to be major regulators in the liver . Most of them are essen - tial for a variety of cellular functions , and few of these had been identified to be major players in NAFLD pro - gression [ 47 – 49 ] . We also identified a key gene , PRKCA , characterized as a lipid - dependent kinase with a major role in both positive and negative modulation of insulin action [ 50 ] . Additionally , we observed DNA methylation of TSPO , encoding a potential molecular imaging bio - marker for noninvasively distinguishing NAFLD , [ 51 ] to be related with SFA and associated with TSPO mRNA expression . Finally , we acknowledge that many of the genes related to identified CpG sites are primarily identi - fied as neuronal genes , and thus , their role in liver metab - olism remains unclear . We also found DNA methylation of another ten of these CpGs correlated with the mRNA expression of their neighboring genes ( Table 3 ) . Most of the identified genes were involved in functions related to neurotransmis - sion and substrate metabolism , such as PRKAA1 , RAC1 , SDHAF2 , C14orf132 , FCHSD2 , GALE , and ZDHHC4 . These genes have previously been found to be key players in controlling energy metabolism and appetite by actively sensing and responding to stimuli , most importantly to the nutrients [ 52 – 57 ] . Interestingly , we found , KDM5B , a gene encoding lysine - specific histone demethylase that belongs to the jumonji / ARID domain - containing family of histone demethylases . In general , histone methylation plays an important role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and hence might be of biological relevance in the case of SFA . Overall , these results reflect that SFAs seem to influence the gene expression changes of impor - tant genes by affecting the DNA methylation . The interesting novel finding was that fasting plasma glucose levels were more often correlated with the SFA - related CpGs , while for the only - NASH CpGs the most significant associations were with fasting serum insulin levels ( Fig . 4 ) . Accordingly , we have previously shown that NASH - related epigenetic alterations associate with changes in insulin action , [ 30 ] Contrary to what was expected based on previous studies , [ 58 , 59 ] , we did not find any significant change in the proportions of the only - SFA associated CpGs and cholesterol and / or LDL - c levels . Nonetheless , the percentage of significantly asso - ciated CpGs for HDL - c and TG levels were significantly higher for only - SFA , as compared to the coverage on the whole 450 K array ( Fig . 4 ) . We found palmitic and stearic acid to be the most cor - related more often with DNA methylation of the CpGs linked with SFA . Earlier studies in humans and human - derived cells have found that both palmitic and stearic acids actively interact with the epigenome [ 25 , 27 , 29 , 60 ] . For instance , excess palmitic and stearic acid is known to induce inflammation and metabolic dysregulations in various cell models ( including primary murine hepato - cytes ) along with alterations in histone acetylation and DNA methylation [ 61 – 64 ] . Our findings reiterate that among the individual SFAs , both palmitic and stearic acids are the main contributors to the observed SFA - related correlation with DNA methylation . We acknowledge that the current study is cross - sec - tional and , hence , limits our conclusions related to cau - sation . However , it is unethical to have follow - up liver biopsies in these types of studies . In addition , the study size is limited and as all the subjects were morbidly obese , we cannot generalize the results to lean or nor - mal - weight subjects . However , with this unique dataset with liver samples collected during the bariatric surgery from a gender - , BMI - , and age - matched study cohort , we were able to have a holistic view of the liver , monitoring simultaneously histology , DNA methylation , and gene expression . Conclusions In conclusion , we propose that one of the mechanisms how SFA may contribute to the metabolic dysregulation in NAFLD might occur at the level of DNA methyla - tion . In addition , we suggest that liver SFA - related differ - ences in DNA methylation profile may contribute more to hyperglycemia , while insulin - related differences are more linked to changes in methylation specific to NASH in this particular study population and setting . Due to the cross - sectional study design , we fully admit no conclu - sions about causality are possible . Further research is also needed to elucidate the mechanistic links of our current findings . Methods Study participants and analyses of clinical and metabolic parameters Participants were selected from an ongoing Kuopio Obesity Surgery ( KOBS ) Study [ 65 ] . Fifty - one individu - als undergoing laparoscopic Roux - en - Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB ) operation ( mean ± SD , 49 . 3 ± 8 . 5 years old ; BMI , 43 . 7 ± 6 . 2 kg / m 2 ; 19 males ) were included . All individuals had their anthropometric and biochemi - cal evaluations done before the surgery . Fasting serum samples were subjected to lipid profiling and insulin measurements , while fasting plasma glucose levels were measured , as described before [ 66 ] . Type 2 diabetes was Page 9 of 12 Sehgal et al . Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 defined according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria . The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants , and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Northern Savo Hospital District ( 54 / 2005 , 104 / 2008 , and 27 / 2010 ) . Liver histology and liver phenotype Liver biopsies were obtained with ultrasonic scissors dur - ing the elective LRYGB operation from all the patients participating in the KOBS study . The overall histological assessment of liver biopsies was performed by a patholo - gist according to the standard criteria [ 67 , 68 ] . Individu - als were then grouped into one of the three categories : 1 . Normal liver without any steatosis , inflammation , bal - looning , or fibrosis , 2 . SS ( steatosis > 5 % without evidence of hepatocellular ballooning , inflammation , or fibrosis ) , or 3 . NASH ( detailed in Table 1 ) [ 65 , 66 ] . Liver total SFA content using NMR spectroscopy Fasting concentrations of liver SFA content were ana - lyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy in native liver samples . At first , the liver samples were homogenized , mixed , sonicated , centri - fuged , and dried . Prior to NMR analysis , the extracted lipids were redissolved into 600 µl of CDCl 3 contain - ing 0 . 03 % of tetramethylsilane as a reference substance . 1 H NMR spectra of extracted lipids were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 600 NMR spectrometer with acquisition time of 5 s and the relaxation delay of 15 s , as described previously [ 66 ] . The PERCH NMR software was used for all the lineshape fitting analyses . Quantification of individual SFAs using gas chromatography The liver fatty acid composition in triglycerides ( TG ) , cholesteryl esters ( CE ) , and phospholipids ( PL ) was measured by gas chromatography ( GC ) . The liver fatty acids were analyzed according to previously described methods [ 66 ] . In short , liver lipids were extracted with chloroform – methanol ( 2 : 1 ) , and the lipid fractions were separated by solid phase extraction with an aminopro - pyl column . Fatty acids in TG , CE , and PL were trans - methylated with boron trifluoride in methanol and were analyzed with a 7890 A gas chromatograph ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Wilmington , DE , USA ) equipped with a 25 - m FFAP column using nonadecanoic acid as the internal standard as detailed before [ 66 ] . The total SFAs in each of these fractions ( molar percentages , mol % ) were then correlated with the liver total SFA content identified using the NMR spectroscopy ( Additional file 4 : Fig . S3 ) . The TG fraction was found to be most strongly correlated ( r = 0 . 35 , p value < 0 . 05 ) , and the individual SFAs from this fraction were considered for further analyses . DNA methylation and gene expression in human liver The DNA extracted from the human liver biopsies was used for DNA methylation analysis using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . The raw methylation data in β - values were converted to M - values for bioinformatic and statistical analyses ; however , β - values were used for describing the data and creating figures as reported earlier along with the methodology [ 30 , 69 ] . DNA methylation of 455 , 526 CpGs was associated with liver SFA content . RNA expression was analyzed in liver samples from a subset of individuals included in this study ( n = 20 ) using the HumanHT - 12 Expression BeadChip ( Illumina ) . The array covers 28 , 688 coding transcripts , and all the procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and are detailed elsewhere [ 69 ] . A total of 12 , 064 transcripts passed the quality control filter and were considered for further analysis . Identification of SFA‑related DNA methylation sites including genomic enrichment analysis To identify differences in DNA methylation in the liver associated with liver total SFA content , a linear regres - sion model was used including gender , BMI , and age as covariates and DNA methylation as the dependent vari - able . To account for multiple testing in the genome - wide analysis , we applied false discovery rate ( FDR ) as well as Bonferroni correction and considered significant probes with q - value < 0 . 05 . We overlapped the identified CpGs with the ones we had previously found to be associated with NASH [ 30 ] , to get three distinct datasets , only - NASH , NASH - SFA , and only - SFA CpGs . Comparison of these three datasets to annotated function categories , including relation to genes ( within 1500 bp of a transcription start site [ TSS ] , 200 bp of a TSS , a 5 ′ untranslated region [ UTR ] , first exon , gene body , 3 ′ UTR , and intergenic ) and CpG islands ( Island , shore , shelf , open sea ) , was performed using UCSC ( University of California Santa Cruz ) Genome Browser annotations supplied by Illumina . A χ 2 test of independ - ence with 1° of freedom was used to determine whether there was evidence of enrichment for any of these groups as compared to the coverage on the 450 K BeadChip . ( p value < 0 . 01 was considered statistically significant . ) Pathway analysis of genes mapped to CpG sites associated with liver SFA We performed a KEGG pathway analysis using the Web - Gestalt tool [ 70 ] to identify biological pathways enriched for genes mapped to CpGs associated with liver SFA Page 10 of 12 Sehgal et al . Clinical Epigenetics ( 2023 ) 15 : 21 ( q - value < 0 . 05 ) . For this , we considered the only - SFA and NASH - SFA groups separately . StringDB ( Version 11 . 5 ) was used to visualize the gene interactions for the enriched pathways and selection of the genes [ 31 ] . The top genes with the maximum interaction nodes or involvement in all the enriched pathways were shortlisted and discussed . We also correlated these top - ranking CpGs with the mRNA expression of their nearby gene ( s ) ( within the cis distance 500 kb upstream and 100 kb downstream of the gene , Additional file 5 : Table S2 ) , and p value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Statistical analyses Clinical data are presented as mean ± SD or median ( interquartile range : IQR ) . One - way ANOVA ( continu - ous variable ) or χ 2 test ( categorical variable ) was used to study the differences in the clinical variables , liver histology , and total SFA content for the three study groups ( normal liver , simple steatosis ( SS ) , and NASH ; n = 51 ) . After applying further post hoc Bonferroni cor - rection for multiple testing , p values < 0 . 05 were consid - ered significant . Pearson correlation analysis was used to corre - late DNA methylation of selected CpGs with gene expression , clinical variables , and individual SFAs ( 14 : 00 - myristic acid , 15 : 00 - pentadecanoic acid , 16 : 00 - palmitic acid , 17 : 00 - heptadecanoic acid , and 18 : 00 - stearic acid ) . For these analyses , a p value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . For the correla - tions with clinical variables , a χ 2 test of independence with 1° of freedom was used to determine if the propor - tion of sites was significantly ( p value < 0 . 05 ) different for each variable as compared to the coverage on the 450 K BeadChip .
