WASp - interacting protein ( WIP ) binds to and stabilizes WASp but also interacts with actin . Using mice with a mutated actin binding domain of WIP ( WIP D ABD ) , we here investi - gated the role of WIP binding to actin during B cell activation . We found an altered differentiation of WIP D ABD B cells and diminished antibody afﬁnity maturation after immunization . Mechanistically , WIP D ABD B cells showed impaired B cell receptor ( BCR ) - induced PI3K signaling and actin reorganiza - tion , likely caused by diminished CD81 expression and altered CD19 dynamics on the B cell surface . WIP D ABD B cells displayed reduced in vivo motility , concomitantly with impaired chemotaxis and defec - tive F - actin polarization , HS1 phosphorylation , and polarization of HS1 to F - actin - rich structures after CXCL12 stimulation in vitro . We thus concluded that WIP binding to actin , independent of its binding to WASp , is critical for actin cytoskeleton plasticity in B cells . INTRODUCTION B cells are an integral part of the adaptive immune system . Although correct activation of B cells protects the host against a variety of infections and cancers , aberrant B cell activation has been implicated in the development of autoimmune dis - eases . The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in regulating this lymphocyte activation . In steady state , the B cell receptor ( BCR ) is immobilized on the plasma membrane by areas of high - density cortical actin cytoskeleton . Antigen - induced BCR signaling leads to an early rapid wave of actin depolymerization ( Hao and August , 2005 ) , removing barriers to BCR diffusion and modifying BCR dynamics at the cell surface . Furthermore , changes in actin organization alone increase BCR diffusion in a ligand - independent manner and trigger signaling similar to BCR crosslinking ( Treanor et al . , 2010 ) , involving the co - receptor CD19 held in place by its association with the tetraspanin mole - cule CD81 ( Mattila et al . , 2013 ) . Hence , the actin cytoskeleton organizes and immobilizes the BCR and regulates the BCR prox - imity to its co - receptors in the plasma membrane ( Gasparrini et al . , 2016 ; Mattila et al . , 2016 ; Song et al . , 2014 ; Tolar , 2017 ) but is also needed for the correct reorganization of the plasma membrane surface in response to extracellular clues , thereby regulating intracellular signaling . Regulators of actin dynamics that limit BCR mobility and thus antigen - independent BCR signaling may prevent spontaneous B cell activation . As a consequence , lack of these actin regula - tors can result in disease , as seen in Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) . WAS is an X - linked disorder associated with eczema , increased susceptibility to infections , and heightened risk of autoimmune disorders ( Thrasher , 2009 ) , which is caused by mu - tations in Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) ( Stewart et al . , 1999 ) or in WASp - interacting protein ( WIP ) ( Lanzi et al . , 2012 ; Pfajfer et al . , 2017 ) . Functional defects are more severe in B cells of Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , which lack WIP and WASp , than in B cells of WASp - deﬁcient mice , suggesting that WIP interaction with actin might be crucial for B cell cytoskeletal plasticity and function . WIP binding to WASp protects it from degradation and regulates its cellular distribution ( Fried et al . , 2014 ) . How - ever , WIP promotes actin polymerization independently of WASp by binding and stabilizing actin ﬁlaments ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ; Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) . Binding of WIP to actin is medi - ated by the N - terminal verprolin homology region that includes an amino acid sequence ( amino acids 43 – 54 ) containing a KLKK motif critical for actin binding to thymosin b4 ( Anto´n et al . , 2003 ; Van Troys et al . , 1996 ) . Using Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , we have shown that WIP regulates B cell homing , chemotaxis , sur - vival , and differentiation due to an altered CD19 cell surface Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 ª 2018 The Author ( s ) . 619 This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) . dynamics , resulting in impaired phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) signaling after triggering a variety of receptors ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) . However , the role of WIP binding to actin , in contrast to its WASp stabilizing function in B cells , has not been studied so far . Mice lacking the actin binding domain ( ABD ) of WIP ( WIP D ABD ) have been generated ( Massaad et al . , 2014 ) , and T cells of these mice displayed decreased cellular ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) content , impaired chemotaxis , and defective hom - ing to lymph nodes despite having normal WASp expression ( Gallego et al . , 2006 ; Massaad et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we dissected the role of WIP binding to actin from its WASp stabilizing function during B cell activation . We found that the lack of WIP binding to actin in B cells resulted in an altered humoral immune response with reduced antibody afﬁnity maturation in response to immunization . We furthermore demonstrated that the binding of WIP to actin alone inﬂuences CD81 expression and hence CD19 diffusion on the B cell surface , which correlated with an impaired actin cytoskel - etal reorganization and diminished PI3K signaling after BCR and CXCR4 stimulation . The binding of WIP to actin is sufﬁcient to regulate B cell chemotaxis to CXCL12 and in vivo migration . On a more molecular level , we found a defective F - actin polariza - tion , together with a diminished localization of HS1 in F - actin rich structures , after CXCL12 stimulation of B cells lacking the bind - ing of WIP to actin . From these results , we concluded that the binding of WIP to actin , independent of its binding to WASp , is critical for actin cytoskeleton plasticity in B cells , thereby inﬂu - encing PI3K signaling , migration , and antibody production . RESULTS B Cells Lacking the Binding of WIP to Actin Demonstrate Altered Humoral Immune Responses We previously showed that the absence of WIP exclusively in B cells impairs mouse immune responses by compromising germinal center ( GC ) responses and antibody production ( Kep - pler et al . , 2015 ) . To establish whether WIP binding to actin has an effect on humoral immune responses , we generated mixed bone marrow ( BM ) chimeras by reconstituting lethally irradiated congenic BALB / c CD45 . 1 animals with a mixture of 50 % CD45 . 1 wild - type ( WT ) BM and 50 % CD45 . 2 WIP D ABD mutant BM ( WT - WIP D ABD ) , WIP - deﬁcient BM ( WT - Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) , or WT - WT BM . These mixed chimeras were used to analyze reconstitution and the formation of GC B cells in a competitive environment . During analysis of these mixed chimeras , we found a 50 % reduction of CD45 . 2 Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells compared to CD45 . 1 WT B cells , altering the ratio of CD45 . 1 to CD45 . 2 B cells from 50 : 50 initially to 80 : 20 in the spleen , similar to what we have described previ - ously ( Figure S1A ) ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) . We further detected a 20 % reduction of CD45 . 2 WIP D ABD B cells compared to CD45 . 1 WT B cells ( Figure S1A ) , suggesting that under these conditions , WT cells also partially outcompete WIP D ABD B cells for access to the mature B cell niches . Next , chimeric mice were challenged with the T cell - dependent antigen ( 4 - Hydroxy - 3 - Ni - trophenyl ) Acetyl - Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ( NP - KLH ) in alum and analyzed 13 days later using ﬂow cytometry . We observed a robust formation of GC B cells in the spleens of all immunized chimeras , with about 29 % of CD45 . 1 WT B cell stain - ing positive for GC markers ( GL7 + CD95 + NP + of B220 + ) ( Fig - ure 1A , lower panel ) . We used the percentages of CD45 . 2 + GC cells , as well as the ratio of CD45 . 2 / CD45 . 1 GC B cells , as a readout to compare the ability of WT , WIP D ABD , and Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells to compete with the CD45 . 1 WT cells present in the same animal . We found that , similar to CD45 . 2 Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells ( Figure S1B ) , CD45 . 2 WIP D ABD B cells were signiﬁcantly impaired in GC formation compared to CD45 . 2 WT B cells ( Fig - ure 1A , upper panel and graphs on the right ) . Next , we analyzed class - switching to immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G1 and expression of interferon regulated factor 4 ( IRF4 ) —a hall - mark transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation . During the GC response , IRF4 downregulation is required for the B cells to stay in the GC , whereas cells expressing high levels of IRF4 exit the GC to become plasma cells ( Li et al . , 2018 ) . Intracellular staining of NP - speciﬁc CD45 . 2 B cells revealed two populations : one expressing IRF4 and intermediate levels of IgG1 ( IRF4 int and IgG1 int ) and a population expressing high levels of IgG1 and further upregulation of IRF4 ( IRF4 + and IgG1 hi ) . A higher percent - age of WIP D ABD B cells differentiated into IRF4 + - and IgG1 hi - ex - pressing cells ( 58 % of CD45 . 2 cells ) compared to WT or Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells ( 29 . 4 % or 27 % of CD45 . 2 cells , respectively ) ( Figure 1B ; Figure S1C ) . These results suggest a preferential engagement of WIP D ABD B cells into the plasma cell differenti - ation pathway . To analyze antibody responses after immunization , we next generated mixed BM chimeras by adoptively transferring a mix of BM from either WT or WIP D ABD mice and BM from mice that lack B cells ( JHT mice ) into lethally irradiated JHT recipients . BM of both WT and WIP D ABD mice reconstituted the B cell compartment in the spleen , but BM from WIP D ABD mice showed reduced reconstitution in the BM of recipient mice ( Fig - ure S1D ) . Puriﬁed splenic B cells of WIP D ABD mixed BM chi - meras demonstrated detectable WASp levels in immunoblot , indicating that WASp stabilization is intact in B cells carrying the mutant WIP gene locus ( Figure S1E ) . B cell population anal - ysis in the spleen of WIP D ABD chimeras by ﬂow cytometry showed similar marginal zone ( MZ ) populations ( CD21 hi and CD23 int ) and mature B cell populations ( IgD hi and IgM int ) when compared to WT chimeras , unlike B cells from Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) chi - meras , which lack MZ B cells ( Figure S1F ) . Following reconstitution , chimeric mice were challenged with the T cell - dependent antigen NP - KLH in alum . Quantifying early NP - speciﬁc antibody titers in the serum of immunized mice by ELISA , we found that WIP D ABD chimeras had similar yet slightly delayed NP - speciﬁc IgM and IgG3 antibody concentrations compared to WT chimeras ( Figure 1C ) . The production of NP - speciﬁc class - switched antibodies was increased at later time points in WIP D ABD chimeras , with a 2 - fold increase of total IgG antibodies and a slight increase of IgG1 antibodies compared to WT chimeras ( Figure 1D ) . To check for afﬁnity maturation of the class - switched antibodies , we compared the ratio of the IgG1 binding efﬁciency to NP 4 ( higher afﬁnity ) and NP 29 ( lower afﬁnity ) . We observed a steady increase in the NP 4 / NP 29 ratio of WT antibodies , indicating the production of high - afﬁnity antibodies over time . The NP 4 / NP 29 ratio in the sera of WIP D ABD chimeras was about 2 - fold lower at day 28 after immunization ( Figure 1E ) . Using ﬂow cytometry , the 620 Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 generation of GC B cells was measured 13 days after immuniza - tion in the spleen of chimeric mice . We detected a robust forma - tion of GC ( B220 + , NP + , GL7 + , and CD95 + ) B cells in both JHT - WT and JHT - WIP D ABD chimeras ( Figure S1G ) , as reﬂected in numbers of GC - positive cells per spleen . These results indi - cate that although the GC formation and titers of NP - speciﬁc class - switched antibodies are comparable or even higher in sera of WIP D ABD compared to WT chimeras , these antibodies fail to afﬁnity mature after immunization . Collectively , these in vivo experiments suggest that B cells lacking the ABD of WIP have an altered humoral immune response to immunization , with hampered antibody afﬁnity R a t i o o f G C c e ll s CD 45 . 2 / CD 45 . 1 B 220 + N P + ( % ) 0 1 . 0 1 . 5 CD 95 GL7 WT CD45 . 1 0 . 5 WT CD45 . 1 CD 95 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 38 . 8 WT CD45 . 2 A dABD CD45 . 2 GL7 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 28 . 3 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 29 . 4 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 28 . 4 gated on CD3 neg / CD19 pos / NP pos * * 6000 0 3000 ( t i t e r s i n A U ) Days post - immunisation IgM 0 IgG3 C 0 7 28 21 14 1 . 0 0 0 . 5 R a t i o N P 4 / N P 29 o f I g G 1 Days post - immunisation 4000 2000 0 0 IgG1 8000 4000 IgG 10000 5000 E G C c e ll s CD 45 . 2 + B 220 + N P + ( % ) 0 30 50 10 * * ( t i t e r s i n A U ) Days post - immunisation D I R F 4 IgG1 WT dABD 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 42 . 4 58 . 1 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 76 . 6 29 . 4 B gated on CD3 neg / CD45 . 2pos / NP pos / IgG1 pos I R F 4 i n t I g G 1 i n t o f CD 45 . 2 + N P + ( % ) 0 50 100 * * * * I R F 4 + I g G 1 h i o f CD 45 . 2 + N P + ( % ) 0 40 80 * * * * 0 7 28 21 14 0 7 28 21 14 0 7 28 21 14 0 7 28 21 14 dABDWT dABDWT dABDWT dABDWT dABDWT dABDWT Figure 1 .

Binding of WIP to Actin Inﬂuences PI3K Signaling and BCR - Induced Actin Reorganization To account for the altered differentiation of WIP D ABD mutant B cells after immu - nization , we analyzed the inﬂuence of WIP binding to actin on BCR signaling . For this , we stimulated WT and WIP D ABD B cells with immobilized anti - k - chain antibody on beads and measured the BCR - induced phosphory - lation of the co - receptor CD19 and the kinases Akt and Erk by immunoblot . Both cell types displayed robust phos - phorylation of Erk after BCR crosslinking ( Figure 2A ) . However , the phosphorylation of CD19 as well as Akt was not detectable in WIP D ABD mutant B cells compared to WT cells ( Figure 2A ) . We also obtained a reduced phosphorylation of CD19 and Akt in WIP D ABD B cells compared to WT cells using stimulation with soluble anti - k - chain antibody ( Figure S2A ) . To determine whether this diminished signaling after BCR stimulation might be caused by altered actin regulation , we next analyzed levels of F - actin in steady - state WT and WIP D ABD B cells . Phalloidin staining revealed comparable total amounts of F - actin in naive WIP D ABD B cells and WT B cells ( Figure 2B ) , as measured by ﬂow cytometry . The total increase in F - actin per Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 621 cell after soluble BCR activation was impaired in WIP D ABD B cells compared to WT cells ( Figure S2B ) . Next , we investigated whether WIP binding to actin affects the reorganization of F - actin in activated B cells . For this , WT and WIP D ABD B cells were spread on coverslips with immobilized antigen , stained for F - actin with phalloidin and analyzed using structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) imaging . Although WT B cells exhibited a char - acteristic peripheral F - actin ring and about 70 F - actin foci per cell , WIP D ABD B cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower amount of F - actin foci with an average of 50 foci per cell ( Figure 2C ) . The defects in F - actin formation resulted neither in the incapacity to spread nor in a defect of F - actin polymerization at the leading edge of WIP D ABD . Altogether , these results point at a reduced plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton after stimulation in B cells lacking WIP binding to actin . Collectively , these results suggest that the binding of WIP to actin inﬂuences BCR - induced actin reorganization and is impli - cated in BCR - driven PI3K signaling likely inﬂuencing the differ - entiation of B cells after activation .

Binding of WIP to Actin Affects CD19 Diffusion on the B Cell Surface We previously showed that in the absence of WIP , the actin cytoskeleton , as well as the CD81 tetraspanin network , is disturbed , leading to increased diffusion of CD19 on resting B cells and resulting in impaired PI3K signaling ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) . Because we observed reduced CD19 , as well as Akt phosphorylation , in WIP D ABD mutant B cells after BCR stimu - lation , we went on to analyze the inﬂuence of WIP binding to actin on CD19 diffusion on the resting B cell surface . For this , we performed single - par - ticle tracking ( SPT ) of CD19 by incubating primary B cells with limited amounts of ﬂuorescently labeled anti - CD19 Fab frag - ments , followed by analysis with total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy . Unlike CD19 particles on Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells , CD19 particles on the surface of WIP D ABD mutant B cells were relatively immobile , with the median diffusion coef - ﬁcient only slightly increasing from 0 . 009 m m 2 / s on WT B cells to 0 . 012 m m 2 / s on WIP D ABD mutant B cells ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Video S1 ) . Two populations of CD19 particles on the surface of B cells could be distinguished based on a higher and lower mobility . This more detailed analysis revealed a shift of CD19 molecules to the population retaining higher mobility on the sur - face of WIP D ABD mutant B cells , with an increase from 36 % on WT B cells to 55 % on WIP D ABD mutant B cells ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . We next analyzed CD19 and CD81 expression levels on the surface of WIP D ABD mutant and WT B cells . In line with F - actin levels ( Figure 2B ) , CD19 expression was comparable between 622 Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 the two cell types ( Figure 3E ) . However , the expression of the tet - raspanin protein CD81 on the surface of WIP D ABD mutant was often reduced ( Figure 3F ) . These results indicate that also on WIP D ABD mutant B cells , the reduced CD81 levels correlated with an increase in the more mobile population of CD19 mole - cules , likely leading to a misplacement of the co - receptor and re - sulting in impaired signaling . Binding of WIP to Actin Affects B Cell Chemotaxis Cytoskeletal integrity is crucial for B cell migration and chemo - taxis . Having observed a slightly hampered reconstitution ca - pacity of WIP D ABD mutant BM in chimeric mice ( Figures S1A and S1D ) , we went on to investigate signaling after CXCR4 stimulation . First , we determined that surface expression of CXCR4 was similar on WIP D ABD mutant and WT B cells ( Fig - ure 4A ) . Next , we stimulated WIP D ABD mutant and WT B cells with the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 and analyzed the phosphoryla - tion of Akt and Erk by immunoblot . WIP D ABD mutant B cells showed consistently diminished phosphorylation of Akt and Erk compared to WT B cells ( Figure 4B ) . We next evaluated the B cell chemotactic response to the che - mokine CXCL12 in vitro using transwell plates . WIP D ABD mutant B cells displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of migratory B cells to CXCL12 compared to WT cells ( Figure 4C ) . 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 50 0 100 CD19 N o r m a li z ed v a l ue ( % o f M a x ) dABDWT E 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 50 0 100 CD81 N o r m a li z ed v a l ue ( % o f M a x ) dABDWT A fast diffusing population pe r c en t age 0 80 40 WT dABD D P e r c en t 10 - 5 10 - 2 10 - 3 10 - 4 30 15 0 10 - 1 10 - 0 D ( µ m 2 / s ) P e r c en t 10 - 5 10 - 2 10 - 3 10 - 4 30 15 0 10 - 1 10 - 0 D ( µ m 2 / s ) C WT P e r c en t 10 - 5 10 - 2 10 - 3 10 - 4 30 15 0 10 - 1 10 - 0 D ( µ m 2 / s ) overlay Diffusion of CD19 D ( µ m 2 / s ) 0 . 009 0 0 . 025 0 . 05 0 . 5 0 . 05 WT 0 . 012 dABD CD 19 ( geo m e t r i c M F I ) 0 6000 10000 2000 ns CD 81 ( geo m e t r i c M F I ) 0 1500 2500 500 p = 0 , 47 F B WT WIPdABD dABD dABDWT Figure 3 .

For this , ﬂuorescently labeled WT and WIP D ABD mutant B cells were adoptively transferred into WT recipients . Af - ter 24 hr , both cell types were found in explanted popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes using two - photon microscopy . Although WT B cells moved with an average speed of 5 . 2 ± 0 . 076 m m / min , WIP D ABD mutant B cells were signiﬁcantly slower at 4 . 4 ± 0 . 173 m m / min ( Figure 4D ; Video S2 ) . In addition , WIP D ABD mutant B cells showed about 20 % less displacement during the acquisition period compared to WT cells , thus indicating a reduced steady - state migration of these cells . Altogether , these results demonstrated that the absence of WIP binding to actin inﬂuences B cell migration and actin polar - ization , likely affecting B cell function . Defective Polarization and HS1 Accumulation in B Cells Lacking Binding of WIP to Actin Having observed a reduced chemotaxis and diminished PI3K signaling after CXCL12 stimulation in vitro , we next investigated actin polarization of WIP D ABD mutant B cells upon chemokine stimulation . For this , cells were spread on nonactivating cover - slips , stimulated with CXCL12 , ﬁxed , stained for F - actin by phal - loidin , and imaged using SIM . After 3 min of stimulation , WT B cells showed lamellipodia formation as polarized F - actin struc - tures ( Figure 5A ; Figure S3A ) . In contrast , both Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and WIP D ABD mutant B cells failed to polarize F - actin after CXCL12 stimulation , indicated as the percentage polarized cells to total cells ( Figures 5A – 5D ) . This defect in actin polarization de - pended on the strength of the stimulus , because stimulation with a higher dose of CXCL12 led to more polarized WIP D ABD mutant B cells , but not Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells ( compare Figure 5B [ 500 ng / mL ] to Figure 5C [ 200 ng / mL ] ) . WIP has been shown to interact with cortactin , an actin bind - ing protein that promotes actin polymerization by stabilizing branched actin ﬁlaments ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , in a yeast - two hybrid screen ( Kinley et al . , 2003 ) . We thus went on to investigate whether HS1 , the hematopoietic homolog of cortactin , localizes to actin - rich structures after CXCR4 activation in B cells . SIM im - aging of CXCL12 - stimulated WT cells revealed an increase in HS1 phosphorylation , as well as accumulation of activated HS1 in areas of polarized actin , 3 min after activation , as indi - cated by the increase in MFI of p - HS1 in WT cells ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Concomitantly to the reduced ability of Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and WIP D ABD mutant B cells to polarize F - actin after CXCL12 stimulation , both cell types showed reduced phosphorylation and polarization of HS1 ( Figure 5A ; Figure S3C ) , as detected by SIM imaging . MFI analysis of p - HS1 staining per cell conﬁrmed a diminished overall phosphorylation of HS1 in Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and WIP D ABD mutant B cells compared to WT cells 3 min after CXCL12 stimulation ( Figure 5E ; Figure S3D ) . Similarly , phosphorylation levels of HS1 were reduced after stimulation of WIP D ABD mutant B cells with CXCL12 or BCR , as detected by immunoblot ( Figure 5G ; Figure S3F ) .

From these data , we conclude that the binding of WIP to actin is necessary for actin polarization after CXCL12 stimulation . Furthermore , phosphorylation and po - larization of HS1 is reduced in WIP D ABD mutant B cells , likely indicating a crucial role for the binding of WIP to actin in regu - lating HS1 activation and hence B cell chemotaxis . DISCUSSION The results presented in this study elucidated a crucial role of the binding of WIP to actin for B cell function . Immunizing mixed BM chimeras revealed that in the absence of WIP binding to actin , B cells are less efﬁcient at differentiating into GC B cells in a competitive environment . However , in a noncompetitive environ - ment , GC responses are comparable to WT cells but are impaired in producing high - afﬁnity antibodies . These results suggest a crucial role of WIP binding to actin during B cell differ - entiation and antibody production . B cells deﬁcient for WASp mount a normal antibody response to T - dependent immuniza - tion ( Recher et al . , 2012 ; Snapper et al . , 1998 ) . This can be partly explained by compensatory effects of the ubiquitously ex - pressed protein N - WASp ( Westerberg et al . , 2012 ) , because mice lacking both WASp and N - WASp in B cells have impaired responses to T cell - dependent antigens ( Volpi et al . , 2016 ) . Considering our previously published data , we now suggest that in Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells , the lack of differentiation into GC cells and antibody production can be attributed to the strongly A phalloidin p - HS1 merge WT Wipf1 - / - dABD 80 0 Wipf1 - / - WT 40 dABD polarized cells ( % ) 80000 0 Wipf1 - / - WT 40000 dABD p - HS1 in polarized area * * * * * * * B P o l a r i z ed c e ll s t o t oa l c e ll s ( % ) I n t D en o f p H S 1 i n po l a r i z ed a r ea 8000 0 Wipf1 - / - WT 4000 M F I o f p H S 1 pe r c e ll CXCL12 ( 500ng / ml ) 15 0 Wipf1 - / - WT dABD polarized area po l a r i z ed a r ea ( µ m 2 ) 10 5 D F E dABD * * * * * * * * 80 0 Wipf1 - / - WT 40 dABD polarized cells ( % ) C P o l a r i z ed c e ll s t o t oa l c e ll s ( % ) CXCL12 ( 200ng / ml ) CXCL12 stimulation tubulin p - HS1 0 Time ( min ) 1 10 0 1 10 WT dABD G tubulin total HS1 W T d A B D N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y Time ( min ) p - HS1 0 3 10 0 3 10 Figure 5 .

Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 625 reduced PI3K signaling and resulting defects in survival and dif - ferentiation due to the absence of both WIP and WASp . In contrast , B cells lacking the ABD of WIP are less ﬁt to enter the GC response in a competitive environment and demonstrate enhanced class - switched recombination but reduced antibody afﬁnity maturation . Findings demonstrate that clonal expansion of high - afﬁnity B cells in GCs depends on the degradation of IRF4 in light zone B cells ( Li et al . , 2018 ) . We found that WIP D ABD B cells preferentially differentiate into antigen - speciﬁc , IRF4 - ex - pressing , IgG1 - high B cells in vivo . We speculate that these cells could be plasma cells that , because of enhanced IRF4 levels , prematurely exit the GC reaction , having undergone less afﬁnity maturation , and secrete increased levels of IgG1 in the serum . How the binding of WIP to actin regulates IRF4 expression levels remains to be investigated . One of the reasons for the observed altered antibody response in WIP D ABD mice could be the reduced PI3K signaling we de - tected after BCR stimulation . In Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells , we have previ - ously demonstrated a severe defect in PI3K signaling after trig - gering the BCR but also other receptors ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) . We show here that WIP D ABD B cells demonstrate less severe defects in signaling after BCR or CXCR4 stimulation compared to Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) B cells . Phosphorylation of CD19 is reduced in both Wipf1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and WIP D ABD B cells . These results indicate that despite less severe signaling defects in WIP D ABD B cells , CD19 phosphorylation depends on WIP binding to actin . We and others have shown that the small Rho guanosine tri - phosphatases ( GTPases ) Cdc42 , a known regulator of actin re - modeling and interaction partner of WASp and N - WASp , and to a lesser extent TC10 control GC formation and antibody pro - duction in B cells ( Burbage et al . , 2015 , 2017 ; Gerasimcik et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , the lack of the adaptor protein and known interaction partner of WIP , WASP , and Cdc42 Intersectin2 demonstrated reduced antigen afﬁnity maturation after vaccina - tion ( Burbage et al . , 2018 ) . Together with the ﬁndings presented here , these results point at a central function of actin regulators in inﬂuencing humoral immune responses . A comparison of the B cell functions dependent on WIP or the binding of WIP to actin is shown in Table S1 . In the absence of WIP , and hence WASp , we have demon - strated that antigen - induced B cell synapses showed a loss of actin foci ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) . Similar F - actin foci were described as being a WASp - generated fraction of the total syn - aptic F - actin in T cells ( Kumari et al . , 2015 ) . The results presented here revealed that although overall F - actin levels in resting WT and WIP D ABD mutant B cells were similar , WIP D ABD mutant B cells were less able to form F - actin foci after BCR stimulation or polarization of F - actin after triggering the chemokine receptor CXCR4 . In line with this , T cells from WIP D ABD mutant mice were impaired in their capacity to spread over anti - CD3 - coated coverslips ( Massaad et al . , 2014 ) . Altogether , these ﬁndings indicate that the binding of WIP to actin is necessary for actin polymerization after BCR and chemokine receptor stimulation , especially in situations that require active actin reorganization of the cells . We previously demonstrated that in the absence of WIP , the actin cytoskeleton , as well as the CD81 tetraspanin network , was disturbed , leading to increased diffusion of CD19 on resting B cells and resulting in impaired PI3K signaling ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) . Employing SPT to study CD19 diffusion on the resting WIP D ABD mutant B cell surface , we here surprisingly found a fraction of CD19 molecules to be highly mobile , although the overall CD19 diffusion was similar to WT B cells . This increased CD19 diffusion correlated with reduced expression of the tetra - spanin molecule CD81 on WIP D ABD mutant B cells . These re - sults point at a function of WIP binding to actin in stabilizing the tetraspanin molecule CD81 , thereby regulating CD19 diffu - sion . How these subtle changes in the actin cytoskeleton through the binding of WIP to actin inﬂuence the plasma mem - brane expression of CD81 remains to be investigated . A higher mobility of a fraction of CD19 molecules , as well as reduced actin polymerization , might be the underlying mechanism for reduced PI3K signaling of WIP D ABD mutant B cells after triggering the BCR or CXCR4 . The polymerization of actin after the initial recep - tor - mediated depolymerization occurs at BCR microclusters and is needed to stabilize BCR molecules close CD19 molecules ( Kla¨sener et al . , 2014 ) . The formation , integrity , and proximal signaling events of these microclusters depend on the actin cytoskeleton ( Treanor et al . , 2011 ) . Altered receptor dynamics , such as seen in the absence of WIP or WIP binding to actin , might hamper receptor crosstalk and limit CD19 in its function in PI3K signaling . Analyzing the reconstitution capacity of WIP D ABD mutant BM , we found reduced reconstitution of B cells in the BM of recipient mice , similar to what we have described with BM from WIP - deﬁ - cient mice . Furthermore , we demonstrated here that WIP D ABD mutant B cells showed reduced homeostatic displacement in peripheral lymphoid organs in vivo and reduced chemotaxis toward CXCL12 in vitro . Concomitantly , PI3K signaling was impaired in WIP D ABD mutant B cells after triggering CXCR4 . Similarly , T cells lacking the ABD of WIP displayed decreased cellular F - actin content , impaired chemotaxis , and defective homing to lymph nodes despite having normal WASp expression ( Massaad et al . , 2014 ) . Further to our ﬁnding that an immobile co - receptor CD19 is necessary for PI3K signaling and chemotaxis ( Keppler et al . , 2015 ) , it has been proposed that CXCR4 signaling in B cells requires the expression of the BCR and that triggering CD19 can overcome this need ( Becker et al . , 2017 ) . We here show that even small alterations in the mobile fraction of CD19 triggered by the absence of WIP binding to actin can lead to reduced PI3K signaling and chemotaxis of B cells , demon - strating once more the crucial role of CD19 and the actin cyto - skeleton in regulating B cell chemotactic responses . Branched actin networks in lymphocytes are not only regu - lated by the WASp family of actin regulators but also by HS1 . HS1 stabilizes the ARP2 / 3 complex against debranching ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) and interacts with WASp and WIP in den - dritic cells to ensure chemotaxis ( Dehring et al . , 2011 ; Kinley et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , HS1 is essential for T cell receptor ( TCR ) synapse formation ( Gomez et al . , 2006 ) . HS1 is phosphor - ylated after BCR stimulation and is required for B cell responses to antigens ( Taniuchi et al . , 1995 ) . However , the role of HS1 in B cell chemotaxis is unknown so far . Here , by using SIM , we demonstrated that HS1 is polarized to F - actin - rich structures af - ter CXCL12 stimulation . In the absence of WIP or WIP binding to actin , B cells failed to polarize F - actin or HS1 in response to 626 Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 CXCL12 . We thus hypothesize that to migrate toward a chemo - kine gradient , B cells require WIP binding to actin for stabilization of branched actin ﬁlaments by HS1 . This might be a direct effect of WIP recruiting active p - HS1 or leading to the activation of HS1 or , alternatively , an indirect activation through actin . Besides stabilizing WASp and binding to F - actin ﬁlaments , WIP associates with the adaptor molecules Nck , Grb2 , and DOCK8 , thus linking the actin network to signaling cascades ( An - to´n et al . , 1998 ; Barda - Saad et al . , 2005 ; Donnelly et al . , 2013 ; Janssen et al . , 2016 ; Moreau et al . , 2000 ) . We here extend this view of WIP as an organizer of signaling platforms by proposing a model in which WIP is essential for maintaining actin cytoskel - eton integrity and promoting migration : it stabilizes WASp and stabilizes newly synthesized actin ﬁlaments by recruiting or acti - vating HS1 . A better understanding of these processes will help modulate actin cytoskeletal functions with the aim of preventing or improving disease .

The glass coverslips for TIRF microscopy were cleaned in chromosulfuric acid ( VWR ) , coated with 1 m g / mL of anti - major histocompatibility complex class II ( anti - MHC class II ) ( M5 / 114 , ATCC TIB120 ) for nonstimulatory coating for 1 . 5 hr , and washed with PBS . TIRFimageswere acquired withanelectronmultiplying charge - coupledde - vice ( EMCCD ) camera ( iXon3 897 , Andor ) coupled to a TIRF microscopy sys - tem ( Cell R , Olympus ) with 488 - , 561 - , and 640 - nm lasers ( Olympus ) and a motorized ﬁlter wheel ( Olympus ) . Single - molecule imaging was performed aspreviouslydescribedwith20frames / sfor15susinga150 3 numericalaper - ture ( NA ) 1 . 45objective ( Olympus ) .

SPT data were analyzed in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) , and population analysis was performed as previously described ( Mattila et al . , 2013 ; Treanor et al . , 2010 ) . SIM SIM was performed on an Elyra PS . 1 microscope ( Zeiss ) using 488 - and 640 - nm laser excitation and a 63 3 / 1 . 40 Plan Apochromat oil - immersion objective ( Zeiss ) . Imaging was started 20 min after placing the dish on the mi - croscope to prevent artifacts due to sample drift . Two - color alignment was performed after each experiment day using a multicolor bead sample ( Zeiss ) and the channel alignment function in the Zen software ( Zeiss ) . Images were reconstructed in the Zen software using a theoretical point - spread function and the auto - noise ﬁlter setting . For spreading analysis , primary puriﬁed B cells were settled on coverslips coated with anti - k - chain antibody at 37 (cid:3) C . After 10 min , cells were ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with PBS 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . F - actin foci were calculated using the Analyze Particles plugin of ImageJ . For chemotactic F - actin polarization assays , primary puriﬁed B cells were settled on coverslips coated with poly - L - lysin at 37 (cid:3) C . After 10 min , CXCL12 was added to the cells at the indicated concentrations . After 3 min of stimula - tion , cells were ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with PBS 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( Molecular Cell Reports 24 , 619 – 629 , July 17 , 2018 627 Probes ) and p - HS1 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , followed by secondary anti - body staining ( anti - rabbit Alexa 555 , Molecular Probes ) .
