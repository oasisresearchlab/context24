It is involved in a diverse array of basic cellular functions . Tumorigenesis and tumor progression involves alterations in actin cytoskeleton proteins . We sought to study the role of cortactin in melanocytic tumor progression using immunohistochemistry on human tissues . The results reveal quantitative differences between benign and malignant lesions . Significantly higher cortactin expression is found in melanomas than in nevi ( P o 0 . 0001 ) , with levels greater in metastatic than in invasive melanomas ( P o 0 . 05 ) . Qualitatively , tumor tissues often show aberrant cortactin localization at the cell periphery , corresponding to its colocalization with filamentous actin in cell cortex of cultured melanoma cells . This suggests an additional level of protein dysregulation . Furthermore , in patients with metastatic disease , high - level cortactin expression correlates with poor disease - specific survival . Our data , in conjunction with outcome data on several other types of human cancers and experimental data from melanoma cell lines , supports a potential role of aberrant cortactin expression in melanoma tumor progression and a rational for targeting key elements of actin - signaling pathway for developmental therapeutics in melanomas .

Both invasive melanomas and benign compound or dermal nevi are proliferations of melanocytic cells in the dermis . In contrast to nevus cells , melanoma cells show cytologic atypia , an escape from cell cycle arrest and aberrant interaction with the dermal environment manifested by a lack of progressive maturation , expansile cellular growth and a variable host immune response . 1 , 2 Tumorigenic invasive tumor cells acquire the capacity to migrate , breach into lymphovascular circulation and survive in remote body sites . Active remodeling of a cell’s actin cytoskeleton is essential for tumor cell inva - sion and metastasis . 3 Altered expression of compo - nents of the actin cytoskeleton can also contribute to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis . 4 Received 16 March 2009 ; revised 19 July 2009 ; accepted 20 July 2009 ; published online 6 November 2009 Correspondence : Dr H Wu , Department of Pathology , Fox Chase Cancer Center , 333 Cottman Avenue , Philadelphia , PA 19111 , USA .

Cortactin is a multidomain actin - binding and adaptor / scaffolding protein that is involved in a wide range of cellular functions , including endocy - tosis , cell migration , invasion , adhesion and neural synaptic organization ( reviewed in 5 – 8 ) . The N - termi - nus of the protein contains domains that bind to filamentous ( F - ) actin and Arp2 / 3 complex , a key machinery in formations of branched actin network that is required for breaking down of pre - existing and establishment of new membrane - cytoskeleton structures . 9 The C - terminus contains a proline - rich region with sites of serine , threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation , and an SH3 domain that interacts with a variety of cellular proteins , including regulators of actin nucleation ( N - WASP and WIP ) , endocytosis ( dynamin , Hip1R and CD2AP ) and scaffolding ( Shanks ) . The gene encoding human cortactin ( CTTN ) is a key component of the 11q13 amplicon , a chromosomal region frequently ampli - fied in a subset of human breast , head and neck , hepatocellular and bladder carcinomas . Clinical correlative studies have identified CTTN gene amplification and corresponding protein overex - pression to be associated with poor clinical out - come , presumably by the enhancement of tumor cell movement and metastasis . 10 – 12 A study using a human melanoma cell line A375 shows that cortactin is required for the formation of invadopodia . 13 In murine melanoma cell lines , cortactin is the only phosphoprotein that demon - strates overexpression , hyperphosphorylation in tyrosine as well as colocalization with tyrosine kinase Fyn in cells with high metastatic potential . 14 Characteristics of the protein identified in other cell types also make it a particularly promising molecule to study in melanoma tumorigenesis . The aim of this study is to evaluate cortactin expression and gene amplification in human melanocytic lesions . Materials and methods Cell Lines and Cell Culture Human melanoma cell lines ( 1205Lu , WM9 and WM1158 ) kindly provided by Dr M Herlyn ( Wistar Institute , Philadelphia , PA ) were grown in ‘2 % tumor’ media with 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 5 m g / ml insulin as previously described . 15 For serum ( 20 % FBS ) stimulation experiments , FBS and insulin were omitted from the medium ( factor - free medium ) . Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence Immunohistochemistry staining using specific anti - cortactin monoclonal antibody 4F11 ( Millipore , Billerica , MA and a kind gift from Dr Weed ) were performed on tissue microarrays containing 0 . 9 mm cores of 77 nevi , 8 in - situ , 50 invasive and 103 metastatic malignant melanomas constructed as previously described with minor modifications . 16 Each tissue microarray also contained control normal and tumor tissue from other organs . Indivi - dual sections of nevi ( 6 banal nevi , 10 dysplastic nevi ) , 1 in - situ , 19 invasive and 3 metastatic melanomas were also used . In addition , a subset of tumors ( 17 invasive and 2 metastatic ) and nevi ( 14 banal nevi ) was also analyzed as cores in TMAs as well as individual sections . The tissue was fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin . The use of tissue followed the guideline of an IRB - approved protocol . Deparaffinization , rehydration , antigen retrieval , primary and secondary antibody reaction and detection by diaminobenzidine were all performed on automated Benchmark XT ( Venta - na Medical Systems , Tucson , AZ ) following the manufacture’s protocols . The staining was quanti - tated using Automated Cellular Imaging System ( ACISII , Chromavision , San Juan Capistrano , CA ) . Each slide was scanned at 10 (cid:2) magnification . Threshold values were adjusted so that the areas with either any appreciable positive staining ( ‘im - munopositivity’ ) or very dark staining ( ‘strong immunopositivity’ ) were masked as brown pixels . The blue pixels correlated with areas of counter - stain . The percentage value for immunohistochem - istry represents the brown area divided by the sum of the brown and blue areas . The intensity of a selected area was the average integrated optical density of the brown in the thresholded brown area , calculated by the system’s software . A few cases with significant melanin pigment were discarded from the analysis , and not included in the total numbers of cases stained . To target immunopositiv - ity in relevant lesional cells , on average 3 or 8 representative 400 (cid:2) fields were selected for a tissue microarray core or an individual section , respec - tively . Immunopositivity is reported as the multi - plication between staining intensity and the percentage of positive staining . 17 Each case was assigned the highest immunopositivity among the replicate cores . 18 For immunofluorescent micro - scopy , the cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed and stained using anti - cortactin ( 4F11 ) as previously reported 19 with minor modifications . Filamentous - actin was detected using rhodamine - labeled phalloidin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . Fluorescence In - Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) Two P1 genomic cortactin clones 20 were labeled by nick translation with SpectrumRed conjugated dUTP ( Nick - Translation DNA Kit , Abbott Molecular , Abbott Park , IL ) . Dual - color FISH assays were performed on blank sections of TMAs using a mixture of the SpectrumRed CTTN probe and the Cortactin in human melanomas 188 X - Z Xu et al Modern Pathology ( 2010 ) 23 , 187 – 196 SpectrumGreen CEP11 commercial probe ( Abbott Molecular ) according to protocol previously pub - lished . 21 At least 50 nuclei were scored for each core within the selected histological lesion . Based on the percentage of cells with r 2 , 3 or Z 4 copies of CTTN , 3 categories of FISH patterns were defined as follows : ( a ) no genomic gain ( r 40 % of cells with Z 3 copies of CTTN ) ; ( b ) low genomic gain ( Z 40 % cells with 3 copies and / or 10 to o 40 % cells with Z 4 copies of CTTN ) ; ( c ) high level of genomic gain ( Z 40 % of cells with Z 4 copies of CTTN ) . CTTN gene amplification was defined as either the ratio CTTN / CEP11 Z 2 , or presence of clusters ( Z 4 signals ) of CTTN in Z 10 % of scored cells . CTTN gene amplification was categorized as high level of genomic gain . Statistical Analysis The association between CTTN genomic status ( no gain , low level or high level gain ) detected by FISH and lesion types was tested via Chi - square test . The correlation of the CTTN genomic status with im - munohistochemistry ( immunopositivity and very strong immunopositivity ) scores was calculated by spearman correlation coefficient . Immunohistochem - istry scores were compared across lesional types using Wilcoxon test . For patients with invasive tumor , immunohistochemistry scores were compared between metastatic status ( yes vs no ) via Wilcoxon test . For patients with metastasis , immunohistochem - istry scores were compared across tissue types ( lung , lymph node or skin metastases ) via Wilcoxon test . Paired two - sample t - test was used to compare immunohistochemistry scores in metastases at differ - ent times from the same patient . Overall survival and disease - specific survival were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard model for patients with metas - tasis . An immunohistochemistry score of 63 was found as a significant cut - off in predicting disease - specific survival in metastases via PARTY Package in R , version 2 . 6 . 2 . A statistical significant cutoff of 0 . 05 was used . All analyses were done by SAS software , version 9 . 1 ; except otherwise mentioned . Results Cortactin Over - Expression Correlates with Melanocytic Tumor Progression Immunohistochemical staining using a specific anti - cortactin monoclonal antibody was performed on human melanocytic lesions from tissue microarrays and individual sections , including 83 nevi , 10 dysplastic nevi , 9 in - situ , 69 invasive and 106 metastatic melanomas . There was a significant difference in the level of cortactin protein expres - sion in benign vs malignant lesions . Most benign nevi had minimal ( Figure 1c ) or focal weak immunostaining ( Figure 1d ) . Occasional nevi had focal moderate immunostaining ( Figure 1e ) , and the intensity tended to diminish with maturation upon dermal descent . In contrast , most samples of melanoma had diffuse and intense immunostaining ( Figure 2a – f ) . In a few cases of tumor with paradoxical maturation , 22 the smaller cells had less intensity . The quantitative immunopositivity was significantly different between the benign ( nevi ) and malignant ( in - situ , invasive and metastatic melano - mas ) lesions ( P o 0 . 0001 ) . Invasive and metastatic tumors both showed significantly higher level of expression than nevi ( P o 0 . 0001 for both ) ( Figure 3a ) . 74 and 85 % of invasive and metastatic melanomas , respectively , had cortactin expression levels that exceeded the 95th percentile found in nevi . Furthermore , metastatic melanomas had a significantly higher immunopositivity than invasive tumors ( P ¼ 0 . 02 ) . Interestingly , within the nevi , the immunopositivity was higher in dysplastic than in banal nevi ( P ¼ 0 . 04 ) . The staining intensity was also quantified to identify which lesions contained very strong immunopositivity . As shown in Figure 3b , only melanomas were very strongly positive for cortactin immunostaining , with a highly significant difference compared to nevi ( P o 0 . 0001 ) . Within the tumors , metastatic melanomas had higher values than invasive tumors ( P ¼ 0 . 0008 ) . To further demonstrate the increased expression of cortactin in melanoma tissues using a different methodology , equal amount of total protein extracted from sections of nevi and melanomas were analyzed using anti - cortactin immunoblotting . The signal of cortactin protein ( seen as intact p80 / 85 , and its major breakdown product ) was significantly higher in melanoma samples ( data not shown ) . The abnormality in cortactin expression was not limited to the intensity , as different distribution patterns were seen in nevi and melanomas . As shown in Figure 1d and e , in nevi , the weak staining was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm . In contrast , in most melanomas the strong staining was accentuated in the cell periphery ( Figure 2a , c , d and f ) , similar to the distribution of cortactin in the membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in cultured melanoma cells ( Figure 3a , b and d ) and other cultured cell types . 19 A few tumors also showed an abnormal dot - like distribution ( Figure 2e ) , reminiscent of cortactin localization in podosomes of src - transformed cells . 23 We hypothe - size that the altered subcellular localization may reflect an additional mechanism for protein dysregu - lation during tumorigenesis , in addition to upregula - tion of the level of protein expression . Cortactin Co - Localizes with F - Actin and Displays a Distinctive Distribution in Human Melanoma Cells To determine the localization of cortactin in mela - noma cells , immunofluorescent staining was per - formed on cultured human melanoma cell lines . In addition to the pool of protein in the perinuclear Cortactin in human melanomas X - Z Xu et al 189 Modern Pathology ( 2010 ) 23 , 187 – 196 area without co - localization with F - actin in the cell cortex , presumably in association with the Golgi complex , 24 there was a prominent cell border distribution . The staining in the cell cortex and leading edge of the cells co - localized with F - actin ( Figure 4a and b ) . Serum - starved melanoma cells showed diminished cell cortex localization ( Figure 4c ) , likely due to inactivation of the small GTPase Rac1 . 25 After serum stimulation , cortactin redistrib - uted to the membrane ruffles , co - localizing with F - actin ( Figure 4d ) . Since most of the cellular func - tions involving cortactin occur in the cell cortex , these findings suggest that the subcellular localiza - tion of cortactin may be another important aspect of altered protein regulation in the tumor cells . Cortactin Gene Amplification is Uncommon in Melanocytic Tumors Since CTTN gene amplification is a major mechan - ism for protein overexpression in breast and head and neck carcinomas , FISH analyses were per - formed on the TMAs to look for CTTN gene copy numbers in nevi and melanomas . No gene amplifi - cation was found in 87 nevi analyzed ( Figure 5a ) . CTTN gene amplification was present in six of 160 melanomas tested ( 3 . 75 % ) : 1 of 46 invasive , 5 of 96 metastatic , and 0 of 18 in - situ tumors . In all six cases , the gene amplification was seen as small clusters of CTTN signal in the nuclei , and the tumors showed corresponding high - level cortactin protein expression ( Figure 5e and f ) . However , overall the correlation between CTTN copy number and immunopositivity was not statistically signifi - cant ( P ¼ 0 . 18 ) . These results suggest that CTTN amplification does not play a major role in aberrant cortactin protein overexpression in melanoma . In many tumors with CTTN genomic gain , this gene was not classified as amplified because of concomitant increased signals of CEP11 . Never - theless , this may be a reflection of genomic altera - tion of the tumors . As shown in Table 1 , there was a progressive aneuploidy from in - situ to invasive and Figure 1 Immunohistochemical staining of cortactin in human melanocytic tumors : example cores in tissue microarrays ( a - nevus , b - metastatic melanoma ) .

Eighty - seven patients with metastatic tumors had clinical followup . They were 51 male and 36 female ; aged 27 – 94 years ( mean 63 , median 64 ) . As shown in Figure 3c , patients with metastatic tumors that had high levels of cortactin expression ( immunopo - sitivity score 4 63 ) were more likely to die from their disease ( hazard ratio ¼ 3 . 3 , P o 0 . 0001 , 95 % confi - dence interval 1 . 8 – 6 . 0 ) . Several other comparisons showed a trend , how - ever did not achieve statistically significant P - values . Invasive melanomas with subsequent metastasis ( n ¼ 27 ) , compared with the ones without metastasis ( n ¼ 42 ) , tended to have higher values of immunopositivity and very strong immunopositiv - ity by univariant analysis ( P ¼ 0 . 087 and 0 . 156 , respectively ) . For patients ( n ¼ 9 ) who had two metastases at different time points , the immunopo - sitivity and very strong immunopositivity scores tended to be higher in the later metastases ( P ¼ 0 . 22 and 0 . 17 , respectively ) . There was also a trend of higher immunopositivity and very strong immuno - positivity values in metastases to the lung , com - Figure 3 ( a and b ) Comparison of cortactin expression in nevi , dysplastic nevi ( CDN ) , melanoma in - situ ( MIS ) , invasive and metastatic melanomas .

Discussion In this report , we have shown that cortactin protein expression is significantly increased in malignant melanomas . The aberrant distribution pattern seen in the tumor tissues corresponds to the localization of the protein in the cell cortex and leading edges of cultured melanoma cells . Increased cortactin ex - pression correlates with disease progression ( meta - static tumors had higher level of expression than invasive tumors ) . Moreover , high - level cortactin expression in metastatic tumors correlates with poor disease - specific survival . These observations in hu - man tissues support the hypothesis generated from experimental data 13 , 14 that cortactin is important in melanoma tumor progression , and provides a ra - tional for potential development of new prognostic biomarkers and targeted therapies . The importance of cortactin in tumor cell biology is supported by what we know of its basic biochemical and cellular functions . The multido - main structure of cortactin makes it an ideal adaptor as well as a scaffolding protein in regulating the formation and stabilization of nascent branched actin networks , a key process in the remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton that is required for a wide variety of cellular functions . 9 Cortactin has been shown to be an important component in the Figure 4 Immunofluorescent staining with anti - cortactin Ab 4F11 ( green ) and F - actin ( phalloidin , red ) showed cortactin colocalization with F - actin in the advancing leading edges ( yellow , arrows ) in melanoma cell lines WM9 ( a ) and WM11158 ( b ) . The same markers showed re - distribution of cortactin to the membrane ruffles ( arrows ) , colocalizing with F - actin ( yellow ) in melanoma cell line 1205Lu after serum stimulation ( d ) . Control serum - starved 1205Lu cell ( c ) . Cortactin in human melanomas X - Z Xu et al 193 Modern Pathology ( 2010 ) 23 , 187 – 196 subcellular structures involved in cell motility ( lamellapodia , filapodia and membrane ruffles ) , extracellular matrix anchorage , degradation and cell invasion ( osteoclast podosomes , tumor cell podo - somes and invadopodia ) and receptor trafficking ( endocytic vesicles and receptor stimulated dorsal ‘waves’ ) ( reviewed in refs . 5 , 6 , 26 ) . Aberrant cortac - tin expression in melanoma cells may lead to increased sensitivity to extracellular chemotactic signals . Cortactin showed translocation to the cell cortex upon serum stimulation . Serum and growth factors known to regulate melanocyte proliferation ( bFGF , PDGF , pleiotrophin ) 16 , 27 increased phosphor - ylation of cortactin on Src targeted residue Y421 . In melanoma cell line 1205Lu , cortactin was associated with src protein kinase and N - cadherin ( Xu & Wu , unpublished data ) . The aberrant cortactin over - expression may result in increased sensitivity of melanocytic cells to the stimulation of growth factors in the epidermal and dermal environment , thus potentially contributing to the exit from cell cycle arrest , and to phenotypic transformation of the tumor cells by decreasing their dependence on extracellular growth and chemotactic molecules . 28 Increased cortactin expression may also contribute to melanoma cell phenotypic transformation that is analogous to epithelium - mesenchymal transition . In normal adult human tissue , cortactin is highly expressed in tissue and cell types with actin - based contractile ability , such as smooth muscle cells and myoepithelial cells . 29 Nevic cells are for the most part , static cells whose actin cytoskeleton is likely to be rigid and stable with a purpose of providing structural support . We propose that acquisition of increased levels of cortactin , a protein normally involved in active cell shape remodeling , cell migration and rapid response to environmental stimuli , will contribute to a more motile and invasive cellular phenotype . CTTN gene amplifica - tion was not a common event in melanomas , similar to adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland , but different from breast and head and neck carcinomas where protein overexpression is com - monly associated with gene amplification . 7 , 11 , 30 The mechanism ( s ) for protein overexpression in mela - nomas remains to be determined , may be due to higher mRNA level or increased protein stability . 30 Components of the actin cytoskeleton have been proposed as targets for cancer drug development . 31 Animal models to study tumor metastasis using breast , squamous or hepatocellular carcinoma cells have demonstrated that overexpression of cortactin lead to increased in vivo metastases ( reviewed in Figure 5 FISH analysis ( a , c and e ) and immunohistochemical staining ( b , d , and f ) of the same samples in a nevus ( a and b ) , and melanomas without ( c and d ) and with ( e and f ) CTTN amplification .

In a breast cancer cell line , a cell - permeable peptide as well as a small - molecule compound that can inhibit cortactin binding to a partner protein AMAP1 effectively inhibits tumor cell invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo . This peptide can also inhibit in vitro invasion of glioblastoma and lung tumor cells lines . 32 These studies , taken together with our results , indicate the potential of cortactin as an interesting biomarker for mela - noma prognostication and a target for therapeutic development .
