Actin interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ) is a con - served component of the actin cytoskeleton ﬁrst identi - ﬁed in a two - hybrid screen against yeast actin . Here , we report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous ac - tin depolymerizing factor coﬁlin . A two - hybrid – based approach using coﬁlin and actin mutants identiﬁed resi - dues necessary for the interaction of actin , coﬁlin , and Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex . Deletion of the AIP1 gene is lethal in combination with coﬁlin mutants or act1 - 159 , an actin mutation that slows the rate of ac - tin ﬁlament disassembly in vivo . Aip1p localizes to cor - tical actin patches in yeast cells , and this localization is disrupted by speciﬁc actin and coﬁlin mutations . Fur - ther , Aip1p is required to restrict coﬁlin localization to cortical patches . Finally , biochemical analyses show that Aip1p causes net depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments only in the presence of coﬁlin and that coﬁlin enhances binding of Aip1p to actin ﬁlaments . We conclude that Aip1p is a coﬁlin - associated protein that enhances the ﬁlament disassembly activity of coﬁlin and restricts coﬁ - lin localization to cortical actin patches . Key words : Aip1 • coﬁlin •actin • cytoskeleton • Sac - charomyces cerevisiae T HE actin cytoskeleton plays diverse roles in the cell , mediating such processes as endocytosis , exocytosis , cell motility , cell polarity , and cytokinesis in a spa - tially and temporally controlled manner . Each of these processes requires the regulation of specific dynamic prop - erties and spatial organization of actin filaments by a sub - set of a large collection of actin - binding proteins . To deter - mine how actin and associated proteins function together to control morphogenetic events , it will be important to determine how actin - associated proteins are sorted to dif - ferent structures of the cytoskeleton , and how the com - bined actions of different actin - associated proteins affect cytoskeleton dynamics in these different structures . Saccharomyces cerevisiae presents excellent opportuni - ties for the study of combined effects of actin - associated proteins on actin assembly and organization both in vivo and in vitro . The actin cytoskeleton of S . cerevisiae is orga - nized into polarized cortical patches and cytoplasmic bun - dles of actin filaments aligned along the mother – daughter cell axis ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Amberg , 1998 ) . Little is known about how actin - binding proteins are sorted be - tween different compartments of the cytoskeleton , or whether they themselves are responsible for forming these specialized actin networks . We previously described a two - hybrid approach for characterizing interactions of actin - binding proteins with yeast actin ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ) . We used this system to identify yeast actin – associated proteins and examined their ability to interact with 35 clustered - charged - to - ala - nine mutants of actin . Those mutations that disrupt the binding of a particular ligand can identify regions of the actin surface important for a given interaction and can de - lineate an interaction footprint when displayed on the structure of actin . Actin interacting protein 1 ( Aip1p ) , 1 identified in our two - hybrid analysis using actin as bait , had a very distinct interaction footprint on actin subdo - mains III and IV . We report here that in addition to inter - acting with actin , Aip1p also associates with the small ac - tin - binding protein cofilin . Members of the cofilin / actin depolymerizing factor fam - ily are conserved actin monomer and filament binding proteins that induce actin filament disassembly ( for review see Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . Yeast cofilin is 40 % identi - cal in sequence to mammalian cofilin / actin depolymerizing factor ; the gene is essential in yeast and the gene product localizes to cortical actin patches ( Moon et al . 1993 ) . Re - cently , two advances have led to a greater understanding of cofilin function in yeast : ( 1 ) A synoptic set of cofilin mu - Address correspondence to David C .

In this report , we have used this large set of genetic and structural tools in conjunction with classical biochemical and cell biological analyses to gain insight into the func - tion of the interactions between Aip1p , cofilin , and actin . We found that Aip1p mediates the restriction of cofilin to cortical actin patches and that purified Aip1p has dramatic effects on cofilin’s activity in vitro . Our results suggest that these two proteins interact in vivo to regulate actin dy - namics . Materials and Methods Yeast Strains , Media , and Genetic Methods Yeast strains are listed in Table I . FY23 and FY86 were provided by Fred Winston ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . Y187 and Y190 were provided by Steve Elledge ( Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX ) . DDY319 , DDY321 , DDY760 , and DDY496 were constructed as de - scribed ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 , 1994 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) . Standard methods were employed for growth , sporulation , and tetrad dissection of yeast ( Rose et al . , 1989 ) . Yeast transformations were performed by electropora - tion ( Becker and Guarente , 1991 ) or by lithium acetate ( Rose et al . , 1989 ) . The medium for two - hybrid analysis was synthetic medium plus dextrose supplemented with adenine to 10 (cid:109) g / ml and 3 , 5 - amino - triazole ( 3 - AT ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) at 25 , 50 , or 100 mM . Plasmid Construction and DNA Manipulations Plasmid pRB2247 was constructed by isolating a 1 . 4 - kb product of a BglII partial digest of plasmid pRB2248 and cloning this fragment into the BamHI site of plasmid pGEX - 5X - 3 ( Pharmacia Biotech , Inc . ) such that the AIP1 gene was in frame with the glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) reading frame . Plasmid pRB2251 was constructed by subcloning a 2 . 2 - kb ClaI fragment from AIP1 genomic clone pRB2249 into YCp50 such that AIP1 and bla transcription is divergent . The deletion allele of AIP1 was constructed by double fusion PCR and has been described elsewhere ( Amberg et al . , 1995b ) . Plasmids encoding fusions of the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( DBD ) to SNF1 ( pSE1112 ) , the GAL4 DBD to lamin ( pAS1 - lamin ) , and the GAL4 activation domain ( AD ) to SNF4 ( pSE1111 ) were provided by Steve Elledge .

Aip1p Activates Cofilin to Disassemble Actin Filaments 1253 ously were described elsewhere ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ) . The plasmid en - coding a fusion of the GAL4 DBD to AIP1 ( pDAb189 ) was constructed by removing the AIP1 open reading frame from pRB2248 as a BglII par - tial digest and cloning it into the BamHI site of plasmid pRB1516 ( Am - berg et al . , 1995a ) ( a Cen version of pAS1 - CYH2 ) so that the AIP1 open reading frame is in frame with that of the GAL4 DBD . The construct en - coding a fusion of the GAL4 AD to ABP1 ( pDAb20 ) was constructed by excising the ABP1 open reading frame from plasmid pRB1199 ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) as a 1 . 9 - kb XhoI - EcoRI fragment , blunting the EcoRI site with T4 DNA polymerase and cloning into plasmid pACTII ( gift of Steve Elledge ) that had been cut with XhoI and SalI in which the SalI site had been made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase . The resulting construct expresses all but the first 11 amino acids of Abp1p fused to Gal4p . The constructs encoding fusions of the cofilin mutants to the Gal4p AD ( used for the footprinting studies ) were constructed by PCR into plasmid pACTII . The cofilin mutant and wild - type alleles were amplified off plas - mids ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) using primers DAo - COF1 - 1 ( 5 (cid:57) - cgcgccatg - gaacaaaagatgtctagatct - 3 (cid:57) ) and DAo - COF1 - 2 ( 5 (cid:57) - cggaattcaccttaatgagaac - cagcgcc - 3 (cid:57) ) and vent polymerase ( New England Biolabs Inc . ) . Subcloning of cof1 - 4 required the use of the special primer DAo - COF1 - 3 ( 5 (cid:57) - cgcgc - catggaacaaaagatgtctagagct - 3 (cid:57) ) in the place of primer DAo - COF1 - 1 . The PCR products were cut with NcoI and EcoRI and cloned into similarly cut pACTII . Each construct was cloned and tested in duplicates generated from separate PCR reactions . When possible , constructs were confirmed by a BbvI digest . Plasmid pACTII - COF1 was made by PCR amplification of the COF1 open reading frame with oligonucleotides PL70 ( 5 (cid:57) - gcgcg - ccatggggtctagatctggtgttgctgttgc - 3 (cid:57) ) and PL76 . 2 ( 5 (cid:57) - gcgcgcggatccttaatgag - aaccagcgcctctgc - 3 (cid:57) ) , digestion of the PCR product with NcoI - BamHI , and subcloning of this insert in frame into similarly digested pACTII . To express Aip1p as a GST fusion protein in yeast , primers ARP1 ( 5 (cid:57) - gcgcgggatccatgtcatctatctctttgaaggaa - 3 (cid:57) ) and ARP3 ( 5 (cid:57) - cgcgccggccgctcactc - gaggacaacattccacct - 3 (cid:57) ) were used to amplify the AIP1 open reading frame from genomic DNA . This PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and EagI and cloned into similarly cut pEG ( KT ) ( Mitchell et al . , 1993 ) to make plasmid pAR3 . To express Aip1p for in vitro translation , primers ARP16 ( 5 (cid:57) - gcgcgca - catgtatgtcatctatctctttgaaggaa - 3 (cid:57) ) and ARP4 ( 5 (cid:57) - gcgcgaagctttcactcgagga - caacattccacct - 3 (cid:57) ) were used to amplify the AIP1 open reading frame from genomic DNA . This PCR product was cleaved with AflIII and HindIII and cloned into pBAT4 ( Përanen et al . , 1996 ) cut with NcoI and HindIII to make plasmid pAR20 . Protein Purification and Antibody Production Aip1 - GST fusion protein for antibody production was purified from bacterial strain UT5600 ( (cid:68) [ ompT - fepA ] leu proC trpE ) ( provided by S . Gottesman , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) carrying plasmid pRB2247 by standard methods ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ; GST Gene Fu - sion System manual , Pharmacia Biotech , Inc . ) . Antibodies were raised in three New Zealand white rabbits by injection of 100 (cid:109) g GST - Aip1 in 1 ml of adjuvant ( RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc . ) , three times at 2 - wk in - tervals . 2 wk after the last boost , the animals were exsanguinated . Anti - Aip1 antibodies were affinity - purified on columns to which GST - Aip1p had been conjugated by standard methods ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Puri - fied antibodies were concentrated on a Centriplus concentrator ( Amicon Inc . ) . Yeast actin was purified as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . However , the formamide eluate from the DNaseI column was dialyzed overnight against three changes of G buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) , and concentrated to 2 ml in Cen - triprep 10 devices ( Amicon , Inc . ) . The actin was polymerized by adding initiation salts to a final concentration of 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and incubating for 2 h at room temperature . Residual actin - binding proteins were stripped from F - actin at this point by slowly adding KCl to 0 . 6 M and further incubating for 30 min . The polymerized actin was pelleted at 80 , 000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature in a TLA100 . 3 rotor ( Beck - man Instruments , Inc . ) . The pelleted actin was resuspended in G buffer to a final concentration of 50 (cid:109) M and dialyzed against three changes of 2 li - ters of G buffer before it was frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Co - filin was purified as a GST - fusion protein from Escherichia coli and subse - quently cleaved from GST by thrombin digestion as described previously ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Aip1p was purified from the yeast strain DDY130 ( carrying the plas - mid pAR3 ) as a GST fusion protein under the control of the GAL pro - moter . 4 liters of cells were grown at 30 (cid:56) C in synthetic medium with 2 % dextrose and without uracil or leucine to an OD of 1 . 0 at 600 nm , har - vested by centrifugation , and resuspended in 4 liters of synthetic medium with 2 % glycerol and without uracil or leucine . After an overnight incuba - tion at 30 (cid:56) C to derepress the galactose promoter , cells were again har - vested and resuspended in 4 liters of rich medium with 2 % galactose . The cultures were induced for 8 h at 30 (cid:56) C before cells were once again har - vested , washed twice with 100 ml water , resuspended in 10 ml water , fro - zen as 50 - (cid:109) l pellets in liquid N 2 , and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Yeast pellets were lysed in liquid N 2 in a Waring blender and thawed in PBS to a final con - centration of 1 (cid:51) , with 1 mM PMSF and 0 . 5 (cid:109) g / ml each of antipain , leu - peptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , and aprotin . The lystate was cleared first by spinning at 17 , 000 g in a Dupont GSA rotor . The supernatant from this spin was cleared by spinning at 50 , 000 rpm for 50 min in a Beckman 70Ti rotor . This high speed supernatant was dialyzed overnight against PBS and passed twice over a column with a 4 - ml bed of glutathione agarose beads ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . The column was washed five times with PBS and incubated with thrombin ( 5 U / ml ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) overnight at room temperature to cleave the Aip1p from the GST . The column was washed with 8 ml 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCl , and the flow - through was concentrated to 2 ml and loaded onto a 1 - ml mono - Q anion exchange column ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc . ) . A linear salt gradient from 100 to 400 mM KCl was applied to the column and peak fractions contain - ing Aip1p were concentrated to 15 (cid:109) M , frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Two - Hybrid Analyses In all cases , two - hybrid analyses were performed by mating strain Y190 carrying constructs encoding fusions to the Gal4 DBD , to strain Y187 car - rying constructs encoding fusions to the Gal4 AD . Transformants were lined , spotted , or spread as lawns on selective medium , synthetic complete medium lacking Trp ( SC - TRP ) or DBD fusions and synthetic complete medium lacking Leu ( SC - LEU ) for AD fusions . Mating was carried out by replica plating the Y190 and Y187 derivatives together onto yeast ex - tract / peptone / dextrose medium – plates , incubating at 30 (cid:56) C for 24 h , select - ing the mated cells on SC - TRP , - LEU . The selected diploids , carrying both DBD and AD fusion constructs , were replica plated to media containing 25 , 50 , and 100 mM 3 - AT ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) and incubated at 25 (cid:56) C . Microscopy Immunofluorescence was performed by standard protocols using a metha - nol / acetone fixation ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) . Affinity - purified anti - Aip1p an - tibody was used at a dilution of 1 : 100 . Affinity - purified rabbit anticofilin was used at 1 : 100 . Guinea pig antiactin antisera ( animal 2 ) ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) was used at 1 : 2 , 000 . For Aip1p localization , FITC - conjugated goat anti – rabbit IgG ( Organon Teknika Corp . ) was used at 1 : 1 , 000 and rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – guinea pig ( Organon Teknika Corp . ) was used at 1 : 1 , 000 . For Aip1p localization in wild - type and act1 - 111 strains , rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – rabbit IgG ( Cappel ; ICN Bio - medicals ) was used at 1 : 1 , 000 . For cofilin localization in DAY30 and DDY1264 FITC - conjugated goat anti – rabbit IgG ( Cappel ; ICN Biochem - icals ) was used at 1 : 1 , 000 and rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – guinea pig IgG ( Cappel ; ICN Biochemicals ) was used at 1 : 1 , 000 . Actin Filament Sedimentation Assay To evaluate actin filament sedimentation in the presence of Aip1p and cofilin , 3 . 75 (cid:109) M actin was polymerized at room temperature in F - buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 7 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) . After 45 min , polymerized actin ( final concentration , 2 . 5 (cid:109) M ) was added to variable concentrations of Aip1p ( final concentra - tion , 0 . 012 – 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) and / or cofilin ( final concentration , 0 . 125 – 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) in F - buffer . The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and centrifuged at 90 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 23 (cid:56) C in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) to pellet the actin filaments . Equal proportions of the pellets and supernatants were fractionated on 12 % SDS - PAGE gels and proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining . Protein levels were quantified using NIH Image software . F - Actin Binding Assay To test the cofilin dependence of Aip1p binding to F - actin , variable con - centrations of yeast F - actin were incubated for 20 min at 25 (cid:56) C with equimolar amounts of cofilin or control buffer . [ 35 S ] Methionine - labeled in vitro – translated ( TNT quick coupled transcription / translation ; Promega The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 1254 Corp . ) Aip1p from plasmid pAR20 was incubated for 20 min with the co - filin – F - actin and pelleted for 20 min at 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) . Equal amounts of supernatants and pellets were fractionated on 13 % SDS - PAGE gels and visualized by autoradiography . Results were quantified on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software ( STORM 860 ; Molecular Dynamics , Inc . ) and on an IS2000 densitometer using AlphaImager software . Molecular Modeling Images of actin and cofilin molecular models were generated on a Silicon Graphics Indigo™ workstation running Sybil software ( Tripos Inc . ) . Co - ordinates for actin ( file 1ATN ) and yeast cofilin ( file 1CFY ) were re - trieved from the Brookhaven database . Results Identification and Sequence of Aip1p Aip1p was first identified as a 67 - kD yeast protein that in - teracts with actin in the two - hybrid system ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ; GenBank accession number P46680 ) and is the first discovered member of a family of conserved proteins ( Fig . Figure 1 . Sequence alignment of Aip1p and its homologues . Identities are boxed . Sequences were aligned with ClustalW 1 . 7 and ana - lyzed in Seqvu 1 . 1 ( Garvan Research Institute ) . Identity is assigned if 4 of 6 residues at a position are identical . SwissProt accession numbers for the given sequences are the following : S . cerevisiae ( P46680 ) , S . pombe ( O14301 ) , P . polycephalum ( P90587 ) , D . discoi - deum ( P54686 ) , C . elegans ( Q11176 ) , and Homo sapiens ( GenBank AF020056 ) . Rodal et al . Aip1p Activates Cofilin to Disassemble Actin Filaments 1255 1 ) . Homologues of Aip1p have been identified in Schiz - osaccharomyces pombe , Physarum polycephalum ( Matsu - moto et al . , 1998 ) , Dictyostelium discoideum , Caenorhab - ditis elegans ( where there are two homologues ) , Mus musculus , and humans . Additionally , members of the Aip1p family show weak homology to proteins that con - tain reiterated motifs called WD repeats . These repeats were first identified in (cid:98) subunits of trimeric G - proteins ( Fong et al . , 1986 ) and have since been found in proteins with highly diverse functions . Members of the Aip1p fam - ily contain from four to eight WD repeats . Two - Hybrid Interactions between Aip1p and Cofilin To identify additional Aip1p ligands we used a two - hybrid construct of Aip1p fused to the GAL4 DBD ( plasmid pDAb189 ) to screen a large set of yeast actin interacting proteins and cell polarity proteins fused to the GAL4 acti - vation domain . Included in this set were clones encoding AIP1 , AIP2 , AIP3 , OYE2 , SRV2 , PFY1 , COF1 , BNR1 , LAS17 , MNN10 , ABP1 , RVS167 , BEM1 , FUS1 , and SAC6 . As can be seen in Fig . 2 , we found that in addition to actin , Aip1p also interacted with Cof1p ( yeast cofilin ) . These interactions are specific since no activation was ob - served between Aip1p and the transcription factor Snf4p or between Aip1p and the actin cortical patch protein Abp1p ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , the Aip1p – actin and Aip1p – cofilin two - hybrid interactions are reciprocal . An apparent cofilin – cofilin interaction also was detected but is likely the result of bridging through actin . The focus of this study is the functional significance of the Aip1p – cofilin interaction . The Aip1p and Cofilin Binding Footprints on Actin To obtain a structural framework for understanding the functions of the Aip1p – actin and cofilin – actin interactions , we used actin mutations ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ) in conjunc - tion with the two - hybrid system to identify likely sites of interaction for these proteins on actin . This approach was described previously for the identification of the binding footprint of Aip1p on actin ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ) and was repeated here to identify the binding footprint for cofilin on actin ( Fig . 3 , A and B and Table II ) . Yeast strain Y187 , carrying a fusion of the Gal4p AD to cofilin , was mated to strain Y190 containing plasmids en - coding fusions of 35 actin mutants to the Gal4p DBD ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ) . Diploids were replica plated on 3 - AT medium to assess activation of the His3p two - hybrid reporter ( Fig . 3 A ) . Failure to grow on this medium indi - cates that the actin mutant contained in that strain is de - fective for the cofilin – actin interaction . This result sug - gests that the mutation may lie in or near the cofilin binding site on actin . We discovered that eight actin mu - tants failed to interact with cofilin ( Fig . 3 A ) . Of these eight , five have thus far failed to interact with any actin - binding protein tested ( act1 - 107 , act1 - 130 , act1 - 127 , act1 - 128 , and act1 - 108 ) and probably encode either unfolded or unstable proteins . Therefore , nothing can be concluded from these mutants . However , the remaining three mu - tants ( act1 - 103 , act1 - 106 , and act1 - 126 ) display specific ef - fects on the cofilin – actin interaction ( Fig . 3 A ) . The three mutations that specifically disrupt the cofilin – actin interaction are located in a small region of subdo - main III on actin . Interestingly , these three mutations form one - half of the Aip1p binding footprint ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ) that includes act1 - 109 , act1 - 111 , and act1 - 112 , as well as act1 - 103 , act1 - 106 , and act1 - 126 ( Fig . 3 B ) . These data are consistent with the model that Aip1p binding to actin is facilitated by cofilin . The Aip1p and Actin Binding Footprints on Cofilin A large set of mutant alleles of cofilin has been con - structed ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) and the yeast cofilin structure has been determined ( Federov et al . , 1997 ) . This presented us with the opportunity to use our two - hybrid methodology to identify surfaces on cofilin required for its interactions with Aip1p and actin . Toward this end , we cloned the cofilin mutants into the two - hybrid activation domain vector pACTII ( gift of S . Elledge ) and scored the ability of these mutants to interact with Aip1p and actin . Four cofilin mutants failed to interact with both actin and Aip1p : cof1 - 9 , cof1 - 16 , cof1 - 17 , and cof1 - 20 . Two cofilin mutants specifically failed to interact with actin : cof1 - 6 and cof1 - 14 . Three mutants , cof1 - 4 , cof1 - 13 , and cof1 - 22 , failed to interact with Aip1p but interacted well with actin . We displayed the two - hybrid data on the molecular model of cofilin ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . In agreement with the in vitro binding data of cofilin mutants to actin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , the two - hybrid data identified a ridge that is involved in the actin interaction ( Fig . 3 , red and purple in B and C ) , on the edge of the disc - shaped cofilin protein . A subset of the mutations that disrupted the cofilin – actin in - teraction constitute part of the Aip1p footprint on cofilin ( shown in purple in Fig . 3 , C and D ) . A different set of mu - tations specifically affected cofilin interactions with Aip1p and not actin ( shown in blue ) . These data are consistent Figure 2 . Two - hybrid interactions of Aip1p . A GAL4 - based two - hybrid system was used to assess interactions between Aip1p and several proteins involved in cytoskeleton function and cell polar - ity . Displayed here is a representative sampling of that data . The two - hybrid plasmids were cointroduced by mating strain Y190 , carrying plasmids encoding fusions to the GAL4 DBD , and strain Y187 , carrying plasmids encoding fusions to the GAL4 AD . The resulting diploids were selected and replica plated to medium containing 100 mM 3 - AT . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 1256 Figure 3 . Two - hybrid analysis of the structure of the Aip1p – cofilin – actin complex . Two - hybrid analysis was performed between 36 ac - tin alleles fused to the GAL4 DBD and cofilin fused to the GAL4 AD . Activation of the HIS3 two - hybrid reporter was assessed on me - dium containing 50 mM 3 - AT at 25 (cid:56) C ( A ) . A model of the actin monomer is shown in B . In red are the amino acids altered by mutations that disrupt both the actin – cofilin and actin – Aip1p two - hybrid interactions .

The allele num - bers of disruptive mutations are indicated . Displayed in C and D are two views , 180 (cid:56) apart , of yeast cofilin . Mutations that disrupted both the cofilin – actin and the cofilin – Aip1p two - hybrid interactions are indicated in purple . Mutations that disrupted the cofilin – actin interaction alone are indicated in red . Mutations that disrupted the cofilin – Aip1p interaction alone are indicated in blue , and mutations that had no effect on either the cofilin – actin or cofilin – Aip1 interactions are shown in green . Rodal et al . Aip1p Activates Cofilin to Disassemble Actin Filaments 1257 with the model that Aip1p binding to cofilin is facilitated by actin because , according to this model , disruption of the cofilin – actin interaction would be predicted to also disrupt the Aip1p – cofilin interaction . Overall , the footprinting data suggest that there is a ternary complex between Aip1p , cofilin , and actin , and that the members of this complex make distinct contacts with each other . Synthetic Interactions with aip1 (cid:68) Mutants The actin cytoskeleton consists of a large number of inter - acting components . Often the deletion of a gene encoding one of these components does not in itself cause a readily detectable phenotype . However , combinations of muta - tions can produce informative synthetic phenotypes that suggest a shared or parallel function for the proteins in - volved ( Adams et al . , 1993 ) . Deletion of the AIP1 gene had no effect on cell growth on a variety of media at a vari - ety of temperatures ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we in - vestigated its genetic interactions with mutations in genes that encode other actin - binding proteins . First we crossed the aip1 (cid:68) strain to the collection of clustered - charged - to - alanine mutants of COF1 ( cof1 - 4 , cof1 - 5 , cof1 - 6 , cof1 - 7 , cof1 - 10 , cof1 - 11 , cof1 - 12 , cof1 - 13 , cof1 - 15 , cof1 - 18 , cof1 - 19 , cof1 - 21 , and cof1 - 22 ) . The results of these crosses are shown in Table II . The aip1 (cid:68) mutation is synthetically lethal with cof1 - 5 and cof1 - 22 , which are both temperature sensitive for growth on their own and show defects in actin turnover rates in vivo at the permis - sive temperature ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . In ad - dition , the aip1 (cid:68) mutant is synthetically lethal with cof1 - 4 , which has no growth phenotype of its own but has actin or - ganization defects as visualized by rhodamine - phalloidin staining ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . The aip1 (cid:68) mutant is also synthetically temperature sensitive at 37 (cid:56) C with cof1 - 6 , which has no actin organization or growth phenotype on its own ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . We examined actin and cofilin localization in the aip1 (cid:68) cof1 - 6 double mutant . At the permissive temperature , the double mutant grows slowly and has actin clumps in the mother cell . These clumps stain with rhodamine - phalloidin , which binds spe - cifically to F - actin and not G - actin . At the restrictive tem - perature , actin is depolarized , actin clumps are apparent , and unbudded cells accumulate . Cofilin colocalizes with the actin structures at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures ( data not shown ) . We also determined if the aip1 (cid:68) mutation displayed synthetic lethality with any of the viable actin – alanine scan alleles of actin ( act1 - 1 , - 101 , 102 , 104 , 105 , 108 , 111 , 113 , 115 , 116 , 117 , 119 , 120 , 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 , 129 , 132 , 133 , 136 ) and act1 - 159 , which decreases rates of actin fila - ment turnover in vivo and in vitro ( Belmont et al . , 1998 ) . When a yeast strain carrying the act1 - 159 mutation was crossed to the aip1 (cid:68) strain , double mutant spores failed to grow at 25 (cid:56) C . We also observed subtle synthetic growth defects in double mutants containing the aip1 (cid:68) allele and three other actin alleles : act1 - 133 , act1 - 119 , and act1 - 125 ( data not shown ) . These three mutations are not located near the Aip1p interaction interface on actin ( Fig . 3 ) , sug - gesting that the weak synthetic interactions are not a func - tion of compromised Aip1p – actin interactions but of cu - mulative defects in cytoskeletal function .

Genetic interactions were determined from dissection of eight tetrads derived from two different complex heterozygotes . The tetrads were incubated at 25°C and the genotypes of the spore strains were inferred from marker segregation . None of the double mutants were viable for combinations scored as showing synthetic lethality . Double mutants that were viable at 25°C were grown at a variety of temperatures and compared in parallel with sibling spores from the same tetrads ( including single mutants ) to determine temperature sensitivity . 27 of 29 aip1 (cid:68) cof1 - 6 isolates were temperature sen - sitive at 37°C . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 1258 Finally , we determined if the aip1 (cid:68) allele was syntheti - cally lethal with deletion alleles of six other components of the yeast cortical cytoskeleton : ABP1 , SLA1 , SLA2 , TWF1 , CAP2 , and SAC6 . No clear synthetic lethality was found . However , the sac6 (cid:68) , cap2 (cid:68) - 1 , and sla1 (cid:68) mutations had slight synthetic growth defects in combination with the aip1 (cid:68) allele ( data not shown ) . Aip1p Localizes to Cortical Actin Patches As a further test of the importance of the Aip1p – actin and Aip1p – cofilin interactions in vivo , we sought to de - termine if Aip1p colocalizes with actin and cofilin . To - ward this end , we generated antibodies to a GST - Aip1p fusion protein . These antibodies specifically recognize a 67 - kD protein on Western blots of wild - type ( FY23 ) yeast extract ( Fig . 4 A , inset , lane 1 ) that is of the ex - pected size based on the primary sequence of AIP1 . This band is absent from AIP1 deletion strain DAY53 ( Fig . 4 A , inset , lane 2 ) , but is restored when a low copy num - ber vector carrying a 2 . 2 - kb AIP1 genomic fragment ( pRB2251 ) is introduced into the deletion strain ( Fig . 4 A , inset , lane 3 ) . Wild - type strain FY23 (cid:51) 86 was stained with the anti - Aip1p antibodies ( Fig . 4 B ) and guinea pig antiactin anti - bodies ( Fig . 4 A ) . Aip1p localized only to cortical actin patches and was not detected along the actin cables . This localization pattern is identical to that observed for cofilin ( Moon , 1993 ) , but simultaneous colocalization of Aip1p and cofilin was not possible , since both antibodies were raised in rabbits . Since both Aip1p and cofilin appear to be found in all actin cortical patches recognizable by anti - actin antibodies , we presume that Aip1p and cofilin colo - calize . Aip1p also localized diffusely throughout the cyto - plasm and this cytoplasmic staining is not seen in the aip1 (cid:68) strain ( data not shown ) . Figure 4 . Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches .

Aip1p Activates Cofilin to Disassemble Actin Filaments 1259 The Aip1p – Actin Interaction Is Required for Aip1p Localization to Cortical Patches To assess the importance and relevance of the Aip1p – actin two - hybrid interaction , we localized Aip1p in a strain bearing actin mutations that disrupt the Aip1p – actin two - hybrid interaction . Fig . 5 A shows Aip1p localization in the act1 - 111 strain TDS143 . Aip1p was not detected in cor - tical patches in the mutant strain and there is an apparent increase in the cytosolic Aip1p signal . The failure of Aip1p to localize in this strain is not due to a loss in the ability of cofilin to bind to actin ( Fig . 5 B ) . Similarly , Aip1p localiza - tion to cortical patches in an act1 - 112 strain is severely compromised ( Fig . 5 C ) , whereas cofilin localization to patches in this strain is not affected ( Fig . 5 D ) . Aip1p was well localized to cortical patches in act1 - 119 , act1 - 132 , act1 - 124 , and act1 - 125 strains ( data not shown ) indicating that Aip1p mislocalization is not caused by generalized de - fects in the actin cytoskeleton . These results suggest that Aip1p must bind to F - actin for stable association with cor - tical actin patches and is consistent with the two - hybrid data suggesting that Aip1p contacts actin in the vicinity of the act1 - 111 and act1 - 112 mutations . Aip1p Localization in Cofilin Mutants To test the importance of the Aip1p – cofilin interaction on Aip1p localization , we examined Aip1p localization in via - ble cofilin mutants ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Both Aip1p and cofilin were localized by indirect immunofluorescence in strains bearing 14 different cof1 alleles : cof1 - 4 , cof1 - 5 , cof1 - 6 , cof1 - 7 , cof1 - 8 , cof1 - 10 , cof1 - 11 , cof1 - 12 , cof1 - 13 , cof1 - 15 , cof1 - 18 , cof1 - 19 , cof1 - 21 , cof1 - 22 , and a wild - type congenic strain ( Table II ) . The cells were grown at 25 (cid:56) C , a permissive temperature for all the strains , before fixation . Aip1p localized to patches in all of the cofilin mutants ex - cept the strain carrying the cof1 - 19 allele . Fig . 5 E shows Aip1p localization in cof1 - 19 strain DDY1264 . As was seen with the act1 - 111 strain , Aip1p is lost completely from the cortical patches in cof1 - 19 cells and there is an apparent increase in the cytoplasmic pool of Aip1p . Dou - ble labeling of this strain with antiactin and anticofilin an - tibodies showed that Cof1 - 19p is associated with cortical actin patches ( Fig . 6 ) . The cof1 - 19 strain , like the aip1 (cid:68) strain , is viable and has a wild - type growth phenotype . We have examined the actin cytoskeleton in these strains and found no obvious defects . However , both strains do appear to have slightly aberrant cortical actin patches : they appear by rhodamine - phalloidin staining to be slightly larger or perhaps to contain more F - actin ( data not shown ) . In addition , the cof1 - 19 cells have slightly depolarized actin patches and misoriented actin cables . Aip1p is Required for Normal Cofilin Localization To examine the role of Aip1p in cofilin localization , we immunolocalized cofilin in the aip1 (cid:68) strain . Surprisingly , cofilin localized not only to cortical patches but also to ac - tin cables ( Fig . 6 D ) . We confirmed colocalization of cofi - lin with actin cables by double staining with the guinea pig antiactin antibody , as shown in Fig . 6 C . This result sug - gests that Aip1p is required to restrict cofilin to cortical ac - tin patches in the yeast actin cytoskeleton . We asked if exclusive localization of cofilin to cortical actin patches depends on localization of Aip1p to these patches . To address this question , we examined cofilin lo - calization in the cof1 - 19 mutant strain DDY1264 , in which Aip1p is localized in the cytoplasm . As can be seen in Fig . 6 F , Cof1 - 19p is localized to both the patches and the ca - bles . Fig . 6 E shows the same cells stained with the antiac - tin antibody confirming association of Cof1 - 19p with the actin cables . Though act1 - 111 and act1 - 112 mutants also fail to localize Aip1p to actin patches ( Fig . 5 ) , we were un - able to confirm that cofilin also localizes to actin cables in these strains because their actin cytoskeletons are more generally disrupted and cables are undetectable by anti - body staining ( data not shown ) . We next asked if the localization of other proteins nor - mally localized to the cortical actin patches was affected in the aip1 (cid:68) strain . We found that immunolocalization of Abp1p , fimbrin / Sac6p , and coronin / Crn1p was unaffected by the absence of Aip1p ( data not shown ) . This indicates that the role of Aip1p in cofilin localization is specific and not reflective of gross structural defects in the cortical patches . Aip1p Increases the Extent of Cofilin - induced Depolymerization To evaluate directly the functional and physical interac - tion between cofilin , actin , and Aip1p , we investigated the effects that these proteins might have together in vitro . Aip1p was expressed in yeast as a GST fusion protein un - der the control of the GAL promoter . GST – Aip1p was af - finity - purified from extracts on glutathione - agarose beads , cleaved from GST by thrombin digestion , and purified by cation exchange chromatography . This protein has two additional amino acids NH 2 - terminal to the primary se - quence of Aip1p . No contaminants are apparent in the preparation on overloaded ( 5 (cid:109) g ) Coomassie stained gels ( data not shown ) . To evaluate the interaction of Aip1p with F - actin at steady state , we carried out cosedimentation assays with 2 . 5 (cid:109) M prepolymerized yeast F - actin . For all of the assays described here , after 20 min of coincubation the reaction is at steady state as evaluated by light - scattering at 400 nm ( data not shown ) . Although a small proportion ( 5 – 10 % ) of purified Aip1p sedimented in the absence of actin in these assays , this amount did not perceptibly increase upon ad - dition of actin ( data not shown ) . Given the two - hybrid in - teraction of Aip1p and cofilin , it seemed possible that an actin – Aip1p interaction might be mediated by cofilin . To test this hypothesis , we performed the cosedimentation as - say in the presence of recombinant cofilin , which binds to F - actin and accelerates disassembly rates ( increasing sub - unit turnover ) , but does not significantly change actin polymer levels at steady state ( Fig . 7 B , lanes 1 and 2 ) . Strikingly , in the presence of both Aip1p and cofilin , we observed a dramatic shift of actin and cofilin from the pel - let to the supernatant ( Fig . 7 A , lane 2 ) . This shift might be explained by invoking a monomer sequestering model as applies for twinfilin ( Goode et al . , 1998 ) , a protein that binds stoichiometrically to actin monomer , preventing nu - cleotide exchange and polymerization . We examined the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 1260 Figure 5 . Aip1p localization to cortical patches requires actin and cofilin . Immunofluorescence was performed on strain TDS143 ( act1 - 111 ) grown at 25 (cid:56) C ( A and B ) , strain DDY355 grown at 37 (cid:56) C ( act1 - 112 ; C and D ) , and strain DDY1264 ( cof1 - 19 ) grown at 25 (cid:56) C ( E ) using affinity - purified anti - Aip1p antibody ( A , C , and E ) , affinity - purified rabbit anticofilin antibody ( B and D ) , and a fluorescein - conjugated goat anti – rabbit secondary anti - body . Rodal et al . Aip1p Activates Cofilin to Disassemble Actin Filaments 1261 effects of stoichiometry on the Aip1p - dependent shift by varying the concentration of Aip1p ( 0 . 012 – 2 . 5 (cid:109) M ; Fig . 7 A , lanes 2 – 6 ) or cofilin ( 0 . 12 – 2 . 5 (cid:109) M ; Fig . 7 B , lanes 3 – 7 ) in cosedimentation assays with constant concentrations of F - actin ( 2 . 5 (cid:109) M ) . Intriguingly , though the shift into the su - pernatant showed a linear dependence on cofilin , it did not require Aip1p at similar stoichiometry . In fact , a signifi - cant shift occurred at molar ratios of Aip1p / cofilin / actin as low as 1 : 50 : 50 ( Fig . 7 A , lane 4 ) , and can even be seen at molar ratios of Aip1p / cofilin / actin as low as 1 : 200 : 200 ( Fig . 7 A , lane 6 ) . F - Actin Binding of Aip1p Is Facilitated by Cofilin We used radiolabeled in vitro – translated Aip1p to evalu - ate binding to F - actin at a low concentration of Aip1p , which would not promote net disassembly of the filaments . The in vitro – translated Aip1p product sedimented with actin filaments . This cosedimentation was abolished by ad - dition of excess nonradiolabeled Aip1p or by dilution of the sample , suggesting that the binding is specific ( data not shown ) . To establish the dependence of this binding on co - filin , we pelleted increasing concentrations of actin fila - ments with or without stoichiometric cofilin with in vitro – translated Aip1p . Aip1p cosedimented with the F - actin in the absence of added cofilin , but addition of 1 : 1 cofilin in - creased the amount that cosedimented ( Fig . 8 A ) . The binding of Aip1p to cofilin – F - actin is saturatable with a K d of (cid:122) 4 (cid:109) M . Similar results were obtained by Western blot analysis of identical experiments with purified Aip1p ( data Figure 6 . Selective localization of cofilin to cortical patches is dependent on Aip1p . Immunofluorescence was performed on wild - type strain DDY1252 ( A and B ) , aip1 (cid:68) strain DAY30 ( C and D ) , and on cof1 - 19 strain DDY1264 ( E and F ) using guinea pig antiactin anti - bodies and a rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – guinea pig secondary antibody ( A , C , and E ) , and anticofilin antibodies in conjunction with an FITC - conjugated goat anti – rabbit secondary antibody ( B , D , and F ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 1262 not shown ) . We next examined how much added cofilin was required to get the increased binding . The amount of Aip1p cosedimenting with 7 . 5 (cid:109) M F - actin falls off linearly with cofilin concentration ( Fig . 8 B ) . Aip1p cosedimenta - tion with F - actin could be increased in the presence of co - filin either because cofilin creates more binding sites for Aip1p , or because cofilin increases the affinity of Aip1p for actin . To distinguish between these possibilities , we added 15 and 45 nM purified Aip1p to 5 (cid:109) M cofilin - satu - rated actin filaments ( which is below the concentration that saturates Aip1p binding ) and ran the sedimentation reaction . A threefold higher concentration of Aip1p in - creases the fraction of Aip1p cosedimenting with actin , suggesting that Aip1p binding sites are not saturated , and that the cofilin - dependent increase in binding reflects an increased affinity of Aip1p for F - actin in the presence of cofilin ( data not shown ) . To determine stoichiometries of these proteins in yeast cells , we estimated the ratio of Aip1p / cofilin / actin in the cell by comparing immuno - blots of whole - cell extracts and purified proteins of known concentration ( data not shown ) . Aip1p , cofilin , and actin are each present in whole - cell extracts at a ratio of about 1 : 1 : 5 or 1 : 1 : 10 . Discussion Aip1p – Cofilin – Actin Interactions Suggest a Ternary Complex Aip1p was originally identified by its two - hybrid interac - tion with actin ( Amberg et al . , 1995a ) . Further two - hybrid analysis revealed an interaction between Aip1p and cofilin ( Fig . 2 ) raising the possibility that actin , Aip1p , and cofilin might form a ternary complex . The existence of such a ter - nary complex is supported by evidence that Aip1p and co - filin are dependent on each other and on actin for their correct localization in vivo ( Fig . 5 ) . Binding experiments with purified proteins also support an Aip1p – cofilin – actin complex ( Fig . 8 ) . Binding of purified or in vitro – translated Aip1p to F - actin is concentration - dependent and increases at high ratios of cofilin / actin . Since cofilin is a contaminant in yeast actin preparations , despite efforts to deplete it ( (cid:122) 1 (cid:109) M / 100 (cid:109) M actin ) , we cannot rule out the possibility that contaminating native cofilin is responsible for the baseline binding to F - actin in the absence of added recom - binant cofilin . Thus , it is possible that Aip1p binding to F - actin is strictly cofilin - dependent . We were unable to show a direct interaction between Aip1p and cofilin and / or G - actin by native gel shift or by cosedimentation with GST – Aip1p , further suggesting that Aip1p interacts with cofilin on F - actin . A large set of mutations in both actin ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ) and cofilin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) was used in conjunction with the two - hybrid system to identify regions of actin and cofilin involved in the Aip1p interaction ( Fig . 3 ) . Those data that describe the cofilin – actin interface ap - pear sound since they agree with similar studies using bio - chemical ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , modeling ( Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) , and structural ( Amy McGough , personal communication ) approaches . The binding footprint ( as ob - tained by two - hybrid analysis ) for Aip1p on the surface of actin ( Fig . 3 B , blue and red ) partially overlaps with the Figure 7 . Aip1p enhances the extent and rate of cofilin - mediated actin dynamics . 2 . 5 (cid:109)(cid:77) actin filaments were in - cubated with varying concen - trations of cofilin and / or Aip1p . Coomassie stained gels and accompanying quan - tification show the depen - dence of the Aip1p – cofilin interaction on Aip1p concen - tration ( A ) and on cofilin concentration ( B ) . Rodal et al . Aip1p Activates Cofilin to Disassemble Actin Filaments 1263 cofilin binding site ( red ) . Similarly , the footprints of Aip1p and actin on cofilin overlap as four cofilin mutants were specifically defective for both Aip1p and actin binding . Though overlapping interaction interfaces are consistent with both competitive interactions and a ternary complex , we favor the latter model because it is consistent with the localization and in vitro binding data discussed above . While most of our structural data can be incorporated into a coherent model for interaction in a ternary complex , there were several discrepancies between the biochemical and two - hybrid data . First , only by two - hybrid assay was cof1 - 9 defective for binding to actin . Additionally , al - though cof1 - 6 has a wild - type growth phenotype , by two - hybrid analysis it appears to be completely defective for actin binding . This interaction has not been tested bio - chemically . These discrepancies may be an artifact result - ing from the fusion to Gal4p in the two - hybrid system . Al - ternatively , the cofilin - actin two - hybrid interaction might be subtly different than that observed in vitro with puri - fied components . Note that cof1 - 19 is the only cofilin mu - tant that is defective for Aip1p localization , but it appears to interact well with both Aip1p and actin by two - hybrid analysis . This cofilin mutant may interact well with actin and Aip1p in the two - hybrid complex but have subtly al - tered binding properties in vivo . In Vivo Interactions Support a Role for Aip1p in Promoting Actin Dynamics Though the AIP1 deletion mutant has no obvious pheno - type on its own , allele - specific synthetic lethality was ob - served between aip1 (cid:68) and act1 - 159 , cof1 - 4 , cof1 - 5 , cof1 - 22 , and cof1 - 6 ( at 37 (cid:56) C ) . These results suggest that in the dou - ble mutants , a common function is compromised enough that cell viability is lost . Because act1 - 159 , cof1 - 5 , and cof1 - 22 have all been shown to decrease the rate of F - actin disassembly in vivo ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) , we postulate that Aip1p also promotes actin filament turnover . This conclusion is supported by our biochemical studies of Aip1p that dem - onstrate that it causes cofilin - dependent actin filament dis - assembly ( Fig . 7 ) . Note that Cof1 - 22p has defects in actin binding in vitro , but that Cof1 - 5p does not ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that the synthetic interaction is not simply a function of compromised actin binding by cofilin . The cofilin – actin interaction has not been tested biochem - ically for cof1 - 4 or for cof1 - 6 . Specific sorting of cofilin to cortical patches but not cy - toplasmic cables is lost in aip1 (cid:68) ( Fig . 6 C ) and cof1 - 19 ( Fig . 6 E ) strains . One model that could explain these re - sults in terms of the in vitro effects of Aip1p on actin fila - ments assumes that two populations of actin cables , one cofilin - bound and one tropomyosin - bound , form in yeast cells . Cofilin - bound cables would undergo net depolymer - ization in the presence of Aip1p , as occurs for purified ac - tin filaments in vitro . Tropomyosin , which is localized to actin cables ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ) , can compete for cofilin binding sites on actin ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ) . Thus , tropomyosin would stabilize a subset of ca - bles against Aip1p – cofilin depolymerization and these would go on to be the normal cables visualized in cells . In the aip1 (cid:68) strain or in a cofilin mutant that mislocalizes Aip1p ( cof1 - 19 ) , Aip1p would not be able to function syn - ergistically with cofilin to destabilize the filaments , and both cofilin - bound and tropomyosin - bound populations of filaments would be maintained . In support of this model , cofilin also localizes to rare actin cables in act1 - 159 tpm1 (cid:68) and act1 - 159 mdm20 (cid:68) double mutant strains ( Belmont et al . , 1998 ) , which would be predicted to have hyperstable F - actin structures that would not be readily disassembled by cofilin – Aip1p . The aip1 (cid:68) allele was also found to enhance the defects observed in specific actin mutants ( act1 - 119 , act1 - 125 , and act1 - 133 ) and in null alleles of genes encoding several components of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Sac6p , Sla1p , and Cap2p ) . We believe that these double mutants most likely suffer from a general , cumulative derangement of the actin cytoskeleton , a conclusion that further sup - ports that the actin cytoskeleton is affected in the aip1 (cid:68) strain . The Aip1p – Cofilin – Actin Complex Promotes Disassembly In Vitro We demonstrated that Aip1p causes cofilin - mediated ac - Figure 8 . Aip1p actin binding is enhanced by cofilin . Actin fila - ments were assembled and incubated with cofilin and in vitro – translated Aip1p . A shows binding curves with and without added cofilin . B shows cosedimentation of Aip1p with 7 . 5 (cid:109) M ac - tin at various concentrations of cofilin . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 1264 tin filament depolymerization in vitro ( Fig . 7 ) . Interest - ingly , we discovered that Aip1p can induce cofilin - medi - ated actin filament depolymerization at stoichiometries as low as 1 : 50 : 50 Aip1 / actin / cofilin . On the other hand , cofi - lin must be present at a 1 : 1 ratio with actin for optimal Aip1p - mediated activation of depolymerization . Though we were able to detect concentration - depen - dent F - actin cosedimentation of Aip1p at a low molar ratio with actin ( by Western blot analysis or using in vi - tro – translated Aip1p ) , we were unable to detect cosedi - mentation at higher Aip1p / actin ratios . One hypothesis that explains these results is that Aip1p saturates binding at a low stoichiometry with F - actin . A second hypothesis is that high ratios of cofilin / actin are required for Aip1p binding , but that at high concentrations of Aip1p , net de - polymerization prevents cosedimentation of Aip1p with actin . A model that is consistent with substoichiometric or cofilin - dependent filament binding , net filament depoly - merization , and the two - hybrid footprinting data is that Aip1p enhances the weak severing activity of cofilin ( Mac - Iver et al . 1991 ; McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Aip1p is the first protein aside from actin and LIM - kinase to show a physical interaction with cofilin . The fact that Aip1p is highly conserved in eukaryotes suggests that it may be a cofactor for cofilin activity in all eukaryotic cells . Though the mechanistic details of these interactions remain to be elucidated fully , our biochemical data dem - onstrate clearly that Aip1p stimulates cofilin - mediated ac - tin filament disassembly and our genetic and cell biologi - cal data provides powerful evidence for the relevance of this activity in vivo .
