However , the mechanisms underlying β cell failure remain incompletely understood . Here , we report that metabolic stress markedly enhances macroautophagy - independent lysosomal degradation of nascent insulin granules . In different model systems of diabetes including of human origin , stress - induced nascent granule degradation ( SINGD ) contributes to loss of insulin along with mammalian / mechanistic Target of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) - dependent suppression of macroautophagy . Expression of Protein Kinase D ( PKD ) , a negative regulator of SINGD , is reduced in diabetic β cells . Pharmacological activation of PKD counters SINGD and delays the onset of T2D . Conversely , inhibition of PKD exacerbates SINGD , mitigates insulin secretion and accelerates diabetes . Finally , reduced levels of lysosomal tetraspanin CD63 prevent SINGD , leading to increased insulin secretion . Overall , our ﬁ ndings implicate aberrant SINGD in the patho - genesis of diabetes and suggest new therapeutic strategies to prevent β cell failure . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 OPEN 1 Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire , 67404 Illkirch , France . 2 Centre National de la Recherche Scienti ﬁ que , UMR7104 , 67404 Illkirch , France . 3 Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale , U964 , 67404 Illkirch , France . 4 Université de Strasbourg , 67081 Strasbourg , France . 5 Biochemisches Institut , Christian - Albrechts Universität Kiel , D - 24118 Kiel , Germany . 6 Centre Européen d ’ Etude du Diabète ( CEED ) , DIATHEC EA 7294 , F - 67000 Strasbourg , France . 7 Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U1190 , EGID , CHU Lille , University of Lille , 59000 Lille , France . 8 Open Innovation Access Platform , Sano ﬁ - Aventis R & D , 67080 Strasbourg , France . 9 European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Electron Microscopy Core Facility , 69117 Heidelberg , Germany . 10 European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit , 69117 Heidelberg , Germany . 11 Laboratoire de Biochimie et de Biologie Moléculaire , Nouvel Hôpital Civil , 67091 Strasbourg , France . 12 Present address : Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research ; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA 92093 , USA . 13 These authors jointly supervised this work : Alexander Goginashvili , Romeo Ricci .

In complex organisms , these cellular responses are coordinated through hormonal cues with the aim to maintain whole - body metabolic homeostasis . The pancreatic β cell harbors an exemp - lary nutrient sensing machinery coupled to insulin secretion , which controls glucose homeostasis in normal conditions and is disturbed in diabetes . Macroautophagy is a major mechanism used by the cells to remove damaged organelles and unused or aggregated proteins . In addition , it helps maintaining cellular homeostasis and is activated in response to nutrient shortage 1 – 3 . Macroautophagy involves formation of cargo - containing autophagosomes , which is controlled by a complex molecular machinery consisting of the autophagy - related ( ATG ) proteins 4 . Autophagosomes subse - quently fuse with lysosomes to generate autolysosomes in which degradation occurs . Several studies have demonstrated that macroautophagy is crucial to maintain β cell function in response to cellular stress linked to T2D . Evidence for the protective role of macroautophagy has been provided in high - fat diet - induced obesity 5 , 6 , in Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) stress - induced diabetes 7 , 8 , in human islet amyloid polypeptide - induced diabetes 9 – 12 as well as in lipo - and glucotoxicity models 13 – 16 . Importantly , both enhanced 5 , 7 , 15 , 17 and reduced macroautophagy 13 , 16 , 18 have been reported in metabolically challenged β cells . These seemingly controversial observations can be explained by the fact that macroautophagy levels are high and protective in compensated β cells in pre - diabetes , while they decrease at later stages , which contributes to β cell failure . In fact , depending on the nature and duration of metabolic challenges , levels of macroautophagy varied accordingly 15 , 19 . Finally , consistent with perturbed autophagic ﬂ ux , accumulation of autophagosomes has been observed in β cells of islets isolated from T2D patients 20 , 21 . Pancreatic β cells dedicate up to 50 % of their protein bio - synthesis to insulin production 22 , requiring a tight control of insulin granule homeostasis . While mechanisms governing insulin granule biogenesis and exocytosis in response to nutrients were widely investigated 23 , 24 , little is known about how nutrients impact on insulin granule turnover . Targeting of insulin granules to the lysosomes has been reported to occur in autophagosome - dependent and - independent manner 25 – 31 . Recently we have described a macroautophagy - independent mechanism in pancreatic β cells as an immediate response for them to adapt to nutrient depletion 32 . We have demonstrated that nutrient - deprived β cells deliver newly synthesized secretory granules ( SGs ) to lysosomes in the Golgi area , where degradation of their cargo ( proinsulin and insulin ) provides necessary nutri - ents leading to mTOR - mediated suppression of macroautophagy . Starvation - induced nascent granule degradation allows β cells to cope with shortage of nutrients and to prevent unwanted insulin release . As uncontrolled lysosomal degradation of insulin gran - ules may provoke loss of insulin and macroautophagy dysfunc - tion , both of which occur in diabetic β cells , we wondered whether aberrant activation of this pathway might be implicated in β cell failure in T2D . To test this hypothesis , we now focus on several models , including metabolically stressed β cell lines , human and mouse pancreatic islets as well as diabetic mice . In all of these , we ﬁ nd markedly increased lysosomal degradation of nascent insulin granules , which results in depletion of insulin and mTOR - dependent suppression of macroautophagy . As this pathway is not restricted to conditions of nutrient deprivation , we now refer to it as stress - induced nascent granule degradation ( SINGD , pro - nounced ˈ s ɪ ndi ) . Furthermore , we provide evidence in vivo that pharmacological inhibition of SINGD delays onset of T2D , while activation of SINGD accelerates its progression . Finally , we ﬁ nd that the tet - raspanin CD63 determines the destination of nascent insulin granules towards degradation versus secretion . Collectively , our ﬁ ndings delineate a mechanism that links impaired signaling at the Golgi to β cell failure in T2D . Results Metabolic stress enhances SINGD . We ﬁ rst investigated SINGD in β cells upon chronic exposure to elevated levels of Glucose ( Glc ) and Palmitate ( Pal ) , i . e . , glucolipotoxic conditions 33 . We treated rat insulinoma - derived β cells ( INS1 cells ) with 33 . 3 mM Glc and 0 . 4 mM Pal ( Glc / Pal ) or 11 mM Glc ( control growing culture ) for 20 h . We observed that Glc / Pal led to a drastic decrease in insulin - positive SGs at the plasma membrane in comparison to control conditions . Importantly , Glc / Pal - treated cells also accumulated SGs in the Giantin - positive Golgi area ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) prompting us to further char - acterize the latter . Immuno ﬂ uorescence of proinsulin / insulin ( ( pro ) insulin ) and CD63 as markers of SGs and late endosomes / lysosomes respectively , revealed abundant large CD63 puncta , co - localizing with ( pro ) insulin in the Golgi area in Glc / Pal - treated INS1 in comparison to control cells ( Fig . 1b ) . Accordingly , increased co - localization of ( pro ) insulin with another lysosomal marker Lysosomal - Associated Membrane Protein 2 ( LAMP2 ) was found in the Golgi area upon Glc / Pal as compared to control treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings hint at potential induction of SINGD upon glucolipotoxic conditions . To address the dynamics of SINGD in metabolically challenged cells , we generated INS1 cells endogenously expressing the SG marker Phogrin tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) and the lysosomal marker CD63 tagged with Discosoma sp . Red ﬂ uorescent protein ( DsRed ) ( hereafter referred to as INS1 PGCD cells ) . Using CRISPR - Cas9 gene editing 34 , we added sequences coding corresponding ﬂ uorescent proteins to the 3 ′ end of the last exon of PTPRN2 ( or Phogrin ) and CD63 , respectively ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2a – j ) . INS1 PGCD cells contain a homozygous insertion of GFP in the Phogrin locus , and a heterozygous insertion of DsRed in the CD63 locus , con ﬁ rmed by Sanger sequencing and PCR analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , d , g , h ) . The expression of Phogrin - GFP endo was corroborated by immunobloting ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) and cellular localization of Phogrin - GFP endo and CD63 - DsRed endo was con ﬁ rmed by immuno ﬂ uorescence and correlative light and electron micro - scopy ( CLEM ) ( Supplementary Fig . 2e , i , j ) . In line with SINGD triggered by starvation 32 , INS1 PGCD cells demonstrated increased Phogrin / CD63 co - localization upon nutrient deprivation as compared to control conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Accord - ingly , inhibition of Protein Kinase D ( PKD ) , a major negative regulator of SINGD 32 , using the selective PKD inhibitor CID755673 35 also resulted in increased Phogrin / CD63 co - localization ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Time - lapse microscopy of INS1 PGCD cells treated with Glc / Pal revealed a marked increase in Phogrin / CD63 co - localization starting already after 6 h of treatment ( Fig . 1c ) . Interestingly , INS1 PGCD cells treated separately with Glc or Pal also demonstrated increased Pho - grin / CD63 co - localization indicating that various inducers of metabolic stress are capable to trigger SINGD ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . We next tested whether SINGD induced by Glc / Pal occurred via macroautophagy . To this end , we followed SG markers , ( pro ) insulin and Phogrin , in INS1 LC3B - GFPendo cells endogenously expressing LC3B tagged with GFP 32 , a marker for autophagic ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 3312 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications intermediate compartments – autophagosomes 36 . While we observed occasional autophagosomes containing SGs in control - treated cells , the amount of SG - positive autophagosomes was almost abolished upon Glc / Pal treatment , suggesting that SINGD does not rely on macroautophagy ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . We next monitored SINGD upon downregulation of the major canonical macroautophagy genes atg5 and beclin1 ( becn1 ) that play a crucial role in early steps of the macroautophagy pathway by controlling the biogenesis of autophagosomes 4 . The lysosomal v - ATPase inhibitor Ba ﬁ lomycin A1 ( BafA1 ) counters lysosome activity and prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes 37 , 38 , and thus is routinely used to measure autophagic ﬂ ux . As expected , silencing of atg5 and beclin1 led to a drastic decrease in the number of LC3B - GFP - positive puncta in BafA1 - treated Glc / Pal - treated INS1 LC3B - GFPendo cells , indi - cating that early steps of macroautophagy were inhibited prior formation of autophagosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 4c , d ) . However , in line with macroautophagy - independent SINGD 32 , silencing of atg5 and beclin1 did not lead to any decrease in Phogrin / CD63 co - localization upon Glc / Pal ( Supplementary Fig . 4e – g ) . d 3 2 G l c / P a l - t r ea t ed I N S 1 P G CD 1 1 2 3 S e c r e t o r y g r anu l e L ys o s o m e G r anu l e - c on t a i n i ng l ys o s o m e ( G C L ) Phogrin - GFP Phogrin - GFP endo CD63 - DsRed CD63 - DsRed endo e 0 1 2 3 4 5 G C L s / c e ll v i e w * * * 1 % BSA Glc / Pal 72 h H u m an i s l e t s a ( Pro ) insulin 1 % BSA G l c / P a l Giantin ( Pro ) insulin GiantinDAPI 0 2 4 6 * * C o - l o c a li z a t i on ( p r o ) i n s u li n / CD 63 , e v en t s pe r c e ll v i e w 1 % BSA CD63 b ( Pro ) insulin ( Pro ) insulinCD63 Golgi - CFP 1 % BSA G l c / P a l 0 . 4 P CC s f o r p i x e l s abo v e t h r e s ho l d s * * 12 h c CD 63 - D s R ed endo M e r ge Glc / Pal treatment Phogrin - GFP endo CD63 - DsRed endo 0 h 6 h 9 h 3 h INS1 cells endogenously expressing Phogrin - GFP and CD63 - DsRed ( INS1 PGCD ) P hog r i n - G F P endo 1 % BSA 1 % BSA Glc / Pal 0 . 6 0 . 0 0 . 2 Glc / Pal Glc / Pal Fig . 1 Targeting of secretory granules to lysosomes in response to glucolipotoxicity in β cells . a Immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) of insulin + proinsulin ( “ ( pro ) insulin ” ) ( green ) and giantin ( red ) in INS1 cells treated with control ( 1 % BSA , 11mM glucose , “ 1 % BSA ” ) or glucolipotoxic ( 1 % BSA , 33 . 3mM Glucose and 0 . 4mM Palmitate , “ Glc / Pal ” ) media for 20h .

If Glc / Pal - induced delivery of SGs to lysosomes occurred via autophagosomes , BafA1 treatment would lead to accumulation of SG - containing autophagosomes in the cyto - plasm , preventing delivery to CD63 - positive lysosomes . However , we observed the opposite : the LC3B - positive / CD63 - negative autophagosomes did not contain SGs ; and the size and amount of co - localized Phogrin / CD63 signals was further increased upon BafA1 , overall corroborating macroautophagy - independent SINGD ( Supplementary Fig . 4i , j ) . We next used correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) to follow SINGD at the ultrastructural level . First , CLEM of Glc / Pal - treated INS1 PGCD cells con ﬁ rmed large CD63 - and Phogrin - positive granule - containing lysosomes ( GCLs ) ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Second , live - cell imaging followed by CLEM ( live - CLEM ) identi ﬁ ed that GCLs were formed via direct fusion between SGs and lysosomes ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5b and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Finally , β cells of primary human islets , treated with Glc / Pal for 72 h contained abundant GCLs in the Golgi area , as revealed by quantitative Electron Microscopy ( EM ) analysis ( Fig . 1f ) . Alto - gether , our data indicate that prolonged exposure of β cells to Glc / Pal diverts SGs from the secretory route to lysosomes in a macroautophagy - independent manner . mTOR suppresses macroautophagy upon metabolic stress . Activation of mammalian / mechanistic Target of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) Complex 1 occurs at the lysosomal membrane in response to addition of amino acids 39 – 41 . We have recently shown that SINGD triggered by starvation was associated with increased recruitment of mTOR to GCLs , mTOR activation and suppression of macroautophagy via mTOR - mediated inhibitory phosphoryla - tion of Unc - 51 – like kinase 1 ( ULK1 ) 32 . We thus next asked whether nutrient stress imposed by Glc / Pal treatment evoked similar effects . In fact , prolonged Glc / Pal treatment was shown to induce macroautophagy dysfunction in a mTOR - dependent manner 13 , 16 . We observed that Glc / Pal recruited mTOR to CD63 - positive lysosomes in INS1 cells ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Movie 2 ) and increased phospho - ULK1 ( Fig . 2b ) . Moreover , INS1 LC3B - GFPendo cells treated with Glc / Pal for 20 h contained less LC3B - GFP puncta as compared to control - treated cells ( Fig . 2c ) . Accordingly , immunoblotting revealed a decrease in lipidated autophagosomal LC3B - II in Glc / Pal - treated INS1 cells and primary human islets as compared to control conditions . This difference was evident in the presence and absence of BafA1 , indicating reduced autophagy ﬂ ux ( Fig . 2d , quanti ﬁ ed in Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Consistent with mTOR - mediated suppression of macro - autophagy in Glc / Pal - treated cells , the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin increased LC3B - GFP puncta in Glc / Pal - treated INS1 LC3B - GFPendo cells ( Fig . 2e ) . Altogether , these data indicate that lysosomal degradation of SGs is likely to contribute to mTOR - dependent suppression of macroautophagy in metabolically stressed β cells . b c GAPDH LC3B - I LC3B - II INS1 cells Human islets LC3B - I GAPDH LC3B - II 1 % BSA Glc / Pal Baf A1 – + – + 1 % BSA Glc / Pal Baf A1 – + – + 1 % BSA G l c / P a l mTOR CD63 a Merge CD63CD63mTORmTOR Golgi - CFP Golgi - CFP LC3B - GFP endo 1 % BSA G l c / P a l L C 3 B - G F P end o pun c t a pe r c e ll v i e w 1 % BSA Glc / Pal * * * 0 5 10 15 * * * * * d * * * DMSO Rapamycin LC3B - GFPendo L C 3 B - G F P endo pun c t a pe r c e ll v i e w 1 % BSA DMSO 1 % BSA rapamycin Glc / Pal DMSO Glc / Pal rapamycin 051015 20 25 n . s . 1 % BSA G l c / P a l e S757 - ULK1 Tubulin 1 % BSA Glc / Pal 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 1 % BSA Glc / Pal S 757 - U L K 1 / t ubu li n * 15 15 35 35 130 55 Fig . 2 Glucolipotoxicity leads to mTOR - dependent inhibition of macroautophagy in β cells . a Immuno ﬂ uorescence of CD63 ( green ) and mTOR ( red ) in INS1 cells treated with control ( 1 % BSA , 11 mM glucose , “ 1 % BSA ” ) or glucolipotoxic ( 1 % BSA , 33 . 3 mM Glucose and 0 . 4 mM Palmitate , “ Glc / Pal ” ) media for 20 h .

We have identi ﬁ ed enhanced SINGD in β cell lines and primary islets treated under gluco - and lipotoxic conditions . To extend and con ﬁ rm these ﬁ ndings in vivo we subjected mice to a metabolic stress by feeding animals a high - fat diet ( HFD ) for 13 weeks ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) , and analyzed the frequency of fusion events between lysosomes and SGs in β cells . In line with above ﬁ ndings , EM and IF analysis of β cells of HFD - fed mice revealed higher numbers of GCLs , as well as co - localized ( pro ) insulin / CD63 indicating increased SINGD ( Supplementary Fig . 7c , d ) . We then decided to study SINGD in a model of T2D , leptin - de ﬁ cient ob / ob mice in a BTBR genetic background ( BTBR ob / ob ) 42 . The BTBR ob / ob mice develop severe hyperglycemia and diabetes between 6 and 8 weeks of age 42 ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . β - cells in islets of 8 - week - old BTBR ob / ob mice contained less ( pro ) insulin - positive puncta in comparison to non - diabetic control mice ( BTBR + / + mice ) . Strikingly , these residual puncta largely co - localized with CD63 ( Fig . 3a ) . Furthermore , quantitative EM con ﬁ rmed reduced SG abundance and revealed a marked increase in GCLs in the Golgi area of β cells in islets of 6 - week - old BTBR ob / ob mice as compared to control mice ( Fig . 3b ) . Finally , 3D EM reconstruction using Focused Ion Beam Scanning EM corroborated abundant GCLs in Golgi area of diabetic β cells ( Fig . 3c , d and Supplementary Movie 3 ) .

Our ﬁ ndings provide strong evidence for increased SINGD in diabetic β cells . However , it is unclear whether SINGD observed upon Glc / Pal treatment as well as in diabetic or metabolically stressed mice contributes to β cell failure per se or represents a secondary event - for example , a removal of excessive SGs due to perturbed insulin secretion . To distinguish between these possibilities , it is necessary to follow SGs traf ﬁ cking and release in conditions where SINGD is prevented . We have previously found that SINGD is controlled by PKD1 : while inhibition or decreased expression of PKD1 induces SINGD , high PKD1 activity counters SINGD 32 . Indeed , induction of SINGD by inhibition of PKD resulted in a decrease of insulin and proinsulin in human pancreatic islets ( Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , consulting a published study comparing genome - wide mRNA expression in non - diabetic BTBR + / + and diabetic BTBR ob / ob mice 45 , revealed a decrease in PKD1 mRNA abundance in diabetic islets ( Supple - mentary Fig . 10 ) . Similarly , in line with decreased PKD1 trig - gering SINGD in diabetic β cells , we found a marked reduction in mRNA and protein levels of PKD1 in islets of diabetic 8 - week - old BTBR ob / ob mice as compared to age - matched control mice ( Fig . 4b , c ) . We thus decided to test whether PKD activation prevented SINGD in diabetes . Mitogen - Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) p38 δ negatively regulates PKD1 , and loss or reduction of p38 δ results in increased activity of PKD1 , which counters SINGD 32 , 46 . We generated a Compound A , which selectively inhibited p38 δ and activated PKD ( Fig . 4d , Supplementary Fig . 11a – c ) . Com - pound A decreased GCLs and increased SGs in Glc / Pal - treated INS1 PGCD cells ( Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , phospho - PKD , proinsulin and insulin levels were increased in Compound A - treated human pancreatic islets isolated from non - diabetic donors ( Fig . 4f , g , quanti ﬁ ed in Supplementary Fig . 11d ) . In addition , Compound A increased insulin levels in islets isolated from T2D patients ( Fig . 4h , quanti ﬁ ed in Supplementary Fig . 11d ) . Importantly , while p38 δ is abundantly expressed in pancreas , no expression of p38 δ has been detected in insulin - sensitive organs such as adipose tissue and liver 46 , prompting us to address the effects of Compound A on SINGD in vivo . We thus infused Compound A or a control solution into 4 - week - old BTBR ob / ob mice for 2 weeks using osmotic pumps and followed blood glucose levels over time . As expected , fasting blood glucose levels progressively increased in control - treated BTBR ob / ob mice , indicating the onset of diabetes . However , glucose levels in Compound A - treated BTBR ob / ob mice were lower than in control - treated animals indicating protection against diabetes ( Fig . 4i ) . In strong contrast , systemic inhibition of PKD using the compound CID755673 accelerated onset of diabetes in BTBR ob / ob mice , as evidenced by increased fasting blood glucose ( Fig . 4j ) and decreased insulin secretion in response to glucose injections ( Supplementary Fig . 12a ) . Strikingly , upon islet isolation , it was evident that islets from CID755673 - treated mice were pale to transparent as compared to yellow to golden islets from control - treated mice ( Supplementary Fig . 12b ) , a phenotype hinting at the loss of insulin 47 . Accordingly , insulin levels were markedly decreased in islets of CID755673 - treated mice ( Supplementary Fig . 12c ) . In contrast , the numbers of GCLs were increased in β cells of islets isolated from CID755673 - treated BTBR ob / ob mice as compared to control solution - treated BTBR ob / ob mice ( Supple - mentary Fig . 12d ) . Collectively , these data suggest that reducing PKD activity in vivo is suf ﬁ cient to trigger SINGD in β cells , while PKD activity prevents SINGD and protects against β cell dysfunction . Accordingly , the observed reduced PKD expression in diabetic islets is likely to contribute to enhanced SINGD in β cells in diabetes . Even though a direct implication of enhanced SINGD to β cell failure in vivo is to be substantiated , its link to reduced insulin content , compromised macroautophagy and insulin secretion is suggestive for such a scenario . Stress - induced nascent granule degradation requires CD63 . Our above ﬁ ndings reveal that reduced PKD activity trig - gers SINGD , while enhanced PKD activity prevents SINGD . Mechanistically , SINGD is manifested as delivery of SGs to CD63 - positive lysosomes in Glc / Pal - treated β cells and in β cells of BTBR ob / ob mice . Interestingly , we noticed that transient overexpression of CD63 resulted in a marked depletion of SGs upon Glc / Pal treatment , suggesting that CD63 might mediate SINGD ( Fig . 5a ) . Of note , while the deletion of the lysosomal proteins LIMP2 and LAMP2 was associated with severe lysosomal dysfunction 48 , 49 , mice lacking CD63 demonstrated normal overall lysosome function 50 . Therefore , we decided to investigate secretion and degradation of SGs in the absence of CD63 . To address the role of CD63 in SINGD , we ﬁ rst transfected INS1 cells with siRNA against Cd63 or non - silencing ( NS ) siRNA and incubated cells in the media with or without Glc / Pal for 20 h . In control cells , transfected with NS siRNA , Glc / Pal treatment led to a decrease in ( pro ) insulin signals in the plasma membrane area . In contrast , SG localization remained largely unchanged in Glc / Pal - treated CD63 - knockdown cells ( Fig . 5b ) , indicating that SINGD was mediated by CD63 . Furthermore , immunoblotting revealed a drop in proinsulin levels upon Glc / Pal treatment in control - transfected cells , but not in CD63 - knockdown cells ( Fig . 5c ) . To directly test whether SINGD induced by reduction of PKD requires CD63 , we examined SINGD in INS1 cells stably expressing shRNA against Prkd1 ( shPKD1 ) in the presence and absence of CD63 . As expected , INS1 cells lacking PKD1 con - tained few SGs and displayed large CD63 puncta co - localizing with residual SGs ( Fig . 5d ) . However , siRNA - mediated depletion of CD63 from PKD1 - knockdown cells prevented loss of SGs , indicating that CD63 mediates PKD1 - controlled SINGD ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Our above ﬁ ndings suggest that depletion of CD63 allows SGs to escape degradation and to reach the plasma membrane , pos - sibly for secretion . Therefore , lowering CD63 levels is expected to increase insulin secretion . To address the latter point , we next compared insulin secretion from islets derived from Cd63 knockout ( Cd63 − / − mice ) 50 and wild - type Cd63 + / + mice . Con - sistent with reduced SINGD , quantitative EM analysis revealed a decrease in the number of GCLs in the Golgi area , and an increase in the number of SGs associated with the plasma membrane in β cells of islets isolated from Cd63 − / − mice ( Supplementary Fig . 13a , b ) . To test the effects of Cd63 deletion on insulin secretion upon a metabolic challenge , we also treated Cd63 + / + and Cd63 − / − islets with Glc / Pal for 48 h . While this treatment did not abrogate GSIS in control islets , it led to a decrease in total insulin content , most likely due to increased secretion of insulin during incubation with Glc / Pal ( Supplementary Fig . 13c ) . Strik - ingly , Cd63 − / − islets demonstrated a two - fold increase in GSIS under both control and Glc / Pal treatment conditions ( Fig . 5f ) . Total insulin levels were similar in metabolically challenged Cd63 + / + and Cd63 − / − islets ( Supplementary Fig . 13c ) , suggesting that SGs escaped from SINGD in Cd63 − / − β cells and instead were secreted . Taken together , our data demonstrate that β cells developed complex machinery at the Golgi that controls targeting of insulin granules towards secretion or lysosomal degradation . Nutrient stress - imposed PKD deregulation triggers SINGD at least partially in a CD63 - dependent manner . This mechanism may contribute to insulin loss , reduced secretory capacity and to decreased macroautophagy , hallmarks of β cell dysfunction in T2D ( Fig . 5g ) .

In normal fed state , PKD1 promotes secretory granule biogenesis and sorting towards secretion , SINGD is low . However , in T2D , a decrease in PKD1 leads to the CD63 - dependent targeting of the newly formed granules to the CD63 - positive lysosomes instead of secretion . As a result , mTORC1 is recruited to the membrane of the granule - containing lysosomes , and its chronic activation leads to inhibition of the housekeeping process of macroautophagy . Thus , aberrant activation of SINGD contributes to β cell failure in T2D ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 3312 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications processing and sorting 61 , 62 and basal hypersecretion 63 . SINGD can now be considered as a new mechanism with potential to contribute to insulin depletion , but whether SINGD constitutes a major pathway leading to loss of insulin in T2D will require its quanti ﬁ cation versus the other possibilities in future studies . It is also important to mention that our results do not exclude the possibility that a small portion of byproducts of degradation might be released from cells . For example , aberrant lysosomal secretion might be an additional potential mechanism of insulin loss induced by SINGD . Interestingly , proinsulin , the major cargo in nascent granules , is released in higher amounts in diabetic patients 64 , 65 . Furthermore , recent studies identi ﬁ ed that partially degraded granule proteins including products of insulin degra - dation might be released from diabetic β cells 66 , 67 . Several potential mechanisms leading to impaired β cell mac - roautophagy in T2D have been proposed , including defects in autophagosome / lysosome fusion 13 , 16 , 18 , 19 and more broadly , primary defects in lysosomal function 20 . Our data hint at impaired β cell macroautophagy in T2D as a consequence of mTOR - dependent reduction in autophagosome formation in response to increased SINGD . Importantly , recent studies have also established the role of mTOR in more distal steps of macroautophagy 68 , 69 suggesting that SINGD - mTOR - induced inhibition of macroautophagy may not be limited to reducing autophagosome formation . Genetically induced mTORC1 hyperactivity has been reported to be deleterious and to promote onset of diabetes in vivo due to compromised macroautophagy 52 . Importantly , chronic mTORC1 inactivation also led to rapid onset or aggravation of diabetes 70 , 71 . Mechanistically , mTORC1 inactivation mainly impaired β cell compensation in response to metabolic stress . Together with our ﬁ ndings , these data argue for a model in which nutrient - dependent switching between high and low mTORC1 activity promoting β cell growth / proliferation or macroautophagy , respectively , is crucial to maintain β cell function 72 . This model is also supported by a recent report demonstrating that intermittent fasting promoted resistance against ageing and diabetes 73 . Our previous work unveiled that β cells utilize SINGD in response to nutrient deprivation , thereby suppressing macro - autophagy 32 . An aberrant activation of SINGD in diabetic con - ditions somehow parallels one of the hallmarks of T2D , which is constitutive induction of fasting - related processes , i . e . , gluco - neogenesis and lipolysis , in a situation of nutrient overload . Although the latter phenomena are related to insulin resistance 74 as well as hyperglucagonaemia 75 , it remains unclear , how nutrient deprivation and nutrient excess both can trigger SINGD in β cells . It will be important to understand mechanistically how these seemingly opposing nutrient stresses both converge into reduced PKD activity at the TGN triggering SINGD . Studies from our group and others have previously implicated perturbed Protein Kinase D activity in the pathogenesis of T2D 46 , 76 – 79 . Furthermore , PRKD1 ( human PKD ) was identi ﬁ ed in several genome - wide associated studies as a Body Mass Index - associated locus 80 – 82 as well as T2D - associated locus 83 . Our ﬁ ndings establish decreased PKD as a trigger for SINGD in dia - betic β cells of mice and humans , thus suggesting a mechanistic explanation for compromised PKD activity contributing to T2D . Our study also provides evidence for tetraspanin CD63 to be an essential component for targeting insulin granules to the lyso - somes ( Fig . 5g ) . Although high CD63 levels induce SINGD , depletion of CD63 in β cell lines and in islets prevents SINGD , restoring the pool of SGs . CD63 has been previously implicated in the sorting and targeting of various substrates to the endolyso - somal system 84 – 86 . How does PKD activity limit CD63 - mediated SINGD ? According to one potential scenario , granules routed to lysosomes may lack PKD - dependent signals generated at the Golgi that prevent CD63 - dependent fusion with lysosomes . In other words , CD63 might be a necessary component on lyso - somes independent of PKD activity but whether or not fusion occurs might be dictated by PKD - dependent signals on the insulin granule . Alternatively , PKD may also more directly inhibit CD63 function on lysosomes or other lysosomal proteins that are required for fusion to occur . Future efforts will be necessary to test the above models . Hence , unraveling of detailed molecular mechanisms of SINGD will be required to address a more direct physiological impact of the SINGD pathway on β cell function and glucose homeostasis in vivo . What is the place of SINGD in the context of known and putative degradation mechanisms ? Our ﬁ ndings demonstrate that SINGD occurs via direct fusion of nascent SGs with lysosomes . Seminal electron microscopy studies performed in various secretory cells , including cells of the anterior pituitary gland 87 , pancreatic α cells 88 , and β cells 89 had presented strong evidence for selective fusion between secretory granules and lysosomes , which in some cases correlated with conditions of perturbed secretion . This process was designated as crinophagy to distin - guish it from canonical autophagy ( macroautophagy ) 90 . Csiz - madia et al . have recently presented an extensive analysis of molecular mechanisms of crinophagy in the salivary gland of Drosophila , further highlighting the evolutionary importance of this pathway independent of macroautophagy 91 . The relevance of these ﬁ ndings in the context of p38 δ / PKD - and CD63 - dependent SINGD remains to be established . Recently , a study by Riahi et al . performed in β cells over - expressing markers of SGs , macroautophagy as well as lysosomes claimed that macroautophagy was a major pathway through which insulin granules were degraded 30 . According to our data , this is not the case for SINGD . Yet , none of our ﬁ ndings con - tradicts the possibility that insulin SGs may eventually be deliv - ered to lysosomes via autophagosomes along with other cytosolic material . Indeed , double - membrane autophagosomes containing SGs have been reported to occur in β cells 28 . Importantly how - ever , a large body of evidence in our and other studies demon - strates that targeting of secretory granules to lysosomes can occur independent of canonical macroautophagy 25 , 26 , 28 , 31 , 32 , 87 , 91 . Fur - thermore , if macroautophagy was mainly responsible for SGs degradation , macroautophagy - de ﬁ cient β cells would be expected to accumulate SGs , but not to lose them as observed by Riahi et al . and in other studies 5 , 30 , 44 . In addition , consistent with our own ﬁ ndings , Riahi et al . observed that treatment of β cells with BafA1 resulted in marked increase in co - localization of insulin granules with lysosomes . Among other effects , BafA1 blocks fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes 37 , 38 ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) which prevents autophagosomal delivery of insulin granules to lysosomes . Finally , our data strongly indicate that SINGD induced by glucolipotoxicity does not require the macro - autophagy machinery , as silencing of major macroautophagy genes atg5 and beclin1 has virtually no effect on SINGD . Interestingly , a recent study has reported that secretory gran - ules might be delivered to lysosomes via autophagosome - like structures originating at the Golgi in β cells devoid of factors required for autophagosome formation ( ATG5 and ATG7 ) 31 . Strikingly , both Golgi membrane - associated degradation ( GOMED ) and SINGD occur in lysosomes adjacent to the Golgi area independent of the classical macroautophagy machinery . However , three important aspects distinguish GOMED from direct fusion of insulin granules with lysosomes as a mechanism underlying SINGD : ( 1 ) GOMED is a feature in cells lacking the canonical macroautophagy machinery . ( 2 ) Direct fusion of insulin granules with lysosomes does not rely on autophagosome - like intermediates to target SGs to lysosomes . ( 3 ) GOMED is not restricted to degradation of insulin granules but is also a way to NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 3312 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 target for example mitochondria to lysosomal degradation in the absence of canonical macroautophagy . Collectively , the delivery of insulin granules to lysosomes can be achieved by several mechanisms including macroautophagy and macroautophagy - like pathways . However , our ﬁ ndings indicate that starvation - or metabolic stress - induced SINGD is macroautophagy - independent and even inhibits macroautophagy through mTORC1 activation . Our current study together with our and others ’ published evidence 31 , 32 demonstrate that β cells tightly control the fate of newly formed cargo - containing carriers . On the cellular level , this means that SGs on their route to the plasma membrane need to bypass the lysosomes in the Golgi area . In light of the well - known mechanisms of protein quality control in endoplasmic reticulum ( ERAD ) , it is tempting to speculate that the SINGD pathway might play a similar role at the Golgi : SGs incapable of interacting with the secretory traf ﬁ cking machinery , or containing wrong cargos , etc . might need to be ef ﬁ ciently cleared to prevent ‘ clog - ging ’ of the Golgi area with non - functional byproducts of secre - tion . Our data indicate that SINGD is relatively low under basal conditions , and it is markedly enhanced upon nutrient stress , leading to depletion of SGs . The comparison between SGs tar - geted for degradation and SGs involved in secretion remains to be done . Nonetheless , in line with this hypothesis , enhanced degradation of SGs was previously observed in models of per - turbed insulin release , and was therefore considered as a means to counter - balance SG accumulation 28 , 92 . Importantly , however , our study suggests that aberrant SINGD might be directly involved in the pathogenesis of T2D : ﬁ rst , we observed an exacerbation of T2D upon triggering SINGD and second , preventing SINGD by keeping PKD active or by reducing the levels of CD63 restored the SG pool and insulin secretion . Altogether , our ﬁ ndings demonstrate that , under diabetic conditions , stress - induced nascent granule degradation ( SINGD ) interferes with the protective role of macroautophagy in β cells , which may contribute to premature β cell failure in T2D . Our study also links lysosomal degradation of SGs to β cell failure and provides the ﬁ rst steps towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of the SINGD pathway , suggesting potential ther - apeutic avenues in T2D .

INS1 cells were plated on 9 – 15 mm glass coverslips ( Menzel - Glaser ) in 24 - well tissue culture plates and allowed to grow for 24 h . In the end of experiment the cells were washed once with PBS and ﬁ xed for 20 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS at room temperature . The cov - erslips were rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5min . After rinsing three times with PBS , the coverslips were incubated in Image - iT ® Fx Signal enhancer for 30min , rinsed once with PBS and incubated for 30min in blocking buffer ( 3 % BSA in PBS ) . Coverslips were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature , rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies , diluted in blocking buffer , for 40 min at room temperature in the dark .

Ultrathin sections ( 50 nm ) were picked up on 1 % pioloform NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 3312 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 11170 - 4 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 coated copper slot grids and observed with a Philips CM12 operated at 80kV equipped with an Orius SC100 CDD camera ( Gatan , Pleasanton , USA ) . Quantitative analysis of granule - containing lysosomes , lysosomes , and insulin granules of INS1 cells and primary islets has been assessed by TEM as in Goginashvili et al . 32 . In brief , the areas of cytoplasm and Golgi were evaluated by stereological approach using ×5600 magni ﬁ cation with ImageJ - based open source Fiji software package . The numbers of compartments were quanti ﬁ ed using ×15 , 000 or ×19 , 500 magni ﬁ cation . Data from three independent experiments were expressed as mean±SEM . All quantitative analyses relied on systematic uniform random sampling . CLEM . Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy ( CLEM ) was performed as in Lenormand et al . 94 . In brief , INS1 cells were cultured on laser micro - patterned Aclar supports . In the end of experiment , the cells were ﬁ xed in PFA 4 % , Glu - taraldehyde 0 . 5 % in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer 0 . 1M for 20min at room temperature , followed by incubation in sodium cacodylate 0 . 1M . Cells of interest were selected , precisely located and imaged by ﬂ uorescence confocal microscopy using Leica Spinning Disk Andor / Yokogawa microscope . Samples were then processed exactly as for TEM . Live - CLEM . INS1 cells were cultured on gridded coverslips ( MatTek P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - C - GRID ) . Live - cell imaging was performed using Inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope ( Nikon Ti PFS Spinning Disk ) equipped with x100 TIRF objective ( NA = 1 . 49 ) , with the PFS ( perfect focus system ) , an EMCCD camera ( Evolve , Pho - tometrics ) and Yokogawa CSU - X1 Confocal Scanner . GFP and m - Cherry were excited with a 488 - nm and a 561 - nm laser , respectively ( 100mW ) . Live INS1 cells were imaged at 20 frames per second . 4D imaging was performed using consecutive xy ( c ) tz time - lapse acquisitions . Time series of 2D sections were analyzed using FIJI and IMARIS software . In the end of experiment , the cells were immediately ﬁ xed in PFA 2 . 5 % , Glutaraldehyde 2 . 5 % in sodium cacodylate 0 . 1M for 20min at room temperature . The samples were then post ﬁ xed in 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4°C , dehydrated through graded alcohol ( 50 , 70 , 90 , and 100 % ) , embedded in Epon 812 cut at 70 nm ( Leica Ultracut UCT ) and con - trasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . Serial sections were examined using a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope ( CM12 , Philips ; FEI Electron Optics , Eindhoven , the Netherlands ) operated at 80kV and equipped with an Orius 1000 CCD camera ( Gatan , Pleasanton , USA ) . On - section CLEM . High accuracy on - section CLEM was performed as previously described 95 , 96 , with minor modi ﬁ cations . Cells grown on sapphire disks ( Engi - neering Of ﬁ ce M . Wohlwend GmbH , Sennwald , Switzerland ) were high pressure frozen with a BAL - TEC HPM 010 machine . Freeze substitution ( FS ) and resin in ﬁ ltration were performed in a Leica AFS2 machine . Cells monolayers were freeze substituted with 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate in acetone for 9 h at − 90 °C . The temperature was then increased ( 5 °C / h ) to − 45 °C and samples were incubated for 5h . The FS solution was then washed out with dry acetone and samples were in ﬁ ltrated with Lowicryl HM20 ( Polyscience Europe GmbH , Eppelheim , Germany ) at increasing concentration ( 10 % , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % , 3× 100 % ) , while the temperature was increased to − 25°C . The resin was then polymerized under UV light for 48h . In all , 300 - nm - thick sections were cut from the polymerized resin block and picked up on carbon coated mesh grids . TetraSpeck ﬂ uorescent microspheres ( 100nm ) ( Lifetechnologies ) were adsorbed to the grid for the subsequent ﬁ ducial - based correlation between light ( LM ) and electron microscopy ( EM ) images . Fluores - cence imaging of the sections was performed as in Kukulski et al . 95 using an Olympus ScanR microscope and a 100 × 1 . 4NA oil objective . Tilt series of the areas with ﬂ uorescent structures of interest were acquired with a FEI Tecnai F30 electron microscope . Tomograms were then reconstructed using the IMOD software package 97 . Correlation of LM and EM images was performed by manually assigning the position of tetraspecks in the two imaging modalities using ec - CLEM plugin 98 from ICY software 99 . FIB - SEM . Freshly isolated pancreatic islets were ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % Glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , 0 . 1 % Malachite green oxalate ( Sigma ) in 0 . 1 M PHEM buffer . Subsequently , islets were washed with 0 . 1M PHEM buffer and stored at 4°C until further processing in a PELCO BioWave Pro microwave processor ( Ted Pella , Inc . ) 100 . The processing procedure was as follows : post - ﬁ xation with 1 % osmium tetroxide ( OsO 4 ; Electron Microscopy Sciences ) + 0 . 8 % potassium hexacyanoferrate ( III ) ( K 3 Fe ( CN ) 6 ; Merck ) in H 2 O , rinsed with H 2 O , post - stained with 1 % tannic acid , rinsed with H 2 O , en bloc stained with 0 . 5 % UA in H 2 O , rinsed with H 2 O , dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol ( 25 , 50 , 75 , 90 , and 100 % ) and embedded with a graded series of Durcupan ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Subsequently the Durcupan in ﬁ ltrated islets were incubated at 60°C for 48h to polymerize the resin . Once polymerized , resin embedded islets were trimmed to expose two surfaces of material . After trimming , the samples were mounted onto the edge of an SEM stub ( Agar Scienti ﬁ c ) with silver conductive epoxy ( CircuitWorks ) with one of the trimmed surfaces facing up so that it was perpendicular to the focused ion beam ( FIB ) . The sample was then sputter coated with gold ( 180s at 30mA ) in a Quorum Q150RS coater before being placed in the Zeiss Auriga 60 focused ion beam scanning electron microscope ( FIB - SEM ) . Once the ROI was located in the sample , Atlas3D software ( Fibics Inc . and Zeiss ) was used to perform sample preparation and 3D acquisitions . First a platinum pro - tective coat of ( 20 µm×20µm ) was deposited with 1nA FIB current . A small rough trench was then milled to expose the imaging cross - section with 16 nA FIB current , followed with a polish at 4nA . The 3D acquisition milling was done with 1nA FIB current . For SEM imaging , the beam was operated at 1 . 5kV with 60 µm aperture using High Current mode and the EsB detector ( 1 . 1kV collector voltage ) at a dwell time from 10 µs with no line averaging over a pixel size of 4× 4nm and slice thickness 8nm . All acquired images were then combined as a stack with FIJI ( ImageJ ) and subsequently aligned using the TrakEM2 plugin . Finally , the contrast of all images was inverted to have the same contrast as that of conventional TEM images . Generation of Compound A selectively inhibiting MAPK p38 δ . Following the screening of a set of 808 000 compounds from the Sano ﬁ proprietary compound collection using a HTRF assay on puri ﬁ ed p38 δ with ATF2 as substrate , com - pounds of the pyrimido - azepinone family were identi ﬁ ed as moderate inhibitors of p38 δ . After a short chemical optimization cycle , Compound A ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) was selected as a tool compound to study the effects of p38 δ inhibition in various in vitro assays and on blood glucose levels in BTBR ob / ob mice described in this paper . Compound A demonstrated a very good selectivity pro ﬁ le versus p38 α and PKD1 , as measured by mobility shift assays ( Caliper ) while it showed an equivalent inhibitory effect against p38 γ ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . Furthermore , Compound A exhibited a very good selectivity pro ﬁ le in a panel of 60 kinases ( Supplementary Fig . 11c ) with the exception of p70S6K ( 59 % inhibition at 10 μ M ) and mTOR ( 48 % inhibition at 10 μ M ) . Inhibition of p38 γ was also con ﬁ rmed in this panel ( alias SAPK3 : 64 % inhibition at 10 μ M ) . A more detailed account of the discovery , chemistry and biochemical properties of this novel class of selective p38 δ inhibitors will be given elsewhere . Statistical analysis . Sample sizes for all types of experiments in this study were chosen according to published guidelines and to our previous experience . In all imaging - based quantitative experiments , systematic uniform random sampling was used . The statistical signi ﬁ cance of the differences between two groups was investigated by t - test or by Mann – Whitney U - test . At least three independent experiments were performed for each comparison . The statistical analysis was performed using Excel or GraphPad Prism software ( GraphPad Software Inc . ) .
