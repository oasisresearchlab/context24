Cleaver , September 12 , 2011 ( sent for review August 1 , 2011 ) Squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) are one of the most frequent forms of human malignancy , but , other than TP53 mutations , few causative somatic aberrations have been identi ﬁ ed . We identi ﬁ ed NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 mutations in ∼ 75 % of cutaneous SCCs and in a lesser fraction of lung SCCs , de ﬁ ning a spectrum for the most prevalent tumor suppressor speci ﬁ c to these epithelial malignan - cies . Notch receptors normally transduce signals in response to ligands on neighboring cells , regulating metazoan lineage selec - tion and developmental patterning . Our ﬁ ndings therefore illus - trate a central role for disruption of microenvironmental com - munication in cancer progression . NOTCH aberrations include frameshift and nonsense mutations leading to receptor trunca - tions as well as point substitutions in key functional domains that abrogate signaling in cell - based assays . Oncogenic gain - of - func - tion mutations in NOTCH1 commonly occur in human T - cell lym - phoblastic leukemia / lymphoma and B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia . The bifunctional role of Notch in human cancer thus emphasizes the context dependency of signaling outcomes and suggests that targeted inhibition of the Notch pathway may in - duce squamous epithelial malignancies . cancer genetics | genomic | cellular signaling S quamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) collectively are the most common ectodermal cancers , resulting in > 300 , 000 deaths per year ( 1 , 2 ) . SCCs arise from renewable squamous epithelial cells that serve to create an environmental barrier in the skin , esophagus , lung , and cervix . In normal squamous epithelia , basal progenitors give rise to more super ﬁ cial daughter cells that ter - minally differentiate into keratinized cells as they migrate toward the surface , coupling terminal differentiation with microanatomic position . An early feature of squamous neoplasia of all types is disrupted differentiation to variable degrees , typically associated with thickening of the epithelium and increased proliferation . Therefore , although SCCs from different sites demonstrate vary - ing epidemiologic associations — UV radiation in skin cancers , alcohol and tobacco exposure in esophageal cancers , and human papillomavirus infection in cervical and head and neck cancers — they likely share disruption of pathways that coordinate micro - environment - dependent squamous differentiation ( 3 ) . Although emerging targeted therapies show promise in epi - thelial cancers , few recurrent genetic aberrations have been identi ﬁ ed in lung SCCs or cutaneous SCCs ( cSCCs ) ( 4 ) . Acti - vating HRAS mutations are highly prevalent in murine SCC - like malignancies but rare in their human counterparts ( 5 , 6 ) . Fewer than 10 % of head and neck SCCs and cSCCs carry EGFR and PIK3CA gain - of - function mutations ( 7 – 9 ) , and the oncogenic kinase DDR2 is activated in ∼ 5 % of lung SCC primary tumors and cell lines ( 10 ) . In fact , most SCCs lack an identi ﬁ able clas - sical driver mutation , stalling deployment of targeted treatments . Although virtually all SCCs harbor TP53 mutations , additional tumor suppressors have proved elusive . Recent studies have implicated loss of function in NOTCH1 , IRF6 , and TP53 in head and neck SCCs ( 11 , 12 ) . Several models suggest that inactivation of Smad proteins up - regulates TGF signaling , but somatic mu - tations have not been detected in primary cancers ( 13 ) . We recently integrated whole - exome DNA sequence and al - lele - speci ﬁ c copy number data to examine somatically acquired genomic aberrations in eight primary cSCCs ( 14 ) . Given the very high mutation burdens in these cancers , we sought to increase speci ﬁ city for genes with a causative role in tumorigenesis . A search for mutations accompanied by loss of the wild - type allele — a pattern shared by known tumor suppressors in our se - ries , including TP53 and CDKN2A — identi ﬁ ed multiple muta - tions in Notch receptors . Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signal trans - duction pathway that regulates many aspects of development through context - dependent effects on cell fate determination ( 15 , 16 ) , growth ( 17 ) , and survival ( 18 ) . Cognate ligands expressed on the surface of signal - sending cells bind the EGF - like repeats of the Notch ectodomain on signal - receiving cells , initiating a series of proteolytic cleavage events that allow the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) to translocate to the nucleus and form a tran - Author contributions : N .

Although activating mutations in Notch1 occur in the majority of T - cell lymphoblastic leukemia / lym - phoma ( 20 ) and are also often present in poor - prognosis B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( 21 – 23 ) , loss of Notch activity can also produce basal cell carcinoma - like cancers ( 24 ) or squamous cancers ( 25 ) in mice , suggesting that the consequence of speci ﬁ c somatic Notch aberrations in cancer is strongly in ﬂ uenced by epigenetic context . Current models propose that Notch tran - scriptional down - regulation , possibly due to loss of p53 function , is a causative event in human epithelial malignancies ( 26 ) , but disabling somatic aberrations have not been reported in cSCCs or lung SCCs . Here , we describe and functionally characterize frequent Notch loss - of - function mutations in these malignancies . Results Identi ﬁ cation of Notch Mutations . Three additional cSCCs were sequenced on the whole - exome level , in addition to the eight originally reported ( 14 ) . For these 11 samples , ∼ 1 , 300 mutations per genome were identi ﬁ ed ; > 85 % were made up of G > A transitions consistent with UV damage . Nine samples showed at least one NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 mutation , including two sam - ples , cSCCs P8 and P10 , derived from solid organ transplantation patients exposed to long - term immune suppression ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ; ref . 14 ) . Six of these mutations were duplicated trun - cations with loss of the wild - type allele . One additional primary tumor and 14 cSCC cell lines were Sanger sequenced for 30 / 34 exons of NOTCH1 and 30 / 34 exons of NOTCH2 , revealing 15 additional missense mutations and yielding an overall non - synonymous mutation prevalence of NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 , per sample , of 19 / 26 ( ∼ 75 % ) . Thirty - three of 43 total missense or nonsense mutations in Notch genes resulted from a G > A tran - sition . By contrast , exome or transcriptome sequencing of ﬁ ve primary basal cell cancers ( BCCs ) and directed Sanger se - quencing of three BCCs did not identify missense mutations in NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 ( Table S1 ) . No association with clinical subtype or TP53 status was noted ( Table S2 ) . Recent exome - sequencing data from 40 lung SCCs acquired by The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) project were also ex - amined . Three missense mutations and one splice site mutation were identi ﬁ ed in NOTCH1 , as well as one missense and one nonsense mutation in NOTCH2 — a combined mutation fre - quency of 5 / 40 samples or 12 . 5 % ( Table S1 ) . Sanger sequencing for NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in lung SCC cell lines SW900 and HCC95 , esophageal SCC lines TT and TE10 , and lung adeno - carcinoma lines H549 and A549 revealed a single heterozygous nonsense NOTCH1 mutation in TE10 . Analysis of Unique Notch1 Loss - of - Function Mutants . Amino acid ( missense ) changes were analyzed by PolyPhen - 2 ( http : / / genetics . bwh . harvard . edu / pph2 / ) for potential structural effects . Eighteen of 27 mutations were identi ﬁ ed as “ probably damaging ” with the remainder being labeled “ probably benign ” ( Table S3 ) . Be - sides overt loss - of - function frameshift and nonsense mutations , NOTCH1 point mutations involved the extracellular EGF - like repeats , the juxtamembrane heterodimerization domain , and the intracellular RAM domain . To exclude the possibility that the observed changes are nonpathogenic passenger events , we tested the functional consequence of mutations involving each of these domains . An EGF - like repeat mutation ( D469G ) and a unique heterodimerization domain mutation ( R1594Q ) interfered with ligand - mediated activation of Notch1 ( Fig . 2 A ) . D469 , a residue within EGF repeat 12 ( Fig . 2 B ) , contributed to binding of a Ca 2 + ion ( 27 ) , which ﬁ xed the orientation of EGF repeat 11 with re - spect to repeat 12 ( 28 ) . Prior genetic studies have shown that EGF repeats 11 – 12 are necessary and suf ﬁ cient for ligand binding by Drosophila Notch ( 29 ) , and biochemical studies have implicated D469G in binding of recombinant Notch1 EGF repeats 11 – 14 to the human Delta - like - 1 ligand ( 30 ) . P1770S is a mutation in the Notch1 RAM domain , a re - gion that binds the downstream transcription factor RBPJ and 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 N C PEST TAD Ankyrin RAM TM HD C HD N LNR EGF - like N EC N TM ICN Fig . 1 .

Below the domain graph , circles represent mutations in cSCCs , and squares represent mutations in lung SCCs . NOTCH1 driver mutations from hematologic malignancies ( Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database ) are displayed above the exon graph . In these activating changes , missense mutations clustered in the NRR domain , promoting ligand - independent processing , whereas truncations in the C - terminal PEST domain enhanced protein half - life . In contrast , mutations depicted below the graph , from SCCs , appeared in EGF repeats , the juxtamembrane heterodimerization domain , and the intracellular RAM domain . 17762 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1114669108 Wang et al . thereby contributes to the assembly of Notch transcription complexes ( 31 – 33 ) . The P1770S substitution greatly diminished signaling when scored in Δ EGF Δ LNR , a truncated form of Notch1 that signals in a ligand - independent fashion ( Fig . 3 A ) . This mutation also prevented formation of stable ICN1 / RBPJ com - plexes on DNA ( Fig . 3 B ) . Thus , P1770S appears to interfere with Notch signaling at the level of transcription complex assembly . Discussion We describe here a spectrum of inactivating somatic mutations of Notch receptors in lung and skin cancers , indicating that Notch loss of function plays a prominent role in multiple variants of SCC . These aberrations apparently occur signi ﬁ cantly more often in cSCCs than in SCCs arising in the lung and occur in patients with and without a history of immunosuppression . cSCCs accumulate > 100 , 000 nucleotide substitutions as a result of sun damage ( 14 ) , perhaps more frequently inactivating tumor suppressors than their visceral counterparts . Indeed , 85 % of Notch mutations in cSCCs resulted from the G > A transitions induced by UV radiation after homozygous TP53 loss , consistent with evidence for a role in tumor progression rather than initia - tion , possibly through evasion of inhibitory stromal signaling ( 25 ) . Attenuated expression of Notch transcripts is well established in skin cancers ( 26 ) . The high frequency of truncation mutations in our study suggests that some of these instances may represent nonsense - mediated decay . The distribution of missense changes in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 also re ﬂ ects abrogated function . Whereas gain - of - function mutations found in leukemias cluster in the negative regulatory region ( 34 ) and the C - terminal PEST domain ( 20 – 23 ) , the disabling mutations identi ﬁ ed in our study span Notch ectodomains and the N - terminal portion of the in - tracellular domains ( Fig . 1 ) . All of the nonsense mutations lie within or N - terminal of the Notch ankyrin repeats , which are required for all known Notch functions ( 19 ) . Truncations such as Q610 * in Notch1 and W330 * in Notch2 prevent expression of the EGF repeats 11 – 13 required for ligand interaction ( 35 ) ; thus , these mutations probably ablate signaling . Other mutations likely produce either secreted ( e . g . , E1446 * in Notch1 and Q1634 * in Notch2 ) or membrane - teth - ered ( e . g . , Q1924 * in Notch1 and R1838 * in Notch2 ) truncated polypeptides that retain ligand - binding EGF repeats and there - fore have the potential for dominant negative activity ( 36 ) . Similar truncated polypeptides have dominant negative activity in vivo when expressed from transgenes ( 29 ) . Our functional studies suggest that the D469G substitution causes loss - of - function by disrupting the structure of EGF re - peats required for productive Notch1 – ligand engagement . It is less clear how R1594Q , which lies in the activation switch of the receptor , might affect ligand - mediated Notch1 activation . This arginine residue lies in an α - helix within the heterodimeriza - tion domain that packs against the preceding LNR - C module , forming two charged hydrogen bonds to residues D1533 and E1555 ( Fig . 2 C ) . The most likely explanation for the observed loss of function is that the mutation interferes with proper folding of the receptor in a manner that prevents ef ﬁ cient de - livery to the cell surface . Consistent with the folding defect idea , mutations of nearby residues in this α - helix identi ﬁ ed in T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( e . g . , F1592S , L1593P , L1596H , R1598P ) produce gain of function by destabilizing the hetero - dimerization domain , leading to ligand - independent cleavage of Notch1 at site S2 and subsequent receptor activation ( 37 ) .

PNAS | October 25 , 2011 | vol . 108 | no . 43 | 17763 M E D I C A L S C I E N C E S Alternative possibilities , such as stabilization of the autoinhibited conformation of the receptor , seem less likely . The majority of the identi ﬁ ed mutations are heterozygous . Notch proteins demonstrate haploinsuf ﬁ ciency in tissue patterning ( 38 ) , suggesting that loss of a single copy functionally impedes signaling and therefore could plausibly impact tumorigenesis . Speci ﬁ c aberrations , such as the P1770S mutant involving the RAM domain , have the potential to form nonproductive com - plexes with ligands and thereby act in a dominant - negative fashion . Our observation of inactivation of multiple Notch receptors in the same tumor aligns with data from compound knockout mice , in which conditional deletion of multiple Notch genes ( e . g . , NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 ) or of RBPJ , the single downstream mediator of canonical Notch signaling , yields more profound differentiation and barrier function defects than de - letion of any single gene ( 25 , 39 ) . Multiple mutations may act in concert to progressively disable a common downstream set of signaling targets . Alternatively , different Notch receptors might each suppress tumor progression through distinct mechanisms that have yet to be delineated , as the functional interchangeability of individual Notch receptors has not been established . The high prevalence of somatic aberration adds context to noncell autonomous models in which Notch loss is theorized to compromise skin barrier function and promote chronic injury in adjacent cells ( 25 ) . We cannot exclude the possibility that pri - mary cancers arose in ﬁ elds of Notch - disabled cells , analogous to patches of p53 - mutant cells in sun - damaged skin ( 40 ) . However , such ﬁ eld mutations have not yet been described for Notch , and Fig . 3 . Functional characterization of the P1770S mutation . ( A ) Reporter gene assay . U2OS cells lines were cotransfected with a Notch - responsive luciferase reporter plasmid and plasmids encoding a constitutively processed form of the wild - type or P1770S Notch1 receptor .

Puri ﬁ ed RBPJ and puri ﬁ ed polypeptides corresponding to the RAM and ankyrin - repeat ( ANK ) regions of either wild - type or P1770S Notch1 were incubated in the presence of radiolabeled Hes - 1 cognate DNA , as described ( 55 ) .

U2OS cells lines were transfected with a Gal4 - responsive luciferase reporter plasmid and with chimeric receptors that contained the indicated wild - type or mutated Notch1 extracellular domain and an intracellular Notch1 / Gal4 chimera that activates transcription under the control of Gal4 binding sites . Receptors were activated by coculture with 3T3 feeder cells lacking ( − ) or expressing ( + ) the ligand Jagged2 in the absence ( − ) or presence ( + ) of a gamma secretase inhibitor ( GSI ) .

Notably , recurrent mutations were not identi ﬁ ed in genes encoding Notch ligands , RBPJ , or Mastermind - like coactivators , other key components of the canonical Notch signaling pathway . This absence may simply stem from the limited number of tumors analyzed . However , some components of the canonical Notch signaling pathway , particularly RBPJ ( 41 ) and MAMLs ( 42 ) , may execute Notch - independent functions required for effective on - cogenesis . Finally , genetic evidence suggests that noncanonical Notch functions in skin may also contribute to carcinogenesis ( 25 ) . Notch transcription complexes transactivate via multiple mech - anisms , including directly through monomeric and dimeric com - plexes ( as for CD25 and Hes1 ) . The most consequential direct targets of Notch transcription complexes in leukemic cells ap - pear to be Myc ( 43 – 45 ) and Hes1 ( 46 ) , and Notch signaling enhances PI3 - kinase / Akt and mTOR signaling ( 47 , 48 ) . The mechanism of tumor suppression in epithelial cells is less well de ﬁ ned . In mouse skin , Notch tumor suppression has been hy - pothesized to occur downstream of RBPJ - dependent expression of p21 WAF1 / Cip1 , possibly through down - regulation of Wnt proteins ( 49 , 50 ) . However , p21 WAF1 / Cip1 up - regulation is not seen in hu - man skin cancers . Other evidence implicates a distinct pathway involving Hes1 - dependent derepression of ROCK1 / 2 and MRCK - α kinases , which normally activate the RhoA and CDC42 GTPases ( 26 ) . Activation of this pathway ( often via loss of sup - pression ) appears to generate the dedifferentiation and increased motility characteristic of epithelial malignancies . Discriminating among these possibilities awaits sequencing of additional tumors and a more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of tumor suppression in squamous epithelia , which should be aided by the study of Notch - inactivated cSCC cell lines identi ﬁ ed in this report . Gamma - secretase inhibitors now in development to treat he - matologic malignancies associated with oncogenic increases in Notch signaling may induce some characteristics of somatic loss of function in squamous epithelia ( 34 ) . Our results suggest that vigilant screening for epithelial malignancies is warranted upon use of these agents . Materials and Methods SampleAcquisition . Tumorandmatchednormaltissuesampleswereobtained aspartofanestablishedskincancerstudyprotocol , withallsubjectsproviding informed consent according to procedures approved by the University of California , San Francisco Committee on Human Research . Samples were ei - ther immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen or deposited in RNAlater pre - servative ( Qiagen ) . Diagnosis of either cSCC or BCC was con ﬁ rmed for all tumors through histological examination of a standard biopsy specimen by a board - certi ﬁ ed dermatopathologist . Patient information and genomic pro - ﬁ lingforlungSCCsanalyzedherewereobtainedfromsequencingcompletedbyTCGAanddepositedintheDatabaseofGenotypesandPhenotypes . Further details are provided in SI Materials and Methods . Isolation and culture details , as well as detailed characterization of cSCC lines SCCRDEB2 - 4 , SCCT1 - 3 , and - 8 and SCCIC1 , have been described ( 51 ) . Two additional lines sequenced here , SCCIC8 and SCCIC12 , were established from female immunocompetent patients aged 51 and 87 , respectively . The tumor sites were , respectively , buttock ( poorly differentiated spindle cell ) and left calf ( moderately to poorly differentiated SCC ) . Sequencing . For exome sequencing of 11 cSCCs and matching normal tissue , ∼ 40 megabases of coding region were selected from each genomic DNA sample by using oligonucleotide - based hybrid capture and sequenced by using the Illumina sequencing - by - synthesis platform . Three primary BCCs were similarly sequenced on the whole - exome level , and two additional samples were sequenced for transcribed sequences only . Standard methods for alignment , PCR duplicate removal , recalibration of base scores , and mutation calling were applied ( detailed description is provided in SI Mate - rials and Methods ) . Three primary BCCs and 1 additional primary cSCC and matching tissue , as well as 14 cSCC cell lines , were capillary PCR - sequenced ( Sanger ) for NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 mutations . Thirty of 34 exons of NOTCH1 and 30 / 34 exons of NOTCH2 were reliably PCR ampli ﬁ ed . Coverage of coding sequence was assessed by computing sequenced bases per exon with Phred - scaled quality scores , Q , ≥ 20 . For the targeted exons of NOTCH1 , a minimum of 64 % exons met this threshold with a median of 93 % ; for NOTCH2 , a minimum of 83 % of exons met threshold with a median of 96 % . For cSCC cell lines , matching normal lines were not available ; therefore , some variants discovered in these samples are likely germ - line in origin . To minimize inclusion of germ - line variants in the ﬁ nal results , all variants exhibitingoverlapwithmarkersfromthedbSNPbuild131database ( 52 ) were ﬁ ltered out , and three amino acid substitutions also present in other mammalian organisms were excluded . Site - Directed Mutagenesis . QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis was per - formed according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Stratagene ) , and mu - tagenized cDNA sequences were con ﬁ rmed by resequencing . Reporter Gene Assays . Notch1 reporter gene assays were as described ( 37 , 53 ) . Brie ﬂ y , to assess ligand - mediated Notch1 activation , pcDNA3 plasmids en - coding Notch1 – Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion receptors ( 100 ng ) were transfected into U2OS cells along with Gal4 – ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase and human thymidine kinase Renilla luciferase reporter genes . After 24 h , transfected cells were split onto control NIH 3T3 cell feeders or feeders expressing the Notch ligand Jagged2 in the presence or absence of the gamma - secretase inhibitor compound E ( 1 μ M ) . After an additional 24 h , cells were harvested , and dual luciferase assays were carried out . Results were normalized to the internal Renilla luciferase control and expressed relative toempty vectorcontrol , which was arbitrarily set to a value of 1 . To assess effects of mutations on ligand - independent Notch1 activity , U2OS cells were cotransfected with the vector pcDNA3 encoding Δ EGF Δ LNR , a form of Notch1 lacking the EGF and LNR repeats that is subject to constitutive ADAM metalloprotease and gamma - secretase cleavages , along with an arti ﬁ cial RBPJ – ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase and the internal control Renilla luciferase reporter genes , as described ( 54 ) . Normalized luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection as described above . Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays . Recombinant RBPJ and ICN1 poly - peptides were expressed and puri ﬁ ed to homogeneity from Escherichia coli as described ( 55 ) . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as described ( 55 ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Andrew J . Cassidy , Karin J .
