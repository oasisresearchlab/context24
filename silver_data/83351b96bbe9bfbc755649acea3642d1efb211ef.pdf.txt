such as organelle biogenesis , cell division , cell migration , secretion , and endocytosis . In many cases , dynamic membrane remodeling is accomplished by the reversible assembly of membrane - sculpting or deforming proteins , most notably by members of the BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) domain superfamily . Members of this protein superfamily are involved in membrane remodeling in various cellular pathways ranging from endocytic vesicle and T - tubule formation to cell migration and neuromorphogenesis . Membrane curvature induction and stabilization are encoded within the BAR or F - BAR ( Fer - CIP4 homology - BAR ) domains , alpha - helical coiled coils that dimerize into membrane - binding modules . BAR / F - BAR domain proteins often contain also an SH3 domain , which recruits binding partners such as the oligomeric membrane - fissioning GTPase dynamin . How precisely BAR / F - BAR domain - mediated membrane deformation is regulated at the cellular level is unknown . Here we present the crystal structures of full - length syndapin 1 and its F - BAR domain . The crystal structures show that the F - BAR domain of syndapin 1 dimerizes into an elongated “S” shape with a wedge loop in each monomer , which is required for the membrane - deforming activity of syndapin . Importantly , our data also show that syndapin 1 F - BAR - mediated membrane deformation is subject to autoinhibition by its SH3 domain . Release from the clamped conformation is driven by association of syndapin 1 SH3 domain with the proline - rich domain of dynamin 1 , thereby unlocking its potent membrane - bending activity . We hypothesize that this mechanism might be commonly used to regulate BAR / F - BAR domain - induced membrane deformation and to potentially couple this process to dynamin - mediated fission . Our data thus suggest a structure - based model for SH3 - mediated regulation of BAR / F - BAR domain function . Zusammenfassung V Zusammenfassung Eukaryotische Zellen enthalten eine große Vielfalt membranöser Strukturen wie z . B . Vesikel , Röhren und pleiomorphe Vakuolen , die an so unterschiedlichen Prozessen wie der Biogenese zellulärer Organellen , der Zellteilung , Zellmigration , Sekretion und Endozytose beteiligt sind . In den vielen Fällen wird die dynamische Umformung der Membran durch die reversible Zusammenlagerung von Membran - verformenden Proteinen bewirkt , ganz besonders durch Mitglieder der BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) Domänen Proteinfamilie . Mitglieder dieser Proteinfamilie sind beteiligt am Membranumbau im Rahmen verschiedenster zellulärer Prozesse , von der Generierung endozytotischer Vesikel und T - Röhren bis hin zu Zellmigration und Neuromorphogenese . Ihre Fähigkeit zur Induzierung einer bestimmten Membrankrümmung und zur Stabilisierung von gekrümmten Membranen resultiert aus der Struktur ihrer BAR oder F - BAR ( Fer - CIP4 Homologie - BAR ) Domänen . Hierbei handelt es sich um alpha - helikale “coiled coils” , die zu Membran - bindenden Modulen dimerisieren können . BAR / F - BAR Proteine enthalten zudem oft eine SH3 Domäne , die Bindepartner wie die oligomere GTPase Dynamin , die an Membranabtrennungsprozessen beteiligt ist , rekrutieren kann . Wie genau die BAR / F - BAR Domänen vermittelte Membranverformung in der Zelle reguliert wird , ist bislang unbekannt . Die in dieser Doktorarbeit präsentierten Kristall - Strukturdaten von komplettem Syndapin 1 Protein und seiner F - BAR Domäne können zur Aufklärung dieser Frage beitragen . Die Kristallstrukturen zeigen , dass die F - BAR Domäne von Syndapin 1 dimerisiert . Des resultierende Dimer hat die Form eines verlängerten “S” , wobei jedes Monomer eine Keil - artige Schleife enthält , die notwendig ist für die Fähigkeit Syndapins , Membranen zu deformieren . Von großer Bedeutung für das Verständnis der Regulation dieser Fähigkeit ist die aus den Strukturdaten gewonnene Erkenntnis , dass die Syndapin 1 F - BAR - vermittelte Membranverformung durch eine in Syndapin enthaltene SH3 Domäne autoinhibiert wird . Erst wenn diese SH3 Domäne durch die Prolin - reiche Domäne von Dynamin 1 gebunden wird , kommt es zu einer intramolekularen Konformationsänderung in Syndapin , die die Keil - artigen Schleifen freilegt und es ihm so ermöglicht , Membranen zu krümmen . Wir stellen die Hypothese auf , dass diese Art der Autoinhibition ein genereller Mechanismus zur Regulation der BAR / F - BAR Zusammenfassung VI Domänen vermittelten Membrankrümmung sein könnte , der möglicherweise diesen Prozess zugleich an die Dynamin - vermittelte Membranabtrennung koppelt . Unsere Daten schlagen ein Struktur - basiertes Modell für die SH3 - vermittelte Regulation der BAR / F - BAR Domänenfunktion vor . Introduction 1 1 Introduction 1 . 1 Mechanisms of membrane curvature gerenation and membrane deformation Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a diverse array of membraneous structures including vesicles , tubules , Golgi , ER , endosomes , lysosomes , mitochondria and pleiomorphic vacuoles . The bilayer membrane can be considered as a highly regulated and heterogeneous environment which not only functions as an active participant to interact with the outside world but also provides a highly dynamic platform to control its own local morphology by regulating assembly of stabilizing cytoskeletal elements ( Doherty and McMahon , 2008 ) . Cellular activity , such as organelle biogenesis , cell division , cell migration , secretion , exocytosis and endocytosis , depends to a large extent on dynamic membrane bilayer remodelling . Dynamic membrane remodeling is achieved by an intricate interplay between lipids and proteins . The concept of protein - mediated membrane curvature generation in cells has attracted much attention in recent years . McMahon and Gallop suggested five mechanisms that could generate membrane curvature ( Figure1 - 1 ) ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) . Figure 1 - 1 Mechanisms of membrane deformation . Membrane curvature can be generated by five mechanisms . a , changes of lipid composition ; b , influences of integral membrane proteins ; c , cytoskeletal proteins and microtubule motor activity ; d , scaffolding by peripheral membrane Introduction 2 proteins ; e , active insertion of amphipathic helices into the membrane ( Taken from McMahon , HT & Gallop , JL , 2005 ) . 1 . 1 . 1 Changes in lipid composition The chemical properties of different lipid acyl chains or headgroups make them perfer different membrane curvatures . For example , lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid associate with opposite membrane curvatures ( Brown et al . , 2003 ; Kooijman et al . , 2005 ; Shemesh et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure 1 - 1a ) . Addtionally , lipid headgroups are attachment sites for the recruitment of peripheral membrane proteins and can therefore generate membrane curvature . Phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives ( referred to as phosphoinositides , PIs ) have been implicated in numerous membrane trafficking and cellular signalling events . Different phosphoinositide species have been shown to exhibit distinct and characteristic subcellular distribution patterns . For example , the presence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in the plasma membrane is essential for the budding of clathrin - coated vesicles , largely because the budding machinery binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Ford et al . , 2002 ; Ford et al . , 2001 ; Honing et al . , 2005 ; Kinuta et al . , 2002 ; Wenk and De Camilli , 2004 ) . PIs can directly associate with a variety of different proteins including cytoplasmic factors , such as membrane trafficking proteins , cell signalling adaptors , and membrane integral channels and transporters . A variety of structurally different PI binding domains have been identified , including PH ( pleckstrin homology ) , FYVE ( Fab1 , YOTB , Vac1 ( vesicle transport protein ) , and EEA1 domain ) , PX ( Phox homology ) , ENTH ( Epsin N - terminal homology domain ) , ANTH ( AP180 N - terminal homology domain ) , C2 ( protein kinase C conserved region 2 , involved in calcium - dependent phospholipid binding ) , PTB ( Phosphotyrosine binding - domain ) , and FERM domains ( 4 . 1 - ezrin , radixin , and moesin homology domain ) ( Krauss and Haucke , 2007 ) . The recruitment of these binding domains to the membrane can induce local membrane deformation . 1 . 1 . 2 Influence of integral membrane proteins Based on crystal structures of membrane proteins , transmembrane proteins with a conical shape naturally favor curvatures that mould around their shapes . This shape has been illuminated by crystal structures of the voltage - dependent K + - channel ( Mackinnon , 2004 ) , the amino acid antiporter AdiC ( Gao et al . , 2009 ; Gao et al . , 2010b ) , the formate transporter FocA ( Wang et al . , 2009b ) , the transmembrane Introduction 3 domains of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( Fertuck and Salpeter , 1974 ; Unwin , 2005 ) and AMPA - subtype glutamate receptor ( Sobolevsky et al . , 2009 ) . However , given that only a few structures of transmembrane proteins are known , the contribution of their intrinsic shape to membrane curvature remains largely unexplored . 1 . 1 . 3 Cytoskeletal proteins and microtubule motor activity Filamentous cytoskeletal elements associate intimately with the plasma membrane at a wide variety of cellular locations , including highly curved regions of the plasma membrane and sites of adhesion to the cellular surroundings ( Figure 1 - 2 ) . Previous studies have shown that cytoskeletal changes affect membrane remodelling in cell motility and in tubule and vesicle carrier formation ( Allan and Vale , 1994 ; Bretscher , 1996 ; Merrifield , 2004 ) . The cytoskeleton also plays a role in directing the location of fusing and endocytosed vesicles and in localizing receptors and signalling complexes ( Zakharenko and Popov , 1998 ) . The ability of the cytoskeleton to influence membrane - shape changes is affected by membrane tension ( Raucher and Sheetz , 2000 ) , and decreases in tension can induce local curvature . This membrane tension can be generated by two mechanisms : actin polymerization and microtubule motor activity . Actin polymerization has been shown to play a very important role in the remodeling of many areas containing high membrane curvature , including filopodia , lamellipodia , macropinocytic ruffles , adherens junctions , endocytic pits and phagocytic cups ( Figure 1 - 2 ) ( Doherty and McMahon , 2008 ) . During endocytic processes , actin polymerization occurs once the required nucleation initiators , including Arp2 / 3 complex , formins , Cordon - bleu ( Cobl ) , Leiomodin ( Lmod - 2 ) , and Spire proteins are recruited to vesicle buds . The generated actin filaments are thought to push the vesicles off from the plasma membrane ( Figure 1 - 3 ) ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ; Carroll et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ; Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Qualmann and Kessels , 2009 ; Renault et al . , 2008 ; Shupliakov et al . , 2002 ; Takano et al . , 2008 ; Winckler and Schafer , 2007 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . According to the specific architecture of nucleation initiators , they use different manners to catalyze actin polymerization as shown in Figure 1 - 3 . The Arp2 / 3 complex for example , the first actin nucleator to be identified can form a Introduction 4 template for actin nucleation and thereby enable efficient filament formation . This complex is activated by the members of the WASP / WAVE superfamily through their direct interation ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Vartiainen and Machesky , 2004 ) . WASP proteins form a family of five proteins in mammals , Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) , Neural - WASP ( N - WASP ) and Scar / WAVE1 , 2 and 3 ( Suppressor of a cyclic AMP receptor mutation / WASP Verprolin homologous ) ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Vartiainen and Machesky , 2004 ) After activation , Arp2 and Arp3 are arranged to form a complex which mimics an actin dimer . Afterwards , an actin monomer is added onto the Arp2 / 3 complex with the help of WASP proteins . The Arp2 / 3 complex furthermore interacts with the sides of pre - existing actin filaments , which increases its nucleation activity and generates new filament branches at a characteristic 70 o angle ( Figure 1 - 3A ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex thereby gives rise to a rapidly expanding , branched network of filaments ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 ; Qualmann and Kessels , 2009 ) . Actually , many BAR domain containing - proteins have been linked to the nucleation of actin polymerization and are thus able to coordinate actin polymerization and membrane remodeling events ( discussed later ) . Figure 1 - 2 The array of membrane - cytoskeleton interactions in mammalian cells . Schematic Introduction 5 diagram showing the main types of cellular locations where membrane - cytoskeleton interactions are formed ( Taken from Doherty , GJ & McMahon , HT , 2008 ) . Figure 1 - 3 The initiation mechanisms of actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex , formins , Spire , Lmod - 2 and Cobl . ( A ) Domain architecture of the nucleation initiators of Spire , Cobl and Lmod - 2 . A - h , actin - binding helix ; b , basic stretch ; h1 and h2 , helix 1 and 2 ; KIND , kinase non - catalytic C - lobe domain ; NLS , nuclear localization signal ; PRD , proline - rich domain ; Sec , type II secretion / translocation signal ; TM - h1 , tropomyosin - binding helix 1 . ( B ) The Arp2 / 3 complex mimicks an actin dimer after activation by members of the WASP superfamily of proteins ( N - WASP is depicted ) . WASP superfamily proteins interact with G - actin by means of one or two WH2 domain ( s ) and recruit profilin – actin complexes by associating with their proline rich Introduction 6 domain ( PRD ) . ( C ) Formins nucleate using their dimerized doughnut - shaped formin - homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain , to which profilin – actin is recruited by binding to the neighboring proline - rich FH1 domain . During elongation , formins move processively along with the barbed end . ( D ) Lmod - 2 directly binds two actin monomers using its different domains to form an actin dimer ; the third actin is recruited by the WH2 domain of Lmod - 2 and translocated to the actin dimer which initiates actin polymerization . ( E ) For Spire , both the initial model ( Quinlan et al . , 2005 ) ( left side ) and a model ( right side ) based on newer data from Quinlan et al . are shown . The left model : four actin monomers are recruited by Spire using its four WH2 domains ; after that , the monomer actin is added . The right model : Spire directly binds to Formin and forms a Spire 2 - Formin 2 complex ; four actin monomers are recruited by each Spire ( the right side model ) ; the dimerization of Spire - actin 4 - Formin complex allows monomer actin to be added to start actin polymerization . ( F ) In the case of Cobl two actin monomers directly bind to two of its adjacent WH2 domains of Cobl and form an actin dimer ; the third actin is recruited by the third WH2 domain and is translocated to the actin dimer which initiates actin polymerization . ‘ + ’ indicates filament plus ends whereas ‘ _ ’ indicates filament minus ends ( modified from ( Qualmann and Kessels , 2009 ) ) . Microtubule motor activity also has been known to play an important role in membrane traffic , not only by transporting vesicles along microtubule tracks , but also by directly deforming membranes ( Farsad and De Camilli , 2003 ) . Many intracellular membrane tubules are generated in this fashion . For example , microtubule motors along a preformed microtubule track can generate a developing membrane tubule in vitro ( Dabora and Sheetz , 1988 ; Robertson and Allan , 2000 ; Roux et al . , 2002 ) . Microtubule - dependent mechanisms , possibly in cooperation with other cytosolic factors ( Dreier and Rapoport , 2000 ) , have also been suggested to play a role in vitro and in vivo for the tubular dynamics of the ER ( Dabora and Sheetz , 1988 ; Klopfenstein et al . , 1998 ; Vale and Hotani , 1988 ; Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) , as well as for Golgi and endosome tubulation events following treatment with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A ( BFA ) ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1991 ) . 1 . 1 . 4 Scaffolding by peripheral membrane proteins Peripheral membrane proteins can participate in membrane deformation in different ways . First , coat proteins such as clathrin , COPI and COPII which are essential components for vesicle formation , can also be considered as exoskeletons that affect membrane bending by polymerizing into curved structures . However , these coat proteins do not directly associate with membranes and are supposed to act in Introduction 7 conjunction with other proteins ( Antonny et al . , 2003 ; Bi et al . , 2002 ; Bi et al . , 2007 ; Hughson , 2010 ; Lee and Goldberg , 2010 ; Low et al . , 2008 ; Nossal , 2001 ; Russell and Stagg , 2009 ) . The crystal structures or structures determined by electron microscopy of COPI , COPII and clathrin show that they share a similar architecture and functional organization ( Fath et al . , 2007 ; Fotin et al . , 2004 ; Lee and Goldberg , 2010 ; Stagg et al . , 2006 ; Stagg et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 1 - 4 ) . The COPII cage composed of the small GTPase Sar1 , the Sec23 / Sec24 complex and the Sec13 / Sec31 complex is built by α - solenoid and β - propeller protein domains . The COPII cage assembly unit , two copies of Sec13 / 31 , has a central α - solenoid dimer capped by two β - propeller domains at each end ( here called the rod structure ) . The rod builds the edge of a cuboctahedron cage , and four other rods converge to form the vertex with no interdigitation of assembly units . The clathrin cage is generated by triskelion assembly units - trimers of clathrin heavy chains that are centered on the vertices of the cage , and the long α - solenoid legs curves towards and interdigitate with neighboring legs as they extend to the adjacent vertices . COP I consists of seven subunits , α - COP , β - COP , β′ - COP , γ - COP , δ - COP , ε - COP and ζ - COP ( Suntio et al . , 1999 ) . The recently reported crystal structure of the αβ′ - COP core of coatomer shows a triskelion conformation in which three copies of a β′ - COP β - propeller domain converge via their axial ends . Each copy comprises two β - propeller domains at one end followed by an extended α - solenoid ( Lee and Goldberg , 2010 ) . The arrangement of αβ′ - COP shares similar features with clathrin which suggests a similar mechanism to form the COP I cage . Figure 1 - 4 The three archetypal vesicle coats . ( A ) COPI , COPII and clathrin drive the formation of transport vesicles by polymerization . ( B ) COPII polymerizes into a polyhedral lattice Introduction 8 with triangular and pentagonal faces . In contrast , COPI is proposed to form clathrin - like truncated icosohedra with hexagonal and pentagonal faces ( modified from ( Hughson , 2010 ) ) . Figure 1 - 5 Domains of the human dynamin superfamily . All dynamins have a GTPase domain , a middle domain and a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) ( except for Atlastin family proteins ) . Most dynamins also have a PH domain for interactions with membranes . Classical dynamins carry a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) at the carboxyl terminus that binds Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domains . Human dynamin - superfamily members are grouped according to their domain structure and their accession numbers are shown . DLP1 , dynamin - like protein1 ; GBP1 , guanylate - binding protein 1 ; OPA1 , optic atrophy 1 ( taken from ( Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) ) . Second , proteins of the dynamin family interact with lipid membranes via their PH domain and form helical oligomers which constrain the membrane topology into a tubular shape ( Gao et al . , 2010a ; Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . All dynamins contain a GTPase domain that binds and hydrolyses GTP , a middle domain and a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) that are involved in oligomerization and stimulation of GTPase activity ( Figure 1 - 5 ) ( Ramachandran et al . , 2007 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) . Additionally , most dynamins carry a PH domain for interactions with lipid membranes . Classical dynamins contain a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) at the carboxyl terminus which recruits dynamin for vecsicle formation by interacting with Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domains . Based on electron microscopy , dynamin tubulates liposomes and forms T - bar - like structures in which the PH domain is at the base of the T - bar ( Figure 1 - 6A ) ( Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) . Although the crystal structure of full - length dynamin 1 is still unknown , crystal structures of isolated domains ( except its PRD domain which forms a flexible Introduction 9 loop structure ) have been determined . By combining this data with electron microscopy , a dynamin model has been recently deduced by Gao S et al ( Figure 1 - 6 ) ( Gao et al . , 2010a ) , which provides details for understanding dynamin’s biological function . Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that the GTPase dynamin functions as a mechanochemical enzyme , which plays an essential role in endocytosis by catalyzing the fission of nascent clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane . Its hydrolysis of GTP provides the energy to generate a large conformational change within dynamin which helps clathrin - coated vesicles to be pinched off from the plasma membrane ( Marks et al . , 2001 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) . Recent studies suggest that dynamin is recruited for vesicle formation by BAR domain containing - proteins , such as endophilin , amphiphysin , sorting nexin 9 and syndapin , particularly for assembling around necks of clathrin - coated pits ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Habermann , 2004 ; Ren et al . , 2006 ) . The biological function of dynamin together with BAR domain containing - proteins will be dicussed later in this study . Figure 1 - 6 Model of a dynamin oligomer . ( A ) The typical T - bar shape of dynamin is shown by Introduction 10 an EM electron density map . The locallization of differents domains are coloured ( taken from ( Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) ) . ( B ) The crystal structure model of dynamin is shown . PH domain , stalks region and G domain are indicated . ( C ) Two views of a complete turn of the dynamin helix composed of 13 – 14 dimers according to the EM electron density map of oligomerized dynamin in the constricted state . Only after one complete turn is formed the G domains of neighbouring helical turns ( shown in green – red and yellow – blue surface representations ) can approach each other ( modified from ( Gao et al . , 2010a ) ) . Figure 1 - 7 The organization of lipid rafts and caveolae membranes . ( A ) Lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol within the liquid - ordered phase ( yellow ) and exoplasmically oriented sphingolipids ( pink ) in the outer leaflet . In contrast , the liquid - disordered phase is composed essentially of phospholipids ( shown in green ) . ( B ) The caveolae structure is generated within lipid rafts . Upon integration of the caveolin - 1 protein , liquid - ordered domains form small flask - shaped invaginations called caveolae . Caveolin - 1 monomers assemble into discrete homo - oligomers ( shown as dimers for simplicity ) containing 14 to 16 individual caveolin molecules ( taken from ( Razani et al . , 2002 ) ) . Third , membrane bending is generated by caveolae structures . These flask - shaped membrane invaginations were first identified by electron microscopy ( Palade , 1953 ) . Caveolae form a stable functional unit at the cell surface and are generated by oligomerized caveolin and associated proteins and lipids ( Figure 1 - 7 ) ( Parton and Simons , 2007 ; Razani and Lisanti , 2001 ) . The caveolin gene family has three members in vertebrates : caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 , and caveolin - 3 . Unlike COP and clathrin - coated vesicles , caveolins are a family of integral membrane proteins which Introduction 11 are the principal components of caveolae membranes and possibly involved in receptor - independent endocytosis ( Scherer et al . , 1996 ; Tang et al . , 1996 ; Williams and Lisanti , 2004 ) . Lastly , BAR domains are modules that sense and generate membrane curvature as part of both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathway ( BAR domains will be discussed later ) . 1 . 1 . 5 Helix insertion into membranes Amphipathic helices are stretches of α - helix with a charged ( polar ) side and a hydrophobic side . The most important feature of an amphipathic helix is its effect on membrane curvature . In many cases the α - helix forms only when the protein is tightly associated with the membrane . The helices are predicted to sit flat on the membrane surface with the hydrophobic residues dipping into the hydrophobic phase of the membrane ( Campelo et al . , 2008 ; Ford et al . , 2002 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . This asymmetric insertion into one leaflet of the membrane results in membrane bending . Amphipathic helices are found in trafficking proteins as diverse as small G proteins ( like Arf and Sar1 ( Bi et al . , 2002 ; Bielli et al . , 2005 ; Huang et al . , 2001 ; Liu et al . , ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Memon , 2004 ; Rao et al . , 2006 ) ) , epsins , BAR domains as well as others ( Cui et al . , 2009 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Low et al . , 2008 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . For example , folding of the ‘ 0 - helix ’ ( according to crystal structure of ENTH domain , 0 - helix stands for the flexible loop at N - terminus . ) is induced upon the interaction between the ENTH domain of epsin and a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched membrane surface ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) . The newly formed helix is amphipathic in nature . Positively charged residues on one side of the helix are engaged in lipid headgroup binding , whereas hydrophobic residues on the other face insert into the cytoplasmic face of the lipid bilayer . Actually , amphipathic α - helices not only induce membrane curvature , but are also believed to act as sensors of membrane curvature , thus facilitating the assembly of protein complexes on curved membranes . ( Bhatia et al . , 2010 ; Bhatia et al . , 2009 ; Drin and Antonny , 2010 ; Epand et al . , 1995 ) 1 . 2 BAR domains In most cases , dynamic membrane remodelling is accomplished by the reversible assembly of membrane - sculpting or deforming proteins ( Hatzakis et al . , 2009 ; Hui et Introduction 12 al . , 2009 ) . Recently , increasing numbers of membrane - deforming proteins connecting the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane have been indentified . These proteins contain a BAR , or EFC / F - BAR and or IMD / I - BAR domain ( Figure 1 - 8 ) . The BAR ( B in , a mphiphysin , R vs ) domain was originally identified as an evolutionary conserved region shared by the yeast proteins Rvs161 , Rvs167 and the metazoans amphiphysins ( the splice variants of which are also called Bin1 ) ( David et al . , 1996 ; Lichte et al . , 1992 ; Sakamuro et al . , 1996 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ) It was predicted to have a coiled - coil domain structure and was shown to act as homo - and heterodimerization domain ( Ramjaun et al . , 1999 ; Slepnev et al . , 1998 ; Wigge et al . , 1997 ) . The first crystal structure of the Arfaptin elucidated how these domains are able to generate finely organized membrane microstructures ( Tarricone et al . , 2001 ) . BAR domains are dimerized via α - helical coiled coils and the dimerization module forms a positively charged surface that associates with the negatively charged inner surface of the plasma membrane , mostly through interaction with negatively charged phospholipids ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Tarricone et al . , 2001 ) . BAR domain superfamily proteins deform membranes to a geometry that corresponds to the structures of the membrane - binding surface of the protein ( a crescent - shaped dimer or / banana - shaped dimer ) ( Figure 1 - 9 ) . Figure 1 - 8 Schematic diagram of the domain structures of BAR - , EFC / F - BAR - and IMD / I - BAR - domain - containing proteins . Besides BAR domain , EFC / F - BAR and IMD / I - BAR domains , other domains are indicated for each protein ( Taken from Suetsugu , S . , 2010 ) . Introduction 13 In vitro , liposome tubulation assay has been generally used to study the membrane tubulation activity of BAR domain . Pervious studies have shown that BAR domain containing - proteins , such as amphiphysin , endophilin , FBP17 and CIP4 , are able to bind lipids and to induce tubulation of liposomes ( Figure 1 - 10 , Figure 1 - 11A - D ) ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) . A recent cryo - EM analysis of a CIP4 F - BAR domain illustrated how BAR domain can associate with membranes to form cylindrical tubules ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 1 - 10 ) . To form membrane tubule structure , F - BAR domain is self - assembled / oligomerized into a helical coat . Besides the tip - to - tip interactions , the broad contacts between laterally - adjacent dimmers are also required for the oligomerization of F - BAR domain ( Figure 1 - 10C , D ) . By fitting crystal structure of CIP4 F - BAR domain into cryo - EM reconstructions of membrane tubules , a cluster of positive residues ( R / K ) on the concave surface of the F - BAR module are necessary to bind the membrane bilayer and enable rigid F - BAR dimers to deform membrane ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) . In vivo , overexpression of BAR / F - BAR domain or BAR / F - BAR domain containing proteins also generates membrane tubules in cells ( Figure 1 - 11E - G ) , but BAR domain and F - BAR domain proteins segregate within distinct areas within the tubules ( Figure 1 - 11H ) ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) .

Introduction 15 Figure 1 - 11 Membrane tubulation by BAR / F - BAR domains . Tubules were generated when liposomes were incubated with purified amphiphysin 1 ( A ) , endophilin 1 ( B ) , FBP17 ( C ) or CIP4 ( D ) . ( E , F ) Numerous membrane tubules in Cos7 cells were generated from the plasma membrane by the expression of endophilin3 - GFP ( E ) and GFP - FBP17 ( F ) .

Bars , 500 nm ( A ) , 100 nm ( B – D ) , 10 μ m ( E , F and H ) and 1 μ m ( inset in H ) ( Taken from ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) ) . A common feature of endocytosis - linked BAR proteins is the presence of a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( Figure1 - 8 ) , which is able to interact with dynamin , synaptojanin and members of the WASP family of proteins that regulate actin polymerization ( Ayton et al . , 2009 ; Casal et al . , 2006 ; Cui et al . , 2009 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Frost et al . , 2009 ; Habermann , 2004 ; Low et al . , 2008 ; Masuda and Mochizuki , 2010 ; Ren et al . , 2006 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2009 ; Takano et al . , 2008 ) . The multidomain scaffold protein amphiphysin , for instance is a recently identified example of a BAR protein that couples to endocytic and actin - regulatory proteins , including dynamin and N - WASP ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . Based on their different curvature preferences , the BAR superfamily can be subdivided into BAR / N - BAR ( N - BAR : a BAR domain with an N - terminal amphipathic helix ) modules that bind to membranes of high positive curvature , EFC / F - BAR domain modules that bind to a different range of positive curvature membranes , and I - BAR modules ( “I” - Inverting fitting to different membrane Introduction 16 curvature ) that bind to negatively curved membranes . 1 . 2 . 1 BAR / N - BAR BAR / N - BAR domains are diverse in sequence and organization . However , they have in common that they are usually present at sites of dynamic membrane remodeling . BAR domains are frequently found in conjunction with a second membrane binding sequence such as an amphipathic α - helix , a PH domain , or a PX domain . The PH domain mainly binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 or PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ( Wang and Shaw , 1995 ) . PX domains can interact with various phosphoinositides , most notably PtdIns ( 3 ) P ( Ago et al . , 2003 ; Karathanassis et al . , 2002 ) . BAR domains exhibit relatively non - specific binding to negatively charged phospholipid membranes , but a neighboring PH or PX domain can confer specificity ( Figure 1 - 8 ) ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . The PH or PX domains could thus assist BAR domain - containing proteins to target to a specific membrane compartment , where they could induce local membrane deformation . BAR domain containing - proteins frequently contain an N - terminal amphipathic helix ( referred to as AH ) preceding the consensus BAR domain ; this combination is referred to as an N - BAR domain . As discussed before , amphipathic helices are often unstructured until they insert into lipid membranes . The amphiphatic helices together with BAR domains emerge as an important means for proteins to sense membrane curvature and to participate in membrane insertion and bending . Thus , N - BAR domain containing - proteins not only can induce membrane curvature using their N - terminal amphipathic helices but also stabilize the curved membrane by the banana - like shape of the BAR domain , suggesting a dual role for BAR domain proteins in regulating membrane curvature . Well - studied examples of N - BAR proteins are the endophilin and amphiphysin families which are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling ( Dickman et al . , 2005 ; Jao et al . , 2010 ; Mizuno et al . , 2010 ) . Endophilin and amphiphysin interact with dynamin , N - WASP and synaptojanin through their SH3 domain . Amphiphysin can also bind to clathrin and the AP2 adaptor complex ( David et al . , 1996 ; Ramjaun and McPherson , 1998 ; Slepnev et al . , 2000 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the crystal structure of endophilin N - BAR reveals the presence of an additional insert helix within the BAR domain , which is conserved between endophilin proteins ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Jao et al . , 2010 ; Masuda Introduction 17 et al . , 2006 ) . This additional structure is an amphipathic helix located in the centre of the banana shape of the domain . Recent studies show that this extra amphipathic helix inserts into the lipid bilayer in a similar way as N - terminal amphipathic helices to induce membrane curvature ( Cui et al . , 2009 ; Jao et al . , 2010 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ) . N - BAR domains can thus impose a positive feedback loop on themselves by bending membranes and still associates with the bent membrane surface . . The extra amphipathic helix in endophilin could confer faster tubulation or increase the time that endophilin remains associated with the membrane compared with amphiphysin , reflecting differences in the functions of these proteins ( Cui et al . , 2009 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . This may also explain why different BAR domains are acting at different stages of vesicle formation . BAR domain proteins with adjacent PH / PX domains tabulate liposome less efficiently compared with BAR domains having an amphipathic helix and the interaction between the BAR - PH domain and liposomes is sensitive to membrane curvature ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . However , PH and PX domains bind to specific phosphoinositides which will increase the specificity of membrane targeting of BAR domain proteins . For example , the BAR and PX domains of SNX1 ( Sorting Nexin ) have been shown to target SNX1 to a highly curved microdomain in early endosomes that contains PtdIns ( 3 ) P and to mediate tubulation of early endosomes ( Carlton et al . , 2004 ) . Sorting nexins are a large family of proteins grouped according to the presence of a SNX – PX phosphoinositide - binding domain and are largely involved in regulating vesicle trafficking between intracellular compartments ( Carlton et al . , 2004 ; Carlton et al . , 2005 ) . 1 . 2 . 2 F - BAR ( EFC ) domain F - BAR proteins were formerly referred to as Pombe Cdc15 homology ( PCH ) proteins . Owing to primary sequence similarity , a domain with a distant relation to BAR domains was indentified within them ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . The archetypal feature of this protein family is their Fer / CIP4 homology ( FCH ) domain , which constitutes a functional unit with a neighboring coiled - coil region , together forming the F - BAR domain . F - BAR domain - containing proteins often contain various combinations of SH3 domains , SH2 domains , tyrosine kinase domains and RhoGAP domains at their C - terminal part ( Figure1 - 8 ) . The mammalian F - BAR proteins have been grouped into Introduction 18 several subfamilies : FES / FER tyrosine kinases , the CIP4 subfamily , the srGAP subfamily , the PSTPIP subfamily , the FCH domain - only ( FCHO ) subfamily and the Syndapin / Pacsin subfamily ( which will be discussed in detail in section 1 . 4 ) ( Figure 1 - 12 ) ( Fricke et al . , 2010 ; Heath and Insall , 2008 ) . The Fes / Fer proteins , consisting of an amino - terminal F - BAR domain , a central SH2 domain and a carboxy - terminal kinase domain , are a distinct family of non - receptor tyrosine kinases with prominent roles in regulating cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganisation through the modification of adherens junctions ( Greer , 2002 ; Murray et al . , 2006 ) . Fer localizes to microtubule ends and is involved in phosphorylation of adhesion molecule platelet / endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 ( Kogata et al . , 2003 ; Udell et al . , 2006 ) . Fer has also been linked to actin dynamics through the interaction with cortactin ( Fan et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the interaction between Fer and p120 catenin is required for normal neuronal polarization and neurite development ( Lee , 2005 ) . Figure 1 - 12 The subfamily of F - BAR domain containing - proteins . F - BAR domain containing - proteins are divided into six groups : FES / FER tyrosine kinases , the CIP4 subfamily , the srGAP subfamily , the PSTPIP subfamily , the FCH domain - only ( FCHO ) subfamily and the Syndapin / Pacsin subfamily ( modified from ( Heath and Insall , 2008 ) ) . The CIP4 subfamily contains Cdc42 - interacting protein - 4 ( CIP4 ) , formin - binding protein - 17 ( FBP - 17 ) and transactivator of cytoskeletal assembly - 1 ( Toca - 1 ) . These proteins are composed of an F - BAR domain at the N - terminus , an HR1 domain Introduction 19 ( Cdc42 binding site ) in the middle and a C - terminal SH3 domain . They form a complex with WASP and SCAR / WAVE using their SH3 domain to promote membrane invagination . FBP17 and CIP4 bind to dynamin via their SH3 domain which antagonizes their tubulation activity ( Bu et al . , 2009 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ; Feng et al . , 2010 ; Fricke et al . , 2009 ; Hartig et al . , 2009 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Insall and Machesky , 2004 ; Leung et al . , 2008 ; Suetsugu , 2009 ; Tsuboi et al . , 2009 ) . Accumulating evidence suggests that the CIP family proteins coordinate the membrane - cytoskeleton events associated with endocytosis . The srGAP subfamily consists of the three isoforms srGAP1 - 3 ( S lit - Robo R ho G TPase a ctivating p rotein ) which contain an EFC / F - BAR domain , a GAP domain for small GTPases and an SH3 domain ( Guerrier et al . , 2009 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Wong et al . , 2001 ) . Like in the case of CIP family proteins , the SH3 domain of srGAP often binds to WASP / WAVE proteins . All srGAP proteins are linked to a signal transduction pathway from extracellular guidance cues to intracellular actin polymerization . The activity of Cdc42 is negatively regulated by srGAP1 , which plays an important role in neuronal migration ( Wong et al . , 2001 ) . srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F - BAR domain to induce filopodia - like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I - BAR domains in vivo and in vitro ( Guerrier et al . , 2009 ) . However , the mechanism by which srGAP F - BAR is able to induce filopodia - like membrane protrusions still needs to be investigated . srGAP3 binds directly to WAVE - 1 through its SH3 domain and specifically inhibits Rac function in vivo ( Soderling et al . , 2002 ) . RhoGAP4 ( also called ARHGAP4 ) has the same architecture as srGAP : an F - BAR domain at the N - terminus , a central GTPase activating ( GAP ) domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Demura et al . , 2002 ) . The F - BAR domain is important for spatially localizing RhoGAP4 to the leading edges of migrating NIH / 3T3 cells and to axon growth cones , whereas GAP domain and C - terminus are necessary for ARHGAP4 - mediated inhibition of cell and axon motility ( Vogt et al . , 2007 ) . The protein Nervous Wreck ( Nwk 1 and Nwk2 ) also belongs to the srGAP subfamily . Nwk1 / 2 is a conserved neuronal F - BAR / SH3 protein that localizes to periactive zones at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) and is required for regulation of synaptic growth via bone morphogenic protein signaling ( Collins and DiAntonio , 2004 ; Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . Introduction 20 Nwk interacts functionally and physically with the endocytic proteins dynamin and Dap160 / intersectin and functions together with Cdc42 to promote WASP - mediated actin polymerization and to regulate synaptic growth ( O ' Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ; Rodal et al . , 2008 ) . PSTPIP 1 and PSTPIP 2 ( p roline - s erine t hreonine p hosphatase - i nteracting p roteins 1 and 2 ) contain an F - BAR domain and an SH3 domain . PSTPIP1 interacts with WASP via its SH3 domain , which implies that PSTPIP proteins are linked to actin dynamics . The interaction is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the PSTPIP SH3 domain ( Cote et al . , 2002 ; Spencer et al . , 1997 ; Wu et al . , 1998a ; Wu et al . , 1998b ) . PSTPIP has been linked to filopodia formation through its putative F - actin bundling activity ( Chitu et al . , 2005 ; Spencer et al . , 1997 ) . However , the role of its F - BAR domain in filopodia formation is still unknown . The FCH domain - only ( FCHO ) subfamily consists of two isoforms , FCHO1 and FCHO2 ( homologous to the yeast protein Syp1 ) . They contain an F - BAR domain and a μ HD domain with a Proline - rich region in between ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . Previous studies have shown that Syp1 is recruited early to sites of actin - dependent endocytosis ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) , inhibits Las17 / WASP dependent activation of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly , and localizes to cortical sites of endocytosis ( Boettner et al . , 2009 ) . More recently , the crystal structures of the F - BAR domain of Syp1 and FCHO2 have been solved . Similar to other BAR domains , they dimerize into a crescent - shape conformation ( Henne et al . , 2007 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ) . The FCHO1 / 2 F - BAR membrane - bending activity was suggested to sculpt the initial vesicle bud site and to recruit the clathrin machinery for CCV formation with the help of the endocytic proteins eps15 and intersectin ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Gas7 ( growth arrest - specific gene 7 ) , another member of the FCHO family , is predominantly expressed in neurons and required for the maturation of primary cultured neurons as well as for neuron - like differentiation of PC12 cells upon nerve growth factor stimulation ( Chao et al . , 2003 ; Ebinger et al . , 2006 ; Lazakovitch et al . , 1999 ; She et al . , 2002 ) . Gas 7 also physically interacts with N - WASP and regulates the neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons ( You and Lin - Chao , 2010 ) . The F - BAR domain containing - proteins have many properties which are similar to BAR proteins . They can dimerize and bind to the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine Introduction 21 in a manner that is enhanced by the presence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . F - BAR proteins ( e . g . FBP - 17 or CIP4 ) can tubulate membranes and form higher - order oligomers ( Figure 1 - 11D , F , H ) ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . However , the tubules produced by F - BAR domain have clearly distinct characteristics . They are larger and appear less flexible than tubules produced by BAR domains ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , when co - expressed in cells , BAR and F - BAR domains produce an interconnected system of tubules , but segregate to distinct parts of the tubules ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . Like other BAR domain containing proteins , most F - BAR domain containing - proteins also have an SH3 domain at their C - terminus , which interacts with dynamin , synaptojanin and N - WASP ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) , implying that these proteins are involved in vesicle recycling and endocytosis . 1 . 2 . 3 I - BAR domain The I - BAR domain ( inverse BAR ) was first identified in IRSp53 based on sequence homology as an F - actin crosslinking domain at the N - terminal region of mammalian IRSp53 and MIM ( missing - in - metastasis ) proteins ( Habermann , 2004 ; Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ) . The IRSp53 protein family comprises IRTKS ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ; also known as BAIAP2L1 ) , MIM / ABBA ( missing in metastasis / actin - bundling protein with BAIAP2 homology ) , and FLJ22582 ( BAIAP2L2 ) ( Ahmed et al . , 2010 ) . Crystal structure analysis of the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 shows strong structural similarity to the BAR domain family . One monomer consists of three α helices that dimerize into an antiparallel structure which resembles a distinct , rather flat , cigar shaped curvature ( Figure 1 - 9 ) ( Millard et al . , 2005 ) and the positively charged lipid - binding surface of I - BAR domains displays a convex geometry ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006b ) . Like BAR / F - BAR domains , the I - BAR domains of MIM and IRSp53 also can directly bind and deform membranes into tubules in vitro ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006b ) . However , I - BAR modules stabilize tubules that penetrate into liposomes when bound to the membrane ( Figure 1 - 13 ) ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . Strikingly , different I - BAR domains deform PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - rich membranes through distinct mechanisms . The I - BAR domains of IRSp53 and IRTKS bind membranes mainly through electrostatic interactions , whereas I - BAR domains of Introduction 22 MIM and ABBA insert an additional amphipathic helix into the membrane bilayer , resulting in a larger tubule diameter in vitro and more efficient filopodia formation in vivo ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Figure 1 - 13 3D electron tomography analysis of I - BAR domain induced tubular network . Membrane tubules generated by MIM I - BAR ( diameter of 78 nm ) penetrate liposome . Bar , 0 . 1 μ m ( taken from ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) ) . Figure 1 - 14 Actin filament formation via the SH3 domain binding partners of IRSp53 . ( A ) Dimmerization of IRSp53 results in an autoinhibitory conformation , called inactive IRSp53 . ( B ) Cdc42 binding to IRSp53 releases it from its autoinhibitory conformation and recruits it to the plasma membrane . There , the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 induces negative membrane curvature and its SH3 domain recruits mDia1 and Mena to acitivate the formation of actin filaments , but not N - WASP or WAVE2 . ( C ) Replacement of mDia1 by Eps8 blocks one side for the formation of actin filaments , but the other one is still available . ( D ) Interaction between actin and Eps8 blocks Introduction 23 the further addition of actin at the barbed ends of actin filaments ( modified from ( Ahmed et al . , 2010 ) ) . A prominent feature of I - BAR domains is their ability to induce filopodia formation . A possible mechanism underlying this ability was proposed by Ahmed et al in the convergent elongation model for filopodia formation ( Ahmed et al . , 2010 ) . Figure 1 - 14 illustrates this model using IRSp53 as an example . This protein has an autoinhibitory comformation in its “inactive” state ( Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) . The interaction of IRSp53 with the GTP - bound state of the small GTPases Rac or Cdc42 releases IRSp53 from its autoinhibitory conformation and recruits it to the plasma membrane ( Figure 1 - 14A ) ; There , the IPSp53 I - BAR domain induces membrane deformation while the available SH3 domain recruits its specific binding partners mDia ( a downstream effector of the small GTPase Rho implicated in stress fiber formation and cytokinesis ( Fujiwara et al . , 2000 ) ) and Mena ( Abou - Kheir et al . , 2008 ; Disanza et al . , 2006 ; Funato et al . , 2004 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2003 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006a ) . The recruitment of Mena initiates actin filament assembly into filopodia ( Figure 1 - 14B ) . The selective interactions with mDia and Mena block the barbed ends of selected Arp2 / 3 - nucleated lamellipodial microfilaments from capping proteins . Eps8 , an actin - binding and regulatory protein , has barded - end capping activity which is mainly regulated by an amphiphathic helix that binds the hydrophobic pocket at the barbed ends of actin filaments , thus blocking the further addition of actin monomers ( Figure 1 - 14C , D ) ( Disanza et al . , 2004 ; Higgs , 2004 ) . The replacement of mDia1 by Eps8 blocks one side ( called “blocked site” ) for the formation of actin filaments , while the other one is still available . Interchange of Eps8 and Mena at the barbed ends of actin filaments initiates the formation of actin filaments at the previously blocked site . Recent studies show that Cdc42 binding of IRSp53 regulates the cellular distribution of the IRSp53 - Eps8 complex and that the removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8 inhibits Cdc42 - induced filopodia formation . These data imply that the synergistic bundling activity of the IRSp53 - Eps8 complex regulated by Cdc42 contributes to the generation of actin bundles and thus promotes filopodial protrusions ( Disanza et al . , 2006 ; Funato et al . , 2004 ) . Introduction 24 1 . 3 Membrane deformation in the endocytic pathway The endocytic pathway is essential for the delivery of membrane components , receptor - bound ligands , and soluble molecules to different intracellular organelles . Mammalian cells have at least five endocytic pathways : clathrin - dependent endocytosis , caveolae - dependent endocytosis , clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis , macropinocytosis and phagocytosis ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ; Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) . In central nervous system synapses , multiple synaptic vesicle retrieval pathways are necessary for the recycling of synaptic vesicle ( SV ) membrane after exocytosis to maintain synaptic transmission ( Figure 1 - 15 ) . These pathways are a still somewhat controversial “Kiss and Run” mechanism , bulk endocytosis and clathrin - memdiated endocytosis . In the “kiss and run” model , synaptic vesicles are believed to form transient fusion pores in the presynaptic membrane , thereby releasing only part of their contents . Then they are immediately retrieved by a clathrin - independent process without ever fully collapsing into the plasma membrane ( Burgoyne et al . , 2001 ; Fesce et al . , 1994 ; Hanna et al . , 2009 ; Palfrey and Artalejo , 2003 ; Rizzoli and Jahn , 2007 ; Schneider , 2001 ; Tsuboi and Rutter , 2003 ) . Bulk endocytosis is activated by strong stimulation and leads to the invagination of a large area in the presynaptic membrane , thereby forming “endosome - like structures” . These endosome - like structures can remain attached to the plasma membrane for a considerable length of time while synaptic vesicles constantly bud ( Clayton et al . , 2009 ; Clayton and Cousin , 2009a ; Clayton and Cousin , 2009b ; Clayton et al . , 2007 ; Clayton et al . , 2008 ; Cousin , 2009 ) . Figure 1 - 15 Synaptic vesicle retrieval pathways in central nerve terminals . Three different Introduction 25 mechanisms are suggested to retrieve synaptic vesicle ( SV ) membrane after exocytosis in nerve terminals . In the “Kiss - and - run” mechanism , SVs never fully fuse with the plasma membrane and are retrieved intact . In the classical clathrin - dependent endocytosis a clathrin - coated bud invaginates from the plasma membrane before its fission and uncoating . Bulk endocytosis refers to the process that large areas of nerve terminal membrane are invaginated to produce endosomes - like structures from which SVs can bud ( updated from ( Clayton et al . , 2007 ) ) . Figure 1 - 16 Membrane curvature modulation during endocytosis . ( A ) Schematic diagram illustrating the stages of clathrin mediated endocytosis and some of the key protein players in the budding and scission of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) . After budding to form a clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) , the clathrin basket is removed by uncoating proteins yielding a naked vesicle . Different mechanisms of membrane curvature generation and stabilization are illustrated in B , C and D ( modified from ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) ) . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis is the major pathway for the uptake of nutrients and signaling molecules in higher eukaryotic cells and important for the recycling or degradation of transmembrane receptors . According to the classical model , clathrin - mediated endocytosis results in the reformation of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic membrane to allow to reuse of synaptic vesicle components ( Brodin et al . , 2000 ; Granseth et al . , 2007 ; Jung and Haucke , 2007 ; Sato et al . , 2009 ; Teng and Wilkinson , 2000 ) . A clathrin coat is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane , which then invaginates into a coated pit . The developing clathrin - coated pits constrict at the neck and finally pinches off from the membrane ( Figure 1 - 16 ) . The newly formed vesicles are moved into the cytoplasm where they are uncoated Introduction 26 and can undergo further sorting . The proper formation and fission of clathrin - coated pits from the plasma membrane requires the large GTPase dynamin and many scaffolding and accessory proteins , such as the adapter proteins AP2 , DAB2 / ARH , β - arrestin , Epsin , intersectin , eps15 as well as BAR domain containing - proteins ( see also in Section 1 . 3 . 2 ) . Most of these scaffolding and accessory proteins have membrane binding regions or membrane deformation elements which are necessary for vesicle formation and fission ( Figure 1 - 16 ) . To describe the mechanism of clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) formation at the plasma membrane , the process can be subdivided into three stages : ( 1 ) vesicle budding , ( 2 ) vesicle formation ( 4 ) vesicle fission . 1 . 3 . 1 Vesicle budding When a nascent vesicle buds , the membrane must deform . But how do changes in the membrane bilayer generate curvature during bud formation ? Recent studies show that FCHO1 / 2 proteins bind specifically to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched membranes and sculpt the initial vesicle bud site by their F - BAR membrane - bending activity . FCHO1 / 2 via their μ HD domains associate with the scaffold proteins eps15 and intersectin , which in turn engage the adaptor complex AP2 and clathrin ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Eps15 contains several functional protein domains : three EH domains which recognize Asn - Pro - Phe peptides ( NPF motifs ) ( Diril et al . , 2006 ; Maritzen et al . , 2010 ; McPherson et al . , 1998 ; Rumpf et al . , 2008 ; van Bergen En Henegouwen , 2009 ) , a coiled - coil region ( which serves as the interacting surface for the constitutive oligomerization of Eps15 and can additionally interact with other proteins ( Tebar et al . , 1997 ) ) , a DPF repeat domain ( needed for the association with AP2 ) ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ) , and two consecutive UIMs ( ubiquitin - interaction motifs which bind to ubiquitin - modified proteins ) ( Figure 1 - 17 ) ( Fallon et al . , 2006 ; Klapisz et al . , 2002 ; Regan - Klapisz et al . , 2005 ) . Intersectin contains two Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains , a central coiled - coil region , and five SH3 domains ( Figure 1 - 17 ) ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) . Its long splicing variant also contains a Dbl homology domain ( DH domain ) which catalyzes nucleotide exchange for Rho family GTPases ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) ) , a PH domain , and a C2 domain ( Figure 1 - 17 ) ( Guipponi et al . , 1998 ) . Similar to Eps15 , the EH domain of Introduction 27 intersectin recognizes NPF motif . The central coiled - coil region of intersectin is used for its oligomeriztion and possibly complex formation with Eps15 . The C - terminal five SH3 domains of intersectin recognize proline - rich motifs , such as the ones present in dynamin 1 ( Evergren et al . , 2007 ; Pechstein et al . , 2010b ) . More recent studies show that intersectin binds to AP2 alpha - and beta - appendage domains ( AP2 complex is described later ) using the SH3A - B linker region and that this interaction inhibits binding of the inositol phosphatase synaptojanin 1 to intersectin 1 , suggesting that the intersectin - AP2 complex acts as an important regulator of clathrin - mediated SV recycling ( Pechstein et al . , 2010a ) . Figure 1 - 17 Schematic representation of the domain organization of Intersectin , Eps15 and Epsin . 1 . 3 . 2 Vesicle formation At the clathrin coat formation step , the scaffolding proteins Eps15 and intersectin recruit other accessory protein , such as Epsin1 and the AP2 complex . The AP2 complex consists of two large  and  2 subunits ( 110 kD ) , a µ2 subunit ( 50 kD ) , and a small  2 subunit ( 15 kD ) . The large subunits can be subdivided into an N - terminal trunk domain of 70 kD , which forms parts of the core and a C - terminal appendage domain of about 30 kD ( also called “ear” domain ) ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . The AP2 core binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched membranes ( Gaidarov et al . , 1996 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . Epsin1 has many different domains to interact Introduction 28 with various proteins related to endocytosis ( Figure 1 - 17 ) . The ENTH domain of Epsin1 binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched membranes . Insertion of an amphipathic helix from the ENTH domain into the membrane induces membrane curvature ( Figure 1 - 16B ) . Mutating residues within the hydrophobic region of this helix abolishes its ability to curve membranes ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Ford et al . , 2002 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ; Hussain et al . , 2003 ; Jakobsson et al . , 2008 ; Kweon et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2006 ; Yoon et al . , 2010 ) . The C - terminus of Epsin1 contains multiple binding sites for proteins involved in CCV formation ( Figure 1 - 17 ) , such as clathrin and the AP2 complex . Upon recruitement to the membrane , clathrin triskelia which are composed of three clathrin heavy and three light chains ( Figure 1 - 16C ) form a polyhedral lattice of hexagons and pentagons ( Figure 1 - 16 ) . Additionally , more recent studies suggest that F - BAR domain containing - protein FBP17 has a dual role in shaping and stabilizing membrane curvature using their F - BAR domain and in recruiting machinery for actin polymerization ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) . The latter may provide the force to push vesicle buds away from the plasma membrane . Blocking clathrin polymerization prevents deep membrane invaginations even in the presence of abundant membrane - tubulating proteins in the cytosol , thereby inhibiting clathrin - coated pit maturation at an early stage ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) . Actually , FBP17 may also aid membrane fission by generating longitudinal tension along the neck of the fissing vesicle . 1 . 3 . 3 Vesicle fission Deep clathrin - coated membrane invaginations finally undergo dynamin - mediated fission . Dynamins recruited to “neck region” of late stage clatthrin - coated pits via SH3 domain proteins bind to the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched plasma membranes via their PH domain . The hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin generates a conformational change within the protein causing scission of the clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 1 - 16C ) ( Danino and Hinshaw , 2001 ; De Camilli et al . , 1995 ; Hinshaw , 2000 ; Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Kelly , 1995 ; Lenz et al . , 2008 ; Liu and Robinson , 1995 ; McFadden and Ralph , 2003 ; Sever , 2002 ; Shpetner et al . , 1996 ; Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ; Warnock et al . , 1995 ) . Dynamins function together with BAR - SH3 domain proteins , such as amphiphysin , endophilin and sorting nexins in membrane fission . Dynamins binding to narrow tubules has the similar diameter as amphiphysin Introduction 29 and endophilin ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , although endophilin and amphiphysin have a similar morphology , endophilin cooligomerizes with dynamin - rings on lipid tubules and inhibits dynamin’s GTP - dependent vesiculating activity ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , while amphiphysin enhances liposome - fragmenting activity when it assembles with dynamin 1 into ring - like structures around tubules in the presence of GTP ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) . Additionally , another BAR domain - containing protein sorting nexin 9 , which contains an additional membrane binding phox homology ( PX ) domain right after its BAR domain and specifically binds to membrane phosphoinositides , has a similar function as endophilin in stabilizing dynamin 1 on the membrane even at the onset of stimulated GTP hydrolysis ( Ramachandran and Schmid , 2008 ) . A burst of sorting nexin 9 transiently recruited to CCPs during the late stages of vesicle formation coincides spatially and temporally with a burst of dynamin ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , actin filaments may provide part of the force to puch vesicles or membrane tubules away from the plasma membrane ( Suetsugu , 2009 ) ( Figure 1 - 16D ) . However , the importance of actin for clathrin - mediated endocytosis may depend on the sits of coated pits and the cell type . 1 . 4 Syndapins / Pacsins F - BAR - SH3 domain proteins , Syndapins ( synaptic dynamin - associated proteins ) are , a family of proteins also referred to as PACSINs ( Protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons ) , first identified in the brain . Syndapins show a remarkably high degree of conservation of both their domain structure and their amino acid sequence in species as diverse as worms , insect , fish , birds and mammals ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ) . Their putative F - BAR module has been proposed to deform membreanes . In mammals , there are three syndapin isoforms , syndapin I , syndapin II and syndapin III . All of them are composed of an N - terminal F - BAR domain , a flexible stretch that contains up to three NPF motifs , and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Braun et al . , 2005 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ) . Several studies suggest that syndapins play an important role in the structural organization and functional coordination of the endocytic process at synapses ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ; Anggono and Robinson , 2007 ; Anggono et al . , 2006 ; Clayton et al . , 2009 ; Da Costa et al . , 2003 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) . Introduction 30 1 . 4 . 1 Interactions of the syndapin protein family Previous studies have demonstrated that the N - terminal F - BAR domain of syndapins mediates self - association ( Halbach et al . , 2007 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ) as well as the stabilization of curved membrane domains , similar to what has been reported for other BAR family proteins ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . This proposal is also in agreement with the recently reported crystal structures of the F - BAR domains of FBP 17 and CIP14 ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . The SH3 domain of syndapin I is responsible for its interaction with dynamin ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) as well as with several molecules implicated in membrane trafficking and organization of the actin cytoskeleton . These include the phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphatase synaptojanin , a protein that plays a crucial role in the uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) , synapsin I , a protein associated with the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles ( Hilfiker et al . , 1999 ) , N - WASP ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 ; Nikki et al . , 2002 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) , Cordon - Bleu , a brain - enriched nulceator of unbranched actin filaments ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) , and EHD proteins ( Eps15 homology domain containing - proteins ) which mediate vesicle endocytosis and recycling ( Figure 1 - 18 ) ( Braun et al . , 2005 ) . Additionally , syndapins have been linked to signalling pathways , development and to Huntington’s disease ( Figure 1 - 18 ) . The interaction between syndapin and Son - of - sevenless ( mSos ) , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras , implicates syndapins in regulating signalling to mitogen - activated protein kinases ( Wasiak et al . , 2001 ) . Syndapin contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 ( Plomann et al . , 1998 ) , implying that syndapin function is regulated by signaling cascades . Syndapin binds to the cytoplasmic tails of members of the ADAM family proteins ( A Metalloprotease And Disintegrins ) and to NR3A - containing NMDA receptors ( Cousin et al . , 2000 ; Howard et al . , 1999 ; Mori et al . , 2003 ; Perez - Otano et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting roles in development and synaptic transmission . CD95L is a member of the tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) family of death factors and induces apoptosis ( Janssen et al . , 2003 ) . The association of syndapin with CD95L implicate syndapins in apoptosis ( Ghadimi et al . , 2002 ) . Huntington’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative genetic disorder , which affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and dementia caused by a CAG / polyglutamine repeat expansion in the first exon of the gene coding for Introduction 31 huntingtin ( Mangiarini et al . , 1996 ) . The specific interaction between huntingtin and neuronal syndapin 1 is enhanced in the case of mutant huntingtin and changes its intracellular distribution in pathological tissue , implying that syndapin 1 plays a role in the neuropathology of Huntington’s disease ( Modregger et al . , 2002 ) . Figure 1 - 18 Interactions of the syndapin protein family . Depicted are all syndapin interaction partners described , irrespective of species , syndapin isoform or splice variant ( modified from ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ) ) . 1 . 4 . 2 Syndapins play a role in endocytic pathway The NPF motifs of syndapins are recognized by the EH domain proteins , such as EHD1 ( Braun et al . , 2005 ) . Recent studies show that syndapin 1 directly and selectively binding to the carboxy - terminal domain of NR3A ( a subunit of the Introduction 32 NMDA receptor ) via its two NPF motifs assembles a protein complex comprising dynamin and clathrin ( Perez - Otano et al . , 2006 ) . NMDA receptors ( N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors ) are glutamate - gated ion channels that are pivotal in the regulation of synaptic function in the CNS ( cental nervous system ) . NMDARs are heteromeric assemblies of NR1 , NR2 and NR3 subunits . NR3A is expressed primarily during a narrow time window of postnatal development during which synaptic circuitry is established ( Wong et al . , 2002 ) Mice lacking NR3A show increased dendritic spine density ( Das et al . , 1998 ) , suggesting a potential role for this subunit in synapse maturation or elimination . NR3A shares only limited sequence homology with NR1 and NR2 and is equipped with a unique C - terminal domain that is different from other NMDAR subunits . Heteromeric receptors containing NR3A ( NR1 / NR2 / NR3A ) possess unique channel properties , including reduced calcium ( Ca 2 + ) permeability and low sensitivity to magnesium ( Mg 2 + ) blockade ( Das et al . , 1998 ; Perez - Otano et al . , 2006 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . The interaction between NR3A and syndapin 1 mediates robust endocytosis and synaptic removal of NR3A - containing NMDA receptors ( Perez - Otano et al . , 2006 ) . Syndapin 1 may function as an adaptor mediating endocytosis of NR3A - containing NMDA receptors endocytosis at distinct developmental stages . Similar to other BAR / F - BAR domain containing - proteins , syndapins not only generate membrane curvature / deformation using the F - BAR module but also bind via their SH3 domain to endocytic proteins such as dynamin and N - WASP . Like other BAR / F - BAR domain containing - proteins , syndapin 1 binds to synaptically enriched dynamin 1 . The interaction between syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 is specifically regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ) . Dynamin 1 dephosphorylation is mediated by the calcium - dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin during intense neuronal activity ( Cousin and Robinson , 2001 ; Cousin et al . , 2001 ) . Both dynamin 1 dephosphorylation and its downstream interaction with syndapin 1 are necessary for synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ) . Perturbation of the interaction between dynamin 1 and syndapin 1 specifically inhibits activity - dependent bulk endocytosis ( Clayton et al . , 2009 ) . In lamprey reticulospinal synapses , perturbation of syndapin has no effect on vesicle recycling under conditions of low - frequency stimulation in lamprey reticulospinal synapses , but disrupts synaptic vesicle recycling activated by intense stimulation Introduction 33 ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , perturbation of syndapin in lamprey reticulospinal synapses massively increases membranous cisternae and invaginations around release sites like “endosome - like structure” , but not of coated pits at the plasma membrane ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . These data suggest that syndapin 1 may increase the capacity of bulk retrieval of SV membranes during intense stimulation ( Cheung et al . , 2010 ) . However , this raises the question how syndapin invaginates and stabilizes the “endosome - like structures” ? Syndapin is composed of an F - BAR domain and an SH3 domain . Like other BAR domains , the dimerization of syndapin F - BAR is supposed to form a crescent - shaped module which could preferentially bind and stabilize “endosome - like structure” resulting from bulk endocytosis . The crystal structure of syndapin or its F - BAR domain may provide an explanation . Given that dynamin contains a membrane binding PH domain and the GTPase activity , dynamin together with syndapin may play a role in membrane shaping and membrane fission in the bulk endocytosis pathway . 1 . 4 . 3 Syndapin 1 shapes the plasma membrane Although syndapin 1 binds to dephosphorylated dynamin 1 and triggers bulk endocytosis during intense neuronal activity , its interaction with the actin nucleation promoting factor N - WASP plays an additional role in altering neuronal morphology during neuromorphogenesis and neuronal network formation ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . Recent studies show that overexpression of syndapin 1 in neurons highly increases the neurite number and dendrite branching . Both the SH3 domain and the F - BAR domain are necessary for this syndapin 1 - induced phenotype ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . Importantly , the influence of syndapin 1 on neuronal morphology depends on both N - WASP and the N - WASP - activating GTPase Cdc42 ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , knockdown of syndapin 1 does not change neurite number and dendrite branching , but rather increases aberrant axon branching , a phenotype also seen upon knockdown of either N - WASP or Arp2 / 3 complex ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . How precisely syndapin regulates neuromorphogenesis remains unknown . . Aims of this study 34 2 Aims of this study The aim of this work was to dissect the functions of syndapin in membrane deformation by combined structural , biochemical and cell biological approaches . Furthermore , we aimed at elucidating the precise molecular mechanism by which syndapin - mediated membrane deformation is coupled to dynamin - catalyzed membrane fission .

Routinely , PCR was also used to screen E . coli colonies after transformation with newly generated plasmid constructs ( Colony PCR ) . A standard PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 µl containing the following constituents : template DNA ( 0 . 1 - 1 µg ) , 1 x reaction buffer , 200 µM dNTPs , 1 µM of each primer , and 1 U of Vent - polymerase ( NEB ) . For colony PCRs , the final volume was 20 µl and Taq polymerase was used instead ( 0 . 25 U per reaction ) . The following is standard PCR recipe and program for amplification . ddH2O 37 μ l 10×Thermal buffer 5 μ l Template ( 100 ng / μ l ) 1 μ l dNTP mixture ( 5 mM / each ) 4 μ l forward primer ( 10 pmol / μ l ) 1 μ l reverse primer ( 10 pmol / μ l ) 1 μ l Vent polymerase + 1 μ l Total 50 μ l Materials and Methods 41 step time / min temperature / °C Process 1 5 95 1 cycle Initial denaturation 2 1 95 Denaturation 3 1 55 - 65 ( 55 ) * Annealing 4 1 - 5 * * 72 30 cycles steps 2 - 4 Elongation 5 10 72 1 cycle final elongation * for Colony PCRs using vector - specific primers * * depending on the length of the amplicon ( approx . 1 min per 1000 bp ) 3 . 2 . 2 Overlap extension PCR The overlap extension PCR was applied to insert specific point mutations . An internal mutagenic primer pair was designed totally or partially overlapping and including base substitutions resulting in the desired mutation . Each of these primers was used in a separate reaction together with an outer flanking primer designed to one end of the DNA region of interest . The two halfs generated by these PCRs were then used in one PCR as partly overlapping templates together with the two outer flanking primers to amplify the final amplicon containing the desired mutation . 3 . 2 . 3 Agarose gel electrophoresis and gel extraction Agarose gels were used to separate PCR amplicons , restricted inserts and vectors . They were prepared in a concentration of 0 . 7 , 1 , 1 . 5 or 2 % agarose ( w / v ) in 1x TBE buffer . DNA solutions were mixed with 6x loading dye prior to loading onto the gel . PCR products or digested vectors were loaded on agarose gels and run at 100 V . Subsequently , the DNA was stained in an ethidium bromide ( EtBr ) containing water bath . The stained DNA was visualised by UV illumination of the gel . DNA bands of the desired size were cut and the DNA was extracted according to manufacture’s kit instruction . 3 . 2 . 4 DNA restriction digest and dephosphorylation of vector DNA 1 - 5 µg plasmid DNA or isolated PCR products were digested in a final volume of 50 µl containing NEBuffer ( 10x stock ) , BSA ( 10x stock ) , and 10 U ( or 50 U for 5 µg plasmid ) of restriction enzymes . The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 2 h or overnight . Digested PCR amplicons were purified using a Cycle Pure Column ( PeqLab ) . Inserts and vectors were extracted from preparative agarose gels . Materials and Methods 42 In order to prevent re - ligation of the vector backbone , linearized plasmid DNA was 5’ - dephosphorylated before ligation . 0 . 5 units calf intestine phosphatase ( NEB ) were used for 1 µg of vector DNA in any NEB buffer directly after the restriction enzyme digest . The dephosphorylation reaction was performed at 37°C for 10 min . Afterwards , the DNA was purified using the E . Z . N . A . Cycle Pure kit ( PeqLab ) . 3 . 2 . 5 Ligation of DNA inserts into linearized vectors For ligation , vector and insert DNA were combined in a 1 : 3 molar ratio in a total volume of 20 µl including reaction buffer and 1 U T4 - DNA ligase . Samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h or at 4°C overnight . Then , the ligation mix was applied for the transformation of chemically competent E . coli TOP10 cells 3 . 2 . 6 Preparation of chemically competent E . coli cells To prepare chemically competent E . coli TOP10 , or BL21 , or ER2566 straints , one fresh colony from an overnight agar plate was inoculated into 5 ml LB medium for overnight culture at 37°C . This overnight culture ( 1ml ) was inoculated into 50 ml LB medium grown at 37°C until the OD 600 reached 0 . 4 ( 2 x 10 8 cells / ml ) . Cells were centrifuged at 2500 xg and 4°C for 10 min . The supernatant was discarded and the pellert were resuspended in 10 ml of 0 . 1 M CaCl 2 solution and incubated on ice for at least 15 to 30 min up to 3 h .

Overnight cultures were usually diluted 1 : 20 in 2xYT - medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and incubated in a shaker at 37°C until the OD 600 reached 0 . 6 to 0 . 8 . Protein expression was induced by adding 0 . 5 mM ( final concentration ) Isopropyl -  - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and expressed overnight ( about 10 h ) at 28°C . If needed , the expression temperature was lowered to 18°C to increase the solubility of the recombinant proteins . After overexpression , the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 5300 rpm for 15 min at 4°C . After removal of the medium , the cell pellets of 1 liter culture were resuspended in 40 to 100 ml ice - cold lysis buffer ( depending on the expected yield ) and stored at - 20°C . Materials and Methods 45 His 6 - Selenomethionine - substituted syndapin 1 - ( 1 - 337 ) ( abbreviated as SeMet - synd 1 - 337 later on ) was prepared as described ( Van Duyne et al . , 1993 ) . Briefly , overnight cultures ( 1 ml LB medium ) were gently centrigued at 1300 xg at room temperature for 1 ~ 2 min , gently resuspended pellet in 1 ml M9 culture medium , inoculated to 250 ml M9 culture medium , and grown at 37°C until OD 600 reached 0 . 3 ( growth is really slow - from 1 / 2 to 1 / 5 of the usual growth rate for the strain in rich medium ) . Solid amino acid supplements were added to the culture . After 15 min for inhibition of methionine synthesis to start , the cloned protein expression was induced by 0 . 5 mM IPTG .

The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min and sonicated for 2x 60 s with 70 % power and 50 % duty cycle . Subsequently , 1 % Triton X - 100 ( or 2 % CHAPS in some cases ) was added , incubated for 20 min , centrifuged for 15 min at 24 , 000rpm at 4°C and ultrafiltered by 0 . 45 μ m filterer ( Amicon ® Ultra ) . The supernatant was loaded to a Ni - NTA column ( Novagen ) with the flow rate at 1 ml / min and extensively washed by washing buffer . The binding proteins were eluted by elution buffer . The elution fractions were concentrated and incubated with thrombin ( Sigma ) ( 1 U / mg ) and 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 ( Sigma ) at 4 ℃ overnight , and then loaded onto a Sephadex 200 size - exclusion column for further purification using 50 mM HEPES ( pH7 . 4 ) , 200 mM NaCl as running buffer . The purity was confirmed by SDS - PAGE . All purified samples were concentrated using centrifugal filter tubes ( Millipore and Amicon Bioseparations ) and were aliquoted into 100 µl and stored at - 80 ℃ for further studies . 3 . 3 . 4 Protein quantification - Bradford assay 1 µl for His x6 fusion proteins or 2 µl for GST fusion proteins were diluted in water to a final volume of 500 µl and mixed with 500 µl of 2 x Bradford reagent . The absorption at 595 nm was determined after incubation for 10 min at room temperature . 1 x Bradford reagent ( 500 µl 2 x Bradford reagent diluted 1 : 1 in water ) was used as a blank . The protein content was calculated from a reference curve determined with BSA as a standard . 3 . 3 . 5 In vitro binding Assays Binding buffer : 20 mM HEPES - Na ( pH7 . 4 ) 50 mM NaCl 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 For direct binding assays , immobilized GST fusion proteins ( 20 μ g ) were incubated in a total volume of 500 μ l binding buffer for 2 h at 4 with recombinant ℃ His 6 - tagged proteins ( 60 or 80 μ g ) in presence or absence of peptides ( 100 μ M ) . Materials and Methods 47 10 - 15 μ l GST binding resin was added if the beads volume was too low . For salt sensitive experiment , the concentration of NaCl was 50 mM , 100 mM , 200 mM and 400 mM . Samples were washed extensively using binding buffer . Complexes were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . 3 . 3 . 6 SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) To separate proteins according to their size , SDS polyacrylamide gels were casted with varying concentrations : 9 - 12 % acrylamide for the separating gel , and 3 % for the stacking gel . Protein samples for electrophoresis were mixed with sample buffer , denatured at 95°C for 3 min and loaded onto the gel . Electrophoresis was performed in 1 x SDS - PAGE running buffer with a constant 20 mA per gel . Afterwards , the gels were stained with Commassie blue followed by a destaining procedure to detect the protein bands and analyze the complex formation . For salt sensitive experiments , Protein band intensities were quantified by Image J . 3 . 4 Cell Biology 3 . 4 . 1 Mammalian cell culture Freezing medium : 10 % DMSO 90 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) COS - 7 cells were used as model mammalian cell line for immunofluorescence and transferrin uptake experiments in this study . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( D - MEM ) containing glutamate , sodium pyruvate , pyridoxine and glucose ( 1 g / l ) . Medium were supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated ( 30 min , 56°C ) fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and antibiotics ( 50 units / ml penicillin , 50 µg / ml streptomycin ) . Cells were passaged twice a week using trypsin / EDTA solution for detachment , plated at 1 : 5 - 1 : 20 dilutions onto culture dishes , and incubated at 37°C , 5 % carbon dioxide , and 95 % humidity . For Long - Term Storage of Cell Lines , the cells were disattached from a 10 cm tissue culture dish by treatment with 2 ml trypsin / EDTA ( GibcoBRL , Eggenstein ) . Trypsin / EDTA was inactivated by the addition of 8 ml serum containing medium . Cells were centrifuged at 200 x g for 3 minutes and resuspended the pellet in 3 ml Materials and Methods 48 freezing medium . 1 ml aliquots were frozen at - 80°C and transferred to liquid nitrogen from1 day to half a year after freezing . 3 . 4 . 2 Transfection of mammalian cells with plasmid DNA For transfection of cell lines with plasmid constructs , Lipofectamine TM 2000 ( Invitrogen ) was used as reagent to transfect mammalian cells with plasmid DNA , essentially according to manufacturer’s instructions with minor variations . The liposome - based transfection method was applied on cells having a confluency of about - 50 % in this study . For 6 - well plates , 2 µg DNA and 4 µl Lipofectamine per well were diluted into 2x 100 µl Optimem , respectively . Plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine were mixed in Optimem in separate polystyrol tubes and incubated for 5 min at room temperature , and then both mixtures were combined . After 25 min incubation the solution was added to the cells for transfection and incubated for 2 h at 37°C before changing the medium with appropriate antibiotics . Cells were analyzed after 10 - 15 h transfection . 3 . 4 . 3 Live cell confocal imaging experiment We used live cell confocal imaging assay to study the membrane tubulation ability of syndapin or syndapin F - BAR alone . Cos7 cells expressing low levels of fluorescent proteins were imaged after 10 - 15 h post - transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M - based PerkinElmer Life Science UltraView ERS dual spinning disc system . Compared with conventional optical microscopy , spinning disc confocal microscopy has several advantages , including widefield , laser scanning confocal microscopy and acquisition of images at very high frame rates with minimum illumination of samples . Particularly , the spinning disc confocal microscopy is able to apply high speed 3D imaging of living systems . The microscopy with a closet was prewarmed at 37°C with humidity and 5 % carbon dioxide . The coverslip with cells was mounted to a metal champer with 1ml prewarmed 1x HBSS buffer supplemented with 5 % FCS , 1 mM Ca 2 + and 1 mM Mg 2 + . Data were processed using Volocity software ( Improvision ) . For quantification , at least 20 transfected cells were chosen for each experiment . The numbers of tubules were manually determined , and the average number of tubules per cell was calculated . Cells of interest from at least three different independent experiments Materials and Methods 49 were collected and used for quantification . 3 . 4 . 4 Electron microscopy analysis of Cos7 cells Cos7 cells grown on the glass coverslips were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS and postfixed with aqueous 1 % osmium tetroxide solution , dehydrated and finally flat embedded in Epon as described elsewhere ( Mundigl et al . , 1993 ) . Upon resin polymerization , glass was removed using liquid nitrogen and hot water . 50 nm sections were cut paralel to the coverslip , stained with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips EM 208 electron microscope . Images were taken at 20 , 000x magnification and negatives scanned at 1200 dpi . The diameter of membrane tubules was calculated by Image Tool software . More than 10 membrane tubules were selected for each image . . 3 . 4 . 5 Transferrin uptake assay Normally , the fluorescence - labeled transferrin ( Tf ) internalization is used as a read out for endocytosis . Here we used transferrin uptake assay to determine the origin of membrane tubules which were generated by overexpression of syndapin F - BAR in Cos 7 cells . Transfected Cos7 cells were serum - starved for 2h using DMEM medium without anything . Alexa Fluor 568 - Tf ( Molecular Probes ) was diluted into serum free medium with a final concentration of 25 µg / ml and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 5 min . The starved cells grown on the coverslip were transferred upside - down onto a droplet of transferring solution ( ~ 50 µl ) and incubated for 10 min or 30 mim at 37°C in a prewarmed humidity chamber . The humidity chamber was immediately placed on ice after incubation . The cells was transferred back to 6 - well plates and washed three times with ice - cold 1x PBS buffer . The cells were immediately used for living cell confocal image analysis . The live cell imaging was processed as described in 3 . 4 . 3 . 3 . 5 Protein crystallography 3 . 5 . 1 Crystallizaiton Two of the most commonly methods - hanging drop and sitting drop for protein crystallization are used in this study . Initially , a droplet ( 2 μ l ) containing 1 μ l purified Materials and Methods 50 protein and 1 μ l precipitant in different buffers were added onto 96 - well crystallization plate and equilibrated with a larger ( 100 μ l ) reservoir containing similar buffers and precipitants in higher concentrations . As water vaporizes from the drop and transfers to the reservoir , the precipitant concentration increases to a level optimal for crystallization . Crystals were grown at 291K by the sitting - drop vapor diffusion method using Hampton Screen kit I & kit II , Hampton PEG / ION screen and Emerald Wizard I & II as a starting point . For protein - protein complex , Hampton screen Protein Complex Kit was used for the initialing screening . All of the above products use the sparse matrix method , which is based on the successful conditions reported before . The 96 - well crystallization plates were inspected every day at first week and then every week . All changes were recorded in special forms . The conditions with crystals were optimized by changing are protein concentration , temperature , buffer , pH , precipitant , salt and additives ( Hampton Research additive screen kits ) . 2 μ l or 4 μ l protein samples were used for crystal optimization to obtain a single and well - diffracted crystal . The hanging drop method was used for crystallization opitimiztion . 12 well - plates were used once crystallization conditions were screened . The reservoir was filled with 1 ml of precipitant solution with buffer ( called reservoir solution ) . The crystallization drop was mixed with 2 μ l or 4 μ l protein samples and 2 μ l or 4 μ l reservoir solution and was placed on a siliconised glass plate and placed over the reservoir . Usually , 4 smaller drops are able to be placed on a siliconised glass plate , which normally can be used for optimizing the different protein concentration in the same condition . As usual , the crystallization drops were inspected every day at first week and then every week . All conditions and changes are recored in special forms . Normally , the protein sample concentration is more than 5 mg / ml for crystallization trial . In this study , Syndapin 1 full - length protein was concentrated to 2 . 5 - 15 mg / ml in 50 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 200 mM NaCl sample buffer ; Syndapin 1 was mixed with EHD1 - ( 401 - 534 ) at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 and concentrated to 25 mg / ml in 50 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 200 mM NaCl sample buffer ; SeMet - syndapin 1 ( 1 - 337 ) was concentrated to 10 mg / ml in 50 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 200 mM NaCl sample buffer . Materials and Methods 51 More than 20 conditions using PEG 3350 as the precipitant appeared crystals of full - length syndapin 1 , but they were very thin and flat even after optimization . These crystals were diffracted to the very low resolution ( about 17 Å ) . One condition was targeted and opitimized : 8 % PEG 4000 and 0 . 1 M sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 6 ) . This condtion gave good crystals at three - dimension , even though the size of crystal was small . The single and big crystals were obtained when decreasing the concentration of PEG 4000 to 3 - 5 % and increasing the pH of sodium acetate buffer up to 5 . 0 - 5 . 5 . However , the best crystals were obtained with the additive glycyl - glycyl - glycine ( 10 mM final concentration ) or NiCl 2 ( 10 mM final concentration ) which were selected from Hampton Addtive Screen Kit . Crystals of Syndapin 1 / EHD1 - ( 401 - 534 ) complex formed after one month under the following conditions : ( 1 ) 10 % PEG 4000 , 0 . 2 M sodium acetate and 0 . 1 M sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 5 ) and ( 2 ) 15 % PEG 6000 and 0 . 1 M sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 3 ) . These crystals were ready to be diffracted without any opitimization . However , it turned out to be the degraded syndpain 1 - F - BAR domain . Crystal of SeMet - syndapin 1 ( 1 - 337 ) formed under the following conditions : ( 1 ) 5 % or 10 % PEG 6000 and 0 . 1 M Citric acid pH 4 . 0 or pH 5 . 0 , ( 2 ) 0 . 2 M Tri - potassium citrate and 20 % PEG 3350 , ( 3 ) 0 . 1 M Sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 0 ) and 20 % MPD ( 2 - methylpentan - 2 , 4 - diol ) and ( 4 ) 5 % iso - propanol and 2 . 0 M ammounium sulfate . However , the crystals from condition ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) were always very small even after optimization . The quality of crystals was increased after optimizing condition ( 1 ) . The condition was 4 - 6 % PEG 6000 and 0 . 1 M citric acid ( pH 5 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) . The replacement precipitant PEG 6000 with PEG 3350 also improved the crystals . The best diffraction data were from crystals under the condtion 10 % PEG 3350 and 0 . 1 M sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 5 ) . 3 . 5 . 2 X - ray data collection and processing All the diffraction experiments were carried out at low temperature ( 100K ) . The crystals need to be freezed during data collection , which normally minimizes the effects of radiation damage at high brilliance tightly focused X - ray beams available at synchrontron beamlines and prolongs the lifes of crystal in the X - ray beam . To prevent crystals from damage and the formation of so - called ice - ring during the Materials and Methods 52 diffraciton , cryo - protectants ( such as Glycerol , MPD , glucose , PEG… ) were used together with the reservoir solution . F - BAR , Ful 1 , and SeMet - F - BAR crystals were cryo - protected by shortly soaking in their reservoir solution plus 20 % glycerol and 15 % polyethylene glycol 3350 , then frozen directly in the cold N2 stream , which is called “flash cooling” ; the Ful - 2 crystal was cryo - protected by steadily increasing the polyethylene glycol 4000 concentration in the reservoir solution until approaching 40 % and frozen in liquid N2 . All X - ray diffraction data were collected at Berlin BESSY synchrotron ( beamline 14 . 1 ) ( Table 1 ) . The crystal structure of F - BAR degraded from Syndapin 1 / EHD1 - ( 401 - 534 ) complex was determined to a resolution of 2 . 45 Å in the space group C2221 . Full length syndapin 1 has two forms which were diffracted to a maximal resolution of 3 . 4 and 2 . 6 Å in the same space group C2221 . For SeMet - F - BAR , three data sets ( peak , inflection and remote ) were collected as shown in Table 1 . These data sets were used to solve phase problem of syndapin . All the X - ray diffraction data were collected on CCD detectors . The diffraction data were measured using the rotation method by oscillating a small angle of crystal sample ( 0 . 3° was normally used in this work ) . The exposure time depends on the quality of crystals . Normally , increasing the exposure time improves the diffraction resolution . But it cannot use high exposure time , because it also increases backgroup noise . Data from native syndapin 1 crystals were processed with XDS ( Kabsch , 1993 ) ; data from the selenomethionine syndapin 1 crystal were indexed and integrated with Mosflm ( Leslie , 2006 ) and Scala ( 1994 ) . Data were analyzed and merged with XPREP ( Bruker , Madison , WI ) . The data statistics are summarized in Table 1 ( in Results Section ) . 3 . 5 . 3 Structure determination The phase problem occurs when making a physical measurement in X - ray crystallography . Although the diffraction data of a crystal contains the structure factors magnitudes , the information of its phase has been lost during the diffraction process . In order to reconstruct the electron density map , the phase problem has to be solved . Various approaches have been developed over the years . They are direct Materials and Methods 53 methods , Patterson function , molecular replacement ( MR ) , multiple isomorphous replacement ( MIR ) and multiple anomalous dispersion ( MAD ) . Molecular replacement method is normally used to solve the phase problem when a homologue protein or homology domain has been previously determined . Normally , they should share at least 30 % sequence identity and have less than 1 Å root mean squar deviation ( r . m . s . d ) . Although the crystal structure of several BAR domains has been determined . Low sequence identity and the different BAR domain curvature , molecular replacement was not able to solve the phase problem of syndapin . MAD method by soaking crystals or co - crystallizing with heavy atom ( like Mercury ( II ) acetate , Mercury ( II ) chloride , Uranyl nitrate and NiCl 2 ) was also used to solve the phase problem of syndapin . However , owing to low quality of data set , it failed to give a reasonable structural solution . Multi - wavelength anomalous dispersion ( also called Multi - wavelength anomalous diffraction ) is another technique used in X - ray crystallography to solve the phase problem of biological macromolecules . The phase problem became possible to be solved if the structure contains more than one atom ( including one atom ) that causes significant anomalous scattering . The most common way is to replace methionine residues with selenomethionine in a protein by using selective medium during protein expression as described in section 3 . 3 . 1 . The selenium atoms have a strong anomalous signal at different wavelengths X - rays generated at a synchrotron . By collecting data at several wavelengths near the absorption edge of the selenium atom in the crystal , phase information can be obtained . The structure of F - BAR domain was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method assisted by the selenomethionine - derived crystal . The selenium substructure was solved by SHELXD ( Schneider and Sheldrick , 2002 ) . Then , the phases were calculated , improved and extended to 2 . 9Å resolution by SHELXE ( Sheldrick , 2008 ) . Initial helical fragments were built automatically by Arp _ Warp ( Morris et al . , 2004 ) . Phases were further improved via NCS averaging implemented in DM and extended to 2 . 5Å using the native data . Subsequently , model building and refinement were carried out alternately . The full - length syndapin 1 structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) . The refined F - BAR dimer / monomer Materials and Methods 54 and the SH3 domain of 2DRK were used as searching models . 3 . 5 . 4 Model building and refinement The model was gradually built and adjusted by hand using Xtalview ( McRee , 1999 ) , by fitting the model into the electron density map with the consideration of chemical geometry . Omit maps were used intensively to confirm the constructed parts . The selenium atoms were used to trace the polypeptide chain . Side chains lacking defined electron density were left on their geometric positions , provided the main chain was traced into well - defined electron density . Atomic positions , individual B factors , group TLS parameters , an overall anisotropic scaling factor and a bulk solvent model were refined using refmac5 ( Murshudov et al . , 1997 ) with tight geometric and B factor restraints to maximize the amplitude based likelihood function . TLS groups were either assigned by TLSMD web server ( Painter and Merritt , 2006 ) or each chain arbitrarily assigned as one group . Rfree was used to monitor all refinement cycles . Other CCP4 programs were heavily used in the crystallographic calculations ( 1994 ) . The geometry of the final models was validated by PROCHECK ( Laskowski et al . , 1993 ) . Analysis of the domain interfaces was performed with PISA web server ( Krissinel and Henrick , 2007 ) . Structure figures were made with Pymol ( DeLano Scientific , Palo Alto , CA ) . Coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2x3v for the structure of the F - BAR domain , 2x3w and 2x3x for the structures of full - length syndapin 1 . 3 . 6 Tubulation assay in vitro 3 . 6 . 1 Liposome preparation To prepare 1 mg / ml liposome sample for electrom microscopy analysis of protein - lipid tubes , a stock solution of 1 , 2 - Dioleoyl - sn - Glycero - 3 - [ Phospho - L - Serine ] ( PS ; Avanti Polar Lipids cat . # 840035 ) was mixed ( w / v ) with 100µl of chloroform and 30µl of methanol in a glass vials , dried in glass tubes using Ar gas using slow - flow Nitrogen ( 0 . 1 units ) to produce a film on the glass and incubated in a vacuum desiccator overnight . The mixture of lipid was rehydrated in PBS ( pH 7 . 2 ) at Materials and Methods 55 room temperature for 5 minutes and gently agitated occasionally . Liposomes were extruded through 0 . 4 µm polycarbonate filters using a mini lipid extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . The liposome was push 3 - 11 times through the filter and deposited into a buffer - rinsed glass vial . 3 . 6 . 2 Electron microscopy analysis of protein - lipid tubes Proteins were added at a concentration of 0 . 1 mg / ml to liposomes and the protein - lipid solution was incubated for 90 min at room temperature . For the EM analysis carbon - coated copper mesh grids ( 200 mesh , EMS ) were put on droplets of protein - lipid solution for 1 min before negative staining in 1 % uranyl acetate . Protein - lipid tube structures were observed and photographed at 80 kV in a Tecnai 12 electron microscope . NIH Image J software was used to quantify the length of protein - lipid tubes . Two - sided Student’s t - test was used to compare the means . 3 . 6 . 3 Liposome sedimentation assay Proteins were spun down separately before mixing with liposomes to remove aggregates prior to mixing with lipids . Protein - lipid samples ( prepared as described above ) were centrifuged at 200 , 000 x g for 1 h at room temperature in an ultracentrifuge ( Beckman ) or in an Airfuge  ultracentrifuge ( Beckman ) at top speed for 60 min at room temperature . Supernatant was removed and mixed 1 : 1 in sample buffer ( 200 mM Tris - HCl , 4 % SDS , 16 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % Bromophenol blue , pH 6 . 8 ) . Pellets were resuspended in 2x sample buffer . Samples were boiled , analyzed by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . Protein band intensities were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS3 software . Results 56 4 Results 4 . 1 Syndapin 1 - F - BAR but not full - length syndapin 1 forms membrane tubules in living cells As mentioned before , syndapin 1 is comprised of an N - terminal F - BAR linked to a C - terminal dynamin - binding SH3 domain via a long flexible tether containing two NPF motifs ( Figure 4 - 1A ) . Similar to other BAR family proteins , such as endophilin , amphiphysin , CIP4 and FBP17 , the N - terminal F - BAR domain of syndapins is required for self - association and for the stabilization of curved membrane domains ( Halbach et al . , 2007 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ) . As shown in Figure 1 - 11 , numerous membrane tubules were generated upon overexpression of BAR / F - BAR domain or BAR / F - BAR domain containing proteins in Cos 7 cells . To analyze its potential membrane - tubulating activity full - length mouse syndapin 1 fused to eGFP was expressed in Cos7 cells and imaged by live cell spinning disc confocal microscopy . Surprisingly , syndapin 1 - eGFP displayed a largely cytoplasmic distribution with some enrichment at peripheral plasmalemmal ruffles but no syndapin 1 - coated membrane tubules or vesicles were observed ( Figure 4 - 1B and D ) . By contrast , expression of syndapin 1 - F - BAR - eGFP , a truncation mutant lacking the C - terminal linker - SH3 domain , produced numerous membrane tubules from internal mostly perinuclear membranes ( Figure 4 - 1C and E ) with an average diameter of about 73 ± 10 nm ( Figure 4 - 1E ) which was determined by analysis of Cos7 cells overexpressing syndapin 1 - F - BAR - eGFP using electron microscopy . To determine the origin of these membrane tubules , the fluorescence - labeled transferrin ( Tf ) internalization assay was used . Interestingly , most of these tubules were accessible to internalized transferrin - Alexa568 ( Figure 4 - 2 ) , suggesting that they were of endosomal origin . Besides membrane tubules , overexpression of syndapin 1 - F - BAR - eGFP also induced membrane protrusions ( Figure 4 - 3 ) . These were not seen in cells overexpressing full - length syndapin ( Figure 4 - 1B ) .

Figure 4 - 2 eGFP - syndapin 1 - F - BAR induced membrane tubules contain internalized transferrin .

Figure 4 - 3 Membrane protrusions were formed by overexpression of syndapin 1 - F - BAR in living Cos7 cells . Membrane protrusions in two Cos7 cells are indicated by arrow . Scale bars , 10 μ m . All these data show that syndapin 1 harbors a potent membrane tubulating activity within its F - BAR domain that is suppressed in the full - length protein . The reason could be posttranslational modification , or the fusion of GFP tag . As shown in Figure 1 - 18 , syndapin not only can interact with other proteins but also can be homo - oligomerized , so the membrane tubulating activity of syndapin could be also inhibited by self - association or interaction with other proteins . Given that syndapin contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 ( Plomann et al . , 1998 ) , the membrane tubulating activity of syndapin could be also regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphorylation . The crystal structure of syndapin may provide some clues to explain the reason why the membrane tubulating actvitity of syndapin is blocked . 4 . 2 Protein expression and purification In order to investigate the molecular basis of syndapin 1 F - BAR domain mediated membrane tubulation , we aimed at solve the crystal structure of syndapin 1 - F - BAR and full - length syndapin 1 . For this purpose , syndapin 1 full - length and syndapin 1 - ( 1 - 337 ) cDNAs were inserted into the pET28 ( + ) vector which carries a His x6 - tag for affinity purification and a thrombin cleavage sites after the His x6 - tag . As described in Material and Methods section , plasmids encoding syndapin 1 full - length and syndapin 1 - ( 1 - 337 ) cDNAs were transformed into E . coli BL21 competent cells . Expression of His x6 - tag fusion proteins were induced by IPTG at 28°C , overnight . As Results 59 shown in Figure 4 - 4 , soluble syndapin 1 or syndapin 1 - ( 1 - 337 ) was detected in the supernatant . The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni - NTA column and extensively washed with buffer containing 15mM imidazole . After elution , fractions were concentrated and applied to a gel filtration column for further purification . Peak fractions for syndapin 1 and SeMet - synd 1 ( 1 - 337 ) are shown in Figure 4 - 5 . The purity was analysed by SDS - PAGE . Routinely , 10 mg protein was recovered after gel flitration purification from 1 L expressed bacterial culture .

Synd 1 is full - length syndapin 1 , while SeMet - Synd 1 is selenomethionine - syndapin 1 . 4 . 3 Protein crystallization and structure determination More details are described in Material and Methods section for crystallization of syndapin 1 , syndapin / EHD1 ( 401 - 534 ) complex and SeMet - Syndapin 1 - F - BAR . Crystals of syndapin 1 full - length were obtained from the solution by mixing 2 μ l protein solution with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mM Na - acetate ( pH 5 . 0 ) , 3 - 5 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol 4000 and 10 mM glycyl - glycyl - glycine ( from additive screen ) ( Figure 4 - 6A ) . In an attempt to crystallize a syndapin / EHD1 ( 401 - 534 ) complex , Syndapin 1 was mixed with EHD1 at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 . Crystals appeared after one month in drops consisting of 2 μ l of the protein complex solution and 2 μ l reservoir solution containing 100 mM sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 5 ) , 10 % ( w / v ) Polyethylene Glycol 4000 and 200 mM Na - acetate ( pH 5 . 0 ) . Unexpectedly , the crystals only contained the F - BAR domain of syndapin 1 due to protein degradation , which has the same space group with similar parameters of the cell unit as SeMet - F - BAR ( F - BAR , Table 1 ) . The degraed band ( labelled crystal ) was shown in Figure 4 - 7 . SeMet - syndapin 1 - ( 1 - 337 ) crystals were obtained from crystallization drops containing 2 μ l SeMet - syndapin - ( 1 - 337 ) mixed with 2 μ l reservoir solution 100 mM sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 5 ) , 10 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol - 3350 ( SeMet - F - BAR , Table 1 ) . The crystal structure of F - BAR was determined to a resolution of 2 . 45 Å in the space group C2221 ( a = 85 . 06 Å , b = 153 . 49 Å , c = 212 . 29 Å ) ( Figure 4 - 6B ) . Full length syndapin 1 has two forms which were diffracted to a maximal resolution of 3 . 4 and 2 . 6 Å in the space group C2221 ( Ful - 1 : a = 83 . 08 Å , b = 154 . 54 Å , c = 255 . 81 Å ; Ful - 2 : a = 88 . 28 Å , b = 154 . 61 Å , c = 191 . 74 Å ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Crystal structures were solved using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction ( MAD ) method ( Table 1 ) . The data for MAD was colletcted on a crystal grown from selenomethionine - derivatized protein . SeMet - F - BAR has the same space group as F - BAR with cell dimension a = 85 . 4 Å , b = 153 . 5 Å , c = 215 . 3 Å . After SHELXD processing , the phaser density map was obtained and positions of selenomethionine were indicated in Figure 4 - 8 . The SeMet - F - BAR model was built according to amino acid sequence and fit into the Results 61 electron density map . The full - length syndapin 1 structures were solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of SeMet - F - BAR as a searching model . Coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2x3v for the structure of the F - BAR domain , 2x3w and 2x3x for the structures of full - length syndapin 1 , respectively .

D or E refers to SH3 domain , which should be assigned with the same ID of its relevant F - BAR domain , i . e . A , B or C . However , lacking electron density for the 80aa linker region between the F - BAR and SH3 domains made either assignment uncertain , so different chain IDs were assigned . Figure 4 - 8 Electron density map of SeMet - F - BAR after SHELXD processing . The electron density map is colorated in blue . Positions of Selenomethionine are indicated in light - pink density . The main chain model is fitted into the electron density map with orange color . 4 . 4 Overall crystal structure of syndapin I F - BAR Three F - BAR monomers sit in one crystal asymmetric unit : Two monomers dimerize into an elongated “S” shape with local twofold symmetry ( Figure 4 - 9 ) , while the third forms a dimer with its crystal symmetry - related mate . Each monomer consists of four long helices , α 1 to α 4 , and a short C - terminal helix α 5 following an extended proline - rich coil ( Figure 4 - 9A and D ) . The head - to - head dimerization of F - BAR domains results in a six - helical bundle consisting of α 1 , α 2 , and the N - terminal part of α 4 from each monomer and a buried solvent - accessible area of about 4 , 600 Å 2 , indicating a stable dimer in solution . A coiled - coil consisting of α 3 and the C - terminal part of α 4 of each monomer bends to the same side and thus gives the dimer a crescent shape . A striking feature is the charge distribution on the dimer surface : On the concave face , lysines ( e . g . , K127 , K130 , K145 , K146 , K148 , K205 , and K208 ) form a continuous positively charged belt ( Figure 4 - 9F ) which is necessary for membrane binding , whereas the convex and side surfaces are Results 64 negatively charged . The characteristics in scaffold organization and charge distribution are shared with other BAR proteins . Figure 4 - 9 Structure of the syndapin 1 F - BAR domain .

( E , F ) The protein surface is colored according to electric potential : red ( negative ) through white ( neutral ) to blue ( positive ) . Residues mutated in the functional study are labeled . The wedge loop is indicated by a black circle 4 . 5 Distinct features of the F - BAR domain of syndapin Compared with other determined crystal structures of F - BAR domain , an interesting feature in syndapin is that a wedge loop consisting of 119 HKQIMGGF 126 , with hydrophobic residues ( I122 - M123 ) at the tip ( Figure 4 - 9B , C , D and E ) , protrudes about 12 Å from the area joining α 2 and α 3 . These two helices compose an uninterrupted long helix in other BAR proteins . This wedge loop distinguishes syndapin 1 from known N - BAR and F - BAR proteins . Superposing monomers available from different crystal - packing environments reveals the rigidity of the Results 65 wedge loop ( Figure 4 - 9C ) , namely the overall shape and the relative orientation to the helical bundle . Two wedges , with a tip - to - tip distance of about 83 Å in the dimer , are located on the borders of the positively charged concave face and are adjacent to positively charged , conserved residues ( e . g . , K127 and K130 ) . This suggests a concerted function of the wedge loop with the charged surface in membrane bending . The importance of the wedge loop and the adjacent charged surface for the membrane - tubulating activity of eGFP - F - BAR was confirmed by expression of site - directed mutants in Cos7 cells . Replacing the hydrophobic amino acids I122 and M123 within the wedge loop ( Figure 4 - 9B ) by hydrophilic residues ( I122T / M123Q ) completely eliminated tubule formation in cells ( Figure 4 - 10B and E ) , although this mutation did not alter membrane phospholipid binding . Interestingly , if residues I122 and M123 were mutated to a bulkier hydrophobic phenylalanine , the number of tubules per cell was significantly increased ( Figure 4 - 10A and E ) . Additionally , the replacement of either of two basic patches ( K127E / K130E or K145E / K146E / K148E ) within the positively charged belt on F - BAR eliminated membrane tubulation ( Figure 4 - 10C and D ) . These data are in agreement with the structural analysis and confirm the critical role of the positively charged belt and the amphipathic wedge loop in driving syndapin 1 F - BAR - mediated membrane bending . Figure 4 - 10 The wedge loop and positively charged residues are important for the membrane tubulating activity of syndapin 1 - F - BAR domain .

The structures of F - BAR domain dimers from syndapin 1 , FCHO2 , Syp 1 , CIP4 , and FBP17 are shown . Protein coloration : Syndapin 1 F - BAR as Figure 4 - 7 ; FCHO2 F - BAR : blue ; Syp 1 F - BAR : red ; CIP4 F - BAR : cyan ; FBP17 F - BAR : tint . The degree of “wing” bending was quantified by determining the angle between the long axis of the central 6 - helix bundle ( concave surface ) and the long axis of the helical “wing” region . The degree for each F - BAR domain is indicated . Another striking feature of syndapin 1 - F - BAR is a highly kinked lateral “wing” relative to the central dimerization region in syndapin . F - BAR domains of CIP4 and FBP17 are rather straight and FCHO2 F - BAR has an only moderately kinked “wing” ( Figure 4 - 11 ) ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . Although Results 67 the F - BAR domain of Syp1 displays high curvature of the wing region , this “wing” region is very short . The “wing” region of syndapin 1 - F - BAR is bent away from its central body in a ~ 59° angle which generates a pronounced twisted S - shape in the dimeric molecule ( Figure 4 - 11 ) . The concave surface of syndapin 1 - F - BAR is less curved . To interact and satisfy membrane binding , the extreme degree of lateral wing kinking may help syndapins to bind and stabilize membranes with higher curvature or vesicular structure . 4 . 6 Crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 reveals an F - BAR - SH3 clamp Our own cell - based experiments ( Figure 4 - 1 ) together with recent data using purified syndapin incubated with liposomes ( Wang et al . , 2009a ) suggested that the membrane - tubulating activity of the F - BAR domain is autoinihibited by the SH3 domain . However , the molecular basis for this behavior is still unknown . To unravel the structural basis of autoinhibition , we solved the structure of full - length syndapin 1 by protein x - ray crystallography ( Figure 4 - 12 ) . We obtained two distinct crystal forms of full - length syndapin 1 ( Ful - 1 , Ful - 2 ) with different unit cell dimensions ( Table 1 ) , as confirmed by SDS / PAGE and mass spectrometry . Both Ful - 1 and Ful - 2 crystals contain one dimer and one monomer of the F - BAR domain in the asymmetric unit , similar to the crystals of the isolated F - BAR domain . In addition , we found extra electron density to fit SH3 domains ( 385 – 440 ) . These SH3 domains adopt a conventional β - barrel fold , with the prototype C - terminal β - strand retrograding to an extended coil ( Figure 4 - 12A and B ) . The RT - src loop and the N - src loop flank the putative PxxP - binding groove with conserved residues such as P434 , W420 , and Y393 in syndapin 1 lying at the bottom . In none of the full - length molecules was the linker connecting the F - BAR and SH3 domains visible , suggesting a high degree of flexibility in this region , in agreement with secondary - structure predictions . Surprisingly , electron density was found for only two SH3 domains in Ful - 1 and a single SH3 domain in Ful - 2 , indicating that physiological interactions can be interrupted by crystal - packing forces . Due to the long invisible linker , it was not possible to assign the SH3 domains to one of the F - BAR domains . Results 68 Figure 4 - 12 Structure of full - length syndapin 1 . ( A ) Secondary - structure representation of syndapin 1 . Protein coloration : orange , monomer A ; magenta , monomer B ; green , the SH3 domain . The SH3 domain may be associated with either chain A or chain B of the F - BAR domain , but the lacking electron density for the tether disallows a definite chain assignment . A second SH3 domain found in the asymmetric unit which interacts with the F - BAR domain in an irrelevant manner is not shown in the model . N and C termini , the secondary - structure assignment , and the wedge loop protruding from the long helical region are labeled only on monomer A . The undetermined loop in F - BAR is indicated by a dashed line . ( B ) Close - up view of the interface of the SH3 and F - BAR domains . β - Strands of the SH3 domain are labeled . Residues involved in the interaction are shown as a stick model . Polar contacts are presented as black dashed lines . ( C , D ) The protein surface is colored according to the electrostatic potential : red ( negative ) through white ( neutral ) to blue ( positive ) . The lower panel shows an open - up view of the surface charge distribution between F - BAR and SH3 . Residues mutated in functional studies are labeled . To identify possible physiological interactions between the F - BAR and SH3 domains , the packing of the SH3 domains against the F - BAR domain in the crystal was analyzed . Previous low - resolution data suggested that the SH3 domains of endophilin ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) and syndapin ( Wang et al . , 2009a ) are placed at or near their respective BAR domains , although the precise position could not be determined . Such an interaction was also found in our crystals ( Ful - 1 ) , where the Results 69 SH3 domain with its putative PxxP - binding groove contacts the positively charged concave face at the tip of the F - BAR domain ( Figure 4 - 12A and B ) , with a small buried solvent - accessible area of 460 Å 2 . Interestingly , the charge distribution in the SH3 domain is also uneven : negatively charged at the side of the peptide - binding groove and positively charged at the opposite side . Thus , a clear charge complement exists within and near the interface ( Figure 4 - 12C and D ) . Residues at the interface are mainly located in α 3 and α 4 of the F - BAR domain and the RT - src loop of the SH3 domain . They form an extended hydrogen - bonding and / or salt - bridge network ( Figure 4 - 12B and Table 2 ) , which is the major contributor to the interaction . In particular , K141 , K145 , and K148 from α 3 of the F - BAR domain intensively interact with Q396 , E397 , and E400 in the RT - src loop of the SH3 domain . Indeed , 145 KKMK 148 is a common basic motif found in several F - BAR and BAR domain proteins such as amphiphysin and endophilin ( Figue 4 - 13 ) . The interface also contains a small hydrophobic patch formed by aromatic side chains in the peptide - binding groove of the SH3 domain and by aliphatic side chains of the F - BAR domain . The F - BAR / SH3 interaction is mainly mediated by hydrogen bonds / salt bridges ( Table 2 ) , implying that the interaction is salt - and pH - sensitive . The small buried area indicates that the SH3 binds weakly to the F - BAR domain , which is consistent with the observation that SH3 domains generally associate with their binding partners with relatively low affinities ( Jia et al . , 2005 ) . However , “complex” formation between the F - BAR and SH3 domains would be significant in solution due to the high local concentration of the two domains within the dimer .

Modeling was done by local structural alignment for the basic stretches common in F - BAR and BAR domains . As for amphiphysin 1 , the BAR domain of PDB code 1URU was positioned by superposing the 132 KKKV 135 motif onto 145 KKMK 148 of the syndapin 1 F - BAR domain ; the SH3 domain of PDB code 1BB9 was superposed to the syndapin 1 SH3 domain . As for endophilin 1 , the BAR domain of PDB code 1X03 was positioned by superposing the 171 KKKR 174 motif onto 145 KKMK 148 of the syndapin F - BAR domain ; the SH3 domain of PDB code 3C0C was superposed to the syndapin 1 SH3 domain Table 2 Hydrogen bonds / salt bridges between SH3 and F - BAR domains SH3 domain ( Chain D ) Distance ( Å ) F - BAR domain ( Chain A ) Y391 [ OH ] 2 . 92 E204 [ OE2 ] D392 [ O ] 2 . 52 K205 [ NZ ] Q396 [ OE1 ] 2 . 94 K148 [ NZ ] E397 [ OE1 ] 2 . 88 K145 [ NZ ] E397 [ OE2 ] 2 . 93 K145 [ NZ ] E397 [ OE2 ] 3 . 14 K141 [ NZ ] E400 [ OE2 ] 2 . 79 K145 [ NZ ] E400 [ OE1 ] 3 . 52 K145 [ NZ ] D436 [ O ] 2 . 88 K208 [ NZ ] N436 [ ND2 ] 3 . 09 D212 [ OD1 ] Y437 [ OH ] 3 . 09 E149 [ OE1 ] The interaction between the SH3 and F - BAR domains of syndapin 1 was confirmed by direct binding experiments using GST - linker - SH3 or GST - SH3 and His 6 - F - BAR ( Figure 4 - 14A ) . Replacement of K145 , K146 , and K148 from α 3 of the F - BAR with glutamates completely abolished association with GST - SH3 ( Figure 4 - 15A ) . Conversely , mutation of the charged / hydrophilic residues D394R / E400R or Q396R / E397R within the RT loop of the SH3 domain also significantly impaired association with the F - BAR domain ( Figure 4 - 15B ) , thereby confirming the crystallographically determined interface . To test whether association between the SH3 and F - BAR domains affects membrane tubulation in cells , we cotransfected both domains in trans into Cos7 cells and analyzed these by live - cell spinning - disk confocal microscopy ( Figure 4 - 16 ) . Indeed , coexpression of wild - type ( WT ) Results 71 mCherry - tagged SH3 strongly impaired the ability of eGFP - F - BAR to generate membrane tubules , whereas SH3s carrying point mutations that interfere with F - BAR association were much less potent ( Figure 4 - 16 ) . All SH3 - mCherry chimeras were expressed at identical levels ( Figure 4 - 16K ) . Hence , the F - BAR and SH3 domains of syndapin 1 interact both in vitro and in living cells . Figure 4 - 14 Syndapin 1 F - BAR binds to its SH3 domain . GST - syndapin 1 SH3 ( 379 - 441 ) or GST - syndapin 1 - Δ F - BAR ( 340 - 441 ) bind to their F - BAR domain in vitro , whereas GST does not . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . Input , 15 % of the total amount of purified F - BAR used for the binding assay .

( B ) Mutations within the SH3 domain ( E400R , D394R , E400R ) and ( Q396R , E397R ) selectively Results 72 impair binding to the F - BAR domain . By contrast , mutation of the proline - rich motif binding site on SH3 ( P434L ) does not affect F - BAR association . Binding assays were done as described in materials and methods . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . Input , 15 % ( A ) or 10 % ( B ) of the total amount of purified F - BAR used for the binding assay . Figure 4 - 16 Co - expression of SH3 - mCherry impairs syndapin 1 - F - BAR - mediated tubule formation in living cells . Cos7 cells co - expressing eGFP - syndapin 1 - F - BAR and SH3 - mCherry or various mutants thereof were analyzed by live cell spinning disc confocal microscopy . Representative still images from at least three independent experiments are shown . F - BAR - mediated membrane tubulation is blocked by coexpressed SH3 wild - type ( A - C ) but not by F - BAR binding - defective D394R / E400R ( D - F ) or Q396R / E397R mutants ( G - I ) Scale bar , 10 μ m .

Given are the mean number of Results 73 tubules ( ±SE ) per cell ( n = 3 for each syndapin 1 variant ) averaged for at least 20 cells . ( K ) SH3 - mCherry fusion proteins are expressed at similar levels . Bars represent the mean SH3 - mCherry fluorescence intensity per μ m 2 ( mean ± SD ; n = 10 ) . Given that the F - BAR / SH3 interaction is mainly mediated by hydrogen bonds / salt bridges revealed by the crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 , the salt concentration should affect the syndapin 1 intramolecular interaction ( it could also be intermolecular interaction ) . To answer this question , different salt concentrations were used in vitro binding experiments . The amount of F - BAR protein bound to the SH3 domain dramatically decreased when the salt concentration was increased from 50mM to 400mM NaCl ( Figure 4 - 17A and C ) . At 200mM NaCl , the amount of protein bound to SH3 was hardly detectable . Since SH3 domains normally recognize the proline - rich motifs , we wanted to test whether the interaction between the SH3 domain and proline - rich proteins is also affected by salt . To test this , we performed affinity - chromatography experiments using purified dynamin 1 - PRD , a fragment of dynamin 1 containing the GED and PH domain as well as a proline - rich segment at their C - terminus . As shown in Figure 4 - 17 , dynamin 1 - PRD bound to SH3 even at 400mM NaCl ( Figure 4 - 17B and C ) , implying that the association with dynamin 1 or proteins with PRD domains may unlock the syndapin 1 F - BAR from the SH3 clamp . Under physiological conditions , the intracellular concentration of NaCl is about 150mM , suggesting that the syndapin 1 intramolecular interaction is weak , but potentially biologically significant . Figure 4 - 17 Complex formation between syndapin 1 F - BAR and SH3 is salt - sensitive . GST - syndapin 1 SH3 ( 379 – 441 ) or GST ( as a negative control ) were incubated with purified Results 74 F - BAR ( A ) or the proline - rich domain of dynamin 1 ( PRD ) ( B ) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of NaCl . The relative fraction of bound PRD or F - BAR is plotted as a function of salt concentration ( C ) . The amount of either protein specifically bound to GST - SH3 in the presence of 50 mM NaCl was set to 1 . To further assess the specificity of SH3 - BAR / F - BAR domain interactions , we analyzed the behavior of the endocytic N - BAR - SH3 domain proteins endophilin 1 and amphiphysin 1 . Molecular modeling suggests the existence of a basic patch on the N - BAR domains of endophilin 1 and amphiphysin 1 ( Figure 4 - 13 ) that could serve as a docking site for SH3 domains , in agreement with recent low - resolution small - angle X - ray scattering data ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . To address this possibility , we performed affinity - chromatography experiments using endophilin 1 SH3 or amphiphysin 1 SH3 fused to GST and purified recombinant BAR domains . Both endophilin 1 SH3 ( Figure 4 - 18A ) and amphiphysin 1 SH3 ( Figure 4 - 18B ) bound to their corresponding BAR domains . Interactions between BAR and SH3 domains were also specific to some degree . When offered to different endocytic SH3 domains , syndapin 1 F - BAR preferentially associated with its own SH3 domain , whereas weaker interactions were observed between syndapin 1 F - BAR and amphiphysin 1 SH3 and endophilin 1 SH3 ( Figure 4 - 18C ) . Figure 4 - 18 The interaction between BAR domain and SH3 domain . In vitro binding assays , GST or GST - SH3 fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with Results 75 purified His 6 - tagged endophilin 1 - BAR ( A ) , amphiphysin 1 - BAR ( B ) , or syndapin 1 - F - BAR ( C ) domains . Input , 5 % ( A , B ) or 3 . 5 % ( C ) of the total amount of purified BAR domains used for the assay . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . This experiment was performed by Dr . Arndt Pechstein . Collectively , the experiments described above suggest that the membrane - tubulating activity of syndapin 1 is under regulatory control by its SH3 domain . The fact that the SH3 contacts the F - BAR domain via its putative PxxP - binding groove further suggests a role for proline - rich SH3 ligands such as dynamin 1 or N - WASP in regulating F - BAR - mediated membrane tubulation . We further explored this putative functional partnership between syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 directly . Figure 4 - 19 The PxxP motif peptide and syndapin 1 F - BAR partially overlapping binding sites on syndapin 1 - SH3 . ( A ) Close - up view of the interface of the SH3 and F - BAR domains as shown in Figure 4 - 12B . ( B ) A proline - rich peptide ( blue ) is modeled by hand to the putative PxxP - binding groove in the syndapin 1 SH3 domain , corresponding to the peptide position in the SH3 - peptide complex structures PDB ID codes 1W70 and 2DRK . 4 . 7 Association of syndapin 1 with dynamin 1 unlocks its latent membrane tubulating activity The crystallographic data suggest that dynamin may compete with the F - BAR domain to unlock the syndapin 1 F - BAR - SH3 clamp . Actually , an overlapping surface on the RT loop of SH3 domain is found when superimposing syndapin 1 - SH3 domain with SH3 - peptide complex structures ( PDB ID codes 1W70 and 2DRK ) ( Figure 4 - 19 ) . To comfirm our structure analysis , purified dynamin 1 - PRD was applied to wild - type syndapin 1 - SH3 domain or mutants . As a control , mutant P434L in the SH3 domain indeed eliminates the association with dynamin but not Results 76 syndapin 1 - F - BAR ( Figure 4 - 15B and 4 - 20A ) . Mutations E400R and D394R / E400R not only impair SH3 association with syndapin 1 - F - BAR but also with the proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin 1 ( Figure 4 - 15B and 4 - 20A ) . By contrast , SH3 Q396R / E397R maintains the ability to bind to dynamin 1 - PRD , although it fails to associate with the F - BAR ( Figure 4 - 15B and 4 - 20A ) . Hence , dynamin 1 and F - BAR use an overlapping , yet , partially distinct interaction surface on the RT loop of the syndapin 1 SH3 domain for binding . This conclusion is further substantiated by peptide competition in direct binding assays . F - BAR domain binding to GST - SH3 is potently inhibited by a dynamin 1 - derived proline - rich peptide ( PxxP ) ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ) , whereas mutant ( AxxA ) or unrelated control peptides are inactive ( Figure 4 - 20B ) . Figure 4 - 20 Association of syndapin 1 - SH3 with dynamin 1 PRD domain or dynamin 1 - derived peptide . ( A ) The proline - rich domain of dynamin 1 ( Dyn I - PRD ) and syndapin 1 F - BAR compete for partially overlapping binding sites on syndapin 1 - SH3 . GST pulldowns assays were performed as described in materials and methods . ( B ) A dynamin 1 - derived syndapin 1 - binding wild - type ( PxxP ) but not an inactive mutant ( AxxA ) peptide competes with F - BAR for binding to GST - SH3 . A peptide derived from the syndapin 1 linker region ( NPF ) was taken as a further negative control . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue . Input , 15 % ( A , B ) of the total amount of purified F - BAR domain used in the assay . If indeed association of SH3 with proline - rich ligands releases the F - BAR from the SH3 clamp , addition of a dynamin 1 - derived PRD peptide should potently stimulate Results 77 syndapin 1 - mediated membrane sculpting . We tested this idea using purified syndapin 1 incubated with liposomes in vitro . As expected from our cellular studies syndapin 1 avidly bound to liposomes ( Figure 4 - 21E ) but did not cause significant tubulation like syndapin F - BAR ( Figure 4 - 21A , B and F ) . However , a potent syndapin 1 - dependent membrane deformation activity was released upon addition of the dynamin 1 PRD peptide ( Figure4 - 21C and F ) . The dynamin 1 - PRD peptide did not alter liposomal membrane association of syndapin 1 ( Figure 4 - 21E ) nor did it cause membrane tubulation on its own . Similarly , breaking the F - BAR - SH3 clamp by mutation ( Q396R / E397R ) also unleashed the membrane sculpting activity of syndapin 1 on liposomes ( Figure 4 - 21D and F ) . These results suggest syndapin 1 functionally cooperates with PRD ligands , most notably dynamin 1 , in driving membrane deformation and fission .

Purified full - length wild - type ( WT ) syndapin 1 was incubated with PS - containing liposomes in the presence or absence of the dynamin 1 - derived PRD peptide .

Shown are the mean number of tubules ( ± S . E . ) per cell ( n = 3 for each syndapin 1 variant ) averaged for at least 20 cells . To test such a hypothetical scenario , eGFP - syndapin 1 was co - expressed with either WT or GTP - locked ( K44A ) dynamin 1 - mRFP . As a control , excessive tubulation occured in Cos7 cells when co - expressing dynamin 1 ( K44A ) - mRFP with the wedge loop mutant eGFP - syndapin 1 ( I122F / M123F ) which enhances tubulation even in syndapin full - length constructs ( Figure 4 - 10A and Figure 4 - 22A - B and F - H ) , whereas membrane tubules are consumed by co - expression of dynamin 1 - ( WT ) - mRFP ( Figure 4 - 22B - E ) . Similarly , confocal live cell imaging revealed numerous syndapin 1 - and dynamin 1 - positive membrane tubules in cells co - expressing eGFP - syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 ( K44A ) - mRFP . Much fewer and shorter tubules were observed in dynamin 1 ( WT ) - mRFP transfected cells , which instead accumulated membrane - bound vesicles ( Figure 4 - 23A - F and L ) . Membrane tubulation was not observed in cells co - expressing dynamin 1 ( K44A ) - mRFP together with eGFP - syndapin 1 ( K127E / K130E ) ( Figure 4 - 23G - I and L ) , a variant carrying point mutations within the F - BAR domain that abrogate tubulation ( Figure 4 - 10C ) , but do not impair association with either its SH3 domain or with dynamin 1 . Tubules were absent from cells expressing dynamin 1 ( K44A ) - mRFP ( Figure 4 - 23K ) or eGFP - syndapin 1 alone ( Figure 4 - 1B ) . Collectively , we conclude that dynamin 1 is able to release the F - BAR domain of syndapin 1 from SH3 domain - mediated autoinhibition , thereby uncovering its latent membrane - deforming activity . Thus , syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 appear to undergo a functional partnership in driving membrane remodelling during endocytosis . Discussion 81 5 Discussion 5 . 1 Crystallization of full - length syndapin 1 Similar to other BAR domain containing - proteins , syndapin 1 contains an N - terminal F - BAR domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain which are connected by an ~ 80aa long flexible linker . So far , several groups tried to obtain the crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 as shown in Table 3 , but failed . Instead structures of the degraded F - BAR domain were obtained . In this study , we obtained crystals of full - length syndapin 1 which were confirmed by SDS - PAGE and mass spectrometry . As shown in Table 3 , HEPES or Tris - HCl buffer at ~ pH 7 . 4 was generally used as protein sample buffer while pH conditions were different in crystallization conditions . Our crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 revealed that syndapin 1 - SH3 domain binds to its F - BAR domain and froms an autoinhibitory comformation . The intramolecular interaction of syndapin 1 is pH - and salt - sensitive . Increasing the salt concentration dissociated the interaction of the SH3 domain and F - BAR domain . Likewise , high pH will also disrupt syndapins intramolecular interaction thus leading to the open conformation state . Other groups ( Table 3 ) commonly used more than 150mM NaCl ( at physiological conditions ) . According to our data , the F - BAR domain does not bind to the SH3 domain under these conditions . Although 200mM NaCl was also used as protein sample buffer in this study , this was diluted to 100mM NaCl when mixed with the salt - free reservoir solution at which the F - BAR domain of syndapin maintains association with the SH3 domain ( Figure 4 - 17A ) . Additionally , pH 5 . 0 was used for crystallization in this study . A low pH may stabilize the interaction between the SH3 domain and the F - BAR and inhibit degradation . The crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 was successfully determined in this study and revealed a clamped conformation resulting from an interaction between its SH3 domain and its F - BAR domain . A somewhat puzzling observation was that the SH3 domains appear to bind different regions of F - BAR domains in the two crystal structures obtained . How can this be explained ? First , the interaction between the SH3 and F - BAR domains is comparably weak . It relies on salt - sensitive electrostatic interactions . High salt concentrations in the crystallization assay may dissociate the Discussion 82 SH3 from the F - BAR domain . In addition , the syndapin 1 F - BAR domain can assemble into tubules , indicating a noticeable attraction between F - BAR domains . At high concentration of syndapin 1 - F - BAR domain occurring in the crystallization drop , this intermolecular interaction between F - BAR domains may compete with the intra - molecular SH3 / F - BAR interaction . Finally , SH3 domain positions can be deteriorated by crystal packing forces . Table 3 Crystallization Conditions of Syndapins / Pacsins 5 . 2 Formation of membrane tubules and protrusions in cells overexpressing syndapin 1 - F - BAR domain BAR domain superfamily proteins play a fundamental role in shaping membranes during diverse cellular processes ( Frost et al . , 2009 ) ranging from the formation of endocytic vesicles ( Clayton et al . , 2009 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Qualmann and Kessels , 2002 ; Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ; Wieffer et al . , 2009 ) and T - tubules in muscle ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Rikhy et al . , 2002 ) , to cell migration and morphogenesis ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ; Edeling et al . , 2009 ; Guerrier et al . , 2009 ) . Previous studies have allowed us a glimpse at the molecular mechanisms by which BAR / F - BAR domain proteins drive membrane sculpting ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) or sense and stabilize curved membrane domains ( Bhatia et al . , 2009 ; Protein sample buffer Crystal conditions PDB ID Buffer Salt Precipitant Salt pH Reference 3LLL 20mM HEPES pH7 . 4 - - - 4 – 5 % PEG - MM E 550 1 . 6 – 1 . 7 M ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 0 . 1 M HEPES pH 7 . 5 ( Plomann et al . , 2010 ) 3I2W 10mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 0 . 2 M NaCl 17 % PEG 3350 , 0 . 1 M Na2HPO 4 ( Edeling et al . , 2009 ) 3HAI 25mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 0 . 4 M NaCl 18 % PEG33501 % Tryptone - - - 0 . 1 M HEPES pH 7 . 0 ( Wang et al . , 2009a ) 3HAJ 25mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 0 . 4 M NaCl 20 % PEG - MM E 5000 - - - 0 . 1 M Bis - Tris pH 6 . 5 ( Wang et al . , 2009a ) 2X3W 50mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 0 . 2 M NaCl 4 % PEG4000 - - - 0 . 1 M NaAc pH 5 . 0 ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) - - 10mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 0 . 5 M NaCl 20 % PEG 3350 - - - 0 . 2 m M NH 4 H 2 PO 4 pH 7 . 9 ( Bai et al . , 2010 ) Discussion 83 Hatzakis et al . , 2009 ) . Here we studied the F - BAR containing - protein syndapin I which is mainly restricted to the ( adult ) brain and accumulates in synaptic compartments ( Plomann et al . , 1998 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) . Similar to other BAR or F - BAR containing - proteins , the syndapin 1 - F - BAR domain produces membrane tubules in living Cos7 cells and generates tubules when incubated with liposomes . Unlike other BAR or F - BAR contaning - proteins , which produce membrane tubules from the plasma membrane upon overexpression in cells ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) , most of the membrane tubules generated by syndapin 1 - F - BAR are of endosomal origin ( Figure 4 - 2 ) . Although syndapin 1 has been linked to vesicle formation at the plasma membrane via cooperation of its F - BAR and SH3 domains , it is possible that syndapin 1 also functions in endosomal compartments . Previous studies have shows that syndapin 1 directly interacts with EHD proteins , which function in the exit of receptors and other membrane proteins from the endosomal recycling compartment . This interaction involves syndapin’s two NPF motifs residing in the linker between the F - BAR and SH3 domains ( Braun et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests that syndapin 1 may play a role in endosomal recycling . Compared with other BAR / F - BAR domains , the F - BAR domain of syndapin 1 has an additional “wedge loop” consisting of 119 HKQIMGGF 126 with hydrophobic residues ( I122 - M123 ) at the tip . Mutation of I122T / M123Q blocks F - BAR’s membrane tubulation ability while mutation I122F / M123F leading to the incorporation of a bulkier hydrophobic residue , significantly increases the membrane tubulation ability . This suggests that the wedge loop is necessary for membrane binding and probably for membrane insertion . Interestingly , mutation of I122F / M123F enables full length syndapin 1 to generate numerous membrane tubules in living cells , which does not occur in wild type syndapin 1 . Some of these membrane tubules originated from the plasma membrane ( Figure 4 - 22 ) . Strikingly , membrane protrusions ( or filopodia ) were also found after overexpression of syndapin 1 - F - BAR in living Cos7 cells ( Figure 4 - 3 ) . This phenomenon was likewise observed in the case of the F - BAR containing - protein srGAP2 . The membrane protrusions formed by the srGAP2 F - BAR domain negatively regulate neuronal migration and induce neurite outgrowth and branching ( Guerrier et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , membrane protrusions are normally found in cells expressing Discussion 84 I - BAR containing proteins , like IRSp53 , but not BAR / F - BAR family members . Filopodia are often found embedded in or protruding from the lamellipodial actin network ( Small and Celis , 1978 ; Svitkina et al . , 2003 ) and play an important role in neurite outgrowth , wound healing and cell migration , and function as precursors for dendritic spines in neurons ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ) . In neurons , growth cones contain a large number of filopodia to guide axons and dendrites to their proper targets ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ) . Syndapin 1 not only accumulates in the synaptic compartment but also localizes at neuronal growth cones ( Braun et al . , 2005 ) . The fact that syndapin 1 has the ability to induce membrane protrusions or filopodia suggests that syndapin 1 plays a role in neurite outgrowth . Neurite number and dendrite branching were highly increased in neurons overexpressing syndapin 1 ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . Transfecting a syndapin mutant lacking the SH3 domain did not show increased number of neurites or dendrite branches ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . The crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 reveals the autoinhibitory conformation . To carry out membrane targeting and then induce membrane deformation by its F - BAR domain , the autoinhibitory conformation of syndapin 1 has to be unlocked . Given that the influence of syndapin 1 on neuronal morphology depends on N - WASP ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) , the interaction with N - WASP may also unlock the autoinhibitory conformation of syndapin , similar to dynamin 1 . Interestingly , knockdown of syndapin 1 leads to aberrant axon branching and impaired axon development ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . How syndapin 1 regulates neuronal morphology and neuron development remains to be understood in detail . How does syndapin 1 F - BAR domain induce the formation of filopodia ? Generally , the formation of filopodia is dependent on proteins that regulate actin polymerization at the barbed end of actin filaments and on actin factors ( Gupton and Gertler , 2007 ) . One may ask whether the syndapin 1 - F - BAR domain relies on the same mechanism used by I - BAR domains to induce filopodia formation ( Figure 1 - 14 ) ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Unlike the BAR / F - BAR domain , the dimerization of the I - BAR domain generates negative curvature and induces the formation of dynamic membrane protrusions opposite to those seen in syndapin 1 F - BAR expressing cells . Filopodia formation by I - BAR domains depends on the inherent negative curvature of the I - BAR domain and on phopholipid - binding Discussion 85 residues on the convex side of the I - BAR homodimers ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , Eps8 functions as an regulatory protein for I - BAR domain containing - proteins to regulate filopodia formation by blocking addition of actin at the barbed ends of actin filaments ( Figure 1 - 14C , D ) ( Disanza et al . , 2004 ; Higgs , 2004 ) . By contrast , F - BAR domains induce and stabilize positive membrane curvature , impying that the mechanism of filopodia formation by the F - BAR domain must be different from that used by the I - BAR domain . Another F - BAR family protein PSTPIP 2 is able to directly associate with F - actin and induce filopodia formation ( Chitu et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that syndapin 1 may use a similar mechanism to induce filopodia formation . Collectively , our data suggests that syndapin 1 - F - BAR can generate both positive curvature ( membrane tubules in this study ) and membrane protrusions . Whereas the positive curvature generated by syndapin 1 is used for vesicle formation in case of other BAR containing proteins , the ability to generate membrane protrusions regulates neuronal morphology and development . Syndapin - induced neuronal arborization is N - WASP - and Cdc42 - dependent . Deletion of syndapin 1 impaires axon development and especially phenocopies the aberrant axon branching observed upon N - WASP or Arp2 / 3 complex deficiency ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that N - WASP and Cdc42 are linked to syndapin 1 - induced filopodia formation . However , additional work is required to understand how syndapin may direct membrane protrusions of opposite curvature in living cells and perhaps in vitro . 5 . 3 Dynamins unlock the autoinhibitory conformation of BAR domain containing - proteins Unlike syndapin 1 - F - BAR , syndapin 1 does not induce membrane tubulation in living Cos7 cells . The crystal structure of full - length syndapin 1 reveals that its F - BAR domain is autoinhibited by its SH3 domain . The interaction between the F - BAR domain and the SH3 domain is mainly mediated by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges . Do BAR - SH3 proteins , such as endophilin and amphiphysin , have a similar autoinhibited conformation ? Based on the crystal structures of their BAR domains , Discussion 86 endophilin and amphiphysin contain motifs ( “KKKV” in amphiphysin BAR domain and “KKKR” in endophilin BAR domain ) similar to the basic stretch found in syndapin 1 - F - BAR domain ( “KKMK” motif ) ( Figure 4 - 13 ) . Mutagenesis data confirm the importance of these residues for binding to syndapin 1 SH3 domain in in vitro binding assays ( Figure 4 - 15 ) . Previous low - resolution data have shown that the SH3 domain of endophilin is localized at or near its respective BAR domain ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . Our data confirm that both amphiphysin and endophilin SH3 domains can each bind to their own BAR domains ( Figure 4 - 18 ) . Interestingly , other groups have shown that both endophilin and amphiphysin were able to form autoinhibitory conformations , involving their SH3 domains and a proline - rich motif localized between BAR and SH3 domains ( Chen et al . , 2003 ; Farsad et al . , 2003 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . More experiments are needed to determine whether endophilin and / or amphiphysin are autoinhibited in a manner similar to that seen for syndapin and how release form such autoinhibition migh be regulated Strikely , mutating residues involved in the binding of the SH3 domain rescue the membrane tubulation ability of syndapin 1 in liposome tubulation assays ( Figue 4 - 21D ) . However , the binding affinity between the two domains appears comparably weak . Owing to the charge surface of the F - BAR domain , which makes the F - BAR domain couple to sensor chip CM5 , it is difficult to obtain the KD value using Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR ) technique . A weak intramolecular interaction most likely is physiologically important , because the interaction between the SH3 domain and its physiological binding partners dynamin 1 and N - WASP is weak as well , yet , is required to release syndapin from the locked conformation . Indeed , we have shown that the SH3 clamp on F - BAR is released by complex formation between the syndapin 1 - SH3 domain and its physiological binding partner dynamin 1 ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ; Clayton et al . , 2009 ; Qualmann and Kessels , 2002 ) , suggesting a further mechanistic link between F - BAR domain mediated membrane deformation and the fission process . Our peptide competition and in vitro liposome tubulation assays show that a dynamin 1 - derived peptide is able to release F - BAR / SH3 from autoinhibition . Syndapin 1 , similar to other BAR - SH3 domain proteins , has been postulated to aid membrane recruitment of dynamin 1 within stimulated nerve terminals ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ) . Although association of the syndapin 1 - F - BAR and SH3 domains suppresses its membrane deforming activity , Discussion 87 phospholipid binding remains largely unaffected . Figure 5 - 1 Hypothetical model for the cooperative role of BAR - SH3 domain - containing proteins and dynamin 1 in membrane deformation and fission . The positive charge surface of BAR / F - BAR domain is indicated by “ + ” . The autoinhibition of BAR domain containing - proteins is shown in the “close” state , whereas the “open” state is released by the PxxP motif containing - protein dynamin 1 . The recruitment of BAR domain to plasma membrane together with dynamin generates membrane deformation and fission . In a hypothetical scenario , syndapin 1 dimers ( or more general BAR domain containing - proteins with a C - terminal SH3 domain ) undergo labile association with membranes . The capture of dynamin 1 via PRD - SH3 interactions drives several changes . By displacing the SH3 domain from the F - BAR domain dynamin 1 facilitates a conformational change within syndapin 1 to the open conformation , thereby releasing the F - BAR domain from geometrical constraints ( Figure 5 - 1 ) . Self - assembly of dynamin 1 in turn possibly stabilizes syndapin 1 in its membrane - bound state . Reorganization of syndapin 1 - F - BAR into a helically arranged lattice , as recently shown for the structurally related proteins CIP4 and FBP17 ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) , then serves as a trigger for membrane sculpting , a process further aided by dynamin 1 co - assembly ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 5 - 1 ) . Such locally deformed bilayers are then subject to dynamin GTPase - driven fission . It is possible that syndapin 1 directly contributes to this , e . g . by insertion of the amphipathic wedge loop into one leaflet of the deformed membrane and by stimulating dynamin ' s GTPase activity . Similar regulatory Discussion 88 principles may apply to the role of amphiphysin ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) and endophilin ( Koh et al . , 2004 ; Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) during the fissioning of late stage clathrin - coated pits by dynamin during endocytosis or SV recycling , although additional experimental data are required to test this . Such a model is consistent not only with the data presented here but also with earlier studies ( Farsad and De Camilli , 2003 ) . Furthermore , a molecularly distinct autoinhibitory mechanism involving the BAR and GAP domains has recently been proposed for members of the GRAF family ( GRAF : GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase ) ( Eberth et al . , 2009 ) . GRAF , a tumour - suppressor gene of acute myelogenous leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome shares an N - terminal BAR domain , followed by a PH domain and a RhoGAP - related domain ( Borkhardt et al . , 2000 ; Eberth et al . , 2009 ) . It was shown that the N - terminal BAR domain directly associates with the corresponding GAP domain thereby blocking its activity ( Eberth et al . , 2009 ) . SH3 - mediated control of BAR / F - BAR domain function may not only be of relevance to endocytic vesicle formation but could be of more general importance . Syndapin family members also are crucial regulators of notochord development ( Edeling et al . , 2009 ) and neuromorphogenesis by linking membrane sculpting to N - WASP - dependent actin polymerization ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . We predict that N - WASP binding to syndapin 1 - SH3 ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 ) will cause conformational changes similar to those elicited by association of dynamin . Interestingly , during neuromorphogenesis syndapin 1 may release N - WASP from autoinhibition ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . In fact , both the SH3 domain and the F - BAR domain of syndapin 1 are required for regulating neuronal morphology and development ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . . Hence , syndapin 1 action during actin - dependent remodelling of the neuronal plasma membrane and bulk endocytosis ( Clayton et al . , 2009 ) may follow similar regulatory principles . 5 . 4 The role of syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 in bulk endocytosis of SV membranes In nerve terminals , only a limited supply of synaptic vesicles is available . These synaptic vesicles have to be quickly and reliably recycled to maintain neurotransmitter release , which is particularly important during elevated neuronal activity . However , the dominant recycling pathway , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , Discussion 89 has a limited capacity . Likewise , owing to the size of a synapse , the region of plasma membrane used for vesicle formation is limited . Bulk endocytosis is an alternative pathway which provides a fast and high capacity retrieval of synaptic vesicles by invaginating large regions of plasma membrane ( hereafter referred to as “endosome - like structures” ) from which synaptic vesicles can bud . Activity - dependent bulk endocytosis has been postulated to provide additional synaptic vesicles to maintain the reserve pool ( Cheung et al . , 2010 ) . Studies of dynamin 1 - knockout neurons show that dynamin 1 is specifically required for synaptic vesicle recycling during intense neuronal activity ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) . Activity - dependent bulk endocytosis but not clathrin - mediated endocytosis is blocked if the interaction between dynamin 1 and syndapin 1 is perturbed ( Clayton et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , only the interaction between syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 is specifically regulated by dynamin 1 dephosphorylation which occurs during intense neuronal activity ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ; Cousin and Robinson , 2001 ; Cousin et al . , 2001 ) , implying that syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 function together in bulk endocytosis . In this study , we have shown that the autoinhibition of syndapin 1 can be unlocked by dynamin 1 , but the precise function of syndapin 1 and dynamin 1 for bulk endocytosis still remains to be determined in detail . It has been observed that in lamprey reticulospinal synapses perturbation of syndapin function by antibody under intense stimulation conditions massively increases membranous cisternae decorated by CCPs and invaginations around release sites , but not of coated pits at the plasma membrane ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . These data suggest that syndapin 1 may stabilize the plasma membrane to facilitate bulk endocytosis during elevated neuronal activity , but not to generate endosome - like structures . Interestingly , when the purified syndapin F - BAR is incubated with liposomes , it not only generates tubular structures but also abundant small vesicles ( d = 35 ± 5 nm ) which often appear to be connected and clustered together , similar to beads on a string ( Wang et al . , 2009a ) , The tubular structures are of two classes : those with shallow curvature ( d = 53 ± 18 nm ) and others , which appear as striated ( d = 98 ± 34 nm ) tubules of high curvature with a mean diameter of 17 ± 3 nm ( Wang et al . , 2009a ) . Collectively , these data imply that syndapin 1 is able to shape and bind to both low and high curvature membranes . Why is syndapin able to stabilize high membrane curvature ? Based on our crystal structure , the F - BAR domain of syndapin Discussion 90 1 has two distinct features ( i ) an amphipathic “wedge loop” consisting of 119 HKQIMGGF 126 with hydrophobic residues ( I122 - M123 ) which are necessary for F - BAR’s membrane tubulation ability and ( ii ) a highly kinked lateral “wing” region . This special lateral “wing” region and the insertion of the amphipathtic wedge loop into the plasma membrane may lower the energy threshold for syndapin to stabilize high membrane curvature . Given that syndapin can generate and bind both low and high membrane curvature , the question how syndapin utilizes these features to facilitate bulk endocytosis awaits further elucidation . Conclusion and Outlook 91 6 Conclusion and Outlook Syndapin 1 , a synaptically enriched protein , is comprised of an N - terminal F - BAR linked to a C - terminal dynamin - binding SH3 domain via a long flexible tether containing two NPF motifs . It has to be been linked to bulk endocytosis pathway together with another synaptically enriched protein dynamin 1 . Bulk endocytosis has been postulated to provide a fast and high capacity retrieval of synaptic vesicles by invaginating large regions of plasma membrane from which synaptic vesicles can bud . In this study , we solved the crystal structures of syndapin 1 - F - BAR and full - length syndapin 1 . These crystal structures show that the syndapin 1 F - BAR domain , in contrast to other BAR / F - BAR domains , contains a wedge loop consisting of 119 HKQIMGGF 126 with hydrophobic residues ( I122 - M123 ) at the tip . This wedge loop is required for syndapin´s membrane - deforming activity . Additionally , a highly kinked lateral “wing” region in syndapin is observed in the crystal structure of syndapin 1 . It suggests that syndapin 1 may utilize these features to facilitate bulk endocytosis by invaginating large regions of plasma membrane . Mutation of these regions may block the activity of syndapin in bulk endocytosis . However , the precise mechanism still remains to be understood . Similar to other BAR / F - BAR domains , the F - BAR domain of syndapin also generated membrane tubules in living cells and tubulated liposomes in vitro . Interestingly , membrane protrusions were detected when overexpressing the syndapin F - BAR domain in living cells . Similar to other F - BAR domain containing - proteins , such as srGAP via induction of filopodia - like membrane protrusions , syndapin 1 may regulate neuronal morphogenesis . Recent studies have linked syndapin 1 to neuronal morphogenesis together with its binding partner N - WASP . Syndapin 1 appears to release N - WASP from autoinhibition . But how syndapin 1 regulates neuronal morphogenesis still awaits further elucidation . We show that the membrane - deforming activity of syndapin 1 is autoinhibited by its SH3 domain . Crystallographic analysis reveals an interaction surface composed of a basic patch on the F - BAR domain that interacts with a corresponding acidic surface on the PRD - binding RT loop of the SH3 domian . Such charge complementarity is also used for binding by PxxP motifs within SH3 domain ligands including dynamin Conclusion and Outlook 92 1 . Release from the clamped conformation is driven by association of syndapin 1 - SH3 with the proline - rich domain of dynamin 1 , thereby unlocking its potent membrane deforming - activity . In vitro , we show that BAR - SH3 proteins , endophilin and amphipysin also form intramolecular interaction . We hypothesize that this mechanism might be commonly used to regulate BAR / F - BAR domain - mediated membrane sculpting and to potentially couple this process to dynamin - mediated fission . The crystal structures of full - length BAR - SH3 proteins , such as endophilin and amphiphysin , may provide more evidence to support this model . It will be also interesting to test whether other proteins with proline - rich regions , such as N - WASP , display a similar ability as dynamin 1 to unlock the autoinhibitory conformation of BAR - SH3 proteins . In summary , we predict that SH3 - domain mediated autoregulation of the membrane - deforming activity of BAR / F - BAR domains is of crucial importance for the function of syndapin 1 and perhaps other BAR domain proteins .
