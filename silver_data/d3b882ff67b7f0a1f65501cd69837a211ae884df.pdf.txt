Nature GeNetics aDVaNCE ONLINE PUBLICaTION  Evidence for the etiology of autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) has consistently pointed to a strong genetic component complicated by substantial locus heterogeneity  , 2 . We sequenced the exomes of 20 individuals with sporadic ASD ( cases ) and their parents , reasoning that these families would be enriched for de novo mutations of major effect . We identified 2 de novo mutations ,  of which were protein altering . Protein - altering mutations were significantly enriched for changes at highly conserved residues . We identified potentially causative de novo events in 4 out of 20 probands , particularly among more severely affected individuals , in FOXP1 , GRIN2B , SCN1A and LAMC3 . In the FOXP1 mutation carrier , we also observed a rare inherited CNTNAP2 missense variant , and we provide functional support for a multi - hit model for disease risk 3 . Our results show that trio - based exome sequencing is a powerful approach for identifying new candidate genes for ASDs and suggest that de novo mutations may contribute substantially to the genetic etiology of ASDs . ASDs are characterized by pervasive impairment in language , com­ munication and social reciprocity and restricted interests or stereo­ typed behaviors 1 . Several new candidate loci for ASDs have recently been identified using genome­wide approaches that discover indi­ vidually rare events of major effect 2 . A number of genetic syndromes with features of the ASD phenotype , collectively referred to as syn­ dromic autism , have also been described 4 . Despite this progress , the genetic basis for the vast majority of cases remains unknown . Several observations support the hypothesis that the genetic basis for ASDs in sporadic cases may differ from that of families with multiple affected individuals , with the former being more likely to result from de novo mutation events rather than inherited variants 1 , 5 – 7 . In this study , we sequenced the protein­coding regions of the genome ( the exome ) 8 to test the hypothesis that de novo protein­altering muta­ tions contribute substantially to the genetic basis of sporadic ASDs . In contrast with array­based analysis of large de novo copy number variants ( CNVs ) , this approach has greater potential to implicate single genes in ASDs . We selected 20 trios with an idiopathic ASD , each consistent with a sporadic ASD based on clinical evaluations ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , pedigree structure , familial phenotypic evaluation , family history and / or elevated parental age . Each family was initially screened by array comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) using a customized microarray 9 . We identified no large ( > 250 kb ) de novo CNVs but did identify a maternally inherited deletion ( ~ 350 kb ) at 15q11 . 2 in one family ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This deletion has been associated with increased risk for epilepsy 10 and schizophrenia 11 , 12 but has not been considered causal for autism . Similar to researchers from a previous study 13 , who reported exome sequencing on ten parent­child trios with sporadic cases of moder­ ate to severe intellectual disability , we performed exome sequencing on each of the 60 individuals separately by subjecting whole­blood derived genomic DNA to in­solution hybrid capture and Illumina sequencing ( Online Methods ) . We obtained sufficient coverage to call variants for ~ 90 % of the primary target ( 26 . 4 Mb ) ( Table 1 ) . Genotype concordance with SNP microarray data was high ( 99 . 7 % ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) , and on average , 96 % of proband variant sites were also called in both parents ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Given the expected rarity of true de novo events in the targeted exome ( < 1 per trio ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) 14 , we reasoned that most apparently de novo variants would result from under calling in parents or sys­ tematic false positive calls in the proband . We therefore filtered vari­ ants previously observed in the dbSNP database , 1000 Genomes Pilot Project data 15 and 1 , 490 other exomes sequenced at the University of Washington ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We performed Sanger sequenc­ ing on the remaining de novo candidates ( < 5 per trio ) , validating 18 events within coding sequence and three additional events mapping to 3 ′ untranslated regions ( Table 2 ) . A list of predicted variant sites within these genes from the 1000 Genomes Pilot Project data 15 is provided for comparison ( Supplementary Table 5 ) .

The overall protein­coding de novo rate ( 0 . 9 events per trio ) was slightly higher than expected 14 ( 0 . 59 events per trio ) , suggesting that we identified the majority of the de novo events in these trios ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . The transition to transver­ sion ratio was highly skewed ( 18 : 2 ) , with eight transitions mapping to hypermutable CpG dinucleotides 14 . The proportion of synonymous events was higher than expected based on a neutral model and may reflect selection against embryonic lethal non­synonymous variants . We successfully determined the parent of origin for seven events , six of which occurred on the paternal haplotype ( Table 2 ) . Notably , the eight probands with two or more validated de novo events cor­ responded to families with higher parental age ( Mann­Whitney U , combined age , one­sided P < 0 . 004 ) . Eleven of the 18 coding de novo events are predicted to alter pro­ tein function . Each of these mutations occurred in a different gene , precluding a statistical assessment for any specific locus despite their deleterious nature ( for example , using PolyPhen­2 ) 16 . We assessed whether proband de novo mutations were enriched in the aggregate for disruptive events by considering two independent quantitative measures : the nature of the amino­acid replacement ( Grantham matrix score 17 ) and the degree of nucleotide­level evolutionary conservation ( Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling ( GERP ) 18 , 19 ) ( Fig . 1a , b ) . For comparison , we sequenced 20 exomes from unrelated ethnically matched controls ( from HapMap ) and applied the same filters to identify coding­sequence mutations that were common or private to each of the samples . These control DNA samples were isolated from immortalized lymphoblasts ; however , the counts of private variants in the cases and controls were highly similar , sug­ gesting that the contribution of new somatic events is likely minimal ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . We determined by simulation the expected mean GERP and Grantham distributions for ten randomly selected common or private control single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) ( Online Methods ) . When we compared the observed means of the ten de novo protein­ altering ASD proband variants to the distribution of common control SNVs ( Fig . 1a ) , they corresponded to more highly con­ served ( GERP , P < 0 . 001 ) and disruptive amino acid mutations ( Grantham , P = 0 . 015 ) . If we limited the analysis to the private control SNVs , which serve as a proxy for evolutionarily young mutation events ( Fig . 1b ) , we again found that the de novo events were at the right tail of these distributions . Only the mean GERP score , however , remained significant ( GERP , P = 0 . 02 ; Grantham , P = 0 . 115 ) . In total , these results suggest that these de novo muta­ tion sites are subjected to stronger selection and are likely to have functional impact . We identified a subset of trios ( 4 out of 20 ) with disruptive de novo mutations that are potentially causative , including genes previously associated with autism , intellectual disability and epilepsy ( Table 2 and Supplementary Note ) . We examined the available clinical data for these four families and found that they were among the most severely affected individuals in our study based on intelligence quo­ tient ( IQ ) measures and on calibrated severity score 20 ( CSS ) , which is largely independent from IQ and focuses specifically on autistic features , with a score of 10 being the most severe ( Fig . 1c , d ) . For example , in proband 12681 , we identified a single­base substitution ( IVS9­2A > G ) at the canonical 3 ′ splice site of exon 10 in GRIN2B ( encoding glutamate receptor , ionotropic , N­methyl D­aspartate 2B ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . This subject is severely affected ( CSS 9 ) , with evidence of early onset , possible regression and co­morbidity for mild intellectual disability . Expression and association studies have suggested that glutamatergic neurotransmission may play a role in ASDs 4 . Recently , a study 21 described GRIN2A and GRIN2B as sites of recurrent de novo mutations in individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disability and / or epilepsy , suggesting variable expressivity . Our data suggest that de novo mutations in GRIN2B may also lead to an ASD presentation . table 1 summary of the exome sequencing results from 20 sporadic AsD probands Family SSC / SAGE ID a Proband sex Paternal age b Maternal age b Trio bases c Percent target d Coding SNVs e Rare disruptive SNVs f Coding indels e Rare indels g Protein coding de novo events 11048 M 358 358 23 , 901 , 726 88 . 19 14 , 095 ( 752 ) 131 74 ( 44 ) 27 0 11307 M 421 407 23 , 549 , 536 86 . 89 13 , 509 ( 583 ) 75 64 ( 40 ) 19 0 11580 M 443 305 23 , 823 , 712 87 . 90 13 , 912 ( 642 ) 89 62 ( 36 ) 24 1 11666 M 398 370 24 , 179 , 474 89 . 21 14 , 306 ( 622 ) 77 59 ( 40 ) 25 1 12325 M 363 313 24 , 088 , 772 88 . 88 13 , 866 ( 629 ) 79 65 ( 43 ) 24 1 12499 M 425 372 25 , 217 , 651 93 . 04 14 , 479 ( 634 ) 86 80 ( 47 ) 21 3 12575 M 351 317 24 , 259 , 870 89 . 51 14 , 568 ( 679 ) 78 80 ( 55 ) 26 0 12647 M 541 413 24 , 669 , 129 91 . 02 14 , 144 ( 830 ) 78 68 ( 42 ) 22 1 12680 M 502 471 24 , 437 , 989 90 . 16 14 , 124 ( 642 ) 69 70 ( 42 ) 24 2 12681 F 399 375 24 , 723 , 806 91 . 22 14 , 750 ( 691 ) 93 68 ( 39 ) 20 2 12817 M 485 430 24 , 520 , 475 90 . 47 14 , 364 ( 656 ) 83 72 ( 38 ) 24 2 12974 M 366 365 24 , 235 , 164 89 . 42 13 , 990 ( 555 ) 52 54 ( 37 ) 23 0 13095 M 337 322 24 , 460 , 239 90 . 25 14 , 605 ( 645 ) 66 89 ( 54 ) 29 0 13253 M 436 427 24 , 070 , 345 88 . 81 13 , 775 ( 610 ) 96 41 ( 25 ) 16 2 13284 h M 300 302 24 , 911 , 060 91 . 91 17 , 806 ( 639 ) 111 151 ( 79 ) 53 1 13466 M 353 385 24 , 676 , 574 91 . 05 14 , 023 ( 591 ) 72 58 ( 39 ) 23 0 13683 M 470 402 24 , 139 , 439 89 . 06 14 , 419 ( 725 ) 73 72 ( 49 ) 22 0 13708 M 397 382 23 , 933 , 169 88 . 30 13 , 997 ( 686 ) 77 78 ( 41 ) 26 2 13970 M 313 234 24 , 465 , 009 90 . 26 14 , 293 ( 626 ) 84 89 ( 58 ) 31 0 SAGE4022 F 271 283 24 , 130 , 743 89 . 03 14 , 538 ( 713 ) 141 86 ( 56 ) 29 0 Average 18M : 2F 397 362 24 , 319 , 694 89 . 73 14 , 378 ( 658 ) 86 74 ( 45 ) 25 0 . 9 a Simons Simplex Collection ( SSC ) or Study of Autism Genetics Exploration ( SAGE ) family number . b Paternal and maternal ages ( in months ) at time of conception were estimated based on month - year birth information assuming a 9 - month pregnancy . c Number of bases covered at 8× and Q30 in all three individuals . d ± 2 bp . e Numbers in parentheses denote variants not present in dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project pilot data . f Not observed in 1 , 490 other exomes sequenced at the University of Washington . g Not equal to 3 n . h Included additional RefSeq targets . © 2011 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . Nature GeNetics aDVaNCE ONLINE PUBLICaTION 3 l e t t e r s Proband 12499 has a missense variant ( p . Pro1894Leu ) at a highly conserved position in SCN1A ( encoding sodium channel , voltage­ gated , type I , alpha subunit ) that is predicted to be functionally del­ eterious ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . This subject is severely affected ( CSS 8 ) , with evidence of early onset , possible regression , language delay , a diagnosis of epilepsy and mild intellectual disability . SCN1A was previously associated with epilepsy and has been suggested as an ASDs candidate gene 22 , 23 , although limited screening has been conducted in idiopathic ASDs . Hundreds of disease­associated muta­ tions have been described in epilepsy , and typically individuals with de novo events show more severe phenotypes 24 . The proband also carries the maternally inherited 15q11 . 2 deletion that increases the risk for epilepsy 10 . Proband 11666 has a missense variant ( p . Asp399Gly ) at a highly conserved position within the second laminin­type epidermal growth factor­like domain of LAMC3 ( encoding laminin , gamma 3 ) that is predicted to be functionally deleterious ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . This subject is severely affected ( CSS 10 ) , with evidence of early onset and moderate intellectual disability . LAMC3 is not known to be involved in neuronal development ; however , human microarray data have shown expression in many areas of the cortex and limbic system 25 . Additional study is warranted , as laminins have structural similarities to the neurexin and contactin­associated families of pro­ teins , both of which have been associated with ASDs 2 . The fourth example of a potentially causative mutation is a single­ base insertion in FOXP1 ( encoding forkhead box P1 ) introducing a frameshift and premature stop codon ( p . Ala339Ser fs X4 ) in proband 12817 ( Fig . 1e ) . This subject is severely affected ( CSS 8 ) , with evidence for regression , language delay and co­morbidity for moderate intel­ lectual disability and nonfebrile seizures . Recently , rare occurrences of large de novo deletions and a nonsense variant disrupting FOXP1 were reported in individuals with mild to moderate intellectual dis­ ability and language defects , with or without ASD features 26 , 27 . FOXP1 encodes a member of the forkhead­box family of transcription factors and is closely related to FOXP2 , a gene implicated in rare monogenic forms of speech and language disorder 28 – 31 . Functional evidence of heterodimer formation and overlapping neural expression patterns suggests that FOXP1 and FOXP2 can co­regulate gene expression in the brain 32 , 33 . We assessed relative levels of the mutant transcript in proband­derived lymphoblasts and found strong evidence for nonsense­mediated decay ( NMD ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . HEK293T cell­based functional assays further showed that , if translated , the protein would be truncated and mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , similar to results obtained with FOXP2 mutations 31 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b , c ) . Remarkably , in addition to the FOXP1 mutation , proband 12817 also carried an inherited missense variant ( p . His275Ala ) at a highly conserved position in CNTNAP2 ( encoding contactin associated protein­like 2 ) that is predicted to be functionally deleterious . This variant is likely to be extremely rare or private , as it was not observed in 942 previously sequenced controls 34 or in 1 , 490 other exomes . CNTNAP2 is directly downregulated by FOXP2 ( ref . 35 ) and has been independently associated with ASD and specific language impair­ ment 34 – 37 . In HEK293T cells , we found that wild­type FOXP1 sig­ nificantly reduced expression of CNTNAP2 ( P = 0 . 0005 ) , whereas the truncated protein was associated with a threefold expression increase ( P = 0 . 0056 ) ( Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . Overall , we hypothesize that FOXP1 haploinsufficiency ( caused by NMD ) , combined with dysfunction of FOXP1 mutant proteins that escape this process , may result in overexpression of CNTNAP2 protein , amplifying any deleterious effects of p . His275Ala in the proband . Among the ~ 110 ( 85 SNVs and 25 indels ) previously unreported inherited protein­altering variants in each proband , we identified sev­ eral rare inherited variants in genes overlapping SFARI Gene 38 , a curated database of potential ASD candidate loci , but we saw no excessive table 2 summary of confirmed de novo mutation events Proband type Chromosome : position Gene symbol Variant Amino acid change GerP score Grantham score PolyPhen - 2 CpG ts / tv Mutation origin sNVs 11580 . p1 Missense Chr20 : 2 , 239 , 665 TGM3 R p .

Although the numbers of subjects from our pilot study are few , we did observe two cases with a notable de novo event and a potential inherited risk variant ( 12817 . p1 , FOXP1 and CNTNAP2 ; 12499 . p1 , SCN1A and 15q11 . 2 deletion ) , highlighting that in some sporadic families a multi­hit model may be playing a role 3 ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . In the future , this hypothesis could be further explored by comparing burden in a much larger number of affected­unaffected sibling pairs . The probands with the four potentially causative de novo events met strict criteria for a diagnosis of autistic disorder ( Supplementary Note ) . Our finding of de novo events in genes that have also been disrupted in children with intellectual disability without ASD , intel­ lectual disability with ASD features or epilepsy provides further evidence that these genetic pathways may lead to a spectrum of neuro­ developmental outcomes depending on the genetic and environmen­ tal context 2 , 4 . Recent data suggest that CNVs may also blur these lines , with diverse conditions all showing association to the same loci 2 , 4 . Distinguishing primary from secondary effects will require a better understanding of the underlying biology and identification of interacting genetic and environmental factors within the pheno­ typic context of the family . The identification of de novo events along with disruptive inherited mutations underlying ‘sporadic’ ASDs has the potential to fundamentally transform our understanding of the genetic basis of autism .

We examined 20 families where there was a single child with a diagnosis of ASD obtained from the Simons Simplex Collection ( SSC ) 39 ( n = 19 ) and the Study of Autism Genetics Exploration ( SAGE ) ( n = 1 ) . We required subjects to have at least one unaffected sibling with no history of ASD or intellectual disability based on medical history and / or pedigree evaluation . Parents showed no signs of a broader autism phenotype based on Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire 40 ( cutoff ≤ 3 ) and Adult­Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) 41 ( cutoff ≤ 40 ) . Siblings were discordant for the SRS and Vineland­II , with the unaffected sibling falling within the normal range . Control exomes . Exome sequence data from 20 unrelated CEPH Utah samples of European ancestry were obtained from immortalized lymphoblast extracted genomic DNA and processed through the same variant calling pipeline . Control simulation . Protein­altering control variants were randomly shuf­ fled , and ten were selected over 1 , 000 trials to build an expected distribution of common or rare events , computing the mean Grantham and GERP scores for each trial . Empirical P values were then calculated based on the number of trials in which the control mean was greater than the observed mean of the ten proband disruptive de novo variants . Other control exomes . Variants were screened against exome calls from 1 , 490 samples to remove common variants and systematic artifacts . Samples were obtained from the NHLBI Lung Cohort Sequencing Project ( n = 635 ) , the NHLBI WHI Sequencing Project ( n = 744 ) , NIEHS SNPs ( n = 87 ) and NHLBI / NHGRI SeattleSeq and NHGRI Next Generation Mendelian Genetics ( n = 24 ) . Array CGH . We designed custom targeted arrays comprising 135 , 000 probes ( Roche NimbleGen ) with higher density probe coverage ( mean probe spacing 2 . 5 kb ) in genomic hotspots and a lower probe density in genomic backbone ( with mean probe spacing of 38 kb ) . Microarray hybridization experiments and CNV analysis were performed as described previously 42 , 43 using a single unaffected male reference ( GM15724 from Coriell ) . ASD exome library construction . Exome shotgun libraries were prepared as described previously 44 from 3 µ g whole­blood extracted genomic DNA with modifications for solution­based capture using either a standard or a barcoding protocol . Each member of a trio received matching protocols . In the standard protocol , pre­capture PCR was performed in four reactions per sample , with each reaction in a 40 µ l volume with 10 µ l of library , 1× iProof High Fidelity Master Mix ( Bio­Rad ) and 0 . 625 µ M of each primer under the following conditions : 96 °C for 2 min , 16 cycles of 96 °C for 20 s , 63 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s and , finally , 72 °C for 5 min . Reactions for each sample were pooled and column purified ( PCR Purification Kit , Qiagen ) . In the barcoded protocol , pre­capture PCR was performed in five reactions per sample , with each reaction in a 40 µ l volume with 10 µ l of library , 1× iProof High Fidelity Master Mix ( Bio­Rad ) and 0 . 625 µ M of each primer under the following con­ ditions : 98 °C for 30 s , six cycles of 98 °C for 10 s , 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s and , finally , 72 °C for 5 min . Reactions for each sample were pooled and bead purified ( AMPure , Agencourt ) . Library capture and sequencing . For each library , 1 µ g was hybridized for 72 h at 47 °C with SeqCap EZ Exome probes v1 . 0 ( Roche ) as per manufacturer’s protocols and blocked with 100 µ l human Cot1 DNA ( Invitrogen ) and 10 µ l each blocker primer at 100 µ M ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . For standard preps pre­sequencing PCR , ten reactions were performed per sample , with each reac­ tion in a 50 µ l volume with 4 µ l of library , 1× iProof High Fidelity Master Mix ( Bio­Rad ) and 0 . 625 µ M of each primer under the following conditions : 98 °C for 30 s , 20 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s , 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and , finally , 72 °C for 5 min . Reactions for each sample were pooled and column purified . For barcode preps , five reactions were performed per sample , with each reac­ tion in a 50 µ l volume with 10 µ l of library as above , but for only 13 cycles . Reactions for each sample were pooled and bead purified . Family 13284 was also captured using a custom RefSeq solid state array ( Agilent ) as described 45 . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx according to the manufacturer’s instructions for single or paired­end 76­bp reads . Estimating the expected mutation rate . We used mutation rates published by Lynch 14 , as he provides an estimate of substitution , insertion and deletion rates and is in close agreement with other recent estimates 15 , 46 . We first calcu­ lated the number of callable bases in the first six completed trios that directly overlapped or were within 2 bp of the ends of the exon coordinates from the current hg18 build of the Consensus Coding Sequence ( CCDS ) project . This analysis yielded 22 , 546 , 796 coding and 523 , 843 splice bases covered in an average trio . Using the following haploid mutation rates ( substitution rate of 1 . 28 × 10 −8 , deletion rate of 5 . 80 × 10 −10 and insertion rate of 2 . 00 × 10 −10 ) , we calculated total number of substitution , indel and splice­site events . Finally , we separated the expected substitutions based their probably of causing an amino acid change under a random model of 25 % synonymous , 71 . 25 % missense and 3 . 75 % nonsense substitutions . Exome data analysis for SNVs and small indels . The exome definition was based on consensus coding sequence ( CCDS 2009 ) of the human reference genome ( build36 ) . For BWA ( 0 . 5 . 6 ) 47 mapped reads , we removed reads with mapping scores of zero , incorrect or unmapped pairs and potential duplicates . Consensus genotypes were generated using SAMtools ( 0 . 1 . 7 ) 48 . Variant posi­ tions were then pulled and filtered using the samtools . pl varFilter ( all defaults except , ­D 10000 and awk ′ ( $ 3 = = ” * ” & & $ 6 > = 50 ) | | ( $ 3 ! = ” * ” & & $ 6 > = 20 ) ′ ) . Variants were then run through a custom pipeline , Haystack , to identify Mendelian errors . For SNVs , proband variants were filtered to 8× and con­ sensus or SNP quality 30 positions that were called in the entire trio . Possibly de novo events were then compared against 1 , 490 other exomes sequenced at University of Washington to remove systematic artifacts and rare population variants . Variants were then annotated using the SeattleSeq server ( see URLs ) . Possibly de novo events were manually inspected using the IGV browser 15 . Base pair positions where > 10 % of the parental reads were concordant with the putative de novo event were excluded . We found that approximately one­third of on­target de novo calls mapped to exons within segmental duplications 49 and likely represent paralogous sequence variants from missing duplicated genes or variants of limited functional consequence 50 . For BWA called indels , variants were filtered to a high confidence set supported by at least 30 % of the reads with a minimum of eight variant reads . Positions without an indel call or 8× and consensus or SNP quality 30 position in both parents were removed . Variants were then annotated using a custom script , compared to dbSNP129 and dbSNP130 and 1000 Genomes Pilot indels and manually inspected . Exome data analysis for large indels and CNVs . We used a general split­ read – based combinatorial algorithm ( E . K . , C . Alkan , B . J . O . , D . A . N . & E . E . E . , unpublished data ) to detect structural variation in the form of insertions , deletions and copy number variants ranging in length from 1 bp to 1 Mb . This method identifies one­end anchored placements using mrsFAST 51 alignments . The unmapped ends of the one­end anchored reads are split into pieces at the breakpoints of possible indels . Our method computes the exact breakpoints of these splits and aims to map them back to the reference exome efficiently . The final set of indels is reported based on these consistent split mappings around these events within basepair resolution . De novo validation . Possibly de novo variants were tested by designing custom primers with Primer3 ( see URLs ) , performing standard PCR reactions using 10 ng of DNA from the proband , father , mother and for 19 out of 20 families an unaffected sibling , followed by Sanger sequencing . Family 12817 complementary DNA ( cDNA ) analysis . Transformed live lymphoblast cell lines were obtained on the father , mother , proband and two siblings from family 12817 . Cultures were grown as described 52 and split into two flasks , one of which was supplemented with 100 µ g / ml of emetine ( Sigma ) to inhibit NMD 52 . After 7 h of incubation , total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . First strand cDNA was generated using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Roche ) .

Nature GeNetics doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 835 described elsewhere 31 . The FOXP1mut construct was directly synthesized by GenScript USA Inc . All constructs were expressed from the pcDNA4 / HisMax vector and were in frame with an N­terminal vector­encoded Xpress tag . The anti­Xpress mouse monoclonal antibody ( Invitrogen ) was used to detect protein expression of all FOXP constructs . β ­actin mouse monoclonal antibody ( Sigma ) was used as loading control . HEK293T cells were cultured as described 31 and transfected with either empty pcDNA4 / HisMax vector or with pcDNA4 / HisMax FOXP constructs using Genejuice ( Novagen ) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruc­ tions . Forty­eight hours after transfection , cells were either lysed and resolved by SDS­PAGE or seeded on coverslips for immunofluorescence , as previously described 31 . For quantitative PCR , total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions 48 h post transfection . Five hundred nanograms total RNA was reverse­ transcribed using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase and random primers ( Invitrogen ) . Quantitative real­time PCR was performed on an iQ5 ( Bio­Rad ) ( Supplementary Table 9 ) . 41 . Constantino , J . N . & Todd , R . D .
