Schmid 1 Abstract Metastasis is a multistep process requiring cancer cell signaling , invasion , migration , survival , and proliferation . These processes require dynamic modulation of cell surface proteins by endocy - tosis . Given this functional connection , it has been suggested that endocytosis is dysregulated in cancer . To test this , we developed In - Cell ELISA assays to measure three different endocytic path - ways : clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae - mediated endocy - tosis , and clathrin - independent endocytosis and compared these activities using two different syngeneic models for normal and oncogene - transformed human lung epithelial cells . We found thatallendocyticactivitieswerereducedinthetransformedversus normal counterparts . However , when we screened 29 indepen - dently isolated non – small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines to determine whether these changes were systematic , we observed signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity . Nonetheless , using hierarchical cluster - ing based on their combined endocytic properties , we identi ﬁ ed two phenotypically distinct clusters of NSCLCs . One co - clustered with mutations in KRAS , a mesenchymal phenotype , increased invasion through collagen and decreased growth in soft agar , whereas the second was enriched in cells with an epithelial phenotype . Interestingly , the two clusters also differed signi ﬁ - cantly in clathrin - independent internalization and surface expres - sion of CD44 and CD59 . Taken together , our results suggest that endocytotic alterations in cancer cells that affect cell surface expression of critical molecules have a signi ﬁ cant in ﬂ uence on cancer - relevant phenotypes , with potential implications for inter - ventions to control cancer by modulating endocytic dynamics .

Introduction Tumor cell growth and metastasis involve changes in cell – cell and cell – matrix interactions , survival and proliferative signaling , and nutrient uptake , all of which depend on plasma membrane receptors and transporters ( 1 , 2 ) . Signaling from the cell surface and the interactions of cells with each other and their environment are dynamically regulated by the endo - cytosis of signaling , adhesion , and nutrient receptors . Conse - quently , it has been suggested that endocytosis is dysregulated in cancer cells ( 3 – 5 ) . Indeed , there are numerous examples of cancer - speci ﬁ c mutations in components of the endocytic machinery and / or changes in their levels of expression ( 6 – 10 ) . It has also been reported that endocytic traf ﬁ cking can be perturbed downstream of oncogenes such as p53 and Ras ( 11 , 12 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and caveolae - mediat - ed endocytosis ( CavME ) remain the best - characterized endo - cytic pathways , although other more recently discovered and mechanistically distinct pathways have been shown to mediate the uptake of different subsets of signaling , adhesion , and nutrient receptors , as well as regulate the surface expression of membrane transporters ( 13 – 15 ) . These alternate pathways , generally referred to as clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) , include the recently discovered clathrin - and dynamin - 2 ( Dyn2 ) - independent uptake into so - called clathrin - indepen - dent carriers ( CLIC ) , which involve the small GTPases Rac1 , Cdc42 , and Arf6 ( 14 – 18 ) . To what extent these CIE pathways contribute to the endocytic capacity of the cell remains unclear , as some studies suggest they are the major pathway for bulk uptake ( 17 ) , whereas a more recent study suggests that CME can account for virtually all bulk uptake ( 19 ) . Past studies of endocytosis in cancer cells have focused pri - marily on CME and CavME , and these have been studied , indi - vidually , in only a few cancer cell lines . Hence , it is unknown whether endocytic activities are selectively or randomly altered in cancers . Moreover , few studies have correlated the activities of speci ﬁ cendocyticpathwayswithchangesincellularbehaviorsuch as migration , adhesiveness , or proliferation . To address these issues , we have systematically and quantitatively analyzed mul - tiple endocytic activities across a clinically diverse and molecu - larly characterized panel of non – small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines ( 20 , 21 ) . Our studies reveal signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity across cell lines and endocytic pathways , which we utilize to test for correlations between speci ﬁ c endocytic activities and altera - tions in cellular processes related to cancer , including prolifera - tion , adhesion , and migration . 1 Department of Cell Biology , UT Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas . 2 Department of Clinical Science and Quantitative Biomedical Research Center ( QBRC ) , UT Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas . 3 The Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research , UT Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas . 4 Departments of Internal MedicineandPharmacology , UTSouthwesternMedicalCenter , Dallas , Texas .

CAN - 15 - 0939 Materials and Methods Cell lines and culture HBEC30KT and the NSCLC cancer cell lines were generated as previously described ( 20 ) . HBEC3KT and their oncogene - trans - formed derivatives were developed by the Minna lab ( 22 ) . All NSCLC lines used in this study were obtained from the Hamon Cancer Center Collection ( UT Southwestern Medical Center ) and maintained in RPMI - 1640 ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 5 % FCS at 37 (cid:1) C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 and 95 % air . All cell lines have been DNA ﬁ ngerprinted using the PowerPlex 1 . 2 Kit ( Promega ) and are mycoplasma free using the e - Myco Kit ( Boca Scienti ﬁ c ) . Culture media were pur - chased from Life Technologies . Human bronchial epithelial cell ( HBEC ) , NSCLC , and Human retinal epithelia ARPE - 19 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultivated in complete KSF medium , RPMI - 5 % FBS ( Sigma ) , or in DMEM / F12 - 10 % FBS , respectively . Antibodies and reagents Anti - TfnR ( HTR - D65 ) monoclonal antibody was produced in hybridoma as in ref . 23 . Anti - CHC ( sc - 12734 ) and anti – Dyn - 2 ( sc - 64000 ) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech - nology . FITC - conjugated anti - CD44 ( G44 - 26 ) and anti - CD59 ( p282 - H19 ) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen . Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) – and AlexaFluor - conjugated antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies . Biotinylated albumin ( # A8549 ) , OPD ( # P1536 ) , nystatin ( # N6261 ) , poly - l - Lysine ( # P1536 ) , ﬁ bronectin ( # F1141 ) , lami - nin ( # L2020 ) , and hyaluronic acid ( # H5388 ) were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . Rat - tail collagen ( # 354236 ) and streptavidin - POD were purchased from BD Biosciences and from Roche , respectively . Fluoromount G and paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences . Transferrin receptor , albumin , CD44 , and CD59 internalization TfnR , CD44 , or CD59 internalizations were performed using receptor - speci ﬁ cmAbs . Weusedbiotinylatedalbumintomeasure Cav - ME . Cells were seeded at a density of 2 . 8 (cid:3) 10 4 cells / well on collagen - coated 96 - well plates and grown overnight . For assays , cells were washed ( 3 (cid:3) PBS ) and incubated with40 m L PBS 4 þ ( PBS supplementedwith1mmol / LMgCl 2 , 1mmol / LCaCl 2 , 5mmol / L glucose , and 0 . 2 % BSA ) containing 4 m g / mL mAb or 30 m g / mL biotinylated albumin at 37 (cid:1) C for the indicated time points before being immediately cooled to 4 (cid:1) C to arrest internalization and washed to remove unbound ligand ( 3 (cid:3) PBS ) . The remaining surface - bound ligand was removed by acid washes ( 4 (cid:3) 1 minute 0 . 2 mol / L acetic acid , 0 . 2 mol / L NaCl , pH 2 ) . Cells were washed withPBSandthen ﬁ xedin4 % PFA ( ElectronMicroscopySciences ) inPBSfor10minutesat4 (cid:1) Cand10minutesatroomtemperature . Cells were then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 / PBS for 5 minutes , washed , and then blocked with 5 % BSA / casein for 1 hour . Internalized albumin was assessed using streptavidin - POD ( Roche ) . Internalized D65 , CD44 , and CD59 mAbs were assessed using a goat anti - mouse HRP - conjugated antibody and further developed with 200 m L OPD . The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 m L 5 mol / L H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance was read at 490 nm ( Biotek Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader ) . Well - to - well vari - ability in cell number was accounted for by normalizing the reading at 490 nm with a BCA readout at 560 nm ( Biotek Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader ) . The fraction of internalized ligand was calculated relative to the initial total surface - bound ligand at 4 (cid:1) C ( without the acid wash step ) measured in parallel for all the assays . Data represent mean (cid:4) SD from four independent experi - ments , each performed in triplicate . To visualize internalization by ﬂ uorescence microscopy , HBEC30KT and HCC4017 cells were seeded in 8 - well chambers . The same procedure as for the In Cell ELISA was used to generate " Surface - bound " and " Internalized " ligands except that after permeabilization the cells were incubated with suitable Alexa - Fluor - labeled secondary antibodies and then mounted with Fluoromount G . Images were captured using a 60 (cid:3) objective mounted on a Ti - Eclipse inverted microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2 monochrome CCD camera ( Photometrics ) . For siRNA - mediated inhibition of endocytosis , RNAiMAX trans - fection reagent ( Life Technologies ) was used to deliver siRNA targeting Dyn2 ( 1 : 1 mixture of Dyn2 _ 1 : 5 0 - CCGAAUCAAUCG - CAUCUUCUU - 3 0 and Dyn2 _ 2 : 5 0 - GACAUGAUCCUGCAGUU - CAUU - 3 0 ) or clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ; ref . 24 ) to H1299 cells , following the manufacturer ' s instructions . We used All Star Neg - ative siRNA as a control . Cells were used 72 hours after siRNA transfection . For inhibition by nystatin , H1299 cells were pre - incubated in the absence ( control ) or presence of 25 m g / mL nystatin for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:1) C before internalization assays were performed as described above except the PBS 4 þ contained nystatin . Proliferation , adhesion assays , and 3D migration assays The following microscopy - based assays were performed in 96 - well black plates with clear bottom ( PerkinElmer # 600525 ) . Proliferation . A total of 2 , 000 cells / well of each cell line were dispensed , in triplicate . Five hours after plating , cells from the ﬁ rst plate — " Day 0 " plate — were ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA and stored at 4 (cid:1) C . The same operation was repeated on days 1 through 5 . Cell nuclei were stained for 30 minutes with 10 m g / mL Hoechst / PBS solution . Cell proliferation was expressed as the ratio of cell counts on " Day 5 " / " Day 0 " plates . Adhesion . 96 - well plates were incubated with 40 m L / well for 1 hour containing 10 m g / mL BSA , 0 . 01 % poly - l - Lysine , 50 m g / mL rat tail collagen , 10 m g / mL ﬁ bronectin , 50 m g / mL laminin or incubated overnight with 1 mg / mL hyaluronic acid . After plates were washed with PBS , 15 , 000 cells / well were plated and allowed to adhere for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:1) C . Floating cells were then removed by three washes with PBS . Cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA and nuclei were stained for 30 minutes with 10 m g / mL Hoechst / PBS solution . Cell adhesion represents the number of cells per condition . 3Dmigration assay . Assayswereperformed using1mg / mLbovine collagen and 2 . 5 % FBS as chemoattractant , following the exper - imental procedure described in ref . 25 . Microscopy images of nuclear staining were taken at 50 m m steps from 0 to 150 m m into the collagen plug . Invasion index was calculated as the sum of cell counts at 50 , 100 , and 150 m m over cell counts at 0 m m . Cell nuclei were visualized using a 20 (cid:3) ( migration assays ) or 10 (cid:3) ( proliferation and adhesion assays ) air objective mounted on a T i - Eclipse inverted microscope ( Nikon ) driven by NIS Ele - ments V4 . 13 software and quanti ﬁ ed using the " Object Count " feature of NIS Elements software .

CAN - 15 - 0939 Growth in soft agar . Anchorage - independent growth in soft agar was performed by seeding cells in 0 . 4 % noble agar on top of a 1 % layer . After 3 weeks , cell foci were stained with a Crystal Violet solution and extensively washed with water to remove excess stain . Foci were then counted manually using the Cell Counter tool on ImageJ software . Statistical analysis and hierarchical clustering A hierarchical clustering algorithm ( 26 ) was used to group the 29 NSCLC cell lines based on their collective endocytic activities . For this purpose , we took the averaged endocytic activity across replicates for each cell line and each pathway ( Supplementary Table S1 ) , and then used these values to calculate Pearson cor - relation distance metrics , average linkages ( 26 ) , and then gener - ated the hierarchical clustering results using GENE - E software from GenePattern ( 27 ) with default settings . The hierarchical tree identi ﬁ ed two clusters . We tested the signi ﬁ cance of the clustering result using the R package sigclust by using the 2 - means clustering index as a statistic to test the null hypothesis that a group of samples is from a single Gaussian distribution ( 28 ) . Migration and growth in soft - agar enrichment analysis for two clusters were measured by the Fisher exact test to examine whether the two kinds of classi ﬁ cation from categorical data are associated , which is best suited for small sample sizes and a 2 (cid:3) 2 contingency table . We tested association of the two clusters with endocytic activities and the total surface protein expression using a Wilcoxon rank sum test , which compares the sums of ranks and is more robust to the presence of outliers . The statistical correlations between each endocytic activity and cell proliferation were calculated by the Spearman rank correlation test , which is less sensitive to outliers and queries the extent of dependence of one ranked variable on another . Correlations between KRAS mutations and endocytic activities were also measured by the Wilcoxon rank sum test . Results Choice of pathway - speci ﬁ c and lung cancer – related endocytic markers CME and CavME have been extensively studied , and speci ﬁ c markers allowing the quanti ﬁ cation of these endocytic routes are well described . We chose transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) for CME ( 29 ) and albumin , which binds to gp60 and is internalized by CavME ( 30 ) . Although markers for clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytotic pathways are less well characterized , glycophospha - tidylinositol - anchored proteins ( GPI - AP ) are reportedly internal - ized by these routes ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) . For our studies , we chose complement lysis restricting factor / CD59 ( 31 ) , a GPI - AP that is involved in cellular processes critical to lung cancer cell survival and internalized via CIE ( 32 , 33 ) . Recent studies have identi ﬁ ed the transmembrane glycoprotein , CD44 , which is a hyaluronic acid receptor , as a cargo molecule speci ﬁ cally internalized by CLICs and recycled via GPI - enriched endocytic compartments ( GEEC ; refs . 15 , 34 ) . CD44 becomes more concentrated in ﬂ o - tillin - low or non - raft fractions , presumably corresponding to CLICs , in migrating breast cancer cells ( 35 ) . Interestingly , CD44 is expressed in NSCLC , but not in small cell lung cancer ( 36 ) . ElevatedexpressionlevelsofCD44combinedwithlowexpression of CD24 ( CD44 high / CD24 low ) is an emergent prognosis tool in the clinic as it is associated with " stemness " features of cancer cells in vivo and in vitro ( 36 – 38 ) . Together , these markers allowed us to directly measure the CME , CavME , and CIE activities in NSCLC cells . Development of pathway - speci ﬁ c 96 - well endocytosis assays To ef ﬁ ciently and systematically measure multiple endocytic pathways using several NSCLC cell lines in parallel , we devel - oped a new sensitive and quantitative method using 96 - well plates , referred to as an In - Cell ELISA ( see Materials and Methods ) . As ARPE - 19 cells have been routinely used to study CME , we used this cell line to set up and validate the high - throughput assay . Upon incubation of ARPE - 19 cells at 37 (cid:1) C with the anti - transferrin receptor antibody HTR . D65 ( D65 ; ref . 39 ) , we could detect the time - and temperature - dependent accumulation ( expressed as the fraction internalized at 37 (cid:1) C over the total surface bound at 4 (cid:1) C ) of intracellular D65 ( Supplementary Fig . S1A , left , quanti ﬁ cation in B ) . The use of the bivalent anti - TfnR mAb , rather than transferrin , as ligand reduces rapid recycling ( 40 ) and enables us to focus our measurements on initial rates of internalization . As a negative control for internalization of surface - bound versus soluble mAb , we incubated these cells with a speci ﬁ c antibody against the T - cell marker CD8 , which is not expressed on epithelial cells . As expected , we did not detect surface binding or any internalization of anti - CD8 in APRE - 19 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1A , right , quanti ﬁ cation in B ) . This assay was adapted to measure CavME using biotiny - lated - albumin as ligand , and CIE using anti - CD59 or anti - CD44 mAbs as markers , and validated in the NSCLC line , H1299 . We ﬁ rst con ﬁ rmed that these different surface receptors utilized different pathways by siRNA knockdown of CHC , which is speci ﬁ cally required for CME and dynamin 2 ( Dyn2 ) , which is required for both CME and CavME ( Fig . 1A ) . We also treated cells with the antifungal drug nystatin that disrupts the plasma membrane cholesterol and selectively inhibits CavME , but not CME . As expected , CME of TfnR was inhibited upon RNAi - mediated knockdown of either Dyn2 or CHC ( Fig . 1B ) , whereas nystatin showed no effect . Also , as expected , uptake of albumin by CavME was inhibited upon RNAi knockdown of Dyn2 and treatment with nystatin ( Fig . 1C ) , but was unaffected by CHC knockdown . Finally , uptake of CD44 and CD59 was not affected by either of these perturbations ( Fig . 1D and E ) , con ﬁ rming that these markers are internalized by a clathrin - , Dyn2 - , and caveolae - independent mechanism . These data establish our ability to independently and selectively measure at least three distinct endocytic pathways . Altered endocytic activity across pathways in isogenic normal and cancer cell lines We next compared the endocytic activities in an NSCLC cell line ( HCC4017 ) with those in a normal , nontumorigenic HBEC line , HBEC30KT , derived from the same patient . The HBEC30KT cells were immortalized by serial introduction of retroviral expression vectors encoding cyclin - dependent kinase 4 ( Cdk4 ) , which prevents premature growth arrest , and human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) , which bypasses telo - mere - dependent senescence ( 41 ) . The internalization rates of all four receptors , expressed as the fraction internalized after 5 minutes at 37 (cid:1) C over the total surface bound at 4 (cid:1) C , were reduced in the NSCLC cells as compared with their normal HBEC30KT counterpart ( Fig . 2A ) . This was con ﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 2B – E ) , which also illustrates the uniformity in uptake among the cells within each line . These results suggest that endocytosis may indeed be altered in cancer cells . Elkin et al .

CAN - 15 - 0939 Malignant transformation of HBEC alters endocytosis To determine when changes in endocytosis might occur during the transformation process , we obtained normal HBEC3KT cell lines along with their derivatives with the following oncogenetic modi ﬁ cations common to lung cancer : ( i ) p53 de ﬁ ciency trig - geredbystableshRNA - mediatedknockdownofp53 ( sh - p53 ) , ( ii ) overexpression of activated KRAS ( KRAS V12 ) , ( iii ) both sh - p53 and KRAS V12 , or ( iv ) sh - p53 , KRAS V12 , and c - myc overexpression . It had been previously shown that all three oncogenic changes were necessary and suf ﬁ cient for full oncogenic transformation of HBEC3KT cells as assessed by in vitro anchorage - independent growth and in vivo tumor formation after subcutaneous injection into NOD / SCID mice ( 22 ) . Consistent with this , the transfected cells were morphologically indistinguishable from the parent HBEC3KT cells until all three oncogenic mutations were present ( Fig . 3A ) , at which point they adopted a more elongated and irregularly shaped mesenchymal morphology similar to some NSCLC cell lines . We measured the various endocytic activities in these cells , and consistent with the need for all three changes to induce tumor formation in mice , only the HBEC3KT sh - p53 / KRASV12 / c - myc cell line exhibited decreased rates of uptake of all four markers ( Fig . 3B ) . Interestingly , the different endocytic pathways were differentially affected during the transformation process . For example , whereas the rate of CavME did not signi ﬁ cantly decrease until all three oncogenic changes were introduced , CME decreased linearly with each oncogenic modi ﬁ cation . CD44 and CD59 uptake , both thought to report CIE , also respond differently to the oncogenic changes . Introduction of the KRAS V12 mutant was suf ﬁ cient to decreaseCD59 - CIEactivitytoitslowestlevels , whereasCD44 - CIE activity was unaffected by expression of KRAS V12 alone , but was progressively reduced with the addition of sh - p53 and myc . Together , these data provide additional support that our assays measure distinct endocytic processes and establish that the dif - ferent endocytic pathways can be differentially sensitive to onco - genic changes . Importantly , as we had observed in comparing patient - matched normal HBEK30KT cells with HCC4017 NSCLC tumor - derived cells ( Fig . 2 ) , we again found that full oncogenic transformation of otherwise syngeneic HBEK3KT cells resulted in decreased rates of all endocytic activities measured . Systematic analysis of CME , CavME , and CIE in 29 NSCLC cell lines To determine whether there are indeed systematic changes in endocyticactivitiesassociatedwithNSCLC , wemeasuredtherates of uptake for all four endocytic pathways in NSCLC cell lines derived from 29 patients . These cell lines were chosen for their diverse molecular and clinical status ( e . g . , isolated from the primary tumor vs . metastases ) . All assays were performed in quadruplicate over multiple days with H1299 used as an internal control for each experiment ( see Materials and Methods ) . The data , which are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 ( avg . (cid:4) SD , n ¼ 4 for each pathway in each cell line ) and presented in Fig . 4A , show that the four endocytic activities varied signi ﬁ - cantly across all NSCLC lines . This variability cannot be attributed to differences in surface expression of the four molecular markers , as the rates of uptake did not correlate with changes in surface expression of receptors ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . For comparison , the rates of uptake determined in normal HBEC30KT and HBEC3KT cells were plotted as solid squares and triangles , respec - tively ( Fig . 4 ) . As shown with theisogenic pairs ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) , the majority of NSCLC cell lines have lower rates of uptake across all four pathways compared with the nontransformed HBEC lines ; however , several NSCLC cell lines had equal or higher rates of endocytosisespecially intheCD44 - CIE pathway , whichexhibited the greatest cell - to - cell variability . Thus , although our analyses of isogenic normal and NSCLC lines showed a consistent and signi ﬁ cant decrease in activity across all endocytic pathways , we ﬁ nd considerable heterogeneity in endocytic activities across a diverse panel of NSCLC cell lines . Given this heterogeneity , we asked whether changes in inter - nalization rates occurred randomly across the different endocytic routes , or if they positively or negatively correlated with one or more pathways . For this comparison , we ordered the 29 NSCLC celllinesfromlowtohigh , based ontheirratesofTfnRuptakeand compared these rates to those measured for other pathways ( Fig . 4B ) . We were unable to detect any correlation between CME or CavME and the other endocytic pathways . As expected , a similar patternemergedwhencomparingtherateofuptakeofthetwoCIE Figure 1 .

CAN - 15 - 0939 markers , CD44 and CD59 . However , consistent with their differ - ential response to the introduction of oncogenic changes ( Fig . 3B ) , clear , quantitative differences were also detected . Thus , these four pathways appear to be differentially regulated in cancer cells . Correlation of endocytic activities with cancer - related properties of NSCLC cell lines Giventhe differential effects of lossof p53incombination with overexpression of KRAS V12 and / or c - myc on endocytosis in HBEC3KT cells and their derivatives ( Fig . 3B ) , we next extracted information regarding the status of these three oncogenes for the 29 NSCLC cell lines from existing databases ( Fig . 5A ; refs . 42 – 44 ) . We wondered whether these oncogenic changes might correlate with their measured endocytic activities . The majority of the cell lines had functional mutations in p53 , whereas only about half had functional mutations in KRAS , and only 5 had increased expression of c - myc . In contrast with the results obtained with syngeneic cell lines , the three NSCLC lines exhibiting all three oncogenic changes ( H1792 , Hcc44 , and H2122 ) did not exhibit the lowest levels of endocytic activity for any of the pathways ( see Supplementary Table S1 ) . Indeed , there was no correlation between changes in activity of any of the endocytic pathways with p53 mutations or c - myc overexpression ( Supplementary Fig . S3A and S3B ) . We could detect a small , but signi ﬁ cant ( P < 0 . 1 , Figure 2 . Differential internalization of endocytic markers in matched patient - derived normal HBEC30KT and NSCLC ( HCC4017 ) cells .

CAN - 15 - 0939 Wilcoxon rank sum test ) correlation between KRAS mutations and a decrease in endocytic activity of both CIE pathways ( Fig . 5B ) ; however , there was no signi ﬁ cant correlation between KRAS mutations and CME or CavME . Thus , we were unable to detect systematic changes in endocytic activity corresponding to speci ﬁ c oncogenic changes in our panel of NSCLC cell lines . Several studies on individual cell lines have suggested roles for CME , CavME , and CIE in cancer progression ( 4 , 6 – 9 , 45 , 46 ) . Therefore , we next asked whether the heterogeneity observed in pathway - speci ﬁ c internalization rates might relate to differential activities of the 29 cell lines assessed in a panel of in vitro cancer - relevant assays . For this purpose , we established 96 - well assays to measure the following cellular processes ( see Materials and Methods ) : ( i ) 3D migration through a collagen matrix ; ( ii ) adhe - sion to different substrates ( collagen , ﬁ bronectin , laminin , and hyaluronic acid ) ; ( iii ) proliferation ; and ( iv ) growth in soft agar . Once again we observed signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity in these activ - ities across the different NSCLC lines ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . We applied the Spearman rank correlation test to determine whether differences in individual endocytic activities correlated with changes in any of the above properties . We detected a signi ﬁ cant negative correlation between proliferation and CIE pathway activity that was not seen for CME or CavME ( Supple - mentary Fig . S4 ) . However , we saw no signi ﬁ cant correlations between 3D migration , adhesion or growth in soft agar , and changes in either of the four individual endocytic activities ( Sup - plementary Figs . S5 and S6A ) . However , adhesion on one sub - strate was correlated with adhesion on another by Pairwise Pearson correlation comparison ( Supplementary Fig . S6B ) , pro - viding evidence for the validity of our measurements and dem - onstrating that the adhesion properties of these cells are not substrate speci ﬁ c . Hierarchical clustering based on endocytic activities re ﬂ ects cancer - related properties Previous studies have used hierarchical clustering analyses to classify NSCLCs based on histologic ( 47 ) , transcriptional ( 48 ) , and genetic differences ( 49 ) . To gain more insight into cancer cell properties that might be linked to their endocytic activities , we took a similar approach and conducted unsupervised hier - archical clustering analysis ( 26 ) of all 29 cell lines based on Pearson correlation distance metrics and average linkage of their measured endocytic activities using the raw data presented in Supplementary Table S1 ( see Materials and Methods ) . Hier - archical clustering based on the functional criteria of their collective endocytic behaviors identi ﬁ ed two clusters ( Fig . 6A ) . The signi ﬁ cance of the clustering result ( P ¼ 0 . 0037 ) was tested using the R package sigclust ( 50 ) . Whereas individual endocytic activities did not appear to correlate with other cancer cell properties , we were able to detect signi ﬁ cant Figure 3 .

CAN - 15 - 0939 differences in cancer cell properties between the two clusters derived from analysis of their collective endocytic activities . Cluster 1 was enriched in NSCLC cell lines that expressed mutant KRAS ( Fig . 6B ) and mesenchymal cell lines based on a published 76 gene signature ( 51 ) , whereas cluster 2 was enriched in NSCLC cell lines classi ﬁ ed , based on their gene signature , as epithelial ( P ¼ 0 . 02 , Fisher exact test ) . NSCLC cells in the two clusters also differed in their ability to migrate through collagen and their growth in soft agar . Cluster 1 exhibited a greater ability to migrate through collagen as com - pared with cluster 2 ( Fig . 6C , P ¼ 0 . 0641 , Fisher exact test as assessed by categorical correlation for migratory or nonmigratory behavior of the two clusters ) . However , the majority of NSCLC cell lines ( 54 % of cluster 1 and 81 % of cluster 2 ) failed to migrate undertheseconditions ; thus , itispossiblethatotherassaysforcell migrationmight revealmore signi ﬁ cant differences . Cluster1 also appeared to less effectively grow in soft agar as compared with cluster2 ( Fig . 6D , P ¼ 0 . 117 ) . Thatthisapparentdifferencedidnot reach statistical signi ﬁ cance may be due to the qualitative nature of the assay and its saturation at (cid:6) 300 colonies / well . Consistent with this , only 31 % of cluster 1 cell lines compared with 62 % of cluster 2 cell lines exhibited high growth ( i . e . , at > 300 colonies / well ) in soft agar ( P ¼ . 079 , two - sided Student t test ) . Together , these studies suggest that clustering of NSCLC cells based on functional criteria may be informative as to cancer cell properties . Clearly higher numbers of cell lines will need to be examined to con ﬁ rm these associations . A recent study has suggested a link between CD44 expression and KRAS - driven lung adenocarcinomas ( 52 ) . Given our ﬁ nding ofthesmallbutsigni ﬁ cantcorrelationbetweenCD44endocytosis and KRAS mutations ( Fig . 5 ) , the negative correlation between CD44 endocytosis and proliferation in 2D ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) , and the apparent differences in proliferation on soft agar between clusters 1 and 2 , we more closely examined uptake and surface expression of CD44 in the two clusters . We found that cluster 1 had signi ﬁ cantly lower clathrin - independent endocytic activity and correspondingly higher surface expression of both CD44 ( Fig . 6E and F ) and CD59 ( Supplementary Fig . S7A ) . In contrast , we did not detect systematic or signi ﬁ cant differences in the other endocytic activities or changes in surface expression of their markers ( Supplementary Fig . S7B and S7C ) between the two clusters . Together , these data suggest that selective changes in endocytic activities , in particular clathrin - independent endocyto - sis , can dynamically alter surface expression of cancer - related molecules and affect cellular processes that contribute to cancer aggressiveness . However , such changes do not appear to occur systematically across endocytic pathways or in all NSCLC cells . Furtherstudieswillbeneededtodeterminewhetherthesechangesaffectclinicaloutcomes . Discussion Endocytosis of cell surface receptors can potentially control many activities related to cancer cell proliferation and migration , including nutrient acquisition , cell – cell and cell – matrix adhe - sion , receptor tyrosine kinase , and G - protein – coupled receptor signaling . Moreover , many components of the endocytic machin - ery are mutated or have altered expression in a number of cancers ( 4 , 5 , 53 ) . Thus , it is generally assumed that endocytosis is somehow altered in cancer cells to enhance their proliferative and metastatic potential . Evidence in support of this concept derives primarily from analysis of the effects of perturbing speci ﬁ c endocytic pathways on signaling , proliferation , and / or migration incancercells ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 45 ) . Here , we soughtadditional support for this hypothesis through a more systematic and quantitative analysis of the endocytic activities of a large panel of NSCLC cell lines to determine whether there were consistent alterations in oneormoreendocyticpathwaythatmightbelinkedtochangesin cancer cell proliferation , including anchorage - independency , adhesion , or migration through a collagen matrix . We measured the uptake of four ligands via mechanistically distinct endocytic pathways in 29 independently isolated NSCLC cell lines and discovered a large degree of heterogeneity in these activities . Our results emphasize the inherent complexity and heterogeneity in cancer cell biology that can preclude drawing general conclusions from acute perturbation studies in single cell lines . Nonetheless , based on their overall endocytic properties , we could identify two phenotypically distinct clusters of NSCLC cell lines , which dif - fered in their preponderance of KRAS mutations , epithelial or mesenchymal gene signatures , 3D migration , and anchorage - independent growth . These data suggest that changes in overall Figure 4 . Summary of data for the activities of four distinct endocytic pathways in 29 NSCLC cell lines .

CAN - 15 - 0939 endocytic capacity might indeed in ﬂ uence cancer cell behavior and / or vice versa . Heterogeneity in NSCLC cell lines con ﬁ rms diversity of endocytic pathways The functions and activities of different endocytic pathways are frequently measured after selective perturbation of one or other pathway . However , the effects of these perturbations can partially overlap making it dif ﬁ cult to distinguish endocytic pathways , especiallyinthecaseofthelesswell - de ﬁ nedclathrin - independent mechanisms . Indeed , the relationship between CLIC - mediated uptake of CD44 and GPI - anchored proteins and the arf6 - depen - dent uptake of similar markers remains somewhat controversial ( 6 , 15 , 32 , 54 , 55 ) . Adding to this complexity , it has been suggested that there might be cross - talk between endocytic path - ways , such that inhibition of one might lead to upregulation of another . Such a reciprocal relationship has been recently sug - gested for CavME and CD44 uptake ( 56 ) . Finally , a recent study suggested that CME accounts for > 95 % of all bulk endocytosis , including that of the GPI - AP , CD59 ( 19 ) , and brought into question the physiologic relevance of alternate endocytic path - ways . Our ﬁ nding that at least three distinct endocytic pathways can be differentially up - or downregulated in an otherwise non - perturbed panel of NSCLC lines con ﬁ rms that these pathways , including two poorly de ﬁ ned clathrin - independent pathways mediating the uptake of CD59 and CD44 , respectively , can be differentially regulated and hence must be , at least in part , mechanistically independent . Endocytosis and cancer Unexpectedly , weobservedadecreaseinallendocyticpathways measured when we compared syngeneic normal HBEC cell lines with their tumorigenic counterparts . Having lower rates of endo - cytosis might bene ﬁ t the NSCLC cell lines by maintaining higher surface levels of important plasma membrane molecules , includ - ing those for signaling and adhesion . However , this pattern did not hold across all NSCLC lines , highlighting the genetic and mechanistic diversity of cancer . Moreover , it is likely that endo - cytic activities of cancer cells will be in ﬂ uenced by different signaling environments in vitro and in vivo . Previous work using siRNA knockdown of components of the endocytic machinery had suggested a link between CME and Figure 5 .

CAN - 15 - 0939 CavME and the ability of cancer cells to proliferate , adhere , and migrate . CME has been implicated in integrin ( 45 ) and receptor tyrosine kinases ( 57 ) endocytosis . In order for a cell to sustain directed forward migration , integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases , such as the EGFR , must be constantly internalized by CME and recycled to the leading edge of the cell . CavME has also been found to be important for the internalization of membrane - type 1 matrix metalloproteinase , which helps to degrade the ECM at the leading edge of a cell , ( 58 ) , as well as integrins ( 59 ) contributing to the disassembly of focal adhesions . Correspond - ingly , knockdown of Dyn2 in prostate cancer cells prevented cell invasion in 3D and in vivo ( 9 ) , and siRNA knockdown of Cav1 in NCI - H460 lung cancer cells causes an increased ability of these cells to migrate and invade in vitro ( 7 ) . Thus , we were surprised to see no correlation between CME or CavME endocytic activity and these cancer cell processes . This difference likely re ﬂ ects the effects of strong perturbation of these pathways as compared with the more subtle regulation and variations we observe in our panel of NSCLCcelllines . Itisalsopossiblethatratherthanglobalchanges in CME and CavME , changes in the endocytosis of speci ﬁ c cargo molecules not used here to measure these pathways could be selectively altered to affect migration , proliferation , and / or Figure 6 . Endocytic activities identify two phenotypically distinct clusters of NSCLC cell lines .

NSCLC cell lines in cluster 1 were enriched in those bearing KRAS mutations ( þ ) and exhibiting a mesenchymal phenotype ( M ) , whereas cells in cluster 2 were enriched in those exhibiting an epithelial phenotype ( E ) .

CAN - 15 - 0939 adhesion . For example , we detected an inverse relationship betweenCIEofCD44andproliferationin2Dthatwaslessevident when measuring CIE of CD59 . Better classi ﬁ cation of NSCLCs would facilitate the diagnosis and treatment plans for individual patients . Numerous studies have applied unsupervised clustering methods to classify NSCLC cell lines based on their diverse patterns of mRNA or protein expression , epigenetic modi ﬁ cations , etc . ( 47 – 49 ) . Here , for the ﬁ rst time , we apply this analysis to their measured diversity in a cell biological activity , endocytosis . Interestingly , despite our inability to correlate differences in individual endocytic activities with other cancer - related cellular properties ( e . g . , migration , adhesion , proliferation ) , hierarchical clustering based on the diversity of their collective endocytic activities identi ﬁ ed two distinct NSCLC cell line clusters that co - cluster with other can - cer - related properties . Cluster 1 appeared enriched in cell lines bearing KRAS mutations , a mesenchymal phenotype , an enhanced ability to migrate in collagen , reduced ability to grow in soft agar , and reduced CIE , in particular of CD44 , leading its increased expression on the cell surface . Consistent with these ﬁ ndings , recent studies reported a role for CD44 in mediating NSCLC proliferation downstream of KRAS ( 52 ) . It will be impor - tant to extend these analyses to other NCSLC cells to test the validity of these linkages and also to determine their functional and / or clinical relevance . Moreover , applying this approach to other NCSLC lines will enhance our statistical power and allow us to assess the functional signi ﬁ cance of the " outliers " we detect among this initial sampling of 29 cell lines . Further work is necessary to directly explore the role and regulation of endocytosis in cancer progression . That many com - ponents of the endocytic machinery are dysregulated or mutated in cancer suggests a functional link . Our results suggest that dynamic regulation of the surface expression of important cancer molecules through endocytosis may , in some cases , contribute to the malignant properties of cancer cells . However , they also highlight cancer cell heterogeneity and reveal that the functional relationship between endocytic activities and cell migration , adhesion , and proliferation may be more complex than suggested by perturbation analyses of single cell lines .
