Atomic force microscope – based single - molecule force spec - troscopy was employed to measure sequence - dependent mechanical properties of DNA by stretching individual DNA double strands attached between a gold surface and an AFM tip . We discovered that in l - phage DNA the previously reported B - S transition , where ‘S’ represents an over - stretched conformation , at 65 pN is followed by a nonequi - librium melting transition at 150 pN . During this transition the DNA is split into single strands that fully recombine upon relaxation . The sequence dependence was investigated in comparative studies with poly ( dG - dC ) and poly ( dA - dT ) DNA . Both the B - S and the melting transition occur at significantly lower forces in poly ( dA - dT ) compared to poly ( dG - dC ) . We made use of the melting transition to pre - pare single poly ( dG - dC ) and poly ( dA - dT ) DNA strands that upon relaxation reannealed into hairpins as a result of their self - complementary sequence . The unzipping of these hair - pins directly revealed the base pair – unbinding forces for G - C to be 20 ± 3 pN and for A - T to be 9 ± 3 pN . With the development of piconewton instrumentation , mechanical experiments with individual molecules allow direct measurements of both inter - and intramolecular forces 1 – 5 . Conformational transitions in polymers 6 , 7 and unfolding of proteins 8 – 11 have been reported . Stretching experiments of l - DNA 12 – 14 have revealed a highly cooperative transition at 65 – 70 pN , where B - DNA is converted into a new overstretched con - formation called S - DNA . Theoretical descriptions and mol - ecular - dynamics simulations have given insight into this process 15 – 17 . Unzipping experiments with single DNA mole - cules have been performed , and the correlation between the resulting force profile and the average G - C content in the strand demonstrated the potential of this kind of experiments for large - scale sequencing 18 , 19 . In this study we employed single - molecule force spectroscopy based on atomic force microscope ( AFM ) technology 20 to show that the mechanics of DNA overstretching is sequence depen - dent . Furthermore , we used this technique to measure directly the base - pairing forces of G - C and A - T nucleotides . From a layer of DNA molecules adsorbed on a gold surface , an individual DNA strand was picked up with an AFM tip by applying a contact force of several nanonewtons ( nN ) . Upon retraction , the DNA strand was stretched between gold surface and tip . The resulting force was measured through the deflec - tion of the cantilever using optical lever detection . This attach - ment protocol has been shown to be applicable to a broad range of molecules and results in stable attachment under forces of up to a nanonewton 6 – 8 . In the extension / relaxation cycle of a 1 . 5 µm - long double stranded segment of digested l - DNA ( Fig . 1 a ) , the well - known highly cooperative B - S transition can be observed at 65 pN . During this transition the helix elongates by nearly a factor of Fig . 1 Force - induced melting transition in l - DNA . a , Stretching ( red ) and relaxation ( blue ) curve of a 1 . 5 - m m - long segment of a l - BstE II digested DNA molecule .

Inset : low - force range of a relaxation curve of l - DNA previously split in the melt - ing transition ( blue curve ) . The black curve is a fit according to the freely jointed chain model with an additional segment elasticity using the same parameters that have been determined for ssDNA 12 ( Kuhn length 8 Å , molecular spring constant per unit length 800 pN ) . b , Superposition of four extension traces of the same molecule taken at different pulling speeds ( red , 3 m m s – 1 ; green , 1 . 5 m m s – 1 ; blue , 0 . 7 m m s – 1 ; black , 0 . 15 m m s – 1 ) . Inset : a sequence of three stretching ( red ) and relaxation ( blue ) cycles performed each time on the same molecule ( pulling speed : 0 . 25 m m s – 1 ) . Partial melt - ing of the double helix occurs during the B - S transition ( first trace ) and is complete after the melting transition ( second and third trace ) . Reannealing of the two single strands leads to the characteristic shape of the relaxation traces . a b © 1999 Nature America Inc . • http : / / structbio . nature . com © 1999 N a t u r e A m e r i ca I n c . • h tt p : / / s t r u c t b i o . n a t u r e . c o m letters nature structural biology • volume 6 number 4 • april 1999 347 two 12 – 14 . However , at forces of ~ 150 pN a new transition occurs , after which the force increases drastically upon further exten - sion . Upon relaxation the force drops continuously and exhibits a marked hysteresis , indicating that a massive topolog - ical change occurs during this high force transition . A deforma - tion trace of a ssDNA molecule that is free of hysteresis ( black curve ) was superimposed on the relaxation curve . The two curves are virtually indistinguishable . In fact , a fit of a polymer elasticity model to the low - force regime of the relaxation trace of a dsDNA molecule split in the high - force transition yields exactly the same parameters found for ssDNA by Smith et al . 12 , who obtained ssDNA by denaturing dsDNA in distilled water or formaldehyde ( Fig . 1 a , inset ) . This agreement further cor - roborates our interpretation that the high - force transition is a force - induced melting transition in which the double helix is split into single strands . Since the attachment forces for a single strand of DNA in our experiments hold up to more than a nanonewton , polymer elasticity models can now also be tested at high forces . The worm - like chain model and the freely jointed chain model , including an additional elastic modulus of 800 pN , yield equal - ly good results in a force range up to 100 pN ( Fig . 1 a , inset ) . However , at higher forces these models fail to describe the mea - sured force extension curves . It seems likely that quantum - mechanical ab initio calculations could provide new insights into the nonlinear enthalpic elasticity at high forces . The high attachment forces also show that the covalent bonds within a DNA strand are stable up to forces of at least a nanonewton , which is considerably higher than the 476 pN estimated by Bensimon et al . 14 In some cases , ( for example , the trace shown in Fig . 1 a ) , per - manent conversion to ssDNA occurs upon overstretching . It is possible that in this case a break in the DNA strand that melts off facilitates complete detachment of the strand and renders reannealing impossible . In many relaxation traces , however , reannealing into a complete double helix can be observed . In such a case ( Fig . 1 b ) , repeated splitting and reannealing can be performed several hundred times , using the same molecule . When four stretching curves recorded with the same molecule at different pulling speeds are superimposed ( Fig . 1 b ) , an interesting thermodynamic difference between the B - S transi - tion and the melting transition can be observed : the force of the B - S transition proves to be independent of pulling speeds , whereas the melting transition exhibits a pronounced speed dependence . This shows that the B - S transition is an equilibri - um process within the time scale of our experiment , whereas the melting transition occurs in nonequilibrium . In other words the rearrangement of the helix in the B - S transition occurs much faster than reannealing of the split strands . A series of three extension / relaxation cycles , always performed on the same stretch of l - DNA , is depicted in the inset of Fig . 1 b . If the molecule is not stretched beyond the B - S coexistence plateau , the B - S transition is essentially reversible and shows only a small melting hysteresis ( first trace ) . This small hysteresis may be due to partial melting of ( presumably A - T - rich ) regions in the DNA , as was already suggested by Smith and colleagues 12 . As soon as the molecule is stretched beyond the melting transi - tion , the relaxation trace shows a pronounced reannealing hys - teresis . The profile of the reannealing pattern is similar in traces recorded on the same DNA stretch ( Fig . 1b , inset , traces 2 and 3 ) but varies from stretch to stretch . This suggests that the reannealing profile is sequence dependent . To obtain a more detailed understanding of the sequence dependence of the mechanical properties of DNA , we investigated synthetic constructs of double - stranded poly ( dG - dC ) as well as poly ( dA - dT ) . We recorded extension traces where the molecules were stretched up to the maximum attachment force ( Fig . 2 ) . Upon detachment the lever snaps back to its resting position at zero force . The different sequences exhibit pronounced differ - ences in their conformational transitions . For double - stranded poly ( dG - dC ) ( Fig . 2 a ) the B - S transition occurs at 65 pN , just as in l - DNA , while the melting transition is shifted toward higher forces starting at ~ 250 pN and leading into the single - stranded conformation at 350 pN . For poly ( dA - dT ) DNA ( Fig . 2 b ) , howev - er , the B - S transition force is reduced to 35 pN and the double strand begins melting during this B - S transition , so that an addi - tional melting transition can no longer be observed . This result can be explained by considering that the mechanical energy deposited in the double strand during the B - S transition ( the area enclosed by the stretching and relaxation trace in Fig . 1 a ) already exceeds the base - pairing energy of poly ( dA - dT ) . When dsDNA of alternating G - C or A - T sequence is over - stretched until the double helix melts , the resulting single strands can pair with themselves because of their self - complementarity . Consequently , the free strand , which is split off during the melt - ing transition , should pair immediately into hairpins ( see Fig . 3 a ) . Thus reannealing of the two strands will be prevented upon relaxation of the strand that remains attached to the tip ; instead , the attached strand will form a hairpin as well . Upon re - extension of the same molecule , the hairpin will be unzipped . This mechanism thus allows the measurement of the sequence - specific base - pairing forces in dsDNA . The sequence of three extension / relaxation cycles of the same molecule of duplex poly ( dG - dC ) in Fig . 3 b exhibits exactly this hairpin formation . In the first cycle the molecule is extended only into the B - S transition . Extension and relaxation traces exhibit a small amount of hysteresis . Despite this small hystere - sis , no permanent conversion of the molecule has occurred dur - Fig . 2 The mechanical compliance of DNA strongly depends on the specif - ic base pairing in the double helix . a , For double - stranded poly ( dG - dC ) DNA the B - S transition occurs at 65 pN ( see arrows ) , just as in l - DNA , while the melting transition is raised to 300 pN , compared to 150 pN in l - DNA . b , In duplex poly ( dA - dT ) DNA the force of the B - S transition is reduced to 35 pN and the strands melt during this transition , so that no distinct melting transition can be observed ( see Fig . 3 ) . a b © 1999 Nature America Inc . • http : / / structbio . nature . com © 1999 N a t u r e A m e r i ca I n c . • h tt p : / / s t r u c t b i o . n a t u r e . c o m letters 348 nature structural biology • volume 6 number 4 • april 1999 ing this first cycle , as can be seen by noting that the extension trace of the second cycle is virtually identical to that of the first cycle . However , a small step at ~ 20 pN can be observed already in the first cycle , indicating a slight structural difference as com - pared to a fully double - stranded molecule ( as in Fig . 2 a ) . In the second force plot the molecule is partly extended into the melt - ing transition . Here the relaxation trace shows a shortening of the B - S transition plateau and the appearance of a new plateau at a force of 20 pN . The length d hp ( hairpin ) of this new plateau is approximately twice as long as the length decrease d B - S in the B - S transition between the extension and relaxation curves . This is exactly what one expects if hairpins are formed . The 2 : 1 ratio is consistent with the contour length of ssDNA being approximately twice as long as the B - S plateau in dsDNA ( see Fig . 1 a ) . Therefore , we conclude that the new 20 pN plateau in the relaxation trace corresponds to the formation of hairpins that are unzipped in the subsequent extension trace . The observation that hairpin formation occurs at a force that is well below the reannealing force of the double strand ( Fig . 1 b , inset ) supports our assumption that hairpins are formed in the free strand as soon as it is melted off , thus blocking reannealing with the strand that is stretched . Consequently , upon relaxation less of the remaining DNA can recover to double - stranded con - formation , so that it has to pair with itself and form hairpins as well . In the last plot ( Fig . 3 b ) , the same molecule is over - stretched even further and again the 20 pN plateau grows at the expense of the B - S transition at a ratio of 2 : 1 . It can be seen in the second and third traces ( Fig . 3 b ) that the 20 pN plateau appears at exactly the same force in both the stretching and relaxation cycles . Thus the zipping / unzipping transition occurs in thermodynamic equilibrium 18 , 19 . As a conse - quence , the zipping / unzipping forces do not depend on the pulling speed , as binding and unbinding of base pairs takes place on a much faster time scale than that of our experiment . It is to be expected , however , that in future experiments , using higher pulling speeds , a transition to a nonequilibrium regime will be observed , in which forces become speed dependent 22 . The lack of hysteresis in the plateau also shows that the hydrodynamic forces acting against the rotation of the B - hairpin during zipping and unzipping are much weaker than the base - pairing forces . The same hairpin formation occurs in poly ( dA - dT ) DNA ( Fig . 3 c ) . The first extension / relaxation cycle shows the hairpin plateau of a DNA strand that already had partially melted dur - ing a previous extension . In the second trace additional duplex DNA is converted to ssDNA , forming hairpins upon relaxation . Here the zipping / unzipping plateau occurs at 9 pN . The hystere - sis between extension and relaxation traces in this cycle shows that melting of the double strand in poly ( dA - dT ) occurs during the B - S transition . From variations of unzipping force with average G - C content of l - DNA , Essevaz - Roulet et al . 18 have extrapolated values for the unzipping forces of pure A - T and pure G - C base pairing of 10 pN and 15 pN , respectively . The differences between these estimates and unzipping forces of F G - C = 20 ± 3 pN and F A - T = 9 ± 3 pN pre - sented here can be understood in the light of measurements of base - pairing free energies 23 . Free energy depends not only on the type of base pairing ( A - T or G - C ) , but also on the sequence of bases itself . A poly ( dA ) poly ( dT ) duplex , for example , is much more stable than a poly ( dA - dT ) duplex like the one used in the experiments presented here . Knowing the unzipping forces of well - defined model sequences is thus an important step for large - scale sequencing of individual DNA molecules in mechanical experiments . Moreover , nano - mechanical experiments of the kind presented here can provide insight into a variety of biologi - cally important structures like RNA secondary structure or RNA – DNA hybrids . Fig . 3 Direct measurement of base - pairing forces . a , The self - complementarity of poly ( dG - dC ) and poly ( dA - dT ) allows for hairpin formation within the two DNA strands . After force - induced melting of the double helix , base - pairing forces can be directly measured in the strand attached to the tip . b , Three repeated extension ( red ) and relaxation ( blue ) curves of one poly ( dG - dC ) molecule . In the first extension / relaxation cycle , the molecule is extended into the B - S transition . This process is essentially reversible . In the second cycle the molecule is extended partly into the melting transition , which leads to a shortening of the B - S plateau and the appearance of a new plateau at F G - C = 20 pN in the relaxation trace , caused by hairpin forma - tion . This 20 pN plateau reappears as a hairpin - unzipping plateau in the extension trace of the third cycle . Here the molecule is overstretched even more , resulting in further growth of the 20 pN plateau at the expense of the B - S plateau in the relaxation trace . c , For poly ( dA - dT ) DNA the zip - ping / unzipping force is F A - T = 9 pN . The two plots show the stretching ( red ) and relaxation ( blue ) of a molecule that had already formed intrastrand hairpins during a previous stretching . The first cycle shows zipping and unzipping of the hairpins . In the second trace the double strand is further converted into intrastrand hairpins . The double helix starts to melt during the B - S transition . a b c © 1999 Nature America Inc . • http : / / structbio . nature . com © 1999 N a t u r e A m e r i ca I n c . • h tt p : / / s t r u c t b i o . n a t u r e . c o m letters nature structural biology • volume 6 number 4 • april 1999 349 Methods Sample preparation . l - BstE II digested DNA ( length distribution 117 – 8 , 454 bp ) was purchased from Sigma ( Deisenhofen , Germany ) . Duplex poly ( dG - dC ) ( average length : 1 , 257 bp ) and poly ( dA - dT ) ( average length : 5 , 090 bp ) were purchased from Pharmacia ( Freiburg , Germany ) . In all preparation steps and exper - iments , Tris buffer containing 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 1 mM EDTA was used . DNA was allowed to adsorb onto a freshly evaporated gold surface from a 100 m l drop of a 100 m g ml – 1 DNA solution ( 24 h incubation , ambient temperature ) . Alternatively , a 100 m l drop of a 100 m g ml – 1 DNA solution was allowed to dry on the gold surface . Before beginning the experiment the sample was rinsed with buffer . Experiments were conducted at ambient tem - perature ( 20 o C ) . Single - stranded DNA . Single - stranded DNA was obtained by dialyzing double - stranded l - BstE II digested DNA against Millipore water . The sample was prepared as described . All prepa - ration steps were carried out in Millipore water . Force measure - ments were conducted in Tris buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 ) . Force measurements . DNA molecules were picked up with an untreated Si 3 N 4 AFM tip ( Microlevers , Park Scientific Instruments ) . It has been shown in various studies that this nonspecific attach - ment holds forces of up to a nN 6 – 8 . Because the DNA molecules are not anchored at the ends , the apparent length of the molecule picked up varies . The extension of the molecule can be controlled with sub - angstrom precision with a piezo translator , and the force is measured by the deflection of the AFM cantilever spring . The spring constant of each lever was calibrated by measuring the amplitude of the thermal fluctuations 24 , 25 . Spring constants varied between 7 and 11 pN nm – 1 ; the resonance frequency of the can - tilevers in buffer was between 700 Hz and 1 kHz . The measure - ments were carried out on a custom - built AFM . The sampling rate was 60 kHz . Each force curve consisted of 4 , 096 steps , and we recorded 10 – 200 data points per step depending on the desired pulling speed . A box - smoothing window ( width : 20 steps ) was applied to the data shown . Correspondence should be addressed to H . E .
