Caveolae - mediated transcytosis of macromolecules is critical for main - taining vascular homeostasis by regulating the oncotic pressure gradient and tissue delivery of drugs , vita - mins , lipids and ions . Entrapment of cargo within caveolae induces activation of signalling cascades leading to caveolae fission and internalization . Activation of Src tyrosine kinase is an early and essential step that triggers detachment of loaded caveolae from the plasma membrane . In this review , we examine how Src - mediated phosphorylation regulates caveolae - mediated transport by orchestrating the localization and activ - ity of essential proteins of the endocytic machinery to regulate caveolae formation and fission .

Loss of this barrier function results in patho - physiological conditions including oedema [ 1 ] . Caveolae - mediated transcytosis is the primary means by which plasma macromolecules cross the endothelium . Caveolae , the omega - shaped plasmalemmal vesicles of 50 – 80 nm in diameter [ 2 ] , represent > 95 % of the endothelial cell vesicles [ 3 ] . Transcytosis occurs by the activation of fission and endocytosis of caveolae from the apical membrane [ 3 – 5 ] , followed by migration of detached vesicles to the basolateral membrane where they fuse and release their contents into the interstitial space [ 6 – 12 ] . The main structural unit and biological marker of caveolae is the 20 – 22 kD integral membrane Caveolae Review Series Guest Editor : R . V . Stan * Correspondence to : Richard D .

To date , several different caveolin iso - forms have been identified : caveolin - 1 (cid:2) , caveolin - 1 (cid:3) , caveolin - 2 (cid:2) , caveolin - 2 (cid:3) , caveolin - 2 (cid:4) and cave - olin - 3 [ 13 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Caveolin - 1 and - 2 are ubiquitous - ly expressed , while caveolin - 3 is confined to muscle cells [ 14 – 16 ] . The (cid:2) and (cid:3) isoforms of caveolin - 1 result from alternative splicing from a single gene ; the (cid:3) form is 32 amino acids shorter than the (cid:2) form [ 14 ] . Caveolin - 1 is required for the biogenesis of non - muscle caveolae since the overexpression of cave - olin - 1 in cells that lack endogenous caveolin - 1 results in the de novoformation of caveolae [ 17 , 18 ] . In cells that loose caveolin - 1 expression during trans - formation , caveolae are no longer present [ 19 ] . Moreover , endothelium and adipose tissue of mice defective in caveolin - 1 are devoid of caveolae [ 20 – 24 ] . Suppression of caveolin - 1 expression by siRNA leads to a dramatic decrease in the number of caveolae in endothelial cells , which returns to normal following recovery of caveolin - 1 expression [ 25 ] . By tracing the movement of labelled albumin and other molecules from the luminal side of the Fig . 1 Phosphorylation map of the caveolin family of proteins . Caveolins are highly homologous and conserved proteins . All isoforms contain membrane - spanning , oligomerization and caveolin - scaffolding domains . ( A ) Caveolin - 1 (cid:2) isoform consists of 178 amino acids with phosphorylation sites at tyrosine 14 and serine 80 . Caveolin - 1 (cid:3) isoform lacks the first 31 amino acids , and thus it does not contain the tyrosine phosphorylation site . Residues 75 – 158 ( part of scaffolding domain , mem - brane - spanning domain , and most of the C - terminus ) are involved in binding Dynamin 2 . Scaffolding and membrane - span - ning domains of caveolin - 1 also participate in homo - oligomerization and formation of heteroligomers with caveolin - 2 . ( B ) Caveolin - 2 is ~ 50 % homologues to caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 (cid:2) isoform contains 162 amino acids with phosphorylation sites at tyrosines 19 and 27 , and serines 23 and 36 . Caveolin - 2 (cid:3) isoform , produced by alternative splicing of mRNA , is truncat - ed by 13 N - terminal amino acids , while no information is yet available about the phosphorylation of the caveolin - 2 (cid:2) isoform . ( C ) Caveolin - 3 is a muscle - specific isoform , which contains 151 amino acids and is very homologous to caveolin - 1 . No phosphorylation sites have been demonstrated for caveolin - 3 to date .

Vol 11 , No 6 , 2007 1241 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd endothelium by electron microscopy [ 9 , 26 – 28 ] , it was shown that caveolae are involved in the transcel - lular transport of molecules through endothelial cells . In fibroblasts derived from caveolin - 1 knockout mouse embryos , uptake of fluorescent - labelled albu - min was abolished [ 24 ] . Both electron microscopy and radio - iodinated albumin uptake studies con - firmed the failure of caveolin - 1 knockout mouse endothelium to internalize albumin in vivo , further supporting the importance of caveolae in the trans - port of macromolecules [ 29 ] . However , mice lacking caveolae are viable and the albumin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid of caveolin - 1 knockout mice is not different from that of wild - type mice [ 20 ] . It was subsequently suggested that in the absence of cave - olin - 1 , elevated levels of nitric oxide ( NO ) leads to destabilization of the normally restrictive paracellular pathway , thus compensating for the loss of caveolae by generating shorter and more permeable transendothelial junctions [ 25 , 29 ] . Despite our cur - rent understanding of the importance of caveolae - mediated transcytosis in maintenance of the structur - al integrity of the endothelial barrier , the signalling mechanisms by which caveolin - 1 and transcytosis in general regulate endothelial barrier integrity have not been well established . Src signalling in caveolae - mediated endocytosis Selective internalization of certain proteins occurs within caveolae upon ligation of cell surface recep - tors [ 10 , 30 – 33 ] . We and others have shown that endocytosis via caveolae is critically dependent on stimulation of tyrosine kinase signalling [ 10 , 31 , 34 – 41 ] . Dephosphorylation may also be involved in the control of caveolae - mediated endocytosis [ 34 , 40 ] . However , the mechanism of caveolae formation and release from the plasma membrane in response to caveolin - 1 phosphorylation remains unknown . Early on , studies showed that the binding of some proteins to their receptors induces receptor cluster - ing in caveolae , which in turn activates phosphoryla - tion cascades [ 31 , 34 , 36 ] . Clustering of albumin receptor gp60 or alkaline phosphatase , induced by cross - linking with antibodies , is sufficient for activa - tion of signalling events associated with caveolae internalization [ 31 , 34 , 40 ] . Virions of SV40 virus , another caveolae marker , initially do not bind to cave - olae , but once ligated translocate to caveolae [ 36 , 42 , 43 ] . Major histocompatability complex - I ( MHC - I ) , the surface receptor for SV40 , also moves to caveo - lae upon cross - linking with antibodies [ 44 ] . Treatment with nystatin , a drug that sequesters cholesterol and flattens caveolae , does not inhibit SV40 binding to the cell surface , but impairs SV40 - induced signalling and endocytosis [ 36 ] , as well as endocytosis of albu - min and glycosphingolipids [ 39 ] . These studies sug - gest that receptor clustering and movement into caveolae is crucial for the induction of endocytosis . Caveolae are also known to scaffold and concen - trate signalling molecules , and entrapment of cargo in caveolae is required for initiation of signalling . As mentioned already , inhibition of phosphatases aug - ments caveolar internalization whereas inhibition of kinases decreases it , implying that phosphorylation events play an essential role in the mechanism of caveolae - mediated endocytosis . While searching for the kinases that could initiate this phosphorylation cascade , it became apparent that Src family non - receptor tyrosine kinases , Src and Fyn , are activated immediately after addition of cargo [ 31 , 40 ] . Tiruppathi et al . , as well as others [ 39 , 40 ] showed that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors tyrphostin A , genis - tein and PP2 block albumin uptake . Additionally , expression of dn - Src ( dominant - negative Src , Y527F / K295M ) inhibited gp60 - mediated internaliza - tion of caveolae in endothelial cells [ 10 , 41 ] . Furthermore , a peptide encoding the caveolin - 1 scaf - folding domain ( CSD ) dose - dependently inhibited the auto - activation of purified Src kinases ( c - Src and Fyn ) [ 45 ] and also decreased transcytosis of albumin by 50 % when introduced to the cells [ 46 ] . Finally , down - regulation of Src with siRNA induced aggrega - tion of caveolae and a decrease in the mobility of caveolae , which resulted in defective endocytosis of SV40 in HeLa cells [ 47 , 48 ] . A recent screening for kinases important for caveolae - mediated endocyto - sis revealed a large number of these molecules are involved in co - ordinating caveolae internalization [ 48 ] . The present review focuses on Src family kinases as they represent the most well studied signalling mech - anism involved in caveolae - mediated endocytosis . The mechanism by which receptor clustering in caveolae activates Src kinases is not completely understood . Activation of Src kinase and Src - mediat - ed phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 and 1242 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd dynamin - 2 represent early and essential steps in this cascade ( Fig . 2 ) . The phosphorylation state of these proteins may regulate their three - dimensional struc - ture , activity , localization and set of binding partners . Therefore , the primary function of Src in caveolae - mediated endocytosis has been proposed to be the regulation and assembly of multi - protein complexes responsible for caveolae fission and internalization [ 10 ] . Treatment of bovine lung endothelial cells with pertussis toxin or a dominant negative G (cid:2) i construct encoding the carboxyl - terminal 11 amino acids of G (cid:2) i inhibited endocytosis of iodinated albumin and vesicle formation induced by gp60 cross - linking in endothelial cells , illustrating that caveolar internaliza - tion may be regulated by a Gi - linked pathway [ 10 ] . Also , both activation and inhibition of G (cid:3)(cid:4) had a pro - found effect on Src activation and caveolae - mediated endocytosis of cholera toxin subunit B and albumin [ 40 ] , suggesting that heterotrimeric G - protein Gi is upstream of Src in the signalling cascade initiated by albumin which is then internalized and transport - ed in caveolae . When Src is activated , a number of proteins con - centrated on the cytoplasmic surface of caveolae are Fig . 2 Src - dependent signalling of caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Caveolae are the primary vesicular transporters or ' car - riers ' in endothelial cells . Clustering of various receptors , for example albumin binding protein gp60 , initiates endocytosis viacaveolae by associating with caveolin - 1 and activating Src - family tyrosine kinase signalling ( A , B ) . Caveolin - 1 plays a central role as it serves a scaffolding function for components of the signalling machinery responsible for endocytosis and also stabilizes caveolae at the membrane . Gi / (cid:3)(cid:4) - linked Src - family kinase activation ( viaautophosphorylation of Src Y416 ) ( B ) in turn phosphorylates tyrosine residues on caveolin - 1 ( Y14 ) and caveolin - 2 ( Y19 , Y27 ) ( C ) , which may destabilize membrane - associated hetero - oligomers ( C ) , and the GTPase dynamin - 2 ( Y231 , Y597 ) which is thought to ' pinch ' caveolae from the plasma membrane ( D ) . Src - dependent phosphorylation is hypothesized to be the trigger that activates caveolar fission by decreasing the rigid structure of the caveolar coat and activating dynamin pinchase function . J .

Caveolin - 1 , perhaps the primary substrate of Src , is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 [ 45 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . It is implied by several studies that phos - phorylation of caveolin - 1 is essential for caveolae - mediated endocytosis ; the possible role phospho - caveolin - 1 plays in this process will be discussed below . Caveolin - 2 , which forms hetero - oligomers with caveolin - 1 , represents another Src substrate on caveolae . Caveolin - 2 does not appear to be essential for caveolae formation , since caveolin - 2 knockout mice were reported to have normal non - muscle caveolae [ 49 ] . Additionally , in the absence of caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 not only fails to form oligomers , but is also unable to incorporate into lipid rafts , emphasizing the role of caveolin - 1 in proper function and localization of cave - olin - 2 in vivo [ 50 ] . However , caveolin - 2 appears to be involved in the regulation of caveolae size since co - expression with caveolin - 1 in insect cells lacking endogenous caveolins leads to the formation of smaller and more uniform vesicles than those formed by caveolin - 1 alone [ 51 ] . Formation of free cytoplas - mic caveolae ( i . e . , vesicles that have detached from the plasma membrane ) in HepG2 cells that do not express endogenous caveolins was dependent on co - expression of caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 [ 52 ] . Another group showed that caveolae formed by caveolin - 1 alone lack the characteristic neck struc - ture and were not connected to the plasma mem - brane [ 53 ] , suggesting that expression of both cave - olin - 1 and caveolin - 2 is necessary for the formation of functional caveolae . In the same study , the authors proposed that caveolin - 2 phosphorylation on serines 23 and 36 regulates the attachment of caveolae to the plasma membrane [ 53 ] . Caveolin - 2 also contains two tyrosines that can be phosphorylated by Src : tyrosine 19 and 27 [ 54 , 55 ] . In NIH3T3 cells , cave - olin - 2 phosphorylated on tyrosine 19 localizes main - ly to the cell borders , whereas caveolin - 2 phosphory - lated on tyrosine 27 was observed in small puncta throughout the membane and cytosol [ 55 ] . Despite different cellular localization , both phosphorylated forms of caveolin - 2 dissociate from high molecular weight caveolin - 1 oligomers but remain in lipid rafts [ 54 , 55 ] . However , there are no data on the impor - tance of caveolin - 2 or its phosphorylated forms in caveolae internalization . It may be possible , by dissoci - ating from caveolin - 1 oligomers upon phosphorylation , that caveolin - 2 participates in the regulated fission of caveolae . Also , since caveolin - 2 is only 36 % homolo - gous to caveolin - 1 [ 50 ] , its tyrosine - phosphorylated forms can recruit signalling molecules distinct from those recruited by phosphorylated caveolin - 1 [ 54 ] . Another target of Src shown to be critical to the regulation of caveolae - mediated endocytosis is the large molecular weight GTPase dynamin - 2 , which mediates fission of caveolae from the plasma mem - brane [ 40 , 41 , 56 – 58 ] . Src phosphorylation of dynamin at Tyr 231 and Tyr 597 increases its GTPase activity , assembly into oligomers [ 59 , 60 ] , and asso - ciation with caveolin - 1 at the plasma membrane [ 41 , 61 ] . Dynamin - 2 with mutated sites of Src phosphory - lation , at tyrosine 231 and 597 , fails to migrate to the membrane and also has a reduced ability to bind caveolin - 1 [ 41 ] . Such binding , which was recently shown to be direct [ 63 ] , is required for caveolae - mediated endocytosis of albumin and cholera toxin [ 41 ] . Interestingly , SV40 - induced internalization of caveolae was also shown to be dependent on tyro - sine kinase activity [ 36 ] and recruitment of dynamin to the membrane [ 37 ] . Dynamin - 2 localizes to the neck of caveolae and mediates their release from the plasma membrane [ 56 , 62 ] , which is supported by studies that showed expression of the GTPase - defective dynamin mutant ( K44A ) or microinjection of antibodies against dynamin - 2 prevented caveolae - dependent internal - ization of cholera toxin subunit B , albumin and glycosphingolipid [ 39 , 41 , 56 ] . Potential role of Src - mediated phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 in caveolae - mediated endocytosis Caveolin - 1 is a well - known substrate of Src [ 31 , 40 , 64 – 68 ] . Src phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 occurs within the extreme N - terminal region , between residues 6 and 26 which contains three tyrosine residues at positions 6 , 14 and 25 . Studies involving in vitro phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 - derived syn - thetic peptides and site - directed mutagenesis revealed that Tyr 14 is the primary residue phosphory - lated by Src [ 45 ] . Therefore , only caveolin - 1 (cid:2) , which contains residues 1 - 178 , can undergo tyrosine phos - phorylation since caveolin - 1 (cid:3) only contains residues 32 – 178 ( Fig . 1 ) . The initial approach to understand the role of the caveolin - 1 N - terminus included comparisons between (cid:2) and (cid:3) caveolin - 1 isoforms . Although dif - ferent by just 32 amino acids , caveolin - 1 isoforms play non - redundant roles in zebrafish development 1244 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd [ 69 ] . A recent study also detected an alternative pro - moter in the caveolin - 1 gene , suggesting that cave - olin - 1 isoforms can be produced by mRNA splicing or perhaps transcribed from two distinct mRNA tran - scripts [ 70 ] . By tracking the level of both mRNA and protein in mouse lungs , it was shown that caveolin - 1 (cid:2) is expressed earlier in development and predom - inates in endothelial cells , while caveolin - 1 (cid:3) is expressed primarily in epithelial cells and at a later stage of development [ 70 ] . Within each cell , the distri - bution of caveolin - 1 (cid:2) and - 1 (cid:3) isoforms only partially overlaps . For example , it was shown that an (cid:2) - isoform specific antibody stains micropatches throughout the cell , whereas a non - selective caveolin - 1 antibody that recognizes both (cid:2) and (cid:3) caveolin - 1 isoforms addi - tionally stains cell borders [ 14 ] . Another study sug - gested that there are different populations of caveo - lae and that the ratio of caveolin - 1 (cid:2) to caveolin - 1 (cid:3) was greater in deeply invaginated caveolae [ 52 ] . These studies lead to the proposal that the (cid:2) - isoform possesses a greater internalization potential than the (cid:3) - isoform . Different approaches have been used to study the functional role of caveolin - 1 (cid:2) phosphorylation in cave - olae - mediated endocytosis . Staining of normal rat tis - sues with an antibody specific to phospho - caveolin - 1 ( Y14 ) revealed that in vivo , caveolin - 1 is phosphory - lated in endothelial cells but not in pericytes , fibrob - lasts and other cells abundant in caveolin - 1 [ 35 ] . These data correlate with the constant engagement of endothelial cells in the endocytosis and transcyto - sis of macromolecules . In cultured cells , vanadate , an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases , increases the level of caveolin - 1 phosphorylation and also stimulates its translocation from peripheral membrane patches to intracellular vesicles [ 35 , 65 , 71 ] , enhancing the internalization of albumin [ 40 ] . Interestingly , co - transfection of v - Src , which is consti - tutively active , induces both caveolae internalization and aggregation . Phosphorylation of additional tyrosines in caveolin - 1 by v - Src was suggested as an explanation for the differences in response to vana - date versusv - Src [ 65 ] . Thus , the N - terminus of cave - olin - 1 , where tyrosine 14 is located , seems to be crit - ical for caveolae internalization . This point is strengthened by observations that in CV - 1 cells expressing caveolin - 1 with its N - terminus blocked by a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tag , SV40 inter - nalization was attenuated , while cells transfected with caveolin - 1 tagged with GFP at the C - terminus showed normal SV40 endocytosis [ 43 ] . A recent study conducted in epithelial cells illustrated that the Src - dependent increase in the level of caveolin - 1 phosphorylation upon epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) treatment corresponded to caveolae formation and internalization [ 72 ] . In the same study , the authors also provided evidence that caveolae formation in response to EGF was dependent on caveolin - 1 phosphorylation since a phosphorylation - defective caveolin - 1 mutant containing tyrosine 14 substituted with phenylalanine ( Y14F ) was not able to form visi - ble caveolae . Moreover , we observed that expression of Y14F caveolin - 1 mutant in endothelial cells signifi - cantly reduced endocytosis and transcytosis of albu - min [ 23 , 46 ] suggesting the caveolin - 1 N - terminus plays a regulatory role and its phosphorylation by Src kinase may be crucial for caveolae formation and detachment from the membrane . Caveolin - 1 exists as high - order oligomers consist - ing of 14 – 16 monomers . Velocity gradient centrifuga - tion results showed the existence of 350 – 400 kDa complexes of caveolin - 1 in vivo [ 73 , 74 ] . Residues 60 – 101 are suggested to be involved in caveolin – caveolin interactions and formation of homo - oligomers , and thus this region has been designated as the caveolin oligomerization domain [ 74 , 75 ] . Caveolin - 1 oligomerization is thought to facilitate the invagination and release of caveolae into the cyto - plasm [ 76 ] . Therefore , Src - mediated phosphory - lation may regulate the state of caveolin - 1 oligomer - ization and subsequently control vesicle formation and fission from the plasma membrane . Another group has shown that caveolin - 1 shifts to lighter frac - tions on a sucrose gradient upon EGF - stimulation in epithelial cells [ 72 ] . However , several studies showed that the ability of caveolin - 1 to form oligomers incor - porate into the lipid rafts , and bind caveolin - 2 was not changed by either treatment with vanadate or v - Src co - transfection [ 54 , 65 , 77 ] . Since caveolin - 1 (cid:2) and (cid:3) isoforms co - oligomerize and it is possible that not all caveolin - 1 (cid:2) in each oligomeric structure is phospho - rylated , it is not yet clear whether caveolin - 1 phospho - rylation regulates oligomerization state or oligomer stability and thus requires further investigation . Fernandez et al . [ 78 ] assessed the structure of caveolin - 1 and its oligomers by studying the biophys - ical properties of a purified caveolin - 1 fragment . This study showed that the short N - terminal sequence adjacent to the caveolin - 1 membrane spanning domain forms an (cid:2) - helix which is required for J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 11 , No 6 , 2007 1245 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd oligomerization of caveolin [ 78 ] . It was also proposed that the rest of the N - terminus wraps around this (cid:2) - helix , facilitating oligomer formation and stability . In this regard , it is possible that phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 changes its tertiary structure and causes destabilization of high molecular weight oligomers [ 46 ] . Nevertheless , analysis of caveolin - 1 - GFP dynamics suggests that the caveolin - 1 coating on vesicles do not disassemble and do not exchange with other vesicles during the shuttling of caveolae between the plasma membrane and recycling com - partments [ 79 , 80 ] . Perhaps phosphorylation - mediat - ed destabilization of caveolin - 1 oligomers does not result in the complete disassembly of high molecular weight complexes , but rather serves to accommo - date an increase in membrane curvature upon for - mation , fission or closure of caveolae . Changes in the three - dimensional structure of caveolin oligomers may also affect caveolin - 1 binding partners . To date , only two molecules are known to interact with caveolin - 1 in a phosphorylation - depend - ent manner : Csk [ 81 ] and adaptor protein Grb7 [ 77 ] . Csk is a known regulator of Src family kinases and its recruitment to phosphorylated caveolin - 1 provides a negative feedback loop for turning off Src [ 82 ] . Grb7 participates in focal adhesion formation and is impor - tant for cell migration [ 77 ] . Several studies localized caveolin - 1 phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 to focal adhesions [ 77 , 83 , 84 ] . del Pozo et al . suggested that phospho - caveolin - 1 is sequestered in focal adhe - sions and it is redistributed to caveolae upon cell detachment , inducing internalization of lipid raft marker GM1 [ 84 ] . As discussed above , in adherent cells , caveolae do not exchange caveolin molecules [ 79 ] and activation of endocytosis leads to phospho - ryla - tion of caveolin - 1 in the caveolae coat structure . Thus , phospho - caveolin - 1 located in focal adhesions and caveolin - 1 phosphorylated in the course of endocytosis are likely to represent two different pools of phospho - caveolin - 1 in adherent cells . Role of actin cytoskeleton in caveolae - mediated endocytosis The actin cytoskeleton is an essential requirement for endocytosis in several systems [ 85 , 86 ] . Analysis of endothelial cells by electron microscopy revealed caveolae association with fine actin filaments [ 87 ] . This discovery encouraged several research groups to study the role of the actin cytoskeleton in caveolae internalization . Early studies showed that treatment of cells with Cytochalasin D , a drug that disassem - bles filamentous actin , blocked caveolae - mediated internalization of cholera toxin following treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid [ 34 ] . Mundy and co - workers illustrated that in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , cortical actin restricts and organizes caveolae at the plasma membrane since actin depolymerizing drug Latrunculin A induced an increase in lateral mobility of caveolin - 1 - GFP within the plasma membrane [ 88 ] . Other studies showed that the F - actin stabilizing drug Jasplakinolide also blocked caveolae internalization in CV - 1 cells [ 37 ] , implying that dynamic actin cytoskeletal re - modelling is crucial for caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Pelkmans and co - workers proposed a model in which SV40 entrapment in caveolae induces a tyro - sine kinase phosphorylation cascade , local disas - sembly of cortical actin , formation of actin tails on the loaded caveolae and finally vesicle fission and move - ment into the cytoplasm [ 37 , 89 ] . SV40 translocation to caveolae was found to be independent of actin or phosphorylation events , whereas virus internaliza - tion within caveolae required phosphorylation - medi - ated actin re - modelling . Furthermore , other kinases that are involved in actin cytoskeletal regulation , such as phosphotidyl inositol ( 4 , 5 ) kinase , and those that activate the Rho - family small GTPase Cdc42 , were shown to inhibit endocytosis by activation of actin polymerization [ 48 ] . These and other studies lead to the speculation that caveolae are in fact not involved in constitutive endocytosis , but instead represent a high - ly stable plasma membrane compartment anchored by the actin cytoskeleton [ 90 ] which are mobilized in a phosphorylation dependent manner . At this point , it is unclear how the actin cytoskele - ton connects or communicates with caveolae . Dynamin - 2 is known to interact with caveolin - 1 [ 41 , 63 ] as well as actin - binding proteins intersectin and cortactin [ 91 , 92 ] . Intersectin , a protein with multiple Eps15 homology ( EH ) and Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains , interacts with dynamin at the neck of cave - olae in endothelial cells where it is thought to regu - late fission and internalization [ 91 ] . Another possibil - ity is that actin filaments interact with caveolae through filamin A , an actin cross - linking protein that was shown to directly bind caveolin - 1 in vitro [ 93 ] . Additionally , Csk that is recruited to phosphorylated caveolin - 1 has the ability to regulate actin cytoskeletal 1246 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd dynamics [ 77 , 94 , 95 ] . Src also participates in actin cytoskeletal re - modelling by regulating cortactin [ 96 – 98 ] . Therefore , it is possible that Src controls interactions of actin with caveolin - 1 , thereby regulat - ing caveolar detachment from the membrane and vesicle internalization [ 88 , 98 , 99 ] . Although it is now generally accepted that the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in caveolae endocytosis , the mech - anism of actin re - organization upon activation of caveolae endocytosis and it role in vesicle internal - ization remains largely unknown . Conclusion A large number of kinases are thought to be involved in the regulation of caveolae - mediated endocytosis , including those implicated in integrin and Ca 2 + sig - nalling as well as actin cytoskeletal regulation [ 48 ] . Among them are Src kinases , which are activated early during initiation of caveolae - mediated endocy - tosis . Activation of Src represents a general require - ment for caveolae internalization as it was shown to regulate caveolae internalization in cells of different origin , such as fibroblasts , endothelial and epithelial cells . Src is known to phosphorylate caveolae - asso - ciated proteins caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 and dynamin - 2 , regulating the assembly of multi - protein complex - es involved in fission and internalization of caveolae . Src - mediated phoshorylation may also regulate the phosphorylation - dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton that are necessary for caveolae release and migration through the cortical actin network . Ongoing studies by our group and others will hope - fully provide greater insight into the mechanisms which regulate caveolae - mediated endocytosis , fur - ther defining the physiological importance of caveo - lae trafficking in health and disease .
