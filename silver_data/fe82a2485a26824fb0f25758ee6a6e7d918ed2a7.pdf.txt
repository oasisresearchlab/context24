These diderm bacteria possess an unusual polygonal cell shape with sharp ridges that run along the cell body . Previously , a putative surface protein layer ( S - layer ) was observed as the outermost cell layer of these bacteria . We hypothesized that this S - layer is the determining factor for their polygonal cell shape . Therefore , we enriched the S - layer from M . lanthanidiphila cells and through LC - MS / MS identiﬁed a 31 kDa candidate S - layer protein , mela _ 00855 , which had no homology to any other known protein . Antibodies were generated against a synthesized peptide derived from the mela _ 00855 protein sequence and used in immunogold localization to verify its identity and location . Both on thin sections of M . lanthanidiphila cells and in negative - stained enriched S - layer patches , the immunogold localization identiﬁed mela _ 00855 as the S - layer protein . Using electron cryo - tomography and sub - tomogram averaging of S - layer patches , we observed that the S - layer has a hexagonal symmetry . Cryo - tomography of whole cells showed that the S - layer and the outer membrane , but not the peptidoglycan layer and the cytoplasmic membrane , exhibited the polygonal shape . Moreover , the S - layer consisted of multiple rigid sheets that partially overlapped , most likely giving rise to the unique polygonal cell shape . These characteristics make the S - layer of M . lanthanidiphila a distinctive and intriguing case to study .

For a long time , this process was thought to be impossible due to the high activation energy needed to break the C - H bond of methane . However , in 2006 microbe - mediated nitrite - dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane ( AOM ) was discovered ( Raghoebarsing et al . , 2006 ) . Nitrite - dependent AOM was Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 1 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 2 Gambelli et al . Methylomirabilis S - Layer and Cell Shape attributed to “ Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera , ” a bacterium belonging to the NC10 phylum ( Raghoebarsing et al . , 2006 ) . Since their discovery , NC10 bacteria have been found in a variety of natural [ freshwater ( Raghoebarsing et al . , 2006 ; Deutzmann and Schink , 2011 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ; Yan et al . , 2015 ; Graf et al . , 2018 ) , marine ( He et al . , 2015 ; Padilla et al . , 2016 ) , brackish ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) ] and man - made ( wastewater treatment plants ; Luesken et al . , 2011 ; Ho et al . , 2013 ) ecosystems , indicating that these bacteria might contribute signiﬁcantly to the global carbon and nitrogen cycles . Methylomirabilis bacteria are cultivated as ﬂocculent enrichment cultures in bioreactor systems . Even though these bacteria grow anaerobically , the postulated pathway for nitrite - dependent methane oxidation still relies on oxygen . Based on genomic analysis and isotope labeling experiments , it was proposed that nitrite is converted to nitric oxide which is then dismutated by a putative NO dismutase ( NOD ) enzyme ( Ettwig et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) to nitrogen and oxygen . The oxygen would then be used for methane activation by the particulate methane monooxygenase ( pMMO ) enzyme . In the end , methane is oxidized to carbon dioxide as end product ( Ettwig et al . , 2010 ) . An ultrastructural study of the ﬁrst enriched and described Methylomirabilis species , M . oxyfera ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) , showed that these microorganisms are also unique with respect to their cell morphology . M . oxyfera are ca . 300 nm wide and 1 . 5 µ m long diderm bacteria with a polygonal cell shape . The outermost layer of the cell envelope contains multiple longitudinal ridges that end in a cap - like structure at the cell poles . This outermost layer of M . oxyfera was proposed to be a surface protein layer ( S - layer ) , about 8 nm thick , of oblique or square symmetry ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Since S - layers , have been described to promote and maintain the cell shape of bacteria , it was postulated that the S - layer of M . oxyfera is the responsible factor for its polygonal shape ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Besides the canonical shapes of cocci , bacilli , ﬁlaments and spirals , several unusual cell shapes have been described for bacteria and archaea . Some examples are the ﬂat and square cells of the archaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi ( Walsby , 1980 ) , the star - shaped bacteria of the genus Stella ( Vasilyeva , 1985 ) and the square or triangular archaeal cells of Haloarcula species ( Nishiyama et al . , 1992 ; Oren et al . , 1999 ) . It is often diﬃcult to assess what the evolutionary advantage behind these unusual morphologies is . The most popular hypothesis is that microorganisms need to increase their surface area to volume ratio ( SA : V ) to balance nutrient uptake through diﬀusion and disposal of by - products . Any shape more complex than a sphere increases the SA : V compared to a sphere of the same volume ( Purcell , 1977 ; Koch , 1996 ) . However , maintaining a rod or ﬁlamentous shape ( or any shape other than a sphere ) requires the cell to counterbalance the surface tension and the cell osmotic pressure , which would force the cell into a sphere ( Young , 2004 ) . For this reason , the evolution of a robust cell envelope and a cytoskeleton are paramount ( van Teeseling et al . , 2017 ) . S - layers are an almost universal feature in the cell envelope of Archaea and widespread in Bacteria ( Baumeister et al . , 1988 ; Sleytr et al . , 1999 ; Klingl , 2014 ) . In most cases , S - layers consist of a single ( glyco ) protein that self - assembles into a 2 - dimensional , paracrystalline array covering the entire cell surface . S - layer lattices exist in oblique ( p1 , p2 ) , square ( p4 ) , and hexagonal ( p3 , p6 ) symmetries , with a center - to - center spacing of the S - layer unit cell between 4 and 35 nm . A high percentage of the S - layer lattice ( 30 – 70 % ) is occupied by pores of varying diameters ( Sleytr and Sára , 1997 ; Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) . S - layer proteins have been documented in a wide range of masses , generally between 40 and 200 kDa ( Sleytr and Sára , 1997 ; Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) . These proteins are mostly weakly acidic and contain 40 – 60 % hydrophobic amino acids ( Sleytr and Sára , 1997 ) . The bonds between the S - layer proteins are usually non - covalent and the attachment to the underlying cell envelope layer is a combination of weak bonds , such as hydrophobic , hydrogen and ionic bonds ( Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) . However , in the case of diderm Bacteria and Archaea , the underlying cell envelope layer is the lipid bilayer of the outer membrane and of the cytoplasmic membrane , respectively . In monoderm bacteria , however , the S - layer is anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan or to secondary cell wall polymers ( Sleytr et al . , 2014 ; Engelhardt , 2016 ) . S - layer proteins undergo a number of post - translational modiﬁcations , among which glycosylation is the most frequent form ( Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) . Many S - layer proteins are either N - or O - glycosylated , even though in a few cases both types of glycosylation are found on one protein ( Schäﬀer et al . , 2001 ) . S - layers have been studied since 1953 ( Houwink , 1953 ) and to date several S - layer proteins have been isolated and characterized . It has become apparent that S - layer proteins show a low degree of conservation on the level of the primary sequence ( Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) . S - layers fulﬁll several functions , most of which are still only hypothetical . Restricting the ﬁeld to non - pathogenic microorganisms , S - layers can serve as protective coat , molecular sieve , molecule and ion trap ; mediate cell adhesion and surface recognition and are involved in the determination of the cell shape ( Baumeister et al . , 1988 ; Engelhardt , 2007a , b ; Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) . In this study we characterized the cell shape and S - layer ( composition and structure ) of a recently enriched Methylomirabilis bacteria species , M . lanthanidiphila ( Versantvoort et al . , 2018 ) , which similar to M . oxyfera exhibits a polygonal cell shape . To study the role of the S - layer in the determining the cell shape of M . lanthanidiphila , we used an array of biochemical and cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) methods to enrich , identify , localize , and characterize the S - layer protein and lattice . We ﬁnd that the S - layer has a hexagonal symmetry and is composed of a single repeating protein unit identiﬁed as mela _ 00855 . As other S - layers , the M . lanthanidiphila one consisted of individual S - layer sheets . However , unlike other S - layers observed to date , the S - layer sheets of M . lanthanidiphila protrude from the outer membrane , detaching from the cell body , and giving rise to the ridges that likely determine the polygonal shape of the cell . MATERIALS AND METHODS Enrichment Conditions M . lanthanidiphila ( Versantvoort et al . , 2018 ) was cultivated as a ﬂocculent enrichment culture ( ∼ 70 % M . lanthanidiphila ) in a 10 L continuous sequencing batch reactor ( Applicon Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 3 Gambelli et al . Methylomirabilis S - Layer and Cell Shape Biotechnology BV , Delft , the Netherlands ) , originally inoculated with sediment samples from a ditch in the Ooijpolder ( the Netherlands ) ( Ettwig et al . , 2009 ) . The culture was kept anoxic by a continuous supply of a gas mixture composed of methane and carbon dioxide ( 95 : 5 , v / v ) and the medium was continuously ﬂushed with a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide ( 95 : 5 , v / v ) . The temperature was kept stable at 30 ◦ C and the system was stirred at 100 RPM . The bioreactor volume was kept at 10 L by a level sensor - controlled pump in sequential cycles of feeding ( 22 . 5 h ) and resting ( 30 min to settle , 60 min to pump out excess medium ) . The HRT ( hydraulic retention time ) was 10 days and the composition of the medium was 30 – 40 mM NaNO 2 ( depending on culture performance ) , 0 . 78 mM MgSO 4 , 1 . 96 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 73 mM KH 2 PO 4 and the following trace elements : 5 . 4 µ M FeSO 4 , 0 . 26 µ M ZnSO 4 , 0 . 15 µ M CoCl 2 · 6H 2 O , 2 . 82 µ M CuSO 4 , 0 . 24 µ M NiCl 2 , 0 . 07 µ M H 3 BO 3 , 0 . 3 µ M MnCl 2 , 0 . 05 µ M Na 2 WO 4 , 0 . 12 µ M Na 2 MoO 4 , 0 . 14 µ M SeO 2 , and 0 . 12 µ M CeCl 2 , which was adapted from a previously published study ( Ettwig et al . , 2010 ) . The presence of M . lanthanidiphila was monitored during enrichment by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) using a newly developed probe speciﬁc for M . lanthanidiphila ( MLanth181 , [ TCCCATGAGATCCTCACAGG ] ) , which targets bases 181 – 200 in the 16 s rRNA gene sequence ( NCBI sequence ID CABIKM010000010 . 1 : 2618 – 4176 ) , a region just upstream of the target of the DAMOBACT - 0193 probe , which targets all known Methylomirabilis species . The MLanth181 probe has 6 mismatches with the M . oxyfera sequence ( NCBI sequence ID FP565575 : 1586103 – 1587651 ) as shown using pairwise alignment of the 16 S rRNA gene sequences of M . oxyfera and M . lanthanidiphila . No additional targets of the MLanth181 probe ( Raghoebarsing et al . , 2006 ) could be identiﬁed using the SILVA database ( Quast et al . , 2013 ) . Enrichment of the M . lanthanidiphila S - Layer Patches The enrichment of S - layer patches was performed as described previously ( van Teeseling et al . , 2015 ) . Approximately 60 ml of biomass were harvested from the M . lanthanidiphila enrichment culture and gently pottered on ice to disrupt the bacterial aggregates . Cells were concentrated by centrifugation ( Allegra X - 15R , Beckman Coulter ) at 10 , 000 g for 20 min at 4 ◦ C . The supernatant was discarded , and the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of medium . The sample was boiled in 4 % SDS for 1 h . Subsequently , the sample was allowed to cool down and washed three times by ultracentrifugation ( Beckman - Coulter Optima - XE - 90 ultracentrifuge ) at 138 , 550 g for 10 min at 25 ◦ C . Each time the pellet was thoroughly resuspended in 8 ml of MilliQ . To digest the peptidoglycan sacculi , a lysozyme treatment ( ﬁnal concentration 10 mg / ml ) was performed overnight at 37 ◦ C with vigorous shaking . The lysozyme and peptidoglycan residues were removed from the sample by an additional ultracentrifugation step . To isolate S - layer suitable for cryo - EM the isolation procedure was further optimized . A sample of 3 ml biomass from the M . lanthanidiphila enrichment culture was passed 10 times through a ball - bearing homogenizer ( Isobiotech ) , using a ball with 8 µ m clearance , to obtain a homogeneous sample . This sample was boiled for 1 . 5 h in 4 % SDS to liberate the S - layer . S - layers were pelleted and washed 3 times by ultracentrifugation as described above . The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 µ l MilliQ and dialyzed ( 50 kDA cutoﬀ ) against 300 ml MilliQ containing activated biobeads ( Biorad ) for 2 days at 4 ◦ C to adsorb the remaining SDS . Sample quality was tested by transmission electron microscopy using negative stain ( 2 % uranyl acetate ) on grids containing a continuous carbon ﬁlm ( 200 mesh , copper ) . LC - MS / MS for Identiﬁcation of the M . lanthanidiphila S - Layer Protein and Antibody Generation Three dilutions of the enriched S - layer patches ( undiluted , diluted 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 with MilliQ ) were processed by in - solution digestion to obtain peptides for LC - MS / MS . Each sample had a total volume of 100 µ l . Samples were diluted 1 : 1 with 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 1 µ l 50 mM DTT was added to the sample and incubated for 20 min at RT . Subsequently , 1 µ l of 50 mM iodoacetamide was added and the sample was incubated for an additional 20 min in the dark . LysC enzyme ( 1 µ l , 0 . 5 µ g / µ l stock ) was added to the sample and incubated for 3 h at RT . Samples were then diluted threefold with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate and trypsin ( 1 µ l , 0 . 5 µ g / µ l stock ) was added . Samples were incubated overnight at 37 ◦ C and stored at − 80 ◦ C . Tryptic peptides were desalted and concentrated using C18 solid phase extraction ( Omix tips , Agilent Technologies ) . Peptides were analyzed using nanoﬂow ultra - high pressure C18 reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled online to a quadrupole orthogonal time - of - ﬂight mass spectrometer ( maXis Plus , Bruker Daltonics ) via a vacuum assisted axial desolvation nanoﬂow electrospray ionization source ( Captivesprayer , Bruker Daltonics ) . Peptides were separated using a linear gradient of 5 – 45 % acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % acetic acid for 60 min at a ﬂow rate of 500 nl / min . The mass spectrometer was programmed to acquire 1 MS spectrum at 3 Hz with subsequent data dependent MS / MS spectra at precursor intensity scaled acquisition speeds ( 3 Hz at 10 , 000 intensity up to 16 Hz at 150 , 000 intensity ) . Total MS + MS / MS duty cycle was 3 s . Dynamic exclusion was enabled to prevent re - analysis of the same precursor ions . Acquired data ﬁles were processed in DataAnalysis 4 . 2 ( Bruker Daltonics ) to extract MS / MS data for subsequent database searches . Proteins were identiﬁed using the MASCOT search tool ( Matrix Science , London , United Kingdom ) and an in - house protein sequence database of the predicted M . lanthanidiphila proteome . MASCOT search parameters included tryptic speciﬁcity , maximum of two missed cleavages , Carbamidomethyl ( C ) as ﬁxed modiﬁcation , and Oxidation ( M ) and Deamidation ( NQ ) as variable modiﬁcations . Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance to 0 . 05 Da . A single protein was identiﬁed by the MS / MS database search which was mela _ 00855 ( NCBI sequence ID : VUZ84482 . 1 ) . The full protein sequence was handed over to the company GenScript . A protein fragment ( 33 – 260 aa ) of mela _ 00855 was synthesized and heterologously expressed in E . coli . The protein fragment was then used to Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 4 Gambelli et al . Methylomirabilis S - Layer and Cell Shape raise antibodies in rabbit . The pre - immune serum and the ﬁnal bleed ( crude antiserum ) were used for immunoblotting and immunogold localization . Cell - Free Extract , PAGE and Immunoblotting A sample of 500 ml was harvested from the M . lanthanidiphila bioreactor and centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C in a Sorvall centrifuge ( Sorvall Lynx 4 , 000 ) . The pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mM potassium - phosphate ( KPi ) buﬀer at pH 7 . The cells were centrifuged again at 20 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C . The pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mM KPi with 2 . 5 mM EDTA at pH 7 and six protease inhibitor tablets ( Pierson Protease Inhibitor , Mini tablets , EDTA - free , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Cells were sonicated on ice for 10 min , 5 s on and 5 s oﬀ . To remove debris and unbroken cells , the sonicated sample was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C . The supernatant of lysed cells was used for further PAGE and immunoblotting . The cell - free extract was boiled for 7 min in SDS sample buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl buﬀer pH 6 . 8 containing 5 % β - mercaptoethanol , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol and 0 . 005 % bromophenol blue ) , and 20 µ g protein per lane was loaded onto 4 – 15 % Criterion TGX precast gels ( Bio - Rad ) for PAGE according to manufacturer’s instructions . After PAGE separation , the proteins were transferred from the gel onto a Trans - blot Turbo , Midi format 0 . 2 µ m nitrocellulose transfer membrane ( Bio - Rad ) with the Turbo blotter system ( Bio - Rad ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . The blotting was performed at 2 . 5 A , 25 V for 7 min . Dried blots were stored at 4 ◦ C . Prior to starting the immunoblot protocol , blots were kept at RT for 30 min and then incubated in MilliQ water for an additional 30 min . Blocking was performed for 1 h in 1 % BSA in 10 mM TBS ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . The blots were then incubated for 60 min in α - mela _ 00855 antiserum diluted 125 - , 500 - or 1 , 000 - fold in blocking buﬀer . The negative controls were incubated in the pre - immune serum diluted 125 - fold or incubated in blocking buﬀer without primary antibody . The blots were then washed three times for 10 min in TBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween and incubated for 60 min in monoclonal mouse anti - rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted 150 , 000 - fold in blocking buﬀer . The blots were washed two times for 10 min in TBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween and two times for 10 min in TBS . Finally , blots were incubated with a 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolylphosphate ( BCIP ) / nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) liquid substrate system ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 5 min and rinsed for 10 min in MilliQ water . Immunogold Localization of the S - Layer Protein in M . lanthanidiphila Ultrathin Sections M . lanthanidiphila cells were harvested from the bioreactor and cryo - ﬁxed by high - pressure freezing ( Leica HPM 100 , Leica Microsystems , Vienna , Austria ) . Samples were placed into a 100 - µ m cavity of a type - A platelet ( 3 mm diameter ; 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 - mm depth , Leica Microsystems ) and closed with the ﬂat side of a lecithin - coated type B platelet ( 3 - mm diameter ; 0 . 3 - mm depth ) . The frozen samples were stored in liquid nitrogen . For Lowicryl HM20 embedding , frozen samples were freeze - substituted in 0 . 2 % uranyl acetate in acetone . The substitution started at − 90 ◦ C for 48 h ; brought to − 70 ◦ C at 2 ◦ C per hour and kept at − 70 ◦ C for 12 h ; brought to − 50 ◦ C at 2 ◦ C per h and kept at − 50 ◦ C for 12 h in a freeze - substitution unit ( AFS2 ; Leica Microsystems , Vienna , Austria ) . To remove unbound uranyl acetate , the samples were washed twice with 100 % acetone for 30 min at − 50 ◦ C . Keeping the temperature stable at − 50 ◦ C , the sample was inﬁltrated with a graduated series of Lowicryl HM20 ( 10 , 25 , 50 , and 75 % ) in acetone . Each step was 1 h long . Three ﬁnal inﬁltration phases were performed with 100 % Lowicryl HM20 : ﬁrst for 1 . 5 h , then overnight and ﬁnally 2 h . Polymerization of the resin was obtained by irradiating the sample with UV light for 120 h at − 50 ◦ C after which the temperature was brought to 0 ◦ C in 24 h at 2 . 1 ◦ C per hour . UV light was switched oﬀ and the temperature was increased to 20 ◦ C in 5 h at 4 ◦ C per hour . Ultrathin sections of 55 nm were cut using a Leica UCT ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems , Vienna , Austria ) and collected on carbon - Formvar - coated 100 mesh copper grids ( Agar Scientiﬁc ) . Grids containing ultrathin sections were rinsed for 10 min in 0 . 1 M PHEM ( 1X PHEM contains : 60 mM PIPES , 25 mM HEPES , 10 mM EGTA , and 4 mM MgSO 4 · 7H20 ) buﬀer pH 7 and blocked for 20 min in 1 % BSAc ( Aurion ) in PHEM buﬀer . Grids were incubated for 60 min at RT with the primary antiserum targeting the S - layer protein diluted 1 : 400 in blocking buﬀer . Negative controls were incubated for 60 min in blocking buﬀer without primary antiserum and with the pre - immune serum diluted 1 : 400 . After this incubation , the grids were washed for 10 min in 0 . 1 % BSAc in 0 . 1 M PHEM buﬀer and incubated for 30 min with protein A coupled to 10 nm gold particles ( PAG 10 , CMC UMC Utrecht ) , diluted 1 : 60 in blocking buﬀer . The grids were then washed again ﬁrst in 0 . 1 % BSAc in 0 . 1 M PHEM buﬀer for 5 min and then in 0 . 1 M PHEM buﬀer for 5 min . To ﬁx the labeling , the grids were incubated for 5 min in 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PHEM buﬀer and subsequently washed for 10 min in MilliQ . Post - staining was performed by incubating for 20 min on drops of 2 % uranyl acetate , after which the grids were quickly washed in 4 drops of MilliQ and allowed to air dry . The grids containing labeled ultrathin sections were investigated at 60 kV in a JEOL ( Tokyo , Japan ) JEM - 1010 TEM . Immunogold Localization of the M . lanthanidiphila S - Layer Patches A sample of 3 . 5 µ l of enriched S - layer patches ( obtained as described in the section “Enrichment of the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer patches” ) was spotted on carbon - Formvar - coated 200 mesh copper grids ( Agar Scientiﬁc ) and incubated for 15 min at RT under moisture - controlled conditions . Subsequently the grids were blotted to remove excess sample and were allowed to air dry overnight . Prior to starting the immunogold localization protocol , the grids were heated at 120 ◦ C for 20 min . The grids were rinsed for 6 min on drops of 0 . 1 M PHEM buﬀer pH 7 and blocked with 1 % BSAc ( Aurion ) in 0 . 1 M PHEM buﬀer pH 7 Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 5 Gambelli et al .

The grids containing labeled negative - stained S - layer patches were investigated at 60 kV in a JEOL ( Tokyo , Japan ) JEM - 1010 TEM . Cryo - Tomography Whole Cell Cryo - ET For the whole cell cryo - ET ( Figures 1 , 2 and Supplementary Movies 1 , 2 ) , a sample of 15 ml was collected from the M . lanthanidiphila enrichment culture and centrifuged ( Beckman Coulter ) for 2 min at 5 , 000 g . The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of bioreactor medium . Cells were bead - beaten using glass beads ( 0 . 5 mm , BioSpec ) for 1 min at 50 / s oscillation in a tissuelyser ( Tissuelyser LT , Quiagen ) to break the cell aggregates . To collect the single cells , the sample was pulse - centrifuged in a tabletop microcentrifuge . The supernatant was diluted 1 : 2 with reactor medium until an OD600 of 0 . 45 . Prior to sub - tomogram averaging of S - layers in situ ( Figure 3 ) , the samples were reproduced , under slightly diﬀerent conditions as before . 3 ml biomass from the M . lanthanidiphila bioreactor was passed 3 times through a ball - bearing homogenizer ( Isobiotech ) using a ball with 8 µ m clearance , to break the cell aggregates . For both datasets , ∼ 2 µ l containing M . lanthanidiphila single cells and 0 . 5 µ l 10 nm protein A gold ( CMC , UMC Utrecht , the Netherlands ) were applied on a glow - discharged Quantifoil type R2 / 2 copper 200 - mesh grids . The cells were frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mk4 ( FEI , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) with controlled humidity ( 100 % ) using ablotforce of 1 and a blot time of 3 s . Tilt series were recorded at the Netherlands Center for Electron Nanoscopy ( NeCEN , Leiden , the Netherlands ) on a Titan Krios ( FEI , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) microscope at 300 kV equipped with a Schottky type ﬁeld emission gun and a K3 camera ( Gatan ) operated in counting mode . Tilt series were acquired using UCSF Tomo ( Zheng et al . , 2007 ) . Initially , a linear tilt scheme from − 60 ◦ to + 60 ◦ with a 2 ◦ increment at − 6 µ m defocus and a magniﬁcation of 26 , 000 × ( pixel size of 4 . 6 Å ) was employed . To improve data quality for sub - tomogram averaging , data were collected at 33 , 000 × magniﬁcation ( pixel size of 2 . 64 Å ) and dose - symmetric tilt scheme ( Hagen et al . , 2017 ) from − 60 to + 60 with a 2 ◦ increment at − 4 µ m defocus was employed using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) . The total dose on the record area did not exceed 100 e - / Å2 and varied between 93 and 96 . 5 e − / Å 2 . Tomograms were reconstructed and CTF corrected in IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) and binned threefold ( ﬁnal pixel size of 9 . 267 Å for whole cell cryo - ET ; pixel size of 7 . 92 Å , for sub - tomogram averaging ) . Tomograms were either reconstructed using SIRT ( simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique ) to optimize contrast or weighted back projection for sub - tomogram averaging . The whole cell movies ( Supplementary Movies 1 , 2 ) were made in IMOD . Cryo - ET of Isolated S - Layers and Sub - Tomogram Averaging For cryo - ET of isolated S - layers and sub - tomogram averaging ( Figure 4 ) , isolated S - layers were obtained as described above ( section “Enrichment of the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer patches” ) . Before plunge freezing , potential aggregates in the sample were pelleted and 2 µ l of the supernatant was mixed with 0 . 5 µ l 10 nm ProteinA gold solution ( CMC , UMC Utrecht ) on glow discharged Quantifoil type R2 / 2 copper 200 - mesh grids .

The tilt series were acquired in low - dose using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) , employing a dose - symmetric tilt - scheme ( Hagen et al . , 2017 ) from − 60 ◦ to + 60 ◦ with a 2 ◦ increment at − 4 µ m defocus . The total dose on the record area did not exceed 100 e - / Å2 . Recorded tilt series were reconstructed using IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) , and tomograms were generated using the weighted back - projection algorithm . Sub - Tomogram Averaging To obtain the structure of the S - layer in situ and in its isolated form , sub - volumes were initially selected by applying a random grid of points over the S - layer patches in 3Dmod ( IMOD software package ) . Using PEET ( Nicastro et al . , 2006 ; Heumann et al . , 2011 ) , sub - volumes were extracted , aligned , and averaged . A total of 8 , 938 sub - volumes of 120 × 120 × 60 pixels in dimension were used for averaging the isolated S - layer patches and 1 , 330 sub - volumes for obtaining the average from the S - layer in situ . P6 symmetry was applied to the ﬁnal average obtained from unbinned and unﬁltered tomograms . The ﬁnal S - layer average was visualized and segmented using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . A resolution of 21 Å nm of the average was estimated based on the reﬂections in its power spectrum calculated by IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . Supplementary Movie 3 was made using UCSF Chimera . S - Layer Sequence Coverage and Protein Glycosylation Analysis In - Solution Digestion of Isolated S - Layer Protein Enrichment A volume of 50 µ l of S - layer enrichment sample ( approx . 0 . 1 mg / ml protein content ) was diluted 1 : 1 with 8 M Urea in 10 mM Tris - HCl buﬀer pH 8 . 0 . To this solution , 1 µ l of freshly prepared 50 mM DTT solution was added and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 1 h . Next , 1 µ l of a freshly prepared 50 mM IAA ( iodoacetamide ) solution was added and incubated in the dark for 30 min . The solution was diluted to below 1 M Urea using 200 mM bicarbonate buﬀer and one aliquot protein each were digested using sequencing grade Trypsin or Chymotrypsin , respectively ( Promega ) at 37 ◦ C overnight ( protease / protein of approx . 1 : 50 ) . Finally , the protein digests were desalted using an Oasis HLB 96 well plate ( Waters ) according to the manufacturer protocols . The puriﬁed peptide fraction was speed - vac dried and stored at − 20 ◦ C until further processed .

Thereby , 1 µ l of the protein digest was analyzed using a linear gradient from 5 to 30 % B over 40 min , and further to 60 % B over 15 min , maintaining a ﬂow rate of 350 nL / min .

The S - layer was clearly discernable as a distinct layer ∼ 11 nm above the outer membrane . Instead of adhering to the cell body as usually seen in other microorganisms ( van Teeseling et al . , 2014 ; Bharat et al . , 2017 ; Gambelli et al . , 2019 ; Gaisin et al . , 2020 ; von Kügelgen et al . , 2020 ; Oatley et al . , 2020 . For examples of reviews see Albers and Meyer ( 2011 ) ; Pavkov - Keller et al . ( 2011 ) , Rodrigues - Oliveira et al . ( 2017 ) , and Pum et al . ( 2021 ) , the S - layer of M . lanthanidiphila formed several distinct patches . These patches had the appearance of planar sheets and intersected at sharp ridges , thereby likely deﬁning the polygonal shape of the cell . The distance between the S - layer and the outer membrane remained constant , indicating that the S - layer proteins are anchored to the outer membrane , but not to the cytoplasmic membrane that did not have a polygonal shape . The peptidoglycan layer also did not have a polygonal shape . In intact cells ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1 ) the peptidoglycan appeared to slightly protrude toward the edges of the polygon , without however strictly assuming a polygonal shape . Furthermore , in isolated peptidoglycan sacculi ( Figure 5A ) the peptidoglycan was round . An additional electron dense layer was present between the outer membrane and the S - layer in all observed M . lanthanidiphila cells ( Figure 1B , inset ) . At the ridges , the S - layer sheets protrude , overlapping with each other , and partially detaching from the outer membrane ( Figure 1A , arrow ) . The inset in Figure 1A shows a snapshot of the cell envelope elements : cytoplasmic membrane , peptidoglycan layer , outer membrane , and S - layer . The segmentation of the M . lanthanidiphila cell in Figure 1B showed that the S - layer was arranged around the cell in multiple sheets of diﬀerent sizes that partially overlapped with each other ( Figure 2 ) . Identiﬁcation of the M . lanthanidiphila S - Layer Protein Several established protocols were extensively tested and optimized to enrich or isolate the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer protein . Speciﬁcally , we changed the pH of the solution ( low pH , acid treatment ) , added detergent ( Triton X - 100 ) , denaturing agents ( urea , guanidine hydrochloride , lithium chloride ) , or chelating agents ( EDTA ) . In almost all cases , the S - layer was released from the cell , but could not be disassembled and did not show any protein bands on SDS - PAGE . Therefore , M . lanthanidiphila cells were boiled in 4 % SDS and subsequently ultracentrifuged to enrich S - layer patches . The patches were digested in - solution and analyzed for protein content by LC - MS / MS . Only one protein was retrieved that matched to the predicted proteome of M . lanthanidiphila . This protein was mela _ 00855 ( gene length 950 bp , protein length 316 aa , MW Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 8 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 9 Gambelli et al .

The protein mela _ 00855 was annotated as hypothetical protein based on Blastp analysis . The only protein that matched mela _ 0855 in Blastp analysis was an M . oxyfera protein annotated as “exported protein of unknown function” ( NCBI sequence ID : CBE67388 ) . The two proteins shared 40 . 88 % protein sequence identity and 97 % coverage ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . The amino acid sequence of mela _ 00855 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) was analyzed for the presence of conserved regions consulting InterProScan ( Jones et al . , 2014 ) . The protein sequence had two transmembrane regions , one being a predicted N - terminal signal peptide ( 1 – 34 aa ) , and the other a predicted C - terminal IPTL - CTERM protein sorting domain ( 285 – 312 aa ) . To conﬁrm the identity of the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer protein , antibodies were raised against a synthesized protein fragment ( from 33 to 260 aa of mela _ 00855 ) . The aﬃnity and speciﬁcity of the crude antiserum was tested and conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis using M . lanthanidiphila cell extracts ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . The S - layer sheets were isolated from M . lanthanidiphila cells ( Figure 5A ) and the mela _ 00855 antiserum was used to localize the S - layer on negative - stained enriched S - layer patches and thin - sections of resin - embedded M . lanthanidiphila cells . The immunogold localization on negative - stained enriched S - layer patches showed abundant and speciﬁc binding of the antiserum to the patches ( Figure 5B ) . The immunogold localization on thin sections resulted in the speciﬁc labeling of the M . lanthanidiphila cell envelope and it was particularly abundant in the area occupied by the outer membrane and the S - layer ( Figures 5C , D ) . Labeling was also present on edges protruding from the bacterial cell wall and on shed S - layer sheets ( Figure 5D ) . Structure of the M . lanthanidiphila S - Layer The structure of the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer was investigated by cryo - ET and sub - tomogram averaging of enriched S - layer patches ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Figure 4 , and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . The ﬁnal map was achieved by averaging 8 , 938 sub - volumes ( Figure 4A ) and had a resolution of 21 Å based on the Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) power spectrum ( see Supplementary Figure 5 for both FFT and FSC ) . Further , analysis of the FFT power spectrum of the averaged S - layer volumes showed that the S - layer had a hexagonal , p6 symmetry , and the unit cell dimensions were ∼ 11 . 6 × ∼ 11 . 9 nm including an angle of 60 ◦ ( Figure 4B1 ) . A single S - layer building block is shown in Figure 4C . This density showed a fork - like appearance , with three extracellular protrusions that join into a single stalk at the inward - facing side of the lattice . When observed in cross sections ( Figure 4D ) the S - layer building block appeared to have two - fold symmetry with respect to its long axis , which may suggest that the subunit is a dimer . Three S - layer putative dimers constitute the repeating unit cell of the S - layer ( Figure 4B2 ) . The S - layer lattice contained two main pore Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 9 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 10 Gambelli et al . Methylomirabilis S - Layer and Cell Shape types : a ∼ 12 nm 2 hexagonal pore surrounded by six units , and a ∼ 3 . 9 nm 2 triangular pore surrounded by three units ( Figure 4D1 ) . On the inward - facing side of the S - layer , the three protein densities surrounding a triangular pore converged and connected at the center of it . As each of the triangular pores has six triangular neighbors and each dimer - like unit is shared between two neighboring triangular pores , the entire S - layer is interconnected . The S - layer patches were roughly perpendicular to the electron beam during data acquisition and , therefore , the map was stretched in Z due to the missing wedge . From the cryo - tomograms of whole M . lanthanidiphila cells it could be determined that the S - layer has a thickness of ∼ 7 nm . For visualization purposes a median ﬁlter ( 6 iterations ) was applied to the obtained average and the Z - scaling adjusted to match the thickness obtained from the cryo - tomograms . Multiple copies of the average were aligned to simulate the structure of the S - layer sheet ( Figure 3D ) . To determine the orientation of the obtained S - layer model with respect to the cell envelope , cryo - ET and subsequent sub - tomogram averaging was performed on whole M . lanthanidiphila cells . The in situ average of the S - layer conﬁrmed that the fork - like protrusions of the S - layer units face the extracellular environment , while the densities that connect the units with each other face the outer membrane ( Figures 3A – C ) . S - layer proteins are usually highly glycosylated . To investigate , if this is also the case for mela _ 00855 , we analyzed its primary sequence for N - or O - linked glycosylation sequons using GlycoPP v1 . 0 ( Chauhan et al . , 2012 ) . The server predicted 46 putative O - linked and 4 putative N - linked glycosylated sites ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . To conﬁrm this prediction , we performed an in - depth characterization of the puriﬁed S - layer by high - resolution shotgun proteomics ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Apart from the C - terminal tail , the complete amino acid sequence could be covered with peptide fragments . However , interestingly no indications for N or O - linked glycans could be found . DISCUSSION We analyzed the cell shape and S - layer structure of M . lanthanidiphila to understand the origin of its polygonal cell shape . To this end , we enriched , identiﬁed , localized , and characterized the S - layer protein and lattice . The building block of the S - layer was identiﬁed as the protein mela _ 00855 . This protein assembled in planar sheets of hexagonal ( p6 ) symmetry . The S - layer sheets partially overlapped and entirely covered the outer membrane . The polygonal shape was clearly observed in both the S - layer and the outer membrane , but not in the peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membrane , leading us to conclude that the S - layer is very likely responsible for the polygonal shape of this bacterium . This S - layer is highly stable and resilient . In fact , we were unable to break the S - layer patches down to its monomers . Extensive attempts using diﬀerent protocols were made to disrupt the S - layer protein - protein interactions , but always resulted in the enrichment of S - layer patches and not of single subunits visible on SDS - PAGE . Also in other instances , S - layers have been shown to be impervious to disassembly , for example archaea of the Thermoproteus ( Messner et al . , 1986 ) , Pyrobaculum ( Phipps et al . , 1990 , 1991 ) and Staphylothermus ( Peters et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) genera . However , this resilience is unusual for bacterial S - layers and indicates that this lattice is highly stable , suggesting that the protein - protein interaction occurring between these S - layer proteins can be very strong and possibly of kinds not usually found in interprotein interactions in S - layer lattices , such as covalent bonds . The S - layer is constituted by several mostly straight patches , distributed with diﬀerent orientations in order to cover the cell entirely . Moreover , the sheets protrude from the outer membrane toward the extracellular environment still maintaining their orientation . From these observations we concluded that these S - layer sheets are very rigid . A dense network of protein bridges links the S - layer morphological units . These proteinaceous connections are present over every triangular pore throughout the S - layer lattice . We hypothesize that the dense net of protein bridges , together with perhaps stronger protein - protein interactions , establishes the observed rigidity of the S - layer . S - layers are typically highly interconnected structures , and protein connections between the morphological units have been observed in other lattices ( Phipps et al . , 1990 ; Pum et al . , 1991 ; Lupas et al . , 1994 ; Arbing et al . , 2012 ; Bharat et al . , 2017 ; Gambelli et al . , 2019 ) . Future experiments to probe the rigidity and elasticity of this S - layer could include Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) to analyze the binding forces between S - layer proteins both on the cell and on enriched S - layer patches ( Toca - Herrera et al . , 2004 ; Martín - Molina et al . , 2006 ; Scheuring and Dufrene , 2010 ; Viljoen et al . , 2020 ) . As opposed to the cytoplasmic membrane and peptidoglycan , the outer membrane followed the polygonal cell shape and cryo - ET revealed an additional layer between the S - layer and outer membrane . A similarly weak electron density between the S - layer and the outer membrane has been observed in C . crescentus , another Gram - negative bacterium ( Bharat et al . , 2017 ) . In this bacterium , the S - layer protein RsaA is attached to the outer membrane via the N - terminus region of the S - layer protein that interacts with the LPS ( Ford et al . , 2007 ; von Kügelgen et al . , 2020 ) . We thus hypothesize that a similar mechanism could mediate the attachment of the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer protein to the outer membrane , via the N - terminus region of mela _ 00855 . Based on the observations that the outer membrane and the S - layer are the only polygonal components in the cell wall of M . lanthanidiphila , we concluded that the S - layer is likely to be responsible for the unusual cell shape of these bacteria . However , additional elements could contribute to the cell shape determination . Particularly , protein ﬁlament systems have been shown to be widespread in prokaryotic cells and play a major role in cell shape determination ( Wagstaﬀ and Löwe , 2018 ) . Protein ﬁlaments such as crescentin and bactoﬁlins are localized in the cytoplasm and are membrane - bound ( Ausmees et al . , 2003 ; Deng et al . , 2020 ) . Because the inner membrane of M . lanthanidiphila does not follow the sharp angles of the outer membrane and S - layer , we exclude that cytoplasmic elements have a structural role in the cell shape maintenance of these bacteria . However , other cytoskeletal elements of still Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 10 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 766527 fmicb - 12 - 766527 November 25 , 2021 Time : 13 : 39 # 11 Gambelli et al . Methylomirabilis S - Layer and Cell Shape unknown nature could function as a scaﬀold for the S - layer . S - layer proteins in diﬀerent microorganisms share little to no similarity ( Engelhardt and Peters , 1998 ; Bharat et al . , 2021 ) , sometimes even in the case of closely related microorganisms ( Avall - Jääskeläinen and Palva , 2005 ; Fagan and Fairweather , 2014 ) . The M . lanthanidiphila mela _ 00855 had no homologs ( after BLASTp ) besides a 40 . 88 % protein sequence identity with a protein from M . oxyfera ( NCBI sequence ID : CBE67388 ) . The power spectrum of the surface of freeze - etched M . oxyfera cells showed its S - layer to have either an oblique ( p2 ) or square ( p4 ) symmetry , and a center - to - center spacing of the S - layer morphological unit of ∼ 7 nm ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . These symmetries are diﬀerent from what we observed for M . lanthanidiphila . Nevertheless , both M . lanthanidiphila and M . oyfera , have a similar polygonal cell shape and the S - layer occurs as straight patches that partially overlap and protrude from the edges of the cell . It would be very interesting to investigate and compare the S - layers of these two Methylomirabilis species in the future . The mela _ 00855 protein sequence showed 46 putative O - linked and 4 putative N - linked glycosylated sites . Moreover , the genome organization around mela _ 00855 shows genes involved in glycosylation ( glycosyl transferase , mela _ 00856 , mela _ 00851 ; UDP - N - acetyl - D - glucosamine dehydrogenase , mela _ 00857 ) . Therefore , an in - depth characterization of the enriched S - layer by high - resolution shotgun proteomics was performed aiming for high amino acid sequence coverage . Except for the C - terminal tail , the complete amino acid sequence could be covered with peptide fragments . Thereby , no indications for N - or O - linked glycans were found . Nevertheless , because peptides from the C - terminal tail could not be detected , we cannot exclude the presence of glycosylation in this area ( even though preliminary gels and staining attempts seem to exclude this scenario , data not shown ) . Nevertheless , the C - terminal part includes a very hydrophilic sequence region , and therefore is diﬃcult to capture by the applied analysis approach . Glycosylation is a frequent post - translational modiﬁcation in S - layer proteins ( Ristl et al . , 2010 ; Sleytr et al . , 2014 ) , albeit there have been reports of S - layer proteins with limited sugar content ( Peters et al . , 1987 ) as well as its absence ( Masuda and Kawata , 1983 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) . Glycans have been hypothesized to favor protein stability ( Mengele and Sumper , 1992 ; Engelhardt and Peters , 1998 ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . Interestingly , however , despite the apparent lack of glycosylation , the S - layer of M . lanthanidiphila shows remarkable resilience to disassembly . In the case of H . volcanii it was shown that environmental conditions ( particularly salinity ) modulate the glycan structure of the S - layer protein as well as the glycosylation sites ( Guan et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , it could be speculated that under diﬀerent growth conditions glycosylation might be present on the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer . We identiﬁed mela _ 00855 as the only component of the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer . Nonetheless , we cannot exclude the possibility that other proteins may be associated to the lattice . Infact , due to the impervious nature of disassembly , the S - layer patches were boiled in SDS prior to LC - MS / MS , likely causing the loss of less resilient protein components ( such as membrane - associated proteins ) . Additionally , no other S - layers have been characterized from members of the NC10 phylum , thereby limiting our understanding of this system . Multi - component S - layers have been described for bacteria and archaea , in which the lattice is constituted by more than one structural and functional component ( Mayr et al . , 1996 ; Veith et al . , 2009 ; Bradshaw et al . , 2017 ; Gambelli et al . , 2019 ) . Food for thought is how the rigid S - layer sheets are assembled on the outside of the M . lanthanidiphila cell . Assembly could be comparable to other S - layers that entirely adhere to the cell body . In the case of C . crescentus , S - layer proteins are secreted and diﬀuse on the lipopolysaccharide until they are incorporated at the edges of growing 2D crystals , preferentially at the cell poles and at the division site ( Comerci et al . , 2019 ) . C . diﬃcile and H . volcanii also assemble new S - layer proteins at the mid - cell during cell growth ( Abdul - Halim et al . , 2020 ; Oatley et al . , 2020 ) . Given that the M . lanthanidiphila S - layer sheets partially overlap each other , they could be assembled continuously , leading to individual sheets being pushed further out – perhaps until they snap oﬀ . Performing time - lapse microscopy of a growing and dividing M . lanthanidiphila cell might answer this question but it is currently technically impossible considering that these bacteria grow as aggregates in an enrichment culture , are anaerobic , have a slow generation time and are not genetically tractable . Another open question regards the evolutionary advantage of the polygonal shape of M . lanthanidiphila ( and the Methylomirabilis genus in general ) . We calculated that a Methylomirabilis cell with a polygonal shape has a SA : V ratio 0 . 2 µ m - 1 higher than a common rod of the same size ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Therefore , the selective advantage of this shape for nutrient access seems limited . In laboratory enrichment cultures Methylomirabilis bacteria prefer to grow in aggregates with other microorganisms rather than planktonically ( Gambelli et al . , 2018 ) . S - layers have been implicated to promote formation and maintenance of the aggregates ( Zu et al . , 2020 ) , the ﬂat surfaces of the cell walls of Methylomirabilis bacteria might aid in the attachment of one cell to the other . Moreover , ﬂat surfaces and aggregates could help against shearing forces that these microorganisms might be exposed to in their natural habitats ( Mader et al . , 1999 ) . Alternatively , predation may also be a selective factor ( Beveridge et al . , 1997 ) . Indeed , the cell wall is the ﬁrst element with which predators come into contact . A rigid and resilient cell wall might be harder to digest for predators , making Methylomirabilis bacteria a less desirable target . Finally , the possibility that the polygonal shape is not a selective trait that directly confers a survival advantage , but rather a secondary or superﬂuous trait , as a by - product of other selective features , cannot be excluded . Studies with knock - out mutants could unravel the molecular mechanisms and function of the polygonal cell shape . However , these techniques are currently unfeasible in the case of Methylomirabilis bacteria because no pure culture and genetic system are available to date . These characteristics make Methylomirabilis bacteria hard to manipulate and a challenging case study for cell shape investigation . Without a genetic system , a possible alternative could be to heterologously express the S - layer protein and observe if the host cell would acquire a polygonal shape .

Methylomirabilis S - Layer and Cell Shape S - layers have been a subject of investigation through electron microscopy for nearly seven decades ( see Sleytr et al . , 2014 for an overview ) . However , the recent developments in cryo - EM have sparked a renewed interest in these fascinating structures due to advancements in cryo - EM allowing us to reach ( near ) atomic resolution ( Bharat et al . , 2017 ; Fioravanti et al . , 2019 ; Gambelli et al . , 2019 ; Herrmann et al . , 2020 ; von Kügelgen et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , we expect additional studies that will broaden our understanding of the role of S - layers in the microbial lifestyle , and how we can exploit them as nanotechnologies .
