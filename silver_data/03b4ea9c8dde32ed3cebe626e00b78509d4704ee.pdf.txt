Nickerson Stevens Institute of Technology jnickerson @ stevens . edu Yasuaki Sakamoto Stevens Institute of Technology yasuaki . sakamoto @ stevens . edu ABSTRACT The effect of exposure to an original or common idea on crowdsourced idea generation was studied by asking crowd workers to design a public service advertisement . As compared to having no idea exposure , exposure to an original idea decreased fluency and increased the average originality of ideas generated by each person . By contrast , exposure to a common idea had no effect on either idea originality or fluency . However , the two exposure conditions showed no significant difference in either fluency or idea originality . The semantic similarity between a stimulus idea and the first idea generated was higher when the stimulus was common , as opposed to original , as measured by latent semantic analysis . The implications of these results for research and practice are discussed . Keywords Crowdsourcing , idea exposure , idea generation , creativity , semantic similarity . INTRODUCTION Due to the widespread availability of integrative information and communication technology , crowdsourcing – the assembly of a crowd to perform a task ( Howe , 2006 ) – has become easy to accomplish . Online crowdsourcing platforms , such as Amazon Mechanical Turk ( www . mturk . com ) , can be used for generating creative ideas ( Kittur , 2010 ; Nickerson and Sakamoto , 2010 ; Sakamoto and Bao , 2011 ) . In crowdsourcing approaches to creative work , one technique that has been shown to improve creative output is to provide others ' ideas as stimuli . For example , crowd workers were allowed to combine peers’ ideas ( Yu and Nickerson , 2011 ; Tanaka , Sakamoto and Kusumi , 2011 ) or to modify peers’ programming codes ( Gulley , 2001 ) , or to collaborate through wikis ( Blohm et al . , 2011 ) . However , the effect of being exposed to others’ ideas during crowdsourced idea generation is not well understood . In particular , the effect of stimulus originality on crowdsourced idea generation is unclear . The literature in psychology and design studies has generated inconsistent results on the effect of stimulus originality . Exposure to unusual examples has been shown to result in higher number of new concepts in engineering design ( Perttula and Sipila 2007 ) . By contrast , Fink et al . ( 2011 ) showed that the exposure to common ideas led to higher originality in generated ideas . Moreover , these studies all used multiple stimulus ideas . The effect of the interactions within a set of stimuli could have confounded the effect of the originality of the stimuli . This research investigates the effect of the originality of stimulus ideas in an online crowdsourcing environment . Originality is defined as the degree to which an idea is new and unusual ( Dean , Hender , Rodgers and Santanen , 2006 ) . Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to provide ideas for TV advertisements that would promote public transport as a way of saving the environment . The evaluation of such advertisements can arguably be performed by such workers because they are members of the broad targeted audience for the advertisements . There are three conditions in the experiment : the control condition with no idea exposure , the common condition with exposure to one common idea , and the original condition with exposure to an original idea . By comparing the number , originality and effectiveness of the generated ideas in the three conditions , the effect of the originality of stimulus ideas can be investigated systematically . In addition , the conformity effect , i . e . the degree to which people’s ideas conform to stimulus ideas , is studied for the common and the original conditions . We proceed by first discussing the theoretical foundations for this work , and then presenting the experiment design , methods and results . The implications for practice and further research are discussed afterwards . Wang et al . Crowdsourced Idea Generation Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Chicago , Illinois , August 15 - 17 , 2013 . 2 THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND HYPOTHESES In psychology , research has identified that idea generation involves a repeated search process in associative long term memory ( Nijstad and Stroebe , 2006 ) . Long term memory is proposed to consist of images , i . e . knowledge structures with a central concept and features or associations of the concept . The ideation process has two stages . The first stage is a search of long term memory based on cues - the cues can include the problem at hand or previous ideas or other stimuli - and the consequent activation of a certain image . The image is temporarily stored in working memory . In the second stage , ideas are generated using the features of the image through different operations , such as knowledge combination and applying knowledge to a new domain ( Nijstad and Stroebe , 2006 ) . According to this theory , we predict that showing original ( i . e . uncommon ) ideas to people may activate uncommon images and trigger other original ideas . This prediction is consistent with literature on priming , which suggests that priming makes certain knowledge or constructs more accessible ( Rietzschel , Nijstad and Stroebe , 2007 ) . Therefore , being primed with original ideas may help people access knowledge or constructs that are otherwise less accessible , which can in turn lead to more original ideas . Indeed , in an experiment where people generated solutions to the lack of campus parking , exposure to paradigm - modifying ideas led to a larger number of such ideas ( Garfield , Taylor , Dennis and Satzinger , 2001 ) . In addition , Perttula and Sipila ( 2007 ) showed that exposure to unusual examples led to a higher number of new concepts in engineering design . Therefore we expect that exposure to an original idea has positive effect on the originality of generated ideas : Originality Hypothesis : Exposure to an original idea increases the originality of generated ideas , as compared to having no idea exposure and having exposure to a common idea . There may be three reasons why exposure to original ideas affects the fluency of idea generation , that is , the number of ideas generated . First , original ideas may be less associative ( Dugosh and Paulus , 2005 ) . While common ideas typically are more representative of their categories , original ideas may be less representative and provide fewer associations ( Dugosh and Paulus , 2005 ) . Second , showing an original idea may set a high standard . Consequently , people may be reluctant to express ideas that they consider less novel . Third , when a stimulus idea is too original or bizarre , people may be less responsive to it . Responsiveness to stimuli is positively related to the similarity of the stimuli to one’s present cognitive state ( Coskun , Paulus , Brown and Sherwood , 2000 ) . While an idea of moderate originality can be stimulative , an idea that is too foreign for a person is less likely to be considered valid ( Stasser and Birchmeier , 2003 ) and to be further processed . Therefore , such bizarre ideas are less stimulative . These three reasons combined can lead to a negative effect on fluency : Fluency Hypothesis : Exposure to an original idea decreases the fluency of idea generation , as compared to having no idea exposure and having exposure to a common idea . As argued above , exposure to an idea activates relevant knowledge and increases access to related categories . Therefore , we expect generated ideas to be semantically close to stimulus ideas . This is consistent with the theory of structured imagination ( Ward , 1994 ) , which contends that idea generation is heavily based on existing solutions and constructs . Indeed , it was experimentally shown that brainstormers conformed to others’ ideas ( Kohn and Smith , 2011 ) . Likewise , two studies showed that exchanging ideas in electronic brainstorming reduced the number of domains of ideas ( Kohn and Smith , 2011 ; Ziegler , Diehl and Zijlstra , 2000 ) . Similarly , fixation effect was found in design : exposure to examples increases the number of features from the examples in the resulting design ( Jansson and Smith , 1991 ; Smith , Ward and Schumacher , 1993 ) . Furthermore , since original ideas may be less associative , it may be harder to fixate , i . e . to generate very similar ideas , in response to an original idea than to a common idea . Indeed , Perttula and Sipila ( 2007 ) showed that common examples led to more fixation than unusual examples in engineering design . This fixation is a kind of conformity : Conformity Hypothesis : Idea exposure leads to conformity in idea generation . The conformity effect is stronger if the stimulus idea is common , as opposed to original . METHOD US - based workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk were employed for generating and evaluating all the ideas . To obtain stimulus ideas , we first collected 120 ideas from 60 Amazon workers . The workers were instructed to provide ideas about TV advertisements for promoting public transport in order to contribute to a better environment and a sustainable society . Since single - dimension rating is less reliable for idea evaluation ( Riedl , Blohm , Leimeister and Krcmar , 2010 ) , we chose to measure both originality and effectiveness of the ideas . Each of the 120 ideas was evaluated ten times with regard to originality and effectiveness by another group of workers on 7 - point Likert scale , with 7 being most original / effective . To encourage cognitive effort , the workers were paid only if they explained why they selected certain scores . The ten scores for each idea were averaged to obtain the ratings on originality and effectiveness . Based on these ratings , two groups of thirty Wang et al . Crowdsourced Idea Generation Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Chicago , Illinois , August 15 - 17 , 2013 . 3 ideas , the original group and the common group , were selected to be stimulus ideas . The two groups were selected to exhibit no significant difference in effectiveness or length ( number of characters ) but to differ significantly with respect to originality , as shown in Table 1 . Variable The Original Group ( mean±SD ) The Common Group ( mean±SD ) P - value from T - test Originality ( scale : 1 - 7 ) 5 . 25±0 . 36 3 . 44±0 . 45 p < 0 . 001 Effectiveness ( scale : 1 - 7 ) 4 . 36±0 . 83 4 . 33±0 . 62 p = 0 . 860 Length 474±210 426±157 p = 0 . 318 Table 1 . The Stimulus Ideas in the Original Group and the Common Group The idea exposure study was designed as a between - subjects experiment with three conditions : the control condition , the common condition and the original condition . Participants were randomly assigned to each of the three conditions . In all conditions , the following instructions are shown . People can use either public transport or private transport in daily life . If many people switch from using private cars to using public transport systems , such as subway and bus systems , carbon emissions and air pollution can be reduced dramatically . We need you to design TV advertisements to encourage people to use public transport in order to contribute to a better environment and a sustainable society . All the designs will be evaluated later . The best 20 designs will be given a $ 1 bonus each . Each participant was paid $ 1 for the task . The number of workers who had professional experience with designing advertisements was low : 2 , 4 , and 2 in the control , common and original conditions , respectively . The workers were allowed to work for up to 30 minutes , but they usually spent less time ( M = 13 . 3 min , SD = 7 . 5 min ) . Because we expected that few would generate more than ten ideas , we provided ten text boxes , and therefore the maximum possible fluency was ten . Indeed 86 % of the workers generated less than 8 ideas . In the control condition , there was no idea exposure . In the common condition , each worker was shown one different idea from the common group . To ensure that every worker read the stimulus idea , the workers were required to summarize the stimulus idea in one sentence before generating their own ideas . In the original condition , the instructions were identical to the common condition except that each worker saw an idea from the original group . The 353 ideas generated were evaluated with regard to originality and effectiveness in the same way as mentioned before . Each of the steps above , including idea generation and idea evaluation , was carried out by a different group of workers . Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) was used to measure semantic distance between ideas ( Landauer and Dumais , 1997 ) . LSA represents all the ideas in a word by idea matrix where each word takes a row and each idea takes a column . Each cell in the matrix contains the frequency of the word in that idea . This matrix undergoes singular value decomposition and then only the factors that account for the most variance are used to obtain an approximation of the original matrix . This approximated matrix was used to calculate the pair - wise similarities of ideas by taking the vector cosine of the two ideas’ vectors . The sematic distance is calculated by subtracting the cosine similarity value , which ranges between - 1 and 1 , from 1 . The analysis was performed using the LSA package in R ( Wild 2011 ) . The English stop - words removal option was used , as well as the stemming option . All the stimulus ideas and the generated ideas were included in LSA to obtain a distance matrix that contained the semantic distance between all pairs of ideas . RESULTS There were 145 , 122 and 86 ideas generated in the control , common and original conditions , respectively . Table 2 summarizes the results for fluency , originality and effectiveness . The reliability of originality and effectiveness ratings , as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) , is good ( ICC = 0 . 70 and 0 . 63 for originality and effectiveness ratings , respectively ; p < 0 . 05 in both cases ) . There is a positive correlation between originality and effectiveness ( r = 0 . 218 , n = 353 , p = 3 . 67×10 - 5 ) . In addition , we averaged the originality of all ideas generated by each person and denoted it as average idea originality for each person . Wang et al . Crowdsourced Idea Generation Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Chicago , Illinois , August 15 - 17 , 2013 . 4 Because our first two hypotheses are concerned with fluency and originality , and since fluency is a characteristic of a person , not an idea , we treated fluency and average idea originality for each person as dependent variables and performed a one - way MANOVA test . It shows marginal difference across three conditions ( Pillai ' s trace = 0 . 102 , F ( 2 , 87 ) = 2 . 33 , p = 0 . 057 ) . One - way ANOVA shows no significant difference in either average idea originality for each person ( F ( 2 , 87 ) = 2 . 23 , p = 0 . 114 ) or idea originality ( F ( 2 , 350 ) = 1 . 78 , p = 0 . 171 ) . The average idea originality for each person in three conditions is shown in Figure 1 . The original condition resulted in marginally higher idea originality ( M = 4 . 07 , SD = 1 . 03 ) than the control condition ( M = 3 . 83 , SD = 1 . 08 ; t ( 186 ) = 1 . 70 , p = 0 . 091 ) . The original condition has significantly higher average idea originality for each person ( M = 4 . 30 , SD = 0 . 68 ) than the control condition ( M = 3 . 91 , SD = 0 . 68 ; t ( 58 ) = 2 . 22 , p = 0 . 031 ) . Idea originality of the common condition ( M = 4 . 01 , SD = 0 . 98 ) does not differ significantly from either the control condition ( t ( 263 ) = 1 . 42 , p = 0 . 158 ) or the original condition ( t ( 177 ) = 0 . 45 , p = 0 . 653 ) . Average idea originality for each person of the common condition ( M = 4 . 18 , SD = 0 . 82 ) does not differ significantly from either the control condition ( t ( 56 ) = 1 . 37 , p = 0 . 176 ) or the original condition ( t ( 56 ) = 0 . 63 , p = 0 . 533 ) . Thus the benefit of idea exposure on originality occurred only when the stimulus was original , although the advantage of showing an original idea over showing a common idea was insignificant . These results partially support the originality hypothesis . Table 2 . Data from the Idea Exposure Experiment Figure 1 . Average Idea Originality for Each Person in Different Conditions . Error bars indicate standard error . Because people are usually interested in top ideas , comparisons were also performed on the most original ideas . The 30 most original ideas in all 353 ideas are distributed in the following way : 10 are from the control condition , 11 are from the common condition and 9 are from the original condition . A chi - square test shows no difference among conditions ( χ 2 ( 2 , N = 30 ) = 0 . 2 , p = 0 . 905 ) . A one - way ANOVA for the 30 highest idea originality scores from each of the three conditions shows no significant difference ( F ( 2 , 87 ) = 1 . 35 , p = 0 . 264 ) . Therefore , when we consider only the most original ideas , there is Variable The Control Condition ( mean±SD ) The Common Condition ( mean±SD ) The Original Condition ( mean±SD ) Results from One - way ANOVA Fluency ( range : 1 - 10 ) 4 . 83±3 . 05 4 . 07±2 . 96 2 . 87±2 . 19 F ( 2 , 87 ) = 3 . 87 , p = 0 . 025 Originality ( scale : 1 - 7 ) 3 . 83±1 . 08 4 . 01±0 . 98 4 . 07±1 . 03 F ( 2 , 350 ) = 1 . 78 , p = 0 . 171 Effectiveness ( scale : 1 - 7 ) 4 . 00±0 . 88 3 . 94±0 . 83 4 . 10±0 . 99 F ( 2 , 350 ) = 0 . 536 , p = 0 . 586 Wang et al . Crowdsourced Idea Generation Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Chicago , Illinois , August 15 - 17 , 2013 . 5 no significant difference across conditions . The idea effectiveness does not differ across the three conditions according to ANOVA ( F ( 2 , 350 ) = 0 . 536 , p = 0 . 586 ) . Tests of the fluency hypothesis are now described . The fluency in three conditions is shown in Figure 2 . A one - way ANOVA shows a significant difference for fluency in three conditions ( F ( 2 , 87 ) = 3 . 87 , p = 0 . 025 ) . Fluency differs strongly between the control condition ( mean = 4 . 83 , SD = 3 . 05 ) and the original condition ( mean = 2 . 87 , SD = 2 . 19 ; t ( 52 . 6 ) = 2 . 87 , p = 0 . 006 ) . Fluency in the original condition is also marginally smaller than in the common condition ( mean = 4 . 07 , SD = 2 . 96 ; t ( 53 . 5 ) = 1 . 78 , p = 0 . 080 ) . Fluency does not differ significantly between the control condition and the common condition ( t ( 57 . 9 ) = 0 . 988 , p = 0 . 327 ) . Therefore , the fluency hypothesis is partially supported . All three conditions combined , average idea originality for each person and fluency are negatively correlated ( r ( 88 ) = - . 33 , p < . 01 ) . Figure 2 . Fluency in Different Conditions . Error bars indicate standard error . The conformity effect indicates that an idea generated upon idea exposure should be semantically closer to its corresponding stimulus idea than the ideas generated without idea exposure . For each stimulus idea , two distances were calculated . First , the LSA distances between the stimulus idea and all the ideas generated upon its exposure were averaged ( we will refer to the distance as S2G , stimulus to generated ideas distance ) . Second , the distances from the stimulus idea to all the ideas in the control condition were averaged ( we will refer to the distance as S2C , stimulus to control distance ) . Figure 3 illustrates these calculations . Paired - samples t - test of S2G ( M = 0 . 805 , SD = 0 . 134 ) and S2C ( M = 0 . 858 , SD = 0 . 042 ) for the common condition suggests that the ideas generated upon idea exposure may be semantically closer to their corresponding stimulus ideas than the ideas in the control condition ( t ( 29 ) = 1 . 963 , p = 0 . 059 ) . The same thing can be said for the original condition ( S2C : M = 0 . 876 , SD = 0 . 05 ; S2G : M = 0 . 836 , SD = 0 . 112 ; t ( 29 ) = 1 . 972 , p = 0 . 058 ) . We thought that the first idea generated upon idea exposure might be more similar to the stimulus than the remaining generated ideas , so , for the common condition , we performed a paired - samples t - test of S2C and the distance between the stimulus ideas and the first generated ideas ( S2G1 : M = 0 . 783 , SD = 0 . 171 ) ; this showed a significant difference ( t ( 29 ) = 2 . 306 , p = 0 . 028 ) . This indicates that the first ideas generated in the common condition are significantly more similar to the corresponding stimulus ideas than the ideas in the control condition . The same comparison for the original condition shows only marginal difference ( S2G1 : M = 0 . 832 , SD = 0 . 136 ; t ( 29 ) = 1 . 746 , p = 0 . 091 ) . Therefore , the conformity effect , as measured by LSA distance , is likely to exist . In addition , the conformity of the first idea generated is more salient in the common condition than in the original condition . In short , the conformity hypothesis is partially supported . Wang et al . Crowdsourced Idea Generation Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Chicago , Illinois , August 15 - 17 , 2013 . 6 Figure 3 . Calculations on LSA Distances . The distance between two ideas in the semantic space indicates the dissimilarity between the two ideas . The LSA distances between a stimulus idea and all the ideas in the control condition are averaged to obtain S2C ( stimulus to control distance ) . The LSA distances between a stimulus idea and all the ideas generated upon its exposure are averaged to obtain S2G ( stimulus to generated ideas distance ) . S2G1 is the LSA distance from a stimulus to the first idea generated upon its exposure . DISCUSSION In this experiment , idea generation under three conditions is compared : idea generation with no idea exposure , with exposure to a common idea and with exposure to an original idea . The originality hypothesis is partially supported . The average idea originality for each person does increase significantly in the original condition , as compared to the control condition . However , idea originality is only marginally higher in the original condition than in the control condition . The positive effect on originality may be diluted when we consider individual ideas since people are usually more fluent in generating common ideas . Another reason for the inadequate originality increase may be the difficulty in being original in general and the difficulty in being responsive to original ideas . The difficulty might be more severe in a crowdsourcing environment due to a relative lack of training in creative idea generation and / or a lack of motivation . Therefore , while being exposed to an original idea has a positive effect in crowdsourcing , more measures should be taken to fully take advantage of idea exposure . The fluency hypothesis is partially supported in that fluency decreases upon exposure to an original idea , as compared to having no idea exposure . This is an interesting finding because previous studies showed that idea exposure increases productivity in electronic brainstorming ( Dugosh et al . , 2000 ; Dugosh and Paulus , 2005 ) . It should be noted that our task was technically not a brainstorming task because no brainstorming rules were presented . However , in a non - brainstorming drawing study , the exposure to examples did not affect the number of drawings significantly ( Marsh , Landau and Hicks , 1996 ) . By contrast , this study shows that exposure to an original idea has a strong negative effect on ideational fluency . It needs to be noted that all previous studies on idea exposure used multiple stimuli while ours used only one , so it is possible that multiplicity of stimuli counteracts the negative effect resulted from original stimuli . Since idea originality does increase marginally in the original condition , it is possible that the original stimuli set a higher standard for idea originality , which may discourage fluency . We do need to note that fluency has an upper limit of ten in this study . There are 6 , 4 , and 2 participants who generated 10 ideas in the control , common and original conditions , respectively . This means some people might have generated more ideas . However , since the control condition has the most people who generated ten ideas , if there had been no fluency limit , the fluency difference might have been even larger . Therefore the support for our fluency hypothesis might have been stronger . Wang et al . Crowdsourced Idea Generation Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems , Chicago , Illinois , August 15 - 17 , 2013 . 7 The conformity hypothesis is partially supported . There is likely a conformity effect because the semantic distances to the stimuli decrease marginally upon idea exposure for both the common and the original conditions . However , the proposed difference in conformity effect between the common and the original conditions only exists for the first idea generated . This suggests that common stimuli lead to ideas of higher conformity at the beginning of ideation . But considering all the ideas generated throughout the whole session , the overall level of conformity is independent of the stimulus originality . First , it is reasonable that common ideas may lead to more conformity instantly . Original stimuli , by their nature , are semantically further away from other ideas , which may result in a difficulty in making associations and modifications . Second , the difference in the level of conformity may fade away in time . In the common condition , when people keep generating ideas , they are often able to explore new semantic categories , and therefore reduce conformity . This notion is consistent with the finding that examples can induce conformity without blocking the generation of original ideas ( Marsh et al . , 1996 ) . Still we need to point out that LSA is not a perfect measure of semantic distance . The results could be strengthened by using alternative measures of semantic distance , as well as qualitative analysis on the texts . The results from this research indicate that showing people an original idea may increase originality but reduces fluency . To further take advantage of idea exposure , there are two measures worth considering . First , being exposed to more than one idea might increase both idea originality and fluency . Multiple stimuli provide more possibilities for associations , modifications and combinations and therefore better chance to ideate fluently . Multiple stimuli may also result in reduction in fixation on any one idea , or deep exploration of certain domain knowledge both of which can lead to original ideas ( Rietzschel et al . , 2007 ) . Second , idea exposure may be more helpful in the later stage of ideation when people have run out of new ideas ( Kohn , Paulus and Choi , 2011 ) . These two considerations warrant further research . The research also has some practical implications . Sometimes we need large amount of ideas , such as in early stage of crowd idea generation . In this case not showing others’ ideas or showing common ideas is preferable to showing people original ones . When idea originality is critical and when the cost of idea selection is high , it is preferable to show people original ideas because it may increase idea originality and reduce fluency , leading to higher proportion of original ideas . But further research is needed . Specifically , most creativity studies , including this one , face a methodological difficulty . Judgment of fluency is easy to make , but judgment of an idea’s quality is difficult to make . Ideally , studies such as this one should be continued so that ideas that surface in the early stages of innovation are implemented and tested . In the case of advertisements , such studies of idea effectiveness in the real world are possible , and thus present an avenue for future research . CONCLUSION This research studied the effect of exposure to an original or common idea on crowdsourced idea generation using a realistic task , the design of an ad . As compared to a condition with no idea exposure , exposure to an original idea increased the average idea originality for each person but decreased fluency , while exposure to a common idea had no effect on either idea originality or fluency . None of the two treatments influenced idea effectiveness . The first idea generated conformed more to a common stimulus idea than to an original stimulus idea . However , the overall level of conformity does not appear different for the two situations . These results suggest further research , as well as provide some insights in designing idea generation systems for use by crowds .
