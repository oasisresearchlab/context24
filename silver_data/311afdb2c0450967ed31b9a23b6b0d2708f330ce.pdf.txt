The antioxidant potential of carotenoids is of particular significance to human health , due to the fact that losing antioxidant - reactive oxygen species balance results in “oxidative stress” , a critical factor of the pathogenic processes of various chronic disorders .

Introduction Carotenoids ( Crts ) are structurally and functionally a very diverse group of natural pigments of the polyene type [ 1 ] . They occur ubiquitously in all organisms capable of conducting photosynthesis , a process in which sun light is effectively converted into chemical energy . Carotenoids are important constituents of photosynthetic organelles of all higher plants , mosses , ferns and algae . They are also found in photosynthetic membranes of phototropic bacteria and cyanobacteria [ 2 ] . Although not synthesized by humans and animals , they are also present in their blood and tissues . They are important precursors of retinol ( vitamin A ) ; however , their main function in all non - photosynthetic organisms seems to be ( photo ) protection . Carotenoids are known to be very efficient physical and chemical quenchers of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) , as well as potent scavengers of other reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) [ 3 – 5 ] . This is of special significance , because the uncontrolled generation and concomitant increase of ROS level in the body results in “oxidative stress” , an essential contributor to the pathogenic processes of many diseases . Carotenoids and some of their metabolites are suggested to play a protective role in a number of ROS - mediated disorders , such as , i . e . , cardiovascular diseases , several types of cancer or neurological , as well as photosensitive or eye - related disorders . However , due to numerous factors affecting the bioavailability , absorption , transport , metabolism or storage of Crts , the exact mechanisms of their functioning in vivo are still far from being fully understood . In the present paper , based on the data coming from epidemiological and intervention studies , as well as clinical trials , we would like to highlight the beneficial effects of Crts intake , either as supplements or as integral components of Crt - rich food , in several exemplary modern civilization diseases . 2 . Carotenoids : Short Overview Up to date , more than 700 Crts have been described [ 6 ] , of which about 50 become constituents of the human diet [ 7 ] , while only ~ 20 are present in human blood and tissues [ 8 ] . The most important include β - carotene , α - carotene , lycopene , lutein , zeaxanthin , β - cryptoxanthin , α - cryptoxanthin , γ - carotene , neurosporene , ζ - carotene , phytofluene and phytoene ( Figure 1 ) , all present in human plasma [ 7 , 9 ] . 2 . 1 . Chemical Structure , Function and Membrane Distribution Most Crts exhibit a characteristic , symmetrical tetraterpene skeleton formed by the tail - to - tail linkage of the two C 20 moieties . The linear C 40 hydrocarbon backbone is susceptible to diverse structural modifications . These concern modifications in hydrogenation level , cis - trans isomerization , cyclization at one or both ends or the addition of side groups ( often containing oxygen ) with their subsequent glycosylation / acetylation . More sophisticated changes are related to the shortening or extension of the carbon skeleton resulting , in the latter case , in C 50 - Crts formation . Moreover , C 30 - Crts might be formed as products of two farnesyl units of condensation [ 1 ] . One of the most characteristic features of Crts is their strong coloration , which is a consequence of light absorption stemming from the presence of an extensive system of conjugated double bonds . The presence of such a conjugated chain is crucial for the proper functioning of Crts , which is essentially light absorption in photosynthetic organisms and ( photo ) protection in all living organisms . Carotenoids are also suggested Nutrients 2014 , 6 468 to participate in : ( i ) the stimulation of the immune system ; ( ii ) the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways ( gap junction communication ) [ 10 ] ; ( iii ) the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis ; ( iv ) the modulation of growth factors ; ( v ) cell differentiation [ 11 ] ; and ( vi ) the modulation of various types of receptors or adhesion molecules and many other physiologically significant processes [ 12 ] . Figure 1 .

Strict hydrocarbons , such as β - carotene or lycopene , are arranged exclusively within the inner part of the lipid bilayer . “More” polar pigment molecules , containing attached oxygen atoms ( e . g . , lutein , zeaxanthin ) are oriented roughly perpendicular to the membrane surface , exhibiting their hydrophilic parts to the aqueous environment [ 13 , 14 ] . Incorporation of Crts may noticeably affect the membranes’ properties ( rigidity , mechanical strength , thickness , fluidity or permeability ) , which are crucial for their proper functioning . For example , stability and some other membrane - associated processes , such as signal transduction , are modified [ 15 – 17 ] . Subsequent changes may also result in a prominent enhancement of the membranes’ resistance toward ROS , having a positive impact on human health , since the molecular mechanism of a number of chronic diseases seems to at least partly involve ROS interactions . 2 . 2 . Bioavailability and Fate in Human Body Carotenoids are abundantly present in fresh fruits and vegetables . Yellow - orange - red fruits and green leafy vegetables are known to be especially rich in nutritional Crts . The major dietary sources of Crts have been listed recently [ 18 – 20 ] . However , as pointed out by Castenmiller and West [ 21 ] or Yeum and Russell [ 22 ] , there is a number of factors that influence Crts bioavailability , absorption , breakdown , transport and storage . The type , amount and milieu in which Crts are incorporated belong to the most evident factors . Thus , Crts release from the food matrix greatly depends on their state , as well as association with other compounds ( i . e . , proteins ) [ 23 ] . The microcrystalline form of some Crts ( e . g . , lycopene in tomato or β - carotene in carrot ) makes them less available as compared to those which are entirely immersed in lipid droplets . It is suggested that only about 5 % of the Crts in whole are absorbed by the intestine , whereas > 50 % are from micellar solution [ 24 ] . In a number of studies , thermal treatment was shown to increase Crts accessibility , due to the disruption of cell walls and bond loosening [ 25 , 26 ] . Other factors , such as genetic factors and nutritional status , gender , aging or infection , also determine Crt bioavailability [ 21 , 22 ] . It is well - established that any disease with the abnormal absorption of fat from the digestive tract significantly affects Crts incorporation . Furthermore , interactions with drugs ( e . g . , sulfonamides or aspirin ) were shown to decrease the availability of β - carotene [ 21 ] . Last , but not least , the interactions between different types of Crts and other food components play an important role . For example , Crts may interact with each other during absorption , metabolism and serum clearance , as was demonstrated during β - carotene and lutein administration to human subjects [ 27 ] . Another example might be the “positive” cooperation between Crts and vitamin E ( see Section 4 , “ROS : Antioxidants Balance” ) . The intestinal absorption of Crts , which are highly hydrophobic molecules , involves similar stages as in the case of dietary lipids or fat - soluble vitamins . This includes : ( i ) the incorporation into mixed lipid micelles in the lumen ; ( ii ) the uptake into intestinal mucosa ; ( iii ) the incorporation into chylomicrons ; and ( iv ) the release into the lymph [ 28 , 29 ] . Following the digestion of chylomicrons by lipoprotein lipase and the release of Crts , they are further distributed mostly by the use of ( very ) low density lipoproteins ( ( V ) LDL ) [ 8 , 30 ] . Thus , the low density proteins ( LDL ) exhibit , among others , the highest concentration of Crts in plasma [ 7 , 24 , 31 ] . Carotenoids are mainly accumulated in the liver and adipose tissues ; however , their relatively high amount was also reported for the adrenal gland , corpus luteum , testes , skin and retina Nutrients 2014 , 6 470 ( macula ) in contrary to kidney and ovary , while in brain stem tissue , their concentration was below the detection limit [ 32 , 33 ] . 3 . Reactive Oxygen Species 3 . 1 . Major Cellular Sources of ROS Life on Earth depends on molecular oxygen , which , in all aerobic cells , is primarily utilized by specialized organelles , mitochondria , in a basic biochemical process called oxidative phosphorylation . Due to the operation in an oxygen - rich environment , the protein components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain , the elements of the citric acid cycle , together with some other enzymes ( e . g . , monoamine oxidase or manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) ) are considered as major mitochondrial sources of ROS [ 34 – 37 ] . The other sites of cellular ROS production include microsomes , peroxisomes or cytochrome P450 . In addition , some cytosolic enzymes , for instance copper / zinc superoxide dismutase ( Cu / ZnSOD ) , xanthin oxidase , cytochrome P450 reductase or NADPH oxidases ( NOX family ) , have been recognized as potent ROS generators [ 38 , 39 ] . Apart from these , a number of exogenous physical and chemical factors , such as UV and ionizing radiation ( e . g . , X - rays ) or chemical compounds ( e . g . , xenobiotics ) are also known to be responsible for the stimulation of cellular ROS ( or reactive nitrogen species , RNS ) formation [ 40 ] . 3 . 2 . Types of ROS A great variety of reactive oxygen - derived species are continuously generated in cells . They are capable of irreversible oxidation of fundamental biological macromolecules : proteins , lipids , nucleic acids and carbohydrates [ 41 , 42 ] . Radicals , such as the superoxide anion radical ( O 2• − ) or the hydroxyl radical ( HO• ) , and reactive non - radical species , such as hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) or singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) , are among the most abundant species . The superoxide anion radical is regarded as one of the most powerful and destructive . Because of the ubiquitous presence of the mitochondrial transport chain , it is considered as the major physiological source of O 2• − . Thus , the formation of O 2• − occurs during the transportation of the electron to oxygen in the respiratory chain by previously reduced coenzymes , prosthetic groups or even xenobiotics [ 43 ] . It was found that mitochondria can generate as much as 2 – 3 nmol of O 2 • − / min per mg of protein [ 35 ] . The superoxide radical may also be generated enzymatically by respective NADPH oxidases [ 39 , 44 , 45 ] or the xanthine oxidase system . The superoxide anion radical , a relatively short - lived oxygen species [ 46 ] , quickly undergoes further reactions that result in the formation of a set of other ROS ( Figure 2 ) . It may undergo dismutation to H 2 O 2 and O 2 , either spontaneously or in the reaction catalyzed by MnSOD or Cu / ZnSOD in the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic matrix , respectively [ 47 ] . The superoxide anion radical may also react with nitric oxide ( NO ) to form a short - lived , but powerful , oxidant , peroxynitrite ( ONOO – ) , capable of interactions with lipids , nucleic acids and proteins via direct oxidative reactions or radical - mediated mechanisms [ 48 ] . Furthermore , O 2• − reduces transition metals , such as iron or copper , which in the Fenton reaction together with H 2 O 2 lead to the formation of HO• . The hydroxyl radical is famous for its extreme reactivity and harmfulness . Its lifetime was estimated to be ~ 2 ns in aqueous solution and its radius of diffusion ~ 20 Å [ 46 , 49 ] . Hydroxyl radical interacts with the adjacent molecules leading to Nutrients 2014 , 6 471 their rapid oxidation . It is capable of reducing disulfide bonds and , as a consequence , protein unfolding . Its role in other deleterious processes has also been reported [ 50 ] . Figure 2 . Schematic presentation of a cascade of reactions resulting in the formation of a set of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) from the superoxide anion radical . SOD , superoxide dismutase ; MPO , myeloperoxidase ; HXO , hypohalous acid ; PUFA , polyunsaturated fatty acid ; ROO• , peroxyl radical ; ROOH , hydroperoxide species . Another reactive species , H 2 O 2 , an example of the long - lived ROS , apart from being formed from O 2• − , can also be generated directly during electron transport in mitochondria . As was estimated by Chance et al . [ 51 ] , under physiological conditions , the amount of H 2 O 2 generated by the mitochondrial electron transport chain corresponds to ~ 2 % of the initial oxygen uptake . Boveris et al . [ 52 ] demonstrated that in rat liver , the contribution of H 2 O 2 produced in the mitochondria , microsome , peroxisome and some enzymes to the cytosolic level of H 2 O 2 at a pO 2 of 158 mmHg accounts for 15 % , 45 % , 35 % and 5 % , respectively . Hydrogen peroxide is also generated as a side product during enzymatic reactions ( vide xanthin oxidase formation ) . It also serves as a substrate for myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) in a reaction leading to hypohalous acid ( HXO ) , which may further react with H 2 O 2 , which leads to 1 O 2 formation [ 38 ] . Hydrogen peroxide is regarded as a mild oxidant ; however , it is able to oxidize cysteine residues in proteins [ 53 ] . Another example of non - radical ROS is 1 O 2 . Singlet oxygen can be generated non - photochemically via an “oxidative burst” , a process in which macrophages , neutrophils or monocytes produce large amounts of ROS during phagocytosis [ 54 , 55 ] . Its lifetime was shown to be strongly medium - dependent and estimated in the range of 10 − 6 – 10 − 5 s [ 46 , 56 ] . Singlet oxygen predominantly interacts with double - bonded molecules ( nucleic acids , polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) ) via energy transfer or chemical reactions [ 57 ] . Peroxyl radicals ( ROO• ) also constitute a very important type of ROS . They are generated during lipid auto - oxidation ( usually initiated by HO• ) , which is an example of a chain - reaction [ 58 ] . The lifetime of ROO• was shown to be relatively long ( ~ 7 s ) and the diffusion radius significant [ 46 ] .

E ROOH Nutrients 2014 , 6 472 The process of lipid peroxidation might be terminated by various lipophilic antioxidants ( e . g . , vitamin E ) [ 59 ] . Such a reaction results in the formation of hydroperoxide species ( ROOH ) [ 60 ] , which , in turn , may rearrange to form endoperoxides and , further , metabolites , which are capable of interacting with neighboring proteins . 4 . ROS : Antioxidants Balance Reactive oxygen species are first and foremost described as potentially harmful agents . However , on the other hand , ROS are also known to serve positive , regulatory functions [ 61 ] . Their role in intracellular and extracellular signaling processes has already been well documented [ 62 ] . To give an example , the mitochondrial ROS generation is regarded as a component of the TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) - signal transduction pathway during apoptosis [ 63 ] . Reactive oxygen species may also interfere with the expression of genes [ 62 ] or influence protein phosphorylation [ 53 ] . In some cases , ROS might be regarded as “protective” molecules having a positive impact on inflammation [ 64 , 65 ] . The amount of cellular ROS is kept under strict control . Each cell has a powerful defense system , a palette of diverse antioxidative molecules operating in its hydrophilic or hydrophobic environment , capable of eliminating potentially dangerous species . The type and complexity of antioxidants decide their efficiency in ROS scavenging . In some cases , they can even prevent the formation of ROS precursors . The most obvious group of antioxidants comprise enzymes , such as , for instance , those from the SOD family catalyzing conversion of O 2• − into H 2 O 2 . H 2 O 2 , depending on the place of its origin , might be decomposed either by one of the glutathione peroxidases [ 66 ] or by catalases abundant in peroxisomes or heart mitochondria . Interestingly , such catalases have not been found in the mitochondria of other tissues [ 67 ] . Another group of antioxidants include vitamins . Vitamin E ( primarily α - tocopherol ) is regarded as a very efficient antioxidant functioning in a hydrophobic milieu [ 68 ] . It is known to inhibit lipid peroxidation and to scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals , preventing the propagation of free radical - mediated chain reactions [ 59 ] . Furthermore , its ability to quench 1 O 2 or reaction with peroxynitrite have been described . As was communicated for the first time by Palozza and Krinsky [ 69 , 70 ] , β - carotene and α - tocopherol can act synergistically as an effective “radical - trapping antioxidant” in biological membranes . The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by a combination of the two fat - soluble antioxidants was shown to be greater than the sum of the individual inhibitions . In another study [ 71 ] , oxygen - containing Crt , zeaxanthin and α - tocopherol were demonstrated to deliver synergistic protection against photosensitized lipid peroxidation mediated by 1 O 2 and free radicals . The cooperation between hydrophilic ascorbic acid ( vitamin C , reducing agent ) , hydrophobic α - tocopherol ( vitamin E ) and β - carotene ( provitamin A ) also led to synergistic cell protection against different RNS [ 72 ] . Furthermore , inorganic elements ( e . g . , selenium ) and low - molecular weight organic compounds ( e . g . , coenzyme Q , uric acid , lipoic acid ) are considered as important antioxidant molecules [ 73 – 76 ] . A special group of antioxidants consists of plant - derivate compounds , carotenoids and flavonoids . Carotenoids are regarded as one of the most efficient 1 O 2 quenchers , as well as ROS scavengers operating in cellular lipid bilayers [ 77 ] . Flavonoids , although shown to be very potent scavengers of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals , as well as active chelators of transient elements [ 78 , 79 ] , due to their relatively poor absorption and difficulties with storage in Nutrients 2014 , 6 473 animal tissues , are thought to have a lower contribution to the direct antioxidative protection of humans [ 80 – 82 ] . A lose in balance between ROS generation and detoxification leading to ROS overproduction and , as a consequence , accumulation , may result in a range of abnormalities further associated with chronic diseases . The most common include cancer , cardiovascular diseases , photosensitivity disorders , diabetes , neurological disorders or various types of inflammation , as well as processes correlated with ageing ( Figure 3 ) [ 48 , 82 – 84 ] . Therefore , compounds capable of preventing the excessive formation of ROS , thus regulating their concentration , are of special importance to human health . Figure 3 . Examples of ROS - mediated disorders . The orange color indicates the beneficial effect of carotenoids on disease risk development . The yellow color indicates that an equivocal effect was reported . The diagram was constructed on the basis of information from several studies cited within the text . 5 . Carotenoids : ROS Interactions Carotenoids are very potent natural antioxidants . Due to their triplet energy levels lying close to that of 1 O 2 ( 1274 nm , 7849 cm − 1 or 93 . 9 kJ / mole vs . 1380 nm , 7250 cm − 1 or 86 . 7 kJ / mol for β - carotene , respectively [ 2 , 85 ] ) , they belong to the most efficient physical quenchers of 1 O 2 , both in vitro and in vivo [ 4 , 86 , 87 ] . The process of 1 O 2 quenching has been shown to be very efficient , especially for Crts having 11 conjugated double bonds ( ≈ 10 10 M − 1 ·s − 1 ) [ 77 ] , though their protective behavior was demonstrated to be strongly medium - dependent [ 88 , 89 ] . In general , 1 O 2 deactivation is based on the conversion of an excess of energy to heat via the Crt lowest excited triplet state ( 3 Crt * ) .

Moreover , they effectively scavenge ROS and other free radicals of different origins [ 4 , 91 – 95 ] , delivering protection against oxidative damage to photosynthetic and non - photosynthetic organisms at all levels of complexity . There are three generally accepted major types of reactions of free radical scavenging by Crts : ( i ) electron transfer between the free radical ( R • ) and Crt , resulting in the formation of a Crt radical cation ( Crt • + ) ( Equation 3 ) or Crt radical anion ( Crt • − ) ( Equation 4 ) ; ( ii ) radical adduct formation ( RCrt • ) ( Equation 5 ) ; and ( iii ) hydrogen atom transfer leading to a neutral Crt radical ( Crt • ) ( Equation 6 ) [ 4 , 60 ] . R • + Crt → R − + Crt • + ( 3 ) R • + Crt → R + + Crt • − ( 4 ) R • + Crt → RCrt • ( 5 ) R • + Crt → RH + Crt • ( 6 ) The newly formed Crt radical products can undergo further transformations , leading to a variety of secondary Crt derivatives of different reactivity . This is of extreme importance , due to the fact that the newly generated Crt species may no longer act as efficient antioxidants , but turn into potentially harmful , pro - oxidant agents . For instance , one of the most studied Crt reactive species , Crt • + , due to its strong oxidizing properties and relatively long lifetime ( ms ) [ 96 , 97 ] , is known to be able to interact with other molecules of biological importance , e . g . , tyrosine or cysteine ( k ~ 10 4 and 10 6 M − 1 ·s − 1 , respectively ) [ 98 ] . In vivo , the oxidation of amino acids may result in irreversible structural modifications of proteins and , thus , markedly influence their proper functioning . Moreover , the scavenging ability of Crts toward free radical species was shown to be strongly dependent on their redox properties [ 99 ] , which might be modified by the presence of salts , as has been exemplified with astaxanthin [ 100 ] . In the presence of salts , its relative antioxidant ability was demonstrated to decrease as its oxidation potential decreases . The presence of salts also influenced the stability of astaxanthin radical cations and dications . 6 . Oxidative Stress , Disease and Carotenoids Oxidative stress is placed among the most important causes of a range of modern chronic civilization diseases . Nevertheless , there is growing evidence that antioxidants , such as Crts , may reduce or , in some cases , even prevent the development of various ROS - mediated disorders . Data coming from observational , epidemiological and intervention studies , as well as clinical trials usually support this view , although some of them are equivocal . Nutrients 2014 , 6 475 6 . 1 . Cancer According to the World Health Organization [ 101 ] , cancer is a primary cause of death and accounted for around 13 % of all deaths in 2008 . It is predicted that the deaths from tumors will continue to rise to over 11 million in the year 2030 . Therefore , it is so important to take adequate steps to reduce or modify the factors affecting the risk of cancer development . Undoubtedly , the simplest one seems to be the sufficient intake of fruits and vegetables rich in biologically active compounds [ 101 ] . A number of prospective studies have shown a positive correlation between the consumption of Crt - rich fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of several types of cancer [ 102 – 105 ] . Thus , a large collection of data on lung cancer and dietary Crts have become available . The results usually support the observation of decreased morbidity upon β - carotene supplementation in non - smoking adults [ 106 , 107 ] . Furthermore , the recent case - control studies of diet and lung cancer among non - smokers confirmed an inverse correlation between lung cancer risk and intakes of food sources rich in Crts , such as α - carotene , lutein , lycopene , β - cryptoxanthin and β - carotene [ 108 , 109 ] . In contrast to this , the results obtained from the Alpha - Tocopherol , Beta - Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial ( ATBC ) , involving heavy cigarette smoking men , indicated a significantly higher occurrence of lung cancer and total mortality in comparison to individuals obtaining the placebo [ 110 ] . These results were confirmed by the Beta - Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial ( CARET ) study , as well as some others , in which a combination of β - carotene and vitamin A supplementation was tested among men and women at a high risk of developing lung cancer ( asbestos workers and smokers ) and in subjects who consumed larger amounts of alcohol [ 111 – 113 ] . Yet , in the course of the latest detailed analyses of the results , it turns out that the unexpected “cancerogenic” ( pro - oxidant ) effects of Crt supplementation can be explained in terms of their strong interference with the unhealthy lifestyle of the individuals [ 114 ] . Another important collection of data comes from the studies on prostate cancer . Thus , a large number of epidemiological studies generally support the idea that several Crts , as well as Crt - rich food , could be involved in the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer [ 115 , 116 ] . Among various Crts , lycopene is regarded as the most potent agent against the risk of this type of tumor , in particular in its more lethal form [ 117 ] . The preclinical studies suggest several possible ways of lycopene action , indicating , at the same time , its significance in the enhancement of the oxidation stress defense system [ 118 ] . Further evidence supporting the above findings has been delivered by the recent meta - analysis of the observational studies on the role of tomato products and lycopene in the prevention of prostate cancer [ 119 ] . Furthermore , recent human intervention and clinical trials provided additional support [ 120 , 121 ] . The human intervention trials point to β - carotene as an important factor in the prevention of oral , pharynx and larynx cancers [ 122 ] . These data are in agreement with further observations that high consumption of fruits and vegetables results in the reduction of the risk of oral and throat cancers by about 50 % . The prospective studies confirmed the results [ 123 ] . Similar data were obtained in the case of esophageal cancer . In several case - control studies , it was shown that fairly high consumption of fruits and vegetables resulted in 40 % – 50 % lower risk of this type of cancer in comparison to low intakes [ 124 ] . Furthermore , a large body of evidence , mostly from observational studies , indicates a correlation between the intake of fruits and vegetables and the risk for colon cancer Nutrients 2014 , 6 476 development [ 125 , 126 ] . Similarly , the case - control studies confirm the inverse relation between fruits / vegetable intake , serum concentration of Crts and colon cancer risk . 6 . 2 . Cardiovascular and Related Disorders Carotenoids , as highly lipophilic molecules , are expected to be particularly efficient scavengers of ROS within the hydrophobic parts of cell membranes and lipoproteins , their major transporters , reducing the possibility of the oxidation of membrane structures and the overall risk of the morbidity rate [ 127 ] . One of the classical examples of an ROS - mediated disorder is atherosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) , which is the result of oxidative modification of LDL in the arterial walls leading to coronary heart disease [ 128 ] . Due to the abundance of this kind of disorder , the investigations on factors that may prevent or delay its development are of special importance . The results of the studies of the association of Crts ( mainly β - carotene , α - carotene , lycopene , lutein , zeaxanthin and β - cryptoxanthin ) with the risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis have been summarized by Mayne [ 129 ] and more recently by Voutilainen et al . [ 130 ] . On the basis of the reported data , the authors point out that there is a positive correlation between the higher intake of fruits and vegetables rich in Crts and the prevention of morbidity and mortality with relation to cardiovascular disease . The results from intervention studies are less consistent . Thus , the results of the well - known studies conducted by the ATBC Trial , primarily designed to evaluate the effect of β - carotene on lung cancer and other types of cancer in male smokers [ 110 ] , also delivered data on ischemic heart disease , stroke mortality and first major coronary events . In this case , the supplementation of 20 mg / day of β - carotene over six years resulted in an insignificant increase of ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality . As was later shown by Tornwall et al . [ 131 ] , it also increased the post - trial risk of a first nonfatal myocardial infarction . Supplementation of a larger amount of β - carotene ( 50 mg / day ) to adult non - smoking males and females delivered no evidence for cardiovascular disease mortality [ 132 , 133 ] . Furthermore , no confirmation of any relation between β - carotene intake and the five - year mortality after supplementation nor the incidence of any type of cardiovascular disease was reported by the Heart Protection Study ( HPS ) [ 134 ] . During the five - year studies , the male and female individuals with a previously diagnosed coronary heart disease , an occlusive arterial disease or diabetes were under close inspection . In this case , the increased risk of a fatal coronary event was reported only for male smokers with previously stated myocardial infarction [ 135 ] . The positive effects of β - carotene supplementation ( additionally with or without aspirin ) were also reported for individuals with ischemic heart disease . In this case , a significant reduction of a myocardial infarction risk was shown [ 132 ] . Results from the basic research , clinical and intervention studies are not consistent . They contradict each other very often . In some cases , a beneficial effect of β - carotene on cardiovascular disease has been clearly observed ; in others , little or no correlation between them has been found or , even , an inverse relationship has been reported . This unexpected Crt behavior might be partially explained in terms of : ( i ) the generation of Crts oxygenation products of pro - oxidant activity [ 3 ] ; as well as ( ii ) pronounced changes in their optical and chemical properties , i . e . , antioxidant activity . As has been demonstrated recently in the course of EPR ( electron paramagnetic resonance ) spin trapping experiments , the formation of H - type aggregates of Crts in aqueous media results in a considerable lowering of their antioxidant potential ( e . g . , lutein ) or even leads to pro - oxidant behavior Nutrients 2014 , 6 477 ( i . e . , zeaxanthin ) [ 136 ] . Nevertheless , also , other Crts , such as astaxanthin , lutein or β - cryptoxanthin , rather than β - carotene , should be considered as potentially helpful agents toward cardiovascular disorders [ 137 , 138 ] . However , still more data need to be collected to fully explain the discrepancies between the observational and interventional data . 6 . 3 . Photosensitivity Disorders Among the physical factors noticeably affecting all kinds of biological molecules is UV radiation . The uncontrolled exposure to its natural or artificial sources may result in a range of photosensitivity disorders associated with epidermal and dermal damage . Hence , a number of degenerative changes in the cells , fibrous tissue and skin blood vessels may occur . Biologically essential UV radiation ranges from 280 up to 400 nm of the electromagnetic spectrum . The short wavelength UV - B radiation ( 280 – 315 nm ) is predominately absorbed by keratinocytes in the epidermis . It may lead to sunburn ( erythema ) , which is the first response of UV - treated skin [ 139 ] . Via direct interactions of this UV radiation with nucleic acids , it is regarded as one of the major causes of photocarcinogenesis . The longer wavelength UV - A radiation ( 315 – 400 nm ) is capable of penetrating deeper parts of dermis . Apart from the undoubtedly positive effects on human health ( e . g . , the induction of vitamin D synthesis ) , it may cause the generation of ROS , which are known to be crucial in the processes of photoageing [ 140 ] . Carotenoids , due to their excellent 1 O 2 quenching , as well as other ROS scavenging properties , have garnered particular attention as protective agents in skin photo - related disorders . It is suggested that Crts ( especially β - carotene and canthaxanthin ) could act as efficient scavengers of excited triplet states of endogenous photosensitizers , such as protoporphyrin , which is accumulated in the blood and skin of patients with inherited erythropoietic protoporphyria [ 141 ] . They were also demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of polymorphous light eruptions [ 142 ] . The effect of Crts on sun erythema formation ( sunburn ) has been investigated intensively over the years [ 143 – 148 ] . In the course of a recent meta - analysis study , it has been clearly demonstrated that β - carotene supplementation does protect against sunburn in a time - dependent manner ( the effected size of the protection was shown to require a minimum of 10 weeks ) [ 149 ] . Human intervention studies delivered comparable results for lycopene [ 150 – 152 ] . More recently , phytoene and phytofluene , two colorless precursors of Crts , were pointed out as potentially beneficial dietary agents . Due to their spectral properties , i . e . , light absorption in the UV - B and UV - A range , they are expected to noticeably contribute to the photoprotective effects of Crts - rich food for skin health [ 148 , 153 ] . The development of skin cancer ( photocarcinogenesis ) is a complex process usually initiated by UV radiation [ 154 ] . The potentially advantageous effect of Crts against photocarcinogenesis remains still ambiguous . Observational studies do not confirm the role of Crts in the reduction of non - melanoma skin cancer risk [ 155 – 157 ] . On the other hand , case control studies indicate a positive correlation between basal cell carcinoma development and lutein intake [ 158 ] . The beneficial role of Crts was also postulated during the process of photoageing , which is accompanied by wrinkling , additional pigmentation , telangiectasia , dryness and skin inelasticity [ 159 ] . Nevertheless , the available experimental data are inconsistent [ 160 ] ; therefore , as in the case of other light - induced skin disorders , further research to confirm the advantageous effect of Crts is required . Nutrients 2014 , 6 478 6 . 4 . Other The ability of Crts to act as protective agents against ROS has also been observed in eye - related disorders . In the eye lens and the macular region of the retina ( yellow spot ) , two oxygen - containing carotenoids , lutein and zeaxanthin , are present in high concentrations . Both of them are regarded as very important components for eye health . It is suggested that their major function is protection against high - energy UV radiation that is focused onto the foveal region . Moreover , they are well - known for excellent ROS scavenging properties [ 77 ] , which are of special significance , also due to the fact that biochemical processes that occur within photoreceptors ( phototransduction and oxidative phosphorylation ) are essential sources of ROS [ 161 ] . As has been reviewed recently [ 162 ] , the data obtained from epidemiological , clinical and interventional studies demonstrate that both Crts are effective agents in reducing the risk of age - related macular degeneration , a major cause of impaired vision and blindness in the elderly , and cataracts . The role of lutein and zeaxanthin as macular pigments and their role in eye health has been summarized in detail by Loskutova et al . [ 163 ] and Abdel - Aal et al . [ 20 ] . The beneficial effects of dietary Crts have been also reported for other processes , e . g . , stimulation of the immune system in inflammatory diseases or human immunodeficiency disease [ 164 ] . 7 . Conclusions Carotenoids , being exceptionally efficient physical and chemical quenchers of 1 O 2 and other ROS , have garnered particular attention as potentially protective agents against ROS - mediated disorders . Up to date , in a number of epidemiological , interventional and clinical studies , a large body of data , mostly from experiments with β - carotene , lycopene , lutein and zeaxanthin , have been collected , generally supporting the observation that the adequate intake of Crt - rich fruits and vegetables or Crt supplements may significantly reduce the risk of some chronic diseases . Thus , the beneficial effects of Crt administration have been confirmed in the case of several types of cancer and cardiovascular and photosensitive disorders , as well as in eye - related diseases . Nevertheless , due to the fact that some of the results remain inconsistent , more data need to be collected before the Crt - ROS - mediated - disorder relationship will be fully recognized .
