Biochem . J . ( 1989 ) 258 , 381 - 387 ( Printed in Great Britain ) Analysis of progress curves by simulations generated by numerical integration Chris T . ZIMMERLE and Carl FRIEDEN * Department of Biological Chemistry , Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , MO , 631 10 , U . S . A . A highly flexible computer program written in FORTRAN is presented which fits computer - generated simulations to experimental progress - curve data by an iterative non - linear weighted least - squares procedure . This fitting procedure allows kinetic rate constants to be determined from the experimental progress curves . Although the numerical integration of the rate equations by a previously described method [ Barshop , Wrenn & Frieden ( 1983 ) Anal . Biochem . 130 , 134 - 145 ] is used here to generate predicted curves , any routine capable of the integration of a set of differential equations can be used . The fitting program described is designed to be widely applicable , easy to learn and convenient to use . The use , behaviour and power of the program is explored by using simulated test data . INTRODUCTION Data associated with monitoring a chemical or enzymatic reaction to completion are often referred to as a ' full time course ' or ' progress curve ' . Progress curves are a potentially powerful tool in the estimation of kinetic parameters and in differentiation between kinetic mechanisms . Despite this potential , the difficulties encountered in model diagnostics and computer implementation of the complex algorithms involved in the determination of rate constants from progress curves have limited its general use . In this paper we present the description of a recently developed computer program named FITSIM that analyses progress - curve data for a wide variety of kinetic mechanisms . This program is designed to be user - friendly and highly flexible in its operation . Although previously reported computer programs have allowed the analysis of full - time - course reactions to specific mechanisms ( i . e . Canela & Franco , 1986 ; Gordon et al . , 1986 ; Cox & Boeker , 1987 ) , FITSIM is designed to allow , at least in principle , the analysis of nearly any user - entered mechanism . Examples of the use of this program are given by Zimmerle et al . ( 1987 ) , Kurz et al . ( 1987 ) , Sekhar & Plapp ( 1988 ) and Lee et al . ( 1988 ) . The flexibility of the system described is due , in part , to the operation ofthe kinetic simulation routines utilized by FITSIM . These kinetic simulation routines are derived from the program KINSIM ( Barshop et al . , 1983 ) , which explicitly establishes the differential equations for a reaction mechanism that are then numerically integrated to yield outputs at given time intervals . This approach eliminates the need for steady - state approximations , overcoming some experimental limitations and errors associated with this approximation ( Farrow & Edelson , 1974 ) . Furthermore , the simulation routines used can , in principle , monitor any physical parameter known to be proportional to the reaction time course ( e . g . fluor - escence , absorbance , activity , radioactivity , etc . ) . FITSIM is written in FORTRAN 77 and is anticipated to be largely machine - independent , highly flexible in its operation and relatively easy to use . In this paper we will present the major options available to the user and show how this program can be used in the analysis of full - time - course reactions . THEORY In general , the utilization of progress curves in kinetic analyses has mostly been limited to relatively simple Michaelis - Menten type kinetics and has involved fitting data to an analytically derived integrated rate equation ( e . g . Kellershohn & Laurent , 1985 ; Cox & Boeker , 1987 ) or directly to the rate equation ( e . g . Canela & Franco , 1986 ; Koerber & Fink , 1987 ) . The program described here fits experimental progress curve data to curves generated by the KINSIM program ( Barshop et al . , 1983 ) . The method of numerical integration used by KINSIM to generate the predicted progress curves utilizes both the Gear ( 1971 ) method and the flux - tolerance method to keep the numerical solution within the bounds set by the user . This approach was described in detail previously ( Barshop et al . 1983 ; Barshop , 1984 ) . The structure of FITSIM is such , however , that any routine capable of generating a simulated progress curve can be used and calls to the KINSIM subroutine could be redirected to any subroutine capable of generating the predicted time course . In FITSIM , each point at a given time in the simulated progress curve is then numerically compared with the corresponding time point in the experimental curve by calculating the summation of the squared differences ( SSQ ) between the two . The overall SSQ value between all the simulations and experimental progress curves is determined by eqn . ( 1 ) , n [ tem SSQ = E , ws E wt ( expt - cal t ) 2 s = l t = l s ( 1 ) Abbreviation used : SSQ , sum of squares . * To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be sent , at the following address : Washington University School of Medicine , Department of Biological Chemistry , Box 8094 , St .

Frieden where n8 is the number of data sets , or reaction time courses , m is the maximum simulation time , whereas expt and cal , are the experimental and calculated points at the reaction time , t , for a given simulation parameter set , s . Unequal variance of the experimental data at time t can be compensated for by the weighting factor w . The term w8 is routinely used to normalize each full time course to a common value . This compensates for differences in the number of data points or overall scale in different progress curves and prevents over - weighting of one reaction progress curve over another . In the present implementation of FITSIM it is assumed that all progress curves are of equal weight . Since the determined SSQ is a measure ofthe goodness - of - fit between the experimental and simulated data , decreases in this value should lead to an overall better fit . The value of the SSQ is decreased by using a non - linear least - squares regression algorithm . Such algorithms can be expressed as : Y = F ( f , / 1 , . . . Ik ; Xl I X2 . . . XXn ) + ( 2 ) where e is the residual error , 8Ji represents all the unknown non - linear parameters and Xi represents the various independent variables of a function , F . It is clear from this equation that an inadequate number of / parameters ( k ) will result in a larger c , whereas if a model perfectly fits the observed data , e is equal to zero . From the initial estimates of the , parameters , corrections are applied which result in a better fit of the observed to the simulated data as defined by a lower value of e until corrections become negligible and no further reduction in the SSQ is possible . PROGRAM OPERATION Scheme 1 shows the relationship between the four major routines composing FITSIM . The arrows in Scheme 1 indicate input or output between the modules . Log file The REGRESS module contains a non - linear regression algorithm which calculates the changes in the kinetic constants believed to result in a better fit between the experimental data and the predicted data generated by the module KINSIM . Although in the present implemen - tation the algorithm is based on one first described by Marquardt ( 1963 ) , others could be incorporated here as well . The module KINSIM contains the kinetic simulator routines and is essentially identical with the program KINSIM , previously described by Barshop et al . ( 1983 ) , running in supervised mode . Use of this module requires prior mechanism entry followed by compilation to set up the differential equations and simulation necessary for the numerical iteration of these equations . Other routines capable of calculating predicted data at a given reaction time may also be inserted at this point , but the use of the KINSIM program as the kinetic simulator enables many of the user - friendly features of the KINSIM program to be implemented in FITSIM . The module AUTOSIM is the communication linkage between the KINSIM and REGRESS modules and is also responsible for data input and output . The module FITDATA compiles the necessary information needed by the AUTOSIM routine into a sequential file read by the main program . The present program is compiled with a VAX FORTRAN 77 compiler under VAX / VMS ver . 4 . 7 . Since only a few VAX - specific RTL routines are used in the program , and these are unnecessary for the basic operation of the program , the program should be portable to other computer systems with a good FORTRAN 77 compiler . Of course system - specific modules such as file in / out routines and plotting routines will probably need to be modified . The time required for program execution depends not only on the complexity of the mechanism , but also on the number of varied parameters , the number of curves , and the number of data points .

SIM Created by file editor on FITDATA program Generated by FITSIM each iteration the minimum number of generated kinetic simulations is equal to ( NV + 1 ) ND where NV is the number of freely varied constants and ND is the number of progress curves . Thus except for relatively simple models , FITSIM usually requires a large amount of computational time . The implementation of FITSIM used here requires approx . 300 kilobytes of memory , depending slightly on the terminal version compiled . In addition there is a separate command program available for VAX / VMS systems which integrates the simula - tion ( KINSIM ) , analysis ( FITSIM ) , and mechanism compiler programs with each other . This command procedure also allows an extensive amount of on - line help to be accessed . A brief description of the files used in the input execution of FITSIM is given in Table 1 . As noted , there is complete compatibility between the files used by the kinetic simulator program , KINSIM , and those used by FITSIM . This facilitates the use of both programs , since fits can easily be transferred between both programs . Entry of a specific mechanism is typed in using conventional chemical format and compiled in the same manner as described previously for KINSIM ( Barshop et al . , 1983 ) . Plots of the final fits obtained by FITSIM can be displayed using KINSIM . Although experimental data must be in a specific format to be able to be read in by the system , conversion into this format is relatively simple and requires only a minimal amount of FORTRAN programming . Any piece of computer - interfaced equipment should be able to generate data in a form usable by FITSIM . METHODS As indicated in Table 1 , before a regression analysis of any progress - curve data can begin , initial values for each of the kinetic constants contained within a given mechanism must be specified . Although it is impossible to give any general guidelines , it is usually not difficult to estimate initial values for the kinetic constants based either on experimental evidence or preliminary simu - lations using KINSIM . The choice of initial values is more important when a large number of kinetic constants are being varied . There are several options available to tailor the output and / or regression analysis to the needs of the user . For Vol . 258 instance , to decrease the number of freely varied rate constants or to maintain a given ratio between rates , ratios between rate constants ( i . e . linked rate constants ) can be defined . For any given group of linked rate constants , only one of the rate constants is allowed to vary , while the value for all other rate constants in the linkage group are calculated according to ratios entered by the user . In addition , different options exist within the program for setting the weights associated with the data in an individual progress curve ( wt in eqn . 1 ) , although usually this parameter is assigned a value of 1 , making all the data points in a given curve equal weight . This appears to be the best option to use for most data sets , and it is desirable to edit data files to eliminate data after the reaction is essentially complete . Executing FITSIM creates output in the form of a sequential disk file named by the user ( Log . LOG of Table 1 ) . This file includes a description ofthe mechanism and initial values for the kinetic constants , the names associated with the data files being fitted , the regression options selected , the kinetic constants varied , and the simulation parameters used . Log . LOG also contains the results of the fitting procedure , i . e . the final SSQ , the weighted mean SSQ , standard deviation of the fit and the estimated kinetic parameters and their associated errors . All of these values are important when comparing the quality of fits achieved by rival kinetic mechanisms . A good model gives meaningful values for the kinetic constants with low standard deviations ( generally less than 50 % o ) , a low value for the SSQ , and a value for the weighted mean SSQ compatible with the experimental variance ( Mannervik , 1982 ) . As with nearly any other non - linear regression procedure , it is always possible that the final fit obtained is not the best one . Since only relatively small changes in the kinetic constants occur after each iteration , it is possible that a much larger change in the kinetic constants at a given point would lead to a much better fit . To prevent this problem , repeat runs of FITSIM should be performed with different initial starting values for the kinetic constants . RESULTS A simple kinetic mechanism , described by Scheme 2 , is used here to demonstrate several features of the program . 383 C . T . Zimmerle and C . Frieden This mechanism is essentially the same as that used previously to fit progress curves associated with a Mg2 - induced conformational change in actin ( Zimmerle et al . , 1987 ) . With this scheme the binding of A induces a conformational change in the protein , P . k + l k + 2 A + P AP AP AP ' kSe k - 2 Scheme 2 . By using Scheme 2 , simulations were generated by KINSIM using different concentrations of A , P and AP ' and using the kinetic parameters 1 m - M ' - s - ' for k + 1 , 1000 s - 1 for k 1 , 0 . 1 s - 1 for k + 2 and 0 . 02 s - ' for k - 2 . Random error was then introduced into these simulated progress curves by the Monte Carlo method to generate pseudo - experimental data . This involved the addition of a random number , derived from a Gaussian error distribution of 60 % , to the simulated progress curves . This pseudo - experimental data was subsequently used to test the operation of the program . Fitting of the data was initiated with initial estimates of 5000 s - 1 for k1 , , 0 . 5 s - 1 for k + 2 and 0 . I s - ' for k2 . The value of k + , was held constant at 1 / LM - ' - s - ' . Table 2 summarizes the final parameter values obtained using simulated experimental data with maximum relative errors of 0 , 20 , 60 and 100 % respectively . Although the final SSQ increased considerably as the amount of random error increased , little difference in the final parameter estimates obtained by FITSIM is found . Thus random error has only a small effect on the accuracy of the final parameter estimates obtained . Fig . 1 shows the simulated experimental data with 60 % relative error along with the predicted progress curve of best fit . In addition , Fig . l ( b ) demonstrates the potential of FITSIM not only to fit experimental progress curves following the concentration of AP ' , but also to fit simultaneously experimental data which follows the concentration of P . Table 3 shows that the accuracy of the final parameter estimates is altered when a 100 underestimation of the concentration of A occurs . This underestimation of the concentration of A results in an overestimation of the affinity of P for A . No increases in the errors associated with the final parameters are obtained ; thus such error , at least in this case , might go undetected . A large increase in the errors associated with the final parameter estimates occurs with either over - parameterization of a model or an insufficient amount of data . Table 3 clearly demon - strates the effect of the latter . The KINSIM subroutine is capable of simulating more than one output at a time . This allows the simultaneous fitting of experimental data obtained by two different methods , i . e . , data which follow the appearance of product can be analysed at the same time as data which follow the disappearance of substrate . This capability is demonstrated in Fig . 1 . To demonstrate the versatility of the program and its ability to analyse complex kinetic schemes , analysis of pseudo - experimental data with 200 % relative error to Scheme 3 was undertaken . Scheme 3 is the mechanism proposed by Frieden & Goddette ( 1983 ) for the poly - merization of actin , where A represents actin , A ' Mg represents Mg2 " - activated actin , ACa represents actin with bound Ca2 " and AMg2 represents actin with two molecules of Mg2 ' bound . KMg1 and KMg2 describe the initial binding to the first and second Mg2 + sites respectively , Kdimer , Ktrimer , and Ktet the formation equilibrium for dimer , trimer and tetramer formation respectively , and k e / k + e the dissociation constant for filament formation . The pseudo - experimental data follows a fluorescence increase upon the formation of dimer and higher - Mr species .

A problem with the analysis of complex mechanisms with a large number of freely varied rate constants is that large errors may be associated with the final determined values . This is to be expected , owing to the more Table 2 .

Example of progress curve analysis using the FITSIM program , Scheme 2 and pseudo - experimental data which follows the concentration of AP ' Kinetic values taken from Table 2 in which there was an initial 60 % relative error . In ( a ) the continuous lines represent the best fits to pseudo - experimental data with [ A ] = 5 mM ( - ) , 500 / tM ( - ) and 50 / M ( - ) in the presence of 10 , uM - protein P . In ( b ) the continuous line represents the best fit through the pseudo - experimental data for the reverse conformational change when [ AP ' ] is 10 / LM . The broken line follows the generation of P by this reaction and demonstrates the potential of FITSIM to follow both product accumulation and substrate depletion in the same analysis . Pseudo - experimental data were generated by randomizing simulated progress curves produced by KINSIM as described in the text . numerous degrees of freedom in the model . Furthermore , reported standard errors cannot be taken too seriously , as they are based on linearizing assumptions and always underestimate the true uncertainty ( Motulsky & Ransnos , 1987 ) . The extent to which a particular error value is underestimated depends upon the particular mechanism , progress - curve data and weighting scheme utilized . The best method to determine the amount of errors associated with a particular analysis is to systematically generate data with a known amount of error and then to analyse this pseudo - experimental data , as was done here . Table 4 demonstrates parameter values are poorly determined when a particular method used in monitoring the reaction is relatively insensitive to changes in these rate constants . This occurs even when a presumably wide range of concentrations are analysed . Thus the kinetic parameters with the largest errors in Table 4 are those which only indirectly alter the increase in fluorescence seen , constants , such as KMg . However , since the ratio of the Mg2 + / Ca2 + - binding affinity at the first site does directly influence the fluorescence increase upon the polymerization of actin , this ratio is nearly constant at 5 . 2 . As shown by analysis C of Table 4 , simply setting the correct value for k + 1 gives a considerably better end result . Therefore , particularly in analyses where a large number of kinetic parameters are varied , care should be exercised in the interpretation of both the final values obtained and their associated errors . DISCUSSION The method described here to fit progress - curve data allows great flexibility and ease of use . Progress - curve simulations generated by using numerical - integration techniques are used to create predicted curves . The kinetic parameters used in creating these predicted curves are then adjusted in an iterative manner by non - linear regression techniques to obtain the best fit between the experimental and predicted curves . Although fits to experimental data have been obtained previously by manually comparing simulated and experimental progress curves ( e . g . Penner & Frieden , 1987 ) , this method was tedious , time - consuming and allowed no parameter errors to be obtained . The program described here , FITSIM , eliminates such limitations while main - taining and expanding upon the strengths of this approach to analysing progress curves . FITSIM can fit experimental progress - curve data to widely different mechanisms and to test the resultant fits by statistical methods . It is quite possible that a given rate constant may yield a wide range of values under certain experimental conditions , especially when dealing with relatively complex mechanisms . As demonstrated by Frieden & Goddette ( 1983 ) , this occurs particularly when an insufficiently wide range of experimental conditions is analysed . Not only can this usually be avoided by selection of a proper range of experimental conditions , but an option in FITSIM has been implemented to check for such possibilities . Furthermore , insufficient data will cause large errors to be associated with the determined experimental rate constants , as shown in Table 3 . Little information is available for the justification of using the Marquardt ( 1963 ) method as the method of choice for non - linear regression analysis . It is possible Vol . 258 C . T .

Historically , the Marquardt ( 1963 ) method has appeared to be well - suited for the type of regression analysis needed by FITSIM . Matyska & Kovar ( 1985 ) reported that this was the best method for direct fitting of the Michaelis - Menten equation , and this method has generally been the one used most in other kinetic - analysis programs ( Zimmerle , 1985 ; Franco et al . , 1986 ; Lutz et al . , 1986 ; Koerber & Fink , 1987 ) . The design of FITSIM , however , is such that implementation of other regression methods should be relatively easy . There is undoubtedly a practical limit to the number of parameters which can be varied before FITSIM cannot effectively solve for kinetic parameters which yield the best fit . The maximum upper limit for the number of varied parameters depends on the number of data files fitted , the quality of the data and the initial starting values . Although in the implementation we use the maximum number of varied parameters is 10 and the maximum number of data files is 8 , these numbers can be increased relatively easily . Generally , in our experience with the program , the number of varied parameters should be equal to , or less than , the number of experimental progress curves entered for correct convergence and well - determined final parameters to be obtained . When the data are insensitive to changes in the kinetic constants being varied , little or no improvement in the SSQ will be obtained and the estimated kinetic parameters will have large errors associated with them . Thus the varied parameters should be tested to insure that the data are sensitive to the kinetic parameters being varied . This test can be easily done through an option available in FITSIM . FITSIM , along with its companion program , KINSIM , provides a powerful , yet relatively easy - to - use , system for the analysis and modelling of chemical kinetics . As with KINSIM , emphasis has been placed to make FITSIM ' user - friendly ' and be able to clearly diagnose a multitude of input and / or output errors which could occur . The program has been designed to allow the user great flexibility in both mechanism entry and in the analysis of experimental data to a given mechanism . Furthermore , at least under VAX / VMS , the final fits of the data to the mechanism can easily be plotted either to a printer or to a terminal screen .
