Recently , increasing attention has been paid to DGK α isozyme as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy . We have previously shown that DGK α is positively regulated by Ca 2 + binding to its N - terminal EF - hand domains ( DGK α - EF ) . However , little progress has been made for the structural biology of mammalian DGKs and the molecular mechanism underlying the Ca 2 + - triggered activation remains unclear . Here we report the ﬁ rst crystal structure of Ca 2 + - bound DGK α - EF and analyze the structural changes upon binding to Ca 2 + . DGK α - EF adopts a canonical EF - hand fold , but unexpectedly , has an additional α - helix ( often called a ligand mimic [ LM ] helix ) , which is packed into the hydrophobic core . Biophysical and bio - chemical analyses reveal that DGK α - EF adopts a protease - susceptible “ open ” conformation without Ca 2 + that tends to form a dimer . Cooperative binding of two Ca 2 + ions dissociates the dimer into a well - folded monomer , which resists to proteolysis . Taken together , our results provide experimental evidence that Ca 2 + binding induces substantial conformational changes in DGK α - EF , which likely regu - lates intra - molecular interactions responsible for the activation of DGK α and suggest a possible role of the LM helix for the Ca 2 + - induced conformational changes .

We here present the ﬁ rst crystal structure of EF - hand domains of diacylgly - cerol kinase α in its Ca 2 + bound form and characterize Ca 2 + - induced conformational changes , which likely regulates intra - molecular interactions . Our study paves the way for future studies to understand the structural basis of DGK isozymes . Keywords : diacylglycerol kinases ; DGK α ; EF - hand domains ; calcium binding ; a ligand mimic helix ; crystal structure ; conformational changes Introduction While existing as a minor lipid component in cell mem - branes , signaling lipids play a key role in a plethora of cellular events , and their levels are dynamically and tightly controlled by lipid - metabolizing enzymes such as phospholipases , lipid phosphatases , and lipid kinases . Diacylglycerol kinase ( DGK ) is one such lipid kinase that catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) - dependent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol ( DG ) to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) . 1 – 3 Both DG and PA serve as sec - ond messengers , and activate and modulate a number of signaling proteins 4 – 7 including ( i ) protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms 5 , 8 , 9 and Ras guanyl nucleotide - releasing protein ( RasGRP ) 10 , 11 by DG , and ( ii ) mammalian tar - get of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) 12 and phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) 13 by PA . Hence , DGK functions as a molecular hub for many signaling events by terminating / attenuating DG signaling and activating PA signaling . 1 , 2 Among 10 mammalian isozymes of DGK ( α , β , γ , δ , η , κ , ε , ζ , ι , and θ ) identi ﬁ ed so far , 1 , 3 DGK α has recently been recognized as a potential target for anti - cancer treatments including cancer immunotherapy . 14 – 18 The expression of DGK α has been found upregulated in various types of cancer cells including melanoma cells ( but not in non - cancerous melanocytes ) , 19 lymphoma , 20 hepatocellular carcinoma , 21 breast cancer cells , 22 and glioblastoma cells 18 where DGK α promotes cancer cell survival , proliferation , migration , and invasion . 23 In T - lymphocytes , on the other hand , DGK α is known as a critical attenuator for cellular immunity . DGK α is highly expressed in T - cells and terminates DG signal - ing critical for RasGRP1 - dependent activation of the Ras – Erk pathway . 24 Furthermore , in vitro and in vivo studies have uncovered that DGK α is responsible for T - cell hyporesponsive state known as the anergy state . 25 , 26 Therefore , as exempli ﬁ ed in our and other studies , a DGK α inhibitor not only has detrimental effects on cancer cells by inducing apoptosis , 16 , 18 but stimulates the production of Interleukin - 2 in Jurkat T cells , 16 which may potentially restore the anti - tumor function of T - cells . This evidence strongly suggests that a DGK α - selective inhibitor can possibly be utilized for cancer immunotherapy . 14 However , little pro - gress has been made in understanding the struc - tural biology of mammalian DGKs . No structures of DGK α catalytic and regulatory domains have been reported , impeding the development and optimiza - tion of effective DGK α inhibitors . DGK α is a Type I DGK isozyme and contains multiple domains including a recoverin homology ( RVH ) domain , a pair of EF - hand domains ( EF ) , two cysteine - rich , zinc ﬁ nger - like regions called C1 domains ( C1 ) , and a carboxyl - terminal catalytic domain ( CD ) [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . 27 This modular structure is believed to be responsible for enzymatic properties and cellular localizations . 1 , 2 Among those modules , the EF - hand domain can bind calcium and has been long known to activate and modulate Ca 2 + signaling events or control Ca 2 + homeostasis . 28 – 30 Accumulat - ing evidence has demonstrated a pivotal role played by the EF - hands of DGK α ( DGK α - EF ) in regulating the enzymatic activity of DGK α . Our previous studies have shown that DGK α puri ﬁ ed from porcine thymus binds calcium with a stoichiometry of 2 moles of Ca 2 + per mole of the enzyme , and that the Ca 2 + binding to DGK α - EF activates the enzyme . 31 – 33 We and others have also revealed that the truncation of RVH and EF - hand domains constitutively activates DGK α , irrespective of whether calcium is present or not . 32 , 34 Furthermore , Ca 2 + binding is critical for DGK α to translocate to the membrane . 31 Merino et al . have shown that deletion of N - terminal domains leads to constitutive localization of the DGK α mutant to the plasma membrane in T - cells . 35 To advance our understanding of the structural basis for the Ca 2 + - dependent activation of DGK α , we here report the ﬁ rst crystal structure of human DGK α - EF in its Ca 2 + bound form and characterize the Ca 2 + binding to DGK α - EF and the conformational changes triggered by Ca 2 + binding . Results Structure determination of DGK α - EF with Ca 2 + DGK α - EF [ aa 107 – 197 of the mature protein ; Figure 1 ( a ) ] with N - terminal His 6 - SUMO tag was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and puri ﬁ ed from soluble cell lysate using Ni - af ﬁ nity chromatography . After cleavage of His 6 - SUMO tag with ubiquitin - like speci ﬁ c protease ( Ulp1 ) , DGK α - EF in a tag - free form could be puri ﬁ ed to homogeneity using Ni - af ﬁ nity chromatography followed by size - exclusion chroma - tography ( SEC ) in the presence of 5 m M CaCl 2 .

DGK α consists of the N - terminal regulatory domains including recoverin homology domain ( RVH ) , a pair of EF - hand motifs ( DGK α - EF ) and cysteine - rich , the protein kinase C conserved Region 1 ( C1 ) domains , and the C - terminal catalytic domain . RVH is related to the amino terminus of the recoverin family of neuronal calcium sensors . 34 Shown below is the sequence of DGK α - EF ( aa 107 – 197 ) . Helices ( α 1 – α 4 ) are marked by blue ( α 1 – α 2 ) , green ( α 3 – α 4 ) , and pink ( α 5 ) . Residues involved in Ca 2 + coordination ( Ca 2 + - binding loop ) are underlined .

ORG Crystal structure of human DGK α EF - hands protein eluted from a SEC column in a volume of 83 mL corresponding to the DGK α - EF monomer ( 11 kDa ) and was used for crystallization . The crystals of DGK α - EF with CaCl 2 belong to space group P3 2 21 . The crystal structure of DGK α - EF was solved by the single - wavelength anomalous dispersion ( SAD ) utilizing ﬁ ve intrinsic sulfur atoms in the native protein and was re ﬁ ned at a 2 . 1 Å with ﬁ nal R work and R free factors of 18 . 5 % and 23 . 8 % , respectively . Data collection and re ﬁ nement statistics are reported in Table I . Electron density map ( 2Fo - Fc maps ) of a representative view of DGK α - EF is shown in Figure S1 . Crystal structure of the Ca 2 + - bound DGK α - EF The structure reveals that DGK α - EF is a canonical dimeric pair of helix - loop - helix EF - hand motifs and binds two Ca 2 + ions [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Notably , the exiting helices ( α 4 and α 5 ) of the second EF - hand motif ( EF2 ) are interrupted by P189 , and consequently , the short α 5 helix lies almost perpendicular to α 4 [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . The α 5 helix consisting of L190 – L191 – V192 – L193 – L194 is hydrophobic in nature and tightly packed into a hydrophobic core composed of L115 from α 1 , I138 , M142 from α 2 , L160 , M163 , I167 from α 3 , and W180 in α 3 [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . In terms of Ca 2 + binding , each Ca 2 + ion in EF1 and EF2 is coordinated by several acidic residues along with other residues and water mole - cule ( D123 , D125 , N127 , I129 , D131 , E134 for EF1 , D168 , D170 , S172 , S174 , and E179 for EF2 ) [ Fig . 1 ( d ) ] , which are aligned well with Ca 2 + - coordinating resi - dues conserved in other EF - hand domains ( denoted as X , Y , Z , – Y , – X , and – Z ) [ Fig . 1 ( e ) ] , 36 indicating that DGK α - EF binds to Ca 2 + via canonical coordi - nating mechanism . The inter - helical angles between the entering and exiting helices are 68 . 75 (cid:1) for EF1 ( between α 1 and α 2 ) and 64 . 4 (cid:1) for EF2 ( between α 3 and α 4 ) , respectively , well within the range for other EF - hand proteins . 28 , 37 Since DGK α - EF is the ﬁ rst 3D structure deter - mined for DGK Type I isozymes , structural alignment was conducted using the Dali server 38 to search structurally similar proteins in the PDB . The search produced several hits with high Z scores ( de ﬁ ned as a strong match ) as shown in Table S1 . The most struc - turally similar structures include a Ca 2 + - dependent protein kinase ( Z score = 9 , PDB ID 3mse ) , calaxin ( Z = 8 . 7 , 5 × 9a ) , 39 calmodulin - like domain protein kinase ( Z = 8 . 6 , 4ysm ) , L - plastin ( Z = 8 . 4 , 5joj ) , 40 and EFhd / Swiprosin ( Z = 8 . 1 , 5j2l ) 41 . Strikingly , an extra helix as observed in EF2 of DGK α - EF ( α 5 ) also pre - sents in a certain number of those structural homo - logs such as calaxin , 39 L - plastin , 40 EFhd / Swiprosin , 41 and mitochondrial Rho ( Miro ) EF - hand and GTPase domains from human 42 and Drosophila . 43 The extra helix has been previously proposed as a ligand mimic ( LM ) helix , since it is structurally reminiscent of sev - eral EF - hand motifs bounds to their ligands . 43 Repre - sentative EF - hand structures with the LM helix are shown in Figure S2 . We next analyzed the surface area of DGK α - EF in its Ca 2 + - bound form for hydrophobicity . Notably , large hydrophobic patches are clustered and exposed to the top side of the protein , as shown in Figure 2 , to which neighboring RVH and C1 domains are likely adjacent . This suggests the possible involvement of clustered hydrophobic inter - domain interactions in the context of the full - length protein . Of note , P189 and L193 in the LM helix , not packed in the hydro - phobic core , are also exposed to form the hydrophobic surface . Table I .

PROTEINSCIENCE | VOL 28 : 694 – 706 697697 Calcium ions cooperatively bind to DGK α - EF We next used isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) to characterize the calcium binding mode and ther - modynamics of DGK α - EF . Ca 2 + binding to wild - type DGK α - EF was found to be an exothermic process [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] with the binding stoichiometry of n = 2 , which is consistent with the crystal structure of Ca 2 + - bound DGK α - EF ( Fig . 1 ) . The binding isotherm can best ﬁ t with a sequential binding model with slightly different dissociation constants ( K d1 = 0 . 3 μ M and K d2 = 2 . 3 μ M ) [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] . Respective thermodynamic parameters are also shown in Table II . The obtained K d values are comparable with the value previously measured with a full - length DGK α puri ﬁ ed from pig thymus ( K d = 0 . 3 μ M ) 31 and slightly lower than those reported in another study in which a refolded and partially puri ﬁ ed DGK α - EF was used ( K d = 9 . 9 μ M ) . 33 Next , we evaluated two site - directed DGK α - EF mutants ( E134Q and E179Q ) where a calcium coordi - nating glutamic acid at the – Z position in EF1 and EF2 [ Fig . 1 ( e ) ] was replaced with a glutamine by site - directed mutagenesis . For mutants , titration of CaCl 2 into E134Q mutant displayed an exothermic binding process with much less heat changes compared with WT [ Fig . 3 ( b ) ] . The binding stoichiometry was 0 . 96 and the binding af ﬁ nity ( K d = 31 . 7 μ M ) is signi ﬁ - cantly weaker than that of WT , indicating that a sin - gle Ca 2 + ion can bind to DGK α - EF , most likely to EF2 . In contrast , no heat changes were observed for E179Q [ Fig . 3 ( c ) ] , indicating that the mutation of E179 in the Ca 2 + - binding loop of EF2 abolishes Ca 2 + binding . Collectively , these results reveal that DGK α - EF binds to two Ca 2 + ions in a cooperative manner and the two binding sites in EF1 and EF2 are asym - metric with EF2 most likely being the ﬁ rst Ca 2 + bind - ing site . As illustrated for other EF - hand Ca 2 + sensor proteins , 36 this cooperative binding mode would allow DGK α - EF to quickly respond to changes in intracellu - lar Ca 2 + concentration , which increases from 100 nM to 10 μ M upon stimulation . Calcium binding induces a conformational change of DGK α - EF We next probed the effect of Ca 2 + binding on confor - mational and / or oligomerization state of DGK α - EF using SEC . Puri ﬁ ed DGK α - EF was extensively dialyzed a buffer containing 3 m M EGTA to chelate - bound calcium ions , and applied to SEC . Interest - ingly , DGK α - EF in its apo - form eluted in a volume corresponding to 23 . 5 kDa , approximately twice the theoretical mass of DGK α - EF monomer ( 10 . 6 kDa ) [ Fig . 4 ( a , b ) ] . Dependence of the elution on protein concentration was also tested , and we found that DGK α - EF still eluted in a dimer volume when a diluted protein sample [ 0 . 07 mg / mL ( 6 . 6 μ M ) ] was applied [ Fig . 4 ( c ) ] . With lower concentrations of CaCl 2 Figure 2 . Structural characterization of the Ca 2 + - bound DGK α - EF . Surface hydrophobicity was mapped using the color _ h . py python script in PyMOL . Hydrophilic residues are in lighter and white color , and hydrophobic residues are labeled and shown in darker and red color . 698698 PROTEINSCIENCE . ORG Crystal structure of human DGK α EF - hands ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 5 μ M ) , the elution volume of DGK α - EF slightly shifted to longer retention times correspond - ing to 21 . 7 kDa and 19 . 6 kDa [ Fig . 4 ( a ) ] , which are still within the range of DGK α - EF dimer . SEC analy - sis with higher CaCl 2 concentrations ( 2 – 50 μ M ) dem - onstrated that DGK α - EF predominantly eluted in a volume corresponding to its monomer ( 11 kDa ) with small population being eluted in its dimer position . With 200 μ M CaCl 2 , the protein predominantly eluted as a monomer . These results suggest that the apo - DGK α - EF forms a dimer and Ca 2 + binding induces a conformational change to dissociate the dimer into a monomer , which are consistent with our ITC analysis showing K d values in the micro - molar range [ Fig . 3 ( a ) and Table II ] . SEC of a full - length DGK α was also per - formed in the presence of CaCl 2 or EGTA [ Fig . 4 ( d ) ] . Notably , full - length DGK ( 85 kDa ) eluted as a mono - mer under both conditions , suggesting that although DGK α - EF also undergoes a conformational change in the context of full - length protein , the dimer formation of DGK α - EF is probably an arti ﬁ cial product due to its isolation from a full - length protein . To test whether DGK α - EF underwent a confor - mational change upon Ca 2 + binding , we performed limited proteolysis experiments ( Fig . 5 ) . SDS - PAGE after trypsin treatment showed that while calcium binding prevented DGK α - EF from proteolysis , DGK α - EF in the absence of Ca 2 + was more susceptible to proteolysis , producing peptide species smaller than a full - length protein [ Fig . 5 ( a ) ] . Subsequent mass spec - trometry analysis revealed that those peptide species were produced by trypsin cleavage within helices α 1 ( at K120 ) , α 2 ( at R144 ) , and α 3 ( at R182 ) [ Fig . 5 ( b , c ) ] . Circular dichroism spectra of DGK α - EF were also measured with and without CaCl 2 . In the absence of CaCl 2 , DGK α - EF exhibited a spectrum characteristic to α - helix containing proteins with helical content being calculated to be 22 . 1 % . As demonstrated by decreased mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm , the α - helical con - tents further increased upon addition of CaCl 2 ( to 31 . 5 % with 100 μ M CaCl 2 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . Taken together , our anal - ysis suggests that DGK α - EF in its apo - state adopts more open conformation accessible to trypsin , which facilitates dimer formation in those isolated EF - hand domains . Upon binding to Ca 2 + , DGK α - EF likely folds into a more compact conformation with increased α - helical contents , which prefers to be a monomer . Discussion Although the biomedical signi ﬁ cance of DGK iso - zymes has been increasingly recognized , 14 – 18 there has been very limited progress in elucidating the structural basis for DGK function . No structure is available for the catalytic domain of mammalian DGK isozymes . As a part of our long - standing goal of the structural determination of DGK α , we here report the ﬁ rst crystal structure of DGK α - EF in the Ca 2 + - bound form ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . The structure of Ca 2 + - bound DGK α - EF displays a pair of helix - loop - helix EF - hand motifs and a canonical Ca 2 + - coordina - tion . Notably , the existing helix of EF2 is separated to form an additional α 5 helix [ Figs . 1 ( c ) and 2 ( a ) ] , which often referred to as a LM helix in other EF - hand domains ( Fig . S2 and Table S1 ) . For Drosophila Miro which contains two EF - hand motifs sandwiched by two GTPase domains , 43 the LM helix and follow - ing linker region are suggested to be responsible for organizing inter - domain arrangement . Thus , it is rea - sonable to postulate that the hydrophobic LM helix found in the holo - form would play a structurally Figure 3 .

Interestingly , the amino acids that form the LM helix in DGK α are fully conserved among other Type I DGK isozymes ( DGK β and DGK γ ) containing EF - hand domains ( Fig . S4 ) . Unexpectedly , DGK α - EF in its apo - form elutes in a volume corresponding to a dimer [ Fig . 4 ( a , b ) ] . Lim - ited proteolysis combined with MALDI - TOF MS anal - ysis also shows that DGK α - EF is more susceptible to trypsin digestion in the absence of CaCl 2 ( Fig . 5 ) . This increased sensitivity to proteolysis in the absence of CaCl 2 has been also observed for a DGK α construct containing RVH and EF - hand domains . 34 Some would argue that DGK α - EF is largely unstructured without CaCl 2 and has a larger hydrodynamic radius , thus eluting much earlier than that with CaCl 2 from SEC . However , unfolding of EF hands in the absence of CaCl 2 is a very rare case for EF - hand motifs and our circular dichroism measurement demonstrates that there are no drastic changes in the secondary struc - ture of DGK α - EF in the presence and the absence of CaCl 2 ( Fig . S3 ) . These results lead us to suggest that the apo - form DGK α - EF adopts a more open conforma - tion with exposed hydrophobic surface , facilitating the dimerization of DGK α - EF . Our previous study using TNS ﬂ uorescence has shown that DGK α - EF is more hydrophobic when Ca 2 + is absent , 33 supporting our proposed explanations . In this regard , we should also note that the dimer formation is highly likely an arti ﬁ - cial outcome due to the isolation of EF hands , since a full - length DGK α exists as a monomer under condi - tions with and without CaCl 2 [ Fig . 4 ( d ) ] . Another nota - ble feature is that , although most of the EF - hand domains adopt a closed conformation when Ca 2 + ion is absent , 28 , 36 , 44 our previous 33 and current studies sug - gest that DGK α - EF adopts a loosened conformations in the absence of Ca 2 + , then converted into a compact conformation upon binding to Ca 2 + . This re ﬂ ects confor - mational diversity of EF - hand superfamily proteins . 28 In this context , the α 5 LM helix [ Fig . 1 ( b , c ) ] , unique to DGK α - EF and others ( Fig . S1 and Table S2 ) , clearly contributes to form a well - packed hydrophobic core of the holo - DGK α - EF and may play a role in the confor - mational changes from the relaxed apo - form to the holo - form . Structural analysis in the absence of Ca 2 + , however , is required to clearly de ﬁ ne roles of the LM - helix . Unfortunately , our attempt to crystallize the apo - form of DGK α - EF has been unsuccessful to date . For many instances , EF - hand domains in multi - domain proteins are involved in domain - domain interactions . 45 , 46 It still remains controversial which domain ( s ) interacts with DGK α - EF . In our previous studies , pull - down assays have revealed that , in the absence of CaCl 2 , GST - fused DGK α - EF interacts with neighboring C1 domains expressed in COS - 7 cells and this intramolecular interaction is signi ﬁ cantly weakened in the presence of CaCl 2 . 47 , 48 On the other hand , Abe et al . have also demonstrated that Ca 2 + - dependent activation of DGK α is disabled by the mutation of D697 in C - terminal CD , suggesting another model in which N - terminal region including EF - hand domains interacts with CD . 49 We have recently discovered that while a full - length DGK α expressed in insect cells remains a soluble monomer in vitro , a protein construct only containing CD ( DGK α - CD ) forms soluble aggregates upon isolation . 50 This indicates that a potential aggregation - prone surface of DGK α - CD is intra - molecularly buried by the N - terminal regulatory domains including RVH , EF - hands , C1 domain . The crystal structure of DGK α - EF presented here reveals that a large hydro - phobic area is clustered nearby N - and C - termini of DGK α - EF when Ca 2 + ions are bound ( Fig . 2 ) , and it is reasonable that the hydrophobic surface medi - ates intramolecular interactions . Future studies will be required to understand how the conforma - tion of DGK α - EF changes in the absence of Ca 2 + , and DGK α - EF is involved in domain – domain com - munications that keeps DGK α in its auto - inhibition state . In summary , we here report the ﬁ rst crystal structure of DGK α - EF in its Ca 2 + - bound form . The structure reveals the characteristic “ LM ” helix that forms a large hydrophobic surface with other residues . We also demonstrate that DGK α - EF adopts a trypsin - susceptible open conformation in the absence of Ca 2 + and suggest that Ca 2 + binding induces substantial conformational changes that possibly involve the hydrophobic packing of the LM helix . These conformational changes likely regulate domain – domain interactions responsible for the enzymatic activation of DGK α . Further biophysical and structural biology approaches , however , are needed to characterize intra - molecular interac - tions and thus to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying Ca 2 + - dependent activation .

ORG Crystal structure of human DGK α EF - hands Materials and Methods Expression and puri ﬁ cation of DGK α - EF and its mutants The gene segment encoding EF - hand domains ( E107 – E197 ) of human DGK α ( DGK α - EF ) ﬂ anked by Nde I and Sal I restriction sites was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR using the full - length cDNA for human DGK α as a template . PCR product was inserted into a pSUMO vector , and the pSUMO - DGK α - EF was used to transform E . coli strain Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) . The protein construct con - tained a cleavable His - SUMO - tag before the DGK α - EF sequence . Bacterial cells were cultured in Terri ﬁ c Broth media at 37 (cid:1) C until OD 600 reached 2 . 0 – 2 . 5 . The expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding 0 . 2 m M isopropyl β - D - thiogalacto - pyranoside , and the bacterial culture was continued at 37 (cid:1) C for 4 h . Bacteria harvested by centrifugation were suspended in a lysis buffer ( 50 m M sodium phosphate , pH 8 . 0 , containing 300 m M NaCl , 10 m M imidazole , and protease inhibitor cocktails ) and lysed by sonication on ice , and a soluble His 6 - SUMO - fused DGK α - EF was puri ﬁ ed using Ni - af ﬁ nity chro - matography on Ni - NTA agarose ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) . Fractions containing His - SUMO - fused DGK α - EF were combined and dialyzed against Figure 4 . Size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) analysis of DGK α - EF with increasing concentrations of CaCl 2 . ( a ) SEC elution pro ﬁ le of DGK α - EF from a Superdex 75 ( 16 / 60 ) column . The column was equilibrated with 20 m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl , 3 m M EGTA for the sample without CaCl 2 . For each SEC experiment with CaCl 2 , the column was equilibrated with a buffer 1 m M EGTA with increasing concentrations of CaCl 2 . Free Ca 2 + concentration ( 0 . 2 – 200 μ M ) was calculated and adjusted from total CaCl 2 concentrations in the presence of 1 m M EGTA using the Maxchelator program ( http : / / maxchelator . stanford . edu / ) . DGK α - EF sample ( 0 . 4 mg / mL [ 37 . 7 μ M ] × 1 . 5 mL ) was also incubated with respective EGTA / CaCl 2 concentrations before chromatography . ( b ) Effective molecular weight of DGK α - EF as a function of Ca 2 + estimated the elution volume from the column calibrated with the standard proteins ( aldolase ( 158 kDa ) , BSA ( 67 kDa ) , ovalbumin ( 44 kDa ) , carbonic anhydrase ( 29 kDa ) , RNase A ( 13 . 7 kDa ) , and aporotinin ( 6 . 5 kDa ) ) . ( c ) Protein concentration dependence of DGK α - EF elution pro ﬁ le in the absence of CaCl 2 . Concentration and volume of input samples were 0 . 4 mg / mL ( 37 . 7 μ M ) × 1 . 5 mL and 0 . 07 mg / mL ( 6 . 6 μ M ) × 1 . 5 mL , respectively . ( d ) Elution pro ﬁ le of a full - length DGK α . Full - length DGK α sample was prepared following our recently published procedure using the baculovirus - insect cell expression system . 50 After Ni 2 + - af ﬁ nity chromatography , SEC experiments were performed using a Superdex 200 16 / 60 column equilibrated with a buffer ( 20 m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 M NaCl , 3 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 m M DTT , 5 % glycerol ) containing 3 m M CaCl 2 or 5 m M EGTA . Gel - ﬁ ltration standards ( Bio - Rad ) were used to determine the molecular mass of DGK α . Takahashi et al . PROTEINSCIENCE | VOL 28 : 694 – 706 701701 20 m M sodium phosphate , pH 8 . 0 , 300 m M imidaz - ole . For cleavage of the N - terminal His - SUMO tag , 0 . 5 μ g of ubiquitin - like speci ﬁ c protease ( Ulp1 ) per milligram of the protein was added , and the cleav - age reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 30 (cid:1) C . The reaction mixture was applied onto a Ni - NTA column , and the ﬂ ow - through and wash fractions containing the tag - free DGK α - EF was then applied to size - exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , UK ) equilibrated with 20 m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 50 m M NaCl . The purity of DGK α - EF was con ﬁ rmed by SDS - PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( CBB ) staining . Typical yield of the puri ﬁ ed protein was ~ 4 mg of pro - tein per liter of cell culture . Protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm using an extinction coef ﬁ cient of 15 , 470 M − 1 cm − 1 or E 0 . 1 % ( 1 mg / mL ) of 1 . 459 at 280 nm . DGK α - EF containing E134Q , E179Q , and E134Q / E179Q mutations were prepared by site - directed mutagenesis using KOD - plus polymerase ( Toyobo , Osaka , Japan ) and Dpn I ( Takara , Shiga , Japan ) . The mutations were con ﬁ rmed by DNA sequencing . Expres - sion and puri ﬁ cation of the DGK α - EF mutants were carried out by the same procedure as that used for wild - type protein . Expression and puri ﬁ cation of a full length DGK α The production of a recombinant full - length DGK α was conducted by following our recently established procedure . 50 Brie ﬂ y , full length form of DGK α with N - terminal His 6 - tag was heterologously expressed in Sf9 insect cells using baculovirus expression vector system and puri ﬁ ed using a Ni - NTA column chroma - tography ( QIAGEN ) . The eluted protein samples were applied to size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 16 / 60 equilibrated with 20 m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 200 m M NaCl , 3 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 m M dithiothreitol , 5 % glycerol with 3 m M CaCl 2 or 5 m M EGTA ( GE Healthcare ) . Protein crystallization Crystals of the calcium - bound DGK α - EF were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 23 (cid:1) C by mixing the protein solution ( 9 . 6 mg / mL ) dissolved in 20 m M HEPES ( Dojindo , Kumamoto , Japan ) , pH 7 . 4 , 50 m M NaCl , 3 m M CaCl 2 with an equal vol - ume of the reservoir solution containing 0 . 1 M HEPES , pH 7 . 0 , 1 . 0 M succinic acid , and 1 % ( w / v ) PEG monomethyl ether 2000 ( # 34 of Index Crystalli - zation Screens , Hampton Research , Aliso Viejo , CA , USA ) . Crystals grew within a few days and were Figure 5 . Apo - form DGK α - EF adopts a protease - susceptible conformation . ( a ) SDS - PAGE analysis of trypsin - limited proteolysis experiment in the presence of CaCl 2 or EGTA . The digestion reaction was performed at room temperature and quenched at each time point ( 15 , 30 , 60 , and 90 min ) , as shown above the gel , by adding SDS - PAGE loading buffer containing 10 m M PMSF . ( b ) MALDI - TOF MS spectra were acquired on tryptic digests of DGK α - EF in the presence of CaCl 2 or EGTA . Peptide fragments with a mass of 9150 . 4 , 8698 . 4 , 7250 . 5 , and 5892 . 0 were only detected in the sample from the DGK α - EF in its apo - state . ( c ) Arginine and lysine residues at which trypsin cleavage occurred in the apo - form of DGK α - EF were shown as green sticks and mapped on the holo - form structure . Full - length gel is presented in Fig . S5 . 702702 PROTEINSCIENCE . ORG Crystal structure of human DGK α EF - hands cryo - protected by soaking the crystals in a cryo - protectant solution containing 0 . 1 M HEPES , pH 7 . 0 , 1 . 0 M succinic acid ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) , 2 % PEG monomethyl ether 2000 ( Hampton Research ) , and 10 % glycerol ( Wako ) . Crystals were then harvested and ﬂ ash - cooled in liquid nitrogen . Structure determination and characterization Native and single - wavelength anomalous diffraction ( SAD ) data sets were collected from a single crystal at a cryogenic temperature ( 100 K ) on a beam - line BL1A at the Photon Factory ( Tsukuba , Japan ) . The collected data were processed using XDS software 51 and were scaled and merged using XSCALE program . 51 The structure of DGK α - EF was solved by sulfur - SAD phasing method utilizing ﬁ ve intrinsic sulfur atoms in the native protein using AutoSol program . 52 From the experimentally phased maps , the initial structural model was built using AutoBuild program . 53 The struc - tural model was then rebuilt using COOT software , 54 and iteratively re ﬁ ned using PHENIX . re ﬁ ne program . 55 The model was validated using the PROCHECK 56 and RAMPAGE programs . 57 Ramachandran statistics shows that 97 . 6 % of residues are in favored regions , 2 . 4 % in allowed regions , and 0 % are outliers . The crystallo - graphic and re ﬁ nement statistics are summarized in Table I . All structural ﬁ gures were prepared with the program PyMOL ( Schrödinger , LLC , New York , NY , USA ) . Surface hydrophobicity is visualized based on a normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale 58 using Col - or _ h script in PyMOL ( https : / / pymolwiki . org / index . php / Color _ h ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry Calcium binding titrations to DGK α - EF were per - formed with a MicroCal ITC200 ( Malvern Instru - ments ) . DGK α - EF was extensively dialyzed against 20 m M HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 50 m M NaCl , 5 m M EDTA ( 2 L each time for 12 h and two times ) to remove calcium ions bound to the protein during the expression and puri ﬁ cation steps , then further dia - lyzed into 20 m M HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 50 m M NaCl ( 2 L each time for 12 h and four times ) to remove EDTA from the sample . CaCl 2 was directly dissolved in the buffer used for the dialysis . The pro - tein sample was concentrated to 50 μ M using an Ami - con Ultra - 15 centrifugal ﬁ lter ( EMD Millipore , Burlington , MA , USA ) . All solutions were ﬁ ltered through a 0 . 22 μ m membrane ﬁ lter and degassed for 20 min under vacuum . Titrations of DGK α - EF ( 300 μ L ) with 1 m M CaCl 2 were conducted at 25 (cid:1) C . A total of 20 injections were made . The volume of the ﬁ rst injec - tion was 0 . 4 μ L and that of the following 19 injections were 2 μ L . Time interval of 150 sec was used between the injections . Data were ﬁ t to an N - identical binding sites model or sequential binding sites model with Ori - gin 7 ( OriginLab , Northampton , MA , USA ) . Gel ﬁ ltration chromatography Gel ﬁ ltration chromatography was performed on a Superdex 75 16 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) using a Bio - Logic Duo - Flow FPLC system ( BioRad , Hercules , CA , USA ) at 4 (cid:1) C to investigate conformational changes and / or oligomerization state of DGK α - EF in response to Ca 2 + binding . The column was equilibrated with 20 m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl , 1 m M EGTA with increas - ing concentrations of CaCl 2 , and ran at a ﬂ ow rate of 1 mL / min . Free Ca 2 + concentration ( 0 . 2 – 200 μ M ) was calculated from total CaCl 2 concentrations in the pres - ence of 1 m M EGTA using the Maxchelator program ( http : / / maxchelator . stanford . edu / ) . Gel - ﬁ ltration standard ( BioRad ) containing aldolase ( 158 kDa ) , BSA ( 67 kDa ) , ovalbumin ( 44 kDa ) , carbonic anhydrase ( 29 kDa ) , RNase A ( 13 . 7 kDa ) , and aporotinin ( 6 . 5 kDa ) were used as standard proteins to estimate the R s value of DGK α - EF as a function of Ca 2 + concentration . Circular dichroism spectroscopy Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at ambient conditions between 190 and 250 nm on a Jasco J - 805 spectrometer ( Jasco Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) using a cell with a path length of 0 . 2 mm , 20 nm / min scan speed , and a bandwidth of 1 nm . DGK α - EF was pre - pared at 0 . 2 mg / mL ( 18 . 9 μ M ) in 20 m M Tris – HCl buffer , pH 7 . 5 , with various concentrations of CaCl 2 ranging from 0 to 100 μ M . Ten spectra were averaged and a spectrum obtained for the buffer was subtracted . Limited trypsin proteolysis DGK α - EF was prepared at a protein concentration of 0 . 6 mg / mL ( 56 . 6 μ M ) in 20 m M Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl . To the protein solution , CaCl 2 or EGTA was added at a ﬁ nal concentration of 5 m M . Sequenc - ing grade trypsin ( sequencing grade , Promega , Madi - son , WI , USA ) was added to 20 μ L of DGK α - EF solution at 1 : 100 ratio of the trypsin to DGK α - EF . For electrophoresis , reactions were stopped at each time point ( 15 , 30 , 60 , and 90 min ) by adding SDS - PAGE loading buffer containing PMSF ( a ﬁ nal PMSF concen - tration of 10 m M ) followed by the incubation at 95 (cid:1) C for 10 min , and the reaction products were subjected to Tricine SDS - PAGE analysis with CBB staining . For MALDI - TOF MS ( matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization - time of ﬂ ight mass spectrometry ) analysis , 20 μ L of reaction mixture was mixed with 8 . 5 μ L of 10 % tri ﬂ uoroacetic acid ( TFA ) to quench the reaction . MALDI - TOF MS analysis MALDI - TOF MS experiments were performed on a Bruker auto ﬂ ex speed mass spectrometer ( Bruker Daltonics , Bremen , Germany ) equipped with a Lift mode for MS / MS analysis . The trypsin - treated sam - ples were desalted using C - tip ( Nikkyo Technos Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) and eluted with 80 % acetonitrile Takahashi et al . PROTEINSCIENCE | VOL 28 : 694 – 706 703703 ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) and 0 . 5 % formic acid ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) . Desalted sample ( 2 μ L ) was mixed with 1 : 1 ( v / v ) with 2 , 5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( DHB , Bruker Daltonics , Bremen , Germany ) , spotted onto a plate ( MTP 384 ground steel target plate , Bruker Daltonics ) for MALDI - TOF MS , and analyzed using a linear mode . All samples were analyzed under identi - cal instrumental parameters and the instrument was externally calibrated with a set of standard proteins ( Protein Mix 1 , Bruker ) . Masses of the trypsin - digested DGK α - EF were calculated and compared with those of observed MS peaks to identify the posi - tion of trypsin cleavage .
