Here we shortly summarize the different modes of cell travelling and review in vitro methods , which can be used to evaluate migration and invasion . We provide a concise summary of established migration / invasion assays described in the literature , list advantages , limitations and drawbacks , give a tabular overview for convenience and depict the basic principles of the assays graphically . In many cases particular research problems and speciﬁc cell types do not leave a choice for a broad variety of usable assays . However , for most standard applications using adherent cells , based on our experience we suggest to use exclusion zone assays to evaluate migration / invasion . We substantiate our choice by demonstrating that the advantages outbalance the drawbacks e . g . the simple setup , the easy readout , the kinetic analysis , the evaluation of cell morphology and the feasibility to perform the assay with standard laboratory equipment . Finally , innovative 3D migration and invasion models including heterotypic cell interactions are discussed . These methods recapitulate the in vivo situation most closely . Results obtained with these assays have already shed new light on cancer cell spreading and potentially will uncover unknown mechanisms . (cid:2) 2012 Elsevier B . V . All rights reserved .

Introduction Normal processes of cell migration / invasion include gastrula - tion [ 1 ] embryonic morphogenesis , branching morphogenesis ( e . g . breast ducts ) , development of the nervous system [ 2 ] , vascular sprouting [ 3 ] , placental development , wound healing or immune - cell trafﬁcking [ 4 ] . There are also pathological situations in which deregulated cell movement is highly signiﬁcative . Tumor cell migration and invasion is for example clinically most relevant . Cancer is the second leading cause of death and accounted for 7 . 6 million deaths worldwide by 2008 [ 5 ] . Metastasis represents the major problem in the treatment of cancer , is indicative for poor prognosis and has dramatic effects on the survival of patients . Several models of tumor invasion and metastasis have been proposed . These are for example based on multi - step progression [ 6 ] , ‘‘intrinsic’’ metastasis [ 7 ] or metastatic dissemination [ 8 ] although no clear mechanisms were deﬁned . Metastasis involves multiple processes such as inﬁltrative growth through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , cell migration through blood or lymph vessels and rise of distant colonies [ 9 ] . It is strictly associated with tissue invasion of the primary tumor . Matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) have been identiﬁed to break down the ECM . Conse - quently , small molecular weight compounds , which block MMP function , have been developed . Unfortunately , these therapy approaches failed in clinical trials . Since then novel insight into the mechanisms of cancer cell spreading has been gained , showing that tumor cells could escape the MMP inhibition by using protease independent mechanisms to travel through the ECM [ 10 , 11 ] . Hence , therapeutically targeting proteases in combination with additional features of tumor cell invasion and migration remain potent concepts for anti - cancer strategies . Therefore , it is of great interest and of potential therapeutic importance to understand the basic principles and molecular pathways , which are altered in cancer cells to drive the ﬁrst step of metastatic dissemination . 1 . 1 . Deﬁnition of migration and invasion Migration is often used as umbrella term in biology to describe any directed cell movement within the body . The ability to migrate allows cells to change their position within tissues or between different organs . In pathology , invasion of carcinomas is deﬁned as the penetration of tissue barriers , such as passing the basement membrane and inﬁltration ( intrusion ) into the underlying interstitial tissues by malignant tumor cells . Intestinal cancers for example are classiﬁed as invasive , when the tumor mass has crossed the basal membrane and entered the submucosal muscle layer . Deﬁning invasiveness in non - epithelial cancers is more difﬁcult , since there is no clear - cut separation of for example mesenchymal cells by a basement membrane . An explicit discrimination of migration from invasion is not made in many ﬁelds of biology dealing with the in vivo description of directed cell movement . Migration and invasion are clearly separated terms in experimental cell biology . Migration is deﬁned as the directed movement of cells on a substrate such as basal membranes , ECM ﬁbers or plastic plates . Therefore , migration is occurring on 2D surfaces without any obstructive ﬁber network ( an example for a collagen I network is shown in Fig . 1A ) . Invasion is deﬁned as cell movement through a 3D matrix , which is accompanied by a restructuring of the 3D environment . In order to travel through the matrix , a cell must modify its shape and interact with the ECM , which on the one hand provides the cell attachment substrate , on the other hand represents a barrier toward the moving cell body ( Fig . 1B ) . Invasion requires adhesion , proteolysis of extracellular - matrix components and migration [ 12 ] , therefore invading cells remodel the ECM ( Fig . 1C ) . However , passenger leukocytes can migrate through 3D tissues and do not require proteolytic action and tissue remodeling [ 13 ] . Thus , the term ‘‘invasion’’ solely describes the restructuring or destructive movement of cells through a 3D barrier , whereas ‘‘3D migration’’ is used herein to describe non - destructive , non - proteolytic movement in 3D tissues or matrices . Despite the difﬁculties in deﬁning different modes of migration it is a fact that the ability to migrate is a prerequisite to invade ; a cell cannot invade without migration but can move without invasion . In analogy , migration can be seen as walking on a pave , while invasion would correspond to moving through a thorn hedge ( requiring all the tools needed to bushwhack including the ability to walk ) . 1 . 2 . Different modes of cell motility The basic features occurring in a migrating cell have already been clariﬁed . These cells display directional polarity , with a leading edge at the front and a lagging edge at the back of the cell body [ 14 ] . Common to all migration modes is the actomyosin cytoskeleton - mediated change of the cell body shape [ 15 ] . However , external clues such as the physical and molecular characteristics of the environment and intrinsic cellular determi - nants inﬂuence the mode of migration . The two main types are collective migration of multicellular compartments and single cell movement [ 12 ] . The migration of single cells can be subdivided into amoeboid - and mesenchymal types of movement . Amoeboid movement is characterized by cells moving as rounded , ellipsoid bodies without the involvement of focal adhesions and cell attachment but with the aid of propulsing blebs . This is called blebby amoeboid migration [ 13 , 16 , 17 ] and is used for example by embryonic cells , leukocytes migrating through the ECM ( 3D migration ) or by certain cancer cells . The second form of amoeboid migration is characterized by outgrowth of actin - rich ﬁlopodia and weak substrate interaction [ 18 , 19 ] for example in moving neutrophils and dendritic cells or tumor cells [ 20 ] . N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 11 Mesenchymal migration involves strong focal attachment to the extracellular matrix , cytoskeletal contractility and elongated spindle - like cell bodies [ 21 ] . Fibroblasts , sarcoma cells and highly dedifferentiated tumor cells , which have undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) [ 22 ] , use this mode of motility . EMT has not only been proposed to play a key role in the acquisition of a migratory or invasive phenotype of many carcinoma cells , but is also discussed to increase the proportion of cancer stem cells [ 23 , 24 ] . Epithelial cells could therefore dedifferentiate via EMT to cancer stem cells . This might have important clinical consequences for the curative treatment of cancers as the increased plasticity within tumors will require a combination of cancer stem cell and non - cancer stem cell targeting [ 25 ] . Collective migration is characterized by the movement of a cellular cohort through the ECM with the preservation of functional cell – cell junctions . This type of group movement of cells , which are physically attached to each other , occurs either on 2D surfaces , when epithelial sheets travel collectively across basal membranes ( wound healing [ 26 , 27 ] ) . Alternatively , collective migration happens in 3D as branches ( mammary gland [ 28 ] ) , tubes ( vascular sprouting [ 29 ] ) , strands or clusters ( lateral line migration in ﬁsh [ 30 ] ) or cancer cell invasion [ 31 , 32 ] ) . Here , leading cells predominantly travel invasively and the following cells move on pre - paved routes through the ECM . 1 . 3 . Importance of migration / invasion in cancer Metastasis is by far the main cause of cancer lethality ; 90 % of deaths from solid tumors can be ascribed to metastatic dissemi - nation . It is obvious that there is need for novel therapeutic strategies in the clinic to avoid metastatic spreading . New anti - metastatic drugs can only be developed upon knowledge of the basic principles of metastasis . To date the major challenge to clinically monitor inhibition of migration , invasion and metastasis is far from being solved . As metastasis is a multistage process and takes place over months if not years , a clear - cut clinical readout is extremely difﬁcult to obtain and will represent a major challenge for clinically testing anti - metastatic drugs . As already described above , metastasis involves multiple processes ; however , it is strictly connected to initial tissue invasion at the primary tumor site . Therefore , it is essential to know , how cancer cells acquire an invasive phenotype and to understand the respective molecular mechanisms . Functional interferences with different modes of invasion are necessary to counteract the different strategies cancer cells have evolved to move through tissues and organs . These interfering treatment strategies need to be established , which can either be achieved by the use of in vivo and / or in vitro models . Here we will focus on in vitro assays that measure the migratory potential and / or the invasive property of cells and give an overview of commonly used experimental setups . The main advantages of in vitro assays are their relatively easy handling and high reproducibility . Moreover , they often allow the examination and phenotypic analysis during the assay . Furthermore , in vitro assays are suitable for high throughput drug testing ( high throughput screening , HTS ) and are less expensive than in vivo assays . In addition , animal experiments raise ethical concerns , which can be reduced by the use of in vitro models . A summary of the features of these assays is given in Tables 1 and 2 . In vivo migration / invasion assays will not be summarized at this point as these assays were excellently reviewed recently [ 33 ] . However , it should be noted that so far none of the described assays could fairly recapitulate all essential steps in metastasis , but only address parts of it . It seems that a comprehensive in vitro metastasis assay is far from being technically achievable in the near future . 2 . Migration assays 2 . 1 . Transwell migration assay ( Boyden chamber assay ) The transwell assay was originally introduced by Boyden ( and is therefore often called Boyden chamber assay ) to analyze the chemotactic responses of leukocytes [ 34 ] . Improved , simpliﬁed and disposable versions of the original chambers were developed . The principle of this assay is based on two medium containing chambers separated by a porous membrane through which cells transmigrate ( Fig . 2A ) . The size of the cells to be analyzed , determines the required pore size of the membranes . It is essential to choose a pore diameter , which allows an active transmigration i . e . being smaller than the cell diameter to avoid unspeciﬁc dropping of the cells . Membranes are available with pore diameters between 3 and 12 m m . Generally , cells are seeded in medium in the upper part and can migrate in vertical direction through the pores of the membrane into the lower compartment , in which medium containing an attractant or simply higher serum content is present . Of note , a major determinant is the phase of horizontal migration of the cells until a pore is being actually reached . There are two possibilities to detect and quantify the migrated cells : ﬁrst , the cells that passed the membrane can be ﬁxed on the membrane , stained and quantiﬁed . It is important to individually determine the proper incubation time , until the motile cells appear at the other side of the ﬁlter , since it signiﬁcantly varies between different cell types . Thereafter , the membrane is ﬁxed and non - migrated cells remaining on the topside of the ﬁlter are removed with a cotton swab . The migrated cells are stained with cytological dyes ( such as hematoxylin , toluidin blue or crystal Fig . 1 . Invasion . ( A ) Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) illustrates the structure of collagen I ﬁbers assembled in vitro . This picture exempliﬁes that the dense ECM structure represents an appreciable barrier for a moving cell . Scale bar 5 m m . ( B ) SEM of a mesenchymal cell ( pseudocolored in blue ) invading through a collagen I ( white ﬁbers ) matrix by ﬁbroblast like movement .

Collagen ﬁbers are stained in blue whereas the cell body is reddish - brown . Scale bar 5 m m . N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 12 violet ) , and the number of cells that have migrated is determined . For the second method , the migrated cells are stained ﬂuorescent - ly , removed from the membrane by dissociation ( using cell dissociation agents such as trypsin ) and quantiﬁed using a ﬂuorescent reader . Alternatively , dark colored porous membranes are available , which block light transmission ( FluoroBlok , Becton Dickinson ) from unmigrated cells . The detection of the migrated labeled cells is therefore simpliﬁed and there is no need to remove the remaining cells from the top - side of the membrane . The advantages are the availability of different cell culture inserts and sizes , the relative easiness of the experimental setup and a short lasting medium / cytokine / chemokine gradient between the upper and lower culture medium reservoir . This assay is most frequently used to assess cell migration . Except the cell culture inserts no special equipment is needed . The disadvantages are that it is an endpoint assay ; the optimal time of analysis has to be determined individually for each cell type tested . If histological cell staining procedures are used there are several precautions to make : non - invaded cells , which stayed on the upper side of the transwell insert , have to be removed prior to staining of the invasive cells at the bottom of the membrane . This is commonly done by getting rid of the cells with a cotton swab , which often turns out difﬁcult , non - quantitative and of variable success . We strongly recommend using ﬂuorescent dyes , lysing the cells and quantifying them in a plate reader or to rely on the light blocking membranes and quantify migrated cells without lysis . The transwell migration assay is suitable for many different cell types including epithelial [ 35 ] , mesenchymal [ 36 ] and brain [ 37 ] cancer cell lines as well as many primary cells from all three germ layers . Conventional cell culture inserts or whole transwell migration kits are commercially Fig . 2 . Schemes of commonly used migration assays . An overview of the technical setup is schematically drawn for each assay and a close - up view is given right to it ( inside the big circles ) . Arrows indicate the direction of cell movement . Hatched areas symbolize ECM . ( A ) Transwell migration assay ( Boyden chamber assay ) . Migration of a cell through a pore in the membrane is depicted . ( B ) Wound healing assay . Scratching off cells from a dense monolayer produces a cell free area . This is often performed with a vertically held pipette tip . The close up view depicts that cells can be seeded on plastic or glass surfaces or on ECM coated surfaces ( hatched areas ) . ( C ) Cell exclusion zone assay ( Platypus migration assay ) . The cell free area is produced by cell exclusion upon seeding by using silicone stoppers , which are removed before starting the experiment . ( D ) Fence assay . Cells are seeded inside a ring - shaped plastic device , which is placed on a cell culture dish . After cell attachment the ring is removed and the cells migrate from the circular area to the non - covered surrounding . Migration is measured as the increase of the area covered by moving cells . ( E ) Microcarrier bead assay . Microcarrier beads are coated with cells to conﬂuence and subsequently the cell - coated beads are placed onto cell culture dishes and incubated . Cells from the microbead attach to the plate surface and perform radial movement , the area of which can be measured . ( F ) Spheroid migration assay . Multicellular spheroids of a certain cell type are produced and put onto conventional tissue culture dishes . The spheroids attach to the surface and cells start moving concentrically outward . The increase in the spreading area can be measured over time . ( G ) Horizontal capillary assay ( Dunn chamber , Zigmond chamber ) . The cells migrate along a stable gradient of a chemoattractant within a thin bridging capillary . None or special surface coating can be used ( hatched areas , as in B and C ) . ( H ) Capillary tube migration assay . In small capillaries , leukocytes migrate out of the ‘‘buffy coat area’’ into serum . The migration capacity of the cells can be directly measured by determining the position of the migration front in correlation to the starting line . ( I ) Leukocyte migration agarose technique assay . Holes of a deﬁned diameter and distance are punched out of agarose gels ; in one of these holes leukocytes are seeded , which migrate underneath the agarose layer toward a medium reservoir containing a chemoattractant ( or repellent ) , whereas migration toward medium alone serves as control . The area of migration ( dotted line ) is visible and the difference in migration distance is determined . ( J ) Single cell motility assay . Normal tissue culture plates are preincubated with colloidal gold particles and thereafter cells are seeded at low density above . On their way across the plate , the cells clear the gold particles on their routes leaving bright tracks behind , which can be measured . N .

N . K r a m e r e t a l . / M u t a t i o n R e s e a r c h 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 14 available from many providers ( e . g . Life Technologies , Becton Dickinson , Merck Millipore and many others ) . Multiwell transwell assays for high throughput screening of migration were developed in a 96 - well format ( e . g . the disposable ChemoTx system from Neuro Probe Inc . , Gaithersburg , USA ; www . neuroprobe . com ) . 2 . 2 . In vitro wound - healing assay ( scratch assay ) This popular , technically non - demanding and cheap assay can be used to study migration of cells on 2D surfaces . A conﬂuent plate of any type of attached cells is ‘‘wounded’’ by scraping off an area of cells , which is most easily done using a plastic pipette tip ( Fig . 2B ) [ 38 , 39 ] . Cell migration can subsequently be monitored microscopically , as cells travel from the intact zones into the scratched region . Cell movement can be calculated by measuring the decrease of the uncovered region at different time points until the ‘‘wound’’ is closed . Coating of the plates with e . g . collagen I , collagen IV , ﬁbronectin , or basal membrane extract ( BME , often also called Matrigel ) prior to cell seeding offers the possibility to study migration on different substrates . A long term wound - healing assay ( > 24 h ) cannot distinguish cell proliferation and changes in cell survival from cell motility [ 40 ] . Cells can either migrate as single cells , as loosely connected population ( mesen - chymal cells ) or collectively as sheets of cells ( epithelial cells ) . A wide variety of cells have been analyzed for migration with this assay e . g . epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cells [ 41 ] , kerati - nocytes [ 42 ] , normal epithelial cells [ 43 ] , endothelial cells [ 44 ] and ﬁbroblasts [ 45 , 46 ] . The advantages of the assay are its simple and rapid setup , easy readout and analysis and of course its cheapness . One drawback of the assay is that the scratch is often unevenly thick . The migration speed of cells just prior to wound closure is often increased ; therefore variations in gap width prior to the migration start of the cells are critical . In addition , some cells keep attached to the border of the scratch after wounding . These cells often reattach to the plate and move into the wounded area , which leads to adulterated results . Third , the plastic surface or the ECM substrate is scraped off in an uncontrolled manner [ 47 ] and artifacts might be induced by mechanical cell damage . To circumvent these problems new techniques have been developed to ensure invariable wound sizes with deﬁned edges . One way to generate wound areas of deﬁned size without signiﬁcant variation is electric cell – substrate impedance sensing ( ECIS ) [ 48 , 49 ] as for example provided by Applied BioPhysics ( New York , USA ; www . biophysics . com ) . Instead of mechanically disrupting the cell layer and following the migration microscopically , electric signals are employed to both , wound the cell monolayer and to monitor the re - population of the cell - free area . Electrical wounding is applied to cells in contact with a small ECIS electrode by a pulse of high current , which leads to cell death . Thus a well - deﬁned 250 m m wound is created . The insulating property of living cells is lost in the treated region and the impedance drops . Thereafter , the migration of cells into the cleared area is measured by increased impedance in real time as the wound proceeds to close [ 50 ] . The advantage of the system is that it can be automated and is feasible for medium to high throughput assays . Alterna - tively , wounding can be achieved by laser ablation of the cells in a deﬁned area [ 51 ] . One drawback of both systems might be cell remnants , which are left after the electric ablation in the wounding area [ 52 ] and possibly inﬂuence wound closure . To our knowledge simple scratch assays , which are based on mechanical wounding by hand , are not commercially offered . Electric cell ablation assays can be bought from Applied Biophysics as described in more detail above . Of note , a free software tool called ‘‘TScratch’’ ( www . chaton . ethz . ch / software ) is available , which allows simple automated image analysis of any wound healing and cell exclusion zone assay [ 53 ] . 2 . 3 . Cell exclusion zone assay A possibility to circumvent the above described cell remnants is to create cell exclusion zones at the time of cell seeding with e . g . microstencils [ 52 ] or by applying an electrical fence ( Applied BioPhysics , New York , USA ; www . biophysics . com ) . Platypus Technologies Inc . ( Madison , USA ; www . platypustech . com ) designed small silicone stoppers that ﬁt into each well of a 96 - well plate . These stoppers are positioned prior to seeding of the cells and create an exclusion zone with the tip of the stopper ( Oris TM cell migration assay ) . The cell density is adjusted that cells are fully conﬂuent . After cell adhesion , the stoppers are removed creating a 2 mm diameter circular cell - free area , wherein the cells then will migrate ( Fig . 2C ) . The advantages of this setup are wound zones of reproducibly similar sizes and sharp borders . In addition , there is no damage to the cells from mechanical scraping or electric ablation ( see previous section ) . Moreover , the assay is well - standardized , easy to set up and does not need special equipment for analysis . This assay is only suited for adherent cells . Care must be taken that the stoppers are tightly attached ; otherwise cells enter the cell exclusion zone beneath the silicone device . After removal of the stoppers , the wells have to be washed carefully with medium in order to prevent attachment of ﬂoating cells in the cell exclusion area , which would compromise the results . A derivative of the assay was recently developed and employs precast dissolvable biocompatible gels instead of the silicone stoppers ( Oris TM Pro cell migration assay ) . Of note , this assay is available in a 96 - well and 384 - well setting . The standard silicone stopper assay has been widely used e . g . for assessing epithelial [ 54 , 55 ] or smooth muscle cell migration [ 56 ] . Results generated with the Oris TM Pro migration assay have not been published so far . Similar replace - ment devices are also available from other companies ( e . g . Cell Biolabs , Inc . , San Diego , USA ; www . cellbiolabs . com ) . One of these devices ( Ibidi GmbH , Martinsried , Germany ; www . ibidi . com ) provides two cell culture reservoirs when placed on a cell culture dish surface . The reservoirs are separated by a 500 m m thick wall . Seeding cells in both reservoirs and removing the silicon insert from the surface results in two deﬁned cell patches separated by a cell free gap of 500 m m width . This setup also allows investigating the migratory behavior and interaction of two different cell populations seeded separately into the two different wells . As already described above , migration can be measured by photomi - crography or quantiﬁed using microplate readers if ﬂuorescently labeled cells are used . For this a mask is used to cover the areas , which are populated by the cells before starting the experiment . As cells move , they leave the masked area and can be detected and quantiﬁed in ﬂuorescence microplate readers . The detected ﬂuorescence signal is proportional to the amount of migrated cells . 2 . 4 . Fence assay ( ring assay ) The fence assay is in principle a reversion of the cell exclusion zone assay described above . Here , cells are seeded into the inner area of a Teﬂon , glass or metal fence ( ring ) placed on a standard cell culture dish ( Fig . 2D ) . The cell attachment area is restricted to the inner part encircled by the ring device : After the ring is detached , non - attached cells are removed by gently washing and the cells are incubated and allowed to migrate from the circular area in a radial way outward . The rate of movement is measured as the increase of the newly area covered by migrating cells , which is often done digitally by automated image analysis [ 57 , 58 ] . Using this assay the migratory potential of human endothelial cells was quantiﬁed [ 59 , 60 ] . In a slightly different assay cell aggregates of deﬁned size formed by centrifugation can be placed onto microscopic slides and the subsequent migration evading out of the structure can be measured [ 61 ] . Due to the same principles the advantages and N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 15 drawbacks are similar to the cell exclusion zone assays . Metal / silicone fences are commercially available from e . g . Aix Scientiﬁcs CRO ( Aachen , Germany , www . aix - scientiﬁcs . co . uk ) . 2 . 5 . Microcarrier bead assay This assay measures cell motility based on migration of the cells from microcarrier beads onto 2D cell culture vessel surfaces [ 62 ] ( Fig . 2E ) . Therefore microcarrier beads ( e . g . DEAE Dextran beads ; e . g . Cytodex beads from GE Healthcare , Chalfont St . Giles , UK ) are coated with cells . These cells can be grown to conﬂuence on the surface of the beads . Thereafter the cell - coated beads are placed onto cell culture dishes and incubated for a deﬁned period . Subsequently the beads are removed by suction . The cells , which moved to the cell culture vessel surface area , are ﬁxed , stained and microscopically evaluated or densitometrically measured . Here the advantage is that cells established close cell – cell interactions on the beads , which is more closely mimicking the tight contact of cells in vivo . In addition , due to the limited space and little cell size variation a fairly constant amount of cells are present on the bead surface ( e . g . approximately 400 HUVECs on collagen coated Cytodex beads ) , when conﬂuence is reached . Cell coating can be easily monitored with conventional light microscopy . There are always some beads , which are not or insufﬁciently covered by cells . These beads should be identiﬁed and not used for analysis . Another drawback of the assay is that the Cytodex beads are rather expensive . The initially described assay is an endpoint assay ; however , we have used live cell microscopy to monitor cell migration off the beads in kinetic experiments without ﬁxation and staining of the cells . The model was rarely used as a simple migration assay in the literature . For example it was deployed to demonstrate the negative effects of PAI - 1 on cell migration [ 63 ] . The cell coated beads are more often embedded into ECM and invasion is monitored ( see below ) . There are no commercially available kits on the market . 2 . 6 . Spheroid migration assay This assay combines 3D with 2D technologies by placing multicellular tumor cell spheroids of a certain cell type on top of a conventional cell culture dish . The assay principle closely resembles that of the above mentioned microcarrier bead assay . After attachment of the spheroid to the plastic surface , the cells start to migrate and the area of attachment is increased concentrically as the cells move out . Cell movement can be measured microscopically ( Fig . 2F ) over time . One major advan - tage compared to the above described assays is that the 3D structure of the spheroid represents a more physiologic tissue - like morphology with close cell – cell contacts and different cellular statuses as nutrient and oxygen supply is concerned . In respect to tumor biology for example , the migration of cells out of small cancer clusters can be closely mimicked . Of note , this assay is only possible if the cells investigated are able to form spheroids . Some pre - experience with spheroid formation is necessary , but this can be easily achieved . The method was used to demonstrate that tissue factor pathway inhibitor - 2 ( TFPI - 2 ) expression inhibited cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells [ 64 ] . In a different study spheroid migration was used to prove that valproic acid has either pro - or anti - migratory effects on malignant gliomas , dependent on different cell lines analyzed [ 65 ] . We currently use a modiﬁed spheroid migration assay , which reﬂects tumor – stroma interaction . Spheroids from ﬂuorescently labeled tumor cells ( genetically modiﬁed to express ﬂuorescent proteins e . g . GFP or labeled with ﬂuorescent cell tracker dyes like 5 - chloromethylﬂuorescein diacetate , CMFDA ) are formed and applied to conﬂuent ﬁbroblasts ( e . g . cancer associated ﬁbroblasts , CAFs ) , which are grown on a conventional plastic dish . This setup can be used to analyze the migratory changes upon interaction between the two cell types . Upon attachment , the tumor cells start to interact with the monolayer cells . The close interaction ensures paracrine crosstalk and direct cell – cell interaction at the migration front of the tumor cells . Migration can again be measured as increase of the attached tumor cell area over time . Fluorescent labeling helps to distinguish tumor cells from the CAFs ( Dolznig et al . , unpublished results ) . The general feasibility of the assay to analyze the interaction of cancer cell spheroids with different stromal cell types was demonstrated using colon carcinoma cell spheroids co - cultured with monocytes and ﬁbroblasts [ 66 ] . However the authors did not speciﬁcally address migration . To our knowledge there is no commercial assay available on the market . 2 . 7 . Capillary chamber migration assays ( microﬂuidic chamber assays ) In a horizontal setting two chambers are linked side - by - side by a narrow connecting bridge ( e . g . Zigmond chamber [ 67 ] , Dunn chamber [ 68 , 69 ] ) . One of the chambers is loaded with cells resuspended in medium , whereas the other is ﬁlled with medium containing a chemoattractant . The system is covered by a glass slide . A stable concentration gradient develops between the two reservoir chambers in the connecting capillary area and the number of migrating cells is counted on the surface of the connection by light microscopy ( Fig . 2G ) . These assays are often used for leukocyte migration studies . The advantage lies in the small assay volumes , making these assays well suitable for studies with rare cell types and to test expensive compounds . The use of small media volumes demands daily changes and careful humidiﬁcation of the incubator . In addition , automation processes are difﬁcult to set up with the available systems . The horizontal capillary migration chamber was further advanced to the mSlide Chemotaxis assay ( Ibidi , Martinsried , Germany , www . ibidi . com ) . It consists of two medium reservoirs and a perpendicular channel , where cells can be seeded . A gradient can be applied via the two reservoir chambers and the movement of cells can be monitored microscopically . The main advantage to the above - mentioned methods is the easy handling and the assessment of directed chemotaxis along a gradient . Recently , the capillary chamber assay was used to prove that the Src family kinase Fyn is involved in HGF - mediated chemotaxis of prostate cancer cells [ 70 ] . For HTS , 96 - well and 192 - well formats have been developed [ 71 ] and are commercially available ( BellBrook Labs , WI , USA , www . bellbrooklabs . com ) . 3 . Capillary tube migration assays The capillary tube migration assay was developed many decades ago to address leukocyte migration [ 72 ] . For this assay , glass capillaries are ﬁlled with blood , sealed and centrifuged . From the leukocyte ‘‘buffy coat’’ , which is located above the red blood cell pellet , leukocytes start to move out to the plasma layer ( Fig . 2H ) . The glass capillaries are placed onto a microscopic slide and the distance of migration can be measured by microscopy with ocular micrometer devices . This assay only needs small sample volumes and the use of multiple capillaries leads to proper statistical analyses . In an advancement of the assay , the capillaries are cut at the buffycoat / erythrocyte interface and the leukocyte containing part is placed onto plastic culture dishes . Subsequently it is covered with test medium and cells start to migrate . The size of the area of cells that migrated out of the capillary onto the plastic surface is a measure of cell migration [ 73 ] . Neutrophil migration in response to an anti - inﬂammatory response was reported using this N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 16 assay [ 74 ] . This specialized migration test for white blood cells seems not to be used any more , maybe because it vanished into oblivion . It is described here for reasons of completeness and to demonstrate its potential . Companies do not offer this assay type . 3 . 1 . Leukocyte migration agarose technique assay ( LMAT assay ) Another assay to analyze white blood cell migratory potential was introduced in 1968 [ 75 ] . This method involves a pre - cast thin agarose layer on a tissue culture dish into which circular wells were cut out in deﬁned distances . Leukocytes are loaded into one of these wells , whereas the adjacent holes are ﬁlled with different media containing either chemotactic factors , or inhibitors or controls [ 76 ] . The leukocytes migrate below the agarose layer toward the different media reservoirs ( Fig . 2I ) and the distance of movement toward the test substance ( divided by the migration distance toward the control medium ) deﬁnes the migratory index . The advantages for this assay are the easy and cheap setup as well as the simple detection method . The assay seems to be outdated ; only a very limited number of citations still using this assay can be found . In addition , this method is restricted to analyze the migration of white blood cells . The LMAT assay was employed to show that monocytes and macrophages increase the migration of neutrophils in the presence of glucocorticoid [ 74 ] and CXCL8 might be involved in reduced neutrophil migration [ 77 ] . We could not ﬁnd any commercially available LMAT assay . 3 . 2 . Single cell motility assay ( colloidal particle assay , colloidal gold single cell migration assay ) A simple way to measure migration on the single cell level is to use colloidal gold particle coated surfaces [ 78 – 80 ] . Tissue culture plates are coated with colloidal gold particles and cells are seeded onto these plates at low density ( 1 (cid:3) 10 3 cells / ml ) . The gold colloidal particles are seen as a homogenous layer of small dark dots under the microscope . The migrating single cells phagocytose the gold particles and thereby remove them from the plastic surface , resulting in white tracks , which can be photographed and the cleared areas can be evaluated quantitatively ( Fig . 2J ) . This single cell motility assay was used to track the migratory paths of e . g . keratinocytes [ 81 ] , ﬁbroblasts [ 82 ] , epithelial cancer cells [ 83 , 84 ] . This assay has also been used to demonstrate that rapamycin reduced motility of tumor cells at the single cell level [ 85 ] . The method is suitable for automation and high throughput assays and the gold particles can be replaced by quantum dots [ 86 ] . The advantages of this assay are : single cell tracking ; undirected movement ( chemokinesis ) can be monitored ; real - time path detection is possible and therefore the absolute speed of migration can be determined . Disadvantages are : intense analysis labor or automated system needed ; rather small sample sizes ( one cell – one track ) . We are not aware of a currently available assay sold by life science companies . 3 . 3 . Time - lapse / cell tracking Another possibility to analyze single cell migration is the tracking of individual cells with videomicroscopy in time - lapse experiments . The selection and tracking of the cells can either be done manually , semi - automatic or fully automatic . For automated cell tracking many algorithms have been developed which can cope with the recording of the migration path of several dozens of cells simultaneously . The automated analysis can also cope with cell division of the moving cells occurring within the recording time interval [ 87 , 88 ] . A full description of the novel automated tracking systems goes far beyond the scope of this review and is given elsewhere [ 89 ] . Essentially , the individual movement of many cells can be analyzed at once and the recorded migration paths provides information about the total movement length as well as the direction and velocity at a given time point . Time lapse cell tracking has been used for example to analyze myogenic cell motility [ 90 ] or to show that collective migration is responsible for pattern formation in co - cultures of different keratocytes [ 91 ] . As we are no specialists in this ﬁeld we do not comment on pros and cons of these systems and again refer to specialized review articles ( for example [ 89 ] ) . 4 . Invasion assays 4 . 1 . Transwell invasion assay The principal technical setup of the transwell invasion assay equals the transwell migration assay ( see above ) . In addition , the porous ﬁlter is overlaid by a thin layer of ECM , before seeding the cells into the top chamber [ 92 – 94 ] . The ECM occludes the membrane pores , blocking non - invasive cells from migrating through . By contrast , invasive cells can degrade the matrix and move through the ECM layer and adhere to the bottom of the ﬁlter ( Fig . 3A ) . Depending on the detection method , the invasive cells , which crossed the membrane pores , are either stained and counted with a light microscope , or detached , stained and lysed using ﬂuorimetric detection . The ECM can be variable and often BME obtained from Engelbreth – Holm – Swarm ( EHS ) mouse sarcomas or collagen I is used . It is recommended to calculate the ratio of invaded ( passed through the ECM coated ﬁlters ) against the migrated cells ( non - coated ﬁlters , see migration assay ) , the so - called ‘‘invasive index’’ . This determines the relative contribution of invasion to the overall motility speed [ 93 ] . The advantages of the method are the broad availability of different cell culture inserts and sizes ; the relative ease of the experimental setup and the – albeit only short – medium or cytokine / chemokine gradient between the upper ( cell culture insert ) and lower ( culture vessel ) growth medium . This method is an endpoint assay and there are some further drawbacks , if simple cell staining procedures are used . Non - invaded cells , which stayed on the upper side of the transwell insert , have to be eliminated prior to staining of the invasive cells at the bottom of the membrane . This is generally done by removing the cells with a cotton swab , which often turns out difﬁcult , non - quantitative and of variable success . We strongly recommend to use ﬂuorescent dyes , lyse the cells and quantify them in a plate reader , for reliable results . The transwell invasion assay is the most frequently used invasion assay and has for example been employed to analyze human trophoblast [ 95 ] , melanoma [ 96 ] , or colon cancer invasion [ 97 ] . Transwell invasion assay kits provided by many cell biology companies ( e . g . Becton Dickinson , Merck - Millipore , Corning ) are widely used , due to their well - standardized assay conditions and protocols . 4 . 2 . Platypus invasion assay The Platypus invasion assay ( Oris TM cell invasion assay , Platypus Technologies , Madison , USA ; www . platypustech . com ) uses the same equipment as the migration assay described previously in the cell exclusion zone assay section : small silicone stoppers ﬁtting into 96 - well plates . However , the setup of the method is quite different . First , the bottom of individual wells is covered by a thin layer of BME . Subsequently the silicone stoppers are positioned and create an exclusion zone when cells are seeded . After cell adhesion on top of the ﬁrst layer of BME , the stoppers are removed and the cells as well as the cell - free circular center region are overlaid by a thicker second layer of BME . Thereby a layer of cells embedded between two sheets of ECM is made and a central cell - free area ﬁlled with ECM is generated ( Fig . 3B ) . Invasive cells N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 17 migrate into the middle and can be followed over time with a microscope and quantiﬁed . In addition confocal analysis of the invading cells after ﬁxation and immunoﬂuorescent staining is possible ( Fig . 4A ) . This commercially available assay only provides BME as ECM substrate . However , in our experience it is possible to substitute BME with substrates such as collagen I as the ECM component ( Dolznig , unpublished data ) . Of note , the silicone stoppers can be washed , autoclaved and reused provided that a ﬁtting 96 - well plate is used ( e . g . Nunc 96 well optical bottom plates , Cat . Nr . 165305 ) . Main advantages of this invasion assay are : a well standardized assay format and a rather easy setup ; no specialized equipment is needed ; kinetic analysis is possible ; live - imaging is feasible and invasion takes place horizontally in a thin ECM layer which facilitates evaluation with a standard micro - scope ; invading cell morphology can be studied and at the end of the assay the gels can be further processed e . g . ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence analysis . Disadvantages are : no growth factor / cytokine / chemokine gradient can be formed ; the cells are embedded as single cell suspension , therefore no real cell – cell interaction is established prior to the assay . A recent publication used this assay to demonstrate that p53 inhibits tumor cell invasion via degradation of Snail in liver cancer [ 98 ] . There is also an Oris TM Pro cell invasion assay in a 96 - well setting available , with pre - applied dissolvable biocompatible gel drops , which act as cell exclusion devices . This kit is better suited for cellular screening assays because of less assay - handling time , automation suitable design and start to end live imaging possibility . 4 . 3 . 3D cell tracking As discussed above for 2D cell tracking , 3D cell tracking uses computer - aided time - lapse videomicroscopy for automated image analysis to track the path of moving cells . However , there is the surplus difﬁculty to follow individual cells in 3D environments over time ( Fig . 3C ) . Many different strategies have been developed to track either labeled or unlabeled cells in 3D matrices . These techniques include for example wide ﬁeld ﬂuorescence , confocal or multiphoton microscopy as well as contrast enhancing or digital holography microscopy . A detailed description of these techniques can be found elsewhere [ 99 ] . The major advantage of this method is that individual paths of cells travelling through 3D structures can be monitored in real time . Therefore , direction changes and the actual length of the invading cell paths can be exactly determined . However , only a limited set of cells can be analyzed simultaneously , Fig . 3 . Schemes of commonly used invasion assays . An overview of the technical setup is schematically drawn for each assay and a close up view is given right to it ( inside the circles ) . Arrows indicate the direction of cell movement . Hatched areas symbolize ECM . ( A ) Transwell invasion assay ( Boyden chamber assay ) . The thin ECM coating ( hatched areas ) , which occludes the pores of the ﬁlter is indicated . ( B ) Platypus invasion assay . Cells are seeded on top of a thin ECM coated surface and are overlaid by a second thicker layer of ECM . In the center , a silicone plug creates a cell - free exclusion zone . Therefore , invasive cells are embedded in ECM and migrate from an outer ring into the center . ( C ) 3D cell tracking assay . Cells are tracked on their route through the ECM via automated microscopy and state of the art image analysis software . Their routes through 3D space can be recorded and measured . ( D ) Gelatin degradation assay . Cells are seeded onto a thin ﬂuorescently labeled gelatin layer . At sites of invadopodia mediated matrix degradation a loss of ﬂuorescence occurs , which can be documented and quantiﬁed by microscopic imaging . ( E ) Vertical gel invasion assay ( organotypic skin model ) . Squamous epithelial cells are cultivated at the liquid – air interface on top of a collagen gel . Cells invade vertically into the collagen matrix , which can harbor stromal ﬁbroblasts as indicated . ( F ) Spheroid / monodispersed cell invasion assay . A single cell suspension of a certain cell type is incubated with preformed spheroids of a different cell type , and cells attach to and eventually invade into the spheroid . Fluorescent labeling of the cells and subsequent ﬂow cytometry after trypsinization or confocal imaging can reveal the invasive capacity of one cell type moving into tissue like structures composed of the other cells . ( G ) Spheroid confrontation assay . Spheroids from different cell types are forced to attach to each other and fuse . An invasive cell type will invade into the cell clusters of non - invasive cells , which can be visualized using ﬂuorescently labeled cells and optical or mechanical sectioning . ( H ) Spheroid gel invasion assay . Multicellular spheroids are embedded into ECM gels , which are submerged in growth medium . Invasive cells emerge from the cell clusters and give rise to astral outgrowing structures . N .

The 3D cell tracking was essential to demonstrate that migration of tumor cells is directed by the stiffness of the 3D matrix in addition to cell adhesion properties to and proteolysis of the matrix [ 100 ] . Extensive 3D cell tracking analysis was also used to prove that rapid amoeboid migration of leukocytes is integrin independent and relies on F - actin mediated protrusions and a Myosin II reliant squeezing of the nucleus in narrow pores [ 101 ] . This study used ImarisTrack ( Bitplane AG , Zurich , Switzerland ; www . bitplane . com ) , a commercially available software for 3D cell tracking . 4 . 4 . Gelatin degradation assay This assay allows visualizing and quantifying invasion at the sub - cellular level rather than analyzing the invasive behavior of whole cells . The higher resolution of this method led to the discovery of cellular protrusions called invadopodia and podosomes [ 102 ] , which degrade the ECM . The principle of the assay is to seed cells on top of a thin layer of ﬂuorescently labeled matrix and to record and measure regions where the cells degraded the matrix leaving behind areas that lack ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 3D ) [ 103 , 104 ] . The plus of this method is that sub - cellular high resolution data of invading structures can be made visible . On the other hand , cells cannot be followed as a whole during their movement . In addition the assay is not a real 3D invasion assay , since cells are attached to a thin layer of ECM and therefore adapt a 2D cell shape . Therefore invadopodia structures might be not exactly reﬂecting the 3D reality . The gelatin degradation assay was used in a study , which demonstrated that the Src substrate Tks5 is implicated in podosome mediated macrophage invasion [ 105 ] . In another report the method was employed to demonstrate that bioactive laminin - derived peptides increased invadopodia activity in adenoid cystic carcinoma [ 106 ] . This assay is also commercially available , providing either red or green ﬂuorescent labeled gelatin as extracellular matrix ( QCM TM Gelatin Invadopodia Assay , Millipore ) . 4 . 5 . Vertical gel 3D migration / invasion assays 3D migration into collagen gels were ﬁrst described using leukocytes , which were placed on top of few millimeter thick collagen gels [ 107 ] . The vertical 3D migration was monitored by optical sectioning and counting the cells or by radioactive labeling of the cells and scintillation counting [ 108 ] . Vertical invasion from epithelial cell layers can be followed by plating carcinoma cells on top of a collagen gel layer ( Fig . 3E ) . Therefore , thick collagen plugs are prepared and cells are seeded on top of the gel surface ( Fig . 3E ) . A variant of the vertical invasion assay is the upward movement of cells from a monolayer , onto which a layer of ECM has been poured . The ﬁrst mentioned assay is often used as organotypic skin model ( skin equivalents ) to study skin cancer cell invasion [ 109 – 111 ] . Here , most studies are performed in the presence of stromal subcutaneous ﬁbroblasts embedded in the collagen gel ( Fig . 3E ) . Invasion can be quantiﬁed by ( immuno ) histochemical staining [ 112 ] and quantiﬁ - cation of the invasive areas using image analysis software . The advantage is that the organotypic skin cancer model most faithfully mimics the in vivo situation for invasion . It combines 3D invasion into ECM with heterotypic cell – cell interaction of epithelial cancer cells and stromal ﬁbroblasts . Best analysis of invasion is possible with formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded ( FFPE ) samples , which are cut perpendicular to the surface . This sample processing also provides information about histological properties and cellular morphology . On the other hand , there is the drawback that sample preparation is quite labor intense and needs special equipment including embedding stations and microtomes as well as FFPE cutting experience . Using the organotypic skin cancer model it was shown that stromal ﬁbroblasts lead to collective invasion of epithelial cells [ 113 ] in squamous cell carcinomas . Recently , based on the vertical invasion assay it was shown that inhibition of autophagy resulted in impaired invasion in a glioma cell line , whereas cell viability , proliferation and migration were unaffected [ 114 ] . One impressive organotypic 3D model investigates invasion of squamous cell carcinoma cell lines seeded on top of primary human myoma tissue instead of the collagen gel [ 115 ] . Here the in vivo situation is recapitulated even more closely . So far there is no vertical invasion assay available on the market . 4 . 6 . Spheroid / monodispersed cell invasion assay In vivo tumor cells invade the surrounding tissue from cancer cell clusters . These tumor clusters are 3D structures , which can be mimicked by small aggregates of cells formed in vitro , called multicellular spheroids [ 116 ] . Cells grown as multicellular spheroids closely recapitulate the in vivo situation of solid cancers [ 117 – 119 ] . The single cell / spheroid invasion model is a model to study the invasive property of a certain cell type ( cell type A , which in most cases is a non - malignant cell ) into a tissue like structure composed of a different cell type ( cell type B ) . However , it is important to note that this assay might also be used to monitor the invasion of malignant cells into spheroid structures made of normal or non - malignant cells . In principle , spheroids of cell type B are co - cultivated with a single cell suspension of cell type A , which attach to the spheroid surface and eventually start to invade into the spheroid ( Fig . 3F ) . The use of ﬂuorescently labeled cells provides a tool to analyze 3D migration or invasion by ( confocal ) ﬂuorescence microscopy . The quantiﬁcation of cells attached to or invading into the spheroids can be done by ﬂow cytometry after trypsinization . Another possibility is to ﬁx the cells , make slices Fig . 4 . In vitro invasion assays . ( A ) Platypus invasion assay . Mesenchymal cells invade from an outer ring into the cell - free inner zone . The dashed white line indicates the rim of the cells prior to invasion . Cells are stained with F - actin in red . ( B ) Spheroid gel invasion assay . Invasive mesenchymal cells disseminate from spheroids into the surrounding collagen I gel . The dashed white line indicates the outer rim of the spheroid . Cells are stained with F - actin in red . ( C ) Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) of a similar spheroid as shown in B . The initial size of the spheroid is indicated in red . Incubation time 24 h . Astral outgrowth of invasive cells can be detected . N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 20 and perform immunoﬂuorescence or immunohistochemical anal - ysis . The main advantage of this method is that the barrier to be invaded is composed of tightly arranged multicellular 3D structures with established cell – cell interactions as it is the case in vivo . It is ideally suited to study immune cell inﬁltration in vitro . However , a prerequisite must be fulﬁlled : the cell type B has to be capable of forming spheroids , which some cell lines do not . The quantiﬁcation of invading cells is not straight forward and requires either deep confocal imaging or sample preparation for immuno - histochemistry including parafﬁn embedding and tissue sectioning equipment as well as technical expertise . If using ﬂow cytometry for quantitative detection a prior trypsinization step is required to remove the outmost cells prior to single cell dissemination . This is important to distinguish cells attached to the spheroid surface from truly invading cells . A standard protocol for this has not been developed yet . For example , the spheroid / monodispersed cell invasion assay was used to study T - cell inﬁltration in pancreatic carcinoma [ 120 ] ; to demonstrate that tumor cell spheroids can inﬂuence monocyte differentiation to tumor associated macro - pghages [ 121 ] ; or to prove that T - cadherin increased the invasion of endothelial cells into melanoma spheroids [ 122 ] . To the best of our knowledge this assay is not offered commercially . 4 . 7 . Spheroid confrontation assay The interaction and invasion behavior of two different 3D cell aggregates can be addressed with the spheroid confrontation assay [ 123 ] . In this approach , two preformed spheroids derived from different cell types ( one being invasive the other one non - invasive ) are cultivated side by side and eventually start to fuse ( Fig . 3G ) . Thereafter , cells either inﬁltrate the opposing spheroid as single cells , or collectively , or display a non - invasive phenotype . In the non - invasion case a well - deﬁned border is formed at the interface between the two cell types . One important advantage of this method is that the invasive properties of cells grown in 3D with well - established cell – cell interactions into another tissue - like structure composed of a different cell type can be studied . This is closely reﬂecting the in vivo situation in case of a carcinoma is invading a certain tissue or organ . The quantiﬁcation of invading cells requires either confocal imaging or preparation for immuno - histochemistry including parafﬁn embedding and tissue section - ing . If the cells express distinct markers , one can differentiate them immunohistochemically . Alternatively , the invading cell type can be ﬂuorescently labeled prior to the confrontation and analyzed thereafter either by live imaging or after ﬁxation and further processing . Therefore the main drawback of the assay is that it requires extensive post - experimental processing and special equipment . The prerequisite to form multicellular spheroids could represent another disadvantage . There are primary cells and cell lines , which do not form spheroids and therefore are not suitable for this kind of invasion assay . The spheroid confrontation method was ﬁrst described to study the invasive properties of cells derived from human brain tumor explants into dermal cell spheroids representing the non - invasive , normal counterpart [ 124 ] . Another study analyzed the invasive capacity of colon carcinoma cells in contact with normal skin ﬁbroblasts [ 125 ] . Recently , the spheroid confrontation assay was employed to demonstrate that NM23 - H1 regulates contact inhibition of locomotion in invading glioblasto - ma cells [ 126 ] ) ; that CXCL16 induces invasion of glial progenitors [ 127 ] ; and that Endoglin enhances breast cancer cell invasion [ 128 ] . This assay format is not commercially available . 4 . 8 . Spheroid gel invasion assays When multicellular spheroids are embedded into 3D ECM such as collagen I or BME gels ( Fig . 3H ) , non - invasive cancer cell lines stay as compact spheroids with a distinct border to the surrounding ECM and do not show any signs of invasion even after 2 weeks of cultivation [ 129 ] . Invasive cell lines ( such as the HT - 1080 sarcoma cell line , the ovarian carcinoma cell line SK - OV - 3 or the breast cancer line MDA - MB - 231 ) or endothelial cells start to invade into the surrounding matrix and display astral outgrowth from the spheroid [ 130 ] ( Figs . 3H and 4B and C ) . Invasion can be followed by live imaging and quantiﬁed by measuring the invasive area over time in photomicrographs . The gels with the invading structures can be ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence staining and confocal microscopy [ 118 ] . Alternatively , the gels can be enzymatically degraded and the cells isolated for ﬂow cytometry analysis . A third possibility is to make protein lysates and perform Western blot analysis ( Kramer , Walzl unpublished ) . The main advantage of this assay is that cell movement through a 3D matrix closely mimics invasion in vivo . Importantly , invasion occurs from cell clusters with well - established cell – cell interactions rather than from single cells , as it is the situation in human cancers . A wide range of different ECM gels ( e . g . collagen I , BME , ﬁbrin ) can be commercially obtained in their liquid forms and quickly solidiﬁed chemically or physically . Therefore different substrates are readily available depending on the research question . The outer border of spheroids placed in the gel can be easily detected in a standard inverted light microscope . In live imaging experiments kinetic measurements of cell invasion can be made . Finally , it is compatible with molecular biology analysis methods . Care must be taken to distinguish real invasion from cell movement on the surface of the gel . Some spheroids are occasionally embedded at the gel - medium interface or at the bottom in contact with the tissue culture plate and migrating cells always take the route of least resistance . If cells are situated at the gel - medium interface they migrate along the surface instead of taking the route through the gel . This falsely gives the impression of rapid invasion of that particular spheroid . These events have to be excluded from the analysis . Some experience is needed to distinguish the surface migration , which is characterized by movement of cells in a single plane and 2D cell morphology , from 3D invasion . Additionally the experimental effort is rather high compared to other assays and some pre - experience with 3D gel systems is required . The spheroid invasion system has already been used to deﬁne essential molecular pathways during 3D invasive growth [ 118 , 131 ] or to measure TGFbeta induced invasion [ 132 ] . In a very similar assay cell - coated microcarrier beads ( see above in the migration section ) can be embedded into ECM gels and invading cells can be detected . This assay format was used to investigate the destructive 3D motility in trophoblast - like cells [ 133 ] . It is mostly used to measure the formation of endothelial cell ( EC ) networks in 3D gels e . g . to demonstrate the secretion of pro - angiogenic factors by mesenchy - mal stem cells [ 134 ] or to show that ECM density inﬂuences EC capillary formation [ 135 ] . We employed this model to analyze EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 136 ] and to clarify the function of hVps37A in ovarian carcinoma [ 137 ] . Using an advancement of the method we determined invasive properties and the molecular pathways activated by the interaction of colon carcinoma cells with stromal ﬁbroblasts [ 129 ] . For that we dispersed ﬁbroblasts in the collagen gel in addition to colon cancer spheroids . This setup allows the interaction of tumor cells with stromal ﬁbroblasts in 3D , which induced cancer cell invasion in otherwise non - invasive lines . Currently we are using the spheroid invasion model to address the function of the mTOR signaling pathway [ 138 – 140 ] during invasion . So far there is no spheroid invasion assay commercially available . 4 . 9 . Conclusions and perspectives Since the acquisition of a migratory phenotype is the prerequisite for metastatic spreading , the determination of the N . Kramer et al . / Mutation Research 752 ( 2013 ) 10 – 24 21 migratory and invasive potential of tumor cells and the molecular mechanisms behind this process is fundamental for proposing novel clinical strategies in cancer diagnosis , prognosis and drug development . A wide variety of assays assess the migratory or invasive potential and activity of cells in vitro . These assays range from very simple and inexpensive ones to technical demanding or expensive solutions . However , the suitability of a speciﬁc method may be limited when considering a certain cell type ( s ) or speciﬁc research question . In this review , we offer researchers a concise and informative description of all available methods to measure invasion and migration potentials of cancer cells to employ in their investigations . We have in particular provided pragmatic description of all the available techniques and tools to choose from , including a depiction of the assay principle , advantages , drawbacks and limitations that will aid relative ‘‘newcomers’’ to the ﬁeld in choosing the most appropriate methods for their work . To evaluate cell migration , with reference to our own experience , we recommend using the exclusion zone assay for several reasons . ( 1 ) There is no need for advanced cell biology technical knowledge . Cells are mostly seeded in 96 well plates as monolayers ; the cell exclusion zone is deﬁned by a physical barrier , avoiding damage to the cells . ( 2 ) The cell free zone is reproducibly of the same average size . ( 3 ) No special technical equipment is required ; an inverted cell culture microscope equipped with a digital camera is sufﬁcient . During migration of cells into the cell exclusion zone thereby decreasing it , the wells can be photographed using conventional phase contrast microscopy ; the cell free area can be determined by image analysis tools ( e . g . ImageJ , which can downloaded free of charge from http : / / www . rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . ( 4 ) Optionally cells can be ﬂuorescently labeled before seeding or at the end of the experiment ; a mask can be applied and a ﬂuorescence signal , which is proportional to the amount of migrated cells , can be detected in a microplate reader ; this allows high throughput screening . ( 5 ) The assay allows kinetic assess - ment of migration and time lapse videomicroscopy is possible if desired . Therefore , actual migration velocity can be determined and the phenotype of the moving cells is recorded during the experiment . From our point of view these facts make the cell exclusion zone assay superior to the also widely used transwell migration assay , which reliably detects differences in cell migration , however offers less readout options for roughly the same cost input and work load . For a simple technique to measure invasion the same features pointed out above we support the use of the Platypus invasion assay instead of the widespread transwell invasion assay , despite being more laborious . If a close mimicry of the in vivo situation in tumors is desired , the following consider - ations should be taken into account . First , tissues and tumors are structures with established cell – cell contacts in the three dimensional space . Before being able to move out of these structures cells have to ﬁrst bear down the close physical contact to their neighbors or move collectively and attach to a different substrate . This is best mimicked by the multicellular spheroid migration assay , which is from our experience a good compromise between a fairly close reﬂection of the in vivo situation and manageable experimental effort . Second , it is now obvious that the cellular components present in the interstitial space , which together comprise the tumor stroma ( i . e . ﬁbroblasts , myoﬁbro - blasts , pericytes , endothelial cells , immune cells ) inﬂuence the invasive potential of cancer cells [ 113 , 141 , 142 ] . These interactions should be considered in in vitro assays to recapitulate the in vivo situation as close as possible . Some of the assays described here – i . e . the spheroid migration assay , the vertical gel invasion assay , spheroid gel invasion assay – can be used with heterotypic cell interaction and have already been demonstrated to work . Undoubtedly , these assays are labor intense and therefore error - prone and cannot be used in cellular high throughput screening . However we are convinced that they are the most sophisticated models to address cell migration and invasion in a highly relevant physiological setting and are therefore worth the additional effort .
