The folate receptor is a glycosyl - phosphati - dylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored membrane protein that mediates the delivery of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to the cytoplasm of MA104 cells . Ordinarily the receptor is sequestered into numerous discrete clusters that are associated with an uncoated pit membrane specializa - tion called a caveola . By using two different methodo - logical approaches , we found that the maintenance of both receptor clusters and caveolae depends upon the presence of cholesterol in the membrane . These results suggest that cholesterol plays a critical role in main - taining the caveola membrane domain and modulates the interaction of GPI - anchored membrane proteins via their phospholipid anchors . T HE functional specialization of a cell is reflected in the spatial organization of its macromolecular substruc - ture . Not only do differentiated cells express genes that distinguish them from other cells , but often the products of these genes are differentially distributed within the cell and at the cell surface . The generation and maintenance of these organizational patterns requires the faithful sorting of newly synthesized molecules into the correct transport pathway and their delivery to the proper target . In many instances the in - formation required for these sorting reactions is not known . In the case of cell membranes , the sorting step involves the sequestration of molecules into vesicular vehicles that carry them to the correct destination . For maximal efficiency of transport , these molecules must first be segregated from other molecules in the membrane to form domains that are enriched in that molecular species . This clustering reaction has been well documented for molecules that participate in receptor mediated endocytosis ( 20 ) but presumably also oc - curs at different stages in the exocytic pathway as well ( 15 ) . The clustering together of molecular subsets is also required for the formation of cell - cell junctions ( 40 ) , cell - substratum contact sites ( 11 ) , clathrin coated pits ( 2 ) , and microvilli ( 31 ) . The clustering of a subset of membrane molecules often depends upon the interaction of a transmembrane , integral membrane protein with a specific extrinsic membrane pro - tein , and these interactions can occur at either side of the membrane . For example , receptors involved in endocytosis are thought to rely on the cytoplasmic portion of the mole - cule for clustering in coated pits ( 2 ) , whereas acetylcholine receptor clustering is mediated by the interaction of extrinsic proteins with both the external ( 14 ) and cytoplasmic ( 32 , 34 ) portions of the receptor . Molecules might also cluster by vir - tue of their self associative properties . This is thought to be the mechanism for the formation of glycosphingolipid mi - crodomains in the membrane ( 43 ) and cholesterol - rich do - mains in liposomes ( 35 , 36 , 44 ) . Self - association may also be responsible for the segregation of certain membrane pro - teins . Most integral membrane proteins have a hydrophobic trans - membrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail . The glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) l - linked integral membrane pro - teins , however , are anchored in the membrane by a covalently attached glycoinositol phospholipid ( 16 ) . Recently we re - ported that the GPI - linked membrane receptor for 5 - methyl - tetrahydrofolate is highly clustered on the surface of MA104 cells and that these clusters are enriched over caveola , a mem - brane pit that lacks a clathrin coat ( 37 ) . Each receptor cluster contains ' ~ , 750 receptors with a density of ~ 30 , 000 molecules per / ~ m 2 , which is 50 times the density of LDL receptors in clathrin coated pits ( 37 ) . We now report that the maintenance of folate receptor clusters is dependent on the presence of cho - lesterol in the membrane , which suggests that the GPI anchor is responsible for the highly aggregated state of this membrane protein .

Compactin was obtained as previously described ( 10 ) . Rabbit anti - folate receptor IgG was obtained from rabbits that were immunized with purified human placental folate binding protein ( 5 ) . The purified IgG from these animals immunoprecipitated a single 38 - kD band from radiolabeled MA104 cells ( data not shown ) . All other re - agents were obtained as previously described ( 24 , 37 ) . Cell Culture MA104 cells , a monkey kidney epithelial cell line , were grown as previ - ously described ( 24 , 37 ) . 1 . 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 35 - rnm dishes and grown for 5 d in folio acid - free medium 199 sup - plemented with 5 % ( vol / vol ) fetal calf serum and 100 U / ml penicillin / strep - tomycin ( medium A ) . In experiments to detect LDL receptor , cells were transferred to folic acid - free medium 199 supplemented with 5 % lipopro - tein deficient serum on day 2 of cell growth . Cells were depleted of choles - terol by growing them in 5 % lipoprotein deficient serum that contained 25 # M compactin and 200 # M mevalonate for 60 h before the experiment .

After the indicated incubation , cells were rinsed with buffer B and processed to local - ize rabbit IgG with goat anti - rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate as previously described ( 37 ) . Immunogoid - labeling Procedure Cells were processed as described for the immunofluorescence experiments except that anti - folate receptor IgG was used at 100 ~ g / ml . After treatment with 7 . 5 ~ tg / ml of filipin at the indicated temperature , cells were incubated with goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 25 ~ g / ml ) for 1 h at 4°C , followed by a l - h incu - bation at 4°C with a 1 : 30 dilution of rabbit anti - goat IgG conjugated to gold . Cells were then fixed , dehydrated , and embedded in Epon ( 37 ) . For live cells , cells were chilled to 4°C , incubated with 5 # g / ml of filipin for 15 rain , fixed , and processed to localize the folate receptor using anti - folate recep - tor IgG as previously described ( 37 ) .

Quan - titation of gold particle distribution was performed as previously described ( 37 ) . Results Sterol Binding Agents Uncluster the Folate Receptor The folate receptor mediates the delivery of 5 - methyltetra - hydrofolate to the cytoplasm of MA104 cells ( 24 ) . Clustered folate receptors are easily detected by indirect immunofluo - rescence ( 37 ) . When cells were incubated at 4°C with an antibody to the receptor , fixed with formaldehyde , incubated at 4°C for 30 rain , and processed for indirect immunofluo - rescence , the apical surface of the MA104 cells displayed nu - merous bright foci corresponding to clusters of bound immu - noglobulin ( Fig . 1 A ) . If , however , the cells were incubated at 4°C in the presence of 5 ~ tg / ml of fitipin after the fixation , there was a marked reduction in the size of the foci and the appearance of bound immunoglobulin that was diffusely dis - tributed on the cell surface ( Fig . 1 B ) . Unclustering was not temperature dependent because when fixed cells bearing bound anti - folate receptor IgG were incubated in the pres - ence of filipin at 37°C , the unclustered anti - receptor IgG staining pattern was also evident ( Fig . 1 C ) . Filipin is a polyene antibiotic , a class of drugs that bind cholesterol ( 8 , 29 ) .

Cholesterol Controls GPl - anchored Receptor Clustering 2933 in the plane of the membrane ( 13 , 29 ) , we tested polymyxin B , which forms morphologically distinct complexes with phospholipids in the membrane ( 6 , 7 ) . As seen in Fig . 2 D , cells treated with this agent had normal appearing receptor clusters . Therefore , of all the reagents we tested , only those that bind cholesterol caused unclustering of the folate receptor . In contrast to the folate receptor , filipin had no effect on the clustering of the LDL receptor , an integral membrane protein that has transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains ( 20 ) . In the absence of filipin both populations of receptors appeared to have a similar , clustered distribution ( Fig . 3 A vs . Fig . 3 B ) . When MA104 cells were treated with 10 # g / ml of filipin , however , the folate receptor ( Fig . 3 C ) became dis - persed but the LDL receptor ( Fig . 3 D ) remained clustered . Receptor clustering can also be detected by immunogold labeling , where on average a folate receptor cluster has six gold particles ( 37 ) . Fig . 4 A shows that without filipin treat - Figure 4 .

Likewise , when live cells were treated briefly with filipin at 4°C , the gold label was unclustered ( Fig . 4 D ) . Reduction in Folate Receptor Clusters in Cholesterol - depleted Cells The effects of filipin as well as other sterol binding reagents on the distribution of the folate receptor suggests that choles - terol may mediate receptor clustering . If this sterol is directly involved , then cells depleted of cholesterol should have an alteration in the receptor clustering pattern . To test this hypothesis , cells were starved of cholesterol by depriv - ing them of both endogenous and exogenous sources of the sterol . By inhibiting the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol with compactin , adjusting the concentration of mevalonate in the media to provide substrate for nonsterol biosynthetic processes , and depleting the serum of lipoproteins , we were able to routinely reduce the total cellular cholesterol from 160 ~ g / mg of protein to 70 . 2 t ~ g / mg without changing the viability of the cells . These cells were morphologically in - distinguishable from cells grown in the presence of lipopro - tein deficient serum alone ; however , by indirect immunofluo - rescence the receptor distribution was much more dispersed ( Fig . 5 B ) than in cells that were grown in the absence of compactin ( Fig . 5 A ) . The number of clusters was increased and on average each cluster appeared smaller , which con - tributed to the dispersed appearance of the receptor . Addi - tion of LDL to the media of compactin grown cells for 24 h before the immunofluorescence assay restored the staining pattern ( Fig . 5 C ) to normal ( compare with Fig . 5 A ) . Electron microscopic analysis of cholesterol - depleted cells also showed that receptor clustering was affected ( Fig . 6 ) . Untreated cells had normal appearing receptor clusters , many of which were associated with caveolae ( Fig . 6 A ) . Cholesterol - depleted cells , however , had fewer numbers of gold particles in each cluster ( Fig . 6 B ) and there also ap - peared to be an increase in the number of single gold parti - cles . MOreover , there were many fewer caveolae in these cells . Addition of LDL to the media of compactin - treated cells appeared to restore both the normal clustering pattern and the number of caveolae ( Fig . 6 C ) . These observations were confirmed by quantitative analysis of gold particles and caveolae . As seen in Table I , the average cluster in untreated ceils contained 5 . 64 gold particles , whereas in cholesterol - depleted cells each cluster averaged 4 . 89 gold particles ( P < . 005 ) . Moreover , there was a 15 % decrease in the amount of gold that was in clusters . By comparison , either the addi - tion of LDL to compactin - grown cells or growing the cells in the presence of fetal calf serum resulted in the cells having normal size clusters . There also was a dramatic decrease in the number of caveolae in cholesterol - depleted cells . These cells had 10 - fold fewer caveolae as compared either to con - trol ceils or compactin - treated cells that received LDL . This reduction in the number of caveolae contributed to the de - crease in the association of clusters with this membrane spe - cialization ( Table 13 . Eh ' scussion Among receptors that ordinarily are clustered on the cell surface , the folate receptor is remarkable for its high packing density . Because the receptor lacks a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail , we originally thought that clustering would be mediated through protein - protein interactions be - Rothberg et al .

The results of the current experi - ments , however , implies that clustering is controlled by lipid - lipid interactions between the fatty alkyl / acyl chains of the GPI anchor and the surrounding lipids in the bilayer . Two lines of evidence have implicated cholesterol as the lipid that modulates folate receptor clustering : ( a ) sterol binding agents disperse the receptor in the plane of the mem - brane even after formaldehyde fixation , and ( b ) cholesterol - depleted cells have fewer receptors per cluster as well as a reduced number of receptors that are clustered . Many sterol binding reagents form precipitates with cho - lesterol in the bilayer , a phenomenon that is best character - ized for filipin ( 38 ) . These precipitates could have physically deranged the lipid bilayer and thereby caused the dispersion of the receptors . Yet polymyxin B , which also forms precipi - tates in the membrane bilayer ( 6 , 7 ) , did not disperse the receptors whereas nystatin , a sterol binding reagent that does not form recognizable precipitates , did uncluster the receptor . Therefore , most likely the sterol binding reagents have their effect by sequestering cholesterol , which effec - tively depletes the membrane of sterol . When cells were grown in the presence of compactin , as judged by immunofluorescence , receptor clustering was re - duced . By immunogold analysis , however , these conditions did not uncluster the receptors as dramatically as did the sterol binding agents . We assayed for receptor unclustering by measuring the average density of gold particles in recep - tor clusters as a function of the treatment . The immunogold method involves the addition of three different antibodies ; therefore , the number of gold particles per duster is only an approximation of the number of receptors at that site . Nevertheless , there was a significant decrease in the size of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 2936 Table L Effects of Cholesterol Depletion on Anti - Folate Receptor lgG Clusters Gold Gold in Caveolae Treatment Gold / cluster clustered caveolae Caveolae / 10 tLm labeled Lipoprotein - deficient serum Compactin Compactin plus LDL n % % % 5 . 64 + . 17 82 . 4 18 . 3 2 . 72 66 . 4 4 . 89 + . 18 67 . 2 1 . 7 0 . 27 28 . 6 5 . 86 + . 25 76 . 7 13 . 4 1 . 78 51 . 9 Fetal calf 6 . 18 + . 22 84 . 6 18 . 3 2 . 82 50 serum Cells were grown in the presence and absence of 25 txM compactin plus 200 t ~ M mevalonate as described in Fig . 5 . Cells were processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described in Fig . 4 . The data were analyzed using a Bessler Lantern Slide Projector , which magnified negatives ( n = 42 - - 49 per treatment ) to 90 , 720x . Total membrane measured for each group was > 425 ~ m . Each cluster of gold was defined as containing three or more particles . Values for the density of gold per cluster are the mean + the standard error . Based on a Student ' s t test , the cluster size for the cells grown in the presence of compactin was significantly smaller ( P < . 005 ) than for the ceils grown under the other conditions . the clusters in compactin grown cells . When LDL was added to compactin - treated cells the density of gold in each cluster returned to control levels , which is strong evidence that the observed reduction in cluster size was due to a deficiency in membrane cholesterol . As shown previously ( 37 ) , we found that receptor clusters were enriched over caveolae , an association that may be im - portant for receptor internalization . Whereas 18 % of the gold clusters were associated with these uncoated pits , > 66 % of the pits where labeled with one or more particles . Con - ceivably this association is also modulated by cholesterol . The sterol - depleted cells had 10 - fold fewer caveolae than did either control cells or cells grown in the presence of fetal calf serum and the addition of LDL to compactin treated cells re - stored the density of caveolae to normal ( Table I ) . Moreover , the percentage of caveolae that were labeled in cholesterol - depleted cells was reduced by about one - half compared to control ceils . Although we can not be sure of the accuracy of these measurements because of the tenuous microscopic criteria used to identify this type of uncoated pit , this is not the first instance where cholesterol has been implicated in the structure / function of caveolae . Simionescu et al . ( 39 ) found that in capillary endothelial ceils sterol - filipin precipi - tates are enriched around the opening of caveolae , which suggests that they are a cholesterol - rich membrane special - ization . Within these domains cholesterol may function to cause certain membrane proteins to congregate . Other GPI - anchored membrane proteins might have a similar fate ( 23 ) . Cholesterol may cause receptor clustering by modulating the phase separation of the fatty acid and fatty alcohol chains attached to the glycerol of the inositol phospholipid ( 16 ) . Al - ternatively , this sterol may maintain the clustered organiza - tion through hydrogen bonding between the fatty chains in the GPI anchor ( 36 ) . Recently Luhrs and Slomiany ( 28 ) reported that the folate receptor GPI linkage contains a 1 - O - alkyl - 2 - O - acylglycerol that has mixed fatty alcohols at the C1 and predominantly docosanoic acid ( 22 : 0 ) at the C2 posi - tion . Although the exact behavior of these types of fatty chains in the plane of the membrane is not known , there is good evidence that lipid domains exist in biological mem - branes ( 6 , 35 , 38 ) . Quite possibly cholesterol can modulate the formation of these domains ( 44 ) . Since both the cholera toxin and the tetanus toxin binding gangliosides also appear to be enriched in caveolae ( 30 , 41 ) , the interactions between certain fatty chains and cholesterol may lead to the formation of specific lipid clusters in caveolae . A surprising recent discovery is that in polarized epithelial cells GPI - anchored membrane proteins predominantly re - side on the apical surface ( 26 ) . The exact function of the GPI anchor in the proper targeting to this surface has not been determined ; however , Lisanti etal . ( 27 ) recently showed that when the GPI - attachment signal was transferred to Herpes simplex glycoprotein D , a membrane protein that ordinarily is located on the basal surface , the chimeric protein traveled to the apical surface . Similarly , Brown et al . ( 9 ) also found that the GPI anchor controls targeting of membrane proteins to the apical surface . Our results raise the possibility that clustering could play a role in the proper targeting of GPI - linked proteins to the apical cell surface . GPI - anchored pro - teins synthesized in the ER would travel to the Golgi appara - tus in a dispersed state due to the low cholesterol in these membranes ( 4 ) . Once arriving at the cholesterol - rich trans - Golgi region ( 33 ) , the proteins become clustered and this step directs the movement of the protein to the apical cell sur - face . Since certain glycolipids seem also to be sequestered into domains and reside at the apical surface of polarized cells ( 42 ) , possibly the clustering reaction is part of a general mechanism for controlling the lipid and protein composition of membranes in polarized ceils ( 25 ) . Cholesterol might have a central function in managing the traffic of certain lipids as well as lipid - linked proteins to the cell surface . In conclusion , the folate receptor has revealed that GPI - anchored proteins can be ordered in the plane of the mem - brane through lipid - lipid interactions within the bilayer . In the future this class of membrane proteins may serve as con - venient markers that will divulge new insights into the be - havior of lipids in biological membranes . We thank Dr .
