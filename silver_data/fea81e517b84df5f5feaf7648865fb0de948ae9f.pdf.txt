Microdomains in Forebrain Spines : an Ultrastructural Perspective Bence Rácz & Richard J . Weinberg Received : 2 June 2012 / Accepted : 27 August 2012 / Published online : 15 September 2012 # Springer Science + Business Media , LLC 2012 Abstract Glutamatergic axons in the mammalian forebrain terminate predominantly onto dendritic spines . Long - term changes in the efficacy of these excitatory synapses are tightly coupled to changes in spine morphology . The reor - ganization of the actin cytoskeleton underlying this spine “ morphing ” involves numerous proteins that provide the machinery needed for adaptive cytoskeletal remodeling . Here , we review recent literature addressing the chemical architecture of the spine , focusing mainly on actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) . Accumulating evidence suggests that ABPs are organized into functionally distinct microdomains within the spine cytoplasm . This functional compartmental - ization provides a structural basis for regulation of the spinoskeleton , offering a novel window into mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity .

AMPAR Introduction Excitatory signals in the mammalian forebrain are transmit - ted mainly by glutamatergic axons that terminate onto den - dritic spines of pyramidal neurons . Most spines are tiny . A typical spine in CA1 hippocampus has a volume of ~ 0 . 02 – 0 . 03 fl [ 1 ] , making them difficult to resolve with the limited resolution provided by the standard tools of live - cell imaging . Recent dramatic advances in super - resolution light microscopy [ 2 – 5 ] can provide important insights into sub - spine dynamics . However , the outstanding spatial resolution provided by transmission electron microscopy makes it the primary tool of choice for studying the fine structure of the spine , though it is unsuitable for visualization of living cells . Spine Morphology A variety of spine shapes can be distinguished , including thin , stubby , and mushroom - shaped ( Fig . 1a , [ 6 ] ) . Mushroom - shaped spines are linked to their parent dendrite through a thin neck . It has been suggested that the spine neck might help to isolate the synapse from the shaft elec - trically ( see review by [ 7 ] ) , though this idea remains con - troversial , and technical challenges make it difficult to address experimentally . In contrast , considerable evidence supports that the neck can provide a diffusion barrier for second messengers like Ca 2 + [ 8 – 11 ] . The biochemical com - partmentalization thus achieved can isolate activity of syn - apses between neighboring spines , allowing independent modulation of single synapses [ 12 , 13 ] . Spines proliferate rapidly in early postnatal life , but many of these early spines regress and disappear during maturation . Despite early suggestions that spines might be plastic or motile [ 14 ] , by the latter part of the twentieth century , it was widely thought that spines in the mature brain were stable and fixed ( see review by [ 15 ] ) . The introduction of new tools that allow direct visualization of spines in intact brain has led to the development of a more nuanced perspective . Large spines are generally stable [ 16 – 18 ] . In contrast , small spines are quite dynamic even in the adult ; current evidence suggests that many of them are transient and may either expand or disap - pear within a few days [ 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Extensive research in both hippocampus and neocortex documents a close relationship between spine size and syn - aptic efficacy [ 21 – 24 ] . Spine volume itself predicts the size B .

Moreover , stimuli that trigger long - term synaptic potentiation lead to spine growth and the insertion of additional AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane [ 30 , 31 ] , whereas stimuli that trigger long - term depression lead to spine shrinkage and endocytosis of AMPARs [ 32 – 34 ] . The causal direction of this relationship between spine size and synaptic efficacy remains unclear , but the phenom - enological evidence implies the presence of sophisticated biochemical machinery that links synaptic activity to the spine cytoskeleton ( the “ spinoskeleton ” ) [ 35 – 41 ] . Thus , a clearer understanding of the regulation of spine architecture may offer new insight into mechanisms underlying the control of synaptic processing . This line of inquiry may also have clinical implications , since several syndromes with prominent neuropsychiatric features are caused by genetic lesions directly linked to dysregulation of the actin cyto - skeleton ; these mutations can also lead to specific patterns of spine disruption [ 42 – 45 ] . Considerable recent work sug - gests that the spatial organization of relevant proteins repre - sents an important aspect of spinoskeletal regulation . Before reviewing these data , we will provide a brief overview of the functional organization of the spine . Domains at the Spine Surface When viewed with the electron microscope , the spine ’ s most prominent feature is the postsynaptic density , an electron - dense specialization extending beneath the plasma membrane , closely aligned with the presynaptic active zone across the 20 – 30 nm synaptic cleft ( Fig . 1b ) . The PSD , which serves as the primary signaling domain of the spine , contains a complex matrix of receptors , scaffolding , and signal transduction mol - ecules [ 46 , 47 ] . Notwithstanding considerable variability , dif - ferent synaptic proteins tend to segregate to distinct regions within the PSD . For example , the PSD exhibits a pronounced “ laminar ” organization ; receptors are embedded in the plasma membrane , and adaptor proteins like PSD - 95 concentrate near the exterior edge of the cytoplasm , whereas scaffolds like the Shank family lie deeper in the cytoplasm [ 2 , 48 ] . Though less conspicuously , the PSD also seems to be organized in the tangential axis along the plasma membrane ; for example , N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors generally lie in a cen - tral zone of the PSD , whereas AMPA receptors are more peripherally situated [ 49 – 51 ] . Immunogold electron microscopy has shown that a peri - synaptic zone of the postsynaptic membrane is enriched in several signal - related proteins , including mGluR1 , diacylgly - cerol lipase - α ( an essential enzyme in endocannabinoid sig - naling at central synapses ) , and the glutamate transporter EAAC1 [ 52 – 54 ] , though this zone is not morphologically distinctive . Beyond the perisynaptic region is a specialized trafficking zone for entry and exit of protein cargoes . This microdomain ( originally identified with functional live - cell imaging ) is not readily visualized even with electron Fig . 1 Appearance of dendritic spines in the electron microscope . a 3D reconstruction of serial thin sections ( from stratum radiatum of rat CA1 ) shows stubby ( s ) spines on the same segment of a dendritic shaft as spines with thin ( t ) and mushroom ( m ) shapes .

Note the presynaptic terminal with synaptic vesicles , the synaptic cleft ( arrowhead ) , and the postsynaptic density . The filamentous material in the spine head ( sp ) represents the actin cytoskeleton . Scale bars 200 nm 78 Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 microscopy , but its location has been verified using immuno - gold electron microscopy ( EM ) to demonstrate the organiza - tion of proteins associated with endo - and exocytosis [ 55 – 57 ] . It is generally assumed that the zone adjacent to the spine neck is also biochemically specialized , though little direct evidence is available . In summary , the presence of multiple functionally distinct domains along the plasma membrane of the spine is now generally accepted [ 58 ] , though the functional implica - tions of this organization remain poorly understood . Compartments Within the Spine Spines may also contain various endomembranous structures . Spines on cerebellar Purkinje cells are especially rich in smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( SER ) that contains high levels of the inositol trisphosphate receptor [ 59 ] . SER is less often associated with forebrain spines ( the focus of this review ) , but large spines in the forebrain often contain a peculiar membrane - bounded structure , the spine apparatus ( SA ) [ 60 , 61 ] . The SA , usually considered a specialized element of the SER [ 62 ] , contains high levels of calcium [ 63 ] , suggesting that it may help to regulate spinoplasmic free Ca 2 + [ 63 – 66 ] . Though endosomes appear to play an important role in synaptic plasticity , they are rather uncommon in the spines of the adult forebrain ; a serial - section EM study detected endosomes in less than half of spines in CA1 stratum radi - atum of the rat [ 67 ] . However , long - term potentiation ( LTP ) - associated spine growth is accompanied by an increase of intraspinous vesicles , pointing to the importance of membrane - trafficking events during synaptic plasticity [ 68 ] . During LTP , recycling endosomes may provide AMPA receptors to the synapse [ 69 ] , while also supplying lipid membrane to the growing spine surface [ 70 ] , thus linking morphological changes with synaptic potentiation . Con - versely , the reduction of synaptic strength during long - term depression ( LTD ) is accompanied by both internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors and spine shrinkage [ 71 , 72 ] . Aside from these vesicular structures , the spine cyto - plasm has traditionally been viewed as nondescript or amor - phous , but contemporary work challenges this view . As outlined below , recent studies suggest the presence of mul - tiple distinct domains within the cytoplasm . The Actin Spinoskeleton Spines are rich in actin [ 73 ] , a highly conserved globular protein of ~ 43 - kDa molecular weight with ATPase activity . Extensive work in model systems demonstrates that actin cycles dynamically between soluble monomeric G - actin and polymerized ~ 8 – 9 - nm diameter filaments of F - actin . These filaments can assemble into complex networks , which may undergo rapid extension and rearrangement , producing force and deformation of the plasma membrane [ 74 – 76 ] . Actin filaments also undergo “ treadmilling , ” in which filament length remains constant , while actin monomers add at the “ barbed ” end and dissociate from the “ pointed ” end . Actin is essential for basic cellular processes , ranging from estab - lishment of cell polarity and directional migration , to organ - elle trafficking and exo - and endocytosis [ 77 ] . At EM , the actin spinoskeleton typically appears as loose clumps of filamentous material [ 73 , 78 , 79 ] . Recent studies using high - resolution techniques , like electron tomography ( Fig . 2a – c ) and metal shadowing ( Fig . 2d ) , have elucidated important aspects of the structure of these complex actin networks [ 80 , 81 ] , but the functional organization of actin filaments within the spine remains unclear . Live - cell imag - ing experiments led to a “ two - pool ” model of spinoskeletal organization , which postulates that filaments are organized into a relatively stable core and a dynamic periphery [ 82 – 84 ] . Direct visualization of actin treadmilling has been demonstrated within spines using super - resolution live - cell imaging [ 3 , 85 – 88 ] . A distinct “ enlargement pool ” of fila - ments has also been described [ 89 ] , and an actin pool that directly interacts with synaptic glutamate receptors within the postsynaptic density has also been identified [ 36 , 90 ] . Actin filaments can be seen to make direct contact with the PSD [ 81 , 91 , 92 ] . While actin has multiple functions at the PSD , perhaps , its most fundamental role relates to stabiliza - tion of glutamate receptors [ 93 ] . NMDA receptors can be directly linked to actin filaments through the adaptor protein α - actinin ( see below ) . The association of AMPA receptors to F - actin filaments is less direct , via a variety of scaffold proteins , including PSD - 95 [ 94 , 95 ] , Abp1 [ 96 ] , PICK1 [ 97 ] , and neurabin [ 98 ] . Controlling the Spinoskeleton An elaborate cascade of proteins modulates F - actin remod - eling ; this protein network is crucial for regulating shape and motility in eukaryotic cells . The Rho family of small GTPases links receptors at the plasma membrane to media - tors of actin remodeling ( see [ 37 , 38 , 90 , 99 , 100 ] for information on their role in spines ) . These and other up - stream regulatory proteins operate on actin via a cohort of functionally distinct families of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) that catalyze the construction and reorganization of actin networks . Numerous ABPs have been identified in dendritic spines ( Table 1 ) . Intriguingly , these ABPs are targets of many of the same signaling pathways involved in long - term synaptic plasticity [ 101 ] . Furthermore , agents that interfere with actin remodeling also impair synaptic plasticity [ 102 ] , confirming a long - suspected functional link between actin and synaptic efficacy [ 92 , 103 ] . Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 79 Regulation of the cytoskeleton requires tightly restricted spatial control of filament dynamics . Considering their func - tional specificity and their direct linkage to actin , defining the spatial organization of ABPs within the spine makes it possible to apply the static information available via EM to deduce aspects of the dynamic control of actin , at resolution not yet possible with live - cell imaging . This possibility is of special interest for investigating the subfemtoliter volume of the den - dritic spine . Evidence from immunogold electron microscopy that functionally distinct ABPs concentrate in spatially distinct domains within the spine cytoplasm points to a complex arrangement of multiple functional actin microdomains . Based on these data , a more quantitative and geometrically realistic view of spinoskeletal architecture is emerging , complementing functional LM studies . We here review these ABP - defined microdomains , focusing on a limited set of ABPs for which high - resolution ultrastructural data are available , to illustrate general principles underlying spinoskeletal design .

Scale bar 200 nm 80 Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 Linking the Cytoskeleton to the Plasma Membrane The actin cytoskeleton interacts with the plasma membrane via a family of intermediary proteins [ 104 , 105 ] . α - Actinin , an ABP of ~ 100 kDaMW that can cross - link filamentous actin in vitro [ 106 ] , links the cytoskeleton to transmembrane proteins at cell – cell contact sites in a wide range of eukary - otic cells [ 107 ] . In neurons , α - actinin has been linked to the PSD both by proteomic screens and immunogold EM . The presence of α - actinin - 1 and - 2 isoforms in the brain has been shown directly [ 108 , 109 ] , and α - actinin - 3 was dem - onstrated in proteomic studies [ 110 ] ; the α - actinin - 4 isoform is also implicated in neural function [ 111 ] . Immunogold electron microscopy shows that α - actinin is associated with glutamatergic synapses ; in hippocampus , it concentrates in the PSD [ 109 ] ( Fig . 3 ) and is also associated with the spine apparatus ( see below ) . α - Actinin can bind directly to the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of the N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) via its central spectrin repeats , providing a direct link between NMDARs and the actin spinoskeleton [ 112 – 115 ] . The C - terminus of α - actinin can bind to the dodecameric holozyme calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) , and these two proteins may work cooperatively . LTP - inducing stimuli cause massive NMDAR - gated Ca 2 + entry into the spine , recruiting CaMKII to the PSD , as has been demonstrated by several methods , including quantitative immunogold EM [ 116 ] ( Fig . 3 ) . Concurrently , by binding to calmodulin , the Ca 2 + displaces α - actinin from the GluN1 subunit , allowing CaMKII to bind to the NMDA receptor [ 112 ] . Interestingly , the β - subunit of CaMKII has been shown to bundle F - actin [ 117 ] . Thus , α - actinin and CaMKII may function together at the PSD to modify synaptic efficacy , while also acting on the actin cytoskeleton [ 118 – 120 ] . α - Actinin can also interact with synaptopodin , a 74 - kDa ABP originally described in podocytes of the kidney which can elongate and bundle actin filaments [ 121 ] . Synaptopodin ’ s α - actinin - binding domain is crucial for its postsynaptic local - ization in neurons [ 60 , 122 , 123 ] . Both preembedding immu - noperoxidase and postembedding immunogold methods demonstrate synaptopodin in a subset of spines of forebrain neurons ( Fig . 3 ) [ 122 ] , concentrating in the spine neck and spine apparatus . This association with the SA is functionally significant ; synaptopodin knockout mice lack a typical SA [ 124 ] . Importantly , these knockout mice also display impaired LTP [ 125 ] ; moreover , synaptopodin has been implicated in memory formation in the behaving animal [ 124 ] . Turmoil Under the Surface : the Shell Domain The spinoskeleton is continually changing in response to synaptic activity . A prerequisite for this remodeling is the destruction of preexisting architectural elements to permit creation of a new network . This recycling task is performed by the actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin enzyme family , comprising three ~ 20 kDa proteins in vertebrates : ADF ( also known as destrin ) , cofilin - 1 ( the major form in nonmuscle tissue ) , and cofilin - 2 ( found mainly in muscle ) . Proteins of the ADF / cofilin family enhance turnover of actin both by increasing the rate of depolymerization at filament ends , and by cutting long filaments to expose uncapped barbed ends , permitting new filament growth [ 126 ] . These proteins are enriched at sites of motility associated with rapid actin reorganization [ 127 ] , as best documented at the leading edge and ruffling membranes of cultured fibroblasts [ 128 ] . An analogous enrichment is seen in corresponding regions of neuronal growth cones [ 129 ] . Here , we focus on Table 1 Functional families of actin - binding proteins in spines Function Name [ references ] ABPs regulating F - actin assembly Monomer sequestration Profilin [ 162 , 164 , 165 , 184 ] Depolymerization , severing ADF / cofilin [ 30 , 33 , 137 ] Nucleation , branching Arp2 / 3 complex [ 97 , 149 , 185 ] ; WASP and Scar / WAVE [ 142 , 146 ] ; formins [ 140 ] ; cortactin [ 143 ] Capping Capping protein ( CapZ ) [ 186 ] ABPs regulating network superstructure Bundling Drebrin [ 174 , 176 , 177 ] ; synaptopodin [ 60 , 124 , 125 ] ; CaMKII [ 117 – 119 , 187 ] Cross - linking α - Actinin [ 108 , 109 , 112 , 114 , 188 ] ; filamin [ 189 ] ; spectrin [ 190 ] Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 81 cofilin - 1 ( the major isoform in the brain ) , which we will refer to simply as “ cofilin . ” Stimuli that trigger long - term depression in hippocampal neurons also cause spine shrinkage . Considerable evidence implicates cofilin as an essential agent linking hippocampal LTD to structural plasticity [ 33 , 130 ] . Cofilin ’ s enzymatic activity is tightly regulated by an interplay between ( Lin - 11 / Isl - 1 / Mec - 3 ) - domain - containing protein kinase ( LIMK ) and the phosphatase Slingshot [ 131 – 133 ] . The LIMK gene is deleted in Williams – Beuren syndrome , a disorder associated with severe mental retardation and visuospatial cognitive deficits [ 134 ] ; thus , dysregulation of neuronal cofilin has clinical implications . Interestingly , cofilin - actin “ rods , ” which form under conditions of cellular stress , have been reported in postmortem studies of patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease [ 135 , 136 ] . Immunogold EM labeling reveals that cofilin in hippocam - pal spines concentrates in the immediate vicinity of the plasma membrane ( the “ shell ” ) and is sparse in the central “ core ” of the spine ( Fig . 3 ) [ 137 ] . Since cofilin is a prerequisite for rapid actin reorganization [ 138 ] , these immunogold data point to the shell domain as the most dynamic part of the spinoskeleton . Cofilin concentrates near the extrasynaptic plasma membrane , so it is not surprising that it also lies within the PSD , where it may help to regulate the postsynaptic signaling scaffold . Cofilin has been reported to play an active role in LTP consolidation via mod - ifications of both receptor number and spine size [ 30 , 133 , 139 ] . Phosphorylation inactivates cofilin , and spines enriched in phosphocofilin were reported to have unusually large synapses [ 35 , 139 ] . Conversely , cofilin is dephosphorylated and activat - ed by LTD - inducing stimuli which lead to spine shrinkage . These observations are especially intriguing because spine volume is closely linked to synapse size , which , in turn , is closely linked to the number of AMPA receptors [ 26 ] . In summary , current evidence suggests a distinct shell microdo - main that can remodel quickly in response to external signals . Branches Below the Surface Cytoskeletal remodeling requires extension and branching of actin filaments and stabilization of these branches . A number of ABPs that serve these functions have been iden - tified in model systems . The Arp2 / 3 complex , a multiprotein assembly of net molecular weight ~ 225 kDa , plays a central role in filament branching and membrane protrusion [ 140 , 141 ] . The purified complex contains one copy each of seven subunits : two actin - related proteins ( Arp2 and Arp3 ) whose tertiary structure resembles that of actin , and five additional subunits , ARPC1 - 5 . Several upstream modulators , includ - ing the nucleation - promoting neural Wiskott – Aldrich syn - drome protein , WAVE / Scar [ 142 ] , cortactin [ 143 ] , and the inhibitor PICK1 , regulate the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 97 ] . Upon activation , Arp2 / 3 acts to initiate a new “ daugh - ter ” actin filament , branching at ~ 70° from the side of an existing “ mother ” filament [ 144 ] . Activation of Arp2 / 3 in neurons promotes spine head expansion [ 145 – 147 ] . Inhibition of its activity by PICK1 , a PDZ and BAR domain - containing protein that can bind to AMPA receptors , leads to defective neuronal architecture associated with a reduction in the number of mature Fig . 3 ABP content of spines revealed by immunogold .

Shaded area represents the zone of concentration , for each protein . Scale bars 200 nm 82 Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 dendritic spines [ 148 ] . The PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interaction is also necessary for spine shrinkage during LTD [ 97 ] . Immu - noelectron microscopy indicates that the Arp2 / 3 complex concentrates in a restricted donut - shaped domain in the spine head ; label is found away from the plasma membrane but also avoids the center of the spine , lying mainly in a zone 20 – 100 nm from the plasma membrane on the “ side ” of the spine , away from the PSD ( Fig . 3 ) [ 149 ] . In model systems , the Arp2 / 3 complex is spatially restricted within the extending lamellopodium during polarized extension [ 150 ] . The restricted Arp2 / 3 zone in the spinoskeleton may represent an analogous microdomain specialized for actin branching and nucleation [ 80 , 144 , 145 , 147 ] . Deep in the Spine : a Stable but Dynamic Core The central zone of the spine head is relatively stable , suggesting that the structure of the actin network in the core may be maintained for prolonged periods . Consis - tent with this notion , recent in vivo and vitro super - resolution imaging of spines [ 4 , 85 ] indicates that the density of actin is higher in the center compared to the periphery . Since these studies imaged actin itself , the actin - related biochemical machinery could only be de - duced indirectly . Using quantitative immunoelectron mi - croscopy , three ABPs , cortactin , profilin and drebrin , have been found to localize to the central core , where they seem to play related but distinct roles in maintain - ing structural integrity . Cortactin , an 80 – 85 - kDa ABP implicated in nucle - ation , branching , and stabilization of actin filaments , can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex when phosphorylated [ 151 , 152 ] . Studies in fibroblasts show that cortactin localizes to lamellopodia , filopodia , and membrane ruf - fles , where it colocalizes with F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 153 , 154 ] . In neurons , cortactin concentrates in spines [ 155 ] . Cortactin can directly bind to NMDA receptors through its SH3 domain [ 143 , 156 ] , and quan - titative immunogold electron microscopic data show that cortactin is indeed found — though at modest levels — at the PSD . However , cortactin is at much higher levels within the spine core , 100 – 150 nm away from the PSD ( Fig . 3 ) [ 157 ] . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that activation of NMDA receptors causes cortactin to move from the spine to the dendritic shaft [ 143 , 155 , 158 ] . Interestingly , this activity - driven translocation of synap - tic cortactin is lost in the Fmr1 knockout model of fragile X syndrome , in which stabilization of both actin filaments and LTP is impaired [ 44 ] . While this and other evidence suggests an important role for cortactin in both electrophysiologically defined synaptic plasticity and behavioral models of learning , it remains unclear exactly how the loss of functional cortactin causes these deficiencies . Profilins , a family of 14 – 16 - kDa proteins , are essential for actin polymerization . By attaching G - actin to the barbed end of an F - actin filament , profilin mediates filament elon - gation [ 159 ] . Four isoforms of profilin have been identified , which are the products of four genes ( Pfn1 – Pfn4 ) . The most ubiquitous isoform is profilin - 1 [ 160 ] . Profilin - 2 has two splice variants ; 2a being primarily expressed in neurons [ 161 ] , whereas expression of profilins 3 and 4 is largely restricted to the kidneys and testes [ 159 ] . In dendritic spines , profilin plays a role complimentary to cortactin [ 162 ] . Profilin - 1 is present in most spiny neurons ; immunogold analysis reveals that profilin - 1 localizes to the spine core , though labeling is also seen in the PSD ( Fig . 3 ) [ 163 ] . An elegant study in the lateral amygdala shows that fear conditioning drives profilin to the spine head , resulting in enlarged spines [ 164 ] . Profilin - 2 has been demonstrated in the spines of cultured hippocam - pal neurons expressing GFP - tagged protein . In contrast to cortactin , LTP - inducing activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors recruits profilin - 2 from the dendritic shaft into the spine core [ 162 ] . This recruitment stabil - izes spine morphology ; moreover , blocking its translo - cation from the shaft to spine prevents the formation of LTP . Nevertheless , profilin - 1 and profilin - 2 knockout mice have normal LTP and LTD and exhibit normal learning [ 165 , 166 ] , perhaps reflecting compensatory mechanisms . Interestingly , immunolabel for profilin is often visible in the spine neck [ 163 ] , consistent with its ability to shuttle between the spine head and the dendritic shaft . The available evidence suggests that profilins are highly mobile and can enter and leave the spine head in an activity - dependent manner . Drebrins ( developmentally regulated brain proteins ) are a family of 95 – 100 - kDa actin - binding proteins . Dre - brin can bind to F - actin and inhibit its interactions with tropomyosin and α - actinin , leading to thick , curving bundles of actin filaments [ 167 – 169 ] . Two isoforms have been identified , products of alternative splicing from a single gene : the embryonic ( drebrin E ) , which is found primarily in developing spines of the rat brain at postnatal day ( PND ) 7 [ 170 , 171 ] , and adult ( drebrin A ) , which becomes common by PND 21 [ 172 ] . While both isoforms are expressed in neurons , drebrin A is neuron - specific , localizing to the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses [ 173 ] . Early in postnatal develop - ment , drebrins A and E localize to the spine shell [ 170 , 173 ] , suggesting that both isoforms play a role in spine maturation . However , drebrin A has been shown by immunoelectron microscopy to concentrate in the core region of mature spines ( Fig . 3 ) . Spines with large heads and PSDs contain higher levels of drebrin A than Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 83 those found in small spines [ 174 ] . This is particularly inter - esting in view of a recent study in neurons showing that drebrin A changes the mechanical properties of actin fila - ments , rendering them resistant to depolymerization [ 175 ] . Thus , modulation of filament assemblies by drebrin A likely plays an important role in the activity - dependent spine expan - sion and stabilization associated with long - term synaptic potentiation [ 176 , 177 ] . In summary , although the spine core is considered the stablest zone of the spinoskeleton [ 89 ] , actin filaments in the core are nevertheless regulated by the coordinated interplay of cortactin , profilin , and drebrin in an activity - dependent manner . Conclusion and Perspective Actin filaments play a crucial role in regulating both spine morphology and synaptic plasticity . The architecture of the actin - based spinoskeleton is controlled by multiple fam - ilies of ABPs . The data reviewed here suggest that these ABPs concentrate in distinct spatial domains , notwith - standing the rapid turnover of actin ( Fig . 4 ) . Since immunogold quantification relies on averaged values , it may fail to detect heterogeneity among spines [ 178 ] . However , this averaging attenuates underlying non - random distributions , so the true in vivo distribution of specific ABPs is likely to be even more restricted . These distinct ABP - defined microdomains imply a high - ly compartmentalized regulation of the spinoskeleton [ 179 ] . This conclusion is supported by observations from live - cell imaging , which also point to functionally discrete subspine actin domains [ 3 , 89 , 145 , 180 ] . Taken together , these data suggest that the spinoskeleton is regulated by spatially restricted ABP domains , which control the activity - dependent actin remodeling observed during synaptic plasticity . While suggesting hitherto unrecognized functional domains within the spine , this ABP - based view also raises a number of questions . For example , the mechanisms that target and hold ABPs in position within the spine are un - clear : how can the spinoskeleton maintain a stable architec - ture in the face of rapid turnover of actin filaments ? How dynamic are these cytoskeletal domains , and how much variability is there among different spines ? It would also be useful to know how ABP domains are localized during neural development . Since spine morphology is closely linked to synaptic plasticity , and abnormalities in spine morphology have been linked to a variety of clinical disor - ders [ 42 , 45 , 181 ] , it will be important to determine whether specific disease states are associated with specific patholog - ical changes in ABP - defined microdomains . Gaining further insight into the organization of proteins that regulate actin in dendritic spines may provide important new clues to basic mechanisms underlying mental retardation and neuropsy - chiatric disease . This will require new tools and approaches , but these new tools cannot yet replace the resolution pro - vided by the electron microscope .

Fig . 4 ABP microdomains in the spinoskeleton . Proteomic studies of forebrain synapses have identified a sizable number of ABPs in the biochemically defined PSD [ 110 , 182 , 183 ] . Some of these may be contaminants , but several , including α - actinin ( blue double ovals ) and CaMKII ( black hexagons ) , have been demonstrated with immunoelec - tron microscopy to lie within the morphologically defined PSD . Imag - ing studies reveal that actin ( small blue circles ) is more dynamic in the shell of the spine than in the center , suggesting a functional gradient of activity , from the shell to core . Consistent with these data , cofilin ( yellow circles ) — a protein responsible for depolymerization of fila - ments — is heavily concentrated in this shell domain . The presence of a distinct “ subshell ” microdomain within the spinoplasm is suggested by the accumulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( green composites ) , which mediates filament branching . The center ( core ) of the spine contains a relatively stable pool of actin . A heterogeneous pool of ABPs , includ - ing cortactin , profilin , and drebrin ( red circles ) , concentrates in this core microdomain 84 Mol Neurobiol ( 2013 ) 47 : 77 – 89 References 1 .
