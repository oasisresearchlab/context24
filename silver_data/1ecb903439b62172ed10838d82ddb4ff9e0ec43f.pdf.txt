( October 28 , 2018 ) A general scheme for detecting and analyzing topological patterns in large complex networks is presented . In this scheme the network in question is compared with its properly randomized version that preserves some of its low - level topological properties . Statistically signiﬁcant deviation of any measurable property of a network from this null model likely reﬂect its design principles and / or evolutionary history . We illustrate this basic scheme on the example of the correlation proﬁle of the Internet quantifying correlations between connectivities of its neighboring nodes . This proﬁle distinguishes the Internet from previously studied molecular networks with a similar scale - free con - nectivity distribution . We ﬁnally demonstrate that clustering in a network is very sensitive to both the connectivity distribution and its correlation proﬁle and compare the clustering in the Internet to the appropriate null model . 89 . 75 . - k , 89 . 70 . + c , 05 . 10 . - a , 05 . 65 . + b Keywords : Random networks , scale free networks , correlation proﬁle , cliquishness , metropolis , network motifs . Networks have emerged as a unifying theme in com - plex systems research . It is in fact no coincidence that networks and complexity are so heavily intertwined . Any future deﬁnition of a complex system should reﬂect the fact that such systems consist of many mutually interact - ing components . These components are not identical as say electrons in condensed matter physics . Instead each of them has a unique identity separating it from others . The very basic question one may ask about a complex system is which other components a given component interacts with ? Systemwide this information can be vi - sualized as a graph whose nodes correspond to individual components and edges to their mutual interactions . Such a network can be thought of as a backbone of the com - plex system along which propagate various signals and perturbations . Living organisms provide us with a quintessential paradigm for a complex system . Therefore , it should not be surprising that in biology networks appear on many diﬀerent levels : from genetic regulation and signal trans - duction in individual cells , to neural system of animals , and ﬁnally to food webs in ecosystems . However , com - plex networks are not limited to living systems : in fact they lie at the foundation of an increasing number of ar - tiﬁcial systems . The most prominent example of this is the Internet and the World Wide Web being correspond - ingly the “hardware” and the “software” of the network of communications between computers . An interesting common feature of many complex net - works is an extremely broad , often scale - free , distribu - tion of connectivities ( deﬁned as the number of immedi - ate neighbors ) of their nodes [ 1 ] . While the majority of nodes in such networks are each connected to just a hand - ful of neighbors , there exist a few hub nodes that have a disproportionately large number of interaction partners . The histogram of connectivities is an example of a low - level topological property of a network . While it answers the question about how many neighbors a given node has , it gives no information about the identity of those neighbors . It is clear that most of non - trivial properties of networks lie in the exact way their nodes are connected to each other . However , such connectivity patterns are rather diﬃcult to quantify and measure . By just looking at many large complex networks one gets the impression that they are wired in a rather haphazard way . One may wonder which topological properties of a given network are indeed random , and which arose due to evolution and / or fundamental design principles and limitations ? Such non - random features can then be used to identify the network and better understand the underlying com - plex system . In this work we propose a universal recipe for how such information can be extracted . To this end we ﬁrst con - struct a proper null randomized model of a given net - work . As was pointed out in [ 2 ] , broad distributions of connectivities in most real complex networks indicate that the connectivity is an important individual char - acteristic of a node and as such it should be preserved in any meaningful randomization process . In addition to connectivities one may choose to preserve some other low - level topological properties of the network . Any higher level topological property , such as e . g . the pattern of correlations between connectivities of neighboring nodes , the number of loops of a certain type , the number and sizes of components , the diameter of the network , spec - tral properties of its adjacency matrix , can then be mea - sured in the real complex network and separately in an ensemble of its randomized counterparts . Dealing with the whole ensemble allows one to put error bars on any quantity measured in the randomized network . One then 1 concentrates only on those topological properties of the complex network that signiﬁcantly deviate from the null model , and , therefore , are likely to reﬂect its basic design principles and / or evolutionary history . The local rewiring algorithm that randomizes a net - work yet strictly conserves connectivities of its nodes [ 3 , 4 ] consists of repeated application of the elementary rewiring step shown and explained in detail in Fig . 1 . switchpartners A C D B A C B D FIG . 1 . One elementary step of the local rewiring algo - rithm . A pair of edges A—B and C—D is randomly selected . They are then rewired in such a way that A becomes con - nected to D , and C - to B , provided that none of these edges already exist in the network , in which case the rewiring step is aborted , and a new pair of edges is selected . The last restric - tion prevents the appearance of multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes . It is easy to see that the number of neighbors of every node in the network remains unchanged after an elemen - tary step of this randomization procedure . The directed network version of this algorithm separately conserves the number of upstream and downstream neighbors ( in - and out - degrees ) of every node . Another simple numerical algorithm generating such a random network “from scratch” was proposed in [ 2 , 5 ] . It starts with assigning to each node a number k i of “edge stubs” equal to its desired connectivity . A random net - work is then constructed by randomly picking two such edge stubs and joining them together to form a real edge connecting these two nodes . One of the limitations of this “stub reconnection” algorithm is that for broad dis - tribution of connectivities , which is usually the case in complex networks [ 1 ] , the algorithm generates multiple edges joining the same pair of hub nodes . This prob - lem cannot be avoided by simply not allowing multiple edges to form during the reconnection process as in this case the whole algorithm would get stuck in a conﬁgu - ration in which the remaining edge stubs have no eligi - ble partners . Fortunately the local rewiring algorithm [ 3 , 4 ] instead of completely deconstructing a network and then randomly putting it back together , only gradually changes its wiring pattern . Hence , any topological con - straint such as e . g . that of no multiple edges , or no dis - connected components , can be maintained at each step of the way . Once an ensemble of randomized versions of a given complex network is generated , the abundance of any topological pattern is compared between the real network and characteristic members of this ensemble . This com - parison can be quantiﬁed using two natural parameters : 1 ) the ratio R ( j ) = N ( j ) / N r ( j ) , where N ( j ) is the num - ber of times the pattern j is observed in the real network , and N r ( j ) is the average number of its occurrences in the ensemble of its random counterparts ; 2 ) the Z - score of the deviation deﬁned as Z ( j ) = [ N ( j ) − N r ( j ) ] / ∆ N r ( j ) , where ∆ N r ( j ) is the standard deviation of N r ( j ) in the randomized ensemble . This general idea was recently ap - plied to protein networks in yeast [ 3 ] and E . coli [ 6 ] . We now illustrate our general methods using the exam - ple of the Internet , deﬁned on the level of Autonomous Systems ( AS ) . Autonomous Systems are large groups of workstations , servers , and routers usually belonging to one organization such as e . g . a university , or a business enterprise . The data on direct connections between Au - tonomous Systems is regularly updated and is available on the website of the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research [ 12 ] . Such coarse - grained structure of the Internet was a subject of several recent studies [ 7 – 10 ] . In the following analysis we use the millennium snapshot of the Internet ( data from January 2 , 2000 ) , when N = 6474 Autonomous Systems were linked by E = 12572 bi - directional edges . It was recently reported [ 7 ] that the Internet is char - acterized by a scale - free distribution of AS connectivi - ties p ( K ) ∝ 1 / K γ = 1 / K 2 . 1 ± 0 . 2 . One can show that for such a scale - free network the above mentioned con - straint of no multiple connections between nodes is ex - tremely important . Indeed , the connectivity of two largest connected hubs in a scale - free networks scales as k max ∼ N 1 / ( γ − 1 ) . In an uncorrelated random net - work with no constraints on edge multiplicity the ex - pected number of edges connecting these two hubs scales as k 2 max / ( 2 E ) ∼ N 2 / ( γ − 1 ) − 1 and increases indeﬁnitely for γ < 3 ( here we assumed that E ∼ N ) . For the Internet that corresponds to two largest hubs with connectivities of respectively K 0 = 1458 and K 1 = 750 being connected by a swooping K 0 K 1 / ( 2 E ) = 1458 · 750 / ( 2 · 12572 ) = 43 . 5 edges ! Hence , in this case a random network ensemble generated by our local rewiring algorithm is very diﬀer - ent from the one generated by the stub reconnection al - gorithm and analytically studied in [ 2 ] . Fig . 2 shows the average connectivity h K 1 i K 0 of neigh - bors of nodes with the connectivity K 0 in the real Inter - net ( squares ) as well as in a typical random network with no multiple connections between nodes generated by our local rewiring algorithm ( circles ) . From this ﬁgure it is clear that most of the h K 1 i K 0 ∝ K − 0 . 5 0 dependence re - ported in Ref . [ 8 ] is reproduced in our random ensemble and hence can be attributed to the eﬀective repulsion between hubs due to the constraint of having no more than one edge directly connecting them to each other . In the absence of correlations between node connectivi - ties by deﬁnition h K 1 i K 0 = const = h K 2 i / h K i [ 2 ] . This expression , shown as a horizontal line in Fig . 2 , applies 2 only to a randomized network in which multiple edges are allowed . In an ensemble of random scale - free net - works with no multiple edges the conditional probabil - ity distribution P ( K 1 | K 0 ) crosses over between K 1 / K γ 1 for K 1 ≪ K ∗ 1 = 2 E / K 0 to 1 / K γ 1 power law tail for K 1 ≫ K ∗ 1 . This makes h K 1 i K 0 to asymptotically scale as K γ − 3 0 . We have conﬁrmed numerically that P ( K 1 | K 0 ) in our randomized ensemble has a very similar shape to that observed in the real Internet [ 10 ] . From the above discussion one may get the impres - sion that the topology of the Internet is in perfect agree - ment with its randomized version . This is however not true . Let N ( K 0 , K 1 ) to denote the total number of edges connecting nodes with connectivities K 0 , and K 1 . This is an example of a higher level topologi - cal property of a complex network , which can be com - pared to its typical value N r ( K 0 , K 1 ) in the appropri - ate null - model network . By comparing N ( K 0 , K 1 ) and N r ( K 0 , K 1 ) one measures the correlation proﬁle of the complex network , formed by correlations in connectiv - ities of neighboring nodes . In Fig . 3 we visualize the correlation proﬁle of the Internet by plotting the ra - tio R ( K 0 , K 1 ) = N ( K 0 , K 1 ) / N r ( K 0 , K 1 ) . Regions on the K 0 − K 1 plane , where R ( K 0 , K 1 ) is above ( below ) 1 correspond to enhanced ( suppressed ) connections be - tween nodes with these connectivities in the Internet compared to its randomized counterpart . The statistical signiﬁcance of these deviations , measured by the Z - score Z ( K 0 , K 1 ) = ( N ( K 0 , K 1 ) − N r ( K 0 , K 1 ) ) / ∆ N r ( K 0 , K 1 ) , is shown in Fig . 4 Our analysis is based on an ensemble of 1000 randomized networks with connectivities logarith - mically binned into two bins per decade . In Figs . 3 , 4 one can see several prominent features : • Strong suppression of edges between nodes of low connectivity 3 ≥ K 0 , K 1 ≥ 1 . • Suppression of edges between nodes that both are of intermediate connectivity 100 > K 0 , K 1 ≥ 10 , • Strong enhancement of the number of edges con - necting nodes of low connectivity 3 ≥ K 0 ≥ 1 to those with intermediate connectivity 100 > K 1 ≥ 10 . On the other hand any pair among 5 hub nodes with K 0 , K 1 > 300 was found to be connected by an edge , both in the real network , and in a typical random sample . Hence R ( K 0 , K 1 ) is close to 1 in the upper right corner of Fig . 3 . The strong suppression of connections between pairs of nodes of low connectivity can in part be attributed to the constraint that all AS on the Internet have to be connected to each other by at least one path . We have explicitly checked that there are indeed no isolated clus - ters in our data for the Internet . However , when we used an ensemble of random networks in which the forma - tion of isolated clusters was prevented at every rewiring step , we found very little change in the observed cor - relation proﬁle . The division of all nodes on the In - ternet into three distinct groups of low - , intermediate - , and highly - connected ones visible in its correlation proﬁle may be due to its hierarchical structure of , correspond - ingly , users , low - level ( possibly regional ) Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) , and high - level ( global ) ISP . Similar hi - erarchical picture was recently suggested in Ref . [ 11 ] on the basis of the traceroute data . It is worthwhile to note that the correlation proﬁle of the Internet measured in this work makes it qualitatively diﬀerent from yeast protein networks analyzed by us ear - lier [ 3 ] . Those molecular networks are characterized by suppressed connections between nodes of very high con - nectivity , and increased number of links between nodes of intermediate connectivity . Thus correlation proﬁle al - lows one to diﬀerentiate between otherwise very similar scale - free networks in various complex systems . The correlation proﬁle is by no means the only topolog - ical pattern one can investigate in a given complex net - work , with other examples being its spectral dimension [ 13 ] , the betweenness of its edges and nodes [ 14 , 8 ] , feed - back , feed - forward loops , and other small network motifs [ 6 ] . In the rest of this paper we analyze the level of clus - tering [ 15 ] of the Internet , quantiﬁed by its number of loops of length 3 ( triangles ) . The real Internet contains 6584 such loops , while its random counterparts , gener - ated by our local rewiring algorithm , have 8636 ± 224 triangles ( this and all future results were measured in an ensemble of 100 randomized networks . ) Thus the clus - tering of the real Internet is some 9 standard deviations below its value in a randomized network ! This result is surprising because there are good reasons for the Inter - net to have above average level of clustering . Indeed , one expects its nodes to preferentially link according to their geographical location [ 8 , 9 ] , general type of business or academic enterprises they represent , etc . All these fac - tors usually tend to increase clustering [ 15 ] . On the other hand , the correlation proﬁle of the Internet visualized in Fig . 3 naturally leads to the reduction in clustering . In - deed , the suppression of connections between nodes of intermediate connectivity in favor of nodes of low con - nectivity should reduce the number of triangles in the network . In order to explore the interplay between the level of clustering in the network and its correlation proﬁle we studied two “extremal” random networks with the same connectivities of nodes as the real Internet . The ﬁrst net - work contained no triangles , while the second one had a swooping 59144 triangles . Both networks were generated using a simple modiﬁcation of our basic local rewiring algorithm in which a rewiring step was accepted only if it did not increase ( in the ﬁrst case ) or decrease ( in the second case ) the number of triangles in the network . In the ﬁrst case after some transient time all triangles have disappeared from the network , at which point we mea - sured its correlation proﬁle ( Fig . 5 ) . In the second case our algorithm was designed to generate a network with 3 the largest possible number of triangles . Computer time limitations have forced us to stop the program when we reached 59144 triangles , which as will be shown later is rather close to the absolute maximum of 63844 triangles for a given set of node connectivities . The correlation proﬁle of this very clustered network is shown in Fig . 6 . From Fig . 5 one concludes that the correlation proﬁle in which connections between hubs are suppressed in favor of connections between hubs and nodes of low connectiv - ity favors a reduced number of triangles . If instead nodes with similar connectivities ( including hubs ) prefer to con - nect to each other ( the light - colored area on or around the diagonal in Fig . 6 ) the number of triangles is typically increased . This in fact can be also demonstrated ana - lytically . Consider an edge connecting a pair of nodes with connectivities K 0 and K 1 . The maximal number of triangles containing this edge is min ( K 0 − 1 , K 1 − 1 ) . Indeed , in the best case scenario all K − 1 remaining neighbors of the smaller connectivity node are also neigh - bors of the larger connectivity node . Therefore , given a correlation proﬁle speciﬁed by N ( K 0 , K 1 ) - the number of edges connecting nodes with connectivities K 0 , K 1 - the absolute maximum number of triangles in the net - work is given by N max∆ = P K 0 , K 1 N ( K 0 , K 1 ) min ( K 0 − 1 , K 1 − 1 ) / 6 . Here the factor 1 / 6 corrects for the fact that in our counting scheme each triangle would be counted 2 times along each of its three sides . Using identities min ( K 0 − 1 , K 1 − 1 ) = ( K 0 − 1 + K 1 − 1 ) / 2 − | K 0 − K 1 | and P K 0 , K 1 N ( K 0 , K 1 ) ( K 0 − 1 ) = P K 0 , K 1 N ( K 0 , K 1 ) ( K 1 − 1 ) = N h K ( K − 1 ) i one ﬁnally gets : N max∆ = N h K ( K − 1 ) i 6 − − 1 6 X K 0 , K 1 N ( K 0 , K 1 ) | K 0 − K 1 | . ( 1 ) The ﬁrst part of this expression corresponds to a hypo - thetical situation of the maximal cliquishness in which all neighbors of every node are connected to each other . It is easy to see that except for some very special cases of the distribution of connectivities such maximal cliquishness can never be realized . Indeed , whenever a pair of nodes of unequal connectivities K 0 , K 1 are connected to each other the second term in the Eq . 1 decreases the maxi - mal number of triangles . Given the set of node connec - tivities K i , one can easily construct the network with the largest possible number of triangles . One starts by con - necting the largest hub node to other nodes in the order of decreasing connectivities . In the second round of this algorithm one selects the remaining neighbors of the sec - ond largest hub in the order of decreasing connectivity . The process continues round by round until neighbors of all nodes are speciﬁed . When a node reaches its de - sired connectivity it will be simply skipped during later rounds of this algorithm . One can show that the net - work generated by this algorithm has the smallest value of P K 0 , K 1 N ( K 0 , K 1 ) | K 0 − K 1 | and the largest number of triangles among all networks with a given set of node connectivities . In case of the Internet such network has 63 , 884 triangles just below the N max∆ = 64 , 702 speci - ﬁed by its correlation proﬁle . These numbers of trian - gles are an order of magnitude below the naive estimate N h K ( K − 1 ) i / 6 ≃ 690 , 000 traditionally used as a nor - malization factor in the formula for the clustering coeﬃ - cient of a network [ 15 ] . Hence , based on their deﬁnition even the loopiest network with the same node connectiv - ities as the Internet has a clustering coeﬃcient of only 0 . 09 ! For the “native” correlation proﬁle of the Internet Eq . 1 predicts the maximal number of triangles close to 24 , 000 , which sets the observed level of clustering ( 6584 triangles ) around 27 % of its maximal value for this cor - relation proﬁle . In order to check if connectivity correlations visible in the correlation proﬁle of the internet ( Fig . 3 ) can fully account for its number of triangles we generated an en - semble of random networks that preserves not only con - nectivities but also the correlation proﬁle of the complex network . To this end we used a modiﬁcation of our main local rewiring algorithm . There are two principal ways in which this can be done . In the ﬁrst scheme , reminis - cent of generating a microcanonical ensemble in statisti - cal physics , one allows only for those local rewiring steps that strictly conserve the number of edges N ( K 0 , K 1 ) be - tween nodes with connectivities K 0 , K 1 . This is achieved by constraining the selection of pairs of edges for the rewiring step of Fig . 1 only to those connecting nodes with connectivities K 0 , K 1 , and K 0 , K ′ 1 . It is easy to see that such a local rewiring step strictly conserves N ( K 0 , K 1 ) . In practice we softened randomization con - straints by coarse - graining the logarithm of connectiv - ity to half - decade bins . Using this “microcanonical al - gorithm” we generated an ensemble of networks with 4132 ± 75 loops . The fact that the number of loops in the real Internet ( 6584 ) is now signiﬁcantly larger than in these random networks , conﬁrms the intuitive notion that the Internet is indeed characterized by a signiﬁcant degree of clustering . We have also found that this 60 % increase in the level of clustering is equally spread over the whole spectrum of connectivities . As is always the case with microcanonical algorithms one should worry if the above algorithm is ergodic . In other words there is no guarantee that in this algorithm the system does not get trapped in a disconnected com - ponent of the phase space . This is easily checked by annealing the network using a canonical Metropolis algo - rithm [ 16 ] with an energy function or Hamiltonian , which in our case can be deﬁned as H = P K 0 , K 1 [ N ( K 0 , K 1 ) − N r ( K 0 , K 1 ) ] 2 / N ( K 0 , K 1 ) , and sampling networks at a ﬁ - nite temperature T . Local moves lowering the Hamilto - nian are always accepted , while those increasing it by ∆ H are only accepted with the probability exp ( − ∆ H / T ) . As seen in Fig . 7 the above algorithm nicely extrapolates be - tween the microcanonical algorithm for small T and the unrestricted local rewiring algorithm for large T . This conﬁrms that our microcanonical algorithm is indeed er - 4 godic . Another conceivable use of the Metropolis algorithm described above is to generate an artiﬁcial network with a given distribution of connectivities p ( K ) and a given correlation proﬁle R ( K 0 , K 1 ) . To achieve this one ﬁrst generates a seed network with a given p ( K ) , e . g . by the stub reconnecting algorithm of Ref . [ 5 , 2 ] . This network is ﬁrst annealed using the Metropolis algorithm with the en - ergy functional punishing multiple connections between nodes . The resulting network , containing no multiple connections is subsequently annealed with another en - ergy functional favoring the desired correlation proﬁle . This results in an ensemble of random networks with no multiple connections between nodes and the desired cor - relation proﬁle . In summary we have proposed a general algorithm to detect characteristic topological features in a given com - plex network . In particular , we introduced the concept of the correlation proﬁle , which allowed us to quantify dif - ferences between diﬀerent complex networks even when their connectivity distributions are similar to each other . Applied to the Internet , this proﬁle identiﬁes hierarchi - cal features of its structure , and helps to account for the level of clustering in this network .
