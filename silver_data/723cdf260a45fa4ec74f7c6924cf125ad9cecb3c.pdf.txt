This scaling identiﬁes these cells as soft glassy materials existing close to a glass transition , and implies that cytoskeletal proteins may regulate cell mechanical properties mainly by modulating the effective noise temperature of the matrix . The practical implications are that the effective noise temperature is an easily quantiﬁed measure of the ability of the cytoskeleton to deform , ﬂow , and reorganize .

Rr Mechanical stresses and resulting deformations play central roles in cell contraction , spreading , crawling , invasion , wound healing , and division , and have been implicated in regulation of protein and DNA synthesis and programed cell death [ 1 ] . If the cytoskeleton were simply an elastic body , it would maintain its structural integrity by developing internal elastic stresses to counterbalance what - ever force ﬁelds it might be subject to . However , those same elastic stresses would tend to oppose—or even pre - clude altogether —other essential mechanical functions such as cell spreading , crawling , extravasation , invasion , division , and contraction , all of which require the cell to “ﬂow” similar to a liquid . A liquidlike cell , however , would be unable to maintain its structural integrity . The classical resolution of this paradox has been the idea that cytoskele - tal polymers go through a sol - gel transition , allowing the cytoskeleton to be ﬂuidlike in some circumstances ( the sol phase ) and solidlike in others ( the gel phase ) [ 2 – 4 ] . The data presented here suggest that , rather than being thought of as a gel , the cytoskeleton may be thought of more properly as a glassy material existing close to a glass transition , and that disorder and metastability may be essential features underlying its mechanical functions . We coated ferrimagnetic microbeads ( 4 . 5 m m diameter ) with a synthetic RGD ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) - containing peptide ( Integra Life Sciences ) and bound them speciﬁcally to in - tegrin receptors on the surface of human airway smooth muscle ( HASM ) cells ( Figs . 1a and 1b ) . The beads were magnetized horizontally and then twisted vertically by an external homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld that was varying si - nusoidally in time ( Fig . 1c ) . Lateral bead displacement in response to the resulting oscillatory torque was detected by a charge - coupled de - vice camera ( JAI CV - M10 ) mounted on an inverted micro - scope . Image acquisition ( exposure time : 0 . 1 ms ) was phase locked to the twisting ﬁeld so that 16 images were acquired during each twisting cycle . Heterodyning was used at twisting frequencies . 1 Hz . The images were analyzed using an intensity - weighted center - of - mass algo - rithm in which subpixel arithmetic allowed the determina - tion of bead position with an accuracy of 5 nm ( rms ) . The speciﬁc torque , T , is the mechanical torque per bead volume , and has dimensions of stress ( Pa ) . The ratio of the complex speciﬁc torque ˜ T to the resulting complex bead displacement ˜ d deﬁnes a complex elastic modulus of the cell ˜ g (cid:1) ˜ T (cid:1) f (cid:2)(cid:3) ˜ d (cid:1) f (cid:2) , and has dimensions of Pa (cid:3) nm . For each bead , we computed the elastic modulus g 0 ( the real part of ˜ g ) , the loss modulus g 00 ( the imaginary part of ˜ g ) , and the loss tangent h ( the ratio g 00 (cid:3) g 0 ) . These measurements could be transformed into traditional elas - tic and loss moduli by a geometric factor a that depends on the shape and thickness of the cell , and the degree of bead embedding , where ˜ G (cid:1) a ˜ g . Finite element analysis of cell deformation for a representative bead - cell geome - try ( assuming homogeneous and isotropic elastic proper - ties with 10 % of the bead diameter embedded in a cell 5 m m high ) sets a to 6 . 8 m m . This geometric factor need serve only as a rough approximation because it cancels out in the scaling procedure described below , which is model independent . FIG . 1 .

The loss tangent and the frequency dependence of G 0 and G 00 varied little between beads , however . Importantly , G 0 and G 00 were found to be constant over a wide range of speciﬁc torque amplitudes ( 1 . 8 – 130 Pa ) and lateral bead displacement amplitudes ( 5 – 500 nm ) , implying linear me - chanical behavior in this range . G 0 increased weakly with frequency and followed a power law , f 0 . 17 ( Fig . 2a ) . G 00 also followed a weak power law at low frequencies , but beyond 10 Hz progressively stronger frequency dependence emerged , approaching but never quite attaining a power - law exponent of 1 , which would be characteristic of a Newtonian viscosity ( Fig . 2b ) . G 0 was larger than G 00 for twisting frequencies below 300 Hz ( Fig . 2d ) , and the loss tangent remained almost constant between 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 over the lower four frequency decades . We found similar behavior when human bronchial epithelial cells were probed between 0 . 1 and 10 Hz using atomic force microscopy ( data not shown ) .

The solid lines are the ﬁt of Eq . ( 1 ) to the data and have been obtained by minimizing mean square residuals for all G 0 and G 00 data over the measurement bandwidth ( G 0 (cid:1) 53 . 6 kPa , F 0 (cid:1) 2 . 5 3 10 8 rad (cid:3) s , m (cid:1) 1 . 41 Pa s ) .

( d ) G 0 and G 00 vs f under control conditions . frequency have been obtained with different techniques in several other cell types [ 6 – 10 ] . Experimental models of cell rheology using semidilute F - actin solutions [ 11 ] , however , display rheological characteristics that can differ rather substantially from the weak power law behavior observed in living cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Addition of the contractile agonist histamine to HASM cells caused G 0 and G 00 to increase ( Figs . 2a and 2b ) . The loss tangent and the exponent of the power law fell slightly . By contrast , ablating baseline contractile tone with N 6 , 2 0 - O - dibutyryladenosine 3 0 , 5 0 - cyclic monophos - phate ( DBcAMP ) caused G 0 and G 00 to fall , and the loss tangent and exponent to increase . When actin ﬁlaments were disrupted with cytochalasin D , G 0 and G 00 fell even more , and the loss tangent and exponent increased further . These data , taken together , cannot be explained by receptor - ligand dynamics as would be the case if there were repetitive peeling of the bead away from the cell surface and subsequent reattachment with each bead oscillation . Neither can these data be readily explained by changes in cell membrane mechanics . Rather , these data are more consistent with the notion that the bead binds avidly to the cytoskeleton via focal adhesions , and that the cytoskeleton is deformed as the bead rotates ( Fig . 1 ) . Accordingly , G 0 and G 00 predominantly reﬂect the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton . This view is further supported by experiments using beads coated with acetylated low den - sity lipoprotein ( acLDL ) ; those beads bind to scavenger receptors which do not form focal adhesion complexes [ 12 ] . We found that baseline values of G 0 and G 00 mea - sured with acLDL - coated beads were smaller by ﬁvefold compared with beads bound to integrins , and demon - strated an attenuated response to contractile agonists . Structural damping . —The data in Fig . 2 conform closely to an empirical law that is known in the engineer - ing literature as structural damping or hysteretic damping [ 13 – 18 ] . Accordingly , ˜ G (cid:1) G 0 µ v F 0 ∂ x 2 1 (cid:1) 1 1 j h (cid:2) G (cid:1) 2 2 x (cid:2) cos p 2 (cid:1) x 2 1 (cid:2) 1 j vm , ( 1 ) where h (cid:1) tan (cid:1) x 2 1 (cid:2) p (cid:3) 2 , and v is the radian frequency 2 p f . G 0 and F 0 are scale factors for stiffness and fre - quency , respectively , G denotes the gamma function , m is a Newtonian viscous term , and j is the unit imaginary number p 2 1 . G 0 and m depend on bead - cell geometry . h has been called the hysteresivity or the structural damp - ing coefﬁcient . The elastic modulus corresponds to the real part of Eq . ( 1 ) , which increases for all v according to the power - law exponent , x 2 1 . The loss modulus corre - sponds to the imaginary part of Eq . ( 1 ) and includes a com - ponent that is a frequency - independent fraction ( h ) of the elastic modulus ; such a direct coupling of the loss modu - lus to the elastic modulus is the characteristic feature of structural damping behavior [ 18 ] . The loss modulus also includes a Newtonian viscous term , j vm , which comes into play only at higher frequencies . At low frequencies , 148102 - 2 148102 - 2 V OLUME 87 , N UMBER 14 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 1 O CTOBER 2001 the loss tangent h approximates h . In the limit that x ap - proaches unity , the power - law slope approaches zero , G 0 approaches G 0 , and h approaches zero . Thus , Eq . ( 1 ) de - scribes a relationship between changes of the exponent of the power law and the transition from solidlike ( x (cid:1) 1 ) to ﬂuidlike ( x (cid:1) 2 ) behavior . Unexpectedly , we could ﬁt Eq . ( 1 ) to the data in Fig . 2 using only a single value for G 0 and for F 0 . This implies a common intersection of the G 0 vs f curves when extrapo - lated outside the measurement range ( Fig . 2c ) . Further , m was found to vary little with cellular manipulations . This leaves x as the sole free parameter in Eq . ( 1 ) . Master curves . —We estimated x directly from the mea - sured power - law dependence of G 0 on f . We then deﬁned a normalized stiffness G as being G 0 measured at 0 . 75 Hz ( an arbitrary choice ) divided by G 0 , which causes the geo - metric factor a to cancel out . G vs x for all manipu - lations followed the relationship shown in Fig . 3a ( black symbols ) . Similarly , h ( measured as the ratio of G 00 (cid:3) G 0 at 0 . 75 Hz ) vs x followed the relationship shown in Fig . 3b ( black symbols ) . When we studied a variety of cell types , corresponding data were found in every case to conform to Eq . ( 1 ) ; G 0 and m differed between cell types , but F 0 was invariant ( 2 . 5 3 10 8 rad (cid:3) s ) . Despite important differences in the elastic and fric - tional material properties , all data collapsed onto the very same relationships as did the HASM cells ( Fig . 3 ) . These relationships thus represent universal master curves in that a single free parameter , x , deﬁned the constitutive elastic and frictional behaviors for a variety of cytoskeletal ma - nipulations , for ﬁve frequency decades , and for diverse cell types . The normalization that leads to these master curves is model independent . Nonetheless , these master curves fell close to the predictions from Eq . ( 1 ) ( solid black lines ) . Soft glassy materials . —An attractive physical interpre - tation for the parameter x comes from the physics of soft glassy materials ( SGM ) . The empirical criteria that de - ﬁne this class of material are that G 0 and G 00 increase with FIG . 3 ( color ) . Master curves ( G and h at 0 . 75 Hz vs x ) of HASM cells ( black , n (cid:1) 256 ) , human bronchial epithelial cells ( blue , n (cid:1) 142 ) , mouse embryonic carcinoma cells ( F9 ) cells ( pink , n (cid:1) 50 ) , mouse macrophages ( J774A . 1 ) ( red , n (cid:1) 46 ) and human neutrophils ( green , n (cid:1) 42 ) under control condi - tions ( (cid:1) ) , treatment with histamine ( (cid:2) ) , FMLP ( (cid:5) ) , DBcAMP ( (cid:4) ) , and cytoD ( (cid:3) ) . Equation ( 1 ) predicts the black solid curves : ln G (cid:1) (cid:1) x 2 1 (cid:2) ln (cid:1) v (cid:3) F 0 (cid:2) with F 0 (cid:1) 2 . 5 3 10 8 rad (cid:3) s , and h (cid:1) tan (cid:4)(cid:1) x 2 1 (cid:2) p (cid:3) 2 (cid:5) . Error bars indicate 6 1 standard error . weak power - law dependencies upon frequency , and that the loss tangent is frequency insensitive and of the order 0 . 1 [ 19 , 20 ] . Accordingly , the data in Figs . 2 and 3 estab - lish that the cells studied here behaved as soft glassy ma - terials . Surprisingly , other materials in the class include foams , emulsions , colloid suspensions , pastes , and slurries [ 20 , 21 ] . Existing models of viscoelasticity have thus far failed to provide a satisfactory explanation of the rheology of SGMs [ 17 , 20 ] . Moreover , it is unclear how such diverse systems express mechanical behavior that is so much alike . It has been suggested by Sollich [ 20 ] that the common rheological features of this class may be not so much a reﬂection of the particular molecules or molecular mecha - nisms as they are a reﬂection of a generic system property at some higher level of structural organization [ 20 , 22 ] . The generic properties that these SGMs share are that each is composed of elements that are discrete , numerous , aggre - gated with one another via weak attractive interactions , and arrayed in a geometry that is structurally disordered and metastable . Glassy behavior in such systems is a conse - quence of structural relaxation in which the elements have to cross energy barriers that are large compared with ther - mal energies . A disordered metastable conﬁguration arises if the elements are quenched before they can attain a mini - mum energy ( equilibrium ) state . Sollich [ 20 ] extended the earlier work of Bouchaud [ 23 ] to develop a uniﬁed theory of soft glassy rheology ( SGR ) . SGR theory considers that the individual elements of the matrix exist within an energy landscape containing many wells , or traps , formed by neighboring elements . These traps are of differing energy depth , and each is regarded as being so deep that the element is unable to escape the well by thermal ﬂuctuations . Instead , elements are imagined to be agitated and rearranged by their mutual interactions within the matrix [ 20 ] . A clear notion of the source of the agitation remains to be identiﬁed , but this agitation can be represented nonetheless by an effective temperature , or noise level , x . The elements are unable to escape their wells when x (cid:1) 1 , in which case the system is perfectly elastic . When x . 1 , however , the elements can hop ran - domly between wells and , as a result , the system can ﬂow and become disordered . Flow and disorder are the essential features of a glassy material . Thus , as x approaches unity from above , the system approaches a glass transition . In the limit of linear responses at low frequencies , SGR theory [ 20 ] leads to a constitutive equation that we now identify as being identical to the structural damping law [ Eq . ( 1 ) ] . Accordingly , SGR theory provides the following inter - pretation of the free parameter x and the master curves reported here ( Fig . 3 ) . Agents that activate the contractile apparatus and / or polymerize cytoskeletal proteins move the cell towards a glass transition . A decreasing noise temperature is consistent with the formation of structure , which in turn may be associated with the notion of de Gennes [ 24 ] that chemical bonding is equivalent to attractive interactions ; the system becomes more ordered and approaches a frozen state . Conversely , relaxing 148102 - 3 148102 - 3 V OLUME 87 , N UMBER 14 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 1 O CTOBER 2001 agonists and agents that disrupt the cytoskeleton cause the system to become more disordered and move towards a ﬂuid state . SGR theory also identiﬁes the parameter G 0 in Eq . ( 1 ) as being the stiffness at the glass transition , and the parameter F 0 as being the frequency at which elements attempt to escape their energy wells . If so , then G 0 represents an upper limit of stiffness and might correspond to the stiffness deﬁned by the purely elastic cytoskeletal model of Satcher and Dewey [ 25 ] . Time - scale invariance . —The attempt rate F 0 is not to be confused with the frequency at which elements escape their energy wells , and does not correspond to a relax - ation time scale [ 19 ] . Rather , the inverse Fourier trans - form of Eq . ( 1 ) predicts a wide range of relaxation time scales [ 13 , 15 ] , relaxing according to the power law t 1 2 x . Power - law behavior implies that the relaxation processes are not tied to any particular internal time scale . Regulation of cell mechanics . —Although glasslike be - havior has been reported for protein macromolecules [ 26 ] , we do not necessarily expect that SGR theory will apply to mechanical properties at the level of discrete molecu - lar interactions . Moreover , the data presented here were restricted to small amplitude deformations coupled to the cytoskeleton via integrins , and to a limited subset of cells and substrates . Nonetheless , these data lead to the prospect of a major conceptual simpliﬁcation . The observation of universal master relationships describing cell rheology supports the hypothesis that details of the molecular inter - actions are manifested largely through their effects on x . This behavior is reminiscent of statistical mechanics in sys - tems that have only a weak dependence of aggregate be - havior on the details of the molecular interactions . We speculate that some key functions of diverse cytoskeletal proteins , such as their inﬂuence on the ability of the cy - toskeleton to deform , ﬂow , and reorganize , may be un - derstood mainly through their ability to modulate x . We have no evidence , however , that x is a regulated vari - able . SGR theory cannot predict how much a given drug might change x , but it does predict the effects of any drug - induced change in x on cytoskeletal rheology . As a prac - tical matter , it provides a conceptual framework for assays of drug potency . The rheological behavior reported here stands in contrast with prevailing theories of cell mechanics , which hold that cell rheology arises from an interaction of distinct elas - tic and viscous components expressing a limited range of characteristic relaxation times . Except at frequencies in ex - cess of several tens of Hz , the data reported here support the hypothesis that the locus of both the frictional and the elastic stresses is within formed structures of the cytoskele - ton [ 9 , 17 , 20 ] , and that the dominant frictional stress does not correspond to a viscous stress . To the extent that the concept of the sol - gel transition can be applied usefully to the mechanics of these formed cytoskeletal structures , the data presented here suggest that the gel phase may be thought of more properly as a glassy material existing close to a glass transition ; if so , then disorder and metastability may be essential features un - derlying mechanical functions of the cytoskeleton . A key thermodynamic distinction between the sol - gel transition ( in a strong gel ) and the glass transition is that the former is an equilibrium process , with structural elements found at energy minima , whereas the latter is a nonequilibrium pro - cess with elements trapped in metastable states . Finally , we wish to point out that it is unclear at this time how the level of metastability and intracellular agitation as ex - pressed by the effective noise temperature might depend upon how far the cell departs from thermodynamic equi - librium due to its energy metabolism , but this would seem to be an important question .
