The fission yeast endocytic protein End4 ( homologous to Sla2 in budding yeast and HIP1R in human ) contains a N - terminal domain that binds to PIP2 on the membrane , and a C - terminal THATCH domain that is postulated to be a binding partner of F - actin in vivo . Purified THATCH domain of the budding yeast Sla2 , however , shows low affinity to F - actin in vitro . We tested if isolated THATCH domain still has low affinity to F - actin in vivo , using TEV protease ( TEVp ) - mediated protein cleaving to separate the THATCH domain from the rest of End4 . Our results indicate that the isolated THATCH domain of End4 is unable to bind F - actin independently in vivo , consistent with the low affinity of the THATCH domain to F - actin measured from in vitro binding assays . 1 / 6 / 2022 - Open Access Figure 1 . Localization of proteins in fission yeast before and after TEVp cleavage in vivo : A : mEGFP was tagged to the C - terminus of Acp1 with a seven amino acid linker ( RIPGLIN ) . Most of the mEGFP signal is located at endocytic patches . B : mEGFP was tagged to the C - terminus of Acp1 with a TEVp recognition peptide ( ENLYFQS ) . The mEGFP signal is localized mostly at endocytic patches similar to wild type in ( A ) . C - D : mEGFP was tagged to the C - terminus of Acp1 with a TEVp recognition peptide , and the expression of TEVp was either inhibited ( C ) or induced ( D ) . The expression of TEVp reduced the brightness of the mEGFP signal at endocytic patches in ( D ) , suggesting successful cleavage of the mEGFP tag . E - F : mEGFP was tagged to the C - terminus of Acp1 with a mutated TEVp recognition peptide that cannot be cleaved ( ENLYF A S ) , and the expression of TEVp was either inhibited ( E ) or induced ( F ) . G : End4 was tagged at the N - terminus with mScarlet - I , and at the C - terminus with mEGFP . mScarlet - I ( left panel ) and mEGFP ( right panel ) signals co - localize at endocytic patches . H - I : End4 was tagged at the N - terminus with mScarlet - I , and at the C - terminus with mEGFP . A TEVp recognition peptide was inserted before the THATCH domain , and the expression of TEVp was either inhibited ( H ) or induced ( I ) . After TEVp cleavage in ( I ) , the THATCH domain of End4 is diffusive in the cytoplasm and the nucleus . Description End4 is an endocytic protein that mediates the connection between the lipid membrane and the actin cytoskeleton in fission yeast ( Gottfried , Ehrlich , and Ashery 2010 , 4 ; Iwaki et al . 2004 , 4 ; Lacy et al . 2018 , 4 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . 2001 ; 1 / 6 / 2022 - Open Access Skruzny et al . 2012 ) . The N - terminus of End4 binds to PIP2 on the membrane together with Ent1p , and the C - terminus of End4 shares sequence similarities to the actin binding domain of talin , and is therefore named THATCH ( t alin - H IP1 / R / Sla2p a ctin - t ethering C - terminal h omology ) ( Legendre - Guillemin 2004 , 4 ; Baggett , D’Aquino , and Wendland 2003 , 4 ; McCann and Craig 1997 ; Brett et al . 2006 ) . The crystal structures of THATCH domains from HIP1R and talin are five - helix - bundles ( Brett et al . 2006 ; Gingras et al . 2008 ) . The THATCH domain of Sla2 is critical for linking F - actin to the endocytic coat during CME in budding yeast ( Baggett , D’Aquino , and Wendland 2003 , 2 ; Brett et al . 2006 ; Abella et al . 2021 ) . The affinity of purified THATCH domains for actin filaments has been measured in vitro by multiple groups ( Brett et al . 2006 ; Gingras et al . 2008 ; Senetar , Foster , and McCann 2004 ) . Although structurally similar , the THATCH domain from HIP1R has the lowest affinity to actin among all tested THATCH domains , in some cases not significantly higher than that of the negative control with purified GST ( Senetar , Foster , and McCann 2004 ) . This discrepancy in the actin - binding ability of the THATCH domain from in vitro and in vivo data could be explained by cryptic actin - binding sites that are activated in vivo , by a ) post - translational modifications , b ) the binding of other molecules , or c ) force transmitted through the rest of the End4 molecule . All three binding site activation mechanisms have been found on talin , the molecule responsible for connecting the membrane to F - actin during cell adhesion through its 13 rod domains including the THATCH domain ( Goult , Yan , and Schwartz 2018 ; Goult , Brown , and Schwartz 2021 ) . A clear way to distinguish mechanism c ) from a ) and b ) is through in vivo protein cleaving . By isolating the THATCH domain of End4 from the rest of End4 in the cytoplasm of the fission yeast , the native environment for possible post - translational modifications or binding partners of THATCH are preserved , but force transmission to the THATCH domain is prevented . Consequently , the cellular localization of the isolated THATCH domain is indicative of its direct affinity to F - actin in vivo . We chose to use TEVp to perform in vivo protein cleaving , because TEVp has good specificity and only needs seven amino acids as the recognition sequence ( Sanchez and Ting 2020 ) . TEVp has been shown to work in diverse situations both in vivo and in vitro ( Harder et al . 2008 ; Raran - Kurussi et al . 2017 ) . The coding sequence of TEVp was integrated into the genome of fission yeast by CRISPR / Cas9 ( Fernandez and Berro 2016 ) , and put under the control of the inducible promoter nmt1 ( Forsburg 1993 ) . We first verified that our approach for in vivo protein cleaving worked and did not have undesirable effects , by using TEVp to separate the mEGFP tag from a control protein . We used the Acp1 subunit of the canonical actin filament capping protein , which localizes to endocytic sites ( Sun et al . 2019 ; Nakano and Mabuchi 2006 ; Berro and Pollard 2014 ) and has comparable cytoplasmic concentration to End4 in the fission yeast ( Sirotkin et al . 2010 ) . When Acp1 was tagged either with a regular linker or the TEVp recognition peptide , the majority of the mEGFP signal was detected at endocytic patches , which were enriched at the poles and the division plane of the fission yeast cells ( Fig . 1A - C ) . These endocytic patches contained a large amount of F - actin ( Lacy et al . 2018 ) . When the expression of TEVp was induced , we saw a drastic decrease of mEGFP signal from endocytic patches , suggesting the removal of the mEGFP tag from Acp1 molecules ( Fig . 1D ) . As expected , the cleavage of TEVp demonstrated good specificity , and a point mutation in the TEVp recognition peptide prevented protein cleaving ( Fig . 1E , 1F ) . We then inserted the TEVp recognition peptide prior to the THATCH domain of End4 . In wild - type cells , End4 localizes to endocytic patches in a pattern similar to Acp1 ( Fig . 1G ) . The insertion of the TEVp recognition peptide did not change the localization of End4 when TEVp was not expressed ( Fig . 1H ) . When TEVp was expressed , however , the THATCH domain was no longer found at endocytic patches but became diffusive in the cytoplasm and the nucleus , while the N - terminal fragment of End4 still showed polarized localization ( Fig . 1I ) . Failure of the isolated THACTH domain to localize to endocytic patches demonstrates that the affinity of the THATCH domain to F - actin is low in vivo , similarly to what was shown in vitro . In addition , our results demonstrate that the connection between the THATCH domain and the rest of the End4 molecule is necessary for its binding to actin filaments . We speculate that force transmission through the whole End4 protein is probably involved in exposing the cryptic F - actin binding sites . Methods Request a detailed protocol Yeast strains and media The S . pombe strains used in this study were made though CRISPR / Cas9 mediated genome editing as reported in ( Fernandez and Berro 2016 ) , and the edited gene sequences were confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing . The coding sequence of TEVp was inserted into the low complex region 0 . 5kb upstream of pil1 locus ( chromosome III , insertion after 348203 ) ( V . Wood et al . 2002 ; Valerie Wood et al . 2012 ) , under the control of the full strength nmt1 promoter ( Forsburg 1993 ) . S . pombe cells were cultured in YE5S ( Yeast Extract supplemented with 0 . 225 g / L of uracil , lysine , histidine , adenine and leucine ) , and imaged in EMM5S ( Edinburgh Minimum media supplemented with 0 . 225 g / L of uracil , histidine , adenine , lysine , and leucine ) after washing with EMM5S . Yeast cells were cultured at 32 °C with 200rpm shaking overnight to reach OD 595nm reading between 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 . The expression of TEVp was inhibited when yeast cells were cultured in YE5S media . The expression of 1 / 6 / 2022 - Open Access TEVp was induced by transferring yeast cells into EMM5S media after multiple washes , and cells were imaged after overnight culture in EMM5S to allow for enough time for TEVp mediated protein cleavage . Microscopy Cells were imaged at room temperature on gelatin pads ( 25 % ) on glass slides . Samples were mounted on a Nikon TiE inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) with a CSU - W1 Confocal Scanning Unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) with a CFI Plan Apo 100X / 1 . 45NA Phase objective ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Images were captured with an iXon Ultra888 EMCCD camera ( Andor , Belfast , UK ) . mEGFP tagged strains were excited with a 488 - nm argon - ion laser and filtered with a single band pass filter 510 / 25 . mScarlet - I tagged strains were excited with a 561 - nm argon - ion laser and filtered with a single band pass filter 575 / 25 . Fluorescent signals from the whole cell were collected by taking 21 optical sections each with 0 . 5µm thickness , and 2D maximum projected images were created for each strain by the Fiji distribution of ImageJ ( Schindelin et al . 2012 ) . All Acp1 strains were imaged and displayed with the same settings . For End4 strains , the mEGFP channel was imaged and displayed with the same settings , and the mScarlet - I channel was imaged and displayed with the same settings .
