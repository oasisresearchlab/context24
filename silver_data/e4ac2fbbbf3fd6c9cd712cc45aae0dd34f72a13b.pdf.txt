brief communications nature methods | VOL . 12 NO . 3 | MARCH 2015 | 199 Here we introduce RT - DC , in which on - the - fly analysis of deformed cell shape enables continuous measurement and the total number of cells analyzed is , in principle , unlimited . In contrast to DC—in which cells are deformed by inertial forces—with RT - DC , cells are flowed through a microfluidic channel constriction and deformed without contact by shear stresses and pressure gradients ( Fig . 1 ) . This aspect is similar to previous studies of red blood cell ( RBC ) deformability in microfluidic channels 10 – 12 . RBCs are rela - tively soft and can be deformed at low flow velocities . However , the analysis of shear stress – induced deformation for stiffer cells has not been demonstrated as it requires higher stresses , and thus higher velocities , which introduce considerable technical and methodical demands . RT - DC achieves this by the following innovations in experimental design , data acquisition and analysis . The deformed cell inside the constriction is illuminated with a pulsed , high - power LED and imaged with a complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) camera at 2 , 000 – 4 , 000 f . p . s . ( Fig . 1a and Online Methods ) . The camera - triggered LED light pulses are 1 µ s in duration—short enough to prevent motion blurring of the cells , which flow with ~ 10 cm / s and deform from a spheri - cal into a bullet - like shape ( Fig . 1b ) . CMOS cameras have been used before for the fast imaging of RBC deformations 13 , but the images acquired were analyzed off - line only . Here we applied an image analysis algorithm ( Online Methods ) , executed on a stand - ard personal computer , that continuously acquires images from the camera in real time , detects the presence of a cell , determines its contour ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , quantifies its deformation ( D = 1 − circularity ) and size ( cross - sectional area ) and displays the results in a scatter plot ( Fig . 1c and Online Methods ) . This feat enables the continuous analysis of cell deformation in real time with measurement rates of several hundreds of cells per second ( see Supplementary Video 1 ) and > 100 , 000 cells ( for RBCs as well as other cell types ) analyzed in a single experimental run . The cell deformation D inside the constriction is not inde - pendent of cell size , as larger cells experience greater stresses and deform more . We have developed a hydrodynamic model ( Online Methods ) that calculates the tangential ( shear ) and nor - mal stresses ( pressure ) over a spherical cell’s surface ( Fig . 1d ) and can be used to derive the expected deformations of an isotropic , linearly elastic sphere ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . The resulting shapes for Young’s moduli on the order of 1 kPa resemble those of the bullet - shaped cells in the experiment . This analytical mode - ling , not feasible for methods relying on inertial forces , effectively decouples size and deformation , and it permits the introduction of isoelasticity lines as additional parameterization of the scatter plots ( Fig . 1e ) and the extraction of material properties . real - time deformability cytometry : on - the - fly cell mechanical phenotyping Oliver Otto 1 , Philipp Rosendahl 1 , Alexander Mietke 1 , Stefan Golfier 1 , Christoph Herold 1 , Daniel Klaue 1 , Salvatore Girardo 1 , Stefano Pagliara 2 , Andrew Ekpenyong 1 , 3 , Angela Jacobi 1 , Manja Wobus 4 , Nicole Töpfner 5 , Ulrich F Keyser 2 , Jörg Mansfeld 1 , Elisabeth Fischer - Friedrich 6 , 7 & Jochen Guck 1 , 2 We introduce real - time deformability cytometry ( rt - dc ) for continuous cell mechanical characterization of large populations ( > 100 , 000 cells ) with analysis rates greater than 100 cells / s . rt - dc is sensitive to cytoskeletal alterations and can distinguish cell - cycle phases , track stem cell differentiation into distinct lineages and identify cell populations in whole blood by their mechanical fingerprints . this technique adds a new marker - free dimension to flow cytometry with diverse applications in biology , biotechnology and medicine . Mechanical phenotyping has long been discussed as a marker - free way of quantifying functional changes of physiological and pathological origin in cells 1 . This idea has been validated in the context of cell differentiation 2 – 4 and malignant transforma - tion 5 – 7 and has spawned the development of many basic research methods 8 . These techniques generally have throughput rates of 10 – 100 cells / h , which is far too low for applications in biology , biotechnology and medicine , for which a throughput comparable to that of standard flow cytometers is required . One important hydrodynamic approach starting to address this need is deformability cytometry ( DC ) 9 , in which cells are deformed by deceleration at the stagnation point of fast exten - sional flow . The ensuing deformation is imaged for a few seconds with a high - speed camera at 100 , 000 frames / s ( f . p . s . ) . Owing to the massive amount of data generated , the analysis has to be per - formed off - line , and results are available only after ~ 15 min . Using DC , Tse et al . were able to demonstrate the translational utility of mechanical phenotyping for the diagnostic analysis of pleural effusions 7 . DC enables measurement rates of ~ 1 , 000 cells / s , com - parable to that of fluorescence - based flow cytometers , but the total number of cells analyzed is limited to a few thousand . 1 Biotechnology Center , Technische Universität Dresden , Dresden , Germany . 2 Cavendish Laboratory , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK . 3 Department of Physics , Creighton University , Omaha , Nebraska , USA . 4 Medizinische Klinik 1 , Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus , Technische Universität Dresden , Dresden , Germany . 5 Klinik und Poliklinik für Kinder und Jugendmedizin , Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus , Technische Universität Dresden , Dresden , Germany . 6 Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems , Dresden , Germany . 7 Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden , Germany .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 200 | VOL . 12 NO . 3 | MARCH 2015 | nature methods brief communications As a first demonstration of the utility of RT - DC , we obtained dose - response curves of cytoskeletal drugs on cell deformability ( Online Methods and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Deformation of HL60 cells increased with increasing concentrations of cyto - chalasin D , a drug effectively disassembling filamentous actin ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Although sensitivity to drugs affecting intermediate filaments has been reported for a variant of DC 14 , the actin sensitivity ( and microtubule sensitivity ; data not shown ) connects RT - DC to cytoskeletal research on the progression through the cell cycle 15 – 18 . Thus , we tested whether RT - DC can distinguish cells chemically synchronized in different cell - cycle stages . Characteristic changes in size , deformation and overlap with isoelasticity bands were seen ( Fig . 2b ) . The ability to distinguish G2 - from M - phase cells , at least in part caused by changes in the actin cytoskeleton ( Supplementary Fig . 4b – d ) , is notable because this discrimination has not been demonstrated with DC and is impossible with FACS . Because cell size—assessed by forward scattering—remains approximately the same , and the amount of DNA—measured using propidium iodide ( PI ) , BrdU ( 5 - bromodeoxyuridine ) or EdU ( 5 - ethynyldeoxyuridine ) fluorescence—is identical , G2 and M cells cannot be resolved by FACS ( Fig . 2c ) . In contrast , the overlap of G2 and M phase decreases considerably in RT - DC – measured deformation distributions , and distinction becomes possible ( Fig . 2d ) . Thus , RT - DC is ideally suited for applications in which the analysis of cell - cycle progression and cell proliferation in living cells and without external labels is desired . Another physiological process that has been implicated in stiffness changes is the differentiation of cells . We differentiated HL60 cells into granulocytes , monocytes and macrophages and compared their mechanical fingerprints using RT - DC ( Fig . 3a ) . Granulocytes and monocytes were more deformable than undif - ferentiated HL60 cells , whereas macrophages were stiffer—a finding consistent with previous optical stretcher results 4 . We further differentiated primary human hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ; CD34 + cells ) from bone marrow ( BM - CD34 + ) in vitro into the same three mature myeloid cell types , which showed the same mechanical difference between granulocytes / monocytes and macrophages ( Fig . 3b ) , a distinction not easily made with FACS ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Comparing HL60 cells directly to primary HSCs showed considerable differences in size and deformation ( Fig . 3c ) . This was expected because HL60 cells are immortal and differ from their primary counterparts in several aspects , and even mechanical differences have been previously seen by optical stretching 4 . Particularly interesting is the difference between CD34 + cells from bone marrow ( BM - CD34 + ) and peripheral blood ( PB - CD34 + ) despite their being identified by the same molecular surface marker . PB - CD34 + cells constitute a rather homogeneous population mobilized into the peripheral blood after administration of recombinant granulocyte High - power LED 40 × 0 . 75 Objective Cell 1 ms 0 . 15 0 . 02 0 . 01 0 40 80 120 9 E 0 6 . 3 E 0 5 E 0 3 . 7 E 0 3 E 0 2 . 3 E 0 1 . 7 E 0 E 0 Max Min 0 . 10 0 . 05 D e f o r m a t i on D e f o r m a t i on Cell size ( µ m 2 ) Cell size ( µ m 2 ) 50 100 150 n = 4 , 195 2 ms 3 ms 4 ms Shear stress Pressure 1 . 3 2 . 3 – 2 . 3 0 . 5 0 – 0 . 5 ( kPa ) ( kPa ) CMOS camera Syringe a b c e d Outlet figure 1 | Real - time deformability cytometry ( RT - DC ) .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature methods | VOL . 12 NO . 3 | MARCH 2015 | 201 brief communications colony – stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) . In contrast , BM - CD34 + cells are more heterogeneous , containing cells in G2 and M phases and from a continuous spectrum of differentiation , which are absent in PB - CD34 + cells . This difference is not detectable with FACS based on size or CD34 + expression levels . Arguably the biggest appeal of mechanical phenotyping lies in the label - free identification of different , and especially less fre - quent , cells in a mixed population ; for example , the cell types present in whole blood . Here the real - time analysis , enabling con - tinuous measurement , becomes essential . It allowed us to assess ~ 40 , 000 blood cells in 85 s ( Fig . 3d ) . The very abundant RBCs were clearly separated from the other cells by their greater deformation , revealing at least three additional cell populations . This shift of the RBCs away from the other blood cell types is a distinct advantage of RT - DC over label - free FACS analysis ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Separate analysis identified the remaining populations as platelets , peripheral blood mononucleated cells and granulocytes ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – d ) . The stimulation of granulocytes with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) resulted in a clear change in their mechanical fingerprint ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) , which , together with the small interdonor variability ( Supplementary Fig . 7f , g ) , points to future diagnostic applications of RT - DC . Cytomechanical analysis of human blood could become a func - tional correlate to the blood smear routinely performed in human medicine . It would add a dynamic dimension of cell function to the currently static analysis of cell morphology . Future addition of multiwavelength fluorescence analysis is straightforward and will enable cross - correlation of mechanics with standard cyto - logical markers used in FACS . Real - time analysis also opens the possibility for active sorting based on mechanical properties and fluorescence in Bayesian combination , setting RT - DC apart from passive mechanical sorting approaches in which sorting is fixed by microfluidic channel geometry and optimized for a particular deformability , size and flow speed 19 , 20 . RT - DC has the poten - tial to find widespread application in diverse fields of biology , biotechnology and medicine , where a label - free characterization of cell function is a desired and so far unmet need . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

The experimental setup for real - time and high - throughput mechanical cell analysis ( Fig . 1 ) consists of the following features . The microfluidic chip is made of poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) ( PDMS ; Sylgard 184 , VWR ) using stand - ard soft - lithography methods . After cross - linking the polymer for 45 min at 70 °C and opening inlet and outlet with a 1 . 5 - mm biopsy puncher ( Harris Unicore , Sigma - Aldrich ) , the bottom of the chip is sealed with a glass cover slide ( Thickness 2 , Hecht ) after plasma surface activation ( PDC 32 - G , Harrick ) of the PDMS . The microfluidic chip has two reservoirs connected by a 300 - µ m - long narrow channel ( constriction ) with a 20 µ m × 20 µ m or 30 µ m × 30 µ m square cross - section depending on maximum cell size . Cell size should be between 50 % and 90 % of the channel size so that shear gradients are large . Clogging by cell clumps and debris occurs in about 10 % of the chips ; this could be further reduced by introduction of a row of filter posts . After fabrication , the chip is assembled on the xy stage of an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) and connected to a syringe pump ( NemeSyS , Cetoni ) for driving a cell suspension through the channel ( Fig . 1a inset ) . In all experiments a flow rate between 0 . 02 µ l / s and 0 . 2 µ l / s is applied . A sheath flow geometry centers the cells laterally , and lift forces center them vertically within the channel , so that they are always in focus . For a given flow rate and channel cross - section , the velocity of a cell depends on its size . The velocity vs . cell - size distribution is measured experimentally and can be described theoretically ( see analytical model below ) . For a flow rate of 0 . 04 µ l / s and a cell diameter of 15 µ m , the final cell velocity inside a 20 µ m × 20 µ m channel is approximately 15 cm / s . In order to reduce motion blurring of cells during translocation through the constriction , a high - power LED ( CBT - 120 , 462 nm , Luminus Devices ) is operated with a pulsed current for sample illumination . Pulses are triggered by the camera shutter to ensure synchronized image exposure . When the LED is operated at a pulse duration of 1 µ s and a cell velocity of 15 cm / s , motion blur - ring is reduced to about 0 . 15 µ m . This is sufficient to reliably characterize the deformation of cells . Images of deformed cells are acquired using a CMOS camera ( MC1362 , Mikrotron ) , which is connected to a standard PC via full camera link interface ( NI - 1433 Frame Grabber , National Instruments ) . At full resolution this camera can operate at more than 500 frames per second ( f . p . s . ) . For a reduced region of interest ( ROI ) , acquisition rates of up to 100 , 000 f . p . s . can be achieved . In the experiments described , the camera is typically run at 4 , 000 f . p . s . with an ROI of 250 × 80 pixels . All image processing steps are carried out using a standard six - core PC . At the moment , the algorithm is capable of performing image acquisition , image analysis and data storage for several hundred cells per second in real time . In practice , the ability for real - time analysis is limited only by the number of cells available . In compliance with Nature Methods ’ material - sharing policy , the setup is available for running reasonable and limited , non - commercial trial experiments at the Biotechnology Center of the Technische Universität Dresden , Dresden , Germany , at the user’s expense and subject to signing a license agreement . Image analysis . The image processing algorithm is imple - mented in a C + + / LabVIEW environment . Although LabVIEW ( LabVIEW 2012 , National Instruments ) is used as a user interface , all time - critical calculations are carried out as C + + code using the OpenCV computer vision library ( http : / / opencv . org ) com - piled into dynamic link libraries running on three dedicated CPU cores . Communication between different threads is achieved by queues . In the current implementation of the software the com - plete processing time of a single frame is less than 250 µ s . In practice , the first core acquires a single frame from the cam - era . The image is assigned a unique handle ID and transferred to a second core responsible for image preprocessing . These tasks include background subtraction and thresholding to create a binary image . Next , on a third core , the presence of a cell in the image is detected , and the contour of the cell , if present , is deter - mined using a border - following algorithm 21 . From the contour the algorithm derives the cell cross - sectional area , perimeter and position and calculates the circularity c , which is the main quantity used to characterize the deformation of cells . Here the circularity is defined as c A l = 2 p where A is the projected cell surface area and l is its perimeter . Obviously , for an ideal circle , c = 1 ; and for any deformation , c < 1 . The deformation of a cell is defined as D = 1 − c , as this quantity increases with deformation away from a round shape . Because the measurement output is a text file of shape informa - tion , and there is no need to save images or videos , the typical data size of an experiment with 10 , 000 cells measured is on the order of 1 MB . Analytical model . The analytical model developed in this work allows the calculation of the flow profile around a spherical object moving in a cylindrical microfluidic channel . It derives the hydrodynamic stresses on the object surface and quantifies its deformation on the basis of linear - elasticity theory . Applying this analytical model to RT - DC data , the relationship between cell size – dependent stress , deformation and elastic material parame - ters is disentangled ( A . M . , O . O . , S . Girardo , P . R . , A . Taubenberger , et al . ; unpublished data ) . The main steps are outlined below . RT - DC operates at Reynolds numbers below 0 . 1 , which allows neglecting the inertial terms in the Navier - Stokes equation . The hydrodynamic stresses applied with the RT - DC setup are calcu - lated in two steps . First , a closed solution to the Stokes equation for a sphere advected in a cylindrical channel 22 is employed to extract steady - state flow profiles , velocities of the sphere and sphere size – dependent surface stresses . In the second step , the concept of the equivalent channel radius 23 is used to map the results to the square cross - section geometry in the RT - DC setup . The force acting on the sphere is characterized by two counteract - ing contributions ( Fig . 1d ) : a net force due to the normal pressure distribution over the sphere , which acts mostly in the direction of the flow ( F p > 0 ) and pushes and pulls at the rear and front side of the cell , respectively ; and a net viscous shear force from the shear stresses acting particularly at cell surface regions that are closest to the channel walls , which holds the cell back ( F s < 0 ) . Although cells are moving without net force in steady state ( F p + F s = 0 ) , the anisotropy of the surface stresses leads to the observed bullet - like deformations ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3281 nature methods normal stresses , and hence deformations , depend on the cell size relative to the channel dimensions . To disentangle the relation between cell size – dependent hydro - dynamic stress and resulting deformations , we employ an analytical model that calculates deformations of an elastic sphere under the hydrodynamic load present in the RT - DC setup . Briefly , we use an analytical solution for the equilibrium equation of an isotropic , incompressible , linearly elastic medium , which contains free constants that have to be adapted to appropriate boundary con - ditions 24 . The form of this general deformation solution and the hydrodynamic stress permit the derivation of the resulting defor - mations analytically by using the latter as boundary conditions for the deformation problem . In the deformation vs . area scatter - plot representation , a cell population that varies only in size but is homogeneous in its elastic properties would cover a path that is approximated by isoelasticity lines derived from the analytical model ( Fig . 1e ) . Calculation of those isoelasticity lines is done by fixing the elastic modulus in the model and increasing the sphere radius while leaving all experimental parameters constant . Eventually area and deformation are derived from the result - ing theoretical shapes . The model is also capable of extracting elastic parameters by shape - fitting of the experimentally observed cell shapes ( A . M . , O . O . , S . Girardo , P . R . , A . Taubenberger , et al . , unpublished data ) . Note that the observed cross - sectional area of a deformed cell is not necessarily equal to the cross - sectional area of the non - deformed cell . Hence , it is possible that two cells with identical elastic moduli but different cell volumes have very similar cross - sectional areas in their deformed state but differ in the measured deformation . According to our model , this effect is particularly prominent for the case of large deformations where isoelasticity lines become increasingly steep in size - deformation plots ( see Fig . 2b ) . To apply comparable stresses in microfluidic channels of differ - ent dimensions ( for example , side length L and L ′ of two different cross - sectional channel areas ) , the flow rate has to be changed by a factor of ( L ′ / L ) 3 , which follows from simple scaling arguments . RT - DC measurement procedure . Cells in suspension are cen - trifuged at 115 g for 5 min ( 5805 R , Eppendorf ) and resuspended in a solution of phosphate saline buffer without Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ( PBS− ) and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to a final concentration of 10 6 cells / ml . Usually an absolute sample volume of 100 µ l is sufficient for RT - DC studies . Addition of methyl - cellulose increases the density of the buffer and helps to reduce sedimentation of the cells during the experiment . Methylcellulose also increases the viscosity of the medium and thus allows higher shear forces at lower flow velocities . It has been shown that meth - ylcellulose can be used as a component of cell culture media 25 without biological alterations to the cells 26 . The cell suspension is kept at 37 °C before being drawn into a 1 - ml syringe . The syringe is connected to the chip by polymer tub - ing , which is extensively cleaned by flushing with ethanol ( 70 % ) and 200 nm – sterile - filtered ( Millipore , Sigma - Aldrich ) deion - ized water . After sample loading and connecting the tubing to the inlet and outlet of the chip , the flow is usually stabilized for 2 min at a constant flow rate before starting the measurement . All data acquisition is carried out at the rear part of the 300 - µ m - long constriction where the cell shape has reached steady state . In a typical experiment , between 1 , 000 and 100 , 000 cells are analyzed , depending on the sample concentration and the requirements of the particular experiment , at three different flow rates . After each condition the flow is stabilized for 2 min . As a reference , the circularity of the nondeformed cells in the reservoir is con - firmed for all experiments ( see Supplementary Fig . 8 for three typical examples ) . Cells . HL60 cells . Most of the experiments were done on HL60 cells , a myeloid precursor cell line , which has served as a standard suspended cell line in comparable experiments with an optical stretcher 4 . Where appropriate , results were confirmed with pri - mary cells . The HL60 cell line was originally derived from a patient suffering from APL in 1977 and modified to the current HL60 / S4 line ( a generous gift from D . and A . Olins of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , College of Pharmacy , University of New England , who had confirmed the cell line before sending ) used in this work 27 . Cells were cultured in RPMI - 1640 medium ( Life Technologies ) with 10 % FCS ( Life Technologies ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) in a standard incuba - tor ( Hera Cell , Thermo Scientific ) at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air . The cells were split every 48 h and resuspended to a concentra - tion of 2 × 10 5 cells / ml . For experiments , cells were taken during log phase , approximately 36 h after splitting . Cells were initially checked for mycoplasma contamination ( Mycoplasma Kit , Sigma - Aldrich ) and regularly renewed from frozen stocks . HL60 - gran , HL60 - mono and HL60 - mac . As a myeloid precursor cell line , in vitro differentiation of HL60 cells into granulocyte - like , monocyte - like and macrophage - like cells can be induced , which have many properties resembling those of primary cells . The differentiation protocol is as follows 4 . Briefly , for generating HL60 - derived granulocytes ( HL60 - gran ) all - trans – retinoic acid ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with a final concentration of 1 µ M was added to a T - 25 cell culture flask . The concentration of cells was kept at 1 . 5 × 10 5 cells / ml . HL60 - derived monocytes ( HL60 - mono ) were obtained using 1 - α , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 100 nM while cell concentration was kept constant at 1 . 5 × 10 5 cells / ml . HL60 - derived macrophage ( HL60 - mac ) differentia - tion was induced with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ; Sigma - Aldrich ) at 16 nM . Cell density was adjusted to 2 . 5 × 10 5 cells / ml . Successful differentiation required 96 h for neutrophils and monocytes and 24 h for macrophages and was tested by pro - liferation as well as fluorescence assays 4 . HSCs . CD34 + human hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) were obtained from granulocyte colony – stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) - mobilized peripheral blood ( PB - CD34 + ) or from bone marrow ( BM - CD34 + ) of healthy donors . With informed consent , following the Institutional Review Board - approved protocols EK221102004 and EK263122004 , we selected CD34 + cells from apheresis or bone marrow products by immunomagnetic selection using CD34 progenitor - cell isolation MicroBeads ( Miltenyi ) , following the instructions of the manufacturer . The purity of the CD34 + popu - lation after selection was determined to be > 97 % using FACS . All FACS measurements in this study were done with an LSR II flow cytometer ( BD Bioscience ) . HSC - gran , HSC - mono and HSC - mac . In vitro differentiation and expansion of primary HSCs was carried out for bone marrow – derived CD34 + cells over 21 d . For granulocyte differentiation 28 , BM - CD34 + cells were seeded in serum - free Cellgro medium n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3281 nature methods ( CellGenix ) and cultured for 21 d in the presence of the following cytokines . For the first 4 d , the medium contained recombinant human G - CSF ( 30 ng / ml ) , GM - CSF ( 5 ng / ml ) ( PeproTech ) , SCF ( 50 ng / ml ) , FLT3L ( 100 ng / ml ) and IL - 3 ( 5 ng / ml ) ( Miltenyi ) . At days 4 , 7 , 11 , 14 , 17 and 21 , cells were harvested , washed and either expanded ( day 4 : IL - 3 and G - CSF ; days 7 – 21 : G - CSF ) or directly used for analysis . For monocyte and macrophage dif - ferentiation , G - CSF was substituted by GM - CSF and M - CSF ( 30 ng / ml ) , respectively 29 . The surface expression of the stem cell marker CD34 and of lineage - specific markers ( granulocytes CD15 and CD66b ; monocytes and macrophages CD14 and CD11b ) was quantified after 21 d by FACS ( data not shown ) . Primary blood cells . The blood samples of healthy volunteers were drawn with a 20 - gauge Multifly needle into an S - Monovette ( either 9 ml EDTA or 10 ml sodium citrate ) by vacuum aspiration ( Sarstedt ) . The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universität Dresden ( EK89032013 ) . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study procedure . For whole blood measurements , the drawn blood was diluted 1 : 50 in PBS – containing 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose . For erythrocyte depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) , 2 . 5 ml Dextran 6 % ( w / v ) ( Dextran 500 , Pharmacosmos ) were added to 10 ml of whole blood and mixed by inverting four times . After sedimenta - tion of erythrocytes , the supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 260 g and cells were gently resuspended in PBS – containing 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose for RT - DC measurements . From a second blood sample of the same donor , granulocytes , PBMCs and erythrocytes ( Supplementary Fig . 7b – d ) were highly puri - fied by a two - gradient density centrifugation with 42 % and 51 % Percoll ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) . Granulocyte activation was induced by 60 ng PMA per 10 6 cells and an incubation for 30 min at 37 °C ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) . RT - DC measurements of primary blood cells were performed in channels with a cross - section of 20 µ m × 20 µ m at a flow rate of 0 . 04 µ l / s . Viability tests . For all cells used in this study , the viability after RT - DC measurement was tested . For HL60 cells , a discrimina - tion between apoptotic and necrotic cells was performed by an annexin V – FITC / PI FACS assay following a standard protocol ( Life Technologies ) , which assesses phosphatidylserine ( PS ) translocation together with membrane integrity . Control cells were taken from the same cell culture flask and treated the same way except for not carrying out the RT - DC measurement . FACS analysis revealed a cell viability post - RT - DC of 94 % ± 1 % com - pared to 97 % ± 1 % of the controls ( see Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . To study long - term effects , we monitored the rate of growth of post - RT - DC HL60 cells for 5 d and compared it to the growth of controls . Trypan blue ( Sigma - Aldrich ) staining was carried out 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 and 120 h after the experiment , and the number of viable cells was counted using a Neubauer chamber , revealing no significant differences in viability between post - RT - DC cells ( 97 % ) and controls ( 98 % ) . The viability of peripheral blood – and bone marrow – derived CD34 + cells was continuously monitored to over 95 % , analyzed with Trypan blue and annexin V / PI using microscopy and FACS , following the instructions of the manu - facturer ( Miltenyi ) . Drug treatments . To test the sensitivity of RT - DC to altera - tions in the cytoskeleton , we treated HL60 cells with different concentrations of cytochalasin D ( cytoD ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . CytoD is an inhibitor of actin polymerization and leads to a destabiliza - tion of the cell actin cortex . Prior to the experiment , cells were resuspended in PBS – and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose as described above and incubated with the respective concentration of cytoD for 10 min at 37 °C . This study was performed using 0 . 01 µ M , 0 . 1 µ M , 1 µ M and 10 µ M cytoD dissolved in 0 . 0025 % , 0 . 025 % , 0 . 25 % and 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , respectively . As DMSO ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used as a solvent , its effect on cell deformation was verified using RT - DC applying the same protocol . Up to a concentration of 1 % ( v / v ) DMSO , no significant change in relative deformation was observed ( Supplementary Fig . 2c inset ) . Statistical significance was determined by bootstrapping the deformation sample distributions and subsequent conduction of a paired t - test 30 for each concentration of cytoD . Here , the mean of the bootstrapping distribution for every drug treatment was tested against the null hypothesis that relative deformation equals unity . The effect of cytoD on HL60 cells for a given concentration is declared significant from the experimental repetition with the highest P value . The effect of cytoD concentration on relative deformation is described by fitting a sigmoidal dose - dependence model to the data , which allows for calculation of a unified median ( half - maximal ) dose C 50 . Cell - cycle synchronization . HL60 cells were presynchronized at the border of G1 / S by a standard double - thymidine block and release protocol . In brief , cells were treated for 20 h with thymi - dine ( 2 . 5 mM , Sigma - Aldrich ) followed by a release ( two wash - ing steps , each consisting of centrifugation at 180 g for 5 min and resuspension in PBS – ) into fresh medium for 9 h and a second 16 - h thymidine block . This procedure yields a highly synchro - nized population of HL60 cells with a fraction of more than 90 % in G1 / S as measured by cell - cycle analysis with a standard flow cytometer as described below . For S phase , presynchronized cells were released for 30 min . G2 cells were then additionally incu - bated with 9 µ M CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 ( VWR ) for further 5 h . Mitotic cells were obtained by releasing presynchronized cells into fresh medium containing 10 µ M dimethylenastron ( DMA ; VWR ) for 10 h . DMA is an analog of monastrol preventing centrosome separation , which results in monopolar spindle formation and a subsequent mitotic checkpoint – dependent arrest 31 . G1 - phase cells were produced by releasing cells after a double - thymidine block into clean medium . After 12 h , more than 90 % had under - gone mitosis and were in G1 as confirmed by flow cytometry measurements . Samples synchronized in G1 , S , G2 and mitosis were characterized in the RT - DC setup following the protocol described above . In parallel , the synchronized samples were fixed and stained for cell - cycle analysis using standard flow cytometry . Fixation was done with ice - cold absolute ethanol yielding a final concentra - tion of 80 % ( v / v ) . The fixed cells were washed and incubated for 40 min in a PBS – solution containing 5 µ g / ml PI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 µ g / ml RNase A ( Life Technologies ) and 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ( G - Bioscience ) . Fluorescence imaging and staining . Confocal images of cytoD - treated and cell - cycle phase – synchronized cells ( Supplementary Figs . 3 and 4b ) were obtained with an upright confocal laser n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3281 nature methods scanning microscope ( LSM 700 , Zeiss ) . Cells were kept in sus - pension at a concentration of about 10 6 cells / ml and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , incubated for 20 min and then washed with PBS – . Subsequently , 50 µ l of cell suspension were placed on a Superfrost Plus gold microscope slide ( Gerhard Menzel GmbH ) , whose surface binds sedimented cells . After per - meabilization with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( G - Bioscience ) for 5 min , the adhered cells were carefully rinsed four times using PBS – . This washing procedure was applied after each step of the protocol . Cells were then incubated in 50 µ l of a staining solu - tion containing 2 . 8 µ M 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; Life Technologies ) and 0 . 4 µ M phalloidin tetramethylrhodamine ( TRITC ; Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS – for 1 h in the dark . One drop of ProLong antifade ( Life Technologies ) was added , and the cells were sealed with a coverslip . 21 . Suzuki , S . & Abe , K . Comput . Vis . Graph .
