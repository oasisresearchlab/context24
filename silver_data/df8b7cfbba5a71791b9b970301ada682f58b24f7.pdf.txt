KEYWORDS : brand image ; consumer purchase decisions ; e - commerce ; fashion industry ; live streaming ; social media marketing ; Shopee ; Indonesia . INTRODUCTION Digitization has revolutionized business strategies , moving from traditional sales models to online e - commerce platforms . This shift isn ' t just beneficial for customers , but also crucial for businesses to rethink and redefine their marketing strategies . The evolution of technology has opened the global economy , intensifying competition , altering consumption patterns and consumer behaviors , and reshaping how companies communicate with their target groups . This transformation is rooted in the advancements in digital communication and analytics tools , which allow businesses to gain deeper insights into consumer preferences and tailor their offerings accordingly ( Bruhn et al . , 2012 ; Mutero , 2014 ; Siamagka et al . , 2015 ) . In 2018 , Indonesia saw a remarkable increase in internet users to 171 . 17 million from a population of 264 . 16 million , a significant rise from the previous year . This growth in digital connectivity played a pivotal role in fostering the country ' s e - commerce sector . The increasing level of internet penetration has provided an extra push for digital businesses , enabling them to reach a larger consumer base and serve more diverse market segments . The digital economy of Indonesia , particularly in the ASEAN region , has experienced rapid growth , with projections indicating a significant increase in economic value . This demonstrates the country ' s potential as a digital economic powerhouse ( APJII , 2019 , 2023 ; DailySocial . id , 2019 ; Google et al . , 2019 ) . Indonesia is a leader in e - commerce adoption within the APAC region , with a significant portion of 64 % of consumer spending being online in 2022 . This trend places Indonesia alongside major economies like India and only behind China . The rate of e - commerce penetration in Indonesia is above that of many developed countries , indicating the strength of the digital market that drives changes in consumer behavior and retail strategies , and highlights the huge potential for fashion SMEs . However , their hesitation or inability to utilize digital tools , particularly live shopping platform features , limits their growth in markets where online fashion shopping is becoming more popular . The widespread access to mobile internet has been a crucial factor in this rapid digitization , especially given Indonesia’s large population ( APJII , 2019 , 2023 ; DailySocial . id , 2019 ; Google et al . , 2019 ) . The direct correlation between internet accessibility and e - commerce penetration is obvious in Indonesia . As the number of people having internet access increases , the tendency to shop online also rises . In 2017 , just 27 % of the Indonesian population actively engaged in online shopping . However , in the year 2022 , the percentage increased to 65 % . This is why countries with high internet adoption rates also have high e - commerce adoption rates . The growth of eCommerce in Indonesia is faster compared to Germany and International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1949 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 the United States . The rising digital literacy among Indonesian citizens is a significant driver of this e - commerce growth , marking a shift in retail dynamics in the country ( Indonesia Investments Report , 2023 ; Uzunoglu , 2024 ) . A significant number of Indonesian consumers shop online regularly , indicating a shift towards habitual online purchasing . According to data from Rakuten Insight , 32 % of Indonesian consumers shop online several times a month . This is followed by 22 % who shop several times a week , and 17 % who shop once or twice a week or a month each ( Ecommercedb . com , 2022 ) . This change is triggered by factors such as wider internet access , a diverse range of online offerings ( products and services ) , and the convenience of digital shopping . The rapid growth of the e - commerce market in Indonesia is evidence of this trend . Global reports recognize Indonesia as a leading country in online purchases and e - commerce app usage , highlighting a significant transformation in shopping habits and positioning Indonesia prominently in the global digital economy ( Rakuten Insight , 2022 ; Uzunoglu , 2024 ) . Live shopping , merging live video broadcasting with online transactions , has revolutionized online retail in Indonesia . First gaining popularity in China in 2017 , this approach enables real - time interaction between sellers and customers , simulating an in - person shopping experience ( Fransiska & Paramita , 2020 ) . The COVID - 19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of live shopping in Indonesia , leading to a 91 % substantial increase in e - commerce transactions . The high engagement with live commerce services in Indonesia , 83 . 7 % of the Indonesian population , indicates its effectiveness as a marketing and sales tool , with features like replaying broadcasts , flash sales , real - time communication , high - quality video production , and secure payment methods , enhancing consumer experience ( Andika et al . , 2021 ; Halim et al . , 2022 ; Jakpat , 2022a ; J . Liu et al . , 2022 ; Putra et al . , 2020 ) . The utilization of live shopping platforms in Indonesia is extremely popular , with an increased rate of usage compared to the United States . A total of 57 % of the Indonesian population has utilized live shopping platforms . This trend positions Indonesia as a leader in live commerce in the Asia - Pacific region . The popularity of these platforms can be attributed to their interactive nature and the unique shopping experiences they offer , including influencer collaborations and special deals , which have set new standards in online retail . Overall , the rapid adoption of live shopping in Indonesia reflects a wider global e - commerce trend and highlights the country ' s capacity for digital innovation in the retail sector , which significantly impacts consumer behavior and expands market opportunities for businesses , especially for SMEs ( Snapcart , 2022 ) . Live shopping has a significant impact on consumer behavior in Indonesia , with platforms like Shopee dominating the market , As demonstrated by its ability to attract the attention of 83 . 7 % of the Indonesian population . Shopee’s success in live shopping is evidenced by its high viewer engagement and the significant increase in orders received by sellers post - live stream . This trend is reinforced by the extensive hours , 10 million hours , Indonesians spend on live broadcasts on e - commerce platforms , demonstrating the growing popularity of this shopping format ( Halim et al . , 2022 ; Jakpat , 2022b ; Snapcart , 2023 ) . Although previous research has extensively discussed e - commerce and live commerce , there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding how Indonesian fashion SMEs utilize and optimize factors such as perceived media richness , price fairness , electronic word of mouth ( eWOM ) , social media marketing , and brand image to enhance purchasing intentions and product sales through live commerce streaming . Particularly , how these factors synergize within the unique context of Indonesia , which is marked by cultural diversity and specific digital challenges , has not been deeply investigated . This study aims to fill this gap by providing empirical insights that will aid Indonesian fashion SMEs in addressing digital transition challenges and enhancing sales effectiveness through live commerce streaming . Shopee Live emerges as the preferred live streaming feature in Indonesia , favored for its attractive offers and memorable service . A survey conducted in May 2023 , that involved 506 individuals aged 17 - 45 , showed that Shopee Live is the most preferred live streaming feature in Indonesia , with 69 % of respondents favoring it over competitors such as TikTok Live ( 25 % ) , Tokopedia Play ( 4 % ) , and LazLive ( 2 % ) . The platform’s success is attributed to competitive prices , the attractive offers , an emphasis on free shipping ( 91 % ) , discounts ( 87 % ) , cashback ( 65 % ) , shopping vouchers ( 47 % ) , special bundles ( 34 % ) , and exclusive product launches ( 20 % ) are particularly popular among consumers , making it a potent marketing tool for live streaming features . Shopee’s significant reach and influence , especially in the fashion category , illustrate its effectiveness in capturing a broad audience at relatively low costs . There are many different kinds of video content available on the Shopee app , and one of the most popular categories is fashion items . This trend is also noticeable in Indonesia , where fashion - related content ranks third in the most viewed category . Therefore , many fashion businesses leverage the Shopee platform to carry out their activities . The role of Shopee in this research is crucial , with a focus on enhancing the sales of Indonesian fashion e - commerce through innovative live commerce streaming . As a selected platform , Shopee excels in assisting small fashion businesses to expand their digital presence and boost sales , thanks to the interactive features International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1950 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 of Shopee Live that have redefined the online shopping experience . This platform plays a crucial role due to its comprehensive understanding of shoppers ' preferences and its ability to deliver seamless and engaging online shopping experiences . Shopee , not just a marketplace , stands out as a pioneer in the online fashion industry , making it a perfect model for examining the effects of live streaming on improving fashion sales . Shopee significantly contributes to the growth of the online fashion industry and has a strong impact on customer buying decisions by utilizing revolutionary digital technologies and closely monitoring consumer trends ( Siallagan , 2023 ; Zhu & Vijayan , 2023 ) . Live streaming technology has penetrated various industries in Indonesia , including e - commerce , education , tourism , entertainment , gaming , and social media , enhancing operations and fostering real - time engagement ( Ma , 2022 ; Statista , 2023a , 2023b ) . Technology has allowed industries to reach a wider audience , create new opportunities for content creators and businesses , and adapt to changing consumer preferences . Interacting directly with customers through live streaming has proven to be a highly effective marketing strategy , resulting in increased sales and customer satisfaction ( L . Chen et al . , 2022a ) . In fields like tourism and education , live streaming has enabled virtual exploration and remote learning , breaking geographical barriers ( Dong et al . , 2023 ) . Similarly , in entertainment and gaming , it has created new forms of online consumption and community - building ( Statista , 2023b , 2023a ; Sun et al . , 2023 ) . Live streaming technology now enables event organizers and news agencies in Indonesia to broadcast real - time content , allowing remote audiences to experience events and journalism as they happen ( Casu & Belfiore , 2022 ; Sari , 2020 ; Writer , 2023 ) . The textile and clothing market in Indonesia , supported by the country’s significant population and economic growth , is a major contributor to the economy . The fashion industry , representing a significant share of Indonesia ' s creative economy with 18 . 01 % or Rp 116 trillion contributions , is influenced by factors like government regulations and wage policies . This industry has a significant impact on GDP and employment generation for Indonesia ' s economy . The rise in fashion entrepreneurs in Indonesia to over 1 . 06 million , fueled by the high demand for fashion products and improved internet access , has been particularly beneficial for SMEs ( CNBC Indonesia , 2019 ; Fiarani , 2020 ) . The Indonesian fashion industry is experiencing rapid growth , with a significant annual growth rate of more than 10 % from 2021 to 2025 projected . This growth leads to increased competition , with the fashion category representing a major part of Indonesia ' s e - commerce sector by generating around US $ 4 . 792 billion in revenue in 2019 . The strong demand for fashion items , which is in line with the expansion of new markets , contributes to this high revenue . The high demand for fashion items and the emergence of new markets are driving this growth , with a substantial portion of consumers preferring online purchases for fashion items ( Snapcart , 2022 , 2023 ) . SMEs are vital to Indonesia ' s economic growth , particularly in the dynamic fashion industry . The fashion sector’s contribution to the GDP and its large share in the creative economy highlight its importance . According to the Central Statistics Agency ( 2015 ) , the creative economy , which includes the fashion sector , contributed 7 . 1 % on average to Indonesia ' s GDP between 2010 and 2013 . Of this creative economy section , the fashion industry accounted for 27 . 93 % . This puts the creative economy as the seventh - largest contributor to the country ' s GDP . Globalization has introduced increased competition for SMEs , necessitating adaptation to market trends and digitalization . E - commerce offers SMEs opportunities to connect with global customers , overcoming traditional barriers and fostering business growth ( Abubakar et al . , 2010 ; Song et al . , 2021 ; Ye et al . , 2022 ) . According to a survey conducted in 2022 by Shopee and Katadata Insight Center , 58 % of Indonesian UKM had difficulties as a result of live streaming or live commerce . Indonesian Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) in the fashion sector face significant challenges in this e - commerce landscape , particularly in live streaming . Recent surveys reveal that a majority of Indonesian SMEs have experienced losses due to live streaming or live commerce , with issues ranging from 35 % product quality not meeting buyer expectations to non - competitive pricing and ineffective promotional strategies , 23 % dissatisfied customers , and 10 % unattractive live streaming content . A recent survey in Indonesia highlights several challenges faced by small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) due to live streaming or direct trading . A survey conducted by Ipsos in 2022 revealed that 37 % of SMEs in Indonesia faced losses due to their products not meeting the buyers ' expectations . Another survey conducted by Populix in the same year revealed that 28 % of SMEs experienced losses due to non - competitive pricing in direct trade . Furthermore , a survey conducted by CNBC Indonesia in 2022 revealed that 25 % of SMEs faced losses due to ineffective promotional strategies during their live - streaming sessions ( Ahdiat , 2022 ) . International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1951 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 The Indonesian fashion industry , a key player in the national economy , is going through a significant digital transition , particularly for small and medium - sized enterprises ( SMEs ) . These SMEs play a crucial role in innovation and industrial growth , but they face challenges in adapting to the fast - paced world of e - commerce . In the context of live shopping platform business , it was discovered that factors like perceived media richness ( Li et al . , 2021 ) , perceived price fairness ( Dwinanda et al . , 2022 ; Li et al . , 2021 ) , electronic word - of - mouth ( Edeline & Praptiningsih , 2022 ; Hasena & Sakapurnama , 2021 ) , social marketing ( Waworuntu et al . , 2022 ) , and brand image ( Edeline & Praptiningsih , 2022 ; Hasena & Sakapurnama , 2021 ; Waworuntu et al . , 2022 ) have a significant impact on customers ' purchase intentions after a literature review and construct investigation was created . In the context of live commerce platforms , these variables will be investigated to find out their impact on Indonesian consumers ' purchase intentions to enhance product sales , especially in the fashion industry . LITERATURE REVIEW Current Live Streaming Strategy In the realm of digital commerce , live streaming has emerged as a revolutionary strategy , significantly impacting industries such as e - commerce , education , tourism , entertainment , gaming , and social media . This transformation is particularly significant in the fashion industry , where live streaming has become a crucial element in enhancing product sales and customer engagement . The integration of live streaming in e - commerce has redefined the shopping experience . Ma ( 2022 ) emphasizes its transformative impact , highlighting those businesses using live shopping platform experience significantly enhanced customer interaction and satisfaction . A study by Chen et al . ( 2022 ) supports this , finding that effective live - streaming marketing strategies led to a 20 % increase in sales and a 15 % increase in customer satisfaction for fashion brands . These findings highlight the potential of live streaming to facilitate immediate and interactive communication between sellers and consumers , which is especially beneficial for Indonesian fashion SMEs , as they can directly address customer concerns and showcase products in real time . The influence of live streaming extends beyond e - commerce . As per Ma ( 2022 ) and Lee & Chen ( 2021 ) , live streaming has reformed education by enabling remote interactive lessons , and in the entertainment industry , it has transformed event broadcasting . Han ( 2022 ) notes its impact across various sectors , asserting that live streaming has created new opportunities and revolutionized the way industries connect with their audiences . In Indonesia , live streaming has gained substantial traction across multiple industries . Dong et al . ( 2023 ) and ( Writer , 2023 ) report its widespread adoption in tourism , education , entertainment , and gaming . This widespread adoption is partly due to the rapid development of the internet and the widespread of mobile devices in the country , as stated by ( Statista , 2023a , 2023b ) . The adaptability of live streaming in various fields demonstrates its versatility as a tool for disseminating information and engaging with audiences . The differentiation between live streaming commerce , vlogging , and video streaming is critical in understanding their unique impacts on consumer behavior ( D . Liu & Yu , 2022 ; Ming et al . , 2021 ; P . Xu et al . , 2022 ; X . Xu et al . , 2020 ) . Each platform offers different ways to connect with audiences , with live - streaming commerce standing out for its real - time engagement and direct influence on consumer purchasing decisions . Focusing on the Indonesian fashion industry , live - streaming shopping platforms is a strategic tool for SMEs to expand their market reach ( Firdaus & Kusdibyo , 2021a ; Guo et al . , 2021 ) . The platform’s live streaming feature , as indicated by Snapcart ' s survey , aligns well with the trend of online fashion shopping . Shopee’s introduction of live streaming in 2019 was a significant milestone , offering fashion SMEs a platform for real - time product demonstrations and customer engagement , leading to a 30 % increase in website traffic and a 10 % increase in conversion rates for fashion brands ( Han , 2022 ) Despite its potential , many Indonesian fashion SMEs struggle to effectively utilize live streaming due to gaps in digital literacy and marketing skills . This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for these SMEs to adapt and improve their strategies to fully capitalize on the growing trend of live commerce . The current live - streaming strategy in the Indonesian fashion industry is a vital area of exploration for understanding the dynamics of purchasing intentions . This section of the literature review underscores the significance of live streaming in enhancing product sales through direct customer engagement and interaction , especially for Indonesian fashion SMEs . The aim is to assess and explore the factors influencing purchasing intentions in the fashion industry through live commerce streaming . This exploration International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1952 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 is expected to yield insights and strategies that align with evolving consumer preferences and the rapidly changing digital landscape in Indonesia . SMEs in Indonesia In Indonesia ' s active e - commerce scene , small and medium - sized businesses are making great progress thanks to live commerce streaming feature . This tool has become a game - changer for these businesses , not just for promoting their products but also for connecting with more customers ( H . - C . Chen et al . , 2022 ; L . Chen et al . , 2022b ; Ye et al . , 2022b ) . Live streaming lets businesses show off their products on the spot , answer questions from shoppers , and build trust , which is crucial in the online market where competition is intense ( Hwang & Youn , 2023 ) . Additionally , live streaming on Shopee has been a keyway for smaller businesses to get noticed and compete with bigger brands ( Rohmah et al . , 2021 ) . It makes it easier to spread the word about their products , which greatly affects what shoppers decide to buy . This means more interaction with customers , better shopping experiences , and a stronger excitement around their products , leading to better business results ( Lin & Nuangjamnong , 2022 ) . When the COVID - 19 pandemic hit , digital platforms became even more important for fashion businesses . With many physical shops closed or limited , using apps and live streaming on social media became a smart and affordable way for these businesses to keep reaching out to customers ( Villa & Monzón , 2021 ; Wali et al . , 2020 ) . Research has shown that business owners in Indonesia and other places quickly turned to apps and live streaming on sites to cope with the pandemic ' s challenges ( Raco et al . , 2021 ) . This move was especially beneficial for the fashion industry , where live streaming changed how products are promoted and how shops talk to customers ( Purmiyati et al . , 2022 ) . The role of these businesses in Indonesia ' s fashion industry is important not just for coming up with new products and reaching more people , but also for the country ' s economy . The government ' s Ministry of SMEs has noticed how digital marketing on platforms like Shopee helps boost sales and keep businesses going , especially in the fashion industry ( Firdaus & Kusdibyo , 2021b ) . Indonesian fashion businesses are known for their creativity , flexibility , and quickness to adapt . These strengths help them stay in tune with what customers want and the latest trends . The fashion industry is an important part of Indonesia ' s cultural and economic life , drawing in both business owners and shoppers ( Andriana & Puspitawati , 2022 ) . In places like West Java , the industry is well - known and efficient , making it ripe for new ideas and growth ( Indrawati et al . , 2019 ; Tseng et al . , 2021 ) . Using Shopee ' s live streaming and other digital resources , these smaller businesses can show off their creativity and unique styles to more people , helping them grow and succeed in the competitive fashion industry . Perceived Media Richness The idea of perceived media richness can be described as the perception of how effectively a communication medium conveys information , utilizing a high degree of sensory and emotional signals ( H . - C . Chen et al . , 2022 ) . In the context of live streaming shopping platform , perceived media richness relates to the platform ' s effectiveness in conveying information through audio , visual , and interactive elements ( X . Liu et al . , 2022 ) . In a previous study conducted by Li et al . ( 2021 ) , it was demonstrated that the perceived media richness significantly influences buyers ' intention to make purchases on live shopping platform . This current study adopts a similar framework , focusing on perceived media richness as a construct to assess consumers ' perception of the richness and quality of content to enhance the purchase intention , particularly in the fashion industry , presented through live streaming shopping features . Expanding on Li et al . ( 2021 ) research , the hypothesis suggests that a higher perceived media richness will result in an increased purchase intention among consumers . Li et al . ' s findings indicate that consumers are more likely to make purchases when they perceive the content offered through live - streaming features as rich and of high quality . Perceived Price Fairness Perceived price fairness , a variable within the conceptual framework in this study , refers to how consumers perceive the fairness and reasonableness of the prices associated with products or services offered through Shopee ' s live streaming feature . This variable holds significance as consumer perceptions of price fairness play a crucial role in shaping their intentions to make purchases ( En & Balakrishnan , 2022 ) . In a prior study conducted by Dwinanda et al . ( 2022 ) in Indonesia , it was revealed that consumers ' perceived price fairness had a notable positive impact on their intentions to make purchases . Derived from this earlier research , the hypothesis suggests that an enhanced perception of price fairness will result in increased purchase intentions among consumers International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1953 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 within the context of live streaming shopping platform . As suggested by Li et al . ( 2021 ) , perceived price fairness stands out as a crucial factor positively influencing consumers ' intentions to make purchases . Electronic Word of Mouth Electronic Word Of Mouth ( eWOM ) emerges as a crucial factor for examination concerning consumers ' intentions to make purchases on live - streaming shopping platform . eWOM , defined as the digital exchange of opinions , recommendations , and experiences regarding products or services among consumers ( Güler & Huseynov , 2021 ) , holds significance in influencing consumers ' purchase intentions , as evidenced by previous research conducted by Hasena & Sakapurnama ( 2021 ) . This research highlighted the substantial impact of eWOM on live - streaming shopping platform , particularly within the cosmetics industry , indicating that positive word of mouth significantly shapes consumers ' perceptions of brand image , ultimately leading to increased purchase intentions . Building upon these findings , it is hypothesized that a higher level of positive eWOM on Shopee will result in increased purchase intentions among consumers in the context of live streaming . Social Media Marketing The concept of Social Media Marketing ( SMM ) involves utilizing social media platforms to promote products or services and engage with the target audience . As per the findings of Waworuntu et al . ( 2022 ) social media marketing ( SMM ) activities , including live - streaming shopping , have gained substantial influence in shaping consumers ' purchasing behaviors . Their research highlights the positive impact of SMM activities , particularly live streaming , on consumers ' intentions to make purchases . The study by Waworuntu et al . ( 2022 ) explores how SMM influences brand image and consumer purchase intentions , specifically among Generation Z . The results underscore that the utilization of Social Media Marketing ( SMM ) has a favorable and significant effect on brand image and purchase intentions among Gen Z consumers , particularly in the context of local products . Building upon these previous findings , it is hypothesized that employing SMM through live streaming on Shopee will positively impact consumers ' purchase intentions by enhancing their perception of brand image and fostering trust and confidence in the promoted product or service . Brand Image The perception of a brand holds a pivotal role in shaping how consumers perceptions and decide on purchases . It encompasses the overall reputation , perceived quality , and credibility of a brand from the consumers ' perspective ( Batool et al . , 2020 ) . Utilizing live streaming shopping platform provides businesses with the opportunity to visually showcase their products or services engagingly and interactively ( Dong et al . , 2023 ) , ultimately contributing to an enhanced perception of the brand and the creation of a positive brand image . In the study conducted by Hasena & Sakapurnama ( 2021 ) , it was discovered that word of mouth on live - streaming shopping platforms significantly influenced consumers ' intentions to purchase cosmetics through the lens of brand image . The research concluded that a more positive representation of brand image on live shopping platform led to higher purchase intentions among consumers . Similarly , the research by Waworuntu et al . ( 2022 ) indicated that Social Media Marketing ( SMM ) through live streaming platforms positively impacted consumers ' perception of brand image , resulting in an increase in purchase intentions . The analysis in this study will delve into brand image as a mediator , seeking to comprehend how live - streaming shopping platform shapes consumers ' perception of a brand and , consequently , influences their intentions to make a purchase . RESEARCH METHOD Conceptual Framework This study aims to investigate the factors influencing purchase intentions in the fashion industry through live commerce streaming platform . The focus is specifically on understanding how perceived media richness , perceived price fairness , electronic word of mouth ( eWOM ) , social media marketing ( SMM ) , and brand image impact consumer decisions to purchase fashion products . This investigation is crucial for enhancing fashion product sales in the rapidly evolving e - commerce landscape . Perceived Media Richness : This factor is crucial in the context of live streaming on Shopee , as it refers to how well the platform conveys information with sensory and emotional cues . The ability of the platform to deliver rich , interactive , and engaging content influences consumer behavior ( H . - C . Chen et al . , 2022 ; D . Liu & Yu , 2022 ; X . Liu et al . , 2022 ) . The richer the media , the more International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1954 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 likely consumers are to develop a strong understanding and appreciation of the products , potentially leading to higher purchase intentions . Perceived Price Fairness : This variable relates to how consumers perceive the fairness of prices on Shopee ' s live streaming service . If consumers deem the prices as reasonable and justifiable , they are more likely to proceed with a purchase ( Dwinanda et al . , 2022 ; En & Balakrishnan , 2022 ) . Fair pricing strategies can enhance consumer trust and loyalty , making it a critical factor in the decision - making process . Electronic Word of Mouth ( eWOM ) : eWOM is included due to its significant influence on consumers ' perceptions and buying decisions . Positive eWOM on live commerce streaming , in the form of reviews and recommendations , can boost consumer confidence and shape purchase intentions ( Hasena & Sakapurnama , 2021 ) . This variable is especially impactful in online environments where physical examination of products is not possible . Social Media Marketing ( SMM ) : SMM activities , particularly live streaming on Shopee , play a key role in modern consumer engagement strategies . Effective SMM can enhance brand visibility and appeal , thus positively affecting consumer purchase intentions ( Waworuntu et al . , 2022 ) . The inclusion of SMM in the framework recognizes the shift in marketing strategies towards more interactive and consumer - centric approaches . Brand Image : Brand image is an integral part of the framework as it represents consumers ' overall perception of a brand ' s reputation , quality , and credibility . A positive brand image , cultivated through effective live - streaming strategies on Shopee , can significantly influence consumer purchase intentions ( Batool et al . , 2020 ; Dong et al . , 2023 ) . Hasena & Sakapurnama ( 2021 ) , as well as ( Waworuntu et al . , 2022 ) highlight the importance of brand image as a mediator between marketing efforts and consumer behavior . In this study , the chosen variables are integral to understanding the dynamics of consumer behavior in the context of live streaming on e - commerce platforms . By analyzing the impact of these factors , the study seeks to provide insights into how fashion SMEs can optimize their live - streaming strategies to enhance product sales and strengthen their market position . The framework highlights the interconnectedness of these variables and their collective influence on consumer purchase intentions , offering a comprehensive approach to examining Shopee ' s live - streaming business strategy .

It is hypothesized that the chosen variables that have been chosen to influence the purchasing interest in fashion products . The research methodology for this study adopts a quantitative approach , focusing on collecting and analyzing data to understand the impact of live - streaming shopping platforms on the Indonesian fashion industry . The study focused on Indonesian customers who have engaged in fashion product shopping on live - streaming platforms within the last three months . This approach ensures that the respondents possess relevant and recent experiences , offering valuable insights for the study . The author employs a survey to collect the empirical data from the respondents through a closed - ended questionnaire . The questionnaire specifically targets individuals who have utilized live streaming for fashion product shopping at least once within the last three months . The survey method is used to get information by asking questions to the people who are participating ( Ahmadi & Hudrasyah , 2022 ; Malhotra , 2010 ) . The questionnaire is designed around a theoretical framework incorporating key factors influencing purchase intentions , such as perceived media richness , perceived price fairness , electronic word of mouth ( eWOM ) , social media marketing ( SMM ) , and brand image . These constructs are vital for comprehending consumer perceptions and interactions with live - streaming platforms in the context of fashion product purchases . The survey ' s goal is to determine the effects of these constructs on fashion product purchase intentions , providing quantifiable data for pattern and correlation analysis . Convenience sampling was used to gather empirical data on how customers perceive and intend to behave towards fashion products in an online survey . According to Hair et al . ( 2011 ) , when the sample size is excessively large , like 400 , then the method becomes highly sensitive , making it challenging to obtain a reliable goodness - of - fit measure . Therefore , it is recommended to have a minimum sample size of 5 - 10 observations for each estimated parameter . This study consists of 25 questions indicators . The required sample size ranges from 125 respondents ( 25 x 5 ) to 250 respondents ( 25 x 10 ) . A structured survey consisting of respondent profile questions and 25 primary questions was created . The questions were assessed using a five - point Likert scale , where 1 corresponds to " strongly disagree , " and 5 corresponds to " strongly agree . " The questionnaire was categorized into seven sections : respondent profile , perceptions of model richness , fairness of prices , electronic word of mouth ( eWOM ) , social media marketing , brand image , and purchase intention on a live streaming platform for the fashion industry . Subsequently , the questionnaire was distributed to individuals in Indonesia who had engaged in live - streaming shopping within the past three months . After gathering data through the distributed questionnaire , the authors input the results into Microsoft Excel , intending to transfer them to smartPLS for further processing and research development ( Ahmadi & Hudrasyah , 2022 ) . The quantitative analysis process will involve using Smart PLS software ( v4 ) to test the study model . In assessing the PLS - SEM model , the analysis will be conducted in two primary steps : evaluating the measurement model and then examining the structural model . The measurement model assessment will focus on the reliability and validity of the measurement items used to operationalize the variables . Key metrics for this assessment will include outer loadings , average variance extracted ( AVE ) , composite reliability , and Cronbach ' s alpha . These metrics help ensure that the model is valid , reliable , and fits the data well . Cronbach ' s alpha , in particular , will be used to assess the internal consistency of the variables , with a threshold of 0 . 70 indicating adequate reliability . Each indicator ' s loading on its related latent construct should ideally be higher than 0 . 7 , as recommended by Hair et al . ( 2011 ) . The structural model assessment will then analyze the relationships between the variables and test the proposed hypotheses . This includes examining paths , coefficients , and overall model fit to draw conclusions about the hypotheses and the study ' s theoretical underpinnings . Through this comprehensive methodology , which combines a targeted survey approach with sophisticated statistical analysis , the study is specifically designed to assess the factors that influence purchase intentions within the Indonesian fashion industry , particularly in the context of live - streaming shopping platforms . By focusing on key variables such as perceived media richness , perceived price fairness , electronic word of mouth ( eWOM ) , social media marketing ( SMM ) , and brand image , the research aims to uncover how these elements interact and impact the decision - making process of consumers . This targeted investigation will International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1956 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 provide valuable insights into the dynamics driving consumer behavior in the evolving e - commerce landscape of Indonesia , ultimately offering strategies for enhancing product sales through effective utilization of live - streaming capabilities . FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION Quantitative Analysis Based on the online survey , the collected dataset of 228 is within the required sample size range , which ranges from 125 respondents ( 25 x 5 ) to 250 respondents ( 25 x 10 ) , following the general rule of having a sample size at least five times the number of indicators , as suggested by Hair et al . ( 2011 ) . The data reveals a distribution of 19 % males and 81 % females among the respondents . A significant portion ( 80 % ) of participants reported a monthly income below 5 million rupiah , while 17 % fall into the middle - income category . The majority of respondents ( 77 % ) are in the late teens or early twenties ( 18 to 20 years old ) . Additionally , more than half of the respondents hold a bachelor ' s degree , accounting for over 50 % . For the quantitative data analysis , this study will primarily utilize Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling ( PLS - SEM ) . This statistical technique is exceptionally suited for examining complex relationships between multiple variables , such as the influence of perceived media richness , perceived price fairness , eWOM , SMM , and brand image on consumers ' intentions to purchase fashion products via live streaming . PLS - SEM is particularly effective for exploratory research , where the relationships between variables may be multifaceted and not fully understood . In evaluating the PLS - SEM model , the analysis is divided into two main stages : first , evaluating the measurement model , and then examining the structural model . The first part , the measurement model assessment , is about making sure the tools used for measuring the variables are reliable and accurate . Important measures for this include outer loadings , average extracted ( AVE ) , composite reliability , and Cronbach’s alpha . These measures are essential to confirm that the model is valid , reliable , and suitable for the data . The second part , the structural model assessment , focuses on exploring the connections between the variables and testing the proposed hypotheses Hair et al . ( 2011 ) . This involves examining paths , coefficients , and how well the model as a whole fits , to make informed conclusions about the hypotheses and main ideas of the study . The quantitative results of the study indicate a significant relationship between perceived model richness and purchase intention , supported by a positive path coefficient and p - value . Perceived price fairness also shows a positive impact on purchase intention . However , electronic word of mouth did not significantly influence the brand image . Social media marketing had a strong positive effect on brand image , which in turn significantly affected purchase intention . The structural model testing confirms these findings , with brand image mediating the relationship between social media marketing and purchase intention . Overall , four out of five hypotheses were accepted , highlighting the importance of content quality and fair pricing in influencing consumer purchase intentions on live shopping platforms . Validity and Reliability Analysis A validity test is carried out to confirm that the constructed statements and questions created for the questionnaire are appropriate and accurate . A reliability test is conducted to assess how consistent and stable the responses are for each question in a valid questionnaire . Table 1 presents the results for outer loadings , internal consistency , and convergent reliability . The result of the analysis reveals the strong validity and reliability of the constructs . The Cronbach ' s alpha and composite reliability values for all constructs are above the 0 . 7 benchmark , indicating high internal consistency and the ability to produce consistent results . Additionally , the average variance extracted ( AVE ) for all constructs is above the 0 . 5 threshold , which confirms the convergent validity of the model . Although some individual outer loadings are around 0 . 6 , the overall reliability is higher than 0 . 8 , further affirming the model ' s reliability and consistency . Table 1 .

It validates that each construct represents a unique aspect , not just repeating what other variables in the model are showing . The Fornell - Larcker Criterion is a traditional method for assessing discriminant validity . According to this criterion , the square root of the Average Variance Extracted ( AVE ) for each construct should be greater than any correlations between that construct and others in the model . This means that each construct should have a stronger relationship with its own indicators than with other constructs . This is crucial to ensure that each construct uniquely represents a specific concept , which is vital for the accuracy and reliability of the research outcomes ( Fornell & Larcker , 1981 ) . Analyzing the results presented in Table 2 , the discriminant validity of the constructs within the measurement model has been established according to the Fornell - Larcker Criterion . The square roots of the AVE for each construct , highlighted in bold , are greater than their highest corresponding correlation coefficients with other constructs , indicating a satisfactory level of discriminant validity ( Fornell & Larcker , 1981 ) . For instance , the AVE square root for the ' Brand Image ' construct is 0 . 835 , and its highest correlation with any other construct ( ' Purchase Intention ' ) is 0 . 709 , which is less than the square root of the AVE . This pattern is consistent across all constructs , confirming that the constructs are empirically distinct , and the model is suitable for further analysis .

The R square statistic indicates the extent to which changes in independent variables explain variations . The key difference between the R squared and the adjusted R squared values lies in their assumptions : the R squared value assumes that all independent variables impact the model’s result , whereas the adjusted R squared considers only those independent variables that significantly affect the model’s performance . Many researchers prefer using the adjusted R - squared over the basic R - squared as it offers a more accurate reflection of the relationship , considering the number of independent factors included in the model ( Cohen , 1988 ) . Table 3 presents the results of the structural model assessment . In this study , the R - square value for Brand Image ( BI ) is 0 . 572 , indicating that the model accounts for 57 . 2 % of the variation in BI . The R - squared value for Purchase Intention ( PI ) is slightly higher at 0 . 596 , meaning the model explains 59 . 6 % of PI . these R - squared values , being over 0 . 5 , show that the model is quite effective . F - square , another important metric , measures the impact on R - square when a specific independent variable is removed from the model . An F - square value between 0 . 02 and 0 . 15 is considered small , between 0 . 15 and 0 . 35 is medium , and above 0 . 35 is large . According to this , BI has a medium effect size on PI , and Social Media Marketing ( SMM ) has large effect on BI . Electronic Word of Mouth ( eWOM ) shows small effect sizes on both BI and PI .

According to Hair et al . ( 2019 ) , the Variance Inflation Factor ( VIF ) is a useful tool for this . If the VIF value is above 5 , it suggests there might be collinearity between the constructs used for prediction . A VIF value around 3 or lower is generally considered favorable . The Path Coefficient Analysis and Hypothesis Testing outlined in Table 4 provides a detailed view of the structural model ' s performance in the context of live - streaming commerce . The analysis shows that perceived model richness ( PMR ) significantly increases purchase intention ( PI ) , with a path coefficient ( β ) of 0 . 256 and a p - value less than 0 . 05 , confirming Hypothesis 1 . Perceived price fairness ( PPF ) also positively affects purchase intention ( β = 0 . 222 , p < 0 . 05 ) , which supports Hypothesis 2 . However , electronic word - of - mouth ( eWOM ) does not have a significant effect on brand image ( BI ) , and thus Hypothesis 3 is not supported ( β = 0 . 085 , p > 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , social media marketing ( SMM ) has a strong positive influence on brand image ( β = 0 . 696 , p < 0 . 001 ) , which supports Hypothesis 4 . Furthermore , brand image has a significant and positive impact on purchase intention ( β = 0 . 418 , p < 0 . 001 ) , making Hypothesis 5 also supported . The VIF values for all predictors are below the commonly accepted threshold of 5 , which indicates that there is no significant multicollinearity affecting the model , meaning that the predictors , like perceived model richness and price fairness , are not overly correlated with one another . This suggests that each variable ' s impact on consumer behavior is being measured distinctly , adding confidence to the model ' s reliability . The results imply that the factors examined—model richness , price fairness , and social media marketing—are indeed significant in shaping consumer decisions . Model richness and price fairness directly enhance purchase intention by positively influencing consumers ' perceived value . Social media marketing boosts brand image effectively , further influencing purchase decisions . The low Variance Inflation Factors ( VIF ) indicate that there is no collinearity among the variables , strengthening the research findings and highlighting their significance in influencing online consumer buying decisions .

The analysis , based on the framework by International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1960 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 Hair et al . ( 2019 ) , reveals distinct pathways of influence . Interestingly , when it comes to eWOM and PI , BI does not seem to play a mediatory role . For the path from eWOM to PI , the indirect effect through BI was not significant ( b = 0 . 026 , p = 0 . 322 ) , nor was the direct effect ( b = 0 . 167 , p = 0 . 113 ) , indicating that BI does not mediate the eWOM to PI relationship . Therefore , eWOM does not seem to influence PI through BI within this study ' s framework . Conversely , for SMM to PI , BI acts as a full mediator . This is shown by a significant indirect effect ( b = 0 . 228 , p = 0 . 001 ) and a non - significant direct effect ( b = 0 . 079 , p = 0 . 330 ) . The substantial total effect ( b = 0 . 699 , p < 0 . 001 ) supports the mediation , suggesting that BI fully accounts for the impact of SMM on PI . In conclusion , brand image is a pivotal intermediary for the influence of social media marketing on purchase intentions but does not play a mediating role in the relationship between electronic word - of - mouth and purchase intention .

A comprehensive analysis of consumer behavior on live shopping platforms was conducted , leading to significant findings regarding the factors that influence purchase intentions . Out of five hypotheses tested , four were supported , while one was not . In summary , using Path Analysis , the writer could determine which factors that have a significant towards another . The factor that has p < 0 . 05 is considered to have a significant impact . Perceived media richness has a significant impact on purchase intention . Perceived price fairness has a significant impact on purchase intention . Electronic Word of Mouth ( eWOM ) has no significant impact on brand image towards purchase intention . Social media marketing has a significant impact on brand image towards purchase intention . Argument quality has a significant impact on attitude towards product . Lastly , attitude toward a product has a significant impact on purchase intention . CONCLUSION In conclusion , this study significantly highlights the significant impact of Shopee ' s live - streaming platform on consumer purchasing decisions within the Indonesian fashion industry . The analysis revealed that four out of the five proposed factors based on previous studies play a crucial role in influencing consumer behavior . Firstly , the study confirms the hypothesis regarding perceived media richness . It establishes that the engaging and interactive nature of Shopee ' s live streaming , characterized by its high - quality audio - visual content , significantly influences consumer purchase intentions . This finding underscores the importance of a rich sensory and immersive experience in enhancing online shopping appeal . Secondly , this study confirms the impact of perceived price fairness on the intention to buy . It is observed that customers are more likely to make a purchase when they believe the prices on the platform are fair and match the product’s value . This underlines the importance of effective pricing strategies in online retail , as they play a significant role in shaping consumers’ perceived value and their decision - making process . Additionally , the research supports the influence of social media marketing on enhancing brand image , which in turn positively influences buying decisions . This underscores the value of well - planned social media tactics in creating a robust and favorable brand image , leading to increased consumer purchases . Furthermore , the research highlights the crucial role of brand image as an intermediary in the link between social media marketing and consumer buying decisions . A strong and positive brand image , shaped through effective live streaming and social media interactions , plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of consumer purchases . Contrary to what was initially thought , electric word - of - mouth ( eWOM ) did not show a notable influence on either brand image or buying intentions . This indicates that there may be more complex interactions or unique aspects in the Indonesian fashion industry , where eWOM might have a different impact than expected . The findings clearly demonstrate the power of live - streaming platforms as a key strategy for small and medium - sized fashion businesses . It emphasizes the need to focus on producing high - quality content , setting prices , and building a solid brand image through dedicated social media marketing . These approaches do more than just boost sales ; they are critical in creating a loyal customer vase , as shown by the positive reactions and direct engagement achieved through live streaming . Fundamentally , the study suggests that for fashion SMEs looking to succeed in the online market , integrating live streaming into their marketing and sales tactics is not just advantageous , but necessary . By effectively utilizing live streaming’s potential , along with fair pricing and robust social media marketing , fashion SMEs can significantly enhance customer involvement and impact their buying choices . LIMITATION & FURTHER RESEARCH This study , focusing on the Indonesian fashion industry as of 2023 , presents findings that may not be widely applicable to other markets or industries , potentially limiting its broader relevance . The reliance on a relatively small sample size , primarily reflecting current consumer perceptions and behaviors towards live shopping platforms , may not encompass the diversity of broader consumer demographics . Additionally , the demographic diversity of the survey respondents might have influenced the outcomes , as a more varied participant pool could yield different results . Furthermore , the study ' s concentration on current trends without accounting for historical data or future projections narrows its scope , affecting the study’s overall conclusions and applicability . Future research has significant opportunities to expand upon this study . It could explore similar models in different cultural or geographical contexts , verifying the findings across various e - commerce platforms . Also , looking into live streaming ' s effects in non - fashion industries would offer a broader view of its efficiency . Longitudinal studies would be valuable in understanding the International Journal of Current Science Research and Review ISSN : 2581 - 8341 Volume 07 Issu e 03 March 2024 DOI : 10 . 47191 / ijcsrr / V7 - i3 - 57 , Impact Factor : 7 . 943 IJCSRR @ 2024 www . ijcsrr . org 1962 * Corresponding Author : Rina Adibah Volume 07 Issue 03 March 2024 Available at : www . ijcsrr . org Page No . 1948 - 1965 evolving impact of live streaming on consumer choices and behaviors . Additionally , future studies should investigate how digital marketing strategies affect different consumer groups like millennials and Gen Z , particularly in terms of brand loyalty . The potential of new technologies , such as augmented reality , in enhancing live shopping experiences is another promising research area . This could provide deeper insights into new consumer engagement methods . Moreover , exploring the effectiveness of digital marketing in Indonesia ' s diverse cultural regions could yield insights into the nuances of region - specific marketing strategies . REFERENCES 1 .
