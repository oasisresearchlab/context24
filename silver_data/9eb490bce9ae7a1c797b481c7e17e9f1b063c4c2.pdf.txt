Pharmacists have the ability to perform certain point - of - care tests 6 under federal regulations . On April 8 , 2020 , the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health 7 ( OASH ) issued new guidance authorizing licensed pharmacists to order and administer 8 COVID - 19 tests . 9 10 Objective 11 The primary objective of this study was to investigate the views of pharmacists about 12 pharmacist - ordered and administered COVID - 19 testing . 13 Methods 14 A 13 - item questionnaire was developed to survey pharmacists who currently hold an 15 active license in Rhode Island . 16 Results 17 One hundred and twenty - two pharmacists ( 13 . 8 % ) consented and responded to at least 18 one question of the survey . The results indicated that the primary concern of pharmacists 19 in regard to performing COVID - 19 testing was spreading the infection to family members 20 ( 71 . 3 % ) . Becoming personally infected ( 59 . 8 % ) and not having access to appropriate 21 personal protective equipment ( PPE ) ( 62 . 3 % ) were the second and third most common 22 concern of pharmacists . Almost all pharmacists ( 99 . 9 % ) responded that they would be 23 willing to take part in the testing process if they had appropriate PPE . Forty - six percent of 24 pharmacists expressed concern regarding reimbursement for their company while 56 % of 25 pharmacists requested personal compensation for this service . 26 Discussion 27 Expanding the pool of healthcare professionals who can perform testing is critical to 28 achieving and sustaining proposed testing thresholds . Rhode Island pharmacists are willing 29 to take part in performing COVID - 19 testing , provided appropriate PPE is available and 30 services are reimbursed . 31 Pharmacists are the most accessible and essential healthcare providers willing to take on 32 critically important roles during the COVID19 pandemic , provided appropriate safety 33 measures can be met . 34 35 36 37 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Key Points 1 2 Background : 3 ● Barrier - free testing is a principle component to reopening society and bringing the 4 coronavirus pandemic to an end . 5 ● Pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare professional and have the ability to 6 perform certain point - of - care tests under federal regulations . On April 8 , 2020 , the 7 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health ( OASH ) issued new guidance authorizing 8 licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID - 19 tests . 9 ● Healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting COVID - 19 and personal 10 protective equipment ( PPE ) that is not normally utilized in pharmacies is required 11 to ensure the safety of those who perform tests . 12 Findings : 13 ● Most pharmacists are willing to order and administer COVID - 19 tests with proper 14 PPE . Pharmacists feel most comfortable collecting nasal or saliva samples as 15 compared to nasopharyngeal or blood samples . 16 ● The most common concerns pharmacists expressed regarding COVID - 19 testing are 17 having access to PPE and bringing home the infection to their families . 18 TEXT 19 20 Introduction 21 22 The first case of the novel coronavirus , SARS - CoV - 2 , was reported in the United 23 States ( U . S ) on January 19 , 2020 , and by October 3 rd , 2020 , there were over 7 . 3 million 24 cases in the U . S accounting for over 205 , 000deaths . 1 , 2 Similar to influenza , SARS - CoV - 2 25 transmits primarily through respiratory droplets . 3 Although young healthy people can be 26 infected , develop critical illness , and die , the majority of death from the virus occurs in 27 older people with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease . 4 What may be the 28 most dangerous aspect of SAR2 - CoV - 2 and subsequent COVID - 19 infection , is 29 asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic transmission spread . 5 Symptoms develop between 30 two to fourteen days after exposure , which allows for transmission of the disease without 31 the vector’s knowledge 6 Healthcare professionals and leaders need to take a unique 32 approach in identifying opportunities for early screening and mitigating risk of widespread 33 infection transmission . 7 , 8 34 35 The period of COVID - 19 infection without symptoms leaves individuals and the 36 healthcare community uninformed , posing the greatest risk for transmission of disease . 37 Allowing anyone to obtain a COVID - 19 test by removing barriers to testing , leads to quicker 38 isolation , contact tracing , and quarantine . The United States does not have a unified 39 national testing infrastructure , leaving decisions on testing to states . 9 This has led to 40 widespread logistical and operational problems with acquisition of limited supplies of 41 testing equipment and reagents , slowing the delivery of results . As of this writing , the US 42 leads the world in per capita cases , hospitalizations , and deaths . 1 Still , governors across the 43 U . S . have developed systematic , evidence - based approaches to testing and other harm 44 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f reduction approaches like masking , hand hygiene , and social distancing , that have allowed 1 some states to re - open their economies . The success and execution of these plans , including 2 Rhode Island’s , is dependent on testing . 9 , 10 3 4 Pharmacy practice continues to fill gaps in health care and population health to 5 address unmet patient needs . Most households in the U . S . are within 5 miles of a pharmacy 6 and more than one pharmacist . 11 Patients access pharmacists significantly more frequently 7 than their primary care providers . 12 Community pharmacy - based point of care testing 8 ( POCT ) is one way pharmacists can improve and expand accessibility to services otherwise 9 not readily available to their patients . The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 10 of 1988 ( CLIA ) included pharmacies as laboratories , giving them the authorization to 11 perform point of care tests , in accordance with state and federal regulations . Requirements 12 for these tests vary state to state and include 120 low - risk tests , including dyslipidemia , 13 diabetes , influenza and streptococcus Group A . 13 As of July 20 , 2020 , over 14 , 000 14 pharmacies have been issued a CLIA waiver to perform POCT . 14 15 16 On April 8 , 2020 , the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health ( OASH ) issued new 17 guidance under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act ( PREP Act ) 18 authorizing licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID - 19 tests that the U . S . Food 19 and Drug Administration has authorized via the Emergency Use Agreement ( EUA ) 20 framework . 15 Although guidance was issued under the PREP act that gave pharmacists 21 immunity from liability from claims of loss caused by administration of COVID - 19 tests , the 22 guidance did not address many concerns of pharmacists including reimbursement or lack 23 of personal protective equipment . 24 25 Healthcare workers , especially those who provide treatment and testing to COVID - 26 19 patients , are at a higher risk of contracting the COVID - 19 . 16 The World Health 27 Organization recommend that all healthcare workers who collect specimens use eye 28 protection , a medical mask , a long - sleeve gown , and gloves . 17 This type of personal 29 protective equipment ( PPE ) is not normal daily equipment for pharmacists and pharmacy 30 staff . Preparing pharmacists for COVID - 19 testing , adequate PPE will need to be available . 18 31 The lack of adequate PPE is one of many concerns pharmacists have while maintaining 32 normal operations , 19 much less considering specimen collection and testing for COVID - 19 . 33 34 The aim of this study was to collect views of pharmacists about the potential of 35 pharmacist administered COVID - 19 tests . This survey could help legislatures understand 36 these views and consider them when creating legislation . Additionally , understanding these 37 views would allow pharmacies to make informed decisions and create company policies 38 regarding pharmacist administered COVID - 19 testing that pharmacists would be more 39 likely to willingly accept . 40 41 42 Objectives 43 44 The primary objective of this study is to investigate the views of pharmacists on 45 pharmacist - ordered and administered COVID - 19 testing . 46 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 1 2 Methods 3 4 5 Study design , population and setting 6 7 This was a descriptive survey study that was approved as exempt by the University 8 of Rhode Island IRB . 9 Pharmacists who had email addresses publicly listed with the Rhode Island Department of 10 Health received an email asking them to complete a survey . The professional associations 11 disseminated the study as follows : April 30 th the original message was sent to all 12 pharmacists , May 1 st , the survey was advertised via an electronic newsletter , and on May 13 7 th , a reminder was sent via the association list serve . The survey was also advertised on 14 the Rhode Island Pharmacist’s Association Facebook Live COVID Town Halls held on May 15 6 th and May 13 th . 16 17 Any Rhode Island licensed pharmacist who received an email was eligible to 18 complete the survey . There were no exclusion criteria . . There was no incentive for 19 completing the survey and the survey answers were anonymous and only available to the 20 researchers . The survey remained available for participants to complete between April 21 30th and May 19th 2020 . 22 23 Survey development 24 25 Informed consent was provided prior to completing the survey through the first 26 question of the survey instrument . Three questions were asked to gather demographics 27 about participants , one question was asked about where participants went to gather 28 information about COVID - 19 and eight questions asked participants about their views of 29 ordering and administering COVID - 19 tests . All questions were multiple choice and 30 participants could select more than one answer for seven questions . 31 32 The thirteen - question anonymous survey was designed by study personnel to take 33 less than 10 minutes to complete . Questions and elements were created and written by 34 study personnel collectively . The survey was not piloted nor validated . Participants were 35 able to quit the survey at any time without recording any information . All responses were 36 stored within the Qualtrics ( Qualtrics , Provo , UT ) survey system and were only accessed by 37 the researchers for analyses . 38 39 40 Results 41 A total of 879 pharmacists received an email asking them to complete the survey 42 and 142 pharmacists agreed to take part in the study . One hundred and twenty - two 43 pharmacists ( 13 . 8 % ) consented and responded to at least one question . Ninety - three 44 ( 76 . 2 % ) pharmacists described RI as their primary practice location , 33 ( 22 . 9 % ) indicated 45 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f chain community pharmacy as their primary practice site , and 72 pharmacists ( 59 % ) 1 graduated pharmacy school before 2005 . Table 1 shows all the responses to each question 2 on the survey . The primary concern with COVID - 19 testing was infecting family members 3 from work exposure expressed by 87 ( 71 . 3 % ) pharmacists . If asked to conduct COVID - 19 4 testing , 63 pharmacists ( 51 . 6 % ) felt they would not have access to appropriate PPE if they 5 were to conduct testing . Forty - six pharmacists ( 37 . 7 % ) , indicated that their practice site 6 could not be made safe through modifications for testing . 7 One hundred and four pharmacists ( 90 . 0 % ) were willing to participate in COVID - 19 testing 8 through receiving patient collected samples , collecting samples , ordering tests , selling at 9 home tests , and / or analyzing specimen brought in by a patient . State run testing centers 10 was the preferred testing location among pharmacists ( 70 . 5 % ) . Twenty - one pharmacists 11 ( 17 . 2 % ) indicated that they would not feel comfortable performing COVID - 19 testing in 12 any setting and 7 pharmacists ( 1 . 94 % ) indicated that they would not feel comfortable with 13 any role involved in COVID - 19 testing . . Pharmacists felt most comfortable collecting nasal 14 ( 75 . 4 % ) , saliva ( 73 . 0 % ) and finger stick ( 60 . 7 % ) samples . Collecting samples from patients 15 which are not routinely used in community practice were less preferred . Ultimately , 85 % of 16 pharmacists were comfortable with collecting a sample from at least one of the available 17 methods . 18 One hundred and twenty - one ( 99 . 2 % ) pharmacists would consider ordering and 19 administering COVID - 19 tests if reimbursement were provided , either personally or for 20 their employer . Receiving additional live , instructor - led , training for collection and 21 administration of COVID - 19 tests , was rated as the second most important item . When 22 training and reimbursement were taken into consideration , 81 ( 66 . 4 % ) pharmacists 23 preferred appointment based testing to on - demand testing . 24 Discussion 25 This study indicated that the majority of pharmacists were willing to perform COVID - 19 26 testing . Only a small percentage ( 9 % ) of survey pharmacists indicated that they would not 27 be willing to perform COVID - 19 tests even if it was required by their employer . The results 28 from this study portray willingness of pharmacists to participate in COVID - 19 testing 29 efforts given certain measures can be met . 30 The most common concerns reported among pharmacists were bringing home the 31 infection to family members , not having adequate PPE , and getting personally infected . 32 Additionally , almost half of pharmacists expressed that they felt they would not have access 33 to adequate PPE if they were asked to perform testing . Understandably , if proper PPE is not 34 utilized , the risk of infection is greater and thus the risk of infecting family members is 35 greater . Household transmission frequently occurs asymptomatically , can occur between 36 adults to children , and is riskiest to people greater than 60 years old . . 20 – 22 If adequate PPE 37 were to be guaranteed and supplied to pharmacies throughout the course of testing 38 operations , presumably , all three main concerns would be addressed . Although not directly 39 asked , proper PPE access would likely also reduce the mental health concerns of those 40 surveyed , which have been reported to have increased since the pandemic began . 23 41 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Most pharmacists would feel most comfortable performing COVID - 19 tests at a state - run 1 testing center rather than a chain or independent community pharmacy , primary care 2 location , or emergency room . This aligns with the finding that the majority of pharmacists 3 felt that their current workplace could not be made suitable for COVID - 19 testing , even 4 with changes . A majority of those surveyed were also willing to collect nasal and saliva 5 samples for testing . Nasal and saliva samples are adequate samples for many point - of - care 6 COVID - 19 tests , and they are more comfortable for the patient . 24 According to those 7 surveyed , the ideal testing situation is one where pharmacists are provided adequate PPE 8 in a state - run testing center to collect nasal or saliva samples by appointment only . 9 10 Limitations : 11 No validation was conducted to ensure the reliability and clarity of the questions , which 12 may have led to redundancies and / or misguided questions . This study gathered 13 pharmacists’ views about performing COVID - 19 tests within a single state , Rhode Island . A 14 limitation of this study is that the views of Rhode Island pharmacists may not accurately 15 represent pharmacists’ views nationwide . This survey was conducted during the initial 16 peak in COVID - 19 cases in the state and region which may be part of the cause for limited 17 responses . Several individuals who were invited to partake in the survey do not work in 18 direct patient care and did not complete the survey due to the feeling that the survey was 19 not aimed at them , even though the investigators were looking to collect information from 20 all licensed individuals . 21 Conclusion : 22 Expanding the pool of healthcare professionals who can perform testing is critical to 23 achieving and sustaining proposed testing thresholds . Rhode Island pharmacists are willing 24 to take part in performing COVID - 19 testing , provided appropriate PPE is available and 25 services are reimbursed . 26 27 1 .
