The Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain proteins , including the FCH - BAR ( F - BAR ) domain proteins , impose speci ﬁ c morphologies on lipid membranes . Most BAR domain proteins are thought to form membrane invaginations or protrusions by assembling into helical submicron - diameter ﬁ laments , such as on clathrin - coated pits , caveolae , and ﬁ lopodia . However , the mechanism by which BAR domain proteins assemble into micron - scale pha - gocytic cups was unclear . Here , we show that the two - dimensional sheet - like assembly of Growth Arrest - Speci ﬁ c 7 ( GAS7 ) plays a critical role in phagocytic cup formation in mac - rophages . GAS7 has the F - BAR domain that possesses unique hydrophilic loops for two - dimensional sheet formation on ﬂ at membranes . Super - resolution microscopy reveals the similar assemblies of GAS7 on phagocytic cups and liposomes . The mutations of the loops abolishes both the membrane localization of GAS7 and phagocytosis . Thus , the sheet - like assembly of GAS7 plays a signi ﬁ cant role in phagocytosis . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w OPEN 1 Nara Institute of Science and Technology , Ikoma 630 - 0192 , Japan . 2 University of Tokyo , Tokyo 113 - 0032 , Japan . 3 School of Life Science and Technology , Tokyo Institute of Technology , Tokyo 152 - 8550 , Japan . 4 RIKEN SPring - 8 Center , Sayo , Hyogo 679 - 5148 , Japan . 5 Institute for Protein Research , Osaka University , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . 6 Theoretical Biology Laboratory , RIKEN , Wako 351 - 0198 , Japan . 7 Division of Structural Biology , Medical Institute of Bioregulation , Kyushu University , Fukuoka 812 - 8582 , Japan . 8 Present address : Science for Life Laboratory , Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , Stockholm University , Stockholm , Sweden . 9 Present address : Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance , Life Science Center for Survival Dynamics , University of Tsukuba , Tsukuba , Japan . 10 These authors contributed equally : Kyoko Hanawa - Suetsugu , Yuzuru Itoh , Maisarah Ab Fatah , Tamako Nishimura . * email : ashimada @ bioreg . kyushu - u . ac . jp ; suetsugu @ bs . naist . jp NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4763 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; P hagocytosis is a process that internalizes larger , micron - sized particles than those internalized by other endocytic pathways , such as clathrin - mediated endocytosis 1 – 3 . The plasma membrane extends and engulfs phagocytic particles . The proteins of the BAR domains have a more rigid membrane - binding surface than the membrane itself , and the architecture of this surface , that is , concave or convex , re ﬂ ects the mechanisms for membrane curvature generation 4 . The BAR domain proteins with concave membrane - binding surfaces are classi ﬁ ed as the ( N - ) BAR and F - BAR domain subfamilies and function in plasma membrane inva - ginations with submicron diameters , including clathrin - coated pits and caveolae 5 – 8 . In contrast , the I - BAR domains with convex sur - faces , such as that of IRSp53 , function to create protrusions including ﬁ lopodia 9 . Most BAR , F - BAR and I - BAR domains are thought to form membrane invaginations or protrusions by assembling into submicron - diameter ﬁ laments 10 – 12 . However , the means by which the BAR domain superfamily proteins assemble into micron - scale structures on phagocytic cups has remained unclear . GAS7 is expressed in the brain , spleen , lung , testis 13 – 15 and immune cells , including macrophages , which are capable of phagocytosis 16 , 17 . GAS7 regulates the formation of membrane protrusions in neurons 13 , 18 and invasive lung cancer cells 14 . Some receptors involved in phagocytosis are co - expressed with GAS7 according to Coxpres DB , a database of gene - expression corre - lations 19 . However , thus far , the function of GAS7 in macro - phages , cells highly capable of phagocytosis , has not been studied . In this study , we show that GAS7 plays a critical role in pha - gocytic cup formation in macrophages . Crystallographic , electron microscopic , biochemical and cellular localization analyses revealed that the GAS7 F - BAR domain possesses unique hydro - philic loops that contribute to two - dimensional sheet formation of GAS7 on ﬂ at membranes of phagocytotic cup , indicating that the sheet - like assembly of GAS7 is essential for phagocytosis . Results GAS7 splicing isoforms . To assess the possible involvement of GAS7 in phagocytosis , we examined the isoforms of GAS7 expressed in macrophages by comparing the molecular weights of various expressed , non - tagged GAS7 isoforms in HeLa cells to that of the endogenous GAS7 in RAW264 . 7 macrophages . GAS7b ( Mus musculus and Homo sapiens ) , GAS7cb ( Mus musculus ) , and GAS7c ( Homo sapiens ) are GAS7 splicing isoforms ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1a ) . In addition to the F - BAR domain , GAS7b possess a WW domain , and GAS7cb and GAS7c possesses a WW and an SH3 domain , while GAS7d contains only the F - BAR domain . As determined by western blotting , HeLa cells do not express endogenous GAS7 , while GAS7b is highly expressed in RAW264 . 7 macrophages ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . Two - dimensional assembly of GAS7 on the membrane in vitro . The F - BAR domains often bind to negatively charged membranes , where the negative charge is provided by phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and phosphoinositides , including phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - tri - sphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , which are enriched in the phagocytic cups 20 . To examine the membrane binding of GAS7 , giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) liposomes containing PS and PIP 3 were incubated with GAS7 tagged with green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) , and GAS7 assembly was observed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1a ) . The isolated F - BAR domain and GAS7b both assembled on GUVs without prominent membrane deformation or tubulation ( Fig . 1a ) . Occasionally , the F - BAR domain and GAS7b partially covered the surfaces of GUVs . The amount of GAS7 on the partially covered surface increased in a time - dependent manner , suggesting that the GAS7 assembly continued on the GAS7 - bound membrane ( Fig . 1b ) . Interestingly , the regions of GUVs without GAS7 were later completely covered by GAS7 , with the progression at the edges of the GAS7 assembly . Therefore , these results suggested that the binding of GAS7 to the membrane occurs at the pre - existing assemblies of GAS7 on the membrane . To understand GAS7 assembly on the membrane in detail , we prepared ﬂ at membranes by forming monolayered phospholipids on the grid for electron microscopic observations 21 , 22 . We observed GAS7 on lipid monolayers by electron microscopy ( Fig . 1c ) . The monolayers showed the striations formed by the GAS7 F - BAR domain , GAS7b and GAS7cb , all of which indicated the sheet - like GAS7 assemblies with striations similar to each other on the membrane ( Fig . 1c ) . Consistent with the possible multiple assembly sites of GAS7 on GUVs , there were multiple striations of GAS7 in random directions , suggesting that there are large numbers of GAS7 assemblies on the membrane . The apparent pitches of striation were ~ 5 nm , as estimated by the Fourier transform of the images ( Fig . 1d , e ) . These striations were not resulted from the membrane because the striation was not observed without protein ( Fig . 1c ) , suggesting the higher order assembly of GAS7 by its F - BAR domain , as shown for FBP17 and CIP4 on the ﬂ at membrane 10 . Structure of the GAS7 F - BAR domain . To understand the functions of GAS7 , we determined the crystal structure of the GAS7 F - BAR domain , using the crystals of an F - BAR fragment and GAS7cb ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 1d , Supplementary Table 1 ) . In the crystals of GAS7cb , only the F - BAR domain was visible in the electron density maps . The structures of the F - BAR domains in both crystals were almost identical , with a root mean square deviation of 1 . 2 Å . The GAS7 F - BAR domain forms a helical - bundle dimer with a shallow concave curvature , which is one of the ﬂ attest curvatures amongst the known F - BAR domains ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . The asymmetric unit of the F - BAR domain crystal contained two F - BAR dimers . These dimers interacted with their symmetry - related dimers , forming ﬁ lamentous oligomers with asymmetric ﬂ at surfaces , which we refer to as ﬂ at ﬁ lamentous oligomers ( FFOs ) ( Fig . 2b ) . The two FFOs formed by the different dimers in the asymmetric unit were essentially identical to each other . The FFOs had a width of ~ 14 nm with a ~ 5 nm distance between adjacent F - BAR dimers , while the F - BAR dimers were ~ 22 nm in length . The lateral alignment of F - BAR domains in FFO appeared to be similar to the pitch of the GAS7 striations on the monolayered membrane ( Fig . 1d , e ) . In the GAS7cb crystals , the periodicity observed on the monolayered membrane appeared to be absent ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Therefore , the GAS7 striations on the membrane might be formed by the assembly of the FFOs . In CIP4 and FBP17 , the contacts between the F - BAR domains in the crystals were consistent with those on the membrane 23 . We hypothesized that the GAS7 ﬁ lament in the crystal could have physiological relevance , including membrane binding . Therefore , we considered the possible positions of the WW and SH3 domains of GAS7 on this ﬁ lament . The WW and SH3 domains might be positioned on one side of the FFO , because there are huge spaces between the domains for the linker region between the F - BAR and the WW domain to pass through , as shown hypothetically in Fig . 2c . FFL2 interacts with the membrane without insertion . The striations on the monolayered membrane suggested the possible formation of FFOs , as in the crystal . The FFOs of the F - BAR domain in the crystals appeared to be mediated by two GAS7 - speci ﬁ c loops , ﬁ lament forming loop 1 ( FFL1 ) ( aa 171 – 197 ; GAS7cb amino - acid residue numbers ) and ﬁ lament forming loop ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4763 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 2 ( FFL2 ) ( aa 206 – 219 ) , which are located on the convex and concave surfaces , respectively ( Fig . 2a , d , Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . The positions of the two FFL1s and FFL2s are symmetrical ; however , one of the two FFL1s at the convex surface of the dimer interacted with the tip of the adjacent dimer , and one of the two FFL2s at the concave surface of the dimer interacted with a conserved region on the convex surface of the adjacent dimer in the FFO , thus tilting the helix bundle relative to the plane of the FFO ( Fig . 2d , Supplementary Fig . 2d – f ) . Due to asymmetry , one side of the ﬂ at surfaces of the FFO is more positively charged than the other ( Fig . 2e ) . Thus , we supposed that this surface could be the membrane - binding surface . These contacts in the FFO were unique and did not resemble any interactions used for oligomer formation by other BAR , I - BAR and F - BAR domains , including the Pinkbar I - BAR domain , which also forms a planar oligomer ( Supplementary Fig . 2g ) localized close to the cell – cell contacts 24 . 10 μ m 5 μ m PS GUV PS GUV + GFP - GAS7b PS GUV + GFP - GAS7 F - BAR PIP 3 GUV + GFP - GAS7b PIP 3 GUV R hoda m i ne - PE ( G U V ) G F P - G AS 7 GAS7 F - BAR + monolayered membrane GAS7 F - BAR + monolayered membrane Monolayered membrane GAS7b + monolayered membrane GAS7b GAS7b D207R + monolayered membrane GAS7cb + monolayered membrane 100 nm G r a y v a l ue 80 60 40 20 0 0 50 100 150 200 Distance ( pixels ) 250 0 20 nm 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 ( s ) d c b a e NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4763 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 3 One of the two FFL2s lacks contacts with the adjacent dimer and protrudes from the FFO surface ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , suggesting the direct contact of the FFL2 with the membrane . Moreover , the FFL2s are mostly composed of hydrophilic residues ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . The membrane binding of GAS7 was then experimentally examined using GAS7b , the isoform highly expressed in macrophages , by a liposome co - sedimentation assay . Referring to the other BAR domain studies , we used liposomes reconstituted from bovine brain Folch fraction lipids 23 , 25 , 26 , which contained a high amount of PS . GAS7b bound to the PS and PIP 3 containing reconstituted liposomes equally well , con ﬁ rming the relatively low sensitivity to the negatively charged phospholipid species , as also shown by GUV - binding experiments ( Fig . 2f , Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . The replacement of Gln212 at the tip of FFL2 with Arg ( Q212R ) did not alter the membrane interaction under the physiological salt conditions , but strengthened the membrane binding at a modestly higher salt concentration that reduced the electrostatic interaction ( Fig . 2g , h , Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) . Given that the introduction of Arg to the tip of FFL2 promoted the membrane binding , it appeared to be unlikely that this loop is inserted into the membrane , as in the case of the ‘ wedge loop ’ of the F - BAR domains of PACSINs 27 , 28 , which contains more hydrophobic residues , especially at the tip of the loop . To examine the importance of FFL2 , we analysed its deletion mutants . The binding of GAS7b Δ FFL2 mutants to liposomes consisting of the brain Folch fraction was weaker than that of GAS7b ( Fig . 2k , Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . There are several positively charged amino - acid residues on FFL2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . The replacement of Lys209 with Glu and that of Lys208 and Lys209 with Ala both resulted in reduced binding to liposomes consisting of brain Folch lipids and to reconstituted liposomes containing PS ( Fig . 2i , j , Supplementary Fig . 4e , f ) . These data indicated that the positively charged residues of FFL2 play a crucial role in the membrane binding of GAS7 through electrostatic interactions , again supporting the non - insertion of FFL2 into the membrane . The above mutants indicated the importance of FFL2 for the membrane binding of GAS7 ; however , the role of FFL2 in FFO formation was not addressed . The FFLs and tips are the most ﬂ exible parts of the F - BAR dimer , as shown by the molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation , although their con ﬁ gurations relative to the α - helix bundle did not change during the simulation ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . Asn177 of FFL1 and Asp207 of FFL2 were in contact with Arg326 on helix α 2b ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 3c ) , suggesting that these residues stabilized the con ﬁ guration of the FFLs . The replacement of Asp207 with Arg , which increases the positive charge , was expected to increase the membrane binding simultaneously with the FFL2 destabilization by removing its interaction with the α - helix bundle . Interestingly , GAS7b and the D207R mutant exhibited similar binding to reconstituted liposomes containing PS , as examined by a co - sedimentation assay ( Fig . 2l , Supplementary Fig . 4g ) . To examine the oligomer formation of GAS7 , we treated GAS7b with chemical cross - linkers . Highly cross - linked GAS7b was observed after the treatment with chemical cross - linkers as a mobility shift in electrophoresis , which suggested the trimer or tetramer formation by GAS7 , although the larger oligomers of GAS7 shown in the FFO model were not easily resolved by electrophoresis ( Fig . 2m ) . In the presence of the liposomes , the increase in the oligomer bands of GAS7b were observed , suggesting the promotion of oligomer formation on the membrane . The D207R mutant exhibited fewer oligomer bands than GAS7b in the electrophoresis after the chemical cross - linking reaction in the presence of the liposomes , suggesting that the oligomerization of the D207R mutant was different from that of GAS7b ( Fig . 2m , Supplementary Fig . 4h ) . Consistently , the striations of D207R mutant on the membrane were different and reduced from those of GAS7b ( Fig . 1c ) . Because the increase of arginine would strengthen the binding to the membrane , the D207R mutation was thought to compensate for the reduction in the oligomerization that would contribute to the membrane binding , suggesting the reason of the membrane binding of the D207R mutant similar to that of GAS7b . Therefore , the GAS7 oligomer formation on the membrane appeared to be promoted over that in the solution , where the con ﬁ guration of FFL2 was suggested to be important for the adequate oligomerization of GAS7 . The membrane - binding surface of the GAS7 F - BAR domain . The N - surface is perpendicular to the dimer axes , and corre - sponds to the concave surfaces of the BAR and F - BAR domains and the convex surface of the I - BAR domain ( Fig . 2b ) 29 . The N - surface in these domains often contains more conserved residues than those in the other surfaces , and is the membrane - binding surface for most BAR , F - BAR and I - BAR domains 23 . However , the concave N - surface of the GAS7 F - BAR domain dimer is less conserved than the other surfaces ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . This is in striking contrast to the other F - BAR domains , such as CIP4 and FBP17 , with membrane - binding surfaces containing numerous highly conserved residues 23 . Thus , the N - surface may not be the membrane - binding surface of GAS7 , in agree - ment with the asymmetry of the F - BAR in the FFO model ( Fig . 2b ) . FFL1 is thought to be distant from the membrane , when membrane binding through the N - surface is assumed . Therefore , we examined the membrane binding of the deletion mutant of FFL1 . The binding of the GAS7b Δ FFL1 mutant to liposomes consisting of brain Folch lipids was weaker than that of GAS7b ( Fig . 2g , Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . This af ﬁ nity reduction suggested that interaction sites other than the N - surface are involved in the membrane binding of GAS7 . Indeed , if we assume the FFO model , then this result is reasonable , as FFL1 is thought to be a critical interaction site for oligomer formation . The membrane binding of GAS7 is likely to be mediated by electrostatic interactions . Therefore , the positively charged Fig . 1 Membrane binding by GAS7 as the ﬂ at two - dimensional sheet . a Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) were incubated with 0 . 5 µ M GFP - GAS7 F - BAR domain fragment or GAS7b .

When these residues were both replaced with glutamate , membrane binding was abolished ( Fig . 2g , Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , further suggesting the membrane binding of GAS7 through the FFO surface . The assembly and the membrane localization of GAS7 were examined in HeLa cells , which do not express any isoforms of endogenous GAS7 ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) and therefore could be a good model system to examine the assembly of GAS7 within cells .

The GAS7 localization on the membrane was apparently different from those of other plasma membrane - localized BAR domains with the ability to bind to relatively ﬂ at membranes , such as Pinkbar I - BAR and the Nwk ortholog FCHSD1 F - BAR 24 , 30 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Interestingly , the patches excluded the palmitoylated DsRed - monomer ( DsRed - membrane ) , a diffusive plasma membrane marker , suggesting that the patches were sheets composed of highly concentrated GAS7b and GAS7 F - BAR ( Fig . 3a , Supple - mentary Fig . 5a ) . The patch formation was abolished by the membrane - binding de ﬁ cient Δ FFL1 , Δ FFL2 and K370E / R374E mutations , whereas the membrane - binding Q212R mutant formed patches ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . The D207R mutation abolished patch formation ( Fig . 3a ) , which was thought to be consistent with the altered oligomer formation in vitro ( Fig . 2m ) . Thus , the defect in the FFL2 - mediated oligomer formation is thought to be essential for patch formation . We also mutated the other positively charged residues . The K312E / K313E and K316E / K317E mutants did not exhibit the assembly , in contrast to the K279E / K280E and K449E / K450E mutants ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . The effective mutations are located between the side and the N - surface of the F - BAR domain dimer structure , suggesting that the FFO surface or a similar one is the membrane - binding surface ( Fig . 2e , Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . GAS7b assembly on the plasma membrane for phagocytosis . In HeLa cells , the GAS7 F - BAR domain fragment patches sometimes showed invaginations with micro - size diameters , suggesting the possible membrane deformation by the F - BAR domain ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5a ) . When GAS7b was expressed and observed in live cells , the GAS7b patches appeared at ruf ﬂ ed membranes ( Fig . 3b ) and eventually transformed into holes reminiscent of phagocytosis ( Fig . 3c ) . Therefore , we examined the localization of GAS7b in RAW264 . 7 macrophages . An incubation with zymosan , a phagocytic substrate derived from a yeast protein – carbohydrate complex , induced phagocytic cup formation with localized GFP - tagged GAS7b ( Fig . 3d ) , which was expressed in GAS7 - knockout RAW264 . 7 macrophages at a similar level to the endogenous GAS7b ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy revealed the accumulation of endogenous GAS7b with actin ﬁ laments at phagocytic cups surrounding the zymosan particles ( Fig . 3e ) . N - WASP and Arp3 , a binding partner of GAS7 for actin polymerization and a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex responsible for the N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization 13 , 14 , colocalized with GAS7b ( Fig . 3f , g ) . Receptors for phagocytosis , such as complement receptor CR3 component CD11b 31 and mannose receptor CD206 32 , also colocalized with GAS7b at phagocytic cups ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . The phagocytic activity of the RAW264 . 7 macrophage cells with the reduced expression or knockout of GAS7 was examined , using zymosan . The zymosan uptake was reduced in both GAS7 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - treated and GAS7 - knockout cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7c – e ) . IgG - coated bead uptake was also reduced in GAS7 - knockout cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7f ) . Con - sistent with the localization of GAS7 at lamellipodia , the GAS7 - knockout cells were defective in lamellipodia formation ( Supple - mentary Fig . 7g , h ) . The zymosan phagocytosis was rescued by the endogenous - level forced expression of GAS7b and GAS7cb in the knockout cells , but not by the GAS7b Δ FFL2 mutant or the F - BAR domain fragments ( Fig . 3h , i , Supplementary Fig . 7i ) . Neither the D207R nor K209E mutant restored phagocytosis , indicating that the oligomerization and the membrane binding of GAS7 were essential for the phagocytic cup formation ( Fig . 3h , j ) . Similar GAS7b assemblies on membrane in vitro and in cells . The assemblies of GAS7b on GUVs , in HeLa cells , and in mac - rophage cells were compared by ﬂ uorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . On the GUVs , both the F - BAR domain fragment and GAS7b exhibited slow turnovers , although GAS7b exhibited slightly faster recovery after photobleaching ( Fig . 3k , Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . Similarly , the GAS7b within a patch in HeLa cells exhibited slower turnover than the GAS7b in the cytosol , but the turnover of the F - BAR domain fragment was slower than that of the GAS7b in a patch ( Fig . 3l , Supplementary Fig . 8d – f ) . Interestingly , the GAS7b in the phagocytic cups of macrophages exhibited a similar turnover to that in the GAS7b patches formed in HeLa cells , suggesting similar GAS7b assem - blies in these cells ( Fig . 3l , Supplementary Fig . 8c , d ) . Next , the assembly of GAS7b at the single - molecule resolution on membranes was visualized and compared with a simulated GAS7b localization ( Fig . 4a ) . The localization was determined using GAS7b tagged with mEOS4b , a photoconvertible ﬂ uorescent protein that enables stochastic observations for super - resolution imaging 33 . The mEOS4b - GAS7b bound to GUVs ( Fig . 4b , c ) became localized to phagocytic cups , and rescued phagocytosis in GAS7 - knockout cells ( Fig . 4d , e , Supplementary Fig . 7i ) . GAS7b assembled into sheets , possibly by the alignment of the FFOs on the lipid monolayer ( Fig . 1c ) . Thus , we created a model of the GAS7b sheet that resembles the electron microscopic observations of the lateral alignment of the FFOs ( Fig . 4a ) . The assembly of mEOS4b - GAS7b was then examined by comparing the occurrence of neighbouring molecules , with random localizations and simulated FFO sheets ( Fig . 4a ) . The occurrences of the observed neighbours of GAS7b on liposomes and on the top of phagocytic cups were similar to each other , and more frequent than those of the non - speci ﬁ cally adsorbed GAS7b on the glass and the bottoms of the phagocytic cups ( Fig . 4f – i ) . Furthermore , the GAS7b Fig . 2 Crystal structures of GAS7 and the membrane - binding sites . a Ribbon diagrams of the crystal structure of the isolated GAS7 F - BAR domain and the GAS7 - speci ﬁ c N - terminal region including FFL1 ( red ) and FFL2 ( orange ) .

Interestingly , these GAS7b signals were sometimes aligned adjacent to each other ( Fig . 4g , i ) . These data support the proposal that the GAS7 assembly into sheets occurs on both liposomes and phagocytic cups . Discussion Most BAR domain superfamily proteins are involved in the gen - eration of membrane structures with submicron diameters , including clathrin - coated pits , caveolae , ﬁ lopodia , endosomes and so on , through their membrane - binding abilities 6 , 34 .

Lamellipodia contain the I - BAR domain protein IRSp53 35 , as well as the F - BAR domain proteins CIP4 36 , FBP17 37 , srGAP1 - 4 38 and FCHSD1 / 2 / Nwk 30 . Cell – cell junctions contain the I - BAR domain protein PinkBAR 24 . The relatively ﬂ at membrane before endocytosis contains FCHSD1 / 2 39 and FCHo1 / 2 40 . However , the means by which the BAR superfamily proteins form two - dimensional oligomers on these structures have remained enig - matic . Phagocytic cups are considered to be analogous structures to lamellipodia 1 , 41 – 43 . The studies of the BAR domain superfamily members involved in phagocytic cup formation have been limited to FBP17 in macrophages 44 , IBARa in dictyostelium 45 and Bin2 in leucocytes 46 . None of these proteins has been suggested to form a two - dimensional oligomeric assembly in the phagocytic cup . Our data now indicate that the GAS7b sheet formation is critical in the membrane deformation during phagocytosis . We showed that the N - surface is unlikely to be the membrane - binding surface of the GAS7 F - BAR domain upon the oligomer formation . Instead , GAS7 F - BAR likely binds to the membrane through the surface close to the side surface . The side surface was previously shown to be used by the F - BAR domain of FBP17 to bind to the ﬂ at membrane , presumably before it deformed the membrane into a tubular shape by binding through the concave N - surface 10 . GAS7 did not induce signi ﬁ cant membrane defor - mation when it bound to ﬂ at membranes under our conditions . This might arise from the membrane binding preferentially on the side surface of the F - BAR domain , as determined by the mutagenesis analysis ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Although GAS7 alone did not induce prominent membrane deformation of the already micron - sized GUVs , GAS7 F - BAR in HeLa cells was localized at micron - sized , cup - like assemblies ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Therefore , the GAS7 F - BAR domain itself might parti - cipate in micron - sized relatively ﬂ at membrane remodelling , under as yet unidenti ﬁ ed conditions . Most membrane structures involving BAR superfamily proteins are accompanied by Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymeriza - tion . The SH3 domains in the BAR superfamily proteins bind to the WASP family proteins , including N - WASP and WAVE , which then activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . GAS7b binds to N - WASP with the WW domain , and GAS7cb has the SH3 domains in addition to the WW domain 13 , 14 . These domains bind to N - WASP , thus regulating the Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization 47 – 49 . The F - BAR domain alone failed to rescue phagocytosis , suggesting the requirement of the WW domain in GAS7b to support phagocytosis . The membrane binding of GAS7 was also essential , as the proteins with mutations in the F - BAR domain , which inhibited membrane binding , also failed to restore phagocytosis . Therefore , the WASP family protein - mediated actin dynamics regulation may cooperate with GAS7 for phagocytic cup formation . The formation of pha - gocytic cups is considered to share mechanisms with lamellipodia , Arp2 / 3 - dependent protrusive structures for cell migration , in which the Arp2 / 3 complex regulators including N - WASP play a sig - ni ﬁ cant role . The Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin polymerization is also necessary for phagocytic cup formation 50 . Interestingly , GAS7 - knockout cells exhibited defects in lamellipodia formation , indi - cating that GAS7 is part of the shared mechanisms between pha - gocytosis and lamellipodia formation , including actin dynamics regulation 41 , 43 . The BAR domain superfamily proteins assemble on the mem - brane and activate N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization 47 – 49 . The high - density assembly of the BAR superfamily proteins on the membrane results in the accumulation of other domains , includ - ing the WW and SH3 domains , to near milli - molar concentra - tions . The electron microscopic and super - resolution analyses support such a high concentration of GAS7 on the membrane . The actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex is enhanced by the highly concentrated N - WASP - binding domains on the membranes 49 , 51 . Further analyses will clarify how GAS7 sheet formation and actin polymerization cooperatively regulate mem - brane deformation during phagocytosis . Methods Gene cloning , protein puri ﬁ cation and crystallization . Mouse GAS7cb ( Gen - Bank accession XM _ 006532202 . 1 ) was cloned from a mouse brain complementary DNA library by PCR . The primers used in this study were listed in Supplementary Table 2 . The DNA sequences encoding the F - BAR domains of mouse GAS7cb ( 166 – 476 aa ) and GAS7cb ( 1 – 476 aa ) were cloned into the pCold II vector ( Takara Bio , Japan ) , using the Bam HI and Sal I restriction sites to include an N - terminal af ﬁ nity tag ( His 6 ) . To express the selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - substituted protein , Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) strain JM109 ( Takara Bio ) was transformed with the expression plasmid for the F - BAR domain .

The crystals of the F - BAR domain ( 13 . 3 mgml − 1 ) were grown using the vapour - diffusion method , by 1 : 1 mixing of the protein solution with a reservoir composed of 12 % PEG 4000 , 4 % PEG 8000 , 0 . 16M ammonium sulphate , 80mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 20 mM MES ( pH 6 . 5 ) . The E . coli strain Rosetta 2 was transformed with the expression plasmid for GAS7cb , and the protein was overexpressed in LB medium at 15 °C . The bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 80 M NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1mM DTT and 1 mM pefablock or PMSF , and the bacteria were disrupted with an ultrasonic homogenizer .

GFP , GFP - GAS7 , mEOS4b - GAS7b and GAS7 mutants were each introduced into the pMXs vector and expressed in GAS7 - knockout cells , using a retrovirus produced by PLAT - A packaging cells 64 . The cells were then cloned and isolated using a cell sorter . Clones with GAS7 expression similar to that of the parental cells were selected , and examined for their phagocytic activity . Phagocytosis assays . Red - coloured zymosan ( Invitrogen ) or zymosan ( Sigma ) was opsonized with bovine serum albumin and incubated at 0 . 2mg ml − 1 with cells at 37°C . The cells were either subjected to live - cell imaging or ﬁ xed after 1h . Live images were obtained with a confocal microscope ( Olympus FV1000D ) at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Wild - type or GAS7 - knockout RAW264 . 7 cells grown on cover glasses were incubated with red - coloured zymosan ( Invitrogen ) or red ﬂ uorescent latex beads ( 2 μ m , Sigma ) coated with puri ﬁ ed rabbit IgG ( Sigma ) , for 1h at 37°C . The cells were washed , ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20min and mounted . Approximately 100 – 200 cells from six to seven randomly selected ﬁ elds were examined , to determine the number of incorporated particles . Immuno ﬂ uorescent staining . Cells grown on cover glasses were treated with BSA - coated zymosan beads for 30min , and then ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in the appropriate medium at room temperature for 20min . The cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) at room temperature for 20 min . The samples were blocked with 3 % BSA and 10 % goat serum in TBS con - taining 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( TBS - T ) for 1h , and then incubated with primary antibodies in Can Get Signal immunostain solution ( TOYOBO ) for 2h . After washing with TBS - T , the cells were incubated with ﬂ uorescently labelled secondary antibodies and phalloidin for 1 h . After washing , the cells were mounted using Prolong Gold ( Thermo Fisher / Invitrogen ) . The following antibodies were used : mouse anti - GAS7 ( clone 2F6 , Origene , TA501756 , 1 : 100 dilution ) ; mouse anti - integrin - α M ( clone Ox42 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 53086 , 1 : 100 ) and anti - CD206 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 376108 , 1 : 100 ) ; rabbit anti - N - WASP ( clone 30D10 , Cell Signaling , 4848 , 1 : 50 ) ; mouse anti - Arp3 ( clone FMS338 , Abcam , ab49671 , 1 : 250 ) ; rabbit anti - GFP ( MBL , 598 ) ; rat anti - GFP ( clone GF090R , Nacalai , 040080 , 1 : 1000 ) ; Alexa Fluor - conjugated highly cross - adsorbed anti - mouse or anti - rabbit antibodies ( Thermo Fisher , A - 11034 , A - 11036 , A - 21245 , A - 11029 , A - 11031 , A - 21236 , 1 : 400 ) and Alexa Fluor - conjugated phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher / Invitrogen , A12380 , 1 : 100 ) ; and CF488A - labelled anti - rat IgG antibody ( Biotium , 20023 , 1 : 400 ) . ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4763 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12738 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Images of cells were obtained using an FV1000 laser - scanning confocal microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with a ×100 NA 1 . 45 oil lens ( Olympus ) at room temperature . Western blotting . After SDS - PAGE , the proteins in the gel were transferred onto the membrane ( Immobilon P , IPVH00010 , Merck Millipore ) by using Trans - Blot SD Semi - Dry Transfer Cell ( Bio - Rad ) . The membrane was blocked with 5 % skim milk in PBS supplemented with 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ( PBS - T ) . Then , the proteins were examined by mouse anti - GAS7 ( Origene , 2F6 , TA501756 ) , anti - actin ( Merck Millipore , MAB1501 ) , anti - GFP ( MBL , 598 ) and anti - glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 166574 ) antibodies as primary antibody at 1 : 1000 dilution , followed by the secondary antibody of anti - mouse or rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate ( Promega ) in PBS - T with 1 : 10000 dilution . The proteins were detected by 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indoryl phosphate / nitroblue tetrazolium ( Roche ) . FRAP and time - lapse imaging . Cells on coverslips were placed in the micro - scope ’ s ( FV1000 , Olympus ) humidi ﬁ ed chamber with 5 % CO 2 . The region of interest was bleached by a 473 nm laser for 1 s . The ﬂ uorescence intensities were analysed by the Image J ( NIH ) software . The ﬂ uorescence intensity before bleaching was set to 100 % . Fluorescence after bleaching was considered to be 0 % . For the analysis of lamellipodia , cells were transfected with pCAH - Lifeact - EGFP 65 using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen ) , cultured for 1 day and then cultured in glass - bottom dishes ( IWAKI ) for 1 day . Time - lapse imaging was performed using an FV1000 ( Olympus ) laser - scanning confocal microscope at 30s intervals . Super - resolution microscopy observation . The photoconvertible ﬂ uorophore , mEOS4b , was used because it can be converted to a red ﬂ uorescent protein by ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation , even after ﬁ xation 33 . For the observation of mEOS4b - GAS7b on liposomes , 50 μ l portions of liposomes , composed of 0 . 125 mg ml − 1 lipids with 1 % of biotin - PE ( Avanti ) in 300 mM sucrose , were placed on glass - bottom dishes coated with streptavidin and biotin - BSA for immobilization , as described previously 37 . The liposomes were overlaid with 10 μ l of 4 μ M mEOS4b - GAS7b in 10mM Tris buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) , containing 150 mM NaCl and 1mM EDTA , and sandwiched with a cover glass . After 15min at room temperature , the lipo - somes were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in HEPES - buffered saline for 20 min . GAS7 - knockout RAW264 . 7 cells expressing mEOS4b - GAS7b were cultured on glass coverslips and incubated with zymosan for 1h . The cells were then ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde with 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde ( electron microscopy grade ) in HEPES - buffered saline , containing 30 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM NaCl and 2mM CaCl 2 for 20min . The ﬁ xed samples were reduced with PBS ( 0 . 1 % NaBH 4 ) for 5min . The samples were then stored in PBS with 1 % polyvinyl alcohol and 10 mM cysteamine ( MEA ) . The samples were sealed with a 1 : 1 : 1 vaseline lanolin paraf ﬁ n mixture or vaseline and then imaged using the N - STORM setup with an iXon DU - 897E electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( Andor ) . The images were recorded with the NIS - elements software version 4 . 60 . 00 and N - STORM version 4 . 0 . 0 . 215 , using the 3D - STORM mode . Images ( 10 ×10 5 ) were acquired continuously with a 12mW 543 nm laser , with continuous activation by a 405 nm laser . mEOS4b emits stochastic signals as it is converted from green to red by UV or violet light activation 66 – 68 . Red signals were erased upon observation by the 543 nm laser . Super - resolution microscopy data analysis . Each single - molecule localization was analysed using the NIS - elements software provided by Nikon . Signals in the same pixel ( 160nm square ) in continuous images were considered to be derived from the same molecule and then merged . The xy drifts between z stacks were collected , using either ﬁ ducial markers or autocorrelation between images . The coordinates of the signals were exported and drift corrected using ThunderSTORM 69 . The visualization of molecules was performed using the MATLAB software ( Mathworks ) . Molecule localization was shown by the probabilities of the mixed Gaussian distribution of the signals , where the accuracy of each signal was used as the deviation ( sigma ) for the mixed Gaussian distribution . The deviation in the depth direction ( z ) was set to be twice that in the focal plane ( xy ) . The randomness of the signals was analysed using MATLAB with a modi ﬁ ed Ripley ’ s k function analysis 70 . The region of interest was selected , and the distances of the observed signals to their neighbours were calculated using the three - dimensional coordinates of the signals . The frequency of the neighbours in 5nm step distances was calculated ( i . e . , the numbers of neighbours from 5 × i to 5 ( i + 1 ) nm distances from a signal were counted , i = 2 – 9 ) . The same number of randomly placed signals was generated as simulations , which were used for determining the fold increase in the observed neighbours as compared to the neighbours of random signals . The random signals were simulated 20 times , and these frequencies of neighbours were used to estimate the fold increases in the number of observed neighbours , as shown with ±SD . Frequencies below 10 nm distances were not shown because of the small number of signals , which result in a large variance in the fold increase . The simulation for the comparison to the observed super - resolution signals was performed using the same number of signals as that of the observed signals to be compared . The simulated dimers were generated by pairs of labels with a distance of 11 nm . The simulated FFOs were the string of dimers with a spacing of 5nm and a 40° tilt , as in the FFOs in the crystal . To generate the simulated FFO sheets , the FFOs were aligned in parallel , but the anti - parallel alignments gave almost identical results in the comparison . In total , 40 % of the molecules were considered to form sheets , whereas the rest of the molecules were random dimers . We estimated the averaged concentration of the proteins and the number of proteins in the cells by western blotting using the puri ﬁ ed GAS7b as the standard , and these values were compared with the total number of signals in RAW264 . 7 cells . Consequently , 10 % of the labels were assumed to be observed . Each signal had an accuracy of 20nm in the simulation . Statistical analyses . All data are expressed as the mean ±SD , as indicated in the legends . Data for each condition were obtained from at least three independent experiments . Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and Stu - dent ’ s t test . A value of P < 0 . 05 was considered signi ﬁ cant . Reporting summary .
