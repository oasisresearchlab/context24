Noninvasive Evaluation of Wall Shear Stress on Retinal Microcirculation in Humans Taiji Nagaoka and Akitoshi Yoshida P URPOSE . To evaluate wall shear stress ( WSS ) on retinal micro - circulation noninvasively . M ETHODS . Retinal vessel diameter ( D ) and mean centerline blood velocity ( V max , mean ) were measured in the retinal arte - rioles and venules at ﬁrst - and second - order branches in 13 subjects using laser Doppler velocimetry ( LDV ) . Retinal blood ﬂow ( RBF ) and wall shear rate ( WSR ) were calculated using these two parameters . Blood viscosity at the calculated shear rate was also measured using a cone - plate viscometer . WSS was calculated as the product of the WSR and the blood viscosity . R ESULTS . In the ﬁrst - order branches , the averaged D , V max , mean , RBF , and WSR mean were 108 (cid:1) 13 (cid:1) m , 41 (cid:1) 10 mm / s , 11 (cid:1) 4 (cid:1) L / min , and 1539 (cid:1) 383 s – 1 in the arterioles and 147 (cid:1) 13 (cid:1) m , 23 (cid:1) 3 mm / s , 12 (cid:1) 4 (cid:1) L / min , and 632 (cid:1) 73 s – 1 in the venules , respectively . The apparent blood viscosities at the measured shear rates were 3 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 3 centipoise ( cP ) in the arterioles and 3 . 8 (cid:1) 0 . 4 cP in the venules . Therefore , the averaged WSS was 54 (cid:1) 13 dyne / cm 2 in the arterioles and 24 (cid:1) 4 dyne / cm 2 in the venules . The WSS in the second - order arterioles was signiﬁ - cantly lower than that in the ﬁrst - order branches ( P (cid:2) 0 . 002 ) , but the WSS in the ﬁrst - order venules was similar to that in the second - order venules . C ONCLUSIONS . The authors demonstrated that the WSS in the retinal vessels could be evaluated noninvasively in humans using LDV and cone - plate viscometry . This system may be useful for further clinical investigation of the role of shear stress in the pathogenesis of various retinal disorders . ( Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2006 ; 47 : 1113 – 1119 ) DOI : 10 . 1167 / iovs . 05 - 0218 A blood vessel is exposed to two main stress components ; one is the local ( pulsatile ) blood pressure , which is ex - pressed as circumferential stress , and the other is the tangential stress exerted by the ﬂow of blood across the endothelial cells of the arterial wall , a mechanical entity known as wall shear stress ( WSS ) . The intact endothelium senses shear stress and induces changes in the luminal diameter to keep shear stress constant at a predetermined level . 1 – 3 For Newtonian ﬂuids , shear stress equals the viscosity times the wall shear rate ( WSR ) , which can be derived from the measured or estimated shape of the instantaneous velocity proﬁle across the lumen . 3 Because WSS is believed to play a key role as a ﬂuid mechanical mediator in vascular disorders , 4 it is important to evaluate the WSS in vivo in humans . How - ever , there have been few clinical studies of shear stress , especially in human microcirculation , mainly because there are no adequate noninvasive , reliable methods to assess the veloc - ity and diameter of the microvessesls , 5 especially in the arte - rioles , which mainly regulate total peripheral vascular resis - tance . The retinal vascular system is easily accessible to noninva - sive in vivo visual observation in humans . Recent population - based studies suggested that precise assessment of retinal mi - crovascular abnormalities may provide independent information regarding cerebrovascular risk . 6 , 7 We also recently reported that the retinal circulatory parameters measured by retinal laser Doppler velocimetry ( LDV ) may be associated with systemic atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery dis - ease , suggesting that the measurement of retinal circulation using LDV may be useful for the evaluation of systemic vascular disorders . 8 Recently , we showed that LDV is a reliable , nonin - vasive , and useful tool for evaluating the retinal circulation in humans by the simultaneous measurement of vessel diameter and blood velocity , which are needed to calculate shear rate . 9 The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable measure - ment system to evaluate wall shear stress in retinal vessels in humans . Because WSS is the WSR multiplied by the blood viscosity , we measured WSR and blood viscosity using retinal LDV and cone - plate viscometry to calculate the retinal WSS on retinal arterioles and venules . In addition , to examine whether WSS varies with the branching order of retinal microvessels , we examined the WSS in the ﬁrst - and second - order arteriolar and venular branches in the retinal microvascular network . M ETHODS Subjects Thirteen healthy male volunteers ( age range , 19 – 23 years ) participated in the present study . All subjects were fully informed of the proce - dures , risks , and beneﬁts of the study , and written consent was ob - tained from all subjects before the study .

The red Doppler - shifted light scattered from the ﬂowing RBCs in the retinal vessels is detected simultaneously in two directions separated by a ﬁxed angle . The signals from the two photomultiplier tube detectors undergo computer - controlled spectrum analysis , and the centerline velocity of the RBCs , which is deﬁned as V max , is sequentially measured automat - ically over 2 seconds . This device also contains systems to measure vessel diameter and to track vessels . The green stripe ( wavelength , 544 nm ) is oriented perpendicularly to the axis of the vessel . During the session , a linear imaging sensor takes 15 vessel proﬁles of the target vessel illuminated by a green laser beam every 4 milliseconds just before and after each velocity measurement . The diameter of the retinal artery is determined automatically by computer analysis of the signal produced by the arterial image on the array sensor using the half height of the trans - mittance proﬁle to deﬁne the vessel edge . 11 Further detail about the LDV system is available from our previous reports . 12 Measurement Site and Comparison of First - and Second - Order Vessels Laser Doppler measurements were obtained from a temporal retinal artery and vein in one eye of each subject . The arteries and veins chosen for measurement had relatively straight segments that were sufﬁciently distant from the adjacent vessels . We measured the retinal blood ﬂow ( RBF ) at two sites in the retinal artery and vein upstream and downstream of the ﬂow divider ( Fig . 1a ) . The major retinal arte - rioles and venules that arise from the optic disc were classiﬁed as the ﬁrst - order vessels , and the larger daughter arterioles and venules lo - cated 1 disc diameter away from the bifurcation point were chosen as the second - order vessels to avoid ﬂow disturbances by the bifurcation . This measurement was repeated 5 times with an interval of 1 minute in each subject . Measurement of Blood Viscosity On the same day as the laser Doppler examination and within a few hours of blood withdrawal from the antecubital vein , blood viscosity ( (cid:2) ) was measured in vitro at 37°C with a cone - plate viscometer ( mod - ular compact rheometer ; Physica MCR - 100 , Paar Physica , Ostﬁldern , Germany ) . Blood was anticoagulated with EDTA ( 3 . 4 mM ) . After incu - bation of 2 mL of the blood sample for 5 minutes in a 37°C water bath , approximately 600 (cid:1) L well - mixed whole blood was loaded into the viscometer . Whole blood viscosity was determined over a wide range of shear rates from 1 to 6000 s – 1 by 40 discrete values ( Fig . 2 ) . Blood viscosity was expressed in centipoise . Calculations The mean centerline blood velocity ( V max , mean ) was obtained by averaging V max during one cardiac cycle . Maximum blood velocity and minimum blood velocity , which were associated with the cardiac systolic and diastolic , were indicated as V max , systolic and V max , diastolic , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . Resistive index was deﬁned as the following : Resistive index (cid:2) V max , systolic (cid:3) V max , diastolic V max , systolic F IGURE 1 .

V mean can be calculated as V max , mean / 2 from the assumption of Poiseuille ﬂow , 13 , 14 especially for tubes larger than 80 (cid:1) m 15 and for blood velocity greater than 11 mm / s . 16 In addition , it was conﬁrmed recently that the RBF is laminar ﬂow away from the bifur - cation point . 17 Maximum and minimum WSR and WSS were expressed as WSR systolic , WSR diastolic , WSS systolic , and WSS diastolic . WSR and WSS were represented as the units seconds (cid:3) 1 ( see Refs . 9 , 18 ) and dyne / cm 2 ( see Ref . 19 ) , respectively . Because ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) was determined by the formula OPP (cid:2) 2 / 3MABP - IOP , 20 the retinal arterial vascular resistance ( RVR ) can be determined from the following 21 : RVR (cid:3) OPP / RBF ( 4 ) Only RVR of ﬁrst - order arterioles could be obtained because signiﬁcant resistance was generated by ﬁrst - order arterioles . We derived retinal blood viscosity from cone - plate viscosity based on retinal WSR values . However , because of the Fahraeus - Lindqvist effect—that is , the reduction of blood viscosity with tube diameter at tubes smaller than 0 . 2 mm , 22 the actual viscosity in the retinal mi - crovessel was calculated based on the equation described by Haynes 23 (cid:2) (cid:4) D (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:6) / (cid:4) 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:5) / D (cid:5) 2 , 19 , 23 ( 5 ) where (cid:2) (cid:6) is the apparent viscosity in a tube with a large diameter , (cid:5) is the equivalent diameter of red cells ( 6 (cid:1) m ) , 19 and D is the diameter of the blood vessel . We deﬁned the values of the apparent blood viscosity measured in vitro using a cone - plate viscometry at the measured WSR as (cid:2) (cid:6) and used the estimated values of (cid:2) ( D ) to calculate retinal WSS in the present study . Laminar ﬂow in a tube was a prerequisite concerning Poiseuille’s law . To conﬁrm laminar retinal blood ﬂow , the Reynolds number ( R e ) was calculated according to the formula R e (cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:1) V mean (cid:1) (cid:4) D / 2 (cid:5) / (cid:2) ( 6 ) where (cid:6) is the blood density ( assumed to be 1058 kg / m 3 ) , 24 V mean is the mean velocity of the blood ( in meters per second ) , D is the vessel diameter ( in millimeters ) , and (cid:2) is the blood viscosity ( in centipoise ) . A Reynolds number value less than 1000 is considered characteristic of laminar ﬂow . 25 Reproducibility and Reliability of LDV Measurement To evaluate the reproducibility of the LDV system , we calculated the average coefﬁcient of variation ( CV ) ( 100 [ SD / mean ] ; mean (cid:1) SD ) . We obtained ﬁve values from the same vessel at every minute in 5 minutes , averaged them in each subject , and calculated the CV in each vessel in each subject . To demonstrate conservation of ﬂow in the retinal mi - crovessels using the LDV system , we examined the relation of RBF between ﬁrst - order ( parent ) vessel and the sum of two second - order ( daughter ) vessels . Statistical Analysis All data are expressed as mean (cid:1) SD . Differences between the ﬁrst - and second - order branches in the retinal arterioles or venules were ana - lyzed using the Student’s paired t - test . P (cid:7) 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . R ESULTS Systemic Parameters and OPP At the beginning of the measurements , the group - averaged values of the systolic , diastolic , and mean blood pressures were 119 (cid:1) 13 , 63 (cid:1) 7 , and 82 (cid:1) 8 mm Hg , respectively . Since the mean IOP was 15 (cid:1) 2 mm Hg in our subjects , the group - averaged values of the OPP were calculated to be 40 (cid:1) 6 mm Hg . Reproducibility and Reliability of LDV System Table 1 shows the reproducibility of the measurement of ret - inal circulatory parameters in the ﬁrst - and second - order ves - sels . Variations were small for vessel diameter in arterioles and venules . CVs from V max , mean , V max , systolic , V max , diastolic , and RBF were slightly higher but almost less than 15 % . CVs ob - tained from second - order vessels were similar to those from F IGURE 2 . Averaged values of blood viscosity obtained from cone - plate viscometry in 13 healthy volunteers . T ABLE 1 .

In addition , clear , representative velocity waveforms were obtained from ﬁrst - and second - order arte - rioles in all subjects ( Fig . 1b ) . In 8 of 13 subjects , we obtained the retinal circulatory parameters in ﬁrst - and second - order vessels . We excluded the data obtained from 5 subjects whose second - order vessels were smaller than 60 (cid:1) m in diameter because of the insufﬁ - cient reliability of measurement . 12 In these 8 subjects , the average values of RBF of ﬁrst - order and daughter second - order vessels were 11 . 5 (cid:1) 2 . 3 , 6 . 9 (cid:1) 1 . 8 , and 4 . 4 (cid:1) 1 . 2 (cid:1) L / min in arterioles and 12 . 0 (cid:1) 1 . 9 , 7 . 1 (cid:1) 1 . 1 , and 4 . 7 (cid:1) 2 . 0 (cid:1) L / min in venules , respectively . Sums of the RBF in both second - order vessels were almost equal to those from ﬁrst - order vessels . In addition , the RBF in the ﬁrst - order vessels was strongly corre - lated with the sum of RBF in second - order vessels in arterioles ( r (cid:2) 0 . 94 ) and venules ( r (cid:2) 0 . 98 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Retinal Circulatory Parameters in First and Second Branches Vessel diameters measured in the present study ranged from 89 . 3 to 137 . 3 (cid:1) m in ﬁrst - order and from 80 . 1 to 132 . 0 (cid:1) m in second - order arterioles and from 126 . 3 to 173 . 4 (cid:1) m in ﬁrst - order and from 109 . 5 to 143 . 1 (cid:1) m in second - order venules . The group - averaged values of the D , V max , mean , RBF , and WSR mean were 107 . 9 (cid:1) 12 . 6 (cid:1) m , 41 . 1 (cid:1) 9 . 6 mm / s , 11 . 4 (cid:1) 4 . 1 (cid:1) L / min , and 1539 (cid:1) 383 s – 1 in the retinal arterioles and 147 . 3 (cid:1) 12 . 6 (cid:1) m , 23 . 3 (cid:1) 3 . 4 mm / s , 12 . 2 (cid:1) 3 . 7 (cid:1) L / min , and 632 (cid:1) 73 s – 1 in the venules of the ﬁrst - order vessels ( Table 2 ) . In the second - order branches , the D , V max , mean , RBF , and WSR mean were 100 . 6 (cid:1) 13 . 8 (cid:1) m , 27 . 7 (cid:1) 5 . 4 mm / s , 6 . 7 (cid:1) 2 . 2 (cid:1) L / min , and 1119 (cid:1) 277 s – 1 , respectively , in the retinal arte - rioles and 127 . 5 (cid:1) 9 . 9 (cid:1) m , 19 . 4 (cid:1) 4 . 3 mm / s , 7 . 6 (cid:1) 2 . 4 (cid:1) L / min , and 606 (cid:1) 115 s – 1 , respectively , in the venules . In the retinal arterioles , the vessel diameter in the ﬁrst - order branches tended to be higher than that in the second - order branches , but the difference did not reach signiﬁcance ( P (cid:2) 0 . 07 ) . There were signiﬁcant differences in V max , mean , V max , systolic , V max , diastolic , pulse amplitude , RBF , and Reynold’s number between the ﬁrst - and second - order branches in retinal arterioles ( Table 2 ) . In the retinal venules , the values of the D , V max , mean , and RBF were signiﬁcantly higher in the ﬁrst - order branches than in the second - order branches . The WSR mean in F IGURE 3 .

On the other hand , there was no signiﬁcant difference in the WSR of the retinal venules between the ﬁrst - and second - order branches ( P (cid:2) 0 . 44 ) . At the level of retinal WSR , after taking into account the Fahraeus - Lindqvist effect ( equation 5 ) , the apparent blood viscosity was 3 . 52 (cid:1) 0 . 30 cP in the ﬁrst - order arterioles and 3 . 82 (cid:1) 0 . 38 cP in the ﬁrst - order venules , respec - tively . Therefore , the retinal WSS mean was 54 . 0 (cid:1) 13 . 2 dyne / cm 2 in the ﬁrst - order arterioles and 24 . 1 (cid:1) 3 . 5 dyne / cm 2 in the ﬁrst - order venules . The WSS mean in the second - order arterioles was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the ﬁrst - order arterioles ( P (cid:2) 0 . 002 ) , but the WSS mean in the second - order venules was similar to that in the ﬁrst - order venules . D ISCUSSION The results of the present study demonstrate that in vivo measurements of the WSS in the retinal arterioles and venules of healthy men are reliable and reproducible using a system that combines a retinal LDV measurement and the cone - plate viscometry . Our results also showed that the WSS in the retinal arteriole was about twice as high as that in the venules and that there was a difference in the WSS between the ﬁrst - and second - order branches in the retinal arterioles but not in the venules . These results suggest that the distribution of WSS is not constant in the vascular tree , at least not in the retinal microcirculation . In this study , we presented a new approach to the nonin - vasive assessment of WSS in human retinal microcirculation . The implications of Poiseuille’s law are that ﬂow is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the ﬂuid . For a Newtonian ﬂuid such as water , viscosity has been deﬁned as the ratio of shear stress to the shear rate of the ﬂuid . On the other hand , for a non - Newtonian ﬂuid such as blood , the ratio of shear stress to shear rate is not constant . Therefore , it is important to measure or estimate the apparent viscosity of the blood in the retinal microcirculation for precise evaluation of WSS in the retinal microvessels . However , few studies have been conducted of shear rate measurement in human vascular disorders because , until now , there have been no adequate , noninvasive methods to assess WSR and WSS . The ﬁrst step in estimating WSS requires velocity measure - ments . A parabolic velocity proﬁle was a critical assumption for the calculation of blood velocity and WSR in retinal microcir - culation in the present study . Recently , Logean et al . 17 showed an excellent velocity proﬁle that was very close to parabolic in retinal arterioles and venules , probably ﬁrst - order vessels . In addition , Eiju et al . 26 observed parabolic ﬂow in the rat mes - entery artery ( diameter , 40 (cid:1) m ) using high - resolution laser Doppler velocimetry . This study seems to support our assump - tion that velocity proﬁles are close to parabolic ﬂow in second - order vessels ( diameters greater than 80 (cid:1) m ) . Because a Reynolds number less than 1000 is considered characteristic of laminar ﬂow , 25 the present result—that the mean value of the Reynolds number in the retinal microcirculation was approxi - mately 1 . 0—seems to support the concept that the retinal circulation is a parabolic ﬂow . Logean et al . 17 also reported that the velocity proﬁle was still slightly blunted at ﬁve vessel diameters after bifurcation , suggesting that a sufﬁcient distance is required to reestablish steady ﬂow after a junction . Although we could not conﬁrm the velocity proﬁle was parabolic in ﬁrst - and second - order vessels in the present study , we measured the vessels that had relatively straight segments and were located 1 disc diameter upstream and downstream from the bifurcation to minimize the inﬂuence of branching on the velocity proﬁle . Taken together , it is reasonable to consider that we can analyze the present data under the assumption that the velocity proﬁle might be parabolic in the retinal microcir - culation . We examined the relation of the WSS between ﬁrst - and second - order branches in the present study . Because the reli - ability of the measurement of second - order vessels using an LDV system had not been demonstrated , we had to examine whether our system was capable of performing reliable mea - surements of retinal blood ﬂow in ﬁrst - and second - order ves - sels . The present results showed that CVs from retinal circula - tory parameter in second - order vessels were similar to those in ﬁrst - order vessels ( Table 1 ) , that a similar and representative blood velocity waveform was obtained from ﬁrst - and second - order arterioles , and that the RBF in ﬁrst - order vessels was almost equal to the sum of the RBF in both second - order daughter arterioles . Collectively , these ﬁndings suggest that WSS in the retinal microcirculation can be reliably estimated , at least in ﬁrst - and second - order retinal vessels . We used cone - plate viscometry to measure whole blood viscosity . Previous studies using cone - plate viscometry re - ported that whole blood viscosity was approximately 4 . 5 cP at a WSR of 225 s – 11 , 27 in healthy human volunteers . In our study , the estimated whole blood viscosity was 4 . 6 (cid:1) 0 . 6 cP at 225 s – 1 , suggesting that our data are similar to those reported previously . Although it was reported that the blood viscosity almost reached a plateau at a shear rate of 90 s – 1 , 25 we dem - onstrated that the blood viscosity gradually decreased by ap - proximately 30 % from 100 s – 1 ( 5 . 16 (cid:1) 0 . 93 cP ) to 3000 s – 1 ( 3 . 64 (cid:1) 0 . 30 cP ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Because WSS is a function of WSR and viscosity , the measurement of WSR and viscosity in the retinal microvessel was needed for the precise determination of WSS in the retinal microcirculation . Fahraeus and Lindqvist 22 found that the apparent viscosity at constant ﬂow rate was reduced in tubes of radii smaller than 0 . 2 mm . Therefore , we calculated the apparent blood viscosity according to equation 5 , which has been previously deﬁned . The calculated apparent viscosity , (cid:2) ( D ) , was lower than (cid:2) (cid:6) by approximately 5 % and was obtained in vitro by cone - plate viscometry ( data not shown ) . Although such a small decrease in apparent blood viscosity with the decreased vessel radius might have had little effect on the present results , it was needed to calculate the apparent blood viscosity for the reli - able evaluation of retinal WSS . Murray’s law 28 posits that shear stress on the walls of vessels is constant and equal throughout the circulatory sys - tem . 29 Kimaya et al . 19 roughly estimate the WSS in various vascular beds based on their and other studies . They found that WSS values ranged from 10 to 20 dyne / cm 2 from large artery to capillary , suggesting that WSS in the entire arterial tree and its capillary bed is controlled at an approximately constant level , probably by the same autoregulatory mechanism . However , the present results , which showed a difference in WSR and WSS between the ﬁrst - and second - order arterioles in the reti - nal microcirculation ( Table 2 ) , also suggest that shear stress does not seem to be constant throughout the vascular system in the human retinal microcirculation . Because WSS decreases with decreasing intravascular pressure in the microcircula - tion 30 and at least 50 % of the pressure gradient arises from the arterioles , 31 it is reasonable to think that intravascular pressure might be higher in ﬁrst - order arterioles than in second - order arterioles in the retinal microcirculation . Therefore , the differ - ences in WSS between ﬁrst - and second - order arterioles may be the result of differences in the intravascular pressure in retinal microcirculation . The results of the present studies also showed that half the WSS in the arterioles is exerted on the retinal venules . It is reported that shear stress ranges from 1 to 6 dyne / cm 2 in the venous system . 32 The present data—the group - averaged values IOVS , March 2006 , Vol . 47 , No . 3 Noninvasive Evaluation of Shear Stress 1117 Downloaded From : https : / / iovs . arvojournals . org / pdfaccess . ashx ? url = / data / journals / iovs / 933440 / on 11 / 21 / 2018 in the ﬁrst and second venules of 25 . 1 and 24 . 3 dyne / cm 2 , respectively , suggest that high WSS is exerted on the retinal venules compared with that in the veins in other vascular beds . Because recent in vitro studies reported that approximately 20 dyne / cm 2 of shear stress stimulates the retinal endothelial cells to release nitric oxide ( NO ) , 33 the NO released from the en - dothelium in the arterioles and the venules may play an impor - tant role in vasoregulation , especially in the retinal microcir - culation , where the retinal arterioles are adjacent to the paired venules . Because venules continuously produce NO under rest - ing conditions 34 and during hyperemia , 35 , 36 NO can diffuse to and dilate nearby paired arterioles . 37 Donati et al . 38 reported that experimental branch vein occlusion induces impaired release of constitutive NO and arteriolar constriction in the affected retina . In addition , the characteristic changes—venous bedding , looping , and duplication—in patients with diabetic retinopathy were mainly observed in retinal venules . Given that the retinal circulation is impaired in patients with diabe - tes , 39 it is important to evaluate WSS because it affects not only arterioles but also venules in the retinal circulation . In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that vessels tend to maintain constant shear stress in response to ﬂow changes , called ﬂow - mediated regulation . 2 , 40 , 41 Flow - mediated brachial artery reactivity , in which endothelium - derived NO plays an important role , is impaired in patients with overt atherosclerosis and in asymptomatic persons with risk factors for coronary disease . 42 , 43 We recently showed that the WSR increases during hypoxia using this method in anesthetized cats , suggesting that ﬂow - induced vasodilation may be in - volved in the increased RBF in response to systemic hypoxia . 9 Given that endothelium - derived NO is considered necessary to maintain adequate vascular shear stress , our system for mea - suring the retinal WSS may be useful for further investigation of endothelial function in the human microcirculation . It is now possible to estimate WSS in humans with nonin - vasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and Doppler sonography . Many studies of shear stress in hu - mans have focused on large arteries , such as the aorta , carotid artery , and brachial artery , whereas data regarding shear stress in the microcirculation seem to be rare . Previous studies showed that the values of the peak ( systolic ) and mean WSS were reported to be 27 . 2 to 54 . 0 dyne / cm 2 and 2 . 8 to 10 . 4 dyne / cm 2 in human abdominal aorta , 44 , 45 18 . 7 to 29 . 5 dyne / cm 2 and 7 . 0 to 15 . 3 dyne / cm 2 in the common carotid ar - tery , 5 , 24 , 46 , 47 and 17 . 0 dyne / cm 2 and 4 . 65 dyne / cm 2 in the brachial artery , 48 respectively . The present results—that is , the estimated peak and mean WSS of 90 . 8 and 57 . 1 dyne / cm 2 , respectively , in the ﬁrst - order retinal arteriole also revealed that the WSS in the retinal arterioles ( resistance artery ) is higher than in other tissue vascular beds , such as the aorta , carotid ( elastic artery ) , and brachial ( muscular artery ) artery . The dif - ferences in WSS between retinal and other vascular beds may be dependent on the inherent characteristics of some types of arteries . Further study is needed to investigate the clinical meaning of high shear stress in retinal vessels . The present study had some limitations . First , we measured only ﬁrst - and second - order retinal vessels . To examine how WSS distributes throughout the retinal microvascular network , we had to measure the smaller vessels further downstream . However , the instrument was limited in that measurements on vessels smaller than 60 (cid:1) m in diameter were difﬁcult to achieve . 12 Second , in the LDV system , the measurement of vessel diameter is performed by taking 15 vessel images every 4 milliseconds just before and after each velocity measure - ment . The vessel diameter measurement might have been af - fected by the pulsation . Although we cannot completely ex - clude this possibility , the CVs from 30 vessel images obtained before and after each velocity measurement , which is calcu - lated automatically in the LDV system , were less than 3 % ( data not shown ) , suggesting that there might have been little inﬂu - ence of pulsation on the shear stress calculation . Third , cor - rection factors 1 . 6 49 and 2 . 0 13 for the estimation of V mean have both been used for the calculation of retinal blood ﬂow in previous papers by different laboratories using LDV . In the present study , we used a correction factor of 2 . 0 ( V mean (cid:2) V max , mean / 2 . 0 ) , in accordance with a previous study 13 in which this issue has been discussed in detail . We could not determine the true factor to correct the centerline blood velocity ob - tained through LDV because we did not evaluate the blood velocity proﬁle in this study . Further study is needed to eluci - date which correction factor for V mean should be used for the calculation of retinal blood ﬂow . In conclusion , we demonstrated that WSS in retinal vessels could be measured in humans using a system that combines retinal LDV and cone - plate viscometry . Because decreases in the WSS in the common carotid artery and the brachial artery were previously reported in patients with diabetes 27 and hy - pertension , 48 it is possible that abnormalities of the WSS may be associated with retinal vascular disorders , such as diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy . Therefore , this system may be useful for further clinical investigation of the role of shear stress in the pathogenesis of various retinal disorders . References 1 .
