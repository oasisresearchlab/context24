Scar1 and the related Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , WASP , regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2 / 3 complex Laura M . Machesky * † and Robert H . Insall †‡ Background : The actin - related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 are part of a seven - protein complex which is localized in the lamellipodia of a variety of cell types , and in actin - rich spots of unknown function . The Arp2 / 3 complex enhances actin nucleation and causes branching and crosslinking of actin filaments in vitro ; in vivo it is thought to drive the formation of lamellipodia and to be a control center for actin - based motility . The Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , WASP , is an adaptor protein implicated in the transmission of signals from tyrosine kinase receptors and small GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton . Scar1 is a member of a new family of proteins related to WASP , and it may also have a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton . Scar1 is the human homologue of Dictyostelium Scar1 , which is thought to connect G - protein - coupled receptors to the actin cytoskeleton . The mammalian Scar family contains at least four members . We have examined the relationships between WASP , Scar1 , and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Results : We have identified WASP and its relative Scar1 as proteins that interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex . We have used deletion analysis to show that both WASP and Scar1 interact with the p21 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex through their carboxyl termini . Overexpression of carboxy - terminal fragments of Scar1 or WASP in cells caused a disruption in the localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex and , concomitantly , induced a complete loss of lamellipodia and actin spots . The induction of lamellipodia by platelet - derived growth factor was also suppressed by overexpression of the fragment of Scar1 that binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Conclusions : We have identified a conserved sequence domain in proteins of the WASP family that binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Overexpression of this domain in cells disrupts the localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex and inhibits lamellipodia formation . Our data suggest that WASP - related proteins may regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2 / 3 complex . Background Actin polymerization in lamellipodia is thought to be the driving force for much of cell motility . A complex of seven proteins , called the Arp2 / 3 complex , is thought to be an essential player in this process . The seven components of the Arp2 / 3 complex are Arp2 , Arp3 , p41 - Arc , p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc and p16 - Arc [ 1 , 2 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is localized in the lamellipodia of crawling cells , and in actin - rich spots of unknown function [ 2 , 3 ] . In vitro , the Arp2 / 3 complex can enhance the nucleation of new actin filaments [ 4 , 5 ] , and in vivo it can cause the formation of branched structures similar to those previously observed at the leading edges of moving cells [ 4 , 6 ] . Arp2 / 3 com - plexes can also cap the slow - growing ends of actin fila - ments , an observation which has implications for the turnover of actin filaments in cells [ 4 ] . The first evidence that the Arp2 / 3 complex could be important for actin - based motility in vivo came from a study showing that it is capable of initiating actin polymer - ization on the surface of the motile intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes [ 7 ] . Listeria is used as a model for actin - based cellular motility because it recruits the cytoskeletal proteins of host cells to assemble actin tails , which in turn propel it through the cytoplasm . The Arp2 / 3 complex localizes along the length of these actin tails , where it may nucleate and crosslink actin filaments [ 7 ] . It is not , however , yet known if the Arp2 / 3 complex is essen - tial for actin tail formation . Genetic studies in yeast also provide an insight into the in vivo function of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The complex local - izes to cortical actin patches and is required for their motil - ity and their polarized organization in cells [ 8 – 10 ] . Yeast actin patches are thought to be important for membrane and cell - wall deposition during cytokinesis and cell growth [ 11 ] . Both Arp2 , which is required for endocytosis [ 12 ] , and Arp3 are essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Addresses : MRC - LMCB , * Department of Molecular Medicine and ‡ Department of Physiology , University College London , Gower Street , London WC1E 6BT , UK .

The function of the Arp2 / 3 complex is also con - nected to profilin function in S . pombe , as a mutation in the p41 subunit , named SOP2 in S . pombe , can suppress a loss - of - function mutation in the gene encoding profilin which causes a block in cytokinesis [ 15 ] . This fits with studies in amoebae showing that the Arp2 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex can bind to profilin [ 16 , 17 ] . Although many of the key players in actin cytoskeletal organization have been identified , it is less clear how these proteins respond to signals from outside of the cell that induce cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility . The WASP family of proteins , including WASP , N - WASP , and recently Scar proteins , is most likely to be involved in transmitting signals from receptors to the cytoskeleton . All of these proteins are organized into several modular domains , characterized by sequence homology and binding interactions . The amino - terminal half of WASP - family proteins appears to be important for communication with receptors or small GTPases . Both WASP and N - WASP bind to activated Cdc42 and Rac through their amino - terminal CRIB domains ( a Cdc42 / Rac small GTPase binding motif ) [ 18 – 20 ] . Both WASP and N - WASP also contain amino - terminal pleck - strin homology ( PH ) domains , and at least N - WASP binds to acidic phospholipids , which may confer a plasma mem - brane localization [ 20 ] . The amino termini of Scar pro - teins are homologous to each other , but not to WASPs , and their binding interactions are unknown . The middle portions of WASP and Scar proteins contain polyproline stretches . WASP binds to proteins that contain Src homol - ogy 3 ( SH3 ) domains , such as the adaptor protein Nck , through its polyproline - containing domain [ 21 ] . Nck binds directly to the platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor and is thought to be an essential adaptor protein for relaying signals downstream of PDGF - recep - tor activation [ 22 ] . The carboxy - terminal portions of N - WASP , WASP and Scar also contain an actin - binding motif , known as the WH2 or verprolin homology domain . A conserved series of acidic residues lies carboxy - terminal to the WH2 domain . WASP family proteins are required for normal cytoskeletal function in both humans and yeast . Wiskott – Aldrich syn - drome , the genetic disease associated with mutations in the gene encoding WASP , results in a severe immune dys - function and thrombocytopenia [ 23 , 24 ] . Macrophages from patients with Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome are defec - tive in chemotaxis and show altered actin cytoskeletal morphology [ 25 ] . The S . cerevisiae WASP - related protein Las17p / Bee1p is required for cortical actin assembly [ 26 ] . Interestingly , overexpression of Las17p can compensate for some Arp2 and Arp3 mutations ( B . Winsor , personal communication ) , indicating a connection with the Arp2 / 3 complex in yeast . Scar is a Dictyostelium WASP - related protein that is con - nected with the cAMP signalling pathway that acts through the heterotrimeric G - protein - coupled receptor cAR2 [ 27 ] . Disruption of the gene encoding Scar allows Dictyostelium cells to overcome a block in development caused by a lack of cAR2 . The cells lacking Scar are much smaller than wild - type cells and have an altered cortical actin structure . It is not clear how Scar functions downstream of cAMP receptors , but one idea is that it negatively regulates a sig - nalling pathway downstream of cAR2 . Four human homo - logues of Scar have been identified in Genbank and named Hs - Scar1 – Hs - Scar4 [ 27 ] . Unlike WASP and N - WASP , Scar proteins do not contain a CRIB domain so their regu - lation is probably not directly through small GTPases . Results Scar1 and WASP bind to p21 - Arc We have sought cellular binding targets of the Arp2 / 3 complex using the yeast two - hybrid protein interaction assay [ 28 ] . We used p21 - Arc or p34 - Arc ( fused to the GAL4 DNA - binding domain ) as the ‘bait’ to ‘fish out’ proteins ( fused to the GAL4 transcription - activation domain ) from a human brain cDNA library . All of the p34 - Arc - interacting clones that we isolated encoded p20 - Arc . We found eight p21 - Arc - interacting clones , one of which encoded p20 - Arc and the remainder novel proteins . One clone showed a par - ticularly strong response in the b - galactosidase assay for activation of GAL4 transcription . This cDNA was sequenced and its sequence found to contain homology to WASP in the carboxy - terminal region , which includes the WH2 homology domain and a short acidic domain ( Figure 1a ) . It was also found to contain a sequence identical to the 3 ¢ end ( nucleotides 1330 – 1741 ) of a cDNA encoding Scar1 , a human homologue of Dictyostelium Scar1 ( Hs - Scar1 ; Genbank accession number D87459 ) . Neither the full - length sequence nor the p21 - Arc - binding fragment ( Scar - WA ; Figure 1a ) showed any interaction with the unfused pYTH6 GAL4 transcription - activation domain , p16 - Arc or p34 - Arc in the two - hybrid assay ( data not shown ) , but both showed a strong interaction with p21 - Arc , as measured by growth on 3AT plates and b - galactosidase expression ( Figure 1b ) . Because the p21 - Arc - binding region of Scar1 is homologous to WASP , we also assayed full - length WASP and an equivalent carboxy - terminal fragment ( WASP - WA ; Figure 1a ) for interaction with p21 - Arc . Both full - length WASP and the carboxy - terminal fragment of WASP bound tightly , as measured by growth on 3AT plates and expres - sion of b - galactosidase ( Figure 1b ) . To analyze the interaction between p21 - Arc and Scar1 in more detail , we made deletions in the cDNA encoding Scar1 . We named these deletion constructs according to the domains they contained : S , Scar homology ; P , polyproline ; W , WH2 WASP homology ; A , acidic . We found that the amino - terminal portion of Scar1 , up to and including the polyproline region , did not interact with 1348 Current Biology , Vol 8 No 25 p21 - Arc ( Figure 1a , b ) . Deletion of the carboxy - terminal 15 amino acids to create Scar - W also resulted in a com - plete loss of interaction with p21 - Arc ( Figure 1b ) . We conclude that amino acids 445 – 559 of Scar1 , containing the WH2 and acidic domains , bind specifically to p21 - Arc , and that the carboxy - terminal 15 amino acids , com - prising the acidic domain , are required for this interaction . The equivalent carboxy - terminal domain of WASP and full - length WASP also show a strong and spe - cific interaction with p21 - Arc in the two - hybrid assay ( Figure 1b ) . Scar1 and WASP bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex and to monomeric actin in vitro We immobilized fragments of Scar1 and WASP fused to glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) on glutathione – agarose and determined which of the constructs would bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex in porcine brain cytosol . All constructs containing the carboxy - terminal acidic domain bound to the complex ( Figure 2 ) . Scar - W , which contains the WH2 domain but not the acidic domain , bound to actin but not to the complex ( Figure 2 ) . Neither Scar - S , which contains the amino - terminal half of the molecule , nor GST alone , bound to either actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2 ) . We conclude that the acidic domain of Scar1 , containing residues 522 – 559 , is sufficient for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex but not to actin . Because Scar - A binds only to the Arp2 / 3 complex and not to actin , we conclude that actin is not required for the interaction between Scar1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex . It has previously been reported that monomeric actin can bind to WH2 homology domains ( also called verprolin Research Paper Scar1 and WASP in cytoskeletal regulation Machesky and Insall 1349 Figure 2 Scar1 and WASP fragments interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin in cytosol . Porcine brain cytosol was incubated with approximately equal amounts of GST - fused Scar1 and WASP fragments immobilized on glutathione – agarose . Western blots of approximately equal percentages of the total of supernatant and pellet fractions of binding assays were probed with antibodies to Arp3 , p34 - Arc and actin . A representative experiment is shown here . We obtained a semi - quantitative estimate of the binding from these data , assuming that the cytosolic concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex is similar to that published for Acanthamoeba [ 3 ] . Overall , the binding to actin was between 0 . 5 and 1 mole of actin per mole of Scar or WASP fragment , as estimated by scanning densitometry . Less than 1 mole of actin bound per 1000 moles of Scar - A . For the Arp2 / 3 complex , the binding was approximately 1 mole of complex per 70 moles of the Scar or WASP fragment . The estimated K d for Scar or WASP - WA with Arp2 / 3 complex from these observations is around 150 nM .

All of our GST constructs containing a WH2 domain from Scar1 or from WASP bound to actin ( Figure 2 ) . We further explored this actin binding by testing whether purified monomeric and filamentous actin bound to Scar - WA . We found that GST – Scar - WA bound to monomeric actin but GST – Scar - S did not ( Figure 3a ) . We also tested the ability of Scar - WA to bind to , or depolymerize , filamentous actin . Because it was previously reported that an N - WASP - WA fragment could depolymerize actin filaments [ 20 ] , we thought that Scar - WA might also have this activity . We found that , even with incubation times of up to 4 hours , there was no detectable interaction between Scar - WA and filamentous actin and no detectable depolymerization ( Figure 3b ) . If we added increasing concentrations of Scar - WA to polymerized actin , we could see a decrease in fila - mentous actin commensurate with a 1 : 1 binding of actin monomers to Scar - WA ( data not shown ) . While we did not see actin depolymerization in our assay , we cannot rule out a depolymerizing activity for Scar proteins until we have further characterized them . We also used various drugs to try to disrupt the interaction of Scar - WA with actin in cytosol , in order to probe further the relationship between the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin binding . We found no effect from adding DNase I or latrunculin B , both of which can bind monomeric actin , but a relatively high concentration of cytochalasin D ( 50 mM ) , which prevents actin polymer - ization but can also bind to actin monomers at high con - centrations , removed 90 % of the bound actin without affecting the bound Arp2 / 3 complex ( data not shown ) . We conclude that Scar - WA binds to monomeric but not to fila - mentous actin , and that this interaction is not dependent on the association with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Scar1 and WASP carboxyl termini bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo Because p21 - Arc is an integral part of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we assayed its interaction with Scar1 or WASP in vivo . We transfected Cos - 7 cells with DNA encoding Scar and WASP fragments tagged with a c - Myc epitope , and immunoprecipitated the constructs from cell lysates using an anti - Myc antibody ( Figure 4 ) . We found that the endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex interacts with Scar - WA or WASP - WA , but not with Scar - S ( Figure 4 ) . All constructs were expressed to similar levels and all were immunopre - cipitated as assayed with the anti - Myc antibody ( data not shown ) . All of the components of the Arp2 / 3 complex for which we have probes ( Arp3 , Arp2 and p34 - Arc ) co - precip - itated in these assays . Thus , the carboxyl termini of Scar1 and WASP bind to endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo , presumably through a direct interaction with p21 - Arc . We attempted , but were unable , to immunoprecipitate full - length WASP or Scar proteins . This may be due to folding or insolubility of the full - length constructs . Overexpression of Scar and WASP disrupts the actin cytoskeleton Given that Scar1 and WASP bound to the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro , it seemed possible that their roles in vivo involve targeting the complex to regions of the cell where dynamic actin remodelling is required . We tested this hypothesis by microinjecting a mammalian expression vector containing Myc - tagged fragments of Scar1 and WASP into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and J774 macrophages . In serum - deprived Swiss 3T3 cells , which lack lamellipodia and stress fibers , the Arp2 / 3 complex was localized primarily to actin - con - taining spots ( uninjected cells ; Figure 5a , b ) , whereas it was localized primarily to lamellipodia and punctate structures in growing cells ( uninjected cells ; Figure 5c , d ) . When 1350 Current Biology , Vol 8 No 25 Figure 3 Scar - WA interacts with actin monomers but not actin filaments .

In growing cells , however , we observed a complete loss of lamellipodia , in addition to a disruption of the localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5c , d ) . Interestingly , we did not see any reduction in phalloidin staining and , in addition to promi - nent stress fibers , the cells showed an increased perinu - clear diffuse phalloidin staining . Similarly , overexpression of WASP - WA also disrupted the localiza - tion of the Arp2 / 3 complex in serum - deprived cells with minimal effect on the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 5e , f ) . In growing cells it also abolished lamellipodia and displaced Arp2 / 3 complex from the periphery of the cell ( Figure 5g , h ) . Cells overexpressing Scar - W , which binds to monomeric actin but not to the Arp2 / 3 complex , did not show any disruption of lamellipodia ( Figure 5i ) nor dis - ruption of the Arp2 / 3 complex localization ( Figure 5j ) . Overexpression of Scar - SP did not have any effect on fil - amentous actin staining , lamellipodia or Arp2 / 3 complex localization , whereas full - length Scar1 or Scar - PWA caused a similar phenotype to the Scar - WA fragment ( data not shown ) . All constructs showed a similar expres - sion level and an even cytoplasmic distribution , as shown by immunostaining for the Myc epitope ( Figure 6 , and data not shown ) . Overexpression of full - length WASP in fibroblasts caused accumulation of perinuclear filamen - tous actin structures similar to those previously reported [ 19 ] , and concomitant disruption of Arp2 / 3 complex local - ization . The perinuclear filamentous actin structures also contained the Arp2 / 3 complex , as visualized with an anti - p34 - Arc antibody , and WASP , as visualized with an anti - Myc epitope antibody . The effect of Scar - WA expression was not cell - type spe - cific , as we also observed a complete loss of lamellipodia from J774 macrophages which had been injected with Scar - WA ( Figure 5k , l ) . Macrophages expressing Scar - WA did not round up , but lost surface protrusions ( ruffles and filopodia ) and showed a uniform filamentous actin Research Paper Scar1 and WASP in cytoskeletal regulation Machesky and Insall 1351 Figure 5 Localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex is disrupted upon overexpression of Scar - WA or WASP - WA constructs in cells .

The Arp2 / 3 complex staining pattern remained punctate , but was no longer associated with peripheral structures . We found that the fragments of Scar and WASP that bind the Arp2 / 3 complex dramatically altered both actin local - ization and Arp2 / 3 complex localization in cells . The lack of inhibition of lamellipodia by the Scar - W construct sug - gests that the binding of actin by WASP or Scar1 does not mediate their effects on the actin cytoskeleton . Instead , it appears that a direct interaction between Scar1 / WASP - related proteins and the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for the assembly and maintenance of lamellipodia and actin spots under normal growth conditions . Overexpression of Scar - WA prevents the growth - factor - induced assembly of actin structures As the Arp2 / 3 complex has multiple activities in vitro , we investigated its role in the growth - factor - induced assem - bly of specific actin - cytoskeletal structures . We found that , in cells growing in serum , lamellipodia were com - pletely suppressed within 10 minutes by injecting Scar - WA protein ( data not shown ) , or within 2 hours for the Scar - WA DNA expression construct . But if cells injected with DNA expression constructs were left for longer times ( 4 – 6 hours ) , stress fibers also disassembled , leaving the cell full of diffuse filamentous actin ( Figure 6a , b ) . As activation of the small GTPase Rac through the PDGF receptor induces lamellipodia in qui - escent serum - starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts [ 30 ] , we tested whether Scar - fragment expression could inhibit this response . Overexpression of the actin - binding fragment Scar - W had no effect on PDGF - induced ruffling ( Figure 6c , d ) . In contrast , Scar - WA overexpression com - pletely suppressed lamellipodia assembly in response to PDGF addition ( Figure 6e , f ) . Of 66 injected cells , none ruffled in response to PDGF under conditions where more than 95 % of uninjected cells or Scar - W - expressing cells were ruffling . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex appears to be important for lamellipodia assembly both in serum and in response to PDGF . Given that activation of the small GTPase Rho through the sphingosine 1 - phosphate ( S - 1 - P ) or lysophosphatidic acid receptors results in the assembly of actin stress fibers [ 31 , 32 ] , we tested the effect of Scar - fragment overexpres - sion on this response . Overexpression of the actin - binding fragment of Scar1 , Scar - W , had no effect on the assembly of stress fibers in response to S - 1 - P ( Figure 6g , h ) . In contrast , Scar - WA - overexpressing cells could only partially assemble actin bundles resembling stress fibers ( Figure 6i , j ) . Of 84 injected cells , none showed parallel stress fibers , but all showed some weak bundling of actin filaments under conditions where 100 % of Scar - W - expressing or uninjected cells formed stress fibers . Our data suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex is important for the assembly of actin stress fibers in response to S - 1 - P . As WASP interacts with Cdc42 [ 18 , 19 ] , it would be desir - able to ask whether the formation of filopodia is also inhibited by overexpression of fragments of WASP or Scar1 . Although it has been reported that bradykinin 1352 Current Biology , Vol 8 No 25 Figure 6 Scar - WA overexpression inhibits lamellipodia formation and stress fiber assembly .

Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant Cdc42 [ 34 ] in serum - starved quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells induced filopodia which were not inhib - ited by co - expression of Scar - WA ( data not shown ) . However , in J774 macrophages , endogenous filopodia were inhibited by overexpression of Scar - WA ( Figure 5k , l ) . We conclude that disruption of the endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex – Scar1 / WASP interaction by overexpres - sion of Scar fragments has multiple effects on the actin cytoskeleton , the strongest of which is the suppression of lamellipodia . This indicates multiple roles for the Arp2 / 3 complex in cells , a suggestion which is supported by in vitro data [ 4 ] . Discussion Much excitement has been generated by recent findings that the Arp2 / 3 complex can nucleate , cap and crosslink actin filaments [ 4 , 5 ] . Studies in Listeria monocytogenes showed that the purified Arp2 / 3 complex can initiate actin polymerization in conjunction with the bacterial protein ActA [ 5 , 7 ] . ActA amino - terminal fragments greatly enhance the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro [ 5 ] . This finding suggests that a cellular factor might serve a similar purpose to regulate the assembly of dynamic actin structures such as lamellipo - dia . It is possible that WASP and Scar proteins could have this function in cells . Alternatively , WASP and Scar pro - teins may serve to concentrate or localize the Arp2 / 3 complex to sites of dynamic actin assembly . Although we cannot distinguish between these possibilities until we can determine the effects of WASP / Scar proteins on the various activities of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro , we favor a model in which WASP and Scar proteins serve to initi - ate actin nucleation in response to signals . This could be achieved by bringing actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex into close proximity , perhaps in the correct ori - entation for filament - nucleus formation ( Figure 7 ) . This could explain the function of the actin - binding site on WASP and Scar proteins . The disruption of the interaction of actin with Scar - WA by cytochalasin D also suggests that the interaction of Scar1 with actin may be conformationally sensitive . Cytocha - lasin D induces a change in the conformation of actin monomers that is thought to resemble the filamentous state and it also induces the formation of actin dimers [ 35 , 36 ] . Perhaps a conformational change or a dimerization causes actin monomers to dissociate from Scar or WASP and thus opens up the binding site for a new monomer to promote further polymerization in conjunction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . We postulate that Scar or WASP proteins could thus shuttle actin monomers to the Arp2 / 3 complex for addition into filaments ( Figure 7 ) . WASP interacts with the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 as well as with the adaptor protein Nck [ 18 , 19 , 21 ] . As overexpression of the carboxy - terminal Arp2 / 3 - complex - binding fragment of Scar1 inhibits PDGF - stimulated for - mation of lamellipodia , we think it likely that there is a direct connection between WASP / Scar proteins , the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin assembly downstream of small GTPases and receptors . Our study may have a direct bearing on the interpreta - tion of phenotypes in Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome . Muta - tions occurring in patients with the most severe forms of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( as characterized by throm - bocytopenia and defects of chemotaxis and cytoarchitec - ture in T and B cells ) often occur as mis - sense or premature - termination signals in the last 59 amino acids of WASP [ 24 ] . This region lies further towards the car - boxyl terminus than the WH2 domain , so we expect that mutations here may impair binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Most Wiskott – Aldrich patients do not express any WASP , but we are currently searching for any who might express a protein with a mutation in the carboxyl terminus . Research Paper Scar1 and WASP in cytoskeletal regulation Machesky and Insall 1353 Figure 7 A model for how signals from receptors could connect to the Arp2 / 3 complex to stimulate actin assembly and reorganization in cells . Signals from cytokine and growth - factor receptors communicate with the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 , which in turn could trigger WASP or N - WASP to activate or localize the Arp2 / 3 complex , resulting in actin assembly in lamellipodia or microspikes . Both Scar and WASP proteins could connect to receptor tyrosine kinases through an interaction with the polyproline - containing domains . Additionally , Scar1 could be connected to seven - transmembrane serpentine receptors through heterotrimeric G proteins and thus could mediate actin polymerization in response to chemoattractants . Arp2 / 3 complex bound to the carboxyl terminus of WASP or Scar might interact with monomeric actin bound to the WH2 domain and nucleate a new actin filament and / or become localized through the other interactions of WASP and Scar proteins . Y P Nck Receptor tyrosine kinase Serpentine receptor Rac / Cdc42 SH2 SH3 CRIB PH Current Biology WASP Scar Arp2 / 3 complex A r p 2 A r p 3 WH2 Acidic(cid:13)domain PPPPP PPPPP ? Actin Heterotrimeric(cid:13)G protein Although Scar1 is much less well - characterized than WASP , data from Dictyostelium suggest that Scar1 lies in a signalling pathway connected to the cyclic AMP receptor cAR2 [ 27 ] , which is a classical serpentine receptor coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein . Scar1 mutants also show a greatly diminished level of filamentous actin . This sug - gests a model ( Figure 7 ) in which signals generated through different receptors and mediators — such as growth factors , small GTPases and G proteins — converge on the Arp2 / 3 complex to trigger or localize actin assembly . It may seem unexpected that overexpression of Scar - WA inhibits the assembly of both stress fibers and lamellipo - dia . We think that the inhibition of stress fiber assembly could suggest a requirement for new actin polymerization in stress fiber formation or , alternatively , a requirement for crosslinking or pointed - end capping by the Arp2 / 3 complex . The Arp2 / 3 complex does not localize strongly to stress fibers or filopodia , both of which are composed of actin in parallel bundles with actin - binding proteins . The complex does , however , appear near the base of filopodia in macrophages and along the distal tips of some stress fibers ( L . M . M . , unpublished observations ) . Thus , we propose that there may be an organizational or initiating role for the Arp2 / 3 complex in some bundled actin struc - tures . Equally , the Arp2 / 3 complex may be required to maintain the general integrity of the actin cortex , in a way similar to its role in yeast . Cortical integrity is probably important generally for the assembly of actin - based struc - tures , and cortical actin depletion may explain the fenes - trated appearance of some of the cells overexpressing Scar or WASP - WA ( for example , Figure 6e ) . Other proteins contain domains similar to Scar and WASP - WA . We predict that N - WASP , which contains similar WH2 and acidic domains , will also interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex . It will be interesting to see whether verprolin [ 37 ] , Las17p / Bee1p [ 26 ] , and WIP [ 38 ] , which also contain WH2 domains , will bind to p21 - Arc . One of the next challenges will be to understand how the various WASP - related proteins transmit signals to the Arp2 / 3 complex and how cells can use the Arp2 / 3 complex to help generate actin structures as diverse as lamellipodia , filopodia and actin bundles , structures that we observe in motile cells . Materials and methods Transfections and immunoprecipitations Cos cells were transfected using Lipofectamine ( GIBCO - BRL ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Plasmids , based on the pRK5 vector , were transfected into 10 cm dishes of Cos - 7 cells for 24 h before lysis in 0 . 5 ml lysis buffer ( 10 % glycerol , 50 mM Tris – Cl pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 ) on ice for 10 min . Lysed cells were scraped from the dish and centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 · g at 4°C . Supernatants were incubated with protein - A - coupled Sepharose beads covalently linked to 9E10 anti - Myc epitope anti - body ( a kind gift from D . Drechsel ) for 30 min on ice . The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed three times in lysis buffer . Sample buffer was added to the supernatants and pellets , and both were separated on 12 % polyacrylamide gels . The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the following antibodies : 9E10 ( to recognize the epitope - tagged Scar1 constructs ) , anti - p34 - Arc and anti - Arp3 ( to recognize endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex ) . At least four independent transfections were done for each experiment , with similar results . To estimate the amount of co - precipitated Arp2 / 3 complex , we scanned autoradiograms of our western blots and used the program NIH Image to quantitate the density in the region of either Arp3 or p34 - Arc on the blot . The average of four measurements was reported in each case . For all lysis conditions that we tried , including standard RIPA buffer ( containing 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 50 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 ) , approximately half of the total Arp2 / 3 complex remained insoluble and therefore inaccessible to the experiment . Microinjection and immunofluorescence Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % FCS and prepared for serum starvation as previously described [ 31 , 32 ] . A 0 . 1 mg / ml preparation of DNA in CsCl was microinjected into the nucleus as previously described [ 34 ] . For immunofluorescence , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and processed as previ - ously described [ 34 ] . J774 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % FCS , serum - deprived for 1 h prior to microinjection to increase cell adhesion which facilitates microinjection ( E . Caron , personal com - munication ) , and were viewed using a BioRad MRC1000 confocal microscope . We and others have shown previously that the mammalian Arp2 / 3 complex subunits Arp3 , Arp2 , p34 - Arc and p21 - Arc have the same localization in cells and by biochemical fractionation [ 1 , 2 ] . For our microinjection experiments , we observed the described effect in > 90 % of at least 50 microinjected cells . For Scar - WA and Scar - W , we injected cells blind , so that the person doing the injections and looking at the cells did not know which DNA construct was being used . Under these conditions , 69 / 72 cells in serum were ruf - fling after injection of Scar - W , whereas 0 / 50 cells were ruffling after injection of Scar - WA . In starved cells , 62 / 66 cells injected with Scar - WA showed delocalization of the Arp2 / 3 complex and 5 / 74 cells showed a similar delocalized Arp2 / 3 complex after Scar - W injec - tions . All injected cells were fixed and stained at approximately 2 h post - injection , unless otherwise indicated . This is the minimum time at which most cells express injected pRK5 constructs in our hands . Injection of Scar - WA protein was done using approximately 1 mg / ml thrombin - cleaved protein in PBS . As we do not yet have antibodies to Scar1 , we cannot compare the levels of overexpression to levels of endogenous proteins . However , we estimate that expression levels are in the range of 200 nM to 1 m M based on the immunofluores - cence staining intensity as compared to injected Myc - tagged pro - teins of known concentration . GST fusion protein binding assays Porcine brain cytosol was produced by homogenization of one porcine brain ( 80 g tissue ) in 80 ml homogenization buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 mM benzamidine , 1 mM PMSF and 0 . 1 mg / ml each chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain and pepstatin ) . The homogenate was centrifuged at 50 , 000 · g for 30 min and the supernatant was stored in 1 ml aliquots in liquid nitrogen . An aliquot was thawed before each experiment and centrifuged for 20 min at 100 , 000 · g to clarify . The supernatant contained approximately 16 mg / ml protein and was used on the day of thawing . Approximately 10 m g of each GST - fusion protein bound to 10 m l of agarose beads was mixed with 50 m l extract and 150 m l bead buffer ( PBS + 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 ) . Tubes were incubated for 30 min at 4°C on a rotating wheel , then beads were pelleted at 5 , 000 · g for 15 sec in a microfuge and washed twice in bead buffer . Supernatants and beads were boiled in sample buffer and separated on 12 % polyacrylamide gels . Gels were stained with Coomassie blue and scanned using an Agfa scanner or blotted onto nitrocellulose and assayed by immunoblotting using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit ( Amersham ) . All experiments 1354 Current Biology , Vol 8 No 25 were repeated at least twice with similar results . We used the program NIH Image to obtain semi - quantitative estimates of the binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to Scar and WASP fragments . We assumed that actin represented 1 % of the total protein in our extracts and that Arp2 / 3 complex was present at a 30 - fold lower concentration [ 3 ] . Actin - binding assays Actin was purified from rabbit muscle as previously described [ 39 ] and stored in liquid nitrogen in aliquots in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM CaCl 2 ) . All actin - binding assays were performed in G - buffer or G - buffer + 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 for GST fusion - protein binding experiments . Scar - WA was cleaved from the glutathione – agarose by overnight incubation with 10 units bovine thrombin ( Sigma ) . We used western blotting instead of Coomassie blue staining to detect the bound actin because it co - migrated with Scar - WA . Actin was polymerized for filamentous - actin binding experi - ments by adding 0 . 1 volume of KME salts ( 500 mM KCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA ) and was separated from unpolymerized actin by centrifugation at 100 , 000 · g for 20 min in a Beckman tabletop ultra - centrifuge . Pellets were washed twice in KME + G - buffer , dissolved in sample buffer , and separated on 12 % polyacrylamide gels , which were then stained with Coomassie blue .
