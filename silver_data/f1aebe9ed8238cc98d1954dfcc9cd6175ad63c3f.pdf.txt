Although the migratory behavior of di ﬀ erent cell types on structured substrates has already been investigated , up to date it is largely unknown if specimen ' s age a ﬀ ects cell migration on structures . In this work , we investigated age - dependent migratory behavior of human endothelial cells from young ( ≤ 31 years old ) and old ( ≥ 60 years old ) donors on poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) microstructured substrates consisting of well - de ﬁ ned parallel grooves . We observed a decrease in cell migration velocity in all substrate conditions and in persistence length perpendicular to the grooves in cells from old donors . Nevertheless , in comparison to young cells , old cells exhibited a higher cell directionality along grooves of certain depths and a higher persistence time . We also found a systematic decrease of donor age - dependent responses of cell protru - sions in orientation , velocity and length , all of them decreased in old cells . These observations lead us to hy - pothesize a possible impairment of actin cytoskeleton network and a ﬀ ected actin polymerization and steering systems , caused by aging . 1 . Introduction Cell migration is a complex cell phenomenon involved in many important biological processes such as organogenesis [ 1 ] , wound healing [ 2 ] or cancer metastasis [ 3 ] . In vivo , cells encounter a milieu of chemical and physical signals that in ﬂ uence their migratory behavior for instance by tuning their speed or their direction [ 4 – 7 ] . These signals can be soluble chemicals in the environment ( chemotaxis ) [ 8 ] , an electrical ﬁ eld ( galvanotaxis ) [ 9 , 10 ] or the properties of the substrate / matrix such as surface chemistry ( haptotaxis ) [ 11 , 12 ] , sti ﬀ ness ( dur - otaxis ) [ 13 , 14 ] or topography ( contact guidance ) [ 15 – 17 ] . For the latter , it has been shown in vitro that 2D surface topographies at the micro - and nanoscale can in ﬂ uence migratory behavior of di ﬀ erent cell types [ 18 – 23 ] and cells of di ﬀ erent physiological conditions , such as diseased cells [ 24 – 26 ] . However , an important biological state that has been poorly investigated in this respect is donor age . The positive social repercussion that the improvement of elder welfare can have , creates also a great interest to investigate aging from a biophysical point of view [ 27 – 31 ] . For example , investigation in migratory behavior of cells from old donors on micro - / nano - structured substrates may help eluci - dating important cell mechanisms that are a ﬀ ected by age . Such e ﬀ ects may alter cell response to implant surfaces or to signals in wound healing . It has been observed that human skin ﬁ broblasts from old donors ( > 30 years ) orient worse along microgrooves than cells from young donors ( < 30 years ) [ 29 ] , but studies focusing on the contact guidance behavior of cells from donors of di ﬀ erent age are missing . One cell type of particular interest to study the in ﬂ uence of age factor on cell migratory behavior on surface topography , are human endothelial cells ( ECs ) . These cells are lining the blood vessels , forming the so - called endothelium , and therefore in contact with the blood - stream . Furthermore , ECs are involved in cardiovascular diseases where the use of stents is needed [ 32 – 34 ] . The development of new stents with modi ﬁ ed chemical and physical properties ( e . g . surface topography ) will improve their integration into the organism by controlling cell behavior [ 35 , 36 ] . Thus , donor age becomes an important aspect to consider in the development of these new implants . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . yexcr . 2018 . 10 . 008 Received 11 June 2018 ; Received in revised form 12 October 2018 ; Accepted 15 October 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author .

T Therefore , we investigated how donor age a ﬀ ects di ﬀ erent contact guidance migration parameters of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) . We studied cell directionality , velocity and persistence of ECs from young and old donors on poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) ( PDMS ) microstructured substrates , having parallel microgrooves with widths in the microscale and depths in the submicron - scale , since these cells respond to these topographical features [ 15 , 22 ] . In order to further characterize cell adhesion , we characterized cell morphology as well as the orientation , velocity and length of the protrusions . In the present study , we con ﬁ rmed the importance of considering donor age as an important factor in research studies of cell - material interactions since we observed age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell mi - gratory behavior , cell morphology , and protrusion dynamics . This work shows for the ﬁ rst time age - dependent cell migratory behavior on structured substrates and sheds light into the poorly studied ﬁ eld of donor - age dependent cell responses to biomaterials . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Substrate fabrication and functionalization Surface topographies were created on silicon wafers ( Siegert Wafer GmbH , Germany ) . By means of photolithography the lateral size of microgrooves was controlled , while physical vapor deposition ( PVD ) enabled the precise control of the height . Wafers were baked 30 min at 200 °C to remove adsorbed water before they were coated with hex - amethyldisilazane ( HDMS , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) to improve photoresist adhesion . Positive photoresist ma - P1210 ( Micro resist technology GmbH , Germany ) was coated on the wafer at a thickness of 1 . 0 – 1 . 2 µm , and baked for 1 min at 100 °C . Coated wafers were then aligned ( MJB4 , Süss MicroTech GmbH , Germany ) to a chromium photomask ( ML & C GmbH , Germany ) and exposed to UV light ( λ = 405 nm ) from a mer - cury lamp source ( HBO 350 W , Osram , Germany ) , solubilizing the ex - posed regions . Solubilized photoresist was washed with a developer solution ( ma - D 531 , Micro resist technology GmbH , Germany ) and subsequently coated with a layer of chromium of the desired thickness by means of physical vapor deposition ( PVD ) . Remaining photoresist was eliminated by sonicating the wafers for 5 min in a remover solution ( mr - Rem 660 , Micro resist technology GmbH , Germany ) . Microgrooved silicon wafers were used as templates to produce replicates with Sylgard 184 poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) ( PDMS ) ( Dow Corning , USA ) . Microgrooved substrates of four di ﬀ erent depths ( D ) ( 100 , 200 , 350 and 650 nm ) and two di ﬀ erent widths ( W ) ( 2 and 10 µm ) were used in this work . Flat substrates were used as controls . PDMS was mixed at 10 : 1 ratio ( elastomer to curing agent ) and in - cubated at 65 °C for 24 h . Characterization of the substrates was carried out with scanning electron microscopy ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) and atomic force microscopy ( JPK Instruments , Germany ) . Previously to cell seeding , PDMS substrates were sterilized with 70 % ethanol , then coated with 40 µg / mL poly ( L - lysine ) ( PLL , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) to enhance the subsequent coating with 10 µg / mL human ﬁ bronectin ( hFN ) , both PLL and hFN diluted in PBS . Fibronectin was isolated from blood serum provided by Katharinenhospital in Stuttgart , Germany . 2 . 2 . Cell culture and age groups Human coronary artery endothelial cells ( abbreviated hereafter ECs ) ( Promocell , Germany ) were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium supplemented with Supplement Mix ( Promocell , Germany ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies , Germany ) . In order to avoid cell dedi ﬀ erentiation , cells were used below passage 7 . Cells were maintained in an incubator ( Binder GmbH , Germany ) at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 , and high humidity ( > 90 % ) . Subculturing was performed with Trypsin / EDTA ( 0 . 04 % / 0 . 03 % ) ( Promocell , Germany ) before reaching 100 % con ﬂ uence . For the purpose of this study , ECs from donors with di ﬀ erent ages were used . We grouped donors ages in the young age group ( ≤ 31 years old ) , in this work referred as young ECs , and the old age group ( ≥ 60 years old ) , referred as old ECs . For the migration and protrusion analyses , 3 biological replicates were carried out , that is 3 independent experiments using 3 di ﬀ erent donors from each age group . For the cell orientation analysis , between 2 and 3 biological replicates were carried out . 2 . 3 . Optical microscopy All experiments were done on an inverted microscope ( Observer Z1 with Zeiss AxioCam , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) in a GP - 168 incubating system ( EMBL , Heidelberg , Germany ) to maintain the temperature at 37 °C and the CO 2 at 5 % during the course of cell trajectories or pro - trusion dynamics record . Humidity was maintained at 50 % . In order to record cell trajectories in migration experiments , phase contrast pic - tures were acquired every 5 or 10 min with a 5x objective ( N - Achroplan , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) for 24 h . For cell protrusions analyses , phase contrast pictures were acquired every 1 or 2 min for 4 – 6 h , using 10× ( EC Plan - Neo ﬂ uar , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) or 20× ( EC Plan - Neo ﬂ uar , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) objectives . For cell orientation analysis , phase contrast pictures were acquired with a 10x objective ( EC Plan - Neo ﬂ uar , Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . For cell orientation analysis , 48 h after cell seeding cell media was absorbed and cells were incubated in a solution of 4 % paraformalde - hyde ( PFA ) ( Serva Electrophoresis GmbH , Germany ) in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C , followed by 3 rinses with PBS . 2 . 4 . Image and data analysis For migration experiments , where directionality , velocity and per - sistence were analyzed , a total of 90 cells on 4 groove depths ( 100 , 200 , 350 and 650 nm ) and 2 widths ( 2 and 10 µm ) , as well as ﬂ at surface , from 3 biological replicates with di ﬀ erent donors per age group were manually tracked ( 30 cells per experimental condition ) with an ImageJ plugin , MTrackJ [ 37 ] . Trajectory plots were plotted with the Microsoft Excel macro “ DiPer ” [ 38 ] . For protrusions experiments , orientation , velocity and length of cell protrusions were analyzed with a custom - made macro in ImageJ , for a total of 600 manually - tracked protrusions on one structure condition ( 650 nm deep , 2 µm wide microgrooves ) , as well as on ﬂ at surface , from 3 biological replicates with di ﬀ erent donors per age group ( 10 cells per experimental condition and 20 protrusions per cell ) . This custom - made macro calculated automatically the aforementioned protrusion para - meters once the beginning and end of the protrusion was marked by the user . Protrusions ends were delimitated when these stopped extending in a certain direction ( Fig . S1A , B ) . For cell morphology experiments , between 100 and 150 cells from 2 or 3 biological replicates with dif - ferent donors per age group were analyzed for each condition . 2 . 5 . Data analysis Migration directionality , cell and protrusion orientation were cal - culated with the following formula [ 39 ] : = OP cos α ( 2 ) direct prot cell / . / . ( 1 ) where OP stands for orientation parameter and “ α cell ” is , in terms of cell orientation , the angle in radians between the major axis of the ﬁ tted ellipse for a single cell , and the grooves or the desired reference ( Fig . S2B ) . In terms of cell migration directionality ( “ α direct . ” ) and protrusion orientation , ( “ α prot . ” ) the term α " " is the angle in radians between the ﬁ rst and last point of the migration track or the protrusion , and the microgrooves or the desired reference ( Fig . S2A , C ) . When OP = 1 mi - gration or orientation is parallel to the reference ( e . g . grooves direc - tion ) , when OP = 0 migration or orientation is random and when OP = - A . Sales et al . Experimental Cell Research 374 ( 2019 ) 1 – 11 2 1 migration or orientation is perpendicular to the reference . Migration velocity was calculated by dividing the total trajectory length ( in µm ) by the total time ( in min ) . Migration persistence length was calculated by dividing the total length displaced on each axis ( X and Y ) by the number of times that cells changed the direction of migration in each axis . A change in di - rection of migration is considered when the angle of displacement be - tween the cell and the axis ( X , parallel to grooves , or Y , perpendicular to grooves ) is > 90° ( Fig . S1C ) [ 40 ] . Migration persistence time was obtained by dividing the total time ( 24 h ) by the number of changes in the direction of migration in each axis ( X - axis , parallel to microgrooves , and Y - axis , perpendicular to microgrooves ) . The cell elongation was calculated using the following formula : = − + Elongation A A A A maj min maj min ( 2 ) where A maj and A min are the lengths of the major and minor axes , re - spectively , of a ﬁ tted ellipse on a marked cell . An elongation value of 0 corresponds to a perfect circle and a value of 1 corresponds to a perfect line . 2 . 6 . Statistical analysis In all graphics , horizontal lines represent the median values , the 25 % and 75 % is illustrated as the box , and the error bars correspond to one standard deviation . Signi ﬁ cance tests were calculated with Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA . Signi ﬁ cance was considered if p < 0 . 05 ( * ) and p < 0 . 01 ( * * ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . EC migration velocity , directionality , and persistence length on microgrooved substrates are age - dependent Migratory behavior of ECs from young and old donors was studied and quanti ﬁ ed on substrates of four di ﬀ erent depths ( D = 100 , 200 , 350 and 650 nm ) and two di ﬀ erent widths ( W = 2 and 10 µm ) ( Fig . 1A ) , as well as on ﬂ at control surfaces . Fig . 1D - F shows cell tra - jectory plots of young ECs on ﬂ at and microgrooved substrates . On ﬂ at surfaces , ECs migrated with no preferred direction since no guiding signal was present ( Fig . 1 B ) . Instead , on microgrooved substrates cell trajectories were directed more along microgrooves direction the deeper and narrower these were ( Fig . 1C - F ) . After quantifying cell di - rectionality along microgrooves direction , guided migration along mi - crogrooves was observed with ECs from both age groups ( Fig . 1G and H ) . Age - dependent di ﬀ erences could be observed in cell directionality , especially on W = 2 µm microgrooves . On these substrates , old cells migrated signi ﬁ cantly more directional along microgrooves than young cells on substrates with deep microgrooves ( ≥ 200 nm ) ( Fig . 1G ) . On W = 10 µm microgrooves , old cell directionality was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of young cells only on D = 350 nm microgrooves ( Fig . 1H ) . Interestingly , when cell migration velocity was analyzed , we ob - served that ECs from old age group migrated signi ﬁ cantly slower than those from young age group in all substrate conditions ( Fig . 1I and J ) . However , no di ﬀ erences between microgrooved and ﬂ at substrates were generally observed in none of groove widths and age groups , with exception of young ECs on D = 200 nm deep / W = 2 µm wide micro - grooves , where velocity was found to be signi ﬁ cantly lower than that of young ECs on ﬂ at surfaces . These results suggest that the cell machinery enabling migration may be a ﬀ ected by donor age . Additionally , we also statistically compared inter - donor variation in some substrate condi - tions ( ﬂ at , D = 200 and 650 nm / W = 2 and 10 µm microgrooves ) for migration velocity ( Fig . S3 ) . Cell migration persistence length on X - axis and Y - axis was also studied ( Fig . 2 ) . On both microgroove widths and in both age groups , the ECs persistence length increased along microgroove direction ( Fig . 2A and B ) and decreased perpendicular to them ( Fig . 2D and E ) , the deeper the microgrooves were . The persistence length of young ECs along X - axis was of the order of ~ 50 µm on ﬂ at surface and of ~ 75 µm on D = 650 nm / W = 2 µm microgrooves , instead , ~ 40 µm on ﬂ at surfaces and ~ 20 µm on microgrooved surfaces for Y - axis . No age - dependent di ﬀ erences were observed in persistence length along X - axis in none of microgroove widths , with exception of ECs on D = 350 nm / W = 10 µm microgrooves where the value distribution of young ECs is signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of old ECs ( Fig . 2C ) . However , young ECs migrated signi ﬁ cantly more persistent along Y - axis than old cells , on narrow ( 2 µm ) and deep ( ≥ 350 nm ) microgrooves as well as on D = 200 and 350 nm / W = 10 µm microgrooves ( Fig . 2D and E ) . These results indicate a higher con ﬁ nement along grooves direction of old cells than young cells displacement , generally on deep grooves ( Fig . 2F ) . We also noticed that , similarly to the persistence length , the per - sistence time increased along microgrooves direction ( X - axis ) on deeper microgrooves ( Figs . S4A and B ) , while it decreased perpendicular to microgrooves direction ( Y - axis ) ( Figs . S4D and E ) . Generally old cells migrated signi ﬁ cantly longer time than young ones along microgroove direction , in most of the substrate conditions ( Fig . S4A - C ) . Moreover , this age - dependent di ﬀ erence was even greater when cells migrated perpendicular to microgrooves , being it signi ﬁ cantly di ﬀ erent in all substrate conditions except in D = 200 nm / W = 10 µm ( Fig . S4D - F ) . These results suggest a longer - lasting migration of old cells than young ones along each axis . 3 . 2 . In ﬂ uence of microgrooves on young and old EC morphology In order to study whether there is a correlation between cell shape and cell migratory behavior , we analyzed the following parameters : cell area , elongation and orientation of young and old ECs on the 4 mi - crogrooves depths ( D from 100 to 650 nm ) and the 2 depths ( W = 2 and 10 µm ) in comparison to ﬂ at surfaces ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . Cell area values were comprised between ~ 3000 and ~ 4500 µm 2 , reaching the maximum on D = 350 nm microgrooves ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Area of old cells was signi ﬁ cantly greater than that of young cells , only on ﬂ at substrates and W = 10 µm / D = 350 and 650 nm microgrooves , while on W = 2 µm / D = 200 nm microgrooves area of young cells was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of old cells . In all these cases , the dif - ference in cell area was around 15 % . Regarding the di ﬀ erences between cell area on microgrooves and ﬂ at substrates , on W = 2 µm micro - grooves young cells were signi ﬁ cantly bigger on D = 200 and 350 nm microgrooves than on ﬂ at surfaces . Instead , old cells were signi ﬁ cantly bigger only on D = 350 nm but signi ﬁ cantly smaller on D = 200 and 650 nm microgrooves in comparison with ﬂ at surfaces ( Fig . 4A ) . On W = 10 µm microgrooves , young cells were signi ﬁ cantly bigger than those on ﬂ at surfaces on all microgroove depths except on D = 650 nm . However , old cells were only signi ﬁ cantly bigger on D = 350 nm mi - crogrooves than those on ﬂ at surfaces ( Fig . 4B ) . Altogether , there is a tendency for young cells to increase their area on microgrooved sub - strates . Nevertheless , age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell area are minor and no clear tendency can be observed . After analyzing the cell elongation , we observed that young cells were signi ﬁ cantly more elongated than old ones on W = 2 µm / D = 100 , 350 and 650 nm , and on W = 10 µm / D = 100 , 200 , and 350 nm microgrooves but not on ﬂ at surfaces ( Fig . 4C and D ) . These di ﬀ erences were around ∼ 10 – 38 % . When comparing the cell elonga - tion on microgrooves with elongation on ﬂ at surfaces , we observed that young cells elongated signi ﬁ cantly more on W = 2 µm microgrooves , for all depths , than on ﬂ at surfaces . Instead , old cells elongated sig - ni ﬁ cantly more on W = 2 µm / D = 200 and 650 nm microgrooves than on ﬂ at surfaces ( Fig . 4C ) . On W = 10 µm , young cells elongated A . Sales et al .

A total of 90 cells per age group and substrate condition from 3 independent experiments using 3 di ﬀ erent donors , were evaluated . The median is illustrated as a horizontal line in the middle of the box , the interquartile range is illustrated as the box , and the error bars correspond to one standard deviation . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was determined by the non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA test ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 ) . A . Sales et al . Experimental Cell Research 374 ( 2019 ) 1 – 11 4 signi ﬁ cantly more on D = 200 , 350 and 650 nm microgrooves than on ﬂ at surfaces . However , on that microgroove width , old cells elongated signi ﬁ cantly more only on D = 650 nm and signi ﬁ cantly less on D = 100 nm microgrooves than on ﬂ at surfaces ( Fig . 4D ) . These results show age - dependent cell elongation on microgrooved substrates , and an increase of young cells elongation on microgrooves . Cell orientation is a widely used parameter to measure cell contact guidance on a microstructure surface [ 15 , 22 , 41 ] . Thus , we studied whether the age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell directionality and velo - city also a ﬀ ected cell orientation along microgrooves . Cell orientation values are normally higher than those of migration directionality . For example , while the highest cell orientation values are close to 1 ( Fig . 4E and F ) , the highest directionality values are close to 0 . 55 ( Fig . 1G and H ) . Age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell orientation were observed only on D = 350 nm microgrooves and both widths , where young cells oriented signi ﬁ cantly more along microgrooves than old cells . These results in - dicate di ﬀ erences between cell orientation and migration directionality as two ways of measuring contact guidance . 3 . 3 . ECs protrusion orientation , velocity and length are age - and substrate topography - dependent In order to further characterize the cell behavior , ECs protrusions were studied for both age groups . We selected the condition D = 650 nm / W = 2 µm since cell migration was the highest on these microgrooves . Flat surfaces were taken as control . Protrusions are ex - tensions of the cell membrane mainly mediated by the actin poly - merization machinery enabling directed cell membrane extension , which is important for cell migration [ 42 , 43 ] as well as for detection and reaction to substrate microtopography [ 44 , 45 ] . After analyzing and quantifying ECs protrusion behavior ( Fig . 5A ) we observed that , similar to cells , single protrusions align strongly preferential along the microgroove direction , while they exhibit a random orientation when cells are on ﬂ at surfaces due to the lack of guiding signal ( Fig . 5B ) . Additionally , median protrusion orientation value was signi ﬁ cantly higher for young ECs than for old ECs , contrary to age - dependent cell directionality ( Fig . 5 B ) . Protrusion velocity was also analyzed on the same substrate conditions ( Fig . 5C ) . On the mi - crogrooved surface , EC protrusions of both age groups grew sig - ni ﬁ cantly faster than on ﬂ at surfaces . Moreover , protrusions of young ECs grew signi ﬁ cantly faster ( ~ 2 . 1 – 2 . 25 µm / min ) than those of old ECs ( ~ 1 . 8 – 1 . 9 µm / min ) on both surface conditions , suggesting a si - milar behavior in terms of age - dependent response than that for cell migration velocity ( Fig . 5C ) . EC protrusion length was also analyzed on the same aforementioned substrate conditions ( Fig . 5D ) . ECs protru - sions were found to grow signi ﬁ cantly longer on microgrooved surfaces than on ﬂ at ones . Furthermore , on both surface conditions young ECs protrusion length median values were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those for old ECs ( Fig . 5D ) . Altogether , these results show similarities be - tween ECs protrusions behavior and cell migration , regarding pre - ferential orientation along grooves and age - dependent velocity values . Since cell migration on microgrooved substrates was more con ﬁ ned along grooves than across them , we suggested that protrusion velocity and / or length could be also in ﬂ uenced by their angle with respect to microgrooves . Thus , we studied protrusion velocity and length vs the orientation . Fig . 6 and Fig . S5 show scatter plots of protrusion velocity and length over protrusion orientation of young and old ECs on D = 650 nm / W = 2 µm and ﬂ at surface , respectively . While on ﬂ at surfaces velocity and length values were rather homogeneously dis - tributed over the orientation values range ( Fig . S5 ) , on microgrooved surfaces more values closer to 1 ( parallel orientation ) were found in both age groups ( Fig . 6 ) . When comparing perpendicularly oriented protrusions , in this work considered as OP ≤ - 0 . 8 , with parallel or - iented protrusions , considered as OP ≥ 0 . 8 , no di ﬀ erences were found on ﬂ at surfaces , as expected , neither for protrusion velocity nor for protrusion length , in none of age groups ( Fig . S5 ) . On microgrooved substrates , velocity of protrusions growing perpendicular to the mi - crogrooves was not found to be signi ﬁ cantly di ﬀ erent to that of Fig . 2 .

Experimental Cell Research 374 ( 2019 ) 1 – 11 5 protrusions growing parallel , in none of age groups ( Fig . 6A and B , insert ) . Instead , protrusion length of young and old ECs was sig - ni ﬁ cantly higher when protrusions grew parallel to the microgrooves than when they grew perpendicular ( Fig . 6C and D , insert ) . Protrusion velocity and length of young and old ECs were also compared when protrusions grew perpendicular and parallel to the microgrooves ( Fig . 6E and F ) . Protrusion velocity of young ECs was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that of old cells , when protrusions oriented both perpendicular and parallel to microgrooves ( Fig . 6E ) . Protrusion length of young ECs was signi ﬁ cantly higher when protrusions were perpendicularly oriented to microgrooves . Instead , when they oriented parallel no age - dependent di ﬀ erences were observed ( Fig . 6F ) . These observations suggest that microgrooves do not reduce protrusion ex - tension velocity across them , but they act as a barrier limiting their length perpendicular to them , a ﬀ ecting more old ECs than young ones . 4 . Discussion In this work , we studied for the ﬁ rst time age - dependent migratory behavior of human endothelial cells on substrates with microgroove patterns of increased depth from 100 to 650 nm , which are within the range of some collagen bundles in vivo [ 46 ] , with 2 di ﬀ erent widths ( 2 Fig . 3 .

We used cells from donors of 2 di ﬀ erent age groups ( ≤ 31 and ≥ 60 years ) in order to have clearly separated ages among the samples that were commercially available . We observed age - dependent migration directionality ( Fig . 1G , H ) , velocity ( Fig . 1I , J ) , and persis - tence parameters ( Fig . 2 and Fig . S4 ) . While velocity of old cells was reduced independently of the substrate condition , age - dependent dif - ferences in all the other migration parameters depended on the sub - strate condition . Since actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in cell migration [ 42 , 47 ] , the decrease in persistence length across microgrooves with D ≥ 200 nm in old EC cells , and the probably consequent enhancement of directionality along microgrooves , suggests that actin cytoskeleton may be a ﬀ ected during aging . In previous works , it has been reported a less organized actin cytoskeleton [ 48 , 49 ] , and a decrease in F - actin quantity and cell sti ﬀ ness [ 28 ] in old ﬁ broblasts cells in comparison with young ones . However , in other studies cell sti ﬀ ening was observed in aged specimens , for instance in old human skin ﬁ broblasts [ 27 ] and in old monkey smooth muscle cells [ 50 ] . Cell sti ﬀ ening may be related to an increase of TNF - α levels , which increases with aging [ 51 ] . Indeed , TNF - α upregulates the expression of RhoA and increases the formation of actin stress ﬁ bers , leading to cell sti ﬀ ening [ 52 ] . In a work performed with human skin ﬁ broblasts , a faster cell reorientation perpendicular to the axis of cyclic uniaxial strain in old cells and young cells with knocked down F - actin [ 28 ] . Considering the relationship between cell sti ﬀ ness and quantity of F - actin [ 53 , 54 ] , we hypothesize that , a possible reduction in the amount of F - actin due to aging , could explain the en - hancement of EC directionality along microgrooves and the reduction of persistent displacement across them . However , this reduction in F - actin should not be strong since contact guidance is reduced after actin contractility inhibition , with the consequent depletion ( or strong re - duction ) of stress ﬁ bers [ 55 , 56 ] . Additionally , the increase in persis - tence time of old cells in comparison with young ones , leads us to hy - pothesize that some cell systems involved in migration steering could be a ﬀ ected by aging . The cell migration steering systems include the Fig . 4 . Analysis of cell morphology on the di ﬀ erent microgrooves and ﬂ at surfaces for young and old cells . The cell area ( A , B ) , cell elongation ( C , D ) and cell orientation ( E , F ) are compared for young “ Y ” and old “ O ” ECs for the di ﬀ erent microgrooved substrates ( four microgroove depths for depth W = 2µm and 10µm ) in comparison to ﬂ at surfaces . Between 100 and 150 cells from 2 to 3 independent experiments using di ﬀ erent donors , were analyzed for each experimental condition . The median is illustrated as a horizontal line in the middle of the box , the interquartile range is illustrated as the box , and the error bars correspond to one standard deviation . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was determined by the non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA test ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 ) . A . Sales et al . Experimental Cell Research 374 ( 2019 ) 1 – 11 7 actin cytoskeleton and the proteins involved directly or indirectly in actin polymerization and branching . Some relevant candidate proteins , due to their crucial role in cell migration steering , could be the Arp2 / 3 complex , which induces actin ﬁ laments branching , and its positive and negative regulators ( SCAR / WAVE and Arpin , respectively ) [ 57 , 58 ] . While we observed age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell directionality , we did not observe age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell orientation , except on 350 nm deep microgrooves ( Fig . 4E and F ) . The fact of considering two di ﬀ erent parameters , cell morphology in case of orientation and cell displacement in case of directionality , could give rise to the dif - ference observed in these two methods of measuring contact guidance . Moreover , the di ﬀ erence in cell mechanisms involved in orientation and the ones involved in migration directionality , could also play a role in the di ﬀ erence observed between the two methods to measure contact guidance . A possible explanation for the observation , might be given by the assumption that cell orientation ( alignment ) is predominately de - pendent on the overall structure of the cytoskeleton [ 15 , 55 ] , whereas migration depends more on local actin polymerization and retraction events [ 58 ] . Therefore , these di ﬀ erences between methods should be considered for each case when analyzing contact guidance and when extracting conclusions . Cell velocity was consistently reduced on cells from old donors ( Fig . 1I and J ) , independently of the surface structure . In other studies , age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell distance traveled for 5 days were observed on human microvascular ECs , where aged cells migrated less than young cells . However , cell aging was performed in vitro by pas - saging cells multiple times , which may di ﬀ er from cell aging in the organism ( i . e . in vivo ) [ 59 ] . Since in previous studies it was found a certain correlation between cell morphology and migration velocity [ 60 , 61 ] , we studied age - and microgroove size - dependent cell area and elongation . Although age - dependent di ﬀ erences in cell area were minor ( Fig . 4A and B ) , young cells elongation was typically greater than that of old cells on microgrooves ( Fig . 4C and D ) , which correlated to some extent with a higher velocity of young cells in comparison with old ones ( Fig . 1I and J ) . Previous works showed an increase of cell velocity in more elongated cells [ 60 , 61 ] , while another work showed no changes in velocity independently of the cell morphology [ 62 ] . This is probably due to cell type - di ﬀ erences and di ﬀ erences in migration mode . The measured cell migration velocities ( Fig . 5 ) were of the order of 2 – 2 . 5 µm / min which are very similar to those found in previous studies [ 63 , 64 ] . Interestingly , cell protrusion velocity in old cells was also re - duced ( Fig . 5C ) , independently of the surface condition similarly to cell velocity , indicating an altered actin polymerization e ﬃ cacy or reduced G - actin concentrations as observed in aged ﬁ broblasts [ 27 ] . Moreover , old cells protrusions were signi ﬁ cantly shorter in our studies when growing perpendicular to microgrooves ( Fig . 6F ) , since these may act as a barrier as we previously hypothesized [ 15 , 41 , 65 ] . In another study , it was hypothesized that a faster retraction of protrusions growing per - pendicular to nanogrooves may enhance cell alignment along them [ 66 ] . Considering this hypothesis , we believe that more hindered pro - trusions perpendicular to microgrooves could contribute to shorter cell displacements also in that direction , supporting thus our observation that old cells migration persistence length perpendicular to micro - grooves ( i . e . Y - axis ) is shorter than that of young cells ( Fig . 2D - F ) . Since Fig . 5 . Age - and substrate - dependent di ﬀ erences of cell protrusion orientation , velocity and length .

( B ) Protrusion orienta - tion , ( C ) velocity and ( D ) length were analyzed for young “ Y ” and old “ O ” ECs on D = 650nm / W = 2µm microgrooves , as well as on ﬂ at surfaces . For each experimental condition , a total of 600 protrusions of 30 cells from 3 in - dependent experiments using 3 di ﬀ erent donors , were analyzed . The median is illustrated as a horizontal line in the middle of the box , the interquartile range is illustrated as the box , and the error bars correspond to one standard deviation . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was determined by the non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA test ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 ) . The contrast and brightness of images was modi ﬁ ed . The cell contour was manually marked with a black line to better distinguish the cell and protrusion . Scale bar = 25µm . Scale bar of zoomed protrusion = 10µm . A . Sales et al . Experimental Cell Research 374 ( 2019 ) 1 – 11 8 ( caption on next page ) A . Sales et al . Experimental Cell Research 374 ( 2019 ) 1 – 11 9 cell protrusion growth is mainly driven by actin polymerization [ 3 , 42 , 45 ] , these observations brings us to hypothesize that actin poly - merization system , which plays an important role in cell motility and velocity [ 40 ] , could be a ﬀ ected by age . Contrary to cell directionality , protrusions of young cells oriented along microgrooves signi ﬁ cantly more than protrusions of old cells . That fact supports the hypothesis that actin polymerization system and F - actin network formation play a di ﬀ erent , although complementary , role in cell contact guidance [ 15 , 67 – 69 ] . 5 . Conclusions In this work , we quanti ﬁ ed for the ﬁ rst time age - dependent beha - viors of human endothelial cells , especially migration and protrusion formation on microgrooved substrates . We observed that cell direc - tionality , persistence and velocity were a ﬀ ected by age . Old ECs mi - grated more directional along microgrooves direction than young cells , on deep ( D ≥ 200 nm ) and narrow ( W = 2 µm ) microgrooves . Instead , old cells migrated always slower than young ones , independently of the substrate condition . Migration persistence length perpendicular to mi - crogrooves direction was reduced on old ECs on D ≥ 200 nm micro - grooves , in comparison to young ones , while persistence time in X and Y - axes was generally increased in old cells . In order to further char - acterize the cell behavior in the context of age - dependent cell migra - tion , we studied cell protrusions that are mainly driven by actin poly - merization . We observed a reduction of protrusions velocity and protrusions length , perpendicular to microgrooves , in old ECs in com - parison with young ones . However , unlike migration directionality , protrusions of young ECs oriented better along microgrooves than those of old ECs . These observations brought us to hypothesize that changes in F - actin network as well as in actin polymerization and steering ma - chinery take place during aging . Finally , the di ﬀ erent response of old ECs on migration directionality and protrusion orientation , points out the di ﬀ erent , but complementary , nature of both actin network and actin polymerizing systems in the cell migration process .
