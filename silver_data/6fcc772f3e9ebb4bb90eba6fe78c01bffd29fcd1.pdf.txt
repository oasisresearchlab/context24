Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive development , which can range from above average to intellectual disability ( ID ) 2 . While ASDs are known to be highly heritable ( ~ 90 % ) 3 , the underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown . Here , we analyzed the genome - wide characteristics of rare ( < 1 % frequency ) copy number variation ( CNV ) in ASD using dense genotyping arrays . When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1 , 287 matched controls , cases were found to carry a higher global burden of rare , genic CNVs ( 1 . 19 fold , Pinto et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t P = 0 . 012 ) , especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and / or intellectual disability ( 1 . 69 fold , P = 3 . 4×10 − 4 ) . Among the CNVs , there were numerous de novo and inherited events , sometimes in combination in a given family , implicating many novel ASD genes like SHANK2 , SYNGAP1 , DLGAP2 and the X - linked DDX53 - PTCHD1 locus . We also discovered an enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene - sets involved in cellular proliferation , projection and motility , and GTPase / Ras signaling . Our results reveal many new genetic and functional targets in ASD that may lead to final connected pathways . Twin and family studies indicate a predominantly genetic basis for ASD susceptibility and provide support for considering these disorders as a clinical spectrum . Some 5 – 15 % of individuals with an ASD have an identifiable genetic aetiology corresponding to known rare single - gene disorders ( e . g . , fragile X syndrome ) and chromosomal rearrangements ( e . g . , maternal duplication of 15q11 - q13 ) . Rare mutations have been identified in synaptic genes , including NLGN3 , NLGN4X 4 and SHANK3 5 , and microarray studies have revealed copy number variation ( CNV ) as risk factors 6 . CNV examples include de novo events observed in 5 – 10 % of ASD cases 7 – 9 , de novo or inherited hemizygous deletions and duplications of 16p11 . 2 9 – 11 and NRXN1 7 , and exceptionally rare homozygous deletions in consanguineous families 12 . Genome - wide association studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have highlighted two potential ASD risk loci at 5p14 . 1 13 and 5p15 . 2 14 , but these data suggest common variation will account for only a small proportion of the heritability in ASD . To further delineate the contribution of rare genomic variants to autism we genotyped 1 , 275 ASD cases and their parents using the Illumina Infinium 1M - single SNP - microarray ( Fig . 1 ) . A set of 1 , 981 controls used for comparison studies was genotyped on the same platform 15 and both data sets were subjected to the same quality control ( QC ) procedures . Ultimately , we analyzed 996 ASD cases ( 876 trios ) and 1 , 287 controls of European ancestry ( EA ) to minimize confounds due to population differences ( Supplementary Fig . 1 – 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ) 16 . Two CNV prediction algorithms ( QuantiSNP 17 and iPattern ( unpublished ) ) and additional extensive QC were used to establish a stringent dataset of non - redundant CNVs called by both algorithms in an individual ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . This stringent dataset of 5 , 478 rare CNVs in 996 cases and 1 , 287 controls of EA ( Supplementary Table 4 ) had the following characteristics : ( i ) CNV present at < 1 % frequency in the total sample ( cases and controls ) , ( ii ) ≥ CNV 30 kb in size ( because > 95 % of these could be confirmed ) and ( iii ) all CNVs further verified using combined evidence from the PennCNV algorithm 18 and child - parent intensity fold - changes , genotype proportions ( to verify deletions ) and visual inspection ( for chromosome - X ) . We assessed the impact of rare CNV in cases compared to controls using three primary measures of CNV burden : the number of CNVs per individual , the estimated CNV size , and the number of genes affected by CNVs ( Table 1 ) . No significant difference was found in the former two measures ( Supplementary Tables 4a and 5 ) , even after controlling for fine - level ancestry differences by pair - matching cases and controls ( Supplementary Information ) 16 . In contrast , we discovered a significant increase in the number of genes intersected by rare CNV in cases when focusing on gene - containing segments ( 1 . 19 - fold increase , empirical P = 0 . 012 ) . This ASD association with genic CNV was stronger for deletions ( 1 . 26 - fold increase , empirical P = 8 . 0×10 − 3 ) . These differences remained after we further controlled for potential case - control differences that could be present due to biological differences or technical biases . Restricting our analysis to autosomal CNVs ( ie . after removing CNVs located on chromosome X ) resulted in a consistent enriched gene count in ASD cases Pinto et al . Page 4 Nature .

Single - occurrence CNV deletions had increased rates in ASD over controls , suggesting some could be pathogenic . We then examined parent - child transmission and confirmed that 5 . 7 % ( 50 / 876 ) of ASD cases had at least one de novo CNV with > 0 . 6 % carrying two or more de novo events ( Supplementary Tables 4a , 6 and 7 ) . The de novo CNV rate in our simplex and multiplex families was 5 . 6 % ( 22 / 393 ) and 5 . 5 % ( 19 / 348 ) , respectively , in contrast with previous studies showing a higher rate in simplex families 8 , 9 . A total of 226 validated de novo ( 7 ) and inherited ( 219 ) CNVs not observed in controls and affecting single genes were found ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . Numerous novel candidate ASD loci such as SHANK2 , SYNGAP1 , and DLGAP2 , were identified based on the observation that de novo CNV affects these genes in cases and not controls ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . The relatedness of SHANK2 to the causal ASD gene SHANK3 5 , involvement of SYNGAP1 in ID 19 , and interaction of DLGAP family proteins with SHANK proteins 20 further support their role in ASDs . Maternally - inherited X - linked deletions at DDX53 / PTCHD1 ( 7 cases ) implicated this locus in ASD . We tested an additional 3 , 677 EA controls ( Fig . 1 ) and again found no CNV at these genes , and DDX53 / PTCHD1 emerged as a significant ASD risk factor ( P = 3 . 1×10 − 3 with the initial 1 , 287 controls ; P = 3 . 6×10 − 6 with combined controls ; Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Association studies of individual rare CNV often have insufficient power to discriminate benign from disease - causing variants . Here , we assessed whether genes and CNVs previously associated with ASD and / or ID were enriched in cases compared with controls , in order to help identify pathogenic events . We defined three gene - lists based on evidence from previous studies of their involvement in ASDs ( Supplementary Table 9 ) : ( i ) ‘ASD implicated’ list consisting of 36 disease genes and 10 loci strongly implicated in ASD and identified in subjects with ASD or ASD and ID ; ( ii ) ‘ID’ consisting of 110 disease genes and 17 loci implicated in ID but not yet in ASD ; and , ( iii ) ‘ASD candidates’ including 103 genes from previous studies of common and rare variants . We observed a higher proportion of cases with rare CNVs overlapping ‘ASD implicated’ disease genes compared to controls ( 4 . 3 % versus 2 . 3 % , Fisher exact test P = 5 . 4×10 − 3 ; Fig . 2a ) , corresponding to a significant enrichment for genes in this set ( OR = 1 . 8 ; 95 % CI 1 . 3 – 2 . 6 , empirical P = 2 . 6×10 − 3 ; Fig . 2b , see also Supplementary Information ) . This effect was stronger for duplications , which may also disrupt genes ( OR = 2 . 3 ; 95 % CI 1 . 4 – 3 . 8 , empirical P = 9 . 4×10 − 4 ) . Enrichment was also found for rare CNVs overlapping ID genes , more notably for deletions ( OR = 2 . 1 ; 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 4 . 2 , empirical P = 5 . 3×10 − 2 ) . In contrast , there was no evidence of enrichment among case - CNVs compared to control - CNVs for genes in the ‘ASD candidates’ set ( empirical P > 0 . 3 ) . When the two disease gene - sets ‘ASD implicated’ and ‘ID’ were combined , we observed 7 . 6 % of cases with rare CNVs preferentially affecting ASD / ID genes compared to 4 . 5 % in controls ( Fisher exact test P = 1 . 2×10 − 3 , Fig . 2a ) . The observed enrichments did not change when potential case - control genome - wide differences for CNV rate and size were considered . Our global analyses of these putative pathogenic loci use somewhat subjective boundaries for CNV overlap . Manual inspection of the data yields more accurate results . After eliminating CNVs that are less likely to have an aetiological role ( heterozygous CNVs that disrupt autosomal recessive loci , events outside the critical region of overlap of genomic disorders , X - linked genes in females inherited from non - ASD fathers , duplications inherited from non - ASD parents , and intronic CNVs in NRXN1 ) , 25 CNVs remained in the ASD group , compared to only four in the controls ( P = 3 . 6×10 − 6 ; Supplementary Table 10 ) . Moreover , the latter four CNVs were all duplications at 1q21 . 1 , 16p11 . 2 or 22q11 . 2 , loci Pinto et al . Page 5 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 January 16 .

The population attributable risk provided by the combination of all ASD - CNVs that overlap ASDs and / or ID genes is estimated to be 3 . 3 % ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . We also identified rare de novo chromosomal abnormalities and large CNVs likely to be aetiologic ( Supplementary Table 10 ) . We then tested for functional enrichment of gene - sets among those genes affected by CNVs to identify biological processes involved in ASD ( Fig . 3 ) . Here , the term gene - set refers to groups of genes that share a common function or operate in the same pathway . Such a functional enrichment mapping approach can combine single - gene effects into meaningful groups 21 . We compiled comprehensive collections of gene - sets ( Supplementary Table 12 ) and used the Fisher’s exact test to assess which gene - sets were more frequently affected by rare CNV events in ASD cases compared to controls . An estimate of the false - discovery rate ( FDR ) at each gene - set was obtained by random permutation of case and control labels ( Supplementary Information ) . To visualize enriched gene - sets , overlap scores were used to graphically organize these sets into a functional enrichment map ( or network ) using Cytoscape 22 . We identified the ‘seed’ genes for the network at an FDR q - value of 5 % and further relaxed the thresholds to 12 . 5 % to better capture the network topology 23 . Using these criteria only deletions were found significantly enriched in gene - sets in cases over controls ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , consistent with the global burden results ( Table 1 ) . Specifically , 76 gene - sets affected by deletions ( 2 . 18 % of sets tested ) were found enriched and used to construct a functional map ( Figure 3a , Supplementary Fig . 6 – 7 ) . We tested for possible bias , including measures of CNV size and number for cases versus controls per gene - set , as well as genome proximity , but no differences were found that might explain the observed enrichments ( Supplementary Fig . 8 – 9 ) . We identified enrichments in gene - sets known to be involved in ASDs and also discovered new candidate ASD pathways ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Table 13 ) . For example , gene - sets involved in cell and neuronal development and function ( including projection , motility , and proliferation ) previously reported in ASD - associated phenotypes , were identified 24 . Novel observations included gene - sets involved in GTPase / Ras signaling , with component Rho GTPases known to be involved in regulating dendrite and spine plasticity and associated with ID . We also found a tentative link to sets in the kinase activity / regulation functional group where only minorities of these sets meet a stringent 5 % FDR q - value threshold ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . We further assessed the relationship of our functional enrichment map with known ASD / ID genes ( Fig . 3b , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) and found genes enriched in sets linked to microtubule cytoskeleton , glycosylation and CNS development / adhesion 25 . The two groups of genes found enriched in deletions ( Fig . 3a ) also displayed connectivity to the ASD / ID disease gene - sets , either directly or through intermediates ( Fig 3b , Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Although ASD genes appear to be enriched in different subsets of genes compared to ID - only genes , we cannot discount the possibility that this is the result of selection bias , and we expect that more ID genes may yet be linked to ASD . Our findings provide strong support for the involvement of multiple rare genic CNVs , both genome - wide and at specific loci , in ASD . These findings , similar to those recently described in schizophrenia 26 , suggest that at least some of these ASD - CNVs ( and the genes that they affect ) are under purifying selection 27 . Genes previously implicated in ASD by rare variant findings have pointed to functional themes in ASD pathophysiology 6 , 28 .

Our data reveal SHANK2 , SYNGAP1 and DLGAP2 as new ASD loci , which also encode proteins in the PSD . We also found ID genes to be important in ASD 29 . Furthermore , our functional enrichment map identifies new groups such as GTPase / Ras , effectively expanding both the number and connectivity of modules that may be involved in ASD . The next steps will be to relate defects or patterns of alterations in these groups to ASD endophenotypes . The combined identification of higher - penetrance rare variants and new biological pathways , including those identified in this study , may broaden the targets amenable to genetic testing and therapeutic intervention . Methods Summary Cases were classified using the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised ( ADI - R ) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) instruments and those with known karyotypic abnormalities or genetic disorders were excluded . Informed consent was obtained from all families and procedures had approval from institutional review boards . DNA was obtained from blood or buccal - swabs ( 73 % of cases ; 75 % of controls ) or cell - lines ( 22 % of cases ; 25 % of controls ) ( in 5 % of cases the DNA source was not identified ) . The 1 , 287 EA controls passing all QC - filters included 1 , 261 individuals recruited as controls for the study of addiction ( SAGE ) 15 and 26 HapMap samples ( from Illumina ) . An additional 3 , 677 EA controls from three separate studies genotyped on other platforms were also used . Raw data from ASD family ( Accession pending ) and SAGE control ( Accession : phs000092 . v1 . p1 ) genotyping are at NCBI dbGAP . CNVs were analysed using PLINK v1 . 07 30 , R stats and custom scripts . Primary analyses were robust to potential systematic measurement differences between cases and controls ; it was not possible to control for site but we controlled for the overall extent and number of CNVs for all burden comparisons , and obtained a consistent enriched gene count in ASD cases compared to controls .

A functional map of ASD Enrichment results were mapped into a network of gene - sets ( nodes ) related by mutual overlap ( edges ) , where the color ( red , blue , or yellow ) indicates the class of gene - set . Node size is proportional to the total number of genes in each set and edge thickness represents the number of overlapping genes between sets . a , Gene - sets enriched for deletions are shown ( red ) with enrichment significance ( FDR q - value ) represented as a node color gradient . Groups of functionally related gene - sets are circled and labeled ( groups , solid line ; sub - groups , dashed line ) . b , An expanded enrichment map shows the relationship between gene - sets enriched in deletions ( panel a ) and sets of known ASD / ID genes . Node color hue represents the class of gene - set ( i . e . enriched in deletions , red ; known disease genes ( ie . ASD and / or ID genes ) , blue ; enriched only in disease genes , yellow ) . Edge color represents the overlap between gene - sets enriched in deletions ( green ) , from disease genes to enriched sets ( blue ) , and between sets enriched in deletions and in disease genes or between disease gene - sets only ( orange ) . The major functional groups are highlighted by filled circles ( enriched in deletions , green ; enriched in ASD / ID , blue ) . Pinto et al . Page 12 Nature .
