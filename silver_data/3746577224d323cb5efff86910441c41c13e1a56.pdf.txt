In addition to the Eps15 homology ( EH ) and Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains of intersectin - s , the neuronal variant ( intersectin - l ) also has Dbl homology ( DH ) , pleckstrin homology ( PH ) and C2 domains 1 , 3 – 7 . We now show that intersectin - l func - tions through its DH domain as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for Cdc42 . In cultured cells , expression of DH - domain - containing constructs cause actin rearrangements specific for Cdc42 activation . Moreover , in vivo studies reveal that stimulation of Cdc42 by intersectin - l accelerates actin assembly via N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex . N - WASP binds directly to inter - sectin - l and upregulates its GEF activity , thereby generat - ing GTP - bound Cdc42 , a critical activator of N - WASP . These studies reveal a role for intersectin - l in a novel mechanism of N - WASP activation and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Intersectin - s functions as a scaffolding protein in the formation of endocytic vesicles . Whereas the EH domains of intersectin - s target the protein to clathrin - coated pits 7 , its SH3 domains recruit dynamin to these endocytic structures 1 , 4 – 6 . Intersectin - l , an alterna - tively spliced form of intersectin - s , includes a carboxy ( C ) - terminal extension with a DH domain in tandem with a PH domain ( Fig . 1a ) , an organizational feature of GEFs that activate Rho family GTPases by catalysing the exchange of GDP for GTP 8 . Rho GTPases control a variety of cellular functions including membrane trafficking and axon guidance 9 , but are best characterized as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton 10 . Specifically , RhoA induces the formation of actin stress fibres and Rac1 and Cdc42 cause actin assembly , leading to the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia , respectively 10 . To explore the potential GEF function and substrate specificity of intersectin - l , we examined its binding to various GTPases in their nucleotide - free state , a condition under which GEF – GTPase interactions are most stable 11 . Green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusions encoding the DH – PH domains , the complete tail domain ( DH – PH – C2 ) or the isolated C2 domain ( Fig . 1a ) were expressed in cultured cells and tested for binding to RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins . The DH – PH and tail constructs , but not the C2 domain , bound to Cdc42 but not to RhoA , Rac1 or GST ( Fig . 1b ) . Conversely , Myc - tagged Cdc42 bound to GST – DH – PH – C2 and GST – DH – PH , but not to GST – C2 or GST alone ( see Supplementary Information ) . Furthermore , anti - GFP antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitated Myc - tagged Cdc42 along with a variety of DH - domain - containing GFP - tagged constructs , whereas no immunoprecipitation was seen with the iso - lated PH or C2 domains or with GFP alone ( Fig . 1c ) . Hence , the DH domain of intersectin - l binds specifically to Cdc42 . This inter - action is direct because purified Cdc42 cleaved from GST by thrombin binds to purified GST – DH – PH but not to GST alone ( Fig . 1d and data not shown ) . We next tested whether the nucleotide state of Cdc42 affected its interaction with intersectin - l . A GST construct encoding the isolat - ed DH domain bound strongly to wild - type , nucleotide - free Cdc42 , with moderate binding to the constitutively GDP - bound Cdc42N17 mutant and no binding to the GTPase - defective mutant Cdc42L61 ( Fig . 1e ) . The lack of binding of Cdc42L61 indicates that intersectin - l does not interact with the GTP - bound form of Cdc42 . This pattern is consistent with that seen for other GEFs in binding to their substrate GTPases 8 . To assess intersectin - l GEF activity directly , we followed the time - dependent incorporation of GTP - γ [ 35 S ] onto GDP - preloaded Cdc42 in the presence of GFP - tagged intersectin - l tail constructs immunoprecipitated from transfected cells . GFP – DH mediated significant GEF activity compared with that observed with GFP – PH , GFP alone or mock immunoprecipi - tates ( Fig . 1f ) . The activity of the isolated DH domain was consis - tently lower than that of constructs that also included the PH domain ( Fig . 1f ) . The amount of GFP construct added to the assays was assessed by anti - GFP western blots ( Fig . 1f ) . To test for intersectin - l GEF activity towards Cdc42 in intact cells , alterations in the actin cytoskeleton mediated by Cdc42 acti - vation were assessed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts 12 . Cells microinjected with an effector mutant of Cdc42 that is constitutively GTP bound but does not cascade to Rac activation ( Myc - Cdc42L61A37 ) 13 showed robust filopodium formation ( Fig . 2 ) , characteristic of Cdc42 activation 12 . By contrast , cells microinjected with Flag - tagged intersectin - s , which lacks the DH domain , had a similar morphology to non - injected cells . As predicted , cells expressing Flag – intersectin - l displayed extensive filopodia ( Fig . 2 ) . Intersectin - l expression was detected in filopodia , whereas a punc - tate staining pattern was observed for intersectin - s . To confirm that cytoskeletal reorganization induced by intersectin - l was mediated by Cdc42 , we injected intersectin - l along with a GST fusion protein encoding the Cdc42 / Rac interactive - binding motif ( CRIB ) of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , WASP ( ref . 14 ) . This domain binds specifically to GTP - bound Cdc42 and inhibits Cdc42 - induced signalling pathways 15 . Microinjection of WASP CRIB blocked filopodium formation induced by intersectin - l , showing the Cdc42 specificity of the observed effects ( Fig . 2 ) . No lamellipo - dia or stress fibres were observed after expression with the CRIB domain , as would be expected if intersectin - l also displayed GEF © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 OCTOBER 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 928 activity towards Rac1 or RhoA . The ability of intersectin - l to induce filopodia is localized to its DH domain , because cells microinjected with GFP – DH , GFP – DH – PH and GFP – DH – PH – C2 each pro - duced extensive filopodia ( see Supplementary Information ) . Although there was some degree of variability in cell shape after the injection of different DH - domain - containing constructs , similar variability was seen between cells injected with Myc - Cdc42L61A37 and , in all cases , filopodium formation was the salient morpholog - ical change ( Fig . 2 ) . Filopodia were detected in 94 ± 3 . 6 % of the cells injected with Myc - Cdc42L61A37 , whereas they were detected in only 11 ± 3 . 9 % of cells injected with intersectin - s . Intersectin - l expression caused 53 ± 6 . 6 % of the expressing cells to display filopodia , whereas this was reduced to 2 . 3 ± 2 . 3 % in cells also expressing the WASP CRIB domain . Each of the isolated tail constructs containing the DH domain dis - played greater activity than did full - length intersectin ( GFP – DH , 83 ± 7 % ; GFP – DH – PH , 77 ± 6 . 2 % , GFP – DH – PH – C2 , 77 ± 5 . 6 % ) . To test for intersectin - l GEF activity towards Cdc42 in a neu - ronal model , we used N1E - 115 neuroblastoma cells , which show Cdc42 - dependent neurite extension in response to serum starva - tion 16 , 17 . Five hours after serum withdrawal , a significantly higher proportion of cells expressing GFP – DH – PH – C2 elaborated neu - rites ( 38 . 3 ± 1 . 9 % ) than did cells expressing GFP alone ( 24 . 3 ± 0 . 9 % ) ( see Supplementary Information ) . Not only is activated Cdc42 nec - essary for neurite outgrowth in N1E - 115 cells but also its activation is sufficient to stimulate neurite outgrowth , even in the presence of serum 17 . GFP – DH – PH – C2 expression was sufficient to overcome serum - mediated suppression of neurite outgrowth because the proportion of cells elaborating neurites increased threefold in GFP – DH – PH – C2 - expressing cells ( 4 . 4 ± 0 . 2 % ) relative to GFP - expressing cells ( 12 . 5 ± 1 . 1 % ) ( see Supplementary Information ) . An important protein linking Cdc42 activation to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is the neuronal - enriched homologue of WASP , N - WASP ( refs 18 , 19 ) . N - WASP regulates actin polymeriza - tion by stimulating the actin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex 20 . To examine the effector pathway by which the GEF activity of intersectin - l mediates actin assembly in vivo , we used a recently developed actin nucleation assay based on permeabilized , acutely 1 21 310 359 659 710 1 , 2141 , 226 1 , 4441 , 4401 , 5731 , 5941 , 722 EHa , b EHa , b Coiled coil SH3A – E SH3A – E DH PH C2 Coiled coil Intersectin - s Intersectin - I DH DH – PH C2 DH – PH – C2 GFP – DH – PH GFP – C2 GFP – DH – PH – C2 a b 65 41 82 S M G S T – R ho A G S T – R a c 1 G S T - C d c 42 G S T GFP – DH – PH – C2 Anti - Cdc42 21 GFP – DH – PH – C2 GFP – DH – PH GFP – DH GFP GFP – PH Mock GFP – DH GFP – PH GFP – C2 GFP – DH – PH GFP SM GST GFP – DH S M V o i d G S T – D H – P H Anti - GFP Anti - Myc C d c 4 2 w t C d c 4 2L 61 C d c 4 2 N 17 S M I P S M I P 100 80 60 40 20 0 IP E xc hange a c t i v i t y ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) c d e f Time ( min ) 0 10 20 30 40 Figure 1 Intersectin - l has guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) activity towards Cdc42 . a , Structure maps of intersectin - s and intersectin - l .

When compared with a control ( GST alone ) , the addition of DH - domain - containing constructs stimu - lated actin nucleation , as indicated by robust increases in the num - ber of free actin barbed ends ( GST – DH – PH , 308 ± 30 % of control ; GST – DH , 179 ± 27 % of control ) ( Fig . 3 ) . The addition of 3 µ M CA , an N - WASP - derived peptide that inhibits N - WASP interactions with Arp2 / 3 and subsequent Arp2 / 3 - induced actin nucleation 21 , completely blocked ( 102 ± 30 % of control ) actin nucleation induced by GST – DH – PH ( Fig . 3 ) . Addition of the CA peptide in the absence of the DH – PH fusion protein had no effect on basal actin nucleation levels ( data not shown ) . Thus , intersectin - l regulates actin assembly by stimulating N - WASP - dependent activation of the Arp2 / 3 actin - nucleating complex . N - WASP contains multiple SH3 - domain - consensus binding sites 18 , raising the possibility that intersectin - l , a GEF for Cdc42 , interacts directly with N - WASP , a major Cdc42 effector protein 18 , 19 . To test for this interaction , we used pull - down assays with GST fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains of intersectin . GFP – N - WASP from transfected cells bound variably to the five SH3 domains with no binding to GST alone ( Fig . 4b ) . Similar results were obtained when examining endogenous N - WASP in pull - down assays from brain extracts ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , immunoprecipitated GFP - tagged N - WASP was readily detected by overlay with GST – SH3A of intersectin , whereas no bands were detected in immunoprecipitates from GFP - transfected cells or by overlay with GST alone ( see Supplementary Information ) . GST – SH3B of intersectin bound very weakly to N - WASP in over - lay and binding was only detected after extended exposure ( see Supplementary Information ) . These results show that intersectin - l interacts directly with N - WASP through selected SH3 domains . Following expression of GFP – N - WASP and Flag – intersectin - l in fibroblasts , immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a portion of the transfected cells had a highly punctate staining pattern for GFP – N - WASP that was partially localized with Flag – intersectin - l ( Fig . 4a ) . Co - staining with fluorescent phalloidin revealed that many of the structures displayed assembled actin adjacent to the N - WASP ( Fig . 4a ) . N - WASP has been previously reported to assemble actin on endocytic vesicles as a mechanism of vesicle propulsion 22 . Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GFP – N - WASP was specifically purified with Flag – intersectin - l after immunoprecipita - tion from fibroblasts ( see Supplementary Information ) . To examine the interaction of intersectin and N - WASP in vivo , we performed immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain extracts . An anti - body that recognizes both intersectin - s and intersectin - l ( 2173 ) immunoprecipitated both proteins from a Triton - X - 100 - solubilized membrane fraction and also led to the specific immunoprecipita - tion of N - WASP , whereas no N - WASP was purified in immunopre - cipitations performed with normal rabbit serum ( Fig . 4c ) . Intersectin did not purify with the abundant brain protein tubulin in the same experiment ( Fig . 4c ) . We next examined the relative distributions of intersectin and N - WASP in endocytic vesicles . A pool of intersectin - s and intersectin - l was found to distribute with N - WASP and actin in highly purified clathrin - coated vesicles pre - pared from rat brain ( Fig . 4d ) . By contrast , endophilin ( an abun - dant brain protein that is primarily soluble 23 ) was not associated with the purified clathrin - coated vesicles . Together , these data show that intersectin interacts specifically and directly with N - WASP both in vitro and in vivo . We next assessed the effect of N - WASP binding on intersectin - l function . In previous experiments , we showed that the isolated DH domain of intersectin - l interacts with the constitutively GDP - bound Cdc42N17 mutant ( Fig . 1e ) . Surprisingly , no immunoprecipitation of Myc - Cdc42N17 with Flag - tagged full - length intersectin - l was detected after transfection of the two constructs in fibroblasts ( Fig . ^ 5a ) . However , Cdc42N17 did immunoprecipitate with inter - sectin - l when the cells were also transfected with GFP – N - WASP ( Fig . 5a ) . As expected , Cdc42N17 did not immunoprecipitate directly with N - WASP ( Fig . 5a ) . Thus , N - WASP interactions with intersectin - l seem to stabilize the interaction of full - length inter - sectin - l with GDP - bound Cdc42 . In in vitro exchange assays , GFP – DH – PH strongly stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 compared with GFP alone , whereas GFP – intersectin - l ( in the presence of GST ) displayed a Non - injected Myc – Cdc42L61A37 Myc – Cdc42L61A37 Flag – intersectin - s Flag – intersectin - l Flag – intersectin - l & CRIB A n t i - F l ag P ha ll o i d i n P ha ll o i d i n Figure 2 Intersectin - l causes a Cdc42 activation phenotype in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and N1E - 115 neuroblastoma cells . Serum - starved sub - confluent Swiss 3T3 fibroblast were microinjected with mammalian expression constructs encoding a Myc - tagged mutant of Cdc42 ( Myc - Cdc42L61A37 ) , Flag - tagged inter - sectin - s and Flag - tagged intersectin - l , either alone or with a glutathione - S - trans - ferase ( GST ) fusion protein of the CRIB domain of WASP ( amino acids 201 – 321 ) . Microinjected cells expressing the proteins were revealed by indirect immunofluo - rescence with anti - Myc ( data not shown ) or anti - Flag antibodies and filamentous actin was detected by staining with TRITC - labelled phalloidin . ~ 50 cells were inject - ed per experiment for each construct ( at least three experiments for each con - struct ) .

This result is consis - tent with the earlier experiments showing that the isolated tail constructs of intersectin - l were more effective than the full - length protein at stimulating the formation of filopodia in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts . Our data suggest that N - WASP stabilizes intersectin - l – Cdc42 interactions , and so we examined whether the binding of N - WASP to intersectin - l affected its GEF activity . The addition of the isolated proline - rich domain of N - WASP ( amino acids 265 – 391 of rat N - WASP ) expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein ( GST – PRD ) caused a dose - dependent stimulation of guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 catalysed by intersectin - l ( Fig . 5b ) . Guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 was not enhanced by the addition of GST – PRD in the absence of GFP – intersectin - l ( Fig . 5b ) . The amount of intersectin - l added to each assay is estimated to be 1 µ M based on Coomassie Blue staining ( data not shown ) .

Collectively , our results suggest a model ( Fig . 5c ) in which N - WASP binding to intersectin - l enhances the ability of the DH domain to interact with GDP - bound Cdc42 and to catalyse its con - version to GTP - bound Cdc42 . Activated Cdc42 could subsequently interact with N - WASP to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucle - ation and assembly ( Fig . 5c ) . Thus , by regulating the enzymatic activity of intersectin - l , N - WASP might participate in its own acti - vation . This regulation of intersectin - l GEF activity is reminiscent of that recently described for p190RhoGEF ( ref . 24 ) . Although the isolated DH – PH domains of p190RhoGEF activate exchange on RhoA , the full - length protein has no effect , suggesting that the pro - tein requires as - yet - unknown binding partners to unmask its GDP and GTP exchange activity 24 . Similarly , the DH - domain - dependent GEF activity of both mSos and RasGRF1 are only seen upon their binding to regulatory signalling proteins 25 , 26 . Emerging data suggest a role for the actin cytoskeleton in synap - tic vesicle endocytosis 27 . Filamentous actin is most prominently detected in nerve terminals after treatments that lead to increased synaptic vesicle endocytosis 28 . Moreover , these actin networks are manifest in the area surrounding the active zone , a region special - ized for endocytosis 28 . Specialized sites of endocytosis dependent on the actin cytoskeleton have also been described in fibroblasts 29 and in Drosophila neuromuscular junctions 30 . In non - neuronal sys - tems , actin - rich networks referred to as ‘actin comet tails’ have been detected on endocytic vesicles in vitro 22 , 31 . The assembly of actin comet tails , which generate propulsive forces to drive endocytic vesicle transport , depends on the activation of N - WASP ( ref . 22 ) . Here , we show that intersectin - l stimulates actin assembly in an N - WASP - dependent manner . Thus , intersectin - l might function with N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 at an interface between the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles and the regulation of the actin cytoskele - ton . The yeast endocytic protein Pan1p has been recently shown to bind and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex directly 32 . Eps15 , the mam - malian homologue of Pan1p , forms heterodimers with intersectin 1 , further suggesting a link of intersectin to the actin regulatory machinery . Recent studies have identified several proteins that might function at an interface between endocytosis and actin regu - lation 27 . However , intersectin - l is the only described component of the endocytic machinery with an enzymatic activity directed towards actin assembly .

Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 245 , 000 g max for 15 min and the supernatants ( 800 µ gprotein ) were incubated with ~ 50 µ g of GST fusion protein constructs pre - coupled to glutathione – Sepharose beads . When GST – GTPases were coupled to glutathione – Sepharose ( see Supplementary Information ) , the beads were washed in 10mM EDTA before incubation with sol - uble extracts . GST – Cdc42 purified after bacterial expression was cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST tag and was then incubated with GST – DH – PH coupled to glutathione – Sepharose in NF buffer ( Fig . 1d ) . After incubation at 4 ° C , the beads were washed in NF buffer and specifically bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel sample buffer and processed for western blot analysis . Some assays were per - formed as described above except that cells were left in serum - containing medium and lysates were prepared in G buffer ( NF buffer with 10mM MgCl 2 substituted for 10mM EDTA ; Fig . 1e ) or lysates were made in L buffer ( 10mM HEPES , pH7 . 4 , containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 µ gml – 1 aprotinin , 0 . 5 µ gml – 1 leupeptin ; Fig . 4b ) . Overlay assays with GST fusion proteins were performed as described 35 . Immunoprecipitation assays . Soluble extracts were prepared from transfected cells in NF buffer ( Fig . 1c ) , L buffer ( see Supplementary Information ) or G buffer ( Fig . 5a ) as described above . The extracts were precleared by incubation with protein - A – Sepharose or protein - G – Sepharose beads before the addition of anti - GFP or anti - Flag antibodies , respectively , precoupled to the corresponding Sepharose beads . After a 2h incubation , the samples were washed in the corresponding buffer and proteins specifically bound to the beads were eluted and processed for SDS - PAGE and western blot or overlay analyses . Immunoprecipitation assays from brain extracts were performed as described previously 36 . Immunofluorescence of transfected cells . HEK - 293 cells were plated on poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips as previously described 7 . 48h after trans - fection , cells were fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde and processed for indirect immunofluorescence with various antibodies and for direct immunofluorescence with TRITC - conjugated phalloidin as described 37 . Images were captured with a scanning laser confocal microscope . In vitro exchange assays . 48h after transfection , HEK - 293 cells were processed in 0 . 5ml per 10cm 2 dish of lysis buffer ( 20mM Tris , pH7 . 5 , 100mM NaCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 µ gml – 1 aprotinin , 0 . 5 µ gml – 1 leu - peptin ) . The samples were sonicated and spun at 245 , 000 g max for 15 min and the supernatants were incubated with anti - GFP antibodies precoupled to protein - A – Sepharose . After an overnight incubation at 4 ° C , the beads were washed with assay buffer ( lysis buffer excluding Triton X - 100 ) . For assays per - formed in the presence of GST fusion proteins , immunoprecipitated beads were preincubated with purified fusion proteins for 2h at 4 ° C before performing exchange assays . Guanine - nucleotide exchange assays were performed essentially as described 38 . Briefly , 0 . 4 µ M purified , GDP - loaded Cdc42 was incubated with 5 µ M GTP γ [ 35 S ] ( 0 . 25mCimmol – 1 ) and the immunoprecipitated samples sus - pended in a final volume of 30 µ l in assay buffer containing 0 . 5mM DTT . At the indicated times , 5 µ l of the reaction was removed and passed through nitrocellulose filters , which were washed and counted using a liquid scintillation counter . Microinjection experiments . Sub - confluent , serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells plated on fibronectin were prepared as previously described 13 . The cells were injected with 0 . 15mgml – 1 of DNA . In some cases , DNA was injected with 0 . 6mgml – 1 purified GST – WASP - CRIB domain . Cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence with various antibodies and for direct immunofluorescence with TRITC - conjugated phalloidin as described 37 . Neurite outgrowth . N1E - 115 neuroblastoma cells were transfected with Optimem , 10 µ l of lipofectamine and 2 µ g of DNA . After 5h , the Optimemwas removed and replaced with DMEM culture medium containing 10 % foetal calf serum ( FCS ) . The cells were allowed to recover overnight and were then scraped into media con - taining 10 % FCS , triturated to obtain a suspension of single cells and plated on 35mm plates coated with laminin at a density of 2 × 10 4 cells per plate ( in DMEM with 10 % FCS ) . 2h later , the medium was switched to DMEM with 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin or cells were left in serum - containing medium . After a 5h incubation , the cells were fixed and transfected cells were identified by immunohistochemi - cal staining with anti - GFP antibody . For each dish , 200 transfected cells were identified , and the num - ber of neurites and the length of each neurite were recorded for each cell . The 200 cells were selected using a preset scanning pattern , such that the selected cells were evenly distributed over the dish . Data were recorded from each transfected cell that was encountered within this scanning pattern . A series of four dishes was used for each transfection . Actin nucleation assays . Actin nucleation was measured in permeabilized neutrophils as previously described 21 . The permeabi - lized cells were exposed to the various GST peptides ( 9 µ g in 300 µ l assay volume ) for 3min . Pyrene - labelled rabbit skeletal muscle G - actin 39 at 1 µ M was then added to start the assays and its assembly was monitored as a fluorescence increase at excitation and emission wavelengths of 366nm and 386 nm , respectively . To determine the contribution of actin filament barbed ends to the rate of fluores - cence increase , we added 2 µ M cytochalasinB to the assays and converted the data on the cytochalasin B sensitive actin assembly rate into the number of nucleation sites as described previously 39 . Purification of clathrin - coated vesicles . Subcellular fractionation of rat brain extracts to generate highly purified clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) was performed as described 40 .
