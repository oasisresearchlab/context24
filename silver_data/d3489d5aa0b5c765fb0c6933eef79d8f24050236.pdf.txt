One reason is that they are still poorly de ﬁ ned mechanistically . This situation calls for a better characterization of the molecular players involved , be they ele - ments of endocytic machineries or cargoes . Lately , key elements of these machineries have been identi ﬁ ed in the BAR domain protein family , which are specialized in membrane curvature induction and recognition 1 . In particular , proteins from the Endophilin - A ( endoA ) subfamily were shown to control the clathrin - independent uptake of various cargoes , such as β - adrenergic receptors , IL - 2 receptor 2 , 3 , or bacterial toxins 4 . Owing to their high sequence similarity , the three endophilin isoforms A1 – A3 are mostly considered as redundant . CD166 / ALCAM ( Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Mole - cule ) is a transmembrane immunoglobulin - like protein present at the cell surface . It is involved in cell – cell contacts through interactions with its ligand CD6 , present at the surface of T lymphocytes and other immune cells , as well as in homophilic interactions with other CD166 molecules present at the surface of adjacent cells 5 . It has functions in various processes , such as migration of monocytes across endothelia 6 , traf ﬁ cking of leuko - cytes into the central nervous system 7 , or activation of T cells 8 – 10 . Importantly , CD166 is overexpressed in various types of tumors where its expression level / cell surface abundance correlates with poor prognosis 11 – 16 . More recently , CD166 has been identi ﬁ ed as a cancer stem cell marker 12 , 17 , and proposed as a target for immunotherapy 18 – 22 . Despite its apparent importance in cancer progression , the traf ﬁ cking mechanisms regulating the home - ostasis of CD166 at the cell surface remain unknown . In this study , using proteomics and advanced imaging approaches , we demonstrate that CD166 is a clathrin - independent cargo . We show that the endoA3 isoform — but neither A1 nor A2 — functionally associates with CD166 - containing early endocytic carriers , and physically interacts with the cargo . Our data further demonstrate that the three endoA isoforms control the uptake of distinct subsets of cargoes . In addition , we provide strong evidence that the construction of endocytic sites from which CD166 is taken up in an endoA3 - dependent manner is driven by extra - cellular galectin - 8 according to the glycolipid – lectin ( GL – Lect ) mechanism . Taken together , our data reveal the existence of a previously uncharacterized clathrin - independent endocytic pro - cess controlled by galectin - 8 and endoA3 , essential for the downmodulation of the tumor marker CD166 at the cell surface . Importantly , we provide additional data suggesting that this endocytic modality regulates adhesive and migratory properties of cancer cells . Results Quantitative proteomics of cell surface upon CME inhibition . In order to discover clathrin - independent cargo proteins acting in cancer , we performed a quantitative proteomic screening for proteins whose cell surface exposure was unchanged or even decreased upon inhibition of CME ( Clathrin - Mediated Endocy - tosis ; Supplementary Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Data 1 ) . As expec - ted , canonical cargoes of CME , such as transferrin and LDL receptors , signi ﬁ cantly accumulated at the cell surface ( ~ 3 . 0 - to ~ 3 . 5 - fold increase ) , while the level of some previously described cargoes using CIE ( Clathrin - Independent Endocytosis , e . g . , CD44 ) or both CIE and CME ( e . g . , EGF receptor ) remained unchanged . These proteomic results were veri ﬁ ed by Western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . Surprisingly , the cell surface expression of several proteins was decreased , one of the strongest hits being CD166 ( ~ 2 . 8 - to ~ 3 . 4 - fold decrease ; Supplementary Fig . 1a , d ; Supplementary Data 1 ) . CD166 ( also termed ALCAM for Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule ) is a cell surface transmembrane immunoglobulin - like protein expressed by antigen - presenting cells . Although CD166 gene expression is decreased upon CME inhibition ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) , it does not explain the even stronger decrease in the protein at the plasma membrane that was observed in the proteomic analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , d ; Supplementary Data 1 ) . We therefore considered that an alternative clathrin - independent endocytic process responsible for CD166 uptake might be upregulated 23 . Hence , this hit appeared as a candidate of interest for further studies . CD166 is a clathrin - independent cargo . To con ﬁ rm that CD166 is a CIE cargo , we measured its uptake upon inhibition of CME , obtained by treating cells with siRNAs against µ2 - adaptin , cla - thrin heavy chain , or dynamin - 2 . In all these conditions , the uptake of anti - CD166 antibody remained unaffected , while the endocytosis of transferrin was strongly inhibited ( Fig . 1a – c ) . Similar results were obtained with acute inhibition of CME by the drug ikarugamycin ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) or the knocksideways technique ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Hence , rather than the upregulation of CIE of CD166 , we propose that CME inhibition switches the post - endocytic traf ﬁ cking of CD166 from recycling to the lysosomal degradation route . Such a crosstalk between CIE and CME has previously been proposed for other clathrin - independent cargoes 24 . In addition , continuous co - incubation of cells with ﬂ uorescently labeled anti - CD166 antibody and trans - ferrin clearly showed that both cargoes do not co - localize during the ﬁ rst 5 min of endocytosis ( Fig . 1d ) . Similarly , anti - CD166 antibody did not present any obvious co - localization with µ2 - adaptin or clathrin light chain over time , in contrast to transferrin ( Supplementary Fig . 2c – h ) . To get deeper insight into CD166 endocytosis under unperturbed live - cell imaging conditions , and on the full 3D volume of cells , we performed lattice light - sheet microscopy - based experiments to follow the uptake of anti - CD166 antibody in genome - edited clathrin - mRFP cells . We quanti ﬁ ed 639 endocytic events ( Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 ) . Highly sensitive detection , advanced event tracking , and statistical analysis of con ﬁ ned ﬂ uorescent spots over time ( Supplementary Fig . 2i ) indicated that 69 . 9 % of CD166 uptake events did not co - localize with clathrin ( Fig . 1e , f ; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 ) . By contrast , 71 . 2 % of transferrin uptake events were clathrin - positive ( Fig . 1g , h ) . Altogether , these data clearly demonstrate that the tumor marker CD166 is largely and preferentially endocytosed in a clathrin - and dynamin - independent manner . Speci ﬁ c function of endoA3 in CIE of CD166 . In order to further characterize the molecular mechanisms of CD166 uptake , we focused on the endophilin - A ( endoA ) family of BAR domain proteins , which together with other members of the BAR domain protein superfamily , have already been implicated in CIE 2 – 4 , 25 – 27 . Interestingly , a strong inhibition of CD166 uptake was observed upon depletion of the A3 isoform of endophilin - A ( endoA3 ) in HeLa cells , while no effect was observed upon depletion of the two other isoforms ( Fig . 2a ; Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Using isoform - speci ﬁ c antibodies , we analyzed the expression level of each endoA in the various siRNA - treatment conditions ( Sup - plementary Fig . 3b ) . Plotting the relative expression levels of each endoA isoform versus the amount of endocytosed CD166 in these various conditions indicated a strong and signi ﬁ cant linear cor - relation with the expression of endoA3 , but not with the two other isoforms ( Fig . 2b : linear regressions : endoA1 ( R 2 = 0 . 2666 ) and endoA2 ( R 2 = 0 . 06904 ) , slopes not signi ﬁ cantly different from zero with F tests ; endoA3 ( R 2 = 0 . 9566 ) , slope signi ﬁ cantly different from zero ( P < 0 . 0001 ) with F test ) . Similarly , a speci ﬁ c ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1457 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications inhibition phenotype of CD166 uptake was observed upon endoA3 depletion in U2OS cell line ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . In addition , overexpression of endoA3 — but not endoA2 — sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased the uptake of CD166 in HeLa cells ( Supple - mentary Fig . 3d ) . Interestingly , exogenous expression of endoA3 in LB33 - MEL cell line — that does not endogenously express endoA3 ( see Supplementary Fig . 4e ) — strongly restored CD166 uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 3e ) . Of note , combined depletion of endoA3 and clathrin heavy chain in HeLa cells did not show further inhibition of CD166 uptake in our experimental condi - tions ( Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . To generalize our ﬁ ndings , we tested several cell lines naturally expressing endoA3 , and found that the cellular abundance of CD166 protein increased upon endoA3 depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 4a – c : HeLa , HMC3 , and U2OS , respectively ) . As expected , no change was observed in endoA3 - negative cell lines ( Supplementary Fig . 4d , e : SUM159 AP2 - GFP , LB33 - MEL , and MZ - 2 - MEL . 43 , respectively ) . This observation suggests a stabilization of CD166 at the cell surface in the absence of endoA3 . This was con ﬁ rmed by surface staining and ﬂ ow cytometry analyses in HeLa and U2OS cell lines ( Sup - plementary Fig . 4f , g ) , as well as by Western blotting on enriched cell surface protein fractions in HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) . Taken together , these data show that the endocytosis of CD166 is speci ﬁ cally controlled by endoA3 , but not endoA1 and endoA2 , suggesting that the different isoforms have cargo - speci ﬁ c functions . A closer observation of CD166 and endoA isoforms in super - resolution Airyscan confocal microscopy revealed the speci ﬁ c association of CD166 - positive endocytic structures with endoA3 , but not A1 or A2 isoforms in various cell types ( Fig . 2c : HeLa ; Supplementary Fig . 5a , b : BSC - 1 and HMC3 , respectively ) . This association was further con ﬁ rmed by STED microscopy where early endocytic structures containing anti - CD166 antibody were clearly positive for GFP - tagged endoA3 ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Spinning - disk live - cell imaging provided a dynamic view of CD166 uptake process in endoA3 - positive tubular invaginations emanating from the cell surface ( Supplementary Fig . 5d , white arrows ; Supplementary Movies 3 and 4 ) . Some ﬁ ssion events could also be observed ( Supplementary Movie 5 ) . TIRF imaging of live cells showed that GFP - labeled endoA3 has a very short lifetime at the cell surface , as ~ 90 % of spots lasted for less than 30 s ( Supplementary Fig . 5e – g , green bars on the histogram ) . Interest - ingly , endoA3 became much less dynamic at sites of CD166 clustering , as ~ 80 % of endoA3 spots had a lifetime exceeding 50 s and often the total duration of our 120 - s movies ( Supplementary Fig . 5e – g , red bars on the histogram ; Supplementary Movie 6 ) . a 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 Transferrin * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Time ( min ) E ndo cy t o s i s ( % o f t o t a l ) 0 10 20 30 40 0 20 40 60 80 100 anti - CD166 siCtrl siAP2M1 NS NS NS NS Time ( min ) E ndo cy t o s i s ( % o f t o t a l ) d b Time ( min ) 0 10 8 6 4 2 – 20 20 40 60 80 100 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Transferrin IB : anti - Dynamin IB : anti - α - Tubulin 95 55 kDa s i C t r l s i DN M 2 130 E ndo cy t o s i s ( % o f t o t a l ) s i C t r l s i AP 2 M 1 IB : anti - α - Tubulin IB : anti - α - Adaptin 95 55 130 c IB : anti - Dynamin IB : anti - α - Tubulin 95 55 180 kDa s i C t r l s i C L T C s i DN M 2 IB : anti - CHC 130130 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 T o t a l i n t e r na l f l uo r e sc en c e ( % o f s i C t r l a t 10 m i n ) NS NS NS NS * * * * s i C t r l s i C L T C s i DN M 2 s i C t r l s i C L T C s i DN M 2 10 min 30 min kDa e anti - CD166 CLTA g 1 I n s e t s 2 anti - CD166 Tf - A488 1 2 ClathrinCD166 N o r m a li z ed f l uo . i n t en s i t y ( A .

Similarly , very dynamic patterns were previously observed for endoA2 in the absence of cargoes , such as Shiga Toxin B - subunit ( STxB ) 4 and ligand - stimulated β - adrenergic receptors 3 . This speci ﬁ c association of endoA3 with CD166 - containing endocytic structures suggested a possible physical interaction between both proteins . To address this question , we performed pull - down experiments from HeLa cell lysates using the cytosolic tail of CD166 as a bait . Interestingly , we could pull down endoA3 , but not endoA2 ( Fig . 2d ) . This interaction is apparently weak , which likely re ﬂ ects a transient association of the two proteins . Of note , we could also pull down ezrin — used here as a positive control — for which the interaction with the cytosolic tail of CD166 has previously been documented 28 . Together with the functional analyses , these co - localization and physical interaction data further highlight the speci ﬁ c association of CD166 endocytosis with endoA3 , but not endoA1 or endoA2 . Distinct endocytic functions of endoA isoforms . In order to further investigate these distinct endocytic functions of endoA isoforms , we performed experiments with previously described CIE cargoes whose uptake depends on endoA proteins . Previous studies have shown that endoA2 mediates the uptake of the bacterial STxB by controlling ﬁ ssion 4 , 29 . Others have found that CIE of endogenous cargoes , such as IL - 2 or β - adrenergic recep - tors , is controlled by endoA proteins , which was termed Fast Endophilin - Mediated Endocytosis ( FEME ) 2 , 3 . Although these studies mainly focused on endoA2 , they mostly consider the three endoA isoforms as redundant , which is understandable in view of 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 NS * * * * NS NS NS * * * * P = 0 . 0202 ( * ) T o t a l i n t e r na l f l uo r e sc en c e ( % o f s i C t r l a t 10 m i n ) s i C t r l s i E ndo A 1 s i E ndo A 2 s i E ndo A 3 s i C t r l s i E ndo A 1 s i E ndo A 2 s i E ndo A 3 a 10 min 30 min c 30 35 40 45 50 – 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 CD166 endocytosis after 40 min ( % of total ) E x p r e ss i on l e v e l ( f r a c t i on o f m a x i m u m s i gna l ) EndoA1EndoA2EndoA3 b e g anti - EndoA1 anti - EndoA2 EndoA3 - GFP Overlay an t i - E ndo A 1 an t i - E ndo A 2 E ndo A 3 - G F P anti - CD166 Overlay Endophilin f anti - β 1AR Overlay Endophilin an t i - E ndo A 2 E ndo A 3 - G F P d kDa G S T - CD 166 G S T I npu t ( 1 . 5 % ) 2734 IB : anti - EndoA3 IB : anti - GST 2734 95 IB : anti - Ezrin IB : anti - GST 95 2734 IB : anti - EndoA2 IB : anti - GST 72 9572 R e l a t i v e f l uo r e sc e n c e i n t en s i t y o f S T x B - C y 3 i n pe r i nu c l ea r G o l g i a ft e r 45 m i n endo cy t o s i s ( % o f s i C t r l ) 0 25 50 100 75 125 150 P = 0 . 1743 ( NS ) s i C t r l s i E ndo A 1 s i E ndo A 2 s i E ndo A 3 0 E ndo A 1 E ndo A 2 E ndo A 3 E ndo A 2 i n E ndo A 1 CHC i n DN M 2 E ndo A 3 i n E ndo A 1 E ndo A 3 i n E ndo A 2 5 10 15 C o l o c a li z a t i on o f CD 166 po s i t i v e s t r u c t u r e s w i t h i nd i c a t ed endo A i s o f o r m s ( % ) * * * * * * * * NS 0 5 10 15 20 EndoA2 EndoA3 Colocalization of β 1AR postive structures with indicated endophilin isoforms ( % ) * * * * 0 10 20 30 40 50 C o l o c a li z a t i on ( % ) * * * * P = 0 . 0039 ( * * ) P = 0 . 8935 ( NS ) h n = 91 n = 78 n = 73 n = 95 n = 100 n = 72 n = 78 n = 109 Fig . 2 Endophilin - A3 controls the clathrin - independent uptake of CD166 .

First , we observed the intracellular transport of the B - subunit of STxB upon depletion of each individual endoA isoform ( Fig . 2e ; Sup - plementary Fig . 7a ) . As expected , the knockdown of endoA2 s - trongly inhibited retrograde STxB traf ﬁ cking from the cell surface to perinuclear Golgi , while no effect was observed for the depletion of A3 isoform . Co - localization experiments indicated that the long plasma membrane invaginations induced by STxB were devoid of CD166 ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . Likewise , co - uptake of the canonical FEME cargo β 1 - adrenergic receptor with anti - CD166 antibodies showed a poor overlap between the two markers ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . By contrast with CD166 that clearly co - localized with endoA3 but not the A2 isoform , β 1 - adrenergic receptor revealed the exact mirror phenotype , i . e . , co - localization with endoA2 , but not endoA3 ( Fig . 2f ) . Interestingly , the cellular localization of the three endoA isoforms , as observed by confocal , STED , or TIRF microscopy — using isoform - speci ﬁ c antibodies for endoA1 and endoA2 , and a low expression of GFP - tagged endoA3 — revealed a very poor overlap of the three pat - terns ( Fig . 2g , h ; Supplementary Fig . 7d , e ) . In addition , endoA3 showed very little co - localization with clathrin heavy chain or dynamin - 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 8a - d ) , and the lifetime at the plasma membrane for endoA3 spots ( ~ 10 s ) was much shorter than that of the two CME markers ( > 20 s ; Supplementary Fig . 8e , f ; Supplementary Movies 7 and 8 ) . Moreover , the uptake of transferrin was not affected by endoA3 depletion ( Supple - mentary Fig . 8g , h ) . Together , these data demonstrate that endoA isoforms do not co - localize and control distinct endocytic pro - cesses for speci ﬁ c subsets of cargoes . More speci ﬁ cally , they underline the previously unrecognized role of endoA3 isoform in a distinct CIE mechanism , whose ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed cargo is CD166 . Interestingly , speci ﬁ city in this endocytic modality may come from direct interaction between the cytosolic tail of CD166 and endoA3 isoform . Role of galectin - 8 in endoA3 - dependent uptake of CD166 . Next , we investigated if extracellular factors could also control CD166 endocytosis in concert with endoA3 . CD166 protein is heavily glycosylated , and previous reports have shown that it is a strong and speci ﬁ c binding partner of the mammalian lectin galectin - 8 ( Gal8 ) 30 , 31 . According to the glycolipid – lectin ( GL – Lect ) hypothesis , galectins co - cluster glycosylated cell sur - face cargo proteins and glycosphingolipids to drive the formation of tubular endocytic pits from which morphologically distinct endocytic structures termed CLICs ( clathrin - independent car - riers ) are formed for the cellular uptake of these cargoes 32 . A previous study reported on the galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) - driven CIE of CD44 and β 1 - integrin via this mechanism 33 . To address the role of galectins in the uptake of CD166 , we ﬁ rst assessed the effect of N - Acetyl - D - lactosamine ( LacNAc ) — a strong competitor for the binding of galectins to carbohydrates on proteins or lipids — on the process . Interestingly , the uptake of anti - CD166 into cells is reduced by ~ 60 % in the presence of 10 mM LacNAc in the culture medium ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) , suggesting that CD166 uptake is driven by galectins , Gal8 being the most likely candidate . In addition , we depleted glycosphingolipids by a 2 - day incubation of cells with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor Genz - 123346 34 , 35 , and we observed an ~ 50 % reduction of anti - CD166 uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 9b , top - right panel ) . Of note , Gal3 and Tf uptake was used as controls of GL – Lect and non - GL – Lect cargoes , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 9b , bottom - left and bottom - right panels , respectively ) . Ef ﬁ ciency of Genz treatment was also veri ﬁ ed by the loss of STxB binding to the cell surface ( Supplementary Fig . 9b , top - left panel ) . Next , we performed anti - CD166 antibody uptake assays in the presence of puri ﬁ ed galectins . We observed a clear co - localization of Gal8 with anti - CD166 in endocytic structures ( Fig . 3a ) . By contrast , co - localization of anti - CD166 with Gal1 ( for which no speci ﬁ c interaction with CD166 could be detected 31 ) was much lower and used as a negative control ( histogram of Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Fig . 9c ) . Of note , anti - CD166 did not show any signi ﬁ cant co - localization with Gal3 , a previously described marker of some CLIC populations 33 , 36 ( Supplementary Fig . 9d ) . Strikingly , anti - CD166 antibody uptake was reduced by 50 % in cells that were depleted of endogenous Gal8 by RNA interference , and cultured in serum - free medium ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Fig . 9e ) . The uptake of CD166 was rescued by the addition of exogenous puri ﬁ ed Gal8 at doses as low as 0 . 2 nM ( Fig . 3b ) . This observation is consistent with previously published concentration ranges of exogenous Gal3 required to rescue the uptake of CD44 on Gal3 - depleted cells 33 . These nanomolar concentrations are also in line with the amount of Gal8 and other galectins found in the serum of healthy individuals and cancer patients 37 , 38 . Toge - ther , these data demonstrate that the endocytosis of CD166 is dependent on Gal8 and glycosphingolipids , a typical feature of endocytic processes that operate according to the GL – Lect hypothesis . Next , we investigated the connections between Gal8 and endoA3 . After 10 min of endocytosis in cells expressing GFP - tagged endoA3 , we observed a signi ﬁ cantly higher number of co - localization events with Gal8 than with Gal1 ( Fig . 3c ; Supple - mentary Fig . 9f ) . The same cells observed by TIRFM indicated a co - localization of Gal8 and endoA3 at the cell surface ( Supplementary Fig . 9g ) . Of note , combined depletion of endoA3 and Gal8 did not further reduce CD166 uptake , suggesting that they are functionally involved in the same mechanism ( Supple - mentary Fig . 9h ) . In order to scrutinize this association in a dynamic manner , we used a highly innovative device composed of a Fluid - FM — an instrument combining micro ﬂ uidics and AFM ( atomic force microscopy ) — coupled to a fast - scanning confocal microscope ( Fig . 3d ) . Gold nanoparticles functionalized with ﬂ uorescently labeled Gal8 or Gal1 were trapped at the apex of the Fluid - FM probe and subsequently approached to cells expressing GFP - tagged endoA3 in a force - controlled manner , thus achieving spatially and temporally resolved cell stimulation . Strikingly , we observed a signi ﬁ cant increase in GFP signal at the plasma membrane around the nanoparticle within 60 s after contact only when it was coated with Gal8 ( Fig . 3e , f ; Supplementary Movie 9 ) . Gal1 - coated nanoparticles , uncoated nanoparticles ( labeled with a control dye ) , or bare ﬂ uid - FM probes did not induce any signi ﬁ cant recruitment of endoA3 to plasma membrane ( Fig . 3f ; Supplementary Fig . 9i – k ; Supplementary Movies 10 – 12 ) . Of note , we did not observe any recruitment of GFP - tagged endoA2 with Gal8 - coated nanoparticles ( Fig . 3f ; Supplementary Fig . 9l ; Supplementary Movie 13 ) . These data indicate that extracellular Gal8 induces the fast and speci ﬁ c recruitment of endoA3 to uptake sites at the plasma membrane . Role of CD166 / endoA3 in cancer cell adhesion and migration . To place these ﬁ ndings in the broader context of cancer cell physiology , we decided to investigate how modulation of CD166 surface abundance by this new endocytic modality impacts two important features of cancer cells : migratory and adhesive properties . Previous studies have shown that a reduced expression of CD166 decreases cancer cell tumorigenicity and proliferation , while it favors migration 39 . In addition , several studies have shown that endoA3 - expressing cancers have bad prognosis , as it is correlated with an increase in cancer cell pro - liferation and migration 40 – 42 . Recently , Poudel et al . 43 have shown that endoA3 promotes growth and migration of colon NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1457 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 cancer cells via two competing mechanisms : an endocytic mechanism that is required for proliferation , and the activation of Rac1 GTPase through interaction with TIAM1 GEF for cell migration . Impaired balance between those two mechanisms may favor hyperproliferative versus pro - metastatic phenotypes in vivo . Here , in addition , we propose that expression of endoA3 activates an endocytic mechanism that enables cancer cells to down - modulate cell surface proteins , such as CD166 , which would allow them to tune their migratory and adhesive properties . This endocytic modality would further contribute to hyperproliferative and / or pro - metastatic phenotypes . To address this hypothesis , we analyzed the migration capacity of cancer cells in wound - healing assays . As expected , the depletion of endoA3 strongly reduced gap closure speed by a factor of 4 , compared with the control condition in U2OS cell line ( Fig . 4a , b ; Supplementary Movie 14 ) . Strikingly , in the absence of CD166 , depletion of endoA3 did not have any additional effect on gap closure ( Fig . 4a , b ; Supple - mentary Movie 14 ) . This result indicates that the migratory phenotype caused by the absence of endoA3 is tightly dependent on the presence of CD166 . In order to extract more information from these wound - healing assays , we performed single - cell tracking analyses ( Fig . 4c – e ; Supplementary Fig . 10a ) . We clearly observed that endoA3 depletion strongly reduces the migration velocity of individual cells at the edge of the wound ( Fig . 4c , siEndoA3 condition ; Fig . 4d , blue bar ) . Interestingly , the depletion of CD166 had little impact on the migration velocity ( Fig . 4c , siCD166 condition ; Fig . 4d , green bar ) . Furthermore , in the context where CD166 is absent , additional depletion of endoA3 did not further affect cell migration velocity ( Fig . 4c , siCD166 / siEndoA3 condition ; Fig . 4d , red bar ) . Of note , in all conditions , the directionality of migration toward the wound ( measured with xFMI , Fig . 4e ) and the Euclidian distance ( Sup - plementary Figure 10a ) were signi ﬁ cantly decreased by compar - ison with the control condition . Accumulated tracks ( Fig . 4c ) depict clearly the loss of directionality and distance traveled by cells when endoA3 is depleted ( siEndoA3 condition ) , while it is almost exclusively a loss of directionality when CD166 is deple - ted , whether endoA3 is present or not ( siCD166 and siCD166 / siEndoA3 conditions ) . Western blot analyses on U2OS extracts showed that all siRNA depletions were remarkably ef ﬁ cient ( Supplementary Fig . 10f ) . Altogether , these data further underline that the phenotype of endoA3 depletion requires the presence of CD166 . We performed additional wound - healing assays with other cancer cell lines that do not express endoA3 or CD166 ( SUM159 wild type ; Supplementary Fig . 10b , g ; Supplementary Movie 15 ) , or that express CD166 but not endoA3 ( genome - edited clone of SUM159 expressing AP2 - GFP ; Supplementary Fig . 10c , g ; Gal8 - Cy3 Overlay anti - CD166 a b Gal8 - Cy3 Overlay EndoA3 - GFP e E ndo cy t o s ed an t i - CD 166 ( % o f s i C t r l + 10 % F BS ) 0 25 50 100 75 125 150 175 NSNS NS * * * * * * * * 10 % FBS Gal8 ( nM ) siCtrl siGal8 + – + – – – – – – – – 0 . 2 2 20 f c HeLa cells Confocal microscope endoA3 - GFP Photodiode Laser Gal8 - Cy3 gold beads Mirror MicrochanneledAFM cantilever Reservoir Pressure d Time ( s ) I n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) 10 20 30 40 50 0 0 20 40 60 t = 0 sec t = 15 sec t = 30 sec t = 60 sec I n s e t + TL EndoA3 - GFP t = 0 s e c G a l 8 - C y 3 G a l 8 ( n = 10 ) G a l 1 ( n = 10 ) B a r e p r o b e ( n = 5 ) D y e c t r l ( n = 5 ) G a l 8 ( n = 10 ) – 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 G F P f l uo r e sc en c e ( s l ope ) EndoA3 - GFP EndoA2 - GFP 0 10 20 30 40 50 Colocalization of CD166 with the indicated galectins after 10 min uptake ( % ) Gal8 Gal1 * * * * Number of endoA3 - GFP - positive structures colocalizing with the indicated galectins ( per cell ) 0 50 100 150 200 Gal8 Gal1 * * * * P = 0 . 1675 ( NS ) P = 0 . 4277 ( NS ) P = 0 . 0004 ( * * * ) P = 0 . 27 ( NS ) P = 0 . 2514 ( NS ) P = 0 . 1969 ( NS ) P = 0 . 0015 ( * * ) P = 0 . 0095 ( * * ) * * * * n = 211 n = 104 n = 169 n = 180 n = 94 n = 92 n = 100 Fig . 3 Galectin - 8 drives the uptake of CD166 and induces the recruitment of Endophilin - A3 to endocytic sites at the plasma membrane .

As expected , transfection with siRNAs against endoA3 , CD166 , or a combination of both , had no signi ﬁ cant impact on gap closure speed ( Supplementary Fig . 10b , c ) . We also performed wound - healing assays with LB33 - MEL cells , that do not express endoA3 endogenously , but express CD166 . Interestingly , re - expression of exogenous endoA3 in LB33 - MEL increased gap closure speed compared with wild - type cells ( Supplementary Fig . 10d , e ; Supplementary Movie 17 ) . As a reminder , this re - expression of endoA3 also restored CD166 uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 3e ) . Taken together , these data show that the strong effect on gap closure observed in U2OS cell line upon endoA3 depletion is directly connected to the expression / function of the protein , and is not an off - target of siRNA treatment . More importantly , re - expression of endoA3 increases migration capacities of cancer cells that do not express the protein naturally , and this can be correlated with a restoration of CD166 uptake . Upon depletion of endoA3 ( where cells dramatically lose migration velocity and directionality , which in turn strongly reduces gap closure speed in wound - healing assays , see Fig . 4a – e ) , we observed that CD166 accumulates at the cell surface ( Supplementary Fig . 4f – h ) .

We next aimed to examine if modulation of CD166 surface level by endoA3 - dependent CIE could affect intercellular adhesion . In order to address this question , we tested cell – cell adhesion using a previously described ﬂ ipping assay 44 , 45 , in which cells in suspension adhere to a monolayer of adherent cells ( Supplementary Fig . 10h ; see Methods section for more information ) . First , we observed the adhesiveness of cells treated with negative control siRNA , or siRNAs against CD166 , endoA3 , or a combination of both , to a wild - type ( untreated ) con ﬂ uent cell layer ( Supplementary Fig . 10i ) . This experiment clearly showed that a lack of CD166 signi ﬁ cantly decreases intercellular adhesions . In a second experiment , we compared the adhesiveness of cells treated with siRNAs to a con ﬂ uent layer of cells treated with the same siRNAs ( Fig . 4g ) . Interestingly , we observed a signi ﬁ cant increase in intercellular adhesiveness upon endoA3 depletion , as compared with control condition . These variations of intercellular adhesion correlate with the variations of CD166 abundance at the cell surface . In other words , upon endoA3 depletion , the higher amount of CD166 at the cell surface increases intercellular adhesiveness , which results in slower movements and loss of directionality of individual cells . This may explain why gap closure in wound - healing assays is strongly impaired in the absence of endoA3 compared with control condition in U2OS cells . On the other hand , in the absence of CD166 , the reduced intercellular interactions only result in a loss of directionality , with a very minor effect on migration velocity of individual cells . This may explain why gap closure is only slightly affected in these conditions . However , the very strong effect of endoA3 depletion on cell migration requires the presence of CD166 . We conclude that endoA3 - dependent CIE downmodulates CD166 from the cell surface , which reduces intercellular adhesion . Conversely , when endoA3 is depleted , CD166 accumulates at cell – cell junctions , resulting in stronger intercellular adhesion and reduced migration capacity of cells . Altogether , these observations indicate that ﬁ ne - tuning of CD166 at the cell surface by endoA3 - dependent CIE can be used by cancer cells to modulate intercellular adhesiveness , and ensure optimal collective migration with the highest speed and directionality . Discussion Our study challenges the current prevailing view that the three endophilin - A isoforms are functionally redundant in CIE . Our observations reveal the existence of a previously uncharacterized clathrin - independent endoA3 - dependent endocytic process , which should be distinguished from endoA2 and the previously described FEME pathway 2 – 4 ( Fig . 4h ) . The data presented here provide strong evidence that endoA isoforms have distinct loca - lizations at the plasma membrane and control the uptake of different subsets of cargoes from the cell surface . We have demonstrated that the tumor marker ALCAM / CD166 is a CIE cargo that is internalized in an endoA3 - dependent manner . Pull - down data indicated that the speci ﬁ city of endoA3 in the uptake of CD166 arises from physical interaction , although we cannot exclude the role of microdomains / lipids in the recruitment mechanism of the BAR domain protein . The exact mechanism through which endoA3 controls CD166 uptake remains unclear . Further insights into these mechanistic aspects will require more investigations , such as by mapping of interaction surfaces and generation of mutants disrupting this association . In addition , we identi ﬁ ed Gal8 as a driver for the recruitment of endoA3 to uptake sites at the plasma membrane , and the endocytosis of CD166 . The mammalian lectin Gal3 was previously proposed to promote the formation of endocytic invaginations by clustering glycosylated cargoes ( CD44 and integrins ) and glycosphingolipids at the cell surface 33 , termed the GL – Lect mechanism 32 . This mechanism also operates in the case of Gal8 - driven uptake of CD166 , as we provided data showing that glycosphingolipids play a crucial role here . Our study is the ﬁ rst to identify a BAR domain protein module — namely endoA3 — that directly acts on a galectin - induced endocytic process . It should also be noted that the process we describe here shares striking similarities with the GL – Lect - dependent uptake of the bacterial lectin Shiga toxin 46 , which induces the formation of plasma membrane invaginations that are recognized and processed by endoA2 4 . Additional investigation will be necessary to see if endoA3 also enables friction - driven scission , as described for endoA2 4 , 29 . Furthermore , it should be determined which other cargoes require endoA3 for their uptake , and whether other galectins also drive these endoA3 - dependent uptake events . Finally , our study integrates endoA3 / Gal8 / CD166 endocytosis in a broader biolo - gical context , as the data suggest that it controls the homeostasis of CD166 at the cell surface in cancer cells , which can directly modulate their ability to adhere to neighboring cells and to migrate . Overall , our ﬁ ndings seem to indicate that cancer cells are able to tune their own migratory properties through the activation of speci ﬁ c CIE machineries . Nevertheless , the identi - ﬁ cation of additional endoA3 / Gal8 cargoes will help to better understand the role of this endocytic modality in the behavior of cancer cells . In particular , it will be important to elucidate how Gal8 and other galectins interfere with cell adhesion and migra - tion when CD166 is expressed . Based on our ﬁ ndings , future research in physiologically relevant in vivo models should help to decipher the role of this endocytic modality in cancer development .

HeLa ( human cervix adenocarcinoma , ATCC ® CCL - 2 ) , MEF 33 , 36 ( mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts ) , BSC - 1 ( green monkey normal kidney , ATCC ® CCL - 26 ) , U2OS ( human osteosarcoma , ATCC ® HTB - 96 ) , and genome - edited U2OS CLTA - mRFP , HMC3 ( immortalized human microglia , ATCC ® CRL - 3304 ) , SUM159 wild - type , and genome - edited SUM159 AP2 - eGFP ( human breast carci - noma ) were grown at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 in DMEM high glucose glutamax ( Gibco , 61965 - 059 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100Uml − 1 penicillin , 100µgml − 1 streptomycin , and 1mM pyruvate . Genome - edited SUM159 AP2 - eGFP and U2OS CLTA - mRFP cell lines were gifts from T . Kirchhausen ( Harvard Medical School ) and D . Drubin ( University of California , Berkeley ) , respectively . HeLaM cells stably expressing Mito - YFP - FRB and α - adaptin - FKBP were provided by M . S . Robinson ( Cambridge Institute for Medical Research ) , and were grown at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 in DMEM high glucose glutamax ( Gibco , 61965 - 059 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100Uml − 1 penicillin , 100µgml − 1 streptomycin , 1mM pyruvate , and 137 . 5µgml − 1 hygromycin B . Human cell line LB33 - MEL was derived in 1988 from melanoma patient LB33 47 . This cell line was cultured in Iscove Medium ( Gibco , 12440 - 053 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 0 . 55 mM L - Arginine , 0 . 24 mM L - Asparagine , 1 . 5mM Glutamine ( AAG ) , 0 . 75mM β - Mercaptoethanol , 100Uml − 1 penicillin , and 100µgml − 1 streptomycin , and was grown at 37°C under 8 % CO 2 . Human cell line MZ - 2 - MEL . 43 was derived from melanoma patient MZ - 2 48 . This cell line was cul - tured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 0 . 55 mM L - Arginine , 0 . 24 mM L - Asparagine , 1 . 5mM Glutamine ( AAG ) , 100Uml − 1 penicillin , and 100µgml − 1 streptomycin , and was grown at 37°C under 8 % CO 2 . HeLa and LB33 - MEL cells stably expressing endoA3 - GFP were generated for this study ( see below ) , and grown in the same medium as the mother cell line , supplemented with 0 . 125mgml − 1 and 0 . 7mgml − 1 G418 , respectively . DNA constructs and transfection . Expression plasmids for C - terminally GFP - tagged rat endoA2 ( P . De Camilli , Yale School of Medicine ) and human endoA3 ( H . T . McMahon , MRC , Cambridge ) , mCherry - tagged µ2 subunit of AP2 ( C . Merri ﬁ eld , CNRS — i2BC , Gif - sur - Yvette ) , and mRFP - tagged dynamin - 2 ( T . Kirchhausen , Harvard Medical School ) , were kindly provided by the indicated colleagues . In order to visualize endoA3 in microscopy , a C - terminally GFP - tagged human endoA3 construct was engineered with the aim to generate a stable HeLa cell line . For this , human endoA3 sequence was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR from the previous expression plasmid ( forward primer with A ﬂ II restriction site : 5 ′ - GCGCTTAAG ATGTCGGTGGCCGG - 3 ′ ; reverse primer with EcoRI restriction site : 5 ′ - CCGG AATTC GAAGCTTCTGAGGTAAAGGCACGA - 3 ′ ) . To obtain the ﬁ nal construct , rat endoA2 and human endoA3 sequences were swapped in the bicistronic vector pIRESneo2 encoding endoA2 - GFP - FKBP generated in our previous study 4 between A ﬂ II and EcoRI restriction sites . Correct clones were validated by sequencing . For pull - down assays , a GST - tagged CD166 tail construct was generated . CD166 cytoplasmic tail sequence was ampli ﬁ ed by PCR from a C - terminally GFP - tagged human CD166 expression plasmid ( J . Weiner , University of Iowa ) ( forward primer with EcoRI restriction site : 5 ′ - GGAATTCTACATGAAGAAGTCAAAG - 3 ′ ; reverse primer with XhoI restriction site : 5 ′ - CCGCTCGAGTTAGGCTTCAGTT TTGTG - 3 ′ ) . To obtain the ﬁ nal construct , ampli ﬁ ed CD166 tail sequence was inserted in the pGEX - 4T1 expression plasmid ( GE Healthcare ) encoding for GST between EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites . Correct clones were validated by sequencing . For immuno ﬂ uorescence and live - cell imaging experiments , plasmids were transfected with FuGene HD ( Promega ) in HeLa and HCM3 cells , or with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) in BSC - 1 cells , according to the manufacturers ’ instructions . Cells were used for experiments 16 – 24h after transfection . For the production of HeLa and LB33 - MEL cell lines stably expressing endoA3 - GFP , pIRESneo2 / endoA3 - GFP – FKBP expression plasmid was transfected by nucleofection ( Amaxa Nucleofector 2b , Lonza ) and electroporation ( BTX Gemini X2 System ) , respectively . A selection pressure was imposed with 0 . 8 and 0 . 7mgml − 1 G418 during 7 – 15 days for HeLa and LB33 - MEL cell lines , respectively . At the end of the selection process , stable HeLa endoA3 - GFP clones were isolated by single - cell sorting based on GFP ﬂ uorescence using FACSAria III ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) . For stable LB33 - MEL endoA3 - GFP cell line , the total cell population resistant to G418 was recovered ( no clone selection ) , and ﬂ ow cytometry measurements indicated that 100 % of cells were GFP - positive . Stable HeLa and LB33 - MEL endoA3 - GFP cell lines were then maintained in the continuous presence of 0 . 125 and 0 . 7mg ml − 1 G418 , respectively . RNA interference . siRNAs used in this study were purchased from Qiagen and transfected with HiPerFect ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , except for BSC - 1 cells that were transfected twice ( on day 0 and day 1 ) to reach ef ﬁ cient knockdown . Experiments were always performed 72 h after siRNA transfection , where protein depletion ef ﬁ ciency was maximal as shown by immunoblotting analysis with speci ﬁ c antibodies ( routinely 80 – 100 % ) . For most experiments , cells were replated 24 h before use , according to the needs of the experiment . AllStars Negative Control siRNA served as a reference point . The depletion of each endoA isoform was achieved with two different sequences , used as a pool or individually , at a total ﬁ nal concentration of 20 or 40 nM : endoA1 # 1 ( SI04149411 : 5 ′ - AAAGACTCTTTGGACATAGAA - 3 ′ ) , endoA1 # 2 ( SI04260949 : 5 ′ - AAATCTGGTATCCAAGCTTA A - 3 ′ ) , endoA2 # 1 ( SI03057250 : 5 ′ - CACCAGC AAGGCGGTGACAGA - 3 ′ ) , endoA2 # 2 ( SI03073931 : 5 ′ - CATGCTCAACACGGT GTCCAA - 3 ′ ) , endoA3 # 1 ( SI04170376 : 5 ′ - CCAGACGAGAATACAAGC CAA - 3 ′ ) , and endoA3 # 2 ( SI04176529 : 5 ′ - CCAGACGAAGAAGTCAGACAA - 3 ′ ) . For µ2 - adaptin depletion , a single siRNA sequence at a ﬁ nal concentration of 20 or 40 nM was used ( SI02777355 : 5 ′ - TGCCATCGTGTGGAAGATCAA - 3 ′ ) . For galectin - 8 , a smartpool of four siRNA sequences at 40 nM was used : Gal8 # 1 ( SI04336612 : 5 ′ - AACCCACGCCTGAATATTAAA - 3 ′ ) , Gal8 # 2 ( SI04340028 : 5 ′ - TCGGACTTA CAAAGTACCCAA - 3 ′ ) , Gal8 # 3 ( SI03237339 : 5 ′ - TGGACGAACTGTCGTCGTT AA - 3 ′ ) , and Gal8 # 4 ( SI04356506 : 5 ′ - AAGGTTGCAGTAAATGGCGTA - 3 ′ ) , except for Supplementary Fig . 9h where only sequences # 1 and # 2 were used ; for clathrin heavy chain , a smartpool of four siRNA sequences at 40nM ( SI00299873 : 5 ′ - AAGGAGAGTCTCAGCCAGTGA - 3 ′ ; SI00299880 : 5 ′ - TAATCC AATTCGAA GACCAAT - 3 ′ ; SI04152372 : 5 ′ - AAGGGCTAACGTCCCAAATAA - 3 ′ ; SI04190417 : 5 ′ - CCCTGAGTGGTTAGTCAACTA - 3 ′ ) ; for dynamin - 2 , a smartpool of four siRNA sequences at 40 nM ( SI02654687 : 5 ′ - CTGCAGCTCATCTTCTCAAAA - 3 ′ ; SI03233671 : 5 ′ - TCGCAACCTGGTGGACTC ATA - 3 ′ ; SI04224591 : 5 ′ - CTCATAC GTGGCCATCATCAA - 3 ′ ; SI04277546 : 5 ′ - CCCGCTGGTCAAC AAACTGCA - 3 ′ ) ; for ALCAM / CD166 , three siRNA sequences were used at a ﬁ nal total concentra - tion of 20 or 40nM : CD166 # 1 ( SI02780162 : 5 ′ - CACCTGCTCGGTGACATAT TA - 3 ′ ) , CD166 # 2 ( SI02780169 : 5 ′ - AAGCATGAACGTGGATTGTAT - 3 ′ ) , CD166 # 3 ( SI03030286 : 5 ′ - AACGTGTTTGAGGCACCTAC A - 3 ′ ) . For the analysis of CD166 in cell lysates ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , a smartpool with the three sequences was used . For wound - healing assays ( Fig . 4a – e and Supplementary Fig . 10a – c , f , g ) , a smartpool with sequences # 1 and # 2 only was used . Recombinant protein production . Recombinant wild - type STxB was puri ﬁ ed from bacterial periplasmic extracts as previously described 49 .

For further details , see Supple - mentary Methods . Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of cell surface . Cell surface proteins were isolated using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and digested by trypsin . Peptides were labeled with iTraq reporters and subjected to quantitative proteomic analysis . For further details , see Supplementary Methods . Quanti ﬁ cation of gene expression by qPCR . For further details , see Supple - mentary Methods . Light microscopy . For immuno ﬂ uorescence studies , cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 – 20min ( Figs . 2c , e – h , 3c , 4f ; Supplementary Figs . 2c – h , 5a – c , 7a , b , d , e , 8a – d , 9f ) or on ice for 10min followed by an additional 10 min at room temperature ( Figs . 1c , d , 2a , 3a , b ; Supplementary Figs . 3c , e , f , 7c , 8h , 9a – d , h ) , depending on the requirements of each experiment . After quenching with 50 mM NH 4 Cl for at least 15min and permeabilization with saponin ( 0 . 02 % saponin , 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ) for 30min , both at room temperature , cells were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 30 – 60 min , and mounted with Fluoromount G ( Invitrogen ) . Fixed samples were imaged with a 34 - channel Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with Airyscan system and with a Plan Apo 63× numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 4 oil immersion objective . Wide - ﬁ eld images were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 epi ﬂ uorescence microscope equipped with a C - Apo 40× NA 1 . 2 water immersion objective and an ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 LT sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . STED ( stimulated emission depletion ) super - resolution images were acquired on an easy3D STED microscope ( Abberior Instruments GmbH ) equipped with 100× NA 1 . 4 oil immersion objective . Plasma membrane images of ﬁ xed samples were also acquired by TIRF microscopy , using a Nikon TIRF Ti - E inverted microscope equipped with a CFI Apo TIRF 100× NA 1 . 49 oil immersion objective and an EMCCD Evolve camera ( Photometrics ) . Of note , those speci ﬁ c samples were conserved and imaged in PBS after immuno ﬂ uorescence , rather than Fluoromount G that is not suitable for TIRFM . For live - cell imaging , cells were grown to subcon ﬂ uence on chambered glass coverslips ( µ - slides with glass bottom , Ibidi ) . Observations were made at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . In the absence of CO 2 - level maintenance , culture medium was buffered with 25mM Hepes . Different imaging devices were used . Plasma membrane images were acquired on the same Nikon TIRF microscope as described above . Other live - cell images were acquired on a Zeiss Cell Observer Spinning Disk confocal device equipped with a Plan Apo 100× NA 1 . 4 oil immersion objective and an AxioCam MRm ( Zeiss ) . Montages , kymographs , and movies were prepared with Fiji software ( NIH ) . In addition , TIRF and spinning - disk images NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1457 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 ( Supplementary Figs . 5d , 7e , 8a – c , 9g ) were processed with the Fiji plugin “ A trou Wavelet ” ( at default parameters ) and then smoothed to improve contrast . Live - cell lattice light - sheet microscopy . Genome - edited U2OS cells ( CLTA - mRFP ) were plated 20 h before imaging on 5 - mm - diameter # 1 . 5 coverglass . Cells were incubated for 1min with anti - CD166 - Atto647N antibody ( 5µgml − 1 ) or with transferrin - Atto647N ( 50 nM ) at 21 °C in lattice light - sheet imaging media ( phenol red - free DMEM , high glucose , glutamax , supplemented with 1 % BSA , 0 . 01 % penicillin – streptomycin , 1mM pyruvate , and 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) ) . The cov - erslips were transferred to the lattice light - sheet microscope ( LLSM ) coverslip holder and inserted into the imaging chamber containing lattice light - sheet ima - ging media in the absence of CO 2 at 30 °C ( for increased stability of the optical system ) . Imaging started within 2 – 3 min . Lattice light - sheet microscopy was per - formed on a commercialized instrument of 3i ( Denver , USA ) , previously descri - bed 50 . Cells were scanned incrementally through a 20 - µm - long light sheet in 600 - nm steps using a fast piezoelectric ﬂ exure stage equivalent to ∼ 325nm with respect to the detection objective , and were imaged using a sCMOS camera ( Orca - Flash 4 . 0 ; Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) . Excitation was achieved with 560 - or 642 - nm diode lasers ( MPB Communications ) at 20 % acousto - optic tunable ﬁ lter trans - mittance with 100mW initial box power through an excitation objective ( Special Optics 28 . 6× 0 . 7 NA 3 . 74 - mm water - dipping lens ) , and detected via a Nikon CFI Apo LWD 25× 1 . 1 NA water - dipping objective with a 2 . 5× tube lens . Lattice light - sheet imaging was performed using an excitation pattern of outer NA equal to 0 . 55 and inner NA equal to 0 . 5 . Composite volumetric datasets were obtained using 20 - ms exposure / slice / channel at a time resolution of 3 s per cell volume ( 60 slices ) . Fifty time points were acquired per cell . Acquired data were analyzed using an adapted version of cmeAnalysis3D software published previously 51 . It can be found as part of the Github repository of llsmtools in https : / / github . com / francois - a / llsmtools / . cmeAnalysis3D was implemented in Matlab 2018a . Quanti ﬁ cation of LLS images was performed on raw images ( see Supplementary Methods ) . Imaris 9 . 3 was used for the LLSM visualization and video rendering . Fluid - FM coupled to fast - scanning confocal microscope . For the dynamic study of endoA3 localization to the site of galectin exposure , we used a combined instrument , made up of a Fluid - FM setup ( Cytosurge ) coupled to a Bruker Resolve AFM and to a Zeiss LSM880 fast - scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Plan Apo 63× numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 4 water immersion objective . Twenty - four hours before the experiment , HeLa cells expressing endoA3 - GFP were seeded on glass - bottom petri dishes . Just before the experiments , cells were incubated for 30min at 37°C in lactose buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 150mM lactose , 45 mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1mM CaCl 2 ) to strip galectins of the cell surface , and subsequently kept in serum - free culture media at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for all the durations of the experiment . In a typical live - cell experiment , a suspension of gold beads ( 10 5 nanoparticles ml − 1 in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) , functionalized with the ﬂ uorescently labeled Gal8 and Gal1 or with the control dye ( ﬂ uorescent nanoparticle without protein coating ) , was placed on a glass - bottom petri dish and imaged with the confocal device . For experimental details on the coating of nanoparticles , see Supplementary Methods . A Fluid - FM microchanneled cantilever was approached to the surface of the petri and used to trap individual functionalized gold beads , by applying a steady negative pressure of − 800mbar through the micro ﬂ uidics system . Using the force control of the Bruker Resolve atomic force microscope , the cantilever with the trapped functionalized nanoparticle was then approached to the membrane of individual endoA3 - GFP - expressing HeLa cells by applying a 10nN initial force that was subsequently decreased to 5nN and kept constant over time . In parallel , the focal plane of the confocal device was focused on the bead , and 60 - s time series were recorded in fast - scanning mode to monitor endoA3 - GFP ﬂ uorescence variations in the surroundings of the bead . A control experiment in which the cells were approached by bare Fluid - FM probes ( with no trapped nanoparticle ) was also carried out . Flow cytometry . For uptake assays by loss of surface ( Figs . 1a , b , 2b ; Supple - mentary Figs . 2a , b , 3a , d , 8g ) and other cell surface analyses ( Supplementary Fig . 4f , g ) , measurements were made with a Guava easyCyte ( Merck - Millipore ) ﬂ ow cytometer ( 10 , 000 or 30 , 000 cells counted per condition ) . Flow cytometry was set up and gated as described in Supplementary Fig . 12 . For the generation of the stable HeLa endoA3 - GFP cell line , single - cell sorting in 96 - well plates was per - formed with a FACSAria III ( BD Biosciences ) . Knocksideways . The knocksideways of α - adaptin was performed as described previously 52 . Uptake assays . Cells transfected with speci ﬁ ed siRNAs or plasmid constructs were seeded in 4 - or 24 - well plates , 16 – 24 h before the experiment , in order to reach subcon ﬂ uence the day of the experiment . In the following steps , culture medium was always buffered with 25 mM Hepes , and supplemented with 10 % FBS for anti - CD166 uptake , but kept serum - free for transferrin , galectin , or β 1 - adrenergic receptor uptake . Loss of surface assays in ﬂ ow cytometry . In the case of anti - CD166 uptake , cells were pre - incubated for 30min at 37 °C in fresh serum - containing culture medium just before the experiments , while this step was skipped for transferrin . Plates were then transferred on ice , and cells were washed with ice - cold culture medium . Anti - CD166 antibody ( 5 µgml − 1 ) or biotinylated transferrin ( Tf - Biot , 10 µgml − 1 ) were bound to the cell surface on ice in culture medium for 30min . After washes to remove unbound ligands , cells were put back to 37°C in pre - warmed culture medium to induce endocytosis for various time lapses . One sample was kept on ice as 0 - min time point , giving the total cell surface abundance of each cargo ( or 0 % endocytosis ) . Endocytosis was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing with ice - cold PBS + + containing 0 . 2 % BSA . Residual cell surface - accessible anti - CD166 antibody or Tf - Biot ( corresponding to non - endocytosed fractions ) were detected with a Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled secondary antibody or streptavidin , respectively . After extensive washes with ice - cold PBS , cells were detached by incubation on ice in PBS containing 4mM EDTA for 10 – 15 min . Cell suspensions were kept on ice until measurements by ﬂ ow cytometry ( 10 , 000 cells for each condition ) . For both cargoes , the percentage of endocytosis at each time point was derived from the fraction of the remaining cell surface signal reported to the total surface signal at time 0 . For gating strategies , see Supplementary Fig . 12 . Continuous uptake in immuno ﬂ uorescence . For anti - CD166 antibody uptake alone , cells were pre - incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in fresh serum - containing medium just before experiments . In the particular case of uptake experiments under glycosphingolipid depletion , cells were pretreated for 2 days with 5 µM Genz - 123346 , and serum concentration was reduced to 5 % to reduce salvation pathways in glycosphingolipid biosynthetic processes . For transferrin uptake alone or co - uptake with anti - CD166 antibody , cells were pre - incubated for 30min at 37 °C in serum - free medium just before experiments . For co - uptake experiments of anti - CD166 antibody and ﬂ uorescently labeled Gal1 , Gal3 , or Gal8 , cells were pre - incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in lactose buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM lactose , 45mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM CaCl 2 ) just before experiments to strip off galectins present in the cellular environment . Endocytosis was then triggered by incubating cells at 37 °C in the continuous presence of anti - CD166 antibody ( 5 µgml − 1 ) and / or ﬂ uorescently labeled transferrin ( Tf - A488 , 10 µgml − 1 ) or ﬂ uorescently labeled Gal1 / Gal3 / Gal8 ( Gal1 - Cy5 , Gal3 - A488 , and Gal8 - Cy3 , 50nM ) in pre - warmed culture medium for various time lapses . Endo - cytosis was stopped on ice , and unbound ligands were removed by extensive washes with ice - cold PBS + + . An additional step of three 5 - min washes on ice with lactose buffer was added in the experiments with Gal1 / Gal8 to strip off residual galectin signal from cell surface . Residual cell surface - accessible anti - CD166 anti - body or Tf - A488 were stripped by three 20 - s acid washes on ice ( 200mM acetic acid , pH 2 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 5mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 1mM MgCl 2 ) 2 . After neutralization by extensive washes with ice - cold PBS + + , cells were ﬁ xed , per - meabilized , incubated with primary and / or secondary antibodies if necessary , and mounted as previously described ( see the “ Light microscopy ” section ) . Of note , for co - localization experiments with endoA isoforms , acid and lactose washes were skipped and replaced by a quick wash at 37°C with pre - warmed PBS , and cells were subsequently ﬁ xed for 10 – 20min at 37°C in order to keep the integrity of endoA signal distribution . In addition , in the absence of a functional antibody against endoA3 in immuno ﬂ uorescence , cells were transfected with an endoA3 - GFP con - struct 16 – 24h before experiments . Samples were imaged , and co - localization or internalized ﬂ uorescent signals was quanti ﬁ ed as explained below . Of note , the ef ﬁ ciency of acid washes of anti - CD166 antibody was observed in immuno - ﬂ uorescence and quanti ﬁ ed by ﬂ ow cytometry , showing > 95 % removal of surface - bound antibody . Uptake after binding on ice in immuno ﬂ uorescence . For co - uptake of Gal3 and anti - CD166 antibody in HeLa and MEF cells , the binding of ligands to the cell surface was performed sequentially on ice for 20 min each in serum - free medium , the ﬁ rst one being Gal3 ( Gal3 - A488 , 200nM ) and the second anti - CD166 anti - body . This operation avoids the nonspeci ﬁ c binding of Gal3 to the glycosylations of antibodies . After binding of each ligand , cells were extensively washed with ice - cold PBS + + . Endocytosis was triggered by switching cells back to 37°C with pre - warmed culture medium for 5 – 10min . Endocytosis was stopped on ice , and unbound ligands were removed by extensive washes with ice - cold PBS + + . Lactose stripping was then performed as explained above . Subsequent removal of signal coming from cell surface - accessible anti - CD166 antibody was performed differ - ently according to the cell line : acid stripping as above for HeLa , 45min of blocking on ice with 100 µgml − 1 unlabeled secondary antibodies for MEF . After extensive washes with ice - cold PBS + + , cells were ﬁ xed , permeabilized , incubated with ﬂ uorescent secondary antibody , and mounted as previously described ( see the “ Light microscopy ” section ) . Samples were imaged , and co - localization was quanti ﬁ ed as explained below . Uptake in live - cell imaging . Cells transiently or stably expressing endoA3 - GFP were maintained in serum - containing culture medium at 37°C under spinning - disk or TIRF microscope . Fluorescently labeled anti - CD166 antibody ( 5 µgml − 1 ) was added continuously in the culture medium , and cells were imaged for max - imum 2min up to 10 min after antibody addition . ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1457 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 15303 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Rescue of CD166 uptake by Gal8 . For this experiment , cells were previously transfected with AllStars Negative siRNA or siRNAs against endogenous Gal8 . Just before the experiment , cells were pre - incubated for 30min at 37°C in lactose buffer ( 20mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 150mM lactose , 45mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1mM CaCl 2 ) to strip off galectins present in the cellular environment . Cells were then incubated for 10min at 37°C in the continuous presence of anti - CD166 antibody ( 5µgml − 1 ) in pre - warmed serum - containing or serum - free medium , or serum - free medium supplemented with increasing doses of exogenous Gal8 ( 0 . 2 – 20nM ) . Endocytosis was stopped on ice , and unbound ligands were removed by extensive washes with ice - cold PBS + + . Residual cell surface - accessible galectins were stripped by three 5 - min washes on ice with lactose buffer ( see above ) . Residual cell surface - accessible anti - CD166 antibody was stripped by three 20 - s acid washes on ice ( see above ) . After neutralization by extensive washes with ice - cold PBS + + , cells were ﬁ xed , permeabilized , incubated with secondary antibody , and mounted for observation as previously described ( see the “ Light microscopy ” section ) . β 1 - adrenergic receptor uptake . β 1 - AR stimulation was performed by incubating BSC - 1 cells at 37°C for 4min with pre - warmed serum - free culture medium con - taining 10 µM dobutamine . After incubation , cells were quickly washed once at 37°C with pre - warmed PBS to remove unbound ligand , and ﬁ xed with pre - warmed 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20min at 37°C . Afterward , ﬁ xed cells were permeabilized and immunostained for β 1 - AR and endoA2 . For endoA3 detection , cells were transfected with an endoA3 - GFP construct 16 – 24h before the experi - ment . Resting conditions correspond to cells being cultured in 10 % serum medium and directly ﬁ xed . Of note , cells were never serum - starved or incubated at 4 °C before experiments . Pull - down assays . In all , 2 L cultures of BL21 Escherichia coli transformed with GST - CD166 tail and GST constructs ( see above ) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 100 µM IPTG for induction . After centrifugation , cell pellets were resus - pended in a solution of 150 mM NaCl , 25mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 2mM EDTA complemented with 1mM PMSF , 2 mM DTT , 100 µgml − 1 lysozyme , and protease inhibitor cocktail . After incubation on ice for 30 min , cells were lyzed by snap - freezing in liquid nitrogen , quick thawing , and brief sonication . Lysates were clari ﬁ ed by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor for 1 h at 41 , 000 rpm ( ~ 131 , 000 × g ) . Following centrifugation , the supernatant was bound to 1 - ml column bed of glutathione beads ( GE Healthcare ) . The beads were washed 5 times with 10 column volumes of wash buffer ( 500 mM NaCl , 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 2mM EDTA ) . Finally , protein - bound beads were resuspended in 1ml of lysis solution ( 150mM NaCl , 25mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 2mM EDTA ) . HeLa cells stably expressing GFP - FKBP - tagged endoA2 and endoA3 were quickly washed with ice - cold PBS , lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 25mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 2mM EDTA complemented with 1mM PMSF , 1 % NP40 , protease , and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( PhosSTOP roche ) ) , sonicated , and spun at 14 , 000 × g for 15min . In all , 100 µl of GST / GST - CD166 tail - bound beads were then exposed to cell lysates for 2h at 4 °C , pelleted in a cooled benchtop centrifuge , and washed ﬁ ve times in lysis buffer complemented with 1 % NP40 only . Beads were then boiled for 10min in 100 µl of sample buffer for elution , and 8µl of sample were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , ( “ input ” lanes correspond to 1 . 5 % of cell extract ( ﬁ nal concentration of ~ 0 . 04 mg ml − 1 ) ) . The proteins were transferred and immunoblotted using anti - endoA2 , anti - endoA3 , and anti - ezrin antibodies . Finally , membranes were stained with Coomassie blue to control the amount of GST fragments in each sample . STxB internalization and tubulation . Transport of STxB to perinuclear Golgi , or observation of plasma membrane STxB - induced tubules , were performed as pre - viously published 4 . For further details , see Supplementary Methods . Wound - healing assay . In total , 25 , 000 – 55 , 000 cells previously treated for 48 h with siRNAs were seeded in each compartment of wound - healing assay silicone inserts ( Ibidi , 80209 ) placed in the wells of a glass - bottom 24 - well SensoPlate dish ( Greiner , 662892 ) . Cells were grown for an additional 16 – 24 h to reach con ﬂ uency . Silicone inserts were removed , cells were washed with PBS , and fresh culture medium was added . Cell movements were followed for up to 48 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in bright - ﬁ eld illumination using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with an EC Plan - Neo ﬂ uar 10× numerical aperture ( NA ) 0 . 3 dry objective and a cabinet for control of temperature and CO 2 . Images were acquired every 10min at the same position for each sample , using time lapse and multiposition acquisition modules of Zen 2 . 3 sp1 blue edition software . Cell – cell adhesion ﬂ ipping assay . Cell – cell adhesion ﬂ ipping assays were per - formed as previously described 44 , 45 . Brie ﬂ y , a suspension of ﬂ uorescently labeled cells in PBS + + was sedimented for 10min in a chamber slide containing unlabeled con ﬂ uent monolayers of adherent cells . A picture was taken before ﬂ ipping the dish . Slides were then ﬁ lled and carefully dipped in a large vessel containing pre - warmed PBS + + . They were then rotated by 180° and maintained in an upside - down position for 15min , allowing cells that did not adhere to the monolayer to detach . The chamber slide was then rotated back 180° and carefully removed from the large vessel . A second picture was taken after ﬂ ipping , around the same position . Finally , the percentage of cells in suspension adhering to the monolayer of adherent cells was calculated . For this assay , wide - ﬁ eld images were rapidly acquired on a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 epi ﬂ uorescence microscope equipped with a EC Plan - Neo ﬂ uar 5× NA 0 . 16 dry objective and an ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 LT sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Image quanti ﬁ cations .
