PHASE SEPARATION Stoichiometry controls activity of phase - separated clusters of actin signaling proteins Lindsay B . Case 1 , 2 , Xu Zhang 2 , Jonathon A . Ditlev 1 , 2 , Michael K . Rosen 1 , 2 * Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane . Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) . LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2 / 3 complex . We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin – Nck – N - WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex , consequently increasing actin assembly . Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase - separated clusters , rendering N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 activity stoichiometry dependent . This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates . Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs . B iomolecular condensates are two - and three - dimensional compartments in eu - karyotic cells that concentrate specific collections of proteins and nucleic acids without an encapsulating membrane ( 1 , 2 ) . Many condensates behave as dynamic liquids and are believed to form through liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) driven by interactions between multivalent constituents ( 1 – 3 ) . Unlike macromolecular machines such as the ribo - some , which have discrete subunit stoichiome - tries and sizes , condensates can form with a wide range of component stoichiometries and range in size from hundreds to thousands of nanometers . Whereas the mechanisms that promote and regulate LLPS in vitro and in cells are increasingly well understood , the biochem - ical functions that arise from organization of macromolecules into these mesoscale assem - blies remain largely unknown . In particular , it is unknown whether condensates function pri - marily as concentrating devices or whether their physical properties also frequently alter specific activities of the collection of resident molecules ( analogous to specific activity in enzymology but applied here to the conden - sate as a whole ) . We have described two analogous signaling systemsthatformmembrane - associatedconden - sates in vitro and in cells ( 4 – 6 ) . These control actin assembly in podocyte cells of the kidney and in activated T cells , respectively . Both path - ways are initiated by transmembrane proteins — nephrin and linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) , respectively — whose disordered cytoplasmic tails are phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine resi - dues in response to upstream stimuli . These phosphoproteins then interact with collections of adapter proteins containing Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domains , SH3 domains , and proline - rich motifs ( PRMs ) . Multivalency in these mole - cules enables their assembly and concomitant phase separation , resulting in the formation of micrometer - scale signaling clusters on supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) in vitro and at the plasma membrane of cells . In both systems , clusters assemble actin fila - ments through the adapter protein Nck , its ligand N - WASP , and the actin nucleation factor , the Arp2 / 3 complex . In the LAT system , we previ - ously showed that LLPS increases the specific activity of molecules in the pathway toward activating the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 5 ) . However , withoutknowingthemechanismunderlyingthis increase , we could not determine whether this effect is specific to actin assembly or might be more general to other signaling systems . In this study , we sought to understand the mechanism by whichLLPScausesthisincreaseinactivity , how this mechanism could be exploited to regulate signaling output , and whether such effectsmight be observed in other signaling systems . Weattached fluorescently labeled His 8 - nephrin phosphorylatedonitsthreetyrosineresidues ( his - pNephrin ) at a density of ~ 1000 molecules / m m 2 on SLBs containing 2 % Ni - NTA ( nitrilotriacetic acid ) lipids . His - pNephrin alone is diffuse on SLBs , but upon addition of Nck and a constitu - tively active Alexa488 - labeled N - WASP ( hereafter referred to as N - WASP , fig . S1A ) , the proteins undergo LLPS to form micrometer - sized clusters ( fig . S1 , B to D ) . To initiate actin polymerization , weadded 1 m Mactin ( 5 % Alexa647labeled ) , 3nM Arp2 / 3complex , and6nMcappingprotein ( CapZ ) , the latter to focus the assay on actin nucleation rather than filament elongation ( figs . 1 , A and B , and S2A ) . This led to robust actin polymerization in the plane of the SLB , as observed by total in - ternal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( fig . S2 , A to C ) . We quantified actin polymeriza - tion inside and outside of the clusters by mea - suring Alexa647 - actin fluorescence intensity over time ( Fig . 1C ) . Inside clusters , actin fluorescence increased rapidly and plateaued within 2 min . Outside clusters , actin fluorescence increased more slowly . The actin assembly rate at half - maximal intensity ( red lines , Fig . 1C ) was about sixfold faster inside clusters than outside . To separate the effects of increased N - WASP con - centration within clusters from effects on spe - cific activity of the clusters , we divided the rates by the local N - WASP intensity ( Fig . 1D ) . This N - WASP – normalized actin assembly rate was about threefold faster inside clusters than out - side of clusters . Outside clusters , the normalized assembly rate was comparable to a negative con - trollacking the Arp2 / 3 complex . Whenthisback - ground is subtracted , the N - WASP – normalized actin assemblyrate inside theclusterswas ~ 14 - fold higher than outside . Thus , in addition to being at higher density , the specific activity of N - WASP is substantially increased inside phase - separated clusters , analogous to our previous observations with LAT signaling clusters ( 5 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is divalent and binds N - WASP with 1 : 2 stoichiometry ( 7 , 8 ) . This could lead to nonlinear recruitment and activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex with N - WASP density ( 9 ) . However , as detailed in fig . S3 , the amount of Alexa647 - labeled Arp2 / 3 complex recruited to theSLBscaled linearlywithhis - N - WASPdensity , and the N - WASP – normalized actin assembly rate was not density dependent . Thus , higher density is unlikely to account for the increased specific activity of clusters . Huang et al . have shown with single - molecule analysis that increased membrane dwell time in - duced by phase separation enhances activity in slow , multistep signaling cascades that are driven out of equilibrium by irreversible steps ( 10 , 11 ) . Actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex is a multistep process that initiates with binding of an Arp2 / 3 : WASP 2 : actin 2 assembly ( hereafter referred to as Arp2 / 3 assembly ) to an existing “ mother ” actin filament . A series of incompletely understoodconformationalchangesoftheArp2 / 3 complex and mother filament ( 12 , 13 ) then lead to dissociation of WASP proteins , irreversible attachment of Arp2 / 3 complex to the mother filament , and initiation of daughter - filament growth ( 14 ) . Single - molecule studies and kinetic modeling have shown that this process is slow , and WASP - bound intermediates have lifetimes in the 0 . 5 - to 10 - s range ( 14 – 16 ) . Because nucle - ation by the Arp2 / 3 complex is a slow , multistep process that involves at least one irreversible step , wehypothesizedthatmembranedwelltime might be a key parameter affecting N - WASP specific activity . To measure N - WASP membrane dwell time , we fused the photoactivatable fluorophore mEos2 to its N terminus and measured the fluorescence decrease over time after photoactivation ( which RESEARCH Case et al . , Science 363 , 1093 – 1097 ( 2019 ) 8 March 2019 1 of 5 1 The HHMI Summer Institute , Marine Biological Laboratory , Woods Hole , MA 02543 , USA . 2 Department of Biophysics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX 75390 , USA . * Corresponding author .

We found that N - WASP membrane dwell time increased from 18 s outside clusters to 30 s inside clusters ( Fig . 1E ) . Thus , LLPS increases the membrane dwell time of N - WASP in nephrin clusters . We used several different approaches to ex - perimentally perturb dwell time and examined the corresponding effects on activity . First , we quantitativelycompared his - N - WASP attacheddi - rectly to SLBs to an identical density of N - WASP attached indirectly to the bilayer through his - Nck ( Fig . 2A ) . The average dwell time of the former is > 2 hours ( fig . S5 ) , whereas that of the latter is < 20 s ( Fig . 2B ) . The N - WASP – normalized actin assembly rate of stably attached his - N - WASP wasmorethan40 timesthatofhis - Nck + N - WASP ( Fig . 2C ) . Membrane dwell time can also be in - creasedbyincreasingthelocaldensityofbindingsites , likely through a combination of decreased rate of dissociation from binding partners and more rapid membrane rebinding after initial dissociation ( 17 ) . We engineered his - Nck analogs with either three repeats [ his - Nck ( SH3 ) 3 ] or six repeats [ his - Nck ( SH3 ) 6 ] of the second SH3 do - main ( fig . S6A ) . To prevent phase separation of his - Nck ( SH3 ) 6 , we added 300 mM NaCl to the buffer ( fig . S6B ) . Doubling the local density of SH3 domains increased N - WASP membrane dwell time from 7 . 9 to 9 . 5 s ( fig . S6C ) and in - creased the N - WASP – normalized actin assembly rate 2 . 2 - fold ( fig . S6D ) . Finally , we clustered his - Nck ( SH3 ) 6 with pNephrin ( Fig . 2D ) , increasing N - WASP membrane dwell time from 9 . 5 to 12 . 1 s ( Fig . 2E ) and the N - WASP – normalized actin as - sembly rate threefold ( Fig . 2F ) . Thus , increasing N - WASP membrane dwell time through three independent molecular mechanisms consistently increased the N - WASP – normalized actin assem - bly rate . Next , we sought to systematically alter the membrane dwell time of N - WASP within clus - ters . Wereasoned thatdwelltimeislikelyrelated to the number of SH3 - PRM interactions that connect each N - WASP to Nck molecules that are also bound to pNephrin ( “ N - WASP connect - ivity ” ) . This connectivity should , in turn , be dictated by the relative stoichiometry of his - pNephrin , Nck , and N - WASP . To test this idea initially , we used SpringSaLaD ( 18 ) to simulate pNephrin – Nck – N - WASP clustering on membranes ( fig . S7 , A to D ) . We found that N - WASP con - nectivity shows a nonmonotonic dependence on Nck concentration when pNephrin density and N - WASP concentration are held constant ( Fig . 3A ) . At low concentrations most Nck is bound to pNephrin , and increasing the concentration of Nck increases multivalent SH3 interactions with the PRM elements of N - WASP , thus increasing N - WASP connectivity . However , once the number ofNckmolecules exceeds the number of Nephrin pTyr sites , further increases in Nck decrease con - nectivity because N - WASP molecules become de - corated with Nck molecules that are not bound to pNephrin ( Fig . 3B and fig . S8 ) . To test this model experimentally , we varied stoichiometry in nephrin clusters by keeping the membrane density of his - pNephrin con - stant ( ~ 1000 molecules / m m 2 ) , and varying the concentrations of N - WASP and Nck in solution ( fig . S9 , A to C ) . For three N - WASP conditions ( 100 nM N - WASP , 250 nM N - WASP , and main - taining a constant 1 : 2 N - WASP : Nck ratio ) , we varied Nck concentration from 100 nM to 2 m M . In all titrations , the membrane dwell time of N - WASP showed a similar nonmonotonic rela - tionship with Nck concentration , with a maxi - mum at 200 to 500 nM Nck ( Fig . 3C ) . Because the Arp2 / 3 complex is the proximal nucleator of actin filaments , we also examined itsmembranedwelltimeundertheseconditions . Using a mask generated from the image of N - WASP ( Fig . 3D ) , we tracked single Alexa647 - Arp2 / 3 complex particles inside and outside of clusters . Particles that remained on the mem - brane for at least 3 s were classified as long - lived . Outside clusters , only 6 % of particles were long - lived ( Fig . 3E ) , whereas inside clusters , 21 % were long - lived ( Fig . 3E ) . Photobleaching occurred at a much slower rate than particle dissociation from the membrane and does not apprecia - bly affect these values ( k dissoc , outside = 1 . 67 s − 1 , k dissoc , inside = 0 . 35s − 1 , k bleach = 0 . 023 s − 1 , fig . S10A ) . In titration experiments , the percent - age of long - lived Arp2 / 3 complexes had the same Case et al . , Science 363 , 1093 – 1097 ( 2019 ) 8 March 2019 2 of 5 Inside Outside 0 10 20 30 40 50 N - W A S P D w e ll T i m e ( s ) 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 N - W A SP - N o r m a li z e d A c t i n A s se m b l y R a t e ( p e r s ) 0 100 200 300 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Time ( s ) A c t i n i n t e n s i t y ( a . u . ) A c t i n N - W ASP 0 s 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s Inside clusters Outside clusters A B C D Inside Outside Inside Outside 1 µM Actin 3 nM Arp2 / 3 6 nM CapZ 1 µM Actin 0 nM Arp2 / 3 6 nM CapZ ns p < 0 . 0001 O v e r l a y p < 0 . 0001 p p p p p p p p p p p p Arp2 / 3 Complex Actin Filaments N - WASP p - Nephrin Nck Actin Monomers CapZ + E Fig . 1 .

RESEARCH | REPORT nonmonotonic dependence on Nck concentra - tion ( Fig . 3F ) and positively correlated with the N - WASP dwell time ( Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 63 , p < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3G ) . This correlation suggests that within clusters , the Arp2 / 3 complex often dis - sociates from the membrane in complex with N - WASP . By contrast , the percentage of long - lived Arp2 / 3 complexes outside clusters is insen - sitive to stoichiometry and does not exceed 7 % ( fig . S10B ) . To test whether stoichiometric control of dwell time regulates the rate of actin assembly , we performed actin assembly assays across the same nephrin – Nck – N - WASP stoichiometries as in Fig . 3 , C and F . The N - WASP – normalized actin assem - bly rate was nonmonotonic with Nck concentra - tion ( Fig . 4A ) and strongly correlated with N - WASP membrane dwell time among all the data ( Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 85 , p < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 4B ) . This normalized rate did not positively correlate with N - WASP density ( fig . S12A ) . It showed only a weak correlation with N - WASP density divided by N - WASP solution concentration ( fig . S12C ) , a parameter that would be expected to correlate with binding affinity of N - WASP for the clusters , suggestingthatdissociationrateratherthanbind - ing affinity governs the actin assembly rate . A sim - ilar correlation with N - WASP dwell time , but not density or binding affinity , was found when actin assembly rates were normalized to the density of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4C , Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 82 , p < 0 . 0002 ; figs . S11 and S12 , B and D ) , sug - gesting that the long - lived N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 as - semblies are the active species at clusters . In cellular experiments , we observed a similar non - monotonic dependence of both N - WASP dwell time ( Fig . 3 , H to J ) and N - WASP – normalized actin assembly ( Fig . 4 , D to F , and fig . S13 ) on the density of Nck at nephrin clusters on the plasma membrane , and N - WASP dwell time pos - itively correlated with actin assembly ( Fig . 4G , Pearson ’ s r = 0 . 73 , p < 0 . 02 ) . Thus , relative stoi - chiometry is sufficient to regulate specific activ - ity of clusters containing full - length N - WASP in the complex cellular environment . Because the progression from the initial assembly of Arp2 / 3 : WASP 2 : actin 2 plus mother filament to the com - mencement of daughter - filament growth is not understood mechanistically , we are not able to develop a rigorous kinetic model to explain our data . Nevertheless , the data clearly show that stoichiometry controls specific activity in phase - separated nephrin clusters . We have shown in this study that phase sepa - ration of pNephrin , Nck , and N - WASP on SLBs increases the specific activity of clusters by in - creasing the membrane dwell time of N - WASP and its assemblies with the Arp2 / 3 complex , consequently increasing Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly . Additionally , because the relative stoi - chiometry of the components dictates dwell time , the activity of the pathway is controlled by stoi - chiometry . These observations suggest that phase separation may enable a binary switch between low - activity and high - activity states of this path - way and that variations in stoichiometry may enable fine - tuning of the response within the high - activity regime . Together , phase separa - tion and stoichiometric control could help sup - press noise in low - activity states but still allow modulation after a commitment to action has been made . These mechanisms may contribute to the observed Nck density dependence of actin polymerization in cells ( 19 ) and could regulate diverse actin signaling pathways that use phase separation at membranes ( 5 , 20 , 21 ) . Because the multivalent SH2 - pTyr and SH3 - PRM inter - actions that promote LLPS in this system , as wellastheslow , multistep , nonequilibriumdown - stream process , are found in numerous signaling pathways , these behaviors should be generaliz - able . Consistent with this idea , the LAT - Grb2 - SOS pathway also phase separates and shows dwell time – dependent activation of Ras ( 11 ) . Stoichiometry - dependent control of specific ac - tivity is distinct from canonical mechanisms of allostery and colocalization . This mechanism re - quires biomolecular assemblies ( not necessarily phase - separated ) that can form across a range of component stoichiometries , unlike molecu - lar machines . Our data support the idea that material and physical properties , determined by the dynamic behaviors of component mol - ecules , may be generally important in defining the biochemical activities of biomolecular con - densates ( 1 , 2 ) .
