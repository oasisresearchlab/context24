Glycolipid - anchored Proteins in Neuroblastoma Cells Form Detergent - resistant Complexes without Caveolin Alexander Gorodinsky and David A . Harris Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , Missouri 63110 Abstract . It has been known for a number of years that glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored pro - teins , in contrast to many transmembrane proteins , are insoluble at 4°C in nonionic detergents such as Triton X - 100 . Recently , it has been proposed that this be - havior reflects the incorporation of GPI - linked proteins into large aggregates that are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol , as well as in cytoplasmic signaling mole - cules such as heterotrimeric G proteins and src - family tyrosine kinases . It has been suggested that these lipid - protein complexes are derived from caveolae , non - clathrin - coated invaginations of the plasmalemma that are abundant in endothelial cells , smooth muscle , and lung . Caveolin , a proposed coat protein of caveo - lae , has been hypothesized to be essential for forma - tion of the complexes . To further investigate the rela - tionship between the detergent - resistant complexes and caveolae , we have characterized the behavior of GPI - anchored proteins in lysates of N2a neuroblastoma cells , which lack morphologically identifiable caveo - lae , and which do not express caveolin ( Shyng , S . - L . , J . E . Heuser , and D . A . Harris . 1994 . J . Cell Biol . 125 : 1239 - 1250 ) . We report here that the complexes prepared from N2a cells display the large size and low buoyant density characteristic of complexes isolated from sources that are rich in caveolae , and contain the same major constituents , including multiple GPI - anchored proteins , ot and fl subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins , and the tyrosine kinases fyn and yes . Our results argue strongly that detergent - resistant com - plexes are not equivalent to caveolae in all cell types , and that in neuronal cells caveolin is not essential for the integrity of these complexes . diverse group of proteins is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) a anchor ( reviewed by Cross , 1990 ; Englund , 1993 ) . This group includes lymphocyte and trypanosome surface antigens , adhesion molecules , exofacial enzymes , and recep - tors . The core structure of the anchor consists of a phospho - ethanolamine residue amide - linked to the COOH - terminal amino acid of the protein , three mannose residues , an un - acetylated glucosamine residue , and a phosphatidylinositol molecule that is embedded in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer . This core is transferred en bloc to the polypeptide chain in the endoplasmic reticulum , following cleavage of a hydrophobic COOH - terminal domain that serves as a signal for anchor addition .

It has been known for a number of years that glycolipid - anchored proteins , in contrast to many transmembrane pro - teins , are relatively insoluble in nonionic detergents at 4°C ( Vitetta et al . , 1973 ; Letarte - Muirhead et al . , 1974 ; Low , 1989 ) . Recently , it has been proposed that this phenomenon results from incorporation of GPI - linked proteins into large complexes that contain sphingolipids and cholesterol , as well as cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as src - family tyrosine kinases and GTP - binding proteins ( Stefanova et al . , 1991 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Zur - zolo et al . , 1994 ; Shenoy - Scaria et al . , 1994 ) . Although de - scribed in detergent extracts , these complexes are presumed to represent microdomains of the plasma membrane that ex - ist in intact cells . The proposed functions of these domains include protein sorting in polarized cells ( Simons and Wadinger - Ness , 1990 ) and transmembrane signaling in lym - phocytes ( Robinson , 1991 ; Brown , 1993 ) . Several recent studies have suggested that the detergent - resistant domains represent caveolae , which are non - clathrin - coated invaginations of the plasmalemma that have been de - scribed in some cell types , including epithelial cells , smooth muscle cells , and fibroblasts ( Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994a , b ) . The basis for identifying the complexes with caveolae is , first , the observa - tion that several GPI - anchored proteins that are enriched in © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 05 / 619 / 9 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , Number 3 , May 1995 619 - 627 619 the complexes are clustered in caveolae after antibody label - ing for electron microscopy ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Ying et al . , 1992 ; Mayor et al . , 1994 ) ; caveolae may mediate endo - cytic uptake of some of these proteins ( Parton et al . , 1994 ) . Second , electron microscopic examination of the isolated complexes reveals membranous vesicles , some of which are said to have the dimensions and appearance of caveolae ( Chang et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994a ) . Third , the com - plexes are enriched in caveolin , a 21 - kD phosphoprotein that is thought to form part of the cytoplasmic coat of caveolae ( Lisanti et al . , 1993 ) ; cells that do not express caveolin ap - pear to yield " incomplete " complexes ( Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Zurzolo et al . , 1994 ) . Despite these correlations , how - ever , the precise relationship between caveolae and the deter - gent - resistant complexes remains uncertain . We have been studying the cell biological properties of a cellular isoform of the prion protein ( prpc ) , a glycolipid - anchored surface protein that is expressed predominantly in neurons and gila in the CNS , and that is critically involved in the pathogenesis of an unusual group of transmissible neu - rodegenerative diseases called spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases ( reviewed by Prusiner and DeArmond , 1994 ) . We found previously that chicken prion protein ( chPrP ) , the chicken homologue of mammalian PrP c , is en - docytosed via clathrin - coated pits in neuroblastoma cells , as well as in embryonic neurons and glia ( Shyng et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . Caveolae do not seem to be involved in internalization of chPrP in neuroblastoma cells , since we observed that these cells do not contain morphologically identifiable cav - eolae by thin - section or deep - etch electron microscopy , and since they do not express caveolin protein or mRNA ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . To help clarify the relationship between detergent - resis - tant complexes and caveolae , we have analyzed the proper - ties of GPI - anchored proteins in lysates of neuroblastoma cells that lack caveolae . We report here that the detergent - resistant complexes isolated from these cells have all the ma - jor constituents of the complexes prepared from sources that are rich in caveolae and caveolin , such as epithelial cells , lung , and smooth muscle . The complexes are enriched in chPrP and other GPI - anchored proteins , as well as in several tyrosine kinases and a and / 3 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins . Our results demonstrate , first , that caveolin is not essential for the formation of these complexes . Second , they indicate that detergent - resistant complexes are not equiva - lent to caveolae in all cell types , and suggest that in neuronal cells additional molecular components might be required for the formation of caveolae . Finally , the association of chPrP with kinases and G proteins raises the possibility that PrP c and other GPI - anchored proteins might be involved in signal transduction processes in neuronal cells . The work presented here has been reported in abstract form ( Gorodinsky , A . , G . E Wu , and D . A . Harris . 1994 . GPI - anchored proteins in neuronal cells form detergent - resis - tant complexes without caveolin . Mol . Biol . Cell . 5 : 320a ) . Materials and Methods Antibodies and Reagents A rabbit antiserum raised against a bacterial fusion protein encompassing amino acids 35 - 96 of chPrP has been described previously ( Harris et al . , 1993 ) . A mouse monocional antibody ( IH4 ) raised against human decay - accelerating factor ( DAF ) ( Coyne et al . , 1992 ) was a gift from Dr . D . M . Lublin ( Washington University , St . Louis , MO ) . Rabbit antisera against ct and / ~ subunits of G proteins ( P - 960 lCasey et al . , 19901 and U - 49 Mumby et al . , 1986 , respectively ) were kindly provided by Dr . M . Linder ( Wash - ington University ) . A mouse monoclonal antibody ( TD . I ) against clathrin heavy chain was a gift of Dr . E Brodsky ( University of California , San Francisco ) . A rabbit antiserum against p62 ~ s was a gift of Dr . M . Sudol ( Rockefeller University , NY ) , and a mouse monoclonal antibody against p59 ~ was purchased from Transduction Laboratories . An anti - phospho - tyrosine monoclonal antibody ( 4G10 ) was from Upstate Biotechnology , Inc . ( Lake Placid , NY ) . Cell culture reagents were from the Tissue Culture Support Center at Washington University . Biotin - X - NHS was obtained from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) , 32P - ' y - ATP from Amersham Corp . ( Arlington Heights , ILL and all other reagents from Sigma Immunochemieals ( St . Louis , MO ) . Phosphatidylinositol - specific pbospholipase C ( PIPLC ) was prepared by the procedure of Low ( 1992 ) from supernatants from cultures of Bacillus subtilis carrying a plasmid encoding PIPLC from Bacillus thuringiensis . Cell Lines N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells ( CCLI31 , American Type Culture Collec - tion , Rockville , MD ) were grown in MEM containing 10 % FCS , nonessen - tial amino acids , and penicillin / streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5 % COz / 95 % air . The transfected line of N2a cells expressing wild - type chPrP is the clone designated A26 that we have described previously ( Harris et at . , 1993 ) . To prepare the DAF - expressing line , N2a cells were transfected with Lipo - fectin ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) using a 1 : 10 mixture of pRSVneo ( Ulrich and Ley , 1990 ) and a pBCI2 / CMV expression plasmid ( Cullen , 1986 ) containing a human DAF cDNA ( Lublin and Atkinson , 1989 ) . Anti - biotic - resistant clones were selected in 700 # g / ml geneticin ( G418 ) , ex - panded , and then maintained in 300 / ~ g / rnl geneticin . The chPrP transmembrane chimera consists of amino acids 1 - 241 of chPrP fused to amino acids 2310 - 2364 of a mutant version of the bovine cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor . A plasmid encoding this mutant ( 346 ) , which is impaired in its ability to undergo coated pit - mediated internalization ( Jadot et al . , 1992 ) , was kindly provided by Dr . S . Kornfeld ( Washington University ) . A cDNA encoding the chimeric pro - tein was constructed by recombinant PCR ( Hignchi , 1989 ) using Vent poly - merase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) , and cloned into the pBC12 / CMV expression vector . Transfection was carried out as described above . Preparation of Detergent Lysates Cells grown to confluence in 100 - mm dishes were solubilized at 4°C in a lysis buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 20 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM PMSE 1 i ~ g / ml pepstatin , and 1 # g / ml leupeptin . This buffer is similar to ones used by Brown and Rose ( 1992 ) and Sargiacomo et al . ( 1993 ) ; in agreement with the latter authors , we find that extraction at pH 6 . 5 produces a higher yield of detergent - resistant complexes than ex - traction at pH 7 . 5 . Gel Filtration of Triton - insoluble Complexes A modification of the procedure of Cinek and Horejsi ( 1992 ) was used . De - tergent lysates prepared as above were cleared by centrifugation ( 16 , 000 g , 10 min at 4°C ) , and 250 / ~ 1 was applied to a 0 . 7 x 9 - cm column of Sepharose 4B . The column was eluted at 4°C with lysis buffer , and 15 0 . 3 - ml fractions were collected . Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with cold metha - nol and analyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting . The column was calibrated using intact and lysed erythrocytes as described by Shenoy - Scaria et al . ( 1994 ) . Intact erythrocytes eluted in fractions 6 and 7 ( the void volume of the column ) , while hemoglobin from the lysed erythrocytes eluted in fractions 10 - 14 . Isopycnic Centrifugation of Triton - insoluble Complexes We employed either a continuous sucrose gradient , as described by Brown and Rose ( 1992 ) and Sargiacomo et al . ( 1993 ) , or a step - gradient . For the continuous gradient , uncleared detergent lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 80 % sucrose in lysis buffer without Triton , and then overlaid with The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 620 a linear 5 - 30 % gradient of sucrose in lysis buffer without Triton . After 16 - 20 h of centrifugation in an SW - 41 rotor ( 170 , 000 g ) fractions were col - lected from the bottom of the tube using a no . 20 stainless steel syringe nee - dle . Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with methanol and analyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting . For the step gradient , uncleared detergent lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 80 % in lysis buffer without Triton , and then overlaid with steps of 22 and 5 % sucrose in the same buffer . Low - density complexes were collected from the 22 % / 5 % sucrose interface using a syringe , diluted , and collected by centrifugation . Detection of Surface - biotinylated , GPI - anchored Proteins Cells were treated with biotin - X - NHS for 15 rain at 4°C , and the reaction was then quenched with 50 mM glycine in TBS . Cells were lysed , and low - density complexes collected by fractionation on a sucrose step - gradient as described above . Complexes were resuspended in TBS containing 1 % Tri - ton X - 114 plus protease inhibitors . ( Triton X - 114 was diluted from a 12 % stock solution that was precondensed according to Bordier 1981 ) . After incubation at 37 " C for 20 rain , aqueous and detergent phases were separated by centrifugation . The detergent phase was diluted to the initial volume with TBS , and then incubated with PIPLC for 2 h at 4°C , and the phase separa - tion repeated . Proteins in each phase were precipitated with cold methanol , separated by SDS - PAGE , and blotted . Blots were developed using HRP - conjugated streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) ( Amer - sham Corp . ) . In Vitro Kinase Reactions Triton - insoluble complexes were isolated on a continuous sucrose density gradient as described above , and were resuspended in kinase buffer contain - ing 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 5 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM MnCI2 , and 0 . 1 mM Na ~ VO4 . For the detection of total kinase activity , 10 ~ tCi of 32Pl ~ - ATP was added to 20 - / ~ 1 reactions , and incubation was carried out for 15 min at 250C . Proteins were then analyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by autoradi - ography . For the detection of tyrosine kinase activity , samples were incubated as above , except that 0 . 5 mM of unlabeled ATP was used . Proteins were then analyzed by SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti - phos - photyrosine antibody . The Triton - insoluble complexes used for these ex - periments were prepared in the presence of Na3VO4 to inhibit phosphatases . Immunoblotting Immunoblots on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) were developed using HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using ECL . Film images were digitized using an HP Scardet IIp scanner , and band intensities quantitated using SigmaScan / Image ( Jan - del Scientific , Corte Madera , CA ) . Short exposure times were used to main - rain linearity . To measure the total amount of protein in column or gradient fractions , blots were stained with Coomassie Blue , and the stain intensity in the corresponding lane measured from a scanned image of the blot . The concentration of specific immunoreactive proteins was calculated by divid - ing the digitized signal from the ECL film by the digitized signal from the Coomassie - stained blot . Electron Microscopy Triton - insoluble complexes isolated on a continuous sucrose density gra - dient were pelleted ( 150 , 000 g , 30 rain ) and fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M Na cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h on ice . Samples were then postfixed in 1 . 25 % OsO4 in cacodylate buffer , incubated with 4 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol , infiltrated with propy - lene oxide and embedded in PolyBed 812 ( Polysciences Inc . , Warrington , PA ) . Samples were then sectioned , post - stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined using an electron microscope ( 10A ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) . Results We have previously shown that N2a neuroblastoma cells do not contain morphologically identifiable caveolae , as demonstrated by both thin - section and deep - etch electron microscopy , nor do they express caveolin mRNA or protein ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . In view of reports that caveolae can be isolated as detergent - resistant complexes containing multi - ple GPI - anchored proteins , it was of interest to characterize the biochemical properties of GPI - anchored proteins in ly - sates of N2a cells . In particular , our aim was to determine whether the complexes recovered from N2a cells were simi - lar in composition and physical properties to those prepared from cell types that are rich in caveolae , such as epithelial and smooth muscle cells . As model GPI - anchored proteins for our studies , we have used chPrP , the chicken homologue of mammalian PrP c ( Harris et al . , 1991 ) , and human DAF ( Lublin and Atkinson , 1989 ) . Both proteins were expressed by stable transfection of N2a cells , and recognized using specific antibodies . ChPrP and DAF Expressed in N2a Cells Are Insoluble in Triton X - IO0 We first undertook to analyze the solubility of chPrP and DAF in 1 % Triton X - 100 at 4°C , conditions under which GPI - anchored proteins in many cell types are insoluble . De - tergent lysates of N2a cells expressing each protein were cen - trifuged at 150 , 000 g , and the amount of chPrP or DAF in the supernatants and pellets determined by immunoblotting ( Fig . 1 ) . Both proteins were found to be almost completely insoluble in this assay , suggesting that in the presence of de - tergent they remained associated with molecular aggregates that were sufficiently large to pellet in an ultracentrifuge . ChPrP and DAF Are Incorporated into Large Molecular Complexes with a Low Buoyant Density To obtain information about the size of the detergent - resis - tant aggregates , we subjected lysates of N2a cells to chroma - tography on Sepharose 4B , as has been done for other cell types ( Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 , both chPrP and DAF eluted in the void volume of the column , in - dicating these proteins were present in complexes that had a molecular mass greater than 2 x 107 D . Previous studies have shown that complexes containing GPI - anchored proteins float at a low buoyant density after centrifugation in sucrose gradients , presumably because of their high content of sphingolipids and cholesterol ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . We therefore subjected detergent lysates of N2a cells to equilibrium centrifugation in 5 - 30 % linear su - crose gradients , and assayed fractions for chPrP and DAF by immunoblotting ( Fig . 3 ) . Both proteins were recovered pre - dominantly in fractions 5 - 7 , which contained between 15 and 20 % sucrose ( Fig . 3 D ) , and had a density of 1 . 06 - 1 . 08 g / cc . Significantly , this region of the gradient contained less than 2 % of the total cellular protein , most of which was found in denser fractions near the bottom of the tube ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) ; these fractions presumably contained most of the soluble proteins in the cell . This result indicates that chPrP and DAF are enriched ~ 50 - fold in the detergent - resistant complexes . To test whether the GPI anchor was responsible for re - cruitment into the complexes , we constructed a transmem - brane version of chPrP in which a portion of the COOH ter - minus of the protein containing the signal for GPI addition was replaced with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic do - mains of the cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate re - Gorodinsky and Harris GPl - anchored Proteins in Neuroblastoma Cells 621 Figure 1 . ChPrP and DAF are insoluble in Triton X - 100 when expressed in N2a ceils . Triton X - 100 lysates of N2a cells expressing each protein were prepared at 4°C , and centrifuged at 150 , 000 g for 30 min at the same tempera - ture . Molecular mass markers are given in kD .

Both proteins elute in the void volume of the Sepharose column , which is indicated by the arrow labeled Vo . The included volume of the column encompasses fractions 10 - 14 ( see Materials and Methods ) . ceptor . We confirmed by surface iodination that this chi - meric protein was expressed on the plasma membrane of transfected N2a cells , and that it was not GPI - anchored be - cause it was not released by digestion with bacterial PIPLC ( data not shown ) . We found that the transmembrane form of chPrP , in contrast to the GPI - anehored version , fractionated near the bottom of the sucrose gradient ( Fig . 3 ) , indicating that the GPI anchor is essential for incorporation of the pro - tein into low - density complexes . Triton - resistant Complexes Contain Other GPI - anchored Surface Proteins To determine whether endogenous GPI - anchored proteins are present in complexes from N2a cells , we surface bi - otinylated untransfected cells , and subjected detergent ex - tracts to centrifugation on sucrose gradients as described above . Proteins in the region of the gradient between 15 and 20 % sucrose were then phase separated in Triton X - 114 be - fore and after digestion with PIPLC ( Fig . 4 A ) . A number of biotinylated proteins are present in the detergent phase in the absence of PIPLC treatment ( lane 2 ) , consistent with the idea that the low - density complexes contain a variety of inte - gral membrane proteins that are exposed on the cell surface . Most of these proteins are shifted into the aqueous phase by treatment with PIPLC ( lane 5 ) , suggesting that they contain a GPI anchor . The same set of PIPLC - releasable proteins is seen when chPrP - expressing N2a cells are analyzed , but in addition a prominent 40 - 50 - kD band is observed ( Fig . 4 B , lane 5 ) ; immunoprecipitation of this band confirms that it is chPrP ( not shown ) , demonstrating that chPrP molecules on the cell surface are incorporated into detergent - resistant complexes . Triton - resistant Complexes Contain Heterotrimeric G Proteins and Non - receptor Tyrosine Kinases Several GTP - binding proteins and src - family tyrosine kinases have been reported to be associated with GPI - anchored pro - teins in detergent extracts from MDCK cells , smooth mus - cle , and lung ( Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Arreaza et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994a ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) . We used specific antibodies to identify these signaling molecules in detergent lysates of N2a cells after centrifugation on sucrose density gradients ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . To recognize heterotrimeric G proteins , we used a rabbit polyclonal antibody P - 960 , which has highest affinity for ot ~ and C ~ o , but also recognizes as , ctz , and or , ( Casey et al . , 1990 ) ; and U - 49 , which is spe - cific for the / ~ t subunit ( Mumby et al . , 1986 ) . Western blot analysis revealed a distinct peak of G ~ immunoreactivity along the sucrose gradient , in the same region as the Triton - insoluble complexes containing chPrP and DAF ( fractions 5 - 7 ) . fl subunit immunoreactivity was distributed more uni - formly across the gradient , but when correction was made for the amount of protein in each fraction , the / 3 subunit was highly enriched in fractions 5 and 6 . Thus , both t ~ and / 3 sub - units of heterotrimeric G proteins were enriched in low - density complexes from N2a cells . Immunoblotting of gradient fractions with antibodies to two different src - family tyrosine kinases , fyn and yes , also showed peaks of immunoreactivity in the low - density region of the gradient ( fractions 6 and 7 ) ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . To test whether kinases in these fractions were catalytically active , The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 622 B 1 2 3 4 S 6 7 I ! 9 10 11 Fraction number D = = chPrP , GPl - anchored . e m - - 0 - chPrP , b ' an , , mmbrarm = - - O - - DAF ~ - 100 80 60 40 20 0 ~ protein , , , , , , , J , , , 1 2 3 4 5 $ 7 8 9 10 11 Fraction number 35 30 u 10 5 Figure 3 . GPI - anchored forms of chPrP and DAF , but not a transmembrane form of chPrP , are present in low - density complexes after detergent extraction . N2a cells expressing either GPI - anchored chPrP , transmembrane ch _ PrP ( chirp residues 1 - 241 fused to the transmem - brane and cytoplasmic domains of the cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ) , or DAF were homogenized at 4°C in a buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 . The homogenate was brought to 40 % sucrose , overlaid with a continuous gradient of 30 % to 5 % sucrose , and centrifuged to equilibrium ( 170 , 000 g for 16 h ) . Gradient fractions were immunoblotted to detect the expressed proteins ( A and B ) , and the blot stained with Coomassie to reveal the total amount of protein in each fraction ( C ) . The triangles in D show a plot of the total protein in each fraction derived by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie stained blot , and the diamonds show a plot of the sucrose concentration in each fraction . Note that the two GPI - anchored proteins float at 15 - 20 % sucrose ( fractions 5 - 7 ) , while the transmembrane form of chPrP is found near the bottom of the gradient ( fractions 1 - 4 ) with the bulk of the cellular protein . we carried out in vitro kinase assays using [ 32P ] - 7 - ATP . We found that multiple proteins were phosphorylated , ranging in molecular mass from 40 to over 140 kD ( Fig . 6 ( 7 , lane 2 ) . Several proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine resi - dues after incubation with unlabeled ATP , as shown by reac - tivity with anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies ( Fig . 6 C , lane 4 ) . The prominent group of tyrosine - phosphorylated bands near 60 kD may represent phosphorylated forms of fyn , yes , or other src - family kinases . Of note , we have not observed any phosphorylated bands corresponding in size to caveolin ( Mr = , , 020 kD ) , in agreement with our previous report that caveolin protein and mRNA are absent in N2a cells ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . Triton - resistant Complexes Are Membranous Vesicles That Do Not Contain Clathrin Examination of isolated Triton - resistant complexes by thin - section electron microscopy revealed a heterogeneous col - lection of vesicles having diameters of 200 - 800 nm ( Fig . 7 ) . We did not observe any structures resembling either caveolae or clathrin - coated vesicles . Since we have recently shown that chPrP is endocytosed via clathrin - coated pits in N2a cells ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) , we were interested in determining where coated vesicles migrated in the sucrose density gradient under conditions used for isolation of detergent - resistant complexes . Immuno - blotting of the gradient fractions with an antibody against the heavy chain of clathrin showed that this protein was localized primarily in the high - density fractions 1 - 4 ( Fig . 8 ) , with some recovered in the pellet that collects at the bottom of the tube ( not shown ) . No clathrin heavy chain was detected in the low - density area of the gradient where GPI - anchored proteins were recovered . This distribution of clathrin is in accord with the reported resistance of clathrin - coated vesi - cles to Triton X - 100 treatment , and with their high buoyant density , which is approximately equal to that of 52 % sucrose ( Woodward and Roth , 1978 ) . Discussion It has been known for many years that , in contrast to many transmembrane proteins , GPI - anchored proteins from a va - Gorodinsky and Harris GPl - anchored Proteins in Neuroblastoma Cells 623 Figure 4 . Triton - resistant com - plexes from N2a ceils contain multiple GPI - anchored sur - face proteins . Untransfected N2a cells ( A ) or N2a cells expressing chPrP ( B ) were surface - biotinylated , lysed in Triton X - 100 at 4 " C , and the lysates fractionated on a su - crose step - gradient ( see Mate - rials and Methods ) . Com - plexes that collected at the 5 % / 22 % sucrose interface were resuspended in 1 % Tri - ton X - 114 , and phase separation induced by warming to 37°C . The aqueous phase ( lane 1 ) was saved , and the diluted detergent phase was incubated at 4°C with ( lanes 4 and 5 ) or without ( lanes 2 and 3 ) PIPLC . The phase separation was then repeated to yield a sec - ond set of detergent phases ( lanes 2 and 4 ) and aqueous phases ( lanes 3 and 5 ) . The proteins in each phase were methanol - precipi - tated , separated by SDS - PAGE using a Bio - Rad mini - gel apparatus , and blotted . Blots were then developed with HRP - streptavidin using ECL . Multiple biotinylated , integral membrane proteins are pres - ent in low - density complexes from both cell lines , and most of these are releasable by PIPLC ( lane 5 ) . The bracket in B indicates a pro - tein that is absent in untransfected N2a cells ( A ) , and that can be shown by immunoprecipitation to be chPrP . riety of cell types are relatively insoluble at 4°C in non - ionic detergents such as Triton X - 100 ( Vitetta et al . , 1973 ; Letarte - Muirhead et al . , 1974 ; Low , 1989 ) . Presumably , this results from their incorporation into molecular aggre - gates or complexes that are resistant to disruption by the detergent . Recently , the composition and possible functions of these complexes have been subjects of intensive study . Detergent - resistant complexes from several sources have been characterized , including those from a kidney epithelial cell line ( MDCK ) ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1993 ; Zurzolo et al . , 1994 ) , lym - phoid cell lines ( Stefanova et al . , 1991 ; Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Bohuslav et al . , 1993 ) , HeLa cells ( Shenoy - Scaria et al . , 1994 ; Rodgers et al . , 1994 ) , lung ( Lisanti et al . , 1994a ) , and gizzard ( Chang et al . , 1994 ) . The complexes from all of these sources contain multiple GPI - anchored proteins . They also contain several kinds of cytoplasmic signaling molecules , including src - family tyrosine kinases , o ~ and / ~ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins , and small GTP - bind - ing proteins . Direct chemical analysis demonstrates that the complexes from MDCK cells are also enriched in neutral and acidic sphingolipids and cholesterol ; these lipids are also likely to be major constituents of the complexes prepared from the other sources , which have a low buoyant density on sucrose density gradients . Finally , the complexes from MDCK cells , lung , and gizzard are enriched the proposed caveolar coat protein caveolin or VIP21 ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) . Whether the protein - lipid complexes that form in deter - gent extracts are identical to , or are derived from , structures that exist in intact cells has been a subject of considerable debate . One idea has been that the complexes represent non - clathrin - coated invaginations of the plasma membrane known as caveolae . Caveolae are abundant in endothelial cells , smooth muscle cells , and fibroblasts , and it has been B . - . R8 - - ~ - - Go ~ !

The concentration of each G protein subunit was expressed as units of immunoreactivity divided by units of total protein in each fraction , the latter determined by scanning the cor - responding lane of the blot after staining with Coomassie Blue ( see Materials and Methods ) . The concentration on the ordinate is given in arbitrary units . Each of the G protein subunits is enriched in the same region of the gradient ( fractions 5 - 7 ) that contains most of the GPI - anchored chPrP and DAF ( compare with Fig . 3 , B ) . proposed that they play a role in a number of apparently dis - parate processes , including transcytosis , uptake of extracellu - lar nutrient molecules ( potocytosis ) , calcium transport , and transmembrane signaling ( reviewed by Anderson , 1993a , b ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ) . The property of detergent insolubility forms the basis for two recent purification schemes for caveo - lae ( Lisanti et al . , 1994a ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) . The results reported here clearly demonstrate that , at least in some cell types , the insoluble protein - lipid complexes that form when cells are extracted with non - ionic detergents are not the same as caveolae . The detergent - resistant complexes we isolate from N2a neuroblastoma cells , which lack mor - phologically identifiable caveolae and do not express caveo - lin ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) , have all the essential properties of the complexes prepared from sources that are rich in caveo - lae , such as MDCK cells , lung , and gizzard . First , they are enriched in multiple glycolipid - anchored proteins , including chPrP and DAF , as well as in a number of unidentified PIPLC - releasable proteins that can be surface biotinylated . Second , the complexes from N2a cells contain several cyto - plasmic signaling molecules , including the ai , c ~ o , and / 3 ~ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins , and the src - family tyrosine kinases fyn and yes ; moreover , protein kinases pres - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 624 Figure 6 . The src - family tyrosine kinases fyn and yes are enriched in Triton - resistant complexes , which display kinase activity in vitro . ChPrP - expressing N2a cells were extracted and fractionated on a continuous sucrose gradient as described in the legend to Fig . 3 . ( A ) Fractions were immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize either fyn or yes ( 60 kD ) . ( B ) Films of the blots were quantitated by densitometry , and the concentration of each of the kinases was expressed per unit of total protein in each fraction , as described in the legend to Fig . 5 / ~ Each of the kinases is enriched in the same region of the gradient ( fractions 6 and 7 ) that contains most of the GPI - anchored chPrP and DAF ( compare with Fig . 3 , B ) . ( C ) Triton - resistant complexes from chPrP - expressing N2a cells were collected at 15 - 20 % sucrose after equilibrium centrifugation on su - crose gradients , as described in A and B . One set of samples was incubated with [ 32P ] - - y - ATP for 0 min ( lane 1 ) or 15 min ( lane 2 ) , and then analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . A second set of samples was incubated with non - radioactive ATP for 0 min ( lane 3 ) or 15 min ( lane 4 ) , and then immunoblotted using an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody . Multiple proteins in the isolated com - plexes are phosphorylated in vitro , some of them on tyrosine . The arrow indicates the position of a prominent group of tyrosine - phos - phorylated proteins near 55 - 60 kD that are likely to include fyn , yes , and perhaps other proteins of the src - family . ent in the complexes are catalytically active , as demonstrated by in vitro kinase assays . Third , in electron micrographs , the complexes from N2a cells are seen to consist of membra - nous vesicles of 200 - 800 - nm - diam , similar in appearance to those from MDCK cells . Fourth , the physical properties of complexes are typical : they are large ( > 2 x 107 D ) , eluting in the void volume from a Sepharose 4B gel filtration column , and pelleting after centrifugation at 150 , 000 g ; and they have a low buoyant density , floating at 15 - 20 % su - crose after isopycnic centrifugation . Finally , preliminary thin - layer chromatographic analysis confirms the presence of glycosphingolipids in the complexes ( unpublished data ) . Our results do not rule out the possibility that , in other cell types , detergent - resistant complexes might be derived from caveolae . The complexes might represent microdomains of Figure 7 . Triton - resistant complexes are membranous vesicles of heterogeneous size and shape . Complexes isolated from chPrP - expressing N2a cells by centrifugation on a continuous sucrose gradient were analyzed by thin - section electron microscopy . Bar , 500 nm . the plasma membrane that are present in both N2a cells and MDCK cells , but N2a cells might not express one or more components that allow these domains to assume the invagi - nated form of caveolae . This component might be caveolin , a hypothesis that could be tested by determining whether N2a cells transfected with a caveolin cDNA produce mor - phologically recognizable caveolae . On the other hand , re - cent work suggests that caveolin may not be an essential com - ponent of caveolae ( Smart et al . , 1994 ) , thus arguing that other unidentified molecules may be important . In any case , the components we have detected in the complexes from N2a cells , including GPI - anchored proteins , kinases , G proteins , and probably lipids , are clearly insufficient on their own for the formation of caveolae . The results presented here are similar to those of Fra et al . ( 1994 ) , who recently reported that several lymphoid cell lines lack caveolae by thin - section electron microscopy , and do not express caveolin protein or mRNA . When detergent extracts of these cells were analyzed by sucrose gradient cen - trifugation , thy - 1 , a GPI - anchored protein , as well as the gan - glioside G ~ were found in the low - density region of the gradient . Presumably , this result reflects the existence of detergent - resistant complexes in lymphoid cell lysates , al - Gorodinsky and Harris GPl - anchored Proteins in Neuroblastoma Cells 625 B lOO E eo E 2O 0 Figure 8 . - - 0 - - Clathrln HC ¢ , , , , , . . . . , , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Fractlon number Triton - resistant complexes do not contain clathrin . ChPrP - expressing N2a cells were extracted and fractionated on a continuous sucrose gradient as described in the legend to Fig . 3 . Fractions were immunoblotted with antibodies to either clathrin heavy chain or chPrP ( A ) . The film of the immunoblot was quanti - tated by densitometry ( B ) . though the distribution of other components such as G - pro - tein subunits and tyrosine kinases was not examined . Our results differ significantly from those of two recent studies of detergent - resistant complexes from Fisher rat thy - roid ( FRT ) cells , a line of epithelial cells which , like N2a cells , lack caveolin protein and mRNA ( Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Zurzolo et al . , 1994 ) . Both of these studies conclude that complexes from FRT cells are incomplete . Although they are rich in glycosphingolipids , they are reported to ex - clude a model GPI - anchored protein ( gD1 - DAF ) , to be largely devoid of surface - labeled and metabolically labeled proteins , and to contain little in vitro phosphorylation activ - ity . Both studies also suggest that the deficiencies in the FRT complexes are due to the absence of caveolin , which is pro - posed to play a role in recruiting GPI - anchored proteins and other elements to the complex , and which is enriched in complexes from MDCK cells , lung , and gizzard . In contrast , we have found that the complexes from N2a cells possess all of the components found in complexes from MDCK cells . A reasonable explanation for this discrepancy is that caveolin is not essential for the integrity of the complexes , and that FRT cells , but not N2a cells , lack other molecules essential for organizing the complexes . We have previously reported that chPrP is endocytosed via clathrin - coated pits in N2a cells ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . In the present study , we found that , after isopycnic centrifugation , the majority of clathrin heavy chain was found near the bot - tom of the gradient and in the pellet , well separated from the majority of the chPrP , which was present in the low - density fractions ( Fig . 8 ) . This result , along with our electron micro - scopic analysis of the low - density fractions ( Fig . 7 ) , indicates that most of the chPrP in N2a cells is found in detergent - resis - tant complexes that are distinct from clathrin - coated vesi - cles , which would remain intact in 1 % Triton X - 100 and mi - grate to the bottom of the gradient because of their high density ( Woodward and Roth , 1978 ) . This observation is consistent with our previous EM morphometric analysis , which indicated that , although gold - labeled chPrP molecules were three - to fivetime more concentrated over clathrin - coated pits than over undifferentiated areas of plasma mem - brane , at steady state only 10 - 15 % of the total number of labeled molecules were localized over coated pits ( Table I of Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . This percentage might he accounted for by the small amount of chPrP that was always found in the pellet at the bottom of the tube after centrifugation of sucrose gradients ( data not shown ) . The chPrP molecules that not as - sociated with coated pits , and that can often be observed in clusters over undifferentiated areas of membrane ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) , presumably correspond to those that are found in low - density complexes after extraction of cells . Whether the clusters observed by microscopy are related to the deter - gent - resistant complexes , and whether chPrP remains asso - ciated with the complexes after recruitment into coated pits are questions that require further investigation . Although the study reported here has focused on N2a neu - roblastoma cells , the results may also be applicable to other neuronal cell lines , and to neurons , which also lack mor - phologically identifiable caveolae ( J . Heuser , personal com - munication ) , and which express only low levels of caveolin mRNA and protein ( Glenney , 1989 , 1992 ) . Indeed , we have been able to detect low - density , chPrP - containing complexes in Triton extracts of chicken brain synaptosomal membranes after centrifugation on sucrose density gradients ( Gorodin - sky et al . , 1994 ) . Although detergent - resistant complexes isolated from neu - ronal cells may not derive from caveolae , they may neverthe - less correspond to microdomains of surface or internal membranes that are present in intact cells , and that serve a physiological function . One possibility is that these domains play a role in polarized sorting of proteins in neurons , analo - gous to the role that has been proposed for them in epithelial cells ( Simons and Wadinger - Ness , 1990 ) . Another intrigu - ing possibility is that these domains operate in transmem - brane signaling . Antibody - induced cross - linking of a variety of GPI - anchored proteins on lymphocytes stimulates tyro - sine phosphorylation , elevation of cytoplasmic calcium , and mitogenesis ; the tyrosine kinases and G proteins associated with the detergent - resistant complexes have been proposed to mediate these responses ( Robinson , 1991 ; Brown , 1993 ) . Whether similar effects occur in neurons , and whether PrP c is involved , are interesting questions for future study . Finally , it will be important to investigate whether detergent - resis - tant domains play a role in the posttranslational conversion of PrP c into the scrapie isoform of the prion protein ( prps ~ ) , a process that is thought to occur either on the cell surface or in an endocytic compartment ( Caughey and Raymond , 1991 ; Borchelt et al . , 1992 ; Taraboulos et al . , 1994 ) • The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 626 We thank M .
