In this study , we assayed the 3D genomic contact proﬁles of a large number of CTCF binding sites with high - resolution 4C - seq . As recently reported , our data also suggest that chro - matin loops preferentially form between CTCF bind - ing sites oriented in a convergent manner . To directly test this , we used CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing to delete core CTCF binding sites in three loci , including the CTCF site in the Sox2 super - enhancer . In all in - stances , CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost , and chromatin loops with distal , convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized . Re - insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment , but did not re - establish chromatin loops . We conclude that CTCF binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher - order chromatin structure . INTRODUCTION Chromosome topology strongly inﬂuences genome function ( Bickmore and van Steensel , 2013 ; de Laat and Duboule , 2013 ) . Chromosomes are structurally subdivided into topologically associated domains ( TADs ) , evolutionarily and developmentally stable regions within which DNA sequences preferentially con - tact each other ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ; Sexton et al . , 2012 ) . TADs and their developmentally more dynamic sub - structures , called sub - TADs ( Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ) serve to functionally insulate intervening sequences . WithinTADs , chromatinloopscanbeformedbetweenenhancers and distant target genes to increase their transcription ( Deng et al . , 2012 ) . Boundaries between TADs hamper enhancer action on genes in other TADs ( Dowen et al . , 2014 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ; Symmons et al . , 2014 ) . CCCTC - binding factor ( CTCF ) is a developmentally essential protein ( Heath et al . , 2008 ) that plays a central role in the folding and segmentation of mammalian chromosomes ( Ong and Cor - ces , 2014 ) . CTCF binds to tens of thousands of genomic sites , > 60 % of which are bound in a tissue - invariant manner ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Faure et al . , 2012 ) . It has been implicated in gene activation , repression , and insulation ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Nakaha - shi et al . , 2013 ) . CTCF can form chromatin loops ( Splinter et al . , 2006 ) and is enriched at boundaries of topological domains ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Yaffe and Tanay , 2011 ) . CTCF sites engaged in chromatin looping are often co - occupied by cohesin , a protein complex that also binds to enhancers , independent of CTCF . Cohesin also actively contributes to loop formation , possibly through its capacity to embrace and hold together two DNA mol - ecules ( Hadjur et al . , 2009 ; Kagey et al . , 2010 ; Parelho et al . , 2008 ; Wendt et al . , 2008 ) . Based on depletion experiments , it is thought that CTCF is mainly involved in the segmentation of chromosomes , while cohesin may act more locally to organize structure within domains ( Seitan et al . , 2013 ; Sofueva et al . , 2013 ; Zuin et al . , 2014 ) . TherearemanymoreCTCFbindingsitesthanTADboundaries , and CTCF sites also far outnumber chromatin loops currently found per cell type ( Handoko et al . , 2011 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ) . This may be because genome - wide methods still lack the resolving power to detect all CTCF - bound loops . It can also be because only certain combinations of CTCF binding sites are capable of loop formation . It was recently shown that the great majority of CTCF chromatin loops involve pairs of sites with CTCF binding motifs oriented in a convergent manner ( Go´mez - Marı´n et al . , 2015 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ; Vietri Rudan et al . , 2015 ) . To further inves - tigate the relationship between CTCF binding polarity and chro - matin looping , we created high - resolution chromosome contact maps for a large number of CTCF sites . In addition , we studied the topological and functional consequences of deleting and in - verting speciﬁc CTCF sites at multiple genomic locations . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4C Peak Calling for Systematic Identiﬁcation of Chromatin Loops To analyze chromatin looping mediated by CTCF , we ﬁrst deﬁned the genome - wide occupancy of CTCF . We performed ChIP - seq in murine embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) and found 54 , 151 and 65 , 983 bound CTCF sites , respectively . The majority ( n = 37 , 298 ) of CTCF sites were found to be conserved between these two cell types . Based on the ChIP - seq data , we selected 86 CTCF sites for sub - sequent 4C analysis . 4C - seq is a method that generates detailed contact proﬁles of selected genomic sites . For comparison , the highest - resolution Hi - C map to date assays on average (cid:1) 750 Molecular Cell 60 , 1 – 9 , November 19 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 1 Please cite this article in press as : de Wit et al . , CTCF Binding Polarity Determines Chromatin Looping , Molecular Cell ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . molcel . 2015 . 09 . 023 independent contacts per individual restriction fragment ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) , whereas our 4C - seq proﬁles interrogate a minimum of 4 , 314 and up to 87 , 462 independent contacts per target site . 4C - seq may thus better resolve DNA interactions of individual sites at lower sequencing depth . In order to systematically identify chromatin loops in our com - pendium of 4C proﬁles , we developed a peak calling algorithm ( see Experimental Procedures for details ) . Brieﬂy , we deﬁne a peak as an increase in signal over ( perceived ) background . In contrast to ChIP - seq or related datasets , which have a close to uniform background distribution , 4C proﬁles have a strongly non - uniform data distribution ( Figure S1A ) . Importantly , this dis - tribution can differ between 4C experiments at different locations in the genome . The most important contributor to this phenome - non is distance toaTADborder .

To account for this , our algorithm explicitly models the background sepa - rately on each side of the viewpoint using monotonic regression . In a monotonic regression analysis , the signal is forced to decrease with increased distance , which is a fair assumption for an unstruc - tured chromatin ﬁber ( Rippe et al . , 1995 ) . The result is a regression line that closely follows the background distribution in a 4C experiment ( Figure S1B ) . Using a re - sampling - based statistical analysis ( see Experimental Procedures ) , we subse - quentlyidentifyregionsthatshowarobust increase over the background ( Fig - ure S1C ) . This method stringently detects chromatinloops . ComparedtoFourCSeq , a recently published analysis pipeline for 4C - seq data based on similar principles ( Klein et al . , 2015 ) , our analysis pipeline identiﬁes fewer contacts . The number of peaks we ﬁnd are more similar to the number chromatin loops identiﬁed in high - resolution Hi - C data ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) . Looping Preferentially Occurs between Convergent CTCF Motifs We investigated whether the correlation between CTCF binding site polarity and chromatin loops is also apparent in our 4C data . We identiﬁed the summits of called peaks ( i . e . , the highest value within a contacted region ) and with them associated the single nearest CTCF site , regardless of whether or not it also had cohe - sin associated . This enabled us to compare a CTCF site’s orien - tation to that of the 4C target CTCF site . Indeed , as was found by genome - wide high - resolution Hi - C contact maps ( Rao et al . , 2014 ; Vietri Rudan et al . , 2015 ) , loop formation preferentially occurred between convergent CTCF sites ( see Figure 1A for ex - amples ) . This was true not only for primary loops formed with the 2 Molecular Cell 60 , 1 – 9 , November 19 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Even the 20 % most distal contacts scored , which formed loops over 0 . 9 – 5 . 8 Mb , showed this preference for convergence ( Figure 1B ) . We found that (cid:1) 10 % – 20 % of chromatin loops occurred be - tween identically oriented CTCF sites , which is relatively high compared to previous Hi - C results ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) . We attri - bute this ﬁnding to the frequent close linear juxtaposition of divergent CTCF sites ( Pugacheva et al . , 2015 ) . 4C applied to one of these closely juxtaposed sites frequently results in the detection of loops both up - and downstream of the viewpoint , of which the equivalently oriented site is then necessarily misat - tributed . The all - versus - all nature of Hi - C better enables one to discern which of the juxtaposed CTCF sites is responsible for each oppositely oriented loop . We also generated 81 4C proﬁles from CTCF sites in NPCs . Here , we ﬁnd the same preference for convergent CTCF sites to form loops , with an almost equal preference for convergent sites in primary and secondary loops ( Figure 1C ) , despite the fact that some CTCF sites , most notably around tissue - speciﬁc genes , clearly showed tissue - speciﬁc contact proﬁles ( Fig - ure S1D ) . These results conﬁrm the importance of CTCF motif orientation in chromatin loop formation . Genome Editing for the Deletion and Inversion of Endogenous CTCF Sites To test the functional importance of CTCF binding polarity , we deleted and inverted a number of CTCF binding sites in ESCs . We selected target sites based on CTCF binding site motif orien - tation , efﬁcient recruitment of CTCF and cohesin ( both judged by ChIP - seq scores ) , and the formation of a convergent loop ( as judged by 4C - seq ) . Based on these criteria , three individual CTCF binding sites were selected ( Figure S2A ) , located near the genes Malt1 , Sox2 , and Fbn2 . We used the CRISPR / Cas9 system ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) with oligonucleotide repair templates to site - speciﬁcally modify the selected CTCF sites in murine ESCs . For CTCF binding site deletions , we removed 9 , 13 , and 16 bp of the core CTCF binding motif at the Malt1 , Fbn2 , and Sox2 loci , respectively , and replaced them by an EcoRI recogni - tion site ( GAATTC ) to facilitate screening ( Figure S2B ) . We ob - tained multiple homozygous deletion ( del / del ) clones for each targeted site . To invert the orientation of the CTCF binding sites , the same 9 , 13 , and 16 consensus base pairs were removed , but were re - placed by an inverted CTCF binding motif . To prevent the repair template from being targeted by the same guide RNA and modi - ﬁed by CRISPR / Cas9 , the replacement site had a different ( oppositely oriented ) CTCF binding motif . Since chromatin loops are mediated by associated proteins , we reasoned that this would well serve to test the importance of CTCF binding polarity as long as ( 1 ) our deletion clones showed complete absence of CTCF binding and ( 2 ) the reintroduced , oppositely oriented bind - ing motif fully restored CTCF binding . The result would be a phenocopied association of CTCF protein to the exact same genomic location , but now in an opposite orientation . For this purpose , we selected a binding site that efﬁciently recruits CTCF ( based on ChIP - seq ) and which we conﬁrmed participates in convergent looping by 4C - seq ( Figure S3 ) . This site was in - serted at all targeted locations as a 50 - bp sequence that con - tained both CTCF ‘‘core’’ and ‘‘downstream’’ binding modules ( ‘‘M1’’ and ‘‘M2’’ [ Schmidt et al . , 2012 ] ) . We obtained one clone with an inverted and an untargeted CTCF site ( inv / wt ) at the Malt1 locus , seven homozygous inversion clones ( inv / inv ) for the CTCF site near Sox2 , one homozygous inversion ( inv / inv ) clone for the CTCF site at Fbn2 ( with on both alleles only the ‘‘core’’ M1 binding module , not the M2 motif ) , and one clone with an inverted and a deleted CTCF site at the two Fbn2 alleles ( inv / del ) . All deletions and inversions were conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing ( Figures S2B and S3C ) . CTCF Binding Is Necessary for Loop Formation To evaluate the relevance of CTCF binding for chromatin loop - ing , we ﬁrst revisited an available transgenic mouse line carrying four mutated nucleotides in one of the CTCF binding sites ( 3 0 HS1 ) of the b - globin locus . We previously found that this mutant 3 0 HS1 fails to bind CTCF and no longer participates in loop formation with other CTCF sites , judged at the time by 3C technology ( Splinter et al . , 2006 ) . 4C - seq can provide a much more comprehensive overview of chromosome contact changes . It conﬁrmed that mutated 3 0 HS1 had strongly reduced contact frequencies with downstream CTCF sites at the other end of the b - globin locus , which indeed were in the convergent orientation ( Figure S2C ) . We then analyzed the del / del ESC clones we had obtained by genome editing . Importantly , ChIP conﬁrmed that CTCF binding was abolished in all del / del clones ( Figure 2A ) . Consistently , this was accompanied by loss of cohesin association with the target sites ( Figure 2B ) . 4C - seq uncovered that spatial contacts with the deleted sites were disrupted in the CTCF del / del clones to varying degrees . For example , upon deletion of the reverse ori - ented CTCF binding site centered at chr18 : 65 , 649 , 680 in the Malt1 locus ( indicated by scissors , Figure 2C ) , visual inspection of spatial contact proﬁles revealed the speciﬁc disruption of a chromatin loop with an upstream ( convergently oriented ) CTCF site nearly 200 kb away ( indicated by an asterisk , Fig - ure 2C ) . This loss of contact was conﬁrmed by the peak caller . The deleted site is the only one of multiple juxtaposed CTCF sites , all within 10 kb , that is in the reverse orientation . All others , of which the closest is less than 500 bp from the target site , are in the forward orientation . They are likely responsible for the downstream loops that we also score using this viewpoint . The primary downstream loop also appeared affected by the deletion , but to a lesser extent . These results may suggest that of the four clustered CTCF sites , the reversely oriented site is speciﬁcally responsible for the formation of the upstream loop . In the Sox2 locus , we deleted the sole CTCF site that is con - tained within the 13 kb super - enhancer recently described to loop toward the Sox2 gene and responsible for 90 % of its expression in ESCs ( Li et al . , 2014 ; Zhou et al . , 2014 ) . This CTCF site is in a convergent orientation with the CTCF site at the promoter of Sox2 ( Figure 2D ) and is surrounded by se - quences within (cid:1) 5 kb that efﬁciently recruit cohesin apparently in a CTCF - independent manner ( Figure S2A ) ( Whyte et al . , Molecular Cell 60 , 1 – 9 , November 19 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 3 Please cite this article in press as : de Wit et al . , CTCF Binding Polarity Determines Chromatin Looping , Molecular Cell ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . molcel . 2015 . 09 . 023 2013 ) . Abrogating CTCF binding at the enhancer clearly re - duced , but did not abolish , enhancer - promoter contacts , sug - gesting that CTCF is only partially responsible for the pro - moter - enhancer loop in the Sox2 locus ( Figure 2D ) . Note that our peak caller misses the clear chromatin loop formed between the super enhancer and the Sox2 gene . This is because the pres - ence of a broad peak relatively close to the viewpoint leads to a background distribution that is relatively high , resulting in a signal that does not reach our strict threshold for peak calling . At the Fbn2 locus , deletion of the forward - oriented CTCF bind - ing site centered at chr18 : 58 , 136 , 460 abolished the wild - type loop formed with a convergent CTCF site more than 400 kb downstream of the target site ( Figure 2E ) . An oppositely oriented loop with a forward oriented CTCF site (cid:1) 350 kb upstream of the target site was mildly destabilized . Presumably this loop relied more on the reversely oriented CTCF site near the target site ( Fig - ures 2E and S2A ) . We validated the results by generating 4C - seq proﬁles at the originally contacted CTCF sites ( asterisks , Figures 2C – 2E ) . In wild - type cells , these showed chromatin looping with the target sites , as expected . These loops were abolished in the Malt1 del / del and Fbn2 del / del clones and destabilized in the Sox2 del / del A B C D E F G Figure 2 .

Notably , none of these three contacting CTCF sites showed speciﬁc new loops to other CTCF sites . Judging by their CTCF and cohesin occu - pancy ( Figures 2F and 2G ) , this was not because they had intrin - sically lost looping capacity . Productive loop formation therefore also seems to rely on genomic context . Inverted CTCF Sites Restore CTCF Binding but Not Chromatin Looping Next , we analyzed the impact of re - inserting an oppositely ori - ented CTCF binding motif at the same three sites that no longer bound CTCF or cohesin in the deletion clones . At the Sox2 and Fbn2 sites , for which we had homozygous inv / inv clones , this fully restored CTCF recruitment ( Figure 3A ) . Cohesin was also re - cruited , albeit with varying efﬁciency ( Figure 3B ) . At the Malt1 lo - cus , for which we only obtained a heterozygous inv / wt clone , ChIP followed by semiquantitative PCR analysis conﬁrmed that the inverted site bound CTCF and cohesin at least as efﬁciently as its wild - type counterpart on the other allele ( Figure S3D ) . The inverted sites are therefore indiscernible from the wild - type sites with respect to CTCF binding as assayed by ChIP . Their chromo - somal contact proﬁles , however , were different from wild - type A B C D E F G Figure 3 .

The heterozygous inv / wt site at the Malt1 locus selectively lost contacts with the upstream CTCF site at 200 kb ( asterisk , Fig - ure 3C ) , as also was seen upon deleting the site . The inverted CTCF site in the Sox2 super - enhancer showed a reduction in contact frequencies with the Sox2 promoter ( Figure 3D ) , albeit less obvious than seen after deleting the site . Finally , the inverted CTCF binding motif at the Fbn2 locus caused disruption of the same > 400 kb downstream chromatin loop that was also lost upon deletion of this same CTCF binding site ( Figure 3E ) . In none of the three instances did we ﬁnd evidence for the inverted CTCF site engaging in new , oppositely oriented chromatin loops ( Figures 3C – 3E ) . Reciprocal 4C - seq experiments that looked from the originally contacted CTCF sites conﬁrmed disruption of the chromatin loops at the Malt1 and Fbn2 loci and also conﬁrmed a slightly reduced contact frequency between the Sox2 promoter and enhancer ( Figures 3C – 3E ) . These proﬁles likewise revealed no engagement of the originally contacted A B C Figure 4 .

See also Figure S4 . sites in new replacement loops , despite unal - tered cohesin and CTCF recruitment to these sites ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . Chromatin Loop Disruption May Alter Gene Expression Finally , we addressed whether changes in chromatin architecture would affect the expression of nearby genes . We previously found no difference in b - globin gene expres - sion in fetal livers carrying a CTCF binding site mutation in 3 0 HS1 ( Splinter et al . , 2006 ) . Deletion ( del / del ) or inversion ( inv / wt ) of the CTCF site at the Malt1 locus did not alter the expression level of the gene contained within the disrupted chromatin loop ( Malt1 ; the other gene , Alpk2 , is not active ) , nor the levels of Nedd4l , the gene ﬂanking the original loop ( Figure 4A ) . At the Sox2 locus , contact frequencies between the promoter and the CTCF site in the super - enhancer were reduced , yet this led to no ( inv / inv ) or only a subtle ( del / del ) reduction in Sox2 expression ( Figure 4B ) . At the Fbn2 locus , however , we found that the Fbn2 gene , contained within the wild - type chromatin loop , was upregu - lated 1 . 5 - to 2 . 5 - fold . This was consistently found with two independent qPCR primer sets for ﬁve independent del / del clones as well as the inv / inv clone , as compared to six independent clones carrying a wild - type Fbn2 locus ( Figures 4C and S4 ) . This implies that disruption of the encompassing CTCF loop leads to Fnb2 upregulation . Expression levels of the more downstream gene Isoc1 varied more than 2 - fold between all independent clones ( Figure S4 ) , but this appeared unrelated to the targeting of the CTCF site . The example of Fbn2 demonstrates that in a genomic context indistinguishable from wild - type by ChIP , a gene can be expressed at different levels because of an oppositely oriented chromatin - associated CTCF molecule (cid:1) 230 kb downstream of its transcriptional start site . Collectively , we have shown that deletion of a few nucleotides that abolish CTCF binding is sufﬁcient to speciﬁcally disrupt chromatin loops between convergent CTCF sites . In all cases , re - introduction of an oppositely oriented 50 bp CTCF binding motif resulted in a CTCF site that is indistinguishable by ChIP from the original wild - type site . Yet the oppositely oriented CTCF molecules were unable to re - establish the original chro - matin loops . We therefore conclude that CTCF binding polarity 6 Molecular Cell 60 , 1 – 9 , November 19 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Our data are in agreement with the recent demonstration that inversion of a kilobase - sized region carrying multiple CTCF / cohesin sites af - fects chromosome topology and expression ( Guo et al . , 2015 ) . However , rather than inverting a genomic region , our genome editing experiments only speciﬁcally disrupt single CTCF binding sites . The inverted sites behaved like CTCF - depleted sites : they not only lost the ability to form chromatin loops in one direction , but they also did not engage in speciﬁc contacts with CTCF sites in the other direction . The same was true for the disen - gaged CTCF sites ( i . e . , the original looping partners ) , which also did not form new long - range contacts with other CTCF sites . The observation that cohesin association at these sites persists when disengaged suggests that cohesin recruitment to CTCF sites is independent of stable chromatin loop forma - tion . Loop formation by CTCF therefore also seems dependent on chromosomal context , most likely requiring the availability of compatible binding sites in close enough linear proximity and a local 3D conﬁguration that can facilitate loop formation . A super - enhancer , with CTCF - independent associated cohe - sin , seems capable of efﬁcient looping to a gene promoter even without the help of paired CTCF sites , as seen here for the Sox2 locus . Although disruption of CTCF - anchored loops does not always cause dysregulation of genes , it can lead to gene expression changes . This was recently seen in rostral motor neurons , where disruption of a CTCF site caused ectopic HoxA7 expression ( Narendra et al . , 2015 ) , as well as here for the Fbn2 gene , which was upregulated by both the deletion and inversion of a CTCF site (cid:1) 230 kb away from its transcription start site . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES CTCF ChIP - Seq , ChIP - qPCR , and 4C ChIP was performed according to standard protocols using 6 m l anti - CTCF ( Millipore # 07 - 729 ) and 7 m l anti - Rad21 ( Abcam # ab992 ) antibody per ChIP , respectively . ChIP - seq was performed with anti - CTCF antibody ( Millipore # 07 - 729 ) according to manufacturer protocol , with slight modiﬁcations ( see Supplemental Information ) . 4C templates were prepared as previously described ( Splinter et al . , 2012 ) . 4C Peak Calling In contrast to , for example , ChIP - seq , the background in a 4C experiment is distributed non - uniformly . To perform peak calling , we explicitly model the background of up - and downstream genomic regions independently . We as - sume that in an unstructured chromatin ﬁber the contact proﬁle is the result of random encounters between genomic loci . Therefore , the contact probabil - itymonotonically decreases as afunction of distance to the viewpoint . By per - forming monotonic regression of the 4C signal as a function of distance to the viewpoint , we can model this decay . This is done using the Pool Adjacent - Vi - olators Algorithm ( PAVA ) from the R package isotone , which is an implemen - tation of monotonic regression ( de Leeuw et al . , 2009 ) . Preferential contacts are deﬁned as windows ( n = 21 ) that show an increase over the background model . To identify regions that show a robust increase over the background , ouralgorithmcontainsthefollowingsteps : ( 1 ) topreventspuriouspeakcalling , we subsample 80 % of the 4C data and recalculate the 4C scores to mitigate the effect of outliers ( this process is repeated 1 , 000 times ) ; ( 2 ) we only select windows where the average subsampled 4C score is 1 . 2 - fold over the back - ground in more than 99 . 5 % of the iterations ; and ( 3 ) we select only windows where the average 4C score is at least 50 reads / million over the background distribution . Peaks should be at least 5 kb in size and more than 40 kb from the viewpoint . Within the peak region , we identify the window with the highest coverage , which we call the summit of the peak ( see also Supplemental Information ) . Genome Editing CellsweretransfectedusingLipofectamine2000 ( LifeTechnologies ) permanu - facturer protocol ; each transfection was performed using 4 m g pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX459 , a gift from Feng Zhang [ Addgene plasmid # 48139 ] ) and 4 m g ssODN repair template ( IDT ) . After 12 – 14 hr , cells were replated at low density . Twenty - four hours later , cells were placed under puromycin selection ( 1 . 8 m g / ml ) for 48 hr . Individual colonies were picked and seeded in 96 - well plates . For details , gRNAs , and repair templates , see Supplemental Information . Expression Analysis Each qPCR was performed in triplicate per PCR plate , and all experiments were repeated two more times such that the average of nine measurements represents the expression value of a given clone . For expression analysis at the Malt1 locus , expression values from two wild - type clones , two del / del clones , and the one inv / wt clone were compared . For Sox2 expression anal - ysis , expression values from ﬁve wild - type clones , ﬁve del / del clones , and ﬁve inv / inv clones were compared . For expression analysis at the Fbn2 locus , expression values from six wild - type clones , ﬁve del / del clones , one inv / inv clone , and one inv / del clone were compared .
