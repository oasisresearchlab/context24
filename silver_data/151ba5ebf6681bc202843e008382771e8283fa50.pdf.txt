In this study , we described the dynamics of COVID - 19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U . S . Methods : Using data from April 1 to November 12 , 2020 , from Johns Hopkins University , we estimated COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level , and in states with higher and lower COVID - 19 incidence rates . Results : Results at the national level showed greater COVID - 19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid - Atlantic regions of the U . S . at the beginning of the epidemic . However , the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas . In particular , high incidence states located in the Mid - west of the country had more than 3 , 400 COVID - 19 cases per 100 , 000 people compared to 1 , 284 cases per 100 , 000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period ( August 30 to November 12 ) . Conclusions : Overall , the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas . Infection prevention and control efforts including healthcare capacity should be scaled up in these vulnerable rural areas .

S . ) has the highest number of COVID - 19 cases in the world , with 13 , 386 , 255 confirmed cases as of November 29 , 2020 . From the beginning of May to mid - November 2020 , the number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in the U . S . has steadily increased , whereas the rate of COVID - 19 - related hospitalizations and mortality has declined . 1 However , there is substantial spatial and temporal variation in the dynamics of the epidemic within the U . S . , 2 - 4 with New York , New Jersey and Maryland experiencing the highest burden of the infection early in the epidemic . The epicenter of the disease shifted to the southern U . S . from June to September of 2020 , followed by a surge in the Midwest in late September . Furthermore , there is a growing concern about the epidemic worsening in rural areas , which are characterized by lower healthcare capacity , thus placing residents at higher risk of COVID - 19 infection and death . 4 - 6 Rural areas in the United States face many challenges including lower healthcare resources compared to urban communities . For example , over 4 . 7 million people live in 460 rural counties across the nation where there are no general medical or surgical hospital beds . In addition , 16 . 4 million people live in rural areas with no medical / surgical intensive care unit ( ICU ) beds . 7 Rural residents have a shorter life expectancy than urban residents and rural households also report a lower median income . 8 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , older people are at the highest risk of COVID - 19 morbidity and mortality . 9 In the 2016 U . S . Census , the median age of rural area residents was 51 years , whereas the median age in urban areas was 45 . 10 Rural communities also have a larger proportion of residents 65 years and older ( 18 . 4 % compared to 14 . 5 % ) . 8 The proportion of older adults is increasing more quickly in rural communities due to declining birth rates and migration patterns in younger adults . 11 5 With rural communities already at a disadvantage in terms of healthcare and population demographics , and with COVID - 19 proving to be a more intense burden on older populations , rural areas are in greater danger compared to urban areas . In this study , we estimated COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates to compare urban and rural areas in the U . S . during three time periods in 2020 . METHODS COVID - 19 data from April 1 to November 12 , 2020 , obtained from Johns Hopkins University 12 for 3 , 108 counties in the 48 contiguous U . S . states , were used in our analyses . The study dataset contained records for 10 , 143 , 327 COVID - 19 cases and 234 , 186 COVID - 19 related deaths . We classified counties as rural or urban based on the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics urban classification methodology . 13 The criteria for metropolitan ( urban ) counties ranges from small metropolitan areas with population size less than 250 , 000 people to large metropolitan areas with more than one million people , and nonmetropolitan ( rural ) counties are those with population less than 50 , 000 . 1 , 160 counties were classified as urban ( blue in Supplementary Figure 1 ) and 1 , 948 as rural counties ( purple in Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Population density per county in 2019 was obtained from ESRI estimates derived from the 2010 U . S . Census population count . 14 We estimated temporal changes in COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates in urban and rural areas by evaluating three 75 - day time intervals in 2020 . The first - time interval from April 1 to June 15 included the time of initiation of intervention measures against the pandemic ( i . e . , lockdowns and stay home orders ) . Interventions were eased during the second time interval from June 16 to August 29 , while the third interval from August 30 to November 12 6 corresponded to the surge of the third wave of the epidemic in the U . S . To illustrate temporal changes in both COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates , we generated choropleth maps at the county level to compare rates in each period . We also categorized states into two groups based on incidence rates . States in the highest quartile of COVID - 19 incidence rates in the third period ( that illustrates the current stage of the epidemic at the moment in which the study was conducted ) were included in the ― higher incidence rate states ‖ , while the remaining states were included in the ― lower incidence rate states ‖ , and these groups were used as reference to retrospectively generate comparison between groups during the three periods . To estimate the COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rate for each period , we analyzed data on urban and rural cases at the national level as well as by high / low incidence states for each time interval . For example , we calculated the incidence rate in an urban area as the number of cases divided by the population size of the area ( with the result reported per 100 , 000 people ) , and then calculated a 95 % confidence interval for a Poisson rate using an exact method with the ―pois . exact‖ function in the R environment . 15 We conducted comparisons of the COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates between urban and rural areas among the three different time intervals at the national level , and in the states with higher and lower COVID - 19 incidence rates by computing Poisson rates of COVID - 19 incidence ( or mortality ) for two different time periods . In this analysis it is assumed that ( incidence or mortality ) counts Y and X at two time periods vary according to Poisson distributions , ~ ( ) y Y Poisson n  and ~ ( ) x X Poisson m  , and the parameter of interest is the rate ratio between the two time periods , / y x     . The values n and m are the number of persons at risk in each time period considered . We used the uniformly most powerful unbiased procedure for estimating rate ratios . This procedure is based on conditioning on the sum X + Y , yielding 7 | ~ ( , ( ) ) Y X Y k Binomial k p    where ( ) y y x n n p n m n m           . Rate ratio analyses were conducted using the rateratio . test package in the R environment version 3 . 5 . 2 . 15 This study followed the guidelines of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) 16 . RESULTS There was a total of 8 , 613 , 630 cases and 204 , 873 deaths from COVID - 19 in urban areas , and 1 , 529 , 697 cases and 29 , 313 deaths in rural areas during the entire study period . North Dakota ( ND ; 6 , 255 COVID - 19 cases per 100 , 000 people ) , South Dakota ( SD ; 5 , 400 ) , Wisconsin ( WI ; 4 , 032 ) , Iowa ( IA ; 3 , 384 ) , Montana ( MT ; 3 , 338 ) , Nevada ( NE ; 3 , 008 ) , Wyoming ( WY ; 2 , 884 ) , Utah ( UT ; 2 , 872 ) , Idaho ID ; ( 2 , 607 ) , Illinois ( IL ; 2 , 407 ) , Kansas ( KS ; 2 , 394 ) , and Missouri ( MO ; 2 , 355 ) were states in the highest COVID - 19 incidence rates quartile during the third period and were categorized as ― higher incidence rate states ‖ , with an average of 2 , 946 cases per 100 , 000 people ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 2 , 940 – 2 , 951 ) . The remaining states were classified as ― lower incidence rate states ‖ , with an average of 1 , 152 cases per 100 , 000 people ( 95 % CI : 1 , 151 – 1 , 154 ) in the third time period ( Figure ) . We found that COVID - 19 incidence rates were higher in rural counties , compared to urban counties , in the third period in 10 of the 12 higher incidence states ( SD , WI , IA , MT , NE , WY , ID , IL , KS , MO ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) . 8 The Table presents estimates of COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates at the national level , as well as for higher and lower incidence rate states for the three periods . Nationally , the COVID - 19 incidence rate was higher in urban counties compared to rural counties in the first two periods , but rural counties had the highest incidence rate in the third period . The COVID - 19 incidence rate in rural counties increased by over 180 % from the first to the second period ( rate ratio [ RR ] : 2 . 86 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 85 – 2 . 88 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , and by over 80 % from the second to the third period ( RR : 1 . 88 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 87 - 1 . 88 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . In urban counties , the incidence rate increased by 90 % from the first to the second period ( RR : 1 . 92 ; 95 % CI ; 1 . 91 – 1 . 93 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , but remained almost the same from the second to the third period , with a modest increase of only 9 % . Among the higher incidence rate states , incidence rates were significantly higher during the first two periods in urban counties . In the third period , the incidence rate was more than 25 % higher in rural compared to urban counties ( RR : 1 . 27 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 26 – 1 . 28 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Nationally , COVID - 19 mortality rates sharply declined in urban areas over time , with the highest decline occurring between the first and second time periods ( RR : 0 . 55 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 54 - 0 . 56 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , and then declined 30 % from the second to the third period ( RR : 0 . 76 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 75 – 0 . 77 ) . Conversely , COVID - 19 related mortality across the nation significantly increased in rural areas from the first to the second period ( RR : 1 . 43 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 38 – 1 . 48 ; p < 0 . 001 ) and had the highest increase , with more than 50 % increase in the mortality rate from the second to the third period ( RR : 1 . 55 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 51 – 1 . 59 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . The highest mortality rate occurred in rural states with higher incidence rate during the third period , with a COVID - 19 related mortality rate of 35 . 52 per 100 , 000 people ( 95 % CI : 34 . 43 – 36 . 63 ) . DISCUSSION 9 We assessed the patterns of COVID - 19 incidence and mortality rates during intervention and post - intervention periods for rural and urban counties in the U . S . Our results suggest that the COVID - 19 landscape in the U . S . is dynamic with substantial changes over time and space . Although results at the national level indicated greater COVID - 19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid - Atlantic regions of the U . S . at the beginning of the epidemic , the intensity of the epidemic shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas , particularly in high incidence states located in the Mid - west of the country with more than 3 , 400 cases per 100 , 000 people ( compared to 1 , 284 cases estimated for urban counties ) during the third period . Urban counties experienced a rapid increase of COVID - 19 infections after easing of lockdown restrictions in the second period ( June 16 – August 29 , 2020 ) , but infection rates remained stable during the third period ( August 30 – November 12 ) . Conversely , there was a rapid surge of infections in rural areas with an incidence rate increasing from about 350 cases per 100 , 000 people in the first period to more than 1 , 000 cases in the second period , and contrary to the pattern observed in urban areas , the infection rate continued increasing in rural counties , reaching almost 2 , 000 cases in the third period . Reasons for the differential temporal dynamics between urban and rural areas can be manifold . COVID - 19 infection rates were lower on average in rural than in urban counties in the early stages of the epidemic . In large urban areas , the susceptibility driven by high population density and enhanced connectivity forced the implementation of strict non - pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns and social distancing practices , which reduced the community spread of infection in these areas . As a result , the pandemic may be showing signs of receding in large metropolitan areas , but continued to diffuse from cities to rural communities , which are communities that might have implemented less intensive interventions . For example effective 10 non - pharmaceutical measures such as face covering have been met with some resistance among rural communities in the U . S . 17 With the slow rollout of vaccination in the country , masks remain one of the few control measures available for protection against the virus as they serve as a physical barrier for virus dispersion . 18 Although mask wearing has been found to be an effective and proactive public health tool against virus dispersion , some studies have identified lower frequency of mask use in public areas in rural compared to urban counties . 17 These studies found that wearing a mask was about four times greater in urban than in rural areas , possibly reflecting a perception of lower risk of COVID - 19 infection in rural communities . Although COVID - 19 mortality has declined nationally , this decline was only observed in urban areas , whereas the mortality rate has increased more than 100 % from the first to the third period in the rural counties . COVID - 19 mortality is steadily declining in urban areas , with the largest decline of 45 % from the first to the second period , and with a smaller decline of 30 % from the second to the third period . Conversely , mortality rate in rural areas is steadily increasing , with an increase of about 40 % from the first to the second period , and with the largest increased occurring between the second to the third period , with about 55 % increase in the COVID - 19 mortality rate . Reasons for these disparities in the mortality rates between urban and rural areas can be linked to a shift in the demographic groups most affected by the epidemic . Younger populations in urban counties are currently experiencing the largest burden of infection . This demographic group has better infection outcomes , with lower infection complications , hospitalizations , and consequently COVID - 19 related deaths . 19 Conversely , many of the risk factors for COVID - 19 infection complications are exacerbated in rural areas , particularly in older adults . Rural areas have older populations , 20 on average , with more underlying medical conditions than suburban and urban communities . 21 It is estimated that about 50 % of rural 11 residents are at high risk for hospitalization and COVID - 19 related complications , compared to 40 % in metropolitan areas . In addition , rural populations are older and have lower general health conditions than urban populations , and therefore they are vulnerable populations at higher risk of COVID - 19 related hospitalization and deaths , with an estimated 10 % higher hospitalization rate for COVID - 19 per capita than urban residents given equal infection rates . 22 Additionally , major vulnerabilities in rural areas include fewer physicians and lack of access to intensive care and ventilators , which are key aspects of care needed for the at least 5 % of critical COVID - 19 infection related complications . 23 Health care facilities within rural communities are typically less well - resourced with reduced access to personal protective equipment , lower access to ICU beds , testing , and the necessary equipment to effectively treat people most severely affected by COVID - 19 infection complications , which are commonly older adults . 24 As a result , many rural hospitals find themselves needing to transfer residents with more serious cases of COVID - 19 to larger facilities in urban areas for treatment . 25 Hospital transfers require time and that can affect disease outcomes in critical situations , and relocating patients during the current wave of COVID - 19 to urban areas may present additional challenges if the receiving hospital is already overwhelmed . 22 As the U . S . begins its massive vaccine rollout , health departments across the country are scrambling to plan and adjust their vaccination plans , often while simultaneously managing a surge in new COVID - 19 cases , particularly in rural areas . The geography can also compound disparities in access that affect rural clinics , which face unique challenges to provide vaccinations to residents who live many miles away . Rural communities often run short on resources including cold vaccine storage facilities or healthcare workers to administer vaccines . 12 Additionally , it has been shown that rural residents are less likely to receive flu shots than residents of urban areas 26 . This tendency combined with the hesitancy of rural communities to adopt other COVID - 19 mitigation measures , can facilitate the surge of pockets of the virus in some rural areas of the country , from which it could reemerge into the broader population , compromising efforts to get the virus under control . Therefore , public information campaigns and vaccine promotions along with the setup of new sites for vaccinations in rural underserved areas become important strategies to target vulnerable populations in rural communities . The COVID - 19 pandemic has continued to spread , causing many deaths around the world . Analysis of setting - specific data is paramount in understanding local transmission dynamics of the disease and designing effective public health responses . 2 , 27 Our findings suggest that the pandemic in the U . S . is composed of sub - epidemics with different temporal dynamics and spatial patterns that could potentially present challenges in disease control within the country . The disease has manifested itself in different spatial and temporal ways in urban and rural areas . The current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection intensity and mortality in rural areas , and higher incidence states are currently experiencing a significant increase in the rate of COVID - 19 related deaths in both urban and rural areas . CONCLUSIONS A high burden of infection combined with lower healthcare capacity in rural areas implies that residents in these vulnerable areas are at higher risk of COVID - 19 infection and related morbidity and mortality during the current stage of the epidemic in the U . S . 4 , 28 Clinicians and public health policy makers must tailor intervention strategies to suit local needs . Public health policies should take into account county - level interventions and strategies specific to each type 13 of community ( urban or rural ) . When making public health policies , the local government should be aware of , and consider , the differences in COVID - 19 spread between urban and rural areas , which will allow more effective disease control . With increasing incidence rates in rural areas , residents must be made aware of their increased risk of infection so they can take personal measures to protect themselves , and Critical Access Hospitals must continue to receive Federal funding , as they are crucial to treating patients in rural areas . Health partnerships must also be made to coordinate data and updates about COVID - 19 , and to share valuable resources , such as personal protective equipment . Efforts focused on decreasing disease spread and strengthening the healthcare capacity in the vulnerable rural areas would benefit rural communities and limit the spread of COVID - 19 disease in the current geographical epicenter of the epidemic in the U . S .
