Gottschalk 5 , Manuel Théry 2 , Matthias Mann 3 and Reinhard Fässler 1 , 7 How different integrins that bind to the same type of extracellular matrix protein mediate speciﬁc functions is unclear . We report the functional analysis of β 1 - and α v - class integrins expressed in pan - integrin - null ﬁbroblasts seeded on ﬁbronectin . Reconstitution with β 1 - class integrins promotes myosin - II - independent formation of small peripheral adhesions and cell protrusions , whereas expression of α v - class integrins induces the formation of large focal adhesions . Co - expression of both integrin classes leads to full myosin activation and traction - force development on stiff ﬁbronectin - coated substrates , with α v - class integrins accumulating in adhesion areas exposed to high traction forces . Quantitative proteomics linked α v - class integrins to a GEF - H1 – RhoA pathway coupled to the formin mDia1 but not myosin II , and α 5 β 1 integrins to a RhoA – Rock – myosin II pathway . Our study assigns speciﬁc functions to distinct ﬁbronectin - binding integrins , demonstrating that α 5 β 1 integrins accomplish force generation , whereas α v - class integrins mediate the structural adaptations to forces , which cooperatively enable cells to sense the rigidity of ﬁbronectin - based microenvironments . Integrins are α / β heterodimers that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and to receptors on other cells 1 , thereby regulating numerous biological processes that are essential for development , postnatalhomeostasisandpathology 1 – 4 . Themammalian genome encodes 18 α and 8 β integrin genes , which form 24 heterodimers . Mammalian cells usually co - express several integrins , which recognize ECM components by binding specific amino - acid stretches such as the Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) motif 1 , 5 . RGD motifs are found in many matrix proteins including fibronectin , in which RGD mediates binding to α 5 β 1 and all α v - class integrins 6 . In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins ( for example , α v β 3 ) exert both specific and redundant functions 7 – 15 ; however , how these distinct integrins accomplish their individual functions and whether these cooperate remains unclear . The signalling properties and functions of integrins are executed by specialized adhesive structures with distinct morphology , subcellular localization , lifespan and molecular composition . Nascent adhesions are short - lived adhesive structures in membrane protrusions 16 that promote the activity of Rho – GTPases such as Rac1 . Some nascent adhesions develop into large focal adhesions that initiate multiple signalling 1 Department of Molecular Medicine , Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , 82152 Martinsried , Germany . 2 Laboratoire de Physiologie Cellulaire et Végétale , Institut de Recherche en Technologies et Sciences pour le Vivant , CNRS / UJF / INRA / CEA , 17 Rue des Martyrs , 38054 Grenoble , France . 3 Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction , Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , 82152 Martinsried , Germany . 4 Institute for Informatics , Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München , 80333 Munich , Germany . 5 Institute of Experimental Physics , University of Ulm , 89069 Ulm , Germany . 6 These authors contributed equally to this work . 7 Correspondence should be addressed to R .

Myosin II exerts contractile forces resulting in adhesion reinforcement and recruitment of more proteins to focal adhesions , which induces a further increase in myosin II activity 17 . This feedback signalling to myosin II critically depends on biophysical parameters such as ECM stiffness . The identity of mechanosensor ( s ) in focal adhesions , whether it is an integrin , a focal adhesion protein or a combination of both , is unknown 18 . Quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) was previously used to determine the protein composition of adhesion structures ( adhesomes ) of cells seeded on fibronectin , and the dynamic changes on myosin - II - induced adhesion maturation 19 , 20 . As cells recruit different integrin classes to fibronectin - induced adhesions , these studies did not assign specific proteins and signalling outputs to particular integrins . Here we developed a cell system to investigate the protein composition and signalling properties of adhesion sites anchored selectively through α 5 β 1 and / or α v - class integrins . We found marked integrin - class - specific differences in the morphology of focal adhesions , intheirrequirementformechanicaltension , intheproteincomposition of their adhesomes and their signalling capacity .

RESULTS Differential functions of α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins in adhesion formation and cell migration To obtain cells expressing β 1 - and / or α v - class integrins we intercrossed mice carrying conditional null mutations for the α v and β 1 integrin genes and constitutive null mutations for the β 2 and β 7 integrin genes ( β f / f 1 , α f / f v , β − / − 2 , β − / − 7 mice ) 21 , isolated kidney fibroblasts and immortalized them with the SV40 large T antigen ( parental fibroblasts ) . Deletion of floxed α v and β 1 integrin genes by adenoviral Cre transduction removed all integrins from the parental fibroblast clones ( pan - knockouts , pKO ; Supplementary Fig . S1a – c ) . Next we transduced parental fibroblasts with α v or β 1 or both complementary DNAs and simultaneously transduced Cre to delete the floxed integrin alleles . This produced cells expressing α v ( pKO - α v ) , β 1 ( pKO - β 1 ) or α v and β 1 ( pKO - α v / β 1 ) integrins , respectively ( Fig . 1a ) . The pKO - α v , pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells were sorted for comparable integrin surface levels to the parental cell clones ( Supplementary Fig . S1d , e ) . Using western blotting , flow cytometry and MS we identified the following fibronectin - binding integrins ; α 5 β 1 in pKO - β 1 cells , α v β 3 and α v β 5 in pKO - α v cells , and α 5 β 1 , α v β 3 and α v β 5 in pKO - α v / β 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1f , g ) . Calibration of our flow cytometry analysis estimated the presence of 170 , 000 α 5 β 1 and 300 , 000 α v - class integrins on the surface of each cell , resulting in approximately equimolar surface levels for β 1 , β 3 and β 5 integrins . All three cell lines specifically adhered to fibronectin , whereas adhesion on vitronectin was similar for pKO - α v and pKO - α v / β 1 cells 626 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . A R T I C L E S and absent for pKO - β 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1h ) . To compare the size distribution of focal adhesions we seeded cells for 90min on fibronectin and immunostained for paxillin , integrin β 1 and β 3 ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . S2a , b ) . The percentage of small nascent adhesions ( < 2 µ m 2 ) was significantly elevated in pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells , whereas large focal adhesions of 6 – 12 µ m 2 dominated in pKO - α v cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2a , b ) . The cell spreading area on fibronectin was significantly lower in pKO - α v relative to pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells and reduced in pKO - α v / β 1 relative to pKO - β 1 ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . S1i ) . As cell shape and spreading area can affect cell contractility , focal adhesion size and distribution 22 , we seeded cells on circular fibronectin - coated micropatterns surrounded by non - adhesive polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , and confirmed the different adhesion size distribution in the three cell lines ( Fig . 1d , e ) . pKO - α v / β 1 cells contained both small nascent adhesions and large focal adhesions ( Fig . 1d ) . pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells showed increased protrusive activity when compared with pKO - α v cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2a , c ) , which correlated with increased migration speed . The mean square displacement ( MSD ) of cells migrating on fibronectin showed that pKO - β 1 cells migrated significantly faster than pKO - α v cells , and that pKO - α v / β 1 cells exhibited an intermediate migration speed ( Fig . 1f , g ) . As previously shown 13 , 23 , 24 , expression of α v - class integrins increased migration persistence ( Fig . 1h ) . pKO - β 1 cells exhibited a significant defect in trailing edge detachment ( Fig . 1i and Supplementary Fig . S2c and Videos S1 – S3 ) . These results identify a role for α 5 β 1 in protrusive activities and nascent adhesion formation , whereas co - expression of α v - class integrins also promotes the production of large , stable focal adhesions and trailing edge detachment in migrating cells . Differential functions of α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins synergize to regulate cell contractility Adhesion maturation and trailing edge retraction in migrating fibroblasts requires coordinated control of myosin - II - mediated cell contractility 25 . We measured myosin II activity using fibronectin - coated X - or crossbow - shaped micropatterns , which report subtle changes in myosin II activity and traction forces along non - adhesive edges 26 – 28 . Parental fibroblasts cultured on X - shaped fibronectin - coated micropatterns showed a dose - dependent decrease of phosphoT18 / S19 - myosin light chain ( pMLC ) , paxillin fluorescence intensities and cell area following treatment with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin ( Supplementary Fig . S2d – g ) . Crossbow patterns polarize cells into a low contractile front and a highly contractile rear 28 . Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that pMLC and paxillin intensities were the highest in pKO - α v / β 1 , lower in pKO - β 1 and the lowest in pKO - α v cells ( Fig . 2a ) . Myosin II activity was low in the cell front ( Fig . 2b ) and high in the cell rear ( Fig . 2c ) and the cooperative effect of the two integrin classes on pMLC and paxillin intensities in pKO - α v / β 1 was most prominent in the cell rear ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Treatment with the α v - class - specific small - molecule inhibitor cilengitide reduced contractility of pKO - α v / β 1 cells to intermediate levels ( Fig . 2b , c ) , confirming that the adhesive function of α v - class integrins is required for the synergy with α 5 β 1 . We corroborated these results with fibronectin - coated X - shapes , revealing phenotypes that resembled the rear of crossbow shapes ( Supplementary Fig . S2h – j ) . The ability to form large focal adhesions and stress fibres indicative of high contractile forces together with low pMLC levels in pKO - α v cells was surprising . Traction - force microscopy experiments on polyacrylamide gels of 35kPa stiffness revealed good correlation of traction forces and pMLC levels , confirming that traction forces on fibronectin - coated crossbow micropatterns are the lowest in pKO - α v , the highest in pKO - α v / β 1 and intermediate in pKO - β 1 cells ( Fig . 2d ) . Along the cell front , traction forces were significantly higher in pKO - β 1 cells when compared with pKO - α v cells and the highest in pKO - α v / β 1 ( Fig . 2e ) . Similar differences were observed by calculating the total contractile energy of individual cells ( Fig . 2f ) . α v - class integrins accumulate in areas of high traction force and mediate rigidity sensing α v β 3 integrins are known to become immobilized in large and static focal adhesions , whereas α 5 β 1 integrins are mobile , separate from the α v β 3 integrins and translocate rearward to fibrillar adhesions 10 , 29 . To investigate whether α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins segregate owing to differential dependence on myosin - II - mediated tension at focal adhesions we seeded pKO - α v / β 1 and parental floxed cells on fibronectin - coated crossbow shapes and immunostained β 1 and β 3 integrins . Indeed , β 3 heavily accumulated in areas that were shown to be exposed to the highest traction forces , whereas β 1 levels remained very low at these sites ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The β 3 integrins in contractile focal adhesions at the cell rear were lost following blebbistatin treatment , whereas small β 1 - containing focal adhesions in the cell periphery were still forming ( Fig . 3a ) . To confirm these findings we plated pKO - α v / β 1 cells on 1 - µ m - thin fibronectin - coated lines separated by 3 - µ m - wide non - adhesive PEG lines . This set - up allows distinguishing ligand - bound from unbound integrins , which is impossible on uniformly coated fibronectin surfaces . Whereas the β 1 integrin staining co - localized with fibronectin lines almost throughout the entire cell length , small β 3 clusters overlaid with lines in the cell periphery associated with F - actin bundles . Blebbistatin treatment or inhibition of Rock with Y - 27632 disassembled the β 3 integrin clusters on fibronectin lines , whereas β 1 remained unchanged ( Fig . 3c ) . The differential dependence of α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins on myosin - II - mediated tension at focal adhesions suggested that tension - dependent stabilization of α v - class integrins contributes to rigidity sensing . In line with this hypothesis , traction - force measurements of pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells plated on micropatterned polyacrylamide gels of 3 different rigidities ( 1 . 4 , 10 and 35kPa ) revealed that only pKO - α v / β 1 , but not pKO - β 1 , cells were able to increase contractile energies concomitantly with the substrate rigidity . Most notably , the traction forces and contractile energies generated by pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells were similar on soft , 1 . 4kPa substrates , whereas they differed significantly on stiffer substrates ( Fig . 3d , e ) . We therefore conclude that stabilization of α v β 3 – fibronectin bonds through actomyosin - mediated tension is requiredtoadjustcellcontractilitytodefinedsubstratestiffnesses . Adhesome composition and stoichiometry is controlled by the integrin class and myosin II activity Cells sense their environment through integrins and numerous plaque proteins in focal adhesions 17 , 30 . The composition and stoichiometry of the adhesome in fibronectin - bound fibroblasts is controlled by myosin II ( refs 19 , 20 ) . We therefore reasoned that specific binding activities of the integrin cytoplasmic tails and also the differential myosin II activities in pKO - α v , pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2013 627 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

To test this hypothesis we determined the integrin - class - specific protein composition of focal adhesions . The three cell lines were plated for 45 or 90min on fibronectin or poly - l - lysine ( PLL ; permits integrin - independent adhesion ) followed by chemical crosslinking and purification of focal adhesions , sample elution and quantitative MS as described previously 19 ( Supplementary Fig . S4a and Table S1 ) . Isolated adhesome proteins were quantified using the label - free quantification algorithm of the MaxQuant software 31 . We calculated median MS intensities of 3 – 4 replicates and performed hierarchical clustering to compare the three cell lines at different time points with and without blebbistatin . This approach allowed identifying protein groups with high correlation of their intensity changes across different substrates , time points and cell lines . We identified a cluster containing 168 proteins significantly enriched for known ( previously annotated ) focal adhesion proteins . In addition to the 168 proteins , we also considered all previously annotated focal adhesion proteins 32 assigned to other clusters in our analysis .

All rights reserved . A R T I C L E S the protein recruitment to focal adhesions in blebbistatin - treated pKO - α v / β 1 cells was mediated by α 5 β 1 ( Fig . 4a ) . A paired Student’s t - test for 58 known focal adhesion proteins confirmed a significant reduction of crosslinked focal adhesion proteins in pKO - α v cells by blebbistatin ( Fig . 4b ) . Furthermore , comparing the 45 and 90 min time points re - vealed that protein recruitment to focal adhesions was delayed in pKO - α v cells ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Importantly , blebbistatin did not change the MS in - tensities of α v - class integrins , excluding inefficient integrin crosslinking as the cause for the diminished recruitment of focal adhesion proteins , and indicating that short - lived / weak α v - class integrin – fibronectin interactions occur in the absence of cell contractility and can be crosslinked . These findings together with those depicted in Fig . 3 indicate that α 5 β 1 can cluster and induce adhesome assemblies in the absence of myosin - II - mediated tension , whereas the ability of α v - class integrinstoclusterandrecruitadhesomeproteinsdependsonmyosinII activationand / or thestress fibrearchitectureat focaladhesions . ILK and GEF - H1 are required for myosin II reinforcement on stiff substrates Consulting published protein – protein interactions within the adhesome 30 , we established a putative core interactome of fibronectin - bound α 5 β 1 or α v - class integrins ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Hierarchical cluster analysis of MS intensities of the 125 core proteins of the integrin interactome from all conditions tested ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) revealed 29 proteins correlating with MS intensities of α 5 β 1 at both time points and 2 proteins correlating with MS intensities of α v - class integrins ( Fig . 4c ) . In addition to this integrin interactome , we analysed the MS intensities of all actin - binding proteins in the focal - adhesion - enriched fraction and found that WAVE and Arp2 / 3 complexes , which drive lamellipodia formation , correlated with α 5 β 1 , whereas the RhoA effector mDia1 ( Diap1 ) , which drives stress - fibre formation , correlated with α v - class integrins ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . We performed stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) - based peptide pulldown assays with β 1 and β 3 integrin tail peptides and scrambled control peptides followed by MS ( ref . 33 ) to identify which of the 29 α 5 β 1 - enriched and 2 α v - class integrin - enriched adhesome proteins were enriched through differential associations with integrin cytoplasmic tails . Comparison of integrin - tail interactors with scrambled peptide interactors identified common and specific β 1 tail - and β 3 tail - binding proteins ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . Talin - 1 showed equal binding to β 1 and β 3 tails and was therefore used to control the experiments . In line with the adhesome analysis ( Fig . 4c ) we observed very high β 1 - tail - specific enrichment for Kindlin - 2 and a lowerenrichmentfortheILK / PINCH / Parvin ( IPP ) complex , andahigh β 3 - tail - specific enrichment of the RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF - H1 ( Fig . 4d ) . Thus , the recruitment of Kindlin - 2 , the IPP complex and GEF - H1 to focal adhesions is controlled by the integrin tail sequence rather than the different focal adhesion architecture in pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v cells . Ratiometric analysis of fluorescence intensities in focal adhesions confirmed higher Kindlin - 2 and ILK levels in pKO - β 1 cells and pKO - α v / β 1 cells ( Fig . 5a – d ) . To analyse GEF - H1 levels in focal adhesions we first chemically crosslinked and unroofed the cells to remove the large cytoplasmic and microtubule - associated GEF - H1 pool , and then performed immunostainings , which revealed that crosslinked GEF - H1 levels were significantly higher in pKO - α v and pKO - α v / β 1 cells than in pKO - β 1 cells ( Fig . 5e – g ) . To investigate whether the IPP complex and GEF - H1 contribute to myosin II regulation by α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins we seeded ILK fl / fl ( control ) and ILK − / − fibroblasts 34 on fibronectin - coated X - shapes and stained for pMLC . ILK − / − fibroblasts had similarly low pMLC signals as pKO - α v cells ( Fig . 5h , i ) . Furthermore , inhibition of α 5 β 1 with blocking antibodies or α v - class integrins with cilengitide in ILK fl / fl cells significantly reduced pMLC levels ( Fig . 5h , i ) , confirming that both fibronectin - binding integrin classes are required to activate myosin II . To examine whether GEF - H1 regulates integrin - mediated activation of myosin II on fibronectin - coated X - shapes we depleted GEF - H1 messengerRNAusingshortinterferingRNA ( siRNA ; Fig . 5j ) andfound significantlyreducedpMLClevelsinGEF - H1 - silencedpKO - α v / β 1 cells , slightly reduced levels in pKO - β 1 cells and unaffected levels in pKO - α v cells ( Fig . 5k , l ) indicating that GEF - H1 reinforces myosin II activity in a α 5 β 1 - dependent manner . The IPP complex and GEF - H1 have been implicated in cell contractility regulation by tuning RhoA GTPases 35 – 37 . Therefore , we investigated whether the activity of RhoA and Rac1 are affected in our celllines . Seedingthethreecelllinesfor45 minonfibronectininduceda significantly higher RhoA activity in pKO - α v cells when compared with pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 cells ( Fig . 5m ) . Rac1 activity was the lowest in pKO - α v cells , higher in pKO - β 1 and the highest in pKO - α v / β 1 cells ( Fig . 5n ) .

Integrin - speciﬁc signalling pathways cooperate for feedback regulation of myosin II The coupling of active RhoA to its effector Rock requires unknown signalling events that depend on cell adhesion , cell shape and cytoskeletal tension 22 . To uncover integrin - specific regulators of myosin II upstream and downstream of active RhoA we performed SILAC - based quantitative phosphoproteomics of adhesion signalling on fibronectin . We quantified a total of 3 , 180 proteins ( Supplementary Table S2 ) and 7 , 529 phosphorylation sites ( Supplementary Table S3 ) in the three cell lines seeded for 45min on fibronectin . ANOVA tests of triplicate experiments identified 150 proteins and 1 , 010 phosphorylation events as significantly regulated in at least one of the three cell lines ( Fig . 6a and Supplementary Fig . S9 , Tables S2 and S3 ) . Hierarchical cluster analysis of the SILAC ratios of the 1 , 010 phosphorylation events revealed clusters dominated by α 5 β 1 and clusters dominated by α v - class integrins . We also observed clusters regulated oppositely by α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins , indicating antagonistic regulation , and clusters regulated by both integrin classes , indicating synergistic regulation . Using ratio thresholds for the different pairwise comparisons allowed assignment of 646 of the 1 , 010 determined phospho - sites into either the antagonistic , dominant or synergistic category ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Table S4 ) . We searched for phospho - sites that influence myosin II activity in an integrin - dependent manner and found that pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v β 1 cells showed increased phosphorylation of the RhoA / Rock targets S693 - myosin phosphatase - 1 ( Mypt1 ; Fig . 6c – e ) and S3 - cofilin ( Fig . 6c – e ) . MLC phosphorylation can also be induced by Mlck , whose activity is controlled by Ca 2 + or Erk2 in focal adhesions 38 , 39 . We observed synergistic downregulation of S364 - Mlck and synergistic NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2013 631 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

Overexpression of ca - MEK1 rescued the low pErk2 levels and significantly increased pMLC in pKO - α v cells ( Fig . 7a – c ) . The high RhoA and low Rock and pMLC activities in pKO - α v cells ( Figs 5 and 6 ) suggest that α v - class integrins are unable to couple active RhoA to Rock , which was tested by overexpressing ca - RhoA or ca - Rock in the three cell lines . Whereas ca - RhoA significantly increased pMLC in pKO - β 1 and pKO - α v / β 1 , pMLC levels remained unchanged in pKO - α v cells . In sharp contrast , ca - Rock increased pMLC twofold in all three cell lines ( Fig . 7d , e ) , indicating that endogenous Rock in pKO - α v cells remained inactive even in the presence of high RhoA – GTP . This finding was further confirmed with pMLCstainingofcellsseededonfibronectin - coatedXshapes ( Fig . 7f , g ) . In conclusion , the Mek1 / Erk2 and the RhoA / Rock / pMLC pathways are preferentially induced by α 5 β 1 , whereas the high RhoA activity induced in pKO - α v cells is not coupled to Rock / pMLC . DISCUSSION We reconstituted pan - integrin - deficient fibroblasts with β 1 - and / or α v - class integrins and correlated integrin - class - specific cellular pheno - types with integrin - class - specific adhesome composition and signalling events . Fibroblasts exploring fibronectin - based microenvironments en - gage α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins to orchestrate membrane protrusions , cell contractility and cell migration . Our cell line analyses revealed a se - ries of signalling events accomplished by α 5 β 1 integrins , which activate Rac1 , induce membrane protrusions , assemble nascent adhesions and generate RhoA / Rock - mediated myosin II activity . In conjunction with these events , mechanosensitive α v - class integrins accumulate in areas subjected to high tension and reinforce adhesive sites to induce further activation of myosin II and development of large focal adhesions and actomyosin bundles ( Fig . 8 ) . Our study uncovers a sequence of tightly integrated biophysical and biochemical events induced by α 5 β 1 and 634 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The protein assembly in α 5 β 1 - containing adhesions activates Rac1 , Wave and Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization to induce membrane protrusions , and RhoA / Rock - mediated myosin II activation to induce tension . This tension increases the adhesion lifetime of α v - class integrins bound to ligand on stiff substrates , which reinforces and stabilizes focal adhesions . α v - class integrins recruit GEF - H1 to focal adhesions , which reinforces RhoA / myosin II in a α 5 β 1 - dependent manner , and increases RhoA activity to promote mDia - mediated stress ﬁbre formation . The combination of α v - class integrin - mediated structure ( focal - adhesion anchoring and stress - ﬁbre formation ) with the α 5 β 1 - mediated force generation ( myosin II activity ) constitutes a synergistic system , which is important for adapting cellular contractility and architecture to the rigidity of ﬁbronectin - based microenvironments . α v - class integrins that adjust fibroblast contractility to the rigidity of fibronectin - coated substrates . The cooperation of α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins to sense the rigidity of fibronectin - based microenvironments predicts that cell migration towards a rigidity gradient , called durotaxis , may also depend on the cooperation of both integrins . These findings have potential ramifications for certain pathologies , such as fibrosis and tumour metastasis where rigidity sensing of fibronectin matrices is crucial in disease progression 40 . To better understand how distinct integrin classes individually and cooperatively probe the biophysical properties of a fibronectin - based microenvironment , we established a cell model system and used proteomics methods to characterize their focal adhesion composition , phospho - signalling and proteome changes . Our comprehensive proteomic data set of adhesion signalling revealed that integrin - class - specific adhesomes and phospho - proteomes are enriched with integrin - specific adapter proteins and signalling intermediates . Several well - known integrin outside - in signalling pathways , including the Rac1 / Wave / Arp2 , 3 and RhoA / Rock pathways , were dominated by α 5 β 1 integrins . Interestingly , the pKO - β 1 cells developed very few stress fibres , indicating that α 5 β 1 - induced RhoA activity was preferably used for production of myosin - II - mediated force but not formin - mediated stress - fibre formation . In contrast , the pKO - α v cells exhibited high RhoA activity , which in turn induced the formation of thick stress fibres , most likely through the activation of mDia , but did not activate Rock / pMLC / myosin II . The coupling of active RhoA to different downstreameffectorsbydistinctintegrinclasseswasunanticipated . The underlying mechanism ( s ) are unclear , but probably involve specific mark ( s ) either attached to active RhoA or to the effectors enabling differential interactions with GTP - bound RhoA . Although forces play an important role in the assembly of focal adhesions , pKO - α v cells induced the largest focal adhesions among the three cell lines and also exhibited the lowest myosin II activities and traction forces . Focal adhesion size is not the sole predictor of traction forces and the final focal adhesion size can also be determined by an mDia - dependent mechanism 41 , 42 . Therefore , we propose that the large sizeoffocaladhesionsinpKO - α v cellsdependsonRhoA / mDia - induced stress fibres rather than on myosin II . However , although the final focal adhesion size in pKO - α v cells was myosin - II - independent , their formation and / or stability were strictly myosin - II - dependent , evidenced by the pronounced destabilization of α v - class integrin adhesions with blebbistatin . A role for α v - class integrins for focal adhesion stabilization has also been obtained from single - protein tracking experiments of β 1 and β 3 integrins , which showed that β 3 integrins are immobilized in large focal adhesions , whereas β 1 integrins are more mobile 29 . The necessity of α v β 3 for cell stiffening following force application has also been postulated 43 . Similarly , the recruitment of GEF - H1 to focal adhesions and Erk2 activity was reported as necessary for cell stiffening following force application 35 . Our results link these observations and suggest that force - mediated stabilization of α v – fibronectin bonds will reinforce focal adhesions , increase local concentrations of GEF - H1 and activate RhoA following α 5 β 1 - induced Erk2 activation . Therefore , α v - class integrins could be capable of forming stronger extracellular catch bonds with fibronectin than α 5 β 1 integrins do 44 , resulting in longer bond lifetimes of α v - class integrins with fibronectin when force is applied . However , as the influence of force on the on and off rates of α 5 β 1 and α v - class integrins with fibronectin have not been systematically studied , this hypothesis awaits future testing .

Isolation , immortalization , viral reconstitution and transfection of cell lines . Mouse pKO fibroblasts and reconstituted pKO - α v , pKO - β 1 and pKO α v / β 1 cell lines were generated from fibroblasts ( floxed parental ) derived from the kidney of 21 - day - old male mice carrying floxed α v and β 1 alleles ( α flox / flox v , β flox / flox 1 ) , and constitutive β 2 and β 7 null alleles ( β − / − 2 , β − / − 7 ; ref . 21 ) . Individual kidney fibroblast clones were immortalized by retroviral delivery of the SV40 large T . The immortalized floxed fibroblast clones were then retrovirally transduced with mouse α v and / or β 1 integrin cDNAs and the endogenous floxed β 1 and α v integrin loci were simultaneously deleted by adenoviral transduction of the Cre recombinase . Reconstituted cell lines were FACS sorted to obtain cell populations with comparable integrin surface levels to the parental cell clones . Transduction of ca - RhoA ( myc – RhoA pcDNA3 . 1 ) and ca - ROCK ( myc – ROCKD4 pcDNA3 . 1 ) was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen through Life Technologies ) accordingtothemanufacturer’sinstructions . Thetransfectioncontrolwasanempty pcDNA3 . 1 vector . Adhesion and cell migration analysis . Adhesion assays were carried out as previously described 45 . Briefly , cells were plated for 20min in 96 - well plates coated withvaryingconcentrationsofECMligands . Afterwashingtheplatesthenumberof adhered cells that remained on the plate was quantified using attenuance at 595nm . To analyse random migration , cell culture dishes were coated with fibronectin ( 5 µ gml − 1 inPBS ; 2hatroomtemperature ) andblockedwith1 % BSAinPBS . After seeding , video time - lapse microscopy was performed using phase contrast at × 20 magnification . A total of 12 migrating pKO - α v , 12 migrating pKO - α v / β 1 and 14 migratingpKO - β 1 cellsfrom5independentmovieswereanalysed . Onepixelineach cell nucleus was marked manually and served as the cell’s coordinate . Each tracked cell j with a track length N j was recorded by its x j , i and yj , i position for every frame i . A tracking point was made every D t = 1 min . The time difference between the tracking coordinates x j , i and x j , i + n is t = nD t , where n is the frame number . The mean squared displacement ( msd ) of the cell j at time t = nD t was calculated by msd j ( t ) = 1 N j − n N j − n (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:104)(cid:0) x j , i + n − x j , i (cid:1) 2 + (cid:0) y j , i + n − y j , i (cid:1) 2 (cid:105) All msd values were calculated for all cells and averaged . The used propagated uncertainty for the msd ( t ) is the standard deviation of the mean . For an increasing n the number of given tracks contributes to msd ( t ) decreases as well as the propagated uncertainty caused by the tracking uncertainty increases . Therefore , the msd ( t ) has been cut at n = 90 . To determine the persistence time P and the diffusion constant D , Fürths formula msd ( t ) = 4 D (cid:18) t − P (cid:18) 1 − exp (cid:18) − t P (cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:19) has been fitted through the data . The mean velocity of a cell j has been computed as the average of the distance travelled each time step divided by the time step . Micropatterningandimmunostainings . MicropatternsweregeneratedonPEG - coated glass coverslips with deep - ultraviolet lithography 46 . Glass coverslips were in - cubated in a 1mM solution of a linear PEG , CH 3 – ( O – CH 2 – CH 2 ) 43 – NH – CO – NH – CH 2 – CH 2 – CH 2 – Si ( OEt ) 3 in dry toluene for 20h at 80 ◦ C under a nitrogen at - mosphere . The substrates were removed , rinsed intensively with ethyl acetate , methanol and water , and dried with nitrogen . A pegylated glass coverslip and a chromium - coatedquartzphotomask ( ML & C , Jena ) wereimmobilizedwithvacuum onto a mask holder , which was immediately exposed to deep ultraviolet light using a low - pressure mercury lamp ( NIQ 60 / 35 XL longlife lamp , quartz tube , 60W from Heraeus Noblelight ) at 5cm distance for 7min . The patterned substrates were subsequently incubated overnight with 100 µ l of fibronectin ( 20 µ gml − 1 in PBS ) at 4 ◦ C and washed once with PBS . For immunofluorescence microscopy , cells were seeded on micropatterns in DMEM ( GIBCO by Life Technologies ) containing 0 . 5 % FBS at 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 . After 90 or 180min the medium was soaked off , and cells were fixed with 3 % PFA in PBS for 5min at room temperature , washed with PBS , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 1h at room temperature and then incubated with antibodies . The fluorescent images were collected with a laser scanning confocal microscope ( Leica SP5 ) . Acrylamide micropatterning . Micropatterns were first produced on glass coverslips as previously described 46 . Briefly , 20mm square glass coverslips were oxidized through oxygen plasma ( FEMTO , Diener Electronics ) for 10s at 30W before incubating with 0 . 1mgml − 1 poly - l - lysine ( PLL ) – PEG ( PLL20K - G35 - PEG2K , JenKem ) in 10mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , for 30min . After drying , coverslips were exposed to 165nm ultraviolet ( UVO cleaner , Jelight ) through a photomask ( Toppan ) for5min . Then , coverslipswereincubatedwith20mgml − 1 offibronectin ( Sigma ) and 2mgml − 1 of rhodamine - labelled fibronectin ( Cytoskeleton ) in 100mM sodium bicarbonate solution for 30min . Acrylamide solution containing acrylamideandbisacrylamide ( Sigma ) wasdegassedfor20minunderhousevacuum and mixed with passivated fluorescent beads ( Invitrogen ) by sonication before addition of APS and TEMED . A 25 µ l drop of this solution was put directly on the micropatterned glass coverslip . A silanized coverslip was placed over the drop and left polymerizing for 30min ( fluorescent beads passivation and glass silanization were performed as previously described 4 ) . The sandwich was then put in 100mM sodium bicarbonate solution and the gel was gently removed from the patterned glass coverslip while staying attached to the other coverslip owing to the silanization treatment . This process transferred the protein micropatterns onto the gel as previously described 47 . Three different solutions of 3 % / 0 . 225 % , 5 % / 0 . 225 % , 8 % / 0 . 264 % acrylamide / bisacrylamide were used . The corresponding Young’smodulusofthegelswas1 . 4 , 9 . 6and34 . 8kParespectivelyasmeasuredusing AFM . Coverslips were mounted in magnetic chambers ( Cytoo ) and washed with sterile PBS before plating cells . AFM measurements of the Young’s modulus of acrylamide gels . We measured gel stiffness through nanoindentation using an atomic force microscope ( Bruker Nanoscope ) mounted with silica - bead - tipped cantilevers ( r ( bead ) = 2 . 5 µ m , nominal spring constant 0 . 06Nm − 1 , Novascan Technologies ) . Initially , we determined the sensitivity of the photodiode to cantilever deflection by measuring theslopeofaforcedistancecurvewhenpressingthecantileverontoaglasscoverslip , and the force constant of the cantilever using the thermal noise method included in the Bruker Nanoscope software . For each acrylamide / bisacrylamide ratio used in the traction - force microscopy measurements we acquired 27 force curves in 3 by 3 grids ( 2 µ m spacing between points ) at three different locations on the gels . BeforeandduringindentationexperimentsgelswerekeptinPBS . Toobtainstiffness values from force curves we used the NanoScope Analysis software . Specifically , we correctedforbaselinetilt , andusedthelinearfittingoptionfortheHertzmodelwith a Poisson ration of 0 . 48 on the indentation curve . Traction - force microscopy and image analysis . Confocal acquisition was performed on an Eclipse TI - E Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a CSUX1 - A1 Yokogawa confocal head and an Evolve EMCCD camera ( Ropert Scientific , PrincetonInstrument ) . ACFIPlanAPOVCoil × 60 / 1 . 4objective ( Nikon ) wasused . The system was driven by the Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . Traction - force microscopy was performed as previously described 28 . Displace - ment fields describing the deformation of the polyacrylamide substrate are deter - mined from the analysis of fluorescent bead images before and after removal of the adhering cell with trypsin treatment . Images of fluorescent beads were first aligned to correct experimental drift using the Align slices in stack ImageJ plugin . The displacement field was subsequently calculated by a custom - written particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) program implemented as an ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) plugin . The PIV was performed through an iterative scheme . In all iterations the displacement was calculated by the normalized correlation coefficient algorithm , so that an individual interrogation window was compared with a larger searching window . The next iteration takes into account the displacement field measured previously , so that a false correlation peak due to insufficient image features is avoided . The normalized cross - correlation also allowed us to define an arbitrary threshold to filter out low correlation values due to insufficient beads present in the window . The resulting final grid size for the displacement field was 2 . 67 × 2 . 67 µ m . Theerroneousdisplacementvectorsduetoinsufficientbeadspresentinthewindowwerefilteredoutbytheirlowcorrelationvalueandreplacedbythemedianvaluefromtheneighbouringvectors . With the displacement field obtained from the PIV analysis , the traction - force field was reconstructed by the Fourier transform traction cytometry ( FTTC ) method with regularized scheme on the same grid ( 2 . 67 × 2 . 67 µ m ) without further interpolation or remapping . The regularization parameter was set at 1 × 10 – 11 for all traction - force reconstructions . The Fourier transform traction cytometry code was also written in Java as an ImageJ plugin , so that the whole traction - force microscopy procedure from PIV to force calculation could be performed with ImageJ .

Cells were transiently transfected with a final concentration of 300nM siRNA ( stealth RNAi ; Invitrogen ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol , using the targeting sequence sense - 5 (cid:48) - CCCGGAACUUUGUCAUCCAUCGUUU - 3 (cid:48) forGEF - H1 . Asacontrolweusedthe scrambled sequence sense - 5 (cid:48) - CCCUCAAUGUUCUACCUACGGGUUU - 3 (cid:48) . MS . For proteome and phosphoproteome analysis fibroblasts were cultured in lysine / arginine - free DMEM with 10 % FBS ( 10KDa dialysed , PAA ) and SILAC labelled with light ( l - arginine ( R0 ) and l - lysine ( K0 ) ) ] , medium ( L - arginine - U - 13 C 6 ( R6 ) and l - lysine - 2 H 4 ( K4 ) ) or heavy ( l - arginine - U - 13 C 6 − 15 N 4 ( R10 ) and l - lysine - U - 13 C 6 − 15 N 2 ( K8 ) ) amino acids ( Cambridge Isotope Laboratories ) . For phosphoproteome analysis , cells were serum - starved for 6h and then plated in serum - free medium on fibronectin - coated and BSA - blocked culture dishes for 45min . Cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 100mM Tris – HCl , at pH7 . 5 , containing 4 % SDS and 100mM dithiothreitol ) , boiled 5min at 95 ◦ C , and sonicated . Lysate was clarified by a 10min centrifugation at 16 , 000 g . Cleared light / medium / heavy proteins were mixed at a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio and digested with trypsin using the FASP protocol 48 . For proteome analysis , 40 µ g of peptides was separated with strong anion exchange chromatography 49 . For phosphoproteome analysis , 3mg of peptides was fractionated with strong cation exchange chromatography and enriched for phosphorylated peptides with titanium dioxide ( TiO 2 ) as described previously 50 . PeptideswerethenanalysedonaLTQ - OrbitrapVelosequippedwitha nanoelectrospray source ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The full - scan MS spectra were acquiredintheOrbitrapwitharesolutionof30 , 000at m / z 400 . Thetenmostintense ionswerefragmentedbyhigher - energycollisionaldissociationandthespectraofthe fragmented ions were acquired in the Orbitrap analyser with a resolution of 7 , 500 . PeptideswereidentifiedandquantifiedusingtheMaxQuantsoftware 31 andsearched with the Andromeda search engine against the mouse IPI database 3 . 68 ( ref . 51 ) . Phosphorylations were assigned as previously described 50 . The adhesome analysis was performed as previously described 19 . In brief , cells wereserum - starvedfor4handplatedforeither45or90mininserum - freemedium on fibronectin - coated , BSA - blocked , culture dishes . Optionally , cells were treated with 50 µ M blebbistatin for 30 or 75min . Enrichment for focal - adhesion - associated proteins was achieved by shortly fixing the ventral cell cortex using chemical crosslinkers , followed by removal of non - crosslinked proteins and big organelles by stringent cell lysis and hydrodynamic sheer flow washing . Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Electron ) and analysed using the label - free quantification algorithm 52 , which is embedded in the MaxQuant software 31 , as previously described 19 . For in - gel digestion , gel bands were cut into 1mm 3 cubes and washed two times with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50 % ethanol . For protein reduction , gel pieceswereincubatedwith10mMdithiothreitolin50mMammoniumbicarbonatefor1hat56 ◦ C . Alkylation of cysteines was performed with 10mM iodoacetamide in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate for 45min at 25 ◦ C in the dark . Gel pieces were washed two times with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50 % ethanol , dehydrated with 100 % ethanol , and dried in a vacuum concentrator . The gel pieces were rehydrated with 12 . 5ng µ l − 1 trypsin ( sequencing grade , Promega ) in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested overnight at 37 ◦ C . Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes , and the remaining peptides were extracted by incubating gel pieces two times with 30 % acetonitrile in 3 % TFA followed by dehydrationwith100 % acetonitrile . Theextractswerecombinedanddesaltedusing RP - C18 StageTip columns , and the eluted peptides used for mass spectrometric analysis . For nanoLC – MS / MS , peptide mixtures were separated by on - line nanoLC and analysedbyelectrospraytandemMS . TheexperimentswereperformedonanAgilent 1200 nanoflow system connected to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Electron ) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source ( Proxeon Biosystems ) . Binding and chromatographic separation of the peptides took place in a 15 - cm fused - silica emitter ( 75 - µ m inner diameter from Proxeon Biosystems ) in - house packed with reversed - phase ReproSil - Pur C18 - AQ 3 µ m resin ( Dr . Maisch ) . Peptide mixtures were injected onto the column with a flow of 500nlmin − 1 and subsequently eluted with a flow of 2500nlmin − 1 from 2 % to 40 % acetonitrile in 0 . 5 % acetic acid , in a 100min gradient . The precursor ion spectra were acquired in theOrbitrapanalyser ( m / z 300 – 1 , 800 , R = 60 , 000 , andionaccumulationtoatarget value of 1 , 000 , 000 ) , and the ten most intense ions were fragmented and recorded in the ion trap . The lock mass option enabled accurate mass measurement in both MS and Orbitrap MS / MS mode as described previously 53 . Target ions already selected for MS / MS were dynamically excluded for 60s . For peptide identification and peptide quantification , the data analysis was performed with the MaxQuant software as described previously 31 , 54 , supported by Andromeda as the database search engine for peptide identifications . Peaks in MS scans were determined as three - dimensional hills in the mass - retention time plane . MS / MS peak lists were filtered to contain at most six peaks per 100Da interval and searched by Andromeda ( in - house - developed software ) against the Mouse International Protein Index database . The initial mass tolerance in MS mode was set to 7ppm and MS / MS mass tolerance was 0 . 5Da . Cysteine carbamidomethylation was searched as a fixed modification , whereas N - acetyl protein , oxidized methionine , N - carbamidomethylated DSP protein and carbamidomethylated DSP lysine were searched as variable modifications . Finally , the label - free quantification algorithm implemented in the MaxQuant software was used as described earlier 52 . SILAC - based peptide pulldowns were carried out with the cytoplasmic tails of β 1 integrin ( 5 (cid:48) - HDRREFAKFEKEKMNAKWDTGENPIYKSAVTTVVNPKYEGK - 3 (cid:48) ) and the tails of β 3 integrin ( 5 (cid:48) - HDRKEFAKFEEERARAKWDTANNPLYKEATS - TFTNITYRGT - 3 (cid:48) ) . The tail peptides were de novo synthesized with a desthiobiotin on the amino terminus , coupled to magnetic streptavidin beads ( MyOne Streptavidin C1 — Invitrogen ) and pulldowns from SILAC - labelled cell lysates were performed as described previously 33 . After a mild wash the bound proteins were eluted from the magnet using 16mM biotin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After protein precipitationandin - solutiondigestion , LC - MS / MSanddataanalysiswasperformed as described above . The peptide pulldown experiments were done as reverse SILAC labelling experiments in duplicate ( 4 biological replicates ) . We generally considered outliers with high SILAC ratios and high sequence coverage / intensity as more significant than proteins that had only a high SILAC ratio . Bioinformatics and statistics . ANOVA analysis of the cellular proteome and phosphoproteome was performed using the Perseus bioinformatics toolbox of MaxQuant ( J . Cox et al . ; manuscript in preparation ) . Multiple testing corrections were performed using the inbuilt permutation method and significant hits were identified at a significance level of 0 . 01 and 0 . 05 , respectively . ANOVA analysis of the 245 core adhesome proteins was performed using the statistical programming language R ( http : / / www . R - project . org ) with the adaptive Benjamini and Hochberg step - up false discovery rate - controlling procedure for multiple testing and a significance level of 0 . 05 . Hierarchical clustering was performed using an average linkage approach and Euclidean distances . Enrichment analysis of clusters for Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms , KEGG pathways and PFAM and INTERPRO protein domains was performed with the DAVID webserver 55 using the multiple testing correction method by Benjamini and Hochberg and a significance level of 0 . 05 . Protein – proteininteractions ( PPIs ) werecompiledfromdifferentsourcesincluding : PPI databases ( DIP ( ref . 56 ; version of December 2009 ) , IntAct ( ref . 57 ) and MINT ( ref . 58 ) ( both downloaded on 19 May 2010 ) , BIOGRID ( ref . 59 ; version 3 . 0 . 64 ) and HPRD ( ref . 60 ; Release 9 ) ) ; the adhesome network database 32 ; and the KEGG pathway database 61 . For the adhesome network database , we distinguished between undirected PPIs and directed activating and inhibiting interactions as annotated in the adhesome database and in KEGG . Human and mouse interactions were combined using the orthologue tables of the Mouse Genome Database ( MGI ) to increase coverage . The high - confidence network of PPIs from public databases contained only interactions reported in at least two separate publications . Networks were visualized using the Cytoscape software . Bar graphs throughout the study were generated in Microsoft Office and depict , unless otherwise indicated , the means and standard errors of the means . Box plots and dot plots were generated using the SigmaPlot software or the MatLab software . NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .
