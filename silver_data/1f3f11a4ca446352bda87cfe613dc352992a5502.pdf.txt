HIP - 55 Is Important for T - Cell Proliferation , Cytokine Production , and Immune Responses Jin Han , Jr - Wen Shui , Xuejun Zhang , Biao Zheng , Shuhua Han , and Tse - Hua Tan * Department of Immunology , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas 77030 Received 20 January 2005 / Returned for modiﬁcation 16 March 2005 / Accepted 16 May 2005 Engagement of the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) triggers a series of signaling events that lead to the activation of T cells . HIP - 55 ( SH3P7 or mAbp1 ) , an actin - binding adaptor protein , interacts with and is tyrosine phos - phorylated by ZAP - 70 , which is a crucial proximal protein tyrosine kinase for TCR signaling . HIP - 55 is important for JNK and HPK1 activation induced by TCR signaling . In this study , we report the generation and characterization of HIP - 55 knockout mice . We found that HIP - 55 knockout mice were viable and fertile but showed decreased body weight and increased occurrence of death within the ﬁrst 4 weeks after birth . The lymphoid organs in HIP - 55 knockout mice showed cellularity and T - cell development comparable to that of the wild - type mice . HIP - 55 knockout T cells displayed defective T - cell proliferation , decreased cytokine production , and decreased up - regulation of the activation markers induced by TCR stimulation . TCR internalization was slightly increased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . These phenotypes were accompanied by reduced immune responses , including antigen - speciﬁc antibody production and T - cell proliferation in HIP - 55 knockout mice . The TCR - induced signaling events , including LAT / phospholipase C (cid:1) 1 phosphorylation and HPK1 / JNK acti - vation , were partially defective in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . These results demonstrate the importance of HIP - 55 as an adaptor protein in the TCR signaling and immune system . The activation of T lymphocytes plays a central role in the regulation of immune responses . An optimal T - cell response requires signals delivered from the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) and coreceptors . Engagement of the TCR triggers the activation of Src family protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn , which subse - quently phosphorylate the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based ac - tivation motifs in the CD3 (cid:2) tail . The phosphorylated tyrosine - based activation motifs recruit ZAP - 70 through the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain of ZAP - 70 . The recruitment of ZAP - 70 to the TCR complex leads to the activation of ZAP - 70 by Lck . Upon activation , ZAP - 70 plays a major role in prop - agating the TCR signals to downstream molecules , including LAT , phospholipase C (cid:3) 1 ( PLC (cid:3) 1 ) , and SLP - 76 . LAT is local - ized in speciﬁc plasma membrane compartments known as glycolipid - enriched microdomains and serves as a docking pro - tein for other signaling molecules , including SLP - 76 and Grb2 . The LAT - associated adaptors then recruit various signaling molecules to the glycolipid - enriched microdomains and pro - mote multiple downstream signaling events , such as mitogen - activated protein kinase activation , the release of intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) , and increased interleukin - 2 production ( 1 , 2 , 16 , 19 , 21 , 28 ) . HIP - 55 ( hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 [ HPK1 ] - inter - acting protein of 55 kDa ; also called SH3P7 and mAbp1 ) is a novel SH3 domain - containing protein ( 11 ) . HIP - 55 contains an actin - binding domain at its N terminus and an SH3 domain at its C terminus ( 11 ) , and it binds to ﬁlamentous actin and colocalizes with actin ﬁlaments ( 17 , 20 ) . HIP - 55 also interacts with dynamin and Cdc42 , which is important for receptor - mediated endocytosis and Golgi transport ( 13 , 18 , 27 ) . HIP - 55 is cleaved during apoptosis ( 6 ) . HIP - 55 interacts with HPK1 ( 11 ) , a serine / threonine protein kinase involved in TCR sig - naling ( 15 , 23 , 24 ) . Upon TCR stimulation , HIP - 55 translo - cates to glycolipid - enriched microdomains ( 14 , 22 ) and binds to phosphorylated ZAP - 70 ( 14 ) . In HIP - 55 - knockdown Jurkat T cells established by RNA interference , the signaling events induced by TCR stimulation , such as HPK1 and JNK activa - tion , are defective ( 14 ) , suggesting that HIP - 55 may be an important regulator in TCR signaling . To study the in vivo functions of HIP - 55 in TCR signaling and the immune system , we generated and characterized HIP - 55 knockout mice . We found that HIP - 55 knockout mice showed decreased body weight and higher occurrence of death within the ﬁrst 4 weeks after birth . The cellularity of lymphoid organs and the development of T cells in HIP - 55 knockout mice were normal . However , HIP - 55 knockout T cells were less responsive to TCR stimulation , as manifested here by reduced T - cell proliferation , lower cytokine production , and decreased up - regulation of activation markers . Additionally , antigen - speciﬁc immune responses were also reduced in HIP - 55 knockout mice . The signaling events including LAT / PLC (cid:3) 1 phosphorylation and HPK1 / JNK activation induced by TCR stimulation were partially decreased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells , which may be responsible for the defects we observed in the immune system . These ﬁndings provide evidence that HIP - 55 is an important adaptor protein that regulates T - cell activation and immune responses . MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of HIP - 55 knockout mice . A mouse HIP - 55 knockout embryonic stem cell clone ( BayGenomics , Davis , CA ) was injected into C57BL / 6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice . The heterozygous HIP - 55 progeny from the crossing of the chimeras with C57BL / 6 mice were used to generate HIP - 55 knockout mice . The genotype was determined by Southern blotting and PCR . Mice used in this study were 6 to 10 weeks old with a mixed C57BL / 6 (cid:4) 129 / Ola genetic * Corresponding author .

Cells were cultured for 48 h and labeled with 1 (cid:7) Ci / well [ 3 H ] thymidine for 16 h . Thymidine incorporation was then measured with a scintillation counter . Cytokine production was measured using the kit from BD Biosciences . For T - cell stimulation , lymph node cells or puriﬁed T cells were incubated for 15 min at 4°C with 10 (cid:7) g / ml biotin - conjugated anti - CD3 ( 500A2 , Pharmingen ) , incubated for 10 min at 4°C with 10 (cid:7) g / ml streptavidin ( Sigma ) , and placed in a 37°C water bath for the indicated times . Jurkat T - cell stimulation using an anti - CD3 antibody ( OKT3 ) was performed as previously described ( 14 ) . Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting . Cells were lysed in ice - cold 1 % Triton X - 100 lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 2 mM EGTA , 50 mM glycerophosphate , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 ) freshly supplemented with 0 . 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 5 (cid:7) g / ml leu - peptin , and 3 (cid:7) g / ml aprotinin . The cell lysate was incubated with the indicated antibodies fo r 2 h orovernight and protein G - Sepharose beads fo r 1 h at4°C . The immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and then sub - jected to Western blot analysis . For Western blotting , immunocomplexes or cellular proteins ( 50 to 100 (cid:7) g ) were resolved by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) , and the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes at 4°C . Western blotting was performed as previously described using the indicated antibodies ( 14 ) . Immunocomplex kinase assays . JNK and HPK1 immunocomplex kinase as - says were performed as previously described ( 7 , 8 ) . Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – c - Jun and myelin basic protein were used as the substrate for the JNK and HPK1 kinase assays , respectively . Animal immunization . For in vivo T - cell activation , mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 4 - hydroxy - 3 - nitrophenylacetyl ( NP ) coupled to chicken (cid:3) globulin ( NP - CGG ) ( 5 (cid:7) g / g mouse weight ) emulsiﬁed in complete Freund’s adjuvant ( Sigma ) . Cells were prepared from the enlarged draining lymph nodes 7 days later and restimulated with different doses of NP - CGG . Cells were cultured for 64 h and then labeled with 1 (cid:7) Ci / well [ 3 H ] thy - midine for 16 h . Thymidine incorporation was then measured with a scintillation counter . For T - cell - mediated humoral immune responses , mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of alum - precipitated NP - CGG in phosphate - buffered saline ( 5 (cid:7) g / g mouse weight ) . Thirty - one days after the ﬁrst immunization , mice were reinjected with NP - CGG in phosphate - buffered saline ( 2 . 5 (cid:7) g / g mouse weight ) . Serum was collected at indicated times ( days 7 , 14 , 21 , and 30 after the ﬁrst immunization and day 5 after the second immunization ) . The titers of anti - NP - speciﬁc immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) and IgM in the serum were mea - sured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using NP - bovine serum albumin as the coating antigen , followed by incubation with anti - IgG1 and anti - IgM goat anti - mouse antibodies . Generation of HIP - 55 shRNA - knockdown Jurkat T cells . To generate HIP - 55 small - hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) , a 19 - nucleotide sequence ( GGTGCTGGCTCTG AGCACA ) selected from human HIP - 55 cDNA ( 1060 to 1078 ) was annealed and ligated into pSUPER vector ( 14 ) . HIP - 55 shRNA was stably transfected into Jurkat T cells , and HIP - 55 shRNA - knockdown Jurkat T cells were generated as described ( 14 ) . TCR internalization . For CD3 ε internalization , splenic T cells were mixed with biotin - anti - CD3 ε ( 10 (cid:7) g / ml ) on ice for 30 min , and then the cells were either stopped with 0 . 1 % NaN 3 or incubated in 37°C for 2 h . Then the internalization was stopped with 0 . 1 % NaN 3 and the cells were stained with Tricolor - streptavi - din and anti - CD4 - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate . For TCR (cid:6) internalization , splenic T cells were treated with prebound anti - CD3 ε ( 10 (cid:7) g / ml ) for 0 , 2 , and 4 h , then the internalization was stopped with 0 . 1 % NaN 3 and the cells were stained with anti - CD4 - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate and anti - TCR (cid:6) - phycoerythrin . Antibodies . The anti - HIP - 55 ( N terminus , Ab571 ) and anti - JNK antibodies were previously described ( 14 ) . The anti - HIP - 55 ( C terminus , amino acids 406 to 436 ) was a generous gift from M . Stamnes ( University of Iowa , Iowa City , IA ) . The anti - HPK1 ( Ab870 ) antibody was generated against a peptide corresponding to mouse HPK1 amino acids 473 to 490 . The anti - CD4 - ﬂuorescein isothiocya - nate , anti - CD8 - phycoerythrin , anti - CD3 - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate , anti - B220 - phycoerythrin , anti - TCR - (cid:6) , anti - CD3 ε - biotin , anti - CD44 - phycoerythrin , anti - CD25 - biotin , and anti - CD69 - phycoerythrin were purchased from BD Biosciences ( San Diego , CA ) .

RESULTS Generation of HIP - 55 knockout mice . To study the functions of HIP - 55 in TCR signaling , we generated HIP - 55 knockout mice using a gene - trapping strategy . An insertion vector con - taining (cid:6) - geo ( a fusion between the (cid:6) - galactosidase and neo - mycin phosphotransferase genes ) , human placental alkaline phosphatase , and an internal ribosome entry site was inserted in the intron between exons 8 and 9 of the targeted Hip - 55 allele ( Fig . 1A ) . After the insertion , a fusion transcript was generated through splicing of the region from exons 1 to 8 of the Hip - 55 gene to (cid:6) - geo ( Fig . 1A ) . The functional domains of HIP - 55 , including consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites Tyr - 334 / 344 and the SH3 domain ( amino acids 374 to 431 ) were absent in the expressed fusion protein . Therefore , we predicted that the expressed product would not be functional . Successful targeting was conﬁrmed by Southern blotting anal - ysis of DNA from targeted embryonic stem cells and from the progeny of “heterozygous - by - heterozygous” mating ( Fig . 1B ) . Reverse transcription - PCR analysis using primers to the N terminus , middle part , and C terminus of HIP - 55 demon - strated that there were no mRNA products for the middle part ( Fig . 1C , lane 2 ) and C terminus ( Fig . 1C , lane 3 ) in HIP - 55 knockout mice . Though detectable , the level of the N - terminal mRNA product in knockout mice was much lower than that of the wild type ( Fig . 1C , lane 1 ) . Western blotting analysis using an antibody recognizing the N - terminal peptide sequence amino acids 172 to 187 of HIP - 55 conﬁrmed the complete loss of native HIP - 55 expression in the thymus and spleen of the HIP - 55 knockout mice ( Fig . 1D ) . A fusion protein of truncated HIP - 55 and (cid:6) - geo was barely detectable in the splenic cell lysate from HIP - 55 knockout mice by Western blotting analysis , and the protein expression level was extremely low and less than 0 . 5 % of the native HIP - 55 expression ( Fig . 1E ) . This fusion protein was not detectable using an anti - C - terminal HIP - 55 antibody ( Fig . 1E ) , suggesting that the fusion protein contains only the N - terminal HIP - 55 . As shown by our RNA and protein analyses , the gene trapping strategy disrupted the normal transcription and translation of native HIP - 55 and caused a phenotypically null allele and HIP - 55 deﬁciency in mice . HIP - 55 knockout mice are viable and fertile but show lower body weight and high occurrence of death . The HIP - 55 knock - FIG . 3 . Lymphoid organ development .

However , both male and female HIP - 55 knockout mice showed lower body weight com - pared to the wild - type littermates ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Moreover , the HIP - 55 knockout mice showed some unhealthy symptoms , including slightly trembling hind limbs and partial tail paraly - sis . The offspring produced from breeding among HIP - 55 het - erozygous mice did not show Mendelian ratios . Of 1 , 484 viable offspring , 415 ( 28 . 0 % ) were wild type , 823 ( 55 . 5 % ) were het - erozygous , and only 246 ( 16 . 6 % ) were HIP - 55 homozygous knockout mice ( Fig . 2C ) . Among the viable HIP - 55 knockout mice , the numbers of male and female mice were comparable ( Fig . 2D ) . Our data indicate that HIP - 55 knockout mice have decreased body weight ( Fig . 2A and B ) , which may cause the high occurrence of death . Development of lymphoid organs is not affected by HIP - 55 deﬁciency . Although HIP - 55 knockout mice showed a decrease in body weight , initial analysis of the HIP - 55 knockout mice failed to identify signiﬁcant alterations in the cellularity and development of lymphoid organs . There was a slight decrease of the cell numbers in the spleens and thymi of HIP - 55 knock - out mice compared to wild - type littermates ( Fig . 3A ) . Both strains showed comparable ratios of thymic CD4 (cid:1) CD8 (cid:1) , CD4 (cid:1) CD8 (cid:8) , and CD4 (cid:8) CD8 (cid:1) cells ( Fig . 3B ) . Within the CD4 and CD8 double - negative population , the thymocytes can be further divided into four developmental stages based on CD25 and CD44 expressions ; no obvious defect in the double - negative thymocyte development was observed in HIP - 55 knockout mice ( Fig . 3B ) . In the spleens and lymph nodes , there were similar proportions of CD4 (cid:1) and CD8 (cid:1) cells be - tween wild - type and HIP - 55 knockout mice ( Fig . 3C ) . No ob - vious perturbation of the T - and B - cell ratio appeared in the spleens of HIP - 55 knockout mice as measured by CD3 / B220 staining ( Fig . 3C ) . The data indicate that HIP - 55 is not essen - tial for the normal development of lymphoid cells . FIG . 4 . Defective TCR - induced proliferation , cytokine production , and up - regulation of activation marker in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . ( A and B ) Splenic ( A ) and lymph node ( B ) T cells from wild - type ( WT ) and HIP - 55 knockout ( KO ) mice were left unstimulated or stimulated with different concentrations of anti - CD3 antibody or phorbol myristate acetate ( P ; 20 ng / ml ) and ionomycin ( I ; 0 . 1 (cid:7) M ) for 48 h , and then pulsed with [ 3 H ] thymidine for the last 16 h . Each assay was performed in triplicate wells , and data are representative of three experiments . ( C ) Puriﬁed splenic T cells from wild - type and HIP - 55 knockout mice were left unstimulated or stimulated with different concentrations of prebound anti - CD3 antibody . The supernatant was collected after 64 h and the interleukin - 2 was measured using ELISA . Data are representative of three independent experiments . The error bars are standard deviations from replicates of the representative experiment . The difference is statistically signiﬁcant ( P (cid:9) 0 . 01 ) . ( D ) Wild - type and HIP - 55 knockout splenic T cells were stimulated with 1 (cid:7) g / ml anti - CD3 antibody and cultured for 24 h . The cells were stained with anti - CD4 - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate and anti - CD69 - phycoerythrin and analyzed by FACSCaliber . Data are representative of the CD4 (cid:1) population .

To assess the properties of lymphocytes lacking HIP - 55 , we examined the effect of HIP - 55 deﬁciency on T - cell proliferation . Mea - sured by [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation , HIP - 55 knockout splenic and lymph node T cells were markedly defective in their ability to proliferate in response to anti - CD3 - mediated TCR signaling compared to the wild - type counterparts ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Their proliferative response to a combination of phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate and ionomycin was similar to that of wild - type T cells ( Fig . 4A ) , which indicates that the defect in proliferation is upstream of protein kinase C and Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux in the TCR signaling cascade and the general signaling remains intact . When we examined the interleukin - 2 production of T cells after anti - CD3 stimulation , we found that HIP - 55 knockout T cells showed lower cytokine production compared to wild - type T cells ( Fig . 4C ) . After TCR ligation , T cells undergo a series of signaling events , including cytokine secretion and up - regulation of cell surface activation markers . CD69 is a known activation marker that appears after TCR engagement and that indicates the activation status of T cells ( 5 , 9 ) . To further analyze the effect of HIP - 55 deﬁciency on T - cell function , splenic T cells were stimulated with anti - CD3 for 24 h and stained with anti - CD69 to study the up - regulation of this T - cell activation marker . We found that the stimulated HIP - 55 knockout T - cells expressed lower amounts of CD69 ( Fig . 4D ) on the cell surface compared to wild - type T cells , as indicated by the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of stimulated CD4 (cid:1) T cells . Together these results demonstrate that HIP - 55 positively regulates T - cell prolifera - tion , cytokine production , and activation marker up - regulation induced by TCR stimulation . TCR internalization in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . There is evidence that HIP - 55 is involved in endocytosis ( 27 ) . Using mainly an overexpression system , HIP - 55 was shown to pro - mote the down - regulation of TCR expression in Jurkat T cells FIG . 5 . TCR internalization in HIP - 55 knockout T cells .

When we examined TCR internalization in HIP - 55 knockout T cells , we observed only a slight decrease of TCR (cid:6) and CD3 ε before and after TCR stimulation compared to wild - type cells ( Fig . 5A and B ) . Consistently , we also observed a minor decrease of CD3 ε in the HIP - 55 shRNA - transfected Jurkat T cells ( Fig . 5C ) . The data indicate that HIP - 55 is not essential for TCR internalization . Reduced immune responses in HIP - 55 knockout mice . The activation of T lymphocytes plays a central role in the regula - tion of immune responses ( 2 , 28 ) . To determine whether the reduced T - cell proliferation in HIP - 55 knockout mice leads to reduced immune responses , we immunized mice with 4 - hy - droxy - 3 - nitrophenylacetyl ( NP ) coupled to chicken (cid:3) globulin ( NP - CGG ) , and antigen - speciﬁc antibody production was ex - amined using ELISA . HIP - 55 knockout mice showed de - creased T - cell - dependent primary immune response as mea - sured by antigen ( NP ) - speciﬁc IgG1 production ( Fig . 6A ) . After rechallenged with NP - CGG , the antigen - speciﬁc IgG1 production was also lower in HIP - 55 knockout mice ( Fig . 6A ) , which indicates that the secondary immune response was also affected by HIP - 55 deﬁciency . Moreover , the antigen - speciﬁc IgM production was also decreased in HIP - 55 knockout mice during the primary immune response ( Fig . 6B ) . In addition , when the enlarged lymph nodes were isolated from immunized mice and reactivated with NP - CGG in vitro , HIP - 55 knockout cells showed markedly reduced antigen - speciﬁc T - cell prolif - eration and cytokine production as measured by [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation and ELISA assays ( Fig . 7A and B ) . In contrast , phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin induced comparable T - cell proliferation in wild - type and knockout mice ( Fig . 7A ) . Thus , HIP - 55 knockout mice are defective in T - cell - dependent immune responses as measured by antigen - speciﬁc antibody production and T - cell proliferation . Decreased JNK / HPK1 activation and LAT / PLC (cid:1) 1 phos - phorylation in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . HIP - 55 has been shown to be important for JNK and HPK1 activation in TCR signaling ( 14 ) . Therefore , we examined the TCR - induced ac - tivation of HPK1 / JNK cascade in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . After TCR stimulation , JNK and HPK1 were immunoprecipi - tated from the cell lysate and in vitro kinase assays were per - formed using GST – c - Jun or myelin basic protein as a substrate . We found that both JNK and HPK1 activation after TCR FIG . 6 . Reduced antigen - speciﬁc antibody production in HIP - 55 knockout mice . ( A ) Five wild - type ( WT ) and ﬁve HIP - 55 knockout ( KO ) mice were immunized with NP - CGG . Serum was collected at 7 and 30 days ( day 0 for secondary response ) after the ﬁrst immunization and 5 days after the second immunization . NP - speciﬁc IgG1 production was determined by ELISA and is presented as relative units compared to the standard . Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test . The data are derived from ﬁve mice in each group ; the difference is statistically signiﬁcant ( P (cid:9) 0 . 02 for day 7 , P (cid:9) 0 . 01 for day 30 and day 5 after the boost ) . ( B ) Anti - NP - speciﬁc IgM from immunized mice was measured as described for A .

We also examined the activation of another mitogen - activated protein kinase , p38 , using an antibody speciﬁc for phospho - p38 and found that the activation of p38 was also decreased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells ( Fig . 8C ) . Besides the HPK1 and JNK pathways , the activation ( ty - rosine phosphorylation ) of PLC (cid:3) 1 and LAT after TCR stim - ulation was also investigated in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . PLC (cid:3) 1 was immunoprecipitated from an anti - CD3 antibody - treated T cells and the phosphorylation level was examined using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody . We found that the phosphorylation of PLC (cid:3) 1 was reduced in HIP - 55 knockout T cells compared to wild - type T cells ( Fig . 9A ) . Moreover , the inducible phosphorylation of LAT after TCR stimulation was also decreased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells ( Fig . 9B ) . To further conﬁrm these results , the tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of LAT and PLC (cid:3) 1 was examined in HIP - 55 knockdown Jurkat T cells using shRNA ( 14 ) and similar signaling defects were observed ( Fig . 9C and D ) . Taken together , our results demonstrate that HIP - 55 is important for TCR - induced sig - naling events , including HPK1 / JNK activation and LAT / PLC (cid:3) 1 phosphorylation . DISCUSSION Our results have revealed that HIP - 55 is an important reg - ulator of TCR signaling and the immune system . In HIP - 55 knockout mice , T cells showed reduced proliferation , lower cytokine production , and decreased activation marker up - reg - ulation compared to wild - type T cells after TCR stimulation . The reduced T - cell activation led to the reduced antigen - spe - ciﬁc immune responses in HIP - 55 knockout mice . The TCR - induced activation of HPK1 / JNK and tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT / PLC (cid:3) 1 were partially defective in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . In a previous report ( 14 ) , using HIP - 55 knockdown Jurkat T cells , we demonstrated that HIP - 55 is important for the down - stream events , including JNK and HPK1 activation , in TCR signaling . Consistent with our previous results , the HIP - 55 knockout T cells showed reduced proliferation and activation . TCR signaling is very important for T - cell development ; how - ever , we did not observe any signiﬁcant developmental defects in the lymphoid organs of the HIP - 55 knockout mice , although the defects in TCR signaling in peripheral organs were obvi - ous . It is possible that HIP - 55 plays a more critical role in mature T cells than in immature T cells , or perhaps HIP - 55 may have different functions at different stages of T - cell devel - opment , as shown in several other TCR signaling molecules ( 30 , 31 , 33 ) . Moreover , we have not investigated subtler defects in the development of lymphoid organs , which may be affected by HIP - 55 deﬁciency . Although viable and fertile , HIP - 55 knockout mice displayed decreased body weight and increased occurrence of death . Besides its expression and functions in T cells , HIP - 55 is a ubiquitously expressed protein ( 11 , 20 ) and also has known functions in the neuronal system ( 12 ) . Therefore , the changes we observed in body weight and death incidence may not be related to the immune system . From our observation , most of the deaths of HIP - 55 knockout mice occurred in the ﬁrst 4 weeks after birth . Moreover , the HIP - 55 knockout mice showed other unhealthy symptoms , including slightly trembling hind limbs and partial tail paralysis , which are signs of a po - tential neurological disorder in the HIP - 55 knockout mice . It is likely that HIP - 55 has important functions in the development of other organs , including the central nervous system , which leads to reduced body weight , a higher frequency of death , and other unhealthy phenotypes in the HIP - 55 knockout mice . The mechanism of how HIP - 55 regulates TCR signaling and immune responses is still under investigation . We observed that TCR - induced activation of HPK1 / JNK and p38 was par - tially decreased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells , which is consistent with the previous results in HIP - 55 shRNA knockdown Jurkat T cells ( 14 ) . Moreover , the phosphorylation of LAT and PLC (cid:3) 1 was also decreased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . The decreased activation of TCR signaling events may contribute to the T - cell proliferation and activation defects we observed in HIP - 55 knockout mice . HIP - 55 constitutively interacts with HPK1 ( 11 , 22 ) , which binds to several adaptor proteins ( 4 ) in TCR signaling com - plexes , including LAT ( 23 ) , SLP - 76 ( 29 ) , Gads / Grap2 ( 25 , 26 ) , Grb2 ( 3 , 23 ) , and Crk / CrkL ( 24 ) . It is possible that HIP - 55 may FIG . 7 . Decreased antigen - speciﬁc T - cell proliferation and cyto - kine production . Wild - type ( WT ) and HIP - 55 knockout ( KO ) mice were immunized with NP - CGG . Seven days later , the cells from en - larged draining lymph nodes were isolated and restimulated with CGG or phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus ionomycin ( I ) for 64 h , and proliferation was measured using thymidine incorporation assay ( A ) and interleukin - 2 in the supernatant was measured using ELISA ( B ) . Data are representative of three independent experiments . The error bars are standard deviations from replicates of the representative experiment . The difference is statistically signiﬁcant ( P (cid:9) 0 . 01 ) . 6876 HAN ET AL . M OL . C ELL .

After TCR stimulation , HIP - 55 translocates into lipid rafts ( 14 , 22 ) . As an actin - binding protein , HIP - 55 may also potentially affect the immune synapse formation and TCR signaling by regulating the cytoskeleton reorganization . HIP - 55 inducibly interacts with and is phosphorylated by upstream kinase ZAP - 70 in TCR signaling ( 14 ) . Since ZAP - 70 is critical for TCR signaling and T - cell functions ( 10 , 32 ) , it is also possible that HIP - 55 may function in regulating ZAP - 70 activation by modulating the recruitment of ZAP - 70 to the TCR complex through cytoskeleton reorganization in TCR signaling . There is evidence indicating that HIP - 55 negatively FIG . 8 . Decreased activation of HPK1 / JNK in HIP - 55 knockout T cells . Wild - type ( WT ) and HIP - 55 knockout ( KO ) T cells were stimulated using an anti - CD3 antibody and in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays were performed to examine JNK ( A ) and HPK1 ( B ) kinase activity using GST – c - Jun or myelin basic protein ( MBP ) as a substrate . The kinase assays were performed three times and the induction of JNK kinase activity at 5 min was quantitated using the Kodak Image Station ( lower panel in A ) . The error bars are standard deviations for the three experiments . The difference is statistically signiﬁcant ( P (cid:9) 0 . 01 ) . Western blotting was performed to examine the activation of p38 using an anti - phospho - p38 antibody ( C ) . FIG . 9 .

Wild - type ( WT ) and HIP - 55 knockout ( KO ) puriﬁed splenic T cells were stimulated using an anti - CD3 antibody . ( A ) The cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti - PLC (cid:3) 1 antibody . Western blot analysis was performed using antiphosphotyrosine and anti - PLC (cid:3) 1 antibodies . ( B ) Cell lysates from unstimulated or stimulated T cells of wild - type and knockout mice were subjected to Western blot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine ( anti - p - Tyr ) , anti - LAT , and anti - (cid:3) - tubulin antibodies . ( C and D ) Jurkat T cells were stimulated using an anti - CD3 antibody ( OKT3 ) . Cell lysates from vector - transfected and HIP - 55 shRNA - transfected Jurkat T cells were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - PLC (cid:3) 1 ( C ) and anti - LAT ( D ) antibodies . Western blot analysis was performed using antiphosphotyrosine , anti - PLC (cid:3) 1 ( C ) , and anti - LAT ( D ) antibodies .

However , we did not observe any signiﬁcant increase of TCR expression using HIP - 55 knockout primary T cells or shRNA knockdown Jurkat T cells . In contrast , we demon - strated that both CD3 ε and TCR (cid:6) were slightly decreased in HIP - 55 knockout T cells before and after TCR stimulation . This slightly accelerated TCR internalization may partially contribute to decreased signaling and other downstream events . The genetic evidence we provided using knockout mice and shRNA knockdown T cells indicates that HIP - 55 positively regulates T - cell proliferation and activation . Besides its role in TCR signaling , it is likely that HIP - 55 also has regulatory functions in other signaling pathways involved in antigen - presenting cell functions . It is known that HIP - 55 is also involved in B - cell receptor signaling ( 20 ) , and Syk shares similar regulatory mechanisms with ZAP - 70 ( 21 ) ; therefore , it is possible that HIP - 55 may also interact with Syk , which affects B cells , or other antigen - presenting cells . It would be worth - while to study the functions of HIP - 55 in different cell types of the immune system . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank W . Wang and M .
