SymbolFinder takes as input an abstract concept like reform and provides a set of related and diverse clusters like “ reform , modify , change ” , “ fix , amend , redo ” , “ new , update , innovative ” , and “ structure , building , framework ” which capture different meanings and concepts associated with reform . Users can explore these clusters to find diverse representations of the concept . Visual symbols are the building blocks for visual communication . They convey abstract concepts like reform and participation with concrete objects like scaffolding and key . Student designers struggle to brainstorm diverse symbols because they need to recall associations instead of recognizing them and they fixate on a few associations instead of exploring different related contexts . We present SymbolFinder , an interactive tool for finding visual symbols for abstract concepts . SymbolFinder molds symbol - finding into a recognition rather than recall task by introducing the user to diverse clusters associated with the concept . Users can dive into these clusters to find related , concrete objects that can symbolize the concept . We evaluate SymbolFinder with two studies : a comparative user study , demonstrating that SymbolFinder helps novices find more unique symbols for abstract concepts with significantly less effort than a popular image database and a case study demonstrating how SymbolFinder helped design students create symbol - blends for three cover illustrations of news articles .

Four visual symbols , from four domains : trans - portation hubs , human - computer interfaces , logos , pub - lic service announcements . Visual symbols play a vital role in daily commu - nication . They are placed on signs to help us lo - cate services in transport hubs and public build - ings , like the “lost and found” sign in Figure 2 . They are used in human - computer interfaces to represent actions a user can take , such as the search icon symbol . They represent organi - zations and companies like the World Wildlife Fund’s logo . Symbols are also combined in im - ages to represent more complicated messages like “Earth is melting” in the public service an - nouncement in Figure 2 . Visual symbols are an important part of how we convey information . While visual symbols come up in a wide range of different contexts , each symbol in Figure 2 share a key similarity : each represents an abstract idea with a concrete object . In the “lost and found” sign , the idea of items commonly misplaced is represented by an umbrella and a glove . In the look - up icon , search is represented by a magnifying glass . In the WWF logo , endangered is represented by a panda bear . Finally , in the public service announcement , global warming is represented by the Earth and an ice cream cone . These types of symbols are known as “representational icons , ” which consist of simple images of familiar objects that represent abstract ideas [ 36 ] . While there has been a great deal of work in the graphic arts and in icon design on how to create representational icons given a representative object [ 27 ] [ 16 ] , the problem of how to find these representative objects in the first place has been relatively overlooked . Visual language is constantly evolving . New symbols are constantly being created to represent new experiences , organizations , and interactions on interfaces [ 24 ] . Novices with little to no experience in graphic design are also creating symbols and icons for logos , websites , slide decks , mobile apps and games . Novices have difficulty not only designing icons from concrete objects , but also finding concrete objects to represent the concepts they want to symbolize in the first place . Even more difficult is finding symbols that can be combined or blended to create a new meaning . For example , a cover illustration for a news article on “police reform” could try to convey the message by combining symbols of police and symbols of reform . The two symbols must be combined in such a way that their shapes blend naturally and the combined design accurately reflects the emotional tone of the message [ 10 ] [ 21 ] . To accommodate such constraints and create many design alternatives , it is essential to find a diverse set of symbols for the abstract concepts being depicted . However , converting these abstract concepts into a diverse set of visual representations is hard for novice designers , preventing them from effectively combining them to convey a message . In order to understand the challenges and workflow of novice designers , we conducted a for - mative study , where novice participants used Google Images , a popular image database , to find symbols for abstract concepts . We observed that novices relied almost exclusively on recalling their own associations about the concept to search for related images . They often had difficulty brainstorming many different related words , and ended up fixating on a narrow set of associations , which represented a limited aspect of the concept being symbolized . Novices needed help to explore diverse ideas , which is crucial to finding an effective and creative solution [ 40 ] [ 50 ] . Finally , novices struggled to convert abstract associations into concrete objects and actions that could visually represent the concept . Inspired by these observations , we created SymbolFinder to help novices to find compelling visual symbols . SymbolFinder helps users brainstorm associations by providing related words from an expansive word association data set . By clustering the related words into groups , each of which represents a related but distinct aspect of the concept , SymbolFinder encourages users to explore a 2 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

To create these clusters , SymbolFinder constructs a semantic network of word associations and detects highly connected communities of words . Finally , SymbolFinder helps users find imageable objects and actions by organizing words related to each cluster by word - concreteness . This paper presents the following contributions : • SymbolFinder : an interactive interface for finding concrete images to represent abstract concepts . • A technique for applying local semantic networks to help brainstorm distinct , concrete associations for abstract concepts . • A preliminary study demonstrating that by organizing word - associations into clusters , users had to search less for diverse symbols and felt they were better able to brainstorm . • A user study demonstrating that SymbolFinder enables users to find significantly more unique symbols with less perceived effort than with Google Images , a popular image database used to find symbols . • A case study showing the use of SymbolFinder in practice , in which a team of 3 design students create cover illustrations , consisting of symbol blends , for 3 articles . SymbolFinder helped the team find a diverse set of symbols for the concepts of each article , which they successfully combined to form more than 10 different symbol - blend prototypes each . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Visual Symbols Symbols are fundamental in visual communication and are used in a variety of contexts . They accompany headlines in news articles [ 24 ] , represent actions in computer interfaces [ 46 ] [ 27 ] , guide people in transportation hubs [ 41 ] , represent corporations in logos [ 36 ] , and form associations with products in advertisements [ 30 ] . There are many advantages in communicating ideas with symbols . Symbols often require less space to encapsulate an idea than using the word itself , saving space in interfaces , maps , and signs [ 23 ] . People can more quickly and easily recognize symbols than words because of our innate visual processes [ 29 ] [ 46 ] . Symbols are more universally understood than words across cultures , which is why they are used and designed for international transportation hubs [ 41 ] [ 35 ] . Finally , depicting ideas pictorially aids their memorability and recognition [ 4 ] [ 3 ] . For these reasons , we built SymbolFinder , to help convey more abstract ideas visually . 2 . 2 Brainstorming and Exploration Tools Many tools have been created to help people brainstorm and explore related ideas . These systems are often designed to present a small set of related words or images to inspire new ideas . To present related textual ideas , InspirationWall [ 1 ] presents a few related topics from a knowledge graph , V8Storming [ 33 ] uses word embeddings to find similar words to suggest , and CrowdBoard [ 33 ] utilizes a real - time crowd to suggest more personalized ideas . Other tools like Idea expander [ 49 ] and IdeaWall [ 45 ] present a few related images based on the current spoken ideas of its users . Koch et . al . created a cooperative contextual bandit system which recommends a few images that match the user’s current semantic and visual preferences [ 34 ] . While displaying closely related words and images is very helpful for finding symbols , it is also necessary that these recommendations encapsulate different aspects of the concept . SymbolFinder organizes a network of words into clusters capturing distinct associations , enabling users to explore diverse contexts and images for an abstract concept . Clustering is a popular method used to help users understand and explore large datasets . Scat - ter / Gather enables users to interactively choose clusters to find and explore specific documents 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 3 of 1 – 22 . 3 U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

Exploratory Lab Assistant presents clusters of documents to users as a preliminary step to help them label groups of documents themselves [ 18 ] . Recipescape clusters recipes for a dish based on the structure of its preparation , enabling users to find recipes with similar or different steps [ 9 ] . SymbolFinder clusters word associations to present users with diverse ideas related to the concept being symbolized . Word association data sets are often analyzed as networks , where words are nodes and edges represent associations between them [ 15 ] [ 14 ] . In this format , they are referred to as semantic networks . We construct a “local” semantic network , consisting of words near the concept being symbolized , and cluster it using a popular network clustering algorithm [ 2 ] . 2 . 3 Query Expansion and Exploratory Image Search The queries that users enter when searching for images are often ambiguous and can refer to many different real - world entities . Many researchers have recognized this problem and created tools to help users either clarify their search or find what they’re looking for by providing a diverse set of image results . Textual query suggestions are a common technique for helping a user clarify their search . Keywords can be extracted from the most relevant documents associated with the query [ 51 ] [ 7 ] or taken from commonly occurring pairs of queries from search logs [ 28 ] [ 20 ] . Zha et . al . improved upon this technique by showing clusters of visually similar images for each keyword to help users preview and compare the images for each keyword [ 52 ] . IGroup employs a similar technique , by extracting common phrases ( n - grams ) from the most relevant documents associated with the query and presenting clusters of images for each of these phrases [ 31 ] . While keyword suggestions help users disambiguate their queries , they do not let them explore the broader associated meanings and contexts of their search . By using a word associations dataset , SymbolFinder presents broader contexts that expand the users idea of the query to help them brainstorm . Instead of using the documents associated with the images , other tools expand queries with knowledge bases to capture diverse intentions . PARAgrab takes synonyms , hyponyms , and hyper - nyms from WordNet [ 39 ] and presents these as related searches to users [ 32 ] . Hoque et . al . use both the incoming and outgoing of links of the query’s Wikipedia page to provide a list of related queries [ 26 ] . A separate knowledge base is used to cluster these associations into categories like person , place , and location . CIDER adds to this work by spatially arranging the images from these different queries based on their visual attributes [ 25 ] . These tools serve to quickly disambiguate a user’s search , like separating Denzel Washington the actor from Washington D . C . , the place . However , the organization of these related concepts does not capture different meanings and greater contexts associated with the query . For example , for a query like reform , instead of returning a list of specific types of reform , SymbolFinder presents a set of diverse clusters , each encapsulating a different sense of reform like “fix , amend , redo” and “new , update , innovative” , to help the user brainstorm . There exist also a multitude of exploratory image search tools that help users explore diverse results by clustering images . Cai et . al . use text , link , and visual features to cluster a query’s image results [ 6 ] . Leuken et . al . create a similar system , involving a dynamic weighting function for the visual features , creating clusters that better align with a human’s idea of image diversity [ 48 ] . Fan et . al . create a visual “summary” of image results on Flickr by creating a topic network from user - generated tags . This enabled users to view an overview of the various images connected to their query and explore highly connected clusters [ 17 ] . By providing clusters of word - associations associated with the query , SymbolFinder also presents an overview of diverse contexts related to the query . However , a crucial component of SymbolFinder is the ability to dive deeper into each cluster and explore concrete words . By incorporating concreteness and in - depth exploration of each cluster , SymbolFinder helps users find objects to symbolize their abstract query . 4 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 4 of 1 – 22 .

The rules for what makes a good symbol , derived from theory on icons and symbols , and explained with the concept : summer . These rules were shown to both raters and participants . 3 BACKGROUND : WHAT MAKES A GOOD SYMBOL ? Fig . 3 . The types of symbols include : representative ( indirectly and directly ) , as well as abstract ( radioactive symbol ) . According to the theory of symbols , there are three basic types of symbols : abstract , di - rectly representational , and indirectly repre - sentational [ 37 ] ( Figure 3 ) . A symbol is abstract when an abstract pattern represents the idea , like the radioactive symbol . A symbol is directly representational when its content is an exact representation of its idea , like the telephone symbol in Figure 3 . A symbol is indirectly rep - resentational when the image content is asso - ciated with but not an exact representation of the idea , like the coat hanger , which represents a coat check ( Figure 3 ) . SymbolFinder was built to help people find indirectly representational symbols for abstract terms that have a variety of meanings and contexts associated with them . These types of symbols do not require a new design like the radioactive symbol and are difficult to find with current image databases , unlike directly representational symbols , as these databases do not enable an exploration of various ideas related to the concept . A representational symbol can contain three things : a single object , a few related objects , or an action [ 27 ] . For example , the coat hanger is the most essential object related to a coat check , and thus makes a good single object symbol . Sometimes an extra object makes a symbol more specifically related to the idea it represents . For example , a scissor and a comb together represent a hair salon better than either one alone . The two of them together effectively represent the tools a hair stylist uses . Finally , a symbol can also contain an action , like the airport arrivals symbol , in which there is a man hailing a taxi . These three categories make up the vast majority of the content displayed in representational symbols . 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 5 of 1 – 22 . 5 U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

The most essential quality of a symbol is that it is recognizable . Its content should contain no more than what is necessary to depict the idea . Visual complexity and extra entities only make them slower to interpret and recognize . From this symbol theory , we establish a set of rules to help users of our system find good symbols ( Figure 4 ) . A good , indirectly representational symbol can be : • A single concrete object . The object must be able to represent the concept on its own ( Figure 4a ) . • Multiple related objects . The objects should be related to the concept and to each other , like the combination of the scissor and comb in Figure 3 . However , they should not be the same object , like the watermelon slices ( Figure 4e ) , since one is enough to convey the idea . Symbols with more than two representative objects , like the collection of unrelated beach objects in ( Figure 4e ) are too complicated and can be separated into separate symbols . • A concrete action . The action should be concrete and shown clearly , like the volleyball spike in ( Figure 4c ) , as opposed to the more complex volleyball scene in Figure 4f . • No abstract scenes . Symbols should depict a concrete object or action , instead of abstract landscapes ( Figure 4d ) . 4 FORMATIVE STUDY To better understand the pitfalls novices face when searching for symbols and how to help them , we conducted a formative study in which we observed participants search for symbols with a popular image database , Google Images . Google Images is often used by novice and professional icon designers to look up visualizations of concepts [ 53 ] . Its interface also has a number of features to help users search for particular images , including a list of suggested searches that appear above the image results , each consisting of a related term and a representative image . It also includes the ability to filter images by color and type ( clip Art and line drawing ) , under the “tools” section . Because of its popularity , usage by professional icon designers , and its features , we study how novices use Google Images when searching for symbols . We recruited 5 participants ( 3 male , 2 female , average age 24 . 8 ) . They found symbols for three abstract concepts : old , exciting , and innovation . These concepts were selected randomly from a visual messaging dataset , containing the most common concepts symbolized in online messages [ 30 ] . Prior to finding symbols , users were shown a slide - deck detailing the task : to find 20 unique symbols , and shown the good symbol rules ( Figure 4 ) . They had 10 minutes to find symbols for each concept . While searching they were asked to think aloud to convey their thought process . After each concept , users were asked to explain the benefits and drawbacks of Google Images , what search terms helped their brainstorming , and their general strategy . All five participants were frustrated by the lack of conceptual diversity in the images presented when searching the “concept” as is on Google Images . P1 and P2 both mentioned that the results for old predominantly contained images of old people . Similarly , upon seeing the image results for excited , P1 states , “These are all images of the word ‘excited’ . Or just people looking excited . ” While there was generally a couple representations of the concept in the first set of images produced by Google , users found that they needed to brainstorm on their own to find different symbols . The most common strategy to find different images was to search terms related to the concept and scan the image results for new visualizations . For example , P1 searched ancient , which he recalled on his own , and met many images of the Parthenon , the Colosseum , and pyramids . This turned out to be a fruitful context , from which he was able to collect an additional three symbols for old . Similarly , when seeing only images of excited people in the results for exciting , P2 subsequently searched fun and adventure . In doing so , he found other contexts related to exciting like extreme 6 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 6 of 1 – 22 . U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

Users had to recall these associations on their own . Therefore , our first design goal for SymbolFinder was to help users brainstorm related words , in order to enable recognition over recall . Users however also struggled to find related words that presented different images and concrete contexts related to the concept . For example , when searching for symbols of exciting , P2 searched for images of adventure and explore and was met with similar images of hiking and camping . While he was able to collect a number of symbols from these searches , it was difficult for him to think of another related word that encapsulated a different flavor of exciting . Eventually , he searched the word suspenseful and found images of horror movies and theatre which inspired more symbols . From this issue we formed our second design goal : when helping users brainstorm associations , we should ensure that we present diverse ideas in order to help them collect diverse symbols . Once users found a fruitful context , their strategy shifted to searching concrete objects and actions that they would select as their symbols . For example , while searching for symbols of innovation P2 started searching for advanced technology like virtual reality goggles and hovercrafts . Similarly for old , P1 searched for objects old people use like canes and wheelchairs . While more abstract searches like elder and technology served as inspiration , these highly concrete searches contained the images that would end up being their symbols . When exploring related contexts , users should be able to explore concrete words within these contexts to find representative objects and actions . Thus , our third design goal was to help users concretize abstract concepts . Design Goals . In summary , from the formative study we formed three design goals for the SymbolFinder : D1 : Help brainstorm related words to encourage recognition over recall . Users often recalled related terms to see new visualizations of the concept . By relying on their own memory , they miss obvious symbols and contexts associated with the concept . D2 : Symbol diversity . When helping users brainstorm related terms we should present them a variety of diverse associations so that they can collect diverse symbols from these associations . D3 : Concretize abstract concepts . As well as enabling users to explore diverse associations , they should also be able to explore related concrete terms for each association . This way , users can better find objects and actions to represent the concept . 5 SYMBOLFINDER To address these design goals , we present SymbolFinder , an interactive tool that enables novices to find symbols for abstract concepts , by facilitating an exploration of diverse contexts associated with a concept . SymbolFinder’s interface consists of two phases . Phase 1 is a breadth - first exploration of clusters of associations related to the concept ; users select clusters they would like to explore further ( Figure 5 ) . In phase 2 , users select symbols while exploring words and images associated with the clusters they selected in phase 1 ( Figure 6 ) . 5 . 1 Phase 1 : Breadth - first concept exploration Phase 1 addresses D1 ( help brainstorm related words ) and D2 ( symbol diversity ) . To help users brainstorm associations , we enable users to explore different words related to the concept . To encourage symbol diversity , similar related words are clustered together into associations that encapsulate a unique aspect of the concept . Each cluster is represented by its three most important words . For example , two clusters for control are “rule , government , governance” and ”handle , lever , knob” ( Figure 5 ) . Users scroll through the clusters and select clusters to explore further . For each cluster , the user is posed the following question : “Could symbols of [ word 1 ] , [ word 2 ] , [ word 3 ] represent [ concept ] ? ” . The user is instructed to answer this question based on the words . If they think there are potential symbols for these words that could represent the concept , then they press 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

Below this question are also 5 images related to these words ( Figure 5b ) . Users have the option to select an image if they think it is a good symbol . These images come from three Google Image searches , one for each of the words , where each query is formulated as follows : “ [ concept ] [ word ] ” . This is done to keep the results relevant to the concept . The queries for top cluster in figure 5 were : “control rule” , “control government” , and “control governance” . By having users explore each cluster briefly , we quickly expose them to a number of different associations , preventing fixation on any single association . 5 . 2 Phase 2 : Image selection within clusters Fig . 5 . Phase 1 for the concept : control . Users select relevant clusters they would like to explore further in phase 2 . Each cluster conveys a different association related to control , like the government ( top ) or physical tools we use to control machines . ( bottom ) . Phase 2 further supports D1 ( help brainstorm related words ) as well as D3 ( concretize abstract concepts ) . In phase 2 , users further explore the clusters they selected from phase 1 ( Figure 6a ) and select symbols ( Figure 6c ) . The key part of this interface is the sidebar on the left which is where users explore the clusters ( Figure 6a ) and recursively explore concrete words related to them ( Figure 6b ) . To support D3 , when users se - lect the top level cluster words , they are shown related words sorted by concreteness ( Figure 6b ) . In Figure 6 , the user selected the “rule , gov - ernment , governance” cluster . They then ex - panded regulation , one of the cluster words , and selected referee , a related concrete term . As well as exploring the clusters , users can also type associations they think of themselves in the “write your own” text boxes and view im - ages related to their entry . In this way , the sidebar enables users to recognize good symbols as well as use their own thought processes . The second key part of this interface is the set of Google Image search results that populate the screen when a word is selected ( Figure 6c ) . Four queries are made per word , and they include the word on its own [ referee ] , the word and its parent [ regulation referee ] , the concept and the word [ control referee ] , and finally the word and “icon” appended to the search [ referee icon ] . We include the parent and concept queries as they help keep images on topic . We include the icon query as they often provide simple images of the action or item we are looking for . Together , the sidebar of clusters and the multiple image searches effectively help users to find concrete symbols . 6 IMPLEMENTATION 6 . 1 D1 : Helping users brainstorm related words In the formative study , participants searched words related to the concept in order to find new images of symbols . This was a good strategy , but novices had difficulty recalling related words on their own , and missed many useful words . Therefore our first design goal was to help users brainstorm related words by making it a recognition rather than a recall task . First , in phase 1 , SymbolFinder presents clusters of word associations for users to browse and choose from . Then , in phase 2 , users can explore more related words associated with each cluster . We explored two different options for creating word associations : ( 1 ) Glove word embeddings , trained on Common Crawl [ 43 ] and ( 2 ) Small World of Words ( SWOW ) , a crowd - sourced word association database 8 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

Phase 2 : Users explore the clusters they chose from the first phase . On the left sidebar are the clusters , where users can explore related words . On the right are a few Google Image searches for the selected word , which here is “referee” . The user selected two images , indicated by the green boxes . [ 13 ] . Word embeddings are commonly used for comparing the similarity between words [ 38 ] and have been used in a number of brainstorming tools to compare the similarity of ideas [ 45 ] [ 8 ] . SWOW is a large English word association dataset . The dataset was created by having thousands of participants complete a free word association task , in which each participant records the first three words they think of when seeing a cue word . In initial testing , we found that SWOW produced words that were more relevant and concrete than those by Glove . For example , for the abstract word help , the most related words that Glove produces include words like : helping and need , which are related , but are not specific or concrete . Meanwhile SWOW produces terms like : donation , red cross , and tutor , giving specific actions , organizations , and people that help . These words are actually helpful for visualizing help . At the same time , word embeddings tend to also return antonyms when querying similar words , which was less of a problem with SWOW [ 42 ] . For these reasons , we chose SWOW to be our dataset for providing related words . 6 . 2 D2 : Diversity using Local Semantic Networks In the formative study , users struggled to think of related words that represented new associations with the concept they were symbolizing . They explored redundant terms and fixated on only a few related contexts . To support D2 and help users find diverse symbols , we cluster a large set of word associations and present a diverse set of contexts from which users can find symbols . Word association datasets are often analyzed as networks , where each word in the dataset is a node and each association is an edge . In this format , they are referred to as semantic networks . Researchers analyze these networks to identify important words in languages via network centrality measures as well as highly connected clusters of words [ 15 ] [ 14 ] . We leverage this technique to find clusters of words close to the concept we are symbolizing . We create a “local” semantic 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

We then run a popular network clustering algorithm on this network to identify sets of highly connected words that represent distinct associations of the concept . Fig . 7 . The construction of the local semantic network . 6 . 2 . 1 Constructing a local semantic network . Our high - level goal when constructing the lo - cal semantic network was to create a network consisting of a variety of words to generate a diverse set of clusters , without making the clusters too large so that they became indeci - pherable . To ensure a variety of words , we con - struct a network with two levels of nodes . This network consists of the root concept , its list of related words ( level 1 ) , and the related words of nodes in level 1 ( level 2 ) . This is shown in Figure 7 , where the root is control . The words of level 2 are still relevant to the root concept but also representative of a more specific asso - ciation to the root . For example , in Figure 7 , from control we get manage which yields boss . While boss is more directly associated with manage , it is still very related to control . Each word in SWOW has a set of associated words , each with a count indicating the number of unique participants who made that association . For every pair of nodes in the network , we create an undirected edge between them if they are associated , where the weight of that edge is the associated count . We do not construct a third level of words from the second as we found this includes many irrelevant nodes in the network , making the clusters less interpretable . By incorporating two levels of words , we ensure the words in the network are related to the concept and diverse . To ensure that the clusters do not get too large or indecipherable we set two constraints . The first constraint is that we take up to the first 𝑐 related words for the root concept to include in level 1 . We empirically determined 60 to be a suitable value for 𝑐 ; this leads to clusters containing on average 21 words . The size of the clusters will not vary much for small changes in 𝑐 , but generally when set to 90 or higher , the clusters tend to get large , containing on average 35 words , becoming less interpretable . That being said , the average number of related words per concept is 20 . 32 , with 6 . 1 % of the dataset containing more than 60 , so we generally take all of the root concept’s related words . The second constraint pertains to the nodes we add to level 2 . For each of the 𝑐 nodes , we take their first 𝑔 most related words not present in the network . We set 𝑔 to be 5 . We keep 𝑔 relatively low compared to 𝑐 because some level 1 nodes , like remote in figure 7 , introduce words unrelated to the root concept , control . Also by setting 𝑐 to 60 and 𝑔 to 5 , we ensure a maximum number of nodes that does not exceed 360 , which keeps the cluster sizes in the next step manageable . While simple , these settings produce a network that is reasonably sized and a set of clusters that are coherent but also diverse . 6 . 2 . 2 Clustering the network . Our goal is to present users a list of diverse and distinct ideas related to the concept . The local semantic network we create can contain up to a few hundred words . While containing many different associations , this is too large a space for users to explore without guidance . To condense this information into a manageable set of diverse associations , we cluster the network . Our goal is to create a set of clusters that contain highly related words that capture a distinct association of the concept . To cluster the network we considered two algorithms : the Clauset - Newman - Moore [ 11 ] and Louvain [ 2 ] network clustering algorithms . Both are very popular hierarchical clustering algorithms . From initial experimentation we determined that the Louvain 10 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 10 of 1 – 22 . U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

Associations sorted by strength of association ( related ) and by concreteness ( concrete ) for two abstract concepts : Exciting and Future . Concreteness surfaces imageable objects that can serve as symbols . algorithm produced more interpretable clusters , as the Clauset - Newman - Moore algorithm tended to produce fewer clusters with a greater number of words , often combining clusters that the Louvain algorithm separated . The Louvain algorithm optimizes modularity , a measure which compares the edge density of the nodes in a cluster to the edge density of the same nodes in a randomly generated network . In our case , the algorithm identifies communities of highly related words by grouping words connected with high edges weights . The algorithm returns a hierarchy of clusters . We use the highest level of clusters ( i . e . largest cluster size ) . For our dataset , the final pass of the algorithm generates about 12 to 20 clusters , which is small enough for a user to explore and large enough to contain a variety of unique ideas related to the concept . 6 . 3 D3 : Concretize abstract concepts In the formative study , even when users found relevant associations , they still had trouble identifying concrete objects and actions that could visually represent the concept . Therefore , our third design goal was to enable users to explore concrete words related to contexts associated with the concept . To support D3 , users can explore related concrete words for each of the words within the clusters . For example , in Figure 6c , the user expanded regulation , one of the cluster words , to view its related concrete words . The most concrete word related to regulation is referee , which led to two good symbols : a soccer referee and a whistle . Thus , by exploring these related concrete terms , users can find objects and actions related to abstract clusters like “rule , government , governance” . Concreteness is a measure of how physically perceptible something is . For example , words like seashell are more concrete than words like fun . To incorporate concreteness , we use a crowd - sourced dataset that includes concreteness ratings for 40 , 000 English words and phrases [ 5 ] . Crowd - workers rated words on a scale from 1 ( abstract ) to 5 ( concrete ) . When resorting the words , we incorporate both concreteness and strength of association , as sorting by concreteness alone leads to random words at the top . To include concreteness , we normalize the word’s association strength and multiply this value by the word’s concreteness score . We sort by this product . Consider the examples shown in Table 1 . Instead of abstract related terms like fun , the concrete lists provide imageable words like motorcycle that can symbolize the abstract concept : exciting . 7 PRELIMINARY CLUSTER STUDY To address D2 ( symbol diversity ) , SymbolFinder presents clusters of unique associations in order to enable users to easily explore a variety of symbols . In this study we evaluate whether the clusters represent coherent ideas related to the concept and whether they help users find different symbols more efficiently than a simple list of related words . We conducted a comparative user study where participants used two different versions of the SymbolFinder : ( 1 ) cluster interface , the tool as 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

The list interface is exactly like the cluster interface except for two key differences : ( 1 ) there is no phase 1 exploration of clusters , ( 2 ) the sidebar consists of the concept’s related words , sorted by strength of association . In the list - interface , users can still explore related , concrete terms for each of the concept’s related words . After using both versions of the interface , participants completed a semi - structured interview which gauged their preference of the interfaces and their opinions of the clusters’ usefulness . 7 . 0 . 1 Methodology . We recruited 6 participants ( 2 male , 4 female , average age of 24 . 7 ) . Each participant searched for symbols of two different concepts of similar concreteness , randomly chosen from the same visual message data set used in the formative study : Halloween ( concreteness = 0 . 64 ) and energy ( 0 . 62 ) . Half of the participants found symbols for energy with the cluster interface and Halloween with the list interface , while half did the opposite . Order of interface usage and concept assignments were randomized . They were given ten minutes to find 20 different symbols per concept . Prior to finding symbols for the two test concepts , they practiced finding symbols for summer with each system for up to 10 minutes . Afterwards , they completed a semi - structured interview . 7 . 0 . 2 Results . Participants found that most of the clusters were coherent and related to the concept . When using the cluster interface , participants kept on average 16 . 3 ( 𝜎 = 1 . 2 ) of the 19 energy clusters and 12 . 3 ( 𝜎 = 0 . 9 ) of the 16 Halloween clusters , indicating that the majority of clusters were deemed relevant . Generally , for both concepts , there were a couple clusters that users felt were unrelated , like the “harness , horse , dog” cluster for energy . But in the interview afterwards , all confirmed it was generally easy for them to rule out these clusters in phase 1 . Participants had to search less to find symbols with the cluster interface than with the list interface . Users expanded on average 42 . 5 ( 𝜎 = 5 . 7 ) words with the list - interface and 25 . 47 ( 𝜎 = 4 . 9 ) words with the cluster - interface . This difference is predominantly due to phase 1 ( Figure 5 ) of the cluster - interface , where participants collected on average 9 . 5 ( 𝜎 = 3 . 4 ) of the 20 symbols they were asked to find . Subsequently , in phase 2 ( Figure 6 ) , users were able to narrow their search and explore fewer words . All users preferred the cluster - interface over the list - interface because they appreciated searching less with the cluster - interface . P1 noted that exploring so many disparate words with the list - interface was “more frustrating . Everything was disorganized . I had to jump from one idea to another” . Users had to think more when using the list - interface . Clusters helped users brainstorm more associations . In the interviews , participants noted that clusters provided greater context to the related words , enabling them to think of more asso - ciations . For instance , for P2 , the clusters were “a jumping off point . I thought of different types of fuel and vehicles when I saw the ‘fuel gas car’ cluster . ” Meanwhile , words in the list - interface suffered from a lack of context . For example , when seeing green , a word associated with energy , P5 stated that she immediately thought of the color , instead of renewable energy , its actual association . Clusters formed more coherent ideas with clearer connections to the concept than single words . To summarize : participants found the clusters to be coherent and related to the concept , searched less for symbols with the cluster - interface than with the list - interface , and more easily formed their own connections with the clusters than with the list - interface . 8 EVALUATION In this study we evaluate whether users can find more unique symbols with SymbolFinder than with Google Images for both very abstract and less abstract concepts . Google Images is a good baseline as both professional icon designers and novice designers alike use it to browse visualizations of ideas [ 53 ] . We also compare the perceived difficulty of finding symbols with SymbolFinder to finding symbols with Google Images . 12 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 12 of 1 – 22 .

Users collected more unique symbols for each concept with SymbolFinder . Above are results for control , where the SymbolFinder user collected 15 unique symbols and the Google Image user collected 8 . 8 . 0 . 1 Methodology . We recruited 10 graduate students via e - mail through a local university : 2 female and 8 male , with an average age of 26 . 6 . Each participant found symbols for six concepts and after each concept , completed a NASA - TLX questionnaire to measure perceived effort [ 22 ] . Prior to finding symbols , each participant was shown a slide - deck explaining the task : find 20 different symbols for each term . They are also shown the symbol rules in Figure 4 ; we emphasize that the symbols should be unique , displaying different concrete objects and activities . We compare SymbolFinder with Google for concepts of varying levels of concreteness . The six concepts were randomly selected from the same visual messaging dataset [ 30 ] from three levels of concreteness : most concrete ( fast , concreteness = 0 . 66 , art , 0 . 83 ) , less concrete ( dangerous , 0 . 46 , rugged , 0 . 55 ) , least concrete ( control , 0 . 38 , simple , 0 . 32 ) . Users found symbols for the concepts in the following order : fast , dangerous , control , art , rugged , simple . To counterbalance the experiment , we had half of the participants use SymbolFinder for the first three concepts and half use it for the last three . For each tool , users find symbols for concepts from three different levels of concreteness . We hypothesize that users will find more unique symbols across all concepts with SymbolFinder . We also hypothesize that SymbolFinder will help more with the most abstract concepts , as concepts like simple and control apply to multiple diverse contexts , and SymbolFinder presents a diverse set of unique associations ( D2 ) . Prior to finding symbols , users practiced with each interface for ten minutes to collect symbols for the concept summer . During this practice , users were guided through the features of each tool . In the Google condition , participants used the standard Google Image web - page . They were shown the related search terms that appear above the images as well as the filter tools . While practicing , users could ask any questions about the goodness of their symbols . When finding symbols for the six concepts , they had a “cheat sheet” , containing the rules of figure 4 , but were no longer helped by the experimenter . Participants had 10 minutes to find 20 or more symbols for each concept . After finding symbols for each concept , participants completed a NASA Task Load Index ( NASA TLX ) survey , to understand their perceived effort for each word - tool combination [ 22 ] . The NASA TLX is a standard measure for subjective workload when using a tool , measuring : mental demand , physical demand , temporal demand , performance , effort , and frustration level . We hypothesize that users will find SymbolFinder easier to use as it helps users brainstorm associations ( D1 ) and find concrete objects ( D3 ) , requiring less mental demand and effort . We recruited two graduate students in design to annotate the collected images for unique , good symbols . They annotated good symbols based on the rules of Figure 4 , which are rooted in symbol theory . Along with these rules , annotators were instructed to reject images that seemed unrelated 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 13 of 1 – 22 . 13 U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

For fast ( a less abstract term ) and simple ( a very abstract term ) this difference is statistically significant . to the concept . As well as symbol goodness , the annotators also labeled duplicate symbols . They were instructed to label two images as duplicates if they conveyed the same object or activity , regardless of style , background or color . Because of the natural subjectivity of this task , we had the annotators label two practice sets of images for good and unique symbols together . They then annotated the images collected during the evaluation separately . 8 . 0 . 2 Results . We report the percent agreement between the two raters for determining good and unique symbols ( and the Cohen’s Kappa correlation coefficients ) to be 94 % ( 0 . 74 ) and 96 % ( 0 . 75 ) respectively . To calculate the results in Table 2 , we averaged the number of good and unique symbols determined by the raters for both conditions . Participants found more unique symbols with SymbolFinder . We conducted paired t - tests and found with SymbolFinder , participants collected significantly more unique , good symbols than with Google Images , finding an average of 14 . 8 unique symbols across the six concepts with SymbolFinder and 9 . 92 unique symbols with Google ( 𝑡 = 4 . 39 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 2 ) . Figure 8 shows results for control ; the SymbolFinder user almost doubles the amount of unique symbols found by the Google Image user . SymbolFinder users collected significantly more symbols , many of them good . Participants on average collected 26 . 1 symbols per concept with SymbolFinder compared to 16 . 2 with Google ( 𝑡 = 4 . 5 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) , with an average of 22 . 7 good symbols per concept , compared 14 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

In both conditions , users had a tendency to select multiple symbols of the same object or activity , leading to a drop off from good symbols to unique symbols . SymbolFinder helped users find more symbols for both very abstract and less abstract concepts . Participants were able to find more unique symbols for each of the six concepts with SymbolFinder than with Google , regardless of the concept’s concreteness ( Table 4 ) . We conducted unpaired t - tests and found the difference in unique symbols was statistically significant for two concepts : fast a less abstract term and simple , a more abstract term . Participants collected an average of 18 . 4 unique symbols for fast with SymbolFinder and 10 . 7 with Google ( 𝑡 = 6 . 4 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . For simple , participants collected 14 . 3 unique symbols with SymbolFinder and 7 . 3 with Google ( 𝑡 = 2 . 4 , 𝑝 = 0 . 04 ) . For both these terms , despite their difference in abstractness , SymbolFinder presented a number of associations Google users did not consider . For example , when finding symbols for simple with Google , participants fixated on a single meaning of simple , “easily understood” and collected symbols of shapes and simple mathematics . Meanwhile , SymbolFinder users found symbols for this context and many others , including “primitive” and “pure” , collecting symbols like the caveman wheel and a water droplet . A similar effect occurred with dangerous , where SymbolFinder users found 53 % more symbols than Google users . Meanwhile , SymbolFinder was less useful for art , the most concrete concept . While the clusters provided many different associations , like sculpture , painting , film , and more , it was relatively easy for users to brainstorm many concrete items on their own with Google Images . SymbolFinder was easier to use than Google . A summary of the NASA - TLX results are shown in Table 3 . Participants found using SymbolFinder to be significantly less mentally demanding than Google Images , reporting an average mental demand of 5 . 13 with SymbolFinder and 6 . 8 with Google Images ( 𝑡 = − 3 . 98 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Similarly , frustration was also significantly lower with SymbolFinder ( 3 ) than with Google ( 4 . 33 ) , ( 𝑡 = − 2 . 23 , 𝑝 = 0 . 034 ) . Users often hit dead - ends of redundant symbols with Google , increasing frustration and mental demand as they brainstormed unassisted for new ideas . Physical demand was significantly lower for SymbolFinder , with an average of 1 . 97 , compared to 3 . 97 with Google ( 𝑡 = − 4 . 85 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . This is likely due to users having to copy and paste images from Google into a slide - deck . For the same reasons as mental and physical demand , effort was also significantly lower for SymbolFinder ( 4 . 87 ) than Google ( 7 . 43 ) , ( 𝑡 = − 6 . 41 , 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ) . Temporal demand was lower with SymbolFinder ( 5 . 13 ) than Google ( 6 . 17 ) , but not significantly so ( 𝑡 = 1 . 7 , 𝑝 = 0 . 1 ) . When users ran out of ideas with Google , they felt a greater time pressure to find 20 symbols . Some users felt more time pressure with SymbolFinder as they wanted to explore all the related words and images . Finally , participants felt they had performed better with SymbolFinder ( 6 . 77 ) than with Google ( 5 . 9 ) , but this difference was not significant ( 𝑡 = 1 . 95 , 𝑝 = 0 . 06 ) . 9 CASE STUDY To evaluate how SymbolFinder helps people in practice , we found a group of three students who make cover illustrations for a school science publication . We asked them to use SymbolFinder as a group in their process over a three month period to help them make symbol blends that could serve as cover illustrations . We remotely observed them in three 90 - minute sessions where they used SymbolFinder together as a part of their process for making blends for three different articles , one from their school science publication and two chosen from The New York Times for content diversity : ( 1 ) “Public Health Messaging in Minority Communities and COVID - 19’s Neurological Effects” Concept pair : Diversity ( concreteness = 0 . 45 ) + Neurology ( 0 . 5 ) 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

People with disabilities are wondering whether virtual accommodations will last . ” ( NYT ) Concept pair : Disability ( 0 . 69 ) + Participation ( 0 . 52 ) From our observations we wanted to answer the following four questions : ( 1 ) End - to - end process . Where does SymbolFinder fit in the process of creating cover illustra - tions that blend symbols ? ( 2 ) Picking concepts for articles . What kind of concepts do they enter into SymbolFinder and how do they choose them ? ( 3 ) Picking symbols . What is their process of finding symbols and how does SymbolFinder help ? ( 4 ) Combining symbols . How do they use the symbols to make the blends ? 9 . 1 Results 9 . 1 . 1 End - to - end process . We observed their end - to - end process of making symbols blends for cover illustrations , which generally consisted of five steps : ( 1 ) finding an article that needs a cover illustration , ( 2 ) picking two words that represents the article’s key concepts , ( 3 ) use SymbolFinder to find images to represent the two concepts , ( 4 ) match these symbols to ideate blends , ( 5 ) create prototypes of these blends with either PowerPoint for lo - fi blends or Photoshop for hi - fi blends . To answer the rest of the questions , we will discuss one of the case studies from beginning to end , highlighting how the team used SymbolFinder and the constraints that emerged when making blends . We study how they made blends for the NYT article : “The N . Y . P . D . Has Rejected Reform for Decades . It Can’t Anymore . ” 9 . 1 . 2 Picking concepts for articles . The team often picked one or two very abstract concepts to symbolize in the cover illustration . A key part of their process was to scan both the article title and text to extract potential concepts to symbolize and combine . Their goal was to identify concepts that best capture the meaning of the article , and often these words are abstract . For example , while working on the second article : “The N . Y . P . D . Has Rejected Reform for Decades . It Can’t Anymore” , the team quickly picked police , a relatively concrete concept , as one of the keywords , as it was the clear subject of the article . For the second concept , they had a few candidates , including reform ( concreteness = 0 . 4 ) , law ( 0 . 51 ) , and scrutiny ( 0 . 45 ) , which are all very abstract words . In this case , they chose both reform and law . Similarly , for the other articles , they picked abstract concepts , like diversity ( 0 . 45 ) , participation ( 0 . 52 ) , and neurology ( 0 . 5 ) . Given the content the articles , the team often found themselves symbolizing abstract concepts . 9 . 1 . 3 Picking symbols . We observed that when they collected symbols , their focus was to find different representations of the concept , as opposed to finding the perfect image for one particular representation . SymbolFinder helped them find different representations in two ways : ( 1 ) by exposing them to multiple different ideas through the clusters and ( 2 ) by presenting them with concrete objects within clusters to find symbols from these different ideas . In the first phase of SymbolFinder for police , the team found multiple distinct contexts associated with police , many of which led to symbols in phase 2 . They selected 16 of 20 clusters shown to them in the first phase . Among these was the first ( and most obvious ) cluster “police , cop , officer” as well as others that captured different aspects of police such as “questioning , interrogation , skeptical” and “brutality , riots , violence” . Ultimately the first obvious cluster provided the most symbols , about 16 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 16 of 1 – 22 . U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

The second most fruitful cluster was “brutality , riots , violence” , containing 10 % of their total number of symbols . On average , users used 6 . 83 clusters presented in SymbolFinder , demonstrating that the clusters were useful for finding multiple visual representations of the concepts . In the second phase of SymbolFinder for police , while diving into clusters , the team took advantage of the concrete sub - words to collect many different objects associated with that cluster . While searching for symbols of police , the team first explored the most obvious cluster “police , cop , officer” in phase 2 . The image searches generated for each of these terms consisted of images of police officers in different poses and settings , but not specific objects related to police officers . However , when drilling into this cluster and viewing related subwords of its terms , they were presented with many concrete , associated objects like siren , handgun , badge , and baton . They then selected each of these objects and quickly collected 3 or 4 images of each one , including realistic images , icons , and objects of different shapes . Remarking on this process , P3 explained that when collecting images of an object , it is useful to gather images with different styles because “it sparks more ideas later on when we’re matching symbols . We’re not really sure what kind of images we’ll need , so having symbols with different colors and shapes helps in imagining blends . ” Overall , SymbolFinder helped the team collect objects with different stylistic properties thanks to concreteness and SymbolFinder’s many image search results ; these two features helped them collect a greater diversity of symbols . In the first phase of SymbolFinder for reform , the team found that while the clusters introduced new ideas , some were not a great match with the content of the article . They selected only 7 of 18 clusters shown to them . The clusters they did not pick were related to reform , but brought in connotations that did not fit with the overarching message : “police reform” . For example , they rejected “political party , progressive , republican” , which while related to reforming politics , is not so relevant to police reform . Instead , the team opted for clusters that contained different perspectives on what reform can be , like “reform , modify , change” , “fix , amend , redo” , and “new , update , innovative” . Therefore , the content of the article constrains the symbol search space , and phase 1 of SymbolFinder helped the team navigate this constraint by quickly eliminating irrelevant clusters . In the second phase for reform , a second constraint on the symbol space became apparent : the connotation and tone of the symbol . From the first cluster “reform , modify , change” they found a wrench image through modify’s concrete sub - words and an image of the evolutionary progression of man from transform , another word within the cluster . They continued on to the “fix , amend , redo” cluster , where they found more tool - related concepts and collected images of a toolbox , saw , and screwdriver - all tools that can be used to reform something physically . From the “new , update , innovative” cluster they found symbols like the “update bell icon” used in social media interfaces , as well as the “cycle refresh button” . Although both of these symbols did not have the tone or gravity they wanted for a blend conveying “police reform” , they collected them anyway , thinking they could be useful for future blends with reform . However in a later cluster “structure , building , framework” they found the sub - word scaffolding and collected multiple images of buildings being constructed or renovated with scaffolding . They were excited by this symbol as its tougher tone and “New Yorkness” fit with the article tone well . Thus , while the team is predominantly seeking a variety of representations for each concept , they do keep in mind the tone of the article when looking for appropriate symbols . 9 . 1 . 4 Combining symbols . To blend two symbols , the team employs a matching strategy . After finding symbols for both police and reform , the team placed the images side - by - side to ideate 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 .

Cover illustrations consisting of two blended symbols for the three articles . The team of student designers found each symbol idea from SymbolFinder and used PowerPoint or Photoshop to create these prototypes . blends between them . Commenting on their overall process , P2 explained “we start by choosing a symbol we like from one concept . Then we match that symbol with one from the other concept , usually based on shape or function . ” They ultimately made 18 initial prototypes , 2 of which are shown in Figure 9 . 10 of these prototypes combined symbols of police with symbols of reform , with the other 8 combining police with symbols of law . Across these 18 prototypes , they used 8 unique symbols of police , which came from 4 different clusters . They combined these police symbols with 8 unique symbols of reform , which came from 5 different clusters . They also used 6 unique symbols of law , which came from 3 clusters . By having multiple diverse symbols , the team is ( 1 ) able to successfully find a match between two concepts with a higher probability and ( 2 ) create a diverse set of prototypes to show their client , using 6 - 8 unique symbols from each concept . Diverse symbols helped the team match symbols by giving them the assets to deal with emerging constraints . For example , the first blend for police + reform , consisted of scaffolding , symbolizing reform , applied to a police badge . The team was excited after finding scaffolding as a symbol for reform , and proceeded to try and match it with a police symbol . They needed something that looked building - like , and the police badge was one of the few symbols that was relatively rectangular and tall ( Figure 9 ) . By having many diverse symbols for police , they were able to meet this shape - constraint . A similar situation occurred when the team blended a symbol of police with a symbol of law . They wanted to find a police symbol to combine with a gavel , a classic symbol of law . They first tried applying stick - shaped symbols like the baton to replace the handle of the gavel . However this blend was not so appealing as the police symbol seemed less prominent in the image . After scanning the police images once more , they found a symbol containing a red and blue siren , which they thought could replace the ends of the gavel . They liked this idea more as they thought the police symbol was more salient , thanks to the red and blue color of the siren , while maintaining 18 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 18 of 1 – 22 .

By allowing the team to find diverse symbols for each concept , SymbolFinder gave them the ability to connect them even when other design constraints emerged . In both cases , when they chose a symbol they liked from one concept , they were able to ideate a blend that made sense shape - wise , tonally , and stylistically . 10 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK In the following section we discuss limitations and future work to improve the system . We also discuss applying SymbolFinder to other visual media . 10 . 1 Emerging vocabulary Currently , SymbolFinder is limited to the associations present in the SWOW dataset . And while the dataset is quite large , this can be a problem when searching for new or esoteric concepts . For example , in the past , the team worked on an article where one of the concepts was COVID - 19 , which did not exist in SWOW . In order to find symbols , the team brainstormed on their own , used Google Image Search , and also tried inputting related terms like virus into SymbolFinder . A solution to this problem could involve extracting related keywords for the new concept from web search results or from a frequently updated knowledge base like Wikipedia . These keywords could then be linked to current entries in the SWOW dataset . By doing so , the new concept would have a set of SWOW associations from which a local semantic network could be created and clustered . 10 . 2 Finding the perfect image While SymbolFinder is effective for finding many diverse representations of an abstract concept , it is less useful for finding a specific image , once a particular representation is chosen . In the case study , after the team came up with an idea for a blend using symbols they found with SymbolFinder , they would sometimes perform a secondary search with Google Images to find a particular version of the symbol . For example , while making the police badge and scaffolding blend ( Figure 9 ) , the designer did not use the images of scaffolding they found with SymbolFinder . After imagining the symbol blend , she had a specific idea for how she wanted the scaffolding to look . She wanted a “consistent background color so it would be easy to remove it” . As well as a removable background , she wanted a 2d image that was neither “super busy” , containing ”overlapping scaffolding” , nor too simple and “unnatural” looking . She ended up scanning many images to find the image she used . As well as finding the perfect image that contains the right visual detail , the team also mentioned another factor in the secondary search was finding images that are free to use . Fundamentally , SymbolFinder is a brainstorming tool , but in the future , we can incorporate tools to help users find particular versions of an image that fits their purpose . 10 . 3 Applying SymbolFinder to other visual media and databases As well as images , SymbolFinder can be slightly altered to search Google for GIFS and videos instead of images . SymbolFinder’s core feature is the clustered local semantic network , which enables users to explore a number of diverse and related contexts associated with a concept . Similarly , though built with Google Images as its image database , SymbolFinder can be applied to any other image database , depending on the user’s needs , such as the Noun Project [ 44 ] , Flickr [ 19 ] , or Shutterstock [ 47 ] . Although these database are already included Google Image Search , users may want to restrict their search to focus on these databases , given their goals . 11 CONCLUSION This paper presents SymbolFinder , an interactive tool that enables users to find diverse symbols for abstract concepts . In our user study we show that users can find significantly more unique symbols 2020 - 09 - 17 15 : 28 . Page 19 of 1 – 22 . 19 U n p u b l i s h e d w o r k i n g d r a f t .

We also conduct a case study showing how SymbolFinder is useful for creating cover illustrations of news articles . In the future , SymbolFinder can be applied to other media types , like GIFs , and other image databases . Also SymbolFinder could include tools to help users find a perfect image after a representation is chosen and expand its word association dataset automatically with new concepts .
