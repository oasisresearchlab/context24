THE STRUCTURE OF LICENSING CONTRACTS * Bharat N . Anand { and Tarun Khanna { Industrial organization theory has explored several issues related to licensing , but empirical analyses are extremely rare . We amass a new and detailed dataset on licensing contracts , and use it to present some simple ‘facts’ concerning licensing behavior . Our analysis reveals robust cross - industries di¡erences in several contractual features , such as exclusivity , cross - licensing , ex - ante versus ex - post technology transfers , and licensing to related versus unrelated parties . We o¡er an interpretation of these facts based on cross - industry variation in the strength of intellectual property rights . i . introduction L icensing is an important phenomenon for several reasons . It is one of only a few signi¢cant methods of technology transfer between ¢rms , and one of the most commonly observed inter - ¢rm contractual agreements . Given the increasing importance of licensing as a tool for managing the intellectual property of ¢rms in ‘high technology’ industries ( Grindley and Teece [ 1997 ] ) , the importance of understanding the economics of licensing seems certain to increase . Further , a better understanding of the structure and motivation behind licensing contracts will surely go a long way toward informing policy issues regarding antitrust enforcement and intellectual property in industries where licensing is common ( Ordover [ 1991 ] ) . Appropriately , then , licensing activity has been the subject of much theoretical inquiry . Empirical analyses , however , that inform the develop - ment of this theory are extremely rare . Our paper aims to bridge this gap (cid:223) BlackwellPublishersLtd . 2000 , 108CowleyRoad , OxfordOX41JF , UK , and350MainStreet , Malden , MA02148 , USA . 103 THE JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS 0022 - 1821 Volume XLVIII March 2000 No . 1 * We would like to thank Ashish Arora , Tim Bresnahan , Alex Galetovic , Alfonso Gambardella , Rebecca Henderson , Ben Hermalin , Jenny Lanjouw , Josh Lerner , Barry Nalebu¡ , Anju Nohria , Sharon Oster , Roni Shachar , the editor ( Severin Borenstein ) , two anonymous referees , and seminar participants at Penn ( Wharton ) , Northwestern ( Kellogg ) , Stanford , Tel - Aviv , Yale , and the Econometric Society Meetings for helpful comments .

Industrial organization theory has explored several issues related to licensing . Particularly well - developed themes include ( i ) the relationship between the choice of number of licensees and the existing and resultant industry structure ( Arrow [ 1962 ] , Kamien and Tauman [ 1984 ] , Katz and Shapiro [ 1986 ] ) , ( ii ) the division of the value created by a licensing agreement between the licensor and licensees ( Kamien and Tauman [ 1986 ] , Gallini and Wright [ 1990 ] ) , ( iii ) the likelihood that ex ante or ex post licensing will occur ( Gallini [ 1984 ] , Gallini and Winter [ 1984 ] , Shapiro [ 1985 ] ) , and the relationship between sequential innovations and licensing strategies ( Green and Scotchmer [ 1994 ] ) . In contrast to this voluminous theoretical literature , empirical analyses of licensing contracts are extremely rare . 1 Two studies , frequently used to motivate a large subset of the theory literature , are early small - sample surveys of licensors and licensees in the US , UK and Canada by Caves et al . [ 1983 ] , and of licensing and patenting practices in the UK by Taylor and Silbertson [ 1973 ] . There are also a few clinical and historical studies of licensing practices in particular industries ( see , e . g . Grindley and Nickerson [ 1996 ] in the chemicals industry and Grindley and Teece [ 1997 ] in the electronics industry ) . To the best of our knowledge , there are no large - sample studies , either cross - industry or industry - speci¢c . Given this lacuna , our primary objective is to present some simple ‘facts’ underlying licensing behavior . A major contribution of this exercise is the amassing of a detailed data set on licensing contracts . The sample of deals we study is drawn from publicly available data from Securities Data Corporation ( SDC ) . In its current form , however , these data proved to be of inadequate quality for our empirical work for several reasons . First , our reading of several hundred summary descriptions of contracts allowed us to identify the most commonly discussed contractual features of interest . However , SDC provides information on only a subset of these features . Second , important parts of the data provided by SDC are inaccurate . We describe our detailed e¡orts to ensure the consistency of the SDC data with other publicly available data sources ; in addition , we supplemented this with hand - collected data on publicly disclosed features of licensing contracts not captured by SDC . While this results in the largest such data source on licensing contracts of which we are aware , it is certainly not comprehensive . However , we draw succor from two facts . First , the distribution of licensing contracts across di¡erent industries is quite 1 Our knowledge of licensing , in particular , is signi¢cantly further behind our empirical understanding of other issues in contracting ( see , for example , Lafontaine and Slade [ 1997 ] for a survey of the econometric evidence on retail contracting ) . 104 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . similar to reports from the afore - mentioned surveys . Second , our focus on cross - industry di¡erences in the structure of these contracts makes the likely lack of comprehensiveness of the data less of an issue . The bulk of licensing contracts are signed in three 2 - digit SIC industries , which we refer to in the paper as Chemicals ( SIC 28 ) , Computers ( SIC 35 ) , and Electronics ( SIC 36 ) . Our analysis identi¢es some strong cross - industry di¡erences in contractual features . We ¢nd robust cross - industry di¡erences in : the incidence of licensing activity ( both in absolute terms and in relation to total alliance activity ) , the proportion of ex - ante contracts , the importance of exclusive contracts ( with and without contractual restrictions that we can measure in the aggregate data ) , the proportion of contracts signed among parties with past relationships , and the incidence of cross - licensings . We discuss explanations for these empirical regularities at the end of the paper . The existing theoretical literature is helpful in explaining some of these cross - industry di¡erences in contract features . However , since many of these models are developed to analyze particular features , it is di⁄cult to reconcile all the regularities within a common framework . In contrast , a theory based simply on cross - industry di¡erences in the strength of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) appears promising in explaining all the observed regularities . In particular , extraneous assump - tions over existing market structure , information asymmetries , or the importance of the technologies being transferred , need not be imposed . We discuss some of the implications of strong versus weak property rights for contract structure . Finally , this discussion suggests that in the development of future theory , it may be useful to consider weak property rights to be a primitive of the contracting environment , rather than as a policy choice variable . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section II describes the construction of the data set . The cross - industry di¡erences in contract features are described in Section III . Section IV discusses possible interpretations of these results . Section V concludes . ii . construction of the dataset The data are drawn from the Strategic Alliance database of Securities Data Company ( SDC ) . The sample universe for most of our analysis is all licensing contracts involving at least one US participant , 2 signed during the period 1990 ^ 93 . 3 Other types of alliances that are covered in the SDC database primarily include joint ventures , R & D agreements , and 2 While these include primarily private ¢rms , there are a handful of university licensors . 3 We also use SDC information on other types of contracts , particularly joint ventures , when we examine cross - contract incidence within industries . the structure of licensing contracts 105 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . marketing agreements , with a small fraction of equipment manufacture and supply agreements . SDC obtains information from publicly available sources , including SEC ¢lings , trade publications and international counterparts , and news and wire sources . Although the database goes back to 1986 , SDC initiated systematic data collection procedures for tracking such deals only in 1989 ; hence , the deal sample prior to 1990 is far from comprehensive . There are 1612 licensing deals tracked over our sample period , with not much aggregate annual variation ( as seen in Table I ) . The data clearly do not track all such deals consummated by US ¢rms over this period , due to inadequate corporate reporting requirements . However , since this database is probably the most comprehensive source of information on such deals , it is ideal for empirical analysis . The possible lack of comprehensiveness of the data is less likely to be of concern in our analysis , since we focus on cross - industry di¡erences in the incidence of contract features . Further , the distribution of deals is similar to that in earlier small - sample studies . For example , Taylor and Silbertson [ 1979 ] focus their e¡orts on the same industries that have a dominant presence in our database . Caves et al . [ 1983 ] note that their sample ranges in ‘an apparently representative fashion across the chemical , electrical and equipment manufacturing industries . ’ Also , a study by McShan et al . [ 1989 ] , based on sixty reports regarding licensing contracts ¢led with the SEC , indicates that two - thirds of the agreements were in areas like pharma - ceutical preparations , toilet preparations , electronic computing equipment , semiconductors , surgical and medical equipment , and ophthalmic goods . SDC provides information on various contract - speci¢c characteristics , including contract type ( i . e . , whether the contract is a joint venture agreement , licensing agreement , marketing agreement , etc . ) , identities of participating ¢rms , the date of the agreement , and the SDC code of the alliance , which may be di¡erent from the SIC codes of the participating ¢rms . Using the Nexis - Lexis database , we supplemented the SDC dataset with information on various deal - speci¢c characteristics described below , and simultaneously checked the accuracy of the SDC data where possible . We were able to ¢nd information on 1365 deals , or about 80 % of the sample ( see Table II ( i ) ) ; only these deals , which we were able to check using this additional data source , are retained in the ¢nal sample used for the analysis . SDC data on contract type is quite accurate . In a few cases , the transfer or exchange of technology in the licensing deal was also accompanied by the setting up of a joint venture for purposes of research or marketing . Since the inclusion of such deals in the analysis does not create any obvious biases , they are retained in the ¢nal sample . SDC information on whether the participating ¢rm is a licensor , licensee , or cross - licensor is missing for 763 deals and is supplemented with Nexis - source information where available . For the other 602 deals , the 106 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 .

SDC classi¢cation of licensor and licensee is always found to be accurate . However , cross - licensings appear to be signi¢cantly overstated ( we are unable to fathom the method behind SDC’s coding , nor did conversations with SDC’s data collection arm prove insightful ) . Our operative criterion for identifying a cross - licensing agreement is that each party was the current or intended provider of some technology to the other , as well as the current or intended recipient of some technology from the other , regardless of whether or not the technology was deemed ‘equal’ enough for no compensating royalties to accompany the agreement . 4 We choose the contractual features to focus on in the following manner . To the extent that publicly available data exist , we ¢rst look for contract features that have been discussed extensively in the theoretical literature . While we are able to code some of these , there are several others that are probably better addressed in an industry - speci¢c study of licensing activity . For example , we are able to obtain information on the exclusivity of transfers , on the extent to which there is cross - licensing , and on whether a contract is signed prior to the development of the technology ( ex - ante licensings ) or not , but we are unable to gather enough information on the form of payment ( royalties versus ¢xed fees ) .

There are two additional points worth noting : ( i ) There were no cross - licensings involving more than two ¢rms . ( ii ) A handful of cross - licensings involved a combination of current and prospective technology transfers . The dual ex - ante / ex - post nature of such agreements is picked up in our coding of other contract - speci¢c attributes ( see below ) . 108 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . which is suggested by the public record , but which has not received any attention in the literature , concerns the identity of the licensee : in particular , whether any past relationships exist between licensor and licensee . Information on contract exclusivity is signi¢cantly understated in the SDC coding . SDC identi¢es about 10 % of the deals in the sample to involve exclusive transfers , whereas we identify more than 30 % involving such allocations . We classify a deal as endowing exclusive rights to the licensee if it is so mentioned in the public announcement following the contract signing . 5 Such deal - speci¢c information is not disclosed in many cases , however ; hence , we probably underestimate the incidence of exclusive transfers . There is no reason , though , to expect that there is any systematic variation across industries in the extent to which such information is disclosed or not . De¢ning exclusivity is not unambiguous . For example , while a licensee could get exclusive rights to a technology for use in a particular market , the scope of the relevant market - for - use may be restricted by additional temporal , product , or geographic restrictions included in the contract . In practise , such restrictions are common . Thus , a worldwide exclusive license for broad use over an unlimited time period is quite di¡erent from an exclusive right to use the technology for ¢ve years in Japan for a well - de¢ned use . In order to distinguish such cases , we additionally coded any mention of such restrictions or clauses in the contract announcement ; 6 by combining this with the information on exclusivity , we are able to construct a ¢ner measure of exclusivity . There may be additional cases , however , where contract restrictions may not be announced , and exclusivity is ( and vice versa ) ; we distinguish such cases where we are unsure about the scope of exclusivity from the others , in the estimation . 7 In order to track the incidence of relationships between ¢rms , we use the following decision rule : the ¢rms in a contract are coded as having a past relationship if : ( 1 ) the announcement mentions that the parties had ‘a 5 For the most part , these publicly available descriptions do not suggest whether an exclusive contract restricts the licensor from using the technology or not . Oster [ 1994 ] , p . 307 , for example , de¢nes exclusivity to include this feature as well . 6 All restrictions that we coded had to do with limitations on product or geographic markets , or were related to time restrictions ( always less than 10 years ) . Prior ¢eld studies ( Taylor and Silbertson [ 1973 ] , Caves et al . [ 1983 ] ) have documented the existence of several other classes of interesting restrictions ( including requirements for technology £owback from licensee to licensor , restrictions on passing on the technology to other parties , minimal acceptability of quality standards and recourse arrangements in the event the licensee fails to meet such standards , etc . ) However , such restrictions do not appear to be reported publicly . An industry - speci¢c study might be better placed to obtain such detailed information . 7 A handful of deals involve both exclusive and non - exclusive transfers : thus , ¢rm A might license one technology to ¢rm B for exclusive use , and a di¡erent technology to ¢rm B for non - exclusive use . We code these as exclusive deals on the grounds that they contain some exclusive components ; excluding such deals , however , does not a¡ect the results . the structure of licensing contracts 109 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . past relationship’ ; or ( 2 ) we could successfully identify any mention of a ( separate ) contractual arrangement involving the participating ¢rms during a two - year window prior to the signing of the current contract ; or ( 3 ) we could identify any other signi¢cant association between the participating ¢rms during the same time window . These latter associations include the following three cases ( cited in declining order of observed frequency ) : ¢rst , one of the parties was either founded by the other , or was a former subsidiary spun o¡ by the other at some time in the past ; 8 second , the licensee is a ¢rm founded as a result of discoveries made under university auspices at some past time , and which are not related to the agreement in question between the university and licensee ; and third , there is common board membership , 9 or the movement of a senior manager from one ¢rm to the other in the past , and who is currently involved in licensing negotiations . We distinguish between relationships of the kinds described above and those in which the current deal is merely a renewal or renegotiation of a past agreement ( i . e . , the underlying technology is the same ) . Further , we distinguish those deals in which the parties were involved in the past via patent litigation , and the current contract is signed as a settlement of such litigation . 10 In all other cases , we are uncertain if the current contract actually represents a new relationship between the ¢rms , or if we are simply unable to track any prior relationship between the ¢rms . As a result , we tend to underestimate the presence of prior relationships between ¢rms . However , as before , there is no reason to expect that there is any systematic variation in tracking this across industries that would bias our results . Limiting our search for past relationships to the two - year period prior to the agreement is not restrictive since virtually all references to past relationships during this window occur in a nine - month period prior to the deal announcement . The information on ¢rm identities and alliance SIC codes is extremely accurate . The description of each of the agreements is always consistent with the two - digit SIC code within which the agreement is classi¢ed by SDC . While we have no systematic way of checking the three - digit SIC classi¢cation assigned by SDC to a particular agreement , we note that : ( a ) the classi¢cations in the three - digit categories that account for the 8 Taylor and Silbertson [ 1973 ] point out that licensing to subsidiaries is fairly common . However , ¢rms may not often use formal agreements to provide know - how to subsidiaries , and technologies are often transferred ‘wherever they are required’ ( page 138 ) . The di¡erent , and altogether less formal , calculus that appears to be employed with regard to subsidiary licensing is consistent with there being no mention of such licensing deals in either SDC data or in Nexis - source descriptions of the identi¢able agreements . 9 Common board membership is identi¢ed only when it is cited in public announcements . 10 Some deals may involve both past relationship in other areas , and litigation over the relevant technology ; hence , these codes are not necessarily mutually exclusive . 110 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . majority of agreements ( see Section III ) appear to us to be accurate , and ( b ) our empirical analysis relies largely on distinctions between licensing agreements at the two - digit level . Variation in contract incidence over time allows us to examine time variation in contract structure , resulting possibly from secular changes in the characteristics of technologies being transferred . SDC data on contract dates are not accurate for a signi¢cant fraction of the deals . In most cases , the extent of inaccuracy is within one to two months . 11 In some cases , the reported data appear to coincide with the date on which the agreement was ¢nally signed ; in other cases , they seem to coincide with the date on which agreement negotiations appear to have begun . In any event , the exact date is not crucial to our current e¡ort , 12 although event study analyses using SDC data would contain fairly serious biases in the absence of such corrections . We attempted to collect additional deal - level information on the nature of the technology . One important feature that we code is the distinction between already - developed technologies and those for which patent protection has been obtained or is pending and ‘prospective’ or ‘ex - ante’ transfers . It is much more di⁄cult to identify the ‘technology cohort’ , i . e . , whether the technology is newly developed or has existed a while . 13 Distinguishing between process and product innovations is also inter - esting , but is extremely di⁄cult to code in a sensible way . In particular , process innovations , generating cost - reductions due to changes in input requirements or improvements in technology or process , almost always generate some product enhancement ( either in attributes , or quality and performance ) , thus making it di⁄cult to separate the two . 14 Most of the information was collected by three di¡erent researchers ( the authors and a research assistant ) , with deals randomly assigned across the three researchers . We checked all the relevant variables in di¡erent parts of the sample for consistency in coding across researchers , primarily by examining summary statistics . Our discomfort with both the ‘new / old technology’ variable and the product - process classi¢cation stems from such an examination . We were also unable to identify with any degree of precision whether the technology represented a marginal versus a 11 SDC also uses a £ag to indicate the perceived accuracy of the alliance data . We have not checked whether this reasonably captures the extent of inaccuracies in the date ¢eld . 12 The only place where the date matters is when we use Compustat size data for participating ¢rms ( in a speci¢cation check for one of the hypotheses ) . As long as the coded data is in the right quarter , there are no measurement errors introduced . Such errors are probably not signi¢cant even in other cases , since there is strong persistence in ¢rm size across quarters . 13 See , for example , Caves et al . [ 1983 ] . 14 See also Clark and Wheelwright [ 1993 ] . the structure of licensing contracts 111 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . fundamental innovation . 15 Finally , although we coded a brief description of the nature of the technology , and any other comments related to the contract structure ( such as equity participations , funding for further technology development , etc . ) , there is not su⁄cient data on these measures to include them in the estimations . We do not use additional ¢rm - level information in most of the analysis below . Where we do , such information is obtained from the Center for Research in Securities Prices ( CRSP ) and Compustat databases , and we discuss the ensuing sample attrition in the relevant section below . iii . empirical analysis In this section , we present the results on inter - industry variation in the incidence and structure of licensing contracts , proceeding sequentially through several contract features . Then , we examine whether , and which , subsets of features tend to be observed together in contracts . III ( i ) . Aggregate Licensing Activity and Ex - ante Transfers The incidence of licensing activity across industries , aggregated at the two - digit SIC level , is given in Table I , and is evenly distributed over the four years 1990 ^ 93 . Almost 80 % of licensing deals occur in three industries : 46 % in Chemicals ( SIC 28 ) , 12 % in Industrial Machinery and Equipment ( SIC 35 ) , and 22 % in Electronic and Electrical Equipment ( SIC 36 ) . Given that these form the core of ‘high technology’ industries , it is not surprising that a substantial fraction of all contracts involving the transfer of knowledge occurs within these industries . Most contracts appears to involve the transfer of a single technology . 16 About half of all deals involve cross - border transfers , with the US participant ( s ) being the licensor in more than two - thirds of such transfers . While the contract descriptions indicate that virtually all licensing contracts involve the transfer of technology , a few cases involve the transfer of know - how . Compared with intellectual property transfers , deals involving the transfer of other intangible assets , such as the rights to a ¢rm’s ‘brand name’ , are rare . 17 For each of these industries , more than two - thirds of licensing activity is concentrated within a single three - digit cluster . For example , 81 . 37 % of all licensings in Chemicals occur in Drugs ( SIC 2830 ) . Drug production 15 Several models distinguish di¡erent results for drastic versus non - drastic innovations , e . g . , Katz and Shapiro [ 1986 ] . 16 A random search of 100 non - cross licensing deals indicated that only two of these involved an exchange of multiple technologies . 17 Most such transfers occur within textiles . 112 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . based on recombinant DNA technology and immunotherapy , including rights to ( the production and process know - how for ) gene therapy , monoclonal antibodies , antisense technologies , and other techniques for protein synthesis , form the basis of many such transfers . Other transfers involve novel drug delivery systems , new therapeutic compounds , or diagnostic tests . The other dominant sub - segments , shown in Table II ( ii ) , are Computers and O⁄ce Equipment ( SIC 3570 ) , Communications Equipment ( SIC 366 ) , Electronic Components and Accessories ( SIC 367 ) , and Surgical and Medical Instruments and Supplies ( SIC 3840 ) . Within SIC 35 , most transfers ( 74 . 68 % ) involve innovations in computer hardware relating to the production of workstations , laptops , personal digital assistants , or other electronic products or software including word - processor code , scanning software , imaging software , graphics design software , tool kit software , font technology software , etc . The bulk of transfers ( 62 . 74 % ) within SIC 36 relate to the manufacturing of integrated circuits and memory technology ( SIC 3670 ) , with another 25 % of transfers based on interconnect , networking , or other telecommunications tech - nologies ( SIC 3660 ) . Finally , most transfers ( 60 % ) within SIC 38 are based on novel non - invasive medical or surgical instruments or products , as well as new diagnostic testing products . Hereafter , we focus on comparisons at the two - digit level , with the industries referred to as Chemicals ( SIC 28 ) , Computers ( SIC 35 ) , Electronics ( SIC 36 ) , and Others .

Licensing deals account for more than one - third of all alliances in Chemicals , but for only 18 % and 24 % in Computers and Electronics respectively . 18 Further , almost 24 % of licensings within Chemicals are signed prior to the development of the technology ( see Table III ( i ) ) ; in many of these , the licensee provides R & D ¢nancing to the licensor in exchange for future rights exclusive or otherwise to the resulting technologies . In contrast , fewer than 6 % of contracts in Computers and Electronics involve ex - ante technology transfers . Apart from incidence , there is also variation in the contractual details of the licensing agreements that are entered into in these industries . We turn to these in the remaining sub - sections . III ( ii ) . Relationships Almost 30 % of all licensing deals ( Table III ( i ) , Column 5 ) are signed between ¢rms having prior relationships ( we also refer to these as ‘related ¢rms’ below ) . Another 2 % of deals represent contract renewals or renegotiated agreements , and about 3 % of deals are signed as part of litigation settlements . Computer and Electronics ¢rms have a higher tendency to contract with related ¢rms ( 39 % and 35 % ) compared with ¢rms in Chemicals ( 28 % ) or other industries ( 23 % ) . Cross - border transfers are also more likely to involve ¢rms with prior relationships ( 34 % , com - pared with 26 % for domestic transfers ; see Table III ( ii ) , Columns 1 ^ 2 ) . For multivariate analysis , we use a simple probit model to analyze the decision to license to a related ¢rm . Covariates include industry and time dummies , a dummy variable indicating cross - border transfers , and another indicator variable for whether the license is over a developed technology or a prospective one ( see Table IV ) . The results from this analysis reveal similar inter - industry di¡erences ( Table IV , Column 1 ) . The incidence of relationships is signi¢cantly higher in Computers and Electronics relative to the other industries . Using the probit coe⁄cients to recover the underlying probabilities , we ¢nd that the probability of licensing between related ¢rms is about 46 % in Computers and 42 % in Electronics , compared with 34 % in Chemicals . 19 While the e¡ects for Computers and Electronics 18 In Anand and Khanna [ 1995 ] , we examine the incidence of joint ventures versus licensing contracts motivated from an underlying managerial choice model . Di¡erences in contract choice across industries are not examined there , however . 19 The estimated probability of observing licensing between related parties in industry j is given by : Z ijt (cid:136) F (cid:133) X ijt b (cid:135) I i y j (cid:134) , where I i are industry dummies with coe⁄cients g j and X ijt denotes the mean values of the other covariates ( with coe⁄cient vector b ) . 114 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 .

Finally , transfers to related ¢rms in cross - border transfers is greater by 8 % relative to domestic transfers . The incidence of relationships may be correlated with ¢rm age . For example , older ¢rms are more likely to have had past relationships simply by virtue of their age . 20 If the age distribution of ¢rms varies systemati - cally across industries , this may explain the observed inter - industry di¡erences . In order to correct for this potential bias , we include ¢rm size as a proxy for the age of a ¢rm . Since data on ¢rm sizes are obtained from Compustat ( which tracks public corporations only ) , information on ¢rm size is obtained for only 1171 ¢rms . Indeed , sample attrition in Chemicals is slightly greater than for the other industries ( see Table II ( i ) , rows 3 ^ 4 ) , Table III ( ii ) Summary Statistics ( cont’d . ) Contract feature Domes1 Int’l2 Total3 Prospectivetechnologies 93 13 . 54 % 89 13 . 67 % 182 13 . 60 % Relationships ( N = 1365 ) * Prior relationship 176 26 . 43 % 209 34 . 04 % 385 30 . 08 % Other 490 73 . 57 % 405 65 . 96 % 895 69 . 92 % Exclusive Worldwide exclusive 105 15 . 20 % 44 6 . 68 % 149 11 . 04 % Other exclusive 155 22 . 43 % 190 28 . 83 % 345 25 . 56 % Unknown 330 47 . 76 % 284 43 . 10 % 614 45 . 48 % Non - exclusive 101 14 . 62 % 141 21 . 40 % 242 17 . 93 % Restrictions * * 209 30 . 16 % 292 44 . 44 % 501 37 . 11 % Cross - Licensing 84 11 . 72 % 91 13 . 58 % 175 12 . 62 % Notes : As for Table III ( i ) . ‘Domes’ refers to deals in which all participating ¢rms are US ¢rms ; all other deals are ‘Int’l’ . 20 This follows even if the conditional probability of forming relationships does not vary with age . 116 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 .

L is log - likelihood ; N is number of observations . the structure of licensing contracts 117 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . consistent with the hypothesis that industry e¡ects may re£ect unobserved size di¡erences . 21 However , for this smaller sample , both the aggregate incidence of relationships and cross - tabulations of the variation in relationships across industries are very similar to the earlier ¢gures ( Table III ( i ) ) , suggesting that the industry e¡ects are robust . This is con¢rmed in the multivariate probit estimates where , even after controlling for ¢rm size ( averaged over ¢rms in a given deal ) , we ¢nd that inter - industry di¡erences are both signi¢cant and similar to the earlier estimates . 22 Since we can identify relationships between ¢rms only when explicit mention is made of these in the public disclosures ( up to two years prior to the contract date ) , the dependent variable tracking the incidence of relationships will be misclassi¢ed in general . Consequently , the parameter estimates including the industry e¡ects will be downward - biased . Since we do not expect the extent of misclassi¢cation to vary systematically across industries , however , the inter - industry di¡erences will not be biased . In the appendix , we explicitly examine the sensitivity of our results to the degree of misclassi¢cation , and we ¢nd that our results are quite robust . III ( iii ) . Exclusive Rights and Accompanying Restrictions 37 % of all contracts involve some form of exclusive rights being allocated to the licensee ( see Table III ( i ) ) . In 11 % of deals , licensees get worldwide exclusive rights to the use of the technology , while exclusivity within a restricted geographic domain is granted in another 26 % of transfers . In 45 % of contracts , we cannot ascertain the type of exclusive rights granted . About 18 % of contracts assign non - exclusive use to the licensee . The incidence of exclusivity varies considerably across industries . More than half of all transfers in Chemicals involve some exclusivity clause , with worldwide exclusivity being granted in almost 40 % of these . Conversely , only 12 % of contracts are explicitly non - exclusive . Exclusive transfers are much less common in Computers ( 18 % ) and Electronics ( 16 % ) , but are frequent in the other industries ( 38 % ) . Similarly , the fraction of transfers 21 The median size of ¢rms involved in licensing deals in Chemicals is lower than the 25th size percentile in Computers , which is comparable to that in Electronics . The di¡erences at the 3 - digit SIC level are even more striking : the median size in SIC 3570 ( Computers ) and 3670 ( Semiconductors ) exceeds the 75th percentile in Chemicals . Thus , while many ¢rms in Chemicals are small and specialize in research , a large fraction of innovations in other industries occur within larger ¢rms . 22 If we include only those deals on which we have data on all participating ¢rms , the coe⁄cient estimates are similar ( although standard errors are larger , given the smaller sample size ) . 118 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . that are non - exclusive is greater than 25 % in Computers and Electronics , compared with about 10 % in the other industries . 23 Fewer exclusive transfers are observed in cross - border transfers than in domestic transfers ( 35 % versus 38 % respectively ; Table III ( ii ) , Columns 1 ^ 2 ) ; however , these di¡erences are not signi¢cant . Similarly , the probability of exclusive transfers is slightly higher when the licensee is a US ¢rm ( 40 % ) relative to when it is a non - US ¢rm ( 35 % ) ( these ¢gures are not shown in the table ) . For multivariate estimation , we construct an ordinal dependent variable , y eijt , that tracks the incidence of exclusivity as follows : y eijt (cid:136) 3 for contracts involving worldwide exclusive transfers , y eijt (cid:136) 2 for contracts involving exclusive transfers which are non - classi¢able further , y eijt (cid:136) 1 for contracts whose announcements contain no information on exclusivity , and y eijt (cid:136) 0 for non - exclusive transfers . Estimation then proceeds using a standard ordered probit speci¢cation : p (cid:133) y eijt (cid:136) n (cid:134) (cid:136) p (cid:133) k n (cid:255) 1 < X ijt b (cid:135) e eijt < k n (cid:134) where n 2 f 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 g ; k j de¢ne the cuto¡ parameters for each category , with k 0 (cid:136) (cid:255)1 , and k N (cid:136) 1 ; and X ijt refers to contract - level character - istics as before , including industry dummies . e eijt is assumed to be normally distributed . Inter - industry di¡erences are highly signi¢cant after controlling for other contract - level di¡erences ( Table IV , Column 3 ) . The probability of observing worldwide exclusive contracts in Chemicals is approximately 17 % , compared with 4 % and 3 % in Computers and Electronics respectively , which are also signi¢cantly lower than in other industries ( 11 % ) . Similarly , non - exclusive contracts are much more likely to be observed in Computers and Electronics ( 31 % and 33 % respectively ) . All these di¡erences between industries ( except between SICs 35 and 36 ) are signi¢cant at the 1 % level . The probability of observing exclusive contracts in cross - border transfers is 41 % , compared with 33 % for domestic transfers , similar to the earlier univariate estimates . Exclusive rights are also much more likely to be allocated to the licensee for prospective technologies ( 59 % , versus 34 % for developed technologies ) . Contracts may include various restrictions on the licensee’s use of a technology . Thus , the degree of exclusivity actually granted to the licensee 23 For the results to be materially a¡ected by unclassi¢able observations on exclusivity , there would have to be fairly dramatic inter - industry di¡erences in the extent of unreported exclusive agreements . As an example , compare SIC 28 and SIC 35 in Table III . Suppose that the fraction of unreported exclusive agreements in SIC 28 is the same as the fraction of reported exclusive agreements . One can calculate that , for the true incidence of exclusive agreements in these two industries to be identical , one would need 116 % of the unreported agreements in SIC 35 to be exclusive . the structure of licensing contracts 119 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . may depend on the scope of these restrictions . About 37 % of contracts make explicit mention of such restrictions , concerning ¢eld of use , geographic domain , or the contract length . More restrictions are observed in transfers in Chemicals ( 41 % ) compared with Computers and Electronics ( about 30 % ) . We use this information on contract restrictions in the data to construct a more re¢ned measure of exclusivity as follows : exclusive rights with no mention of accompanying restrictions are classi¢ed as ‘most exclusive’ (cid:133) y e 0 ijt (cid:136) 3 (cid:134) followed by contracts in which exclusive rights are granted with accompanying restrictions (cid:133) y e 0 ijt (cid:136) 2 (cid:134) . 24 Non - exclusive con - tracts for which there is no mention of other restrictions are classi¢ed as less exclusive than either of these cases (cid:133) y e 0 ijt (cid:136) 1 (cid:134) . Finally , non - exclusive contracts with restrictions imposed on the licensee are classi¢ed as the ‘least exclusive’ contracts (cid:133) y e 0 ijt (cid:136) 0 (cid:134) . The distribution of this ordered variable across industries , shown in Table III ( i ) , con¢rms the earlier inter - industry di¡erences . For example , about two - thirds of exclusive transfers within Computers contain accom - panying contract restrictions , compared with less than half in Chemicals . Similar inter - industry di¡erences are observed after controlling for other contract - level characteristics ( Table IV , Column 4 ) . The probability of the licensee being granted ‘most exclusive’ rights is about 25 % in Chemicals , versus 10 % in Computers and Electronics ; these di¡erences are signi¢cant at the 1 % level . Conversely , the probability of observing ‘most restrictive’ transfers is more than 26 % in Computers and Electronics , compared with 11 % in Chemicals . 25 Similarly , exclusive rights are more likely to be allocated for prospective technologies and in domestic transfers . III ( iv ) . Cross - Licensings About 13 % of all transfers are cross - licensings , many of which occur as part of a patent litigation settlement . However , cross - licensings are much more commonly observed in Electronics ( 20 % ) , where most of these deals concern semiconductor technologies . In other industries , the incidence of cross - licensings is much lower ( about 10 % ) . In addition , cross - licensings are more likely to be observed for the transfer of technologies that are not yet developed ( 21 % , versus 12 % for ex - post transfers ) . While the incidence of cross - licensings in domestic transfers is slightly lower than in cross - border transfers , the di¡erence is not signi¢cant . Similar results obtain after controlling for other contract characteristics ( Table IV , Column 5 ) . 24 We do not distinguish between exclusive worldwide transfers and other exclusive transfers here . 25 We cannot directly test the appropriateness of the ordering of the dependent variable by comparing these estimates to those from an unordered ( multinational ) probit estimation , since the two models are non - nested . 120 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . III ( v ) . The Joint Incidence of Contract Features Thus far , we have considered the incidence of contract features indi - vidually . However , it may be that a given feature is likely to be observed only together with other particular ones in the licensing contract , e . g . , it may be possible that a licensor is more inclined to o¡er an exclusive contract to a related party than an unrelated one . Ignoring this jointness in the incidence of various features may lead us to overstate the cross - industry di¡erences described above , to the extent that the variety of di¡erences in contract structure outlined there are simply parts of the same coin . To uncover such ‘decision dependence’ , we examine the joint incidence of the various contractual features(cid:246)exclusivity , relatedness of partners , and cross - licensing here . Doing so also allows us to infer the extent to which these features are complements or substitutes in the licensing process . We assume the following simple behavioral structure for these contracting decisions d ei ; d ri , and d ci , by licensor i at time t : d rit (cid:136) 1 if X it b r (cid:135) e rit > 0 0 otherwise (cid:26) d eit (cid:136) 1 if X it b e (cid:135) e eit > 0 0 otherwise (cid:26) d cit (cid:136) 1 if X it b c (cid:135) e cit > 0 0 otherwise (cid:26) where the joint distribution of the unobserved components , f (cid:133) e rit ; e eit ; e cit (cid:134) , is assumed to be trivariate normal with correlation matrix G , where : G (cid:136) 1 r re r rc r re 1 r ec r rc r ec 1 2 4 3 5 r re is the correlation coe⁄cient between d rit and d eit . This correlation may re£ect either jointness in the decision to allocate exclusive rights and license to a related party , or may re£ect the presence of unobserved factors that a¡ect both decisions . r rc and r ec are similarly de¢ned for the other pairs of variables . The joint probability of observing these contract features is therefore given by : p (cid:133) d rit (cid:136) 1 ; d eit (cid:136) 1 ; d cit (cid:136) 1 (cid:134) (cid:136) p (cid:133) e rit < X it b r ; e eit < X it b e ; e cit < X it b c (cid:134) (cid:136) (cid:133) X i b r (cid:255)1 (cid:133) X i b e (cid:255)1 (cid:133) X i b c (cid:255)1 f (cid:133) e rit ; e eit ; e cit ; G (cid:134) The likelihood function in turn is then given by : the structure of licensing contracts 121 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . l (cid:136) Y i (cid:18) X j X k X l p (cid:133) d rit (cid:136) j ; d eit (cid:136) k ; d cit (cid:136) l (cid:134) (cid:19) where j ; k ; l 2 f 0 ; 1 g . 26 The results of this estimation are shown in Table V .

The correlation in decisions is given by the matrix G . * refers to parameter signi¢cance at 10 % level ; * * refers to signi¢cance at 5 % level . 26 The usual restrictions are imposed on G in order to ensure that it is positive de¢nite ; see Greene [ 1997 ] . The papers in the November 1994 symposium on multivariate probit models in the Review of Economics and Statistics also highlight the di⁄culty in formulating these restrictions explicitly for T - variate problems with more than three dependent variables . 122 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . that these decisions are made independently of each other . However , our estimate of r rc is (cid:255) 0 . 396 , and , signi¢cant at the 1 % level , implying that cross - licensings tend to occur more frequently between unrelated parties . This result accords with intuition as well , since cross - licensing deals are often the result of litigation which is presumably less likely to be observed if the contracting parties have ongoing relationships . Thus , the decision to cross - license appears not to be independent of whether the two parties have existing relationships or not . The cross - industry di¡erences in contract features are similar to those obtained earlier , in many cases even more pronounced than before . 27 The average incidence of related - party licensings and non - exclusive contracts is still much higher in Electronics and Computers , and signi¢cantly lower in Chemicals , than in other industries . Similarly , cross - licensings are on average much more likely to be observed in Electronics . Thus , even after correcting for possible complementarities and substitutabilities between contract features at the deal level , the industry e¡ects are robust , pointing to the fact that each of these inter - industry di¡erences in contract features stem from industry - speci¢c characteristics rather than common unobserved factors or ‘decision - dependence’ at the level of the deal . iv . discussion In this section , we attempt to explain the cross - industry di¡erences in the incidence of contractual features . We ¢rst draw on the existing theoretical literature to interpret our ¢ndings . The literature is suggestive of possible explanations for some contractual features , though no direct attempts to test these theories exist . We also propose an alternative explanation , based on cross - industry variation in the strength of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) , that is consistent with all the empirical regularities identi¢ed above . Finally , we contrast this explanation with others in the existing literature . Some of the contractual features that we have analyzed(cid:246)the choice of ex - ante versus ex - post licensings , the rationale for exclusive contracts , and the incidence of cross - licensing transfers(cid:246)have received attention in various studies . Gallini and Winter [ 1985 ] , for example , provide a rationale for ex - ante licensings : ¢rms engaged in research activities might choose to prospectively license their future discovery to potential rivals who are considering similar research . The softening in R & D competition that otherwise results might outweigh the costs of creating a potential 27 The correlation coe⁄cients in G are identi¢ed by the variation in the contract - level joint incidence of the contract features . The industry e¡ects are identi¢ed by aggregate - level di¡erences in the incidence of the various contract features across industries . Thus , a higher aggregate incidence of relationships and non - exclusivity in Computers , for example , need not provide any information about the correlation of these variables at the level of each deal . the structure of licensing contracts 123 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . competitor . The focus of their study is not on explaining cross - industry di¡erences in the incidence of ex ante licensing such as those we uncover . Hence , absent a study that focuses on the development of measures of R & D intensity , it is di⁄cult to tell whether cross - industry variations in the need to mitigate the threat from potential rivals explain the variations in the proportions of ex ante licensing that we observe . The rationale for exclusive contracts has been widely explored as well . 28 In one of the early studies , Katz and Shapiro [ 1986 ] argue that comple - mentarities in consumption may lead ¢rms to license technologies non - exclusively , with the aim of ‘setting the standard’ early on . This explanation may be promising as well in explaining the higher incidence of exclusive contracts in Chemicals , since fewer such network externalities exist there relative to the computer and electronics industries . As an example that highlights the importance of such externalities in the other industries , Ordover [ 1991 : pp . 50 ] cites the case of the workstation manufacturer , Sun Microsystems , widely licensing its workstation tech - nologies to aid in its being accepted as a standard . Studies on cross - licensings have argued that these are more likely to be observed in industries where technological change is cumulative . The logic is that ¢rms , recognizing that each of their research programs builds on the intellectual property of other ¢rms , will cross - license to each other in an attempt to avoid mutual disruption of research activity . Grindley and Teece [ 1997 ] , for example , opine that the ‘strongest examples of cumulative systems technologies are in electronics , including semicon - ductors and computers’ ( Page 10 ) . This might explain the lower incidence of cross - licensings in Chemicals relative to Computers and Electronics . 29 Thus , there exist plausible explanations for the observed cross - industry variation in ex ante licensings , exclusive licensings , and cross - licensings , although the explanations for each of these contract features rely on very di¡erent strategic incentives . Much less has been said on the issues of the aggregate incidence of licensing activity and of related - party transfers . It is not di⁄cult , however , to posit market - structure based explanations for each of these as well . For example , di¡erences in the size distribution of ¢rms across industries might explain di¡erences in the propensity to license exclusively(cid:246)ceteris paribus , an exclusive license might o¡er greater dissemination of a licensor’s innovation in an industry dominated by a large downstream ¢rm than in a more fragmented industry . However , a simple analysis of data on market structure across the various industries 28 See , for example , Shapiro [ 1985 ] . 29 Cross - licensings have also been studied in Fershtman and Kamien [ 1992 ] , where the focus is on understanding the e¡ects of ex post cross - licensing on ex ante incentives to conduct research . Eswaran [ 1994 ] studies cross - licensing as a collusive mechanism in a repeated game setting . 124 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . suggests that inter - industry di¡erences in exclusivity are not being driven by di¡erences in industry concentration . 30 As another example , it could be that there are simply more existing relationships in general between ¢rms in Computers and in Electronics than in Chemicals ; then , the ¢nding of a greater incidence of licensings to related parties in Computers and in Electronics would simply re£ect the ambient extent of relationships in these industries . While these explanations are plausible , they rely in each case on particular assumptions concerning market structure which , ultimately , is endogenously determined as well . One promising approach that may explain all the empirical regularities described above starts from the observation that the strength of intellectual property rights varies substantially across industries . In industries where property rights are weak , ¢rms are likely to structure contracts and relationships to guard against opportunism ( Williamson [ 1975 ] ) . 31 The observed pattern of contracts is then found to closely re£ect the predictions that are obtained from this framework . In contrast to some of the previously mentioned models , this approach requires assumptions only on technological primitives ; in particular , no assumptions need be made on the nature of demand , on market structure , or on the nature of technological advance . Moreover , a large body of evidence provides su⁄cient basis for the assumptions concerning the di¡erences in the strength of property rights across industries . A cumulative body of evidence shows that in many industries(cid:246) particularly computers and electronics(cid:246)patents often fail to ensure that the patent - holder appropriates the gains from her innovation , whereas in others such as Chemicals patent protection is much stronger . Some scholars have treated the strength of intellectual property rights to be a policy choice variable . 32 However , this literature does not provide any guidance about how this choice varies , or should vary , across industries . 30 Concentration ratios appear to be , if anything , higher in industries which exhibit a higher incidence of non - exclusive licensings . The data we used to construct Her¢ndahl indices for each of the two - and three - digit industries which account for most licensing activity were ¢rm - level sales data for all publicly traded ¢rms within these industries in 1993 ( obtained from Compustat ) . These indices are 0 . 07 in SIC 283 , 0 . 18 in SIC 357 , 0 . 27 in SIC 366 , and 0 . 08 in SIC 367 ; C - 10 ratios across these industries are more similar : 80 % in SIC 283 , 79 % in SIC 357 , 79 % in SIC 366 , and 65 % in SIC 367 . These data suggest that di¡erences in industry concentration do not appear to be driving the variation in exclusivity . 31 Anton and Yao [ 1994 ] develop a model to consider the e¡ects of weak property rights on a licensor’s ability to appropriate surplus from an innovation . For a survey of empirical analyses of how opportunism is constrained by vertical integration , franchises , informal contracts , marketing relationships , and other hybrid contracts , see Shelanski and Klein [ 1995 ] ; licensing is conspicuous by its absence in this review essay . 32 For example , see the literature on the positive and normative consequences of the choice of patent length and breadth , including Gilbert and Shapiro [ 1990 ] , Klemperer [ 1990 ] , Scotchmer and Green [ 1990 ] , Gallini [ 1992 ] , Green and Scotchmer [ 1995 ] , and Chang [ 1995 ] . Lerner [ 1994 ] provides an empirical analysis on the e¡ects of patent scope on ¢rm value . the structure of licensing contracts 125 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . An alternative reason for weak IPRs is that it is di⁄cult to clearly specify the content and boundaries of knowledge and other intangible assets . 33 This has two implications . First , it makes it di⁄cult to prevent others from cheating by imitating the production of the asset ex - post . Second , property rights themselves will be hard to de¢ne since it is di⁄cult to specify what the underlying asset is . In such cases , contracts designed to prevent cheating by others in the form of either patents or decentralized agreements between ¢rms will be fundamentally incomplete . Thus , it is sensible to consider weak IPRs a consequence of bounded rationality rather than purely of intentional design . Patenting activity o¡ers tangible evidence of the ambiguity in description of technologies . Numerous judgement calls have to be made by the Patent O⁄ce regarding the speci¢cation and claims of each appli - cation . Merges and Nelson [ 1990 , p . 841 ] point out that ‘the legal principles and objective evidence often leave considerable room for discretion’ , both in Patent O⁄ce decisions involving the scope of patents and in the litigation that often accompanies a patentee’s allegations that her patent has been infringed upon . There is substantial evidence to indicate that the extent of ambiguity , and the resulting problems associ - ated with contracting over technologies , di¡ers across technologies some technologies are more easily described than others . In particular , there are substantial di¡erences across the three industries(cid:246)Chemicals , Computers , and Electronics(cid:246)which account for a disproportionate share of licensing activity . 34 IV ( i ) . Evidence on Cross - Industry Di¡erences in the Strength of Property Rights Several authors emphasize that a number of common elements distinguish the entire corpus of activity in chemicals from other industries . 35 In particular , the rise of polymer chemistry , advances in chemical engineering , and the advent of recombinant DNA technology have made it much easier to specify and communicate technological know - how in this industry than it used to be , or currently is in a number of other industries . Pharmaceutical patents , in particular , can be made very strong . Moreover , since a slight change in the underlying gene sequence of a protein can result in very di¡erent functions , it is very di⁄cult , for example , to invent around a patent on a drug . It is also possible to patent particular molecules , building blocks for innovations ( such as enzymes , proteins , hormones ) , and drug delivery 33 See Feinstein and Stein [ 1988 ] and Trebilcock [ 1986 ] for a discussion . 34 Merges and Nelson [ 1990 ] provide several examples that illustrate some of these issues . 35 See , for example , Landau and Rosenberg [ 1992 ] , and Arora and Gambardella [ 1996 ] . 126 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . systems . Levin et al . [ 1987 , p . 798 ] ¢nd that patents are signi¢cantly stronger in chemicals than in semiconductors . These results are also borne out by earlier work by Scherer et al . [ 1959 ] , Taylor and Silbertson [ 1973 ] , Wilson [ 1975 ] , Mans¢eld [ 1986 ] , and by more recent survey evidence provided by Cohen et al . [ 1996 ] . The electronics industry is markedly di¡erent from chemicals . Levin et al . [ 1982 , p . 80 ] indicate that , while certain innovations can be patented in semiconductors , ‘what appears impossible to patent is the actual physical layout of an integrated circuit of even moderate complexity . The principal reason for this is the di⁄culty of rendering a full verbal description of the circuit layout . ’ The ine¡ectiveness of patent protection has resulted in substantial imitation around other ¢rms’ innovations , as well as a well - established ‘reverse engineering’ industry ( Levin et al . [ 1982 , p . 81 ] ) . Firms , however , do not sue others for infringement of their patents because they know they are equally likely to be infringing on other ¢rms’ patents in the future , a situation that Von Hippel [ 1988 ] cites a manager describing as a ‘Mexican stando¡ . ’ In contrast to these industries , computer software has been protected until recently by copyright law . Copyright attaches only to an expression of an idea , not the idea itself , making it considerably easier to invent around these rights . Another important feature of copyright law , distinct from patent law , is that a ¢rm’s copyright is not held to be infringed if another ¢rm independently creates the article in question . Moreover , since there is no process of application or ‘de¢nition of claims , the scope of copyright protection is ultimately de¢ned by litigation’ ( Besen and Raskind [ 1991 , p . 11 ] ) . There is much debate in the software industry about the novelty surrounding a piece of software ( Landes and Posner [ 1989 ] ) ; moreover , the industry appears to condone the borrowing of ideas ( Samuelson and Glushko [ 1989 , p . 136 ^ 37 ] ) , and court rulings about the scope of protection have varied over time ( Dam [ 1995 ] ) . 36 As such , the protection a¡orded by copyright law is not as strong as that a¡orded by patent law . Thus , the ability to appropriate the gains from innovation di¡ers systematically across industries , and appears closely linked to the ability to clearly articulate the know - how embodied in the underlying technologies . In chemicals , articulating such information is easy , hence contracts specifying the limits to its use can be more easily designed . In 36 Uncertainty about how legal rulings on intellectual property cases will be resolved may also therefore be a cause of weak property rights . One of the important causes of such uncertainty , however , is the lack of precision in knowhow about a ¢eld , or in specifying the boundaries of legal claims over knowledge . In practise , it would appear di⁄cult to disentangle uncertainty emanating from the legal regime from uncertainty emanating from the state of knowhow in a particular ¢eld . the structure of licensing contracts 127 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . Electronics and Computers , however , information is highly context - dependent and cannot be crystallized to ‘abstract generalizations’ ( Arora and Gambardella [ 1994 ] ) ; hence , contracting on this information is also more di⁄cult . IV ( ii ) . Implications for the Structure of Licensing Contracts and Relationships We now turn to exploring the implications of such cross - industry di¡erences for the structure of licensing contracts . We consider each of the features in Section III in turn . Incidence of licensing contracts . For weakly protected technologies , licensing is likely to be less desirable since there is always the possibility that the licensee will be able to invent around the technology ex post and renege on the terms of the agreement . As such , the bene¢ts of licensing decrease relative to commercializing the technology in - house and relative to pursuing other means of inter - ¢rm technology transfer ( e . g . joint ventures ) , where the disclosure of information may be better controlled by the researcher Ordover [ 1991 , p . 50 ] . For the same reason , joint ventures should be more likely to occur in industries with weak IPRs to the extent that it is easier to monitor and control the activities of partners in such arrangements than via arms - length licensing contracts . Hence , both the aggregate incidence of licensing activity , as well as the ratio of licenses to joint ventures ( i . e . , the relative incidence ) is likely to be greater when property rights over technologies are strong , ceteris paribus . One might expect the aggregate incidence of licensing activity to increase in the number of ¢rms in the industry . Indeed , a simple count of the number of publicly traded ¢rms in the various industries suggests that such a relation , albeit weak , does exist . 37 However , since the boundaries of ¢rms ( hence , the number of ¢rms in the aggregate ) are likely to be in£uenced by the strength of property rights as well ( see Anand and Galetovic [ 1998 ] for a formal analysis ) , this relation is also consistent with the property rights - based explanation posited here . Ex - ante versus ex - post licensing . Firms may also license prospective technologies in exchange for funding of its research program . The value of such ‘ex - ante’ contracts is lower when property rights over future technologies are weak , as the investing ¢rm then e¡ectively ¢nances the development of technologies without obtaining any signi¢cant advantage 37 There are 289 such ¢rms in SIC 283 , 231 in SIC 357 , 166 in SIC 366 , and 175 in SIC 367 . The numbers across two - digit SIC industries are much more similar to each other ( 465 in SIC 28 , 490 in SIC 35 , and 499 in SIC 36 ) . 128 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . over its rivals . We should therefore expect that licensing of prospective technologies is more common when IPRs are strong , ceteris paribus . Contracts between related versus unrelated parties . Weak IPRs over the technology being contracted upon opens the parties up to the possibility of contractual hazards . However , ¢rms are less likely to renege on the terms of an agreement if there is the possibility of future sanction . Such sanctions are much easier to impose if other relationships between the contracting parties exist . In contrast , in situations where IPRs are strong , such contractual hazards are less important , and the prediction is that the licensor is less likely to choose a related party as a licensee . Exclusive versus non - exclusive contracts . When IPRs surrounding the technology being contracted upon are weak , exclusive contracts are unlikely to e¡ectively restrict access to the technology to only licensed parties , since unlicensed parties will be able to invent around the technology ex post . In contrast , when IPRs are strong , exclusive contracts can meaningfully guarantee exclusivity to the licensee . Thus , in situations of weak IPRs , non - exclusive contracts may reduce the potential for cheating by co - opting the would - be patent infringers . 38 This suggests that the proportion of exclusive contracts should be higher in Chemicals than in Computers and in Electronics , consistent with our analysis of licensing agreements ( both with and without associated contractual restrictions ) . 39 Cross - licensings . When IPRs are weak , ¢rms have strong incentives to imitate around rivals’ patents . Cross - licensing agreements(cid:246)where each participating ¢rm is a transferor and recipient of a technology(cid:246)are then e⁄cient contracting arrangements , since they provide access to each other’s technologies while precluding the need for each ¢rm to incur costs of reverse engineering . This suggests that we should see a lower proportion 38 A technology that is well - protected is akin to a ‘drastic’ innovation , since non - licensed ¢rms may face a signi¢cant cost disadvantage relative to licensees . In this case , an exclusive contract mitigates downstream competition and increases the surplus accruing to licensees , and ultimately to the licensor . Thus , the result in the text can also be obtained by a simple reinterpretation of existing models . We are grateful to Mike Whinston for this observation . 39 If each technology exchange in a non - exclusive contract is counted as a separate license , this would tend to bias the statistics on aggregate licensing activity . This bias tends to work in a direction that favors our IPR interpretation of cross - industry di¡erences , however . In particular , since this bias would tend to overstate the aggregate amount of licensing activity in industries where non - exclusive contracts are common(cid:246)such as Computers and Electronics(cid:246)our results which report that the aggregate number of licenses is increasing with the strength of the IPR regime are even stronger . the structure of licensing contracts 129 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . of cross - licenses in Chemicals , where IPR are relatively strong , than in Computers and in Electronics , where IPR are weaker . 40 While we do not have reliable data on the payment structure agreed to in these licensing contracts , it is important to note that these may o¡er an additional instrument to the licensor to circumvent some of the problems posed by weak property rights . For example , to make it less attractive for the licensee to invent around a patent , a licensor might lower the prices ( through a combination of changes to the ¢xed fees and royalty payments ) , thereby increasing the possibility that a licensing contract will be acceptable to both parties , also thereby a¡ecting the aggregate incidence of licenses in the industry in question . While our data cannot speak to this issue directly , one interpretation of our results is that pricing policies do not adequately substitute for other changes in the contract structure that licensors might impose ( such as exclusivity clauses , partner identity , restrictions , cross - licensing , and timing of technology transfer ) . To summarize , when IPR are weak , one should see more reliance on non - market transactions , i . e . , fewer licensings . Conditional on licensing , one should also see ¢ner restrictions on the contract in such cases , and a move away from arms - length contracting with unrelated parties . Although it is di⁄cult to identify the IPR explanation from others in the absence of ¢ner measures of the strength of property rights , the results detailed in Section III are consistent with each of the predictions outlined here , pointing towards the merit of such an explanation . However , it would be useful to explore each of the predictions outlined above more formally . The discussion here points towards the development of theory that focuses more explicitly on the role of property rights on the structure of technology transfers . In particular , the strength of property rights may be an important technological primitive in such models . v . conclusion In this paper , our econometric analysis of a uniquely created dataset has allowed us to assemble some ‘facts’ regarding licensing contracts . We show that licensing activity is concentrated in three 2 - digit SIC industries : Chemicals ( SIC 28 ) , Electronics ( SIC 35 ) and Computers ( SIC 36 ) . Further , conditional on licensing , we discuss the incidence of several important features of such contracts . 40 In a similar vein , Ordover [ 1991 , p . 48 ] suggests that when the patent regime provides only narrow patent protection , so that the value of a patent is greatly diminished , there is a greater incentive to cross - license . 130 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . Licensing activity is most important in the Chemicals , Computers , and Electronics industries . Within these , the incidence of licensing activity(cid:246)relative to joint ventures and other alliances(cid:246)is highest in Chemicals . This industry is also characterized by a much higher fraction of exclusive transfers between ¢rms . Many of these grant worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights to the licensee as well ; even when this is not observed , relatively fewer restrictions in the contract are observed in chemical licensings compared with transfers in the other industries . Licensing contracts in the Computer and Electronics industries are more likely to be signed with ¢rms with whom the licensor has prior relationships , established either through alliance activity , common board membership , or personnel histories . Further , contracts in these industries are usually signed only after completion of the research and development phase . In contrast , a signi¢cant fraction of licensings in Chemicals represent transfers of rights over prospective technologies ; many of these , in turn , represent ¢nancing arrangements with potential downstream users of the innovation . Finally , the Computer and Electronics industries also witness the largest fraction of cross - licensing agreements , of which an important fraction represent the outcome of litigation settlements between the parties . The establishment of these robust di¡erences across industries raises many interesting questions . What explains these inter - industry di¡erences in licensing activity ? To what extent do these re£ect underlying di¡erences in the organization of research and development activities ? How di¡erent is the value created in these alliances across industries ? What are the implications of these ¢ndings for antitrust policy towards licensings ? One explanation for these patterns that we have explored centers on the di¡erences in appropriability across industries . In particular , weak property rights over technologies in the Computer and Electronics industries may lead ¢rms to structure contracts so as to circumscribe potential imitation . Some of the implications for contract design were discussed in Section IV ; it would be useful to develop these more formally , with a view to understanding further the role of property rights on the structure of alliances in high - technology industries . Finally , if property rights are signi¢cantly di¡erent across industries , it may be sensible to view the strength of these rights as a primitive of the contracting environment . Alternatively , it may be worth revisiting the now common assumption in many studies that the scope of intellectual property rights is a policy choice variable . ACCEPTED JANUARY 1999 the structure of licensing contracts 131 (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . appendix A . Correcting for Misclassi¢cation in the Coding of Relationships We examine the sensitivity of estimated industry e¡ects to misclassi¢cation of the incidence of relationships . 41 In particular , we assume that we are able to identify the existence of prior relationships between transacting ¢rms with probability (cid:133) 1 (cid:255) y (cid:134) ( given that such relationships exist ) , where y 2 (cid:137) 0 ; 1 (cid:138) . The misclassi¢cation structure is , therefore , given by : p (cid:133) r 0 i (cid:136) 0 j r i (cid:136) 1 (cid:134) (cid:136) y p (cid:133) r 0 i (cid:136) 0 j r i (cid:136) 0 (cid:134) (cid:136) 1 where r 0 i (cid:136) 1 for deal i when the existence of prior relationships between the participating ¢rms is mentioned in the contract announcement or in prior public disclosures ; and r i (cid:136) 1 when the participating ¢rms in deal i had prior relationships , which may or may not have been disclosed ( i . e . r i is the ‘true’ relationship variable ) . ( Time subscripts are suppressed in the notation , and in what follows ) . The underlying model structure in turn is given by : r i (cid:136) 1 if X i b (cid:135) e i > 0 0 otherwise n where F e follows a cumulative normal distribution . The likelihood function can now be written as : l (cid:136) Y i (cid:18) X i p (cid:133) r 0 i (cid:136) 0 j r i (cid:134) p (cid:133) r i j X (cid:134) (cid:19) d 0 (cid:1) (cid:18) X i p (cid:133) r 0 i (cid:136) 1 j r i (cid:134) p (cid:133) r i j X (cid:134) (cid:19) 1 (cid:255) d 0 where d 0 (cid:136) 1 (cid:133) r 0 i (cid:136) 0 (cid:134) .

The results , presented in the table below , indicate that the extent of bias in the industry e¡ects increases with the degree of misclassi¢cation ; however , we underestimate the inter - industry di¡erences by assuming no misclassi¢cation . 43 For example , if y (cid:136) 0 : 5 , the estimated probability of observing licensings in SIC 35 between ¢rms with prior relationships is 0 . 75 , compared to 0 . 69 for deals in SIC 36 and 0 . 56 in SIC 28 respectively ; this compares with probabilities of 0 . 46 , 0 . 42 , and 0 . 34 in the three industries respectively , if y (cid:136) 0 . The estimated inter - industry di¡erences are lower with lower y ; if y (cid:136) 0 : 2 , for example , the respective probabilities are 0 . 49 , 0 . 45 , and 0 . 35 in the three industries , much closer to the estimates we obtain assuming no misclassi¢cation . 41 See Hausman and Scott Morton [ 1994 ] for a general treatment . 42 This is primarily due to the fact that it is not clear what identi¢es y in the given data . 43 The standard errors presented in the table are , of course , lower than what we would obtain if we estimated y . 132 bharat n . anand and tarun khanna (cid:223) Blackwell Publishers Ltd . 2000 . references Anand , B . and Galetovic , A . , 1998 , ‘Weak Property Rights and Hold - up in R & D’ , Harvard Business School Working Paper 99 - 007 .
