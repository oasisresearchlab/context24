Plants adapt to their changing environments by sensing and responding to physical , biological , and chemical stimuli . Due to their sessile lifestyles , plants experience a vast array of external stimuli and selectively perceive and respond to speci ﬁ c signals . By repurposing the logic circuitry and biological and molecular components used by plants in nature , genetically encoded plant - based biosensors ( GEPBs ) have been developed by directing signal recognition mechanisms into carefully assembled outcomes that are easily detected . GEPBs allow for in vivo monitoring of biological processes in plants to facilitate basic studies of plant growth and development . GEPBs are also useful for environmental monitoring , plant abiotic and biotic stress management , and accelerating design - build - test - learn cycles of plant bioengineering . With the advent of synthetic biology , biological and molecular components derived from alternate natural organisms ( e . g . , microbes ) and / or de novo parts have been used to build GEPBs . In this review , we summarize the framework for engineering di ﬀ erent types of GEPBs . We then highlight representative validated biological components for building plant - based biosensors , along with various applications of plant - based biosensors in basic and applied plant science research . Finally , we discuss challenges and strategies for the identi ﬁ cation and design of biological components for plant - based biosensors . 1 . Introduction Environmental perturbations and threats jeopardize many ecosystems on Earth . Real - time monitoring of biological processes , environmental threats , and ecosystem responses , with informative spatial and temporal resolution , remains a challenge , as traditional monitoring strategies are typically based on laboratory analysis of samples collected at speci ﬁ c time points and locations [ 1 – 3 ] . Biosensors o ﬀ er an alterna - tive to traditional destructive sampling schemes . Molecules , organisms , or devices in a biological context that sense spe - ci ﬁ c stimuli or molecules and convert such signals into a quantitative or qualitative indicator can function as biosen - sors [ 4 ] . With the power of ﬂ uorescent proteins and other visible reporters , genetically encoded visible biosensors pro - vide promising tools for large - scale environmental monitor - ing , high - resolution live - cell imaging , and so on . Plants are natural biosensors , responding to various envi - ronmental stimuli and generating real - time signals for inter - and intracellular communication [ 5 ] . Native , signal - responsive AAASBioDesign Research Volume 2022 , Article ID 9863496 , 19 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 34133 / 2022 / 9863496 promoters , signaling motifs ( e . g . nuclear export signals ( NESs ) ) , and short amino acids sequences ( i . e . , degrons ) , have been used as sensory components for engineering genetically encoded plant - based biosensors ( GEPBs ) [ 6 – 8 ] . While GEPBs allow sci - entists to monitor molecular events , cell activities , and meta - bolic pathways in real - time , they also o ﬀ er multiple desirable features for environmental monitoring . First , the integrated aboveground leaves and belowground root system allow plants to not only accept signals in the air , but to also sense the dynamic signals from a broad region of the soil [ 9 ] . Second , engineering biosensor in perennial plants species allows for cost - e ﬀ ective continuous monitoring of environmental condi - tions [ 9 ] . Third , with visible plant - based biosensors responsive to environmental factors , cumbersome sampling and laboratory analysis can be avoided [ 10 ] . An ideal plant - based biosensor should respond to speci ﬁ c stimuli and produce a quanti ﬁ able signal without disturbing the endogenous plant system . It has been di ﬃ cult to develop such plant biosensor systems based solely on endogenous components due to the complicated crosstalk among di ﬀ erent biological pathways . For instance , promoter - reporter systems derived from hormone signaling pathways ( e . g . , DR5 and TCS : : GFP ) can be a ﬀ ected by native pathways [ 11 ] . Further - more , many protein - degradation - based sensors ( e . g . , DII - VENUS and GFP - DELLA ) are irreversible , and thus once trig - gered miss transient or dynamic signal changes [ 11 , 12 ] . Hence , there is a need for new strategies to accelerate plant biosensor engineering . Plant biosystem design or plant synthetic biology is an emerging and quickly advancing ﬁ eld , which aims to design elite plants with desirable traits [ 4 , 13 ] . Synthetic biology poten - tially o ﬀ ers interchangeable components , standardized genetic circuit design , and Design - Build - Test - Learn ( DBTL ) cycles for rapidly developing plant - based biosensors [ 14 ] . The appli - cation of ﬂ uorescence proteins ( FPs ) in biosensor design is a good example demonstrating how synthetic biology utilizes universal components for building biosensors in various organ - isms . Standardization is important for plant biosystem design . Currently , there are no standard pipelines for choosing compo - nents to design and build genetic circuits as plant - based biosen - sors . In this review , we categorize plant - based biosensors based on the mode of action and list representative validated biolog - ical and molecular components for engineering each type of biosensor with the goal of proposing a standard roadmap for building genetically encoded plant - based biosensors . In addi - tion , we discuss how to identify and design new biological com - ponents for bioengineering to expand the applications of plant - based biosensors . 2 . Framework for Engineering Genetically Encoded Plant - Based Biosensors Standardized components and frameworks are the ﬁ rst step towards a universal roadmap for building GEPBs . In general , GEPBs consist of a sensory element coupled to visible reporter proteins [ 11 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Based on whether biosensors rely on Sensory module O p t i c a l p r o p e r t i e s c h a n g e T r a n s c r i p t i o n a l c h a n g e T r a n s l a t i o n a l c h a n g e L o c a l i z a t i o n c h a n g e Reportermodule Optical M o r p h o l o g i c a l C o n f o r m a t i o n a l c h a n g e Figure 1 : Conceptual framework of genetically encoded plant - based biosensors ( GEPBs ) design . GEPBs contain a Sensory Module and a Reporter Module . Five di ﬀ erent mechanisms of Sensory Modules are presented in the gray gear , and two types of Reporters Module are presented in the yellow gear . The Sensory Module detects the environmental , chemical , or internal stimuli , and the Reporter Module provides the detectable signal . 2 BioDesign Research the endogenous cellular processes , they can be categorized into two types : direct and indirect biosensors . Direct biosensors typically rely on ﬂ uorescence proteins ( FPs ) whose properties are altered by the sensing activities or interaction with ana - lytes , while indirect biosensors consist of cellular components involved in transcription , posttranslational modi ﬁ cation , or translocation . Each biosensor type has advantages and limitations . Direct biosensors are a basic bioimaging tool with straightforward design principles , high sensitivity , and a wide range of resolu - tion . Such direct biosensors produce reversible readouts that can re ﬂ ect the real - time change of cellular processes . Alterna - tively , indirect biosensors rely on cellular process , e . g . , transcrip - tion or translation , adding regulatable layers of output that can be ﬁ ne - tuned . The genetic circuit design for indirect biosensors can also be used to produce metabolites or proteins as reporters . Hence , indirect biosensors o ﬀ er more advanced tools with ﬂ ex - ible designs that expand the biosensor toolbox to bene ﬁ t plant biosystem design . However , because the output of indirect bio - sensors is usually irreversible , it is di ﬃ cult to use indirect bio - sensors to monitor real - time dynamic cellular processes . In this section , strategies for designing di ﬀ erent types of biosensors will be discussed and a decision map for applying di ﬀ erent types of plant - based biosensors is illustrated in Figure 2 . 2 . 1 . Direct Plant Biosensors . Direct biosensors require no addi - tional sensory module or only one sensory module directly interacting with the analytes . There are two types of direct bio - sensors , intrinsic and extrinsic direct biosensors . The intrinsic direct biosensors harbor reporters sensitive to the cellular environment , whereas the extrinsic direct biosensors contain a sensory module whose structural change , causing a change in distance / orientation of two reporters , leading to signal changes [ 15 ] . Because the structural change is always revers - ible , direct biosensors allow detection of dynamic pro - cesses [ 16 ] . 2 . 1 . 1 . Intrinsic Direct Plant Biosensors . FPs can be readily detected by ﬂ uorescence microscopy without adding ﬂ uores - cent dyes , making them useful visible reporters for noninva - sive imaging ( Figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) ) . For example , a phenol group on the chromophore allows pH to a ﬀ ect the optical properties of most green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) variants [ 17 ] . The structural basis of wild - type GFP ( wtGFP ) and the chromophore of GFP , including three consecutive amino acids S65 , Y66 , and G67 and residues responsible for ﬂ ores - cence , have been identi ﬁ ed [ 17 ] . Here , the excitation property of FPs is related to the ionization state of the chromophore , whose equilibrium is controlled by a hydrogen bond network that permits proton transfer to the neighboring amino acids when the chromophore is excited [ 18 , 19 ] . This understanding has ushered in the opportunity for expanded FP engineering . Most intrinsic direct biosensors were developed through targeted mutagenesis or random mutagenesis of the chromo - phore of FPs [ 20 ] . The abundance of available FPs facilitates potential applications for a wide variety of biosensors for pH , ion concentration , and redox conditions within plant cells [ 18 , 21 – 24 ] . Some FPs emit di ﬀ erent ﬂ uorescence intensity in various cellular environments , while other modi ﬁ ed FPs have bimodal excitation / emission spectra , where the excitation / emission ratio re ﬂ ects the change of cellular environmental conditions [ 25 , 26 ] . This type of biosensor solely relies on the Does the analyte / signal directly impact the properties of reporters ?

The validated intensity - based and ratio - metric intrinsic direct biosensors will be discussed in Section 3 . 2 . 1 . 2 . Extrinsic Direct Plant Biosensors . Di ﬀ erent FPs can also be fused to a sensory module to enable the use of a ﬂ uores - cence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) signal as a readout and is known as a FRET - based biosensor ( Figure 3 ( c ) ) . In this circumstance , any con ﬁ rmational change in the sensory mod - ule will alter the distance / orientation of the two FPs and thereby modify the FRET e ﬃ ciency [ 27 ] . Based on a similar principle , using di ﬀ erent luciferase variants , bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ( BRET ) - based biosensors have been developed for imaging protein interactions in plant and mam - malian cells and tissues [ 28 , 29 ] . Because readout of FRET - based biosensors is excitation / emission ratio , this type of bio - sensor is ratiometric ( i . e . , the output is directly proportional to the input ) . The tolerance of GFPs for circular permutations and inser - tion of entire proteins o ﬀ ers another strategy for building extrinsic direct plant biosensors [ 30 ] . The conformational changes in the insert can in ﬂ uence the spectral properties of these circular permutated FPs . Hence , single circularly permu - tated FPs ( cpFPs ) can fuse with the sensory module to build extrinsic direct biosensors ( Figure 3 ( d ) ) . The readout of this type of extrinsic direct biosensors can be either ratiometric or intensiometric ( i . e . , intensity change depending on the design ) . Based on a speci ﬁ c design principle , the direct binding partner / receptor for the analyte is necessary for designing extrinsic direct biosensors . Moreover , the structural change induced by the binding / sensing activity is another important factor to be considered for designing extrinsic direct biosen - sors . Modi ﬁ cation of the sensory module can be applied for adjusting the analyte a ﬃ nity [ 11 ] . Extrinsic direct plant bio - sensors that have been widely used for sensing various ana - lytes will be presented in detail in Section 3 . 2 . 2 . Indirect Plant Biosensors . Direct binding partner / recep - tors are not always feasible in biosensor design . Under these circumstances , the downstream cellular processes induced by the binding / sensing activity can be applied as indicators for the signals , known as an indirect biosensor . Indirect bio - sensors need additional cellular processes to render a signal for a particular analyte or stimulus , and are typically grouped as transcription - based biosensors , posttranslational - based biosensors , and translocation - based biosensors .

Figures are redesigned from the results in Populus [ 68 ] . 4 BioDesign Research found within the system under study . Because biological pro - cesses are complicated , indirect biosensors typically require a greater number of biological and molecular parts and are more complicated in comparison to direct biosensors . 2 . 2 . 1 . Transcriptional Regulation - Based Plant Biosensors . If the binding / sensing activity causes a transcriptional change in the plant system , transcriptional regulation - based biosensors can be considered . Transcription factors ( TFs ) and promoters are two main components of plant transcriptional machinery that serve as sensory modules for transcriptional regulation - based biosensor design . There are two types of transcription - based biosensors depending on the sensory module ( Figure 4 ) . The ﬁ rst , known as a promoter - reporter system , utilizes promoters as the sensory module that regulates the transcription level of reporters ( Figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) ) . A native plant gene promoter is the DNA sequence upstream of the transcription start sites ( TSS ) of a gene . A good example of transcription - based biosen - sors is β - glucuronidase or FPs driven by a synthetic or native hormone - responsive promoter for measuring phytohormone accumulation [ 31 , 32 ] . However , because of the complex signal - ing networks within a plant system , applying endogenous plant promoters for sensory modules often results in low and com - plex patterns of readouts [ 33 ] . To enhance the speci ﬁ city and sensitivity of the promoters , multiple core response elements can be used to create a synthetic promoter . For example , the synthetic DR5 promoter , consisting of 7 - 9 TGTCTC Aux response element repeats , have been used to drive the expres - sion of di ﬀ erent reporters such as β - glucuronidase , ﬂ uorescent proteins , or luciferase to create a biosensor for auxin [ 31 ] . The second type of transcription - based biosensor uses syn - thetic TFs as the sensory module ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) . Here a TF is fused to a degron or conditionally stable ligand binding domain to construct a responsive synthetic activator / repressor regulated by posttranslational modi ﬁ cations [ 34 , 35 ] . Although the responsive degrons or conditionally stable ligand binding domains can be directly fused with reporters to design post - translational regulation - based plant biosensors , the synthetic TFs can amplify the biosensor response and serve as a ligand - dependent controller for gene expression [ 35 ] . Endogenous signaling transduction systems ( i . e . , native plant promoters and TFs ) can interfere with transcription - based biosensors . To overcome this concern , several orthog - onal regulatory systems from Saccharomyces spp . , bacteria , and other organisms have been developed for modulating transcription in plants [ 36 , 37 ] . Likewise , a functional signal transduction system from bacteria has been engineered for plant transcriptional regulation - based biosensor design [ 38 ] ( Figure 4 ( d ) ) . The detail design strategies of those orthogonal regulators will be discussed in Section 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 . Posttranslational Modi ﬁ cation - Based Plant Biosensors . A change in protein level , i . e . , an accumulated reporter , has been utilized for biosensor design ( Figure 5 ) .

( d ) Illustration of constructs design and readout of TNT plant - based biosensor . Figures were adopted from phenotypic data of Arabidopsis [ 38 ] . 5 BioDesign Research ligand - binding domains ( LBDs ) linked to reporters have been used as a general strategy to build small molecule biosensors [ 35 ] . Such engineered LBDs are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system until it binds to the signal molecules and thereby creates sensing / binding activity ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) . Cur - rently , some conditionally stable LBDs have been engineered for sensing small molecules based on computational design [ 35 , 39 ] . For example , an engineered LBD biosensor for digox - igenin has been applied in plants [ 35 ] ( Figure 5 ( b ) ) . A robust computational design is the ﬁ rst step for LBD engineering . Next , high - throughput experimental characterization is required for evaluating the ligand - dependent responses . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) is a commonly used strategy . To obtain the ideal LBD - based biosensor , one round of optimization is usually needed . Error - prone PCR and site - saturation mutagenesis are two methods for creating a variable library of LBDs for characterization . Another strategy is to apply a signal responsive degron as the sensory module coupled with a reporter gene ( Figure 5 ( c ) ) . The binding of the target analyte promotes degradation of the degron that thus yields a signal . A well - known degron - based biosensor DII - VENUS reporter system was developed by fus - ing the VENUS yellow ﬂ uorescent protein in frame to the degron motif of AtIAA28 [ 6 ] ( Figure 5 ( d ) ) . Jas9 - VENUS has also been developed for mapping local changes in JA levels in Arabidopsis roots [ 40 ] . Fluorescence levels for these two biosensors are inversely correlated to endogenous phytohor - mone levels . 2 . 2 . 3 . Translocation - Based Plant Biosensors . While transcrip - tional regulation - based and posttranslational modi ﬁ cation - based biosensors monitor the input signal by changes in the abundance of reporters , and translocation - based biosensors uti - lize spatial location of reporters to measure signal levels . The localization of proteins can be tracked by fusing a FP to a pro - tein of interest ( Figure 6 ) . The change in localization of the sen - sory module with a reporter can be used as a readout to monitor the input signal . This kind of biosensor is an ideal tool for study - ing protein localization , hormone signaling pathways , and pro - tein phosphorylation levels [ 11 , 27 , 41 ] . For instance , because the brassinosteroid ( BR ) signaling promotes BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 ( BZR1 ) nuclear localization , BZR1 fused with YFP can serve as a biosensor for BR signaling in Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls [ 42 ] ( Figures 6 ( a ) and 6 ( b ) ) . Another example of translocation - based biosensors are kinase translocation reporters ( KTRs ) ( Figures 6 ( c ) and 6 ( d ) ) . KTRs are comprised of an FP fused to a substrate rec - ognition motif for a target kinase , where phosphorylation sites are attached to a negatively phospho - regulated nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) and a positively phospho - regulated nuclear export signal ( NES ) [ 43 ] . A nonphosphorylated KTR locates within the nucleus via its NLS . Once there , phosphorylation of the NES allows KTR to exit the nucleus , which leads to the conversion of a phosphorylation event into a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling event [ 41 , 44 ] . Similarly , the intein - mediated conditional protein splicing ( CPS ) reaction has become an important strategy for protein Degron Proteosomaldegradation Degron Reporter protein Analytes ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) LBD Reporter LBD Degraded Stabilized G - DIG 1 - VP16 - Mat 𝛼 2 35Spro Ter Luciferase UASpro Ter Construct design Readout : Luciferase activity 100 𝜇 M digoxin Underdark Underdark Construct design DII - VENUS 35Spro Ter NLS High ( Low auxin level ) Low ( High auxin level ) F l u o r e s c e n c e Auxin distribution map Figure 5 : Design of posttranslational modi ﬁ cation - based plant biosensors .

Pro indicates promoter , and ter represents terminator . 6 BioDesign Research engineering [ 45 , 46 ] . The intein - mediated split NLS and NES has also been applied for building translocation - based biosen - sors [ 47 , 48 ] . Essentially , the split signal peptide ( NLS or NES ) is fused to a FP serves as a reporter . Upon the sensing activity , the signal peptide will be reconstituted via intein - mediated protein splicing , resulting in the translocation of sig - nals . Thus far , this strategy has not been applied for building translocation - based biosensors in plants . Translocation - based biosensors can also be used for detecting gene expression in real time . PP7 and MS2 RNA labeling technologies have been applied to building plant bio - sensors for gene expression [ 49 ] . Nascent RNA labeling with an RNA aptamer such as the MS2 or PP7 recruits FPs fused with an MS2 coat protein or PP7 bacteriophage coat protein to transcriptional loci [ 49 ] . The ﬂ uorescence intensity of these signals re ﬂ ects the instantaneous rate of transcription [ 49 ] . 3 . Validated Biological Components for Different Types of Plant - Based Biosensors Based on the framework discussed in Section 2 , here biological components including sensory modules ( promoter sequences , protein - coding sequences , and noncoding RNAs ) and reporters ( optical and morphological ) are reviewed in the con - text of validated biological components for di ﬀ erent types of plant biosensors . In this section , the application of frameworks mentioned above for designing various plant biosensors will be discussed in the context of further guidance for plant bio - sensor design . 3 . 1 . Validated Biological Components for Direct Plant Biosensors . As mentioned in Section 2 . 1 , FPs have been modi - ﬁ ed as intrinsic direct biosensors for sensing di ﬀ erent analytes and changes of cellular environment . Representative biological components and design illustrations of intrinsic direct plant - based biosensors are listed in Table 1 . With an additional sen - sory module , many extrinsic direct biosensors have been designed to sense direct signal binding activities . Validated sen - sory modules and design strategies for extrinsic direct plant - based biosensors are listed in Table 2 . 3 . 1 . 1 . Validated Components for Intrinsic Direct Plant Biosensors . Taking advantage of pH - dependent excitation and emission properties of FPs , a single FP can be used as an intrinsic direct plant biosensor for measuring pH within plant cells . An example is the ratiometric phGFP that has been expressed in Arabidopsis for monitoring intracellular pH changes . This direct biosensor exhibited a dynamic range of 410 nm / 470 nm excitation ratio for pH from 5 . 5 to 7 . 5 [ 50 ] . Tandem fusion of di ﬀ erent FPs has also been applied for intrinsic direct plant biosensor design . The pH sensor named ‘ pHusion ’ consists of a monomeric red ﬂ uorescent protein ( mRFP1 ) and an enhanced GFP [ 51 ] . Currently , three new ratiometric biosensors composed of two FPs in tandem have been generated for measuring a pH range of 3 - 8 within the plant cell apoplast [ 52 ] . Beyond the intrinsic pH sensitivity , ions near chromo - phores impact the spectral properties of FPs , which allows FPs to be engineered to measure the concentrations of various chemical ions within plant cells .

A ratiometric optical indicator for chloride concen - tration has been constructed by fusing the chloride - sensitive YFP and chloride insensitive cyan ﬂ uorescent protein [ 55 ] . This biosensor can be applied for the monitoring salt stress [ 56 ] . Engineering the metal binding sites of the Av - GFP resulted in a highly speci ﬁ c direct biosensor , eGFP20C , for monitoring mercury uptake [ 57 ] . Additional intrinsic direct biosensors can be developed by engineering the potential metal binding sites of FPs . Another important application of intrinsic plant biosensors is real - time monitoring of plant cell redox conditions and energy physiology . In plants , redox reactions are involved in photosynthesis , respiration , and many other plant energy metabolism pathways [ 18 ] . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are key signals in plant development and stress responses [ 18 ] . Genetically encoded intrinsic direct plant biosensors allow monitoring the dynamics of redox conditions and energy metabolites at high spatial resolution , which provides detailed insights into plant physiology [ 18 , 58 ] . Structural changes in the FP ß - barrel , redox - sensitive YFP ( rxYFP ) , and redox - sensitive GFP ( roGFP ) have been engineered and used as intrinsic plant biosensors [ 59 ] . Among these , roGFP2 is the most commonly used because of its photostability , pH - insensi - tivity , and good signal - to - noise ratio [ 60 , 61 ] . FPs can also be modi ﬁ ed to detect the CRISPR machin - ery in plants . Intentionally inactivated GFPs that cannot emit ﬂ uorescence signals can be constructed in a system with an active CRISPR / Cas9 with a guide RNA targeting and repairing the mutated residue in GFP , restores the coding sequence and thus ﬂ uorescence . CRISPR / Cas - based genome engineering tools have been widely applied in various plant studies . However , o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects of CRISPR / Cas systems or CRISPR - based contaminating gene raise potential biose - curity risks [ 62 ] . Hence , a biosensor system to detect CRISPR / Cas systems at an early stage is needed . In this regard , a plant - based biosensor has been developed using mutated GFP genes for detecting CRISPR / Cas - based genome engineering tools , such as based editors and prime edi - tors [ 62 ] . Currently , studies focused on monitoring genome engineering tools are still at an early stage , and the developed biosensors can only monitor speci ﬁ c genome engineering tools . More e ﬀ ort is needed for building universal biosensors monitor - ing various CRISPR / Cas - based genome engineering invasions . 3 . 1 . 2 . Validated Components for Extrinsic Direct Plant Biosensors . Extrinsic direct plant biosensors require an addi - tional sensory module to directly interact with analytes . The sensory module can be fused with either a single cpGFP to make a biosensor or two di ﬀ erent FPs to build a FRET - based biosensor . One of the most developed and widely applied extrinsic direct plant biosensor is the genetically encoded calcium indicator ( GECI ) . The sensing module for Ca 2 + is cal - modulin ( CaM ) , which recognizes a short polypeptide M13 in target protein [ 63 ] . Here , a single GFP GECIs is fused with the calmodulin - M13 to create a single circularly permutated FPs ( cpFPs ) , where the presence of Ca 2 + , calmodulin binds to the M13 , inducing conformational changes of FP and inducing its ﬂ uorescent properties [ 30 , 64 ] . In addition , the GCaMP [ 65 ] and pericam [ 66 ] are two representative GECIs developed based on this strategy . With mutation of several amino acids adjacent to the chromophore , ratiometric - pericam and inten - sity based - pericam have been developed for monitoring the dynamic change of Ca 2 + concentration . The cpGFP - based cal - cium indicator G - GECO has been applied for monitoring the calcium spiking triggered by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus in plants [ 67 , 68 ] . The other widely adopted method for designing GECIs is the FRET - based biosensor . The principle is to ﬂ ank the Ca 2 + sensory module , CaM - M13 with two dif - ferent FPs . Binding of the Ca 2 + causes calmodulin to bind to M13 , thus FRET between the ﬂ anking FPs [ 69 ] . For example , in yellow Cameleon - 2 , the CaM - M13 was fused with N - terminal CFP as the FRET donor and C - terminal YFP as the FRET acceptor [ 69 ] . FIP - CA indicators are another available design in which only the M13 is linked to two FPs with the engineered CaM fused to the C - terminus of this protein [ 70 ] . A similar design strategy has been applied in building plant biosensors for other ions . For instance , high - a ﬃ nity FRET - based Zn 2 + biosensors have been developed using two Zinc - binding domain as sensory modules [ 71 ] . Two Zn 2 + binding domains , Atox1 and the fourth domain of ATP7B ( WD4 ) , were linked via a ﬂ exible linker and ﬂ anked by two FPs . This FRET - based biosensor has been applied for measur - ing the Zn 2 + concentrations in Arabidopsis root cells [ 72 ] . In addition , the cyanobacterial inorganic phosphate , Pi binding protein , has been applied as sensory module ﬂ anked by eCFP as FRET donor and di ﬀ erent FPs as FRET acceptors for build - ing FRET - based biosensors detecting Pi in plants [ 73 ] . Phytohormone receptors can serve as sensory modules for building extrinsic direct phytohormone biosensors . For instance , potential ABA sensory domains ( PAS ) were selected from members of ABA coreceptor complexes for ABA FRET - based biosensors design [ 74 ] . Here , there were two types of designs : a single domain design , in which either a member of PYR / PYL / RCAR family of ABA receptors or a member of the PP2CA subfamily of ABA coreceptor phos - phatases alone is inserted between two FPs , and a double domain design , in which the sensory module consists of a PYL / PYR / PCAR fused with a PP2CA via a linker [ 74 ] . After screening di ﬀ erent ABA biosensor designs , ABACUS1 , a FRET - based biosensor built with ABA receptor PYL and coreceptor PP2CAs , is characterized by an a ﬃ nity of ~ 80 μ M , was selected for ABA [ 74 ] . Auxin is another impor - tant phytohormone regulating plant development . Auxin biosensors provide e ﬀ ective tools for revealing the dynamics of auxin signaling during many developmental contexts . A novel FRET - based biosensor for auxin has been built using an engineered bacterial tryptophan repressor ( TrpR ) [ 12 ] . To build this biosensor , the selected TrpR variants with high a ﬃ nity to IAA were ﬂ anked by Aquamarine as the FRET donor and mNeonGreen as the FRET acceptor [ 12 ] . Any protein conformational change caused by the sur - rounding environment without direct binding activity can also be monitored by extrinsic direct plant biosensors . Intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of a protein are domains that can be sensitive to the physical – chemical properties of its surround - ing environment . Utilizing the Arabidopsis intrinsically 9 BioDesign Research disordered AtLEA4 - 5 protein , whose con ﬁ rmational change is induced by water de ﬁ cit , a FRET biosensor named SED1 was developed for monitoring water - associated stress in living bac - teria , yeast , plant , and human cells [ 75 ] . 3 . 2 . Validated Components for Indirect Plant Biosensors . In contrast with direct biosensors , the sensory modules of indirect plant biosensors are involved in various biological processes . Because the readout of indirect plant biosensors is the quantity of reporter present , indirect biosensors are usually intensio - metric . A ratiometric readout , though less common , can be obtained with a nonresponsive reporter for normalization . Without relying on the structural change of the FPs , morpho - logical reporters can also be applied for indirect plant biosen - sors design . In this section , validated representative biological parts of indirect plant - based biosensors will be discussed and are listed in Tables 3 – 5 . 3 . 2 . 1 . Validated Components for Transcriptional Regulation - Based Plant Biosensors . The promoter - reporter systems are the simplest design for transcriptional regulation - based bio - sensors . In plants , promoters control genes expression pat - terns , and as noted above , promoter - reporter systems have been used for sensing phytohormones . For example , the expression of ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase driven by the abscisic acid ( ABA ) - inducible promoter has been developed to sense ABA levels in plants [ 76 , 77 ] . A similar biosensor for investi - gating the dynamics of cytokinin using the synthetic pro - moter , TCS , has also been created [ 78 ] . Additionally , salicylic acid ( SA ) biosensors built with an SA responsive promoter , ﬂ agellin sensing 2 promoter , and a synthetic pro - moter have been utilized for monitoring biotic stress in plants [ 79 ] . Currently , novel cis sequences that respond to speci ﬁ c stimuli can be rapidly discovered and identi ﬁ ed via bioinfor - matic tools and high - throughput gene expression pro ﬁ les [ 80 , 81 ] . To increase the accuracy of motif prediction , multi - ple bioinformatic tools should be applied for motif evalua - tion [ 81 ] . Once cis sequences have been identi ﬁ ed synthetic responsive promoters can be designed by fusing multiple copies of a motif with a minimal 35S promoter . Both abiotic and biotic responsive synthetic promoters have been devel - oped following this approach [ 33 , 80 , 81 ] . For instance , ﬁ ve synthetic promoters have been developed for building bio - sensors sensing drought or salt stress [ 33 ] . The de novo soy - bean cyst nematode - inducible synthetic promoters have been designed as biosensors monitoring soybean cyst nema - tode infection [ 81 ] . Using this method , pathogen elicitor - responsive synthetic promoters have been made for studying plant - pathogen interactions [ 80 ] . The output of promoter - reporter systems may be a ﬀ ected by cross talk from other pathways ; the synthetic signal trans - duction system promises independent regulatory systems for building transcriptional regulation - based plant biosensors . For example , a bacterial periplasmic binding protein ( PBP ) was redesigned as a trinitrotoluene ( TNT ) receptor [ 38 ] . When TNT binds to this receptor , the con ﬁ rmational change of the PBP - TNT complex promotes its interaction with a bac - terial chemotactic receptor ( e . g . , Trg ) . Here , the Trg was fused with a histidine kinase ( HK ) to produce a chimeric kinase that transfers the TNT binding activity to Phosphorus - dependent gene expression [ 38 ] . A synthetic TF PhoB - VP64 and syn - thetic promoter PlantPho , together with the Trg - HK , makes a complete synthetic signal transduction system . The TNT receptor , together with synthetic signal transduction compo - nents and a synthetic reporter degreening gene circuit , were introduced to Arabidopsis to build a plant - based biosensor for monitoring TNT [ 38 ] . Finally , combining cis elements from yeast with plant min - imal promoters has been used to create a set of synthetic pro - moters with various expression strengths . Together with di ﬀ erent TFs , such as Gal4 , MADS ( MCM1 ) , and GATA ( Gat1 ) , an orthogonal regulatory tool box for transcription - based biosensors has been created for plants [ 36 ] . Using a phos - phate responsive promoter , AtPht1 . 1 to drive the synthetic acti - vator , an external phosphate biosensor was made in Arabidopsis [ 36 ] . In addition , dCas9 - based synthetic TFs can be used to pro - vide additional design options for transcription - based biosen - sors . For example , a synthetic hormone - responsive biosensor has been developed fusing the dCas9 - based repressor with phy - tohormone inducible degrons [ 34 ] . 3 . 2 . 2 . Validated Components for Posttranslational Modi ﬁ cation - Based Plant Biosensors . Posttranslational modi ﬁ cation - based plant biosensors , such as degron - based biosensors , have been successfully design and tested based on ubiquitin - mediated protein degradation [ 82 , 83 ] . Because proteins under hormone - dependent degradation are often regulators of phytohormone signaling pathways , degron - based biosensors are ideal tools to monitor the change of phytohormones in di ﬀ erent plant tissues during various development stages . For example , gibberellin ( GA ) indica - tors have been developed by fusing GFP with DELLA proteins to monitor GA levels in hypocotyls during photo - morphogenesis [ 11 , 84 ] . By fusing the FP VENUS with auxin - inducible degron motif DII , a novel auxin biosensor was designed to map auxin distribution with single cell res - olution [ 85 ] . Similarly , with the jasmonic acid ( JA ) - respon - sive degron motif of the JAZ repressors coupled with VENUS , the Jas9 - VENUS biosensor was made for analyzing responses to JA in plants with cellular resolution [ 40 ] . The readouts of all these three biosensors are intensiometric , whereas the ratiometric version of these biosensors has been made by including another stable reporter . For example , the R2D2 , a ratiometric auxin biosensor , has been made by including a mDII - tdTomato reporter for normalization [ 31 ] . Another ratiometric degron - based biosensor , Strigo - Quant , was engineered by linking AtSMXL6 with a ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase to quantify strigolactone ( SL ) activity and speci ﬁ c - ity [ 11 , 86 ] . Computational design of ligand binding proteins prom - ises novel components for biosensors sensing small mole - cules . As mentioned in Section 2 , engineered conditionally stable LBDs have also been applied as sensory elements for plant - based biosensors . The computationally designed bind - ing domains , such as DIG0 binding the plant steroid glyco - side digoxin , progesterone binder ( PRO0 ) , and the potent analgesic fentanyl binder , have been applied in building 10 BioDesign Research plant - based biosensors [ 35 , 39 , 87 ] . Fusing these ligand bind - ing domains with degrons and adding a transcriptional acti - vation domain creates responsive synthetic transcriptional factors that can amplify the reporter signal of the biosen - sors [ 35 ] . 3 . 2 . 3 . Validated Components for Translocation - Based Plant Biosensors . Translocation - based biosensors re ﬂ ect the change of localization of reporters induced by the signals . This type of biosensor provides high resolution at the single cell level . Translocation - based biosensors have been used as tools for monitoring protein localization , phosphorylation activity , and gene expression . As mentioned in Section 2 . 2 . 3 , the bio - sensor BZR1 - CFP has been used in investigating the spatio - temporal brassinosteroid signaling in Arabidopsis [ 42 ] . Because the localization of transcription factors NLP7 is Table 3 : Selected examples of validated biological parts for transcriptional regulation - based plant biosensors .

Similarly , phosphoinositide signaling is mediated by di ﬀ erent lipid - binding domains via the direct recruitment of e ﬀ ector proteins to the plasma membrane [ 88 , 89 ] . A multicolor / multia ﬃ nity marker set has been built by fusing lipid - binding domains with FPs to visualize phos - phoinositide dynamics in Arabidopsis [ 90 ] . Protein phosphorylation plays key roles in signaling net - works of cell di ﬀ erentiation , plant development , and stress responses [ 44 ] . Kinase translocation reporters ( KTRs ) have been used to enable spatiotemporal visualization of protein kinase activity in plant cells [ 91 ] . Although many KTRs have been developed for mammalian cells , Caenorhabditis elegans , and zebra ﬁ sh [ 92 – 95 ] , only two translocation reporters have been designed in plant systems [ 96 ] . These two translocation reporters were made by fusing two mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPKs ) docking domains , MKP1 and AP2C1 , with the kinase localization reporter ( KLR ) . Both exhibit changes in subcellular localization in response to chitin [ 96 ] . It is always a challenge to build a biosensor for detecting the dynamic expression of target genes because most of the output data re ﬂ ect the change at the protein level using protein - dependent reporters . Currently , PP7 and MS2 RNA labelling technologies have been used for monitoring regions of active transcription in plants [ 49 ] . Simpler RNA labeling technologies have been developed with the discov - ery of ﬂ uorescent RNA aptamers . Bai et al . [ 97 ] have used a ﬂ uorescent RNA aptamer 3WJ - 4 × Bro , which is a ﬂ uores - cent tag used for visualizing the transcriptome in real time , to identify transcriptional activity . 4 . Next - Generation Identification and Design of Biological Components for Engineering Plant - Based Biosensors Advanced genome engineering technologies ( e . g . , CRISPR / Cas tools ) o ﬀ er exciting prospects with respect to next - generation plant - based biosensors ; however , there are several unique chal - lenges that must be addressed . A challenge of plant - based bio - sensor design is validation due to tedious tissue - or cell - level assays . Advancements in protein - engineering technologies are largely hampered by the lack of high - throughput screening sys - tems in plants . To solve this problem , single cell transient assay systems using FACS could be applied for high - throughput screening in plants . Apart from these technical challenges , plant biosystems have inherently complex circuitry logic , span - ning and intersecting multiple layers of biochemical , molecular , and cellular processes . Engineering across these multiple layers remains a grand challenge [ 98 ] . Additional biological compo - nents , involved in alternate levels of gene regulation , are still needed for addressing this challenge . In this section , principles and strategies of designing biological parts for engineering plant - based biosensors will be discussed . 4 . 1 . Principles for the Design of Sensory Elements for Plant Biosensors . To design extrinsic direct biosensors and indirect biosensors , domains , motifs , promoters , etc . can be used as sensory modules for targeted or speci ﬁ c analytes . In the ﬁ rst approach , conformational changes of the sensory module is caused by binding with the signal molecules . In the second approach , the sensory module is used to regulate the tran - scription level of reporters by binding with the analyte .

In the third approach , the sensory module is used to change the translational level of reporters and thus give a readout when sensing the signal molecules . In the fourth approach , binding with the analyte is used to change localization of the biosensor and thus the movement of the biosensor is used as a readout . In addition to the four features , analyte binding speci ﬁ c - ity and a ﬃ nity are two additional key factors that should be considered when designing the sensory module in biosen - sors . These two factors will in ﬂ uence the sensitivity of bio - sensors . Computational design of ligand - binding domains has also been applied to engineer LBDs with higher speci ﬁ c - ity and a ﬃ nity [ 35 , 39 , 87 ] . 4 . 2 . Principles for Choosing Reporters for Plant Biosensors . There are two types of reporter modules , optical reporters ( FPs and Luc ) and morphological reporters ( e . g . , color markers and herbicide / antibiotic resistant marker ) . Optical reporters can be applied for monitoring signal changes at the cellular level , whereas the morphological reporters are usually used to re ﬂ ect signal changes at the whole - plant level . The choice of reporters for direct biosensors is limited to optical reporters . For indirect biosensors , other than optical reporters , morphological reporters can be applied . Emerging examples for application of morphological reporters are the synthetic RUBY markers that have been being widely utilized for trans - genic plant selection [ 99 ] . Identifying the ideal reporter is important for plant biosen - sor design . Key to this identi ﬁ cation is an easily detectable sig - nal . Fluorescent proteins are being implemented for biosensor design because their ﬂ uorescence signals can be reliably detected and imaged . A new reporter RUBY that converts tyro - sine to vividly red betalain can be detected without the need of special equipment or chemical treatment [ 99 ] . Another poten - tial reporter for biosensor is eYGFPuv , which has been success - fully used as a reporter for plant transformation [ 100 , 101 ] . Both RUBY and eYGFPuv could be used as suitable reporters for building transcriptional - or translational - based biosensors . Additionally , reporters fused to a sensory module need them - self to be insensitive to the analyte . Likewise , the reporters should be expressed e ﬃ ciently resulting in no toxicity to the chosen system [ 100 ] . Another important factor for choosing the reporter is the maturation time and half - life . This factor is especially important for building degron - based biosensors . For example , the VENUS fast maturing yellow ﬂ uorescent pro - tein ( YFP ) has been fused with DII domain to overcome the technical limitation of GFP maturation time , where GFP mat - uration time is often longer than Aux / IAA half - lives [ 6 ] . Alter - natively , many biosensors need to monitor signals in real time . The accumulation of proteins may not allow the biosensor to re ﬂ ect the real - time change of the signal . In this case , a reporter with a short half - life should be considered . Luciferase reaction can emit bioluminescence within a short time frame , and there - fore a luciferase reporter is also a good choice for real - time signal monitoring . 4 . 3 . Identi ﬁ cation of Natural Biological Components for Biosensor Engineering in Plants . Plant system biology has pro - vided a large amount of biological parts for biosensor design from its detailed characterization of molecular components in plant systems [ 102 ] . Many sensory modules are being dis - covered through basic plant biology studies . The knowledge of protein - protein interactions and upstream regulators of sig - naling pathways is essential for choosing the right parts for designing biosensors . Currently , the rapid accumulation of omics data is accelerating progress towards gene , promoter , and motif discovery [ 103 ] . Transgenic overexpression lines and knock - out mutants are used to validate predicted parts . However , traditional plant tissue culture is time consuming and labor intensive , creating a bottleneck for parts mining . Recently , progress has been made in plant transformation using developmental regulators . For example , overexpression of developmental regulators , such as Baby Boom , Wuschel , GROWTH - REGULATING FACTOR 4 ( GRF4 ) , and its cofactor GRF - INTERACTING FACTOR 1 ( GIF1 ) , have dramatically increased the e ﬃ ciency and speed of regeneration in di ﬀ erent plant species [ 104 , 105 ] . In addi - tion , developmental regulators have been used together with gene editing reagents to generate gene - edited plants through de novo meristem induction , thereby , bypassing the tissue cul - ture process [ 106 ] . 4 . 4 . Modi ﬁ cation of Natural Biological Components for Biosensor Engineering in Plants . Naturally occurring biological components are involved in complex networks and usually involve crosstalk with di ﬀ erent signaling pathways . The lack of understanding of the mechanisms involved in signaling pathway crosstalk is limiting for biosensor development . An alternate route to the modi ﬁ cation of natural biological compo - nents may be achieved via protein engineering . Directed evo - lution has been a successful method for protein engineering . This approach has been used to generate a library of vari - ants followed by screening to identify desirable designs [ 107 ] . Computational modeling o ﬀ ers another approach for protein engineering . For instance , using computational modeling , metal binding sites have been engineered into green ﬂ uorescence protein for sensing Cu 2 + , Ni 2 + , or Co 2 + [ 108 ] . The features of naturally occurring binding sites should be considered when developing a computational method for engineering ligand - binding proteins [ 39 ] . Such that , the binding of the ligands should be energetically favor - able . Secondly , the overall shape of the binding site should be complementary to the ligand . Thirdly , the structure of the unbound protein should be stable . Based on these principles , a robust computational method for the design of high a ﬃ nity and speci ﬁ city ligand - binding - proteins has been developed [ 39 ] . Finally , machine - learning - guided directed evolution has been applied in protein engineering to enable the optimization of protein functions in a data driven manner [ 107 ] . Longstand - ing campaigns around protein structure design have success - fully been used to design new biosensors [ 109 ] . 4 . 5 . Design of New - to - Nature Components for Engineering Biosensors in Plants . The engineering of synthetic plant - based biosensors requires components that allow for sensing , signal processing , and output [ 98 ] . The synthetic plant - based biosensors consist of orthogonal components that function 13 BioDesign Research independent from the plant endogenous signaling pathway or network . A synthetic promoter can be designed by combining a core promoter region with signal - responsive motifs serving as the sensing module for a transcriptional - based biosensor [ 98 , 110 ] . The most widely used core promoter is the minimal CaMV 35S promoter . Currently , three databases , PLACE , PlantCARE , and TRANSFAC , are available for the selection of cis - regulatory elements with known functions [ 110 ] . AI - based frameworks are being applied for promoter anal - ysis and prediction in plants [ 111 , 112 ] . The TSSP - TCM was the ﬁ rst tool to predict and identify plant promoters using the support vector machine ( SVM ) algorithm [ 113 ] . Cur - rently , many computational tools of plant promoter predic - tion have been developed [ 114 – 116 ] . The PromPredict program using DNA degree of stability features of promoter regions showed accurate promoter prediction in Arabidopsis and rice genomes [ 117 ] . AI - based frameworks for de novo promoter design and prediction have also been developed in E . coli [ 118 , 119 ] . These AI - based frameworks lay the founda - tion for the future promoter design work in plants . The conserved phytohormone - responsive and stress - inducible cis elements have been identi ﬁ ed via overlapping results of various bioinformatical tools [ 33 , 120 – 122 ] . Another useful class of biological components is based on synthetic transcription factors ( TFs ) . Utilizing DNA - binding domains and activation domains from di ﬀ erent organisms , synthetic TFs have been constructed . For instance , the tran - scription activator - like e ﬀ ectors ( TALEs ) , dead Cas9 fused with VP64 , and others , have been used to build synthetic TFs in plants [ 110 , 123 ] . In addition to synthetic sensory modules , synthetic reporters are also important for engineering plant - based bio - sensors . Although the FPs and luciferase can generate facile readout signals , the requirement of ﬂ uorescence microscopes and expensive substrate limited the use of these reporters . Cur - rently , several synthetic reporters that can overcome these lim - itations have been developed for plant system . For instance , the synthetic RUBY reporter , including all the enzymes for betalain biosynthesis , has been generated to visualize transgenic events [ 99 ] . A fungal bioluminescence pathway ( FBP ) can create lumi - nescence in planta without additional substrate addition [ 124 ] . 4 . 6 . The Challenges Speci ﬁ c to Constructing a Multicellular Biosensor to Monitor the Environment . One of the advantages of using plants to build sensors for environmental monitoring is their ability to change morphology . Plant tissues and cells deeply penetrate the soil and extend up into the air , enabling them to sample the environment broadly and continuously . While this morpho - physiology is bene ﬁ cial for sampling , it creates unique challenges for the implementation of GEPBs . For example , if a signal is sensed in one or a few cells in the plant , only those cells would report it . Thus , unless every cell was monitored continuously , which is impractical and infeasi - ble , the detected signal would be invisible . Additionally , if the signal was perceived in cells that were hidden from view , such as roots in soil , the signal would not be visible unless the plant was excavated . These challenges indicate that biosensors need to be created with systems capable of amplifying reporter sig - nals and transmitting them throughout the plant . Signal ampli ﬁ cation is essential to convert signal percep - tion in a subset of cells in the plant to a response that is eas - ily measured . There are several synthetic signaling systems that have been developed , such as transcriptional feedback loops [ 125 ] and engineered kinase cascades [ 126 , 127 ] , that can be used to engineer systemic reporter signal ampli ﬁ ca - tion . However , such systems would need to be calibrated to prevent auto - activation or a loss of correlation between the strength of a signal and the reporter output . Once locally ampli ﬁ ed , this signal would also need to be transmitted to regions of the plant that were accessible to measurement for the plant - based biosensor to be useful . Engineering the mobility of reporter signal through the plant could be imple - mented at either the RNA or protein level . At the RNA level , fusion of tRNA - like sequences to messenger RNAs has been demonstrated to confer systemic mobility to them , enabling transport through the phloem [ 128 , 129 ] . This strategy has been utilized by groups to both confer mobility to reporters across graft junctions and to enhance the mobility of viral vectors [ 128 , 129 ] . At the protein level , reporter mobility could be engineered by cloning domains from the move - ment proteins of plant viruses , which have evolved to enable such transport [ 130 ] . Both these strategies are generic and could be broadly applied to many di ﬀ erent reporters . 5 . Conclusion The goal of engineering for plant - based biosensors is to design and build biosensors with high speci ﬁ city and sensi - tivity . It would be ideal to engineer plant - based biosensors to re ﬂ ect real - time dynamics of analytes without the need for complicated equipment to detect the signal . In this review , we outline a general framework for engi - neering di ﬀ erent type of biosensors . We highlight representa - tive biological components ( e . g . , FPs , natural sensory modules , synthetic reporters , and synthetic sensory modules ) that have been successfully applied in plant - based biosensors design , and we conclude with a look to the future discussing synthetic sensory modules . The items listed in Tables 1 – 5 serve as a guide for gener - ating a more comprehensive catalog of biological compo - nents for GEPBs . We propose the following strategies for identi ﬁ cation and curation of more biological components for plant - based biosensor engineering : ( 1 ) Selecting the promoters of responsive genes to speci ﬁ c analytes , TFs responsive to speci ﬁ c signals , or proteins that interact with analytes from the literature to develop plant - based biosensors for speci ﬁ c analytes ( 2 ) Designing new synthetic biological components for plant - based biosensor engineering with de novo pro - tein design ( 3 ) Applying new natural or synthetic reporters with facile readout properties for plant - based biosensor engineering Currently , it is still a challenge to identify biological components in order to build reliable plant - based biosensors for various analytes . This is , in part , due to the fact that 14 BioDesign Research molecular events in plants are complicated and the function of many biological components still need further character - ization . Second , large genomic databases or resources are lacking for many plant species , which makes it di ﬃ cult to apply AI - based modeling for designing biological compo - nents for plant - based biosensor engineering . Third , high - throughput screening systems are also lacking in plants for validating new biological components for plant - based bio - sensor engineering . All these challenges represent substantial opportunities for future plant synthetic biology research . Additional e ﬀ orts are also needed in plant biotechnology , including improved CRISPR - based genome engineering , rapid transformation systems , and high - throughput pheno - typing systems , which would accelerate Design - Build - Test - Learn cycles for plant synthetic biology .
