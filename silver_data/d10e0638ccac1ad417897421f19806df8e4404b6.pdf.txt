Abstract Walled cells , such as plants , fungi , and bacteria cells , possess a high internal hydrostatic pressure , termed turgor pressure , that drives volume growth and determines cell shape . Rigorous measurement of turgor pressure , however , remains challenging , and reliable quantitative measurements , even in budding yeast are still lacking . Here , we present a simple and robust experimental approach to access turgor pressure in yeasts based upon the determination of isotonic concentration using protoplasts as osmometers . We propose three methods to identify the isotonic condition – 3D cell volume , cytoplasmic fluorophore intensity , and mobility of a cytGEMs nano - rheology probe – that all yield consistent values . Our results provide turgor pressure estimates of 1 . 0 ± 0 . 1 MPa for S . pombe , 0 . 49 ± 0 . 01 MPa for S . japonicus , 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 MPa for S . cerevisiae W303a and 0 . 31 ± 0 . 03 MPa for S . cerevisiae BY4741 . Large differences in turgor pressure and nano - rheology measurements between the S . cerevisiae strains demonstrate how fundamental biophysical parameters can vary even among wildtype strains of the same species . These side - by - side measurements of turgor pressure in multiple yeast species provide critical values for quantitative studies on cellular mechanics and comparative evolution . Introduction Turgor pressure is a primary determinant of mechanical properties of walled cells of various biological kingdoms including plants , fungi , bacteria , and protists ( Shabala , McMeekin , and Shabala 2009 ; Beauzamy , Nakayama , and Boudaoud 2014 ) . Turgor pressures also contribute to mechanical properties and cell shape determination in animal cell systems ( Jones et al . 2021 ; Vian et al . 2022 ) . Turgor pressure ( also known as hydrostatic pressure ) is the internal pressure relative to the outside environment of the cell ; this internal pressure arises largely from the concentration of osmotic solutes such as ions , amino acids , and small metabolites . It is generated by an inward flow of water from a low solute concentration media into the cell that contains a higher solute concentration . This osmotic swelling pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall . Consequently , the cell wall mechanically resists this turgor pressure ( Abenza et al . 2015 ) . Hence , there is an essential relationship between turgor pressure and cell wall mechanics . Turgor pressure provides the force to drive the volume expansion for cell growth and contributes to cell shape determination and cytokinesis ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ; Proctor et al . 2012 ; Chang and Huang 2014 ) . Walled cells harness turgor pressure to perform specific function , for example , some pathogenic fungi build appressoria that generate remarkably high turgor pressures that allows them to pierce and invade plant tissues or insects ( Emmett and Parbery 1975 ; Thilini Chethana et al . 2021 ) . High turgor in fungi may also help maintain cell shape and integrity in compressive or arid environments in their natural habitat such as biofilms , soil , or decaying vegetative material ( Mishra , Minc , and Peter 2022 ) . The internal pressure of the cell is highly relevant to membrane - based processes at the plasma membrane . For instance , turgor pressure generally opposes the invagination of the plasma membrane during endocytosis and cytokinesis , as membrane ingression proceed at faster rate when turgor is reduced ( Sun et al . 2019 ; Morris et al . 2019 ; Basu , Munteanu , and Chang 2013 ; Proctor et al . 2012 ; Lemière , Ren , and Berro 2021 ; Aghamohammadzadeh , Smaczynska - de Rooij , and Ayscough 2014 ) . There is currently a critical need for reasonable estimates of turgor for quantitative modelling of the mechanics of plasma membrane dynamics and actin structures at the cell surface . Mechanical - based models of endocytosis and cytokinesis all depend on turgor pressure as a key parameter . For instance , reliable estimates of turgor are required to estimate the force production of actin filaments at the endocytic pit for endocytosis ( Nickaeen et al . 2022 ; Dmitrieff and Nédélec 2015 ) . Experimental measurement of turgor pressures in various cell types however has been highly challenging . There is no singular standard method ; a variety of approaches for measuring turgor have been devised in different contexts and cell types and each has its caveats and challenges ( Beauzamy , Nakayama , and Boudaoud 2014 ) . In the literature , various approaches could yield a large range of values ( over one magnitude ) even in the same cell type . One gold standard technique used in very large plant cells is to insert an oil - filled capillary into the cell as a direct pressure gauge ( Tomos and Leigh 1999 ) . However , most cell types are not large enough or amenable to this sort of physical manipulation . Another approach involves using AFM - based cantilevers to press on the surface of cells and measure its resistance to displacement ( Tsugawa et al . 2022 ; Beauzamy , Derr , and Boudaoud 2015 ; Boulbitch 1998 ) . One drawback of these indentation approaches is that analyses are needed to deconvolve the mechanical properties of the cell wall from the internal turgor pressure . Another class of approaches rely on measuring how cell volume changes in responses to osmotic shifts in the media ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ) . These rely on accurate 3D measurements of cell volume , and requires characterization of the intrinsic mechanical properties of the cell wall and cell shape beforehand ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ) . Bacteria , fungi , plant cells , and zebrafish embryo measurements show that turgor pressure can approach megapascal values ( Beauzamy et al . 2015 ; Goldenbogen et al . 2016 ; Altenburg et al . 2019 ; Jiang and Sun 2010 ; Vian et al . 2022 ) ; with reported values in cultured mammalian cells being ten times lower . In fission yeast S . pombe , Minc et al . ( Minc , Boudaoud , and Chang 2009 ) used cell buckling , and Atilgan et al . ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ) used osmotic responses and modeling to arrive at consistent estimates in the range of 1 . 0 - 1 . 5MPa ( or ~ 10 - 15 atm or ~ 145 - 217 Psi ) . These studies suggest that the fission yeast cell has an internal pressure similar to a racing bike tire , with the cell wall having a stiffness of hard rubber of ~ 50 MPa ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ) . The published values for turgor pressure in S . cerevisiae however have been less consistent , with estimates ranging from 0 . 05 to 2 . 9 MPa ( Arnold and Lacy 1977 ; Martinez de Marañon , Marechal , and Gervais 1996 ; Meikle , Reed , and Gadd 2009 ; Goldenbogen et al . 2016 ) . Recent modeling of the endocytic pit derived from properties and organization of actin filaments and plasma membrane deformation back calculated a turgor pressure of 0 . 35 MPa ( Nickaeen et al . 2022 ) . Thus , accurate measurements of turgor pressure values in budding yeast are especially lacking . Here , we introduce an approach for measuring turgor pressure based upon osmotic responses in protoplasts ( yeast cells with their cell wall enzymatically removed ) . This method is based upon our previous findings that fission yeast protoplasts act as ideal osmometers ; their osmotic potential is equal to the osmotic potential in the media outside of the cell ( Lemière et al . 2022 ) . The general premise is that by tuning the outside osmotic environment we adjust the protoplasts internal osmotic potential . We then determine the external osmolarity required for protoplasts to match the internal osmotic potential of intact cells . The outside osmolarity at this isotonic point provides an estimate of turgor pressure ( Figure 1 ) . Here , we developed three different ways to quantitatively pinpoint this isotonic state based on cell volume , cellular concentration , and cytoplasmic rheology . The three orthogonal approaches are advantageous in that they do not rely on prior knowledge of cell shape or cell wall mechanical properties . We derive consistent turgor measurements for S . pombe , S . cerevisiae , and S . japonicus , an emerging fission yeast model cell which is ten - fold larger in volume than S . pombe . One surprising finding is that two wildtype S . cerevisiae strains – W303 and BY4741 , which represent the major strain backgrounds used in the field – differ in turgor pressure by almost two - fold , demonstrating how even " wildtype " cells of the same species can have substantial variability in their mechanical and osmotic properties . Results Protoplasts can be used as osmometers to gauge internal osmotic pressures . The isotonic condition is defined at the point where the water potential of a cell ( Ψ ! ) is equal to the medium water potential ( Ψ " ) at equilibrium . In first order , there is a direct relation between the cell water potential , the internal osmotic potential ( P # ) , and its turgor pressure ( P ) such that Ψ # = P − P # . This relation is usually simpler for the medium where only the concentration of solutes is considered such that Ψ $ = P % & ’’ ( ) . From these two equations , when cells are at equilibrium with the surrounding medium it comes a simple relation between the turgor pressure ( P ) and the difference of osmotic potential between the medium ( P % & ’’ ( ) ) and the cell ( P # ) : P = P # − P % & ’’ ( ) . The turgor pressure can then be seen as the mechanical resistance of the cell wall to expand due to the internal pression inside a yeast ( Figure 1 ) . Cells swell in hypotonic condition and shrink in hypertonic condition . From a mathematical point of view , this behavior comes from the fact that cells adjust their water potential to be at equilibrium with the surrounding medium . Because the membrane permeability is generally higher to water than to solutes cells adjust their water potential by exchanging water rather than solute ( Lang et al . 1998 ; Milo and Phillips 2015 ) . Hence , under osmotic shocks at short time scales ( < minute ) , the total amount of solute can be considered constant ( Yang and Hinner 2015 ) . Figure 1 . Representation of the turgor pressure measured with osmotic treatment . For intact cells in standard media , cells are in an isotonic condition in which pressures from the elastic cell wall ( P # ( * * , - * * ) plus the osmotic buffer of the medium ( ∏ % & ’’ ( ) ) counterbalance the internal pressure ( ∏ . / 0 ) . For protoplasts , the osmolarity of the external media causes the protoplast to increase or decrease in volume so that the internal osmotic pressure counterbalances pressure from external media . At isotonic condition , the internal pressure of the protoplast matches the internal pressure of the intact cell ∏ 1 ) 020 = ∏ . / 0 . This isotonic pressure point is achieved when volume of the protoplast matches the volume of the intact cell . Thus , the turgor pressure of the intact cell can be estimated from sorbitol concentration in the external media needed to achieve this isotonic point in the protoplast . buffer buffer ∏ Proto ( ) = ∏ sorbitol ( ) + ∏ buffer ( ) I n t a c t c e ll P r o t o p l a s t Hypotonic ∏ Proto < ∏ iso Hypertonic ∏ Proto > ∏ iso Isotonic ∏ Proto ∏ Proto = ∏ iso In isotonic condition ∏ iso = ∏ Proto Turgor pressure = ∏ sorbitol ∏ iso ∏ buffer ∏ buffer ∏ iso ( ) = P Cell Wall ( ) + ∏ buffer ( ) Cell wall Plasma membrane Cell wall pressure ( P ) Osmotic pressure ( ∏ ) buffer cell A particular case emerges when cells do not bear any turgor pressure ( P = 0 ) , such that the osmotic potential of the buffer and inside the cell are equal ( P # = P % & ’’ ( ) ) . In this case , cells behave like ideal osmometers , whose volume varies with external osmotic pressure ( Figure 1 ) . The volume of an ideal osmometer shows a linear relationship with the inverse of the osmolytes concentration in solution , following the Boyle Van’t Hoff relation : ( Nobel 1969 ) . Indeed , our recent study shows that S . pombe protoplasts exhibit such properties of an ideal osmometer ( Lemière et al . 2022 ) . We tested whether protoplasts from different yeast species all act as ideal osmometers . To measure cell volume , we imaged cells expressing a fluorescent plasma membrane protein marker ( mCherry - Psy1 for S . pombe , INA1 - GFP for both S . cerevisiae strains , and Mtl2 - mCherry for S . japonicus ( Figure 2A ) ) and determined their cellular volumes using a semi - automated 3D - segmentation tool ( Machado , Mercier , and Chiaruttini 2019 ) . When sorbitol was added to the growing medium , protoplasts decreased in volume . Inversely , reducing the amount of sorbitol swelled protoplasts to larger volumes . For each yeast strain , we plotted the volume of a population of protoplasts as a function of the inverse of the concentration in the medium ( Figure 2B , bottom panel ) . The Boyle Van’t Hoff plots for protoplasts showed a linear behavior for all the yeast strains tested , indicating that protoplasts in the different strains all behaved as ideal osmometers and do not bear detectable turgor pressure . We used protoplasts as ideal osmometers to determine the internal osmotic environment of intact cells . At the isotonic osmolarity , the volume of the protoplast matches the volume of the intact cell . Thus , to access turgor pressure , we measured the concentration of extracellular sorbitol needed to reach this isotonic state in the protoplast . In the following sections , we tested three approaches to determine this isotonic state . Measurement of turgor pressure with cell volume measurements First , we directly measured the volume of cells ( as described above , see Methods ) to determine the isotonic volume condition . We treated protoplasts with a range of sorbitol concentrations and measured their volume distributions . We then compared these volume distributions to the volume distributions of intact cells grown in media without sorbitol ( Figure 2B , top panel ) . Using the Boyle Van’t Hoff linear fit for protoplasts volume , we calculated the sorbitol concentration at which the mean volume of the protoplasts equaled the mean volume of intact cells ( Figure 2B ) ( Table 1 ) . We used the Van’t Hoff relation between the concentration of solute and the osmotic pressure P . / 0 = P % & ’’ ( ) = CRT , where RT is the product of the gas constant and the temperature ( K ) to access the turgor pressure . This method based upon 3D volume measurement yielded turgor pressures of 0 . 97±0 . 1 MPa for S . pombe , 0 . 48±0 . 06 MPa for S . japonicus , 0 . 64±0 . 07 MPa for S . cerevisiae W303a and 0 . 34±0 . 03 MPa for S . cerevisiae BY4741 ( Table 2 ) .

One drawback of the volume measurement approach described above is that it is based upon distributions in an asynchronous population , and thus care must be taken not to under sample . The measurement of intracellular intensity has the advantage of an intensive property : it does not depend on the number of cells assayed . Figure 3 .

Graphs show the cytoplasmic intensity distribution of a population of intact cells ( black whisker box ) compared with the intensity in protoplasts in media supplemented with indicated concentrations of sorbitol ( at least 2 replicates per condition , white dots mean values , N > 400 cells per strains ) . The higher sorbitol concentration leads to increased fluorescent intensity in the cells due to higher concentration of the cytoplasmic marker . Scale bar 5 µm . 0 . 6M 0 . 2M 0 . 7M 0 . 3M A ) 0 . 4M 0 . 1M 0 . 4M 0 . 1M B ) For each species we expressed a fluorescent cytoplasmic protein marker whose intensity did not vary through the cell cycle ( Figure 3A ) . We measured the fluorescence intensity of this fluorophore in a small region of interest within each cell or protoplast in a representative portion of the cytoplasm ( see Methods ) . In hypertonic conditions for instance , the mean intensities of the cytoplasmic fluorophore increased as the protoplasts volume decreased , while intensities decreased in hypotonic conditions when the protoplasts swelled ( Figure 3B top panel ) ( Molines et al . 2022 ; Lemière et al . 2022 ) . We monitored the fluorescence intensities in a population of protoplasts in their growth medium supplemented by various concentrations of sorbitol and compared these to intensities in intact cells . We calculated the sorbitol concentrations that lead the intensity in protoplast to match that in intact cells in the isotonic condition ( Table 1 ) . Using this method , we retrieved similar turgor pressures for all species . We found a turgor pressure of 0 . 95±0 . 1 MPa for S . pombe , 0 . 50±0 . 06 MPa for S . japonicus , 0 . 43±0 . 03 MPa for S . cerevisiae W303a and 0 . 27±0 . 02 MPa for S . cerevisiae BY4741 ( Table 2 ) . Measurement of turgor pressure using nano - rheology The third method of determining the isotonic condition consisted of using nanorheology to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm ( D eff ) . As probes to measure diffusion coefficients , we expressed 40 - nm sized genetically - encoded multimeric cytoplasmic nanoparticles ( cytGEMs ) labelled with mSapphire - fluorescent protein ( Delarue et al . 2018 ; Lemière et al . 2022 ; Molines et al . 2022 ) . The mobility of cytGEMs in S . pombe protoplasts follows a physical model of self - diffusive particles in a polymer solution ( Phillies 1988 ; Lemière et al . 2022 ) , yielding a model that quantitatively relates D eff with sorbitol concentration and cell volume during osmotic shifts experiments . We expressed cytGEMs in the S . pombe and S . cerevisiae strains , but unfortunately , were not successful in introducing it in S . japonicus . We quantified cytGEMs mobility in each population of exponentially growing intact cells in their respective media at 30°C . For WT S . pombe , D ( ’’304 % ( = 0 . 40 µm 2 / s , similar to values previously reported ( Lemière et al . 2022 ; Molines et al . 2022 ) . For S . cerevisiae strains , cytGEMs mobility for BY4741 was D ( ’’567879 = 0 . 36 ± 0 . 01 µm 2 / s while for the W303 background D ( ’’ , : ; : < = 0 . 24 ± 0 . 01 µm 2 / s . These statistically significant differences ( Mann - Whitney test , p < 0 . 0001 ) suggest that diffusion is slower in W303 than in BY4741 and S . pombe . We then determined the mobility of cytGEMs for protoplasts in media supplemented by various concentration of sorbitol . We found that the mobility of cytGEMs in S . pombe protoplasts and S . cerevisiae both fit a physical model that related D eff to sorbitol concentration ( Phillies 1988 ; Lemière et al . 2022 ) ( Figure 4B ) . Using this model , we calculated the sorbitol concentration needed to match cytGEMs mobility in the population of protoplasts with intact cells in the isotonic condition . Using this nano - rheology method , we calculated turgor pressure values : 1 . 09±0 . 09 MPa for S . pombe , 0 . 51±0 . 03 MPa for S . cerevisiae W303a and 0 . 32±0 . 02 MPa for S . cerevisiae BY4741 . Table 2 lists the collective results for the three experimental approaches in S . pombe , S . japonicus , and S . cerevisiae . S . pombe displayed the highest turgor pressure of the group , with the values consistent with recent measurements using other approaches Figure 4 .

As each methods carried its own technical challenges , it was reassuring that the values were relatively consistent across the different methods without apparent systematic biases . Thus , these results establish these methods as robust approaches for the measurement of turgor pressure .

This approach is based upon determining the isotonic environment that maintains the normal volume and cytoplasmic concentration in protoplasts compared to intact cells . Three methods for determining the isotonic protoplast volume – by measuring cell volume , cytoplasmic concentration , and nano - rheology – all yielded similar values , demonstrating the robustness of this approach . This study establishes turgor pressure values for S . cerevisiae ( 0 . 3 - 0 . 6 MPa ) and S . japonicus ( ~ 0 . 5 MPa ) and S . pombe ( ~ 1 . 0 MPa ) ( Table 2 ) . These values represent a significant advance for the quantitative understanding of cell mechanics and have broad implications in determining forces in processes such as cell shape , cell size and growth , cytokinesis , and endocytosis . As these measurements were obtained together using the same methods , they provide a robust comparison between these species and strain background . Our methods have advantages over other approaches such as osmotic shifts or cantilever indentation on walled cells ( Routier - Kierzkowska et al . 2012 ; Atilgan et al . 2015 ) in that they do not depend on cell shape or detailed knowledge of cell wall - surface mechanical properties . Rather than trying to derive absolute values , our approach relies on matching values of the intact cell to a calibrated standard curve based on protoplasts . Each of these three approaches to determine the iso - osmotic concentration of protoplasts compared to walled cells has its experimental advantages and challenges , depending on the expertise and local resources of the user . For 3D volume measurements , there are recognized challenges in segmentation for volume calculations and a need for large sample size to obtain distributions in asynchronous cells . Fluorescence intensity measurements depend on careful microscope calibrations and are sensitive to microscopy conditions ( Methods ) . Measurements of cytGEMs mobility , which might currently be the most robust of these , require the introduction of cytGEMs into cells , an imaging system suitable for rapid acquisition ( 10 - 30 frames per second ) and tracking analyses . Our protocol utilizes protoplasts because they are ideal osmometers , in contrast to cells with intact cell walls which are not . However , the use of protoplasts comes with a potential caveat that during the procedure to generate them , cells may alter their internal osmolarity by synthesizing intracellular glycerol in response to stress . A number of observations suggest though that the internal osmolarity does not change during the protoplasting procedure . First , the turgor pressure values we obtain from fission yeast protoplasts are consistent with previous measurements using different approaches in intact cells ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ; Minc , Boudaoud , and Chang 2009 ) . Second , fission yeast gpd1 mutant protoplasts , which are defective in the synthesis of glycerol in response to osmotic stress , display similar turgor pressures and cytGEMs diffusion to WT cells using this method ( Lemière et al . 2022 ) . Our comparison between the two fission yeast species S . pom be and S . japonicus provides insights into how various mechanical parameters are altered to accommodate changes in cell sizes during evolution . The stress on the cell wall , for instance , is dependent on the radius of the cell ( see Methods ) . S . japonicus has a similar rod - shape as S . pombe but is 2 - fold larger in cell width and ~ 10 - fold larger in volume . The S . japonicus cell wall is approximately two times thicker than that in S . pombe ( Davì et al . 2019 ) . Experiments on measuring cellular dimensions upon cell lysis indicate that these species have similar cell wall elastic strain ( Davì et al . 2019 ) . Our measurements show that S . japonicus has two times less turgor pressure compared to S . pombe ( Table 2 ) . These values suggest that the cell wall in both fission yeasts support a similar tension of ~ 1N / m ( see Methods ) . These values allow us to derive a Young’s modulus ( elasticity ) of the lateral cell wall to be Y ~ 50 MPa for S . pombe ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ) and ~ 25 MPa for S . japonicus . Thus , the ten - fold larger S . japonicus has similar cell wall tension as S . pombe , produced by half the turgor pressure that is supported by a thicker and more flexible cell wall . One of the most unexpected findings was the approximately two - fold differences in turgor pressure and cytGEMs diffusion between two widely used S . cerevisiae strains BY4741 and W303 . BY4741 is a derivative of the S228c strain that was used for the reference genome sequencing ( Brachmann et al . 1998 ; Mortimer and Johnston 1986 ) . W303 is derived from multiple backgrounds and has substantial regions of the genome that originate from strains not related to S288c ( Rogowska - Wrzesinska et al . 2001 ; Rothstein and Sherman 1980b , 1980a ) . Comparison of the genome sequences of W303 and S228c strains show about 8000 nucleotide differences , predictive of amino acid changes in about 800 proteins ( Ralser et al . 2012 ; Matheson , Parsons , and Gammie 2017 ) . Numerous phenotypic differences between the strains have been noted , including cell size , salt tolerance , and maximal life span ( Petrezselyova , Zahradka , and Sychrova 2010 ; Cohen and Engelberg 2007 ; Zadrag - Tecza et al . 2009 ) ( also see Figure 2A ) . The phenotypic differences in these two strains provides an opportunity to dissect molecular factors that regulate turgor pressure and cytoplasmic crowding . For instance , according to the Saccharomyces Genome Database , W303 carries an extra gene copy of ENA / PMR2 ( Cherry et al . 2012 ) , which encodes plasma membrane ATPase pumps that regulates ion homeostasis which likely affects turgor pressure ( Wieland et al . 1995 ) . GEMs diffusion is thought to reflect the concentration of macromolecular crowding agents such as ribosomes ( Delarue et al . 2018 ) rather than small molecules in the cytoplasm responsible for turgor pressure determination . Thus , W303 might have a more dilute cytoplasm with lower concentration of macromolecules . At present , it is unclear whether this significant difference in cytGEMs diffusion is somehow linked to the turgor pressure effect or is an independent effect . Despite these physical differences , these yeast strains have both been selected to be robustly healthy and fast growing , at least in laboratory conditions . Although it has been long assumed that cells need to maintain optimal levels of turgor pressure and cytoplasmic properties ( Minton 1981 ) , our findings suggest that there may not be a specific optimal level of turgor pressure and crowding , even within cells of the same species . Differences in turgor pressure and diffusion are however predicted to give rise to many physical and molecular differences driving biological processes such as endocytosis , cell growth , and cell size . Indeed , according to theory developed by Nickaenn et al . ( Nickaeen et al . 2022 ) , differences in turgor pressure predict that endocytosis may occur more quickly and require more actin in S . cerevisiae W303A than in BY4741 , and similar differences in S . pombe compared to S . japonicus . Indeed , turgor pressure and rheological differences may begin to explain sources of variability between strains in the literature . The establishment of robust assays will stimulate further quantitative studies into the regulation of cell rheology and mechanics and their effects on cellular functions . Materials and Methods Yeast strains and media Strains used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 3 . S . pombe strains are derived from WT 972 and S . japonicus strain is derived from NIG5091 . Primers used to insert tagged genes are listed in Supplemental Table S2 . For S . pombe and budding yeast , transformations were done with Lithium Acetate - based methods ( Longtine et al . 1998 ; Bähler et al . 1998 ) ( Table 4 ) . S . japonicus was transformed using an electroporation method ( Aoki and Niki 2017 ) . For expression of Cytoplasmic 40 - nm GEMs in S . pombe , Pfv encapsulin - mSapphire was expressed from a thiamine regulated nmt1 * promoter on a multicopy plasmid pREP41X - Pfv - GS - mSapphire ( Delarue et al . 2018 ; Molines et al . 2022 ; Lemière et al . 2022 ) . For S . cerevisiae W303A background , cytGEMs integrative vector ( # 116930 , pRS305 - Leu2 - PINO4 - PfV - GS - mSapphire , Addgene ) was inserted in the LEU2 locus after linearization with EcoRV restriction enzyme . As this strategy cannot apply to S . cerevisiae BY4741 strains as the LEU2 locus was completely deleted , we used a standard PCR - based method ( Bähler et al . 1998 ) to insert pINO4 : : Pfv - GS - mSapphire - LEU2 into the region of the deleted LEU2 using primers matching the flanking region of the LEU2 deleted site including the restriction site added when this strain was designed ( Brachmann et al . 1998 ) ( see Table 4 for primers ) . S . pombe and S . japonicus cells were grown in YES 225 ( # 2011 , Sunrise Science , San Diego CA , USA ) , S . cerevisiae cells were grown in YPD ( 10 g / L Bacto Yeast Extract , 20 g / L Bacto Peptone ( # 214010 and # 0118 - 17 - 0 , Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes NJ , USA , 20 g / L D - Glucose ( # 47263 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham MA , USA ) ) , all at 30°C in exponential phase for about 20 hr . For S . pombe strains carrying GEMs expression plasmids were grown in similar conditions in EMM3S – Edinburgh Minimum media ( # 4110 - 32 , MP Biomedicals , Burlingame CA , USA ) supplemented with 0 . 225 g / L of uracil , histidine , adenine , and 0 . 05 µg / mL of thiamine ( # U0750 , # H8000 , # A9126 , # T4625 , Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Louis MO , USA ) to maintain the plasmid .

S . pombe and S . japonicus cells were inoculated from fresh YES 225 agar plates ( YES 225 + 20g / L Difco Agar ( # 281210 , Fisher scientific ) ) into YES 225 or EMM3S liquid cultures and grown at 30 °C for about 20 h into exponential phase ( OD600 = 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 ) . Ten mL of cell culture was harvested by centrifugation 2 min at 400 rcf , washed two times with SCS buffer ( 20 mM sodium citrate , 20 mM citric acid , 1 M D - sorbitol , pH = 5 . 8 ) , resuspended in 1 mL of SCS buffer with 0 . 1 g / mL Lallzyme ( # EL011 - 2240 - 15 , Lallemand ) , and incubated with gentle inversion on a rotator for 10 min at 37 °C in the dark . The resulting protoplasts were gently washed once with 1 mL of SCS buffer using centrifugation for 2 min at 400 rcf . 900 μL of supernatant were removed , and the protoplasts in the pellet were gently resuspended in the remaining ~ 100 μL of solution . This protoplasting procedure took about 15 min . The S . cerevisiae protoplast protocol is similar to the one provided by MP Biomedicals white paper on Zymolyase . Cells were inoculated from fresh YPD agar plates ( YPD + 15g / L Bacto Agar ( # 214010 , Fisher Scientific ) ) into liquid YPD and grown in exponential phase for 20 hours at 30°C . 15 mL of cells was harvested at 4000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 300 µL of TE Buffer ( 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM EDTA ) . 400 µL of water and 3 . 5 µL of beta - mercaptoethanol were added , and cells were incubated at 30°C with gentle shaking for 15 min . Cells were washed once , centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min . and resuspended in 800 µL of S buffer ( 1 M sorbitol , 10 mM PIPES ) . 8 µL of 100T Zymolyases from Arthrobacter luteus ( # E1004 , Zymo Research , Irvine CA , USA ) was added , and cells were incubated at 30°C with gentle inversion on a rotator for 30 min . Protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation ( 5000 rpm , 5 min ) and resuspended in S buffer . This protoplasting procedure took about 1 hour . Microscopy Cells were imaged on a Ti - Eclipse inverted microscope ( Nikon Instruments , Melville , NY , U . S . A ) with a spinning - disk confocal system ( Yokogawa CSU - 10 ) that includes 488 nm and 541 nm laser illumination Borealis system and emission filters 525±25 nm and 600±25 nm respectively , a 60 X ( NA : 1 . 4 ) objective , and an EM - CCD camera ( Hamamatsu , C9100 - 13 ) . These components were controlled with μManager v . 1 . 41 ( A . Edelstein et al . 2010 ; A . D . Edelstein et al . 2014 ) . Temperature was maintained by a black panel cage incubation system ( # 748 – 3040 , OkoLab , Sewickley - PA , USA ) . For imaging of GEMs , live cells were imaged using highly inclined laser beam illumination on a TIRF Diskovery system ( Andor , Concord , MA 01742 , USA ) with a Ti - Eclipse inverted microscope stand ( Nikon Instruments ) , 488 nm laser illumination , a 60 X TIRF oil objective ( NA : 1 . 49 , oil DIC N2 ) ( # MRD01691 , Nikon ) , and a sCMOS camera ( Zyla , Andor ) , controlled with μManager v . 1 . 41 ( A . Edelstein et al . 2010 ; A . D . Edelstein et al . 2014 ) . Temperature was maintained by a black panel cage incubation system at 30°C ( # 748 - 3040 , OkoLab ) . 500 images were acquired at 100 fps with 10 ms exposure time with no interval time . Cells were mounted in μ - Slide VI 0 . 4 channel slides ( # 80606 , Ibidi – 6 channels slide , channel height 0 . 4 mm , length 17 mm , and width 3 . 8 mm , tissue culture treated and sterilized ) . For S . pombe and S . japonicus cells and protoplasts , the μ - Slide channel was pre - coated by incubation with 100 μg / mL of lectin from soybean ( # L1395 , Sigma ) for at least 15 min at room temperature . For S . cerevisiae cells and protoplasts , μ - Slide channels were coated with 1 mg / mL of concanavalin A ( # L7647 , Sigma ) until dried and could be stored at 4°C for days . Cells were introduced into the chamber already mounted under the microscope , incubated for 5 min to let them sediment and adhere to the chamber . The chamber was then washed three times , in less than a minute , to remove non - adhered cells . The media used for these washes and the final media contained the growth medium ( YES 225 or YPD ) with various amount of sorbitol . Then up to 5 different fields of view for each strain were acquired in < 1 min . 3D volume measurements Cell volumes were measured by imaging cells expressing plasma membrane markers . For S . pombe we used mCherry - Psy1 ( Kashiwazaki et al . 2011 ) ; for S . japonicus Mtl2 - mCherry ( Davì et al . 2018 ) ; for S . cerevisiae Ina1 - GFP ( Huh et al . 2003 ) . Z stack images ( 0 . 5 μm z - slices ) that spanned the entire cell volume were obtained using spinning disk confocal microscopy . The 3D volumes were segmented using an ImageJ 3D image segmentation tool LimeSeg ( Machado , Mercier , and Chiaruttini 2019 ; Schneider , Rasband , and Eliceiri 2012 ) . Cytoplasmic marker intensity measurements A fluorescent cytoplasmic protein marker was expressed in each of the yeast strains S . pombe ( m - Crimson ) , S . japonicus ( GFP ) , and S . cerevisiae ( td - Tomato ) . Cells were imaged with a spinning - disk confocal system only once to avoid photobleaching . Multiple fields of view were acquired per condition . The distance between the air - glass interface and the objective was locked during the entire set of experiments for a given μ - Slide . The cytoplasmic intensity was measured for each cells using the mean fluorescence intensity of a ROI manually selected at a given Z - position in the cells avoiding the vacuoles and corrected by the mean fluorescence of the background . To calibrate and normalize the intensity of our measurement throughout days and samples , at the beginning of each set of experiments for a given strain , a population of intact cells was imaged and analyzed in the exact same conditions ( same laser intensity , exposure time and Z - position ) . Intensities of that intact cell population , for a given strain , was then used to normalize the set of experiments on protoplasts of the same strain for a given μ - Slide channel ( the 5 other channels ) such that one ibidi µ - Slide was used per strain and per replicates . This calibration was done for each µ - Slide and strains imaged . cytGEMs analyses methods . cytGEMs were tracked with the ImageJ Particle Tracker 2D - 3D tracking algorithm from MosaicSuite ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos 2005 ) with the following parameters : run ( " Particle Tracker 2D / 3D " , " radius = 3 cutoff = 0 per / abs = 0 . 03 link = 1 displacement = 6 dynamics = Brownian " ) . The analyses of the GEMs tracks were as described in ( Delarue et al . 2018 ; Lemière et al . 2022 ) , with methods to compute mean square displacement ( MSD ) using MATLAB ( MATLAB _ R2018 , MathWorks ) . The effective diffusion D eff was obtained by fitting the first 10 time points of the MSD curve ( MSD truncated ) to the canonical 2D diffusion law for Brownian motion : MSD truncated ( 𝜏 ) = 4D eff 𝜏 . Turgor pressure calculation For the 3D Volume method , we fitted our data of protoplast volumes at various sorbitol concentrations to the Boyle Van’t Hoff equation for an ideal osmometer V = 4 ! # " # $ $ % & + b ; ( Figure 2B , colored lines ) where V is the volume of protoplast , C % & ’’ ( ) the concentration of the medium , m ; the apparent number of osmotically active particles , b ; the non - osmotic volume . m ; , b ; were parameters that were fitted to minimize the sum squares of the residues . Data from at least two experimental replicates were combined to generate these fits . Intact cells volume was the average value ( ±SD ) of the median of the volume distribution of a population of cells from two replicates . The turgor pressure ( Tables 1 , 2 ) was derived from estimating the sorbitol concentration in the Boyle Van’t Hoff plots that provided the equivalent median volume as in the intact cell population ( Figure 2B ) . The estimated errors ( Table 1 , 2 ) were computed by combining the variance of the fit from the protoplast data and the SD of median intact cell volume . For cytoplasmic intensity method , we fitted the fluorescence intensity data in protoplasts at various sorbitol concentrations ( Figure 3 ) to a simple linear regression close to the intensity values in the intact cells . The mean turgor pressure ( Tables 1 , 2 ) was estimated as the sorbitol concentration in the fitted equation that produced the equivalent mean fluorescence in the intact cell population . The estimated errors ( Table 1 , 2 ) were computed by combining the variance of the fit from the protoplast data with the variance of mean distributions of intact cell fluorescence intensity between replicates . For the rheology method , we fit the measured D eff ( effective diffusion coefficient ) of 40 - nm cytGEMs in protoplasts at various sorbitol concentrations to the Phillies equation 𝐷 ? @ @ = 𝐷 ; 𝑒 AB ( ! D ! ! ) , where 𝐷 ; = 13 . 56 µm 2 / s is the diffusion of a 40 nm spherical particle in water calculated using the Stokes - Einstein equation , C ; the concentration of the medium , 𝐶 the concentration of sorbitol ( Figure 4 ) ( see ( Lemière et al . 2022 ) ) . The fit was derived from fitting the mean D eff values from the combined data from all replicates . The mean turgor pressure ( Tables 1 , 2 ) was estimated as the sorbitol concentration in the Phillies fit that produced the equivalent mean D eff in the intact cell population . The estimated errors ( Table 1 , 2 ) were computed by combining the variance of the fit from the protoplast data with the standard error of the mean of intact cell D eff of all the tracks . For the Average values ( Table1 , 2 , bottom rows ) , means of each of the three methods were reported , with the errors as the SD between these three values . To compute the turgor pressure ( P ) from the concentration of sorbitol ( C ) , we used the Van’t Hoff relation , P = CRT , where RT is the product of the gas constant , and the temperature is 303 . 15 K ( 30°C ) . Cell wall Young modulus and tension To calculate the lateral cell wall modulus of fission yeasts we built upon the theoretical framework developed by ( Atilgan et al . 2015 ) . This framework assumes that the cell wall for S . pombe and S . japonicus is homogeneous and isotropic , which leads to a force balance equation that links the physical parameter of the cell to the elastic strain of the lateral cell wall : ΔP . R 𝑌ℎ = 𝜀 Where ΔP is the turgor pressure , and Y the Young modulus of the cell wall . We also used physical parameters for both fission yeast from ( Davì et al . 2019 ) , the measurements of the cell radius ( R Japonicus = 2 R Pombe ) , cell wall thickness ( h Japonicus = 2 h Pombe ) and elastic strain ( ε Japonicus = ε Pombe = 30 % ) . From the equation above and the differences in size between the two fission yeast species parameters it comes that : 𝑌 FGHIJKLMN = 1 2 Y OIPQ ? The cell wall tension ( T ) for a rod shape can be calculated following this equation : T = ΔP . R S . japonicus radius is twice S . pombe radius ( R Japonicus = 2 R Pombe ) , but the turgor pressure bared by the former is only half of S . pombe turgor pressure ( ΔP Japonicus = 9 R ΔP Pombe ) . It leads to : T FGHIJKLMN = T OIPQ ? Acknowledgments We are grateful to members of Fred Chang ' s lab as well as labs of Sophie Dumont , Orion Weiner , and David Drubin for helpful discussions .
