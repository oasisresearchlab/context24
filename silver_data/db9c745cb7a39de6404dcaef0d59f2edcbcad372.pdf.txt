Accordingly , the present decade has been labeled the Decade of the Spine to emphasize the importance of SCI and other spinal disorders . Spinal cord injury may be divided into both primary and secondary mechanisms of injury . The pri - mary injury , in large part , determines a given patient’s neurologic grade on admission and thereby is the strongest prognostic indicator . However , secondary mechanisms of injury can exacerbate damage and limit restorative processes , and hence , contribute to overall morbidity and mortality . A burgeoning body of evidence has facilitated our un - derstanding of these secondary mechanisms of injury that are amenable to pharmaco - logical interventions , unlike the primary injury itself . Secondary mechanisms of injury encompass an array of perturbances and include neurogenic shock , vascular insults such as hemorrhage and ischemia – reperfusion , excitotoxicity , calcium - mediated secondary injury and fluid – electrolyte disturbances , immunologic injury , apoptosis , disturbances in mitochondrion function , and other miscellaneous processes . Comprehension of sec - ondary mechanisms of injury serves as a basis for the development and application of targeted pharmacological strategies to confer neuroprotection and restoration while mitigating ongoing neural injury . The first article in this series will comprehensively review the pathophysiology of SCI while emphasizing those mechanisms for which pharmacologic therapy has been developed , and the second article reviews the pharma - cologic interventions for SCI . Key Words : Spinal cord injury—Secondary injury— Pathophysiologic mechanisms Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) may be defined as an injury resulting from an insult inflicted on the spinal cord that compromises , either completely or incompletely , its major functions ( motor , sensory , autonomic , and re - flex ) . Spinal cord injury remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in modern society . An esti - mated 8 , 000 – 10 , 000 people experience traumatic SCI in the United States each year ( 1 – 6 ) . In addition to its cost to the individual physically as well as the health care system and society financially , SCI has profound psychosocial effects that are devastating for patients , families , and friends . A basic understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury is of para - mount importance to facilitate comprehension of phar - macological interventions . These pharmacological strategies are largely targeted at attenuating or elimi - nating the effects of secondary injury mechanisms . Ad - ditionally , an appreciation of these pathophysiologic mechanisms in SCI has further relevance , because many , if not all , of these processes are common to other insults of the central nervous system such as head injury , cerebral ischemia , and subarachnoid hemor - rhage ( 7 – 9 ) . The pathophysiology of acute SCI comprises both primary and secondary mechanisms of injury . The prognosis for recovery after SCI has been closely ex - amined ( 10 – 18 ) . The extent of the primary injury may group patients with SCI into severity categories ( neu - rologic grades ) .

Nonetheless , for a large majority of patients with SCI , the extent of secondary injury evokes further damage , limits restorative processes , and predicts their long - term morbidity . Therefore , a full understanding of secondary injury mechanisms in SCI facilitates the development of targeted inter - ventions . In the following passages , pathophysiologic mechanisms of spinal cord injury are reviewed , with special attention to secondary injuries against which pharmacologic therapies have been postulated and applied . PRIMARY INJURY There are four characteristic mechanisms of primary injury : ( i ) impact plus persistent compression ; ( ii ) im - pact alone with transient compression ; ( iii ) distraction ; and ( iv ) laceration / transection . The first and most com - mon mechanism involves impact plus persistent com - pression ( 9 , 19 ) . This is evident in burst fractures with retropulsed bone fragment ( s ) compressing the cord , fracture - dislocations , and acute disc ruptures . The sec - ond mechanism involves impact alone with only tran - sient compressions as observed with hyperextension injuries in individuals with underlying degenerative cervical spine disease . Distraction , forcible stretching of the spinal column in the axial plane , provides a third mechanism and becomes apparent when distractional forces resulting from flexion , extension , rotation , or disclocation produce shearing or stretching of the spi - nal cord and / or its blood supply . This type of injury may underlie SCI without radiological abnormality , es - pecially in children where cartilaginous vertebral bod - ies , underdeveloped musculature , and ligament laxity are predisposing factors ( 20 ) . This type of injury may also be a causative factor in SCI without radiologic evi - dence of trauma , which is a syndrome most common in adults with underlying degenerative spine disease ( 9 ) . Laceration and transection comprise the final primary mechanism of injury . Laceration of the spinal cord may result from missile injury , sharp bone fragment dislocation , or severe distraction . Laceration may oc - cur to varying degrees , from minor injury to complete transection . Thus , primary mechanisms of injury in - clude impact plus persistent compression , impact alone with only transient compression , distraction , and laceration / transection . The initial mechanical insult tends to damage pri - marily the central gray matter , with relative sparing of the white matter , especially peripherally . This in - creased propensity for damage to the gray matter has been speculated to be a result of its softer consistency and greater vascularity ( 21 ) . Evidence of hemorrhage within the spinal cord develops early , and blood flow within the spinal cord is later disrupted after the initial mechanical injury . Disruption in blood flow results in local infarction caused by hypoxia and ischemia . This is particularly damaging to the gray matter because of its high metabolic requirement . Neurons that pass through the injury site are physically disrupted and ex - hibit diminished myelin thickness ( 22 ) . Nerve trans - mission may be further disrupted by microhemorrhages or edema near the injury site ( 23 – 25 ) . It is thought that the gray matter is irreversibly damaged within the first hour after injury , whereas the white matter is irrevers - ibly damaged within 72 hours after injury . ( 26 ) SECONDARY INJURY The primary mechanical injury serves as the nidus from which additional secondary mechanisms of injury extend . These secondary mechanisms include neuro - genic shock , vascular insults such as hemorrhage and ischemia – reperfusion , excitotoxicity , calcium - medi - ated secondary injury and fluid - electrolyte distur - bances , immunologic injury , apoptosis , disturbances in mitochondrion function , and other miscellaneous pro - cesses ( Figs . 1 , 2 ) . Neurogenic Shock Spinal cord injury may result in neurogenic shock . Although there are several interpretations of this term , it is defined in this context as inadequate tissue perfu - sion caused by serious paralysis of vasomotor input ( thereby producing deleterious disruption of the bal - ance of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor influences to the arterioles and venules ) . It is characterized by bra - dycardia and hypotension with decreased peripheral re - sistance and depressed cardiac output ( 27 ) . These ef - fects have been linked to underlying abnormalities such as decreased sympathetic tone , depressed myocardial function from increased vagal tone , and possibly sec - ondary changes in the heart itself ( 27 , 28 ) . If untreated , the systemic effects of neurogenic shock ( namely , is - chemia of the spinal cord and other organs ) may exac - erbate neural tissue damage . Vascular Insults : Hemorrhage and Ischemia – Reperfusion As alluded to previously , vascular insult has delete - rious effects on the spinal cord , both initially at the time of injury and subsequent to this . These vascular injuries produce both hemorrhagic and ischemic damage . The microcirculation , especially venules and capillaries , PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SPINAL CORD INJURY 255 Clin . Neuropharmacol . , Vol . 24 , No . 5 , 2001 appears to be damaged at the site of injury and for some distance rostrally and caudally because of initial me - chanical trauma . There appears to be a relative sparing of larger vessels such as the anterior spinal artery from direct mechanical injury ( 29 – 33 ) . This damage results in small areas of hemorrhage , or petechiae , that prog - ress to hemorrhagic necrosis with time . Numerous experimental studies have documented a progressive “posttraumatic ischemia” as measured by various methods of spinal cord blood flow determina - tion ( 32 , 33 ) . Vasospasm resulting from direct trauma and possibly some other inciting agent ( s ) ( 32 , 33 ) has been demonstrated to occur ( 30 , 31 ) . Additionally , in - travascular thrombosis may also contribute to this post - traumatic ischemia ( 34 , 35 ) . Other investigators have noted abnormalities in autoregulatory homeostasis ( i . e . , a decreased ability to maintain constant blood flow over a wide range of pressures ) that may worsen ischemia resulting from systemic hypoperfusion ( neu - rogenic shock ) or may worsen hemorrhage with gross elevations in systemic blood pressure ( 9 ) . Therefore , vascular insult in SCI results in hemorrhage , likely from underlying mechanical disruption of vessels and loss of microcirculation and disruption of autoregula - tion . Ischemia is also a product of this vascular insult and is likely secondary to diminished blood flow from thrombosis , vasospasm , and loss of microcirculation or systemic hypoperfusion with loss of autoregulatory ho - meostasis . The stage of reduced perfusion discussed above may precede a period of hyperemia or “luxury perfusion” . This is postulated to arise from a reduction in perivas - cular pH from accumulation of acidic metabolites such as lactate ( 36 ) . Such reperfusion may exacerbate injury and cellular death through the genesis of deleterious free radicals and other toxic byproducts ( 37 , 38 ) . Oxy - gen - derived free radicals ( including superoxide , hy - droxyl radicals , and nitric oxide and other high - energy oxidants ( including peroxynitrite ) are produced during ischemia ( 39 – 52 ) with a most pronounced rise during FIG . 1 . The mechanisms underlying injury after spinal cord trauma are depicted , emphasizing the central importance of ischemia , increased intracellular calcium , and apoptosis in cell death . Each of these boxes represents potential avenues for pharmacologic intervention . R . J . DUMONT ET AL . 256 Clin . Neuropharmacol . , Vol . 24 , No . 5 , 2001 the early reperfusion period ( 47 – 49 , 52 – 55 ) . These highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species contribute to oxidative stress , a pathological mechanism that con - tributes to the secondary injury of spinal cord trauma . They are generated via multiple cellular pathways in - cluding nitric oxide synthases , calcium - mediated acti - vation of phospholipases , xanthine oxidase , inflamma - tory cells , and the Fenton and Haber - Weiss reactions ( 37 ) . When oxidative stress exceeds the protective cel - lular antioxidant capacity , as can be the case in neuro - trauma , the net production of these reactive molecules subsequently gives rise to oxidation of proteins , lipids , and nucleic acids ( 37 , 43 ) . More specifically , such mol - ecules mediate the inactivation of mitochondrial respi - ratory chain enzymes , inactivation of glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , inhibition of Na + - K + ATPase , inactivation of sodium membrane channels , and other oxidative perturbations of key proteins , in ad - dition to initiation of lipid peroxidation and its delete - rious sequelae . Oxidative stress has commonalities with other pathogenic mechanisms imparting injury from spinal cord trauma . It has been linked to calcium overload , mitochondrial cytochrome c release , caspase activation , apoptosis , and excitotoxicity ( 43 ) . In sum - mary , it is clear that oxidative stress resulting from the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen molecules contributes to SCI and is intimately related to other me - diators of secondary injury . Excitotoxicity Biochemical derangements and concomitant fluid – electrolyte disturbances appear to assume a central role as a secondary mechanism of injury in acute SCI . Ex - citatory neurotransmitters are released and accumulate ( 56 ) , and this has been hypothesized to produce direct damage to spinal cord tissue ( 57 – 59 ) in addition to in - direct damage from production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and from alterations in microcircula - tory function and secondary ischemia . Glutamate , the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the central ner - vous system ( CNS ) ( 60 ) , is released excessively after FIG . 2 . The mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury are illustrated , with emphasis on the role of local influences . The role of vascular disturbances , interstitial edema and cord compression , glutamate release , and inflammation are demonstrated . These boxes represent foci that may be particularly amenable to pharmacologic modulation . PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SPINAL CORD INJURY 257 Clin . Neuropharmacol . , Vol . 24 , No . 5 , 2001 injury . This accumulation may result in direct and in - direct damage as described above . However , others have asserted that glutamate cell receptor activation ( especially activation of the N - methyl - D - aspartate [ NMDA ] and AMPA - kainate ( (cid:1) - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methylisoxazole - 4 - propionate - kainate ) receptor sub - types ( 61 , 62 ) may be critical in the production of is - chemic damage ( 28 ) . Olney ( 63 ) introduced the term “excitotoxicity” to describe those processes resulting from excessive activation of glutamate receptors lead - ing to neuronal injury . Excitotoxicity has assumed a central position in the description of mechanisms of CNS injury . Glutamate receptor activation appears to result in early accumulation of intracellular sodium ( 64 ) , producing subsequent cytotoxic edema and intra - cellular acidosis . Failure of the Na + - K + ATPase may further exacerbate the intracellular accumulation of so - dium and water and the extracellular loss of potassium ( 65 ) . Additionally , intracellular calcium accumulates [ in part , through activation of the Na + - Ca 2 + exchanger ( 66 ) ] which , in turn , produces profound alterations in physiology and subsequent damage . In fact , accumula - tion of intracellular calcium has been denoted the “final common pathway of toxic cell death” in the CNS ( 67 , 68 ) . Glutamate neurotoxicity is also mediated by the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species . Excitotoxicity , particularly mediated by the NMDA re - ceptor , initiates a complex cascade of events that ulti - mately results in the genesis of reactive molecules that contribute to neuronal death through a variety of mechanisms including initiation of lipid peroxidation , inhibition of Na + - K + ATPase activity , inactivation of membrane sodium channels , direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes , inactivation of glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , and other oxidative modifications of important proteins ( 37 , 69 – 77 ) . Calcium - Mediated Secondary Injury and Fluid – Electrolyte Disturbances High intracellular calcium concentrations contribute to secondary damage through various mechanisms . One of these mechanisms entails interference with mi - tochondrial function ( 78 , 79 ) . This interference inhibits cellular respiration , which has already been impaired by the hypoxia and ischemia secondary to the initial injury . Increased intracellular calcium also stimulates an array of calcium - dependent proteases and lipases , such as calpains , phospholipase A2 , lipoxygenase , and cyclooxygenase ( 1 ) . Calpain activity and expression is increased in activated glial and inflammatory cells in the penumbra of SCI lesions in experimental SCI ( 80 ) . Calpains can degrade important structural constitu - ents in the CNS including structural proteins of the axon – myelin unit ( 80 ) . Additionally , other calcium - dependent proteases and kinases destroy cell mem - branes and result in dissolution of certain components of the cell ultrastructure such as neurofilaments . Li - pase , lipoxygenase , and cyclooxygenase activation re - sults in the conversion of arachidonic acid into certain thromboxanes , prostaglandins , and leukotrienes , and increased levels of these metabolites may occur in as - sociation with spinal cord trauma within minutes of in - jury ( 81 – 83 ) . There also appears to be a delayed rise in arachidonic acid approximately 24 hours after injury that is associated with inhibition of the Na + - K + ATPase and tissue edema ( 84 ) . There appears to be a persistent accumulation of cyclooxygenase - 1 ( COX - 1 ) express - ing microglia / macrophages and upregulation of COX - 1 expression by the endothelium after experi - mental SCI ( 85 ) . These substances produced by the conversion of arachidonic acid contribute to reduced blood flow by causing platelet aggregation and vaso - constriction ( 78 ) . They can also contribute to an in - flammatory response and lipid peroxidation . In addi - tion to the obvious damage to cellular membranes , lipid peroxidation results in a repetitive cycle that in - volves the production of free radicals . These radicals continue to damage membranes , resulting in further lipid peroxidation and free radical formation . This cycle continues unless stopped by endogenous antioxi - dants such as (cid:1) - tocopherol ( vitamin E ) and superoxide dismutase ( 78 ) . Cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) has been studied re - cently as a putative contributor to secondary injury . Cy - clooxygenase - 2 mRNA and protein expression is in - duced after experimental SCI ( 86 ) . It may represent a common substrate linking membrane damage and ex - citotoxicity in SCI . It is well known that Ca 2 + influx can elicit activation of membrane - associated phospholi - pases and the liberation of arachidonic acid . Increased extracellular excitatory neurotransmitters evoke neuro - nal activation and results in the induction of COX - 2 expression in cortical neurons ( 87 ) . Consequently , neu - ronal death may result by direct toxicity . Indeed , selec - tive inhibition of COX - 2 improves outcome after spinal cord insult in preliminary animal investigation ( 25 , 86 ) . Electrolyte changes , such as the accumulation of in - tracellular sodium and calcium , have been outlined above . Increased extracellular potassium appears to re - sult in excessive depolarization of neurons , which ad - versely affects neuronal conduction and may , in fact , be the critical causative factor underlying spinal shock ( 88 ) . Another electrolyte disturbance that has received less attention is magnesium depletion . Depletion of in - tracellular magnesium can have a deleterious effect on metabolic processes such as glycolysis , oxidative phos - R . J . DUMONT ET AL . 258 Clin . Neuropharmacol . , Vol . 24 , No . 5 , 2001 phorylation , and protein synthesis , as well as adversely affecting certain enzymatic reactions in which magne - sium serves as a cofactor . Magnesium depletion can also further contribute to intracellular calcium accumu - lation and the associated pathophysiological processes outlined above ( 78 ) . Magnesium is thought to also pro - tect neuronal cells by blocking the NMDA receptor of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter ion channel , thereby theoretically diminishing excitotoxicity ( 8 ) . Additionally , magnesium can modulate the binding of endogenous opioids and may alter the resulting aberra - tions in physiology ( 89 ) . Immunologic Secondary Injury SCI also evokes changes in activity of certain cells of the CNS . Some classes of glial cells help to maintain homeostasis in the CNS by various mechanisms includ - ing regulation of excitatory amino acid levels and pH . After SCI , regulation of homeostasis by these glial cells fails , possibly contributing to tissue acidosis and the excitotoxic process ( 90 ) . Other glial cells may release certain compounds that can affect neural outgrowth . These compounds include neurotrophic growth factors that can reestablish the disrupted neuronal network by stimulating the reactive sprouting of spared neurons ( 91 ) and inhibitory factors that can counteract this ac - tivity . Still other glial cells , which function in removing cellular debris after CNS injury , have increased activity of certain oxidative and lysosomal enzymes that can cause further cellular damage ( 90 ) . There is a biphasic leukocyte response after trauma to the spinal cord . Initially , infiltration of neutrophils predominates . The subsequent release of lytic enzymes by these leukocytes may exacerbate injury to neurons , glia , and blood vessels ( 92 ) . The second phase involves the recruitment and migration of macrophages , which phagocytose damaged tissue . There are data to suggest that immunologic activa - tion promotes progressive tissue injury and / or inhibits neural regeneration after injury to the CNS . However , the functional significance of some immune cells within the lesioned spinal cord is controversial ( 93 ) . Macrophages and microglia have been regarded as in - tegral components of neural regeneration , whereas oth - ers propose that these cells contribute to oligodendro - cyte lysis ( by a process involving tumor necrosis fac - tor - (cid:1) and nitric oxide production ) ( 94 ) , neuronal death , and demyelination ( 8 ) . It has been shown that direct contusion to the spinal cord results in sensitization of the host immune system to a component of CNS myelin ( 93 ) . It is postulated that the two aforementioned phases of leukocyte infiltration ( and the pathophysi - ological processes that accompany this ) contribute to the demyelination of spared axons beginning within the first 24 hours after the primary insult and peaking dur - ing the next several days ( 92 ) . This process contributes to discernible areas of cavitation within the gray and white matter . Wallerian degeneration also becomes ap - parent and scarring subsequently ensues . Scarring is primarily mediated by astrocytes and other glia in ad - dition to fibroblasts ( 92 ) . Given this preamble , processes underlying recruit - ment of leukocytes to the site of injury is particularly relevant from a putative therapeutic standpoint . Re - cruitment of immune cells to the injured CNS is orches - trated by multiple families of proteins . One such me - diator is intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) . ICAM - 1 contributes to immune responses by promot - ing infiltration of neutrophils into tissues . However , its role in the secondary damage after acute SCI has not been well defined . ICAM - 1 involvement in secondary injury after SCI is implicated by the demonstration that a specific monoclonal antibody against ICAM - 1 sig - nificantly suppressed myeloperoxidase activity , re - duced spinal cord edema , and also improved spinal cord blood flow ( 95 ) . Further evidence supporting a contribution of ICAM - 1 in secondary SCI is raised by experiments involving ICAM - knockout mice . In these studies , neutrophil recruitment is reduced ( 96 ) and mo - tor function recovery is enhanced after spinal cord con - tusional injury ( 97 ) . Other important mediators of im - mune cell recruitment , and thus further targets for in - tervention in treating secondary injury in SCI , include other adhesion molecules such as P - selectin , and cyto - kines including interleukin - 1 (cid:2) , interleukin - 6 , and tu - mor necrosis factor ( 97 – 99 ) . Importantly , interleukin - 10 has been shown to reduce production of tumor ne - crosis factor and thereby exert an inhibitory influence on activation of monocytes and other immune cells af - ter SCI ( 100 , 101 ) . Other chemotactic agents such as chemokines and their receptors are upregulated after SCI and contribute to cellular infiltration and second - ary injury ( 102 ) . Chemokine antagonism therefore may represent another area for intervention to reduce the in - flammatory response and its associated deleterious ef - fects ( 102 ) . Another intriguing line of investigation has demonstrated that traumatic SCI induces nuclear fac - tor - kappaB activation ( 103 ) . Nuclear factor - kappaB represents a family of transcription factors that are re - quired for the transcriptional activation of a variety of genes regulating inflammatory , proliferative , and cell death responses of cells ( 103 ) . Further elucidation of the precise immune mechanisms and their relative con - tributions to secondary injury after SCI is warranted . Modulation of the immune response elicited by SCI is important as a potential therapeutic target in attenuat - ing secondary injury . PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SPINAL CORD INJURY 259 Clin . Neuropharmacol . , Vol . 24 , No . 5 , 2001 Apoptosis In recent years , programmed pathways of neuronal death have been implicated in the pathobiology of mul - tiple neurologic disorders including SCI . Apoptosis can be triggered by a variety of insults including cyto - kines , inflammatory injury , free radical damage , and excitotoxicity . Recently , the existence of apoptosis af - ter traumatic human SCI was confirmed ( 104 ) . In addi - tion , recent data from experimental rodent models of SCI lends credence to the assertion that apoptosis ( par - ticularly activation of caspases ) contributes signifi - cantly to SCI ( 105 – 108 ) . The apoptotic cascade in SCI is activated in neurons , oligodendrocytes , microglia , and perhaps , astrocytes . Apoptosis in microglia contributes to inflammatory secondary injury ( 109 ) . Experimental work suggests that apoptosis in oligodendrocytes contributes to postinjury demyelination developing during the first several weeks after SCI ( 110 , 111 ) . Apoptosis in neu - rons contributes to cell loss that has a clear negative impact on outcome ( 112 ) . Apoptosis in neurons after SCI occurs via both the extrinsic , mediated by Fas li - gand and Fas receptor ( 99 , 113 ) and / or inducible nitric oxide synthase production by macrophages ( 114 ) , and intrinsic , via direct caspase - 3 proenzyme activation ( 115 ) and / or mitochondrial damage , release of cyto - chrome c and activation of the inducer caspase - 9 , ( 108 ) pathways of caspase - mediated apoptotic death ( 112 ) . Furthermore , recent evidence suggests that caspase in - hibitors may be yet another target for therapeutic inter - vention in SCI secondary injury ( 112 ) . Two main pathways of apoptosis—extrinsic or re - ceptor - dependent and intrinsic or receptor - indepen - dent—have been well characterized , and both appear to be active in SCI . Receptor - dependent apoptosis is evoked by extracellular signals , the most significant of which is tumor necrosis factor , hence the designation of “extrinsic” pathway . Tumor necrosis factor is known to rapidly accumulate in the injured spinal cord , and acti - vation of the Fas receptor of neurons , microglia , and oligodendrocytes induces a programmed sequence of caspase activation involving caspase - 8 as the inducer caspase and caspase - 3 and caspase - 6 as the effector caspases ( 116 ) . Activation of effector caspases results in the demise of the affected cell . An alternative in - ducer of the extrinsic pathway is inducible nitric oxide synthase , which also ultimately brings about caspase - 3 activation to effect programmed cell death ( 114 ) . The receptor - independent pathway is activated by intracel - lular signals , and is thus termed the “intrinsic” path - way . Activation of the receptor - independent pathway has been described in neurons after SCI wherein high intraneuronal calcium concentrations induce mito - chondrial damage , cytochrome c release , and subse - quent activation of an alternative programmed se - quence of caspase activation ( 116 ) . In this sequence , cytochrome c couples with apoptosis activating fac - tor - 1 to activate caspase - 9 , the inducer caspase , which , as in the extrinsic pathway , activates caspase - 3 and caspase - 6 as the effector caspases , likewise culminat - ing in the death of the affected neuron ( 117 , 118 ) . Apo - ptotic secondary injury in SCI has only recently come under close scrutiny , and the precise contribution and potential therapeutic implications of apoptosis in SCI await further clarification . Role of the Mitochondrion in Secondary Injury Mitochondria may represent a central contributor to cellular death after SCI . A multitude of previously dis - cussed mechanisms of secondary injury involve the mi - tochondrion in some capacity . In health , mitochondria are critical in cerebral metabolism and in maintenance of cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis . The mitochondria also serve as hosts to a vast array of oxidation - reduction reactions using oxygen and hence , also comprise the primary intracellular source of reactive oxygen spe - cies . The orchestration of cellular metabolic flux ( neu - ronal - astrocyte trafficking ) is also critically dependent on mitochondria ( 79 ) . Compromise in any of these functions served by mitochondria can lead to death directly or indirectly by diminishing tolerance to cellu - lar stress . Trauma to the CNS perturbs the ability of mitochondria to carry out cellular respiration and oxi - dative phosphorylation ( 119 – 123 ) . Traumatic injury to the CNS also alters respiration - dependent Ca 2 + uptake / sequestration by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca 2 + transport and hence disturbs intracellular Ca 2 + homeo - stasis ( 119 – 121 , 123 ) . Additionally , Ca 2 + - induced per - meability changes of the mitochondrial inner mem - brane are observed in cellular death . Such changes re - duce the mitochondrial membrane potential and may contribute to osmotic swelling and mitochondrial lysis ( 124 ) . Moreover , this change in Ca 2 + permeability rep - resents a potential therapeutic target . For example , cy - closporine A , an agent capable of inhibiting Ca 2 + - induced mitochondrial permeability changes , is neuro - protective as discussed in Part II of this series ( 124 , 125 ) . Mitochondria appear to be important in cel - lular damage from accumulation of excitatory neuro - transmitters after traumatic injury . A burgeoning body of evidence demonstrates that mitochondria actively sequester the majority of Ca 2 + entering neurons with excitotoxicity . Indeed , excessive mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation as opposed to simply increased cytosolic Ca 2 + , is the principal cause of excitotoxic cell death R . J . DUMONT ET AL . 260 Clin . Neuropharmacol . , Vol . 24 , No . 5 , 2001 ( 126 – 130 ) . In addition to excitotoxicity , mechanical stress , inflammatory reactions , and altered trophic sig - nal transduction appear to contribute to mitochondrial damage with CNS trauma . In addition , increased per - meability of the mitochondria’s outer membrane to apoptogenic proteins facilitates their release into the cytosol , thereby representing a key mechanism in the induction of apoptosis and neuronal death . Overall , the mitochondrion is increasingly becoming recognized as an integral mediator of traumatic neural injury . Myriad potential therapeutic points of intervention may be ex - tracted from knowledge of the mitochondrion’s contri - bution to secondary injury . Other Contributors to Secondary Injury Levels of certain peptides and neurotransmitters change following the primary injury . In particular , there is a rise in endogenous opioids after injury . Opi - oid receptor activation can contribute to the excitotoxic process described earlier ( 131 ) . Activation of µ and (cid:3) opioid receptors can prolong the excitotoxic process . Activation of (cid:4) receptors can exacerbate decreases in blood flow and promote the excitotoxic process ( 65 ) . Levels of certain neurotransmitters , such as acetylcho - line and 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT , serotonin ) , also rise . 5 - HT may contribute to secondary damage by causing vasoconstriction and promoting platelet activa - tion and endothelial permeability ( 90 ) . CONCLUSION In summary , the pathophysiology of acute SCI in - volves both primary and secondary mechanisms of in - jury . Treatment of primary injury has not proven to be amenable to pharmacologic methods of treatment at present . However , prevention and education through programs such as the Think First program , show prom - ise for reducing the incidence of SCI and the enormous associated morbidity and mortality . Secondary mecha - nisms of injury encompass an array of pathophysi - ologic processes including neurogenic shock , vascular insults such as hemorrhage and ischemia - reperfusion , excitotoxicity , calcium - mediated secondary injury and fluid - electrolyte disturbances , immunologic injury , ap - optosis , disturbances in mitochondrion function , and other miscellaneous processes . The secondary mecha - nisms of injury are currently the target of pharmaco - logic management . An understanding of the basic sec - ondary pathophysiologic processes outlined above pro - vides the basis for current pharmacotherapy , and in addition , provides a framework for the development of new pharmacologic treatment strategies .
