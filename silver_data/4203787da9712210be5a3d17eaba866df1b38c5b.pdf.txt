It is modulated by , and can modulate , membrane traf ﬁ cking . However , the cellular pathway ( s ) involved in this interplay is poorly understood . Here we ﬁ nd that , among a number of endocytic processes operating simultaneously at the cell surface , a dynamin independent pathway , the CLIC / GEEC ( CG ) pathway , is rapidly and speci ﬁ cally upregulated upon a sudden reduction of tension . More - over , inhibition ( activation ) of the CG pathway results in lower ( higher ) membrane tension . However , alteration in membrane tension does not directly modulate CG endocytosis . This requires vinculin , a mechano - transducer recruited to focal adhesion in adherent cells . Vin - culin acts by controlling the levels of a key regulator of the CG pathway , GBF1 , at the plasma membrane . Thus , the CG pathway directly regulates membrane tension and is in turn con - trolled via a mechano - chemical feedback inhibition , potentially leading to homeostatic reg - ulation of membrane tension in adherent cells .

Cells respond to changes in ten - sion , passively by creating membrane invaginations / blebs 6 – 8 , and actively by modulating cytoskeletal – membrane connections , mechanosensitive channels and membrane traf ﬁ cking 4 , 9 , 10 . Membrane traf ﬁ cking through endo – exocytic processes can respond to and modulate membrane tension 10 . While exocytosis acts to reduce plasma membrane tension as a consequence of increasing net membrane area , endocytosis could function to reduce membrane area and enhance membrane tension . Membrane tension has long been shown to affect the endocytic process . Decreasing tension by the stimulation of secretion or addition of amphiphilic compounds increases endocytosis 11 , 12 . On the other hand , an increase in tension upon hypotonic shock 11 or as evinced during mitosis 12 , results in a decrease in endocytosis . Although many studies suggest that endocytosis responds to changes in membrane tension , the speci ﬁ c endocytic mechanisms involved in these responses have not been elucidated . We have recently shown that upon relaxing the externally induced strain on cells , tubule - like membrane invaginations termed ‘ reservoirs ’ are created 6 . This is purely a passive mechanical response of the plasma membrane following which cells deploy active cellular processes to resorb the excess mem - brane ( cartoon : Fig . 1a ) . Here we explore the nature of such active responses . We test the role of multiple endocytic pathways on modulation of membrane tension by three different approaches .

Vinculin , a protein involved in mechanotransduction 13 , regulates this tension - mediated modulation of endocytosis in adherent cells .

Results A rapid endocytic response to changes in membrane tension . Active cellular processes are involved in resorbing the ‘ reservoirs ’ formed following a strain relaxation 6 . To determine whether endocytosis could be one such active process , we monitored the extent of endocytosis by providing a timed pulse of a ﬂ uid - phase marker , ﬂ uorescent - dextran ( F - Dex ) , during and immediately after the stretch – relax procedure ( using a custom built stretch device 6 shown in Fig . 1b ) . Compared to cells at steady state , there was a marked increase in ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis immediately after relaxation of the areal strain ( Fig . 1c ) , while uptake was markedly reduced during strain application ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . This increase in endocytosis was transient and dis - appeared as early as 90 s after strain relaxation ( Fig . 1c ) . This also corresponds to the time scale of resorption of reservoirs by an active process observed earlier 6 . By rapidly upregulating endo - cytosis , cells thus respond to a net decrease in tension in a fast , transient fashion and return swiftly to a steady state . Exocytosis delivers membrane rapidly in response to increased membrane tension during cell spreading 14 . On de - adhering , cells round off decreasing their surface area , while on replating , cells spread by adding membrane . Thus , we hypothesized that upregulation of endocytic pathways may help retrieve membrane on de - adhering due to a decrease in net membrane tension 8 , 15 . We monitored endocytosis of F - Dex during and immediately after the de - adhering and compared it to that measured in the spread state ( Fig . 1d schematic ) . We found that the net ﬂ uid - phase uptake increased during de - adhering but subsided back to the steady - state level once de - adhered and held in suspension ( Fig . 1d ) . The observed increase in endocytic uptake during the de - adhering process was not due to the accumulation of endocytosed cargo due to a recycling block ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . To further consolidate our ﬁ ndings , we used an alternate method to modulate membrane tension . We shifted cells from hypotonic to isotonic medium , which made passive invaginations similar to reservoirs called vacuole - like dilations ( VLDs ) 6 . This alternate method also results in an enhancement of ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Together , these results suggested that using multiple strategies to reduce membrane tension triggered a fast and transient endocytic response . Response of multiple endocytic pathways to membrane ten - sion . A number of endocytic pathways function concurrently at the cell surface 16 – 19 . In addition to the well - characterized clathrin - mediated endocytic ( CME ) pathway , there are pathways that are independent of clathrin but utilize dynamin for vesicle pinching 18 , 20 . Additionally , there are clathrin - and dynamin - independent pathways which function in a number of cell lines 21 – 23 , but not in all 24 . The CLIC / GEEC ( clathrin - indepen - dent carrier / GPI - anchored protein - enriched early endosomal compartment ) pathway is a clathrin - and dynamin - independent pathway , responsible for the internalization of a major fraction of the ﬂ uid phase and several glycophosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins ( GPI – AP ) 21 , 23 as well as other plasma mem - brane proteins such as CD44 25 . To ascertain which of the mul - tiple endocytic pathways respond to changes in tension , we examined speci ﬁ c cargo and regulators of these distinct pathways . The endocytic uptake of the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , a marker of CME , did not increase in the cells which exhibited a transient rise in the ﬂ uid phase after a hypotonic shock ( Fig . 2a ) or detachment ( Fig . 2b ) as visualized using two - color ﬂ uorescence microscopy . However , uptake of the folate receptor , a GPI – AP that is internalized via the CG pathway 26 , 27 , exhibited a considerable increase ( Fig . 2c ) . This indicated that perhaps clathrin - independent endocytosis rather than CME might be involved in the fast response to a decrease in membrane tension . To rule out clathrin - independent but dynamin - dependent endocytic pathways 18 , 21 , we tested whether the increase in ﬂ uid - phase uptake required dynamin . We used a conditional triple knockout ( TKO ) cell line that removes all three dynamin isoforms from the genome 28 , thereby abolishing all the dynamin - mediated endocytic pathways ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . This dynamin TKO mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts ( MEFs ) exhibited higher steady - state ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis as reported earlier 28 . Despite this , TKO cells also transiently increased their ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis upon both stretch – relax cycles to the same extent as wild - type ( WT ) MEFs ( Fig . 3a ) and hypotonic / isotonic media changes ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Thus , neither CME nor dynamin - dependent endocytic pathways appear to respond to an acute reduction in membrane tension . A caveolin - dependent endocytic process is important to retrieve specialized membrane on de - adhering 29 , and a caveolae - mediated passive mechanism is reported to buffer the rapid increase in membrane tension and prevent cell lysis triggered by the ﬂ attening of caveolae 7 , 30 . To test if caveolin - dependent endocytic mechanisms could be important for this rapid endocytic upregulation , caveolin - null MEFs were subjected to the stretch – relax protocol . These cells exhibited a transient increase in ﬂ uid - phase uptake similar to their WT controls ( Fig . 3a ) . In addition , caveolin - null cells also exhibit a fast transient upregulation of ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis during de - adhering as well ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . We next examined the morphology of the endocytic carriers formed by reduction of membrane tension induced by de - adhering using electron microscopy ( EM ) . For this , we utilized cholera toxin bound horseradish peroxidase ( CTxB - HRP ) , which is an excellent marker of the internalized plasma membrane . We used a procedure in which the surface remnant peroxidase reaction product is quenched with ascorbic acid , revealing only the internalized CTxB - HRP - labeled membrane 25 . After 5 min post de - adhering , the major endocytic structures labeled had the typical morphology of CG carriers ( or CLICs ) comprising structures with tubular and ring - shaped morphology ( arrows , Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Morphologically identical structures were also observed in WT MEFs at steady state 31 and in caveolin - null MEFs ( arrows , Supplementary Fig . 3a ) consistent with the observation of fast ﬂ uid - phase uptake in caveolin - null cells via CG ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . At this time point , surface - connected caveolae ( containing no peroxidase reaction product ) persist in the WT MEFs ( arrowheads , Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , consistent with the possibility that the caveolar pathway does not play a signi ﬁ cant role in transiently modulating endocytosis at these early times of de - adhering . To further understand the nature of endosomes on reducing tension , we imaged the ﬂ uid uptake in cells following a hypotonic shock at high resolution . Cells form larger endosomes on recovering from hypotonic shock ( Supplementary Fig 3b ) and the number of endosomes also increases ( Supplementary Fig 3c , 3d and Supplementary Movie 1 , 2 ) .

This endocytic response is clathrin , dynamin and caveolin independent , and tracks the ﬂ uid - phase or GPI - anchored protein uptake which is endocytosed via the CG pathway . CG - mediated endocytosis is a high - capacity pathway capable of internalizing the equivalent of the entire plasma membrane area in 12 min 25 , and of recycling a large fraction of endocytosed material 32 . Thus , the CG pathway could be involved in responding to tension by rapidly increasing endocytic capacity to endocytose a large portion of excess membrane for homeostasis . The CG pathway responds to alterations in membrane tension . Since the CG cargo uptake negatively correlates with changes in tension , we explored this ﬁ nding in further detail . The CG pathway is regulated by the small GTPases , ARF1 , its guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) GBF1 , and CDC42 at the plasma membrane 27 , 33 , 34 . Hence , we utilized small - molecule inhibitors of CDC42 and GBF1 to acutely inhibit CG pathway 35 , 36 . The CDC42 inhibitor ML141 decreased ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis in cells at steady state but not CME ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , and prevented the increase in ﬂ uid - phase uptake upon de - adhering ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Next , we utilized LG186 , an inhibitor of GBF1 , which also decreased ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis in cells at steady state but does not affect CME ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Inhibiting GBF1 prevents the increase in ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis observed upon stretch – relax ( Fig . 3b ) or de - adhering ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Similar to the decrease in ﬂ uid phase on increasing tension during stretch ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , CD44 , a CG pathway - speci ﬁ c cargo , shows reduced endocytosis during hypotonic shock ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . To con ﬁ rm that this response is due to CG endocytosis , we assessed the effect of the stretch – relax protocol on cells that lack a b c Deadh Spread F l u i d N o r m a li z ed up t a k e on deadhe r i ng Transferrin Fluid ns * 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 Iso Hypo – Iso F l u i d * ns N o r m a li z ed up t a k e on h y po – I s o Transferrin Fluid 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 Spread Deadh G P I – AP N o r m a li z ed up t a k e on deadhe r i ng Transferrin GPI – AP ns * 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 7 . 0 Fig . 2 Endocytic pathways differ in their response to decrease in tension . a Fluid - phase and transferrin uptake in CHO cells under isotonic conditions ( Iso ) or immediately after shifting from the hypotonic to isotonic state ( Hypo – Iso ) by incubating cells with A647 - Tf ( Transferrin ) or TMR - Dex ( Fluid ) .

HeLa cells lack a robust CG endocytic pathway 24 , 26 and use CME as the major endocytic pathway 24 . To con ﬁ rm this , we downregulated CME with adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) 37 in these cells . AP2 shRNA caused a decrease in both TfR endocytosis and ﬂ uid uptake in HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . In contrast , AP2 shRNA treatment of AGS cells that exhibit a bona ﬁ de CG pathway 38 only reduced TfR uptake while ﬂ uid uptake was increased ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5b ) . While the molecular basis for this defect is not understood , we ﬁ nd that ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis in HeLa cells is insensitive to GBF1 inhibition by LG186 ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . GBF1 is recruited to the plasma membrane as punctae in CHO cells 34 and in AGS 38 cells that exhibit robust CG endocytosis . However , Hela cells do not show an obvious recruitment of GBF1 to the plasma membrane compared to CHO cells ( Supplementary Fig 5d / e ) . Correspondingly , the Hela cells did not exhibit a rapid increase in ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis on a hypotonic to isotonic shift ( Supplementary Fig . 5f and 5g ) . a b Stretch relax Control W T M E F D y n T K O C a v – / – N o r m a li z ed f l u i d up t a k e 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 WT MEF * 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 Cav – / – * 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 Control Stretchrelax Dyn TKO * Control S t r e t c h r e l a x S t ead y s t a t e LG186 Stretch - relax Steadystate N o r m a li z ed f l u i d up t a k e ns 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 Stretch - relax Steadystate * Control LG186 Fig . 3 CG pathway is the primary pathway for fast endocytic response . a Fluid uptake in wild - type ( WT MEF ) , caveolin - null ( Cav − / − ) or conditional Dynamin triple knockout MEFs ( Dyn TKO ) for 90 s using TMR - Dex at steady state ( control ) and immediately after relaxing the stretch ( stretch – relax ) .

Cells lacking this protein show reduced ﬂ uid uptake compared to IRSp53 - null cells restored with a wild - type version of IRSp53 . Consistent with a central role for the CG pathway in the rapid tension - triggered endocytosis , lowering membrane tension in IRSp53 - null cells failed to elicit the enhanced ﬂ uid - phase response , but the IRSp53 - restored cells exhibited a robust enhancement ( Supplementary Fig 6a ) . A recent study showed that HeLa cells do respond to decreases in membrane tension in a GRAF1 - dependent manner 39 . How - ever , we note that this occurred under much more drastic conditions of membrane tension / osmolarity perturbation . In the aforementioned study , cells were treated with > 6× diluted medium ( < 50 mOsm ) for 10 min , followed by a 10 min return to isosmotic conditions . In contrast , in our method we subject cells to a maximum of 2× diluted medium ( ~ 150 mOsm ) for 1 min , followed by a return to iso - osmolarity for a 1 min . Since the former treatment is an extreme hypotonic shock and for an extended period , we examined if similar to the HeLa , the CG - de ﬁ cient IRSp53 - null as well as the IRSp53 - WT addback line would respond to this regime . We ﬁ nd that all the cell lines ( with or without a bona ﬁ de CG pathway ) respond to this extreme osmotic shock ( Hypo 6× ) followed by a return to isotonic conditions by enhancing their ﬂ uid - phase uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 7a and b ) . These results suggest that extreme osmolarity changes are likely to trigger different mechanisms that may also function to restore membrane morphology , independent of the CG pathway . It should be emphasized that after the restoration period , the cells look distorted and in many cells the endosomes are present outside the bright - ﬁ eld image of the cell body ( arrows , Supplementary Fig . 7a and 7b ) , indicating a distinct form of membrane internalization whose detailed mechanism needs further investigation . In summary , the CG endocytic pathway is speci ﬁ cally involved in a rapid , transient response correlated to moderate changes in membrane tension . Passive and active response to changes in membrane tension . As mentioned above , upon a rapid reduction in membrane ten - sion , cells form passive structures such as reservoirs and VLDs similar to the response of an arti ﬁ cial vesicle . Reservoirs are formed upon strain relaxation in the membrane after stretching cells , whereas VLDs are formed by water expelled by the cell after a hypo - to - isotonic - shock recovery 6 . Both reservoirs and VLDs are reabsorbed and disappear within a couple of minutes , coin - cidental with an increase in endocytosis . This lead us to test if inhibiting the CG pathway could have a measurable impact on the rate of disappearance of such passive structures . The CG pathway exhibits exquisite temperature sensitivity and is barely functional at room temperature ( 25 °C ) , and is not ef ﬁ cient even at 30 °C unlike CME in CHO cells ( Fig . 4a ) . Correspondingly , the reservoir resorption in CHO cells was impaired after lowering temperature ( Fig . 4b ) . In addition , inhibition of the CG pathway in CHO cells by inhibiting GBF1 reduced the rate of reservoir reabsorption at 37 °C ( Fig . 4a ) . In contrast , HeLa cells lacking a characteristic CG pathway did not show any difference in the rate of disappearance of reservoirs upon inhibiting GBF1 and were much less affected by lowering of temperature than CHO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . Thus , the resorption of the reservoirs is partly due to an increase in CG endocytosis . We next examined if passively generated structures could help initiate endocytosis at the sites of their formation . The gradual disappearance of each reservoir indicates that it is not a single step process ( Fig . 4b ) , and therefore reservoirs are unlikely to be pinched off directly as endosomes . Further , we did not observe endosomes form at the site of the reservoirs ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . To test this , we took advantage of our earlier observation that cells plated on polyacrylamide gels do not form VLDs upon hypotonic to isotonic shifts 6 . Despite the lack of generation of VLDs in cells grown on polyacrylamide ( Supplementary Fig . 9b ) , they still showed an increase in endocytosis similar to when plated on glass , upon exposure to hypo - to - isotonic - shock procedure ( Supplementary Fig . 9c ) . Thus , VLD formation is not necessary for the endocytic response . Together , these data suggest that CG endocytosis occurs subsequent to the passive response by the membrane and the active response of the CG pathway does not depend on the passive morphological changes in the membrane exhibited by the cell . Role of the CG pathway in setting membrane tension . Since the CG endocytic pathway responded to changes in membrane ten - sion , we hypothesized that it might be involved in the setting of steady - state plasma membrane tension as well . To explore this hypothesis , we measured tether forces by pulling membrane tethers using optical tweezers in adherent cells 40 . The restoring force experienced by the bead associated with the membrane tethers provides a way to measure the plasma membrane ten - sion 41 ( Fig . 5a and Methods ) . Tether force is related to membrane tension by T ¼ F 20 = 8 B π 2 where F 0 is the tether force and B is the bending stiffness ( related to the force needed to bend a membrane of a given radius of curvature ) . Unlike in bare lipid vesicles , the membrane tension term from tether forces in cells is a combi - nation of in - plane membrane tension and membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion . It is dif ﬁ cult to separate out these contributions and therefore the restoring force measured by these optical trap experiments is referred to as apparent mem - brane tension or effective membrane tension 4 , 42 . We found that acutely inhibiting the CG pathway by GBF1 inhibition drastically reduced tether forces in adherent cells at steady state ( Fig . 5b ) . We next examined tether forces in cells where the CG pathway is upregulated . We reasoned that since the Dynamin TKO cells show a higher ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig 9d ) , it is likely that this would increase its effective membrane tension . Tether forces were indeed higher in the Dynamin TKO cells compared to control cells ( Fig . 5d ) . Consistent with the role of the CG pathway in setting effective membrane tension , inhibiting the CG pathway in Dynamin TKO cells by GBF1 inhibition ( Fig . 5c and Supple - mentary Fig 9d ) reduced the tether forces below control levels ( Fig . 5d ) . To further con ﬁ rm this observation , we measured tether forces on acutely increasing CG endocytosis by using Brefeldin A ( BFA ) as reported earlier 33 . BFA treatment disrupts endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to Golgi secretion and also serves to free up ARF1 , making it available at the cell surface to increase CG endocytosis 33 . This increase is mediated through GBF1 - sensitive CG endocytosis ( Fig . 5e ) . We treated cells with BFA and measured tether forces when the increase in endocytosis was most prominent . Tether forces were higher on treating cells with BFA compared to the control case ( Fig . 5g ) . Since BFA treatment also inhibits secretion 43 , this could also increase the effective membrane tension due to a reduction of membrane delivery from the secretory pathway , independent of its effect on CG endocytosis . To test this , we treated HeLa cells that lack the CG pathway with BFA . BFA treatment disrupted the Golgi in both CHO and HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 9e ) , consistent with its inhibition of the secretory pathway . However , neither ﬂ uid - phase uptake ( Fig . 5f ) nor the tether forces were affected in HeLa cells ( Fig . 5g ) . This indicated that the increase in tether force in CHO ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4217 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications cells upon BFA treatment is speci ﬁ cally due to an increase in CG endocytosis at these timescales . These results show that modulating the CG pathway by activating or inhibiting key regulators modi ﬁ es the membrane tension . Mechanical manipulation of the CG endocytosis machinery . We next tested if key regulatory molecules involved in different endocytic pathways could be directly modulated by changes in tension . GBF1 is involved in the CG pathway and re - localizes from the cytosol to distinct punctae at the plasma membrane upon activation as visualized using total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy 33 , 34 . We imaged GBF1 – GFP recruitment to the plasma membrane in live cells , during a hypotonic shock and after recovery , using TIRF microscopy . GBF1 punctae were lost on hypotonic shock ( Fig . 6a , b ) indi - cating a direct response by GBF1 on increasing tension . On the other hand , recovery from a hypotonic shock caused the rapid assembly of GBF1 punctae ( Fig . 6a , b ) . In contrast , clathrin , which redistributes from the cytosol to membrane to help in CME , is not affected by similar changes in tension ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 10a ) . These experiments indicated that the molecular machinery involved in regulating the CG pathway is modulated by moderate changes in membrane tension . Vinculin serves as a mechanotransducer . For cells to respond to changes in tension , they must ﬁ rst sense and transduce this information . Since focal adhesion - related molecules help trans - duce and respond to force 5 , 44 , 45 we hypothesized that these molecules could transduce a mechanical stimulus to regulate endocytic processes . Membrane tension could be transmitted across integrins 46 and even regulate focal adhesion positioning through vinculin 47 . Indeed , several of these proteins were ‘ hits ’ in a recent RNA interference screen for genes that in ﬂ uence CG endocytosis 48 . The focal adhesion is an intricate macromolecular complex that has multiple functional modules 49 of which vinculin is a critical part of the mechanotransduction machinery 44 , 45 , 49 . Unlike the ‘ hits ’ , Talin or p130CAS , there is only a single func - tional isoform of vinculin in non - muscle cells . Therefore , we used vinculin - null MEFs 50 to test its role in the mechano - responsive behavior of the CG pathway . We noticed that the basal ﬂ uid - phase uptake in vinculin - null MEFs is higher than that of WT MEFs ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) .

Unlike WT MEFs that show ~ 82 % reduction in uptake on stretching ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , vinculin - null MEFs show only a moderate drop of ~ 36 % at the same strain levels ( Fig . 7a ) . Increasing the extent of membrane tension by hypotonic shock showed a concomitant decrease in ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis of WT cells ( Fig . 7b ) . By contrast , vinculin - null MEFs were much more refractory to the same extent of hypotonic shock , registering a reduction in ﬂ uid - phase uptake only at much higher hypotonicity ( Fig . 7b ) . Furthermore , upon strain relaxation , ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis in vinculin - null MEFs did not show an increase ( Fig . 7a ) , unlike that observed for WT MEFs ( Fig . 3a ) or CHO cells ( Fig . 1c ) . However , the membrane of vinculin - null MEFs did respond to changes in membrane tension ( Supplementary Fig . 10c ) .

Thus , vinculin - null cells do not exhibit an endocytic response to changes in tension . Further , when WT cells are de - adhered from the substrate and kept in suspension , they too failed to exhibit an endocytic response to changes in tension created during hypo – iso conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 10e ) . However , similar to spread cells ( Fig . 4b ) , the suspension cells also exhibit characteristics consistent with the passive changes expected from the reduction in membrane tension ( Supplementary Fig . 10f and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . These observations indicate that attachment to the surface via integrins , and concomitant vinculin activation , is important for the control of the endocytic response . Vinculin negatively regulates CG endocytosis . To test if the endocytic effects of vinculin - null cells are speci ﬁ cally due to a lack of vinculin , we expressed full - length vinculin ( Vin WT ) 51 in vinculin - null cells . This caused a decrease in ﬂ uid - phase endo - cytosis ( Fig . 7c and Supplementary Fig . 11a ) and rescued the transient endocytic response on decrease in tension ( Fig . 7c ) . Vinculin is activated by binding to talin localized at integrin - mediated focal complex 51 . Unlike WT - Vinculin addback in the vinculin - null cells ( Fig . 7c ) , vinculin with talin binding mutation ( Vin - A50I ) 51 did not reduce ﬂ uid uptake ( Fig . 7d ) , indicating that talin is required for vinculin to regulate the CG pathway . On the other hand , constitutively active vinculin ( Vin - CA ) and Vin - CA with a talin binding mutation ( Vin - A50I - CA ) 51 reduced ﬂ uid - phase uptake signi ﬁ cantly , but failed to respond to changes in tension ( Fig . 7e ) . This indicates that talin - mediated activation of vinculin is required for the mechano - response of the CG pathway . Vinculin - null cells have a higher basal endocytosis rate ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) and it is possible that they are unable to respond to a decrease in membrane tension and increase in endocytosis . Firstly , we con ﬁ rmed that a GBF1 - sensitive CG pathway is functional in vinculin - null cells . Upon GBF1 inhibition in vinculin - null cells , ﬂ uid - phase uptake decreased to the same levels as cells expressing vinculin , also suggesting that GBF1 operates downstream of vinculin ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) . Next , we observed that BFA - treated vinculin - null cells showed an increase in their endocytic rate which is sensitive to GBF1 inhibition , similar to WT cells ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . This shows that vinculin - null cells have the potential to upregulate the CG pathway and their inability to do so on reducing tension is due to the lack of mechanotransduction . We next tested if GBF1 shows a tension - dependent membrane localization in vinculin - null cells . The level of punctae remained constant and failed to respond to hypotonic shock ( Fig . 7f ) , unlike that observed in WT MEF ( Fig . 6a ) . The density of GBF1 punctae at the plasma membrane was also slightly higher in vinculin - null cells compared to WT cells ( Supplementary Fig . 11c ) . This is consistent with higher ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis in vinculin - null cells compared to control MEF cell line ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) . Finally , we determined the steady - state membrane tension in vinculin - null cells compared to WT cells . Tether forces , as measured using optical tweezers , were higher for vinculin - null cells compared to WT cells ( Fig . 8a ) . The high tether force in cells lacking vinculin was drastically reduced on inhibiting the CG pathway ( Fig . 8a ) , consistent with the role of the CG pathway in a b Hypo Hypo – Iso 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 N o r m a li z ed G B F 1 s po t s / c e ll G F P - G B F 1 T I R F Hypo Iso Iso Fig . 6 Mechanical modulation of CG molecular machinery . a GBF1 – GFP punctae in WT MEF cells by live TIRF microscopy on modulating osmolarity by changing the media from isotonic ( Iso ) to 40 % hypotonic ( Hypo ) and back to isotonic ( Iso ) . b Quanti ﬁ cation of the number of punctae per cell in ( a ) .

Thus , vinculin acts as a negative regulator of CG pathway and is necessary for the transduction of physical stimuli for the biochemical control of the CG pathway . Mechanochemical control of cell membrane tension . To ratio - nalize our experimental results , we propose a simple feedback inhibition model based on a mechanochemical mechanism for the sensing and control of membrane tension . The mechanochemical mechanism involves ( i ) membrane ﬂ ux via CG endocytosis , ( ii ) concentration of membrane - bound vinculin ( in the active open con ﬁ guration ) and ( iii ) concentration of activated membrane - bound GBF1 , which together go to sense and regulate the membrane tension . Membrane tension is determined by the relative balance between CG endocytosis and exocytosis , which in turn depends on the levels of activated GBF1 and tension . The levels of activated GBF1 depend on the concentration of membrane - bound vinculin . Such a negative feedback inhibition model can give rise to a robust control of membrane tension G F P - G B F 1 i n T I R F V i n – / – M E F Iso Iso Hypo Hypo Hypo – Iso 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 N o r m a li z ed G B F 1 s po t s Stretch Control Stretch – relax Vinculin – / – % Hypotonicity WT MEF 0 10 20 30 50 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 N o r m a li z ed f l u i d up t a k e Vinculin – / – N o r m a li z ed f l u i d up t a k e 0 10 20 30 50 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 % Hypotonicity Control Stretch Stretch – relax N o r m a li z ed f l u i d up t a k e 6 % Strain 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 ns * Iso Hypo – Iso Vin – / – Vin - A50I F l u i d up t a k e 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 ns ns Iso Hypo – Iso Vin – / – VinWT F l u i d up t a k e 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 ns * * Iso Hypo - Iso Vin - A50I - CA Vin – / – Vin - CA F l u i d up t a k e 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 ns ns ns * * a b c d e f ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4217 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications ( Fig . 8b ) . The mathematical details of this model are discussed in the supplementary information ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . Discussion Membrane tension has been long proposed to be tightly coupled to vesicular traf ﬁ cking through endo – exocytic pathways . However , the speci ﬁ c traf ﬁ cking mechanisms have remained elusive . Here , we show that a GBF1 - , ARF1 - , CDC42 - and IRSp53 - dependent CG endocytosis rapidly responds to changes in tension , and helps restore any change from a tension set point ( Fig . 8b ) . When membrane tension decreases ( increases ) in cells attached to a surface , there is a correlated increase ( decrease ) in the CG path - way , bringing about a rapid endocytic response to reset the cell ’ s resting membrane tension . Conversely , inhibiting the CG pathway decreases membrane tension while upregulating the pathway increases membrane tension . This negative feedback inhibition is used in many different biological contexts to maintain home - ostasis 52 , and is captured by our simple feedback inhibition model . The separation of time scales between the fast dynamics of the activation of vinculin ( triggered by sensing talin stretch ) , and slower dynamics of the displacement of GBF1 from the membrane and inhibition of CG endocytosis , suggests that vinculin is a sensor Fig . 7 Vinculin - dependent mechanoregulation of CG pathway . a Fluid uptake in vinculin - null cells either during a 6 % stretch or on relaxing this strain ( n = Control ( 281 ) , Stretch ( 229 ) , Stretch – Relax ( 347 ) ) . b Fluid uptake in WT and vinculin - null MEFs in increasing hypotonic medium as indicated ( n = WT MEF : 0 ( 425 ) , 10 ( 391 ) , 20 ( 416 ) , 30 ( 368 ) , 50 ( 346 ) ; Vinculin − / − : 0 ( 355 ) , 10 ( 376 ) , 20 ( 333 ) , 30 ( 342 ) , 50 ( 340 ) ) . c Fluid uptake in vinculin - null cells ( Vin − / − ) or Vin − / − transfected with Vinculin WT ( VinWT ) either in isotonic medium ( Iso ) or in isotonic medium after a hypotonic shock for 1 min ( Hypo – Iso ) ( n = Vin − / − – Iso ( 256 ) , Hypo – Iso ( 272 ) ; VinWT – Iso ( 188 ) , Hypo – Iso ( 146 ) ) . d Fluid uptake in Vin − / − or Vin − / − transfected with vinculin with talin binding mutation ( Vin - A50I ) either in Iso or Hypo – Iso ( n = Vin − / − – Iso ( 251 ) , Hypo – Iso ( 264 ) ; Vin - A50I – Iso ( 219 ) , Hypo _ Iso ( 190 ) ) . e Fluid uptake in Vin − / − , Vin − / − transfected with constitutively active vinculin ( Vin - CA ) or constitutively active vinculin with talin binding mutation ( Vin - A50I - CA ) in Iso or Hypo – Iso ( n = Vin − / − – Iso ( 327 ) , Hypo – Iso ( 334 ) ; Vin - CA – Iso ( 238 ) , Hypo – Iso ( 179 ) ; Vin - A50I - CA – Iso ( 139 ) , Hypo – Iso ( 150 ) ) .

To provide robust feedback control , tension set point γ s should be compared to the instantaneous tension γ out and compensate for the difference . See supplementary information ( Supplementary Note 1 ) for detailed description of the mechanochemical model NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4217 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 of the instantaneous membrane tension . The negative feedback inhibition is predicated on a fast sensing of tension by vinculin and a slower regulation of the endocytic machinery . Akin to the passive response to tension 6 , physical parameters could directly regulate the active endocytic machinery by in ﬂ u - encing the extent of membrane deformation needed to make an endocytic vesicle . However , our results from studying vinculin - null cells suggest otherwise . Vinculin , a key focal adhesion pro - tein , transduces many mechanical inputs at the site of the focal adhesion into information for the cell to process 13 , 45 , 49 . In this context , it appears that vinculin plays a central role in transducing the increase ( or decrease ) in membrane tension to the CG pathway to help inhibit ( or activate ) its endocytic mechanism ( Supplementary Fig . 12a ) . Membrane tension has been shown to regulate tension that is experienced by integrin molecule 53 , and tension also in ﬂ uences focal adhesion positioning 47 . In turn , this focal adhesion tension , transduced via vinculin , regulates GBF1 and thus the CG pathway , further in ﬂ uencing membrane tension . Thus , it is likely that the changes in membrane tension are communicated via changes experienced in forces at attachment sites . Consistent with this hypothesis , cells in suspension that lack attachment sites do not modulate their CG pathway , similar to cells that lack vinculin . Vinculin recruits phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) in a force - dependent manner helping in tumor progression 54 and mechanical cues transmitted through focal adhesions have been implicated in cancer progression 5 . PI3K products help recruit GBF1 , an ARF1 GEF , to the plasma membrane and this is necessary for CG endocytosis 55 , indicating a possible mechanism for vinculin - dependent regulation of the CG pathway . Regardless of the details , mechanotransduction mediated by vinculin is important for translating mechanical information into a bio - chemical read - out to in ﬂ uence the CG endocytic rate . Multiple endocytic pathways operate in a cell with a possible functional specialization for each . Caveolae passively buffer increases in tension 7 , while CME concentrates speci ﬁ c ligands and mediates robust endocytosis despite the increase in tension 56 . Membrane tension is also involved in transition of clathrin coats from ﬂ at to curved 57 , while actin machinery helps provide forces to internalize clathrin coat under high tension 56 , 58 , 59 . De - adhered cells exhibit an increased caveolin - mediated inter - nalization that persists over hours in suspension , and is crucial for anchorage - dependent growth and anoikis 29 . Unlike the caveolar pathway , we ﬁ nd that the CG pathway showed an upregulation of endocytosis only during de - adhering that did not persist in suspension . The CG pathway is also more temperature - sensitive than CME . In cells such as HeLa that lack a typical dynamin - independent CG pathway 24 , 26 , they appear to have an AP2 - , GRAF1 - and dynamin - dependent endocytic machinery 24 . These cells also do not upregulate endocytosis in response to moderate osmotic shock but do so in response to extreme osmolarity changes applied for longer time points ( such as Hypo6X - Iso ) . Considering that osmotic changes are also likely to trigger different cellular responses 60 , the endocytic response in these contexts while dependent on GRAF1 39 requires further characterization . Inhibition of GRAF1 in HeLa causes a blebbing response 39 ( possibly due to a complete shutdown of endocytosis 8 ) and this helps in cancer cell migration 39 . Together , these results indicate that different endocytic pathways have distinct regimes of operation and serve important functions in eukaryotic cells . In this study we ﬁ nd that the composition - sensitive high - capacity CG pathway 25 , 32 is modulated by mechanochemical inputs . This could increase the potential of membrane tension to regulate other cellular processes , such as those that may need a supply of membrane at long and short time scales , e . g . migration and phagocytosis . Thus , the CG pathway responds to and coor - dinates a variety of cellular inputs , including membrane tension , and is likely to function in multiple physiological contexts .

To remove surface ﬂ uorescence , cells were treated with PI - PLC ( 50 μ g / ml , 1 h ; GPI - APs ) or with ascorbate buffer ( 160mM sodium ascorbate , 40 mM ascorbic acid , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , pH 4 . 5 ; Tf ) at 4 °C , surface transferrin receptor labeled using anti - hTfR ( OKT9 ) monoclonal antibody ( used at 1 : 100 ) and subsequently ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min . To study endocytosis on de - adhering , cells were detached using TrypLE containing ﬂ uorescent - dextran at 1 mg / ml concentration for 3min and the detached cells were pipetted into an ice - cold vial containing M1 buffer to stop the endocytosis . Cells were then re - plated back on coverslip bottom dish maintained at 4°C , ﬁ xed , washed and imaged . To look at endocytosis in suspension , the cells soon after detaching were pipetted into a vial containing ﬂ uorescent - dextran kept at 37 °C . The volume was adjusted to have a ﬁ nal concentration of 1mg / ml of the TMR - Dex and after 3 min the endocytosis was stopped by shifting vial to ice . The cells are spun down at 4°C and then re - plated on coverslip bottom dish coated with ConA , maintained at 4 °C , ﬁ xed , washed and imaged . To understand recycling of cargo on de - adhering , cells were pulsed with F - Dex for 3min , quickly washed with M1 buffer at room temperature and then detached with TrypLE at 37 °C for 5min , pipetted into a vial containing ice - cold M1 buffer and kept on ice . Cells were then re - plated back on coverslip bottom dish coated with ConA maintained at 4°C , ﬁ xed , washed and imaged . Endocytosis of ﬂ uid and transferrin at different temperatures were done by pre - equilibrating the cells to the respective temperatures and then pulsing TMR - Dex ( ﬂ uid ) or Tf - A647 ( transferrin ) for 5 min at these temperatures . AP2 shRNA or its control pSUPER vector 37 was transfected into FR - AGS or HeLa cells for 4 days to knock down AP2 - μ 2 and inhibit CME as reported earlier 37 and was followed by endocytosis experiment as described above . Different small - molecule inhibitors were incubated with cells for 30 min in serum free media in their respective ﬁ nal concentrations and then medium was removed and pulsed with F - Dex at 1mg / ml in serum free media containing the inhibitors since the inhibitor activity is reversible . Endocytosis was stopped by washing with ice - cold M1 buffer , ﬁ xed and imaged . Preparation of PDMS membrane ring . Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit comes in two parts which are added in 10 to 1 mix ratio between the polydimethylsiloxane base and the curing agent . This is thoroughly mixed and degassing is done either using a vacuum desiccator or by centrifugation . To prepare polydimethylsiloxan ( PDMS ) sheets , 7ml of this mixture was added to the middle of a circular 6inch plate which is spun at 500 R . P . M for 1min on a spin coater . This was cured at 65° C overnight and then carefully peeled off either after treatment with oxygen plasma cleaner for 40 s or without treatment . This PDMS sheet is spread evenly and tightly placed between rings of the stretcher ( Fig . 1b ) . The cells were plated in the middle of the PDMS sheet surrounded with water - soaked tissue paper to retain humidity and prevent drying up of medium . These rings were placed in the stretcher and ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4217 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06738 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications stretched by varying the level of vacuum as needed according to the calibration for the experiments . Stretch and osmolarity experiments . For the stretch – relax experiments , cells plated on PDMS membrane were loaded on the cell stretcher system ( Fig . 1b ) within a temperature - controlled chamber at 37 °C . Vacuum was applied beneath the ring containing the PDMS sheet , deforming the membrane and stretching the cells plated on the PDMS . The setup was calibrated to stretch cells equi - biaxially to cause 6 % strain for 90 s . Cells were pulsed for 90 s either during stretch or on releasing the strain . Medium containing F - Dex was kept at 37°C in a water bath , and used for the endocytic pulse for the indicated time during or after stretch ( see endocytic protocol above ) . Control cells were treated in the same way except for application of stretch . For the osmolarity experiments , cells were treated with 50 % hypotonic medium ( unless otherwise mentioned ) made with deionized water at 37°C for the indicated time points and then pulsed with TMR - Dex either in hypotonic or isotonic medium as needed . The shock was applied for 60s and pulse done for 60s unless otherwise mentioned . For the extreme hypotonic experiment , 6× diluted medium was used for 10min followed by isotonic pulse for 10min to replicate the earlier protocol 39 . Endocytosis was stopped with ice - cold M1 buffer , washed , ﬁ xed and imaged . Optical tweezer measurements . Tether forces were measured using a custom built optical tweezer using IR laser ( continuous wave , 1064 nm , TEM _ 00 , 1 W ) along with 100× , 1 . 3NA oil objective and motorized stage on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope . Uncoated polystyrene beads added to the imaging chamber were allowed to settle and then held in the optical trap while simultaneously imaging through bright ﬁ eld on a coolsnap HQ CCD camera . Uncoated polystyrene beads bind to the membrane due to non - speci ﬁ c interactions . Membrane tethers are formed by attaching the beads to the cell membrane for a few seconds and by moving the bead away from the cell using the piezo stage . Uncoated polystyrene beads bind to the membrane due to non - speci ﬁ c interactions and a thin membrane tether is formed from the cell to the bead ( Fig . 5a ) . The tether is held at a constant length and the ﬂ uctua - tion in the trapped bead is detected by using a quadrant photodiode which in turn is acquired and saved using a LabVIEW program through a Data Acquisition Card ( USB - 6009 NI ) . The trap stiffness is calibrated using the power spectrum method . The displacement of the bead from the center along with the trap stiffness is used to calculate the tether forces live using a custom written LabVIEW code . CTxB - HRP uptake and DAB reaction and Electron Microscopy . WT and Cav − / − MEFs were de - adhered at room temperature followed by internalization of 4µg / ml CTxB - HRP ( Invitrogen ) at 37 °C for 5min , washed two times with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) followed by incubation on ice for 10min with 1 mg / ml 3 , 3 ′ - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ; Sigma Aldrich ) with 50 µM ascorbic acid . This is followed by a 10 - min treatment with DAB , ascorbic acid and 0 . 012 % H 2 O 2 and then washed twice with ice - cold PBS . Cells were ﬁ xed using 2 . 5 % Glutar - aldehyde ( ProSciTech ) at room temperature for 1 h followed by PBS wash for two times and then washed with 0 . 1M Na cacodylate and left in the same for overnight at 4 °C . Cells were contrasted with 1 % osmium tetroxide and 4 % uranyl acetate . Cells were dehydrated in successive washes of 70 % , 90 % and 100 % ethanol before embedding using 100 % LX - 112 resin at 60 °C overnight . Sections were viewed under a transmission electron microscope ( JEOL 1011 ; JEOL Ltd . Tokyo , Japan ) , and electron micrographs were captured with a digital camera ( Morada ; Olympus ) using AnalySIS software ( Olympus ) . Imaging and analysis and statistics . The quanti ﬁ cation of endocytic uptake for a population is done by imaging on 20× , 0 . 75 NA on a Nikon TE300 wide - ﬁ eld inverted microscope . For the stretch experiments , an upright microscope ( Nikon eclipse Ni – U ) was used with a water immersion objective ( 60× , 1 . 0NA ) . For endosome size calculation , spinning disk confocal microscope ( 100× , 1 . 4NA ) was used with ANDOR iQ software followed by analysis using 3D object counter plugin in Fiji 61 . The images were analyzed using MetaMorph ® or Micro - Manager software and were processed for presentation using Adobe Illustrator . All images displayed are equally scaled for intensity unless otherwise mentioned . The integrated intensities , spread area and thus average uptake per cell were determined by drawing regions around each cell using the region measurement option in Fiji 61 . For plotting endocytic uptake , all values are normalized to the mean value of the control and plotted as a box plot using Origin software ( Ori - ginLab , Northampton , MA ) . Box plot shows uptake per cell ( each data point ) and it also shows median ( middle line ) , standard deviation ( whiskers ) , 25th percentile ( lower line of box ) and 75th percentile ( upper line of box ) value . The box plot contains points pooled from two separate experiments with technical duplicates in each and normalized to their respective controls . The total number of cells in each condition ( pooled from all experiments ) is mentioned in the legends . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was tested using the Mann – Whitney test and p values used to deter - mine signi ﬁ cance are reported in the legends . The scale bar is 10 μ m , unless otherwise mentioned .
