A nonclathrin endocytic ( NCE ) pathway of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is activated at high ligand concentrations and targets receptors to degradation , attenuating signaling . Here we performed an unbiased molecular characterization of EGFR - NCE . We identified NCE - specific regulators , including the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) – resident protein reticulon 3 ( RTN3 ) and a specific cargo , CD147 . RTN3 was critical for EGFR / CD147 - NCE , promoting the creation of plasma membrane ( PM ) – ER contact sites that were required for the formation and / or maturation of NCE invaginations . Ca 2 + release at these sites , triggered by inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) – dependent activation of ER Ca 2 + channels , was needed for the completion of EGFR internalization . Thus , we identified a mechanism of EGFR endocytosis that relies on ER - PM contact sites and local Ca 2 + signaling . A lthough clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) represents the best - characterized internal - ization route into cells ( 1 ) , several nonclath - rin endocytic ( NCE ) pathways exist that specify diversified functions and / or the fates of individual cargoes ( 2 ) . Ligand - induced internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) occurs through both CME and NCE , depending on growth con - ditions and cellular context ( 3 – 6 ) . At a low epi - dermal growth factor ( EGF ) dose ( 1 ng / ml ) , EGFRs are primarily internalized by CME and recycled back to the plasma membrane ( PM ) , with ~ 30 % of receptors targeted to degradation ( 7 ) . At high phys - iological EGF concentrations ( 20 to 100 ng / ml ) , NCE gets activated in parallel to CME . EGFRs entering via NCE ( ~ 40 % ) are predominantly traf - ficked to the lysosome for degradation , leading to signal extinction ( 7 , 8 ) . Thus , NCE might serve as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling in re - sponse to excessive stimuli . EGFR - NCE is apparently distinct from other endocytic pathways ( table S1 ) . It is cholesterol - and dynamin - dependent , but caveolin - independent , and requires EGFR ubiquitination and proteins harboring ubiquitin - binding domains ( 4 , 8 ) . How - ever , a detailed understanding of its molecular workings is lacking . Such knowledge would help in our understanding of how the cell has devel - oped different mechanisms of endocytosis to con - trol the balance between positive and negative regulation of receptor signaling . Moreover , given the established role of EGFR in oncogenesis ( 9 ) , it might provide insights into possible mechanisms of tumorigenesis , because NCE displays the char - acteristics of a tumor suppressor mechanism . Here , we provide a comprehensive molecular por - trait of the pathway and details of the mechanism underlying NCE . Results Molecular characterization of EGFR - NCE To identify proteins involved in EGFR - NCE , we performed analysis by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) of purified EGFR - containing NCE vesicles ( 10 ) . Vesicles were purified under conditions of inducible clathrin gene silencing or knockdown ( KD ) ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1 ) . Although this approach only yielded a partially purified vesicle fraction , the high dis - criminatory power of SILAC allowed us to identify EGFR - NCE candidates by comparing vesicles from EGF - stimulated clathrin KD cells versus unstimu - lated cells , which represented the “ background ” ( Fig . 1B ) . Three experiments yielded overlapping pro - teomes ( ~ 60 % ) ( Fig . 1C and table S3 , spread - sheet 1 ) , with a bimodal distribution of SILAC ratios ( Fig . 1D and table S3 , spreadsheet 2 ) . The major peak , centered on a high - to - low ( H / L ) ratio of ~ 1 ( log 2 ratio of ~ 0 ) , represents proteins equal - ly present in the two samples ( presumably con - taminants ) ; the minor peak , centered on H / L ratio ~ 2 . 3 ( log 2 ratio ~ 1 . 2 ) , should be enriched in EGFR - NCE components . To select candidates for validation , we applied high - confidence filters : proteins present in the top 20 % , ranked by H / L ratios , in three out of three replicates and robust - ly quantified [ ratio count ( RC ) > 2 ] . This selection process yielded 151 proteins ( Fig . 1D and table S3 , spreadsheet 3 ) , of which 101 were tested in validation experiments ( table S3 , spreadsheets 3 and 4 ) . Validation of SILAC candidates To validate candidates , we silenced their expres - sion in inducible clathrin KD cells and analyzed EGFR internalization following stimulation with high - dose EGF [ fig . S2A ( 1 ) ] . We scored an effect on EGFR - NCE for 43 candidates ( table S4 , spread - sheets 1 and 2 ) . These candidates were then screened for their effects on ( i ) EGFR - NCE upon transient clathrin KD ( to obtain replicates and exclude clonal effects ) ; ( ii ) EGFR - CME at low EGF doses ; ( iii ) transferrin receptor ( TfR ) – CME ; and ( iv ) surface EGFR number , because this might affect the internalization constants [ fig . S2A ( 2 ) , and table S4 , spreadsheets 3 to 9 ] . After decon - volution analysis [ fig . S2A ( 3 ) ] , we derived a list of nine EGFR - NCE regulators , which included signal - transduction , RNA - binding , and endo - plasmic reticulum ( ER ) – mitochondrial proteins ( Fig . 2A ) , not previously implicated in internal - ization pathways ( table S1 and fig . S2 , D to G ) . RTN3 is a critical regulator of EGFR - NCE Of the nine candidate EGFR - NCE regulators , the ER tubulation factor reticulon 3 ( RTN3 ) ( 11 ) showed one of the strongest phenotypes ( Fig . 2A ) . KD of RTN3 resulted in ~ 50 % reduction in EGF internalization at a high dose ( Fig . 2B ) , compat - ible with the proportion of EGFRs entering via NCE ( 4 ) . The double RTN3 and clathrin KD re - duced EGF internalization almost to the levels observed under dynamin KD ( Fig . 2 , B and C , and fig . S2B ) , demonstrating its requirement for EGFR - NCE . Conversely , RTN3 KD had a minor impact on EGFR internalization at low EGF doses and no effect on transferrin ( Tf ) internalization ( Fig . 2 , B and D ) . Another ER - shaping factor , REEP5 , also had a substantial effect on NCE ( Fig . 2A ) . RTN3 and REEP5 form a complex with another reticulon , RTN4 , and this complex is implicated in cortical ER tubulation ( 11 , 12 ) . However , RTN4 KD did not affect EGFR internalization ( Fig . 2B and fig . S2C ) , which indicates a specific function of RTN3 and REEP5 in NCE . NCE preferentially targets EGFRs to degrada - tion ( 7 ) . Accordingly , RTN3 KD delayed EGFR and EGF degradation ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) , reduced EGFR trafficking toward multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) ( fig . S3A ) , and increased EGF - induced signaling ( Fig . 2G ) .

F . ) RTN3 is required for the maturation of NCE intermediates at the PM We characterized EGFR - NCE by electron micros - copy ( EM ) . In control cells , gold - labeled EGFR was detectable in clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and in tubular invaginations [ ( TIs ) ; diameter ≈ 80 nm ] ( Fig . 3 , A and B , and fig . S3B ) . TIs persisted in clathrin KD cells ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , which suggests that they might represent the structures mediating EGFR - NCE . TIs are morphologically reminiscent of clathrin - independent carriers ( 13 , 14 ) , although the two pathways show distinct functional re - quirements ( table S1 ) ( 15 ) . In RTN3 KD cells , TIs were significantly re - duced in number ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , whereas no effect was observed on CCPs ( Fig . 3B ) , which indi - cates that TIs are NCE intermediates whose for - mation and maturation are RTN3 - dependent . Note that dynamin KD did not reduce TI number ( Fig . 3B ) ; rather , it increased the ratio of long ( > 300 nm ) versus short TIs ( ~ 150 to 300 nm ) ( Fig . 3C ) . A similar phenotype was observed for CCPs , with a shift toward longer CCPs ( > 200 nm ) ( Fig . 3C ) , as previously reported ( 16 ) . These data argue that dynamin is involved in the fission of TIs ( and CCPs ) , whereas RTN3 could act up - stream , at the level of TI maturation . Indeed , the RTN3 KD phenotype appeared epistatic to the dy - namin one , because the double KD RTN3 and dynamin closely resembled the single RTN3 KD phenotype ( Fig . 3B ) . We then followed gold - EGFR internalization by discriminating PM - connected from internal - ized structures with ruthenium red ( RuR ) ( fig . S3 , C and D ) . In control cells , EGFR present in RuR - positive structures ( CCPs and TIs ) decreased over time , with a parallel increase of internalized re - ceptors ( Fig . 3 , D and E , and fig . S3D ) . In clathrin KD and RTN3 KD cells , gold - EGFR in intracellular structures significantly decreased ( ~ 50 % ) , accom - panied by an increase in RuR - positive structures ( Fig . 3 , D and E , and fig . S3D ) , consistent with the inhibition of CME and NCE , respectively . In double clathrin and RTN3 KD cells , internaliza - tion was almost completely blocked ( > 80 % ) , in agreement with 125 I - labeled EGF internalization assays ( Fig . 3F ) . RTN3 localizes in close proximity to active EGFR By immunofluorescence ( IF ) , we confirmed that RTN3 is an ER - resident protein ( fig . S3 , E to G ) , located in the peripheral ER and colocalized with cortical ER markers involved in ER - PM contact sites , namely , E - Syt1 and STIM1 [ fig . S3F and ( 17 , 18 ) ] . This result was verified by immuno - EM , which showed that RTN3 was exclusively asso - ciated with ER , and no PM signals , above back - ground , could be evidenced ( fig . S3H ) . By proximity ligation assays , RTN3 and acti - vated EGFR were found in close proximity ( with - in ~ 30 nm ) upon EGF stimulation ( fig . S4A ) . To better define the RTN3 and EGFR association , we used superresolution microscopy and Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . With the first approach , weobserved , with high - EGF use , increased coclustering of EGFR and RTN3 [ amplitude of the correlation ( C 0 ) ] and an increase of cluster size ( R c ) at the cell periphery versus cells stimulated with low EGF dose or unstimulated ( Fig . 4A ) . By FRET , a higher signal between RTN3 and EGFR was registered with high EGF dose compared with basal conditions ( Fig . 4B ) . The signal was specific , because no signal was detectable for the pair TfR - RTN3 ( fig . S4B ) . The EGFR - RTN3 FRET signal is compatible with the scenario that pe - ripheral ER comes into close proximity with active EGFR on EGF stimulation .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE ER proteins ( RTN4 , STIM1 , and E - Syt1 ) gave a positive FRET signal within 5 min of EGF stim - ulation ( Fig . 4B and fig . S4C ) , whereas proteins not enriched in peripheral ER did not ( Fig . 4B and fig . S4C ) . When we restricted FRET analysis to the PM regions where EGFR is active ( by ap - plying a PM EGF - based mask , excluding endo - somes ) and followed the FRET signal kinetically in the initial phases of EGF stimulation ( first 3 min ) , RTN3 was the sole marker that gave a significant FRET signal ( Fig . 4C ) . In agreement , the KD of E - Syt and STIM proteins — as in the case of RTN4 — did not affect EGFR endocytosis ( Fig . 2B and fig . S4D ) . RTN3 is required for ER - PM contact sites where EGFR - NCE occurs The above results are compatible with the for - mation of RTN3 - dependent EGF - induced con - tact sites between peripheral ER and NCE - TIs . We transfected cells with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) – labeled KDEL peptide sequence ( 17 , 19 ) to visualize the ER and detected areas of ER - PM proximity , in regions that either contained or did not contain the EGFR ( fig . S5A ) . Initially , we ex - plored the effect of RTN3 KD on general ER morphology , in parallel with RTN4 KD , which was previously shown to affect ER architecture by skewing ER peripheral tubules toward cisternae ( 20 ) . We confirmed the RTN4 KD phenotype in our cell system by three - dimensional ( 3D ) ER re - construction , as evidenced by an increase in long ER profiles ( > 1000 nm ) with a concomitant de - crease in shorter profiles ( fig . S5B ) . Conversely , in RTN3 KD cells , we did not observe major re - arrangements in the distribution of ER profiles , and this confirms previously reported results obtained in RTN3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( fig . S5B ) ( 21 ) . However , automated ER segmentation analy - sis on high - resolution images revealed that both RTN3 and RTN4 KD reduced the number of small tubular ER profiles , whereas only RTN4 KD in - creased large ER sheets ( fig . S5C ) . EGF stimula - tion caused an increase in tubular ER profiles within 20 nm of the PM , consistent with the for - mation of EGF - induced ER - PM contact sites . Al - though RTN3 and RTN4 KD had a similar impact on the tubulation of peripheral bulk ER ( fig . S5C ) , onlyRTN3KDreducedthenumberofEGF - induced ER - PM contact sites ( Fig . 4D ) . Finally , we investigated the existence of spe - cific RTN3 - dependent contacts between ER and EGFR - NCE structures by performing serial sec - tions and quantification of contacts between the ER ( HRP - KDEL ) and gold - EGFR – positive PM in - vaginations ( NCE - TIs or CCPs ) . Serial sectioning allowed us to detect contact sites even when gold - labeled EGFR and ER were not visible in the same section ( Fig . 4E and fig . S5D ) . We consi - dered as “ contacts ” those instances in which ER proximity ( ≤ 20 nm ) to gold - EGFR – positive PM invaginations was present in at least one out of three sections ( Fig . 4E ) . About 20 % of the EGFR - containing PM - TIs were in contact with tubular ER , whereas there were no contacts between ER and CCPs .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE were not in contact with ER ( Fig . 4E and fig . S5D for distance - dependent analysis ) . Serial sec - tioning is prone to underestimate the phenom - enon , because we inevitably lose some of the contacts between two consecutive sections ( thick - ness of ~ 60 nm ) . Indeed , by performing tomo - grams ( z - axis resolution of ~ 3 to 6 nm ) of 11 randomly selected CD147 - positive TIs , we found that 8 out of the 11 TIs were in contact with an ER tubule ( ~ 70 % ) ( see fig . S6 , for extracts from four representative tomograms , and movie S1 ) . CD147 , a cargo internalizing through NCE In the initial candidate list , there were many PM - resident proteins whose ablation did not alter EGFR - NCE . These proteins might represent cargoes of this pathway . As proof of principle of this concept , we focused on cluster of dif - ferentiation 147 ( CD147 ) , also known as basigin ( BSG ) . CD147 colocalized with internalized EGF in clathrin KD cells ( fig . S7A ) , which suggests that it cotraffics with the EGFR through NCE . Thus , we followed CD147 endocytosis with an antibody that recognizes its extracellular domain without interfering with endocytosis ( 22 ) . Upon EGF stim - ulation , CD147 was internalized and colocalized with EGF via a clathrin - independent process that was sensitive to RTN3 KD ( Fig . 5 , A and B , and fig . S7B for controls ) . Note that CD147 - EGFR internalization in RTN3 KD cells was restored by the reintroduction of RTN3A , which is the most - expressed RTN3 isoform in HeLa cells ( Fig . 5C and fig . S8 , A to C ) . Thus , upon EGF stimulation , CD147 enters the cell almost exclusively through NCE and can be used as a specific marker of this pathway . We exploited CD147 internalization as an indepen - dent tool for the validation of the functional role of candidate NCE regulators . Silencing of the nine regulators affected CD147 internaliza - tion upon EGF stimulation , corroborating their role in NCE and providing a cross - validation of both functional regulators and cargo ( fig . S9A ) . We then used CD147 for EM analysis . By dou - ble PM RuR - CD147 ( immunogold ) staining , we found that after 5 min of EGF stimulation , CD147 was either at the PM or in TIs indistinguishable from those observed for the EGFR - NCE ( Fig . 5D and fig . S9B ) , but not in CCPs . RTN3 KD re - duced the formation of CD147 - positive TIs ( Fig . 5D ) , which indicates that TIs are indeed endo - cytic intermediates of CD147 . Quantification of gold particles in PM - connected versus internal - ized structures revealed that ~ 75 % of CD147 was at the PM or in PM - connected TIs , with ~ 25 % of gold particles internalized at 5 min ( fig . S9C ) . Ab - lation of RTN3 almost completely blocked CD147 at the PM at all time points analyzed , whereas clathrin KD had no effect ( fig . S9C ) . A time - resolved EM analysis showed a progressive re - duction of CD147 at the PM , concomitant with its recruitment to TIs , followed by its accumula - tion in early endosomes ( EEs ) and , later , in multi - vesicular bodies ( MVBs ) ( Fig . 5E ) , arguing for CD147 endocytic progression . RTN3 KD strongly affected CD147 accumulation in the different compartments , while leaving unaltered its PM localization ( Fig . 5E ) . Finally , we analyzed the proximity between CD147 - containing NCE structures and the ER . We observed a significant increase in ER - PM contacts upon 2 and 5 min of EGF stimulation at CD147 - internalizing sites ( Fig . 5F and fig . S9D ) , as also shown by 3D reconstruction of a CD147 - positive TI ( Fig . 5G , fig . S9E , and movie S1 ) . This phenotype was abolished by RTN3 KD ( Fig . 5F ) but not by RTN4 KD ( fig . S9F ) , which had no effect on CD147 internalization ( fig . S9G ) .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE activated the EGFR / CD147 - NCE pathway at high EGF doses in a RTN3 - dependent manner ( table S2 ) . ER contact sites are involved in local Ca 2 + release required for NCE progression ER contact sites have a fundamental role in localized Ca 2 + release ( 23 ) , which might be rele - vant to EGFR - NCE . To investigate this , we ex - ploited the Ca 2 + sensor aequorin , either in a cytoplasmic version ( cyto - Aeq ) or targeted to the inner leaflet of the PM ( PM - Aeq ) ( fig . S10A ) ; both forms display the same affinity for Ca 2 + ( 24 ) . We found that ( i ) PM - Aeq detected a peak of Ca 2 + release induced by high , but not low , EGF doses ( Fig . 6A and fig . S10B ) ; ( ii ) the Ca 2 + peak was higher when detected with PM - Aeq versus cyto - Aeq ( Fig . 6A ) , which suggests that it mainly oc - curs in proximity to the PM ; ( iii ) the calcium ( Ca 2 + ) flux did not come from the extracellular space , which was shown by using the Ca 2 + - chelator EGTA , which did not affect peak intensity ( fig . S10C ) ; and ( iv ) RTN3 , but not RTN4 , KD strong - ly impaired the EGF - induced Ca 2 + response ( Fig . 6B and fig . S10D ) . These results are compatible with the pos - sibility that Ca 2 + is released at the PM from the ER , through the formation of EGF - induced RTN3 - dependent contact sites . This might occur through the activation of the inositol triphosphate ( IP 3 ) receptor ( IP3R ) , which is the main pathway pro - moting Ca 2 + release from the ER in HeLa cells ( 25 ) . Indeed , IP3R inhibition by xestospongin C strongly affected EGF - induced Ca 2 + flux at the PM , comparable to RTN3 KD ( Fig . 6C ) , without impairing ER - PM contact site formation at areas of NCE , which indicates that Ca 2 + release is down - stream of RTN3 - dependent contact site formation ( Fig . 6D ) . IP3R inhibition did not affect NCE - TI formation ( Fig . 6E ) , but it prevented progression of NCE internalization ( Fig . 6 , F and G , and fig . S10E ) by blocking the fission of TIs ( xestospongin C treatment phenocopies dynamin KD , causing TI elongation ) ( Figs . 6H and 3C ) , whereas it has limited impact on CME of EGFR and TfR ( fig . S10 , E and F ) . Discussion We report here the molecular characterization of EGFR - NCE . We found that proteins previ - ously not suspected to participate in endocytosis are required , among which is the ER - resident protein RTN3 . We show that at least another cargo , CD147 , is trafficked through the same route . The pathway relies on the establishment of specific RTN3 - dependent ER - PM contact sites . A relevant question concerns the mechanistic role of RTN3 in EGFR - NCE . One possibility is that RTN3 might act as a tethering factor be - tween the ER and PM , in regions where EGFR signaling occurs . In favor of this , we showed close proximity between RTN3 and activated EGFR , as well as specific FRET between the RTN3 - EGFR pair at the PM .

The strongest evidence in this direction is that RTN3 is required for the formation of cortical ER tubules induced by EGF . If this were the case , our data suggest that there must be specificity embedded in the system , because RTN4 KD did not phenocopy the RTN3 KD . In such a scenario , EGFR - emanating signals — whose nature remains to be determined — might exist that induce ER tubulation at specific sites and by dedicated factors . RTN3 - dependent ER - PM contacts are critical for TI formation . In this context , ER - PM con - tact sites may serve as an anchor to provide the pulling force required for TI elongation . In ad - dition , these contacts might be involved in one of the emerging functions of ER - biomembrane contacts , which include phosphoinositide and Ca 2 + signaling , lipid or protein translocation , or in trans regulation of protein function ( 23 ) . We characterized one such function by estab - lishing that RTN3 - mediated ER contacts are involved in EGF - induced local Ca 2 + release from the ER ( IP3R - mediated ) to the PM , which oc - curs only at high EGF dose and is in turn re - quired to finalize the last step of EGFR - NCE , i . e . , the fission of TIs . Thus , there is stepwise requirement of RTN3 - dependent contact sites in EGFR - NCE ( Fig . 6I ) : ( i ) TI formation and / or maturation ; ( ii ) Ca 2 + release at the ER - PM inter - face , which is in turn required for ( iii ) the fission of TIs and the completion of the internalization step . Our data provide evidence for a positive - feedback loop between EGFR - NCE and Ca 2 + signaling : NCE regulates local Ca 2 + release at ER - PM contact sites , and , in turn , Ca 2 + flux is required to finalize EGFR - NCE . It is noteworthy that ER - endosome contact sites have been shown to regulate EGFR signaling and trafficking also Caldieri et al . , Science 356 , 617 – 624 ( 2017 ) 12 May 2017 6 of 8 Fig . 5 .

In conclusion , we have uncovered a modality of internalization that probably integrates numer - ous cellular functions toward its execution . NCE has a major role in the regulation of EGFR fate by determining its long - term attenuation . Possible alterations of NCE players can be envisioned to occur in pathological conditions involving aber - rant EGFR signaling — first and foremost , cancer . REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . T .
