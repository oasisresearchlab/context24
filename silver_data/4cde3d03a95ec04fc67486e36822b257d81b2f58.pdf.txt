Open Access BMC Biology Folylpolyglutamate synthetase mRNA G - quadruplexes regulate its cell protrusion localization and enhance a cancer cell invasive phenotype upon folate repletion Michal Stark 1 , May Levin 1 , 2 , Igor Ulitsky 3 and Yehuda G . Assaraf 1 * Abstract Background Folates are crucial for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and amino acids , essential for cell proliferation and development . Folate deficiency induces DNA damage , developmental defects , and tumorigenicity . The obliga - tory enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( FPGS ) mediates intracellular folate retention via cytosolic and mitochon - drial folate polyglutamylation . Our previous paper demonstrated the association of the cytosolic FPGS ( cFPGS ) with the cytoskeleton and various cell protrusion proteins . Based on these recent findings , the aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of cFPGS at cell protrusions . Results Here we uncovered a central role for two G - quadruplex ( GQ ) motifs in the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS mediating the localization of cFPGS mRNA and protein at cell protrusions . Using the MBSV6 - loop reporter system and fluorescence microscopy , we demonstrate that following folate deprivation , cFPGS mRNA is retained in the endoplasmic reticu - lum , whereas upon 15 min of folate repletion , this mRNA is rapidly translocated to cell protrusions in a 3 ′ UTR - and actin - dependent manner . The actin dependency of this folate - induced mRNA translocation is shown by treatment with Latrunculin B and inhibitors of the Ras homolog family member A ( RhoA ) pathway . Upon folate repletion , the FPGS 3 ′ UTR GQs induce an amoeboid / mesenchymal hybrid cell phenotype during migration and invasion through a collagen gel matrix . Targeted disruption of the 3 ′ UTR GQ motifs by introducing point mutations or masking them by antisense oligonucleotides abrogated cell protrusion targeting of cFPGS mRNA . Conclusions Collectively , the GQ motifs within the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS regulate its transcript and protein localization at cell protrusions in response to a folate cue , inducing cancer cell invasive phenotype . These novel findings suggest that the 3 ′ UTR GQ motifs of FPGS constitute an attractive druggable target aimed at inhibition of cancer invasion and metastasis .

BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 ( GTPases ) , primarily Ras homolog family member A ( RhoA ) , Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , and cell division control protein 42 homolog ( CDC42 ) [ 5 – 7 ] . These GTPases undergo carboxymeth - ylation which is crucial for cell migration [ 8 , 9 ] , affecting protein activation [ 9 , 10 ] , protein half - life [ 11 ] , and sub - cellular protein localization [ 10 , 12 ] . Protein methylation requires S - adenosylmethionine ( SAM , AdoMet ) as the methyl donor [ 13 ] ; this one car - bon methyl unit originates from 5 - methyl - tetrahydro - folate ( 5 - CH 3 - THF ) [ 14 , 15 ] , which is the dominant circulating THF cofactor [ 16 ] . THF cofactors serve as one - carbon donors in a multitude of key biosynthetic processes such as the de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides and amino acids [ 14 ] , one of which is L - methionine that is further converted into SAM . Most eukaryotic cells are auxotrophic for folates [ 17 ] ; thus , they must obtain folates from their diet through specified influx transport systems [ 18 ] . However , since folates can be rapidly exported out of cells , their intra - cellular retention absolutely relies on the unique enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( FPGS ) which is essen - tial for their cellular homeostasis [ 19 ] . FPGS catalyzes the successive addition of glutamate residues to the ɣ - carboxyl group of folates , resulting in their polygluta - mylation [ 20 ] and intracellular accumulation up to three orders of magnitude higher than in the blood [ 21 , 22 ] . Hence , FPGS is vital for the proliferation of normal and malignant cells . The FPGS gene is translated into two isoforms , differ - ing by an N - terminal leader sequence which directs the enzyme to mitochondria [ 23 , 24 ] , where FPGS medi - ates the retention of necessary folates for glycine bio - synthesis [ 24 ] . The shorter isoform , termed cytosolic FPGS ( cFPGS ) , was considered as a soluble protein , piv - otal for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis [ 25 ] . We have recently shown that cFPGS is associated with the cellular cytoskeletal network and intracellular membranes , allowing the regulated transport of cFPGS to locations of folate metabolism , including the sites of folate uptake at the plasma membrane , the nucleus , the outer mitochondrial membrane , and the ER [ 26 ] . While our previous study demonstrated microtubule - depend - ent transport of the cFPGS protein , we herein show the actin - dependent transport of the cFPGS mRNA to cell protrusions . This protrusion - localization of the cFPGS mRNA requires the presence of its 3 ′ UTR , and in par - ticular two G - quadruplex ( GQ ) motifs found therein . In the latter respect , GQs are composed of 4 runs of three ( GGG 4 ) or four ( GGGG 4 ) adjacent guanines ( G - tracts ) which spontaneously self - organize into four - stranded DNA / RNA structures [ 27 , 28 ] . Bioinformatic analyses suggested that 300 , 000 GQ motifs are present in the human genome [ 29 ] . Importantly , it has been shown that these GQ motifs are not randomly dispersed throughout the genome , but are rather densely distrib - uted in many key regulatory regions [ 30 ] , including rep - lication origins [ 31 ] , telomeres [ 32 ] , promoters , as well as 5 ′ and 3 ′ UTRs [ 33 , 34 ] . It has been well established that GQs which are present in the 3 ′ UTR of mRNAs can regulate the subcellular localization of these transcripts in certain cells like neurons [ 35 , 36 ] . Low serum folate levels have been shown to be asso - ciated with increased tumorigenicity [ 37 – 41 ] and enhanced metastasis [ 41 – 43 ] . Invasiveness and metasta - sis may be induced in the search for folates via chemot - actic mechanisms . In this respect , we herein uncovered that the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS , the GQ motifs in particular , induce cell invasion in response to pulse folic acid ( FA ) repletion , suggesting a role in tumor progression , migra - tion , and metastasis under low folate conditions in the tumor microenvironment . This suggests a role for FPGS , not only in intracellular folate retention and homeostasis , but also in folate sensing and chemotaxis , highlighting FPGS 3 ′ UTR GQ motifs as an attractive druggable target for inhibition of cancer migration and invasion . Results and discussion G‑quadruplex elements in the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS mRNA are required for its translocation to cell protrusions In our recent study [ 26 ] , multiple actin binding / modu - lating proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation as cFPGS interactors , including cofilin 1 ( CFL1 ) , vincu - lin ( VCL ) , fascin ( FSCN1 ) , cortactin ( CTTN ) , IQ motif containing GTPase - activating protein 1 ( IQGAP1 ) , and talin - 1 ( TLN1 ) . Actin was not identified as an interac - tor , although immunofluorescence ( IF ) microscopy did demonstrate the co - localization of cFPGS and actin on sub - membranous actin stretches . Since many of these proteins are components of the actin machinery that regulates the formation and stabilization of cell protru - sions for migration ( i . e . , pseudopodia , filopodia ) [ 5 , 44 ] and invasion ( i . e . , invadopodia ) [ 45 , 46 ] , we hypothesized that cFPGS might localize to said protrusions to sustain cell migration and invasion in response to specific cues . Given that various protrusion - localized proteins were shown to be locally translated at the cell edges following the transport of their mRNA [ 47 ] , e . g . , CFL1 [ 48 ] , VCL [ 49 ] , actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 ) [ 50 ] , and β - actin [ 51 ] , we set to explore whether this is also true for cFPGS . The primary element shown to govern cellular mRNA localization is the 3 ′ UTR ; this was shown exten - sively in neuronal cells [ 52 – 54 ] and for protrusion - local - ized proteins such as β - actin [ 55 ] , CFL1 [ 48 ] , RAB13 [ 56 ] , and STAT3 [ 57 , 58 ] . Hence , we utilized the well - estab - lished MBSV6 - MCP reporter system [ 59 ] to determine Page 3 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 the subcellular localization of cFPGS mRNA . To this end , the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS was subcloned into the pRK5 / FLAG - cFPGS ( F - cFPGS ) expression vector [ 26 ] and the sequence of 24xMS2V6 loops was inserted therein , as detailed in the “Methods” section ( Fig . 1A ) to yield the desired F - MS2 construct . The point of insertion of the 24xMS2V6 loops was selected carefully , to avoid the dis - ruption of any regulatory element in the 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 1B ) . To gain a qualitative proof of concept that cFPGS mRNA localizes at cell protrusions , we induced cell migration and pseudopodia formation by the routinely used method of serum starvation and repletion . F - MS2 and MS2 - coat protein ( MCP ) - GFP co - transfected cells were grown over night in serum - free medium , after which they were incubated for 1 . 5 h in complete growth medium , fixed , and scanned using a confocal microscope . The subcellular localization of the exogenous cFPGS mRNA was monitored by following the green MCP - GFP fluorescence , and compared between cells that were grown under complete medium ( Fig . 2A , B ) , serum - deprived ( Fig . 2C , D ) , and serum - repleted ( Fig . 2E , F ) conditions . Actin staining was used to visualize the boundaries of the cells . In full growth medium , the F - MS2 mRNA was evenly distributed in the cells , with occasional high accumulation foci at cell protrusions ( Fig . 2A , arrows ) . Whereas under serum deprivation , cells displayed less protrusions as previously shown [ 60 ] , and F - MS2 mRNA was absent from the cell periph - ery ( Fig . 2C ) . In contrast , upon serum repletion , F - MS2 mRNA was transported and accumulated at the edges of the newly formed , serum - induced filopodia ( Fig . 2E , arrows ) . Consistently , FPGS mRNA was previously found to be enriched in protrusions of highly metastatic hepa - tocellular carcinoma cells [ 58 ] . Following the demonstration of the possible regulated transport of cFPGS mRNA to cell protrusions , we set to identify the element ( s ) within the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS that govern ( s ) this translocation . Previous studies implicated GQ sequences in the 3 ′ UTR of various neuronal genes , as the binding elements for RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) , that allowed the regulated transport of mRNAs to neu - ronal projections [ 35 , 61 ] . It is reasonable that the same mechanism exists in non - neuronal cells , as several RBPs that were identified as GQ - binding proteins ( GQBPs ) [ 62 – 64 ] also transport RNA molecules to protrusions of migrating cells , such as fragile X mental retardation pro - tein 1 ( FMRP / FMR1 ) [ 57 ] , or are a component of ribo - nucleoprotein complexes transported to cell protrusions , such as the RNA helicase DEAD box protein 3 , X isoform ( DDX3 ) [ 65 ] , and the oncogene fused in sarcoma ( FUS ) Fig . 1 . The 3 ′ UTR of FPGS . A Schematic illustration of the 3 ′ UTR and 24xMS2 sequences added to the FLAG - cFPGS expression vector . B Prediction of regulatory elements within the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS and the insertion position of the 24xMS2 sequence Page 4 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 [ 66 ] . Since the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS is predicted to harbor two GQ sequences , we analyzed the 3 ′ UTR of various protru - sion - localized RNAs [ 48 , 50 , 56 – 58 , 67 – 73 ] for the pres - ence of GQ elements and compared their score to that of FPGS using the QGRS Mapper tool ( Table 1 ) . Although two - quartet GQs ( i . e . , GG 4 ) have been recently identified and shown to form secondary structures [ 74 – 76 ] , they have yet to be implicated in RNA transport and have low prediction scores ; hence , we restricted the analyses to a minimum of three G runs ( i . e . , GGG 4 ) and a maximum GQ length of 45 bp . Although the functional impor - tance of the GQ elements shown in Table 1 has not been experimentally validated , except for the GQ of CAMK2A [ 35 , 77 ] , the mRNAs of CAMK2A , CFL1 , and STAT3 are dependent on their 3 ′ UTR for transport to cell protru - sions [ 48 , 57 , 72 ] , and all three are binding substrates of FMRP [ 57 , 78 , 79 ] ; the latter has been shown to bind the majority of its RNA substrates through a GQ element [ 36 , 61 , 62 , 80 ] . The actin crosslinkers filamin A and B ( FLNA and FLNB ) [ 81 ] were also found among FMRP’s binding substrates [ 82 ] . As evident from Table 1 , the G - scores of the GQs of FPGS are comparable and even higher than those of CFL1 , FLNA , FLNB , STAT3 , and CAMK2A . Functional UTR GQs have been shown to be selectively constrained [ 33 ] and it has been suggested that universal selection for GQ formation in the UTRs of eukaryotic genomes may be related to the biological functions of GQs [ 83 ] . Indeed , an initial examination of the 3 ′ UTR sequences of FPGS orthologs suggests that the GQ motifs are con - served around the same position in Mammalia , and even in Lepidosauria ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . In order to evaluate the conservation of the GQs in FPGS 3 ′ UTR during vertebrate evolution , we obtained the 3 ′ UTR sequences of FPGS homologs from diverse vertebrate species from the RefSeq database and analyzed them using QGRS mapper to predict the top two scoring GQs . To test whether the predicted GQs were a reflection of the G / C content of the 3 ′ UTR or a specific preference for GQ - forming sequences , we further compared the real 3 ′ UTR sequences to sequences with the same com - position that were randomly shuffled . Comparison of the QGRS mapping scores has shown that the FPGS 3 ′ UTR had a significantly strong preference to form two non - overlapping GQs than expected by chance in most amni - ote species ( Additional file 2 : Figure S1 ) . In most cases , the top two scoring GQs also had a better score than that predicted by chance in the sequences with the same nucleotide composition . This shows that the sequence in amniotes evolved under conditions that preferentially retain the potential to form two distinct GQs , likely due to their functional roles in subcellular RNA localization . Collectively , these data suggest that the FPGS 3 ′ UTR GQ sequences should be considered functional regulatory elements . Fig . 2 . Confocal microscopy imaging of the subcellular localization of exogenous cFPGS mRNA harboring its native 3 ′ UTR . HeLa cells co - transfected with FLAG - cFPGS - 3 ′ UTR - 24xMS2 ( F - MS2 ) and MCP - GFP were grown in full growth medium ( A , D ) , serum - free medium ( 16 h , B , E ) , and serum - repleted medium ( 1 . 5 h , C , F ) . Fixed cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( nuclei , blue fluorescence , 405 nm ) and phalloidin ( white , 630 nm ) and were scanned using a confocal microscope ( × 63 magnitude ) . F - MS2 mRNA was detected by the green fluorescence of bound MCP - GFP ( 488 nm ) . Arrows point to cell protrusions with accumulated mRNA . Scale bars denote 10 μm . Shown are representative images of three independent experiments Page 5 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 To explore the possible contribution of these GQ ele - ments to the transport of cFPGS mRNA to cell protru - sions , we mutated each element separately on the F - MS2 expression vector and repeated the fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) - induction assay . Herein , we used IF microscopy to visualize the cell’s boundaries with filamentous actin ( F - actin ) along with the cFPGS protein . As depicted in Fig . 3 , the disruption of each GQ was sufficient to abrogate the transport of FPGS mRNA to cell protru - sions upon serum repletion . The mRNA appeared to be retained in the cell body , presumably in the ER area ( Fig . 3 F and K ) ; this coincides with our previous hypoth - esis , suggesting that cFPGS is translated and transported through the ER - Golgi network [ 26 ] . Each of the two GQ elements appears to have a pivotal role in the subcellular transport of FPGS mRNA . This implies either of the fol - lowing : ( 1 ) a cooperative binding of the GQs by two RBPs [ 84 ] , ( 2 ) the two GQs oligomerize to a higher order struc - ture which is bound / stabilized by an RBP [ 85 – 87 ] , or ( 3 ) binding of the two GQs by a single RBP harboring multi - ple binding sites , resulting in 3 ′ UTR bending [ 88 , 89 ] . To ensure complete abolishment of cFPGS mRNA transport , we generated a double GQ mutant ( F - MS2 - dmGQ ) and used this construct upon subsequent experiments . Inter - estingly , the exogenous cFPGS protein ( detected by an anti - FLAG antibody ) colocalized with its cognate mRNA ( Fig . 3 D , I , N ) , suggesting the localized translation of cFPGS , as was shown for various protrusion - localized proteins [ 68 , 90 ] . cFPGS mRNA transport to cell protrusions is induced upon FA repletion and is GQ‑ and F‑actin‑dependent FPGS is a key regulator of intracellular folate retention and homeostasis [ 19 ] and FA is a known chemoattractant [ 91 – 94 ] crucial for the migration and invasion of A549 non - small cell lung cells [ 10 ] as well as prostate cancer cells [ 95 ] . Moreover , a 24 - h FA deprivation in HeLa cells consistently resulted in an increase in both migration and invasion [ 96 ] . Based on these findings , we explored the subcellular localization of cFPGS mRNA upon FA reple - tion . To this end , HeLa cells were deprived of FA for 14 days ; on day 13 , cells were transfected with F - MS2 and studied the next day by live fluorescence microscopy Table 1 G - quadruplex sequences found by QGRS Mapper in the 3 ′ UTR of cell protrusion - localized RNAs FPGS folylpolyglutamate synthase , CFL1 cofilin 1 , FSCN1 fascin , FLNA filamin A , FLNB filamin B , RAB13 Ras - related protein Rab - 13 , ACTR2 actin - related protein 2 , ARPC4 actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex subunit 4 , STAT3 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 , CAMK2A calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha , CAPZB F - actin - capping protein subunit beta a Nucleotide position within the 3 ′ UTR b Reference papers demonstrating the protrusion localization / enrichment of each RNA Gene Accession Position a Length QGs G‑score Ref b FPGS NM _ 004957 116 22 GGG GCCA GGG CTTT GGG ATGGG 70 58 , current 377 36 GGG AAG GGA GAGGG CCT CTG CCT GGG ACA CTG CGGG 70 CFL1 NM _ 005507 89 29 GGG CTGGG GGG ATC CCA GCA GGG GGA GGG 66 48 , 58 , 69 FSCN1 NM _ 003088 339 28 GGG ACG GTT GGG GGCT GGG AGC CCT GGG 70 58 , 70 493 23 GGG AAGGG AAG CTG TCGGG TGGG 65 670 19 GGG CGGG TAG GGG TGT GGG 70 FLNA NM _ 001456 233 20 GGG AGGGG TGA GGG ATG GGG 71 58 , 69 FLNB NM _ 001457 1028 44 GGG TCT TTG GCC TGA AAGTT GGG AAT GGT TGGG GGA GAG AAGGG 62 58 , 69 RAB13 NM _ 002870 57 40 GGG AGT GAG CAG GGG AGA AAT AGC AGA GGG GCT TGG AGGG 67 56 , 69 , 71 , 72 ACTR2 NM _ 005722 399 29 GGG ATGGG GGG TGG TTC GGG ATG GGT GGG 71 50 , 70 , 73 564 33 GGG TTT TGT TGC GGG GGGGA GGG TAA CAA TGGG 68 1819 39 GGG CCC GTA CCT ACT GGC AGT TGGG TTCA GGG AAAT GGG 57 ARPC4 NM _ 005718 96 20 GGG AGTT GGG TTGGG GTGGG 70 69 , 72 626 44 GGG GCC CAA AAGCC GGG CAA CCT CTG GCT ACA GGG GCC ATT GGG 63 STAT3 NM _ 139276 248 28 GGG GAT GTG GCGGG GGG TGG CTA GAGGG 64 57 , 58 1989 43 GGG CTT ACC ATT GGG TTT AAA TCATA GGG ACC TAG GGCGA GGG 70 CAMK2A NM _ 015981 335 37 GGG CTG GTG CCC ACC AGGG GCTG GGG AGA AGG AGGGG 63 67 , 68 886 39 GGG TCA GGT TGGAA GGG GTG TAG GAAGA GGG GTGAG GGG 66 2674 39 GGG TGGG CAG CCA CCT GGT GCC ACC ACA GGG CACCA GGG 52 3134 30 GGG GGG GGC GGG TGG GAT GGG AAG AAG GGG 72 CAPZB NM _ 004930 453 26 GGGG TTG GGGG TCGT GGGG ACA GGGG 107 58 , 70 , 72 547 20 GGGG TGGGGG CTGGG GGG GG 106 Page 6 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 imaging before and after the addition of 2 μM FA . Fig - ure 4A depicts examples of individual cells , at different time points following FA addition , where cFPGS mRNA accumulation coincided with the elongation of a cell protrusion ( Fig . 4A , top ) or occurred in preexisting pro - trusions ( Fig . 4A bottom ) . RNA accumulation at cell pro - trusions was most apparent around ~ 15min , after which the accumulated mRNA became dispersed . The experi - ment was repeated with the use of the F - MS2 - dmGQ construct ( Fig . 4B ) , which resulted in the lack of cFPGS mRNA accumulation during the same time frame . We have therefore chosen to conduct further experiments using a 15 - min FA repletion pulse . Next , to be able to efficiently quantify the FA - depend - ent transport of cFPGS mRNA to cell protrusions , and to evaluate the requirement of the 3 ′ UTR GQ elements to this transport , we performed IF microscopy . HeLa cells deprived of FA were co - transfected with MCP - GFP along with either F - MS2 or F - MS2 - dmGQ and subjected to a FA repletion pulse , following which cells were fixed and reacted with an anti - FLAG antibody . The results obtained with the FA pulse ( Fig . 5 ) were identical to those after FBS repletion ( Fig . 3 ) . Fifty - three percent of cells harboring F - MS2 displayed pro - trusion - localized cFPGS mRNA following a FA pulse ( Fig . 5F , P ) , compared to only 3 . 8 % of F - MS2 - dmGQ harboring cells ( Fig . 5K , P ) , the same percentage as in FA - starved cells ( i . e . , 3 . 9 % , Fig . 5A , P ) . To further cor - roborate these findings , we utilized antisense oligonu - cleotides ( ASOs ) against the FPGS 3 ′ UTR GQs . ASOs have been recently utilized for sequence - specific inhi - bition of RNA GQ folding , thus reducing protein trans - lation [ 97 – 99 ] . We here employed the same technique with the aim to abrogate the FA - induced cell protrusion localization of cFPGS mRNA . While the non - targeted ASO - Ctr had no effect on cFPGS mRNA localization following a 15 - min FA - pulse repletion , each of the GQ - targeted ASOs alone reduced the percentage of cells with protrusion - localized mRNA by ~ 50 % ( Fig . 5Q ) . No further reduction was observed when both ASOs were used together , corroborating their cooperative role in cFPGS mRNA localization in response to FA repletion . Fig . 3 . Disruption of the GQ elements at the 3 ′ UTR of cFPGS mRNA abolishes its transport to cell protrusions . HeLa cells were co - transfected with MCP - GFP and FLAG - cFPGS - 3 ′ UTR - 24xMS2 ( F - MS2 ) harboring either the WT UTR ( A – E ) , a mutated GQ at position 116 ( mGQ116 , F – J ) , or a mutated GQ at position 377 ( mGQ377 , K – O ) . Following 16 h of serum deprivation , cells were supplemented with complete growth medium for 1 . 5 h , fixed and subjected to IF microscopy . The localization of F - MS2 mRNA is indicated by MCP - GFP ( green fluorescence , 488 nm ) , FLAG - cFPGS protein was detected by an anti - FLAG antibody ( magenta , 405 nm ) , and F - actin was stained by DyLight 650 Phalloidin ( white , 630 nm ) . Cells were scanned using a confocal microscope ( × 63 magnitude ) . The scale bars denote 10 μm . Shown are representative images of three independent experiments Page 7 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 Interestingly , upon FA repletion cells harboring the F - MS2 - dmGQ construct ( Figs . 3 , 4 , and 5 ) presented less protrusions per cell than cells harboring the F - MS2 construct . When comparing the two populations of cells ( 50 cells from each group ) , the average number of protrusions for the WT UTR was 7 ± 1 . 7 vs . 2 . 7 ± 1 . 2 for the dmGQ UTR ( p = 1 . 9 × 10 − 26 ) , suggesting a role for cFPGS mRNA in protrusion formation . Out of the three most studied RBPs mediating the transport of mRNA to cell protrusions , i . e . , FMRP [ 61 , 79 , 100 ] ; adenomatous polyposis coli , APC [ 101 – 103 ] ; and Zipcode binding protein 1 , ZBP1 [ 104 , 105 ] , only FMRP recognizes and binds RNA GQs [ 61 , 62 , 106 ] . Since FMRP is dependent on microtubules for mRNA trans - port [ 107 , 108 ] , and as we have previously demonstrated the association of the cFPGS protein with the cellular Fig . 4 . Time - lapse depiction of FA - induced cFPGS mRNA accumulation in a cell protrusion . HeLa cells deprived of FA for 13 days were co - transfected with MCP - GFP along with either F - MS2 ( A ) or F - MS2 - dmGQ ( B ) . The next day , the distribution of cFPGS mRNA ( MCP - GFP , 488 nm ) was monitored in single cells by live fluorescence imaging before ( t = 0 ) and after the addition of 2μM FA to the growth medium . Cells were scanned with a confocal microscope ( × 63 magnitude ) . The scale bars denote 10 μm Page 8 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 cytoskeletal network , primarily with microtubules [ 26 ] , we explored the dependence on microtubules for the FA - induced protrusion localization of cFPGS mRNA ( Fig . 6 ) . Following FA deprivation , transfected cells were pre - treated with the microtubule depolymerizing agent vinblastine ( VBT ) [ 109 ] for 1 h before FA repletion ; cells were then fixed and subjected to IF microscopy . Surpris - ingly , VBT did not hinder the accumulation of cFPGS mRNA and protein in cell protrusions ( Fig . 6F – J ) . In fact , the percentage of cells with localized mRNA was greater Fig . 5 .

To verify that the micro - tubules were disrupted by VBT , cells were reacted with an anti - α - tubulin ( α - Tub ) antibody ( Additional file 2 : Fig - ure S2 ) . Indeed , following VBT treatment , microtubules appeared as short rod - like crystals as previously shown ( Additional file 2 : compare Figure S2L & Q to S2B & G ) Fig . 6 . cFPGS mRNA transport to cell protrusions is dependent on actin filaments . HeLa cells , deprived of FA for 12 days , were co - transfected with MCP - GFP along with either F - MS2 ( A – T ) or F - MS2 - dmGQ ( U – Y ) . The next day , each cell group was split into different wells and left to grow in FA - free medium for an additional 24 h . Cells were pre - treated for 1 h with 0 . 1 % DMSO ( vehicle , A – E ) , 40 μM VBT ( F – J ) , 10 μM NCZ ( K – O ) , or 250 nM LAN B ( P – Y ) and supplemented with 2 μM FA for 15 min before fixation and IF microscopy . The localization of cFPGS mRNA is indicated by MCP - GFP ( green fluorescence , 488 nm ) , FLAG - cFPGS protein was detected by an anti - FLAG antibody ( red , 405 nm ) , and F - actin was stained by DyLight 650 Phalloidin ( white , 630 nm ) . T The silhouette of the cells was outlined with a purple line . Cells were scanned using a confocal microscope ( × 63 magnitude ) . The scale bars denote 10 μm . Shown are representative images of three independent experiments Page 10 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 [ 110 , 111 ] , while cFPGS protein accumulated in cell pro - trusions ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2K & P ) . The micro - tubule - independent transport of cFPGS mRNA was also confirmed with the microtubule dynamics disrupting agent nocodazole ( NCZ ) [ 112 ] ( Fig . 6K – O ) . The disruption of microtubules not only increased the percentage of cells with protrusion - localized cFPGS mRNA after a 15 - min FA pulse , but also increased the residence time of said mRNA in protrusions . While drug - free cells exhibited mRNA dispersion after ~ 30 min ( Fig . 3 ) , with no cells harboring localized mRNA after 2 h ( Additional file 2 : Figure S3 A , C ) , VBT - treated cells retained the protrusion and the localized mRNA even after 3 h ( Additional file 2 : Figure S3 , E , G ) . Previ - ous studies demonstrated that filopodia remain intact and motile after disruption of microtubule with VBT and / or NCZ [ 113 , 114 ] . Although many studies describe the transport of mRNA to cell protrusions , we could not find any publication describing the fate of mRNA after its local translation ; does it undergo dispersion or deg - radation ? Our current results suggest that while micro - tubules are not required for cFPGS mRNA transport to cell protrusions , they are required for mRNA retrograde transport / degradation . As ZBP1 was shown to use actin filaments for RNA transport [ 51 , 105 ] , in addition to microtubule , we pre - treated the cells with the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B ( LAN B ) before FA - repletion ( Fig . 6P – T ) . Under these inhibitory conditions , both cFPGS mRNA and protein co - localized with actin in large aggregates without reaching the cell edges . Since mutating the GQ elements in the FPGS 3 ′ UTR disrupted mRNA trans - port to cell protrusions ( Fig . 5 ) , we hypothesized that it will abolish the physical connection between the mutated transcript and the actin cytoskeleton . Indeed , when cells were transfected with the MS2 - dmGQ construct prior to LAN B treatment , cFPGS mRNA was distributed within the cells and not aggregated along with actin ( Fig . 6U – Y ) . Moreover , the cFPGS protein , translated from the MS2 - dmGQ construct , did not aggregate with actin as did the protein from the WT transcript ( Fig . 6 , compare V to Q ) , suggesting that cFPGS is not only locally translated at cell protrusions , as shown for many mRNAs [ 68 ] , but is also translated while in transit , as was previously demon - strated [ 90 ] . As detailed in the “Methods” section , a point muta - tion resulting in a V525A substitution ( V567 in the mitochondrial FPGS isoform ) was introduced close to the C - terminus of cFPGS , to facilitate the subcloning of the 3 ′ UTR into the pRK5 expression vector . When we performed IF microscopy with this V525A mutated construct , termed F - cFPGS - V525A , to ensure that the mutation did not interfere with the localization of the cFPGS protein , we were surprised to find it in perinu - clear vesicles ( Additional file 2 : Figure S4 , A - D ) . This vesicular localization of cFPGS - V525A resembled that of the WT cFPGS which we previously reported , follow - ing treatment with LAN B and brefeldin A [ 26 ] . Based on our hypothesis that cFPGS translation and sorting occur through the ER - Golgi network [ 26 ] , the V525A substitu - tion might disrupt the ER export signal of cFPGS , as a single C - terminal valine was shown to operate as a strong ER export signal [ 115 ] . Consistently , previous findings revealed that a C - terminal valine is involved in the rapid and selective ER export of the FXYD7 protein , a regula - tor of Na + / K + ATPase [ 116 ] . Indeed , cFPGS V525 which is located in a conserved hydrophobic patch , is com - pletely conserved across eukaryotes , suggesting it is an essential residue . This substitution was corrected before further experiments were performed ; however , since we had indications that cFPGS mRNA undergoes translation while in transit and / or protrusion - localized translation , the FLAG - cFPGS - V525A - 3 ′ UTR expression vector was used to explore this possibility . FA - depleted cells were transfected with said plasmid and used for IF microscopy before and after a pulse repletion with FA ( Additional file 2 : Figure S4 ) . Under FA starvation , the cFPGS - V525A protein appeared in intracellular clusters ( Additional file 2 : Figure S4 , E and K ) which were juxtaposed to the ER marker calnexin ( CANX ) ( Additional file 2 : Figure S4 , G , H and M ) . However , following a 15 - min FA pulse , cFPGS - V525A assumed a dispersed localization and reached the cell periphery ( Additional file 2 : Figure S4 , P and U , arrows ) . This suggests that following FA repletion , cFPGS - V525A was not retained in the ER since it was not translated therein . These results support both the ER as the first station for cFPGS mRNA and the regulation of its site of translation—either in the ER or cell protrusions . FA‑induced cFPGS mRNA transport to cell protrusions is dependent on the RhoA pathway Actin - dependent RNA transport to cell protrusions is not very common and has been primarily studied with β - actin mRNA [ 117 , 118 ] , which is transported by the actin - dependent RBP ZBP1 [ 51 , 105 ] . The dependence on actin for cFPGS mRNA transport is interesting , as the Krupenko group showed that the actin cytoskeleton is affected by dietary folates through the phosphorylation state of CFL1 , i . e . , folate deprivation results in decreased levels of inactive phosphorylated CFL1 ( pCFL1 ) [ 10 , 119 ] . Activated CFL1 depolymerizes and severs actin filaments , whereas pCFL1 dissociates from G / F actin as a result of reduced affinity [ 120 ] . The regulation of CFL1 phosphorylation is governed by a RhoA - dependent cas - cade [ 10 , 121 ] , whereas the localization and activation of RhoA is regulated by its methylation state [ 10 , 122 ] ; Page 11 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 inactivated RhoA is anchored to the ER membrane via a prenyl moiety and is released upon prenylcysteine car - boxymethylation [ 10 ] . FA , as a one - carbon unit donor in multiple cellular reactions , is required for SAM - depend - ent methylation [ 14 , 123 ] , and as such folate deprivation results in an ER - bound inactive RhoA [ 10 ] . The depend - ency of RhoA on carboxymethylation led Oleinik et . al . to conclude that RhoA is an immediate cellular sensor of FA status [ 10 ] . As β - actin mRNA delivery to cell protrusions was shown to be dependent on Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) and myosin II [ 117 , 118 ] , and since RhoA activ - ity can be regulated by FA , it is plausible that RhoA senses the folate cue which initiates the transport of FPGS mRNA to the periphery . We utilized several inhibi - tors of the RhoA pathway to determine whether it is required for the transport of cFPGS mRNA to cell pro - trusions ( Fig . 7A ) : Cysmethynil ( CyMl ) is a potent inhibi - tor of protein - S - isoprenylcysteine O - methyltransferase ( ICMT ) [ 124 , 125 ] which carboxymethylates RhoA [ 122 , 126 ] among other proteins . Y27632 is a bona fide inhibi - tor of the RhoA effectors ROCK 1 / 2 [ 127 ] . Blebbistatin ( Blebb ) is an inhibitor of the ATPase and gliding motility activities of myosin II [ 128 , 129 ] . Treatment with any of these three inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of cells exhibiting cFPGS mRNA locali - zation at cell protrusions upon FA repletion ( Fig . 7B ) , indicating the importance of the RhoA pathway to FPGS mRNA transport to cell protrusions . We propose a feedback loop between RhoA and cFPGS : Under FA deprivation , cFPGS is retained at the ER—from which it can be transported , in a microtubule - dependent rout , to intracellular locations of folate metabolism— where the FA sensor RhoA resides . Upon FA repletion and methylation of RhoA , it activates the pathway lead - ing to cFPGS mRNA transport and translation at cell peripheries , where the FPGS enzyme—by rapid polyglu - tamylation—enables the accumulation of folates neces - sary for actin remodeling and cell migration . The 3 ′ UTR GQs of FPGS are required for a FA‑induced cell invasion phenotype To examine the validity of this putative feedback loop and explore the possible FA - dependent induction of an invasive phenotype , we utilized an inverted invasion assay [ 130 , 131 ] . The following are the considerations for using this specific assay in which cells plated at the bottom of the well invade the top collagen ( Col ) matrix : ( 1 ) The widely used Boyden chamber Transwell invasion assay utilizes a commercially available basement mem - brane matrix , such as Matrigel or Cultrex , which con - sist of DMEM medium [ 132 , 133 ] . DMEM contains ~ 9 μM FA , hence curtailing any assessment of FA - induced invasion potential . In contrast , the inverted invasion assay we utilized employs pure Col solubilized in acetic acid solution ; this allows for the exogenous addition of a FA - containing medium on top of the FA - free collagen . ( 2 ) The basis for refraining from using the conventional Transwell system is the poor diffusion of medium com - ponents including FA from the bottom chamber with FA - containing medium into the upper Col matrix , pre - cluding a FA - driven chemotactic effect and hence pre - venting any possibility of migration and invasion towards the Col matrix . The current inverted assay allows for the gravitational percolation of the growth medium into the Col gel sieve . As such , the bottom - plated cells can undergo an upwardly directed migration and invasion into the FA - containing Col in a chemotactic manner , as compared to a FA - free collagen . In traditional invasion assays , the Matrigel is supplemented with 1 % FBS , thus allowing the cells to invade the growth factor - containing matrix and migrate close to the Transwell membrane where a micro - gradient of growth hormones induces the directional invasion of the cells to the underlaid growth medium containing 10 % FBS . ( 3 ) The inverted invasion assay allows physical confinement where cell migra - tion is dependent on the RhoA pathway [ 134 , 135 ] . A concentration of 2 . 4 mg / ml type I collagen , used in this protocol , should generate a confined space with ~ 3 - μm Fig . 7 . The RhoA - ROCK - Myosin II pathway is required for the transport of cFPGS mRNA to cell protrusions . HeLa cells , deprived of FA for 12 days , were co - transfected with MCP - GFP and F - MS2 . The next day , transfected cells were split into 5 wells and left to grow in FA - free medium for an additional 24 h . Cells were pre - treated for 1 h with 0 . 1 % DMSO ( vehicle , A – C ) , 30 μM CyMl ( D – F ) , 20 μM Y27632 ( G – I ) , or 15 μM Blebb ( J – L ) and supplemented with 2 μM FA for 15 min before fixation and microscopy . The localization of cFPGS mRNA is indicated by MCP - GFP ( green fluorescence , 488 nm ) and F - actin is stained by DyLight 650 Phalloidin ( white , 630 nm ) . Cells were scanned using a confocal microscope ( × 63 magnitude ) . The scale bars denote 10 μm . Shown are representative images of three independent experiments .

N Illustration of the RhoA - ROCK - Myosin II pathway and the sites of pharmacological inhibition used ( marked by a stop sign ) . RhoA is anchored to the ER membrane via a prenyl moiety and is retained therein under folate deprivation . Elevated levels of tetrahydrofolate cofactors increase the availability of S - adenosylmethionine ( Me ) leading to the carboxymethylation of RhoA by ICMT , which can be inhibited by CyMl . Following carboxymethylation RhoA is released from the ER and translocates to the plasma membrane , where it activates ROCK1 / 2 ; the latter can be inhibited by Y27632 . ROCK activates myosin II by both phosphorylating the myosin light chain ( MLC ) and inhibiting the activity of MLC - phosphatase ( MLCP ) . Myosin ATPase activity can be inhibited by Blebb ( See figure on next page . ) Page 12 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 diameter pores [ 136 – 138 ] . Various cell lines , including HeLa , switch to a fast amoeboid migration phenotype , which includes the formation of a stable bleb [ 135 , 139 , 140 ] . FA - deprived cells were transfected separately with a construct for either cFPGS without a 3 ′ UTR ( F - cFPGS ) , F - MS2 , or F - MS2 - dmGQ . Each construct was co - trans - fected with an expression vector harboring a fluorescent protein to allow monitoring by fluorescence microscopy , Fig . 7 . ( See legend on previous page . ) Page 13 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 i . e . , F - cFPGS & BFP , F - MS2 & GFP , and F - MS2 - dmGQ & RFP . Cells were mixed , seeded on glass plates , and overlaid with Col under three conditions : FA - containing Col immersed in FA - containing medium , FA - free Col immersed in FA - free medium , and FA - free Col immersed in FA - containing medium ( Additional file 2 : Figure S5 ) . Cells were incubated for 40 h before they were visualized by live confocal imaging using focus stacking to record images at different focal planes ( i . e . , Z - stacks ) , allowing the generation of 3D images , and measure the spreading distance of each cell ( Fig . 8 and Additional files 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 : movies S1 - S9 ) . When FA was present in the cells’ immediate surround - ings ( i . e . , within the Col ) , cells harboring F - cFPGS and F - MS2 developed a single bleb per cell , either from the cell body or from a protrusion , and the blebs developed in an upward direction , i . e . , the leading edge ( Fig . 8A , D , Additional file 3 , 6 : movies S1 , S4 ) . This is consist - ent with leader bleb - based migration [ 139 , 141 , 142 ] , although the cells here were not round and maintained normal cell protrusions . Metastatic cancer cells were previously shown to have the ability to switch between protrusion types to optimize their migration in different environments [ 143 , 144 ] and even exhibit an amoeboid / mesenchymal hybrid phenotype [ 145 ] under the control of RhoA [ 146 ] . Indeed , for cancer metastasis to occur , malignant cells must traverse a range of tissue environ - ments with diverse physicochemical properties ; this is accomplished , at least in part , by cells adjusting their migration mode to one that is best suited to the actual environment [ 147 ] . Blebs were shown to act as sites of extracellular matrix adhesion and re - organization dur - ing hybrid mode cell invasion [ 145 ] . In contrast , cells expressing F - MS2 - dmGQ failed to develop any bleb ( Fig . 8G , Additional file 9 : movie S7 ) . Each cell spanned ≤ 10 μm on the Z axis , excluding F - MS2 - harboring cells which had very large blebs . Clearly , in the presence of FA , there was no need for the cells to spread out as FA was readily available . Under FA deprivation , the blebs were under the cells , following and not leading ( Fig . 8B , E , H , Additional files 4 , 7 , 10 : movies S2 , S5 , S8 ) . This was the only condition under which some F - MS2 - dmGQ harboring cells developed blebs ( Fig . 8 , compare H to G and I ) ; however , they were relatively small . Interestingly , while the blebs that were formed under the expression of F - MS2 seemed to have higher content density than the cell body ( i . e . , higher fluorescent intensity , Fig . 8E , Addi - tional file 7 : movie S5 ) , the blebs that were formed in the other cells displayed very weak fluorescence , making them appear almost transparent ( Fig . 8B , H , Additional files 4 , 10 : movies S2 , S8 ) , suggesting a different compo - sition of these blebs resulting from uneven distribution of the cytosolic content between the cell body and the bleb . Interestingly , leading pseudopods of invading cells are characterized by a higher cell mass density [ 148 ] . In the pursuit of FA , cells spread a longer distance reaching ~ 20 μm , and yet the blebs were close to the cell body . The most significant changes in cellular behavior elicited by the three FPGS constructs were observed when FA was supplemented in the growth medium , slowly diffusing into the Col matrix as a vitamin chemoattractant . Cells expressing the UTR - null cFPGS transcript resembled those growing in the presence of FA , i . e . , one upward - directed leader bleb per cell and short distance spreading ( Fig . 8C , Additional file 5 : movie S3 ) . When the 3 ′ UTR GQs were mutated , cells did not develop any blebs and cell spreading was < 10 μm ( Fig . 8I , Additional file 11 : Movie S9 ) . In stark contrast , cells expressing FPGS with the WT UTR exhibited multiple blebs , with varying sizes , locations , and directions ( Fig . 8F , Additional file 8 : movie S6 ) , with each cell spreading ≥ 15 μm . Additional file 2 : Figure S6 allows to compare the morphology of cells harboring the WT UTR and dmGQ - UTR within the same growth area when FA - containing medium was added on top of the Col gel . FPGS WT - UTR , but not the dmGQ - UTR , induced the formation of leading blebs and invasion higher into the Col matrix . F - MS2 bearing cells developed protrusions from which blebs were formed and occasionally released ( Fig . 8F , J , K , arrows ) ; a string of vesicles formed at the tip of a cell protrusion ( Fig . 8J ) was released when a new bleb formed at said protrusion ( Fig . 8K ) . Tumor cell blebbing and vesicle shedding are known phenomena that facilitate migration and invasion [ 149 – 151 ] , specifically the very large oncosomes which contain matrix metalloproteinases , among others [ 152 , 153 ] . A leader bleb can force its way forward by a net transfer of cytoplasm in the direction of migration [ 144 ] , hence ( See figure on next page . ) Fig . 8 . The 3 ′ UTR of FPGS enhances cell migration under confined conditions . FA - deprived HeLa cells , co - transfected with either F - cFPGS ( 3 ′ UTR - null ) and BFP ( A – C ) , F - MS2 and GFP ( D – F , J , K ) , or F - MS2 - dmGQ and RFP ( G – I ) , were overlaid with FA - containing collagen and medium ( A , D , G ) , FA - free collagen and medium ( B , E , H ) , or FA - free collagen and FA - containing medium ( C , F , I – K ) as detailed in Figure S1 . Following 40 h of incubation , cells were visualized by confocal microscopy using focus stacking ( i . e . , Z - stacks ) , and 3D semi - translucent images were generated . Each image is shown from both a bottom and top view , with a color gradient representing the depth within the image . J , K Images of the same cell with a 2 . 5 - h interval , during which a string of vesicles detached from the cell protrusion , and a new bleb formed at the tip of the protrusion . Arrows point at vesicles released from cell protrusions . The scale bars denote 10 μm . Transition through the Z - stacks can be seen in the supplementary movies S1 - S9 Page 14 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 Fig . 8 . ( See legend on previous page . ) Page 15 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 the leading edge ( pseudopods and blebs ) was shown to have a higher cell mass density [ 148 ] . We therefor deter - mined the fluorescence intensity of the cell body and the protruding blebs of the Col - invading cells as an indica - tion of the cell mass ( Table 2 ) . Cells transfected with cFPGS expression vectors harboring either no - 3 ′ UTR or mutated 3 ′ UTR exhibited lower fluorescence in the blebs compared to the cell body , with 3 ′ UTR - dmGQ displaying a 4 - fold lower bleb fluorescence . In contrast , cells harbor - ing the WT - 3 ′ UTR exhibited up to 4 - fold higher bleb flu - orescence when compared to the cell body , corroborating the requirement of the FPGS 3 ′ UTR for the development of invasive leading blebs . Conclusions Our novel findings reveal that the GQ motifs in the 3 ′ UTR of FPGS regulate its transcript and protein locali - zation at cell protrusions in response to a folate cue , thereby inducing cancer cell invasion . Previous studies by the group of S . Mili have shown that cancer cell inva - sion requires RNA localization at cell protrusions and the invasive front [ 56 , 102 , 154 ] , hence suggesting RNA localization as a target for interference with cancer cell invasion . Along this vein , the FPGS 3 ′ UTR GQs emerge in our present study as an attractive druggable target for the design of novel therapeutics . While inhibiting FPGS activity may be harmful to healthy tissues , impairing the cell protrusion localization of its mRNA by ASOs , tar - geted to the GQ motifs may inhibit invasion and metas - tasis . In recent years , DNA and RNA GQs have gained much interest as targets for antiviral [ 155 , 156 ] and anti - cancer therapy [ 157 , 158 ] ; studies include , among others , inhibition of the translation of COVID - 19 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [ 159 ] , inhibition of the translation of vascular endothelial growth factor [ 160 ] , and suppres - sion of c - myc transcription [ 161 ] . Thus , disruption of the subcellular localization of well - defined mRNAs may emerge as a novel targeted anticancer treatment strategy which may be enhanced when combined with chemo - therapeutic as well as immunotherapeutic agents .

Expression vectors Primers used in this section are detailed in Table 3 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs ( Ipswich , MA , USA ) . Vectors and inserts were purified using the Wizard PCR & Gel cleanup kit ( # A9281 , Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . Ligations were performed using the DNA Ligation kit 2 . 1 ( # 6022 , TaKaRa Bio , Shiga , Japan ) . All plasmids were sequenced by an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Waltham , MA , USA ) . The pRK5 / FLAG - cFPGS expression vector ( F - cFPGS ) , harboring the ORF of cFPGS with an N - terminal FLAG - tag , was previously described [ 26 ] . The pRK5 / FLAG - cFPGS - 3 ′ UTR - MS2V6 vector ( F - MS2 ) , harboring the ORF of cFPGS with its 3 ′ UTR and the MBSV6 - loop sys - tem [ 59 , 165 ] was generated as follows : • Cloning of the 3 ′ UTR sequence of FPGS was per - formed by 3 ′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( 3 ′ - RACE ) as follows : Following the isolation of total RNA from HeLa cells , using the TRI Reagent RNA Isolation Reagent ( # T9424 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , we per - formed reverse transcription with the High - Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( # AB - 4368814 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) primed by a polyT adapter primer with a customized extension instead of random primers . A first - round PCR was performed using HY TAQ READT MIX ( # EZ - 3007 , hylabs , Rehovot , Israel ) with a specific tar - get forward primer ( FPGS EX11 - up ) and an adapter primer .

Following a NheI - HindIII digestion of the vector and 3 ′ UTR - insert and their ligation , an F - cFPGS - V525A - 3 ′ UTR plasmid was generated .

BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 • The subcloning of the 24xMS2V6 loops system was performed by PCR - amplifying the ~ 1 . 7 Kb MS2 sequence from the pET259 - pUC57 24xMS2V6 plas - mid ( Addgene plasmid # 104391 ) [ 59 ] , using Q5 high - fidelity polymerase ( # M0491 , New England Biolabs ) and the primers MS2 - Fw & MS2 - Rv , followed by digestion with SmaI & XbaI . An EcoRV restriction site was generated in the 3 ′ UTR sequence of pRK5 / FLAG - cFPGS - 3 ′ UTR by SDM with the EcoRV - sdm primers , followed by digestion with EcoRV & XbaI . Ligation yielded the vector F - MS2 . The F - MS2 - mGQ116 and F - MS2 - mGQ377 vec - tors , harboring mutated GQ sequences at the 3 ′ UTR , were generated by SDM using primers GQ116 - sdm and GQ377 - sdm , respectively . Consecutive SDM reactions were used to generate the double mutant F - MS2 - dmGQ . Mutating the GQ sequences did not affect the predicted miRNA - binding sites . The pUbC - nls - ha - stdMCP - stdGFP ( MCP - GFP ) expression vector , harboring a synonymized tandem dimer MCP fused to synonymized tandem dimer GFP , was a gift from Prof . Robert Singer ( Addgene plasmid # 98916 ) [ 166 ] . pcDNA3 . 1 / ZNT1 - Ruby was previously described [ 167 ] . pTurboRFP - C ( # FP231 ) and pTurboGFP - N ( # FP512 ) were from Evrogen ( Moscow , Russia ) . To gen - erate a pTurboBFP - C construct , BFP was PCR - amplified from mTagBFP2 - TOMM20 - N - 10 ( Addgene plasmid # 55328 ) [ 168 ] using the Q5 high - fidelity polymerase and the primers hang - BFP & BFP - XhoI . The pTurboRFP - C vector and BFP insert were digested by AgeI and XhoI , and then ligated . Transfections All transfections were carried out using linear polyethyl - enimine ( PEI , MW 25 , 000 ) transfection reagent ( # 23966 , Polysciences , Warrington , PA , USA ) . Cells were seeded in 24 - well plates ( 4 × 10 4 cells / well ) 24 h prior to transfec - tion . Transfections were performed using 1 μg DNA at a PEI - DNA ratio of 3 : 1 . F - MS2 and MCP - GFP plasmids were co - transfected at a ratio of 2 : 1 . Immunofluorescence ( IF ) and live imaging microscopy Cells grown in complete growth medium or at day 12 of FA deprivation were transfected with the indicated expression vectors . After 16 h , the growth medium was replaced and cells were allowed to recuperate for 2 h , following which cells were trypsinized , and seeded in Eppendorf’s Cell Imaging 24 - well plates ( # EP0030741021 , Hamburg , Germany ) . For FBS - deprivation , the growth medium was replaced with FBS - free medium for a 16 - h incubation period . The next day ( i . e . , day 14 of FA deprivation ) , cells were either fixed ( as detailed below ) or imaged after / during FBS or FA repletion using a confocal Zeiss LSM 710 inverted microscope ( × 63 magnification , Oberkochen , Germany ) during incubation at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . For IF microscopy , cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 15 min with a freshly prepared 4 % formaldehyde solution . This was preceded by 1 h of pre - incubation with 0 . 1 % DMSO ( vehicle ) or the following inhibitors : 40 μM VBT , 10 μM NCZ , 250 nM LAN B , 30 μM CyMl , 20 μM Y27632 or 15 μM Blebb , and 15 - min co - incuba - tion with 2 μM FA . Following fixation , cells were washed twice with PBS for 5 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Tri - ton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min followed by two washes with PBS . Cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) with TBS buffer ( 10 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) containing 20 % skimmed milk and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at RT : 1 : 330 mouse anti - FLAG M2 ( # F1804 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 : 500 rabbit anti - α - tubulin ( # ab4074 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , and 1 : 200 rabbit anti - calnexin ( # ADI - SPA - 860 , Enzo Life Sciences , Farm - ingdale , NY , USA ) . Following three 5 - min washes with PBS , cells were co - incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies along with DyLight 650 Phalloidin ( # 12956 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , for 1 h at RT in the dark : 1 : 400 goat anti - mouse DyLight 405 # 115 - 475 - 062 , 1 : 400 donkey anti - mouse Cy3 # 715 - 165 - 150 , 1 : 400 donkey anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 # 711 - 545 - 152 , or 1 : 400 donkey anti - rabbit DyLight 405 # 711 - 475 - 152 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories , West Grove , PA , USA ) . Cells were then washed three times with PBS for 5 min and once with DDW , topped with Fluoromount - G ( # 00 - 4958 - 02 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and covered with 13 - mm glass coverslips . Fluorescence was recorded using a confocal Zeiss LSM 710 microscope ( × 63 magnification ) , with excitation wavelengths of 405 , 488 , 543 , and 630 nm . Focus stacking was performed with 1 . 5 - μM intervals from the lowest plane in an upwards direction . Confocal microscopy images and movies were processed using the ZEN 3 . 0 SR black edition software ( Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH , Oberkochen , Germany ) . GQ conservation analysis For analysis of GQ conservation , we obtained the 3 ′ UTR sequences of FPGS from different species from the Entrez RefSeq database . For each sequence , we used the com - mand line version of the QGRS mapper ( https : / / bioin forma tics . ramapo . edu / QGRS / index . php ) with default parameters to find the highest scoring GQ in the 3 ′ UTR sequences as well as 100 randomly shuffled sequences of each 3 ′ UTR . The two top - scoring GQs in the actual sequence were compared with those of the randomized sequences , computing an empirical P value for both the Page 18 of 23 Stark et al . BMC Biology ( 2023 ) 21 : 13 top - scoring G quadruplex , as well as for the sum of the scores of the two top - scoring GQs . If no GQ was found by QGRS mapper , a score of zero was assigned . Empirical P values were computed by comparing the score of the actual 3 ′ UTR sequence with the randomized ones . Box plots show the median , 1st and 3rd quartiles , and whisk - ers extend to the further points in the 1 . 5 times the inter - quartile range . cFPGS mRNA localization analyses To determine the percentage of cells with localized cFPGS mRNA , only cells with cytoplasmic MCP were considered ; cells exhibiting only nuclear MCP were dis - missed . Cells were scored as protrusion localized if the MCP signal was significantly higher in cell protrusion ( one or more ) than in the cell body . GQ targeting with antisense oligonucleotides HeLa cells at day 13 of FA - deprivation were transfected with F - MS2 and MCP - GFP along with one of the follow - ing ASOs at a DNA ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 , respectively : a non - targeted control ASO - Ctr which served as a negative control , 5 ′ - ATT CCG GAA TTG ACT GAC TGA CTG A . ASO - GQ116 , 5 ′ - CTC TCC CGG CCT CCC ATC CCA AAG C . ASO - GQ377 , 5 ′ - GTC CCG CAG TGT CCC AGG CAG AGG C ( Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA , USA ) . Cells were also transfected with a combination of ASO - GQ116 and ASO - GQ377 or with F - MS2 and MCP - GFP alone , to verify that the control oligo had no impact on RNA localization . Six h after transfections , the growth medium was replaced with fresh FA - free medium . A 15 - min FA pulse was given to the cells 24 h after trans - fection , following which they were fixed with formalde - hyde as described above . Cells were then scanned using a confocal microscope and manually counted for cFPGS mRNA localization analysis . Inverted invasion assay Inverted invasion assays were conducted according to the published protocol by McArdle et . al . [ 131 ] . Specifically , on day 10 of FA deprivation , cells were seeded in 24 - well plates . The next day cells were co - transfected with either of the following expression vectors : F - cFPGS & pTurbo - BFP , F - MS2 & pTurbo - GFP , or F - MS2 - dmGQ & pTurbo - RFP . On day 12 , the growth medium containing the transfection reagent was replaced and the cells were allowed to recover for 2 h before they were trypsinized , mixed together , and seeded in three 35 - mm glass - bottom plates ( # 200350 , SPL Life Sciences , Gyeonggi - do , Korea ) . After 4 h , when the cells attached to the plate , the growth medium was removed and cells were overlaid with 150 μl Col hydrogel as follows : Using micropipette tips stored at − 20 o C , we combined on ice RatCol rat tail Type I collagen solution ( # 5153 , Advanced BioMatrix , San Diego , CA , USA ) at a final concentration of 2 . 4 mg / ml , one 10th volume of FA - free 10xRPMI - 1640 medium , 30 mM NaHCO 3 and FBS - containing RPMI - 1640 medium either containing ( one plate ) or lacking FA ( two plates ) ; see Additional file 2 : Figure S5 for the assay design . After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C , when the hydrogels solidi - fied , a thin layer of grease was applied on the rim of each gel to prevent its detachment during the assay . Gels were immersed in growth medium either containing or lacking FA and the plates were incubated for 40 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 at 37°C . The first attempts included a formaldehyde fixation step ; however , even 1 h long fixation did not affect the gel - invading cells , as was seen by the unsuccessful actin staining with phalloidin . Hence , we abandoned fixation and visualized the cells by live fluorescence imaging using an LSM 710 confocal microscope . Content density Cells from the inverted invasion assays were analyzed for content density represented by the fluorescence of the exogenous fluorescent protein they express , i . e . , BFP , GFP , and RFP . For the calculation of fluorescence inten - sity , the cell body was defined as the perinuclear region with the highest fluorescence . If multiple blebs were pre - sent per cell , the bleb with the highest fluorescence was selected for the analysis . The regions of interest , i . e . , cell body and blebs , were marked manually and measured throughout the recorded Z - stacks using the ImageJ soft - ware ( version 1 . 52i , Wayne Rasband National Institute of Health , Washington , DC , USA ) . The fluorescence value is the mean fluorescence recorded in each 3D area . Statistical analyses For the quantification of changes in cell percentage with localized cFPGS mRNA , a two - tailed paired Student t - test was performed . For the number of protrusions per cell and cell content density , a two - tailed two - sample equal variance Student t - test was performed . p values ≤ 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant and are given in the Figure legends and Table 2 .
