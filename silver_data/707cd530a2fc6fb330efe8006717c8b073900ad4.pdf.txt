Methods : Wedownloadedthegeneexpressionpro ﬁ leGSE4290fromtheGeneExpressionOmnibusdatabase , in - cluding 81 gene chips of GBM and 23 gene chips of controls . The t test was used to analyze the DEGs ( differen - tially expressed genes ) between 23 normal and 81 GBM samples . Then some perturbing metabolic pathways , including MAPK ( mitogen - activated protein kinases ) and cell cycle signaling pathway , were extracted from KEGG ( Kyoto EncyclopediaofGenes and Genomes ) pathway database . Cancergenes wereobtainedfromtheda - tabase of Cancer Gene Census . The reversal gene pairs between DEGs and cancer genes were further analyzed in MAPK and cell cycle signaling pathway . Results : A total 8523 DEGs were obtained including 4090 up - regulated and 4433 down - regulated genes . Among them , ras - related protein rab - 13 ( RAB13 ) , neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 10 ( NBPF10 ) and disks large homologue 4 ( DLG4 ) were found to be involved in GBM for the ﬁ rst time . We obtained MAPK and cell cycle signaling pathways from KEGG database . By analyzing perturbing mechanism in these two pathways , we identi ﬁ ed several reversal gene pairs , including NRAS ( neuroblastoma RAS ) and CDK2 ( cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ) , CCND1 ( cyclinD1 ) and FGFR ( ﬁ broblastgrowthfactorreceptor ) . Furtheranalysisshowedthat NRAS and CDK2 were positively related with GBM . However , FGFR2 and CCND1 were negatively related with GBM . Interpretation & conclusions : These ﬁ ndings suggest that newly identi ﬁ ed DEGs and featured reversal gene pairs participated in MAPK and cell cycle signaling pathway may provide a new therapeutic line of approach to GBM . © 2014 Elsevier B .

Itis themostcommontype of braincancer , with ameansurvival timeof only 12 months following diagnosis , and only 2 % of GBM patients sur - vive to 3 years ( Aldape et al . , 2003 ; Ohgaki , 2005 ) . Unfortunately , the exact molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis in the GBM remains unclear . Recently , molecular studies have implicated alterations in different pathways in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas ( Reifenberger and Collins , 2004 ) . Related studies indicate that GBM can frequently carry genetic changes leading to aberrant signaling via the Ras and Akt path - ways , including EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) and PDGFR ( platelet - derived growth factor receptor ) ampli ﬁ cation ( Knobbe and Reifenberger , 2003 ) . Overexpression or altered signaling of growth factors and TGF - β pathway is also a common theme in GBM . TGF - β can deviateupstreamof Smadto activate other mitogenic pathways im - plicated inGBM , includingMAPK ( Ras - Erk ) pathway ( Kanuetal . , 2009 ) . Related genes , including EGFR , VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth fac - tor ) , PDGR and TGF ( transforminggrowth factor ) haveall been implicat - ed in GBM ( Kanu et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , several studies have shown that increased activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) - mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway is correlated with solid tumors ( Lammering , 2005 ; Lammering et al . , 2004 ) . Studies of these signaling pathways have greatly increased our understanding of the biology and clinical behavior of GBM . However , the exact signal - ing mechanisms underlying GBM remains to be elucidated , especially the relationships among pathways .

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Gene journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / gene In this study , we used bioinformatics methods to analyze the gene expression pro ﬁ le of GBM . We aimed to explore the possible perturbing mechanism of GBM from the systematic biology perspective . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Data getting One set of gene expression pro ﬁ les was downloaded from a public functional genomics data repository GEO ( Gene Expression Omnibus : http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / ) database under the accession num - ber GSE4290 ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) , which was based on the Affymetrix GPL570 platform data ( Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2 . 0 Array ) . Total 104 specimens were available including 81 GBM and 23 controls . We downloaded the original CEL ﬁ les as well as the probe annotation of platform . 2 . 2 . Data preprocessing Theprobe - leveldatainCEL ﬁ leswereconvertedintoexpressionpro - ﬁ les and background correction and quartile data normalization were performed by the robust multiarray average ( RMA ) with affy package . For genes corresponding to multiple probe sets which have a plurality of expression values , the gene expression values of those probe sets were averaged . 2 . 3 . Perturbing pathway pairs analysis of GBM The KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) PATHWAY database ( http : / / www . genome . jp / kegg / ) records networks of molecu - larinteractionsinthecells , andvariantsofthemspeci ﬁ ctoparticularor - ganisms ( Kanehisa , 2002 ) . In order to explore the perturbing pathways intheinitiationandprogressionofGBM , weobtainedatotalof249met - abolic pathways from KEGG PATHWAY database . Firstly , the Pearson correlation coef ﬁ cient ( r ) of pair - wised genes in - volved in obtained pathways was calculated in normal and GBM sam - ples . The r was obtained in the following formula ( Adler and Parmryd , 2010 ) : r ¼ X i X i − X (cid:2) (cid:3) Y i − Y (cid:2) (cid:3) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃX i Xi − X (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 s ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃX i Yi − Y (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 s where Xi and Yi were the expression values of paired genes . Afterwards , the difference value ( d - value ) of pair - wised genes in two types of samples was calculated by using the following formula : d = r ( normal ) − r ( GBM ) ( Ma et al . , 2009 ) . We focused on the gene pairs whose relationships were reversed in the progression from nor - mal to GBM , which might play important roles in the progression of GBM . That is , from positive correlation to negative correlation , or from negative correlation to positive correlation . We chose d - value N 1 or b − 1 as cut - off criterion to identify signi ﬁ cant reversal gene pairs . We de ﬁ ned the pathways enriched with reversal gene pairs as perturbing pathways in the progression of GBM . The non - random changes of path - way relationship may contribute to the initiation and progression of GBM . A multivariate permutation test was used to identify perturbing pathways associated with GBM . To evaluate the signi ﬁ cance of each pair of identi ﬁ ed perturbing pathways , the same amount of genes as that of the identi ﬁ ed pathway pair was randomly selected 1000 times by computer from genes in all biological pathways to generate a pair of pathways . Then , the number of reversal gene pairs in the generated pair of pathways was calculated as ( M ) . The frequency of M being larger than the amount of reversal gene pairs in the pair of identi ﬁ ed perturbing pathways was regarded as the signi ﬁ cance P - value . 2 . 4 . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) analysis The t test was used to analyze the DEGs between 23 normal and 81 GBM samples . Genes were regarded to be differentially expressed using cut - off criterion of FDR ( falsediscovery rate ) lessthan 0 . 001 adjusted by the Benjamin and Hochberg ( BH ) method ( Benjamini and Hochberg , 1995 ) . 2 . 5 . Cancer genes data analysis The Cancer Gene Census ( http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / genetics / CGP / Census / ) is anongoingeffort tocatalog those genes for whichmutations have been causally implicated in cancer . In order to analyze the GBM perturbing pathways and the functional network , we downloaded a total of 432 cancer genes from the database of Cancer Gene Census for further pathway analysis . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Recognition of the perturbing pathway pairs in GBM A total of 66 signi ﬁ cantly perturbing sub - pathways were extracted ( p b 0 . 01 ) . After the perturbing pathway analysis , we found that these 66 sub - pathways corresponded to 14 entire pathways : calcium signal - ing pathway , cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) , cell cycle , endocytosis , ErbB signaling pathway , gap junction , MAPK signaling pathway , neuro - active ligand – receptor interaction , oocyte meiosis , phosphatidylinositol signaling system , regulation of actin cytoskeleton , tight junction , Wnt signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway ( Fig . 1 ) . Further analysis suggested that these 14 pathways were closely related to each other . The non - random changes of these pathways may contribute to the ini - tiation and progression of GBM . 3 . 2 . Screening of DEGs We obtained publicly available microarray dataset GSE4290 from GEO database . The t test was used to identity DEGs between 23 controls and 81 GBM . According to threshold criterion ( adjusted p b 0 . 001 ) for DEGs , total 8523 DEGs were obtained including 4090 up - regulated and 4433 down - regulatedgenes . Top 10up - anddown - regulated DEGs sorted by FDR in ascending order were listed in Table 1 . 3 . 3 . Perturbing mechanism of analysis in MAPK signaling pathway and cell cycle It has been demonstrated that essential regulators of cell cycle pro - gression , including cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , cyclins , and CDK inhibitors , have become the major focus of GBM research ( Ng et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , we further analyzed the cell cycle andMAPK signaling pathway ( Fig . 1 ) to explore the mechanism of GBM . MAPK signaling pathway and cell cycle were closely related , and they may be perturbed simultaneously and cooperatively involved in the initiation and pro - gression of GBM . We focused on the relationships between oncogenes and the DEGs in these two pathways ( Table 1 ) . RAS / ERK pathway , as sub - pathways of the MAPK signaling pathway , is animportant pathway in cancer . The relationship between cancer gene RAS in MAPK signaling pathway and CDK2 ( cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ) in cell cycle was reversed from normal to GBM tissue samples ( p = 0 . 04 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Be - sides , the relationships between cancer genes ( CDK6 , CDK4 , CCND1 and CCND2 ) in cell cycle and DEGs ( MAPK11 , FGFR2 , MAPK9 , MAPK10 ) in MAPK signaling pathway were also reversed ( Table 2 ) . 347 W .

Discussion GBM is the most aggressive gliomas , a collection of tumors arising from glia or their precursors within the central nervous system ( Holland , 2000 ) . Although much effort has been made to understand thepathophysiologyofGBM , themolecularmechanismsofgliomagenesis havenot beenclearlyde ﬁ ned . Inthisstudy , weanalyzedthegeneexpres - sionpro ﬁ leofGBMtoinvestigatethekeygenesandpathwaysinvolvedin the mechanism of GBM . A total of 8523 DEGs were identi ﬁ ed between GBM samples and normal samples . Top 10 up - and down - regulated DEGs were selected from identi ﬁ ed DEGs . Ras - related protein Rab - 13 ( RAB13 ) , belongs to the Rab family of small G proteins and takes part in the assembly of tight functions ( Zahraoui et al . , 1994 ) . It has been re - ported that RAB13 was involved in human hepatocellular carcinoma . This study showed that RAB13 was a signi ﬁ cantly up - regulated DEG in GBM , revealing an undescribed role of RAB13 in GBM ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 10 ( NBPF10 ) , which is associated with primate evolution ( Vandepoele et al . , 2005 ) , was found to play a role in GBM for the ﬁ rst time by this current study . PSD - 95 ( postsynaptic density protein 95 ) encoded by gene disks large homologue 4 ( DLG4 ) , the signi ﬁ cantly down - regulated DEG in this study , is a member of the member - associated guanylate kinase family , and participates in anchoring synaptic proteins via binding with other partner proteins including neuroligin and potassium chan - nels ( Han and Kim , 2008 ) . In addition to these DEGs stated above , we found that several rever - sal gene pairs , including NRAS and CDK2 , CCND1 and FGFR , were in - volved in cell cycle and MAPK signaling pathway by analyzing the perturbing mechanism of GBM . Recently , several studies have shown that activation of the Ras - ERK pathway is critical in GBM pathogenesis ( Holland et al . , 2000 ; Momota et al . , 2005 ) . The inhibition of Ras signaling could inhibit glioma growth ( Gömöri et al . , 1999 ) . NRAS , as Ras family gene , has been demonstrated to be activated in glioblastomas ( Knobbe et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , Ras can regulate the activity of small G proteins ( Vojtek and Der , 1998 ) , which participate in cell cycle control ( Hall , 2005 ) . The subdivisions of standard cell cycle include G 1 , S , G 2 and M phases . Furthermore , the transition from one cell cycle phase to another could be regulated by CDKs ( cyclin - dependent kinases ) ( Vermeulen et al . , 2003 ) . Until now , nine CDKs have been identi ﬁ ed and , of these , ﬁ ve are active during the cell cycle . These ﬁ ve CDKs are involved in G 1 ( CDK4 , CDK6 and CDK2 ) , S ( CDK2 ) , G 2 and M phase ( CDK1 ) ( Vermeulen et al . , 2003 ) . CDK2 , as an oncogene , can regulate progression from G1 into S phase ( Ohtsubo et al . , 1995 ) and has been observed to be overexpressed in GBM ( Hodgson et al . , 2009 ) . Based on these evidences , we could infer that NRAS and CDK2 might be involved in the progression of GBM mainly via regulating cell cycle . It has been demonstrated that RAS - MAPK , as a predominant signaling pathway , is generated by activating the downstream of FGFR ( ﬁ broblast growth factor receptor ) . Following FGFR activation , MAPK signaling in - duces cell proliferation , through induction of Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) ( Gatius et al . , 2011 ) . The increased expression of CCND1 can contribute to the loss of cell cycle control in a small fraction of human malignant gliomas ( Büschges et al . , 1999 ) . In some scenarios , FGF activation may have onco - genic roles by increasing cell proliferation and migration . However , in other settings , it may also play tumor - suppressor roles ( Turner and Grose , 2010 ) . Therefore , FGFR2 has been described to play a role as either oncogene or tumor suppressor gene ( Herr et al . , 2010 ) . Yamaguchi et al . have demonstrated that glioblastoma samples exhibit reciprocally low Fig . 1 . The relationships among the 14 signi ﬁ cant perturbing pathways . A pair of pathways enriched with reversal gene pairs was connected by a link . Table 1 Top 10 up - and down - regulated differentially expressed genes .

Li et al . / Gene 547 ( 2014 ) 346 – 350 level of FGFR2 expression ( Yamaguchi et al . , 1994 ) . These reports are in agreement with our ﬁ nding that down - regulated FGFR2 and up - regulated CCND1 were negatively related in GBM samples , whereas thetwogeneswerepositivelyrelatedinthenormalsamples , suggesting that dysregulation of FGFR2 and CCND1 might be one of the multiple causes accounting for the progression of GBM . Besides , Erb B signaling pathway was also a critical perturbing pathway in this study . Its role has been implicated in breast tumor and lung cancer ( Hynes and MacDonald , 2009 ) . In a word , our study revealed important perturbing signaling path - ways and reversal gene pairs related to GBM . Cell cycle and MAPK sig - naling analysis can provide more comprehensive knowledge for gene expression involved in GBM . However , further unraveling of the critical genetic alterations that lead to the initiation and progression of GBM may be necessary for future therapies to work . Additionally , this study has some limitations due to the small sample size . Further studies will recruit more gene pro ﬁ ling datasets to validate the result of this study . However , the signi ﬁ cant result of this study contributed to a better un - derstanding of the mechanism of GBM . 5 . Conclusion Generally , we explored the perturbed mechanism of GBM and found that the relationships of 14 pathways were reversed from normal tissue to GBM . We put emphasis on the relationship between MAPK signaling pathway and cell cycle and found that the relationships of MAPKs and CDKs were changed from normal tissue to GBM . The study suggested that these reversed relationships might play important roles in the ini - tiationand progressionof GBM , providingfurther insight into molecular mechanism of GBM . These previously undescribed DEGs including RAB13 , NBPF10 and DLG4 , and identi ﬁ ed reversal gene pairs , consisting of NRAS and CDK2 , CCND1 and FGFR , could serve as treatment targets for developing novel therapeutic approaches to treat this disease . Further study of the perturbed pathway pairs in our result may help further deepen the understanding of the mechanism of GBM . Authors ' contributions Design the experiments : Wusheng Li .
