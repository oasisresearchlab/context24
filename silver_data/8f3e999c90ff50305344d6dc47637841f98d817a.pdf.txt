For instance , re - cent work calls for expanding approaches to design futuring [ 44 ] , underscores the importance of feminist technoscience for imagining alternative futures with design [ 74 ] , and expanding conceptions of bodies in HCI to include more - than - human concerns [ 42 ] . Design futuring , critical feminist technoscience , and more - than - human concerns garner increasing interest in part because they ofer ways to both resist design solutionism and explore avenues for engaging highly complex , challenging societal problems such as inequality and unsustainability in relation to designing and living with novel technologies . As feminist activists , researchers , designers , and technologists , we see it as urgent to create new forms of situated , plural and collec - tive forms of design futuring . We contribute to this nascent space in HCI by drawing out fabulation as a mode of design futuring that uses speculative storytelling to foreground absent or neglected relations when imagining alternative lifeworlds . Interaction design - ers and HCI researchers have been initiating work to explore how the theoretical concept of fabulation and the practice of fabulating can contribute in design processes [ 40 , 53 , 61 , 67 , 81 ] . Fabulations have some origins in literary criticism [ 72 ] and are gaining traction in feminist Science & Technology Studies ( STS ) as a storytelling approach in response to the Anthropocene [ 33 ] . While we wish to avoid fattening a lively and divergent space of existing work , when we use the term " fabulation " in this paper we mean imagining and creating representations of alternative social relations : ways of designing , ways of knowing , and ways of living with or without technology . Fabulations place less emphasis on designing / imagining technology and more emphasis on social and cultural relations , political tensions , and power hierarchies among human , non - human , environmental and technology co - existence . We argue that fabulation—as both a process and outcome—is par - ticularly interesting to further develop as an approach of future 1693 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . making for a number of reasons . Firstly , fabulations combine think - ing with making , i . e . , in the form of visual , tangible or other material manifestations to communicate stories . Secondly , fabulating is a reciprocal practice that can be done in dialogue with others , such as researchers and practitioners from HCI , design and other disci - plines , thus inviting for collaboratively developing and refecting on imagined futures . Thirdly , fabulations trouble predefned categories , and instead propose new confgurations of human and non - human actors , and include these more - than - human perspectives in the practice of worlding . While we see potential in speculative fabulation methods , we see a need for a deepened articulation of fabulating as an approach that is relevant and generative for design research . In order to address this , in this paper we present and analyze two distinct processes of fabulating conducted by the authors . Each process is focused on a diferent research topic : on bodily fuids [ 40 ] and on biodata [ 81 ] . The fabulation outcomes of each process , in the form of images and collages , are presented in detail in two separate papers elsewhere [ 40 , 81 ] . Here , we focus on the development processes rather than their outcomes . We outline each process and refect on how they are both alike and diferent , teasing out , analyzing , and refecting upon the subjectivities of each project . Bringing the two fabulating processes in dialogue with one another , the analysis surface three themes of what fabulating brings forth as an approach for design futuring . These themes include the materials of fabulations , the shifting temporalities of fabulating , and how fabulation aids in cultivating imagination . We see these as orientations that can guide researchers through a process of fabulating , and aid in articulating the value of fabulation for design practice . We end by discussing how fabulations can work as an ongoing and open - ended material for design , and invite others to fabulate . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Design as Futures - oriented Design involves imagining contexts , actors , and interactions sur - rounding technological artifacts in the future , whether through sketching , scenarios , or prototyping . Fundamentally , traditional human - centered design approaches orient towards the future , at - tempting to move from existing to preferred situations [ 73 ] . Sketch - ing and prototyping allow shape and form to be rehearsed in con - versation with materials , in order to both imagine and create a shared understanding of future possibilities . Design scenarios tell stories of future interactions between personas and not - yet - realized technology designs [ 14 ] . Even functional prototypes are proto , indi - cating their status as frst , early , or provisional [ 62 ] – a frst , basic , or preliminary indicator or desire of what might come to be more fully realized in a / the future [ 49 ] . In these eforts toward a / the preferable future , material and social constraints are accommodated to strive for measurable impact . This idea of the future has also been at the center of futures and foresight studies . By " forecasting " alternative futures , and rep - resenting them as scenarios , they can become a part of strategic planning , infuencing how real - world decision - making processes can work toward implementing preferred futures as part of a " fu - tures cone " [ 15 ] . Strategies here include imagining generic futures to help classify as well as generate and explore greater nuance in ideas about the future [ 12 , 16 ] . Futures studies in this vein can typi - cally engage a community or organization with a Futures Visioning Process to help this group reach consensus on and move toward its preferred future [ 13 , 47 ] . These approaches often frame the future as a feld that contains actors with problems that can be solved by technology , as well as actors who may be directly or indirectly im - pacted by both problem and proposed solution . Futures here often operate as targets , ways of articulating how a problem might be addressed , and work to persuade those involved as to the relevance of the problem and the viability of the proposed solution ( s ) at hand . 2 . 2 Design Futuring Diverging from more traditional design methods , design futuring approaches do not ofer solutions or targets but rather aim to open up critique , discussion , debate , and questioning about alternative futures . We draw from Kozubaev et al . in using the term design futuring to refer to a loose ensemble of approaches that " leverage de - sign to explore futures as a means to comment on—and potentially change—the present " [ 54 , p . 2 ] . For example , the role of speculative design is “not to show how things will be , but to open up a space for discussion” [ 25 ] and the fctional storytelling nature of design fction allows it to be “temporally disinhibited when compared to traditional design” [ 57 , p . 243 ] . While design fctions have been described as objects from a possible future , the approach do not have unifed theories and methods [ 8 ] , but can best described as ex - plorations of the future . Auger articulates that one of the key factors responsible for the engagement of a future vision , in his case via a speculative design , is a bridge between the audience’s perception of their world and the fctional element of the presented concept . He calls this a perceptual bridge , rooting futures in objects that are familiar in the present [ 2 ] . Other design futuring approaches in - clude critical design [ 7 , 23 , 24 ] speculative design [ 2 , 25 ] , discursive design [ 78 ] , and others in this loose ensemble of HCI practices . In contrast to human - centered design , these approaches break away from solutionism and invite questioning or critiquing the status quo . Though not always explicitly referred to by design futuring projects , sociotechnical imaginaries can work as a generative ’back - drop’ to which design futuring approaches respond . Futures here operate as refections of cultural and social understandings of tech - nologies – for better or for worse . Sociotechnical imaginaries are “collectively held , institutionally stabilized , and publicly performed visions of desirable futures , animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through , and sup - portive of , advances in science and technology” [ 46 , p . 4 ] . In a sense , sociotechnical imaginaries synthesize the cultural , societal , political , or institutional norms that design futuring often aims to question , amplify , resist , or subvert . Overall , design futuring approaches work to question or critique the status quo and open up a space for discussion . As design futur - ing practitioners ourselves , we appreciate the strengths of these approaches , yet also acknowledge their limitations . One limitation we have encountered in our own design futuring work is that , by aiming to address an often societally held notion of ’status quo’ , design futuring approaches can risk embedding or reinforcing nor - mative assumptions or viewpoints of dominant groups that have 1694 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA defned or beneft from the status quo , even while attempting to critique and shift that status quo . A growing range of design futur - ing projects seek to mitigate or address this issue , several of which are highlighted in the next subsection . 2 . 2 . 1 Futures for Whom ? There are growing calls for diversifying design futuring and challenging the privileged position of dom - inant speculative design [ 63 ] . For example , with decades of rich precedent works outside HCI , Afrofuturism and Afrofuturist femi - nism and Black feminism have recently been gaining recognition and prominence within HCI as canonical approach ( es ) to design futuring , with much of this work led by Harrington et al . [ 35 ] . Tran O’Leary et al . question who gets to future and point toward possibilities for more participatory futuring with racially diverse and socioeconomically marginalized communities , in their case Africatown in Seattle [ 79 ] . Bardzell calls for moving beyond the typical modernist telos of rationality toward imagining feminist utopias [ 6 ] . Søndergaard contributes ’collective imagining’ as part of the approach for troubling design focused on women’s health [ 74 ] . This draws from STS scholar Donna Haraway’s advice to ’stay with the trouble’ with both feminist and post - anthropocentric per - spectives [ 33 ] . Howell et al . critique ways that the Futures Cone foregrounds a dominant perspective and call for a greater plurality of perspectives on design futuring [ 44 ] . These approaches show a need to continue to diversify and explore approaches to imagining alternative futures . 2 . 3 Fabulation We explore fabulation as one way of imagining alternative futures that helps foreground critical feminist technoscience and post - anthropocentric lenses in HCI an design [ 51 ] . Here we highlight some related approaches to ‘fabulations’ to situate what we mean by fabulations and fabulating . Far from being an exhaustive list of approaches called ‘fabulation’ , we hope that emphasizing a few related works on fabulation from outside HCI can serve to invite other researchers to extend our work on fabulation and continue to connect it to more approaches in fabulating and design futuring . Fabulation in part stems from the narrative form of fables ; sto - ries involving speaking animals and with a strong moral lesson for human behavior [ 68 ] . For instance , we draw from Scholes’ work on fabulation and adapt it for design research . Literary critic Scholes conceptualized in 1960s - 70s fabulation as a new literary mode , that in response to realism turns away from seeking to depict reality , and towards “a more artistic kind of narrative” that stimulates our imaginative well - being through “ethically controlled fantasy” [ 72 ] . Important characteristics of fabulations according to Scholes are the qualities of art and joy ; a pleasure in form ( “extraordinary delight in design” ) that produces joy and peace , and exercises our imag - ination , thereby fnding new ways of corresponding with reality through fction , and new ways of re - imagining human life itself [ 71 ] . Curiously for our understanding of fabulation in HCI and design , Scholes describes the fabulator as a designer of the form of the story : “The fabulator is important to the extent that [ they ] can rejoice and refresh us . And [ their ] ability to pro - duce joy and peace depends on the skill with which [ they ] fabulate . Delight in design , and its concurrent emphasis on the art of the designer , will serve in part to distinguish the art of the fabulator from the work of the novelist or the satirist . Of all narrative forms , fabulation puts the highest premium on art and joy” [ 72 , p . 10 ] . While Scholes’ analysis of fabulation is meant to apply only to literature , the focus on characteristics of joy and art , evocative ideas and ideals , and the relationship between fction and reality , moral , allegory and humor , are important aspects to consider in current constellations of fabulation in feminist STS and design practice . These aspects help characterize fabulations , and later our case studies tease out ways that our fabulating also foregrounds these aspects . A key contemporary theory of fabulation is by Haraway through her fgure of ’SF’ : string fgures , science fact , science fction , specu - lative fabulation , as demonstrated in the Camille Stories [ 33 ] . Har - away emphasizes fabulating as a making of fables , a place of “wild facts” , a worlding which is “often full of animals and full of critters who maybe don’t really exist . Full of children and animals and creatures of the imagination and impossible worlds . But also full of adults , full of the serious” [ 77 ] . Both Haraway [ 33 ] and Despret [ 21 ] have brought speculative fabulation to scientifc discourse to experiment with new ways of understanding more - than - human world - makings . Another key theorist of fabulation is Saidiya Hartman , scholar in African - American literature and cultural history . Hartman’s con - cept critical fabulation [ 36 ] critically engages archival records of Atlantic slavery that record violence enacted against enslaved peo - ple while leaving no trace of the stories of the enslaved people themselves . Refecting on the desire to retell their stories coupled with the impossibility of doing so , Hartman’s critical fabulation of - fers an approach to engaging with histories of violent erasure : " The necessity of trying to represent what we cannot , rather than leading to pessimism or despair must be embraced as the impossibility that conditions our knowledge of the past and animates our desire for a liberated future " [ 36 , p . 13 ] . While the case studies of fabulation that we present in this paper do not directly connect to these lost histories , our fabulations desire and attempt to imagine more equi - table futures . Hartman’s approach of combining critical theory and fction in critical fabulation is crucial for such endeavours . In feminist STS , Kenney [ 50 ] draws from Hartman and Haraway in doing a critical fabulation comparing the crustacean Daphnia to their namesake Daphne in Greek myth . Through this , the pa - per critiques problematic assumptions in epigenetic biology that treat female heterosexual reproduction as an unquestioned good and ofers an alternative reimagining of adaptive biological trans - formation in response to threats . Another example from race and gender studies , is Huerta’s " Magical Habits " where autoethnogra - phy , archive studies and fction are intermingled to contend with racial capitalism and history [ 45 ] . These are examples of how fabu - lation can look to the past , from family archives to mythology , to critically rework both past and present narratives . 2 . 3 . 1 Fabulation in Design and HCI . Design and HCI researchers have recently started drawing on and contributing to fabulation . Design researchers Forlano et al . have been drawn to speculative fabulations as a more politically - minded and norm - critical addition 1695 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . to critical and speculative design [ 26 ] . Here feminist speculative fabulations have been considered to “ofer alternative approaches through attention to core feminist arguments around corporeal - ity , materiality , embodiment , afectivity and experientiality” [ 26 ] . Their perspective on fabulation seeks to ofer new perspectives to design for both speculating on futures and re - imagining the past , through participatory prototyping practices . Jönnson et al . have for instance been inspired by fabulation and the combining of facts and speculations in their participatory design practice , drawing on feminist technoscience , to tell stories and anticipate futures of biodiversity loss [ 48 ] . In a recent conference workshop , Wilde et al . have drawn on design fabulations as “unconstrained futures” that designers can backcast from , to realize social transformation today [ 84 ] . Here fabulations are connected to magical , fantastical and multi - species futures , imagined to create just and sustainable change . Such a commitment to sustainability is also present in ear - lier design approaches of fabulation , such as Mazé’s futures visions of sustainable energy [ 60 ] . In digital civics , speculative fabulation has been used in conjunction with participatory methods to foster embodied and material forms of more than human imaginaries with diferent communities [ 61 ] . In ethnography , speculative fabulation have been used to help with communicating , engaging , and con - necting research materials ( e . g . , texts , feld observations , interview data ) with audiences , mobilizing materials in compelling and af - fectively rich ways to ofer new perspectives around intractable matters of concern such as climate change [ 69 ] . These examples point to how fabulations can foreground embodied , material , and afective imaginaries . From the existing approaches on fabulating presented above , we can understand that fabulations are a form of social fction . It is about imagining alternative social relations , and alternative ways of designing . Thus , the goal with fabulating is not so much to imagine technology , but to imagine social relations and foreground political tensions , absent imaginaries , and power hierarchies . Fabulation does not have to focus on the future . Rather fab - ulation holds a commitment to world - making otherwise includ - ing " a historical reimagining " , where naturalized pasts or presents could be re - imagined [ 66 ] . For example by picking up on forgotten or ignored world - making practices , or non - dominant ( e . g . non - western ) knowledge practices , as extensive practiced and theorized by Daniela Rosner [ 65 ] . Drawing on Hartman , Rosner articulates fabulations as “ways of storytelling that rework how things that we design come into being and what they do in the world . They deconstruct design methods to open diferent understandings of the past that reconfgure the present , creating new opportunities for a just future . Derived from the practice of telling fables or stories , the term fabulation orients design towards narrative potentials” [ 67 , p . 17 ] . Klumbyte et al . [ ˙ 53 ] have integrated critical fabulation , from Black critical theoretical thought and critical and speculative design , into their work with intersectional feminist concepts in ma - chine learning . Critical fabulation , they argue , " entails speculative thought and imagination but it positions those activities against the absent imaginaries and loci of power hierarchies " [ 53 , p . 1530 ] . By bringing together these emerging understanding of fabula - tion , we further explore what fabulation ofers to design practice . Speculative fabulation , inspired by Haraway , can be said to have par - ticular onto - ethico - epistemic commitments , such as a commitment to hybrid fgurations and troubling established ways of knowing . Fabulations are not merely scenarios , design fctions or sci - f futures . They might not have a plot , but can include ethnographic writing . Whereas design fction can be instrumental and product - driven , fabulations have a key connection to and with theory , and fabula - tions can be a way of understanding , working with , and making theory . We build on these expanding and diverse approaches of fabulations , and ofer our own contribution to fabulations in design futuring practices through presenting and discussing two processes of using fabulations as a means to open up design spaces . 3 PROCESS : REFLECTING ON FABULATING This paper emerges as a collaboration aiming to better understand the process of fabulating . With the increasing interest in and refer - ence to fabulation in the design community , we seek to articulate fabulating as an approach in design futuring . We ask what fabula - tion brings to design of futures , and how design futuring practice itself ofers a unique medium for fabulating . By articulating fabulat - ing as an approach , we seek to aid other researchers , practitioners and students in imagining alternative futures . The authors came together as two groups of design researchers that had already separately created fabulations , where each group’s process lasted several months . Our approach of analyzing our own past of design research projects as case studies draws from frst - person approaches in HCI [ 19 ] , where the focus is on the expe - riences and refections of designers themselves . In our case , we reviewed old meeting notes and intermediary design process rep - resentations , and iteratively commented on and discussed our re - fections , adapting these retrospective analysis techniques from Desjardins and Key’s work examining their own past design pro - cesses [ 18 ] and Sanches’ et al . ’s work analyzing the concept of agential realism in their past design research projects [ 70 ] . Through this , we articulated our processes of fabulating , the messy and often emergent [ 28 ] designerly work , in our case of fabulating , that led to the ‘output’ of the fabulations . As a way to refect on the commonalities among our processes but also as a way to tease out and refect upon the subjectivities of each project , we hosted 14 meetings over the course of 8 months , and developed a dynamic collection of notes and collaborative text documents . After an initial kickof meeting , we each contributed a frst round of written personal refections on our role in the respective design project and the personal context in which it took place , as a way to inquire about the meaning these fabulations made in the context of each person’s broader design research practice and personal circumstances . We responded to the following prompts : What were key aspects of the process ? What do we fnd generative in our fabulations ? What is powerful and why ? How do you imagine others using them ? This frst round of refection from the seven authors resulted in about 7000 words in a shared document . We then met to discuss our refections , followed by asynchronously commenting on each other’s refections , and replying to each others’ comments in dialogue . Aiming to further refect and start synthesizing by reacting to each others’ refections , we wrote a second round of individual refections comprising about 3300 words . We continued using the 1696 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA collaborative document for asynchronous discussion . We met to dis - cuss these round two refections and synthesize about 30 extremely rough ’themes’ or aspects describing our processes of fabulation . In future meetings , we gradually narrowed to the themes of the discussion section , iteratively writing , re - writing and adapting one another’s drafts of diferent sections of the paper as a means of refning our thoughts . Through this process , we tease out some pos - sible ways of doing fabulation . We characterize it as an approach , since we do not wish to prescribe a systematic method for fabulat - ing ; rather , we aim to ofer possible avenues , characteristics and elements of fabulating alongside refections on what fabulating can bring to design research . Responding to calls for greater refexivity on the part of the de - signers for design futuring ( e . g . , [ 54 ] ) , we refect on our positionality . We are all positioned within academia as PhD students , postdocs , or faculty at universities in Europe and the US . We are white , cis , hetero , non - disabled women and men from various regions and countries in northern and southern Europe and the US . Several of us have moved to another country for work , where we are not fuent in the local primary language . By fabulating from positions of relative privilege in the global West and North , we acknowledge the limits of our perspectives . Yet , we also aim to leverage this privilege to critique and shift problematic frames in technology development through presenting our fabulations to HCI audiences in academia and industry as well as to our students , many of whom go on to become industry practitioners . In the next two sections , we provide brief overview of a selection of fabulations developed through two design processes : Scaling bodily fuids for utopian fabulation and Biodata futures for living and knowing together . Detailed descriptions of all fabulations , in both written and visual form , can be found in [ 40 , 81 ] . Here , we provide short excerpts of the narratives aiming to transmit the essence of each developed story , followed by refections on the process of creating them . Afterwards , in later sections , we analyze and re - tell the overlapping aspects of these processes , the designers’ thinking and refections , and the similarities and diferences of the fnal visual and textual outcomes . 4 CASE STUDY 1 : SCALING BODILY FLUIDS The fabulations resulting from this process are narratives in the form of fables to think with for the present , instead of futures to strive for or against . In that way , the authors consider them as potentially being situated in a future , or a parallel now , towards other ways of designing and radically being in the world as and with more - than - human bodies . We present two fabulations of text and images ( see Fig . 1 ) . 4 . 0 . 1 Magical discharge rituals : Spiritual bleeding and careful witchcraf . " Human and canine menstruators commune in a gar - den whereby locally grown herbs are used to brew tea particular to a menstrual cycle . In this ritual of care , participants begin their human - food interaction by contributing biodata from a vessel of menstrual blood , a basal thermometer , or a petri dish of saliva . Tools of collection are provided or brought as part of an ecology of menstrual experiences that accom - modates and encourages ‘touching’ . Biodata can be publicly gathered at the table , or privately prepared in advance and then brought . From the biodata , a lunar analyzer draws upon the current phase of the moon to interpret menstrual cycle desires for the personalized crafting of tea . . . " Through this fabulation that imagines radically diferent utopias of gatherings and rituals of human and canine menstruators , the authors pose the following questions , among others : What are the bodily fuids ? Those that are collected or those that are concocted ? And what bodies do these bodily fuids belong to ? Those that touch or those that are touched ? 4 . 0 . 2 Bodily fluid infrastructures : Visible tubes for traveling nour - ishment . “Exposed industrial pipes ebb and fow along a block of modular housing . They pulse in red , yellow , and cream as menstrual blood , urine , and human milk are transported within and from diferent domestic con - tainers . The colors of the moving fuids are also in motion as they shift in hue , saturation , and opacity as a dynamic palette of pipes . From this deliberate exposure , change and variation are visible and no - ticeable . ( . . . ) In one scene , a menstrual cup is emptied . The blood and menses are diluted with water for plant nourishment inside another home while also foating upwards to fertilize a community rooftop garden . In another scene , a catheter of urine freely couples with the structural tubing , which distributes the eferves - cent liquid to sustain vertical gardens and cleanse clothes in a washing machine . Human milk is gener - ously collected in another scene to carefully nurture a kitten and lavishly refresh a man . . . ” Through this fabulation that imagines a network of pipes inside which multiple bodily fuids foat in abundance for interspecies nourishment , the authors pose the following questions : Where else do bodily fuids travel ? What other scenes are out of sight ? What other scenes are ways of knowing ? What else does this fuid infrastructure challenge and maintain ? What else challenges and maintains this fuid infrastructure ? 4 . 1 Developing the Fabulation As the subset of authors who created this fabulation ( Karey , Na - dia , Marie Louise ) , our collaboration began with shared research interests on human bodily fuids ( e . g . urine [ 37 ] , menstrual blood [ 11 , 76 ] , cervical mucus and breast milk [ 38 ] ) , from which we aimed to create visual narratives that could shift social perceptions and values of them . Bodily fuids are essential to human fourishing , yet often excluded from body - centric design methods as they often carry stigma and taboos , and are difcult to categorize as part of the human body or as not part of it . Our conceptual starting point was around notions of queer uses of scales [ 1 ] , multispecies community practices and collaborative survival [ 58 ] , and intimacy in relation to human bodily fuids . Bodily fuids are particularly generative for these themes since they trouble the boundaries of the body , they move beyond the individual human scale , and cross paths 1697 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . Figure 1 : Left image : Magical discharge rituals : Spiritual bleeding and careful witchcraft . Right image : Bodily fuid infrastruc - tures : Visible tubes for traveling nourishment . with others’ bodies and fuids , by means of our intimate individ - ual or community practices ( such as managing menstrual care , or breastfeeding ) , societal norms ( whether or not a fuid has a stigma attached , and to what extent we are willing to share or hide these fuids ) , infrastructures ( public toilets , waste management systems ) or ecosystems ( local ecologies ) [ 29 , 41 , 83 ] . 4 . 1 . 1 Collaboration and Alignment . Prior to our design process , we defned how we wanted to work together . This was important within a shared understanding that we each brought intimate per - sonal experiences and unique empirical knowledge that we wanted to build upon , and also explore interconnections across interests and how those might scale beyond bodily fuids as often associated with a bounded human body . In this way , the practicalities of our collaboration aligned with our conceptual goals . This resulted in outlining the responsibilities of image making , the encouraged leak - ing of visual aesthetics , and the fuidity of individual versus group work through collaborative critiques . We also agreed that a key alignment was a desire for our images to be utopian : we intended for them to be interpreted as visual stories for positive change and to counter dystopian narratives that often aim to critique societal values by portraying bleak future scenarios . Striving for utopianism was a direct response to the challenges we had faced in doing criti - cal work with bodily fuids , including stigma , ethics [ 39 ] , emotion work [ 3 ] , and institutional resistance ; from which we needed a space of joyful allyship and optimism . Thus , we aimed to approach bodily fuids as valuable and abundant , within which we could recognize their particular qualities and potentials in contributing to multispecies fourishing . 4 . 1 . 2 Visual Exploration . For the frst meeting , or design critique , we each brought a collection of aesthetic inspiration and a minimum of fve visual explorations ( See Fig . 2 ) . We printed them out and put them together . Within this frst step , we encouraged the sharing of our personal experiences in designing , researching , and living with human bodily fuids , which primarily focused around menstrual blood , milk , and urine . We did not separate types of lived knowledge , and instead we intended to gather that of which was professionally and personally present . Although we had determined that each collaborator would eventually take the lead on crafting at least one image , in discussing our material we sought to highlight visual and conceptual relations to continue in the visual worlding . For example , Marie Louise brought watercolors of building facades with tubes of menstrual blood and urine down and across them . Karey brought a sketch of pipes connecting various rooms , through which discarded milk could fow from a kitchen to a bathroom sink to a scientifc laboratory . From the watercolors and sketch , we saw an exciting opportunity to foreground nourishment within bodily fuids through making visible how they might travel and be shared within a local community . This cross - pollination of ideas grounded the fnal fabulation Bodily Fluid Infrastructures : Visible Tubes for Traveling Nourishment ( See Fig . 1 ) . 4 . 1 . 3 Visual Narratives . During subsequent critiques , we oriented our conversations around the overarching narrative composition and specifc visual details in our images . We considered how a reader might visually navigate the story ( e . g . as a literary progres - sion from left to right , or through multiple prompts and threads ) and what details already do or might convey the narrative direction ( e . g . atmosphere and context to moments of interaction between humans and nonhumans ) . For example , one of the fabulations that started to take shape , called Spilled Breast Milk , was intended to be read from left to right with a foating milk bank traveling away from climate disaster to a lush paradise , while Bodily Fluid Infras - tructures was intended for a reader to begin from any room and follow the associated pipes to another room ( s ) . In considering the visual elements , we deliberately juxtaposed visual scales to disori - ent perceptions of human bodily fuids as often associated with a singular human body . This was not simply a scaling - up of bodily fuids , but rather making the material itself visible ( as patriarchal societies push bodily fuids out of sight ) and making relations with 1698 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 2 : Left image : For the frst critique session , we brought and printed out images as inspiration for the fabulations . We pinned them up on a board , annotated them and made connections between them . Right image : For the second critique session , we each prepared a frst idea for a fabulation , which we had sketched out or made an initial collage of . We annotated and further developed them together . where fuids go . This created tensions between macro and micro perspectives of bodily fuids to connect more - than - human mate - rial qualities , such as microbial composition , to cross - species and infrastructural pathways of collaborative survival . 4 . 1 . 4 Material Encounters . As we iterated and decided on four key narratives , we refned each image collage further by using own photographic material and drawings , rather than stock imagery . This led us to both search our personal archives of photos and use pictures of our friends , family , loved ones and places and objects known to us , but also to generate new photographs of the material that might be missing . We posed and took pictures of each other and of people around us , took new pictures of objects , environments and materials . The material encounters were abundant through - out this process . We brought materials that had soft cotton pads and embroidery / stitching , and we used watercolors , pen sketches , photographs from home of fuids or associated people and objects , digital inspiration , acetone reliefs , and mixed media . In one specifc instance , Nadia and Marie Louise went into a forest near Nadia’s home with a basket , ready to collect and photo - graph moss , since one of the collages would focus on a wearable moss - underwear garment for collecting menstrual blood , and the practice of making and unmaking it . We touched and identifed diferent mosses , and collected a variety of damp samples to bring back home and photograph . At home , we arranged the mosses and intertwined them with tubes , taking photographs along the way . We also photographed a set of petri dishes , teas , glass containers and other recipients for visualizing another fabulation that was slowly taking shape , that of Magical Discharge Rituals ( See Fig . 1 ) . At one point , Nadia remembered she had saved some of her menstrual blood in a jar in her cupboard in order to take pictures of it or do something with it for this project . She asked Marie Louise about it and they both thought it might look good in photos , but quickly realized it must have been rotting somehow , because it smelled horrible , and was immediately washed down the drain . Nadia refects , somehow , this moment stuck with me , feeling slightly ashamed and embarrassed I had shown my friend something that might be “disgusting” , while we fght so hard to de - stigmatize this in our work . I hadn’t really refected upon this until now , but the un - usual material encounter with this bodily fuid must have pushed our thinking in new directions , because later on we continued fabulating beyond this project , about ways of storing or saving menstrual blood . The resulting images was brought together and digitally edited into the fnal collages . 4 . 1 . 5 Textual Narratives . Finally , Karey crafted text to accompany the collages . The crafting of the textual narratives drew upon notes taken in a shared document documenting the critique sessions . The texts included two descriptions for each image that aligned with the previously mentioned focus on narrative and details . In composing our notes into textual narratives , we aimed for a writing style that would be clearly descriptive of each scene as a story , yet also playful and poetic with words and sentences to express tensions and possible dual meanings to open for a multiplicity of interpretations . We also referenced our more general notes that were not specifc to particular images , such as “what happens of the page ? ” , and refected upon our frequent discussion in designing the fabulations as interconnected or “known” events . This prompted the ending 1699 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . of each textual narrative with a series of open - ended questions to seek possibilities beyond what we might know or expect , and to invite unknowable responses and further speculations . 4 . 1 . 6 Becoming Fabulations . Our utopian commitment infuenced how we positioned the resulting images and subsequent textual narratives as fabulations . During our process we decided that we did not want or intend for them to refect a predetermined timeframe . Instead , we desired for them to be a " mode of attention , a theory of history and a practice of worlding " [ 33 ] . Marie Louise refects : They are not design fctions or speculative designs , but they more curiously work with a material , ( other ) worldly , spiritual storytelling process in which humans , critters , plants and technologies tell stories about themselves , each other , and their past - present - future becomings . Some of the collages and corresponding texts can be read as linear narrative , with a clear storyline , but each of them also has various starting points for other stories to be told . Multiple stories and multiple temporalities co - exist . 4 . 1 . 7 Performative Presentations . With the fnal crafted images and texts together forming a collection of fabulations , we had refections on how to present and possibly perform them . As Karey refects : I started to think about the frst presentation we gave about these fabulations , how reductive it would have been to just “show” and “describe” them , but rather , they needed to be performed . This called for thinking about how and when within the presentation to read them aloud , and the importance of the visual interplay - to make the images dynamic and lively ( we used “bubbles” to highlight aspects being read about to direct the audience through the images ) . In this regard , the outcomes of this fabulating process are not “just” text and images . Their materiality and existence shifts depending upon the audience , medium , and storying intent . 5 CASE STUDY 2 : BIODATA FABULATIONS The second case study imagines biodata as being tightly entangled with more - than - human bodies , including computers as embodied actors , referred to generically as silicon - based agents , as well as non - human critters . In this way , the authors de - center the conception of “biodata” as something calculated only from human bodies , shift - ing towards collaborative co - creation of biodata values between humans and other bodies . Put diferently , only - human biodata is not enough to understand the true meaning and diversity of “bio " . We present two fabulations of text and images ( See Fig . 3 ) . 5 . 0 . 1 Difracting Selves . " When we started growing gardens as a metaphor for design , and attending to ways we are all entan - gled with one another , we started by manipulating things we could see with our naked eye . We started by designing diferent , kinder relationships with the critters around us , such as spiders . But by building collaborations with others , we also have had to know ourselves diferently . What we leave of ourselves in the world as we move through it — a combination of silicon and carbon space — are data doubles , par - tial , contingents , and not always representative of a body in the real world . By spinning stories , weaving diferent threads around the web , we imagine bodies as having control of their traces , leaving wakes that are crafted to wash over records . ( . . . ) First , as with the tattoos of the past , some of us dared to wear the silicon agents on our skins . ( . . . ) They are organic and silicon - based and move with our bodies , pulsating with our veins , infating and defating with our lungs , twisting , turning in tandem with our own rhythms . ( . . . ) ( Such ) implants also cause interference with us and others around us . We are as much afected by our own implants as by the implants of those around us , by the wind as it caresses our skin , or the loud horn of a car passing nearby . Each rhythm , each wave , difracts with one another , afecting us while we afect everything around us . It’s impossible to know what anyone is “truly” feeling , not when we are constantly afected by the waves of those around us . ” This fabulation resists the prevalent push to ‘discover’ the ‘truth’ , whether scientifc or internal and subjective , of bodies through biodata . Rather than inner or outer truth , there is only interference and difraction [ 4 , 5 ] . It poses the questions : What are the bodies being sensed ? Is a “body” a material body or an accumulation of its data traces ? How many bodies or data doubles exist out there ? Can data doubles help in forging alliances with other bodies , both human and non - human ? 5 . 0 . 2 Collective Afect . " This carpet is composed of thousands of semi - alive flaments that are able to collect tears , resonate with the excitement of new love or stomps of anger , and senses the disquieting , somber reminiscence of those who sit , contemplate and struggle to let it all out . With every laugh , commemoration , or moment of sorrow , the multitudes of flaments hum , resembling a cat’s purr that grows deeper and more complex . When they are frst planted , the flaments are small and still , but as they collect the traces of grief of many , they respond to it through vibration and humming , growing in height and activity over days , weeks , years or however long the grief is felt . . . ” This fabulation questions the scale of biodata across multiple dimensions , both in terms of individual bodies as well as how those bodies relate to one another , as a thread that weaves together hu - man and non - human bodies as members of a biodata public . A biodata public imagines biodata that participates in and attends to community - level issues . Through this fabulation , we pose the questions : How can biodata , being always political , support com - munities of shared practices and policy ? How can we expand the notion of biodata to understand a healthy community as a biome for living with ? 5 . 1 Developing the Fabulation In this case study , fabulations became a way of engaging with re - search fndings . This process took a distinct form from the previous case study , and unfolded almost a year later . It began as a follow - up step of a workshop focused on identifying challenges and oppor - tunities when designing with biodata , described in [ 80 ] . From this 1700 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 3 : Left image : Difracting Selves . Right image : Collective Afect . workshop , we ( Vasiliki , Noura , Tom and Pedro ) , the authors in - volved in this fabulation process , identifed emerging themes for biodata design future research : pushing the boundaries of what counts as biodata and bodies , attending to a greater diversity of human bodies and experiences , and scafolding biodata collabora - tions between human and Other ( non - human ) bodies . These themes emerged from the analysis of the workshop material , as well as further discussions and refections on the future of biodata design research that continued for about a year after the workshop . As a next step , we wanted to continue exploring and refecting on how biodata have biopolitical implications and how we can imagine alternative biodata design futures , using ideas of scale , collabora - tion and crafting diferent measures , presented in the published paper including the fabulations on Scaling bodily fuids ( i . e . , " Case Study 1 " ) . The three themes of biodata design research that we used as a starting point had already a theoretical commitment to feminist perspectives and post - anthropocentrism , so we engaged in this topic and process thinking through and with human and non - human bodies . 5 . 1 . 1 Telling Biodata Stories . Two authors ( Tom and Vasiliki ) met in the beginning of Autumn 2021 . We drew directly from the fabu - lation approach of Scaling bodily fuids as a starting point . For us scale , collaboration and crafting diferent measures , became lenses on our own work . As Tom describes , " The fndings and themes [ from the workshop ] were compelling to me , but they seemed like they needed a way to make them become compelling to others . Using them as the launching pad for stories to tell about the possibilities of bio - data seemed like a reasonable next step – we could think about how the themes could be focused by diferent lenses related to our own research . How could biodata be made precious ? Be shared in a com - munity ? Become an object of refection ? Imagining worlds that the biodata could build and telling stories of new arrangements and forms that biodata could take seemed like a way to help the ideas travel . " Because we were operating partially remotely and internationally , we used Miro to on the three themes from the workshops ( See Fig . 4 ) : pushing the boundaries of what counts as biodata , encountering a plurality of bodies , and more - than - human biodata ) from a perspec - tive of broadening in each what counts as “bio , ” “data” and “bodies” , since these themes were troubling each of these , in diferent ways . By mapping out diferent concepts and words that came to mind , three design spaces started to take form : 1 ) Nurturing biodata for collaborative survival , 2 ) Difractive data doubles , 3 ) Cohabitating in biodata publics . These encompassed aspects of scale , collabora - tion and human - non / human relations , while also drawing on our own backgrounds , research trajectories , and interests . Tom and Vasiliki gathered images from online resources that resonated with these design spaces . They started combining and connecting images to each concept , while writing short stories about these worlds with a focus on biodata futures . What is bio , what is body , what is collaboration there ? What entanglements and relationships exist between humans and non - humans ? How can biodata contribute to new ways of knowing and cohabiting instead of prioritizing human knowledge , well - being and existence ? Short snippets of stories were written for each design concept in Miro , under preliminary images combined and annotated with a few words . Presenting , to the other researchers involved in co - organizing the initial biodata workshop , this exploratory direction of moving from the themes to developing stories , we all agreed that a way for new collaborators ( Pedro , Laurens , and Noura ) to 1701 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . Figure 4 : Left image : A Miro board became home to an iterative process of idea refnement and generation . Here we show an initial step where the three themes were interpreted through gathering and collating inspirational images . Later , this board was expanded with notes and short stories . Right image : Detail on the initial prompt and frst drafting of a fabulation story . enter this process would be to respond to and continue developing these preliminary stories . They began by annotating the stories in Miro , based on what thoughts , feelings or new concepts the stories evoked to them . 5 . 1 . 2 Developing a Broader Vision . As a continuation to this pro - cess , all researchers / authors involved in this case study began by fnding current media stories , scientifc articles and a variety of imagery that related to the snippets of text and stories that had been developed . For example , articles about how spiders ( i . e . , non - human bodies ) sense the world and how sensitive they are to human dis - turbances , the symbolism of spiders across diferent cultures , how computation can be made from natural materials , how fungi can be weaved into burial suits to facilitate decomposition , or how patterns of laser difraction can create strong aesthetic experiences . These materials gave rise to new text snippets that remixed themes of the older ones with both current events and mythologies . The intention was to create a rich and complex world that could be related to and perceived as “just around the corner” . As Pedro refects : " “This process continued over the course of weeks and months , as each new person commented and added to the fabulations , connecting them to new stories . Some of these new stories were scientifc studies , while others were science fction , resulting on re - writing the fabulations to incorporate the new stories and points - of - view . The whole process was really string fguring . It was a step by step un - making and re - making what was there , by making new fgures out of the old ones . And the current stage of the fabulation is just that : their current stage . To me , this process is far from being complete . ” In this version we took inspiration from Rosner’s critical fabula - tions , where it is advised that we take into consideration lost and forgotten modes of production and labour for computation [ 67 ] . Searching for these , we refected on what is biodata replacing as a mode of knowledge production , of understanding ourselves and the world . This research was infuenced by current readings in the intersections of botany and indigenous knowledge [ 52 ] , as well as science fction that explored the notion of communicating across species with only partial understanding [ 59 ] . These infuences gave rise to the idea that biodata could be conceived as any form of inscription in the world , not to be decoded as information , but to be aesthetically appreciated both among humans and between species . In search for a metaphor for designing , we found that permaculture and gardening , which are active doings of diferent species , and require from humans some knowledge of the ecological entangle - ments between diferent species , could be a fruitful form of thinking about biodata design . We wrote a prologue to capture these aspects of how a way of knowing life and the more - than - human world could be made from hybridizing traditional knowledge and new technologies , describing a new actor called “silicon - agents” – fgurations of biodata commu - nication devices for more - than - human worlds . These think beyond artifcial intelligence , which is centered on individual technologies , towards more - than - human intelligence , centered on emerging prop - erties of a broader ecology . The second version of the fabulations was written , fguring these machines and ways that they could be hybridized and woven into collaborations in the more - than - human biological world . 1702 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA 5 . 1 . 3 Keeping a Critical Perspective . This version of stories was then iterated with other co - authors . In particular , Noura tried to make sure that future readers of these fabulations would interpret them in ways that challenged their dominant perception of bio - data . As she refects : I tried to add greater criticality , holding space for diference without fattening diference . I did this through minor textual edits and comments . I tried to imagine how others might read the fabulations , interpret them , and imagine ways of knowing with biodata from these fabulations . Sometimes readers’ interpretations diverge from authors’ intentions . I tried to make sure that future read - ers of these fabulations couldn’t go away defaulting to old patterns of exclusion that too easily get embedded in working with biodata . ” Aiming to keep a critical lens , we focused on alternative prior - ities and values and amplifying those ideas . For example , in the frst fabulation developed , Weaving Alongside , we worked during the design process with questions such as " how can spiders coexist with their webs alongside humans , but without centering the hu - mans and human interests or hiding spiders away in ’cocoons ? ’ " Questions like these were permeated with Latimer’s notion of " be - ing alongside " [ 56 ] . In the second fabulation , Difracting Selves , we focused on the concept of ’data doubles’ . With this concept came questions about the social performativity of the representations , and the possibility for supporting or resisting surveillance with them , hereby bringing in two critical interests in biodata around social performativity and oppressive surveillance . Finally , with the third fabulation , Collective Afect , the concept was pushed beyond playful and refective uses toward more radical and emancipatory ideas of community solidarity , assisting collective grief and rage as well as softer , gentler , or more pleasant emotions . 5 . 1 . 4 Illustrating the Fabulations . After this process , the fabula - tion stories were textually very rich . But there were also materially dense , meaning that they were accompanied by a form of imagery that evoked sensory qualities of the stories – their feelings , colours , textures , and movements . The text of the stories evoked sensory qualities , suggesting a variety of visual interpretations . When we developed our stories , we aimed for the fabulations to be materially rich . We also discussed how to further develop them visually , cre - ating imagery to accompany each story that would be suggestive of the content . We thought about developing collages—diferent parts of things being combined and intertwined . We did not want these visual parts of the fabulations to be too literal and prescrip - tive of the worlds we imagined , as we felt that they should both complement the stories and remain open to being interpreted in new ways , adapted and reimagined by others . Vasiliki has a friend who is an illustrator and animator , and her work has an atmosphere that fts the biodata world we were imagining well . This illustrator read the stories we had written , and gathered textures and photos of physical things and materials that she could use for the illustrations . We highlighted key terms and phrases in the stories that seemed to refect the essence of the ideas , and gave these to her to work with . Vasiliki met twice with the illustrator to explain the context of our collaboration and to make sure that she understood the fabulations . We also had a series of meetings with the entire group , where she showed preliminary collage ideas for further development and refning based on our discussions and feedback . These illustrations created new layers in the fabulations , and brought a new understanding and interpretation of the stories that complement the written text . In our discussions and analysis of the fabulations , we focused on how they can be further materialized into intricate and polyvocal narratives . In doing so , we have also delved deeper into particular elements of each story , questioning why they are as they are , or how they might have been diferent . Some examples here include the element of “dancing” as a mutual relationship between humans and critters ( in particular spiders ) , or a decision to eliminate the black colour in the afect carpet , since we wanted all kinds of emotions being communicated and shared in this context . The details of the illustrations point to details of the stories . One is invited to spend time reading the stories and viewing the illustrations , and speculate on how the elements living in those worlds are entangled together . After we were done , we felt that this process of fabulation added something meaningful to our design experience , creating visions that others could build upon as we had . Vasiliki describes the pro - cess and goals like this : " Developing the fabulations collaboratively was a very powerful process . It was not only that the fabulations were aimed at addressing scale , collaboration and crafting diferent measures , but it was also the process of developing the fabulations itself that moved across these . We brought together our theoretical commitments , things we have read that inspired us , and ways that we think about the world and this particular context we were focusing on . And we weaved all these collaboratively into fabulations that have some aspects of all of us , as individuals , but which share our common worries , desires , concerns and future hopes . ” 6 QUALITIES OF FABULATION Analyzing and refecting on the two processes of fabulating , we have drawn out some broad characteristics or qualities that fabulations have , both as a process of creating worlds ( i . e . , fabulating ) and as an outcome of those processes ( i . e . , the fabulations themselves ) . These include the materials of fabulations , the shifting temporalities of fabulating , and how fabulations aid in cultivating imaginations . We see these as generative orientations that can guide designers and researchers through a process of fabulating , and as analytical qualities that can be used to interpret fabulations . 6 . 1 The Materials and Making of Fabulations In each case study , we began our processes by sharing lived experi - ences in designing and researching bodies , biosensors , and bodily fuids in workshops as well as ongoing meetings . Both cases also started with the authors collecting images , photos , and illustrations that served as aesthetic inspiration for the fabulations . However , after this step in the process , the two cases diverged . The bodily fuids case study departed from visual explorations towards visual narratives , depicting diferent visual scales to disori - ent perceptions and create tensions . This process relied on using craft materials ( paper , threads , painting , textile , collage , cutting ) to portray future worlds , including what products , practices , and built environments might exist . After a few iterations of crafting the visual fabulations , we decided on the fnal versions , and only after this step , the accompanying text was crafted . In this case , working with these materials was an emergent process that led 1703 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . to particular ways of reimagining engagements with bodily fuids . The combination of these materials evolved into writing the texts and producing the images . For the biodata case study , while visual material informed discussion , the process of developing the fabula - tions was more textual . The practice of developing the stories and editing texts was taken on by each of the authors in turn , adding their own sensibility and sense of meaning into them . Only after the stories were refned to say what we believed we meant , were illustrations produced . These brought new depth to thinking and served to create a richer representation of the fabulations . What shape could fabulations have ? In both cases , we present them as a combination of text and images , meant to be read and experienced simultaneously . With the bodily fuids case study , the production of visual images came before writing the text , whereas for the biodata case study writing the text came before produc - ing the images . While our fabulations are all combinations of text and image , we see that the order of producing these are of less importance – they can be produced in parallel and will inevitably infuence each other in the process . The bodily fuids fabulations have been presented performatively and poetically during talks . There can be other ways to present them , and as such fabulations can be seen as unfnished , prone to being adapted and communi - cated to diferent audiences . They could be exhibited like a painting in a gallery , without a lengthy description , without the text , and be left purposely ambiguous and up for interpretation , or they can be accompanied by the author’s storytelling by performing them : presenting them in an engaging way , asking audience to attend to specifc details , reciting the narratives , and allowing time for the audience to read them on their own . Both cases engaged with more - than - human and relational ways of knowing and foregrounded absent imaginaries of bodies and technology . While both cases engage with scale , they do not con - sider scaling ( up ) as an inherent good and recognize the harm that capitalist logics of scaling and growth can bring to social justice [ 55 , 82 ] , where the expansion of storytelling itself can be problem - atic [ 30 ] . For instance while Spilled Breast Milk scales up breast milk , Community Menstruation Practices Practices is scaling down compared with industrial menstrual hygiene product systems . By working with " conficting scales that might be disorienting , or queer scales " [ 40 ] , the cases demonstrate how fabulations can craft difer - ent measures in fantastical worlds that foreground certain aspects while minimizing others ; thinking beyond the singular human body and human exceptionalism but embracing our more - than - human relationality and locality . 6 . 1 . 1 Joy in Fabulating . According to Scholes , there is an extraordi - nary delight and pleasure in the form and design of fabulations [ 71 ] . We experienced this delight and pleasure in writing the narratives and producing the images , and aimed to transfer this joy in text and image to an audience . In the case of bodily fuids , the authors chose a utopian and joyful attitude to the often stigmatized subject of bodily fuids , and they also found a cathartic joy in the collaboration itself . Likewise , for the biodata fabulations there was satisfaction in producing the representations that could help to make research ideas material in provocative ways . We refect on the sustenance ofered by joy . As women working against the stigmatization of menses and breast milk in traditional STEM contexts , there is a toll of emotional labor [ 3 ] . The rise of dehumanizing , criminalizing bio - data surveillance can at times seem overwhelming large , powerful , and difcult to resist . The fabulations intentionally contrast this discouragement to sustain hope in imagining alternatives . Both of these cases are examples of why joy is needed in keeping up the energy to keep doing work that resists and challenges the dominant , and we argue fabulation as an approach aids in this joy . In the making of imaginative worlds in the form of texts and visual imagery , this joy of fabulating can become accentuated in the connections between materiality and imagination . Playing with unrealistic scales and ambiguous abstractions in the images , and with poetic narratives in the text , allowed for a more imaginary approach to world - making , where the constant tension between the familiar / mundane and the spectacular / fantastical prompted us to radically reimagine what could be . Materials for fabulation can come from any number of media , and text and images can be a starting point for further material explorations . But what is important for an approach of fabulating in interaction design and HCI is the material aspect beyond written narratives themselves : highlighting designers’ and creative practitioners’ ability to imagine how things ( technologies , artefacts , systems ) have concrete material impact in possible future worlds , using their designerly skills to make , craft and materialise these fabulations into some perceivable or a sensory medium . 6 . 1 . 2 Materiality as Part of a Critical Method . Just as science facts and archival data can form the basis of fabulating , so can frst - person [ 20 ] , lived experiences become material in a fabulation process . As a form of storytelling , speculative fabulations , have been used in other related disciplines and practices ( Section 2 . 3 ) to ofer novel ontological , epistemological and ethical perspectives . In both of the cases presented in this paper , the process of fabu - lating stems from a deep engagement with how bodies have been approached in our own design practice , from frst - person perspec - tives , as datafed ( biodata ) and stigmatized ( bodily fuids ) . These refexive frst - person engagements integrated experiences and ma - terials from the authors’ lives into the fabulations . These understandings of the values surrounding bodies in design— and how we want to challenge them—stems not only from engaging with materials such as diferent technologies , but also with design research literature , feminist new materialism , queer theory , and STS literature that ofer conceptual and theoretical pathways to crit - ically re - imagine norms and assumptions towards alternative ways for these materials to be integrated into everyday life , helping them to be designed otherwise . The fabulations that we produced are crafted specifcally to combine critical perspectives with material knowledge : drawing from our past expertise working with bodily fuids and biodata , we shaped plausible but alternative worlds to imagine how to engage with biodata and bodily fuids diferently . This combination of theory and making distinguishes itself from other approaches by focusing not on objects and gadgets , but on world - making involving future perspectives . 6 . 2 Shifting Temporalities of Pasts , Presents , Futures Engaging in a process of fabulating can be a way to refect on temporalities pertaining to a specifc research topic . Similar to 1704 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA other methods of futuring that shift the focus from the present to a projected future , such as speculative design or design fction , fabulations invite both the makers of the fables and the audience engaging with those to refect on aspects of time . Unlike these other design futuring methods , however , fabulations as not intended to exist only in the future . The alternative imagined lifeworlds they ofer could be located in a past , present , or future ; at all these times simultaneously ; or moving in between them . For instance , Rosner’s fabulations bring untold pasts into the present [ 67 ] , and Wilde et al . use fabulations as futures that are backcasted into the present [ 84 ] . In our cases , the time in which the biodata - focused fabula - tions take place is not concretely - defned . They can be imagined as existing in the past , present and future ; or as extending from the past to the present and then into the future . Fabulations as narratives are also not necessarily linear : for instance , " Commu - nity Menstruation Practices " describes intergenerational cycles of gathering and redistributing moss , while " Magical Discharge Ritu - als " describes a regular social meeting of drinking tea and sharing discharge samples . Beyond troubling the linearity of time and the multiple tem - poralities during which a fabulation can take place , our fabulat - ing processes have also prompted refection on how one could de - center human perception of time through storytelling . This is an aspect that is less prevalent in the presentation of our fabulations , but which was nevertheless part of the discussions taking place throughout the processes of developing the fabulations by both of the two groups . The timescales in our designed fabulations are not necessarily human . They range from a few moments’ duration to describing a general societal transition in " Entangled Biodata World " . Additionally , the narrative structures of our fabulations often do not feature specifc human characters , personas , or pro - tagonists . Rather they tend to describe social rituals ( e . g . , " Magical Discharge Rituals " ) or public practices ( e . g . , " Collective Afect " ) . Similarly , in the " Weaving Alongside " fabulation , where spiders co - exist with humans , temporalities and time can be refected through the spider’s perspective ; questioning how this story might change from a spider’s experience of time ? Beyond troubling temporalities and time through the fabulations themselves , the actual process of fabulating was a process of entan - gled temporalities . Both processes presented highlighted aspects of re - mixing or string - fguring [ 31 ] , where one researcher was picking up a thread of another one , and then adding something to it . This was a non - linear experience of creating the fabulations , which did not have a clear beginning and a clear end . Further , we consider the developed fabulations as not “fnished” or “done” but we rather as open - ended narratives that can continue to be evolved by us , or by others who want to pick them up and continue developing these worlds , creating e . g . , illustrations , short flms , models , or pro - totypes . Our experience of making these fabulations is more in line with a process of working with multiple threads that connect , unravel , and re - connect . As a process , developing the fabulations also took time . The work was slow and refective , individual but also collaborative . We gave the fabulations time to marinate , itera - tively developing concepts , bringing in inspiration , and engaging in embodied activities . Overall , we see fabulation as ofering an approach for both en - gaging with , as well as troubling , notions of time and temporality in relation to technological developments making openings to ac - knowledge diferent forms of knowledge e . g . , Indigenous knowl - edge . It does this by working with cyclical concepts of time , such as phenology , or with long - term thinking , such as intergenerational living . By weaving together multiple timespans and temporalities into a fabulation , we are invited to make our own temporal connec - tions among elements of a story as we read the story and visuals that accompany it . This is in line with Kozubaev et al . ’s [ 54 ] in - vitation to engage with temporal representations as a refective mode in design futuring . Similarly , when fabulating , one can en - gage with various temporal questions : " how does the fabulation represent time , and why ? " , " Who is included in this time represen - tation and timespan , and who is excluded ? " . We do not suggest that fabulation must follow these tendencies in terms of engaging with temporality and time . But these choices on how to present imagined lifeworlds through fabulation afect what social , cultural practices and rhythms are foregrounded . In fabulation , temporalities are of - ten left under - specifed , rather than representing a particular point in the future , and describe practices that can happen repeatedly like social rituals or gatherings or commonplace encounters in public space . We see this as an opportunity to attend to both human and non - human , individual and collective , multilayered and entangled temporalities of pasts , presents and futures , in a non - linear and open - ended format . While previous work on fabulations in design and HCI has em - phasised reimagining pasts ( histories ) [ 67 ] , the reason why we still emphasise fabulation as an approach that orient towards futures , is , frstly , that we consider fabulation as providing a criticality urgently needed for other design futuring work , such as speculative design , design fction and strategic foresight , and secondly , that challenges of climate crisis and social injustices require long - term thinking and sometimes an imaginative leap that the space of the future can provide . That said , fabulations is not only about the future , and there are indeed limitations to working with the future , as it can oversimplify the present and invisibilize current issues and lived re - alities faced by certain communities [ 64 ] . As an approach in design futuring , we argue that fabulation ofers a shift in temporalities across pasts , presents and futures , by troubling linear narratives and a human temporal stance . 6 . 3 Cultivating Imagination : Honing in on Fabulation Refecting on our own processes of fabulating , we recall how fabu - lating helped cultivate our imaginations individually and as a team to sustain a sense of critical hope , abundance , and joy , even as our work was motivated by deep critiques of our domains . For exam - ple , in the case of the biodata fabulations , we started from rather broad ideas of how we can engage Others in processes of making interpretations of biodata readings , or how to think about biodata futures from a broader scope that would contribute to cultivating ecological sensibilities . Through slowly developing stories—both in - dividually and collectively—and through connecting threads of one another’s stories , our imaginations gradually opened up . Slowly , we started considering and including details in the fabulations that we would not have thought of when we had initially entered this 1705 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Søndergaard et al . process . For example we started engaging more deeply with spi - ders as Others and considered how a relationship of fear between humans and spiders could be turned into a mutual relationship of care and collaboration , supported by empathic knowledge gained from the spiders’ and the humans’ biodata readings . As design researchers , we utilize many techniques for generating ideas and broadening our imaginations , ranging from brainstorm - ing and bodystorming techniques , to other speculative or critical methods that more explicitly aim to invite people to open up their imagination and correspondingly , a design space . Our case studies illustrate that fabulation can contribute to cultivating imagination for design researchers . Typical design processes can tend toward techno - solutionist and short - term aims that seek to ft within and incrementally shift the world as it is now . When surrounded by this kind of work , it can be challenging to carve out space—space in time , headspace , physical space , and priority—for imagining far into the future with radically alternative social norms and ritu - als . When aiming to resist the stigmatization of bodily fuids and the oppressive regulation of bodies , incl . women , non - binary and trans folks , it can be challenging to imagine hopeful alternative possibilities . When aiming to resist and reconfgure biodata , it can be challenging to imagine hopeful possibilities outside legacies of neoliberal self - improvement and oppressive surveillance . Our processes of fabulating helped us do design work based in our com - mitment to critical feminist technoscience , resisting the issues of our respective domains , while at the same time imagine hopeful critical alternatives . Fabulating here is a crucial driver for resisting and critiquing the defuturing of technology [ 27 ] , and continuing advocating for and practicing the important life - sustaining collec - tive force of our imagination . Fabulations are not blunt of their own wickedness and at times strange ( im ) possibilities . Fabulation as a design futuring approach brings an alternative to other speculative work which have been adapted and appropriated into foresight , trendspotting and strategy , where predictability and probability are valued higher than the expansive space of the possible . We argue that in critical times where our futures are uncertain , it is increas - ingly important that designers cultivate and train their imagination . As an aspiring approach in need for development , fabulation ofers radical new ways of ideating and conceptualizing futures , where the fctitious and fabulous space of more - than - human worldings are deeply connected with a feminist commitment to challenge social structures and power hierarchies among human , more - than - human and technological co - existence . 7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE ( S ) WORK 7 . 1 Fabulations as an Ongoing and Open - ended Material for Design Fabulations can be useful both as the creative process of imagining and as the materialisation or form - giving of imaginings . After initial research into a domain or topic has been conducted , fabulations work to open up and extrapolate the design space , revisiting values and questioning initial assumptions of research and corresponding design directions . Fabulations can work as ends in themselves , as objects of refections and debate , as with the case studies in this paper . Yet they can also function as future visions for further design work to continue and build on the fabulations . For instance , two of the authors continued their fabulations of Scaling Bodily Fluids into the research - through - design project Biomenstrual [ 10 , 75 ] . We highlight opportunities for designers to take up fabulations created by themselves or others , and further explore and develop the fabulations through other design research methods such as creating concrete artefacts , interactive systems , or technologies portrayed in the fabulations . Refecting on the ongoing - ness of and open - endedness of fabu - lation , we consider fabulation as an approach that embraces emer - gence in design research practice , drawing from Gaver et al . [ 28 ] . While the outputs of the fabulations can set intentions for future work , we also observe how our processes of fabulating embraced ac - cidental occurrences as pivotal sources of inspiration . For example , when one author working on the Scaling Bodily Fluids fabulations felt embarrassed to discover that the menses she had saved for use as a design material had unexpectedly turned rotten , this became fertile conceptual material for refection on the stigmatization of bodily fuids – an emergence strategy to “consider anomalies to be inspirations” [ 28 , p . 522 ] . In narrating our processes of fabulating in this paper , we avoid defning a strict method for fabulation be - cause we want to “present design research as a journey , not a quest” [ 28 , p . 523 ] to support the emergence of diverse and unexpected reimaginings through fabulating . In this way of presenting design research , we articulate a nuanced and sometimes messy retelling of process that responds to calls to tell richer , less glossy stories of design research processes [ 43 ] . 7 . 2 Inviting Others to Fabulate The fabulations presented in this paper were created by academic design / HCI practitioners through a frst - person approach without direct feedback from an audience , users or in collaboration with a community . To broadening perspectives in / on fabulating , there is a need to explore how we can invite others to fabulate , acknowledge the ways people are already fabulating ; and questioning fabulations for whom ? Such invitations could include design pedagogy with students [ 66 ] , participatory design with end - users , or with practi - tioners in workshops and broader design projects that have indus - trial and societal impact . This is not only to understand how more people in practice can collaborate on fabulating . More important for this collaborative approach would be to ensure that fabulation does not become an academic - only practice , and also that diversity and plurality are built into fabulating practice . For this , there is a need to understand how participatory and inclusive practices can be stimulated by fabulation , engaging with marginalized experiences , forgotten pasts , and neglected or absent realities . At the same time , we acknowledge that particular materials and activities ( e . g . , collage in our case ) and sometimes playful , utopian , or joyful tone of our particular fabulations could be an inappropriate way of engaging particular audiences , especially for participatory engagements with communities reckoning with systemic oppression and trauma [ 34 ] . Harrington et al . describe these risks in ofering considerations for more equitable and participatory design engagements [ 34 ] . Fabu - lating may not always be the right choice of approach , and it must be adopted and adapted carefully to set an appropriate , respectful emotional tone with participants and audiences . 1706 Fabulation as an Approach for Design Futuring DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA While we have been inspired by other disciplines’ work on fabu - lation , including the literary genre [ 71 ] , futures studies and STS [ 33 ] , we fnd that emerging practices of fabulation in design and HCI ofer creative and tangible approaches of engaging with speculative fabu - lations in ways that are sensitive and critical to the roles technology ( could ) play . We invite for further interdisciplinary collaborations on fabulation , deepening the literary and narrative potentials of design fabulation ( similar to [ 9 , 17 ] ) , and exploring how fabulation may work alongside other sense - making and imagination tools in futures studies , such as the futures wheel and the 2x2 scenario matrix . Additionally , we see fertile potential for further uptake and adaptation of fabulations in design industry , beyond academia and theory - driven disciplines such as HCI , the humanities , and social science . Taking caution from Wong and Khovanskaya’s analysis of speculative design’s rhetorical engagement with industry over the past few decades [ 85 ] , future work on fabulation can explore how fabulations might work toward , as Wong and Khovanskaya call for , a criticality based in “advanc [ ing ] agendas that challenge dominant practices in technology design” [ 85 , 175 ] . How might fabulations engage , shift , and resist industry rhetoric , through fab - ulations’ emphasis on thriving lifeworlds and diverse perspectives ? We see potential for fabulation to work alongside other critical futures - oriented approaches in design industry , such as design fc - tion [ 8 ] , adding onto the role that objects and diagetic prototypes play in envisioning futures , to incorporate wider fabulating world - building activities that foreground absent imaginaries . Building on how speculative fabulations intermingle science fact and science fction [ 32 ] , we invite for future work that explore how fabulation can be used in public dissemination of science and for heightening public engagement with science projects . Sometimes , or perhaps too often , futures extrapolate dominant sociotechnical imaginaries toward either utopian or dystopian ex - tremes , often inspired by Western science fction [ 22 ] . While this can provoke refection and debate , it can also reinforce an existing dominant techno - narrative as an inevitable , inexorable premise or starting point from which to extrapolate . Yet , as recent work in design futuring increasingly acknowledges , there is no singular point in the present from which we can point a ‘futures cone’ out - ward [ 44 ] . Rather , imagining futures must seek to break way from tired old patterns of capitalism , anthropocentrism , colonialism , and other frameworks of oppression . Fabulation foregrounds feminist commitments when imagining futures ; either through re - imagining pasts and inviting for diverse fabulation " across a geographically diverse set of communities " [ 66 ] , and / or by " align [ ing ] with intersec - tional feminist , anti - racist , postcolonial , and overall power - critical concerns " [ 53 ] . Building on feminist fabulation , our practice and articulation of fabulation also intersect with more - than - human con - cerns . With HCI’s turn to posthumanism and more - than - human design , we see fabulation , with its focus on multispecies storytelling and non - human temporalities , as a promising feminist unsettling of human - centered HCI methodologies [ 51 ] . It is our humble yet urgent hope that fabulation can ofer some partial approaches for imaginings that break the mold by foregrounding diverse fourish - ings . 8 CONCLUSION In this paper we have refected on our design practices involving speculative fabulation , to contribute towards the emerging poten - tials of fabulating as an open - ended and joyful approach in design futuring . Fabulations invite researchers and designers to mobilize storytelling to foreground absent or neglected relations when imag - ining alternative lifewords . As a design approach , fabulation aligns with current calls for design and HCI to adopt feminist theories to catalyze social change , and incorporate more - than - human con - cerns to respond to climate crisis . With a focus on materiality , shifting temporalities and the cultivation of imagination , design is in a unique position to gain from the critical delights of fabulation , and contribute towards other disciplines that leverage fabulation , such as STS and environmental humanities . With this paper , we wish to draw attention to these potentials and open up and further stimulate emerging research and practice of fabulation in design .
