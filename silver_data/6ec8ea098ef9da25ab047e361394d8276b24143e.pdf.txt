Kirschner Analiese DiConti November 19 , 2009 1 Experimental Question • Is there an intrinsic mechanism for coordinating growth and cell cycle in metazoan cells ? • If so , what is this mechanism dependent on ? 2 Background • Two models : – Exponential growth – Linear growth • Other systems • Other systems – Budding Yeast – size dependent growth rate – Bacteria - unknown 3 Background • Metazoan System – Unclear whether regulation exists – Regulation may be the result of separate growth and mitogenic signals from the environment and mitogenic signals from the environment – Conflicting studies • Statistics – Need for synchronized populations – Cell Cycle Inhibitors 4 Background • Purpose : Determination of the growth function for lymphoblastoid lukemia cells • How : Combined a gentle cell synchronization • How : Combined a gentle cell synchronization technique with mathematical analysis 5 Measuring size dependency on growth in asynchronous populations • Collin Richmond Method : – At steady state , # cells smaller than size S only increases when cells larger than size S divide and only decreases when cells smaller than size S grow only decreases when cells smaller than size S grow – Proportion of cells of any size does not change in time , so two numbers must be equal • Problem : Requires size distribution of newborn subpopulation and distribution of cells just before division . Difficult to obtain 6 Measuring size dependency on growth in asynchronous populations • Subpopulation of newborns – Mouse lymphoblastoids on a membranemembrane – Division • One daughter cell eluted • Other continues to divide Unsynchronized Population Newborn Population 7 Measuring size dependency on growth in asynchronous populations 8 Implementation of Collins - Richmond Method v ( s ) = Cell Growth Rate f a ( s ) = asynchronous size probability distribution F a ( s ) = cumulative f a ( s ) F 0 ( s ) = newborn cumulative size distribution δ ( Δ ) = distribution of differences between newborns α = fraction of dividing cells / minute 9 Conclusions from Collins - Richmond • Larger cells have higher growth rates throughout most of cell size range . • Beyond critical size ( vol = 2000fl for L1210 ) , trend is reversed , but 65 % of population has trend is reversed , but 65 % of population has already divided before reaching this size But , C - R is inadequate because of growth rate heterogeneity within the population 10 Time dependency of growth • Comparison of pairs of size distributions from synchronized populations at one hour intervals • Average rate at which cells grow in each interval 11 Deconvolve to find then use that to find c n for each time point Relate calculate values c n to the mean growth rates β n Time dependency of growth c n = mean c value at t = n = probability distribution of c in f n = measured distribution from time n rates β n 12 • Mean linear growth constants for each time interval Time dependency of growth • Distribution of cell cycle stages • Mean exponential growth constants for each time interval 13 Time dependency of growth 14 Dependence of Cell Division on Time and Size • Is there a size gate that shortens the cell cycle ? – Examine Interval at which most cells divide ( 9 - 12 hours ) hours ) – Use growth exponential constants and compare size distributions at consecutive time intervals 15 Dependence of Cell Division on Time and Size • Calculate frequency of cell division as a function of cell cycle time 16 Cells at same age Cells at same size Dependence of Cell Division on Time and Size • If cells were all same age , likelihood of division increased with increasing cell size • If cells were all same size , likelihood of division increased with increasing age increased with increasing age • If ψ = likelihood of division , τ = cell age , and s = cell size , probability of division : 17 Discussion • Size of cell reflects the relationship of its growth rate and division frequency • Accelerative growth phase in G 1 follow by stable exponential growth during the rest of stable exponential growth during the rest of the cell cycle • Growth and division independently determined by size and age • Very large cells ( above threshold ) behave differently than this model 18
