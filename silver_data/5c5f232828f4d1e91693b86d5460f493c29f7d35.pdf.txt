A R T I C L E S STATE - OWNED ENTERPRISES AROUND THE WORLD AS HYBRID ORGANIZATIONS GARRY D . BRUTON Texas Christian University and Sun Yat - sen University MIKE W . PENG University of Texas at Dallas DAVID AHLSTROM The Chinese University of Hong Kong CIPRIAN STAN Florida Atlantic University KEHAN XU Sun Yat - sen University State - owned enterprises represent approximately 10 % of global gross domestic product . Yet they remain relatively underexplored by management scholars . Firms have often been viewed dichotomously as either state owned or privately owned . Today , however , we encourage a more nuanced view of state - owned enterprises as hybrid organizations , in which the levels of ownership and control by the state can vary . Drawing on 36 cases from four industries in 23 countries , we lay the groundwork for a richer understanding of state - owned enterprises by management scholars in the future . The breakup of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago led many to anticipate the demise of state - owned enterprises ( SOEs ) globally ( Kozmin - ski , 1993 ; Spicer , McDermott , & Kogut , 2000 ) . These predictions , however , have turned out to be largely unfounded . Indeed , SOEs generate approx - imately one tenth of world gross domestic product ( GDP ) and represent approximately 20 % of global equity market value ( Economist , 2010 , 2012a ) . In addition , more than 10 % of the world’s largest firms are state owned , with joint sales of $ 3 . 6 tril - lion in 2011 ( Kowalski , Büge , Sztajerowska , & Ege - land , 2013 ) . And between 2005 and 2012 , SOEs represented nine of the 15 largest initial public offerings ( see Table 1 ) . In certain parts of the world , SOEs play a particularly key role in the economy . For example , SOEs in regions as diverse as Africa , Asia , and Latin America currently provide roughly 15 % of total GDP , often in strategic industries ( Budi - man , Lin , & Singham , 2009 ) . State ownership has been credited with helping developed countries such as France , where the state plays an active role in business , weather the 2008 economic turmoil ( Espi - noza , 2008 ) . Why have SOEs continued to thrive in today’s economy ? We argue that SOEs may have survived and thrived in part because they have evolved to become a type of hybrid organization ( Diefenbach & Sillince , 2011 ; Economist , 2012a ; Inoue , Lazzarini , & Musacchio , 2013 ) . Indeed , today’s SOEs are quite The work in this article was substantially supported by a grant from the RGC Research Grant Direct Allocation Scheme ( Project no . 2070465 , 2011 - 2012 ) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong Special Adminis - trative Region .

For example , to - day’s SOEs have much more private ownership compared to those of the last century ( Economist , 2012a ) . Some hybrid SOEs , such as Brazil’s Petro - bras and Vale , experience high levels of govern - ment ownership but are largely independent in their operations ( Inoue et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , government ownership of other firms , such as En - ergies de Portugal , is relatively low while govern - ment control is high . The existing research on SOEs has tended to view state ownership in black - and - white terms— that is , a firm is either state owned or it is not ( Kornai , 1992 ; Shleifer , 1998 ) —and if state owned , its management and governance falls under the government’s complete ownership and control , thus overlooking this new trend toward greater flexibility . Some limited research has sketched out this hybrid model , but much of it has a public administration orientation ( Koppell , 2007 ) . Yet the rich contextualization of important aspects of man - agement , including aspects of firm strategy and cor - porate governance , need to be better understood under such varying conditions of state ownership and control ( cf . Cooke , 2003 ; Kowalski et al . , 2013 ) . State ownership reduces the firms’ profit imper - ative while introducing additional governance mat - ters ; thus , state ownership offers a wide variety of rich theoretical issues for study ( Liang , Ren & Sun , 2014 ; Young , Peng , Ahlstrom , Bruton , & Jiang , 2008 ) . Specifically , because an SOE’s function ( Jen - sen , 2001 ) is not necessarily one of profit maximi - zation ( Ghosh & Whalley , 2008 ) , SOEs often repre - sent a means to contextualize theory more fully than if private firms alone were being studied . That is , if the SOEs’ chief goal is something other than maximizing profit , such as increasing market share or employment levels , then it cannot be assumed that SOEs will behave ( or should be managed ) in the same manner as private firms . This is consistent with the argument that the firm’s objective function should be made clear in theories of the firm ( Jen - sen , 2001 ; Young , Tsai , Wang , Liu , & Ahlstrom , 2014 ) and in terms of the various aspects of their governance ( Musacchio & Lazzarini , 2014 ; Young et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , SOEs need to be examined in new ways to better understand this crucial organi - zational form . This suggests two important and un - derexplored research questions . First , what is the nature of SOEs in the 21st century ? And second , what contributes to their ability to survive and , in some cases , prosper ? We address these questions by first reviewing recent SOE literature in leading academic journals . Then , to fill the gaps identified by our review , we study 36 cases of hybrid SOEs in four specific in - dustries across 23 countries . We specifically look at key issues in these SOEs , such as leadership and how the state may affect the firm’s decisions about strategic issues . Overall , this paper makes four contributions . First , in terms of empirical contribution , the case studies will provide a fuller analysis of state firms , particularly in terms of the understudied hybrid TABLE 1 State - Owned Enterprises Represent 9 of the 15 Largest IPOs from 2005 to 2012 Company Industry Year Value ( $ billion ) Agricultural Bank of China ( SOE ) Finance 2010 22 . 1 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( SOE ) Finance 2006 21 . 9 AIA ( Hong Kong ) Insurance 2010 20 . 5 Visa ( United States ) Finance 2008 19 . 7 General Motors ( United States ) ( SOE ) Automotive 2010 18 . 1 Bank of China ( SOE ) Finance 2006 11 . 2 Dai - ichi Life Insurance ( Japan ) Insurance 2010 11 . 1 Rosneft ( Russia ) ( SOE ) Oil and gas 2006 10 . 7 Glencore International ( Switzerland ) Mining 2011 10 . 0 China Construction Bank ( SOE ) Finance 2005 9 . 2 Electricité de France ( SOE ) Utility and energy 2005 9 . 0 VTB Group ( Russia ) ( SOE ) Finance 2007 8 . 0 Banco Santander Brasil Finance 2009 7 . 5 China State Construction Engineering Corp .

Second , this paper also adds to theory and evidence regarding research on the varieties of cap - italism ( Hall & Soskice , 2001 ) . Much past theory and empirical work on varieties of capitalism has examined the important differences among na - tional economies and the impact of these varieties to economies as a whole ( Hall & Soskice , 2001 ; Whitley , 1998 ) . Despite the importance of the sec - tor , this literature has generally paid little attention to state ownership because it traditionally was not considered a type of capitalism ( e . g . , Ahlstrom , Bruton , & Yeh , 2008 ; Gourevitch & Shinn , 2005 ) . This paper focuses more on the varied ways in which states intervene in the management and ownership of firms . Third , the paper also contributes to practice by further identifying the range of stakeholders and the resulting objective functions with which SOE management must contend . Managers of non - SOE firms in a developed economy that do business with SOEs in countries such as China or Russia , for example , need to understand such hybrid organi - zations if they are to successfully work with their counterparts , given that the SOEs’ strategy and goals can differ significantly from those of non - SOE firms , such as placing more emphasis on employ - ment levels or on market share ( Battilana & Dorado , 2010 ; Young , Ahlstrom , Bruton , & Rubanik , 2011 ) . Finally , this study also allows us to address the concern that although there is widespread ac - knowledgment that the state matters significantly to organizations , the mechanisms by which the state matters require much more attention ( Bai & Wang , 1998 ; Musacchio & Lazzarini , 2014 ) . WHAT DOES RECENT SCHOLARSHIP SAY ABOUT SOEs ? The question of what recent scholarship says about SOEs can be answered in two words : not much—at least among the top - tier academic jour - nals . 1 To date scholars have published only limited research on SOEs in leading journals . In reviewing this literature , we systematically and comprehen - sively examined the journals of the Financial Times’ top 45 list ( FT 45 ) 2 from 2000 to 2014 , inclusive . Using the search term state - owned enter - prise ( or SOE ) in the title or abstract , we were able to identify only 57 articles from that 15 - year period . Two of those articles appeared in the more practi - tioner - oriented Harvard Business Review , leaving 55 scholarly articles . Sixteen of these 55 articles were on the privatization of SOEs . As a result , only 39 articles out of thousands published by the FT 45 top journals during the most recent 15 - year period actually focused on the management of SOEs . 3 Al - though inquiry into SOEs is on the rise , as noted in Figure 1 , there is still a dearth of research on the topic . The 39 SOE articles outlined in Table 2 touch on a wide variety of issues , but with such a limited number it is possible to generate only a few com - mon insights . First , almost all 39 articles viewed SOEs dichotomously—that is , firms were labeled as either completely state owned or not . In one of the few articles whose authors did not hold the dichotomous view , Gupta ( 2005 ) acknowledged the potential for mixed ownership structures , with the state maintaining varying levels of owner - ship even in publicly listed companies . It is impor - tant to note that Gupta ( 2005 ) is a finance article and that management and organizational research dealing with mixed ownership remains very limited . A second common insight derived from the 39 articles is that researchers have disagreed on the impact of state ownership on firm performance . For example , Ralston , Terpstra - Tong , Terpstra , Wang , and Egri ( 2006 ) reported that SOE managers in China perceived their firms to be more competitive than private firms . However , Goldeng , Grünfeld , and Benito ( 2008 ) found that private firms in Nor - way clearly outperformed SOEs . These and other conflicting findings may have resulted from the authors dichotomizing their samples into state and nonstate entities without considering hybrid SOEs . 4 A third insight is that the 39 articles on SOEs to date have not examined the topic of SOE hybrids in 1 Even the comprehensive Handbook of Organiza - tional Economics ( Gibbons & Roberts , 2013 ) and one of the major texts on growth economics ( Acemoglu , 2009 ) only occasionally mention state ownership of firms . 2 These are the journals the Financial Times uses to compile its business school research rank . The Academy of Management Perspectives is included in this list . 3 All of those 39 articles are marked with an asterisk ( * ) in the references section . 4 Recent research in finance has also started to address this issue in discussing partial privatization and how government participation can affect the performance of state - owned or state - linked firms ( e . g . , Fan , Wong , & Zhang , 2007 ) . 94 February The Academy of Management Perspectives a wide variety of countries . Thirty of the 39 articles focused on China , three on India , and one each on Norway , Brazil , and Russia , while two had a cross - country sample and one was a theory paper . Thus , the existing SOE literature—at least the literature in the top - tier ( FT ) journals—is primarily a literature on Chinese SOEs . While China is clearly an inter - esting strategic research site for comprehending SOEs ( Ahlstrom , Nair , Young , & Wang , 2006 ; Bi - jker , Hughes , & Pinch , 2012 ) , they are important in many other countries as well ( Carney & Child , 2012 ; Economist , 2012a , 2012c ) . Indeed , SOEs are a global phenomenon . In many countries ranging from Saudi Arabia to Sweden , SOEs are important ( if not dominant ) employers ( Sjöholm , 2007 ) . Yet studies on SOEs in China often make a very limited effort to address whether their findings have rele - vance to SOEs elsewhere . A final insight from the existing literature is that there has traditionally been a black - and - white lens used in the research : Firms are SOEs or they are not . It is surprising that an organizational form that generates so much impact on global GDP has at - tracted such limited research attention in the top - tier scholarly literature—on average 2 . 6 articles per year have been published in recent years on SOEs in the FT 45 journals . Of course , there are many more articles on SOEs than the 39 published in the FT journals . For example , two of the main manage - ment journals in Asia—Asia Pacific Journal of Management ( APJM ) and Management and Orga - nization Review ( MOR ) —have devoted consider - able journal space to SOEs in Asia , and our re - search for this article has benefited from such coverage ( e . g . , Li , Xia , Long , & Tan , 2012 ; Stan , Peng , & Bruton , 2014 ; Tipton , 2009 ) . An interesting subsidiary question can be raised : Why is the vol - ume of SOE research published in the top - tier ( FT ) journals not more proportional to the share of global GDP contributed by SOEs ( approximately 10 % ) , many of which are very large organizations ? 5 We believe there are two fundamental issues that underlie the lack of coverage of SOEs in top - tier journals . First , top - tier journals focus on theory building and testing , and most existing theories of the firm have historically been developed in the United States ( Young et al . , 2014 ) . The result is that theories of the firm that top - tier journals use and develop have naturally emphasized organizational attributes most salient for the U . S . economy , which historically does not have a sizable SOE sector . To the extent that limited work on SOEs has pene - trated top - tier journals , authors often have to twist existing ( often U . S . - centric ) theories of the firm to fit SOE realities ( Meyer , 2006 ) . 5 This issue is not the sole purview of state - owned enterprises research . A similar question can be raised : Why is the volume of family business research published in the top - tier journals not proportionate with the share of global GDP contributed by family businesses ? Most family business research can be found in more special - ized journals such as Family Business Review ( Sharma , Chrisman , & Chua , 1997 ; Sharma & Chua , 2013 ) .

M g m t . C h i n a Second , the ideological nature of the debate on state ownership has resulted in the difficulties of incorporating SOEs into ( mainstream ) theories of the firm . Some work has framed the debate as so - cialism versus capitalism , which may have made it more difficult in terms of theory and ideology for Western scholars to highlight the merits of SOEs , especially in the last quarter - century . Among most scholars and policymakers in the West , it has al - most become an article of faith that SOEs are less efficient than private firms ( Dewenter & Malatesta , 2001 ) . Thus , instead of studying SOEs on their own terms , many scholars have viewed them primarily as targets for privatization ( Economist , 2014 ; Fila - totchev , Buck , & Zhukov , 2000 ; Kozminski , 1993 ; Megginson & Netter , 2001 ; Vickers & Yarrow , 1991 ) . The privatization movement throughout the world since the 1980s seems to suggest that SOEs are a transitional organizational form destined to become relics of history ( Spicer et al . , 2000 ) . But , as discussed earlier , this has not happened . Instead , in response to the 2008 economic crisis , even gov - ernments in developed economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom partially nationalized major private firms such as General Motors ( GM ) and the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) . For management and organizational research to further build its relevance and insight into impor - tant contemporary issues , we must address the dis - connect between the limited scholarly coverage in top - tier journals and the wide - ranging real - world realities of the major organizational form of the SOE ( Christensen & Carlile , 2009 ; Makino & Yiu , 2014 ) . HYBRID ORGANIZATIONS A key characteristic of SOEs today—and a reason why they have been able to prosper—is their ability to adapt and take on a new organizational form ( Musacchio & Lazzarini , 2014 ) . This new form , known as hybrid organizations , “incorporate [ s ] el - ements from different institutional logics” ( Pache & Santos , 2013 , p . 972 ) . Clearly , state ownership and private ownership represent different institutional logics ( Bruton , Ahlstrom , & Li , 2010 ) , thus necessi - tating our consideration of SOEs incorporating both state and private ownership as hybrid organiza - tions ( Inoue et al . , 2013 ) . When managed well , hy - brid organizations can harvest legitimacy - enhanc - ing elements of the different institutional logics , and survive and thrive ( Battilana & Dorado , 2010 ) . One can trace the treatment of ownership and control in the management literature to the seminal work by Berle and Means ( 1932 ) , The Modern Cor - poration and Private Property , which argued that diffused ownership in modern firms prevented meaningful control by owners and created poten - tial agency problems . The view of ownership and control as directly related is consistent with the fact that three decades ago scholars typically thought of SOEs as enterprises operating in command econo - mies , where the state had absolute ownership as well as control over state enterprises , a belief that was understandable given the prevalence of SOEs in these economies ( Kornai , 1992 ; Peng & Heath , 1996 ; Shleifer , 1998 ) . The setting SOEs face today is more complex . Rather than being simply state owned , most SOEs today mix private and public ownership ( Econo - mist , 2012a ; Flores - Macias & Musacchio , 2009 ; Huang & Orr , 2007 ; Woetzel , 2008 ) . Facing complex ownership and control patterns , investors and other stakeholders need to be sensitive as they look to partner with or invest in SOEs ( Bruton , Ahl - strom , & Wan , 2003 ; Young et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , researchers should also view state ownership as a continuous variable ( Gupta , 2005 ; Jing & Tyle - cote , 2005 ) . However , it should also be recognized that own - ership in this setting does not necessarily equate to control ( Sheng & Zhao , 2012 ; Sun & Tong , 2003 ) . In China , for example , control of the firm comes from the offering of different types of shares . Shares that vote on control issues may be held by the central government , by various local governments , or by other SOEs ( Sheng & Zhao , 2012 ; Xu & Wang , 1999 ) . For example , the Chinese central govern - ment is the controlling shareholder of the Agricul - tural Bank of China , but the bank has governance traits that allow much participation by private in - vestors . Such patterns can be found in other coun - tries as well ( Flinders , 2006 ; Mishra , 2009 ; Tipton , 2009 ) . It is more appropriate , therefore , to view SOEs as hybrid organizations that consist of differ - ent mixtures of private ownership and control by the state ( Huang & Orr , 2007 ; Koppell , 2007 ) . Thus , as we think of our two research questions in this paper— ( 1 ) what is the nature of SOEs today ? and ( 2 ) why have they been able to survive and pros - per ? —the resulting organizational form that SOEs have taken on becomes quite important . Therefore , we focus on defining SOEs as hybrid organizations and highlighting their strategic and performance implications . 2015 97 Bruton , Peng , Ahlstrom , Stan , and Xu Some research published in the 1980s recognized hybrid organizations that mix public and private ownership . For example , Emmert and Crow ( 1988 ) examined hybrid public – private firms in the United States such as the Overseas Private Invest - ment Corporation ( OPIC ) , which facilitates U . S . in - vestment in developing countries . This early re - search on hybrids generally sought to understand traditional government - run activities that were privatized , such as trash collection or waterworks . Such hybrids typically did not face competition for their services from other firms in the local market - place . In contrast , today’s hybrid SOEs increasingly operate in competitive product markets , which calls for a new understanding of their rationales , operations , and performance as well as the relevant institutional environments . MARKETS , HIERARCHIES , AGENTS , AND INSTITUTIONS Following the earlier SOE research that appeared in top - tier journals ( Inoue et al . , 2013 ; Peng & Heath , 1996 ) , we draw on three core managerial theories that help scholars understand all organiza - tions to develop our understanding of hybrid SOE firms : transaction cost economics , agency theory , and neoinstitutional theory . These three theories can form a foundation for scholars to further de - velop an understanding of the similarities and dif - ferences between SOEs and other organizations . Transaction Cost Economics From a transaction cost standpoint , Williamson ( 1975 , 1992 ) identified two basic forms of eco - nomic organizations : markets and hierarchies . Each organizational form has its own rationale ( Steier , 1998 ) . The self - interested actions of individuals and firms , focusing on issues such as prices and profits , form the basis for market organizations . In contrast , the rationale for hierarchical organiza - tions is that “the visible hand of management sup - plants the invisible hand of market in coordinating supply and demand” ( Powell , 1990 , p . 303 ; see also Chandler , 1977 ) . Williamson ( 1985 ) acknowledged that organizations may combine aspects of both market and hierarchy to create a “middle kind” of organization , and in fact went on to call for greater attention to such middle kinds of firms and eco - nomic organizations . Huang ( 1990 ) found some early examples of hybrid state firms in China , while Powell ( 1990 , p . 299 ) went further , adding that “ [ b ] y sticking to the twin pillars of markets and hierarchies , our attention is deflected from a diver - sity of organizational designs . ” Thus , from a transaction cost perspective , hy - brids can be viewed as organizations that “combine aspects of market transactions and characteristics of hierarchies and fall between the two alternatives on a continuum” ( Larson , 1992 , p . 76 ) . Hybrid or - ganizations are “highly significant features of the contemporary organizational landscape” ( Powell , 1987 , p . 68 ) . However , the research focus for such hybrids has been on government agencies ( André , 2010 ; Steier , 1998 ) , such as how to make these agencies act in a more business - like manner ( Os - borne & Gaebler , 1992 ; Pollitt & Bouckaert , 2004 ) . Scholars have also recognized hybrid organizations in the commercial sector ( Battilana & Dorado , 2010 ; Pache & Santos , 2013 ; Shane , 1996 ) , but those ex - aminations of business have typically focused on private firms performing government services . As a result , there remains a lack of understanding of SOEs that are hybrid firms conducting business activities . Agency Theory Insights on hybrid SOEs can also be drawn from agency theory as it addresses the conflicting inter - ests between managers ( agents ) and the owners ( principals ) on whose behalf they manage organi - zations ( Eisenhardt , 1989 ) . Classical agency theory assumes that both principals and agents are self - interest – seeking utility maximizers , with agents being risk averse and principals , who could di - versify their holdings , being risk neutral ( Sha - piro , 2005 ) . However , given the hybrid nature of many SOEs , a multiple agency theory perspective enables us to see that SOEs have potential con - flicts of interests among different agent groups ( Arthurs , Hoskisson , Busenitz , & Johnson , 2008 ) . The result is that SOEs face conflicting choices in regard to which principals’ interests they should serve , more so than most private firms , especially given the “conflicting voices” that those princi - pals may have as an outcome of different incen - tives and time horizons ( Ghosh & Whalley , 2008 ; Hoskisson , Hitt , Johnson , & Grossman , 2002 ; Jen - sen , 2001 ) . Such principal – principal conflicts be - tween controlling and minority shareholders , which may lead to suboptimal strategic deci - sions , are present in SOEs operating in emerging and developing economies ( Young et al . , 2008 ) . In this setting the fiduciary duty of agents , such 98 February The Academy of Management Perspectives as the boards of directors , is not to any specific group of stakeholders such as shareholders . In - stead , the fiduciary duty is to the organization itself ( Lan & Heracleous , 2010 ; Mehrotra , 2011 ) . Institutional Theory Regardless of whether they are wholly state - owned “classical” types or hybrid types , SOEs are clearly products of their institutional environ - ments , thus rendering an institutional lens as a helpful theoretical tool ( DiMaggio & Powell , 1991 ; Godfrey , 2014 ) . Specifically , neoinstitutional the - ory posits that the taken - for - granted assumptions , laws , rules , norms , and boundaries in established organizational fields strongly affect the behavior of actors ( North , 1990 ; Peng , Sun , Pinkham , & Chen , 2009 ; Scott , 2014 ) . Much past research has viewed institutions , such as societal laws or cultural val - ues , as macro - level variables that affect an entire society ( Meyer , Estrin , Bhaumik , & Peng , 2009 ) . However , Wicks ( 2001 ) argued that institutions also occur at the micro level . Specifically , a mind - set can develop that affects the firms in that indus - try or profession in terms of the standards and commercial conventions in that industry or profes - sion ( Eisenhardt , 1988 ; McCloskey , 1994 ) . Employ - ing such a micro - level perspective , Vermeulen , Van Den Bosch , and Volberda ( 2007 ) examined how micro institutional forces , including the mindset of managers at the business unit level of a firm , affect incremental product innovation efforts in the fi - nancial services industry . Inspired by such work , we examine both the macro and micro levels of institutions and their impact on SOEs . Overall , as driven by transaction cost , agency , and institutional logics , via a series of case studies , we focus on how SOEs mix ownership and control as hybrid organizations , and on how different macro and micro institutions affect differ - ent levels of state ownership and control . CASE ANALYSIS Developing a greater understanding of hybrid SOEs is a complex and nuanced task . We define the institutional field in terms of national boundaries and examine SOEs from a diverse set of countries and industries to understand how they operate ( Greenwood & Suddaby , 2006 ) . The goal is to un - derstand how SOEs behave in a single country and to also understand more broadly the strategic ac - tions that affect such firms across a wide range of countries and regions of the world . Therefore , we employed a purposive case selection ( Yin , 2013 ) . We thus sought to cover a range of industries gen - erally important in the state sector by selecting cases of SOEs from four specific industry sectors— natural resources / energy , transportation , manufac - turing , and finance—for each of the different mix - tures of ownership and control we examined . We chose these sectors to ensure our consider - ation of a wide range of firms and industries . We also selected these four sectors because they allow us to address specific concerns . First , these sectors are not directly related to national security , and thus face some market - based competition . Second , the industry concentration is modest in these in - dustries , and therefore monopoly is not a concern . We also wanted to be able to compare firms in the same industry in different settings of ownership and control ( Brouthers & Bamossy , 2006 ) . Addi - tionally , given that rather narrow geographic scope is a limitation of current SOE research , we sought a broad set of countries . Thus , our sample includes 23 countries . The ability to have some cases from the same country in different cells of the matrix , reflecting different levels of ownership and control , however , also allowed us to ensure that the results we identified were not due to strictly country - spe - cific factors . For these cases we wanted to gather a rich range of data from the popular and business press , annual reports if available , and reported financial data . Thus , a major requirement in the case - selection process was the availability of a wide variety of information for each company , as there is very lim - ited information released about some SOEs by gov - ernments or by other sources . We also ensured that the firms we examined had market - based competi - tors . In selecting the cases we focused in a manner suggested by established methodology for qualita - tive research to ensure that the cases were clear and distinct in their nature . Qualitative research gener - ally does not focus on average cases but on those cases that allow clear contrasts to be emphasized so that rich understanding can be developed ( Ragin , 1987 ; Yin , 2013 ) . As noted earlier , research on hy - brid public – private firms has tended to focus on public entities that perform a public function but seek to operate more as private firms . Here our focus is on state - owned businesses that face com - petition either locally or internationally to allow us to examine more clearly the strategic decisions the firms make . 2015 99 Bruton , Peng , Ahlstrom , Stan , and Xu To highlight the hybrid nature of SOEs , we con - structed a 3 (cid:2) 3 matrix showing levels of govern - ment ownership and government control ( see Table 3 ) . We defined “high level of government owner - ship” as ownership greater than 50 % , “intermedi - ate level” as 25 % to 50 % , and “low level” as less than 25 % . These levels were chosen to ensure a clear representation of ownership ( Kowalski et al . , 2013 ) . The horizontal axis representing the level of government control is divided into high , middle , and low categories based on case histories of the firms and a judgment by the authors grounded in reports of government control ( Easterby - Smith , Golden - Biddle , & Locke , 2008 ) . We first examined a large number of SOEs . We then selected cases that fit the requirements of each cell . As noted above , we focused on the cases pro - viding clear and strong examples of the given level of ownership and desired level of control . If after further examination of these cases a firm’s level of ownership or government control differed from our expectations , we selected another case . The authors eventually came to an agreement on the placement of all cases in the cells . Two research assistants then reviewed the cases and validated the place - ment . Through this process we developed 36 cases of SOEs that populate the nine cells . RESULTS SOEs as Hybrid Organizations Our rich and diverse set of cases supports the argument that on a worldwide basis a new form of SOE has developed in which there are variations in ownership and control . The traditional SOE , with high levels of ownership by government and corre - spondingly high levels of control , still exists ( see cell 3 in Table 3 ) . However , the presence of a rich range of cases in which ownership and control appear to be far more mixed supports our argument for the emergence of a new form of organization , in which public and private ownership and control mix to match the needs of the given setting . These settings vary widely . For example , the Sin - gapore government recognized that while it could supply large amounts of investment capital it could not efficiently manage high - technology firms ( Bruton , Ahlstrom , & Singh , 2002 ) . As a result , when Singapore formed STATS ChipPAC through a 2004 merger to provide semiconductor packaging and testing services ( cell 1 ) , they encouraged an aggressive market - driven approach to firm manage - ment , with a Singapore government holding firm supplying funding ( and owning much equity ) but providing little day - to - day direction . 6 For some SOEs the state has dramatically re - duced its ownership through privatization , but the realities of the political setting in these locations pushed the state to retain strong control over the firm ( Ahlstrom & Bruton , 2010 ) . For example , the Russian government still holds a single “golden share” in more than 180 firms with which the state can veto major firm actions ( Economist , 2012a ) . Scholars report similar levels of control for SOEs in China , with the power to veto resting with the government or the controlling councils , such as the State - owned Assets Supervision and Administra - tion Commission ( SASAC ) of the State Council . The ability of SOEs to adapt to different settings in ways specific to the needs in that location in part explains why some SOEs have not only survived but often prospered despite many predictions of their demise . If the dichotomous choice of full state control and ownership versus pure private owner - ship were all a government could make , then the decline of the SOEs may well have occurred . In - stead , SOEs have been able to adapt and change as needed with the environment and economic situa - tion . As a result , we expect that most SOEs will have some hybrid features that mix state and pri - vate ownership and control . Hybrid Organizations and Control One key area that merits future investigation is the nature of the control of the SOE and its impact on performance . While the authors of one of the 39 SOE articles we reviewed for this article reported that managers in China perceived SOEs’ perfor - mance to be better than that of private firms ( Ral - ston et al . , 2006 ) , researchers ( particularly in eco - nomics ) have found that state ownership does not generate superior firm performance ( Bartel & Har - rison , 2005 ) and is often a drag on both productiv - ity and even national income ( Hsieh & Klenow , 2009 ; Kornai , 1992 ; Shleifer , 1998 ) . 6 STATS ChipPAC was recently sold to Chinese elec - tronics firm Jiangsu Changjiang . The Singapore govern - ment realized a healthy return from the sale ( http : / / finance . burgtelegram . com / news / otc - markets / jiangsu - changjiang - wholly - acquires - stats - chippac / jiangsu - chang jiang - wholly - acquires - stats - chippac - 13634948 . htm , ac - cessed January 22 , 2015 ) . 100 February The Academy of Management Perspectives T A B LE 3 S a m p l e F i r m s G ov e r n m e n t c o n t r o l L o w I n t e r m e d i a t e H i g h G ov e r n m e n t o w n e rs h i p H i g h 1 N : S o li d En e r g y ( N e w Z ea l a nd ) T : A l a s k a R a il r o a d C o r p o r a ti o n ( U .

Thus , the state will provide support to a firm with chronic losses , which softens budget constraints and virtually eliminates the possibility of its going out of busi - ness or of being properly restructured ( Davis , Halti - wanger , Jarmin , Lerner , & Miranda , 2011 ; Econo - mist , 2012c ; Kornai , 1992 ) . Such state support can come directly from the government or indirectly from government - controlled institutions ( such as banks or other SOEs ) that provide loans and re - sources to the troubled business . Soft budget con - straints mean that a firm does not need to respond to the market as it continues to receive resources for continued operations ( Sheng & Zhao , 2012 ) . Easy money often causes firms to overinvest in produc - tion equipment and other physical assets , such that they wind up with overcapacity ( Burlingham , 2012 ; Peng & Heath , 1996 ) . They also tend to ignore market signals and many key technologies , partic - ularly during periods of technological ferment ( Le - rner , 2008 ) . The result is that soft budget con - straints can turn the focus of management away from the market or keep firms on a technological path that is becoming unviable ( Kornai , Maskin , & Roland , 2003 ) . However , some of our cases appear to suggest that state control , whether associated with state ownership or not , can result in good performance . Examining the three cells in Table 3 with the high - est levels of government control ( cells 3 , 6 , and 9 ) , we find that two of them—cells 3 and 9—have the highest levels of return on investment ( ROI ) . Stra - tegically , we could not determine whether this per - formance is the result of soft budget constraints in terms of a longer - term outlook or other directly conferred benefits , such as free land , which can also represent a major subsidy to SOEs ( Economist , 2012d ; Hsieh & Klenow , 2009 ) . The research surveyed and data gathered on the case firms suggest that the impact of state support may be significant . For example , Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations is a French bank that describes itself as a state institution whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate in the competitive sector . The bank reported a profit for 2010 . The largest amount of that income was from the increase in value of equity in firms that the bank had invested in . Most of these firms provided services to various levels of the government . These results can help researchers to understand how state - controlled firms can uti - lize the resources the state offers to generate above - average profits or to achieve other goals , such as employment levels , while minimizing the drag on productivity ( Hsieh & Klenow , 2009 ) . Research in both economics and strategic management has yet to clarify the balance between having financial slack and a longer - term outlook versus staying too long with an investment or technological standard when enabled by soft budget constraints . The inter - action among these supports and other factors that characterize SOEs suggest a rich topic for future empirical investigation . Macro Institutions : Institutional Development Several studies have recognized the key role of institutional development in the economic success of a country , both in terms of formal ( Acemoglu & Robinson , 2012 ; North , 1990 ) and informal institu - tions ( Godfrey , 2014 ; McCloskey , 1994 , 2010 ; Mokyr , 2009 ) . This impact partially derives from societal norms that shape the actions of individuals and firms ( Greif , 2006 ; Peng et al . , 2009 ) . The soci - etal norms in countries with a tradition of strong government action will exercise stronger influence over firms in terms of how they behave ( Newman , 2000 ) . The ability of a society to develop new institutional structures that may be supportive of private firms may be weakened by strong institu - tional inertia ( Dacin , Goodstein , & Scott , 2002 ; Mc - Closkey , 2010 ; Ogilvie , 2011 ) . Thus , the develop - ment of institutions in a country in terms of supporting SOEs versus private businesses is criti - cal to SOE performance . We assessed the nature of institutional develop - ment to support private enterprise . Initially we looked at several sources regarding the various countries’ macroeconomic settings and institu - tional development . These ratings concern macro issues in the country , such as whether the country has clear , less intrusive , and more inclusive rules for doing business ( Acemoglu & Robinson , 2012 ) . While there are several economic ranking systems available , here we employed a widely used ranking developed by the Washington , DC – based Heritage Foundation . The Index of Economic Freedom ranking system relies on 10 different commercial and economic factors : business freedom , trade free - dom , fiscal freedom , government spending free - dom , monetary freedom , investment freedom , fi - nancial freedom , property rights , freedom from corruption , and labor freedom . Each of these vari - 102 February The Academy of Management Perspectives ables describes the level of development of national institutions that support business . As with any such measure , different sources will vary in their rankings . However , alternative rank - ing systems show broad agreement . Hong Kong , Singapore , and the United States tend to rank higher on economic freedom than other countries represented in our cases . The individual rank of a given country may vary slightly , but the overall view of economic freedom typically does not vary much in these sources . Thus , we employ the Index of Economic Freedom for each economy in our 36 cases , to determine the strength of institutions that support business in each country . From our examination of the cases , government control in SOEs appears to be negatively correlated with the overall institutional development in sup - port of private enterprise . In other words , govern - ment control is more likely to occur in settings with limited institutional development supporting busi - ness . Cell 1 of Table 3 represents low government control and high government ownership . All firms in the cell are in the top 10 economies that have developed institutional support for private busi - ness , according to the Heritage Foundation . Simi - larly , as we look at cell 3 , which represents firms with high state ownership and control , three of the four cases come from countries in the bottom third in terms of development of institutions to support private business ( India , China , and Russia ) . Look - ing deeper at individual firms , one easily sees this kind of government intervention in firms such as the Russian airline Aeroflot , which still looks for government approval of key decisions , such as pur - chasing new aircraft . It is also interesting to note that the level of government ownership of firms does not correlate positively or negatively to insti - tutional development in support of private enter - prise . Thus , institutional development does not seem to be related to government ownership but seems to be related to government control . We suggest a caveat that appears to moderate the relationship between the impact of government control and economic freedom . The cases demon - strate that as the importance of an SOE’s products increases so does the level of governmental control . For example , cell 9 contains a mining firm ( Vale ) that many believe will ultimately provide great benefits to Brazil as offshore oil is developed . This cell also contains core industries such as the largest Russian insurance firm . If we look at the cells that border cell 9 ( cells 6 and 8 , which also reflect high levels of government control ) , we continue to see firms that have a disproportionate impact on their countries , whether economically , strategically , or in terms of GDP and employment ( McGregor , 2012 ) . Thus , ownership by the state may not be high , but if the economic and strategic importance of the industry or firm is great ( such as with energy or steel ) , then the government is much more likely to assert itself in the management of the firm through high levels of control , even when lacking high levels of ownership . This suggests that schol - ars should pursue such rich topics as the interac - tion between institutional development for private business and how that institutional development also affects SOEs . In addition , the impact of the strategic importance of an industry or firm on the nature of the relationship to the government ap - pears ripe for investigation . Scholars will need to recognize that different countries define different industries as strategic , and this will affect the insti - tutional logics facing state firms . Micro Institutions : CEOs Neoinstitutional theory argues that institutions operate not only at the macro level of analysis but also at the micro level ( Meyer et al . , 2009 ; Scott , 2014 ) . Typically , neoinstitutional theory has more commonly focused on the macro level . However , micro - level institutions shape values and percep - tions of how to do business in a given industry or region ( Wicks , 2001 ) while shaping key activities such as innovation and several commercial conven - tions ( McCloskey , 1994 , 2010 ) . Thus , individual ac - tivities can act to build or maintain institutions ( Hobsbawm & Ranger , 1992 ; Nee & Opper , 2012 ) . In SOEs , one important type of micro institution is the office of the CEO , whose authority and mind - set are very important to firm operations . The back - ground and experience of the CEO of the firm is critical in setting that mindset and driving key be - haviors ( McCall , 1998 ) . The main goal of ( most ) governments is job creation and stability , not nec - essarily economic efficiency . If the CEO of the SOE comes from the government or has always worked for the SOE sector , the CEO may be more likely to inherit a mindset that stresses job maintenance and operations , not necessarily firm efficiency or stra - tegic orientation ( Ahlstrom , 2014 ) . The background of such individuals encourages a mindset , or way of doing things , that is consistent with that of typ - ical government processes and goals—but not nec - essarily with those of private enterprise ( McCall , 1998 ; Steinfeld , 1998 ) . Because of this government 2015 103 Bruton , Peng , Ahlstrom , Stan , and Xu mindset , the CEO may willingly comply when a government official asks the SOE to acquire an - other firm , redistribute its profits to subsidize the government’s social welfare objectives ( e . g . , fund - ing local schools or health care ) , or continue to expand even in the face of unfavorable market or factor market conditions or other problems ( Lu , 2006 ; Shi , Markoczy , & Stan , 2014 ) . Table 4 summarizes the backgrounds of the CEOs for each of our case firms . The CEOs of firms on the left side of the chart , where government control is low , almost always come from private industry . On the right side , where government control is high , we find it common that the executives come from the government , or have worked for SOEs consis - tently . To illustrate , in cell 6 of Table 4 , the CEO of three of the four cases came from some form of gov - ernment background , having previously worked ei - ther for an SOE or for the military . The institutionalization of new practices requires some disassociation with the historical context ( Barley & Tolbert , 1997 ) . The expectation is that in cases where there is a CEO who has worked for the state or for an SOE and a high level of government control , the two may act to reinforce the concern for issues other than economic performance . The CEO who has worked for the state brings a mindset consistent with state goals and not necessarily with the profit - maximization goals associated with pri - vate firms . The focus of the government and of the CEO ( who has a state background ) tends to be on the maintenance of employment and other social concerns rather than necessarily firm efficiency ( Baron & Kreps , 1999 ; McCall , 1998 ) . As a result , government control can negatively affect the SOE’s economic performance or may push the SOE to - ward production maximization as opposed to inno - vation and ROI ( Economist , 2012a ; Lerner , 2008 ) . Micro institutions are similar to macro institu - tions in that both have the ability to not only sup - port but also to change and shape institutional de - velopment ( Barley & Tolbert , 1997 ; Greif , 2006 ; Steinfeld , 2010 ) . Thus , we expect CEOs whose backgrounds are not in government or in the SOE sector to have more skills and experience to re - shape SOEs to be more innovative and market ori - ented ( McCall , 1998 ) . Similarly , CEOs can take over SOEs that have historically had wide latitude to operate independently to bring these firms back into greater alignment with the government’s goals or turn them around ( Bruton , Ahlstrom , & Wan , 2001 ) . To illustrate , Valeo , a French auto parts manufacturer in cell 8 , changed its CEO in 2009 . The goal was to bring in a CEO who combined both government experience and private industry back - ground to better manage the firm and address its strategic challenges . The new CEO replaced the previous one , who had had only government expe - rience . The government and other investors wanted someone who would have the ability to better turn the firm around in the given financial crisis , and cut hours or employment if necessary to increase the firm’s ability to weather the financial crisis . SOE top management attributes and experience and their link to SOE action and performance is potentially a rich topic for future research in man - agement ( Bruton et al . , 2003 ; Maheshwari & Ahl - strom , 2004 ) . DISCUSSION Much of the limited previous research on SOEs has largely assumed a direct correlation between state ownership and control as well as a dichotomy between state owned and private firms . These as - sumptions appear unwarranted . Today hybrid or - ganizations that mix ownership and control are the dominant form of SOE organizations . Building on this recognition allows a far more detailed and bet - ter - informed analysis of SOEs than has occurred in the past . Our first contribution highlights the hy - brid nature of many of today’s SOEs , which are important but remain underexplored . Extending transaction cost , agency , and neoinstitutional the - ories , this research with an SOE focus also has the potential to push the frontiers of these theories further by focusing attention on factors that medi - ate and moderate SOE strategy , structure , and out - comes . For example , the hybrid nature of SOEs in many countries suggests ways in which state firms can balance multiple stakeholders effectively in terms of legitimacy building with the government while also seeking to maximize profit for share - holders . Alternatively , SOEs also offer insights on how strategy must be viewed differently when profit maximization is not the top priority . Moreover , this paper adds to the literature on varieties of capitalism research ( Hall & Soskice , 2001 ) . Much past theory and empirical work on varieties of capitalism has examined the impor - tant differences among national economies and their institutions , and the impact of these differ - ences on economies as a whole ( Hall & Soskice , 2001 ; Whitley , 1998 ) . This literature has gener - ally paid little attention to state ownership and generally not at the firm level , despite 104 February The Academy of Management Perspectives T A B LE 4 C E O s ’ B a c k g r o und 1 2 3 N D o n E l d e r — p r i v a t e i ndu s t r y N H e n r i P r o g li o — g ov e r n m e n t N I nd i a M i n i s t e r o f C o a l — g ov e r n m e n t T W illi a m G .

Giving additional attention to the state - owned sector and the range of organizational structures that have now developed , particularly at the firm level , will further add to the varieties of capitalism literature . We also empirically contribute to the SOE liter - ature by drawing on cases not only from China , but also from 22 other countries . Our more global ap - proach helps overcome the limited ( and often Chi - na - centric ) focus of the current SOE literature , in which 30 of 39 articles in the Financial Times top 45 journals were about Chinese SOEs . While Chi - nese SOEs deserve a great deal of research atten - tion , SOE research needs to broaden its radar screen to be globally relevant . SOEs are important in many countries , particularly the BRICs , and this research contributes to the understanding of these important economies . Specifically , we have em - phasized the importance of the objective function of state firms , where much past research has as - sumed that firms will be maximizers of profit ( Friedman , 1988 ) or of total market value ( Chris - tensen & Raynor , 2003 ) . This assumption is prob - lematic for SOEs that are charged with achieving alternative goals such as innovation , employment generation , or social stability in the face of financial downturns or other chaotic events . Much research on objective functions and related topics has appeared in finance and accounting , par - ticularly addressing the balanced scorecard ( Jen - sen , 2001 ; Johnson & Kaplan , 1987 ; Kaplan & Nor - ton , 1996 ) . In management and organizational research , debates center on the interests of various stakeholders ( Freeman , 1984 ) , the natural environ - ment as a primary goal for organizations ( Lovins , Lovins , & Hawken , 1999 ) , and other valued objec - tive functions ( Ahlstrom , 2010 ; Gedajlovic , Carney , Chrisman , & Kellermanns , 2012 ; Sharma et al . , 1997 ) . We have suggested additional objective functions and explored how firms and govern - ments are able to negotiate goals in the face of conflicting goals and aspirations . Different objec - tive functions , much like different assessment rou - tines in science and technology , can make a major impact in terms of firm management and direction ( Garud & Ahlstrom , 1997 ) . Future Research Directions This research has addressed transaction cost , agency , and institutional issues that can affect a range of SOEs in 23 countries . Future research should seek to build a richer and more nuanced understanding of SOEs around the world . The influence and power of the state have recently grown in several countries . Argentina , Bolivia , Bra - zil , Ecuador , Guatemala , Nicaragua , Paraguay , Peru , Uruguay , and Venezuela have all experienced a strengthened role of the state to varying degrees in their economies , albeit with mixed outcomes ( Economist , 2012b ) . This increase in the power of the state in many parts of Latin America contrasts with the pattern observed in Asia . Many Asian countries still hold SOEs to be important but have generally been reducing the state’s role in their economies in an absolute sense . Which institu - tional settings encourage these two approaches , and what are the implications for firms entering those markets ? We have also highlighted the issue of micro in - stitutions in this research . Institutions do affect the strategic opportunities and tools to which a firm has access . On the whole , examinations of institu - tions in this context have focused on macro insti - tutional concerns . The nature of how macro and micro institutional elements act to reinforce each other needs greater examination . The integration and alignment of the macro institutions would ap - pear to have performance implications . However , it is not clear what the impact of such misalignment would be . We would expect that it would reduce performance , although it may lead to an institu - tional change at the macro or micro level instead . Future research should explore this issue . Building on the research here , scholars should next compile a large database of hybrid SOEs and empirically explore the various issues highlighted in this study . In building the database scholars should focus on those SOEs that have a relatively permanent status as an SOE . For example , GM was an SOE in 2010 ( see Table 1 ) , but this was only a temporary designation , as it returned to private ownership in 2013 . Therefore , focusing on firms whose state status is relatively permanent would be useful . This database should also include informa - tion on the triple bottom line so that societal and environmental impacts are considered in addition to profits ( McWilliams & Siegel , 2001 ) . Research is needed on the various objective functions sought out by governments and their SOEs , how these firms are selected , and how this affects manage - ment and strategy . Finally , a rich set of measures should be employed . The financial data we relied on here was compiled by international accounting 106 February The Academy of Management Perspectives firms , so its reliability is considered high . But we also recognize that because politics plays a key role in many SOEs there can be incentives to either overstate or understate performance . Therefore , in building a database of SOEs , scholars should in - clude rich sets of measures . A firm’s objective function is often in terms of its profitability and market value . However , other measures may be helpful , such as an innovation measure , including revenue from new products . A government - linked organization , such as a uni - versity , a hospital , or an infrastructure project , may also have objective functions that are very different from profits and market value . It may have been established by the government with different goals than profitability or measures of market value . A greater understanding of issues of objective functions , goals , and even proper definitions for state ownership and control will positively affect research on SOEs and help coun - tries understand how such organizations can play key economic and developmental roles ( Kowalski et al . , 2013 ) . This can also facilitate the study of how government - linked organizations can be more effective yet not at the expense of efficiency . This study provides avenues for future re - search on the links between SOE strategic deci - sions and policy preference of governments across different economies . For instance , guided by governmental planners , China’s SOEs have been actively seeking acquisition targets around the world , including in developed economies such as the United States and Australia . How - ever , little insight has been offered into the hy - brid nature of the dual institutional logics , which shape organizational market - based resource allo - cation decisions as well as command - based re - source allocation decisions , which can , for exam - ple , differ greatly across industry and region in China ( Hsueh , 2011 ) . In general , firms are embed - ded with country - level regulatory systems and institutional logics ( La Porta , Lopez - de - Silanes , & Shleifer , 1999 ) . The evolution of SOEs from the central - planning institutional logic to hybrid in - stitutional logics thus faces complicated and fun - damental organizational transformation chal - lenges that are worthy of scholarly attention . The examination of these challenges should include the impact of key stakeholders that may be par - ticularly relevant in countries with strong tradi - tions of SOEs , including the military and ruling parties . Such key stakeholders have historically been ignored by scholars as they examine emerg - ing economies and business . CONCLUSIONS Far from the stereotypical combination of high levels of state ownership and control , today’s SOEs are often hybrid organizations that have elements of state ownership and control on one hand and private participation in ownership and control on the other hand . Further , such SOEs exist in many industries and in many countries around the world . If management research endeavors to be more glob - ally and broadly relevant , we argue that scholars should devote additional attention to this impor - tant , adaptive , and enduring organizational form that generates approximately 10 % of global GDP and represents some of the world’s largest firms . Today’s SOEs are no longer “pure” SOEs . Instead , many are hybrid organizational forms that require more attention from both researchers and manag - ers . The research here lays a foundation for further examination of this important sector of many na - tional economies around the world . REFERENCES 7 Acemoglu , D . ( 2009 ) .
