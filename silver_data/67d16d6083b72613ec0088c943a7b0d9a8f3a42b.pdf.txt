ORIGINAL ARTICLE Chmp4c is required for stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments Eleni Petsalaki 1 & Maria Dandoulaki 1 & George Zachos 1 Received : 30 March 2018 / Revised : 21 June 2018 / Accepted : 26 June 2018 / Published online : 2 July 2018 # Springer - Verlag GmbH Germany , part of Springer Nature 2018 Abstract Formation of stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments is essential for accurate chromosome segregation in human cells and depends on the NDC80 complex . We recently showed that Chmp4c , an endosomal sorting complex required for transport protein involved in membrane remodelling , localises to prometaphase kinetochores and promotes cold - stable kinetochore microtubules , faithful chromosome alignment and segregation . In the present study , we show that Chmp4c associates with the NDC80 components Hec1 and Nuf2 and is required for optimal NDC80 stability and Hec1 - Nuf2 localisation to kinetochores in prometaphase . However , Chmp4c - depletion does not cause a gross disassembly of outer or inner kinetochore complexes . Conversely , Nuf2 is required for Chmp4c kinetochore targeting . Constitutive Chmp4c kinetochore tethering partially rescues cold - stable microtubule polymers in cells depleted of the endogenous Nuf2 , showing that Chmp4c also contributes to kinetochore - microtubule stability independently of regulating Hec1 and Nuf2 localisation . Chmp4c interacts with tubulin in cell extracts , and binds and bundles microtubules in vitro through its highly basic N - terminal region ( amino acids 1 – 77 ) . Furthermore , the N - terminal region of Chmp4c is required for cold - stable kinetochore microtubules and efficient chromosome alignment . We propose that Chmp4c promotes stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments by regulating Hec1 – Nuf2 localisation to kineto - chores in prometaphase and by binding to spindle microtubules . These results identify Chmp4c as a novel protein that regulates kinetochore - microtubule interactions to promote accurate chromosome segregation in human cells . Keywords Chmp4c . Microtubules .

ESCRT Introduction Successful chromosome segregation during cell division re - quires formation of stable attachments between kinetochores and spindle microtubules in human cells . Kinetochores are formed at the periphery of sister centromeres and the site of kinetochore assembly is specified by CENP - A , a modified histone H3 ( Perpelescu and Fukagawa 2011 ) . The inner kinet - ochore domain contains the constitutive centromere - associated network , a complex of proteins that links CENP - A - containing chromatin to the KMN protein network ( named for the KNL1 , MIS12 and NDC80 complexes ) within the outer kinetochore ( Maiato et al . 2004 ; Varma and Salmon 2012 ) . In turn , the outer kinetochore interacts with spindle microtubules and also mediates recruitment of spindle check - point proteins to delay anaphase onset in the presence of un - attached kinetochores ( Foley and Kapoor 2013 ) . Initial interactions between chromosomes and spindle mi - crotubules occur predominantly along the microtubule lattice and are mediated by motor proteins . These interactions mature into B end - on ^ attachments consisting of spindle microtubules embedded in the outer kinetochore , which depend on the NDC80 complex ( Foley and Kapoor 2013 ) . The NDC80 is a heterotetramer comprising the Spc24 – Spc25 proteins which anchor the complex into the kinetochore and the Hec1 – Nuf2 proteins , which interact with the spindle microtubules ( Alushin et al . 2010 ; Cheeseman et al . 2006 ; Ciferri et al . 2008 ; DeLuca et al . 2006 ) . Hec1 binds to microtubules through its calponin - homology domain and also through a positively charged N - terminus tail of approximately 80 amino acids in length ( Alushin et al . 2010 ; Ciferri et al . 2008 ; Sundin et al . 2011 ) . The Nuf2 protein does not directly bind to kinet - ochore microtubules ( Alushin et al . 2010 ; Sundin et al . 2011 ) ; Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s00412 - 018 - 0675 - 8 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . * George Zachos gzachos @ uoc . gr 1 Department of Biology , University of Crete , Vassilika Vouton , 70013 Heraklion , Greece Chromosoma ( 2018 ) 127 : 461 – 473 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s00412 - 018 - 0675 - 8 however , depletion of either Hec1 or Nuf2 by siRNA causes reduction of both proteins at kinetochores , unstable kinetochore - microtubule attachments and chromosome mis - alignment ( DeLuca et al . 2003 ; DeLuca et al . 2002 ; Sundin et al . 2011 ) . The Astrin - SKAP complex stabilises mature B end - on ^ attachments and Ska proteins facilitate kinetochore binding to depolymerising microtubules during chromosome movement ; however , the list of proteins that regulate kinetochore - microtubule attachments is likely incomplete ( Friese et al . 2016 ; Hanisch et al . 2006 ; Kern et al . 2017 ; Schmidt et al . 2012 ) . We recently showed that Chmp4c , a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machin - ery ( ESCRT ; Campsteijn et al . 2016 ; Hurley 2015 ) , local - ises to kinetochores in prometaphase but is reduced from kinetochores aligned at the metaphase plate ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . Chmp4c binds to the spindle checkpoint protein ZW10 and promotes localisation of the Rod - ZW10 - Zwilch ( RZZ ) and Mad1 – Mad2 complexes to unattached kinetochores . Furthermore , Chmp4c is required for timely mitotic progression , faithful chromosome alignment and segregation ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . In addition , Chmp4c promotes cold - stable kinetochore microtubules , optimal spindle and centromere length through unidentified mech - anisms ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . In the present study , we find that Chmp4c associates with Hec1 and Nuf2 and promotes Hec1 – Nuf2 kinetochore localisation in prometaphase . We also find that the N - terminal region of Chmp4c binds to microtubules and is required for proper kinetochore – mi - crotubule interactions and chromosome alignment . These results identify Chmp4c as a novel protein that promotes stable kinetochore – microtubule attachments . Results Chmp4c promotes Hec1 and Nuf2 kinetochore localisation Stable kinetochore – microtubule attachments depend on the NDC80 complex . Depletion of the endogenous Chmp4c by siRNA located in the 3 ′ - untranslated region ( siChmp4c ) re - duced localisation of Nuf2 or Hec1 to prometaphase kineto - chores by approximately 50 % compared with controls and this was not due to reduced total levels of Nuf2 or Hec1 proteins ( Fig . 1a – c ; Online Resource Fig . S1a , b ) . In cells expressing Nuf2 fused to GFP ( Nuf2 : GFP ) , Chmp4c - depletion also reduced Nuf2 : GFP kinetochore staining com - pared with controls ( Fig . 1d ) . However , Chmp4c - depleted and control cells exhibited similar total and kinetochore levels of Spc24 and Spc25 proteins ( Fig . 1e – g ; Online Resource Fig . S1c ) . Furthermore , Chmp4c - depletion did not impair localisation of Spc24 fused to GFP ( Spc24 : GFP ) to kinetochores ( Fig . 1h ) . Expression of Chmp4c : GFP which is resistant to siChmp4c - mediated degradation , but not GFP alone , rescued Hec1 kinetochore localisation after depletion of the endogenous Chmp4c compared with control cells ( Fig . 2a , b ; Online Resource Fig . S1a ) . Depletion of Chmp4c reduced the Spc24 - Nuf2 interaction by co - immunoprecipitation ( as judged by the Nuf2 / Spc24 signal ratio ) in cells enriched in mitosis by nocodazole treatment and shake - off compared with controls , and this interaction was rescued after expression of Chmp4c : GFP ( Fig . 2c ) . These results show that Chmp4c is required for optimal in - tegrity of the NDC80 complex . However , localisation of Knl1 , Mis12 and CENP - H ( a component of the constitutive centromere - associated network ) proteins at kinetochores in Chmp4c - deficient cells was similar to controls suggesting that Chmp4c - depletion does not cause a gross disassembly of the KMN or inner kinetochore complexes ( Fig . 2d ; Online Resource Fig . S1d - f ) . Depletion of Nuf2 by siRNA inside the 3 ′ - untranslated region ( siNuf2 ) diminished Chmp4c kineto - chore staining compared with control cells ( Fig . 2e , f ; Online Resource Fig . S1 g ) . Depletion of Spc24 also reduced Chmp4c and Nuf2 localisation to kinetochores compared with control cells ( Fig . 2e , f ; Online Resource Fig . S1 h , i ) , which is consistent with the Spc24 – Spc25 sub - complex be - ing required for kinetochore localisation of Hec1 – Nuf2 ( Bharadwaj et al . 2004 ; Ciferri et al . 2005 ) . These results suggest that Chmp4c and Hec1 – Nuf2 localise to kineto - chores in an interdependent manner in prometaphase cells . Chmp4c associates with Hec1 and Nuf2 To investigate a possible interaction of Chmp4c with Hec1 and Nuf2 , wild - type ( WT ) or truncated forms of Chmp4c fused to GST ( Fig . 3a , b ) were used in GST pull - down ex - periments . In mitosis - enriched cells , WT GST - Chmp4c pre - dominantly associated with a phosphatase - sensitive ( phosphorylated ) form of Nuf2 ( Fig . 3c ; Online Resource Fig . S1 g ) and the Chmp4c – Nuf2 interaction required the C - terminal ( amino acids 78 – 233 ) , but not the N - terminal ( amino acids 1 – 77 ) sequence of Chmp4c ( Fig . 3d ) . The N - terminal ( 1 – 77 ) region of Chmp4c contains 22 positively charged residues ( net 14 positive charges at neutral pH ) which , in terms of positive charges , is reminiscent of the Hec1 N - terminal tail ( amino acids 1 – 80 ) that contains 15 positively charged amino acids ( net 10 positive charges at neutral pH ) and binds spindle microtubules ( Miller et al . 2008 ) . The C - terminal Chmp4c ( 78 – 233 ) sequence contains hydrophobic residues and an amphipathic helix inside the amino acids 216 – 233 that interacts with the spindle check - point protein ZW10 ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . Further dividing the C - terminal Chmp4c ( 78 – 233 ) region into two fragments ( 78 – 163 and 164 – 233 amino acids ) abolished Nuf2 - binding ( Fig . 3e ) suggesting that the entire Chmp4c ( 78 – 233 ) region 462 Chromosoma ( 2018 ) 127 : 461 – 473 is required for interaction with Nuf2 or that the Nuf2 epitope was disrupted . Also , the endogenous Chmp4c co - precipitated with Nuf2 or Hec1 in mitosis - enriched cell extracts ( Fig . 3f , g ) , but not in untreated cell extracts ( Online Resource Fig .

These results suggest that Chmp4c is positioned at , or close to , the critical interface of microtubule attachment . However , purified Chmp4c did not bind to Nuf2 or Hec1 in vitro ( Online Resource Fig . S2b - d ) suggesting that in vivo interactions be - tween Chmp4c and Hec1 or Nuf2 require additional compo - nents or modifications , or that our recombinant protein ( s ) is / are not properly folded . Chmp4c directly contributes to kinetochore - microtubule stability To investigate whether Chmp4c directly stabilises kinetochore - microtubules and minimise phenotypic contribu - tions from perturbing Hec1 and Nuf2 localisation , we engineered constructs in which Nuf2 or Chmp4c are constitu - tively tethered to kinetochores by fusion to Mis12 and GFP ( Nuf2 : Mis12 : GFP or Chmp4c : Mis12 : GFP respectively ) .

S2e ) and exhib - ited similar localisation to kinetochores in cells depleted of the endogenous Chmp4c compared with controls ( Online Resource Fig . S2f - h ) . Stably attached kinetochore microtu - bules are resistant to depolymerisation by low temperatures ( Brinkley and Cartwright 1975 ; Sundin et al . 2011 ) . After depletion of the endogenous Chmp4c , expression of Nuf2 : Mis12 : GFP fully restored localisation of the Hec1 – Nuf2 complex to kinetochores as judged by Hec1 - staining ( Online Resource Fig . S3a , b ) . However , Nuf2 : Mis12 : GFP - expression only partially rescued cold - stable microtubule polymers in prometaphase compared with controls ( Fig . 4a , b ) suggesting that Chmp4c is required for optimal kinetochore - microtubule stability independently of Hec1 and Nuf2 . This was likely not due to some effect of the Mis12 : GFP tag because expression of Nuf2 : Mis12 : GFP fully restored cold - stable microtubule polymers in cells depleted of endogenous Nuf2 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Also , expression of Chmp4c : Mis12 : GFP partially rescued cold - stable microtu - bule polymers in cells depleted of the endogenous Chmp4c and Nuf2 ( Fig . 4c , d ) , despite an approximate 90 % reduction in Hec1 kinetochore staining in these cells compared with controls ( Online Resource Fig .

S3e , f ) . These results show that Chmp4c promotes formation of stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments independently of regulating Hec1 and Nuf2 localisation . Chmp4c binds and bundles microtubules To investigate whether Chmp4c associates with tubulin , cells were enriched in prometaphase with an intact mitotic spindle . For this purpose , cells were treated with 300 nM nocodazole for 16 h , incubated with ice - cold medium for 1 . 5 h to completely depolymerise spindle microtubules and released into warm medium for 15 min to allow spindle formation ( nocodazole and B release ^ protocol ; Online Resource Fig . S4a ) . Afterwards , cells were lysed in ice - cold buffer that causes complete disassembly of microtubules .

S4b ) .

S4d ) . Purified His - Chmp4c did not significantly alter the percentage of GST - Hec1 bound to microtubules in vitro ( Online Resource Fig . S4e - g ) . GST - Chmp4c also bundled microtubules in vitro and , for 1 μ M tubulin , an approximately equal concentration of WT Chmp4c was required to observe robust bundling ( Fig . 5g ) . Microtubule bundling and binding activities re - quired the N - terminal ( 1 – 77 amino acids ) , but not the C - terminal ( 78 – 233 ) region , of Chmp4c ( Fig . 5g – i ) and Chmp4c ( 1 – 77 ) fused to GFP associated with spindle micro - tubules in mitotic cells ( Online Resource Fig . S4 h ) . We con - clude that Chmp4c directly binds and bundles microtubules in vitro . The N - terminal ( 1 – 77 ) region of Chmp4c is required for stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments To investigate whether the in vitro microtubule binding activ - ity of Chmp4c has functional relevance at the kinetochore , cells expressing truncated Chmp4c ( 78 – 233 ) fused to GFP ( lacking the 1 – 77 amino acids microtubule binding domain of Chmp4c ) were depleted of the endogenous Chmp4c by siRNA and treated with ice - cold medium for 15 min . These cells exhibited reduced cold - stable microtubule polymers in prometaphase ( Fig . 6a , b ) and increased chromosome mis - alignment in metaphase in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Fig . 6c , d ) , compared with cells expressing WT Chmp4c : GFP . However , expression of Chmp4c ( 78 – 233 ) : GFP rescued ZW10 - kinetochore localisation after deple - tion of the endogenous Chmp4c compared with GFP only ( Online Resource Fig . S4i ; Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . These results suggest that the N - terminal ( amino acids 1 – 77 ) sequence of Chmp4c is required for optimal kinetochore - microtubule at - tachments and chromosome alignment . Discussion On the basis of those findings , we propose that the ESCRT protein Chmp4c localises to prometaphase kinetochores and promotes stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments by di - rectly binding to spindle microtubules and stabilising the Hec1 – Nuf2 kinetochore complex . We also propose that Chmp4c links kinetochore - microtubule attachment with spin - dle checkpoint signalling : In prometaphase , Chmp4c localises to unattached kinetochores , where it promotes kinetochore - microtubule interactions and RZZ - kinetochore targeting ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . In metaphase , when stable kinetochore - microtubule attachments are formed , Chmp4c dissociates from kinetochores leading to dynein - dependent stripping of RZZ and Mad1 – Mad2 , and spindle - checkpoint silencing . Ska1 binds to kinetochores following microtubule attach - ment and facilitates kinetochore binding to depolymerising microtubules during chromosome movement ( Hanisch et al . 2006 ; Schmidt et al . 2012 ) . Also , the Astrin - SKAP complex localises to properly bi - oriented sister kinetochores and stabilises correctly formed kinetochore - microtubule attach - ments ( Friese et al . 2016 ; Kern et al . 2017 ) . Because Chmp4c localises to unattached kinetochores and unaligned chromosomes but is reduced from kinetochores aligned at the metaphase plate ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) , perhaps Chmp4c fa - cilitates kinetochore - microtubule interactions before mature kinetochore attachments are formed . Purified GST - Chmp4c exhibits relatively high microtubule binding affinity in vitro ; however , our analysis may be limited by the GST tag . Future experiments using GST - cleaved Chmp4c and a reconstituted Ndc80 complex are required to more accurately assess the relative affinity of Chmp4c and Ndc80 for binding microtubules . We also show that Chmp4c is required for the integrity of the NDC80 complex in prometaphase . This was perhaps unexpect - ed because the NDC80 is stable in vitro and can be reconstituted by expression of its individual subunits in bacteria ( Cheeseman et al . 2006 ; Ciferri et al . 2005 ; Wei et al . 2005 ) . However , additional proteins may be required for optimal NDC80 stability in cultured cells . The Spc24 – Spc25 and Hec1 – Nuf2 dimers are held together by overlapping α - helical coiled coil domains located at the C - terminus of the Hec1 – Nuf2 dimer and the N - terminus of the Spc24 – Spc25 dimer ( Ciferri et al . 2005 ; Varma and Salmon 2012 ; Wei et al . 2005 ) . One pos - sibility is that Chmp4c ( or an unidentified Chmp4c - interacting protein ) binds at the interface of the Hec1 – Nuf2 and Spc24 – Spc25 heterodimers to stabilise the NDC80 heterotetramer . Interestingly , recent structural work on the B dwarf ^ NDC80 complex suggested that unknown cellular factors might bind at this interface and Chmp4c might be ( or recruit ) such a mol - ecule ( Valverde et al . 2016 ) . However , Chmp4c is not required for NDC80 assembly in metaphase as Hec1 – Nuf2 levels are not reduced after evacuation of Chmp4c from kinetochores in con - trol cells . One possibility is that a different protein stabilises the NDC80 complex in metaphase after Chmp4c is dissociated from kinetochores . Alternatively , binding of kinetochore micro - tubules may stabilise the NDC80 complex in metaphase in the absence of Chmp4c . Chmp4c - deficient cells can still align the majority of their chromosomes despite an approximate 50 % reduction in Hec1 – Nuf2 kinetochore localisation . Vertebrate kinetochores have excess copies of NDC80 complexes : there are approxi - mately 14 NDC80 complexes per kinetochore microtubule in human cells and 30 NDC80 complexes per kinetochore mi - crotubule in Xenopus , compared with just 8 NDC80 com - plexes per microtubule binding site in budding yeast ( Emanuele et al . 2005 ; Joglekar et al . 2006 ; Suzuki et al . 2015 ) . Presumably , the remaining Hec1 – Nuf2 molecules in 468 Chromosoma ( 2018 ) 127 : 461 – 473 Chmp4c - deficient cells can still establish the majority of kinetochore - microtubule contacts , but this leads to delayed anaphase onset , misaligned and missegregated chromosomes ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) . In conclusion , our study identifies a novel protein that regulates kinetochore - microtubule attach - ments to promote accurate chromosome segregation in human cells .

For pET28 / hChmp4c vector encoding His - tagged human Chmp4c , full length Chmp4c cDNA was amplified by PCR using pCR3 . 1 GFP - EXN / chmp4c as template and cloned into the pET28a ( + ) vector ( EMD Millipore ) with XhoI / EcoRI . To generate pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 / hChmp4c coding for N - terminal fusion of wild - type human Chmp4c to GFP : Mis12 ( amino acids 1 – 205 of human Mis12 ) , Chmp4c sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 vector ( a gift from Geert Kops , University Medical Centre Utrecht , Utrecht , the Netherlands ) as XhoI / EcoRI fragments . Plasmids pEGFP N1 / Nuf2 and pEGFP N1 / Hec1 coding for C - terminal fusions of human Nuf2 or Hec1 to GFP were from Jennifer DeLuca ( University of California , Santa Barbara , USA ) . Plasmid pEGFP / Spc24 coding for N - terminal fusion of human Spc24 to GFP was made by cloning the Spc24 cDNA into the pcDNA3 . 1 + N - eGFP vector with KpnI / BamHI ( Genscript ) . To generate pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 / hNuf2 plasmid , human Nuf2 was PCR - amplified from the pEGFP N1 / Nuf2 vector and cloned into pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 with XhoI / EcoRV . For pGEX4T1 / hNuf2 coding for full length GST - tagged human Nuf2 , the Nuf2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using pEGFP N1 / Nuf2 as template and cloned into the pGEX4T1 vector with BamHI / XhoI . Also , to make pGEX4T1 / hHec1 coding for full length GST - tagged hu - man Hec1 , the Hec1 cDNAwas amplified by PCR using pEGFP N1 / Hec1 as template and inserted into pGEX4T1 vector with XhoI . To make the pGFP / Chmp4c ( 1 – 77 ) vector coding for N - terminal fusion of human Chmp4c ( 1 – 77 ) to GFP , we excised Mis12 ( amino acids 1 – 205 of human Mis12 ) from the pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 / hChmp4c ( 1 – 77 ) plasmid ( please see below ) with NotI / XhoI and filled in the 5 ′ overhangs with T4 DNA poly - merase ( New England Biolabs ) . The pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 / hChmp4c ( 1 – 77 ) plasmid ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) was made by amplifying the Chmp4c cDNA sequence by PCR and cloning it into the pcDNA4 / GFP / Mis12 vector with XhoI / EcoRI . All plas - mids were completely sequenced . siRNA sequences Negative siRNA ( a pool of four different siRNAs : U A A G G C U A U G A A G A G A U A C , A U G U A U U G G C C U G U A U U A G , A U G A A C G U G A A U U G C U C A A , UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA ) were from Thermo Scientific . Human Chmp4c siRNA , previously described as Chmp4c - 2 ( Petsalaki et al . 2018 ) , located in the 3 ′ - untranslat - ed region ( GUAGAGGAGUCUUAUAUGA ) , Nuf2 siRNA located in the 3 ′ - untranslated region ( GAAGCGAA UGGAAGUAUCA ) and Spc24 siRNA ( a pool of three dif - ferent siRNAs : UCACCAUGGAGAAGGAAGU , C A A C U U U A C C A C C A A G U U A , C U C U C C A G GAAAUUCAUCA ) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Only the sense sequences of the siRNA duplexes are shown and all sequences are provided in 5 ′ → 3 ′ orientation . Bacteria culture and protein purification BL21 ( DE3 ) cells ( Agilent Technologies ) were grown in 100 – 200 ml LB Broth ( 1 % w / v tryptone , 0 . 5 % w / v yeast extract , 171 mM NaCl ) supplemented with the appropriate selection antibiotic . At OD600 = 0 . 5 , cells were induced with 0 . 1 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at 16 °C for 16 – 18 h . Afterwards , cells were spun down at 1000 g for 10 min and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml NETN ( 20 mM Tris pH = 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 ) for every 100 ml of culture . The suspension was son - icated for 3 × 10 s and cleared by centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 10 min to produce the supernatant ( crude extract ) containing the GST fusion protein . To prepare GST fusion protein bound to glutathione agarose beads , 150 μ l glutathione agarose slur - ry ( sc - 2009 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was added for every 3 ml crude extract , mixed for 1 h at 4 °C using a spiramix , beads were spun down at 1000 g for 5 min , washed × 3with 500 μ l NETN and an equal volume of NETN ( 150 μ l ) was added . GST proteins on glutathione agarose beads were stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week . To prepare GST proteins eluted from beads , GST proteins were isolated from the crude extract using the GST spintrap purification module ( # 28 - 9523 - 59 , GE Healthcare ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions , aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C . His - tagged human Chmp4c was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells as above and purified using the His - Bind purification kit ( # 70239 - 3 , Millipore ) fol - lowing the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Eluted His - Chmp4c was dialysed in dialysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH = 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mM EGTA pH = 8 . 0 ) using Pur - A - lyzer 6000 dialysis tubes ( PURX60015 , Sigma ) , aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C . Cell culture and treatments Human colon carcinoma BE cells and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were grown in DMEM ( Gibco ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 and treated with 3 . 32 μ M or 300 nM nocodazole ( Applichem ) , or 10 μ g / ml MG132 ( Calbiochem ) as appropriate . siRNAs or GFP pro - teins were transfected into cells 24 h before analysis or drug treatment using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . Experiments were generally performed in BE cells unless oth - erwise stated . Transient expression of GFP - tagged proteins was relatively more uniform in HeLa compared with BE cells ; 470 Chromosoma ( 2018 ) 127 : 461 – 473 therefore , most rescue experiments were performed in HeLa cells as specified and cells exhibiting relatively low GFP ki - netochore levels were analysed by fluorescence microscopy . All cell lines used exhibited consistent morphology and growth properties and were negative for mycoplasma contamination . Enrichment of cells in mitosis ( nocodazole and B shake - off ^ ) Cells were treated with 3 . 32 μΜ nocodazole for 16 h and mitotic cells isolated by B shake - off ^ . Microscopic examina - tion had shown approximately 70 – 80 % of cells were in prometaphase after this treatment compared with 2 – 3 % in untreated cells . Enrichment of cells in prometaphase with an intact mitotic spindle ( nocodazole and B release ^ ) BE cells were treated with 300 nM nocodazole for 16 h , in - cubated with ice - cold - medium for 1 . 5 h to completely depolymerise spindle microtubules and released into warm medium for 15 min to allow spindle re - formation . Microscopic examination had shown approximately 55 % of cells were in prometaphase after the 15 - min release and ex - hibited a fully formed mitotic spindle ( as judged by spindle morphology and the amount of α - tubulin incorporated in the mitotic spindle ) compared with approximately 2 % in untreat - ed cells . Afterwards , cells were lysed in ice - cold immunoprecipitation / kinase buffer as described further below . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy For Chmp4c , Nuf2 , Spc24 , Spc25 , Knl1 , Mis12 , CENP - A or CENP - H staining , cells were fixed in ice - cold methanol for 5 min at − 20 °C , washed twice with PBS at room temperature , and immunostained . For ZW10 , Hec1 , α - tubulin or GFP staining , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in cytoskel - eton buffer ( 1 . 1 M Na 2 HPO 4 , 0 . 4 M KH 2 PO 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 5 mM Pipes , and 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 1 ) for 5 min at 37 °C , permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer , washed twice with PBS at room temperature , and immunostained . FITC - or rhodamine - TRITC – conjugated secondary anti - bodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) were used as appropriate . DNA was stained with 10 μ M TO - PRO - 3 iodide ( 642 / 661 nm ; Invitrogen ) and cells were mounted in Vectashield medium ( Vector Laboratories ) . Images were collected using a laser - scanning spectral confo - cal microscope ( TCS SP2 ; Leica ) , LCS Lite software ( Leica ) and a 63 Χ Apochromat 1 . 40 NA oil objective . The low fluo - rescence immersion oil ( 11513859 ; Leica ) was used , and im - aging was performed at room temperature . Average projections of image stacks were obtained using the LCS Lite software . To analyse fluorescence intensities , background readings were subtracted and green / red fluorescence intensities quanti - fied using LCS Lite . For tubulin fluorescence intensities ( cold assays ) , background readings were subtracted and total tubulin - associated fluorescence for each mitotic cell was quantified by analysing an equal image area using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) . Cold - induced microtubule depolymerisation To induce microtubule disassembly of non - kinetochore mi - crotubules , cell media was replaced with ice - cold media and cells were incubated on ice for 15 min . Subsequently , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer , permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , stained for α - tubulin and prometaphase cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy . In vitro microtubule polymerisation Microtubules were assembled from rhodamine - labelled tubu - lin ( TL590M - A , Cytoskeleton ) at 37 °C for 30 min in BRB80 buffer ( 80 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 9 , 8 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM GTP ) and stabilised with 20 mM taxol ( Applichem ) for 5 min according to manufacturer ’ s instructions . Microtubule pull - down , co - sedimentation and bundling assays For microtubule pull - down assays , 0 – 5 μ M of taxol - stabilised microtubules were incubated with 0 . 5 μ g GST - Chmp4c or 1 μ g GST on glutathione agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) in BRB80 buffer at room temperature for 1 h , in 20 μ l final volume . The beads were then washed three times with BRB80 buffer , boiled and analysed by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . For microtubule co - sedimentation assays , 0 . 5 μ g GST - Chmp4c ( = 0 . 5 μ M , approximately ) , 1 μ g GST ( = 2 μ M ) , 0 . 6 μ g GST - Hec1 ( = 0 . 3 μ M ) eluted from beads or 250 – 350 ng purified His - Chmp4c ( = 0 . 5 – 0 . 65 μ M ) were incubated with 0 – 2 μ M taxol - stabilised microtubules in BRB80 buffer at room temperature for 1 h , in 20 μ l final volume . The samples were then centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 1 . 5 h at 30 °C . The supernatant and pellet were boiled and separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . In Figs 5f and S4 g , the percentage ( x ) of GST - Chmp4c ( or GST - Hec1 ) bound to mi - crotubules for every microtubule concentration was calculated as follows : x = [ p / ( s + p ) ] × 100 % , where ( s ) and ( p ) are the intensities of the GST - Chmp4c ( or GST - Hec1 ) bands in the supernatant and microtubule pellet fractions , respectively . Chromosoma ( 2018 ) 127 : 461 – 473 471 For microtubule bundling assays , 1 μ M taxol - stabilised microtubules was incubated with 0 – 1 μ M GST - Chmp4c in BRB80 buffer at room temperature for 15 min , in 20 μ l final volume . Then , 5 μ l were squashed in coverslips and observed by fluorescence microscopy . Protein co - immunoprecipitations , GST pull - downs and in vitro binding assays Cells were sonicated three times for 10 s in ice - cold immunoprecipitation / kinase buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 2 . 5 mM EGTA , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 10 μ g / ml leupeptin , 10 μ g / ml aprotinin , 1 mM sodium fluoride , 10 mM sodium β - glycerophosphate and 0 . 1 mM sodium vanadate ) and incubat - ed for further 30 min on ice . For co - immunoprecipitations , 1 mg cell lysate was incubated with 1 μ g antibody for 16 h followed by addition of 10 μ l protein A / G PLUS – agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C . For GST pull - downs or in vitro binding assays , 0 . 5 mg cell lysate or 0 . 5 μ g purified His - Chmp4c respectively , was incubated with 1 μ g GST protein on gluta - thione agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C . Samples were spun down , washed three times with immunoprecipitation / kinase buffer and immunoprecipitated proteins on agarose beads analysed by SDS - PAGE . Western blotting and phosphatase treatment Cells were lysed in ice - cold whole cell extract buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , 5 mM EDTA , 10 mM EGTA , 0 . 4 M KCl , 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol , 5 mM NaF , 1 mM DTT , 5 μ g / ml leupeptin , 50 μ g / ml PMSF , 1 mM benzamidine , 5 μ g / ml aprotinin and 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) for 30 min on ice . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g for 10 min , analysed by SDS - PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . For phosphatase assays , cells were lysed in whole cell extract buffer without phosphatase inhibitors and 30 μ g cell extracts were incubated with 800 units lamda phosphatase ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , for 30 min at 30 °C prior to analysis by SDS - PAGE . Densitometry Densitometric analysis of bands was performed using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) . Statistical analysis For kinetochore fluorescence , several kinetochore pairs per cell from a minimum of five cells per experiment from at least two independent experiments were analysed per treatment and standard deviation ( s . d . ) was calculated . For tubulin fluores - cence , 30 cells per experiment from three independent experiments were analysed for each treatment and s . d . was calculated . For chromosome misalignment , s . d . from the mean from three independent experiments was calculated and at least 20 cells per experiment and per treatment were analysed . Statistically significant differences between two groups were calculated using the Student ’ s t test . Statistically significant differences between three or more groups ( Figs . 2b , f , 4b , d , 6b , d and S3d , f ) were determined by one - way ANOVA followed by the Student ’ s t test between two groups . No sta - tistical method was used to predetermine sample size .
