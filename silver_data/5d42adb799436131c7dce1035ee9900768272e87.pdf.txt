Reasoning by analogy is an important component of common sense reasoning whose formalization has undergone recent improvements with the logical and algebraic study of the analogical proportion . The starting point of this study considers analogical proportions on a formal context . We introduce analogical complexes , a companion of formal con - cepts formed by using analogy between four subsets of objects in place of the initial binary relation . They represent subsets of objects and at - tributes that share a maximal analogical relation . We show that the set of all complexes can be structured in an analogical complex lattice and give explicit formulae for the computation of their inﬁmum and supremum . Keywords : analogical reasoning , analogical proportion , formal concept , analogical complex , lattice of analogical complexes 1 Introduction Analogical reasoning [ 4 ] plays an important role in human reasoning . It en - ables us to draw plausible conclusions by exploiting parallels between situations , and as such has been studied in AI for a long time , e . g . , [ 5 , 9 ] under various approaches [ 3 ] . A key pattern which is associated with the idea of analogical reasoning is the notion of analogical proportion ( AP ) , i . e . a statement between two pairs ( A , B ) and ( C , D ) of the form ‘ A is to B as C is to D ’ where all elements A , B , C , D are in a same category . However , it is only in the last decade that researchers working in computa - tional linguistics have started to study these proportions in a formal way [ 6 , 17 , 19 ] . More recently , analogical proportions have been shown as being of particu - lar interest for classiﬁcation tasks [ 10 ] or for solving IQ tests [ 2 ] . Moreover , in the last ﬁve years , there has been a number of works , e . g . , [ 11 , 15 ] studying the propositional logic modeling of analogical proportions . In all previous cases , the ability to work on the set of all possible analogical proportions is required , either for checking missing objects or attributes or for making informed recommendations or more generally ensuring the completeness and eﬃciency of reasoning . In practice the analysis of objects composed of binary attributes , such as those studied by Formal Concept Analysis , is an important and easy context where AP are used . The question is whether it is possible to obtain a good representation of the space of all AP by applying the principles of c (cid:13) Sadok Ben Yahia , Jan Konecny ( Eds . ) : CLA 2015 , pp . 159 – 170 , ISBN 978 – 2 – 9544948 – 0 – 7 , ISSN 2311 – 701X , Blaise Pascal University , LIMOS laboratory , Clermont - Ferrand , 2015 . FCA . A heuristic algorithm to discover such proportions by inspecting a lattice of formal concepts has been proposed in [ 14 ] . Moreover , a deﬁnition of an analogical proportion between formal concepts has been given in [ 13 ] , as a particular case of proportions between elements of a lattice , studied also in [ 18 ] . In this paper , we are interested in a slightly diﬀerent task involving a more integrated view of concept categorization and analogy : looking for the structure of the space of all AP . Our goal is to build an extension of formal concepts con - sidering the presence of analogical proportions as the funding relation instead of the initial binary relation between objects and attributes . We call this ex - tension analogical complexes , which isolate subcontexts in formal contexts with a certain structure reﬂecting the existence of a maximal analogical proportion between subsets of objects and subsets of attributes . 2 Basics on Analogical Proportion Deﬁnition 1 ( Analogical proportion [ 7 , 12 ] ) . An analogical proportion ( AP ) on a set X is a quaternary relation on X , i . e . a subset of X 4 whose elements ( x , y , z , t ) , written x : y : : z : t , which reads ’x is to y as z is to t’ , must obey the following two axioms : 1 . Symmetry of ’as’ : x : y : : z : t ⇔ z : t : : x : y 2 . Exchange of means : x : y : : z : t ⇔ x : z : : y : t In case of formal contexts , objects are described by boolean attributes . An AP ( x , y , z , t ) between four Boolean variables exists if the following formula is true : ( x ∧ ¬ y ) ⇔ ( z ∧ ¬ t ) and ( y ∧ ¬ x ) ⇔ ( t ∧ ¬ z ) Basically , the formula expresses that the dissimilarity observed between x and y is the same as the dissimilarity between z and t . An equivalent formula is x 6 = y ⇔ ( x = z ∧ y = t ) and x = y ⇔ z = t It has 6 models of Boolean 4 - tuples among the 16 possible ones . Note that this includes the trivial cases where x = y = z = t . Since we are only interested in this paper in non trivial analogical proportions , we further require that x 6 = t and y 6 = z . This reduces the number of possible Boolean 4 - tuples in AP to four and it leads to the notion of analogical schema that we will use for the deﬁnition of analogical complexes . Deﬁnition 2 ( Analogical schema ) . The binary matrix AS =   0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0   is called an analogical schema . We write AS ( i , j ) if the value at row i and column j of matrix AS is 1 ( e . g . AS ( 1 , 3 ) and AS ( 1 , 4 ) ) . 160 Laurent Miclet and Jacques Nicolas The analogical schema may be seen as a formal context on four objects o 1 , o 2 , o 3 , o 4 that are in the non - trivial AP : o 1 : o 2 : : o 3 : o 4 . The ﬁgure 1 shows the associated concept lattice . In this lattice , A ∧ D = B ∧ C and A ∨ D = B ∨ C . The ﬁgure also give names for each column and row proﬁles that we call object and attribute types : for instance the ﬁrst column as type 1 and the second row as type b . { a } { b } { c } { d } { 3 } { 4 } { 1 } { 2 } 1 2 3 4 a ×× b × × c × × d ×× AB AC BD CD A B C D > ⊥ Fig . 1 .

Forsyth [ 8 ] for illustra - tion purpose . We call smallzoo the formal context extracted from this database corresponding to attributes 2 to 9 and to the objects corresponding to the two largest classes 1 and 2 . Moreover , this context has been clariﬁed and we have chosen arbitrarily one object for each of the 10 diﬀerent types of objects with diﬀerent attribute proﬁles . The corresponding table is given below . smallzoo 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 18 hair feathers eggs milk airborne aquatic predator toothed type 1 aardvark 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 12 chicken 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 2 17 crow 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 20 dolphin 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 22 duck 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 2 28 fruitbat 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 42 kiwi 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 2 49 mink 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 59 penguin 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 64 platypus 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 From formal concepts to analogical complexes 161 The formal concept lattice is provided in ﬁgure 2 , as computed by FCA Extension [ 16 ] . It contains 31 elements . The central elements ( at least two objects and two attributes ) are listed below : c ( 3 ) (cid:0) { 20 ; 49 ; 59 ; 64 } , { 7 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 7 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 20 ; 49 ; 64 } , { 5 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 9 ) (cid:0) { 20 ; 49 ; 64 } , { 5 ; 7 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 12 ) (cid:0) { 17 ; 42 ; 59 ; 64 } , { 4 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 14 ) (cid:0) { 59 ; 64 } , { 4 ; 7 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 16 ) (cid:0) { 17 ; 42 ; 59 } , { 3 ; 4 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 19 ) (cid:0) { 12 ; 17 ; 22 } , { 3 ; 4 ; 6 } (cid:1) c ( 23 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 28 ; 49 } , { 2 ; 5 ; 9 } (cid:1) c ( 25 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 49 } , { 2 ; 5 ; 8 ; 9 } (cid:1) c ( 6 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 20 ; 28 ; 49 } , { 5 ; 9 } (cid:1) c ( 8 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 20 ; 49 } , { 5 ; 8 ; 9 } (cid:1) c ( 10 ) (cid:0) { 20 ; 49 } , { 5 ; 7 ; 8 ; 9 } (cid:1) c ( 13 ) (cid:0) { 22 ; 59 ; 64 } , { 4 ; 7 } (cid:1) c ( 15 ) (cid:0) { 12 ; 17 ; 22 ; 42 ; 59 } , { 3 ; 4 } (cid:1) c ( 17 ) (cid:0) { 22 ; 59 } , { 3 ; 4 ; 7 } (cid:1) c ( 22 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 28 ; 49 ; 64 } , { 2 ; 5 } (cid:1) c ( 24 ) (cid:0) { 1 ; 49 ; 64 } , { 2 ; 5 ; 8 } (cid:1) c ( 26 ) (cid:0) { 49 ; 64 } , { 2 ; 5 ; 7 ; 8 } (cid:1) Example 1 . If one extracts in smallzoo the subcontext crossing ( 12 , 28 , 59 , 49 ) - that is , ( chicken , fruitbat , penguin , mink ) - and ( 7 , 2 , 3 , 6 ) - ( aquatic , hair , feathers , airborne ) - , it is clearly an analogical schema . The 4 - tuple ( chicken : fruitbat : : penguin : mink ) is an analogical proportion that ﬁnds a support using attributes ( aquatic , hair , feathers , airborne ) . Each attribute reﬂects one of the four possible types of Boolean analogy . For instance , hair is false for chicken and penguin and true for fruitbat and mink whereas feathers is true for chicken and penguin and false for fruitbat and mink . The observed analogy can be explained thanks to this typology : the dissimilarity between chicken and fruitbat based on the opposition feather / hair is the same as the dissimilarity between penguin and mink and there are two other opposite attributes , airborne and aquatic , that explain the similarity within each ’is to’ relation . Note that the analogical schema if fully symmetric and thus one could also in principle write AP between attributes : hair : feathers : : aquatic : airborne . 3 An analogical complex is to an analogical proportion as a concept is to a binary relation 3 . 1 Analogical complexes A formal concept on a context ( X , Y , I ) is a maximal subcontext for which relation I is valid . We deﬁne analogical complexes in the same way : they are maximal subcontexts for which the 4 - tuples are in AP . This requires to split objects and attributes in four classes . Deﬁnition 3 ( Analogical complex ) . Given a formal context ( X , Y , I ) , a set of objects O ⊆ X , O = O 1 ∪ O 2 ∪ O 3 ∪ O 4 , a set of attributes A ⊆ Y , A = A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪ A 3 ∪ A 4 , and a binary relation I , the subcontext ( O , A ) forms an analogical complex ( O 1 , 4 , A 1 , 4 ) iﬀ 162 Laurent Miclet and Jacques Nicolas Fig . 2 . Formal concept lattice of formal context smallzoo . Drawing from Concept Ex - plorer [ 20 ] . 1 . The binary relation is compatible with the analogical schema AS : ∀ o ∈ O i , i = 1 . . 4 , ∀ a ∈ A j , j = 1 . . 4 , I ( o , a ) ⇔ AS ( i , j ) . 2 . The context is maximal with respect to the ﬁrst property ( ⊕ denotes the ex - clusive or and \ the set - theoretic diﬀerence ) : ∀ o ∈ X \ O , ∃ j ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] , ∃ a ∈ A j , I ( o , a ) ⊕ AS ( i , j ) . ∀ a ∈ Y \ A , ∃ i ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] , ∃ o ∈ O i , I ( o , a ) ⊕ AS ( i , j ) . The ﬁrst property states that the value of an attribute for an object in a com - plex is a function of object type and attribute type ( integer from 1 to 4 ) given by the analogical schema . The second property states that adding an object ( resp . an attribute ) to the complex would discard the ﬁrst property for at least one attribute ( resp . object ) value . Note that the ways analogical schema or analogi - cal complex are deﬁned are completely symmetric . Thus the role of objects and attributes may be interchanged in all properties on analogical complexes . From formal concepts to analogical complexes 163 Example 2 . We extract two subcontexts from smallzoo , highlighting analogical schemas by sorting rows and columns . A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 a 7 a 8 a 2 a 5 a 9 a 3 a 4 a 6 O 1 o 12 ( chicken ) 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 O 2 o 28 ( fruitbat ) 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 O 3 o 59 ( penguin ) 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 O 4 o 49 ( mink ) 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 a 7 a 6 O 1 o 12 0 1 o 17 0 1 o 28 0 1 O 2 o 12 0 1 o 17 0 1 o 28 0 1 O 3 o 20 1 0 o 49 1 0 o 59 1 0 o 64 1 0 O 4 o 20 1 0 o 49 1 0 o 59 1 0 o 64 1 0 These subcontexts are maximal in the sense that it is not possible to add an object or an attribute without breaking the analogical proportion . They are associated to the following analogical complexes : (cid:0) ( { 12 } , { 28 } , { 59 } , { 49 } ) , ( { 7 , 8 } , { 2 , 5 , 9 } , { 3 , 4 } , { 6 } ) (cid:1) (cid:0) ( { 12 , 17 , 28 } , { 12 , 17 , 28 } , { 20 , 49 , 59 , 64 } , { 20 , 49 , 59 , 64 } ) , ( { 7 } , ∅ , ∅ , { 6 } ) (cid:1) The ﬁrst example provides a strong analogical relation between four animals in the context smallzoo since it uses all attributes and all the types of analogy . Attribute clusters correspond to aquatic predators , toothed animals with hair and milk , birds ( feathers and eggs ) and ﬂying animals ( airborne ) . The second example shows some of the sets in analogical complexes can be empty . In such a case some sets may be duplicated . Among all complexes , those that exhibit all types of analogy are particularly meaningful : we call them complete complexes . 3 . 2 Complete analogical complexes ( CAC ) Deﬁnition 4 . A complex C = ( O 1 , 4 , A 1 , 4 ) is complete if none of its eight sets are empty . By construction , if CA = ( O 1 , 4 , A 1 , 4 ) is a complete analogical complex and if A = S i = 1 , 4 A i , the following formula holds : ∀ ( o 1 , o 2 , o 3 , o 4 ) ∈ O 1 , 4 , ∀ ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 ) ∈ A 1 , 4 ( o ↑ 1 ∩ o ↑ 4 ) ∩ A = ( o ↑ 2 ∩ o ↑ 3 ) ∩ A = ∅ and o ↑ 1 ∪ o ↑ 4 = o ↑ 2 ∩ o ↑ 3 = A 164 Laurent Miclet and Jacques Nicolas The next proposition shows that CAC exhibits strong discrimination and sim - ilarity properties among pairs of objects and attributes . The similarity condition alone would lead to the concatenation of independent ( non overlapping ) formal concepts . The discrimination condition tempers this tendency by requiring the simultaneous presence of opposite pairs . Proposition 1 . Let us deﬁne on a formal context FC = ( X , Y , I ) the relations : discrimination ( o i , o j , a k , a l ) = I ( o i , a k ) ∧ I ( o j , a l ) ∧ ¬ I ( o i , a l ) ∧ ¬ I ( o j , a k ) . similarity ( o i , o j , a k , a l ) = I ( o i , a k ) ∧ I ( o j , a k ) ∧ I ( o i , a l ) ∧ I ( o j , a l ) . A complete analogical complex ( O 1 , 4 , A 1 , 4 ) in FC corresponds to a maximal subcontext such that : 1 . object pair discrimination ( resp . similarity ) : ∀ ( o i , o j ) ∈ O i × O j , i 6 = j , ∃ ( a k , a l ) ∈ A k × A l such that discrimination ( o i , o j , a k , a l ) ( resp . similarity ( o i , o j , a k , a l ) ) ; 2 . attribute pair discrimination ( res . similarity ) : ∀ ( a k , a l ) ∈ A k × A l , k 6 = l , ∃ ( o i , o j ) ∈ O i × O j such that discrimination ( o i , o j , a k , a l ) ( resp . similarity ( o i , o j , a k , a l ) ) . Proof . Since objects and attribute have a completely symmetrical role , it is suﬃ - cient to prove the proposition for object pairs . It proceeds easily by enumerating the possible type pairs with diﬀerent elements . If objects have type 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 , attributes allowing object pair discrimination have type b and c and attributes allowing object pair similarity have type a and d . If objects have type 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 , attributes allowing object pair discrimination have type a and d and attributes allowing object pair similarity have type b and c . If objects have type 1 and 4 and if t 1 ∈ T 1 = { a , b } and t 2 ∈ T 2 = { c , d } , attributes allow - ing object pair discrimination have type t 1 and t 2 and attributes allowing object pair similarity have diﬀerent types both in T 1 or both in T 2 . If objects have type 2 and 3 and if t 1 ∈ T 1 = { a , c } and t 2 ∈ T 2 = { b , d } , attributes allowing object pair discrimination have type t 1 and t 2 and attributes allowing object pair sim - ilarity have diﬀerent types both in T 1 or both in T 2 . ut In case of incomplete complexes , some of these properties are no more relevant and a degenerate behaviour may appear : some of the sets may be identical . This fact allows to establish a new proposition on complete complexes : Proposition 2 . In a complete analogical complex , side - by - side intersections of sets are empty . Proof . This property holds since when the intersection of two object ( resp . at - tribute ) sets in an analogical complex AC is not empty , then AC contains at least two empty attribute ( resp . object ) sets . This fact is a consequence of prop - erty 1 . Indeed , if an object belongs to two diﬀerent types , their proﬁles must be the From formal concepts to analogical complexes 165 same . The discrimination property ensures that the proﬁle of two diﬀerent ob - ject types diﬀer by at least two diﬀerent attribute with diﬀerent types ( e . g . if the object has type 1 and 3 , attributes of type b and c should have diﬀerent values ) . Thus it cannot exists attributes of the discriminant type ( e . g . attributes of type b and c in the previous case ) and the corresponding sets are empty . This completes the proof . The converse of the proposition is not true : if all side - by - side intersections of sets diﬀer , the complex is not necessary complete . For instance , consider the following context : a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 o 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 o 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 o 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 o 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 o 5 1 0 1 1 0 0 It contains the following not complete complex : (cid:0) ( { o 1 } , { o 2 } , { o 3 } , { o 4 } ) , ( { a 1 } , { a 2 , a 3 } , ∅ , { a 4 , a 5 } ) (cid:1) 4 The lattice of analogical complexes Deﬁnition 5 ( Partial Order on analogical complexes ) . Given two ana - logical complexes C 1 = ( O 11 , 4 , A 11 , 4 ) and C 2 = ( O 21 , 4 , A 21 , 4 ) , the partial order ≤ is deﬁned by C 1 ≤ C 2 iﬀ (cid:0) O 1 i ⊆ O 2 i for i = 1 , 4 and A 2 i ⊆ A 1 i for i = 1 , 4 (cid:1) . C 1 is called a sub - complex of C 2 and C 2 is called a super - complex of C 1 As for formal concepts , the set of all complexes has a lattice structure . Let us ﬁrst deﬁne a derivation operator on analogical quadruplets : Deﬁnition 6 ( Derivation on set quadruplets ) . Let O = O 1 ∪ O 2 ∪ O 3 ∪ O 4 be a set of objects partitioned in four subsets , and A be a set of attributes . For all i and j ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] , one deﬁnes O 0 ji = { a ∈ A | ∀ o ∈ O i I ( o , a ) ⇔ AS ( i , j ) } Let A = A 1 ∪ A 2 ∪ A 3 ∪ A 4 be a set of attributes partitioned in four subsets , and O be a set of objects . For all i and j ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] , one deﬁnes A 0 ji = { o ∈ O | ∀ a ∈ A i I ( o , a ) ⇔ AS ( i , j ) } Finally , we deﬁne the derivation on quadruplets as follows : O 0 1 , 4 = ( 4 \ j = 1 O 0 1 j , 4 \ j = 1 O 0 2 j , 4 \ j = 1 O 0 3 j , 4 \ j = 1 O 0 4 j ) A 0 1 , 4 = ( 4 \ j = 1 A 0 1 j , 4 \ j = 1 A 0 2 j , 4 \ j = 1 A 0 3 j , 4 \ j = 1 A 0 4 j ) 166 Laurent Miclet and Jacques Nicolas Example 3 . Consider O = ( { 12 } , { 28 } , { 59 } , { 49 } ) . One has : O 0 11 = { a ∈ A | ¬ I ( 12 , a ) } = { 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 } ; O 0 12 = { a ∈ A | ¬ I ( 28 , a ) } = { 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 } ; O 0 13 = { a ∈ A | I ( 59 , a ) } = { 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 } ; O 0 14 = { a ∈ A | I ( 49 , a ) } = { 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 } Then O 0 1 = T 4 j = 1 O 0 1 j = { 7 , 8 } Finally , O 0 = ( { 7 , 8 } , { 2 , 5 , 9 } , { 3 , 4 } , { 6 } ) . We exhibit a basic theorem for these complexes that naturally extends the basic theorem on concepts : Proposition 3 . Given two analogical complexes C 1 = ( O 11 , 4 , A 11 , 4 ) and C 2 = ( O 21 , 4 , A 21 , 4 ) , – The join of C 1 and C 2 is deﬁned by C 1 ∧ C 2 = ( O 1 , 4 , A 1 , 4 ) where ∀ i ∈ [ 1 , 4 ] O i = O i ( C 1 ) ∩ O i ( C 2 ) A 1 , 4 = (cid:0) A 1 ( C 1 ) ∪ A 1 ( C 2 ) , A 2 ( C 1 ) ∪ A 2 ( C 2 ) , A 3 ( C 1 ) ∪ A 3 ( C 2 ) , A 4 ( C 1 ) ∪ A 4 ( C 2 ) (cid:1) 00 – The meet of C 1 and C 2 is deﬁned by C 1 ∨ C 2 = ( O 1 , 4 , A 1 , 4 ) where O 1 , 4 = (cid:0) O 1 ( C 1 ) ∪ O 1 ( C 2 ) , O 2 ( C 1 ) ∪ O 2 ( C 2 ) , O 3 ( C 1 ) ∪ O 3 ( C 2 ) , O 4 ( C 1 ) ∪ O 4 ( C 2 ) (cid:1) 00 Proof . The meet and the join are dual and one only needs to prove the proposi - tion for the join . The ordering by set inclusion requires the set of objects O i of C 1 ∧ C 2 to be included in O i ( C 1 ) ∩ O i ( C 2 ) and its set of attributes A j to be in - cluded in A j ( C 1 ) ∪ A j C 2 ) . Taking exactly the intersection of objects thus ensures the set of objects to be maximal . The corresponding maximal sets of attributes may be inferred using the derivation operator ’ we have just deﬁned . Another way to generate these sets is to apply the derivation operator twice on the union of sets of attributes . Example 4 . The complex lattice of smallzoo has 24 elements , including 18 com - plete complexes . It is sketched in ﬁgure 3 . In this lattice , for example , the join of the analogical complex numbered 9 and 12 , which are as follows 9 = (cid:0) ( { 12 } , { 28 } , { 59 , 64 } , { 20 , 49 } ) , ( { 7 } , { 9 } , { 4 } , { 6 } ) (cid:1) 12 = (cid:0) ( { 12 , 17 } , { 28 } , { 59 } , { 49 , 64 } ) , ( { 7 } , { 2 , 5 } , { 3 } , { 6 } ) (cid:1) is number 15 , namely : 15 = (cid:0) ( { 12 } , { 28 } , { 59 } , { 49 } ) , ( { 7 , 8 } , { 2 , 5 , 9 } , { 3 , 4 } , { 6 } ) (cid:1) The resulting object sets are for each type the intersection of the two joined object sets . The resulting attribute sets contain for each type the union of the two joined attribute sets and may contain other elements with a correct proﬁle on all objects . For instance , A 1 ( 9 ∧ 12 ) = { 7 , 8 } is made of the union of A 1 ( 9 ) From formal concepts to analogical complexes 167 and A 1 ( 12 ) ( { 7 } ) plus attribute 8 since 8 has the right proﬁle ( 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 ) on O 1 , 4 ( that is , ¬ I ( 12 , 8 ) , ¬ I ( 28 , 8 ) , I ( 59 , 8 ) and I ( 49 , 8 ) ) . The meet of the analogical complexes numbered 9 and 12 is number 19 , namely 19 = (cid:0) ( { 12 , 17 , 28 } , { 12 , 17 , 28 } , { 20 , 49 , 59 , 64 } , { 20 , 49 , 59 , 64 } ) , ( { 7 } , ∅ , ∅ , { 6 } ) (cid:1) 5 Conclusion We have introduced a new conceptual object called analogical complex that uses a complex relation , analogical proportion , to compare objects with respect to their attribute values . Although this relation works on set quadruplets instead of simple sets like in formal concepts , we have shown that it is possible to keep the main properties of concepts , that is , maximality and comparison at the level of object or attribute pairs . The set of all complexes are structured within a lattice that contains two types of elements . The most meaningful ones only contain non empty sets and are a strong support for doing analogical inference . An interesting extension of this work would be to develop this inference process for analogical data mining in a way close to rule generation in FCA . The degenerate case where some of the sets are empty is more frequent than in FCA where their presence is limited to the top or bottom of the lattice . The presence of a single empty set may reﬂect the lack of some object or attribute and is thus a possible new research direction for completing a knowledge base or an ontology . Particularly , analogy in a Boolean framework introduces a form of negation through the search of dissimilarities ( discrimination ) between objects . We have written an implementation the search for complete analogical com - plexes , using the Answer Set Programming framework [ 1 ] . The properties of deﬁnition 3 are translated straightforwardly in logical constraints and the search of all complexes is achieved by an ASP solver looking for all solutions . The de - scription of the ASP program would be beyond the scope of this paper but it can be seen as a relatively simple exercise of extension of the search for formal concepts by adding a few logical constraints . It is likely that most of the existing tools of FCA could be adapted the same way for analogical complex analysis . This would allow to include both categorization and analogy within common data mining environments . References 1 .
