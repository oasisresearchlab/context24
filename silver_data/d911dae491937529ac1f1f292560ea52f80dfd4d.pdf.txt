The myosin motor domain hydrolyses ATP , resulting in conformational changes that are ampliﬁed by the myosin lever arm that links the motor domain to the rod domain . Recent cryo - electron micro - scopic data have provided a clear picture of the myosin - ATP – F - actin com - plex , but structural insights into other stages of the myosin - actin interaction have been less forthcoming . To address this issue , we cross - linked F - actin subunits between Cys374 and Lys191 , and separated them by gel ﬁltration . Puriﬁed actin - dimers , - trimers and - tetramers retained the ability to polymerize and to stimulate myosin - subfragment 1 ( myosin - S1 ) ATPase activity . To generate stable actin oligomer : myosin - S1 complexes , we blocked actin polymerization with gelsolin and Clostridium botulinum iota toxin - mediated ADP - ribosylation . After polymerization inhibition , actin - trimers and - tetramers retained the ability to stimulate the myosin - S1 - ATPase , whereas the actin - dimer showed very little ATPase stimulation . We then analysed the stoichiometry and binding afﬁnity of myosin - S1 to actin oligomers . Actin - trimers and - tetramers bound myosin - S1 in the absence of nucleotide ; the trimer contains one myosin - S1 binding site . We calculated a dissociation constant ( K d ) of 1 . 1 9 10 (cid:1) 10 M and 1 . 9 9 10 (cid:1) 10 M for binding of native F - actin and the actin - trimer to myo - sin - S1 , respectively . EM of the actin - trimer : myosin - S1 complex demon - strated the presence of single particles of uniform size . Image reconstruction allowed a reasonable ﬁt of the actin - trimer and myosin - S1 into the obtained density clearly showing binding of one myosin - S1 mole - cule to the two long - pitch actins of the trimer , supporting the kinetic data . Introduction The cyclic interaction of myosin molecules with F - actin generates contractile force in muscle cells and powers a large variety of motility processes in non - muscle cells . During this interaction ATP is hydrolysed into ADP and inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) by the myosin motor domain , which provides the energy for the production of mechanical force . Contractile force is generated by cyclic conformational changes of Abbreviations HEPES4 , 4 - ( hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ; IAF , iodoacetamide ﬂuoresceine ; mantADP , 3 0 - O - ( N - methylandranidoyl ) adenosine - diphosphate ; MES , 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ; PBM , 1 , 4 - para - phenylene - bismaleimide . 1715 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 1715 – 1729 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies the motor domain and ampliﬁed by the swinging motion of the so - called lever - arm linking the myosin motor domain to its rod domain [ 1 – 3 ] . In the absence of ATP the myosin motor domain ﬁrmly attaches to F - actin with high afﬁnity forming the so - called rigor complex . Recent cryo - electron microscopical analyses of myosin motor domain decorated F - actin have yielded a model of the rigor - state at almost atomic resolution [ 4 – 6 ] . These data have also convincingly demonstrated that the myosin motor domain interacts with two adjacent actin subunits along the long - pitch F - actin helix though the interaction with the upper subunit appears stronger [ 5 – 7 ] . In contrast , structural details of the steps during ATP - hydrolysis and the force generating process of acto - myosin are not yet available at the molecular level [ 1 – 5 ] . Optimal for this goal would be high - resolution structural studies of the acto - myosin cycle halted at certain steps of the ATPase cycle . A possible procedure to achieve this aim could be the structural analysis of stable small functional actin - myosin complexes . Therefore , it appears essential to purify small actin oligomers possessing the ability to functionally interact with myosin motor domains . To this end , we isolated by gel ﬁltration actin - dimer , - trimer and - tetramer cross - linked by 1 , 4 - para - pheny - lene - bismaleimide ( PBM ) between Cys374 and Lys191 along the genetic helix [ 8 , 9 ] . Optimization of the gel ﬁl - tration procedure allowed the isolation of pure cross - linked actin - dimer , - trimer and - tetramer , which still retain the ability to polymerize on their own to func - tional actin ﬁlaments and to nucleate actin polymeriza - tion as also reported previously [ 10 – 12 ] . Therefore , it was necessary to block their ability to polymerize in order to maintain their oligomeric state after addition of myosin motor domains . This was achieved by ADP - ribosylation or / and complexation with gelsolin seg - ments in particular the N - terminal segment G1 or its N - terminal half comprising segments 1 – 3 ( G1 – 3 ) [ 13 – 15 ] . Here , we ﬁrst describe the general properties of puriﬁed actin - dimer , - trimer and – tetramer . Subse - quently , we test ADP - ribosylation at Arg177 by iota toxin of Clostridium botulinum or / and complexation to gelsolin segments G1 or G1 – 3 to achieve inhibition of their ability to polymerize . After polymerization inhibition their ability to interact with the motor domain from rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II ( myo - sin - subfragment 1 ) was analysed for the actin - dimer , - trimer and - tetramer . Only the trimer and tetramer were able to appreciably stimulate the myosin - subfrag - ment 1 - ATPase activity . Binding data indicated that the trimer interacted with one and the tetramer with two myosin - S1 molecules . Because we wanted to anal - yse the smallest possible acto - myosin complex , we concentrated subsequently on the trimer complex hop - ing that it might be amenable for high - resolution X - ray or electron microscopical analysis . Indeed , prelimi - nary EM data indicate that a stable 1 : 1 : 1 complex of trimer with the gelsolin segment G1 and rabbit skeletal muscle myosin - subfragment 1 ( myosin - S1 ) can be formed , which appears to be amenable to EM structure analysis . Results Isolation of cross - linked oligomers by gel ﬁltration Polymerized rabbit skeletal muscle actin was cross - linked by 1 , 4 - PBM ( 1 , 4 - para - phenylene - bismaleimide ) . SDS / PAGE indicated the generation of actin - dimer , - trimer , - tetramer and higher mass oligomers with decreasing concentrations ( Fig . 1A ) . After dialysis against HEPES - buffer ( 5 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 m M NaN 3 , and 0 . 2 m M ATP ) with three changes of the dialysis solution , the cross - linked material was applied to either a conventional Sepha - cryl S300 gel ﬁltration column or a Superdex TM 200 FPLC ( fast protein liquid chromatography ) column and eluted with HEPES - buffer supplemented with 0 . 2 m M ATP . The fractions collected were analysed by SDS / PAGE ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Elution by the conven - tional gel ﬁltration Sephacryl S300 column ( size : diameter 45 mm , height 800 mm ; fraction size 2 mL ) resulted in clear separation of the oligomers ( Fig . 1B ) but lasted two days . When using a Superdex TM 200 FPLC - column ( size : diameter 26 mm , height 600 mm ; fraction size 1 mL ) the separation of trimer and tetra - mer was less effective ( Fig . 1C ) but lasted only 4 h . In order to obtain pure trimer or tetramer prepara - tions , it was necessary to rechromatograph the pooled oligomer fractions after their concentration with Mil - lipore concentrators using a Sephacryl 300 FPLC - col - umn ( size : diameter 16 mm , height 600 mm ) . Pure tetramer was only obtained after rechromatography for three times over the Superdex 300 FPLC - column . Individual actin - oligomers ( upper actin - dimer ( UD ) , - trimer or - tetramer ) were obtained by pooling the fractions identiﬁed by SDS / PAGE and subsequent concentration by Millipore concentrators . The obtained oligomers were at least 80 % pure ( Fig . 1D ) . Typically , when 10 mg cross - linked actin was sepa - rated by FPLC chromatography the yield for dimer , trimer and tetramer was about 0 . 9 mg , 0 . 7 mg and 0 . 6 mg , respectively . 1716 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 1715 – 1729 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction Z . Qu et al . The isolated oligomers polymerize and stimulate the myosin - S1 - ATPase In a previous report we demonstrated the functionality of the isolated oligomers by measuring their ability to nucleate actin polymerization [ 16 ] . Here , we show that the isolated oligomers inhibited the DNA - degrading activity of DNase I albeit to different extents ( Fig . 2A ) indicating the preservation of their native state . The dimer inhibited DNase I like G - actin [ 17 ] , whereas the inhibition decreased with increasing oligomer size ( Fig . 2A ) suggesting that some actin subunits were blocked for DNase I binding by actin - actin contacts . Fur - thermore , it has been shown that DNase I binds also to the minus end of F - actin but binding to the actins of both strands appears be excluded by steric hindrance [ 18 ] . This may explain the lower inhibitory capacity of the tetramer . Their ability to directly polymerize was veriﬁed by using pyrene - labelled monomeric actin at a 10fold lower molar ratio to oligomer ( for details see Materials and methods ) and demonstrated rates of polymerization identical to native actin ( Fig . 2B ) . In addition , electron microscopy after negative staining ( EM ) showed that actin - dimer , - trimer and - tetramer formed normal appearing ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2D – F ) . When polymerized by addition of 2 m M MgCl 2 the cross - linked actin - oligomers ( F - dimer , F - trimer and F - tetramer ) stimulated the Mg 2 + - dependent myosin - S1 - ATPase to the same extent as native F - actin demonstrating that the cross - linking reaction had not impaired their functional interaction with myosin heads ( Fig . 2C ) as also supported by suc - cessful decoration of these oligomer ﬁlaments with myo - sin - S1 ( shown for the F - trimer in Fig . 2G ) . Inhibition of actin - oligomer polymerization Myosin motor domains are able to induce actin polymerization [ 19 ] . In order to generate stable oligomer : myosin - S1 complexes it was necessary to inhibit the polymerizability of the puriﬁed oligomers . Therefore , we searched for methods to inhibit their ability to polymerize . Complexation of oligomers with gelsolin or gelsolin fragments Initially we tested the effect of complexation of isolated and native trimer and tetramer with intact gelsolin , its N - terminal half comprising the segments G1 – 3 or its N - terminal segment G1 to inhibit oligomer polymerization . Gelsolin exhibits F - actin capping and severing activities in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner [ 20 , 21 ] . The N - terminal half of gelsolin G1 – 3 exhibits these activities in a Ca 2 + - independent manner . Both intact gelsolin and G1 – 3 form stable complexes with two actin molecules , which are able to nucleate actin polymerization [ 20 , 21 ] . In contrast , G1 binds to mono - meric actin with high afﬁnity in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and inhibits its ability to polymerize [ 22 ] . 1 2 3 M 95 96 98 100 102 104 106 108 110 112 104 Monomer Dimer ( UD ) Trimer Tetramer A B M 95 96 98 100 102 104 106 108 110 - - UD - - C M xA D - - Tetramer - - - - Trimer - - Fig . 1 .

Qu et al . Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction When tested by the pyrene - assay ( as described above ) in the presence of 2 m M MgCl 2 , addition of intact gelsolin or G1 – 3 to isolated trimer or tetramer at equal to oligomer concentration induced a higher rate of increase in pyrene - ﬂuorescence than the oligo - mer on its own possibly due to their nucleating effects ( shown for the trimer and G1 – 3 in Fig . 3A ) . However , when added equimolar to the oligomer subunit con - centration G1 – 3 inhibited oligomer polymerization ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast , addition of G1 did not show this stimulatory effect , instead it gradually inhibited the polymerization of native trimer or tetramer reach - ing complete inhibition only when added equimolar to the subunit concentration of the oligomer ( shown for the trimer in Fig . 3C ) . ADP - ribosylation of the actin - oligomers As a further procedure to inhibit actin polymerization we tested the effect of ADP - ribosylation on oligomer polymerization . Clostridium botulinum iota toxin ADP - ribosylates G - actin at Arg177 and inhibits its polymer - ization [ 13 , 14 ] . We treated the actin - oligomers like G - actin with C . botulinum iota toxin in order to achieve their ADP - ribosylation . Previously , native gel electrophoresis ( NGE ) has been performed to demon - strate successful oligomer ADP - ribosylation [ 23 ] . Like ADP - ribosylated monomeric actin previous data showed that the actin - dimer migrates faster after ADP - ribosylation [ 23 ] . A slight shift in the migration rate had been detected also for the trimer , but not clearly for the tetramer most probably due to its con - siderably reduced migration into the native gel [ 16 , 23 ] . Therefore , successful ADP - ribosylation of isolated dimer , trimer and tetramer was investigated by using etheno - NAD as substrate for iota - toxin . Placing the SDS / PAGE gel on a ﬂuorescent screen demonstrated ﬂuorescent labelling of the dimer , trimer and tetramer ( albeit with deceasing intensity ) indicating incorpora - tion of etheno - ADP ( Fig 3B ) , although the number of Inhibition of DNaseI by actino ligomers 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 1 2 3 4 % I nh i b i t i on Dimer Trimer Tetramer Polymerization of actin oligomers 0 . 01 0 . 012 0 . 014 0 . 016 0 . 018 0 5 10 15 20 25 Time ( min ) AU 2 . 5 µ M UD 2 . 5 µ M trimer 2 . 5 µ M tetramer 2 . 5 µ M G - actin G F E D Myosin - S1 - ATPase stimulation by F - oligomers 0 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 0 . 2 0 . 24 0 2 4 6 8 10 µ M A T P h y d r o l yse d / µ M S 1 / sec F - dimer F - trimer F - tetramer NativeF - actin A B C Actin subunit ( µ M ) Actin subunit ( µ M ) Fig . 2 .

Qu et al . subunits modiﬁed was not determined . After ADP - ribosylation the pyrene - assay ( as described above ) indi - cated almost complete inhibition of polymerization of thus treated oligomers after addition of 2 m M MgCl 2 ( shown for the trimer in Fig . 3C ) . Furthermore , the ADP - ribosylated trimer and tetramer had lost their ability to nucleate actin polymerization as shown pre - viously [ 16 ] . Complexation of ADP - ribosylated oligo - mers with G1 – 3 or G1 at 1 : 1 molar ratio to oligomer completely inhibited polymerization ( shown for the tri - mer and G1 also in Fig . 3C ) even after addition of myosin - S1 equimolar to the oligomer ( shown for the trimer in Fig . 3D ) . Stimulation of the myosin - S1 - ATPase by polymerization - inhibited oligomers Next we measured the stimulation of the Mg 2 + - dependent myosin - S1 - ATPase activity by the ADP - ribosylated oligomers . It was found that the ADP - ribosylated tetramer and trimer possessed stimulating activity almost like native F - actin when added in molar excess to myosin - S1 ( not shown ) . In contrast , ADP - ribosylated actin - dimer hardly stimu - lated the myosin - S1 - ATPase ( not shown ) , in fact it behaved like monomeric actin or the previously iso - lated cross - linked long - pitch dimer [ 19 , 24 , 25 ] . How - ever , it cannot be completely excluded that under these conditions the ADP - ribosylated tetramer and - trimer partially polymerized due to incomplete ADP - ribosyla - tion or induced by binding of myosin - S1 . In order to exclude this possibility the stimulation of the myosin - S1 - ATPase was analysed for the ADP - ribosylated oligomers complexed additionally to G1 or G1 – 3 ( at 1 : 1 molar ratio ) in order to secure inhibi - tion of their polymerizability ( shown for ADPrib - oligomer : G1 – 3 complex in Fig . 4A ) . When under these conditions the concentrations of the oligomers were calculated as actin subunits , clear differences in their stimulatory capacity became obvious and indicated a considerably higher stimulating activity of native F - actin than by the tetramer and trimer ( Fig . 4A ) .

Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction These differences in the myosin - S1 - ATPase stimulation indicate also that oligomer polymerization did not occur during the ATPase measurement , which might have occurred in the absence of G1 – 3 . Furthermore , the rates of decrease in NADH absorbance did not accelerate with time . In addition , it was noted that the myosin - S1 - ATPase stimulation was slightly lower for ADP - ribosylated oligomers in complex with G1 – 3 than with G1 probably due to competition of the G2 moi - ety with S1 - binding ( Fig . 4B ) [ 21 ] . These data sug - gested that not every subunit of the oligomers was able to functionally interact with myosin - S1 . There is general agreement that each myosin head binds to two adjacent long - pitch subunits [ 4 – 7 , 26 ] allowing almost every subunit of a long native actin - ﬁlament to partici - pate in a functional interaction with a myosin head . In contrast , the tetramer contains twice two actins in long pitch orientation forming two binding sites for myo - sin - S1 , whereas the trimer will possess only one such binding site ( only two actins in long - pitch orientation ) . Therefore , it is not surprising that the myosin - S1 - ATPase stimulation by these oligomers is lower than by native F - actin when calculated as subunit concen - tration . Determination of the number of myosin - S1 binding sites on trimer During the force producing acto - myosin ATPase cycle F - actin accelerates the rate of ADP - dissociation from myosin [ 4 – 6 ] . Therefore , a further functional test of F - actin is its ability to induce the dissociation of myo - sin motor head bound nucleotide . This ability was probed by measuring the rate of release of ﬂuorescent mantADP from myosin - S1 [ 25 ] . The rates of man - tADP release bound to myosin - S1 were determined for increasing concentrations of phalloidin - stabilized native F - actin and ADP - ribosylated trimer in complex with G1 ( 1 : 1 ) by stopped - ﬂow techniques ( see Mate - rials and methods ) .

Qu et al . trimer , because it was possible to obtain it in higher amounts and furthermore since it appeared to form the smallest functional acto - myosin head complex . The concentration of myosin - S1 containing equimo - lar mantADP was set at 0 . 25 l M ﬁnal concentration in the observation chamber . The rates of mantADP release from myosin - S1 were determined for three con - centrations of native F - actin and G1 : ADP - ribosylated - trimer complex always supplemented with ATP ( 25 l M ﬁnal concentration in observation chamber ) to prevent rebinding of mantADP ( Fig . 4C , D ) . Both native F - actin ( Fig . 4C ) and G1 : ADP - ribosylated - trimer com - plex ( Fig . 4D ) considerably increased this rate when compared to ATP alone ( 25 l M ﬁnal concentration ) . As further control ADP - ribosylated - dimer as used , which was found not to further increase the rate of mantADP release ( not shown ) . The rates could be ﬁt - ted by two exponential reactions : a slow phase pre - sumably representing the nonstimulated release rates of mantADP from myosin - S1 ( also given by the intercept of the regression line with the abscissa in Fig . 4E ) and a fast reaction representing the actin - stimulated mantADP release . When the fast rates were plotted against actin subunit ( for F - actin ) or trimer oligomer concentrations almost identical dependencies of the release rates on their concentra - tions were observed ( not shown ) . When , however , the trimer concentrations were calculated also as actin subunit concentrations then the regression line was about threefold shallower indicating that the trimer behaves like a single myosin - S1 binding unit ( Fig . 4E ) . Determination of the binding afﬁnity of myosin - S1 to actin - oligomers Next we attempted to determine the afﬁnity of myo - sin - S1 binding to the cross - linked actin - trimer . A num - ber of different ﬂuorescent assays were tested like competition of oligomeric actin with pyrene - labelled F - actin for binding to myosin - S1 [ 27 , 28 ] , which , how - ever , necessitated large amounts of the puriﬁed oligo - mers . The assay , which turned out to best suited was an assay based on the ﬂuorescence increase in IAF - labelled myosin - S1 upon binding to F - actin [ 29 ] . Initial experiments veriﬁed that the ﬂuorescence of IAF - myosin - S1 increases on binding to native F - actin or to isolated ADP - ribosylated trimer ( Fig . 5A ) or tet - ramer ( not shown ) in complex with G1 . For these experiments the actin samples were gelﬁltrated over a Sephacryl S300 FPLC ( 16 / 60 ) column ( see Materials and methods ) and furthermore treated with 0 . 2 l L apyrase ( 2 mg (cid:3) mL (cid:1) 1 ) per 100 l L oligomer sample ( see Materials and methods ) to degrade any residual ATP . Then binding of F - actin or the oligomers induced an increase in the ﬂuorescence of IAF - labelled myosin - S1 as reported before ( Fig . 5A ) [ 29 ] . In these experiments the native F - actin was stabilized by phalloidin ( at a ratio of 3 : 1 ) to prevent depolymerization when employed close to the critical concentration of poly - merization , and the oligomers were additionally com - plexed to G1 , which in contrast with G1 – 3 was found not to reduce the ﬂuorescence change on binding to IAF - S1 when comparing trimer and F - actin ( Fig . 5A ) . From the binding curves it became evident that not every actin subunit of the trimer was able to interact with myosin - S1 , since similar ﬂuorescence increases were only obtained when comparing the actin subunit concentration of F - actin with the oligomer concentra - tion ( Fig . 5A ) . Furthermore , addition of 0 . 05 m M ATP to preformed F - actin : IAF - S1 or G1 : oligomer : IAF - S1 complexes resulted in all cases in a rapid drop of the IAF - ﬂuorescence demonstrating rapid dissocia - tion of the complexes , i . e . full nucleotide dependence of also the oligomer - myosin - S1 interaction ( not shown ) . Next , we used the stopped ﬂow set - up to determine the rates of association of F - actin and ADP - ribosylated trimer : G1 to IAF - myosin - S1 at a high molar excess of the actins to obtain pseudo - ﬁrst order conditions . Due to the larger amounts of actin oligomer needed for these experiments we concentrated on the trimer : G1 complex and native F - actin . The data obtained indi - cated very similar observed rates of association for native F - actin and trimer : G1 complex when calculated as subunit or oligomer concentrations , respectively ( Fig . 5C , D ) . The rate constants of association were calculated to 13 9 10 6 M (cid:1) 1 (cid:3) s (cid:1) 1 and 16 9 10 6 M (cid:1) 1 (cid:3) s (cid:1) 1 for native F - actin and ADP - ribosylated trimer : G1 complex , respectively . Again when plotting the rates obtained for the trimer as subunit concentration an about threefold difference was observed conﬁrming the notion that the trimer interacts with only one myosin - S1 molecule ( Fig . 5E ) . When ﬁtting the ﬂuorescence traces it was , however , observed that they contained two exponentials : a fast initial rate , which was used to calculate the rates of association and a considerably slower rate , which might due to an isomerisation step of myosin - S1 following nucleotide binding [ 30 ] . The amplitudes of the two phases were almost identical for the employed trimer concentrations ( about 50 % each ) , but for native F - actin the percental amplitudes of the fast phase were 30 % , 60 % and 72 % at 0 . 46 l M , 0 . 93 l M and 1 . 85 l M ﬁnal concentrations , respectively , possibly indicating slight differences in their binding mode or target area . 1721 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 1715 – 1729 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Z . Qu et al . Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction The rates of dissociation of IAF - S1 from native F - actin and the G1 : trimer complex were determined by using a conventional spectroﬂuorometer ( Fig . 5B ) . After addition of a 20 - fold molar excess of unlabelled myosin - S1 to preformed F - actin : IAF - S1 and G1 : ADP - ribosylated oligomer : IAF - S1 complexes the dissocia - tion rate constants were determined to be 1 . 43 (cid:4) 1 . 0 9 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 for native F - actin and 3 . 04 (cid:4) 1 . 0 9 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 for G1 : ADP - ribosylated trimer ( Fig . 5B ) . Using these numbers the dissociation constants ( K d values ) were calculated to be 1 . 1 9 10 (cid:1) 10 M and 1 . 9 9 10 (cid:1) 10 M for native F - actin and the ADP - ribosy - lated trimer : G1 complex , respectively . EM of actin - trimer myosin - subfragment 1 complexes Finally , we analysed by EM after negative staining iso - lated complexes of G1 : ADP - ribosylated - trimer in com - plex with ( unlabelled ) skeletal muscle myosin - S1 . Gel ﬁltration data had indicated that the G1 : oligomer : myosin - S1 complex eluted at positions corresponding to the molecular masses of the ternary complex [ 27 ] .

Qu et al . light chains A1 or A2 was added ( 1 : 1 molar ratio ) and after a further incubation period of 1 h negatively stained EM grids were prepared at protein concentra - tions of 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 mg (cid:3) mL (cid:1) 1 . Under optimal conditions single particles of uniform size were detected ( Fig . 6A ) . From these EM images 2500 single 2D - particles were manually picked from 106 micrographs , of which 1924 were sorted into eight classes using EMAN2 . 1beta ( National Center for Macromolecular Imaging , Hous - ton , USA ) [ 32 ] ( Fig . 6B ) . The percental distribution of the picked particles into each class is given in the legend of Fig . 6 . The eight classes were used to calcu - late a tentative 3D contour map ( using EMAN 2 . 1 beta - 4 [ 32 ] ) . We performed a tentative ﬁt of reference models of the actin : trimer [ 5 – 7 ] and of myosin - S1 in rigor conformation into this initial and approximate contour map using the programmes SITUS , SCULPTOR , and CHIMERA [ 33 , 34 ] .

( C ) Plausibility ﬁtting of the molecular models of a trimeric actin and actin - bound myosin - S1 into a 3D - density reconstructed from the negative stain data using the software package CHIMERA [ 29 ] . Here , three actin monomers in their genetic F - actin helical arrangement ( dark blue : long - pitch actins ; and light blue for the actin of the opposing strand ) with one myosin - S1 bound to the two long - pitch actins in rigor conformation ( green ) [ 4 , 7 ] was used for the ﬁt ( for details see text ) . The PDB - model without density ( right panel ) illustrates the orientation of the actin - trimer in canonical , upright position ( pointed end at its top ) . Note the missing density for the myosin light chain ( shown in grey [ 31 ] , albeit outside the calculated density map ) , possibly due to lever arm ﬂexibility . Figure 6C was prepared using the software package CHIMERA [ 29 ] . 1723 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 1715 – 1729 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Z . Qu et al . Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction well into the density of the approximate model gener - ated by Chimera [ 35 ] as shown at a resolution of about 2 nm in Fig . 6C . The three actin subunits can be located in the proper F - actin helical orientation [ 4 , 36 ] stained dark and light blue ( Fig . 6C ) . It was possible to ﬁt myosin - S1 into the contour ( stained green ) in an orientation contacting both long - pitch actin subunits ( dark blue ) of the trimer . In spite of the preliminary nature of the molecular ﬁt shown in Fig . 6C the EM - data appear to also support the bio - chemical data suggesting that only one myosin - S1 molecule attaches to the trimer : G1 complex . Discussion Treatment of F - actin with the reagent 1 , 4 - PBM gener - ates actin - dimers , - trimers , - tetramers , and higher mass oligomers cross - linked along the genetic helix [ 8 , 9 ] . As reported previously conventional gel ﬁltration had allowed the isolation of actin - dimer , - trimer and - tetra - mer [ 10 ] , which were used to study their ability to nucleate actin polymerization [ 10 – 12 ] . Here , we used FPLC - procedures to rapidly separate the cross - linked actin - oligomers . The thus isolated actin - dimer , - trimer and - tetramer showed normal functionality in that they were able to nucleate actin polymerization [ 16 ] and to polymerize after increasing the ionic strength to nor - mally appearing F - actin ﬁlaments . In addition , the polymerized oligomers were able to stimulate the Mg 2 + - dependent myosin - S1 - ATPase like native F - actin . Since we aimed to obtain stable actin - oligomers of deﬁned length we searched for procedures to inhibit their polymerization while maintaining their ability to functionally interact with myosin head domains . Two different approaches were tested to block their poly - merizability . First we tested whether ADP - ribosylation by C . botulinum iota - toxin inhibited oligomer polymer - ization . The ADP - ribose moiety attached to Arg177 of actin is orientated towards the interstrand face of F - actin leading to an inhibition of polymerization of thus treated G - actin [ 13 , 14 ] . We observed a clearly reduced polymerizability of ADP - ribosylated trimer and tetramer , though EM showed the presence of short ﬁlaments and / or aggregates ( as also indicated by previous reports ) . Using etheno - NAD as substrate for iota - toxin indicated etheno - ADP incorporation and native gel electrophoresis had previously shown an increased migration of the treated trimer suggesting ADP - ribosylation [ 23 ] , though this does not give deﬁnitive information how many actin subunits of the trimer or tetramer were ADP - ribosylated . Since it has been shown that native F - actin is not a substrate for C . botulinum iota - toxin , it appears possible that only the terminally located actin subunits were ADP - ribosylated and probably not those having normal interstrand con - tacts [ 13 , 14 ] . Secondly , we tested the effect of binding of gelsolin and gelsolin fragments on their polymerization capac - ity . Kinetic experiments using pyrene - labelled actin indicated that intact gelsolin or G1 – 3 at equimolar concentration to not - ADP - ribosylated oligomers did not inhibit their polymerization possibly due to their nucleating activity . Addition of the N - terminal seg - ment G1 to trimer or tetramer stepwise reduced their polymerizability till at equimolar ratio to subunit con - centration complete inhibition of polymerization was attained . Though each procedure reduced oligomer polymeriz - ability , complete and reliable inhibition of polymeriza - tion was secured only by combining both procedures . When using ADP - ribosylated oligomers complete inhi - bition of polymerization was already obtained at G1 or G1 – 3 concentrations equimolar to the oligomer . Therefore , in subsequent experiments the oligomers were both ADP - ribosylated and complexed to prefer - ably G1 to obtain efﬁcient inhibition of their polymer - ization also in the presence of myosin - S1 . These complexes were tested for their ability to acti - vate the myosin - S1 - ATPase . The smallest actin - oligo - mer able to activate the myosin - S1 - ATPase was found to be the ADP - ribosylated trimer . The extent of the stimulation of the myosin - S1 - ATPase by the oligomers was considerably lower than by native F - actin when related to their subunit concentrations . These and the kinetic data ( see below ) indicated that the trimer pos - sesses only one and the tetramer two binding sites for myosin - S1 , because two adjacent actin subunits along the long - pitch helix are necessary to form the fully functional myosin - S1 binding area [ 4 – 7 , 26 ] . Since 1 , 4 - PBM is known to cross - link along the genetic helix of F - actin , it follows that the trimer will possess only one and the tetramer two such interaction sides , i . e . two adjacent actin subunits in long - pitch helix orientation . This fact may also explain why the isolated actin - dimer did not stimulate the myosin - S1 - ATPase above the level of native G - actin , because within the dimer the two actins are not in long - pitch orientation neces - sary for full functional interaction with myosin - S1 . The functionality of the isolated and polymerization inhibited trimer was further tested for its ability to stimulate nucleotide release from myosin - S1 and the determination of its binding afﬁnity to IAF - labelled myosin - S1 . Both tests demonstrated almost identical behaviour of the trimer with native F - actin when the trimer concentrations were calculated as oligomer . 1724 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 1715 – 1729 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction Z . Qu et al . When , however , these data were related to actin sub - unit concentrations , it became obvious that the trimer possessed an about threefold lower number of myosin binding sites in full agreement with the fact that the myosin - S1 binding site on F - actin is formed by two adjacent long - pitch actin subunits . Of note , the K d of IAF - myosin - S1 to native F - actin and ADP - ribosylated trimer : G1 complex differed not signiﬁcantly and were determined to be 1 . 1 9 10 (cid:1) 10 M and 1 . 9 9 10 (cid:1) 10 M , respectively . A previous report described the use 1 , 4 - PDM to gener - ate long - pitch dimers including polymerization - deﬁcient actin mutants [ 37 ] . These authors observed also that ADP - ribosylation was an efﬁcient procedure to inhibit polymerization of the long - pitch dimer , which was shown to functionally interact with myosin - S1 molecules [ 37 ] . In contrast with our kinetic and structural data , their results suggested binding of two myosin - S1 molecules to this dimer albeit with different afﬁnities [ 37 ] . We assume that complexation of one gelsolin - G1 molecule to the plus end of the trimer prevented binding of a second myosin - S1 to the ‘lower’ actin of the trimer by steric hindrance ( [ 22 ] , see Fig . 6C ) . EM of the G1 – 3 or G1 : oligomer : S1 ternary com - plexes demonstrated the presence of particles of uni - form size . Single particle analysis using EM images from negative stained G1 : trimer : myosin - S1 complex was performed for further characterization . It was pos - sible to group 1924 picked particles into eight classes , which were fused into a single density model . Subse - quently , it was possible to ﬁt 3D - reference structures of the actin : trimer in F - conﬁguration and subfragment 1 of myosin V in rigor conformation [ 7 ] into the con - tour map of the G1 : trimer : myosin - S1 complex obtained by the particle analysis . Fitting of these refer - ence 3D - structures resulted in a preliminary model that suggested that the trimer : G1 complex bound only one myosin - S1 molecule . The proposed model agreed well with a number of known features of the rigor acto - myosin complex as recently determined by cryo - EM of myosin - S1 decorated F - actin [ 5 – 7 ] . In addition , attempts were made to calculate the volume of the contour map . It was , however , noted that small changes in density model resulted in large changes of its volume ; therefore it did not appear useful to deduce the molecular mass of the trimer . G1 : myosin - S1 com - plex and the number myosin - S1 molecules bound . Further high resolution EM studies will be necessary to more exactly identify the parameters of the helical orientation of the actin subunits of the trimer complex , since it could be distorted by the ADP - ribosylation and / or G1 binding . Previous X - ray crystallography of the PBM - cross - linked trimer complexed to three G1 molecules had shown that due to the intercalation of G1 the actin subunits adopted a larger subunit distance ( 7 . 5 instead of 5 . 5 nm ) and underwent a helical distortion [ 38 ] . We assume that binding of only one G1 molecule to isolated trimer did not distort its normal F - actin heli - cal symmetry , because it will preferentially bind to an actin exposing a free plus end [ 22 ] . Indeed , our contour map would not be compatible with an actin subunit dis - tance of 7 . 5 nm . In addition , myosin - S1 binding might have stabilized the helical symmetry . Our model sug - gests that the myosin - S1 was attached to the side of the two long - pitch actin subunits of the trimer in a manner similar to previously described cryo - EM data of myo - sin - S1 decorated F - actin [ 5 – 7 ] . The kinetic together with the structural albeit prelimi - nary data demonstrating for the polymerization inhib - ited trimer functional myosin head interactions make us conﬁdent that the actin subunits of isolated trimer main - tained the normal F - actin orientation . Of note , varia - tions in the helical parameters of native F - actin have been frequently described and regarded as a functional adaptation [ 39 ] . Future structural experiments using cryo - EM or crystallographic techniques will be aimed to further prove this assumption by obtaining higher reso - lution of the trimer : myosin - S1 complex .

Qu et al . Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction ratio to F - actin subunits of 4 : 1 . After 30 min the cross - linking reaction was blocked by addition of 20 m M DTT . The F - actin was diluted to 1 mg (cid:3) mL (cid:1) 1 with HEPES - buffer ( 5 m M HEPES - OH , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 m M ATP , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 and 0 . 5 m M NaN 3 ) and dialysed for 7 days with three changes of the HEPES - buffer dialysis solution [ 16 ] . The oli - gomers were separated either by conventional gel ﬁltration using a Sephacryl S300 column ( 4 . 5 9 90 cm ) or by FPLC ( fast protein liquid chromatography ) using a HighLoad Superdex TM 200 ( 26 / 60 ) column ( Pharmacia ; GE Health Care , Freiburg , Germany ) . Typically , 2 mL of cross - linked actin oligomers ( at 1 . 5 mg (cid:3) mL (cid:1) 1 ) was applied to either col - umn and eluted with HEPES - buffer . The FPLC - column was eluted at a ﬂow rate of 2 mL (cid:3) min (cid:1) 1 . Fractions of 2 mL or 1 mL were collected and those enriched in actin - dimer , - trimer or - tetramer were identiﬁed by SDS / PAGE , pooled and concentrated with Millipore concentrators . When necessary , pooled fractions of oligomer samples were subjected to a second puriﬁcation step using a Sephacryl 300 FPLC ( 16 / 60 ) column . The N - terminal fragments of human cytosolic gelsolin comprising either only segment 1 ( G1 ) or segments 1 – 3 ( G1 – 3 ) were obtained recombinantly [ 15 ] . Subfragment 1 of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin was prepared by chymotryptic cleavage of myosin ﬁlaments obtained by precipitation of isolated myosin in low ionic strength buffer and further puri - ﬁed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE - cellulose to separate myosin subfragment 1 containing either the essen - tial light chain A1 or both A1 and A2 [ 41 , 42 ] . Myosin - S1 was labelled with 5 - iodoacetamido - ﬂuoresceine as described [ 29 ] . Excess and unbound label was removed by gel ﬁltration over a Sephadex G25 column . Analytical procedures Protein concentrations were determined either by the col - orimetric assay [ 43 ] or for G - actin by measuring the optical density at 290 nm ( OD 290 nm of 0 . 63 = 1 mg (cid:3) mL (cid:1) 1 ) [ 17 ] . SDS / PAGE was used to check the purity of prepared pro - teins [ 44 ] . ADP - ribosylation of actin - oligomers was per - formed as reported previously using 0 . 4 m M NAD or etheno - NAD and 12 l g iota toxin per mg actin for 5 h at room temperature [ 25 ] . To measure polymerization kinetics we employed pyreny - lated monomeric actin , which was prepared by modifying Cys374 by pyrenyl - iodoacetamide [ 45 ] . The ﬂuorescence increase during copolymerization of 0 . 25 l M pyrene - G - actin with 2 . 5 l M isolated actin - oligomers was determined ﬂuoro - metrically using a Schimadzu RF 5001 - PC spectroﬂuorome - ter at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 385 nm , respectively , at 22 ° C . Polymerization was started by addition of 2 m M MgCl 2 assuming that the ﬂuorescence increase was due to copolymerization of pyrene - actin with the oligomers . The ﬂuorescence changes induced by actin binding to IAF - myosin - S1 were determined at wavelength settings of 490 nm and 520 nm for excitation and emission , respectively . In initial experiments mantADP release from myosin subfragment 1 was determined using the same spec - troﬂuorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 455 nm , respectively , making use of the ﬂuores - cence energy transfer ( FRET ) from myosin - S1 tryptophane to bound mantADP [ 25 ] . The Mg 2 + - dependent ATPase activity of myosin - S1 was determined spectroscopically at 25 ° C in HEPES - buffer supplemented with 2 m M MgCl 2 by a linked assay system using pyruvate kinase to rephosphorylate the generated ADP and the formed pyruvate was converted into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase reducing NAD to NADH [ 46 , 47 ] . The ATPase - assay was performed at 25 ° C in a ﬁnal vol - ume of 250 l L HEPES - buffer supplemented with 2 m M phosphoenolpyruvate and 0 . 4 m M NADH , 1 m M ATP plus a mixture of pyruvate - kinase and lactate - dehydrogenase resulting in an activity between 50 and 100 units each according to the data of the manufacturer ( Sigma ) . The reaction was started by addition of myosin - S1 to the test solution and after two min F - actin or the oligomers was added to the concentrations given in the ﬁgures . The decrease in NADH concentration in the linked enzyme - assay was determined in a Beckman DU 640 spectrometer and followed up for at least 2 min . In order to calculate the amount of ATP hydrolysed an extinction coefﬁcient at 340 nm of 6 . 22 m M (cid:1) 1 and cm (cid:1) 1 NADH [ 48 ] was employed . Stopped - ﬂow measurements The ﬂuorescence changes following mantADP release from myosin - S1 and after binding of phalloidin - stabilized F - actin or ADP - ribosylated trimer in complex with G1 to IAF - myosin - S1 were also determined by fast reaction kinetics using a stopped - ﬂow set - up in HEPES - buffer supplemented with 2 m M MgCl 2 . A SFM 400 instrument ( Bio - Logic , Seyssinet - Pariset , France ) was employed with the 2 mm path length cuvette and syringes thermostated to 20 ° C . Using a Xenon lamp and a monochromator the solutions containing mantADP were excited at 360 nm and the ﬂuo - rescence light was detected after passing a 420 nm cut - off ﬁlter . Solutions containing IAF - myosin - S1 were excited at 485 nm and the emitted light was ﬁltered with a 495 nm cut - off . Each experiment was repeated 5 to 10 times . A double - exponential equation was ﬁtted to the recorded ﬂuo - rescence traces . Electron microscopy and single particle analysis Routine negative staining of actin samples using 1 % uranyl acetate was performed on grids with holey plastic ﬁlm [ 49 ] covered with 4 nm carbon ﬁlm and glow discharged in O 2 / H 2 gas using Solarus950 plasma cleaning system ( GATAN , Pleasanton , CA , USA ) . These grids allowed analysing 1726 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 1715 – 1729 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Actin oligomer isolation and myosin subfragment 1 interaction Z .

Digital micrographs were then recorded with a Zeiss trans - mission electron microscope EM923 run at 120 kV ﬁtted with a TemCamF416 camera ( Tietz Video and Image Pro - cessing Systems , Gauting , Germany ) . For single particle analysis about 2500 particles were manually picked from 106 micrographs , 1924 particles were 2D - classiﬁed into eight classes and used to produce an ini - tial model ( Fig . 6C ) using EMAN 2 . 1 beta - 4 ( National Center for Macromolecular Imaging , Houston , USA ) [ 32 ] . Fitting was done in a two - step procedure : First the soft - ware packages SITUS / SCULPTOR ( [ 33 , 34 ] Wahle and Wriggers , 2015 ; www . biomachina . org ) were used to ﬁnd a Voronoi feature extraction , which was then used for automatic ﬁt - ting . This procedure did not result in a unique ﬁt as the noise level of the reconstruction is at present still too high . Furthermore , an additional density for gelsolin - G1 is not represented in the reconstruction of the molecular models . In a second step the possible ﬁts were manually screened for matching of the Voronoi centres of the helical actin tri - mer arrangement , which then resulted in the shown prelimi - nary ﬁtting ( all work interactively in visualization software CHIMERA [ 35 ] , Fig . 6C ) . For ﬁtting we used the actin from the DNase I complex ( PDB accession number : 1ATN [ 33 ] ) and the myosinV motor domain was taken from [ 7 ] , for which the PDB accession is still in preparation , but almost identical to the previously published crystal structure of myosinV motor domain in the absence of nucleotide ( PDB accession number : 1OE9 [ 50 ] ) .
