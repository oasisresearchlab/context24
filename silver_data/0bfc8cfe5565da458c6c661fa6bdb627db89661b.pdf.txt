Brief Communication 611 The role of pre - and post - anaphase microtubules in the cytokinesis phase of the cell cycle Julie C . Canman , David B . Hoffman and E . D . Salmon The cytokinesis phase , or C phase , of the cell cycle results in the separation of one cell into two daughter cells after the completion of mitosis . Although it is known that microtubules are required for proper positioning of the cytokinetic furrow [ 1 , 2 ] , the role of pre - anaphase microtubules in cytokinesis has not been clearly defined for three key reasons . First , inducing microtubule depolymerization or stabilization before the onset of anaphase blocks entry into anaphase and cytokinesis via the spindle checkpoint [ 3 ] . Second , microtubule organization changes rapidly at anaphase onset as the mitotic kinase , Cdc2 – cyclin B , is inactivated [ 4 ] . Third , the time between the onset of anaphase and the initiation of cytokinesis is very short , making it difficult to unambiguously alter microtubule polymer levels before cytokinesis , but after inactivation of the spindle checkpoint . Here , we have taken advantage of the discovery that microinjection of antibodies to the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2 ( mitotic arrest deficient ) in prometaphase abrogates the spindle checkpoint , producing premature chromosome separation , segregation , and normal cytokinesis [ 5 , 6 ] . To test the role of pre - anaphase microtubules in cytokinesis , microtubules were disassembled in prophase and prometaphase cells , the cells were then injected with anti - Mad2 antibodies and recorded through C phase . The results show that exit from mitosis in the absence of microtubules triggered a 50 minute period of cortical contractility that was independent of microtubules . Furthermore , upon microtubule reassembly during this contractile C - phase period , ~ 30 % of the cells underwent chromosome poleward movement , formed a midzone microtubule complex , and completed cytokinesis .

Results and discussion Cells injected with anti - Mad2 antibodies while in nocodazole enter and exit C phase C phase and M phase have traditionally been grouped together , with cytokinesis as the final step of mitosis . However , in some organisms , such as Schizosaccha - romyces pombe [ 7 ] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 8 ] , cytokinesis can be uncoupled from M phase . Furthermore , M phase is not always followed by C phase . Early Drosophila embryos , for example , undergo multiple rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis , resulting in the formation of a syncitium . Pre - sumably , one of the essential steps in C phase is to prepare the cell cortex for the state of contractility associated with cytokinesis . We found that the timing and progression of microtubule and actin cytoskeletal changes are normal in PtK 1 cells injected with anti - Mad2 antibodies ( J . C . C . and E . D . S . , unpublished observations ; see also [ 5 , 6 ] ) . There - fore , we sought to define the contractile behavior of the cortex after anaphase onset in the absence of microtubules . Prophase and prometaphase PtK 1 cells were pretreated with 10 m M nocodazole to depolymerize all microtubules ( data not shown ) , microinjected with anti - Mad2 antibodies , and then recorded by time - lapse phase - contrast microscopy . Control cells were not pretreated with nocoda - zole before antibody injection and they underwent normal cytokinesis , finishing about 30 minutes after anaphase onset ( Figure 1 , upper row ) . However , the cortex of noco - dazole - pretreated cells became contractile soon after anaphase onset ( Figure 1 , bottom row ) . Although a few cells formed transient circumferential furrows ( data not shown ) , the majority of the cells contracted without obvious direction . About 50 minutes after the onset of con - tractility ( 52 ± 9 minutes , n = 6 ; see Figure 1 ) , the cells respread without dividing , indicating exit from C phase . This was not merely an artifact of extended recording , as uninjected cells treated with nocodazole did not respread ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , by preventing cytokinesis with cytochalasin treatment , which inhibits actin polymer - ization , others have found a similar time - frame for the cyto - kinetic ability of mammalian cells [ 9 ] . These cells were able to undergo cytokinesis if cytochalasin was washed out within one hour after anaphase onset , but not if drug washout occurred after an hour had elapsed . The fact that the anti - Mad2 antibodies induced cortical contractility for a finite period in mammalian cells treated with nocodazole is of particular interest for defining C phase as a discrete phase of the cell cycle . The timing of C phase exit in noco - dazole - treated cells was longer than the timing in cells induced to enter C phase without nocodazole pretreatment bb10j55 . qxd 10 / 5 / 00 2 : 14 pm Page 611 ( Figure 1 ) . Perhaps this difference permits the correction of mistakes in cytokinesis or furrow positioning , allowing cells to form a cytokinetic furrow in the correct plane ( as was reported for echinoderm embryos [ 10 , 11 ] ) . Nocodazole washout of anti - Mad2 antibody - injected cells after anaphase onset but before the exit from C phase To test whether cells can accomplish cytokinesis without a pre - anaphase spindle and / or astral microtubules , prophase and early prometaphase PtK 1 cells were treated with 10 m M nocodazole for 10 – 20 minutes to depolymer - ize all of the microtubules ( data not shown ) , microin - jected with anti - Mad2 antibodies to induce anaphase onset , and recorded by time - lapse phase - contrast microscopy . Cells were then maintained in nocodazole for ~ 20 – 30 minutes to allow for progression into C phase , and then released from nocodazole treatment during the middle of C phase ( Figure 2a ) . Cytokinesis was observed 612 Current Biology Vol 10 No 10 Figure 1 Microtubules are not required for C phase .

No cytokinesis was seen in cells not released from nocodazole ( Figure 2b , upper row ) . Without nocodazole washout during C phase , cells did not grow microtubules or form stem bodies ( Figure 3 , upper row ) . To test whether cells could form a midzone microtubule complex after release from nocodazole in C phase , cells were fixed ~ 25 minutes after nocodazole washout ( Figure 2a ) . In cells that underwent cytokinesis , a normal midzone microtubule complex was observed , as determined by anti - tubulin staining ( Figure 3 , bottom row ) . Interestingly , in cells that did not complete cyto - kinesis , stem body microtubule bundles were observed in the area around the chromosomes ( Figure 3 , center row ) . In addition , we found colocalization of filamentous ( f ) - actin in the general area of these bundles ( Figure 3 , center row ) . This indicates a potential link between the position of the stem bodies and f - actin localization , but further experiments must be done to test this hypothesis . Together , the above results demonstrate that cells are capable of forming a cytokinetic furrow and a midzone complex or stem bodies without a pre - anaphase spindle and / or astral microtubule array ( Figures 2b and 3 ) .

Cells were either fixed in nocodazole ( top row ) , or fixed after post - anaphase washout of nocodazole ( center and bottom rows ) . Cells were stained with anti - tubulin antibodies , Alexa 488 – phalloidin , and DAPI to visualize microtubules , f - actin and DNA , respectively . The resulting images were color - encoded to determine the position of each polymer relative to the others : DNA , blue ; tubulin , green ; f - actin , red . The cells that were not released from nocodazole did not have a microtubule array at the time of fixation ( top row ) . Cells that were released from nocodazole treatment were able to reform microtubules ( center and bottom rows ) . Some cells did not complete cytokinesis following drug release ( center row ) , yet there appeared to be bundles of microtubules associated with the chromosomes ( see center far right color image ) . However , ~ 30 % of cells that were released from nocodazole after anaphase onset were capable of forming cytokinetic furrows ( bottom row ) . DNA was often separated into two masses in cells that underwent cytokinesis ( bottom row ) . Green and red arrows indicate stem body microtubule bundles and actin respectively .

In PtK 1 cells treated with nocodazole , the centrosomes are not always physically separated ( data not shown ) . As monopolar cells do not undergo cytokinesis [ 5 ] , it is possible that the cen - trosomes must be a certain distance apart from one another in order to form a bipolar microtubule structure . This could explain why some cells underwent cytokinesis upon nocodazole washout , while others did not . To support this hypothesis , cells that underwent cytokinesis also separated their chromosomes into two masses , indi - cating the formation of a bipolar structure . The current model for the formation of the midzone microtubule complex in anaphase involves the sliding of pre - existing microtubules along spindle fibers toward the equator [ 12 ] . It is also possible that the midzone micro - tubule complex is formed de novo , as suggested by the immunolocalization of g - tubulin at the midzone micro - tubule complex [ 13 ] . Our results indicate that a normal midzone microtubule complex can form in cells that never had a pre - anaphase spindle and / or astral array . However , these cells did form a bipolar microtubule structure after drug washout ( Figure 3 , bottom row ) . Therefore , we cannot rule out the possibility that the midzone micro - tubule complex forms via sliding of polymerized micro - tubules after anaphase onset . Materials and methods PtK 1 cells were grown as described previously [ 6 ] . Antibodies were affinity purified against XMad2 [ 14 ] as described in [ 6 ] . To be effective at inducing anaphase , some fractions of antibody required the addition of 1 – 5 mg / ml bovine serum albumin to decrease antibody absorption by the injection needle . Cells were filmed by time - lapse phase - contrast microscopy , as described previously [ 6 ] . All nocodazole experiments were done by pre - treating coverslips for 10 – 20 min with 10 m M noco - dazole before injection . These conditions are sufficient to depolymerize all pre - anaphase microtubules , as determined by microtubule immuno - fluorescence assays ( data not shown ) . For cell fixation , all rinses were done by three or more changes of buffer within 15 min . All permeabi - lizations , fixations , and rinses were done in coplin jars . Cells were per - meabilized in PHEM ( 18 . 14 g PIPES pH 7 . 0 , 6 . 5 g Hepes , 3 . 8 g EGTA , 0 . 99 g MgSO 4 in 1 l ) containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( PHEM - T ) for 5 min . The cells were then fixed for 20 min in fresh 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 5 % EM grade glutaraldehyde made in PHEM . After rinsing , the glutaraldeyde fixation reaction was quenched with 1 mg / ml of NaBH 4 in PHEM . After further rinsing , the coverslips were blocked with 5 % boiled donkey serum for 1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C . Primary anti - tubulin antibodies , Alexa 488 – Phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) and DAPI were used to visualize microtubules , f - actin and DNA , respec - tively . The coverslips were mounted in mounting media ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 % N - propyl gallate , 90 % glycerol ) . Optical sections of fluo - rescently labeled cells were obtained using a multi - mode digital imaging system as described previously [ 15 ] .
