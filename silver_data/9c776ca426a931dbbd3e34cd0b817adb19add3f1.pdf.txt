From the cytosol , the virus transports to the nucleus , enabling transcription and replication of the viral genome that leads to lytic infection or cellular transformation . How PyV exploits the ERAD machinery to cross the ER membrane and access the cytosol , a decisive infection step , remains enigmatic . However , recent studies have slowly unraveled many aspects of this process . These emerging insights should advance our efforts to develop more effective therapies against PyV - induced human diseases . Keywords : polyomavirus ; SV40 ; ERAD ; protein aggregation ; membrane penetration 1 . Introduction Polyomaviruses ( PyVs ) are small non - enveloped DNA tumor viruses belonging to the Polyomaviridae family . The ﬁrst two human PyVs , JC and BK PyV , were discovered in 1971 [ 1 , 2 ] . Since then , an additional 11 human PyVs have been uncovered [ 3 – 5 ] , including some more prominent viruses such as the Merkel cell PyV , the causative agent of an aggressive skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma [ 6 ] . PyVs are highly prevalent in the human population , with some such as the BK PyV estimated to infect up to approximately 90 % of the human population [ 3 , 7 – 9 ] . Although PyV infections are generally benign in healthy immunocompetent individuals , they pose a signiﬁcant threat to immunocompromised patients [ 9 ] . For instance , BK PyV , the causative agent of PyV - associated nephropathy [ 8 ] , becomes problematic in transplant patients . Because no therapies currently exist for PyV - associated nephropathy , treatment requires reducing immunosuppressants , which often leads to graft rejection . As another example , JC PyV is a neurotropic virus that causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system [ 10 ] . In immunocompromised patients such as in patients infected by human immunodeﬁciency virus and suffering acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , JC PyV - induced PML is rather common . Despite the fact that PyVs were discovered 45 years ago , effective treatments are currently lacking . However , recent advances in PyV research have made therapeutic development a realistic possibility . In this review , we will discuss host entry of the PyV simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) due to the wealth of available information ; where relevant , other PyVs will also be described . SV40 is the archetype PyV , displaying both genetic and structural similarity to human PyVs . Structurally , SV40 contains a circular doubled - stranded DNA genome of approximately ﬁve kilobases that encodes seven genes , three structural genes called VP1 , VP2 , VP3 , and four non - structural genes called VP4 , large T antigen , small T antigen , and agno protein [ 3 , 5 , 9 , 11 ] . As a non - enveloped virus , SV40 lacks a Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / v8090242 www . mdpi . com / journal / viruses Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 2 of 14 surrounding envelope and instead contains a protein capsid composed of 360 VP1 copies arranged as 72 pentamers that are displayed on the viral surface ( Figure 1A ) . The pentamers are stabilized by disulﬁde bonds , as well as by interactions between the VP1 carboxy - terminus , which invades a neighboring pentamer [ 12 , 13 ] . VP1 also associates with the underlying internal hydrophobic proteins VP2 and VP3 , which along with VP1 , bind to the genome [ 14 ] . When fully assembled , SV40 is approximately 45 – 50 nm in diameter [ 5 , 9 , 12 ] . To infect cells , SV40 ﬁrst binds to the glycolipid receptor ganglioside GM1 on the cell surface [ 15 – 17 ] , becomes internalized , and trafﬁcs to the endolysosomes ( Figure 1B , step 1 ; [ 18 ] ) . The virus then sorts to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) using a lipid - directed mechanism ( Figure 1B , step 2 ; [ 15 , 19 , 20 ] ) , from where it ejects across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol ( Figure 1B , step 3 ) . Upon reaching the cytosol , SV40 mobilizes to the nucleus ( Figure 1B , step 4 ) , where ensuing transcription and replication of the viral genome causes lytic infection or cellular transformation [ 21 , 22 ] . Although SV40 ER - to - cytosol membrane penetration—a decisive infection step—is not entirely understood , key concepts and players involved in this pathway are slowly being unraveled [ 23 ] . The emerging central principle posits that SV40 hijacks elements of a major cellular protein quality control pathway called ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) during its ER membrane penetration . Viruses 2016 , 9 , 242 2 of 14 small T antigen , and agno protein [ 3 , 5 , 9 , 11 ] . As a non ‐ enveloped virus , SV40 lacks a surrounding envelope and instead contains a protein capsid composed of 360 VP1 copies arranged as 72 pentamers that are displayed on the viral surface ( Figure 1A ) . The pentamers are stabilized by disulfide bonds , as well as by interactions between the VP1 carboxy ‐ terminus , which invades a neighboring pentamer [ 12 , 13 ] . VP1 also associates with the underlying internal hydrophobic proteins VP2 and VP3 , which along with VP1 , bind to the genome [ 14 ] .

To infect cells , SV40 first binds to the glycolipid receptor ganglioside GM1 on the cell surface [ 15 – 17 ] , becomes internalized , and traffics to the endolysosomes ( Figure 1B , step 1 ; [ 18 ] ) . The virus then sorts to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) using a lipid ‐ directed mechanism ( Figure 1B , step 2 ; [ 15 , 19 , 20 ] ) , from where it ejects across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol ( Figure 1B , step 3 ) .

The emerging central principle posits that SV40 hijacks elements of a major cellular protein quality control pathway called ER ‐ associated degradation ( ERAD ) during its ER membrane penetration .

These ER - folding clients often represent proteins that are destined for secretion along the classical secretory pathway , which is physically connected to the ER . During co - translational translocation of nascent polypeptide chains into the ER , the nascent polypeptide is transported across the ER membrane by crossing the Sec61 translocation channel [ 24 ] . In the ER , numerous ER luminal chaperones , post - translational modiﬁers , and folding catalysts assist in the protein folding process . For instance , carbohydrates are appended to a nascent polypeptide by the oligosaccharyl - transferase ( OST ) complex [ 25 ] , while disulﬁde bonds of the polypeptide are formed and rearranged by members of the protein disulﬁde isomerase ( PDI ) family [ 26 ] . Moreover , to prevent a polypeptide chain from aggregation and render it soluble , molecular chaperones such as the 70 kDa heat shock protein ( Hsc70 ) ATPase binding immunoglobulin protein ( BiP ) are recruited to the folding intermediate [ 27 ] . These coordinated efforts enable the polypeptide to attain its native conﬁguration and proper oligomeric state . Once formed and assembled , a folded polypeptide is packaged into coat protein complex II ( COPII ) vesicles and exits the ER en route for secretion . Because approximately one third of all mammalian genes encode proteins that are translocated into the ER , it is not surprising that the ER maintains a quality control system that prevents the generation of misfolded or aggregated ER proteins , and has the capacity to actively remove these aberrant species should they form . Over the past two decades , ERAD has been identiﬁed as the key ER quality control process dedicated to the removal of misfolded ER proteins [ 28 , 29 ] . During ERAD , misfolded ER clients are recognized and ejected into the cytosol where they are in turn degraded by the ubiquitin - dependent proteasome machinery . Conceptually , the quality control process can be divided into four distinct steps : substrate recognition , retro - translocation across the ER membrane , substrate polyubiquitination , and proteasomal degradation ( Figure 2 ) .

During ERAD , misfolded ER clients are recognized and ejected into the cytosol where they are in turn degraded by the ubiquitin ‐ dependent proteasome machinery . Conceptually , the quality control process can be divided into four distinct steps : substrate recognition , retro ‐ translocation across the ER membrane , substrate polyubiquitination , and proteasomal degradation ( Figure 2 ) . Figure 2 . ER ‐ associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway . ERAD is an ER quality control pathway that identifies and triages misfolded ER proteins . In the first step , a misfolded protein is recognized by ER ‐ resident chaperones , which target the misfolded client to the retro ‐ translocation machinery on the ER membrane ( step 1 ) . Next the misfolded client is retro ‐ translocated across the ER membrane by Figure 2 . ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway . ERAD is an ER quality control pathway that identiﬁes and triages misfolded ER proteins . In the ﬁrst step , a misfolded protein is recognized by ER - resident chaperones , which target the misfolded client to the retro - translocation machinery on the ER membrane ( step 1 ) . Next the misfolded client is retro - translocated across the ER membrane by crossing the retro - translocation channel ( step 2 ) ; a major component of this channel is the Sel1L - Hrd1 membrane complex . When the client emerges into the cytosol , it is ubiquitinated by the catalytic domain of Hrd1 that faces the cytosol , eventually resulting in polyubiquitinaton of the substrate ( step 3 ) . In the ﬁnal step , the client is extracted into the cytosol by p97 ( and its cofactors ) , and delivered to the proteasome for degradation ( step 4 ) . Sel1L : protein sel - 1 homolog 1 ; Hrd1 : E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase synoviolin ; Poly ( Ub ) n : polyubiquitin chain ; RING : Really Interesting New Gene ﬁnger domain . Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 4 of 14 In the ﬁrst step , a misfolded ER luminal ( or transmembrane ) client is identiﬁed ( Figure 2 , step 1 ) . Identiﬁcation is accomplished through recognition of improper carbohydrate residues or erroneous disulﬁde bond pairing , resulting in aberrant exposure of hydrophobic patches or oligomer formation in a misfolded polypeptide . ER - resident factors including protein disulﬁde isomerase ( PDI ) family members [ 26 ] , BiP [ 30 , 31 ] , and enzymes involved in carbohydrate recognition and processing such as ER class I α - mannosidase ( ER ManI ) [ 32 ] , ER degradation - enhancing α - mannosidase - like ( EDEM ) 1 / 3 [ 33 ] , and osteosarcoma ampliﬁed 9 / ( OS - 9 / XTP3 ) [ 34 – 36 ] , all serve critical roles during this initial committed step of the ERAD pathway . Once identiﬁed , the misfolded polypeptide is targeted to a protein - conducting channel that retro - translocates the substrate from the ER into the cytosol ( Figure 2 , step 2 ) . Although pinpointing the identity of this “retrotranslocon” remains a major challenge , recent studies suggest that the multi - pass ER transmembrane protein called E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase Hrd1 ( synoviolin ) is a strong candidate [ 37 – 39 ] ; other components such as the Hrd1 - interacting partners called Derlins have also been implicated [ 40 , 41 ] . Before a misfolded client engages Hrd1 , it is ﬁrst delivered to another Hrd1 - associated membrane factor called protein sel - 1 homolog 1 ( Sel1L ) , which is generally thought to act as a substrate acceptor during ERAD [ 42 ] . Sel1L in turn “hands off” a client to Hrd1 , preparing the client for transport across the ER membrane . It is important to note that Hrd1 itself is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that displays its so - called catalytic Really Interesting New Gene ( RING ) - ﬁnger domain towards the cytosol . This is an important structural feature because ubiquitination plays at least two distinct functions during ERAD : Hrd1 - triggered autoubiquitination of its RING - ﬁnger domain appears to gate its channel activity [ 39 ] , while Hrd1’s ability to facilitate substrate ubiquitination plays an essential role in substrate extraction from the ER membrane ( see below ) . During the third ERAD step ( Figure 2 , step 3 ) , Hrd1 operates in conjunction with E2 conjugating enzymes such as ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme E2 , G2 ( Ube2g2 ) and E2 , J1 ( Ube2j1 ) [ 43 , 44 ] to promote ubiquitination of lysine residues in a misfolded client that has emerged into the cytosol ; additional rounds of ubiquitination subsequently generate a polyubiquitin chain . There is evidence that serine , threonine , and cysteine residues can also serve as the ubiquitination sites [ 45 ] . Regardless , polyubiquitination is thought to prevent “back - sliding” of the client into the ER lumen , thereby favoring client release into the cytosol . Passive release of the polyubiquitinated substrate into the cytosol does not occur , but instead is catalyzed by cytosolic chaperones that actively extract the substrate . This is primarily accomplished by the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities ( AAA ) ATPase p97 , which functions in a concerted manner with its co - factors ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 ( Ufd1 ) and nuclear protein localization protein 4 ( Npl4 ) [ 46 ] . In the last step of ERAD ( Figure 2 , step 4 ) , the polyubiquitinated substrate is delivered to the proteasome for destruction . Delivery to the proteasome likely involves a recently discovered holdase complex consisting of BCL2 associated athanogene 6 ( Bag6 ) , ubiquitin - like protein 4A ( Ubl4a ) , transmembrane domain recognition complex 35 ( Trc35 ) , and small glutamine - rich tetratricopeptide repeat - containing protein alpha ( SGTA ) that prevents the misfolded client from aggregation in the cytosol [ 47 , 48 ] . Upon reaching the proteasome , deubiquitination and unfolding activities associated with the proteasome machinery remove the polyubiquitin chain and unfold the substrate . These reactions allow a misfolded client to properly thread through the central chamber of the proteasome so that hydrolysis of the polypeptide chain can ensue [ 49 ] . While ERAD’s ability to rectify the protein - misfolding problem is essential to maintain overall cellular protein homeostasis ( proteostasis ) , its central feature—presence of a physical conduit between the ER luminal and cytosolic space—can be exploited during pathogen - host interactions . And indeed , nowhere is this more evident than during ER - to - cytosol membrane penetration by SV40 . Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 5 of 14 3 . How SV40 Hijacks Elements of ERAD during ER Membrane Transport 3 . 1 . ER Luminal Events After trafﬁcking to the ER , SV40 is thought to disguise as a “misfolded” substrate , co - opting components of the ERAD machinery in order to penetrate the ER membrane and reach the cytosol . To do so , it ﬁrst undergoes conformational changes that partially uncoat the virus . This conformational change generates a hydrophobic viral particle that binds to and inserts into the ER membrane , a step required for successful membrane transport . Multiple PDI family members impart SV40 structural alterations in the ER , including PDI , ERp57 , and ERdj5 ( Figure 3A , step 1 ; [ 50 – 52 ] ) ; there is evidence that ERdj5 also executes an important role during BK PyV infection [ 52 ] . In the case of the murine PyV , another PDI family member called ERp29 was found to locally unfold the VP1 carboxy - terminal arm [ 53 , 54 ] , a reaction that in conjunction with PDI and ERp57 [ 51 , 55 ] generates a hydrophobic virus by exposing the internal hydrophobic proteins VP2 and VP3 [ 56 , 57 ] . Of note , the PDI - ERp57 - ERp29 triad has also been reported to act on JC PyV during infection [ 58 ] . Uncoating of SV40 ( and other PyVs ) by PDI family members exposes the underlying hydrophobic proteins VP2 and VP3 . While the newly - generated hydrophobic viral particle can engage and integrate into the hydrophobic ER membrane , this virus is also prone to aggregation that can result from non - productive self interactions via previously hidden viral hydrophobic regions . To prevent aggregation , BiP is recruited to the virus [ 59 , 60 ] , similar to its role in avoiding aggregation of a misfolded client during ERAD [ 27 ] . BiP’s ability to engage SV40 ( and other cellular substrates ) is strictly dependent on its nucleotide - bound states [ 61 ] . In the adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) - bound form , BiP has a high afﬁnity for its substrate , while adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) - BiP displays a low substrate - binding afﬁnity . J - proteins activate BiP’s intrinsic ATPase activity , converting ATP - BiP to ADP - BiP . By contrast , nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ) release ADP from ADP - BiP , enabling ATP to re - engage BiP and generate ATP - BiP . In this context , the ER - resident J - protein ERdj3 ( also called B11 ) was found to promote SV40 ER membrane transport by stimulating SV40 - BiP interaction ( Figure 3A , step 2 ; [ 60 ] ) , presumably after hydrophobic proteins VP2 and VP3 are exposed . When the SV40 - BiP complex is proximal to the luminal surface of the ER membrane , the virus must be released from BiP in order to initiate ER membrane transport . Of the two established ER luminal NEFs , only glucose - regulated protein 170 kDa ( Grp170 ) , but not Sil1 , promotes SV40 release from BiP in order to prime the virus for membrane penetration ( Figure 3A , step 3 ; [ 62 ] ) . Grp170 was also shown to bind directly to the Hrd1 adapter Sel1L [ 63 ] . This positions Grp170 next to the ER membrane , suggesting that SV40 release from BiP occurs proximal to the membrane . Such a scenario raises the possibility that release of the virus from BiP is coupled to membrane transport . Interestingly , only Sel1L [ 50 ] but not Hrd1 [ 59 ] plays a role in SV40 and JC PyV infection [ 58 ] . Why this is the case is unclear , but there is the possibility that Sel1L might operate independent of Hrd1 in some instances . For instance , there may exist a pool of Sel1L that does not bind to Hrd1 . Instead , this Sel1L pool might recruit previously uncharacterized ER ( or possibly cytosolic ) proteins that promote PyV infection . Perhaps one rational approach to tackle this possibility is to isolate the Sel1L pool that does not associate with Hrd1 , and carefully dissect potential Sel1L - binding partners using this pool . While not identical for all PyV family members , a clear theme has come into focus for ER luminal events initiating the membrane transport process . Speciﬁcally , upon reaching the ER from the plasma membrane , the virus initially undergoes conformational changes induced by ERAD factors such as the PDI family members—these reactions expose the inner hydrophobic VP2 and VP3 proteins and generate a hydrophobic viral particle . The hydrophobic virus is prevented from aggregation by the recruitment of ERAD molecular chaperones such as BiP . In the ﬁnal phase , the hydrophobic virus disengages from the molecular chaperone , binds to and inserts into the ER membrane , and is now primed for penetration across the lipid bilayer . Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 6 of 14 Viruses 2016 , 9 , 242 6 of 14 3 . 2 . ER Membrane Events When the hydrophobic SV40 particle inserts into the ER membrane , the amino ‐ terminal region of the exposed VP2 protein binds to an ER membrane protein called B ‐ cell receptor ‐ associated protein 31 ( BAP31 ) ( Figure 3B , step 1 ; [ 59 ] ) , which is thought to stabilize the membrane ‐ embedded virus . Additional ER membrane components such as the Derlins have also been reported to mediate ER ‐ to ‐ cytosol transport of SV40 [ 50 ] , as well as the murine PyV [ 64 ] , and BK PyV [ 65 ] . However , the precise molecular contribution of Derlins to the membrane penetration event is unclear . Figure 3 . ER ‐ to ‐ cytosol membrane penetration of SV40 . Penetration across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol is a decisive SV40 infection step . This process can be conceptually divided into ER lumenal , membrane , and cytosolic events . ( A ) During ER lumenal events , protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) family members impart conformational changes to SV40 , generating a hydrophobic viral particle by exposing its VP2 and VP3 hydrophobic proteins ( step 1 ) . This hydrophobic virus is maintained in a soluble state by interacting with ADP ‐ binding immunoglobulin protein ( BiP ) , which is formed by the action of the J ‐ protein ERdj3 ( step 2 ) . When the SV40 ‐ BiP complex is proximal to the ER membrane , the nucleotide exchange factor glucose ‐ regulated protein 170 kDa ( Grp170 ) induces nucleotide exchange of BiP , generating ATP ‐ BiP that releases SV40 ( step 3 ) . The hydrophobic SV40 in turn binds to and integrates into the ER membrane to initiate membrane transport . ( B ) During ER membrane events , the membrane ‐ embedded SV40 binds to the B ‐ cell receptor ‐ associated protein 31 ( BAP31 ) membrane protein ( step 1 ) , a step thought to stabilize the viral structural integrity . Concomitant with this step , SV40 also induces the lateral reorganization of different ER membrane proteins ( including BAP31 and the J ‐ proteins B12 , B14 , and C18 ) to form discrete puncta called foci ( step 2 ) —the foci structures are believed to represent the cytosol entry sites . How this virus induces foci formation is Figure 3 . ER - to - cytosol membrane penetration of SV40 . Penetration across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol is a decisive SV40 infection step . This process can be conceptually divided into ER lumenal , membrane , and cytosolic events . ( A ) During ER lumenal events , protein disulﬁde isomerase ( PDI ) family members impart conformational changes to SV40 , generating a hydrophobic viral particle by exposing its VP2 and VP3 hydrophobic proteins ( step 1 ) . This hydrophobic virus is maintained in a soluble state by interacting with ADP - binding immunoglobulin protein ( BiP ) , which is formed by the action of the J - protein ERdj3 ( step 2 ) . When the SV40 - BiP complex is proximal to the ER membrane , the nucleotide exchange factor glucose - regulated protein 170 kDa ( Grp170 ) induces nucleotide exchange of BiP , generating ATP - BiP that releases SV40 ( step 3 ) . The hydrophobic SV40 in turn binds to and integrates into the ER membrane to initiate membrane transport . ( B ) During ER membrane events , the membrane - embedded SV40 binds to the B - cell receptor - associated protein 31 ( BAP31 ) membrane protein ( step 1 ) , a step thought to stabilize the viral structural integrity . Concomitant with this step , SV40 also induces the lateral reorganization of different ER membrane proteins ( including BAP31 and the J - proteins B12 , B14 , and C18 ) to form discrete puncta called foci ( step 2 ) —the foci structures are believed to represent the cytosol entry sites . How this virus induces foci formation is not entirely understood . ( C ) During the cytosolic events , the J - proteins B12 / B14 / C18 recruit a cytosolic complex composed of 70 kDa heat shock protein ( Hsc70 ) , human heat shock protein 105 kDa ( Hsp105 ) , and small glutamine - rich tetratricopeptide repeat - containing protein alpha ( SGTA ) that extracts SV40 into the cytosol . The J - proteins ﬁrst convert Hsc70 to ADP - Hsc70 , allowing this chaperone to bind to SV40 . The nucleotide exchange factor Hsp105 changes ADP - Hsc70 to ATP - Hsc70 , which releases SV40 from Hsc70 . Because Hsp105 is also a bonaﬁde chaperone , it captures SV40 once the virus is released from Hsc70 . Iterative cycles of Hsc70 - Hsp105 binding to and release from SV40 is thought to extract SV40 into the cytosol . Hsp105 can also disassemble the virus , a reaction that may be coupled to the extraction process . SGTA’s precise function is unclear , but can either regulate Hsc70’s ability to engage SV40 , bring Hsc70 and Hsp105 in proximity due to its ability to dimerize , or catalyze an event post ER membrane penetration such as in facilitating cytosol - to - nucleus transport .

ER Membrane Events When the hydrophobic SV40 particle inserts into the ER membrane , the amino - terminal region of the exposed VP2 protein binds to an ER membrane protein called B - cell receptor - associated protein 31 ( BAP31 ) ( Figure 3B , step 1 ; [ 59 ] ) , which is thought to stabilize the membrane - embedded virus . Additional ER membrane components such as the Derlins have also been reported to mediate ER - to - cytosol transport of SV40 [ 50 ] , as well as the murine PyV [ 64 ] , and BK PyV [ 65 ] . However , the precise molecular contribution of Derlins to the membrane penetration event is unclear . In an unbiased RNA interference ( RNAi ) screen , three ER transmembrane J - proteins ( B12 , B14 , and C18 ) were found to be essential in promoting SV40 and BK PyV infection [ 60 ] . Of these J - proteins , B12 and B14 have been previously implicated in the ERAD process [ 66 – 68 ] . Not surprisingly , due to their localization to the ER membrane , B12 , B14 , and C18 regulate the decisive virus ER - to - cytosol membrane transport step [ 60 , 69 , 70 ] . Because these J - proteins display their catalytic J - domain towards the cytosol , part of their mechanism of action likely involves the recruitment of cytosolic Hsc70 and associated co - chaperones used to extract the virus into the cytosol ( see below ) . Interestingly , using a knockdown - rescue approach , all three J - proteins were shown to exert non - redundant roles during SV40 ER membrane penetration [ 70 ] . These results suggest that each J - protein imparts a unique function within the viral membrane transport pathway . One possibility is that an individual J - protein binds to a distinct set of luminal , membrane , or cytosolic partners that are all necessary to support the membrane transport process . An outstanding question is whether there are speciﬁc regions within the vast ER membrane , which is composed of a complicated network of sheets and tubules [ 71 ] , that serve as selective membrane penetration sites for the virus . To address this question , we and others reported that many of the ER membrane proteins that promote SV40 ER membrane transport , including BAP31 ( and the related BAP29 ) , B12 , B14 , and C18 , reorganize into distinct subdomains within the ER membrane called foci during SV40 infection ( Figure 3B , step 2 ; [ 59 , 69 , 70 , 72 ] ) ; SV40 itself also accumulates in these virus - induced foci [ 59 , 69 , 70 , 72 ] . Importantly , the VP2 / VP3 exposed , membrane penetration - competent form of SV40 is found predominantly in these punctate structures [ 70 ] . These collective ﬁndings suggest that virus - triggered foci represent viral cytosol entry sites from the ER . Consistent with this idea , the rate of foci formation was found to temporally parallel SV40 cytosol arrival from the ER [ 69 ] , SV40 mutants which cannot transfer across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol also fail to trigger foci formation [ 70 ] , and impairing SV40 release into the cytosol traps SV40 in the foci leading to expansion of the foci structure [ 72 ] . While these are compelling data to support the notion that SV40 possesses a unique ability to construct speciﬁc penetration sites on the ER membrane , the precise molecular mechanism by which the viral particle stimulates foci formation remains unclear . For instance , assuming that individual components of the foci structure must reorganize laterally within the ER lipid bilayer to generate the foci structure , how does SV40 exploit cellular mechanical forces to accomplish this difﬁcult feat ? Are these forces provided by additional ER luminal , membrane , or cytosolic factors during SV40 infection ? Clearly , clarifying the nature of the virus - induced foci , as well as elucidating its precise physiologic functions , deserves more attention . 3 . 3 . Cytosolic Events Although SV40 is partially uncoated when it penetrates the ER membrane , the size of these viral particles remains relatively large , with reports ranging from approximately 35 nm [ 59 ] up to 45 nm [ 52 , 73 ] in diameter . Thus it is unlikely that the membrane - inserted SV40 passively slips through the ER lipid bilayer to reach the cytosol . Instead , we postulate that a cytosolic extraction machinery “pulls” the viral particle into the cytosol . During ERAD , p97 normally provides the primary driving force to extract a misfolded client from the ER into the cytosol [ 46 ] . However , this cytosolic ATPase is not involved in SV40 infection [ 59 ] . Motivated by this observation , we used a classical biochemical approach to identify the putative cytosolic extraction machinery , guided by the basic premise that the membrane - bound J - proteins B12 , B14 , and C18 would recruit such a machinery . These efforts Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 8 of 14 pinpointed a cytosolic complex composed of Hsc70 , human heat shock protein 105 kDa ( Hsp105 ) , and SGTA that plays an essential role in ejecting SV40 into the cytosol [ 69 , 72 ] . Individual components of the Hsc70 - Hsp105 - SGTA complex are known to play a role during the cytosolic phase of ERAD [ 47 , 48 , 74 ] . While the precise mechanism by which this ternary complex coordinately extracts SV40 into the cytosol is not fully understood , a working model has nonetheless emerged . Via the action of the membrane - bound J proteins , Hsc70 is converted to the high - afﬁnity ADP - Hsc70 state . This enables Hsc70 to initially bind to the membrane - embedded SV40 ( Figure 3C , step 1 ) . As a NEF , Hsp105 then induces nucleotide exchange of Hsc70 , generating ATP - Hsc70 that releases the viral particle . In addition to acting as a NEF , Hsp105 is also an extended member of the Hsc70 ATPase superfamily that harbors a bonaﬁde chaperone activity [ 75 , 76 ] . Thus Hsp105 is able to capture SV40 once the virus disengages from Hsc70 ( Figure 3C , step 2 ) . When SV40 is released from Hsp105 , Hsc70 in turn re - binds the virus . Iterative rounds of Hsc70 - Hsp105 binding to and release from SV40 are thought to provide the major driving energy to extract the viral particle from the ER membrane . Strikingly , Hsp105 was reported to have a powerful disaggregation activity when it operates in concert with Hsc70 and a J - protein [ 77 – 79 ] . In line with this ﬁnding , our analyses demonstrate that Hsp105 can disaggregate the virus by removing the VP1 pentamers ( Figure 3C , step 3 ; [ 72 ] ) . Thus , Hsp105 in conjunction with Hsc70 and the membrane - bound J - proteins could act coordinately to disassemble the virus , generating a smaller SV40 species that facilitates viral release into the cytosol . The discovery that a disaggregation activity is used to drive cytosolic release of a virus from the ER immediately suggests that such an activity would be used during canonical ERAD . In this regard , many misfolded ER membrane proteins have been reported to aggregate [ 80 ] , raising the intriguing scenario that the Hsp105 - dependent disaggregation activity can be harnessed to disaggregate these clients prior to their release into the cytosol . Future experiments are needed to clarify this possibility . The ﬁnal member of the cytosolic extraction complex is SGTA [ 69 , 81 ] . This factor is a promiscuous cytosolic protein that plays diverse roles in many cellular pathways . For instance , SGTA exerts a critical function during ERAD , acting as a component of the Bag6 - Ubl4A - Trc35 - SGTA holdase complex that couples misfolded clients release from the ER and delivery to the proteasome ( Figure 2 ; [ 47 , 48 ] ) . Additionally , SGTA catalyzes an important step in the guided entry of tail - anchored proteins ( GET ) pathway , which inserts tail - anchored ( TA ) proteins from the cytosol into the ER membrane [ 82 , 83 ] . Conceptually , SGTA acts in a completely opposite manner within the GET pathway when compared to its role during SV40 extraction : in the GET pathway , SGTA delivers a hydrophobic protein from the cytosol to the ER , while it extracts a hydrophobic protein complex ( SV40 ) from the ER into the cytosol during SV40 infection . Precisely how SGTA assists Hsc70 and Hsp105 in ejecting SV40 into the cytosol , however , is not known ( Figure 3C , step 4 ) . Because SGTA is an established Hsc70 co - chaperone [ 84 , 85 ] , it may regulate Hsc70’s ability to engage SV40 . Alternatively , as SGTA exists as a dimer [ 86 ] , simultaneous binding of a SGTA dimer to one molecule of Hsc70 and one molecule of Hsp105 may bring Hsc70 and Hsp105 in close proximity to facilitate the extraction reaction . Of note , SGTA dimerization is necessary during proper androgen receptor signaling [ 87 ] . As one ﬁnal possibility , since SGTA has been reported to partially localize to the nucleus [ 88 ] , it may serve a dual role during SV40 infection—in this case , SGTA may promote both SV40 ER - to - cytosol transport as well as cytosol - to - nuclear transport . In addition to SV40 and BK PyV , SGTA also plays a role in other viral infection pathways , such as in HIV [ 89 ] , parvovirus [ 90 ] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ 91 ] infections , all of which have structural proteins that interact with SGTA’s central tetratricopeptide ( TPR ) domain repeats [ 92 ] . Because none of these viruses uses the ER - to - cytosol transport pathway for entry , SGTA appears to be exploited by other viruses for different purposes , consistent with its ability to function in numerous cellular pathways [ 85 ] . Viruses 2016 , 8 , 242 9 of 14 4 . Conclusions In this review , we describe in detail a decisive PyV infection step : penetration of the ER membrane that enables the virus to reach the cytosol . Although PyV infections are highly common in the human population and are generally thought to be benign , they can be especially problematic in immunocompromised individuals , such as in AIDS and transplant patients . Thus insights into the molecular basis by which PyVs enter host cells should allow us to develop more effective anti - viral therapies against PyV - induced human diseases including Merkel cell carcinoma , PML , and PyV - induced nephropathy . Our analyses revealed that elements of a major ER quality control pathway called ERAD are exploited by the archetype PyV SV40 , as well as other PyV family members , during ER membrane penetration . As chemical inhibitors of various components in the ERAD pathway have been reported [ 93 ] , the ability of these inhibitors to dampen PyV infection should be directly assessed . For instance , ERAD has been implicated in regulation of ﬂavivirus infection [ 94 – 98 ] . Not surprisingly , a recent study identiﬁed compounds known to disrupt the Hsc70 chaperone cycle were able to potently block ﬂavivirus infection [ 93 ] , consistent with the fact that this chaperone cycle controls ERAD . The connection between ERAD and SV40 also has broad implications . For example , the non - enveloped human papillomavirus ( HPV ) has been reported to trafﬁc to the ER from the cell surface [ 99 ] , and hijack various PDI family members during infection [ 100 ] . Thus it is tempting to speculate that HPV might use aspects of the ERAD machinery to access the cytosol , similar to strategies used by SV40 . A major gap in our understanding of non - enveloped virus entry is how they breach a host cell membrane to cause disease . For enveloped viruses such as HIV and inﬂuenza virus , fusion between the viral and host membranes delivers the core viral particle into the host cytosol [ 101 , 102 ] . By contrast , non - enveloped viruses such as PyV and HPV lack a surrounding membrane , and therefore must reach the cytosol using a fundamentally different mechanism . In the case of SV40 , one key principle is that host factors are exploited to create a hydrophobic particle that inserts into the ER membrane , a reaction that initiates the membrane penetration process . Whether this is a general strategy used by other non - enveloped viruses to cross biological membranes is unclear , and is an area of investigation worth pursuing . Another emerging principle is that SV40 appears to trigger formation of a speciﬁc membrane penetration site on the ER membrane ( called foci ) that enables the viral particle to access the cytosol . If true , this would be the ﬁrst instance of a viral particle that selectively builds a physical structure through which it crosses a host membrane . How this penetration structure is systematically constructed in the ER membrane deserves more attention , and is a question that can be addressed by application of high - resolution microscopy techniques . In sum , despite emerging insights into the overall PyV infection pathway , many critical questions remain . For instance , how does the virus mobilize to the nucleus after arrival to the cytosol ? Is the Hsc70 - Hsp105 - SGTA complex , known to be crucial during ER - to - cytosol membrane transport , also important during viral nuclear entry ? What are the viral structural states in the cytosol and upon entering the nucleus ? Addressing these and other critical questions will require further research . These insights will not only prove valuable in illuminating the PyV infection pathway , they should unveil additional therapeutic targets that can be used to better combat the plethora of PyV - induced human diseases .
