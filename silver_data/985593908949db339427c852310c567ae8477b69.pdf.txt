The trajectory of User In - terface ( UI ) development has experienced several pivotal shifts , starting with the inception of the Command Line Interface ( CLI ) in 1964 , and the subsequent introduction of the Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) in 1979 . By 2022 , elements reminiscent of the CLI had resurfaced in UI design , a trend epitomized by conversational agents such as ChatGPT . The current imperative is to devise an ad - vanced GUI iteration that seamlessly integrates with Generative AI applications . In pursuit of this , our study delves into various human - AI interaction modalities across a spectrum of task creativity and complexity to guide future GUI enhancements . Our research categorizes tasks into three escalating levels of creativity and complexity : fixed - scope content curation tasks like summarization , atomic creative tasks like analogy generation , and complex and interdependent tasks like data analysis visualization . Correspondingly , we explore a range of human - AI interaction meth - ods , from straightforward selection and rating to more involved guiding , post - editing , and interactive editing . This leads us to our research question : How do different facets of human - AI interaction correlate with the creative and complex nature of tasks ? 2 RELATED WORK Our examination of human - AI collaboration patterns is informed by Cheng et al . ’s taxonomy , which delineates five prevalent interac - tions in text summarization : guiding model output , selecting or rating model output , post - editing , interactive editing initiated by AI , and writing with model assistance initiated by humans [ 6 ] . My doctoral a r X i v : 2401 . 02494v1 [ c s . H C ] 4 J a n 2024 IUI ’24 Companion , March 18 – 21 , 2024 , Greenville , South Carolina , United States Zijian Ding research dissects these interactions across a spectrum of tasks , vary - ing from simple to complex and creative endeavors . This spectrum encompasses fixed - scope content curation tasks , atomic creative tasks , and complex and interdependent tasks ( refer to Figure 1 ) . 2 . 1 Fixed - scope Content Curation Tasks Substantial research demonstrates that Large Language Models ( LLMs ) adeptly manage defined content curation tasks such as text summarization [ 10 , 17 ] , content refinement [ 19 ] , and code expla - nation [ 20 ] . These tasks involve reiterating existing knowledge succinctly and coherently without generating novel insights . GPT - 3 and similar LLMs have shown proficiency in these tasks , often without the necessity for human intervention [ 4 ] . Clark et al . re - vealed that text generated by GPT - 3 was linguistically advanced to the extent that distinguishing it from human - written text be - came challenging for evaluators [ 8 ] . This calls for well - structured frameworks to dissect human and machine errors and ascertain au - thorship [ 14 ] . Such evidence underscores the potential for reducing human involvement in content curation tasks due to the superior quality of machine - generated text . 2 . 2 Atomic Creative Tasks The second category comprises atomic creative tasks that necessi - tate generating novel and valuable outputs [ 21 , 22 ] . These include tasks such as crafting analogies , metaphors , analogous design con - cepts [ 2 , 18 , 26 ] , slogans [ 9 ] , and tweetorials [ 16 ] . LLMs like GPT - 3 can foster novel connections or " creative leaps " due to their exten - sive knowledge base [ 5 ] . However , real creativity often requires domain - specific and nuanced knowledge that might be absent in LLM training data . Hence , to ensure quality , LLM outputs for these tasks must be guided , selected , or edited by humans through precise human - AI interactions . 2 . 3 Complex and Interdependent Tasks Beyond the atomic creative tasks are complex and interdependent tasks such as text - to - image generation [ 3 , 7 ] , and multifaceted tasks like storytelling in text [ 23 , 25 ] and images [ 24 ] . These tasks de - mand not only domain expertise but also capabilities for planning , reasoning , ideating , and maintaining context over extended peri - ods to create coherent and innovative content . Researchers have developed tools like Promptify [ 3 ] and PromptPaint [ 7 ] for text - to - image generation , Spellburst [ 1 ] for exploratory creative coding , and XCreation [ 24 ] for cross - modal storytelling to facilitate these intricate interactions . 3 PRELIMINARY STUDIES AND RESULTS Our research comprises three studies , each examining human - AI interactions across tasks varying in creativity and complexity . The initial study delves into fixed - scope content curation tasks , utiliz - ing news headline generation as the investigative lens . The first study examines fixed - scope content curation tasks , employing news headline generation as the medium for exploration . The second study transitions to probing atomic creative tasks , with a focus on analogy generation to uncover underlying creative processes . Lastly , the third study escalates in complexity , exploring the com - plex and interdependent tasks associated with data visualization . These three studies collectively offer a comprehensive understand - ing of human - AI interaction across a spectrum of task creativity and complexity . 3 . 1 Study 1 on Fixed - Scope Content Curation Tasks : News Headline Generation This research investigates human - AI interactions within fixed - scope content curation tasks , specifically focusing on the genera - tion of news headlines [ 12 ] . A between - subjects experiment was conducted involving 40 participants tasked with creating news headlines using either traditional manual methods or one of three LLM - enhanced systems : ( 1 ) selection , ( 2 ) guidance + selection , and ( 3 ) guidance + selection + post - editing : • Selection : The LLM generates three headlines for each news article ( generate headlines ) , and the user selects the most appropriate one ; • Guidance + Selection : The LLM extracts several poten - tial perspectives ( keywords ) from each news article ( extract perspectives ) , the user chooses one or more perspectives to emphasize in the headline , the LLM then generates three headlines for each news article based on the selected per - spectives ( generate headlines w / perspectives ) , and finally , the user selects the best one ; • Guidance + Selection + Post - editing : This is similar to Guidance + Selection , but the user can further edit the selected headline ( post - editing ) . An example of the interface supporting guidance + selection + post - editing is presented in Figure 2 . Subsequently , the outputs produced via the five interaction types—manual , AI - only , and the three AI - assisted conditions—were evaluated by a cohort of 20 experts . The results of the study indicate that LLMs ( GPT - 3 text - davinci - 002 model ) , on average , are capable of generating headlines of a high quality independently . However , they are not without flaws , necessitating human oversight to correct inaccuracies . The study found that the guidance + selection modality was particularly ef - fective , facilitating the efficient generation of superior headlines compared to more labor - intensive methods such as extensive post - editing or entirely manual composition . Interestingly , the research also observed that across all conditions , there was a similar level of perceived trust and control reported by participants . 3 . 2 Study 2 on Atomic Creative Tasks : Cross - Domain Analogy Generation Transitioning from fixed - scope content curation tasks , the second study delves into atomic creative tasks , focusing on cross - domain analogy generation . In this context , classical analogous problems curated or crafted by humans , such as Duncker and Lees’ radiation problem [ 15 ] , are employed to guide Large Language Models ( LLMs ) as examples in generating analogies ( see Figure 3 ) . Our study indi - cates the necessity for human evaluators to select , rate , and post - edit these AI - generated analogies to address potential biases and ensure ethical and legal compliance . In our recent exploratory experiments assessing LLMs’ efficacy in atomic creative tasks , we tasked participants with reformulating Charting Design Space of Human - AI Interactions through Task Creativity and Complexity IUI ’24 Companion , March 18 – 21 , 2024 , Greenville , South Carolina , United States Figure 2 : Study 1 on fixed - scope content curation tasks - in - terface for human - AI news headline co - creation for guid - ance + selection + post - editing condition : ( A ) news reading panel , ( B ) perspectives ( keywords ) selection panel ( multiple keywords can be selected ) , ( C ) headline selection panel with post - editing capability , and ( D ) difficulty rating slider . the original problem using 120 analogous problems generated by GPT - 3 text - davinci - 002 model [ 13 ] . The results were encouraging : the AI - generated analogies were predominantly perceived as useful , with a median helpfulness rating of 4 out of 5 , and they instigated substantial changes in problem formulation in about 80 % of cases . However , up to 25 % of the outputs were rated as potentially harmful , chiefly due to unsettling content that did not necessarily fall under bias or toxicity . These insights highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance atomic creative tasks and simultaneously draw attention to the necessity for human intervention in the form of selection , rating , and post - editing . Figure 3 : Study 2 on atomic creative tasks - our learning prompts based on Duncker and Lees’ radiation problem [ 15 ] for generating cross - domain analogies . 3 . 3 Study 3 on Complex and Interdependent Tasks : Data Visualization This study aims to explore human - AI interactions within the con - text of complex and interdependent tasks , with an emphasis on data visualization . Exploratory data analysis typically involves search - ing for insights that extend beyond linear and sequential thinking . While tools like Jupyter Notebook offer substantial analytical ca - pabilities , they often do not fully support the exploratory nature required for complex data analysis and corresponding human - AI interactions . To address these limitations , we introduced a " design - like " intelligent canvas . This tool integrates generative AI into the data analysis process and enhances human - AI collaboration by enabling interactive editing , which facilitates rapid prototyping , iteration , and the efficient management of comparative visualiza - tions ( refer to Figure 4 ) . A user study involving 10 participants with in - depth interview was conducted to evaluate the interface’s facilitation of human - AI interaction in tackling complex and inter - dependent tasks . 4 IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK Our impending research aims to explore further into the intricacies of human - AI interactions , particularly focusing on complex and interdependent tasks that exhibit a high potential for interaction . This study builds upon the insights gained from Study 3 , which pri - marily addressed the early stages of data visualization prototyping facilitated by generative AI . This process often resulted in a disor - ganized , " messy " canvas , as evidenced by the results of Study 3 . We now shift our focus to the subsequent phase : effectively presenting data analysis findings from these visualizations to the end - readers . To enhance the interpretability of the data visualization results , we will use Generative AI to transform the non - linear , dispersed results on the canvas into a linear , easy - to - read narrative consisting of text and visualizations . This transformation will be based on : 1 ) the visualizations and their associated information , including prompts used to generate those visualizations , descriptions ( cap - tions ) of insights from those visualizations , the order in which these visualizations were created , and their positions on the canvas ; 2 ) information about the readers , encompassing their interests , back - grounds , and prior knowledge . Similar to Study 1 , we will conduct a between - subjects study to test various human - AI interactions aimed at linearizing visualizations . These interactions include : • AI only : AI converts the canvas to a linear narrative using only the authoring information . • Selection : AI generates multiple narratives with authoring information , which the author of the visualizations then selects . • Post - Editing : AI generates one narrative with authoring information , which is then post - edited by the author of the visualizations . • Author Guidance : AI generates one narrative with both authoring information and keywords provided by the author of the visualizations . • End - Reader Guidance : AI generates one narrative with authoring information and incorporates the preferences , in - terests , and prior knowledge of the end - readers of the visu - alizations . • Author Only : The author of the visualizations crafts the narrative without AI assistance . Through this comprehensive evaluation , we aim to develop a more structured and intuitive method for presenting complex data analysis results from the exploration phase , making them accessible and understandable to a wider audience .
