Coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) , caused by SARS - CoV - 2 , follows a biphasic pattern of illness that likely results from the combination of an early viral response phase and an inflammatory second phase . Most clinical presentations are mild , and the typical pattern of covid - 19 more resembles an influenza - like illness—which includes fever , cough , malaise , myalgia , headache , and taste and smell disturbance—rather than severe pneumonia ( although emerging evidence about long term consequences is yet to be understood in detail ) . 1 In this review , we provide a broad update on the emerging understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 pathophysiology , including virology , transmission dynamics , and the immune response to the virus . Any of the mechanisms and assumptions discussed in the article and in our understanding of covid - 19 may be revised as further evidence emerges . What we know about the virus SARS - CoV - 2 is an enveloped β - coronavirus , with a genetic sequence very similar to SARS - CoV - 1 ( 80 % ) and bat coronavirus RaTG13 ( 96 . 2 % ) . 2 The viral envelopeiscoatedbyspike ( S ) glycoprotein , envelope ( E ) , and membrane ( M ) proteins ( fig 1 ) . Host cell binding and entry are mediated by the S protein . The first step in infection is virus binding to a host cell through its target receptor . The S1 sub - unit of the S protein contains the receptor binding domain that binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE 2 ) . In SARS - CoV - 2 the S2 sub - unit is highly preserved and is considered a potential antiviral target .

Stages ( 3 - 7 ) show the remaining steps of viral replication , leading to viral assembly , maturation , and virus release Coronaviruseshavethecapacityforproofreadingduringreplication , and therefore mutation rates are lower than in other RNA viruses . As SARS - CoV - 2 has spread globally it has , like other viruses , accumulated some mutations in the viral genome , which contains geographicsignatures . Researchershaveexaminedthesemutations to study virus characterisation and understand epidemiology and transmission patterns . In general , the mutations have not been attributed to phenotypic changes affecting viral transmissibility or pathogenicity . TheG614variantintheSproteinhasbeenpostulated to increase infectivity and transmissibility of the virus . 3 Higher viral loads were reported in clinical samples with virus containing G614 than previously circulating variant D614 , although no association was made with severity of illness as measured by hospitalisation outcomes . 3 These findings have yet to be confirmed with regards to natural infection . Why is SARS - CoV - 2 more infectious than SARS - CoV - 1 ? SARS - CoV - 2 has a higher reproductive number ( R0 ) than SARS - CoV - 1 , indicating much more efficient spread . 1 Several characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 may help explain this enhanced transmission . WhilebothSARS - CoV - 1andSARS - CoV - 2preferentially interactwiththeangiotensin - convertingenzyme2 ( ACE2 ) receptor , SARS - CoV - 2 has structural differences in its surface proteins that enablestrongerbindingtotheACE2receptor 4 andgreaterefficiency at invading host cells . 1 SARS - CoV - 2 also has greater affinity ( or bonding ) for the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva , 5 thus can infect the upper respiratory tract and conduct airways more easily . 6 Viral load dynamics and duration of infectiousness Viral load kinetics could also explain some of the differences betweenSARS - CoV - 2andSARS - CoV - 1 . Intherespiratorytract , peak SARS - CoV - 2 load is observed at the time of symptom onset or in the first week of illness with subsequent decline thereafter , which indicates the highest infectiousness potential just before or within the first five days of symptom onset ( fig 2 ) . 7 In contrast , in SARS - CoV - 1 the highest viral loads were detected in the upper respiratory tract in the second week of illness , which explains its minimal contagiousness in the first week after symptom onset , enabling early case detection in the community . 7 the bmj | BMJ 2020 ; 371 : m3862 | doi : 10 . 1136 / bmj . m3862 2 PRACTICE Fig 2 | After the initial exposure , patients typically develop symptoms within 5 - 6 days ( incubation period ) . SARS - CoV - 2 generates a diverse range of clinical manifestations , ranging from mild infection to severe disease accompanied by high mortality . In patients with mild infection , initial host immune response is capable of controlling the infection . Inseveredisease , excessiveimmuneresponseleadstoorgandamage , intensivecareadmission , ordeath . Theviralloadpeaksinthefirstweekofinfection , declines thereaftergradually , whiletheantibodyresponsegraduallyincreasesandisoftendetectablebyday14 ( figureadaptedwithpermissionfromdoi : 10 . 1016 / j . cell . 2020 . 04 . 013 ; doi : 10 . 1016 / S2213 - 2600 ( 20 ) 30230 - 7 ) Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) technologycandetectviralSARS - CoV - 2RNAintheupper respiratory tract for a mean of 17 days ( maximum 83 days ) after symptom onset . 7 However , detection of viral RNA by qRT - PCR does not necessarily equate to infectiousness , and viral culture from PCR positive upper respiratory tract samples has been rarely positive beyond nine days of illness . 5 This corresponds to what is known about transmission based on contact tracing studies , which is that transmission capacity is maximal in the first week of illness , and that transmission after this period has not been documented . 8 Severely ill or immune - compromised patients may have relatively prolongedvirusshedding , andsomepatientsmayhaveintermittent RNA shedding ; however , low level results close to the detection limit may not constitute infectious viral particles . While asymptomaticindividuals ( thosewithnosymptomsthroughoutthe infection ) can transmit the infection , their relative degree of infectiousness seems to be limited . 9 - 11 People with mild symptoms ( paucisymptomatic ) and those whose symptom have not yet appeared still carry large amounts of virus in the upper respiratory tract , which might contribute to the easy and rapid spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . 7 Symptomaticandpre - symptomatictransmission ( one to two days before symptom onset ) is likely to play a greater role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . 10 12 A combination of preventive measures , such as physical distancing and testing , tracing , and self - isolation , continue to be needed . Route of transmission and transmission dynamics Like other coronaviruses , the primary mechanism of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is via infected respiratory droplets , with viral infection occurring by direct or indirect contact with nasal , conjunctival , ororalmucosa . Targethostreceptorsarefoundmainly inthehumanrespiratorytractepithelium , includingtheoropharynx and upper airway . The conjunctiva and gastrointestinal tracts are alsosusceptibletoinfectionandmayserveastransmissionportals . 6 Transmission risk depends on factors such as contact pattern , environment , infectiousnessofthehost , andsocioeconomicfactors , as described elsewhere . 12 Most transmission occurs through close rangecontact ( 15minutesfacetofaceandwithin2m ) , 13 andspread is especially efficient within households and through gatherings of family and friends . 12 Household secondary attack rates ( the proportion of susceptible individuals who become infected within a group of susceptible contacts with a primary case ) ranges from 4 % to 35 % . 12 Sleeping in the same room as , or being a spouse of an infected individual increases the risk of infection , but isolation of the infected person away from the family is related to lower risk of infection . 12 Other activities identified as high risk include dining in close proximity with the infected person , sharing food , and taking partingroupactivities 12 Theriskofinfectionsubstantiallyincreases inenclosedenvironmentscomparedwithoutdoorsettings . 12 Aerosol transmission can still factor during prolonged stay in crowded , poorlyventilatedindoorsettings ( meaningtransmissioncouldoccur at a distance > 2 m ) . 12 14 - 16 The role of faecal shedding in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and the extent of fomite ( through inanimate surfaces ) transmission also remain to be fully understood . Both SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV - 1 remain viable for many days on smooth surfaces ( stainless steel , plastic , glass ) and at lower temperature and humidity ( eg , air 3 the bmj | BMJ 2020 ; 371 : m3862 | doi : 10 . 1136 / bmj . m3862 PRACTICE conditioned environments ) . 17 18 Thus , transferring infection from contaminated surfaces to the mucosa of eyes , nose , and mouth via unwashed hands is a possible route of transmission . This route of transmission may contribute especially in facilities with communal areas , with increased likelihood of environmental contamination . However , bothSARS - CoV - 1andSARS - CoV - 2arereadilyinactivated by commonly used disinfectants , emphasising the potential value of surface cleaning and handwashing . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA has been found in stool samples and RNA shedding often persists for longer than in respiratory samples 7 ; however , virus isolation has rarely been successful from the stool . 5 7 No published reports describe faecal - oral transmission . In SARS - CoV - 1 , faecal - oral transmission was not considered to occur in most circumstances ; but , one explosive outbreak was attributed to aerosolisation and spread of the virus across an apartment block via a faulty sewage system . 19 It remains to be seen if similar transmission may occur with SARS - CoV - 2 . Pathogenesis Viral entry and interaction with target cells SARS - CoV - 2 binds to ACE 2 , the host target cell receptor . 1 Active replication and release of the virus in the lung cells lead to non - specific symptoms such as fever , myalgia , headache , and respiratorysymptoms . 1 Inanexperimentalhamstermodel , thevirus causes transient damage to the cells in the olfactory epithelium , leadingtoolfactorydysfunction , whichmayexplaintemporaryloss of taste and smell commonly seen in covid - 19 . 20 The distribution of ACE2receptorsindifferenttissuesmayexplainthesitesofinfectionandpatientsymptoms . For example , the ACE 2 receptor is found on the epithelium of other organs such as the intestine and endothelialcellsinthekidneyandbloodvessels , whichmayexplain gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiovascular complications . 21 Lymphocytic endotheliitis has been observed in postmortem pathology examination of the lung , heart , kidney , and liver as well as liver cell necrosis and myocardial infarction in patients who died of covid - 19 . 122 These findings indicate that the virus directly affects many organs , as was seen in SARS - CoV - 1 and influenzae . Much remains unknown . Are the pathological changes in the respiratory tract or endothelial dysfunction the result of direct viral infection , cytokine dysregulation , coagulopathy , or are they multifactorial ? And does direct viral invasion or coagulopathy directly contribute to some of the ischaemic complications such as ischaemic infarcts ? These and more , will require further work to elucidate . Immune response and disease spectrum ( figure 2 ) After viral entry , the initial inflammatory response attracts virus - specific T cells to the site of infection , where the infected cells are eliminated before the virus spreads , leading to recovery in most people . 23 Inpatientswhodevelopseveredisease , SARS - CoV - 2elicits an aberrant host immune response . 23 24 For example , postmortem histology of lung tissues of patients who died of covid - 19 have confirmed the inflammatory nature of the injury , with features of bilateral diffuse alveolar damage , hyaline - membrane formation , interstitialmononuclearinflammatoryinfiltrates , anddesquamation consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , and is similartothelungpathologyseeninsevereMiddleEastrespiratorysyndrome ( MERS ) andsevereacuterespiratorysyndrome ( SARS ) . 2526 A distinctive feature of covid - 19 is the presence of mucus plugs with fibrinous exudate in the respiratory tract , which may explain the severityofcovid - 19eveninyoungadults . 27 Thisispotentiallycaused by the overproduction of pro - inflammatory cytokines that accumulate in the lungs , eventually damaging the lung parenchyma . 23 Some patients also experience septic shock and multi - organ dysfunction . 23 For example , the cardiovascular system is often involved early in covid - 19 disease and is reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides . 28 Consistent with the clinical context of coagulopathy , focal intra - alveolar haemorrhageandpresenceofplatelet - fibrinthrombiinsmallarterial vessels is also seen . 26 Cytokines normally mediate and regulate immunity , inflammation , and haematopoiesis ; however , further exacerbation of immune reaction and accumulation of cytokines inotherorgansinsomepatientsmaycauseextensivetissuedamage , or a cytokine release syndrome ( cytokine storm ) , resulting in capillary leak , thrombus formation , and organ dysfunction . 23 29 Mechanisms underlying the diverse clinical outcomes Clinical outcomes are influenced by host factors such as older age , male sex , and underlying medical conditions , 1 as well as factors related to the virus ( such as viral load kinetics ) , host - immune response , and potential cross - reactive immune memory from previous exposure to seasonal coronaviruses ( box 1 ) . Box 1 : Risk factors associated with the development of severe disease , admission to intensive care unit , and mortality Underlying condition • Older age • Hypertension • Cardiovascular disease • Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease • Diabetes • Obesity • Malignancy Presentation • Higher fever ( ≥39°C on admission ) • Dyspnoea on admission • Higher qSOFA score Laboratory markers • Neutrophilia / lymphopenia • Raised lactate and lactate dehydrogenase • Raised C reactive protein • Raised ferritin • Raised IL - 6 • Raised ACE2 • D - dimer > 1 μg / mL Sex - related differences in immune response have been reported , revealing that men had higher plasma innate immune cytokines andchemokinesatbaselinethanwomen . 30 Incontrast , womenhad notably more robust T cell activation than men , and among male participantsTcellactivationdeclinedwithage , whichwassustained among female patients . These findings suggest that adaptive immuneresponsemaybeimportantindefiningtheclinicaloutcomeasolderageandmalesexisassociatedwithincreasedriskofseverediseaseandmortality . Increasedlevelsofpro - inflammatorycytokinescorrelatewithsevere pneumonia and increased ground glass opacities within the lungs . 29 31 In people with severe illness , increased plasma the bmj | BMJ 2020 ; 371 : m3862 | doi : 10 . 1136 / bmj . m3862 4 PRACTICE concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers were observed compared with people with non - severe illness . 29 32 33 Emerging evidence suggests a correlation between viral dynamics , the severity of illness , and disease outcome . 7 Longitudinal characteristics of immune response show a correlation between the severity of illness , viral load , and IFN - α , IFN - γ , and TNF - α response . 33 In the same study many interferons , cytokines , and chemokines were elevated early in disease for patients who had severe disease and higher viral loads . This emphasises that viral load may drive these cytokines and the possible pathological roles associated with the host defence factors . This is in keeping with the pathogenesis of influenza , SARS , and MERS whereby prolonged viral shedding was also associated with severity of illness . 7 34 Given the substantial role of the immune response in determining clinical outcomes , several immunosuppressive therapies aimed at limiting immune - mediated damage are currently in various phases of development ( table 1 ) .

Few antibodies are detectable in the first four days of illness , but patients progressively develop them , with most achieving a detectable response after four weeks . 35 A wide range of virus - neutralising antibodies have been reported , and emerging evidence suggests that these may correlate with severity but wane over time . 36 The duration and protectivity of antibody and T cell responses remain to be defined through studies with longer follow - up . CD - 4 T cell responses to endemic human coronavirusesappeartomanifestcross - reactivitywithSARS - CoV - 2 , but their role in protection remains unclear . 37 Unanswered questions Further understanding of the pathogenesis for SARS - CoV - 2 will be vital in developing therapeutics , vaccines , and supportive care modalities in the treatment of covid - 19 . More data are needed to understand the determinants of healthy versus dysfunctional response and immune markers for protection and the severity of disease . Neutralising antibodies are potential correlates of protection , but other protective antibody mechanisms may exist . Similarly , the protective role of T cell immunity and duration of both antibody and T cell responses and the correlates of protection need to be defined . In addition , we need optimal testing systems andtechnologiestosupportandinformearlydetectionandclinicalmanagementofinfection . Greater understanding is needed regarding the long term consequences following acute illness and multisystem inflammatory disease , especially in children .
