ABSTRACT Title of dissertation : A BIOPHYSICAL STUDY OF CLATHRIN UTILIZING LIGHT SCATTERING , NEUTRON SCATTERING AND STRUCTURE BASED COMPUTER MODELING Matthew Lee Ferguson , Doctor of Philosophy , 2007 Dissertation directed by : Dr . Ralph Nossal National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Professor Wolfgang Losert Department of Physics A principal component in the protein coats of certain post - golgi and endocytic vesicles is clathrin , which appears as a three - legged heteropolymer ( known as a triske - lion ) that assembles into polyhedral baskets principally made up of pentagonal and hexagonal faces . In vitro , this assembly depends on the pH , with baskets forming more readily at low pH and less readily at high pH . We have developed procedures , based on static and dynamic light scattering , to determine the radius of gyration , R g , and hydrodynamic radius , R H , of isolated triskelia under conditions where basket assembly occurs . Calculations based on rigid molecular bead models of a triskelion show that the measured values can be accounted for by bending of the legs and a puckering at the vertex . We also show that the values of R g and R H measured for clathrin triskelia in solution are qualitatively consistent with the conformation of an individual triskelion that is part of a ”D6 barrel” basket assembly measured by cryo - EM tomography . We extended this study by performing small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) experiments on isolated triskelia in solution under conditions where baskets do not assemble . SANS experiments were consistent with previous static light scattering ex - periments but showed a shoulder in the scattering function at intermediate q - values just beyond the central diﬀraction peak ( the Guinier regime ) . Theoretical calcula - tions based on rigid bead models of a triskelion showed well - deﬁned features in this region diﬀerent from the experiment . A ﬂexible bead - spring model of a triskelion and Brownian dynamics simulations were used to generate a time averaged scattering function . This model adequately described the experimental data for ﬂexibilities close to previous estimates from the analysis of electron micrographs .

INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 Foreword Developing a better understanding of how cells operate requires advances in the understanding of how basic cellular functions such as mitosis ( cell division ) , exocytosis ( molecular secretion ) , and endocytosis ( molecular internalization ) are performed at the molecular level [ 1 ] . Each of these processes is driven by the collective function of many diﬀerent cellular components having the form of cytosolic proteins , membrane proteins , lipids and nucleic acids . In diﬀerent types of cells , many of these components have been identiﬁed . Their roles in cellular functions can be discerned in many ways . One common way is by “removing” a component from a cell to see how ( or whether ) a process is aﬀected . If a process is aﬀected , then the missing component may be involved in that process in some way . This can be done by producing a knockout mouse , making a mutation in the genome , or more recently by RNA interference ( RNAi ) . The static structure of some components may be determined by X - ray crystallography or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( NMR ) . The molecule must be crystallized for X - ray and 2 have a low mass ( < 40 kDa 1 ) for solution NMR 2 . Cryo - EM tomography can be used to reconstruct some larger macromolecular structures and assemblies . By identifying and visualizing the basic building blocks of some parts of the cellular machinery , we hope to get some idea of how each component performs its assigned function within the cell . Fig . 1 . 1 : “The major features of eucaryotic cells . The drawing depicts a typical animal cell , but almost all the same components are found in plants and fungi and in single - celled eucaryotes such as yeasts and protozoa . ” Figure and caption from Molecular Biology of the Cell [ 4 , Fig 1 - 31 , p . 29 ] 1 1 kDa = 10 3 Dalton = 10 3 atomic mass units = 1 / N A kilograms ( where N A is Avagadro’s Number ) 2 Recently much larger structures ( ∼ 900 kDa ) have been obtained using NMR but these structures require a high degree of symmetry . See Ref . [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . 3 In eucaryotic 3 cells , membranes composed of lipid bilayers and integral mem - brane proteins make up the outer plasma membrane and subdivide the cell into diﬀerent compartments or organelles . ( See Fig . 1 . 1 . ) The endocytic pathway allows cells to ingest macromolecules from outside of the cell . The secretory pathway allows eucaryotic cells to regulate the delivery of molecules ( such as newly synthesized pro - teins ) from the cell interior to the cell exterior . These processes are collectively called intracellular “traﬃcking” . The clathrin machinery ( which is the system under study ) is involved in both the endocytic and secretory pathways . The protein , clathrin , is a heteropolymer composed of a 192 kDa heavy chain and a variable , ca . 23 - 27 kDa , associated light chain [ 5 ] . It occurs in nearly all eucaryotic cells . It is a component of the machinery that the cell uses to move speciﬁc molecules across lipid bilayer membranes , in the process generating a clathrin coated vesicle which is composed of a molecular lattice surrounding an inner membrane shell . Cells also use clathrin independent pathways for traﬃcking , including the use of the proteins called coat protein complex I and II ( COPI and COPII ) in the secretory pathway , and the protein caveolin in the endocytic pathway [ 1 , ch . 14 p . 472 ] . These other types of intracellular traﬃcking are known to have speciﬁc roles within the cell , 3 Eucaryotic cells are a large class of cells whose deﬁning characteristics are that genetic informa - tion is contained in a nucleus , and the cells are divided up internally into diﬀerent compartments by lipid bilayer membranes . Animal kingdoms belonging to the domain Eucaryota include Animalia , Fungi , Plantae , and Protista . Prokaryotic cells are evolutionarily older and are not divided up in this way . Prokaryota includes the domains of Bacteria and Archaea . In prokayotes genetic information is spread throughout the cell . 4 as does clathrin . It is not currently understood why the cell requires more than one pathway for traﬃcking or why they are diﬀerent [ 6 ] . Fig . 1 . 2 shows the utilization of these coat proteins in diﬀerent aspects of the intracellular traﬃcking pathway . Fig . 1 . 2 : “Utilization of diﬀerent protein coats in intracellular traﬃcking . Diﬀerent coat proteins select diﬀerent cargo and shape the transport vesicles that mediate the various steps in the secretory and endocytic pathways . Many diﬀerentiated cells have additional pathways beside those shown in this ﬁgure , including for example , a specialized recycling pathway for proteins of synaptic vesicles in the synapses of neurons . ” Figure and Caption from Molecular Biology of the Cell [ 4 , Fig 13 - 5 p . 716 ] All of the proteins listed above , clathrin , COPI , COPII and caveolin operate by coating small ( ∼ 60nm ) vesicles that carry cargo through the cell . Some speciﬁc and important examples of clathrin function are LDL intake , insulin degradation and 5 Fig . 1 . 3 : “Fate of an LDL particle and its receptor after en - docytosis . After an LDL particle binds to an LDL receptor on the plasma membrane , the receptor - ligand complex is internalized in a clathrin - coated pit that pinches oﬀ to become a coated vesicle . The clathrin coat then depolymerizes to triskelia , resulting in an early endosome . This endosome fuses with a sorting vesicle , known as a late en - dosome , where the low pH ( 5 ) causes the LDL particles to dissociate from the LDL receptors . A receptor - rich region buds oﬀ to form a sepa - rate vesicle that recycles the LDL receptors back to the plasma membrane . A vesicle containing an LDL particle may fuse with another late en - dosome but ultimately fuses with a lysosome to form a larger lysosome . There , the apo - B protein of the LDL particle is degraded to amino acids and the cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to fatty acids and cholesterol . Abundant imported choles - terol inhibits synthesis by the cell of both choles - terol and LDL receptor protein . The same path - way is followed by other ligands , such as insulin and other protein hormones , that are internalized by receptor - mediated endocytosis and degraded in the lysosome . ” Figure and Caption from Molecu - lar Cell Biology [ 7 ] 6 synaptic vesicle formation in neurons 4 . More generally , clathrin - coated vesicles are involved in the traﬃcking of proteins between speciﬁc organelles within the cell and the recycling / recovery of constituents of the outer cell membrane . A schematic of coated vesicle formation is shown in Fig . 1 . 3 . Three clathrin molecules join at a common hub to form a three - legged “triske - lion” , which is the basic building block of the lattice . Each leg is approximately 30 ˚A thick [ 8 ] and 520 ˚A [ 9 , 10 ] in length , and ends in a globular ”terminal domain” of radius 50 ˚A [ 11 , 8 ] . By convention , a leg is divided into a proximal segment adjoining the central hub , a distal segment , and a linker region that connects with the terminal domain . A clathrin heavy chain runs the entire length of the leg , with a light chain attached near the common hub ( see Fig . 2 . 1 ) . In vitro , the triskelia assemble into polyhedral “baskets” composed of pentag - onal and hexagonal faces , mimicking the structures seen on the outside of endocytic vesicles and the inner plasma membrane of a cell [ 13 ] ( shown in Fig . 1 . 4 ) . One can dissociate baskets or uncoat vesicles by changing the properties of the solution in which they are suspended ( e . g . , by changing pH and ionic strength ) [ 14 ] or by adding an uncoating protein ( called Hsp70 ATPase [ 15 ] ) . The structure assumed by a triskelion in a basket has been measured by cryo - EM tomography [ 16 ] . ( This structure is shown in Fig . 2 . 3 . ) The solution structure of an isolated triskelion cannot easily be imaged directly , but must be inferred from 4 Synaptic vesicles carry neurotransmitter for rapid release into a synaptic junction by a ﬁring neuron . 7 Fig . 1 . 4 : Electron micrograph of inner plasma membrane of a cell . A deep etch electron micrograph of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of a cell undergoing en - docytosis . Clathrin coated pits and vesicles are clearly visible . [ 12 , from J . Heuser ] 8 indirect , although noninvasive , measurements . Those measurements and the analysis done to interpret them are the subject of this thesis . Static light scattering ( SLS ) provides a measure of particle size and dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) provides a measure of particle mobility ( or diﬀusion ) . The ﬁrst aim of our study was to use these two techniques to determine information about triskelion structure in solution . These measurements could then be compared with expected values based on the structure of a triskelion within an assembled clathrin basket , which has been determined by high resolution cryo - EM tomography [ 16 ] . This was done to determine whether the puckered shape of the triskelion in the lattice preexists before the assembly of the clathrin lattice , or whether assembly into the lattice produces this triskelial shape . The second aim of our study involves understanding of the ﬂexibility of the triskelion leg . This is of crucial importance to measurement of the solution structure of the triskelion , the ﬁrst aim . If the triskelion leg is inﬂexible , then each individual triskelion must necessarily have a predetermined shape allowing it to self assemble into a basket under appropriate conditions . If the triskelion leg is very ﬂexible then a unique triskelial structure does not exist before the assembly into the basket . In this case the puckered structure for a clathrin triskelion would exist only because of geometry imposed by the lattice of a clathrin basket . The experimental technique that is used to investigate triskelial ﬂexibility is small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) . SANS was used in this study in order to extend static light scattering measure - ments using a probe of smaller length scales ( neutrons used had a wavelength of 5 . 5 ˚A vs . a wavelength of 5145˚A for our SLS ) . It was not known a priori what we 9 would ﬁnd by SANS , but it was assumed that these measurements would support or contradict our rigid bead models of clathrin which were used to ﬁt light scattering data of the previous study . 1 . 2 Outline of Thesis Chapter 2 includes background information on the biological molecule un - der study as well as a review of the basic physics underlying the experimental and computational techniques that were used to interpret the results of my experiments . Chapter 3 describes light scattering experiments that were performed on iso - lated clathrin triskelia in solution along with analysis that was done to interpret the results . Both Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) and Static Light Scattering ( SLS ) techniques were used to measure scattered laser light from puriﬁed protein in solu - tion . One of the questions asked was : Does the clathrin triskelion have the same shape when it is isolated in solution as it has when assembled into a clathrin basket as measured by cryo - EM tomography ? ( The cryo - EM structure of a clathrin basket as measured by Fotin et al . [ 16 ] is shown in Fig . 2 . 3 . ) The results of my experiments were compared to diﬀerent models of clathrin that were based on previous structural studies . Chapter 4 describes small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) experiments that were performed on isolated clathrin triskelia in solution , as well as analysis using rigid models . Small angle neutron scattering experiments measured neutrons scattered from puriﬁed clathrin triskelia in solution . One of the questions asked was : Can we 10 gain additional information about clathrin’s structure in solution by doing SANS that is not available through SLS and DLS ? The results of the experiments were compared to calculations using the Debye equation and diﬀerent models of clathrin based on previous structural studies ( including those of Chapter 3 ) . Chapter 5 describes Brownian dynamics simulations which take into account the ﬂexibility of a clathrin triskelion molecule . The simulation is used to calculate a time - averaged scattering function . The calculated scattering function is then com - pared with SANS data from experiments described in Chapter 4 . We ﬁnd that this analysis provides an estimate of the persistence length of the clathrin legs . Chapter 6 summarizes our study and discusses future experiments . 2 . BACKGROUND 2 . 1 Clathrin Structure and Function Clathrin is an intriguing candidate for detailed molecular investigation . The striking electron micrographs taken by John Heuser and Jim Harrison in 1983 [ 12 , 17 ] ( similar to that seen in Fig . 1 . 4 ) showed the polygonal coat of the inner membrane of a cell where clathrin mediated endocytosis occurs . When clathrin triskelia were isolated from coated vesicles , electron micrographs showed the three armed pinwheel like structure of the triskelion shown in Fig . 2 . 1a . Images and structures of the components of this complex macromolecule have improved , but a simple understanding of how it works is elusive . For example , it is not known whether clathrin causes the membrane to bend as was originally thought , or whether it recruits proteins to the region that cause the membrane to bend as some new evidence has shown [ 18 , 19 ] . If the legs of a triskelion were to be characterized as a polymer , a good descrip - tion might be that they were semi - ﬂexible , i . e . bending on length scales compara - ble to the length of a single leg . They have both deﬁnite structural attributes and ﬂexibility [ 9 , 10 ] . This may or may not be a necessary property for the function they 12 Fig . 2 . 1 : a ) “An electron micrograph showing a clathrin triskelion . ” [ 5 , Fig . 4a ] b ) “A diagram of the lattice structure of a clathrin triskelion , measured by cryo - EM tomography of a D6 basket assembled from Clathrin and AP2 . ” Figure and Caption from Kirchhausen et al . [ 5 , Fig . 4b ] perform , but the ﬂexible nature of triskelia requires special approaches in order to study their structure . 2 . 1 . 1 Clathrin is an Unstable Protein A common way to produce a protein , if its amino acid sequence is known , is to express it in bacteria or yeast 1 cells . Clathrin cannot be produced in this fash - ion because it will not fold properly without the presence of eucaryotic chaperone proteins [ 20 ] . Also , for unknown reasons , puriﬁed clathrin triskelia “degrades” after approximately two weeks . Storage at low temperature ( − 80 ◦ C ) does not change this process of degradation [ 21 ] . Therefore , fresh protein must be acquired and puriﬁed 1 These are two cell types that are easily produced and are viable and reproductive after this kind of genetic modiﬁcation . 13 from bovine brain matter on a regular basis . Experiments generally must be com - pleted within two weeks of puriﬁcation , or the protein will lose its ability to function . 2 . 1 . 2 Previous Structural Measurements of Clathrin Triskelia The subunits of supramolecular clathrin structures are descriptively called triske - lia , since each clathrin triskelion is made up of three legs . Early images of clathrin triskelia came from rotary shadowed electron micrographs of triskelia adsorbed onto cleaved mica surfaces . [ 17 ] ( See Fig . 2 . 1a ) Each “leg” of a clathrin triskelion is made up of two polypeptide chains . The largest polypeptide chain , called the clathrin heavy chain or CHC , is 1675 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 192 KDa . [ 5 , p . 707 ] The C - terminus of the CHC is a trimerization domain , where the three legs join . A large part of the CHC has a coiled coil zig - zag structure of α - helices [ 22 ] , somewhat reminiscent of a spring . The N - terminus is a seven blade β - propeller [ 11 ] . This is a binding domain for associated proteins also involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Pieces of both of these parts of the CHC have been crystallized and the structures determined at high resolution by X - ray diﬀraction ( see Fig . 2 . 2 ) . Attached to the CHC near the trimerization domain is the clathrin light chain ( or CLC ) . This polypeptide has two forms , A and B . CLC A contains 243 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 26 . 7 KDa . CLC B has 210 amino acids and a molecular weight of 23 . 0 KDa 2 . These diﬀerent types of CLC can attach onto a single 2 Molecular weights were calculated from the known protein sequences by the online tool and data - base : Expasy ProtParamTool .

They share about 60 % sequence identity and are thought to regulate triskelion basket assembly and aﬀect CHC trimerization [ 23 ] . CLC A and CLC B are both believed to be unstructured when not attached to the CHC . The entire clathrin triskelion is a hetero hexamer of CHC , CLC A and CLC B . It average molecular weight is ∼ 650 KDa . Each arm stretches out from its vertex in what has been described as a “spider” or “pinwheel” like structure . The average length of the arm is estimated to be ∼ 520 ˚A long . The average width is ∼ 30 ˚A [ 9 ] . used were : CHC : NP 776448 CLC A : NP 776447 CLC B : NP 776702 from Bos Taurus 16 2 . 1 . 3 Clathrin Coated Vesicles and Clathrin Baskets Vesicles isolated from diﬀerent types of cells have characteristic sizes and asso - ciated clathrin coats that can be related to speciﬁc polyhedra , made up of pentagonal and hexagonal faces [ 13 ] . All polyhedral structures have a single triskelion at each vertex . When isolated in solution , under special conditions clathrin triskelia will self - assemble to form empty , closed polyhedral structures called “cages” or “baskets” . These have a morphology similar to that of the clathrin lattice surrounding coated vesicles . The structures observed include tetrahedral and cubic [ 24 ] as well as dodec - ahedral and icosahedral polyhedra . In the presence of an adaptor protein , AP2 , a structure called a D6 basket has been observed to occur . Recently , this assembly has been studied by cryo - EM tomography at a resolution great enough to distinguish indi - vidual clathrin triskelia within the structure [ 16 ] . ( This structure is shown in Fig . 2 . 3 ) This measurement suggests that , in a lattice , triskelia do not assume a conformation that is ﬂat and planar like the structure shown in electron micrographs , but rather the structure has an extreme umbrella - like curvature exceeding the curvature of the basket structure it forms . The shape of an individual triskelion when incorporated into such a lattice structure is shown in Fig . 2 . 1b [ 16 ] and is highlighted in red in Fig . 2 . 3 . 17 2 . 2 Scattering from Dilute Macromolecules in Solution In the following section , I will derive basic equations that will be used in later chapters to extract information from experimental measurements from clathrin in solution . The objective of this section is to review the basic equations governing the scattering of light and neutrons from macromolecules in solution . Interpretations of experimental results that will be presented later will be dependent on this theory . 2 . 2 . 1 Outline of Section The ﬁrst result derived , the Debye equation , describes the diﬀraction pattern of waves scattered from a molecule in solution , when the target is large compared to the wavelength of the incident radiation . In this derivation , the molecule is approximated by an arrangement of identical point scatterers . The resulting diﬀraction pattern is due to constructive and destructive interference of waves scattered from diﬀerent points within the molecule . The second result , the Guinier Approximation , is derived from the Debye equation and is a simpliﬁcation of the equation in the small - angle limit or the limit of large but ﬁnite wavelength . The third result applies to a molecule undergoing diﬀusion and relates the motion of the molecule to ﬂuctuations in the scattered light intensity and the temporal intensity autocorrelation function . 2 . 2 . 2 Origin of Scattered Intensity of Light from Macromolecules in Solution Incident light sets up a vibration between the positively charged and negatively charged elements of a molecule or dielectric particle , creating an oscillating dipole . 18 Such a dipole is itself a source of electromagnetic radiation . The secondary radiation has the same frequency as the incident radiation but is 180 ◦ degrees out of phase with it ( note the minus sign in Eq . 2 . 1 ) . So the electric dipole moment , (cid:126)p , induced at a position (cid:126)r 0 by a traveling electromagnetic wave , (cid:126)E 0 , incident on a point particle of polarizability α would be given by (cid:126)p = − 4 π(cid:178) 0 α (cid:126)E 0 e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 ( 2 . 1 ) where the polarizability , α , has units of volume and (cid:178) 0 is the electric permittivity of free space . The electric ﬁeld of the dipole radiation , (cid:126)E S , radiating along a direction ˆ n from such a dipole is given at a position (cid:126)r ( far from the particle so (cid:126)r (cid:192) (cid:126)r 0 ) by [ 25 ] (cid:126)E S = k 20 4 π(cid:178) 0 e ik 0 ˆ n · ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r 0 ) | (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r 0 | ( ˆ n × (cid:126)p ) × ˆ n using the approximation that k 0 ˆ n · ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r 0 ) ≈ k 0 r − k 0 ˆ n · (cid:126)r 0 , Eq . 2 . 1 , and by deﬁning the scattered wave vector as (cid:126)k S = k 0 ˆ n and the scattering vector as (cid:126)q = (cid:126)k 0 − (cid:126)k S = (cid:126)k 0 − k 0 ˆ n . This expression can be approximated as (cid:126)E S ≈ − k 20 αe i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 e ik 0 r r e ik 0 ˆ n · (cid:126)r 0 ( ˆ n × (cid:126)E 0 ) × ˆ n ≈ − k 20 αe ik 0 r r e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r 0 ( ˆ n × (cid:126)E 0 ) × ˆ n . ( 2 . 2 ) Moreover , | ( ˆ n × (cid:126)E 0 ) × ˆ n | becomes | (cid:126)E 0 | sin ( θ 1 ) , where θ 1 is the angle between the incident wave’s polarization ( also the direction of the induced electric dipole ) and the scattering plane . The scattering plane is deﬁned by the incident wave vector , (cid:126)k 0 , and outgoing wave vector , (cid:126)k S = k 0 ˆ n . Since in our light scattering experiments the incident laser light is vertically polarized , θ 1 = 90 ◦ . This assumes that the molecule under 19 study is an isotropic scatterer ( the polarization , (cid:126)p , is aligned with and proportional to incident electric ﬁeld , (cid:126)E 0 as in Eq . 2 . 1 ) . The scattered intensity is thus given by I S = | (cid:126)E ∗ S · (cid:126)E S | = α 2 k 40 sin 2 ( θ 1 ) r 2 I 0 . ( 2 . 3 ) Eq . 2 . 3 was ﬁrst derived by Lord Rayleigh in 1871 and describes light scattered from a simple point dipole or scattering from a molecule whose dimension is small compared to the wavelength of the incident radiation . Since we do not scatter from particles in a vacuum but from particles in a solvent , we are interested in the diﬀerence in polarizability of the particle with the surrounding solvent . The polarizability relative to the medium , α , can be related to the index of refraction by the equation 4 πρ α = n 2 − n 20 where n is the index of refraction of the particle , n 0 is the index of refraction of the surrounding medium and ρ is the number of scattering particles per unit volume [ 26 ] . 2 . 2 . 3 Origin of Scattering of Neutrons from Macromolecules in Solution Neutrons interact in a diﬀerent manner than electromagnetic radiation . Instead of inducing an electromagnetic dipole , neutrons interact with the spins of an atomic nucleus through the short ranged strong nuclear force . Since the range of this force is so short relative to the wavelength of neutrons we are working with ( 10 − 15 m vs . 10 − 10 m ) the neutron - nucleus interaction can be approximated by a delta function ( Fermi’s pseudo - potential ) which , for a single nucleus j centered at position (cid:126)r j with scattering length b j , is given by V j ( (cid:126)r ) = (cid:195) 2 π ¯ h 2 m (cid:33) b j δ 3 ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r j ) , 20 where δ 3 ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r j ) is a Dirac delta function centered at (cid:126)r j . Thus , for a collection of N nucleons , the scattering potential would be V ( (cid:126)r ) = N (cid:88) j = 1 V j ( (cid:126)r ) = (cid:195) 2 π ¯ h 2 m (cid:33) N (cid:88) j = 1 b j δ 3 ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r j ) . The scattering length , b j , must be measured for each element and can be found on the National Center for Neutron Research webpage 3 for “thermal” neutrons ( having energies close to room temperature , corresponding to a wavelength greater than 1˚A ) . It was shown by Fermi that this pseudo - potential causes the same scattering as the actual interaction but is weak enough to be used in the perturbation expansion of Born ( the Born Approximation ) [ 27 , 28 ] . Far from a scatterer positioned at the origin , a scattered plane wave can be written in the form Ψ S ( (cid:126)r , t ) = f ( Ω ) e ik 0 r r . ( 2 . 4 ) For a weak potential V ( (cid:126)r ) in the Born approximation , the scattering wave amplitude , f ( Ω ) , is given by [ 29 ] f ( Ω ) = − m 2 π ¯ h 2 (cid:90) e i ( (cid:126)k 0 − (cid:126)k S ) · (cid:126)r V ( (cid:126)r ) d(cid:126)r = − m 2 π ¯ h 2 (cid:90) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r V ( (cid:126)r ) d(cid:126)r = − N (cid:88) j = 1 b j e − i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r j . ( 2 . 5 ) For a single point dipole in light scattering f ( Ω ) = αk 20 | (cid:126)E 0 | sin ( θ 1 ) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r 0 ( 2 . 6 ) 3 http : / / www . ncnr . nist . gov / resources / sldcalc . html 21 so , for many dipoles , a light scattering expression appears , in analogy to Eq . 2 . 5 , as f ( Ω ) = N (cid:88) j = 1 αk 20 | (cid:126)E 0 | sin ( θ 1 ) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r j . ( 2 . 7 ) The probability of an incident plane wave of wave vector (cid:126)k 0 being scattered by a weak potential V ( (cid:126)r ) to become an outgoing plane wave with outgoing wavevector (cid:126)k S is given by d 2 σ d Ω = | f ( Ω ) | 2 = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 b i b j e i(cid:126)q · ( (cid:126)r i − (cid:126)r j ) = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 b i b j e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij . ( 2 . 8 ) Since V ( r ) is a real valued potential , b ∗ j = b j . Neutrons have a very strong interaction with the protons in hydrogen atoms . If water is used as a solvent , it produces a large background of scattered neutrons and must be considered . There are two types of eﬀects that must be considered in the scattering of neutrons from particles in a solution . They are called coherent and incoherent scattering . Coherent scattering arises from interference eﬀects of a single neutron scattered from all of the nuclei in a given molecule and is very dependent on the scattering vector (cid:126)q ( or scattering angle θ ) . Incoherent scattering can be thought of as the collective scattering of many neutrons from a single nucleus and is independent of the scattering angle θ . Incoherent scattering arises from ﬂuctuations of scattering lengths within a given nucleus . Even for a scatterer made up of a single isotope , not all of the scattering lengths 22 in Eq . 2 . 8 will be equal . This is because the scattering length of a nucleus depends on its spin state , and most isotopes have several spin states [ 28 ] . If we write the scattering length , b j , as the sum of an average scattering length , ¯ b , and a ﬂuctuation scattering length , δb j = b j − ¯ b , such that < b j > = ¯ b and < δb j > = 0 , then we can separate Eq . 2 . 8 into two parts . ( Here the angular brackets , < . > , denote a time or ensemble average over all isotopic spin states . ) We ﬁnd d 2 σ d Ω = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 ( ¯ b + δb i ) ( ¯ b + δb j ) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij = ¯ b 2 N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij + ¯ b N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:189)(cid:189)(cid:62) 0 δb i e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij + ¯ b N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:189)(cid:189)(cid:62) 0 δb j e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij + N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 δb i δb j e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij = ¯ b 2 N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij + N (cid:88) i = 1 δb 2 i + N (cid:88) i = 2 j < i (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:169)(cid:169)(cid:169)(cid:169)(cid:42) 0 δb i δb j e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij + N (cid:88) i = 2 j < i (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:169)(cid:169)(cid:169)(cid:169)(cid:42) 0 δb i δb j e − i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij = ¯ b 2 N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij + N (cid:88) i = 1 δb 2 i ( 2 . 9 ) The ﬁrst term in Eq . 2 . 9 is called coherent scattering and the second term is incoherent scattering . The middle two terms on the second line average to zero because < δb j > = 0 . The last two terms of the third line average to zero because scattering length ﬂuctuations ( or isotopic spin states ) of diﬀerent atomic nuclei within a molecule are uncorrelated . In light scattering the polarizability , α , within a single molecule would take the place of the scattering length , b j . Then , the second term in Eq . 2 . 9 would average to zero since the polarizability within a molecule is much more uniform ( as seen by photons ) than the neutron scattering length ( as seen by neutrons ) . The reason for this is that , while a single nucleus may have diﬀerent spin states , all atoms and 23 Tab . 2 . 1 : Table of Neutron Scattering Length Density , Incoherent Scat - tering Cross Section and Index of Refraction Material ρ = ¯ bV 4 π ( ¯ b 2 − ¯ b 2 ) V n × 10 10 [ cm − 2 ] a [ cm − 1 ] b dimensionless H 2 O - 0 . 56 5 . 62 1 . 333 c D 2 O 6 . 3 0 . 14 1 . 329 c Typical Protein 3 . 1 – 1 . 58 d Deuterated Protein 8 . 5 – – a From Cantor and Schimmel [ 30 ] and Glatter and Kratky [ 31 ] b Calculated from NCNR webpage : http : / / www . ncnr . nist . gov / resources / sldcalc . html c Measured d From Hand et al . [ 32 ] molecules of a homogeneous material have similar charge distributions and therefore have similar polarizabilities . In SANS , one utilizes a bulk scattering length density , ρ , which for a given material , can be calculated by adding up the scattering lengths of the constituent nucleons and dividing by the volume of the particle , ρ = (cid:80) j b j / V . Since our neutron scattering experiments are also in solution , we are interested only in the diﬀerence in scattering between the particle and solvent . The coherent scattered intensity is proportional to the square of the relative scattering length density , ( ∆ ρ ) 2 = ( ρ p − ρ s ) 2 where ρ p is the average scattering length density of the particle and ρ s is the average scattering length density of the solvent . At low concentrations of particles , the incoherent scattered intensity is depen - dent mostly upon the scattering length density of the solvent . It is proportional to 24 Fig . 2 . 4 : “Diagram illustrating origin of phase diﬀerence in scattered waves .

Scattering length densities and in - dices of refraction for a few substances are shown in Table 2 . 1 . This will be discussed more in Chapter 4 . 25 2 . 2 . 4 Interference Between Waves Scattered from Diﬀerent Positions Within a Particle Produce a Diﬀraction Pattern The interactions between light and neutrons with matter are very diﬀerent , but in both cases diﬀraction eﬀects arise from interference between scattered coherent waves emanating from diﬀerent points within the scattering volume . The theory for light scattering is very similar to that of neutrons with the exception of a few small changes . Consider the waves originating from two scattering centers separated by position vector (cid:126)r . A ray diagram of this is illustrated in Fig . 2 . 4 . While the scattering amplitude is dependent on the type and strength of the interaction of the incident wave with the scatterer , the phase diﬀerence between coherent waves scattered from diﬀerent positions in a scattering volume originates from the diﬀerence in path lengths traveled by each wave . This phase diﬀerence between the scattered waves can be expressed as ∆ φ = k 0 AP 2 − k S P 1 B = (cid:179) (cid:126)k 0 − (cid:126)k S (cid:180) · (cid:126)r = (cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ( 2 . 10 ) where (cid:126)k 0 is the incident wave vector and (cid:126)k S is the scattered wave vector . Here we have deﬁned the scattering vector (cid:126)q as (cid:126)k 0 − (cid:126)k S . If the scattered wave is of the same wavelength as the incident wave , then the magnitude of the scattering vector , q = | (cid:126)q | , can be written as 2 k 0 sin θ 2 where θ is the angle between the incident wave vector , (cid:126)k 0 , and the outgoing wave vector , (cid:126)k S . If the incident wave is coherent and the scattered waves are of similar amplitude , constructive interference will occur when ∆ φ is an 26 even multiple of π . Destructive interference will occur when ∆ φ is an odd multiple of π . 2 . 2 . 5 The Debye Equation The scattering of radiation from a collection of scatterers of even very simple geometric shape is diﬃcult to evaluate exactly . However , in the case where a very small fraction of the incident wave is scattered , one can use the ﬁrst Born approxi - mation to calculate the amplitude of the scattered wave with respect to the incident wave , as was done for both neutrons and photons in the previous section . In this approximation all scatterers see the same incident wave ( in amplitude ) and the relative phase diﬀerence between the scattered waves is dependent only on the path lengths as described above . This case was ﬁrst studied by Debye [ 33 ] , and was evalu - ated for a few simple geometric shapes such as spheres and random coils [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] . Many other simple geometric shapes and models such as rods , freely jointed chains , semi - ﬂexible chains , and ﬂexible star polymers have been investigated by others to study synthetic polymers in solution [ 31 ] . The general case for a collection of spheres , the Debye equation , will be derived in the following sections . 2 . 2 . 6 Scattering from Two Scatterers Consider a monochromatic traveling plane wave as described by the expression Ψ e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r − iωt . If the wave is incident on two identical scatterers separated by a position vector , (cid:126)r , ( as shown in Fig . 2 . 4 ) , the resulting scattered wave can be described by the sum of the waves scattered from each scatterer . ( For simplicity , the scattered ampli - 27 tude will be assumed to be identical for each scatterer . ) The scattering amplitude for a single scatterer will hereafter be denoted by Ψ 0 . 4 Ψ S = Ψ 0 e − iωt + i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r + Ψ 0 e − iωt + i(cid:126)k S · (cid:126)r = Ψ 0 e − iωt + i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r ( 1 + e i ( (cid:126)k S − (cid:126)k 0 ) · (cid:126)r ) = Ψ 0 e − iωt + i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r ( 1 + e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ) ( 2 . 11 ) The reduced probability density ( or equivalently the reduced diﬀerential scat - tering cross section ) along a direction deﬁned by (cid:126)q , will be given by the norm squared of the scattered wave function , viz . , ˜ P ( (cid:126)q ) = Ψ S ( (cid:126)q , t ) · Ψ ∗ S ( (cid:126)q , t ) | Ψ 0 | 2 = ( 1 + e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ) · ( 1 + e − i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ) = ( 2 + 2 cos ( (cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ) ) = 4 cos (cid:195) (cid:126)q · (cid:126)r 2 (cid:33) 2 ( 2 . 12 ) 2 . 2 . 7 Scattering from N Scatterers The reduced scattering amplitude of a wave scattered by a molecule made up of N identical scatterers located at positions { (cid:126)r i } can be expressed as a sum over scatterers , i , as ˜ f ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , { (cid:126)r i } ) = 1 Ψ 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 Ψ i = e iφ 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 e i ∆ φ i 0 4 According to the previous section Ψ 0 = − k 20 α | E 0 | sin ( θ 1 ) e ik 0 R R or − b e ik 0 R R . Where (cid:126)R is the position of the detector with respect to the scatterer . 28 = e i (cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i 0 ( 2 . 13 ) where (cid:126)r i 0 is the position vector of the i th scattering center within the molecule , relative to some arbitrary origin within the molecule speciﬁed by (cid:126)r 0 ( say at the center of mass ) . The reduced probability density is the norm squared of the scattering amplitude . It is given by the double sum ˜ P ( (cid:126)q ) = | ˜ f ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , { (cid:126)r i } ) | 2 = f ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , { (cid:126)r i } ) · f ∗ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , { r i } ) = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 ( e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i ) ( e − i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r j ) = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij ( 2 . 14 ) where (cid:126)r ij = (cid:126)r i − (cid:126)r j is deﬁned as the relative distance between scatterers i and j . If we deﬁne the particle distribution function ρ ( (cid:126)r ) = 1 V (cid:80) Ni = 1 δ 3 ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r i ) then we can rewrite the sum in Eq . 2 . 13 in an integral form : f ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , { (cid:126)r i } ) = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i 0 = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 (cid:90) V d 3 r ρ ( (cid:126)r ) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ( 2 . 15 ) 2 . 2 . 8 Solution Scattering : Averaging over Diﬀerent Orientations The molecules we are studying are suspended in solution rather than being lo - cated in solid crystals with a ﬁxed orientation . They are randomly oriented . We can perform an angular average over all possible orientations of the molecule , thus remov - ing any dependence of the scattered probability density ˜ P on a speciﬁc direction of (cid:126)q with respect to the frame of reference of the molecule . This reduces our equation for 29 ˜ P ( (cid:126)q ) to a simpliﬁed form with a dependence only on the magnitude of the scattering wave vector , q , ( the angle between the incoming beam and the detector is implicit in this magnitude ) and the relative distances between all scatterers within the molecule : ˜ P ( q ) = < ˜ P ( (cid:126)q ) > Ω = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 (cid:90) 1 4 π d Ω e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 sin ( qr ij ) qr ij . ( 2 . 16 ) 2 . 2 . 9 Scattering from a Sphere For scatterers distributed uniformly in a sphere of ﬁnite radius a with constant density 1 V , we can integrate Eq . 2 . 15 , vis . f ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , (cid:126)r 0 ) = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 1 V (cid:90) a 0 r 2 dr (cid:90) d Ω e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r = 3 ( sin ( qa ) − qa cos ( qa ) ) q 3 a 3 e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 . ( 2 . 17 ) 2 . 2 . 10 Scattering from N Spheres Consequently if one integrates over N spheres of constant density 1 V i and radius a i centered at positions { (cid:126)r i } , then the scattering amplitude would be given by the sum f ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , (cid:126)r 0 ) = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 NM (cid:88) i = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i 0 = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i 0 M (cid:88) j = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ji = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i 0 1 V i (cid:90) a i 0 r 2 dr (cid:90) d Ω e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r = e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 N (cid:88) i = 1 3 ( sin ( qa i ) − qa i cos ( qa i ) ) q 3 a 3 i e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r i 0 . ( 2 . 18 ) 30 Thus , the scattered intensity from a collection of spherical scatterers can be described by the equation ˜ P ( (cid:126)q ) = ( 2 . 19 ) (cid:80) Ni = 1 (cid:80) Nj = 1 (cid:181) 3 ( sin ( qa i ) − qa i cos ( qa i ) ) q 3 a 3 i (cid:182) (cid:181) 3 ( sin ( qa j ) − qa j cos ( qa j ) ) q 3 a 3 j (cid:182) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r ij . If we perform the angular averaging ( as in Eq . 2 . 16 ) we get the resulting equa - tion for a collection of spherical scatterers with ﬁxed relative internal positions but an overall random orientation : ˜ P ( q ) = ( 2 . 20 ) (cid:80) Ni = 1 (cid:80) Nj = 1 (cid:181) 3 ( sin ( qa i ) − qa i cos ( qa i ) ) q 3 a 3 i (cid:182) (cid:181) 3 ( sin ( qa j ) − qa j cos ( qa j ) ) q 3 a 3 j (cid:182) sin ( qr ij ) qr ij . This equation was ﬁrst explored by Debye [ 33 , 31 ] and is used later in this thesis to calculate the expected scattering of neutrons from simple bead models of clathrin . It assumes that the molecule is made up of scatterers having identical scattering length density relative to the solvent . 2 . 2 . 11 The Guinier Approximation Consider a rotationally averaged probablility density P ( q ) ( Eq . 2 . 16 ) for a mole - cule with a limited extent , R , such that r i 0 < R ∀ i . If we look only at small q , where qR (cid:191) 1 ( That is , if we are only looking at small scattering angles or using a large wavelength in comparison to R ) , we can expand the function sin ( x ) in a Taylor’s expansion sin ( x ) = (cid:80) ∞ i = 0 x 2 i + 1 2 i + 1 ! = x − x 3 6 + x 5 120 − O ( x 7 ) . 31 By inserting this expression in Eq . 2 . 16 , one gets ˜ P ( q ) = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 sin ( qr ij ) qr ij = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 1 − ( qr ij ) 2 6 − O ( qr ij ) 4 ≈ N 2 (cid:195) 1 − ( qR g ) 2 3 + ( qR g ) 4 18 − O ( qR g ) 6 (cid:33) ≈ N 2 e − 13 ( qR g ) 2 ( 2 . 21 ) In this last step we have used the identity R 2 g = 1 2 N 2 (cid:80) Ni = 0 (cid:80) Nj = 0 r 2 ij . This approxima - tion from small angle scattering was derived by Guinier [ 37 ] and will be used later to determine the radius of gyration , R g from static light scattering and neutron scatter - ing experiments performed on clathrin . The Guinier approximation [ 26 , p . 305 ] is valid only when 120 < R g q < 12 . The upper limit on R g arises because of the expansion of sin ( R g q ) used to derive the equation . The lower limit on R g is due to the accuracy with which the scattered light intensity can be measured , and therefore depends upon the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus that is used . In order to give a 10 % - 50 % drop in scattered intensity by variation of the detector angle , R g λ must be greater than 120 − 110 . In my static light scattering ( SLS ) experiments , the drop in intensity observed was 8 % in the q range that was used to determine the measured R g . Prior to each experiment , the instrument was calibrated to within 1 % for all angles used in the measurement . 5 5 The equation for the lower limit on particle size is R g λ > 14 π (cid:114) 3 ln (cid:179) I ( θ = 180 ) I ( θ = 0 ) (cid:180) . 32 2 . 3 Dynamic Light Scattering In the previous section we ignored the time dependence of the scattered wave as well as any motion or dynamics of the molecule from which we were scattering . Suppose that , instead of calculating an instantaneous probability density , which was done implicitly , we included the time dependence of the scattered probability density using time dependent scattering positions { r i ( t ) } instead of static ones . Our number density would then become time dependent ρ ( (cid:126)r , t ) = 1 V (cid:80) Ni = 1 δ 3 ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r i ( t ) ) and , following Eq . 2 . 15 and now including a time dependent factor e − iω 0 t , the scattered wave would be Ψ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , { r i ( t ) } , t ) = Ψ 0 e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 − iω 0 t (cid:90) V d 3 rρ ( (cid:126)r , t ) e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r . ( 2 . 22 ) If we wanted to proceed further , then we would have to know how { r i ( t ) } evolves in time . For simplicity , consider the case of N particles whose initial positions at time , t = 0 , are (cid:126)r 0 and whose motion is determined by diﬀusion . In that case , the average position of the particle would be (cid:126)r 0 and the mean squared displacement , < r 2 > , would be 6 Dt . We could then write the time dependent number density as ρ ( (cid:126)r , t ) = N ( √ 4 πDt ) 3 e − ( (cid:126)r − (cid:126)r 0 ) 2 4 Dt . And the time dependent scattered wave from N particles undergoing diﬀusive motion could be written as Ψ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , r 0 , t ) = N Ψ 0 e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 − iω 0 t (cid:90) V d 3 r e − r 2 4 Dt ( √ 4 πDt ) 3 e i(cid:126)q · (cid:126)r = N Ψ 0 e i(cid:126)k 0 · (cid:126)r 0 − iω 0 t e − Dq 2 t . ( 2 . 23 ) Using the above equation we can calculate the scattered intensity autocorrelation 33 function c ( τ ) = < ˜ P ( t ) ˜ P ( t + τ ) > = N 4 | Ψ 0 | 4 (cid:90) ∞ 0 dt Ψ ∗ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , r 0 , t ) Ψ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , r 0 , t ) × Ψ ∗ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , r 0 , t + τ ) Ψ ( (cid:126)k 0 , (cid:126)q , r 0 , t + τ ) = N 4 4 Dq 2 e − 2 Dq 2 τ . ( 2 . 24 ) This equation is the basis for dynamic light scattering as used later to determine the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of clathrin triskelia in solution . 2 . 4 Hydrodynamic Theory of Macromolecules Hydrodynamic techniques play a major role in the characterization of macro - molecules . Experimental hydrodynamics measurements include viscometric , sedimen - tation and diﬀusion measurements . However , relating these measurements to desired structural information requires a theoretical formalism enabling the calculation of hydrodynamic properties from a model of the macromolecule under study . In the case of ﬂexible and semiﬂexible linear chains , theoretical work was initi - ated by Kirkwood and Riseman [ 38 ] . Hydrodynamic formalisms for more complicated rigid structures were available only for ellipsoids and cylinders . Early theoretical work on the hydrodynamics of rigid particles with arbitrary shape began with the work of Bloomﬁeld et al . [ 39 , 40 ] . In this work the theory of Oseen , Burgers , Kirk - wood and Reisman [ 41 , 42 , 38 ] were used to calculate hydrodynamic properties of proteins ( hemocyanin , phycocyanin , and ﬁbrinogen ) and viruses ( Tobacco mosaic virus , T2 bacteriophage , and λ phage ) . Dynamic light scattering and sedimentation 34 measurements on each example were carefully compared with theoretical estimates from multi - subunit bead models with dimensions and geometry in accordance with electron microscope images that had been taken by other researchers . Advances to the work of Oseen were later made by Rotne and Prager [ 43 ] as well as Yamakawa [ 44 ] in the form of a modiﬁed hydrodynamic interaction tensor . Later with the aid of modern computers , Bloomﬁeld and Garcia de la Torre improved upon Kirkwood and Reisman’s approximation [ 45 , 46 , 47 ] . X - ray structures of proteins as well as cryo - EM reconstructions of macromolecular assemblies have dramatically improved the detail of structural models of some biological macromolecules . As an example of how the ﬁeld has progressed , ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy has recently been used to study tubulin rings , showing remarkable agreement with the predicted hydrodynamic properties using an atomic model of a tubulin ring structure that was determined by combining cryo - EM and X - ray diﬀraction measurements [ 48 ] . 2 . 4 . 1 Inversion of the Hydrodynamic Equations ( HYDRO ) In 1927 , Oseen showed that the eﬀect of a point source of friction on the ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid of viscosity , η , was to reduce the ﬂow velocity , (cid:126)v 0 , at a position , (cid:126)r , by an amount , δ(cid:126)v ≡ (cid:126)v − (cid:126)v 0 where (cid:126)v 0 is the velocity of ﬂow in the absence of the force and (cid:126)v is in the presence of the force . δ(cid:126)v is determined by the product of a hydrodynamic interaction tensor , T , with the applied force (cid:126)F , δ(cid:126)v = − T · (cid:126)F = − 1 8 πηr (cid:195) I + (cid:126)r T (cid:126)r r 2 (cid:33) · (cid:126)F . ( 2 . 25 ) A particle moving with velocity (cid:126)v through a stationary ﬂuid of viscosity , η , 35 produces a force , (cid:126)F , proportional to (cid:126)v on the surrounding ﬂuid in the direction of motion , (cid:126)F = ζ(cid:126)v where ζ is the coeﬃcient of friction . Neighboring particles will therefore reduce the ﬂow velocity and the viscous force between the surrounding ﬂuid and nearby particles . This is the basic principle behind hydrodynamic modeling of rigid biological macromolecules . The viscous force on a particle can be approximated by taking into account the eﬀect of forces by neighboring particles on the ﬂow velocity of the ﬂuid using Oseen’s tensor , (cid:126) F = ζ ( (cid:126)v − T · (cid:126) F ) ( 2 . 26 ) from which one ﬁnds Q · (cid:126)F = ( I + ζ T ) · (cid:126)F = ζ(cid:126)v ( 2 . 27 ) where T is a sum over all neighboring particles . Setting the force on the right hand side of the Eq . 2 . 26 to (cid:126)F ≈ ζ(cid:126)v , we get an approximation generally referred to as the Kirkwood - Riseman approximation [ 38 ] . If we solve the system of equations by inverting the matrix Q = I + ζ T for each element in the particle then we can calculate the entire friction tensor of a ﬁxed collection of particles . This is the principle behind current work involving the description of the hydrodynamics of polymers and biological macromolecules . Zwanzig [ 49 ] showed that if Oseens’ hydrodynamic interaction tensor ( deﬁned in Eq . 2 . 25 ) is used to calculate the friction of a bead model of ﬁnite size , then Q is not necessarily positive deﬁnite and can , in some cases , give negative friction coeﬃcients . Rotne and Prager [ 43 ] and Yamakawa [ 44 ] corrected this by including 36 the eﬀect of particle size in the hydrodynamic interaction tensor of Eq . 2 . 25 . This was done by using Stokes’ law for the coeﬃcient of friction of a sphere of radius a , ζ = 6 πηa for overlapping and nonoverlapping spheres . The nonoverlapping case was later generalized by Garcia de la Torre et al . [ 45 ] for spheres of diﬀerent sizes T ( a i , a j , (cid:126)r ij ) = 1 8 πηr ij (cid:34) I + (cid:126)r Tij (cid:126)r ij r 2 ij + a 2 i + a 2 j r 2 ij (cid:195) 1 3 I − (cid:126)r Tij (cid:126)r ij r 2 ij (cid:33)(cid:35) ( 2 . 28 ) the overlapping case ( r ≤ 2 a ) is T ( a , (cid:126)r ij ) = 1 6 πηa (cid:34)(cid:181) 1 − 9 32 r ij a (cid:182) I + 3 32 (cid:126)r Tij (cid:126)r ij ar ij (cid:35) ( 2 . 29 ) The remaining case , calculations with overlapping spheres of diﬀerent sizes , a i and a j , use Eq . 2 . 29 with a bead radius of a = 12 ( a 3 i + a 3 j ) 13 so that the volume of the two beads of equal size is the same as the volume of bead i and j . See Carrasco et al . for further discussion [ 50 ] . HYDRO 6 is a program written by Garcia de la Torre et al . [ 51 ] . Using the theory outlined above , HYDRO calculates the friction coeﬃcient of rigid macromolecules of arbitrary shape that are represented by bead models . I constructed an ad hoc bead model for clathrin based on EM , cryo - EM , and crystal structure measurements of clathrin arms . This model , as well as the results of HYDRO calculations performed with it , are described in Chapter 3 . The above described treatment for the direct inversion of the hydrodynamic equations represents a system of linear equations of 3 unknowns for each element in the model . This is accomplished by formulating the equations into a 3 N × 3 N super 6 http : / / leonardo . fcu . um . es / macromol / 37 matrix Q N . This matrix is then inverted by Gauss - Seidel iteration [ 51 ] . The Gauss - Seidel method is a fast iterative matrix inversion technique similar to the Gauss - Jordan method . Computation time scales approximately as N 3 and necessary storage space grows as 9 N 2 . This limits practical models to N ∼ 2000 elements on modern computers in 2006 ( N ∼ 100 in 1981 ) . This limitation is mainly due to the speed at which a computer can invert a matrix of size ( 3 N ) × ( 3 N ) , i . e . the rate of convergence of the Gauss - Seidel algorithm [ 52 , 53 ] . 2 . 4 . 2 The Analogy between Electrostatics and Hydrodynamics ( ZENO ) It is possible to calculate a rotationally averaged translational friction coeﬃcient for a rigid object using an alternative method proposed by Hubbard and Douglas [ 54 ] . If one performs an angular average of Oseen’s hydrodynamic interaction tensor , ( Eq 2 . 25 ) , it becomes a simple scalar . < T > Ω = 1 4 π (cid:90) d Ω T = 1 4 π (cid:90) d Ω 1 8 πηr (cid:195) I + (cid:126)r T (cid:126)r r 2 (cid:33) = 1 8 πηr (cid:181) I + 1 3 I (cid:182) = 1 6 πηr I ( 2 . 30 ) With this angular averaged hydrodynamic interaction tensor , it can then be shown that the Navier - Stokes equations reduce to an equivalent electrostatics problem where the angular averaged translational friction coeﬃcient of a particle can be related to the capacitance , C , on its surface as if it were conducting [ 54 ] . 38 < f > Ω = 6 πηC . ( 2 . 31 ) The capacitance , C , is easier to calculate for complicated objects than is the matrix inversion described in the section above , and has a less restrictive limit to the number of particles used in the model . Also , this calculation requires only that a surface be deﬁned in some way and is not , in principle , reliant on bead modeling . The capacitance calculation is done by a numerical path integration technique [ 55 ] in the program ZENO 7 . I used ZENO for calculations performed on high resolution triskelion models as well as on complete clathrin baskets . In some cases as many as 7000 elements were used . For models where HYDRO and ZENO could both be used , the rotationally averaged , translational friction coeﬃcients agreed in all cases tested to within 1 % . 7 http : / / www . stevens . edu / zeno / 3 . LIGHT SCATTERING FROM A CLATHRIN TRISKELION IN SOLUTION 3 . 1 Introduction Triskelia assemble at low pH to form baskets [ 14 ] or , at higher pH , in the presence of clathrin assembly proteins ( e . g . AP2 , AP180 , etc . ) [ 56 ] . It is not currently known why these conditions favor assembly . Possible mechanisms supporting assembly at low pH include conformational changes in the tertiary structure of the triskelia , which might relieve steric hindrances to basket assembly , and enhanced interactions between the intertwined triskelia that form the basket struts . The role of AP’s may be to increase mechanical linkages between the triskelia [ 56 , 57 , 58 ] . In this chapter I report light scattering measurements on clathrin in solution , which include conditions where assembly occurs . By static light scattering ( SLS ) I determine the radius of gyration ( R g ) , and by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) I determine the hydrodynamic radius ( R H ) , of triskelia that have not polymerized into baskets . Although one does not obtain atomic and molecular coordinates as one might from a diﬀraction experiment or cryo - EM tomography , light scattering provides weighted averages that are sensitive to diﬀerent aspects of the spatial distribution of 40 triskelion mass . In addition , the light scattering techniques are non - invasive and thus allow one to assess the native state of clathrin in solution . In this chapter I will compare the measured values of R g and R H with corre - sponding quantities calculated for a simpliﬁed model of a clathrin triskelion . The model is designed , in particular , to show dependences on triskelial pucker and leg bending . Where possible , I use leg segment dimensions based on X - ray and EM structural data . Using the model , I infer that both R g and R H are intimately linked to the geometric attributes of the triskelia and that , taken together , they provide a sensitive measure of the solution conformations of these complex objects . Analysis of the measurements indicates that , over a large range of pH , individual triskelia are puckered in solution . Recently , 3D structures of ”D6 barrel” clathrin cages have been used to infer a molecular model of a single clathrin triskelion [ 16 ] . The D6 barrel is a polyhedral as - sembly of 36 clathrin triskelia and associated AP2 assembly complexes . Calculations of R g and R H based on this model agree fairly well with our light scattering measure - ments on free clathrin triskelia , but indicate that a triskelion assumes a slightly more compact structure when incorporated into the cages . 3 . 2 Experimental Methods 3 . 2 . 1 Clathrin Puriﬁcation Clathrin was puriﬁed from coated vesicles of bovine brain as previously described by Morgan et al . [ 57 ] . Here I would like to thank and acknowledge K . Prasad and E . Lafer 41 of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio , who performed all of the protein puriﬁcation of clathrin . Brieﬂy , clathrin coated vesicles were separated from homogenized bovine brain tissue by a two step density gradient centrifugation in low concentrations of sucrose and D 2 O according to Nandi et al . [ 59 ] . The puriﬁed coated vesicles are then dialyzed in disassociation buﬀer ( 10mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 5 ) for 15 h . This causes the clathrin to uncoat the vesicles . Once uncoated the vesicles are then pelleted by centrifugation for 1 hr at 200 , 000 x g . The supernatant containing clathrin and associated proteins is then dialyzed in 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and gel ﬁltered on a Sephacryl S - 300 column to separate clathrin , which elutes ﬁrst , separate from the smaller molecular weight associated proteins . [ 60 ] Once puriﬁed the protein was stored in 0 . 5 M Tris HCl pH 7 . 0 , 3mM DTT , at a protein concentration of 3 to 4 mg / mL at 4 ◦ C , and used within 2 weeks . Every 24 hrs , prior to experiments , the protein was clariﬁed 1 at 400 , 000 x g for 15 minutes to remove any protein that was no longer viable due to misfolding or proteolysis . At the end of 2 weeks the amount of protein removed in this process was close to half of the total protein at which point the sample was judged to be no longer useful for experiments . 3 . 2 . 2 Sample Preparation For light scattering , buﬀers were ﬁltered three times through 0 . 22 µ m cellulose acetate ﬁlters ( Corning ) prior to use . Buﬀer was exchanged by overnight dialysis through a 1 Clariﬁcation simply means to sediment out particulates by centrifugation , taking only the top of the solution and leaving behind a solid pellet . 42 10 , 000 Da molecular weight cutoﬀ membrane ( Pierce ) into 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 . 0 , 3mM DTT . The protein was diluted to 0 . 34 mg / mL and clariﬁed by centrifugation at 400 , 000 x g for 15 minutes in an Optima Max Ultracentrifuge ( Beckman ) , using an MLA130 rotor . After centrifugation , the entire supernatant was taken . The protein concentration was found to remain constant to within 0 . 01 mg / ml . Soluble triskelia were prepared for light scattering at diﬀerent pH by adding 100 µ L of 1M MES buﬀer to 0 . 9 mL of clariﬁed protein solution . Samples were then incubated one hour on ice and centrifuged at 400 , 000 x g for 15 minutes to remove any assembled baskets . Only the top 80 % of the supernatant was carefully taken [ 57 ] . The preparation was conﬁrmed , by dynamic light scattering , to consist of mono - disperse clathrin triskelia . The clathrin concentration in these samples was determined by absorbance measurements at a wavelength of 280 nm , using an absorption coeﬃcient , (cid:178) 280 = 6 . 94 × 10 3 M − 1 cm − 1 ( 1 . 07 g − 1 cm − 1 ) , as estimated from the amino acid sequence from Bos Taurus and following the calculation given by Reference [ 61 ] . 3 . 2 . 3 Light Scattering Instrument We used a Brookhaven light scattering instrument ( Brookhaven Instruments Corp . , Holtsville , NY ) for both static and dynamic light scattering measurements . An Argon - ion laser ( Lexel ) beam , emitting at a wavelength of 514 . 5 nm , was directed onto the sample . Depending on the sample concentration , the incident intensity was adjusted to give a detectable scattered intensity of 100 , 000 counts per second at 90 ◦ scattering angle and ﬁxed detection pinhole ( 400 µ m or 1 mm in diameter ) . The scattered light was collected by a photomultiplier tube ( EMI - PMT Model 9863 ) and processed by a 43 Fig . 3 . 1 : Picture and diagram of light scattering instrument used . The beam from an argon ion laser was focused onto the sample through a steering lense assembly . The detector was mounted to an adjustable goniometer which could be rotated to the desired angle by a computer controlled motor . The detector signal was the processed by a digital correlator . Pictures and diagrams are take from Brookhaven Instruments Corp . c (cid:176) website : http : / / www . bic . com / BI - 200SMls . htm [ 62 ] 44 BI - 9000 AT data acquisition board ( Brookhaven Instruments Corp . ) . For DLS , the board calculates and generates the intensity - intensity time - correlation functions . A 1 mL volume of sample , loaded in a 1 inch diameter cylindrical light scat - tering cuvette , was placed in a decalin index - matching bath attached to a precision goniometer ( Brookhaven Instruments ) . The temperature of the bath was measured before and after each measurement , using a digital thermometer ( ± 0 . 1 ◦ C ) . 3 . 2 . 4 Static Light Scattering Scattered light intensity was measured every 2 ◦ , from a scattering angle of θ = 50 ◦ to 150 ◦ . Background scattering intensity from the cuvette and solvent was less than 1 % of the detected signal in all experiments . In the Guinier regime ( qR g < < 1 ) , the angular dependence of the scattered intensity , I ( q ) , is well approximated by a Gaussian proﬁle with a width related to the radius of gyration , I ( q ) ≈ exp (cid:181) − 1 3 q 2 R 2 g (cid:182) ( 3 . 1 ) where the scalar quantity q is the magnitude of the Bragg scattering wave vector [ 63 ] , viz . , q = 4 πn λ sin ( θ / 2 ) ( 3 . 2 ) λ , θ and n being the wavelength , the scattering angle , and the refractive index of the solution , respectively . The logarithm of the intensity proﬁle was plotted against q 2 and ﬁtted by a straight line [ 26 ] , using the method of least squares ( unweighted ) . The slope of the line is 1 / 3 R 2g . For any given sample , the measurements were repeated four times and the ﬁts yielded values for R g reproducible within 3 % ( 0 . 8 nm ) . 45 3 . 2 . 5 Dynamic Light Scattering Dynamic light scattering was performed at scattering angles of 90 ◦ and 150 ◦ . Photon counts collected over prescribed intervals were auto - correlated over a time range , τ , to provide the autocorrelation function of the scattered light , c ( τ ) . Data were collected in the homodyne mode , from which the ﬁeld correlation function , g ( τ ) , was determined by the following formula : c ( τ ) = A (cid:179) 1 + B | g ( τ ) | 2 (cid:180) ( 3 . 3 ) where A and B are constants [ 63 ] . In the homodyne mode only the scattered light impinges on the detector . This is in contrast to the heterodyne mode where a small portion of the incident beam is mixed with the scattered light on the detector 2 . In homodyne mode the light intensity autocorrelation function is proportional to the square of the ﬁeld correlation function , giving a relaxation timescale , τ ∝ 2 Dq 2 , in accord with Eq . 2 . 24 . Using the cumulant method , I ﬁtted the logarithm of the measured ﬁeld corre - lation function up to the 2nd cumulant by the equation [ 64 ] : 1 2 ln | g ( τ ) 2 | = ln | g ( τ ) | = − Dq 2 τ + 1 2 µq 4 τ 2 ( 3 . 4 ) where q is given by Eq . 3 . 2 , D is the average translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient , and µ is related to the width of the distribution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient . Both D and 2 The heterodyne mode is a technique by which the intensity autocorrelation function recorded in an experiment is directly proportional to the ﬁeld correlation function , g ( τ ) , and decays with a relaxation timescale , τ ∝ Dq 2 . 46 µ are the ﬁtting parameters . I then determined the mean hydrodynamic radius , R H , from the Stokes - Einstein relation : D = k B T / 6 πηR H ( 3 . 5 ) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T the temperature , and η the solvent viscosity . For a given sample , two correlation functions were collected at θ = 90 ◦ and two at θ = 150 ◦ and ﬁtted with the expression in Eq . 3 . 5 , yielding values for R H reproducible within 1 % ( 0 . 2 nm ) . Here the buﬀer viscosity ( for 0 . 1 M MES ) was taken to be 1 . 05 times that of water , in accordance with measurements made with an Ostwald viscometer at 20 ◦ C ( data not shown ) . 3 . 2 . 6 Hydrodynamic Modeling Transport properties of clathrin triskelia were calculated using HYDRO [ 51 ] and ZENO [ 55 ] . To employ these programs , triskelia of diﬀering shapes were approxi - mated by groups of connected spheres . Calculations primarily were performed with the program HYDRO [ 53 , 51 ] , which uses a hydrodynamic interaction tensor and Stokes’ solution for ﬂow around a sphere to determine the frictional force on a rigid bead model by an iterative matrix inversion of the hydrodynamic equations [ 53 ] . The resultant frictional coeﬃcient of the structure then is related to the hydrodynamic ra - dius , R H . A recent experimental study of the hydrodynamic properties of nanoscopic rings , formed from the cytoskeletal protein tubulin , showed extremely good quanti - tative agreement between measurements and parameters computed by this method [ 48 ] . ZENO uses a Monte Carlo , numerical path integral technique to estimate the 47 translational diﬀusivity by making an analogy between isotropic angular averaged hydrodynamics and electrostatics [ 54 , 55 ] . Like HYDRO , it also uses an iterative algorithm . It allows for more complex models than does HYDRO , the latter being limited to 2000 beads . When I compared these programs , ZENO gave results for R H within 1 % of those determined by HYDRO , for all models tested . 3 . 3 Results 3 . 3 . 1 Light Scattering Clathrin assembles into closed , basket - like structures at low pH and low salt concentration [ 14 ] . The baskets can be removed by centrifugation , while unassembled clathrin remains in the supernatant . Above a pH of 6 . 5 , basket formation occurs relatively slowly and is only weakly dependent on pH , whereas at pH 6 . 0 most of the clathrin is quickly incorporated into closed polyhedra . After centrifuging the bas - kets from these samples , DLS measurements made on the supernatants show highly mono - disperse scatterers having an average value of r H = 16 . 9 nm for the appar - ent hydrodynamic radius . The reduced second moment , µ / D 2 had an average value of 0 . 06 ± 0 . 03 and did not vary signiﬁcantly with pH . Typical results from light scattering measurements are shown in Fig . 3 . 2 and 3 . 3 . Fig . 3 . 2 shows typical SLS data for clathrin in solution , where the vertical lines indicate the q range over which the data were ﬁtted to a linear function to determine the value of R g ( see Eq . 3 . 1 ) . In Fig . 3 . 3 typical DLS data are shown as well as the result of the quadratic ﬁt ( see Eq . 3 . 4 ) used to determine the value of R H ( see Eq . 48 Fig . 3 . 2 : Plotting ln I ( q ) vs . q 2 yields a slope of 13 R 2 g .

Radius of gyration ( R g ) and hydro - dynamic radius ( R H ) of free clathrin triskelia measured by static light scattering ( SLS ) and dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) . The abscissa indicates the pH of the buﬀered solution . Both measurements appear to be independent of pH . The ar - rows point to the values calculated by ZENO [ 54 , 55 ] for the triskelial structure noted for clathrin in an assembled basket [ 16 ] . Each data point was taken on a diﬀerent sample . Error bars represent standard deviations of four measurements on the same sample . [ 62 ] We measured a hydrodynamic radius , R H , and radius of gyration , R g , for free clathrin in solutions of diﬀerent pH and found that , within experimental error , they are almost independent of pH . As previously mentioned , clathrin baskets were re - 51 moved by centrifugation prior to light scattering . Even so , at low pH clathrin con - tinues to assemble , albeit at slower rates due to the reduced clathrin concentrations resulting from the elimination of polymerized material . ( The protein concentration after centrifugation at pH 6 . 0 was 0 . 11 ± 0 . 03 mg / ml ) . Thus , data were acquired as soon as possible after the centrifugation step . Measurements took 2 to 10 minutes to complete . Ignoring the data taken at pH 6 . 0 , which were the most diﬃcult points to repeat because of the tendency of triskelia to self - assemble , one ﬁnds an average value of R g = 22 . 2 ± 1 . 8 nm and R H = 16 . 9 ± 0 . 3 nm , with no signiﬁcant pH dependence . Light scattering measurements of triskelia immersed in pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 5 M Tris buﬀer yield similar values ( See Table 3 . 1 and 4 . 1 ) . The bold arrows in Fig . 3 . 4 indicate the values of R H and R g calculated by applying ZENO [ 54 , 55 ] to the triskelial structure found in a D6 basket assembled in the presence of AP2 assembly complexes ( PDB code 1XI4 [ 16 ] ) mentioned in the introduction . Interestingly , the R H and R g derived from the solution measurements are close to , but somewhat greater than , values calculated for the conﬁguration of the clathrin triskelion in the basket ( see Table 3 . 1 ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Calculations Using the Cryo - EM Structure of a Triskelion The calculations of R H and R g for the shape of a triskelion within a basket were initially performed with the program HYDRO . A modiﬁed 2 . 1 nm resolution structure for a clathrin triskelion in a D6 basket was generously provided by T . Kirchhausen ( triskelion . pdb [ 5 ] ) . These coordinates were determined by combining partial structures determined by X - ray diﬀraction studies with cryo - EM tomography 52 of a clathrin basket [ 65 ] . This structure was used to generate a rigid bead model for a clathrin triskelion which the program HYDRO could then use to calculate an approximate R H and R g . The 192 coordinates of this structure located the centers of contiguous beads , these centers being , on average , 0 . 76 ± 0 . 10 nm apart . the bead diameter was chosen to equal the average leg thickness of 3 . 0 nm , determined from the partial crystal structure for the α - solenoid clathrin proximal leg ( PDB code 1B89 [ 22 ] ) . ( See Fig . 2 . 2a . ) In order to account for the β - propeller N - terminus , which was not resolved by the cryo - EM tomography , this model was completed by the addition of 5 . 0 nm beads to the ends of the legs in accordance with the partial crystal structure ( PDB code 1BPO [ 11 ] ) , shown in Fig . 2 . 2b . The bead model described above for an entire clathrin triskelion is shown in Fig . 3 . 10e . The radius of gyration , R g , was calculated with this model , but a 0 . 3 nm hy - dration layer was added for the calculation of the hydrodynamic radius . ( A single molecule of water is approximately 0 . 3 nm . ) The results of HYDRO calculations on this structure are shown in the second and third rows of Table 3 . 1 . Recently , a higher resolution cryo - EM structure for clathrin in a D6 basket became available [ 16 ] . In this structure , presented in the form of carbon alpha ( C α ) coordinates of each amino acid in the protein ( PDB code 1XI4 [ 16 ] ) , the terminal domains and part of the light chain peptides now resolved , at 1 . 25 nm resolution . Similar to the method of Tirado Garcia et al . [ 66 , 67 ] , we approximated amino acids by spheres of radius 0 . 36 nm . This radius was then increased by 0 . 3 nm to simulate a hydration layer for calculation of R H . In this case the amino acids were each approximated by a sphere of radius 0 . 66 nm . The resulting model contained 5100 53 Tab . 3 . 1 : Experimental Values and Model Calculations of R H and R g of Clathrin Triskelion a [ 62 ] R H ( nm ) R g ( nm ) light - scattering measurement b 16 . 9 ± 0 . 3 c 22 . 2 ± 1 . 8 HYDRO calculation using a 21 ˚ A resolution structure 14 . 8 d 19 . 3 d with the hydration layer 15 . 3 d ZENO calculation using a 12 . 5 ˚A resolution structure 15 . 4 ± 0 . 3 19 . 9 ± 0 . 06 with the hydration layer 15 . 8 ± 0 . 3 a The R H and R g of clathrin from light scattering is displayed in the ﬁrst row .

HYDRO is limited to 2000 spheres and thus could not be used to calculate R H in this case . Instead , ZENO [ 55 ] was used to perform the hydrodynamic calculations . Results of these calculations are shown in rows four and ﬁve of Table 3 . 1 . Due to the complexity of this model convergence is slow , and uncertainties ( which are shown next to each calculated value ) should be noted . 3 . 3 . 3 Calculations Using a Segmented Bead Model In order to estimate the sensitivity of R g and R H to changes in clathrin pucker and leg bending , I used a simpler model of a clathrin triskelion ( see Fig . 3 . 5 ) . While our model diﬀers from the protein structures described above , it still captures essential features and uses recent estimates of the dimensions of the clathrin heavy chain and terminal domain . Each leg was given a length of 52 nm , in correspondence with measurements made from transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images of clathrin [ 17 , 9 , 10 ] . In order to model the solution structures for comparison with DLS data , a bead diameter of 3 . 0 nm , derived from the partial crystal structure for the clathrin proximal leg ( PDB code 1B89 [ 22 ] ) , was augmented by an additional 0 . 6 nm to approximate the eﬀect of a single layer of bound water needed when calculating R H . Thus , sixteen beads ( total diameter 3 . 6 nm ) were used , with centers spaced 3 . 0 nm apart . In contrast , the calculations of R g were performed for structures modeled with 16 beads of 3 . 0 nm diameter , as the layer of bound water should be essentially invisible in static light scattering measurements . One sphere of the same diameter 55 Fig . 3 . 5 : Diagram of simple model of a clathrin triskelion showing dimensions used in our model . Arrows pointing towards a circle indicate the radius of the circle . Lengths are in nanometers and angles are in degrees . The dotted lines indicate the added hydration layer . 56 was also placed at the hub where the legs join . A larger bead of diameter 5 . 0 nm was added at the end of each leg to account for the terminal domain , in accord with the aforementioned partial crystal structure ( PDB code 1BPO [ 11 ] ) . Again , when calculating R H , an additional 0 . 6 nm was added to this bead to account for bound water . Fig . 3 . 6 : Bead models deﬁning pucker angle , leg bend angle and swivel angles used in modeling . ( a ) The leg bend angle , ϕ , and ( b ) pucker angle , ψ , were varied from 30 ◦ to 180 ◦ and 30 ◦ to 90 ◦ , respectively . ( c ) The swivel angle , χ , was varied parametrically with the pucker angle according to the equation χ = 3 ( ψ − 30 ) / 2 , where ψ is measured from the vertical axis shown in ( b ) . Each leg included a bend halfway down its length and an out - of - plane pucker measured with respect to a perpendicular line passing through the vertex , deﬁned by the angles ϕ and ψ respectively . A third angle , the “swivel angle” , was varied along the axis of the central leg segment parametrically with the “pucker angle” according to the equation χ = 3 ( ψ − 30 ) / 2 . As the “pucker angle” is varied from 90 ◦ to 30 ◦ the “swivel angle” varies from 90 ◦ to 0 ◦ degrees . This equation was selected so that the model structure would change from planar ( Fig . 3 . 6a ) , similar to that seen in TEM micrographs of individual triskelia on carbon or mica surfaces ( Fig . 2 . 1a ) , to 57 puckered ( Fig . 3 . 6b and c ) , similar to the cryo - EM structures of a triskelion in a clathrin coat ( Fig . 2 . 1b and 2 . 3 ) as the pucker angle was varied . Three fold symmetry about the perpendicular was assumed . By changing the angles ϕ , ψ and χ , I was able to obtain a quantitative esti - mate of the sensitivity of R g and R H to the conformation of the triskelion as the model changed from planar to puckered . I found that the radius of gyration is much more sensitively dependent on conformation than is the hydrodynamic radius . Both quantities , however , vary considerably for the cases studied , and together provide a distinctive measure of any change in solution conformation . In Fig . 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 , I show R H and R g calculated by HYDRO for diﬀerent values of bend angle , ϕ , and pucker angle , ψ and compare them with values measured from experiment ( repre - sented by the shaded planes ) . Note that at ψ = 90 ◦ there is no pucker , i . e . , the molecule is completely planar , and when ϕ = 180 ◦ the legs are completely straight ( see Fig . 3 . 6 ) . There is considerable degeneracy , in that several pairs of [ ϕ , ψ ] are consistent with the measured values . To show this , I combined the information from Fig . 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 to produce Fig . 3 . 9 . The upper and lower dark lines ( blue and red ) indicate the locus of [ ϕ , ψ ] values commensurate with the measured R g and R H respectively . The upper and lower shaded regions in Fig . 3 . 9 indicate [ ϕ , ψ ] pairs yielding values of R H and R g , lying within one standard deviation of the respective measured mean values . One can see there is a very narrow band of model conformations ( indicated by the overlapping crosshatched region ) that are consistent with both the radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius measured by both static and dynamic light 58 Fig . 3 . 7 : Surface plots of modeled R g compared with experimental value . Values of R g calculated for our model are shown in the thin black curves . The shaded surface is a ﬂat plane drawn parallel to the plane deﬁned by the ϕ , ψ axes ( relating to the leg - bend and pucker angles in our model ) . It shows the average , experimentally - measured , value R g = 22 . 2 nm . Hence , the dark line indicates the locus of [ ϕ , ψ ] values commensurate with the measured R g . [ 62 ] 59 Fig . 3 . 8 : Surface plots of modeled R H compared with experimental value . Values of R H calculated for our model are shown in the thin black curves . Similar to what is shown in Fig . 3 . 7 , the shaded surface is a ﬂat plane drawn at the average experimentally - measured value R H = 16 . 9 nm . The dark line indicates the locus of [ ϕ , ψ ] values commensurate with the measured R H [ 62 ] 60 Fig . 3 . 9 : Combination of Fig . 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 . Values of [ ϕ , ψ ] for which calculations based on the segmented bead model match the values for both R g ( lower line ) and R H ( upper line ) determined from light scattering measurements . The upper and lower dark lines ( blue and red ) are the respective dark lines of Figures 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 indicating the locus of [ ϕ , ψ ] values commensurate with the measured R g and R H . The upper and lower bands indicate those values of [ ϕ , ψ ] lying within one standard deviation of the measured mean values of R g and R H . The region of overlapping bands indicates the range of angles that are compatible with the experimental data from both SLS and DLS . Letters ( a - d ) indicate models in accord with experimental data , ( e ) indicates the corresponding [ ϕ , ψ ] for a triskelion in a D6 basket ( These models are shown in Figure 3 . 10 ) ; extreme triskelion shapes corresponding to the [ ϕ , ψ ] at the four corners of the graph also are shown . [ 62 ] 61 scattering of free clathrin triskelia in solution . Some compatible structures are shown in Fig . 3 . 10 ( a - d ) . I also indicate the conformations that correspond to the [ ϕ , ψ ] values at the corners of the graph . The letter ”e” locates the [ ϕ , ψ ] pair that was found to be most similar to structures shown in Fig . 3 . 10e’ and 3 . 10f’ . 3 . 4 Summary and Discussion Previous TEM investigations indicated a characteristic , pinwheel - like shape for isolated clathrin triskelia absorbed to mica surfaces , the triskelia having a preferred orientation that depends on the buﬀer in which they are suspended [ 17 , 14 ] . Based on these studies , quantitative analysis of images of diﬀering handedness [ 17 ] led to the inference that free triskelia are puckered , with their hubs raised above the plane deﬁned , by the ends of each of the legs . In those studies , to ensure that they did not associate , the triskelia were suspended in buﬀers of pH 8 . 0 when aﬃxed to the mica substrates . I have expanded this work by using dynamic and static light scattering to investigate the conformations of individual clathrin triskelia when free in solution , also extending the investigation to a lower range of pH ( pH 6 . 0 - 6 . 5 ) . The experi - mental shape descriptors are the radius of gyration , R g , and hydrodynamic radius , R H . By using light scattering , possible structural perturbations of the triskelia due to interactions with EM grids are eliminated . This study yields three main conclusions . First , I have conﬁrmed that clathrin legs are bent and puckered in solution . To obtain this result , I used HYDRO to cal - culate R g and R H for particular test structures and systematically varied parameters 62 Fig . 3 . 10 : Models that ﬁt experimental measurement using SLS and DLS ( a - d ) and mod - els based on cryo - EM measurements ( e - f ) . ( a - d ) indicate the models speciﬁed by the corresponding [ ϕ , ψ ] , and ( e - f ) show models of a clathrin triskelion de - rived from 2 . 1 nm and 1 . 25 nm resolution cryo - EM tomography of D 6 barrels , respectively [ 65 , 16 ] . 63 to see which conformations are consistent with the measured data . Yoshimura et al . [ 68 ] , in a more limited study , investigated triskelia in slightly alkaline solutions ( pH 8 . 0 ) , but modeled them by two dissimilar planar objects when ﬁtting either R g or R H . Using this approach , Yoshimura et al . concluded that the solution structures of triskelia in low ionic strength TRIS and TEA buﬀers ( pH 8 . 0 ) are not discernibly diﬀerent , even though triskelia in such samples demonstrate a diﬀerent handedness when placed onto mica surfaces . In this study I use identical nonplanar models when calculating R g and R H to determine the solution conformations of the triskelia . Second , there is a diﬀerence between the solution and basket associated confor - mations . Cryo - EM of small D6 barrels yields coordinates of a puckered triskelion [ 65 ] . Quantitative predictions of R g and R H calculated for these shapes diﬀer from val - ues measured for triskelia in solution . However , the structures are relatively close , indicating that the insertion of a triskelion into such an assembly does not require that it undergo a major conformational change . In this regard I note that baskets of diﬀering sizes are found even when they are reconstituted in vitro from puriﬁed clathrin alone [ 14 , 69 , 13 ] , and that slight diﬀerences in leg conformation are observed when one compares triskelia localized to diﬀerent positions in baskets reconstituted in the presence of AP2 [ 65 ] . Moreover , the baskets are limited in size ( few exceeding ca . 120 nm in diameter ) , suggesting that , beyond a certain point , a conformation - linked unfavorable energy term may overwhelm favorable interaction energy gained due to the association of the clathrin legs [ 70 , 58 ] . That these might be mechanical in nature is suggested by the fact that large reconstituted clathrin structures are observed only 64 when the triskelia lack distal segments , in which case leg bending is suppressed and large , essentially ﬂat , structures are observed [ 71 ] . Finally , signiﬁcant conformational changes in clathrin triskelia are not observed across the pH range known to make the diﬀerence between clathrin cage assembly and disassembly . It has been observed that , within experimental error , R g and R H do not change as the pH is lowered from 7 . 0 , where basket formation is inhibited , through the ”assembly transition” ( occurring at pH 6 . 5 → 6 . 3 ) , to a value ( pH 6 . 0 ) where essentially all triskelia are rapidly incorporated into baskets . One might have expected conformational changes to occur as conditions were varied from those that disfavor basket assembly to those which induce polymerization . However , as previously mentioned , basket formation is aﬀected by attractive interactions between clathrin legs that are resisted by leg bends and other triskelion shape changes . Thus , our failure to ﬁnd signiﬁcant conformational change is important , as it suggests that lowering the pH may aﬀect the mechanical properties of the triskelia ( e . g . , the rigidity ) or enhance inter - leg interactions that favor basket formation ( e . g . , by changing the ionization state of histidine groups [ 72 ] ) . The light scattering methods employed in this study are not suﬃciently sensitive to demonstrate very small ( sub nanometer ) changes in the solution structure of the triskelia . Other methods could provide information about triskelia in solution . How - ever , several that immediately come to mind are not yet developed to the point where they can be usefully employed to study molecules of such size . NMR spectroscopy , for example , currently is limited to proteins whose molecular weight does not exceed ca . 40 - 50 kDa , whereas triskelia have a molecular weight that is an order of magnitude 65 greater ( > 600 , 000 Da ) . Similarly , cryo - EM is problematic due to the irregular shapes of the triskelia and the slenderness of their legs . Analytical ultracentrifugation in ef - fect provides the same information as does DLS ( the Svedberg coeﬃcient , S , which is obtained by ﬁtting sedimentation data to the Lamb equation [ 30 ] , can be directly related to R H ) but , by itself , does not yield enough information to discriminate be - tween various model conformations . Measurements of R g ( which is more sensitive to triskelial shape than is R H ) are needed if one wishes to narrow the range of possible structures and thereby eliminate uncertainty about triskelial shape . By using DLS , one is able to determine R H on the same sample as that used for the measurement of R g . In summary , this study utilizes DLS and SLS techniques , in a consistent way , to study the solution structures of clathrin triskelia . It is concluded that a triskelion has an intrinsic pucker , that the solution structure diﬀers from that of a triskelion in a D6 basket , and that large conformational changes do not occur as the pH is lowered below the assembly transition . The wavelength of light is just short enough to determine information about the triskelion structure . In the next chapter I will describe small angle neutrons scattering ( SANS ) experiments that were performed in isolated clathrin triskelia in solution . These measurements will be similar to SLS but will extent to higher q probing the triskelion on shorter length scales than light . 4 . SMALL ANGLE NEUTRON SCATTERING FROM CLATHRIN IN SOLUTION 4 . 1 Introduction In addition to visible light scattering techniques that probe the diﬀusion coeﬃ - cient and radius of gyration of a molecule , we can use other methods to noninvasively measure physiochemical properties of clathrin that are related to its structure in so - lution . In this chapter I describe small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) experiments performed on clathrin triskelia . The scattered intensity measured by static light scat - tering , described in Chapter 3 , gave the radius of gyration when ﬁtted by a Gaussian model function : I ( q ) ≈ e − 13 ( R g q ) 2 . SANS allowed us to measure the continuation of the scattering function beyond the Gaussian Guinier regime . Since the neutron wavelength is much smaller than that of light ( 5 . 5˚A for SANS as opposed to 5145 ˚A for SLS ) , it was hoped that measuring the scattering function at higher resolution might give us more information about the protein structure than the R g , which is the second moment of the particle distribution function , ρ ( (cid:126)r ) deﬁned in Section 2 . 2 . 7 . In early diﬀraction studies , Debye and others , using Eq . 2 . 16 , evaluated the scattering function in a few simple cases for molecules of diﬀerent shapes which were suspended in solution [ 36 , 34 , 35 ] . They found , for example : 67 1 . A uniform and spherical scattering density of radius a , ( See Eq . 2 . 17 . ) : P ( q ) = 9 ( sin ( qa ) − qa cos ( qa ) ) 2 q 6 a 6 ; ( 4 . 1 ) 2 . A non - uniform spherical scattering density with a Gaussian radial mass distri - bution function of width R g , ρ ( r ) = e − r 2 2 R 2 g , corresponding to a random coil ( or Gaussian chain ) : P ( q ) = 2 R 4 g q 4 (cid:179) e − R 2 g q 2 − ( 1 − R 2 g q 2 ) (cid:180) ; ( 4 . 2 ) 3 . An inﬁnitely thin rigid rod of length L : P ( q ) = 2 qL (cid:90) qL 0 dx sinx x − 1 ( qL / 2 ) 2 sin ( qL / 2 ) 2 . ( 4 . 3 ) Cases 1 and 3 are useful for some particles that have well - deﬁned spherical and rod - like shapes , such as some viruses . Case 2 is useful for very ﬂexible objects of any type ( most studied are diﬀerent types of linear , star and branched polymers ) where dynamics and ﬂuctuations are on very fast timescales compared with measurement or diﬀusion times . Others have calculated the eﬀect of ﬂexibility for a semi - ﬂexible linear chain [ 73 ] and found a transition from q − 2 behavior of the scattering function for a random coil ( case 2 ) to the q − 1 of a rigid rod ( case 3 ) . The transition occurs at a value of q that is related to the persistence length ( a measure of ﬂexibility ) of the linear chain . This connects the limiting cases between case 3 and case 2 with increasing ﬂexibility . For a number of reasons , the clathrin triskelion is distinct from many other macromolecules and proteins that have been studied by neutron diﬀraction . The ﬁrst reason is that the clathrin triskelion is a very large macromolecular complex 68 containing about 92 , 000 atoms . Another is that the clathrin triskelion has a three armed pinwheel - like tertiary structure , as mentioned earlier . Because of the triske - lion’s large size and strange shape , it may be expected that the previous models , originally investigated by Debye and others and frequently used to interpret experi - mental measurements on smaller molecules of a simpler geometry , may not ﬁt . It was thought that a more appropriate model may be required based on other structural measurements performed with other techniques on triskelia in various environments . The angular dependence of the scattered intensity from a randomly oriented molecule of arbitrary shape , approximated as a collection of N identical scatterers , can be calculated using the Debye equation ( See Section 2 . 2 . 5 ) , P ( q ) = N (cid:88) i = 1 N (cid:88) j = 1 f i ( q ) f j ( q ) sin ( qr ij ) qr ij ( 4 . 4 ) where f ( q ) is the scattering amplitude of a single scatterer . For a sphere of radius a , f ( q ) is given by Eq . 2 . 17 , f ( q ) = 3 ( sin ( qa ) − qa cos ( qa ) ) / ( qa ) 3 and Eq . 4 . 4 becomes Eq . 2 . 20 of Section 2 . 2 . Neutron diﬀraction has been used to verify protein structures obtained by other techniques . For example , one can compare structures measured by X - ray diﬀraction from crystallized samples or electron microscopy with that of neutron scattering from protein in solution where the molecule is in a more natural environment [ 74 , 75 ] . 4 . 2 Experimental Methods Small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) measurements were performed on puri - ﬁed clathrin triskelia in solution in order to extend the SLS measurements , discussed 69 in Chapter 3 , into a region of higher q - values , corresponding to shorter length scales . Measurements were made on samples of puriﬁed clathrin in disassociation buﬀer , 0 . 5 M Tris ( 2 - amino - 2 - hydroxymethyl - 1 , 3 - propanediol ) pH 7 . 0 , in H 2 O and in basket as - sembly buﬀer , 0 . 1 M MES ( 2 - ( 4 - morpholino ) ethanesulphonic acid ) , at low and high pH ( 6 . 0 and 7 . 0 ) in H 2 O . This experiment was done in order to determine if the scat - tering function from puriﬁed clathrin triskelia in solution was dependent on buﬀer type or pH . In order to reduce incoherent scattering , SANS measurements were made on clathrin in D 2 O buﬀers , making it possible to take measurements at even higher q - values than in an H 2 O solvent . 4 . 2 . 1 Sample Preparation Clathrin protein was puriﬁed from coated vesicles of bovine brain as discussed in Chapter 3 . Clathrin samples in D 2 O were dialyzed into D 2 O buﬀers at a pD ∗ value of 7 . 0 for the sample measured in disassociation buﬀer , and at pD ∗ values of 6 . 0 and 7 . 4 in basket assembly buﬀers . It should be noted here that pD ∗ values reported were all measured by a glass electrode pH meter and so read at a value of 0 . 4 units below the actual pD ( = − log 10 | [ D + ] | ) : pD = pD ∗ + 0 . 4 units . On the day of the SANS experiment , all samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 83 , 000 rpm using a Beckman MLA130 rotor ( corresponding to an acceleration of ∼ 400 , 000 g ) . The concentration after centrifugation was between 2 . 6 and 3 . 1 g / L . 70 Samples were then diluted into the buﬀer used for dialysis to a protein concentration of between 1 . 5 and 2 . 4 g / L . This was done so that the volume would be ∼ 300 µL , ﬁlling up the entire cuvette . For low and high pH MES samples , puriﬁed clathrin samples at a concentration of 3 . 2 g / L in 0 . 5 M Tris buﬀer at pH 7 . 0 + 3 mM DTT were dialyzed overnight , at a temperature of 4 ◦ C in 10 , 000 molecular weight dialysis cassettes ( Pierce Bio ) , into 30 mL of 0 . 01 M Tris buﬀer at pH / pD ∗ 8 . 0 + 3 mM DTT in H 2 O / D 2 O . Immediately prior to the experiment , 1 / 10 volume of 1M MES buﬀer was added to a clathrin sample . For samples in D 2 O , 1 / 10 volume of 1M MES in D 2 O was added to the clathrin sample . Each sample was then loaded into a 1 mm thick quartz cuvette . For the clathrin sample in 0 . 5 M Tris D 2 O buﬀer , a puriﬁed clathrin sample at a concentration of 3 . 2 g / L in 0 . 5 M Tris buﬀer of H 2 O at pH 7 . 0 + 3 mM DTT was dialyzed overnight , at a temperature of 4 ◦ C in 10 , 000 molecular weight dialysis cassettes ( Pierce Bio ) , into 30 mL of 0 . 5 M Trizma in D 2 O . The sample was then loaded into a 1 mm thick quartz cuvette . 0 . 5 M Tris D 2 O buﬀers were made by the addition of Trizma ( Tris - HCl c (cid:176) Sigma - Aldrich ) to 99 . 9 % D 2 O . This dissolved to a pH of 5 . 6 and allowed us to add NaOH dissolved in D 2 O to get to pD ∗ 7 . The ﬁnal buﬀer contained ∼ 97 % D 2 O due to the inadvertent addition of 3 mL of H 2 O and 750 µL of 0 . 5 M DTT in H 2 O to 120 mL of D 2 O buﬀer ( experimental error ) . Concentrations were measured by UV absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm as described in Chapter 3 . 71 4 . 2 . 2 Light Scattering All SLS and DLS measurements of clathrin in solution were made as described in Chapter 3 . 4 . 2 . 3 Neutron Scattering Experiments were performed on the NCNR NG - 3 30 meter Small Angle Neutron Scattering Instrument . A diagram of the instrument is shown in Fig . 4 . 1 . The wavelength of neutrons used was 5 . 5 ± 0 . 4˚A ( 0 . 8˚A FWHM ) at sample to detector distances of both 13 . 16 and 5 . 00 meters . q - values ranged from ≈ 0 . 003 to 0 . 04 ˚A − 1 and 0 . 01 to 0 . 1 ˚A − 1 , respectively . Multiple data ﬁles were recorded for acquisition times between 15 minutes to 1 hour and were later added together . Total data acquisition times for each sample were between 3 and 5 hours per sample . Protein concentrations were between 1 . 5 and 2 . 4 g / L . Neutron transmission was 83 - 86 % in D 2 O and ∼ 52 % in H 2 O . Typical raw data are shown in Fig . 4 . 2 for a detector distance of 13 . 2 m and in Fig . 4 . 3 for a detector distance of 5m . Circular averages were done in order to improve data statistics . Background scattering was measured for empty cuvettes ( for 1 hour ) and buﬀers in both H 2 O ( 4 hours ) and D 2 O ( 2 hours ) . 4 . 3 Results 4 . 3 . 1 Testing D 2 O as a Solvent for Clathrin Due to the absence of hydrogen in the sample , higher signal to background can be achieved during a neutron scattering experiment when D 2 O ( 2 H 2 O ) is used as a 72 Fig . 4 . 1 : ( top ) Diagram of SANS NG3 instrument used : “Cold neutrons from the source pass through a multi - disk mechanical velocity selector with variable speed and pitch , enabling both the mean wavelength and wave - length resolution to be varied .

The source iris can be preceded by up to eight 1 . 5 m guide sections that can be shifted in or out of the beam .

The Instrument is designed to cover a wide q - range , from 0 . 0015 to nearly 0 . 6 ˚A − 1 . ” Figure and caption taken from http : / / www . ncnr . nist . gov / instruments / ng3sans / index . html .

The top and right axes are in units of ˚A − 1 . The sample to detector distance was 13 . 16 meters . The graph on the right shows a circular average of the image on the left in absolute units ( 1 / cm ) . The protein concentrations was measured to be 1 . 45 mg / mL by UV absorbance . 74 Fig . 4 . 3 : Raw SANS data of clathrin baskets in D 2 O at a detector distance of 5 meters . A 1 hour exposure of clathrin baskets in 0 . 1 M MES pH 6 . 0 D 2 O buﬀer . ( Compare to Fig . 4 . 2 ) The sample to detector distance was 5 meters . The protein concentration was measured to be 2 . 28 mg / mL by UV absorbance . solvent . This is because D 2 O has a smaller incoherent scattering cross section than H 2 O for neutron scattering . ( See Table 2 . 1 ) The result is that a lower background scattering is achieved in the angular intensity proﬁle . This can be readily seen by the higher transmission eﬃciency in the D 2 O samples , which was ∼ 83 - 86 % in D 2 O and ∼ 52 % in H 2 O . D 2 O has many of the same properties as H 2 O , but it has been found to aﬀect some biological macromolecules [ 76 , 74 ] and therefore should be tested as a solvent in each particular case . It was necessary to check that clathrin remains folded properly and maintains its functionality when D 2 O is used as a solvent . For this reason light scattering experiments were performed on clathrin triskelia dissolved in D 2 O buﬀers . For comparison , neutron scattering was performed on protein samples in H 2 O as well . In those samples our sensitivity was limited to q values for which the neutron 75 scattering intensity due to the presence of protein was on the order of or larger than the incoherent scattering due to the solvent . In practice , this limited us to q values below 0 . 025 ˚A − 1 as can be seen by the magnitude of the error bars on the experimental SANS data shown in Fig . 4 . 6 . Clathrin Maintains Its Structure in D 2 O To test the stability of clathrin in D 2 O , both static and dynamic light scatter - ing measurements were performed . In light scattering , diﬀerent solvents can aﬀect measurements through changes in relative index of refraction between the solvent and solute , which will aﬀect q dependence as well as the intensity of the scattered light . Another is a change in viscosity , which will aﬀect the diﬀusion of the particles and aﬀect the DLS measurement . The index of refraction for D 2 O , shown in Table 2 . 1 , is very close to that of H 2 O . The viscosity was found to increase by 22 % in D 2 O , by dynamic light scattering from polystyrene spheres of radius ∼ 60 nm , consistent with values found in literature [ 77 , 78 ] . Light scattering measurements of clathrin triskelia in both solvents were comparable once a correction was made in the DLS measure - ment for a diﬀerence in viscosity between the two solvents . Viscosity - corrected results of the light scattering measurements made on clathrin in both H 2 O and D 2 O buﬀers are shown in Table 4 . 1 . Clathrin Assembles Baskets in D 2 O In H 2 O ( and in 0 . 1 M MES buﬀer ) , clathrin triskelia will rapidly assemble below a pH of 6 . 5 [ 14 ] . In order to test whether clathrin will function in a D 2 O solvent , 76 Tab . 4 . 1 : Experimental Values of R H and R g of Clathrin in 0 . 5 M Tris in both H 2 O and D 2 O solvents .

The extent of basket assembly was monitored dynamically by DLS and by a ﬁnal pelleting assay in a Beckman ultracentrifuge [ 80 ] 24 hours after the initial addition of MES buﬀer ( the initiation of basket assembly ) . In order to capture the time dependence of the hydrodynamic radius of clathrin by DLS during assembly , it was necessary to reduce the correlation time from 2 minutes to 5 seconds . If the acquisition time was larger than this , the hydrodynamic radius was overestimated during periods of rapid basket assembly . This caused larger errors in estimation of the hydrodynamic radius , but allowed a rough characterization of size and fraction of polymerization . Both hydrodynamic radius and absolute inten - sity were monitored . The combination of the scattered light intensity along with the intensity correlation function showed deﬁnitively that clathrin triskelia maintained 77 Tab . 4 . 2 : Fraction of Clathrin in Pellet after 24 hours in H 2 O and D 2 O .

Scattered intensity and hydrodynamic radius vs . polymerization time are shown in Fig . 4 . 4 . After 24 hours each sample was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 15 minutes to es - timate the fraction of protein assembled into clathrin baskets . Polymerized fraction vs . pH is shown in Table 4 . 2 and Fig . 4 . 5 [ 80 ] . Clathrin baskets assembled faster in D 2 O buﬀer than in H 2 O buﬀer for a given measured pD ∗ value and pH . Clathrin could also assemble at higher pH values in D 2 O than in H 2 O buﬀers ( e . g . pH / D ∗ 6 . 5 ) . This is even more surprising , given the fact that the glass electrode meter measures a lower pD ∗ value than the actual pD , as mentioned in Section 4 . 2 ( e . g . pD ∗ = 6 . 5 → pD = 6 . 9 ) . This promotion of basket assembly by D 2 O is still not fully understood and is a topic of active research . 78 Fig . 4 . 4 : Light scattering measurements show clathrin assembles faster in D 2 O buﬀer than H 2 O buﬀer at pH and pD ∗ values of 6 . 0 and 6 . 2 . ( as measured by meter ) . Baskets do not assemble in D 2 O or H 2 O at pH or pD ∗ values of 6 . 5 and 7 . 2 . For comparison , clathrin basket assembly is shown in H 2 O at a pH value of 6 . 0 and 6 . 2 . All experiments were conducted at room temperature .

[ 80 ] 4 . 3 . 2 Neutron Scattering and Rigid Models SANS data were compared with theoretical curves based on rigid bead models of clathrin triskelia identical to those used to ﬁt experimental light scattering data from Chapter 3 . Calculations of the scattering function , P ( q ) , were made using Eq . 4 . 4 for bead models based on the 21 ˚A and 12 . 5 ˚A resolution cryo - EM structures of a clathrin triskelion when assembled into a D6 basket with AP2 [ 65 , 16 ] . As in Chapter 3 , for the highest resolution model ( PDB Code 1XI4 [ 16 ] ) , a bead of radius 3 . 6 ˚A was used to represent each amino acid residue resolved in the structure . Each bead is centered at the coordinates of the C α atom of the corresponding amino acid . [ 67 , 66 ] A lower resolution model used consisted of 52 beads . This model was used to estimate the aﬀect of changes in conformation of the triskelion ( see Fig . 3 . 6 ) on the calculated theoretical scattering function . The 16 beads in the leg of the low 80 resolution models have a radius of 15 ˚A , corresponding to about 12 kDa of protein or approximately 110 amino acid residues . The terminal domains are modeled as slightly larger beads , having a radius of 25 ˚A each . ( See Fig . 3 . 5 . ) A visualization of the models as well as results of the calculations can be seen in Fig . 4 . 6 and 4 . 7 , along with SANS data taken on clathrin triskelia in 0 . 5 M Tris at pH 7 . 0 in H 2 O . Two characteristic features are observed after applying Eq . 4 . 4 to these rigid bead models . They are a minimum and secondary maximum at q values just outside of the central Guinier regime . This dip occurs because of destructive interference of the scattered wave from scatterers in diﬀerent legs of the triskelion . It does not occur , for example , in calculations done on a single leg ( Shown in Fig . 4 . 8 ) , and seems to be sensitively dependent upon the relative distance and positions between the legs and the out of plane pucker of the triskelion . ( See Fig . 4 . 9 ) This feature seems to decrease in prominence as the molecular model is ﬂattened parametrically . A noteworthy observation from the SANS data in Fig . 4 . 6 and 4 . 7 is that this dip , calculated for the puckered triskelial models , does not exist as prominently in the experimental data . It occurs only as a shoulder or plateau just outside the low q , “Guinier regime . ” This leads us to speculate on the reasons for the discrepancy between experiment and our models . Another interesting feature of the experimental SANS data is the power law de - cay of the scattered intensity noted for large values of the magnitude of the scattering vector q . It falls oﬀ somewhere between the 1 / q behavior of a rigid rod model and the 1 / q 2 behavior of a random coil ( ∼ q − 1 . 23 in D 2 O ) . This can be seen in Fig . 4 . 6 where the solid black lines indicate the slopes . 81 Fig . 4 . 6 : SLS and SANS data and calculated scattering function of a cryo - EM model .

The inset shows the graph in a linear plot . The calculated scattering function , which is normalized to 1 , was multiplied by a factor of 0 . 63 cm − 1 in order to get best agreement with both SLS and SANS data . The solid black lines indicate the power laws 1 / q 2 and 1 / q as indicated corresponding to the large q scaling of a ﬂexible Gaussian chain model and a rigid rod respectively . 82 Fig . 4 . 7 : SLS and SANS data and calculated scattering function of rigid bead models of clathrin . ( Consult Fig . 4 . 6 . ) The dotted line shows a scattering function calculated using Eq . 4 . 4 for 4 models of a clathrin triskelion made up of 52 beads and shown above in ( a ) - ( d ) . These are the models that ﬁt the DLS and SLS measurements from Chapter 3 . The inset shows the graph in a linear plot . The calculated scattering function which is normalized to 1 was multiplied by a factor of 0 . 66 cm − 1 in order to get best agreement with both SLS and SANS data . 83 Fig . 4 . 8 : The calculated scattering function of triskelion leg ( upper curve ) and a complete triskelion with three tegs ( lower curve ) .

A surface plot showing changes in the calculated scattering function for a 52 bead triskelion model as the pucker angle , ψ , is varied from 90 ◦ to 30 ◦ and swivel angle , χ , is varied parametrically with the pucker angle according the the equation χ = 3 ( ψ − 30 ) / 2 . The leg bend angle is ﬁxed at φ = 120 ◦ . 85 4 . 3 . 3 Flexible Models For a completely ﬂexible model of a linear chain polymer , the scattering function is given by Eq . 4 . 3 . A ﬂexible model of a triskelion as a fully ﬂexible molecule of three connected linear chains takes into account interference between scatterers in diﬀerent chains as well as the same chain . The scattering function still falls of asymptotically as q − 2 at large q and is described by the following equation ( from Teraoka [ 81 ] ) : P 3 ( q ) = 6 R 4 g q 4 (cid:181) e − 13 R 2 g q 2 ( e − 13 R 2 g q 2 − 1 ) + 1 3 R 2 g q 2 (cid:182) ( 4 . 5 ) This ﬂexible model for a clathrin triskelion does not ﬁt SANS data at large values of q . This can be seen in ﬁts to SANS data from clathrin suspended in H 2 O buﬀer , Fig . 4 . 10 ( 0 . 5 M Tris pH 7 ) and more clearly in ﬁts to SANS data from clathrin suspended in D 2 O buﬀer , Fig . 4 . 11 ( 0 . 5 M Tris pH 7 ) where data could be taken at distances of 13 meters and 5 meters , measuring the scattering function out to q = 0 . 1 ˚ A − 1 4 . 3 . 4 Smearing Caused by a Wavelength Distribution In the NG3 - SANS instrument , neutrons from the cold source pass through a multidisk mechanical velocity selector with variable speed and pitch , enabling both the mean wavelength and wavelength resolution to be varied since the neutrons wave - length is determined by its velocity by the de Broglie relation : λ = hmv . In our experiments the mean wavelength of neutrons was 5 . 5 ˚A and the full width at half maximum was 0 . 8 ˚A . In the calculation of model scattering functions already presented , it is assumed that the incident and scattered wave vectors of interfering plane waves , (cid:126)k 0 and (cid:126)k s , have 86 Fig . 4 . 10 : SLS and SANS data in H 2 O buﬀer and ﬁt to ﬂexible three - armed star polymer model . ( Compare to Fig . 4 . 6 . ) The solid line shows a ﬁt to a calculated scat - tering function for a fully - ﬂexible three - armed star polymer ( Eq . 4 . 5 ) . Note the deviation of the model function at high values of q . 87 Fig . 4 . 11 : SLS and SANS data of clathrin in D 2 O buﬀer and ﬂexible three - armed star polymer model . SLS and SANS data of clathrin was taken in 0 . 5 M Tris D 2 O buﬀer . A constant background from D 2 O buﬀer was subtracted of ∼ 0 . 1 cm − 1 . The SLS data ( in counts per second ) were scaled to the SANS data . The solid line shows a ﬁt to a calculated scattering function for a fully - ﬂexible three - armed star polymer ( Eq . 4 . 5 ) . Note the deviation of the model function at high values of q . 88 a ﬁxed magnitude . If instead the incident beam has a wavelength dispersion , then the magnitude of the scattering vector ( q = 2 | (cid:126)k 0 | sin θ 2 = 4 πλ sin θ 2 ) will be described by a Gaussian distribution function , ρ ( q ) = 1 (cid:113) 2 πσ 2 q e − ( q − q 0 ) 2 2 σ 2 q , where q 0 is the average wavevector and σ q is width , and the actual scattering function will be averaged over the diﬀraction pattern from many wavelengths according to the following equation [ 31 ] : P ρ ( q | q 0 , σ q ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 ρ ( q (cid:48) ) P ( q (cid:48) ) dq (cid:48) = 1 (cid:113) 2 πσ 2 q (cid:90) ∞ 0 P ( q (cid:48) ) e − ( q − q 0 ) 2 2 σ 2 q dq (cid:48) . ( 4 . 6 ) This transformation was applied to the triskelion model function 1 for q 0 = 5 . 5 ˚A and σ q = 0 . 8 ˚A . The results may be seen in Fig . 4 . 12 . One can see from this calculation that smearing due to wavelength dispersion is insuﬃcient to explain disagreement between experiment and theory , in the case of rigid bead models shown in Fig . 4 . 6 and 4 . 7 . 4 . 4 Summary and Discussion The SANS experiments described in this chapter are consistent with all of the ﬁndings of the light scattering experiments of Chapter 3 . We can rule out a rigid pla - nar structure for the triskelion because it is not consistent with light scattering . The radius of gyration of such a structure is too large and does not ﬁt SANS measurements 1 Here I would like to thank and acknowledge S . Krueger , who kindly performed this calculation for me and produced this graph . 89 Fig . 4 . 12 : SANS data and smeared scattering function of a cryo - EM model . SANS data of clathrin in 0 . 5 M Tris in H 2 O . A constant background of H 2 O buﬀer was subtracted of ∼ 1 cm − 1 . The red line shows a scattering function calculated using Eq . 2 . 20 for the cryo - EM structure of Clathrin in a D6 basket . The blue line shows the scattering function smeared using Eq . 4 . 6 . The model and SANS data were normalized to 1 . 90 at small values of q , even though the model calculations might ﬁt at intermediate and large q . Neither will a fully ﬂexible Gaussian chain model adequately describe SANS measurements at large q . The most consistent models presented in this chapter are the rigid puckered bead models ( both from the cryo - EM model and the 52 bead models ) which ﬁt both DLS and SLS measurements . These models are also in good agreement with SANS measurements , except for the discrepancy at intermediate values of q . Inconsistencies between the rigid puckered models and SANS measurements may be due to ﬂexibility of the triskelion , since we have ruled out other possibilities such as smearing of the data from dispersion in neutron wavelengths ( see Fig . 4 . 12 ) and polydispersity by DLS measurements . Analysis of SANS data with a model triskelion in which ﬂexibility of the legs is taken into account will be discussed in the next chapter . Secondary ﬁndings from this study involve the eﬀect of a D 2 O solvent on clathrin basket assembly in MES buﬀer . By DLS and a pelleting assay , it was observed that D 2 O promoted basket assembly in two ways . It increased the rate of assembly at a measured pD ∗ equivalent to the pH in an H 2 O solvent ( see Fig . 4 . 4 ) , and increased the total amount of protein assembled after a period of 24 hours ( see Table 4 . 2 [ 80 ] ) . SANS measurements of clathrin baskets at pH 6 . 0 in D 2 O solvent seemed to agree well with calculations based on the D6 basket cryo - EM structure . SANS mea - surements of baskets formed in H 2 O at the same pH appeared larger ( data not shown ) and did not ﬁt the D6 basket structure . This is a subject of current study . The ﬁt of the rigid D6 basket model to SANS measurements of clathrin baskets in D 2 O is qualitatively similar to that seen in our study of single triskelia ( see Fig . 91 4 . 13 ) . This indicates that the D6 basket structure may be a good descriptor of clathrin baskets assembled in D 2 O and that clathrin baskets , too , may be ﬂexible . This also is a subject of continued research .

BROWNIAN DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF A BEAD - SPRING MODEL CLATHRIN TRISKELION 5 . 1 Introduction In order to investigate the possible eﬀects of thermal motions of triskelial legs on the shape of the scattering function , we constructed a discrete bead - spring model of a complete triskelion . We approximated intra - molecular forces on each subunit by linear springs . A similar bead - spring model was originally proposed by Harris and Hearst [ 82 ] to approximate semi - ﬂexible linear polymers and later studied by Marques et al . [ 73 ] . In their model bonds between molecular subunits have identical spring constants and bond angles are preserved by springs between next - nearest neighbors having a diﬀerent spring constant . Unlike the worm - like chain model of Kratky and Porod [ 31 ] , which uses a ﬁxed bond length , the Harris and Hearst model allows for bond length ﬂuctuations determined by the strength of the springs and the temperature of the reservoir . In our model , equilibrium bond lengths are determined from a structural model and bond length ﬂuctuations are suppressed by the use of stiﬀ springs . This will be discussed more thoroughly in Section 5 . 3 . The details of our model serve to preserve bond lengths ( through nearest neighbor springs ) and bond angles ( through next - nearest neighbor springs ) while allowing ﬂexibility of the triskelion legs . Bead 93 size and equilibrium conﬁgurations were chosen according to the models described in Chapter 3 , which were based on structural and light scattering measurements of clathrin triskelia ( see Fig . 3 . 5 ) . The models consistent with the measured R H and R g are shown in Fig . 3 . 10 a - d . We simulated dynamics of the triskelion model in a thermal bath by integrating a Langevin equation [ 83 ] of the form m i d 2 (cid:126)x i dt 2 = (cid:126) F i ( t ) + (cid:126)F i ( t ) , ( 5 . 1 ) where m i is the mass of a subunit i , (cid:126)x i is the subunit position , (cid:126) F i ( t ) is the total intramolecular force on a subunit i at time t and (cid:126) F i ( t ) is the random thermal force on the subunit from the surrounding ﬂuid . 5 . 2 Methods 5 . 2 . 1 Constructing a Bead - Spring Model of a Triskelion The mass of each subunit , m i = 4 π 3 ρa 3 i , was calculated using the density of ρ = 1 . 38 g / mL ( 0 . 831 Da / ˚A 3 ) consistent with experimental measurements of other proteins [ 84 ] . The radius of a subunit from the model was a i = 15 ˚A for legs and 25 ˚A for terminal domains . The mass of each subunit of the legs was approximately 12 kDa and the mass of each terminal domain was 54 kDa . This approximated the known molecular weight of a clathrin triskelion ( M w ∼ 651 kDa ) to within 13 % . The intramolecular force on each subunit , (cid:126) F i ( t ) was approximated by springs of strength k between two neighboring subunits and springs of strength αk between two next - nearest neighboring subunits . Each bead in the leg of a triskelion had , on 94 Fig . 5 . 1 : A sketch of the bead - spring model of a clathrin triskelion used in the Brownian dynamics simulation . a ) Connectivity of the vertex and legs of the triskelion model . Jagged lines represent springs between neighboring subunits and dotted lines indicate springs between non - neighboring subunits . b ) Torsional motion of the legs is partially prohibited by the addition of a single spring of strength k between each termial domain . This is shown schematically in ( c ) . c ) Connections between terminal domains in the triskelion model . These springs prevent the rotation of the legs about the vertex as indicated by ﬁgure above . Some axial rotation is still unconstrained about the axis deﬁned by the triskelion vertex and the end of the leg ( shown by arrow ) . Figure ( a ) is based on a scheme introduced in Marques et al . [ 73 ] 95 average , four springs connected to it . Each terminal subunit , where there is only one next - nearest neighbor , had two . The vertex where there were three nearest neighbors and three next nearest neighbors was connected to other subunits by six springs . This constrained the angles between each leg at the vertex . A schematic illustration of the connections used between subunits is shown in Fig . 5 . 1 . In order to constrain the legs of the triskelion from twisting , each of the ter - minal subunits was connected by a spring of strength k ( identical to the strength of springs between neighboring subinits in the legs ) . The legs , however , were left free to swivel about the axis deﬁned by the vertex and terminal domain of the leg ( see Fig . 5 . 1 ) . This swiveling could manifest itself in a long timescale oscillation in any shape dependent quantities calculated from the simulation . This motion could be constrained by the further addition of springs in the model , but this was not done in the calculations that are shown here . The springs constrain the motion of each subunit to ﬂuctuate about an equi - librium structure . (cid:126) F i ( t ) is a function of the coordinates of neighboring subunits and for typical subunits can be written explicitly as (cid:126) F i ( t ) = αk ( (cid:126)x i − 2 ( t ) − (cid:126)x i ( t ) − (cid:126)x i − 2 ( 0 ) + (cid:126)x i ( 0 ) ) + k ( (cid:126)x i − 1 ( t ) − (cid:126)x i ( t ) − (cid:126)x i − 1 ( 0 ) + (cid:126)x i ( 0 ) ) + k ( (cid:126)x i + 1 ( t ) − (cid:126)x i ( t ) − (cid:126)x i + 1 ( 0 ) + (cid:126)x i ( 0 ) ) + αk ( (cid:126)x i + 2 ( t ) − (cid:126)x i ( t ) − (cid:126)x i + 2 ( 0 ) + (cid:126)x i ( 0 ) ) ( 5 . 2 ) The initial position of each subunit , (cid:126)x i ( 0 ) , was chosen from the models shown in Fig . 3 . 10 . These are four rigid bead models that have the same hydrodynamic radius , 96 r H , and radius of gyration , r g , as those measured by light scattering experiments performed on clathrin triskelia in solution ( see Chapter 3 ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Estimating Model Parameters from Experimental Measurements of Clathrin Triskelia The leg length distribution [ 9 ] and the persistence length [ 10 ] of the legs of real clathrin triskelia have been estimated from the analysis of variations in electron mi - crographs of clathrin triskelia ﬂattened on a mica surface . These estimates for the elasticity of a triskelion leg will be used to choose the model parameters , k and α , of our bead - spring model of a triskelion . The Stretching Elasticity Estimated From a Distribution of Leg Lengths The variability in triskelion leg lengths observed in electron micrographs can give us an estimate of the longitudinal elasticity of a triskelion leg . In the study of Kocsis et al . [ 9 ] , 357 randomly chosen triskelion legs were digitized and digitally straightened . The resulting data showed a Gaussian distribution of leg lengths ( see Fig . 5 . 2 ) . The leg lengths , L , in the micrographs analyzed varied from 350 − 620 ˚ A with a mean of < L > = 516 ˚ A and a standard deviation of σ L = 43 ˚ A . In a continuous elastic medium , the force required to stretch an elastic material of cross sectional area , A , is related to the strain ∆ LL by the Young’s modulus , E of the material [ 85 ] , F = − EA ∆ L L ( 5 . 3 ) 97 Fig . 5 . 2 : Experimental variability in lengths of digitally straightened triskelion legs . ( Top ) Reconstructed images of digitally straightened triskelion legs . ( Bottom ) Histogram of leg lengths from 357 triskelion legs . The leg lengths in the micrographs analyzed varied from 350 − 620 ˚ A with a mean of < L > = 516 ˚ A and a standard deviation of σ L = (cid:112) < ( ∆ L ) 2 > = 43 ˚ A . Figures 2 and 3 from Kocsis et al . [ 9 ] 98 and the work , W , required to extend it is given by W = (cid:90) ∆ L 0 EA L xdx = 1 2 EA L ( ∆ L ) 2 . In equilibrium , the average energy stored in a ﬂuctuating leg can be related to the temperature by the equipartion theorem : < W > = 1 2 EA L < ( ∆ L ) 2 > = 1 2 k B T . This analysis gives us an estimate for the quantity EAL from the leg length distribution measured by Kocsis et al . , EA L = k B T < ( ∆ L ) 2 > ∼ 240 Da ˚ A 2 / ps 2 ( 43 ˚ A ) 2 ∼ 0 . 13 Da / ps 2 . ( 5 . 4 ) In a discrete system of masses connected by springs with equilibrium separation , b , and strength , k , the force related to an extension , δx , is given by F = − kδx = − kbδxb . By analogy to Eq . 5 . 3 , we can see that the quantity kb is the discrete analog to the continuous quantity EA . This allows us to estimate a value for k if the entire leg were made up of a single spring of equilibrium length b = L . k = EA L ∼ 0 . 13 Da / ps 2 . ( 5 . 5 ) Since each leg in our model consists of 18 subunits ( including the vertex and terminal domain ) and since each molecular subunit is connected to two springs on average , one to its neighbor of strength , k , and one to its next nearest neighbor of strength , αk , this network of springs results in a nontrivial relationship between the 99 model parameters k and α and the stretching elasticity of our bead - spring model . This relationship can be investigated by the analysis of the Brownian dynamics simulation and will be discussed more in Section 5 . 3 . The Bending Rigidity of a Triskelion Leg Estimated from an Experimental Distribution of Leg Shapes Fig . 5 . 3 : “Diagram of an elastic ﬁlament deﬁning the tangent vector in two dimensions . As the arc length increases , the tangent angles , θ ( s ) and θ ( 0 ) become uncorrelated . ” Figure and caption from Howard , 2001 [ 85 , Fig . 6 . 8 ] . Fluctuations in the shape of a linear ﬁlament can be characterized by a quantity called the persistence length , L p . The persistence length is a measure of the ﬂexibil - ity of a ﬁlament and can be determined experimentally from the spatial correlation function of the tangent vector , ˆ θ ( s ) , along the ﬁlament where s is the arc - length mea - sured along the ﬁlament ( ˆ θ and s are shown schematically in Fig . 5 . 3 ) . The spatial correlation function of the cosine between two tangent vectors , ˆ θ ( 0 ) and ˆ θ ( s ) , at a dis - 100 tance s from each other along the ﬁlament decays exponentially in three dimensions according to < ˆ θ ( s ) · ˆ θ ( 0 ) > = e − s / L p ( 5 . 6 ) where < · > denotes a time or ensemble average . Some examples of ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments of varying ﬂexibilities , rigid ( L p (cid:192) L ) , semiﬂexible ( L p ∼ L ) , and ﬂexible ( L p (cid:191) L ) , are shown in Fig . 5 . 4 . Fig . 5 . 4 : “Two snapshots of slender rods of length L bent by thermal forces . The more ﬂexible the rod ( the smaller the persistence length ) , the greater the curvature . ” Figure and caption from Howard , 2001 [ 85 , Fig . 6 . 7 ] In a continuous elastic medium of Young’s modulus , E , and cross sectional sec - ond moment , I = (cid:82) r 2 dA , the persistence length of an elastic ﬁlament can be related to the ﬂexural rigidity , EI , through the equipartition theorem . In two dimensions , the energy stored in the deformation of an elastic ﬁlament of length , L and the tangent 101 angle θ ( s ) = (cid:113) 2 L (cid:80) ∞ n = 0 a n cos (cid:179) nπxL (cid:180) is given by U = 1 2 EI ∞ (cid:88) n = 1 (cid:181) nπ L (cid:182) 2 ( a n − a 0 n ) 2 where a 0 n is the Fourier mode a n in the absence of forces [ 86 , 10 , 85 ] . In equilibrium the average energy stored in a Fourier mode , n , is 12 k B T : < U > = 1 2 EI (cid:181) nπ L (cid:182) 2 (cid:68) ( a n − a 0 n ) 2 (cid:69) = 1 2 k B T . The ﬂexural rigidity can be related to persistence length , L p , of a linear ﬁlament by L p = EI k B T . The shape ﬂuctuations in electron micrographs of triskelion legs can give us an estimate of the bending rigidity of a triskelion leg . In the study of Jin and Nossal [ 10 ] , 72 digitized electron micrographs of triskelion legs were analyzed to determine the bending rigidity of a triskelion leg . Some examples of these micrographs and digital triskelia are shown in Fig . 5 . 5 . Using this analysis , Jin and Nossal estimated the ﬂexural rigidity of a triskelion leg to be EI = 350 k B T ˚ A using the ﬁrst 5 Fourier modes . The analysis gives triskelion legs a persistence length of 350 ˚ A or ξ < L > = 350˚ A 516˚ A ∼ 23 where < L > is the average length of a triskelial leg . The persistence length , along with the estimate of stretching ﬂexibility , (cid:113) ( ∆ L ) 2 ∼ 43 ˚ A or √ ( ∆ L ) 2 < L > ∼ 43˚ A 516˚ A ∼ 0 . 08 , can be directly compared with calculations from the simulation of our bead - spring model of a triskelion to choose appropriate values of the model parameters k and α . Similar to the stretching elasticity , our bead - spring model , has a complex rela - tionship of the model parameters k and α to the persistence length . This dependence 102 Fig . 5 . 5 : “Experimental variability in shapes of triskelia on mica . ( Top ) Electron micro - graphs of triskelia on a mica surface . ( Bottom ) selected triskelion images , con - structed from corresponding digitized coordinates . ” The persistence length was estimated by normal mode analysis to be L p ∼ 350 ˚ A . Figure and Caption from Jin et al . [ 10 ] 103 will be investigated by analysis of results from the Brownian dynamics simulation and discussed more in Section 5 . 3 . 5 . 2 . 3 Taking into Account the Solvent The force on an intra - molecular subunit due to the solvent , F i ( t ) , in Eq . 5 . 1 may be split into a slowly varying frictional force proportional to the velocity of the subunit , ζ i d(cid:126)x i dt , and a rapidly varying force , F (cid:48) i ( t ) , that averages to zero m i d 2 (cid:126)x i dt 2 = (cid:126) F i ( t ) − ζ i d(cid:126)x i dt + (cid:126)F (cid:48) i ( t ) ; (cid:68) (cid:126)F (cid:48) i ( t ) (cid:69) = 0 , ( 5 . 7 ) where ζ i is the friction constant of a single subunit i . The friction constant on mole - cular subunits was approximated by Stokes’ law ζ i = 6 πηa i where η is the viscosity of the surrounding ﬂuid ( η Water = 0 . 01 P as = 602 Da ˚A ps ) and a i is the radius of the spherical subunit [ 87 ] . 5 . 2 . 4 Integrating the Equations of Motion New coordinates for each subunit of our molecule are determined by a simple Eulerian integration of Eq . 5 . 7 in the diﬀusive limit , where ζm ∆ t (cid:192) 1 and the inertial term , m i d 2 (cid:126)x i dt 2 , is small and can be ignored during integration [ 88 , 89 ] . Explicitly , each subunit position was evolved according to the algorithm x n + 1 = x n + ∆ t ζ F ( { x n } ) + X n ( 5 . 8 ) 104 where x n + 1 is the new subunit position , x n is the old subunit position , F ( { x n } ) is the total intramolecular force on a subunit at time step n , ∆ t is the time step and X n is a random displacement simulating thermal collisions with solvent molecules . 5 . 2 . 5 Approximating the Temperature For the random variable X n in Eq . 5 . 8 , a uniform random distribution , ρ ( X n ) , was used [ 88 , 90 ] . The variance in X n determines the temperature of the solvent in the simulation . Explicitly , X n is chosen from a uniform distrubution between ±√ 6 D i ∆ t , where D i = k B T ζ i is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the subunit i in the absence of other subunits . This gives the second moment of X n a value of 2 D i ∆ t , shown below . < X 2 n > = (cid:82) a − a ρ ( X n ) X 2 n dX n (cid:82) a − a ρ ( X n ) dX n = 1 3 a 2 = 2 k B T ζ i ∆ t = 2 D i ∆ t where , ρ ( X n ) = 1 , | X n | < a = 0 , o therwise . We ignored hydrodynamic interactions between subunits in order to facilitate the simulation . Incorporating hydrodynamic interactions between molecular subunits in the dynamical simulation would have the aﬀect of reducing the friction coeﬃcient on each subunit by hydrodynamic shielding from other parts of the molecule . There - fore any diﬀusion coeﬃcient calculated from the mean squared displacement of the molecule in the simulation would be too large . Structural dependent quantities cal - culated from the simulation might also be aﬀected . 105 We are interested in ﬂuctuations in the shape of the triskelion molecule . Since we are underestimating the frictional coeﬃcients of the subunits , we should consider that the conformational ﬂuctuations calculated from these simulations may be overly dampened . Since the simulations are performed in the Brownian dynamics limit , the friction coeﬃcient scales out of the equation and may only eﬀect the time scales of conformational ﬂuctuations and not the overall magnitude of ﬂuctuation . The most signiﬁcant aﬀect of hydrodynamic interactions may be the coupling and consequent correlation of the subunit positions that occur because of this term . The eﬀect of hydrodynamic interactions on Brownian dynamics and other stochastic simulations is discussed thoroughly by McCammon et al . [ 91 ] and Pastor et al . [ 89 , 87 ] . Choosing a Timestep ( Estimating Numerical Error ) The numerical integration of Eq . 5 . 7 has an error associated with it that is dependent upon the time step ∆ t used in Eq . 5 . 8 . We can evaluate this error for the simple case of a particle in a harmonic potential of strength k and a thermal reservoir at temperature T [ 87 ] . The mean squared displacement < x 2 > is given by k B Tk . Squaring Eq . 5 . 8 and taking the time average , denoted by (cid:104)·(cid:105) we get < x 2 n + 1 > = (cid:42)(cid:195) x n − k ∆ t ζ x n + X n (cid:33) 2 (cid:43) = (cid:195) 1 − k ∆ t ζ (cid:33) 2 (cid:68) x 2 n (cid:69) + (cid:195) 1 − k ∆ t ζ (cid:33) (cid:104) x n X n (cid:105) + (cid:68) X 2 n (cid:69) . We now assume that < x 2 n + 1 > = < x 2 n > and (cid:104) x n X n (cid:105) = 0 , 0 = − 2 k ∆ t ζ (cid:195) 1 − k ∆ t 2 ζ (cid:33) (cid:68) x 2 n (cid:69) + 2 k B T ζ ∆ t , (cid:68) x 2 n (cid:69) = k B T k 1 1 − (cid:178) ; (cid:178) = k ∆ t 2 ζ . ( 5 . 9 ) 106 The time step , ∆ t , was chosen such that the numerical error , (cid:178) , in (cid:104) x 2 n (cid:105) of the strongest spring used in the simulation , k , was 5 % , or explicitly that ∆ t = 110 ζk . Checking the Bead - Spring Model In order to be certain that the forces were implemented correctly , the intramole - cular force , F ( { x n } ) was checked for energy conservation using the Verlet algorithm . This is a well known molecular dynamics algorithm used to integrate the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems [ 92 , 87 ] . The Verlet algorithm has no dissipative or friction term and is not connected to a thermal bath . Explicitly , the new positions determined by the Verlet algorithm are calculated from previous ones according to x n + 1 = 2 x n − x n − 1 + ∆ t m F ( { x n } ) Subunits were initialized with a random velocity chosen from a uniform distri - bution between ± (cid:113) 3 k B T m i , our approximation of a Boltzman distribution . The energy as a function of time is shown is Fig . 5 . 6 . While the total energy ﬂuctuates about an average value , determined by initial velocities of each subunit , the average total energy remains constant over both short ( ns ) and long timescales ( µs ) . The Computation of Time Averages from Dynamic Simulations In order to determine how long to run the simulation for computation of a meaningful time average of dynamic quantities in the simulation , the timescales re - lated to internal modes of oscillation of the bead - spring model can be estimated and any time average should be computed using a simulation that is run for intervals that are longer than this timescale . 107 Fig . 5 . 6 : Energy conservation of a molecular dynamics simulation of a triskelion . This ﬁgure shows average total energy , kinetic energy and potential energy per subunit per k B T vs . simulation time for a triskelion model using the molecular dynamics Verlet algorithm . The initial velocities of subunits were chosen randomly from the interval { − (cid:113) 3 k B T m i , + (cid:113) 3 k B T m i } . Subunits were started in thier equilibrium positions , so the total initial potential energy is zero . In this example the model parameters were k = 100 Da / ps 2 and α = 10 . The timestep was 0 . 705 ps . Snapshots were taken at 2 . 1 ns intervals . 108 Since we are interested in computing a time averaged scattering function , we will concentrate on ﬂuctuations in the radius of gyration which is loosely related to the width of the central peak in the scattering function . The radius of gyration can be deﬁned as the second moment of the mass distribution in a molecule . If ρ ( (cid:126)r ) is the mass ( or scattering ) distribution of a molecule , r g can be calculated for a bead - spring model according to the equation r g = (cid:90) V d(cid:126)r | (cid:126)r | 2 ρ ( (cid:126)r ) If the molecule is modeled as a discrete set of spherical subunits where (cid:126)r i is a subunit position with respect to the center of mass , a i is the subunit radius , and v i = 4 π 3 a 3 i is a subunit volume , r g can be calculated according to the simple sum r g = 1 N (cid:80) Ni = 1 v i | (cid:126)x i | 2 (cid:80) Ni = 1 v i The time dependent radius of gyration , r g ( t ) = r g ( { (cid:126)x i ( t ) , a i } ) of the bead - spring triskelion model can be considered a dynamic variable and is a function of the bead coordinates and radii . The temporal autocorrelation function of the instantaneous radius of gyration can tell us something about the timescales with which the model conformation , and therefore the scattering function , is ﬂuctuating . In the Brownian dynamics simulation , r g if found to ﬂuctuate about an average value ( < r g > − r g 0 ) r g 0 = 5 % − 18 % below the value of the r g for the rigid model , r g 0 and approaches the value , r g 0 as the spring strength is increased ( in the rigid model limit ) . The RMS ﬂuctuation in the r g is on the order of 10 ˚A and is a weak function of spring strengths , k , and αk . The time averaged quantities < r g > and σ r g for a few diﬀerent spring strengths are shown in Fig . 5 . 8 . 109 The temporal autocorrelation function of r g , denoted δr g = r g ( t ) − < r g > was calculated by the following equation , < δr g ( τ ) δr g ( 0 ) > < δr 2 g > = 1 T (cid:82) T 0 δr g ( t + τ ) δr g ( t ) dt 1 T (cid:82) T 0 δr g ( t ) 2 dt ∼ e − τ / τ c and had an initial , rapid exponential decay in delay time , τ c , between 5 and 13 µs , for diﬀerent spring strengths , k . A few correlation functions are shown in Fig . 5 . 7 along with their exponential ﬁts . Fig . 5 . 7 : The temporal autocorrelation function of r g decays with a timescale on the order of 10 µs . The correlation time showed some sensitivity to the spring strength , k , of the triskelion model but did not seem to be sensitively dependent on the model parameter α . Brownian Dynamics Simulations were run for a duration of ∼ 700 µs . 500 snapshots were taken at 1 . 4 µs intervals . 110 Fig . 5 . 8 : Variation of average radius of gyration , < r g > and standard deviation σ r g = (cid:113) < ( δr g ) 2 > with spring strength , k . ( Top ) variation in the time average of the r g with spring constant , k . The symbols show time averages from simulation for two diﬀerent values of bond angle spring strength parameter , α . The dotted line shows the r g of the rigid model , r g 0 = 235 ˚ A , for the model calculated . ( Rigid model is shown in Fig . 3 . 10a . ) The time average , < r g > , approaches this value as the spring strength , k is increased . ( Bottom ) the standard deviation of r g , denoted σ r g vs . the spring strength , k . The standard deviation , σ r g , should approach 0 in the rigid model limit , but may have a ﬁxed value due to swivel motion of the legs as previously discussed in Section 5 . 2 ( shown schematically by the arrow in Fig . 5 . 1 c ) . 111 5 . 3 Results The Brownian dynamics simulation was run for several diﬀerent values of k and α at a temperature of 20 ◦ C for a total duration of 700 µs . Computation time varied with time step which in turn was dependent upon the strongest spring in the simulation ( αk ) and the desired degree of accuracy ( (cid:178) = αk ∆ t 2 ζ = 5 % ) . 500 snapshots of the conﬁguration of each molecule were recorded durring the simulation . For a given set of spring strengths , k and αk , the leg extension ﬂexibility of the bead - spring model was determined by the explicit calculation of temporal ﬂuctuations in leg lengths during the simulation . Triskelial leg length ﬂuctuations were dependent on the spring constants used , but were less than 1 % of the total leg length for the parameter range that was simulated . The persistence length of the triskelion legs , L p , was also found to be dependent on the spring constants used in the simulation . This parameter was determined by calculation of the spatial correlation function of the directional tangent vector cosine according to Eq . 5 . 6 . The tangent vector cosine was calculated , as a function of arc - length s , with respect to a tangent vector deﬁned between the vertex and the ﬁrst subunit of each individual triskelion leg . Examples of the calculated spatial correlation functions for four diﬀerent sets of spring constants are shown in Fig . 5 . 9 on a semi - logarithmic plot . One can clearly see the straight line in these semi - logarithmic plots indicating exponential decay in the correlation function . By the diﬀerence in the slopes of the data one can also see the dependence of the persistence length on the spring constant , k , and its independence of the parameter α for the two values 112 studied . Once calculated , the correlation functions were ﬁt to an exponential curve with the decay length ( the inverse slope of the straight line ) giving a measure of the persistence length , L p . The persistence length varied between 200 and 1000 ˚A for the range of model parameters studied . This can be compared with the experimentally estimated value of L p = 350 ˚Awhich was discussed in Section 5 . 2 . 2 and determined by the analysis if electron micrographs ( see Fig . 5 . 5 ) . Fig . 5 . 9 : The time average of directional correlation of tangent vectors , < cos ( ∆ θ ) > = < ∆ (cid:126)x ( 0 ) · ∆ (cid:126)x ( s ) | ∆ (cid:126)x ( 0 ) | | ∆ (cid:126)x ( s ) | > , between subunits in a Brownian dynamics simulation of a bead - spring model of a clathrin triskelion shows decay with position , s . This decay deﬁnes a persistence length , L p , of the simulated triskelion leg . Symbols show time averages from the simulations . The dotted lines show exponential ﬁts to simulations for α = 10 . ∆ θ is the angle between tangent vectors , ∆ (cid:126)x , at position at leg position the vertex , 0 , and at position , s . 113 In Fig . 5 . 10 the calculated persistence length of the simulation is plotted as a function of spring strength , k , for two diﬀerent values of the model parameter α . The persistence length has an inverse square root dependence on the spring strength , k , as shown by the dotted line ﬁt . The experimentally estimated value of the persistence length is shown by the dark black line drawn at a value of 350 ˚A . This corresponds to a Brownian dynamics simulation with a spring constant of k ≈ 200 Da ps − 2 , which has not been performed to date . The persistence length seems to be independent of α for the two values simulated . Snapshots from the simulation were used to calculate a series of instantaneous scattering functions using Eq . 2 . 20 . For each simulation , these functions were calcu - lated and then averaged over time to produce an average scattering function which can then be compared with experimental measurements . Four average calculated scatter - ing functions with diﬀerent triskelion ﬂexibilities can be seen in Fig . 5 . 11 along with SLS and SANS data taken on clathrin triskelia in 0 . 5M Tris at pH 7 . 0 in H 2 O . The time averaged scattering function agrees with experimental SANS data from isolated clathrin triskelia in solution for high , low and intermediate q - values where the rigid model was insuﬃcient ( see Fig . 4 . 6 and 4 . 7 ) . This shows that , while rigid modeling was suﬃcient to explain average properties such as translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the radius of gyration ( see Chapter 3 ) , more information is included in the complete scattering function . Extra information is contained in the SANS data , and the measurements allow us to say something about the molecular ﬂexibility and dynamics of isolated triskelia . As the rigidity of the bead - spring model is decreased , the dip and subsequent 114 Fig . 5 . 10 : The persistence length , L p , depends upon the spring strength , k in a Brownian dynamics simulation of a bead - spring model performed at room temperature . Symbols show persistence lengths derived from the simulations . The dotted line shows a ﬁt to the symbols for α = 10 . The inset shows L p vs . frequency of oscillation of a spring for a typical leg subunit of mass , 12 kDa . L p is a linear function of the frequency of oscillation , ω . 115 peak in the scattering function at intermediate q - values is smoothed out . The dip and peak in the time averaged scattering function becomes lower in amplitude eventually becoming only a shoulder - like feature . It should be noted that this shoulder occurs at the same value of q in which a shoulder is seen in the experimental data . If the ﬂexibility of the model is increased even more , then the feature at intermediate values of q disappears . This very ﬂexible model does not qualitatively agree with either the experimental SLS and SANS data . In Fig . 5 . 12 , the same four time - averaged scattering functions with diﬀerent model ﬂexibilities are shown along with SLS and SANS data taken on clathrin triskelia in 0 . 5M Tris at pH 7 . 0 in D 2 O . ( A diﬀerent experiment than shown in Fig . 5 . 11 ) This experiment gives a higher contrast between solute and solvent , allowing measurement of the scattering function to higher q - values at a detector distance of 5 meters as well as 13 meters . In this ﬁgure agreement between SANS data and the ﬂexible model can be seen over the entire q - range measured which extends over two and a half orders of magnitude . 5 . 4 Summary and Discussion By SANS , we have conﬁrmed previous estimates of triskelion structure in so - lution as well as estimates of triskelion leg ﬂexibility . We have shown that isolated clathrin triskelia have a puckered structure on average but undergo large ﬂuctuations about this average puckered shape . The measured SANS scattering function suggests that clathrin triskelia have a considerable amount of ﬂexibility when free in solution . The ﬂexibility of triskelion legs may be important in describing clathrin assem - 116 Fig . 5 . 11 : SLS and SANS data and calculated scattering function of ﬂexible bead - spring models of a clathrin triskelion . SLS and SANS data of clathrin in 0 . 5 M Tris in H 2 O . A constant background of H 2 O buﬀer was subtracted of ∼ 1 cm − 1 . The SLS data ( in counts per second ) were scaled to the SANS data . The line show time - averaged scattering functions calculated using Eq . 2 . 19 , for four models of a clathrin triskelion made up of 52 beads . These are the models that ﬁt the DLS and SLS measurements from Chapter 3 . The time averages were calculated based on the Brownian dynamics simulation described in Section 5 . The simulations were performed in water (cid:181) η = 602 Da ˚A ps (cid:182) at a temperature of 20 ◦ C . The mass density used was 0 . 831 Da ˚A 3 . The spring constants used were k = 50 , 100 and 200 Da / ps 2 . The factor α was 10 . The time averaged scattering function which is normalized to 1 was multiplied by a factor of 0 . 8 cm − 1 in order to get best agreement with both SLS and SANS data . A residual background of 0 . 015 cm − 1 was also added to the calculated scattering functions . 117 Fig . 5 . 12 : SLS and SANS data of clathrin in D 2 O and calculated scattering function of ﬂexible bead models of clathrin . SLS and SANS data of clathrin in 0 . 5 M Tris in D 2 O . A constant background of ∼ 0 . 1 cm − 1 , ascribed to the D 2 O buﬀer , was subtracted . The SLS data ( in counts per second ) was scaled to the SANS data . Similar to Fig . 5 . 11 , the lines show time averaged scattering functions calculated using Eq . 2 . 19 for four models of a clathrin triskelion made up of 52 beads . The data shown were taken as described in Chapter 4 . 118 bly in many respects . It could be that triskelial ﬂexibility is stabilized once positioned in a clathrin lattice . This would explain why structures can be determined by cryo - EM tomography and single particle analysis when these techniques are used to study a complete clathrin lattice but are not able to be rendered for isolated triskelia . If this were the case it would imply an entropic loss during clathrin lattice assembly , which may be important in basket size determination and basket stability . 6 . SUMMARY , DISCUSSION , AND FUTURE WORK 6 . 1 Summary Early studies by Kirchhausen et al . involved the analysis of TEM micrographs of clathrin triskelia deposited on mica surfaces . The triskelia tended to show a deﬁnite clockwise or counterclockwise bend in the three legs that depended on the buﬀer that was used for deposition [ 17 ] . It was argued that the diﬀerent buﬀers modiﬁed the interactions between triskelion molecules an the mica surface , thus diﬀerentially depositing the triskelia “right side up” or “upside down . ” This was also conﬁrmed by the measurement of average distances between terminal domains in the micrographs . The distance between terminal domains was larger for the “upside down” triskelia than for “right side up” triskelia . This was the ﬁrst evidence that clathrin triskelia had an intrinsic , three dimensional pucker in solution . A schematic illustration from this study is shown in Figure 6 . 1 . Later TEM studies by Kocsis et al . [ 9 ] used digitization and particle averaging of triskelia deposited on mica to determine a leg length distribution as well as the average dimensions of diﬀerent leg segments and an average two dimensional projec - tion of the shape of single triskelia . Later analysis of these micrographs by Jin and Nossal [ 10 ] indicated that triskelion legs were ﬂexible with a persistence length of 350 120 Fig . 6 . 1 : “Schematic representation of the adsorption of clathrin to mica . Puckered clathrin triskelia are shown approaching a mica surface from their concave ( top ) or convex sides ( middle ) . The bottom diagram provides top and side views of a triskelion , showing the consequence of adsorption to mica . The dotted line illustrates the outcome of the internal collapse that would result from a three - point landing . This collapse would probably include a ”screwing” motion that would increase the observed bends of the proximal / distal hinges . ” ( Figure and Caption adapted from Reference [ 17 ] ) 121 ˚A , approximately 23 the length of the leg . This was done by ﬁtting normal mode amplitudes ( or spatial Fourier coeﬃcients ) to the equipartition theorem as described in Section 5 . 2 . 2 The combination of light scattering and SANS experiments described in this dissertation is consistent with previous work . They conﬁrm both the interpretations and the conclusions of previous measurements . In the analysis of the shapes of triske - lia adsorbed to carbon ﬁlms or mica surfaces , details about triskelial structure and ﬂexibility when they are in solution are inferred . However , since light scattering and neutron scattering measurements are performed while the triskelia are free in solution , they are direct , noninvasive , and nonperturbative . The earliest analytical models of macromolecules required either complete ﬂex - ibility , in the case of Gaussian chain polymeric models , or complete rigidity , in the case of the spherical , rod like , or ellipsoidal models . Models for semiﬂexible chains have been investigated such as the Kratky and Porod chain [ 31 ] and the early Harris and Hearst models [ 82 ] . These models have been compared with polymers and other linear molecules using light scattering , neutron scattering , and other experimental techniques . More recently , the dynamical properties of molecules of more complex shape than a linear chain have been investigated combining structural information and bead - spring models by normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics simulations . In this study , we have examined a unique macromolecule that simultaneously exhibits a complicated average structure but has ﬂexibility about that structure . Clathrin triskelia have not one single conformation but have many diﬀerent conformations in solution . Light scattering measurements described in this dissertation show that the 122 clathrin triskelion has a puckered structure . SANS measurements demonstrate that dynamics are present in solution . This may indicate that both play a role in the assembly and disassembly of the clathrin coat during function in eukaryotic cells . 6 . 2 Discussion There is a growing understanding of proteins that do not have a single confor - mation but can ( must ) assume many diﬀerent shapes . It is clear that , in order to understand the relationship between a protein structure and its function , as we are trying to do for the clathrin triskelion , the unconstrained degrees of freedom ( ﬂexibil - ity and hinges , etc . ) must be determined as well . These may be even more important than the constrained degrees of freedom that relate to a low energy static structure consistent with the folded ground state of a known polypeptide sequence ( the protein folding problem ) . Some examples may be seen in recent work describing the mechan - ics of the ribosome [ 93 ] , the molecular motor kinesin [ 94 ] , and ATP synthase [ 95 ] . Analysis techniques , such as the one used here , that can extract information about protein conformational dynamics from established measurement techniques such as small angle scattering ( light , neutron or X - ray ) , TEM particle averaging , and cryo - EM single particle analysis , may complement newer , single molecule tech - niques used in AFM pulling experiments , optical trapping experiments , and forrester resonance energy tranfer ( FRET ) . In some cases macroscopic scattering techniques may be easier to apply to the system under consideration . They may also be be less 123 invasive than AFM or optical tweezers , and do not require ﬂuorescent labeling as in the case of FRET . 6 . 3 Future Work We have constructed a dynamic structural model for a single clathrin triskelion to explain experimental SANS data taken from single triskelia . ( See Figure 5 . 11 ) This was done because the rigid models did not ﬁt our experimental data at intermediate values of q . Similar techniques could be used to ﬁt SANS data from clathrin baskets assembled at low pH . Both the data and model are shown in Figure 4 . 13 . Utilization of a dynamic model could give us an estimate for the ﬂexibility of the clathrin cage , which has been estimated but not measured [ 10 ] . The stiﬀness of a clathrin coated vesicle ( diﬀerent from the bare , reconstituted cage ) has been recently measured by AFM to be 20 times stiﬀer than the estimate for a basket [ 96 ] . It would be interesting to directly determine the ﬂexibility of the clathrin basket for comparison with this measurement . Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in understanding the mechanisms of assembly / disassembly of the clathrin lattice . Cryo - EM tomography has played a central role in this research . It has been used to visualize position and arrangement of subunits , adaptors , and chaperone proteins within the lattice ( see Figure 6 . 2 ) . In the presence of adaptor protein AP2 , clathrin triskelia will assem - ble into cages of 6 - 2 - 2 symmetry . In 1999 , this structure was resolved by Musacchio et al . [ 65 ] using cryo - EM tomography at a high enough resolution to distinguish in - 124 dividual heavy chains within the clathrin lattice . This structure , when combined with X - ray structures of crystallized clathrin fragments , produced a high resolution model of the triskelion lattice . As resolution has improved , cryo - EM tomography has conﬁrmed the positions of the light chains along the heavy chain ( Figure 6 . 2a ) and de - termined the eﬀect of the chaperone Hsp70 and cochaperone auxilin on cage structure and regions of localization within the coat ( shown in Figure 6 . 2 c , d [ 16 , 97 , 98 ] ) . These structures illustrate the role of each subunit in the clathrin machinery , shedding light on the mechanisms of clathrin recruitment and disassembly during endocytosis and answering questions that cannot be addressed easily by the use of X - ray diﬀraction or other techniques .

B ) An 8 - ˚A re - construction of a clathrin basket with individual clathrin heavy chains highlighted in red , green , and yellow . ” ( A and B Figure and Caption from Reference [ 16 ] ) C ) “A 12 - ˚A reconstruction of a clathrin basket formed in the presence of a 39 - kDa fragment of auxilin ( purple ) . ” ( Figure and Caption from Reference [ 97 ] ) D ) “A 23 - ˚Areconstruction of a clathrin basket prepared in the presence of Hsc70 ( blue ) . ” ( Figure and Caption from Reference [ 98 ] ) 125 Recently it was shown by Heymann et al . [ 98 ] that an uncoating protein , Hsp70 , localizes to the polyhedral surface of an assembled clathrin basket . This protein is colored in purple in the electron density map from cryo - EM tomography shown in Figure 6 . 2 d . When triskelial dynamics and thermal ﬂuctuations , which we have shown to be considerable , are taken into account , one can see that a slight modi - ﬁcation of the equilibrium shape of a triskelion within a cage assembly ( Figure 6 . 2 b ) due to the presence of Hsp70 ( or an auxilin - Hsp70 complex ) might be suﬃcient to thermodynamically destabilize the basket , as is seen in vitro [ 15 ] . In a simulation , this mechanism for cage destabilization could be tested by shortening the equilibrium distances of springs between terminal domains of triskelia , thus altering the natural pucker of each triskelion within the lattice . It has been noted that in the presence of the Hsp70 chaperone makes the 6 - 2 - 2 basket more rounded in shape , while the presence of the auxilin co - chaperone causes the structure to have a more barrel - like shape in 3D cryo - EM reconstructions . These structural changes could easily be conﬁrmed by further SANS experiments . BIBLIOGRAPHY [ 1 ] B . Alberts , D . Bray , A . Johnson , J . Lewis , M . Raﬀ , K . Roberts , and P . Walter .
