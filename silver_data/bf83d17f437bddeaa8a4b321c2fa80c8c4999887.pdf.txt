Springer , March 30 , 2016 ( sent for review March 21 , 2016 ; reviewed by Michael L . Dustin and Kenneth M . Yamada ) Whether β 1 integrin ectodomains visit conformational states sim - ilarly to β 2 and β 3 integrins has not been characterized . Further - more , despite a wealth of activating and inhibitory antibodies to β 1 integrins , the conformational states that these antibodies sta - bilize , and the relation of these conformations to function , remain incompletely characterized . Using negative - stain electron microscopy , we show that the integrin α 5 β 1 ectodomain adopts extended - closed and extended - open conformations as well as a bent conformation . Antibodies SNAKA51 , 8E3 , N29 , and 9EG7 bind to different domains in the α 5 or β 1 legs , activate , and stabilize extended ectodomain conformations . Antibodies 12G10 and HUTS - 4 bind to the β 1 β I do - main and hybrid domains , respectively , activate , and stabilize the open headpiece conformation . Antibody TS2 / 16 binds a similar epi - tope as 12G10 , activates , and appears to stabilize an open β I domain conformation without requiring extension or hybrid domain swing - out . mAb13 and SG / 19 bind to the β I domain and β I – hybrid domain interface , respectively , inhibit , and stabilize the closed conformation of the headpiece . The effects of the antibodies on cell adhesion to fibronectin substrates suggest that the extended - open conformation of α 5 β 1 is adhesive and that the extended - closed and bent - closed conformations are nonadhesive . The functional effects and binding sites of antibodies and fibronectin were consistent with their ability in binding to α 5 β 1 on cell surfaces to cross - enhance or inhibit one another by competitive or noncompetitive ( allosteric ) mechanisms . I ntegrins comprise a family of 24 adhesion receptors that trans - mit bidirectional signals across the cell membrane ( 1 ) . Integrin α - and β - subunits are both type I transmembrane glycopro - teins , with a large N - terminal extracellular domain , a single - span transmembrane domain , and usually a short C - terminal cytoplasmic domain . β 2 and β 3 integrins adopt three global con - formational states : bent - closed , extended - closed , and extended - open ( Fig . 1 A ) ( 2 – 10 ) . With β 2 and β 3 integrins , high concentrations of ligands induce the extended - open conformation of intact integrin and ectodomain preparations — and the open conformation of headpiece preparations — showing that the open conformation has higher affinity than closed conformations ( 7 , 10 – 12 ) . Electron microscopy ( EM ) studies and cell - surface affinity measurements with α X β 2 and α L β 2 integrins and conformation - specific Fabs show that the bent - closed and extended - closed conformations have low affinity for ligand whereas the extended - open conformation has high affinity for ligand ( 8 , 9 , 13 ) . We know less about β 1 integrin conformational states . The β 1 subunit associates with 12 integrin α - subunits , including those that contain or lack α I domains , to form by far the largest and most diverse integrin subfamily . β 1 integrins recognize ligands including collagens , laminins , ligands with Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) motifs in - cluding fibronectin , and Ig superfamily members including cell - adhesion molecules ( 1 ) . Cells localized in tissues basally adhere through β 1 integrins to the extracellular matrix . In contrast , β 2 and β 3 integrins are commonly expressed on cells that circulate in the bloodstream in a state in which these integrins are nonadhesive . Only upon cellular activation in the bloodstream do β 2 integrins on leukocytes or β 3 integrins on platelets become active and bind their ligands ( 1 ) . A common discussion point among integrin biologists is the concept that β 1 integrins may be regulated differently from β 2 and β 3 integrins . One proposal is that β 1 integrins may not have a bent conformation and may be constitutively extended . Small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) and EM studies on the α 5 β 1 headpiece have shown that it can adopt a closed conformation with the hybrid domain swung in , and an open conformation with the hybrid domain swung out ( 11 , 14 , 15 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . However , whether β 1 integrins have both bent and extended conformations like β 2 and β 3 integrins and the specific conformational states of the β 1 integrin ectodomain that correspond to active and inactive states remains elusive . A large number of activating and inhibitory antibodies are main - stays in the β 1 integrin field ( 14 , 16 – 22 ) . Some have been surmised to be specific for conformational states , particularly of α 5 β 1 , by indirect means such as their ability to alter ligand binding coupled with mutagenesis interpreted with respect to the integrin α V β 3 structure ( 20 , 23 , 24 ) . However , the lack of evidence that α 5 β 1 has a bent conformation and paucity of structural information on β 1 integrin complexes with antibodies have limited our ability to define the structural basis of β 1 integrin biology . Among such antibodies , only SG / 19 has been structurally characterized , and its EM and crystal structures are limited to headpiece complexes . These have shown that whereas binding of fibronectin fragments and RGD peptides stabilizes the open conformation of the α 5 β 1 headpiece , binding of this inhibitory Fab stabilizes the closed head - piece conformation ( 11 , 14 , 25 ) . Here we characterize the conformational states that are ac - cessible to integrin α 5 β 1 in the absence and presence of α 5 β 1 Fabs , and the role of these states in α 5 β 1 - mediated adhesiveness Significance β 1 integrins form the largest and most diverse integrin subfamily , with 12 distinct αβ heterodimers . Together , the seven other integrin β - subunits form an equal number of 12 heterodimers . Despite speculation that different integrin subfamilies may differ in activation mechanism or conformation , we show that α 5 β 1 , similar to β 2 and β 3 integrins , can adopt the bent - closed , extended - closed , and extended - open overall global conforma - tional states . We characterize nine function - perturbing antibodies for the subunit and domain they bind and the conformation they stabilize . Only the extended - open α 5 β 1 conformation mediates adhesion to fibronectin . Our results enable many cell biological studies on the 12 β 1 integrins to be interpreted in terms of the integrin conformational states on cell surfaces that are stabilized .

By comparing nine function - perturb - ing Fabs for their binding sites on specific integrin domains and the conformational states they stabilize , we enable a large number of previous cell biological studies on the 12 β 1 integrins to be interpreted in terms of the integrin conformational states on cell surfaces that were stabilized . We demonstrate that acti - vating β 1 mAb can perturb the conformational equilibrium either by stabilizing extension or headpiece opening , that α 5 β 1 can adopt a bent conformation , and that the extended - open and not the bent - closed or extended - closed conformations of α 5 β 1 medi - ates adhesion to fibronectin . Results EM , Integrin α 5 β 1 , and Fibronectin . The α 5 β 1 ectodomain was expressed in mammalian cells using a clasped protein construct ( Fig . 1 B ) in which ACID and BASE coiled - coils provide the close association between the α - and β - subunit ectodomain C termini provided in intact cells by the associating transmembrane domains ( 4 , 6 – 9 , 26 ) . Purified clasped α 5 β 1 was incubated with or without Fab or a fi - bronectin fragment with Fn3 domains 7 – 10 ( Fn3 7 – 10 ) and sub - jected to gel filtration ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . Peak fractions were immediately adsorbed to electrostatically charged ( glow - discharged ) carbon grids , negatively stained ( and fixed ) with uranyl formate , and subjected to EM . Over 5 , 000 particles were picked from images ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 ) and subjected to alignment , classification , and averaging using two different algorithms ( Methods ) . Representative classes with good structural detail ( see below ) and all class averages ( SI Appendix , Figs . S2 – S14 ) are shown . The α 5 β 1 ectodomain adsorbed onto EM grids in side and en face orientations ( Fig . 2 A and B , respectively ) . The α - and β - legs lie together in side views and cannot be distinguished . Side - view particles are V - shaped and comprise a globular end containing the headpiece and a lower leg , each ∼ 100 Å long ( Fig . 2 A ) . These sum to ∼ 200 Å , very similar to the 190 – 200 Å that en face , extended particles span ( Fig . 2 B ) . Side - view α 5 β 1 particles were present in a range of head - to - tail distances from 110 to 200 Å ( Fig . 2 A and C ) . Most had head - to - tail distances of 135 – 150 Å ( Fig . 2 A , panels 2 and 3 and Fig . 2 C ) and an appearance that closely resembled compact , bent particles of four other integrins ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) ( Fig . 2 D ) . Although other integrins including α IIb β 3 show a range of V angles in the bent conformation ( 4 ) , the angle is on average greater in α 5 β 1 . En face α 5 β 1 was clearly extended ( Fig . 2 B ) . Although some side - view particles were extended ( Fig . 2 A , panel 5 ) , there was little overlap in head - to - tail distance between side - view and en face particles ( Fig . 2 C ) , suggesting that most side - view α 5 β 1 particles are bent ( Fig . 2 A , panels 1 – 4 ) .

PNAS | Published online June 17 , 2016 | E3873 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S head of the α - subunit β - propeller domain than the β - subunit β I domain . Thus , the α - subunit β - propeller domain and upper leg lie to the left in Fig . 2 B ( Right ; schematics ) . The α - and β - legs tended to cross below the knees . The α - leg has larger domains than the β - leg and was often resolved to its last domain , calf - 2 , whereas the β - leg is flexible and was often “ averaged out ” or faint in class averages ( Fig . 2 B ) . These leg properties resemble those of other integrins ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) . En face α 5 β 1 predominantly exhibited the closed conformation of the headpiece ; the head - piece moiety cross - correlated better with 2D projections from closed headpiece than open headpiece crystal structures ( Fig . 2 B , Lower and Methods ) . α 5 β 1 ectodomain complexes with Fn3 7 – 10 exclusively exhibi - ted en face views and the extended open conformation ( Fig . 2 E ) ; the headpiece region best - correlated with 2D projections from open headpiece integrin crystal structures ( Fig . 2 E , Lower ) . In the open conformation , the hybrid domain swings out . This ap - pears to result in slightly but consistently lower head - to - tail dis - tances ( Fig . 2 E ) than for extended - closed particles ( Fig . 2 B ) , as the legs adopt a more curved conformation to meet at the clasp ( even though the clasp , along with the lower β - leg , is not visible ) . Fn3 7 – 10 bound to an interface formed by the α 5 β - propeller and β 1 β I domain . Fn3 7 – 10 adopted an extended conformation and had a length of ∼ 145 Å , as seen in its crystal structure ( 27 ) . Four individual Fn3 modules were moderately resolved as globules ; these globules and their equal lengths allowed their positions to be deduced ( yellow rules , Fig . 2 E ) . Fn3 domains 9 and 10 , known to be sufficient for binding ( 28 ) , each bound the integrin . Fn3 do - main 10 with its RGD largely laid over the β I domain , whereas domain 9 with its synergy site appeared to partially contact the β - propeller domain and partially extend beyond it ( 11 , 15 ) . Fn3 domains 7 and 8 , although not essential for binding , were helpful for visualizing and orienting the ligand in EM . Fabs That Stabilize Extension . Four activating Fabs , 9EG7 , 8E3 , N29 , and SNAKA51 , all stabilized extension and yielded side or en face views of the α 5 β 1 ectodomain with similar head - to - tail lengths of 180 – 200 Å ( Fig . 3 ) . The great majority of en face views had the closed conformation , as shown by better correlation of their headpiece moieties with the closed conformation ( Fig . 3 ) , whereas a small minority of class averages , at least for two of the Fabs , displayed the open headpiece ( Fig . 3 A and B , Right ) . 8E3 and N29 Fabs bound to the lower portion of the upper β - leg ( Fig . 3 B and C ) , confirming previous mapping to the plexin – semaphorin – integrin ( PSI ) domain ( 20 ) . 9EG7 bound to the upper portion of the lower β - leg . Individual integrin - epidermal growth factor ( I - EGF ) domains were not resolved ; therefore , 9EG7 - binding po - sition was measured as % of head - to - tail distance in EM . Com - parison with distances in extended integrin ectodomain models ( 4 ) suggested that 9EG7 bound to I - EGF2 , in agreement with aboli - tion of the epitope by a D522E mutation in I - EGF2 ( 19 , 29 ) . SNAKA51 bound to the lower α 5 leg at the interface between the calf - 1 and calf - 2 domains ( Fig . 3 D ) , in agreement with the suffi - ciency of a fragment containing both the calf - 1 and calf - 2 domains , but not either domain alone , for SNAKA51 binding ( 30 ) . Fabs That Stabilize the Open Headpiece . The activating antibodies 12G10 and HUTS - 4 stabilized the open α 5 β 1 headpiece , as shown by EM ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . All class averages of the α 5 β 1 – 12G10 complex showed the en face view of α 5 β 1 in the extended - open conformation with 12G10 bound to the outer side of the β I domain ( Fig . 4 A ) , consistent with epitope mapping . HUTS - 4 and α 5 β 1 did not form a stable complex that can be purified by gel filtration ; the elution peak coincided with that of α 5 β 1 alone ( Fig . 1 C ) . However , it formed a stable ternary complex with α 5 β 1 and 12G10 , consistent with selection of HUTS - 4 for recognition of activated integrin ( 16 ) . Class averages of the ternary complex all showed the en face view of α 5 β 1 in the extended - open confor - mation ( Fig . 4 B ) . HUTS - 4 bound to the hybrid domain and laid between the α 5 and β 1 subunits ( Fig . 4 B ) , consistent with in - clusion in the epitope of β 1 residues 355 – 425 ( 16 ) . TS2 / 16 is an unusual activating antibody that may stabilize an open conformation of the β I domain while favoring but not re - quiring the hybrid domain to swing out or the integrin to extend .

A few class aver - ages showed a view with the head – Fab complex on the grid and the legs missing and perhaps farther from the grid and thus not well - stained ( Fig . 4 C , panels 6 and 7 ) . En face views were absent , and thus none of the class averages with TS2 / 16 alone defined whether the headpiece was open or closed . Ternary complexes of α 5 β 1 with TS2 / 16 and the extension - specific Fab 9EG7 yielded orientations on the grid with little overlap with TS2 / 16 – α 5 β 1 class averages ( SI Appendix , Figs . S10 and S11 ) even though 9EG7 Fab was not visualized in most ternary class averages ( Fig . 4 D and SI Appendix , Fig . S11 ) . In contrast to TS2 / 16 – α 5 β 1 com - plexes , en face views were predominant in TS2 / 16 – 9EG7 – α 5 β 1 complexes . The best - resolved and most - populated en face class averages clearly showed the extended - open conformation of α 5 β 1 ( Fig . 4 D ) and all class averages appeared to have the extended - open conformation , particularly when prepared with iterative stable alignment and clustering ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 B ) ; however , we could not rule out the presence of a minority of extended - closed class averages ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 ) . The en face class averages showed that TS2 / 16 bound to the β I domain ( Fig . 4 D ) , consistent with its localization in side - view complexes ( Fig . 4 C ) and epitope mapping ( 14 , 31 ) . Saturation of α 5 β 1 with TS2 / 16 , 12G10 , or HUTS - 4 Fabs induces indistinguishable high affinity for cyclic RGD peptide . These results and more described below suggest that TS2 / 16 induces the open conformation of the β I do - main but binds in such a way that β I domain opening ( confor - mational change in ligand - binding regions ) favors but does not require hybrid domain swing - out , namely headpiece opening as visualized in EM ( Fig . 4 C ) . Fabs That Stabilize the Closed Headpiece . Complexes with inhibitory Fabs SG / 19 and mAb13 showed α 5 β 1 in the bent or extended - closed conformation ( Fig . 5 ) . The α 5 β 1 – SG / 19 complex was mostly in the en face orientation , showing a fully extended ectodomain with closed headpiece ( Fig . 5 A , panels 1 – 3 ) . SG / 19 bound at the interface between the β I and hybrid domains , consistent with EM and crystal structures ( 14 , 25 ) . Some class averages also showed SG / 19 Fab bound to the compact , bent conformation of α 5 β 1 ( Fig . 5 A , panels 4 and 5 ) . We made a model of an SG / 19 Fab – α 5 β 1 ectodomain complex by superimposing α 5 β 1 headpiece – SG / 19 Fab complex and α V β 3 ectodomain crystal structures ( 6 , 25 ) . The ectodomain – SG / 19 Fab complex model cross - correlated well with class averages ( Fig . 5 A , panels 4 and 5 , Lower and Right ) , pro - viding support for a compact , bent α 5 β 1 ectodomain conformation similar to that of α V β 3 . mAb13 clearly bound to the head of α 5 β 1 , but class averages tended not to show the legs ( Fig . 5 B ) . Many class averages showed the head – Fab bound to the grid with the legs perhaps farther from the grid ( Fig . 5 B , panels 1 – 3 ) , as shown for some TS2 / 16 com - plexes ( Fig . 4 C , panels 6 – 7 ) . Some mAb13 complex class averages showed an en face view consistent with the closed headpiece ( Fig . 5 B , panels 4 and 5 ) . Ternary complexes with 9EG7 yielded more en face views with the α 5 β 1 ectodomain clearly in the extended - closed conformation and with mAb13 bound to the β I domain ( Fig . 5 C ) , consistent with epitope mapping ( 31 ) . Functional Effects and Compatibility Between Fabs . Fab cross - competition experiments corroborated conformational specifici - ties of Fabs and examined competition among them for binding sites ( Fig . 6 ) . K562 cells , which abundantly express α 5 β 1 , were pretreated with high concentrations of one Fab or Fn3 9 – 10 as “ effector ” or “ competitor ” in the absence ( Fig . 6 A – I ) or presence of high concentrations of Fn3 9 – 10 as a second effector ( Fig . 6 J – O ) , and then labeled with a lower concentration of Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled second Fab or Fn3 9 – 10 . Subsequent fluorescence flow cytometry was performed in the absence of washing to avoid removal of the effectors / competitors . Results are informed by findings that on K562 cells , α 5 β 1 is > 99 % bent - closed ; that once extended , the extended - open conformation is more stable than the extended - closed conformation ; and that Fn3 9 – 10 binds much more strongly to the extended - open than bent - or extended - closed conformations . Self - competition results were consistent with the predominance of the bent conformation of α 5 β 1 on K562 cells . The two Fabs specific for the closed conformation , SG / 19 and mAb13 , each showed robust self - competition in the absence of Fn3 9 – 10 ( Fig . 6 G and H ) . Among extension - specific and open - specific Fabs , HUTS - 4 , 12G10 , 8E3 , 9EG7 , and SNAKA51 showed binding augmented by Fn3 9 – 10 and good self - competition in the presence of Fn3 9 – 10 ( Fig . 6 K – O ) but less or no self - competition in the absence of Fn3 9 – 10 ( Fig . 6 B – F ) , consistent with the importance of Fn3 9 – 10 augmentation . In agreement with its ability to stabilize β I domain opening without requiring extension or hybrid domain swing - out , TS2 / 16 showed good self - competition in the absence of Fn3 9 – 10 ( Fig . 6 I ) and bound better basally to α 5 β 1 than other A α 5 β 1 + 12G10 185 Å 1 186 Å 2 161 Å 3 open0 . 929 open0 . 917 open0 . 908 C α 5 β 1 + TS2 / 16 D α 5 β 1 + TS2 / 16 + 9EG7 187 Å 1 188 Å 2 open0 . 864 open0 . 838 TS2 / 16 118 Å 1 134 Å 2 192 Å 5 149 Å 3 158 Å 4 112 Å 6 111 Å 7 B α 5 β 1 + HUTS - 4 + 12G10 188 Å 1 181 Å 2 167 Å 3 open0 . 928 open0 . 890 open0 . 833 12G10 HUTS - 4 Fig . 4 .

Among effectors that stabilize the open headpiece , synergy was seen among all three , Fn3 9 – 10 , HUTS - 4 , and 12G10 ( Fig . 6 A – C ) . This is consistent with binding to three nonoverlapping sites on the α 5 β 1 headpiece in EM ( Figs . 2 E and 4 A and B ) . Moreover , the open headpiece - specific effector Fn3 9 – 10 also enhanced TS2 / 16 binding , consistent with TS2 / 16 specificity for the open conformation of the β I domain ( Fig . 6 I ) . Among ef - fectors that induce extension , synergy was seen among 8E3 , 9EG7 , and SNAKA51 , and also with Fn3 9 – 10 ( Fig . 6 A and D – F ) . Synergy was also seen between effectors that stabilized headpiece opening and extension . Open headpiece - specific Fab 12G10 stabilized binding of extension - specific Fabs 8E3 , 9EG7 , and SNAKA51 ( Fig . 6 D – F ) . In contrast , the weaker , opening - reporting ( 16 ) Fab HUTS - 4 more modestly stabilized binding of SNAKA51 and 9EG7 and lacked effect on 8E3 ( Fig . 6 D – F ) .

Fabs that destabilized conformations recognized by other mAbs also showed competition . Thus , extension - specific Fabs SNAKA51 , 9EG7 , and 8E3 and open headpiece - specific Fab HUTS - 4 all inhibited mAb13 and SG / 19 binding ( Fig . 6 G and H ) . Competition was also evident among Fabs that bind to over - lapping epitopes ; many of the open headpiece - specific and closed headpiece - specific Fabs compete by binding to overlapping epi - topes on the β I domain in addition to binding to alternative conformations . The activating Fabs TS2 / 16 and 12G10 and in - hibitory Fab mAb13 were raised in mice or rats against human β 1 integrins . These and many other β 1 integrin function - modulating antibodies are specific for human residues at positions 207 , 208 , 211 , and 218 in the β I domain ; indeed , introduction of these four human residues into the chicken β 1 integrin subunit is sufficient for epitope reconstitution ( 14 , 31 , 32 ) . Thus , cross - blocking of activating TS2 / 16 and 12G10 and closed headpiece - specific mAb13 Fabs ( Fig . 6 C , H – J , and L ) is explicable by binding to this epitope . Fab SG / 19 binds to an epitope that includes residues 151 , 154 , and 155 at the C - terminal end of the α 1 - helix , which are immediately adjacent to residues 207 – 211 at the beginning of the α 2 - helix in the β I domain . The close spatial proximity of the SG / 19 and mAb13 epitopes is consistent with their cross - blocking ( Fig . 6 G and H ) ( 14 ) , and similar proximity of the SG / 19 epitope to the TS2 / 16 and 12G10 epitopes likely explains cross - blocking among these Fabs ( Fig . 6 C , G , and I ) . When TS2 / 16 prebinding stabilized the open β I domain conformation it competed with SG / 19 binding ( Fig . 6 G ) , whereas when SG / 19 prebinding stabilized the closed conformation it failed to compete with TS2 / 16 binding ( Fig . 6 I ) . This lack of reciprocity might mean that the epitopes recognized by these two Fabs overlap in the open β I domain but not the closed β I domain conformation . In the presence of Fn3 9 – 10 , open headpiece - specific Fab HUTS - 4 and extension - specific Fab 8E3 cross - competed with one another ( Fig . 6 K and M ) . These Fabs bind to the hybrid and PSI domains , respectively , which are adjacent in the upper β - leg , and simultaneous Fab binding might be forbidden by steric overlap . Fab HUTS - 4 also competed with SNAKA51 in the presence of Fn3 9 – 10 ( Fig . 6 K and O ) . Although these Fabs bind to different domains in different integrin subunits , when bound to β 1 , HUTS - 4 Fab extends toward α 5 ( Fig . 4 B ) and might sterically overlap with SNAKA51 Fab in the extended - open conformation . The functional relevance of the three conformational states of α 5 β 1 was characterized by measuring the effect of Fabs on ad - hesion of K562 cells to substrates precoated with Fn3 7 – 10 or plasma fibronectin . Basal binding to the two substrates by K562 cells was low in Mg 2 + / Ca 2 + and much greater in Mn 2 + ( Fig . 7 ) . Extension - specific Fabs 8E3 , 9EG7 , N29 , and SNAKA51 ; open headpiece - specific Fabs 12G10 and HUTS - 4 ; and open β I domain - specific Fab TS2 / 16 all enhanced adhesion strongly . Closed headpiece - specific Fabs SG / 19 and mAb13 completely suppressed activation by Mn 2 + ( Fig . 7 ) . To address the mechanism of activation by extension - specific Fabs , we used combinations of extension - specific and closed headpiece - specific Fabs that showed no interference with one another in cross - competition assays ( Fig . 6 and Table 1 ) , SNAKA51 plus SG / 19 and 9EG7 plus mAb13 ( Fig . 7 ) . In each case , the closed headpiece - specific Fab completely suppressed the acti - vating effect of the extension - specific Fab , demonstrating that α 5 β 1 ectodomain extension alone is not sufficient for adhesion and that the open headpiece conformation is required . In con - trast , combinations of extension - specific and open headpiece - specific Fabs were activating . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the bent - closed and extended - closed states of integrin α 5 β 1 are nonadhesive , whereas the extended - open conformation is highly adhesive . Furthermore , the low basal adhe - siveness of K562 cells suggests the presence of little extended - open α 5 β 1 on the cell surface . Discussion Our major finding is that integrin α 5 β 1 has three conformational states including a bent - closed state .

Su et al . PNAS | Published online June 17 , 2016 | E3877 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S and the extended - open state is adhesive on K562 cells . Basally , K562 cells are nonadhesive . These results correlate with our EM observations that α 5 β 1 ectodomain preparations pre - dominantly populate the bent - closed conformation and that complex formation with Fn3 9 – 10 induces the extended - open conformation . By defining which of the three conformational states of α 5 β 1 that nine different function - perturbing antibodies stabilize ( Table 1 ) , we enable extensive structure – function correlations . Previously , many of these antibodies have been inferred to be conformation - specific by their effects on ligand binding , mapping to regions known to shift conformation in other integrins , effects of conformation - constraining disulfide bonds , and reference to conformations defined in other integ - rins ( 16 , 20 , 29 ) . Such methods have been used to show that α 5 β 1 can be stabilized in a bent conformation with a disulfide bond introduced between the calf - 2 and β - tail domains and is extended and active in focal contacts but bent in other locations on the cell surface ; however , functional differences between extended - closed and extended - open conformations were not resolved ( 29 ) . Although previous studies have been helpful , the paucity of information on conformational change in β 1 integrins compared with β 2 and β 3 integrins has been emphasized even by laboratories that have made leading contributions to charac - terizing β 1 integrin antibodies ( 22 , 29 ) . The β 1 integrin subfamily has many more distinct αβ hetero - dimers ( 12 ) than the β 2 ( 4 ) or β 3 ( 2 ) integrin subfamilies . Work with β 1 integrins has shown heterogeneity in their ability to be activated and has suggested subunit - dependent differences among integrins ( 19 ) . Furthermore , it has been proposed that there are only two types of integrin activation - dependent anti - bodies , ( i ) ligand - mimetic antibodies and ( ii ) cation and ligand - induced binding - site antibodies ( 33 ) . Our findings show that the latter consist of distinct groups , those ( i ) that stabilize the ex - tended conformation and ( ii ) that stabilize the open conforma - tion — of the β I domain only or of both the β I and hybrid domains . Despite speculation that different subfamilies of integrins may differ in activation mechanism or conformation , the three overall global conformational states of α 5 β 1 seen here with EM — bent - closed , extended - closed , and extended - open — are similar to those of α V β 3 , α IIb β 3 , α X β 2 , and α L β 2 ( 4 , 7 – 9 ) . Characterization of function - perturbing β 3 integrin antibodies in EM is limited ( 34 ) , and the extended - open conformation has been induced by ligand binding ( 7 , 10 , 12 ) rather than correlated with function using antibodies as done here for α 5 β 1 . The ex - tended - open conformation has been shown to be the only ad - hesive and high - affinity conformation of β 2 integrins using sets of Fabs analogous to those used here ( 9 , 13 ) ; however , the corre - lation is less direct than demonstrated here because β 2 integrins bind ligand through an α I domain inserted into their α - subunits . α I domain conformation cannot be visualized in EM , and con - formational change must be transmitted to the α I domain from the β I domain in the headpiece . Despite global similarities among the three overall confor - mational states possessed by β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 integrins , there are notable differences among these integrins in their behavior in negative - stain EM and among the antibodies that define β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 integrin conformational states . The strength of negative - stain EM is that particles become oriented ; certain orientations selectively adsorb to the negatively charged carbon grid ( perhaps those that present larger areas for adsorption ) , and this limited set of orientations makes it easier to distinguish alternative conformations from alternative orientations ( in projection av - erages ) than in vitreous ice with cryo - EM , where orientation is usually random ( 35 ) . However , in contrast to α V β 3 , α IIb β 3 , and α X β 2 , which when extended largely adsorbed in en face views , α 5 β 1 largely adsorbed in side views [ similar to α L β 2 ( 8 ) ] , in which the α - and β - subunits and their conformations were difficult to distinguish . Perhaps related to this difference in adsorption , or perhaps because the compact form of the bent conformation is less stable in α 5 β 1 than in these other integrins , it exhibited a wide range of bending angles , ranging from a compact con - formation resembling the compact , bent conformations of α V β 3 , α IIb β 3 , α X β 2 , and α L β 2 ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) to fully extended . A large number of EM grids and Fab complexes were examined for α 5 β 1 and each was subjected to two independent methods of particle classification and averaging that gave similar results ( SI Appendix , Figs . S2 – S14 ) . The conclusion that α 5 β 1 exists in a bent conformation is also supported by class averages of SG / 19 Fab – ectodomain complexes that show a compact , bent conformation similar to that of the α V β 3 ectodomain modeled bound to SG / 19 Fab . How do the Fabs studied here stabilize particular conforma - tional states ? Models of the bent conformation of α 5 β 1 made using bent conformations of α V β 3 and α IIb β 3 suggest that exten - sion - specific Fabs bind to epitopes that are buried in headpiece – tailpiece or α - leg – β - leg interfaces in the bent conformation . Integrins are likely to equilibrate rapidly among their confor - mational states ; extension - specific Fabs would bind when the integrin was extended , and then trap ( stabilize ) it in that state . 9EG7 recognizes a single species - specific difference in the β 1 I - EGF2 domain , Asp - 522 in human and mouse , which is Glu in rat ( 29 ) . The equivalent residue in the bent conformation of α IIb β 3 is surrounded and protected from Fab by the α - subunit thigh and calf - 1 domains and β - subunit PSI and I - EGF1 domains ( Fig . 1 A ) ( 4 ) . These domains move away from I - EGF2 during extension and thus permit 9EG7 binding . Extension - specific KIM127 Fab to β 2 integrins similarly binds to I - EGF2 ( 8 ) . 8E3 and N29 Fabs bind to the PSI domain . The bend at the β - knee between the upper and lower β - legs places the PSI domain between I - EGF1 in the upper leg and I - EGF2 and I - EGF3 in the lower leg . Leg extension removes the proximity of I - EGF2 and I - EGF3 to PSI , and thus permits binding of antibodies specific for the extended conformation to PSI ( Fig . 1 A ) . SNAKA51 binds to the interface between the calf - 1 and calf - 2 domains in the lower α - leg , near both the lower β - leg and the headpiece in the bent conformation . Thus , SNAKA51 is predicted to bind to a site that is exposed in the extended but not bent conformations . Fabs that stabilize the closed headpiece bind to regions of the closed headpiece that differ in conformation from the open headpiece . SG / 19 recognizes a single species - specific residue , Thr - 82 , in a hybrid domain loop that only becomes ordered when bound to SG / 19 ( Fig . 8 A ) ( 25 , 36 ) . SG / 19 simultaneously recognizes human – mouse invariant residues at the end of the α 1 - helix in the β I domain , and thus recognizes an orientation between the hybrid and β I domains present only in the closed conformation . Similarly , 7E4 binds to hybrid domain residue V385 in this interface and stabilizes the closed conformation of this interface in β 2 integrins ( Fig . 8 A ) ( 9 ) . The β 1 subunit is unusually conserved between mouse and hu - man among integrins , and many function - perturbing antibodies recognize species - specific differences at β I domain α 2 - helix resi - dues 207 , 208 , 211 , and 218 ( 14 , 31 , 32 ) ; however , the α 2 - helix moves little in integrin allostery ( Fig . 8 ) . Instead , the α 2 - helix neighbors the α 1 - helix , which in turn neighbors the α 7 - helix . Movements of the α 1 - and α 7 - helices transmit conformational change in the β I domain between its ligand - binding site and in - terface with the hybrid domain ( Fig . 8 ) ( 12 ) . α 1 - Helix side chains form important coordinations to the metal ion dependent adhe - sion site ( MIDAS ) and adjacent to MIDAS ( ADMIDAS ) metal ions that alter in the high - affinity state , and pistoning of the β I domain α 7 - helix C terminus toward the hybrid domain causes pivoting at the N - terminal connection of the β I domain to the hybrid domain . In other words , headpiece opening comes about because the β I domain is inserted into the hybrid domain , and pistoning at one of the two connections between these domains causes pivoting at the other . E3878 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1605074113 Su et al . At the adjacent α 7 - , α 1 - , and α 2 - helices in open and closed β 3 structures , backbone C α atoms differ 4 . 7 – 9 Å at the α 7 - helix , 4 – 6 . 5 Å at the α 1 - helix , and only 0 . 7 – 2 . 7 Å at the equivalents of residues 207 , 208 , 211 , and 218 in the α 2 - helix ( 12 ) ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , the closed headpiece - specific Fab mAb13 and the open head - piece - specific Fabs 12G10 and TS2 / 16 likely become conforma - tion - specific by recognizing not only species - specific residues in the α 2 - helix but also conformation - specific locations of residues in the adjacent α 1 - helix . Among these three Fabs , the en face views with 12G10 suggest it binds more toward the α 1 - helix because it projects from the side of the headpiece similarly to SG / 19 , which binds the α 1 - helix , whereas the lack of clear views of the main plane of the headpiece with mAb13 and TS2 / 16 suggests they interfere with the binding of the main plane of the headpiece to the grid by projecting more orthogonally and binding more toward the α 3 - helix ( see species - specific residue locations in Fig . 8 ) . HUTS - 4 binds to the inner , α - subunit proximal face of the hy - brid domain and stabilizes its open conformation . β I domain in - sertion splits the hybrid domain into N - and C - terminal portions ( colored blue and red , respectively , in Fig . 8 ) . The C - terminal sequence forms the inner , α - subunit proximal half of the hybrid domain , consistent with mapping of the species specificity of HUTS - 4 to this segment ( 16 ) . In the closed conformation , this face of the hybrid domain contacts a long β - ribbon in the β - pro - peller W5 β 2 - β 3 loop ( Fig . 8 A ) , explaining why HUTS - 4 is specific for the open conformation . MEM148 to β 2 integrins recognizes the P374S substitution in the C - terminal segment of the hybrid domain ( Fig . 8 B ) to similarly stabilize the open conformation ( 9 ) . In the high - affinity conformational state of α 5 β 1 , the ligand - binding site at the β - propeller and β I domain interface is nor - mally linked through α 7 - helix motion to headpiece opening , visualized in EM by hybrid domain swing - out , as shown here with Fn3 7 – 10 and Fabs 12G10 and HUTS - 4 bound to the ectodo - main . TS2 / 16 appears not to require hybrid domain swing - out , but nonetheless appears to favor hybrid domain swing - out . In EM , TS2 / 16 – α 5 β 1 complexes resembled those of α 5 β 1 alone . Most ternary complexes of TS2 / 16 and α 5 β 1 with the extension - stabilizing Fab 9EG7 showed en face views with the open headpiece , although we could not rule out the presence of a minority of closed headpieces ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 ) , in contrast to 9EG7 complexes with α 5 β 1 alone , in which the closed head - piece predominated . Immunofluorescence flow cytometry showed cooperation between Fn and TS2 / 16 binding ; however , cooper - ation with HUTS - 4 or extension - stabilizing Fabs was not seen , again suggesting that TS2 / 16 does not require hybrid domain swing - out . Linkage of Fn3 7 – 10 and 12G10 but not TS2 / 16 binding to headpiece opening also correlates with regulation by divalent cations of their binding ( 20 ) . Saturation binding of TS2 / 16 , 12G10 , and HUTS - 4 Fabs induces nearly identical intrinsic , high affinities for cyclic RGD peptide , suggesting they stabilize identical confor - mations of the ligand - binding site in the β I domain . These findings suggest that TS2 / 16 might enable a “ cocked ” conformation of the β I domain in which the α 1 - helix moves , enabling high - affinity ligand binding , despite the absence of movement or alteration of α 7 - helix movement from the pathway it normally takes in headpiece opening . A cocked conformation was seen in a crystal structure of α X β 2 in which the “ internal li - gand ” of the α I domain bound to the β I domain MIDAS and relayed allostery between the α I and β I domains , despite the absence of α 7 - helix motion and presence of a bent - closed ectodomain conformation ( 37 ) , as seen here in EM with bound TS2 / 16 . In each case , the cocked conformation may represent a metastable intermediate , namely , in energy landscape parlance , a local energy minimum lying between two global , lower - energy minima representing the open and closed headpiece conforma - tions . In this scenario , TS2 / 16 would be able to bind both the cocked and open conformations but not the closed conforma - tion . A cocked conformation , with the β I domain open around the ligand - binding site but the hybrid domain not swung out , may be on the pathway between the closed and open conformations . However , this cocked conformation is not seen under physiologic ligand - binding conditions , because all class averages with Fn3 7 – 10 had extended - open conformations ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . The results with TS2 / 16 force us to distinguish between β I domain opening and headpiece opening . We cannot visualize β I domain opening by negative - stain EM . Usually β I domain opening is linked to headpiece movement by C - terminal pistoning of the β I domain α 7 - helix , which forces the hybrid domain to pivot about its other connection to the β I domain and to swing out , which is readily ap - parent in EM as the “ open headpiece . ” When α 5 β 1 is extended , TS2 / 16 complexes exhibit the open headpiece conformation . Thus , TS2 / 16 stabilizes the open conformation of the β I domain and is distinct from Fabs that bind to the β I domain and stabilize the closed con - formation of the β I domain such as mAb13 , which show the ex - tended - closed conformation in en face views . Evolution has resulted in great variation in the types of con - formation - specific , species - specific antibodies that are available for different integrin β - subunits .

PNAS | Published online June 17 , 2016 | E3879 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S have essentially invariant sequences in mammals and vertebrates , respectively , whereas in integrin β 2 the α 1 - and α 7 - helices each have two mouse – human differences that elicit conformation - spe - cific antibodies ( Fig . 8 ) ( 38 , 39 ) . Antibodies to these epitopes not only directly bind the elements that communicate allostery between the β I domain and headpiece but also project from the side of the headpiece ( 9 ) , making recognition of headpiece conformation in EM easier with β 2 than β 1 integrins . The integrin β 3 subunit also has little variation in α 1 - and α 7 - helix sequence in mammals , except near the MIDAS , where antibodies would likely block the ligand - binding site and therefore not be allosteric . There are currently no known open headpiece - specific or closed headpiece - specific allosteric antibodies to β 3 integrins ; β 3 integrin ligand - induced binding - site antibodies appear to be extension - specific ( 34 ) . In summary , we have shown that integrin α 5 β 1 possesses at least three distinct global conformational states . We have defined the states stabilized by nine function - perturbing antibodies widely used in the β 1 integrin field . Basally under conditions in which the bent - closed conformation likely predominates , α 5 β 1 on K562 cells is not adhesive for fibronectin . With Fabs to stabilize extension and the closed or open states of the β I domain and the headpiece , we demonstrated that the extended - open conformation and not the extended - closed conformation of α 5 β 1 on K562 cells is adhe - sive for fibronectin . Among the remaining important questions is how β 1 integrins with different α - subunits differ in the set points for their conformational equilibria on cell surfaces ( 19 ) . Methods Integrin α 5 β 1 Glycoprotein . DNA constructs were exactly as described pre - viously , except for replacement of α X and β 2 with α 5 and β 1 , respectively ( 8 ) . The α 5 ectodomain with signal peptide and residues F1 – Y954 with a C - ter - minal tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease site , acidic coiled - coil with a cysteine for disulfide - bond formation , and Strep II tag was inserted into the XbaI and AgeI sites of pcDNA3 . 1 / Hygro ( − ) . The β 1 ectodomain cDNA with signal peptide and mature residues Q1 – D708 with a C - terminal TEV site , basic coiled - coil with a cysteine , and hexahistidine tag was subcloned into BamHI and XbaI sites of pEF1 - puro . Stable HEK293S GnTI − / − transfectants were se - lected . Purification was as for the α 5 β 1 headpiece ( 36 ) , except for omission of TEV cleavage . Sources of SG / 19 and TS2 / 16 ( 14 ) and 12G10 , 8E3 , SNAKA51 , HUTS - 4 , and 9EG7 ( 29 ) were as described . N29 ( 40 ) and mAb13 ( 41 ) hy - bridomas were kind gifts of J . Wilkins ( University of Manitoba , Winnipeg , MB ) and K . M . Yamada ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) , respectively . IgGs were purified by protein G affinity , and Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion . Fibronectin Fragments . Human Fn3 7 – 10 ( mature residues 1 , 142 – 1 , 509 ) , Fn3 9 – 10 ( mature residues 1 , 326 – 1 , 509 with an N - terminal His 6 tag ) , or the Fn3 9 – 10 Ser - 1417 to Cys mutant were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described ( 26 ) , exceptHis tag affinitypurification was used forFn3 9 – 10 . Fn3 7 – 10 was used in EM because domains 7 and 8 helped localize the α 5 β 1 - binding site in Fn3 domains 9 and 10 . Fn3 9 – 10 was obtained in higher yield and could easily be concentrated highly , and was therefore used in Fab cross - competition assays . The Fn3 9 – 10 S1417C mutant was specifically labeled at C1417 with Alexa Fluor 488 C5maleimide ( Thermo FisherScientific ) for use asa reporter in Fab cross - competition assays ; Fn3 7 – 10 has a native unpaired Cys residue ( C1201 ) in Fn3 domain 7 . EM . α 5 β 1 ( 100 μ g / mL ) alone or with five molar equivalents of Fab ( 100 μ g / mL ) or Fn3 7 – 10 ( 80 μ g / mL ) in 20 mM Tris buffered saline ( pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 ( α 5 β 1 and Fab complexes ) or with 1 mM MnCl 2 ( Fn3 7 – 10 complex ) was held for 20 min at 21 °C and then subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration in the same buffer . Peak fractions were applied to glow - discharged grids , stained with 0 . 75 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl formate ( 8 ) , and imaged with an FEI Tecnai T12 microscope and Gatan 4K × 4K CCD camera at 67 , 000 × magnification ( 1 . 68 Å pixel size ) and - 1 . 5 μ m defocus . Well - separated particles of reasonable sizes for integrins were interactively picked using EMAN2 ( 42 ) as illustrated in SI Appendix , Fig . S1 . Class averages were calculated by ( i ) multireference alignment followed by K - means clus - tering using SPIDER ( 9 , 43 , 44 ) and also ( ii ) iterative stable alignment and clustering using SPARX ( 45 ) . Cross - correlations were with 2D projections generated at 4° intervals from 20 - Å - filtered α 5 β 1 closed crystal structures , models of the open headpiece made by substituting the open β 3 subunit from Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ID code 2VDR for the β 1 subunit in PDB ID code 3VI3 , or by superposition of SG / 19 - bound α 5 β 1 in PDB ID code 3VI3 onto the α V β 3 ectodomain in PDB ID code 4G1E . Cell Adhesion . Microtiter plate wells adsorbed with Fn3 7 – 10 or plasma fi - bronectin ( 10 μ g / mL in 50 μ L ) at 4 °C overnight were blocked with 3 % ( wt / vol ) BSA in PBS . K562 cells ( kept in PBS with 0 . 5 % BSA ) were fluorescently labeled with 2 ′ , 7 ′ - bis - ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) - 5 - ( and - 6 ) - carboxyfluorescein , acetoxymethyl ester ( BCECFAM ) at37°Cfor30minandwashedwith5mMEDTA . Cells ( 2 × 10 6 permL , 50 μ L ) in PBS with 1 % BSA and 25 μ g / mL Fabs in either 1 mM CaCl 2 / 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM MnCl 2 , or 10 mM EDTA were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and washed thrice . Adherence was measured as the ratio of fluorescence intensity post and before wash . Fab Cross - Competition . K562 cells ( 2 × 10 6 per mL ) in phenol red - free L15 medium with 1 % BSA were incubated with high , specified concentrations of unlabeled Fabs with or without Fn3 9 – 10 at 21 °C for 90 min , mixed with lower , specified concentrations of Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled Fabs or Fn3 9 – 10 for 30 min , and then without washing subjected to immunofluorescence flow cytometry . Mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) was measured . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Li - Zhi Mi for help with EM data collection and processing . This work was supported by NIH Grant HL - 108248 . 1 .
