Scientists’ Participation in University Research Centers : What are the Gender Diﬀerences ? Elizabeth Corley 1 Monica Gaughan 2 ABSTRACT . University - aﬃliated multidisciplinary research centers have grown in importance in academia . Most research to - date has focused on these centers from an institutional per - spective , with recent work only beginning to explore the ways in which such centers aﬀect the development of academic careers . Hence , little is known about how scientists who are center - aﬃliated diﬀer from those who are not aﬃliated . Clearly , both selection and inﬂuence eﬀects may be expected to operate in terms of research productivity , timing , and resources . A further puzzle is how center aﬃliation may diﬀer between male and female scientists . In this study , we use a new , nationally rep - resentative dataset of scientists and engineers working in Carnegie Research Extensive universities to develop an under - standing of how center - aﬃliated scientists diﬀer from exclu - sively department - based academic scientists and engineers , and investigate the extent to which gender moderates the eﬀects of centers . As expected , our national sample shows that women are younger , whiter , less likely to be tenured , and at a lower rank than their male colleagues . We ﬁnd that women are as likely to join centers as men , and do so at a similar stage in their career . Most of the male – female diﬀerences observed in disci - plinary settings are sustained in centers , but women appear to have greater research equality in them ( compared to the departmental setting ) . In particular , men and women in centers spend the same amount of time writing grant proposals , con - ducting both grant - supported and unfunded research , and administering grants . This suggests that centers may constitute an institutional context in which some aspects of gender equity in science may be achieved . JEL Classiﬁcaton : C42 , O32 , Z13 , E61 1 . At the forefront of US production of scientists and engineers The development of national research infrastruc - ture is central to the American innovation system , and the Research Extensive universities are a crucial component of that engine of growth ( Crow and Bozeman , 1998 ) . A large body of work has demonstrated that female academic scientists remain disadvantaged in their access to research resources , and the rewards that attend them such as productivity and career progression . However , this work has focused almost exclusively on scientists in traditional academic departments . A question we believe has received insuﬃcient attention is what role the development of university - based research centers , in which 40 % of academic scientists and engineers now work , plays in the career prospects and patterns of underrepresented groups . In this paper , we seek to explore how centers and depart - ments diﬀer in creating contexts for female aca - demic career success . Our own earlier work leads us to expect that centers create diﬀerent opportunity structures for female scientists ; in this study , we use a better sampling strategy to investigate our earlier ﬁndings ( Gaughan and Bozeman , 2002 ; Corley et al . , 2003 ; Bozeman and Corley , 2004 ) . We brieﬂy recapitulate the ﬁndings about women academic scientists , bearing in mind that this special issue addresses the literature compre - hensively . We focus especially on university - based research centers as new organizational contexts for scientiﬁc career development . We ﬁnd there are few studies that link the direct eﬀects of university - based science centers on academic scientists , or that provide clues to how faculty members per - form in them . There is enough work , however , to use the two literatures to generate hypotheses to evaluate men’s and women’s experiences in university - based science centers at Research Extensive universities . We then test these hypoth - eses using data from the 2004 Survey of Academic Researchers completed by the Research Value 1 Arizona State University , School of Public Aﬀairs , Tempe , AZ 85287 - 0603 E - mail : elizabeth . corley @ asu . edu 2 Georgia Institute of Technology , School of Public Policy , 685 Cherry Street NW , Atlanta , GA , 30332 E - mail : monica . gaughan @ pubpolicy . gatech . edu Journal of Technology Transfer , 30 : 371 – 381 , 2005 (cid:1) 2005 Springer Science + Business Media , Inc .

Finally , we draw some general conclusions about how our results may inform science policy within university - based science centers . 2 . Academic women in science By the 1990s the promise of aﬃrmative action to redress gender inequity in universities had largely been realized ( Cole , 1979 ; NRC , 1987 , 2001 ) . Yet women remain under - represented in the senior tenured ranks , and over - represented in oﬀ - ladder positions ( Barber , 1995 ; NRC , 2001 ) . Early work on scientiﬁc careers evaluated how science is socially stratiﬁed by a variety of ascriptive and acquired traits ( Cole andCole , 1973 ) . This generateda stream of research that evaluated the determinants of women’s lower academic career success ( Long and Fox , 1995 ) . The university remains an employment sector that is highly sex segregated , with negative consequences for the women in it ( Reskin , 1978 ; Bielby and Barron , 1986 ; Jacobs , 1996 ) . Xie and Shauman ( 2003 ) attribute gender dif - ferences in outcomes to gender diﬀerences in per - sonal and structural characteristics that bear on typical scientiﬁc output measures such as publi - cation productivity and research resources . Numerous studies have been conducted that elu - cidate some of the individual - level mechanisms for these diﬀerential career outcomes . For example , women have diﬀerential access to resources during training ( Reskin , 1978 ; Fox , 1995 ) , and experience less mentoring and collaboration during their career ( Long and McGinnis , 1985 ) . Also , they tend to be less productive , which has negative impacts on career progression ( Long et al . , 1993 ) . Overall , women are thought to beneﬁt less from organiza - tional factors that improve productivity ( Allison and Long , 1990 ; Long and McGinnis , 1991 ) . On the job , female academics are more aware of and sensitive to the presence of organizational con - straints ( Fox and Ferri , 1992 ) . These constraints tend to reduce productivity and collaboration activity of female scientists ( Fox , 1991 ) . Given what is known about women in com - petitive academic science at universities , it is important to investigate how variations in the institutional context itself aﬀect career develop - ment . Center aﬃliation is an important new basis of structural location in the academic structure , one we know little about in its place in the development of the academic career in general , or gender diﬀerences in particular . If center researchers are more productive , then center - aﬃliates can be expected to beneﬁt from the same contextual boost that Allison and Long ( 1990 ) found in departments . University - based research centers Since the 1980s interactions between industry and universities have become increasingly important in the development of R & D conducted at US uni - versities ( Gray et al . , 2001 ) . According to Cohen and colleagues ( 1994 ) about 70 percept of indus - try’s support for academic research is channeled through roughly 1100 industry – university centers that they identiﬁed in 1993 . As Boardman and Bozeman ( forthcoming ) have noted , in the US the past three decades could be credibly called the ‘‘era of inter - institu - tional research collaboration . ’’ Increasingly , US science funding agencies are supporting central - ized , interdisciplinary research centers that rep - resent a diﬀerent institutional form from the decentralized , individual - investigator research of the past . Bozeman and Boardman ( 2004 ) use a detailed analysis of the National Science Foun - dation ( NSF ) Engineering Research Centers ( ERCs ) to demonstrate how the rise of university - based science centers has led to the development of a new institutional form for the execution of university - based research . The National Science Foundation’s Industry / University Cooperative Research Centers ( IUCRC ) Program , which originated in 1973 , is one of the oldest government initiatives focused on coopera - tive research across the industry and university sectors ( Hetzner et al . , 1989 ) . The purpose of the NSF IUCRC program is to strengthen the rela - tionship between industrial ﬁrms and universities , especially colleges of engineering ( Adams et al . , 2001 ) . In ﬁscal year 2000 , the NSFs contribution to the centers was about $ 5 . 2 million ; however , industrial and other external support of the centers totaled about $ 68 million in FY 2000 ( National Science Foundation , 2005 ) . Currently there are approximately 50 IUCRCs , all of which are administered by the Engineering Education 372 Corley and Gaughan and Centers Division at the National Science Foundation . Managers of university - based science centers face many challenges that are diﬀerent from the challenges faced by traditional , academic depart - ment directors : namely , how to manage research within a new organizational structure that involves researchers from diﬀerent disciplines , who bring diverse collaboration incentives and research goals to center - based research ( Boardman and Boze - man , forthcoming ) . Even though there is some early recognition that university - based science centers represent a new institutional form for the performance of scientiﬁc research ( Bozeman and Boardman , 2003 ) , few studies have focused on exploring the eﬀects of the new institutional form on individual scientists careers . In fact , many of the past studies on university - based science centers have concentrated on centers that explicitly involve university – industry collaborations ( Jaﬀe , 1989 ; Rees , 1989 ; Cohen et al . , 1994 ; Rosenberg and Nelson , 1994 ; Mansﬁeld and Lee , 1996 ; Narin et al . , 1997 ) . Many focus on the study of indus - trial - university cooperative research centers ( IUCRCs ) , which are deﬁned as ‘‘small academic centers designed to foster technology transfer between universities and ﬁrms’’ ( Adams et al . , 2001 , p . 73 ) . The literature in this area , however , largely explores how IUCRCs aﬀect organizations that participate in the centers—i . e . , universities or industrial ﬁrms ( for example , Blumenthal et al . , 1986 ; Geisler et al . , 1991 ; Mowery , 1995 ; Cohen et al . , 1998 ; Santoro and Chakrabarti , 1999 ; Adams et al . , 2001 ; Gray and Steenhuis , 2003 ) — and not on the impacts of center aﬃliation for individual faculty participants . Although the large majority of studies on IUCRCs focus on organization - level units of anal - ysis , there are a few scholars who have attempted to determine ( in a general way ) how IUCRCs might aﬀect individual researchers . Cohen et al . ( 1998 ) studied the impact IUCRCshave on university - level research . They argued that the rewards from uni - versity research traditionally come from reputa - tion—largely because reputation promotes faculty mobility , and mobility leads to salary increases and teaching reductions . Therefore , Cohen and col - leagues argued that the rewards of academic research depend largely on the dissemination of research ﬁndings and open access to science results . Hetzner et al . ( 1989 ) also brieﬂy mention the issue of individual faculty participation in IUCRCs . They report that faculty members expect research funding to ﬂow from their participation in IUCRCs—especially because of the excessive proposal writing requirements placed on them as members of these centers . Additionally , Hetzner and colleagues say some faculty report that par - ticipation in centers leads to more interactions with other faculty , more support for student research , greater access to equipment , and im - proved consulting and research opportunities . Hetzner and colleagues conclude , therefore , that these centers appear to be supporting some of the traditional core of faculty activities . We believe that science and engineering research centers truly are a new organizational form in academe—and that researchers partici - pating in these centers experience new challenges ( and , hopefully , new advantages ) as a result of their center aﬃliation . Prior research informs how science centers can be more eﬀective and / or pro - ductive , but the impact that those centers have on individual researchers’ careers—especially women—is not developed . Since there is little published research on the impacts of center aﬃli - ation on individual faculty careers ( in general ) and female faculty ( in particular ) , we use the intersec - tion of the two literatures to create some new hypotheses for the research presented here . Women and centers : unanswered questions In this paper , we explore how the recent setting of university - based science centers may have diﬀer - ential impacts on ( 1 ) scientists in general and ( 2 ) female scientists in particular . In general , we hypothesize that university - based research centers expose scientists ( of all genders , ethnic groups , and levels of seniority ) to greater opportunities for research . Therefore , we believe that scientists conducting research through university - based re - search centers will have access to more research resources than those not participating in centers and have more time for research relative to other academic obligations . We also expect to see diﬀerences in the advan - tages ( and disadvantages ) that women and men receive from their center aﬃliations . In particular , we hypothesize that women scientists are more 373 Scientists’ Participation in University Research Centers likely to be aﬃliated with university - based science centers , are more likely to be disadvantaged by carrying heavier service obligations because of their center participation , and in general receive fewer individual beneﬁts of their center aﬃliation ( such as satisfaction with job and feeling appreci - ated by colleagues ) . Stated formally , we make the following hypotheses : H1 Center - based scientists have access to more research resources than department - based scien - tists . H2 Center - based scientists have more time for re - search relative to other academic obligations . H3 Female scientists are more likely to be aﬃli - ated with university - based science centers . H4 Female scientists are more likely to be disad - vantaged by carrying heavier service obligations because of their center participation . H5 Female scientists are more likely to be disad - vantaged by carrying heavier service obligations because of their center participation . 3 . Research design and data collection Earlier work that we have conducted on center - based researchers revealed no statistically signiﬁ - cant diﬀerences between male and female researchers on likelihood of receiving grants , amount of grants , and publications ( Corley et al . , 2003 ) . We believe these ﬁndings are partially the result of the research design we employed . First , only researchers at Energy Research Centers and National Science Foundation Science and Tech - nology Centers were included in the study . Second , only 13 % of the study sample was female ( which was , nevertheless , representative of those centers ) . We believe that gender - selection dynamics had already played out in the careers of these high - achieving female scientists in especially male - dominated disciplines . In the ﬁrst study , we observe them after they have joined a multidisci - plinary center , and we did not collect data that would have allowed us to compare them to exclusively department - based researchers . In the current study , we solve many of the design limitations of the original center study . Rather than collect data from center - based researchers , we collect data from university - based researchers , many of whom are also center - aﬃli - ated . First , we study a representative sample of scientists and engineers in Carnegie Extensive Universities , allowing us to compare center - aﬃli - ated researchers with those who are not aﬃliated . Second , we extend the scope of our sample to disciplines likely to yield Center aﬃliations that are not exclusive to Energy Research Centers and NSF S & T Centers . Finally , we over - sample women scientists to ensure that there is suﬃcient sample size to understand gender dynamics—both between men and women , and within gender groups . The data for the current study come from the 2004 Survey of Academic Researchers completed by the Research Value Mapping Program ( Barry Bozeman , PI ) . Whereas the ﬁrst study adminis - tration was targeted to center - based researchers , the 2004 study administration targets the popula - tion of scientists and engineers in tenure track ( or tenured ) academic positions at Carnegie Extensive universities ( formerly known as Research I ; Carnegie , 2000 ) . Using the Carnegie list , we re - tained all universities ( n = 150 ) that produced at least one Ph . D . in 2000 in at least one of 13 science and engineering disciplines . We excluded health sciences and economics from the National Science Foundation deﬁnition of science and engineering ( NSF , 2000 ) , and we subdivided engineering into ﬁve major specialties . The resulting disciplines include : biology , computer science , mathematics , physics , earth and atmospheric science , chemistry , agriculture , sociology , chemical engineering , civil engineering , electrical engineering , mechanical engineering , and materials engineering . Having delineated the target population of universities and disciplines , we then collected the names of tenure - track faculty in each university by discipline . The list of faculty was obtained from ( 1 ) the on - line university catalog , or ( 2 ) the on - line departmental website . This resulted in a sampling frame of 36 , 874 scientists and engineers occupying a tenure track or tenured faculty position . The target sample was for 200 men and women from each of the 13 disciplines . Because the size of dis - ciplines varies , as does the representation of women in each discipline , the sampling propor - tions varied from 0 . 21 ( for women in biology ) to 374 Corley and Gaughan 1 . 0 in ﬁve disciplines ( e . g . the ‘‘sample’’ is actually a census of the women in the discipline ) . Men’s sampling proportions varied from 0 . 06 in biology , to 0 . 23 in agriculture . The ﬁnal target sample ( accounting for women representing fewer than 200 in the discipline ) was 4916 . Therefore , the 2004 Survey of Academic Researchers is unique in its ability to determine the representation of researchers in university - based research centers , and to make comparisons between those aﬃliated with them , and scientists who are not . In addition , the over - sampling of women means that gender diﬀerences can be evaluated by center aﬃliation and discipline . The survey was administered by mail , focusing in particular on the following domains of faculty activity : funding , collaboration , institutional aﬃl - iations , and career timing and transitions . The survey also obtained basic demographic informa - tion about the researchers , their research - speciﬁc motivations and values , and the perceived beneﬁts derived from their work . In this study , we focus on research resources and beneﬁts , and teaching and service burdens as characteristics that we hypoth - esize diﬀer between center aﬃliates and non - aﬃl - iates , and between men and women . We obtained 1769 survey responses from sci - entists and engineers who were in tenure track positions , had an earned Ph . D . , and who had complete information on center participation . There are 916 female respondents and 853 male respondents . There are 693 center - based researchers , and 1076 researchers who report departmental aﬃliations only ( note , all center - based researchers also have a departmental aﬃli - ation ) . 4 . Data analysis We begin our data analysis simply , examining univariate characteristics and bivariate diﬀerences by gender and institutional setting . The ﬁrst column shows the means and standard deviations of the 1769 scientists and engineers in the sample . About 82 % are white , 39 % are aﬃli - ated with a multidisciplinary center , and half are women ( reﬂecting the over - sample of women in the design ) . The average respondent has been in a tenure track position for 15 years ; as a result , 71 % are tenured , and 46 % are full professors . The average professor spends 7 . 66 h per week on grant writing and administration , 18 . 52 h per week on research , and 17 . 27 h per week teaching . The fac - ulty collaborate with , on average , 5 . 48 other pro - fessionals , and supervise 4 . 21 graduate students . They spend 8 . 9 h per week on other types of ser - vice work . On a four point scale , they tend to be neutral as to whether they are paid what they are worth , somewhat more positive about being appreciated , and very positive about their job satisfaction . It should be remembered that the over - sampling of women drawn for this study makes it impossible to make inferences to param - eters based on pooled means . We address this issue by comparing means of women and men , as each sample is representative of its respective gender group . Further , in our multivariate analysis we control for gender to evaluate the institutional eﬀects , a strategy recommended by Winship and Radbill ( 1994 ) . Table 1 also provides a perspective on institu - tional and gender diﬀerences . The second two panels show t - test diﬀerences between the means of department - based and center - based professors , and between female and male professors . Signiﬁ - cant diﬀerences in means at the 0 . 05 level or better are shown in bold . Considering ﬁrst the mean diﬀerences by institutional setting ( middle panel ) , we ﬁnd there is no diﬀerence in demographic characteristics , career stage or in the service hours per week spent in professional service or paid consulting . Center - based researchers , however , spend more time on grant writing , conducting funded research , administering grants , collaborat - ing with colleagues ( both men and women ) , and supervising graduate students ( both men and wo - men ) . These aﬃliated researchers spend less time than their department - based colleagues conduct - ing unfunded research and teaching undergraduate students . Center - based scientists also feel more satisﬁed with their jobs , pay , and perceived appreciation . If research and graduate teaching are the plum assignments in the Research Extensive universities , then centers are superior to depart - ments on every dimension . We next examine mean diﬀerences between 916 female and 853 male scientists ( right panel ) . Women are less likely to be of color , comprising only 15 % of the female scientists and engineers . 375 Scientists’ Participation in University Research Centers Women spend more time writing grant proposals , but less time working on unfunded research . Wo - men also supervise more female graduate students , and collaborate more ( with both male and female scholars ) . The female scientists in our sample are less satisﬁed with their jobs , and feel less appreci - ated by their colleagues for their research contri - butions . As expected , women are less likely to be tenured or full professors , the result of their younger career age . Men and women are equally likely to be aﬃliated with multidisciplinary research centers , about 40 % . Given the diﬀerences in the pattern of signiﬁcant diﬀerences between center and department - based researchers , and male and female researchers , we also examine the dynamic role of gender and institutional setting on these constructs of interest . Table 2 presents the results of an ANOVA analysis of the 2 * 2 factorial design ( center / noncenter ; male / female ) with interaction eﬀects . Because the cells are unbalanced , we use general linear modeling ( GLM ) rather than a classic ANOVA estimation . The table reports the F - statistic associated with the total mean sum of squares ( left panel ) . The remaining columns report the F - statistic associated with decomposing the total mean sum of squares into a direct gender eﬀect ( middle left panel ) , a direct institutional setting eﬀect ( middle right pa - nel ) , and an interaction eﬀect ( right panel ) . Looking ﬁrst at the F statistic associated with the total mean sum of squares ( left panel ) , we ﬁnd that variation in almost all of the constructs is explained signiﬁcantly by the inclusion of gender and institutional setting .

Looking at the decomposition of eﬀects , we ﬁnd a mix of direct eﬀects , with few interaction eﬀects . To explain all career event variables , the variance is explained by gender , and not by institutional setting . These are the only variables for which gender is the only explanation . Furthermore , there is an additional signiﬁcant eﬀect of being a center - based female on career age . Variables for which the institutional setting is the only signiﬁcant predictor are : grant supported research , administering grants , teaching under - graduates , number of male graduate students , and perceiving that one is paid what one is worth . Recall that center - based researchers do more grants activity , teach fewer undergraduates , and advise more graduate students than their depart - ment - based peers . These activities do not depend on the gender of the researcher . For many variables , we ﬁnd that gender and institution each have independent direct eﬀects . This is true for writing grant proposals , conduct - ing unfunded research , the number of female graduate students supervised , the number of pro - fessional collaborators , and level of job satisfac - tion . Our ability to predict these dependent variables is improved by the knowledge of both gender and institutional setting . There is only one signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect in the mixed models , that for feeling appreciated . Recalling again Table 1 ( and using other results not shown ) , wo - men as a group feel less appreciated by their col - leagues , center - based researchers as a group feel more appreciated by their colleagues , and center - based women fall between these two groups in their level of feeling appreciated .

We found no signiﬁcant gender diﬀerences in the perceived beneﬁts of center - aﬃliation on the following con - structs : government contracts , opportunity for journal or interdisciplinary publishing , commer - cialization opportunities , autonomy , proposal approval , access to students , collaboration opportunities , or equipment , teaching load , and prospects for tenure . In Table 3 we show the three variables on which there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between male and female center - aﬃliates . The women perceive fewer opportunities for industry - supported grants and contracts , and fewer consulting opportunities ( a perception supported by women’s signiﬁcantly reduced participation in paid consulting irrespec - tive of institutional setting ) . By contrast , the women perceive greater opportunities to publish applied research as a result of their center aﬃliation . 5 . Discussion Now we revisit our original hypotheses regarding the impacts of center aﬃliation on individual sci - entists . We expected that centers would expose scien - tists to greater opportunities for research . This hypothesis was supported by the data .

Table IV Statement of hypotheses and results Hypothesis Result ( H1 ) Center - based scientists have access to more research resources than department - based scientists . Hypothesis conﬁrmed by data . Center - based faculty spend signiﬁcantly more time writing grant proposals , conducting funded research , and administering grants . ( H2 ) Center - based scientists have more time for research relative to other academic obligations . Hypothesis partially supported by data . University and professional service obligations for center - based and department - based faculty are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ; however , center - based faculty have more graduate student teaching duties and fewer undergraduate student teaching duties . ( H3 ) Female scientists are more likely to be aﬃliated with university - based science centers . Hypothesis rejected by data . Male and female scientists are equally likely to be aﬃliated with university - based centers . ( H4 ) Female scientists are more likely to be disadvantaged by carrying heavier service obligations because of their center participation . Hypothesis partially supported by data . Male and female center - based faculty spend the same amount of time teaching graduate students and engaging in unpaid service activities ; however , females spend slightly more time teaching undergraduates and less time on paid consulting . ( H5 ) Female scientists receive fewer individual beneﬁts of their center aﬃliation ( such as salary contribution , satisfaction with job , and feeling appreciated by colleagues ) . Hypothesis partially supported by data . Even though center - based scientists of both genders do not diﬀer when asked if they feel that they are paid what they are worth , male scientists are more satisﬁed with their jobs . 378 Corley and Gaughan writing grant proposals , conducting funded research , and administering grants . This was true for both men and women . Our second hypothesis was that center - based scientists ( of both genders ) would have more time for research relative to other academic obligations . This hypothesis , however , was not fully supported by the data . University and professional service obligations for center - based and department - based faculty were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent . Center - based researchers have heavier graduate student teaching duties , but department - based faculty spent more time on undergraduate teaching . In general , the data in this study demonstrate the center - based faculty have more research resources ( and spend more time on research ) than tradi - tional , department - based scientists , but they also spend as much or more time on service obligations and teaching . In other words , it appears that center - based scientists have chosen to put in longer hours to reap the beneﬁts of center aﬃliation . We also hypothesized that women and men would experience diﬀerent advantages from their center aﬃliations . In particular , we expected that women scientists would be more likely to be aﬃl - iated with university - based science centers , be more likely to be disadvantaged by carrying hea - vier service obligations because of their center participation , and receive fewer individual beneﬁts of their center aﬃliation . First , we found that female scientists are as likely to be aﬃliated with a center as male academic scientists . Second , male and female center aﬃliates spend the same amount of time on ( 1 ) teaching graduate students , ( 2 ) professional and community service , and ( 3 ) uni - versity service . In addition , scientists of both gen - ders supervised roughly the same number of male and female graduate students . The major discrep - ancies in service and teaching obligations for aﬃliated male and female scientists were related to teaching undergraduates ( women spent 10 . 02 h per week on this activity while men spent 8 . 45 ) and paid consulting ( men spent 0 . 86 h per week on this activity and women spent 0 . 39 ) . With respect to individual beneﬁts of center aﬃliations , men and women are equally engaged in all facets of grant and research production . However , men are more likely to beneﬁt from industry and consulting opportunities . Men feel slightly more satisﬁed with their jobs than center - based women do . However , center - aﬃliated male and female scientists do not diﬀer when asked if they felt that they were paid what they are worth . In summary , centers appear to perform an equalizing function with respect to those factors that facilitate the production of research , like grant writing and access to graduate students . Signiﬁcantly , women do less paid consulting , and perceive fewer consulting and industrial opportu - nities than their center - aﬃliated male colleagues . To the extent that industrial opportunities create research production advantages , then women in centers enjoy more resources than their female colleagues , but fewer than their male colleagues . Furthermore , center - based women teach more undergraduate students than their male colleagues . Other bases of diﬀerence between men and women remain the same , irrespective of the institutional location of the scientist : men are older , more experienced , and more secure , and are generally more satisﬁed with their jobs . 6 . Conclusion The results of this research yield some positive news : university - based science centers could potentially serve as a leveling ﬁeld for male and female academic researchers . Even though male and female center - aﬃliated scientists had busier work days ( and spent more time working on grant writing ) than their department - based colleagues , the center - aﬃliation provides a source of academic resources and recognition that elevates the female scientists to a research work environment similar to that of their male peers . We continue to be concerned about the gender diﬀerence in oppor - tunities for consulting , and for industry support . If universities become more interdependent with industry , then women’s lower access to industrial opportunities is worrisome . This study is necessarily exploratory in nature ; much explanatory work remains to be done . In particular , in further research we will introduce a longitudinal component using the curriculum vitae of half the scientists and engineers studied here . This will enable us to investigate sequencing and timing eﬀects that cannot be studied in the cross - sectional design we employ here . Wewouldlike to investigate , for example , the temporal relationships among 379 Scientists’ Participation in University Research Centers center aﬃliation timing , research productivity , and career progression . At this point , we do not know if center aﬃliation is the result of career progression and productivity , or whether it exerts independent eﬀects on career velocity and productivity , or both—and under what conditions . We would like to investigate whether the nature of the center itself aﬀects center beneﬁts and disadvantages , and whe - ther there are individual - level diﬀerences in the propensity to aﬃliate by type of center .
