However , the changes in biophysical properties of cancer cells undergoing EMT remain elusive . Here , we measured , via video particle tracking microrheology , the intracellular stiffness of head and neck cancer cell lines with distinct EMT phenotypes . We also examined cells migration and invasiveness in different extracellular matrix architectures and EMT - related sig - nalling in these cell lines . Our results show that when cells were cultivated in three - dimensional ( 3D ) environments , the differences in cell morphology , migration speed , invasion capability and intracellular stiffness were more pronounced among different head and neck cancer cell lines with distinct EMT phenotypes than those cultivated in traditional plastic dishes and / or seated on top of a thick layer of collagen . An inverse correlation between intracellular stiffness and invasiveness in 3D culture was revealed . Knock - down of the EMT regulator Twist1 or Snail or inhibition of Rac1 which is a downstream GTPase of Twist1 increased intracellular stiffness . These results indicate that the EMT regulators , Twist1 and Snail and the mediated signals play a critical role in reducing intracellular stiffness and enhancing cell migra - tion in EMT to promote cancer cells invasion . KEYWORDS cancer cells migration , epithelial - mesenchymal transition , intracellular stiffness , Snail three - dimensional ( 3D ) cell culture environments , Twist 1 1 | INTRODUCTION Epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a process via which the epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire the mesenchymal phe - notype . EMT has been shown to be crucial in development , organ fibrosis and cancer metastasis . 1 - 3 In cancer cells , the key features of EMT include a remodelling of cytoskeletons and a reduction in the intercellular adhesion between epithelial cells ; concomitantly , the cel - lular morphology changes from cuboidal epithelial to elongated mes - enchymal , which leads to enhanced migration & invasiveness and elevated resistance to apoptosis . 1 , 2 To date , most of the studies of EMT focus on its molecular and cellular biological aspects , including the signal transduction and the changes in biological behaviour .

Cell mechanics plays an important role in determining the meta - static potential of cancer cells . 3 - 5 Compared with the normal cells , the metastatic cancer cells are often softer , have less amount of cytoskeletons and are more invasive in trespassing through blood vessels . 6 Recently , it has been reported that cell stiffness can serve as a biomarker of the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells . 7 Most of the previous biomechanical studies focused mainly on cells cultured in non - coated dishes , where cells are seated on a two - dimensional ( 2D ) glass substrate with stiffness on the order of 3GPa . The natural physiological environment of cells is , however , often three - dimensional ( 3D ) , where cells are embedded in a complex dynamic environment of 3D extracellular matrixes ( ECM ) 8 with stiff - ness in the range of tens of Pa to a few KPa , depending on the specific microenvironments . 9 Extracellular matrix is an important mediator of cellular physiologi - cal and pathological functions . 10 - 12 Depending on the specific physio - logical and pathological scenarios , cells sense different chemical and physical cues from the ECM ( including its stiffness and architecture ) via different signal transduction pathways to convert the physicochemical stimuli into biochemical signals 13 and respond dynamically . 14 - 21 In gen - eral , the cellular responses may include changes in focal adhesion , 14 cytoskeletal organization , 14 , 16 migration speed and trajectory , 19 cellular differentiation , 17 , 18 proliferation 20 and intracellular stiffness . 11 , 22 It has been well - established that when cells are cultured in more rigid ECM , their focal adhesion , cytoskeletal organization and stiffness tend to increase . 11 , 14 , 16 , 22 In addition , the ECM microenvironment also regu - lates phenotypes of cancer cells . These studies imply that there is an intimate correlation between cell mechanics and cellular response to different ECM stiffness and architectures . However , the interplays among intracellular stiffness , geometry and stiffness of ECM and EMT progression have not yet been well characterized . We previously demonstrated that the EMT regulator Twist1 induces mesenchymal migration of head and neck squamous cell car - cinoma ( HNSCC ) cells through suppression of let - 7i to activate Rac1 , and that the effect could only be observed in 3D cells culture . 23 We therefore speculate that EMT - induced cellular migration is associated with the changes in biophysical and biomechanical properties in 3D environment . In this study , we investigate the interplay between cell stiffness and EMT in HNSCC cells . 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | Cell lines and shRNA experiments The human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cell lines ( FaDu , CAL - 27 , SAS , OEC - M1 ) were cultured in RPMI - 1064 supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin solution at 37 (cid:1) C , 5 % CO 2 . For shRNA experiments , we used two indepen - dent sequences to knock - down Snail or Twist1 in OEC - M1 or SAS cells . The first system for shRNA experiment was the pLKO . 1 system . For gene silencing , pLKO . 1 - shLuc , Snail shRNA ( TRCN0000063819 and TRCN0000063821 ) , and Twist1 shRNA ( TRCN0000020540 and TRCN0000020542 ) were obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility of Taiwan . The second system for shRNA experiment was the pSUPER system . A hairpin sequence containing the shRNA against Snail or Twist1 was cloned into pSU - PER . puro vector , and a scrambled sequence was used as a control . In OEC - M1 cells , both pLKO . 1 and pSUPER system were used . In SAS cells , we used pLKO . 1 system with two independent sequences to knock - down Snail or Twist1 . The sequences of shRNA are given in Supplementary Table S1 . 2 . 2 | Culturing cells in different collagen matrix architectures The 2D , 2 . 5D and 3D collagen type 1 matrices were prepared based on the method & procedure reported by Yang et al 23 The concentra - tion of collagen type 1 ( ECM675 , Millipore ) is 1 . 71 mg / mL , and the corresponding matrix stiffness is ~ 259 Pa . 2 . 3 | Video particle tracking microrheology We applied video particle tracking microrheology ( VPTM ) 24 to mea - sure intracellular stiffness of HNSCC cell lines cultured in three dif - ferent matrix architectures . Carboxylated polystyrene particles ( Invitrogen , fluorescence excitation / admission peaks : 580 / 605 nm , diameter = 200 nm , concentration = 1 . 35 x 10 12 particles / mL ) were injected into the cells by a biolistic particle delivery system ( PDS - 100 , Bio - Rad ; pressure 450 psi ) . After particle injection , cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated for 4 hours . Then the parti - cles - bearing cells ( approximately 10 - 25 particles per cell ) were cul - tured in different ( 2D , 2 . 5D and 3D ) matrix architectures for 16 hours . Brownian motion of individual intracellular particles were recorded for 10 seconds via a fluorescence microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a cell incubation chamber ( TOKAI , Japan ) , an oil - immersion objective lens ( Nikon , 100x / N . A . = 1 . 45 ) , and a CMOS camera ( Hamamatsu , Hamamatsu , Japan , OHCA - Flash 4 . 0 , 1024 9 1024 pixels ) , which enables us to record the images at a frame rate of 100 frames per second , and a spatial resolution of 0 . 13 l m / pixel . The two - dimensional projection of the trajectories of the Brown - ian motion of each particle [ x ( t ) and y ( t ) , as a function of time ( t ) ] were tracked and analysed via customized Matlab software ( Math - Works , Natick , MA ) . 24 , 25 We calculated the ensemble - averaged mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) , < D r 2 ( s ) > = < [ x ( t + s ) (cid:1) x ( t ) ] 2 + [ y ( t + s ) (cid:1) y ( t ) ] 2 > , the effective creep compliance J ( s ) and the elastic modulus G 0 ( x ) from the trajectory of each particle . 11 J ð s Þ ¼ p a K B T \ D r 2 ð s Þ [ ( 1 ) G 0 ð x Þ ¼ ½ J ð s Þ(cid:3) (cid:1) 1 ( 2 ) where “ a ” is the particle ’ s radius , K B the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature . The intracellular stiffness ( in Pascal , 3838 | CHEN ET AL . Pa ) was measured and compared in terms of the value of the elastic modulus G 0 ( x ) at frequency f = x / 2 p = 10 Hz . Although our measurements allow us to determine G 0 ( x ) in the frequency range of approximately 0 . 1 - 100 Hz , the frequency of 10 Hz was chosen because at lower frequency , the experimental results may be affected by the noise due to any possible low - frequency drift as well as the system 1 / f noise , and the higher frequency is lim - ited by the frame rate of the CMOS camera . Furthermore , 10 Hz is the typical frequency often used by many researchers in the cell mechanics community to compare the intracellular stiff - ness . 24 - 26 A schematic illustration of our experimental procedure for the measurement of intracellular stiffness in different extra - cellular matrix architectures based on VPTM is given in Figure 1 . Although VPTM provides not only the elastic modulus G 0 ( x ) , but also the viscous modulus G 0 ( x ) , we have deliberately excluded all the data related to the viscous modulus , because our results ( not shown ) indicate that , in the context of this paper , all the corre - sponding changes in G ” ( x ) are much less significant and also much less consistent . 2 . 4 | Western blot analysis For Western blots , cells were harvested and lysed in the pro - tease inhibitor - containing lysis buffer . The protein lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred onto a PVDF membrane ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) and stained with proper antibod - ies . Signals were developed using an enhanced chemilumines - cence kit ( Millipore Corp . , MA ) and photographed with Fujifilm LAS - 4000 . The antibodies used in this study include the antibod - ies against E - cadherin ( # 4065 , Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . Danvers , MA ) , vimentin ( V6630 , Sigma - Aldrich Corp . , St . Louis , MO ) , Snail ( # 17732 , Abcam plc . , Cambridge , UK ) and Twist1 FIGURE 1 A schematic illustration of the measurement of intracellular stiffness in different extracellular matrix architectures based on video particle - tracking microrheology . A , Carboxylated polystyrene particles ( Invitrogen , fluorescence excitation / admission peaks : 580 / 605 nm , diameter = 200 nm , concentration = 1 . 35 x 10 12 particles / mL ) were injected into the cells by a biolistic particle delivery system ( PDS - 100 , Bio - Rad ; pressure 450 psi ) . B , After particle injection , cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated in different extracellular matrix architectures ( 2D , 2 . 5D , and 3D ) for 16 h . C , Brownian motion of individual intracellular particles were recorded for 10 s via a fluorescence microscope equipped with a cell incubation chamber , an oil - immersion objective lens ( 100x , NA = 1 . 45 ) , and a CMOS camera , which enables us to record the images at a frame rate of 100 frames per second , and a spatial resolution of 0 . 13 l m / pixel . D , The two - dimensional projection of the trajectories of the Brownian motion of each particle [ x ( t ) and y ( t ) , as a function of time ( t ) ] were tracked and analysed . E , The ensemble - averaged mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) , and the elastic modulus G 0 ( x ) were deduced from x ( t ) and y ( t ) CHEN ET AL . | 3839 ( # 50581 , Abcam plc . , Cambridge , UK ) ; and b - actin ( MAB1501 , Chemicon International Inc . , Billerica , MA ) was used as a loading control . ImageJ software was used for densitometric measure - ments of the Western blots . 2 . 5 | 2D cell migration assay A 8 l m Boyden chamber was used for migration assay . 10 5 cells in medium containing 0 . 5 % serum were seeded in the upper chamber , and 15 % FBS was added to the medium in the lower chamber as the chemoattractant . After 16 hours , cells on the upper side of the filter were removed , and cells that remained adherent to the under - side of the membrane were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342 dye . The condition of 2 . 5D transwell invasion assay was the same as that of the 2D migration assay , except that the migration period was 24 hours and the inserts were coated with Matrigel . 2 . 6 | 3D invasion assay Cells were plated for attachment , then the supernatant was removed and covered with collagen solution ( 1 . 7 mg / mL ) . 10 % FBS - containing medium was added as a chemo - attractant , and the plates were incu - bated at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 for 24 hours . After incubation , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and stained with Alexa - 488 coupled to phalloidin . A set of 2 - D image slices was collected in each well from the bottom of the well up to a height of 60 l m via a laser confocal microscope . The invasion index was calculated as the number of cells in 3D images reconstructed from 30 slices of 2 - D images from the depth of 31 - 60 l m . 2 . 7 | Cell mobility speed Cells were allowed to adhere on 1 . 7 mg / mL collagen for 16 hours , then observed ( and their images recorded every 10 minutes ) for 24 hours in a humidified , CO 2 - equilibrated chamber with a Leica DM IRBE microscope ( Leica Microsystems Inc . , IL ) . The trajectory of individual cells was tracked by MetaMorph (cid:3) software ( Molecular Devices , Inc . , CA ) . 2 . 8 | Statistical analysis Statistical significance of the experimental results was evaluated by Student ’ s t test and indicated by * for P < 0 . 05 and * * for P < 0 . 01 . 3 | RESULTS 3 . 1 | The epithelial - type head and neck cancer cells exhibit larger increment in stiffness in 3D ECM architecture To investigate the impact of EMT phenotypes and different ECM architectures on cellular stiffness in HNSCC cells , we measured the intracellular stiffness via video particle - tracking microrheology ( VPTM ) 24 - 29 of HNSCC cells cultured in three different matrix architectures , including 2D ( where cells were cultured on non - coated glass dishes with a stiffness ~ 3 GPa ) , 2 . 5D ( where cells were cultured on top of a thick layer ~ 190 l m of collagen type 1 with a stiffness ~ 259 Pa coated on glass dishes ) and 3D ( where cells were embedded in 3D collagen type 1 with a stiffness ~ 259 Pa ) 23 ( Figure 1 ) . VPTM enables us to measure the dynamic viscoelasticity , with sub - cellular spatial resolution on the order of 1 l m , and with a frequency range ~ 0 . 1 - 100 Hz , of living cells in different micro - environments , including cells embedded in 3D ECM , which is rather challenging , if not impossible , via other tech - niques . Four HNSCC cell lines ( FaDu , CAL - 27 , SAS , and OEC - M1 ) with well - characterized EMT phenotypes were used in this study . In 2D culture , FaDu cells harbour the typical epithelial cells char - acteristics including a cobblestone - like morphology and the expres - sion of the epithelial marker E - cadherin . In contrast , SAS and OEC - M1 cells exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype including a fibroblastoid - like morphology and the expression of the mesenchy - mal marker vimentin ( Figure 2A , B ) . The morphology of cells cul - tured in 2 . 5D and 3D systems were distinct from the morphology in 2D : the epithelial - type cancer cells showed a round morphol - ogy , whereas the mesenchymal - type cells were elongated with protrusions ; the differences were more pronounced in 3D environ - ment ( Figure 2B ) . However , the expression of the EMT markers ( E - cadherin , vimentin , Snail , and Twist1 ) in HNSCC cell lines cul - tured in 2 . 5D and 3D system were similar to those in 2D culture ( Figure S1A ) . Besides , all four phenotypes of HNSCC cells cultured in 2D , 2 . 5D and 3D systems for 24 hours showed no significant differences in cell proliferation ( Figure S1B ) . Next , we investigated the intracellular stiffness of the four phe - notypes of HNSCC cells cultivated in 3 different ECM architectures . Specifically , we applied VPTM to measure the intracellular stiffness ( or elastic modulus ) , in the frequency range of approximately 0 . 1 - 100 Hz , of HNSCC cell lines cultured in three different matrix archi - tectures , including 2D , 2 . 5D and 3D . To facilitate the comparison , intracellular stiffness at the frequency of 10 Hz was used in this paper . When cells were cultivated in 2D environment , the intracellular stiffness was in the range of 74 - 83 Pa without significant differ - ences among the 4 cell lines ( Figure 2C ) . In 2 . 5D environment , the intracellular stiffness of mesenchymal - type OEC - M1 and SAS cells were significantly lower than that of the epithelial - type can - cer cells CAL - 27 and FaDu ( Figure 2D ) . Interestingly , when cells were embedded in 3D architecture , the intracellular stiffness of all 4 types of cells ( FaDu , CAL - 27 , SAS , & OEC - M1 ) increased by a factor of ~ 3 . 7 , 2 . 0 , 1 . 4 , and 1 . 1 , respectively , compared with the corresponding values in 2D ECM environment ( Figure 2E ) . The increment in intracellular stiffness was significantly higher in epithelial - type cells than in mesenchymal - type cells ( Figure 2C - E ) indicating that the intracellular stiffness of epithelial - type cells was more sensitive to the different ECM architectures in comparison with the mesenchymal - type . 3840 | CHEN ET AL . 3 . 2 | An inverse correlation between cellular stiffness , EMT phenotype and migration capability in 3D environment Next , we investigated the effect of different ECM architectures on cellular migration and stiffness . For cell migration measurements , we used non - coated transwells for 2D culture , Matrigel - coated tran - swells for 2 . 5D system and collagen - embedded wells for 3D . Our results show that the mesenchymal - type cancer cells exhibited a higher migration capability than the epithelial - type cells in all three systems . Notably , the differences were more pronounced in 3D sys - tem than in 2 . 5D and 2D . In 3D cells culture , the epithelial - type can - cer cells were relatively stiff and barely migrated ; in contrast , the mesenchymal cells were relatively soft and highly migratory ( Figure 3A - C ) . Consistently , the increment in cell stiffness was also more pronounced in 3D compared with 2 . 5D and 2D , but only in epithelial - type cells , and not in mesenchymal cells ( Figure 3D - G ) . A strong inverse correlation between EMT progression with invasive - ness and intracellular stiffness of HNSCC cells was revealed in 2 . 5D & 3D environment ( Figure 3H ) . Taken together , these results reveal that the biomechanical , physical and chemical behaviours of cells cultured in 2D environment differ drastically from those in 3D ; hence , cells culture in 3D could be an important first step towards a cell model system for better mimicking cellular behaviour in vivo . 3 . 3 | Knock - down of the EMT regulator Twist1 or Snail increases intracellular stiffness and reduces cell migration capability Of the several possible molecular mechanisms in EMT progression , Twist1 has been identified as a master regulator of morphogenesis which plays an essential role in tumour metastasis . 30 , 31 We previ - ously reported that Twist1 cooperates with BMI1 to suppress the expression of microRNA let - 7i , resulting in the activation of Rac1 and inducing mesenchymal movement in 3D environment . 31 In this study , we observed that , in 3D culture environment , Rac1 activation of mesenchymal - like HNSCC cells ( SAS & OECM - 1 ) were signifi - cantly higher than that of epithelial - type cells ( FaDu & CAL27 ) ( Fig - ure S2 ) . As the effect of the other major EMT inducer Snail on the migration capability of cells in 3D culture is unclear , and the impact of knock - down of EMT inducers on intracellular stiffness is elusive , we further examined the effects of suppression of Twist1 , Snail , Rac1 and Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) activities on intracellular FIGURE 2 Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) architecture influences cell morphology and intracellular stiffness of HNSCC cell lines ( FaDu , CAL - 27 , SAS and OEC - M1 ) .

We used two independent shRNA systems ( pSUPER , see Figure 4 ; and pLKO . 1 , see Figure S3 ) containing different sequences to knock - down Snail or Twist1 in OEC - M1 cells ( Figures 4A and S3A , B ) . The wild - type OEC - M1 cells exhibited a mesenchymal morphology in 3D culture . Knock - down of either Twist1 or Snail had a prominent effect in abrogating the elongated morphology , generated a round cell ( Figures 4B and S3C ) and reduced the activation of Rac1 ( Fig - ure S3D ) . Inhibition of Rac1 activity by NSC23766 or ROCK activity by Y27632 also partially attenuated the cellular protrusion and FIGURE 3 The migration capability and intracellular stiffness ( at 10 Hz ) of HNSCC cell lines in different extracellular matrix architectures .

In 2 . 5D system , knock - down of either Snail or Twist1 or inhibition of Rac1 reduced the cell migration speed ; the suppression of ROCK led to a similar , but smaller effect ( Figures 4C and S3E ) . Likewise , in 3D environment , both Twist1 and Snail knockdown had a significant impact in reducing cell invasion ( Fig - ures 4D , E and S3F , G ) . After confirming the impact of different EMT regulators and Rac1 / ROCK inhibitors in HNSCC migration in 3D system , we FIGURE 4 The effect of EMT signalling on cellular migration and intracellular stiffness .

Our results showed a consistent increment of intracellular stiffness in OEC - M1 cells receiving shRNA to knock - down Twist1 . Knockdown of Snail increased intracellular stiffness in one of the two clones ( Figures 4F and S3H ) . Inhibition of Rac1 activity by Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 also increased intracellular stiffness in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure S4A , B ) , but did not affect the phosphory - lation of myosin light chain ( Figure S4C ) , whereas the inhibition of ROCK activity induced a reduction in intracellular stiffness ( Fig - ure 4F ) . Furthermore , we investigated the role of myosin light chain ( MLC ) phosphorylation in cell invasion and intracellular stiffness of OEC - M1 cultured in 3D environments . Our results showed that inhi - bition of myosin light chain phosphorylation by blebbistatin treat - ment resulted in decreased invasion capability ( Figure S5A , B ) and intracellular stiffness ( Figure S5C ) . To further confirm the effect of EMT on cellular migration and intracellular stiffness in 3D environ - ments , we used two independent shRNA sequences to suppress Twist1 or Snail in another mesenchymal - type HNSCC cell line SAS . Consistently , our results showed that knock - down of either Snail or Twist1 abrogated mesenchymal morphology , suppressed migration and invasion in 3D culture ( Figure S6A - E ) . Notably , suppression of either Twist1 or Snail caused an increment in intracellular stiffness of SAS cells ; compared with Snail , Twist1 had a more prominent effect in SAS cells ( Figure S6F ) . Conversely , we stably expressed Twist1 or Snail in epithelial - type HNSCC cells ( FaDu ) cultured in 3D environments . Enforced either Twist1 or Snail expression in FaDu cells resulted in decreased intracellular stiffness ( Figure S7 ) . 4 | DISCUSSION The biomechanical and biophysical properties of cancer cells and the surrounding ECM modulate the metastatic capability of tumours . Most of the studies focus on the impact of ECM on cancer metasta - sis . Accumulated evidences support that tumour tissues are stiffer than healthy tissues , correlated with an increase in ECM stiffness through increasing collagen deposition and cross - linking within tumour stroma . 32 , 33 In contrast , investigations of the intracellular stiffness of cancer cells during metastasis are relatively limited . A reduction in intracellular stiffness maybe helpful for cancer cells to deform and to penetrate through stiffer tumour stroma and endothelial cell - cell junction in cancer metastasis . 5 However , the change in intracellular stiffness during EMT is unclear . In this study , we analysed intracellular stiffness in four HNSCC cell lines with dis - tinct EMT phenotypes and cultured in different extracellular matrix architectures to better understand the interplays among the cell mechanics , cellular external environment and EMT . In 3D ECM envi - ronments , the intracellular stiffness bears a strong inverse correlation with cell invasiveness and the expression of biomarkers of EMT . Among the four cell lines , the most mesenchymal phenotype , OEC - M1 , is the softest and the most invasive , whereas the most epithelial phenotype , FaDu , is the stiffest and the least invasive . Knock - down of the EMT inducers ( Twist1 or Snail ) or suppression of the down - stream signal ( Rac1 ) attenuates the effect of EMT - reduced intracellu - lar stiffness . In general , softer cell body in conjunction with better migration capability in EMT may contribute to enhance their ability to invade through blood vessels , and thereby increasing their metas - tasis potential . An interesting finding of this study is that when cells were culti - vated in conventional 2D cell culture environment , all four HNSCC cells with distinct EMT phenotypes showed no significant differences in intracellular stiffness . Surprisingly , a significant increase in intracel - lular stiffness was observed in epithelial - type HNSCC cells ( FaDu and CAL - 27 ) , whereas the mesenchymal - type HNSCC cells ( OEC - M1 and SAS ) did not show any significant change . These findings imply that the ECM architectures may play a crucial role in modulating the biophysical and the biochemical characteristics associated with EMT . In summary , our experimental studies of HNSCC cell lines show a significant difference in the intracellular stiffness of epithelial - like HNSCC cells versus that of mesenchymal - like HNSCC cells cultured FIGURE 5 A proposed model of the molecular pathways in EMT , including Twist1 - Rac signal axis and Snail , to regulate cellular migration and invasion capability and intracellular stiffness in EMT in cancer metastasis 3844 | CHEN ET AL . in 3D environment . A comparison of the intracellular stiffness of HNSCC cells cultured in 2D and 3D revealed that the incremental intracellular stiffness of epithelial — type cells were significantly higher than that of the mesenchymal - type cells . Our studies also reveal that in 2 . 5D and 3D cell culture environments , EMT progres - sion is strongly correlated with the invasiveness of the cells and intracellular stiffness ; more mesenchymal phenotypes show higher invasiveness and lower intracellular stiffness , whereas more epithelial phenotypes show lower invasiveness and higher intracellular stiff - ness . Moreover , our results also associate the decreased intracellular stiffness and increased invasiveness with Twist1 - Rac1 pathway or Snail - mediated pathway . These results jointly support our hypothesis that intracellular stiffness , in conjunction with other cellular biophysi - cal properties such as migration speed and cell morphology , may cor - relate strongly with the degree of malignant progression , and may thus serve as important complementary metrics in the assessment of the metastatic potential of cancer cells . Based on these observations , we propose a model of the molec - ular pathways involving EMT , including Twist1 - Rac signal axis and Snail , to regulate cellular migratory and invasion capability and intra - cellular stiffness in EMT in cancer metastasis ( Figure 5 ) . Our results indicate that both EMT regulators , Snail and Twist1 , have a great impact in regulating migration capability and cellular stiffness in 3D system , suggesting the dominant role of EMT in regulating biochemi - cal and biomechanical characteristics of HNSCC cells in 3D microen - vironment .
