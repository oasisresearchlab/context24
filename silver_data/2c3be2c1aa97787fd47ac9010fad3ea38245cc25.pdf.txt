The cytostome is physically connected to the ﬂ agellar complex . To investigate if this association plays a role in endocytosis in T . cruzi , the endocytic activity in wild type and gp72 null mutant ( ﬂ agellum - cell body attachment region is absent ) epimastigotes was compared . Both wild type and mutant cells were incubated with transferrin conjugated with Alexa 543 or gold particles over different time periods and thereafter qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy . Flow cytometry analysis showed a reduction in transferrin uptake by null mutant after 30 min of incubation . In addition , at this time period , signals detected by ﬂ uorescence microscopy were slightly lower in null mutant cells . At lower incubation times , no differences between wild type and mutant epimastigotes could be observed . Quantitative data obtained by morphometric and ﬂ ow cytometry analysis suggested that the speed of the endocytic process in the null mutant was similar to wild type cells , although null mutants were not able to bind cargo and therefore internalize as much as wild type epimastigotes . Our observations suggest that the physical association between cytostome and the ﬂ agellar complex plays a role in endocytosis ef ﬁ ciency by epimastigotes of T . cruzi . © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd .

In contrast , protozoa of the Trypanosomatidae family have a highly polarized endocytic activity that occurs exclusively in the ﬂ agellar pocket and the cytostome regions [ 1 – 3 ] . In epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi , previous studies have shown that about 85 % of the endocytic activity occurs in the cytostome [ 4 ] . The cytostome is a specialized structure formed by an invagination of a well - de ﬁ ned region of the protozoan surface located at the anterior region and close to the ﬂ agellar pocket . Endocytic vesicles formed at the ﬂ agellar pocket or the cytostome fuse with a branched vesicular – tubular network that compose the early endosomes . Following this , cargo - containing vesicles deliver nutri - ents to the T . cruzi storage organelles , the reservosomes [ 4 – 6 ] . Characteristic features of epimastigote forms include the presence of an asymmetric ﬂ agellar pocket , the lateral emergence of the ﬂ agellum and its attachment to the cell body throughout the anterior region of the protozoan , which forms a complex structure known as the Flagellar Attachment Zone ( FAZ ) [ 7 ] . The proteins involved in the establishment of the T . cruzi FAZ region have not been completely described . However , two groups of proteins appear to play some role in this process : an immuno - dominant membrane glycoprotein of 72 kDa ( gp72 ) and several high molecular weight proteins . gp72 was extensively studied and , although concentrated in the FAZ region , it is also distributed over the cell body surface and in the proximal region of the ﬂ agellum [ 8 ] . Using target gene replacement , Cooper and colleagues [ 9 ] have developed a T . cruzi gp72 epimastigote null mutant , which had an unexpected morphology characterized by the detachment of the ﬂ agellum from the cell body , leading to major alterations in the overall shape of the parasite [ 10 ] . Previous work by our group has shown that gp72 null mutants display alterations in the ﬂ agellum - cell body attachment [ 7 ] . gp72 mutants also showed alterations in the ﬂ agellar pocket ( FP ) opening and in the organization of the anterior region , where the cytostome is localized .

Rocha et al . / Parasitology International 59 ( 2010 ) 629 – 633 Experiments were conducted by incubating wild type and gp72 null mutants in the presence of transferrin conjugated with Alexa 543 or gold particles for different periods . The uptake and intracellular fate of these particles were later detected using ﬂ ow cytometry , ﬂ uorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . Our results clearly demonstrate that the absence of the FAZ region impairs the normal ﬂ ux of cargo uptake by the cytostome complex , a ﬁ nding that reinforces the presence of a physical association between the cytostome and the ﬂ agellar complex in epimastigotes of T . cruzi . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Parasites Epimastigote forms of T . cruzi Y strain ( wild - type ) and a gp72 null mutant of T . cruzi ( gp72 null , kindly supplied by Dr . George Cross , Rockfeller University , USA ) were used throughout this study . Both cell types were cultivated in Liver - Infusion Tryptose ( LIT ) medium supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % hemin for 3 – 6 days at 28 °C , as previously described [ 9 ] . G418 ( 400 μ g / mL ) was added to maintain gp72 null epimastigote cultures as previously suggested [ 9 ] . In the experiments , G418 was removed on the culture medium . 2 . 2 . Endocytic tracers Colloidal gold particles ( 8 – 10 nm ) were prepared according to Slot and Geuze [ 11 ] . Bovine holotransferrin ( Tf , Sigma Chemical Company , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was coupled to gold particles as described by Roth [ 12 ] and used at a ﬁ nal concentration of 25 μ g / mL in culture medium . Tf - Alexa Fluor 543 from Molecular Probes ( Carlsbad , CA ) was used as ﬂ uorescent tracer at a ﬁ nal concentration of 2 . 5 μ g / mL . 2 . 3 . Endocytosis experiments Wild type and gp72 null mutant epimastigotes of the T . cruzi Y strain were collected by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 min and washed twice in serum - free LIT medium . Parasites ( 2×10 6 parasites / mL ) were incubated with 2 . 5 μ g / mL Tf - Alexa 543 or 25 μ g / mL Tf – Au in the same medium for 5 , 10 and 30 min at 28 °C . Tracers were removed by washing with cold PBS . Parasites were resuspended in ﬁ xative solution and processed for ﬂ uorescence microscopy , ﬂ ow cytometry or transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) as listed in Sections 2 . 4 – 2 . 6 . In some ﬂ ow cytometry analyses , parasites were incubated with Tf conjugated with Alexa 543 for 60 and 120 min at 37 °C . 2 . 4 . Flow cytometry Parasites obtained after endocytosis with Tf - Alexa 543 were ﬁ xed in freshly prepared 4 % formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer with a pH of 7 . 2 for 30 min , washed with the same buffer and analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry using a FACSCalibur instrument ( Becton Dickinson ) . The data from 10 , 000 cells were analyzed using Windows Multiple Document Interface Flow Cytometry Application ( WinMDI ) 2 . 9 version software . As a control , wild type and gp72 null mutant epimastigotes without ﬂ uorescent endocytic tracer were used . 2 . 5 . Fluorescence microscopy After incubation with Tf - Alexa 543 at 28 °C for 5 , 10 and 30 min , parasites were ﬁ xed in 4 % freshly prepared formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer with a pH of 7 . 2 for 30 min , washed with the Fig . 2 .

Electron microscopy Wild type and mutant epimastigote forms were incubated for different times with Tf – gold , washed with cold PBS and ﬁ xed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 60 min . Cells were then washed in PBS and post - ﬁ xed in a solution containing 1 % OsO 4 , 0 . 8 % potassium ferrocyanide , and 5 mM calcium chloride in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at a pH of 7 . 2 at room temperature for 40 min . They were then dehydrated in acetone and embedded in Epoxide resin . Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a Zeiss EM 900 transmission electron microscope . 2 . 7 . Morphometric analysis Pro ﬁ les of wild type and gp72 null mutant epimastigote forms of T . cruzi incubated for different times ( 5 or 30 min ) with Tf – gold were randomly selected as representatives of each cell type . At least 75 cell pro ﬁ les of each group ( 5 and 30 min ) were acquired and measured and their Tf – gold particles counted when present . The number of gold particles ( GPs ) per square micrometer within endocytic regions ( i . e . , located in the cytostome – cytopharinx complex , vesicles and reservo - somes ) was determined . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was determined by the Student ' s t - test using the Mann – Whitney test . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry measurements of ﬂ uorescence accumulated in cells incubated in the presence of a ﬂ uorescent - labeled ligand have been shown to be an excellent approach to determine the incorpo - ration of ligands distributed in the cell population . No signi ﬁ cant differences in the ﬂ uorescence emitted by wild type and gp72 null mutants were observed when cells were incubated for 5 or 10 min in the presence of Alexa 543 - labeled Tf ( Fig . 1a – b , f – g ) . However , with 30 , 60 and 120 min of endocytosis , null mutant cells ( Fig . 1h – j ) showed a different pattern of Tf - Alexa incorporation with lower ﬂ uorescence intensity when compared to wild type cells ( Fig . 1c – d ) . Previous studies have shown that after a short time of incubation ( approx . 5 – 10 min ) , transferrin is concentrated at the cell surface , especially in the cytostome regions , and within the cytostome tube , also known as cytopharynx . At later stages , they are incorporated into vesicles and delivered to tubular structures and the reservosomes [ 4 , 13 ] . The cytometric measurements suggest that both cell popula - tions accumulate a similar amount of Tf - Alexa 5 and 10 min after endocytosis . Moreover , the ﬂ uorescence was more intense in wild type cells after 30 min . This result suggests that wild type cells can uptake more Tf - Alexa than gp72 null mutant cells ; this is likely because the uptake of nutrients near the cytostome region is facilitated in cells where the FAZ region is intact . In gp72 null mutant cells , the absence of the ﬂ agellum - cell body adhesion impairs , although not entirely , the uptake of nutrients through the cytostome . 3 . 2 . Fluorescence microscopy Fluorescence microscopy analysis was conducted to con ﬁ rm ﬂ ow cytometry data . Fig . 2 showed a depiction of Alexa 543 incorporation into the wild type ( Fig . 2a , c and e ) and gp72 null mutant ( Fig . 2b , d and f ) epimastigotes . After 5 min of incubation , labeling is restricted to well - de ﬁ ned structures of the anterior cell region in both cell populations ( Fig . 2a – b ) . After 10 min of incubation , labeling is also observed in intracellular structures , which may correspond to tubular intermediate structures and reservosomes ( Fig . 2c – d ) . The ﬂ uorescence intensity appears to be similar in both populations , a ﬁ nding that is in agreement with the results of the ﬂ ow cytometry . Fig . 3 .

Rocha et al . / Parasitology International 59 ( 2010 ) 629 – 633 However , after 30 min of incubation , ﬂ uorescence concentrated in the posterior region of the cell , where the reservosomes are located and was more intense in wild type cells when compared to null mutant parasites ( Fig . 2e – f ) . 3 . 3 . Transmission electron microscopy Ultrastructural analysis of cells incubated in the presence of gold - labeled Tf showed the ligand in a number of different endocytic structures and compartments , namely the ﬂ agellar pocket , the cytostome , the tubule - vesicular network and the reservosomes ( Fig . 3 ) . This approach precisely identi ﬁ ed the endocytic pathway structures labeled with Tf and the quantitative characterization of Tf uptake . In contrast to ﬂ uorescence microscopy and FACS , TEM analysis revealed differences in Tf uptake by wild type ( Fig . 3a – b ) and gp72 null mutant cells ( Fig . 3e – f ) as early as 5 min . The number of gold particles in the cytostome region was much greater in pro ﬁ les of wild type cells , although a similar density of gold particles seemed to be present in the reservosomes . After 30 min , the differences were more evident , especially in regions where the reservosomes were seen ( Fig . 3c – d , g – h ) . Morphometric analysis showed statistically signi ﬁ - cant differences ( p b 0 . 05 ) in Tf uptake into the cytostome and reservosomes of WT and gp72 mutants ( Table 1 ) . The intensity of labeling was about 3 to 4 times greater in the cytostome of WT cells submitted to 5 min of TF – Au endocytosis when compared with gp72 null mutant cells . In contrast , the reservosomes of this cell groupdid not showstatistically signi ﬁ cantdifferences ( p N 0 . 05 ) when compared to gp72 mutants that were previously qualitatively observed by TEM . After 30 min of incubation , labeling density in both thecytostomeandreservosomewasgreaterinWTcellswhencompared to gp72 mutants . In reservosomes , the particle density was almost 5 times greater than in mutant cells . The differences between FACS , ﬂ uorescence microscopy and TEM analyses might be explained by the higher resolution and sensitivity of the latter method . Using freeze - fracture replicas , Martínez - Palomo and colleagues [ 14 ] clearly demonstrated that the opening of the cytostome is located outside the ﬂ agellar pocket . A link between the cytostome and the ﬂ agellar pocket was described in another report where a monoclonal antibody ( 2C4 ) recognized microtubules localized between the cytostome and the ﬂ agellar pocket [ 15 ] . Our results demonstrate that epimastigote null mutants without the ﬂ agellum - cell body attachment region were unable to uptake the same amount of Tf as wild type parasites . This ﬁ nding suggests that the lack of ﬂ agellum attachment region and the physical association between the cytostome and ﬂ agellar complex [ 15 ] play important roles in the endocytic process of epimastigote forms of T . cruzi .
