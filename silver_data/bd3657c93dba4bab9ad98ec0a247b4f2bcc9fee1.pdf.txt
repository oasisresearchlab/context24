We examined the effects of nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir disproxil fumarate ( TDF ) and emtricitabine ( FTC ) and the integrase inhibitors dolutegravir ( DTG ) and elvitegravir ( EVG ) on viability , structure , and function of glutamatergic neurons ( a subtype of CNS neuron involved in cognition ) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSC - neurons ) , and primary human neural precursor cells ( hNPCs ) , which are responsible for neurogenesis . Using automated digital microscopy and image analysis ( high content analysis , HCA ) , we found that DTG , EVG , and TDF decreased hiPSC - neuron viability , neurites , and synapses after seven days of treatment . Analysis of hiPSC - neuron calcium activity using Kinetic Image Cytometry ( KIC ) demonstrated that DTG and EVG also decreased the frequency and magnitude of intracellular calcium transients . Longer ARV exposures and simultaneous exposure to multiple ARVs increased the magnitude of these neurotoxic effects . Using the Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes ( MIEL ) assay , we found that TDF decreased hNPC viability and changed the distribution of histone modifications that regulate chromatin packing , suggesting that TDF may reduce neuroprogenitor pools important for CNS development and maintenance of cognition in adults . This study establishes human preclinical assays that can screen potential ARVs for CNS toxicity to develop safer cART regimens and HAND therapeutics .

Combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) , which involves simultaneous treatment with 2 - 4 antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) , suppresses HIV replication , prevents progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , and extends life expectancy in adults with HIV to near normal 2 , 3 . Preexposure prophylaxis with cART can also prevent transmission of HIV to HIV - negative adolescents and adults at risk for behaviorally acquiring HIV 4 - 8 , as well as mother - to - child transmission 9 , 10 . cART has greatly reduced the incidence of AIDS - defining illnesses that affect the central nervous system ( CNS ) , including opportunistic infections , primary CNS lymphoma , and HIV - associated dementia ( HAD ) 11 - 14 . However , the post - cART era has seen increased incidence of milder forms of HIV - associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) , including mild cognitive disorder ( MND ) and asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment ( ANI ) 15 , 16 . HAND affects approximately 50 % of people living with HIV , including patients with undetectable viral loads 17 , 18 and can impact quality of life , employment , treatment adherence , and survival 19 - 21 . HAND can also increase the risk for progression to more severe cognitive impairment 22 , 23 . While many factors likely contribute to cognitive impairment in people with HIV on cART , there is growing concern that ARV neurotoxicity contributes 24 . In pigtail macaques , rodents , and cultured rodent neurons , ARV exposure can cause oxidative stress , endoplasmic reticulum stress , mitochondrial dysfunction , loss of neurites and synapses , and / or neuronal cell death 25 - 28 . In people with HIV , cART can reduce neuronal metabolite levels 29 , the volume and structural integrity of cortical white matter 30 , 31 , and cognitive reserve as measured by functional MRI 32 . While some studies link cART regimens with high CNS penetration effectiveness ( CPE ) with improved cognition 33 or no effect on cognition 34 , others link high CPE with worse cognitive outcomes 35 , 36 , including a study with 61 , 938 people with HIV 37 . Treatment interruption in HIV + individuals with stable immune function can also improve neurocognitive performance for extended time periods 38 . People with HIV must remain on cART for their lifetime to maintain viral suppression 39 , 40 , leaving them vulnerable to increased neurotoxicity during neurodevelopment and aging . Indeed , children with HIV receiving cART have reduced cognition 41 - 43 , and HIV - children who received perinatal cART experience developmental delays 44 . cART also increases production and reduces clearance of Alzheimer’s disease - associated beta amyloid peptides in vitro 45 - 47 and in patients 48 , 49 , which may accelerate CNS aging and cognitive decline . In previous research using HCA and KIC , we found that tamoxifen , an anti - cancer agent linked to post - chemotherapy cognitive impairment , reduces synapses and calcium transient activity of primary rat hippocampal neurons , establishing that these in vitro techniques can test agents for potential negative impacts on cognition 50 . In this study , we aimed to develop human preclinical neurosafety testing platforms to screen ARVs for a broad range of potential neurotoxic and neurodevelopmental effects . We first developed HCA and KIC assays using glutamatergic neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSC - neurons ) , which provide an in vitro model system with similar gene expression , cell biology , and electrophysiology to neurons in the human brain in which to test directly for compound toxicity 51 - 53 . We also developed an assay to test ARVs for potential effects on neurogenesis , a process by which human neural precursor cells ( hNPCs ) differentiate to neurons to support central nervous system development and cognitive function in adults 54 , 55 . For this , we used the MIEL assay , a multiparametric approach to identify changes in histone acetylation and methylation patterns using HCA of immunofluorescence images 56 . Using HCA and KIC methods on hiPSC - neurons , we found that the nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir disproxil fumarate ( TDF ) and emtricitabine ( FTC ) and the integrase inhibitors dolutegravir ( DTG ) and elvitegravir ( EVG ) altered key neuronal structures and functions to varying extents , and that combinations of these ARVs had additive effects . Additionally , the MIEL assay showed that TDF reduced viability and altered histone acetylation and methylation in hNPCs , indicating an epigenotoxic effect . Our findings suggest novel preclinical research strategies to test candidate ARVs in vitro and to aid in identifying ARVs with reduced neurocognitive effects . Materials and Methods Cell Culture . For hiPSC - neuron experiments , imaging - quality polystyrene 384 - well plates ( Greiner Bio - One # 781090 ; Frickenhausen , Germany ) were coated with 0 . 1 % polyethyleneimine and 0 . 028 mg / mL growth factor - reduced Matrigel ( Corning Life Sciences # 354230 , Tewksbury , MA , USA ) . hiPSC - derived glutamatergic neurons ( iCell GlutaNeurons ; Fujifilm CDI # C1060 , Madison , WI , USA ) were seeded at a density of 60 , 000 live cells / cm 2 and were maintained per the manufacturer’s instructions for a total of 14 days before assay . For hNPC experiments , imaging - quality polystyrene 384 - well plates ( Greiner Bio - One # 781090 ; Frickenhausen , Germany ) were coated with 0 . 028 mg / mL growth factor - reduced Matrigel ( Corning Life Sciences # 354230 , Tewksbury , MA , USA ) . Fetal hNPCs ( Thermo Fisher Scientific # A15654 ; Waltham , MA , USA ) were seeded at a density of 18 , 200 live cells / cm 2 and were maintained in differentiation medium per the manufacturer’s instructions for a total of 7 days before assay . Test Compounds . hiPSC - neuron cultures were treated with ARVs or ARV combinations for 1 or 7 days prior to assays . The following ARVs were used alone or in combination in this study : dolutegravir ( DTG ; Toronto Research Chemicals # D528800 ; Toronto , ON , Canada ) , elvitegravir ( EVG ; Toronto Research Chemicals # E509000 ) , tenofovir disproxil fumarate ( TDF ; Toronto Research Chemicals # T018505 ) , emtricitabine ( FTC ; Toronto Research Chemicals # E525000 ) , DTG + TDF + FTC , EVG + TDF + FTC , and TDF + FTC . Vehicle ( 0 . 2 % DMSO ) and antagonist control treatments ( 25 µM para - nitroblebbistatin ; Optopharma Ltd . # DR - N - 111 ; Budapest , Hungary ) were also applied to the cells . hNPCs were treated with 0 . 2 % DMSO , ARVs , SAHA ( Cayman Chemical # 10009929 ; Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) , GSK343 ( Cayman Chemical # 14094 ) , tofacitinib ( TOF , Cayman Chemical # 11598 ) , or ( + ) - JQ1 ( Cayman Chemical # 11187 ) . Automated Microscopy . The fixed - endpoint synapse and neurite length assay and microscopic imaging of the epigenetic landscape ( MIEL ) assay , as well as the live - cell calcium KIC assay were imaged using the IC200 - KIC automated microscope ( Vala Sciences Inc . ; San Diego , CA , USA ; Kinetic Image Cytometry® and KIC® are registered trademarks of Vala Sciences Inc . ) outfitted with a Plan Apo 20X / 0 . 75 NA objective lens ( Nikon Instruments Inc . ; Melville , NY , USA ) . For live - cell assays , the environmental chamber of the IC200 - KIC was set to 37°C / 5 % CO 2 . Synapse Density and Neurite Length Assay . After treatment , cells were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 1 . 67 % sucrose in HBSS without Ca + + / Mg + + , permeabilized in 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS with Ca + + / Mg + + , and blocked in 5 % normal goat serum / 1 % BSA / 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The following primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and applied to cells overnight at 4°C : chicken anti - βIII tubulin ( Tuj - 1 , 1 : 200 ; Abcam # ab41489 ; Boston , MA , USA ) , rabbit anti - PSD95 ( 1 : 200 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific # 51 - 6900 ; Waltham , MA , USA ) , and mouse anti - SV2 ( 1 : 150 ; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ; Iowa City , IA , USA ) . The next day , the following secondary antibody cocktail with Hoechst nuclear stain was made in 2 % BSA and applied to the cells for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark : goat anti - chicken IgY Alexa Fluor 555 ( 1 : 500 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific # A21437 ) , goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 ( 1 : 500 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific # A21245 ) , goat anti - mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1 : 500 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific # A11029 ) , and 10 µg / mL Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific # H3570 ) . For each well , a 3 - by - 3 matrix of images was acquired in each optical channel . Calcium KIC Assay . Neurons were incubated in a calcium indicator dye solution consisting of 5 µM Rhod - 4 AM ( AAT Bioquest # 21122 ; Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) , 1X PowerLoad ( Thermo Fisher Scientific # P10020 ) , 1 µg / mL Hoechst 33342 , and 2 . 5 mM probenecid in phenol red - free BrainPhys ( Stemcell Technologies # 05791 ; Vancouver , BC , Canada ) for 40 min at 37°C . The neurons were then rinsed with and imaged under phenol red - free BrainPhys . The calcium indicator dye solution and the imaging media did not contain DMSO or ARVs . One field of view was imaged per well , including a single image in the nuclear channel followed by a calcium movie acquired at 4 frames per second for 2 minutes . hNPC Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape ( MIEL ) Assay . After treatment , cells were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 1 . 67 % sucrose in HBSS without Ca + + / Mg + + and blocked / permeabilized in PBS with Ca + + / Mg + + and 2 % BSA / 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . The following primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and applied to cells overnight at 4°C to label key histone modifications associated with epigenetic regulation : rabbit H3K9me3 ( 1 : 500 ; Active Motif , 39765 ; Carlsbad , CA , USA ) ; mouse H3K4me1 ( 1 : 100 ; Active Motif , 39635 ; Carlsbad , CA , USA ) ; mouse H3K27me3 ( 1 : 250 ; Active Motif , 61017 ; Carlsbad , CA , USA ) ; and rabbit H3K27ac ( 1 : 500 ; Active Motif , 39133 ; Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Two sets of cells were immunolabeled for the biomarkers : one set with H3K27me3 and H3K27ac and a second set with H3K9me3 and H3K4me1 . The next day , the following secondary antibody cocktail with Hoechst nuclear stain was made in 2 % BSA and applied to the cells for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark : goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 ( 1 : 500 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific # A21245 ) , goat anti - mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1 : 500 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific # A11029 ) , and 10 µg / mL Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific # H3570 ) . Automated Image Analysis . For hiPSC - neuron synapse density , neurite length , and calcium KIC assays , images were analyzed using custom algorithms in CyteSeer software ( Vala Sciences Inc . ; CyteSeer® is a registered trademark of Vala Sciences Inc . ) . The NO2 v7 . 2 . 4 Neurite Morphology and Synapse Density with Somas algorithm was used to analyze the synapse density and neurite length images . This algorithm identified live neuronal nuclei as relatively large nuclei with diffuse Hoechst staining ( as opposed to small , bright , dead nuclei ) that colocalize with neuron - specific β III - tubulin ( Tuj - 1 ) staining . The algorithm then identified Tuj - 1 + neurites , which includes axons and dendrites . Small neurite fragments and Tuj - 1 + cellular debris were excluded , as well as the Tuj - 1 positive neuronal cell bodies ( somas ) . To identify synapses , the algorithm first identified SV2 + ( presynaptic ) and PSD95 + ( postsynaptic ) puncta with areas between 0 . 32 and 1 . 27 µm 2 ( between 3 and 15 pixels 2 with a pixel size of 0 . 325 µm ) . To be considered synapses , the SV2 + puncta centroids were required to be within 1 . 95 µm ( 6 pixels ) of the nearest neurite and within 0 . 975 µm ( 3 pixels ) of the nearest PSD95 + puncta centroid . Neuronal viability , neurite , and synapse data are presented as one data point per well , with each data point representing the average value across each of the 9 fields of view acquired per well . Each field of view contained about 200 live neurons in DMSO - treated control wells . The calcium KIC assays were analyzed with the Neuron Calcium KIC v10 . 5 algorithm . Neuronal cell bodies were identified as Rhod - 4 AM - positive areas associated with live neuron nuclei . The average pixel intensity of Rhod - 4 AM signal in each cell body was measured for each of the 480 frames ( 4 frames per second for two minutes ) . The resulting functions of Rhod - 4 AM average pixel intensity over time were baseline subtracted to determine if each neuron displayed calcium transients during the recording period and to calculate the event frequencies and mean peak amplitudes for each active cell . Event frequency and mean peak amplitude data are presented as one data point per well , with each data point representing the average value of all active neurons in each field of view . Each field of view contained about 200 live neurons in DMSO - treated control wells . For the MIEL assay , images were analyzed using Acapella 2 . 6 ( PerkinElmer ) , and image texture features were analyzed as described in Farhy , et al . , eLife , 2019 56 . Quadratic discriminant analysis was performed on histone modification texture features using the Excel add - on program Xlstat ( Base , v19 . 06 ) . Statistical Analysis . The data were analyzed with Prism ( GraphPad Software ; San Diego , CA , USA ) using ANOVA , followed by either Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post - hoc multiple comparisons test for statistical significance ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . Results HCA to characterize HIV ARV effects on neuronal viability and neurites in hiPSC - neurons . To test for ARV neurotoxicity , we exposed hiPSC - neurons to 0 . 1 , 1 , or 10 µM of DTG , EVG , TDF , or FTC for seven days . We chose these concentrations to test for neurotoxic effects at levels below , near , and above the plasma Cmax of each ARV ( Table 1 ) . We used 25 µM blebbistatin , a nonmuscle myosin II inhibitor 57 , 58 , as a control compound . We then fixed the hiPSC - neurons and immunolabeled for Tuj - 1 ( neuron - specific β III - tubulin ) , SV2 ( presynaptic protein ) , PSD95 ( postsynaptic protein ) , stained with Hoechst ( nuclei ) , and imaged the cells with the IC200 Image Cytometer to assess neuronal viability and morphology . Images of Tuj - 1 and nuclei show significant loss of neurites in hiPSC - neurons treated with 10 µM EVG , indicating a neurotoxic effect , with smaller effects for the other ARVs ( Fig . 1A ) . Image analysis with a CyteSeer algorithm that identifies the nuclei corresponding to live neurons ( see Methods ) determined that Neuronal Viability ( the percentage of live neuronal nuclei ) was significantly reduced by 30 % at 10 µM DTG , 65 % at 10 µM EVG , and 35 % at 10 µM TDF ( Fig . 1B ) . We did not observe changes in Neuronal Viability at lower concentrations of TDG , EVG , or TDF , or at any tested concentration of FTC . To further quantify effects of the ARVs , we used a CyteSeer image analysis algorithm that traces Tuj - 1 - positive neurites and calculates their length . The total neurite length per cm 2 image area ( Total Neurite Length ) was significantly reduced by 20 % at 10 µM DTG , 80 % at 10µM EVG , and 20 % at 10µM TDF ( Fig . 1C ) . The Neurite Length per Neuron ( Total Neurite Length divided by the number of live neuronal nuclei ) was slightly but significantly increased by 20 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) after treatment with 10 µM DTG but was 50 % lower after treatment with 10 µM EVG ( Fig . 1D ) . The Total Neurite Length and Neurite Length per Neuron remained similar to DMSO alone at lower concentrations of DTG , EVG , and TDF , and at all tested concentrations of FTC . Most HIV infections are treated with combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) consisting of two , three , or four ARVs from two or more different classes 2 - 4 . To test whether cART causes increased neurotoxicity and neurite loss compared to single ARVs , we compared Neuronal Viability and neurite length measurements in hiPSC - neurons treated with 10 µM DTG , EVG , TDF , FTC , or three combinations ( DTG / TDF / FTC , EVG / TDF / FTC , or TDF / FTC ; all ARVs at 10 µM ) . DTG / TDF / FTC has been the primary cART regimen in use in Botswana since 2016 for all people with HIV , including pregnant women 59 . TDF / FTC and EVG / TDF / FTC are components of Truvada and Stribild , respectively ( made by Gilead Sciences , Stribild also features cobicistat ) . Treatment with single or combination ARVs for one day did not affect Neuronal Viability , Total Neurite Length , or Neurite Length per Neuron ( Fig . 2A - C ) , although blebbistatin increased Total Neurite Length by 15 % ( Fig . 2B ) . By contrast , seven - day ARV and cART exposure caused significant neurotoxicity . Neuronal Viability was significantly reduced by 20 % by 10 µM DTG , 80 % by 10 µM EVG , 30 % by 10µM TDF , 70 % by DTG / TDF / FTC , 85 % by EVG / TDF / FTC , and 30 % by TDF / FTC ( Fig . 2D ) . We used the Tukey’s multiple comparisons test to test for significant differences between data from all test conditions and the DMSO control and between single ARVs to the ARV combinations ( see Supplemental Data for full results ) . Comparing ARV combinations to their components , TDF / FTC treatment led to similar Neuronal Viability to that of TDF alone , suggesting FTC does not affect TDF toxicity ( Table S1 ) . EVG / TDF / FTC treatment also led to similar Neuronal Viability to that of EVG alone , suggesting that TDF and FTC do not affect EVG toxicity . By contrast , DTG / TDF / FTC treatment significantly reduced Neuronal Viability compared to either DTG alone or TDF / FTC ( p < 0 . 001 for both comparisons ) , suggesting additive toxicity by these ARVs . Seven - day ARV exposure also significantly reduced Total Neurite Length for hiPSC - neurons treated with 10 µM EVG ( 85 % reduction ) , DTG / TDF / FTC ( 55 % ) , and EVG / TDF / FTC ( 90 % ) ( Fig . 2E ) . DTG / FTC / TDF treatment led to a 50 % lower Total Neurite Length than DTG alone ( p < 0 . 001 ) , while EVG / TDF / FTC treatment led to a similar neurite length to that of EVG alone . Neurite lengths were similar to DMSO for hiPSC - neurons treated with TDF , FTC , or TDF / FTC . Neurite Length per Neuron did not change significantly with any ARV treatment , but there was increased variability in wells treated with EVG , DTG / TDF / FTC , and EVG / TDF / FTC ( Fig . 2F ) . See Tables S2 and S3 for the results of comparisons between each condition for Total Neurite Length and Neurite Length per Neuron . For both Neuronal Viability and Total Neurite Length , EVG displayed dominant neurotoxic effects in combination treatments ( EVG alone reduced Neuronal Viability and Total Neurite Length to the same degree as EVG / TDF / FTC ) , while DTG and TDF had additive effects ( DTG / TDF / FTC reduced Neuronal Viability and Total Neurite Length to a greater extent than either DTG or TDF / FTC ) . HCA to characterize HIV ARV effects on synapses in hiPSC - neurons . To measure the effects of ARV treatments on hiPSC - neuron synapses , we used a CyteSeer image analysis algorithm that identifies synapses as SV2 ( presynaptic ) and PSD95 ( postsynaptic ) puncta near each other and Tuj - 1 - positive neurites . We defined Synapse Density as the number of synapses per cm 2 of the imaging area and Synapses / Neurite Length as the number of synapses per Total Neurite Length ( in microns ) . Figure 3A shows representative images of SV2 ( left ) and PSD95 ( center ) staining of hiPSC - neurons exposed to ARVs for seven days and the live neuronal nuclei ( green ) , neurites ( cyan ) , and synapses ( magenta ) identified by CyteSeer ( right ) . hiPSC - neurons treated with 10 µM EVG had fewer synapses , with smaller effects for the other ARVs . Effects on hiPSC - neuron synapses appeared at lower doses and for more ARVs than the effects on neuronal viability and neurite length . Synapse Density was significantly reduced by 1 µM DTG ( 30 % ) , 0 . 1 µM ( 20 % ) and 10 µM ( 75 % ) EVG , 1 µM ( 30 % ) and 10 µM ( 40 % ) TDF , 1 µM ( 20 % ) and 10 µM ( 30 % ) FTC , and blebbistatin ( 30 % ) ( Fig . 3B ) . DTG significantly reduced the Synapses / Neurite Length by 20 % at 0 . 1 µM and 30 % at 1 µM but had no effect at 10 µM ( Fig . 3C ) . EVG decreased the Synapses / Neurite Length by 25 % at 0 . 1 µM , had no effect at 1 µM , and increased the Synapses / Neurite Length by 20 % at 10 µM . TDF and FTC reduced the Synapses / Neurite Length at all tested concentrations ( 20 % , 25 % , and 20 % for 0 . 1 , 1 , and 10 µM TDF and 20 % , 20 % , and 30 % for 0 . 1 , 1 , and 10 µM FTC ) . Blebbistatin reduced the Synapses / Neurite Length by 20 % . In experiments comparing 10 µM doses of single ARVs to ARV combinations , one - day treatments did not affect the Synapse Density or Synapses / Neurite Length , although blebbistatin increased the Synapse Density by 20 % ( Fig 4A , B ) . By contrast , the Synapse Density was significantly reduced by seven - day treatment with EVG ( 90 % ) , DTG / TDF / FTC ( 60 % ) , EVG / TDF / FTC ( 90 % ) , and TDF / FTC ( 20 % ) ( Fig . 4C ) . DTG / FTC / TDF treatment led to a 50 % lower Synapse Density than that of DTG alone ( p < 0 . 001 , Tukey’s ) , while EVG / TDF / FTC treatment led to a similar Synapse Density to that of EVG alone . TDF / FTC treatment reduced the Synapses / Neurite Length by 20 % ( vs . DMSO , p < 0 . 001 ) , but this parameter was not affected by other ARV treatments ( Fig . 4D ) . See Tables S4 and S5 for the results of comparisons between each condition for Synapse Density and Synapses / Neurite Length . KIC to characterize HIV ARV effects on intracellular calcium transients in hiPSC - neurons . Neurons exhibit action potential - dependent and - independent peaks in intracellular calcium concentration that induce molecular and structural changes within neurons through calcium - sensitive effectors 60 - 62 . Dysregulation of neuronal intracellular calcium concentration and signaling occurs in aging , traumatic brain injury , and neurodegenerative diseases 63 . To test ARVs for effects on neuronal calcium transients , we treated hiPSC - neurons with 10 µM of each ARV alone or in combination for one or seven days . We then loaded the hiPSC - neurons with Hoechst and the calcium indicator Rhod - 4 and assayed the cells for calcium activity . For each well , we collected a single image in the nuclear channel and a digital movie in the Rhod - 4 channel at four frames per second for two minutes . We then used a CyteSeer KIC analysis algorithm originally developed for quantifying calcium transients in cardiac myocytes 64 and adapted to quantify neuronal calcium transients 50 . The algorithm measured the Rhod - 4 signal in the soma associated with each live neuron nucleus at each frame , enabling detection of each calcium transient that occurred in each neuron during the recording period . The algorithm then calculated parameters including the percent of neurons with calcium transients and frequency and amplitude of the transients . hiPSC - neurons exposed to DMSO alone for 7 days displayed between 0 and 50 calcium transients that were typically 5 to 30 seconds in duration during the two - minute recording periods ( Fig . 5A ) . hiPSC - neurons exposed to TDF , FTC , and TDF / FTC for 7 days displayed similar calcium transient activity to those treated with DMSO alone ( Fig . 5D , E , H ) , while neurons treated with DTG or DTG / TDF / FTC had less calcium transient activity compared to DMSO ( Fig . 5B , F ) and neurons treated with EVG or EVG / TDF / FTC were virtually inactive ( Fig . 5C , G ) . Quantification of the calcium transient activity showed no significant effects after one day of ARV exposure ( Fig . 6A - C ) . After seven days of ARV exposure , the percent active hiPSC - neurons was reduced by 30 % by DTG , 90 % by EVG , 70 % by DTG / TDF / FTC , 95 % by EVG / TDF / FTC , and 25 % by TDF / FTC ( Fig . 6D ) . DTG / TDF / FTC treatment led to 60 % lower percent activity than DTG alone ( p < 0 . 001 ) , while EVG / TDF / FTC treatment led to a similar effect on percent activity to that of EVG alone . The event frequency ( Fig . 6E ) was significantly reduced by EVG ( 40 % ) and by EVG / TDF / FTC ( 55 % ) , but not by any of the other treatments ( while event frequency for DTG / TDF / FTC was lower than for DMSO , this difference did not achieve statistical significance ) . The mean peak amplitude was also significantly reduced by 10 µM EVG ( 55 % ) and EVG / TDF / FTC ( 50 % ) , but not by any of the other treatments . See Tables S6 - 8 for the results of comparisons between each condition for percent activity , event frequency , and mean peak amplitude . Microscopic imaging of the epigenetic landscape ( MIEL ) analysis to characterize HIV ARV effects on hNPC epigenetic signature . To test for ARV effects on neurogenesis , we treated hNPCs with 0 . 1 , 1 . 0 , or 10 µM of each ARV for three days . After treatment with 0 . 1 , 1 . 0 , or 10 µM DTG , EVG , or FTC , hNPC viability was similar to DMSO controls . Treatment with 10 µM TDF , however , significantly reduced hNPC viability by 30 % ( Fig . 7A ) . hNPC viability was also reduced by 3 µM SAHA ( 45 % ) , a histone deacetylase inhibitor , and by 10 µM GSK343 ( 50 % ) , a histone methyltransferase inhibitor . hNPC viability was not affected by 0 . 3 µM JQ1 , which inhibits the interaction of bromodomain - containing proteins with acetylated histones , or by 1 µM tofacitinib , which inhibits JAK activity . To analyze ARV effects on hNPC epigenetics , we immunolabeled hNPCs for two sets of histone modifications : H3K27me3 ( condensed chromatin ) and H3K27ac ( active enhancers ) or H3K9me3 ( condensed chromatin ) and H3K4me1 ( primed enhancers ) . We then scanned the cells using Vala’s IC200 Image Cytometer and analyzed the images to identify the multivariate epigenetic signatures of each histone modification in each condition . We characterized the epigenetic signatures using texture features 56 , 65 , 66 rather than intensities and morphologies to reduce culturing and immunolabeling artifacts . Quadratic discriminant analysis reports changes in the epigenetic signatures in response to each treatment . SAHA and GSK43 , which decreased hNPC viability , also significantly affected the H3K27me3 / H3K27ac ( Fig . 7B ) and the H3K9me3 / H3K4me1 ( Fig . 7C ) epigenetic signatures , with discriminant analysis separating samples treated with these compounds from DMSO - and ARV - treated samples . Of the ARVs tested , only 10 µM TDF altered the epigenetic signature , with TDF - treated samples clustering together and separately from DMSO - , SAHA - , and GSK343 - treated samples in both H3K27me3 / H3K27ac and H3K9me3 / HeK4me1 plots ( Fig . 7B , C ) . Confusion matrices report the ability of the multiparametric discriminant analysis to correctly classify each sample with other samples that received the same treatment compared to other treatments ( Fig . 7D , E ) 56 . The confusion matrix for both H3K27me3 / H3K27ac and H3K9me3 / H3K4me1 show that classification occurred correctly 100 % of the time for samples treated with 10 µM GSK343 , 3 µM SAHA , and 10 µM TDF . This classification accuracy supports our conclusion that these three compounds are epigenotoxic and significantly alter the hNPC epigenetic landscape . Samples treated with DMSO , DTG , EVG , FTC , JQ1 , or TOF , which clustered together after discriminant analysis , were correctly classified less than 100 % of the time . The results from the MIEL assay demonstrate that TDF , but not DTG , EVG , or FTC , reduced viability and altered the pattern of the H3K27me3 , H3K27ac , H3K9me3 , and H3K4me1 epigenetic histone modifications in hNPCs . Discussion In this study , we developed HCA and KIC methods to quantify neurotoxic and neurodevelopmental effects of HIV ARVs in hiPSC - neurons and human neural precursor cells ( Fig . 8 ) . Loss of function and / or cell death in excitatory neurons resulting from ARV neurotoxicity could contribute to HIV - associated neurocognitive disorders ( HAND ) , which currently affect about half of people with HIV 17 , 18 . Because people with HIV develop non - AIDs - related health conditions , including cognitive decline , at an earlier age than the general population 67 - 69 , HAND is likely to increase in incidence and severity as the percentage of people with HIV over 50 years old increases 70 . ARV exposure during fetal development , childhood , and adolescence may also increase HAND incidence by affecting neurogenesis at key stages in CNS development . Human in vitro systems are needed to identify and mitigate ARV neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental effects . The methods used in this study feature automated digital microscopy and analysis for cell plated in 384 - well dishes , a format that facilitates higher throughput testing of ARVs at multiple concentrations and combinations , as well as testing of potential HAND therapeutics that may mitigate ARV neurotoxicity . Many previous in vitro studies of ARV neurotoxicity have been conducted with primary embryonic rat neurons . Exposure of these cells to 10 µM of the integrase inhibitor EVG for four days , but not two days , significantly reduced the number of MAP2 + neurons 28 , while 0 . 1 and 1 µM EVG were not neurotoxic . In this study , we found that seven - day exposure ( but not one - day exposure ) to 10 µM EVG reduced hiPSC - neuron viability , decreased neurite length and synapse density , and inhibited intracellular calcium transients , confirming the neurotoxicity of this compound in a human neuron model . We also observed milder toxic effects after treatment with 10 µM of the integrase inhibitor DTG and 10 µM of the nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor TDF . The nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor FTC , which forms a base for front - line recommended cART regimens in the US , was relatively non - toxic in our hiPSC - neuron model . Our data suggest that plasma , CSF , and brain concentrations of DTG , EVG , and TDF need to be managed to control HIV replication while minimizing ARV neurotoxicity . Efforts to increase the CNS penetration effectiveness ( CPE ) of ARVs such as EVG 71 and protease inhibitors 72 may decrease the CNS viral load but may also increase ARV neurotoxicity . Neuroimaging studies have shown that HAND patients on cART have locally compromised blood brain barriers 73 , which could increase ARV levels in the brain , even for ARVs with low CPE scores . In postmortem brains from HIV - positive people who died while on cART , higher ARV levels were associated with worse antemortem cognitive performance 74 . This association could result from HIV - induced systemic inflammation that leads to blood brain barrier compromise or from increased ARV neurotoxicity . Our human in vitro assays enable direct testing of ARVs for neurotoxicity , which is likely to be relevant to HAND pathology . While our assay used hiPSC - neurons in isolation , neurons coexist with glial cells like microglia and astrocytes in vivo , which impact their survival and function 75 and play key roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s 76 , 77 . A recently developed in vitro model enables testing for ARV neurotoxicity on co - cultured hiPSC - neurons , - microglia , and - astrocytes 78 in the presence or absence of HIV infection . In this system , efavirenz , a nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor linked to neuropsychiatric and cognitive effects 79 - 81 , increased inflammation and reduced phagocytosis in the hiPSC - microglia . Our hiPSC - neuron assay could be similarly expanded to include hiPSC - microglia and - astrocytes to test whether glia contribute to or protect against ARV - induced neuronal toxicity . This expanded system will also enable testing of the efficacy of ARVs to inhibit HIV infection of human microglia and the resulting inflammation 82 , 83 . Our assay of ARV effects in hNPCs indicated that TDF reduces viability in this cell type . TDF and zidovidine ( AZT ) reduce the viability of murine NPCs 84 , 85 , but to our knowledge this is the first report of ARV effects on human NPCs . TDF also altered the distribution of histone modifications in hNPCs , which may indicate that TDF affects hNPC differentiation . Because ARVs are prescribed as combinations of several drugs , it will be important to investigate such combinations for their epigenotoxic activity . DNA methylation , another epigenetic modification , has recently been reported to be altered in HIV + children receiving cART 86 . Given the importance of neurogenesis in neurodevelopment and maintenance of cognitive function during aging , it is critical to evaluate existing and candidate ARVs for effects on hNPC viability and epigenetics . In summary , we have developed and applied methods for the high throughput testing of HIV ARVs on hiPSC - neurons that model excitatory neurons of the human brain . Similar HCA and KIC methods have been applied to quantify neurotoxic effects of the breast cancer therapeutic tamoxifen in primary rat hippocampal neurons 50 , suggesting a broad applicability for these methods for neurotoxicity screening . We have also developed methods to screen for ARV effects on neurogenesis by quantifying the viability and epigenetics of hNPCs . Developing cART regimens that balance the neuroprotective effects of suppressing CNS HIV replication with potential ARV neurotoxicity remains a major challenge in HIV / AIDS treatment and drug discovery 87 - 89 . The results of the present study represent progress in this direction . Future studies will incorporate human glial cells ( hiPSC - microglia and hiPSC - astrocytes ) into our assay system to increase its power to detect neurotoxic and neurodevelopmental effects of existing and candidate anti - HIV therapeutics and to identify potential HAND therapeutics that can mitigate these effects .
