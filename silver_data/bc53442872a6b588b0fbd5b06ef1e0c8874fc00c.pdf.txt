Improving the Discoverability of Interactions in Interactive Systems Eva Mackamul Univ . Lille , Inria , CNRS , Centrale Lille , UMR 9189 CRIStAL Lille , France eva . mackamul @ inria . fr ABSTRACT In an ever increasingly complex technological landscape , interac - tion methods need to support users in their own discovery . This is exacerbated by a general aversion to instruction manuals and a trend towards invisible controls . Consequently , a lack of support for awareness or recognition of interaction possibilities leads to inefcient usage or complete disregard of the system . However , despite standard work imploring that users should be able to “fgure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them” , this problem is rarely considered in the introduction of new inter - action methods . My doctoral research is focused on improving the discovery of interaction possibilities . To do so I am combining a theoretical approach , focused on identifying , defning and framing relevant considerations with a practical approach to validate those theoretical considerations and identify and formulate actionable improvement methods for researchers and designers . In the process I hope to highlight the importance of discoverability to the research community and advocate for its increased consideration .

This is accompanied by HCI research proposing novel interaction techniques to utilise these expanding technical capabilities . Con - sequently , proposed interfaces and interaction methods have ex - panded beyond established WIMP or touch interactions . However , this abundance of possibilities is rarely fully utilised , as users are unaware of all the available functionalities and overburdened with discovering features and interaction methods through accidents , social examples and articles about “hidden tricks” [ 24 , 25 ] or “things you didn’t know” [ 4 , 29 , 34 ] rather than spontaneous interaction .

Examples of this can be found in commercial products ( iPhone 3D touch [ 11 ] ) as well as research [ 30 ] . Additionally , existing systems re - ceive constant software updates that not only update background functionality but , at times , also the user interface . If users don’t even realise they are presented with an interaction possibility , or if they don’t understand how to utilise it , they will not beneft from its introduction . Consequently , the lack of discov - erability of these novel interaction possibilities impedes successful usage or adoption of the technology altogether . Despite the clear problems caused by a lack of discoverability , introductions of new interactivity , both commercially and in research , rarely feature con - siderations of how new users are expected to become aware of and comprehend the new possibility . I hypothesise that this absence of consideration is not only due to a lack of awareness or acknowledgement of discoverability’s importance but also due to : • unclear and overlapping terminology used to describe the problem • lack of knowledge on how discovery can be facilitated and supported • lack of knowledge of how discovery occurs ( circumstance consideration ) • lack of established methodology to test whether something is discoverable My doctoral research is focused on flling these gaps in order to improve the discovery of interactions by providing a clear under - standing of the problem and ofering recommendations allowing its increased and systematic consideration . 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Given the objective of investigating and improving the discovery of interactions , my focus is on initial interactions which I use to describe the specifc circumstance of an interaction occurring for the very frst time , either intentional or by chance . This includes the frst encounter with , and discovery of , an overall system as well as its individual features and input methods . I explicitly consider these separate entities as such since their recognition and usage may be supported through difering means . In HCI these beginning phases of interaction have been primarily examined in the context of learning how to interact with the system . Consequently , learnability is the most commonly used term to de - scribe the users’ frst understanding and subsequent improvement when using an interactive system . Grossman et al . ’s survey of learnability research [ 12 ] found that , while there was an agreement among researchers that learnability CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Eva Mackamul is an important aspect of usability , there was a lack of consensus in the defnition , evaluation and improvement of learnability in user interfaces . They grouped defnitions into two main categories : initial learnability ( new users gaining profciency with a system ) and extended learnability ( long - term learning and mastering of a system ) . As they consider initial learnability as the ability to perform something well in a single interaction , the inception of interactions is a precondition inducing initial learnability . The separation of learnability into initial and extended illustrates the broad use of the term in both time frame and scope . Often mentioned in conjunction or synonymously with learn - ability is discoverability [ 8 , 15 , 21 ] . The term ’discoverability’ in the context of usability and human - computer interaction was pop - ularised by Norman [ 26 ] , who describes it through the following question : “Is it possible to even fgure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them ? ” [ 26 , p . 3 ] As such it describes a less purpose driven aspect of initial inter - action than learnability . Other ofered defnitions vary widely in scope and specifcity . While some ofer loose explanations of discoverability such as “the efort required to locate or “discover” an application amongst others” [ 14 ] or “the ability for users to fnd and execute features through a user interface” [ 15 ] , others defne discoverability specifcally for their context like noting how “the “invisible” nature of VUIs can challenge users’ ability to discover its capabilities and limitations” [ 8 ] or how gestural interfaces “are not discoverable in the sense that it is hard to know what gesture to do and we often cannot look it up in the way we would look at a menu to see what options are on it” [ 10 ] . Notably many of the ofered explanations of discoverability either allude to or directly reference learnability by referring to discoverability as “a means to achieve learnability” [ 8 ] or describing discoverability as a challenge one is confronted with when trying to learn a system [ 7 ] . Furthermore , defnitions of discoverability as , for example , “the ability with which a user can fnd features of the system to increase profciency over time” [ 27 ] resemble those ofered for learnability . This validates the notion that discoverability aids learnability and is a necessary component when aiming to achieve good learnability . However , this close association may be the cause for the lack of separate consideration of the concepts . 3 RESEARCH GOALS AND APPROACH The objective of my research is to establish a body of work on how to design systems that foster the discoverability of interaction possibilities . In doing so , I aim to improve the recognition and successful adoption of novel interaction methods upon their introduction as well as lower the entry threshold for advanced interactions with complex technology . To achieve this , the main objectives of my PhD are to ( 1 ) Clarify the concept of discoverability and highlight how semantically related concepts difer ( 2 ) Provide fundamental knowledge of factors impacting discov - erability ( 3 ) Establish and test interface design guidelines that support the discovery of interaction ( 4 ) Design and test user interface components supporting inde - pendent discovery of interaction possibilities ( 5 ) Defne experimental protocols for the evaluation of discov - erability Through these objectives , I hope to highlight the importance and potential of increased consideration of discoverability when introducing new interaction possibilities , while providing tools and guidelines on how to do so . To achieve these goals , I frst concentrated on the theoretical and conceptual work required to accomplish the frst two objec - tives . This is primarily to clearly defne the focus of my work and establish a conceptual basis of related concepts and relevant factors to base my practical work on . Additionally this ft the restrictions of beginning my PhD during the Covid 19 pandemic . 4 RESEARCH PROGRESS AND CONTRIBUTION TO DATE 4 . 1 Terminology Clarifcation Following an extensive literature review concerning the usage and defnition of discoverability , I identifed three focus areas of discov - erability in HCI : System , Interaction and Feature . System discov - erability is focused on whether potential users notice the overall system and recognise it as something they can interact with . Inter - action discoverability is concerned with whether users can identify and successfully use novel interaction and input methods . Finally , feature discoverability covers the user’s ability to discover features or functionality they were previously unaware of while using a system . While this separation between diferent discoverabilities has been implicit with research specifying a focus on interaction discoverability [ 3 ] or feature discoverability [ 31 ] , these focus areas have not been collated and considered in relation to one another . The clarifcation of what needs to be discovered is essential when examining the connection of diferent discoveries since they may not always be facilitated through the same measures . My under - standing of discoverability is informed by this separation and a combination of comprehensive defnitions from Cardello and Srini - vasan . Cardello describes discoverability as users encountering “new content or functionality that they were not aware of previously” [ 2 ] . Srinivasan et al . consider discoverability as entailing “ ( 1 ) aware - ness — making users aware of the operations that can be performed using speech ; and ( 2 ) understanding — educating users on how re - quests should be phrased so the system can interpret them correctly” [ 32 ] . Combining these approaches , I consider discoverability as the ability for users to perceive and comprehend a system , function or input method as such when encountering it for the frst time despite a lack of previous awareness or knowledge . This may be through intentional efort or serendipitously . To highlight the diferences between learnability and discov - erability , fgure 1 shows the approximate timeline of an isolated initial interaction . This isolation is for clarifcation purposes , how - ever initial interactions can happen continuously and concurrently as users encounter new interactivity within a system and during other interactions . Improving the Discoverability of Interactions in Interactive Systems CHI ’22 Extended Abstracts , April 29 - May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA I n t e n t i on a l I n t e r ac t i on S e r e nd i p i t ou s I n t e r ac t i on T i m e Initial Interaction Encounter End Interaction Discoverability Compre - hension ExtendedLearning Initial Learning Perception First SuccessfulInteraction Figure 1 : Timeline of progressing initial interaction . Both discoverability and learnability apply during this timeframe and infuence the interaction’s occurrence and success . While the diagram suggests a strict separation between serendipitous and intentional interaction , these commonly overlap . Although discoverability and learnability are each more applicable to the circumstance they are placed in , they are both applicable to either . Discoverability , since it covers users that may not have a partic - ular aim to interact and yet unaware of an interaction possibility , precedes learnability and triggers initial interaction . If a potential user encounters functionality but does not notice or comprehend it as such , the initial interaction is unlikely to continue . The initial in - teraction ends once the user frst successfully utilises the interaction possibility they are presented with . Therefore , the mere encounter with an interaction possibility is not yet an initial interaction if the user fails to successfully utilise it . Learnability exceeds discoverability both in scope and time frame . Even when examining just initial learnability , it extends past dis - coverability by incorporating the user being able to successfully interact with something . As Berkun notes , “discoverability does not guarantee success” [ 1 ] . He argues that simply being able to discover something , does not necessarily mean people can , or know how to , use it . Thus , discoverability is not a measure of efciency or improvement . In contrast learnability is often considered in the context of performance . While discoverability undoubtedly is a factor contributing to learnability , and both concepts infuence one another , these distinc - tions show that they should be considered independently before any conjoined examinations . Nonetheless , both are a phenomenon occurring during initial interactions and therefore infuenced by similar factors . 4 . 2 Conceptual Framework of Impacting Factors Investigating the factors infuencing and facilitating initial interac - tion is crucial to enable and improve discoverability , which often triggers these interactions . I examined literature focused on the frst stages of interaction and extracted relevant factors . To determine their impact on interac - tion and relation to one another I then reviewed literature specifc to these factors . The main concepts identifed can be categorised into three main actors : the system , the user and the environment . Through organising these factors and examining how factors within individual actors interrelate , I constructed a conceptual framework which is considered in depth in an ongoing submission . Figure 2 shows the separation of actors and some examples of factors that are considered within the context of that actor . 4 . 2 . 1 System . The factors considered within the system are sepa - rated into system characteristics and system qualities . The charac - teristics considered are visibility , consistency , constraints , signifers , feedback and feedforward as well as afordances . The frst three in - fuence the success of signifers and feedback / feedforward , while all of them convey the presence of afordances . System qualities are considered as such as they are inherently qualities of the system but describe interactivity and are therefore part of the interaction space . The considered qualities are communicability [ 5 , 28 ] , navigability , fndability [ 2 , 22 ] and guessability [ 35 ] . The framework collates defnitions for these , semantically related , terms and highlights diferences before considering how these concepts impact initial interaction . 4 . 2 . 2 User . Factors considered as part of the user include vari - ous dependencies . Familiarity enables both perceived afordances and expectations and assumptions , while goals and objectives enable motivation . The relation between attention and awareness is con - tentious with some arguing attention is necessary for awareness [ 6 , 19 ] while others question the necessity of attention for aware - ness [ 16 , 17 ] arguing that enhanced attention to specifc stimuli can come at the expense of overall awareness . Additionally to iden - tifying these factors , putting them in relation to one another and initial interactions and considering their impact , the framework also highlights how these factors contribute to endogenous triggers of interaction . Endogenous triggers focus on the users by themselves , and without outside infuence , discovering unfamiliar functionality or interactivity through a set of diferent circumstances .

Similarly , the presence of motivation infuences how interactions are triggered . Motivation can lead to intentional or curiosity driven interaction while in the absence of motivation interactions are only triggered through the user serendipitously or accidentally . 4 . 2 . 3 Environment . The environment in this context encapsulates the physical environment in which both , the system and the user , are placed , as well as the social context of this environment . The factors considered here are the social context , as well as exam - ples / instructions , distractions / interruptions and constraints . While independently infuencing interactions ( social learning [ 13 , 18 ] , technology adaptation [ 9 , 33 ] ) , the social context can also impact the other factors . Examples and Instructions originate through the social context and can infuence user behaviour . This is not only efective in co - located settings but also remote work settings [ 23 ] and advertisements such as keynotes [ 20 ] . Distractions and Inter - ruptions can stem from people in the space as well as general noise , light or other technology . Constraints can be environmental ( seman - tic and physical constraints e . g . bright light on a screen ) as well as imposed through the social context ( social and cultural constraints ) . Finally , the social context can be the trigger of initial interaction through examples , word of mouth or explicit instruction . 5 NEXT STEPS Having investigated the frst 2 research objectives through theoret - ical and conceptual work , the aim is to now validate the conceptual framework and extracted recommendations ( Research Objective 3 ) in practical application . To do so , I aim to design and test vari - ous approaches of creating user interface components that support independent discovery of their interaction possibilities . These ap - proaches will be informed by the considered factors and extracted guidelines . I then plan to consider their success or shortcomings strategically through the framework to identify which factors were leveraged to improve discovery and which oversights might have hindered it . The process of iteratively designing and testing dif - fering improvement approaches will inform the correction and expansion of guidelines provided for improvement of discovery of interactions . While , due to time constraints , objective 5 will not be addressed through a specifc scientifc contribution , projects aimed to address the other objectives will include evaluation for which I will iterate on existing study designs . My current work is focused on the frst identifed approach . My current ongoing work , the Touch Afordances project , is fo - cused on investigating whether real world metaphors can be used to communicate the presence of multiple input possibilities on one soft button . The aim is to bring attention to otherwise signifer - less activity without modifying the properties identifying the element as a button and communicating its purpose . Plans for following approaches to test , such as leveraging ani - mated transitions to convey otherwise hidden functionality , exist , but are not explicitly formulated in order to remain agile by al - lowing the inclusion of considerations arising through the current work , research and commercial releases or external feedback . 6 RESEARCH SITUATION I am pursuing my doctorate under the supervision of Sylvain Malacria and Géry Casiez as a part of LOKI , an Inria project - team in part - nership with the Université de Lille within the Joint Research Unit UMR 9189 CNRS - Centrale Lille - Université de Lille .
