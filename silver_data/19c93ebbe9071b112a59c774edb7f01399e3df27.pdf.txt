Here we present crystal structures comprising the tandem EF hand and carboxy terminal GTPase ( cGTPase ) domains of Drosophila Miro . The structures reveal two previously unidentified ‘hidden’ EF hands , each paired with a canonical EF hand . Each EF hand pair is bound to a helix that structurally mimics an EF hand ligand . A key nucleotide - sensing element and a Pink1 phosphorylation site both lie within an extensive EF hand – cGTPase interface .

Relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of these processes and a structural understanding of the relevant protein machinery is lacking . Miro is notable for its domain architecture , as it is one of very few proteins to contain both EF hand and GTPase domains . It consists of two GTPase domains that flank a central , Ca 2 þ - binding region containing two canonical EF hands [ 1 ] ( cEF hands ) ; a C - terminal transmembrane domain anchors Miro in the outer mitochondrial membrane [ 2 ] . Miro is essential for the axonal transport of mitochondria , as it attaches mitochondria to the microtubule - based motor protein kinesin - 1 through the cargo - adaptor protein Milton [ 3 – 5 ] . Its cEF hands permit Miro to act as a Ca 2 þ - dependent switch for mito - chondrial movement , allowing transport at low , basal cytosolic Ca 2 þ concentrations but stopping mitochondria at higher levels of Ca 2 þ [ 6 – 8 ] . The mechanism underlying this Ca 2 þ - dependent regulation is unclear [ 7 , 8 ] . The GTPase domains of Miro influence mitochondrial morphology [ 1 , 4 ] , and both EF hand and GTPase domains regulate endoplasmic reticulum—mitochondrial connections [ 9 , 10 ] . Miro is also a common substrate of the two Parkinson’s disease - related proteins Pink1 kinase and Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase in a signalling cascade that facilitates mitochondrial degradation [ 11 – 13 ] . Phosphorylation of Miro by Pink1 kinase and its subsequent Parkin - mediated degradation leads to mitophagy of damaged mitochondria [ 12 ] . While it is clear that Pink1 is a necessary component in this Miro – Pink1 – Parkin pathway , whether direct phosphorylation of Miro is required to trigger Parkin - mediated degradation is contested [ 12 , 13 ] . Here , we present the first crystal structures of Miro and offer insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Miro might regulate such a wide variety of mitochondrial functions . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overview of Miro structures We determined the crystal structures of a Drosophila Miro ( dMiro ) fragment containing the EF hands and C - terminal GTPase ( cGTPase ) domain ( Fig 1A ; referred to as MiroS ) in three states : apo ( apo - MiroS at 2 . 82A ˚ resolution ) , Ca 2 þ - bound ( Ca - MiroS at 2 . 80A˚ ) and magnesium ( Mg 2 þ ) and MgGDP - bound ( MgGDP - MiroS at 3 . 00A˚ ) . Supplementary Fig S1 online shows several views of the three structures , defined here as ‘side’ , ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ views . A ribbon diagram highlighting the Ca 2 þ and nucleotide - binding sites is shown in the ‘side view’ in Fig 1B . The structure consists of three distinct domains that form a compact molecule B 30 (cid:2) 40 (cid:2) 90A˚ .

Two linker regions follow a circuitous path across the ‘bottom’ of the molecule to join the three domains . Crystallographic data are presented in supplementary Table S1 online . Miro contains two EF hand pairs , such that each cEF hand is paired with a non - canonical ‘hidden’ EF hand [ 14 ] ( hEF hand ) that was not predicted by prior sequence analysis ( Fig . 1 ; cEF1 and hEF1 , cEF2 and hEF2 ) . The hEF hands adopt a typical helix – loop – helix EF hand motif and stabilize the adjacent cEF hands through an antiparallel EF hand b - scaffold [ 15 ] . Each of the EF hand pairs is followed by a helix that structurally mimics an EF hand ligand , which we term the ‘ligand mimic’ [ 16 ] ( LM ) ( Fig 1 ; LM1 and LM2 ) . Each of the two LM helices is followed by a linker ( Fig 1 ; Lnk1 and Lnk2 ) that enables a side - by - side orientation of the two cEF hands , positioning the EF hand pairs in - line with the cGTPase . The cGTPase exhibits a classic G - protein fold [ 17 ] comprising a six - stranded b - sheet core flanked by a - helices . An extensive interface between hEF2 and the cGTPase involves the nucleotide - responsive Switch I element , which is positioned away from the nucleotide - binding pocket in both the apo and MgGDP - bound structures . Sequence conservation between yeast , fly and human Miro suggests the linear arrangement of the two pseudosymmetric EF hand pairs and the cGTPase domain is likely to be a feature of all Miro proteins ( supplementary Fig S1 online ) . EF hand pair with ligand mimic domains The LM helices , buried at the base of the four helices forming each EF hand pair , are a striking feature of the Miro structure , structurally reminiscent of several well - known EF hand proteins bound to their ligands , such as the Troponin C / Troponin I [ 18 ] and myosin essential light chain – heavy chain [ 19 ] complexes ( supplementary Fig S2 online ) . Based on these comparisons , we refer to each Miro EF hand pair with LM helix arrangement as an ELM domain ( Fig 1 ; ELM1 and ELM2 ) . A handful of proteins contain ELM domains similar to Miro ( supplementary Fig S2 online ) . Miro’s two tandem ELM domains have similar folds , with 14 identical or similar residues at identical positions on the surface formed by the first ( a A ) and last ( a D ) helix of each EF hand pair ( Fig 2A ) . The two ELM domains themselves do not form an extensive interface , but both LM helices bury over 1 , 000A˚ 2 of surface area within their respective EF hand pairs , and the linkers that follow them contribute several key polar contacts to the interface . The long linkers permit an B 180 1 rotation of ELM2 with respect to ELM1 , such that the C - termini of the LM helices point directly at one another and the two highly similar a A / a D surfaces are on opposite faces of Miro ( Figs 1B and 2A ) . 201 617 1 652 nGTPase M cGTPase ELM1 ELM2 LM1 LM2 Lnk1 cEF1 hEF1 cEF2 hEF2 Lnk2 cGTPase N A B Crystallized Fig 1 | Domain architecture and structure of Miro .

Klosowiak et al scientific report 969 & 2013EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION EMBO reports VOL 14 | NO 11 | 2013 Although the two ELM domains appear to be structurally similar , they have markedly different hydrophobic cores . The core of ELM1 core encloses an B 442A˚ 3 cavity occupied in all of our structures by an unidentified ligand ( UNL ) . In contrast , the ELM2 core is tightly packed and includes three conserved tryptophan residues in very close proximity ( Fig 2B ; supplementary Fig S3 online ) . We observe Ca 2 þ or Mg 2 þ binding only to one EF hand site in the structures described here : cEF2 of ELM2 . However , both cEF hand loops show a classic EF hand loop architecture and harbour the conserved glutamate residue previously shown to be critical for Ca 2 þ - binding at cEF1 ( E234 ) and cEF2 ( E354 ) [ 7 , 20 ] ( Fig 3 ; supplementary Fig S4 online ) . The acidic residues of cEF2 co - ordinate Ca 2 þ in a classic pentagonal , bipyramidal fashion [ 15 ] , and Mg 2 þ - binding to cEF2 is readily accommodated by an octahedral coordination , as seen in other EF hands [ 21 ] ( Fig 3 ) . Unexpectedly , the overall fold of Miro is nearly identical in apo - MiroS , Ca - MiroS and MgGDP - MiroS ( rmsd o 0 . 7 A ˚ over 404 C a positions ) . The lack of Ca 2 þ or Mg 2 þ binding at cEF1 might be explained by the presence of the UNL at the core of ELM1 . The a B1 helix is displaced relative to a B2 to accommodate the UNL , resulting in a 1 . 0A˚ shift of E234 relative to E354 ( supplementary Fig S5 online ) . In contrast to the cEF hands , the two hEF hand loops are likely incapable of Ca 2 þ binding , as they lack the typical EF hand loop structure and the negatively charged residues that typically coordinate Ca 2 þ ( Fig 3 ) . EF hand / cGTPase interface The MiroS structures presented here are , to our knowledge , the first reported structures showing a direct EF hand – GTPase interaction . The interface is amphiphilic , with a total buried surface area of B 1 , 500A˚ 2 comprising three regions ( Fig 4A , insets 1 – 3 ) . In the first region , the hEF2 loop forms contacts with residues in and around Switch I of the cGTPase , including the Switch I threonine T481 . The second region involves interdigitating hydrophobic residues in a D2 and the cGTPase b - sheet . The third region comprises an extensive network of polar contacts that includes residues from linkers Lnk1 and Lnk2 and features a salt bridge between highly conserved residues R444 and D521 . Both nucleotide binding and Pink1 phosphorylation could potentially modulate the ELM2 / cGTPase interface of Miro . The Switch I threonine typically serves a g - phosphate - sensing role in GTPases [ 17 ] . Although dMiro T481 is not conserved , any g - phosphate - sensing mechanism enabling the Miro Switch I loop to access the nucleotide - binding pocket on MgGTP - binding would alter the first region of the ELM2 / cGTPase interface ( Fig 4 ) . A Pink1 phosphorylation site lies at the heart of the network of polar contacts in the third region of the ELM2 / cGTPase interface , in one of the three residues in Lnk1 ( S323 / S324 / T325 ) [ 12 ] . Of these residues , S324 is most conserved and forms a hydrogen bond with R444 in Lnk2 , coupling it to the cGTPase via the R444 / D521 salt bridge ( Fig 4A , inset 3 ) . Phosphorylation of S324 would likely disrupt this network of interactions . Pink1 phosphorylation has been shown to trigger Parkin - dependent degradation of Miro [ 12 ] . A recent report [ 22 ] has identified several Parkin ubiquitination sites in human Miro , four of which map onto our structure on the same face as the S324 Pink1 site ( Fig 5 ) . Together , these findings might have mechanistic implications for Pink1 - mediated recruitment of Parkin to the mitochondrial surface , a key step in the mitochondrial quality control pathway [ 23 ] . cGTPase structure is Ras - like The Miro cGTPase is most structurally similar to the Ras homologue Rheb [ 24 ] ( supplementary Fig S6 online ) . Both the N - terminal GTPase domain of Miro ( nGTPase ) and the cGTPase were originally classified as atypical Rho GTPases [ 1 ] , as they depart from the Rho - conserved DxxG Switch II motif [ 17 ] . The structure of the MgGDP – MiroS complex shows that the atypical cGTPase Switch II motif 503 DIDV 506 is intimately involved in MgGDP binding . Comparison of the apo and MgGDP - bound cGTPase structures reveals a concerted rearrange - ment of residues in and around the Switch II and P loop motifs ( Fig 4B ) . Upon MgGDP binding , Switch II undergoes a remarkable register shift that locks it into a b - strand conformation , extending the cGTPase b - sheet .

Solution studies of Miro We evaluated the structure of Miro in solution using small - angle x - ray scattering ( SAXS ) and size - exclusion chromatography in - line with multiangle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) . Radii of gyration ( Rg ) and ab initio molecular envelope reconstructions from SAXS experiments indicate that the overall structural shape of MiroS bound to Ca 2 þ in solution corroborates the crystallographic data . The MiroS Rg remains similar under apo or Mg 2 þ conditions ( Supplementary Figs S7 , S8 online ; Supplementary Table S2 online ) . The increased maximum diameter ( Dmax ) and Rg of MiroS - apo might indicate that Miro is less stably folded without Ca 2 þ , like several other EF hand proteins [ 14 , 21 ] . Notably , gross conformational rearrangements of MiroS into another stable form and / or oligomerization did not occur in the ion and nucleotide conditions tested . SEC - MALS shows that MiroS , and a longer Miro construct containing the nGTPase domain ( aa 1 - 617 , referred to as MiroL ) , are both monomers in solution regardless of Ca 2 þ concentration ( supplementary Fig S9 online ) , consistent with the SAXS data for MiroS . Additionally , the respective elution profiles for both MiroS and MiroL ± Ca 2 þ are superimposable , suggesting that the presence of the nGTPase does not greatly alter the behaviour of Miro in this assay . Taking these data together , neither MiroS nor MiroL appear to undergo a dramatic conformational rearrangement in response to Ca 2 þ . CONCLUSIONS One of the clearest functions of Miro is the arrest of kinesin - 1 - and dynein - dependent mitochondrial movement in response to elevated Ca 2 þ , a function that requires Ca 2 þ binding to the EF hands [ 8 ] . How do Miro’s ELM domains enable Ca 2 þ - induced mitochondrial arrest ? Although our structures illuminate Miro’s curious EF hand domain arrangement , the underlying mechanism is not yet readily apparent . Miro’s EF hand region is reminiscent of the Ca 2 þ - myristoyl switch protein recoverin [ 25 ] . However , the Ca 2 þ - induced structural changes that occur in recoverin [ 26 ] , and in more conventional EF hand proteins [ 15 ] , are in contrast with the minimal structural changes observed in our crystal and solution structures of Miro . Conformational changes in Miro might require the presence of an additional macromolecular binding partner , as seen in some other EF hand proteins [ 15 ] .

In the apo state , D505 in the Switch II 503 DIDV 506 motif is far from the nucleotide - binding pocket and is hydrogen bonded to R507 , which is also stabilized by interactions with P512 . In the MgGDP - bound state , the D505 side - chain rotates B 7A˚ to interact with the b - phosphate ( arrow ) , locking the Switch II loop in a b - strand conformation and extending G b 3 .

The pseudosymmetric ELM domains might facilitate associations between the Miro monomer and dimeric binding partners . An appealing hypothesis is that Ca 2 þ - binding primes Miro for interactions , permitting kinesin - 1 , for example , to bind Miro by displacing its LM helices , not unlike how rhodopsin kinase binds to recoverin by displacing its myristoylated N - terminal ‘LM’ helix [ 31 ] ( supplementary Fig S2 online ) . Thus , the compact , linear MiroS conformation we have captured here likely reflects one key state of Miro , modulated by Ca 2 þ , nucleotide and phosphorylation - dependent regulation in the context of mitochondrial function in the cell . METHODS Crystallography . The dMiro 1 – 617 - 6xHis isoform D ( MiroL ) was purified as described previously [ 12 ] . dMiro 201 – 617 - 6xHis isoform D ( MiroS ) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel - affinity and cation - exchange chromatography at 4 1 C . Crystals were grown using the sitting - drop vapour diffusion method at 21 1 C . Optimized conditions included 25mM HEPES , 0 . 5M NaCl , 0 . 5mM TCEP , 1 . 5 – 1 . 9M LiSO 4 , 0 . 1 – 0 . 2M Bis - Tris at pH 7 . 4 – 8 . 0 , 5mM EGTA and 4 . 5 – 10 . 8 mg / ml protein . Ca - MiroS and MgGDP - MiroS crystals were subject to CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 þ GDP soaks for B 72h , respectively , before flash freezing directly in mother liquor ( see supplementary Methods online ) . Diffraction data were measured at LS - CAT , Sector 21 of the Advanced Photon Source ( APS ) in the Argonne National Laboratory with an x - ray wavelength of 0 . 97872A˚ . Data from two isomorphous selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - labelled crystals were merged , and phasing by single wavelength anomalous dispersion was carried out using Phenix . An initial model obtained using Phenix AutoBuild comprised 375 of an expected 417 residues and revealed the overall domain structure . After initial refinement , the selenomethionine structure was used as a search model in Phaser to obtain by molecular replacement the apo - MiroS , Ca - MiroS , and MgGDP - MiroS structures described here . SAXS . Solution SAXS experiments were performed at BioCAT , beamline 18 - ID - B at Sector 18 of the APS in the Argonne National Laboratory . MiroS solutions at 1 . 0 mg / ml in SAXS buffer ( 25mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 , 300mM NaCl , 0 . 5mM TCEP ) supplemented with either EGTA , MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , GDP and / or GTP were loaded into a capillary as a total of 20 exposures were measured ( see supplementary Methods online ) . Buffer solutions matched to each Miro sample were measured in the same capillary before each experimental run . Images from buffer and sample sets were radially binned to obtain I versus q curves . Curves from each set were averaged and the resulting buffer curve was subtracted from the sample curve . The Rg was determined by Guinier analysis . Where possible , the particle distribution function P ( r ) was determined using the programme GNOM to confirm the Rg and to determine Dmax . Scattering data of apo - MiroS and MiroS in the presence of Mg 2 þ but not Ca 2 þ or nucleotide showed evidence of some unfolded and / or aggregated protein in the high and low Q range of the scattering curves . While these data were of sufficient quality to obtain Rg or Dmax , they were not used for SAXS reconstructions . Dummy atom modelling for SAXS reconstructions was done with the programme DAMMIF .
