Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation : Evidence from the Human Genome Heidi L . Williams Massachusetts Institute of Technology and National Bureau of Economic Research Do intellectual property ð IP Þ rights on existing technologies hinder subsequent innovation ? Using newly collected data on the sequencing of the human genome by the public Human Genome Project and the private ﬁrm Celera , this paper estimates the impact of Celera’s gene - level IP on subsequent innovation . Across a range of empirical speci - ﬁcations , I document evidence that Celera’s IP led to reductions in subsequent scientiﬁc research and product development on the order of 20 – 30 percent . These results suggest that Celera’s short - term IP had persistent negative effects on subsequent innovation relative to a coun - terfactual of Celera genes having always been in the public domain . Innovation is a key driver of economic growth , but competitive markets may under - incentivize innovation because of the public - good nature of ideas ð Nelson 1959 ; Arrow 1962 Þ .

However , in many markets techno - logical change is cumulative , in the sense that product development results from several steps of invention and research . In markets in which innovation is cumulative , the overall effectiveness of IP in promoting in - novation also depends on a second , less studied question : do IP rights on existing technologies hinder subsequent innovation ? The contribution of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on this second question by investigating how one form of IP on the human genome inﬂuenced sub - sequent scientiﬁc research and product development . To ﬁx ideas , suppose that the ﬁrm Celera holds IP on a human gene and that Pﬁzer discovers a genetic diagnostic test based on Celera’s gene . Will Celera’s IP discourage Pﬁzer from developing this test ? In a perfect contracting environment with no transaction costs , Celera and Pﬁzer would negotiate a licensing agreement such that cumulative research is not hindered . However , transaction costs may cause licens - ing negotiations to break down , deterring some socially desirable re - search . While the theoretical literature on this question is well developed ð Scotchmer 1991 ; Green and Scotchmer 1995 ; Bessen 2004 Þ , empirical evidence is scarce . The empirical context analyzed in this paper is the sequencing of the human genome by the public Human Genome Project and the private ﬁrm Celera . The public effort began in 1990 and required that all se - quenced genes be placed in the public domain . Celera’s effort began in 1999 and ended in 2001 when Celera disclosed an incomplete draft genome . The public effort continued and by 2003 had sequenced all genes in Celera’s 2001 draft . Between 2001 and 2003 , Celera used a contract law – based form of IP to protect genes sequenced by Celera but not yet sequenced by the public effort . This IP enabled Celera to sell its data for substantial fees and required ﬁrms to negotiate licensing agree - ments with Celera for any resulting commercial discoveries , even though it was publicly known at the time that all of Celera’s genes would be sequenced by the public effort , and thus be in the public domain , by 2003 . Figure 1 summarizes a time line of these key events . How did Celera’s gene - level IP inﬂuence subsequent scientiﬁc re - search and product development ? To investigate this question , I construct a new data set that tracks the timing of gene sequencing and Celera’s IP across the human genome , linked to gene - level measures of scientiﬁc re - search and product development . Speciﬁcally , I trace cumulative innova - tion by compiling data on links between genes and phenotypes , which are observable traits or characteristics . For example , the link between varia - tion on the HTT gene and Huntington’s disease represents a genotype - phenotype link . For each gene , I collect data on publications investigating genotype - phenotype links , on successfully generated knowledge about 2 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions genotype - phenotype links , and on the development of gene - based diag - nostic tests available to consumers . 1 A simple cross - tabulation illustrates how these data can be used to investigate how Celera’s IP inﬂuenced subsequent innovation . Table 1 compares subsequent innovation outcomes for Celera genes relative to non - Celera genes sequenced in the same year . Taken at face value , these data suggest that Celera’s IP led to economically and statistically signif - icant reductions in subsequent scientiﬁc research and product devel - opment . Celera genes had an average of 1 . 2 publications by 2009 , rela - tive to 2 . 1 publications for non - Celera genes sequenced in the same year . About 3 percent of Celera genes were used in a gene - based diagnostic test as of 2009 , relative to 5 . 4 percent of non - Celera genes sequenced in the same year . These simple differences in means could reﬂect a negative effect of Celera’s IP on subsequent research or could reﬂect that Celera’s genes had lower inherent potential for follow - on research . Because the insti - tutional context suggests that selection bias could be a concern , I pre - sent estimates from two additional empirical tests that directly address selection . First , I restrict attention to within - gene variation in IP and test whether the removal of Celera’s IP increased subsequent innovation . Second , I limit the sample to Celera genes and test for a link between the amount of time a gene was held with Celera’s IP and subsequent inno - F IG . 1 . — Time line of key events . This ﬁgure summarizes the key events analyzed in this paper .

However , by construction , patent citations cannot measure cumulative innovation on nonpatented technologies . The type of data constructed in this paper — measuring scientiﬁc research and product development directly rather than via patent citations — is critical in enabling a test of how IP affects cumulative innovation . intellectual property rights and innovation 3 This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions vation . These additional empirical tests appear to eliminate selection bias in the following sense : within the sample of ∼ 1 , 600 Celera genes , proxies for the ex ante expected value of a gene do not predict the timing of when genes were resequenced by the public effort . The estimates from these two additional empirical tests have roughly the same magnitude as the estimates from the simple cross - tabulation : Celera’s IP appears to have generated economically and statistically signiﬁcant reductions in subsequent scientiﬁc research and product development , on the order of 20 – 30 percent . This analysis does not evaluate the overall welfare consequences of Celera’s entry , which may have been spurred by the prospect of obtaining IP . If Celera’s entry spurred faster sequencing of the human genome , the overall timing of genome - related innovation likely shifted earlier in time , which would have had welfare gains even if Celera’s IP in isolation hin - dered innovation . Rather , these results suggest that , with Celera’s entry held constant , an alternative lump - sum reward mechanism may have had social beneﬁts relative to Celera’s chosen form of IP . 2 This paper joins a handful of recent papers documenting evidence that IP may hinder subsequent innovation ð Murray and Stern 2007 ; Murray et al . 2008 ; Huang and Murray 2009 Þ . Of particular note is the work of Murray et al . , who analyze short - term IP the ﬁrm DuPont held on certain types of genetically engineered mice . Using a data set of matched mouse - article pairs , the authors document that the removal of IP increased citations to scientiﬁc papers on affected mice by 20 – 40 per - 2 For example , under the patent buyout mechanism discussed by Kremer ð 1998 Þ , the public sector ð or another entity Þ could have paid Celera some fee to “buy out” Celera’s IP and place Celera genes in the public domain . See Kremer and Williams ð 2010 Þ for further discussion of other alternative mechanisms for rewarding innovation .

Section I provides a brief scientiﬁc back - ground and a description of my data construction . Section II describes the empirical context , and Section III presents the empirical results . Section IV links the empirical results back to previous theoretical and empirical analyses , in an attempt to interpret which types of transaction costs were likely most important in this context . Section V presents con - cluding remarks . I . Preliminaries : Scientiﬁc Primer and Data Construction This section provides a brief scientiﬁc background and describes my data construction . Online Appendix A discusses my data construction in more detail . A . Scientiﬁc Primer In classical genetics , a gene is deﬁned as a unit of inheritance . Physically , a gene is deﬁned as a stretch of deoxyribonucleic acid ð DNA Þ , which it - self is a sequence composed of four nucleotide bases : adenine ð A Þ , cyto - sine ð C Þ , guanine ð G Þ , and thymine ð T Þ . 4 “Sequencing the genome” refers to the process of determining the exact order of these nucleotide bases in the entire set of hereditary information for a given organism . Genes affect health by generating proteins , which carry out functions in the human body . More precisely , genes code for messenger ribonu - cleic acids ð mRNAs Þ : a gene’s sequence of nucleotide bases dictates the sequence of nucleotide bases in a generated mRNA . In turn , mRNAs code for proteins : an mRNA’s sequence of nucleotide bases dictates what protein is generated . The intermediate step — mRNA — is important be - cause a gene can code multiple proteins by coding multiple mRNAs . Re - flecting this , sequencing the genome involved sequencing mRNAs . Proteins induce variation in observable traits or characteristics of an organism , known as phenotypes . Known genotype - phenotype links can be combined with sequenced genes to form the basis for genetic tests . A gene can be involved in multiple genotype - phenotype links , and a genotype - phenotype link can involve more than one gene . 3 Murray et al . ð 2008 Þ also provide evidence , consistent with the model of Aghion , De - watripont , and Stein ð 2008 Þ , that IP reduces the diversity of scientiﬁc experimentation . 4 In recent years the exact deﬁnition of a gene has become more complicated than this basic description ; for a more detailed discussion , see Snyder and Gerstein ð 2003 Þ . However , these subtleties are not important for the empirical analysis in this paper ; my use of the term “gene” follows the deﬁnitions set out in the US National Institutes of Health’s RefSeq database , which is used internationally as the standard for genome annotation . intellectual property rights and innovation 5 This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions I use genes as my unit of analysis . Genes are stable scientiﬁc units , whereas the number of known mRNAs and known genotype - phenotype links in part reﬂects the amount of research invested in a given gene . Table 2 presents summary statistics on the gene - level data . My data in - clude 27 , 882 currently known genes . The median length of a gene is around 17 , 000 nucleotide bases ð Scherer 2008 Þ . B . Tracking the Public and Private Genome Sequencing Efforts I track the timing of the public sequencing effort using data from the US National Institutes of Health’s RefSeq database . I deﬁne the year a gene was sequenced as the ﬁrst year any mRNA was disclosed for that gene . The median gene was sequenced in 2001 ð panel A of table 2 Þ . 5 Istrail et al . ð 2004 Þ compare Celera’s 2001 draft genome with a snap - shot of the public data . Building on their analysis , I am able to deter - mine which genes were included in Celera’s 2001 draft genome and the dates at which those genes eventually appeared in the public data . I deﬁne a Celera gene as a gene for which all known mRNAs were initially se - quenced by Celera . 6 Of the 27 , 882 currently known genes , 1 , 682 — about 6 percent — were held with Celera’s IP for some amount of time ð panel A of table 2 Þ . Because Celera’s draft genome was disclosed in 2001 , I code Celera genes as having been sequenced in 2001 .

Gene - level observations . Note that the mean year of disclosure is affected by left - censoring since a disclosure year of 1999 represents a gene sequenced in or before 1999 ð 1999 is the earliest year any observations appear in the RefSeq database Þ . See the text and online App . A for more detailed data and variable descriptions . 5 The mean for this variable is left - censored because 1999 is the ﬁrst year coded in the RefSeq database . 6 The mean number of known mRNAs per gene is 1 . 67 , and the median is 1 . Thus , alternative deﬁnitions — such as the share of known mRNAs that were Celera mRNAs or an indicator for whether any mRNA on the gene was a Celera mRNA — are identical for the majority of genes . 6 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions C . Measuring Scientiﬁc Research and Product Development Outcomes I collect four outcome variables : three measures of scientiﬁc research and one measure of product development . My measures of scientiﬁc research are drawn from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ð OMIM Þ data - base , which aims to provide a comprehensive set of genotype - phenotype records . OMIM entries are annotated with citations to published scien - tiﬁc papers . From these annotations , I collect data on the number of publications related to each gene in each year . I use publications from 2001 to 2009 as an outcome ; on average , genes had two publications over that period , with a median of zero ð panel B of table 2 Þ . OMIM assigns two classiﬁcations , which I use as proxies for the level of scientiﬁc knowledge about genotype - phenotype links . All genes involved in at least one genotype - phenotype link classiﬁed by OMIM as meeting a high level of scientiﬁc certainty are coded as having a “known , certain phenotype . ” The set of genes classiﬁed by OMIM as meeting a lower threshold for scientiﬁc certainty ð including those meeting the higher threshold Þ are coded as having a “known , uncertain phenotype . ” I ob - serve the former measure as of 2009 and the latter measure annually . As of 2009 , 45 percent of genes have a known , uncertain phenotype link and 8 percent have a known , certain phenotype link ð panel B of table 2 Þ . My measure of product development is drawn from GeneTests . org , a self - reported , voluntary listing of US and international laboratories of - fering genetic testing . Although not comprehensive , GeneTests . org is the most frequently referenced genetic testing directory ð Uhlmann and Guttmacher 2008 Þ . I construct an indicator for whether each gene is used in any genetic test as of 2009 . As of 2009 , 6 percent of genes were used in a genetic test ð panel B of table 2 Þ . 7 D . Data Construction : An Example A brief example may help to clarify my data construction . The mRNA NM _ 032753 . 3 ﬁrst appeared in RefSeq in 2001 and was never held with Celera’s IP . This is the only known mRNA for the RAX2 gene . I deﬁne RAX2 as sequenced in 2001 and never held by Celera . OMIM references RAX2 in two genotype - phenotypes , ﬁrst appearing in 2006 . Both reference a 2004 publication in Human Molecular Genetics and are classiﬁed by OMIM as known , certain phenotypes . First , RAX2 is linked to age - related macular degeneration , a medical condition arising in older adults that destroys the type of central vision needed for com - mon tasks such as driving , facial recognition , and reading . Second , RAX2 7 These tests can be developed quite quickly ; Cho et al . ð 2003 Þ note that it may take only weeks or months to go from a research ﬁnding that a particular genetic variant is associ - ated with a disease to a clinically validated test . intellectual property rights and innovation 7 This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions is linked to cone - rod dystrophy , an eye disease tending to cause vision loss . I deﬁne RAX2 as having one publication in 2004 ; in a known , un - certain phenotype link as of 2006 ; and in a known , certain phenotype link as of 2009 . 8 GeneTests . org lists several testing facilities offering a genetic test for RAX2’s link to age - related macular degeneration ð including some aca - demic medical centers as well as the for - proﬁt ﬁrm Quest Diagnostics Þ . There are no listings for genetic tests for RAX2’s link to cone - rod dys - trophy . I deﬁne RAX2 as being used in a diagnostic test as of 2009 . E . Linking Scientiﬁc Research and Product Development The prior empirical literature investigating how IP affects subsequent innovation has been constrained to examine only publication - related outcome variables , whereas in this paper I am able to trace how IP affected the availability of commercial products . A priori , this distinction is im - portant : if academic and public researchers face higher incentives to disclose the results of their research than private researchers do and if IP induces an increase in the share of research done by private researchers , then observed differences in publications could in part be explained by differences in disclosure . 9 However , my product development outcome — diagnostic test availability — should be invariant with respect to disclosure preferences of researchers . Panel A of ﬁgure 2 presents one set of descriptive statistics illustrat - ing that , in my data , scientiﬁc research and product development are strongly related . The dashed line ð no test as of 2009 Þ plots the empirical cumulative distribution function of the number of publications between 1970 and 2000 for genes that do not have a diagnostic test available as of 2009 . 10 The solid line ð test as of 2009 Þ plots the empirical cumulative distribution function of the number of publications between 1970 and 2000 for genes that do have a diagnostic test available as of 2009 . Virtually all genes not used in diagnostic tests had 10 or fewer publications , whereas about 70 percent of genes used in diagnostic tests had more than 10 pub - lications . Panel B of ﬁgure 2 presents an alternative set of descriptive statistics illustrating a similar point . The dashed line plots the distribution of genes , ordered by the number of publications between 1970 and 2000 ; 8 As detailed above , I observe the known , certain phenotype measure only as of 2009 . 9 Of course , disclosure itself presumably has social value , and to the extent that IP induces reductions in disclosure , this effect is also relevant in measuring the welfare effects of IP . Moon ð 2011 Þ provides an empirical study of disclosure in the context of genetic research . Analyzing the discovery of a genotype - phenotype link in an event study frame - work , he shows that nonacademic research organizations become less likely to publish relative to universities after the discovery of a phenotype link . 10 There are very few pre - 1970 publications cited in the OMIM data . 8 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions F IG . 2 . — Documenting the link between scientiﬁc research and product development . These ﬁgures provide two sets of descriptive statistics that document the link between scientiﬁc research and product development in my data . In panel A , the dashed line plots the empirical cumulative distribution function of the number of publications between 1970 and 2000 for genes that do not have a diagnostic test available as of 2009 , and the solid line plots the empirical cumulative distribution function of the number of publica - tions between 1970 and 2000 for genes that do have a diagnostic test available as of 2009 . In panel B , the dashed line plots the distribution of genes by the number of publications between 1970 and 2000 , and the solid line plots the share of genes with a diagnostic test as of 2009 at each number of publications .

This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions consistent with the summary statistics presented in table 2 , most genes have zero publications . The solid line plots the share of genes with a diagnostic test for each number of publications . The share of genes with a diagnostic test increases roughly monotonically with the number of publications between zero and around 30 publications and then con - tinues to increase more slowly above that point . These data suggest that the number of publications is strongly related to the probability that a diagnostic test is available . II . Empirical Context This section brieﬂy reviews the institutional context relevant for the em - pirical analysis . 11 A . Time Line of Sequencing Efforts The public sequencing effort — the Human Genome Project — was launched in 1990 and originally aimed to ﬁnish sequencing the entire genome by 2005 ð Collins and Galas 1993 Þ . In May 1998 , Celera — a new ﬁrm led by scientist Craig Venter — formed with the intention of se - quencing the entire human genome within 3 years ð Collins et al . 1998 Þ . The public effort subsequently announced a revised plan to complete its sequencing efforts by 2003 ð Venter et al . 1998 Þ and to release an earlier “draft” sequence of the human genome ð Pennisi 1999 Þ . 12 Departing from its previous goal of producing a near - perfect sequence , the aim of this draft sequence was to place most of the genome in the public domain as soon as possible . The two efforts jointly published draft genomes in February 2001 , the public effort in Nature ð Lander et al . 2001 Þ and Celera in Science ð Venter et al . 2001 Þ . 13 Celera’s sequencing effort stopped with this publication , whereas the public effort continued and was declared complete in April 2003 ð Wade 2003 Þ . B . Intellectual Property : The Bermuda Rules and Celera’s IP As of 1996 , genes sequenced by the public effort were covered by the “Bermuda rules , ” requiring data to be posted on an open - access website within 24 hours of sequencing . 14 The stated goal was “to encourage 11 For more details , see Cook - Deegan ð 1994 Þ , Sulston and Ferry ð 2002 Þ , Shreeve ð 2005 Þ , and Venter ð 2007 Þ . 12 Many observers attribute this scale - up to Celera’s entry ð Marshall 1998 Þ . 13 Celera and a few “early subscriber” ﬁrms had access to intermediate data updates during late 1999 and 2000 , but my understanding is that the vast majority of Celera’s data were ﬁrst released in the 2001 draft genome . 14 In 1996 , the heads of the largest labs involved in the public effort agreed at a Bermuda - basedmeetingtotheserulesasasetofguidelinesfordatasequencedunderthepubliceffort . The Bermuda rules replaced a US policy that data be made available within 6 months ð Marshall 2001 Þ . 10 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions research and development and to maximize ½ the data’s (cid:2) beneﬁt to so - ciety . ” 15 Eisenberg ð 2000 Þ argues that the Bermuda rules also aimed to discourage gene patenting . Between 2001 and 2003 , Celera used a contract law – based form of IP to protect genes that had been sequenced by Celera but not yet se - quenced by the public effort . Celera’s IP had several key features . 16 First , Celera’s data were “disclosed” in 2001 ð Venter et al . 2001 Þ in the sense that any individual could view data on the assembled genome through Celera’s website or by obtaining a free data DVD from the company . 17 Academic researchers were free to use Celera’s data for noncommer - cial research and academic publications . Second , by placing restrictions on redistribution , Celera was able to sell its data to larger institutions — including pharmaceutical companies , universities , and research insti - tutes . Although the terms of speciﬁc deals were private , Service ð 2001 Þ reports that pharmaceutical companies were paying between $ 5 million and $ 15 million a year , whereas universities and nonproﬁt research or - ganizations were paying between $ 7 , 500 and $ 15 , 000 for each lab given access to the data . Third , any researcher wanting to use the data for commercial purposes was required to negotiate a licensing agreement with Celera . Celera was able to charge these data access and licensing fees even though all available accounts suggest it was publicly known in 2001 that all of Celera’s genes would be resequenced by the public effort , and thus move into the public domain , by 2003 . Shreeve ð 2005 , 205 Þ quotes Craig Venter as saying , “Amgen , Novartis , and now Phar - macia Upjohn have signed up knowing damn well the data was going to be in the public domain in two years anyways . They didn’t want to wait for it . ” In addition to this short - term IP , Shreeve documents that Celera was actively pursuing gene patent applications for genes in its database ; ex post , most of these applications were not granted patents , but given the contemporaneous and subsequent policy uncertainty surrounding gene patenting , it is difﬁcult to know what researchers’ expectations were at the time . 18 Beyond database sales and licensing revenues , Celera’s busi - ness model also included in - house research and proﬁts from genes granted 15 These rules are described in various policy statements by the US National Human Genome Research Institute ð 1996 Þ . Nonadherence was expected to result in black marks on future grant reviews ð Marshall 2001 Þ . 16 For details , see Celera’s data access agreement ð Science Online 2001 Þ and Celera’s DVD user agreement . I am very grateful to Mike Meurer , Robert Millman ð then – chief IP counsel at Celera from 1999 to 2002 Þ , and Ben Roin for discussions on Celera’s IP , but of course none of them is responsible for any errors in my descriptions . 17 Viewing the data or obtaining the DVD required agreeing not to commercialize or redistribute the data . 18 What the US Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce has allowed to be covered by a “gene patent” has changed dramatically over time ; see , e . g . National Academy of Sciences ð 2006 Þ . There has also been substantial variation over time in the judicial enforcement of existing gene patents . intellectual property rights and innovation 11 This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions patents ð Service 2001 Þ . Celera eventually grew into a health care ﬁrm that develops and manufactures gene - based technologies . C . Sequencing Strategies : Implications for Selection into Celera’s IP The public sequencing effort was a large consortium that , for the pur - poses of this paper , can be conceptualized as two distinct efforts : a “tar - geted” effort focused on sequencing genes with known medical value , such as the gene linked to Huntington’s disease , and a “large - scale” effort focused on the same type of large - scale sequencing undertaken by Celera . Large - scale sequencing by both Celera and the public effort re - lied on the shotgun sequencing method , in which DNA is randomly broken up into small segments that are sequenced and reassembled ð Lander et al . 2001 Þ . From an empirical perspective , shotgun sequencing should have introduced some effectively random variation in whether genes were initially sequenced by Celera or by the public effort . The vast majority of genes were sequenced under the large - scale pub - lic effort , which started in mid - 1999 ð Lander et al . 2001 Þ . However , be - cause the targeted public effort focused on sequencing genes that had high ex ante expected medical value , we expect that Celera genes — on average — will be negatively selected in the sense of having a lower in - herent potential for follow - on research . This selection is important be - cause it implies that the simple cross - tabulation presented in table 1 could be misleading . This concern motivates the construction of em - pirical measures that proxy for the ex ante expected value of each gene in order to empirically investigate patterns of selection in my data . On the basis of discussions with scientists , one reasonable proxy for the ex ante expected value of a gene is the number of scientiﬁc papers published about the gene before it was sequenced . For example , a long scientiﬁc literature has documented evidence that Huntington’s disease has a genetic basis . Many of these papers were published prior to the development of gene sequencing techniques , and the evidence from these papers likely led scientists to target the sequencing of genes re - lated to Huntington’s disease more than genes related to conditions that were less well understood . Figure 3 uses data on the number of OMIM publications about a gene from 1970 to 2000 to investigate selection into Celera’s IP . The solid line ð all genes Þ plots the difference in mean publications on Celera genes and mean publications on non - Celera genes in each year from 1970 to 2000 . All observations are less than zero , providing empirical evidence consistent with the type of selection I described : genes initially se - quenced by the public effort had higher ex ante expected value than genes initially sequenced by Celera . One formal test for such selection is to use an ordinary least squares ð OLS Þ model to predict the gene - level 12 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions celera indicator as a function of count variables for publications in each year from 1970 to 2000 . In the full sample , the p - value from an F - test for joint signiﬁcance is less than . 001 . Unfortunately , I do not observe which genes were sequenced by the targeted public effort , so I cannot directly exclude those genes from the sample . As an alternative , I limit the comparison group of non - Celera genes to those sequenced in 2001 ð the year Celera’s draft genome was disclosed Þ . Because the number of genes sequenced under the targeted public effort was likely small in 2001 relative to the number of genes sequenced under the large - scale effort , selection should be reduced in this sample . The dashed line in ﬁgure 3 ð genes sequenced in 2001 Þ suggests that this sample restriction reduces but does not eliminate ob - served selection . In this restricted sample , the p - value from an F - test for joint signiﬁcance is . 033 .

The dotted line in ﬁgure 3 ð Celera genes Þ plots the difference in mean publications on Celera genes resequenced in 2003 and mean publications on Celera genes resequenced in 2002 , in each year from 1970 to 2000 .

This result suggests that , after 2001 , the public effort was either not targeting or not successfully targeting the resequencing of more valuable Celera genes . This evidence sup - ports the validity of my second and third empirical tests . III . Empirical Results A . Cross - Section Estimates The basic comparison underlying my cross - section estimates can be a presented in a simple cross - tabulation . Table 1 compares subsequent innovation outcomes for Celera genes and for non - Celera genes se - quenced in 2001 . These data suggest that Celera genes have lower levels of subsequent scientiﬁc research and product development relative to non - Celera genes sequenced in the same year . For example , about 3 per - cent of Celera genes were used in a gene - based diagnostic test in 2009 , relative to 5 . 4 percent of non - Celera genes sequenced in the same year . The concern with interpreting these simple differences in means is that they could reﬂect a negative effect of Celera’s IP on subsequent research or could instead reﬂect selection if Celera’s genes had lower inherent potential for follow - on research . In order to address this con - cern , table 3 formalizes the basic comparison from table 1 in a regression framework that allows me to investigate the robustness of these patterns . For gene g , I estimate the following : ð outcome Þ g 5 a 1 b ð celera Þ g 1 l 0 ð covariates Þ g 1 ε g : The coefﬁcient on the celera variable is the main estimate of interest . I show estimates from OLS models and report heteroskedasticity - robust standard errors . 19 19 As a robustness check , in online App . table B1 , I present estimates from proportional models that are analogous to the estimates in table 3 : quasi – maximum likelihood Poisson models for publications and logit models for the three binary outcomes . 14 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Column 1 of table 3 replicates the cross - tabulation results on the full sample , controlling for year of disclosure but no other covariates . 20 Col - umn 2 of table 3 includes a set of count variables for the number of 20 There are two ways to control for variation in innovation outcomes across genes as of 2009 that is a function of the year in which the genes were sequenced : limiting the sample to the set of genes sequenced in 2001 or using the full sample but including indicator variables to control for year of disclosure . Because all Celera genes were sequenced in 2001 , the celera variable varies only in 2001 . Hence , reestimating the speciﬁcation in col . 1 on the subsample of genes sequenced in 2001 estimates identical coefﬁcients . I use the full sample in these robustness checks because the additional non - Celera genes are useful for identi - fying the covariates .

We saw in Section II . C that Celera genes looked less valuable than non - Celera genes on the basis of these proxies for ex ante expected value . As expected , including these variables as covariates reduces the magnitudes of the point estimates . Column 3 limits the sample to genes with nonmissing data on location variables ð n 5 16 ; 485 Þ and investigates whether the estimates are sensitive to conditioning on detailed location variables . This robustness check addresses the possibility that scientists may have targeted their sequencing efforts on the basis of a gene’s ex ante known location on the genome . For example , certain chromosomes ð such as chromosome 19 Þ were estimated to be more “gene rich” than others , and scientists may have targeted the sequencing of such chromosomes . To test for this possibility , I collect detailed variables on both types of gene location descriptors used by geneticists ð cytogenetic location and molecular location Þ . The estimates in column 3 are quite similar in mag - nitude to the estimates in column 2 . For brevity , I focus on interpreting the magnitudes of the point esti - mates in column 1 . The estimate in panel A implies that Celera genes had about 0 . 88 fewer publications from 2001 to 2009 , a decline on the order of 40 percent of the mean number of publications for genes over that time period . The estimate in panel B implies a 16 percentage point reduction in the probability of having a known , uncertain phenotype link , a decline on the order of 35 percent relative to the sample mean . The estimate in panel C implies a 2 . 7 percentage point reduction in the probability of having a known , certain phenotype link , a decline on the order of 33 percent of the sample mean . The estimate in panel D im - plies a 2 . 3 percentage point reduction in the probability of a gene being used in any currently available diagnostic test , a decline on the order of 38 percent of the sample mean . One way to interpret the magnitudes of these differences in means is the following : if Celera genes had coun - terfactually had the same rate of subsequent innovation as non - Celera genes , there would have been 1 , 400 additional publications between 2001 and 2009 and 40 additional diagnostic tests as of 2009 . 21 The esti - 21 I calculated these ﬁgures using non - Celera genes sequenced in 2001 as my counter - factual , as in table 1 , as follows . Between 2001 and 2009 , there were 8 , 118 publications on the cohort of genes sequenced in 2001 , with an average of 2 . 116 publications for non - Celera genes and an average of 1 . 239 publications for Celera genes . If we assume that Celera genes had attained the non - Celera average number of publications , there would instead have been 9 , 592 publications . Hence , Celera’s IP led to around 1 , 400 fewer pub - lications between 2001 and 2009 ð 9 , 592 2 8 , 118 ≈ 1 , 400 Þ . In a similar calculation for diagnostic tests , the number of genes sequenced in 2001 with a diagnostic test available as of 2009 was 204 , and the probability of having a diagnostic test was . 030 for Celera genes and . 054 for non - Celera genes . If Celera genes had attained the non - Celera average probability of being used in a diagnostic test , there would instead have been 245 diag - nostic tests as of 2009 . Hence , Celera’s IP led to around 40 fewer diagnostic tests as of 2009 ð 245 2 204 ≈ 40 Þ . 16 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions mated coefﬁcients decline in magnitude when I add additional control variables , and the estimates in columns 2 and 3 are on the order of 20 – 30 percent of the sample means . Of course , despite my attempts to control for selection , the lingering concern is that these estimates could be driven by nonrandom selection into Celera’s IP . Sections III . B and III . C present results from my second and third empirical tests , which address selection more directly . B . Panel Estimates My second empirical test investigates whether the removal of Celera’s IP affected within - gene ﬂow measures of subsequent innovation . For gene - year gy , I estimate the following : ð outcome Þ gy 5 a 1 d g 1 g y 1 b ð celera Þ gy 1 ε gy : The celera variable is now an indicator for whether gene g had been sequenced only by Celera as of that year . This celera variable varies within genes over time , and a transition from 1 to 0 represents the removal of Celera’s IP from a given gene . Year ﬁxed effects control for year - speciﬁc shocks that are common across genes , such as annual changes in the level of research funding available from public - sector agencies . Gene ﬁxed effects control for time - invariant differences across genes , such as a gene’s inherent commercial potential . I limit the years in the sample to 2001 – 9 , focusing on the time period in which all Celera genes had been sequenced but vary in their IP status over time . 22 I show estimates from OLS models and report heteroskedasticity - robust stan - dard errors clustered at the gene level . Table 4 presents estimates from the panel speciﬁcation . Columns 1 and 2 are analogous to the cross - section speciﬁcations from table 3 : both control for year ﬁxed effects , column 1 includes indicator variables for the year of disclosure , and column 2 adds count variables for the number of publications in each year from 1970 to 2000 . Column 3 , my preferred speciﬁcation , retains the year ﬁxed effects but replaces the time - invariant covariates with gene ﬁxed effects . Panel A of table 4 reports estimates for the gene - year publications outcome . As in the cross - section speciﬁcation , adding the publication variables does affect the estimated effect of Celera’s IP . In addition , replacing the time - invariant covariates with gene ﬁxed effects further 22 As noted in Sec . II . A , Celera’s sequencing began in 1999 , and its draft genome was disclosed in 2001 . My understanding is that the vast majority of Celera’s data were ﬁrst released in the 2001 draft genome , but I do not observe the timing of sequencing for 1999 – 2001 . In the absence of such data , I limit my panel speciﬁcation to include the years 2001 – 9 since prior to 2001 I do not know whether or not Celera genes had yet been sequenced . intellectual property rights and innovation 17 This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions reduces the magnitude of the estimated effect . That said , the magni - tudes of the coefﬁcients in columns 2 and 3 are broadly similar , which I interpret as suggestive evidence that the cross - section controls are at least somewhat effective in controlling for gene - speciﬁc variation in the publications outcome . In terms of magnitudes , the coefﬁcient in col - umn 3 in panel A of table 4 suggests that Celera’s IP was associated with 0 . 11 fewer publications per year , a decline on the order of 45 percent of the sample mean . Panel B of table 4 reports analogous estimates for the gene - year indi - cator for a gene having any known , uncertain phenotype link as of that year . The coefﬁcient in column 3 suggests that Celera’s IP was associated with an 8 . 3 percentage point reduction in the probability that a gene had a known , uncertain phenotype link , a decline on the order of 22 per - cent of the sample mean .

These estimates suggest that in the ﬁrst year a gene enters the public domain ð t 5 1 on the graph Þ , there is a discrete level shift in the ﬂow of publications related to that gene , which remains relatively con - stant through the end of my data . In theory , the panel estimates in ta - ble 4 could have been driven by short - term shifts in the timing of when research takes place that may or may not have persistent effects on wel - fare . In practice , the results show no clear “bunching” of publications that would be predicted by stories in which researchers strategically wait until IP is removed to publish scientiﬁc papers . Panel B of ﬁgure 4 presents results for the gene - year - level indicator for a gene having any known , uncertain phenotype link . This outcome in - creases in the ﬁrst year a gene enters the public domain ð t 5 1 on the graph Þ and continues to increase through the end of my data . C . Focusing on Celera Genes Figure 5 presents results from my third empirical test . I limit the sample to include only Celera genes and rely solely on variation in how long genes were held with Celera’s IP , that is , whether the Celera gene was re - sequenced by the public effort in 2002 ð N 5 1 , 047 ; public in 2002 Þ or in 2003 ð N 5 635 ; public in 2003 Þ . The evidence presented in Section II . C and ﬁgure 3 suggests that the year in which Celera genes were rese - quenced by the public effort cannot be predicted with gene - level observ - ables . Hence , this analysis should provide a clean test for investigating the effect of being held with Celera’s IP for one additional year . Figure 5 presents means by year for the two panel outcome variables . As expected , the mean levels of both outcome variables are quite similar across the public in 2002 and public in 2003 groups in 2001 , when both sets of genes were held with Celera’s IP . Panel A shows that Celera genes resequenced in 2002 saw a relative uptick in publications in that year , while Celera genes resequenced in 2003 show a similar uptick in 2003 . Flow of scientiﬁc effort into these two cohorts of genes appears to have converged over time : although the difference in means in 2002 is sta - tistically signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level , mean differences in other years are not statistically signiﬁcant . Panel B shows that Celera genes resequenced in 2002 saw a relative increase in the probability of having a known , uncertain genotype - phenotype link in 2002 . However , rather than the public in 2003 group catching up with their public in 2002 counterparts one year later , the public in 2003 group has persistently lower levels of this outcome vari - able through the end of my data . The difference in means is statistically signiﬁcant in 2003 ð at the 10 percent level Þ , 2006 ð at the 10 percent level Þ , 2007 ð at the 5 percent level Þ , and 2008 ð at the 5 percent level Þ . 20 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions F IG . 5 . — Average innovation outcomes for Celera genes by year , by year of resequencing by the public effort : A , Outcome variable : publications ; B , outcome variable : 1 ð known / uncertainphenotype Þ .

This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions The results in ﬁgure 5 suggest that although the ﬂow of scientiﬁc effort into these two cohorts of genes ð as measured by annual pub - lications Þ converged over time , the average stock of scientiﬁc knowledge about genes in these two cohorts ð as measured by having a known , un - certain phenotype Þ did not converge . I test this formally by estimating whether the mean of the public in 2002 cohort in year t is statistically distinguishable from the mean of the public in 2003 cohort in year t 1 1 ; in no year can I reject the null that those means are equal . That is , I cannot reject a model in which an additional year of Celera’s IP induces a permanent loss of 1 year of research . These results provide clear evi - dence that even very temporary forms of IP — here , lasting only 1 year — can have persistent effects on subsequent innovation . IV . What Kinds of Transaction Costs Were Relevant ? Return to the example from the introduction : suppose that Pﬁzer dis - covers a gene - based diagnostic test that requires licensing one of Celera’s genes . Would Celera’s IP impede Pﬁzer’s research ? 23 The empirical evi - dence in this paper suggests that it would , which implies that some form of transaction costs hindered licensing negotiations over Celera’s IP . In evaluating which potential sources of transaction costs were most likely relevant , both Celera’s short - term IP and the expectation that Celera was pursuing patent applications on its genes are relevant . In a perfect contracting environment with no transaction costs , Celera and Pﬁzer would negotiate a licensing agreement such that cumulative research is not hindered . Consider the model of Green and Scotchmer ð 1995 Þ . Licensing agreements can occur at two stages : ex ante , before Pﬁzer invests in the diagnostic test , or ex post , after Pﬁzer has invested in the test . The key distinction is whether Pﬁzer has sunk its research costs at the time of the licensing negotiation . The Green and Scotchmer framework delivers a strong prediction that ex ante licenses are optimal and will always be negotiated . When negotiating ex ante , Pﬁzer has a credible threat not to invest unless Celera is willing to share a positive fraction of the diagnostic test proﬁts . When negotiating ex post , Pﬁzer has diminished bargaining power and faces a potential holdup problem . Despite this strong theoretical prediction , transaction costs may pre - vent ex ante licensing agreements from being successfully negotiated . For example , the Green and Scotchmer ð 1995 Þ framework assumes sym - metric information , but in practice Celera may not have known Pﬁzer’s cost of developing its gene - based diagnostic test . Bessen ð 2004 Þ explores the implications of this type of private information in the Green and 23 Beyond the references in the introduction ð Scotchmer 1991 ; Green and Scotchmer 1995 ; Bessen 2004 Þ , see also the discussions in Merges and Nelson ð 1990 Þ , Heller and Eisenberg ð 1998 Þ , and Shapiro ð 2000 Þ . 22 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Scotchmer framework , showing that private information may cause ne - gotiations to break down , deterring some socially desirable research . Empirically , only a small share of licensing agreements appear to be set ex ante . Anand and Khanna ð 2000 Þ document that in Standard In - dustrial Classiﬁcation 28 ð chemicals and pharmaceuticals Þ , only 23 per - cent of licensing agreements were set ex ante . Consistent with this data , Celera’s data access agreement ð Science Online 2001 Þ , Celera’s DVD user agreement , and my informal discussions with academic and commercial researchers all suggested that Celera’s licensing agreements were fre - quently , if not always , negotiated ex post rather than ex ante . Celera could have avoided transaction costs by conducting in - house research ; indeed , Celera developed and manufactured several gene - based technologies . However , ideas in this market were likely scarce in the sense of Scotchmer ð 1991 Þ : Celera’s scientists did not know how to develop the full set of possible subsequent innovations . Taken together , this suggests that a scarcity of ideas together with asymmetric informa - tion about the costs of development may have generated a ﬁrst source of transaction costs . A second source of potential transaction costs is a version of the clas - sic disclosure problem ð Arrow 1962 Þ , highlighted by Gallini and Wright ð 1990 Þ and Gans and Stern ð 2000 Þ . To negotiate a licensing agreement with Celera , Pﬁzer had to disclose its idea . Because Celera was devel - oping gene - based technologies , Celera had a credible threat to engage in imitative R & D . Either the expectation of Celera’s bargaining position or the actual impact of Celera’s bargaining power in licensing nego - tiations may have generated a second source of transaction costs . A ﬁnal source of potential transaction costs is uncertainty over the academic research exemption . Formally , Celera placed no restrictions on academic research . However , for at least two reasons academic re - searchers may have nonetheless been deterred from using Celera’s data . First , informal discussions with academic scientists suggested that they faced uncertainty over some of Celera’s contractual terms . For example , one scientist I spoke with expressed uncertainty over whether the re - strictions on redistribution implied that she could not share Celera’s data with her graduate students . Because accessing the data required agreeing to Celera’s terms of use , perceived litigation risks may have deterred research even by academics who solely wanted to use the data for noncommercial research . Second , given that the boundary between academic and commercial research is often not clearly delineated — perhaps particularly for biomedical research ð Cohen and Walsh 2008 Þ — the “exemption” for academic research may not have been clear in practice . Celera’s sequencing took place during the biotech boom , when many academics were doing research with an eye toward commercial applications . Celera’s IP may have discouraged that type of academic intellectual property rights and innovation 23 This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions research even in the absence of formal restrictions on academic pub - lications . V . Concluding Remarks Intellectual property is a widely used policy lever for promoting inno - vation , yet relatively little is known about how IP on existing technolo - gies affects subsequent innovation . The sequencing of the human ge - nome provides a useful empirical context , generating variation in IP across a relatively large group of ex ante similar technologies . Across a range of empirical speciﬁcations , I ﬁnd evidence that Celera’s IP led to reductions in subsequent scientiﬁc research and product development on the order of 20 – 30 percent . A caveat to this interpretation of these results is that if innovation inputs are scarce , my estimates could reﬂect the substitution of inno - vative effort away from Celera genes toward non - Celera genes ð as op - posed to a net decrease in total innovation over the set of all genes Þ . 24 Looking at a broad set of academic biomedical researchers , surveys by Walsh , Cho , and Cohen ð 2005 Þ and Walsh , Cohen , and Cho ð 2007 Þ sug - gest that some substitution is relevant : restricted access to tangible re - search inputs ð including information , data , and software Þ appears to shift scientists’ research project choices . If substitution is relevant and re - searchers optimally choose their line of research in the absence of IP , quantifying the welfare costs of IP on cumulative innovation requires estimating the cost of distorting research toward suboptimal projects . If more socially valuable technologies are more likely to be held with IP , these welfare costs could be substantial . While Celera’s gene - level IP did not depend on patent protection , the evidence in this paper is related to the ongoing legal controversy sur - rounding patents on human genes . 25 Echoing the broader debate on patents , proponents argue that gene patents incentivize investment in gene - related technologies , while opponents argue that gene patents sti - ﬂe subsequent product development and restrict patients’ access to gene - 24 A priori , the relevance of substitution depends on whether inputs to gene - related research should be considered relatively ﬁxed or relatively ﬂexible . 25 Two recent court cases are relevant . First , Association for Molecular Pathology v . Myriad Genetics ð formerly Association for Molecular Pathology v . U . S . Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce Þ is a lawsuit challenging the validity of gene patents held by the ﬁrm Myriad Genetics related to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes . In November 2012 , the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the AMP v . Myriad case , with a decision expected before July 2013 . Second , Mayo Collabo - rative Services , dba Mayo Medical Laboratories , et al . v . Prometheus Laboratories Inc . was a lawsuit challenging the patentability of diagnostic tests with implications for the patentability of gene - based diagnostic tests . The US Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in Mayo v . Prometheus in March 2012 , upholding the district court decision that declared Prometheus’s diagnostic test not patent eligible and reversing the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit . 24 journal of political economy This content downloaded from 18 . 7 . 29 . 240 on Thu , 28 Mar 2013 19 : 06 : 13 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions related technologies . 26 To the best of my knowledge , there exists no direct evidence on how gene patents have affected subsequent product devel - opment . Moreover , the overall welfare consequences of gene patents — and patents more generally — depend on the trade - off between ex ante incentives for innovation , the ex post costs of restricting patients’ access to technologies , and any potential effects of IP on subsequent innovation . From a policy perspective , the evidence in this paper informs this gene patent debate by documenting that — at least for some forms of intel - lectual property — getting the incentives “right” for subsequent innova - tors is quantitatively important for encouraging subsequent scientiﬁc research and product development .
