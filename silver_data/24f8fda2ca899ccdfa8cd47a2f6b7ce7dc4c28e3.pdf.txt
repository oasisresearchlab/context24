Assessing Network Representations for Identifying Interdisciplinarity Eoghan Cunningham School of Computer Science , University College Dublin Dublin , Ireland eoghan . cunningham @ ucdconnect . ie Derek Greene School of Computer Science , University College Dublin Dublin , Ireland derek . greene @ ucd . ie ABSTRACT Many studies have sought to identify interdisciplinary research as a function of the diversity of disciplines identified in an article’s refer - ences or citations . However , given the constant evolution of the sci - entific landscape , disciplinary boundaries are shifting and blurring , making it increasingly difficult to describe research within a strict taxonomy . In this work , we explore the potential for graph learning methods to learn embedded representations for research papers that encode their ‘interdisciplinarity’ in a citation network . This fa - cilitates the identification of interdisciplinary research without the use of disciplinary categories . We evaluate these representations and their ability to identify interdisciplinary research , according to their utility in interdisciplinary citation prediction . We find that those representations which preserve structural equivalence in the citation graph are best able to predict distant , interdisciplinary interactions in the network , according to multiple definitions of citation distance .

In light of its perceived importance , many studies have been conducted that quantify article and author interdisciplinarity in an effort to identify relevant research trends and to explore their impact .

Using these methods , a trend towards increased interdisciplinarity has been identified [ 19 ] , which has been been found to correlate positively with research impact [ 8 , 15 ] and productivity [ 9 ] . Despite some agreement across measures of interdisciplinarity ( with many studies based on work by [ 18 ] ) , the literature lacks con - vergence towards a single metric [ 24 ] . Most candidate metrics are reliant on explicit research topic or subject category information , for which sources are numerous , diverse , and sometimes unavail - able . Moreover , the scientific community structure has been shown to be evolving rapidly [ 21 ] . This evolution may explain the lack of agreement between subject taxonomies and hierarchies , which vary considerably [ 13 ] . The limitations of prescribed , static , subject clas - sifications necessitate a modern approach that identifies research disciplines – and indeed interdisciplinarity – according to research network structure . Such an approach may offer a dynamic view of interdisciplinarity , and may help to map emerging developments that do not fit any existing schema [ 24 ] . In this work , we begin to investigate appropriate graph repre - sentation learning methods which allow us to identify and quantify research interdisciplinarity in citation networks , so that we can monitor interdisciplinary interactions and track the development of research topics . We propose to learn unsupervised node ( or paper ) - level representations in research citation networks that encode research ‘interdisciplinarity’ . In pursuit of such a representation , we explore the different network characteristics that embeddings must preserve in order to encode interdisciplinarity and we eval - uate these embeddings according to their utility in an interdisci - plinary citation prediction task . Specifically , we investigate how the performance of link prediction models ( based on different node rep - resentations ) is affected by the distance of citation , according to the hypothesis that representations that encode article interdisciplinar - ity will fare better when predicting “far - reaching” or “long - distance” interdisciplinary interactions / citations [ 8 ] , compared to those that do not . Given the acknowledged limitations of journal - level subject categories , we explore multiple definitions of citation distance : both according to prescribed categories with predefined topic distances , and to network defined distances according to graph structure . 2 BACKGROUND 2 . 1 Measuring Interdisciplinarity Numerous studies have developed metrics for quantifying research interdisciplinarity ( IDR ) . Generally , these methods are designed to evaluate interdisciplinarity in pursuit of three goals : ( i ) to explore trends in IDR over time [ 19 ] , ( ii ) to measure the benefits of IDR [ 8 , 9 , 15 ] , ( iii ) to measure changes in interdisciplinarity in response a r X i v : 2203 . 12455v2 [ c s . D L ] 8 A p r 2022 WWW ’22 Companion , April 25 – 29 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Lyon , France Eoghan Cunningham & Derek Greene to IDR initiatives [ 18 ] . While the proposed approaches are diverse , interdisciplinarity is most commonly measured on the basis of ci - tation analysis . Using citations to model the flow of information , knowledge integration is calculated as a function of the balance , diversity and / or distance between the disciplines identified in ref - erenced articles [ 1 , 15 , 19 , 20 ] . Conversely , knowledge diffusion is measured according to the disciplines of citing articles [ 17 , 23 ] . These definition of knowledge integration , knowledge diffusion , or a combination of both have been used to enumerate interdisci - plinarity for research papers . Invariably , such methods are reliant on explicit topic or discipline categories for research papers , such as those provided by Web of Science , Scopus , or Microsoft Academic . Such explicit categorisations for research papers , especially those assigned at a journal level , are problematic [ 1 , 13 ] . Moreover , the inconsistencies evident across many of these subject taxonomies [ 22 ] may confirm that no singular , correct categorisation exists . However , recent graph learning methods may be capable of learn - ing article representations that encode interdisciplinarity , without any knowledge of explicit discipline categorisation . 2 . 2 Graph Learning - Node Embeddings Motivated by extensive work on embedded representations in nat - ural language processing [ 12 ] , recently there has been considerable focus in the field of network analysis on developing analogous ap - proaches for transforming nodes into low - dimensional vector rep - resentations [ 3 , 5 ] . Methods for producing such representations , or node embeddings , are designed to preserve important relationships between nodes on the graph . In particular , we focus on approaches which preserve proximity ( where similar embeddings are learned for nodes which belong to the same community in the graph ) and structural equivalence ( where similar embeddings are learned for nodes which have the same structural role in the graph ) . The DeepWalk method [ 16 ] , which extends the natural language processing - inspired SkipGram model [ 12 ] , generates fixed - length random walks from all nodes on the graph . The model learns to predict the nodes that will occur on walks given the starting node as input . As such , the model preserves proximities between nodes by learning similar embeddings for nodes which occur in similar contents , i . e . nodes that co - occur on random walks . node2vec , pro - posed by [ 6 ] , extends DeepWalk , introducing two parameters which can be used to bias the random walks in order to explore different aspects of network structure . In our experiments , we implement both DeepWalk and node2vec as examples of proximity preserv - ing node embeddings . We also explore the structural equivalence preserving ‘role embeddings’ learned via role2vec [ 2 ] . The role2vec model further generalises the DeepWalk model attributing struc - tural features ( e . g . graph motif counts ) to nodes before mapping those nodes to ‘roles’ and conducting role - based random walks . 3 DATA We conduct experiments using five citation networks , where each paper is represented as a node and citations are represented as undi - rected edges between them . Three of these datasets are well - known benchmark networks used to evaluate graph learning algorithms . We also contribute two new datasets which we have collected . 3 . 1 Benchmark Datasets As our three benchmark bibliographic datasets we consider Cora [ 11 ] , CiteSeer [ 10 ] , and PubMed [ 14 ] . These datasets range from 2 , 708 to 19 , 717 nodes ( papers ) , with an average node degree ( cita - tions per paper ) ranging from 2 . 7 – 4 . 5 . Each paper is assigned a label , representing a topic or field within a discipline . For example , the Cora dataset contains 7 topics within the field of Computer Science : ‘case based’ , ‘genetic algorithms’ , ’neural networks’ , ‘proba - bilistic methods’ , ‘reinforcement learning’ , ‘rule learning’ , and ‘the - ory’ . While these datasets offer an accessible medium for exploring research networks , the insights gained from them may be limited by their sparsity ( low node degree ) and the scale of interdisciplinarity , i . e . they represent interactions between topics within a discipline , rather than macro interdisciplinary interactions . As such , we also provide two additional citation graphs that are both more complete and more interdisciplinary in nature . 3 . 2 Scopus Indexed Datasets We construct new citation networks using Microsoft Academic Graph citation data from two different sets of journal papers . These sets consist of two samples of articles from Scopus indexed journals , stratified according to their All Science Journal Categories ( ASJC ) . We define two networks containing different topics , so that we can investigate interactions between different subsets of disciplines . We refer to these networks as Scopus1 and Scopus2 . The former con - tains samples of 1 , 500 articles published between 2017 and 2018 in Scopus indexed journals with the ASJCs ‘Computer Science’ , ‘Math - ematics’ , ‘Medicine’ , ‘Chemistry’ , and ‘Social Sciences’ . For Scopus2 , we use the seed set of categories : ‘Computer Science’ , ‘Mathematics’ , ‘Neuroscience’ , ‘Engineering’ , and ‘Biochemistry , Genetics and Molec - ular Biology’ . For both datasets , we maximise the completeness of the graph by including all available referenced articles that are published in Scopus indexed journals . In this manner , we produce dense , multidisciplinary citation networks , such that each article can be categorised according to the ASJC of the journal in which it was published . Scopus1 contains 27 , 213 nodes with average degree 6 . 9 , while Scopus2 contains 25 , 961 nodes with average degree 6 . 2 . See statistics for all datasets in Table 1 of the Appendix . 4 METHODS 4 . 1 Citation Prediction One established method for evaluating the quality of node embed - dings is to assess their performance in a down - stream link predic - tion task [ 6 , 7 ] . We introduce the following citation prediction task to evaluate the quality of our paper representations and their ability to encode the citation graph structure . Further , we explore their ability to identify and predict interdisciplinary interactions in the network through their performance in interdisciplinary citation prediction . We evaluate citation prediction performance with dif - ferent node representations using 75 : 5 : 20 train : validation : test splits of the edges in each network . Three sets of node representations ( DeepWalk , node2vec , and role2vec ) are learned using the subgraph induced by the training edges . In the case of each model , we learn node embeddings with 128 dimensions . To train a Multi - Layer Per - ception ( MLP ) model for the citation prediction task , we supplement Assessing Network Representations for Identifying Interdisciplinarity WWW ’22 Companion , April 25 – 29 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Lyon , France each set of edges with a set of negative edges that were not present in the graph . We then represent each edge as the concatenation of the embedded representations of the associated nodes , and use train and validation edge sets to train an MLP model to classify positive and negative edges . We report performance on the test data as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve ( AUC ) . Each experiment is repeated for 5 random splits of the data and the average AUC score is reported . Using this approach we evaluate the utility of different node representations in both overall citation prediction and in interdisciplinary citation prediction . We use the following methods to identify interdisciplinary ci - tations in the test data according to both binary and continuous definitions of interdisciplinary . We report the binary interdisci - plinary citation prediction score as the AUC performance on the test data for only the edges where the associated nodes belong to different classifications . These scores appear in parentheses in Table 1 . In Figure 1 we compare the relationship between citation prediction performance and citation distance according to our con - tinuous definitions of interdisciplinarity , according to the intuition that representations that encode article interdisciplinarity will fare better when predicting “long - distance” interdisciplinary citations . To explore this relationship , we aggregate the edges in the test data ( into bins of equal width ) according to the chosen definition of citation distance , and plot the AUC for bins that contain at least 25 positive and negative edges . 4 . 2 Citation Distance Metrics To allow us to define a continuous form of interdisciplinarity , we implement and evaluate five definitions of citation distance : Scopus Topic Distance , Network Distance , DeepWalk Embedding Distance , Node2vec Embedding Distance , and Role2vec Embedding Distance . Scopus Topic Distance is defined according the neighbourhood sim - ilarity of the ASJC . Using a network of 6 , 000 , 000 papers published between 2010 and 2020 , we create a discipline - level weighted adja - cency matrix W , that encodes all of the citations between categories in the ASJC . We define the topic distance between two categories 𝑖 and 𝑗 as the value 1 − 𝑆 𝑖𝑗 , where 𝑆 𝑖𝑗 is the cosine - similarity between rows 𝑖 and 𝑗 in W . Thus , we can calculate the Scopus Topic Distance of a citation as the topic distance between the ASJC assigned to each of the relevant papers . We define the Network Distance of a citation as the length of the shortest path on the graph between to the two relevant papers [ 25 ] . Finally , each of the embedding distances is defined as the cosine distance between the two vectors learned for the pair of the papers involved in the citation . 5 RESULTS 5 . 1 Citation Prediction and Binary Interdisciplinarity 5 . 1 . 1 Benchmark Datasets . Table 1 shows citation results for 3 link prediction models , evaluated on 5 citation datasets . In each case , the AUC score is reported for both the entire test set and the inter - disciplinary portion of the test set ( IDR AUC ) . For each dataset , the structural representations learned by role2vec outperform those learned by DeepWalk - based methods . Although predicting inter - disciplinary citations may be slightly more difficult than predicting Table 1 : Citation prediction results : AUC ( IDR AUC ) .

That is , the models which perform best at predicting citations within topics are also the most performant when predict - ing citations between topics . However , due to the limitations in scale and completeness of the benchmark datasets ( see Section 3 . 1 ) , we continue experiments using two new citation graphs collected from journals indexed by Scopus . 5 . 1 . 2 Scopus Indexed Datasets . Table 1 reports citation prediction performance in relation to the Scopus datasets . In the case of these larger , more diverse and denser networks , we find link prediction models are more successful , likely due to the greater completeness of the graph . Moreover , the DeepWalk - based methods are no longer less effective than role2vec embeddings , and the gap between in - tradisciplinary and interdisciplinary scores has reduced further . To understand better the ability of different representations to encode the interdisciplinary role of research articles ( by identifying those which can that can predict citations at greater distances ) , we now move to a continuous definition of citation distance . 5 . 2 Citation Distance Metrics In our Scopus indexed networks , we explore 5 definitions of ci - tation distance : 1 according to journal - level ASJC classifications and their citation neighbourhoods , 3 according to the distance be - tween different unsupervised embedding representations , and 1 according to shortest path distance between papers . We compare these definitions of citation distance below , where we evaluate their relationship with network modularity and edge betweenness . 5 . 2 . 1 Edge Distance and Modularity . We compare frequency dis - tributions for distances of positive and negative edges to examine the extent to which different metrics of edge distance capture mod - ularity in the Scopus networks . See the supplemental figures in the Appendix . Crucially , we find that the DeepWalk and node2vec defined citation distances offer the best separation between distri - butions of positive and negative edges . 5 . 2 . 2 Edge Distance and Edge Betweenness . Table 2 shows Spear - man rank correlations between citation distance and edge between - ness centrality , for each metric of citation distance in the Scopus indexed graph . The edge betweenness centrality for an edge ( or citation ) is a measure of the proportion of shortest paths on the graph which traverse that edge [ 4 ] . So citations which bridge or connect communities will have high edge betweenness centrality . As such , we expect a definition of citation distance which encodes the interdisciplinarity of citation , to correlate positively with edge betweenness . The distance measures defined according to the dis - tance between DeepWalk - based embeddings are shown to have the WWW ’22 Companion , April 25 – 29 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Lyon , France Eoghan Cunningham & Derek Greene Table 2 : Citation distances correlated with edge between - ness . Distance Scopus1 Scopus2 Scopus Topic 0 . 029 - 0 . 020 DeepWalk 0 . 331 0 . 300 Node2vec 0 . 329 0 . 304 Role2vec 0 . 191 0 . 193 strongest correlation with edge betweenness centrality . Conversely , the distances between prescribed topics based on the ASJC from Scopus show no correlation with edge betweenness , indicating that these topic assignments , or at least the defined distances between them , do not reflect the community structure in the graph . We can further investigate the validity of the ASJC paper cate - gorisations in the Scopus datasets , by comparing the edge between - ness scores of inter - and intra - topic edges . If the ASJC assignments represent the communities in the network , we would expect edges that are between ASJC topics ( i . e . citations linking papers of different categories ) to have greater betweenness than those edges that are within ASJC topics ( i . e . linking papers with the same category ) . A Kolmogorov - Smirnov test comparing the edge betweenness distri - butions of inter - and intra - disciplinary edges finds interdisciplinary edges to have greater betweenness at 5 % significance . This indi - cates that , while the predefined distances between ASJC topics do not correlate with citation distance , the ASJC categorisations are somewhat reflective of the communities in the network .

Table 3 reports the linear regression coefficients comparing citation prediction per - formance with citation distance in the Scopus1 network . The ta - ble include stars to highlight regression coefficients significant at 5 % significance . In particular , we note that the models employing role2vec structural representations of the nodes perform better as citation distance increases according to most definitions of citation distance . Table 5 in the Appendix plots similar results for Scopus2 , where role2vec performance again increases with those distances that agree with the underlying network structure . 6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In our investigations of the potential for graph learning methods to identify interdisciplinary research , we explored three different methods of node representation and evaluated their utility in pre - dicting interdisciplinary citations . According to a binary definition of interdisciplinary citation , we found that predicting links between research topics is indeed more difficult than predicting within - topic interactions . This effect is more evident in sparser networks , such as the benchmark citation graphs Cora , CiteSeer , and PubMed . In the more complete citation networks that we have collected ( Sco - pus1 and Scopus2 ) , the distinction between citation prediction and interdisciplinary citation prediction performances are less apparent . We explored a continuous definition of interdisciplinary citation , as some interactions are viewed as being more distant than others [ 8 ] . We evaluated five different definitions of citation distance . Al - though it remains difficult to determine the most accurate means of measuring the distance or interdisciplinarity of citation , we high - lighted a number of issues with the predefined ASJC distances , which do not appear to agree with the underlying network struc - tures . Further , we found that the role2vec - based model achieved citation prediction AUC that correlates positively with all metrics of citation distance that do appear to encode the underlying network structure . This provides evidence that the role2vec - based paper representations are capable of encoding the structural signatures associated with interdisciplinary interactions . We suggest that the embeddings which preserve structural equivalence on the graph are capable of encoding the ‘interdisciplinary role’ of different articles . We plan to extend this work to learning more advanced paper representations by including text features on nodes in the graph . There is also potential to develop means of better explaining these embeddings to quantify interdisciplinarity and interpret the differ - ent interdisciplinary roles of research papers .
