The automated patch - clamp ( APC ) technique overcomes the disadvantages of the manual 22 patch - clamp ( MPC ) technique , which is labor intensive and gives low output . However , the 23 application of the APC platform is still limited in iPSC - CM based research , due to the difficulty 24 in maintaining the high quality of single iPSC - CMs during dissociation and recording . In this 25 study , we improved the method for single iPSC - CM preparation by applying 2 . 5 µM blebbistatin 26 ( BB , an excitation - contraction coupling uncoupler ) throughout APC procedures ( dissociation , 27 filtration , storage , and recording ) . Under non - BB buffered condition , iPSC - CMs in suspension 28 showed a severe bleb - like morphology . However , BB - supplement led to significant 29 improvements in morphology and I Na recording , and we even obtained several CMs that showed 30 spontaneous action potentials with typical morphology . Furthermore , APC faithfully 31 recapitulated the single - cell electrophysiological phenotypes of iPSC - CMs derived from Brugada 32 syndrome patients , as detected with MPC . Our study indicates that APC is capable of replacing 33 MPC in the modeling of cardiac channelopathies using human iPSC - CMs by providing high - 34 quality data with higher throughput . 35 36 Keywords 37 automated patch - clamp , iPSC - derived cardiomyocyte , blebbistatin , calcium paradox , Brugada 38 syndrome , sodium current 39 40 3 Introduction 41 Since the development of patch - clamp techniques for high - resolution current recording from 42 cells and cell - free membrane patches , the manual patch - clamp ( MPC ) technology revolutionized 43 electrophysiological studies [ 1 ] . The high quality of the data obtained with the MPC technique is 44 highly appreciated , but the throughput with this technique is notoriously low [ 2 ] . So far , the 45 modelling of cardiac channelopathies using human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived 46 cardiomyocytes ( iPSC - CMs ) is mostly achieved by studying ion channels using MPC . For 47 example , MPC has been widely used in recordings of I Na ( voltage - gated sodium current ) , I CaL ( L - 48 type voltage - gated calcium current ) , or I kr ( the rapid component of the delayed rectifier 49 potassium current ) in iPSC - CMs to study cardiac channelopathies caused by mutations in genes 50 encoding ion channel proteins , such as SCN5A [ 3 ] , CACNA1C [ 4 ] or KCNH2 [ 5 , 6 ] . For a better 51 overview of the use of MPC in iPSC - CM models of channelopathies , please see the recently 52 published review [ 7 ] . However , the labor - intensive and low - throughput nature of MPC has 53 hindered its large implementation in drug discovery . With these advantages and limitations in 54 mind , the automated patch - clamp ( APC ) technique might play a key role in ion channel research 55 as well as in drug discovery and safety testing [ 8 ] . However , APC poses an often underestimated 56 challenge to the reproducibility of the data with iPSC - CMs , which are obtained using MPC [ 2 ] . 57 The most challenging step for APC is the acquisition of a large number of single iPSC - CMs in 58 suspension at the relaxation stage [ 9 ] . It is assumed that the Ca 2 + - free period is necessary to 59 allow cell separation via the disruption of the Ca 2 + - dependent cadherins [ 10 ] . However , after 60 only a few minutes of Ca 2 + - free perfusion and Ca 2 + repletion , the profound changes to the 61 cardiomyocytes , including ultrastructural alterations , loss of intracellular components , and Na + 62 and Ca 2 + gain , were reported [ 11 ] . This phenomenon was first reported as the calcium paradox 63 4 more than 50 years ago [ 12 ] . Since then , many studies have focused on a better understanding of 64 Ca 2 + - paradox injury [ 11 , 13 - 15 ] . To conquer this paradox , excitation - contraction uncoupling 65 agents like 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) or blebbistatin ( BB ) were commonly used for the 66 isolation of cardiomyocytes from the Langendorff perfused heart or heart tissue using the chunk - 67 method [ 10 ] . Nevertheless , the BDM was reported to have side effects such as reducing I to [ 16 ] , 68 attenuating β - adrenergic response of I CaL [ 17 ] , and even inhibiting mitochondrial respiration [ 18 ] . 69 On the other hand , BB was rarely reported to have electrophysiological side effects in rodents 70 [ 19 , 20 ] , but significant effects in the isolated rabbit heart [ 21 ] . 71 In this study , we improved our previously published cell dissociation method suitable for APC [ 9 ] 72 by supplementing 2 . 5 µM BB in the papain - EDTA - based dissociation solution . Additionally , 2 . 5 73 µM BB was also used for strainer filtration and storage of iPSC - CMs . The extracellular solutions 74 in the liquid handling part of the APC system were also supplemented with 2 . 5 µM BB . We 75 assume that the protection of fragile iPSC - CMs in suspension by applying BB would be 76 beneficial for electrophysiological studies of ion channels by using APC . Our data demonstrate 77 that BB ( 2 . 5 µM ) itself does not exhibit any side effects on action potential ( AP ) and field 78 potential ( FP ) using human iPSC - CMs . Importantly , BB protects human iPSC - CMs in 79 suspension from Ca 2 + - paradox injury and enables recordings of ionic currents and spontaneous 80 APs with APC . Furthermore , we conducted ion channel studies in iPSC - CMs from patients with 81 Brugada syndrome ( BrS ) by using APC . The data on I Na , I to and I CaL were consistent with our 82 previous data obtained by using MPC . Our study indicates that APC is capable of replacing MPC 83 in the modeling of cardiac channelopathies using human iPSC - CMs by providing high quality 84 data with higher throughput . 85 86 5 Material and methods 87 Directed differentiation of iPSCs into iPSC - CMs 88 Directed differentiation of iPSCs into ventricular - like CMs was induced by modulating WNT 89 signaling as previously described [ 22 ] . In this study , we used three different human iPSC lines 90 ( iWT . D2 - 1 / 3 , iBM76 - 1 / 3 and isWT1 . Bld2 ) , which were described previously [ 22 ] . When iPSCs 91 ( cultured on 12 - well plates ) reached around 90 % confluency , differentiation was initiated by 92 changing medium into cardio differentiation medium ( RPMI 1640 with GlutaMax and HEPES 93 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 0 . 5 mg / ml human recombinant albumin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 0 . 2 94 mg / ml L - ascorbic acid 2 - phosphate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ) supplemented with 4 µM of the GSK3 β 95 inhibitor CHIR99021 ( Millipore ) . After 48 hours , the medium was changed to fresh cardio 96 differentiation medium supplemented with 5 µM IWP2 ( WNT signaling inhibitor , Millipore ) for 97 another two days . Afterwards , cells were cultured in the cardio differentiation medium for 98 another 4 days . From day eight on , the cardio differentiation medium was replaced by RPMI / B27 99 medium ( RPMI 1640 with GlutaMax and HEPES , supplemented with 2 % B27 with insulin 100 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ) . On day 20 , beating cardiomyocytes were detached from plates with 101 1 mg / ml collagenase B ( Worthington Biochemical ) , dissociated with 0 . 25 % Trypsin / EDTA 102 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and replated into Geltrex - coated 6 - well plates at a density of 800 , 000 103 cells / well . Afterwards , iPSC - CMs were cultured in RPMI / B27 medium until 3 months . 104 Dissociation of 3 - month - old iPSC - CMs into single cells for automated patch - clamp 105 Our previously published dissociation method was used in this study with some modifications 106 [ 9 ] . Collagenase B ( 1 mg / ml ) was used to pre - treat 3 - month - old iPSC - CMs until the layer of 107 cardiomyocytes detached from the plate . The layer of cardiomyocytes was transferred into a 3 . 5 - 108 6 cm dish and then treated with 2 ml of 20 U / ml papain ( Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in 1 . 1 mM 109 EDTA - buffered RPMI / B27 medium containing 2 . 5 µM BB ( Sigma - Aldrich , dissolved in DMSO 110 as a 10 mM stock ) for 10 min . A fire - polished glass Pasteur pipette was used to gently agitate the 111 cells to release single iPSC - CMs . The cell suspension was filtered through a 30 - µm strainer 112 ( MACS SmartStrainers , Miltenyi Biotec ) to remove cell clusters and was centrifuged for 1 min 113 at 50 g . After gently aspirating the supernatant , the cell pellet was resuspended into 2 ml of 1 . 1 114 mM EDTA - buffered RPMI / B27 medium with 2 . 5 µM BB and then filtered through a 10 - µm 115 strainer ( pluriStrainer ® , pluriSelect ) to collect larger iPSC - CMs . The cells were collected with 2 116 ml of RPMI / B27 medium with 2 . 5 µM BB and then centrifuged for 1 min at 50 g . After 117 removing the supernatant , the cell pellet was gently resuspended and further stored in 2 . 5 µM 118 BB - containing RPMI / B27 medium at 4 °C for 2 h . 119 Contractility and FP measurements 120 For the measurements of contractility and FP together in the same culture , the Maestro Edge 121 multiwell microelectrode array ( MEA ) and impedance system ( Axion BioSystems ) was used . 122 The 3 - month - old iPSC - CMs were dissociated with 0 . 25 % Trypsin - EDTA and seeded at a density 123 of 10 , 000 cells in 8 µl of digestion medium ( RPMI / B27 with 20 % fetal calf serum , and 1 µM 124 Thiazovivin ) into Cytoview MEA 6 - well ( with 64 electrodes ) or 24 - well ( with 16 electrodes ) 125 plates for 1 hour ( Axion BioSystems ) . After cells attached to the plate , 1 ml of digestion medium 126 was added to each well . Every well was pre - coated with 8 µl Geltrex ® ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 127 for at least 1 hour before use . The medium was changed to RPMI / B27 medium one day after 128 plating and thereafter every two days until day 6 . On day 6 , electrical FP and the impedance - 129 based contractility in human iPSC - CMs were measured before and after 2 . 5 µM BB treatment . 130 After calibrating for 10 minutes , the spontaneous recordings were carried out at 37 °C and 5 % 131 7 CO 2 using the AxIS Navigator software ( Axion BioSystems ) . The sample rates were 12 , 500 Hz 132 for FP and 40 Hz for contractility . Spontaneous beating frequency was defined by the reciprocal 133 of averaged inter - beat interval . The spontaneous beating frequency , FP amplitude , and 134 conduction velocity were generated by using the AxIS Navigator software and further analyzed 135 using AxIS Metric Plotting Tool ( Axion BioSystems ) . The mainstream conduction velocity 136 values were averaged for one culture . 137 Manual patch - clamp for AP measurement 138 Human iPSC - CMs around day 90 were enzymatically dissociated into single cells and seeded on 139 5 mm Ø coverslips distributed in 35 - mm dishes . After around 10 days for recovery , the paced 140 APs of a single iPSC - CM were measured at room temperature with a ruptured whole - cell current 141 clamp using HEKA EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster ( HEKA Elektronik ) . The pipette and 142 extracellular solutions for paced AP recordings were listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The 143 pacing stimulus was 0 . 5 Hz . Pipette potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials . More 144 than 5 continuously stable , paced APs were chosen and analyzed using LabChart ® 145 ( ADInstruments ) to determine AP duration at 90 % repolarization ( APD90 ) , AP amplitude ( APA ) , 146 and resting membrane potential ( RMP ) . 147 Calcium transient measurement 148 Paced whole - cell calcium transients were measured according to our previous publication [ 23 ] . 149 CMs around day 80 were dissociated and replated on coverslips at a density of 200 , 000 cells / well 150 ( 6 - well plate ) . Cells recovered for at least 10 days were loaded with Fura - 2 ( Thermo Fisher 151 Scientific ) at a final concentration of 5 µM in RPMI / B27 medium for 30 min at 37 °C and 152 washed twice with the medium . Before measurement , cells were incubated for 10 min to enable 153 8 complete de - esterification of intracellular Fura - 2 . Calcium transients were recorded using a 40× 154 objective on an Olympus IX70 microscope fitted with an IonWizard software ( IonOptix ) at 155 35 °C . Samples were excited at 340 and 380 nm with a switching frequency of 200 Hz and the 156 emitted fluorescence was collected at 510 nm . The cytosolic Ca 2 + level was measured as the ratio 157 of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm ( 340 / 380 nm ) in Tyrode’s solution . To minimize the 158 phototoxicity and photoinactivation effects of BB , the recording was paused during the BB 159 exposure time . To normalize the Ca 2 + transient frequency , iPSC - CMs were field - stimulated 160 using a MyoPacer ( IonOptix ) at a pacing frequency of 0 . 25 Hz ( 6 V , 10 ms ) . The monotonic 161 transient analysis was performed using LabChart ® ( ADInstruments ) and the following 162 parameters were determined : peak amplitude of Ca 2 + transients ( the Fura - 2 ratio at systole 163 subtracted by the Fura - 2 ratio at diastole ) , decay rate ( tau ) , as well as duration of Ca 2 + transients . 164 Automated patch - clamp 165 All experiments were performed at room temperature using an APC system ( Patchliner Quattro , 166 Nanion Technologies GmbH ) with low resistance NPC - 16 chips . The pipette and extracellular 167 solutions for I Na , I to , and I CaL recordings were listed in Supplementary Table 1 . From a holding 168 potential of - 100 mV , I Na was recorded using voltage steps from - 80 to + 70 mV for 20 ms in a 5 169 mV step at an interval of 2000 ms ( shown as an inset in Figure 3B and 4B ) . Nifedipine ( 10 µM ) 170 was used to block I CaL . I to was recorded by increasing the testing potential stepwise from - 40 mV 171 to + 60 mV in a 10 mV step from a holding potential of - 90 mV with a 20 ms pre - pulse to - 35 172 mV to inactivate I Na ( shown as an inset in Figure 4D ) . CdCl 2 ( 0 . 5 mM ) was used to block 173 calcium current . Each pulse lasted for 400 ms , the sweep interval was 10 s . To record I CaL , cells 174 were depolarized for 100 ms to voltages between - 80 to + 50 mV from a holding potential of - 90 175 mV , the sweep interval was 3 s ( shown as an inset in Figure 4F ) . Currents were sampled at 25 176 9 kHz and low - pass - filtered at 2 . 9 kHz . The cells with series resistance < 5 M Ω were used for 177 further analysis . The liquid junction potentials were not compensated during recordings but 178 adjusted after the measurement for each cell separately . The liquid junction potentials were 179 assessed under current - clamp mode with the MPC system . 180 The dynamic patch - clamp experiment for AP recordings was carried out using the Dynamite 181 system from Nanion GmbH [ 24 ] . I K1 conductance was set to 2000 pS / pF . The pacing pulse was 182 800 pA with a duration of 2 ms and at a rate of 0 . 5 Hz ( shown as an inset in Figure 3E ) . 183 The data were exported by using Patchmaster and further analyzed with Graph Pad Prism 5 184 ( GraphPad Software , Inc ) . 185 Statistics 186 Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5 using the paired Student’s t - test to 187 compare differences between two paired groups , and the two - way ANOVA with Bonferroni 188 post - test for comparison of more groups and conditions . Data are presented as the mean ± 189 standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . For a better visualization of the spread of the data , boxplots 190 were used in some experiments . Results were considered statistically significant when the p - 191 value was < 0 . 05 . 192 193 Results and discussion 194 Blebbistatin prevents freshly isolated iPSC - CMs from hypercontraction 195 In the previous study , we reported a Ca 2 + - free method for iPSC - CM dissociation into a single 196 CM suspension [ 9 ] . We can obtain a large quantity of flake - and rod - like CMs and store the cells 197 10 at the relaxation stage for at least 2 hours , which is required for patch - clamp experiments ( Figure 198 1A ) . However , we observed the calcium paradox when we switch the solution from 1 . 1 mM 199 EDTA - buffered RPMI / B27 medium to the physiological external solution ( containing 2 mM 200 CaCl 2 ) , which is used for APC . Almost all CMs immediately developed severe membrane blebs , 201 no matter whether they were stored for 2 hours or only 5 minutes ( Figure 1B ) . 202 The Ca 2 + - free period ( 1 . 1 mM EDTA - buffered RPMI / B27 medium ) is necessary for CM 203 separation by the disruption of the Ca 2 + - dependent cell - cell adhesion mediated by cadherins . 204 However , previous study showed that switching from a Ca 2 + - free to a Ca 2 + - repletion condition 205 used for CMs led to ultrastructural alterations , loss of intracellular components , and Na + and 206 Ca 2 + gain [ 11 ] . To solve this calcium paradox issue , we tested the excitation - contraction 207 uncoupler blebbistatin ( BB , 2 . 5 µM , myosin II inhibitor [ 25 ] ) in the whole APC procedure 208 including the dissociation , filtration , storage , and recording steps ( Figure 1C ) . Since BB is light 209 sensitive [ 26 ] , we avoid its light exposure during the whole procedure . We found the iPSC - CMs 210 in suspension were maintained at the relaxation state even 2 hours after dissociation when the 211 BB - buffered RPMI / B27 medium containing 0 . 4 mM Ca 2 + was used as the storage solution 212 ( Figure 1D ) . To meet the needs of the APC process , where 2 mM Ca 2 + - containing physiological 213 external solution was used for CM capturing , we switched from BB - buffered RPMI / B27 medium 214 to BB - buffered external solution containing 2 mM CaCl 2 . We found that the majority of CMs 215 remained the flake - and rod - like relaxation shapes for all 4 time points ( 5 min , 30 min , 1 h , and 2 216 hours ) after approximately 1 - minute of solution exchange ( Figure 1E ) . To further test whether 217 the flake - and rod - like shapes could persist throughout the patch progress , generally about 10 218 minutes , we recorded the CM morphologies and confirmed that the flake - and rod - like shapes 219 were maintained for at least 10 minutes in BB - buffered physiological external solution ( Figure 220 11 1F ) . Our data demonstrate that BB can be used for preparation of single cell suspension and 221 storage of human iPSC - CMs . This is consistent with previous studies showing that BB can be 222 used for the isolation and culture of high quality and viable adult mouse CMs [ 18 , 27 ] . 223 224 Blebbistatin shows no effects on electrical signals of iPSC - CMs 225 Since the electrophysiological effects of BB have been controversially reported in different 226 species , we assessed BB effects on contractility , FP , and AP in human iPSC - CMs . By utilizing 227 the Maestro Edge multiwell MEA and impedance system , we could record the FP and 228 impedance - based contractility in the same culture of iPSC - CMs before and after BB treatment 229 for 10 min ( Figure 2A - C ) . We tested 3 different concentrations of BB ( 1 , 2 . 5 and 10 µM ) and 230 found that the contractility was abolished in most iPSC - CM cultures after the application of 2 . 5 231 µM BB for 3 - 5 minutes ( Figure 2A , B ) , which is mainly due to the binding of BB to myosin II . 232 However , the FP metrics such as spontaneous excitation frequency ( Hz ) , spike amplitude ( mV ) , 233 and conduction velocity ( cm / s ) did not alter ( Figure 2B and C ) . Similar results were obtained 234 with 10 µM BB treatment , abolishing contraction within 1 minute ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . 235 Treatment with 1 µM BB failed to completely block the contractility of iPSC - CMs within 10 236 minutes ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . Moreover , with the prolonged incubation of human iPSC - 237 CMs with 2 . 5 µM BB up to 1 hour , we did not observe differences in FP parameters 238 ( Supplementary Figure 1C - E ) . These data indicate that the BB treatment ( 2 . 5 µM ) has no effects 239 on electrical field potential of human iPSC - CMs but prevents their beating . Our study is 240 consistent with previous studies , in which the treatments with 1 µM [ 28 ] and 10 µM [ 29 ] BB did 241 not show any effects on FP of human iPSC - CMs . Based on these findings , we applied 2 . 5 µM 242 BB during the whole APC procedure for the following experiments . 243 12 We then investigated the effects of 2 . 5 µM BB treatment on AP morphologies of iPSC - CMs by 244 using MPC when the cells were paced at 0 . 5 Hz . We did not observe any differences in APD90 , 245 APA , and RMP before and after the treatment with 2 . 5 µM BB for 10 min ( Figure 2D and E ) . 246 Similar results showing no effect of treatment with 10 µM BB for 5 min on APD were reported 247 in isolated mouse CMs [ 19 ] . Furthermore , superfusion of an explanted zebrafish embryonic heart 248 with BB ( 1 , 5 and 10 µM ) was reported to have no effects on AP morphology and AP parameters 249 including APD , RMP and maximum upstroke velocity in both atrial and ventricular CMs [ 30 ] . 250 Superfusion with 10 µM BB for 60 min also did not induce any changes in AP morphologies 251 paced at 2 . 5 Hz as registered by microelectrodes from preparations of rabbit atria and ventricles 252 [ 20 ] . However , another study showed that the 60 - min perfusion with BB ( 5 μ M ) significantly 253 prolonged optically recorded APs and corrected QT interval on ECG of the rabbit heart [ 21 ] . 254 255 Blebbistatin does not alter the magnitude of intracellular calcium transient 256 To study whether 2 . 5 µM BB application affects intracellular calcium transient , human iPSC - 257 CMs were labelled with the ratio - metric fluorescent calcium indicator Fura - 2 ( Figure 2F , G ) . Our 258 data showed that BB has no effect on Ca 2 + transient morphology as well as parameters such as 259 amplitude , systolic Ca 2 + level ( Figure 2F , G ) , or decay rate ( before : 1 . 03 ± 0 . 015 ; after : 1 . 04 ± 260 0 . 014 ; p = 0 . 576 ) . After 5 min , 2 . 5 µM BB application led to the reduction of diastolic Ca 2 + level 261 from 0 . 76 ± 0 . 009 to 0 . 71 ± 0 . 009 ( n = 18 from 4 differentiations , paired , p < 0 . 001 ) in iPSC - 262 CMs paced at 0 . 25 Hz . Similar results were observed in rat cardiomyocytes loaded with the 263 ratio - metric fluorescent calcium indicator Indo - 1 [ 31 ] . Whereas Ca 2 + transient amplitude , and the 264 decay were not affected by 1 h application of 0 . 5 μ M BB , diastolic Ca 2 + level revealed a slight 265 reduction after BB application [ 31 ] . Notably , BB application resulted in significant elevations of 266 13 diastolic fluorescence level in rat cardiomyocytes labelled with the non - ratiometric fluorescent 267 calcium indicators Fluo - 4 [ 31 ] or Fluo - 5F [ 20 ] whereas BB did not affect the intracellular Ca 2 + 268 transient amplitude as assessed by either Fluo - 4 or Fluo - 5F . Since both Fluo - 4 and Fluo - 5F are 269 not ratio - metric , therefore , the increase in diastolic fluorescence must be interpreted with caution . 270 Given differences observed by applications of different ratio - metric or non - ratiometric 271 fluorescent indicators , we can speculate that light - sensitive BB tangles with different dyes . 272 273 Blebbistatin protects the function of the sodium channel from calcium paradox 274 To evaluate whether the relaxation morphologies and state of iPSC - CMs achieved by BB 275 supplement during the whole experimental process ( dissociation , straining , storage , and APC 276 recording ) make significant differences for current recording , we first recorded I Na by using 277 physiological external solution containing 140 mM [ Na + ] o ( Figure 3A ) . In the control group 278 without BB , the peak I Na ( - 183 . 4 ± 22 . 5 pA / pF ) appeared at - 15 mV while in the group with BB , 279 the peak I Na of - 307 . 2 ± 35 . 1 pA / pF ( n = 51 ) was found at - 25 mV ( Figure 3B ) . Similarly , the 280 steady - state activation curve was significantly shifted in a direction with more negative 281 membrane potentials in iPSC - CMs with BB buffering compared with iPSC - CMs without BB 282 buffering ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . V 1 / 2 was - 36 . 5 ± 1 . 2 mV for iPSC - CMs with BB 283 buffering ( n = 47 ) , - 31 . 9 ± 1 . 8 mV for iPSC - CMs without BB buffering ( n = 28 , P < 0 . 05 ) . 284 Steady - state inactivation of sodium channels did not differ between the two groups 285 ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) . Unlike the control group without BB , in the group with 2 . 5 µM BB 286 supplement , the majority of I Na activation stages lost voltage control ( Figure 3A ) , a sign of too 287 high extracellular Na + concentration for patch - clamp . We even have four ‘out - of - gain’ 288 recordings using the APC gain setting ( 0 . 5 mV / pA for a maximum of 20 nA ) , as we previously 289 14 observed with MPC using external solution containing 140 mM [ Na + ] o , indicating that I Na 290 recorded in iPSC - CMs with BB treatment were too large at 140 mM [ Na + ] o for the amplifier and 291 voltage clamp was lost . Taken together , these findings suggest that BB supplement protects the 292 sodium channel from Ca 2 + - paradox injury leading to the increase in sodium current density . 293 Therefore , in the following study , we reduced the extracellular Na + concentration and found that 294 none of iPSC - CMs with BB treatment showed ‘out - of - gain’ I Na under 50 mM [ Na + ] o ( Figure 4A - 295 B ) . 296 297 The use of blebbistatin enables the recording of spontaneous I K1 - compensated APs with APC 298 A big problem for electrophysiological studies using human iPSC - CMs with APC is that it is 299 almost impossible to record spontaneous APs , even after an injection of virtual , simulated I k1 into 300 the cells [ 9 ] , because of fresh enzymatic digestion and Ca 2 + - paradox injury . Under BB - buffered 301 condition , we were surprised to obtain some CMs exhibiting spontaneous APs with typical 302 morphology after an injection of virtual , simulated I k1 into the cells ( Figure 3C and D ) . 303 Compared to our previously published APD 50 and APD 90 data of dynamic I K1 - supplemented , 304 paced APs in iPSC - CMs without BB buffering [ 9 ] , APD 50 and APD 90 were significantly longer 305 ( APD 50 : 200 . 4 ± 26 . 4 ms vs . 108 . 8 ± 22 . 7 ms , p = 0 . 017 , t - test ; APD 90 : 324 . 8 ± 29 . 3 ms vs . 306 193 . 7 ± 28 . 9 ms , p = 0 . 005 , t - test ) in iPSC - CMs under BB - buffered condition ( Figure 3E and F ) . 307 In cardiomyocytes , Ca 2 + influx via L - type calcium channels plays a multi - functional role in 308 controlling APD and regulating muscle contraction [ 32 ] . Considering that BB itself does not 309 affect APD of iPSC - CMs ( Figure 2D and E ) , it is possible that BB protects the function of not 310 only the sodium channel but also other ion channels ( e . g . L - type calcium channel and potassium 311 channels ) from Ca 2 + - paradox injury in single iPSC - CMs during the APC process . Previous 312 15 studies demonstrated that calcium paradox injury was also mediated through transient receptor 313 potential canonical ( TRPC ) channels in mouse ventricular myocytes [ 13 ] and sevoflurane can 314 protect cardiomyocytes from calcium paradox - mediated calcium overload by blocking the 315 activation of TRPC channels [ 33 ] . It would be interesting to use TRPC blockers ( like sevoflurane ) 316 to intervene the calcium paradox in future studies . Taken together , these findings indicate that 317 hypercontracted iPSC - CMs are not suitable for electrophysiological research using APC because 318 the calcium paradox can have catastrophic consequences without any intervention [ 11 , 14 , 15 ] . 319 Therefore , electrophysiological studies using human iPSC - CMs with APC require the use of 320 excitation - contraction coupling uncoupler during single cell preparation and for current and AP 321 recordings . 322 323 Blebbistatin facilitates disease modelling for Brugada syndrome using iPSC - CMs with APC 324 To study whether human iPSC - CMs under BB - buffered condition can be used with APC for 325 disease modelling , we repeated I Na recording under 50 mM [ Na + ] o using APC in previously 326 published BrS disease models [ 34 ] . In the presence of 2 . 5 µM BB , single iPSC - CMs were 327 obtained from two healthy donors ( Ctrl1 = iBP76 . 3 and Ctrl2 = iWT . D2 . 1 ) and two BrS patients 328 ( BrS1 and BrS2 harboring the same SCN5A p . S1812X mutation . The APC system Patchliner 329 Quattro used in this study allows the recordings from 4 cells simultaneously . To reduce the 330 variabilities among different cell lines and experiments , we performed at least 3 differentiation 331 experiments for each donor / patient and carried out recordings from 4 or 8 cells per experiment . 332 As shown in Figure 4A , the I Na density in BrS - CMs was dramatically lower compared to that in 333 Ctrl - CMs . Under the testing potentials ranging from - 40 mV to 15 mV , I Na densities in both 334 BrS1 - and BrS2 - CMs were significantly smaller than in Ctrl1 - and Ctrl2 - CMs ( Figure 4B ) . The 335 16 peak I Na appeared at - 20 mV in Ctrl1 - and Ctrl2 - CMs showed as - 114 . 9 ± 11 . 7 and - 117 . 5 ± 20 . 7 336 pA / pF , and in BrS1 - and BrS2 - CMs presented as - 63 . 5 ± 7 . 3 and - 45 . 9 ± 6 . 0 pA / pF , respectively . 337 These results generated by using APC were consistent with our previous results acquired with 338 MPC , which also revealed a more than 50 % reduction of I Na density in BrS - CMs [ 34 ] . 339 The peak I to at + 60 mV in BrS1 - CMs ( 9 . 7 ± 2 pA / pF ) and BrS2 - CMs ( 10 . 8 ± 2 . 2 pA / pF ) were 340 significantly bigger than those in Ctrl1 - CMs ( 4 . 7 ± 0 . 5 pA / pF ) and Ctrl2 - CMs ( 5 . 7 ± 0 . 8 pA / pF ) 341 ( Figure 4C and D ) . The I to recorded with APC are in line with our previous publication of MPC 342 results : the I to at + 60 mV in BrS1 - CMs and BrS2 - CMs were 2 . 4 and 1 . 9 times bigger than those 343 in Ctrl - CMs [ 34 ] . Furthermore , consistent with our MPC data , we did not observe any I CaL 344 density differences between Ctrl - CMs and BrS - CMs ( Figure 4 E , F ) . 345 In summary , we first report the optimization of single iPSC - CM preparation for APC recording 346 in this study . With the supplement of BB to the whole procedures ( dissociation , filtration , storage , 347 and recording ) , we could make significant improvement , not only in obtaining relaxed iPSC - 348 CMs , but also in I Na and AP recordings . Furthermore , APC faithfully recapitulates the single - cell 349 electrophysiological phenotypes of iPSC - CMs derived from BrS patients , as detected with MPC . 350 Our study suggests that APC is capable of replacing MPC in the modeling of cardiac 351 channelopathies using human iPSC - CMs by providing high - quality data with higher throughput . 352 Although the high cost of APC consumables ( e . g . chips , plates , high number of iPSC - CMs 353 needed ) still limits its wide application in channelopathy research and drug screening , the 354 development of APC technology is continuing to meet the needs across drug discovery in 355 pharmaceutical , biotech and academic research laboratories . For example , the new SyncroPatch 356 384 APC system enables parallel data acquisition of 384 cells and is suitable for high - throughput 357 research . 358 17 359 Author Contributions 360 WL and KG conceived the study and designed experiments .
