In a prospective single center cohort study , we enrolled 196 frontline HCWs exposed to the SARS - Cov - 2 and 60 patients with moderate and severe forms of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . Serological tests and cytokines assay were performed to analyze SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc humoral and cellular immunity . Of the 196 HCWs tested , 15 % had speciﬁc antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 and 45 % of seropositive HCWs were strictly asymptomatic . However , in comparison to moderate and severe forms , HCWs with mild or asymptomatic forms of COVID - 19 showed lower speciﬁc IgA and IgG peaks , consistent with their mild symptoms , and a robust immune cellular response , illustrated by a high production of type I and II interferons . Further studies are needed to evaluate whether this interferon functional immune assay , routinely applicable , can be useful in predicting the risk of severe forms of COVID - 19 . Keywords : health care workers , SARS - CoV - 2 , COVID - 19 , humoral response , cellular response , blood immune biomarkers INTRODUCTION Following the ﬁrst descriptions of acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan , Hubei province , China , at the end of December 2019 , a novel beta coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was identiﬁed ( 1 ) . This virus , responsible for the new coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) , quickly spread to other regions of China and then outside the country . The pandemic stage was declared by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on March 11 , 2020 . Cremoni et al . HCWs and Immunity Against COVID - 19 The transmission of COVID - 19 to health care workers ( HCWs ) is a serious concern as it puts potentially very vulnerable patient populations at risk . Nasopharyngeal swabs ( NPSs ) are being widely used as specimens for real - time reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR to detect symptomatic HCWs ( fever , cough , fatigue , muscle pain , diarrhea ) . This common practice helps to slow or stop the spread of infection and protect patients and other HCWs . However , a signiﬁcant proportion of those infected were asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic but still transmitted the virus ( 2 – 4 ) . As shown in previous studies , patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 develop an antibody response against the virus ( 5 ) . Asymptomatic individuals , however , appear to reveal a weaker humoral immune response ( 6 ) . Other studies , conducted in patients with moderate to severe forms of COVID - 19 , looked at the cellular immune response . They showed that lymphopenia ( 1 , 7 ) , and type I and II interferon ( IFN ) deﬁciency secreted by the remaining T cells ( 8 – 10 ) correlate with the severity of the disease . At present , this cellular immune response has not yet been studied in asymptomatic subjects . To our knowledge , only few studies have been conducted characterizing both humoral and cellular immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( 11 ) , and no study investigated this global immune response in a speciﬁc population of frontline HCWs particularly exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 during the pandemic . In this prospective single - centered cohort study , we ﬁrst sought to assess the SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies seroprevalence of asymptomatic and pauci - symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in frontline health care workers , as well as compare their humoral and cellular response to patients with moderate and severe forms of COVID - 19 . In addition to improving knowledge on the immune response to this emerging disease , the identiﬁcation of potential blood immune biomarkers predictive of the response to SARS - CoV - 2 could allow us to better prevent the onset of severe forms of COVID - 19 , particularly in subjects highly exposed to the virus such as frontline HCWs . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Participants We performed a prospective cohort study of subjects exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 virus at Nice University Hospital , France . For this , we included volunteer frontline health care workers ( HCWs ) deﬁned as those working in units providing care for patients with conﬁrmed COVID - 19 , in Nice University Hospital from April 15 to May 26 , 2020 . After signing an informed consent , they completed a self - questionnaire and had their blood drawn to perform a serological test and a functional immune assay . Exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) pregnancy or breastfeeding ; ( 2 ) HCWs having received previous immunosuppressive therapy for COVID - 19 treatment . We divided seropositive SARS - CoV - 2 HCWs into four subgroups according to the symptoms that occurred in the 3 months preceding the blood test and that they had to declare in the questionnaire : ( 1 ) strictly asymptomatic ; ( 2 ) mild symptoms if they had common symptoms of COVID - 19 , including fever , fatigue , cough , rhinorrhea , muscle pain , headache , diarrhea , anosmia or other ﬂu - like symptoms ( 1 , 7 ) ; ( 3 ) moderate form of COVID - 19 if they were hospitalized in infectious diseases units due to clinical symptoms associated with dyspnea and radiologic ﬁndings consistent with a COVID - 19 pneumonia on thoracic CT - scan ; ( 4 ) severe form of COVID - 19 if they were either hospitalized or transferred to the intensive care unit with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation , or with multiple organ failure . Household members of the HCWs tested seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection were also invited to participate in the study . We performed a second prospective cohort study made up of patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 followed at Nice University Hospital , France . The inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) all adult patients hospitalized for COVID - 19 in infectious diseases units ( IDU ) or in intensive care unit ( ICU ) , in Nice University Hospital from March 13 to April 16 , 2020 ; ( 2 ) ability to sign an informed consent . Exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) age under 18 ; ( 2 ) patients under custody , in prison or with a mental illness ; ( 3 ) pregnancy or breastfeeding ; ( 4 ) patients having received previous immunosuppressive therapy for COVID - 19 treatment . The patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of infection with SARS - CoV - 2 : moderate or severe forms of COVID - 19 as above . All patients presented a COVID - 19 symptomatology according to WHO recommendations ( 12 ) with a CT - scan characteristic of COVID - 19 ( 13 ) or two consecutive positive RT - PCR tests for SARS - CoV - 2 on upper and lower respiratory tract specimens ( NPS or invasive respiratory sample ) . Procedures Data Collection Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using the electronic medical records applications Clinicom R (cid:13) and ORBIS R (cid:13) for COVID - 19 patients and the self - questionnaire for HCWs . This self - administered questionnaire collected information on demographic factors , medical history , previous or present treatments , hospital function , known risk factors for COVID - 19 , and symptoms that may have occurred in the 3 months preceding the blood sample . HCWs were also asked if they had already been tested for COVID - 19 RT - PCR and what were the results . When available , the time delays ( in days ) between the onset of the ﬁrst symptoms of COVID - 19 and inclusion , i . e . , the day of the ﬁrst blood sampling , were recording . For asymptomatic IgA - positive HCWs without anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies , we estimated this time to be between 7 and 10 days . We considered this data to be missing for asymptomatic HCWs who were IgG - positive with or without IgA antibodies . Sampling Process SARS - CoV - 2 virological tests for patients followed the World Health Organization recommendations ( 12 ) . NPSs were obtained by nurses or physicians using a standard technique and were immediately placed in a transport medium and delivered to our central laboratory to conﬁrm COVID - 19 by real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) methods . Blood samples were collected at day 0 of the admission and at several follow - up points up to 2 months after hospital admission for COVID - 19 patients , and at inclusion for HCWs . For hospital staﬀ tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , a Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 2 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al . HCWs and Immunity Against COVID - 19 second blood sample was taken 1 month after inclusion . Samples were immediately processed and then frozen and stored at − 20 ◦ C until serological tests and functional immune assay ( cellular response / cytokines assay ) were performed . Freeze - thaw cycles were minimized to preserve the quality of the samples . Laboratory Methods Serological Test Serological tests for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgA and IgG isotypes antibodies were performed on serum using a commercially available enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) which used the S1 - domain of the spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 as the antigen ( Euroimmun AG , Lübeck , Germany , # EI 2606 - 9601 A and # EI 2606 - 9601 G ) . They were run on IF Sprinter IFT / ELISA ( Euroimmun ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The results are evaluated by calculating the ratio between the optical density ( OD ) of the sample at 450 nm and the OD of the calibrator at 450 nm , according to the following formula : OD of the sample OD of the calibrator = OD ratio According to the manufacturer’s recommendations , the results were then interpreted as follows : OD ratio < 0 . 8 = negative ; ≥ 0 . 8 and < 1 . 1 = indeterminate ; ≥ 1 . 1 = positive ( 14 ) . Cellular Response / Cytokines Assay One milliliter of whole blood was stimulated with immune ligands [ anti - CD3 as T - cells stimulant , and R848 as Toll - like receptors 7 / 8 ( TLR 7 / 8 ) agonist ] on single lyophilized spheres ( LyoSphere TM , Qiagen ) within 8 h from blood collection . Stimulated blood samples were incubated for 16 – 24 h at 37 ◦ C and then centrifuged at 2 , 000 – 3 , 000 × g for 15 min to harvest the stimulated supernatant . Levels of cytokines after non - speciﬁc stimulation were measured using IFN - γ ELISA microplates from QuantiFERON - Monitor test ( Qiagen R (cid:13) ) and Ella ( ProteinSimple R (cid:13) ) custom - designed cartridges for the detection of IFN - α , following the manufacturers’ instructions . Statistical Analyses For descriptive statistics , data are presented as mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables with Gaussian distribution , as median and range for quantitative variables with non - Gaussian distribution , or as numbers and percentages for qualitative variables . The Shapiro - Wilk test was used to determine if a variable had a Gaussian distribution or not . Quantitative variables were compared by the unpaired t - test or one - way ANOVA if the values were normally distributed and by the Mann - Whitney test if they were not . Qualitative variables were compared using Chi - square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate . A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was used to compare two measurements of a quantitative variable . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , San Diego , CA ) . Diﬀerences were considered signiﬁcant when P value < 0 . 05 . Ethics and Consent The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was reviewed and approved by our local institutional review committee ( NCT04355351 ) . Written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to inclusion in the study . All collected data and samples were securely stored . RESULTS Participants’ Characteristics Between April 15 and May 26 , 2020 , we enrolled 196 frontline HCWs in Nice University Hospital . Twenty - nine ( 15 % ) were seropositive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Nine HCWs had a positive NPS : one with moderate symptoms of COVID - 19 requiring hospitalization in infectious diseases unit ( IDU ) , seven with mild symptoms and one asymptomatic subject but with close contact with a conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case . Twenty HCWs had no NPS but were found seropositive : eight had presented mild symptoms compatible with a COVID - 19 , and 12 were asymptomatic ( Figure 1 ) . Overall , 1 / 29 ( 3 % ) seropositive HCWs had moderate symptoms , 15 / 29 ( 52 % ) had mild symptoms of COVID - 19 , and 13 / 29 ( 45 % ) were strictly asymptomatic ( Figure 2B ) . Of these 29 infected HCWs , 12 presented only IgA antibodies and 17 had IgA and IgG seroconversion ( Figure 2A ) . Among them , the nine infected HCWs who had a positive PCR had both IgA and IgG . The presence of IgA antibodies would indicate contamination more than 10 days ago with a sensitivity of 100 % ( 14 ) , while IgG detection would signify contamination more than 21 days ago with a sensitivity of 100 % ( 14 ) . Twenty - one ( 72 % ) infected HCWs were women with a median ( IQR ) age of 38 ( 31 – 43 ) years , while 23 ( 38 % ) infected patients were women with a median age of 65 ( 54 – 74 ) years , reﬂecting the high proportion of young women in health care . Most HCWs were nursing assistants [ six seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 out of 32 tested ( 15 % ) ] , physicians [ 7 / 41 ( 17 % ) ] , nurses [ 8 / 53 ( 15 % ) ] and medicine residents [ 4 / 32 ( 12 . 5 % ) ] ( Table 1 ) . The other HCWs in the cohort were dietitians , nursing students , physiotherapists , and psychologists ( none seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 out of seven tested ) . HCWs working in COVID units but not directly in contact with patients were hospital engineers [ two seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 out of three tested ( 67 % ) ] , laboratory technicians [ 1 / 3 ( 33 % ) ] , hospital service agents [ 1 / 11 ( 9 % ) ] , senior health managers ( 0 / 9 ) , medical secretaries ( 0 / 4 ) and clinical research assistants ( 0 / 1 ) . We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the rate of SARS - CoV - 2 infection between HCWs directly exposed and those not directly exposed to infected patients ( p = 0 . 38 ) ( Table 1 , Figure 3 ) . Between March 13 and April 16 , 2020 , we enrolled 60 patients with COVID - 19 in Nice University Hospital , divided in two subgroups : moderate ( n = 30 ) and severe cases of COVID - 19 ( n = 30 ) . This cohort was compared to the frontline HCWs . Demographic and baseline characteristics of the 29 HCWs and 60 patients with COVID - 19 , separated into three groups according to the severity of symptoms , are summarized in Tables 2 , 3 . The cohort of infected HCWs included signiﬁcantly Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 3 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al .

( B ) RT - PCR results and symptomatology of HCWs seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 . fewer men ( 8 / 29 , 28 % ) than that of patients ( 37 / 60 , 62 % ) . The HCWs were also younger [ 38 ( 31 – 43 ) years ] than the patients [ 65 ( 54 – 74 ) years ] . The rate of comorbidities in aﬀected HCWs was 31 % ( 9 / 29 ) , which is signiﬁcantly lower than patients whose rate of comorbidities was 82 % ( 49 / 60 ) . The most common comorbidities among HCWs with SARS - CoV - 2 infection were asthma [ 3 ( 10 % ) ] , hypertension [ 2 ( 7 % ) ] and cancer [ 2 ( 7 % ) ] while those among patients were hypertension [ 28 ( 47 % ) ] , diabetes [ 16 ( 27 % ) ] and cardiovascular disease [ 10 ( 17 % ) ] . There was no diﬀerence in taking treatments known to cause severe COVID - 19 symptoms in the two cohorts . As in previous studies , being overweight deﬁned by a BMI > 25 was found to be a risk factor for a severe form of COVID - 19 ( mean 22 . 76 in asymptomatic and mild cases , 25 . 31 in moderate cases and 27 . 02 in severe cases , global p value = 0 . 0005 ) . In our study , there was the same rate of smokers in the three groups ( p = 0 . 1941 ) . Most of the infected HCWs were strictly asymptomatic [ 13 ( 45 % ) ] , but fever [ 9 ( 31 % ) ] , cough [ 7 ( 24 % ) ] , and headache [ 5 ( 17 % ) ] were prevalent . In COVID - 19 patients the three most common symptoms were dyspnea [ 44 ( 73 % ) ] , cough [ 38 ( 63 % ) ] , and fever [ 35 ( 58 % ) ] . The median time from the onset of ﬁrst symptoms of COVID - 19 to inclusion , otherwise the date of ﬁrst blood collection , was 7 ( 7 – 54 ) days for HCWs , 9 ( 5 – 14 ) days for patients with moderate COVID - 19 infection and 8 ( 5 – 10 ) days for severe Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 4 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al . HCWs and Immunity Against COVID - 19 cases . There was no diﬀerence in demographics , comorbidities , and symptoms between HCWs in COVID - dedicated units who were directly in contact with infected patients , from HCWs not in direct contact with patients ( data not shown ) . Humoral Immune Responses to SARS - CoV - 2 in Health Care Workers and Patients Kinetics of Speciﬁc Antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 in Severe COVID - 19 Patients We evaluated SARS - CoV - 2 speciﬁc antibody responses in 13 severe cases who recovered from the infection using serum samples collected at day 0 of the admission and at several follow - up points up to 2 months after hospital admission . The proportion of patients with positive SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgA and IgG at admission was 9 / 13 ( 69 % ) and 6 / 13 ( 46 % ) , TABLE 1 | SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate by function within the COVID unit .

During the ﬁrst 2 weeks after the admission for IgA and 4 weeks after the admission for IgG , titers for SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc antibodies were generally increasing . The IgA level then decreased , although it was still positive even at 7 weeks , while that of IgG remained relatively stable over time . Kinetics of Speciﬁc Antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 in Health Care Workers For eight infected HCWs with only IgA at inclusion , a second serum sample was collected 1 month later to verify IgG seroconversion . The levels of IgA and IgG antibodies speciﬁc to SARS - CoV - 2 increased signiﬁcantly between the two time points but only two individuals achieved the level of IgG positivity and one exhibited an undetermined result ( Figures 4C , D ) .

Detection of Speciﬁc Antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 in Household Members of Infected HCWs People sharing the same household as the 29 HCWs tested seropositive for SARS - CoV - 2 were also included in the study . Demographic and baseline characteristics of the seven volunteers included are depicted in Table 4 . Only two ( 29 % ) household members had speciﬁc antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . Both were the spouses of HCWs who had typical symptoms and a positive RT - PCR on NPS . Nonspeciﬁc Cellular Immune Response and Production of Type I and II Interferon in Health Care Workers and Patients Diagnosed With COVID - 19 To evaluate cellular immune responses of pauci - and asymptomatic HCWs , we stimulated whole blood samples from 29 HCWs and 60 patients ( with moderate and severe symptoms ) diagnosed with COVID - 19 with immune ligands and analyzed levels of the cytokines IFN - α and IFN - γ secreted by innate and adaptive cells . When compared to COVID - 19 patients with moderate or severe symptoms , innate and adaptive cells of infected HCWs , whether symptomatic or presenting mild symptoms , secreted signiﬁcantly more IFN - α [ infected HCWs : 602 . 00 ( 309 . 00 – 1335 . 00 ) pg / mL ; patients in IDU : 7 . 76 ( 0 . 58 – 51 . 53 ) pg / mL ; patients in ICU : 6 . 28 ( 1 . 06 – 74 . 30 ) pg / mL , p < 0 . 0001 ] and IFN - γ [ infected HCWs : 537 . 00 ( 115 . 50 – 886 . 00 ) IU / mL ; patients in IDU : 16 . 30 ( 7 . 45 – 50 . 50 ) IU / mL ; patients Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 6 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al .

Using ROC - Curve we deﬁned a threshold below 93 . 00 pg / ml for IFN - α and below 12 . 10 IU / mL for IFN - γ associated with hospitalization with a sensitivity of 84 and 51 % , respectively , and a speciﬁcity of 96 and 96 % , respectively , ( p < 0 . 0001 , AUC = 0 . 93 and p < 0 . 0001 , AUC = 0 . 92 , respectively , Supplementary Figure 1 ) . No diﬀerence in IFN - γ secretion was found between infected and uninfected HCWs ( p = 0 . 4684 , data not shown ) . Because of a higher proportion of women and young subjects among the HCWs compared to the hospitalized patients ( Tables 2 , 3 ) , we matched the HCWs and hospitalized patients for age and gender using a 2 : 1 ratio . After matching , we found the same results as before : infected HCWs produced signiﬁcantly more IFN - α and IFN - γ after nonspeciﬁc stimulation than patients with moderate or severe symptoms ( Figures 5C , D ) . Moreover , immune stimulation with CD3 agonist during active infection could induce immune cells apoptosis and explain the IFN defect measured . To verify this hypothesis , we perform a cell count before and after stimulation in 3 patients with COVID - 19 ( 2 severe and 1 moderate form ) . We did not observe any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the number of live and dead cells on anti - CD3 agonist stimulated blood compared to unstimulated blood ( p = 0 . 1732 , Supplementary Figure 2 ) . DISCUSSION SARS - CoV - 2 is an emerging virus responsible for the COVID - 19 pandemic that has spread rapidly around the world . The clinical features and immune responses , both humoral and cellular , of frontline health care workers infected with SARS - CoV - 2 have not yet been well described . To better understand the immune responses of this particularly exposed population , we compared the results to those obtained on a cohort of patients from the same hospital , and therefore from the same geographical location , and after matching on age and sex . As of May 26 , 2020 , of the 196 HCWs tested , 29 ( 15 % ) had speciﬁc antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 and 45 % of these 29 seropositive HCWs have been strictly asymptomatic . These results are comparable to those obtained in other studies performed on frontline HCWs , at the same time and under the same conditions with IgG serology coupled with IgA and / or IgM serology ( 15 – 17 ) . The signiﬁcant proportion of asymptomatic infected subjects transmitting the SARS - CoV - 2 ( 2 – 4 ) and the relatively high seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections among frontline HCWs ( 15 – 17 ) suggest that the use of screening strategies based on symptoms alone may not be eﬀective in preventing the introduction and spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in a hospital setting . However , in our study only the two HCWs who had typical COVID - 19 symptoms with a positive RT - PCR on NPS transmitted the virus to their spouses , Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 7 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al .

However , the small sample size prevented us from drawing statistically signiﬁcant conclusions . A large study conducted in the United States showed that out of 498 members of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case’s households , 57 % were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 ( 18 ) . Another study found , after analyzing viral spread among HCWs and residents of a nursing facility , a weak correlation between symptoms and viral shedding ( viral titers from respiratory tract ) , despite diﬃculty of determining precise dates of symptoms onset , especially if the subjects were pauci - symptomatic or with atypical symptoms ( 19 ) . These data strengthen current recommendations for expanded screening of HCWs and the universal use of face masks for all , especially in health care . In our study , all HCWs included worked in units caring for COVID - 19 patients , but there was no diﬀerence in the rate of SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence between HCWs directly or indirectly in contact with infected patients . Indeed , although the contamination conditions have not been clearly identiﬁed in our cohort of HCWs ( close contact with a COVID - 19 patient or with another infected HCW during professional activity , or contamination outside the hospital ) , the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in frontline HCWs is higher than in HCWs from non - COVID units ( 1 . 47 % on June 25 , 2020 in our hospital ) and is higher than the estimated seroprevalence in the general population [ 5 . 3 % on May 11 , 2020 in France ( 20 ) ] . However , the serologies carried out by occupational medicine in our hospital for staﬀ screening only included the determination of IgG and not IgA and IgM , responsible for a probable underestimation of the number of cases . Knowing the strength and duration of immunity after SARS - CoV - 2 infection would allow a better assessment of individual immune protection and aid in decision making on easing restrictions on physical distancing and wearing of a face mask . Several studies characterizing adaptive immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 infection have reported that most convalescents have detectable neutralizing antibodies , which correlate with the number of virus - speciﬁc T cells and decrease within 2 months after infection ( 5 , 6 , 11 , 21 ) . Conﬁrming these previous studies , we have shown a proportion of seroconversion in COVID - 19 patients of 100 % after 15 days of hospitalization . We then observed a decrease in SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgA antibodies titer from the 4th week , although it remained positive . The SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgG antibodies titer remained stable during the Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 8 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al .

HCWs , health care workers ; ICU , Intensive care unit ; IDU , Infectious diseases unit . 7 weeks of follow - up . In comparison , the IgA and IgG peaks of HCWs were lower , which is consistent with their mild symptoms ( 6 ) . IgA and IgG levels increased during HCWs follow - up , but most did not reach positivity for IgG levels ( IgG OD ratio ≥ 1 . 1 ) , as shown previously ( 6 ) . During SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the IgA response is earlier , stronger , and more persistent than the IgM response ( 22 , 23 ) , but its protective eﬃcacy is still poorly understood , especially when this IgA response is isolated . It is well known that the IgA response is a crucial ﬁrst - line defense in mucosal tissue , and SARS - CoV - 2 inﬁltrates mainly mucosal tissues . Sterlin et al . also suggested that IgA - mediated mucosal immunity is an essential defense mechanism against SARS - CoV - 2 that may reduce the contagion of human secretions and thus reduce viral transmission ( 24 ) . Thus , some authors have suggested that vaccination against SARS - CoV - 2 should trigger IgA responses ( 25 ) . This explains why we chose to study the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgA antibodies rather than IgM antibodies in our cohort . Additional serological surveys of more symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and longer follow - up are needed to determine the duration of the antibody response . Moreover , the low IgG levels found , or even the absence of IgG , in asymptomatic individuals reinforce the need for a serological survey including a search for IgA antibodies to study the actual infection rate . Our investigation showed impaired immune cellular responses , illustrated by a type I and II interferons deﬁciency , in patients with moderate and severe forms of COVID - 19 compared to HCWs with mild or asymptomatic forms . It is already well known that immune responses are altered by aging ( 26 ) , but these results remain signiﬁcant after matching for age and sex . Our data conﬁrm the results of the study by Hadjadj et al . ( 10 ) which suggests that a deﬁciency of type I interferon in the blood could be a characteristic of severe COVID - 19 and could justify therapeutic approaches combining the administration of interferon and anti - inﬂammatory therapies . However , it is well known that inﬂammation leads to a secondary deﬁcit of cellular immunity through the suppression of IL - 12 expression . As a result , this lack of type I and II interferons could also be secondary to the infection . Other studies showing mutations in type I IFN - related genes ( 27 ) or the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN ( 28 ) in patients with severe COVID - 19 support the hypothesis of a pre - existing immune deﬁciency predisposing to severe forms of COVID - 19 as described in other context ( 29 ) . Additional studies are needed to clarify this point . If the hypothesis of a pre - existing immune deﬁciency is conﬁrmed , the deﬁciency of type I and II interferons revealed after in vitro immune stimulation could be a functional blood immune biomarker predicting the severity of the COVID - 19 . In addition , this immune assay is applicable for routine use . Our study brings new data but has several limitations . First , diﬃculties in determining symptoms may have resulted Frontiers in Medicine | www . frontiersin . org 9 January 2021 | Volume 7 | Article 608804 Cremoni et al . HCWs and Immunity Against COVID - 19 in misclassiﬁcation of the severity of COVID - 19 in some HCWs and patients . In fact , the collection of HCWs’ symptoms was done using a self - questionnaire , which can lead to a memorization bias or on the contrary an overestimation of possible symptoms in this particular context of a pandemic . In addition , some patients were probably wrongly classiﬁed in the “moderate form” subgroup because they were hospitalized in IDU because of their advanced age , severe comorbidities , or social isolation and not because of the severity of their COVID - 19 symptoms . Second , young women represent most health care professionals , a bias that we tried to cushion by performing age and gender matches with patients . Third , this investigation is single - center , carried out only in units caring for COVID - 19 patients , resulting in a small sample size . More studies are needed to better understand the immune response of this population continuously exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 infection since the start of the pandemic . A longer clinical and serological follow - up is essential to investigate the eﬃcacy of the protection induced by an isolated IgA response and study the persistence of the antibodies over time . Thus , HCWs included in this study will beneﬁt from extended clinical and serological follow - up . Defense against SARS - CoV - 2 requires both humoral and cellular immune responses . The more detailed study of the immune response in HCWs , highly exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 for a prolonged period of time , could provide a better understanding of the alteration of the immune system of patients with a severe form , and thus manage them better . This knowledge could also allow us to adapt the exposition of HCWs according to their immune proﬁle and the treatment in case of infection preventing the evolution to a severe form of COVID - 19 combining the administration of interferon and anti - inﬂammatory therapies .
