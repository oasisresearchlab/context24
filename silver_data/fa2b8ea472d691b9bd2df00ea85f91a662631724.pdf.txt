Importantly , some 20 mechanisms have been identified and characterized by following virus internalization 21 into cells . This includes a novel endocytic pathway exploited by human 22 papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) . However , its cellular role and mechanism of 23 endocytic vacuole formation remain unclear . Here , HPV16 was used as a tool to 24 examine the mechanistic execution of vesicle formation by combining systematic 25 perturbation of cellular processes with electron and video microscopy . Our results 26 indicate cargo uptake by uncoated , inward - budding pits facilitated by the membrane 27 bending retromer protein SNX2 . Actin polymerization - driven vesicle scission is 28 promoted by WASH , an actin regulator typically not found at the plasma membrane . 29 Uncovering a novel role of WASH in endocytosis , we propose to term the new 30 pathway WASH - mediated endocytosis ( WASH - ME ) . 31 32 3 Introduction 33 Cells internalize extracellular ligands , fluids , plasma membrane lipids and receptors 34 by endocytosis . This is crucial for cellular and organismal homeostasis , signal 35 transduction , intercellular communication , immune response , development and 36 neurotransmission ( Schmid and Conner , 2003 ) . Several endocytic mechanisms exist 37 that are distinguished by diverse criteria . Morphologically , cargo is engulfed either by 38 outward membrane protrusions ( macropinocytosis , phagocytosis ) or by inward 39 budding pits that may or may not display a visible coat in electron microscopy ( EM ) 40 ( e . g . clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , glycosphingolipid enriched endocytic 41 carriers ( GEEC ) ) ( Heuser and Evans , 1980 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . The cellular 42 machinery executing endocytic vacuole formation and the destination of endocytic 43 cargo further define the identity of endocytic pathways ( Doherty and McMahon , 44 2009 ) . For instance , macropinocytosis occurs by growth factor - induced , actin - driven 45 protrusions that form large vacuoles upon backfolding with help of the 46 Bin1 / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) protein C - terminal binding protein 1 ( CtBP1 ) ( Liberali et 47 al . , 2008 ; Lim and Gleeson , 2011 ) . Of the inward budding mechanisms , CME occurs 48 by sequential recruitment of adaptor proteins ( AP ) such as AP2 and the clathrin coat . 49 Dynamin - 2 mediated scission then leads to vacuole formation ( McMahon and 50 Boucrot , 2011 ; Merrifield and Kaksonen , 2014 ) . In contrast , caveolar endocytosis 51 occurs by preassembled coat structures ( Pelkmans et al . , 2004 ; Hayer et al . , 2010 ; 52 Stoeber et al . , 2016 ) . Another criterium is cargo specificity . For instance , 53 macropinocytosis and CME are responsible for bulk fluid uptake or specific 54 membrane receptor internalization , respectively . A subset of GEEC is specifically 55 responsible for lectin uptake ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) . In addition to the well - 56 established pathways , a number of less well understood endocytic mechanisms have 57 emerged . Only little information is available on which cellular processes they 58 4 regulate , or on how vesicles are formed , as they are defined by their independence 59 of classical endocytic regulators such as clathrin , caveolin , dynamin - 2 , or cholesterol 60 ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . Importantly , several of these mechanisms have been 61 identified by following the internalization of viruses such as lymphocytic 62 choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) , influenza A virus ( IAV ) , and human papillomavirus 63 type 16 ( HPV16 ) ( Rust et al . , 2004 ; Quirin et al . , 2008 ; Mercer , Schelhaas and 64 Helenius , 2010 ; Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . 65 66 As intracellular parasites , viruses depend on host cells for their life - cycle . This is 67 particularly important during the initial phase of infection termed entry , during which 68 viruses deliver their genome to the site of replication within cells . As virus particles 69 lack locomotive abilities , they strictly rely on cellular transport mechanisms to cross 70 the plasma membrane , the cytosol , or the nuclear envelope . Following viral particles 71 en route to the site of replication thus allows to study cellular mechanisms exploited 72 by viruses ( Marsh and Helenius , 2006 ) . Most viruses make use of endocytosis to 73 overcome the plasma membrane . Among them is HPV16 , a small non - enveloped 74 DNA virus and the leading cause of cervical cancer ( de Sanjose et al . , 2010 ; 75 Mirabello et al . , 2017 ) . HPV16 initially infects basal keratinocytes of squamous 76 mucosal epithelia , whereas completion of its life cycle requires suprabasal 77 keratinocyte differentiation ( Doorbar , 2005 ) . For entry , it utilizes a unique endocytic 78 pathway for which little to no mechanistic information exists ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . 79 As viruses strictly hijack existing endocytic mechanisms , the intriguing question 80 remains which cellular cargo targets this pathway . Uptake of HPV16 into cells is slow 81 and asynchronous , with individual virus internalization events occurring over a period 82 of many hours after binding ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ; Becker et al . , 2018 ) . Binding to 83 heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) initiates crucial structural changes in the 84 5 virus capsid that allow transfer to an internalization receptor ( complex ) to induce 85 uptake ( Giroglou et al . , 2001 ; Richards et al . , 2006 ; Selinka et al . , 2007 ; Cerqueira et 86 al . , 2013 , 2015 ; Becker et al . , 2018 ) . Uptake involves growth factor receptors 87 ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ; Surviladze , Dziduszko and Ozbun , 2012 ; Bannach et al . , 88 2020 ) , integrin α 6 ( Evander et al . , 1997 ; Yoon et al . , 2001 ; Scheffer et al . , 2013 ) , 89 tetraspanins cluster of differentiation ( CD ) 151 and CD63 ( Scheffer et al . , 2013 ; Fast 90 et al . , 2018 ) , and annexin A2 heterotetramer ( Woodham et al . , 2012 ; Dziduszko and 91 Ozbun , 2013 ) . These proteins are thought to constitute specifically functionalized 92 tetraspanin - enriched microdomains termed HPV16 entry platforms that induce 93 uptake and co - internalize with the virus ( Raff et al . , 2013 ; Florin and Lang , 2018 ) . 94 After endocytosis , HPV16 traffics through the endosomal system , accompanied by 95 partial capsid disassembly ( Smith et al . , 2008 ; Spoden et al . , 2008 ; Bienkowska - 96 Haba et al . , 2012 ) . From endosomes , the virus is routed to the trans - Golgi network 97 by retrograde transport ( Day et al . , 2013 ; Lipovsky et al . , 2013 ) and reaches its site 98 of replication , the nucleus , after nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis ( Pyeon 99 et al . , 2009 ; Aydin et al . , 2014 ) . 100 101 HPV16 exploits an endocytic pathway independent of a long list of prominent 102 endocytic regulators including clathrin , caveolin , dynamin and cholesterol . Instead , it 103 depends on sodium / proton exchange , actin polymerization and signaling via 104 epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , phosphatidylinositol ‐ 4 , 5 ‐ bisphosphate 105 3 ‐ kinase , p21 - activated kinase 1 , protein kinase C , and Abelson tyrosine - protein 106 kinase 2 ( Abl2 ) ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ; Bannach et al . , 2020 ) . It remains largely 107 elusive how these factors contribute to endocytic vesicle formation . We know , 108 however , that EGFR and Abl2 regulate endocytosis induction and pit maturation , 109 respectively ( Bannach et al . , 2020 ) . As such , the requirements for HPV16 uptake are 110 6 somewhat reminiscent of macropinocytosis , during which sodium / proton exchange 111 regulates large actin - driven membrane protrusions to engulf bulk extracellular 112 material ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Mercer , Schelhaas and Helenius , 2010 ) . 113 However , HPV16 endocytosis typically involves small vesicles of about 60 - 100 nm 114 diameter that contain single virus particles , and that are generated independently of 115 cholesterol and the classical Rho - like GTPases cell division cycle 42 ( Cdc42 ) , rat 116 sarcoma ( Ras ) - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , and Ras homolog 117 family member 1 ( RhoA ) ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ; Bannach et al . , 2020 ) . Perhaps , it 118 represents a small - scale version of macropinocytosis , i . e . “micropinocytosis” 119 ( Helenius , 2018 , 2020 ) . 120 121 Here , we used HPV16 as cargo of this unique endocytic pathway to address how 122 vesicles would be mechanistically formed . We demonstrated that HPV16 123 endocytosis occurred via uncoated vesicles severed from the plasma membrane by 124 actin - related proteins ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex - dependent branched actin polymerization . 125 Interestingly , Arp2 / 3 complex activation did not involve nucleation promoting factors 126 ( NPFs ) typically found at the plasma membrane , but the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome 127 protein ( WASP ) and suppressor of cAMP receptor ( Scar ) homologue ( WASH ) , a well - 128 known regulator of endosomal cargo sorting . WASH was recruited to endocytic sites 129 at the same time as sorting nexin 2 ( SNX2 ) , a BAR domain protein of the endosomal 130 retromer complex , which supposedly assists in membrane bending during endocytic 131 vesicle formation . Providing insights into the mechanism of a unique endocytic 132 pathway , our findings for the first time conclusively demonstrated a direct 133 involvement of WASH in endocytosis and implicated retromer components in 134 endocytic cargo uptake . 135 136 7 Results 137 HPV16 endocytosis occurred via uncoated , inward budding vesicles 138 To assess how this unique mechanism generates endocytic vesicles , we employed 139 HPV16 as trackable cargo in correlative light and EM ( CLEM ) . Our goal was to 140 visualize different stages of endocytic vacuole formation and to address whether 141 potential coat structures were associated with these vacuoles , similar to clathrin - 142 coated pits or caveolae . For this , fluorescent virus particles were correlated with 143 structures on the cytosolic leaflet of plasma membrane sheets analyzed by 144 transmission EM ( TEM ) of metal replicas ( Heuser and Evans , 1980 ; Sochacki et al . , 145 2014 ; Bucher et al . , 2018 ) . As expected , different stages of clathrin - coated pit 146 formation were readily observable at sites distinct from virus localizations ( Figure 147 1A ) . For HPV16 , about 20 % of viruses were associated with no obvious structure , 148 likely representing virus binding to HSPGs prior to engagement of HPV16 entry 149 platforms and endocytosis induction . A considerable proportion ( 31 % ) was correlated 150 with dense actin network patches ( Figure 1B ) . These may constitute anchoring 151 structures for tetraspanin microdomains / HPV entry platforms , either prior to or during 152 induction of endocytosis ( Schelhaas et al . , 2008 ; Ménager and Littman , 2016 ) . 153 Importantly , inward - budding structures at virus sites were readily observed and 154 classified into stages of vesicle formation in analogy to CME ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . 155 Designated as early stage , 14 % of virions were associated with roughened plasma 156 membrane patches representing initial curvature formation ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . 157 Small invaginations ( 100 - 150 nm in diameter ) were assigned as intermediate stage , 158 and represented pit maturation ( 13 % ) . Fully rounded invaginations of 80 - 100 nm 159 ( 22 % ) were classified as late - stage endocytic pits ready for scission ( Figures 1A and 160 1B ) . Notably , all invaginations were devoid of a discernable coat or other regular 161 structures ( Figure 1A ) . Thus , HPV16 endocytosis occurred by a stepwise , inward 162 8 budding process , in which endocytic vacuoles were formed without observable 163 contribution of a coat structure . 164 165 Actin polymerization facilitates HPV16 endocytosis ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . 166 Accordingly , perturbation of actin assembly by cytochalasin D ( cytoD ) reduced 167 HPV16 infection ( Figure 1C ) . To analyze how defective actin assembly impacts the 168 steps of endocytic pit formation , we used CLEM of cytoD - treated cells . As expected , 169 the actin network population was no longer detectable ( Figure 1B ) . However , notably 170 all stages of membrane invaginations were present to a similar extend in cytoD - and 171 untreated samples ( Figure 1B ) . This indicated not only that pit formation was 172 independent of actin polymerization , but also that actin polymerization was 173 expendable for the induction of endocytic pits responsible for HPV16 uptake . In 174 addition , virus - correlated tubular structures devoid of an apparent coat newly 175 appeared in cytoD - treated cells ( Figure 1B ) . In fact , these tubular membrane 176 invaginations were filled with virus particles ( Figure 1D ) . This suggested a fully 177 functional formation of endocytic structures , but a failure in vesicle scission from the 178 plasma membrane . In conclusion , scission but not induction and membrane 179 invagination were facilitated by polymerized or polymerizing actin filaments during 180 HPV16 endocytosis . 181 182 Actin polymerization coincided with HPV16 endocytosis 183 Consistent with actin dynamics aiding vesicle scission in HPV16 uptake , we 184 observed actin signals at the neck of constricted endocytic pits in immunogold 185 labelling EM ( Figure 2A ) . To gain insights into how the dynamics of actin at virus 186 entry sites may facilitate vesicle scission , we employed live cell TIRF microscopy 187 ( TIRF - M ) . In TIRF - M , only the basal plasma membrane is observable . Hence , HPV16 188 9 endocytosis into the cell interior was denoted by a rapid loss of virus signal ( Figures 189 2B and 2C , Suppl . Movie 1 ) . Virus signal loss correlated with an increase of 190 filamentous actin signals ( Figures 2B and 2C , Suppl . Movie 1 ) indicating actin 191 polymerization at the time of scission . Detailed analysis of intensity profiles revealed 192 that virus signal loss occurred for about 4 s ( Figures 2C and 2D , Suppl . Movie 1 ) . 193 The onset of actin polymerization was somewhat variable . However , the increase in 194 actin signals was on average initiated 7 s prior to virus internalization , peaked just 195 before virus uptake , and decreased thereafter ( Figures 2C and 2D , Suppl . Movie 1 ) . 196 The dynamics of actin polymerization resembled dynamin recruitment during scission 197 in CME , starting about 20 s prior to loss of the clathrin signal from the plasma 198 membrane ( Figures S1A - S1C , Suppl . Movie 2 ) ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . Since 199 dynamin is dispensable for HPV16 endocytosis ( Spoden et al . , 2008 ; Schelhaas et 200 al . , 2012 ) , similar recruitment profiles suggested that actin functionally replaced 201 dynamin as a scission factor . Moreover , the dynamics of polymerization indicated 202 that polymerized actin did not merely serve as anchor for other scission factors , but 203 was specifically induced for and actively contributed to endocytic vesicle scission as 204 reported for other endocytic mechanisms ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Pelkmans , Püntener 205 and Helenius , 2002 ; Mooren , Galletta and Cooper , 2012 ) . 206 207 Branched actin polymerization regulated HPV16 endocytosis 208 To understand the mechanism of actin polymerization for HPV16 endocytosis , we 209 investigated the involvement of branched versus unbranched actin filaments . Formin - 210 mediated unbranched actin polymerization was perturbed by SMIFH2 , a small 211 molecule inhibitor binding the formin homology 2 domain in formins ( Rizvi et al . , 212 2009 ) . SMIFH2 treatment dose dependently decreased vesicular stomatitis virus 213 ( VSV ) infection , confirming the role of formins in actin - dependent CME of VSV 214 10 ( Figure 3A ) ( Cureton et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , SMIFH2 did not affect HPV16 infection 215 ( Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , HPV16 infection was largely unaffected by siRNA - 216 mediated depletion of individual formins ( Figure S2 ) . However , sequestering the 217 Arp2 / 3 complex as key regulator of branched actin polymerization by overexpression 218 of the Arp2 / 3 binding domain of WASP and WASP - family verprolin - homologous 219 protein ( WAVE ) ( Scar - WA ) ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) strongly reduced HPV16 220 infection compared to cells expressing a control lacking the Arp2 / 3 binding domain 221 ( Scar - W ) ( Figure 3B ) . In line with a requirement of branched actin polymerization , 222 RNA interference ( RNAi ) with Arp3 expression reduced infection by about 80 % 223 ( Figure 3C ) compared to cells transfected with a non - targeting control ( ctrl . ) . 224 Similarly , vaccinia virus ( VV ) infection by macropinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 225 2008 ; Mazzon and Mercer , 2014 ) was reduced upon Arp3 depletion , whereas Semliki 226 Forest virus ( SFV ) uptake by actin - independent CME ( Marsh and Helenius , 1980 ; 227 Marsh , Kielian and Helenius , 1984 ; DeTulleo and Kirchhausen , 1998 ) was even 228 increased ( Figure 3C ) . Taken together , active branched but not unbranched actin 229 polymerization was crucial for HPV16 infection . 230 231 To verify the impact on HPV16 uptake , we employed a bona fide virus endocytosis 232 assay . For this , HPV16 covalently labelled with the pH - sensitive dye pHrodo was 233 used , which gives rise to fluorescence only upon delivery to acidic endosomal 234 organelles ( Figure 3D ) ( Ventayol and Schelhaas , 2015 ; Becker et al . , 2018 ) . 235 Depletion of Arp3 reduced virus internalization by about 70 % ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , 236 branched actin polymerization was essential for HPV16 endocytosis . 237 238 WASH was the major NPF in HPV16 infection 239 11 Since the Arp2 / 3 complex is inherently inactive , how is it activated for virus uptake ? 240 Several NPFs with distinct cellular functions and localizations regulate Arp2 / 3 241 complex activity ( Stradal and Scita , 2006 ; Rottner , Hänisch and Campellone , 2010 ) . 242 To identify , which NPF acted during HPV16 infection , we employed RNAi . Depletion 243 of the most prominent actin regulators in endocytic processes , neuronal WASP ( N - 244 WASP ) and WAVE isoforms 1 or 2 , ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 245 2003 ; Chadda et al . , 2007 ) , did not alter HPV16 infection ( Figures S3A - S3C and 246 S3F ) . N - WASP RNAi results were confirmed in cells stably expressing a short hairpin 247 RNA ( data not shown ) . Taken together , N - WASP , WAVE1 and 2 were dispensable 248 for HPV16 uptake . Consequently , a potential involvement of NPFs typically not found 249 at the plasma membrane was assessed . Neither depletion of junction mediating and 250 regulatory protein , p53 cofactor ( JMY ) , a regulator of DNA damage response and cell 251 migration ( Shikama et al . , 1999 ; Zuchero et al . , 2009 ) , nor depletion of WASP 252 homolog associated with actin , Golgi membranes and microtubules ( WHAMM ) , which 253 is involved in the secretory pathway ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ) , impaired infection with 254 HPV16 ( Figures S3D - S3F ) . However , depletion of WASH , a well - known actin 255 regulator of endosomal cargo sorting ( Linardopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Derivery et al . , 256 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ) , strongly reduced HPV16 infection , whereas VV 257 uptake by macropinocytosis was only mildly affected ( Figures 4A and S3F ) . In 258 conclusion , WASH was the major NPF during HPV16 infection rather than NPFs 259 typically found at the plasma membrane . 260 261 WASH acted during late stages of HPV16 endocytic vesicle formation 262 To date , no evidence exists that WASH facilitates endocytic vesicle formation . 263 However , since it was the only NPF important for HPV16 infection , we hypothesized 264 a novel role of WASH in regulating actin polymerization for endocytic vacuole 265 12 formation . Consistently , silencing of WASH resulted in a strong decrease of HPV16 266 uptake ( Figure 4B ) . In corroboration , HPV16 infection was completely abrogated in 267 CRISPR / Cas9 - derived mouse fibroblast WASH knock - out ( KO ) cells ( NIH - 3T3 , 268 Figures 4C and S4C ) . Ectopic expression of wild type WASH rescued HPV16 269 infection in these cells ( Figure 4C and S4A ) , whereas expression of WASH lacking 270 the WASP - homology 2 , central and acidic ( WCA ) domain crucial for Arp2 / 3 complex 271 activation did not ( Figure S4A ) . This indicated that WASH was an essential actin 272 regulator during HPV16 uptake . In support , HPV16 infection was also strongly 273 reduced in human osteosarcoma WASH KO cells ( U2OS ) ( Figures S4B and S4C ) , 274 which not only supported the importance of WASH for HPV16 infection , but also 275 suggested the functional existence of WASH - dependent endocytosis in cells derived 276 from different tissues and species . 277 278 After confirming that HPV16 binding to cells was unaffected in WASH KO cells 279 ( Figures S4D and S4E ) , we investigated how loss of WASH would interfere with 280 HPV16 endocytosis by analyzing the morphology of virus - containing pits in ultra - thin 281 section TEM . Compared to wild type cells , the endocytic pits were morphologically 282 unaltered in WASH KO cells , i . e . , they were fully formed and partially constricted at 283 the neck ( Figure 4D ) . Thus , early stages of endocytic vesicle formation such as 284 induction and membrane invagination were independent of WASH . Strikingly , the 285 average number of virus containing plasma membrane invaginations more than 286 doubled in the absence of WASH ( Figures 4D ) . Hence , HPV16 endocytosis was 287 stalled at a late stage in WASH KO cells . Taken together , the roles of actin 288 polymerization in vesicle scission , of WASH as the single NPF to promote actin 289 polymerization , and the loss of WASH stalling HPV16 endocytosis at a late stage of 290 13 vesicle formation strongly suggested that WASH regulated endocytic vesicle scission 291 but not endocytic pit formation . 292 293 To directly stimulate vesicle scission , WASH would have to be present at virus 294 endocytosis sites . To probe recruitment of WASH to HPV16 entry platforms marked 295 by HA - CD151 ( Scheffer et al . , 2013 ) , we employed the proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) 296 ( Söderberg et al . , 2006 ) . A small fraction of virus particles co - localized with the PLA 297 signal of WASH and CD151 ( Figure S5 ) , indicating that WASH indeed acted at virus 298 entry sites . A limited association of HPV16 with WASH / CD151 structures was 299 expected due to the highly asynchronous virus uptake over many hours , during which 300 only few viruses interact with entry platforms at any given time ( Schelhaas et al . , 301 2012 ; Becker et al . , 2018 ) . To more conclusively demonstrate recruitment of WASH 302 to virus entry sites and to gain information on recruitment dynamics , WASH 303 association in relation to uptake of HPV16 was analyzed by live cell TIRF - M . WASH 304 was detected together with virus signals for more than 50 seconds prior to HPV16 305 uptake and co - internalized with the virus ( Figures 4E and 4F , Suppl . Movie 3 ) . Thus , 306 WASH was recruited already early during vesicle formation , although it likely exerted 307 its NPF function only during scission ( Figure 4D ) . To further investigate the stage of 308 WASH recruitment to virus endocytic sites , we performed immunogold labelling of 309 WASH . WASH was observed in close proximity to virus particles bound to flat plasma 310 membrane regions ( binding ) , slightly curved membranes associated with virus 311 particles ( early pit ) , and with fully formed HPV16 endocytic pits ( late pit ) ( Figure 4G ) . 312 In summary , our data supports a model in which WASH acts in a novel function 313 during endocytosis : WASH was recruited to the plasma membrane early during pit 314 formation , stayed associated during all stages of pit maturation ( Figure 4G ) , and 315 14 acted at a late stage ( Figure 4D ) to initiate actin polymerization for vesicle scission 316 during HPV16 endocytosis . 317 318 The retromer BAR protein SNX2 facilitated HPV16 endocytosis 319 How is WASH then recruited to virus entry sites ? On endosomes , WASH recruitment 320 occurs by interaction of the WASH regulatory complex with the retromer complex 321 ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Harbour , Breusegem and Seaman , 2012 ; Jia et al . , 322 2012 ) . In line with its well established function in endosomal cargo sorting , the 323 retromer has also been implicated in HPV16 retrograde transport to the Golgi 324 ( Lipovsky et al . , 2013 ; Popa et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . 325 326 To analyze whether retromer components would play an additional role in HPV16 327 uptake , we initially used retro - 2 , a selective inhibitor of retrograde trafficking of e . g . 328 Shiga toxin B from endosomes to the Golgi ( Bujny et al . , 2007 ; Popoff et al . , 2007 ; 329 Stechmann et al . , 2010 ) . As expected , retro - 2 dose - dependently reduced HPV16 330 infection ( Figure 5A ) ( Lipovsky et al . , 2013 ) , while herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV - 1 ) 331 infection was unaffected ( Nicola et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 5A ) . HPV16 binding was 332 unchanged in presence of retro - 2 ( Figure S6A ) . Hence , decreased infection was not 333 a consequence of perturbed recycling and reduced receptor presentation . Next , we 334 dissected possible effects of retro - 2 on HPV16 endocytosis and retrograde 335 trafficking , respectively . First , we selectively targeted trafficking in an inhibitor swap 336 experiment . HPV16 uptake was allowed in presence of NH 4 Cl , a weak base that 337 raises the endosomal pH and prevents onward trafficking of HPV16 ( Day , Lowy and 338 Schiller , 2003 ; Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . At 12 h post infection ( p . i . ) . , when a large 339 fraction of virus had reached endosomes , NH 4 Cl was swapped for retro - 2 to prevent 340 retrograde transport . HPV16 infection was dose - dependently decreased ( Figure 5B ) , 341 15 in line with the requirement for HPV16 endosome - to - Golgi transport ( Lipovsky et al . , 342 2013 ) . To assess potential additional effects of retro - 2 on HPV16 endocytosis , we 343 analyzed virus uptake in an infectious internalization assay . Cells were infected in 344 presence of retro - 2 for 12 h , when extracellular virions were inactivated by a high pH 345 wash and infection by already internalized virions was allowed to continue in absence 346 of retro - 2 . Uptake of infectious HPV16 was dose - dependently reduced by about 70 % 347 in presence of retro - 2 ( Figure 5C ) . In conclusion , retro - 2 inhibited both retrograde 348 trafficking ( Figure 5B ) and HPV16 uptake by endocytosis ( Figure 5C ) . To determine 349 the stage of pit formation affected by retro - 2 treatment , we performed ultra - thin 350 section TEM . Since retro - 2 decreased the number of virus - containing endocytic pits 351 by 90 % , it is likely that retro - 2 inhibited the initiation of pit formation ( Figure 5D ) . In 352 conclusion , components of the retrograde trafficking machinery already acted during 353 early steps of HPV16 endocytosis . 354 355 To specifically address a role for the retromer in either initiation of pit formation or 356 membrane curvature formation , we targeted retromer components by RNAi . The 357 retromer is composed of a cargo - selective complex ( CSC ) of vacuolar protein sorting 358 ( Vps ) 26 , Vps29 , and Vps35 , and a dimeric membrane - bending subunit consisting of 359 sorting nexin BAR proteins SNX1 / SNX2 and SNX5 / SNX6 ( Seaman , 2012 ) . As 360 previously observed , RNAi against Vps26 , Vps29 and SNX2 strongly reduced 361 infection and suggested that both retromer subunits were required for HPV16 362 infection ( Figures 6A and S6B ) ( Lipovsky et al . , 2013 ; Siddiqa et al . , 2018 ) . As 363 control and to differentiate HPV16 endocytosis from macropinocytosis , depletion of 364 CtBP1 , a prominent BAR domain containing regulator of macropinocytosis ( Liberali et 365 al . , 2008 ; Valente , Luini and Corda , 2013 ) , did not impair HPV16 infection ( Figure 366 6A ) . 367 16 368 Since previous work indicates that depletion of Vps29 is expendable for HPV16 369 uptake but demonstrates an essential role of the CSC in HPV16 endosomal 370 trafficking ( Lipovsky et al . , 2013 , 2015 ; Popa et al . , 2015 ; Xie et al . , 2020 ) , the CSC 371 is unlikely to facilitate HPV16 endocytosis . Recent evidence suggests that retromer 372 BAR proteins can act independent of the CSC on endosomes ( Kvainickas et al . , 373 2017 ; Simonetti et al . , 2017 ; Yong et al . , 2020 ) . Hence , we focused our attention on 374 the role of SNX2 . While binding of HPV16 to cells was unaffected upon knockdown of 375 SNX2 ( Figures S6C and S6D ) , HPV16 uptake was significantly reduced thereby 376 strengthening a potential role of SNX2 in endocytosis ( Figure 6B ) . 377 378 Similar to WASH , a direct involvement of SNX2 in endocytosis necessitates its 379 presence at endocytic sites . During live cell TIRF - M , SNX2 and HPV16 signals co - 380 localized for more than 50 seconds prior to virus uptake and co - internalized 381 ( Figures 6C and 6D , Suppl . Movie 4 ) . Thus , SNX2 resembled WASH dynamics 382 during endocytosis . Immunogold labeling confirmed that SNX2 was indeed present at 383 the same endocytic stages than WASH , namely from virus binding to late stages of 384 pit formation ( Figure 6E ) . Thus , these findings indicated a novel function of the 385 retromer protein SNX2 in facilitating HPV16 endocytosis , likely through membrane 386 bending and / or recruitment of WASH to endocytic sites . 387 17 Discussion 388 HPV16 uptake occurs by a unique endocytic mechanism , which is distinguished from 389 other mechanisms predominantly in negative terms , i . e . , clathrin - , caveolin - , 390 dynamin - , cholesterol - independent and morphologically distinct from 391 macropinocytosis . This work provides evidence for a mechanistic model , in which 392 HPV16 is internalized by inward budding of uncoated endocytic vesicles . Pit 393 formation is facilitated by recruitment of the membrane bending retromer unit and 394 WASH , the latter of which stimulates branched actin polymerization for scission 395 ( Figure 7 ) . Hence , our work not only describes an unexpected direct function of 396 SNX2 and WASH in endocytosis , but also delineates that this mechanism follows a 397 stepwise itinerary similar to CME and distinct from macropinocytosis ( Figure 7 ) . 398 Since WASH has neither been described at the plasma membrane nor been 399 attributed to any other endocytic pathway , it defines the molecular identity of the 400 unique endocytic mechanism . Thus , we propose to call this pathway WASH - 401 mediated endocytosis ( WASH - ME ) . 402 403 The endocytic landscape includes a variety of pathways , in which endocytic vesicle 404 formation is achieved by different machineries . These pathways typically differ in 405 morphology , key cargos , and molecular features ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . 406 WASH - ME falls in the category of pathways that form endocytic vacuoles by inward 407 budding of the plasma membrane in distinguishable steps . Thus , vesicles are formed 408 by de novo assembly of the endocytic machinery in a modular manner , a mode 409 comparable to CME ( Figure 7 ) . Vesicle formation is completed by a scission event . 410 In many endocytic pathways , this is mediated by the large GTPase dynamin . During 411 CME , dynamin polymerizes to form a collar that compresses the vesicle neck by an 412 extensively discussed mechanism leading to membrane fission ( Hinshaw and 413 18 Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Morlot and Roux , 414 2013 ) . In contrast , WASH - ME occurs independently of dynamin ( Spoden et al . , 2008 ; 415 Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) but involves actin polymerization , which coincided with 416 vesicle scission in a timely fashion that resembled dynamin recruitment during CME 417 ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Merrifield , 2004 ) . Hence , actin most likely facilitates vesicle 418 scission by a force - driven mechanism rather than as anchoring structure for other 419 scission factors . How actin polymerization creates the force for vesicle scission 420 remains elusive . However , in analogy to observations from CME or endocytosis in 421 Xenopus oocytes , actin polymerization towards the vesicle neck may serve to 422 constrict and propel the vesicle away from the plasma membrane ( Bement , Sokac 423 and Mandato , 2003 ; Sokac et al . , 2003 ; Collins et al . , 2011 ) . 424 425 Endocytic vesicle scission is tightly coupled to membrane remodeling ( Dawson , Legg 426 and Machesky , 2006 ; Shin et al . , 2008 ) . This is often coordinated by BAR domain 427 proteins , which sense and stabilize membrane bending by intrinsic curvature ( Gallop 428 et al . , 2006 ; Jao et al . , 2010 ; Qualmann , Koch and Kessels , 2011 ) . For instance , 429 SNX9 not only participates in dynamin recruitment ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) , but also 430 recruits and directly activates the NPF N - WASP for vesicle scission during CME 431 ( Yarar , Waterman - Storer and Schmid , 2007 ; Shin et al . , 2008 ) . Since we 432 demonstrated similar dynamics of SNX2 and WASH at virus entry sites during 433 WASH - ME , perhaps SNX2 aids WASH function in a similar fashion . However , 434 whereas SNX9 and N - WASP are recruited at late stages of CME ( Taylor , Perrais and 435 Merrifield , 2011 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) , SNX2 and WASH are already present 436 much prior to vesicle scission . Despite the early recruitment , our findings indicated 437 that WASH promoted actin polymerization only late during vesicle scission . Hence , in 438 contrast to CME , recruitment and activation of the NPF are likely uncoupled in 439 19 WASH - ME . How SNX2 recruitment and WASH activation are induced for WASH - ME 440 is unclear . In analogy to their function on endosomes , however , binding of SNX2 to 441 specific phosphoinositides ( Zhong et al . , 2002 ; Carlton et al . , 2005 ) and 442 posttranslational modifications of WASH ( Hao et al . , 2013 ) are likely involved in their 443 function during WASH - ME . In line with this notion , WASH - ME is controlled by several 444 protein and lipid kinases ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ; Bannach et al . , 2020 ) . 445 446 How WASH - ME is induced by ligand - receptor interactions is an intriguing question . In 447 addition to mechanistic insights , it would point to the cellular role of WASH - ME and 448 the cargo it internalizes . Likely , WASH - ME is induced only during specific cell states , 449 as WASH is infrequently observed at the plasma membrane . It is reasonable to 450 assume that HPV16 exploits a pathway that is highly active during infection of target 451 cells . These are basal keratinocytes of the mucosal epidermis that become 452 accessible to the virus upon epidermal wounding ( Doorbar , 2005 ; Roberts et al . , 453 2007 ; Aksoy , Gottschalk and Meneses , 2017 ) . Wounding and other cellular 454 responses stimulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cell migration , which 455 are accompanied by the remodeling of cell - matrix adhesion complexes , such as focal 456 adhesions and hemidesmosomes ( HDs ) ( Jones , Hopkinson and Goldfinger , 1998 ; 457 Borradori and Sonnenberg , 1999 ; Webb , Parsons and Horwitz , 2002 ; Ezratty , 458 Partridge and Gundersen , 2005 ; Walko , Castañón and Wiche , 2015 ) . To date , little is 459 known about the dynamics of HD remodeling during cell migration , but HD containing 460 plasma membrane domains can be rapidly endocytosed upon detachment from the 461 underlying extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( Owaribe et al . , 1990 ) . Since HDs contain 462 integrin α 6 and CD151 , which are part of the HPV16 entry platform ( Scheffer et al . , 463 2013 ; Walko , Castañón and Wiche , 2015 ; Mikuli č i ć et al . , 2019 ) , WASH - ME may 464 promote HD uptake during wound healing to aid cell migration and thereby wound 465 20 closure . Another essential process during wound healing is matrix remodeling . 466 Interestingly , WASH was previously implicated in apical endocytosis of extracellular 467 material in the Drosophila airway epithelium during embryogenesis ( Tsarouhas et al . , 468 2019 ) . Hence , WASH - ME could also contribute to matrix remodeling as a specialized 469 mechanism for internalization of extracellular material . 470 471 While extensive future research will have to address the cellular role of WASH - ME , 472 its role in pathogen invasion may be of considerable interest as well . For instance , 473 WASH is recruited to the plasma membrane during Salmonella infection presumably 474 serving as one of several entry pathways ( Hänisch et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , WASH 475 regulatory complex protein family with sequence similarity 21 co - localizes with a 476 subset of VV particles in plasma membrane lipid rafts ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , 477 WASH - ME may constitute an important entry route for pathogens . Accordingly , 478 viruses such as IAV and LCMV exploit pathways with endocytic vacuole morphology 479 and mechanistic requirements similar yet not identical to HPV16 endocytosis 480 ( Sieczkarski and Whittaker , 2002 ; Quirin et al . , 2008 ; Rojek , Perez and Kunz , 2008 ; 481 de Vries et al . , 2011 ) . 482 483 The identification of SNX2 and WASH marks the beginning of a deeper 484 understanding of the mechanism underlying WASH - ME . Future research will aim to 485 reveal its cellular function , to identify additional components and the functional 486 interplay of the machinery in this uncharacterized new endocytic pathway to better 487 understand the mechanism of WASH - ME . 488 489 490 491 21 492 Limitations of the study 493 This work describes a novel function of the NPF WASH in regulating actin 494 polymerization for vesicle scission , thereby defining a molecular identity of a unique 495 endocytic pathway exploited by HPV16 for infection . Based on the fact that HPV16 496 uptake through WASH - ME occurs highly asynchronously over many hours , only very 497 few endocytic events are observable per cell at any given time post infection . Thus , 498 identification of endocytic structures proves to be challenging . For example , 499 colocalization analysis with marker proteins leads to statistically inconclusive results . 500 While dynamic association of cellular proteins with HPV16 during uptake delineated 501 by TIRF - M as well as identification of endocytic pits by EM together with immunogold 502 labelling of cellular proteins demonstrated WASH and SNX2 localization and 503 recruitment to endocytic pits events , the sample size of these experiments is limited if 504 compared to typical colocalization experiments . 505 22 Acknowledgements 506 We thank I .

U2OS wild type and WASH KO cells ( female origin ) as 746 well as murine NIH 3T3 wild type and WASH KO cells ( male origin ) were cultured in 747 DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % non - essential amino acids ( NEAA ) . 748 Primate , non - human BSC - 40 cells ( sex unspecified ) were grown in DMEM 749 supplemented with 10 % FBS , 5 % NEAA and 5 % sodium pyruvate . Hamster BHK - 21 750 cells ( male origin ) were cultured in Glasgow’s minimum essential medium ( GMEM ) 751 supplemented with 10 % FBS . All cells were cultivated in a humidified atmosphere at 752 37°C and 5 % CO 2 and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination . 753 754 755 36 Bacteria strains 756 Chemocompetent E . coli DH5a used for plasmid preparation were grown in lysogeny 757 broth ( LB ) medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37°C and 210 rpm . 758 759 Virus strains 760 VV - GFP ( Western Reserve ) containing a fluorescent version of the core protein A5 761 was propagated and titrated on BSC - 40 cells in standard growth medium and purified 762 as described previously ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 ) . HSV - 1 - EGFP ( 17syn + ) 763 expressing EGFP under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was propagated on 764 BHK - 21 cells and titrated on Vero cells , both grown in GMEM supplemented with 2 % 765 FBS , as described previously ( Schelhaas et al . , 2003 ; Hafezi et al . , 2012 ) . SFV 766 ( prototype strain ) was propagated and titrated on BHK - 21 - Helsinki cells as previously 767 described ( Marsh , Kielian and Helenius , 1984 ) . Infection was carried out in GMEM 768 supplemented with 10 % FBS and 10 % Tryptose Broth . VSV - GFP ( Indiana ) 769 expressing an additional transgene encoding GFP was propagated on BHK - 21 - 770 Helsinki cells grown in GMEM supplemented with 10 mM HEPES ( pH 6 . 5 ) . At 1 h 771 p . i . , GMEM supplemented with 30 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) and 10 % Tryptose 772 Phosphate Broth and 1 % FBS was added , as previously described ( Johannsdottir et 773 al . , 2009 ) . The virus was titrated on BHK - 21 - Helsinki cells grown in RPMI 774 supplemented with 30 mM HEPES ( pH 6 . 5 ) . HPV16 PsVs were produced as 775 described in the method details . 776 777 METHOD DETAILS 778 Cloning and plasmid purification 779 Cloning of HA - CD151 construct 780 37 Lentiviral expression constructs of HA - tagged CD151 were a kind gift from M . Hemler 781 ( Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School , Boston , USA ) ( Hwang , 782 Takimoto and Hemler , 2019 ) . For subcloning , HA - CD151 was cut from the lentiviral 783 vector using EcoR I and Xba I for 2 h at 37°C . A pcDNA3 expression vector was cut 784 using the same enzymes and conditions . For purification , both samples were run on 785 a 2 % acrylamide gel . The DNA was visualized with ethidium bromide and bands 786 representing the cut pcDNA3 backbone as well as HA - CD151 ( insert ) were isolated 787 from the gel . Gel extraction was performed with a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean - up 788 kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) . DNA concentrations were determined with help of a 1 . 5 % 789 agarose gel by comparison to the marker bands ( Gene Ruler 1 kb DNA ladder , 790 Thermo Scientific ) . Insert and backbone were ligated by incubation with the T4 ligase 791 overnight at 16°C . 792 793 Plasmid purification 794 Chemocompetent E . coli DH5a were incubated with 5 µl ligation product for 10 min 795 on ice . Heat shock was performed by 60 - 90 sec incubation at 42°C . Immediately 796 afterwards , bacteria were incubated on ice for 5 min before LB medium was added . 797 Bacteria were grown at 37°C and 350 rpm for 30 - 60 min and plated on LB agar 798 plates with antibiotics using inoculation loops . Plates were incubated overnight at 799 37°C and inspected for colony growth the next day . For HA - CD151 cloning , several 800 overnight cultures with LB supplemented with antibiotics were inoculated with one 801 colony each . Plasmids were purified using the NucleoSpin Plasmid kit ( Macherey - 802 Nagel ) and sent for sequencing by Eurofins Genomics ( Luxembourg ) . Sequence 803 analysis was performed with ApE . For use in experiments , plasmids were purified 804 using the NucleoBond Xtra Maxi kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) . 805 806 38 807 808 sgRNA design and cloning 809 sgRNAs were provided by a CRISPR design tool ( CRIPR . mit . edu or CCTop ) . 810 Specifically , the murine gene was disrupted by sgRNAs targeting exon 2 and the 811 human gene by simultaneously targeting exons 4 and 5 ( key resources table ) . Top 812 and bottom strands of sgRNAs were annealed using T4 ligase for 30 min at 37°C and 813 cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( pX458 ) by digestion with Bbs I and ligation with 814 T4 ligase ( 6 cycles : 37°C for 5 min , 21°C for 5 min ) . Residual linearized DNA was 815 removed by treatment with PlasmidSafe exonuclease at 37°C for 30 min . Chemically 816 competent E . coli DH5a were transformed with the ligation product as described 817 above . 818 819 Generation and characterization of WASH KO cell lines with CRISPR / Cas9 820 NIH - 3T3 and U2OS cells were plated in 6 - well plates and maintained in DMEM 821 ( 4 . 5 g / L glucose , Invitrogen , Germany ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ( Sigma , 822 Germany ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 1x non - essential amino acids and 2 mM L - 823 glutamine at 37°C in a humidified 7 . 5 % CO2 - atmosphere overnight . Cells were 824 genome edited using the CRISPR / Cas9 technology ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) to generate 825 WASH KO cell lines . Selected sgRNAs ( key resources table ) were cloned into pX458 826 allowing simultaneous expression of sgRNA , Cas9 and selection via EGFP 827 expression as described above . The resulting constructs were transfected into NIH - 828 3T3 or U2OS cells , respectively . Plasmids ( 1 µg ) and X - tremeGene TM 9 ( 3 µl ) were 829 diluted in 100 µl optiMEM , incubated for 30 min at room temperature and added to 830 cells for 16 - 24 h . Transfection efficiency was monitored using an EVOS® FL Cell 831 Imaging System ( Thermo Fisher , Germany ) . Cells were grown to confluence and 832 39 subsequently single , GFP - positive cells were sorted into 96 - well plates by flow 833 cytometry using a FACSAria II instrument ( BD Biosciences ) and FACSDiva software . 834 Sorted cells were maintained in growth medium supplemented with penicillin ( 50 835 Units / ml ) / streptomycin ( 50 mg / ml ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and containing 30 % 836 conditioned medium and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor ( BD Biosciences ) . After 837 approximately 10 days , clones were picked from single wells and expanded . Derived 838 cell clones were screened for the absence of WASH expression by Western blotting 839 and NIH - 3T3 clones lacking detectable amounts of WASH were subjected to 840 genomic sequencing as described ( Kage et al . , 2017 ) . Cells from confluent 6 cm 841 dishes were trypsinized , pelleted and lysed by overnight incubation in lysis buffer 842 ( 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 5 , 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % SDS , 200 mM NaCl , 20 mg / ml proteinase 843 K ) at 55°C . Nucleic acid extraction was performed by ethanol precipitation . Addition 844 of 700 µl 100 % ice cold ethanol was followed by centrifugation at 16 , 000 x g at 4°C 845 for 30 min . The pellet was washed with 400 µl 70 % ice - cold ethanol and samples 846 were dried at 45°C for 20 min . DNA was dissolved in 100 µl deionized water at 4°C 847 overnight and served as template in PCR using GoTaq G2 flexi DNA polymerase . 848 The selected primer pair ( key resources table ) revealed a PCR product of 330 base 849 pairs . PCR products were examined on 2 % agarose gels and appropriate samples 850 purified with a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean - up kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) . DNA 851 fragments were cloned into a zero blunt TOPO vector ( Zero Blunt TOPO Cloning Kit 852 for Sequencing , Invitrogen ) for 5 min at room temperature . After transformation as 853 above , single bacterial colonies were inoculated overnight and plasmid DNA purified 854 using NucleoSpin Plasmid kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) . Sequencing of isolated plasmid 855 DNA was carried out by MWG - Biotech using a standard M13r sequencing primer 856 ( key resources table ) . Clones were examined for frameshift mutations and mono - or 857 biallelic deletions / insertions using SnapGene Viewer software . Mutations or deletions 858 40 generating stop codons shortly downstream of the target site were defined as ‘null’ 859 alleles . Cell populations exclusively harboring such alleles out of more than 50 860 sequencing reactions were selected for further analyses . For WASH targeted clones 861 of murine NIH - 3T3 cells , three clones were identified that did not display a wild type 862 allele in more than ten sequencing reactions . All clones showed similar effects on 863 HPV16 infection , thus only one clone is shown in this study . For WASH targeted 864 clones of human U2OS cells no clear sequencing result was obtained probably due 865 to pseudogenes being targeted by sequencing primers . 866 867 Western blotting 868 For analysis of protein amounts after siRNA treatment or CRISPR / Cas9 mediated 869 KO , lysates were prepared in 2x sample buffer ( 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % 870 bromophenol blue , 100 mM Tris HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 200 mM DTT ) . Samples were 871 denatured for 5 min at 95°C and loaded on polyacrylamide gels . For stacking gels , 872 5 % polyacrylamide was used and separating cells were 6 or 8 % for JMY and 873 WHAMM , respectively . All other proteins were separated on 10 % gels . 874 Electrophoresis was performed in Laemmli running buffer ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 25 mM Tris , 875 192 mM glycine ) . Proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes for 876 50 min at 400 mA in pre - cooled transfer buffer ( 192 mM glycine , 25 mM Tris , 10 % 877 methanol ) . After transfer , membranes were blocked in 5 % milk powder ( MP ) in Tris - 878 buffered saline ( TBS ) supplemented with 0 . 2 % Tween 20 ( TBS - TMP ) or in 0 . 2 - 3 % 879 bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for at least 30 min . Primary antibodies were diluted in 880 TBS - TMP or BSA and membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature or 881 overnight at 4°C . Three washes with TBS supplemented with Tween 20 ( TBS - T ) 882 were followed by incubation with anti - mouse or - rabbit secondary antibodies 883 conjugated to HRP diluted in TBS - TMP or BSA . Membranes were washed twice with 884 41 TBS - T and once with TBS before the signal from HRP - conjugated antibodies was 885 revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) or ECL prime and photographic 886 films . 887 888 889 Virus production 890 Production of HPV16 PsVs 891 PsV production was performed as previously described ( Buck et al . , 2005 ) . A total of 892 1 . 8 x 10 7 293TT cells were seeded in 145 mm cell culture dishes . The next day , cells 893 were co - transfected with p16sheLL and the reporter plasmid pClneoEGFP ( GFP ) or 894 pRwB ( RFP ) . Both plasmids ( 30 µg each ) as well as Lipofectamine 2000 ( 132 . 5 µl ) 895 were diluted in optiMEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature . The DNA 896 dilution was added to the Lipofectamine 2000 dilution and samples were incubated 897 for 20 min at room temperature before the transfection mix was added to fresh 898 growth medium in the dishes . At 48 h post transfection , cells were harvested and 899 pelleted . For cell lysis and virus maturation , the pellet was incubated with 0 . 35 % Brij 900 58 , 0 . 2 % Plasmid Safe DNase and 0 . 2 % benzonase for 24 h at 37°C on an overhead 901 rotator . PsVs were purified using a linear 25 % - 39 % OptiPrep density gradient . A PsV 902 fraction at around 30 % OptiPrep was collected with a needle and analyzed for virus 903 content and purity by Coomassie staining of SDS - PAGE gels . 904 905 Labeling of HPV16 PsVs 906 HPV16 PsVs were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 , 568 , 594 or 647 succinimidyl 907 ester in virion buffer ( 635 mM NaCl , 0 . 9 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 1 mM KCl in 908 PBS , pH 7 . 6 ) using a 1 : 8 molar ratio of L1 to the dye for 1 h on an overhead rotator 909 ( Schelhaas et al . , 2008 ; Ventayol and Schelhaas , 2015 ) . Free dye was removed by 910 42 ultracentrifugation using a 15 - 25 - 39 % OptiPrep step gradient . The labeled virus 911 between the 25 % and 39 % OptiPrep fraction was collected with a needle . The PsV 912 concentration was determined by SDS - PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining . 913 The labeled virus was characterized by binding to glass coverslips and HeLa ATCC 914 cells ( Ventayol and Schelhaas , 2015 ) . Labeling of PsVs with pHrodo was achieved 915 following the same protocol . Virus characterization was performed in citric acid buffer 916 ( pH 4 . 4 ) ( Ventayol and Schelhaas , 2015 ) . 917 918 Infection experiments 919 Infection of KO cells 920 NIH - 3T3 ( 4 x 10 5 cells / well ) and U2OS ( both 5 x 10 4 cells / well ) wild type and WASH 921 KO cells were seeded in 12 - well plates . The next day , the growth medium was 922 replaced with 300 µl fresh growth medium and HPV16 - GFP was added to result in 923 20 % infection in wild type cells . The virus was bound on a shaker at 37°C . At 2 h p . i . , 924 the inoculum was replaced by fresh growth medium and infection was continued . At 925 48 h p . i . , cells were trypsinized and fixed in 4 % PFA for 15 min at room temperature . 926 Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer ( 250 mM EDTA , 2 % FBS , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 in 927 PBS ) and analyzed for infection ( percentage of GFP positive cells ) by flow cytometry 928 ( FACSCalibur , Becton Dickinson ) . Gating of infected cells was done with help of 929 uninfected controls . The percentage of infected cells was normalized to the 930 respective wild type cells using Microsoft Excel . 931 932 Inhibitor studies 933 HeLa ATCC cells were seeded in 12 - well plates ( 5 x 10 4 cells / well ) about 16 h prior 934 to experimentation . Retro - 2 experiments were done with HeLa Kyoto cells ( 1 x 10 5 935 cells / well ) . For HPV16 and HSV - 1 infection experiments , small compound inhibitors 936 43 and solvent controls were diluted in growth medium , while they were diluted in 937 infection medium ( RPMI supplemented with 30 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 5 ) for VSV 938 infection . Cells were pre - treated with inhibitors or solvent controls for 30 min at 939 indicated concentrations and infected with HPV16 - GFP as described above . The 940 inoculum was replaced at 2 h p . i . and infection was continued in presence of the 941 inhibitor . At 12 h p . i . , inhibitors were exchanged for 10 mM NH 4 Cl / 10 mM HEPES in 942 growth medium to reduce cytotoxicity ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . Cells were fixed and 943 processed for flow cytometry analysis as described above . For infection with VSV - 944 GFP , the virus was added to the infection medium + / - inhibitor to result in 20 % 945 infection in solvent treated controls . VSV - GFP was bound for 2 h on a shaker at 37°C 946 until the inoculum was replaced with 1 ml growth medium . Cells were trypsinized and 947 fixed at 6 h p . i . as described for HPV16 . HSV - 1 infection was carried out in growth 948 medium containing the inhibitor or the solvent control . The virus was bound at 4°C for 949 1 h , the medium was exchanged for fresh , warm medium with inhibitors and infection 950 was continued for 5 h at 37°C . Cells were fixed at 6 h p . i . as described before . 951 952 To investigate additional effects of retro - 2 treatment on HPV16 trafficking , the virus 953 was accumulated in the endolysosomal system by treatment with 10 mM NH 4 Cl for 954 the first 12 h of infection ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . Then , the inhibitors were replaced 955 by 50 / 100 µM retro - 2 and cells were fixed at 48 h p . i . as described above . All 956 samples were analyzed for infection ( percentage of GFP positive cells ) by flow 957 cytometry ( FACSCalibur , Becton Dickinson ) . Gating of infected cells was done with 958 help of solvent treated controls to which the percentage of infected cells was 959 normalized . 960 961 Infection studies after siRNA - mediated depletion 962 44 For siRNA - mediated knockdown , 2 x 10 3 or 2 x 10 4 HeLa Kyoto cells were reverse 963 transfected in 96 - well optical bottom plates or 12 - well plates , respectively . 964 Transfection was performed using 0 . 2 µl ( 96 - well ) or 0 . 5 µl ( 12 - well ) Lipofectamine 965 RNAi max per well diluted in optiMEM and siRNAs were diluted in optiMEM to reach 966 the working concentration indicated in supplemental table 1 . The following procedure 967 and incubation times were as for Lipofectamine 2000 . Besides the siRNA against the 968 cellular proteins of interest , the AllStars negative siRNA ( ctrl . ) was included as a non - 969 targeting control , whereas the AllStars death siRNA was used to test for successful 970 transfection . Moreover , an siRNA targeting GFP was included to suppress the 971 expression of the HPV16 - GFP reporter plasmid as a measure for maximal reduction 972 of infection . For RNAi against WASH , cells were transfected twice in 48 h intervals . 973 Cells were infected with HPV16 - GFP at 48 h post transfection to result in 20 % 974 infection in ctrl . negative transfected controls . In 12 - well plates , infection was 975 performed and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above . Absolute infection 976 values were normalized to ctrl . transfected controls . In 96 - well plates , the virus was 977 added without prior medium exchange to reduce cell loss . At 48 h p . i . , cells were 978 fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS and nuclei were stained with RedDot2 for 30 min after 979 permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton in PBS . Infection was analyzed by automated 980 microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert Z . 1 microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU22 981 spinning disk module ( Visitron Systems ) . Images were acquired using a 20x 982 objective , a CoolSnap HQ camera ( Photometrics ) and MetaMorph Software . Cell 983 number and infection were determined using a MATLAB - based infection scoring 984 procedure ( Engel et al . , 2011 ) . The program detects nuclei and infection signal 985 individually , based on their limiting intensity edges . The edges were filled to objects , 986 which were classified by size . Binary masks of nuclei and infection signal were 987 created and cells were classified as infected if equal or greater than 5 % of their 988 45 nuclei overlapped with infection signal above a certain threshold . In this study , signal 989 twice above the background in the uninfected sample was considered infected . An 990 infection index was obtained for each image and averaged per well ( Snijder et al . , 991 2012 ) . 992 993 Infection with VV - GFP was carried out in 96 - well plates following the same protocol 994 as for HPV16 with the exception that 3 x 10 3 cells were transfected . Virus amounts 995 leading to 20 % infection in ctrl . treated controls were used . Cells were fixed at 6 h p . i . 996 and analyzed by automated microscopy , as described above . 997 998 For siRNA experiments with SFV , 5 x 10 4 HeLa Kyoto cells were reverse transfected 999 in 12 - well plates . Infection was performed by addition of the virus to infection medium 1000 ( RPMI supplemented with 10 % FBS , 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) ) . The virus was bound 1001 on a shaker at 37°C . At 2 h p . i . , the inoculum was replaced by growth medium . Cells 1002 were trypsinized and fixed at 6 h p . i . . Since SFV did not carry a fluorescent reporter 1003 plasmid , samples were immunostained for SFV E1 / E2 after fixation at 6 h p . i . . Cells 1004 were permeabilized with FACS perm ( 250 mM EDTA , 2 % FBS , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 , 0 . 05 % 1005 Saponin in PBS ) for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated with 1006 the Lady Di antiserum ( Singh and Helenius , 1992 ) diluted in FACS perm for 2 h at 1007 room temperature . Samples were washed thrice with FACS perm and incubated with 1008 an anti - rabbit AF488 secondary antibody in FACS perm for 1 h at room temperature . 1009 Washing with FACS perm was followed by infection scoring with FACS analysis 1010 ( FACSCalibur , Becton Dickinson ) as described for HPV16 . Infection values were 1011 normalized to crtl . using Microsoft Excel . 1012 1013 Infection studies in transiently transfected cells 1014 46 NIH - 3T3 wild type and WASH KO cells were seeded in 12 - well plates 1015 ( 4 x 10 4 cells / well ) . One day later , cells were transfected with plasmids ( 1 µg ) 1016 encoding EGFP - WASH or EGFP , YFP - WASH or YFP - WASH dWCA using 1017 Lipofectamine 2000 ( 0 . 5 µl / well ) diluted in optiMEM . Incubation times were the same 1018 as for virus preparation . At about 16 h post transfection , cells were infected with 1019 HPV16 - RFP as described above to result in 20 % infection in control cells transfected 1020 with GFP . Cells were trypsinized at 48 h p . i . , fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS and analyzed 1021 by flow cytometry ( Guava easyCyte , Merck ) . Final analysis was performed with 1022 FlowJo . Transfected cells were gated with help of untransfected controls . Then , the 1023 GFP positive population was gated for infection using transfected , but uninfected 1024 controls . The percentage of transfected and infected cells ( GFP and RFP positive ) 1025 was normalized to NIH - 3T3 wild type cells transfected with the GFP control to obtain 1026 relative infection values using Microsoft Excel . 1027 1028 HeLa ATCC cells were transfected with Scar - W and - WA constructs as described 1029 above 16 - 24 h prior to infection . Cells were infected with HPV16 - RFP and fixed 48 h 1030 p . i . using 4 % PFA . Infection was scored using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope 1031 equipped with an electron multiplier CCD camera ( EDMCCD , C9100 - 02 , Hamamatsu 1032 Photonics K . K . ) and a monochromator for epifluorescence excitation . Images were 1033 thresholded manually and at least 100 cells were scored for transfection and infection 1034 using Fiji . 1035 1036 HPV16 binding assay 1037 For analysis of HPV16 binding by flow cytometry , 5 x 10 4 NIH - 3T3 wild type and 1038 WASH KO cells were seeded per well of a 12 - well plate . The next day , fluorescently 1039 labeled HPV16 - AF488 ( ~ 1000 particles / cell ) was bound to the cells for 2 h on a 1040 47 shaker at 37°C . Cells treated with siRNAs were reseeded at 48 h post transfection ( 5 1041 x 10 4 cells / well ) . Virus binding was performed once cells were attached , typically 1042 about 6 h post seeding . As a non - binding control , HPV16 - AF488 was pre - incubated 1043 with 1 mg / ml heparin for 1 h at room temperature prior to binding to cells ( Cerqueira 1044 et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were trypsinized and fixed with 4 % PFA . Virus binding was 1045 analyzed by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity ( geometric mean ) of cells in 1046 flow cytometry ( FACSCalibur ) . The geometric mean of uninfected cells was 1047 subtracted from infected cells and virus binding was normalized to control cells . A 1048 similar procedure was applied to measure virus binding to HeLa Kyoto cells depleted 1049 of SNX2 . Binding was qualitatively assessed for NIH - 3T3 wild type and WASH KO 1050 cells as well as after SNX2 KD in HeLa Kyoto cells . For this , HPV16 - AF568 was 1051 bound to these cells as described above . At 2 h p . i . , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA 1052 and stained with 0 . 1 µg / ml phalloidin - Atto488 diluted in PHEM buffer ( 60 mM PIPES , 1053 10 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 9 ) supplemented with 0 . 01 % Triton 1054 X - 100 for 30 min . Cells were washed thrice with PBS and mounted on glass slides 1055 using AF1 mounting medium . Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert Z . 1 1056 microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU22 spinning disk module ( Visitron 1057 Systems ) using a 40x objective , a CoolSnap HQ camera ( Photometrics ) and 1058 MetaMorph Software . Z - stacks covering the cell volume were converted to maximum 1059 intensity projections using Fiji . Brightness and contrast were adjusted using 1060 uninfected samples . 1061 1062 For microscopy - based analysis of retro - 2 treated cells , HeLa Kyoto cells were 1063 seeded to confluency in a 96 - well plate . At least 6 h post seeding , HPV16 - AF594 or - 1064 AF488 ( ~ 1000 particles / cell ) were bound to cells in presence or absence of the 1065 inhibitor , as above . At 2 h p . i . , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA and binding was 1066 48 analyzed using a 40x objective of a spinning disk confocal microscope described 1067 above . Z - stacks covering the cell volume were converted to sum intensity z - 1068 projections using Fiji . The mean fluorescence intensities of HPV16 AF were 1069 measured as arbitrary units per field of view . Background intensities measured in 1070 uninfected samples were subtracted from raw intensities , which were normalized to 1071 solvent treated control cells . 1072 1073 1074 1075 Infectious internalization assay 1076 One day prior to infection , 5 x 10 4 HeLa Kyoto cells were seeded per well of a 12 - well 1077 plate . Cells were pre - incubated with inhibitors and infected with HPV16 - GFP as 1078 described above . At 12 h p . i . , extracellular virus was inactivated by washing with 1 ml 1079 0 . 1 mM CAPS buffer ( pH 10 . 5 ) for 90 sec ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ; Becker et al . , 1080 2018 ) . The cells were washed twice with PBS to remove CAPS and infection was 1081 continued in fresh growth medium . To control for inhibitor reversibility , the inhibitor 1082 was washed out thrice with PBS without prior CAPS treatment and fresh growth 1083 medium was added . At 48 h p . i . , cells were fixed and infection was scored by flow 1084 cytometry as described above . Infection results were normalized to inhibitor 1085 reversibility . 1086 1087 Endocytosis assay with HPV16 - pHrodo 1088 Cells were reverse transfected with siRNAs as described above . At 48 h after the first 1089 ( Arp3 , SNX2 ) or second ( WASH ) siRNA transfection , HPV16 - pHrodo ( ~ 1000 1090 particles / cell ) was added to 350 µl growth medium and bound for 2 h on a shaker . 1091 The inoculum was replaced at 2 h p . i . and cells were imaged live at 6 h p . i . at 37°C 1092 49 and 5 % CO 2 in humidified atmosphere using custom made imaging chambers and 1093 DMEM high glucose without phenol red supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 % L - 1094 glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 1095 Z . 1 microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU22 spinning disk module ( Visitron 1096 Systems ) using a 40x objective , a CoolSnap HQ camera ( Photometrics ) and 1097 MetaMorph Software . Average intensity projections of confocal slices were generated 1098 using Fiji software . Intensity based analysis was performed with CellProfiler ( Becker 1099 et al . , 2018 ) . In brief , the virus signal was enhanced by application of a white top - hat 1100 filter . Virus spots were segmented by application of a gaussian filter and maximum 1101 correlation thresholding . Virus intensity was then measured in enhanced and original 1102 images . Pivot tables ( Microsoft Excel ) were used to summarize the intensity of spots 1103 per condition . These values were normalized to the cell number , which was 1104 determined by manual counting from brightfield images . The virus intensity per cell 1105 was then normalized to ctrl . treated controls to obtain relative internalization values . 1106 Cell outlines were created manually for presentation purposes . 1107 1108 Electron microscopy and CLEM 1109 CLEM 1110 A circular mark used for localization of unroofed cells was generated in the center of 1111 coverslips ( 22 mm diameter ) using a diamond knife . For ECM production , 2 x 10 6 1112 HaCaT cells were seeded onto the coverslips placed in a 6 - well plate . At 48 h post 1113 seeding , ECM was obtained by detaching cells through incubation with 10 mM 1114 EDTA / EGTA for 45 min at 37°C , subsequent clapping of the plate and washes with 1115 PBS ( Culp et al . , 2006 ) . HPV16 - AF568 was bound to the ECM in 1 ml growth 1116 medium / well for 2 h on a shaker at 37°C . HaCaT cells were trypsinized and 12 x 10 5 1117 cells / well were seeded onto the virus bound to ECM . At 1 h post seeding , 10 µg / ml 1118 50 cytoD or DMSO ( solvent control ) were added . A total of 6 h post seeding , cells were 1119 put on ice and washed thrice with cold stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30 mM 1120 HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 with KOH ) , 5 mM MgCl 2 ) . For unroofing , the cells were kept on ice 1121 and 1 ml cold 2 % PFA in stabilization buffer was aspirated with a 1 ml pipette . The 1122 pipette was positioned above the marked area in the center of the coverslip and PFA 1123 was harshly released onto the cells . The coverslip was then rapidly transferred to a 1124 new well containing cold 2 % PFA in stabilization buffer to avoid sedimentation of cell 1125 debris on the unroofed membrane . Membrane sheets were fixed for 10 min at 4°C . 1126 Samples were mounted in custom - made imaging chambers and imaged in PBS at a 1127 Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope equipped with a PerkinElmer UltraVIEW VoX spinning 1128 disk module . Images were acquired using a 60x objective , an Orca Flash 4 camera 1129 ( Hamamatsu ) and Volocity software ( PerkinElmer , version 6 . 3 ) . Montages of 10 x 10 1130 images and 10 % overlap were acquired around the center of the marked area . The 1131 unroofed membranes were prepared for EM by fixation with 2 % glutaraldehyde ( GA ) 1132 in PBS overnight at 4°C . After two washes with water , samples were incubated with 1133 0 . 1 % tannic acid for 20 min at room temperature and subsequently washed with 1134 water . Contrasting was performed with 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate ( UAC ) for 20 min at room 1135 temperature . After three washes with water , samples were dehydrated with a series 1136 of ethanol solutions ( 15 % / 30 % / 50 % / 70 % / 80 % / 90 % / 100 % ) . Coverslips were 1137 incubated with each solution for 5 min , incubation with 100 % ethanol was repeated 1138 thrice . Samples were dried using hexamethyldisilazane ( HDMS ) . After 5 min 1139 incubation at room temperature , fresh HDMS was added and samples were 1140 incubated for further 30 min at room temperature . Coverslips were dried and coated 1141 under vacuum using a Balzers BAF301 device ( former Balzers AG , Liechtenstein ) . A 1142 first layer of platinum was applied at an angle of 11°C while rotating . A second layer 1143 of carbon was applied at an angle of 90° while rotating . Coverslips were cut to fit on 1144 51 EM grids before 5 % hydrofluoric acid were used to separate the metal replica from 1145 the glass . Replicas were extensively washed with water prior to transfer to glow 1146 discharged , formvar coated EM grids . Replicas were imaged with a phase contrast 1147 microscope for orientation . Intact membranes associated with virus particles were 1148 manually selected based on overlays of images from fluorescence and phase 1149 contrast microscopy and imaged at a TEM ( Jeol JEM - 1400 , Jeol Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan , 1150 camera : TemCam F416 ; TVIPS , Gauting , Germany ) . Membrane sheets were imaged 1151 using montages of 5 x 5 images and 15 % overlap . Fluorescence and EM images 1152 were initially overlaid manually using Photoshop , then the Fiji plugin Landmark 1153 Correspondences ( Saalfeld and Tomancák , 2008 ) was used for transformation of the 1154 fluorescence image according to the EM image using three manually identified 1155 landmarks . For analysis , HPV16 was identified manually based on the fluorescent 1156 signal and classification was done by visual evaluation of associated structures in 1157 TEM images . At total of 134 and 101 membrane associated virus particles in DMSO 1158 ( 7 membranes ) and cytoD ( 5 membranes ) treated cells were analyzed , respectively . 1159 1160 Ultra - thin section EM 1161 Samples for ultra - thin section EM were prepared and analyzed as described 1162 previously ( Bannach et al . , 2020 ) . A total of 1 - 2 x 10 5 NIH 3T3 wild type , WASH KO 1163 and HeLa Kyoto cells or were seeded in 3 cm dishes . Two days post seeding , cells 1164 were either pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min or were left untreated . Cells were 1165 infected with 40 µg HPV16 PsVs in 1 ml growth medium . At 6 h p . i . , cells were fixed 1166 in 2 . 5 % GA in PBS ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 10 min at room temperature . A second fixation was 1167 performed with cold 2 . 5 % GA at 4°C overnight . Cells were washed thrice with PBS , 1168 post - fixed with 1 % OsO 4 in ddH 2 O for 1 h and washed twice with ddH 2 O at room 1169 temperature and at 4°C for 20 min , respectively . Block contrasting was performed 1170 52 with 0 . 5 % UAC in ddH 2 O at 4°C overnight . Cells were washed thrice with ddH 2 O and 1171 dehydrated using ascending graded alcohol series . Detaching and dehydrating with 1172 propylene oxide were followed by incubation with propylene oxide and epoxy resin 1173 ( 1 : 3 , 1 : 1 , 3 : 1 ) for 2 h each , before cells were incubated with pure epoxy resin for 3 h 1174 and embedded in BEEM capsules . The resin was allowed to polymerize at 60°C for 1175 three days before 60 nm ultra - thin sections were cut and counterstained with uranyl 1176 acetate and lead . Samples were imaged at a 80 kV on a Tecnai 12 electron 1177 microscope ( FEI ) using an Olympus Veleta 4k CCD camera or Ditabis imaging 1178 plates . Images were contrast enhanced and cropped using Adobe Photoshop CS4 . 1179 The total number of endocytic pits per cell was determined for 31 and 43 cells in wild 1180 type and WASH KO cells , respectively , in two independent experiments . Only 1181 endocytic pits containing virus ( es ) were counted , since HPV16 pits are hardly 1182 distinguishable from uncoated pits from other endocytic pathways without further 1183 staining . Pit numbers were normalized to wild type cells . 1184 1185 Immunogold labeling 1186 HeLa ATCC cells ( 2 - 3 x 10 5 cells ) were seeded in 6 cm dishes . The next day , cells 1187 were transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFP - WASH or EGFP - SNX2 ( 7 µg ) using 1188 Lipofectamine 2000 ( 3 . 5 µl ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions or left 1189 untransfected . At 48 h post transfection , cells were infected with 80 µg HPV16 PsVs 1190 and incubated for 6 h at 37°C until pre - fixation by addition of 4 % formaldehyde in 1191 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) to the culture medium ( 1 : 1 ratio ) for 5 min . Then , 1192 cells were fixed in 2 % formaldehyde , and 0 . 2 % GA in 0 . 1M phosphate buffer 1193 ( pH 7 . 2 ) . Samples were processed for TEM as previously described ( Humbel and 1194 Stierhof , 2009 ) . In brief , cells were quenched by incubation in 0 . 1 % glycine in 0 . 1 M 1195 PB ( 2 x 30 min ) , washed thrice in 0 . 1 M PB for 30 min and scraped with 1 % gelatin . 1196 53 After centrifugation , the gelatin was replaced with 12 % gelatin and cells were infused 1197 at 37°C . Cells were cooled down on ice and the gelatin - cell pellet was cut into small 1198 blocks that were infused with 2 . 3 M sucrose overnight at 4°C . The blocks were 1199 mounted on specimen carriers and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Ultra - thin cryosections 1200 were prepared according to Tokuyasu ( Tokuyasu , 1980 ) . In brief , ultra - thin 1201 cryosections of 50 nm thickness were prepared with an EM UC6 / FC6 ultramicrotome 1202 ( Leica Microsystems ) . Sections were collected in a sucrose - methylcellulose mixture 1203 and stored on TEM grids at 4°C until further processing . Methylcellulose was melted 1204 and sections were washed five times with 20 mM glycine in PBS . Quenching was 1205 followed by blocking with 1 % BSA for 3 min . Cells were then incubated with a GFP - 1206 antibody for 30 min , washed 6 times with 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS and incubated with 1207 protein A gold 15 nm for 20 min . Sections were rinsed 10 times with PBS and re - fixed 1208 in 1 % GA in PBS ( pH 7 . 2 ) . For double labeling , the sections were quenched , blocked 1209 and immunostained with an actin antibody as described above . Then sections were 1210 incubated with a rabbit anti - mouse bridging antibody followed by 6 washes with 0 . 1 % 1211 BSA in PBS and incubated with protein A gold 10 nm ( 1 : 50 ) . Sections were rinsed 1212 10 times with PBS and re - fixed in 1 % GA in PBS , pH 7 . 2 . Sections were rinsed 10 1213 times with ddH 2 O and contrasted with uranyl acetate for 6 min ( pH 7 ) . After one wash 1214 with ddH 2 O , cells were embedded in an uranyl acetate - methylcellulose mixture ( pH 1215 4 ) for 10 min . After looping out with filter paper , sections were dried and images were 1216 acquired as above . 1217 1218 Fluorescence microscopy 1219 CLC and virus internalization analysis by live cell TIRF microscopy 1220 HeLa ATCC cells were seeded on coverslips in 12 - well plates ( 5 x 10 4 cells / well ) one 1221 day prior to transfection . Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding lifeact - EGFP , 1222 54 EGFP - WASH , EGFP - SNX2 , mRFP - CLC or EGFP - Dyn2 as described above . For 1223 internalization analysis , fluorescently labeled virus ( HPV16 - AF594 / AF647 ) was 1224 bound at 37°C at about 18 h post transfection . At 1 h p . i . , coverslips were mounted in 1225 custom - made imaging chambers . Cells were imaged at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in 1226 humidified atmosphere in DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1227 1 % L - glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Time lapse movies of cells 1228 expressing lifeact - EGFP were acquired with a 60x TIRF - objective on an Olympus 1229 IX70 microscope equipped with a TIRF condenser and an electron multiplier CCD 1230 camera ( EDMCCD , C9100 - 02 , Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) using MetaMorph 1231 software ( Molecular Devices ) ( Visitron Systems ) . All other time lapse movies were 1232 acquired using a 100x TIRF - objective at an Olympus IX83 microscope equipped with 1233 a four - line TIRF condenser and an EMCCD camera ( iXon Ultra 888 , Andor Oxford 1234 Instruments ) using CellSens Dimensions software ( Olympus ) . Movies were acquired 1235 with 0 . 5 Hz frame rate for 5 min . HPV16 entry events were identified manually and 1236 the intensity of fluorescent proteins at virus entry sites was analyzed after rolling ball 1237 background subtraction and filtering ( mean intensity filter ) with Fiji . Kymographs , 1238 intensity profiles along a manually drawn line through the virus / clathrin signal over 1239 time , were generated with Fiji after background subtraction and filtering . Intensity 1240 profiles measured with Fiji using a circular region of interest , were processed by 1241 min / max normalization and aligned by setting the half time of virus internalization to 0 1242 s . Profiles were plotted with Microsoft Excel . Moving averages of signals are shown 1243 as a trendline ( period 4 - 20 ) . The time points of recruitment onset , maximal signal or 1244 signal loss were manually determined relative to the half time of internalization and 1245 box plots were generated with GraphPad Prism . Cells co - transfected with CLC and 1246 Dyn2 were analyzed the same way at about 16 h post transfection . Movies were 1247 compressed to 20 fps and PNG . 1248 55 1249 Proximity ligation assay 1250 For ECM production on coverslips , 5 x 10 5 HaCaT cells were seeded per well of a 1251 12 - well plate and cultivated at 37°C for 2 days . Additionally , 7 x 10 4 HaCaT cells 1252 were seeded per well and transfected the next day with a plasmid encoding HA - 1253 CD151 . The procedure was the same as for infection studies with transfected cells , 1254 but 0 . 4 µg DNA and 1 µl Lipofectamine 2000 per well were used . ECM on coverslips 1255 was obtained by detaching cells with 0 . 5 ml 10 mM EDTA / EGTA as described above . 1256 HPV16 - AF488 ( ~ 1000 particles / cell ) was bound to the ECM in 400 µl growth medium 1257 on a shaker at 37°C . At 2 h post binding , HaCaT cells expressing HA - CD151 were 1258 trypsinized and transferred onto the virus bound to ECM . Cells were allowed to 1259 attach for 5 h and fixed in 2 % PFA in PBS for 10 min at 4°C . Cells were 1260 permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Brij 58 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature prior to 1261 blocking in 1 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Primary antibody 1262 staining against HA ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) and WASH ( 1 : 500 ) was carried out in a wet chamber 1263 overnight at 4°C . Next , cells were incubated with anti - mouse PLUS and anti - rabbit 1264 MINUS Duolink PLA probes diluted 1 : 5 in 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37°C in a 1265 humidity chamber . Duolink In Situ Detection Reagents Red were used for further 1266 sample processing . For ligation of PLA probes , 1 . 25 U ligase per sample were added 1267 to the corresponding ligation buffer diluted in ddH 2 O . The cells were incubated in at 1268 wet chamber for 30 min at 37°C followed by two washes with wash buffer B ( 2 min , 1269 room temperature ) . Amplification was performed with 6 . 25 U polymerase and Duolink 1270 Amplification Red ( 1 : 5 ) diluted in ddH 2 O in a wet chamber at 37°C for 100 min . Cells 1271 were washed twice for 10 min with wash buffer B at room temperature followed by a 1272 quick wash with 0 . 1x wash buffer B in ddH 2 O .
