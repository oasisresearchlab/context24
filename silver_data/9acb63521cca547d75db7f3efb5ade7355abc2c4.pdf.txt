This cellular skeleton ( called the cytoskeleton ) provides structure to cells , enables their movement within the environment and promotes the internalization of extracellular cargo ( endocytosis ) . Many pathogens have devised strategies to hijack the cytoskeleton and other crucial sub - cellular processes for their disease processes . The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes ( L . monocytogenes ) utilizes the clathrin endocytic machinery to invade cells , and later , the actin polymerization machinery to generate actin - rich comet / rocket tails to move within and amongst host cells . Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S . Typhimurium ) and Shigella flexneri ( S . flexneri ) generate actin - rich membrane ruffles at the cell surface to enter cells . Once inside , S . Typhimurium occupies a long - lived vacuole , whereas S . flexneri generates comet / rocket tails . Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) on the other hand remain extracellular and co - opt clathrin and actin to form motile pedestals directly beneath the site of bacterial adherence . In this thesis , I explored the involvement of several host actin - and / or endocytic - associated proteins during bacterial infections and simultaneously used these infections to gain insight into novel roles of the proteins studied . In chapter 2 , I discovered that L . monocytogenes co - opts the actin - associated protein palladin during its entry and intracellular motility . Importantly , I revealed that palladin can functionally replace the Arp2 / 3 complex during bacterial actin - based motility . In chapter 3 , I uncovered that the internalization strategy used by L . monocytogenes to transfer between host cells exploits caveolin - mediated endocytosis . In chapter 4 , I investigated the host enzyme cyclophilin A ( CypA ) and found that it is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions generated during bacterial dissemination events . In chapter 5 , I determined that CypA restricts S . Typhimurium invasion but is dispensable for EPEC pedestal formation . Finally , in chapters 6 and 7 , I examined the receptor of CypA , CD147 , and found that this membrane protein , like CypA , is crucial for the proper formation and function of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions . In conclusion , my research has 2 major implications : 1 ) I have uncovered new insight into the mechanisms behind how actin - hijacking pathogens cause disease and 2 ) I have demonstrated novel cellular functions for host actin - associated proteins . iv Keywords : Actin ; caveolin ; Listeria monocytogenes ; EPEC ; Shigella flexneri ; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium v Dedication I dedicate this work to my parents , sisters and grandparents who have given me such unwavering support as I complete this chapter of my life . Additionally , I truly could not have accomplished this study without the fierce mentorship , encouragement and support from my supervisors , colleagues and students . On a final note , I leave my graduate studies , not alone , but together with my fiancée , Kiran Heer . You have been an amazing beacon of encouragement during the conclusion of my degree and I simply cannot wait for what life has in store for the both of us . vi Acknowledgements Although it might go without saying , I shall express it anyways . This collection of studies truly could not have materialized without the generous help and guidance from my supervisors , collaborators , colleagues , students and volunteers . Below I would like to convey my deepest acknowledgements : I am pleased to say that it has been such a positive and memorable experience working in the Guttman lab over the past 7 years . I am extremely privileged to have embarked on a doctorate degree in this lab at Simon Fraser University . For this I must wholeheartedly thank Dr . Julian Guttman who first accepted me into his lab as a naïve undergraduate research student working under the tutelage of Dr . HT Law . Dr . Guttman is an amazing cell and microbiologist , and despite his glasses , is a great microscopist with a sharp eye for curious ( and fruitful ) phenotypes . I attribute a great deal of my passion for the biological sciences ( and in particular cell biology ) from your own passions . You have helped to shape the way I ponder about biology , design experiments and write manuscripts . Consequently , this has culminated in the publication of the 6 main chapters of this thesis ; 3 of which were awarded cover arts . Lastly , I thank you for giving me the freedom to explore science in your lab , and in particular , to self - initiate a study examining caveolin during Listeria monocytogenes infections . With its recent acceptance , I personally consider this project as my most ambitious and cherished contribution to your research endeavors . To Dr . Gordon Rintoul and Dr . Margo Moore , it has been an honor to have you on my PhD committee over the years and your advice and input into my work has meant a great deal to me . Over the years I have also had memorable moments working alongside you either during your courses as a TA or with your own students on various occasions in the lab . I am extremely thankful to all the collaborators here at SFU , as well as at UBC and abroad . I would like to extend a generous thank you to Dr . Wayne Vogl at UBC , who is a world - class anatomist and electron microscopist , for your work on many of my projects . It was a real privilege to witness you at work , or perhaps in a way , ‘at home’ , in the electron microscopy facility at UBC . To Drs . Carol Otey ( UNC Chapel Hill ) and Moriah Beck ( Wichita State University ) , your cellular and molecular biology expertise has proven vii invaluable in my investigation of palladin during L . monocytogenes infections . I will never forget your willingness ( and eagerness ) to collaborate , provide reagents and even perform experiments , for the palladin project . To Drs . Robert Chiu ( UCLA ) , Michael Bukrinsky ( The George Washington University ) , and Margaret Mc Gee ( University College Dublin ) , I thank you ( and your labs ) for all the help you have provided which has resulted in the publication of 4 manuscripts investigating Cyclophilin A and CD147 . To Drs . Ben Nichols ( MRC Cambridge ) , Simona Polo ( IFOM ) , Sung Hyun Kim ( Kyung Hee University ) and Carsten Hansen ( University of Edinburgh ) , I thank you all ( and your students ) for your world - class knowledge of cell biology ( and in particular , endocytosis ) , valuable reagents , and input into the caveolin manuscript ( which recently became accepted ) . Lastly , I’d like to mention the laboratories of Dr . Michael Silverman , Dr . Harald Hutter , Dr . Jonathan Choy , Dr . Fiona Brinkman , Dr . Tim Audas , Dr . Lisa Craig , Dr . Carl Lowenburger , Dr . Brett Finlay , Dr . Pascale Cossart , Dr . Pietro De Camilli , Dr . Calvin Roskelly , Dr . Alexandre Benmerah , and Dr . James Bear , for your appreciated reagents , expertise and respected advice that you have all provided towards the completion of my research projects . Lastly , to my peers ( past and present ) in the Guttman lab , you have made working ( or at times , slaving away ) in the lab a real enjoyable experience . I thank Dr . HT Law for being an incredible mentor ( and scientist ) when I first joined the lab , taking me under his wing , and later , for allowing me to take over the palladin and cyclophilin A projects as a Masters student . I do not think I would have decided to pursue this degree if you were not such an outstanding teacher . Priyanka Aggarwal , Jennifer Shen and Brittany Walker , you three were such an amazing support system and most of all , great friends that I maintain even after leaving the lab . Avneen Kooner , Kiera Warren , Katarina Lulic , Connie Yu and Diana Yang , you all have been such wonderful students to have worked alongside . The work you performed during your honors projects is truly remarkable and because that I am extremely proud to have you as co - authors on my projects . I hope that it’s appropriate for me to say that I have learned how to become a respectable mentor and teacher working with you all . viii Table of Contents Approval . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii Dedication . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . v Acknowledgements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi Table of Contents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . viii List of Figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xiii List of Acronyms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xvii Chapter 1 .

Introduction 1 . 1 . A brief history of actin Actin is one of the most abundant proteins found in eukaryotic cells , often accounting for ~ 10 % of total protein in metazoans 1 . Thus , it is not surprising that many essential cell biological processes such as cellular motility ( and adhesion ) 2 – 5 , intracellular transport 6 – 9 , organization of cell polarity 10 , 11 , and cytokinesis 5 , 10 – 12 , all rely on this ubiquitous family of proteins . In fact , the laundry list of actin - mediated functions is continuously expanding as more recent studies have uncovered crucial roles for actin during DNA repair 13 , 14 and even glycolysis 15 . The roots of actin can be traced back to mid twentieth century biochemical studies conducted by Albert Szent - Györgyi and colleagues who were the first to label a novel muscle tissue ( and myosin - interacting ) protein as ‘actin’ 16 . These early biochemical studies on muscle actin ( and myosin ) culminated in the first in vitro reconstitution of the muscle contractile machinery 16 , 17 . Perhaps just as important , this early work on muscle actin uncovered that in the absence or presence of salts , actin can exist in 2 forms , as single molecules ( or monomers ) termed globular actin ( G - actin ) or as long fibers ( F - actin ) respectively ( Figure 1 . 1 ) 16 , 18 . We now know that it is this intrinsic ability of actin to exist in these 2 forms that enables it to function during various cellular processes . These seminal studies paved the way for future actin research . It wasn’t until 1966 when Hatano and Oosawa identified actin in non - muscle cells 19 . Biology’s first glimpse of actin within the cell relied on early electron microscopy imaging , and in particular , thin sectioning techniques 20 – 22 . These first images provided a two - dimensional glimpse of F - actin arranged into what appeared like large bundles or fibers 20 , 22 . These initial cellular observations of actin were in fact the actin cytoskeleton , the complex network of actin filaments and other actin - associated proteins that are organized within the cell . To reveal in more structural insight , the three - dimensional structure of the actin cytoskeleton was explored . Here , researchers utilized metal replica electron microscopy 23 – 25 . These electron microscopic images provided a high - resolution view of various actin cytoskeletal components such as the migrating edge of cells ( the lamellipodium ) and thin protruding processes called filopodia 23 – 25 . With the advent of 2 immunofluorescence microscopy and development of various fluorescent probes in conjunction with actin - targeting antibodies and the purification and use of mushroom phallotoxins such as phalloidin 26 , researchers were given another avenue to examine cellular actin in more detail . Current developments such as the use of DNA plasmids encoding small fluorescently - tagged actin - binding peptides , such as LifeAct , allow researchers to examine in real - time the subcellular dynamics of F - actin within cells and tissues 27 . The development of confocal ( and now super - resolution ) microscopy platforms has enhanced our view of the actin cytoskeleton to the molecular level 28 , 29 . Genetically , humans ( and other vertebrates ) express three main isoforms of actin , α - actin , β - actin and γ - actin . Humans possess 3 α - actin genes , which are expressed in muscle ( skeletal , smooth and cardiac ) , 1 β - actin gene expressed in non - muscle cells and 2 γ - actin genes ( 1 in smooth muscle and 1 in non - muscle cells ) 5 , 30 . The actin gene is highly conserved among metazoans as it varies by only a few amino acids between animals , fungi and algae 5 , 31 . In fact , human γ - actin and the single yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) actin share ~ 91 . 2 % identity 31 . This high level of conservation likely arose because of the crucial role of actin in cells . Specifically , Pollard and colleagues propose that , since metazoan cells rely on actin to polymerize into filaments as well as maintain interactions with an abundant array of other cellular proteins , physical constraints such as ensuring the ability of actin to properly polymerize into stable and functional actin filaments as well as interact with its various binding partners , likely governs this genetic conservation 5 . Genetic duplication of the actin gene has given rise to a group of actin - related proteins commonly referred to as “Arps” 32 . At least 11 Arps ( Arp1 - Arp11 ) have been identified that possess up to ~ 50 % sequence identity with actin . Of particular interest are the Arp2 and Arp3 proteins as they belong to a 7 - subunit - containing complex known as the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is involved in generating branched arrays of F - actin ( explained in detail below ) . In addition to the Arps , several other eukaryotic proteins ( such as hexokinase and Hsc70 ) share structural 3D similarities with monomeric actin 33 , 34 . These proteins all possess a highly similar ATP - binding ATPase domain ( composed of 5 separate motifs ) 34 . Interestingly , many prokaryotes also express actin - like ( and ATPase domain - containing ) proteins 35 such as MreB 36 , ParM 37 , 38 and FtsA 39 . Spirals of polymerized MreB function to maintain the shape of bacterial cells 36 whereas ParM segregates plasmid DNA 37 , 38 and FtsA regulates cell division 39 . 3 Below , I will provide additional insight into G - and F - actin , how F - actin is generated , the role of actin - associated proteins during F - actin formation as well as a brief overview of several key actin cytoskeletal elements ( such as the lamellipodium ) that are generated in eukaryotic cells . 1 . 2 . Monomeric actin Eukaryotic actin molecules consist of a 375 amino acid polypeptide and have a molecular weight of ~ 42 kDa . The co - crystalization of G - actin - DNase I complexes ( instead of pure actin , as the propensity of pure actin to polymerize precluded crystal formation ) by Kabsch and colleagues provided the first high resolution structure of actin 40 . From this study , actin was described as having 2 major domains , with each domain further divided into 2 subdomains 40 . Actin binds ATP ( or ADP ) and this interaction occurs in the cleft found between the 2 major domains of actin 41 . Tight binding ( in the nanomolar K d range ) between ATP ( or ADP ) and actin requires the presence of Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + ions 5 . Arguably the most important feature of actin is its ability to form long thin polymers . In the presence of divalent ( Mg 2 + ) or monovalent ( K + or Na + ) ions , G - actin will self - polymerize into filaments ( F - actin ) 16 , 18 , 41 . Conversely , in the absence of salts , F - actin will depolymerize into actin monomers . Although self - polymerization can occur spontaneously , polymerization begins with a lag period , leading up to the formation of short stable oligomers that precede fast assembly of longer filaments ( Figure 1 . 1 ) 42 . As we will see later , a decrease in this lag period as well as increased assembly of F - actin can occur in the presence of certain actin - associated proteins . Importantly , the concentration of free actin monomers is also crucial to filament elongation as a high concentration of G - actin favours filament assembly 4 , 4 , 41 , 42 . More recent advances in actin studies have examined post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) of G - actin 43 as well as the transport and functional role of actin in the nuclear environment 13 , 44 – 46 . Actin molecules can undergo several PTMs such as acetylation , arginylation , O - GlcNAcylation , phosphorylation and ubiquitination 43 . Actin in the nucleus predominantly exists as monomeric actin 14 ; however , nuclear actin filaments have been observed on occasion 14 . The transport of actin into the nucleus is mediated by the actin - binding protein cofilin and importin 9 45 . Currently , the major function of monomeric actin in the nucleus revolves around chromatin - remodelling 44 . Astonishingly , despite the 4 general absence of F - actin within the nucleus , new insight into DNA repair mechanisms link F - actin , and not G - actin , to these processes 13 . 1 . 3 . Filamentous actin – actin polymerization dynamics The transformation of G - actin into F - actin , and vice versa , governs most cellular processes that rely on actin . One crucial function of F - actin is its ability to transduce force to generate motility of the cell . Cellular migration 2 – 4 , endocytosis 6 and even DNA strand repair 13 all rely on the ability of F - actin to generate propulsive forces and / or relocalize particles . Generally , the way this occurs is via the polymerization of actin filaments into networked arrays ( Figure 1 . 2 ) 4 , 6 , 42 . In the cell , ATP - bound actin molecules join together ( head - to - tail ) eventually forming 3 - 4 subunit length oligomers ( or seeds ) . At this stage elongation of the actin seed into long filaments occurs . The head - to - tail polymerization of actin gives the filament structural polarity 4 , 5 , 41 , 42 . This polarity can be observed clearly in myosin decoration experiments of F - actin 5 , 47 – 49 . One end is termed the barbed ( + , plus ) end and the other the pointed ( - , minus ) end . Crucially , actin subunits are added much more rapidly at the barbed end then they are at the minus end 4 , 5 , 42 . This is due to the differing critical concentration ( C c ) values ( when the concentration of the G - actin pool is in equilibrium with F - actin ) at each polar end . The C c value at the barbed end is ~ 0 . 1 µM and ~ 0 . 8 µM at the minus end 1 . Essentially , when critical concentrations are high , G - actin is added to both ends . At intermediate values , G - actin is only added to the barbed end . When C c values are below 0 . 1 µM , no filament elongation occurs . It is at these more intermediate C c values where G - actin is continuously being turned over at the filament . The simultaneous addition and removal of actin monomers , termed treadmilling , underlies the mechanism behind actin force propulsion found at the leading edge ( lamellipodium ) of migrating cells 4 , 50 . However , treadmilling of pure actin in vitro occurs very slowly 4 . Thus , the cell must rely on other actin - associated factors to accelerate actin filament treadmilling ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . One such factor is the actin - binding protein profilin , which brings ATP - G - actin to the barbed end for insertion into the growing filament 5 , 41 . ATP hydrolysis ultimately results in ADP - actin at the pointed end of filaments . Other actin - associated proteins ( see below ) , remove these ADP - actin molecules from the pointed end . To recirculate these ADP - actin molecules , profilin catalyses the exchange of ADP for ATP and thus transports newly ATP - bound G - actin molecules to the growing barbed end 4 . 5 As previously mentioned , the cell utilizes actin to carry out many vital biological processes such as cell migration 2 – 4 and endocytosis 6 . In order for actin to promote these crucial processes , F - actin must be organized into one of two specific types of networked arrays , 1 ) tightly packed bundles of unbranched actin filaments ( termed parallel F - actin ) and 2 ) highly dynamic branched meshwork’s of F - actin ( termed branched F - actin ) . To generate these complex structures , cells rely on a group of robust actin - associated proteins commonly referred to actin nucleators . The seven subunit - containing Arp2 / 3 complex is well known to generate branched F - actin arrays 23 , 51 , 52 whereas members of the formin family of actin nucleators direct the formation of unbranched actin filaments 53 – 56 . Together , with an assortment of actin - associated proteins , these actin nucleators establish a functional actin cytoskeleton within the cell . 1 . 3 . 1 . Branched actin – Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization Identification and characterization of the Arp2 / 3 complex largely took off in the early 1990’s with the pioneering research of Thomas Pollard and colleagues who purified a 7 - polypeptide complex , now recognized as the Arp2 / 3 complex , from the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellan ( Acanthamoeba ) 57 . The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of Arp3 , Arp2 , p41 / ARPC1 , p34 / ARPC2 , p21 / ARPC3 , p20 / ARPC4 and p16 / ARPC5 ( note : the “p # # ” designation indicates the apparent molecular weight of the initial subunits purified as determined by immunoblotting ) . Biochemical studies demonstrated that the Arp2 / 3 complex contains one copy each of the seven subunits 58 . Of particular interest was the discovery that the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits share sequence and structural identity to actin 57 . Importantly , research out of the Pollard lab confirmed actin - binding by the Arp2 / 3 complex as the complex was found attached to the sides of preformed actin filaments by electron microscopy 58 . Some of the earliest studies at the ultrastructural level had uncovered that the motile edge of eukaryotic cells ( lamellipodium ) consisted of a dense network of highly branched F - actin 24 , 59 – 61 . These early micrographs depicted a highly interwoven network of actin filaments at the motile leading edge of cells with what appeared to be electron dense clusters attached to the sides of filaments as well as at the branching point of two filaments . In 1998 , Pollard and colleagues had finally made the breakthrough in identifying the Arp2 / 3 complex as the factor that could bind to the sides of actin filaments at their pointed ends , protecting them from disassembly and , amazingly , nucleate new actin 6 filaments branches that would grow outwards from their barbed ends 51 . Remarkably , these new daughter filaments grew away from their site of attachment on the mother filaments at a consistent 70° angle 51 . Approximately a year later , the Arp2 / 3 complex was immunolocalized at the ultrastructural level at the exact branching site of the characteristic y - shaped and 70° angle actin filaments within the lamellipodium 23 . Functionally however , the Arp2 / 3 complex alone is intrinsically inactive and thus requires the presence of another class of proteins , called the nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , to become active 62 , 63 . Classically , the Neural Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( N - WASp ) is depicted as the activator of Arp2 / 3 62 – 66 . However , the first activator of Arp2 / 3 characterized was the Listeria monocytogenes ( L . monocytogenes ) surface protein , ActA , which structurally mimics eukaryotic N - WASP 52 , 67 . As we will see in subsequent sections , activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by ActA ( and other bacterial proteins ) allows intracellular ( and extracellular ) bacteria to generate branched actin - containing motile structures . Additional eukaryotic Arp2 / 3 NPFs have been discovered such as cortactin 63 , 68 – 71 , Abp1 72 – 74 , Scar / WAVE 63 , 75 – 83 , WASH 63 , 84 – 89 , WHAMM 63 , 90 and JMY 63 , 91 . While Arp2 / 3 and its associated NPFs are classically considered as cytosolic , evidence of nuclear - localized F - actin , Arp2 / 3 , WASP and JMY reveal an increased complexity in how Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization is regulated 13 , 46 , 92 . Some of the major actin - based elements generated in cells using the Arp2 / 3 complex ( see below ) , include motile lamellipodia 23 , 61 , 93 , 94 , endocytic invaginations 6 , 7 , 95 – 99 , adhesive ( and matrix degrading ) podosomes / invadopodia 100 – 104 as well as several types of motile bacterially - derived structures 52 , 105 – 110 . 1 . 3 . 2 . Parallel actin – Formin - mediated actin polymerization Only a few higher order actin structures , such as subset of stress fibers ( see below ) 111 , 112 , rely solely on parallel actin arrays . Rather , the majority of cellular ( and bacterially - derived ) actin structures depend on cooperation between both branched and parallel actin polymerization machineries for their proper formation 23 , 93 , 94 , 113 – 115 . An Arp2 / 3 - independent mechanism promotes the generation of unbranched actin filaments , which are later incorporated into parallel arrays . To accomplish this , the cell relies on a group of nucleators called the formin family of proteins 53 – 56 , 116 . 7 Formins are large multi - domain containing proteins 53 , 55 , 56 . The characteristic feature of formins is their formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain 56 , 117 – 119 . Importantly , formins dimerize , and it is this feature that is a prerequisite for the proper actin filament elongating activity of formins 56 , 120 – 125 . The dimerization of formins brings together the FH2 domains of each monomer into a ring - shaped structure 56 , 126 – 128 . Actin filament elongation by formins begins with the generation of short unstable actin seeds 54 . Electron microscopy studies revealed FH2 - mediated formin binding at the barbed ends of these short actin seeds 54 . At the barbed ends of actin filaments , these FH2 rings incorporate actin monomers processively , thus elongating the filament 54 . The formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domain , another domain within formin , accelerates filament elongation by delivering G - actin - profilin complexes to FH2 bound at the filament barbed end 117 , 127 , 129 – 132 . The continued step - wise incorporation of actin molecules by formins generates long unbranched actin filaments . While evidence suggests formins can also directly bundle these filaments into larger parallel arrays 133 , 134 , most models depict a subset of actin - associated proteins ( termed actin crosslinkers ; see below ) which bundle actin . 1 . 4 . Actin - rich cellular structures Note : Many of the proteins described in this section will be reviewed in more detail in section 1 . 5 of this introduction . As noted above , the cell polymerizes actin into branched and parallel filament arrays which then organize into several complex well - defined structures . Two major functions of these dynamic structures are promoting cellular motility ( lamellipodia and filopodia ) and adhesion / mechanotransduction ( stress fibers ) ( Figures 1 . 3 - 1 . 4 ) . Two additional actin - rich structures described in this thesis ( and in more detail in the sections below ) are those generated during the internalization of extracellular cargo ( see section 1 . 6 . 3 ) and those induced by microbial pathogens during infections ( see sections 1 . 8 - 1 . 9 ) . It should be noted that the majority of the work presented in the following chapters of this thesis focuses heavily on these pathogen - derived actin - based structures ; however , insight into the aforementioned actin - rich cellular structures is crucial as these microbes frequently exploit the proteins that generate them . 8 1 . 4 . 1 . Lamellipodia In 1970 , Michael Abercrombie’s phase - contrast imaging of embryonic fibroblasts revealed a broad and flat , highly motile ruffle , at the edge of actively migrating cells 135 . In that same study , Abercrombie and colleagues coined the name “lamellipodium” for this protrusive structure . One year later , electron microscopic images revealed actin filaments with lamellipodia 20 . These pioneering studies paved the way for our current knowledge on how eukaryotic cells move in culture and in vivo . Actin polymerization at the extreme edge of the lamellipodium ( directly behind the plasma membrane ) , provides the propulsive forces required to move cells forward 51 , 63 , 136 – 141 . The major nucleator of actin at lamellipodia is the Arp2 / 3 complex 23 , 51 , 94 , 142 . Together with several other actin - associated proteins ( described in detail below ) such as the NPFs [ N - WASp / WAVE ] , VASP and cofilin , the Arp2 / 3 - based actin polymerization machinery generates a highly dynamic and rapidly turning over , meshwork of filamentous actin ( Figure 1 . 3 ) 4 , 42 . Several lines of evidence point towards a crucial role for the Arp2 / 3 complex during cell motility . Firstly , electron microscopic examination of the leading edge of cells reveals the 70° branches of actin filaments that are characteristic of the Arp2 / 3 complex 51 . Most importantly , in cells depleted of Arp2 / 3 , lamellipodia are absent and cellular motility is significantly perturbed 94 , 142 . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex begins at the plasma membrane . Following interactions between extracellular stimuli such as cytokines and growth factors and their corresponding receptors , several Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA are recruited and activated to the plasma membrane 139 . Actin polymerization by Arp2 / 3 begins following recruitment and activation of NPFs such as N - WASp and WAVE by these Rho GTPases 63 . 1 . 4 . 2 . Filopodia Filopodia are thin cellular projections involved in cell motility and exploratory processes ( Figure 1 . 3 ) 25 , 42 , 143 – 145 . In contrast to lamellipodia , actin filaments within filopodia are organized into tightly packed parallel bundles 25 , 143 , 144 , 146 . The major organizer of these actin filament bundles is fascin , as in cells depleted of fascin , fewer filopodia are generated and any remaining ones appear morphologically abnormal and collapse near 9 the cell surface 146 , 147 . Elongation of filopodia is mainly driven by the formin family of actin nucleators such as mDia2 148 – 151 . As in lamellipodia , actin nucleation is dependent on Rho GTPases , such as Cdc42 and RhoF / Rif 148 , 152 – 154 . Other actin - associated proteins such as VASP likely aid in the elongation of filaments as in cells inhibited of VASP , filopodia are fewer in number and shorter in length 155 – 159 . 1 . 4 . 3 . Stress Fibers Stress fibers are a prominent feature of many types of cultured animal cells ( Figure 1 . 4 ) 111 , 160 . Structurally , stress fibers consist of multiple actin filaments ( ~ 10 - 30 ) that are directly crosslinked together by α - actinin 160 . The relatively long actin filaments within stress fibers are generated via RhoA - mediated activation of the formin mDia1 131 , 160 – 165 . Functionally , stress fibers generate contractile forces within the cell 111 , 160 , 166 – 168 . The force for contraction is provided by the ATPase myosin II 160 . Thus , stress fibers play a key role during cellular processes that rely on tension and contraction , namely adhesion and mechanotransduction 160 , 169 – 173 . The exact role of stress fibers during cellular migration is less clear ; however , a subtype of stress fibers , termed transverse arc , are present within lamella , a broader array of linear actin filaments that is found behind lamellipodia 160 , 162 , 166 , 174 , 175 . Cellular adhesion to rigid surfaces , such as glass coverslips , provide the stress ( or tension ) necessary for stress fiber formation . Cells in vivo generally do not associate with such rigid substrates and thus the majority of cells in living animals do not possess stress fibers . However ; there exists one cell type which does in fact experience sufficient stresses that warrant the need for stress fiber formation . These are the endothelial cells which line blood vessels 176 . These stress fibers likely protect the endothelial lining from shear stresses experienced due to blood flow 177 . 1 . 5 . Important actin - associated proteins Actin alone ( and in the presence of salts ) self - polymerizes into filaments 18 and reconstitution assays that combine purified actin together with 5 other actin - associated proteins ( ADF / cofilin , profilin , capping protein , Arp2 / 3 and an NPF [ e . g . N - WASp ] ) generate branched actin arrays in vitro 107 . These in vitro arrays of actin exhibit force propulsion of particles 107 . Importantly , the actin filament arrays ( both branched and parallel ) generated inside the cell drive whole cell movement through lamellipodia and 10 filopodia 142 . While we have seen the major nucleators that drive the formation of these branched ( via Arp2 / 3 ) or parallel ( via formins ) F - actin array - containing cellular structures , the cell also depends on a more expansive arsenal of actin - associated proteins to regulate the dynamics of these cytoskeletal elements 4 , 5 , 178 , 179 . These actin - associated proteins belong to over 60 different classes 4 and perform a variety of functions within the actin - rich cellular structures . Below , I will review only a subset of classical actin - associated proteins as well as several proteins which pertain specifically to my research that is covered in later chapters . 1 . 5 . 1 . Filamentous actin stabilizers – crosslinkers and bundlers Although metazoan cells have evolved robust machineries to generate actin filaments , continued elongation will ultimately collapse them 4 , 5 , 180 , 181 . To overcome these physical constraints , cells possess a variety of actin - binding proteins that crosslink filaments along their entire length , thus increasing their overall rigidity 4 , 5 , 178 , 179 . Generally , these actin - binding proteins connect 2 separate filaments together . To accomplish this , actin crosslinkers ( and bundlers ) usually dimerize such as α - actinin 182 – 185 and palladin 186 – 188 as each monomer possess a single actin - binding domain . Alternatively , some actin crosslinkers , such as fascin 189 , 190 and fimbrin 191 , 192 possess 2 internal actin - binding domains . Higher - order actin structures such as lamellipodia , filopodia and stress fibers are further stabilized as these actin - binding proteins are studded along the majority of filaments within the networked array 4 , 5 , 178 , 179 . α - actinin In order to crosslink actin filaments , α - actinin molecules combine as anti - parallel homodimers 182 – 185 . Consequently , each end of the α - actinin dimer possesses actin - binding activity . Because of the relatively long spacer region which separates the two actin - binding domains , actin filaments bound by α - actinin are bundled less tightly ( with more open space between filaments ) than those crosslinked by proteins such as fimbrin or fascin ( see below ) . In the cell , α - actinin classically localizes to stress fibers as well as focal adhesions 193 – 197 . At stress fibers , the loosely packed filaments leave space for myosin integration which is necessary for efficient contractility of the cell 160 , 162 , 198 . The importance of α - actinin is highlighted by several observations of reduced stress fiber formation in cells absent ( or inhibited ) of α - actinin 199 . However , the role of α - actinin is not 11 strictly limited to stress fibers , as in cells depleted of α - actinin , widespread cytoskeletal alterations are also observed at lamellipodia and focal adhesions 200 . Palladin Palladin is an actin - binding protein that exists as 9 isoforms which are differentially expressed in a variety of tissues ( Figure 1 . 5 ) 201 – 203 . The 90 kDa isoform ( also called isoform # 4 ) of palladin is currently the best characterized and only variant of palladin that is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells 201 . In cultured cells , palladin localizes to various actin - rich structures such as contractile - based stress fibres and muscle sarcomeres as well as cell anchoring sites such as podosomes and focal adhesions 202 , 204 ( p8 ) . Palladin is also enriched at the leading edge of lamellipodia 205 . Structurally , palladin is composed of 3 - 5 ( isoform dependent ) immunoglobulin - like ( Ig ) domains . The actin - binding region of palladin has been linked specifically to Ig - like domains 3 and 4 of palladin and both of these domains display actin - crosslinking and bundling activities in vitro ( Figure 1 . 5 ) 186 , 187 . Specifically , three key lysine residues ( K15 , K18 and K51 ) within Ig - like domain 3 , control palladins actin - binding activity 187 . Furthermore , in cells expressing a palladin variant mutated at these three residues , actin cytoskeletal networks are significantly perturbed and cells display abnormal shape morphologies 187 . Similarly to α - actinin , palladin dimerizes upon actin - binding , and this likely facilitates its actin - crosslinking activity 188 . Currently , the remaining Ig - like domains of palladin show no role in crosslinking actin . Remarkably , recent biochemical studies out of the Beck lab has demonstrated that purified palladin , when co - incubated with actin monomers , generate branched F - actin arrays 206 . However , whether or not palladin can function as a bona fide actin nucleator ( like the Arp2 / 3 complex ) in living cells remains unknown . In addition to crosslinking and nucleating actin , palladin also functions as a cytosolic scaffolding protein by binding to actin and various actin - associated proteins such as α - actinin 207 , ezrin 202 , VASP 205 and CLP36 208 . As a scaffold , palladin likely recruits these actin - associated proteins to their normal destination within the cytoskeleton . Evidence for this comes from Gateva and colleagues , who showed that VASP - mediated actin stress fiber formation in U2OS cells depends on the presence of the VASP - binding domain of palladin 209 . 12 VASP VASP is another multi - functional actin - associated protein . VASP is found in various cell types and has important roles in various cell biological processes such as cell motility , filopodia formation and neuronal outgrowth 157 , 158 , 210 – 218 . Bacterial pathogens such as L . monocytogenes utilize VASP for their own efficient intracellular actin - based motility 219 – 221 . Functionally , VASP likely elongates actin filaments via a process termed “anti - capping” 216 , 222 . To do this , VASP binds the barbed ends of filaments and simultaneously blocks incoming capping proteins from terminating filament growth 216 , 223 . Tetramerization also imparts VASP with actin - bundling activity ; however , this activity is restricted in cells to regions such as the tips of filopodia 156 , 224 , 225 . Fascin Fascin is widely regarded as the prototypical actin - bundling protein found in protrusive cellular projections , namely filopodia , microvilli and cancer - specific invadopodia 226 – 232 . Unlike α - actinin and palladin , a single molecule of fascin possesses two separate actin - binding sites 189 , 190 . Consequently , actin - crosslinking by fascin generates more tightly packed bundles of F - actin 147 , 233 , 234 . In cells depleted of fascin , fewer filopodia and invadopodia are formed and these structures appear morphologically abnormal 147 , 232 . Functionally , the fascin - mediated tight bundling of parallel F - actin arrays likely imparts a high degree of stiffness to the protrusive actin structures . This is further supported by the finding of thicker and longer microvilli in cells overexpressing fascin 231 . 1 . 5 . 2 . Actin depolymerization factors and capping proteins While there are several mechanisms that promote actin nucleation and filament formation , cells do not possess an unlimited supply of actin monomers . Thus , the cytoskeleton relies on actin - binding proteins that sever filament ends , leading to the release of free actin molecules back into the cytosol . Unregulated and widespread growth of actin filaments in fact perturbs the proper function of actin - based structures . Therefore , the cell also utilizes a group of proteins which cap the ends of filaments ( commonly referred to as capping proteins ) . These capping proteins restrict the elongation of actin filaments to only productive regions such as the leading of the lamellipodia 4 . 13 ADF / cofilin Cofilin ( originally known as actin depolymerizing factor [ ADF ] ) , is one of the major actin severing proteins 235 . To do this , cofilin binds preferentially to the sides of filaments enriched with ADP - bound actin 23 . As a result , cofilin mainly severs actin from the pointed end of filaments 23 , 235 , 236 . As mentioned above , cofilin - mediated severing restores actin monomers back into the cytosol . In conjunction with the ability of profilin to accelerate the exchange of ADP for ATP , cofilin accelerates overall actin filament turnover rates 236 . Proper filament turnover plays a crucial part in motile structures ( described below ) such as lamellipodia , filopodia and some bacterially - derived structures 4 , 23 , 237 , 238 . 1 . 5 . 3 . Membrane - cytoskeletal linkers The physical connection of the actin cytoskeleton with the surface of the cell plays a crucial role in orchestrating many cell biological processes . Below , I will outline the major group of proteins that bind ( and link ) F - actin to components of the plasma membrane . ERM proteins – ezrin , radixin and moesin A small family of proteins , termed the ERM proteins , possess the ability to simultaneously bind components of the plasma membrane and filamentous actin . Importantly , this interaction directly links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane 239 , 240 . This group of proteins consists of ezrin , radixin and moesin 239 , 241 , 242 . Ezrin is the most studied of these proteins and will be examined in further detail in subsequent chapters of this thesis . In the cell , these proteins are commonly found at protrusive structures such as lamellipodia , filopodia and microvilli , as well as at focal adhesions . Ezrin is crucial for the ability of normal and cancer cells to migrate 239 , 240 , 243 – 248 . The bacterial pathogen , L . monocytogenes also relies on ezrin for the proper formation of their own motile actin - based structures 249 . Structurally , these proteins contain an N - terminal membrane binding site called the FERM domain which is followed by a small central linker region , and then , C - terminal F - actin binding site . Functionally , ERM proteins are locked in a closed ( non - actin and non - membrane binding ) inactive state 250 – 252 . Activation follows their direct interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) lipid species at the plasma membrane 239 , 253 – 14 255 . F - actin binding by ERM proteins is further augmented by phosphorylation of the proteins at key threonine residues 256 , 257 . Spectrin Spectrin belongs to another group of actin - binding proteins that generate cytoskeletal - membrane networks . In fact , these networks are not solely limited to the plasma membrane as spectrin arrays also support other membrane - bound organelles such as the Golgi and nuclear envelope 258 – 267 . Spectrin networks are composed of α - and β - spectrin tetramers which bind to F - actin and the spectrin - associated proteins such as adducin , protein 4 . 1 and ankyrin 267 – 271 . 1 . 5 . 4 . Non - actin - binding proteins So far , we have covered components of the actin cytoskeleton that function as direct interactors of monomeric or filamentous actin . However , proper functioning of the actin cytoskeleton also relies on countless other factors that do not directly interact with it . These factors include plasma membrane receptors , molecular chaperones and various enzymes . Below are two non - actin - binding proteins that are generally not considered part of the actin cytoskeleton but are crucial in its proper functioning . We will examine these proteins in much more detail in chapters 4 through 7 . Cyclophilin A Cyclophilin A ( CypA ) is a small ( 18 kDa ) and abundantly expressed cytosolic ( and secreted ) eukaryotic enzyme 272 – 274 . CypA was the first characterized member of a family of 7 human molecular chaperones , termed the cyclophilins 275 – 277 . The initial studies of CypA came about from Handschumacher and colleagues who demonstrated that CypA was the binding partner of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A ( CsA ) 276 . Today , the cyclophilins are well - known to possess peptidyl prolyl isomerase ( PPIase ) activity , which catalyzes the transformation of peptide bonds between trans and cis forms at proline residues 278 . Functionally , CypA is vital for several normal and pathological processes . Intracellularly , CypA is well known to participate in protein trafficking as well as protein folding ( and refolding ) processes 278 – 288 . CypA is a common target of several relevant human viral 15 pathogens such as HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , influenza , vaccinia and cytomegalovirus 279 , 289 – 294 . During these infections , CypA interacts with various capsid and accessory components and these interactions ultimately lead to increased virion formation and infectivity of cells 279 , 285 , 295 , 296 . CypA is also secreted from cells and this form of CypA ( eCypA ) promotes the inflammatory response in cells 297 , 298 . CypA does not possess any intrinsic actin - binding activity ; however , several studies point towards CypA expression as an important factor for several cell biological processes that utilize actin , namely cell migration and cytoskeletal remodelling 274 , 299 , 300 . Despite these findings , the precise role of CypA during these actin - based events remains unclear . CD147 CD147 ( also called basigin or EMMPRIN ) is a plasma membrane receptor protein and well - known binding partner of CypA 301 . In humans , CD147 exists as 2 isoforms , basigin - 1 ( BGS - 1 ) and basigin - 2 ( BSG - 2 ) . BSG - 1 is retina - specific , whereas BSG - 2 is more widely expressed , thus the use of “CD147” commonly designates the latter variant 302 – 307 . Structurally , CD147 belongs to the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) superfamily of proteins as it consists of 2 extracellular facing Ig domains 302 . These extracellular Ig domains allow CD147 molecules to interact in a trans manner with components on the surface of other neighboring cells such as selectins and other CD147 molecules 302 , 306 , 308 , 309 . CD147 can also interact in a cis - like fashion with other membrane proteins such as monocarboxylate transporters 310 , 311 , CD44 312 , 313 , gamma - secretase 314 , NOD2 315 , and Syndecan - 1 316 . In the context of the actin cytoskeleton , CD147 expression in cell culture is required for the proper formation of several protrusive actin - rich structures such as lamellipodia , filopodia and invadopodia 317 – 320 . CD147 also mediates leukocyte migration ( chemotaxis ) via its interaction with extracellular CypA 321 – 323 . However , like CypA , CD147 does not possess any direct actin - binding capabilities , thus how might CD147 regulate motile actin - based dynamics ? Insight into this comes from Grass and colleagues investigation of invadopodia , whereby CD147 expression was found to maintain lipid rafts containing CD44 and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) 312 . Activated EGFR within these rafts then triggers Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization through recruitment of the NPF cortactin 324 . Recent investigation into the actin - hijacking bacterium , Neisseria meningitidis ( N . meningitidis ) , has also uncovered direct binding between the cytoplasmic facing tail of 16 CD147 and the α - actinin family member , α - actinin 4 , 325 . This interaction facilitates actin filament assembly by the bacteria during their colonization of endothelial cells . Importantly , whether or not CD147 - α - actinin 4 complexes organizes actin filaments normally in cells remains unknown . 1 . 6 . Endocytosis The eukaryotic cell depends on the plasma membrane for much of its cellular signalling , and crucially , the uptake of membrane lipids , proteins and extracellular molecules 326 – 333 . Endocytosis involves a number of mechanisms by which the cell can internalize a wide variety of differently sized molecules , ranging from small growth factors and nutrients to whole cells 326 – 333 . Certain cell types , such as macrophages , can even engulf entire cells via a process termed efferocytosis 334 . Endocytosis also provides a means for the cell to recycle plasmalemmal components , such as transmembrane receptor proteins , back into the cell 328 , 330 , 331 , 335 – 337 . Given the wide range in cargo type ( and size ) , the cell has evolved various endocytic pathways , each distinguished by the size of particles they can internalize into the cell ( Figure 1 . 6 ) . Importantly , for many human pathogens , endocytosis represents the sole passageway into the host intracellular environment 338 – 346 . For the uptake of large cargo , such as extracellular bacteria or solutes / nutrients , the cell commonly utilizes two major mechanisms , phagocytosis and macropinocytosis respectively 330 . These pathways generally rely on actin cytoskeletal rearrangements at the membrane resulting in the formation of membranous protrusions or ruffles 6 , 330 . However , the cell can also internalize extracellular ligands such as signalling molecules and growth factors by forming small bulbous invaginations at the plasma membrane . This small - scale endocytic pathway utilizes small ( ~ 60 - 150 nm in diameter ) membrane vesicles to transport cargo into the cell 326 , 328 . Interestingly , several bacterial pathogens have evolved mechanisms to usurp the nanometer - scale size limit of these endocytic mechanisms during their infections 338 , 339 , 347 – 349 . Below , I will focus on the two major nanometer - scale endocytic mechanisms that cells rely on to internalize small cargo : 1 ) clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the most well - studied endocytic mechanism ( Figure 1 . 7 ) , and 2 ) caveolin - mediated endocytosis , a seemingly less vital endocytic pathway with emerging links to overall plasma membrane composition and dynamics ( Figure 1 . 8 ) . 17 1 . 6 . 1 . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Clathrin - mediated endocytosis describes a receptor - mediated mechanism of endocytic vesicle formation . To accomplish this , a complex machinery of endocytic proteins assembles at the plasma membrane and carries out a finely - tuned procedure which involves curving of the membrane into an initial endocytic pit , formation of a structural coat around the growing invagination , elongation of the invagination , and eventually , freeing ( scission ) of the budding vesicle into the cytosol ( Figure 1 . 7 ) 328 , 329 , 333 . This endocytic process is characterized by the appearance of an ordered lattice of clathrin proteins around the forming vesicle 328 , 329 , 333 . Additionally , more than 50 different proteins from the cytosol are recruited over the course of the entire process 328 , 329 , 333 , 350 . Along with clathrin , these endocytic components are arranged into highly ordered and specific spatial arrangements about the membrane 328 , 329 , 333 , 350 . Additionally , many of these proteins ( including clathrin ) have been shown to arrive and leave in a specific timed sequence during vesicle formation 350 . Consequently , clathrin - mediated endocytosis can be broken - down into a few well - defined steps which will be outlined below ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . Following receptor - ligand interactions at the membrane , a cascade of events is initiated , beginning with the initiation of the formation of an endocytic invagination ( or bud ) . Clustering of a subset of endocytic - associated proteins at the site of vesicle formation provides a nucleation site for the assembly of the clathrin coat . These early coat proteins generally consist of scaffolding and adaptor proteins such as FCHo1 , FCHo2 , the AP2 complex , AP180 , Eps15 and intersectins 1 and 2 and epsin - 1 328 , 329 , 351 – 357 . Recruitment of these proteins generally depends on their binding to phospholipids , namely PIP2 , at the vesicle formation site 328 , 329 , 354 , 358 – 362 . The main function of these proteins is to 1 ) sculpt an initial pit by bending the plasma membrane 2 ) load cargo towards the site of vesicle formation and 3 ) recruit clathrin for coat formation 328 , 329 . Structurally , the BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) domain - containing proteins such as FCHO1 / 2 and amphiphysin , are intrinsically “banana - shaped” , and thus , upon their binding to the membrane , form it into a concave - like contour 352 , 363 . Epsin - 1 and AP180 interact with PIP2 via their helical epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domains 354 , 364 . Membrane bending is induced following the direct insertion of the ENTH domain into the lipid bilayer 364 . Eps15 also induces membrane bending through its Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain 365 , 366 . Important membrane cargos are recruited to the eventual vesicle - forming region through adaptors 18 such as AP2 , FCHo1 and Eps15 328 , 329 , 355 , 361 . Important cargo to be internalized are often modified via ubiquitylation and / or phosphorylation 367 – 369 . These modifications can then be recognized by proteins such as epsin - 1 369 . The major clathrin adaptor , AP2 , initiates clathrin recruitment and thus directly links the clathrin coat to the membrane - bound cargo 361 , 370 , 371 . Coat formation is further stabilized via AP2 interactions with Eps15 , as in cells expressing a non - AP2 binding mutant of Eps15 , endocytosis is inhibited 372 . The clathrin coat itself was first visualized by electron microscopy in 1964 by Roth and Porter , who discovered “bristle - coated” vesicles in mosquito oocytes 373 . It wasn’t until mid - 1970 when Barbara Pearse first isolated and characterized the bristle coat vesicle protein as clathrin 374 , 375 . Structurally , clathrin consists of a heavy and light chain 374 – 378 . Joining of three clathrin molecules into a triskelion shape constitutes the major subunit of the coat 378 , 379 . Interaction between multiple triskelia eventually form the characteristic polygonal lattice that is the clathrin coat 378 – 380 . As mentioned above , clathrin adapters such as AP2 , link the clathrin coat to the vesicle 361 , 370 , 371 , 381 . The clathrin coat could aid in membrane curvature induction ; however , given that clathrin does not directly insert into the membrane , these forces are believed to be insignificant 382 . The final two steps in the endocytic process involve scission of the budding vesicle from the plasma membrane , and subsequently , disassembly of the clathrin coat from the free vesicle . Separation of the budding vesicle from the plasma membrane classically involves the GTPase dynamin 383 – 390 . To do this , dynamin molecules assemble into a tight helical - shaped collar around the neck - region which links the circular vesicle to the plasma membrane 384 – 386 . Using GTP , dynamin pinches the neck - region until the vesicle is finally resolved 387 – 390 . Following this , the molecular chaperone , heat shock cognate 70 ( Hsc70 ) , and its binding partner , auxilin , interact with and dislodge the clathrin coat , finally releasing the vesicle into the cytosol 350 , 391 – 394 . 1 . 6 . 2 . Caveolin - mediated endocytosis There exist several mechanisms of small - scale endocytosis that do not rely on clathrin 326 , 327 , 330 – 332 , 395 , 396 . These pathways , commonly referred to as clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) , utilize a different array of proteins as well as function beyond simply internalizing cargo 326 , 327 , 330 – 332 , 335 ( p6 ) , 395 , 397 , 398 , 399 ( p2 ) , 400 ( p2 ) , 401 . Of these CIE mechanisms , the most well - studied is caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( Figure 1 . 8 ) . However , as well will see 19 below , there exists some controversy in the field as to the exact extent by which cells employ caveolin endocytosis to internalize cargo 326 , 327 , 402 – 404 . The origins of caveolin - mediated endocytosis can be traced back to the fine examination of endothelial tissue by George Palade in 1953 405 . Palade’s electron micrographs depicted small ( ~ 50 - 100 nm diameter ) flask - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane 405 . In 1955 , Yamada identified similar “small pit - like depressions” ( or invaginations ) in gall bladder epithelia , coining the name caveolae or “little caves” 406 . Since then , caveolae have been observed in many cell types and are especially abundant in endothelial , muscle and fat cells 327 , 405 . Early ultrastructural examination of caveolae often revealed a filament - or striated - like coat surrounding the cytoplasmic surface of the structures 407 – 410 . It wasn’t until 1992 when Rothberg and colleagues ( out of Richard Anderson’s lab ) identified the first caveolae coat protein , which they named caveolin 411 . In their study , immunofluorescence localization of caveolin was depicted as small puncta in the cell 411 . Indeed , immunogold electron microscopy confirmed caveolin presence at caveolae 411 . There are three caveolin isoforms in humans , caveolins 1 - 3 . Caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) , the archetypal variant , is expressed in various non - muscle cells , and importantly , is crucial for caveolar biogenesis . The evidence for this comes from Cav1 overexpression studies showing 1 ) the restoration of caveolae to Cav1 knockout cells and 2 ) the de novo formation of caveolae in cells that do not normally generate them 327 . However , overexpression of Cav1 in endothelial cells does not increase their number of caveolae 327 . Furthermore , there are suggestions that caveolin expression is not entirely prognosticate of caveolae as certain cells types express caveolin but do not possess any noticeable caveolae 412 – 415 . Caveolin - 2 ( Cav2 ) is expressed similarly to Cav1 but is dispensable for caveolar formation ; as of yet , its exact cellular function remains unclear 326 , 416 . Caveolin - 3 ( Cav3 ) is a muscle specific variant , and like Cav1 , is a crucial factor in caveolae formation as mice knocked - out for Cav3 show a loss of sarcolemma caveolae 417 – 419 . Similar to the formation of clathrin - coated pits , caveolae are comprised of , and depend on , accessory proteins ( Figure 1 . 8 ) 326 , 327 , 399 ( p2 ) . The major accessory to caveolin are the cavin family of proteins , of which there are four members , cavins 1 - 4 327 , 401 , 420 – 424 . Although cavin - 4 is muscle specific , all cavins have been identified at caveolae 327 , 401 , 421 – 424 . Functionally , the cavins are required for caveolae generation 400 , 401 , 425 – 428 . Additionally , 20 Cav1 expression and proper localization to the plasma membrane appears to depend on cavin expression in some cases 327 , 400 . An important feature of cavins is their ability to form complexes 401 , 426 , 429 . However , the exact degree to which caveolae are coated by cavin complexes remains muddied by several findings . Firstly , not all Cav1 plasma membrane puncta contain the cavins 426 . Secondly , Cav1 has also been shown to be absent at various cavin puncta 401 , 426 . Lastly , cavins can complex at the plasma membrane even in the absence of caveolin 430 . Thus , the exact role of cavins alongside caveolin remains a complicated puzzle so far unsolved . Four additional proteins are well - founded as bona fide caveolar components : actin , dynamin , EHD2 and pacsin 2 ( Figure 1 . 8 ) 341 , 397 , 399 ( p2 ) , 429 , 431 , 432 . However , the precise interplay between these proteins as well as their role during caveolae coat formation ( and internalization ) remains unclear as of yet . Fluorescent - phalloidin staining of cells has revealed F - actin puncta at caveolar - like structures 433 . Furthermore , proper caveolae dynamics , such as their intracellular transport of cargo , appears to depend on actin , and more precisely , the actin crosslinker filamin A 434 – 436 . Curiously , stable arrest of caveolae at the plasma membrane also depends on filamin A 434 , 437 . The exact role of actin at caveolae is further complicated by the fact that EHD2 , a dynamin - like ATPase , is a negative regulator of caveolae internalization 399 , 438 . The exact mechanism behind the EHD2 - mediated restriction is unknown . In 2013 , Ludwig and colleagues set out to define the composition and ultrastructure of the caveolar coat 429 . Like dynamin , EHD2 localizes to the neck - like stalk of caveolae , but itself is excluded and dispensable for caveolin - cavin coat complex formation 429 . Pacsin 2 is another key regulator of caveolae formation as in cells depleted of pacsin 2 , caveolae are depleted and caveolin proteins accumulate in the membrane 397 . However , like EHD2 , pacsin 2 is excluded from the caveolar coat complex 429 ; consequently , the exact mechanism governing EHD2 - and pacsin 2 - mediated caveolae formation remains vague . As we have seen , caveolae were first characterized as plasma membrane vesicles 405 . In light of this , to what degree are caveolae genuinely utilized by the cell to internalize cargo ? Early GFP - Cav1 overexpression studies suggested that caveolae were , in fact , static structures when compared to the highly motile clathrin coated pits 439 , 440 . Contrary to this , Pelkmans and Zerial later reported on two dynamically distinct pools of caveolae , 1 ) a more immobile pool as described in earlier reports , and importantly , 2 ) a highly dynamic pool which maintained their caveolar coat during continuous cycles of fusion and fission 21 at the plasma membrane 441 . Using genome editing techniques , Shvets and colleagues revealed that only a small percentage ( ~ 5 % ) of caveolae undergo endocytosis 442 . To make matters more difficult , very few bona fide caveolar ligands exist in the literature 443 – 445 , 446 ( p ) , 447 – 449 . Be that as it may , strong evidence for caveolin - mediated intracellular cargo transport does exist in transcytosis of endothelial cells 211 , 326 , 408 , 450 – 455 . As we will see in chapter 1 . 6 . 4 , several pathogens also utilize caveolin - mediated endocytosis for their entry into cells 339 , 340 , 342 – 344 , 456 . If the cell sparsely utilizes caveolae to internalize cargo , what are its other functions ? Several studies support a role for caveolae as signalling platforms 326 , 457 – 467 . Of particular interest is the idea that caveolae can function as a guard against cell rupture due to plasma membrane stretching . In their examination of frog sarcomeres , Dulhunty and Franzini - Armstrong proposed that caveolae could serve as a reservoir of membrane , and that upon tension events , such as sarcomere stretching , collapse back into the plasma membrane 468 . In 2011 , Sinha and colleagues demonstrated flattening of caveolae back into the plasma membrane in response to mechanical stress experienced by the cell 403 . In a series of simple yet elegant experiments , Sinha et al . incubated cells in a hypo - osmotic medium leading to their swelling . Using a combination of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) and electron microscopy they demonstrated a significant 50 % reduction in the number of caveolae following exposure of cells to the hypo - osmotic medium 403 . Importantly , this mechanoprotective role for caveolae has also been demonstrated in vivo 469 , 470 . 1 . 6 . 3 . F - actin during endocytosis The Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization machinery is among the vast array of endocytic components which controls the invagination process during clathrin - and caveolin - mediated endocytosis 95 , 96 . However , initial invagination formation by the endocytic machinery does not appear to depend on actin filament polymerization 6 . Rather , the Arp2 / 3 complex comes into play at later stages when the invagination needs to be pushed away from the plasma membrane prior to vesicle scission ( Figure 1 . 9 ) 6 , 99 . One set of models for this places actin filament barbed ends that are pointed towards the plasma membrane . As the growing filament pushes against the membrane , the other end , attached to the budding vesicle , pushes the invagination deeper into the cell 6 , 329 ( Figure 1 . 9 ) . Another model involves the use of type I myosins pulling on the actin filaments to 22 drive the invagination inwards ( Figure 1 . 9 ) 6 , 8 . The experimental support for the role of F - actin during endocytosis comes from the observation of fewer endocytic cups ( or pits ) in cells treated with filamentous actin inhibitors such as latrunculin A 9 , 471 – 473 . In these studies , the few invaginations that were observed following drug treatment appear shallower and seemingly stalled at the plasma membrane . 1 . 7 . Listeria monocytogenes A great deal of our current understanding of eukaryotic cell biology ( and molecular biology ) takes its source from the study of bacteria . One of the most prominent of these bacteria is the human pathogen L . monocytogenes 106 , 474 – 479 . In this section , I will review L . monocytogenes , its prevalence amongst humans , an overview of its infectious cycle and the ways by which researchers study L . monocytogenes infections . In chapter 1 . 8 , I will provide extensive insight into the molecular mechanisms that are currently known which control the L . monocytogenes infectious cycle . 1 . 7 . 1 . L . monocytogenes – A relevant human pathogen In 1924 , bacteriologist E . G . D . Murray and colleague’s first isolated L . monocytogenes from infected rabbits and guinea pigs 480 . In this study , Murray et al . characterized L . monocytogenes , then a new species ( given the name Bacterium monocytogenes ) , as Gram - positive and rod - shaped . Following this , L . monocytogenes was recognised to cause meningitis and abortion in ruminants 481 – 485 . It wasn’t until much later that L . monocytogenes was accepted as a food - borne disease - causing agent in both animals and humans 481 , 484 , 486 – 488 . Compared to other well - known human pathogens , the number of L . monocytogenes infections worldwide is low ( ~ 23 , 000 in 2010 ) 488 , 489 . However , based off of reports from within North America , comparisons to other food - borne pathogens show that the mortality rate of L . monocytogenes infected individuals is high ( ~ 20 - 30 % ) ; thus , even to this day , L . monocytogenes remains a genuine cause for concern in humans 488 . During high titre ( 10 9 bacteria ) human infections , immunocompetent adults generally show symptoms of gastroenteritis 490 . In contrast to this , low dose infections ( ~ 10 2 - 10 4 ) of children , elderly , immunocompromised and pregnant women show much greater symptom severity as they are at risk for sepsis , meningitis , fetal infection and miscarriage 488 . L . monocytogenes is also a matter of grave concern for the food industry 23 as it can survive ( and propagate ) in conditions of low temperature ( and pH ) as well as high salt concentrations 487 , 488 , 491 . Following ingestion of contaminated food products , L . monocytogenes bacteria primarily target and invade into the host intestinal epithelia . Once inside cells , L . monocytogenes become motile and spread laterally within the epithelia or below into the lamina propria . In the lamina propria , L . monocytogenes can enter the lymph , and then bloodstream , where it can eventually target other organs such as the liver and spleen 475 . L . monocytogenes can also target the central nervous system by crossing the blood - brain barrier 492 . Resolution of infections can be achieved by administration of β - lactam or aminoglycoside antibiotics 486 . 1 . 7 . 2 . The intracellular lifecycle of L . monocytogenes Figure 1 . 10 depicts the intracellular lifecycle of L . monocytogenes during infection of mammalian cells . Over the past 30 years , microscopic examination of cell culture infections has been the key tool in elucidating each of the various stages of L . monocytogenes infection 493 . Validation using in vivo infection models and various molecular biology techniques has also proven to be indispensable 52 , 105 , 107 , 494 , 495 . L . monocytogenes can invade both phagocytic and non - phagocytic cells 478 , 493 , 496 – 505 . Phagocytes such macrophages utilize phagocytosis to internalize the bacteria 506 – 508 . To gain access to the intracellular environment of non - phagocytic cells , such as the intestinal epithelia , L . monocytogenes co - opts both the host receptor - mediated endocytic machinery and actin cytoskeleton 338 , 347 , 348 , 478 , 493 . Specifically , L . monocytogenes express on their cell surface two major effector proteins , Internalin A ( InlA ) and B ( InlB ) 478 , 497 , 509 . Interaction of InlA and / or InlB with their corresponding host cell receptor proteins triggers clathrin recruitment and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements at the bacteria - cell contact site ( Figure 1 . 11 ) 338 , 347 , 348 , 510 . Rapidly following this , actin polymerization pushes the plasma membrane up and over the attached bacteria in a process termed “zippering” internalization 338 , 510 . Once internalized , and only for a short period of time , the L . monocytogenes bacteria remain within a vacuole 493 . In order to rupture the vacuole and escape into the host cell cytosol , L . monocytogenes release several pore - forming effectors 511 – 514 . In other cell types , L . monocytogenes have been demonstrated to remain inside of vacuoles to propagate infection 515 . For example , in macrophages L . monocytogenes can remain inside and replicate within compartments termed spacious Listeria - containing phagosomes ( SLAPs ) 516 . Inside intestinal goblet cells , L . monocytogenes has been 24 shown to remain inside vacuoles which then transcytose the bacteria directly into the lamina propria 517 . The next step for bacteria that have gained access to the host cytosol is their replication and then actin - based motility 493 . In order to become motile , L . monocytogenes preferentially express at one of their poles the surface protein ActA 518 , 519 . Using ActA , the bacteria recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 - based actin polymerization machinery 52 , 105 , 520 . Polymerization of actin filaments at one pole of the bacteria generates a slender structure commonly referred to as a comet ( or rocket ) tail ( Figure 1 . 12 ) 474 , 479 , 493 , 520 , 521 . These actin - rich comet tails propel the bacteria within the host cytosol . Importantly , when these structures reach the plasma membrane , they deform it around the comet tail into a finger - like structure called a membrane protrusion 115 , 476 , 493 . Projection of the bacterial - containing membrane protrusion into adjacent host cells allows for the direct cell - to - cell transfer of the bacteria . Once inside the newly infected host cell , the bacteria reside within a double - membraned vacuole which is also broken down by bacterial pore forming effectors , thus freeing the bacteria into cytosol so as to propagate further infection 477 , 493 . 1 . 7 . 3 . Models of L . monocytogenes infection In vivo models Infections of mice represent the most commonly used in vivo small animal model of listeriosis . Intravenous ( i . v . ) inoculation of the mice is widely utilized by researchers given its high level of reproducibility ( along with low variability ) of infection 522 . Importantly , compared to the oral route , the LD 50 for i . v . inoculation is low ( ~ 10 4 - 10 6 bacteria ) 522 , 523 . The precise route of inoculation is direct injection into the lateral tail vein . During these infections , bacteria reach can reach the spleen or liver within 10 - 15 minutes 524 – 526 . It isn’t until 24 - 48 hours post i . v . inoculation when bacteria are detected in the gut . Interestingly , mouse infected via the i . v . route generally do not show bacterial dissemination to the brain 527 . Oral transmission of L . monocytogenes usually occurs via the use of contaminated food . One major pitfall of the oral route is that it requires an infectious dose that is generally multiple fold greater than that used during i . v . inoculations . One reason for this lies in the discovery of a single point mutation in the murine receptor of InlA , E - cadherin , which caused limited infection of the mice 528 . To combat this , researchers have developed both 25 mouse - adapted ( murinized ) bacteria 529 and transgenic humanized mice 530 , 531 . Importantly , these transgenic tools have demonstrated increased infection in the mouse intestine 530 , 531 . Interestingly , a recent developed infection model using wild - type mice and bacteria deleted for the InlA gene has been demonstrated to establish gut colonization without the risk of rapid systemic infection that is commonly caused using conventional oral infection models 532 . This new model also causes brain infection within a week 532 . Gerbils represent another relevant animal model to study infection by L . monocytogenes 530 , 533 . In fact , gerbils are a natural host of the bacteria , and are fatally susceptible to listeriosis 530 . Disson and colleagues’ investigation of gerbils revealed that , unlike mice , gerbils do not have a species barrier for infection via the InlA - or InlB - mediated invasion process 530 . Specifically , gerbil intestinal epithelial cells co - express E - cadherin and Met 530 . Consequently , both isogenic L . monocytogenes mutants (  inlA and  inlB ) , can infect cells to a high degree 530 . Importantly , oral inoculation of gerbils results in successful bacterial crossing of the intestinal barrier 530 . Gerbils are also permissive to fetoplacental infection following oral inoculation with wild - type L . monocytogenes bacteria 530 . Although gerbils appear an easier model to study infections by L . monocytogenes , the lack of gerbil specific reagents , such as primary antibodies , limits their potential usefulness to researchers . In vitro models In spite of their physiological relevance , animal model infections are expensive , laborious and require extensive training ; thus , the exploitation of cells in culture represent a quick and easy method to observe ( and study ) infection . Many immortalized cell lines are susceptible to infection by L . monocytogenes , and in conjunction with various microscopic imaging techniques , all of the intracellular stages of infection can also be visualized 249 , 338 , 347 , 493 , 497 – 500 , 534 . The combination of gene silencing ( or chemical inhibitors ) with various microbiological techniques , such as gentamicin protection assays , plaque assays and foci assays , provides an extremely useful way for researchers to identify crucial host and bacterial components of infection 114 , 249 , 494 , 515 , 534 – 540 . Thus , following the in vitro identification of a crucial host ( or bacterial ) factor of infection , researchers can then shift towards the use of animal models to ascertain that factors physiological relevance . 26 1 . 8 . Molecular mechanisms controlling L . monocytogenes receptor - mediated endocytosis and actin - based motility As mentioned earlier , L . monocytogenes express on their cell surface ( as well as secrete ) a variety of effector proteins that influence their ability to initially infect host cells , and once inside them , to gain motility to spread amongst them . Following ~ 30 years of dedicated study to these effectors , we now know many of their specific host cell targets . In this section , I will review the molecular mechanisms underlying these host - pathogen interactions as well as the various actin - based structures that L . monocytogenes generate as a result of them . 1 . 8 . 1 . Cellular invasion L . monocytogenes actively invades various non - phagocytic cells both in vivo and in cell culture 478 . To accomplish this , L . monocytogenes express on their cell surface two members of the internalin family of proteins , InlA and InlB 478 , 497 , 541 – 543 . Although the initial signalling cascades during bacterial internalization differ for both effector proteins , both ultimately end in the activation of clathrin - and Arp2 / 3 - mediated machineries at the bacteria - host contact site ( Figure 1 . 11 ) 347 , 478 , 544 . InlA - mediated invasion The host adhesion molecule , E - cadherin , is the cellular receptor of InlA 542 . E - cadherin is involved in adherens junction formation in various tissues such as the intestinal epithelial , placenta and blood - brain barrier 545 , 546 . In the host intestine , a process known as cell extrusion sheds old epithelial cells at the tips of villi 547 . Importantly , L . monocytogenes hijacks this process as E - cadherin molecules are exposed in the neighboring cells during cell shedding 548 . In addition to this internalization mechanism , L . monocytogenes bacteria can simply interact with E - cadherin molecules that are expressed on the apical surface of host epithelial cells 549 . Historically , L . monocytogenes bacteria often did not display invasion of mouse cell culture models 528 . Molecular examination of E - cadherin revealed a proline residue at position of 16 which was crucial for invasion of human , gerbil , or guinea pig cells but not mice or rats 528 . Further investigations showed the amino acid glutamic acid in place of proline at 27 position 16 of mouse ( and rat ) E - cadherin and this mutation precluded InlA recognition and subsequent invasion by L . monocytogenes 528 . The successful generation of a transgenic mice line expressing a humanized version of E - cadherin facilitated infection of the animal gut 531 . As mentioned earlier , researchers have also generated a L . monocytogenes strain which expresses a murinized form InlA ( Inl m ) , thus providing another means by which to study in vivo mouse gut infections . InlA - E - cadherin interactions result in receptor clustering at the bacteria - host contact site , and importantly , activation of E - cadherin by two post - translational modifications 550 . Specifically , the host kinase Src catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of E - cadherin whereas ubiquitination occurs via the host ubiquitin - ligase Hakai 550 . Importantly , E - cadherin activation is required for the subsequent recruitment of the clathrin endocytic machinery as well as dynamic actin cytoskeletal remodelling ( see below ) during bacterial invasion 550 . InlB - mediated invasion InlB facilitates L . monocytogenes invasion into various cell culture lines , and importantly , in the absence ( or proper expression ) of E - cadherin by the host 478 , 497 – 500 , 541 . Thus , the use of cell lines such as HeLa , CHO , HepG2 and Vero allows researchers to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms behind the InlB - mediated invasion process without interference by InlA 478 . The major cellular receptor of InlB is the hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( HGFR ) Met 543 . Functionally , therefore , InlB mimics HGF , the natural ligand of Met 551 – 553 . The InlB - mediated invasion process also shows species tropism as InlB binding to Met occurs only within humans , mice and gerbils 554 . The rabbit and guinea pig Met receptors do not respond to InlB 554 . Like the InlA - mediated process , post translational modification of Met following bacterial adhesion triggers clathrin and actin recruitment to the bacteria - host contact site 338 , 347 , 348 . Rather than hijacking the host kinase Src , Met is autophosphorylated 347 , 478 . Met autophosphorylation then triggers recruitment of the host ubiquitin ligase , Cbl , which in turn ubiquitinates Met 347 . Clathrin and actin during bacterial invasion 28 The host clathrin endocytic machinery is crucial for L . monocytogenes entry into cells 347 . Clathrin itself , and its accessory proteins such as dynamin and Dab2 are recruited to bacteria - host contact sites following receptor activation 347 . Using siRNA , Veiga and colleagues demonstrated a crucial role for clathrin endocytic components as in cells depleted of clathrin , Eps15 , dynamin , Grb2 , Hrs or CD2AP , bacterial invasion is significantly perturbed 347 . Dynamin - mediated recruitment of cortactin , a potent Arp2 / 3 complex activator , eventually triggers actin cytoskeletal rearrangements beneath the site of bacteria - host contact 347 . Additionally , the clathrin - associated protein Hip1R as well as myosin VI , serve as linkage between clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton 348 . Other actin - associated factors such as the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 also augment Arp2 / 3 complex activation during bacterial internalization events 478 , 544 , 555 – 557 . These factors depend on the generation of phosphoinositide’s such as PIP2 and PIP3 at the bacterial contact site as in cells treated with PI 3 - kinase inhibitors , such as wortmannin or LY294002 , bacterial internalization levels are decreased 558 . Normal actin polymerization dynamics such as F - actin elongation and depolymerization are also important for L . monocytogenes entry into cells as shown by inhibition studies involving VASP and ADF / cofilin 556 , 559 . Actin polymerization against the plasma membrane eventually engulfs the attached bacteria in a “zipper - like” fashion 478 , 560 . Interestingly , components of the host exocytic machinery have recently been highlighted to promote bacterial entry into cells 561 . Furthermore , septin proteins , which can assemble into filaments , have been described to promote the L . monocytogenes internalization process 540 , 562 . Besides InlA and InlB , Ghosh and colleagues recently characterized InlF as a crucial factor for the intermediate filament - mediated entry of L . monocytogenes into the brain 563 . 1 . 8 . 2 . Vacuolar escape Following the internalin - mediated invasion process , L . monocytogenes bacteria reside within a vacuole 493 . This represents only a short period of the infectious process as L . monocytogenes lyse the vacuole within ~ 30 minutes 564 , 565 . To rupture and escape the vacuole , L . monocytogenes bacteria secrete the pore - forming toxin listeriolysin O ( LLO ) 511 . Infection studies using a mutant strain of L . monocytogenes that does not express LLO shows the bacteria trapped within vacuoles following their invasion into the host cell 512 . L . monocytogenes also secrete two additional vacuole breaking enzymes , phospholipase A and B , whose expression is essential following initial invasion as well as 29 cell - to - cell spreading events when the bacteria reside within double - membraned vacuoles 478 , 481 , 513 , 514 , 566 , 567 . Escape into the host cytosol allows L . monocytogenes bacteria to replicate prior to their actin - based motility . However , as mentioned above , L . monocytogenes also exploit these vacuoles to gain access to the basement membrane of the intestinal epithelia , or in macrophages , as an additional habitat to replicate within 475 , 517 . Recent findings by Kortebi and colleagues also demonstrates a persistent population of L . monocytogenes bacteria residing within vacuoles following multi - day cell culture infections 515 . In this study , intercellular spreading bacteria were observed to downregulate ActA expression , and instead , enter a slow replicative state within Listeria - Containing Vacuoles ( LisCVs ) 515 . 1 . 8 . 3 . Actin - based motility – Comet / Rocket tail formation Arguably the most characteristic feature of the L . monocytogenes infectious cycle is the ability of the bacteria to commandeer the host Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization machinery for their intracellular motility 52 , 105 , 107 , 520 . This becomes evident when one examines actin - labelled host cells infected with the bacteria under the microscope . In these cells , one will observe slender and long actin enriched structures attached directly behind the bacterial cell 535 – 537 , 568 . These structures , commonly referred to as comet ( or rocket ) tails , provide the propulsive forces necessary to move the bacteria within the host cytosol ( Figure 1 . 12 ) 474 , 493 , 494 . When comet / rocket tails push the bacteria towards the host plasma membrane , the bacteria begin to generate an actin - rich membrane protrusion which eventually propels the bacteria directly into nearby cells 115 , 249 , 493 , 534 . In this section I will outline the major bacterial and host components that control comet / rocket tail growth and motility . L . monocytogenes ActA The major ( and sole ) determinant of comet / rocket tail formation is the L . monocytogenes effector protein ActA 67 , 518 , 569 – 572 . L . monocytogenes mutants that are deleted for the ActA gene ( actA ) can enter the host cytosol but do not recruit actin nor generate comet / rocket tails and thus are immotile 67 , 535 . Further support of this was shown through the covalent attachment of purified ActA onto small ( 0 . 5 - 2 µm ) polystyrene beads that when incubated in an actin - rich cytoplasmic extract , resulted in the formation of a motile comet / rocket tail at the surface of each bead 572 . 30 Structurally , L . monocytogenes ActA contains three major domains . A relatively hydrophobic C - terminal region anchors ActA into the bacterial membrane 573 . The two remaining domains , exposed to the host cytosol , are involved in the bacterial actin - based motility mechanism 67 , 573 . An N - terminal acidic domain followed by a central proline - rich region activate and regulate Arp2 / 3 activity at the bacterial cell surface 105 , 574 , 575 . The N - terminal domain directly binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex as well as G - actin 105 . Crucially , the N - terminal domain functions as a bona fide NPF / activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and thus , by itself is sufficient to induce motility 575 . In fact , it was the ground - breaking study by Welch and colleagues which demonstrated L . monocytogenes ActA as the first activator of Arp2 / 3 52 . When purified Arp2 / 3 was incubated with fluorescently - tagged actin and L . monocytogenes bacteria , actin filaments accumulated as a “cloud” around individual bacterial cells 52 . On rare instances , short comet tails were observed in preparations using the purified Arp2 / 3 52 . Structurally , the N - terminal region of ActA possess sequence similarly to the host NPF N - WASp 573 . The central proline - rich region of ActA is dispensable for bacterial motility 573 . Functionally , this region of ActA binds to VASP and likely makes actin - based motility efficient 573 , 576 . VASP binding to profilin could function to accelerate filament elongation of the comet / rocket tail 219 , 573 . Alternatively , VASP could stabilize actin filaments within the growing comet / rocket tail via its actin - bundling activity 219 . The L . monocytogenes actin comet / rocket tail Once inside the host cell cytosol , L . monocytogenes bacteria upregulate ActA expression 570 . Following successive rounds of replication , ActA becomes highly expressed at one pole of the bacterial cell 518 , 519 . In fact , this asymmetrical distribution of ActA is essential for unidirectional actin - based motility as biomimetic studies show defective ActA - coated bead motility when the ActA molecules are attached symmetrically about the bead 572 . Arp2 / 3 complexes that are recruited and activated at the bacterial cell surface ultimately generate a long slender branched actin - containing comet / rocket tail ( Figure 1 . 12 ) 52 , 105 , 474 , 520 . However , despite high levels of Arp2 / 3 within the structures , the comet / rocket tail also contains some long unbranched actin filaments 113 , 114 . Overall , the L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tail , like the eukaryotic lamellipodium and filopodium , depends on the cooperative efforts of an assortment of host proteins for its proper 31 formation and function 474 , 479 , 520 , 573 . Several actin - associated proteins normally involved in the “treadmilling” model of actin polymerization are recruited to comet / rocket tails . These proteins : profilin , ADF / cofilin , the capping protein CapZ , and VASP , are suggested to enhance overall motility rates ( Figure 1 . 12 ) 474 , 479 , 520 . Various F - actin crosslinkers and bundlers have also been immunolocalized to comet / rocket tails , including  - actinin , nexilin , fascin , fimbrin , filamin , and SM22 ( Figure 1 . 12 ) 114 , 115 , 535 , 536 . Inhibition of these proteins results in diverse phenotypic differences such as shorter , slower or even twisted comet tails 114 , 535 , 536 , 577 , 578 . These findings highlight the necessity for a certain degree of stiffness and stability within the structures which is endowed by these F - actin crosslinkers / bundlers 113 . Interestingly , the clathrin coated pit scission protein , dynamin2 , possess actin bundling and nucleating activity 579 . Experiments by Lee and De Camilli uncovered dynamin2 as another crucial component of the comet / rocket tail 579 . In cells expressing a mutant variant of dynamin2 , comets formation and motility rates are reduced 579 . Other host cytoskeletal elements , as well as other filament - forming proteins , are also hijacked by L . monocytogenes during their intracellular motility . Tubulin and the microtubule regulator stathmin have recently been immunolocalized to comet / rocket tails 580 . Depletion of stathmin results in comet / rocket tails that are longer , but oddly , move at slower rates 580 . Components of the spectrin cytoskeleton , such as spectrin and protein 4 . 1 , are recruited to the initial stages of comet / rocket tail formation , and in some instances even prior to actin cloud formation 537 . Interestingly , once comet / rocket tails have formed and elongated in length , these spectrin components appear to shed from the structures 537 . The septin family of proteins are a group of GTP - binding proteins that can oligomerize into filaments 581 . Mostowy and colleagues have demonstrated that SEPT2 and SEPT9 can polymerize into ring - like arrays at comet / rocket tails and around the bacterial cell body ; however , motility rates are not altered in the absence of these proteins 582 . ActA - mediated autophagy avoidance The L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tail is vital for the eventual cell - to - cell spreading of bacteria in vivo as well as during cell culture infections 493 . However , another crucial role for the actin - based motility of L . monocytogenes bacteria is autophagy avoidance 583 , 584 . Autophagy targets defective proteins , damaged organelles as well as bacteria for degradation and thus represents a crucial intracellular mechanism to facilitate 32 immunological function 585 . Yoshikawa and colleagues reveal that ActA - mediated recruitment of the host actin polymerization machinery to the bacterial cell surface functions as a way to cloak the bacteria ( and its surface proteins ) from autophagic recognition 583 , 584 . L . monocytogenes bacteria that express a mutant form of ActA that does not recruit the Arp2 / 3 complex , G - actin and VASP fail to avoid host cell autophagy programs 583 . 1 . 8 . 4 . Membrane protrusion formation As mentioned above , when motile L . monocytogenes bacteria reach the host plasma membrane , they often push against it , forming a finger - like protrusion that is sheathed by plasma membrane ( Figure 1 . 13 ) 493 . This membrane protrusion encloses the bacterial cell at its tip along with its attached actin - rich comet / rocket . The L . monocytogenes - containing membrane protrusion pushes directly into the surface of surrounding host cells ( Figure 1 . 14 ) 493 . The host cell receiving the projecting membrane protrusion generates a large endocytic - like invagination at its surface in order to engulf the structure . Whether or not the host endocytic machinery is at play during membrane protrusion engulfment remains a longstanding question in the field . Following membrane protrusion engulfment , the L . monocytogenes bacteria reside within a double - membraned vacuole which is eventually broken by secreted bacterial pore - forming toxins 477 . Once inside the cytosol of the newly infected host , the bacteria are once again free to generate the actin comet / rocket tail . Compared to the comet / rocket tail , few studies exist which examine the molecular mechanism underlying L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation . Two well - known host components which localize specifically to the membrane protrusion are ezrin and the formins 249 , 534 . Interestingly , certain comet / rocket tail proteins , such as α - actinin 1 , are shed immediately prior to membrane protrusion formation 115 . This interplay between protein recruitment and release at the membrane protrusion suggests a potential alteration to the underlying actin network contained with the structures . Indeed , ultrastructural examination of L . monocytogenes reveals long parallel bundles of F - actin with gradually reduced branching of actin towards the base of the structures 113 , 115 , 539 . The presence of these parallel F - actin arrays can be strongly attributed to ezrin and formin proteins within the structures 249 , 534 . Depletion or inhibition of these proteins results in fewer and shorter membrane protrusion , and consequently , diminished bacterial cell - to - cell spreading 249 , 534 . 33 Closer examination of the membrane protrusions generated in cells depleted of ezrin shows that they are structurally perturbed 249 . These findings highlight a crucial role in the switch from branched actin to parallel F - actin arrays in addition to the linkage of these arrays directly to the plasma membrane . Two secreted bacterial factors are also well - established as promoting efficient bacterial dissemination , Internalin C ( InlC ) and Internalin P ( Inl ) 495 , 586 . Rajabian and colleagues demonstrate that Inl C binding to the host adaptor protein Tuba , inhibits normal N - WASp - Tuba interactions 586 . As N - WSAP and Tuba are normally involved in maintaining junction integrity , secretion of InlC results in apical junction tension switching from taut to slack 586 , 587 . Induction of slack apical junctions allows motile L . monocytogenes bacteria to easily deform the host plasma membrane during membrane protrusion formation 586 . In addition to spreading within a layer of cells , such as the intestinal epithelia , L . monocytogenes bacteria also target the basal face of cells ( perpendicular to the monolayer ) in order to gain access to the underlying tissue 495 . To accomplish this , L . monocytogenes bacteria rely on the secreted effector InlP 495 . Specifically , Faralla and colleagues demonstrated an InlP - mediated inhibition of the host junctional protein , afadin , thus leading to a reduction in overall monolayer tractional forces 495 . Faralla and colleagues go on to hypothesize that it is this ability of L . monocytogenes to disrupt cell - substrate interactions that promotes bacterial spread vertically into tissue , such as the fetal stroma , during infections of pregnant women 495 . Following membrane protrusion engulfment , the bacteria reside within double - membranous vacuoles . To escape this structure , L . monocytogenes secrete LLO along with phospholipases A and B 477 . However , recent advances in the field reveal a sub - population of L . monocytogenes bacteria that persistently remain within vacuoles following their cell - to - cell spreading 515 . 1 . 9 . Other relevant actin - hijacking pathogens As mentioned earlier in the introduction of this thesis , several other bacterial pathogens have evolved elegant mechanisms by which to subvert the host actin cytoskeleton during infections . In this section , I will review three members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of Gram - negative bacteria , EPEC , S . Typhimurium and S . 34 flexneri . These pathogens rely on a complex needle - like apparatus , called the Type 3 secretion system ( T3SS ) , to inject potent effector proteins into host cell and thus cause disease 588 – 591 . Additionally , like the L . monocytogenes ActA protein , these bacteria also express on their surface crucial effector proteins 591 , 592 . The T3SS , in conjunction with surface expressed effector proteins , allow each of these bacteria to exploit the actin cytoskeleton at various stages of their infection ( Figures 1 . 15 - 1 . 18 ) 588 – 592 . Furthermore , while there exists extensive literature describing the entire infectious cycle of these pathogens , for the purpose of this thesis , I will be focussing primarily on the actin - rich structures they generate and the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation . 1 . 9 . 1 . Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) During EPEC infections these bacteria remain extracellular but are firmly attached to the surface of the host cell 588 , 592 – 594 . The major mechanism by which EPEC tightly associate with the host surface is through their formation of actin - rich pedestals ( Figure 1 . 15 ) 592 , 595 . To accomplish this , EPEC induces actin filament polymerization against the cytosolic leaflet of the host plasma membrane at the site of bacteria - host contact 594 . The polymerization of actin filaments eventually distends the host membrane , raising the bacteria off the natural surface of the host , thus resulting in pedestal formation 588 , 592 ( Fig 1 . 15 ) . Importantly , EPEC pedestals are motile structures and thus allow the bacteria to “surf” atop the surface of the host cell and even spread onto the surface of other nearby cells 596 , 597 . Pedestal formation is initiated following the T3SS - mediated injection of the EPEC effector Tir , which then inserts itself into the host plasma membrane 593 . Tir is the natural ligand of another EPEC effector protein , intimin , which is expressed on the bacterial cell surface 593 . Clustering of Tir molecules and then their interaction with intimin results in the tight attachment of the bacteria to the host cell surface 593 . Recruitment of the host Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization machinery occurs following an assortment of phosphorylation events on Tir 108 – 110 , 598 . The major determinant of actin - rich pedestal formation is the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 474 by host tyrosine kinases such as Abl and c - Fyn 110 , 599 . This modified residue serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of another host protein , nck 110 . Nck recruitment ultimately recruits the host NPF , N - WASp , which in turn recruits and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex beneath the region of EPEC attachment 109 . The activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex generates the high branched network 35 of F - actin that ultimately induces pedestal formation . Other crucial host cell factors that promote proper pedestal formation include the Arp2 / 3 activating protein cortactin , as well as the F - actin bundling proteins calponin 1 , calponin 2 and SM22 536 , 600 , 601 . Recent findings also point towards a key role for the actin nucleator , mDia , in generating a source of short actin oligomers ( or seeds ) for the Arp2 / 3 complex during pedestal biogenesis 602 . Pedestal formation is further complicated by the discovery of a non - canonical role of host clathrin endocytic machinery components such as clathrin , dynamin 2 , CD2AP , epsin 1 , Eps15 and Hsc70 at the structures 338 , 568 ( p70 ) , 603 ( p15 ) . Interestingly , other host cytoskeletal elements such as intermediate filament proteins and spectrin proteins are also hijacked during pedestal generation and likely impart additional stability to the structures 537 . 1 . 9 . 2 . Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium S . Typhimurium cause their entry into the host cell by co - opting the Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization machinery 604 – 607 . Attachment of the bacteria to the host cell surface , followed immediately by the T3SS - mediated injection of an array of bacterial effectors into the host cytosol culminates in the formation of actin - rich membrane ruffles at the site of bacteria - host contact ( Figure 1 . 16 ) 604 , 605 , 607 . Ultimately , the actin - rich membrane ruffles engulf the attached bacteria into the host cytosol 604 , 605 , 607 . The bacterial effectors SopB , SopE , and SopE2 are the major determining factors for successful entry of S . Typhimurium into the host cell , as bacterial strains with all three effectors deleted fail to generate membrane ruffles , and consequently , are non - invasive 608 . Functionally , SopB is a lipid phosphatase and increases plasma membrane expression of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) , PIP2 and PIP3 604 , 607 . SopE and SopE2 activate the Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 609 – 611 . The generation of phosphoinositides as well as active Cdc42 and Rac1 at the bacteria - host contact site results in the recruitment of the WAVE regulatory complex ( a cellular NPF ) , which in turn , activates the Arp2 / 3 complex 604 , 607 . Arp2 / 3 ultimately drives the formation of actin filaments against the plasma membrane forming the characteristic membrane ruffle 604 , 605 , 607 . Interestingly , the formin protein , FHOD1 , has also been demonstrated to control membrane ruffle formation via SopB 612 . SopB - mediated production of phosphoinositides results in the recruitment and activation of the Rho GTPase , RhoA 607 , 613 . RhoA activation of the host kinase ROCK , in turn , leads to FHOD recruitment to the bacteria - host contact site 612 . FHOD likely generates a small actin platform for the Arp2 / 3 complex to bind to and 36 extend into a branched F - actin network 612 . Remarkably , however , bacterial invasion is not completely abolished in the absence of Arp2 / 3 613 . Hanisch and colleagues demonstrate that , via SopB , myosin II - mediated contractility induces efficient bacterial invasion 613 . Thus , myosin II represents an additional , Arp2 / 3 - independent , mode of bacterial entry . Interestingly , when cells are depleted of both Arp2 / 3 and myosin II , bacterial invasion is completely eliminated 613 . The bacterial effector SipA is another T3SS injected factor which augments bacterial entry 614 – 616 . In the host cell , SipA stabilizes actin filaments during membrane ruffle formation and prevents their disassembly by host factors such as ADF / cofilin 614 – 616 . However , S . Typhimurium SipA mutants display only a marginal reduction in internalization levels 614 . 1 . 9 . 3 . Shigella flexneri Invasion S . flexneri is an invasive pathogen that also relies on actin - rich plasma membrane ruffling for their entry into cells ( Figure 1 . 17 ) 617 , 618 . These bacteria inject an array of T3SS effectors which manipulate actin cytoskeletal rearrangements beneath the plasma membrane 619 – 624 . The injected effectors IpaB and IpaC form a pore within the host plasma membrane to allow efficient movement of bacterial effectors into the host cell cytosol 625 . IpaC also activates the Arp2 / 3 complex via Src kinase and the NPF , cortactin 626 , 627 . The injected effector IpgB1 augments membrane ruffle formation through its ability to activate Rac1 , whose downstream targets further activate Arp2 / 3 628 . Another injected effector , IpgD , also promotes membrane ruffling through an as of yet unclear mechanism that involves PIP2 hydrolysis 629 . Two other effectors , IpgB2 and IpaA , are also implicated during the bacterial invasion process through activation of the GTPase Rho 630 – 633 . Following invasion , rapid vacuolar lysis releases the bacteria into the host cytosol . Actin - based motility Like L . monocytogenes , S . flexneri uses Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization at their cell surface to generate a motile comet / rocket tail ( Figure 1 . 18 ) 106 , 107 , 634 . Movement of the bacteria towards the host cell surface results in the deformation of the plasma membrane around the actin tail into a membranous protrusion 106 , 635 , 636 . As seen with L . 37 monocytogenes , projection of the membrane protrusion facilitates the cell - to - cell movement of S . flexneri bacteria into neighbouring cells 637 . The major determinant for comet / rocket tail formation is the bacterial surface protein IcsA 634 , 638 . Unlike the L . monocytogenes effector ActA , IcsA is not a functional mimic of cellular NPFs , and thus S . flexneri motility requires the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex activator , N - WASp 634 , 638 – 640 . Rather , IcsA functionally mimics the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 , and upon its interaction with N - WASp at the bacterial surface , releases N - WASp from its autoinhibitory state 634 . N - WASp activation also relies on its phosphorylation by host tyrosine kinases such as Abl and Btk 641 , 642 . Additionally , recruitment of the host protein TOCA - 1 by another bacterial effector , VirB , is essential for activating N - WASp 643 . Eventually , recruitment and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex results in the generation of a branched actin - containing comet / rocket tail at one pole of the bacteria 106 , 634 . Several host proteins have been identified as crucial factors for membrane protrusion formation and engulfment by neighboring cells . The formin , Dia1 , localizes to the actin core of membrane protrusions 644 . In cells depleted of Dia1 , cell - to - cell spreading of the bacteria is significantly perturbed ; however , the precise role of Dia1 within the membrane protrusion remains to be understood 644 . Myosin X is another component of the S . flexneri membrane protrusion 645 . Functionally , myosin X likely stabilizes the structures , as in cells inhibited for myosin X , shorter and thicker membrane protrusions are observed 645 . Myosin X most likely links the actin of the comet / rocket tail to the host plasma membrane 645 . Effective cell - to - cell spreading also relies on the clathrin endocytic machinery ; Fukumatsu and colleagues’ demonstrated clathrin and epsin - 1 localization to the membrane invaginations induced during membrane protrusion engulfment 349 . 1 . 10 . Rationale and research hypotheses L . monocytogenes exploit the host actin cytoskeleton during their cellular invasion , intracellular motility and cell - to - cell movement . Importantly , in order to propagate disease , the bacteria must generate motile actin - rich comet / rocket tails and membranous protrusions to propel the bacteria within and amongst host cells respectively . Although the minimal host components necessary for comet / rocket tail formation have been known for ~ 20 years , many more host components at the structures likely remain uncharacterized . In comparison , the mechanism behind L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation 38 remains poorly understood . The Enterobacteriaceae actin - hijacking bacteria EPEC , S . Typhimurium and S . flexneri routinely commandeer many of the same host proteins as L . monocytogenes during their infectious cycle . Like L . monocytogenes , the precise mechanisms regulating the formation of their actin - rich structures is not yet clear . Support for this comes from a recent mass - spectrometry screen of EPEC pedestals conducted in our lab that uncovered many host proteins not yet characterized during bacterial infections 646 . From this screen , I selected two proteins , palladin and cyclophilin A to examine during infections by actin - hijacking bacteria . Because actin - hijacking pathogens often utilize the same host proteins during their infections , I hypothesize that palladin and cyclophilin A are important host factors for overall infection , as well as for the formation of bacterially - derived actin - rich structures generated by actin - hijacking pathogens . L . monocytogenes generate large actin - rich membrane protrusions in order to spread from one cell to another . One of the longstanding questions regarding the cell - to - cell spreading process of L . monocytogenes is whether or not engulfment of the membrane protrusion occurs passively or actively by the host receiving cell . Importantly , several microbial pathogens have been demonstrated to exploit host endocytic pathways such clathrin - or caveolin - mediated endocytosis during their cellular invasion or cell - to - cell spreading 338 – 340 , 342 – 345 , 347 – 349 , 647 – 652 . Because of this , I hypothesize that the cell - to - cell spreading process of L . monocytogenes , and more specifically , the host cell engulfment of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions , represents a large scale endocytic event . 39 1 . 11 .

The role of actin filaments during endocytic vesicle internalization Branched actin filaments are generated at the endocytic invagination via the Arp2 / 3 complex . Two models could be at play ( either separately or together ) during the internalization of the cargo - carrying vesicle . 1 ) Branched actin filaments are linked to the invagination at their pointed end directly to the endocytic coat . The opposite barbed end of these filaments is associated with the surface of the cell . The continued elongation of actin filaments at the plasma membrane results in the pushing of the actin - tethered vesicle inwards towards the cytosol ( red arrow ) . 2 ) Myosin interaction with the invagination and the actin cytoskeleton results in the myosin - mediated pulling of the budding vesicle ( blue arrow ) .

Abstract Palladin is an important component of motile actin - rich structures and nucleates branched actin filament arrays in vitro . Here we examine the role of palladin during Listeria monocytogenes infections in order to tease out novel functions of palladin . We show that palladin is co - opted by L . monocytogenes during its cellular entry and intracellular motility . Depletion of palladin resulted in shorter and misshapen comet tails , and when actin - or VASP - binding mutants of palladin were overexpressed in cells , comet tails disintegrated or became thinner . Comet tail thinning resulted in parallel actin bundles within the structures . To determine whether palladin could compensate for the Arp2 / 3 complex , we overexpressed palladin in cells treated with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK - 666 . In treated cells , bacterial motility could be initiated and maintained when levels of palladin were increased . To confirm these findings , we utilized a cell line depleted of multiple Arp2 / 3 complex subunits . Within these cells , L . monocytogenes failed to generate comet tails . When palladin was overexpressed in this Arp2 / 3 functionally null cell line , the ability of L . monocytogenes to generate comet tails was restored . Using purified protein components , we demonstrate that L . monocytogenes actin clouds and comet tails can be generated ( in a cell - free system ) by palladin in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Collectively , our results demonstrate that palladin can functionally replace the Arp2 / 3 complex during bacterial actin - based motility . 2 . 2 . Introduction The infectious cycle of the invasive and motile bacterium Listeria monocytogenes relies heavily on its ability to exploit the epithelial cell actin cytoskeleton . These bacteria require actin filaments for their uptake into epithelial cells 496 and for their formation of motile actin - rich structures generated within their host cells called comet tails 67 , 493 . During comet tail formation , L . monocytogenes recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to one of their poles through the N - WASP - mimicking bacterial protein , ActA 105 . This recruitment stimulates the force - generating , branched actin polymerization that is needed to propel L . monocytogenes within and amongst host cells , and functions at the molecular level similarly to lamellipodia in migrating eukaryotic cells 479 . 60 The actin - binding protein , palladin , is widely expressed in developing and adult vertebrate cells and tissues 201 , 202 , 655 . This multifunctional protein acts as a scaffolding protein by recruiting other actin - related proteins such as profilin 656 , VASP 205 , α - actinin 207 , ezrin 202 , PDLIM1 208 , Eps8 204 and LASP - 1 655 , to actin - rich structures within the cell . Palladin can directly crosslink actin filaments , an activity that has been linked to its Ig3 domain 186 , and can generate crosslinked actin filaments when pure preparations of palladin and monomeric actin are co - incubated in vitro 206 . In this study we explore the involvement of palladin during L . monocytogenes infections and simultaneously use L . monocytogenes infections as a model to study the functional roles of palladin . 2 . 3 . Results 2 . 3 . 1 . Palladin Localizes to L . monocytogenes Entry Sites and Actin - Rich Comet Tails , but not Listeriopods L . monocytogenes exploits the actin polymerization machinery at four distinct times : 1 ) for entry into cells , 2 ) as a cloud of F - actin surrounds immotile bacteria , 3 ) for intracellular motility and 4 ) for cell - to - cell spreading . When these microbes hijack the actin cytoskeleton they re - arrange it into dynamic morphological structures ( actin clouds , comet tails and listeriopods ) . To determine if palladin was recruited to these structures we infected HeLa cells with wild type L . monocytogenes and stained fixed cells for endogenous palladin . We found that palladin was recruited to bacterial entry sites , actin clouds and comet tails , but was absent from listeriopods ( Figure 2 . 1A ) . The altered localization of palladin in infected cells did not change its level of expression ( Figure 2 . 5 ) . Because these bacterially induced actin - based structures are highly dynamic , we sought to determine the recruitment characteristics of palladin in relation to actin . To do this we co - transfected Ptk2 cells with GFP - palladin and mKate - LifeAct and saw their simultaneous recruitment to actin clouds surrounding stationary bacteria as well as at motile comet tails ( Movie 2 . 1 ) . When comet tails pushed motile bacteria into the plasma membrane to initiate listeriopod formation , overall palladin intensity decreased to general cytoplasmic levels except at regions close to the bacteria - actin interface that continued to show increased palladin recruitment ( Movie 2 . 2 ) . 61 2 . 3 . 2 . Palladin Is Required for the Proper Formation and Motility of Comet Tails To investigate the importance of palladin during comet tail formation , we depleted palladin in HeLa cells using siRNA and then infected the cells with L . monocytogenes ( Figures 2 . 1B and 2 . 1E ) . We found no significant effects on bacterial invasion in cells with undetectable levels of palladin compared to control siRNA treated cells ( Fig 2 . 6A ) . Because bacteria could still invade host cells , we examined the morphology of comet tails in palladin - depleted cells and discovered that comet tails were significantly shorter in length compared to those in control siRNA treated cells ( Figure 2 . 1C ) . Actin staining also showed that in palladin - depleted cells , comet tails were distorted compared to their straighter counterparts in control cells ( Figures 2 . 1E - F ) . We quantified this difference by measuring the ratio of the full comet tail length to the shortest distance between the bacteria - tail interface and end of the comet tail ( tortuosity index ) and confirmed that comet tails in palladin - depleted cells were severely tortuous ( Figure 2 . 1D ) , further supporting its role within the eukaryotic cytoskeleton as an important actin - crosslinking protein . Interestingly , listeriopods appeared unaltered in the absence of palladin ( Fig S2 . 6B ) . 2 . 3 . 3 . Palladin Mutants Dramatically Alter L . monocytogenes Motility and F - actin Organization within Comet Tails The actin and VASP binding domains of palladin are important for its normal functioning 187 , 209 . We examined the influence of those regions on L . monocytogenes infections by overexpressing domain mutants of palladin that acted in dominant negative fashions ( Figure 2 . 2A ) . The actin binding ability of palladin has been tied to three key lysine residues ( K15 , K18 and K51 ) within its C - terminally located Ig3 domain ( Figure 2 . 2A ) . When a palladin variant mutated at these residues ( palladinK15 / 18 / 51A ) is expressed in cells , abnormal nuclear localization of palladin and extensive cytoskeletal perturbations in cultured epithelial cells are evident 187 . We co - transfected GFP - palladinK15 / 18 / 51A ( actin - binding mutant ) together with mKate - LifeAct into HeLa cells and viewed , via time – lapse imaging , motile bacteria during L . monocytogenes infections . We used the known nuclear localization of GFP - palladinK15 / 18 / 51A as a readout of cells that had functionally perturbed palladin and found that motile comet tails disintegrated at their distal ends , leaving behind a trail of 62 comet tail debris ( Figure 2 . 2B and Movie 2 . 3 ) . The crumbling comet tails moved at rates approximately two - fold slower than comet tails in cells overexpressing GFP - tagged wild - type palladin ( Figure 2 . 2C ) . The actin - associated protein VASP classically localizes to the surface of L . monocytogenes through direct interactions with the bacterial protein ActA ; however , it is also present throughout the entire comet tail ( Figure 2 . 2D ) . To assess the requirement of ActA expression on palladin recruitment to the bacterial surface , we utilized bacteria deleted in actA . Not surprisingly , palladin was unable to be redistributed to the surface of these mutant bacteria ( Figure 2 . 7 ) . Due to the importance of VASP during L . monocytogenes motility 219 , 221 , 657 , 658 and its association with palladin at actin - rich structures within the cell 209 , we examined the functional role of palladin - VASP interactions during L . monocytogenes infections by using a GFP - tagged palladin construct mutated in its VASP - binding polyproline motif ( GFP - palladinFPAA ) . We found dramatic alterations to the actin cytoskeleton in GFP - palladinFPAA expressing cells . In these cells , abnormal cytoplasmic clumps and bar - like structures were generated that were enriched with actin and VASP ( Figures 2 . 8A - B ) . We could not identify these unusual structures in either GFP - palladin or GFP - palladinK15 / 18 / 51A expressing cells ( Figure 2 . 8A ) . We used these abnormal actin - rich formations together with GFP as convenient markers for cells that were successfully transfected with GFP - palladinFPAA . When actin clouds were examined during live infections , the filamentous actin appeared notably diffuse around non - motile bacteria ( Figure 2 . 2B and Movie 2 . 4 ) . Strikingly , when comet tails were viewed , they became progressively thinner as they moved ( Figure 2 . 2B and Movie 2 . 4 ) . The thin comet tails also remained tethered to remnants of diffuse actin clouds that had stayed behind in their original location surrounding the L . monocytogenes bacteria prior to their launch into dynamic motility ( Figure 2 . 2B and Movie 2 . 4 ) . We also found that endogenous VASP was redistributed away from comet tails in GFP - palladinFPAA expressing cells ; however , its recruitment to the surface of bacteria remained unaltered ( Figure 2 . 2D ) . Motility rates of bacteria in GFP - palladinFPAA expressing cells decreased by 4 - fold as compared to GFP - palladin overexpressing cells ( Figure 2 . 2C ) . To gain further insight into the thinning events occurring at comet tails we used transmission electron microscopy . Comet tails normally exploit the Arp2 / 3 complex to generate a branched actin filament network . We found that the arrangement of F - actin throughout the thinned GFP - palladinFPAA comet tails contained parallel arrays of F - actin 63 whereas mock and GFP - palladin transfected cells did not ( Figures 2 . 2E - G′′ ) . Collectively , these findings show that the actin - binding and scaffolding roles of palladin are crucial for the proper formation and organization of branched actin filament arrays within comet tails . 2 . 3 . 4 . Palladin Compensates for the Arp2 / 3 Complex during L . monocytogenes Actin - Based Motility We have recently shown that palladin can generate actin filaments in vitro 206 . Based on these findings we investigated whether palladin’s apparent actin - nucleating ability could be exploited by L . monocytogenes to maintain its motility if the Arp2 / 3 complex was functionally defective . To do this we examined the motility of L . monocytogenes in cells overexpressing GFP - palladin , GFP - palladinK15 / 18 / 51A or GFP - palladinFPAA prior to ( and following ) perfusion of the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor , CK - 666 494 . A cessation of L . monocytogenes motility has already been demonstrated in infected cells treated with CK - 666 494 . We confirmed this by live - cell imaging L . monocytogenes infections of cells with endogenous levels of palladin and noticed an immediate disassembly of actin clouds and comet tails resulting in immotile bacteria when CK - 666 was introduced ( Figure 2 . 3A and Movie 2 . 5 ) . Remarkably , when GFP - palladin was overexpressed in cells , L . monocytogenes comet tails remained motile throughout treatment with CK - 666 ( Figure 2 . 3A and Movie 2 . 6 ) . Additionally , bacteria with actin clouds that were stationary prior to the addition of CK - 666 in GFP - palladin overexpressing cells were still able to generate comet tails and became motile in a manner indistinguishable from bacteria in untreated cells suggesting that exogenous palladin is not functioning solely as a stabilizer of pre - existing comet tails during treatment with CK - 666 ( Movie 2 . 7 ) . Bacterial motility was also evident in cells overexpressing GFP - palladinK15 / 18 / 51A or GFP - palladinFPAA ( actin - or VASP - binding palladin mutants ) after CK - 666 was introduced ( Figure 2 . 3A and Movies 2 . 8 and 2 . 9 ) albeit with the crumbling and thinning comet tail phenotypes described earlier . To gain further insight into this novel function of palladin , we tracked the speed of motile bacteria by time - lapse microscopy ( Figure 2 . 3B ) . Before the addition of CK - 666 , motile L . monocytogenes in cells with endogenous amounts of palladin moved at an average speed of 8 . 990 µm / min ( Figure 2 . 3C ) . Following CK - 666 treatment , bacterial speeds dropped significantly to an average of 0 . 279 µm / min ( Figure 2 . 3C ) . Although the majority of motile bacteria came to a complete stop after the introduction of CK - 666 , a fraction of the bacteria displayed a slow ( 1 . 281 µm / min ) , jerky - type of movement ( Figure 2 . 3B ) . Interestingly , L . 64 monocytogenes motility rates in CK - 666 treated cells overexpressing GFP - tagged wild type palladin were unaltered upon treatment with CK - 666 and displayed speeds similar to those of bacteria in wild type cells prior to the drug treatment ( Figure 2 . 3B - C ) . To further characterize this novel function of palladin , we set out to examine bacterial actin - based motility in cells depleted of the Arp2 / 3 complex . To do this , we utilized a recently established Arpc2 conditional knockout cell line 659 . In these cells , loss of the Arpc2 gene product ( p34 ) also caused the depletion of additional Arp2 / 3 complex subunits including Arp2 and Arp3 659 . A challenge in studying L . monocytogenes infections in Arpc2 - / - cells was that the bacteria could not invade the cells . To overcome this we pre - infected wild type cells with L . monocytogenes and then mixed the infected wild type cells with Arpc2 - / - cells expressing GFP - palladin or the GFP empty vector and allowed the infection to proceed for 16 hours ; ultimately resulting in the cell - to - cell spread of bacteria into Arpc2 - / - cells . As expected , bacteria within Arpc2 - / - cells expressing GFP alone were unable to generate F - actin at their surface and formed intracellular clusters ( Figure 2 . 4A ) . However , when Arpc2 - / - cells overexpressed GFP - palladin , L . monocytogenes generated actin - rich comet tails enriched with palladin ( Figure 2 . 4A ) , as was the case with wild type cells expressing GFP - palladin ( Figure 2 . 4A ) . To definitively establish that palladin can induce F - actin nucleation around bacteria as well as promote the formation and elongation of actin - rich comet tails in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we modified a previously developed cell free protein reconstitution assay 107 . This assay allows for the generation of actin clouds and comet tails in a cell free system when the bacteria are mixed together with purified components of the actin polymerization machinery that include the Arp2 / 3 complex , profilin , cofilin , gelsolin and F - actin . As expected , we were able to generate actin clouds and comet tails when the protein constituents contained all of the aforementioned components ( Figure 2 . 4B ) . To test if purified palladin could functionally replace the Arp2 / 3 complex , we substituted palladin for the Arp2 / 3 complex . We found that full - length palladin was capable of nucleating F - actin clouds around L . monocytogenes and could polymerize comet tails behind the bacteria ( Figure 2 . 4B ) . We also identified long thin palladin - generated comet tails tethered to clumps of actin ( Figure 2 . 9 ) . None of these structures were generated when the actin - binding domain of palladin ( Ig3 - palladin ) was used in place of full - length palladin ( Figure 2 . 4B ) . When a palladin variant mutated in its VASP - binding region ( palladinFPAA ) was used in place of the wild type full - length form , actin clouds and comet tails associated with 65 the bacteria failed to form ( Figure 2 . 10 ) . However , this mutant form of palladin did produce two populations of F - actin arrays , linear F - actin bundles and disorganized F - actin clumps ( Figure 2 . 10 ) that were reminiscent of the structures generated in cells overexpressing palladinFPAA ( Figure 2 . 2B ) . L . monocytogenes ActA augments the polymerization activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex 105 . Similarly , in vitro actin polymerization rates of reactions containing both Arp2 / 3 and ActA are enhanced when compared to reactions using Arp2 / 3 alone 105 . Using pyrene - actin polymerization assays we found that ActA also enhanced palladin’s ability to nucleate and polymerize actin ( Figure 2 . 4C ) . 2 . 4 . Discussion In summary , we have described several novel ways that palladin influences actin - rich structures generated during L . monocytogenes infections . When palladin is depleted from cells , comet tails have a tortuous morphology and a diminished length . When specific amino acids are altered , comet tails crumble and actin organization switches from branched networks to parallel arrays . Moreover , we show that palladin can functionally replace the Arp2 / 3 complex in infected cells as well as in a cell free system by promoting the actin - based motility of the bacteria . How does this protein mechanistically accomplish this ? The mutation of three lysine amino acids ( K15 / 18 / 51A ) in the Ig3 domain of palladin that causes crumbling comet tails has previously been shown to severely influence the crosslinking function of the protein , diminishing it to background levels 187 . Biochemical evidence has demonstrated that when bound to actin , palladin can also dimerize , which facilitates its crosslinking activity 188 . Thus , we postulate that crumbling comet tails may arise due to the diminished ability of palladin to bind actin . In turn , this would lower palladin’s ability to dimerize and thus crosslink actin filaments within the comet tail dendritic meshwork despite the known presence of other potent actin - crosslinkers such as α - actinin and fascin at the comet tails 114 , 578 . Although palladin is crucial for proper comet tail formation , whether its activity is also important during listeriopod formation will require further study . We show that palladin is shed from the actin of the listeriopods , suggesting that it likely has no role in bacterial cell - 66 to - cell spreading events . The altered distribution of actin - associated proteins that are present in comet tails , but are eliminated from listeriopods has also been reported for  - actinin 115 . Interestingly other proteins work in the reverse manner ; being recruited to listeriopods , but not comet tails 115 , 534 . The differences in actin - associated components are likely due to the morphological organization of the actin filaments within the structures as comet tails contain branched actin arrays and despite Arp2 / 3 being present at the bacterial actin interface within listeriopods , the majority of actin within those protrusions are organized in a parallel arrangement through formins 115 , 534 , 539 . The role of VASP during L . monocytogenes infections has been studied extensively at the bacterial surface where it directly binds to ActA and regulates L . monocytogenes motility rates 219 , 660 . However , VASP also localizes within the comet tail and here we show that an absence of VASP from comet tails in palladinFPAA - expressing cells dramatically influences the organization of actin filaments , changing them from branched arrays to parallel . In addition to the altered organization of F - actin within the comet tails , this mutant form of palladin also dramatically alters the cytoskeleton of the host cell itself as it generates actin - rich cytoplasmic clumps within the cell . Similar clumps were also generated in the cell - free reconstitution assays when palladinFPAA was used in place of wild - type palladin suggesting that either the lack of the VASP binding domain itself ( together with actin ) or unknown interactions of the other components in the assays with this palladin mutant are responsible for the observed clumping phenotype . Others have found that the absence of VASP from actin - rich structures increases F - actin branching 216 , which may be influencing the observed actin clumps . This would be counterintuitive to our observation of ‘parallel’ structures within the palladin FPAA comet tails . However , in those comet tails VASP remains at the bacterial surface while absent from the length of the comet tail . At the bacterial surface VASP could function by regulating the elongation of the actin filaments by binding to barbed filament ends associated with the bacterial surface in a process dependent on binding palladin . Our most significant discovery was the demonstration that palladin can functionally replace the Arp2 / 3 complex likely through its ability to nucleate and polymerize F - actin into actin clouds and motile comet tails . We also showed that ActA further enhanced palladin’s actin nucleating activity , but to a much lesser extent than that generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . The substantial disparity between Arp2 / 3 and palladin + ActA nucleation / polymerization activities suggests that another mechanism could be involved 67 during the generation of palladin - mediated actin comet tails . In addition to its known actin nucleating and crosslinking roles , palladin is efficient at stabilizing actin filaments 206 . Palladin also dimerizes upon actin binding 188 and this could further enhance both filament crosslinking and stabilization while also providing additional nucleation sites for actin . Thus , as an alternative strategy , palladin may use those properties to enhance its nucleating abilities at L . monocytogenes actin - rich structures . Because palladin and the Arp2 / 3 complex are abundant proteins in essentially all epithelial cells , it remains unclear to what extent the replacement of the Arp2 / 3 complex with palladin would actually occur during in vivo infections . Our evidence that palladin itself can nucleate and extend F - actin networks in the complete absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex is different from what has been shown previously with  - actinin and fascin as these proteins can only extend actin networks generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex but not nucleate them 114 . Because palladin levels are highly elevated at the motile leading edge of normal 205 and wounded cells 661 – 663 , as well as the fact that palladin is highly upregulated in motile cancer cells 664 – 667 , we propose a bona fide cellular function for the actin nucleation role of palladin in enhancing actin - based motility events within the cell . Overall , these findings could have broad implications for an array of cell biology 661 , 668 , tumor biology 203 , 664 – 667 and microbial pathogenesis 540 fields . 2 . 5 . Materials and Methods 2 . 5 . 1 . Cell Culture Human cervical ( HeLa ) and Potorous tridactylus kidney ( Ptk2 ) epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ( numbers CCL - 2 and CCL - 56 respectively ) . HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing high glucose ( Hyclone , GE Healthcare ) and were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Ptk2 cells were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 ( 1 : 1 ) ( Hyclone , GE Healthcare ) supplemented with 10 % FBS . Both cell lines were maintained in a cell culture incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO2 ) . To obtain Arpc2 - / - cells , the parental mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line designated 10 - 4 was treated with puromycin dihydrochloride ( Sigma ) and 4 - hydroxy - tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT , Sigma ) as described previously 659 . To seed cells for experiments , flasks or culture dishes with cells were washed 3X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline without Ca2 + and Mg2 + ( PBS 68 [ - / - ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , trypsinized with 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and seeded onto clear polystyrene 6 - well plates ( Corning ) containing glass coverslips . For electron microscopy experiments , flexible silicone elastomer membranes ( Flexcell International ) were used in place of glass coverslips . 2 . 5 . 2 . Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions The bacterial strains used were L . monocytogenes strains EGD BUG 600 and Δ actA ( Gifted by Dr . Pascale Cossart ) . All L . monocytogenes strains were grown at 37 °C using either brain heart infusion ( BHI ) agar or broth ( BD Biosciences ) . 2 . 5 . 3 . Listeria monocytogenes Infections To infect cultured cells , overnight shaken broth cultures of L . monocytogenes were diluted 10X in BHI broth and then incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator until A600 = 1 . 00 . Once cultures reached A600 = 1 . 00 , bacteria were spun down for 5 minutes at 10 , 000 rpm ( 25 °C ) and washed with PBS [ - / - ] . Pelleted bacteria were re - suspended with serum - free media then diluted 100X . Diluted bacteria were added onto culture plates containing host cells and incubated for 30 minutes to study bacterial internalization or at least 6 hours to study comet tails and listeriopod formation . To infect Arpc2 - / - cells , wild type cells were infected for 2 hours , collected from culture plates and overlaid onto culture plates containing uninfected Arpc2 - / - cells where the infection was allowed to proceed for an additional 14 - 18 hours . 2 . 5 . 4 .

Immunolocalization For immunofluorescence studies , cells were fixed at room temperature for 15 minutes using pre - warmed ( 37 ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde ( prepared in 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM Na / K PO 4 , 5 . 0 mM KCl , pH 7 . 3 ) and then washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] . Cells were permeabilized with room temperate 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 5 minutes and then washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] . Samples treated with mouse anti - palladin antibodies required permeabilization with −20 °C acetone for 10 minutes followed by air drying at room temperature for 30 minutes . All samples were then blocked with 5 % normal goat serum ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes after which samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies prepared in TPBS / BSA ( PBS [ - / - ] , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] ) . Following this , samples were washed 3X with TPBS / BSA for 10 minutes and then treated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) at room temperature for 2 hours . To visualize F - actin , samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 - , 488 - or 350 - conjugated phalloidin ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes . Samples were washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] and mounted onto glass microscope slides using Prolong Diamond antifade mountant containing DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . 2 . 5 . 6 . Lysate Preparation and Western Blotting Lysates were prepared by washing the samples 3X with pre - warmed PBS [ - / - ] and then treating the samples with ice - chilled RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid , 10 % SDS ) with cOmplete™ Mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) on ice for 5 minutes . Cells were disrupted using cell scrapers and lysates collected into microcentrifuge tubes . Lysates were spun at 4 °C and 10 , 000 g for 10 minutes to pellet cellular debris ; supernatants were collected into fresh microcentrifuge tubes and immediately stored at −80 °C . Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay kit ( Pierce ) . For 70 Western blotting , lysates samples were first prepared in 6X Laemmli buffer then boiled for 10 minutes . Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and subsequently resolved by electrophoresis . Following separation , gels were rinsed in water for 5 minutes and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot® SD semi - dry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . After the transfer , the membranes were washed for 5 minutes in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) , blocked with 4 % Blotto ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) prepared in TBST and then treated with primary antibodies ( diluted in TBST , 1 % BSA ) overnight at 4 °C . Membranes were washed 3X with TBST for 10 minutes each prior to incubating with secondary antibodies ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Membranes were treated with Western Lightning Plus - ECL ( PerkinElmer ) following the manufacturer’s instructions and visualized using a Fujifilm LAS - 4000 imager ( Fujifilm ) . To confirm equal loading , membranes were stripped of bound antibodies with mild stripping buffer ( 1 . 5 % glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 2 . 2 ) and re - probed using anti - actin or anti - calnexin targeting antibodies as outlined above . 2 . 5 . 7 . DNA Constructs All palladin constructs used consisted of the major 90 kDa isoform , commonly referred to as isoform # 4 . These included GFP vectors containing wildtype palladin , and the actin - binding mutant GFP - palladinK15 / 18 / 51A10 . GFP - palladinFPAA , the VASP - binding mutant construct , was generated from the phrGFPIIN - palladin ( human isoform # 4 ) construct . For vector controls , the phrGFPIIN vector ( Stratagene ) was utilized . The phenylalanine and proline residues found in the polyproline region of palladin were both mutated to alanine using site - directed mutagenesis with the following primers : 5’ - GTGCCCGACGTGGCCGCACTGCCGCCGCCACCA - 3’ and 5’ - TGGTGGCGGCGGCAGTGCGGCCACGTCGGGCAC - 3’ . Plasmids containing mKate - LifeAct or eGFP - LifeAct were a gift from Dr . Michael Davidson ( Addgene plasmid # 54697 and 54610 respectively ) . 2 . 5 . 8 . Microscopy and Live Cell Imaging Images were acquired using a Leica DMI4000B ( Leica Microsystems ) inverted fluorescent microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . All devices were controlled by MetaMorph Imaging System software 71 ( Universal Imaging ) . Images obtained were evaluated using Metamorph Imaging System software or ImageJ . For live cell imaging , a Chamlide IC top stage incubator system was used to maintain a constant temperature and environment of 37 °C and 5 % humidified CO2 gas in air . Bacterial motility rates and comet tails were analyzed using ImageJ . For CK - 666 studies , DMEM ( without phenol red ) + 10 % FBS containing 100 µM CK - 666 ( prepared in DMSO ) was perfused into magnetic coverslip - containing chambers ( Chamlide ) during the infections at indicated times . 2 . 5 . 9 . Cell Culture Transfections All DNA transfections of cultured cells were performed using jetPEI or jetPRIME transfection reagents ( Polyplus Transfection ) and were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cells were transfected and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 4 hours . Following this , media was replaced and cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C to allow the expression of the respective gene product . Transfected cells were either fixed for viewing by immunofluorescence microscopy or imaged live by time - lapse microscopy . 2 . 5 . 10 . Palladin RNAi Knockdown A smart pool ( ON - Targetplus siRNA ) of 4 palladin siRNA and 4 non - targeting control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon ( GE Healthcare ) . Transfections were performed using the siRNA transfection reagent INTERFERin ( Polyplus transfection ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , 0 . 1 mL of serum - free media containing 50 nM siRNA duplexes and INTERFERin was added to cells contained in clear polystyrene 24 well culture plates . To obtain cells with undetectable levels of palladin protein , cells required a 72 hour incubation period following the siRNA treatment . 2 . 5 . 11 . Electron Microscopy Media was replaced with fixative ( 1 . 5 % paraformaldehyde , 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , pH7 . 3 , rt ) , left for 2 - 3 hours , and then the fixative was replaced with buffer ( 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate , pH7 . 3 , rt ) . The membranes , with attached cells , were gently cut away from cell culture dishes and then further cut into 1 - 2 cm2 pieces . The pieces were placed in glass vials and then washed twice ( 10 minutes each wash ) with 72 fresh buffer . The samples were post - fixed for 1 hour on ice with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate ( pH 7 . 3 ) . The samples were washed three times ( 10 minutes each wash ) with ddH2O ( rt ) and then stained en bloc with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate ( rt ) . The membranes were again washed three times with ddH2O ( rt ) and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethyl alcohols ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 95 % , 2X100 % - 10 minutes each ) followed by two treatments with propylene oxide ( 15 minutes each ) . The samples were then placed in 1 : 1 propylene oxide : EMBED 812 resin ( Electron microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) and left overnight . The following day , the membranes were passed through two changes of 100 % EMBED 812 resin and then placed on glass slides with the cells face - up . Embedding capsules were filled with resin , inverted onto the membranes , and then the slides with membranes and embedding capsules placed in an oven ( 60 °C ) for the resin to polymerize for 48 hours . After polymerization , the capsules ( with embedded cells ) were carefully separated from the membranes that remained attached to the slides . The cell layers at the surfaces of the block were sectioned en face using a Leica ultramicrotome and collected onto copper grids . The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and then viewed and images collected using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Electron Microscope operated at 120 kV . 2 . 5 . 12 . Protein purification Full - length 90 - kDa human palladin was subcloned into the pTBSG expression vector to allow for expression of a His6 fusion protein . The construct was transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli cells ( NEB , Ipswich , MA ) and cells were grown at 37 °C until OD600 reached 0 . 6 in ZYM - 5052 auto - induction media . Cell cultures were pelleted down and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM sodium phosphate , 300 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , 10 % glycerol , pH 7 . 4 ) , followed by sonication and clearing of cell lysate by centrifugation . Supernatant was incubated with PROTEINDEXTM Ni - PentaTM agarose 6 Fast Flow ( Marvelgent Biosciences Inc . , Canton , MA ) slurry overnight at 4 °C before protein was purified according to manufacturer’s guidelines . The elution fraction was dialyzed into S - column buffer A ( 25 mM KH2PO4 , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , pH 6 . 5 ) before loading onto cation - exchange column on an ÄKTA FPLC ( GE Healthcare ) with a HiPrepTM SP XL column . The protein was eluted using a gradient with a target of 100 % buffer B ( 25 mM KH2PO4 , 1 M NaCl , 2 mM DTT , pH 6 . 5 ) .

Abstract Listeria monocytogenes move from one cell to another using actin - rich membrane protrusions that propel the bacteria toward neighboring cells . Despite cholesterol being required for this transfer process , the precise host internalization mechanism remains elusive . Here we show that caveolin endocytosis is key to this event as bacterial cell - to - cell transfer is severely impaired when cells are depleted of caveolin - 1 . Only a subset of additional caveolar components ( cavin - 2 and EHD2 ) are present at sites of bacterial transfer and although clathrin and the clathrin - associated proteins Eps15 and AP2 are absent from the bacterial invaginations , efficient L . monocytogenes spreading requires the clathrin - interacting protein epsin - 1 . We also directly demonstrate that isolated L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions can trigger the recruitment of caveolar proteins in a neighboring cell . The engulfment of these bacterial and cytoskeletal structures through a caveolin - based mechanism demonstrates that the classical nanometer scale theoretical size limit for this internalization pathway is usurped by these bacterial pathogens . 3 . 2 . Introduction L . monocytogenes kill ~ 25 % of people that they infect 488 . These microbes use clathrin - mediated endocytosis to initially invade a target host cell 338 , resulting in vacuolar - residing bacteria . Secretion of pore - forming toxins from L . monocytogenes that include listeriolysin O ( LLO ) enables the microbe to escape the vacuole and reside in the host cell cytoplasm 493 , 671 . Once free in the host cell cytosol , L . monocytogenes initiates several processes to spread into neighboring cells , thus propagating infection . To accomplish this , the bacteria generate actin - rich structures ( comet / rocket tails ) at one of their poles , which enables their intracellular motility 493 , 520 . When in close opposition to the host cell plasma membrane these actin - rich tails provide the propulsive force necessary to distend the host plasma membrane , forming bacteria - led actin - rich protrusions that can extend up to 100µm 115 , 476 , 493 , 672 . The force generated by these structures is thought to drive the bacteria into neighboring cells . This indispensable role of actin polymerization at the bacterial cell surface is supported by several observations of abolished intra - and intercellular movement of L . monocytogenes bacteria within and amongst host cells treated with filamentous actin inhibitors 493 , 494 , 673 . The subsequent uptake of L . monocytogenes 92 membrane protrusions by neighboring host cells ultimately allows the bacteria to continue the disease process . Classical endocytic mechanisms often exploit clathrin or caveolin as key proteins for the internalization of various particles 328 , 396 , 674 . Although clathrin commonly internalizes material into 30 - 150nm vesicles , bacteria ( including L . monocytogenes ) have devised strategies to control the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery for their own large - scale endocytic events 338 , 347 , 348 . Alternatively , caveolin - based endocytosis remains a process that internalizes extracellular material into bulb - shaped caveolae of a maximum size of ~ 100nm 405 , 406 , 675 . Both clathrin and caveolin endocytosis require an assortment of accessory proteins to form invaginations and ultimately cut the membranous neck at the terminal stages of the structures formation prior to vesicle release 328 . While some of these accessory proteins are shared by both endocytic mechanisms ( dynamin - 2 431 , 676 and actin 440 , 677 ) , most remain segregated to their respective internalization pathways . Fundamental mechanistic questions of how L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions are internalized into neighboring cells remains unanswered . In this study , we explore the involvement of the host endocytic machinery during L . monocytogenes infections and show that L . monocytogenes intercellular spreading relies primarily on caveolar elements ( caveolin - 1 , cavin - 2 , EHD2 ) , but also usurps phosphatidylserine , dynamin - 2 and epsin - 1 . 3 . 3 . Results To begin to unravel the endocytic mechanism used by L . monocytogenes as they move from cell - to - cell , we initially immunolocalized clathrin and caveolin - 1 to invaginations generated by L . monocytogenes protrusions during MDCK cell infections . We found that caveolin - 1 , but not clathrin , accumulated at those sites ( Figure 3 . 1A ) . Morphologically , caveolin - 1 delineated the entire invagination and accumulated as bright puncta along the structures ( Figure 3 . 1A ) . To confirm that the cell forming the bacterial invagination ( receiving the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion ) was the source of the observed increase in caveolin - 1 , we utilized a mixed cell assay whereby infected HeLa cells were overlaid onto uninfected cells that were also previously transfected with fluorescently - tagged caveolin - 1 . We found that caveolin - 1 - mCherry was recruited along the entire 93 length of the invaginations when expressed in the invagination forming cells ( Figure 3 . 1B ) . Conversely , there was no obvious enrichment of clathrin - GFP at the invaginations ( Figure 3 . 1B ) . To characterize caveolin - 1 accumulation at these sites in more detail , we plotted the pixel intensity profiles of F - actin and caveolin - 1 ( or clathrin ) based on a 1 . 5  m line drawn perpendicularly across the membrane protrusion / invagination . From our analyses of spreading events in MDCK and HeLa cells , endogenous caveolin - 1 as well as the caveolin - 1 - mCherry signal at the structures generally presented as 2 peaks that were peripheral to a strong single F - actin peak originating from the actin - rich core of the membrane protrusions ( Figure 3 . 1C - D and Figure 3 . 8A - F’’ ) . Neither endogenous clathrin nor clathrin - GFP generated the 2 characteristic peaks as was observed with caveolin - 1 . Instead , clathrin generated a low level signal across the entire structure ( Figure 3 . 1E - F and Figure 3 . 9A - F’’ ) . The increased signal of caveolin - 1 at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations did not coincide with alterations to endogenous caveolin - 1 protein levels during 8 or 24 hour infections of MDCK or HeLa cells when compared to uninfected samples ( Figure 3 . 1G ) . We have recently identified CD147 as a marker of L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations 678 . Thus , to quantify the frequency with which caveolin - 1 delineates L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations , we co - expressed CD147 - GFP with caveolin - 1 - mCherry in invagination - forming host cells . We found that ~ 95 % of CD147 - GFP - positive membrane invaginations were also enriched with caveolin - 1 - mCherry during infections of either HeLa or MDCK cells ( Figure 3 . 10A - D ) . We also examined CD147 - positive membrane invaginations using CD147 - targeting antibodies and found that ~ 92 % of CD147 ( endogenous ) - positive invaginations were delineated with caveolion - 1 - mCherry in both HeLa and MDCK cell lines ( Figure 3 . 10E - H ) . The empty mCherry vector did not localize to the CD147 - positive membrane invaginations ( Figure 3 . 10 ) . Taken together , these data point to caveolin - 1 as another component of L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . Using the same mixed cell assay we continued to catalogue proteins used by the caveolin pathway that might also be hijacked at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations and found only cavin - 2 and EHD2 present at the structures ( Figure 3 . 2A ) . Caveolar components such as cavin - 1 , cavin - 3 and pacsin2 as well as the clathrin - associated proteins AP2 and Eps15 were absent from the L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations ( Figures 3 . 11 and 3 . 12 ) . Line scan analysis of cavin - 2 and EHD2 at the 94 invaginations resembled those performed on L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations labeled by caveolin - 1 , with 2 peaks present at the periphery of a single actin peak ( Figure 3 . 2B and Figure 3 . 13A - F’’ ) . To further characterize L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations , we examined them at various stages of their progression using caveolin - 1 - mCherry localization . Caveolin - 1 - mCherry was present at the initial contact sites when the membrane protrusions interacted with the receiving cell membrane ( Figure 3 . 2C ) . A trailing streak of caveolin - 1 - mCherry was routinely observed when the invaginations elongated within the receiving cells . This presumably was labelling the plasma membrane prior to vacuole formation ( Figure 3 . 2C ) . Caveolin - 1 - mCherry maintained its presence following apparent scission events as it continued to surround the microbes contained within vacuole - like structures ( Figure 3 . 2C ) . Multiple bacteria were often found contained within those structures ( Figure 3 . 2C ) . Vacuolar localization of caveolar proteins also held true for cavin - 2 - GFP and EHD2 - GFP ( Figure 3 . 2D - E ) . Our observations of linear and punctate caveolin - 1 localization at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations suggested that at least a subset of these structures could have caveolae associated with them . To examine this , we used electron microscopy and found structures resembling caveolae at the tips of some of the invaginations ( Figure 3 . 2F ) . However , in most instances the invaginations lacked any noticeable caveolar structures ( Figure 3 . 2F’ ) . It is well - known that caveolin and other caveolar components interact with or regulate phospholipid species at the plasma membrane 400 , 401 , 679 , 680 . Phosphatidylserine plays a key role in caveolae biogenesis and stability as well as proper caveolin - 1 clustering at the structures 681 . We examined whether this lipid was also enriched at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . To visualize the distribution of phosphatidylserine in the invagination forming cells , we utilized a previously generated phosphatidylserine sensor that makes use of the discoidin C2 domain of lactadherin fused to GFP ( Lact - C2 - GFP ) 682 . Using our mixed cell assays , we saw an enrichment of the phosphatidylserine probe along the entire length of L . monocytogenes invaginations ( Figure 3 . 2G ) . Line scan analysis of Lact - C2 - GFP at the structures also generated the characteristic dual peak surrounding actin ( Figure 3 . 14A - A’’ ) . Although few studies have examined the precise lipid composition of caveolae , recent work from Román - Fernández and colleagues ( 2018 ) has shown that 95 PIP2 ( phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 ) - bisphosphate ) is a crucial determinant of caveolin - 1 - positive apical endocytic bodies 683 . Thus , to further our examination of lipids at L . monocytogenes invaginations we utilized the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of Akt fused to mCherry ( Akt - PH - mCherry ) 684 , which targets both PIP2 ( phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 ) - bisphosphate ) and PIP3 ( phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ) . Examination of L . monocytogenes invaginations revealed this probe along the entire structure ( Figure 3 . 15A ) . To confirm that the localization of these caveolae - associated lipids at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations was specific , we looked for lactosylceramide ( LacCer ) , a lipid species known to be absent at caveolae 685 . Using the mixed cell assay , we saw no obvious enrichment of LacCer at the invaginations in cells that were pre - labelled with the fluorescent LacCer probe ( BODIPY - LacCer ) ( Figure 3 . 15B ) . Induction of plasma membrane curvature is crucial during endocytosis 686 , 687 . This is often accomplished by the BAR domain - containing family of proteins such as amphiphysin 1 as well as the clathrin associated protein epsin - 1 364 , 688 – 691 . To determine whether these types of proteins are involved in the internalization of L . monocytogenes during cell - to - cell spreading , we utilized the mixed cell assay to examine epsin - 1 , the BAR domain - containing proteins amphiphysin 1 and FCHO1 as well as other membrane curving proteins such as intersectin - 1 and NECAP at L . monocytogenes invaginations . We found that only epsin - 1 was present at these sites ( Figure 3 . 3A - B ) . This was surprising as epsin - 1 is generally recognized as a clathrin - dependent protein , but was present despite the absence of clathrin at the invaginations . Finally , we used the mixed cell assay to examine dynamin2 and filamentous actin in the invagination forming cells as both proteins are used during terminal endocytic processes 350 , 692 . Interestingly , dynamin2 did not concentrate at the scission point , but rather localized predominantly around the bacterial region of the invagination ( Figure 3 . 3C ) . To examine the actin filaments in only the invagination forming cells , we utilized a fluorescently - tagged version of the small F - actin - binding peptide LifeAct 27 . The LifeAct - associated actin filaments from those cells clearly accumulated around the entire length of the invagination ( Figure 3 . 3C ) . Line scan analyses of both epsin - 1 and F - actin ( LifeAct ) at invaginations again produced 2 peaks , characteristic of those previously seen at sites ( Figure 3 . 3D ) . Although several studies report on the extent to which L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions can grow in size 115 , 534 , 539 , there is a dearth of analysis on the size of the corresponding invaginations that are generated . To answer this question , we measured the lengths of 35 caveolin - 1 - mCherry positive membrane 96 invaginations where fusion of the membrane at their distal ends was morphologically identifiable . The average length of these structures was found to be 9 . 5 µm ( Figure 3 . 3E ) . We made further use of CD147 as a marker of L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations to examine the localization frequency of other invagination - associated components , namely cavin - 2 , EHD2 , epsin - 1 and Lact - C2 ( Phosphatidylserine ) . We found that cavin - 2 , EHD2 , epsin - 1 and Lact - C2 localized to CD147 - positive membrane invaginations on average 95 % , 94 % , 84 % and 91 % of the time respectively in HeLa cells ( Figure 3 . 16 ) . We localized the same proteins to CD147 - positive invaginations generated in MDCK cells and observed similar frequencies of co - localization : 94 % ( cavin - 2 ) , 95 % ( EHD2 ) , 79 % ( epsin1 ) and 95 % ( Lact - C2 [ Phosphatidylserine ] ) ( Figure 3 . 17 ) . We next set out to ascertain the functional importance of caveolin - 1 during the cell - to - cell spreading of L . monocytogenes . Researchers have routinely used cholesterol depleting agents such as methyl -  - cyclodextrin and filipin to study caveolin / caveolae - mediated endocytosis 693 – 696 . However , it is well known that these agents can severely inhibit an assortment of endocytic processes including clathrin - mediated endocytosis and lipid raft homeostasis 697 – 700 . To get around the broad action of these drugs we generated a stably transfected shRNA caveolin - 1 knock - down ( KD ) cell line ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . Western blot analysis of these cells indicated a ~ 95 % reduction in caveolin - 1 protein levels compared to control shRNA cells ( Figure 3 . 4B ) . We first examined the general appearance of the caveolin - 1 KD cells by phase imaging and phalloidin staining , and saw that single isolated cells as well as cell monolayers appeared morphologically indistinguishable from control shRNA cells ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , caveolin - 1 depletion did not visibly affect the endogenous protein levels of clathrin or epsin - 1 ( Figure 3 . 4C - D ) . We used these cells for bacterial intercellular spreading assays and found that cell - to - cell spreading of L . monocytogenes was significantly impaired ( by ~ 70 % ) relative to control cells ( Figure 3 . 4E - F and Figure 3 . 18A ) ; occasionally , even restricting the majority of bacteria to a single host cell ( Figure 3 . 4G ) . To ensure that the observed spreading defects from the caveolin - 1 KD cells were not caused by bacterial replication or invasion deficiencies , we performed gentamicin protection assays . When we examined bacterial loads from 3 hour infections , we found that the caveolin - 1 KD cells had a marginal ( ~ 1 . 13x ) , yet significant , increase in bacterial loads as compared to those from control shRNA cells ( Figure 3 . 4H ) . After 8 hour infections we found no significant difference between the bacterial loads obtained from caveolin - 1 KD and control shRNA cells ( Figure 3 . 18B ) . Another potential factor which 97 could affect bacterial spreading in the caveolin - 1 KD cells is the proper formation of actin comet / rocket tails , as those structures are used to propel the bacteria towards the host cell periphery prior to membrane protrusion generation . We measured the length and linearity ( or tortuosity 673 ) of 60 comet / rocket tails generated in the caveolin - 1 KD and control shRNA cell lines and found that the morphology of comet / rocket tails remained unchanged with caveolin - 1 depletion ( Figure 3 . 4I - J ) . Similarly , we analyzed the morphology of at least 40 L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions , as the proper formation of these structures is also required for efficient bacterial cell - to - cell dissemination 249 , 534 , 678 , 701 , and found no significant difference in the length or tortuosity of the structures ( Figure 3 . 4K - L ) . Finally , we quantified the frequency of membrane protrusion formation and found that there was no significant difference in the number of protrusions generated in the caveolin - 1 KD and control shRNA cell lines ( Figure 3 . 18C ) . These findings suggest that the spreading defects likely arise due to an irregularity at the invaginations . One potential explanation for this might be that the invaginations generated in caveolin - 1 KD cells are shorter in length than those formed in control shRNA cells . To test this , we measured the length of invaginations generated in the caveolin - 1 KD and control shRNA cell lines and found that the invaginations were ~ 47 % shorter in the caveolin - 1 KD cells as compared to their counterparts generated in control cells ( Figure 3 . 18D ) . The concentration of epsin - 1 along the entire L . monocytogenes invagination phenocopied the caveolin - 1 localization and similarly to caveolin - 1 , epsin - 1 expression levels were unaltered when compared to uninfected cells ( Figure 3 . 5A ) . To examine the importance of epsin - 1 during L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell spreading we utilized stably transfected siRNA epsin - 1 KD cells ( Figure 3 . 5B ) . Western blot analysis of these cells showed a ~ 92 . 5 % reduction in epsin - 1 protein levels compared to stably transfected control siRNA cells ( Figure 3 . 5C ) . L . monocytogenes intercellular spreading assays performed in these cells resulted in a significant ( ~ 25 % ) reduction in bacterial dissemination ( Figure 3 . 5D - E and 3 . 18E - F ) . During these assays , we saw on occasion bacteria that were also restricted to a single host cell ( Figure 3 . 5F ) . Similar to our previous finding with caveolin - 1 depletion , bacterial loads were augmented marginally ( ~ 1 . 15 - fold ) , but significantly , in the epsin - 1 KD cells as compared to control siRNA cells ( Figure 3 . 5G ) . To examine in more mechanistic detail the role of epsin - 1 at invaginations we used domain deletion mutant constructs to determine which parts of epsin - 1 were involved in its localization to the 98 structures ( Figure 3 . 5H ) . All but the ΔENTH mutant of epsin - 1 maintained localization to invaginations ( Figure 3 . 5I ) . Line scan analyses of all epsin - 1 constructs ( but not the ΔENTH mutant of epsin - 1 ) depicted the characteristic 2 peaks peripheral to a strong single F - actin peak coming from the membrane protrusions ( Figure 3 . 19A ) . Epsin - 1 ENTH interacts with plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) and it is this interaction which permits epsin - 1 to directly modify membrane curvature during endocytosis 364 , 691 , 702 . When expressed alone , the ENTH domain of epsin - 1 localized to L . monocytogenes invaginations , suggesting that the ENTH domain likely plays a crucial role during L . monocytogenes invagination formation ( Figure 3 . 5J ) . Line scan analysis of ENTH - GFP at the invagination also generated the characteristic dual peak surrounding actin ( Figure 3 . 19B ) . The prevailing hypothesis regarding the mechanism behind L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell transfer largely hinges on the microbes actin - based motility and the resulting propulsive forces generated at their cell surface 493 , 539 , 703 . While it is possible that our observed recruitment of caveolin - 1 to invaginations arises solely due to the actin - based motility of the bacteria we do not think this is the principal mechanism . In fact , potential mechanisms underlying the requirement of caveolar components in L . monocytogenes spreading could involve global effects on the plasma membrane , such as lipid / protein composition and / or membrane tension . To begin to resolve these possibilities we set out to demonstrate that the physical membrane protrusions alone can trigger caveolin - 1 recruitment upon their contact with the host cell surface . To do this , we adapted a previously developed technique to isolate L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions from infected epithelial cells 115 and added these preparations onto naive epithelial cells that were previously transfected with fluorescently - tagged caveolin - 1 . To first confirm the presence of intact isolated membrane protrusions , we isolated the structures from cells expressing the plasma membrane marker pmKate2 - f - mem and saw that pmKate2 - f - mem clearly delineated the structures ( Figure 3 . 6A ) . We also stained samples of isolated membrane protrusions for the host protein ezrin , a well - known marker of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions 249 , and saw that endogenous ezrin was enriched within the actin - rich core of the structures confirming that the isolated structures were in fact bacterially - derived membrane protrusions ( Figure 3 . 6B ) . In both preparations , DAPI staining as well as phase contrast images indicated the presence of bacterial cells at one pole of the structures ( Figure 3 . 6A - B ) . When we overlaid isolated membrane protrusions onto naïve 99 cells , we saw that the membrane protrusions , some as large as ~ 8 µm , had concentrated caveolin - 1 around the entire structure ( Figure 3 . 6C ) . Caveolin - 1 enrichment around the isolated membrane protrusion was further reflected in our line scan analysis of the structure ( Figure 3 . 6D ) . When we performed similar experiments examining other caveolar proteins , fluorescently - tagged cavin - 2 and EHD2 but not dynamin2 , concentrated around the overlaid isolated membrane protrusions ( Figure 3 . 6E and Figure 3 . 20 ) . 3 . 4 . Discussion The examination of cell - to - cell spreading events during L . monocytogenes infections has historically concentrated on the formation of the protrusions , leaving the invaginations poorly studied . Here we report that L . monocytogenes hijacks the caveolin - endocytic machinery to move from one epithelial cell to another . Our data points to a subset of classical caveolar proteins ( caveolin - 1 , cavin - 2 and EHD2 ) as key components for the internalization of these large formations . We also document the presence of known caveolin - associated lipids at the structures . The involvement of the clathrin - mediated endocytic protein , epsin - 1 , at the membrane of these caveolin - based invaginations is peculiar as other clathrin - associated machinery such as clathrin itself , eps15 and AP2 are excluded from the sites . Reasons for the presence of epsin - 1 may lie in its ability to curve the plasma membrane during endocytosis 364 . Epsin - 1 is classically known to induce the curvature of membrane through the direct insertion of its N - terminal alpha - helix , helix0 , into the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane 362 , 364 , 704 . Given that a spheroid shape would be generated at the region where the L . monocytogenes protrusion makes initial contact with the plasma membrane of the neighboring cell , which is a similar curved shape as that of an initially forming endocytic vesicle , epsin - 1 could function at these sites as a membrane curving protein , inserting itself into the membrane to help promote the initial formation of the invagination . Although epsin - 1 is normally used for clathrin - coated endocytic pit curve formation 364 , 688 – 690 , work from the McMahon lab clearly demonstrates that epsin - 1 ( or even just the ENTH domain of epsin - 1 ) when co - incubated with liposomes , can generate elongated tubules 364 , 691 , 704 that morphologically resemble the tubular component of L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations . Thus , we postulate that epsin - 1 could also interact with the highly curved membrane along the tubular aspect of the L . monocytogenes membrane invagination ( oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the structures ) . Further support for this 100 possibility comes from the work of Capraro and colleagues ( 2010 ) who demonstrated that the epsin - 1 ENTH domain binds preferentially to highly curved membrane tethers 705 . In the future it will be interesting to see whether epsin - 1 is also used for the caveolin - dependent internalization of other large particles . How might caveolae and their associated proteins manage to physically distort the plasma membrane and engulf the entire L . monocytogenes protrusions ? Clues to this may lie in evidence from Sinha and co - workers who demonstrated that caveolae flatten with a concomitant integration of caveolin - 1 into the plasma membrane as the cells experience mechanical stress 403 . Our images show caveolin - 1 delineating the invaginating membrane in a manner similar to the model proposed by Sinha and colleagues , and our observation that caveolae are present at invaginations supports this model . Additionally , while we have electron microscopic evidence documenting structures resembling caveolae at the tip of the membrane invagination ( adjacent to the bacteria ) , it is likely that these structures also populate the stalk and distal regions of invaginations as fluorescent images of endogenous caveolin - 1 show a punctate staining pattern , reminiscent of caveolae staining . Thus , given the presence of the caveola - like structures in electron micrographs together with our observation of linear and punctum - like caveolar protein localization along the entirety of invaginations , we propose a model whereby the L . monocytogenes protrusion initially contacts the recipient cell and uses the membrane from already present caveolae to begin to lengthen the invaginations until caveolae in the invaginating zone all flatten . Consequently , the resulting elongated invagination contains caveolar proteins but no caveolae ( Figure 3 . 7 ) . Our findings showing that invaginations are shorter in cells depleted of caveolin - 1 gives credence to this possibility . Whether or not caveolae preferentially flatten at the earlier stages of the invagination process rather than once they have elongated will require future study . Cargo uptake via caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis is normally triggered through ligand - receptor interactions 341 , 443 – 449 , 693 , 706 , 707 . However , support for ligand - independent caveolin - 1 function at plasma membrane caveolae also exists 402 . Could ligand - receptor - mediated signaling also play a role in the recruitment of caveolin - 1 and other caveolar proteins to invaginations ? From our experiments involving isolated L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions , it is implied that contact alone of the structures with the host cell surface is sufficient to trigger recruitment of caveolin - 1 , cavin - 2 and EHD2 . Coupled with our recent finding of the host plasma membrane receptor CD147 at L . monocytogenes membrane 101 invaginations 678 , the potential for a ligand ( s ) on the surface of protrusions , interacting with a corresponding receptor ( s ) on the cell that will form the invaginations , presents a compelling area of further investigation . Furthermore , the visually elevated levels of these caveolar proteins surrounding the structures also points to the possibility that pre - assembled caveolar vesicles could incorporate their proteins into the plasma membrane as an endocytic unit at sites of membrane invaginations 441 , 708 rather than being recruited separately . Unlike these aforementioned proteins , dynamin2 remained absent at contact sites of the isolated membrane protrusions and the underlying cell . During cell - to - cell spreading experiments , dynamin2 had an unusual localization at the invagination , being restricted to the region of the bacterium . This recruitment is contrary to its classical function at the neck of endocytic pits , where assemblies of dynamin2 collars catalyze , via GTP , membrane scission of the budding vesicle 676 , 709 – 711 . One potential explanation behind this may lie in the L . monocytogenes internalin family of proteins which are involved in several stages of its infection cycle . The cell surface internalins A ( InlA ) and B ( InlB ) control initial bacterial invasion into cells 478 , 542 , 543 , whereas the secreted internalins C ( InlC ) and P ( InlP ) have been shown to promote bacterial cell - to - cell and cell - to - basement membrane transfer respectively 495 , 586 . Consequently , future investigations into the L . monocytogenes infection cycle should focus on evaluating whether or not these bacterial components are also involved in the caveolin - mediated engulfment of membrane protrusions . Despite the sparsity of studies examining the internalization of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions , one study has provided insight into a process that is at play during the infections . The process of efferocytosis involves the removal of dead ( or dying ) material primarily by phagocytic cells . This process causes the weakening of the phagocytic cell plasma membrane prior to the removal of the dying material and L . monocytogenes takes advantage of this process 538 . Phosphatidylserine is commonly found within host cells , however Czuczman and co - workers ( 2014 ) found that Annexin V ( a phosphatidylserine marker ) was present on the surface of membrane protrusions generated by L . monocytogenes during HeLa cell infections , suggesting a certain degree of damage to the host cell plasma membrane 538 . Through the use of TIM - 4 ( an efferocytosis component that recognises phosphatidylserine ) KO mice and macrophages they also found that this protein was involved in the dissemination of L . monocytogenes . We also examined phosphatidylserine , but looked specifically for its presence at invaginations as phosphatidylserine is also involved in organizing caveolar biogenesis 681 . 102 How the efferocytosis event at the protrusion may be linked to the formation of the corresponding invagination in epithelial cells remains to be determined . Microbes often find strategies to usurp classical endocytic size limits . L . monocytogenes , Staphyloccocus aureus and Candida albicans use clathrin - mediated endocytosis , a process once thought to be limited to ~ 150nm vesicles , for their initial entry into epithelial cells 347 , 712 , whereas Shigella flexneri depend on clathrin and its associated proteins for cell - to - cell spreading 349 . Caveolae , strictly defined , are too small [ ~ 100nm ] 405 , 406 , 675 to engulf L . monocytogenes protrusions , however ; our evidence suggests that caveolae have a direct local effect on the membrane that permits engulfment of large structures into the cell . The idea that caveolae can be locally permissive for endocytosis by potentially providing membrane to release into large invaginations , without themselves budding from the structures , opens the door for researchers to consider this process during other microbial infections and during the general internalization of particles that are beyond the current theoretical size restriction . Our work also provides a way to re - interpret some of the literature on caveolar endocytosis and to resolve some of the many controversies in the field . 3 . 5 . Materials and Methods 3 . 5 . 1 . Cell culture Human cervical ( HeLa ) and Canis familiaris kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ( numbers CCL - 2 and CCL - 34 respectively ) . Stable HeLa cell lines transfected with control [ non - targeting ] or epsin - 1 - targeting sequences were generated from wild - type HeLa cell and cultured as described previously 713 . All cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing high glucose ( Hyclone , GE Healthcare ) and supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . All cell lines were maintained in a cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . To seed cells for experiments , flasks containing cells were washed 3X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS [ - / - ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , trypsinized with 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , counted and seeded onto clear polystyrene 6 - well or 24 - well plates ( Corning ) containing glass coverslips . For electron microscopy , flexible silicone elastomer membranes ( Flexcell International ) were used in place of glass coverslips . 103 3 . 5 . 2 . Caveolin - 1 shRNA HeLa cells with stable knockdown of caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) as well as control [ non - targeting ] were generated via lentiviral mediated transduction . Lentivirus particles containing pLKO . 1 based plasmids including gene specific targeting sequences were produced . This was followed by puromycin selection ( 2ug / mL ) . ShCav1 sequence used : TRCN0000008002 ( targeting open reading frame ) . 3 . 5 . 3 . Bacterial strains and growth conditions The L . monocytogenes strain EGD BUG 600 ( gifted by Dr . Pascale Cossart ) was used throughout this study and was grown at 37°C using either brain heart infusion ( BHI ) agar or broth ( BD Biosciences ) . 3 . 5 . 4 . Listeria monocytogenes infections To infect cells , overnight shaken broth cultures of L . monocytogenes were diluted 10 - fold in fresh BHI broth ( final volume of 10 mL ) and then incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator ( on an angle ) until A 600 = 1 . 00 . At A 600 = 1 . 00 , 1 mL of bacteria were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10 , 000 rpm ( 25°C ) and washed 2x with pre - warmed ( 37°C ) PBS [ - / - ] . Pelleted bacteria were re - suspended with 1 mL of pre - warmed serum - free media ( DMEM ; 37°C ) then diluted 100X . Diluted bacteria were added onto culture plates containing host cells and incubated for at least 6 - 8 hours to study actin comet / rocket tail and membrane protrusion / invagination formation . 3 . 5 . 5 . Mixed cell infections One batch of HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 2 x 10 6 per well in 6 well format plates without coverslips . On the same day , in separate 6 well plates ( containing coverslips ) , a second batch of HeLa cells seeded at 2 . 25 x 10 6 were added per well . The following day , the HeLa cells seeded previously at a density of 2 . 25 x 10 6 were transfected ( as described below ) with DNA plasmids encoding the fluorescently - tagged protein of interest to be examined at L . monocytogenes invaginations . On day 3 , the untransfected HeLa cells ( seeded previously at a density of 2 x 10 6 per well ) were infected ( as described above ) with wild type L . monocytogenes at an MOI of ~ 40 . At 2 hours post infection , the 104 infected cells were washes three times with PBS [ - / - ] and then 1 mL of pre - warmed DMEM containing 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 μg / mL ) was added to each well to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . After 3 hours of infection had passed , the infected cells were detached and enumerated . Approximately 1 x 10 6 infected cells were then overlaid onto well plates containing the previously uninfected / transfected cells . Gentamicin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg / mL . Samples were fixed 5 hours following the overlaying procedure and stained with fluorescent phalloidin and DAPI as described below . The examination of fluorescently - tagged proteins of interest at L . monocytogenes spreading events was performed by microscopic analysis whereby untransfected but infected cells ( the cells appeared black to the eye of the microscopist ) were sending out L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions directly into and generating invaginations in the adjacent transfected cells ( as visually determined by the microscopist through a combination of fluorescent and phase microscopy ) . Care was taken to ensure that each membrane protrusion could be visually traced back to the original sending ( untransfected cell ) . 3 . 5 . 6 . Reagents and antibodies Antibodies and reagents used in this study included : Alexa Fluor 594 - and 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) ; CellTracker Blue ( Invitrogen ) ; BODIPY - lactosylceramide ( Invitrogen ) ; Alexa Fluor 594 - and 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse antibodies ( 2 μg / mL , Invitrogen ) ; rabbit anti - caveolin - 1 ( 10 μg / mL for immunofluorescence , Abcam , ab2910 ) ; mouse anti - clathrin heavy chain ( 5 μg / mL for immunofluorescence , BD Biosciences , 610499 ) ; mouse anti - α - tubulin ( 1 : 1000 for Western blot , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , 12G10 ) ; mouse anti - ezrin ( 1 : 100 for immunofluorescence , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , CPTC - Ezrin - 1 ) ; rabbit anti - Listeria monocytogenes ( 1 : 300 for immunofluorescence , BD Difco , 223021 ) ; HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit antibodies ( 1 μg / mL , Invitrogen ) . The mouse monoclonal anti - α - tubulin antibody ( 12G10 ) was deposited to the DSHB by Frankel , J . / Nelsen , E . M . The mouse monoclonal anti - ezrin antibody ( CPTC - Ezrin - 1 ) was deposited to the DSHB by Clinical Proteomics Technologies for Cancer . The mouse anti - epsin - 1 antibody ( 1 : 10 dilution for immunofluorescence , clone zz3 ) was generated previously 714 . 105 3 . 5 . 7 . Immunolocalization Cells on glass coverslips were fixed at room temperature ( in the dark ) for 15 minutes using pre - warmed ( 37ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde ( prepared in 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM Na / K PO 4 , 5 . 0 mM KCl , pH 7 . 3 ) and then washed 3X using PBS [ - / - ] . Cells were permeabilized using room temperate 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 5 minutes or −20°C acetone for 10 minutes . Following Triton permeabilization , coverslips were rinsed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] , whereas acetone treated coverslips were dried at room temperature for 30 minutes . All samples were blocked with 5 % normal goat serum ( in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 25 minutes and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies prepared in TPBS / BSA ( PBS [ - / - ] , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] ) . The next day samples were washed 3X with TPBS / BSA for 10 minutes and then treated with secondary antibodies ( AlexaFluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) at room temperature in the dark for 2 hours . To visualize F - actin , samples were treated with AlexaFluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes . Samples were washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] and mounted onto glass microscope slides using the Prolong Diamond antifade mounting medium ( + / - DAPI ) ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . 3 . 5 . 8 . Lysate preparation and Western blotting Cells were washed 3X with pre - warmed PBS [ + / + ] and then treated with 4°C RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid , 10 % SDS ) containing a cOmplete™ Mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) on ice for 5 minutes . Cell scrapers were used to disrupt and lysates were then collected into microcentrifuge tubes . Lysates were spun at 4°C and 10 , 000 g for 10 minutes to pellet cellular debris and DNA ; supernatants were collected into fresh 4°C microcentrifuge tubes and immediately stored at −80°C . Protein concentrations were ascertained using a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay kit ( Pierce ) . For Western blotting , lysates samples were prepared in 6X Laemmli buffer then boiled ( 100°C ) for 10 minutes . Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and resolved by electrophoresis . Gels were rinsed in distilled water for 5 minutes and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot® SD semi - dry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were washed for 5 minutes in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) with shaking , blocked with 4 % Blotto ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) prepared in TBST ( 1 106 hour shaking ) and then treated with primary antibodies ( diluted in TBST , 1 % BSA ) overnight at 4°C . The next day , membranes were rinsed 3X with TBST for 10 minutes prior to incubation with secondary antibodies ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) for 1 hour at room temperature . To visualize protein bands , membranes were treated with Western Lightning Plus - ECL ( PerkinElmer ) following the manufacturer’s instructions imaged using a Fujifilm LAS - 4000 imager ( Fujifilm ) . To confirm equivalent loading , membranes were stripped using mild stripping buffer ( 1 . 5 % glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 2 . 2 ) and re - probed using the mouse anti - α tubulin targeting antibody . 3 . 5 . 9 . Western blot quantification Protein quantification was performed using the gels tool in ImageJ . All analyzed lanes were first adjusted for loading by normalizing the loading control signal against a control lane . Following this , the caveolin - 1 or epsin - 1 signal was normalized against one of the control lanes . To obtain the adjusted and relative caveolin - 1 or epsin - 1 protein levels of each lane , the relative caveolin - 1 or epsin - 1 signal of each lane was divided by the relative loading control of that same lane . 3 . 5 . 10 .

DNA plasmid encoding pmKate2 - f - mem ( cat no . FP186 ) was purchased from Evrogen . 107 3 . 5 . 11 . Cell culture transfections DNA transfections were performed using jetPEI or jetPRIME transfection reagents ( Polyplus Transfection ) and carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cells were transfected ( 3μL reagent and 1 . 5μg plasmid DNA per well [ 6 well plate ] ) then incubated at 37°C for 4 hours . After 4 hours , the media in the wells was replaced and the cells were incubated for at least 24 hours at 37°C to allow for expression of the respective gene product . 3 . 5 . 12 . Gentamicin protection assay Cultured cells in 24 - well cell - bind plates were infected with wild - type L . monocytogenes at an MOI of ~ 15 - 20 for 2 hours to allow for bacterial invasion . After 2 hours of infection the well plates were rinsed 3X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline with Ca2 + and Mg2 + ( PBS [ + / + ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The infections were then allowed to proceed for an additional 1 hour in media containing 50 µg / ml gentamicin ( to kill extracellular bacteria ) . Bacterial loads were also examined after 8 hours following the intercellular spreading assay infection protocol . At the end of the infections , cells were rinsed 5X with PBS [ + / + ] and intracellular bacteria were released by treatment of cells with a 1 % solution of triton X - 100 ( made in PBS [ + / + ] ) for 5 minutes . After the 5 minute incubation , serial dilutions of the wells were performed in 96 well format assay blocks . Dilutions were selected ( so as to give a count of between 30 - 300 bacterial colonies ) , spread onto BHI agar plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C prior to their enumeration . 3 . 5 . 13 . Listeria monocytogenes intercellular spreading assay Cells were infected with diluted wild - type L . monocytogenes ( as described above ) . Cells were rinsed 5X after 2 hours using pre - warmed PBS [ - / - ] and then 1 mL of pre - warmed DMEM containing 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 μg / mL ) was added to each well to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . After 8 hours of infection , cells were fixed and permeabilized using warm ( 37ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % triton X - 100 ( as described above ) . L . monocytogenes bacteria were detected with the rabbit anti - Listeria monocytogenes antisera followed by secondary antibody labelling with Alexa Fluor 594 - 108 conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies . Infection foci ( imaged at 400x magnification ) and the bacterial spreading area determination was performed as described previously 539 . 3 . 5 . 14 . Listeria monocytogenes membrane protrusion isolation Cells cultured in 6 - well plates ( without coverslips ) were infected with wild - type L . monocytogenes for 8 hours ( as described above ) . After 3 hours the cell were treated for 1 hour with CellTracker Blue ( following the manufacturer’s instructions ) . After 8 hours cells were very gently rinsed 3X with pre - warmed media ( 37ºC ) . Following the washes , 1mL of the pre - warmed media was added against the side of each well . A micropipette set to 0 . 9mL was used to aspirate the 1mL of media 10X onto the surface of the cells ( with care so to not generate bubbles ) in order to detach L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions . The CellTracker Blue labelled membrane protrusion - containing media was added onto culture plates of naïve cells . Plates were spun at 2000X g for 5 minutes . Samples were then fixed and processed as described above . 3 . 5 . 15 . Listeria monocytogenes comet / rocket tail and membrane protrusion analysis L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tail lengths were measured manually by the microscopist using the line tool plug - in in the ImageJ software . Measurements were taken from cells infected for 8 hours . Comet / rocket tails which were not visually in focus within 5 z slices ( height of 0 . 8  m ) were excluded from the measurements as well as those where a clear beginning ( bacterium - tail interface ) and end of the tail could not be ascertained . Membrane protrusion lengths were measured as described above . Only membrane protrusions that extended outwards from the edges of the host cell ( in the x - y plane ) were included in the measurements . Those that protruded upwards ( in the z plane ) and were not at the edges of the cell were not included . To determine the distortedness of comet / rocket tails and membrane protrusions we determined the tortuosity index of the structures which is defined as the ratio of the actual tail / protrusion length to the shortest distance between the bacterium - tail interface and the end of the tail / protrusion . The average frequency of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions generated was calculated as a ratio of the total enumerated L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions divided by the total enumerated bacterially - generated actin - rich structures ( actin clouds , comet tails and membrane protrusions ) . 109 3 . 5 . 16 . Electron microscopy Media was replaced with fixative ( 1 . 5 % paraformaldehyde , 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , pH7 . 3 , at room temperature [ rt ] ) for 2 - 3 hours , and then the fixative was replaced with buffer ( 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate , pH7 . 3 , rt ) . The membranes , with attached cells , were cut into 1 - 2 cm 2 pieces . The pieces were placed in glass vials and washed 2X ( 10 minutes each wash ) with fresh buffer . The samples were post - fixed for 1 hour on ice with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate ( pH 7 . 3 ) . The samples were washed 3X ( 10 minutes each wash ) with ddH2O ( rt ) and then stained en bloc with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate ( rt ) . The membranes were again washed three times with ddH2O ( rt ) and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethyl alcohols ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 95 % , 2X 100 % - 10 minutes each ) followed by two treatments with propylene oxide ( 15 minutes each ) . The samples were then placed in 1 : 1 propylene oxide : EMBED 812 resin ( Electron microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) and left overnight . The next day , the membranes were passed through two changes of 100 % EMBED 812 resin and then placed on glass slides with the cells face - up . Embedding capsules were filled with resin , inverted onto the membranes , and then the slides with membranes and embedding capsules placed in an oven ( 60 °C ) for the resin to polymerize for 48 hours . After polymerization , the capsules ( with embedded cells ) were carefully separated from the membranes that remained attached to the slides . The cell layers at the surfaces of the block were sectioned en face using a Leica ultramicrotome and collected onto copper grids . The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and then viewed and images collected using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Electron Microscope operated at 120 kV . 3 . 5 . 17 . Microscopy A Leica DMI4000B ( Leica Microsystems ) inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) was used to acquire all immunofluorescent images . All devices were controlled by MetaMorph Imaging System software ( Universal Imaging ) . Images were evaluated and processed using Metamorph Imaging System software or ImageJ . The pixel intensity plots ( line scan analyses ) were performed using ImageJ by the microscopist whereby the line tool was used to first draw a 1 . 5 µm line perpendicularly across the invagination . Following this the “plot profile” tool was used to obtain the pixel intensity value ( from 0 - 255 ) of the protein of interest , actin and when indicated , CellTracker Blue . Lines were excluded or shifted if 110 intense signal from cellular structures ( such as stress fibers ) , random artifacts or other nearby invaginations interfered with the profile of interest . Line scan analyses were replicated at least 3 times ( and up to 6 times ) for each protein examined . 3 . 5 . 18 . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed ( unblinded ) using GraphPad Prism version 6 . 01 . All results involving immunofluorescence microscopy , line scan analyses and Western blotting were obtained from experiments performed at least 3 times ( n = 3 ) . For quantification involving protein localization frequency at membrane invaginations , Western blotting ( protein levels ) , membrane invaginations ( lengths ) , infection foci ( areas ) , number of intracellular bacteria , comet / rocket tails ( length and tortuosity ) , membrane protrusions ( length , tortuosity and frequency of formation ) , the exact number of repeats performed or samples / field of views analyzed and whether measurements were normalized to controls are indicated in the corresponding figure legends .

Abstract Listeria generate actin - rich tubular protrusions at the plasma membrane that propel the bacteria into neighbouring cells . The precise molecular mechanisms governing the formation of these protrusions remain poorly defined . Here we demonstrate that the PPIase Cyclophilin A ( CypA ) is hijacked by Listeria at membrane protrusions used for cell - to - cell spreading . CypA localizes within the F - actin of these structures and is crucial for their proper formation , as in cells depleted of CypA , these extended actin - rich structures are mis - shaped and collapsed due to changes within the F - actin network . The lack of structural integrity within the Listeria membrane protrusions hampers the microbes from spreading from CypA null cells . Our results demonstrate a crucial role for CypA during Listeria infections . 4 . 2 . Introduction Cyclophilin A ( CypA ) is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells as a cytosolic and / or secreted protein 272 – 274 . As the founding member of a class of enzymes ( prolyl cis - trans isomerases , PPIases ) that promote protein folding and trafficking through their ability to catalyze the isomerization of peptidyl - prolyl bonds 278 , CypA has been reported as an important factor for several biological processes that require actin such as cell migration 274 , 299 , 300 and general cytoskeletal organization 299 . The actin cytoskeleton is a crucial target of the disease - causing enteric bacterial pathogen , Listeria monocytogenes ( L . monocytogenes ) . These bacteria control the host cell’s actin polymerization machinery to invade and move within ( and amongst ) host cells 493 . L . monocytogenes gain their ability to move within host cells through the actions of the N - WASp mimicking bacterial surface protein ActA , which hijacks and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex at the bacterial surface in order to generate branched actin - rich comet tails that propel the bacteria forwards 52 . Movement of the bacteria amongst cells relies on the generation of modified comet tails that form membrane protrusions when the bacteria engage the plasma membrane at the border of the host cells 493 . These actin - rich protrusions cause corresponding invaginations in the neighbouring cells , which ultimately enable L . monocytogenes to be disseminated from one cell to another . 147 Here we demonstrate that L . monocytogenes hijack CypA exclusively at their actin - rich membrane protrusions . Using cells depleted of CypA , we show that these protrusions are structurally collapsed due to the actin network within the structures being morphologically altered at the bacterial attachment site . This results in a significant decrease in the ability of L . monocytogenes to spread from cell - to - cell . L . monocytogenes infections of the null cells that are complemented with GFP - CypA reverts the phenotype of the collapsed protrusions to being indistinguishable from those generated in wild - type cells . Collectively , our findings highlight a novel actin - associated role of a cellular prolyl cis - trans isomerase during the proper formation and function of actin - rich structures that are essential for the progression of L . monocytogenes infections . 4 . 3 . Results 4 . 3 . 1 . Cyclophilin A Is Recruited Exclusively to L . monocytogenes Actin - Rich Membrane Protrusions . L . monocytogenes harness the actin polymerization machinery of their host cells at four distinct times in their infectious cycle : 1 ) during host cell invasion , 2 ) at actin - rich clouds surrounding stationary bacteria , 3 ) at comet tails used for intracellular actin - based motility , and 4 ) when spreading from one cell to another using actin - rich membrane protrusions . To investigate if CypA was recruited to any of these bacterially - generated actin - rich sites , we infected HeLa cells with wild type L . monocytogenes and stained fixed cells using anti - CypA antibodies . We found that CypA was present at L . monocytogenes generated membrane protrusions but was absent from all other actin - rich sites during these infections ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . CypA stabilizes N - WASp through its GPXLP motif 299 ; implying that CypA could be involved in actin regulation . As L . monocytogenes uses an N - WASp mimic that does not contain the GPXLP site , this suggested to us that the observed CypA recruitment to the actin protrusions was independent of N - WASp . To confirm this we co - stained infected cells with anti - CypA and anti - N - WASp antibodies . As expected , N - WASp was absent from the L . monocytogenes protrusions ( Figure 4 . 1C ) . The altered localization of CypA in infected cells did not correspond to a change in expression levels when compared to uninfected cells ( Figure 4 . 1D ) . We also performed infections using a L . monocytogenes actA - deletion mutant , which is unable to generate F - actin networks at its surface , and found that CypA was not present at the surface of these bacteria ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . 148 To further validate our findings , we transfected GFP - CypA into HeLa cells and assessed its presence at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions when expressed in a protrusion originating cell ( sending cell ) or a protrusion engulfing cell ( receiving cell ) . GFP - CypA was present only at membrane protrusions originating from a sending cell , but not at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions or protrusion invaginations when expressed in receiving cells ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . 4 . 3 . 2 . Cyclophilin A is Required for the Proper Formation of L . monocytogenes Membrane Protrusions . To determine the functional importance of CypA at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions we infected cells depleted of CypA ( CypA KO ) with L . monocytogenes and saw that they were severely misshapen when compared to their counterparts in CypA wild - type cells ( Figure 4 . 2A , B ) . Those structures ( confirmed using the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion marker , ezrin ) did not stretch outwards from the host cell and appeared collapsed ( Figure 4 . 2C ) . To confirm that collapsed L . monocytogenes protrusions were not a cell - line specific phenotype , we preformed siRNA - mediated knockdowns of CypA in the A549 , SKOV3 and HeLa cell lines . As expected , CypA was enriched at L . monocytogenes protrusions in cells treated with control non - targeting siRNA ( Figure 4 . 5A ) , whereas in cell lines with CypA knocked - down , we saw similar collapsed protrusions ( Figure 4 . 5B ) as noted in the CypA KO cells . ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . A potential reason for the collapsed protrusions could be the generation of an unfavorable intracellular environment over the course of infection due to high bacterial loads . To test this , we examined L . monocytogenes protrusions generated in CypA KO cells infected with fewer than 10 bacterial cells . We saw that , even in cells with low infection levels , L . monocytogenes protrusions were still collapsed ( Figure 4 . 6 ) . To gain further insight into the collapsed L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions we utilized transmission electron microscopy . L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions are generally straight in their appearance and contain proximally - located branched F - actin that broadens into a relatively uniform thickness at the base of the bacteria ( Figure 4 . 2D , left ) . We found that the overall appearance of collapsed protrusions in CypA KO cells was dramatically altered at the ultrastructural level . We noticed that the actin did not originate as a broad band at the base of some protrusions , but rather came from a narrow zone , which then flared into a broad array more distally ( Figure 4 . 2D , middle ) . Other protrusions 149 showed a mis - orientation of actin filaments along the lateral side of the microbes and a lack of uniformity within the structures ( Figure 4 . 2D , right ) . When CypA KO cells were transfected with either GFP - CypA or an enzymatic mutant ( GFP - CypA - R55A ) , the wild - type morphology of the L . monocytogenes protrusions was rescued ( Figure 4 . 2E ) , suggesting that the PPIase activity of CypA is likely dispensable at L . monocytogenes protrusions . Furthermore , we saw no alteration to the protrusions in CypA WT cells that were transfected with GFP - CypA - R55A as compared to cells transfected with GFP - CypA ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . Because CypA is a protein that is also secreted from cells 273 , we investigated whether secreted CypA could play a role in L . monocytogenes actin - rich protrusion formation . We initially probed the supernatants of cultured CypA WT cells and found that CypA is in fact secreted from the wild - type cells ( Figure 4 . 8A ) . To ascertain the role of secreted CypA on L . monocytogenes protrusion formation , we added 24 hour spent media from cultured CypA WT and CypA KO cells as well as fresh culture media separately onto infected CypA KO cells . In all cases , the L . monocytogenes protrusions remained collapsed suggesting that intracellular CypA is the functioning source of the protein at the structures ( Figure 4 . 8B ) . CypA PPIase activity is a well - known target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . To test if treatment of cells with CsA would affect L . monocytogenes protrusion formation , we treated infected CypA WT cells with CsA ( 20  M ) and examined L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions . Similar to our results using GFP - CypA - R55A , inhibition of CypA PPIase activity did not alter CypA recruitment to the L . monocytogenes protrusions ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . As CypA was not present at comet tails , it was not surprising that they remained morphologically indistinguishable between the KO and wild - type CypA cells ( Figure 4 . 10A - B ) . Taken together , these data indicate that CypA is needed for proper L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation as well as F - actin organization within the structures and does so independently of its PPIase activity . 150 4 . 3 . 3 . Cyclophilin A is Important for L . monocytogenes Cell - to - Cell Spreading . Our observations of collapsed L . monocytogenes protrusions in cells depleted of CypA , suggested that the projection of the structures into neighboring cells and thus the cell - to cell transfer of bacteria might be affected . We initially quantified the abundance of the L . monocytogenes protrusions as compared to all actin - rich structures ( clouds , comet tails and protrusions ) formed by L . monocytogenes in CypA null cells compared to CypA wild - type cells . We found that CypA expression increased the amount of protrusions per infected cell ( Figure 4 . 11A ) . To test the importance of CypA for L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell spreading , we modified a mixed cell population cell - to - cell spreading assay 538 . This allowed us to quantify the number of L . monocytogenes protrusions moving from unlabelled protrusion - sending cells ( either CypA WT or CypA KO ) into uninfected , but labelled ( CellTracker TM Blue ) , L . monocytogenes protrusion - receiving cells ( CypA WT ) ( Figure 4 . 3A ) . As expected , most protrusions originating from CypA KO cells were collapsed ( Figure 4 . 3A and Figure 4 . 11B ) . However , we were able to detect a few protrusions moving from one cell to another ( Figure 4 . 3A and Figure 4 . 11C ) . We calculated a ~ 2 . 5 - fold increase in the number of protrusions moving cell - to - cell when they were generated in cells expressing CypA ( Figure 4 . 3B ) . We also noticed that protrusions moving from CypA WT cells formed clusters of multiple protrusions , whereas CypA KO cells projected only single bacteria whose protrusions were extremely thin ( Figure 4 . 3A and Figure 4 . 11C ) . We also tested whether using CypA KO cells as the protrusion - receiving cell in the spreading assays would alter the efficiency of bacterial cell - to - cell transfer . In these assays , we detected similar collapsed protrusion phenotypes as well as a ~ 3 - fold spreading deficit from bacteria in CypA KO protrusion - sending cells ( Figure 4 . 3C - D ) . We next performed plaque assays , another commonly utilized method to further assess bacterial spreading as well as cytotoxicity resulting from L . monocytogenes infections . Unexpectedly , we found that plaques were generated in monolayers of CypA KO cells infected with L . monocytogenes after only 48 hours ( Figure 4 . 12A - B ) . Conversely , no plaques could be identified at the same time point in infected monolayers of CypA WT cells ( Figure 4 . 12A - B ) . We looked to examine host cell viability earlier in the infections to try to tease out a potential explanation behind the plaque assays . We found that samples of infected CypA KO cells formed numerous clusters of dying cells compared to infected 151 wild - type samples which showed only spaced out and individual dying cells ( Figure 4 . 12C ) . Because of this , we thought one likely scenario to explain the early appearance of plaques could occur from elevated bacterial loads in CypA KO cells compared to wild - type cells resulting in more rapid and aggregative cytotoxicity . We performed gentamicin protection assays to enumerate the number of intracellular bacteria during infections and found a 3 - fold increase in the number of intracellular bacteria within CypA KO cells compared to wild - type cells ( Figure 4 . 13A ) . We also saw abundant clustering of bacteria in CypA KO cells as compared to wild - type cells during early infection time points ( Figure 4 . 13B ) . Taken together , these findings reveal that while CypA functions normally to restrict bacterial invasion , it is hijacked later by L . monocytogenes to promote the efficient cell - to - cell spreading of the bacteria . 4 . 4 . Discussion Here we demonstrate a unique role for CypA in stabilizing actin - rich membrane protrusions generated by L . monocytogenes and thus facilitating L . monocytogenes infection by directly promoting the association of protruding bacteria with neighboring host cells during bacterial spreading events . Additionally , our findings reveal a novel actin - associated role for CypA that does not depend on N - WASp . CypA directly interacts with and stabilizes N - WASp , a cellular activator of Arp2 / 3 - based F - actin nucleation / polymerization 299 . However , the actin - based propulsion and spreading of L . monocytogenes relies solely on the bacterial surface N - WASp mimicking protein , ActA , to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , as L . monocytogenes bacteria readily generate motile comet tails in vitro when co - incubated with purified actin polymerization components that do not include N - WASp 52 , 107 . Although ActA is a very efficient N - WASp mimic , it is not identical , and a number of our findings strongly suggest that CypA may associate with alternative sites at actin - rich structures . First , we find CypA enriched throughout the networked actin - rich core of the L . monocytogenes protrusions rather than just at the bacterial surface where ActA is present . Second , CypA is known to require the GPXLP motif within N - WASp 299 , which is absent in ActA , and thirdly CypA is completely absent from cytosolic actin - rich comet tails . This final point suggests that accessory proteins present at protrusions but not at comet tails might be key for CypA association at those structures . Our finding that the actin network originates from alternative ( narrow or lateral ) regions on the bacteria suggests that this host protein may influence the 152 localization of ActA on L . monocytogenes . This would be the first evidence of a host protein altering the positioning of a bacterial cell surface effector and will require more investigation . Recent studies have uncovered that the secreted L . monocytogenes protein InIC promotes bacterial spreading via its ability to perturb apical junction integrity though antagonism of the host adaptor Tuba 586 . Tuba and its binding partners N - WASp , Sec31 , and Sec13 normally restrict bacterial spreading by generating tension at the cell borders 586 , 720 . While here we show that CypA within the actin - core of protrusions promotes efficient bacterial cell - to - cell spreading , whether or not CypA at apical junction complexes augments junctional tension through N - WASp or is hijacked by the bacteria for their spread will require further study . The most dramatic effects we saw were the collapse of actin - rich membrane protrusions in cells depleted of CypA . This is a rarely seen phenotype that has only been observed with inhibition of the ERM family protein ezrin , a well - known cytoskeletal - plasma membrane linker 249 . Unlike ezrin , we suspect that CypA does not directly interact with and stabilize actin filaments within the growing L . monocytogenes protrusions , as this protein does not possess any known actin - binding motifs . One possibility to explain this stabilizing role is that CypA within the structures is used in a complex to properly recruit or activate other F - actin stabilizers such as ezrin within the L . monocytogenes protrusions . As ezrin ( and other ERM proteins ) is known to require activation via phosphorylation to interact with actin filaments and stabilize these structures , this may explain our finding of altered F - actin networks and collapsed protrusions in the CypA null cells 249 , 721 . In conclusion , we have shown that CypA is an integral factor for the proper formation of L . monocytogenes actin - rich membrane protrusions and that cell - to - cell spreading of L . monocytogenes is significantly attenuated in the absence of CypA . The novel role this molecular chaperone plays at these bacterially - generated structures could have broad applications to other membrane / actin - rich sites within the cell as well as other pathogens that co - opt the host actin cytoskeleton for their disease progression . 153 4 . 5 .

All devices were controlled by MetaMorph Imaging System software ( Universal Imaging ) . Images obtained were evaluated using Metamorph Imaging System software or ImageJ . 155 4 . 5 . 7 . Immunolocalization For immunofluorescence studies , cells on glass coverslips were fixed at room temperature for 15 minutes using pre - warmed ( 37ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde ( prepared in 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM Na / K PO 4 , 5 . 0 mM KCl , pH 7 . 3 ) and then washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] . Cells were permeabilized using room temperate 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 5 minutes or −20°C acetone for 10 minutes . Following Triton X - 100 treatment , coverslips were rinsed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] , whereas acetone treated coverslips were allowed to air dry at room temperature for 30 minutes . All samples were then blocked with 5 % normal goat serum ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes after which samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies prepared in TPBS / BSA ( PBS [ - / - ] , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] ) . Following this , samples were washed 3X with TPBS / BSA for 10 minutes and then treated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) at room temperature for 2 hours . To visualize F - actin , samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 - , 488 - or 350 - conjugated phalloidin ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes . Samples were washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] and mounted onto glass microscope slides using Prolong Diamond antifade mountant either with or without DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . 4 . 5 . 8 . Cell - to - cell spreading assay CypA WT and KO ‘protrusion sending’ cells infected with L . monocytogenes were initially seeded in 6 well format plastic plates at a density of ~ 1 . 25 × 10 5 . Cultures of L . monocytogenes were grown as described above but used at a final dilution of 1 : 50 . Culture plates containing CypA WT or KO ‘protrusion sending’ cells were infected with 1 mL of the diluted bacteria and spun down in a centrifuge for 2 minutes at 1000 rpm then placed in a 37°C incubator for 2 hours . After 2 hours , the infected cells were washed three times with PBS [ - / - ] and then left in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 50 µg ml −1 gentamycin to kill extracellular bacteria for an additional hour in a 37°C incubator . After 3 hours , the cells were detached from wells and overlaid onto 6 well format plastic plates containing 1 . 25 × 10 5 CellTracker Blue labeled CypA WT or CypA KO ‘protrusion receiving’ cells on glass coverslips . To label uninfected CypA WT or CypA KO ‘protrusion receiving’ cells with CellTracker Blue ( Invitrogen ) , 2 hours post infection of the CypA WT or CypA KO ‘protrusion sending’ cells , DMEM containing 20 µM CellTracker Blue was added to wells containing PBS [ + / + ] rinsed CypA WT or CypA KO ‘protrusion receiving’ cells for 1 hour . 156 After 1 hour , cells were rinsed with PBS [ + / + ] and then overlaid with infected CypA WT or KO ‘protrusion sending’ cells . Culture plates were spun down for 2 minutes at 1000 rpm and then placed in a 37°C incubator for a final 6 hours to allow for bacterial spread into the CellTracker Blue labeled cells . After 9 hours , cells were fixed as described above using 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for permeabilization of the host cells and stained using rabbit anti - Listeria monocytogenes antibodies to visualize bacteria and phalloidin to visualize the host cells and protrusions . Bacterial spreading via L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions moving into labeled ‘protrusion receiving’ cells was determined by microscopic analysis . 4 . 5 . 9 . Plaque assay CypA WT and CypA KO cells were seeded separately at a density of 6 . 0x10 5 cells per well in 6 well format well plates . Cells were infected with wild - type L . monocytogenes 3 days post seeding and plates were spun down in a centrifuge for 2 minutes at 1000 rpm then placed in a 37°C incubator for 1 hour . After 1 hour , cells were rinsed with PBS [ + / + ] and then each well was overlaid with an initial agarose layer of 2 - 3 mL of warmed ( 37°C ) DMEM containing 10 % FBS , 0 . 5 % agarose and 50 µg / ml gentamicin . After 48 hours , each well was then overlaid with a second agarose layer of 2 - 3 mL of warmed ( 37°C ) DMEM ( without phenol red ) containing 10 % FBS , 0 . 5 % agarose , 1 % neutral red ( to obtain strong contrast between plaques and viable cells ) and 50 µg / ml gentamicin . Plaques were imaged 1 - 3 hours following the second overlay using a 10X objective lens ( Leica ) and phase contrast . 4 . 5 . 10 . Gentamicin protection assay Cultured cells in well plates were incubated with wild - type L . monocytogenes for 2 hours to allow for bacterial invasion . Following this , well plates were washed 3X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS [ - / - ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and then cells were left to incubate for 1 hour in media containing 50 µg / ml gentamicin ( to kill extracellular bacteria ) . After the 1 hour , cells were rinsed 5X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline containing Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS [ + / + ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and intracellular bacteria released by treatment of cells with a 1 % solution of triton X - 100 ( made in PBS [ + / + ] ) for 5 minutes . After the 5 minute incubation , serial dilutions of the wells were performed in 96 well format assay blocks . 157 Dilutions were selected ( so as to give a count of between 30 - 300 bacterial colonies ) , spread onto BHI agar plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C prior to their enumeration . 4 . 5 . 11 . Cell culture transfections All DNA transfections of cultured cells were performed using jetPEI or jetPRIME transfection reagents ( Polyplus Transfection ) and were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cells were transfected and then incubated at 37°C for 4 hours . Following the 4 hour incubation , media was replaced and the cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C to allow for expression of the respective gene product . Transfected cells were either fixed for viewing by immunofluorescence microscopy or imaged live by time - lapse microscopy . 4 . 5 . 12 . Cyclophilin A RNAi Knockdown A smart pool ( ON - Targetplus siRNA ) of 4 CypA siRNA and 4 non - targeting control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon ( GE Healthcare ) . Transfections were performed using the siRNA transfection reagent INTERFERin ( Polyplus transfection ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , 0 . 1 mL of serum - free media containing 50 nM siRNA duplexes and INTERFERin was added to cells contained in clear polystyrene 24 well culture plates . To obtain cells with undetectable levels of cyclophilin A protein , cells required a 72 - 96 hour incubation period following the siRNA treatment . 4 . 5 . 13 . Lysate preparation and western blotting Lysates were prepared by washing samples 3X with pre - warmed PBS [ - / - ] and then treating the samples with ice - chilled RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid , 10 % SDS ) with cOmplete™ Mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) on ice for 5 minutes . Cells were disrupted using cell scrapers and lysates collected into microcentrifuge tubes . Lysates were spun at 4 °C and 10 , 000 g for 10 minutes to pellet cellular debris ; supernatants were collected into fresh microcentrifuge tubes and immediately stored at −80°C . Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay kit ( Pierce ) . For Western blotting , lysates samples were first prepared in 6X Laemmli buffer then boiled for 10 minutes . Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels 158 and subsequently resolved by electrophoresis . Following separation of the proteins , gels were rinsed in water for 5 minutes and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot® SD semi - dry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . After the transfer , the membranes were washed for 5 minutes in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) , blocked with 4 % Blotto ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) prepared in TBST and then treated with primary antibodies ( diluted in TBST , 1 % BSA ) overnight at 4 °C . The next day , membranes were washed 3X with TBST for 10 minutes each prior to incubating with secondary antibodies ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Membranes were treated with Western Lightning Plus - ECL ( PerkinElmer ) following the manufacturer’s instructions and visualized using a Fujifilm LAS - 4000 imager ( Fujifilm ) . To confirm equal loading , membranes were stripped of bound antibodies with mild stripping buffer ( 1 . 5 % glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 2 . 2 ) and re - probed using an anti -  tubulin targeting antibody as outlined above . 4 . 5 . 14 . Electron microscopy Media was replaced with fixative ( 1 . 5 % paraformaldehyde , 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , pH7 . 3 ) , left for 2 - 3 hours , and then the fixative was replaced with buffer ( 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate , pH7 . 3 ) . The membranes , with attached cells , were gently cut away from cell culture dishes and then further cut into 1 - 2 cm 2 pieces . The pieces were placed in glass vials and then washed twice ( 10 minutes each wash ) with fresh buffer . The samples were post - fixed for 1 hour on ice with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate ( pH 7 . 3 ) . The samples were washed three times ( 10 minutes each wash ) with ddH 2 O and then stained en bloc with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate . The membranes were again washed three times with ddH 2 O and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethyl alcohols ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 95 % , 2X100 % - 10 minutes each ) followed by two treatments with propylene oxide ( 15 minutes each ) . The samples were then placed in 1 : 1 propylene oxide : EMBED 812 resin ( Electron microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) and left overnight . The following day , the membranes were passed through two changes of 100 % EMBED 812 resin and then placed on glass slides with the cells face - up . Embedding capsules were filled with resin , inverted onto the membranes , and then the slides with membranes and embedding capsules placed in an oven ( 60°C ) for the resin to polymerize for 48 hours . After polymerization , the capsules ( with embedded cells ) were carefully separated from the membranes that remained attached to the slides . 159 The cell layers at the surfaces of the block were sectioned en face using a Leica ultramicrotome and collected onto copper grids . The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and then viewed and images collected using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Electron Microscope operated at 120 kV . 4 . 5 . 15 .

Typhimurium ) , enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) and enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) commandeer the actin cytoskeleton of their host cells as a crucial step in their infectious processes . These pathogens depend on the injection of their own effectors directly into target host cells in order to usurp cellular signaling pathways that lead to morphological actin rearrangements in those cells . Here we show that the PPIase Cyclophilin A ( CypA ) is a novel component of S . Typhimurium - induced membrane ruffles and functions to restrict bacterial invasion levels , as in cells depleted of CypA , bacterial loads increase . We also demonstrate that CypA requires the EPEC effector Tir as well as pedestal formation for its recruitment to bacterial attachment sites and that its presence at pedestals also holds during EHEC infections . Finally , we demonstrate that CypA is found at lamellipodia ; actin - rich structures at the leading edge of motile cells . Our findings further establish CypA as a component of dynamic actin - rich structures formed during bacterial infections and within cells in general . 5 . 2 . Introduction Cyclophilin A ( CypA ) is an abundant cytosolic and secreted eukaryotic protein that belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved prolyl cis - trans isomerases ( PPIases ) that catalyze a variety cellular processes that require protein folding and trafficking 272 – 274 . These PPIases catalyze the cis - trans isomerization of peptidyl - prolyl bonds 278 . Previous studies have linked CypA expression to several cellular processes that require actin polymerization such as cell migration and general cytoskeletal remodelling 274 , 299 , 300 . S . Typhimurium and pathogenic E . coli ( EPEC and EHEC ) , manipulate the host actin cytoskeleton for their invasion of host cells and attachment to the cell surface respectively . These bacteria accomplish this by injecting specialized effectors directly into the host cytoplasm through a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) . S . Typhimurium bacteria inject an array of T3SS effectors directly into the host cell cytoplasm that either directly influence actin polymerization ( SipA ) or co - opt host signaling pathways ( SopB , SopE and SopE2 ) leading to the activation of host actin nucleators such as the Arp2 / 3 complex at the regions of S . Typhimurium interaction with the host cell membrane 609 , 610 , 614 , 724 , 725 . Ultimately , this causes localized cytoskeletal remodeling in the form of short - lived actin - rich membrane protrusions ( ruffles ) that extend outwards and engulf the bacteria 726 . 183 EPEC and EHEC remain extracellular where they use their T3SS to inject an assortment of bacterial effectors into host cells to cause disease phenotypes 727 . One of these effectors , the translocated intimin receptor ( Tir ) , becomes embedded in the host plasma membrane where it promotes firm bacterial attachment by docking extracellularly with the bacterial surface protein intimin 593 . Intracellular phosphorylation of Tir at tyrosine 474 allows the attached bacteria to co - opt the actin polymerization machinery to generate an extensive meshwork of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) directly beneath the site of bacterial adherence 108 , 109 , 598 . These F - actin networks press up against the host plasma membrane and raise the bacteria off the natural surface of the host cell ( forming motile structures called pedestals ) enabling them to “surf” atop the epithelia 596 . Here we demonstrate that both invasive and adherent bacterial pathogens hijack CypA during their cytoskeletal remodeling of host cells . We show that CypA is enriched at membrane ruffles generated by S . Typhimurium and functions to restrict bacterial internalization . We also demonstrate that CypA recruitment to EPEC requires the Tir effector and that EHEC pedestals also contain CypA . Finally we show that CypA is present at actin - rich lamellipodia generated at the leading edge of motile cells . 5 . 3 . Results 5 . 3 . 1 . Cyclophilin A is enriched at S . Typhimurium membrane ruffles A crucial initial phase in S . Typhimurium pathogenesis is the ability of the bacteria to gain entry into their host cells . To do this , the bacteria exploit signaling pathways used by their hosts for actin polymerization through the use of injected bacterial effectors . The resulting effect exhibits as aggressive membrane ruffling that ultimately encapsulates any nearby S . Typhimurium and pulls them into the targeted cells 726 . To determine if CypA is recruited to actin - rich membrane ruffles , we infected cultured cells with S . Typhimurium and immunolocalized fixed cells with antibodies against CypA . CypA was enriched at the S . Typhimurium - generated membrane ruffles ( Fig . 5 . 1A ) but did not co - localize completely with F - actin at those sites as bright CypA puncta were evident at areas with diminished actin signal ( Fig . 5 . 1A ) . As membrane ruffles are highly dynamic motile structures , we used live cell imaging to better understand the recruitment characteristics of CypA in relation to F - actin at the 184 structures . To do this we co - transfected HeLa cells with mKate - LifeAct and GFP - CypA and found that CypA was recruited to ruffles at essentially the same time as F - actin ( Movie . 5 . 1 ) . The majority of CypA colocalized with actin as the ruffles formed , suggesting CypA redistribution within the structures could be linked to the polymerization of F - actin . Localized cytoskeletal remodeling and subsequent membrane ruffling required for S . Typhimurium entry into cells is triggered by the injection of an array of T3SS effectors 609 , 610 , 614 , 724 , 725 . To investigate the requirement of these effectors for CypA recruitment , we utilized S . Typhimurium T3SS effector mutants . The T3SS effector SipA is not essential for ruffle formation but enhances bacterial invasion rates through its ability to bundle actin as well as inhibit actin depolymerization 614 – 616 , 728 . To determine if SipA is necessary for CypA recruitment to membrane ruffles , we immunolocalized CypA in cells infected with a S . Typhimurium  sipA mutant . During these infections we found that there was no observable change in the localization characteristics as compared to the wild - type infections ( Fig . 5 . 1A ) . The S . Typhimurium effectors ( SopB , SopE and SopE2 ) are involved in the activation of cellular Rho GTPases that cause the dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling at the membrane during bacterial invasion events 609 , 610 , 724 , 725 . To assess if CypA recruitment at bacterial attachment sites depends on membrane ruffle formation or simply bacterial attachment , we utilized a S . Typhimurium mutant lacking the abovementioned effectors 729 and found that CypA was absent from bacterial contact sites ( Fig . 5 . 1A ) . 5 . 3 . 2 . Cyclophilin A regulates host cell invasion by S . Typhimurium To investigate the functional importance of CypA during S . Typhimurium invasion we utilized a mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line deficient in CypA 722 . We initially immunolocalized CypA in the parental wild - type ( CypA + / + ) MEFs and found a similar staining pattern as observed previously ( Fig . 5 . 1B ) . Gentamicin protection assays were then run on the wild - type and CypA null MEFs to enumerate the number of intracellular bacteria during the infections . Surprisingly , we found a 5 . 7 - fold increase in the number of bacteria internalized in CypA depleted cells as compared to those in wild - type cells ( Fig . 5 . 1C ) . Collectively , these data suggest a surprising outcome whereby CypA expression restricts bacterial entry into host cells . 185 5 . 3 . 3 . Cyclophilin A is a novel component of lamellipodia We have shown that CypA , a stimulator of eukaryotic cell motility 300 , is also a novel component of actin - rich membrane ruffles generated during S . Typhimurium infections . As these highly motile structures are enriched with actin filaments , we wanted to examine whether CypA was also present at the branched F - actin - containing leading edge of motile eukaryotic cells . To do this , we fixed and immunolocalized CypA in actively spreading Ptk2 cells ; a highly motile epithelial cell line with easily observable lamellipodia . Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of these cells showed an enrichment of CypA puncta at those sites whereas primary antibody controls lacked that localization ( Fig . 5 . 2 ) . 5 . 3 . 4 . Cyclophilin A is dispensable for attaching and effacing bacteria EPEC and EHEC are bacterial pathogens that hijack the actin cytoskeleton of their host’s cells , causing actin - rich structures called pedestals at sites of bacterial adherence 594 . In a previous study we identified CypA as a novel component of isolated EPEC pedestals and demonstrated CypA at pedestals during infections with an attenuated strain of EPEC referred to as JPN15 646 . As this strain does not possess bundle - forming pili ( BFP ) which normally induces microcolonies on the surface of host epithelia , we sought to determine whether that localization was strain dependent . Using a strain of BFP positive WT EPEC ( 2348 / 69 ) we found CypA enriched within the actin cores of pedestals ( Fig . 5 . 3A ) . To ascertain whether CypA recruitment occurs simply as result of bacterial contact onto the host cell surface or because of the translocation of injected effectors , we infected cultured cells with the EPEC ( 2348 / 69 ) Δ escN mutant which is unable to translocate T3SS effectors or form pedestals . When we examined regions of bacterial adherence to the host during these infections , we found no enrichment of CypA , indicating that recruitment of CypA requires a functional T3SS ( Fig . 5 . 3A ) . Firm attachment by EPEC depends on the translocation of the bacterial effector Tir directly into the host cell and its embedding in the host plasma membrane 593 . As EPEC mutants lacking tir alone cannot generate pedestals 593 , we determined if CypA could still be recruited to sites of bacterial adherence . We opted to do this using the JPN15 strain of EPEC as pedestals are larger and more easily resolved using that strain . Using a JPN15 Δ tir strain , we found that CypA was absent from bacterial attachment sites indicating that translocated Tir plays a role in CypA recruitment ( Fig . 5 . 4A ) . When we used a JPN Δ tir 186 mutant complemented with tir ( Δ tir + tir ) , CypA was present at EPEC pedestals and was indistinguishable from the wild - type JPN15 infections ( Fig . 5 . 4A ) . EPEC pedestal formation also depends on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 474 of Tir , which ultimately results in the recruitment and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex 108 , 109 , 598 . To test whether the phosphorylation of this residue is crucial for CypA recruitment , we utilized a JPN15 Δ tir strain complemented with a Tir variant that is non - phosphorylatable at residue 474 ( Δ tir + tir Y474F ) . Immunolabeling of CypA revealed that Y474 is necessary for CypA recruitment at bacterial attachment sites ( Fig . 5 . 4A ) . Despite the altered localization of CypA during the infections , CypA expression remained unchanged as compared to uninfected controls ( Fig . 5 . 4B ) . Finally , we tested whether CypA expression itself is needed for EPEC pedestal formation . We infected wild - type and CypA null cells with EPEC ( JPN15 ) and found that EPEC pedestals were still generated ( Fig . 5 . 4C ) . While EPEC and EHEC both generate actin - rich pedestals during their infections , each pathogen utilizes different molecular pathways to form pedestals 730 . To test if CypA is also a component of EHEC pedestals , we infected cultured cells with wild - type EHEC and stained fixed cells with CypA targeting antibodies . CypA was present at those pedestals , however the staining intensity was noticeably decreased as compared to EPEC pedestals ( Fig . 5 . 5 ) . 5 . 4 . Discussion In this study we demonstrate that motile actin - rich structures generated by bacterial pathogens as well as those that occur normally during cell motility are highly enriched with CypA . Our most striking discovery occurred during our examination of CypA during S . Typhimurium infections which revealed a potentially novel CypA - dependent regulatory mechanism of restricting bacterial entry . Among the array of T3SS effectors injected into host cells during S . Typhimurium infections a subset are responsible for the cytoskeletal rearrangements that cause membrane ruffling and thus bacterial internalization . We found that the abolishment of CypA increased , rather than decreased , bacterial invasion . One potential explanation for this may lie in S . Typhimurium effector dysfunction . We have previously demonstrated that 187 CypA directly interacts with and stabilizes N - WASp , a eukaryotic activator of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization 299 . This interaction depends on the GPXLP motif within N - WASp 299 . Remarkably , protein sequence analysis of the S . Typhimurium effector SipA uncovered the GPXLP motif within the protein . Curiously , we did not find observable defects in CypA recruitment to Δ sipA ruffles . SipA normally augments bacterial infection via two mechanisms , first by promoting efficient membrane ruffling and thus bacterial entry 614 , and second , by stimulating intracellular bacterial replication long after they enter cells via its presence at Salmonella - containing vacuoles ( SCVs ) 731 . Moreover , unlike SopB , SopE and SopE2 , SipA promotes ruffling through its ability to directly bind actin , induce F - actin polymerization and elongation as well as shield filaments from ADF / cofilin - mediated depolymerization 614 – 616 , 728 . Based on this information , we can envision two scenarios during these infections whereby dynamic CypA interaction with the GPXLP motif of SipA attenuates intracellular bacterial levels : 1 ) by impeding SipA - mediated actin polymerization or 2 ) by interfering with SipA at SCVs . As we observed increased bacterial loads during early infections we postulate that the former scenario was at play during our study . Several studies have provided strong evidence of a role for CypA in eukaryotic cell motility 299 , 300 . Here we show that endogenous CypA is present at the leading edge of motile cells , within the lamellipodia . This finding is line with recent work by Saleh and co - workers who showed that CypA can bind to CrkII to enhance cell motility 300 . Our finding of endogenous CypA at the leading edge of cells strengthens this point , as cell motility induced by CrkII signaling is mediated by plasma membrane integrin - paxillin docks 488 . In conclusion , we have shown that CypA is a component of motile actin - rich structures associated with the plasma membrane . Although CypA is not required for pedestal formation , our work demonstrates that CypA regulates bacterial loads during S . Typhimurium infections . The exact role this enzyme plays during these infections could have widespread applications for other pathogens that also hijack the actin cytoskeleton as part of their infectious processes . 188 5 . 5 . Materials and Methods 5 . 5 . 1 . Cell Culture Human cervical ( HeLa ) and Potorous tridactylus kidney ( Ptk2 ) epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ( numbers CCL - 2 and CCL - 56 respectively ) . CypA WT ( PPIA + / + ) and CypA KO ( PPIA - / - ) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells ( MEFs ) were generated previously 722 .

Typhimurium infections , overnight shaking cultures of the bacteria were subcultured at 37 °C ( with shaking ) in LB broth for 3 - 4 hours to activate the bacteria . Cultured cells in well plates were infected with a 1 : 100 dilution of the bacteria for 15 minutes to observe membrane ruffle formation . For EPEC and EHEC infections , overnight broth cultures were used to infect cultured cells in well plates at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 for 6 - 8 hours . 189 5 . 5 . 4 . Gentamicin Protection Assay Cultured cells in well plates were incubated with wild - type S . Typhimurium for 20 minutes to allow for bacterial invasion . Following this , well plates were washed 3X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS [ - / - ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and then cells were left to incubate for 1 hour in media containing 50 µg / ml gentamicin ( to kill extracellular bacteria ) . After the 1 hour , cells were rinsed 5X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline containing Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS [ + / + ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and intracellular bacteria released by treatment of cells with a 1 % solution of triton X - 100 ( made in PBS [ + / + ] ) for 5 minutes . After the 5 minute incubation , serial dilutions of the wells were performed in 96 well format assay blocks . Dilutions were selected ( so as to give a count of between 30 - 300 bacterial colonies ) , spread onto LB plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C prior to their enumeration . 5 . 5 . 5 .

Immunolocalization For immunofluorescence studies , cells were fixed at room temperature for 15 minutes using pre - warmed ( 37ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde ( made in 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM Na / K PO4 , 5 . 0 mM KCl , pH 7 . 3 ) and then washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] . Cells were treated with −20°C acetone for 10 minutes to permeabilize cells and then allowed to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes . Samples were then blocked with 5 % normal goat serum ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes after which samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies prepared in TPBS / BSA ( PBS [ - / - ] , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % 190 bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] ) . The following day , samples were washed 3X with TPBS / BSA and then treated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies ) at room temperature in the dark for 2 hours . To visualize F - actin , samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes . Samples were rinsed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] and then mounted onto glass slides using Prolong Diamond antifade mountant containing DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . 5 . 5 . 7 . Lysate Preparation and Western Blotting Lysates were prepared by washing cultured cells 3X with pre - warmed PBS [ + / + ] then treating the cells with ice - chilled RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid , 10 % SDS ) with cOmplete™ Mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) on ice for 5 minutes . Cells were scraped and lysates collected into microcentrifuge tubes . The lysates were spun at 4°C and 10 , 000 g for 10 minutes to pellet cellular debris . Top supernatants were collected into fresh microcentrifuge tubes and immediately stored at −80°C following flash freezing in liquid nitrogen . Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay kit ( Pierce ) . For Western blotting , lysates samples were first prepared in 6X Laemmli buffer then boiled for 10 minutes . Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and subsequently resolved by electrophoresis . Following protein separation , gels were rinsed in water for 5 minutes and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot® SD semi - dry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . Post transfer , membranes were washed for 5 minutes in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) , blocked with 4 % Blotto ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( made in TBST ) and then incubated with primary antibodies ( diluted in TBST , 1 % BSA ) overnight at 4°C . The next day , membranes were rinsed 3X with TBST for 10 minutes each prior to incubating with secondary antibodies ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) for 1 hour at room temperature . To visualize protein bands , membranes were treated with Western Lightning Plus - ECL ( PerkinElmer ) following the manufacturer’s instructions and imaged using a Fujifilm LAS - 4000 imager ( Fujifilm ) . To confirm equal loading , membranes were stripped of bound antibodies using mild stripping buffer ( 1 . 5 % glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 2 . 2 ) and re - probed as described above using the mouse anti - α  tubulin antibody . 191 5 . 5 . 8 .

Abstract Efficient cell - to - cell transfer of Listeria monocytogenes ( L . monocytogenes ) requires the proper formation of actin - rich membrane protrusions . To date , only the host proteins ezrin , the binding partner of ezrin , CD44 , as well as cyclophilin A ( CypA ) have been identified as crucial components for L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion stabilization and thus efficient cell - to - cell movement of the microbes . Here we examine the classical binding partner of CypA , CD147 , and find that this membrane protein is also hijacked by the bacteria for their cellular dissemination . CD147 is enriched at the plasma membrane surrounding the membrane protrusions as well as the resulting invaginations generated in neighboring cells . In cells depleted of CD147 , these actin - rich structures appear similar to those generated in CypA depleted cells as they are significantly shorter and more contorted as compared to their straighter counterparts formed in wild - type control cells . The presence of malformed membrane protrusions hampers the ability of L . monocytogenes to efficiently disseminate from CD147 depleted cells . Our findings uncover another important host protein needed for L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation and efficient microbial dissemination . 6 . 2 . Introduction Listeria monocytogenes ( L . monocytogenes ) is an invasive food - borne bacterial pathogen that is the causative agent of listeriosis ; an infection with 20 - 30 % mortality rates 488 . The strategies used by L . monocytogenes to cause disease often arise from the microbes hijacking their host’s subcellular machinery 493 . The host actin cytoskeleton is a crucial target for L . monocytogenes and is controlled during their invasion into , and movement within ( and amongst ) host cells 105 , 493 , 496 , 673 . Movement within the cytoplasm of their host cells is accomplished through their generation of actin - rich structures called comet / rocket tails 493 , 732 . During comet / rocket tail formation , the N - WASp mimicking bacterial surface protein ActA binds to and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex where branched actin filaments ( F - actin ) provide the propulsive force necessary for motility 52 . Movement of L . monocytogenes amongst host cells occurs when motile bacteria engage the host cell periphery resulting in the formation of modified comet / rocket tails that protrude from the cell and are sheathed by plasma membrane 493 . These actin - rich membrane protrusions 201 interact with corresponding invaginations in neighbouring cells which ultimately enable L . monocytogenes to spread from one cell to another . We have recently shown that the eukaryotic prolyl cis - trans isomerase , cyclophilin A ( CypA ) , is hijacked by L . monocytogenes exclusively at membrane protrusions 701 . CypA is essential for their structural integrity , as cells depleted of CypA form membrane protrusions that are morphologically deformed 701 . Importantly , malformed membrane protrusions cause a reduction in L . monocytogenes cell - to - cell spreading . This uncommon phenotype is also observed with inhibition of the ERM family protein ezrin and its binding partner CD44 249 . To further tease out cellular components involved in the formation of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions , we set out to examine known CypA binding partners that associate with both the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton . We identified the eukaryotic plasma membrane protein CD147 ; a well - known binding partner of secreted CypA , as a candidate to study during L . monocytogenes infections 301 . CD147 expression promotes proper cytoskeletal organization 318 as well as focal adhesion 733 , lamellipodium 317 , 319 , 733 and invadopodium 320 formation in vitro . Recent evidence also highlights a unique cytoskeletal - associated role of CD147 in organizing protrusive actin - rich structures generated during Neisseria meningitidis ( N . meningitidis ) infections of endothelial cells 325 . Here we demonstrate that CD147 is a key host cell membrane protein that influences the cell - to - cell transfer of L . monocytogenes . 6 . 3 . Results 6 . 3 . 1 . CD147 Is Recruited to L . monocytogenes Actin - Rich Membrane Protrusions and Corresponding Invaginations To investigate the potential involvement of CD147 during the intracellular motility and cell - to - cell spreading of L . monocytogenes , we immunolocalized CD147 in HeLa cells infected with wild type L . monocytogenes . Immunostaining of these cells revealed CD147 at the plasma membrane surrounding L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions as well as particularly intense CD147 localization as clusters at the plasma membrane where motile bacteria had just begun to protrude outwards from the host cell ( Fig 6 . 1A , B ) . Staining was not present within the actin - rich core of the membrane protrusions or at 202 cytoplasmic comet / rocket tails ( Fig 6 . 1A , B ) . Primary antibody controls using normal mouse IgG in place of the anti - CD147 antibody did not concentrate at those sites . ( Fig 6 . 4A ) . To ensure that an abnormal accumulation of the plasma membrane itself was not the cause of the observed increase in CD147 localization , we transfected cells with a fluorescent plasma membrane marker ( pmKate2 - f - mem ) , then infected the cells with L . monocytogenes . In those cells we noticed that while the plasma membrane marker delineated the membrane at the L . monocytogenes protrusions , it did not increase , as was the case at other actin - rich membranous structures ( membrane ruffles or filopodial extensions ) ( Fig 6 . 4C ) . To test whether the presence of CD147 at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions was applicable in other cell types or was a cell - type specific observation , we infected human intestinal epithelial ( Caco - 2 ) cells with L . monocytogenes and stained fixed samples with anti - CD147 antibodies . CD147 was again enriched at the plasma membrane at sites of bacterial spreading from one cell to another ( Fig 6 . 5 ) . Because CD147 is a transmembrane receptor that homotypically associates with CD147 molecules on neighboring cells 734 , we examined whether CD147 was concentrated at the corresponding plasma membrane of invaginations at sites of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion contact . To do this we infected wild - type cells with L . monocytogenes then mixed them with GFP - CD147 transfected cells and observed GFP - CD147 surrounding L . monocytogenes - containing invaginations in the GFP - CD147 positive membrane protrusion receiving cells ( Fig 6 . 1C - top ) . GFP - CD147 was also enriched at the plasma membrane surrounding the membrane protrusions generated from GFP - CD147 cells when we performed the reverse experiments ( Fig 6 . 1C - bottom ) . As a control we performed the same experiments using the GFP empty vector in place of GFP - CD147 and saw that GFP on its own was not present at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions or their corresponding invaginations ( Fig 6 . 4B ) . Upon the interaction of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions with the corresponding invaginations of neighboring cells , we noticed a dramatic increase in endogenous CD147 signal ( detected by antibody staining ) . We presume this was due to the localization of proteins from both the membrane protrusion and invagination fluorescing in the same localized area ( Fig 6 . 1D ) . We examined similar contact sites using normal mouse IgG in place of the anti - CD147 antibody and did not see a concentration of the signal at those sites . ( Fig 6 . 4A ) . We then determined the frequency of endogenous CD147 redistribution at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions and saw that there was an increase in CD147 203 fluorescence intensity at ~ 99 % of the structures ( 68 membrane protrusion quantified over 3 independent experiments ) ( Fig 6 . 1E ) . When we quantified the frequency of increased GFP - CD147 signal at corresponding invaginations , we saw that 100 % of the structures were enriched with GFP - CD147 ( 37 membrane protrusion invaginations quantified over 3 independent experiments ) ( Fig 6 . 1F ) . The altered localization of CD147 in infected cells did not result in a change in protein levels when compared to uninfected cells ( Fig 6 . 1G ) . We also performed infections using a L . monocytogenes actA - deletion mutant , which is unable to generate F - actin networks at its surface and is thus non - motile . We found that CD147 did not recruit to the vicinity of those bacteria ( Fig 6 . 6 ) . 6 . 3 . 2 . CD147 is Required for the Proper Formation of L . monocytogenes Actin - Rich Membrane Protrusions . To determine the functional role of CD147 at bacterially - induced actin - rich structures generated during L . monocytogenes infections , we depleted CD147 in HeLa cells using siRNA ( Fig 6 . 7A ) . Western blot analysis of depleted cells resulted in a ~ 90 % reduction in CD147 protein levels when compared to cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA ( Fig 6 . 7B ) . Till and colleagues ( 2008 ) previously demonstrated that CD147 was used by L . monocytogenes for efficient internalization into HEK293 ( kidney epithelial ) cells . Depletion of CD147 within those cells caused a ~ 2 - fold decrease in intracellular bacterial loads 315 . Here we examined whether a similar invasion defect would arise in siRNA treated HeLa cells . We utilized immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify L . monocytogenes invasion by enumerating the proportion of intracellular bacteria versus total bacteria ( extracellular and intracellular ) contained within host cells that had undetectable levels of CD147 . We found a ~ 50 % reduction in the levels of internalized bacteria in cells depleted of CD147 as compared to cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA ( Fig 6 . 2A ) . As CD147 was absent from comet / rocket tails ( Fig 6 . 1A3 , 6 . 1B3 ) , it was not surprising that the comet / rocket tails appeared indistinguishable between CD147 depleted cells and cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA ( Fig 6 . 7C ) . To examine comet / rocket tails in more detail we examined the lengths and tortuosity ( a measure of comet / rocket tail distortedness ) of the structures generated in cells treated with CD147 - targeting or with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA . In both treatments we found no significant differences in the length or tortuosity of comet / rocket tails 204 generated in cells that expressed wild - type or depleted levels of CD147 ( Fig 6 . 2B , C ) . Additionally , we saw no significant shifts to the proportions of short ( < 5 µm ) , medium ( 5 - < 10 µm and 10 - < 15 µm ) and long ( 15 µm ) comet / rocket tails ( Fig 6 . 2D ) . CD147 depletion in L . monocytogenes infected cells resulted in morphologically deformed membrane protrusions when compared to their counterparts in cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA ( Fig 6 . 2E , F ) . The morphologically altered membrane protrusions resembled those generated in CypA - / - cells 701 . Similar CD147 localization patterns and phenotypic alterations to L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions were observed during immunolocalization and siRNA experiments conducted in SKOV3 and A549 cell lines ( Fig 6 . 8A , B ) . Because these structures are crucial in allowing L . monocytogenes to spread amongst host cells , we studied in greater detail the effect that CD147 depletion had on their length and tortuosity . When we measured the length of membrane protrusions , we found that depletion of CD147 resulted in significantly shorter structures ( Fig 6 . 2G ) . We also noted a significant increase in the tortuosity of membrane protrusions as they were severely contorted in CD147 depleted cells compared to their straighter counterparts in control cells ( Fig 6 . 2H , I ) . In cells depleted of CD147 , L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions became more distorted as they became longer ( Fig 6 . 2J ) . We previously showed that misshaped L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions generated in CypA knock - out ( KO ) cells retained the membrane - cytoskeletal linker ezrin within the actin - rich core of the structures 701 . Thus , we looked for the presence of endogenous ezrin at the deformed L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions generated in cells that were treated with CD147 - targeting siRNA . Again , we saw that ezrin was present at high levels at the structures ( Fig 6 . 9A - C ) as well as at morphologically sound membrane protrusions generated in cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA ( Fig 6 . 9A , B ) . Our observation that CD147 depletion phenocopies the resulting contorted membrane protrusions generated in CypA KO cells 701 prompted us to investigate the distribution of the two proteins at the structures . We initially examined the progression of endogenous CD147 together with CypA from the initiation of membrane protrusion formation through to maturity in order to determine whether the proteins colocalized to the same regions at the membrane protrusions . At the earliest stage of protrusion formation where the bacterium has just contacted the host cell plasma membrane , CD147 was found at one 205 pole of the bacterium , whereas CypA was present as a single intense zone at the opposite pole of L . monocytogenes , adjacent to the host cell cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 . 10 , box 1 ) . Increased presence of both proteins continued with CD147 enriched around the entire top of the bacterial cell at regions where the host cell plasma membrane envelops the bacterium , while CypA was enriched at the opposite pole of the bacterium where the actin - rich comet / rocket tail originates ( Fig . 6 . 10 , box 2 ) . Once the actin comet / rocket tail had pushed the bacterium outwards causing the plasma membrane to protrude further , CypA localized within the actin - rich core of the structure while CD147 continued to be recruited around the entire membrane of the L . monocytogenes protrusion ( Fig . 6 . 10 , box 3 ) . This localization continued until the point where the membrane protrusion extended far from the host cell body ( Fig . 6 . 10 , boxes 4 - 6 ) . Although some signal mixing could be detected at the actin - core / plasma membrane interface ( yellow signal ) , intermixing of the two signals was prominent at zones where the structures narrowed ( Fig . 6 . 10 , boxes 5 - 6 ) . Next , we wanted to investigate regions of CD147 that could be involved with 1 ) the stabilization of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions and 2 ) the potential recruitment of CypA to the structures . To do this we treated infected cells with a CD147 blocking antibody ( called MEM - M6 / 1 ) that targets the N - terminal Ig domain of the protein 735 , 736 . We added the CD147 blocking antibody ( vs normal mouse IgG [ control ] ) to wild - type host cells 2 hours post infection and allowed the infections to proceed for an additional 5 hours to observe membrane protrusions . In samples treated with the CD147 blocking antibody , collapsed membrane protrusions that failed to extend outward from the cell were evident whereas samples treated with normal mouse IgG had membrane protrusions that appeared indistinguishable from wild - type protrusions ( Fig 6 . 11A , B ) . When we performed immunostaining of the CD147 antibody blocked samples against CD147 or CypA , both proteins were recruited to the membrane protrusions ( Fig 6 . 11A , B ) . To study any potential CD147 - CypA interactions that might be at play within membrane protrusions , we transfected cells with a fluorescently - tagged variant of CD147 mutated at its extracellular / membrane CypA binding site ( GFP - CD147 - P211A ) 737 . We found that this mutant of CD147 continued to localize to membrane protrusions and to the corresponding invaginations similarly to cells expressing wild type GFP - CD147 ( Fig 6 . 12A ) . Filamentous actin and CypA localization also appeared unchanged at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions in the GFP - CD147 - P211A expressing cells ( Fig 6 . 12A , B ) . This data is 206 consistent with our observation that depletion of either CD147 or CypA results in the opposing protein maintaining its presence within the structures ( Fig 6 . 12C , D ) . Recent findings by Maïssa and colleagues uncover a novel actin - associated role for CD147 in organizing actin - rich membrane protrusions generated during N . meningitidis infections 325 . The authors identified a crucial protrusion stabilizing function of CD147 that is dependent on the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of CD147 and the cytosolic actin crosslinking and bundling protein  - actinin 4 . Because membrane protrusions generated by N . meningitidis and L . monocytogenes share similar characteristics , we set out to examine whether  - actinin 4 , is also hijacked by L . monocytogenes at their membrane protrusions . Immunostaining of infected HeLa cells against  - actinin 4 revealed an enrichment of the protein within the actin - rich core of the structures ( Fig 6 . 13A ) . We also found that  - actinin 4 localized to actin clouds as well as throughout the comet / rocket tails ( Fig 6 . 13B ) . 6 . 3 . 3 . CD147 Promotes L . monocytogenes Cell - to - Cell Spreading . The malformation of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions suggests that CD147 likely influences the ability of the microbes to spread amongst neighboring cells . To test this , we adapted a previously developed assay that relies on the identification of L . monocytogenes foci of infection ( bacteria immunolabelled using anti - L . monocytogenes antibodies ) and post analysis ( thresholding and delineation ) of these regions to measure the area of infection 539 ) . We measured at least 40 thresholded and delineated foci ( containing all bacteria ) from samples treated with CD147 - targeting or non - targeting [ control ] siRNA . We ensured that foci imaged from depleted samples contained exclusively cells with undetectable levels of CD147 ( Fig 6 . 14 ) . We calculated close to a 50 % reduction ( compared to controls ) in the area of infection when CD147 was depleted in cells ( Fig 6 . 3A , B ) . Because of potential variability in the size of the host cells within the infection foci , we enumerated the number of infected cells per foci . Relative to samples treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA , there was a significant ~ 50 % decrease in the number of infected cells per foci in the absence of CD147 . This suggests that our previous observations of the foci area spreading defects are unlikely a result of abnormal changes in the physical size of infected host cells ( Fig 6 . 3C ) . We also examined L . monocytogenes 207 cell - to - cell spreading using the SKOV3 cell line and saw a significant reduction in the area of infection when CD147 was depleted in those cells ( Fig 6 . 3D , E ) . Shigella flexneri is another invasive bacterial pathogen that becomes motile within host cells using comet / rocket tails and ultimately spreads amongst cells through the generation of actin - rich membranous protrusions 738 . Despite the morphological and functional similarities between membrane protrusions generated by L . monocytogenes and S . flexneri , the extent of shared molecular constituents that make up both structures likely remains incomplete . Thus , to examine whether CD147 was also a component of S . flexneri membrane protrusions we immunolocalized CD147 in HeLa cells infected with wild - type S . flexneri . Immunostaining of these samples showed a noticeable increase in CD147 intensity at the plasma membrane of the structures ( Fig 6 . 15A ) . Cell - to - cell spreading assays showed a significant ~ 25 % reduction in the average number of infected cells per foci when CD147 was depleted from cells ( Fig 6 . 15B ) , suggesting that CD147 is a host factor required by multiple pathogens that disseminate from one cell to another using actin - rich membrane protrusions . 6 . 4 . Discussion In this study we demonstrate a new role for the transmembrane glycoprotein , CD147 , as a crucial component in the cell - to - cell spreading machinery of both L . monocytogenes and S . flexneri . Our findings demonstrate that collapsed membrane protrusions generated in cells depleted of CD147 phenocopies the loss of its classical binding partner CypA 701 . The alteration to either of these proteins results in morphological changes to the membrane protrusions as well as defects in the cell - to - cell transfer of the bacteria . Although defects in cell - to - cell spreading has also been seen with ezrin / CD44 studies 249 , our finding that ezrin maintains its localization within L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions when CD147 is depleted suggests that ezrin / CD44 is acting independently of CD147 and CypA during bacterial dissemination . In our analysis we found that depletion of CD147 caused L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions to become significantly shorter and contorted . The same phenotypes occurred 208 in our previous study when L . monocytogenes was used to infect CypA KO cells 701 . This is in contrast to other studies where cells transfected with truncated forms of CD44 or a constitutively inactive variant of ezrin caused the proximal regions of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions to thicken , distort and shorten considerably 249 . We did not find any evident morphological changes to L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions when CD147 ( or CypA 701 ) was overexpressed . As we investigated CD147 - CypA interactions more deeply during L . monocytogenes infections , many of our findings suggested that this protein pair are likely not interacting in their classical manner at the bacterial membrane protrusions . One would predict that if CypA was interacting with CD147 , CypA would delineate the membrane protrusions similarly to the CD147 immunostaining pattern . However , this was not the case as our colocalization experiments showed that CD147 and CypA largely occupy different locations within the membrane protrusions ; CypA is within the core of the structures while CD147 is enriched at the surrounding plasma membrane . Additionally , expression of CD147 containing a mutation in the CypA binding site of CD147 did not affect the formation of membrane protrusions nor the recruitment of endogenous CypA to the structures . Our demonstration that CD147 or CypA maintained their localization at collapsed membrane protrusions when the opposing protein was depleted in cells together with our previous study showing that extracellular CypA is incapable of restoring the normal morphology of collapsed membrane protrusions generated in CypA KO cells 701 supports this conclusion . Although the depletion of either CD147 or CypA cause membrane protrusions to collapse in morphologically similar manners , there is a lack of published findings linking CD147 to CypA within the cytoplasm . So , what could be going on ? We postulate that one mechanism behind the CD147 - and CypA - mediated morphological stabilization of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions may involve both proteins interacting separately with the actin - crosslinking proteins within the structures . In fact , Maïssa and colleagues’ study of N . meningitidis infections identified a novel link between CD147 and the actin cytoskeleton at N . meningitidis membrane protrusions 325 . The authors use of an immunoprecipitation and nano - liquid chromatography tandem - mass spectrometry screen for CD147 binding partners identified several actin - binding and crosslinking proteins . Of the novel CD147 binding partners ,  - actinin 4 was further investigated and shown to stabilize N . meningitidis membrane protrusions via its direct interaction with the cytoplasmic tail region of CD147 . Our finding of  - actinin 4 within the core of L . 209 monocytogenes membrane protrusions suggests a potentially similar mechanism to the one used during N . meningitidis infections whereby the cytosolic region of CD147 recruits  - actinin 4 in order to stabilize the actin filaments within the membrane protrusions . As CypA itself does not possess any known actin - binding motifs and its PPIase activity is dispensable during L . monocytogenes infections , its precise mechanistic role at membrane protrusions will require further investigation . Given that there are some similarities in the overall deficiencies of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions when either CD147 or ezrin / CD44 are altered , is it possible that these proteins interact at the structures ? Evidence for this may lie in the involvement of CD147 at other actin - associated structures . Expression of CD147 in eukaryotic cells is involved in controlling the formation and proper functioning of actin - rich lamellipodia and invadopodia 317 , 319 , 320 , 733 . A crucial component of invadopodia formation involves lipid raft signalling . Grass and colleagues demonstrated a role for CD147 together with CD44 at those sites to promote proper invadopodia activity 312 . Consequently , a mechanism behind L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation / stabilization could involve CD147 working together with CD44 to ultimately regulate and organize F - actin within the structures , whether through ezrin ,  - actinin 4 or other actin - associated components . We found that the cell - to - cell transfer of L . monocytogenes amongst CD147 siRNA treated cells was decreased by ~ 2 fold . Significant decreases in intercellular spreading also held true when tested in multiple cell lines as well as when host cells were infected with S . flexneri . Although not enumerated , alterations in bacterial cell - to - cell spreading were qualitatively assessed by others when an inactive ezrin variant or CD44 domains were overexpressed in L . monocytogenes infected monolayers 249 . Pust and co - workers ( 2005 ) noted in their ezrin / CD44 work that L . monocytogenes could infect at the edges of those monolayers , but that “ Listeria did not infect the cells in the centre of a cellular islet” 249 . Whether those observed results were in fact due to a perturbation in bacterial spreading or a decrease in initial bacterial entry ( invasion ) is questionable as Jung and colleagues demonstrated a crucial role for CD44 and ezrin in the initial uptake of L . monocytogenes into non - phagocytic host cells 739 . Although our study and work done by others suggests that CD147 promotes efficient bacterial invasion into target host cells 315 , our intercellular spreading assays were specifically designed to study the cell - to - cell spread of L . monocytogenes into their neighboring cells . Furthermore , while we focused primarily on the pathogenesis of L . monocytogenes , our observation of defective bacterial spreading 210 using S . flexneri demonstrates that CD147 is a host protein accessed by multiple microbes during their disease processes 325 , 346 , 740 . A dearth of studies has failed to identify any proteins present on the invaginations that receive the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions in neighbouring cells . Thus , our discovery of CD147 concentrated on both the membrane protrusions and their corresponding invaginations was of particular interest . CD147 binds homotypically with CD147 molecules on neighbouring cells 734 . We postulate that these interactions may serve to strengthen the efficiency of bacterial internalization ultimately through a pulling / endocytic event acting on the receiving cell in conjunction with the pushing forces transmitted by the actin comet / rocket tails of the protruding bacterial structures . In summary , we have demonstrated that CD147 is critical for the proper formation and function of L . monocytogenes and S . flexneri membrane protrusions . The novel role that this transmembrane glycoprotein plays at these membrane protrusions ( and the corresponding invaginations ) could have broad applications to various motile membrane - associated actin - rich structures generated by cells as well as other disease - causing microbial pathogens . 6 . 5 .

CypA KO ( PPIA - / - ) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells ( MEFs ) 722 and HeLa cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing high glucose ( Hyclone , GE Healthcare ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . A549 cells were cultured using Ham’s F - 12K ( Kaighns’s ) medium ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) supplemented with 10 % FBS . Caco - 2 cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing high glucose ( Hyclone , GE Healthcare ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 1 % non - essential amino acids ( Hyclone , GE Healthcare ) . SKOV3 cells ( ATCC catalog number HTB - 77 ) were cultured using DMEM : nutrient mixture F - 12 ( DMEM / F - 12 ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 10 % FBS . 211 All cell lines were maintained in a cell culture incubator ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) . To seed cells for experiments , cells growing in plastic culture flasks were first rinsed 3X with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline without Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( PBS [ - / - ] ) ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , trypsinized with 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) then seeded onto clear polystyrene 6 - well or 24 - well format plates ( Corning ) containing glass coverslips . 6 . 5 . 2 . Bacterial strains and growth conditions The bacterial strains used were L . monocytogenes strains EGD BUG 600 ( wild - type and Δ actA ) ( gifted by Dr . Pascale Cossart ) and S . flexneri ( serotype 5a strain M90T ) . L . monocytogenes bacteria were grown at 37°C using brain heart infusion ( BHI ) agar or broth ( BD Biosciences ) . S . flexneri bacteria were grown initially on LB agar ( LBA , BD Biosciences ) containing 0 . 01 % Congo red ( Ricca Chemical Company ) at 37°C in order to obtain red coloured colonies ( indicative of virulent bacteria ) . Red coloured S . flexneri colonies were subcultured using LB broth ( BD Biosciences ) . 6 . 5 . 3 . Listeria monocytogenes infections To infect cultured cells , overnight shaken broth cultures of L . monocytogenes were diluted 10X in BHI broth ( final volume of 10 mL ) and then incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator ( on an angle ) until A600 = 1 . 00 . At A600 = 1 . 00 , 1 mL of bacteria were spun down for 5 minutes at 10 , 000 rpm ( 25°C ) and washed 2x with pre - warmed ( 37°C ) PBS [ - / - ] . Pelleted bacteria were re - suspended with 1 mL of pre - warmed serum - free media ( DMEM , Kaighns’s or DMEM / F - 12 ; 37°C ) then diluted 100X . Diluted bacteria were added onto culture plates containing host cells and incubated for at least 6 - 7 hours to study comet / rocket tail and actin - rich membrane protrusion / invagination formation . 6 . 5 . 4 . Shigella flexneri infections To infect cultured cells , a single red colony ( grown on LBA + 0 . 01 % Congo red ) was inoculated into 2 mL of LB broth for 18 hours at 37°C ( with shaking ) . 18 hour cultures were diluted 50 fold into 5 mL of LB broth and shaken for an additional 2 hours at 37°C . For intercellular spreading assays , optical density readings were performed following the 2 hour subcultures such that all replicate experiments were performed with bacteria grown 212 to the same optical density . Bacteria were then added onto culture plates containing host cells and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour . After 1 hour , cells were rinsed 5X with pre - warmed sterile PBS [ - / - ] and then left in media containing gentamicin ( 50 μg / mL ) . Infections were fixed between 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 hours in order to examine membrane protrusions . 6 . 5 . 5 .

The mouse monoclonal anti - ezrin antibody 120 ( CPTC - Ezrin - 1 ) was deposited to the DSHB by Clinical Proteomics Technologies for Cancer . 6 . 5 . 6 . Immunolocalization For immunofluorescence studies , cells attached to glass coverslips were fixed in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes using pre - warmed ( 37ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde ( prepared in 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM Na / K PO4 , 5 . 0 mM KCl , pH 7 . 3 ) and then rinsed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] . Cells were permeabilized at room temperate for 5 minutes using 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] and used at room temperature ) or at −20°C for 10 minutes while submerged in a - 20°C acetone bath . Following Triton X - 100 treatment , coverslips were rinsed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] , whereas acetone treated coverslips were left to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes . All samples were then blocked at room temperature with 5 % normal goat serum ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes after which samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies prepared in 213 TPBS / BSA ( PBS [ - / - ] , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] ) . Following this , samples were washed 3X with TPBS / BSA for 10 minutes and then treated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 594 - or 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ; prepared in TPBS / BSA ) at room temperature in the dark for 2 hours . To visualize F - actin , samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 - , 488 - or 350 - conjugated phalloidin ( prepared in PBS [ - / - ] ) for 20 minutes . Samples were washed 3X with PBS [ - / - ] and mounted onto glass microscope slides using the Prolong Diamond antifade mounting medium either with or without DAPI ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . We considered a protein “enriched” at a specific area if the observed staining signal intensity was higher at that site ( or at that structure ) when compared to other regions of the cell in general and was also absent in controls . 6 . 5 . 7 . Lysate preparation and Western blotting Lysates were prepared by washing cells in culture well plates 3X with pre - warmed PBS [ + / + ] and then treating with ice - chilled RIPA lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % deoxycholic acid , 10 % SDS ) containing a cOmplete™ Mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) on ice for 5 minutes . Cells were disrupted using cell scrapers and lysates collected into microcentrifuge tubes . Lysates were spun at 4°C and 10 , 000 g for 10 minutes to pellet cellular debris and DNA ; supernatants were collected into new pre - chilled microcentrifuge tubes and immediately stored at −80°C . Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay kit ( Pierce ) . For Western blotting , lysates samples were first prepared in 6X Laemmli buffer then boiled ( 100°C ) for 10 minutes . Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and resolved by electrophoresis . Following protein separation , gels were rinsed in water for 5 minutes and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot® SD semi - dry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . After the transfer , the membranes were washed for 5 minutes in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) with shaking , blocked with shaking for 1 hour with 4 % Blotto ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) prepared in TBST and then treated with primary antibodies ( diluted in TBST , 1 % BSA ) overnight at 4°C . The next day , membranes were rinsed 3X with TBST for 10 minutes each prior to incubating with secondary antibodies ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Membranes were treated with Western Lightning Plus - ECL ( PerkinElmer ) following the manufacturer’s instructions 214 and protein bands were visualized using a Fujifilm LAS - 4000 imager ( Fujifilm ) . To confirm equal loading , membranes were stripped of bound antibodies with mild stripping buffer ( 1 . 5 % glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 2 . 2 ) and re - probed using the mouse anti - α tubulin targeting antibody . 6 . 5 . 8 . DNA constructs DNA plasmids encoding GFP - CD147 , GFP - CD147 - P211A and the respective empty GFP vectors were generated previously 737 , 737 . The DNA plasmid encoding pmKate2 - f - mem ( cat no . FP186 ) was purchased from Evrogen . 6 . 5 . 9 . CD147 RNAi knockdown A smart pool ( ON - Targetplus siRNA ) of 4 CD147 siRNA ( L - 010737 - 00 - 0005 ) and 4 non - targeting control ( Ctrl ) siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon ( GE Healthcare ) . Transfections were performed using the siRNA transfection reagent INTERFERin ( Polyplus transfection ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , 0 . 1 mL of serum - free media containing 50 nM siRNA duplexes and INTERFERin was added to cells contained in clear polystyrene 24 well culture plates . To obtain cells with undetectable levels of CD147 protein , cells required a 96 hour incubation period following the siRNA treatment . 6 . 5 . 10 . Cell culture transfections All DNA transfections of cultured cells were performed using jetPEI or jetPRIME transfection reagents ( Polyplus Transfection ) and carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cells were transfected ( 3μL reagent and 1 . 5μg plasmid DNA per well [ 6 well plate ] ) and then incubated at 37°C for 4 hours . Following the 4 hour incubation , media in the wells was replaced and the cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C to allow for expression of the respective gene product . Transfected cells were fixed ( 3 % paraformaldehyde ) for viewing by immunofluorescence microscopy . 215 6 . 5 . 11 . Listeria monocytogenes invasion assay ( microscopy counts ) CD147 was knocked - down in HeLa cells ( in 24 well plates ) using siRNA . 96 hours post incubation with CD147 ( or non - targeting [ control ] ) siRNA duplexes , cells were infected with wild - type L . monocytogenes . L . monocytogenes infections were rinsed 5X after 2 hours using pre - warmed PBS [ + / + ] then 1 mL of pre - warmed DMEM containing 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 μg / mL ) was added to each infected well to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . Cells were fixed 3 hours post infection . To label extracellular bacteria , samples were treated with rabbit anti - Listeria monocytogenes and Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies as described above except Tween - 20 was absent from all treatments . On the same day , samples were washed and permeabilized as described above . To label all bacteria ( intracellular and extracellular ) , samples were treated with rabbit anti - Listeria monocytogenes , Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit , mouse anti - CD147 and Alexa Fluor 350 - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibodies ( Tween - 20 present ) . Samples were mounted onto glass microscope slides using the Prolong Diamond antifade mounting medium ( without DAPI ) . When imaging samples , intracellular bacteria possessed signal solely from the Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies whereas extracellular bacteria were indicated by signal from both the Alexa Fluor 594 - the Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies . 6 . 5 . 12 . Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri intercellular spreading assays CD147 was knocked - down in HeLa cells ( in 24 well plates ) using siRNA . 96 hours post incubation with CD147 ( or non - targeting [ control ] ) siRNA duplexes , cells were infected with wild - type L . monocytogenes or S . flexneri . L . monocytogenes infections were rinsed 5X after 2 hours using pre - warmed PBS [ - / - ] and then 1 mL of pre - warmed DMEM containing 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 μg / mL ) was added to each infected well to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . Culture plates infected with S . flexneri infections were washed after 1 hour as describe above . After 8 hours of infection , cells were fixed and permeabilized using warm ( 37ºC ) 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % triton X - 100 ( as described above ) . Bacteria were detected with rabbit anti - Listeria monocytogenes or 216 rabbit anti - Shigella flexneri antisera followed by secondary antibody labelling with Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies . Infection foci ( imaged at 400x magnification ) and spreading area determination was performed as described by Talman and co - workers 539 . To determine the number of infected host cells per infection focus , host cells infected with bacteria were enumerated ( infection of a host cell was scored visually by the microscopist ) . This was accomplished by using a combination of 1 ) examining bacterially - derived actin - rich structures ( actin clouds , comet / rocket tails and membrane protrusions ) generated by the bacteria within the host cells and 2 ) general visual detection of the host cell as well as bacteria using nuclear staining ( DAPI ) . A host cell was scored as infected by the microscopist if at least one actin cloud , comet / rocket tail or membrane protrusion was evident within the cytoplasm of the host cell or if a bacterially - generated membrane protrusion clearly extended laterally from the edge of the host cell . 6 . 5 . 13 . Microscopy Images were acquired using a Leica DMI4000B ( Leica Microsystems ) inverted fluorescent microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . All devices were controlled by MetaMorph Imaging System software ( Universal Imaging ) . Images acquired were evaluated and processed using Metamorph Imaging System software or ImageJ . 6 . 5 . 14 . Listeria monocytogenes Comet / Rocket Tail and Membrane Protrusion Analysis L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tail lengths were measured manually using the line tool in the ImageJ software . Measurement were taken from cells infected for 8 hours . Any comet / rocket tails which were not visually in focus within 5 z slices ( height of 0 . 8  m ) were excluded from measurements as were those where a clear beginning ( bacterium - tail interface ) and end could not be ascertained . Membrane protrusions lengths were measured as described by the above criteria . Additionally , only membrane protrusions that extended outwards from the edges of the host cell ( in the x - y plane ) were included in measurements and not those which protruded upwards ( in the z plane ) and were not at the edges of the cell . To determine the distortedness of comet / rocket tails and membrane protrusions we calculated the tortuosity index of the structures which is defined as the ratio 217 of the actual tail / membrane protrusion length to the shortest distance between the bacterium - tail interface and the end of the tail / membrane protrusion 673 . 6 . 5 . 15 . Western blot quantification Protein quantification was performed using the gels tool in ImageJ . For each independent blot , all analyzed lanes were first adjusted for loading by normalizing the loading control signal against one of the control lanes . Following this , CD147 signal in all lanes was normalized against one of the control lanes . To obtain the adjusted and relative CD147 protein levels of each lane , the relative CD147 signal of each lane was divided by the relative loading control of that same lane . 6 . 5 . 16 . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed ( unblinded ) using GraphPad Prism version 6 . 01 . All results involving immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting were obtained from experiments performed at least 3 times ( n = 3 ) unless otherwise stated . Measurements were normalized to controls where indicated . All images shown are representative of experiments performed . 218 6 . 6 . Figures 219 220 Figure 6 . 1 .

Shown in box 1 , bacteria ( white open arrow ) initially contacting the host plasma membrane show CD147 staining as bright clustering at the bacterial pole in contact with the cell surface ( green arrows ) and CypA at the opposite pole where the actin comet / rocket tail originates ( red arrow ) . As the bacteria begin to protrude from the cell surface ( box 2 ) recruitment continues with CD147 at the membrane - facing and CypA at the cytoplasmic - facing pole of the bacteria . CypA is enriched throughout the actin tail that eventually pushes the bacteria past the host cell edge ; CD147 remains solely at the membrane surrounding the protrusion ( box 3 ) . CypA and CD147 appear to occupy similar regions specifically at zones where the membrane is in close proximity to the comet / rocket tail - bacteria interface ( box 3 , arrowhead ) . As membrane protrusions begin to extend further , CypA localization remains within the actin - rich core while CD147 continues to be recruited around the entirety of the protrusion membrane . This localization continues until the point where the membrane protrusion extends far from the cell body ( boxes 4 - 6 ) .

Typhimurium ) are highly infectious gastrointestinal human pathogens . These microbes inject bacterial - derived effector proteins directly into the host cell cytosol as part of their disease processes . A common host sub - cellular target of these pathogens is the actin cytoskeleton , which is commandeered by the bacteria and is used during their attachment onto ( EPEC ) or invasion into ( S . Typhimurium ) the host cells . We previously demonstrated that the host enzyme cyclophilin A ( CypA ) is recruited to the actin - rich regions of EPEC pedestals and S . Typhimurium membrane ruffles . To further expand the growing catalogue of host proteins usurped by actin - hijacking bacteria , we examined the host plasma membrane protein and cognate receptor of CypA , CD147 , during EPEC and S . Typhimurium infections . Here we show that CD147 is enriched at the basolateral regions of pedestals but , unlike CypA , it is absent from their actin - rich core . We show that CD147 recruitment to these areas requires EPEC pedestal formation and not solely bacteria - host cell contact . Additionally , we demonstrate that the depletion of CD147 by siRNA does not alter the formation of pedestals . Finally , we show that CD147 is also a component of actin - rich membrane ruffles generated during S . Typhimurium invasion of host cells . Collectively , our findings establish CD147 as another host component present at dynamic actin - rich structures formed during bacterial infections . 7 . 2 . Introduction The host actin cytoskeleton is a key target of many enteric bacterial pathogens 520 , 535 , 537 , 599 , 673 , 741 . Several medically relevant actin - hijacking microbes include members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S . Typhimurium ) . These pathogens commandeer the host Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization machinery during critical steps of their infectious processes such as during their entry into as well as for their movement atop host cells 109 , 597 , 610 , 742 . In order to exploit intracellular host proteins , the microbes utilize a multi - subunit proteinaceous needle - like apparatus ( commonly referred to as the type three secretion system [ T3SS ] ) to deliver specialized effector proteins directly into the host cytoplasm 727 . These injected effectors hijack a multitude of cellular 243 processes and organelles within the host cell , ultimately leading to disease of the infected individual . EPEC is a non - invasive human intestinal pathogen and is a major cause of diarrheal disease worldwide 743 . During these infections , these bacteria cause the loss ( effacement ) of microvilli in the localized area where the bacteria attach to the host enterocytes 744 . EPEC use over 20 different multifunctional effector proteins to target an array of host cell components 745 . One of these effectors is the translocated intimin receptor ( Tir ) , which embeds itself within the host plasma membrane once delivered through the T3SS 593 . Mechanistically , the extracellular domain of Tir binds to the EPEC surface protein intimin , which anchors the bacteria to the host cell surface 593 . The cytoplasmic domains of Tir then trigger the recruitment of the host actin polymerization machinery . This occurs through an assortment of phosphorylation events on Tir , the most prominent being at Y474 by host tyrosine kinases that elicit the recruitment of Nck which in turn recruits N - WASp and the Arp2 / 3 complex within the host cells , beneath the regions of EPEC attachment 108 – 110 , 598 . The activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex generates an extensive branched meshwork of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) that distends the plasma membrane , raising the bacteria off the natural surface of the host cell resulting in actin - rich protrusions ( commonly referred to as pedestals ) . Other crucial host cell actin - associated proteins at pedestals include the Arp2 / 3 activating protein cortactin , as well as the F - actin stabilizing proteins SM22 , calponin 1 and calponin 2 536 , 600 , 601 . Recent evidence also points towards a role for the formin family actin nucleator protein , mDia , as a potential generator of actin filament seeds for the Arp2 / 3 complex during pedestal biogenesis 602 . Pedestal biogenesis is further complicated by the crucial yet non - canonical role of clathrin endocytic machinery proteins such as dynamin 2 , CD2AP , epsin 1 , Eps15 and Hsc70 at the structures 338 , 568 , 603 , 746 , 747 . Once generated , EPEC pedestals become motile and permit the bacteria to “surf” atop the infected cells and spread onto neighboring ones 596 , 597 . In contrast to EPEC , S . Typhimurium uses effectors injected through one of its T3SSs to actively invade host cells . These disease - causing proteins usurp the host actin polymerization machinery by : 1 ) directly influencing F - actin organization ( SipA ) or 2 ) activating host cell signaling pathways which govern Arp2 / 3 - based actin polymerization ( SopB , SopE , and SopE2 ) 609 , 610 , 614 , 724 , 725 . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex at sites of bacteria - host contact results in the formation of large actin - rich dynamic ruffles of the plasma membrane that capture nearby S . Typhimurium bacteria to enable their entry into 244 the cell 726 . While actin constitutes a major cytoskeletal component of pedestals and membrane ruffles , this cytoskeletal element does not work alone as an assortment of publications have demonstrated that other host cytoskeletal systems such as the spectrin cytoskeleton as well as intermediate filament proteins are hijacked during both pedestal generation and bacterial invasion 537 , 748 , 749 . We have previously demonstrated that the eukaryotic enzyme / chaperone , cyclophilin A ( CypA ) , is hijacked by EPEC and S . Typhimurium at pedestals and membrane ruffles respectively 646 , 750 . CypA localizes specifically within the actin - rich regions of these structures . CypA commonly interacts with its cognate receptor CD147 301 , which is also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer ( EMMPRIN ) and basigin 751 , 752 . This plasma membrane glycoprotein is crucial for several cellular processes that involve the actin cytoskeleton 317 – 320 , 733 . CD147 promotes the proper formation and functioning of focal adhesions as well as lamellipodia in cultured cancer cells and regulates actin - rich invadopodia 317 , 319 , 320 , 733 . CD147 also functions extracellularly , where it mediates leukocyte migration ( chemotaxis ) via its interaction with extracellularly derived CypA 301 . Here we examine the distribution and role of CD147 during in vitro EPEC and S . Typhimurium infections . Because paired host receptor - ligand systems are present at an assortment of bacterially - induced actin - rich structures 249 , 753 , 754 , we tested the hypothesis that the cognate receptor of CypA , CD147 , would also be present at actin - rich structures generated by EPEC and S . Typhimurium . 7 . 3 . Results 7 . 3 . 1 . CD147 is Recruited to the Basolateral Surface of EPEC Pedestals but is Dispensable for their Formation When EPEC interact with their host cells they cause the distention of the host plasma membrane by recruiting copious actin filaments beneath the regions of bacterial attachment , leaving the microbes atop the cells on “pedestals” 594 . To investigate the potential involvement of CD147 at pedestals , we immunolocalized CD147 in HeLa cells infected with wild type EPEC ( strain E2348 / 69 ) . Immunostaining revealed an enrichment of CD147 ( compared to regions of the host cell without attached bacteria ) at sites of EPEC bacterial attachment ( Fig 7 . 1A ) . Upon closer examination , CD147 did not localize to the actin - rich cores of the pedestals but rather surrounded them in an irregular puncta - like 245 pattern ( Fig 7 . 1A , inset ) . To examine CD147 in more precise detail at pedestals we utilized a strain of EPEC ( JPN15 ) that generates larger and easily resolvable pedestals as it lacks the bundle - forming pili ( BFP ) genetic information in EPEC . Using this strain of EPEC we again saw that CD147 clearly localized at the periphery of the pedestals ( Fig 7 . 1A ) , extending along the lateral surfaces of the structures as well as the basal surface beneath the actin core forming a cup - like shape ( Fig 7 . 1B ) . Interestingly , we did not observe an enrichment of CD147 at the apical surface of pedestals ( Fig 7 . 1B ) . EPEC utilizes the T3SS effector Tir , in conjunction with the bacterial surface ligand intimin to firmly attach to the surface of host epithelial cells 593 . EPEC strains that do not express Tir , can attach to the surface of host cells and efface microvilli , but , do not generate pedestals and are associated with diminished infectivity of infected animals 593 , 755 . Because CD147 localizes around pedestals , we thought that CD147 recruitment at bacterial attachment sites might potentially represent an early signaling event that precedes the actin polymerization step of pedestal generation . However , we saw no evidence of CD147 enrichment at bacterial attachments sites when we infected HeLa cells with EPEC JPN15 Δ tir ( Fig 7 . 1A ) . Using an complemented EPEC JPN15 strain ( Δ tir + tir ) , CD147 localization was restored and surrounded pedestals in an indistinguishable manner as when we infected with the wild type EPEC JPN15 ( Fig 7 . 1A ) . Mechanistically , the Arp2 / 3 - mediated generation of pedestals primarily hinges on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 474 of Tir by host tyrosine kinases 108 – 110 , 598 . To test if the phosphorylation of this residue was essential for CD147 recruitment to pedestals , we infected HeLa cells with an EPEC JPN15 Δ tir mutant complemented with a variant of Tir that is non - phosphorylatable at residue 474 ( Δ tir + tir Y474F ) . We saw that CD147 was absent at those bacterial attachment sites ( Fig 7 . 1A ) . Despite CD147 localization to the perimeter of pedestals , our findings suggest that its recruitment to these regions is still dependent upon actin polymerization beneath the bacteria and not their firm attachment to the host cell surface . CD147 is a well - known asparagine - linked glycosylated protein 756 . Gao and colleagues recently found that the EPEC effector NleB functions as a glycosyltransferase 757 . This prompted us to examine whether EPEC infection of HeLa cells would alter the levels of any of the various glycosylated forms of CD147 found in those cells . When compared to uninfected samples , we observed no obvious alteration to the protein levels of any of the various glycosylated forms of CD147 during the wild type EPEC JPN15 infections ( Fig 7 . 1C ) . 246 To examine the functional role of CD147 at EPEC pedestals we depleted CD147 in HeLa cells using short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) ( Fig 7 . 1D ) and utilized immunofluorescence microscopy counts to quantify the pedestal formation efficiency ( percentage of surface - associated bacteria with pedestals ) of JPN15 infected HeLa cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] or CD147 - targeting siRNA sequences . We found that EPEC pedestal formation was unperturbed in cells with depleted of CD147 when compared to control cells treated with non - targeting [ control ] siRNA ( Fig 7 . 1E , F ) . 7 . 3 . 2 . CD147 is Recruited to S . Typhimurium Membrane Ruffles S . Typhimurium , like EPEC , co - opt the host actin cytoskeleton as a crucial stage of their infectious process . While EPEC generally remains extracellular atop actin - rich pedestals , S . Typhimurium utilize T3SS effectors to rapidly enter the host epithelia . Effectors delivered through this T3SS cause membrane ruffling of the host cell surface . As these membrane ruffles are also actin - rich membrane associated structures , we hypothesized that they may also be enriched with CD147 . When we examined HeLa cells infected with wild type S . Typhimurium ( strain SL1344 ) , endogenous CD147 was visibly enriched at the ruffles when compared to its normal cellular distribution ( Fig 7 . 2A ) . Primary antibody controls lacked any specific localization to the structures ( Fig 7 . 2B ) . When we examined the co - distribution of CD147 and F - actin at the structures , we noticed intense puncta of CD147 at the F - actin rich regions of the ruffles ; despite this , the two proteins did not colocalize completely . A number of injected T3SS effectors , that include SipA , SopB , SopE and SopE2 , control the host cytoskeletal remodeling that is required for S . Typhimurium epithelial invasion 609 , 610 , 614 , 724 , 725 . Because these effectors directly regulate host cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes such as actin , Cdc42 , Rac1 , MYO6 , and T - plastin 615 , 758 , 759 , we examined whether CD147 localization was also under a similar mode of control . To do this , we infected cultured cells with various S . Typhimurium effector mutants (  sipA and  sopB / E / E2 ) and assessed endogenous CD147 at the bacterial attachment sites or membrane ruffles . S . Typhimurium SipA augments bacterial invasion efficiency through its ability to enhance F - actin bundling in one of two ways : 1 ) by directly binding actin or 2 ) by modulating the activity of host F - actin bundling proteins such as T - plastin 614 – 616 . Despite this , SipA 247 expression is dispensable for membrane ruffle formation and bacterial invasion 614 . Immunostaining of HeLa cells infected with the S . Typhimurium  sipA mutant revealed there was no obvious alteration in the localization of CD147 at membrane ruffles as compared to the wild type infections ( Fig 7 . 2A ) . The S . Typhimurium effectors SopB , SopE and SopE2 usurp host Rho GTPases in order to activate the Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization machinery needed for membrane ruffle generation 609 , 610 , 724 , 725 . S . Typhimurium mutants that are deficient in all three effectors fail to generate membrane ruffles and thus do not invade the host epithelia 760 . To assess whether CD147 recruitment was dependent on membrane ruffle formation , we infected cultured HeLa cells with the S . Typhimurium  sopB / E / E2 mutant . We found no obvious CD147 enrichment at sites where the bacteria had maintained their adherence to the host cell surface , suggesting that membrane ruffle generation is a key signal for the recruitment of host CD147 to the structures ( Fig 7 . 2A ) . 7 . 4 . Discussion The current repertoire of host proteins that are recruited to EPEC pedestals exceeds 50 and is continually growing 761 . These proteins and their localizations are generally described as occupying one of 4 major regions of the pedestal : 1 ) the apical region directly beneath the structures ( clathrin 338 ; N - WASP 109 ; Hsc70 568 ) , 2 ) the stalk - like actin - rich region ( transgelin 536 ) , 3 ) the basal region which extends beyond the actin - rich parts of the stalk ( spectrin 537 , 749 ) and 4 ) the edges of the pedestal that surround the actin core ( adducin and protein 4 . 1 537 , 749 ) . In this manuscript our most significant finding was our identification of CD147 at the basolateral edges of pedestals . Although we showed that CD147 expression is unchanged during the infections and that CD147 is not required for pedestal formation , its localization at the periphery of the structures might lead to clues to its associations with other proteins within the structures . The cup - like localization pattern of CD147 at pedestals resembles very closely that of the spectrin - associated protein adducin 537 , 749 . Thus , could CD147 and the spectrin cytoskeleton represent a new functional system at pedestals ? Despite limited literature on the subject , there is evidence that CD147 could in fact control spectrin cytoskeletal organization as Besse and colleagues reveal a role for Drosophila melanogaster CD147 in organizing spectrin and actin at neuromuscular junctions 762 . 248 Our RNAi studies demonstrate that CD147 is not required for pedestal generation and suggest that an unknown functional redundancy may be at play during these infections . If CD147 is not crucial for the formation of pedestals , what else could it be doing at these structures ? Hints to its role at pedestals may lie in its normal cellular role during signaling events . CD147 can interact with CD147 molecules expressed on neighboring cells ( trans interactions ) as well as those on the same cell surface ( cis interactions ) 734 . One potential explanation for CD147 clustering at the edges and base of pedestals may be to “communicate” or signal to nearby bacteria at their CD147 - rich pedestal edges . As multiple EPEC bacteria generally collect into clusters ( microcolonies ) on the surface of the host cell , the lateral edges of pedestals could represent an easily accessible region for neighboring bacteria to signal to one another . Recent findings by Velle and Campellone ( 2017 ) revealed the presence of EPEC “macrocolonies” or large foci of bacteria which span several host epithelial cells 597 . Could CD147 signaling promote this expansion of EPEC bacteria across multiple host cells ? One potential mechanism , with its roots derived from the normal cellular role of CD147 in promoting the proper formation and activity of actin - rich lamellipodia , focal adhesion and invadopodia , is that CD147 signaling promotes the actin - based motility / formation of EPEC macrocolonies . Whether CD147 does in fact possess functional activity at pedestals will require further investigation . We were unable to functionally assess the role of CD147 during S . Typhimurium infections as a CD147 null cell line was not available . Consequently , further studies into whether CD147 influences bacterial infection dynamics and the organization of actin or spectrin - based components such as adducin requires further scrutiny . In conclusion we have shown that CD147 is a new component of the actin - rich structures generated by EPEC and S . Typhimurium during their infectious processes . Although not essential for EPEC pedestal formation , our morphological findings present the possibility of CD147 interacting with spectrin - associated components . The investigation into the role of CD147 at these structures and those generated by other actin - hijacking microbes 315 , 740 is ongoing as clues to its precise function at these sites may reveal themselves through comparative work . 249 7 . 5 .

General Discussion The commonly used model of the intracellular lifecycle of L . monocytogenes was first described 30 years ago by Tilney and Portnoy 493 . For the next ~ 20 years , many groups set their sights on uncovering the precise molecular mechanisms governing the initial invasion of the bacteria into host cells and actin comet / rocket tail formation 67 , 107 , 338 , 347 , 474 , 478 , 479 , 493 , 497 , 509 , 542 , 543 , 576 , 763 , 764 . Along the way , and through using the L . monocytogenes actin - generated structures as research tools , several fundamental discoveries to general eukaryotic cell biology were also realized , such as the functional characterization of the Arp2 / 3 complex 52 , 105 , 107 , 494 , profilin 107 , 765 , 766 and VASP 219 , 220 , 576 , as well as the identification of non - canonical functions for the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery 347 , 348 . It wasn’t until Pust and colleagues ( 2005 ) pivotal investigation of ezrin during L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation and cell - to - cell spreading , that researchers began to seriously examine the host and bacterial factors involved during the bacterial dissemination process 249 . To date , only a handful of factors have been identified at the bacterial membrane protrusions 249 , 534 , 539 . Moreoever , prior to the work presented in this thesis , no host or bacterial components had been characterized at the invaginations generated in host cells that receive the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions . Taken together , despite the several decades’ worth of research into L . monocytogenes infections , the mechanistic model of L . monocytogenes dissemination remains incomplete . To spread in tissues , L . monocytogenes bacteria must first become motile within the host intracellular environment . The minimal host constituents required to induce L . monocytogenes actin - based motility via comet / rocket tails have been known for many years 107 . However , like many of the actin - rich structures generated normally in eukaryotic cells , factors that are involved during L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tail formation continue to be discovered . This is clearly evident from the recent discoveries of stathmin , tubulin , transgelin , crmp1 , and lamellipodin at these structures over the past 5 years 195 , 217 – 219 . Research continues as these host proteins are essential for disease progression through their ability to avoid autophagy and induce membrane protrusion formation 249 , 534 , 539 , 583 , 584 . Conversely , the comet / rocket tails themselves have proved to be useful tools to help uncover new functions of previously known proteins . An example of this is the actin - associated protein , palladin , which was initially revealed to be present at actin - rich bacterial structures through a mass spectrometry screen of isolated EPEC pedestals 258 performed by our laboratory 646 . In the eukaryotic cell , palladin is a crucial component of several actin - rich structures such as lamellipodia , stress fibers , dorsal ruffles , podosomes and neural growth cones 201 , 204 , 205 , 209 , 661 , 769 . In addition to this , palladin directly interacts with actin filaments 186 , 187 , 206 . Given this , as well as the fact that the role of palladin during bacterial infections was unknown , it was an appropriate candidate to investigate during L . monocytogenes infections , and in particular , at comet / rocket tails . My research identified palladin at the actin - rich L . monocytogenes invasion sites , “clouds” surrounding immotile bacteria and comet / rocket tails . Shortly after this , our collaborator Moriah Beck demonstrated that palladin could form branched actin filament arrays when purified palladin and G - actin were co - incubated in vitro 206 . Interestingly , several studies also highlighted the ability of eukaryotic cells to undergo cellular motility even in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex 93 , 142 , 770 . With this in mind , we asked the question , could palladin generate branched actin filaments around L . monocytogenes and ultimately form into a comet / rocket tail in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex ? This is a crucial question in cell biology , since the Arp2 / 3 complex has long been considered as the driving force behind branched F - actin - mediated motility . To test this , we depleted cells of the Arp2 / 3 complex using the inhibitor CK - 666 . In cells inhibited for the Arp2 / 3 complex , comet / rocket tails disassembled . Amazingly , in Arp2 / 3 knockout cells which we overexpressed palladin , comet / rocket tails maintained their motility . In my continued examination of palladin , I found that it was absent from the actin - rich L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions which are used to propel the bacteria into neighbouring host cells . The phenomenon of protein exclusion at membrane protrusions also holds true for other actin crosslinkers , such as  - actinin 1 and nexilin 535 , 578 . Conversely , during my examination of CypA and CD147 , I discovered that these host proteins were present exclusively at L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions , but not actin clouds or comet / rocket tails . Consequently , an important question emerged from this ; why might the protein constituents of comet / rocket tails differ from those found at membrane protrusions and what is the functional consequence of this switch in protein components ? The L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tail consists of a dense dendritic - like network of F - actin within the structures 106 , 113 , 479 , 493 . However , comet / rocket tails are not exclusively formed from branched actin ; Jasnin and colleagues ( 2013 ) performed a cryo - electron microscopic examination of L . monocytogenes comet / rocket tails and found stiff 259 crosslinked bundles of actin filaments within the structures 113 . Brieher and colleagues ( 2004 ) also demonstrated long fascin - bundled F - actin , resembling a hollow cylinder , at the edges of the comet / rocket tail 114 . In fact , these long F - actin bundles were sufficient to propel the bacteria even when the dendritic - like F - actin core normally present within the structures was removed using reconstitution assays 114 . Thus , could L . monocytogenes selectively hijack actin crosslinkers , such as palladin , transgelin , nexilin and  - actinin 1 , to stiffen the comet / rocket tail ? Others have proposed that comet / rocket tail stiffness enables the bacteria to traverse the crowded intracellular environment , thus influencing their movement , and in turn , their cell - to - cell spreading 113 , 771 . In fact , when McGrath and colleagues ( 2003 ) increased the viscosity and thus drag load of actin - rich cytoplasmic extracts using methylcellulose , the comet / rocket tails compensated by nearly doubling in F - actin density 771 . I postulate that in the absence of this stiffness , the comet / rocket tails would become distorted , move at slower rates , and reach the cell surface at a lower frequency . Evidence for this comes from several studies that examined host cells depleted of comet / rocket tail F - actin crosslinking agents such as nexilin and transgelin 187 , 195 . In those studies , comet / rocket tails became shorter and bent in the absence of nexilin or transgelin 187 , 195 . I show similar findings in cells depleted of palladin . Dold and colleagues ( 1994 ) inhibition  - actinin 1 resulted in immobile L . monocytogenes bacteria 577 . I transfected host cells with the actin - binding and crosslinking deficient mutant variant of palladin . In those cells , I observed a ~ 2 . 4 fold decrease in bacterial motility rates . Although I did not examine the effect of decreased motility on the formation of membrane protrusions , others have . Sidhu and colleagues treatment of cells with the PI - 3 kinase inhibitor , LY294002 , slowed motile L . monocytogenes bacteria 772 . Importantly , they also observed a ~ 4 - fold reduction in number of membrane protrusions . This reduction in number of membrane protrusions was also observed by Dold and co - workers in their study inhibiting  - actinin 1 577 . Taken together , these observations highlight the comet / rocket tail as a robust actin - rich platform comprised of many F - actin stiffening agents ( such as palladin , nexilin and transgelin ) , which effectively transmits the bacteria to the host cell surface . Does this internal actin architecture of the comet / rocket tail also hold true at the membrane protrusion ? Interestingly , electron microscopic examination of the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion reveals a drastic alteration in the F - actin network within the structures in comparison to the cytosolic comet / rocket tail 106 , 115 , 493 , 539 . Like the comet / rocket tail , a 260 branched Arp2 / 3 - based F - actin meshwork is observed proximal to the bacterial surface within the membrane protrusion 106 , 113 , 115 , 539 . However , the distal regions of the protrusions are comprised of long unbranched actin filament bundles 106 , 113 , 115 , 539 . This is accomplished by L . monocytogenes bacteria commandeering the formin class of actin nucleators when the membrane protrusion is initiated 534 . In infected host cells depleted of formin proteins , membrane protrusions are significantly shorter while comet / rocket tails remain unaltered 534 . Thus , actin assembly by these formins could help to explain the appearance of long unbranched filaments within the membrane protrusions . Cryo - electron microscopic examination of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions by Jasnin and colleagues ( 2013 ) revealed that many of these long actin filaments are closely associated with the plasma membrane , while the core of the structures remains almost hollow 113 . This unusual hollowing of the membrane protrusion could be the result of the loss of actin crosslinkers , such as palladin , nexilin and  - actinin 1 , within the comet / rocket tail as it reaches the host cell surface 535 , 578 . In place of these actin crosslinkers , the bacteria seemingly rely on another set of host factors , such as the actin - binding proteins ezrin and  - actinin 4 , the membrane receptors CD44 and CD147 , as well as the protein folding enzyme CypA 249 . Collectively , this begs the question , why does L . monocytogenes need to induce a dramatic change in the F - actin network and the type of host factors found within membrane protrusions compared to comet / rocket tails ? To answer this , one must consider that unlike the comet / rocket tail , which simply propels L . monocytogenes bacteria within the host cytoplasm , the process of spreading between host cells requires that motile bacteria push against the host plasma membrane . The lipid bilayer , by its very nature , possesses various elastic characteristics , such as surface tension and resistance to deformation , which are often at play during normal cellular processes 773 – 781 . Thus , it may seem counterintuitive that the bacteria switch from a dense ( and stiff ) meshwork enriched with crosslinkers , such as palladin , nexilin and  - actinin 1 , to an F - actin network that also forms a hollow - like tube of long unbranched filaments within certain segments of the structures to deform the lipid bilayer during bacterial membrane protrusion formation . However , a growing body of evidence suggests that active actin - based propulsion , such that occurs during bacterial cytosolic motility , may not be the sole ( or major ) factor that drives cell - to - cell spreading ( see below ) . This is not to say the actin - based motility of the bacteria is unimportant ; rather , the main function of comet / rocket - based motility may in fact be to simply move the bacteria towards the host cell surface so 261 they can then initiate the protrusion forming mechanism . This could explain previous observations of fewer membrane protrusions when bacterial motility rates were slowed 577 , 772 . My findings and those of others hints that other , non - motility based mechanisms are at play during membrane protrusion formation and their eventual engulfment by the host cell . Possible mechanism are described below . Transitions from branched to parallel actin - based structures occur normally in cells . The lamellipodium at the leading edge of motile cells , like the comet / rocket tail , is rich in branched actin filaments whereas filopodial protrusions , which can emanate from the leading edge , are characterized by actin filament bundles that use parallel actin that is bundled along their length 23 – 25 , 83 , 113 , 147 , 782 – 785 . A model proposed by Hoffmann and Schafer also depicts fascin exchanging for palladin as filopodial F - actin bundles enter the branched actin - containing lamellipodium 786 . Despite a lack of evidence , I speculate that a similar transition is occurring within L . monocytogenes protrusions . With that said , the exact mechanism behind filopodium generation is currently debated and thus I can only speculate as to why L . monocytogenes might also hijack bundled actin 25 , 83 , 151 , 787 – 789 . Indeed , some of the first terminology used to describe L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions were “filopod” and “pseudopod” 115 , 521 , 732 , 772 , 790 , 791 . Like filopodia , the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion extends outwards as a narrow projection from the cell surface and both structures are motile 142 , 539 . The presence of formin proteins ( and bundled F - actin ) is of course puzzling , but one possibility is they may serve to lengthen and stabilize the relatively thin membranous protrusive structures more efficiently than branched actin . Whether or not L . monocytogenes also sense and signal within their microenvironment remains an important question to be answered . Importantly , both filopodia and L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions rely on many of the same proteins for their proper formation . Ezrin , CD44 , formins , CD147 ,  - actinin 4 and cyclophilins are all crucial for the proper formation of filopodial structures and L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions 249 , 534 . Indeed , the appearance of collapsed and shorter membrane protrusions is also phenocopied in ezrin depleted cells at their filopodia ( and also microvilli ) 792 – 794 . Conversely , the absence of these membrane protrusion specific factors ( ezrin , CD44 , formins , CD147 ,  - actinin 4 and CypA ) at cytosolic comet / rocket tails , and the fact that comet / rocket tails maintain their normal morphology / function in cells inhibited of these proteins hints towards their selective role during membrane protrusion formation 249 , 534 . Whether or not other comet / rocket tail actin crosslinkers are also absent at the membrane 262 protrusions remains to be seen . Ultimately , we are only in the early stages of unraveling the mechanisms behind L . monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation and although my findings highlight new host factors that are vital at the structures , they also bring to light many fundamental questions that need to be answered including : 1 ) how do the membrane receptors CD44 and CD147 become clustered around membrane protrusions , 2 ) how are formin proteins and CypA selectively recruited within the membrane protrusion core , 3 ) what is the exact function of CypA within the protrusion core and 4 ) can L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions actively degrade interstitial matrix ? Historically it has long been thought that motile L . monocytogenes bacteria “push” into neighbouring cells using the L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions and that this governs their internalization and spreading from one cell to another . Upon closer examination of L . monocytogenes spreading events , a cup - like invagination is generated at the surface of the membrane protrusion - receiving cell . My finding of CD147 at the invagination membrane suggests that these structures might be endocytic given their overall morphology as well as the fact that CD147 can trigger endocytosis 335 , 346 , 795 – 800 . However , compared to conventional endocytic pits , the L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations are many fold larger than regular endosomes ( μm vs . nm ) . Yet there is evidence of the host endocytic machinery at micron - scaled structures : EPEC and S . flexneri commandeer clathrin and its associated proteins during actin pedestal formation and cell - to - cell spreading respectively 338 , 349 . Surprisingly , I found the caveolin endocytic machinery , as well as the clathrin interacting protein epsin - 1 , localized to the membrane invaginations induced as the protrusions projected into neighboring host cells . Depletion of caveolin - 1 or epsin - 1 perturbed bacterial cell - to - cell spreading suggesting these invaginations are actively internalizing the invading protrusion . I also reveal that isolated non - motile membrane protrusions which are in contact with the host cell surface induce the recruitment of caveolar endocytic components around the structures . Despite the recruitment of those proteins , those isolated protrusions did not enter the host cells . Consequently , an interplay between the endocytic and actin propulsive events are likely required for these large structures to enter neighbouring cells . Aside from the direct significance of caveolin for L . monocytogenes dissemination , the membrane invaginations now present an exciting model for researchers to study large scale endocytic events . A considerable amount of controversy exists in the field of caveolin endocytosis , mainly regarding the exact role of caveolae within cells . While caveolae can internalize 263 extracellular cargo normally in cell , I show here that caveolae indirectly permit the entry of large particles through their ability to collapse into the plasma membrane . Whether or not other bacterial pathogens usurp non - canonical functions of the caveolin endocytic machinery for their invasion or dissemination will be great interest for future investigations . 264 Chapter 9 . Future Directions Palladin In chapter 2 , I demonstrated that palladin can functionally compensate for the loss of the Arp2 / 3 complex during L . monocytogenes actin - based motility . This work follows up on the in vitro discovery of branched actin filaments when purified palladin and actin were co - incubated 206 . Taken together , one crucial question comes to mind , can palladin nucleate branched F - actin arrays normally in cells ? Furthermore , could these palladin - mediated F - actin arrays drive cellular motility ? A discovery such as this could significantly alter the current landscape in how cell biologists currently view actin - based motility given that the Arp2 / 3 complex , followed closely by the formin family of proteins , are considered the major engines driving cell migration both in vitro and in vivo . One way to examine this would be to utilize a highly motile immortalized cell line depleted of the Arp2 / 3 complex . A simple way to deplete the Arp2 / 3 complex would be to inhibit it using the potent inhibitor CK - 666 , as described in chapter 2 494 . Another potentially effective , but laborious approach , would be to ablate genomic sequences encoding the major Arp2 / 3 subunits ( Arp2 and Arp3 ) using CRISPR / Cas9 . Following this , one could examine cell motility rates of individual cells or groups of cells ( via a scratch assay ) , two - dimensionally ( i . e . on a glass coverslip ) , using real - time phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy . Importantly , these motility rates could then be compared to Arp2 / 3 depleted cells also overexpressing wild - type palladin . To examine the actin cytoskeleton within Arp2 / 3 depleted cells versus depleted cells overexpressing palladin , metal replica electron microscopy could be utilized as this method provides a high resolution and three - dimensional depiction of actin arrays versus convention transmission electron microscopy techniques 23 , 24 . Because cells generally do not migrate two - dimensionally in the body , it will also be crucial to examine the role of palladin during cellular migration in three - dimensional cell culture as this method better represents the microenvironment of living tissue . Interestingly , the literature describes several cancers in which palladin is highly upregulated 664 – 667 . Because these tumor cells are extremely motile , could palladin therefore be co - opted to produce additional F - actin branches to help drive cell migration ? Thus , I envision the use of confocal microscopy imaging of these three dimensionally cultured tumor cells , in 265 conjunction with perfusion of the 3D matrix itself with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor , CK - 666 . If palladin does in fact promote cell migration via its actin nucleating activity , I postulate that these tumor cells would display high levels of motility even in the absence of functional Arp2 / 3 . Several other bacterial ( and viral ) pathogens , such as S . flexneri and Rickettsia rickettsii ( R . rickettsia ) generate actin comet / rocket tails for their intracellular motility 106 , 738 , 801 , 802 . Thus , it will also be important to find out whether or not these pathogens also hijack palladin during their actin - based motility . Importantly , the actin comet / rocket tails generated by R . rickettsia bacteria are well - known for containing abundant parallel F - actin arrays 106 , 801 . Thus , R . rickettsia comet / rocket tails could be utilized as a cell biological tool to understand the role of palladin at parallel F - actin - containing structures in the cell . Cyclophilin A and CD147 CypA and CD147 expression are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions ; however , the precise mechanism behind CypA - and CD147 - mediated protrusion stabilization remains unclear . Given that both proteins do not possess any known actin - binding domains or motifs , there most likely exists a missing host factor which links these proteins to the F - actin within the structures . A potential candidate to investigate at membrane protrusions is α - actinin 4 , as Maïssa and colleagues identified it as a new binding partner of CD147 during N . meningitidis infections 325 . Depletion of α - actinin 4 using siRNA will provide a quick and easy method to examine any morphological changes to membrane protrusions in the absence of α - actinin 4 . The formin family of proteins as well as the ERM protein , ezrin , are also crucial for membrane protrusion formation 249 . Therefore , it will be important to determine whether or not these proteins directly interact with CypA and / or CD147 . Because CypA is well known as a molecular chaperone , could CypA properly activate formins and / or ezrin at membrane protrusions ? CD147 induces the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , which degrade interstitial matrix 803 – 810 . Thus , it would be interesting to examine the presence of these MMPs at membrane protrusions during infection of host cells that are also adhered onto a matrix - like substrate given recent findings highlighting L . monocytogenes exit at the basal face of polarized epithelial cells 495 . 266 Caveolin - 1 My finding that caveolin - 1 , and caveolae as a whole , play a crucial role in the uptake of L . monocytogenes membrane protrusions adds further support for a non - canonical role of caveolin in large particle endocytosis 647 , 648 . While there exists some evidence in the field that caveolin could regulate phagocytosis ( the uptake of large particles such as dead / dying cell and pathogens ) , the precise function of caveolin during these processes remains unclear 647 , 648 . Importantly , whether or not other caveolar proteins are also involved in these large scale endocytic events remains unclear . Thus , L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations could represent a potential model to study caveolar components during large scale endocytosis . One of the major questions regarding the presence of caveolar proteins , as well as the clathrin - interacting protein epsin - 1 , at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations is in what order do these proteins arrive at the structures ? Of course , it will also be useful to examine the order by which these proteins are shed from the eventual double - membraned vacuoles once the invaginations have undergone scission . The sequence of endocytic protein arrival ( and shedding ) from clathrin coated pits / vesicles is well - studied ; however , the same cannot be said of caveolae 326 – 329 , 333 , 350 , 430 , 811 , 812 . One way to accomplish this would be to utilize confocal ( or super resolution ) microscopy to live image membrane invagination forming cells that express fluorescently - tagged versions of the various invagination proteins described in chapter 3 . Specifically , each protein should be tracked starting from the initial contact of the membrane protrusion with the receiving cell surface and all the way through to the eventual scission of the invagination into a double - membraned vacuole . Clathrin endocytosis utilizes over 30 proteins . Therefore , although my findings in chapter 3 show a clear absence of clathrin , and the major clathrin adaptor protein , AP2 , at L . monocytogenes membrane invaginations , a full analysis of the remaining clathrin endocytic proteins should be carried out . Furthermore , eukaryotic cells also utilize several clathrin - and caveolin - independent micropinocytic mechanisms , such as those controlled by Arf6 , endophillin , the flotillins , and GRAF1 330 , 335 , 398 , 813 – 819 , 820 ( p6 ) . These proteins should also be examined ( as described in chapter 3 ) at L . monocytogenes invaginations in order to understand the full extent of host endocytic mechanisms at play during bacterial cell - to - cell spreading events . The identification of any of these other endocytic proteins at the 267 structures could provide crucial insight into the potential for endocytic mechanism cross - talk , as these pathways are generally considered to function independently of one another normally during endocytosis . 268 Chapter 10 . Conclusion In conclusion , my findings expand the current repertoire of host factors that are exploited during infections by actin - hijacking pathogens . My investigation of palladin , cyclophilin A , and CD147 during L . monocytogenes , EPEC , S . Typhimurium and S . flexneri infections , highlights key roles for these proteins at several well - known stages of the bacteria infectious cycle . In parallel to this , I exploited the bacterial infections , and the actin - rich structures they generate , as a useful cell biological tool in order to uncover new cellular functions for these host proteins . Lastly , my discovery that L . monocytogenes exploits host caveolin for efficient cell - to - cell spreading , answers the longstanding question of how membrane protrusions are engulfed by cells . As the host actin cytoskeleton and endocytic machinery are common targets of many human pathogens , these findings provide a way to help unravel some of the mechanisms underlying common microbe - host interactions . Furthermore , this work also represents another perspective by which to rethink some of the literature on actin cytoskeletal dynamics as well as caveolin - mediated endocytosis and to address some of the controversies within these fields . 269 References 1 .
