They are intrigued by the exotic nature of indigenous people , issues and history . Often Aboriginal Studies is like looking into another reality and the desire to appropriate something “different” is strong . As well , students who understand some of the political issues come with convictions about Aboriginal people’s position in Canada . They often have simplistic understandings about very complex issues . Some students may want to “help” while others may want to “influence” . No matter what , in today’s Canada , chances are that all students in life and in careers will rub shoulders with Aboriginal people . With certainty , as Aboriginal people have influenced Canada in the past , they will continue to have an impact on all Canadians and students want and need to know about their Aboriginal neighbours . The first two lessons focus on helping students get a very broad understanding of how Aboriginal people are positioned in the Canadian matrix . The objective is to introduce students to a geographical and historical framework in which to position information that they will learn in subsequent lessons .
