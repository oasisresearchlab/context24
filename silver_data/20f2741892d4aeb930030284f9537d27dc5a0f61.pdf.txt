Here , we deliver purified recombinant Cas9 protein and guide RNA into cultured human cells including hard - to - transfect fibroblasts and plu - ripotent stem cells . RGEN ribonucleoproteins ( RNPs ) induce site - specific mutations at frequencies of up to 79 % , while reducing off - target mutations associated with plasmid transfection at off - target sites that differ by one or two nucleotides from on - target sites . RGEN RNPs cleave chromosomal DNA almost immediately after delivery and are degraded rapidly in cells , reducing off - target effects . Furthermore , RNP delivery is less stressful to human embryonic stem cells , producing at least twofold more colonies than does plasmid transfection . [ Supplemental material is available for this article . ] The type II CRISPR ( clustered , regularly interspaced , short palin - dromic repeat ) / Cas ( CRISPR - associated ) system is an adaptive im - mune response in bacteria and archaea , which functions by rec - ognizing and cleaving foreign DNA from phages and plasmids via Cas9proteinandguideRNAs , whosesequencesarepartiallyderived from the invaders ( Horvath and Barrangou 2010 ; Wiedenheft et al . 2012 ) . Recently , we and others exploited this system to develop RNA - guided endonucleases or engineered nucleases ( RGENs ) that enable targeted genome editing in cultured human cells ( Cho et al . 2013a ; Cong et al . 2013 ; Jinek et al . 2013 ; Mali et al . 2013b ) , zebrafish embryos ( Hwang et al . 2013 ) , and bacteria ( Jiang et al . 2013 ) . Since then , RGENs have been successfully used to modify genomes in various species including model organisms ( Cho et al . 2013b ; Dickinsonetal . 2013 ; Friedlandetal . 2013 ; Gratzetal . 2013 ; Li et al . 2013a , c ; Wang et al . 2013 ; Sung et al . 2014 ) and plants ( Li etal . 2013b ; Nekrasovetal . 2013 ; Shanetal . 2013 ) , rapidlycatching up with their precursors , namely , zinc finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) ( Bibikovaetal . 2003 ; PorteusandBaltimore2003 ) andtranscription activator - like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) ( Miller et al . 2011 ) . Thus , RGENs are now a new member in the growing family of engineered nucleases ( Kim and Kim 2014 ) . These enzymes cleave chromosomal DNA in cells , producing site - specific double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) , the repair of which via endogenous homologous recombination ( HR ) or nonhomologous end joining ( NHEJ ) gives rise to targeted mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements . We have developed and improved all of these types of pro - grammable nucleases over the last several years ( Kim et al . 2009 , 2010 , 2011 ; Cho et al . 2013a ; Kim et al . 2013a ; Sung et al . 2013 ) and reported that the specificity and activity of RGENs are at least on par with those of their precursors . Unlike ZFNs and TALENs , whose DNA - targeting specificities are altered by protein engi - neering , new RGENs with desired specificities can be prepared simply by replacing guide RNAs . Furthermore , use of in vitro transcribed guide RNAs rather than plasmids that encode them makes this system cloning - free ( Cho et al . 2013a ) . For efficient genome editing via RGENs , the successful delivery ofguideRNA andCas9 intocells isessential . Inanimal experiments , in vitro transcribed Cas9 - encoding mRNA or recombinant Cas9 protein can be directly injected into one - cell stage embryos using glass needles to obtain genome - edited animals . To express Cas9 and guide RNA in cultured cells in vitro , typically , plasmids that encode them are transfected via lipofection or electroporation . Unfortunately , use of plasmids is often limited by random in - tegration of all or part of the plasmid DNA into the host genome , a process known as stable transfection . Plasmid DNA can also be inserted at RGEN on - target and off - target sites ( Gabriel et al . 2011 ) . Indeed , we found that at least one out of three large insertions and six out of 26 ( 23 % ) small insertions at off - target sites , reported in two recent papers ( Cradick et al . 2013 ; Fu et al . 2013 ) , were derived from the Cas9 - or sgRNA - encoding plasmid ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . Unwanted insertions of plasmid DNA sequences at off - target sites are difficult to detect and , therefore , more problematic than those at on - target sites . These foreign sequences can cause host immune responses ( Hemmi et al . 2000 ; Wagner 2001 ) , hampering the use of gene - edited primary or stem cells in cell therapy . In addition , DNA transfection is often stressful to cells . For example , plasmid DNA introduced into cells triggers cyclic GMP - AMP synthase activation ( Sunetal . 2013 ) . Furthermore , prolongedexpressionofRGENsfrom plasmid DNA , which can persist in cells for several days post - transfection , can aggravate off - target effects ( Gaj et al . 2012 ) . In line with these concerns , cells transfected with plasmids for biomedical applications or animals and plants derived from DNA - transfected cells are regarded as genetically modified by regulatory authorities ( Podevin et al . 2013 ; Pauwels et al . 2014 ) , requiring a costly and lengthy regulation procedure for approval in most developed countries .

RGEN ribonucleoproteins ( RNPs ) induce small in - sertions and deletions ( indels ) at target sites almost immediately after delivery into cells and are degraded rapidly , reducing off - target effects . Results Targeted mutagenesis in human cells using RGEN RNPs Recombinant Cas9 protein was purified from Escherichia coli ( Supplemental Fig . 1 ) and complexed with in vitro transcribed single - chain guide RNA ( sgRNA ) composed of essential portions of target - specific CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) and target - independent trans - activating crRNA ( tracrRNA ) or dualRNA that consists of crRNA and tracrRNA . The resulting RNP complex was transfected into the human leukemia K562 cell line via electroporation . At 48 h post - transfection , RGEN - induced indel frequency was measured using T7 endonuclease I ( T7E1 ) , which cleaves heteroduplexes formed by the hybridization of mutant and wild - type sequences or two different mutant sequences . The RGEN RNP designed to target the CCR5 gene , which encodes a chemokine receptor that also acts as an HIV co - receptor , was highly active , inducing mutations at fre - quencies of up to 57 % in a dose - dependent manner , comparable to that obtained with plasmids ( Fig . 1A ; Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . Small deletions or insertions , signature of error - prone DSB repair via NHEJ , were observed at the target site ( Fig . 1B ) , reminiscent of those observed with ZFNs and TALENs ( Kim et al . 2013b ) . We found that up to sixfold molarexcess of sgRNA overCas9 protein is required to maximize mutation frequencies ( Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . To target several other loci in K562 , we prepared new RGENs by simply replacing sgRNA in the RNP complex . These RGENs de - livered as RNPs were highly active , inducing mutations at fre - quencies that ranged from 16 % to 72 % ( Fig . 1C ; Supplemental Fig . 3 ) . The average mutation frequency obtained with RGEN RNPs at eight different sites in K562 cells was 44 6 7 % under optimal conditions . Note that T7E1 cannot cleave homoduplexes formed by the hybridization of identical mutant sequences and , therefore , often provides an underestimate of indel frequencies , especially when nucleases are highly active , producing identical mutant se - quences ( Kim et al . 2014 ) . To rule out the possibility that RGEN RNPs cleave chromo - somal DNA after cell lysis and that indels are produced by endog - enous proteins associated with NHEJ in the cell lysate under cell - free conditions rather than intracellularly ( Budman and Chu 2005 ) , we transfected Cas9 protein complexed with dualRNA ( rather than sgRNA ) into K562 cells and isolated single cell - derived clones via limiting dilution . DualRNA was less potent than sgRNA . Mutant clones were obtained at frequencies of 12 % ( Supplemental Fig . 4 ) . Furthermore , no mutations were detected using the T7E1 assay when cells were incubated with RGEN RNPs without elec - troporation ( data not shown ) . These results show that RGEN RNPs entered cells and cleaved chromosomal DNA , triggering the for - mation of indels at target sites . Genome editing in human primary cells and embryonic stem cells We then investigated whether RGEN RNPs enable efficient ge - nome editing in hard - to - transfect human primary cells such as BJ fibroblasts and pluripotent stem cells such as H9 ES cells . In these cells that are refractory to DNA transfection , RNP delivery via electroporation was at least twofold more efficient than plasmid Figure 1 .

Genome Research 1013 www . genome . org RNA - guided genome editing via Cas9 RNP delivery transfection . Thus , the delivery of the CCR5 - specific RGEN RNP induced indels at frequencies of 19 % and 23 % in BJ fibroblasts and H9 ES cells , respectively , whereas plasmid transfection gave rise to indels at frequencies of 9 % and 10 % , respectively ( Fig . 2A ) . We also tested three other RGEN RNPs in H9 cells and found that the four RGENs induced indels at a frequency of 20 6 3 % on average ( Fig . 2B ) . Notably , RNP delivery wasless toxic to ES cells , producing at least twofold more colonies than did plasmid transfection ( Fig . 2C ) . No apparent changes in the morphology of ES cell colonies were observedafterRGENRNP transfection ( Fig . 2D ) . Furthermore , all of the colonies expressed alkaline phosphatase , a marker for pluripotency ( Fig . 2D ) . TheseresultssuggestthatuseofRGENRNPs rather than plasmids could facilitate isolation of genome - modified clones of ES cells or induced pluripotent stem cells . Oligonucleotide - directed genome editing via homology - directed repair Next , weinvestigatedwhetherRGENRNPscanbeco - transfectedwith homologous donor DNA to achieve genome editing via homology - directed repair . We used single - stranded oligodeoxynucleotides ( ssODNs ) ( Chen et al . 2011 ) rather than gene - targeting vectors or PCR amplicons as donor DNA to avoid the possibility that vector - or amplicon - derived double - strand DNA segments could be inserted randomly in the genome or specifically at RGEN on - or off - target sites . Co - delivery of the AAVS1 - specific RNP and an ssODN containing a diagnostic XbaI site gave rise to targeted ge - nome modification in K562 cells at a frequency of 15 % measured by XbaI digestion ( Fig . 3 ) . This method can be used to insert small DNA sequences such as loxP or those that encode affinity tags or antigens at pre - determined genomic sites . Large chromosomal deletions induced by RGEN RNPs We and others have shown that the repair of two concurrent DSBs produced by ZFNs and TALENs gives rise to targeted chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions , inversions , and translocations ( Brunet et al . 2009 ; Lee et al . 2010 , 2012 ; Carlson et al . 2012 ; Kim et al . 2013a ) . Likewise , transfection of plasmids that encode Cas9 andsgRNAintohumancellscancausechromosomaldeletionsand translocations in a targeted manner . We tested whether RGEN RNPs can induce large chromosomal deletions in K562 cells . As expected , use of two sgRNAs whose target sites are separated by 10 - to 100 - kb pairs caused targeted deletions of corresponding chro - mosomal segments ( Fig . 4 ) , demonstrating that RGEN RNP de - livery enables multiplex genome engineering and targeted chro - mosomal rearrangements . Reducing off - target effects of RGENs via RNP delivery RGENs can induce off - target mutations at sites that are highly homologous to on - target sites ( Cradick et al . 2013 ; Fu et al . 2013 ; Hsu et al . 2013 ; Pattanayak et al . 2013 ; Cho et al . 2014 ) . Off - target DNA cleavages by RGENs can cause unwanted chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations ( Cho et al . 2014 ) . We tested whether RNP delivery could reduce off - target effects of RGENs . To Figure 2 . Genome editing in BJ fibroblasts and H9 hES cell lines via direct delivery of RGEN RNPs .

Untransfected , RNP - , and plasmid - transfected ES cell colonies were subjected to AP staining . Kim et al . 1014 Genome Research www . genome . org this end , we chose three RGENs that were previously shown to induce off - target mutations at high frequencies in human cells ( Fu et al . 2013 ; Cho et al . 2014 ) and compared RNP delivery with plasmid transfection . The three RGENs delivered via RNPs were highly active , inducing site - specific mutations at frequencies that ranged from 76 % to 79 % , and discriminated on - target sites from off - target sites more efficiently than did those delivered via plas - mid transfection ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus , no mutations were detected using the T7E1 assay at two off - target sites that differ by 2 nucleotides ( nt ) from the on - target site , when the RGEN specific to the AAVS1 - S3 site was delivered via RNP electroporation . In contrast , the same RGEN delivered via plasmids induced off - target mutations at these sites at frequencies of 6 % and 1 % , respectively . Importantly , RNP delivery did not sacrifice genome - editing activities at on - target sites , while reducing off - target effects . We then used deep sequencing to quantify off - target muta - tions inducedby RGENplasmidsand RNPsmore accurately . Again , the three RGEN RNPs discriminated on - target sites from off - target sites much more efficiently than did plasmid - driven RGENs . Thus , the RGEN RNP specific to the AAVS1 - S3 site induced off - target indels at frequencies of 0 . 15 % and 0 . 06 % . As a result , the ratio of the indel frequency at the on - target site to thatat the two off - target siteswas114and279 , whenRNPsweredelivered , whereastheratio was 12 and 22 , respectively , when plasmids were transfected , demonstrating 9 . 5 - ( 114 / 12 ) and 13 - fold ( 279 / 22 ) differences , re - spectively , between the two methods .

RNA - guided genome editing via Cas9 RNP delivery Genome Research 1015 www . genome . org Kinetics of RGEN RNP - mediated genome editing We performed a time - course T7E1 assay and Western blotting to understand the molecular basis of the discrepancy between RNP and plasmid delivery . The T7E1 assay showed that RGEN RNPs cleaved chromosomal DNA almost immediately after delivery and that the mutation frequency reached a plateau one day after electroporation ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , it took three days to reach an equivalent level of mutations when RGENs were expressed via plasmid transfection . Western blotting analysis showed that Cas9 protein was rapidly degraded in cells when delivered directly : At 24 h post - transfection , Cas9 was barely detected . In contrast , Cas9 protein was expressed from plasmid for several days . Apparently , continuous expression of Cas9 and sgRNA in cells gives rise to the accumulation of off - target mutations . These results are in line with those observed with the direct delivery of ZFNs , which reduces off - target effects ( Gaj et al . 2012 ) . Unlike ZFN production , however , preparation of new RGENs does not require time - consuming , fas - tidious , and labor - intensive stepsto de novoengineer , express , and purify sequence - specific nucleases ( Liu et al . 2014 ) . Discussion RNA - guided genome editing with the repurposed type II CRISPR / Cas system has been transforming almost every discipline in the life sciences , biotechnology , and medicine ( Kim and Kim 2014 ) . Compared with ZFNs and TALENs , RGENs are easy to make , af - fordable , and scalable , lowering barriers to genome editing . How - ever , these programmable nucleasesarelimited byoff - target effects and unwanted integration of plasmid vectors in the genome , un - less mRNA or proteins are used . Furthermore , plasmid transfection is often inefficient and stressful to cells . To sidestep these limita - tions , we delivered RGEN RNPs , rather than plasmids , directly into cells via electroporation and showed that RGEN RNPs enable effi - cient genome editing even in human primary and ES cells that are refractory to DNA transfection , while reducing off - target effects and avoiding unwanted integration of plasmid DNA in the host genome . In an accompanying paper published in this issue , Ramakrishna et al . ( 2014 ) report that a cell - penetrating peptide can be used to deliver both the Cas9 protein and sgRNA into hu - man cells . In principle , Cas9 protein can be replaced with Cas9 mRNA . Unlike mRNA that must be translated in cells , Cas9 protein works immediately after transfection into cells . Furthermore , it is difficult to check the activity of Cas9 mRNA before transfection , whereas the activity of Cas9 protein can be tested easily in vitro before transfection . Cas9 protein can also be used for genotyping of mutations induced by the same RGENs ( Kim et al . 2014 ) . Recently , several groups independently reported that RGENs can cause unwanted mutations at off - target sites that differ by up to 5 nt from on - target sites , raising concerns about their specific - ities ( Cradick et al . 2013 ; Fu et al . 2013 ; Hsu et al . 2013 ; Pattanayak et al . 2013 ) . Off - target effects may result in chromosomal trans - locations , inactivation of tumor suppressor or other essential genes , and activation of oncogenes . We and others have proposed several methods to reduce or avoid off - target effects of RGENs . First , the concentration of sgRNA and Cas9 can be titrated to im - prove the ratio of on - target to off - target mutation rates ( Hsu et al . 2013 ) . Unfortunately , titrating RGEN concentrations also reduces on - target mutation frequencies . Second , the use of guide RNAwith Figure 5 . Off - target mutations caused by RGEN RNPs vs . RGEN plasmids . RGEN RNPs or plasmids that encode Cas9 and sgRNA were electroporated into K562 cells . Mutations were detected using the T7E1 assay ( left ) and deep sequencing ( right ) . The PAM sequence is shown in blue . Mismatched bases are shown in red . Kim et al . 1016 Genome Research www . genome . org two additional guanine bases at the 5 9 end ( that do not match with target DNA sequences ) , termed 5 9 - ggX 20 sgRNA or crRNA , can discriminate on - target sites from off - target sites that differ by 2 nt efficiently without sacrificing on - target activities both in animals ( Cho et al . 2013b ; Sung et al . 2014 ) and in cell lines ( Cho et al . 2013a , 2014 ) . Interestingly , truncated sgRNAs can also decrease undesiredoff - targetmutations , improvingthespecificityofRGENs ( Fu et al . 2014 ) . Third , paired Cas9 nickases ( or RGENickases ) that generate two adjacent single - strand breaks on opposite DNA strands , producing composite DSBs , double the specificity of RNA - guided genomeengineering ( Maliet al . 2013a ; Ranet al . 2013 ; Cho et al . 2014 ) , a strategy adopted from paired zinc finger nickases ( Kim et al . 2012 ) . Fourth , as shown in this study , RGEN RNPs can be used to reduce off - target effects . Last but not least , one should choose unique target sitesthat do not have homologous sequences elsewhere in the genome , a strategy we had used to avoid off - target effects of TALENs ( Kim et al . 2013a ) . A web - based computer pro - gramthatcanbeusedfortheidentificationofsuchsitesisavailable ( Bae et al . 2014 ) . It may even be possible to combine these ap - proaches to avoid off - target effects completely . Thus , delivery of RGENickase RNPs with two ggX 20 sgRNAs to target a unique se - quence in the genome may further reduce off - target effects that persist even with the use of monomeric RGEN RNPs . In conclusion , RGEN RNPs enable efficient and precise ge - nome editing in diverse human cells including recalcitrant pri - mary and pluripotent stem cells , while avoiding unwanted in - tegration of plasmids and reducing off - target effects . We propose that RGEN RNP delivery will broaden the utility of RNA - guided genome engineering not only in basic research but also in bio - medical applications and biotechnology by circumventing regu - latory requirements associated with DNA transfection .
