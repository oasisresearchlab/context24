Printed in Great Britain 3049 Osmotic Adjustment and the Accumulation of Organic Solutes in Whole Cells and Protoplasts of Saccharomyces cevevisiae By AMANDA J . MEIKLE , ROBERT H . REED AND GEOFFREY M . GADD * Department of Biological Sciences , University of Dundee , Dundee DDl 4HN , UK ( Received 25 April 1988 ; revised 28 June 1988 ) In the presence of a suitable carbon source , whole cells and protoplasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthesized glycerol as a compatible organic solute in response to increased external osmotic pressure . Boyle - van’t Hoff plots showed that protoplasts , and non - turgid cells , exhibited a linear relationship between volume and the external osmotic pressure ( i . e . they behaved as near - ideal osmometers ) , and that both protoplasts and cells have a component which is not osmotically responsive - the non - osmotic volume ( NOV ) . Glycerol levels in whole cells and protoplasts were elevated by increased external osmotic pressure over a similar time - scale to the period of exponential cell growth , reaching a maximum value at 6 - 12 h and declining thereafter . This suggests that the restoration of turgor pressure in whole cells was not the sole regulator of glycerol accumulation . Stationary phase whole cells had negligible levels of intracellular glycerol after growth in a medium of raised osmotic pressure . However , intracellular trehalose synthesis in these cells began earlier and reached a higher maximum level than in basal medium . Once exponential growth had stopped , cell turgor and internal osmotic pressure decreased somewhat . These new , lower values may be determined by the extent of trehalose accumulation in stationary phase cells . INTRODUCTION The ability of organisms to grow under conditions of elevated osmotic pressure has received much attention with respect to general aspects of physiology and biochemistry ( Brown , 1976 , 1978 ; Jennings , 1983 ; Munns et al . , 1983 ; Vreeland , 1987 ) , food science ( Onishi , 1963 ) , and industrial potential ( Ben - Amotz & Avron , 1983 ) . During growth , a walled cell will have an internal osmotic pressure greater than the external osmotic pressure . The consequent tendency for water to flow into the cell , leading to an increase in volume , is opposed by the stretched cell wall , generating a turgor pressure within . Since the elasticity of the cell wall varies in different organisms , the extension needed to generate a suitable turgor pressure may range widely for differing cell types ( Nobel , 1983 ) . If the external osmotic pressure increases , water flows out , volume and turgor decrease and the cell shrinks until a new osmotic equilibrium is reached . Many algal cells treated in this way have been shown to recover their initial turgor ( Cram , 1976 ) . This is achieved by the accumulation of solutes , by either transport or biochemical interconversions , raising the internal osmotic pressure which leads to the flow of water into the cell and subsequent restoration of cell turgor . Such walled cells operate a system of turgor regulation . In wall - less cells , the plasma membrane can sustain only a negligible hydrostatic pressure . Wall - less micro - organisms in a hypo - osmotic medium ( such as a fresh water environment ) regulate their volume using contractile vacuoles to expel excess fluid accumulated due to the osmotic imbalance between the cell interior and the external medium . In micro - organisms growing in a saline medium ( such as a marine environment ) the internal and external osmotic ~ Abbreviation : NOV , non - osmotic volume . 0001 - 4854 0 1988 SGM Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Sun , 27 Jan 2019 22 : 10 : 51 3050 A . J . MEIKLE , R . H . REED A N D G . M . G A D D pressures are effectively equal , and contractile vacuoles are not required . In response to hyperosmotic treatment wall - less organisms may regulate their volume by the accumulation of solutes within the cell , accompanied by an osmotically driven inflow of water and an increase in cell volume at an essentially constant internal osmotic pressure . Thus wall - less cells show volume regulation ( Cram , 1976 ; Reed , 1984 ) . Accordingly , cell osmotic relations involve these two parameters , i . e . cell volume and cell turgor pressure . Walled micro - organisms have a certain degree of elasticity , described by the volumetric elastic modulus ( E ) , which governs the fractional change in volume for any given change in turgor ( Nobel , 1983 ) , and therefore changes in volume and in turgor pressure must be considered when looking at the osmotic adjustment made by such cells . The elastic modulus is an important parameter in cell water relations since it determines the degree of changes in cell turgor pressure and volume caused by a given change in external osmotic pressure ( Dainty , 1972 ) . In most organisms that grow under conditions of high osmotic pressure , the internal osmotic pressure is generated largely by the intracellular accumulation of one or more low molecular mass organic solutes . Osmotic adjustment of intracellular organic solutes has been reported for a wide range of micro - organisms , including bacteria ( Measures , 1975 ) , cyanobacteria ( Reed et al . , 1984a , b ; Mackay , et al . , 1984 ) , fungi ( Brown & Simpson , 1972 ; Jennings , 1983 ; Gadd et al . , 1984 ) and micro - algae ( Hellebust , 1976 ) . Several Gudies have shown that osmotically stressed yeasts accumulate polyols , particularly glycerol and arabitol ( Borowitzka & Brown , 1974 ; Gustaffson , 1979 ; Jennings , 1984 ; Adler et al . , 1985 ; Hocking , 1986 ) . There are other carbohydrates which may make a considerable contribution to intracellular osmotic pressure in yeasts , but do not respond to changes in the osmolality of the external environment ( Jennings , 1983 ) . In contrast , compounds such as glycerol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have an important role in osmotic adjustment since their intracellular concentration and absolute quantity varies with the external osmotic pressure . All known osmoresponsive solutes ( or osmolytes ) fit , to varying degrees , the definition of a compatible solute proposed by Brown & Simpson ( 1972 ) . Compatible solutes are low molecular mass , neutral compounds which may be accumulated to high intracellular concentrations while causing little enzyme inhibition . Not all organic compatible solutes are carbohydrates ( Borowitzka , 1985 ) ; other classes include amino acids , tertiary sulphonium compounds and quaternary ammonium compounds ( including betaines ) . Although the mechanisms of action of these compatible solutes have not been fully elucidated in all cases , Low ( 1985 ) has reviewed the current models for compatible solute function , noting that these compounds are preferentially excluded from the hydration spheres of proteins , promoting subunit assembly , stabilizing against denaturation and activating enzymes in the presence of denaturing solutes . Thus , Arakawa & Timasheff ( 1 985 ) describe the protein - preferential hydration induced by certain neutral osmolytes upon lysozyme . Le Ruddier et al . ( 1984 ) discuss the molecular biology of the osm ( osmotic tolerance ) genes that protect bacteria such as Escherichia coli against osmotic stress and suggest that they may work in a similar manner with respect to drought resistance . Crowe et al . ( 1984a , 6 ) have since shown that several carbohydrates are able to preserve membrane structure and function under conditions of desiccation . Cells of S . cerevisiae accumulate osmotically significant quantities of glycerol in response to hyperosmotic shock ( Edgley & Brown , 1983 ; Reed et al . , 1987 ) . However the regulatory processes involved in such osmotic adjustment are , as yet , unclear . Bearing in mind that osmotic adjustment in yeast cells must involve volume and turgor pressure changes , we have studied the effects of hyperosmotic media on volume change and osmolyte accumulation in whole cells and protoplasts of S . cerevisiae . Since protoplasts are wall - less and are effectively non - turgid , if the restoration of a positive turgor pressure was required to control osmolyte ( glycerol ) accumulation then one would expect a sustained increase in protoplast internal solute levels . In contrast , an osmolyte - accumulating mechanism controlled with respect to volume would be operable . A comparison of the osmotic responses of whole cells and protoplasts may therefore be useful in assessing the significance of turgor and / or volume regulation in yeasts .

Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( X2180 - 1B ; Yeast Genetic Stock Center , Berkeley , Calif . , USA ) , was maintained at 25 " C on MYGP agar , of composition ( g 1 - l ) : malt extract ( Lab M ) 3 ; yeast extract ( Difco ) , 3 ; bacteriological peptone ( Oxoid ) , 5 ; Dglucose , 10 ; agar ( Lab M , no . 2 ) , 15 . The liquid basal medium ( BM ) had the following composition ( g 1 - l ) : D - glucose , 20 . 0 ; KH2P0 , , 2 . 72 ; K2HP04 . 3H20 , 5 . 22 ; ( NH4hSO4 , 2 . 0 ; MgSO , . 7H20 , 0 . 12 ; FeSO , . 7H20 , 0 . 0022 ; ZnSO , . 7H20 , 0 . 004 ; MnSO , . 4H20 , 0 . 004 ; CuSO , . 5H20 , 0 . 0004 ; yeast extract ( Difco ) , 1 . 0 . Starter cultures were prepared by loop - inoculating 100 ml of culture medium ( BM ) with cells from an MYGP agar plate and incubating for 18 h at 25 " C on an orbital shaker ( 100 cycles min - I ) . Exponentially growing starter cultures were used , after one further subculture ( 12 h ) , to inoculate experimental flasks , These were incubated as above and contained 100 ml or 250 ml of basal medium ( BM ; total osmotic pressure 0 . 72 MPa ) or with added NaCl at 2 . 28 % ( w / v ) ( BM + 0 . 39 M - NaCl ; total osmotic pressure 2 - 48 MPa ) or D - sorbitol at 12 % ( w / v ) ( BM + 0 - 66 M - sorbitol ; total osmotic pressure 2 . 48 MPa ) . The osmotic pressures of experimental solutions were calculated from published tables ( Wolf et al . , 1979 ) and confirmed during experimental procedures using a cryoscopic osmometer ( Osmomat 030 , Gonotec ) . Determination of cell number , cell volume and non - osmotic volume . Whole cells , and protoplasts , were counted and sized using a Coulter ZB ( 1 ) counter and ClOOO Channelyzer linked to an Acorn microcomputer to facilitate estimation of mean cell volume ( Reed etal . , 1985 ) . A 50 pm aperture ( path length , 60 pm ) was used throughout . To prevent volume changes during analysis , cells were counted and sized in an iso - osmotic NaCl solution and the osmotic pressure was the same on both sides of the aperture tube ( Reed et al . , 1987 ) . For each value of mean cell volume , three to five replicates were used , with 15000 - 20000 cells per 0 . 05 ml sample . Instrument settings were [ ZB ( I ) unit ] : l / amplification = 2 , l / aperture current = 0 . 354 , lower thresh - old = 5 , volume constant ( K , ) = 2 . 2 ( matching switch , 5k ) . Size distributions were obtained using the ClOOO Channelyzer unit , at a base channel threshold of 5 and a window width of 100 . These adjustments typically gave a unimodal ( lOO % ) volume peak for cells of S . cerevisiue in channel 29 - 32 , decreasing to < 1 % at the upper and lower Channelyzer settings . The Channelyzer display thus encompassed a wide enough range of volume ( 21 - fold , between base channel threshold and upper setting ) to include newly formed cells and mature cells with buds . To calculate the cell turgor pressure ( Pee , , ) , volumetric elastic modulus ( E ) and the non - osmotic volume ( NOV ) of whole cells , the Boyle - van ' t Hoff relationship was used . Cells were suspended in NaCl solutions , with osmotic pressures ranging from 0 . 72 - 9 - 92 MPa , for 1 - 2 rnin at room temperature to allow for shrinkage ( Morris et al . , 1986 ) and volumes were then measured . The cell volume was then plotted against the reciprocal of the corresponding external osmotic pressure . For protoplast volume analysis the first external osmotic pressure used was iso - osmotic with that of the medium in which the protoplasts were made ( 4 . 36MPa ) . Dilutions of the protoplast suspension were made by dropwise addition of distilled water and , at appropriate dilutions , a 0 . 1 ml sample was transferred to 25 ml of iso - osmotic NaCl for 1 min at 25 " C . The protoplast volume was then measured in this solution . After each volume analysis 1 ml of this diluted protoplast suspension was spun down ( 1300 g , 30 s ) and the osmotic pressure of the supernate measured using a cryoscopic osmometer . Analysis of low molecular mass carbohydrates . Samples of approximately 5 x lo7 cells were filtered onto glassfibre filter discs of 25 mm diameter ( type GF / C , Whatman ) or a similar number of protoplasts were sampled by low - speed centrifugation ( 250 g , 5 min ) . In both cases , samples were washed three times with 10 ml iso - osmotic NaCl solution to remove extracellular carbohydrates , without administering a hypo - osmotic shock ( see Wethered et al . , 1985 ) and then immediately extracted in 80 % ( v / v ) aqueous ethanol using 0 . 6 mg erythritol as an internal standard for monosaccharides / polyols and 0 . 6 mg sucrose as an internal standard for disaccharides . After overnight extraction , ethanol was evaporated off and the samples were desiccated for at least 24 h prior to gas - liquid chromatography using trimethylsilyl - derivatized samples extracted in pyridine ( Reed et al . , 1984b ) . A glass column ( 2m x 4mm ) of Chromosorb W ( Phase Separations ) coated with a stationary phase of 4 % SE52 methylphenyl silicone gum ( Pye Unicam ) was fitted to a Varian 3700 gas - liquid chromatograph with flame ionization detection . A temperature programme from 140 - 280 " C at 20 " C min - ' , holding the initial temperature constant for 1 min and the final temperature constant for 6 min was used . Carbohydrates were identified and peak areas quantified using a Hewlett Packard HP3390A integrator . Isolation of yeast protoplasts . Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 1 200 g , 5 rnin ) , washed twice with , and suspended at lo8 cells ml - l in , a solution comprising 100 mM - MES / KOH buffer ( PH 6 ) in 2143 % ( w / v ) ( 1 - 2 M ) sorbitol ( PM ) giving an osmotic pressure of 4 . 36 MPa . Novozym 234 ( Novo Enzymes ) was added at 10 mg ml - ' ( PM + Novozym ) and the suspension incubated at 25 " C wlth stirring for 1 h ( White & Gadd , 1987 ) . This method was shown to be 299 % efficient by counting with a haemocytometer the number of cells remaining after a 1 in 10 dilution with distilled water and comparing this to the number of cells / protoplasts after a 1 in 10 dilution with PM . Protoplasts were then harvested by low - speed centrifugation ( 250g , 5 min ) , washed once with , and stored in , 20 mM - MES / KOH buffer ( pH 6 ) in 21 . 8 % sorbitol at 4 " C for no longer than 4 h .

G A D D A medium of similar osmotic pressure , but with added glucose ( GPM ) and mineral salts at BM concentrations was also used and the sorbitol level in this medium was reduced to 18 . 5 % ( w / v ) ( 0 . 85 M ) , giving an osmotic pressure of 4 . 20 MPa . Glycerol production by protoplasts . Protoplasts were prepared in PM + Novozym ( I h ) and then incubated at 25 " C either in PM ( pH 6 ) or in GPM ( pH 6 ) , the latter having glucose as a carbon source . As a control , whole cells were also incubated in the above media with the omission of Novozym 234 ( i . e . PM and GPM ) . Protoplast samples ( 3 x 107 - 108 ) were harvested by low - speed centrifugation ( 250 g , 5 min ) and analysed for low molecular mass carbohydrates as described above . Microscopic examinations were made of the protoplasts to check morphology and osmotic sensitivity throughout the time - course . RESULTS Osmotically induced volume changes in whole cells and protoplasts The relationship between volume and external osmotic pressure for whole cells and protoplasts of S . cerevisiae is shown in Fig . 1 . With increasing external osmotic pressure whole cells did not behave as ideal osmometers until their cell turgor pressure had been dissipated at an external osmotic pressure of 2 . 48 MPa . At osmotic pressures above this value the cells showed osmometric behaviour , with a linear relationship between volume and the reciprocal of the external osmotic pressure . Protoplasts , lacking a cell wall , had no appreciable turgor pressure and showed osmometric behaviour over a wider range of external osmotic pressures . With increasing dilution , protoplast lysis was observed microscopically at an external osmotic pressure of approximately 1 . 29 MPa , presumably due to excessive volume increase caused by the inflow of water from the dilute medium . At lower osmolalities the protoplast volume decreased substantially , reaching 25 fl at 0 . 92 MPa ( Fig . 1 ) . Further reductions in external osmolality caused extensive lysis and satisfactory volume distributions could not be obtained using the Channelyzer . The Boyle - van ' t Hoff plots ( Fig . 1 ) can be used to derive the non - osmotic volume ( NOV ) , internal osmotic pressure ( ni ) , and cell turgor pressure ( Pcell ) at any given external osmotic pressure ( n , ) and the volumetric elastic modulus ( E ) . Linear regression analysis ( correlation coefficient 2 0 . 970 in all cases ) was used to calculate the NOV of both cell types as the intercept of the y - axis . Whole cells had a NOV of 48 % of their initial volume in basal medium ( BM ) ; protoplasts had a NOV of 35 % of the original protoplast volume in 1 . 2 M - sorbitol , pH 6 . 0 ( PM ) . Calculation of the internal osmotic pressure of cells at any given n , uses the relationship Pcell = n , - n , ( Dainty , 1976 ) . Therefore , when Pcell = 0 , at high ne , ni = n , . Having thus calculated a value for q , at a volume where Pcell = 0 , the Boyle - van ' t HOE relationship ( nV = constant ) can then be applied , where V = the osmotically active volume , to calculate ni where the cell has positive turgor pressure . Thus Pcell can be calculated for all points on the Boyle - van ' t Hoff plot . Finally , E can be calculated as where V is the total cell volume and V , is a reference volume , usually the cell volume where Pcell = 0 ( see Dainty , 1976 ) . Tables 1 and 2 give values for cell volume , Pcell and ni , at given external osmotic pressures , for mid - exponential phase ( 1 1 h ) and stationary phase ( 5 d ) yeast cells respectively . In stationary phase cells in basal medium ( n , = 0 . 72 MPa ) , with no requirement for positive turgor for growth , the turgor pressure was lower than in mid - exponential phase cells . Stationary phase cells also had a lower mean elastic modulus of 1 - 95 MPa , compared to mid - exponential cells ( 3 . 25 MPa ) . These values for E were calculated over the range of ne where Pcell > 0 . In both cases as n , increased , cell volume and Pcell decreased while ni increased , until , at an n , of 2 . 48 MPa , Pcell was dissipated and ni = n , . The volumes of whole cells and protoplasts in a hyperosmotic medium , with and without added glucose ( i . e . PM and GPM respectively ) , were monitored using the Coulter counter over 12 h . In all cases , the volumes after 1 h in a hyperosmotic medium were lower than the original Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Sun , 27 Jan 2019 22 : 10 : 51 Osmotic adjustment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3053 60 55 5 50 h w 2 45 - 9 40 2 35 3 30 e - - ? 25 20 2 15 10 5 w a - w - 0 . 20 0 . 60 1 . 00 1 . 40 0 . 40 0 . 80 1 . 20 l / External osmotic pressure ( MPa ~ ' ) Fig . 1 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 Time ( h ) Fig . 2 Fig . 1 .

Without glucose , neither whole cells nor protoplasts increased their volume ; protoplasts in a medium with no added glucose lysed after 7 h ( Fig . 2 ) . However , the volumes of protoplasts and cells were higher after 1 h in the medium with added glucose . Furthermore , whole cells showed a small increase in volume after 1 h , and protoplasts showed a sustained increase in volume after 4 h . After 21 . 5 h in GPM the protoplasts remained intact , and were still osmotically sensitive and thus had not regenerated a cell wall . These protoplasts were substantially larger ( 166 fl ) than at 12 h and microscopic examination showed that they had large vacuoles which occupied most of their volume . Glycerol production by protoplasts and whole cells When incubated in PM neither protoplasts nor whole cells synthesized glycerol , nor any other low molecular mass carbohydrate . Fig . 3 ( a , b ) shows the accumulation of carbohydrates by protoplasts and whole cells respectively , when incubated in GPM . Maximum internal glycerol levels were reached in protoplasts and whole cells after 6 h in GPM , after which they decreased . Protoplasts appeared to produce more glycerol than whole cells . Low levels of sorbitol were detected within protoplasts and cells , presumably due to uptake from the medium . Maximum sorbitol levels were reached after 4 h in protoplasts and 6 h in cells ; these levels did not exceed 10 fmol ( cell / protoplast ) - l and did not contribute to the overall internal osmotic pressure to the same extent as glycerol . Protoplasts did not synthesize trehalose during this experiment , whereas whole cells showed trehalose synthesis in GPM after 6 h . Efect of diferent osrnotica on glycerol production by whole cells S . cerevisiae cells were inoculated from BM into BM + NaCl .

However , the addition of 2 . 28 % ( w / v ) NaCl would have increased the osmotic pressure of the medium from 0 . 72 MPa to 2 . 48 MPa which would have dissipated cell turgor ( Table 1 ) . Thus the cells must have restored turgor , presumably by glycerol synthesis , before expansion growth could occur . The volume of these cells increased between 1 and 3 h after inoculation ( the initial osmotically induced shrinkage , shown in Fig . 1 , is not represented on this graph ) , and subsequently decreased during mid - exponential phase . In control cells a similar sequence occurred , although the cell volume generally remained higher during the exponential phase , declining in the stationary phase . Fig , 4 ( b ) shows that glycerol was synthesized rapidly by exponentially growing cells in BM + NaCl and decreased at the end of exponential growth . Control cells transferred to BM did not synthesize significant amounts of glycerol . Cells grown in BM + NaCl showed synthesis of trehalose by 1 d , reaching a higher intracellular level than control cells in BM , which showed no trehalose synthesis until 2 d . The results obtained when cells of S . cerevisiae were inoculated into medium with an osmotic pressure elevated to 2 . 48 MPa with D - sorbitol ( BM + sorbitol ) are shown in Fig . 5 ( a , b ) . The doubling time for these cells was 1 . 9 h , as compared to 2 . 0 h in BM ( in Fig . 4a ) . Cell volume was increased at 1 h and 3 h after inoculation and then decreased , as in NaCl . Glycerol was synthesized to a level somewhat higher than that of NaC1 - treated cells ( Fig . 4b ) . However , synthesis was more rapid and the maximum internal concentration was reached after 6 h in BM + sorbitol ( Fig . 5 b ) as compared to 12 h in NaCl ( Fig . 4 b ) . The glycerol level then dropped , Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Sun , 27 Jan 2019 22 : 10 : 51 3056 A . I . MEIKLE , R . H . REED A N D G . M . G A D D although not as rapidly as in NaC1 , since low levels of glycerol were still detectable at 6 d . Trehalose synthesis was observed at 1 d with higher levels for sorbitol - treated cells than those for control cells , particularly towards the end of the experiment . When exponential phase cells , grown for two previous subcultures in BM + NaC1 , were transferred to fresh medium of identical composition , a doubling time of 2 . 6 h was observed ( Fig . 6a ) . Cell volume changed over the first 12 h , in a similar manner to control cells ( Fig . 4a ) , and then decreased at the start of stationary phase . Since the cells were transferred from BM + NaC1 , the initial intracellular glycerol concentration was high . However , transfer to fresh , iso - osmotic BM + NaCl medium resulted in a marked decrease in the internal glycerol level at 1 h which then rapidly recovered and was maintained until the end of exponential growth . Intracellular glycerol then decreased and was undetectable by 7 d . Intracellular trehalose was observed at 24 h and increased during stationary phase to levels higher than those reached by control cells in BM ( Fig . 4b ) . DISCUSSION From the Boyle - van ' t Hoff plots ( Fig . 1 ) it is clear that whole cells maintained a positive turgor pressure when transferred to NaCl solutions of elevated osmotic pressure up to 2 - 48 MPa ; at this point cell turgor became zero and the cells behaved as osmometers . Arnold & Lacy ( 1977 ) calculated that incipient plasmolysis ( P , , , , = 0 ) occurred in S . cerevisiae at a similar osmotic pressure of 2 . 85 MPa , from changes in the Ficoll - accessible space of the cells with increasing external osmotic pressure . In contrast , protoplasts showed osmometric behaviour over a wider range of osmotic pressures , since they were not able to generate a significant turgor pressure . Whole cells had a larger NOV than protoplasts in proportional and absolute terms ( Fig . l ) , suggesting that some of this NOV may consist of cell wall material . The exact nature of the remaining component of the NOV is not known ; however , organelles and storage granules may also contribute . Reed et al . ( 1987 ) calculated a NOV of 34 % for S . cerevisiae cells using the data of Arnold & Lacy ( 1977 ) , in accordance with a value of 35 % calculated for late - exponential phase cells by Morris et al . ( 1986 ) . The values for NOV of mid - exponential and stationary phase cells shown in Tables 1 and 2 are somewhat higher . The work by Morris et al . ( 1986 ) used video microscopy to reveal that shrinkage occurred within the first minute of exposure to a hyperosmotic solution of NaCl at 20 " C , and that the cell volume then remained stable for up to 5 min . The changes in linear dimensions of cells of S . cerevisiae during shrinkage were not isotropic ; this increases the difficulties involved in volume calculations from this technique . Such non - isotropic shrinkage does not significantly affect volume analysis using the Coulter counter . When whole cells were transferred to media of increasing osmotic pressure there was a movement of water from the cells to the medium and hence a decrease in volume ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . While the internal osmotic pressure was higher than the external osmotic pressure , a positive turgor pressure ( Pcell ) was maintained . In agreement with Morris et al . ( 1986 ) plasmolysis was not observed in whole cells in extreme hyperosmotic media , when examined by light microscopy ; it is likely that the yeast cell wall shrinks with the protoplast when the cell turgor pressure has been dissipated by elevated external osmotic pressure ( i . e . > 2 . 48 MPa ) . In BM the internal osmotic pressure of exponentially growing whole cells was 1 - 53 MPa ( Table 1 ) which agrees with the value of 1 . 34 MPa obtained by Levin et al . ( 1979 ) and 1 - 20 MPa , calculated from the data of Arnold & Lacy ( 1977 ) for yeast cells in distilled water ; these cells are likely to have a lower ni due to the leakage of certain internal solutes from the cells in distilled water ( Wethered et al . , 1985 ) . While the values of Levin et al . ( 1979 ) and Arnold & Lacy ( 1977 ) will also be equivalent to the cell turgor pressure , since ne = O , the turgor pressure obtained during the present study for exponentially growing cells in BM ( ne = 0 . 72 MPa ) was 0 . 81 MPa ( Table l ) , a lower value than for yeast cells in distilled water . However , an increase in the turgidity of cells would be expected when suspended in distilled water . In BM , stationary phase cells had a lower Pcell of 0 . 61 MPa . This is expected as stationary phase cells no longer require a critical Pcell to drive cell expansion . Cells growing exponentially in BM had an E of 3 - 25 MPa ; a similar range of Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Sun , 27 Jan 2019 22 : 10 : 51 Osmotic adjustment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3057 values for E ( 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 MPa ) has been calculated from a Boyle - van ' t Hoff plot of the data of Arnold 8z Lacy ( 1977 ) . Levin et al . ( 1979 ) derived a somewhat higher value for E of 4 . 7 MPa from the data of Conway 8z Armstrong ( 1961 ) , indicating a less elastic cell wall than suggested by our data . Differences in strain history , media and the techniques used undoubtedly account for some of the variation in E . The elastic modulus varied with culture age , with a higher value during exponential growth and decreasing in stationary phase . This is likely to be related to the lower turgor of stationary phase cells , and to changes in cell wall composition with age . Yeast protoplasts are normally stored at 4 " C to inhibit metabolic activity which can lead to lysis ( Indge , 1968 ) . However , protoplasts can regenerate cell walls under suitable conditions and recommence growth ( NeEas , 1979 ) . Kotyk et al . ( 1985 ) compared the transport properties of S . cerevisiae protoplasts with intact cells and found that constitutive monosaccharide transport ( e . g . D - xylose ) , as well as the inducible transport of D - galactose , were unaltered in protoplasts . They also showed that the utilization of glucose was not depressed , but protoplast proton - trapslocating capacity was impaired . The present study examined specific aspects of protoplast metabolism with respect to the high osmotic pressure of the medium necessary to compensate for cell wall removal ( i . e . 4 - 20 - 4 . 36 MPa ) . Both whole cells and protoplasts produced glycerol internally in this medium if supplied with glucose . When glycerol was synthesized there was a concurrent increase in protoplast volume ( Figs 2 and 3 ) ; no volume increase was seen in protoplasts incubated in the absence of glucose . Although protoplast glycerol levels decreased after 6 h ( Fig . 3a ) and thus appeared to be controlled by processes other than turgor regulation , protoplast volume did not show a similar change . After 21 . 5 h protoplasts incubated with glucose increased their volume , contained large vacuoles and remained osmotically fragile . These results indicate that S . cerevisiae protoplasts were able to accumulate osmotica in the presence of glucose and thus increase their volume . The decrease in intracellular glycerol after 6 h may be due to changes in glycerol metabolism , or the leakage of intracellular glycerol into the medium . In either case , other solutes must be involved in generating ni after 6 h ; these may include sorbitol ( Fig . 3 ) and / or inorganic ions from the external medium . These results contrast with the observations of Clint ( 1985 ) on Commelina communis guard cell protoplasts , which regulated their volume within narrow limits over a range of external osmotic pressures if incubated for several hours in the presence of added external KC1 . It is also interesting to note that under these conditions whole cells of S . cerevisiae began to produce trehalose after 6 h in GPM ; no trehalose synthesis was seen in protoplasts up to 12 h ( Fig . 3 ) . That whole cells began to produce trehalose after 6 h in GPM ( 71 , = 4 - 36 MPa ) indicates that increased osmotic stress may lead to early trehalose synthesis since trehalose was synthesized after 24 h by cells in BM + NaCl ( n , = 2 . 48 MPa ; Figs 4b and 6b ) and by cells in BM + sorbitol ( n , = 2 - 48 MPa ; Fig . 5b ) as compared to 48 h by cells in basal medium ( n , = 0 . 72 MPa ; Fig . 4b ) . In addition to this early synthesis trehalose reached a higher maximum level in cells grown in media with elevated osmotic pressure . This was most apparent in BM + sorbitol , although it is possible that the cells were able to utilize sorbitol to synthesize trehalose ( see Quain 8z Bolton , 1987 ) . The accumulation of trehalose may be associated with periods of reduced growth rate , and in S . cerevisiae only when glucose is exhausted are cells able to accumulate trehalose in significant amounts ( see Panek , 1985 ; Gadd , 1988 ) . Trehalose is known to have protective properties in desiccated cells ( Panek , 1985 ; Gadd et al . , 1987 ) and has been reported as an osmolyte in cyanobacteria ( Reed et al . , 1984b ) and E . coli ( Larsen et al . , 1987 ) . In whole cells , zero turgor pressure was reached on transfer to a solution with an osmotic pressure of 2 - 48 MPa ( Fig . 1 ) . When transferred to BM + NaCl at this osmotic pressure whole cells of S . cerevisiae synthesized glycerol as their compatible organic solute . Brown et al . ( 1986 ) published data for glycerol accumulation in S . cerevisiae transferred to 8 % ( w / v ) NaCl ( n , = 6 . 8 MPa ) showing that the osmotically induced response did not begin until 6 h after initial exposure and was preceded by a transient , smaller initial increase in glycerol . Our data show that glycerol was accumulated after 1 h in NaC1 - containing medium and continued until the end of the exponential phase ( Fig . 46 ) . However , Brown et al . ( 1986 ) used a synthetic medium containing 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) glucose whereas BM + NaCl contained 2 % ( w / v ) glucose . Also BM + NaCl had a lower external osmotic pressure of 2 - 48 MPa . AndrC et al . ( 1988 ) have Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Sun , 27 Jan 2019 22 : 10 : 51 3058 A . J . MEIKLE , R . H . REED A N D G . M . G A D D demonstrated that increased levels of external NaCl lead to an increased lag phase prior to osmotically induced glycerol production in Debaryomyces hansenii ; a similar phenomenon may occur in S . cerevisiae , accounting for the delay in glycerol synthesis observed by Brown et al . ( 1986 ) . Yagi ( 1988 ) has suggested that in Zygosaccharomyces rouxii a definite intracellular level of glycerol is required prior to initiation of growth in cells stressed using NaC1 , KC1 or MgC12 . This was not observed with S . cerevisiae ( Fig . 4a ) , since transfer of these cells to BM + NaCl with an osmotic pressure of 2 - 48 MPa did not cause a significant lag in growth . Fig . 4 ( a , b ) shows that when whole cells were transferred from BM to BM + NaCl glycerol production began within 1 h , with an increase in cell number at 3 h . However , the cells continued to accumulate glycerol during growth with a maximum internal concentration of approximately 780 mM at 12 h . Data obtained from a Boyle - van ' t Hoff plot of S . cerevisiae 12 h after inoculation from BM intc BM + NaCl ( n , = 2 . 48 MPa ) gave a ni of 3 . 1 1 MPa and a NOV of 47 % ( data not shown ) . Thus the maximum internal glycerol level accounted for 61 . 9 % of the total internal osmotic pressure . A similar situation was seen for cells transferred to BM + sorbitol ( Fig . 5a , b ) . The control for these two experiments ( Fig . 4b ) shows that only small levels of glycerol were accumulated in cells growing exponentially in BM ( i . e . < 100 mM ) . These data suggest that the relationship between glycerol production , turgor regulation and growth in S . cerevisiae may not be as straightforward as that proposed for 2 . rouxii by Yagi ( 1988 ) . The transfer of exponentially growing cells from BM + NaCl to fresh BM + NaCl caused a sudden decrease in intracellular glycerol levels at 1 h ( Fig . 6b ) , which was restored to the initial value within 5 h . It may be that the loss of glycerol occurs during the lag phase , while the production of glycerol is concomitant with growth . Intracellular glycerol levels reached a similar maximum value , of 800 - 900 m ~ , 12 h after transfer from either BM or BM + NaCl to BM + NaCl and similarly decreased at the end of exponential phase . This investigation has demonstrated that the osmotic relations of S . cerevisiae are complex . Since the cell cycle ( NeEas , 1979 ) and some basic aspects of cell metabolism ( Kotyk et al . , 1985 ) are apparently not fundamentally modified in protoplasts , they provide an additional experimental system for elucidating such relations . Protoplasts regulate intracellular levels of glycerol in the absence of a cell wall and this suggests that the restoration of turgor pressure in whole cells is not the sole regulator of glycerol accumulation .
