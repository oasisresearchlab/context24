Abstract Bi - allelic mutations in LRBA ( from Lipopolysaccharide - responsive and beige - like anchor protein ) result in a primary immunodeficiency with clinical features ranging from hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphoproliferative syndrome to inflammatory bowel disease and heterogeneous autoimmune manifestations . LRBA deficiency has been shown to affect vesicular trafficking , autophagy and apoptosis , which may lead to alterations of several molecules and processes that play key roles for immunity . In this review , we will discuss the relationship of LRBA with the endovesicular system in the context of receptor trafficking , autophagy and apoptosis . Since these mechanisms of homeostasis are inherent to all living cells and not only limited to the immune system and also , because they are involved in physiological as well as pathological processes such as embryogenesis or tumoral transformation , we envisage advancing in the identification of potential pharmacological agents to manipulate these processes . Martínez JC / et al / Colombia Médica - Vol . 49 Nº3 2018 ( Jul - Sep ) 237 Introduction More than 400 genes have been reported to affect the immune system either quantitative and / or qualitatively and also , in a symptomatic manner 1 . Among them is included LRBA ( Lipopolysaccharide - responsive and beige - like anchor protein ) ; either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in this gene cause loss of LRBA protein expression , which is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical and immunological manifestations 1 . The first report on LRBA deficiency was performed in five patients from four consanguineous families with hypogammaglobulinemia , autoimmune manifestations and recurrent infections 2 . Subsequently , several reports of individuals with LRBA deficiency have been published , who suffer from a wider spectrum of clinical manifestations including : increased susceptibility to infections , polyautoimmunity , lymphoproliferation and gastropathy , all associated or not with hypogamaglobulinemia 3 - 5 . Moreover , an asymptomatic individual has also been reported 6 . With regard to the immunological findings , T lymphocytes from patients with the LRBA deficiency presented with an increase in either starvation - or staurosporine - induced and controversially , a decrease in Fas - induced apoptosis ( Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinases and activator of caspases ) 7 . Furthermore , a decrease in the expression of CTLA - 4 ( Cytotoxic T - Lymphocyte Antigen 4 ) was described in these cells , both in the surface membrane and intracellularly 8 . In B cells from patients , a decrease in the in vitro production of antibodies was observed , together with an increase in apoptosis and a defect in the starvation - induced autophagy 2 . Taken together , these studies suggest that LRBA is important for the humoral response , immune regulation and defense against infections , both for extracellular and intracellular microorganisms , influencing the survival and homeostasis of T and B cells . LRBA : general characteristics LRBA is located on chromosome 4q31 . 3 and comprises 750 , 839 bp along 58 exons . The protein contains 2 , 863 amino acids and has a molecular mass of ~ 319 kDa ( Fig . 1 ) . Three different transcripts of 1344 , 836 and 787 bp has been detected in different mice tissues 9 . Additionally , the expression of the LRBA messenger RNA ( mRNA ) increases 2 - 4 times after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in different cell lines 9 . This protein has different domains and among them , the BEACH domain ( beige and Chediak - Higashi ) is the most characterized . This domain , with ~ 280 amino acids in length , is conserved in several proteins grouped overall as the BEACH domain containing proteins ( BDCP ) 10 , and is mostly located towards the C - terminal 11 , 12 . The function of this domain is unknown and the sequence does not show homology with any other protein in the human proteome database 11 , 12 . In addition to the BEACH domain , the BDCP shares the ConA - like domain ( concanavalin A - like ) , PH ( Pleckstrin homology ) and WD40 ( repeats of tryptophan and aspartic acid ) domains . On the other hand , the domain DUF1088 ( domain of unknown function 1088 ) is shared only by LRBA and its paralog neurobeachin , which may indicate specific functions of these two proteins not shared by other members of the BDCP . In addition to these domains , LRBA seems to contain a VHS domain ( VPS ( vacuolar protein sorting ) - 27 , Hrs ( hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase sustrate ) STAM ( signal transducing adaptor molecule ) domain ) 13 . The possible functions of all these domains are explained in Table 1 . With respect to tissue - specific expression , transcripts of this protein have been observed mainly bone marrow , lymph nodes , spleen , fetal liver , placenta , kidney and pancreas by RT - PCR ( Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ) and qPCR ( quantitative polymerase chain reaction ) 2 . Remarkably , the LRBA expression is not limited to the immune system , and considerably increases in several cancer tissues 14 . These findings suggest that LRBA function is more related to basic cellular mechanisms of growth , development and survival . At the subcellular level , using a probe directed against the LRBA BEACH domain , this protein has been observed in the cytosol , Golgi apparatus and some lysosomes in the LPS - stimulated murine macrophage cell line RAW264 . 7 9 . In addition , with the use of the electron microscopy , LRBA is observed in endoplasmic reticulum , plasma membrane and clathrin - associated endocytic vesicles in the same cell line 9 . LRBA function LRBA participates in vesicular trafficking and receptor recycling CTLA - 4 ( Cytotoxic T - Lymphocyte Antigen 4 ) is a protein receptor located in the plasmatic membrane of activated T cells . It functions to regulate homeostasis and peripheral immunological tolerance through the inhibition of T cell activation , competing with the costimulatory molecule CD28 for the specific ligation of CD80 and CD86 , which are expressed on the surface of antigen - presenting cells 15 . While CD28 resides mainly on the cell surface , CTLA - 4 is located first in intracellular compartments such as Golgi apparatus , endosomes , secretory granules and lysosomes . The T cell receptor ( TCR ) stimulation promotes CTLA - 4 trafficking from vesicular compartments to the cell membrane , however , once it is already in the membrane , this receptor is continuously endocytosed via clathrin - coated vesicles . After endocytosis , some CTLA - 4 molecules are recycled to the cell membrane while others Figure 1 . Schematic representation of LRBA and the coding protein . Human LRBA contains 750 , 839 bp spanning 58 exons . Its cytogenetic location is 4q31 . 3 . The human LRBA protein comprises 2 , 863 amino acids and is composed of multiple domains . The predicted molecular mass is 319 kD . PH H 2 N = VHS DUF1088 BEACH W40 - COOH ConA 5´ 3´ Martínez JC / et al / Colombia Médica - Vol . 49 Nº3 2018 ( Jul - Sep ) 238 are rapidly degraded in lysosomal compartments 16 , 17 . CTLA - 4 contains a small cytoplasmic tail with two tyrosine motifs at position Y201VKM and Y218FIP . Several intracellular proteins bind to the Y201VKM motif , including AP - 1 and AP - 2 ( clathrin - associated adapter ) . AP - 2 mediates the internalization of CTLA - 4 from the cell surface to endosomes and lysosomal compartments whereas AP - 1 regulates CTLA - 4 trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to endosomal compartments and lysosomes for degradation 17 . In a recent study , it was demonstrated that LRBA is necessary for the vesicular trafficking of CTLA - 4 towards the plasma membrane 8 . LRBA regulates the recycling of CTLA - 4 from endosomes to the cell membrane supporting the maintenance of its intracellular levels for the immediate mobilization to the surface membrane , as this molecule is required . Thus , a deficiency of LRBA favors a rapid degradation of CTLA - 4 in the lysosome compartments , with its concomitant decrease both intracellular and extracellularly 8 . This work also demonstrated that LRBA interacts through its ConA - like - and the PH - BEACH domains with the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA - 4 , specifically with the Y201VKM motif . Finally , the silencing of AP - 1 , but not AP - 2 partially rescues the CTLA - 4 loss in the LRBA deficient cells . These results suggest that LRBA blocks the trafficking of CTLA - 4 to lysosomes , competing with AP - 1 for binding to its specific binding motif 8 . Recent findings indicated that Foxp3 + CD4 + cells from LRBA - deficient mouse spleen cells also exhibit an intracellular decrease in CTLA - 4 18 . Other study that demonstrates the LRBA role in vesicular trafficking is related to the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Dominant - negative LRBA mutants decreases the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR 14 . EGFR is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is expressed in a wide variety of tissues , interacting not only with EGF but also with TGF - β ( Transforming growth factor - β ) , and other ligands . This induces the dimerization and trans - auto - phosphorylation of the receptor by recruiting proteins that activate signaling pathways necessary for the proliferation , differentiation , cell growth , migration and inhibition of apoptosis 19 . Similar to CTLA - 4 in lymphocytes , the EGFR expression on the cell surface is regulated by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which leads either to its degradation via the lysosome compartment or its recycling to the cell surface 20 , 21 . Defects in the vesicular trafficking of this receptor result in an aberrant localization , which enhances signaling , allowing the development of cancer 22 . Although it is still not known if LRBA and EGFR interact physically , it has been demonstrated that AP - 2 facilitates endocytosis and trafficking of EGFR by the endocytic route 3 . Finally , LRBA deficient patients exhibited a decrease in apoptosis mediated by the death receptor Fas , as compared to healthy donors 6 . Fas receptor promotes apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway , after binding to Fas ligand ( FasL ) . After this binding , a process of FasL internalization occur , similar to EGFR , which is crucial to trigger apoptosis 24 . To date , it is unknown whether LRBA - deficient patients exhibit alterations in the amount of FasL in the plasmatic membrane , but the increase in serum FasL in these patients could suggest that the LRBA deficiency may have an effect on FasL , similar to CTLA - 4 , regulating its trafficking either towards plasmatic membrane or lysosomes 25 . These evidences suggest that LRBA might be involved in the vesicular trafficking of other receptors in lymphocytes . In LRBA deficient mice , defects have been reported in the phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 ( extracellular signal - regulated kinases ) and AKT in natural killer ( NK ) cells stimulated with anti - NKG2D or anti - NKp46 antibodies , with a significant decrease in the production of IFN - gamma by these cells after stimulation 26 . Although this study did not determine the expression levels of these receptors in LRBA - deficient mice , there is some evidence that the exposure to specific ligands induces the degradation of NKG2D and DAP10 , the intracellular adapter molecule of this receptor in lysosomes 27 . This regulation might be mediated by clathrin 28 . It is not known if LRBA is involved in the intracellular trafficking of these receptors in NK cells . Likewise , considering that the LRBA deficiency leads to defects in antibody responses , it would be also important to consider whether this molecule modulates the expression and function of other receptors whose expression is modulated by vesicular compartments , especially in regard to B cells activation 29 . Despite these studies on the LRBA - mediated modulation of some cellular receptors , little is known about the intracellular pathways that this molecule employ to perform this function . This transport seems to be carried out by the recruitment of proteins in clathrin - coated vesicles , on which the receptors are removed to early endosomes and subsequently degraded by lysosomal enzymes or recycled to the cell surface 30 . AP - 1 is considered necessary for this trafficking . The location of AP - 1 in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes depends on its direct binding to Arf ( ADP - ribosylation factor ) - 1 and specifically in recycling endosomes , to Arf - 6 , among other protein complexes 31 . As already mentioned , LRBA inhibits the degradation of CTLA - 4 in lysosomes by competition with AP - 1 , which suggest that this protein is necessary for mobilization to these compartments 8 . However , the relationship of LRBA with Tabla 1 . General characteristics of the LRBA protein domains Domain Characteristics Reference BEACH It is present in proteins involved in vesicle trafficking , membrane dynamics and receptor signaling 12 , 13 PH Interacts with phosphatidyl - inositol within biological membranes , hetero - trimeric G proteins and protein kinase C . This allows the appropriate targeting of proteins to different cellular compartments or the activation of signal transduction pathways . 54 WD40 Involved in signal transduction , cell cycle control and apoptosis . It allows transient protein - protein interaction or the assembly of protein complexes . 55 ConA - like Participates in trafficking and classification of proteins along the secretory pathway 56 DUF1088 The function of this domain is unknown . However , a penta - arginine sequence located in the DUF1088 domain of NBEA was identified as a potential signal of nuclear localization 57 VHS Located in the N - terminal portion of proteins associated with endocytosis and / or vesicular trafficking . It likely functions as an adapter domain that helps to locate proteins in the cell membrane or in membranes of the endocytic machinery 13 Martínez JC / et al / Colombia Médica - Vol . 49 Nº3 2018 ( Jul - Sep ) 239 the endosomal pathway is unclear . The recycling of receptors also depends on vesicular compartments , and the proteins this required , namely , Arf , enzymes such as phospholipase D and Rab proteins . Interestingly , a study conducted in Drosophila suggests a possible functional interaction between bchs ( blue cheese ) , a member of the BEACH family , and Rab11 32 . These findings suggest that , as well as Rab11 , Bchs could be involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking . Therefore , studies quantifying the expression of the mentioned receptors in LRBA deficient cells ( either by silencing or from patients ) are needed . It would also be useful to use advanced microscopy techniques to investigate the location of LRBA in other organelles involved in this type of trafficking . In addition , studies of co - immunoprecipitation between LRBA and vesicular trafficking proteins , the use of drugs that block this trafficking or the implementation of negative dominant ARFs , phospholipase D or Rab , could expand our knowledge about the interaction of LRBA with other vesicular trafficking molecules and thus determine its relationship with the membrane expression of receptors such as EGFR , Fas or the activating receptors of NK cells , B cells or others in immune cells . LRBA is a molecule involved in autophagy Autophagy is a mechanism of lysosomal degradation by which the cell destroys damaged organelles and microorganisms and helps to recycle macromolecules . In this process , a double membrane of isolation or phagophore is formed near to the target , which is then elongated , surrounding it , to later mature with the assimilation of a cytosolic charge forming the autophagosome . For the maturation to be effective , the autophagosome must be fused with early or late endosomes forming a structure called amphisome 33 , 34 . Finally , the mature autophagosomes fuses with lysosomes to proceed with the degradation of its content by lysosomal proteases and hydrolytic enzymes 35 . Several of the genes homologous to LRBA are involved in autophagy . WDFY3 ( WD and FYVE zinc finger domain containing protein 3 ) encodes a protein that colocalizes with autophagosome markers 36 , 37 . In addition , the PH - BEACH domain interacts with the p62 protein 34 . P62 is a protein located in the autophagosome formation sites and is associated with both LC3 ( microtubule - associated protein 1A / 1B - light chain 3 ) and ubiquitinated proteins 34 , 38 , 39 . LC3 is a cytosolic protein that when conjugated with a phosphatidylethanolamine is recruited to the autophagosome membrane favoring the autophagic influx 34 . On the other hand , defects in the gene mauve ( mv ) in Drosophila , which is ortholog of LYST , affect the autophagosome function 40 . In immortalized B cells from patients with LRBA deficiency , a significant reduction in the autophagy influx in response to starvation , together with an increase in the Golgi apparatus area , accumulation of autophagosomes and the presence of centrioles is observed , in comparison with those cells from healthy individual 2 . These results suggest that the autophagy influx is impaired in the LRBA deficiency , a finding that was demonstrated by a deficient fusion of autophagosome to lysosomes in immortalized B cells from LRBA - deficient patients subjected to starvation 2 . However , what are the possible functions of LRBA in the autophagy influx ? Considering that both , the cell surface receptor trafficking and autophagy need endocytic vesicles , and that LRBA is likely located in these vesicles , a possible hypothesis would be that LRBA facilitates fusion between autophagosomes and the late endosomes , and therefore , the formation of the amphisome . One of the markers of late endosomes is Rab7 and this molecule is required for the formation of amphisomas in CHO cells transfected with the dominant negative mutant of Rab7 , T22N 33 . Another hypothesis is that , in the same manner as the CTLA - 4 vesicular trafficking , also in the context of autophagy in lymphocytes , LRBA would compete with clathrin adapter proteins , regulating this process . This since molecules such as clathrin and its adapter proteins are also important for the autophagic influx 41 , 42 . On the other hand , in silico tools have predicted that LRBA interacts with LC3 13 . In an attempt to associate the defects in autophagy with the clinical characteristics found in LRBA deficiency individuals , it is important to bear in mind that one of the most common clinical manifestations among these individuals is the gastropathy , phenotypically expressed in many cases as Inflammatory Disease Intestinal ( IBD ) or IBD - like disease , a condition characterized by recurrent destructive inflammation in the intestinal tract 3 - 5 . An increase in the production of IL - 1β in the interstitial mucosa has been implicated with uncontrolled inflammation in the course of this disease 43 . Macrophages derived from ATG16L1 ( autophagy - related 16 - like 1 ) - knockout mice present with a defect in autophagy and exhibit a high production of IL - 1β after LPS stimulation 44 . Likewise , the polymorphism rs2241880 in ATG16L1 increased the production of IL - 1β in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with IBD 45 . Autophagy can regulate the production of IL - 1β through two pathways : in the absence of autophagy , defective mitochondria accumulate generating an increase in ROS ( reactivating oxygen species ) and releasing mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm , events that further activate the inflammosome , increasing the production of IL - 1β 46 , 47 . On the other hand , the degradation of pro - IL - 1β mediated by autophagy processes limits the substrate available for the inflammasome , thus regulating the activation of IL - 1β 48 , 49 . Therefore , alterations in autophagy would impair this mechanism , increasing the levels of IL - 1β and inducing inflammation . It is not known if the intestinal manifestations in LRBA deficient patients are mediated by an excessive activity of the inflammosome and exaggerated production of IL - 1β . Microscopy studies with LRBA deficient cells are required to study the intracellular distribution of molecules such as Rab7 and LC3 after the autophagic influx . It would also be interesting to investigate if LRBA interacts physically with any of the Rab molecules involved in the different types of autophagy , by means of co - immunoprecipitation assays . The role of LRBA in inflamosome activity could be addressed by measuring the production of IL - 1β in LRBA deficient phagocytic or intestinal epithelial cells or by determining the activity of active auto - inflammosome by means of redistribution of ASC ( apoptosis - associated speck - like protein containing a caspase - recruitment domain ) , which is a protein that recruits the necessary caspases for the activation of the inflammosome . LRBA participates in apoptosis . In LRBA deficient patients’ immortalized B cells subjected to starvation , a significant increase in apoptosis is observed 2 . Additionally , in LRBA - knockdown HeLa cells exposed to ultraviolet light or staurosporine , a greater cleavage of PARP ( Poly Martínez JC / et al / Colombia Médica - Vol . 49 Nº3 2018 ( Jul - Sep ) 240 ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ) and caspase 3 are observed , events that are necessary to initiate the cascade of signaling that eventually leads to apoptosis 14 . Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death to control development and growth . For long time , caspases have been considered as the proteases involved in the execution of the apoptosis program , and nowadays it is known that the partial destabilization of the lysosomal membrane , with the consequent release of hydrolytic enzymes , can initiate and execute apoptosis , byactivating caspases 50 , 51 . In germinal centers derived from tonsils , it is observed that B cell lysosomal destabilization contributes to apoptosis 50 . The induction of lysosomal damage in these cells resulted in the cleavage of caspase 8 and also of DNA , due to the increased activity of cathepsin B in the cytoplasm . Interestingly , it has been observed that p53 induces lysosomal destabilization 52 and the LRBA promoter is negatively regulated by p53 14 . p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a nuclear transcription factor , whose expression increases in response to damage , blocking the cell cycle either to facilitate DNA repair or to induce apoptosis 52 . It is possible to hypothesize that , p53 would induce lysosomal destabilization in the absence of LRBA , and therefore , trigger apoptosis in lymphocytes . However , the mechanism by which p53 induces lysosomal destabilization or how LRBA protects cells from apoptosis is up to date unknown . However , a complex crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis exists , that is critical for cell fate . Under certain cellular conditions , autophagy can promote cell survival and prevent apoptosis 53 . For example , increased autophagy in cells deprived of nutrients or growth factors allows cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis . A suggested mechanism by which autophagy inhibits apoptosis is the sequestration of mitochondria damaged by the autophagosome , thus preventing the released mitochondrial cytochrome c to form a functional apoptosome in the cytoplasm 53 . However , in other conditions , autophagy may culminate in cell death , dependently or independently of apoptosis 53 . Additionally , there are several proteins that share a dual role in both apoptosis and autophagy 53 . These autophagic proteins positively or negatively regulate mitochondrial apoptosis directly or indirectly through the cleavage of proteases 54 . In the context of LRBA deficient cells , defective autophagy together with an increase in apoptosis has been demonstrated . It is not known if either alterations in the clearance of damaged mitochondria or an exaggerated cleavage of proteases are responsible for this cellular phenotype . Therefore , it is necessary to evaluate the quantity and integrity of the lysosomes in LRBA deficient immune cells . In addition , the kinetics of lysosomal destabilization could be estimated in relation to the kinetics of other apoptotic parameters such as mitochondrial instability , caspase - 3 activation and DNA cleavage . Conclusion In the last decade , a great amount of new information has been generated about the association of LRBA with the immune system , its cellular localization and function . This has improve our understanding about their role in processes such as vesicular trafficking , autophagy and apoptosis . However , many questions remain to be answered . First , is LRBA located in the endomembrane system ? Does LRBA form protein complexes with either Rab or Arf ? Does LRBA modulate the traffic of receptors such as Fas , NKG2D or NKp46 ? There is evidence that LRBA prevents the degradation of CTLA - 4 by competing AP - 1 in human regulatory T lymphocytes , a protein that interacts with Arf1 and Arf6 . In addition , the Bchs ortholog gene in Drosophila leads to Rab11 - dependent vesicular trafficking . This raises the possibility that LRBA modulates several immune receptors by vesicle trafficking and , therefore , it is Figure 2 . LRBA in the regulation of vesicular trafficking . CTLA - 4 is a receptor located in the membrane of activated T lymphocytes . This receptor is internalized in clathrin - coated vesicles by its interaction with AP2 . LRBA regulates the recycling of CTLA - 4 from endosomes to the cell membrane , preventing its degradation in the lysosomal compartments . The appropriate autophagy influx also need the endocytic vesicles . LRBA is located in these vesicles and might interact with molecules not yet identified to facilitate fusion between the autophagosomes and the late endosomes . Martínez JC / et al / Colombia Médica - Vol . 49 Nº3 2018 ( Jul - Sep ) 241 determinant in the normal development of the immune response . Secondly , although defects in LRBA lead to poor autophagy , what are the functions of this protein in these cell mechanism ? What is its localization in autophagosome , amphisomes and autophagolysomomes ? Does LRBA interact physically with autophagy - related molecules such as LC3 , ATG or Rab7 ? , By studying vesicular trafficking and autophagy , we found a possible connection mediated by Rab7 , which is needed for the fusion between late endosomes and the autophagolysosome , which might suggest that LRBA is required for the fusion between these two organelles . Third , can LRBA deficiency affect lysosomal stability and thereby trigger apoptosis ? The interaction of LRBA with lysosomes has been described , however , the mechanism underlying its function in lysosomes have not yet been fully elucidated . Finally , the association between endosomal trafficking , autophagy , apoptosis in the context of the LRBA function have not yet been addressed . We propose a model for the function of LRBA in the CTLA - 4 trafficking ( Fig . 2 ) . A complete understanding of the LRBA function also requires a detailed dissection of its structure . It is necessary to characterize the function of their domains and its interaction with other proteins in cellular homeostasis . New technologies of advanced microscopy , genetic editing such as CRISPR / Cas9 system or next - generation genomics tools , in the context of transcriptomes , proteomes , metabolomes and epigenomes would help to solve many of these questions to clarify the role of this protein and raise strategies for its regulation .
