Dimerization is a key event for EGFR activation , but the role of higher order clustering is unknown . We employed single particle tracking to relate the mobility and aggregation of EGFR to its signaling activity . EGFR mobility alternates between short - lived free , confined and immobile states . In the immobile state , EGFR tends to aggregate in clathrin - coated pits , which is further enhanced in a phosphorylation - dependent manner and does not require ligand binding . EGFR phos - phorylation is further amplified by cross - phosphorylation in clathrin - coated pits . Because phosphorylated receptors can escape from the pits , local gradients of signaling active EGFR are formed . These results show that amplification of EGFR phosphorylation by receptor clustering in clathrin - coated pits supports signal activation at the plasma membrane . Introduction The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR , or ErbB1 ) translates extracellular cues into an intracellular response that triggers a specific physiological output such as proliferation or migration , depending on the cellular context [ 1 , 2 ] . Aberrant activation of EGFR is implicated in tumor development [ 3 ] and its activation mechanisms have been a topic of intense study [ 4 , 5 ] . EGFR responds to the binding of ligand by forming dimers , which activates its kinase domains by an allosteric mechanism [ 6 ] . Dimerization is a key initial step , which was demon - strated initially by biochemical experiments [ 7 ] , and later confirmed in living cells by single molecule imaging [ 8 ] . Structural studies showed that the transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments favor dimerization [ 9 – 11 ] , which is sterically constrained by the extracellular domain PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 1 / 22 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Ibach J , Radon Y , Gelléri M , Sonntag MH , Brunsveld L , Bastiaens PIH , et al .

Ligand binding lifts that constraint by changing the configuration of the extracellular domain from a tethered to an extended geometry [ 4 , 12 , 13 ] . In the ligand - bound dimer , the intracellular kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer , with the ‘ activator ’ kinase functioning as an allosteric activator of the ‘ receiver ’ kinase [ 6 ] . This leads to phosphorylation of multiple residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the activator receptor , which serve as docking sites for effec - tors . These structural studies show a central role for receptor dimerization in the activation of the kinase domains . However , it is not clear if the dimer is also the fundamental unit in terms of the signaling activity of the phosphorylated receptor . For instance , because EGFR dimeriza - tion is transient [ 14 – 16 ] also the phosphorylated monomer could contribute to the signal . Higher order EGFR clusters have also been reported [ 17 – 23 ] but their role in the signaling activity of EGFR is largely unexplored . Higher order clusters have not been studied on a struc - tural level , and it is not clear if EGFR clustering is an intrinsic structural property of the ligand - bound receptor or if it depends on interactions with extrinsic factors other than ligand . EGFR can be phosphorylated in the absence of ligand in spite of the structural constraints that prevent activation of the kinase domains [ 14 , 24 ] . This is possibly supported by an autocat - alytic mechanism where phosphorylation of Tyr845 suppresses the intrinsic disorder of the α C helix in the kinase domain , which leads to a higher dimerization efficiency [ 25 ] . To prevent spurious signaling activity of EGFR , phosphorylation of the receptor is curbed extrinsically by protein tyrosine phosphatases [ 14 , 26 – 29 ] . However , this raises the question if activation of the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor by ligand binding is sufficient to generate a stable level of receptor phosphorylation at the plasma membrane , since the activity of protein tyrosine counteracted phosphatases is two orders of magnitude higher [ 30 , 31 ] . Additional mechanisms that promote EGFR phosphorylation , for instance by spatially tuning the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases [ 32 ] , could compensate for this . Here we investigate if the distribution of the receptor in the plasma membrane is modulated upon ligand binding in order to support phosphorylation of EGFR in a background of phos - phatase activity . In particular , an increase in the local concentration of the receptor by cluster - ing could support EGFR activation at low expression levels by increasing the local kinase density . We employed single particle tracking to study the mobility and aggregation of EGFR , and correlated this with its signaling activity by simultaneously detecting the binding of a phos - photyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domain . We find that the mobility of EGFR alternates between free , confined and immobile states , on a time scale of seconds . After phosphorylation , EGFR tends to aggregate in the immobile state in clathrin - coated pits , where its autophosphorylation is amplified . The clustering of EGFR depends on its phosphorylation and does not require ligand binding . The receptors are able to escape the clathrin - coated pits , which establishes local gradients of mobile phosphorylated EGFR . Interfering with receptor recruitment to clathrin - coated pits substantially delays signal activation , which shows that amplification of receptor phosphorylation in clathrin - coated pits supports EGFR signaling at the plasma membrane . Materials and Methods Reagents Human EGF was purchased from Peprotech ( Hamburg , Germany ) and shock frozen at 100 μ g / ml in PBS + 0 . 1 % BSA .

Constructs To clone SNAP - EGFR , the EGFP in EGFP - EGFR was replaced by a SNAP - tag . The sequence for SNAP was amplified by PCR from pSNAP - tag ( m ) ( NEB , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) with the primers SNAP _ AgeI _ F ( GCG ACC GGT AAT GGA CAA AGA CTG CGA AAT G ) and SNAP _ XhoI _ R ( CTC CTC GAG CAC CCA GCC CAG GCA ) , digested with AgeI ( NEB , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) and XhoI ( NEB , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) and cloned into the AgeI / XhoI restriction sites of the digested EGFP - EGFR plasmid . The point mutation Y1045F was introduced into SNAP - EGFR with the primers Y1045F _ F ( AGC TTC TTG CAG CGA TTC AGC TCA GAC CCC ACA GGC ) and Y1045F _ R ( TCG AAG AAC GTC GCT AAG TCG AGT CTG GGG TGT CCG ) . EGFP - PTB and EGFP - clathrin were described previously [ 34 ] . Cell culture and sample preparation MCF - 7 cells ( obtained from ATCC ) were grown in DMEM ( PAN Biotech , Aidenbach , Ger - many ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS , Life Technologies GmbH , Darm - stadt , Germany ) , 1 % L - glutamine ( PAN Biotech , Aidenbach , Germany ) and 1 % non - essential amino acids ( NEAA , PAN Biotech , Aidenbach , Germany ) at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . For micros - copy experiments cells were seeded in eight - well Lab - Tek chambers ( Nunc , Thermo Fisher Sci - entific , Waltham , USA ) at a density of 3×10 4 cells per well 24 hours before transfection . Cells were transfected with Effectene ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) transfection reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer with a ratio of 1 : 10 ( DNA : effectene ) and a ratio of EGFR plasmid to EGFP - PTB or EGFP - clathrin plasmid of 2 : 1 . 6 - 8 hours after transfection , cells were serum starved ( 0 % FCS ) for 16 – 20 hours . SNAP - EGFR expressing cells were labeled with 500 nM BG - Cy3 for 5 minutes in imaging medium ( DMEM without phenol red , with stable gluta - mine and 25 mM Hepes , PAN Biotech , Aidenbach , Germany ) + 0 . 5 % BSA at 37°C , then washed three times with imaging medium + 0 . 5 % BSA . For dual - color tracking of the receptor , cells were labeled with 250 nM of BG - Cy3 and 250 nM of BG - Alexa488 . Directly before the measurements the medium was removed , cells were washed twice with DPBS + ( DPBS with magnesium and calcium , PAN Biotech , Aidenbach , Germany ) and imaged in DPBS + . To stim - ulate with 16 nM EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) or 16 nM EGF - Alexa488 ( 113 ng / ml ) 10 μ l of a 20× EGF solution was added to cells in 190 μ l DPBS + . For pervanadate stimulation , 8 μ l of a freshly pre - pared 25 mM pervanadate solution ( 25 mM sodium orthovanadate ( Sigma - Aldrich , Tauf - kirchen , Germany ) mixed with 12 . 5 mM H 2 O 2 ( Sigma - Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany ) in ddH 2 O ) was added to cells in 192 μ l DPBS + . For experiments with dynasore ( Calbiochem , Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) , cells were washed twice with DPBS + , 190 μ l of an 80 μ M dynasore solution in DPBS + was added to the cells , and incubated for 30 minutes prior to stim - ulation and imaging . Confocal microscopy Confocal microscopy was done with a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope ( Leica Microsys - tems GmbH , Wetzlar , Germany ) equipped with a 63x oil objective ( HCX PL APO lambda blue 1 . 4NA ) and an incubation chamber at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Dual - color data were acquired by sequential imaging : Channel 1 : ( EGFP / Alexa488 ) excitation with 476 nm , emission 500 – 550 nm . Channel 2 : ( Cy3 ) excitation with 561 nm , emission 575 - 625 nm . EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 3 / 22 Total internal reflection microscopy Single molecule tracking data were acquired with an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) illuminator ( Olympus GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) . Laser illumination was provided by an argon - ion laser ( Innova Sabre DBW 20 , Coherent Inc . , Dieburg , Germany ) emitting at 476 nm , and a krypton - ion laser ( Innova Sabre DBW , Coherent Inc . , Dieburg , Germany ) emitting at 568 nm , each coupled into the TIRF illuminator via a single mode optical fiber . Both lasers were set to emit at an intensity of 100 mW . We estimated that due to losses in the optical setup about 12 % of the illumination power reached the sample . Fluorescence was collected with a PLAPON60xO / TIRFM - SP Objective ( NA = 1 . 45 ) . The emission light was spectrally separated by an Optosplit II image splitter ( Cairn Research , Faversham , UK ) and recorded with an Andor iXon + DU - 897 back - illuminated electron - multiplying CCD camera ( BFIOptilas , Andor , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) . The Optosplit II was equipped with a 570LP dichroic mirror ( DM570 , Olympus GmbH , Ham - burg , Germany ) , with two emission filters : 500 - 550 ( FF01 - 525 / 50 , AHF , Tübingen , Germany ) and 575 - 625 ( BP575 - 625 , Olympus GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ) , and with optics to magnify the image to an effective pixel size of 107 nm . For dual - color imaging the excitation was alter - nated between the 476 nm and 568 nm sources , using custom build electronics to trigger the shutters in synchronization with the EM - CCD camera . The sample was maintained at a con - stant temperature of 37°C using a Bioptechs objective heater ( Chromaphor , Oberhausen , Ger - many ) . For single particle tracking , 300 images were acquired , with an exposure time of 31 . 6 ms , at a rate of 30 frames per second ( fps ) for an effective frame rate of 15 fps per channel . In a single measurement on the average 2×10 3 tracks were collected . Analysis of clathrin fluorescence distribution The distribution of EGFP - clathrin fluorescence was quantified using the Fiji image - processing package [ 35 ] . Background fluorescence was subtracted , the images were segmented , and the resulting spots were counted and quantified by measuring their average size and fluorescence intensity per cell . The spot density was calculated by dividing the spot count by the cell area . Single molecule tracking data analysis and classification A custom MATLAB ( Mathworks , Natick MA ) script was used to separate and align the chan - nels of each frame of a sequence . The shifts between channels were derived from images of Tet - raSpeck fluorescent microsphere standards ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) , which can be imaged with high signal - to - noise ratios . The shifts were determined using the MATLAB ‘ imregtform ’ command , which was able to register the channels with a precision of about 5 nanometers . Cells were selected manually using the Fiji image - processing package [ 35 ] . Single particle tracks were obtained using the u - track package [ 36 ] , and tracks within the selected areas were further analyzed with the vbSPT package [ 37 ] to classify each localization according to a 3 - state model . Simulations based on a 3 - state model , consisting of free , confined and immobile states , confirmed that the vbSPT was able to correctly fit such models . Only tracks with a length of at least 10 localizations were selected for further analysis with MATLAB . Mean - squared - displacement analysis was done as in [ 38 ] , after segmenting the tracks by state . Diffusion coefficients were derived from linear fits to the first 5 points of the MSD curves . The diffusion coefficients calculated by vbSPT do not incorporate corrections for the localization error and were not used . The duration of each state was derived from the mean of the number of particle localizations in each track segment . EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 4 / 22 Single molecule colocalization analysis A particle detected in the second channel was determined to colocalize with a particle acquired in the first channel , if it was found within the area it could explore during acquisition of a single frame . This is equivalent to finding the distance one particle may travel within one frame acquisition . The mean - squared - distance over one acquisition frame is given by [ 38 ] : MSD ¼ 4 s 2 (cid:2) 4 3 D D t (cid:1) (cid:3) þ 4 D D t ; ð 1 Þ where σ is the standard deviation of the localization error , D is the diffusion coef ﬁ cient , and Δ t is the time lag between two frames . The localization error σ can vary per particle , but since this information is not available , we use the estimated average localization error of 20 nm for our system [ 39 ] . We approximated the probability of ﬁ nding the particle at a given distance by a normal distribution with a variance equal to the MSD . A 95 % con ﬁ dence level was then used to ﬁ nd a threshold to determine if two particles in the different channels were colocalizing . Using the diffusion coef ﬁ cients in unstimulated cells , we found for the thresholds in each state : T free = 248 nm , T con ﬁ ned = 172 nm , and T immobile = 122 nm . Colocalization events were retained if par - ticles where colocalizing for at least 5 consecutive frames , indicating that the particles where moving together . The probabilities for detecting a colocalization event were calculated by nor - malizing the number of colocalization events by the number of particles in the given state . In the case of dual - color tracking of SNAP - EGFR labeled with BG - Cy3 and BG - Alexa488 , we applied the tracking and vbSPT analysis to the Cy3 data , and colocalized the Alexa488 - labeled particles , as above . The reason for selecting Cy3 for tracking is that it is more photo - stable than Alexa488 . The average lifetime of the ﬂ uorophores was derived from plots of the total intensi - ties of the frames of a data sequence , which closely followed an exponential distribution . The average lifetime of Cy3 under our imaging conditions was 30 seconds or more , considerably larger than our acquisition time ( 10 s ) , allowing us to neglect photobleaching . However , Alexa488 had an average lifetime ( ~ 13 s ) on the same order as our acquisition time , likely lead - ing to artifacts in the tracking and vbSPT analysis . PTB was fused to EGFP , which is consider - ably less photo - stable than Cy3 . However , because photo - bleaching of EGFP - PTB is independent of the mobility state of the receptor , this affects the colocalization in each state equally . Therefore , we were able to use colocalization with EGFP - PTB as a relative measure of EGFR phosphorylation in the different mobility states . Other endogenous proteins that contain the PTB domain , such as Shc may compete with EGFP - PTB for binding to the receptor . This also will occur equally in each state and does not affect the quanti ﬁ cation of the relative binding probabilities . Spatial distribution analysis To quantify the spatial distribution of confined and free particles in the vicinity of immobile particles , we adapted Ripley ’ s K function [ 40 ] . The standard K function is defined as K ð t Þ ¼ l (cid:2) 1 N X j X j 6¼ i I ð d ij < t Þ ; ð 2 Þ where λ is the density of the points . The sums are over all N points , d ij is the Euclidean distance between the i th and the j th point , and I ( x ) is the indicator function which is equal to one if its operand x is true , or zero otherwise . Upon clustering , a plot of the K function will show a steep increase compared to a plot for randomly distributed points . We modi ﬁ ed this equation to EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 5 / 22 determine if the local density of free or con ﬁ ned particles is higher around immobile points : K free ð t Þ ¼ l (cid:2) 1 free N immobile X N immobile i ¼ 1 X N free j ¼ 1 I ð d ij < t Þ ; ð 3 Þ K confined ð t Þ ¼ l (cid:2) 1 confined N immobile X N immobile i ¼ 1 X N confined j ¼ 1 I ð d ij < t Þ ; ð 4 Þ where λ free and λ con ﬁ ned are the densities of the free and con ﬁ ned points , N immobile is the number of immobile points and N free and N con ﬁ ned are the number of free and con ﬁ ned points . Plots of these functions will have a steep increase compared to a plot for random points , if there is a tendency of the free or con ﬁ ned points to cluster around the immobile points . We calculated K free or K con ﬁ ned for each data set and calculated the mean and standard error of the resulting curves . To calculate the curves , the particle positions from all frames in the acquisition were combined . To evaluate how much the results deviate from random distributions , we randomly redistributed all particles in each data set and calculated the mean and standard errors of K free or K con ﬁ ned . Clathrin colocalization analysis To quantify colocalization between a set of SNAP - EGFR particles and the fluorescence image of EGFP - clathrin we adapted the equation of Manders [ 41 ] , which colocalizes the intensities of a red channel R with a green channel G : M 1 ¼ X i R i ; coloc X i R i ; ð 5 Þ where R i , coloc = G i if G i > 0 . M 1 measures the amount of ﬂ uorescence of the colocalizing objects relative to its total ﬂ uorescence . In our case we count the number of particles where the clathrin signal C is greater than zero . We set R i equal to the number of particles in pixel i to obtain : P ¼ X i R i ; coloc X i R i ¼ N coloc N ; ð 6 Þ where N coloc is the number of particles located in the pixels i where C i > 0 , and N is the total number of particles . However , this measure is highly sensitive to background signals . In addi - tion , the clathrin signal is blurred by diffraction , and a large number of particles will errone - ously be assigned to the colocalizing fraction . Therefore we replaced the requirement C i > 0 by a weighting factor that assigns a higher probability of colocalization to high clathrin intensities : P ¼ X i 2 S R i C i N ; ð 7 Þ where S is the set of pixels that contain on or more localizations . This measure depends on the absolute intensities C i . For randomly distributed particles , we could interpret this equation as randomly drawing N pixels , adding their intensities and dividing by N . Thus , for suf ﬁ ciently large values of N , P = < C > , the average intensity of the image C .

We fused a SNAP - tag [ 42 ] to the extracellular domain of EGFR ( SNAP - EGFR ) and ectopically expressed the receptor in MCF - 7 cells . Before imaging , SNAP - tags that were exposed on the surface of the cell were labeled with the organic fluorophore Cy3 ( Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR ) . Because autophosphorylation is an early step in EGFR signaling , the signal - ing activity of the receptor can be probed by detecting the binding of effectors to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in its C - terminal tail . Therefore , we co - expressed the PTB domain of Shc , which binds to three phosphorylated tyrosine residues ( Tyr1086 , Tyr1114 and Tyr1148 ) in the cytoplasmic tail of EGFR [ 43 , 44 ] , and was tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP - PTB ) . Because it only contains the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc , EGFP - PTB can be used as a probe for EGFR signaling activity with minimal perturbation of the downstream signal . Confocal microscopy confirmed that EGFP - PTB was rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane in ligand - stimulated cells expressing SNAP - EGFR ( S1 Fig ) . We used dual - color total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to specifically image single Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR and EGFP - PTB particles at the basal plasma membrane of the cell , before and after stimulation with EGF ( Fig 1A ) . The fluorescent particles observed in the TIRF field represent either single molecules , or consist of complexes of multiple molecules that diffuse together . To establish how EGF diffuses under the basal plasma membrane of a cell , we imaged Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR together with EGF - Alexa488 ( S2A Fig ) . In the first minute after stimulation , the ligand accumulated at the periphery of the cell , but after two minutes it reached most of the basal plasma membrane , as confirmed by colocalization analysis ( S2B Fig ) . This corroborates an earlier report of slow EGF diffusion under the basal plasma membrane [ 13 ] , and shows that after 2 minutes most receptors are exposed to the ligand . In cells with low expression levels ( S3A Fig ) , the density of receptors in the plasma membrane was sufficiently low ( ~ 0 . 3 particles / μ m 2 , S3B Fig ) to observe the move - ments of individual EGFR particles . In unstimulated cells , the receptor showed a broad range of diffusive behaviors , ranging from fast movement to confinement and immobilization , and the EGFP - PTB signal mostly originated from the cytosol ( S1 Movie and Fig 1B ) . Some plasma - membrane structures were visible that did not correlate to the distribution of Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR , likely due to the binding of EGFP - PTB to phosphorylated proteins other than the receptor . After 10 minutes of stimulation with EGF a slight decrease in receptor mobility was visible and , strik - ingly , EGFP - PTB colocalized clearly with bright immobile spots of Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR ( S1 Movie and Fig 1C ) . EGFP - PTB was also recruited to the plasma membrane at sites where no Cy3 - SNA - P - EGFR was visible . There it likely binds endogenous EGFR , unlabeled SNAP - EGFR , photo - bleached Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR , or other activated receptors that bind the PTB domain of Shc . Nev - ertheless , the striking colocalization of EGFP - PTB with bright immobile spots of Cy3 - SNA - P - EGFR demonstrates signaling activity from aggregated receptors . Ligand binding shifts free EGFR towards the immobile population We proceeded to analyze the mobility and activation of EGFR , up to the time point of 10 min - utes where clear aggregation was observed ( Fig 1C ) .

The latter models particle movements as memory - less jumps between different mobility states , where the number of states is determined by a maximum - evi - dence criterion that balances the goodness of fit with the complexity of the model [ 37 ] . For each cell analyzed , vbSPT yielded at least three states , and therefore we first investigated the properties of a three - state model . We divided the tracks in segments that were classified by mobility state ( Fig 2A , S4 Fig ) and calculated mean squared displacement ( MSD ) curves for Fig 1 .

For many cells vbSPT could also fit four or five states to the data , but MSD analysis showed that this did not introduce different modes of mobility and often led to degenerate mobility states ( S6 Fig ) . Therefore , only three - state models are consistently supported by all data . The results of the EGFR diffusion analysis are represented as state diagrams ( Fig 3A , S7 Fig ) displaying the relative number of particles in each state ( state occupations ) and the probabili - ties of converting between states ( transition probabilities ) . It is important to keep in mind that these diagrams do not represent a closed system at equilibrium : the number of particles can change by fluorophore bleaching , by receptor internalization and recycling , or by assembly or disassembly of aggregates . As a result , the state occupations and the transition probabilities are not trivially related and are not easily interpreted . It should also be noted that the results of vbSPT analysis in a two - dimensional reaction - diffusion system should be interpreted with care [ 3 ] ) . For these reasons we mainly used vbSPT to classify the detected particles in the free , con - fined or immobile states before further analysis . Nevertheless , a number of important conclu - sions can be drawn from these state diagrams : The transitions between states were reversible , and this remained the case after stimulation with EGF , indicating that the receptor was contin - uously switching between different mobility states . To quantify this , we used the classified track segments to calculate the lifetimes of the three mobility states ( Fig 3B ) . The average life - time of each state was remarkably short , approximately half a second in the free state , with a notably longer lifetime of about one second for the immobile state , indicating that after stimu - lation EGFR still alternates between short - lived mobility states . The lifetime of the confined and immobile states increased by ~ 30 % over 10 minutes of EGF stimulation , whereas the life - time of the free state remained stable . Since the transition probabilities did not change appre - ciably after 2 minutes , the increase in state lifetimes of the confined and immobile states is likely the result of aggregation of the receptor . The transition probabilities between the free and immobile states were low compared to the other transition probabilities ( Fig 3A , S7 Fig ) . Therefore , a free particle must pass through an intermediate confined state to reach the immobile state . The most significant changes occurred after two minutes of ligand stimulation , corresponding with the time - scale of EGF binding ( see S2 Fig ) . The occupations of the free and immobile states decreased and increased respectively , while the occupation of the confined state was not affected ( Fig 3C ) . The ratio of the transition probabilities between the free and confined states increased ( Fig 3D ) , showing that ligand bind - ing drives free particles towards the confined state . The transition probabilities between the confined and immobile states were not affected by EGF stimulation , indicating that ligand binding does not directly affect the immobilization of the receptor . We conclude that ligand binding drives activated receptors into a longer - lived confined state , where their movements are likely restricted by the cortical cytoskeleton [ 16 ] . The confined active receptors are subse - quently captured within immobile structures , such as clathrin - coated pits [ 22 , 45 ] . Because of the strong colocalization of EGFP - PTB with bright immobile Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR particles ( S1 Movie and Fig 1C ) , we next investigated the aggregation and signaling activity of EGFR in the immobile state . EGFR forms higher - order clusters in the immobile state The aggregation of EGFR in the different mobility states was investigated by tracking SNA - P - EGFR labeled with equal amounts of Cy3 and Alexa488 ( S3 Movie ) . Aggregation of EGFR was inferred from colocalization between particles in the two channels . Particles in close prox - imity were considered to be colocalizing only when they moved together in the plasma mem - brane ( see Materials and Methods ) , which indicates either a physical interaction or aggregation EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 9 / 22 in the same compartment . We estimated the probability of colocalization by normalizing the number of colocalization events between Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR and Alexa488 - SNAP - EGFR parti - cles with the number of detected Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR particles in each state ( Fig 4A ) .

After stimulation with EGF the receptor aggregated , mostly in the confined and immobile states . The probability of receptor colocalization was higher in the immobile state compared to the free and confined states , either owing to a larger fraction of dimers in the immobile state , or due to the presence of higher order clusters . To differentiate between these two possibilities we inspected the fluorescence intensity histograms of Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR in the different states ( Fig 4B ) . The histograms of immobile particles were shifted and skewed towards higher intensities compared to the histograms of free and confined particles , confirming a higher degree of aggregation ( Fig 4B , solid lines ; sample mean values : μ free = 1137 , μ confined = 1162 , μ immobile = 1530 ; sample skewness values : s free = 1 . 4 , s confined = 1 . 4 , s immobile = 2 . 1 ) . We also plotted intensity histograms after selecting for Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR particles that colocalized with Alexa488 - SNAP - EGFR , which represent the fluorescence intensities from dimers or higher order clusters ( Fig 4B , dashed lines ) . The intensity histogram of the immobile colocalized parti - cles was clearly shifted and skewed compared to the intensity histograms of the colocalized free and confined particles , indicating the presence of clusters of immobile particles consisting of three or more receptors ( sample mean values : μ free = 1423 , μ confined = 1474 , μ immobile = 2282 ; sample skewness values : s free = 1 . 2 , s confined = 1 . 3 , s immobile = 1 . 6 ) . Activation of EGFR by inhibi - tion of protein tyrosine phosphatases with pervanadate was slower , requiring us to measure time - points up to 30 minutes , but showed similar results , showing that aggregation of the receptor did not require ligand binding ( S8 Fig ) . EGFR phosphorylation is amplified in the immobile state We then investigated the signaling activity of EGFR by detecting the colocalization of EGFP - PTB particles with Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR ( Fig 5A ) . In this case , the colocalization probability can be interpreted as a measure of signaling activity , because it represents the likelihood that the C - terminal tyrosine residues in an EGFR particle are phosphorylated . After ligand binding , the immobile EGFR particles showed a significantly higher probability of PTB binding compared to the confined receptors , indicating that they had a higher signaling activity . Fluorescence intensity histograms of the whole population of Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR and of particles that coloca - lized with EGFP - PTB showed that the phosphorylated receptors were brighter in the immobile state , indicating a higher degree of aggregation of the phosphorylated sub - population ( Fig 5B ) . Bright phosphorylated particles were also observed after inhibition of protein tyrosine phos - phatases with pervanadate , demonstrating that aggregation of phosphorylated EGFR was inde - pendent of ligand binding ( S9 Fig ) . The immobile particles have a higher signaling activity compared to free and confined states , because they represent clusters of multiple receptors ( see also Fig 4 ) . Indeed , after 10 minutes of stimulation , the PTB colocalization probability in the immobile state was twice that of the confined state ( Fig 5A ) . However , the difference between the probabilities of EGFR aggregation in the immobile and confined states was less pronounced ( Fig 4A ) . This suggested that immobile EGFR was phosphorylated to a higher degree than expected from its level of aggregation . To investigate this , we determined the relation between EGF binding and the phosphorylation of the receptor . We imaged Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR after stimulation with EGF - A - lexa488 ( S4 Movie ) and quantified EGF binding by estimating the probability that an EGF particle colocalized with an EGFR particle ( Fig 5C ) . EGF mostly bound to receptors in the con - fined and immobile states , with the highest colocalization probability in the immobile state , due to the availability of multiple binding sites in the immobile particles . EGF binding did not change significantly after two minutes , indicating that ligand binding is not a rate - limiting step in the phosphorylation reaction . Also here , the difference in PTB binding between the EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 11 / 22 immobile and confined states of EGFR was relatively large when compared to the difference in EGF binding ( compare Fig 5A – 5C ) , indicating that the phosphorylation of the receptor was not proportional to the ligand occupancy . To quantify this observation , we calculated in each cell the fold - increase of the colocalization probability of EGF or PTB in the immobile state compared to the confined state ( Fig 5D ) . In the immobile state the colocalization probability of EGF binding was ~ 50 % higher compared to the confined state , whereas the colocalization probability of PTB was 100 % more . Immobile EGFR particles are therefore more efficiently binding effectors at their C - terminal tyrosine residues , relative to the extent of ligand binding , as compared to the confined receptors . Thus , the higher level of PTB binding in the immobile state compared to the confined state cannot be explained by a higher number of ligand - bound receptors in immobile particles , which points to an amplification of phosphorylation in recep - tor clusters . Activation of EGFR is supported by clustering in clathrin - coated pits Activated EGFR is recruited to clathrin - coated pits [ 45 ] where it forms clusters of up to 5 EGFR molecules [ 22 ] . Therefore we investigated if amplification of EGFR phosphorylation requires receptor clustering in clathrin - coated pits . We tracked the receptor while simulta - neously imaging EGFP - tagged human clathrin light chain A ( EGFP - clathrin , Fig 6A and S5 Movie ) . To quantify the colocalization of the EGFR particles with the EGFP - clathrin signal , we modified an existing approach for measuring the overlap of two images [ 41 ] . After EGF Fig 5 .

Autonomous activation of the receptor by inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases with pervanadate also led to an increase in colocalization , showing that phos - phorylation of the receptor was responsible for the recruitment of EGFR to clathrin - coated pits Fig 6 . Recruitment to clathrin - coated pits is required for robust EGFR activation .

Note that not all immobile particles appeared to colocalize with EGFP - clathrin ( Fig 6A ) , suggesting that other independent mechanisms could also operate to immobilize EGFR . To further investigate if the amplification of the phosphorylation of EGFR occurs in the cla - thrin - coated pits , we interfered acutely with the development of clathrin - coated pits using dynasore , a small molecule inhibitor of dynamin [ 46 ] . Dynasore inhibits separation of cla - thrin - coated pits from the plasma membrane and arrests them at early growth phases [ 46 ] because their maturation is controlled by regulatory checkpoints that depend on dynamin - 2 [ 47 ] . After incubation with dynasore , the colocalization of immobile SNAP - EGFR particles with EGFP - clathrin was impaired ( Fig 6C , compare with Fig 6B ) . Since the number and size of the clathrin - coated pits were unchanged ( S11 Fig ) , we concluded that this was the result of arresting the clathrin - coated pits in a non - functional state . We then measured the phosphory - lation of EGFR particles after incubation with dynasore and found that the response was delayed ( Fig 6D , compare with Fig 5A ) . We conclude that EGFR is not efficiently retained in clathrin - coated pits after interfering with their maturation , and as a result the amplification of the phosphorylation of EGFR is reduced , leading to a delay in the overall response to ligand . To influence the localization of EGFR without chemically perturbing the clathrin - coated pits , we used a mutant of EGFR ( Y1045F ) that does not bind directly to the E3 ubiquitin - ligase c - Cbl [ 48 ] . Recruitment of EGFR to clathrin - coated pits is partially regulated via ubiquitination by c - Cbl [ 49 ] . Therefore , we expected the localization of this mutant to clathrin - coated pits to be reduced , thereby affecting the amplification of its phosphorylation . Indeed , we found that the response of this mutant to EGF stimulation , both in terms of its colocalization with EGFP - clathrin and of its phosphorylation , was reduced compared to the wild - type receptor ( Fig 6E and 6F compare with Figs 5A and 6B ) . The mutated receptor did not reach the same level of activity as wild - type EGFR after 10 minutes of stimulation , and clustered substantially less in the immobile state ( S12 Fig compare with Fig 5B ) . EGFR clusters in clathrin - coated pits are sources of signaling activity Because clathrin - coated pits are well - defined immobile structures with a lifetime of approxi - mately one minute [ 50 ] , we asked if amplification of EGFR phosphorylation could affect the signaling activity of the receptor in the surrounding plasma membrane . After ligand stimula - tion , the state lifetimes of Cy3 - SNAP - EGFR particles that colocalized with EGFP - PTB were on a seconds time - scale ( Fig 7A , compare with Fig 3B ) , indicating that phosphorylated particles still alternated rapidly between the different mobility states . This indicated that phosphorylated receptors in immobile aggregates were able to escape to the free and confined state . As a result of the amplification of phosphorylation in immobile EGFR particles , gradients in the signaling activity of confined and free receptors could be established [ 51 ] . In this case , the immobile EGFR particles represent sources where receptors are phosphorylated , while dephosphoryla - tion can occur anywhere in the plasma membrane ( including the clathrin - coated pits ) . To test for the presence of such gradients , we employed a variation of Ripley ’ s K function , a descriptive statistic that is commonly used for detecting deviations from spatial homogeneity [ 40 ] . It quan - tifies the average particle density in a local area around each point in a spatial pattern as a func - tion of the area size . We adapted Ripley ’ s K function to quantify the local density of free or confined particles around immobile particles . After stimulation , the concentration of confined phosphorylated receptors was significantly increased around immobile EGFR particles , com - pared to the distribution of all particles in unstimulated cells ( Fig 7B ) . For free particles a simi - lar trend was observed , but the differences were not statistically significant ( S13 Fig ) , either because relatively few particles are phosphorylated in the free state ( Fig 5A ) thereby increasing the measurement error , or because the faster diffusion of free particles leads to shallower EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 14 / 22 gradients [ 51 ] that are more difficult to detect . Note that Ripley ’ s K function can be used to detect a non - random distribution , but is not suitable for inferring its properties without further knowledge . In this particular case , it demonstrates that the concentration of phosphorylated receptors is higher around the immobile particles , thereby demonstrating the existence of a gradient of phosphorylation . It does not give us further quantitative information , such as the extent of the gradient . However , the existence of these gradients shows that the observed ampli - fication of PTB binding ( Fig 5 ) did not just reflect an increase in effector binding efficiency , but is due to cross - phosphorylation between EGFR . The existence of phosphorylation gradients for confined receptors also shows that cross - phosphorylation in receptor clusters leads to gradients of signaling activity that localize the EGFR signal around clathrin - coated pits . Discussion We employed single particle tracking to quantify the mobility , aggregation and signaling activ - ity of EGFR at the plasma membrane , and found that its phosphorylation is amplified by recep - tor clustering in clathrin - coated pits . We propose that this contributes to a rapid and robust response , which establishes a new role for clathrin - coated pits in the early phases of EGFR sig - naling at the plasma membrane , adding to their well - established role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which propagates , and eventually terminates , the signal in the interior of the cell ( Fig 8 ) . Our work introduces a novel method for quantifying the signaling activity of EGFR at a sin - gle molecule level by detecting the binding of a genetically engineered probe to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the cytosolic tail of the receptor . In the present work we focused on the sig - naling activity of immobile EGFR in clathrin - coated pits , but our experimental approach is well suited to investigate other questions such as the role of the cytoskeleton in the signaling activity of EGFR . Moreover , this method is generic as it could easily be adapted for use with dif - ferent receptors , by using a binding domain derived from an appropriate effector . Our work is in agreement with earlier reports that use single molecule tracking to investigate the mobility of EGFR upon activation by ligand [ 15 , 16 ] . We also find that upon stimulation with ligand the mobility of the receptor decreases markedly . In particular , we find a population Fig 7 .

[ 16 ] , who showed that co - confinement of the receptor by the cytoskeleton enhances dimer formation . Earlier single molecule work did not focus on the role of immobile receptors , although Chung et al . [ 15 ] reported a very slow state , which they hypothesized to be active receptors that started to interact with cytosolic proteins involved in signaling and endocytosis . Our work extends these reports by investigating the clustering and signaling activity of the receptor in the immo - bile state . Clustering of EGFR has been described by several authors [ 17 – 21 , 23 ] , and was reported to occur in clathrin - coated pits [ 22 ] . However , these reports did not provide a clear mechanism for cluster formation and did not clarify the functional role of these clusters . There have been no structural studies that account for EGFR clustering by direct interactions between the recep - tors . Phosphorylation on the regulatory tyrosine residue Tyr845 has been shown to increase the dimerization affinity of EGFR [ 25 ] , but there is no evidence that this also supports higher order clustering . Our results indicate that the clustering of phosphorylated EGFR in clathrin - coated pits is predominantly dictated by effector binding . Activated EGFR binds to the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 [ 45 , 52 , 53 ] , providing potential binding sites in the clathrin - coated pits . The E3 ubiquitin - ligase c - Cbl is recruited to the receptor , either by binding directly at the phosphory - lated tyrosine residue Tyr1045 [ 48 ] , or indirectly via Grb2 which binds to the phosphorylated Tyr1068 and Tyr1086 residues [ 54 , 55 ] . EGFR ubiquitination is recognized by several proteins in the clathrin - coated pits , such as the AP - 2 interacting proteins epsin1 and Eps15 [ 56 , 57 ] . Our experiments with the Y1045F mutant of EGFR , which does not bind c - Cbl directly , show that clustering of phosphorylated EGFR is caused by the aggregation of the ubiquitinated receptor in clathrin - coated pits . As a consequence , the number of molecules in an EGFR cluster depends on the number of available binding sites in a clathrin - coated pit , which can vary substantially [ 50 ] . This might explain the lack of a clear consensus on the size of EGFR clusters in the literature . Fig 8 . A new role for clathrin - coated pits in the early phases of EGFR signaling . Upon stimulation with ligand , epidermal growth - factor receptors are recruited to clathrin - coated pits , where their phosphorylation is amplified by clustering . Phosphorylated receptors are able to escape the clathrin - coated pits leading to an amplified EGFR signal in surrounding plasma membrane . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 . g008 EGFR Activation in Clathrin - Coated Pits PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143162 November 17 , 2015 16 / 22 Earlier work has shown that the signaling activity of EGFR is potentiated in endosomes , as judged by a high stoichiometry of Grb2 binding to EGFR [ 58 ] . This is consistent with our find - ings that EGFR phosphorylation is amplified in clathrin - coated pits , which could result in an increased signaling activity of EGFR in the endocytic pathway . Our results demonstrate that EGFR signaling activity is already amplified at the initial step of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . The amplification of EGFR phosphorylation by clustering in clathrin - coated pits is likely important at low - expression levels where the encounter rate of receptors in the plasma mem - brane is low . Amplification of phosphorylation could also establish a positive feedback loop between EGFR aggregation and signal amplification because the recruitment of receptors to clathrin - coated pits depends on the phosphorylation of EGFR . We find that EGFR binds tran - siently to clathrin - coated pits , which is in agreement with a recent report that the interactions of clathrin - coated pits with other cargo can be highly transient [ 50 ] . As a result , phosphory - lated receptors are able to escape to the plasma membrane . Because receptor phosphorylation is amplified in clathrin - coated pits , this leads to the formation of local gradients of signaling active receptors . This could enhance signaling from EGFR in the vicinity of clathrin - coated pits and spatially limit the response to a local stimulus . Paradoxically , these gradients could at the same time contribute to a more efficient termination of the overall EGFR signal by increas - ing the probability of internalizing phosphorylated receptors . Thus , the amplification of recep - tor phosphorylation in clathrin - coated pits establishes local gradients of signaling activity at the plasma membrane that could spatially and temporally constrain the EGFR signal . Our data do not exclude the possibility that EGFR is also immobilized in other membrane domains apart from clathrin - coated pits . Localization to membrane rafts or confinement by the cytoskeleton could provide the same benefit of locally concentrating the receptor , and pos - sibly enable amplification of receptor phosphorylation . The presented tools for quantifying the signaling activity of EGFR at a single molecule level should be well suited to investigate these possibilities . Our results highlight the multi - layered nature of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern EGFR signal activation . Various structural features control receptor dimerization upon ligand binding , which is the key initial event that activates EGFR signaling . In addition , extrinsic mechanisms that involve intracellular factors such as tyrosine kinase phosphatases suppress autocatalytic activity , while complementary amplification mechanisms , for instance based on local phosphatase inhibition , support a stable signal upon ligand binding . Our work identifies receptor clustering in clathrin - coated pits as an additional amplification mechanism that supports activation of the EGFR signal after ligand stimulation .
