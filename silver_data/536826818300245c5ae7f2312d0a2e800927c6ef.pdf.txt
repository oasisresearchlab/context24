Introduction A recent CDC Commentary states there is “little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to transmission” [ 1 ] , based on reports of similar infection rates in schools compared to the surrounding community [ 2 , 3 ] and the relative infrequency of documented school - based outbreaks [ 2 – 7 ] . However , infection rates in schools have been estimated primarily from testing of symptomatic students rather than proactive testing of asymptomatic students , which can lead to underestimation of the total attack rate since asymptomatic spread accounts for ~ 60 % of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission [ 8 ] , the majority of transmission comes from a minority of cases ( overdispersion ) [ 9 ] , and children are more likely to experience asymptomatic infections than adults [ 10 ] . Here , we use mathematical models incorporating these transmission characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 to determine whether the ratio of infection rates in children versus adults coupled with the lack of detected in - school outbreaks is sufficient to rule out the possibility that schools are amplifying COVID - 19 transmission . The Study First , we assessed whether transmission risks in schools can be inferred based on the ratio of SARS - CoV - 2 attack rates among school children versus the surrounding community . We use a Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered ( SEIR ) compartmental model of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission with age - specific contact rates [ 11 ] and location - specific transmission probabilities ( Technical Appendix , Figure S1 ) . The model assumes that all symptomatic infections are detected , with children having a lower probability of symptom presentation ( 21 % ) than adults ( 70 % ) [ 10 ] . We simulated two scenarios , one in which schools amplify transmission ( high risk ) .

The low risk scenario assumes a population - wide reproduction number of R 0 = 1 . 1 ; the high risk scenario sets the transmission risk among children to correspond to an elevated in - school reproduction number of R 0 = 2 . 5 ( see Technical Appendix for details ) . Under the high risk scenario , our model predicts a high SARS - CoV - 2 attack rate among both school children and adults in the surrounding community , with school children having a higher infection rate ( Figure 1A ) but similar case detection rate ( Figure 1B ) compared to adults . Because children are much more likely to experience asymptomatic infections that go undetected [ 10 ] , resulting in much lower reported to true case rates in children than adults [ 12 ] , the ratio of reported cases in children versus adults is expected to drop well below one , even when the true incidence is much higher in children ( Figure 1C ) . For comparison , a recent study in Wood County , Wisconsin [ 2 ] found that the ratio of reported cases among children attending in - person school versus all other members of the community was 0 . 57 ( 2 , 728 per 100 , 000 in children vs 4 , 785 in adults ) by the 13th week of the school year ( Figure 1C , horizontal line ) . By the 13th week of the simulation , the observed proportion is equally if not more consistent with the high risk scenario , suggesting that a low ratio of infection rates in school versus the community does not exclude the possibility that schools amplify community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 10 ] . Second , we estimated the likelihood of detecting outbreaks that occur in schools via symptom - gated forward contact tracing , which has been commonly used by schools in the US [ 2 ] . Detecting child - to - child transmission using this approach relies on the appearance and reporting of two consecutive symptomatic cases , connected by a transmission event . If we assume that only symptomatic cases are detected , that 21 % of pediatric COVID - 19 infections are symptomatic [ 10 ] , and that asymptomatic and symptomatic infections are equally infectious [ 13 ] , .

Wood County [ 2 ] identified seven in - school transmission events via symptom - gated forward contact tracing , suggesting that there may have been over 150 child - to - child infections in the same time period . Using a Markov model of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission that accounts for overdispersion in secondary cases [ 9 ] ( Figure 2A , Technical Appendix , Figure S2 ) , we estimate the chance that a detected symptomatic case will infect at least one child who also develops symptoms . As a result of overdispersion , most of these index cases are not expected to transmit to others [ 9 ] ; of those that do , only a small fraction of the resulting secondary cases will be symptomatic [ 10 ] . Assuming a negative binomial distribution of secondary cases with mean ( R 0 ) of 2 . 5 and an overdispersion parameter k of 0 . 1 [ 9 ] ( corresponding to the high risk in - school transmission scenario ) , we expect that only 28 % of index cases would infect at least one child and only 16 . 5 % [ 11 . 5 % - 22 . 0 % ] would infect at least one child that goes on to develop symptoms ( Figure 2B ) . Given the difficulty of ascertaining child - to - child SARS - CoV - 2 infections via symptom - gated forward contact tracing , low numbers of documented events do not necessarily indicate a lack of in - school transmission . Our estimates optimistically assume that all symptomatic cases are reported and all transmission events between successive symptomatic cases are detected . However , recent contact - tracing studies in the United States suggest that many named contacts are not successfully traced [ 14 , 15 ] and not all symptomatic contacts are willing to undergo testing [ 7 ] , both of which would further undermine the detection of cases and transmission events in schools . On the other hand , we assume that only symptomatic infections are detected . Our findings do not pertain to schools that have established proactive ( asymptomatic ) surveillance testing programs [ 12 , 16 ] and contact - tracing programs that offer testing to all contacts , regardless of symptom .

Of note , in the case where an accurate picture of the true infection rates is possible , we found that as contacts between children and adults increased , total infection rates in the population rose , while the gap between infection rates in children and adults narrowed ( Figure S3 ) . As a final caveat , our model does not explicitly account for adults working in schools or children who are not in school ; both of these groups would be expected to have infection risks associated with their environment , but symptomatic rates associated with their age group . Conclusions In this work , we examined whether the absence of evidence of in - school transmission could be taken as evidence of absence . We simulated a scenario in which schools have a higher rate of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission than the surrounding community and compared it to a scenario where the rate of transmission was similar between schools and the community . We found that the ratio of cases occurring in and out of schools and low numbers of documented in - school transmission events are not sufficient to distinguish these two scenarios . While there are compelling arguments for returning to in - person learning , particularly as SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine coverage increases , a robust understanding of the limitations of the metrics being used to assess SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is critical for risk management . .

The projections assume a population - wide reproduction number of R 0 = 1 . 1 in the low risk scenario and elevated in - school reproduction number of R 0 = 2 . 5 in the high risk scenario , that children and adults have distinct symptomatic proportions [ 10 ] , and that all symptomatic infections are detected . Figure 2 . Detecting in - school transmission by symptom - gated forward contact tracing . A . Schematic illustration of a SARS - CoV - 2 transmission tree demonstrating the impact of overdispersion and asymptomatic infections on the effectiveness of symptom - gated forward contact tracing . In this example , only 6 out of 17 infections and 1 out of 16 transmission events are detected . B . We estimate the percent of symptomatic index cases expected to have one or more detected secondary infections , under three different levels of overdispersion in the distribution of secondary infections , corresponding to the estimated median ( k = 0 . 1 ) and 95 % CI ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 2 ) for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 9 ] . As the dispersion factor ( k ) increases , the proportion of cases that cause at least one secondary infection also increases and the likelihood of detecting transmission events becomes more sensitive to the underlying symptomatic proportion . Dashed lines indicate estimated symptomatic proportions for children ( 21 % ) and adults ( 70 % ) [ 10 ] . Model simulations are based on 200 index cases and 1 , 000 repeated simulations . ng e tic of .
