Ward 2 Supplemental Methods Electron microscopy ( EM ) For negative stain preparation , the VLP samples were diluted with PBS pH 7 . 4 – 100 µg / mL based on estimated influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) content . 5 µL of the diluted VLP solution was placed for 45 sec on 200 Hex grids ( EMS Inc . , Hatfield , PA ) , formerly carbon coated and glow - discharged . The grids were washed twice with 5µL of distilled water for 45 sec followed by 45 sec incubation with 2 % uranyl acetate ( EMS Inc . ) . Excess fluid was removed by blotting with a filter paper and samples were left to air dry . The grids were imaged commonly on a Tecnai T12 ( FEI Inc . , Hillsboro , OR ) . The MDM samples processing for EM is described in the manuscript , Methods section . Endocytosis inhibitors screening A number of endocytosis inhibitors were screened based on their effect on virus - like particles ( VLPs ) internalization measured by 1 , 1 ' - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 ' , 3 ' - tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiD - Thermo Fisher Scientific , Eugene , OR ) fluorescence dequenching upon VLP fusion with cell membranes . H1 - VLPs ( influenza HA based on the sequence of A / California / 07 / 2009 H1N1 virus , Medicago Inc . , Quebec , QC ) were labelled with DiD ( see Methods section of the manuscript ) . B10R cell culture ( an immortalized murine bone marrow - derived macrophage cell line ) was maintained in RPMI - 1640 with 50 IU / mL penicillin , 50 µg / mL streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES ( medium ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , all from Wisent , Saint - Jean - Baptiste , QC ) until reaching cell confluency . B10R cells were detached from plastic flask surface using 0 . 25 % trypsin / 2 . 21 mM EDTA in HBSS ( Wisent ) and plated on 96 - well Nunclon Delta black flat - bottom plates ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Roskilde , Denmark ) at 5 x 10 4 cells per well . The following day , B10R cells in 3 triplicate wells were exposed to DiD - labelled VLPs in the medium ( HA concentration 15 . 0 µg / mL ) ; plates were kept at 4°C for one hour and then washed with ice - cold medium twice . Endocytosis inhibitors were applied in ice - cold medium supplemented with 10 % FBS ( 100 µL / well ) : dynasore hydrate ( 50 µM ) , chlorpromazine hydrochloride ( 10 µg / mL ) , sucrose ( 0 . 45 M ) , pitstop 2 ( 25 µM ) , genistein ( 200 µM ) , filipin III from Streptomyces filipinensis ( 5 µg / mL ) , amiloride hydrochloride ( 1 mM ) , cytochalasin D ( 4 µM ) ( all from Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Pitstop 2 was also tested at the same concentration in serum - free medium . The plates were placed into a pre - heated ( 37°C ) spectrophotometer ( Infinite 200 PRO , Tecan , Männedorf , Switzerland ) , and DiD fluorescence was measured at 15 - min intervals over 2 h . Fusion efficiency ( % ) was determined following addition of Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to each well ( final concentration 1 % ) to obtain full DiD dequenching . Toxicity assessment of endocytosis inhibitors B10R cell culture was maintained in the medium supplemented with 10 % FBS until reaching cell confluency . B10R cells were detached from plastic flask surface using 0 . 25 % trypsin / 2 . 21 mM EDTA in HBSS and plated on 96 - well Nunclon Delta black flat - bottom plates at 5 x 10 4 cells per well . The following day , endocytosis inhibitors ( see the endocytosis inhibitors screening section and the Supplemental Table 1 ) in the medium supplemented with 10 % FBS were applied to B10R cells in triplicate wells in a volume 100 µL / well ( 5 % CO 2 , 37°C for 2 h ) . Chlorpromazine hydrochloride was applied at concentrations 10 and 100 µg / mL . Pitstop 2 was also tested in serum - free medium . Triton X - 100 0 . 01 % solution served as a positive control . The effects of endocytosis inhibitors on B10R cells viability were evaluated in parallel experiments with the CytoTox - ONE™ homogeneous membrane integrity assay and the CellTiter - Glo ® 2 . 0 assay ( both from Promega , Madison , WI ) . Cell membrane integrity was assessed by lactate 4 dehydrogenase ( LDH ) release . CytoTox - ONE™ reagent ( 100 µL / well ) was applied for 10 min at RT . Stop solution ( 50µl ) was then added to each well , and the fluorescence was measured on Infinite 200 PRO spectrophotometer at excitation and emission wavelengths 560 and 600 nm , respectively . The results were reported as a % of the maximum LDH release caused by adding lysis solution to the control wells . The effects of endocytosis inhibitors on metabolically active cells were quantitated by the amount of ATP with CellTiter - Glo ® luminescent cell viability assay . CellTiter - Glo ® 2 . 0 reagent ( 100 µl / well ) was applied for 10 min at RT . Luciferase luminescence was measured on Infinite 200 PRO spectrophotometer . The results were reported as a % of ATP level reduction compared to control wells unexposed to any endocytosis inhibitor . Conventional image analysis Confocal microscopy images were analyzed with ImageJ software 1 for the purpose of evaluation the fluorescence intensity of immunolabelled HA or fluorophore - conjugated transferrin , or for the assessment of colocalization of HA with endosomal markers Rab5 , Rab7 and Rab11 . 2 In brief , to analyze the HA or transferrin fluorescence intensity per cell area we identified cellular boundaries on the brightfield channel , and used them to establish the regions of interest ( ROIs ) on the fluorescent channel ( s ) . Then we determined the background fluorescence intensity in each experiment by averaging the values obtained from cells in the control sample ( for HA : monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDMs ) unexposed to HA but stained with anti - HA primary and fluorescent secondary antibody ; for transferrin : MDMs unexposed to transferrin ) . The average background fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the fluorescence values measured from HA or transferrin - exposed cells . For “cell - based” colocalization analysis , both “green” and “red” channels were denoised with ImageJ PureDenoise plugin , 3 then image background was subtracted with the “rolling ball” algorithm . 4 5 HA colocalization with endosomal markers was determined within cell boundaries - defined ROIs ( see above ) using Colocalization Threshold plugin ; 5 Costes thresholding approach was applied . 6 Pearson correlation coefficient R , Pearson coefficient for pixels whose intensity falls above a threshold value R ( > t ) , and Manders above threshold colocalization coefficients tM1 and tM2 were analyzed . 2 , 7 , 8 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 . 0 software . One - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey ' s multiple comparisons post - test , two - way ANOVA followed by Tukey ' s multiple comparisons post - test or Mann - Whitney test were used to examine the differences between samples . P values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . 6 Supplemental tables Supplemental Table 1 Endocytosis inhibitors used in screening experiments and their suggested mechanism of action Inhibitor of endocytosis Tested concentration / condition Suggested mechanism of action Toxicity Dynamin - dependent endocytosis Dynasore 50 µM Non - competitive and reversible inhibitor of GTPase activity of dynamin . 9 Dynasore suppresses both CME and CIE . 10 , 11 Non - toxic Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) Chlorpromazine 10 – 100 µg / mL Not well understood . It has been suggested that chlorpromazine causes AP - 2 and clathrin relocation from plasma membrane to endosomal membranes and therefore depletes AP - 2 and clathrin from the plasma membrane and prevents clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles formation . 12 Chlorpromazine probably affects dynamin activity . 13 Non - toxic at 10 µg / mL . Toxicity observed at higher concentrations Hyperosmotic sucrose 0 . 45 M Not well understood . It has been suggested that hyperosmolarity leads to trapping clathrin in “microcages” and depleting it from plasma membrane . 14 Greatly reduced ATP level in cells Pitstop 2 25 µM ( applied in serum - free or 10 % FBS supplemented medium ) Not well understood . Pitstop 2 was developed as cell - permeable selective CME inhibitor . 15 However , later pitstop 2 has been shown to potently inhibit CIE . 16 , 17 Toxic in serum - free medium ( recommended use due to sequestering by serum albumins ) Clathrin - Independent Endocytosis Genistein 200 µM Tyrosine - kinase inhibitor . 18 Phosphorylation of tyrosine at caveolin - 1 is the prerequisite for pinching off caveolar vesicles from plasma membrane . 19 Non - toxic Filipin III 5 µg / mL Cholesterol depleting and lipid - raft disrupting agent . 20 Moderate cytotoxicity and 7 massive ATP level reduction . Macropinocytosis Amiloride 1 mM Inhibition of Na + / H + exchange leads to lowering submembranous pH and preventing Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling that is essential for actin remodeling . 21 Non - toxic

Gel Electrophoresis , Immunoblot and EM characterization of plant - derived H1 - VLPs and soluble recombinant H1 ( comparator ) . ( a - c ) Full , un - cropped images of SDS - PAGE with Coomassi blue staining and immunoblots , ( legend continued on next page ) 16 including full molecular weight markers . ( a ) Two representative examples of SDS - PAGE gels stained with Coomassie blue . The H1 - VLPs and soluble recombinant H1 ( comparator ) were applied at 2 . 5 and 5 . 0 µg per sample ( by HA content ) . The predominant protein observed in both samples corresponded to the molecular weight of monomeric H1 ( ~ 75 kDa ) . No additional bands suggesting HA cleavage or degradation products were found in the soluble H1 sample ( comparator ) . The H1 - VLPs sample had a small number of less prominent bands at ~ 160 kDa ( probably HA dimers ) and at ~ 55 kDa ( probably HA1 subunit ) . Immunoblot images of H1 - VLPs and soluble H1 ( both applied at 0 . 5 µg per sample by HA content ) with polyclonal ( b ) or monoclonal ( c ) anti - H1 antibodies . In both cases , images were acquired using the ChemiDoc™ XRS + System ( ChemiDoc ) with molecular weight markers ( left ) or immunostained for H1 ( middle ) . X - ray images of the same membranes are also presented ( right ) . The predominant protein observed in both samples was again monomeric H1 ( ~ 75 kDa ) with no additional bands suggesting HA cleavage or degradation products in the soluble H1 sample ( comparator ) . For the VLP sample , a small number of fainter bands were seen on both immunoblots as well as the X - ray images : ~ 160 kDa ( HA dimers ) and ~ 55 kDa ( HA1 subunit ) . On some blots immunostained with the monoclonal anti - H1 , faint bands were present at ~ 240 kDa ( likely HA trimmers ) and at 30 kDA ( HA2 subunit ) . The low evident band at ~ 105 kDa probably represents the uncleaved H1 - HA2 subunit complexes . ( d ) Negative stain EM of H1 - VLP sample . Representative image shows pleomorphic particles ~ 100 nm average diameter with spikes on their surface . Scale bar – 100 nm .
