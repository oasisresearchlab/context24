For systems involving users , user - centric design approaches are more appropriate . The ideation stage of design involves exploring the space of opportunities . One commonly held view in design disciplines is that quantity leads to quality . Yet , for related non - design disciplines such as engineering , quantity is often regarded as a negative characteristic associated with low quality . Focusing on quality alone may lead to inferior user experience and ineffective systems . This study describes an initiative to ( 1 ) collect empirical evidence to support the design - belief that quantity leads to quality and ( 2 ) to use the activity and its results as part of a pedagogical strategy to enhance students’ awareness of the connections between quantity and quality during ideation . A class of 100 computer science students was divided into two groups . Both groups were given the same task to design a text - input strategy for individuals with motor disabilities but with different focuses : one group was asked to focus on quality of ideas and the other group on the quantity of ideas . The results show that the students who focused on quantity of ideas produced better quality concepts compared to the students that focused on quality . The results were presented to and discussed with the students as a part of the learning process .

I NTRODUCTION Systems targeted at end users engineered with traditional methods are unlikely to achieve full usability and user satisfaction . Still , many such systems are made by engineers using traditional methods . A complex device or instrument will fail in the marketplace if it is not usable by the customers . E - learning tools such as simulators and online experimentation will not lead to the desired learning effects if they are not engaging the students . One reason for this situation is that design thinking is typically not taught in engineering programs , and teachers of engineering courses are rarely trained in design thinking . This study focuses on one aspect of design thinking , namely the achievement of quality through quantity . In most domains , quality is often viewed as the opposite of quantity in that quantity leads to poorer quality while quality is achieved through focus and low quantity ( see , for instance , Becker and Lewis [ 1 ] and Motta [ 2 ] ) . It is thus a curious fact that designers often argue differently that quantity is needed to achieve quality . During ideation it is necessary to explore as much as possible of the design space thereby considering many poor ideas in order to discover the really good ideas . The claim that quantity is needed for quality thereby challenges the widely believed myth that quantity leads to poor quality . However , for someone with a basic understanding of design thinking the notion of quantity leading to quality is both intuitive and logical . Yet , we have been unable to identify any empirical evidence for this claim . The only exception being Keller and Staelin’s study of the impact of information quality and information quantity for consumer decisions [ 3 ] . Other somewhat related studies include Shah , Smith and Vargas - Hernandez’s [ 4 ] assessment of four metrics for measuring ideation , i . e . , quantity , quality , novelty and variety , with the goal of assessing the effectiveness of different ideation techniques . Chan , Dow and Schunn [ 5 ] explored the claim that conceptually distant sources of inspiration is the most valuable for design processes . Their results supported the view that conceptual distance is not important . This study is inspired by a text in the book entitled Art and Fear by Bayles and Orland [ 6 ] who gives the following account of an “experiment” to demonstrate that quantity leads to quality : “ The ceramics teacher accounted on opening day that he was dividing the class into groups . All those on the left side of the studio , he said , would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced , all those on the right solely on its quality . His procedure was simple : on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group : fifty pounds of pots rated an “A” , forty pounds a “B” and so on . Those being graded on “quality” , however , needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A” . Well , came grading time and a curious fact emerged : the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity . It seems that while the “qua ntity ” group was busily churni ng out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the 2019 5th Experiment @ International Conference ( exp . at’19 ) June 12th – 14th , 2019 , University of Madeira , Funchal , Madeira , Portugal 172 “ quality ” group had sat theorizing about perfection , and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay . ” Later , Buxton [ 7 ] discussed the same principle in the domain of user experience design with reference to the same text . It is not clear from Bayles and Orland whether this ceramics class actually took place or if it is just fictitious event constructed to help readers more easily visualise the point . This study thus set out collect empirical evidence based on Bayles and Orland’s class experiment for a task of designing assistive technology to assess whether a focus on quantity leads to better quality in practice . The implications of this study can be illustrated by revisiting the example of online experimentation . Online Experimentation ( OE ) [ 8 , 9 ] involves learning through online and / or remote access to experiments . These can be virtual 2D and 3D simulations [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] , augmented reality simulations or virtual reality simulations . Typically , such systems include various types of sensors at remote sites to make the simulation more real . Online Experimentation is often made available through collaborative web platforms [ 13 , 14 ] . Typically , such a system will be engineered using the creators ’ first and best idea , and then improved in incremental steps until the result is satisfactory to the creators of the tool or framework . We argue that instead one should start more broadly and explore many possible ways of realising the online experience before committing to a particular approach . At each step the validity of the ideas should be tested on representatives from the target group ( in this case students ) thereby ending up with a more usable and engaging system that leads to improved learning effect among students . II . M ETHOD A . Experimental design A between groups design was chosen with design approach as independent variable with the two the levels quantitative goal and quality goal and frequency of solutions as dependent variables . B . Participants The class comprised a total of N = 106 bachelor students in their second year ( fourth semester ) studying computer engineering , information technology and applied computer science . Most of the students were applied computer science students . The main difference between these study programmes is the amount of mathematics and physics in the curriculum where applied computer science has the least of the traditional sciences . The class was divided into two groups according to the following criterion : As each enrolled student is assigned a running 6 - digit student number , this number was used as filtering criteria . Students with an odd student number were to solve the problem with quality as the main objective and was named yellow project . Students with an even student numbers were to solve the problem with quantity of solutions as the main objective . This was named the red project . In theory there should have been approximately a 50 / 50 students solving red and yellow projects , however , there were 62 students ( 58 . 5 % ) in the yellow group and 44 students ( 41 . 5 % ) in the red group . Most of the students in the class were in their 20s , while a handful of students were older . The gender balance was as follows : there were 16 females ( 15 . 1 % ) and 90 males ( 84 . 9 % ) in the class . Of these , 6 females ( 13 . 4 % ) solved the red project and 10 females ( 16 . 1 % ) solved the yellow project . C . Task The project was set as an individual assignment and conducted as their first hand - in in the course Human Computer Interaction , which is assessed using portfolios comprising one individual and two group projects . Two separate problem descriptions were developed based on the same basic problem . The problem was to develop a concept for text entry using just one key [ 15 ] . The students were not given any pointers to the literature . This problem is easy to understand and narrow in scope , yet few students have been exposed to this problem before . A bi - product of working with this problem is that students get familiarity with design for diversity and marginalized groups . Another advantage of this problem is the large number of possible solutions with varying levels of quality . The students assigned the yellow project were specifically instructed to develop the most efficient text entry method possible , while the students assigned the red project were specifically instructed to generate as many concepts as possible . The students were also told to analyse their designs using MacKenzie’s theoretical steps per character m odel [ 16 ] which uses the frequency of the alphabetic characters to estimate the average number of steps to input a character . To balance the workload the students solving the yellow project also had to develop a working prototype and perform a simple usability test of their method . The projects were documented as written reports . D . Analysis The written reports were manually analysed during the assessment phase , and the approaches devised by the students were categorized into several classes and coded for subsequent analysis . Although the two methods were not completely identical , they were considered one category if the principles were sufficiently similar to the given input strategy . The following main categories were identified : linear multitap where users press the button to move the letter forward one step [ 17 ] , Morse code with long and short presses [ 18 , 19 ] , multitap with grouping , binary codes , binary search [ 20 ] , Huffman codes as used in compression [ 21 ] , knock codes ( also known as Russian tap codes ) [ 22 ] , linear scanning [ 23 ] , row - column scanning [ 24 ] . Morse code , Huffman codes and binary codes are considered impractical early stage ideas which are theoretically efficient from an information theoretic perspective , but impractical from a cognitive and ergonomic perspective as they impose high memory demands on the users . Multitap , multitap with grouping and knock codes are more practical as they rely on the visual system instead of memory , while linear scanning and row - column scanning are considered the optimal designs as they require little work and little demand on memory , but instead takes longer . 2019 5th Experiment @ International Conference ( exp . at’19 ) June 12th – 14th , 2019 , University of Madeira , Funchal , Madeira , Portugal 173 4 . 9 % 2 . 4 % 19 . 5 % 22 . 0 % 22 . 0 % 7 . 3 % 7 . 3 % 4 . 9 % 7 . 3 % 2 . 4 % 0 . 0 % 5 . 0 % 10 . 0 % 15 . 0 % 20 . 0 % 25 . 0 % 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 F r e qu e n c y ( % ) No . solutions Fig . 1 . Distribution of solutions generated by the students focusing on quantity . These also represent the state of the art as assistive technologies used with switches for users having reduced physical function [ 25 , 26 , 27 ] . The data was gathered using Microsoft Excel and analysed using the open source statistics software JASP version 0 . 9 . 0 . 1 [ 28 ] . E . Ethics This study was carried out during the autumn of 2017 before the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) . The identities of the participants were anonymized as the analysis described herein was conducted after the course had finished . III . R ESULTS As instructed , students focusing on quality reported on a single solution , while most of the students who were asked to focus on quantity generated more than one solution ( M = 4 . 9 , SD = 2 . 2 ) . Fig . 1 shows the distribution of the number of concepts generated by the students that focused on quantity . Most of these groups produced 3 - 5 solutions . Only 4 . 9 % documented just one solution while 2 . 4 % of the students documented 10 concepts or more . Fig . 2 shows the distribution of the different concepts for the two groups . As expected , the frequencies are higher for all the categories for students focusing on quantity . The entropy of the distributions ( a measure of spread for categorical data ) shows that the students focusing on quantity explored more solutions ( Entropy = 2 . 84 ) than students focusing on quality ( Entropy = 1 . 66 ) . A contingency table analysis shows that these distributions for the wo groups are significantly different ( χ 2 ( 9 ) = 24 . 0 , p = . 004 ) . Among the group focusing on quantity , 68 . 2 % documented the basic multitap method , which was only documented by 25 . 8 % of the student focusing on quality . Among the students focusing on quality , row / column multitap was the most frequently reported with 32 . 3 % , while 36 . 4 % of the other group reported similar techniques . Fig . 2 also shows that among the methods that are considered optimal , 29 . 5 % among the quantity group reported linear scanning , while only 3 . 2 % ended up with the linear scanning concept among those focusing on quality . 0 . 0 % 3 . 2 % 0 . 0 % 4 . 8 % 4 . 8 % 14 . 5 % 3 . 2 % 32 . 3 % 4 . 8 % 25 . 8 % 2 . 3 % 4 . 5 % 15 . 9 % 18 . 2 % 25 . 0 % 27 . 3 % 29 . 5 % 36 . 4 % 56 . 8 % 68 . 2 % 0 . 0 % 20 . 0 % 40 . 0 % 60 . 0 % 80 . 0 % H u ff m a n c o d e k n o c k c o d e b i n a r y c o d e b i n a r y s e a r c h s c a nn i n g g r o up g r o up s c a nn i n g li n e a r r o w / c o l u m n m u l t i t a p m o r s e li n e a r m u l t i t a p F r e qu e n c y ( % ) Q u a n t i t y ( r e d ) Q u a li t y ( y e ll o w ) Fig . 2 . Distribution of solution types For what is considered the optimal solution , that is row / column scanning , 25 . 0 % of the quantity group reported this method , while only 4 . 8 % ended up with this concept among the quality group . These results thus agree with the claim that quantity lead to better quality than quality by itself . By focusing on quantity , the student had a 25 % chance of detecting the optimal solution , whilst when focusing on quality the students had less than 5 % chance of finding the optimal solution . Each student in the two groups were assessed based on the objectives of the respective two problem descriptions . To confirm that the type of assignment would not affect the students grade , the grades of the two groups were compared . A Mann - Whitney U Test shows that the grades for the two groups were not statistically different ( W = 1127 , p = . 969 ) . In order to identify any possible relationship between the quantity of solutions and the quality of the solutions , the quality of the solutions were categorized according to the following ordinal scale in increasing order of quality : 0 : code based solutions ( Morse , Huffman , binary ) , 1 : binary search , 2 : linear multitap , group , 3 : row / column multitap , Russian tap - code , 4 : linear scanning and 5 : row / column scanning . The quality of the concept designed by each student / group was therefore represented by the solution with the maximum quality . This quality was then correlated with the number of concepts designed by the students . A Spearman correlation shows that there is a strong positive and significant correlation between quantity of solutions and quality of solutions ( r s ( 44 ) = . 514 , p < . 001 ) . The correlation is depicted in Fig . 3 . IV . D ISCUSSION The results agree with the designers’ belief that quantity leads to quality and disagrees with the technological belief that quantity reduces quality . Clearly , the claim that quantity leads to quality is specific to the context where one is seeking the solution to a new and unknown problem , the process which designers call design . Unfortunately , the term design is often used differently by engineers and technologists to mean solving a known problem with specific methods , i . e . , such as designing the thickness of a weight carrying concrete beam . 2019 5th Experiment @ International Conference ( exp . at’19 ) June 12th – 14th , 2019 , University of Madeira , Funchal , Madeira , Portugal 174 y = 0 . 3874 x + 1 . 3316 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 qu a li t y qu a n t i t y Fig . 3 . Correlation between quantity and quality ( with dithering ) Technologists , especially computer scientists often come across problems where there are no straightforward methods for finding the solutions . We therefore argue for developing engineers and technology students design thinking skills . One of the major challenges is not to make students delve into a technical solution too quickly but rather explore other options . One approach is to specifically instruct students to present several alternatives and to make students reflect over the quality gains through the process . Another approach specific to computer science students is to impose a programming ban in a course , forcing students to find other ways to test out ideas , that is , low - fidelity prototyping with simple means . It is our experience that the notion of design thinking is also not widely accepted among the more computationally oriented faculty members . One way to persuade such individuals about the benefits of quantity of solutions may be to draw parallels to stochastic processes such as Monte Carlo methods [ 29 , 30 , 31 ] and stochastic optimization [ 32 , 33 ] where many pseudo - random solutions are generated by computers to find high quality solutions to complex problems . This study evolved around a case involving the design of assistive technology for individuals with reduced motor function . This is just an example . The notion of quality through quantity can be applied to nearly any development process and target group , including platforms for online experimentation targeting students . We argue that adopting a design thinking approach to the development of online experimentation platforms where one refines an array of ideas instead of improving upon a single idea will lead to more engaging and effective learning experiences for students . V . C ONCLUSIONS The paper described an experiment to explore the effect of emphasizing quality or quantity in a student design assignment . The results show that when students were asked to focus on quantity the resulting quality was better than when students focused on quality . The notion of quality through quantity is well established in the design disciplines while equating quantity with low quality is still a frequently believed myth within engineering and technological disciplines . Design thinking is increasingly important in order for engineers and technologists to solve tomorrow ’ s challenges . Students therefore need to be trained to explore a larger portion of the design space before settling on a specific engineering solution . R EFERENCES [ 1 ] G . S . Becker and H . G .
