This closure can be achieved through leader cell crawling or actomyosin - based 10 contraction , depending on the size of the gap . Here , we focus on wounds whose closure is driven 11 by interfacial instabilities , featuring both leader cell - driven fingers and actin - mediated contraction . 12 Our proposed model predicts a positive correlation between the frequency of fingering and the 13 overall speed of boundary closure . This fingering frequency is precisely regulated through the 14 orchestration of cell density - driven pressure , cell - cell repulsions , and the initial curvature of the 15 wound boundary . Our findings demonstrate an inverse correlation between fingering frequency 16 and boundary curvatures , indicating a " self - control " mechanism for closure rates independent of 17 the initial curvatures of the wound periphery . Notably , changes in curvature caused by fingering 18 formation generate force that aids in the healing process . 19 20 21 22 1 Introduction 23 Gap closure is a ubiquitous physiological phenomenon that occurs in response to external injuries 24 or internal apoptotic events during morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis 1 - 5 . Proper re - 25 epithelization is critical to close wounds , involving two modes of cellular migration : purse - string 26 contraction of the wound edge and crawling of the boundary cells 6 , 7 . Purse - string contraction 27 involves actomyosin cable contraction that spans over multiple cells along the boundary , whereas 28 leader cell crawling is achieved through the active emergence of lamellipodia 4 , 8 - 12 . Previous studies 29 have demonstrated the complementary actions of these two modes during wound closure 10 , 13 - 17 . 30 Smaller wounds or voids created by defects in the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) are closed 31 predominantly by purse - string - like contractions 15 , 16 . Wounds are considered small when 10 ~ 20 32 cells are aligned along the perimeter without any discontinuity in actomyosin cables . Larger 33 wounds , on the other hand , are closed through the active crawling of leader cells at the 34 boundary 10 , 14 . 35 Two distinct closing modes can , however , occur simultaneously in a cooperative manner to 36 expedite the closure 18 - 21 . The synergistic effects from the coexisting two modes have been 37 demonstrated both experimentally and computationally for small wounds 22 - 24 . Ravasio et al . 38 demonstrated the contribution of crawling forces during purse - string contractions in the small 39 wound by verifying a mathematical superposition of purse - string and crawling 22 . Furthermore , the 40 in silico model by Staddon et al . confirmed the increase in closure speed when two modes 41 contributed mutually , whose relative dominance depended on the size of local curvatures 23 . Both 42 studies suggested the cooperative effects of two modes for small wounds of high enough 43 curvatures ( 0 . 1 ~ 0 . 6μm - 1 ) spanning over a short perimeter of 10 ~ 20 cells . On the other hand , larger 44 2 wounds involve complex features like abrupt crawling protrusions of finger - like shape at the 45 regions of discontinued actomyosin cables 25 - 27 . As the convex fingers extrude further , concave 46 suspending - bridge - like actomyosin cables appear between the fingers , which resemble negative 47 curvature bridges on small wound boundaries and are expected to contribute to overall wound 48 closure through purse - string mechanisms as the concave strains developed 10 , 14 , 28 - 30 . Although the 49 development of purse - string contractions following the outgrowth of fingers would be an 50 important process for the closing of large wounds , the descriptions for fingering extrusions and 51 contraction of bridges mostly remain in stochastic models 28 , 31 , 32 . However , Vishwakarma M . et al . 52 recently discovered that the adjacent fingers were equally space along the boundary , whose length 53 scale was similar to the correlation length of cellular forces within the monolayer 33 . These findings 54 led us to postulate that the fingering extrusion must be governed by the physical forces of 55 constituent cells in the layer as being a well - regulated phenomenon to close the gap . Here , we aim 56 to elucidate this intriguing event based on a mathematical model and quantification tools for 57 cellular dynamics . 58 In this study , we focus on the closing event of reasonably large wounds , typically of 100s - 1000s 59  m in radius , where both modes of closure are important . To elucidate the closing mechanism , we 60 first identify the role of fingers in wound closures based on a simple mathematical isotropic line - 61 tension model that reflects forces along the fingering patterns . Comparing the mathematical model 62 and experimental results clarifies that fingering extrusion controls overall wound closure and is 63 orchestrated by density gradient - driven cell flux and the initial boundary curvatures of the wound 64 boundary . 65 66 3 Results 67 Initial diameter - dependent fingering protrusion dictates dynamic changes in wound 68 boundary . 69 In this study , the wounds are created by culturing the MDCK ( Madin - Darby Canine Kidney cells ) 70 monolayer with a PDMS stencil for 18 hrs and carefully removing the stencils to obtain a smooth 71 wound edge of the desired shape and size ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . We use circular wounds of various initial 72 radii ( R initial ) ranging from 150μm to 500μm and a straight one to investigate the effect of the initial 73 wound curvature ( κ initial = 1 / R initial ) to confirm the previously reported correlation between the 74 initial curvature and the wound closing modes 22 . Consistently with existing reports , the small 75 wound ( R initial = 150μm ) shows a shrinking with a smooth boundary , predominantly via purse - 76 string - like contraction . In contrast , the wound of larger radii ( R initial = 250 , 500μm ,  ) shows a 77 rough interface due to the actively protruding cells at the onset of the closure ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . As a 78 reference , a 150μm radius ( 942μm in perimeter ) corresponds to roughly ~ 30 cells , and a 500μm 79 radius ( 3142μm in perimeter ) includes ~ 100 cells . As shown in the boundary trajectories of a large 80 wound ( R initial = 500μm ) , the initially smooth boundary begins to exhibit periodic waves formed 81 by the emergence of extruding fingers ( Fig . 1 ( c ) ) . As the fingers extruded further , a local concave 82 bridge between two adjacent fingers is naturally developed , and this local concave region is termed 83 " valley " henceforth . The difference in the advancing speeds of the closing boundary between the 84 fast - moving fingers and the slow - moving valleys causes an increase in negative curvature of the 85 valley ( Fig . 1 ( d ) ) . Soon after , valley regions begin to accelerate , possibly to avoid the excess 86 negative curvatures , gradually smoothening the boundary trajectories as shown clearly in Fig . 1 ( d ) 87 from a dashed blue ( t = 7hr ) line to a dotted green ( t = 8hr ) line . Here , we define the roughness index 88 4 ( RI ) of the wound boundary as the ratio between the contour perimeter and the convex hull 89 perimeter ( Fig . 1 ( e ) ) . For the smallest wound closure ( R = 75μm ) , the RI persistently decreases 90 throughout the closure , indicating a smooth shrinking over time without any finger formation . For 91 larger wounds of R initial > 150μm , however , the RI curves exhibit positive slopes during earlier 92 times ( 0 ~ 6 hrs ) , reflecting the initial formation of fingers . Once the RI reaches its peak value , it 93 slowly decays over time , which suggests the temporal maintenance of fingers and valleys ( Fig . 94 1 ( e ) ) . The maximum RI value and the duration over which higher RI value is maintained positively 95 correlate with the R initial , which reflects the more prominent effect of the fingers on the closure of 96 larger wounds . To investigate the basis for the R initial - dependent RI profile , we further quantify two 97 major characteristics of the fingers , namely the finger amplitudes and the finger - to - finger distance 98 ( FFD ) . The amplitude is defined as the length of fingers from the inscribed circle of boundaries 99 after 6 hrs from the protrusion . The FFD is the distance between the adjacent fingers . As shown 100 in Fig . S1 , the finger amplitude shows insignificant dependence on the R initial , whereas the FFD 101 exhibits a notable negative correlation with the R initial ( Fig . 1 ( f ) ) , suggesting that the occurrence of 102 the fingers predominantly influences the RI profile than their amplitudes . When the FFD is plotted 103 as a function of time for R initial = 500μm , the formations and falls of the FFD , reflecting the genesis 104 and merger of the fingers , clearly show slow decays similar with the maintenance of RI in larger 105 wounds , where the red dotted line represents the mean value of 17 samples ( Fig . 1 ( g ) ) . On the 106 other hand , the FFD changes for R initial = 150μm showed drastic decrease corresponding to the RI 107 changes in small wounds , where the red dotted line represents the man value of 8 samples ( Fig . 108 1 ( g ) ) . The corresponding decaying of FFD values in the plot supports the changes of RI reflects 109 the fingering dynamics along the boundary . 110 5 Based on these observations , we propose that wound closure in the epithelial cell layer occurs in 111 three distinct regimes ( Fig . 1 ( h ) ) . During regime ( i ) , the extrusion of fingers gradually increases 112 the boundary roughness . Once wave - like sequential finger and valley structures develop , the rough 113 boundary is maintained during regime ( ii ) , as the valley regions follow the extruding fingertips . In 114 the shrinking regime ( iii ) , fingers disappear , and wound closure is accomplished by contraction of 115 the smooth boundary . Especially , the initial boundary radius ( R initial ) and fingering characteristics , 116 such as finger frequency ( FFD ) and finger amplitudes , dictate the closing process of wounds via 117 controlling the span of each regime in the closure ( Fig . 1 ( i ) ) . Thus , the following sections of this 118 paper extensively explore the roles of these variables on wound closure , with fingering extrusion 119 serving as a key parameter for controlling the closing performance . 120 6 121 Fig . 1 Fingering extrusions along the wound boundary with various curvatures formed by PDMS stencils .

At the steady state where the boundary roughness is maintained at a constant level 139 ( regime ( ii ) of Fig . 1 ( h ) ) , the force equilibrium is assumed between the crawling force at the fingers 140 ( F ) and the line tension ( T ) at the boundary as follows , 141 𝐹 (cid:3398) 2𝑇 ∙ 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 (cid:3404) 0 ( 1 ) 142 where θ is the angle between the vertical axis of fingertips and the tangent line of the finger 143 boundary ( Fig . 2 ( a ) ) . By simplifying the valleys to spatially repetitive circular arcs , the force 144 equilibrium of the valley region ( curvature = 1 / 𝑟 (cid:3049)(cid:2998) ) with a line tension and constant velocity ( 𝑣 ) 145 of the boundary can be expressed as , 146 (cid:3021) (cid:3045) (cid:3297)(cid:3246) (cid:3404) 𝜇 ∙ 𝑣 ( 2 ) 147 where the μ is a viscous friction coefficient , inclusive of resistance caused by both cell - cell and 148 cell - substrate adhesions ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . To validate these relationships for given T and μ , we measure 149 the velocity and boundary curvature ( 1 / 𝑟 (cid:3049)(cid:2998) ) of the valley from the experimental data , confirming 150 the linear correlation between these two quantities ( Eq . 2 ) as shown in Fig . 2 ( c ) . Here , the 151 instantaneous boundary velocity ( 𝑣 ) is measured by tracking the vertical displacement at a 1 - hr 152 interval , and the temporal changes in curvature are displayed by the color gradation in the plot . 153 Interestingly , the finger velocities , marked by the purple - pink scale , are clustered around 30 μ m / h 154 with no apparent dependency on the boundary curvature ( 1 / 𝑟 (cid:3049)(cid:2998) ) ( Fig . 2 ( c ) ) . These experimental 155 8 data are well reflected on the spatiotemporal graph for the representative fingering extrusion that 156 shows an almost constant slope as a function of time ( Fig . 2 ( d ) ) . In contrast , the valley region 157 exhibits a distinct slope change at around 10hrs ( Fig . 2 ( e ) ) . 158 In the case of the overall wound closure , one can expect the repetitive extrusions of fingers to 159 influence the overall closing speeds . From the relationship between the radius of curvature and the 160 finger - to - finger distance ( FFD ) , i . e . , 2𝑟 (cid:3049)(cid:2998) 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 (cid:3404) 𝐹𝐹𝐷 , shown in Fig . 2 ( f ) , the boundary migration 161 of straight wounds ( R initial = ∞ ) can be expressed as the relationship between F , FFD , and the 162 overall wound closure speeds 𝑣 (cid:3042)(cid:3030) as follows ( Fig . 2 ( f ) ) . 163 (cid:3007) (cid:3007)(cid:3007)(cid:3005) (cid:3404) 𝜇 ∙ 𝑣 (cid:3042)(cid:3030) ( 3 ) 164 Here , Eq 3 lies on the assumption that tensional force 𝑇 and friction coefficient 𝜇 are isotropic 165 and constant with respect to local radius change , inferring the linear relationship between the v oc 166 to the fingering frequency ( ~ 1 / FFD ) in the straight wound geometry . To experimentally test the 167 effect of initial fingering emergence on the overall wound closing rate , the average velocity values 168 of the boundary measured over 20 hrs are plotted against 1 / FFD of the corresponding samples at 169 the moment where fingers begin to emerge ( t = 6 hrs ) as shown in Fig . 2 ( g , h ) . The results confirm 170 a clear positive correlation between the overall closing rate of the wound and the initial fingering 171 frequency . Furthermore , given that cell density acts as a driving factor for bulk motion within cell 172 monolayer , we investigate the effect of initial cell density (  o ) on the overall closing rate as shown 173 in Fig . 2 ( i ) . Interestingly , the correlation strength between v oc and  o is notably weaker than that 174 between v oc and 1 / FFD , marked by the R 2 value . On the other hand ,  o shows the strongest 175 correlation ( R 2 = 0 . 8916 ) to the early fingering emergence ( 1 / FFD ) ( Fig . 2 ( j ) ) . The result implies 176 9 that the  o must act as an upstream cue that contributes to the emergence of the initial fingers , 177 whose numbers eventually impact the overall v oc as schematically illustrated in Fig . 2 ( k ) . 178 Thus far , we have clarified the direct role of fingers on the wound closure rate and identified the 179 factors that regulate fingering frequency . Higher density is a primary candidate that increases the 180 initial frequency of fingers ( Fig . 2 ( j ) ) , while the higher curvature of the boundary resists the 181 emergence of fingers ( Fig . 1 ( f ) ) . Therefore , the following section will extensively analyze the role 182 of these factors in the regulation of fingering frequency . 183 10 184 Fig . 2 Effects of finger - valley structures on wound closure speeds based on the line tension model .

The spatial 200 differences in densities create a local density gradient ( ∇  ) within the monolayer that can perturb 201 the velocity fields of cells due to the particle characteristics of diffusive migration . As shown in 202 the series of cellular area ( 1 /  ) map in Fig . 3 ( b ) , the compressed cells in the high - density region 203 develop the diverging velocity field towards the neighbors while their sizes relax to enlarge ( Fig . 204 3 ( b ) ) . The temporal plots for divergence and cellular area exhibit similar profiles , yet with a phase 205 shift by ~ 2hrs , suggesting a possible role of the cellular density in developing the velocity 206 divergence within the monolayer ( Fig . 3 ( c ) ) . To quantify the similarity between the two plots , we 207 analyze the cross - correlation of divergence and unbiased cellular area calculated by subtracting 208 the background decreasing trend caused by the increase in cell density . As shown in Fig . 3 ( d , e ) , 209 the divergence and cellular area ( 1 /  ) demonstrate a fairly high correlation ( r average = 0 . 55 ) with 210 approximately 2 hrs time delay ( lag average = 1h 45min ) . The cellular fluxes generated from the 211 diverging source is transmitted to the boundary through intimate cell - cell junctions within the 212 monolayer . This transmitted flux then can induce a thrusting pressure to form fingering extrusions 213 at the boundary . To confirm this assumption , the spatiotemporal velocity changes in an ROI near 214 the fingering extruding boundary in Fig . 3 ( f ) are analyzed ( Fig . 3 ( g - h ) ) . The kymograph of velocity 215 divergences exhibits several diagonal lines from the posterior region to the boundary , attributing 216 to the spatiotemporal propagations of cell fluxes toward the boundary . Notably , the divergence 217 source ( red ) is sequentially displaced toward the boundary until the emergence of the fingering 218 12 extrusion ( marked by red arrowheads ) . Consistently , diagonal lines in the kymograph of unbiased 219 velocity obtained by removing mean velocities account for the propagation of fluxes from the inner 220 monolayer leading to the formation of the fingers ( Fig . 3 ( h ) ) . Based on these quantified results , we 221 confirm that the propagation of heterogeneous density - driven cell flux is the key mechanism for 222 initiation of new finger extrusion at the boundary . 223 It is interesting to note that sporadically dividing cells naturally promote heterogeneity in densities , 224 generating pressure against neighboring cells as the daughter cells expand ( Fig . 3 ( i ) ) . Given the 225 highly proliferating nature of MDCK cells , it can be assumed that cell divisions sufficiently 226 provoke divergences of velocity vectors , eventually leading to fingering extrusions . To test this 227 hypothesis , we quantified the changes in cellular area ( 1 / ρ ) near the boundary while attenuating 228 cell division through thymidine treatments . Thymidine arrests the cell cycle at the G1 / S phase , 229 thereby inhibiting cell division . As shown in Fig . 3 ( j - l ) , the mean cellular area shows periodic 230 fluctuations in the untreated control conditions , whereas the mean cellular area continues to 231 increase without fluctuations when cell division is inhibited by thymidine ( Fig . S2 ) . The 232 emergence and propagation of velocity divergence ( Fig . 3 ( g ) ) that act as cues for additional 233 fingering extrusions also arise from dynamic fluctuations during the cell dividing process ( Fig . S3 , 234 Mov . S1 ) , resulting in an increase in the number of fingers only when cells are actively dividing 235 ( Fig . 3 ( m ) ) . Inhibition of cell division naturally leads to the suppression of fingering formation in 236 later time ( > 10hrs ) ( Fig . 3 ( m ) ) . Conclusively , we have identified a critical role of cell division in 237 the emergence of fingers by initiating divergences in the velocity vector field , acting as a local 238 perturbation in density and velocity . Furthermore , in addition to the density - driven pressures , the 239 initial polarity of traction forces also exhibits correlated results for the fingering positions . As 240 shown in Fig . S4 ( a , b ) , the pre - polarized traction vectors to the normal direction to the boundary 241 13 interface , which coincide with the crawling force of boundary cells , are shown to be localized at 242 the immediate posterior region of the future fingers . This result suggests that the polarity of 243 tractions near the boundary can determine where the crawling forces would accumulate to initiate 244 the formation of fingers . 245 246 14 Fig . 3 Dynamics of the cell populations in monolayer induced the fingering extrusions at the boundary 247 ( a ) Heterogeneously distributed cell density in the spatiotemporal domain , ( b ) Visualized results for the 248 relationships between cellular density and cell fluxes ( Green arrows = velocity vectors , Color map = Area 249 of cells ) , ( c ) Comparison of changes in divergences and cellular area at the same domain during the wound 250 closure , ( d , e ) Box plots for the correlation coefficient and time shift between divergence and cellular area 251 plots , ( f ) Images of fingering extrusions in the region of interests , the red arrow heads indicate the location 252 of fingering formations , ( g , h ) The kymograph of the divergence and unbiased velocity .

As shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) , a negative  initial at the boundary causes the converging flux of 264 cells from the dense reservoir toward the center of the wound . In this scenario , the degree of 265 convergence would increase with  initial , which is predicted to result in a faster closure of the 266 wounds ( ΔA = constant , v oc ∝  initial ) with a higher fingering frequency . To test this prediction , 267 we analyze the overall closure rate ( v oc ) and ΔA as the parameters to assess the wound closure ( Fig . 268 4 ( b ) ) . The experimental data , however , show the positive linear relationship between ΔA and R initial 269 ( 1 /  initial ) , contradicting our prediction ( Fig . 4 ( c ) ) . Consequently , the overall closure rate 270 ( ΔA / 2π R initial ) shows an almost independent relationship with  initial ( Fig . 4 ( d ) ) . In addition , the 271 previously obtained relationship between FFD and R initial ( Fig . 1 ( f ) ) exhibits the opposite result to 272 prediction . The number of cells between neighboring fingers , another parameter for the inverse of 273 fingering frequency , also displays larger values as  initial increases ( Fig . S5 ) . Since the fingering 274 frequency has been found to linearly correlates with the wound closure speeds ( Fig . 2 ( f ) ) , the 275 15  initial - independent v oc can be understood as a consequence of the counteractions between 276 converging effects and downregulation of fingering extrusions at higher  initial wound boundaries . 277 278 The regulation of fingering extrusions induces the wound closures independent of the initial 279 curvature . 280 The previously verified linear correlation between the fingering frequency and the wound closure 281 rate is based on the assumption that the initial curvature of the wound is infinity ( i . e . straight 282 wounds ) . Therefore , in order to generalize the relationship between the fingering frequency and 283 the wound closure speeds , consideration of additional effect from the initial curvature values is 284 necessary . As shown in Fig . 4 ( e ) , the constituent components of boundary shapes such as R initial , 285 fingering amplitude ( h ) , and fingering frequency ( n f = 1 / FFD ) determine the local curvature of the 286 valley ( 1 / r v ' ) that reflects the contractile force ( T / r v ' ) for wound closures .

S6 ) . The h value is already 291 confirmed as an independent value to the R initial changes ( Fig . S1 ) , which ranges from 40 to 70μm , 292 supporting the validity of the optimized value . After fixing the h to the optimized value , we can 293 plot the contour map of r v ' according to the L and R initial , followed by laying over the experimental 294 data on the contour map for comparison ( Fig . 4 ( f ) ) . The data points are well distributed on the 295 16 suggested decaying contour with optimized h and r v ' ( marked in gray ) , which confirms that the 296 regulation of finger extrusion by R initial must cause the constant r v ' to be independent of R initial . It is 297 notable that the experimental data for r v ' values in the wounds of various  initial , indeed , exhibit 298 nonsignificant differences for various initial radii and the value similar to the expected r v ' ( marked 299 in gray ) ( Fig . 4 ( g ) ) . This result confirms the independent wound closure speeds shown in Eq . ( 2 ) . 300 These intriguing results imply that the retardance of fingering extrusions in the wounds of larger 301  initial correlates with the conservation of r v ' and closure rate in circular wounds of varying sizes 302 with varying curvatures . 303 Based on these results , the proposed wound closure steps in Fig . 1 ( h ) can be explained as an 304 orchestration of cell density - driven pressure , cell - cell repulsions , and initial boundary curvature . 305 As shown in Fig . 4 ( h ) , the degree of roughness in the wound boundary is influenced by the initial 306 cellular density and is further perturbed by cell division - induced fingering . The cellular density 307 acts as an upstream cue for controlling fingering frequency , and those fingers link the density to 308 the wound closure rate via shaping the curvature of valleys ( 1 / r v ' ) Fig . 4 ( i ) . Contrary to expectations , 309 the convergence of cells towards the center of the wound caused by negative initial curvature does 310 not result in higher fingering frequency ; rather , the frequency is inversely correlated with initial 311 curvature ( 1 / R initial ) . Consequently , this counterbalanced decrease in fingering frequency equalizes 312 the wound closure rate by forming similar local curvatures along the valley independent to the 313 initial curvatures . 314 17 315 Fig . 4 Changes in wound closure rates and fingering extrusions from the initial wound curvature 316 differences .

At first , we check the changes in the density - related characteristics while varying the 332  initial . The cellular density near the boundary , that are considered a dominant factor for inducing 333 fluxes and initial fingers , exhibits no significant differences for the different values of  initial ( Fig . 334 S7 ( a , b ) ) . Spatiotemporal changes of densities also do not exhibit any distinctive patterns amongst 335 various initial radii ( or  initial ) ( Fig . S7 ( c - e ) ) . When the alignment of traction force , the proposed 336 factor for determining the fingering extrusion region ( Fig . S4 ) , is examined , the vector field of 337 traction forces near the boundary is considerably aligned to the radial direction independent of the 338 wound diameter at the initial time as shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) . When traction alignments at 0hr and 3 hrs 339 are compared in the wounds of 3 different sizes , the vectors in only the smallest wound 340 ( R initial = 150μm ) show a noticeable loss in the alignment and random distribution of vectors at 3hr . 341 For quantification of the radial alignment of traction force , the fraction of vectors between - 30˚ 342 and 30˚ to the radial axis is calculated ( Fig . 5 ( b ) ) . As shown in Fig . 5 ( c ) , the proportion of aligned 343 traction vectors has a similar value at the initial time point , but after 3 hrs , the proportion of aligned 344 vectors of the R initial = 150μm condition significantly decreases . From these results , we propose that 345 the initial development of fingers must occur irrespective of the  initial but additional finger 346 formation is retarded by disoriented traction vectors for small wounds of higher negative curvature . 347 Timely maturation of the actomyosin structures whose function is to counterbalance the fingering 348 extrusions 14 , could also contribute to the suppression of finger formations during the closure ( Fig . 349 5 ( d , e ) ) . Interestingly , after 4 hrs , the radius of multicellular actomyosin curvatures ( R actomyosin ) are 350 mostly distributed below 200μm , which coincides with the critical R initial where the fingering 351 19 frequency is dramatically decreased ( Fig . 5 ( f ) ) . Based on these data , we postulate that the 352 suppressed finger formation at the higher negative curvature levels may be induced by the 353 maturation of actomyosin cables . Alternatively , from the correspondence between the previously 354 proposed r v ' ( Fig . 4 ( h ) ) and the R actomyosin , the " self - control " of r v ' value may be the consequence 355 of the curvatures of actomyosin rings that induce contraction force for cell migration . 356 The position of cells can also have the suppressing effect for finger development . In various 357 cellular migration models , the intercellular distance has been considered as an important factor 358 that contribute in determining the intercellular energy between neighboring cells . One type of 359 energy from the cell - cell interactions is repulsive potential with Gaussian shapes ( 𝑈(cid:4666)𝑟(cid:4667) (cid:3404) 360 𝜀𝑒 (cid:3436)(cid:2879) (cid:3293)(cid:3118) (cid:3345)(cid:3118) (cid:3440) ) , that captures the mildly repulsive system like cells 46 . In the initially curved wound 361 boundary , the boundary cells would increase this repulsive potential as they move forward due to 362 the intrinsic curvature effect ( Fig . 5 ( g ) ) . As shown in Fig . 5 ( h ) , the mathematical model predicts a 363 dramatic increase in the repulsive potential at the smaller R initial condition . When the cell - cell 364 distance is decreased to d c , 0 = 20μm , which represents the extremely high density of cells , the 365 effect of the increase in potential becomes insignificant when R initial = 150 μ m . As the cells are 366 known to generate the repulsion force by neighboring cells close enough 34 , 35 , the relative position 367 of a cell with respect to the other neighbors can determine the direction of the total repulsion force , 368 allowing us to predict the direction of cell protrusion ( Fig . 5 ( i ) ) . As shown in Fig . 5 ( j ) , the wounds 369 of all three sizes show higher distributions of backward - directed repulsions force vectors that work 370 against the extrusion of fingers . 371 To confirm the importance of the multicellular actomyosin ring and repulsion potentials in 372 suppressing finger formation , we conducted an analysis while inhibiting myosin activity with 373 20 blebbistatin ( 25μM ) . As shown in Fig . 5 ( k ) , the average number of fingers was higher in the 374 blebbistatin - treated condition , confirming the significant suppressive function of actomyosin rings 375 in finger extrusion . However , both conditions showed a dramatic decrease in fingering frequency 376 for smaller wounds with a closer cell - cell distance , indicating that repulsive potential based on cell 377 position also plays a critical role in modifying finger extrusion . In these cytoskeletal - based 378 analyses , we acknowledge that the physical forces due to negative curvature make it challenging 379 for boundary cells to form fingers . 380 21 381 Fig . 5 Mechanisms for retarding the fingering extrusions in the wounds with higher initial curvatures .

During the wound closure , the 399 fingers are formed by leader cells that crawl faster than neighboring cells , and the cells in the 400 concave valley regions between fingers accelerate to catch up by utilizing contractile forces to 401 smoothen the roughness . If the speed disparities between the leaders in the fingers and neighboring 402 cells were to be maintained , the finger amplitudes would continue to grow , resulting in increasing 403 boundary roughness . The roughness index ( RI ) value rose quickly as fingers emerge , saturated at 404 a constant level while fingers and valleys move at a similar level , and fell until fingers were 405 suppressed and the wound was closed by the contraction of the actomyosin cable . We identified 406 the driving factors for fingering extrusions as cellular density and the global curvature of the initial 407 boundary , demonstrating how the finger - valley structure immediately affected wound closure rates 408 via inter - controlled crawling and boundary contraction by external factors like initial curvatures 409 and cellular density . 410 In order to investigate the impact of fingering characteristics on wound closure rates , we 411 developed a simple mathematical model for the curvature along the fingers . Our findings revealed 412 that the correlation between fingering frequency and wound closure rate was stronger than the 413 relationship between cellular density and wound closure rate , which is typically the primary 414 mechanism for collective cell migration . We also found that cellular density had a stronger 415 correlation with fingering frequency , indicating that cellular density plays an upstream role in 416 finger generation . We confirmed that the gradient of cellular density induced diverging cell fluxes , 417 which were then transmitted to the extruding location of fingers via cell - cell adhesions . Cell 418 24 division also played a crucial role in increasing fingering frequency by forming divergence and 419 reducing the velocity correlation length in the monolayer ( Fig . S8 ) . Based on previous work by 420 Vishwakarma M . et al . , which explains the occurrence of additional fingers when the mechanical 421 stress correlation lengths are shorter , we hypothesized that the dividing rate or initial cell density 422 would determine the physical correlation lengths for velocity or mechanical stress between cells 423 that ultimately determine the occurrence of fingers 33 . 424 The initial concave curve at the wound boundary induced the converging cell flux from the 425 monolayer , predicting more fingering extrusions as the curvature rose . However , fingering 426 extrusion was suppressed at higher curvatures , which aligned with a mathematical relationship for 427 uniform curvature values , regardless of the initial curvatures . Additionally , experiments revealed 428 insignificant differences in local valley curvatures between samples with different initial global 429 curvature values . These results demonstrate that the fingering frequency must be finely regulated 430 to meet a certain valley curvature value irrespective of the global boundary shapes . In addition , the 431 wound boundary maintained a similar closing speed regardless of the initial curvature of the wound , 432 employing a " self - control " mechanism likely to maximize closure efficiency by regulating energy 433 costs . By controlling the finger protrusion and valley contraction to maintain the overall roughness 434 of the boundary at a moderate wound closure speed , undesired stretching of cells and rupture of 435 fingers can also be prevented . Along the boundary , the multicellular actomyosin arc formed , acting 436 as obstacles against protruding lamellipodia to counterbalance the crawling fingers . We have also 437 observed a similarity in length scale between the characteristic radius of valley curvature and the 438 radius of the actomyosin arc , suggesting the possible existence of a characteristic length of the 439 actomyosin arc that induces contractile migrations . 440 25 Furthermore , our research has shown that the fingering extrusion is determined by the relative 441 positions of the cells , which reflect the physical potential of each constituent cell . This 442 phenomenon is similar to the change in melting temperature at solid - liquid interfaces , which is 443 influenced by exterior curvatures as described by the Gibbs - Thomson equations 36 . We also have 444 observed that the protrusion of fingers driven by cellular flux can be explained by adjusting the 445 particle movements with a soft repulsion force . This provides further insight into the mechanisms 446 behind fingering extrusion and highlights the importance of considering the physical properties 447 and interactions of individual cells in these processes . Overall , our approach to the complex 448 biological event is significant because it can be generalized to broader physical phenomenon . 449 Therefore , the proposed mechanisms are anticipated to be utilized in various contexts to simplify 450 the complex biophysical systems that feature rough boundaries with multiple protrusions . 451 452 453 26 Material and methods 454 Cell Culture 455 MDCK ( Mardin Darby canine kidney ) cell line , derived from normal epithelial cells of the dog 456 kidney , was cultured in DMEM ( Gibco , USA ) media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum 457 and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . In both culture and live imaging systems , cells were maintained 458 in a humified incubator with 5 % CO2 and 37°C . 459 Fabrication and adaptation of silicone stencils for making wounds 460 The PDMS ( polydimethylsiloxane ) silicone oil ( Sylgard 184 , Downing corning ) was utilized to 461 make the stencils with various embossed shapes for wounds . The PDMS elastomer was cured in a 462 10 : 1 ratio with a curing agent and poured into the SU - 8 wafer fabricated by the photo - lithography 463 methods ( MIcroFIT , Seongnam , Korea ) . After removing the residual gases inside of the PDMS 464 through the Vacuum container , we cured the PDMS for at least 3 hrs in the oven ( > 65˚C ) . The 465 cured PDMS stencil was gently detached from the wafer and cut into the block that contains a 466 similar shape of embossed structures with various sizes . Each block was treated with the oxygen 467 plasma to make a hydrophilic surface for preventing the bubble generation from loads of cell 468 suspensions . The PDMS blocks were attached to glass - bottom dishes , and the cell suspension was 469 gently put between the blocks and glasses . Then , we incubated cells until they form the monolayer 470 except for the embossed structures . 471 Live cell imaging 472 Phase - contrast images for observing the cell movements and fluorescent images for 473 displacements of the substrate were taken every 10 ~ 15 minutes using a 5X objective lens . All 474 27 experiments on the live - cell imaging were conducted on the Axiovert 200M ( Carl Zeiss ) 475 microscope with an incubating system ( 37°C and 5 % CO2 ) . 476 Quantification of curvature along the wound boundary 477 Local curvatures of valley regions were measured from a circle passing three points : the center 478 and both ends of valleys . The curvature value was a reciprocal number of the circle radius , and the 479 center of the circle determined the sign of curvature . If the center point is located at the exterior of 480 the cell layer ( wounded region ) , the curvature sign would be negative . 481 Visualization of cell motilities via the DPIV method 482 The quantification of cell migration was conducted by visualizing cellular motilities . For the 483 visualization of cells , we adjusted the DPIV ( digital particle image velocimetry ) method to the 484 sequence of phase images . The commercial software , Image Velocimetry Tool for MATLAB , 485 calculated the cross - correlation between cell images 37 . The double - pass PIV by the Fast Fourier 486 Transform ( FFT ) window deformation algorithm was used for the calculation . We determined the 487 first window size for 32∙32 pixels ( 64∙64μm2 ) and the second window size of 16∙16 pixels 488 ( 32∙32μm2 ) with an 8 pixels ( 16 μm ) interval that is similar to the length of single cells . In this 489 way , the velocity vector fields of the cell monolayer were gained . Other motility factors , like 490 divergence and correlation length , could be calculated from the vector data . 491 Proliferation controls of cell 492 To control the proliferation of cells , we adapted the thymidine , DNA synthesis inhibitor , 493 treatment . Six hrs before starting the wound closure experiment , thymidine was added to the cell 494 group to a final concentration of 2mM for waiting ; the cells were arrested at the G1 / S boundary . 495 28 Immunostaining of cell cytoskeletons 496 For the immunofluorescence staining , 4 % paraformaldehyde was used to fix the cell layer for 20 497 min at room temperature , then the cells were rinsed with PBS at least three times . The fixed cell 498 layer was permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15min with an ice pack and washed 499 three times with PBS . To block the unspecific binding , we incubated the cell layer in the 3 % BSA 500 in PBS in the incubator for 30mins . After blocking , the cells were incubated in the primary 501 antibody in 3 % BSA with a 1 : 100 ratio at 4°C overnight . Next , the samples were rinsed three times 502 with 3 % BSA and additionally incubated with a secondary antibody ( Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - 503 rabbit antibody ( A11008 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ) in 3 % BSA with a 1 : 200 ratio at room 504 temperature for 2 hrs . For staining the actin cytoskeletons and nucleus , Rhodamine - phalloidin 505 ( R415 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in 3 % BSA with a 1 : 50 ratio and 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole 506 ( DAPI , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were employed , respectively . 507 Hydrogel - based traction force visualization substratum 508 Mapping forces of cells require the soft gel that can be deformed by the cellular traction force . 509 The deformable soft gel was made from the polyacrylamide ( PA ) gel , which could regulate its 510 stiffness by changing the composition . For capturing the deformation of gels , the fluorescent beads 511 layer between cells and PA gel was adopted . The mixture of PA gel and fluorescent beads 512 ( diameter = 0 . 5um ) was polymerized on the glass bottom dish and simultaneously centrifuged to 513 pull the beads to the top surface of the gel . Next , the polymerized PA gel was treated with 514 sulfosuccinimidyl - 6 - ( 4 - azido - 2 - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( Sulfo - SANPAH ; Proteochem ) 1 515 mg / ml in 50 mM HEPES buffer ( Life Technologies ) and added 50 μg / ml collagen type I ( PureCol ; 516 Advanced BioMatrix ) for being an adaptable gel for cell living . 517 29 Traction force microscopy via Fourier transformation 518 The map for the traction force fields of the cell monolayer was measured from the deformation 519 of PA - gels , which is visualized by the displacement of the fluorescent beads layer . We used the 520 unconstrained Fourier transform traction microscopy by utilizing the previously published 521 algorithms 38 - 40 adapted in MATLAB software . 522 Statistical Analysis 523 Statistical data were analyzed using Origin and Excel software . The box plotting of data was 524 conducted by using the Origin software , and the Excels and MATLAB software handled other 525 plots . For the statistical results , the data were compared using the Mann - Whitney test and One - 526 Way ANOVA in Origin software . Statistical significance is marked as * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * 527 P < 0 . 001 . 528 Acknowledgments 529 J . J . Fredberg ' s lab generously provided TFM and MSM codes at Harvard T . H .
