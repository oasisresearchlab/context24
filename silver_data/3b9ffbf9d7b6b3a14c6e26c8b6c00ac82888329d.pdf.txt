BMC Public Health Impact of tiered measures on social contact and mixing patterns of in Italy during the second wave of COVID - 19 Michele Tizzani 1 * , Alessandro De Gaetano 1 , Christopher I .

Italy was one of the first countries to be affected by the pandemic , imposing a hard lockdown , in the first epidemic wave . During the second wave , the country implemented progressively restrictive tiers at the regional level according to weekly epidemiological risk assessments . This paper quantifies the impact of these restrictions on contacts and on the reproduction number . Methods Representative ( with respect to age , sex , and region of residence ) longitudinal surveys of the Italian popu - lation were undertaken during the second epidemic wave . Epidemiologically relevant contact patterns were meas - ured and compared with pre - pandemic levels and according to the level of interventions experienced by the par - ticipants . Contact matrices were used to quantify the reduction in the number of contacts by age group and contact setting . The reproduction number was estimated to evaluate the impact of restrictions on the spread of COVID - 19 . Results The comparison with the pre - pandemic baseline shows a significant decrease in the number of contacts , independently from the age group or contact settings . This decrease in the number of contacts significantly depends on the strictness of the non - pharmaceutical interventions . For all levels of strictness considered , the reduction in social mixing results in a reproduction number smaller than one . In particular , the impact of the restriction on the number of contacts decreases with the severity of the interventions . Conclusions The progressive restriction tiers implemented in Italy reduced the reproduction number , with stricter interventions associated with higher reductions . Readily collected contact data can inform the implementation of mitigation measures at the national level in epidemic emergencies to come .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 and public health institutions relied on interventions aimed at reducing individual and collective social con - tacts among the general population , in parallel with the enforcement of hygiene measures , such as wearing a mask [ 1 ] . How effective were these measures at reducing epidemiologically relevant contact patterns ? What is the relationship between the stringency of restrictions and the number of contacts made ? In this context , the CoMix initiative was an unprece - dented Europe - wide [ 2 ] effort consisting of multi - country social contact surveys in representative panels of individ - uals in terms of age , gender , region of residence , and for most countries either socio - economic status , occupation , or educational attainment . This work presents the results of a longitudinal survey of the Italian population in the scope of the CoMix initiative evaluating the impact on social contacts of physical distancing measures . As far as restriction measures are concerned , the case of Italy is especially interesting as the public health system is frag - mented in regional governments which are ultimately responsible for public - health - related decisions . During the COVID - 19 crisis , this led to the creation of a tiered regional system for the implementation of restrictive measures that corresponded to the introduction of color - coded “zones” . organized in progressively restrictive tiers ( color - coded as yellow , orange , and red ) imposed by the Italian government . The measures were implemented on a regional basis according to real - time epidemiological risk assessments [ 3 ] . By measuring epidemiologically rel - evant contact patterns ( proxied by the number of face - to - face conversations and physical contacts ) in the different regions over time this study aims to quantify the impact of these tiered restrictions on contacts and the COVID - 19 reproduction number . Methods Survey methodology Digital surveys were administrated to a panel of partici - pants ( representative of the general population ) aimed at determining changes in contact patterns in everyday life settings ( e . g . home , workplace , school , etc . ) . The sur - veys were conducted by the market research company Ipsos . Participants were recruited through email invita - tions to adult members of Ipsos online panels who could fill the survey for themselves or on behalf of children ( i . e . an individual aged less than 18 ) in their household . The surveys were submitted by participants every two weeks between the end of December 2020 and April 2021 , for a total of seven waves of data collection . The sample was representative of the Italian population by age , sex , geographical location , and socioeconomic status ( devia - tions of 5 % were allowed in each stratum ) . Furthermore , records of participants’ occupations , health status , and attitudes toward non - pharmaceutical intervention meas - ures and restrictions were also collected . Participants were also asked to specify whether they , their house - hold members or their contacts had tested positive for COVID - 19 at any point during the data collection and if this had led to self - isolation / quarantine . Participants were asked to record all contacts they had during the 24 hours before each survey . Participants were asked to provide information about the age , gender , physical con - tact , duration , and frequency of each contact as well as if physical contact occurred . Participants were also asked to record contact locations ( home , work , school , leisure activities , other places ) and specify whether the contact occurred outdoors or indoors . To allow for reporting a high number of contacts , participants were also asked to report contacts with a group . These group contacts were restricted to three possible locations ( work , school , oth - ers ) , to three age categories ( 0 - 18 , 19 - 65 , and 65 + years ) , and to be physical or not . Stratification by color‑code Participants were stratified by color code , i . e . according to the color assigned to their region of residence during the reporting period . Table 1 shows the criteria for the definition of the color codes and the corresponding inter - ventions [ 3 ] . The color of each region during each data collection wave is shown in SI ( Fig . 6 ) . We excluded the white zone from the analysis due to a lack of data . Contact Matrices Based on the information reported in the surveys , age - stratified contact matrices were calculated . Contact matrix elements were computed according to the follow - ing equation : where y ijt denotes the reported number of contacts expe - rienced by participant t of age i with someone of age j . T i denotes all participants of age i , and w it is the post - stratification weight . This accounts for possible under - and over - sampling of age categories or survey day type ( either weekday or weekend ) . When computing the con - tact matrix for a specific wave / zone we included only participants reporting contacts in that wave / zone and their corresponding contacts . We used the R library Socrates [ 2 , 4 ] , based on the socialmixr package , that includes population information from the Nation’s World Population Prospect [ 5 ] . To account for sampling vari - ability , we applied a bootstrapping procedure to the sam - ple with n = 10000 . When not available , the information about the age of the contacts was sampled out of the age m ij = T i t = 1 w it y ijt T i t = 1 w it Page 3 of 11 Tizzani et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 distribution of the reported individual contacts . Missing contact ages were sampled from the reported age groups . The pre - pandemic baseline was defined by the POLY - MOD dataset for Italy [ 6 ] . Contact settings were defined using the following possibilities : ( i ) home , i . e . , whether the contact occurred inside a house , not necessarily cor - responding to the participant’s household , ( ii ) workplace contacts , and ( iii ) other , i . e . , all contacts occurred in none of the previous locations . In the latter case , to compute the contact matrices , we considered only the contacts that the participants had in specific settings . In particu - lar , the matrix element for a given setting S is given by : where y Sijt is the number of contacts of the participant t of age i with someone of age j in the setting S . Finally , we averaged all the bootstrap iterations and considered the mean value for each matrix element . Reproduction number R 0 can be estimated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next - generation matrix using the social contact m Sij = (cid:31) T i t = 1 w it y Sijt (cid:31) T i t = 1 w it hypothesis [ 7 ] which states that the next - generation matrix is proportional to the contact matrix . In this case , the number of infectious contacts is propor - tional to the number of social contacts through an age - dependent factor q i , and thus , the next - generation matrix can be derived from the contact matrix . The pre - pandemic baseline for contacts was defined by the POLYMOD contact matrices for Italy . The relative reduction of R 0 can thus be determined as the rela - tive reduction in the largest eigenvalue of the contact matrix given by where R 0 ref is the value of R 0 before COVID - 19 restric - tions ( we used 2 . 96 with sd 0 . 11 [ 8 ] ) , ρ ( qM ) and ρ ( qM P ) are the spectral radius of the next generation matrices of the CoMix data ( possibly restricted to a given wave or zone ) and the POLYMOD data . Symmetric contact matrices were assumed . Any difference in the transmis - sion of the virus among different age groups is assumed to be negligible , i . e . it was assumed that q was not age dependent , which means that ρ ( qM ) = q ρ ( M ) and a simplified version of the formula above is obtained . R 0 = R 0 ref R 0 ratio = R 0 ref ρ ( qM ) ρ ( qM P ) Table 1 NPIs conditions .

Finally , to assess the differences between different zones , we compared the distribution of R 0 calculated from the bootstrap sample ( n = 10000 ) of contact matri - ces for each zone .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 wave 1 and declined to 591 in wave 7 . The two waves tar - geted at children recorded ≈ 300 responses . Good rep - resentativity of the Italian population in terms of age , sex , and geographical location ( reported separately in Table 1 in SI ) is observed , with small wave - to - wave vari - ations . The distribution of participants according to age groups , household sizes , and sex in the different zones is shown in Table 4 ( a ) . The largest number of participants is observed when yellow - coded restrictions are in place ( 3141 ) , with the number of participants when orange - and red - coded restrictions are in place amounting to 2228 and 1646 , respectively . Participants in white - coded regions are 39 and are therefore excluded from the analy - sis . The average age of the participants was 49 . 3 ( stand - ard deviation sd = 16 . 4 , max = 93 ) , with a median of 49 years , an interquartile range of [ 36 − 64 ] . The majority of the participants were male ( 53 . 3 % ) . Most of the par - ticipants did not live alone ( 98 . 2 % ) . The most common household arrangement was two adults without children ( 24 . 6 % ) . The predominant employment statuses were employed full - time ( 25 . 4 % ) or retired ( 27 . 8 % ) . Contact patterns and the impact of restrictions Contacts were stratified by age group , sex , waves , and household size . The descriptive comparison between CoMix survey and POLYMOD with respect to these cat - egories is shown in Table 3 . Figure 1 shows the average number of contacts for CoMix and POLYMOD for each age group in several settings . The differences between the two data sets are quite evident in all the settings even though the gap is less strong for home settings . Figure 2 compares the overall age - stratified contact matrices obtained by CoMix with those obtained for POLYMOD . Notably , while during the pre - pandemic period , most contacts happened between the same age classes ( thus confirming the assortative mixing of individuals [ 6 ] ) , this Fig . 3 ( a ) Average number of contacts by wave ( adults ) .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 is not entirely true for the contact matrix in the pandemic time where off - diagonal values are more heterogeneous with respect to the pre - pandemic period . In particular , the average number of contacts with the elderly during the pandemic is homogeneously distributed between the age groups of the participants and is generally higher than with other classes . The contact matrices for differ - ent waves , zones , and settings can be found in Figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 of the SI respectively . Figure 3a shows how , for each age group , the average number of contacts changed over time . There was a decline in reported contacts in each age group over the period of study . Figure 4 shows how aver - age reported contact rates vary according to restriction tires . Reported contact rates were higher in the yellow zone for both the orange and red zones , which had sig - nificantly stricter measures , as described in Table 4 ( b ) . While more contacts were reported in the yellow zone consistently across all age groups , the difference shows an age - specific effect . The largest difference in the number of contacts is reported for children aged 0 - 17 between the yellow and orange zone and is determined by the large difference in contacts at school reported ( Fig . 4 ) . Con - tacts at home , do not show appreciable differences across the three different zones , with the exception of children aged 0 - 17 reporting more contacts in the red zone than in yellow or orange zones . Contacts at “other” locations present the largest difference between zones , the more so the younger the participant . Overall , a higher number of contacts was reported during the first wave of data col - lection for all age groups , except for the 60 + class , com - pared to the last wave of reporting . The average number of contacts was heterogeneous across the age groups for all waves . In particular , and regardless of the wave of data collection , elderly participants ( 60 + ) reported a lower number of contacts than other age classes , with a dis - tribution showing less heterogeneity than the other age classes . The most relevant differences for this age group are for work contacts , with a markedly lower number than the other age classes , consistent with the fact that a considerable fraction of this group consists of retired people . Furthermore , the measured contact patterns are not symmetric with respect to age classes . In particular , Fig . 4 Average number of contacts by zones . Average number of contacts broken down by age and zone for contacts reported at all locations ( ALL ) , at home ( HOME ) , at other locations ( OTHER ) , at school ( SCHOOL ) , and at work ( WORK ) . Point values correspond to the average value , while the error bars mark the sd . The color code indicates the NPIs , yellow for the lowest stringency regime , while red for the highest Page 8 of 11 Tizzani et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 elders were more being contacted by other participants than reaching out to them . This might be caused by the household structures consisting of elders living with their families . Finally , the impact of restrictions on the severity of the epidemic , measured by the change in the colored zones of the reproduction number R 0 is shown in Fig . 5 . It can be seen that R 0 is significantly lower for the red and orange zones compared to the yellow zone , which had the least restrictive set of interventions . Statistical test - ing confirms that the difference is statistically significant ( KS test , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Similarly , the difference between the orange and red zones is also significant ( KS test , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The impact of the dependency in q is shown in SI ( Fig . 4 SI ) . Results consistently show a decrease in R 0 when computed for the yellow , orange , and red zones . Discussion The pandemic strongly affected contact patterns among the population , as restrictions in most countries tried to reduce social mixing and mitigate the spreading of the COVID - 19 epidemic . The CoMix initiative was aimed at quantifying this unprecedented change in social behav - ior with a Europe - wide effort based on contact surveys administered to representative panels in 19 European countries [ 2 ] . Results have shown how in countries such as the UK [ 11 ] , Belgium [ 12 ] and the Netherlands [ 13 ] , the CoMix initiative was capable of capturing the evo - lution of contact patterns across the various phases of an ever - changing pandemic . This was the case also for Italy , as detailed by the contact patterns across different age groups and in different settings across various sets of restrictions . To face the unfolding of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the Italian government developed progres - sively restrictive tiers ( coded as yellow , orange , and red ) imposed on a regional basis according to real - time epide - miological risk assessments , based on several indicators [ 3 ] . The results show a significant impact in terms of the reduction of social mixing with stricter tiered measures . In particular , the differences were stronger between the yellow and the other two zones , and while more con - tacts were reported in the yellow zone independently of the age group , the difference between the red and orange zones is larger for children aged 5 - 17 and middle - aged population . In particular , the large reduction in con - tacts for children ( i . e . 0 - 17 ) between yellow and orange / red zones is driven by the number of contacts at school . Although the policy of school closing is implemented at the regional level ( no variation between the same color code is possible ) , our result shows an overall effect in school contacts depending on the color - code restric - tions . In - house contacts , however , are similar across the different zones consistently with the fact that home vis - its were at least partially allowed even in the red zone . The only , and notable , exception here are the contacts at home of children aged 5 - 17 , which increase from orange to red zone . This is consistent with the closure of middle schools , which leads children to stay at home under the supervision of an adult , hence increasing their contacts at home . Other studies in Europe [ 12 – 15 ] and world - wide [ 16 , 17 ] have reported a similar reduction in the number of contacts during COVID - 19 social distancing , Table 4 Distribution of participants and contacts by zone , age group , gender , household size Zone Orange Red Yellow ( a ) Total number of participants and percentage All participants 2228 1646 3141 Age group 0 - 4 58 ( 2 % ) 51 ( 3 % ) 52 ( 2 % ) 5 - 17 165 ( 7 % ) 123 ( 7 % ) 145 ( 4 % ) 18 - 29 349 ( 16 % ) 281 ( 17 % ) 429 ( 14 % ) 30 - 39 277 ( 12 % ) 242 ( 15 % ) 424 ( 14 % ) 40 - 49 476 ( 21 % ) 352 ( 21 % ) 704 ( 22 % ) 50 - 59 362 ( 16 % ) 226 ( 14 % ) 512 ( 16 % ) 60 + 764 ( 34 % ) 545 ( 33 % ) 1072 ( 34 % ) Gender F 1286 ( 52 % ) 956 ( 52 % ) 1622 ( 49 % ) M 1169 ( 48 % ) 865 ( 48 % ) 1710 ( 51 % ) HH size 1 309 ( 14 % ) 191 ( 12 % ) 374 ( 12 % ) 2 758 ( 31 % ) 532 ( 29 % ) 1047 ( 31 % ) 3 - 5 1243 ( 51 % ) 994 ( 55 % ) 1729 ( 52 % ) 5 + 147 ( 6 % ) 105 ( 6 % ) 188 ( 6 % ) ( b ) Average number of contacts and IQR All contacts 2 . 93 ( 1 - 3 ) 2 . 58 ( 1 - 3 ) 3 . 56 ( 1 - 4 ) Age group 0 - 4 6 . 33 ( 2 - 7 ) 4 . 32 ( 2 - 4 ) 8 . 77 ( 3 - 9 ) 5 - 17 5 . 82 ( 3 - 6 ) 3 . 5 ( 2 - 4 ) 10 . 91 ( 3 - 12 ) 18 - 29 3 . 23 ( 1 - 4 ) 3 . 26 ( 1 - 3 ) 4 . 62 ( 2 - 4 ) 30 - 39 2 . 79 ( 1 - 3 ) 2 . 45 ( 1 - 3 ) 4 . 17 ( 1 - 4 ) 40 - 49 3 . 61 ( 1 - 4 ) 2 . 76 ( 1 - 3 ) 3 . 98 ( 1 - 4 ) 50 - 59 3 . 72 ( 1 - 4 ) 3 . 62 ( 1 - 3 ) 4 . 12 ( 1 - 4 ) 60 + 2 . 49 ( 1 - 3 ) 2 . 19 ( 1 - 3 ) 2 . 68 ( 1 - 3 ) Gender F 2 . 99 ( 1 - 3 ) 2 . 72 ( 1 - 3 ) 3 . 73 ( 1 - 4 ) M 3 . 16 ( 1 - 3 ) 2 . 74 ( 1 - 3 ) 3 . 63 ( 1 - 4 ) HH size 1 1 . 61 ( 1 - 1 ) 1 . 35 ( 1 - 1 ) 3 . 04 ( 1 - 2 ) 2 2 . 32 ( 1 - 2 ) 2 . 11 ( 1 - 2 ) 3 . 02 ( 1 - 3 ) 3 - 5 3 . 86 ( 2 - 4 ) 3 . 19 ( 2 - 3 ) 4 . 14 ( 2 - 4 ) 5 + 4 . 82 ( 4 - 5 ) 5 . 17 ( 3 - 5 ) 4 . 82 ( 4 - 6 ) Page 9 of 11 Tizzani et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 in particular highlighting the reduction in non - household contacts . Specifically , the number of contacts measured in red zones is comparable to the 2 - 5 average contacts per day reported during an earlier phase of the pan - demic , when stay - at - home mandates were in place [ 17 ] . The impact of restrictions on contact patterns and there - fore on the spread of COVID - 19 is also confirmed by the analysis of R0 . Based on the social contact hypothesis , considering POLYMOD contact data as the baseline for pre - pandemic contacts and an R0 of 2 . 96 ( 2 . 73 - 3 . 17 95 % CI ) [ 8 ] , we were able to link the reduction in contact pat - terns to a value of R0 . We obtained average values of R0 that are lower than 1 for every color - code of interven - tions ( Fig . 5 ) , however with confidence interval including one for the yellow zone . Results from linear mixed model informed by mobility data [ 18 ] report comparable reduc - tions in the reproduction number , confirming the efficacy of the tiered system . The additional insight that our study provides is the location and age - specific contribution to the reduction , with contacts of working adults at work and of children at school responsible for the large reduc - tion in R0 between yellow and orange zones . In fact , more stringent intervention measures further reduce the reproduction number . Unfortunately , we did not collect enough data to estimate the reduction of R0 for white zones . Our results show that these restrictions , adopted during Winter 2020 and Spring 2021 , have contributed to drastically reducing the reproduction number . The limi - tations of this work are discussed in the following . First , the least strict level of intervention was excluded from the analysis , since only a few participants in the data collection were in the white zone . As the epidemiologi - cal conditions were quite severe , almost no region in Italy had the epidemiological indicators to be classified as a white zone . Thus , it was not possible to quantify sponta - neous changes in contact patterns when limited or mild restrictions were implemented . Also , minor changes in the definition of the zones took place during our collec - tion period , and some restrictions were different at the regional level ( e . g . school closure was not implemented according to the same criteria for all the regions ) . How - ever , we expect that these differences will matter to a lim - ited extent since the core of the intervention scheme was well established . Lastly , we neglected in our analysis the longitudinal nature of the data . While this would allow us to take into account heterogeneity at the individual level ( see for example [ 19 ] ) it would require considering additional effects ( e . g . the fatigue associated with repeated surveys ) that are not fully understood [ 15 , 20 ] and we , therefore , leave this for future research . Additionally , in terms of implications for policymakers , our work hasn’t taken into account the assessment of cooperation for example between public and occupational health stakeholders to prevent the effects of COVID - 19 pandemic which has been analyzed more in - depth in other works [ 21 , 22 ] . Conclusion NPIs reduced the number of contacts independently by age group and contact settings . All the interven - tions considered played an essential role to withstand Fig . 5 Reproduction number . Reproduction number computed for each zone .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 906 the pandemic and were able to reduce R 0 below one , with stronger measures leading to a greater reduction of R 0 . As the spread of COVID - 19 evolves due to vac - cination campaigns and new variants of concerns , con - tinuous monitoring of social contact data can provide invaluable information to quantify the impact of social distancing policies and promptly design effective strat - egies to reduce the impact of the pandemic .
