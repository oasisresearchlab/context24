Here we compare the enhancer landscape , transcriptional factor occupancy , and transcriptomic changes in human fetal and adult hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells and committed erythroid progenitors . We ﬁnd that enhancers are modulated pervasively and direct lineage - and stage - speciﬁctranscription . GATA2 - to - GATA1switch is prevalent at dynamic enhancers and drives erythroid enhancer commissioning . Examination of lineage - speciﬁc enhancers identiﬁes transcription factors and their combinatorial patterns in enhancer turnover . Importantly , by CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genomic editing , we uncover functional hierarchy of constituent enhancers within the SLC25A37 su - per - enhancer . Despite indistinguishable chromatin features , we reveal through genomic editing the func - tional diversity of several GATA switch enhancers in which enhancers with opposing functions coop - erate to coordinate transcription . Thus , genome - wide enhancer proﬁling coupled with in situ enhancer editing provide critical insights into the functional complexity of enhancers during development . INTRODUCTION Stem cell self - renewal and differentiation require precisely regu - lated tissue - speciﬁc and developmental stage - speciﬁc gene expression . Enhancers are cis - acting DNA sequences that can increase the transcription of genes through cooperative and syn - ergistic binding of transcription factors ( TFs ) , DNA binding effec - tors of signaling pathways , and chromatin - modifying complexes ( Banerji et al . , 1981 ) . Enhancers function from distal regions in an orientation - independent manner , and harbor distinct chromatin features including increased chromatin accessibility , character - istic histone modiﬁcations and DNA hypomethylation , and bidi - rectional transcription ( Bulger and Groudine , 2011 ) . Although major progress has been made toward genome - wide annotation of candidate enhancers ( Andersson et al . , 2014 ; Heintzman et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; Visel et al . , 2009a ) , the molecular processes controlling enhancer activation and deactivation during lineage commitment remain poorly understood . A deﬁning feature of enhancers is their ability to function as integrated platforms for TF binding , where cell - intrinsic and - extrinsic signaling cues are interpreted in a highly lineage - and context - dependent manner ( Buecker and Wysocka , 2012 ) . Despite recent advances in proﬁling enhancer - associated biochemical features , the biological importance of individual enhancers in lineage differentiation is often limited by lack of insights in enhancer regulation in vivo and in molecular details of enhancer structure - function in situ . The fundamental ques - tions related to enhancer function and mechanisms remain un - answered : how do enhancers regulate precise spatiotemporal gene expression patterns ? How are enhancers organized and regulated in a high - dimensional chromatin environment ? How do enhancers communicate with their target genes in vivo during development ? Furthermore , how do mutations and genetic var - iations in enhancers inﬂuence human disease ? Recently , intensely marked clusters of enhancers or super - en - hancers containing an exceptionally high degree of enrichment of master TFs , Mediator , and chromatin marks have been iden - tiﬁed in a broad range of mammalian cell types ( Hnisz et al . , 2013 ; Parker et al . , 2013 ; Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Super - enhancers Developmental Cell 36 , 9 – 23 , January 11 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 9 differ from regular enhancers in both the size and intensity of the associated chromatin features , and are frequently found in genomic proximity of cell identity genes and disease - associated variants . Super - enhancers are also found at key oncogenic drivers , thus selective inhibition of oncogenes may be achieved by disruption of super - enhancers ( Loven et al . , 2013 ) . These studies suggested a model that a relatively small set of line - age - deﬁning super - enhancers might determine cell identity in development and disease . Despite the proposed prominent roles , the regulatory components and functional features associ - ated with super - enhancers are currently unknown . The critical questions are whether the super - enhancer represents a single functional unit in vivo , and how the individual constituent en - hancers contribute to maximal enhancer activity through coop - erativity or interaction within their native chromatin environment ( Pott and Lieb , 2015 ) . We reasoned that modeling human fetal and adult - stage erythropoiesis combined with epigenomic enhancer annotation and analysis of the underlying DNA sequences can be used as an unbiased approach to identify causative TFs driving enhancer temporal activities in lineage speciﬁcation . Comparing and con - trasting TF binding associated with developmentally regulated enhancers facilitates identiﬁcation of lineage - regulating factors and their combinatorial rules as putative drivers of enhancer turnover during differentiation . GATA2 - to - GATA1 switch is a crit - ical molecular driver of developmentally dynamic enhancers dur - ing erythroid speciﬁcation . Most importantly , through CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated loss - of - function analysis , we uncover functional hierarchy and complexity of constituent enhancers within the same enhancer clusters . Thus , genome - wide enhancer proﬁling coupled with in - depth enhancer editing provides important insights into the regulatory components controlling enhancer functions during erythropoiesis . RESULTS Pervasive Changes in Enhancer Landscape during Human Erythropoiesis Primary fetal - and adult - stage human CD34 + hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) were expanded and differentiated ex vivo into highly enriched stage - matched populations of erythroid progenitor cells ( proerythroblasts or ProEs ) ( Figure 1A ) .

Comparative analysis of the enhancer landscape illustrates pervasive temporal changes in enhancer usage underlying lineage and developmental stage speciﬁcity . For example , 8 , 632 enhancers are lost ( A0 - A5 - lost ) and 8 , 496 enhancers are acquired ( A0 - A5 - gained ) upon differentiation of adult HSPCs ( A0 ) to ProEs ( A5 ) , whereas only 3 , 996 enhancers are preserved ( A0 - A5 - shared , Figures 1B and 1C ) . The number of developmen - tally dynamic enhancers is much higher than that of differentially expressed genes ( Figure S1B ) , suggesting that the enhancer landscape undergoes more extensive turnover than transcrip - tomic changes during lineage speciﬁcation . Furthermore , we identiﬁed 1 , 916 to 2 , 856 enhancers uniquely active at fetal or adult stage in HSPCs or ProEs , indicating a substantial change in genome - wide regulatory architecture across developmental stages within the erythroid lineage ( Figure 1B ) . During the transi - tion from HSPCs to ProEs , lost enhancers at both fetal and adult stages are signiﬁcantly enriched in recognition sites ( or motifs ) for HSPC - regulating TFs including ETS1 , ERG , FLI1 , and PU . 1 ( Orkin and Zon , 2008 ; Wilson et al . , 2010 ) , whereas gained en - hancers are enriched in motifs for erythroid master regulators GATA1 and TAL1 ( Cantor and Orkin , 2002 ) ( Figure 1F ) . By contrast , the comparison between fetal and adult stage - speciﬁc enhancers reveals enrichment of distinct TF motifs ( Figure 1G ) . Of note , the most enriched motifs in F5 - A5 - gained enhancers are IRF1 , IRF2 , and STAT1 / 2 , consistent with recent studies demonstrating a role of inﬂammatory signaling pathways in es - tablishing HSPC programs ( Espin - Palazon et al . , 2014 ; He et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) . Taken together , these results indicate that the lineage - deﬁning TFs are functionally conserved within enhancers during lineage speciﬁcation ; how - ever , they cooperate with distinct stage - speciﬁc cofactors to modulate enhancer landscape for fetal and adult erythropoiesis . Enhancers Control Lineage and Stage - Speciﬁc Transcription To directly examine the correlation between enhancer activities and lineage or developmental stage - speciﬁc gene expression , we mapped enhancers to target genes using the ‘‘nearest neighbor gene’’ approach ( Heintzman et al . , 2009 ; Visel et al . , 2009a ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) and compared these with lineage or stage - speciﬁc gene expression ( Figure 2A and Table S3 ) . Impor - tantly , the erythroid lineage - speciﬁc enhancers ( F0 - F5 - gained and A0 - A5 - gained ) strongly associate with genes induced during erythropoiesis ( F0 - F5 - up and A0 - A5 - up ) , whereas the HSPC - associated enhancers ( F0 - F5 - lost and A0 - A5 - lost ) strongly associate with downregulated genes ( F0 - F5 - down and A0 - A5 - down ) . Similarly , the presence of stage - speciﬁc enhancers highly correlates with gene expression changes in the respective fetal or adult stage ( Figure 2A ) . Of note , by focusing on representative A0 - A5 - up genes , we observed that genes with an increasing number of enhancers display faster expression kinetics and higher mRNA levels during differentiation ( Figure 2B ) . We then compared on a global scale the expression kinetics of genes associated with single and mul - tiple lost or gained lineage - speciﬁc enhancers ( Figure 2C ) . These analyses demonstrate that an increasing number of enhancers strongly correlate with more rapid kinetics and pronounced transcriptional changes . It has been suggested that clustered enhancers , including super - enhancers , associate with critical developmental or cancer - associated transcription units ( Hnisz et al . , 2013 ; Loven et al . , 2013 ; Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with this notion , we observed that the lineage - speciﬁc super - enhancers correlate with more robust transcriptional changes than regular enhancers ( Figure 2D ) . Enhancers can act from distance to regulate transcription . We then compared the expression of genes targeted by enhancers located at varying distance ( Figure 2E ) . Interestingly , the prox - imal enhancers correlate with more rapid kinetics and larger quantitative changes in gene expression compared with distal enhancers . Taken together , these analyses illustrate critical roles of enhancers in modulating lineage - and stage - speciﬁc gene expression patterns , and suggest that the quantity and physical proximity of enhancers can inﬂuence the transcriptional robust - ness of their gene targets during development . In Situ Genomic Editing of the SLC25A37 Super - enhancer Intensely marked enhancer clusters or super - enhancers , con - sisting of multiple discrete enhancers spanning larger chromatin domains , have been proposed to control genes essential for cell identity . The enhancer cluster upstream of the SLC25A37 gene , consisting of three distinct constituent enhancers as measured by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIP - seq , is deﬁned as an erythroid - speciﬁc super - enhancer in both human ( A5 ProE ) and mouse ( G1ER ) erythroid cells ( Figure 3A and Table S4 ) . The orthologous mouse super - enhancer displays high primary sequence homology , syntenic position , and similar chromatin signature and TF occupancy ( Figure 3A ) . The SLC25A37 gene encodes Mitoferrin 1 that functions as an essential mitochondrial importer for iron metabolism and heme biogenesis . A genetic deﬁciency of SLC25A37 results in profound hypochromic ane - mia in vertebrate species ( Amigo et al . , 2011 ; Shaw et al . , 2006 ) . The expression of SLC25A37 , but not the neighboring ENTPD4 gene , is progressively and signiﬁcantly induced during human and mouse erythropoiesis ( Figures S2A and 3C ) , sug - gesting that it is trans - activated through the upstream super - enhancer . To deﬁne the regulatory components of the SLC25A37 super - enhancer , we asked whether the function of each constituent enhancer depends on the activity of neighboring enhancers in situ . We employed site - directed loss - of - function analysis of the SLC25A37 super - enhancer constituents using CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genomic engineering . We focused on the or - thologous mouse super - enhancer in the murine G1E / G1ER erythroid cell model ( Welch et al . , 2004 ) . Analogous to the ex vivo erythroid maturation of human HSPCs , the Gata1 - null G1E cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state and ex - press a high level of Gata2 . Upon activation of the Gata1 - ER transgene by b - estradiol treatment in G1ER cells , Gata1 mRNA was progressively elevated whereas Gata2 expression was sharply downregulated , resulting in a ‘‘GATA switch’’ ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . We designed sequence - speciﬁc single - guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) ﬂanking each constituent enhancer ( E1 , E2 , and E3 ) or the Developmental Cell 36 , 9 – 23 , January 11 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 11 promoter ( P ) ( Figure 3B ) . Upon transfection into undifferentiated G1E cells together with an SpCas9 - expressing construct , we screened and obtained multiple independent single - cell - derived clones containing biallelic deletion of each enhancer ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . Surprisingly , knockout of individual enhancers confers markedly varying effects on Slc25a37 expression . Speciﬁcally , while deletion of E1 or E2 individually only modestly or slightly impairs Slc25a37 activation during differentiation , respectively , E3 deletion abolishes its activation , resulting in a 15 - fold decrease in expression ( 48 hr after b - estradiol treatment ; Figure 3C ) . The expression of the neighboring Entpd4 gene remains low and unchanged in control and enhancer - deletion cells ( Figure S2D ) . ChIP - seq analysis of CTCF reveals two CTCF binding sites between Slc25a37 and Entpd4 genes ( Figure S2E ) , suggesting that the Slc25a37 super - enhancer does not control Entpd4 transcription in erythroid cells . The dif - ferentiation kinetics of G1E cells , as measured by Gata1 and Gata2 expression , appear ostensibly normal in the absence of Slc25a37 enhancers ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Of note , by using combinations of sgRNAs , we also ob - tained G1E cells containing deletion of multiple constituent enhancers ( Figures 3B , S3C , and S3D ) . Consistent with a prominent role of E3 in super - enhancer activation , combined deletion of E2 and E3 ( E2 - 3 ) or all three enhancers ( E1 - 3 ) completely abolishes Slc25a37 expression upon differentia - tion ( Figure 3C ) . Importantly , deletion of individual or multiple constituent enhancers has only a subtle effect on Slc25a37 baseline expression in G1E cells ( Figures 3C , S3C , and S3D ) , indicating that enhancer usage is highly context spe - ciﬁc . Loss of E3 leads to near absence of H3K27ac , GATA1 and TAL1 occupancy at the neighboring E1 and E2 enhancers , whereas loss of E1 or E2 has minimal impact on H3K27ac or GATA1 / TAL1 binding at neighboring enhancers ( Figures 3D – 3G ) . These results strongly suggest that , despite the indistinguishable chromatin features and TF occupancy at the Slc25a37 constituent enhancers , the E3 enhancer is functionally more potent than its neighboring enhancers in directing transcriptional activation . Thus , our in - depth in situ enhancer - deletion analyses demonstrate that the Slc25a37 super - enhancer is composed of a functional hierarchy con - taining both critical and dispensable constituent components ( Figure 3H ) .

We reasoned that uncovering the functionally relevant TFs that asso - ciate with developmentally dynamic enhancers should help to infer lineage - speciﬁc regulators and their combinations in con - trolling cellular identity . To this end , we compared the motif enrichment and ChIP - seq occupancy of a panel of lineage - regu - lating TFs ( GATA1 , TAL1 , FLI1 , and PU . 1 ) and the ubiquitously expressed CTCF ( Figure 4A ) . Strikingly , while only 3 % ( 22 , 570 of 707 , 718 ) of the GATA1 motif - matched loci are covered by GATA1 ChIP - seq at a genome scale in ProEs , 34 % of identiﬁed GATA1 motifs are covered by GATA1 within the enhancer context . Furthermore , 55 % of GATA1 motifs at A0 - A5 - gained enhancers are occupied by GATA1 , in contrast to only 9 % in A0 - A5 - lost enhancers , consistent with a prominent role of GATA1 in erythroid speciﬁcation . A similar pattern is observed for another principal erythroid regulator , TAL1 ( Figure 4A ) . In stark contrast , the opposite patterns are observed for HSPC - regulating FLI1 and PU . 1 . Of note , comparable frequencies of CTCF motif - matched loci are covered by CTCF ChIP - seq in both cell types . These analyses demonstrate that functionally relevant TF motifs are highly enriched in lineage - selective en - hancers of lineage - relevant cell types . To comprehensively identify TFs involved in developmentally dynamic enhancers , we performed motif enrichment analysis and identiﬁed 86 TF motifs that are signiﬁcantly enriched in at least one enhancer type across 12 types of lineage or stage - speciﬁc enhancers ( Figures 4B and S4A ) . Speciﬁcally , GATA1 and GATA1 : TAL1 motifs are highly enriched in the erythroid - spe - ciﬁc F0 - F5 - gained and A0 - A5 - gained enhancers . In contrast , PU . 1 , RUNX1 , ETS1 , and FLI1 motifs are highly enriched in the HSPC - speciﬁc F0 - F5 - lost and A0 - A5 - lost enhancers . To validate the motif analysis , we performed 30 additional ChIP - seq analyses of identiﬁed TFs in both HSPCs and ProEs , including GATA1 , GATA2 , TAL1 , PU . 1 , and RUNX1 in HSPCs ( F0 and A0 ) and / or ProEs ( F5 and A5 ) ( Figures 4C , 5F , and Table S1 ) . We also re - analyzed 45 previously published ChIP - seq datasets of TFs and chromatin regulators obtained in the same cell populations ( Abraham et al . , 2013 ; Beck et al . , 2013 ; Dogan et al . , 2015 ; Su et al . , 2013 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) ( Table S1 ) . Consistent with the motif analysis , ChIP - seq of a panel of identi - ﬁed TFs clearly demonstrates enrichment of distinct TF clusters within each enhancer type ( Figures 4C and S4B ) . To explore the TF combinatorial rules , we determined the co - association between TFs within the enhancer repertoires ( Figure 4D ) . By hierarchical clustering analysis , we identiﬁed ﬁve distinct TF combinatorial modules , including expected asso - ciations such as GATA1 and TAL1 , and some less expected as - sociations such as NFE2 and MYB . Importantly , we found that the ubiquitous ‘‘housekeeping’’ E2F - SP1 and AP1 modules , and the HSPC - speciﬁc RUNX1 - FLI1 - PU . 1 - ETS module , are in - terconnected but dissociable , suggesting that distinct TF combi - nations cooperate to modulate the spatiotemporal activities of enhancers in a highly context - speciﬁc manner . Taken together , these analyses uncover TF combinatorial regulatory patterns with known and unknown roles as putative drivers of enhancer turnover during erythropoiesis . Enhancer - Centered TF Combinatorial Regulatory Networks Toillustrate thetemporal control ofenhancer activities , we devel - oped acomputational methodology todelineate enhancer - medi - atedtranscriptionalnetworksbyconnectingmotifenrichment , TF occupancy , and enhancer activity ( Figure 5A ) . In brief , to quantify the relative importance of individual TF on enhancer speciﬁcity , we calculated the enrichment score as the signiﬁcance of the enrichment of TF ChIP - seq peaks ( or motif - matched loci ) within each type of lineage or stage - speciﬁc enhancers using the whole genome as background . To quantify the likelihood of TF cooper - ation , we calculated the combinational score as the frequency of co - occurrence of two TFs at the same enhancer relative to genomebackground . WethenselectedTF / motifpairswithsignif - icant combinational scores to assemble the networks for each enhancer type in Cytoscape ( Shannon et al . , 2003 ) . Notably , the A0 - A5 - lost network is predominantly modulated by the PU . 1 - RUNX1 - FLI1 - ETS - GATA2 combinatorial interac - tions . In contrast , the A0 - A5 - gained network is dominated by GATA1 - TAL1 together with an IRF2 - STAT1 - STAT2 interaction module , suggesting that the temporal changes in TF occupancy control differential enhancer activity ( Figure 5B ) . Distinct sets of TF combinatorial modules were found at lineage or stage - speciﬁc enhancers ( Figure S5 and Table S5 ) . Importantly , the Figure 3 .

GATA2 and GATA1 combinatorial interactions are present in both A0 and A5 networks , with GATA2 dominating the A0 network while GATA1 dominates the A5 network ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , our data suggest that the combinatorial assembly of lineage - deﬁning TFs and transcriptional coregulators at lineage - and stage - speciﬁc enhancers directs temporal regulation of transcriptional networks during erythroid speciﬁcation . To validate the network predictions , we ﬁrst compared the network - identiﬁed interactions with known protein - protein inter - actions ( PPIs ) from Lit - BM - 13 ( Rolland et al . , 2014 ) and STRING ( Szklarczyk et al . , 2015 ) databases . We observed that the network - predicted TF interactions are 7 . 3 - and 3 . 8 - fold more enriched of known PPIs in Lit - BM - 13 and STRING databases , respectively , compared with random interactions ( p values 8 . 0 3 10 (cid:1) 33 and 1 . 9 3 10 (cid:1) 66 by Fisher’s exact test ; Figure 5C ) . We then investigated the extent to which disease - associated SNPs occur in enhancers containing network - predicted TF pairs ( Figure 5D ) . We observed that enhancers containing network - predicted TF interactions ( TF pairs in network ; Figure 5D ) are highly enriched in GWAS SNPs , particularly the hematologic anderythroidtrait - associatedSNPs . Furthermore , A0 - A5 - gained erythroid - speciﬁc enhancers are more signiﬁcantly enriched in erythroid SNPs than A0 - A5 - lost HSPC - speciﬁc enhancers ( Fig - ure 5E ) . These analyses conﬁrm that the enhancer - centered TF combinatorial networks can be used to identify functionally rele - vant and disease - associated regulatory interactions .

In addition , we generated ChIP - seq density heatmaps within the lost , shared , and gained enhancers in HSPCs ( A0 ) and ProEs ( A5 ) . Strikingly , while the HSPC - regulating TFs ( FLI1 and PU . 1 ) , p300 , and BRG1 exclusively associate with HSPC - speciﬁc ( A0 - A5 - lost ) and shared enhancers , GATA2 can occupy a subset of erythroid - speciﬁc ( A0 - A5 - gained ) enhancers prior to their acti - vation ( Figure 5F ) . A signiﬁcant portion of A0 - A5 - gained ( 17 % ) and - shared ( 30 % ) enhancers display GATA2 - to - GATA1 switch . These results , together with the network analysis , strongly sug - gest that GATA switch plays a major role in modulating enhancer turnover during erythroid speciﬁcation . GATA2 - to - GATA1 Switch Functions as a Molecular Driver of Enhancer Turnover To further dissect the molecular processes controlling enhancer turnover , we focused on enhancers that are lost or gained be - tween adult HSPCs ( A0 ) and ProE ( A5 ) . Speciﬁcally , we subdi - vided A0 - A5 - lost enhancers into two groups depending on whether they have lost H3K27ac ( ‘‘active / primed’’ ) , or both H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ( ‘‘active / silent’’ ) ( Figure S6A ) . Simi - larly , we subdivided A0 - A5 - gained enhancers into two groups depending on the prior chromatin states in HSPCs ( ‘‘silent / active’’ and ‘‘primed / active’’ ) . Notably , the active / silent en - hancers are highly enriched for TF motifs required for HSPC identity such as RUNX1 , PU . 1 , FLI1 , and ETS1 . In contrast , the silent / active enhancers are highly enriched for GATA1 and TAL1 motifs . We next examined the occupancy of various line - age - speciﬁc TFs and chromatin regulators at the enhancer groups . Strikingly , GATA2 - to - GATA1 switch ( or GATA switch ) is highly prevalent within transcriptionally primed enhancers , consisting of 30 % of active / primed lost enhancers and 41 % of the primed / active gained enhancers ( Figure S6B ) . By network ( Figure S6C ) and motif analysis ( Figure S6D ) , we also identiﬁed GATA switch as the major TF combinatorial module in primed enhancers . These data strongly suggest that GATA switch functions as a major molecular driver of enhancer turn - over during erythropoiesis . Genomic Features of GATA Switch Enhancers To further dissect the role of GATA switch in enhancer turnover , we compared GATA2 and GATA1 occupancy within A0 and A5 enhancers by ChIP - seq . Speciﬁcally , we enumerated the distri - bution of enhancers occupied by GATA2 - only , GATA1 - only , or GATA2 - to - GATA1 switch ( GATA switch ) ( Figure 6A and Table S6 ) . By overlap analysis , we identiﬁed 3 , 101 GATA switch en - hancers and the remainder as GATA2 - only ( 2 , 697 ) or GATA1 - only ( 4 , 348 ) enhancers , respectively . Importantly , the GATA switch enhancers consist of 39 % of A0 - A5 - shared and 47 % of A0 - A5 - gained enhancers , and only 14 % of A0 - A5 - lost en - hancers , consistent with the role of GATA switch as a major driver for enhancer activation . We then examined the differentially enriched TF motifs within GATA switch and GATA1 / 2 - only ( or non - switch ) enhancers . We found that GATA motifs are highly enriched in GATA switch and GATA1 - only enhancers , but not in GATA2 - only enhancers . By contrast , the GATA2 - only enhancers are highly enriched with TF motifs known to be important for HSPC identity ( Fig - ure 6B ) . These analyses indicate that the recruitment of GATA factors within the GATA switch enhancers are mediated primarily through GATA motifs ( motif - driven ) . However , GATA2 binding to the non - switch GATA2 - only enhancers are mediated largely through transcriptional cofactors ( cofactor - driven ) . We then compared the mRNA expression of genes targeted by GATA2 - only , GATA switch , or GATA1 - only enhancers . The GATA2 - only targets are progressively downregulated , whereas the GATA1 - only targets are progressively upregulated during erythropoiesis . Interestingly , the expression levels of GATA switch enhancer targets are much higher than that of genomic average , and remain largely unchanged during differentiation ( Figure 6C ) . These results suggest that , on the global scale , GATA switch en - hancers function to maintain the high level of gene expression critical for cellular differentiation and housekeeping functions , in contrast to GATA1 - only or GATA2 - only enhancers ( Figure 6D ) . In Situ Genomic Editing of GATA Switch Enhancers in Lineage Differentiation To gain functional insights into the role of GATA switch in regu - lating enhancer activities , we employed CRISPR / Cas9 - medi - ated genomic editing to remove GATA switch or non - switch enhancers at multiple independent loci in G1E cells ( Figures 7 and S7 ) . Strikingly , loss of GATA switch and non - switch en - hancers results in pleiotropic effects on target gene expression during erythroid differentiation . At the Pinx1 gene , biallelic dele - tion of the GATA2 - only enhancer ( E1 ) markedly impairs Pinx1 Figure 5 .

In contrast , deletion of the GATA switch enhancer ( E2 ) signiﬁcantly and selectively impairs Pinx1 expression during late differentiation . The differentiation kinetics of G1E cells remain ostensibly normal in the absence of Pinx1 enhancers ( Fig - ures S7A – S7D ) . Similarly , biallelic deletion of the Mrto4 GATA2 - only enhancer ( E1 ) impairs baseline Mrto4 expression , whereas deletion of the GATA switch enhancer ( E2 ) selectively diminishes Mrto4 expression upon differentiation ( Figures 7B , 7D , 7E , and S7E – S7H ) . The distinct effects upon loss of GATA2 - only versus GATA switch enhancers strongly suggest that multiple spatially or temporally distinct enhancers cooperate to control the optimal expression of target genes . We then employed genomic editing to dissect the requirement of GATA switch enhancers within the paradigmatic Gata2 locus ( Bresnick et al . , 2010 ; Dore et al . , 2012 ; Kaneko et al . , 2010 ) . Gata2 is a potent regulator of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells and is highly expressed in HSPCs , then rapidly silenced in erythroid cells ( Bresnick et al . , 2010 ; Tsai et al . , 1994 ) ( Figure 7H ) . The transcription of Gata2 gene is controlled by multiple distal regulatory elements including an enhancer cluster immediately upstream of the Gata2 transcriptional start site ( TSS ) ( E1 , E2 , and E3 ; Figures 7F and 7G ) . The upstream enhancers display indistinguishable chromatin features , such as the enrichment of histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac , and occupancy by GATA2 in HSPCs ( or G1E ) and GATA1 in ProEs ( or G1ER ) , respectively ( Figure 7F ) . Surprisingly , deletion of E1 has no effect on Gata2 expression in G1E and during early differentiation , but Gata2 expression is markedly induced during late differentiation ( Figures 7G and 7H ) . In contrast , deletion of E2 or E3 signiﬁcantly impairs Gata2 expression in G1E , with minimal effects on its expression upon differentiation . Of note , these ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies using engineered mouse models lacking critical GATA motifs at the Gata2 upstream en - hancers . In mice lacking a single palindromic GATA motif 1 . 8 kb upstream of the Gata2 TSS , which overlaps with the E1 enhancer , Gata2 expression is reactivated in late - stage erythro - blasts , resulting in defective erythropoiesis ( Snow et al . , 2010 ) . By contrast , in mice lacking GATA motifs 2 . 8 kb upstream of Gata2 TSS , which overlaps with the E2 enhancer , Gata2 expres - sion is compromised in HSPCs ( Snow et al . , 2011 ) . Together with prior studies , our analyses demonstrate that qualitatively distinct and functionally divergent GATA switch en - hancers cooperate within the same enhancer cluster at the Gata2 locus . While the E2 and E3 enhancers are indispensable for maximal Gata2 activation in stem / progenitor cells , the E1 enhancer is required to maintain Gata2 repression in committed erythroid cells . Thus , despite the indistinguishable chromatin features among the GATA switch enhancers at the Gata2 locus , we reveal through in situ genomic editing the functional diversity of GATA switch enhancers whereby enhancers with opposing A 426 254 2035 1471 3421 150 1204 673 512 3101 4348 2697 C B 8632 3996 8496 A0 A5 A0 vs A5 A0 - A5 - Lost A0 - A5 - Gained A0 - A5 - Shared Distribution of GATA Switch Enhancers 14 % 47 % 39 % Lost Shared Gained GATA2 - Only GATA1 - Only GATA Switch G A T A 2 - O n l y G A T A 1 - O n l y G A T A S w i t c h Enhancers ELF1 SPI1 ( PU . 1 ) FEV FLI1 GABPAERG ETS1GATA2GATA4 GATA1 GATA3 TAL1 : : GATA1 C o f a c t o r - d r i v en M o t i f - d r i v en D GATA2 - Only GATA Switch GATA1 - Only ( 1721 ) ( 2108 ) ( 2905 ) 3 . 0 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 m RN A E x p r e s s i on ( z - sc o r e ) 0 3 5 7 HSPC ProE 0 3 5 7 HSPC ProE 0 3 5 7 HSPC ProE 0 3 5 7 HSPC ProE Genome Average ( 19851 ) Regulation of immune system process Immune response Regulation of immune response Abnormal adaptive immunity Abnormal immune cell physiology Abnormal hematopoiesis B cell activation Interleukin signaling pathway PDGF signaling pathway 1 10 100 Regulation of myeloid cell differentiation Peptidyl - tyrosine phosphorylation Actin cytoskeleton reorganization Abnormal bone marrow cell morphology Abnormal hematopoietic cell number Abnormal lymphocyte morphology Apoptosis signaling pathway B cell activation Negative regulation of cell - cell adhesion Sphingosine metabolic process Regulation of myeloid cell differentiation Abnormal hemoglobin Abnormal mean corpuscular volume Increased red blood cell distribution width EPO signaling pathway Signaling mediated by HDAC class I 1 10 100 1 - log 10 ( p - value ) 10 100 G A T A 2 - O n l y E nhan c e r s G A T A S w i t c h E nhan c e r s G A T A 1 - O n l y E nhan c e r s GO Biological Process Mouse Phenotypes Pathways Figure 6 .

DISCUSSION In Situ Perturbation of Enhancers The term ‘‘transcriptional enhancer’’ was ﬁrst introduced to describe the effects of SV40 DNA on the transcription of the rab - bit b - globin gene ( Banerji et al . , 1981 ) . Since then , enhancers have been routinely identiﬁed and characterized in ectopic heter - ologous reporter assays or by sequence analysis ( Bulger and Groudine , 2011 ; Pennacchio et al . , 2013 ; Visel et al . , 2007 ) . With the advent of genome - scale chromatin proﬁling , many pu - tative enhancers have been identiﬁed in the human genome ( Heintzman et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; Visel et al . , 2009a , 2009b ) . While the biological importance of enhancers could be inferred from these genome - scale studies , it remains challenging to ascertain the precise in vivo function of individual enhancers using conven - tional loss - of - function methods . Thus , advances in genome en - gineering technologies hold enormous promise for systematic evaluation of the functional signiﬁcance of enhancers in physio - logically relevant contexts ( Bauer et al . , 2013 ; Canver et al . , 2015 ; Groschel et al . , 2014 ; Hnisz et al . , 2015 ; Mansour et al . , 2014 ; Xu et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , we employed the CRISPR / Cas9 system to examine the functional requirements of a panel of discrete en - hancers in an experimental model recapitulating normal erythroid development . Our results reveal functional hierarchy of enhancer regulation within their native chromatin . We ﬁrst demonstrate the distinct roles of GATA switch and GATA2 - only ( or non - switch ) enhancers in the temporal control of gene tran - scription . Moreover , by systematic dissection of three distinct GATA switch enhancers at the Gata2 locus , our studies uncover functional divergence of enhancers cooperating within the same cluster . Despite the indistinguishable chromatin features based on ChIP - seq analyses , the neighboring GATA switch enhancers display distinct requirements for the precise control of Gata2 transcription . Hence , our studies highlight the power and neces - sity of combining genome - scale enhancer annotation with genomic editing for analyzing enhancer cooperation during line - age differentiation . We speculate that further in - depth studies of enhancer regulation through high - throughput , high - resolution in situ enhancer editing will likely uncover novel regulatory prin - ciples underlying the context - speciﬁc actions of enhancers in mammalian genomes . Hierarchical Composition of Erythroid Super - enhancers Highly marked clusters of enhancers or super - enhancers have been identiﬁed in various cell types ( Hnisz et al . , 2013 ; Parker et al . , 2013 ; Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Despite the proposed roles of super - enhancers in gene regulation and disease , the functional signiﬁcance of enhancer clustering within their native chromatin environment remains largely unexplored . More speciﬁcally , it is unclear whether super - enhancer represents a simple assembly of regular enhancers or whether it behaves as a single functional unit through cooperative activities of its constituent enhancers ( Pott and Lieb , 2015 ) . By focusing on the Slc25a37 super - enhancer , our studies demonstrate that the Slc25a37 clustered enhancers are composed of a functional hierarchy of constituent components , with some signiﬁcantly stronger than others for target gene expression during cellular differentiation . Strikingly , although all constituent enhancers possess similar levels of enhancer - asso - ciated histone marks and TF occupancy , deletion of each enhancer has a markedly distinct effect on Slc25a37 transcrip - tion . Our ﬁndings on the distinct requirement of enhancer constituents are consistent with a recent analysis of several super - enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells ( Hnisz et al . , 2015 ) . One critical difference , however , is that our studies were performed in cells undergoing lineage differentiation . Hence , we were able to analyze and compare the effects of each enhancer deletion during the spectrum of erythroid differentia - tion . Importantly , while deletion of individual Slc25a37 constitu - ent enhancers has minimal effects at the undifferentiated stage , deletion of E3 has a profound impact on Slc25a37 expression at later differentiation ( Figure 3C ) . The developmental stage - speciﬁc requirement of enhancer functions would have been overlooked if one had only analyzed the steady - state undifferen - tiated cells . Moreover , our results suggest a cooperative behavior in the recruitment of master TFs at the Slc25a37 super - enhancer . While deletion of E1 or E2 has a minimal effect on histone marks and TF occupancy at neighboring enhancers , loss of E3 substan - tially reduces H3K27ac and completely abolishes GATA1 / TAL1 binding at the neighboring enhancers . Combined deletion of E3 and neighboring enhancers further diminishes the tran - scriptional activity , the level of H3K27ac , and TF occupancy at Slc25a37 enhancer and promoter regions , suggesting that E3 cooperates with other constituent enhancers to achieve maximal activity . Interestingly , despite the profound impact on H3K27ac level , loss of individual enhancers or their combinations does not affect H3K4me1 , suggesting that the level of H3K27ac is more sensitive and predictive to transcriptional activities . Taken together , our results indicate that at least a subset of super - enhancers is organized in a hierarchical structure composed of enhancer constituents with non - redundant functions . Some con - stituent enhancers may possess signiﬁcantly stronger effects on transcription while others cooperate with the dominant en - hancers for maximal activity . These ﬁndings also raise the possi - bility that further in - depth dissection of super - enhancers by high - resolution genomic editing may unravel the regulatory com - ponents and distinct vulnerabilities underlying enhancer clus - tering in gene regulation . TF Combinatorial Rules Underlying Enhancer Dynamics during Erythropoiesis Enhancers are known to function as multifactorial platforms for binding of lineage - regulating TFs , chromatin regulators , and signaling effectors ( Buecker and Wysocka , 2012 ; Xu and Smale , 2012 ) . A long - standing question is how enhancers acquire the ability to translate intra - and extracellular signals to cell - type - speciﬁc transcriptional responses in development and disease . On the other hand , it is estimated that there are 2 , 000 – 3 , 000 sequence - speciﬁc DNA binding TFs encoded by the human genome ( Babu et al . , 2004 ) , with 200 – 300 TFs being expressed in each cell type ( Vaquerizas et al . , 2009 ) . However , the underly - ing principles by which TFs collaborate to regulate enhancer dy - namics are poorly understood . 20 Developmental Cell 36 , 9 – 23 , January 11 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . In this study , we developed a new network approach to con - nect TF occupancy , motif enrichment , and enhancer activity for illustration of the combinational regulatory mechanisms in complex differentiation processes . The rationale rests on accu - mulating evidence that enhancers are critical modulators of line - age - and stage - speciﬁc gene expression , and enrich for binding sequences ( or motifs ) for lineage - regulating TFs ( Figure 4A ) ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ; Neph et al . , 2012 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) . Using an ex vivo model for human erythropoiesis , we identiﬁed distinct sets of TF combinatorial modules as puta - tive drivers of enhancer turnover during erythroid differentiation . Of note , the HSPC - speciﬁc enhancer network is predomi - nantly modulated by the PU . 1 - RUNX1 - FLI1 - ETS - GATA2 combi - natorial interactions . In contrast , the erythroid - speciﬁc enhancer network is dominated by GATA1 - TAL1 together with IRF2 - STAT1 - STAT2 interactions ( Figures 5 , S5 , and Table S5 ) . More importantly , we identiﬁed previously unrecognized TF interaction modules including NFE2 - MYB and PRRX2 - ARID3A - GATA2 within the enhancer context , thus providing a platform for sub - stantive future investigations . Finally , in - depth experimental validation by ChIP - seq and CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated loss - of - function studies not only validated the overall approach but also provided novel insights into the structure - function rela - tionship of enhancer dynamics during erythroid speciﬁcation . Taken together , our studies demonstrate that the integrative analysis of genome - wide enhancer annotation coupled with in situ enhancer editing has the potential to identify the underly - ing regulatory components of enhancer - directed cellular pheno - types in complex developmental processes . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cells and Cell Culture Primary human adult and fetal CD34 + HSPCs were isolated as previously described ( Van Handel et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) . Primary fetal or adult committed proerythroblasts ( ProEs ) were generated ex vivo as previously described ( Sankaran et al . , 2009 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) . G1E / G1ER cells were cultured as described by Welch et al . ( 2004 ) . ChIP - Seq and Data Analysis ChIP - seq was performed as described by Xu et al . ( 2012 ) . Other ChIP - seq datasets were obtained from previous publications ( Abraham et al . , 2013 ; Beck et al . , 2013 ; ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ; Dogan et al . , 2015 ; Pinello et al . , 2014 ; Su et al . , 2013 ; Trompouki et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) . Enhancer Annotation Putative active enhancers were annotated using the peaks of H3K4me1 , H3K27ac , and H3K27me3 . In brief , H3K27ac peaks were used to deﬁne theenhancerboundary , followedbyﬁlteringbasedonthecriteria : ( 1 ) excluded H3K27ac peaks not overlapped with H3K4me1 peaks ; ( 2 ) excluded H3K27ac peaks located within ±2 - kb region of RefSeq - annotated promoters ; ( 3 ) excluded H3K27ac peaks overlapped with H3K27me3 peaks . Identiﬁcation of Lineage or Developmental Stage - Speciﬁc Enhancers Lineage - speciﬁc enhancers were identiﬁed by comparing A0 and A5 , or F0 and F5 enhancers . Similarly , stage - speciﬁc enhancers were identiﬁed by comparing F0 and A0 , or F5 and A5 enhancers . The overlapped ( R 1 bp ) enhancers were considered as ‘‘shared’’ enhancers and the remainder as ‘‘lost’’ or ‘‘gained’’ enhancers . To obtain the high - conﬁdence enhancers , we ﬁltered the enhancers using MAnorm ( Shao et al . , 2012 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) for H3K27ac ( referred as M H3K27ac ) . For lineage or stage - speciﬁc enhancers , we only keep enhancers with j M H3K27ac j > 1 ; for shared enhancers we keep en - hancers with j M H3K27ac j % 1 . Motif Enrichment Analysis The position weight matrices of 196 core vertebrate motifs were downloaded fromtheJASPARdatabase ( Mathelieretal . , 2014 ) . Themotifenrichmentscore was deﬁned as (cid:1) log 10 ( p value ) , where p value is the signiﬁcance of observed over - representation of each motif in enhancer regions compared with randomly selected control regions . Motif modules were detected based on the hierarchical clustering of motif enrichment scores across lineage or stage - speciﬁc enhancers ( Table S2 ) . Construction of Enhancer - Mediated TF Regulatory Networks The enrichment score was calculated to measure the signiﬁcance of the enrichmentofTFChIP - seqpeaks ( ormotif - matchedloci ) withineachenhancer type relative to the genome background . The combinational score was calcu - lated to measure the frequency of co - occurrence of two TFs at the same enhancer compared with the genome background . TF or motif pairs with signiﬁcant combinational scores were selected to assemble the networks in Cytoscape ( Shannon et al . , 2003 ) . Enhancer Editing by CRISPR / Cas9 The clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) / CRISPR - associated ( Cas ) 9 nuclease system was used for enhancer - deletion analyses following published protocols ( Cong et al . , 2013 ; Mali et al . , 2013 ) .
