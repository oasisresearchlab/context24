Yin * Background : Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking . It stimulates de novo actin polymerization by activating the pathway involving the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and the actin - related protein complex Arp2 / 3 . Other studies show that actin polymerizes from cholesterol – sphingolipid - rich membrane microdomains called ‘rafts’ , in a manner dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation . Although actin has been implicated in vesicle trafficking , and rafts are sites of active phosphoinositide and tyrosine kinase signaling that mediate apically directed vesicle trafficking , it is not known whether phosphoinositide regulation of actin dynamics occurs in rafts , or if it is linked to vesicle movements . Results : Overexpression of type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5KI ) , which synthesizes PIP 2 , promoted actin polymerization from membrane - bound vesicles to form motile actin comets . Pervanadate ( PV ) , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , induced comets even in the absence of PIP5KI overexpression . PV increased PIP 2 levels , suggesting that it induces comets by changing PIP 2 homeostasis and by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation . Platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) enhanced PV - induced comet formation , and these stimuli together potentiated the PIP5KI effect . The vesicles at the heads of comets were enriched in PIP5KIs and tyrosine phosphoproteins . WASP – Arp2 / 3 involvement was established using dominant - negative WASP constructs . Endocytic and exocytic markers identified vesicles enriched in lipid rafts as preferential sites of comet generation . Extraction of cholesterol with methyl - b - cyclodextrin reduced comets , establishing that rafts promote comet formation . Conclusions : Sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts are preferred platforms for membrane - linked actin polymerization . This is mediated by in situ PIP 2 synthesis and tyrosine kinase signaling through the WASP – Arp2 / 3 pathway . Actin comets may provide a novel mechanism for raft - dependent vesicle transport and apical membrane trafficking . Background Membrane phosphoinositides regulate fundamental cell processes such as actin cytoskeletal remodeling and vesicle trafficking . How signaling from the outside of the cell is transduced through messengers such as phosphoinositides into spatially regulated actin - polymerization - driven move - ments [ 1 , 2 ] , or vesicle transport [ 3 , 4 ] , has been extensively studied in vitro and in cell - free extracts . In particular , phos - phatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) has been impli - cated because it regulates the activity of proteins in the cytoskeletal and vesicle - trafficking pathways . Nevertheless , the mechanisms by which PIP 2 regulates these processes , and the relationship between them , are not well understood . Recently , proteins of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family have been recognized as a major stimulus for de novo actin nucleation from the actin - related protein complex Arp2 / 3 [ 5 ] . N - WASP , a ubiquitous member of this family , is activated by PIP 2 in vitro [ 6 , 7 ] and may be responsible for a variety of polymerization - driven cell - shape changes [ 8 ] . Studies using Xenopus extracts show that N - WASP stimulates the formation of actin comet tails around endogenous vesicles or exoge - nous PIP 2 vesicles , in a PIP 2 - and tyrosine - phosphoryla - tion - dependent manner [ 7 ] . Although actin comets are rarely seen in normal cells , similar comet tails are found in cells infected with intracellular pathogens , such as Listeria , vaccinia and Shigella [ 9 , 10 ] . These pathogens recruit host WASPs , or pathogen - derived proteins mimicking WASP , to harness the host Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization machin - ery . In the case of vaccinia , N - WASP recruitment is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of a vaccinia Addresses : * Departments of Physiology and Biochemistry , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard , Dallas , Texas 75390 , USA . ‡ Division of Molecular Cell Biology , School of Biosciences , University of Birmingham , Edgbaston , Birmingham B15 2TT , UK . § MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology and Department of Biochemistry , University College London , Gower Street , London WC1E 6BT , UK . ¶ Biomolecular and Cellular Dynamics Research Group , Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry , 82152 Martinsried , Germany .

The relationship between PIP 2 and tyrosine phosphorylation in actin comet tail formation in Xenopus extracts and in vaccinia - infected cells has not been explored . In addition to its role in cytoskeletal reorganization , PIP 2 has been implicated in vesicle trafficking . It is a cofactor for the activation of phospholipase D [ 11 ] , and it influences the function and regulation of the small G protein ADP - ribosy - lation factors ( ARFs ) [ 12 ] . Type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 - kinases ( PIP5KIs ) , the major class of enzymes that synthesize PIP 2 from phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PIP ) [ 13 ] , are recruited to the Golgi complex by ARFs [ 14 ] . They are activated by ARF6 [ 15 ] , which also regulates an endosomal – plasma membrane recycling pathway and actin remodeling [ 16 ] . The observations that endogenous mem - brane vesicles and exogenously added synthetic PIP 2 vesi - cles are propelled by actin comets in cell extracts [ 7 ] raise the possibility of a direct linkage between PIP 2 , actin poly - merization and vesicle transport . Evidence for actin involve - ment in endocytosis [ 17 – 19 ] and regulated exocytosis [ 20 ] is only beginning to emerge in vertebrate systems . The exact role that actin plays is still not clear . The possibility that actin is involved in vesicle transport is also supported by unrelated studies that show that actin polymerizes from cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich mem - brane microdomains called rafts or caveolae [ 21 ] . During T - cell activation , stable patches of raft lipids , actin fila - ments and Src family tyrosine kinases accumulate at cell – cell contacts [ 22 , 23 ] . Lipid rafts are actively involved in many forms of signaling [ 22 ] , including tyrosine phos - phorylation and PIP 2 turnover [ 24 ] , and are required to deliver Golgi - derived secretory vesicles to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells [ 21 ] . The convergence of these studies raises the possibility that PIP 2 synthesis in raft domains in situ can stimulate actin polymerization to drive membrane vesicle movement . Here , we determined whether PIP 2 can act as an upstream activator of actin polymerization in live cells , examined the relationship between PIP 2 and tyrosine phosphorylation , and explored the potential role of PIP 2 - activated actin polymerization in raft - dependent vesicle transport . Results Cells form actin comet tails in response to PIP5KI overexpression To explore the relationship between PIP 2 and actin dynamics , we overexpressed several Myc - epitope - tagged PIP5KI isotypes in cells by microinjection and plasmid transfection . Three human and three mouse PIP5KI iso - types , named a , b and g , have been cloned [ 13 ] . As the mouse and human isotypes were named arbitrarily , we will use the mouse isotype designation here [ 25 ] . We have ver - ified that overexpression of PIP5KI increases PIP 2 synthe - sis ( M . Y . and H . L . Y . , unpublished observations ) . Microinjection of the Myc - tagged cDNA for a novel variant form of mouse PIP5KI a ( referred to as PIP5KI a¢ ; see the Materials and methods ) into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts cultured in 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) induced the formation of numerous filamentous actin - containing comets resembling those found in pathogen - infected cells ( Figure 1a ) . There was also an increase in the number of phalloidin - stained actin spots , which we will refer to as actin foci . Of the 13 micro - injected Swiss 3T3 cells counted by confocal microscopy , about 30 % of the actin foci ( out of 1102 ) and 50 % of the comets ( out of 185 ) were strongly stained with anti - Myc antibody , indicating the presence of Myc – PIP5KI a¢ ( Figure 1a , b , arrowheads and arrows , respectively ) . Overexpression of two other PIP5KI isoforms ( the ‘classi - cal’ PIP5KI a and PIP5KI b ) by cDNA - mediated transient transfection in Swiss 3T3 and other cells also induced comets . REF52 cells generated particularly good comets and are shown in Figure 1c , d . The non - transfected cells did not form comets or actin foci and had more stress fibers than the transfected cells . Occasionally , the comets protruded from the cell surface , and looked remarkably similar to protruding Listeria comets ( see below ) . Like the Myc – PIP5KI a¢ - induced comets , many of the Myc – PIP5KI b - induced comets were stained with anti - Myc antibody ( Table 1 ) . We suspect that Myc – PIP5KIs induced actin foci and comets in all cases , but the Myc – PIP5KI level may not always be high enough for consistent detection by immunofluorescence . PIP5KI was sometimes at the heads of the comets only ( Figure 1e – g ) , and sometimes at both the comet heads and tails . Characterization of comet motility in live cells We used actin coupled to the green fluorescent protein ( GFP – actin ) [ 26 ] to characterize the motility of actin comets in cells microinjected with Myc – PIP5KI a¢ . Swiss 3T3 cells were coinjected with the cDNAs for GFP – actin and Myc – PIP5KI a¢ . GFP – actin was incorporated into foci , comets and other actin structures ( Figure 2a ) . At early time points ( approximately 2 – 4 hours post - injection ) , stress fibers were , for the most part , intact and the comet tails were less than 5 m m long ( see the Supplementary material ) . At later times ( 6 – 8 hours post - injection ) , stress fibers disappeared completely and most of the actin was recruited into very long comets , which reached up to 20 m m in length . Shorter comets physically translocated across the cell ( Figure 2b – d ) at 22 ± 9 m m / minute ( n = 55 ) , and they had an average life span of 2 . 2 ± 1 minute ( n = 18 ) . Listeria tails move at a comparable speed ( 14 m m / minute ) but persist longer ( 30 minutes ) . Comets are formed in response to increased tyrosine phosphorylation Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the generation of vaccinia comets , but not for Listeria and Shigella 312 Current Biology Vol 10 No 6 bb10f32 . qxd 04 / 14 / 2000 12 : 57 Page 312 comets [ 9 , 10 ] . Orthovanadate , a tyrosine - phosphatase inhibitor , induces actin comets in Xenopus extracts [ 7 ] . We assessed the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation for PIP5KI - induced comet formation in a number of ways . The Myc – PIP5KI - induced comets had tyrosine phospho - proteins at their heads ( Figure 3a – c , arrows and inset ; Table 1 ) . The centers of many actin foci were also stained with anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( Figure 3a – c , arrow - head ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation appeared to be impor - tant for PIP5KI - induced comet formation because genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , partially suppressed comet formation ( Figure 4a ) . Pervanadate ( PV ) , a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , induced some comets even in cells not overexpressing PIP5KI ( Figure 4b ) ; 50 m M PV was already maximally effective ( data not shown ) . The PV effect was greatly aug - mented by platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , which on its own did not induce comets ( Figure 4b ) . Genistein , which inhibited comet formation in PIP5KI overexpress - ing cells , also inhibited comet formation in cells treated with PV alone or together with PDGF ( data not shown ) . These results establish that PV stimulates comet forma - tion in a tyrosine - phosphorylation - dependent manner . Wortmannin , which inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase , did not block comets , suggesting that phos - phatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) is not involved in this process . Comets generated by PV and PDGF were , on average , larger than the PIP5KI a - induced comets ( compare Figure 1c , d with Figure 3d ; Table 1 ) . In favorable images , the concave surface at the broad end of the comet cupped a spherical structure ( defined as the head ; Figure 3d ) . Some comet heads stained solidly with phalloidin , while others appeared hollow . Likewise , some phalloidin - stained actin foci appeared as solid dots or hollow circles surrounded by a rim of actin filaments . The foci and circles at the head of the comets were similar in size , and ranged from 0 . 5 – 2 m m in diameter . We speculate that the actin foci and comets represent variations of the same phenomenon . Comets are formed by asymmetric actin polymerization from one side of the spheres , while foci are formed by symmetric actin polymerization around the spheres . We have not explored further the relationship between actin foci and comets , and will focus mainly on the comets here . We show later that the heads of comets contain membrane - bound vesicles ( see below ) . As in the case of the PIP5KI - induced comets , comets gen - erated by PV and PDGF had tyrosine phosphoproteins on their heads ( Table 1 ) . They often had phosphotyrosines along the entire tail as well , probably reflecting hyper - phosphorylation of tail components .

PV alone increased 32 P incorporation into PIP 2 and PIP by 210 % and 155 % , respectively ( Figure 4d , lanes 1 , 2 ) . These effects may be due to the activation of lipid kinases and / or inactivation of lipid phosphatases . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was not detected at this exposure . PDGF did not increase PIP 2 levels further ( lane 3 ) . As PV increased the PIP 2 level but did not maximally stimulate comets unless PDGF was also present , PV probably induces comets not only by increasing PIP 2 level , but also by prolonging tyrosine phosphorylation signals that are transiently stimulated by PDGF , and by acti - vating other parallel pathways that remain to be identified . To evaluate the relationship between PV + PDGF stimula - tion and PIP5KI activation , PV and PDGF were added to cells that were transfected with PIP5KI b cDNA for a shorter time than required to maximally stimulate comet formation ( Figure 4c ) . A lower percentage of cells formed comets after short PIP5KI b overexpression ( compare Figure 4c with Figure 4a ) . PV + PDGF induced a greater than additive increase in comet formation in the PIP5KI b - overexpressing cells . Therefore , PV together with PDGF stimulates comet formation synergistically with PIP5KI b , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation and PIP 2 cooper - ate to promote actin polymerization . Comet formation requires proteins of the WASP family and the Arp2 / 3 complex The actin comets were characterized further using a panel of antibodies against proteins found in Listeria comets . The Arp2 / 3 complex was present in the comet heads and tails ( Figure 3e ) , as has been described for Listeria comets [ 27 ] . Actin - binding proteins such as vinculin , a - actinin , zyxin , gelsolin and Mena , a member of the vasodilator - stimu - lated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) family , were also present ( data not shown ) . We expressed full - length and truncated proteins of the WASP family in cells to determine whether WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex are involved in comet generation . WASP and N - WASP have several well - defined functional domains ( Figure 5a ) [ 5 ] : a WASP homology 1 ( WH1 ) motif that binds PIP 2 [ 6 ] ; a CRIB homology sequence that binds Cdc42 ; a proline - rich region ( PRO ) that binds SH3 pro - teins ; one or two WASP homology 2 motifs ( WH2 or W ) that bind actin monomers ; and a carboxy - terminal acidic ( A ) motif that binds the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 28 ] . Scar1 , another WASP family protein , also has the W and A motifs ( WA ) and the proline - rich domain . 314 Current Biology Vol 10 No 6 Figure 3 Relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and actin comets in REF52 cells .

In contrast , Scar1 - W , which binds actin monomers but not Arp2 / 3 , did not block comet formation . Therefore , inhibition by WA was most likely due to sequestration of endogenous Arp2 / 3 complexes , and not simply due to sequestration of actin monomers . Overexpression of WASP , N - WASP , Scar1 and their WA fragments also inhibited comets in cells treated with PV and PDGF ( Figure 5c ) . In each case , cell shape was not dramatically altered , although there was an increase in diffuse perinuclear phalloidin staining ( data not shown ) , as reported previously [ 28 ] . Some of these constructs ( WASP , Scar1 and their WA domains ) also induced a decrease in stress fiber staining , suggesting that the cytoskeleton was extensively reorganized . Other constructs ( N - WASP and Myc – N - WASP D WA , see below ) did not decrease stress fiber staining , even though they inhibited comet forma - tion ( see Supplementary material ) . Therefore , inhibition of comet formation did not necessarily reflect large - scale actin reorganization . These results demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in comet formation in response to PIP5KI overexpression or treatment with PV and PDGF .

Overexpressed Myc – N - WASP D WA inhibited comets as effectively as WASP – WA ( Figure 5c ) . It increased perinuclear phalloidin staining but did not decrease stress fiber staining ( data not shown ) . We hypothesize that Myc – N - WASP D WA exerts a domi - nant - negative effect by competing with endogenous WASP family proteins for activating signals such as PIP 2 or proline - rich domain binding partners . Identification of the cargo at the heads of the comets Using CellTracker CM - DiI to label membrane lipids , we found that 70 % of the comets showed DiI staining at their heads ( Table 2 , Figure 6a ) . Some comets ( 26 % ) were associated with endocytic vesicles , as detected by the presence of the fluid - phase marker dextran ( Figure 6b , Table 2 ) . Most comets ( 61 % ) were , however , associated with Golgi - derived vesicles ( Figure 6d , Table 2 ) . This was established by using fluorescent ceramide as a vital dye for the Golgi , which converts membrane - exchange - able ceramide to a non - exchangeable sphingolipid [ 29 ] . In the next section , we provide additional evidence for the Golgi - origin of the vesicles at the heads of the comets . Confocal microscopy gave similar values , demon - strating that the vesicles were truly at the heads of the comets ( Table 2 ) . Preferential comet generation by vesicles enriched in sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains Ceramide / sphingolipid labeling of the heads of comets prompted us to determine whether the vesicles were enriched in sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains . Studies with polarized epithelial cells have shown that many newly synthesized proteins in the trans - Golgi network that are destined for the apical membrane are segregated into mem - brane microdomains rich in lateral assemblies of sphin - golipids and cholesterol ( called ‘rafts’ ) [ 21 ] . Proteins destined for the basolateral surface are excluded from rafts and are sorted into vesicles that have a more representative glycerophospholipid composition . Cells that are not overtly polarized , like the fibroblasts used in this study , also deploy these two distinct pathways [ 30 , 31 ] . By expressing specific viral glycoproteins to identify api - cally and basolaterally sorted secretory vesicles , we found that the two populations had significantly different fre - quencies of comet formation . Vesicles carrying an apical marker protein , influenza virus hemagglutinin ( HA ) , accounted for the majority of the comets ( Figure 6e , f ) . Figure 6f shows an image of an HA vesicle at the head of a comet that is protruding from the plasma membrane . We frequently observed protruding tails ( see also Figure 6a ) , which would be consistent with vesicle delivery from the Golgi to the cell surface . The number of HA vesicles associ - ating with comets increased linearly with time 3 hours after infection ( Figure 7a ) . We found that there was prominent HA staining of the perinuclear Golgi complex between 3 – 4 hours , but almost no HA staining of the plasma mem - brane ( data not shown ) . HA was found at the plasma mem - brane subsequently , and reached a steady state level at the plasma membrane by 5 hours post - infection . The associa - tion of HA vesicles with comets early during infection argues that most of these comets are derived from the Golgi , and not from the plasma membrane . In contrast , vesicles containing a basolateral marker , vesic - ular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G ( VSV - G ) , rarely 316 Current Biology Vol 10 No 6 Figure 6 Characterization of the cargo at the head of comets .

Parallel studies of VSV and influenza virus infection showed that VSV had a more accelerated time course . VSV - G accumulated in the Golgi between 1 and 2 hours after infection , and reached steady state concentration at the plasma membrane by 3 – 4 hours . The frequency of comets carrying VSV - G was very low throughout the entire time period . The low frequency of comet formation from VSV - G vesi - cles was established conclusively by the pulse - chase experi - ment shown in Figure 7b , which follows the transport of the temperature - sensitive mutant virus ts045 . The virus is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) at the restric - tive temperature . Upon shifting to the permissive tempera - ture , the ts045 VSV - G protein moves synchronously to the Golgi by 40 minutes and arrives at the plasma membrane between 60 – 100 minutes [ 32 ] . The VSV - G ts045 - contain - ing vesicles accounted for less than 6 % of the total comets in the first 90 minutes , and only generated a small number of comets ( 15 % ) at 120 minutes . The low frequency and the delay in comet formation suggest that VSV - G - containing vesicles that bud off the Golgi have a very low tendency to form comets , and that those associated with comets late in infection are probably from vesicles containing reinternal - ized VSV - G . Even so , the percentage of comets containing VSV - G is much lower than those containing HA . Preferential comet induction from membranes enriched in sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains was confirmed by examining the association of different types of endocytic vesicles with comets . Cholera toxin B subunit binds the lipid ganglioside GM1 , and is internalized through a sphin - golipid – cholesterol - dependent pathway [ 31 ] . Transferrin is internalized through a clathrin - dependent pathway that does not involve sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains . Endocytic vesicles containing cholera toxin were frequently at the heads of the comets ( 53 % ) ( Figure 6c ) , while those with transferrin were rarely there ( 2 % ; Table 2 ) . Cholesterol is required for comet formation Cholesterol is an essential component of sphingolipid – cho - lesterol microdomains . Cholesterol depletion decreases trans - port of HA to the apical membrane of epithelial cells [ 33 ] and inhibits cholera toxin internalization [ 34 ] . It also disperses PIP 2 from sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains and inhibits hormone - stimulated phosphoinositide turnover [ 35 ] . Under controlled conditions , methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( CDX ) selectively and rapidly extracts cholesterol from the mem - brane of living cells without affecting viability [ 33 , 36 ] . At 37°C , this extraction affects Golgi as well as plasma mem - brane , as they are connected through recycling pathways . CDX inhibited comet formation in a time - dependent manner . After 1 hour , there was a 55 % reduction in cells with comets ( Figure 7c ) . This level of inhibition is reason - able , as CDX does not block cholesterol synthesis and therefore should not completely deplete cellular choles - terol . In conclusion , our results show that cholesterol is required for the formation of actin comets from endoge - nous vesicles and suggests that sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains are the favored platforms for actin polymer - ization through a PIP 2 - and tyrosine - phosphorylation - reg - ulated WASP – Arp2 / 3 pathway . Discussion The possibility that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in membrane trafficking is very attractive , but a direct cause - and - effect relationship has not been established .

( b ) Comets associated with vesicles containing the ts045 VSV - G as a function of time after shift from the restrictive to the permissive temperature . ( c ) Effects of CDX on comet formation . The value without CDX treatment was set as 100 % on the comet formation index . Mean ± SEM values of two independent experiments were plotted ; p < 0 . 05 , compared with the untreated sample . bb10f32 . qxd 04 / 14 / 2000 12 : 57 Page 317 is well documented that in the yeast , Saccharomyces cere - visiae , the actin cytoskeleton regulates receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 37 ] . The picture is less clear in vertebrate cells , even though several steps in membrane transport are inhibited by cytoskeleton - altering agents [ 17 – 20 ] , and cytoskeletal proteins are sometimes associated with trans - port vesicles [ 38 , 39 ] . It is not known whether actin plays an active or a permissive role , however . Recently , several fields converged to suggest that actin may have an active role in vesicle trafficking . PIP 2 stimu - lates actin polymerization around membrane vesicles to generate comets in vitro [ 6 – 8 ] , and local production of PIP 2 has also been separately implicated in vesicle traf - ficking [ 3 , 11 , 14 – 16 ] . We now have evidence for a direct molecular linkage between actin polymerization and mem - brane transport . We found that PIP 2 synthesis and tyrosine phosphorylation in situ induced actin polymerization around membrane vesicles to form comet tails , which propel the vesicles within the cytoplasm . In addition , we established that actin polymerized preferentially from Golgi - derived membrane vesicles enriched in sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts through a WASP – Arp2 / 3 - dependent pathway . Rafts are sites of active phosphoinositide metabolism , tyrosine phos - phorylation and signal - induced actin polymerization [ 22 , 23 ] , and raft lipids are required for apical vesicle sorting . Our study raises the exciting possibility that local production of PIP 2 contributes to apical vesicle trafficking through an active actin - dependent mechanism . Prior to this study , comets were rarely observed in unin - fected cells . Some exceptions are mast cells treated with phorbol esters under hypotonic conditions [ 38 ] , and HeLa cells that form ‘little actin tails’ constitutively [ 9 ] . In both cases , the stimuli for tail formation were not identified . These results suggest that actin comets are formed under normal physiological conditions , but may often have eluded detection because they are tiny and short - lived . We hypothesize that the PIP5KI - and PV - induced comets are exaggerations of a normal cellular process in which actin is assembled around nascent transport vesicles . Poly - merized actin may provide structural support and perhaps generate movement . The remarkable PIP5KI overexpres - sion phenotype described here is distinct from those reported previously . Others found that overexpression of PIP5KI induces ‘pine needle’ - like actin structures that were minimally characterized [ 25 ] . One of us has previ - ously shown that PIP5KI overexpression increases the motility of pre - existing motile actin spots [ 40 ] , which are not usually associated with comet tails . The actin comets in non - infected cells are generated through a synergism between PIP 2 synthesis and tyro - sine phosphorylation . PIP5KIs are recruited to vesicles , highlighting the importance of local PIP 2 generation to elicit spatially controlled actin polymerization . All three of the PIP5KI isoforms tested generated comets , attesting to the universality of this response . Tyrosine phosphopro - teins were also recruited to the vesicles . Tyrosine phos - phorylation may potentiate the recruitment / activation of PIP5KIs in several ways . PV increases PIP 2 levels , and others have proposed that tyrosine phosphorylated mem - brane proteins may recruit Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain - containing adapter proteins that bind N - WASP [ 41 ] , in a manner similar to that demonstrated for vaccinia [ 10 ] . In addition , tyrosine kinases may directly phosphorylate N - WASP , as has been shown for WASP [ 42 ] . Previous studies suggest that actin may be involved in vesicular trafficking in vertebrate cells at several steps . First , the actin cytoskeleton may contribute to budding of vesicles from membranes . Actin polymerizes around macropinocytic vesicles in mast cells [ 38 ] . Second , actin filaments may serve as highways for myosin - mediated short - range transport of vesicles . This mode of transport is thought to be particularly important in regions devoid of microtubules , such as the neuronal growth cone or the fibroblast lamellipodium . Consistent with this hypothesis , a small myosin is associated with apically transported vesi - cles in epithelial cells [ 39 ] . Our results raise the possibility of a third mechanism by which actin is involved in vesicle trafficking : actin comets may propel sphinogolipid – choles - terol - rich vesicles . Significantly , it has been shown previ - ously that cytochalasin D inhibits the endocytosis of cholera toxin ( raft - dependent ) but not of transferrin ( raft - independent ) [ 19 ] . This differential sensitivity is consis - tent with our finding that actin comets propel endocytic vesicles containing the former , but not the latter , cargo . Actin comets have been used very successfully by intra - cellular pathogens for propulsion , and are likely to have a physiological role in normal host cell functions as well . The actin comet transport system may gain specificity through the use of different PIP5KI isoforms , by balanc - ing the interplay between lipid and protein phosphatases and kinases , and through regulation by selected GTPases . Our finding that actin comets are generated preferentially from sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains suggests an integrated model in which the lipid microenvironment provides a scaffold to recruit and activate proteins for signal transduction , cytoskeletal regulation and membrane trafficking [ 22 ] . Further studies using this model may provide novel molecular insights into the mechanism of apical trafficking , which is much less well understood than that of the basolateral pathway . Materials and methods Reagents All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise . Human recombinant PDGF - AB was from Upstate Biol . CellTracker (cid:212) CM - DiI , Bodipy ® Texas Red - Ceramide and lysine - fixable tetramethyl - rhodamine dextran were purchased from Molecular Probes . 318 Current Biology Vol 10 No 6 bb10f32 . qxd 04 / 14 / 2000 12 : 57 Page 318 Expression constructs All molecular biology was performed using standard methods . The cDNA for mouse PIP5KI a¢ was obtained from the ATCC ( clone 728294 ) , subcloned into pRK5 - Myc and sequenced . It has six amino - acid differences from the previously published mouse PIP5KI a sequence ( GenBank accession number D86176 ) and is 93 % identical at the nucleotide level . We have named this unique variant mPIP5KI a¢ ( GenBank accession number AF048695 ) . The human PIP5KI a cDNA ( which is equivalent to mouse PIP5KI b , and referred to as PIP5KI b here ) and mouse PIP5KI a were obtained by PCR amplification from cDNA pools and cloned into an expression vector ( pCMV5 ) containing sequence encoding a Myc tag at the 5 ¢ end . They were identical to the published sequence ( GenBank accession numbers NM003557 and D86176 ) . Amino - terminal Myc - tagged WASP , Scar1 , WA and W domains were all in pRK5 - Myc as described previously [ 28 ] . Myc – N - WASP was generated by transferring the N - WASP cDNA [ 6 ] into a pCMV5 / Myc3 expression vector . Myc – N - WASP D WA was generated by inserting a stop codon before the beginning of the W domain of N - WASP ( amino acid D396 ) . Microinjection , transient transfection and immunofluorescence Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % FCS [ 43 ] . Cells were microinjected with cesium chloride gradient - purified pRK5 - Myc cDNA ( needle con - centration of 0 . 1 mg / ml ) [ 44 ] . Cells were returned to the 37°C incubator for 2 h , fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton - X100 . They were incubated with antibodies and fluorescent phalloidin and examined by epifluorescence and confocal microscopy . For live cell studies , Swiss 3T3 cells coinjected with cDNAs encoding PIP5KI a¢ and GFP – actin cDNA were observed 2 h post - injection in a 37°C chamber in HEPES - buffered DMEM ( pH 7 . 2 ) . GFP – actin fluorescence was recorded under time lapse using a Hammamatsu 4880 cooled CCD camera . REF52 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10 % FCS . They were transfected with 1 m g plasmid cDNA with FuGENE6 ( Roche ) in 0 . 5 % FCS . Plasmid pEGFP - C1 ( enhanced GFP , Clontech ) was used in control transfections . Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining 20 – 24 h after transfection . In most cases , cells were fixed in formaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X - 100 . Anti - phosphotyro - sine antibody staining was performed on cells fixed with 50 % / 100 % / 50 % acetone for 2 min / 5 min / 2 min , respectively , at – 20°C . Anti - Arp3 antibody staining was done on cells permeabilized with Triton X - 100 prior to fixation in formaldehyde and methanol [ 27 ] . Comet forma - tion was quantitated by counting , in a ‘blinded’ fashion , the number of cells with one or more comets and the number of comets with vesicular markers in randomly chosen fields . All microinjected or transfected cells that were well spread ( as in control cells ) were scored without further preselection . More than 100 cells were counted per condition , and the experiments were repeated at least three times . PV and genistein treatments Genistein , dissolved in DMSO as a 100 mM solution , was added to cells at a final concentration of 100 m M for 1 h before fixation or other treatments . An equivalent amount of solvent was added to control cells . PV was prepared by incubating 50 mM sodium orthovanadate with 1 . 7 mM H 2 O 2 in the dark at room temperature for 20 min , followed by 200 m g / ml catalase for 5 min to dissipate residual H 2 O 2 [ 44 ] . Freshly prepared PV was added to REF52 that had been cultured in 0 . 5 % FCS for 20 – 24 h to final concentrations of 2 mM , 200 or 50 m M . After 15 min , PDGF ( 30 ng / ml ) was added to the same media for an addi - tional 10 min . In some cases , cells pretreated with genistein were stim - ulated with 200 m M PV , either with or without PDGF treatments . Labeling vesicles with fluorescent markers REF52 cells were labeled with fluorescent vesicle markers . All incuba - tions were at 37°C unless otherwise indicated . CellTracker (cid:212) CM - DiI ( 2 mM for 30 min ) was used to label cell membranes . Bodipy ® Texas Red - Ceramide was used to label membranes in the Golgi secretory pathways using a pulse - chase procedure [ 29 ] . It was added to cells with an equimolar amount of defatted BSA ( 5 m M ) . After 1 h , cells were washed and unmetabolized ceramide was exchanged from the plasma membrane by incubation in DMEM containing 5 m M defatted BSA for 15 min . Rhodamine – dextran ( a macropinocytic marker ) was added to the culture medium at 1 – 5 mg / ml for 1 h . Fluorescent cholera toxin B ( an endocytic marker ) was added at 8 m g / ml in DMEM containing 0 . 03 % defatted BSA . Cells were incubated for 15 min at 4°C , followed by 2 . 5 h at 37°C . Fluorescent transferrin ( an endocytic marker ) was added at 20 m g / ml for 15 – 30 min . Thin layer chromatography REF52 cells were labeled for 4 h in phosphate - free DMEM containing 0 . 5 % FCS and 40 m Ci / ml 32 P - PO 4 . Cells were stimulated with 2 mM PV and PDGF as described above at the end of the labeling period . Lipids were extracted , resolved by thin layer chromatography [ 45 ] , and detected by autoradiography . Lipid standards were detected with iodine vapor . Virus infection REF52 cells grown in 0 . 5 % serum were exposed to viruses in serum - free medium . Influenza ( HA ) viruses were added at > 10 pfu / cell for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 0 . 5 m g / ml trypsin . Wild type and ts045 VSV viruses were added at > 10 pfu / cell for 15 min at 4°C . Wild - type viruses were returned to DMEM with 0 . 5 % FCS at 37°C and moni - tored for viral protein expression at timed intervals . The ts045 VSV infected cells were cultured at 32°C for 30 min , and then grown at 39 . 5°C for 3 . 5 h . Cells were shifted to 32°C to follow the time course of protein secretion . HA and VSV - G were detected with monoclonal antibodies to HA and G , respectively . CDX treatment REF52 cells were incubated with serum - free DMEM containing 10 mM CDX and 50 mM HEPES for 0 . 5 – 1 h [ 36 ] . They were washed and returned to DMEM with 0 . 5 % FCS for 15 min before stimulation with PV and PDGF .
