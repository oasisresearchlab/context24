At Drosophila neuromuscular junctions , syndapin is associated predominantly with a tubulolamellar postsynaptic membrane system known as the subsynaptic reticulum ( SSR ) . We show that syndapin overexpression greatly expands this postsynaptic membrane system . Syndapin can expand the SSR in the absence of dPAK and Dlg , two known regulators of SSR development . Syndapin’s N - terminal F - BAR domain , required for membrane tubulation in cultured cells , is required for SSR expansion . Consistent with a model in which syndapin acts directly on postsynaptic membrane , SSR expansion requires conserved residues essential for membrane binding in vitro . However , syndapin’s Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain , which negatively regulates membrane tubulation in cultured cells , is required for synaptic targeting and strong SSR induction . Our observations advance knowledge of syndapin protein function by 1 ) demon - strating the in vivo relevance of membrane remodeling mechanisms suggested by previous in vitro and structural analyses , 2 ) showing that SH3 domains are necessary for membrane expansion observed in vivo , and 3 ) conﬁrming that F - BAR proteins control complex membrane structures . INTRODUCTION Membrane structure is regulated by membrane - binding pro - teins that interact with the underlying cytoskeleton . During endocytosis , membranes are locally deformed to create shal - low invaginations that deepen into hemispherical buds , which precede the formation of tight vesicle necks where dynamin - dependent membrane scission occurs ( Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ; Farsad and De Camilli , 2003 ; Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2006 ) . Recent ﬁndings that different F - BAR domain proteins form and stabilize membrane structures of different diameters , have contributed substantially to the molecular understanding of how this sequence of events occurs ( Habermann , 2004b ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . BAR and F - BAR / EFC proteins show in vitro liposome - tubulating activity similar to those described previously for dynamin ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . However , the crescent - shaped F - BAR / EFC domains usually form wider lipid tubules , whose diameters are broadly consistent with intrinsic do - main curvatures determined by x - ray crystallography ( Mc - Mahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , F - BAR proteins FBP17 and CIP4 , with an intrinsic curvature of 60 nm , form tubules whose diameter is larger than those formed by BAR domains of amphiphysin , which has a tighter intrinsic curvature of 22 nm . Therefore , F - BAR pro - teins may function early in the process of endocytosis to stabilize wide membrane invaginations ; BAR domain pro - teins may help form narrower membrane necks where dy - namin and membrane ﬁssion proteins function ( Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ; Habermann , 2004a ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ) . Studies in cultured cells are consistent with the above - mentioned model . Overexpression of any of several F - BAR / EFC domain proteins including syndapin / Pacsin enhances formation of tubular intermediates of membrane endocyto - sis , particularly when their Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain interactions with dynamin or actin are inhibited ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . These F - BAR protein - induced tu - bules in cultured cells 1 ) contain dynamin and known com - ponents of endocytosis ; 2 ) are transient ; and 3 ) are greatly elongated under conditions of dynamin or F - actin inhibition , suggesting a dynamic equilibrium between tubulation and membrane ﬁssion ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Despite the elegance of existing struc - tural , and cell biological analyses , the biological contexts in which F - BAR domain proteins function in vivo remain largely unknown . Here , we use genetic and cell biological approaches in Drosophila to analyze potential in vivo func - tions of syndapin , one of the best - known F - BAR proteins , conserved from insects to mammals ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ) . Syndapins / Pacsins , have C - terminal SH3 domains capa - ble of binding to proline - rich domains of dynamin , and two This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

To directly address the biological function of syndapin , we used the Drosophila larval neuro - muscular junctions , in which one can easily study the bio - genesis of a tubulolamellar postsynaptic membrane system termed the subsynaptic reticulum ( SSR ) ( Budnik et al . , 1996 ; Guan et al . , 1996 ; Albin and Davis , 2004 ) . Our results indicate that syndapin promotes formation of an endogenous tubu - lolamellar membrane system through a mechanism that re - quires both its F - BAR and SH3 domains and provides new insight into potential mechanisms and functions of F - BAR proteins in vivo . MATERIALS AND METHODS Fly Stocks and Culture Flies were maintained at 25°C unless otherwise stated . All stocks and crosses were grown in standard corn meal medium ( 83 g / l corn ﬂour , 50 g / l dextrose ; 25 g / l sucrose ; 18 g / l agar ; 15 g / l yeast ; 4 % ( vol / vol ) propionic acid ; 0 . 06 % ( vol / vol ) orthophosphoric acid and 0 . 07 % methyl - 4 - hydroxy benzene ) . Live yeast was later added to the vials or bottles of food . dlg m52 and dpak 11 were obtained from Vivian Budnik ( University of Massachusetts , Amherst , MA ) , and Larry Zipursky ( University of California Los Angeles , Los Angeles , CA ) , respectively . We conﬁrmed the previous observation that dpak 11 is a protein null at the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) ( Parnas et al . , 2001 ) . Dlg protein in dlg m52 mutants was severely reduced but is not a null allele ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) ( Mendoza et al . , 2003 ) . The isolation and characterization of synd mutant alleles has been described previously ( Kumar et al . , 2008 ) . Antibodies and Immunochemistry Wandering third instars were pinned dorsally on a Sylgard dish and dissected in cold calcium - free HL3 saline ( 70 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM trehalose , 115 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 ) to expose the neuromuscular junctions . Dissected larvae were then ﬁxed in 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 5 mM EGTA for 30 min , or in Bouin’s ﬁxative ( for glutamate receptor [ GluR ] IIA staining ) for 5 min . Larvae were then washed in PBS containing 0 . 15 % Triton X - 100 , blocked fo r 1 h in 5 % normal goat serum , and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody . Polyclonal anti - syndapin anti - bodies were raised in rat or rabbit against the N - terminal ( Synd (cid:1) SH3 , amino acids [ aa ] 1 – 377 ) of the protein . Afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - syndapin antibody was used at 1 : 50 dilution for immunostaining . The monoclonal antibodies anti - Dlg , anti - DGluRIIA , anti - CSP , and anti - spectrin were obtained from the De - velopmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ( Department of Biological Sciences , University of Iowa , Iowa University , IA ) and were used at 1 : 50 dilution . Anti - Wsp was a gift from Eyal Schejter ( Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot , Israel ) and was used at 1 : 200 dilution . Polyclonal anti - dPAK was a gift from Chihiro Hama ( National Institute of Neuroscience , Tokyo , Japan ) and was used at 1 : 500 dilution . Polyclonal rabbit anti - Dlg was a gift from Vivian Budnik and was used at 1 : 1000 dilution . Polyclonal anti - Syt was a gift from Hugo Bellen ( Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX ) and was used at 1 : 1000 , and anti - dynamin was used at 1 : 200 . Secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was used at 1 : 400 dilution . Stained larval preparations were mounted in VECTASH - IELD ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) and imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSM510 Meta ; Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Western Blotting Fly heads were homogenized in 1 (cid:2) SDS sample buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl , pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 2 % (cid:1) - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 1 % bromphenol blue , and 10 % glyc - erol ) , boiled for 5 min , and 2 ﬂy head equivalents of protein was fractionated on a 13 . 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The protein was trans - ferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane and blocked fo r 1 h in 5 % fat - free milk . The anti - syndapin antibodies were used at 1 : 10 , 000 dilutions . The horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - coupled secondary antibody ( GE Health - care , Chalfont St . Giles , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) was used at 1 : 50000 dilutions . Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence system . Cell Culture and Transfection Drosophila S2R (cid:3) cells were propagated in 1 (cid:2) Schneider’s Drosophila media ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U / ml penicillin , and 50 (cid:2) g / ml streptomycin in 75 - cm 2 T - ﬂasks ( Sarstedt , Rommelsdorfer Starbe , Germany ) at 25°C . Drosophila Schneider S2R (cid:3) cells ( 3 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were transiently cotransfected with pUAST constructs ( 1 . 1 (cid:2) g ) and Act5C - GAL4 DNA ( 0 . 6 (cid:2) g ) by using FuGENE reagent ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) as described previously ( Bogdan and Klambt , 2003 ) . For confocal spin - ning - disk imaging microscopy , cells were replated on chambered coverglass ( Nalge Nunc International , Rochester , NY ) pretreated with concanavalin A . Generation of Transgenic Flies The Synd Open Reading Frame was ampliﬁed using cDNA ( EST clone , LD46328 ) as template . The amplicon was cloned at EcoRI and NotI site in pUAST . The enhanced yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( EYFP ) - syndapin constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ampliﬁcation of various syndapin domains ( synd full - length , 1 - 494 aa ; synd FCH , 1 - 150 aa ; synd F - BAR , 1 - 300 aa ; and synd SH3 , 406 - 494 aa ) and cloned into Drosophila Gateway vector ( developed by Murphy laboratory , Carnegie Institution of Washington , Baltimore , MD ) . All constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing for the absence of any point mutations . For generating constructs with sub - stituted amino acids , site - directed mutagenesis was performed ( Mutagenex , Piscataway , NJ ) on the wild - type syndapin construct and cloned into pUAST vector . The embryonic transformation of Drosophila was performed by Genetic Services ( Cambridge , MA ) . Several transgenes harboring the construct were obtained and all of them expressed Synd protein at high levels . Electron Microscopy Third instar larval body muscles were dissected in cold Ca 2 (cid:3) - free HL3 me - dium . The samples were ﬁxed in Ca 2 (cid:3) - free Trump’s ﬁxative ( pH 7 . 2 , 4 % paraformaldehyde , 1 % glutaraldehyde , 100 mM cacodylate , 2 mM sucrose , and 0 . 5 mM EGTA ) in the dissection chamber for (cid:4) 30 min at room temper - ature . The segments A2 and A3 were dissected out and further ﬁxed over - night at 4°C . The samples were rinsed in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer with 264 mM sucrose , postﬁxed in 2 % osmium tetroxide , and stained en bloc during etha - nol dehydration with 2 % uranyl acetate . Muscles embedded in Araldite were sectioned at 60 nm . Sections stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and 1 % lead citrate were examined with a 100CX transmission electron microscope ( JEOL , Tokyo , Japan . Quantitation and Morphometric Analyses Fluorescence imaging was carried out using a laser scanning confocal micro - scope ( LSM510 Meta ; Carl Zeiss ) . All the control and experimental samples were processed in the same way , and the same setting was used for acquiring the images . Type I boutons were imaged at 63 (cid:2) , and the average ﬂorescence intensity of syndapin around boutons was calculated using MetaMorph soft - ware ( GE Healthcare ) . For calculation of SSR width and bouton area , NMJs labeled with anti - Synd and anti - HRP were imaged at 63 (cid:2) with zoom 4 on the confocal microscope , and the maximal intensity projection image was ob - tained . Although anti - HRP labels some extra bouton epitopes , the bouton boundary could be unambiguously identiﬁed under immunoﬂuorescence microscope . The SSR width was calculated as a difference between widths of total synapse ( bouton (cid:3) SSR ) across the bouton and the width of the bouton . Only type I boutons at muscle 6 / 7 from four or more animals were used for quantitation . For quantiﬁcation of SSR complexity , electron micrographs were printed at 25 , 000 (cid:2) and the number of membrane segments crossing a line of 0 . 5 (cid:2) m was manually counted . For each bouton , four to six measurements were taken , averaged , and expressed as membrane layers / micrometer . RESULTS Syndapin Is Localized to the Subsynaptic Reticulum and Promotes its Biogenesis In mammalian neurons , syndapin is predominantly local - ized to the postsynaptic dendritic spines where it regu - lates endocytosis of N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor sub - types ( Perez - Otano et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with these observations , Drosophila syndapin is predominantly postsyn - aptic at the Drosophila third instar larval neuromuscular junc - tion . At the postsynapse , it is tightly localized to the tubulola - mellar SSR ( Figure 1 , A – C ) . Synd strongly colocalizes with the actin - regulatory protein Wsp ( Figure 1 , D – F ) and is encircled by spectrin immunoreactivity ( Figure 1 , G – I ) , consistent with the prior observation that spectrin surrounds the SSR ( Pielage et al . , 2006 ) . Unlike Amphiphysin , syndapin is not visible in muscle T - tubules ( Razzaq et al . , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) ( Supple - mental Figure S1 ) . A strong enrichment of Synd in the SSR suggested a function in generating or organizing this highly tubulola - mellar postsynaptic membrane network . Thus , we asked whether loss or gain of Synd has any effect on SSR biogen - esis or morphology . Although loss - of - syndapin has no effect Syndapin - mediated Membrane Organization Vol . 20 , April 15 , 2009 2255 on the gross morphology of the SSR , as judged from Dlg immunostaining of control and synd loss - of - function NMJ ( Figure 2 , A – C ) , a role for Synd in SSR formation , was supported by observations made in gain - of - function NMJ . By using Tubulin promoter driven or mef2 driven Gal4 , we overexpressed a UAS - syndapin transgene either iniqui - tously or speciﬁcally in postsynaptic muscles . Ubiquitous or postsynaptic syndapin overexpression strongly increased syndapin immunoﬂuorescence around SSR - rich types I but not at SSR - poor type II or type III boutons ( Atwood et al . , 1993 ) ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Quantitative analysis indi - cated that the width of Synd - immunoreactive regions , which correlates with SSR expansion in the vicinity of boutons is increased about twofold after muscle expression , whereas bouton size remained unchanged ( Figure 2 , D – K ; Table 1 ) . In addition , UAS - synd ; mef2 - Gal4 larvae reared at 29°C , a tem - perature that allows more robust Gal4 - mediated expression , not only expanded syndapin - immunopositive regions at postsynaptic sites but also spread to ﬂanking “extrasynap - tic” zones that were bereft of presynaptic innervation in “ﬂares” of unique appearance ( Figure 2 , D – I ) . Further analyses revealed that regions of increased syn - dapin immunoreactivity were , in fact , expansions of subsyn - aptic reticulum . First , the membrane label FM1 - 43 clearly marks the expanded synaptic and extrasynaptic syndapin domains ( Figure 3 , A – C ) . Similar observations were made with alternative membrane stains , AM1 - 43 or postsynapti - cally expressed , membrane - targeted green ﬂuorescent pro - tein ( data not shown ) . We conﬁrmed the conclusion that syndapin induces SSR by using electron microscopy ( EM ) . In the wild - type larval NMJ ; boutons are surrounded by an extensive tubulolamel - lar infoldings of muscle membrane ( Figure 3D ) . Syndapin overexpression resulted in an obvious expansion of postsyn - aptic membrane similar in morphology but different com - plexity to the wild - type SSR ( Figure 3 , E and F ) . To quantify the SSR complexity , we counted the number of membrane Figure 1 . Syndapin localizes postsynaptically with Wsp at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction .

Bar , 15 (cid:2) m . Error bars represent SEM calculated using two - tailed t test . V . Kumar et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2256 layers per micrometer in control and syndapin - overexpress - ing NMJ . We found that the syndapin - overexpressing ani - mals have more complex SSR compared with wild - type controls ( 13 . 7 (cid:5) 1 . 6 membrane layers / micrometer for con - trols compared with 20 . 33 (cid:5) 1 . 8 membrane layers / micro - meter for Mef2 - Gal4 ; UAS - Syndapin , p (cid:7) 0 . 022 or 19 (cid:5) 1 . 23 membrane layers / micrometer for Tubulin - Gal4 ; UAS - Syn - dapin , p (cid:7) 0 . 023 ( Figure G ) . Furthermore , in addition to local expansion of postsynaptic SSR , EM revealed extensions of SSR along the muscle ﬁber , away from sites of presynaptic innervation ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . This is consistent with observations with lipophilic dyes , which also indicate that these extrasynaptic Synd domains contain dense mem - brane . Together , these data strongly suggests that overex - pression of syndapin , a normal component of the SSR , is sufﬁcient to speciﬁcally promote the biogenesis of an endog - enous , postsynaptic membrane system . In addition , these ﬁndings suggest that SSR can be induced (cid:7) 20 (cid:2) m distant from the site of presynaptic innervation . To test for any potential defect in synaptic transmission , we performed electrophysiological recording on NMJs overexpressing syn - dapin in muscles . We found that despite striking alterations in NMJ structure , these synapses function normally ( Supple - mental Figure S3 ) . Synaptic and Extrasynaptic Membrane Expansions Contain Native Markers of SSR We further asked whether key components of the native SSR were present in the expanded synaptic and extrasynaptic SSR observed after syndapin overexpression . Three of these proteins are Dlg , dPAK , and WASp . Dlg was present in both synaptic and extrasynaptic SSR , although at somewhat lower density in extrasynaptic re - gions ( Figure 4 , A – C ) . dPAK was also strongly recruited to the expanded SSR , being present not only in postsynaptic puncta but also in extrasynaptic regions bereft of presynap - tic terminals ( Figure 4 , D – F ) . In addition , Wsp immunore - activity was greatly increased around the boutons and strong immunoreactivity was observed in the extrasynaptic regions ( Figure 4 , G – I ) . Interestingly , postsynaptic gluta - mate receptor levels and distribution was not altered after SSR expansion . In the wild - type NMJ , GluR is present in a postsynaptic domain that excludes Synd ( Supplemental Fig - ure S2 ) . Synd overexpression does not alter the GluR con - taining domain , but speciﬁcally expands GluR free SSR ( Fig - ure 4 , J – L ) . In conclusion , a variety of optical and EM analyses of NMJ show that overexpression of Synd induces a striking expan - sion of SSR . Syndapin - mediated SSR Expansion Occurs in dlg and dpak Mutants The observation that Synd expands Dlg - and dPAK - contain - ing membranes suggested that Synd could recruit the sig - naling proteins dPAK and Dlg , which in turn induce SSR formation via a yet unknown pathway ( Lahey et al . , 1994 ; Parnas et al . , 2001 ; Albin and Davis , 2004 ) . An alternative model is that Synd , when appropriately targeted to postsyn - aptic sites , acts directly on the membrane to induce tubula - tion and SSR formation . This second model is more consis - tent with the in vitro activity of F - BAR proteins ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Genetic epistasis experiments to discriminate between these two models of Synd action showed that Synd could induce postsynaptic membrane expansions even in dlg m52 and dpak 11 mutants that show highly reduced SSR ( Figure 5 ) . Thus , these data argue for a mechanism in which Synd acts parallel to or downstream of Dlg and dPAK , perhaps di - rectly on membrane as suggested by recent studies of F - BAR family proteins . We tested a prediction of this alternative model . F - BAR - Membrane Interactions Are Required for SSR Expansion We ﬁrst asked whether Drosophila syndapin induced mem - brane tubulation in cultured cells as predicted by its homol - ogy to previously studied F - BAR proteins . We further asked whether this conserved ex vivo activity requires the pre - dicted protein domains and conserved amino acid residues . We then asked how these Synd variants affected SSR forma - tion in vivo . To test whether the cellular properties of Synd is con - served to other F - BAR domain proteins , we expressed EYFP - tagged domains of syndapin in S2 - cells and analyzed their ability to form tubules . As shown in Figure 6 , whereas full - length syndapin produced only weak tubulation , con - sistent with Itoh et al . , 2005 , the F - BAR domain ( 1 - 300 aa ) induced massive tubule formation in cultured cells . In con - trast , the FCH domain ( 1 – 150 aa ) or the SH3 domain ( 406 - 494 aa ) of syndapin had no visible effect on membrane tubulation . Sequence alignment of Synd with other F - BAR domains showed that positively charged residues in its N - terminal F - BAR domain predicted to interact with membrane phos - pholipids were highly conserved ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . Point mutations in these positively charged residues ( K63E , K64E , and R129E , K130E ) strongly compromised its ability to form tubules in S2 cells ( Figure 6B ) . Thus , Drosophila Synd interacts with and modiﬁes membranes ex vivo through conserved molecular mechanisms ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et Table 1 .

The errors are SEM calculated by two - tailed t test . Syndapin - mediated Membrane Organization Vol . 20 , April 15 , 2009 2257 al . , 2006 ) . We then asked how these syndapin variants af - fected Synd targeting and SSR formation in vivo . We generated transgenic ﬂies expressing deletion con - structs or selected mutant forms of Synd in postsynaptic muscle . Full - length EYFP - tagged Synd , which had weak tubulation effect in S2 cells , behaved identically to wild - type Synd in its localization and robust effect on SSR expansion ( Figure 7 , A – C and G – I ) . The Synd FCH ( 1 – 150 aa ) and Synd SH3 domains ( 406 – 494 aa ) were not targeted to the NMJ and had no effect on postsynaptic membrane morphology ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , the F - BAR domain ( 1 - 300 aa ) , although not efﬁciently targeted to the postsynapse , induced patches of dense membrane randomly distributed over the muscle surface ( Figure 7 , D – F and J – L ) . These data suggest that 1 ) membrane modeling activity of syndapin is con - tained in the F - BAR domain ; 2 ) Synd targeting to the postsynapse requires both its F - BAR and the SH3 domains ; and 3 ) in contrast to its effect on membrane tubulation in Figure 3 .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 2258 cultured cells , full - length Synd , when appropriately tar - geted , is capable of substantial membrane remodeling . To ask whether postsynaptic membrane expansions re - quire Synd – membrane interactions , we tested whether syndapin K63EK64E or syndapin R129EK130E mutants , defective in phospholipid binding , were capable of SSR expansion . Overexpression of these mutant transgenes at levels compa - rable with the control wild - type transgenes had no effect on synaptic or extrasynaptic SSR ( Figure 8 ) . Indeed , these mu - tant syndapins seemed to accumulate in the cytoplasm , con - sistent with a mechanism in which membrane binding is required for SSR retention ( or targeting ) of Synd . Thus , residues essential for the F - BAR domain to bind and tubu - late membranes in vitro are necessary for syndapin’s ability to expand the SSR . DISCUSSION Structural , cell biological , and in vitro studies of F - BAR domain proteins have contributed signiﬁcantly toward our molecular understanding of how these proteins interact with membranes and other endocytic proteins to generate mem - brane tubules ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Frost et al . , 2008 ; Takano et al . , 2008 ) . However , our knowledge of these proteins in vivo , in the multicellular context , remains very limited . Here , we provide an in vivo analyses of syndapin in the context of its role in the biogen - esis of subsynaptic reticulum , a unusual complex membrane system . We make three key observations on Drosophila syn - dapin : 1 ) we show that syndapin can promote formation of a tubulolamellar membrane system in vivo , 2 ) syndapin causes membrane remodeling that can occur without accom - panying membrane ﬁssion , and 3 ) syndapin promotes SSR expansion by using evolutionarily conserved amino acids in its F - BAR domain . We consider these three points in turn below . Syndapin Promotes SSR Expansion The SSR is a unique system of tubules and lamellae formed by extensive infoldings of the postsynaptic muscle mem - brane ; thus , in organization , they are quite different from the relatively simple F - BAR – induced membrane tubules de - scribed in cultured cells . The SSR surrounds large boutons at the Drosophila NMJ . Although , a role for signaling and scaf - folding proteins such as dPAK and Dlg has been demon - strated in the formation of SSR , mechanisms that underlie biogenesis of this complex membrane system are still poorly understood . Syndapin overexpression in muscle caused induction of synaptic and extrasynaptic membrane - dense subsynaptic re - ticulum , based on optical and electron microscopic analyses . In particular , EM sections of membrane structures induced by syndapin overexpression showed not only circular / ellip - tical proﬁles expected for tubules , but also longer parallel membrane proﬁles , suggesting sections through lamellae as indeed is seen for native SSR . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst demonstration that an F - BAR protein can promote the formation of lamellar membrane infoldings . The mechanism by which syndapin may promote lamella formation is un - clear , but it is likely that this arises from context speciﬁc interactions with other protein components of the SSR ( Shibata et al . , 2006 ; Gorczyca et al . , 2007 ) . Syndapin seems to induce SSR through mechanisms that are either downstream of , or independent of , dPAK and Dlg function . This is indicated by three observations . First , the syndapin immunoreactivity is signiﬁcantly reduced in dPAK and Dlg mutants ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Second , unlike Dlg that can induce SSR when expressed either pre - or postsynaptically , syndapin acts in a cell - autonomous manner in postsynaptic muscle . This could indicate either a function downstream of these signaling molecules or an entirely independent mechanism . The third observation is that although Synd - induced membrane is strikingly similar to the endogenous SSR in general appearance ; it has some notable differences from the endogenous SSR in structure and composition . Synd - induced SSR has more densely packed membranes ( (cid:4) 30 % more membrane layers per mi - crometer ) and also contains lower amounts of Dlg and dPAK than the endogenous SSR . Both of these differences could conceivably arise from limiting amounts of Dlg , dPAK or some other factor ( s ) required for the precise organization of the SSR ; however , our current data do not address this issue unequivocally .

The SSR remains normal in synd loss - of - function mutants . Although this Figure 6 . Tubulation effect of Drosophila syndapin and its mutants in S2 cultured cells .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 2262 F - BAR proteins are suggested by reports that different F - BAR proteins can coexist on a single tubule ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) . Although alternative models are tenable , we suggest that Synd has a role in SSR biogenesis in vivo based on four arguments . First , Synd is localized to the postsynaptic SSR and would therefore most simply be expected to have an SSR - related function . The observed expansion of the SSR is consistent with this premise . Second , full - length Synd over - expression does not cause random patches of SSR to be induced all over the muscle surface but rather causes local expansions as well as ﬂares that often seem to emanate from the existing SSR . Thus , the observed consequence of Synd overexpression seems to originate from sites to which Synd is normally targeted in vivo . Third , that Synd can promote formation of a unique , highly complex membrane system in vivo indicates that it participates in intricate processes that likely require the coordinated function of many different proteins . Finally , consistent with the previous argument , muscle expression of other Drosophila F - BAR domain pro - teins such as Nervous wreck ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) ( Supplemen - tal Figure S4 ) or Cip4 ( data not shown ) does not induce SSR expansion . Syndapin Decouples Membrane Tubulation and Fission for SSR Expansion In cultured cells , overexpression of F - BAR proteins induces transient , dynamin - containing plasma membrane tubules that are rapidly fragmented by dynamin - mediated mem - brane scission ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Here , tubulation can be decoupled from membrane ﬁssion only if either the SH3 domain is removed or if SH3 interacting molecules ( e . g . , dynamin ) are inhibited . A physiological de - coupling of membrane tubulation and ﬁssion activities has been shown previously for the N - BAR domain proteins , mouse Amphiphysin 2 and Drosophila Amphiphysin , during T - tubule formation ( Razzaq et al . , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) . Our observations suggest that similar physiological decoupling of the two activities—membrane deformation and mem - brane ﬁssion also occurs for the syndapin , an F - BAR domain protein . In support of this , we show that unlike synd , the mem - brane ﬁssion protein dynamin is not enriched in the SSR ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) ; this is different from strong colo - calization observed between dynamin and syndapin in tran - sient tubules in cultured cells . Furthermore , the presence of the dynamin - interacting SH3 domain does not inhibit syn - dapin’s ability to promote SSR formation . Thus , in contrast to prior observations in cultured cells , our data show that syndapin in vivo can 1 ) be present without accompanying dynamin and 2 ) can form stable membrane infoldings with - out need to experimentally inhibit SH3 domain interactions . Syndapin Uses Conserved Basic Amino Acid Residues to Promote SSR Expansion The mechanism by which syndapin promotes SSR formation is likely to require direct membrane interactions mediated by previously identiﬁed residues on the concave face of its F - BAR domain . Mutations in key residues on the concave face of the F - BAR domain , required for phospholipid bind - ing , block the ability of syndapin to induce SSR . Thus , mechanisms that underlie F - BAR protein’s ability to tubu - late membrane in vitro seem to be required for syndapin’s ability to expand the SSR . However , Synd - induced SSR for - mation requires additional events , including correct target - ing to the postsynapse , a function that requires the C - termi - nal SH3 domain . Although Synd lacking its SH3 domain is extremely efﬁ - cient at membrane tubulation / remodeling in S2 cells , this truncated protein is not postsynaptically targeted in muscle cells and is ineffective for SSR expansion . Thus , the SH3 domain of Synd must interact with targeting molecules that control syndapin’s postsynaptic localization . By extension , the targeting of other F - BAR domain proteins , which may be mediated by analogous SH3 domain interactions , could be important for their respective in vivo functions . A simple model explaining and summarizing our observation on syn - dapin is presented as Figure 9 . Could our observations on syndapin be relevant to the function of other F - BAR domain proteins ? The SSR has some similarity to plasma membrane specializations such as the demarcation membrane system of megakaryocytes , which give rise to platelet plasma membrane ( Tolhurst et al . , 2005 ) . It is conceivable that other F - BAR domain proteins will be found to be involved in the biogenesis of these or other complex membrane system . Further studies are required to understand the different processes involved in SSR biogen - esis and also to test the relevance of these ﬁndings to other members of the F - BAR protein family .

A simple model showing how syndapin expands SSR at NMJs . In in vivo and cell - cultures , the F - BAR domain of syndapin is sufﬁcient to induce membrane tubules . However , at the Drosophila neuromuscular junctions , the F - BAR as well as SH3 domains are required for proper targeting of syndapin to the NMJs . Once prop - erly targeted , syndapin is retained there and generates new tubu - lolamellar structures by a mechanism that involves F - BAR domain binding to the muscle membranes through its conserved positively charged residues . Other SSR - enriched proteins , which may poten - tially be targeted through syndapin’s SH3 domain interaction , may subsequently modify the tubulolamellar structures generated by syndapin .
