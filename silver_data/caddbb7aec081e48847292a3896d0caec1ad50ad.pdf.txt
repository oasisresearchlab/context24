Ligand binding induces intracellular signaling cascades but also internalization of the receptor , eventually resulting in its lysosomal degradation . However , endocytic trafficking of receptors often modulates their downstream signaling . We previously reported that internalization of PDGFR β occurs via dynamin - dependent and - independent pathways but their further molecular determinants remained unknown . Here we show that , in human fibroblasts expressing endogenous PDGFR β and stimulated with 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB , ligand – receptor uptake proceeds via the parallel routes of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) . CME involvesthe canonical AP2 complex as a clathrin adaptor , while CIE requires RhoA – ROCK , Cdc42 and galectin - 3 , the latter indicating lectin - mediated internalization via clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) . Although different uptake routes appear to be partly interdependent , they cannot fully substitute for each other . Strikingly , inhibition of any internalization mechanism impaired activation of STAT3 but not of other downstream effectors of PDGFR β . Our data indicate that multiple routes of internalization of PDGFR β contribute to a transcriptional and mitogenic response of cells to PDGF . KEY WORDS : Platelet - derived growth factor receptor β , PDGFR β , Platelet - derived growth factor BB , PDGF - BB , Endocytosis , Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 , STAT3 , Rho GTPase INTRODUCTION Ligand - activated receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) can be internalized by distinct pathways of endocytosis ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) . To date , the best - defined entry portal into mammalian cells is clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Within this route , cargo selected for internalization interacts with adaptor proteins , such as the heterotetrameric AP2 complex , and is included into forming clathrin - coated pits . Subsequent scission of nascent vesicles is performed by the large GTPase dynamin ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . In parallel , numerous pathways of clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) have been described . Although their exact classification is still a matter of debate , their common denominator is the involvement of actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Grassart et al . , 2008 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , cholesterol - and glycosphingolipid - dependent formation of plasma membrane domains is important for CIE , which may involve extracellular lectins to cluster cargo destined for internalization ( Johannes et al . , 2015 ) . Dynamin can mediate scission of some clathrin - free endocytic intermediates , but other CIE pathways are independent of its activity ( Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . Regardless of entry route ( CME or CIE ) , internalized RTKs are generally sorted to early endosomes from where they are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or targeted for degradation in lysosomes ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) . Endocytic trafficking of a given RTK can impinge upon its signal transduction in multiple ways . Firstly , the pathway and kinetics of receptor internalization may modulate its signaling activity . Secondly , the sorting to degradation or recycling determines the balance between termination and sustenance of signaling , respectively . Thirdly , compartmentalization of a receptor in different endosomal organelles may diversify its signaling output in time and space ( Gonnord et al . , 2012 ; Sigismund et al . , 2012 ; Miaczynska , 2013 ; Irannejad et al . , 2015 ; Villaseñor et al . , 2016 ) . Still , for most RTKs , the routes of endocytic trafficking and their impact on signaling remain poorly investigated . Platelet - derived growth factor receptor β ( PDGFR β ) is a RTK activated in vivo primarily by platelet - derived growth factor BB ( PDGF - BB ) , which is a disulfide bond - linked homodimer of two PDGF - B polypeptides . PDGFR β activation induces cell proliferation , migration and angiogenesis ( Heldin and Westermark , 1999 ; Andrae et al . , 2008 ) . Ligand binding , dimerization and autophosphorylation of PDGFR β initiates signaling pathways that involve , among other proteins , AKT proteins , extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) proteins , glycogen synthase kinase 3 β ( GSK3 β ) , phospholipase C γ ( PLC γ ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins ( Heldin and Westermark , 1999 ) . Moreover , ligand binding causes internalization and eventually lysosomal degradation of the receptor ( Nilsson et al . , 1983 ) . Importantly , PDGFR β bound to PDGF - BB remains active following internalization and may thus continue signaling from endosomes ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Initially , PDGFR β was described to follow CME for its internalization ( Nilsson et al . , 1983 ; Kapeller et al . , 1993 ) , although more recent reports also indicate a possible engagement of clathrin - independent mechanisms ( De Donatis et al . , 2008 ; Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) . However , the regulators and significance of PDGFR β uptake by CIE remained unknown . We previously demonstrated that PDGF - BB can be internalized via dynamin - dependent and - independent pathways , with dynamin activity being crucial for STAT3 activation to initiate cell proliferation ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we further characterize endocytic transport of PDGFR β in human fibroblasts and identify its molecular mediators . We demonstrate that CIE of PDGFR β requires the actin Received 4 May 2016 ; Accepted 5 December 2016 1 Laboratory of Cell Biology , International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology , Warsaw 02 - 109 , Poland . 2 Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden 01307 , Germany . 3 School of Biosciences , University of Birmingham , Birmingham B15 2TT , UK . * Deceased ‡ Author for correspondence ( miaczynska @ iimcb . gov . pl ) M .

However , independently of the route of internalization , intracellular accumulation of PDGFR β is necessary to fully activate STAT3 and induce expression of several PDGF target genes . These data argue that sustained STAT3 signaling from endosomal compartments contributes to the mitogenic response to PDGF . RESULTS PDGFR β is partly internalized by clathrin - dependent endocytosis which is required for STAT3 activation Our previous data demonstrated that internalization of ligand - stimulated PDGFR β in human fibroblasts was impaired but not completely blocked in the presence of dynamin inhibitors ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . This suggested that multiple pathways of endocytosis are responsible for PDGF - BB uptake . To extend these findings , we analyzed to what degree PDGFR endocytosis involved the classical regulators of CME , such as AP2 and clathrin heavy chain ( CHC , also known as CLTC ) . We used two independent siRNA sequences to deplete a μ 2 subunit of the AP2 complex ( AP2 μ 2 , also known as AP2M1 ) or CHC in CCD - 1070Sk human skin fibroblasts , which express high levels of endogenous PDGFR β . In parallel , we also knocked down dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) , to compare the effects of its depletion to the previously reported usage of dynamin inhibitors ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . Knockdown efficiencies of AP2 μ 2 , CHC or DNM2 were verified by western blotting ( Fig . S1A – C ) . Importantly , depletion of these proteins did not affect basal levels of PDGFR β protein ( Fig . S1A – C ) . Unless otherwise indicated , to quantify internalization of the receptor , cells were stimulated with PDGF - BB ( 50 ng / ml ) and fluorescently labeled transferrin ( 25 μ g / ml ) for up to 30 min , fixed , stained for PDGFR β and imaged . Confocal images were quantitatively analyzed using MotionTracking software ( Collinet et al . , 2010 ) to measure endosomal accumulation of PDGFR β and transferrin , the latter reflecting the activity of CME . Depletion of AP2 μ 2 , CHC or DNM2 inhibited endocytosis of PDGFR β on average by ∼ 50 % after 30 min of stimulation ( Fig . 1A , C , E ; Table S1 ) , observed consistently with all small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) oligonucleotides used . As expected , the inhibition of transferrin uptake in these cells was stronger , reaching 70 - 95 % ( Fig . 1B , D , F ; Table S1 ) . Knockdown of AP2 μ 2 was the most potent in reducing internalization of transferrin , possibly due to its more efficient depletion as compared to CHC or DNM2 ( Fig . S1A – C ) . Still , under the condition of an almost complete block of transferrin uptake ( > 95 % for siRNA AP2M1 _ 1 ) , internalization of PDGFR β was moderately decreased by only ∼ 50 % ( Fig . 1A , B ; Table S1 ) . These data confirm that clathrin - and AP2 - driven endocytosis partially mediates uptake of PDGFR β when stimulated by 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB , which represents a ligand dose that induces cell proliferation ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . These results further suggest that under these conditions , clathrin - independent pathways must operate in parallel to CME to ensure complete internalization of PDGFR β . Moreover , the effects of DNM2 depletion closely resemble the previously reported effects of dynamin inhibitors on PDGFR β endocytosis ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . The involvement of dynamin may reflect both its well - documented action in CME and in clathrin - independent but dynamin - dependent routes of PDGFR β internalization . Studies of endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) indicate that ligand concentration may affect the internalization route ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) . Specifically , low doses of EGF induce predominantly CME , while both CME and CIE are employed for EGF uptake at higher concentrations . In our experimental model , 10 ng / ml PDGF - BB was the lowest dose that induced quantifiable receptor internalization ( Fig . S1D ) . We therefore tested effects of depletion of AP2 μ 2 , CHC or DNM2 on PDGFR β internalization induced by 10 ng / ml PDGF - BB . Receptor uptake under these conditions was strongly inhibited ( by 77 – 93 % after 15 min of ligand addition ; Fig . S1E ; Table S2 ) , with transferrin internalization blocked to a similar extent ( 82 – 95 % inhibition ; Fig . S1F ) . These data confirm that , by analogy to EGFR , endocytosis of PDGFR β stimulated by lower doses of PDGF - BB occurs predominantly by CME . We further measured whether knockdown of CME components affected signal transduction downstream of ligand - stimulated PDGFR β . To this end , we employed a higher ( 50 ng / ml ) dose of PDGF , as lower concentrations of the ligand do not activate STAT3 ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . We observed that depletion of AP2 μ 2 and DNM2 reduced STAT3 phosphorylation induced by 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB ( Fig . 1G – I ) . Moreover , two out of three siRNAs against CHC also diminished STAT3 activation by PDGF - BB ( Fig . 1H ; Fig . S1I ) . In all these cases activation of PDGFR β itself , AKT , PLC γ or GSK3 β remained unchanged ( Fig . S1G – J ) . ERK1 and ERK2 ( ERK1 / 2 , also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1 , respectively ) kinases were not analyzed because they are constitutively active in CCD - 1070Sk cells and not further activated by PDGF - BB ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that clathrin - and dynamin - mediated internalization of PDGFR β is required specifically for full activation of STAT3 but not of other effectors of PDGF - BB signaling . Clathrin - independent endocytosis of PDGFR β is mediated by RhoA but not Rac1 To further verify involvement of clathrin - independent pathways in PDGFR β internalization , we tested the effect of perturbation of actin cytoskeleton , a common denominator of several CIE routes , on PDGFR β uptake . We thus analyzed internalization of PDGFR β in cells treated with latrunculin A , an inhibitor of actin polymerization . Indeed , PDGFR β endocytosis was reduced by ∼ 30 % as compared to DMSO - treated cells at 15 – 20 min of PDGF - BB stimulation , while uptake of transferrin was unperturbed ( Fig . S2A , B ; Table S3 ) . These results suggested that actin - mediated , clathrin - independent endocytic pathways participate in internalization of PDGFR β . Uptake via caveolae represents one of the CIE routes ( Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . However , we determined that colocalization between PDGFR β and caveolin - 1 was very limited in CCD - 1070Sk cells ( data not shown ) ; thus , caveolae were unlikely to account for the internalization of substantial amounts of the receptor . The Rho family of small G proteins regulates various aspects of actin dynamics in the cell . Moreover , Rac1 , RhoA and Cdc42 have been reported to participate in different pathways of CIE ( Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . We thus systematically investigated how interference with the levels and / or activity of these proteins affected PDGFR β internalization . To this end , we applied overexpression of GFP - tagged dominant - active or dominant - negative mutants of Rac1 , RhoA and Cdc42 , as well as their chemical inhibition and siRNA - mediated depletion . With regard to Rac1 , we did not observe any noticeable changes in PDGFR β endocytosis in cells expressing constitutively active ( Q61L ) or inactive ( T17N ) Rac1 mutants ( Fig . S2C ) . Inhibition of Rac1 activity with the NSC23766 compound ( Akbar et al . , 2006 ) did not affect PDGFR β internalization ( Fig . S2D ) , although it moderately reduced transferrin uptake ( Fig . S2E ) . Furthermore , NSC23766 did not alter PDGF - induced STAT3 activation ( Fig . S2F ) . These data argue against involvement of Rac1 in endocytosis and signaling of PDGFR β . Expression of RhoA mutants affected the endocytic trafficking of PDGFR β ( Fig . 2A ) . The presence of constitutively active ( Q63L ) 578 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2017 ) 130 , 577 - 589 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 191213 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e RhoA caused prolonged peripheral accumulation of PDGFR β - containing endosomes . As shown in Fig . 2A , at 20 min of PDGF - BB treatment , endosomes harboring PDGFR β and EEA1 were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of control cells . In RhoA - Q63L expressing cells , these endosomes were enriched in the vicinity of the plasma membrane , suggesting a possible defect in trafficking of the ligand – receptor complexes . Moreover , cells expressing an inactive RhoA - T19N mutant exhibited lower intracellular accumulation of PDGFR β , without major changes in the morphology or localization of early endosomes stained with EEA1 ( Fig . 2A ) . These observations suggested that RhoA may be potentially involved in PDGFR β endocytosis . To further verify these data , cells were treated with agents blocking the RhoA function : C3 toxin and Rhosin ( Narumiya et al . , 1988 ; Shang et al . , 2012 ) . Both inhibitors interfered with the uptake of PDGFR β . The amounts of internalized PDGFR β after 15 min of PDGF - BB treatment were reduced by 37±6 % by C3 toxin and by 40±8 % by Rhosin ( mean±s . e . m . ) , with a similar degree of inhibition observed for up to 30 min ( Fig . 2B ; Table S3 ) . Transferrin endocytosis was not significantly affected under these conditions ( Fig . 2C ; Table S3 ) . Cumulatively , these results suggested an involvement of RhoA but not Rac1 in the uptake of PDGFR β . Fig . 1 . PDGFR β internalizationandsignalingdependonAP2 , clathrinanddynamin2 .

To verify whether ROCK1 and ROCK2 ( hereafter ROCK1 / 2 ) are involved in PDGFR β internalization , we applied their two ATP - competitive , selective inhibitors Y - 27632 and H - 1152 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ; Tamura et al . , 2005 ) . Treatment of cells with both compounds reduced PDGFR β endocytosis without affecting transferrin internalization ( Fig . 2D , E ) . Specifically , at 15 min after ligand addition , PDGFR β internalization was decreased by 58±5 % and 38±14 % ( mean±s . e . m . ) by Y - 27632 and H - 1152 , respectively , as compared to control ( Fig . 2D ; Table S3 ) . To confirm the data obtained with ROCK inhibitors , internalization of PDGFR β and transferrin was monitored after siRNA - mediated knockdown of ROCK1 or ROCK2 . Depletion of these proteins did not affect basal levels of PDGFR β protein ( Fig . S3A , B ) or endocytosis of transferrin ( Fig . 2G ; Table S3 ) . However , cells with silenced expression of ROCK1 or ROCK2 showed decreased amounts of internalized PDGFR β ( Fig . 2F ; Table S3 ) , with a range similar to cells treated with ROCK inhibitors ( reduction of 35 – 55 % for individual siRNA oligonucleotides at 15 min after PDGF - BB addition ) . Cumulatively , these data established that interfering with the function of RhoA or ROCK1 / 2 impaired uptake of PDGF but not transferrin internalized by CME . We therefore conclude that RhoA and ROCK1 / 2 are involved in CIE of PDGFR β . We further analyzed whether interference with the function of ROCK1 / 2 affected PDGF - induced signaling . Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of ROCK1 or ROCK2 impaired activation of STAT3 ( Fig . 2H – J ) but not activation of AKT proteins , GSK3 β , PLC γ or PDGFR β itself ( Fig . S3C – E ) . A similar pattern of signaling was observed upon inhibition of CME ( Fig . 1G , H and Fig . S1G – I ) , suggesting that full STAT3 activation requires internalization of PDGFR β , and that this is independent of the specific uptake pathway . Cdc42 is required for clathrin - independent internalization of PDGFR β and PDGF - induced activation of STAT3 To test a possible involvement of Cdc42 in PDGFR β endocytosis , we analyzed how expression of Cdc42 mutants affected ligand - induced PDGFR β trafficking . In cells overexpressing a constitutively active Cdc42 - Q61L mutant , PDGFR β - and EEA1 - positive vesicles were enlarged and localized close to the plasma membrane even at 20 min after PDGF addition , while at this time point the receptor localized in the perinuclear region in control cells ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast , cells expressing an inactive Cdc42 - T17N mutant exhibited a decreased number of PDGFR β - positive endosomes , with no visible changes in the number or distribution of early endosomes marked with EEA1 ( Fig . 3A ) . These data suggested a possible involvement of Cdc42 in endocytosis of PDGFR β . As the next step , we treated cells with ML141 , a selective , non - competitive inhibitor of Cdc42 ( Surviladze et al . , 2010 ) . This treatment decreased PDGFR β internalization without affecting transferrin uptake ( Fig . 3B , C ) . At 15 min , Cdc42 inhibitor reduced PDGFR β endocytosis by 56±6 % ( mean±s . e . m . ) compared to cells treated with DMSO as a solvent control ( Table S4 ) . However , the inhibitory effect of ML141 on PDGFR β internalization was no longer significant at 30 min after addition of the ligand ( Fig . 3B ; Table S4 ) , suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism of uptake . To confirm a role of Cdc42 in PDGFR β endocytosis , CDC42 expression was silenced by RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Depletion of Cdc42 did not affect levels of PDGFR β ( Fig . S4A ) but impaired its endocytosis by ∼ 45 % at 15 min after addition of the ligand ( Fig . 3D ; Table S4 ) . In contrast to ML141 treatment , this degree of inhibition persisted at later time points ( 30 min after ligand addition ; Fig . 3D ; Table S4 ) . Importantly , Cdc42 knockdown did not alter transferrin internalization ( Fig . 3E ; Table S4 ) . These data indicate that Cdc42 is involved in CIE of PDGFR β , as with RhoA and ROCK1 / 2 . We then investigated how perturbation of PDGFR β endocytosis by ML141 or Cdc42 depletion correlated with PDGF - induced signaling . Consistently , both regimes reduced PDGF - dependent STAT3 phosphorylation ( Fig . 3F , G ) , without affecting the other components of PDGFR β signaling ( Fig . S4B , C ) . These results reinforce our conclusion about the requirement of PDGFR β internalization for full activation of STAT3 . Components of the CLIC and GEEC pathway , CD44 and galectin - 3 , take part in PDGFR β internalization Specific involvement of RhoA and Cdc42 in uptake of PDGFR β but not transferrin provided evidence for CIE of the receptor . We verified whether PDGFR β colocalized with known , widely expressed cargo molecules taken up by this mode of internalization , such as CD44 and CD98 ( a heterodimer of SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 ) ( Eyster et al . , 2009 ) . Endocytosis of these proteins can be stimulated by antibodies targeting their extracellular portions ( Eyster et al . , 2009 ) . We observed a 30 % colocalization between ligand - stimulated PDGFR β and internalized CD44 , starting from 10 min after addition of PDGF - BB and anti - CD44 antibody ( Fig . 4A , B ) . In contrast , the percentage of colocalization between vesicles harboring PDGFR β and CD98 was below 10 % ( Fig . 4A , B ) . In addition , CD44 colocalization with transferrin was below 10 % until 10 min of internalization ( Fig . 4C ) , suggesting that CD44 traffics through a different intermediate compartment to transferrin . After 15 min , CD44 colocalized more extensively with transferrin ( > 40 % ) , which could reflect its recycling back to plasma membrane via classical recycling endosomes along with transferrin receptor . In contrast , CD98 colocalized more extensively with transferrin even at early time points ( above 20 % at 10 min ; Fig . 4C ) . CD44 acts as a hyaluronan receptor , and is reported to interact with a number of signaling receptors , including PDGFR β ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ; Porsch et al . , 2014 ) . CIE of CD44 occurs via clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) ( Eyster et al . , Fig . 2 . RhoA and ROCK1 / 2 activities are required for PDGFR β internalization and PDGF - dependent signaling .

We thus verified whether CD44 and galectin - 3 are required for uptake of PDGFR β . Knockdown of CD44 ( Fig . S4D ) impaired both internalization of PDGFR β and transferrin ( Fig . 4D , E ; Table S5 ) , although an inhibition of PDGFR β uptake was more pronounced ( 63 % versus 30 % for siRNACD44 _ 1 , and 53 % versus 30 % for siRNACD44 _ 2 at 30 min after addition of the ligand ) . Of two siRNA targeting galectin - 3 ( GAL3 _ 1 , GAL3 _ 2 ) , one ( GAL3 _ 1 ) caused a marked changes in morphology of cells ( data not shown ) and was excluded from further analysis . Depletion of galectin - 3 using the other siRNA oligonucleotide ( GAL3 _ 2 ) decreased the amounts of internalized PDGFR β without affecting transferrin endocytosis ( Fig . 4F , G ; Fig . S4E , Table S5 ) . The involvement of galectin - 3 in PDGFR β endocytosis was confirmed by its depletion using two further siRNA oligonucleotides from another supplier ( GAL3 _ 3 and GAL3 _ 4 , Dharmacon ; Fig .

S4G ) . However , under these conditions , uptake of transferrin was also affected at 30 min after ligand addition ( Fig . S4H ; Table S5 ) . Cumulatively , the involvement of CD44 and galectin - 3 indicates that PDGFR β endocytosis can take place via the CLIC and GPI - enriched early endosomal compartment ( GEEC ) pathway . As galectin - 3 was described to have both extra - and intra - cellular functions ( Haudeket al . , 2010 ; Elola et al . , 2015 ) we verified whether addition of soluble recombinant galectin - 3 to galectin - 3 - depleted cells could rescue the observed defect in PDGFR β endocytosis . As shown in Fig . 4H , addition of 0 . 01 or 0 . 1 μ g / ml of His - tagged full - length galectin - 3 was able to partially rescue the PDGFR β internalization that was reduced by galectin - 3 knockdown . Consistent with previous observations ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) , a higher ( non - physiological ) dose of 1 μ g / ml galectin - 3 inhibited PDGFR β endocytosis even in control cells ( Fig . 4H ) . Importantly , addition of recombinant galectin - 3 did not affect transferrin internalization in control or galectin - 3 - depleted cells ( Fig . 4I ) . These data indicate that the function of galectin - 3 in PDGFR β endocytosis depends at least in part on its extracellular activity , which mediates receptor clustering as a prerequisite for formation of an endocytic carrier ( Johannes et al . , 2015 ) . Eventually , we assessed whether inhibition of PDGFR β uptake mediated by CD44 and galectin - 3 had a similar effect on PDGFR β signaling as depletion of other endocytosis regulators . Indeed , knockdown of CD44 or galectin - 3 reduced activation of STAT3 but not other signaling effectors ( Fig . 4J , K ; Fig . S4I , J ) . Different endocytic routes mediate PDGFR β internalization and PDGF - induced STAT3 activation Having established that multiple routes can mediate uptake of ligand - stimulated PDGFR β , we next tested how simultaneous knockdown of different CME and CIE components affected endocytosis of PDGFR β . To this end , we performed co - depletion of DNM2 with CHC ( Fig . 5A , B ) , ROCK2 ( Fig . 5C , D ) or galectin - 3 ( Fig . 5E , F ) , and measured internalization of PDGFR β and transferrin ( Tables S6 – S8 ) . As expected for transferrin internalized primarily via CME , co - silencing of DNM2 with other endocytic components did not inhibit transferrin uptake more than depletion of DNM2 alone ( Fig . 5B , D , F ) . In contrast , at 30 min of PDGF - BB stimulation , we observed an additive effect of co - silencing of DNM2 and CHC on PDGFR β uptake , when compared to single knockdowns of these proteins ( Fig . 5A ) . This could indicate that co - depletion of DNM2 and CHC reduced PDGFR β internalization by impairing both CME and dynamin - dependent CIE , consistent with our above results . However , we cannot formally exclude that a stronger decrease in PDGFR β internalization may be due to a more efficient inhibition of CME upon co - silencing of DNM2 and CHC than the one caused by single knockdowns . In turn , co - depletion of DNM2 with ROCK2 or with galectin - 3 showed no additive effects in inhibiting PDGFR β uptake ( Fig . 5C , E ) . In general , these data suggest existence of compensatory mechanisms , enabling internalization of the receptor at substantial levels even upon impairment of two potential uptake routes . We then investigated how double silencing of DNM2 with other endocytic components affected PDGF - induced signaling . In accordance with the results on PDGFR β uptake ( Fig . 5A ) , we observed an additive effect of DNM2 and CHC co - depletion which decreased STAT3 activation more than any of the single knockdowns ( Fig . 5G ) . Combination of DNM2 and ROCK2 depletion did not further alter STAT3 phosphorylation ( Fig . 5H ) , which matches the data on PDGFR β endocytosis ( Fig . 5C ) . However , co - silencing of DNM2 and galectin - 3 led to a stronger impairment of STAT3 activation than depletion of single proteins ( Fig . 5I ) , which is in contrast to the microscopy data showing no additive effects in decreasing PDGFR β uptake ( Fig . 5E ) . These results may suggest an additional , positive role of galectin - 3 in modulating STAT3 activation in response to PDGF - BB , independent of its function in regulating the rate of PDGFR β endocytosis . PDGF - induced gene expression is affected by inhibitors of PDGFR β internalization Our data suggested that PDGF - induced STAT3 activation required complete internalization of the receptor , independently of a specific uptake route . STAT3 acts as a transcription factor , regulating expression of several PDGF uptake genes , with MYC being one of key mediators of a mitogenic response ( Bowman et al . , 2001 ; Jones and Kazlauskas , 2001 ) . We previously showed that inhibition of dynamin activity reduced MYC expression , downstream of STAT3 activated by PDGF - BB ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . We now investigated whether inhibition of ROCK1 / 2 or Cdc42 activity , required for CIE of PDGFR β , affected expression of MYC and other PDGF target genes . To avoid prolonged exposure of cells to pharmacological inhibitors and thus to reduce their unspecific effects , cells were stimulated by pulses of PDGF - BB in the presence of a particular inhibitor , instead of continuous treatment with the ligand . Short pulses of PDGF - BB ( 30 – 60 min ) have been reported to induce DNA synthesis as efficiently as continuous presence of the ligand for 8 h ( Jones and Kazlauskas , 2001 ) , and we applied such a pulse - stimulation regime in our previous study ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . We first selected a set of 11 known ( Bowman et al . , 2001 ; Vij et al . , 2008 ) or predicted ( using MotifMap ; Daily et al . , 2011 ) STAT3 target genes of which expression was induced upon pulse - stimulation with PDGF - BB , at different chase time points ( 60 – 240 min ) . The expression profiles of these genes upon PDGF pulse induction varied considerably , being early or late , and transient or persistent ( Fig . 6A – I ; Fig . S4K , L ) . We then measured whether expression of these genes changed upon pulse stimulation with PDGF - BB in the presence of dynasore , Y - 27632 or ML141 ( inhibiting dynamin , ROCK1 / 2 or Cdc42 , respectively ) . We observed different patterns of alterations in 9 of 11 genes , while expression of RELB and JUNB was not affected by any inhibitor ( Fig . S4K , L ) . Expression of MYC and IL8 , which are the best established and experimentally verified targets of PDGF - induced STAT3 activity , were equally reduced by all three inhibitors ( Fig . 6A , B ) . Similar effects were observed for EGR1 and EGR3 ( Fig . 6D , F ) . Expression of EGR2 and FOSL1 was preferentially inhibited by dynasore ( Fig . 6E , H ) , while expression of HBEGF was preferentially inhibited by Y - 27632 ( Fig . 6C ) . However , in some cases , the impact of inhibitors varied depending on the time point of measurement ( e . g . EGR2 in Fig . 6E ; FOSB in Fig . 6G ; ATF3 in Fig . 6I ) . This suggests that the expression pattern of a given target gene may be differently sensitive to a particular inhibition in the course of time , likely due to several other transcription factors binding to their promoters beside STAT3 . PDGF - induced DNA synthesis is impaired by inhibitors of CIE We previously showed that inhibition of dynamin activity , which impaired PDGFR β endocytosis and STAT3 activation , caused weaker induction of DNA synthesis , as a part of mitogenic response to PDGF - BB ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 ) . We now verified whether interference with activity of regulators of CIE affected the mitogenic response to PDGF - BB . When we treated serum - starved cells with PDGF - BB for 1 h in the presence of a solvent control , the percentage of cells undergoing DNA synthesis ( measured by BrdU incorporation after 24 h ) was increased by about threefold 584 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2017 ) 130 , 577 - 589 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 191213 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Fig . 5 . Different endocytic routes mediate PDGFR β internalization and PDGF - induced STAT3 activation .

Under similar conditions , stimulation of cells with 10 % serum for 1 h caused an insignificant , less than twofold , induction of DNA synthesis . When the pulse of PDGF - BB was administered in the presence of ROCK inhibitors Y - 27632 and H - 1152 or in the presence of Cdc42 inhibitor ML141 , induction of DNA synthesis was reduced by ∼ 50 % ( Fig . 6J ) . These data suggest that inhibition of ROCK1 / 2 and Cdc42 , which impairs PDGFR β internalization by CIE and STAT3 activation , correlate with diminished PDGF - induced mitogenic response . DISCUSSION In this study , we report that ligand - induced internalization of PDGFR β can occur via multiple endocytic pathways , and we characterize their selected molecular determinants . We demonstrate that in human fibroblasts expressing endogenous PDGFR β and stimulated with 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB , uptake of this receptor proceeds via parallel routes of CME and CIE . In turn , CME represents a predominant uptake route of PDGFR β when cells are stimulated with lower doses of the ligand ( 10 ng / ml ) , similar to as reported for EGFR ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) . CME of PDGFR β involves the canonical AP2 complex as a clathrin adaptor and dynamin as a scission - mediating molecule . Inactivation of AP2 - dependent CME in cells treated with 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB decreased uptake of PDGFR β by ∼ 50 % , suggesting that residual entry of the receptor proceeded via CIE . Thus , our data clearly demonstrate existence of clathrin - independent entry routes for PDGFR β which , however , cannot provide a full compensation for the lack of CME . Through dissection of the molecular machinery of CIE mediating PDGFR β uptake , we confirmed the requirement for actin cytoskeleton and the selective involvement of RhoA and Cdc42 but not Rac1 . The participation of RhoA and Cdc42 suggests that CIE of PDGFR β may proceed via more than one mechanism . The activity of Cdc42 is known to be required for the CLIC and GEEC route ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Francis et al . , 2015 ) . This pathway mediates uptake of CD44 as a typical cargo molecule and involves galectin - 3 as an extracellular clustering adaptor that drives the formation of endocytic intermediates ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) . We found both CD44 and galectin - 3 to be involved in uptake of PDGFR β . Interestingly , the impairment of endocytosis of PDGFR β upon depletion of galectin - 3 could be partially rescued by addition of recombinant galectin - 3 , suggesting that the extracellular pool of this protein participates in clustering and uptake of PDGFR β by CIE Fig . 6 . Activities of dynamin , ROCK1 / 2 and Cdc42 contribute to PDGF - induced transcriptional and mitogenic response . ( A – I ) PDGF - induced gene expression requires functional dynamin , ROCK1 / 2 and Cdc42 . Expression of nine PDGF - BB target genes ( indicated above graphs ) was measured by qRT - PCR upon treatment with inhibitors of dynamin ( dynasore ) , ROCK1 / 2 ( Y - 27632 ) , Cdc42 ( ML141 ) or DMSO and stimulation with PDGF - BB .

In case of CD44 , its interaction with PDGFR β was previously described to regulate receptor signaling ( Li et al . , 2006 ; Misra et al . , 2006 ; Porsch et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , PDGFR β was identified as an interacting partner of galectin - 3 , similarly to CD44 ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the associations between galectin - 3 , CD44 and PDGFR β could mediate incorporation of the receptor into the forming CLIC structures for subsequent uptake . Overall , the involvement of Cdc42 , galectin - 3 and CD44 strongly argues that the CLIC and GEEC pathway contributes to PDGFR β internalization . The function of RhoA and its downstream effectors ROCK1 / 2 in endocytosis of PDGFR β is more difficult to interpret . RhoA was reported to act in fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) , a recently characterized CIE pathway that mediates uptake of ligand - induced GPCRs and RTKs , including PDGFR ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ; Renard et al . , 2015 ) . However , FEME was described to depend also on the activity of Rac1 , and we did not observe the effect of Rac1 inhibition on PDGFR β internalization in our study , possibly due to cell type - specific differences . Based on our data and the published results ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) , it is nevertheless likely that FEME is involved in uptake of PDGFR β , as another CIE mechanism operating in parallel to the CLIC and GEEC pathway . While FEME requiresthe activity of dynamin for scission of endocytic intermediates , the CLIC and GEEC pathway is independent of it . The impaired internalization of PDGFR β that we observed upon dynamin depletion or inhibition of its activity ( Sadowski et al . , 2013 and this study ) could result from the involvement of dynamin in both CME and FEME of the receptor . Based on our data , we cannot estimate the exact proportions of PDGFR β that is internalized via different uptake routes under unperturbed conditions . We observed that interfering with the components of CME , Cdc42 or RhoA – ROCK caused in each case a substantial reduction in PDGFR β internalization . On the one side , this indicates that when one uptake mechanism is dysfunctional , the other ( s ) cannot fully compensate for it , otherwise impairment in PDGFR β endocytosis would not be observed . On the other side , partial functional compensation must operate between individual uptake pathways , as indicated by our data on co - depletion of CME and CIE components . We expected that such attempts should strongly and additively inhibit internalization of PDGFR β . However , we could only achieve this to a moderate degree by simultaneous knockdown of DNM2 along with CHC , but not with ROCK2 or galectin - 3 . It was reported that only very efficient depletion of CHC or DNM2 caused strong inhibition of EGFR uptake , while transferrin endocytosis was impaired even upon less efficient knockdown ( Huang et al . , 2004 ) . It is therefore possible that in our hands the extent of protein depletion was insufficient ( particularly in case of technically difficult double knockdowns ) to observe stronger inhibition of PDGFR β endocytosis . We nevertheless favor the view that the homeostatic mechanisms of the cell act to rescue defects in one uptake mechanism by increased cargo flow along other routes . Such global co - regulation of cellular entry pathways may be facilitated by some shared components . The actin cytoskeleton could represent one of them , as beside CIE it also contributes to CME , depending on the cell type and cargo ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Mooren et al . , 2012 ) . Still , our data argue that the entry routes of PDGFR β are not fully interchangeable . By comparison , internalization of EGFR upon stimulation with 100 ng / ml EGF was reported to occur with ∼ 60 % via CME and ∼ 40 % via CIE ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . While it is unclear which mechanisms sort the receptor towards CME or CIE , it is possible that certain regions of the cell may favor particular routes , e . g . FEME and CLIC were postulated to occur preferentially at the leading edges of migrating cells ( Howes et al . , 2010 ; Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) . With respect to PDGFR β signaling , we found no evidence for a particular internalization mechanism being linked to the activation of one specific pathway or to transcriptional induction of a specific set of PDGF target genes . A number of signaling effectors of PDGFR β , such as AKT proteins , PLC γ or GSK3 β , were not affected by inhibiting CME or CIE . Interestingly , activation of STAT3 was prominently impaired by interfering with any endocytic components that reduced PDGFR β internalization . This clearly indicates that PDGFR β endocytosis , independently of the exact uptake route , is required for full activation of STAT3 . This is consistent with the notion that sustained STAT3 activation occurs in part from endosomes , after PDGFR β internalization . The presence of phosphorylated STAT3 on endosomes was previously reported in cells stimulated with other growth factors ( EGF , hepatocyte growth factor ) or cytokines ( interleukin - 6 ) ( Bild et al . , 2002 ; Kermorgant and Parker , 2008 ; German et al . , 2011 ) . Our data suggest that the overall amount of ( likely phosphorylated ) PDGFR β on endosomes specifies the level of STAT3 activation and the subsequent mitogenic response to PDGF - BB . In case of internalized EGFR , it was shown that cells maintain a constant mean amount of phosphorylated EGFR per endosome , which is important for determining the amplitude and duration of signaling , and for subsequent cell fate specification ( Villaseñor et al . , 2015 ) . In our system , full STAT3 activation could also be viewed as a detector of the integrity of the endocytic pathway . Defects in any of the internalization mechanisms , reducing the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 , would be restrictive for cell cycle progression . Cumulatively , our results reinforce the notion that internalization and endosomal compartmentalization regulate the signaling of the activated growth factor receptors in space and time .
