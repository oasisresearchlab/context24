Letourneau 1 , 2 1 Departments of Neuroscience and 2 Graduate Program in Neuroscience , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 During development extrinsic guidance cues modulate the peripheral actin network in growth cones to direct axons to their targets . We wanted to understand the role of the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 in growth cone actin dynamics and guidance . Since growth cones migrate in association with diverse adhesive substrates during development , we probed the hypothesis that the functional significance of Arp2 / 3 is substrate dependent . We report that Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a reduction in the number of filopodia and growth cone F - actin content on laminin and L1 . However , we found substrate - dependent differences in growth cone motility , actin retrograde flow , and guidance after Arp2 / 3 inhibition , suggesting that its role , and perhaps that of other actin binding proteins , in growth cone motility is substrate dependent . Key words : actin ; Arp2 / 3 ; growth cone ; guidance ; L1 CAM ; laminin Introduction Developing axons are led by their terminal growth cones to the sites where they establish synaptic connections . Extrinsic guid - ance cues regulate the cytoskeletal machinery , particularly actin filaments , of growth cones to direct them toward their targets . Consequently , proper growth cone actin dynamics are crucial to correctly wire the nervous system ( Bentley and Toroian - Raymond , 1986 ; Lanier et al . , 1999 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ; Gomez and Letourneau , 2013 ) . Arp2 / 3 is a frequently studied actin binding protein ( ABP ) and regulator of actin dynamics ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . This multiprotein complex binds to the side of a pre - existing actin filament and nucleates an actin branch ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . This branched actin network has been implicated in numerous processes in non - neuronal cells ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) , most commonly associated with lamellipodial formation and protrusion ( Suraneni et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ) , though not all reports agree ( Di Nardo et al . , 2005 ) . Arp2 / 3 is also re - quired for haptotaxis in fibroblasts , but not chemotaxis ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) ; although , other groups have shown it is required for chemotaxis ( Mukai et al . , 2005 ; Suraneni et al . , 2012 ) . Addition - ally , Arp2 / 3 appears to influence filopodial numbers in cells ( Ma - chesky and Insall , 1998 ; Svitkina et al . , 2003 ) , but not always ( Sigal et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , it is linked to endocytosis and vesicular trafficking ( Merrifield et al . , 2004 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ) . Last , Arp2 / 3 interacts with vinculin and FAK ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Serrels et al . , 2007 ) , influences integrin - based adhesions in fibroblasts ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) , and promotes efficient cell adhe - sion between immune system cells ( Butler and Cooper , 2009 ) . The role of Arp2 / 3 in growth cone actin dynamics and guid - ance is unclear . Initially , Arp2 / 3 was considered unnecessary for filopodial formation , actin organization in veils and in veil pro - trusion , and as a negative regulator of axon elongation , although guidance defects were reported when Arp2 / 3 was inhibited ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ) . Later , Arp2 / 3 was reported to regulate fil - amentous actin ( F - actin ) content , veil protrusion and stability , and filopodial formation in growth cones ( Korobova and Svit - kina , 2008 ; Spillane et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , Arp2 / 3 inhibition in Caenorhabditis elegans causes deficient axon guidance ( Shakir et al . , 2008 ; Norris et al . , 2009 ) . From these reports , Arp2 / 3 role in growth cone migration is still uncertain . We believe these discrepancies reflect different neuronal systems and in vitro conditions . Growth cone morphology , behavior , and intracellular pro - cesses are influenced by the underlying substrate ( Burden - Gulley et al . , 1995 ; Liu et al . , 2002 ) . We used two naturally occurring substrates that have profound effects on growth cone morphol - ogy and behavior : the extracellular matrix protein laminin and the cell adhesion molecule ( CAM ) L1 . On laminin , axons extend with compact filopodial growth cones , while on L1 growth cones are broad and lamellar . These differences could reflect influences that substrates have on ABPs in growth cones . Adhesion mole - cules are capable of signaling intracellularly and , therefore , influ - encing the activity of ABPs ( Kamiguchi and Lemmon , 1997 ; Giancotti and Ruoslahti , 1999 ) . Consequently , growth cone de - pendency on any given ABP could be determined by the sub - strate .

Coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted with SlowFade ( Invitrogen ) and sealed . Time - lapse microscopy , fluorescent quantification , and morphometric analysis . Image acquisition settings were held constant for the different groups within a particular experiment , and images were obtained in one session . All images were obtained using an Olympus XC - 70 inverted microscopeequippedwithaCapitalQcameracontrolledbyMetaMorphsoftware ( Molecular Devices ) , unless otherwise noted . Quantification of fluorescence intensity was done by measuring the integrated signal in the distal 40 (cid:3) m of the growth cone . Growth cone areas were obtained by thresholding of phalloidin - stained images and tracing growth cone out - lines . Numbers of filopodia were obtained from phalloidin - labeled growth cones , and the number of filopodia per growth cone counted and divided by the growth cone perimeter length . This number was then expressed as the number of filopodia per 100 (cid:3) m of growth cone perim - eter .

This protocol has been described in detail previ - ously ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ) . Growth cone turning assay . This method was described previously ( Marsick et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . Briefly , glass micropipettes were coated with 5 % nitrocellulose in amyl acetate . These were then dipped in 1 (cid:3) g / ml NGF in PBS for 3 min . The coated micropipette was lowered into a video dishwithamicromanipulatorandplaced (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) mawayfromthecentral domain of a growth cone at a 45° angle , relative to the neurite axis . Growth cones were imaged every 30 s . Turning responses were measured as the change in direction in growth cone migration after 45 min of presenting the NGF - coated micropipette . Protein loading . The WASP VCA domain peptide was acquired from Cytoskeleton ( VCG03 - A ) andreconstitutedaccordingtomanufacturer’s specifications . TheVCApeptidewascomplexedwiththeChariotreagent from Active Motif , based on manufacturer’s specifications . After trying several ratios of the two components , we found that for our experiments the best concentrations were 4 (cid:3) g Chariot (cid:5) 3 (cid:3) VCA - GST incubated at room temperature for 30 min . The complex was then delivered into growth cones from an immobilized nitrocellulose - coated pipette , as de - scribed ( see above , Growth cone turning assay ) . Stripe assay . Coverslips were dipped in a 0 . 5 % 3 - aminopropyl - trimethoxysilane solution in H 2 O dd for half an hour , washed three times for 5 min in H 2 O dd , then air dried in a laminar flow hood , and coated with 5 % nitrocellulose in amyl acetate . Silicon molds for the stripes were attached to the coverslips . The solution that passed through the channels was composed of 20 (cid:3) g / ml ephrin A2 - Fc and 10 (cid:3) g / ml goat anti - Fc , diluted in either 20 (cid:3) g / ml laminin or 4 (cid:3) g / ml L1 . A total volume of 250 (cid:3) l of solution was passed though each silicon matrix over a period of 1 h . Atthispoint50 (cid:3) lofPBSwaspassedthroughthechannelstoremoveany unbound protein and the matrices were removed from the coverslips . Laminin ( 20 (cid:3) g / ml in PBS for 20 min ) or L1 ( 4 (cid:3) g / ml in PBS for 1 h ) was then applied to the entire coverslip . E7 temporal retina stripes were then plated over the stripes and grown for 16 h . Next morning , 50 % of the media was replaced and either DMSO or 50 (cid:3) M CK666 was added to the cultures and allowed to grow for another 24 h . At this point , the cultures were fixed , blocked , stained with anti - ephrin A2 and anti - (cid:2) 3 tubulin antibody , and imaged . 5896 • J . Neurosci . , April23 , 2014 • 34 ( 17 ) : 5895 – 5908 SanMiguel - RuizandLetourneau • Arp2 / 3RoleinGrowthConesIsSubstrateDependent Results L1 as a substrate The glycoprotein L1 is a homophilic binding CAM important for neurite growth , axon fasciculation and guidance , and synapse formation ( Nakamura et al . , 2010 ) . As an in vitro substrate it promotes the formation of broad lamellar growth cones in E7 DRG or RGC neurons ( Fig . 1 a , f , h ) . These growth cones have broad , thin peripheral domains ( P - domain ) that are periodically subdivided by filopodia . These subdivisions are known as lamel - lipodial veils and are dependent on Arp2 / 3 function ( Korobova and Svitkina , 2008 ) . Arp2 / 3 at the leading edge To understand its role in actin dynamics and guidance , we first asked where Arp2 / 3 was localized in our growth cones . We per - formed immunostaining against two subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex , p34 and Arp3 . Consistent with previous reports , wide - field microscopy showed the p34 subunit to be localized at the central domain ( C - domain ) and at the leading edge of growth cones ( Fig . 1 a , b ) . However , when we used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to image the cytoplasm near the substrate , most of the C - domain staining was eliminated , but not the anti - p34 staining at leading edge ( Fig . 1 a – e ) . Imaging of the Arp3subunitthroughwide - fieldandTIRFmicroscopyrevealeda homogeneous staining pattern along the P - domain and the lead - ing edge of growth cones ( Fig . 1 f , g ) , without any enrichment in the C - domain . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 is closely asso - ciated with the substrate at the leading edge , where we also found L1 to be enriched in the plasmalemma by TIRF microscopy ( Fig . 1 h – j ) . Interestingly , Arp2 / 3 was shown to bind focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and vinculin and be recruited to nascent integrin adhesions to couple actin polymerization to adhesion formation ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Serrels et al . , 2007 ) . It is unknown if Arp2 / 3 is also recruited to L1 adhesions , but the colocalization of Arp2 / 3 with L1 makes it well suited to mediate actin polymerization at the leading edge and promote its protrusion . Arp2 / 3 influences leading edge protrusion , motility , and axon elongation Actin polymerization is essential for driving growth cone leading edge protrusion ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ; Gomez and Letourneau , 2013 ) . Therefore , we sought to investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 during leading edge protrusion on L1 in response to NGF stim - ulation . NGF is an attractive guidance cue for DRG neurons dur - ing development and a potent stimulator of actin polymerization in vitro . We made time - lapse videos of DRG growth cones during NGF stimulation to analyze leading edge behavior with kymo - graphs , either using 50 (cid:3) M CK666 to inhibit Arp2 / 3 or DMSO as a vehicle control ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) . We found that CK666 sig - nificantly reduced the average leading edge protrusion after NGF stimulation for 5 min . ( Fig . 2 a – i ) . Yet , more revealing than the reduction in protrusion during Arp2 / 3 inhibition was the dy - namic leading edge behavior . Shortly after initial NGF stimula - tion , the leading edge of CK666 - treated growth cones would protrude but , arbitrarily , individual lamellipodial veils would collapse and retract toward the C - domain of the growth cone ( Fig . 2 g , h , yellow arrows ) . Yang et al . ( 2012 ) reported similar observations . At this point , the veil would remain collapsed or start protruding after a brief pause . A plausible explanation for veil collapse during Arp2 / 3 inhibition is the reduced number of actin branches at the leading edge , thus leaving a weakened actin network to abut against and resist the rearward membrane ten - sion at individual veils . It has also been reported that retracting veils have a lower density of actin branches that protruding veils ( Mongiu et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , this experiment suggests that Arp2 / 3 is necessary for the protrusion and stability of the growth cone leading edge after NGF stimulation on L1 . Leading edge protrusion is associated with growth cone mo - tility and axon elongation . Because Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced leading edge protrusion on L1 , we asked whether it would affect growth cone motility . We did time - lapse microscopy of growth cones treated either with DMSO or CK666 . We found that CK666 - treated growth cones had a 30 % reduction in their migra - tion velocity over a 1 h period , compared with DMSO - treated growth cones ( Table 1 ) . Consistent with this result , overnight inhibition of Arp2 / 3 led to axon lengths that were 60 – 75 % those of control axons , either with CK666 or by expression of the dominant - negativeconstructEGFP - CA ( Table1 ) . Thisconstruct codes for the CA peptide , which has been shown to prevent Arp2 / 3 activation by WASP / Scar proteins ( Hu¨fner et al . , 2001 ; Strasser et al . , 2004 ) . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 inhibition Figure1 .

Arp2 / 3 , barbed ends , actin polymerization , and numbers of filopodia Leading edge protrusion is driven by mo - nomeric actin incorporation onto free F - actin barbed ends . We wanted to know what effect Arp2 / 3 inhibition would have on the formation and availability of free barbed ends in growth cones on L1 . To this end , we used a barbed - end quantifi - cation assay , using DMSO or CK666 ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ; Marsick and Letour - neau , 2011 ) . Briefly , growth cones were pretreated with DMSO or CK666 for 4 h , stimulated with NGF for 4 min , perme - abilized , bathed in a Rhodamine - actin solution , washed , fixed , and Rhodamine - actin incorporation was quantified . We found that in DMSO - treated growth cones NGF stimulation led to a large increase in Rhodamine - actin incorpora - tion at the leading edge , and that the Rhodamine - actin label would colocalize with Alexa 488 phalloidin staining ( Fig . 2 j – n ) , thus , suggesting that the labeled ac - tin had been incorporated into actin fila - ments . Similar results were published recently ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . On the other hand , NGF stimulation caused very little Rhodamine - actin incorporation into CK666 - treatedgrowthcones ( Fig . 2 j , m , n ) . Thisexper - iment shows that most barbed ends created afterNGFstimulationonL1arelocatedattheleadingedgeandaredependentonArp2 / 3 . Given that Arp2 / 3 inhibition substan - tially reduced barbed - end numbers on L1 , we investigated the effect it would have on total F - actin after NGF or Netrin stimula - tion . Netrin is a potent stimulator of actin polymerization and a chemoattractant ( de la Torre et al . , 1997 ; Marsick et al . , 2010 ) in the guidance of RGC axons from the retina into the optic nerve head ( Deiner et al . , 1997 ) . We inhibited Arp2 / 3 in DRG or retina explants with CK666 for 4 h before experiments or by overnight expression of the dominant - negative con - struct EGFP - CA . We applied global stim - ulation of NGF ( DRG ) , Netrin ( RGC ) , or media as a control to growth cones for 15 min , fixed , stained with Alexa 568 phalloi - din , and quantified phalloidin fluorescent intensity . We found that in control condi - tions NGF or Netrin stimulation caused a large increase in the total F - actin content in growth cones ( Fig . 3 a , b , e – g ) . These growth cones also increased their surface area and acquired a lamellar morphology with an intense fringe of F - actin close to the leading edge ( Fig . 3 a , b , h ) . On the other hand , Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones had a small increase in F - actin content and surface area after NGF or Netrin treatment ( Fig . 3 c – h ) . Moreover , they no longer had a lamellar morphology . These results further rein - force our findings that Arp2 / 3 is an important mediator of actin polymerization in growth cones on L1 . Moreover , Arp2 / 3 activa - tion promotes the protrusion and expansion of the leading edge . Arp2 / 3 has been linked to filopodial formation in non - neuronal cells and growth cones ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Korobova and Svitkina , 2008 ) . The mechanism was coined the Figure2 .

We asked whether Arp2 / 3 influences numbers of filopodia in growth cones on L1 . Thus , we counted filopodial numbers in DRG growth cones treated with DMSO or CK666 , with and without NGF stimulation . We found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced the extent to which NGF stimulation increased filopodial numbers in growth cones ( Fig . 3 i ) . This finding suggests that Arp 2 / 3 activity contributes to the stimulus - dependent increase in the number of filopodia in growth cones after NGF stimulation . Arp2 / 3 and actin retrograde flow Actin retrograde flow is controlled by three main factors : ( 1 ) myosin II activity pulling F - actin back from the leading edge ( Lin et al . , 1996 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) ; ( 2 ) elongating actin filaments that push on the membrane at the leading edge , resulting in in - creased membrane tension , which pushes back on the growing filaments , adding to the retrograde flow of the actin network ; ( Henson et al . , 1999 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ; Craig et al . , 2012 ) ; and finally ( 3 ) linkage of actin filaments to substrate adhesions that restrict their backward flow relative to the substrate ( Suter et al . , 1998 ; Shimada et al . , 2008 ; Marsick et al . , 2012 ) . Since Arp2 / 3 inhibition substantially reduced barbed - end numbers and total F - actin , we investigated what effect it would have on the retro - grade flow of actin in growth cones on L1 . To this end , we made kymographs from time - lapse videos of DRG and RGC growth cones transfected with mCherry - actin and EGFP - CA , or mCherry - actin and treated with DMSO or CK666 4 h before imaging . We found that compared with controls , Arp2 / 3 inhibi - tion led to a 15 – 30 % reduction in the actin retrograde flow along veils , but no change in retrograde flow along filopodia ( Fig . 4 a – n ) . We hypothesize that the reduction in the actin retrograde flow after Arp2 / 3 inhibition is due to the reduced number of barbed ends capable of actin polymerization , which in turn generate less push against the leading edge membrane and the actin network toward the C - domain of the growth cone . We tested this idea using cytochalasin D to block monomeric actin incorporation into barbed ends and found a significant reduction in the actin retrograde flow rate , suggesting that monomeric actin incorpo - ration into barbed ends can influence the actin retrograde flow ( Fig . 4 m ) . As a further control , we measured through immuno - staining the activity of phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Ser19 ) , the active form of the regulatory subunit for myosin II and a down - stream target of ROCK , and found no difference in staining in - tensity between control and Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones ( Fig . 4 o – r ) . However , application of the ROCK inhibitor , Y27632 , did reduce staining for phospho - myosin light chain ( Fig . 4 q , r ) . This suggests that Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization at the lead - ing edge is a significant component in the driving force of the actin retrograde flow in growth cones . Arp2 / 3 role in guidance Chemoattraction depends on asymmetric leading edge protru - sion on the side of the growth cone closest to the attractant source ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ; Dent et al . , 2011 ) . In turn , leading edge protrusion depends on the fine balance between actin polymer - ization and its retrograde flow at the leading edge . Since Arp2 / 3 inhibition caused a reduction in both leading edge protrusion and the actin retrograde flow , we asked which effect Arp2 / 3 inhi - bition would have during growth cone chemoattraction . NGF ( DRG ) or Netrin ( RGC ) was applied to one side of growth cones and their turning response measured . We found that Arp2 / 3 in - hibition led to a 75 – 85 % percent reduction in growth cone turn - ing angle toward NGF or Netrin ( Fig . 5 a – f ) . Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones would generate protrusions toward the chemoat - tractant source , but often these protrusions would collapse , as occurred with the global NGF stimulation experiments ( Figs . 2 g , h , 5 d (cid:6) ) . This experiment shows that the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 is required for optimal DRG and RGC growth cone chemotaxis toward NGF and Netrin , respectively , on L1 . This finding led us to ask whether localized activation of Arp2 / 3 on its own would be sufficient to trigger growth cone turningonL1 . Duringchemotaxis , NGFandNetrinactivatemul - tiple signaling pathways that manipulate a variety of cellular pro - cesses in the growth cone ( multiple ABPs , other cytoskeletal components , vesicular trafficking , calcium signals , etc . ) , all of which contribute to an optimal turning response . However , we wanted to isolate the effect of asymmetric Arp2 / 3 activation . We performed the same guidance assay mentioned above with mod - ifications . We used the Chariot reagent to shuttle the VCA - GST peptide , which is capable of activating Arp2 / 3 ( Hu¨fner et al . , 2001 ; van der Gucht et al . , 2005 ) , into growth cones . We used this approach previously to deliver active ABPs into growth cones and study their effects during chemotaxis ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ) . We applied Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST or Chariot (cid:5) (cid:2) - galactosidase as a control , and studied growth cone responses . We found that the Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST combination was capable of steering growth cones toward its source at angles significantly larger than the Chariot (cid:5) (cid:2) - galactosidase combination ( Fig . 5 g ) . More im - portantly , turning toward the Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST source was abolished in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 , indicat - ing that Arp2 / 3 mediates the turning response elicited by Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST . Regarding the smaller turning angles triggered by Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST compared with NGF or Netrin , it is reason - able to suggest they are the result of the missing parallel signaling pathways that are normally activated by these chemoattractants , in addition toArp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization . These re - sults establish that asymmetrical activation of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex is sufficient to trigger growth cone turning on L1 . We determined that Arp2 / 3 is required to follow a soluble chemoattractant gradient on L1 . Unable to establish a soluble chemorepellent assay that would consistently repel growth cones away from the source , we opted for a membrane - bound chemorepellent assay with alternating stripes of substrate - bound L1 and L1 (cid:5) ephrin A2 . E7 temporal retina stripes were laid perpendiculartothestripesandallowedtogrowfor40h ; thefinal 24 h were under the effect of DMSO or CK666 ( Fig . 5 h ) . This approach allowed explants to initiate and grow neurites before Arp2 / 3 inhibition , thus , eliminating any possible defect that Arp2 / 3 inhibition might cause during neuritogenesis , and allow - Table1 .

Explants were fixed , and axon trajectories were revealed by immunolabeling with anti - (cid:2) 3 tubu - lin , while staining with anti - ephrin A2 assessed the integrity of the ephrin A2 lanes . We found that explants treated with DMSO had axons that consistently remained within the L1 lanes , thus avoiding the L1 (cid:5) ephrin A2 lanes ( Fig . 5 i – k ) . Interestingly , treatment with CK666 led to a range of guidance deficits that ranged from ( 1 ) growth cones ignoring ephrin A2 and crossing the boundaries , ( 2 ) continued migration over the ephrin A2 - containing lanes , and ( 3 ) axonal branching over the ephrin A2 - containing lanes ( Fig . 5 l – p ) . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization is necessary for an effective avoidanceresponsetothemembrane - boundchemorepulsivecue ephrin A2 on L1 . Laminin results Laminin as a substrate In culture , L1 promotes the formation of broad lamellar growth cones . We showed that Arp2 / 3 inhibition on this substrate causes growth cones to have deficiencies in cytoskeletal dynamics and guidance . In view of these results , we asked whether such defi - ciencies would also arise on a substrate where growth cones are more compact and filopodial , and perhaps less dependent on the branched actin network organized by Arp2 / 3 . For this reason we decided to use laminin , which is an ECM protein found in most organs and tissues and has also been shown to be an endogenous substrate for growing axons ( McLoon et al . , 1988 ) . Arp2 / 3 distribution in growth cones on laminin To assess Arp2 / 3 function in growth cones on laminin , we first asked where it was localized . Through immunostaining , we found Arp2 / 3 subunit Arp3 to be localized homogeneously across the growth cone P - domain , without any enrichment at the leading edge ( Fig . 6 a – d ) . However , Mongiu et al . ( 2007 ) reported that chick DRG growth cones do have Arp2 / 3 subunits enriched at their veils through electron microscopy . This discrepancy across labs is most likely due to the higher resolution and sensi - tivity of their screening methods . The fact that we were able to detect Arp2 / 3 subunit enrichment at the leading edge in growth cones on L1 through immunostaining might reflect a denser branched actin network on this substrate , than on laminin . Arp2 / 3 motility and axon length We showed that Arp2 / 3 was required for optimal growth cone motility on L1 . Therefore , we asked whether Arp2 / 3 was also required for motility on laminin .

As before , explants were imaged for 1 h and the velocity of individual growthconesmeasured . WefoundthatArp2 / 3inhibitiondidnot cause a significant deficit in migration velocity , compared with control growth cones ( Table 1 ) . This suggests that Arp2 / 3 is not crucial for effective growth cone motility on laminin , although it is on L1 . Even though growth cone motility on laminin over a 1 h pe - riod was not significantly affected by Arp2 / 3 inhibition , we asked whether the prolonged effect of overnight inhibition would re - duce axon elongation on laminin , as it did on L1 . For this pur - pose , we made low - density cultures of DRG neurons that were either transfected with EGFP - CA or treated with CK666 5 h after plating to inhibit Arp2 / 3 , grown overnight , fixed , and stained with anti - (cid:2) 3 tubulin . We found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition , by either of these two methods , reduced average axon length to 80 % that of controls ( Table 1 ) . This shows that prolonged inhibition of Arp2 / 3 function will reduce axon length on laminin , although not as severely as it did on L1 . Arp2 / 3 effect on actin polymerization and filopodia Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a drastic reduction in the increase of F - actin on L1 after NGF stimulation . Consequently , we asked whether Arp2 / 3 inhibition would have a similar effect on laminin , where growth cones are compact and filopodial . We pretreated DRG explants with DMSO or CK666 for 4 h , followed by global NGF stimulation , or media as a control , for 15 min . Growth cones were then fixed , stained with Alexa 488 phalloidin , and imaged . We found NGF stimulation led to a large increase in total F - actin and growth cone surface area , whereas Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones responded with only a minor increase in F - actin and area after NGF treatment ( Fig . 6 e – j ) .

Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones had fewer veils than controls , consistent with Arp2 / 3 role in nucleat - ing a branched actin network . This result shows that Arp2 / 3 me - diates actin polymerization in growth cones on laminin after NGF stimulation , as it does on L1 . Similar to other groups using non - neuronal and neuronal cells ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Svitkina et al . , 2003 ; Korobova and Svitkina , 2008 ) , we found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced the number of NGF - induced filopodia in growth cones on L1 . There - fore , we asked whether Arp2 / 3 inhibition would have any effect on the number of NGF - induced filopodia in growth cones on laminin . We found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a reduction in the number of filopodia in growth cones after NGF stimulation , like on L1 ( Fig . 6 k ) . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 is involved in the formation of filopodia on laminin and L1 . Arp2 / 3 and the retrograde flow of actin Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a reduction in the rate of the actin retro - grade flow along growth cone veils on L1 . Presumably , this de - creased rate was due to a reduced retrograde push exerted on the actin network , because of the reduced force exerted by actin po - lymerization against the leading edge membrane . Since Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced actin polymerization in growth cones on laminin , we asked which effect Arp2 / 3 inhibition would have on the actin retrograde flow on laminin . For this purpose , we did time - lapse videos of DRG neurons transfected with mCherry - actinandgrownovernight . Tooursurprise , Arp2 / 3inhibitionled to an increased actin retrograde flow rate along growth cone veils but not along filopodia on laminin , regardless of whether CK666 or EGFP - CA was used to inhibit Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 7 a – h ) . Recently , Yang et al . ( 2012 ) reported similar results in Aplysia neuronal growth cones and concluded that the actin network assembled by Arp2 / 3 restricts the myosin II - dependent contractility of the actin networkinaROCK - independentmanner ( Yangetal . , 2012 ) . When we measured phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Ser19 ) , a regulatory subunit for myosin II and downstream target of ROCK , similar to our results on L1 and Yang et al . ( 2012 ) , we found no difference in the myosin II activity after Arp2 / 3 inhibition ( Fig . 7 i – o ) . As a con - trol , the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 did reduce staining for phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Fig . 7 k , l ) . In addition , we found that the actin retrograde flow along filopodia was indistinguishable between con - trol and Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones ( Fig . 6 h ) further suggesting thattheincreasedrateintheactinretrogradeflowalongveilsisnotaresultofincreasedmyosinIIactivity .

Neurosci . , April23 , 2014 • 34 ( 17 ) : 5895 – 5908 • 5903 we examined integrin - based adhesions in growth cones on laminin , since the adhesion - based clutch is a determinant of the actin retrograde flow . Recent reports in non - neuronal cells have shown that Arp2 / 3 is recruited to nascent integrin - based adhesions and interacts with vincu - lin and FAK , as a way to couple actin polymerization to newly formed adhe - sions ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Serrels et al . , 2007 ) . We transfected DRG neurons with paxillin - GFP , a marker of integrin adhe - sions , and mCherry - CA , grew them overnight , and imaged cell - substrate in - teractions by TIRF microscopy . Consis - tent with the increased actin retrograde flow rate after Arp2 / 3 inhibition , we found that the mean area of paxillin - GFP puncta was 70 % that of controls ( Fig . 8 a – e ) . Moreover , these growth cones also had a reduced number of paxillin - GFP puncta compared with controls ( Fig . 8 f ) . It is likely that the smaller size and reduced number of adhesions are not as effective at engaging the overlying flow of actin fila - ments , and as a result the actin retrograde flow rate is faster . A recent report on fi - broblasts showed that adhesion size was not affected by Arp2 / 3 inhibition , only their orientation relative to the leading edge ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Our experiments suggest that on laminin the size and num - ber of integrin - based adhesions in growth cones is influenced by Arp2 / 3 activity . Arp2 / 3 and guidance It is thought that local stimulation of actin polymerization steers the growth cone leading edge toward attractive guidance cues ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ; Dent et al . , 2011 ) . We know that Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced the NGF - stimulated increase in F - actin content in growth cones on laminin . Arp2 / 3 inhibition also reduced actin polymerization in DRG and RGC growth cones on L1 , which was associated with a guidance deficit toward the che - moattractants NGF and Netrin , respec - tively . Therefore , we asked whether the reduction in actin polymerization on laminin after Arp2 / 3 inhibition would also affect growth cone chemoattraction toward NGF . As before , we applied NGF to one side of growth cones and measured their turning responses . Surprisingly , we found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition did not re - duce chemoattraction toward NGF , but instead we observed an increase in the turn - ing angles ( Fig . 9 a – e ) . This experiment sug - gests that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization is not required for chemoattractive turning on laminin , as opposed to on L1 . Because Arp2 / 3 inhibition did not cause deficient attractive guidancetowardNGFonlaminin , weaskedwhetheritsunilateral activation of Arp2 / 3 in a growth cone on laminin was sufficient to trigger turning . In our experiment on L1 , unilateral activation of Arp2 / 3 by the Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST complex did elicit a signifi - cantturningresponsetowardthepipetteovercontrols . Asbefore , Figure7 .

Neurosci . , April23 , 2014 • 34 ( 17 ) : 5895 – 5908 SanMiguel - RuizandLetourneau • Arp2 / 3RoleinGrowthConesIsSubstrateDependent we used a micropipette to deliver a gradient of Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST or Chariot (cid:5) B - galactosidase , as control . We found that the Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST peptide complex could not elicit growth cone turning on laminin toward the gradient source ( Fig . 9 f ) . This indicates that localized activation of Arp2 / 3 is insufficient to trigger growth cone turning on laminin , as opposed to on an L1 substrate , and suggests that other cellular processes are required to execute attractive chemotactic turning on laminin . Since Arp2 / 3 inhibition did not reduce chemoattraction to - ward NGF , we asked whether Arp2 / 3 was also dispensable for contact - mediated chemorepulsion . When we performed this ex - periment on L1 , we found that RGC axons exhibited a variety of guidance deficits . We made a boundary assay with alternating stripes of laminin or laminin (cid:5) ephrin A2 . E7 temporal retina stripes were laid perpendicular to the stripes and allowed to grow for 40 h , the final 24 h under the effect of DMSO or CK666 . Explants were fixed , and axon trajectories were revealed with anti - (cid:2) 3 tubulin , while the integrity of the ephrin A2 lanes was indicated with anti - ephrin A2 . Despite being shorter , Arp2 / 3 - inhibited axons were just as responsive to the contact - mediated chemorepulsive effects of the ephrin A2 - containing lanes as the control group ( Fig . 9 g – l ) . This result suggests that Arp2 / 3 func - tion is not required for efficient contact - mediated chemorepul - sion on laminin , as it is on L1 . Discussion Here we investigated the role of Arp2 / 3 in growth cone leading edge protrusion , actin dynamics , and guidance . Furthermore , we examined how the substrate influenced these processes . We found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced F - actin content , number of filopodia , and axon length in DRG neurons , regardless of the substrate . However , we found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition had substrate - dependent effects on actin retrograde flow and growth cone guidance . Similar to most reports on non - neuronal cells , we found Arp2 / 3 was necessary for NGF - induced growth cone leading edge protrusion on L1 ( Fig . 2 a – h ) . Interestingly , Arp2 / 3 - inhibited veils would protrude in response to NGF but then collapse ( Figs . 2 g , h , 5 d (cid:6) ) , perhaps due to the reduced branch density in the actin network at the leading edge . It is possible that the centrifugal leading edge expansion induced by actin polymerization causes an increase in centripetal membrane tension that compresses the Arp2 / 3 - inhibited actin network underneath it , leading to veil col - lapse ( Craig et al . , 2012 ) . This compressive tension can explain the actin filaments oriented parallel to the leading edge during Arp2 / 3 inhibition , as described by Strasser et al . ( 2004 ) ( Fig . 4 c ) . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 is integral for the protrusion and stability of the leading edge on L1 . Consistent with an Arp2 / 3 role in leading edge protrusion , immunostaining revealed enrichment of subunits p34 and Arp3 at the leading edge ( Fig . 1 a – g ) . Moreover , in the barbed - end assay most Rhodamine - actin incorporation occurred at the lead - ing edge , colocalized with the distal most phalloidin staining of F - actin , and was dependent on Arp2 / 3 function ( Fig . 2 j – n (cid:6) ) . Thus , Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization promotes leading edge protrusion in growth cones on L1 . Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced actin polymerization in growth cones regardless of the substrate , albeit incompletely ( Figs . 3 a – g , 6 e – i ) . This suggests either ( 1 ) incomplete inhibition of Arp2 / 3 and / or ( 2 ) there is also activation of other ABPs by NGF to pro - mote barbed - end creation and F - actin polymerization . Potential candidates are other actin nucleators like the formins , Ena / VASP proteins , and the F - actin severing protein ADF / cofilin ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ; Dent et al . , 2011 ) . Overall , this suggests that Arp2 / 3 is an important mediator of actin polymerization in growth cones on L1 and laminin . In accordance with the convergent elongation model ( Svit - kina et al . , 2003 ) , Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced the number of filop - odia in growth cones on both substrates , but only during NGF stimulation ( Figs . 3 i , 6 k ) . These results suggest that actin branches created by Arp2 / 3 after NGF stimulation mediate filopodial formation , regardless of growth cone substrate . Interestingly , inhibition of the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 led to differential changes in the rate of the actin retrograde flow . On L1 , Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduced the rate of the actin retrograde flow along veils by 15 – 30 % , which is likely due to the reduced number of barbed ends polymerizing actin at the leading edge . The idea is that the actin retrograde flow is influenced by the “pull” exerted by myosin II contractile activity along actin fila - ments , and by a “push back” from membrane tension , as polym - erizingactinfilamentsexpandtheactinnetworkandpushagainsttheleadingedge ( Henson et al . , 1999 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ; Craig et al . , 2012 ) . This model is supported by our experiments with cytochalasin D ( Fig . 4 a – m ) , whereby inhibition of actin polym - erization significantly reduced its retrograde flow . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization at the lead - ing edge influences the rate of the actin retrograde flow . Figure8 .

Neurosci . , April23 , 2014 • 34 ( 17 ) : 5895 – 5908 • 5905 In contrast to results on L1 , Arp2 / 3 inhibition on laminin increased the actin retrograde flow along veils . Recently , Yang et al . ( 2012 ) reported similar findings and concluded that the branched actin network assembled by Arp2 / 3 can restrict the myosin II - dependent component of the actin retrograde flow . This suggests that during myosin II contractility a higher branch density in the actin network can slow its retrograde flow , presum - ably due to increased interactions with other cytoskeletal compo - nents like microtubules , other actin structures , or adhesions . As an alternative and complementary explanation for the increased actin retrograde flow , we found that Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a reduction in the area and number of paxillin - GFP puncta per growth cone of 40 and 20 % , respectively ( Fig . 8 a – f ) . Therefore , Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones on laminin were less effective in engaging the “clutch” to slow the flow of actin filaments , leading to an increased retrograde flow rate . Notably , Arp2 / 3 inhibition in fibroblasts did not change adhesion size , only their organiza - tion relative to the leading edge ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . This discrep - ancy can be explained by the difference in cell type , substrate , and adhesions studied , since growth cone adhesions are round and small , versusthelonglinearfocaladhesionsseeninnon - neuronal cells . Why are adhesions smaller after Arp2 / 3 inhibition ? It is known that Arp2 / 3 is recruited to nascent integrin adhesions ( DeMali et al . , 2002 ; Serrels et al . , 2007 ) and that the actin retro - grade flow can transfer myosin II - generated tension to promote adhesion growth and maturation ( Galbraith et al . , 2002 ; Choi et al . , 2008 ; Wolfenson et al . , 2011 ) . Consequently , we propose that Arp2 / 3 inhibition reduces the chance for adhesions to interact with the overhead actin network because of its reduced branch density , in turn , leading to reduced tension on adhesions by the retrograde flow , which could reduce their maturation and / or sta - bility . In agreement , Woo and Gomez ( 2006 ) showed that ROCK inhibition , a direct regulator of myosin II activity and actin ret - rograde flow , led to smaller and less stable growth cone adhesions on laminin . Consistent with reports that actin polymerization is critical for guidance ( Lanier et al . , 1999 ; Marsick et al . , 2010 ) , growth cones exhibited reduced turning responses to chemoattractants ( NGF or Netrin ) and defective chemorepulsive responses ( substrate - bound ephrin A2 ) on L1 during Arp2 / 3 inhibition . The reduced leading edge protrusion and the veil collapse during Arp2 / 3 inhibition would hamper growth cone turning toward an attractant .

Additionally , we also showed that unilateral Arp2 / 3 activa - tion with Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST was sufficient to trigger growth cone turning on L1 . These results serve to highlight the central role the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 plays during growth cone guid - ance on L1 . Nevertheless , performing the same attractive guidance assay on laminin during Arp2 / 3 inhibition caused no deficits . On the contrary , Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to increased turning responses during chemoattraction toward NGF . We can speculate on why these growth cones had a larger turning response . We know Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones on laminin have less and smaller adhesions , which would allow for faster dismantling and , hence , substrate detachment on the side opposite to the chemoattrac - tant . This would allow growth cones to steer and follow the che - moattractant gradient more readily than control growth cones . Alternatively , larger turning responses of Arp2 / 3 - inhibited growth cones could result from faster retrograde flow of actin . Neurotrophins increase the number of integrin adhesions of growth cones ( Carlstrom et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , NGF stimula - tion during turning could trigger the strengthening or formation of new adhesions closer to its source . In turn , these adhesions could harness the faster actin retrograde flow and convert it into a greater turning response . Even though Arp2 / 3 was inhibited , other actin nucleators like the formins and generation of barbed ends by ADF / cofilin severing activity could coordinate actin po - lymerization to steer growth cones toward the NGF source . Similarly , Arp2 / 3 inhibition caused no defect on RGC growth cone response to avoid the ephrin A2 (cid:5) laminin lanes on the boundary assay . Once again , other actin nucleators may be or - chestrating actin filament polymerization to steer growth cones away from the ephrin A2 (cid:5) laminin lanes . Alternatively , growth cones could steer away from the ephrin A2 (cid:5) laminin lanes be - cause of the reduced adhesivity they offer . It was shown that chemorepellent cues can dismantle integrin adhesions ( Hines et al . , 2010 ) ; therefore , in the boundary assay growth cones could remain on the laminin lanes because of their increased adhesivity , compared with the ephrin A2 (cid:5) laminin ones . Also , supplemen - tal to these results , we showed that delivery of the Chariot (cid:5) VCA - GST complex , to unilaterally activate Arp2 / 3 on one side of the growth cone , failed to trigger turning on laminin . Therefore , we conclude that Arp2 / 3 is dispensable for an attractive guidance response to a soluble chemoattractant and for a repulsive guid - ance response to a membrane - bound chemorepellent , when growth cones migrate on laminin . In conclusion , during development growth cones migrate in association with diverse substrates and respond to different guid - ance cues . In doing so , diverse signaling pathways are activated to regulatedifferentABPstoorganizeactinstructuresandmodulatetheirdynamicstoensurethatgrowthconesreachtheirtargets . We probed the role of the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 during growth cone motility and found it crucial for guidance on L1 , but not on laminin . Previous studies have also shown the diversity of actin regulatory mechanisms in neuronal motility on different sub - strates . For example , Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin structures were necessary for exocytosis and neuritogenesis on laminin , but not on PDL ( poly - d - lysine ) , where exocytosis and neuritogenesis re - lied on Ena / VASP - dependent actin structures ( Gupton and Gertler , 2010 ) . In addition , ENA / VASP - null neurons cannot form neurites on PDL , but on laminin neurite formation by ENA / VASP - null neurons is normal ( Dent et al . , 2007 ) .
