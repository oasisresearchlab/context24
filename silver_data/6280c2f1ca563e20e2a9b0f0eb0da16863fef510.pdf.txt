Posted on 19 February 2013 2 1 Summary 2 3 During Drosophila embryogenesis the first epithelium with defined cortical compartments is 4 established during cellularization . Actin polymerization is required for the separation of lateral 5 and basal domains as well as suppression of tubular extensions in the basal domain . The actin 6 nucleator mediating this function is unknown . We found that the formin diaphanous ( dia ) is 7 required for establishing and maintaining distinct lateral and basal domains during cellularization . 8 In dia mutant embryos lateral marker proteins , such as Discs - large ( Dlg ) and Armadillo / beta - 9 Catenin ( Arm ) spread into the basal compartment . Furthermore , high - resolution and live - imaging 10 analysis of dia mutant embryos revealed an increased number of membrane extensions and 11 endocytic activity at the basal domain , indicating a suppressing function of dia on membrane 12 invaginations . Dia function may be based on an antagonistic interaction with the F - BAR protein 13 Cip4 / Toca - 1 , a known activator of the WASP / WAVE - Arp2 / 3 pathway . Dia and Cip4 physically 14 and functionally interact and overexpression of Cip4 phenocopies dia loss - of - function . In vitro , 15 Cip4 inhibits mainly actin nucleation by Dia . Thus , our data support a model in which linear actin 16 filaments induced by Dia stabilize cortical compartmentalization by antagonizing WASP / WAVE - 17 Arp2 / 3 induced membrane turnover . 18 19 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 3 Introduction 1 2 In early Drosophila embryogenesis the first polarized cells are formed during cellularization 3 immediately following the last nuclear division , when the plasma membrane invaginates between 4 adjacent nuclei and generates a network of furrows with furrow canals ( FC ) at its leading edge . 5 During invagination the membrane polarizes forming distinct basal and lateral domains ( Lecuit 6 and Wieschaus , 2000 ) . The basal domain comprises the FC . The FC membrane is highly dynamic 7 in the initial phase of cellularization forming micrometer long tubules extending from the basal 8 domain into the cytoplasm ( Sokac and Wieschaus , 2008a ) . After about 5 - 10 min the tubular 9 extensions disappear indicating a stabilization of the FC membrane . Concomitantly with 10 polarization and membrane stabilization , F - actin accumulates at the FC . Drug treatment showed 11 that F - actin is required to maintain membrane polarization and stabilization ( Sokac and 12 Wieschaus , 2008a , b ) . However , the actin nucleator responsible for these functions has not been 13 identified yet . 14 15 The formin Dia represents a likely candidate . Formins control membrane associated F - actin and 16 membrane dependent processes and structures such as contractile ring in cytokinesis , endosomal 17 dynamics , phagocytosis as well as protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia ( Chesarone et 18 al . , 2010 ) . In Drosophila embryos , Dia functionally associates with the cytokinetic furrow 19 ( Castrillon and Wasserman , 1994 ) , with mitotic pseudocleavage furrow in syncytial embryos and 20 the furrow canal during cellularization ( Afshar et al , 2000 ; Barmchi et al . , 2005 ; Großhans et al , 21 2005 ) , cell contacts during cell intercalation ( Levayer et al . , 2011 ) , with adherens junctions in the 22 epidermis ( Homem and Peifer , 2008 ) and controls apical secretion ( Massarwa et al . , 2009 ) . The 23 activity of Dia is controlled by Rho1 ( also called RhoA ) that releases an autoinhibitory 24 intramolecular interaction ( Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Großhans et al . , 2005 ) . In addition to 25 RhoGTPases , as yet unidentified membrane associated factors are most likely involved in 26 regulation of Dia ( Faix and Grosse , 2006 , Chesarone et al . , 2010 ; Seth et al . , 2006 ) . 27 28 A molecular link between the membrane and actin dynamics is provided by proteins of the F - 29 BAR family , such as Cip4 / Toca - 1 ( Heath and Insall , 2008 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Aspenstöm , 30 2010 ; Fricke et al . , 2010 ) . Cip4 / Toca - 1 binds to membranes with high curvature and recruits 31 activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex such as SCAR / WAVE and WASP with its C - terminal SH3 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 4 domain to promote local accumulation of branched actin filaments ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . Arp2 / 3 1 induced branched actin filaments play important functions in membrane dependent processes 2 including membrane protrusions , vesicle rocketing and movement , cell junctions and endocytosis 3 ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 , Suetsugu and Gautreau , 2012 ) . Although members of the F - BAR 4 family can clearly affect actin regulators and the structure of phospholipid membranes in various 5 experimental situations , their physiological function is less obvious possibly due to genetic 6 redundancy ( Fricke et al . , 2010 ; Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ) . 7 8 In this study , we identify Dia as an actin nucleator responsible for F - actin formation in 9 compartmentalization and membrane stabilization during cellularization . Furthermore , we reveal 10 and characterize a direct and antagonistic interaction of Dia with the F - BAR protein Cip4 . 11 12 Results 13 14 Lateral marker proteins are not excluded from the furrow canal in dia mutants 15 16 During the initial phase of cellularization , the basal and lateral cortical domains of the plasma 17 membrane are established and maintained ( Lecuit and Wieschaus 2000 ) . The basal domain 18 comprises the FC , the lateral domain and the furrow ( Figure 1A ) . Some markers , such as Discs - 19 large ( Dlg ) , Armadillo ( Arm , Drosophila homologue of beta - catenin ) , Patj and Slam are 20 exclusively found in either the lateral or basal domain , whereas others such as RhoGEF2 , Dia or 21 F - actin are strongly enriched in the basal domain ( Figures 1A - C , Großhans et al . , 2005 ) . To test 22 whether Dia is involved in establishing or maintaining the cortical compartments , we stained 23 embryos from dia germline clones ( in the following called dia embryos ) for lateral and basal 24 markers . In contrast to wild type embryos , the lateral marker Dlg spread into the basal domain 25 where it overlapped with Patj ( Figures 1D , F ) . The overlap with FC markers was detected 26 throughout cellularization , including mid and late stages , when the FC has passed through the 27 nuclear layer . Similar to Dlg , the junctional marker Arm stained the FC as shown by the overlap 28 with Slam ( Figures 1E , G ) . To assess the specificity of the phenotype we analyzed embryos 29 mutant for Abl , encoding the non - receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson that regulates F - actin 30 organization in the early embryo ( Grevengoed et al . , 2003 ) . With respect to Dlg and Slam 31 distribution we found no differences between Abl mutant and wild type embryos ( Figure 1H ) , 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 5 showing that Dia controls specific aspects of F - actin formation at the FC . In contrast to Dlg and 1 Arm , Slam and Patj remained restricted to the basal domain in wild type and dia embryos , 2 suggesting that Dia is not essential for defining or maintaining the identity of the basal domain . 3 In summary , our data show that Dia is required for exclusion of lateral markers from the furrow 4 canal and thus for separating lateral and basal cortical domains . 5 6 Persistent tubular membrane invaginations in dia mutants 7 8 During cellularization the invaginating plasma membrane is initially highly dynamic but 9 stabilizes after about 5 - 10 minutes ( Figure 2A ) . The dynamic membrane is characterized by long 10 tubular extensions that are labelled by the N - BAR protein Amphiphysin ( Amph , Zelhof et al . , 11 2001 ; Sokac and Wieschaus , 2008a ) . The tubular extensions are only transiently visible . When 12 the furrow forms and F - actin accumulates at the FC after about 5 to 15 minutes in interphase 14 , 13 the tubular extensions disappear ( Sokac and Wieschaus , 2008a ) . F - actin is required for this 14 stabilization of the membrane , since treatment of embryos with Cytochalasin leads to persisting 15 long tubular extensions ( Sokac and Wieschaus , 2008a ) . To test a function of Dia in the 16 stabilization of the FC , we characterized Amph staining in dia embryos by conventional and high 17 resolution STED microscopy ( Figures 2B , C ) . In contrast to conventional confocal microscopy 18 showing uniform staining , a dotted distribution of Amph along the tubular extensions was 19 detected by high resolution STED microscopy . We did not observe an obvious difference of the 20 dotted pattern and tubular length in wild type and dia embryos . Analyzing the tubular extensions 21 in relation to progression of cellularization , we found that Dia is required for suppression of the 22 tubular extensions after the furrow has formed . In mid and late stage cellularization when almost 23 no Amph marked membrane tubules were observed in wild type embryos , one third of the FC 24 were still associated with long Amph tubules in dia embryos ( Figure 2D ) . These data show that 25 Dia is required for suppression of tubular membrane extensions at the basal compartment . 26 27 To analyze the dynamics of the tubular extensions , we explored embryos expressing the FC - 28 specific marker GFP - slam ( Wenzl et al . , 2010 ) . Time - lapse recordings of embryos expressing 29 GFP - slam showed dynamic tubular extensions with a life time in the range of minutes ( Figure 30 2E , supplemental material . Movies M1 , M2 ) . In wild type embryos , these tubular extensions were 31 observed only during the first 5 to 10 minutes of cellularization . In contrast , dynamic extensions 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 6 of the FC frequently formed even at later stages of cellularization in dia embryos . Beside this 1 specific marker of the FC , we observed the uptake of fluorescently labelled wheat germ 2 agglutinin , injected into extracellular perivitteline space . Incorporation of labelled WGA was not 3 restricted to the FC , occurring all along the furrow . Comparing the time course of the number of 4 fluoresent punctae in wild type and dia embryos , we found no obvious difference , suggesting that 5 dia has no crucial function in general endocytosis ( Supplemental material Figure S1 , Movie M3 , 6 M4 ) . Taken together these experiments demonstrate that Dia suppresses tubular extensions and 7 thus controls the stabilization of the FC membrane during cellularization . 8 9 The F - BAR protein Cip4 directly binds Dia and antagonizes Dia function during 10 cellularization 11 12 How might Dia be controlled to stabilize FC membranes ? F - BAR proteins are involved in 13 coupling actin dynamics with the membrane ( Heath and Insall , 2008 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; 14 Aspenstöm , 2010 ; Fricke et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , members of the Cip4 subfamily of F - BAR 15 proteins in mammals such as Cip4 and FBP17 have been originally identified as Formin - binding 16 proteins ( Chan et al . , 1996 ; Aspenström et al . , 2006 ) . We have recently found that Cip4 , the only 17 member of the Cip4 subfamily in Drosophila , integrates membrane and actin dynamics through 18 WASP and SCAR / WAVE proteins ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . This prompted us to test whether Dia 19 and Cip4 physically interact in Drosophila . We first performed a pulldown assay with total 20 lysates from cultured Drosophila Schneider ( S2R + ) cells . Dia as well as WAVE / SCAR were 21 specifically pulled down with GST - Cip4 bound to beads ( Figure 3A , Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . 22 Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed a specific interaction of Dia and GFP - Cip4 . 23 Following expression of GFP - Cip4 in Drosophila S2 cells and immunoprecipitation with GFP 24 antibodies , endogenous Dia was specifically detected in the bound fraction ( Figure 3B ) . Finally , 25 we reconstituted a direct interaction of Dia and Cip4 with purified proteins . Applying increasing 26 amounts of ZZ - DiaC , a fusion protein of the ZZ ( proteinA ) tag and the C - terminal half of Dia 27 including the FH1 and FH2 domains ( Supplemental material . Figure S3 , S4 ) , we found specific 28 binding to GST - Cip4 but not to GST alone ( Figure 3C ) . 29 30 We next investigated the functional relationship of the Cip4 - Dia interaction during 31 cellularization . Cip4 colocalizes with Dia at the plasma membrane including the FC where Dia is 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 7 present ( Figure 4A , Großhans et al . , 2005 ) . Both proteins localize independently of each other , 1 since Dia and Cip4 staining patterns are no obviously altered in the respective mutant embryos 2 ( Figures 4B , C ) . Cip4 deficient embryos do not show defects in cellularization ( data not shown ) 3 and develop normally , what may be due to redundant functions with other F - BAR family 4 members ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ; Giuliani et al . , 2009 ; Kovacevic et al . , 2012 ) . To assess a potential 5 function of Cip4 , we first generated dia Δ Cip4 double mutant embryos and analyzed the domain 6 separation and the presence of tubular extensions stained by Amph ( Figure 4D ) . In these embryos 7 tubular membrane extensions at the furrow canal were detected even in later stages . Similar to 8 dia embryos , Dlg spread into the basal domain . We did not observe an obvious suppression or 9 enhancement of the dia phenotype . Secondly Cip4 was overexpressed . We found that Cip4 10 induced cellularization defects similar to those seen in dia mutants . In such embryos , the lateral 11 protein Dlg was not excluded from the basal domain , as indicated by the overlap with Patj , and 12 multinuclear cells formed ( Figure 4E ) . This activity depends on the SH3 domain of Cip4 , since 13 expression of Cip4 Δ SH3 - GFP did not impair lateral and basal domain separation in the furrow 14 and did not interfere with cellularization ( Supplemental material Figure S2 ) . 15 16 The antagonizing functions of Cip4 and Dia were not restricted to the early embryo . Both 17 overexpression of Cip4 and depletion of dia by RNAi in wing epithelia strongly induced 18 cytokinesis defects ( Figure 4F ) . Differentiated wings displayed a multiple wing hair phenotype 19 that is based on multiple trichomes per cell and is characteristic for polyploid or polynucleoid 20 cells . Live imaging of larval imaginal discs directly showed the impaired cytokinesis ( Figure 4F , 21 Supplemental material . Movies M5 - M7 ) . Thus , these data show that Cip4 antagonizes dia in 22 vivo . 23 24 Cip4 is known to promote Arp2 / 3 dependent actin polymerization ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . To test 25 whether the antagonism of Cip4 and Dia involves Arp2 / 3 induced F - actin , we reduced Arp2 / 3 26 activity by injection of the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 ( Nollen et al . , 2009 ) in wild type and dia 27 embryos and by reduction of Arp3 gene dose ( Figure 5 ) . Injection of the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 28 led to a reduced number of Amph stained tubules in wild type at the onset of cellularization . In 29 contrast , injection of CK666 into dia embryos did not reduce the number of tubular extensions . 30 Furthermore reduction of the Arp3 gene dose in Arp3 heterozygous embryos led to a significant 31 reduction in the number of tubular extensions as compared to wild type embryos . Both 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 8 experiments indicate that the formation or stability of tubular extensions involves Arp2 / 3 and that 1 dia counteracts this activity . 2 3 Cip4 recruits Dia to membrane tubules 4 5 We next analyzed the functional interaction between Cip4 and Dia at the cellular and molecular 6 level in more detail . As recently shown , Cip4 tubulates membranes and localizes at highly 7 dynamic vesicles in cultured Drosophila S2R + cells ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . To explore the 8 localization and the dynamics of Cip4 and Dia we co - expressed a series of mCherry tagged Cip4 9 and EGFP tagged Dia proteins ( Figures 6A - H , Supplemental material . Movies M8 - M14 ) . Full - 10 length Dia - GFP was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of S2R + cells ( Fig . 6B , supplemental 11 data M8 ) . However , Cip4 co - expression caused Dia to relocalize to the Cip4 - mCherry labelled 12 membrane tubules and vesicles ( Figure 6C ) . Using a series of truncations we mapped the 13 domains mediating the membrane recruitment of Dia , revealing that the SH3 domain of Cip4 and 14 the FH1 domain of Dia are required and the proline rich FH1 domain , sufficient for mutual 15 binding ( Figures 6D - F ) . In the cases of GFP - Dia Δ FH1 and Cip4 Δ SH3 - mCherry , that lost the co - 16 localization , we observed a weak colocalization signal , which may be due to multimerization 17 with endogenous proteins or additional weak interaction domains . We also tested whether the 18 Cip4 labelled tubules were affected by activation or depletion of Dia . Expression of a 19 constitutively activated form of Dia ( GFP - Dia Δ DAD ) stabilized the Cip4 - induced tubules and 20 reduced budding ( Figure 6G , Supplemental material . Movie M13 ) indicating that Dia counteracts 21 Cip4 - induced membrane dynamics . In contrast depletion of dia by RNAi did not significantly 22 change the dynamics of Cip4 induced vesicles and tubules ( Figure 6H , Supplemental material . 23 Movie M14 ) , suggesting that dia has no essential function in Cip4 induced membrane dynamics . 24 25 CIP4 inhibits Dia - dependent actin nucleation and elongation 26 27 Finally , we tested whether Cip4 binding affects the actin polymerization activity of the C - 28 terminal half of Dia ( DiaC ) that is sufficient for actin nucleation in vitro ( Großhans et al . , 2005 ) . 29 Consistent with our previous finding ( Großhans et al . , 2005 ) , autoinhibition was reconstituted in 30 pyrene assays by addition of ZZ tagged DiaN , a truncated Dia comprising the N - terminal half 31 ( Figure 7A , Supplemental material . Figure S3 , S4 ) . To test whether Cip4 was able to effect actin 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 9 assembly , we added increasing amounts of purified Cip4 protein to 10 nM ZZ - DiaC . This led to 1 an inhibition of actin polymerization in a concentration dependent manner almost comparable to 2 autoinhibition . Notably , a Cip4 mutant protein lacking the C - terminal SH3 domain ( Cip4 Δ SH3 ) 3 showed only weak inhibition , indicating that the inhibition of actin polymerization by DiaC is 4 largely mediated by the interaction between the CIP4 - SH3 domain and the FH1 domain of Dia . 5 Consistently , GST - SH3 also inhibited actin polymerization , however only at higher 6 concentrations ( Figure 7B ) . To elucidate whether the inhibition is due to a reduced nucleation 7 activity , filament nucleation was analyzed by in vitro TIRF microscopy ( Figure 7C - D , 8 Supplemental material . Movie M15 ) . 10 nM ZZ - DiaC nucleated approximately three times more 9 filaments when compared to the actin control . Consistent with the pyrene assay , the nucleation 10 activity of DiaC was strongly inhibited by Cip4 . Addition of a 10 - fold molar excess of Cip4 led 11 to the formation of a reduced number of filaments comparable to the actin control . Notably , 12 Cip4 Δ SH3 showed a weaker inhibitory effect than full length Cip4 , once more demonstrating the 13 importance of the SH3 domain for the Cip4 - Dia interaction . We therefore reasoned that Cip4 - 14 SH3 might compete with profilin - actin for binding to the Dia - FH1 . In order to allow usage of 15 relatively high concentrations of Cip4 , the BAR domain was deleted , since full length Cip4 16 formed aggregates above 500 nM at the conditions of the actin polymerization assays . In pyrene 17 assays with DiaC and profilin , Cip4 Δ BAR as well as GST - SH3 inhibited actin polymerization 18 ( Fig . 8A ) . Interestingly , the inhibitory effect by the GST - SH3 domain was stronger in the 19 presence of profilin ( compare Figs . 7B and 8B ) , in fact supporting a competition between 20 profilin - actin and Cip4 - SH3 for interaction with Dia - FH1 . Like in the absence of profilin ( Figure 21 7 ) the nucleation activity of DiaC was inhibited by Cip4 Δ BAR and also by Cip4 Δ BAR Δ SH3 , 22 albeit to a weaker extend as revealed by the TIRF assay ( Figure 8C ) . 23 24 Formins typically promote actin polymerization not only by their nucleation activities , but also 25 by catalyzing the elongation of existing filament - barbed ends in the presence of profilin . Thus , 26 we next analyzed the elongation properties of DiaC in the absence or presence of regulatory 27 proteins in the TIRF assay . Notably , even in the absence of profilin , DiaC slightly increased the 28 filament elongation rate by about 2 subunits / second to ~ 16 subunits / sec when compared with the 29 actin control elongating with ~ 14 subunits / sec ( Supplemental material Table S1 ) . This was not 30 expected , since all as yet characterized formins inhibit filament elongation under these 31 conditions , albeit the inhibition of fast formins such as mDia1 is negligible ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 10 Dia certainly belongs to the latter category , as in the presence of profilin , DiaC promoted barbed - 1 end elongation with a speed of ~ 140 subunits / sec ( Figure 8D , Supplemental material Table S1 ) . 2 Concerning DiaC - mediated elongation in the presence of profilin and Cip4 , two populations of 3 filaments could be identified : fast - growing filaments elongating with about 100 subunits per 4 second and slow - growing filaments that grew like the control filaments with about 11 subunits 5 per second ( Figure 8D - F ) . The number of fast - growing filaments was strongly reduced in the 6 presence of Cip4 Δ BAR and also by Cip4 Δ BAR Δ SH3 , however , only Cip4 Δ BAR weakly reduced 7 the elongation rate of the fast - growing filaments . These observations indicate that Cip4 interferes 8 with both Dia activities , though inhibition of nucleation seems to be the main cause . 9 10 Discussion 11 12 A link of F - actin with membrane remodeling and endocytosis is well established ( Suetsugu and 13 Gautreau , 2012 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Itoh et al . , 2006 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . F - BAR proteins 14 recruit activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex such as WAVE and WASP to endocytic sites ( Ho et al . , 15 2004 ; Takano et al . , 2008 ) . Cip4 is one member of the F - BAR protein family ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ; 16 Fricke et al . , 2010 ; Nahm et al . , 2010 ) and involved in the control of Arp2 / 3 dependent actin 17 polymerization and Dynamin recruitment ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . During endocytosis actin 18 filaments stabilize the neck of the endocytic bud , promote efficient budding by Dynamin and 19 displace the budded vesicles away from the membrane ( Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Ferguson et al . , 20 2009 ) . In addition to the defined role of F - BAR proteins in linking branched F - actin and 21 endocytosis , F - BAR domain proteins have been found to interact with formins as well , although 22 the relevance of these interactions has remained elusive ( Aspenstrom et al . , 2006 ; Chan et al . , 23 1996 ) . Here , we uncovered a novel interaction of Cip4 with Dia . The function of linear F - actin 24 nucleated by Dia appears to be different than Arp2 / 3 induced branched F - actin that promotes 25 endocytosis . Dia counteracts membrane remodeling , since dia mutants lack the stabilization of 26 the membrane in the basal domain during cellularization as observed by two indicators of 27 membrane stability , tubular extensions labelled by Amph and GFPslam dynamics . The 28 suppression of tubular extensions after about 5 to 10 minutes during wild type cellularization 29 correlates with the increased stability of the basal domain as measured by membrane labeling 30 ( Lecuit and Wieschaus , 2000 ) and the accumulation of F - actin at the furrow canal . The Cip4 31 induced tubules in cultured S2R + cells are , however , unrelated to the Amph labelled tubular 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 11 extensions at the furrow canal , since they are budding and not labelled by Amph ( data not 1 shown ) . Thus , Cip4 antagonistically controls two different pools of actin filaments , induction of 2 branched filaments through its WASP / WAVE interaction and suppression of linear filaments 3 formed by Dia . Such a dual activity may promote efficient membrane remodeling by positively 4 acting on branched F - actin filaments while concomitantly suppressing inhibitory linear actin 5 filaments . 6 7 How could Dia suppress tubular membrane extensions ? We favor a model in which linear actin 8 filaments form a dense cortical layer that affects the mechanical properties of the membrane such 9 as tension and rigidity . The increased rigidity would make invaginations and bending that can 10 lead to endocytic buds or long membrane extensions less favorable . Such a function would be in 11 contrast to the function of Arp2 / 3 nucleated branched F - actin network , which has a direct and 12 promoting role in the endocytic reaction cycle . The model is consistent with our previous 13 observation of extracellular blebs within the FC in dia mutants ( Großhans et al . , 2005 ) , and the 14 data shown here regarding tubular membrane extensions . 15 16 Our biochemical analyses revealed unique properties of Dia . As opposed to other formins ( Kovar et 17 al . , 2006 ) , in the absence of profilin , DiaC even slightly promotes filament elongation . Moreover , by 18 elongating filament barbed ends with ~ 140 subunits / second in the presence of profilin , Dia is to our 19 knowledge the fastest as yet characterized formin in vitro . We further show Dia to interact with Cip4 20 leading to inhibition of Dia - mediated actin polymerization . This interaction is primarily based on the 21 Dia - FH1 and Cip4 - SH3 domains . In addition to these interacting modules there is also a contribution 22 by other regions outside the SH3 domain , as evidenced by the weak but clear inhibitory effect of 23 Cip4 constructs lacking this region . In bulk actin polymerization assays and by single filament TIRF 24 microscopy we could dissect how Cip4 interferes with Dia function . Cip4 clearly inhibits the 25 nucleation activity , since fewer filaments were formed in the absence or presence of profilin . Cip4 26 also appears to impair Dia - mediated elongation . Interestingly , however , in the presence of profilin 27 and Cip4 Δ BAR , we observed two different populations of filaments . One group comprising the large 28 majority of the filaments ( > 90 % ) elongated with the speed of actin control filaments with about 11 29 subunits per second . The remaining filaments grew with about 66 % of the speed of the fast growing 30 filaments in the presence of DiaC and profilin . How can these findings be explained ? Cip4 binding to 31 Dia may prevent association of the formin with the barbed end . In this case the filaments would grow 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 12 as if Dia were not present . The fast growing filaments on the other hand are expected to carry Dia at 1 their barbed ends . However , since these filaments grow slower than the fast Dia control filaments , 2 Cip4 must interfere with their elongation . Cip4 - SH3 binding to Dia may therefore , for instance by 3 steric hindrance , either prevent efficient recruitment of actin monomers to the Dia - FH1 region or 4 their subsequent delivery to the catalytic FH2 domain . Alternatively , Cip4 binding may induce 5 structural changes in the FH2 domain . Thus , single molecule imaging combined with multi - color 6 labeling and structural analysis of the Cip4 - Dia complex will be necessary to clearly distinguish these 7 possibilities . In vivo , the association of the F - BAR domain with the membrane may also expected to 8 modulate the interaction . Future biochemical studies , including lipid surfaces binding to the F - BAR 9 domain and single molecule experiments with differentially labeled components , will be required to 10 resolve the underlying molecular mechanism at high resolution . 11 12 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 13 Materials and Methods 1 2 Genetics 3 dia [ SY5 ] was isolated in a screen for novel dia alleles ( Supplemental material Figure S5 ) . Briefly 4 six alleles ( dia [ SY1 ] to dia [ SY6 ] ) were isolated in a F2 screen for lethals over the deficiency 5 Df ( 2L ) DS9 and non - complementation with dia [ 1 ] out of about 5000 EMS mutagenized al dp b 6 pr Frt2L [ 40A ] chromosomes . Transgenes of UASp - GFPslam was generated by P element 7 mediated insertion into the genome by standard techniques . UASp - GFPCip4 and UASp - 8 GFPCip4 Δ SH3 transgenes were targeted to the 86Fb ( nt 7634081 ) landing site by PhiC31 9 ( Bischof et al . , 2007 ) . Maternal expression of UASp transgenes was driven with a tubulinVP16 - 10 GAL4 line ( Wenzl et al . , 2010 ) . Maternal expression of GFPslam rescues the slam cellularization 11 phenotype of Df ( 2L ) BSC5 ( data not shown ) . Following mutations and transgenes were used : 12 dia [ 5 ] ( Afshar et al 2000 ) , cip4 ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) , Abl [ 4 ] ( Grevengoed et al . , 2003 ) , Arp3 13 ( Berger et al . , 2008 ) , UASt - diaRNAi ( Vienna stock center . Vdrc stock # 20518 on III . 14 chromosome ) , UASt - tubulinGFP , Histon2Av - RFP , UASt - Cip4 [ Myr ] . The myristylation signal 15 was derived from the N - terminal 88 amino acids of the Drosophila src1 gene and fused in frame 16 with the Cip4 coding sequence . If not otherwise noted , genetic elements and materials are 17 described in FLYBASE and stocks were obtained from the Bloomington stock centre . 18 19 Molecular genetics 20 UASp - GFPslam : The coding sequence of a GFPslam fusion and the 3 ' UTR of slam were excised 21 as an XbaI fragment from pMT - GFPslam ( Wenzl et al . , 2010 ) and ligated into the XbaI site of 22 pUASp . pETchick was generated by inserting the complete and unchanged coding sequence of 23 chickadee ( Drosophila profilin , EST clone LD15851 ) into the NcoI site of pET15b with InFusion 24 technology ( Clontech ) . Cloning primers were AAGAA GGAGA TATAC CATGA GCTGG 25 CAAand GATTA CTTGC GGGTA CTAGC ATGGG CAGCA GCCAT . pGST - Amph ( 1 - 357 ) 26 and pUASt - GFPDia Δ DAD plasmids were obtained from Dr O ' Kane ( Razzaq et al . , 2001 ) and Dr 27 Schejter , respectively . Cip4 and dia cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into Gateway 28 Entry Vectors ( pENTR D - TOPO , Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 29 ( Escherichia coli Expression System with Gateway Technology , Invitrogen ) . QuickChange XL 30 Site - Directed Mutagenesis ( Stratagene , Agilent Technologies ) kit was used to generate distinct 31 deletions . Primer details are available upon request . The inserts were sequenced and cloned into 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 14 corresponding destination vectors ( Drosophila Genomics Resource Center ) by LR in vitro 1 recombination , containing UASt / p promoters and C - terminal eGFP and Cherry tags . dsRNA was 2 synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase with PCR amplified DNA ( Wenzl 3 2010 ) . Following primers were used to generate a dia specific template : TAATA CGACT 4 CACTA TAGGG TCGTT CTGCAT TGTCT ATGAG C and TAATA CGACT CACTA 5 TAGGG ATCTT CTTCT CGTAC TCCTC CG . 6 7 An overview of Dia and Cip4 constructs is summarized in the supplemental data ( Supplemental 8 material . Figure S3 ) 9 10 Histology 11 Embryos were fixed either in 4 % formaldehyde / PBS or heat treatment and methanol as 12 previously described ( Wenzl et al . , 2010 ) . The following antibodies were used : rabbit - anti - Dia 13 ( 1 : 1000 , Großhans et al . , 2005 ) , rabbit - anti - Slam ( 1 : 2000 , Wenzl et al . , 2010 ) , mouse - anti - Dlg 14 ( 1 : 100 , Hybridoma Center ) , mouse - anti - Arm ( 1 : 200 , Hybridoma Center ) , rabbit - anti - Patj 15 ( 1 : 1000 , Richard et al . , 2006 ) , rabbit - anti - Cip4 ( 1 : 500 , preadsorbed at Cip4 deficiency embryos , 16 Fricke et al . , 2009 ) , guinea pig - and rat - anti - Amph ( 1 : 1000 ) . Secondary antibodies were labelled 17 with Alexa dyes ( 4 µg / ml , Invitrogen ) or Atto dyes ( 1 : 100 , for STED ) . F - actin was stained by 18 Alexa - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) and DNA was stained using DAPI ( 0 . 2 µg / ml ) . The Amph 19 antibodies were raised against GST - Amph ( aa1 - 357 ) . GST - Amph protein was expressed in E . 20 coli and purified by chromatography with GSH - Sepharose ( GE health care ) beads . 21 22 Microinjection of embryos 23 Microinjection was performed as previously described ( Großhans et al . , 1994 ) . Alexa - labelled 24 wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the perivitelline space of embryos in nuclear cycle 13 . 25 Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 ( Nollen et al . , 2009 , in DMSO , Calbiochem ) into the posterior half of 26 embryos . Fixation was about 15 min after injection . The estimated injection volume is assumed 27 to be in the range of 1 % of the total embryo volume . 28 29 Imaging of embryos 30 Preparation and handling of embryos for life imaging was as previously described ( Kanesaki et 31 al . , 2011 ) . Time - lapse movies were recorded with a spinning disc confocal microscope ( Zeiss 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 15 ObserverZ1 with CSU - X1 , AxioCam MR camera , Plan Apochromat 25x , NA 0 . 5 , Plan NeoFluar 1 40xoil , NA 1 . 3 ) . GFPslam dynamics Fluorescent images of fixed and immunostained embryos 2 were recorded with a Zeiss LSM780 ( LCI Plan - Neofluar 63xglycerol NA 1 . 3 ) and a Zeiss 3 LSM510 ( Plan - Apochromat 63xoil , NA 1 . 4 ) . STED microscopy was performed with custom 4 made equipment ( S . Hell , Max - Planck - Institute Göttingen ) . Images were processed with 5 Fiji / ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop . Amph tubules extending from the furrow canal were scored 6 with images covering 20 to 40 FC . The proportion of the furrows with at least one Amph tubules 7 was calculated . P value was calculated by student ' s t - test . 8 9 Time - Lapse Observation of Living Pupal Wing Cells 10 Each pupa was placed on double - sticky scotch tape , and the pupal case was completely peeled off 11 with forceps and put on a 35 - mm glass - bottomed dish ( MatTek ) with the wing epithelium down . 12 The pupae were supported by wet filter paper to prevent desiccation . The dish was sealed with 13 PARAFILM . GFP / Cherry signals were imaged with a confocal spinning disc microscope 14 ( PerkinElmer ) . 15 16 Preparation of adult wings 17 Wings were dissected from adult flies and mounted in a 1 : 1 mixture of Canada Balsam and 18 methyl salicylate . Bright - field images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and the 19 Zeiss Axiovision image capture software . Auto - Montage Essentials software ( Syncroscopy ) was 20 used to automatically combine the in - focus region from a series of original images into a single 21 montaged image . 22 23 Cell culture and transfection 24 Drosophila S2R + cells were cultured and transfected as described previously ( Bogdan et al . , 25 2005 ) . For confocal spinning - disc imaging microscopy , transfected cells were replated on 26 chambered cover glass ( Lab - Tek ) pretreated with ConcavalinA ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ; Sigma ) . Image 27 sequences were processed with FIJI / ImageJ . GFP - Dia Δ DAD was expressed by cotransfection of 28 pAct - GAL4 plasmid ( actin5C promoter driving GAL4 ) . The dia RNAi experiment was 29 performed with a S2R + cell line stably expressing Cip4 - GFP ( Fricke et al . , 2009 ) . DNA in living 30 cells was stained by Hoechst dye . 31 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 16 Immunoprecipitation 1 Co - immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously ( Bogdan et al . , 2005 ) . 2 3 Biochemistry 4 Purification of ZZ - Dia ( 1 - 519 ) - His6 ( DiaN ) and ZZ - Dia ( 519 - 1091 ) - His6 ( DiaC ) was as described 5 previously ( Großhans et al . , 2005 ) . In brief , proteins were expressed in E . coli BL21DE with 6 QE80 plasmids with 0 . 5 mM IPTG at 18°C overnight . Buffer was 20 mM Na - phosphate pH 8 , 7 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole for lysis , 40 mM imidazole for washing and 500 mM for 8 elution . GST - Cip4 , GST - Cip4 Δ SH3 and GST - SH3 were expressed in E . coli with 0 . 5 mM IPTG 9 at 37°C for 4h and purified from the lysate by affinity chromatography with Glutathione 10 sepharose beads ( GSTrapHP , GE health care ) . Following buffers were used : lysis and washing 11 buffer : 50 mM Tris / HCl pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , elution buffer , 50 mM Tris / HCl pH 12 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM Glutathion . For SH3 protein NaCl was 100 mM in all 13 buffers . For GST - Cip4 and GST - Cip4 Δ SH3 the fusion proteins were cleaved overnight by 14 PreScission protease in dialysis tubing in 2 . 6x storage buffer without glycerol . The GST moiety 15 was removed by passing the solution over a Glutathione sepharose column ( GSTrapHP , GE 16 health care ) . The proteins were stored in 20 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 60 % 17 Glycerin at - 20°C . Drosophila profilin was expressed in E . coli BL21DE with pETchick ( 37°C , 18 0 . 5 mM IPTG , 4 h ) . Protein was purified from the lysate ( in P puffer : KCl 100 mM , glycine 100 19 mM , Tris / HCl 30 mM pH 8 . 0 , DTT 1 mM ) by poly - proline affinity chromatography ( Kaiser et 20 al . , 1989 ) . After extensive washing with P puffer , the protein was eluted by P buffer with 30 % 21 DMSO . Following precipitation in 2 . 4 M ammonium sulfate at 4°C , gel filtration with 22 Superdex75 ( 16 / 60 ) and concentration with vivaspin column ( MW5000 ) , the protein was stored 23 in P buffer with 60 % glycerol at - 20°C . The poly - proline affinity matrix was prepared by 24 coupling 0 . 25 g of poly - L - Proline to 3 g of CNBr - Sepharose ( GE health care ) in 12 ml 100 mM 25 NaHCO 3 / NaOH pH 8 . 3 , 300 mM NaCl for 2 h . After quenching with 0 . 1 volume of 1 M NaCl , 1 26 M glycine , 100 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 and extensive washing with water , the resin was stored in 10 27 mM Tris / HCl pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 002 % Sodium azide . The analysis of actin 28 polymerization in pyrene assays and by TIRF microscopy was essentially performed as described 29 ( Block et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , images from an Olympus IX - 81 inverted microscope were captured 30 every 2 s with exposure times of 100 ms with a Hamamatsu Orca - R2 CCD camera operated at a 31 2x2 binning mode . For comparison of nucleation efficacies , the average number of filaments was 32 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e A cc ep t ed m anu sc r i p t 17 obtained by counting actin filaments in an area of 100 x 140 µm 7 min ( or 3 min in presence of 1 profilin ) after initiation of the polymerization reaction . Elongation rates were measured by 2 manual tracking the growing filaments using ImageJ ( rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . 3 4 Acknowledgements 5 We thank C O ' Kane , K Kapp , S Luschnig , E Schejter , A Sokac , the Developmental Studies 6 Hybridoma bank at the University of Iowa , the Bloomington Drosophila stock center and the 7 Genomic Resource center at Indiana University for materials and fly stocks .
