We conducted a systematic literature review to assess child - to - child and 18 child - to - adult SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and to characterise the potential role of school 19 closures on community transmission . 1337 peer - reviewed articles published through August 20 31 , 2020 were screened ; 22 were included in this review . The literature appraised provides 21 sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in 22 community , household and school settings . Transmission by children was most frequently 23 documented in household settings , while examples of children as index cases in school 24 settings were rare . Included studies suggested that school closures may help to reduce SARS - 25 CoV - 2 transmission , but the societal , economic , and educational impacts of prolonged school 26 closures must be considered . In - school mitigation measures , alongside continuous 27 surveillance and assessment of emerging evidence , will promote the protection and 28 educational attainment of students and support the educational workforce . 29 .

MAIN TEXT 30 Introduction 31 One of the more perplexing and controversial dimensions of the COVID - 19 pandemic 32 surrounds the role of children in the transmission . Are they drivers of the pandemic , or are 33 they merely innocent bystanders , affected in myriad ways by school closures and other physical 34 distancing measures while not being generally at - risk of COVID - 19 themselves ? 35 During the first few months of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the vast uncertainty surrounding the 36 epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 led many countries globally to include school closures as part 37 of more general lockdowns . In the European Union ( EU ) / European Economic Area ( EEA ) , 38 all but two countries , Iceland and Sweden closed primary schools roughly during the period of 39 March 2020 â€“ May 2020 ( Figure 1 ) ; all EU / EEA countries closed secondary schools , to some 40 degree , during the same period ( 1 ) . These school closures were concomitant with other societal - 41 level physical distancing measures during the first wave of the COVID - 19 pandemic . 42 Available data from The European Surveillance System ( TESSy ) indicates that severe 43 outcomes from SARS - CoV - 2 infections , including fatalities , are much lower in paediatric 44 patients compared to adults ( Figure 2 ) . As of 1 November 2020 , and from over a million 45 reported COVID - 19 cases in Europe from 12 countries ( Cyprus , Estonia , Finland , Germany , 46 Ireland , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Norway , Poland and Slovakia ) , rates of 47 hospitalization and severe hospitalization ( i . e . intensive care unit admissions , respiratory 48 support or oxygen therapy ) are notably lower for children than for adults ( particularly for those 49 over 40 years of age ) , with one notable exception being hospitalization rates for infants under 50 1 year ( Figure 2 ) . Meanwhile , fatalities among children due to COVID - 19 are very rare : as of 51 1 November 2020 , across these 12 countries in the European Union and European Economic 52 Area ( EU / EEA ) , there have been 12 reported fatalities for children under 16 years of age ( of 53 67 , 701 reported cases ) , and six deaths for children between 16 and 19 years of age ( of 42 , 545 54 reported cases ) . Since September 2020 , which coincides with start of the new school year , the 55 age - specific risk of severe outcomes has fallen in all age groups ( Figure 2 , panels a - c ) . 56 Other epidemiologic indicators of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children provide a complex 57 picture regarding their potential role in the transmission chain . A systematic review concluded 58 that , based on current evidence , children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS - 59 CoV - 2 infection ( 2 ) . However , when infected and symptomatic , children appear to shed viral 60 RNA in similar quantities to adults ( 3 ) , and that younger children ( under 5 years ) with mild to 61 moderate symptoms may shed even more virus than older children and adults ( 4 ) . While the 62 proportion of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections among children in the general population 63 is uncertain , 16 % of paediatric cases in Europe were classified as asymptomatic ( 5 ) , while up 64 to 90 % of paediatric cases in China were deemed to be asymptomatic , mild , or moderate ( 6 ) . 65 It is possible that children are less often asymptomatic carriers than adults : a study of non - 66 COVID - 19 - related hospitalizations in Milan identified 1 % of children and 9 % of adults as 67 asymptomatic carriers of SARS - CoV - 2 ( 7 ) . 68 Important potential sources of evidence surrounding the role of children in the COVID - 19 69 pandemic come from studies situated in the community , household , or school settings and from 70 .

As the emerging literature may have important insights to guide decision - 71 making around school closures as well support decision making for mitigation measures in 72 household and school settings , and to complement the literature on the susceptibility of 73 children to SARS - CoV - 2 ( 2 ) , a systematic literature review was conducted to assess the role 74 of children in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 75 The primary aim of this systematic literature review was to assess child - to - child and child - to - 76 adult SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and secondarily to characterise the potential role of the 77 opening and closing of schools on community transmission . Here we outline the findings from 78 this review , while highlighting perspectives of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 79 Control ( ECDC ) on current uncertainties and research gaps , mitigation measures for schools , 80 community and household settings , and surveillance and monitoring priorities . 81 .

The methodology used 85 adhered to PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analysis ) 86 guidelines . Relevant studies published between December 2019 and August 31 , 2020 were 87 identified by searching Medline and Embase . The following set of inclusion criteria were used 88 to determine eligibility of the studies , which is based on the PCC framework ( P - Population , C - 89 Concept , C - Context ) . The study Population was restricted to people 1 - 17 years old ( excluding 90 neonatal transmission ) , the Concept was to assess child - to - child and child - to - adult 91 transmission , while the Context was to assess community , household and school transmission . 92 Subject heading terms and free text words relating to the Population , Concept and Context 93 terms as identified in the inclusion criteria were used to develop a comprehensive list of terms 94 for the search strategy ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We included all studies of quantitative 95 research , while opinion pieces , commentaries , editorials were excluded . We additionally 96 screened reference lists of the included articles to identify further relevant studies . The search 97 was limited to the English language . 98 99 Study selection 100 Initially , a pilot screening process was used where 100 identical articles were screened for their 101 eligibility independently by two reviewers to ensure consistency in screening . As a high 102 measure of inter - rater agreement was achieved between the two reviewers during the pilot 103 assessment ( percentage agreement > 90 % and / or Cohenâ€™s Kappa > 0 . 81 ) , the remaining titles 104 were randomly allocated to the two reviewers and screened for eligibility independently by 105 them . After an initial selection of the titles , each reviewer assessed each otherâ€™s selected 106 studies . The retrieved articles were then independently double - screened by two reviewers 107 based on the full text of the articles . 108 Data extraction 109 The data extraction template was piloted independently by the two reviewers on a random 110 sample of two included studies to enable an assessment of consistency in data extraction and 111 to identify where amendments needed to be made to the template . The remaining studies were 112 then data extracted independently by two reviewers , and the results were double checked across 113 the original manuscript by a third reviewer . 114 Data synthesis 115 Characteristics of the included studies were presented in tabulated form detailing the study 116 design , geographical location of the study , sample size , characteristics of the populations 117 considered , setting , context , and the findings of the study . A narrative synthesis approach was 118 applied to look systematically at the data and to describe each study categorized by the study 119 design . Patterns in the data were identified through tabulation of results , and an inductive 120 approach was taken to translate the data to identify areas of commonality between studies . 121 Mathematical modelling and simulation studies were assessed separately from those reporting 122 real - life data . 123 .

After the removal of duplicates , 1337 were screened by title / abstract , out 127 of which 102 were assessed via full text , and 22 studies subsequently included in this review . 128 Overall , 14 of the included studies reported on child - to - adult transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , 129 while eight explored the impact of school closures on the epidemiology of the COVID - 19 130 pandemic . Almost all studies ( 7 / 8 ) that assessed the impact of school closure were simulation 131 models , while all 14 studies that assessed child - to - adult transmission patterns were 132 observational in design . The PRISMA flowchart showing the flow of study selection is 133 presented in Figure 3 . 134 Child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 135 Fourteen published studies were identified to address child - to - adult transmission of SARS - 136 CoV - 2 . Two referred to transmission within a community setting , six within a household and 137 six within a school setting . 138 Community settings 139 Only one case study and one ecological study assessed child - to - adult transmission of COVID - 140 19 within a community setting . A case study by Jung et al . ( 9 ) , reported the contact - tracing 141 results of a 9 - year - old infected asymptomatic girl . A total of 1206 close and casual contacts 142 were identified of which 96 % underwent a SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test and for which the results 143 were negative for every close and casual contact , except for one adult . Goldstein & Lipsitch 144 ( 2020 ) ( 10 ) used data on COVID - 19 cases in Germany evaluated the contributing role of 145 different age groups in COVID - 19 community transmission . According to their analyses , 146 COVID - 19 cases among 10 - 14 and 15 - 19 year olds were 0 . 78 times lower and 1 . 14 times more 147 likely respectively to be a case compared to other age groups after the implementation of 148 physical distancing measures . In comparison to all age groups , individuals aged 10 - 14 years 149 had lower odds of being a case compared to adults 15 - 34 years old , while 15 - 19 year olds were 150 less likely to be a case ( OR 0 . 81 ) than 20 - 24 year olds , after the implementation of physical 151 distancing measures , including school closure . 152 Household settings 153 Four studies assessed household child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission within family 154 clusters as detailed in Table 1 . Posfay - Barbe et al . assessed the clinical presentation of the 111 155 household contacts of the first pediatric cases of COVID - 19 in Geneva , Switzerland , according 156 to which only in 3 / 39 ( 8 % ) of households the study child was the index case ( 11 ) . Similarly , 157 Teherani et al . , conducted contact tracing among household members of 32 confirmed pediatric 158 COVID - 19 cases , for which only in 7 / 32 households did children develop first symptoms of 159 COVID - 19 and were assumed as the suspected index cases ( 12 ) . Somekh et al . also investigated 160 the role of children in household COVID - 19 transmission in Israel , using a cluster of 13 161 families , and found that only in one family the index case was a child ( 13 ) . Maltezou et al . 162 noted that among 23 family clusters in Greece only in 2 families the index case was a child , 163 while there was no evidence of child - to - adult or child - to - child secondary transmission ( 14 ) . 164 .

Park et al . performed an assessment of 46 COVID - 19 index cases 166 ( three cases 0 - 9 years old and 43 cases 10 - 19 years old ) in households . For index cases under 167 9 years old , the household secondary attack rate was 5 . 3 % , the non - household 1 . 1 % and the 168 overall secondary attack rate was 2 . 1 % . On the contrary , for index cases 10 - 19 years of age , 169 the secondary attack rates were 18 . 6 % ( household ) , 0 . 9 % ( non - household ) and 9 . 8 % ( overall ) 170 ( 15 ) . An additional study from South Korea among 107 index children and 248 household 171 members , identified only one case of secondary transmission to a household member and the 172 secondary attack rate was estimated to be 0 . 5 % . In this study an additional 40 confirmed cases 173 were found in household members , but it could not be determined as a secondary transmission 174 as they had the same exposure as the pediatric index case ( 16 ) . 175 School settings 176 Six studies assessed SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a school setting the main results of which 177 are outlined in Table 3 . Heavey et al . conducted a case study in order to explore the role of 178 transmission among children in the school setting in the Republic of Ireland , before school 179 closure ( 17 ) . Three pediatric and three adult cases of COVID - 19 with a history of school 180 attendance were detected with 1155 contacts . Child - to - adult transmission or child - to - child 181 transmission was not reported in this study . Similarly Danis et al . presented the contact tracing 182 results of a nine - year - old child in France , who visited 3 different schools the first days of 183 symptom appearance . There was no evidence of secondary transmission in any of the school 184 contacts ( 18 ) . Moreover , Yung et al . traced three COVID - 19 cases ( 2 pediatric and 1 adult ) in 185 three different educational settings , and the results were negative ( 19 ) . One study from New 186 South Wales , Australia presented an overview of COVID - 19 cases and transmission in schools . 187 In a total number of 25 schools and 10 Early Childhood Educational and Care Settings , 27 188 index cases were identified , among which 12 were children and 15 staff members . Secondary 189 transmission was noted only in four out of 25 educational settings , and the overall child - to - 190 adult attack rate was estimated at 1 . 0 % . ( 20 ) . 191 Two studies reported on the regional evidence after the re - opening of schools . A school 192 outbreak in Israel after reopening of schools in May 2020 was described by Stein - Zamir et al . 193 ( 21 ) . The outbreak assessment was initiated by two pediatric COVID - 19 cases that were not 194 epidemiologically related . The results showed that 153 / 1161 students and 25 / 151 staff 195 members tested positive for COVID - 19 . However , this outbreak was attributed to crowded 196 classes , combined with the exemption of facemasks and the use of air - condition due to an 197 extreme heatwave . On the contrary , a study by Link - Gelles et al . , in Rhode Island , USA . among 198 666 child care programs that reopened on 1 June , 2020 after a 3 - month closure revealed 52 199 confirmed and probable cases ( 33 confirmed cases ) , of which 30 were among children and 22 200 among adults ( 22 ) . Secondary transmission for 10 cases was noted in only 4 / 666 childcare 201 programs , which was attributed to class distancing , the use of face masks for adults , universal 202 symptom screening daily and disinfection . 203 The impact of school closure on COVID - 19 transmission 204 Eight published studies were identified with regard to the effect of school closure on the 205 epidemiology of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the results of which are presented in Table 4 .

The 208 modelling studies in principal indicated that school closure is associated with a reduction in the 209 number of cases , a reduction of hospitalizations and ICU admissions , with the effect of school 210 closure dependent on the transmission rate , and the duration of school closure . Only one time 211 series was reported by Auger et al . assessing data collected between 9 March 2020 and 7 May 212 2020 , aiming at determining whether the closure of primary and secondary schools affects 213 COVID - 19 incidence and mortality in the USA ( 30 ) . The results ( adjusted for other enacted 214 policies and testing rates ) indicated that school closure was associated with a 62 % reduction of 215 COVID - 19 incidence per week and a 58 % reduction in mortality per week . It was found that 216 countries which had a low cumulative COVID - 19 incidence at the time of school closure , had 217 greater reductions in incidence and mortality compared to those with a higher cumulative 218 incidence at the same time . 219 220 Discussion 221 This study provides an up - to - date rapid review of the peer - reviewed literature pertaining to 222 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission by children , a topic which is a crucial input to assessments of the 223 role of school settings in COVID - 19 transmission ( 31 ) . The literature appraised in this review 224 provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 225 in both community , household and school settings . This finding is corroborated by research 226 published after the cut - off date for this review , such as a large study from India ( 32 ) . 227 Transmission of SARS - COV - 2 has thus far been documented to be higher in household settings 228 than in other community settings â€“ including schools â€“ a finding which may be potentially 229 attributable to the individual , behavioural and contextual factors of households vs . other 230 settings , as has been suggested elsewhere ( 33 ) . Meanwhile , while children are overall noted to 231 have lower rates of severe COVID - 19 cases , there is evidence of differing transmission 232 dynamics between younger vs . older children . In particular , there is some evidence that when 233 index cases , younger children , such as under 10 years of age , lead to lower secondary attack 234 rates than older children and adult . This matter warrants further investigation before concrete 235 conclusions can be drawn ( 34 , 35 ) . 236 Within our review there were limited cases in the assessed studies in which a child index case 237 was responsible for secondary transmission in schools , with the notable exception of an 238 outbreak in Israel ( 21 ) , which was associated with dense spacing , lack of the use of 239 facemasks and closed spaces with poor ventilation . On the contrary , evidence from Rhode 240 Island in the US , noted a very small number of cases after schools reopened during June - July 241 2020 , which the authors attribute to the strict non - pharmaceutical interventions implemented 242 including the use of face masks , physical distancing , screening for symptoms and classroom 243 disinfection ( 22 ) . A similar experience has been highlighted in Hong Kong , where multiple 244 potential introductions of COVID - 19 did not lead to secondary transmission , amidst a setting 245 with numerous precautionary in - school measures , such as widespread facemask use , daily 246 temperature checks , and staggered entries and exits ( 36 ) . 247 .

However , the primary endpoints in the modelling 250 studies were dependent on the transmission rate and the duration of school closure . While 251 school closure may reduce SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , the societal and economic impacts of 252 prolonged school closure are noteworthy , as they may impact the availability of the 253 healthcare workforce , ( 25 , 37 ) and may also have negative effects on children through the 254 interruption of the educational learning , social isolation , increased exposure to home 255 violence , and rise in dropout rates ( 38 ) . 256 There are important limitations to this study that may impact the direct implications for 257 decision - making . As we assessed peer - reviewed evidence published in two biomedical 258 databases , it inherently reflects the status quo of the end of the previous school year ( 2019 - 259 2020 ) due to the lag time between study implementation , peer review and publication . A further 260 limitation of this report refers to the study designs , notably case series and case reports . Finally , 261 the household studies that we assessed reflect a broad geographical and temporal range are 262 limited in comparability due to varying factors such as : background levels of community 263 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ; enrolment strategies ; household structures and social isolation 264 practices within households ; study testing rates ; and varying physical distancing policies 265 including school closures . 266 Despite these limitations , the findings presented here provide an up - to - date assessment of the 267 currently published peer - reviewed evidence . However , with an upsurge of cases in autumn 268 2020 , the likelihood of introductions of SARS - CoV - 2 into school settings increases . 269 Continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the maximum 270 protection of the health of students and the educational workforce . Where schools remain open , 271 in - school mitigation measures , particularly for schools with older children , should be adopted 272 and continually refined as new knowledge comes to light . 273 274 275 276 .

Simulation study To explore how transmission is affected by age differences altered mixing patterns owing to social distancing , and to project the impact of social distancing and school closure on COVID - 19 transmission . Scenario 1 - Vacation periods In a COVID - 19 outbreak for a baseline Ro of 2 . 5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern , the mean peak daily incidence is reduced by about 64 % . Scenario 2 - Regular weekdays with removal of all contacts : In the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed , a reduction of about 42 % was noted . Prem et al . , 2020 ( 28 ) China , Wuhan Community level / 11 million ( virtual population of Wuhan ) Simulation study To estimate the effect of physical distancing measures , including school closure on the progression of COVID - 19 Intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays reduce the cumulative infections + peak incidence and delay the peak of the outbreak . The modelled effects of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by duration of infectiousness Kim et al . , 2020 ( 25 ) Korea Community - level , simulation based on data from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Simulation study To model the effect of school opening on the COVID - 19 epidemic in South Korea . Assuming that the transmission rate increased 10 - fold after schools open , a school opening on 2 March 2020 , would lead to an additional 60 cases within one week , + 100 cases within the following two weeks . Assuming higher transmission rates lead to a higher number of cases after school opening .
