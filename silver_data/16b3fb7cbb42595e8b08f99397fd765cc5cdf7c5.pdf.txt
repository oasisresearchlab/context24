Actin filaments were assembled in cell lysates from different yeast strains ( indicated above lanes ) as described [ 22 ] , then pelleted by ultracentrifugation . The levels of actin and Srv2 in the total cell extracts and the actin pellets were determined by immunoblotting with anti - actin and anti - Srv2 antibodies . rate of actin filament disassembly ( Figure 3D ) , sug - AAP mixtures , and addition of Srv2 has the same effect as increasing the available concentration of cofilin . By gesting that Srv2 activity requires other factors in the AAP mixture . Cofilin / ADF was a logical candidate be - titrating Srv2 in the presence of 50 nM cofilin , we found that Srv2 stimulates cofilin - mediated actin disassembly cause of its central role in actin turnover . Therefore , we compared the effects of adding 100 nM Srv2 to wild - in a dose - responsive manner ( Figure 3E ) . In contrast , concentrations as high as 1 (cid:3) M C - Srv2 failed to stimu - type , srv2 (cid:1) , and cof1 - 22 AAP mixtures . The rate of actin filament disassembly increased by 50 % in wild - type and late cofilin activity ( Figure S2 ) . This result differs from the study of human CAP [ 9 ] , in which a carboxyl terminal srv2 (cid:1) AAP mixtures but only by 17 % in the cof1 - 22 AAP mixture ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , the effects of Srv2 complex fragment recycled cofilin . However , this human CAP fragment was longer and included a WH2 domain ( lack - on actin turnover correlate with levels of cofilin activity in the AAP mixtures . ing in the C - Srv2 fragment used here ) that may contrib - ute to activity . Next , we measured rates of actin filament disassem - bly in the presence of purified cofilin and / or Srv2 com - plex ( Figure 3D ) . Combining 100 nM Srv2 and 50 nM Srv2 Complex Promotes Actin Turnover by Recycling Cofilin from ADP - Actin Monomers cofilin accelerated filament depolymerization by ap - proximately 2 - fold compared to 50 nM cofilin alone . Since Srv2 / CAP has been shown to bind to actin mono - mers , we considered a mechanism for enhancement of Similar ratesof filamentdepolymerization wereobtained by increasing the concentration of cofilin to 100 nM cofilin - mediated actin turnover in which Srv2 competes with cofilin for association with ADP - actin monomers . ( Figure 3D ) . This suggests that cofilin is limiting in the Regulation of Actin Turnover In Vivo 2163 Figure 3 .

This would recycle cofilin for new rounds of filament cally recycles ADP - actin monomers from the cofilin bound state , thereby enhancing profilin - stimulated ex - severing and disassembly , increasing the rate of actin turnover . While these studies were in progress , a similar change of nucleotide ( ATP for ADP ) on monomeric actin . In contrast to the effects of Srv2 complex , 60 nM model was proposed for human CAP [ 9 ] . To test this model , we measured the rates of nucleotide exchange C - Srv2 ( and higher concentrations , not shown ) did not show this effect . These data are consistent with the on ADP - actin monomers in the presence of purified cofi - lin and / or Srv2 ( Figure 4A ) . Addition of 2 (cid:3) M cofilin to view that full - length Srv2 , but not C - Srv2 , competes efficiently with cofilin for binding to ADP - actin mono - 2 (cid:3) M ADP - actin monomers greatly reduced the rate of nucleotide exchange , as expected [ 34 , 35 ] . Addition of mers . We observed no change in the rate of nucleotide exchange on ADP - actin in the presence of 60 nM Srv2 60 nM purified Srv2 strongly reversed the inhibitory ef - fects of 2 (cid:3) M cofilin . We titrated this activity and defined alone ( no cofilin ) . This differs from the effects of 800 nM full - length human CAP , which alone stimulates nucleo - the half - maximal effect concentration to be 7 . 5 nM Srv2 ( Figure 4B ) . Srv2 also enhanced the ability of profilin to tide exchange on actin [ 9 ] . promote nucleotide exchange on cofilin bound ADP - actin monomers ( Figure 4C ) .

Intriguingly , we found that srv2 (cid:1) aip1 (cid:1) and srv2 (cid:1) cof1 - 19 double mutants were lethal ( synthetic lethal ) , whereas srv2 (cid:1) cof1 - 22 double mutants showed no additive defects . Thus , SRV2 dis - plays a synthetic lethal interaction with the pseudo wild - type allele ( cof1 - 19 ) rather than the partial loss - of - func - tion allele ( cof1 - 22 ) . As described below , biochemical experiments de - fined a cofilin - dependent actin filament capping func - tion for Aip1 and showed that this function is impaired by cof1 - 19 . This led us to test genetic interactions of capping protein ( CAP2 ) with factors that regulate actin turnover . The viable cap2 (cid:1) strain showed synthetic le - thal interactions with srv2 (cid:1) and cof1 - 22 mutant strains , but not with aip1 (cid:1) or cof1 - 19 strains . By combining our genetic data with those from previous reports ( Table S1 ) , we sorted mutant alleles by their genetic interac - tions and biochemical defects into three functional cate - gories that control actin turnover : filament capping , fila - ment depolymerization , and monomer recycling ( Table 1 ) . With only one exception , discussed below , each mu - tant in a single category is synthetic lethal with all of the mutants in the other two categories , but not with any of the alleles in its own category . From these data , Figure 4 . Srv2 Complex Catalytically Promotes Nucleotide Exchange we propose that aip1 (cid:1) , cof1 - 19 , and cap2 (cid:1) mutations on Cofilin Bound ADP - Actin Monomers all cause defects in cappingfilament barbed ends , srv2 (cid:1) ( A ) The rate of nucleotide exchange on actin was determined by and cof1 - 22 are defective in filament disassembly , and measuring etheno - ATP incorporation into 2 (cid:3) M monomeric ADP - pfy1 - 4 is defective in monomer recharging ( nucleotide actin in the presence or absence of 2 (cid:3) M cofilin , 60 nM Srv2 , and / exchange ) [ 37 ] .

Thus , loss of Srv2 reduces the rate of zation at 25 (cid:4) C and are impaired for growth at 37 (cid:4) C [ 5 , 13 , 14 , 30 , 36 , 37 ] . In contrast , aip1 (cid:1) cells and cof1 - 19 cells actin filament disassembly in vivo . Regulation of Actin Turnover In Vivo 2165 Discussion Actin turnover in vivo is controlled by the diverse activi - ties of multiple actin - associated proteins working in concert . We have demonstrated how four different actin binding proteins ( Srv2 / CAP , cofilin , profilin , and Aip1 ) cooperate to regulate actin turnover .

This agrees with ments capped at their barbed ends undergo net depoly - previous studies showing that C - Srv2 does not fully merization . As shown in Figure 5 ( raw data in Figure S3 ) , complement an srv2 (cid:1) null mutation [ 13 ] . A recent study we observed dose - responsive net depolymerization in showedthatanimportantfunctionoftheaminoterminus the presence of Aip1 , profilin , and increasing concentra - of human CAP is binding to cofilin and assisting in cofilin tions of wild - type cofilin . This activity depended on Aip1 recycling [ 9 ] . This physical interaction between Srv2 / and cofilin , consistent with formation of an Aip1 - cofilin CAP and cofilin is likely conserved in yeast based on a cap [ 11 ] . Purified Cof1 - 22 induced net depolymerization reported two - hybrid interaction [ 8 ] and our data impli - similar to wild - type Cof1 . Thus , net depolymerization cating the amino terminus of yeast Srv2 in cofilin - depen - does not require the severing / depolymerization activity dent activities . of cofilin but instead relies on capping . This is supported Defining the precise structure and mechanism of the by the ability of purified capping protein to substitute Srv2 / CAP complex presents a significant challenge for for Aip1 and cause net depolymerization in this assay the future , owing toits size , multimeric nature , and range ( Figure S4 ) .

Current Biology 2166 Figure 6 . An Integrated Model for the Regu - lation of Actin Filament Turnover The rapid turnover of actin filaments is achieved bycoordination ofmultiple proteins having diverse activities on actin . In this model , Aip1 and cofilin physically associate to cap the barbed ends of filaments recently severed by cofilin , which serves to block fila - mentreannealingandpromotenetdisassem - bly of filaments ( 1 ) . Cofilin and Aip1 activity leads to the rapid accumulation of cofilin bound ADP - actin monomers ( 2 ) . The Srv2 / CAP complex , tethered to actin filaments by Abp1 , interacts with cofilin and ADP - actin ( 3 ) and catalytically liberates ADP - actin mono - mers for nucleotide exchange , in the process recycling cofilin for further rounds of filament severing / depolymerization ( 4 ) . Liberated ADP - actin monomers undergo rapid nucleotide exchange ( ATPforADP ) , enhancedbyprofilin ( 5 ) , recharging actin monomers for new roundsofassembly . ProfilinboundATP - actin monomers polymerize readily at uncapped barbed ends of filaments ( 6 ) . Capping protein terminates elongation at barbed ends , re - stricting filament lengths . See Discussion for further details . boxyl terminus binds to actin monomers ( [ 16 – 19 ] and the observations that Cof1 - 19 has reduced affinity for Aip1 and cof1 - 19 cells have mislocalized Aip1 [ 7 ] , sug - Figure 1D ] , with additional contributions to actin mono - mer binding possibly coming from the WH2 domain . gest that Aip1 and cofilin physically associate to form a barbed end cap . Further , there are intra - and / or intermolecular interac - tions between the amino and carboxyl termini of Srv2 [ 15 , 17 , 47 ] , which may be required to build the HMW An Integrated Model for the Regulation of Actin structure and produce full activity . We speculate that Turnover In Vivo each Srv2 molecule in the complex binds to one actin In Figure 6 , we propose a model for how the factors subunit , based on the stoichiometry of actin and Srv2 in studied here are coordinated to regulate actin turnover . the complex and on 1 : 1 molar saturated Srv2 / CAP : actin Our model is similar to that of Moriyama and Yahara binding [ 16 – 19 ] .

Our model agrees with the major concept of the model of Moriyama and Yahara : Srv2 / CAP accelerates We showed that yeast Aip1 has a cofilin - dependent barbed end capping activity similar to Xenopus Aip1 the release of cofilin from actin monomers , thereby en - hancing cofilin - dependent actin turnover . However , our [ 11 ] . Okada and coworkers localized Aip1 to the barbed ends of filaments by immuno - gold labeling and showed data disagree with two aspects of their model . First , it was suggested that CAP ( in the absence of cofilin ) that Aip1 and cofilin together reduce the rate of elonga - tion at barbed ends , consistent with capping . However , increases the rate of assembly of actin monomers at filament barbed ends . We have not observed this effect itwasunclearwhetherAip1andcofilinphysicallyassoci - ate to form the cap and / or whether Aip1 preferentially for yeast Srv2 using purified proteins or in AAP mixtures ( not shown ) . Second , it was suggested that CAP directly caps cofilin - severed filaments . Our data provide new insights into this mechanism , as we used mutant alleles promotes nucleotide exchange on actin monomers . We have found no evidence for this activity ; instead , we find of cofilin to uncouple these activities . Cof1 - 19 has nor - mal severing / depolymerization activity [ 34 ] but fails to that Srv2 complex catalytically competes with cofilin for binding to ADP - actin monomers , indirectly facilitating cap filaments with Aip1 ( Figure 5 ) . Thus , filament sev - ering by cofilin is not sufficient for Aip1 capping . In nucleotide exchange ( Figure 4A ) . In our model , cofilin severs and depolymerizes actin contrast , Cof1 - 22 , whichispartiallyimpairedforfilament severing activity , was able to cap filaments with Aip1 , filaments , and an Aip1 - cofilin complex caps freshly sev - ered barbed ends to block filament reannealing . These similar to wild - type cofilin . We cannot rule out a possible requirement for filament severing in Aip1 - cofilin cap - activities lead to the rapid accumulation of cofilin bound ADP - actin monomers , which must be recharged to ATP - ping , since Cof1 - 22 is only partially impaired in severing activity [ 5 ] . However , these data , taken together with actin monomers for new assembly at free barbed ends .
