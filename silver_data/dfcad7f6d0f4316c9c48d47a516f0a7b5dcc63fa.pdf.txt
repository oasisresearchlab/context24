Recently , the sequence - to - sequence method was applied , in a general manner , to summa - rization tasks . The problem is that a large amount of information must be pre - trained for a specific domain , and information other than input statements cannot be utilized . To compensate for this shortcoming , controllable summarization has recently been in the spotlight . We introduced three properties into controllable summa - rization : 1 ) a new human - machine communication input format , 2 ) a robust constraint - sensitive summarization method for these formats , and 3 ) a practical interactive summarization interface avail - able to the user . Experiments on the Wizard - of - Wikipedia dataset show that applying this input format and the constraint - sensitive method enhances summarization performance compared to the typical method . A user study shows that the interactive summa - rization interface is practical and that participants are evaluating it positively .

It is the process of distilling important informa - tion and generating summarized text from documents . In the case of summarization using neural network structures , the summary proceeds sequence - to - sequence . The sequence - to - sequence method has the advantage of being able to learn building a summarization system by only learning data on the domain itself . However , it has the disadvantage of having to learn a large amount of data to acquire domain knowledge . In the case of abstract summarization , this learned model may have a problem of information distortion [ Huang et al . 2021 ] . In addition , except for the input statement , it is hard for the user to interfere with the output statement . To address these shortcomings , researchers have adopted a vari - ety of approaches , such as question answering [ Nan et al . 2021b ] , knowledge graph [ Zhu et al . 2021 ] , and constructive learning [ Liu et al . 2021 ] . As part of the solution to this problem , interest in con - trollable summarization methods has recently increased beyond traditional summarization . When user controllable elements are added , it is possible to create a new summary sentence with various syntaxes and contexts according to the user’s request . The summarization technique pursued in this study utilizes the following three properties for communication to control the information between the user and artificial intelligence ( AI ) . 1 ) User - machine communicative input format is defined to add con - trollable information . An intermediate format that is easy to read , both human and machine , writable , and expandable , is required . 2 ) Constraint - sensitive summarization methods are employed . User requirements must somehow be appropriately added in text sum - marization frameworks . 3 ) Interactive summarization interface is introduced to help with the communication of humans and AI , en - abling interactive co - creation with user requirements . This study introduces a novel controllable summarization framework and user interface to address these problems . Figure 1 shows the difference between the existing method and ours . For the user - machine communicative input format , a constraint markup language ( CML ) was newly proposed and developed for the constraint description of the original dialog . To highlight the important parts , we used this markup language . As demonstrated by a hyper text markup language ( HTML ) , a markup language has many advantages in adding semantic and constraint information to the dialog . The markup language form can minimize the distortion 934 IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Jung et al .

In this research , to address constraint - sensitive summarization , we employed constraint - sensitive training as well as generation - and - reranking approaches . We had to create a new summarizer , sensitive to our new input forms , where critical information was tagged in CML format . To generate the optimized summary , multiple sum - maries were generated and the summary closest to the information the user wanted was adopted . To achieve an interactive summarization interface , a user inter - face was also provided to make the generation method proposed in this paper easier for users . The user can mark the key information to be summarized through the UI and receive a summary in which the information acts as a control element . Through this co - creation process , the user can generate a summary sentence easily , and the AI participates as an assistant . Massive experiments were conducted in relation to specific food domain data of the Wizard of Wikipedia ( WoW ) [ Dinan et al . 2018 ] dataset to verify the effectiveness of CML and the proposed sum - marization frameworks . Our method proved to be better than a summarizer without CML annotated dialogue . in measuring Bilin - gual Evaluation Understudy ( BLEU ) [ Papineni et al . 2002 ] , Recall - Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation ( ROUGE ) [ Lin 2004 ] , and BERTScore [ Zhang * et al . 2020 ] . Specifically , our proposed method performed better on baselines up to 9 . 87 measured by BLEU - 4gram , 10 . 24 by ROUGE - L , and 1 . 83 by BERTScore . In the user study , the participants judged our interactive summarization interface as useful . In this paper , Section 2 discusses previous studies conducted in this area . Sections 3 and 4 describe the detailed structure of the proposed methodology , and Sections 5 and 6 describe the data used and experimental settings for the neural network . Section 7 describes the user experience and user evaluation of the interface . Section 8 describes the result of the experiments . Finally , Section 9 concludes the entire paper . 2 RELATED WORKS 2 . 1 Human - AI Collaborative Generation Recently , the performance of deep generative neural network mod - els has increased significantly . This development has led to practical research on the benefits humans can obtain using these systems . Studies are being conducted in various fields in which humans and systems proceed with generation together using this generation model . There are many studies on co - generation , such as image - oriented generation [ Davis et al . 2016 ; Karimi et al . 2019 ; Oh et al . 2018 ] , video game content creation [ Guzdial et al . 2019 ] , and design generation [ Koch et al . 2019 ] . Voice may be generated for input such as text or converted into text when voice is the input . In ad - dition , various deep learning - based generation systems are being studied for user convenience , such as generating music [ Huang et al . 2020 ; Louie et al . 2020 ; Suh et al . 2021 ] for inputs that meet certain conditions or automatically generating meeting minutes [ Liu et al . 2020 ] . The commonality of these systems is that the user takes the initiative to use the AI system for support . This study was conducted with these points in mind . 2 . 2 Human - AI Collaborative Text Generation One of the main input and output types utilized by AI systems is text , as text is an objective input form that includes human intention and can be handled easily , not being limited to the surrounding environment . As such , many studies on text - text generation are being conducted . When the user inputs text , the intention is to obtain the desired result . When a specific keyword is an input , it may be combined to generate a sentence , or when a user inputs a word through an input device , multiple words that are likely to be 935 Interactive User Interface for Dialogue Summarization IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia used can be generated and recommended next . Gmail’s automatic reply recommendation system [ Kannan et al . 2016 ] and Google Translator [ Wu et al . 2016 ] are common commercial applications . 2 . 3 Encoder / Decoder - based Neural Summarization AI is used especially in summary systems for various texts . There are two main types of summary systems : 1 ) extractive summa - rization that extracts key sentences and proceeds with a simple concatenation and 2 ) abstractive summarization that generates a new summary for the entire set of sentences . These summariza - tion systems are being studied in multiple data domains . They are used not only for summaries of common news articles [ Gupta et al . 2022 ] , but also for conversation summaries [ Zhong et al . 2022 ] as well as medical document or dialogue summaries [ DeYoung et al . 2021 ; Yadav et al . 2022 ] . Among them , systems that provide user summary results are also commercialized . 2 . 4 Language Model - based Applications As the size of the deep learning model gradually increases , large - scale language models [ Brown et al . 2020 ; Raffel et al . 2020 ; Shoeybi et al . 2019 ] are being developed . As data on colloquial text increases due to the commercialization of chat and messenger , various tasks on spoken languages are being studied , such as automatically re - sponding to chat , [ Chao and Lane 2019 ; Oluwatobi and Mueller 2020 ] . In particular , an interface in the form of generating answers , as if talking to a user , has been studied [ Shuster et al . 2022 ; Smith and Dragone 2022 ] . 2 . 5 Constraint - based Text Generation The constraint can be defined differently according to the charac - teristics of various texts . Both syntax and semantic characteristics can be referred to , as defined and used by many researchers . For example , there is a study using a word that must be included [ Fan et al . 2017 ] or selecting a style such as a colloquial or written lan - guage [ Ficler and Goldberg 2017 ] or alternatively using generated text length [ Saito et al . 2020 ; Takeno et al . 2017 ] as a constraint . Rendering constraint as input is the simplest form of applying a constraint to a neural network . For training a controllable neural network , one or multiple constraints are appended to the header or the footer as input to the neural network [ Gupta et al . 2020 ; Su et al . 2021a ; Takeno et al . 2017 ] . As an automatic sentence generation system using constraints , [ Vig et al . 2021 ] provides multiple summaries on the document . This system shows the novel words in the summary that do not appear in the source document , but are semantically similar to a token in the source document , and stopwords that are not used in the matching algorithms . Although the system is similar to ours in that it provides information about word distortion common in abstract summarization , our system is different in that it produces new summaries by newly manipulating distorted information . 3 USER GUIDED DIALOGUE SUMMARIZATION WITH INTERACTIVE INTERFACE The interactive summarization pursued in this study has the fol - lowing characteristics : 1 ) the definition of the type of summary constraint meets the needs of the machine - user , 2 ) the definition of the intermediate format is comprehensible to both users and machines , 3 ) the improved sequence - to - sequence summary method can react sensitively and accurately to these constraints , and 4 ) the user interfaces are in the user - available form of the controllable summarization framework . 3 . 1 Controllable Text Generation When generating sentences using a transformer - based encoder - decoder model [ Vaswani et al . 2017 ] , it is not easy to provide ad - ditional important information to the model until the output for a particular input is obtained . There can be various criteria for such information requiring additional inputs . Typical abstractive summarization provides a more natural con - text than extractive summarization ; however , the problem of the possible increase of information distortion arises [ Nan et al . 2021a ] . To address this problem , we have defined the concept of information consistency that takes the information that users want to keep as is . In this study , we considered the various constraints the user would generally want to be reflected in summary . The important challenge of summarization is the consistency of information . To maintain information consistency , this study aims to respect the information that users want to maintain . For this goal , the keywords and key phrases described in the summary are defined as constraints . • Word Positive ( WP ) : Essential keywords to include in the summary without distorting the sentence . • Part Positive ( PP ) : Key topic sentences or phrases in the summary that is possible to change in a sentence as long as the information is maintained . 3 . 2 Constraint Markup Language An input format , jointly understandable by machine and user , is significant and challenging to create . For more user - desirable sum - marization , we considered an input form that could express the important information in the original text . Several researchers have already devised such a method [ Gupta et al . 2021 ; Su et al . 2021b ] , but most are arranged with the location in front of the original text . We propose a novel way for putting together the context location in - formation that is readable both by humans and AI , human - writable and expandable . In this study , we propose CML as a control interface . CML is the constraint description format that uses markup tags to express semantic and syntax constraints , which guide summarization mod - ules on how to generate summaries . The markup tags cover a wide range - characters , words , sentences , and entire documents , among others . The tag is expressed on the original document as a format of < tag > < / tag > just like HTML . This markup language is easy for humans to read / write and can be used as a parser or as input to a machine . 936 IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Jung et al .

An interactive dialogue interface for participants can be viewed here as part of the study . 937 Interactive User Interface for Dialogue Summarization IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia We further introduce two tags - < WP > and < PP > - for word - level and part - level ( multi - words ) , respectively , to describe key con - straints for summarization . The Word Positive ( < WP > ) tag specifies which word should be contained in the output summary , and Part Positive ( < PP > ) tag specifies which part of the document should be generated in the summary . Normally , the < PP > tag covers sentence - level information . 3 . 3 Constraint - Sensitive Summarization Method For the controllable generation task , a new summarizer , sensitive to the new input forms had to be created with critical information tagged in CML format . This section describes the training , gener - ation , and evaluation methods used to train the constraint in the neural network using pre - training and fine - tuning input format with CML . The sentences are generated from the decoder cover , given the constraints , but the results may not be coherent with the given semantics since the decoder tends to choose the best , based on language model probabilities . To generate CML - consistent re - sults , reranking is performed after generation steps . The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2 . 3 . 3 . 1 Constraint - Sensitive on General Domain . The input format proposed in this study is a form with many advantages , but it is a new input format . Therefore , the performance of typical lan - guage models is not sufficient for CML . As shown in Figure 2b , the CML - sensitive model was pre - trained , using a transformer - based encoder - decoder architecture as a trainer . The trainer inherits a typical sequence - to - sequence framework , encodes the source CML annotated dialogue as input , and then generates the target summary 𝑆 with the decoder . The operation of the summarizer is described in the CML anno - tated dialogue along with the 𝑆 , 𝐷 = ( CML 1 , S 1 ) . . . ( CML | D | , S | D | ) where each instance is a < 𝐶𝑀𝐿 𝑖 , 𝑆 𝑖 > pair . During the training phase , model parameters are trained to maximize the log - likelihood of the outputs in a parallel training corpus ( 𝐷 ) : ∑︁ ( CML , S ) ∈ D logp ( S | CML , 𝜃 ) ( 1 ) where 𝜃 is the model parameter . The decoder generates an abun - dance of sentences given the CML annotated dialogue . Automatic CML Generator . We created a system to automatically collect keywords and key phrases based on the answer summary to structure data in CML form . In the case of keywords , Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) was used to take an intersection between words collected from the summary and the set of words collected from the original dialog . In the case of key phrases , the sentence , with the longest sequence matching , was collected by matching the summary and the original dialog . Keywords and key phrases collected in this process were tagged as < WP > and < PP > , respectively . 3 . 3 . 2 Constraint - sensitive on Target Domain . The CML - sensitive pre - trained model was trained on the overall dialogue corpus . After that , fine - tuning was undertaken to learn more specific words or essential phrases that appear for a specific domain . In this study , we fine - tuned the model using CML annotated dialogues and sum - maries in the target domain . The training method and objective function of the CML fine - tuning model are the same as those of the CML - sensitive pre - trained model . 3 . 3 . 3 Summary Optimization for Constraints . To provide an opti - mized summary including the information desired by the user , the summary was selected through additional algorithms in this study . To achieve controllability , we adopted a generation - and - reranking approach such that , 1 ) a number of summaries are generated , 2 ) information satisfaction for the summary is evaluated , and 3 ) the final summary is selected after reranking according to the evaluated score . This method generates a summary that is most consistent with the information desired by the user . In the generation step , given an input sequence CML annotated dialogue , our model generates multiple summaries that serve as weakly satisfied CML constraints . During the decoding process , the decoder adopts a beam search strategy of the current best hypothe - sis at each time step . In this work , we propose new constraint evaluation metrics that satisfy the < WP > and < PP > tags in CML for controllable dialogue summarization tasks : WP - Accuracy and PP - ROUGE - L . • WP - Accuracy computes the average accuracy of whether the < WP > tags exist in the generated summaries . In evalu - ating the exact value matching , if < WP > tags in the CML annotated dialog were reflected in generated summary , we were judged to be True , and if not , False . • PP - ROUGE - L calculates the ROUGE - L score between gener - ated summaries and < PP > annotated dialogue . More detailed descriptions of the ROUGE - L score can be seen in Section 6 . 2 . In the reranking step , the reranker selects the top - 𝑁 summaries based on the WP - Accuracy or PP - ROUGE - L score . The appropriate summary may be selected from methods that reflect only WP - Accuracy , PP - ROUGE - L , or the sum of the two scores . In this study , we use the sum of the two scores . The multiple generated sum - maries are then reranked with our new metrics , WP - Accuracy and PP - ROUGE - L . Figure 3 shows a simple example of the process of reranking the generated sentences . 4 UX PATTERNS FOR INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE SUMMARIZATION In this study , we provide an application tool for the user to easily and quickly transform the input format of the constraint - sensitive neural summarizer . The application tool is configured in the form of a web . Users can then use the following tools . When the user designates the text and important keywords , the service uses a form to output an interactive reflected summary . CML is automatically generated internally in the format of the model input when the user clicks the completion button after displaying the keyword in the text in the form of a drag . Subsequently , a summary result for this is provided to the user . This UX pattern may be repeated until a summary result , satisfactory to the user , is obtained . The total flow is displayed in Figure 4 . 938 IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Jung et al .

Dialogue with User Tagging Dialogue with User Tagging Figure 4 : User interface for interactive dialogue summarization . Users can control information by dragging and clicking to generate summaries . This process is repeated until the user is satisfied . 4 . 1 Automatic tagged Dialogue Viewer The service provides users with a dialogue with two speakers on a single topic and automatically generated keywords and key phrases . For the demonstration , we first collected the keywords and key phrases on a limited test data set . We collect the summaries auto - matically generated by 3 different pre - trained models . With those summaries , keywords are extracted from noun intersection using an AI - based part - of - speech tagger . Key phrases are tagged by the longest common subsequence algorithm with the dialogue and answer summary . Users can check the dialogues and highlighted keywords and key phrases , to initially decide on the crucial part . 4 . 2 Constraint Tagging Among automatically generated keywords , incorrectly generated keywords may be changed by the user . Keywords irrelevant to the topic can be deleted , or information that must be included can be added . Even if the range is incorrectly tagged , such as when only " Pizza " is tagged among " Pepperoni Pizza " , the keyword can be deleted and added again by changing the range . The tagging interface of keywords and key phrases are provided separately . However , the UX patterns are the same . The user may independently configure keywords and key phrases . 4 . 3 Interactive Summarization After the user finishes tagging , when the user presses the comple - tion button , the key phrases tagged by the user are reflected in the dialogue in the format of CML . The CML is entered as input into the model , and the model generates summaries reflecting the key phrases . The user can repeat the above process until the generated summary is satisfactory . Figure 5 describes this entire process with the example dialogue . 5 DATASETS This section introduces the datasets used for CML - sensitive pre - trained models and fine - tuning models . For training , the dialogue - summary pairs were used . To demonstrate the effectiveness of our CML methods on summarization datasets , we chose SAMSum [ Gliwa et al . 2019 ] and WoW . Statistics of dialogue datasets are shown in Table 1 . 5 . 1 Pre - training Datasets SAMSum is a dialogue summary dataset that contains dialogues from real life . Although the data summaries provide accurate infor - mation about the dialogue , these are only short dialogues . WoW is a rich dialogue dataset in which two speakers talk about a specific topic , but do not provide summaries . 939 Interactive User Interface for Dialogue Summarization IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 ,

So we built summaries automatically , using summarization mod - els : text - to - text transfer transformer ( T5 ) 1 [ Raffel et al . 2019 ] , bidi - rectional and auto - regressive transformer ( BART ) 2 [ Lewis et al . 2019 ] , and BART - sum 3 models . We used a summary sentence with the highest proportion of positive words which consists of a noun set that is an intersection of the dialogue and summary . The se - lected summary ratio of each model was T5 : 3 . 0 % , BART : 61 . 6 % , BART - sum : 35 . 2 % . 5 . 2 Fine - tuning Datasets As data for fine - tuning , we wanted to build a dialogue dataset for the specific target domain from WoW data . For this purpose , among 22 , 311 total topics in the WoW dataset , the data were filtered and used for 29 topics related to food . We defined the filtered data as the WoW - food dataset , whereby a training and test set were constructed by dividing in a ratio of 8 : 2 . 6 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS 6 . 1 Implementation Details 6 . 1 . 1 Constraint - sensitive Summarizer Details . Our approach can adopt all generation models which can generate sentences corre - sponding to a given input sequence . The transformer - based encoder - decoder language models were selected for the constraint - sensitive summarization : T5 and BART . T5 is an encoder - decoder architec - ture using the text - to - text format as input to generate target text . BART is an encoder - decoder transformer model pre - trained on a large corpus using a denoising auto - encoder task that first uses 1 https : / / huggingface . co / bhuvaneswari / t5 - small - text _ summarization 2 https : / / huggingface . co / slauw87 / bart _ summarisation 3 https : / / huggingface . co / philschmid / bart - large - cnn - samsum a noise - added source text as input and subsequently uses a lan - guage model for reconstructing the original text by predicting the true replacement of corrupted tokens . The T5 and BART mod - els show excellent performance when used for natural language generation ( NLG ) tasks . For pre - training and fine - tuning the CML - sensitive summarizer , the CML annotated dialogue was fed to the encoder , and the decoder produced summaries satisfying the con - straint of the input . Figure 6 shows the overall input and output design of the summarizer . For implementation , we used T5 - small 4 and BART - base 5 . 6 . 1 . 2 Decoding . When decoding at test time , beam search was used to generate candidate summaries with a size of { 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 30 , 50 , 100 } .

We measured the quality of summarization commonly adopted for evaluating natural language generation system , including BLEU and ROUGE - L , to assess the co - herence of generated summaries . BLEU is a corpus - level precision - focused metric that calculates n - gram overlap between the reference and generated summaries and includes a brevity penalty ( BP ) . N is the maximum length of n - grams considered , BLEU - 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 mea - sures the overlap of unigrams / bigrams / trigrams / four - grams about single tokens . The BLEU score as follows : 𝐵𝑃 = 𝑒 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( 1 − 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ( 𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 − 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ( 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 − 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 ) , 𝑜 ) ( 2 ) 𝐵𝐿𝐸𝑈 = 𝐵𝑃 ∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑘 = 1 𝑤 𝑘 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑝 𝑘 ) ) ( 3 ) 𝑘 is the number of n - grams and 𝑤 𝑘 is the positive weight sum - ming to one . 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ( 𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 - 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 ) and 𝑙𝑒𝑛 ( 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 - 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 ) refer to the length of the reference and generated summary , respectively . 𝑝 𝑘 means the n - gram precisions . Initially , ROUGE is proposed to test the effectiveness of auto - matic summarization of long texts containing multiple sentences by comparing the overlap of n - grams , word sequences , and word pairs . In this study , we used the ROUGE - L version , which calcu - lates the recall for the longest common subsequence ( LCS ) between the reference and generated summaries . The LCS is a set of words that occur in two sentences in the same order , but unlike n - grams , these words do not have to be contiguous , i . e . , there can be ordered words between the terms of the LCS . Given a reference summary consisting of 𝑚 words and a generated summary of length 𝑛 , the ROUGE - L score is calculated as the weighted harmonic mean of 𝑅 𝐿𝐶𝑆 and 𝑃 𝐿𝐶𝑆 as follows : 𝑅 𝐿𝐶𝑆 = 𝐿𝐶𝑆 ( 𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 - 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 , 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 - 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑚 ( 4 ) 𝑃 𝐿𝐶𝑆 = 𝐿𝐶𝑆 ( 𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 - 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 , 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 - 𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑛 ( 5 ) 𝛽 = 𝑃 𝐿𝐶𝑆 𝑅 𝐿𝐶𝑆 ( 6 ) 𝑅𝑂𝑈𝐺𝐸 - 𝐿 = ( 1 + 𝛽 2 ) 𝑅 𝐿𝐶𝑆 𝑃 𝐿𝐶𝑆 𝑅 𝐿𝐶𝑆 + 𝛽 2 𝑃 𝐿𝐶𝑆 ( 7 ) 942 IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Jung et al . 6 . 2 . 2 Embedding - based Metric . The n - gram overlap - based evalua - tion relies on string matching ; we cannot identify paraphrases of the word like " expensive " and " costly . " Additionally , we used the se - mantic matching metrics BERTScore . BERTScore is an embedding - based metric that is more robust to changes in the surface forms of the words than BLEU and ROUGE - L . BERTScore measures soft overlap between contextual bidirectional encoder representations from transformer ( BERT ) [ Devlin et al . 2019 ] embeddings of tokens between the reference and the generated summaries . 6 . 2 . 3 Constraint - based Metrics . In addition , we adopted constraint satisfaction evaluation metrics especially designed for the control - lable dialogue summarization task to evaluate the quality of < WP > and < PP > tags in CML , WP - Accuracy and PP - ROUGE - L mentioned in Section 3 . 3 . 3 . 6 . 3 Model Baseline We compared our model with the baseline . For the baseline , the original dialogues without CML annotated tags were fed to the model , and the decoder generated a summary . The architecture and training method of baseline ( Figure 6a and CML - sensitive fine - tuning models ( Figure 6b ) are the same ; only the input design is different . The baseline was trained with the same experimental settings as those of fine - tuning in Table 2 . Web - based CML - based summarizer services that users can access were built , using the CML - sensitive fine - tuning model . 7 USER STUDY Based on the augmented model introduced earlier , we devised a web - based service that users can access . The following UI service utilization experiment was conducted to verify how helpful these interactive conversation summary services are to actual users . 7 . 1 Methodology Werecruited31participantsinterestedinAI - relatedsystemsthrough a notice posted at our institution . Participants were tested without receiving any other compensation . Information was collected on their gender and age ( Figure 7a ) , English level ( Figure 7b ) , the high - est level of education ( Figure 7c ) , knowledge level on AI ( Figure 7d ) , and major ( Figure 7e ) . They were unaware of the content of this paper and dialogue summarization interfaces . We provided the user interface and asked them to use it for 10 minutes to proceed with the summary of the sample dialogues . The experiment was conducted on the following three cases . The user was presented with five different dialogues and generated a summary of them using the appropriate tool to suit the required topic . • Summaries generated immediately from dialogue without additional input . ( Baseline ) • Summaries generated from the CML automatically tagged constraints . ( Auto CML ) • Summaries generated from the interactive CML tagged con - straints by the user . ( Interactive CML ) 7 . 2 Evaluation The researchers tried to determine the users’ reactions to the interac - tive summarization interface through a survey . An actual interview on the service was conducted with 31 users using a Likert scale of 1 - 5 points based on the system usability scale ( SUS ) [ Brooke et al . 1996 ] questionnaire . The questions asked in the usability question - naire were as follows : ( 1 ) I think that I would like to use this system frequently . ( 2 ) I found that the system is unnecessarily complex and unintu - itive . ( 3 ) I thought the system was easy to use . ( 4 ) I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this method . ( 5 ) I found the various functions in this system well - integrated . ( 6 ) I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system . ( 7 ) I imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly . ( 8 ) I found the system very cumbersome to use . ( 9 ) I felt very confident using the system . ( 10 ) I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system . 8 RESULTS The purpose of this study was to combine three elements to make it easier for the user to summarize the conversation . The three ele - ments consisted of : 1 ) an efficient new controllable input form , CML , that both users and machines could understand ; 2 ) a constraint - sensitive summarizer that could respond to this input form ; 3 ) an interactive summarization interface that would allow users to easily co - create summaries with AI . 8 . 1 Effects of Constraint Sensitive Summarization using CML To verify the effectiveness of the CML annotated dialogues of the proposed method , the model was compared with the baseline . The generated top - 1 summary was evaluated after reranking . The per - formances of BLEU , ROUGE - L , BERTScore , WP - Accuracy , and PP - ROUGE - L are reported as an evaluation of the quality of the gener - ated summaries . Our experiment involved training on 1 ) the baseline without CML annotated data , 2 ) only CML - sensitive fine - tuning , and 3 ) CML - sensitive pre - training and fine - tuning . Our reranking strategy can be categorized into three groups : ( 1 ) SUM : the sum of WP - Accuracy and PP - ROUGE - L scores ; ( 2 ) WP : only WP - Accuracy ; ( 3 ) PP : only PP - ROUGE - L . Table 3 shows the experimental results on the WoW - food test set . Overall , the CML - sensitive models performed better than the the baseline . When using CML - sensitive pre - trained models , all evaluation scores improved significantly , suggesting that the pro - posed method helps summarizers capture the constraints . The CML - sensitive pre - training + fine - tuning models achieved the best scores . The experimental results for more settings are shown in Appendix A . Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the average performance of summa - rization of T5 and BART .

food test set . The reranking strategy is SUM ( sum of WP - Accuracy and PP - ROUGE - L ) . For short , B and R refer to BLEU and ROUGE , respectively . The results were averaged over five random runs . The highest numbers are in bold . 8 . 2 Effects of Interactive User Interface Figure 10a shows the result of the scoring . Looking at the score distribution of users’ survey results , our UI generally scored high on questions 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 , which are positive questions , and low on questions 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 , which are negative questions . This tendency shows that the users generally had positive feelings for our UI . Figure 10b is the score of participant satisfaction with the summary function of the system on a Likert scale of 1 - 5 points . The median satisfaction score was 4 . This is a high score indicating that users judged our system positively . In addition , we asked participants to choose the most preferred of the three summaries : Baseline , Auto CML , and Interactive CML . This distribution can be seen in Figure 10c with 68 % of all users , more than a majority , preferring CML . In particular , interactive CML was the most preferred summarization method .

Beam size ( x - axis ) is the number of results used for reranking ; w / WP + PP , w / WP , and w / PP refer to the training of the CML corpus with each tag version ; w / WP + PP means the model was trained on constraint markup language ( CML ) using annotated data containing WP and PP tags ; w / WP means the CML annotated data used only WP tags ; and w / PP means the CML annotated data used only PP tags . preferred baseline citing " because it’s annoying to modify it di - rectly " and " convenient because it’s automatically processed . " For those who preferred CML cited , " A summary depends on what the word difference alone focuses on , adding and deleting the desired words or sentences , excluding unimportant parts of the entire con - versation flow or focusing on what they want " and " When I checked the results of the summary , it came out well similar to the summary I thought . " as the reasons . Figure 11a shows the number of submissions made by users made for one original text in the system . 61 % of users received satisfactory results with fewer than three submissions . Figure 11b and 11c show the number of modifications made in the system to WP and PP for one original text . In general , for those who were satisfied with Auto CML , few modifications were made , and there were slightly more people making corrections to fewer than three keywords . 8 . 3 Case Study A case study was performed to understand the performance of our method better . Table 4 shows the generated summaries for baseline , only CML - sensitive fine - tuning , and CML - sensitive pre - training + fine - tuning in the WoW - food dataset on the T5 model . Comparing the generated summaries , all models could generate fluent and natural sentences . However , the models that adopted the CML - annotated dialogue as input format - only CML - sensitive fine - tuning and CML - sensitive pre - training + fine - tuning , could satisfy more constraints . This confirms our method’s efficiency in generating a more controllable and constraint - sensitive summary . 946 IUI ’23 , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Jung et al .

To generate an interactive and information - consistent summary , three properties were defined . We proposed a new user - machinecommunicativeinputformatcalledCML , constraint - sensitive summarization methods , and an interactive summarization inter - face for human - AI co - generation . Experimental results show that the CML and constraint - sensitive models provide useful informa - tion , increasing abstractive dialogue summarization performance . In the user study , the interactive summation interface proved effec - tive . In addition , participants found the interactive summarization interface to be more helpful than the baseline which generated in the traditional sequence - to - sequence method . Our results provide lessons and insights into human and AI co - generation systems and suggest several directions for future research . In particular , we find that the automatic generation of the speaker can be distorted in the dialogue summarization task . We can solve these problems by expanding our methodology . In addition , research will be conducted to expand the techniques introduced in this study on summarizing , to other domains not limited to conversation summary .
