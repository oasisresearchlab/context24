For pluripotent stem cells , an initial critical differentiation event is specification to one of three germ lineages : endoderm , meso - derm , and ectoderm . Differentiation is known to be regulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular factors , but the role of the cytoskeleton during specification , or early differentia - tion , is still unknown . In these studies , we used agonists and antagonists to modulate actin polymerization and the actin - myosin molecular motor during spontaneous differentiation of embryonic stem cells in embryoid bodies . We found that inhibiting either actin polymeriza - tion or actin - myosin interactions led to a decrease in differentiation to the mesodermal line - age and an increase in differentiation to the endodermal lineage . Thus , targeting processes that regulate cytoskeletal tension may be effective in enhancing or inhibiting differentiation towards cells of the endodermal or mesodermal lineages , which include hepatocytes , islets , cardiomyocytes , endothelial cells , and osteocytes . Therefore , these fundamental findings demonstrate that modulation of the cytoskeleton may be useful in production for a range of cell - based therapies , including for liver , pancreatic , cardiac , vascular , and orthopedic applications . Introduction Understanding directed differentiation is critical for the proper and efficient development of stem cell - based tissue engineering therapies . The emergence of personalized medicine , based on induced pluripotent stem cells , has increased the importance of determining the regulators of the early differentiation events that occur with loss of pluripotency . Specification to one of the three germ lineages ( ectoderm , endoderm , or mesoderm ) is the critical first step in direct - ing differentiation to downstream functional phenotypes . Therefore , identifying means to reg - ulate early specification can be important in effectively promoting downstream differentiation to therapeutically - relevant phenotypes . Stem cell differentiation is a complex process regulated both spatially and temporally by numerous extracellular and intracellular factors .

The senior author [ TA ] filaments . In mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) the use of small molecule antagonists to disrupt actin polymerization [ 1 ] or actin - myosin interactions [ 2 ] resulted in an increase in adipogenic differentiation and a decrease in osteogenic differentiation . During the differentiation process , however , the timing of specific cues can have alternate effects dependent on cell state . To gen - erate cardiac progenitors from pluripotent stem cells , for example , the Wnt signaling pathway must be activated early but inhibited later [ 3 ] . Application of cyclic compression to multipo - tent MSCs promoted chondrogenic differentiation while the same mechanical cue inhibited chondrogenic differentiation in more naïve cells derived from pluripotent stem cells [ 4 ] . While actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions have been shown to regulate multi - potent stem cell differentiation , it is unknown if or how those cytoskeletal processes regulate differentiation of naïve pluripotent stem cells . Previous studies in pluripotent stem cells have investigated the role of actin polymerization or actin - myosin interactions on self - renewal and pluripotency under expansion conditions meant to inhibit differentiation . In those studies , inhibition of the Rho / Rock pathway , which regulates actin - myosin contractility or inhibition of actin - myosin interactions , directly increased cell survival and cloning efficiency [ 5 , 6 ] , as well as increased expression of pluripotency markers [ 5 ] . Inhibition of actin polymerization also increased pluripotent stem cell survival but did not increase cloning efficiency [ 6 ] . Despite this extensive evaluation in the pluripotent state , the role of actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions has yet to be determined in pluripotent stem cells during early germ lineage specification and downstream differentiation . Incomplete reprogramming and uncharacterized residual properties from the parental phenotype currently complicate the use of induced pluripotent stem cell populations in funda - mental studies of early differentiation [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] . The role of the cytoskeleton in germ lineage speci - fication can therefore be more readily elucidated in a well characterized embryonic stem cell population . Using embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) that were more homogenous than an induced population , we found that pluripotent stem cells have minimal structural organization and low levels of cytoskeletal expression [ 10 ] . Expression of actin and intermediate filaments then increased with differentiation of these ESCs under multiple 2D and 3D culture conditions [ 11 ] . To determine if the cytoskeleton regulates differentiation to the germ lineages , however , requires selection of a suitable in vitro model . Use of the embryoid body model allows for study of spontaneous germ lineage differentiation in a 3D in vitro configuration that self - assembles similar to the in vivo process [ 12 ] , avoiding additional artifacts associated with 2D culture such as restriction to monolayer growth and adherence to a protein - coated stiff surface . The focus of these studies was to modulate the cytoskeleton and evaluate its role during early differentiation . In particular , our objective was to determine the effects of agonists and antagonists of actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions ( Fig 1 ) on germ lineage specification during spontaneous ESC differentiation as embryoid bodies . Overall , we found that actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions can serve as targets to modulate dif - ferentiation to mesodermal and endodermal phenotypes . Materials and methods Embryonic stem cell culture Mouse D3 embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ; ATCC™ , Manassas , VA ) were cultured as described previously [ 13 ] . Briefly , cells were cultured on gelatin - coated tissue culture plastic with medium that consisted of Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagles Medium , 15 % ESC - qualified fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , 0 . 1 mM non - essential amino acids , antibiotics , and 1000 U / ml leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ; EMD Millipore , Temecula , CA ) .

In experimental samples the medium was supple - mented with one or more of the following small molecules : jasplakinolide ( JASP ; 50 nM ; Millipore ) , cytochalasin D ( CYTO D ; 0 . 2 μM ; Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , calyculin A ( CAL A ; 1 nM ; Santa Cruz , Dallas Texas ) , or blebbistatin ( BLEBB ; 24 μM in 3D ; Sigma Aldrich ) . Control samples for each group were instead supplemented with a matched volume of solvent ( final concentration of < 0 . 15 % DMSO ) . Compared to controls , treatment with these small molecules did not notably increase cell death ( S1 Fig ) . Treatment with supple - mented medium was applied for 3 days ( Days 4 – 7 ) after which samples were assessed for mor - phology or differentiation . Morphological assessment Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to determine the morphology of the EBs and the differentiating cells within . Both treated and untreated samples were fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaral - dehyde and a 1 % osmium tetroxide / 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate solution ( Sigma Aldrich 1 ) . EBs were then fractured , dehydrated , and sputter - coated with gold or carbon . Images were taken on a Hitachi 4800 system . Gene expression Samples were evaluated for gene expression as described previously [ 13 ] . For each sample , 1 μg of RNA was isolated , converted into cDNA , and analyzed using standard real - time PCR with SYBR 1 Green on a StepOnePlus™ PCR System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . Primers were designed to assess mesodermal differentiation ( mesenchyme homeobox 1 : Meox1 ; paired box gene 2 : Pax2 ; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 : Flk1 ) and endo - dermal differentiation ( SRY - Related HMG - Box Transcription Factor : Sox17 ; Forkhead Box A2 : FoxA2 ; alpha - fetoprotein : Afp ) . Gene expression levels were determined using stan - dard curves and reported normalized to glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Gapdh ) . Results are presented normalized to solvent matched controls . Protein expression Protein expression was determined using standard protocols of immunohistochemistry . Both treated and control EB samples were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde , paraffin embedded , and sec - tioned ( 6 μ m thick ) onto slides . Slide sections were then deparaffinized , heat - denatured , blocked for non - specific binding with serum , and then stained with primary and secondary antibodies , as well as HOECHST 33258 as a nuclear counterstain . Primary antibodies were against FLK1 ( Santa Cruz ) or AFP ( Santa Cruz ) and secondary antibodies were conjugated with AF488 or AF546 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Images were then taken with either an Olympus 1 fluorescent microscope or Nikon A1 Confocal microscope using identical voltage settings and conditions to image a particular protein in all samples . Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean . Comparisons between treated sam - ples and their matched controls were analyzed using a student’s t - test for 3 – 4 replicates from each independent experimental trial , with multiple trials for the single treatment groups . P - val - ues < 0 . 05 were considered significant .

Sponta - neously differentiating EBs were treated from Day 4 to 7 ( and assessed at Day 7 ) with reagents known to be agonists and antagonists of these cytoskeletal processes ( Figs 1 and 2A ) . Actin fil - ament formation was perturbed with jasplakinolide ( JASP ) to prevent depolymerization [ 14 ] or cytochalasin D ( CYTO D ) to inhibit polymerization [ 15 ] , resulting in extended or shortened actin filaments , respectively . The actin - myosin molecular motor was modulated with calyculin A ( CAL A ) to inhibit deactivation of myosin [ 16 ] or blebbistatin ( BLEBB ) to inhibit binding of myosin to actin [ 17 ] , resulting in increased and decreased actin - myosin interactions , respec - tively . Effects on morphology and differentiation were evaluated after treatment with either a single reagent ( Figs 2 and 3 ) or a combination ( Fig 4 ) . Evaluation of specification was limited to the mesodermal and endodermal lineages as few ectodermal phenotypes emerge in this cul - ture model without specific cytokine supplementation at these time points [ 18 ] . Perturbation of actin polymerization or actin - myosin interactions altered differentiation SEM analysis of solvent matched control samples at Day 7 have a smooth outer surface and few cavitations in the interior ( Fig 2B ) .

Treatment with the antagonist BLEBB also increased the number of cavitations observed . However , the primary effect of treatment with antagonists , which shorten actin filaments ( CYTO D ) or decrease actin - myosin interactions ( BLEBB ) , was in altering the shape of individual cells with rounded cells visible Fig 3 .

Furthermore in the CYTO D treated samples , the change in cell shape in the outermost layer of cells led to a more rippled EB surface . These observed changes in morphology in treated samples are likely due to global changes in cytoskeletal structure within individual cells as the cytoskeleton is a known regulator of cell shape . Some morphological changes may also be due to perturbation of cytoskeletal connections to trans - membrane complexes , altering cell - cell or cell - matrix interactions , as suggested by an altered distribution of E - cadherin positive cells within the EBs ( S2 Fig ) . Mesodermal differentiation was evaluated with gene expression of Meox1 , Pax2 , and Flk1 for the paraxial , intermediate , and lateral mesodermal plates , respectively , in differentiating EBs ( Fig 3A ) . Treatment with JASP or CAL A ( agonists ) had differential effects on each meso - dermal marker : Pax2 was significantly downregulated compared to control samples in both Fig 4 .

Treatment with antagonists for actin polymerization ( CYTO D ) and actin - myosin interactions ( BLEBB ) , however , had a more consistent effect across all markers . With the exception of Meox1 in CYTO D treated samples , expression of all three mesodermal markers was significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) downregulated by > 40 % compared to control samples . Immuno - histochemical analysis for FLK1 protein corroborated the changes in gene expression . Control samples showed distinct areas of positive expression of FLK1 throughout the EBs . The agonists also had extensive positive expression with no notable difference compared to controls . Con - versely , samples treated with the antagonists , and imaged under identical conditions as the other samples , had such low levels of expression that there was no observable immunostaining for FLK1 protein . Endodermal differentiation was evaluated with gene expression of Sox17 , FoxA2 , and Afp ( Fig 3B ) . Treatment with JASP and CAL A agonists resulted in a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) downre - gulation by 40 % - 86 % in all three endodermal markers compared to control samples . In a con - sistent manner , treatment with antagonists resulted in a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 01 ) increase in expression of Sox17 and FoxA2 by approximately 2 - fold , as well as Afp ( 1 . 5 - fold ; BLEBB group only ) . Evaluation of AFP protein after spontaneous differentiation in the control group , as well as treatment with the cytoskeletal agonists , revealed little observable expression . Treatment with the antagonists to actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions , how - ever , promoted extensive expression of AFP protein throughout the EBs . In spontaneously differentiating EBs , the use of cytoskeletal agonists and antagonists for actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions did not maintain pluripotency ( S3 Fig ) but did affect both differentiation and morphology . Modulation of either cytoskeletal process led to similar findings . Inhibition of actin polymerization or actin - myosin interactions decreased differentiation towards the mesodermal phenotype , while promotion of these pro - cesses had little effect . The consistent decrease in mesodermal differentiation due to the CYTO D and BLEBB antagonists indicate that actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions play a role in mesodermal differentiation . The lack of any observed increase in EBs treated with agonists , however , is likely due to the high baseline level of mesodermal differentiation . This is consistent with our own studies [ 11 , 19 ] , as well as those by others [ 18 ] , that have found that without treatment this model of spontaneously differentiating EBs has robust differentia - tion towards the mesodermal phenotype . Protein expression of endodermal AFP remains low in control EBs even after seven days of differentiation . Samples that were treated with the cytoskeletal agonists also had no observable immunostaining for the AFP protein , as well as decreased gene expression of all evaluated endodermal markers . Treatment with the antagonists , however , not only had overall increased endodermal gene expression but also a distinct and marked increase in AFP protein expres - sion . Therefore , modulation of actin polymerization and actin - myosin interactions can be used to both increase and decrease endodermal differentiation in EBs . Given this bidirectional sensitivity , endodermal differentiation may be a sensitive gauge of cytoskeletal perturbation in this culture model . The loss of pluripotency in ESCs is associated with differentiation towards the three germ lineages : endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm . During spontaneous differentiation in EBs , endodermal and mesodermal phenotypes are readily detected [ 18 ] . In the absence of any line - age - specific supplemental cytokines at these time points , however , little to no differentiation is noted towards the ectodermal lineage [ 18 ] . Thus in this system with differentiation primarily to two lineages , it is rationale that the same treatment conditions led to observations at the population level of decreased mesoderm and increased endoderm . It cannot be determined from these studies , however , whether the cytoskeletal processes directly regulate endodermal Modulatingdifferentiation of stem cells PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0195588 April 17 , 2018 8 / 14 differentiation , mesodermal differentiation , or both . Furthermore , modulation of the cytoskel - eton , particularly in the case of the antagonists CYTO D [ 20 ] and BLEBB [ 21 ] , has been previ - ously established to alter cell shape in a variety of cell types [ 22 ] . In the application of a single reagent as above , it was therefore not possible to determine the independent effects of the observed changes in cell shape from changes in cytoskeletal processes . In the subsequent stud - ies a combination of an agonist and antagonist was useful in starting to separate these effects . Differentiation in combinatorial perturbations were similar to antagonist alone In these studies ( Fig 4A ) , treatments were a combination of either CYTO D / CAL A ( to de - crease actin polymerization with an increase in levels of actin - myosin interactions ) or JASP / BLEBB ( to increase actin polymerization with a decrease in actin - myosin interactions ) . While individual treatments of JASP or BLEBB resulted in large cavitations ( Fig 2B ) , the reagents in combination created cavities of a smaller size . CAL A treatment alone ( the agonist of actin - myosin interactions ) also induced small cavities ( Fig 2B ) , which persisted even in the presence of the CYTO D ( Fig 4B ) , the antagonist to actin polymerization . While rounded cells were per - vasive in samples treated with either antagonist alone , few were visible in these samples treated with a combination of an antagonist with an agonist . The limited cell rounding or smaller cavi - tation size could be due to a counterbalancing effect of the agonist and antagonists actin on the actin - myosin network . Differentiation patterns for the combination treatments mimicked those of the antagonist reagent alone . CYTO D / CAL A and JASP / BLEBB treatment groups resulted in a significant ( p < 0 . 01 ) downregulation of the mesodermal markers Pax2 ( by ~ 75 % for both ) and Flk1 ( by 42 or 61 % , respectively ) , as well as Meox1 ( by 45 % ) in the JASP / BLEBB group ( Fig 4C ) . Immu - nostaining of samples from both combination treatment groups also showed markedly lower levels of FLK1 protein compared to control samples . As seen with mesodermal differentiation , the endodermal effect of the combination treatments were similar to the effect of the antago - nist alone . CYTO D / CAL A and JASP / BLEBB treated samples had a similar significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) increase in Sox17 ( by ~ 3 . 5 - fold ) and FoxA2 ( by ~ 2 . 5 - fold ) , as well an increase in Afp for the JASP / BLEBB group ( by 1 . 7 - fold , p < 0 . 01 ) . Protein expression of AFP was extremely low in EBs of control samples . In the experimental groups , however , the combination treatments led to higher expression , where CYTO D / CAL A samples had an intense speckled pattern while the JASP / BLEBB EBs had a more consistent expression throughout the EBs . Changes in cytoskeletal processes , particularly those related to actin polymerization [ 20 ] and actin - myosin interactions [ 21 ] , have been shown to induce changes in the shapes of cells . Photolithography studies to control cell shape have also been shown to regulate differentiation [ 23 , 24 ] , but changes in cytoskeletal state were also involved [ 25 ] . Similar studies that controlled for both cell shape and cytoskeletal processes directly also showed that actin - myosin interac - tions play a role in adult stem cell differentiation [ 1 ] . Also in the first studies presented here , the samples that were treated with single antagonists had individual cells with a more rounded morphology . In both those findings , therefore , it could not be determined if the effects on differentiation were due to the direct modulation of the cytoskeletal processes or its down - stream effects on morphology . In our samples treated with a combination of an agonist and antagonists , however , there were no noticeable changes in cell morphology yet the effects on differentiation were similar to the antagonist only groups . While it is not known if the same mechanisms regulate differentiation for the different treatment groups , in the case of the com - bined treatments the effects of the cytoskeletal processes on differentiation seem to be inde - pendent of morphological changes . Modulatingdifferentiation of stem cells PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0195588 April 17 , 2018 9 / 14 Actin polymerized as filaments serve as the substrate for the actin - myosin motors [ 26 ] , which in turn can remodel filament organization [ 27 ] . This mechanical interplay thus inextri - cably interweaves the biological implications of these processes . Our results here were consis - tent with this notion of interdependence in that modulation of either actin polymerization or actin - myosin interactions had similar effects . We found that , in terms of these cytoskeletal pro - cesses , a sufficient level of each was necessary for mesodermal differentiation and a decrease in either promoted endodermal differentiation . Further studies that explore changes in the ratios of the agonists and antagonists would elucidate any compensatory mechanisms that exist between these two cytoskeletal processes . The studies performed here , however , do identify a role of the cytoskeleton in mesendodermal specification , which is required for differentiation towards metabolically active phenotypes , such as hepatocytes and islet cells , as well as mechan - oresponsive phenotypes , such as cardiomyocytes , endothelial cells , and osteocytes . Applied forces and the cytoskeleton Elements of the physical microenvironment have long been known to affect stem cell fate ( as has been reviewed many times [ 28 , 29 ] ) . It has been shown that externally applied forces ( e . g . tension , compression , and shear ) regulate cell fate ( e . g . viability , proliferation , and differentia - tion ) in both pluripotent [ 13 , 30 , 31 , 32 ] and adult stem cells [ 4 , 33 , 34 ] . Furthermore , the stiffness of the underlying substrate has also been shown to influence stem cell differentiation [ 35 ] . These forces in the external microenvironment are counterbalanced , through direct connec - tions at transmembrane proteins , by the cytoskeleton within the cell [ 36 ] . In response to exter - nal forces , actin , tubulin , and intermediate filaments can act both as load bearing structures that distribute and transmit forces throughout the cell [ 37 , 38 , 39 ] as well as participate in force - generating intracellular molecular motors [ 40 ] . In our own studies , we see a congruency between the effects of applied external forces and perturbations of the cytoskeleton . We have previously shown that ESC differentiation to meso - dermal phenotypes is upregulated when exposed to applied fluid shear stress [ 13 , 32 ] . Cell mechanics studies by others have shown that this type of increased external force can load and reorganize the intermediate filament vimentin [ 41 ] , as well as actin stress fibers [ 42 ] . In a con - sistent manner , our more recent studies have shown that disruptions in the internal cytoskele - tal structure lead to a decrease in mesodermal differentiation . We previously showed that vimentin knockout ESCs have decreased mesodermal differentiation in embryoid bodies com - pared to wild type cells [ 19 ] . Then here we saw that an inhibition of actin polymerization or actin - myosin interactions led to a decrease in mesodermal differentiation . While it is not clear the potential role of parallel or downstream biochemical signaling in these scenarios , together the findings of our studies indicate that mesodermal differentiation is positively correlated with changes in cytoskeletal tension , modulated either as an increase through applied forces or a decrease through intracellular modulation . The mesodermal lineage includes many mechanoresponsive phenotypes , including endo - thelial cells , osteocytes , and chondrocytes . These mature phenotypes must appropriately sense and respond to mechanical loading for proper functionality to maintain tissue homeostasis [ 43 ] . In the case of osteocytes , there is already some indication that the shear - stress mediated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards this phenotype is modulated by the cyto - skeleton [ 44 ] . Conversely , there are indications that the absence of cytoskeletal loading may favor differentiation towards non - mechanoresponsive phenotypes , such as adipocytes [ 1 ] . It is consistent with this growing understanding of the role of mechanics in differentiation that changes in external forces or cytoskeletal loading during early differentiation would affect cell fate . Therefore , systematic approaches to developing step - wise protocols for directed Modulatingdifferentiation of stem cells PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0195588 April 17 , 2018 10 / 14 differentiation of stem cells must address the physical microenvironment during early differ - entiation . Future studies using defined medium and specific growth factors to direct differenti - ation towards targeted linages will help to elucidate the role of these mechanisms along specific paths of differentiation . These studies have shown that modulation of actin filaments and the actin - myosin motor affects germ lineage specification of pluripotent stem cells , increasing our overall understand - ing of differentiation pathways . Specifically , we have identified two cytoskeletal processes that can be effectively targeted for directing differentiation towards select phenotypes in vitro for potential subsequent implantation in vivo . Overall , these findings can help develop and opti - mize protocols for generating cell populations for tissue engineering and regenerative medi - cine therapies . Supporting information S1 Fig .
