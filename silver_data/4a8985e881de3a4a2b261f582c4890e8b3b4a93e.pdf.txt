This context is a profound source of knowledge connected to my " raced " body . I theorize from a place of lived embodied experience , a site of exposure . In philosophy , the only thing we learn to " expose " ( and to do so brutally ) is a weak argument , a fallacy , or someone ' s " inferior " reasoning power . The embodied self is bracketed and deemed irrele vant to theory , superfluous and cumbersome in one ' s search for truth . It is best , or so we are told , to reason from nowhere . The white male philosopher / author presumes to speak for all of " us " without the slightest mention of his raced ( or gendered ) identity . Self - consciously writing as a . white male philosopher , Crispin Sartwell observes : Left to my own devices , I disappear as an author . That is the " whiteness " of . my authorship . This whiteness of authorship is , for us , a form of authority ; to speak ( apparently ) from nowhere , for everyone , is empowering , though one wields power here only by becoming lost to oneself . But such an authorship and authority is also pleasurable : it yields the pleasure of self - forgetting or apparent transcendence of the mundane and the particular , and the . pleasure of power expressed in the ~ ~ comprehension " ofa range ofmaterials . 1 To theorize the Black body one must " turn to the [ Black ] body as the radix for interpreting racial experience . , , 2 This particular strategy also functions as a lens through which to theorize and critique whiteness ; for the Black body ' s " racial " experience is fundamentally linked to the oppressive modalities of the raced white body . However , there is no denying that my own racial experiences or the social performances of w ~ iteness can become objects of critical reflection .

However , there is no denying that my own racial experiences or the social performances of w ~ iteness can become objects of critical reflection . In 65 66 Chapter 3 this chapter , I describe and theorize a variety of instances in which the Black body is reduced to instantiations of the white imaginary , resulting in what I refer to as " the phenomenological return of the Black body . " These instantiations are embedded within and evolve out of the complex social and historical interstices of whites ' efforts at self - construction through complex acts of erasure and deni gration of Black people . These acts of self - construction are myths or ideological constructions predicated upon maintaining white power . As James Snead ex plained , ' ' Mythification is the replacement of history with a surrogate ideology of [ white ] elevation or [ Black ] demotion along a scale of human value . , , 3 I do not hold the view that Blacks only offer experiences while whites pro vide the necessary theoretical framing of those experiences . Consistent with my own theorizations on the subject , Lewis Gordon recognizes the historical impe tus of this move toward experience and how such a move as such is not problematic . " After all , " as Gordon argues , " for a long time there was the denial of black inner life , of black subjectivity ; the notion of a black person ' s point of view suggested consciousness of the world , which would call for dynamics of reciprocal recognition . " 4 Of course , the objectives are 1 ) to avoid reducing Blacks to experience and 2 ) to avoid making whites the oracle intetpretative voices of Black experiences . By implication , it is important to avoid a relationship of dependency and to assert an agential Black exegetical role in rendering their experiences meaningful . OssieDavis To have one ' s dark body penetrated by the white gaze and then to have that body returned as distorted is a powerfully violating experience . The experience presupposes an anti - Black lived context , a context within which the lived experi ence of the Black unfolds . Late writer , actor , and activist Ossie Davis recalled that at age six or seven two white police officers told him to get ' into their car and took him down to the precinct . They kept him there for an hour , laughing at him and eventually pouring cane syrup over his head . This humiliation only created the opportunity for more laughter , as they looke4 upon the " silly " little Black boy . If he was able to articulate his feelings at thiit moment , think of how the young Davis was returned to himself : " I am ' an object of white laughter , a buffoon , a clown , a nigger . " Davis no doubt appeared to the white police offic ers in ways they had approved . They set the stage , created a site of Black buf foonery , and enjoyed their sadistic pleasure without blinking an eye . As Sartwell explains , " The [ white ] oppressor seeks to constrain the oppressed [ Blacks ] to certain approved modes of visibility ( those set out in the template of stereotype ) and then gazes obsessively on the spectacle he has created . " s Davis noted that he " went along with the game of black emasculation , it seemed to come naturally " ; after that , ' ' the ritual was complete " and he was then sent home with $ ome peanut brittle to eat . 6 Even at that early age and Without the words to articulate what he felt , Davis knew he was an innocent victim of vicious white supremacy . 1 i I 1 , 66 Chapter 3 this chapter , I describe and theorize a variety of instances in which the Black body is reduced to instantiations of the white imaginary , resulting in what I refer to as " the phenomenological return of the Black body .

Against the backdrop of the sketched historico - racial ( racist ) scheme , Fanon ' s " darkness " returned to him , signifying a new genus , a new category of man : A Negro ! 32 He inhabited a space of anonymity ( he is every Negro ) , and yet he felt a strange personal responsibility for his body . " I was responsible at the same time for my body , for my race , for my ancestors , " Fanon explained . " I subjected myself to an objective examination , 1 discovered my blackness , my ethnic characteristics ; and 1 was battered down by tom - toms , cannibalism , intellectual deficiency , fetishism , racial defects , slave - ships , and above all else , above all : " sho ' good eaten .

Just as the paint ' s quality of pure white needs the black drops , " racialized " whiteness as normative , moral , good , and pure is dependent upon the projection of the Black body as " inferior , " " stained , " and " impure . " Of course , by the time the paint has become pure white , there is no trace of Blackness . This symbolism is characteristic of white America ' s denial that its very existence is inextricably linked to the presence ofBlack people . The large sign rings true , America must be kept pure . The pure whiteness ofthe paint can " cover just about anything . " Hence whiteness " covers " that which is sullen , dirty , evil . It does away with the unclean . As demonstrated in chapter 6 , the tragic character Pecola Breedlove in Toni Morrison ' s The Bluest Eye believes that whiteness can " cover " over her Black ugly features , permanently washing from her the stain of Blackness . Think here too of how white America " covers " the cultural productions by Black people . To acknowledge Blackness , after all , might lead to the uncovering of whiteness . It might also be said that the power and normative structure of whiteness , through the denial of its own history , " covers " over its acts of injustice and brutality through an ideological structure that gives the appearance ofall things proceeding as normal . Optic White literally can be translated as " eye white " or " seeing white " or figuratively as " I white , " where the verb is deleted . Of course , the term optic raises the issue of the gaze . Optically , the protagonist is rendered invisible . Optically , whites either refuse to see him or see him as if he was the reflected image given back as a result of being " surrounded by mirrors of hard , distorting glass . " s2 As Optic White is " Right White , " the white gaze , as it renders the protagonist invisible / distorted , is exempt from critique because white is always right . Moreover , since optics is the science that deals with the propagation of light , which Europeans historically brought to so - called backward cultures of " darkness , " Optic White is " Right White . " Consistent with this symbolism , Africa became " dark " as " explorers , missionaries , and scientists flooded it with light , because the light was refracted through an imperialist ideology that urged the abolition of ' savage customs ' in the name ofcivilization . " s3 Malcolm X Felt invisibility is a form of ontological and epistemic violence , a form of violence initiated through white spectatorship , a generative gazing that attempts 10 violate the integrity of the Black body . The white gaze is capable of seeping into my consciousness , skewing the way I see myself . But the gaze does not " see " me , it " sees " itself . This experience is similar to what happened early in Malcolm X ' s life with his English teacher , Mr . Ostrowski .

Think here too of how white America " covers " the cultural productions by Black people . To acknowledge Blackness , after all , might lead to the uncovering of whiteness . It might also be said that the power and normative structure of whiteness , through the denial of its own history , " covers " over its acts of injustice and brutality through an ideological structure that gives the appearance ofall things proceeding as normal . Optic White literally can be translated as " eye white " or " seeing white " or figuratively as " I white , " where the verb is deleted . Of course , the term optic raises the issue of the gaze . Optically , the protagonist is rendered invisible . Optically , whites either refuse to see him or see him as if he was the reflected image given back as a result of being " surrounded by mirrors of hard , distorting glass . " s2 As Optic White is " Right White , " the white gaze , as it renders the protagonist invisible / distorted , is exempt from critique because white is always right . Moreover , since optics is the science that deals with the propagation of light , which Europeans historically brought to so - called backward cultures of " darkness , " Optic White is " Right White . " Consistent with this symbolism , Africa became " dark " as " explorers , missionaries , and scientists flooded it with light , because the light was refracted through an imperialist ideology that urged the abolition of ' savage customs ' in the name ofcivilization . " s3 Malcolm X Felt invisibility is a form of ontological and epistemic violence , a form of violence initiated through white spectatorship , a generative gazing that attempts 10 violate the integrity of the Black body . The white gaze is capable of seeping into my consciousness , skewing the way I see myself . But the gaze does not " see " me , it " sees " itself . This experience is similar to what happened early in Malcolm X ' s life with his English teacher , Mr . Ostrowski .

Williams ' s racism on young Malcolm , one better understands the dynamic of Black self - hatred . Self - surveillance or getting the Black body to regulate itself in the physical absence of the white gaze is a significant strategy of white racist ideology . Malcolm had internalized the white gaze . Through the act of conking his hair , he policed his Black body in the image of whiteness : This was my first really big step toward self - degradation : when I endured all of that pain , literally burning my flesh to have it look like a white man ' s hair . I had joined that multitude of Negro men and women in America who are brainwashed into believing that the black people are " inferior " - and white people " superior " - that they will even violate and mutilate their God - created bodies to try to look " pretty " by white standards . 97 The powerful appeal the Nation of Islam had for Malcolm as he got older is not difficult to comprehend . Given the murder of Malcolm ' s father , Earl Little , who was believed to have been killed by white racists because of his affiliation with Marcus Garvey ' s Universal Negro Improvement Association ; given that the Ku Klux Klan had surrounded Malcolm ' s house and threatened his family while his mother , Louise , was pregnant with him ; given that the white state social service system had broken his family apart ; and given that his mother was declared insane by white doctors , the Nation of Islam ' s narrative of Yacub ' s history would certainly have helped Malcolm make sense of white America . According to this narrative , a Black mad scientist named Yacub rebelled against Allah and created , along with 59 , 999 ofhis followers , evil white people . 98 w . E . B . Du Bois In his seminal work , The Souls ofBlack Folk ( 1903 ) , W . E . B . Du Bois , on my reading , also located the problem of white racism within the realm of the socio genic . As I will show , ' Du Bois ' s conceptualization of double consciousness attests to the significance of the lived experience of race . Du Bois ' s work provides a revealingly profound example of how " Blackness " gets negatively configured within a ( white ) gestural , semiotic space . In the following example , there is a phenomenological moment of slippage resulting from the white gaze / glance , between how he may· have understood himself and how he suddenly experienced himself as different from the other ( white ) children . " In a wee wooden schoolhouse , " DuBois wrote , " something put it into the boys ' and girls ' heads to buy gorgeous visiting cards , - ten cents a package - and exchange .

The Return ofthe Black Body 83 When I ' ve taught this part of Ou Bois ' s work , I have had many white students immediately jump to the conclusion that Ou Bois was mistaken , that he was just a child . Indeed , they typically argue that the newcomer ' s refusal is Kimply an example of the way in which children react to each other , how little girls generally treat little boys . However , the tall newcomer did not apparently negatively react to any of the other ( white ) boys . This refusal was ·not about Ou Bois ' s gender . Even if we grant that as a newcomer she felt uncomfortable oround the new students , she apparently only expressed this toward Ou Bois . Hence it is obvious that there is a fundamental link between racial reification of the young Ou Bois and the girl ' s callous rejection . As for my students , one could argue that they failed to show empathy toward Ou Bois because of the more general ways in which contemporary American society has become profoundly atomized , where social actors ' imaginative capacities have become dulled . While this explanation may very well help account for why my students rarely lee any problem with the newcomer ' s response to Ou Bois , perhaps there is something that they also refuse to face or are afraid to face . I am thinking here of what one white male student of mine , Andrew Thomas , pointed out . After hearing so many responses that aimed to reinterpret Ou Bois ' s experience for him , Thomas introduced a very significant point : " I think that many whites might feel the need to reject what Ou Bois is saying because they are perhaps reminded of situations where they ' ve treated a Black person in the way that the newcomer treated Ou Bois . The Ou Bois example reminds them of something that they don ' t want to see in themselves . They don ' t want to admit that they too harbor such racism . " Du Bois ' s example suggests that he was in some sense similar to the other ( white ) children . In " heart , " " life , " and " longing " he appears to have felt a kin dred relationship . Indeed , the pain and trauma of rejection was probably all the more intense because he thought that he shared certain similarities . But some thing went awry . There was a sudden annoying feeling of difference , which presumably did not exist prior to this encounter . Hence Ou Bois underwent a distinctive phenomenological process of coming to appear to himself differently 6S one who is expelled . He moved from a sense of the familiar to the unfamiliar . A slippage occurred in his corporeal schema . In this example , Ou Bois ' s body Mehema has become problematic . He is forced to deal with the meaning of a rncial epidermal schema as a result of ( or introduced by ) the . meaning constituting activities of the young girl ' s racialized consciousness . As with I ; anon , Ellison ' s invisible man , and Malcolm X , Ou Bois was " taken outside " of himself and returned . Surely , Ou Bois is the same self he was prior to the jcstured glance the tall white girl performed . Surely , he was classified " Black " prior to his encounter that day with the tall newcomer , though he may not have C ' xperienced this classificatory designation as something problematic or as a lIlark of disdain . But is he the same ? As the tall white girl refused him , she sent 11 semiotic message , a message whose constructive meaning was immediately registered in the consciousness of the young Ou Bois . Her body language , her refusal , involved a ritual that had tremendous power .

Her body language , her refusal , involved a ritual that had tremendous power . The ritual glance / refusal 84 Chapter 3 took place within a pre - interpreted space of racial meaning . This precondition formed the basis upon which the glance ' s meaning registered for Du Bois that something had become problematic at the level of his epidermis . In order for Du Bois to have understood the specific racial meaning of the glance he had to have a certain level of racial narrative competence . In short , part of his horizon involved an awareness of difference , but also an awareness of difference in an exclusionary sense . The ritual glance is both a product ofthis space and a vehicle through which racial and racist performances are perpetuated . Du Bois wrote that the tall white girl " refused it peremptorily , with a glance . " This refusal involves the arrogance and self - centeredness of whiteness , a form of white narcissism articulated through a look . The performance of whiteness , then , is not restricted to a set of articulated propositional beliefs or in the deployment of various rhetorical strategies . White racism can be expressed through the modality ofphysical com portment , a way of inhabiting physical space , a way of glancing / not glancing . " Seen " through the eyes of the newcomer , Du Bois ' s Black body was already coded as different , as a problem , as that which should be avoided . Though young , the tall white newcomer had already learned complex ways of white coping , ways of seeing the Black body as a site of avoidance , ways of not seeing her body as raced , different . Her whiteness as norm is reinforced through this exclusionary act . Her racial status as white remains paradoxically unmarked and yet marked in this communicational space , though she never spoke . The unspoken power of whiteness reflects the effective transmission of rac ism , not only through words but also through subtle actions . " We learned far more from acts than words , more from a raised eyebrow , a joke , a shocked voice , a withdrawing movement of the body , a long silence , than from long sen tences , " Smith notes . 100 Within the context of this highly racial and racist communicational space , Du Bois ' s body came to matter . He was the material ization of darkness with all its normative and typological associations , " the colored kid , monkeychild , different . , , 101 Indeed , the newcomer ' s ritual glance " produced bodily effects through immediate [ non ] verbal acts that reify racial difference . " lo2 Through her refusal to exchange with Du Bois , he returns to himselfas excluded . The white girl , however , returns to herselfas the center ; her glance policed her whiteness as a privileged ( unspoken ) site . I03 She never says in a declarative voice , " I ' m white ! " Du Bois did not say in the indicative , . " You ' re white ! " Williams writes , in America " whiteness is rarely marked in the indicative there ! there ! sense of my bracketed blackness . And the majoritarian privilege [ of whites ] of never noticing themselves was the beginning of an imbalance from which so much , so much else flowed . " 104 The newcomer ' s whiteness is interpellated , performed , claimed , through a nonverbal gesture of negation . Although young and " innocent , " her actions reflect larger political hallmarks of white racism : the audacity and power to relegate nonwhites to the margins , to segregate them , to instill in them the sense of existing outside the space of white normalcy and normativity . j 84 Chapter 3 took place within a pre - interpreted space of racial meaning .

Hence , he became , if only momentarily , other to himself . Like Fanon , who described the phenomenological dimensions of corporeal malediction , Du Bois underwent a similar process , one that he tenned double consciousness : It is a peculiar sensation , this double - consciousness , this sense of always look ing at one ' s selfthrough the eyes of others , of measuring one ' s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity .

In this process of disjointedness , one ceases to experience one ' s identity from a locus of self - definition and begins to experience one ' s identity from a locus of exter nally imposed meaning .

" The question is raised to the level ofthe ontological : " How does it feel to be a problem ? " As a problem from the perspective of white mythopoetic constructions , Du Bois was aware that it is the " stained " Black body at both the phenotypic and the consanguineous level that is deemed criminal . " Murder may swagger , theft may rule and prostitution may flourish and the nation gives but spasmodic , intermit tent and lukewarm attention , " he noted . " But let the murderer be black or the thief brown or the violator of womanhood have a drop of Negro blood , and the righteousness of the indigtiation sweeps the world . , , 117 The question regarding how it feels to be a problem does not apply to people who have at some point in their lives felt themselves to be a problem . In such cases , feeling like a problem is a contingent disposition that is relatively finite and transitory . When whites ask the same question ofBlacks , the relationship between being Black and being a problem is noncontingent . It is a necessary relation . Outgrowing this ontolog ical state of being a problem is believed impossible . Hence , when regarding one ' s " existence as problematic , " temporality is frozen . One is a problem forever , fixed , permanent . However , it is important to note that it is from within the white imaginary that the question " How does it feel to be a problem ? " is given birth . To be human is to be thrown - in - the - world . To be human not only means to be thrown within a context of facticity , but also to be in the mode of the subjunctive . The etymology of the word problem suggests the sense of being " thrown forward , " as if being thrown in front of something , as an obstacle . Within the white imaginary , to be Black means to be born an obstacle at the very core of one ' s being . To ex - ist as Black is not " to stand out " facing an ontological horizon filled with future possibilities of being other than what one is . Rather , being Black negates the " ex " of existence . Being Black is reduced to facticity . For example , it is not only within the light of my freely chosen projects that things are experienced as obstacles , as Sartre might say ; as Black , by definition , I am an obstacle . As Black , I am the very obstacle to my own metastability and transphenomenal being . As Black , I am not a project at all . Hence , within the framework of the white imaginary , to be Black and to be human are contradictory terms . Du Bois , like Toni Morrison after him , was aware of the strategic signif icance of averting the critical gaze from the racial " object " ( the Black ) to the racial " subject " ( the white ) . In 1920 , in his powerful and engaging essay entitled " The Souls ofWhite Folk , " Du Bois wrote : I see these souls [ of white folk ] undressed and from the back and side . I see the working oftheir entrails . I know their thoughts and they know that I know . This knowledge makes them now embarrassed , now furious ! They deny my right to live and be and call me misbirth ! My word is to them mere bitterness and my soul , pessimism .

With deep psychological insight into the " entrails " of whiteness , Du Bois observed : We have seen , you and I , city after city drunk and furious with ungovernable lust of blood ; mad with murder , destroying , killing , and cursing ; torturing human victims because somebody accused ofcrime happened to be of the same color as the mob ' s innocent victims and because that color was not white !

Although she was not writing about the colonial context , it is difficult to resist referring to Toni Morrison ' s examination of a passage from Ernest Hemingway ' s To Have and To Have Not . The point that she raises speaks to the way in which white women , though historically oppressed by white men , receive an " existential wage , " as it were , in virtue of being white when com pared to Black / nonwhite women . The ideological significance of this example in relationship to Ba ( a ) rtman ( n ) is powerful . In a particular scene in the novel , the character Harry is making love to his wife , Marie , who asks : " Listen , did you ever do it with a nigger wench ? " " Sure . " " What ' s it like ? " " Like nurse shark . " Morrison notes : The strong notion here is that of a black female as the furthest thing from human , so far away as to be not even mammal but fish . The figure evokes a predatory , devouring eroticism and signals the antithesis to femininity , to nurturing , to nursing , to replenishment . In short , Harry ' s words mark something so brutal , contrary , and alien in its figuration that it does not belong to its own species and cannot be spoken of in language , in metaphor or metonmy , evocative of anything resembling the woman to whom Harry is speaking - his wife Marie . The kindness he has done Marie is palpable . His projection of black female sexuality has provided her with solace , for which she is properly grateful . She responds to the kindness and giggles , " You ' re funny . " 165 " Hottentot maidens and Indian squaws are beautiful because of their comparability to Frenchwomen , the embodiment of beauty itself . " I66 Prima facie , it would appear that to refer to Ba ( a ) rtman ( n ) as " Venus " might function as a torm of praise . As Sharpley - Whiting points out , however , the use of the term " Venus " to describe the Black female body simply reinscribed the power of the , w , lmeness ofEuropean superiority . The Roman deity of beauty , Venus , was also revered as the protectress of Roman prostitutes , who in her honor erected Venus temples of worship . Within these temples , instruction in the arts of love was given to aspiring courtesans . It is the latter image ofprostitution , sexuality , and danger that reproduced itselfin narrative and was projected onto black female bodies . The projection of the Venus image , of prostitute proclivities , onto black female bodies , allows the French writer to maintain a position ofmoral , sexual , and racial superiority . 167 To reiterate , the European has created a Manichaean world to buttress his ! her own sense of who he / she is .
