The DBDs have been well characterized , but little is known about the mechanisms by which ADs effect gene activation . Here , we report that diverse ADs form phase - separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator . For the OCT4 and GCN4 TFs , we show that the ability to form phase - separated droplets with Mediator in vitro and the ability to activate genes in vivo are dependent on the same amino acid residues . For the estrogen receptor ( ER ) , a ligand - dependent activator , we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator , again linking phase separation with gene activation . These results suggest that diverse TFs can interact with Mediator through the phase - separating capacity of their ADs and that formation of condensates with Mediator is involved in gene activation . INTRODUCTION Regulation of gene expression requires that the transcription apparatus be efﬁciently assembled at speciﬁc genomic sites . DNA - binding transcription factors ( TFs ) ensure this speciﬁcity by occupying speciﬁc DNA sequences at enhancers and pro - moter - proximal elements . TFs typically consist of one or more DNA - binding domains ( DBDs ) and one or more separate activa - tion domains ( ADs ) ( Brent and Ptashne , 1985 ; Keegan et al . , 1986 ) . While the structure and function of TF DBDs are well documented , comparatively little is understood about the struc - ture of ADs and how these interact with coactivators to drive gene expression . The structure of TF DBDs and their interaction with cognate DNA sequences has been described at atomic resolution for many TFs , and TFs are generally classiﬁed according to the structural features of their DBDs ( Fulton et al . , 2009 ; Vaquerizas et al . , 2009 ) . For example , DBDs can be composed of zinc - coordinating , basic helix - loop - helix , basic - leucine zipper , or helix - turn - helix DNA - binding structures . These DBDs selec - tively bind speciﬁc DNA sequences that range from 4 to 12 bp , and the DNA binding sequences favored by hundreds of TFs have been described ( Hume et al . , 2015 ; Jolma et al . , 2013 ; Khan et al . , 2018 ) . Multiple TF molecules typically bind together at any one enhancer or promoter - proximal element . For example , at least eight different TF molecules bind a 50 - bp core component of the interferon ( IFN ) - b enhancer ( Panne et al . , 2007 ) . Anchored in place by the DBD , the AD interacts with coactiva - tors , which integrate signals from multiple TFs to regulate tran - scriptional output ( Allen and Taatjes , 2015 ; Juven - Gershon and Kadonaga , 2010 ; Malik and Roeder , 2010 ; Plaschka et al . , 2016 ; Reiter et al . , 2017 ; Soutourina , 2018 ; Taatjes , 2010 ) . In contrast to the structured DBD , the ADs of most TFs are low - complexity amino acid sequences not amenable to crystallog - raphy . These intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) have there - fore been classiﬁed by their amino acid proﬁle as acidic , proline , serine / threonine , or glutamine rich or by their hypothetical shape as acid blobs , negative noodles , or peptide lassos ( Mitchell and Tjian , 1989 ; Roberts , 2000 ; Sigler , 1988 ; Staby et al . , 2017 ; Triezenberg , 1995 ) . Remarkably , hundreds of TFs are thought to interact with the same small set of coactivator com - plexes , which include Mediator and p300 ( Allen and Taatjes , 2015 ; Avantaggiati et al . , 1996 ; Dai and Markham , 2001 ; Eckner et al . , 1996 ; Green , 2005 ; Merika et al . , 1998 ; Oliner et al . , 1996 ; Yin and Wang , 2014 ; Yuan et al . , 1996 ) . ADs that share little 1842 Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 , December 13 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Inc . sequence homology are functionally interchangeable among TFs ( Godowski et al . , 1988 ; Hope and Struhl , 1986 ; Jin et al . , 2016 ; Lech et al . , 1988 ; Ransone et al . , 1990 ; Sadowski et al . , 1988 ; Struhl , 1988 ; Tora et al . , 1989 ) ; this interchangeability is not readily explained by traditional lock - and - key models of pro - tein - protein interaction . Thus , how the diverse ADs of hundreds of different TFs interact with a similar small set of coactivators remains a conundrum . Recent studies have shown that the AD of the yeast TF GCN4 binds to the Mediator subunit MED15 at multiple sites and in mul - tiple orientations and conformations ( Brzovic et al . , 2011 ; Jedidi et al . , 2010 ; Tuttle et al . , 2018 ; Warﬁeld et al . , 2014 ) . The prod - ucts of this type of protein - protein interaction , where the interac - tion interface cannot be described by a single conformation , have been termed ‘‘fuzzy complexes’’ ( Tompa and Fuxreiter , 2008 ) . These dynamic interactions are also typical of the IDR - IDR interactions that facilitate formation of phase - separated biomolecular condensates ( Alberti , 2017 ; Banani et al . , 2017 ; Hyman et al . , 2014 ; Shin and Brangwynne , 2017 ; Wheeler and Hyman , 2018 ) . We recently proposed that transcriptional control may be driven by the formation of phase - separated condensates ( Hnisz et al . , 2017 ) and demonstrated that the coactivator proteins MED1 and BRD4 form phase - separated condensates at su - per - enhancers ( SEs ) ( Sabari et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we report that diverse TF ADs phase separate with the Mediator coactivator . We show that the embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) pluripotency TF OCT4 , the estrogen receptor ( ER ) , and the yeast TF GCN4 form phase - separated condensates with Mediator and require the same amino acids or ligands for both activation and phase separation . We propose that IDR - mediated phase sepa - ration with coactivators is a mechanism by which TF ADs acti - vate genes . RESULTS Mediator Condensates at ESC SEs Depend on OCT4 OCT4 is a master TF essential for the pluripotent state of ESCs and is a deﬁning TF at ESC SEs ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . The Medi - ator coactivator , which forms condensates at ESC SEs ( Sabari et al . , 2018 ) , is thought to interact with OCT4 via the MED1 sub - unit ( Table S1 ) ( Apostolou et al . , 2013 ) . If OCT4 contributes to the formation of Mediator condensates , then OCT4 puncta should be present at the SEs where MED1 puncta have been observed . Indeed , immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) microscopy with concurrent nascent RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) revealed discrete OCT4 puncta at the SEs of the key pluripotency genes Esrrb , Nanog , Trim28 , and Mir290 ( Figure 1 ) . Average image analysis conﬁrmed that OCT4 IF was enriched at center of RNA FISH foci . This enrichment was not seen using a randomly selected nuclear position ( Figure S1 ) . These results conﬁrm that OCT4 occurs in puncta at the same SEs where Mediator forms condensates ( Sabari et al . , 2018 ) and where chromatin immuno - precipitation sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) shows co - occupancy of OCT4 and MED1 ( Figure 1 ) . We investigated whether the Mediator condensates present at SEs are dependent on OCT4 using a degradation strategy ( Nabet et al . , 2018 ) . Degradation of OCT4 in an ESC line bearing endogenous knockin of DNA encoding the FKBP protein fused to OCT4 was induced by addition of dTag for 24 hr ( Weintraub et al . , 2017 ) ( Figures 2A and S2A ) . Induction of OCT4 degrada - tion reduced OCT4 protein levels but did not affect MED1 levels ( Figure S2B ) . ChIP - seq analysis showed a reduction of OCT4 and MED1 occupancy at enhancers , with the most profound effects occurring at SEs , as compared to typical enhancers ( TEs ) ( Figure 2B ) . RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) revealed that expression of SE - driven genes was concomitantly decreased ( Figure 2B ) . For example , OCT4 and MED1 occupancy was reduced by approximately 90 % at the Nanog SE ( Figure 2C ) , associated with a 60 % reduction in Nanog mRNA levels ( Figure 2D ) . IF microscopy with concurrent DNA FISH showed that OCT4 degradation caused a reduction in MED1 conden - sates at Nanog ( Figures 2E and S2C ) . These results indicate that the presence of Mediator condensates at an ESC SE is dependent on OCT4 . ESC differentiation causes a loss of OCT4 binding at certain ESC SEs , which leads to a loss of these OCT4 - dependent SEs , and thus should cause a loss of Mediator condensates at these sites . To test this idea , we differentiated ESCs by leukemia inhib - itory factor ( LIF ) withdrawal . In the differentiated cell population , we observed reduced OCT4 and MED1 occupancy at the Mir290 SE ( Figures 2F , 2G , and S2D ) and reduced levels of Mir290 miRNA ( Figure 2H ) , despite continued expression of MED1 pro - tein ( Figure S2E ) . Correspondingly , MED1 condensates were reduced at Mir290 ( Figures 2I and S2F ) in the differentiated cell population . These results are consistent with those obtained with the OCT4 degron experiment and support the idea that Mediator condensates at these ESC SEs are dependent on oc - cupancy of the enhancer elements by OCT4 . OCT4 Is Incorporated into MED1 Liquid Droplets OCT4 has two intrinsically disordered ADs responsible for gene activation , which ﬂank a structured DBD ( Figure 3A ) ( Brehm et al . , 1997 ) . Since IDRs are capable of forming dynamic net - works of weak interactions , and the puriﬁed IDRs of proteins involved in condensate formation can form phase - separated droplets ( Burke et al . , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2015 ; Nott et al . , 2015 ) , we next investigated whether OCT4 is capable of forming droplets in vitro , with and without the IDR of the MED1 subunit of Mediator . Recombinant OCT4 - GFP fusion protein was puriﬁed and added to droplet formation buffers containing a crowding agent ( 10 % PEG - 8000 ) to simulate the densely crowded environment of the nucleus . Fluorescent microscopy of the droplet mixture revealed that OCT4 alone did not form droplets throughout the range of concentrations tested ( Figure 3B ) . In contrast , puriﬁed recombinant MED1 - IDR - GFP fusion protein exhibited concen - tration - dependent liquid - liquid phase separation ( Figure 3B ) , as described previously ( Sabari et al . , 2018 ) . We then mixed the two proteins and found that droplets of MED1 - IDR incorporate and concentrate puriﬁed OCT4 - GFP to form heterotypic droplets ( Figure 3C ) . In contrast , puriﬁed GFP was not concentrated into MED1 - IDR droplets ( Figures 3C and S3A ) . OCT4 - MED1 - IDR droplets were near micrometer sized ( Figure S3B ) , exhibited fast recovery after photobleaching ( Figure 3D ) , had a spherical shape ( Figure S3C ) , and were salt Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 , December 13 , 2018 1843 sensitive ( Figures 3E and S3D ) . Thus , they exhibited characteris - tics associated with phase - separated liquid condensates ( Ba - nani et al . , 2017 ; Shin and Brangwynne , 2017 ) . Furthermore , we found that OCT4 - MED1 - IDR droplets could form in the absence of any crowding agent ( Figures S3E and S3F ) . Residues Required for OCT4 - MED1 - IDR Droplet Formation and Gene Activation We next investigated whether speciﬁc OCT4 amino acid resi - dues are required for the formation of OCT4 - MED1 - IDR phase - separated droplets , as multiple categories of amino acid interac - tion have been implicated in forming condensates . For example , serine residues are required for MED1 phase separation ( Sabari et al . , 2018 ) . We asked whether amino acid enrichments in the OCT4 ADs might point to a mechanism for interaction . An anal - ysis of amino acid frequency and charge bias showed that the OCT4 IDRs are enriched in proline and glycine and have an over - all acidic charge ( Figure 4A ) . ADs are known to be enriched in acidic amino acids and proline and have historically been classi - ﬁed on this basis ( Frietze and Farnham , 2011 ) , but the mecha - nism by which these enrichments might cause gene activation is not known . We hypothesized that proline or acidic amino acids in the ADs might facilitate interaction with the phase - separated MED1 - IDR droplet . To test this , we designed ﬂuorescently labeled proline and glutamic acid decapeptides and investigated whether these peptides can be concentrated in MED1 - IDR droplets . When added to droplet formation buffer alone , these peptides remained in solution ( Figure S4A ) . When mixed with MED1 - IDR - GFP , however , proline peptides were not incorpo - rated into MED1 - IDR droplets , while the glutamic acid peptides were concentrated within ( Figures 4B and S4B ) . These results show that peptides with acidic residues are amenable to incor - poration within MED1 phase - separated droplets . Based on these results , we deduced that an OCT4 protein lacking acidic amino acids in its ADs might be defective in its ability to phase separate with MED1 - IDR . Such a dependence on acidic residues would be consistent with our observation that OCT4 - MED1 - IDR droplets are highly salt sensitive . To test this idea , we generated a mutant OCT4 in which all acidic resi - dues in the ADs were replaced with alanine ( thus changing 17 AAs in the N - terminal AD and 6 in the C - terminal AD ) ( Figure 4C ) . When this GFP - fused OCT4 mutant was mixed with puriﬁed Figure 1 .

To test whether this effect was speciﬁc for acidic res - idues , we generated a mutant of OCT4 in which all the aromatic amino acids within the ADs were changed to alanine . We found that this mutant was still incorporated into MED1 - IDR droplets ( Figures S4C and S4D ) . These results indicate that the ability of OCT4 to phase separate with MED1 - IDR is dependent on acidic residues in the OCT4 IDRs . To ensure that these results were not speciﬁc to the MED1 - IDR , we explored whether puriﬁed Mediator complexes would form droplets in vitro and incorporate OCT4 . The human Medi - ator complex was puriﬁed as previously described ( Meyer et al . , 2008 ) and then concentrated for use in the droplet forma - tion assay ( Figure S4E ) . Because puriﬁed endogenous Mediator does not contain a ﬂuorescent tag , we monitored droplet forma - tion by differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy and found it to form droplets alone at (cid:1) 200 – 400 nM ( Figure 4D ) . Consistent with the results for MED1 - IDR droplets , OCT4 was incorporated within human Mediator complex droplets , but incorporation of the OCT4 acidic mutant was attenuated . These results indicate that the MED1 - IDR and the complete Mediator complex each exhibit phase - separating behaviors and suggest that they both incorporate OCT4 in a manner that is dependent on electrostatic interactions provided by acidic amino acids . To test whether the OCT4 AD acidic mutations affect the abil - ity of the factor to activate transcription in vivo , we utilized a GAL4 transactivation assay ( Figure 4E ) . In this system , ADs or their mutant counterparts are fused to the GAL4 DBD and ex - pressed in cells carrying a luciferase reporter plasmid . We found that the wild - type OCT4 - AD fused to the GAL4 - DBD was able to activate transcription , while the acidic mutant lost this function ( Figure 4E ) . These results indicate that the acidic residues of the OCT4 ADs are necessary for both incorporation into MED1 phase - separated droplets in vitro and for gene acti - vation in vivo . Multiple TFs Phase Separate with Mediator Subunit Droplets TFs with diverse types of ADs have been shown to interact with Mediator subunits , and MED1 is among the subunits that is most targeted by TFs ( Table S1 ) . An analysis of mammalian TFs conﬁrmed that TFs and their putative ADs are enriched in IDRs , as previous analyses have shown ( Liu et al . , 2006 ; Staby et al . , 2017 ) ( Figure 5A ) . We reasoned that many different TFs might interact with the MED1 - IDR to generate liquid droplets and therefore be incorporated into MED1 condensates . To assess whether diverse MED1 - interacting TFs can phase sepa - rate with MED1 , we prepared puriﬁed recombinant , mEGFP - tagged , full - length MYC , p53 , NANOG , SOX2 , RARa , GATA2 , and ER ( Table S3 ) . When added to droplet formation buffers , most TFs formed droplets alone ( Figure 5B ) . When added to droplet formation buffers with MED1 - IDR , all 7 of these TFs concentrated into MED1 - IDR droplets ( Figures 5C and S5A ) . We selected p53 droplets for ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis ; they exhibited rapid and dy - namic internal reorganization ( Figure S5B ) , supporting the notion that they are liquid condensates . These results indicate that TFs previously shown to interact with the MED1 subunit of Mediator can do so by forming phase - separated condensates with MED1 . Estrogen Stimulates Phase Separation of ER with MED1 ER is a well - studied example of a ligand - dependent TF . ER con - sists of an N - terminal ligand - independent AD , a central DBD , and a C - terminal ligand - dependent AD ( also called the ligand binding domain [ LBD ] ) ( Figure 6A ) . Estrogen facilitates the inter - action of ER with MED1 by binding the LBD of ER , which ex - poses a binding pocket for LXXLL motifs within the MED1 - IDR ( Figures 6A and 6B ) ( Manavathi et al . , 2014 ) . We noted that ER can form heterotypic droplets with the MED1 - IDR recombinant protein used thus far in these studies ( Figure 5C ) , which lacks the LXXLL motifs . This led us to investigate whether ER - MED1 droplet formation is responsive to estrogen and whether this involves the MED1 LXXLL motifs . We performed droplet formation assays using a MED1 - IDR recombinant protein containing LXXLL motifs ( MED1 - IDRXL - mCherry ) and found that , similar to MED1 - IDR and complete Mediator , it had the ability to form droplets alone ( Figure 6C ) . We then tested the ability of ER to phase separate with MED1 - IDRXL - mCherry and MED1 - IDR - mCherry droplets . Figure 2 .

In contrast , the addition of estrogen had little effect on droplet formation when the experiment was conducted with MED1 - IDR - mCherry , which lacks the LXXLL motifs ( Figure S6 ) . These results show that estrogen , which stimulates ER - medi - ated transcription in vivo , also stimulates incorporation of ER into MED1 - IDR droplets in vitro . Thus , OCT4 and ER both require the same amino acids / ligands for both phase separation and activation . Furthermore , since the LBD is a structured domain that undergoes a conformation shift upon estrogen binding to interact with MED1 , it appears that structured interactions may contribute to transcriptional condensate formation . GCN4 and MED15 Phase Separation Is Dependent on Residues Required for Activation Among the best - studied TF - coactivator systems is the yeast TF GCN4 and its interaction with the MED15 subunit of Mediator ( Brzovic et al . , 2011 ; Herbig et al . , 2010 ; Jedidi et al . , 2010 ) . The GCN4 AD has been dissected genetically , the amino acids that contribute to activation have been identiﬁed ( Drysdale et al . , 1995 ; Staller et al . , 2018 ) , and recent studies have shown that the GCN4 AD interacts with MED15 in multiple orientations and conformations to form a ‘‘fuzzy complex’’ ( Tuttle et al . , 2018 ) . Weak interactions that form fuzzy complexes have fea - tures of the IDR - IDR interactions that are thought to produce phase - separated condensates . To test whether GCN4 and MED15 can form phase - separated droplets , we puriﬁed recombinant yeast GCN4 - GFP and the N - terminal portion of yeast MED15 - mCherry containing residues 6 – 651 ( hereafter called MED15 ) , which are responsible for the interaction with GCN4 . When added separately to droplet forma - tion buffer , GCN4 formed micrometer - sized droplets only at quite high concentrations ( 40 m M ) , and MED15 formed only small droplets at this high concentration ( Figure 7A ) . When mixed together , however , the GCN4 and MED15 recombinant proteins formed double - positive , micrometer - sized , spherical droplets at lower concentrations ( Figures 7B and S7A ) . These GCN4 - MED15 droplets exhibited rapid FRAP kinetics ( Figure S7B ) , consistent with liquid - like behavior . We generated a phase dia - gram of these two proteins and found that they formed droplets together at low concentration ( Figures S7C and S7D ) . This suggests that interaction between the two is required for phase separation at low concentration . The ability of GCN4 to interact with MED15 and activate gene expression has been attributed to speciﬁc hydrophobic patches Figure 3 .

( legend continued on next page ) 1848 Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 , December 13 , 2018 and aromatic residues in the GCN4 AD ( Drysdale et al . , 1995 ; Staller et al . , 2018 ; Tuttle et al . , 2018 ) . We created a mutant of GCN4 in which the 11 aromatic residues contained in these hy - drophobic patches were changed to alanine ( Figure 7C ) . When added to droplet formation buffers , the ability of the mutant pro - tein to form droplets alone was attenuated ( Figure S7E ) . Next , we tested whether droplet formation with MED15 was affected ; indeed , the mutated protein has a compromised ability to form droplets with MED15 ( Figures 7C and S7F ) . Similar results were obtained when GCN4 and the aromatic mutant of GCN4 was added to droplet formation buffers with the complete Mediator complex ; while GCN4 was incorporated into Mediator droplets , the incorporation of the GCN4 mutant into Mediator droplets was attenuated ( Figures 7D and S7G ) . These results demonstrate that multivalent , weak interactions between the AD of GCN4 and MED15 promote phase separation into liquid - like droplets . The ADs of yeast TFs can function in mammalian cells and can do so by interacting with human Mediator ( Oliviero et al . , 1992 ) . To investigate whether the aromatic mutant of GCN4 AD is impaired in its ability to recruit Mediator in vivo , the GCN4 AD and the GCN4 mutant AD were tethered to a Lac array in U2OS cells ( Figure 7E ) ( Janicki et al . , 2004 ) . While the tethered GCN4 AD caused robust Mediator recruitment , the GCN4 aro - matic mutant did not ( Figure 7E ) . We used the GAL4 transactiva - tion assay described previously to conﬁrm that the GCN4 AD was capable of transcriptional activation in vivo , whereas the GCN4 aromatic mutant had lost that property ( Figure 7F ) . These results provide further support for the idea that TF AD amino acids that are essential for phase separation with Mediator are required for gene activation . DISCUSSION The results described here support a model whereby TFs interact with Mediator and activate genes by the capacity of their ADs to form phase - separated condensates with this coactivator . For both the mammalian ESC pluripotency TF OCT4 and the yeast TF GCN4 , we found that the AD amino acids required for phase separation with Mediator condensates were also required for gene activation in vivo . For ER , we found that estrogen stim - ulates the formation of phase - separated ER - MED1 droplets . ADs and coactivators generally consist of low - complexity amino acid sequences that have been classiﬁed as IDRs , and IDR - IDR interactions have been implicated in facilitating the formation of phase - separated condensates . We propose that IDR - mediated phase separation with Mediator is a general mechanism by which TF ADs effect gene expression and provide evidence that this occurs in vivo at SEs . We suggest that the ability to phase separate with Mediator , which would employ the features of high valency and low - afﬁnity characteristic of liquid - liquid phase - separated condensates , operates alongside an ability of some TFs to form high - afﬁnity interactions with Mediator ( Fig - ure 7G ) ( Taatjes , 2017 ) . The model that TF ADs function by forming phase - separated condensates with coactivators explains several observations that are difﬁcult to reconcile with classical lock - and - key models of protein - protein interaction . The mammalian genome en - codes many hundreds of TFs with diverse ADs that must interact with a small number of coactivators ( Allen and Taatjes , 2015 ; Arany et al . , 1995 ; Avantaggiati et al . , 1996 ; Dai and Markham , 2001 ; Eckner et al . , 1996 ; Gelman et al . , 1999 ; Green , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ; Merika et al . , 1998 ; Oliner et al . , 1996 ; Yin and Wang , 2014 ; Yuan et al . , 1996 ) , and ADs that share little sequence homology are functionally inter - changeable among TFs ( Godowski et al . , 1988 ; Hope and Struhl , 1986 ; Jin et al . , 2016 ; Lech et al . , 1988 ; Ransone et al . , 1990 ; Sadowski et al . , 1988 ; Struhl , 1988 ; Tora et al . , 1989 ) . The common feature of ADs—the possession of low - complexity IDRs—is also a feature that is pronounced in coactivators . The model of coactivator interaction and gene activation by phase - separated condensate formation thus more readily explains how many hundreds of mammalian TFs interact with these coactivators . Previous studies have provided important insights that promp - ted us to investigate the possibility that TF ADs function by form - ing phase - separated condensates . TF ADs have been classiﬁed by their amino acid proﬁle as acidic , proline rich , serine / threonine rich , glutamine rich , or by their hypothetical shape as acid blobs , negative noodles , or peptide lassos ( Sigler , 1988 ) . Many of these features have been described for IDRs that are capable of form - ing phase - separated condensates ( Babu , 2016 ; Darling et al . , 2018 ; Das et al . , 2015 ; Dunker et al . , 2015 ; Habchi et al . , 2014 ; van der Lee et al . , 2014 ; Oldﬁeld and Dunker , 2014 ; Uversky , 2017 ; Wright and Dyson , 2015 ) . Evidence that the GCN4 AD in - teracts with MED15 in multiple orientations and conformations to form a ‘‘fuzzy complex’’ ( Tuttle et al . , 2018 ) is consistent with the notion of dynamic low - afﬁnity interactions characteristic of phase - separated condensates . Likewise , the low complexity domains of the FET ( FUS / EWS / TAF15 ) RNA - binding proteins ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) can form phase - separated hydrogels and interact with the RNA polymerase II C - terminal domain ( CTD ) in a CTD phosphorylation - dependent manner ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) ; this may explain the mechanism by which RNA po - lymerase II is recruited to active genes in its unphosphorylated state and released for elongation following phosphorylation of the CTD . The model we describe here for TF AD function may explain the function of a class of heretofore poorly understood fusion oncoproteins . Many malignancies bear fusion - protein translo - cations involving portions of TFs ( Bradner et al . , 2017 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ; Latysheva et al . , 2016 ) .

See also Figure S4 and Table S3 . Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 , December 13 , 2018 1849 products often fuse a DNA - or chromatin - binding domain to a wide array of partners , many of which are IDRs . For example , MLL may be fused to 80 different partner genes in AML ( Win - ters and Bernt , 2017 ) , the EWS - FLI rearrangement in Ewing’s sarcoma causes malignant transformation by recruitment of a disordered domain to oncogenes ( Boulay et al . , 2017 ; Chong et al . , 2017 ) , and the disordered phase - separating protein FUS is found fused to a DBD in certain sarcomas ( Crozat et al . , 1993 ; Patel et al . , 2015 ) . Phase separation provides a mechanism by which such gene products result in aberrant Figure 5 .

HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC ( ATCC CRL - 3216 ) and cultured in DMEM , high glucose , pyruvate ( GIBCO 11995 - 073 ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , characterized SH3007103 ) , 100 U / mL Penicillin - Streptomycin ( GIBCO 15140 ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( Invitrogen , 25030 - 081 ) . Cells were negative for mycoplasma . METHOD DETAILS Immunoﬂuorescence with RNA FISH Coverslips were coated at 37 (cid:3) C with 5ug / mL poly - L - ornithine ( Sigma - Aldrich , P4957 ) for 30 minutes and 5 m g / mL of Laminin ( Corning , 354232 ) for 2 hours . Cells were plated on the pre - coated coverslips and grown for 24 hours followed by ﬁxation using 4 % paraformaldehyde , PFA , ( VWR , BT140770 ) in PBS for 10 minutes . After washing cells three times in PBS , the coverslips were put into a humidifying chamber or stored at 4 (cid:3) C in PBS . Permeabilization of cells were performed using 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma Aldrich , X100 ) in PBS for 10 minutes followed by three PBS washes . Cells were blocked with 4 % IgG - free Bovine Serum Albumin , BSA , ( VWR , 102643 - 516 ) for 30 minutes and the indicated primary antibody ( see table S2 ) was added at a concentration of 1 : 500 in PBS for 4 - 16 hours . Cells were washed with PBS three times followed by incubation with secondary antibody at a concentration of 1 : 5000 in PBS for 1 hour . After washing twice with PBS , cells were ﬁxed using 4 % paraformaldehyde , PFA , ( VWR , BT140770 ) in PBS for 10 minutes .

After washing with Wash buffer A for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:3) C , the nuclei were stained with 20 m m / mL Hoechst 33258 ( Life Tech - nologies , H3569 ) for 5 minutes , followed by a 5 minute wash in Wash buffer B ( Biosearch Technologies , SMF - WB1 - 20 ) . Cells were washed once in water followed by mounting the coverslip onto glass slides with Vectashield ( VWR , 101098 - 042 ) and ﬁnally sealing the coverslip with nail polish ( Electron Microscopy Science Nm , 72180 ) . Images were acquired at an RPI Spinning Disk confocal microscope with a 100x objective using MetaMorph acquisition software and a Hammamatsu ORCA - ER CCD camera ( W . M . Keck Microscopy Facility , MIT ) . Images were post - processed using Fiji Is Just ImageJ ( FIJI ) . Immunoﬂuorescence with DNA FISH Immunoﬂuorescence was performed as previously described above . After incubating the cells with the secondary antibodies , cells were washed three times in PBS for 5min at RT , ﬁxed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 10min and washed three times in PBS . Cells were incubated in 70 % ethanol , 85 % ethanol and then 100 % ethanol for 1 minute at RT . Probe hybridization mixture was made mixing 7 m L of FISH Hybridization Buffer ( Agilent G9400A ) , 1 m L of FISH probe ( see below for region ) and 2 m L of water . 5 m L of mixture was added on a slide and coverslip was placed on top ( cell - side toward the hybridization mixture ) . Coverslips were sealed using rub - ber cement . Once rubber cement solidiﬁed , genomic DNA and probes were denatured at 78 (cid:3) C for 5 minutes and slides were incu - bated at 16 (cid:3) C in the dark O / N . The coverslip was removed from the slide and incubated in pre - warmed Wash buffer 1 ( Agilent , G9401A ) at 73 (cid:3) C for 2 minutes and in Wash Buffer 2 ( Agilent , G9402A ) for 1 minute at RT . Slides were air dried and nuclei were stained with Hoechst in PBS for 5 minutes at RT .

Cells were grown at 37 (cid:3) C with 5 % CO2 in a humidiﬁed incubator . For confocal imaging , cells were grown on glass coverslips ( Carolina Biological Supply , 633029 ) , coated with 5 m g / mL of poly - L - ornithine ( Sigma Aldrich , P4957 ) for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:3) C and with 5 m g / ml of Laminin ( Corning , 354232 ) for 2hrs - 16hrs at 37 (cid:3) C . For passaging , cells were washed in PBS ( Life Technologies , AM9625 ) , 1000 U / mL LIF . TrypLE Express Enzyme ( Life Technologies , 12604021 ) was used to detach cells from plates . TrypLE was quenched with FBS / LIF - media ( ( DMEM K / O ( GIBCO , 10829 - 018 ) , 1X nonessential amino acids , 1 % Penicillin Streptomycin , 2mM L - Glutamine , 0 . 1mM b - mercaptoethanol and 15 % Fetal Bovine Serum , FBS , ( Sigma Aldrich , F4135 ) ) . Cells were spun at 1000rpm for 3 minutes at RT , resuspended in 2i media and 5x10 6 cells were plated in a 15 cm dish . For differentiation of mESCs , 6000 cells were plated per well of a 6 well tissue culture dish , or 1000 cells were plated per well of a 24 well plate with a laminin coated glass coverslip . After 24 hours , 2i media was replaced with FBS media ( above ) without LIF . Media was changed daily for 5 days , cells were then harvested . Western blot Cells were lysed in Cell Lytic M ( Sigma - Aldrich C2978 ) with protease inhibitors ( Roche , 11697498001 ) . Lysate was run on a 3 % – 8 % Tris - acetate gel or 10 % Bis - Tris gel or 3 % – 8 % Bis - Tris gels at 80 V for (cid:1) 2 hr , followed by 120 V until dye front reached the end of the gel . Protein was then wet transferred to a 0 . 45 m m PVDF membrane ( Millipore , IPVH00010 ) in ice - cold transfer buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine , 10 % methanol ) at 300 mA for 2 hours at 4 (cid:3) C . After transfer the membrane was blocked with 5 % non - fat milk in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature , shaking . Membrane was then incubated with 1 : 1 , 000 of the indicated antibody ( Table S2 ) diluted in 5 % non - fat milk in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C , with shaking . In the morning , the membrane was washed three times with TBST for 5 minutes at room temperature shaking for each wash . Membrane was incubated with 1 : 5 , 000 secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT and washed three times in TBST for 5 minutes . Membranes were developed with ECL substrate ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , 34080 ) and imaged using a CCD camera or exposed using ﬁlm or with high sensitivity ECL . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) qPCR and sequencing mES were grown to 80 % conﬂuence in 2i media . 1 % formaldehyde in PBS was used for crosslinking of cells for 15 minutes , followed by quenching with Glycine at a ﬁnal concentration of 125mM on ice .

Collected cells were pelleted at 1000 g for 3 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C , ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C . All buffers contained freshly prepared cOmplete protease inhibitors ( Roche , 11873580001 ) . Frozen crosslinked cells were thawed on ice and then resuspended in lysis buffer I ( 50 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 , protease inhibitors ) and rotated for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C , then spun at 1350 r cf . , for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C . The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer II ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , protease inhibitors ) and rotated for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C and spun at 1350 r cf . for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C . The pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % SDS , and 1 % Triton X - 100 , protease inhibitors ) and then sonicated on a Misonix 3000 sonicator for 10 cycles at 30 s each on ice ( 18 - 21 W ) with 60 s on ice between cycles . Sonicated lysates were cleared once by centrifugation at 16 , 000 r cf . for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C . Input material was reserved and the remainder was incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with magnetic beads bound with antibody ( Table S2 ) to enrich for DNA fragments bound by the indicated factor . Beads were washed twice with each of the following buffers : wash buffer A ( 50 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 . e1 – e9 , December 13 , 2018 e4 0 . 1 % Na - Deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , wash buffer B ( 50 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 9 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % Na - Deoxycholate , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , wash buffer C ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 250 mM LiCl , 1 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 % Na - Deoxycholate , 0 . 5 % IGEPAL C - 630 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , wash buffer D ( TE with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ) , and TE buffer . DNA was eluted off the beads by incubation at 65 (cid:3) C for 1 hour with intermittent vortexing in elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM EDTA , 1 % SDS ) . Cross - links were reversed overnight at 65 (cid:3) C . To purify eluted DNA , 200 m L TE was added and then RNA was degraded by the addition of 2 . 5 m L of 33 mg / mL RNase A ( Sigma , R4642 ) and incubation at 37 (cid:3) C for 2 hours . Protein was degraded by the addition of 10 m L of 20 mg / mL proteinase K ( Invitrogen , 25530049 ) and incubation at 55 (cid:3) C for 2 hours . A phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol extraction was performed followed by an ethanol precipitation . The DNA was then resuspended in 50 m L TE and used for either qPCR or sequencing . For ChIP - qPCR experiments , qPCR was performed using Power SYBR Green mix ( Life Technologies # 4367659 ) on either a QuantStudio 5 or a QuantStudio 6 System ( Life Technologies ) . RNA - Seq RNA - Seq was performed in the indicated cell line with the indicated treatment , and used to determine expressed genes . RNA was isolated by AllPrep Kit ( QIAGEN 80204 ) and polyA selected libraries were prepared using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit ( Kapa Biosystems KK8505 ) according to manufacturer’s protocol , and single - end sequenced on a Hi - seq 2500 instrument . Protein puriﬁcation cDNA encoding the genes of interest or their IDRs were cloned into a modiﬁed version of a T7 pET expression vector . The base vector was engineered to include a 5 0 6xHIS followed by either mEGFP or mCherry and a 14 amino acid linker sequence ‘‘GAPGSAGSAAGGSG . ’’ NEBuilder (cid:2) HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix ( NEB E2621S ) was used to insert these sequences ( generated by PCR ) in - frame with the linker amino acids . Vectors expressing mEGFP or mCherry alone contain the linker sequence followed by a STOP codon . Mutant sequences were synthesized as geneblocks ( IDT ) and inserted into the same base vector as described above . All expression constructs were sequenced to ensure sequence identity . For protein expression , plasmids were transformed into LOBSTR cells ( gift of Chessman Lab ) and grown as follows . A fresh bacterial colony was inoculated into LB media containing kana - mycin and chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 (cid:3) C . Cells containing the MED1 - IDR constructs were diluted 1 : 30 in 500ml room temperature LB with freshly added kanamycin and chloramphenicol and grown 1 . 5 hours at 16 (cid:3) C . IPTG was added to 1mM and growth continued for 18 hours . Cells were collected and stored frozen at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C . Cells containing all other constructs were treated in a similar manner except they were grown for 5 hours at 37 (cid:3) C after IPTG induction . Pellets of 500ml of cMyc and Nanog cells were resuspended in 15ml of denaturing buffer ( 50mM Tris 7 . 5 , 300mM NaCl , 10mM imidazole , 8M Urea ) containing cOmplete protease inhibitors ( Roche , 11873580001 ) and sonicated ( ten cycles of 15 s on , 60 s off ) . The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 30 minutes and added to 1ml of Ni - NTA agarose ( Invitrogen , R901 - 15 ) that had been pre - equilibrated with 10 volumes of the same buffer . Tubes containing this agarose lysate slurry were rotated for 1 . 5 hours . The slurry was poured into a column , washed with 15 volumes of the lysis buffer and eluted 4 X with denaturing buffer containing 250mM imidazole . Each fraction was run on a 12 % gel and proteins of the correct size were dialyzed ﬁrst against buffer ( 50mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 125Mm NaCl , 1Mm DTT and 4M Urea ) , followed by the same buffer containing 2M Urea and lastly 2 changes of buffer with 10 % Glycerol , no Urea . Any precipitate after dialysis was removed by centrifugation at 3 . 000rpm for 10 minutes . All other proteins were puriﬁed in a similar manner . 500ml cell pellets were resuspended in 15ml of Buffer A ( 50mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl ) containing 10mM imidazole and cOmplete protease inhibitors , sonicated , lysates cleared by centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 30 minutes at 4 (cid:3) C , added to 1ml of pre - equilibrated Ni - NTA agarose , and rotated at 4 (cid:3) C for 1 . 5 hours . The slurry was poured into a column , washed with 15 volumes of Buffer A containing 10mM imidazole and protein was eluted 2 X with Buffer A containing 50mM imidazole , 2 X with Buffer A containing 100mM imidazole , and 3 X with Buffer A containing 250mM imidazole . Alternatively , the resin slurry was centrifuged at 3 , 000rpm for 10 minutes , washed with 15 volumes of Buffer and proteins were eluted by incubation for 10 or more minutes rotating with each of the buffers above ( 50mM , 100mM and 250mM imidazole ) followed by centrifugation and gel analysis . Fractions containing protein of the correct size were dialyzed against two changes of buffer containing 50mM Tris 7 . 5 , 125mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol and 1mM DTT at 4 (cid:3) C . In vitro droplet assay Recombinant GFP or mCherry fusion proteins were concentrated and desalted to an appropriate protein concentration and 125mM NaCl using Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁlters ( 30K MWCO , Millipore ) . Recombinant proteins were added to solutions at varying concen - trations with indicated ﬁnal salt and 10 % PEG - 8000 as crowding agent in Droplet Formation Buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 10 % glyc - erol , 1mM DTT ) . The protein solution was immediately loaded onto a homemade chamber comprising a glass slide with a coverslip attached by two parallel strips of double - sided tape . Slides were then imaged with an Andor confocal microscope with a 150x objec - tive . Unless indicated , images presented are of droplets settled on the glass coverslip . For experiments with ﬂuorescently labeled polypeptides , the indicated decapeptides were synthesized by the Koch Institute / MIT Biopolymers & Proteomics Core Facility with a TMR ﬂuorescent tag . The protein of interest was added Buffer D with 125mM NaCl and 10 % Peg - 8000 with the indicated poly - peptide and imaged as described above . For FRAP of in vitro droplets 5 pulses of laser at a 50us dwell time was applied to the droplet , and recovery was imaged on an Andor microscope every 1 s for the indicated time periods . For estrogen stimulation experiments , fresh B - Estradiol ( E8875 Sigma ) was reconstituted to 10mM in 100 % EtOH then diluted in 125mM NaCl droplet formation buffer to e5 Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 . e1 – e9 , December 13 , 2018 100uM . One microliter of this concentrated stock was used in a 10uL droplet formation reaction to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 10uM . Genome editing and protein degradation The CRISPR / Cas9 system was used to genetically engineer ESC lines . Target - speciﬁc oligonucleotides were cloned into a plasmid carrying a codon - optimized version of Cas9 with GFP ( gift from R . Jaenisch ) . The sequences of the DNA targeted ( the protospacer adjacent motif is underlined ) are listed in the same table . For the generation of the endogenously tagged lines , 1 million Med1 - mEGFP tagged mES cells were transfected with 2 . 5 mg Cas9 plasmid containing the guide sequence below ( pX330 - GFP - Oct4 ) and 1 . 25 mg non - linearized repair plasmid 1 ( pUC19 - Oct4 - FKBP - BFP ) and 1 . 25 mg non - linearized repair plasmid 2 ( pUC19 - Oct4 - FKBP - mcherry ) ( Table S3 ) . Cells were sorted after 48 hours for the presence of GFP . Cells were expanded for ﬁve days and then sorted again for double positive mCherry and BFP cells . Forty thousand mCherry + / BFP + sorted cells were plated in a six - well plate in a serial dilution . The cells were grown for approximately one week in 2i medium and then individual colonies were picked using a stereoscope into a 96 - well plate . Cells were expanded and genotyped by PCR , degradation was conﬁrmed by western blot and IF . Clones with a ho - mozygous knock - in tag were further expanded and used for experiments . A clonal homozygous knock - in line expressing FKBP tagged Oct4 was used for the degradation experiments . Cells were grown in 2i and then treated with dTAG - 47 at a concentration of 100 nM for 24 hours , then harvested . Oct4 Guide sequence tgcattcaaactgaggcacc * NGG ( PAM ) GAL4 transcription assay Transcription factor constructs were assembled in a mammalian expression vector containing an SV40 promoter driving expression of a GAL4 DNA - binding domain . Wild - type and mutant activation domains of Oct4 and Gcn4 were fused to the C terminus of the DNA - binding domain by Gibson cloning ( NEB 2621S ) , joined by the linker GAPGSAGSAAGGSG . These transcription factor con - structs were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermoﬁsher L3000015 ) into HEK293T cells ( ATCC CRL - 3216 ) or V6 . 5 mouse embryonic stem cells , that were grown in white ﬂat - bottom 96 - well assay plates ( Costar 3917 ) . The transcription factor constructs were co - transfected with a modiﬁed version of the PGL3 - Basic ( Promega ) vector containing ﬁve GAL4 upstream activation sites upstream of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene . Also co - transfected was pRL - SV40 ( Promega ) , a plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene driven by an SV40 promoter . 24 hours after transfection , luminescence generated by each luciferase protein was measured using the Dual - glo Luciferase Assay System ( Promega E2920 ) . The data as presented has been controlled for Renilla luciferase expression . Lac binding assay Constructs were assembled by NEB HIFI cloning in pSV2 mammalian expression vector containing an SV40 promoter driving expres - sion of a CFP - LacI fusion protein . The activation domains and mutant activation domains of Gcn4 were fused by the c - terminus to this recombinant protein , joined by the linker sequence GAPGSAGSAAGGSG . U2OS - 268 cells containing a stably integrated array of (cid:1) 51 , 000 Lac - repressor binding sites ( a gift of the Spector laboratory ) were transfected using lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermoﬁsher L3000015 ) . 24 hours after transfection , cells were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated glass coverslips . After 24 hours on glass coverslips , cells were ﬁxed for immunoﬂuorescence with a MED1 antibody ( Table S2 ) as described above and imaged , by spinning disk confocal microscopy . Puriﬁcation of CDK8 - Mediator The CDK8 - Mediator samples were puriﬁed as described ( Meyer et al . , 2008 ) with modiﬁcations . Prior to afﬁnity puriﬁcation , the P0 . 5M / QFT fraction was concentrated , to 12 mg / mL , by ammonium sulfate precipitation ( 35 % ) . The pellet was resuspended in pH 7 . 9 buffer containing 20 mM KCl , 20mM HEPES , 0 . 1mM EDTA , 2mM MgCl 2 , 20 % glycerol and then dialyzed against pH 7 . 9 buffer containing 0 . 15M KCl , 20mM HEPES , 0 . 1mM EDTA , 20 % glycerol and 0 . 02 % NP - 40 prior to the afﬁnity puriﬁcation step . Afﬁnity puriﬁcation was carried out as described ( Meyer et al . , 2008 ) , eluted material was loaded onto a 2 . 2mL centrifuge tube con - taining 2mL 0 . 15M KCl HEMG ( 20mM HEPES , 0 . 1mM EDTA , 2mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol ) and centrifuged at 50K RPM for 4h at 4 (cid:3) C . This served to remove excess free GST - SREBP and to concentrate the CDK8 - Mediator in the ﬁnal fraction . Prior to droplet assays , puriﬁed CDK8 - Mediator was concentrated using Microcon - 30kDa Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel - 30 membrane ( Millipore MRCF0R030 ) to reach (cid:1) 300nM of Mediator complex . Concentrated CDK8 - Mediator was added to the droplet assay to a ﬁnal con - centration of (cid:1) 200nM with or without 10 m M indicated GFP - tagged protein . Droplet reactions contained 10 % PEG - 8000 and 140mM salt . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Experimental design All experiments were replicated . For the speciﬁc number of replicates done see either the ﬁgure legends or the speciﬁc section below . No aspect of the study was done blinded . Sample size was not predetermined and no outliers were excluded . Cell 175 , 1842 – 1855 . e1 – e9 , December 13 , 2018 e6 Average image and radial distribution analysis For analysis of RNA FISH with immunoﬂuorescence custom in - house MATLAB scripts were written to process and analyze 3D image data gathered in FISH ( RNA / DNA ) and IF channels . FISH foci were manually identiﬁed in individual z stacks through intensity thresh - olds , centered along a box of size l = 2 . 9 m m , and stitched together in 3 - D across z stacks . The called FISH foci are cross - referenced against a manually curated list of FISH foci to remove false positives , which arise due to extra - nuclear signal or blips . For every RNA FISH focus identiﬁed , signal from the corresponding location in the IF channel is gathered in the l x l square centered at the RNA FISH focus at every corresponding z - slice . The IF signal centered at FISH foci for each FISH and IF pair are then combined and an average intensity projection is calculated , providing averaged data for IF signal intensity within a l x l square centered at FISH foci . The same process was carried out for the FISH signal intensity centered on its own coordinates , providing averaged data for FISH signal in - tensity within a l x l square centered at FISH foci . As a control , this same process was carried out for IF signal centered at randomly selected nuclear positions . Randomly selected nuclear positions were identiﬁed for each image set by ﬁrst identifying nuclear volume and then selecting positions within that volume . Nuclear volumes were determined from DAPI staining through the z stack image , which was then processed through a custom CellProﬁler pipeline ( included as auxiliary ﬁle ) . Brieﬂy , this pipeline rescales the image intensity , condenses the image to 20 % of original size for speed of processing , enhances detected speckles , ﬁlters median signal , thresholds bodies , removes holes , ﬁlters the median signal , dilates the image back to original size , watersheds nuclei , and converts the resulting objects into a black and white image . This black and white image is used as input for a custom R script that uses read - TIFF and im ( from spatstat ) to select 40 random nuclear voxels per image set . These average intensity projections were then used to generate 2D contour maps of the signal intensity or radial distribution plots . Contour plots are generated using in - built functions in MATLAB . The intensity radial function ( ( r ) ) is computed from the average data . For the contour plots , the intensity - color ranges presented were customized across a linear range of colors ( n ! = 15 ) . For the FISH channel , black to magenta was used . For the IF channel , we used chroma . js ( an online color generator ) to generate colors across 15 bins , with the key transition colors chosen as black , blueviolet , mediumblue , lime . This was done to ensure that the reader’s eye could more readily detect the contrast in signal . The generated colormap was employed to 15 evenly spaced intensity bins for all IF plots . The averaged IF centered at FISH or at randomly selected nuclear locations are plotted using the same color scale , set to include the minimum and maximum signal from each plot . For DNA FISH analysis FISH foci were manually identiﬁed in individual z stacks through intensity thresholds in FIJI and marked as a reference area . The reference areas were then transferred to the MED1 IF channel of the image and the average IF signal within the FISH focus was determined . The average signal across 5 images comprising greater than 10 cells per image was averaged to calculate the mean MED1 IF intensity associated with the DNA FISH focus . Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR and sequencing ( ChIP ) analysis Values displayed in the ﬁgures were normalized to the input . The average WT normalized values and standard deviation are dis - played . The primers used are listed below . ChIP values at the region of interest ( ROI ) were normalized to input values ( fold input ) and for the mir290 enhancer an additional negative region ( negative norm ) . Values are displayed as normalized to the ES state in dif - ferentiation experiments and to DMSO control in OCT4 degradation experiments ( control normalization ) . qPCR reactions were per - formed in technical triplicate .

Wiggle ﬁles for display of read coverage in bins were created using MACS with parameters – w – S – space = 50 – nomodel – shiftsize = 200 , and read counts per bin were normalized to the millions of mapped reads used to make the wiggle ﬁle . Reads - per - million - normalized wiggle ﬁles were displayed in the UCSC genome browser . ChIP - Seq tracks shown in Figure 1 are derived from GEO : GSM1082340 ( OCT4 ) and GEO : GSM560348 ( MED1 ) from Whyte et al . ( 2013 ) . Super - enhancers and typical en - hancers and their associated genes in cells grown in 2i conditions were downloaded from Sabari et al . , 2018 . Distributions of occupancy fold - changes were calculated using bamToGFF ( https : / / github . com / BradnerLab / pipeline ) to quantify coverage in super - enhancers and typical enhancers from cells grown in 2i conditions . Reads overlapping each typical and super - enhancer were determined using bamToGFF with parameters - e 200 - f 1 - t TRUE and were subsequently normalized to the millions of mapped reads ( RPM ) . RPM - normalized input read counts from each condition were then subtracted from RPM - normalized ChIP - Seq read counts from the corresponding condition . Values from regions wherein this subtraction resulted in a negative number were set to 0 . Log2 fold - changes were calculated between DMSO - treated ( normal OCT4 amount ) and dTAG - treated ( depleted OCT4 ) ; one pseudocount was added to each condition . Super - enhancer identiﬁcation Super - enhancers were identiﬁed as described in Whyte et al . ( 2013 ) . Peaks of enrichment in MED1 were identiﬁed using MACS with – p 1e - 9 – keep - dup = 1 and input control . MED1 aligned reads from the untreated condition and corresponding peaks of MED1 were used as input for ROSE ( https : / / bitbucket . org / young _ computation / ) with parameters - s 12500 - t 2000 - g mm9 and input control . A custom gene list was created by adding D7Ertd143e , and removing Mir290 , Mir291a , Mir291b , Mir292 , Mir293 , Mir294 , and Mir295 to prevent these nearby microRNAs that are part of the same transcript from being multiply counted . Stitched enhancers ( super - enhancers and typical enhancers ) were assigned to the single expressed RefSeq transcript whose promoter was nearest the center of the stitched enhancer . Expressed transcripts were deﬁned as above . RNA - Seq analysis For analysis , raw reads were aligned to the mm9 revision of the mouse reference genome using hisat2 with default parameters . Gene name - level read count quantiﬁcation was performed with htseq - count with parameters - I gene _ id – stranded = reverse - f bam - m intersection - strict and a GTF containing transcript positions from Refseq , downloaded 6 / 6 / 18 . Normalized counts , normalized fold - changes , and differential expression p values were determined using DEseq2 using the standard workﬂow and both replicates of each condition . Enrichment and charge analysis of OCT4 Amino acid composition plots were generated using R by plotting the amino acid identity of each residue along the amino acid sequence of the protein . Net charge per residue for OCT4 was determined by computing the average amino acid charge along the OCT4 amino acid sequence in a 5 amino acid sliding window using the localCIDER package ( Holehouse et al . , 2017 ) . Disorder enrichment analysis A list of human transcription factors protein sequences is used for all analysis on TFs , as deﬁned in ( Saint - andre´ et al . , 2016 ) . The reference human proteome ( Uniprot UP000005640 ) is used to distill the list ( down to (cid:1) 1200 proteins ) , mostly removing non - canonical isoforms . Transcriptional coactivators and Pol II associated proteins were identiﬁed in humans using the GO enrichments IDS GO : 0003713 and GO : 0045944 . The reference human proteome deﬁned above was used to generate list of all human proteins , and peroxisome and Golgi proteins were identiﬁed from Uniprot reviewed lists . For each protein , D2P2 was used to assay disorder propensity for each amino acid . An amino acid in a protein is considered disordered if at least 75 % of the algorithms employed by D2P2 ( Oates et al . , 2013 ) predict the residue to be disordered . Additionally , for transcription factors , all annotated PFAM domains were identiﬁed ( 5741 in total , 180 unique domains ) . Cross - referencing PFAM annotation for known DNA - binding activity , a subset of 45 unique high - conﬁdence DNA - binding domains were identiﬁed , accounting for (cid:1) 85 % of all identiﬁed domains . The vast majority of TFs ( > 95 % ) had at least one identiﬁed DNA - binding domain . Disorder scores were computed for all DNA - binding regions in every TF , as well as the remaining part of the sequence , which includes most identiﬁed trans - activation domains . Imaging analysis of in vitro droplets To analyze in - vitro phase separation imaging experiments , custom MATLAB scripts were written to identify droplets and characterize their size and shape . For any particular experimental condition , intensity thresholds based on the peak of the histogram and size thresholds ( 2 pixel radius ) were employed to segment the image . Droplet identiﬁcation was performed on the ‘‘scaffold’’ channel ( MED1 in case of MED1 + TFs , GCN4 for GCN4 + MED15 ) , and areas and aspect ratios were determined . To calculate enrichment for the in vitro droplet assay , droplets were deﬁned as a region of interest in FIJI by the scaffold channel , and the maximum signal of the client within that droplet was determined . Scaffolds chosen were MED1 , Mediator complex , or GCN4 . This was divided by the background client signal in the image to generate a Cin / out . Enrichment scores were calculated by dividing the Cin / out of the experimental condition by the Cin / out of a control ﬂuorescent protein ( either GFP or mCherry ) .
