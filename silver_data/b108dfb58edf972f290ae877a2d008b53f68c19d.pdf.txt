Putting the Squeeze on Airway Epithelia Asthma is characterized by chronic inﬂammation , airway hyperresponsiveness , and progressive airway remodeling . The airway epithelium is known to play a critical role in the initiation and perpetuation of these processes . Here , we review how excessive epithelial stress generated by bronchoconstriction is sufﬁcient to induce airway remodeling , even in the absence of inﬂammatory cells . Jin - Ah Park , Jeffrey J .

These irritants provoke inﬂammation and ac - tivate signaling cascades that protect lung function ordinarily but can disrupt lung function when they become dysregulated . In addition to these external exposures , the lung has internal challenges . With each respiratory cycle , for example , lung size changes appreciably ( 24 , 59 , 88 ) , and the associ - ated physical distortion is linked to the distortion of the lung’s multiple cellular constituents ( 26 , 27 , 130 ) . Resulting mechanical stresses acting on each of these cellular constituents has the capacity to modify the cellular microenvironment and activate cell signaling ( 27 , 64 , 70 ) . It is well known that mechanical stress is critical to lung development in utero ; mechanical stress guides branching morphogenesis and alveolar growth and thus results in the attainment of nor - mal lung function in adult life ( 81 , 115 ) . During lung development , mechanical stresses promote cell proliferation and differentiation through the activation of signaling pathways that affect the pro - duction of extracellular matrix molecules and the expression of speciﬁc genes ( 57 ) . Unlike these or - dinary stresses , excessive mechanical stresses gen - erated under certain pathological conditions not only impair protective functions but also lead to injury and aberrant repair ( 88 ) . Perhaps the most well known of these effects is ventilator - induced lung injury , which is associated with the applica - tion of mechanical ventilation for life support ( 88 ) ; in patients with this condition , excessive mechan - ical stresses are transmitted across the pleural sur - faces and alveolar walls to constituent cells ( 83 , 108 ) . A rather different example , and the one that comprises the focus of this review , is the effect of mechanical stresses imposed by constricted airway smooth muscle during asthmatic exacerbations . Here , we address the biological and physical im - pact of these mechanical stresses on airway epi - thelial cells and the subsequent impact on progressive airway remodeling in asthma . Airway Remodeling in Asthma Asthma is a common clinical syndrome that ac - counts for substantial morbidity and affects 5 - 10 % of the population in developed countries . It is as - sociated with a global economic burden of billions of dollars per year ( 31 , 123 ) . Asthma is character - ized by chronic airway inﬂammation and intermit - tent episodic bronchoconstriction , both of which are associated with the clinical manifestations that characterize this condition ( 6 , 8 ) . In patients with chronic persistent asthma , the airway progressively undergoes structural changes that are collectively termed airway remodeling ( Table 1 ) ; these changes include goblet - cell hyperplasia , thickening of the subepithelium with collagen deposition , angiogen - esis of the subepithelial vascular plexi , and hyper - trophy and hyperplasia of smooth - muscle cells ( 18 , 41 , 43 , 56 , 75 ) . Airway remodeling is thought to contribute to the decline in lung function that oc - curs in some patients with asthma ( 6 , 8 ) . Although the precise cause of airway remodeling remains unknown , it is thought to derive from the inﬂam - matory microenvironment of the asthmatic airway wall ( 18 , 41 , 43 , 56 , 75 ) . Thus most theories of airway remodeling have attributed the observed changes to the effects of mediators and cytokines derived from inﬂammatory cells , with little or no attention paid to the impact of bronchoconstric - tion itself . In this article , we review evidence that bronchoconstriction itself , even in the absence of inﬂammation , can induce airway remodeling . Magnitude of Compressive Stress During Bronchoconstriction The airways of all vertebrate species are lined with epithelial cells that form the air - tissue interface ( 23 ) . During normal respiration , the magnitude of transmural and transepithelial stresses is low and on the order of transpulmonary pressure ( 62 ) . However , during bronchoconstriction , the associ - ated mechanical stress causes the airway wall to buckle , leading to the formation of rosette patterns [ as seen on cross - section images in the article by PHYSIOLOGY 30 : 293 – 303 , 2015 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / physiol . 00004 . 2015 1548 - 9213 / 15 ©2015 Int . Union Physiol . Sci . / Am . Physiol . Soc . 293 Yager et al . ( 129 ) ] . This occurs because the base - ment membrane has the mechanical characteris - tics of a bicycle chain , stiff in extension but ﬂoppy in compression ( 129 ) . The precise patterns of col - lapse vary depending on the mechanical properties of the elements of the airway wall ; in patients with asthma , in whom the airway wall is thickened ( 17 , 41 ) , numerous epithelial cells are apposed to each other and squeezed , and thus subjected to appre - ciable mechanical compressive stress ( 55 , 125 ) . To estimate the magnitude of the stress imposed on the cells , Wiggs et al . ( 125 ) used ﬁnite - element methods to analyze the rosette patterns of defor - mation that are formed during bronchocons - triction ( 129 ) . They estimated the mechanical properties of the two layers that were used to model the airway wall and estimate the hoop stress that airway smooth muscle would exert during maximal bronchoconstriction . On the basis of these assumptions , they found that , during maxi - mal bronchoconstriction , airway epithelial cells are subjected to compressive stress at a magnitude of (cid:2) 30 cmH 2 O , which is at least an order of magni - tude greater than the magnitude of transepithelial stress on airway epithelial cells during normal breathing . Biological Effects of Compressive Stress on Airway Epithelial Cells To determine whether stress of this magnitude has a biological impact on airway epithelial cells , Ressler et al . ( 73 ) used an in vitro model . Rat tra - cheal epithelial cells were grown in air - liquid interface ( ALI ) culture , and mechanical stress mimicking the stress generated during bronchoc - onstriction was modeled through the applica - tion of transepithelial air - pressure gradients ( FIGURE 1 ) . The study shows that airway epithelial cells respond rapidly and robustly to compressive stress ( 73 ) . Ressler et al . speciﬁcally used the ex - pression of genes known to be mechanically sen - sitive in other systems as markers of the biological effects of compressive stress . They found that such stress induces the expression of RNA encoding early growth response 1 ( Egr - 1 ) , endothelin 1 , and transforming growth factor (cid:3) 1 ( TGF - (cid:3) 1 ) . They ob - served that the magnitude of the response is both pressure - dependent and time - dependent . In addi - tion , they found that physiological pressure gradi - ents at a magnitude of 3 cmH 2 O have no impact on gene expression , whereas pressure gradients at a magnitude of 30 cmH 2 O result in substantial ex - pression of the sentinel transcripts that were monitored . Tschumperlin et al . ( 109 ) extended these studies with the use of human airway epithelial cells ; in their initial studies , they found that the behavior of human airway epithelial cells in ALI culture is very similar to that of rat tracheal epithelial cells . Fur - thermore , they used imaging techniques to show that compressive stress reduces the height of air - way epithelial cells by (cid:2) 10 % , which forces the cells to expand into the lateral intercellular space ( i . e . , the space between adjacent epithelial cells ) . Since the cells were cultured on a porous membrane , liquid in the lateral intercellular space was forced out of the membrane pores ; Tschumperlin et al . postulated that the applied mechanical force reca - pitulated the mechanical impact of buckling in constricted airways ( 109 ) . In the same report , they suggested that the compressive stress - induced re - duction in the volume of the lateral intercellular space , coupled with the continued shedding of ligands into that space , most likely results in an increase in concentration of at least one type of shed ligand [ epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ] , which in turn could initiate the observed biological downstream effects . This postulated mechanism of mechanotransduction does not require the pres - ence of a molecular entity that senses the compres - sion ; rather , the transduction is triggered by loss of volume in the lateral intercellular space and a con - tinued ﬁxed rate of shedding of ligands into that space . In a follow - up study , Tschumperlin et al . used ﬁnite - element methods to calculate the potential concentrations of ligands in the lateral intercellular space ( 52 ) . Using reasonable assumptions , they found that alterations in the geometry of the lateral intercellular space could impact the concentra - tions of constitutively shed ligands inside and be - low the cell layer . In their model , the maximal change in volume of the lateral intercellular space occurred (cid:2) 10 min after the application of com - pressive stress . Finally , they used a three - dimen - sional imaging technique , with better temporal and spatial resolution than had been available at the time their initial work was done , to observe the evolution of mechanotransduction responses through changes in the concentration of local EGF Table 1 . The role of bronchoconstriction in airway remodeling Feature of Airway Remodeling Recapitulated by Experiments In Vitro Compressive System ( FIGURES 1 AND 2 ) Brochoconstriction in Humans ( FIGURE 3 ) Inﬂammation Possible ( 11 , 109 ) Not detected ( 34 ) Subepithelial collagen deposition Collagen type III ( 93 ) Collagen type III ( 34 ) Goblet cell hyperplasia MUC5AC positive cells ( 69 ) PAS staining ( 34 ) Airway smooth muscle proliferation and contraction Not determined Not determined Airway angiogenesis Not determined Not determined PHYSIOLOGY (cid:129) Volume 30 (cid:129) July 2015 (cid:129) www . physiologyonline . org 294 ligands such as heparin - binding EGF ( HB - EGF ) and transforming growth factor (cid:4) ( TGF - (cid:4) ) ( 52 ) . They found that highly localized changes in ligand concentrations can be induced through mechani - cal loading , depending on both local deformations and the effects of ligand convection . They sug - gested that these localized ligand concentrations could lead to heterogeneity of cellular responses . Shiomi et al . ( 87 ) continued these studies with the use of airway epithelial cells harvested from mice . Tschumperlin et al . had previously found that bronchoconstriction activates EGF receptor ( EGFR ) in the airway epithelium in mice ; EGFR phosphorylation was induced in isolated murine lungs perfused via the trachea with methacholine but not in lungs perfused with PBS ( 109 ) . Shiomi et al . found that the application of compressive stress to differentiated mouse tracheal epithelial cells in ALI culture induces phosphorylation of extracellu - lar signal - related kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 and ERK2 ) through EGFR activation ; this response is similar to the responses detected in rat cells and human cells . The application of compressive stress also induces the expression of genes encoding EGF li - gands such as HB - EGF , epiregulin , amphiregulin , and betacellulin . Shiomi et al . used airway epithe - lial cells derived from mice with a deﬁciency of tumor necrosis factor (cid:4) ( TNF - (cid:4) ) converting en - zyme ( TACE ) and found that TACE is a critical upstream molecule in the EGFR activation re - sponse to compressive stress . These ﬁndings establish that mouse , rat , and human airway epithelial cells in ALI culture all have a predictable biological response to compres - sive stress . However , the nature of this response and its relationship to airway remodeling require further understanding . Extent to Which Compressive Stress Recapitulates Changes Consistent With Airway Remodeling EGFR Activation Studies from a number of investigative groups have shown that there are fundamental disorders in the asthmatic airway epithelium ; the asthmatic epithelium has an aberrant repair process in which inﬂammatory signals are sustained by uncon - trolled EGFR activation ( 38 , 40 , 71 , 94 ) . The defor - mation of airway epithelial cells that is caused by compressive stress not only activates EGFR but also affects EGFR - dependent transcriptomes in bronchial epithelial cells ( 51 ) , indicating that com - pressive stress - induced local and transient defor - mation of epithelial cells recapitulates key characteristics of the asthmatic airway epithelium . Compressive stress stimulates the phosphoryla - tion of extracellular ERK and the expression of HB - EGF ( 111 ) . The HB - EGF response to compres - sive stress is similar to that elicited in the same cells by exposure to TNF - (cid:4) ( 1 ng / ml ) ; combined mechanical and inﬂammatory stimulation is more effective than stimulation with either stimulus alone . Moreover , it has been shown that the induc - tion of HB - EGF is EGFR - dependent ; this suggests the presence of a mechanically activated EGFR autocrine loop with positive feedback that involves selected EGFR ligands ( 11 ) . Activation of the Plasminogen System The plasminogen system consists of serine pro - teases and their inhibitors ; the system is not only involved in the cascade of actions leading to blood clotting but also activated in tissue repair ( 44 ) . Activation of this system depends on an enzymatic chain reaction that is mainly regulated by two tryp - sin - like proteases : tissue plasminogen activator ( t - PA ) and urokinase plasminogen activator ( u - PA ) ( 53 , 82 , 116 ) . In asthma , expression of the u - PA receptor ( uPAR ) is increased in the airway epithelium ( 91 ) . Increased uPAR expression leads to the attenua - tion of wound - repair processes and may in turn contribute to the development and progression of airway remodeling in asthma .

Chu et al . ( 10 ) found that the application of the compressive stress to human airway epithelial cells in ALI culture induces the expression of genes and proteins related to the plasminogen system , including u - PA , uPAR , plasminogen ac - tivator inhibitor 1 ( PAI - 1 ) , and t - PA , as well as the activity of plasminogen activators . Results from this study further support the idea that compressive stress on airway epithelial cells , in the absence of inﬂammatory cells , can lead to processes that are characteristic of asthma , such as the induction of changes that are found in the hyperresponsive airway ( 121 ) and the initiation of events that lead to subepithelial ﬁbrosis ( 86 ) . Furthermore , expression of the gene encoding uPAR , PLAUR , has been associated with asthma susceptibility , and polymorphisms in that gene have been associated with differences in baseline lung function ( 92 ) . Collagen Deposition In asthma , deposition of extracellular matrix is a component of the thickened subepithelium ( 18 , 41 , 56 , 74 , 75 ) . Roche et al . ( 75 ) have shown that the thickened subepithelium is composed of a layer of matrix that is positive for ﬁbronectin and collagen types III and V ; the collective amount of these materials is doubled in asthmatic airways ( the tis - sue layer is 10 – 15 (cid:5) m ) compared with the amount in normal airways ( 5 – 8 (cid:5) m ) . Swartz et al . ( 93 ) expanded the model of com - pressive stress on airway epithelial cells to include a layer of reporter ﬁbroblasts at the base of the Transwell used for ALI culture . These reporter cells are not exposed to mechanical stress but rather are bathed in a culture medium conditioned by cells in ALI culture that have been exposed to mechanical stress . This model allowed the investigators to ex - amine how compressive stress on cells in ALI cul - ture could facilitate intercellular communication between compressed epithelial cells and reporter ﬁbroblasts ( 93 ) ; application of compressive stress on bronchial epithelial cells in ALI culture was associated with the release of ﬂuid - phase signals and led to the proliferation of reporter ﬁbroblasts and the production of collagen types I and III from these cells ( FIGURE 2 ) . As noted above , a cardinal feature of airway remodeling is deposi - tion of collagen types I and III below the basement membrane of the airway ( 18 , 41 , 56 , 75 ) , and this study establishes that this feature of airway remod - eling can be induced in vitro in the absence of inﬂammatory cells . Goblet Cell Hyperplasia Goblet cells produce mucins , which form hydrated polymer gels ( mucus ) that line the airways ( 78 , 126 ) . Under normal conditions , mucus provides a pivotal defense against inhaled particles by trap - ping and facilitating mucociliary clearance , in co - operation with cilia in ciliated cells ( 50 ) . However , in chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , mucus hyperse - cretion occurs , in part because of goblet - cell meta - plasia and hyperplasia , and contributes to the morbidity and mortality associated with these air - way diseases ( 13 , 14 , 21 , 65 , 126 ) . Goblet - cell hy - perplasia is a major remodeling event in asthma ( 16 , 17 , 37 , 41 , 56 ) . Culture of primary normal hu - man bronchial epithelial ( NHBE ) cells recapitu - lates the differentiated phenotypes of airway epithelial cells that are seen in vivo ( 79 , 124 , 128 ) and is routinely used to study the underlying mechanism of goblet - cell hyperplasia ( 35 , 101 , 124 , 128 ) . In vitro culture of NHBE cells has shown that cytokines associated with a Th2 response ( i . e . , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , and IL - 13 ) ( 2 , 77 , 131 ) , human neutrophil elastase ( HNE ) ( 67 , 120 ) , and cigarette smoking ( 76 ) induce goblet - cell hyperplasia and mucin overproduction . Park and Tschumperlin ( 69 ) reported that me - chanical compressive stress can induce goblet - cell hyperplasia in the absence of inﬂammatory cells and mediators . They applied intermittent com - pressive stress , mimicking the episodic reversible airway obstruction that occurs during asthma ex - acerbations , to well differentiated NHBE cells in ALI culture for an hour every day for 14 consecu - tive days , starting on the 14th day after ALI culture was established . The number of goblet cells was signiﬁcantly increased in cells exposed to com - pressive stress , compared with the number in con - trol cells ; this was seen as early as 7 days after the initial application of compressive stress . Compres - sive stress - mediated goblet - cell hyperplasia is de - pendent on the activation of EGFR and TGF - (cid:3) 2 . EGFR is an important signaling molecule in goblet - cell hyperplasia that is induced by other mediators such as IL - 13 and HNE ( 7 , 76 , 112 , 131 ) . Chu et al . previously found that the expression of TGF - (cid:3) 2 is elevated in asthmatic human airways and that TGF - (cid:3) 2 is capable of increasing MUC5AC expres - sion in NHBE cells ( 12 ) . YKL - 40 Expression YKL - 40 , the protein encoded by the Chitinase - 3 - like protein 1 ( CHI3L1 ) gene , has been found in bronchoalveolar ( BAL ) ﬂuid and serum of patients with asthma . In genetic studies , CHI3L1 has been associated with asthma in European and American populations ( 63 , 72 ) , with atopy in a Korean PHYSIOLOGY (cid:129) Volume 30 (cid:129) July 2015 (cid:129) www . physiologyonline . org 296 population ( 89 ) and with a risk of asthma in a Taiwanese population ( 107 ) . Ober et al . ( 63 ) re - ported that CHI3L1 is associated with asthma sus - ceptibility and that an elevated level of circulating YKL - 40 is a biomarker for asthma and an acceler - ated decline in lung function . An increased level of YKL - 40 in the serum and BAL ﬂuid is strongly correlated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and loss of lung function . Park et al . found that human bronchial epithelial cells in ALI culture are a source of YKL - 40 and that the YKL - 40 is released in response to compressive stress in a protein kinase C ( PKC ) - dependent man - ner ( 66 ) . They also found that exposure to TNF - (cid:4) induces the production of YKL - 40 in human bron - chial epithelial cells . In asthma , expression of YKL - 40 in the airway epithelium is positively correlated with smooth - muscle mass and promotes bronchial smooth - muscle cell proliferation and migration through a protease activated receptor 2 ( PAR - 2 ) - dependent mechanism ( 3 ) . Because YKL - 40 has a proangio - genic function , as shown by its promotion of tumoriogenesis ( 85 ) and endothelial - tube forma - tion ( 22 , 85 ) , the compressive stress - induced ex - pression of YKL - 40 might contribute to airway angiogenesis in asthma . Exosome Release Exosomes are small membrane vesicles ( 40 – 120 nm in diameter ) that are released by all types of cells and are found in biological ﬂuids such as serum , BAL ﬂuid , and extracellular matrix ( 99 ) . Exosomes contain lipids , proteins , and genetic ma - terial such as mRNA and miRNA ( 61 , 114 ) ; they constitute an effective vehicle to deliver molecules from one cell to another and thus function as a vehicle for intercellular communication ( 20 , 98 , 100 , 103 ) . Park et al . reported that human bronchial epi - thelial cells in ALI culture release exosomes con - taining tissue factor in response to compressive stress ( 68 ) . Exosomes are released basolaterally and contain transmembrane proteins , including EGFR and tissue factor . In a study in which cells were incubated with a PKC inhibitor , bisindolyl - maleimide I , the release of exosomes containing tissue factor was dependent on PKC activation . The importance of exosome release from epithe - lial cells is an area of active research . Vlahakis and Hubmayr ( 118 ) hypothesized that plasma mem - brane stress failure is a central event in the patho - physiology of ventilation - induced lung injury . They described deformation - induced lipid trafﬁck - ing ( DILT ) in alveolar epithelial cells , and hypoth - esized that DILT is an adaptive mechanism that facilitates membrane growth and ultimately pre - vents membrane rupture after mechanical stress is applied to the plasma membrane during hyperven - tilation ( 119 ) . A disrupted plasma membrane is rapidly resealed , and the resealing process de - pends on the exocytotic mechanism ( 102 ) . Togo et al . described the healing process in the disrupted membrane of double - wounded ﬁbroblast : at ﬁrst wounding , an endocytic process adds the mem - brane necessary for resealing to the endocytotic compartment , and at second wounding , PKC , which is activated through Ca 2 (cid:6) entry at ﬁrst wounding , stimulates vesicle formation from the Golgi apparatus , resulting in rapid resealing of the second membrane disruption ( 102 ) . Wirtz et al . ( 127 ) also found that the transient increase in Ca 2 (cid:6) is a critical step in exocytosis in mechanically stretched alveolar epithelial cells . It seems logical to assume that the exocytosis that occurs in alveolar epithelial cells and the re - lease of exosomes from bronchial epithelial cells in ALI culture that occurs after the application of FIGURE 2 .

Differential Responses to Compressive Stress in Normal and Asthmatic Cells Airway epithelial cells from asthmatic airways have clear differences from those found in normal air - ways , including impaired proliferation of basal and club cells , exaggerated secretion of cytokines and proteins associated with inﬂammation and remod - eling , reduced expression of junction proteins , and aberrant injury - repair responses ( 39 , 56 , 58 ) . In one study in which the response to compressive stress in normal cells was compared with the response in cells from asthmatic donors , higher levels of TGF - (cid:3) and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) were released from cells derived from asthmatic donors ( 33 ) . Unfortunately , the data on this subject are limited , and more research is needed to clarify the fundamental differences between airway epithelial cells from normal do - nors and asthmatic donors . Role of Bronchoconstriction in Airway Remodeling in Humans Studies performed by Swartz et al . ( 93 ) and by Park and Tschumperlin ( 69 ) provide direct evidence that compressive mechanical stress , in the absence of inﬂammatory cells , can induce key phenotypic changes observed asthmatic airways . The results of these in vitro studies were later validated in hu - mans by Grainge et al . ( 34 ) . The investigators in - duced bronchoconstriction in two groups of patients with mild cases of asthma by means of either repeated methacholine challenges or re - peated allergen challenges . The challenges were performed four times at 2 - day intervals , and trans - bronchial biopsies were performed 4 days after the last exposure . In addition , half the patients in the methacholine group received the challenges after pretreatment with albuterol to determine whether a bronchodilator is able to modify the histological and biochemical effects caused by the methacho - line challenges . Airway remodeling was induced in patients in both the methacholine - alone group and the allergen group ; compared with the base - line levels in those patients , there were an in - creased number of goblet cells ( positive Periodic acid - Schiff stain ) and a thickened subepithelium ( positive stain for antibody against collagen type III ) ( FIGURE 3 ) . There were no signiﬁcant differ - ences between the allergen and the methacholine groups with respect to these changes . Inﬁltration of eosinophils was present in patients in the aller - gen group but not in those in the methacholine group , despite the remodeling events . Moreover , the methacholine - induced remodeling events were abrogated by pretreatment with albuterol , which inhibits bronchoconstriction , suggesting that bronchoconstriction alone can induce airway re - modeling in humans . This clinical observation val - idates previous in vitro studies and provides strong evidence that compressive stress on airway epithe - lial cells is an important component of the clinical asthmatic response . In addition to this study of airway constriction , there is a clinical mirror of mechanically induced airway narrowing in asthma . Numerous studies have shown that the combination of a long - acting beta - agonist ( LABA ) and an inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) is a far more effective treatment for asthma than high doses of ICS alone ( 36 , 49 , 54 ) . These studies suggest that bronchodilation adds thera - peutic beneﬁt to inhaled corticosteroids , and it is not unreasonable to assume that this beneﬁt de - rives from the “virtual anti - inﬂammatory effect” of bronchodilation . We do not believe that mechani - cal compression is the sole mechanism by which asthma exacerbates , so it is not surprising that bronchodilators on their own do not have anti - remodeling effects . Rather , we think that broncho - dilation adds a dimension to asthma treatment that is not achieved by anti - inﬂammatory treat - ment alone . This idea is reinforced by the work of Kips et al . ( 49 ) , who found that treatment with a combination of a low - dose ICS ( budesonide ) and a LABA ( formoterol ) has the same anti - inﬂammatory effects as treatment with a high - dose ICS ( budes - onide ) . In a study performed by Kelly et al . involv - ing mildly asthmatic patients who were challenged with allergens , treatment with a combination of a LABA ( formoterol ) and an inhaled ICS ( budes - onide ) resulted in fewer myoﬁbroblast numbers and smaller smooth muscle mass than treatment with either component alone ( 47 ) . If we make the reasonable assumption that the anti - inﬂammatory effects of ICS are dose - related , then the logical conclusion is that LABA augments the anti - inﬂam - matory effect of ICS , as we contend through an anti - constriction mechanism as reviewed herein . Unanswered Questions Alteration of Innate Immunity Beyond the scope of remodeling , we speculate about unanswered questions and new approaches to explore unknown roles of mechanical stress in lung function and lung disease . For example , does bronchoconstriction impair the innate immune re - sponses of airway epithelial cells ? Recent studies have shown that EGFR activation induced by viral infection suppresses the production of interfer - on - (cid:7) and CXCL - 10 , both of which have antiviral PHYSIOLOGY (cid:129) Volume 30 (cid:129) July 2015 (cid:129) www . physiologyonline . org 298 functions in the airway epithelium ( 45 , 113 ) . These studies raise the question of whether bronchocon - striction impairs host defense mechanisms against viral infections through the induction of EGFR in patients with asthma . Grainge et al . have shown that compression induces secretion of IL - 8 ( 33 ) , although the mechanism remains unknown , and Huang et al . have shown that a static compression of A549 cells at a magnitude of 15 cmH 2 O , which is much lower than the magnitude of pressure mea - sured in constricted airways , activates NF - (cid:8) B ( 42 ) . Compression - mediated activation of NF - (cid:8) B is further induced by the pretreatment with jas - plakinolide , an actin - polymerizing reagent . These observations suggest that bronchocon - striction itself probably alters the innate immu - nity of the airway epithelium . Therefore , further studies are needed for a better understanding of the relationship between mechanobiology and in - nate immunity . Collective Migration Aberrant injury - repair response is a hallmark of asthma , but little is known about if or how me - chanical stress contributes to this process . During the injury and repair process , it is well established that airway epithelial cells rapidly migrate to ﬁll denuded areas and then further differentiate to restore normal barrier protective functions ( 19 ) . It is known that coordinated communication be - tween biochemical and mechanical signals guides the development and the maturation of the epithe - lium ( 32 ) . In addition , migration of cells requires the initiation and transmission of physical forces from one cell to its immediate neighbors ( 1 , 48 , 96 , 104 – 106 , 117 , 122 ) . In collective cellular migration , cells act together in a coordinated fashion rather than as individual units ( 29 ) . This collective behav - ior is not unique to the airway epithelial layer ; it is seen also in tissue - remodeling events that underlie embryonic morphogenesis , wound repair , and cancer invasion ( 29 , 80 ) , in which cells move in A B CC DD FIGURE 3 .

The multiple factors contributing to collective migration of cells can include cellular crowding , intercellular force transmission , cadherin - depen - dent cell - cell adhesion , integrin - dependent cell - substrate adhesion , myosin - dependent motile force and contractility , actin - dependent deform - ability , proliferation , stretch , and compression ( 4 , 15 , 25 , 46 , 90 , 122 ) . New tools are now available for studying the physical forces that each cell exerts on its substrate ( 9 , 95 ) and the physical forces that each cell exerts on its immediate neighbors ( 48 , 96 ) . These new experimental approaches have led to the discovery that cellular collectives can be - come jammed , much as coffee beans become jammed in a chute ( 1 , 5 , 30 , 96 , 105 ) . The jammed state is a solid - like state in which intercellular re - arrangements are arrested ( 1 , 30 , 84 , 96 ) . Alterna - tively , in certain circumstances , the cellular collective can become unjammed and undergo a transition to a ﬂuid - like state in which relatively rapid intercellular rearrangements are potentiated ( 84 , 96 ) . We have proposed recently that these transitions between solid - like states and ﬂuid - like states of the cellular collective might be governed by a jamming phase diagram ( FIGURE 4 ) ( 80 ) . However , the existence and nature of cell jamming in human bronchial epithelial cells and its relation - ship to asthma have yet to be studied . Conclusions Compressive stress in vitro , mimicking the stress generated by bronchoconstriction in vivo , is sufﬁ - cient to induce cellular changes consistent with airway remodeling , even in the absence of inﬂam - matory cells or mediators . These in vitro studies were subsequently validated in living humans with the use of methacholine challenges . Together , this evidence suggests that bronchoconstriction is not only a consequence of asthma development and airway remodeling but also a rather important contributor .
