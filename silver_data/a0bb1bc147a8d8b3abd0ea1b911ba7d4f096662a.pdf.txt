SUMMARY The acclimation of plants to changes in light intensity requires rapid responses at several different levels . These include biochemical and biophysical responses as well as alterations in the steady - state level of differ - ent transcripts and proteins . Recent studies utilizing promoter : : reporter constructs suggested that transcrip - tional responses to changes in light intensity could occur within seconds , rates for which changes in mRNA expression are not routinely measured or functionally studied . To identify and characterize rapid changes in the steady - state level of different transcripts in response to light stress we performed RNA sequencing anal - ysis of Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to light stress . Here we report that mRNA accumulation of 731 transcripts occurs as early as 20 – 60 sec following light stress application , and that at least ﬁve of these early response transcripts play an important biological role in the acclimation of plants to light stress . More than 20 % of transcripts accumulating in plants within 20 – 60 sec of initiation of light stress are H 2 O 2 - and ABA - response transcripts , and the accumulation of several of these transcripts is inhibited by transcriptional inhi - bitors . In accordance with the association of rapid response transcripts with H 2 O 2 and ABA signaling , a mutant impaired in ABA sensing ( abi - 1 ) was found to be more tolerant to light stress , and the response of several of the rapid response transcripts was altered in mutants impaired in reactive oxygen metabolism . Our ﬁndings reveal that transcriptome reprogramming in plants could occur within seconds of initiation of abiotic stress and that this response could invoke known as well as unknown proteins and pathways . Keywords : Arabidopsis thaliana , transcription , RNA - Seq , light stress , ultra - fast . INTRODUCTION Playing a principal role in sustaining life on Earth , plants convert solar radiation into bio - available energy . Unable to avoid abiotic stress by means of relocation , plants have evolved sophisticated acclimation mechanisms to cope with changes in their environment . These include sensing , signal transduction and stress protection proteins and pathways ( Nakashima and Yamaguchi - Shinozaki , 2006 ; Bailey - Serres and Voesenek , 2008 ; Cavanagh et al . , 2008 ; Munns and Tester , 2008 ; Chinnusamy and Zhu , 2009 ; Mittler and Blumwald , 2010 ) . Although changes in environ - mental conditions could occur within seconds in nature , studies attempting to dissect the responses of plants to abiotic stress have traditionally focused on events occur - ring 10 – 30 min or hours after application of abiotic stress ( Mittler et al . , 2012 ) . Recent studies have nonetheless indi - cated that the response of plants to abiotic stress could occur much faster than previously measured , and that changes in environmental conditions such as temperature © 2015 The Authors The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd .

Even a gradual change in environmental conditions could trigger a rapid response once a particular physiologi - cal or biochemical sensing threshold is passed ( Mittler et al . , 2012 ) . Alterations in metabolites and RNA species could result from stress - induced differential enzymatic co - efﬁciencies , RNA transcription and processing , or metabo - lite and RNA stability . These could in turn reprogram the cell metabolome and transcriptome and trigger speciﬁc sensors for abiotic stress response that would in turn acti - vate multiple signal transduction pathways and result in the mounting of a full - scale acclimation response ( Mittler et al . , 2012 ) . Although much is known about the different signaling and downstream pathways that mediate the acclimation of plants to stress , virtually nothing is known about the rapid changes in the metabolome and transcrip - tome of plants that occur within seconds to minutes of ini - tiation of abiotic stress ( Mittler et al . , 2012 ; Suzuki et al . , 2013a , b ; Gilroy et al . , 2014 ; Miller et al . , 2009 ) . We recently reported on the detection of ultra - fast changes in the metabolome of plants subjected to high - light stress , with changes in many metabolites occurring as early as 15 sec after the application of light stress ( Suzuki et al . , 2013a ) . Using a Zat12 : : luciferase reporter system , we also reported on the existence in plants of a rapid local and systemic signal termed the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) wave that is activated by different abiotic stresses and propagates at rates of up to 8 . 4 cm min (cid:1) 1 ( Miller et al . , 2009 ; Mittler et al . , 2011 ) . Those reports , as well as a recent report on the existence of a rapid local and systemic ‘calcium wave’ ( Choi et al . , 2014 ) , and the possi - ble integration of the two ( Gilroy et al . , 2014 ) , suggest that transcription , RNA stability and / or RNA processing responses in plants could occur at a much faster rate than is typically studied . Moreover , if such rapid responses occur , and have an important biological function , then the lack of data for early time points in many of the abiotic stress - response transcriptome studies deposited in differ - ent gene and data banks ( e . g . Hruz et al . , 2008 ; https : / / gen - evestigator . com / gv / ) could hamper our attempts to develop crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses because many of the important early response genes will be missed . In support of the possibility that the steady - state transcript level of many genes could be enhanced within seconds of initiation of abiotic stress are measure - ments of transcription rates in eukaryotic cells nearing or exceeding 50 kb min (cid:1) 1 ( Maiuri et al . , 2011 ) , and the discov - ery that many genes in eukaryotic cells contain stalled RNA polymerases at their promoters and could mount a rapid transcriptional response following changes in environmental conditions ( Nechaev and Adelman , 2008 ; Levine , 2011 ; Kwak and Lis , 2013 ) . Here we uncover the ultra - fast transcriptome response of plants triggered by light stress . This response includes the ordered and clustered mRNA accumulation of 731 tran - scripts that occurs as early as 20 – 60 sec after application of light stress . We further determined that ﬁve of the tran - scripts involved in this ultra - fast response play an impor - tant biological role in the acclimation of plants to light stress , that many of the ultra - fast light stress - response transcripts are H 2 O 2 - or ABA - response transcripts , and that the accumulation of several of the ultra - fast response tran - scripts is inhibited by transcriptional inhibitors . We also report that a mutant impaired in ABA sensing ( abi - 1 ) is more tolerant to light stress , and that the response of sev - eral of the rapid response transcripts was altered in mutants impaired in ROS metabolism / signaling . Our ﬁnd - ings reveal that transcriptome reprogramming in plants occurs at a much faster rate than is typically studied and that this response could involve known as well as unknown transcripts and pathways . Because several of the genes identiﬁed as ultra - fast light response genes appear to be important for acclimation to light stress , our studies highlight the need to study the ultra - fast transcriptional response of plants to other abiotic or biotic stresses that may include important , but as - yet unidentiﬁed , genes for acclimation to abiotic stress and / or plant resistance to pathogens and pests . RESULTS RNA sequencing ( RNA - Seq ) analysis of the ultra - fast response of Arabidopsis to light stress Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to light stress for 0 , 20 , 30 , 60 and 90 sec were used for transcriptome ( RNA - Seq ; 0 , 20 , 60 sec ) and quantitative ( q ) PCR analyses and H 2 O 2 measurements ( 0 , 20 , 30 , 60 or 90 sec ) in three bio - logical replicates ( Figure 1 and Figure S1a in Supporting Information ) . Each biological replicate contained three technical replicates of 15 – 20 plants each , grown in pots for 18 – 21 days , exposed to a light intensity of 1000 l mol m (cid:1) 2 sec (cid:1) 1 at 21 ° C , and immediately dipped in liquid nitrogen . The steady - state level of 731 transcripts was found to be signiﬁcantly enhanced in response to light stress within 20 – 60 sec . These were divided into three clusters based on their expression pattern ( Figure 1a , Tables S1 – S3 ) , indicat - ing a complex response pattern that involved differential timing . Out of the 731 transcripts shown in Figure 1 , 49 were found not to be annotated on the ATH1 Affymetrix chips ( Table S4 ) . Interestingly , only 34 transcripts out of the 731 shown in Figure 1 ( a ) increased in expression from a very low basal level [ below 2 . 0 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped ( FPKM ) ; Table S5 ] . The steady - state level of 419 and 668 transcripts © 2015 The Authors The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd . , The Plant Journal , ( 2015 ) , 84 , 760 – 772 Ultra - fast transcriptome remodeling 761 signiﬁcantly declined at 20 and 60 sec of light stress , respectively ( Tables S6 and S7 ) . As shown in Figure 1 ( b ) , qPCR analysis conﬁrmed the expression of selected tran - scripts from Cluster I . It should be noted that few transcripts included in Cluster I in some experiments could be found in Clusters II or III in other experiments . These differences , detected by qPCR , could result from small vari - ations in the physiological pre - conditioning of plants used for the different experiments or from the stochastic nature of the transcriptional response in different cells belonging to the same tissue ( Stegle et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , enhanced cellular levels of H 2 O 2 were not detected during early stages of light stress ( Figure 1b ) . This ﬁnding could be linked to the high content of antioxidants in plants , gen - erating a buffer against rapid changes in ROS ( Mittler , 2002 ; Halliwell , 2006 ) . In accordance with this hypothesis , the level of ascorbic acid rapidly decreased in response to light stress in Arabidopsis in a process that was dependent on the presence of ascorbate peroxidase 1 ( APX1 ; Davle - tova et al . , 2005a ) , an ascorbate - dependent H 2 O 2 - scaven - ging enzyme ( Figure 1c ) . This ﬁnding demonstrated that APX1 could be directly involved in scavenging of H 2 O 2 pro - duced during the initial response to light stress , and that during this process the stored levels of ascorbic acid are utilized as part of the Asada – Foyer – Halliwell pathway ( Fig - ure 1c ; Halliwell , 2006 ) . The majority of transcripts belonging to all ultra - fast response clusters were annotated as stress , abiotic or bio - tic response transcripts based on their Gene Ontology ( GO ) annotation ( Figure 2a ) , and genes encoding the bulk of these transcripts were scattered on all Arabidopsis chro - mosomes , with only a few clustering at certain locations ( Figure S1b ) . A breakdown of the overlap between responses to different biotic / abiotic stresses and the differ - ent transcripts found in each of the ultra - fast response cluster indicated that many of the transcripts with an enhanced steady - state level in response to light stress are also responsive to abiotic stresses such as drought , cold , heat and salinity , demonstrating their possible involve - ment in tolerance of abiotic stress in plants ( Figure 2b ; ATH1 chip data were obtained from the supplementary material of Huang et al . , 2008 ; Matsui et al . , 2008 ; Larkin - dale and Vierling , 2008 ; Kleine et al . , 2007 ; Ding et al . , 2014 ; Tosti et al . , 2006 ; Consales et al . , 2012 ; Truman et al . , 2006 ) .

Out of these 502 transcripts , 245 transcripts ( Table S8 ) were also not found to be included in the response of plants to the stresses shown in Figure 2 ( b ) . Of course , 49 of these were not represented in the ATH1 chips ( Table S4 ) . These transcripts could therefore represent a unique group of transcripts that are relatively more speciﬁc to the ultra - fast response ( Table S8 ) . Functional characterization of ultra - fast response transcripts in Arabidopsis To determine whether some of the ultra - fast response tran - scripts play a biological role in the acclimation of plants to light stress , we obtained from the SALK collection knock - out mutants for 70 genes encoding transcripts with altered Cluster I Cluster II Cluster III Total 384 274 73 Abiotic stresses Drought 59 ( 15 % ) 83 ( 30 % ) 21 ( 29 % ) Cold 120 ( 31 % ) 13 ( 5 % ) 19 ( 26 % ) Heat 59 ( 15 % ) 59 ( 21 % ) 34 ( 46 % ) High light 64 ( 17 % ) 64 ( 23 % ) 21 ( 29 % ) NaCl 116 ( 30 % ) 20 ( 7 % ) 5 ( 7 % ) Ozone 89 ( 23 % ) 5 ( 2 % ) 4 ( 5 % ) Wounding 22 ( 6 % ) 5 ( 2 % ) 4 ( 5 % ) Incompatible bacterial pathogen 43 ( 11 % ) 2 ( 0 . 7 % ) 0 128 80 21 Ultra - fast HL ( 731 ) HL ( 992 ) 86 H 2 O 2 ( 562 ) 375 757 502 ( 245 ) ( 49 ) Cluster ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 2 .

Seven knockouts showed enhanced cell death in response to light stress and a second independent knockout was obtained for these and screened again . As shown in Fig - ure 3 ( a ) , ﬁve genes were found to be important for accli - mation to light stress using two independent knockouts . They encoded two proteins of unknown function ( At5g10695 and At3g10020 ) , a Golgi - associated protein ( At5g51430 ) , a RAV transcription factor ( At1g25560 ) and a glycosyl hydrolase ( At3g13750 ) , and were required to pre - vent light - induced cell death in Arabidopsis leaves . It should also be mentioned that a sixth protein identiﬁed by our analysis , Zat12 ( Figure 1b ) , was previously shown to be required for acclimation to light stress ( Iida et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , as shown in Figure 3 ( b ) , none of the ﬁve tran - scripts functionally characterized in Figure 3 ( a ) was induced in response to the 3 - h light stress treatment ( Kleine et al . , 2007 ) . Also , none of the ﬁve transcripts shown in Figure 3 ( a ) was found to be enhanced in a time - course experiment subjecting Arabidopsis to light stress as reported in Davletova et al . ( 2005a ; Figures S2 and S3 ) . The ﬁve ultra - fast transcripts assayed in Figure 3 ( a ) were there - fore primarily induced during early stages of the response of Arabidopsis to light stress ( with two of them also induced by H 2 O 2 ; Figure 3b ) . Our ﬁnding that these tran - scripts were primarily induced during the rapid response of plants to light stress , but not during later stages of this response ( Figures 3b , S2 and S3 ; Davletova et al . , 2005a ; Kleine et al . , 2007 ) , highlight their potential biological role in protecting plants from light stress ( Figure 3a ) , thus demonstrating that the rapid response is important for the tolerance of plants to light stress . Transcriptional regulation of ultra - fast response transcripts To determine if some of the ultra - fast transcripts identiﬁed by our analysis ( Figure 1 ) were regulated , at least partially , at the transcriptional level , we used qPCR to test whether transcriptional inhibitors such as a - amanitin and actino - mycin D would suppress their accumulation . We selected four different transcripts with a deﬁned response pattern conﬁrmed by qPCR for this analysis ( Figure 4 ) . As can be seen in Figure 4 ( a ) , changes in transcript accumulation , visualized by RNA - Seq read alignment maps , could be seen for the four selected transcripts across the entire length of their corresponding genes with some genes changing in expression two - to three - fold within 20 sec of light stress . Pre - treatment with a - amanitin or actinomycin D suppressed the accumulation of all four selected tran - scripts ( Figure 4b ) , demonstrating that at least some of the transcripts accumulating at 20 sec of light stress could require active transcription for their regulation . To further determine if the steady - state transcript level of some of the ultra - fast response transcripts is enhanced transcriptionally within seconds after light stress , we con - structed different reporter genes in which the WRKY40 and the Zat12 promoters were fused to an unstable variant of the luciferase gene ( Luc u ) .

In addition , we used qPCR to measure the accu - mulation of the luciferase transcripts in Zat12 : : luc ( Miller et al . , 2009 ; regular stable luciferase fused to the same Zat12 promoter fragment ) plants 20 and 60 sec following application of light stress . As shown in Figure 5 ( b ) , lucifer - ase transcripts driven by the Zat12 promoter could be detected as early as 20 sec following light stress . The ﬁnd - ings shown in Figures 4 ( b ) and 5 suggest that at least some of the transcripts with enhanced steady - state levels at 20 and 60 sec following application of light stress in Ara - bidopsis are driven by the activation of their promoters . Because the steady - state level of many of the transcripts shown in Figure 1 could also be enhanced in response to light stress due to changes in their RNA stability ( i . e . by increased stability during the early stages of light stress ) , we determined the content of 11 different RNA - destabiliz - ing sequences ( Ohme - Takagi et al . , 1993 ; Narsai et al . , 2007 ) in these transcripts and compared it with the content of the same RNA - destabilizing sequences in transcripts induced by light stress at 3 h ( Kleine et al . , 2007 ) . As shown in Figure S4 , the content of the destabilizing sequences was very similar in these two transcript groups . However , further studies are needed to determine the role of RNA stability in the ultra - fast response of Arabidopsis to light stress .

Twelve to 21 % of transcripts from Cluster I were also brassinolide - , jasmonate - and H 2 O 2 - response transcripts . These ﬁndings suggest that Cluster I is distinct from Clusters II and III in its content of hormone - response transcripts ( Figure 6a ) . To further test the dependence of the ultra - fast response on ABA signaling we studied the response of selected mutants impaired in ABA and retrograde signaling to light stress using the assay described in Figure 3 ( a ) . For this analysis we used aba - 1 , deﬁcient in ABA biosynthesis , abi - 1 , deﬁcient in ABA sensing via protein phosphatase 2C that is involved in NADPH oxidase activation in response to ABA , and abi - 4 and gun - 1 , deﬁcient in retrograde signaling from the chloroplast to the nuclei ( Koussevitzky et al . , 2007 ; Suzuki et al . , 2013a ) . As shown in Figure 6 ( b ) , of the different mutants tested only the abi - 1 mutant displayed enhanced tolerance to light stress , potentially due to an enhanced content of stress - response transcripts or deﬁ - ciency in ABA - induced NADPH oxidase activation . Because protein phosphatase 2C ( ABI - 1 ) activity could be directly suppressed by enhanced H 2 O 2 levels , or by enhanced ABA levels ( through PYR / PYL ; Mittler and Blumwald , 2015 ) , the ﬁnding that the abi - 1 mutant is impaired in the response to light stress could suggest that this protein is involved , via H 2 O 2 and / or ABA , in early light stress responses in Arabidopsis . Interestingly , as shown in Figure 6 ( c ) , a con - siderable overlap was found between the transcripts upregulated in untreated abi - 1 plants ( Hoth et al . , 2002 ; data obtained from the supplementary material therein ) and the transcripts enhanced in plants subjected to 3 - h light stress ( Kleine et al . , 2007 ) or the ultra - fast high light ( HL ) treatment described in this work . This ﬁnding could suggest that in Arabidopsis deﬁciency in ABI - 1 mimics some aspects of the light stress response and that the abi - 1 mutant is more tolerant to light stress ( Figure 6b ) because it already activates some of these responses . To further test the dependence of some ultra - fast response transcripts on H 2 O 2 / ROS we analyzed the expres - sion of selected ultra - fast response transcripts in mutants impaired in ROS scavenging / signaling such as apx1 , cat2 and rbohD . apx1 and cat2 are impaired in H 2 O 2 scavenging whereas rbohD is impaired ROS signaling ( Torres et al . , 2002 ; Vanderauwera et al . , 2011 ) . As can be seen in Fig - ure 7 , some of the transcripts tested were found to be dependent on ROS scavenging ( WRKY40 ) , some were independent of ROS signaling / scavenging ( WRKY18 and KMD1 ) and some were only partially dependent on ROS scavenging ( Zat12 ) . Interestingly , the response of all tran - scripts tested was unaltered in the rbohD mutant , suggest - ing that RBOHD may not be involved in the regulation of these transcripts and that the possible function of ABI1 in this response could be different from its function in classi - cal ABA sensing . Further studies are of course required to unravel the role of ROS and ABA in the ultra - fast response of plants to light stress . DISCUSSION Several lines of evidence suggest that the ultra - fast tran - scriptome response reported here is biologically - impor - tant . It was composed of 731 transcripts that demonstrated an ordered and clustered response ( Figure 1 , Tables S1 – S3 and S5 – S7 ) ; it included several ultra - fast response - speciﬁc transcripts that were required for acclimation to light stress ( Figure 3 ; Iida et al . , 2000 ) ; the different clusters included in the response were composed of transcripts with differ - ential responsiveness to different abiotic / biotic stresses , 0 20 60 R e l a t i v e t r a n s c r i p t l e v e l ( f o l d c h a n g e ) 2 . 5 2 1 . 5 1 0 . 5 0 Time ( sec ) * * * * ( a ) ( b ) Figure 5 .

ROS or hormones ( Figures 2 and 6 ) ; expression of some of the transcripts involved in the response could be sup - pressed by transcriptional inhibitors ( Figure 4 ) ; and it included transcripts that responded differentially when studied in a genetic background that was altered in ROS scavenging responses ( Figure 7 ) . Taken together , these observations indicate that very rapid responses at the mRNA level in plants could play an important biological role in the acclimation of plants to stress . It is possible that many of the ultra - fast changes observed in the steady - state transcript level in response to light stress in our study ( Figure 1a , b , Tables S1 – S3 and R e l a t i v e c o ndu c t i v i t y ( % o f c o n t r o l ) * * * * * * * * * * Ler aba1 abi1 Col abi4 - 102 gun1 - 9 0 800 100 700 600 500 400 300 200 Control HL 128 39 11 Ultra - fast HL ( 731 ) HL ( 992 ) 80 abi - 1 ( 504 ) 374 773 553 Cluster I Cluster II Cluster III Total 385 274 73 Hormone / ROS ABA 47 ( 12 . 21 ) 62 ( 22 . 63 ) 14 ( 19 . 18 ) ACC 7 ( 1 . 82 ) 7 ( 2 . 55 ) 0 ( 0 . 00 ) Brassinolide 47 ( 12 . 21 ) 5 ( 1 . 82 ) 0 ( 0 . 00 ) Cytokinin 9 ( 2 . 34 ) 3 ( 1 . 09 ) 1 ( 1 . 37 ) Gibberellin 3 ( 0 . 78 ) 0 ( 0 . 00 ) 1 ( 1 . 37 ) Indole - 3 - acetic acid 34 ( 8 . 83 ) 18 ( 6 . 57 ) 0 ( 0 . 00 ) Methyl jasmonate 49 ( 12 . 73 ) 16 ( 5 . 84 ) 7 ( 9 . 59 ) SA 29 ( 7 . 53 ) 1 ( 0 . 36 ) 0 ( 0 . 00 ) H 2 O 2 83 ( 21 . 56 ) 10 ( 3 . 65 ) 8 ( 10 . 96 ) O 2 – 14 ( 3 . 64 ) 1 ( 0 . 36 ) 4 ( 5 . 48 ) 1 O 2 13 ( 3 . 38 ) 4 ( 1 . 46 ) 2 ( 2 . 74 ) ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 6 .

Furthermore , many of the ultra - fast response transcripts contained RNA - destabilizing sequences , albeit not at a proportion higher than late ( 3 h ) light stress - response transcripts ( Figure S4 ) . Nevertheless , the ﬁndings that transcriptional inhibitors suppressed the expression of some ultra - fast response transcripts ( Figure 4 ) , and that the ultra - fast response could be observed via promoter : : re - porter constructs ( Figure 5 ) , combined with several reports of stalled RNA polymerases found on the promoters of eukaryotic genes ( Nechaev and Adelman , 2008 ; Levine , 2011 ; Kwak and Lis , 2013 ) , strongly suggest that some of the ultra - fast response transcripts reported here are regu - lated at the transcriptional level and could contain stalled but active RNA polymerases at their promoters . This possi - bility , combined with reported transcription rates of over 50 kb min (cid:1) 1 in eukaryotic cells ( Maiuri et al . , 2011 ) , could explain the rapid accumulation of some of the transcripts observed in our experiments ( Figures 1 – 4 , Tables S1 – S3 ) , especially considering the relatively short length of Ara - bidopsis genes ( average of 2000 bp ; Arabidopsis Genome Initiative , 2000 ) . Differential RNA stability and stalled RNA polymerases could therefore provide a mechanistic expla - nation for the ultra - fast transcriptome reprograming observed in response to light stress in Arabidopsis . In contrast to the rapid accumulation of different tran - scripts , the ultra - fast transcriptome response of Arabidop - sis to light stress included a rapid decline in the level of many transcripts ( Figure S1a , Tables S6 and S7 ) . Genome - wide analyses of decline of mRNA in Arabidopsis have revealed three different groups of transcripts that are prone to rapid mRNA decline : transcripts encoded by intronless genes , transcripts possessing destabilizing sequences in their 3 0 end and transcripts that are targets of microRNA regulation ( Narsai et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , uncapping - mediated mRNA degradation was found to be associated with abiotic stress responses ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , the majority of studies focusing on mRNA decline in plants did not use short time points such as 20 and 60 sec and further analysis is needed to decipher the mechanisms that regulate mRNA decline under the conditions described in this study . Taking into account the ‘harsh’ biological assay we used to deﬁne a function in light stress acclimation ( i . e . cell death ; Figure 3 ) , it is likely that many other transcripts identiﬁed by our transcriptome analysis could play a role in light stress acclimation , albeit less signiﬁcant than pre - vention of cell death . The relationship between ROS and the expression of many of the genes identiﬁed by our anal - ysis is unclear at present . High levels of ROS did not accu - mulate in cells during the ﬁrst 0 – 90 sec of light stress ( Figure 1b ) , but the expression of some ultra - fast response genes was dependent on ROS signaling ( Figure 7 ) . This ﬁnding suggests that the high antioxidant capacity of plant cells is able to handle the initial rise in ROS produced dur - ing early stages of light stress ( Figure 1c ) , but that several genes that are highly sensitive to ROS levels still react ( Fig - ures 1b and 7 ) . In addition to these , proteins inhibited by H 2 O 2 , such as ABI - 1 , could also be affected by low levels of ROS ( Figure 6b , c ) . The rapid APX1 - dependent depletion of ascorbic acid levels in response to light stress ( Fig - ure 1c ) supports the hypothesis that plants have a high buffering capacity for rapid changes in ROS levels . Key players in the regulation of rapid transcriptional responses could therefore be localized and / or low - level ROS signals , calcium signatures or ABI - 1 and / or conjugated ABA ( Miller et al . , 2009 ; Mittler et al . , 2011 , 2012 ; Suzuki et al . , 2013a ; Choi et al . , 2014 ; Gilroy et al . , 2014 ; Mittler and Blumwald , 2015 ) . Abscisic acid was shown to play a key role in the response of plants to abiotic stresses , and ABA and ROS were shown to coordinate responses to the ROS wave in WRKY40 R e l a t i v e t r a n s c r i p t l e v e l ( F o l d c h a n g e ) WRKY18 Zat12 R e l a t i v e t r a n s c r i p t l e v e l ( F o l d c h a n g e ) Control20 sec HL 60 sec HL WT apx1 cat2 rbohD KMD1 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Control20 sec HL 60 sec HL WT apx1 cat2 rbohD WT apx1 cat2 rbohD Control20 sec HL 60 sec HL R e l a t i v e t r a n s c r i p t l e v e l ( F o l d c h a n g e ) Control20 sec HL 60 sec HL WT apx1 cat2 rbohD R e l a t i v e t r a n s c r i p t l e v e l ( F o l d c h a n g e ) ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 7 .

Our ﬁndings that many of the ultra - fast response transcripts are also ABA - response transcripts ( Figure 6a ) and that the abi - 1 mutant has an impaired response to light stress ( Figure 6b ) is therefore in line with the potential role of ABA in this response . Because , in addition to its function in the ABA pathway , the ABI - 1 pro - tein could also be directly inhibited by H 2 O 2 ( Mittler and Blumwald , 2015 ) , an alternative explanation for our ﬁnd - ings could also be that during the ultra - fast response to light stress the little H 2 O 2 that is accumulated is directly inhibiting this protein . In this case the deﬁciency in ABI - 1 protein in the abi - 1 mutant will mimic the response of these plants to light stress and pre - condition them to resist light ( Figure 6b , c ) . Further studies are required to address these possibilities . Virtually all time - course omics studies of plant or animal responses to abiotic stress lack early time points ( seconds to minutes ; e . g . Hruz et al . , 2008 ) . Our ﬁndings demon - strate that during these early stages of the stress response the cell undergoes a reprogramming of its transcriptome that could affect the activation of signal transduction path - ways and the establishment of successful acclimation . The large number of transcripts that respond to light stress within 20 – 60 sec in Arabidopsis , uncovered by our analysis ( Figure 1 , Tables S1 – S3 and S5 – S7 ) , combined with the important role that some of these early response tran - scripts play in light stress tolerance ( Figure 3 ; Iida et al . , 2000 ) , highlight the importance of these early stages for plant acclimation . Further characterization of these tran - scripts , as well as additional studies of the ultra - fast response of plants to other abiotic and biotic stresses , could lead to the development of new and novel approaches to enhance the tolerance of plants and crops to different environmental stresses using pathways and compounds that were not previously known , or considered to be involved in abiotic stress .

Knockout lines were obtained from ABRC ( http : / / abrc . osu . edu / ) and bulked together with wild - type seeds under carefully controlled growth conditions as previously described ( Suzuki et al . , 2011 ; Luhua et al . , 2013 ) . Zat12 : : luc plants were obtained as described in Miller et al . ( 2009 ) . A similar strategy was also used to fuse the promot - ers of Zat12 ( Miller et al . , 2009 ) and WRKY40 ( 1 . 2 kb ) , to the unsta - ble form of Luciferase [ Promega , http : / / www . promega . com / ; pGL4 . 11 ( luc2p ) , designated here as Luc U ] ( Davletova et al . , 2005b ; Miller et al . , 2009 ) . Luciferase activity was imaged as described by Miller et al . ( 2009 ) . One leaf of 16 - to 20 - day - old plants was sprayed with 1 m M luciferin ( GOLD Biotechnology , https : / / www . - goldbio . com / ) , exposed to light stress ( 1500 l mol m (cid:1) 2 sec (cid:1) 1 ) using a goose neck bulb , and imaged using a NightOWL LB983 NC100 ( Berthold , https : / / www . berthold . com / ) imager . Images were captured every 10 sec for 300 sec . Bioluminescence in photon counts sec (cid:1) 1 was measured using INDIGO v . 2 . 0 . 3 . 0 ( Berthold ) . Trea - ted samples were compared to their respective controls and graphed . Light stress treatment For RNA - Seq , qPCR analyses and measurements of H 2 O 2 and ascorbic acid , 15 – 20 plants grown in pots for 18 – 21 days as described above were exposed to a light intensity of 1000 l mol m (cid:1) 2 sec (cid:1) 1 at 21 ° C for periods of 0 , 20 and 60 sec , 0 , 10 , 60 and 300 sec , or 0 , 20 , 30 , 60 and 90 sec in a growth chamber ( E - 30 - HB , Per - cival Scientiﬁc , http : / / www . percival - scientiﬁc . com / ) . Samples were collected by immediately dipping the pots in liquid nitrogen . Fro - zen tissues were then cut onto aluminum foil , ground and trans - ferred into 1 . 5 - ml tubes ( about 100 – 150 mg per tube ) . Samples were kept frozen during the entire collecting process and stored at (cid:1) 80 ° C . For treatment with transcriptional inhibitors , plants grown in pots were sprayed with water , 10 l M a - amanitin or 75 l g ml (cid:1) 1 actinomycin D and incubated for 90 min at room temperature ( 21 (cid:1) C ) prior to exposure to light stress for periods of 0 , 20 and 60 sec . To test the tolerance of plants to light stress , one fully expanded rosette leaf of 21 - to 25 - day - old plants grown on peat pellets was exposed to 2000 l mol m (cid:1) 2 sec (cid:1) 1 high light for 1 h using a gooseneck light source ( ACE I ; Schott , http : / / www . amsco - pe . com / ) . Leaves were then photographed and analyzed for elec - trolyte leakage as described below . RNA - Seq , qRT - PCR , meta - analyses and ascorbic acid measurements For RNA - Seq analysis , three independent biological replicates , each composed of leaves pooled from at least 30 different plants in three technical repeats , were used for each experimental condi - tion . Total RNA was isolated and puriﬁed as described in Suzuki et al . ( 2013a ) and RNA - Seq analysis was conducted using an Illu - mina HiSeq2000 at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Biotech - nology Gene Expression Center . Gene Ontology annotations of the transcripts identiﬁed by our RNA - seq analyses were per - formed using PANTHER ( http : / / www . pantherdb . org / pathway / ) or obtained from TAIR ( https : / / www . arabidopsis . org / tools / bulk / go / in - dex . jsp ) . Quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) was performed as previously described ( Miller et al . , 2009 ; Suzuki et al . , 2013a ) using a StepOnePlusTM Real - Time PCR Sys - tem ( Applied Biosystems , http : / / www . appliedbiosystems . com / ) . The qPCR data were analyzed with STEPONEPLUS software v . 2 . 0 . 1 ( Applied Biosystems ) . Threshold cycle values for Zat12 , WRKY18 , WRKY40 , APX1 , RbohD , GNAT5 and KMD1 were calculated with the CT of EF1 - a as an internal control .

Levels of ascorbic acid were measured by gas chromatog - raphy – mass spectrometry ( GC - MS ) analysis and expressed as rel - ative to an internal control ( ribitol ) as previously described ( Rizhsky et al . , 2004 ; Suzuki et al . , 2013a ) . H 2 O 2 measurement The accumulation of H 2 O 2 in tissues exposed to the short - term light stress was measured using Amplex Red ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , http : / / www . invitrogen . com / ) . Five hundred microliters of 50 - m M sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 50 l M Amplex Red and 0 . 05 U ml (cid:1) 1 horseradish peroxidase was added to ground tissues and samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 12 min at 4 ° C . Following the centrifugation , 450 l l of supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark . Absorbance at 560 nm was then mea - sured and the concentration of H 2 O 2 in each sample was deter - mined from a standard curve consisting of 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 3 , 6 and 9 l M of H 2 O 2 . Following the measurement of absorbance , tissue sam - ples were completely dried using a speed vacuum concentrator at 30 ° C for 30 min and H 2 O 2 accumulation per mg dry weight was calculated . Electrolyte leakage assay Electrolyte leakage was measured as described by Sung and Guy ( 2003 ) with minor modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , one fully expanded leaf exposed to high light as described above was excised and immersed in 10 ml of distilled , deionized water in a 50 - ml Fal - con tube . Samples were shaken for 1 h at room temperature and the conductivity of the water was measured using a con - ductivity meter ( Sung and Guy , 2003 ) . Samples were then heated to 95 ° C for 20 min using a heat block , shaken for 1 h at room temperature and the conductivity of the water was mea - sured again . The percentage of electrolyte leakage was calcu - lated as the percentage of the conductivity before heating over that after heating . Statistical analysis We performed next generation RNA - Seq for differential expres - sion proﬁling and characterization of transcript processing events . Three biological replicates were obtained as described above . Paired - end Illumina sequencing generated on average 21 million read pairs per sample , with each sequence read having a length of 101 nucleotides . We utilized the services of frequently used , publicly available RNA - Seq analysis software , namely BOWTIE ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) , TOPHAT ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) and CUFFLINKS ( Trapnell et al . , 2010 ) , for alignment of paired - end reads onto the reference genome , parsing the alignment to infer the exon – exon splice junctions , and performing the differential expression analy - sis of annotated genes . Transcripts expressing differentially in two ( or more ) conditions were identiﬁed by examining the difference in their abundance under the two conditions . The abundance of a transcript is measured in terms of FPKM , normalized for the tran - script length and total number of cDNA fragments for a sample replicate . The difference in expression was obtained as the log of fold change in abundance between the two conditions . A test of statistical signiﬁcance for differential expression of each transcript was performed based on a negative binomial model estimated from the data ( Trapnell et al . , 2010 ) . The fold change of genes with multiple isoforms was assessed by summing up the FPKMs for all isoforms of a gene and then measuring the difference between the two conditions ( Trapnell et al . , 2010 ) . Other statistical analyses were performed by one - tailed Student’s t - test as previ - ously described in Suzuki et al . ( 2013a ) . Results are presented as mean (cid:3) SD ( * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ) . We extracted three distinctive patterns representing elevation in steady - state transcript level at 20 or 60 sec or both using a Fortran code on a Unix platform : Cluster I , elevation of steady - state tran - script level at 20 sec followed by decline at 60 sec ; Cluster II , eleva - tion of steady - state transcript level at 60 sec with no signiﬁcant change at 20 sec ; and Cluster III , elevation of steady - state transcript level at 20 sec and 60 sec . Elevation or decline in steady - state transcript level at a particular time point indicated a statisti - cally signiﬁcant increase or decrease , respectively , in steady - state transcript level relative to the previous time point . Steady - state transcript level refers to transcript abundance which is measured in terms of FPKM , normalized for the transcript length and total number of cDNA fragments for a replicate sample .
