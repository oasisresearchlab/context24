Capping protein controls filament growth and actin turnover in cells by binding to the barbed ends of the filaments with high affinity and slow off - rate . The interaction between Capping protein and actin is regulated by capping protein interaction ( CPI ) motif proteins . We identified a novel CPI motif protein , Bsp1 , which is involved in cytokinesis and endocytosis in budding yeast . We demonstrate that Bsp1 is an actin binding protein with a high affinity for capping protein via its CPI motif . In cells , Bsp1 regulates capping protein at endocytic sites and is a major recruiter of capping protein to the cytokinetic actin ring . Lastly , we define Bsp1 - related proteins as a distinct fungi - specific CPI protein group . Our results suggest that Bsp1 promotes actin filament capping by the capping protein . This study establishes Bsp1 as a new capping protein regulator and promising candidate to regulate actin networks in fungi . Introduction In eukaryotes , a coordinated regulation of actin filament assembly and disassembly is required for diverse cellular processes , including cell migration , endocytosis and cytokinesis . A key regulator of actin assembly is the heterodimeric capping protein ( CP ) complex , which binds actin filament barbed ends and thereby prevents further barbed end growth ( Isenberg et al . , 1980 ; Carman et al . , 2023 ) . CP is necessary in maintaining the architecture of branched actin networks . The capping of filaments increases the polymerization rate of other filaments with free barbed ends ( Carlier & Pantaloni , 1997 ; Pantaloni et al . , 2001 ) , enhancing the branched network assembly rates and thus actin - dependent forces that drive membrane deformation . In addition , association of CP to filaments inhibits actin disassembly and recycling . Thus , CP controls filamentous actin ( F - actin ) locally by defining filament lengths and globally by tuning actin turnover . In yeast , CP has a role in regulating actin 2 polymerization at endocytic sites and thereby the growth of endocytic membrane invagination ( Amatruda et al . , 1992 ; Kim et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , a recent study showed that CP also localizes to contractile actin ring in yeast , suggesting an additional role of CP in cytokinesis ( Wirshing et al . , 2023 ) . The activity of CP is finely tuned in cells ( Edwards et al . , 2014 ; Lappalainen et al . , 2022 ) . The uncapping of filament barbed ends is promoted by actin depolymerizing factor homology ( ADF ) domain proteins cofilin ( Miyoshi et al . , 2006 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) and twinfilin ( Hakala et al . , 2021 ; Mwangangi et al . , 2021 ) . In animals , V - 1 binds to CP and prevents its interaction with F - actin barbed ends through direct competition mechanism ( Bhattacharya et al . , 2006 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2014 ) . The activity of CP is regulated by CP interaction motif - containing proteins . The CP interaction ( CPI ) motif binds to CP and has an allosteric effect on the CP complex , leading to dissociation of V - 1 from capping protein and thus promoting F - actin barbed end capping ( Takeda et al . , 2010 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2014 ) . The binding of CPI motif to CP also changes CP dissociation rates from F - actin and CP affinity to actin barbed ends ( Hernandez - Valladares et al . , 2010 ; McConnel et al . , 2020 ; Takeda et al . , 2021 ) . In mammals several protein families , including CARMIL , Fam21 , twinfilin , Cin85 / CD2AP , CapZIP , and CKIP , are known to contain CPI motifs ( Hernandez - Valladares et al . , 2010 ; Edwards et al . , 2014 ; McConnel et al . , 2020 ; Hakala et al . , 2018 ; Johnston et al . , 2018 ; Takeda et al . , 2021 ) . Whereas no V - 1 homologs have been identified in yeasts , the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two established CPI motif proteins , Twf1 and Aim21 ( Falck et al . , 2004 ; Johnston et al . , 2018 ; Shin et al . , 2018 ; Lamb et al . , 2021 ) . Both proteins localize to endocytic actin patches in yeast , regulating actin turnover and the activity of CP ( Goode et al . , 1998 ; Palmgren et al . , 2001 ; Falck et al . , 2004 ; Johnston et al . 2015 , Farrell et al . , 2017 ; Shin et al . , 2018 ; Lamb et al . , 2021 ) . Here we identify Bsp1 as a third fungal CPI motif protein . We found that Bsp1 promotes the localization of CP to both actin patches and the contractile ring through direct interactions 3 with both F - actin and CP . Our sequence analysis reveals that the CPI motif of Bsp1 is closer to those of CKIP and Fam21 , pointing to a pro - capping function of Bsp1 . Combined , our data suggests that Bsp1 is a pro - capping factor in endocytosis and cytokinesis . Results and Discussion Bsp1 domains and localization Bsp1 localizes to endocytic actin patches and cytokinetic actin rings ( Drees et al . , 2001 ; Wright et al . , 2008 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ) . Bsp1 with Iqg1 is essential for actin ring formation and the deletion of both genes together results in cell division defects ( Wright et al . , 2008 ) . Based on AlphaFold structure predictions , yeast Bsp1 is a largely unstructured protein without any known domains . The N - terminal part of Bsp1 is proline - rich and therefore could potentially be bound by a diverse set of protein - protein interaction domains , e . g . SH3 domains , as well as by actin or profilin - bound actin ( He et al . , 2009 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ; Feliciano et al . , 2015 ; Bieling et al . , 2018 ) . We searched for short peptide motifs in the Bsp1 sequence and identified a region with two sequences that resembled WH2 domains , a F - and G - actin - binding domain family ( Paunola et al . , 2002 ; Barzik et al . , 2005 ; Co et al . , 2007 ; Breitspechter et al . , 2008 ; Breitspechter et al . , 2011 ; Carlier et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , we detected a putative CPI motif at the C - terminus of the protein . This motif shares similarities to CPI motifs of CARMILs and CKIPs , but differs from CPI motif of twinfilins ( Fig . 1A ) . The putative WH2 and CPI sequences together with the localization of Bsp1 actin structures suggest a role in actin regulation . To study the role of CPI motif and WH2 - like domains in the Bsp1 recruitment to actin structures , we GFP - tagged Bsp1 C - terminally at its endogenous gene locus ( Fig . 1A ) . We also designed three C - terminally GFP - tagged truncation mutants : Bsp1 1 - 556 , Bsp1 1 - 470 and Bsp1 1 - 407 ( Fig . 1A ) . We observed a heterogeneous expression level of Bsp1 across the cell 4 population that appeared to be independent of cell cycle state , which has not been reported for other actin patch proteins ( Fig . S1A ) . Full - length Bsp1 localized to endocytic patches and the contractile ring consistent with previous findings ( Fig . 1B ) ( Drees et al . , 2001 ; Wright et al . , 2008 ) . Occasionally , we observed in some cells a filamentous localization of Bsp1 reminiscent of actin cables ( Fig . S1B ) . Compared to full - length Bsp1 , all Bsp1 mutants showed a similar overall localization to actin patches and contractile rings . However , more detailed analysis revealed that compared to the full - length protein , both Bsp1 1 - 556 and Bsp1 1 - 470 were more enriched at actin patches ( fig . 1C ) . In contrast , the level of Bsp1 1 - 407 mutant at patches was significantly decreased ( fig . 1C ) . This suggests that the WH2 - like domain promotes Bsp1 recruitment to actin patches and that the C - terminal region , including the CPI motif , negatively regulates Bsp1 recruitment to actin patches . Alternatively , these Bsp1 recruitment phenotypes may reflect changes in the amount of actin at endocytic sites caused by the Bsp1 mutations . None of our mutants showed complete mislocalization , indicating that the proline - rich N - terminal part of the protein also has a role in the localization of Bsp1 . Bsp1 binds actin filaments and capping protein in vitro Bsp1 localizes to different actin filament populations in yeast cells . Bsp1 might interact directly with F - actin through its putative WH2 - like domains . To test this hypothesis , we purified untagged full length Bsp1 protein and tested its affinity to actin filaments with co - sedimentation assay . Using polymerized human platelet actin , we observed an increasing amount of Bsp1 protein in the pellet fraction after ultracentrifugation upon increased concentration of actin filament ( Figure 2A - B ) . These results indicate that full length Bsp1 binds directly to F - actin . 5 To test if the two putative WH2 domains facilitate the interaction of Bsp1 with actin filaments , we purified both a truncated Bsp1 1 - 407 lacking the two WH2 - like domains and the C - terminal , CPI motif , as well as the two WH2 - like domains conjugated with GST ( GST - Bsp1 408 - 470 ) . We observed strong interaction of full length Bsp1 and GST - Bsp1 408 - 470 with actin filaments , whereas Bsp1 1 - 407 did not interact with F - actin ( Figure 2C ) . Next we wanted to study if Bsp1 interacts directly with CP . To this end , we purified recombinant yeast CP and synthesized the CPI motif peptide of Bsp1 and labeled it with Cy5 . By measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of labeled CPI motif peptide , we observed a strong affinity of Bsp1 CPI motif peptide to CP with the dissociation constant K D being 45 nM ( Fig 2D ) . Compared to other known CPI motifs ( McConnell et al . 2020 ) , Bsp1 binds CP with affinity similar to CIN85 and CD2AP , whereas mammalian CARMILs bind to CP with much stronger affinity . Notably , mammalian twinfilin has much lower affinity to CP compared to Bsp1 ( Hakala et al . , 2018 ; McConnell et al . , 2020 ) , suggesting that these proteins have a different effect on capped F - actin barbed ends . In summary , our in vitro binding assays show that Bsp1 has a strong affinity to CP with its C - terminal CPI motif , and to F - actin through the two WH2 - like motifs . Bsp1 regulates actin patch composition To further investigate the role of Bsp1 in endocytic actin regulation , we analyzed the intensities of GFP - tagged Cap1 ( actin filament capping complex α subunit ) , Twf1 ( twinfilin ) , Sac6 ( fimbrin ) , Abp1 ( Actin - binding protein 1 ) and Arc18 ( Arp2 / 3 complex subunit ) at the actin patches . Unlike Bsp1 , these endogenously expressed proteins showed uniform expression levels across the population of cells ( fig . S2 ) . The peak intensities of Twf1 , Cap1 and Abp1 patches were significantly reduced ( 19 , 17 and 13 % , respectively ) in bsp1Δ cells compared to WT cells ( Fig . 3A ) . A reduced number of Cap1 molecules at endocytic sites in bsp1∆ cells suggests that Bsp1 either promotes actin filament capping or stabilizes CP at 6 filament barbed ends . The similarity of the Cap1 and Twf1 phenotypes could be explained by Cap1 - dependent recruitment of Twf1 ( Palmgren et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast , Sac6 - EGFP patch peak intensities were not significantly different between WT and bsp1Δ cells , suggesting that actin cross - linking is unaffected ( Fig . 3A ) . Strikingly , the average peak patch intensity of Arc18 - eGFP was increased by 17 % in bsp1Δ cells over WT ( Fig . 2A ) , suggesting that the endocytic actin network in bsp1Δ cells is more branched than in WT cells . Remarkably , a fluorescent phalloidin staining showed that the overall F - actin amount in endocytic patches was not altered in bsp1Δ compared to WT cells ( Fig . 3B ) . Taken together these results suggest that relative to WT , in bsp1∆ cells the endocytic patches have similar amounts of F - actin and cross - linkers , while Arp2 / 3 - branching is increased and the amount of CP , Twf1 and Abp1 is decreased . Actin network organization is likely tuned differently in the mutants with less capped and more branched filaments . These findings are consistent with either a pro - capping or F - actin cap stabilizing role for Bsp1 . In addition , Abp1 interacts with Cap1 , Sac6 and the Arp2 / 3 complex , but the amount of Abp1 in the actin patch was reduced in bsp1Δ cells , similar to Cap1 . This observation suggests that Abp1 recruitment follows CP , and not Arp2 / 3 or Sac6 . In addition , Bsp1 proline rich regions might indirectly regulate the Arp2 / 3 complex , through other actin binding proteins via SH3 domain - interaction network . ( Tong et al . , 2002 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ; Hummel and Kaksonen , 2023 ) . As actin network composition in bsp1Δ cells differs from WT , the actin - dependent growth of the endocytic invagination might be affected . We used the motility of Pan1 - EGFP , a coat associated protein , as a proxy for invagination growth ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The analysis of Pan1 motility showed that membrane invagination and vesicle formation are not affected by the deletion of Bsp1 ( Fig . 3C ) . Hence , Bsp1 - associated actin patch composition differences are mild enough so that endocytic invagination effects are not detectable . It is possible that actin regulation by Bsp1 becomes important for stress response or plays a role in balancing the competition for actin between cytokinetic and endocytic sites . 7 A deletion or mutation of the CPI motif protein Aim21 reduced Cap1 amounts at endocytic sites in previous studies similar to our Bsp1 mutants ( Farrell et al . , 2017 ; Lamb et al . , 2021 ) . In contrast , we found that Bsp1 loss decreased Abp1 numbers in actin patches , while the deletion of Aim21 increased Abp1 numbers in patches ( Shin et al . , 2018 ) . Hence , the two CPI motif proteins Bsp1 and Aim21 have distinct functions . Bsp1 co - localizes with the endocytic actin network while Aim21 is co - localized with the WASP module proteins at the base of the endocytic invagination ( Tonikian et al . 2009 ) . These differences in localization of Bsp1 and Aim21 may correlate with their unique activities related to CP . Twf1 , like Bsp1 , is a component of the actin module , but the localization of Twf1 is dependent on its CP interaction ( Palmgren et al . , 2001 ) . The CPI of Bsp1 is not necessary for its recruitment and may even hinder it . The distinct recruitment mechanisms suggest that these CPI proteins have different roles in CP regulation . Our data supports the idea that Bsp1 promotes barbed end capping by CP , whereas at least mammalian twinfilin - 1 was shown to uncap filament barbed ends ( Hakala et al . , 2021 ; Mwangangi et al . , 2021 ) . While yeast and mammalian twinfilins likely have conserved biochemical functions , we note that to date yeast Twf1 has not been shown to uncap filament barbed ends . Bsp1 recruits CP to the bud neck The actin patch at the endocytic sites is nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , while the cytokinetic contractile actin ring is nucleated by formins ( Pruyne et al . , 2004 ) . CK666 is an Arp2 / 3 inhibitor , which blocks actin patch formation in yeast without perturbing the contractile ring . A recent study found that Cap2 normally localizes to both the endocytic patches and the contractile ring , however , upon CK666 - treatment , Cap2 localizes only to the contractile ring ( Wirshing et al . , 2023 ) . We tested if the Bsp1 CPI motif could regulate recruitment of CP 8 to the contractile ring . In agreement with the previous study ( Wirshing et al . , 2023 ) , we observed Cap1 - eGFP localization both to endocytic patches and the contractile ring . However , the bud neck area is rich in endocytic events , which makes quantification of Cap1 ring localization difficult . CK666 - treatment made ring formation of Cap1 - EGFP more apparent due to a strong reduction of Cap1 patches . Thus , we tested whether the Bsp1 CPI motif can regulate Cap1 recruitment to the bud neck in CK666 - treated cells . We counted the number of Cap1 - EGFP ring structures per field - of - view ( FOV ) . Compared to WT levels , the number of cells with Cap1 - EGFP localized to the cytokinetic ring was significantly decreased in both bsp1Δ cells and in bsp1 1 - 556 cells ( fig . 4A ) . Both Bsp1 - EGFP and Bsp1 1 - 556 - EGFP localized to the contractile ring in a similar manner ( Fig . 4B ) . This data shows that Bsp1 with its CPI motif is the major recruitment factor for CP and thus a key regulator of actin filament capping at the yeast contractile ring . The CP localization defect was milder in bsp1 1 - 556 than in bsp1Δ , suggesting that Bsp1 may have several mechanisms of regulating CP recruitment . Moreover , CP recruitment to both endocytic sites and the contractile ring was reduced in bsp1Δ , suggesting increased levels of free , inactive cytoplasmic CP . We speculate that Bsp1 may have a CP - activating function analogous with mammalian CARMIL - like CPI motif proteins . Alternatively , as Bsp1 can bind actin in vitro ( fig . 2 ) , Bsp1 may stabilize barbed end - bound CP through simultaneous binding to both CP and actin filaments . Bsp1s are a CPI motif protein family of dikarya fungi We examined the Bsp1 amino acid sequence in respect to other orthologs and known CPI motif proteins . With step - wise and reciprocal BLAST searches we were able to identify orthologs in most dikarya , a fungal clade that contains over 90 % of known fungal species . We found three distinct groups of Bsp1 orthologs ( fig . 5A ) . The orthologs in the first group , 9 which we term Group I , have an N - terminus that resembles budding yeast Bsp1 in organization , but have up to three additional C - terminal ADF / gelsolin domains after the CPI motif . Both dikarya subgroups , the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes , contain Group I orthologs , which likely represent an ancestral Bsp1 organization . The second group is found in Saccharomycotina subphylum , which includes S . cerevisiae Bsp1 . Group II proteins lack the ADF / gelsolin domains and terminate with a CPI motif . The WH2 domains were only detected in some Group II orthologs . The third group comprises proteins found in Ustilaginomycotina subphylum . These Bsp1 orthologues fused with the Ade8 gene , a purine biosynthesis enzyme . Ade8 ( a GART domain ) , is inserted in the center of Group III Bsp1s and appears to have replaced the CPI motif ( fig . 5A ) . This may hint at a unique feedback between ADP / ATP synthesis and actin , a major consumer of ATP . Many fungal Bsp1 proteins have been annotated as villin / gelsolin proteins due to the presence of C - terminal ADF / gelsolin domains . Canonical villins occur in diverse species including plants , amoeba and animals and contain several ADF / Gelsolin domains in succession , followed by a C - terminal villin headpiece domain ( George et al . , 2020 ; Huang et al . , 2014 ) . Proteins with this organization were not detected in dikarya species ( fig . 5A ) . Gelsolins resemble villin ADF / gelsolin domain organization , but lack a headpiece and appear restricted to muscle - containing animal species ( fig . 5A ) . A gelsolin - like protein occurs with villin in the fungal group Chytridiomycota , but it is unclear if this is a novel fungal convergence , a Bsp1 variant or has another origin ( Fig . 5A ) . A connection between true villins / gelsolins and Bsp1s remains unclear , given their few ADF / Gelsolin domains , lack of a villin headpiece and CPI motif . We sought to identify if Bsp1s were evolutionarily related to other CPI motif proteins . The CPI motif proteins Cin85 / CD2AP , CKIP , and CapZIP were only detected in holozoans , while CARMILs and Fam21 proteins appeared more ancient ( fig . 5A ) . Canonical CARMIL proteins contain an N - terminal PH domain , LLR domains and a CPI motif , however the PH domain 10 has been lost in several lineages . Fungi were not found to contain CARMIL orthologs , however the holomycotan Fonticula alba contained a CARMIL that had uniquely added C - terminal ADF / gelsolin domains . The unstructured Fam21 proteins are a subunit of the actin regulatory WASH complex , which was lost in fungi ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) , and accordingly , Fam21 proteins were not identified in fungi ( fig . 5A ) . CPI motifs are classified based on the protein , so we generated a fungal Bsp1 consensus sequence based on 33 orthologs to compare to the Bsp1 family CPI motif ( fig . 5B and Supplemental Text ) . The Bsp1 consensus CPI motif was compared against CPI motifs in CARMIL1 , CARMIL2 , CARMIL3 , CIN85 , CD2AP , CapZIP , Fam21 and CKIP proteins ( fig . 1A ) ( McConnel et al . , 2020 ) . Our sequence analysis revealed that the CPI motif of Bsp1 is closest to those of CKIP and Fam21 , which points to a pro - capping function of Bsp1 . Taken together these data support three possible origins for Bsp1 proteins : ( 1 ) a novel innovation of a fungal CPI motif , ( 2 ) a CARMIL divergence that may share an ancestry with the F . alba CARMIL tail , or ( 3 ) a repurposing of Fam21 after loss of the WASH complex . The actin capping regulation machinery of S . cerevisiae , appears to have diverged significantly from animals and includes : Tda2 , ascomycete - specific Aim21 , saccharomycotina - specific Aim3 and dikarya - specific Bsp1 proteins ( Figure 5A ) ( Michelot et al . , 2013 ; Shin et al . , 2018 ; Lamb et al . , 2021 ) . The innovation of Aim3 , an actin capping protein , correlates with loss of ADF / Gelsolin domains in Group II Bsp1s ( Figure 5A ) and may be functionally connected , however gelsolins and Aim3 capping functions are mechanistically different ( Michelot et al . , 2013 ; Nag et al . , 2013 ) . CP regulation has diverged significantly , while numerous other proteins that regulate actin dynamics are tightly constrained such as profilin , cofilin , Aip1 , twinfilin , CAP / Srv2 , coronins , the Arp2 / 3 complex , formins and tropomyosins . What allows for a large plasticity and specialization in the capping regulation across species and how it relates to the diverse actin functions remains unknown . Bsp1 represents a fungal variation of a pro - capping factor analogous to mammalian CPI motif proteins , which may adapt the actin cytoskeleton to fungal cell biology . 11 Author contributions C .

For Bsp1 orthologs , which have low sequence orthology , reciprocal BLAST searches were done first within Saccharomycotina to identify several diverse orthologs , which were used to identify out Ascomycotina orthologs and then expanded out to other clades . The Bsp1 CPI motif consensus site was generated with Jalview . Plasmids and protein purification A BSP1 gene was cloned to pCoofy3 vector ( a gift from Sabina Suppmann ; Addgene plasmid 43983 ) as described previously ( Scholz et al . , 2013 ) .

These fragments were annealed to the pCoogy3 vector as described above . Bsp1 proteins were expressed overnight at 20°C in BL21 pLysS Gold competent cells ( Agilent ) using autoinduction LB medium ( Formedium ) . Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 supplemented with PMSF and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) by sonication . GST - tagged proteins were bound to glutathione sepharose 4B resin ( Cytiva ) and subsequently washed several times with the lysis buffer . Full length Bsp1 and Bsp1 1 - 407 were cleaved from the GST tag with PreScission protease whereas GST - Bsp1408 - 470 was eluted from the resin using 30 mM glutatione in the lysis buffer without Triton X - 100 . All proteins were then cleaned with Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris - HCl , 500 mM NaCl . 2 mM DTT , 2 mM EDTA . Proteins were concentrated and stored with 10 % glycerol at - 80°C . Yeast capping protein plasmid for recombinant protein expression in E . coli , pRSFDuet1 - 6xHis - Cap1 / Cap2 ( Alphée Michelot , IBDM ) . Capping protein was expressed and purified as described previously ( Antkowiak et al . , 2019 ) . After overexpressing the protein in BL21 pLysS cells in autoinduction LB medium , cells we lysed in 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 20 mM Imidazole , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol buffer supplemented with PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail by sonication . Capping protein was then bound to HisTrap Fast Flow column ( Cytiva ) and eluted with a gradient of 20 - 300mM imidazole . The final product was cleaned with Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 10 % glycerol and protein was stored in 50 % glycerol at - 80°C . 15 Actin filament cosedimentation assay Human platelet actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was polymerized in F - actin buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP ) for two hours in room temperature . An indicated concentration of polymerized actin was mixed with 2 µM final concentration of Bsp1 proteins in the F - actin buffer and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature . Actin filaments were then spinned down with Beckmann TL - 100 ultracentrifuge using TLA 100 . 1 rotor at 75 , 000 rpm for 30 minutes . Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant were loaded on SDS - PAGE gels . Amounts of Bsp1 protein in pellets and supernatants were measured with Fiji and final graphs were generated using Prism 9 ( Graphpad ) . Fluorescence anisotropy FITC - labeled Bsp1 CPI motif peptide ( FITC - RDETVKETKPLVHPNKNRTRGPRRKLPTRV ) was synthesized at Genscript . Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl buffer . 100 nM of FITC - labeled CPI motif peptide and varying concentration of yeast capping protein were incubated for 15 minutes in room temperature before the fluorescence anisotropy was measured with ClarioStar plate reader ( BMG labtech ) . Anisotropy values were calculated with MARS data analysis software ( BMG labtech ) . Final graph was generated with Prism 9 ( Graphpad ) . Data was fitted using the one - site binding equation : 𝑦 = 𝐵𝑚𝑎𝑥 * 𝑥 / ( 𝐾𝑑 + 𝑥 ) where Bmax is the binding maximum , Kd is the dissociation constant and x is the ligand concentration . 16 References Amatruda JF , Gattermeir DJ , Karpova TS , Cooper JA . 1992 .
