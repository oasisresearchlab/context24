Instead , the vast majority of studies concerning Rho GTPases has focused on the three classical members RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 . In contrast , RhoD is considered an atypical Rho GTPase , with an aberrant GTP / GDP cycling and an unknown regulation . Like most Rho GTPases , altered RhoD protein levels result in actin cytoskeleton reorganization . We found that increased RhoD protein levels lead to a less dynamic actin cytoskeleton , while RhoD silencing leads to more pronounced actin - containing structures , such as stress fibers , cortical actin and ruffles , depending on cell type . Actin - dependent processes , such as cell migration and cell proliferation , are significantly affected in absence of RhoD in fibroblasts . Moreover , we have shown that endogenous RhoD , as well as its interaction partner WHAMM , localize to the Golgi apparatus . Silencing or overexpression of RhoD or WHAMM leads to a dispersion of the Golgi apparatus , suggesting a role of these proteins in Golgi homeostasis . In addition , protein transport from the ER to the plasma membrane is delayed both when overexpressing and silencing RhoD and WHAMM , as measured by the VSV - G protein transport assay . One of the first described functions of RhoD was its regulatory role in endosome fusion and trafficking . We found that the localization to vesicles is independent of the nucleotide - bound status of RhoD . However , only the GTP - bound RhoD can localize to the plasma membrane . In contrast , RhoD must be inactivated for fusion of RhoD positive vesicles . Deleting the unique N - terminal of RhoD leads to an altered distribution and characteristics of RhoD positive vesicles . Taken together , this thesis elucidates the role of RhoD in three different dynamic cellular processes ; reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , Golgi homeostasis and vesicle transport and fusion .

INTRODUCTION This thesis aims to present data to elucidate the role of RhoD as a regulator of dynamic cellular processes . Being a member of the Rho GTPases , it is not surprising that RhoD exert a regulatory role on the actin cytoskeleton . However , this thesis also presents data to illuminate RhoD in its role as a regulator of vesicle dynamics and Golgi homeostasis . 1 . Rho GTPases 1 . 1 The Rho GTPase family Nature has developed a variety of ways to regulate the activity of cellular proteins . One common strategy is phosphorylation , often leading to activation of a protein . Other examples are ubiquitination , regulation by expression / degradation or confining the subcellular localization of a protein . The small GTPases , constituting around 150 protein members in mammals [ 1 ] , are activated when binding a guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) . As the GTP is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) , the protein becomes inactivated . This is the reason why small GTPases are considered “molecular switches” . The binding and hydrolysis of the nucleotide is in turn tightly controlled , leading to an intricate regulatory system . [ 1 ] Small GTPases can be further subdivided , depending on structural and functional similarities , into six subfamilies ( Tab 1 ) [ 1 ] . Small GTPase subfamily Nr of genes in human Function Rab 63 Vesicle transport Ras 36 Cell proliferation , differentiation , survival Arf 27 Vesicle transport Rho 20 Actin cytoskeleton organization Ran 1 Transport of RNA and proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm Other , including Miro 9 Mitochondrial transport etc . Table 1 . The functions of the different small GTPase subfamilies . 2 The Rho family contains 20 members , known to regulate different aspects of actin cytoskeleton dynamics ( Fig 1 ) . The first Rho GTPases were found in 1985 as genes related to the already known Ras subfamily [ 2 ] . Out of the 20 Rho family members , only three of them have been studied in detail , RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 . These three proteins have therefore been seen as the model for a bona fide Rho GTPase . Thus , Rho proteins possessing the characteristics of RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 and their isoforms are termed “classical Rho GTPases” , while the remaining have been referred to as “atypical Rho GTPases” . The dividing point between the two classes is the functionality of the GTP / GDP cycling [ 3 ] . To date , half of the Rho GTPases are considered atypical , which raises the question if they are really that atypical after all . The classical Rho GTPases have a slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and slow nucleotide exchange and requires additional regulatory proteins for the GTP / GDP cycling . Figure 1 . The Rho GTPase family tree based on similarity of the GTPase domain . The atypical Rho GTPases have altered cycling properties , either aberrant ability to hydrolyze GTP or fast nucleotide exchange ability ( tab 2 ) . Rho BTB1 and 2 deviate even more among the Rho GTPases , as they have additional domains and therefore are more than three times the size of other Rho GTPases . Atypical Rho GTPases RhoA RhoC RhoB Rnd3 Rnd1 Rnd2 RhoD Rif RhoH RhoBTB2 RhoBTB1 TCL TC10 RhoG Rac2 Rac3 Rac1 Wrch1 Chp Cdc42 3 All Rho GTPases , except Rho BTB1 and 2 , have a molecular weight of around 20 kilo Dalton ( kDa ) [ 4 ] . They contain a GTP binding domain that interacts with the guanosine nucleotide , containing the switch1 and 2 motifs ( Fig 2 ) [ 5 ] . Switch 1 and 2 are regions that , when interacting with the γ - phosphate , alter their conformations . In the GTP - bound state , the Rho GTPase can interact with its effector proteins and induce downstream signaling . When GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP , the γ - phosphate is lost and switch 1 and 2 folds back to a relaxed conformation so that the interactions to the effector proteins are lost [ 6 ] . Table 2 .

Atypical Rho GTPase Intrinsic GTP / GDP cycling Consequence Chp No data regarding intrinsic GTP / GDP cycling but structurally related to Wrch1 [ 3 ] Possibly highly active Wrch1 Fast nucleotide exchange [ 7 , 8 ] Highly active RhoH No GTP hydrolysis [ 9 ] Constitutively active RhoBTB1 , RhoBTB2 Alternative amino acid in conserved region needed for GTP hydrolysis . RhoBTB2 may not bind nucleotide . [ 10 , 11 ] Not dependent upon activation by GTP binding ? Rnd1 , 3 No GTPase hydrolysis , low GDP affinity [ 12 , 13 ] Constitutively active Rnd2 Alternative amino acid in conserved region needed for GTP hydrolysis [ 12 ] Theoretical constitutively active RhoD , Rif Fast nucleotide exchange ( low GDP affinity ) [ 14 ] Highly active 4 Most Rho GTPases ( as well as many other small GTPases ) have a C - terminal CAAX - motif , where C stands for cysteine , A for aliphatic amino acids and X for variable amino acid . The motif is often post - translationally prenylated , in which a geranylgeranyl or a farnesyl lipid group is added to the protein . All Rho GTPases are localized to the plasma membrane and / or to an intracellular membrane [ 15 ] , but they do not harbor any transmembrane domains . The modified CAAX - motif enables the protein to be inserted into a hydrophobic membrane and inhibition of this modification disturbs the localization and function of the protein [ 16 ] . The Rho GTPases are set apart from other small GTPases by the presence of the Rho insert region ( Fig 2 ) [ 17 ] . Figure 2 . General structure of a Rho GTPase . 1 . 2 Regulation of the Rho GTPases Similar to small GTPases in other Ras subfamilies , the intrinsic hydrolysis of GTP to GDP , and the dissociation of GDP for a GTP are very slow [ 18 ] . Another set of proteins therefore stimulate these processes , thereby acting as regulatory proteins . There are three main groups of regulatory proteins , GEFs , GAPs and GDIs ( Fig 3 ) . Rho GTPase activator GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) GEFs act by facilitating dissociation of GDP so that a new GTP can bind , thereby functioning as an activator . There are two families of GEFs , one with a Dbl - homology domain ( DH ) and one with a Dock Homology Region ( DHR ) ( Fig 4 ) . The first such mammalian protein , discovered in 1985 , was Dbl ( diffuse B cell lymphoma ) [ 19 , 20 ] . Since then , around 70 members of this group have been found in humans [ 21 ] . A Rho GTPase is unstable when not binding a nucleotide . However , when interacting with a GEF , such as the DH domain in a Dbl protein , a stable Rho GTPase : GEF intermediate lacking nucleotide is possible . An excess of GTP over GDP in the cell will favor new binding of GTP to the GTPase [ 22 ] . Apart from a DH domain , almost all Dbl - family proteins contain pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains . This domain interacts with phosphoinositides and localizes the proteins to the plasma membrane . 5 Figure 3 . Regulation of the the classical Rho GTPases . Adapted from [ 23 ] . The Dbl proteins display a diverse range of additional domains , giving them ability to activate Rho GTPases in a localization - specific manner . Dbl proteins are themselves regulated e . g . by autoinhibition by its N - terminal . Cleavage of the N - terminal has been shown to result in constitutively active proteins of several DH domain - containing GEFs [ 24 , 25 ] . A guanosine nucleotide binds to its GTPase with high affinity . It has been shown for Ras that the GEF Cdc25 acts by binding the GDP - bound small GTPase with low affinity , which leads to weakening of the GTPase - GDP interaction and strengthening of the GTPase : GEF interaction as the GDP dissociates . Binding of a new GTP will then displace the GEF from the GTPase , which becomes active [ 18 , 26 ] . Figure 4 . Protein structures of the Rho GEFs Dbl and Dock . Adapted from [ 27 ] . Binding to membrane Binding to membrane Binding to Rac / Cdc42 Binding to Rho GTPase Dock family Dbl family 6 The second family of RhoD GEFs is the Dock family proteins , harboring a DHR2 domain which interacts with the GTPase . Although the mechanism to catalyze nucleotide exchange is similar between the DHR2 and DH domains , their amino acid sequences are unrelated . In addition , the Dock proteins have an upstream DHR1 domain , which , in analogy to PH domains , localizes the protein to the plasma membrane ( Fig 4 ) . Autoinhibition has been reported also for Dock GEFs [ 28 , 29 ] . Whereas the Dbl - family GEFs activate many different Rho GTPases , the Dock GEFs are restricted to the Rac and Cdc42 families [ 27 ] . Rho GTPase repressor GAP ( GTPase activating protein ) A GAP catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP by stabilizing the GTPase in a conformation which helps a water molecule to hydrolyze the GTP to a GDP . The importance of regulation by GAPs in vivo is evident considering the abundance of mutations in the small GTPase Ras found in tumor samples . The mutations mainly lead to an altered amino acid at one of three positions in Ras ; at position 12 , 13 or 61 . All three mutations result in a Ras protein in which the hydrolysis of the GTP by GAP is abolished , giving a constitutively active Ras - oncogene [ 30 ] . The regulations of the GAPs are not as clear as for the GEFs , but the RhoGAP β2 - chimerin has been found to be autoinhibited [ 31 ] . Considering the fact that the activity of some GEFs and GAPs is not restricted only to one Rho GTPase , it is surprising that these regulatory proteins outnumber the Rho GTPases [ 18 ] . Rho GTPase inhibitor GDI ( guanosine dissociation inhibitor ) The GDI adds another type of regulation ; by binding and sequestering the Rho GTPase away from its site of action at the membrane ( Fig 3 ) . Compared to the GEFs and GAPs , the GDI protein family is very small and contains only three known members . Most Rho GTPases have C - termini that are prenylated after translation and a majority is geranylgeranylated [ 15 ] . The added lipid enables the Rho GTPase to be associated with membranes where it can be activated by GEFs and exert its action . GDIs bind to the geranylgeranyl lipid of the C - terminal Rho GTPase , and in so doing , extracting it from the membrane where the Rho GTPase was inserted . In this way , Rho GTPases are held as soluble inactive complexes in the cytosol . Some Rho GTPases are instead farnesylated , making them inert to GDIs [ 15 ] . Phosphorylation of GDI is known to decrease the interaction to the Rho GTPase , whereas phosphorylation of the Rho GTPase conversely leads to an increased interaction to the GDI [ 32 ] . 7 PDEδ The PDEδ protein binds preferably farnesylated proteins , but also geranylgeranylated , [ 33 ] and it has been shown to interact and extract farnesylated Rab13 and several Ras GTPases from membranes [ 34 , 35 ] . PDEδ and GDIs work in a similar manner , by binding and capturing the prenylated group into a β - sandwich domain [ 36 ] . In contrast to GDIs , the PDEδ does not have a GTPase binding motif , explaining why it can interact with GTPase - unrelated proteins [ 33 ] . Additional regulation In addition to the classical regulation by GEFs , GAPs and GDIs , Rho GTPases can be regulated by a number of post - translational modifications . The already mentioned lipid modification of the C - terminal regulates the subcellular localization [ 15 ] . The most common lipidation on Rho GTPases are geranylgeranylation ( addition of a 20 - carbon chain moiety ) and farnesylation ( addition of a 15 - carbon chain moiety ) , both irreversible modifications . In addition , several Rho GTPases can undergo palmitoylation [ 37 - 39 ] . This process is reversible and , like prenylation , the palmitoylation enables the protein to be inserted into a membrane [ 40 ] . The prenylation and palmitoylation can occur on the same protein [ 39 , 41 ] . Phosphorylation of Rho GTPases can cause a hampered intrinsic GTP / GDP cycling [ 42 - 44 ] . It can also interfere with the interactions to regulatory proteins or effector proteins . Addition of a ubiquitin moiety is a common way to mark a protein for degradation or targeting it to other subcellular compartments . One example is the ubiquitination of RhoA at the leading edge of a migrating cell , which inhibits the formation of stress fibers and enables the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia [ 45 ] . Rac1 can both undergo ubiquitination and sumoylation . Sumoylation of Rac1 leads to increased GTP - binding and has been shown to be important for optimal lamellipodia formation and cell migration after stimulation of hepatocyte growth factor [ 46 ] . Moreover , regulation of Rho GTPases occur at the level of transcription [ 47 ] and by the activity of microRNAs [ 48 ] . 1 . 3 Rho effector proteins As previously mentioned , Rho GTPases predominantly interact with their effector proteins when in a GTP - bound state . Mutations within the switch regions have revealed that different effector proteins bind to different amino acids within the switch regions . This means that a point mutation can abolish binding to one interaction partner , but leave the interaction to 8 another partner intact [ 49 ] . There are some domains that effector proteins which bind to Rho proteins share . One is the CRIB domain ( Cdc42 / Rac - interactive binding motif ) , which is present in many of the Cdc42 and Rac binding proteins . However , the CRIB domain itself is not sufficient to bind Cdc42 or Rac . Likewise , an REM , ( Rho effector homology motif ) , has been found in several RhoA effectors [ 49 ] . One way Rho GTPases activate their effector proteins is by breaking an autoinhibitory intramolecular structure to expose functional domains [ 50 , 51 ] . 1 . 4 The Rho GTPase RhoD One subgroup of the Rho GTPase family includes RhoD and Rif ( Rho in filopodia ) ( Fig 1 ) . Whereas Rif has a more tissue specific expression pattern , RhoD is expressed in most tissues , with high levels in kidney , liver , intestine and lung [ 52 ] . RhoD evolved late and is the only Rho GTPase expressed exclusively in mammals [ 53 ] . Since both RhoD and Rif have a functional GTP hydrolysis capacity , they were first considered to belong to the classical Rho GTPases . However , the finding that RhoD and Rif are capable to be activated without a GEF led to a reclassification to the atypical cohort . The binding of GDP to RhoD is more than 15 times weaker than to most Rho GTPases , suggesting that RhoD can be activated in absence of a GEF activator . The intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity of RhoD is increased in a way similar to that of Rac1b [ 14 ] , a splice variant of Rac1 upregulated in breast and colorectal cancer [ 54 , 55 ] . To date , RhoD has not been found upregulated or mutated in tumor samples . Just as for most Rho GTPases , mutants disturbing the activity of RhoD have been used to examine the role of the protein . Mutation of the glycine at position 26 ( corresponding to position 12 in Rac1 ) gives a hydrolysis - defective RhoD , which is constitutively active . Mutation of the threonine at position 31 ( corresponding to position 17 in Rac ) leads to a dominant negative mutant . 9 2 . Actin Together with the microtubule network and the intermediate filaments , the actin filaments give stability and dynamics to the cytoskeleton of the eukaryotic cell . Cells need to alter the morphology in order to adapt to the environment , to migrate and divide . This is possible due to a dynamic actin cytoskeleton , which can be rearranged into many supramolecular structures . 2 . 1 Polymerization and depolymerization The basic building block of all actin - containing structures is the actin monomer . This polypeptide of 42 kDa is called G - actin for globular actin and can polymerize into filamentous actin , F - actin . The actin monomer binds an adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) molecule in its nucleotide - binding cleft , which can be hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) . The binding of either nucleotide affects the conformation and thereby the properties of actin . The ATP - bound actin can more easily be incorporated into actin filaments , but is shortly after hydrolyzed to ADP . ADP - actin is prone to dissociate from the polymer , leading to depolymerization of the filament . ADP - bound G - actin can then exchange its ADP for ATP and be used again for insertion into F - actin ( Fig 5 ) . Figure 5 . ATP - dependent actin polymerization . Actin filaments have polarity , since the monomers orient the nucleotide - bounding cleft in the same direction . This direction is called minus or pointed end and contains GDP - bound actin . The polymerization takes place in the plus end , also called the barbed end , and contains mostly GTP - bound actin . Treadmilling describes the process in which an actin filament is polymerizing at the barbed end and , at the same time , depolymerizing at the pointed end . This 10 process is seen at the leading edge of a migrating cell , forcing the cell to move forward , ( Fig 6 ) [ 56 ] . The concentration of actin monomers in a non - muscular cell is 8 - 250 µM [ 57 ] . This is much above the critical concentration in vitro for actin polymerization , which is 0 . 1 µM for ATP - bound actin and 5 µM for ADP - actin [ 58 ] . It has been shown that most G - actin in the Xenopus egg cell is ATP - bound , ready to be incorporated into F - actin [ 57 ] . The reason why a high concentration of ATP - bound G - actin is not instantly inserted into actin filaments is due to several regulatory mechanisms . To avoid spontaneous actin polymerization , free actin monomers are sequestered by proteins such as thymosin  4 [ 59 ] . This protein binds with high affinity to ATP - actin and thereby prevents polymerization of actin monomers [ 60 ] . The first actin sequestering protein identified was profilin , which hides the actin - actin binding site [ 61 ] . In fact , most cellular G - actin monomers are associated with profilin in Acanthamoeba [ 62 ] . This protein is , however , not only a negative regulator of actin polymerization , but contributes to a controlled polymerization mechanism . It facilitates ADP / ATP exchange of the G - actin monomer and binds to formins , thereby bringing polymerizable actin monomers to the growing end [ 61 , 63 ] . Formation of actin polymers are limited by the nucleation , i . e . formation of actin trimers ( the “nucleus” ) . This is a non - favorable process and is catalyzed by actin nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) . Once a trimer is formed , the actin can elongate more rapidly [ 64 ] . Two important groups of actin NPFs are the WASP / WAVE proteins and the formins . WASP / WAVE proteins contain a VCA domain which can bind and alter the conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 65 ] . The conformational change leads to the activation of this seven protein - complex , in which the proteins Arp2 and Arp3 are structurally related to actin ( 30 - 50 % sequence similarity ) [ 66 ] . Binding to an actin filament , the Arp2 / 3 induces actin polymerization at an angle of 70 ° from the mother filament [ 67 ] . In this way , a branched actin network can be formed ( Fig 6 ) [ 68 ] . Formins are multidomain NPFs that instead promote linear actin polymerization . Many formins have a C - terminal FH1 domain which interacts with profilin . In this way , profilin - bound actin monomers are recruited to the formin for polymerization . The FH2 domain shields the growing actin polymer end from capping proteins . The Diaphanous - related formins ( DRFs ) have a GTPase binding domain in the N - terminal , and interaction with Rho GTPases is one way in which the formins is activated [ 69 , 70 ] . 11 There are several proteins that control the degradation of the actin filaments . The actin - depolymerization factor family ADF / cofilin has three members in mammals ; ADF , cofilin - 1 and cofilin - 2 . These proteins sever the actin filaments leading to fragmentation or depolymerization to actin monomers . The binding of ADF / cofilin to ADP - actin is stronger than to ATP - actin , resulting in severing of “older” actin filaments . The actin monomers generated after depolymerization can be reused and incorporated in new actin filaments and longer fragments can function as nuclei to generate new actin polymerization sites [ 71 ] . Another negative regulating system is provided by capping proteins ( CP ) , which bind to the actin barbed end with high affinity . This binding prevents further elongation as there is no longer access to the end monomer [ 72 ] . The formins and the actin elongation factors Ena / VASP in turn prevent binding of CP to the growing actin end , thus favoring polymerization [ 69 , 73 ] Gelsolin proteins bind to F - actin and kink the filament before breaking it in two . This protein is an efficient actin severing protein and remains attached to the filament after the breakage . In this way , it also acts as capping protein and prevents reannealing and polymerization from the new actin fragments [ 74 ] . Figure 6 .

The simplest structure is formed when G - actin monomers bind to one another forming an actin filament , which has a right - handed helical structure ( Fig 6A ) . When several filaments are packed together with the help of cross - linking proteins , they form an actin bundle . Since the filaments are polar , with one plus and one minus end , the bundles can either be parallel or anti - parallel ( Fig 7 ) . Parallel bundles containing around 15 filaments are found in filopodia [ 75 ] . Filopodia are dynamic fingerlike protrusions at the front of the cell ( Fig 8 ) . Its task is to sense the environment and to initiate contacts to the substratum or to the neighboring cells [ 76 ] . Filopodia are seen in a range of different cell types , but is an abundant structure in neuronal dendrites [ 77 ] . One possible mechanism by which filopodia could be formed is the association of a protein complex containing Ena / VASP with a set of actin filaments . Ena / VASP functions as actin elongation factors and so the filaments can grow and form a parallel actin bundle which is crosslinked by a crosslinking protein , often fascin [ 78 ] . There are several Rho GTPases shown to induce filopodia , such as Cdc42 , TC10 , Rnd3 , Rif and RhoD [ 79 - 83 ] although not via the same pathway [ 84 ] . Figure 7 . Crosslinked actin bundles in A ) filopodia and B ) stress fibers . fascin α - actinin Stress fibers filopodia B A 13 Bundles , with typically 10 - 30 anti - parallel actin filaments containing myosin II are called contractile fibers [ 85 ] . They are absent in filopodia and lamellipodia , but present in the rest of the cell . There are two types of contractile fibers ; ventral stress fibers and transverse arcs . Ventral stress fibers run in the same direction as the cellular movement and are adhering to focal contacts . In contrast , transverse arcs run parallel to the leading edge , but are not anchored to focal contacts . There is also a third class of stress fibers called dorsal stress fibers , however they are not contractile ( Fig 8 ) [ 86 ] . When actin filaments are elongated in a branched way , an actin network is formed . This actin structure is especially pronounced in the lamellipodium , the sheet - like membrane protrusion seen in the leading edge of a migrating cell ( Fig 8 ) [ 87 ] . Rac1 activates the Arp2 / 3 complex at the plasma membrane to catalyze branched polymerization , which pushes the plasma membrane forward and creates cellular movement [ 88 ] . The lamellipodia is a highly dynamic structure that is constantly projecting and retracting . By means of integrins , the actin can be anchored to a substratum , which is required for a forward cellular migration and not just a retrograde flow of actin [ 89 ] . However , for efficient pushing against the membrane border , not only branched actin polymerization is required , but elongation of the branched filaments . This is facilitated by Ena / VASP elongation factors , which hinders capping proteins to bind , thus preventing stalled polymerization [ 90 ] . The balance between actin polymerization by Arp2 / 3 and formins determines formation of lamellipodia or filopodia . Silencing of CP has been shown to result in lamellipodia formation ( although with less efficiency ) rather than filopodia [ 91 ] . Ena / VASP proteins also recruit profilin - bound ATP - actin , which accelerates the filament elongation [ 92 ] . Examples of negative regulators that break down lamellipodia are GMFs ( glial maturation factors ) , which sever branched actin filaments [ 93 ] and coronins , which inhibit the Arp2 / 3 activity [ 94 ] . Apart from in lamellipodia , branched actin polymerization is seen at the site of clathrin mediated endocytosis and mixed with linear actin filaments at the cellular cortex , called cortical actin [ 95 , 96 ] . A peripheral ruffle has a structure similar to the lamellipodium ; a sheet - like membrane protrusion , however , if the attachments at the leading edge are lost , the protrusions will fall back and form ruffles [ 78 ] . In fibroblasts , ruffles at the leading edge are , just as the lamellipodia , dependent upon Arp2 / 3 activation [ 97 ] . RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling all contribute to the formation of ruffles at the leading edge [ 98 ] . 14 Figure 8 . Cellular actin structures . 2 . 3 Actin myosin contraction The contractile stress fibers in non - muscle cells are composed of anti - parallel actin filaments , myosin - II and cross - linking proteins ( Fig 7B ) . Myosin - II has a globular domain ( “head” ) , with interaction sites for actin and ATP in the N - terminal , while the C - terminal contains domains essential for homodimer formation [ 99 ] . When a myosin head binds ATP , it detaches from actin . Subsequent hydrolysis of ATP to ADP releases energy required for a conformational change of the myosin head . In this state , the myosin head can bind to actin , and once bound , it will fall back again , pulling the actin filament with it ( called the “power stroke” ) . ADP is released and a new ATP is bound , causing the myosin head to detach from actin and a new cycle can start [ 100 ] . This movement of myosin heads will result in actin filaments sliding relatively to one another , thus shortening the fiber . Actin - myosin contraction in fibroblasts has been shown to shorten stress fibers with up to 25 % [ 101 ] . 2 . 4 Focal adhesions Focal adhesions ( FA ) are large protein complexes which mediate a link to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . A cell must be able to adhere to a substratum in order to spread and to migrate . An important component in the FAs is the transmembrane protein integrin , which Filopodium Dorsal stress fiber Lamellipodium Transverse arcs Ventral stress fiber 15 interacts with the ECM in one end and an actin binding protein in the intracellular end ( Fig 9A ) [ 102 ] . In this way , actin - myosin contraction can exert traction force on the ECM [ 103 ] . Figure 9 . A ) Schematic figure of a focal adhesion . Adapted from [ 104 ] . B ) Focal adhesion ( green ) and F - actin ( red ) in non - transfected and RhoA transfected cell . Integrins are heterodimers composed of one α - and one  - subunit , and due to isoforms of both subunits , 24 heterodimers can be found in humans . Different heterodimers display different binding preferences to ECM proteins , e . g . laminin and collagen [ 105 ] . Over 50 proteins have been reported to be part of FAs , leading to a complex structure which can be Non - transfected cell RhoA transfected cell Integrin dimer Extra cellular matrix Actin filaments B A 16 regulated in a variety of ways [ 106 ] . FAs are highly dynamic structures , which is a prerequisite for a migrating cell where adhesions are constantly formed and dissolved [ 107 ] . The formation of FAs is stimulated by intracellular signals , such as activation of RhoA , leading to stress fiber formation and an increased size of FAs ( Fig 9B ) . [ 108 ] However , external stimuli can lead to a similar response . FAs work as mechanosensors , and mechanical stress exerted on a cell leads to cell signaling transduction though the integrins , resulting in stress fiber formation and larger FAs [ 109 ] . 2 . 5 RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 downstream pathways RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 are the most studied Rho GTPases . Their effects were initially described in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts as starvation of these cells leads to a very low background of organized F - actin fibers , making them optimal to use when studying actin dynamics . The original finding showed that RhoA is important for formation of stress fibers , Cdc42 for filopodia formation and Rac1 for lamellipodia formation . The downstream pathways of these three Rho GTPase archetypes have been studied thoroughly and are described in most simplified terms below . RhoA The ability of RhoA to regulate the actin cytoskeleton was found when RhoA G14V ( constitutively active variant ) was injected into Swiss fibroblasts , leading to stress fiber formation . In addition , stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid alone , or as a component in serum , induced similar stress fibers in starved cells . However , a simultaneous treatment with the RhoA inhibitor C3 transferase abolished stress fiber formation [ 110 ] . Binding of the active RhoA results in loss of the autoinhibited conformation of Rho associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) . This leads to a phosphorylation of the myosin light chain phosphatase ( MLCP ) and inactivation of its phosphatase activity , subsequently resulting in a prolonged phosphorylation and activation of MLC . In addition , ROCK can phosphorylate and activate MLC directly [ 111 ] . MLC acts as a regulatory subunit of the myosin II motor protein and controls its interaction with actin . An activated myosin II can exert its function on actin filaments leading to cellular contraction [ 112 ] . Moreover , ROCK activates LIM kinase , which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits cofilin , thereby preventing actin depolymerization in favor of polymerization [ 113 , 114 ] . RhoA interaction and activation of mDia1 stimulates formation of actin filaments , which are packed into stress fibers ( Fig 10 ) [ 115 ] . 17 Cdc42 Many Cdc42 - / - cell types or cells expressing Cdc42 dominant negative show restrained or abolished filopodia formation . However , fibroblasts derived from Cdc42 - null embryonic stem cells form normal filopodia , revealing that the importance of Cdc42 activity to form filopodia is cell type dependent [ 116 ] . Early work suggested that Cdc42 can activate both RhoA and Rac1 . Therefore , in order to see the pure effect of injected active Cdc42 ( Cdc42 G12V ) , the Swiss 3T3 cells were simultaneously injected with dominant negative Rac1 and treated with C3 transferase . This resulted in the formation of filopodia [ 117 ] . Several downstream targets have been shown to contribute to Cdc42 - induced filopodia . The interaction and activation of the mouse Diaphanous protein 2 ( mDia2 ) leads to stimulation of linear actin polymerization and has been shown to be required for Cdc42 - induced filopodia formation [ 118 ] . The insulin - receptor substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) is another Cdc42 target protein contributing to filopodia formation in two ways ; by assembling of actin filaments ( via N - WASP and Ena / VASP ) and by inducing membrane curvature ( Fig 10 ) [ 119 , 120 ] . Cdc42 also binds N - WASP directly , but this interaction is not required for filopodia formation [ 120 , 121 ] . Figure 10 . Signaling pathways of Cdc42 , RhoA and Rac1 leading to filopodia formation , stress fibers and lamellipodia , respectively . Rac1 The active Rac1 mutant G12V gave rise to membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation when first injected into Swiss 3T3 cells . In addition , the dominant negative Rac1 inhibited 18 membrane ruffling stimulated by PDGF [ 122 ] . The main contribution of Rac1 signaling leading to formation of lamellipodia is the activation of the Arp 2 / 3 via the WAVE complex to induce a cross - linked actin network ( Fig 10 ) [ 123 ] . 2 . 6 Actin - driven cellular processes There are innumerous processes in the cell , which are directly or indirectly dependent upon the actin cytoskeleton . Below are mentioned some major actin driven processes critical for proper cell function . Cell migration The procedure of cell migration can in many cell types be described as cyclic . ( 1 ) The cell must extend protrusions , filopodia and / or lamellipodia , in the direction of migration . ( 2 ) A protrusion that persists for a longer time can form mature FAs linking the protrusion to the substratum . ( 3 ) Contractility of actin - myosin filaments leads to a forward motion as ( 4 ) the FAs in the rear end dissolve and the newly formed in the front act as clutches . The cycle can then start over with new protrusions being formed [ 107 ] . All four steps in this cycle involve actin . As described above , the protrusions are dependent upon actin polymerization , contraction is possible due to myosin - dependent sliding of actin filaments , and the FAs are tightly coupled to the actin filaments . It is therefore fully understandable that an effect on the actin cytoskeleton will result in an altered cell migration , such as increased invasiveness , inability to move in a directed way and increased or decreased migratory speed [ 124 - 126 ] . Cell polarity Cell polarity is found in most differentiated cells , meaning an unequal distribution of organelles , proteins or molecules ( often regulatory ones ) . The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is to a high degree dependent upon the inherited polarity of the actin cytoskeleton and the microtubule network [ 127 ] . The myosin motor proteins move on actin filaments mainly towards the barbed ( growing ) end . This contributes to cell polarity , as these motor proteins ( especially myosin - V ) can transport cargos over a long cellular distance . Furthermore , cell polarity is dependent upon the diverse actin structures in the cell . An external signal , which activates Rho GTPases locally in the membrane , will lead to a site - specific actin polymerization . This is an important concept in cell migration , where the 19 leading edge forms lamellipodia induced by Rac1 , but the rear end forms stress fibers induced by RhoA [ 107 ] . Cytokinesis The cytokinesis at the end of mitosis is enabled by the contractile ring made up of actin and myosin II filaments . The anaphase spindle recruits a RhoGEF to the so called equatorial zone . This leads to activation of RhoA at this site and a subsequent assembly of the contractile ring in the cell cortex . As the myosin containing fibers contract , the dividing cell is constricted and can eventually be pinched off to form two daughter cells [ 128 ] . The constriction is not only regulated by contraction , but a simultaneous cofilin - dependent actin depolymerization of the ring [ 129 ] . 2 . 7 RhoD and actin Most Rho GTPases exert effects on the actin cytoskeleton dynamics when exogenously expressed , though in a variety of ways [ 130 , 131 ] . Overexpression of RhoD leads to stress fiber dissolution and filopodia formation [ 80 ] . A handful of RhoD binding partners have been described [ 132 ] , but the mechanisms leading to the two actin phenotypes are still not known . No published data supports RhoD to act via the same signaling pathway as Cdc42 to induce filopodia . However , RhoD interaction with mDia3C has been proposed to be responsible for protrusions formed after fibroblast growth factor stimulation in mouse mesenchymal cells [ 133 ] . Exogenous expression of RhoD leads to a similar phenotype in many cell types ( stress fiber dissolution and filopodia formation ) , while the actin phenotype resulting from RhoD silencing can vary depending on cell type . However , they all have in common more pronounced actin - containing structures , seen as increased amount of stress fibers , increased cortical actin and / or membrane ruffles . For example , silencing RhoD in HeLa cells leads to increased number of stress fibers and cortical actin ( after 48 hrs ) , and later on ruffles ( after 72 hrs ) ( Fig 11 ) . The RhoD - SAAX mutant , which cannot be post - translationally prenylated has an altered localization and strongly induces actin stress fibers [ 134 ] . RhoD silencing leads to an increased size and reorganization of FAs [ 80 , 134 ] whereas RhoD G26V expressing cells show decreased FA size [ 135 ] . 20 Figure 11 . Dominant actin phenotype when RhoD is silenced or exogenously expressed . 3 The Golgi apparatus 3 . 1 Structure of the Golgi apparatus The smallest functional unit of the Golgi apparatus ( GA ) is the cisterna , a flattened membrane disc . Cisternae are often found in layers , forming a Golgi stack , which usually contains three to five cisternae in the mammalian cell [ 136 ] . The cisternae can be functionally divided into four different classes , cis ( closest to ER ) , medial , and trans cisternae and the trans - Golgi - network ( from where the proteins exit Golgi ) . GRASP65 and 55 act as Golgi tethering factors holding the cisternae together in a stack , and co - silencing leads to disassembly of the whole stack [ 137 ] . GRASP65 and 55 form homo - oligomers that crosslink Golgi membranes from two different cisternae . In vertebrates , the stacks can be further organized into one Golgi ribbon localized at the centrosome . When forming the ribbon , GRASP65 and 55 together with golgins ( a second class of Golgi tethering factors ) facilitate a lateral membrane fusion to connect the stacks into one continuous ribbon ( Fig 12 ) [ 138 ] . Figure 12 . Stacked Golgi cisternae are fused to form a continuous Golgi ribbon .

However , the GA has additional functions in controlling mitotic entry , microtubule organization and in calcium homeostasis [ 139 - 142 ] . The GA acts as a sorting station for transmembrane and soluble proteins . After synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , proteins and lipids are transported to the GA . Many proteins and lipids are modified by a covalent addition of sugar molecules , a process which starts in the ER and is completed in the GA . Around 250 different glycosyltransferases are found in the mammalian GA , which add one sugar molecule to another [ 143 ] . As the protein or lipid travels through the Golgi , from the cis - , through the medial - and finally to the trans - Golgi , it is processed in a particular order , as the glycosyltransferases reside in specific compartments within the Golgi [ 143 ] . How the proteins and lipids are transported across the Golgi stack is still debated . Two models are proposed . ( 1 ) Cisternal maturation ; where the cargo is maintained within the cisterna , which matures as it travels across the stack . The Golgi enzymes are recycled by retrograde transportation of vesicles from “later” to “earlier” cisternae [ 144 ] . ( 2 ) The cargo is transported forward in the Golgi stack by anterograde trafficking [ 145 ] . Finally , the proteins and lipids bud from the Golgi and are transported to their final subcellular destination or are secreted . The purpose of glycosylation is numerous . It can contribute to a stable protein conformation [ 146 ] , regulate protein activity [ 147 ] or act as a transport sorting signal [ 148 ] . 3 . 3 Golgi homeostasis The Golgi apparatus is an organelle , which undergoes highly morphological changes during the cell cycle . The mammalian interphase GA is organized in a Golgi ribbon ( Fig 12 ) . It is believed that organization into stacks and ribbon render the function of the GA more efficient [ 149 ] . At cell division , the GA needs to be fragmented into tubular - and vesicular clusters , in order to form two new GA , one in each daughter cell [ 150 ] . In the G2 stage of the cell cycle , the Golgi ribbon is degraded into separate stacks . During prophase / prometaphase , the stacks undergo unstacking and vesiculation , leading to small vesicles and tubules , named Golgi “haze” . At telophase , the Golgi vesicles reassemble in each daughter cell , forming new stacks and finally a ribbon [ 151 ] . Inhibition of the Golgi 22 ribbon fragmentation will result in a G2 block , which is different from the block caused by DNA damage [ 140 ] . 3 . 4 Actin at the Golgi complex It is well known that the microtubule network plays a central role in Golgi morphology and function , a role that has been thoroughly studied [ 152 ] . To what extent the actin cytoskeleton influences the Golgi function is less known . When actin polymers are either stabilized , or destabilized by treatment of toxins , the Golgi apparatus becomes more compact . However , electron microscopy reveals important differences . When actin polymers are stabilized ( after Jasplakinolide treatment ) , the Golgi stacks are fragmented , while the cisternae remain flat . When actin polymers instead are depolymerized ( after Cytochalasin or Latrunculin treatment ) , large swelling of the cisternae is seen [ 153 ] . Several proteins associated with actin regulation and function are described to localize to and act at the Golgi , e . g . Rho GTPases ( Cdc42 , RhoA and TC10 [ 154 - 156 ] ) , actin motor proteins ( myosin II , myosin VI [ 157 , 158 ] ) and the actin polymerization regulator Arp 2 / 3 [ 159 ] . Apart from stabilizing the structure of the Golgi complex , actin is involved in vesicle budding from the trans - Golgi - network and several actin motor proteins are known to mediate transport of Golgi - derived vesicles [ 158 , 160 ] . 3 . 5 RhoD and the Golgi apparatus There is to date only one published study on the function of RhoD at the Golgi apparatus , which is included in this thesis ( Paper I ) . Briefly , endogenous RhoD was found to co - localize with Golgi markers . Both overexpression and silencing of RhoD resulted in an altered Golgi morphology with a loss of a compact Golgi ribbon structure . RhoD was found to play a role in protein transport from ER to the plasma membrane via the GA . One interaction partner of RhoD , WHAMM , has previously been found to reside in Golgi membranes and similar to RhoD , WHAMM has been found to affect the Golgi morphology and ER to plasma membrane protein transport . It is , however , not established whether RhoD and WHAMM act via the same signaling pathway . 23 4 Vesicle dynamics The different cellular vesicles enable protein trafficking between organelles and allow exchange of membrane components . Depending on the cellular route , the vesicles have different compositions . One class of vesicles is called endosomes , and is responsible for transport from the plasma membrane into the cell . 4 . 1 Early , late and recycling endosomes When a soluble protein or a membrane - bound receptor at the plasma membrane is internalized , the plasma membrane buds inwards and eventually fuses with an early endosome , the first vesicle compartment in the endocytic pathway . At the early endosome , the cargo is sorted to one out of three routes ; ( 1 ) recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes , ( 2 ) sorted to late endosomes to be degraded in the lysosome or ( 3 ) delivered to the trans - Golgi network ( Fig 13 ) [ 161 ] . Figure 13 . The endocytic pathway . Lysosome Late endosome - Rab7 Recycling endosome - Rab11 Primary endocytic vesicle Early endosome - Rab5 Golgi apparatus 3 1 2 Plasma membrane 24 The small GTPases of the Rab family constitute an important group of endocytic regulators . Their localization to endocytic compartments directs vesicle trafficking in a specific way . When in active GTP - bound conformation , they facilitate vesicle budding , motility and tethering / fusion by recruiting effector proteins . Rab5 localizes to early endosomes and is commonly used as a marker for this compartment . In the same way , Rab11 is found predominantly in recycling endosome membranes and Rab7 in late endosomes [ 162 ] ( Fig 13 ) . 4 . 2 Vesicle trafficking The transport of a vesicle can be divided into four steps ; ( 1 ) formation of a vesicle from the donor membrane , ( 2 ) movement to the target compartment , ( 3 ) docking to the acceptor membrane and finally ( 4 ) fusion . Rab proteins are involved in each of the four steps . ( 1 ) Rab9 can recruit a sorting adaptor to the membrane of a forming vesicle and increase the affinity between the sorting adaptor and its cargo [ 163 ] . ( 2 ) Vesicles are transported by motor proteins moving on actin filaments ( for short - range transport ) or microtubules ( for long - range transport ) . A Rab11 effector protein can function as a myosin adaptor , linking the Rab - bound vesicle to the motor protein . Rab8a can interact directly with myosin proteins , whereas Rab6 can bind directly to a kinesin motor protein [ 164 - 166 ] . ( 3 ) In order for vesicles to fuse with the acceptor membrane , they need to be brought into close proximity . The Rab5 effector EEA1 acts as a tethering factor and can draw the two endosomes close together [ 167 ] . ( 4 ) In addition , EEA1 interacts with t - SNARE proteins which are required for the fusion of the vesicle with the acceptor membrane [ 168 , 169 ] . 4 . 3 RhoD and vesicle dynamics One of the first described functions for RhoD was a role in endosome fusion and trafficking . Endosome fusion stimulated by the constitutively active mutant Rab5 Q79L was inhibited by the constitutively active mutant RhoD G26V but not by RhoD wt [ 52 ] . In up - following studies , RhoD G26V was shown to reduce both short and long - range endosome motility [ 170 ] in a Src - dependent way [ 171 ] . More specifically , RhoD has been described to co - localize mostly with Rab5 and Rab11 positive vesicle and less with Rab7 positive vesicles . [ 172 ] . An interaction between RhoD and the Rab5 effector Rabankyrin - 5 was found in a 25 yeast two - hybrid screen . Confirming the interaction by co - immunoprecipitation , revealed that Rabankyrin - 5 interacts both with RhoD - GDP and RhoD - GTP . When co - expressing RhoD G26V , Rab5 Q79L and Rabankyrin - 5 , they all co - localized at vesicles . Silencing of Rabankyrin - 5 altered the localization of RhoD positive vesicles to a more perinuclear distribution , and silencing of RhoD had a similar effect on Rabankyrin - 5 positive vesicles . In addition , internalization of the platelet derived growth factor receptor β ( PDGFRβ ) after PDGF - BB stimulation was reduced after RhoD silencing in fibroblasts , together with a reduced PDGFRβ - downstream signaling [ 172 ] . 27 II . AIMS OF THE THESIS The vast majority of studies published on Rho GTPases has focused on the three classical members RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 . The atypical Rho GTPases are generally less studied than the classical ones , but even among these , RhoD is still one of the most uncharacterized Rho GTPases . The overall aim of the thesis is to broaden the knowledge of the Rho GTPase RhoD . Paper I : We found that the endogenous RhoD , as well as its interaction partner WHAMM , localize to the Golgi apparatus . We therefore sought to examine how the two proteins affected the structure and function of this organelle . - How does altered protein levels of RhoD and WHAMM affect Golgi homeostasis ? - How does altered protein levels of RhoD and WHAMM affect anterograde protein transport ? Paper II : RhoD has been shown to modify the actin cytoskeleton in several cell lines . In this paper , we wanted to investigate the actin phenotype in cell types not previously studied . The cell types chosen had distinctively different actin phenotypes when non - transfected . We also studied cellular processes known to be strongly dependent upon actin dynamics in fibroblasts , a cell type we have previously used for RhoD studies . - How does altered protein levels of RhoD affect the actin cytoskeleton in an enlarged cell type study ? - How does altered protein levels of RhoD affect cell migration and cell division ? - What happens to the actin phenotype when RhoD localization is defective ? 28 Paper III : One of the first publications of RhoD describes a function of RhoD at endosomes , but few additional studies on this matter have been published . Therefore , we investigated the dynamics of RhoD positive vesicles in fibroblast , where the localization to vesicles is distinct and relatively easy to monitor . Furthermore , the function of the unique N - terminal motif of RhoD was studied . - Is there a difference in localization to vesicles between GTP - RhoD , GDP - RhoD and GTP / GDP - cycling RhoD ? - Is there a difference in vesicle size ( due to altered fusion / fission ) between GTP - RhoD , GDP - RhoD and GTP / GDP - cycling RhoD ? - Is the unique N - terminal of RhoD required for vesicle localization and vesicle fusion ? - Is the unique N - terminal of RhoD required to exert its effect on the actin cytoskeleton ? 29 III . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This thesis focuses on the role of RhoD in three cellular dynamic processes ; Golgi homeostasis , actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vesicle transport and fusion . RhoD and Golgi ( Paper I ) We found , using a commercial antibody that the endogenous RhoD localized to the Golgi apparatus , similar to its interaction partner WHAMM . We examined the co - localization of RhoD with several established Golgi markers , such as the cis - Golgi matrix protein 130 ( GM130 ) or the trans - Golgi marker 1 , 4 - galactosyltransferease ( GalT ) . STED microscopy revealed that RhoD had a higher degree of co - localization with GalT than with GM130 . Treatment with drugs disrupting the Golgi ribbon ( Nocodazole ) or the stacking of cisternae ( brefeldin A ) had no major effect on co - localization between WHAMM and GM130 , as already reported [ 173 ] . However , RhoD could no longer be found together with GM130 after the same treatments . This suggests that WHAMM localizes to the cisterna membrane , while RhoD might be dependent upon a Golgi tethering protein to be associated with the Golgi membrane . We further studied how the Golgi structure was affected by altered protein levels of RhoD and WHAMM , by analyzing the fraction of cells with Golgi “dispersion” . We used this term in a broad sense , meaning both expansion of the Golgi apparatus and disruption of the Golgi ribbon structure into vesicles . Exogenous expression of RhoD in COS1 cells , independent of GTP / GTP - bound state , led to a dispersed Golgi phenotype in 40 - 55 % of the transfected cells , ( compared to < 10 % in control cells ) . In agreement with published data , overexpression of WHAMM led to disruption of the Golgi ribbon structure . Similarly , silencing of RhoD led to a dispersed Golgi apparatus in ~ 40 % of the cells whereas the corresponding number for silencing of WHAMM was ~ 30 % ( compared to ~ 5 % in control cells ) . Golgi is a central organelle for protein trafficking . We therefore sought to investigate whether the effect of RhoD and WHAMM on Golgi homeostasis affected the anterograde protein transport by monitoring the transport of the GFP - tagged VSV - G protein . This protein is kept misfolded in the ER when cells are cultured at 40 °C . When lowering the temperature ( to 32 °C ) , VSV - G is correctly folded and transported via the Golgi to the plasma membrane . By fixing transfected cells at various time points , we could follow the transport of VSV - G in 30 cells transiently transfected with RhoD or WHAMM constructs , as well as RhoD and WHAMM targeting siRNA . We could see that the transport between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane was delayed when RhoD or WHAMM was silenced ; however , the transport from ER - to - Golgi was indistinguishable from the control . Transient expression of RhoD or WHAMM gave a profound effect on the VSV - G transport all the way from the ER to the plasma membrane . Moreover , VSV - G was less protected against Endoglycosidase H cleavage in cells with altered RhoD and WHAMM protein levels , indicating a restricted Golgi function in these cells . The question whether RhoD and WHAMM act through the same pathway cannot be unequivocally answered . Simultaneous silencing of RhoD and WHAMM gives an additive effect , indicating that RhoD and WHAMM act partly though different pathways . However , we could see that expression of RhoD wt , but not RhoD T31N , could rescue the Golgi dispersion caused by WHAMM silencing , indicating that RhoD helps to tether Golgi in absence of WHAMM . Moreover , since RhoD silencing affects the Golgi structure , the endogenous WHAMM localization is affected and vice versa . This could , however , be an indirect effect . Exogenous expression can lead to many side effects due to sequestering of proteins and shift in equilibriums . The most significant finding of RhoD in this paper is therefore the effect on Golgi morphology after RhoD silencing . WHAMM silencing leads to an expansion of the Golgi , but the morphology is less altered . In addition to Golgi expansion , RhoD silencing results in loss of shape , and the Golgi starts to “unwind” ( Fig 14 ) . Golgi tethering factors keep the Golgi ribbon and stacks intact [ 174 ] . It is possible that RhoD is needed for the function or localization of such a protein , leading to an “unwound” Golgi in RhoD silenced cells . To date , the only known RhoD interaction partner at the Golgi is WHAMM [ 80 ] . However , WHAMM seems to reside in the trans - Golgi area and RhoD in the cis - Golgi area ( Paper I and [ 173 ] ) , and disruption of the Golgi structure by Nocodazole and Brefeldin A treatment have different outcomes for the two proteins . This could indicate that the interaction between RhoD and WHAMM is transient . RhoD interacts with the N - terminal of WHAMM , which is needed for membrane localization [ 80 , 175 ] , suggesting that RhoD could interfere with the WHAMM localization . With this article , we have shown that endogenous RhoD localizes to the Golgi apparatus , and that a proper balance of the protein is needed to maintain an intact Golgi structure and function . 31 Figure 14 . The Golgi marker GM130 in BJ fibroblasts treated with Ctrl siRNA , WHAMM siRNA , RhoD siRNA or the drugs Brefeldin A and Nocodazole . RhoD and actin ( Paper II ) We found that cell types with distinctly different actin cytoskeleton organization when non - transfected ( HeLa , U2OS and U251MG ) , had a similar actin phenotype when overexpressing RhoD . This includes dissolution of stress fibers and the development of a less dynamic actin cytoskeleton , often accompanied by filopodia formation . In fact , also other F - actin structures , such as ruffles and cortical actin were dissolved and reorganized into thin actin bundles . Silencing of RhoD had an opposite effect , enhancing the actin organization present in each cell type , leading to more ruffles , cortical actin and stress fibers , depending on cell type . When RhoD was silenced in fibroblasts , we saw that actin - dependent cellular processes were affected , such as cell migration and cell proliferation . For a fibroblast to migrate in a persistent way , the orientation and number of lamellipodia must be regulated . Live cell imaging of RhoD silenced fibroblasts showed that the cells had a decreased persistence of directed cell migration , since the total migration distance , but not the Euclidean distance , was longer compared to control cells , revealing a longer migration distance to reach the same goal . The same results were seen when adding a chemotactic cue C on t r o l s i R NA R ho D s i R NA W HA MM s i R NA B F A t r ea t m e n t N o c od az o l e t r ea t m e n t 32 ( PDGF - BB ) . Although cells lacking RhoD migrated roughly the same Euclidean distance compared to the control cells , the total migration distance was longer ( but non - significant in these experiments ) . It has been reported that the PDGF downstream signaling is weaker in RhoD silenced fibroblasts [ 172 ] , which could partly explain decreased sensitivity towards a PDGF gradient . However , complementary data from a scratch - wound assay reveals that the direct cell migration in absence of RhoD is suboptimal . Considering the extensive regulation of actin reorganization during cell migration , it is not surprising that Rho GTPases are master regulators of directed cell migration [ 176 ] . Cells lacking RhoD showed no impairment of the general migratory machinery , as they migrated even longer distances than control cells over the same time period . Moreover , RhoD silenced cells still displayed a polarized cell body . In this study , we saw that overexpression of RhoD led to decreased actin dynamics in several cell types . It is not clear if the reciprocal situation , i . e . RhoD silencing , leads to a more dynamic actin cytoskeleton , but the increased number of ruffles in U251MG cells suggests that this is likely to be the case . Increased actin dynamics could interfere with the stability of a lamellipodia , thereby making it more difficult for the leading edge to steer the cell persistently in one direction . In addition , FA size is correlated with cell speed . Smaller or larger FAs than the optimum size leads to a decreased speed of migration [ 177 ] . RhoD knock down in fibroblast has previously been shown to increase the FA size , while overexpression leads to smaller FAs [ 80 , 135 ] . RhoD silenced fibroblasts showed slower proliferation rate than control cells . We first suspected an impairment of the cytokinesis , since the cytokinesis is heavily dependent upon actin reorganization , and microinjection of RhoD G26V has been described to inhibit cytokinesis [ 135 ] . When measuring the time from pre - mitotic rounding up , to spreading after cytokines , we saw no difference in RhoD silenced cells compared to control cells , indicating that the prolonged cell cycle is caused by alterations during earlier phases of the cell - cycle . This is in agreement with the notion that a functional actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPase regulation are essential also in the earlier stages of the cell - cycle [ 178 ] . Transient expression of several Rho GTPases , such as Rnd1 and Rnd3 has been reported to result in stress fiber dissolution . In addition , the expression of p190ARhoGAP leads to the inhibition of RhoA and thereby inhibition of stress fibers ( Fig 15 ) [ 179 ] . Visualizing F - actin by the fluorescently labeled phalloidin shows that HeLa cells overexpressing Rnd1 , Rnd3 and p190ARhoGAP lose their stress fibers . The dissolved stress fibers are not reorganized into other F - actin - containing structures , therefore , a weak actin signal is acquired . In contrast , in cells overexpressing RhoD , the F - actin signal remains strong . In these cells , the stress fibers 33 are dissolved , but instead , an intertwined weave of actin filaments is seen ( Fig 15 ) . This indicates that RhoD , in contrast to Rnd1 and Rnd3 , rather stimulate a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , where thin actin bundles are induced at the expense of stress fibers , or cortical actin and ruffles in other cell types . Figure 15 . F - actin phenotype in HeLa cells overexpressing proteins known to dissolve stress fibers . Cells were stained with phalloidin . All acquired pictures were sub - saturated and later adjusted in an identical way , i . e . the stronger phalloidin signal in RhoD is not due to a different handling of the pictures . Another striking sign that RhoD functions as a modulator of the actin cytoskeleton can be seen when the C - terminal CAAX - motif is mutated . This motif is found in many small GTPases and undergoes post - translational processing , leading to insertion of the small GTPase into lipid bilayers [ 1 ] . The mutation of the RhoD CAAX ( which we named RhoD SAAX ) prevented the prenylation ( most likely a farnesylation ) of RhoD and , as a consequence , the localization of RhoD is altered . RhoD SAAX still associated with the plasma membrane and induced filopodia , but it no longer localized to vesicles . Surprisingly , actin stress fibers were no longer suppressed , but instead strongly induced . This reveals the strong intrinsic ability of RhoD to regulate the actin cytoskeleton . Taken together , this paper demonstrates that RhoD silencing has different effects on the actin cytoskeleton depending on cell type , but overexpression leads to induction of thin actin 34 bundles overriding all other actin - containing structures . Loss of RhoD in fibroblasts also results in effects on actin - dependent processes , such as cell migration and proliferation . RhoD and vesicle dynamics ( Paper III ) Exogenously RhoD has been reported to localize to vesicles in several cell types [ 52 , 172 ] . To study the function of RhoD at vesicles , we used BJ fibroblast cells , as RhoD localization to vesicles in this cell line is distinct and thus relatively easy to monitor . We could see that both the GDP and GTP - bound RhoD were associated with vesicles . In contrast , only GTP - bound RhoD localized to the plasma membrane . One of the initial publications on RhoD revealed a role in endosome fusion and trafficking [ 52 ] . We could see that RhoD wt and RhoD T31N positive vesicles fused and formed larger vesicles with visible lumina . However , the constitutively active RhoD G26V was associated with smaller vesicles without detectable lumina . These results are in line with earlier findings , where RhoD G26V inhibited Rab5 - induced endosome fusion , but RhoD wt did not [ 52 ] . This suggests that RhoD must be inactivated to enable vesicle fusion . Furthermore , we saw a significant increase in number of vesicles per cell when expressing RhoD G26V compared to RhoD wt / T31N , but no difference between cells expressing RhoD wt and RhoD T31N , emphasizing the inability of RhoD G26V - postive vesicles to fuse . When quantifying the localization of RhoD - positive vesicles in the cell , we saw that RhoD wt and T31N were mainly perinuclear , whereas the RhoD G26V vesicles were predominantly dispersed . This means that , in contrast to the localization of RhoD to vesicles , the subcellular localization of the vesicles is dependent upon the GTP / GDP - bound state of RhoD . Since RhoD G26V - postive vesicles were more dispersed , we expected a more pronounced localization to the plasma membrane , given that the vesicles eventually fuse with the plasma membrane . This could not be established , leaving the question open on how RhoD is inserted into the plasma membrane . Unfortunately , it is difficult to perform live - cell imaging on RhoD - vesicle dynamics , since fluorescent protein tags ( GFP , mCherry , Tomato ) strongly promote plasma membrane localization of RhoD , rendering the vesicles difficult to detect . N - terminally to the GTPase domain , RhoD has a unique extension with unknown function . Deletion of these 12 amino acids , led to strikingly different vesicle phenotypes ( however , not for the dominant negative RhoD ) . The ΔNT - RhoD wt and G26V - postive vesicles were often seen in clusters or as beads on a string along the plasma membrane border . They appeared 35 “sticky” and many cells were fully packed with vesicles . This observation raises the question if RhoD degradation is dependent upon the N - terminal motif . Just as its full length counterparts , the ΔNT - RhoD wt fused to form larger vesicles , whereas ΔNT - RhoD G26V did not . We also investigated whether or not the N - terminal motif was required for RhoD to induce thin actin bundles in favor of stress fibers . We found that the deletion mutants had the same capability to dissolve stress fibers as the full length RhoD wt and G26V . In this study , we showed that RhoD localization to the plasma membrane is GDP / GTP - dependent , whereas the vesicle localization is not . In addition , the size of the vesicle is dependent upon the GTP / GDP state of RhoD . The N - terminal motif of RhoD is not required for the RhoD - induced actin rearrangement , but its deletion causes altered localization and characteristics of the RhoD - postive vesicles . 37 IV .
