High - speed atomic force microscopy shows that annexin V stabilizes membranes on the second timescale Atsushi Miyagi 1 , Christophe Chipot 2 , 3 , Martina Rangl 1 and Simon Scheuring 1 * Annexins are abundant cytoplasmic proteins that can bind to negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner , and are known to play a role in the storage of Ca 2 + and membrane healing . Little is known , however , about the dynamic processes of protein – Ca 2 + – membrane assembly and disassembly . Here we show that high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) can be used to repeatedly induce and disrupt annexin assemblies and study their structure , dynamics and interactions . Our HS - AFM set - up is adapted for such biological applications through the integration of a pumping system for buffer exchange and a pulsed laser system for uncaging caged compounds . We ﬁ nd that biochemically identical annexins ( annexin V ) display different effective Ca 2 + and membrane af ﬁ nities depending on the assembly location , providing a wide Ca 2 + buffering regime while maintaining membrane stabilization . We also show that annexin is membrane - recruited and forms stable supramolecular assemblies within ∼ 5 s in conditions that are comparable to a membrane lesion in a cell . Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomic detail of the role played by Ca 2 + in the reversible binding of annexin to the membrane surface . A nnexins are ubiquitous eukaryotic cytoplasmic proteins of ∼ 35 kDa ( an exception is annexin VI ; ∼ 70 kDa ) that consti - tute about 2 % of intracellular proteins . They associate with negatively charged phospholipids at the inner lea ﬂ et of the plasma membrane , mediated by Ca2 + ( ref . 1 ) . The af ﬁ nity of annexins alone for Ca 2 + was reported to be low , of the order of 500 µM , however , in the presence of and bound to a negatively charged bilayer the af ﬁ nity is ∼ 10 µM , although values in the literature vary 2 . Annexins are reported to be implicated in many functions related to the cell membrane , such as those relating to the cytoske - leton , exocytosis and endocytosis 3 and regulating ion ﬂ ow 4 . Through membrane binding annexins may also modulate access of other proteins to the membrane and hence tune signalling 2 . Annexins have further been shown to play important roles in Ca 2 + binding and cell membrane repair 5 . Indeed , the low Ca 2 + con - centration in the cell , ∼ 0 . 1 µM , compared with ∼ 2 mM outside the cell , leads to annexin assembly at plasma membrane damage sites due to Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux , stabilizing the membrane and allowing lipids to correct the defect 5 , 6 . In biotechnology , annexin is widely used for apoptosis detection : at the early state of apoptosis , membrane asymmetry — notably the concentration of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) at the inner lea ﬂ et — is lost ; a process that is sensitively detected by annexins 7 . Proteins of the annexin family are structurally well characterized , with ∼ 84 high - resolution structures of several members . The typical annexin core ( annexin VI consists of two cores ) consists of about 310 amino acids distributed in four annexin repeats , which are bundles of ﬁ ve short α - helices 1 . In this study , we focused on annexin V ( A5 ) ( for example , PDBs 1ALA , 2H0K ; refs 5 , 8 ) . A5 is a 36 kDa hydrophilic protein with an amphipathic face and an isoelectric point of 4 . 5 ( ref . 9 ) . High - resolution X - ray crystallo - graphy of the structures shows Ca 2 + binding to the loops of each annexin repeat , although reports diverge about the precise number of Ca 2 + binding sites 5 . At a lower resolution , electron microscopy ( EM ) and AFM studies have revealed the supramolecular assemblies of annexins on lipid bilayers and showed that A5 forms intricate regular lattices made of trimers 10 – 16 . Electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy of site - directed spin - labelled annexin XII revealed that trimer for - mation itself occurs on the millisecond timescale whereas subunit exchange takes minutes 17 . Most recently , HS - AFM 18 , 19 has shown potential for the visualization of the lattice assembly process 19 . Evidence that the regular annexin two - dimensional ( 2D ) lattices are native and essential in cellular mechanisms such as membrane repair has now been accumulated 5 . The binding of annexins to Ca 2 + and to negatively charged phos - pholipids has been intensely studied 20 . Although some of the data and interpretations vary , consensus emerged that alone A5 has a low ( of the order of 500 µM ) af ﬁ nity with Ca 2 + af ﬁ nity , but that the value is much higher ( 10 µM range ) in the presence of negatively charged lipids . More recently , using isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , it has been shown that membrane - bound A5 displayed two distinct classes of Ca 2 + binding sites with different Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities ( 2 . 4 and 170 µM , respectively ) , yet both are higher than the sol - ution - state af ﬁ nity ( 330 µM ) 2 . Using HS - AFM dynamic high - resolution imaging we provide a detailed view of A5 assembly . To our HS - AFM set - up we added a pumping system and a pulsed - laser compound uncaging system that allows us to control ion availability during imaging . Using these developments we show that two families of A5 — dependent on the location in the lattice — coexist with different apparent mem - brane and Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities , which is probably relevant for Ca 2 + buffer - ing . We further show that A5 assembly , under conditions similar to a membrane lesion , is accomplished within a few seconds . 1 U1006 INSERM , Université Aix - Marseille , Parc Scienti ﬁ que et Technologique de Luminy , 163 avenue de Luminy , 13009 Marseille , France . 2 Laboratoire International Associé Centre National de la Recherche Scienti ﬁ que et University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , UMR 7565 , Université de Lorraine , BP 70239 , 54506 Vand œ uvre - lès - Nancy cedex , France . 3 Department of Physics , University of Illinois at Urbana − Champaign , 1110 West Green Street , Urbana , Illinois 61801 , USA . * e - mail : simon . scheuring @ inserm . fr ARTICLES PUBLISHED ONLINE : 6 JUNE 2016 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / NNANO . 2016 . 89 NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 1 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved The A5 p 6 lattice structure In an attempt to study the tripartite interplay between A5 , Ca 2 + and negatively charged phospholipids , we have ﬁ rst grown supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) containing 20 % phosphatidylserine immersed in a buffer containing typically 2 mM Ca 2 + , followed by the addition of A5 . Shortly after , a highly ordered 2D lattice of A5 was observed ( Fig . 1a ) . In agreement with former pioneering studies using EM 11 , 12 and conventional AFM 15 , we found A5 trimers ( Fig . 1a , labelled 1 ) assembling in a lattice with p 6 symmetry ( unit cell : a = b = 17 . 7 nm , γ = 60° , where γ is the inclusion angle between vectors a and b , being 360° / n , with n being 6 for a p 6 lattice ) ( Fig . 1a , dashed outline ) . In time - averaged topographs an ill - de ﬁ ned and apparently lower ( com - pared with the surrounding p 6 lattice trimers ) molecular topography was observed at the p 6 axis location ( Fig . 1a , labelled 2 ) , which is also in agreement with earlier EM and AFM studies . At some locations these molecules were missing , thereby giving access to a ∼ 3 . 5 nm deep cavity down to the SLB surface ( Fig . 1a , labelled 3 ) . Through cross - correlation ﬁ tting of the surface rendered A5 - structure with the high - resolution AFM data , we determined the positions and angular alignments of the molecules within the experimental lattice and calculated an atomic model of the A5 - assembly ( Fig . 1b ; see Methods Section ‘ Structure modelling ’ ) . From this structural model , we identi ﬁ ed that the third annexin repeat evolved for pairwise contact ( Fig . 1c ) . Indeed the third repeat protrudes from the A5 trimer and engages with p 2 symmetry in a handshake - like tight junction , which is electrostatically stabilized by the positive and negative charges facing each other ( Fig . 1c ) . We ﬁ nd that the amino acids in the ﬁ rst ( Gln174 , Gln177 , Phe180 ) and the third ( Thr215 , Ile216 , Ser217 ) helix of the third annexin repeat are key in this interaction . The backbone atoms of the partners approach to ∼ 3 Å distance at this interface . We identify Phe180 as a noteworthy residue , its aromatic rings in adjacent monomers overlap , suggesting that minor reorientation of the side chains would allow formation of stable π stacking ( Fig . 1d ) . The structure and interaction of the non - p 6 trimer Granted improvements in HS - AFM 21 , image acquisition at frame rates from 1 , 000 ms to 20 ms per frame were achieved . At high image acquisition speeds , the molecule at the p 6 axis location ( Fig . 1a , labelled 2 ) was well resolved as a trimer with a similar topo - graphy and height to the trimers of the p 6 lattice ( Fig . 2a ) . Interestingly , this trimer adopted two major orientations , which d c b 5 nm Assembly model p 6 lattice a 1 7 . 7 n m 2 3 1 Figure 1 | The structure of 2D A5 arrays grown in the presence of 2 mM Ca 2 + on a lipid bilayer containing 20 % negatively charged PS . a , High - resolution AFM topograph of an 2D A5 array ( average over 20 s of HS - AFM image acquisition ) .

All rights reserved we have termed up ( Fig . 2a , top panel ) and down ( Fig . 2a , bottom panel ) depending on the triangular orientation with respect to the horizontal axis . The orientation of the trimers at the p 6 axis location was not preserved among them , and each individual trimer also dis - played a high degree of rotational freedom , which could be moni - tored by HS - AFM ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) . From this observation it is clear why conventional AFM ( averaging over time due to the slow imaging process ) and EM ( averaging over unit cells ) could not resolve this molecule : Its constant rotation and vari - able orientation within unit cells lead to the loss of molecular features during averaging in these techniques . We concluded that the A5 trimer must be attached to the membrane over Ca 2 + to the negatively charged PS ( similar to the p 6 trimers ) , but its interaction with neigh - bouring A5 trimers had to be very different compared to the p 6 trimers and weak , allowing rotational diffusion . We termed this A5 - trimer non - p 6 trimer as it does not participate in the p 6 lattice . This allowed us to complete our structural model of the A5 lattice , where an additional non - crystallographic trimer is located in the p 6 axis interstice ( Fig . 2b ) . To get more detailed information about the angular alignment of the non - p 6 trimer A5 , we performed extensive angular cross - correlation searches . In agreement with a threefold symmetric molecule rotating in a sixfold symmetric molecular environment , we found two major orientations , rotated by 60° with respect to each other ( both having threefold redundancy ; Fig . 2a ) , both being identical with respect to their molecular environment . Plotting the angular distribution of the rotational cross - correlation searches , we identi ﬁ ed that the histograms of each of these major alignments featured a shoulder , resulting in angular distributions peaking at − 7° and 0° and 53° and 60° , respectively ( Fig . 2c ) . Merging molecules with orientation alignments of 0° / 60° or − 7° / 53° , the average topographs of these two subclasses could be calcu - lated ( Fig . 2c , central inset , greyscale images labelled 1 and 2 ) . From the angular probability distribution p ( α ) , an interaction energy potential E ( α ) map of the non - p 6 trimer within the p 6 honey - comb could be calculated , following p ( α ) = p . e − E ( α ) / k B T ( where k B T is the thermal energy and k B the Boltzmann constant ) . This interaction energy landscape is described by a major well of − 6 k B T at 0° / 60° neighboured by a more shallow well of − 5 k B T at − 7° / 53° reaching out to about − 20° / 40° ( Fig . 2c , top inset ) . The well depth of − 6 k B T must be considered as a maximum estimate of the interaction strength : The existence of further low - probability orientations ( between the two major alignments ) that were not sampled would lead to a decrease in the well depth . Furthermore , the landscape might reveal further roughness that we were unable to detect , thus suggesting that − 6 k B T is an overestimation . In an attempt to obtain more quantitative information about the interaction strength , we analysed the interaction lifetimes of the angular associations . Disappointingly , analysing movies at 650 ms or much faster , at 100 ms and 20 ms frame rates ( Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 ) , resulted in very different lifetimes depending on the image acqui - sition rate , meaning that despite our efforts to use a minimal canti - lever - drive amplitude and minimal amplitude damping , the energy that the cantilever adds to the system increased the rotation of the molecules . We and our colleagues 19 have assessed the energy loss of an oscillating HS - AFM cantilever during a tap as ∼ 1 . 5 k B T , and although an A5 trimer is tapped many times , a lot of energy fed into the system is dissipated into the liquid . In conclusion , we believe that the shape of the interaction energy landscape is valid ( Fig . 2c , central inset ) , but that the energy well of − 6 k B T is an over - estimation , and is probably between − 1 and − 2 k B T , just high enough to allow the trimer to be resolved in each single frame . We further contend that the roughness in the energy landscape with two favourable con ﬁ gurations neighbouring each other pro - vides competition against a steady molecular interaction . Using the structural model , we examined the molecular basis of the inter - action of the non - p 6 trimer ( Fig . 2d ) .

In the − 7° / 53° orientation , the main partner is the C terminus of the p 6 trimer , with backbone distances of about 8 Å .

All rights reserved contact with the third helix of the third annexin repeat ( Thr215 , Ile216 , Ser217 , Gly218 ) with the fourth helix of the fourth annexin repeat ( Ser295 , Tyr297 , Ser298 ) of the neighbouring p 6 trimers . When the non - p 6 trimer is rotated by − 7° the main interaction occurs with the C terminus of the lattice trimers ( Fig . 2e ) , rationalizing its weak and ﬂ exible interaction . In both cases the distance from the protein backbone is signi ﬁ - cantly larger ( ∼ 6 Å and ∼ 8 Å , respectively ) than that between the lattice trimers ( ∼ 3 Å ) . Enhancing HS - AFM for slow and rapid buffer changes Intrigued by the dynamics of the supramolecular A5 structure , we anticipated that further insights into the two subclasses of A5 trimers might be gained when analysing the assembly and disassembly dynamics of the lattice . To this end , we developed bio - enhanced HS - AFM and undertook two major additions to our HS - AFM system ( Fig . 3a ) : First , we connected a high - precision buffer exchange pump system to the ﬂ uid cell . This constant - pressure and constant - ﬂ ow pump system concomitantly injects the buffer solution on one side and removes it on the other side of the ﬂ uid cell at rates ranging from 0 . 01 to 1 µl s – 1 ( Fig . 3b ) , allowing complex buffer composition changes such as the gradual addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) . Second , we introduced a pulsed UV laser into the HS - AFM apparatus that allows photo - cleavable caged compounds to be liberated during imaging ( Fig . 3c ) . The focal volume of the pulsed UV laser beam is ∼ 1 pl , ∼ 120 , 000 , 000 times smaller than the 120 µl observation buffer in the ﬂ uid cell ( see Methods ) . Therefore , the uncaged compounds will diffuse rapidly out of the focal volume after switching off the laser and dilute ∼ 10 8 times in the ﬂ uid cell , meaning that compound release could be performed repeatedly . In the ﬁ rst experiment we used a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 4 . 5 mM caged Ca 2 + and 600 nM A5 .

All rights reserved ordered 2D A5 lattice ( Fig . 3d , t = 15 s ) . Following this , a buffer containing 40 mM EDTA was slowly injected until the 2D A5 crystal disassembled ( Fig . 3d , t = 277 s ) . Pulsed UV laser ﬂ ashes induced the reassembly of A5 2D crystals mediated by Ca 2 + uncaging ( Fig . 3d , t = 441 s ) . Switching off the UV laser led to the dissociation of the A5 from the membrane again ( Fig . 3d , t = 870 s ) . The process could berepeatedseveraltimes ( SupplementaryMovie4 ) . TheA5membrane association and lattice formation occurred within ∼ 5 s on Ca 2 + unca - ging . A quantum yield of 0 . 18 and Ca 2 + release kinetics of ∼ 100 µs have been characterized for the caging compound used here ( DM - nitrophen ) 22 . Given the presence of 4 . 5 mM DM - nitrophen caged Ca 2 + , the release yield and kinetics , we estimate that our laser pulses at 5 kHz and an intensity of 0 . 1 µJ create conditions that are comparable to the in ﬂ ux of 2 mM Ca 2 + on membrane lesion , with a time delay much shorter ( < 1 ms ) than the frame acquisition ( > 100 ms ) . In the second experiment , we imaged 2D A5 lattices at a high res - olution ( Fig . 3e , t = 107 s ) , to which we added EDTA via the buffer exchange system ( Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Pumping is so smooth and slow that no imaging perturbation was observed . As EDTA mixes into the ﬂ uid cell , it complexes Ca 2 + , leading to the dis - sociation of A5 from the membrane ( Fig . 3e , t = 345 s ) . Interestingly , the non - p 6 trimers dissociated ﬁ rst from the lattice and the lattice edges were also more sensitive to Ca 2 + withdrawal , indicating that the lattice location confers not only rotational freedom to the non - p 6 trimers , but also modulates the strength of the membrane association ( Fig . 3e , t = 276 s ) . Different Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities of A5 depending on assembly Taking advantage of the experimental environment control system , we investigated the varying association strength of the molecules within the A5 assembly ( Fig . 4 ) . To this end , we per - formed 2D lattice formation ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Movie 6 ) and dissociation ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Movie 7 ) experiments by in ﬂ ow or diluting Ca 2 + , respectively . Knowing the starting and injected buffer conditions ( Fig . 4 , Buffers 1 , 2 ) , the total volume and the pumping rate , the buffer conditions can be calculated and plotted for each time t , as well as the structural changes of the A5 lattices directly related to the Ca 2 + concentration at time t . On the basis of the imaging observations ( Fig . 5a , b ) , the number of molecules belonging to the lattice p 6 trimer or the non - p 6 trimer classes were ‘ counted ’ through cross - correlation searches 23 and plotted as function of the Ca 2 + concentration in the buffer during association ( Fig . 5c ) and dissociation ( Fig . 5d ) : We observed apparent Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities of about 600 and 800 µM for the lattice p 6 trimer and non - p 6 trimer , respectively , during lattice formation and about 1 , 000 and 600 µM for the non - p 6 trimer and the p 6 trimer when the lattice dissociated . The apparent Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities of the two classes were different , as were the slopes of the concentration - dependent association and dissociation beha - viours ; with the p 6 trimer revealing in both cases the steeper con - centration dependence . This is an indication of the cooperativity of the membrane – Ca 2 + binding of the p 6 trimers compared with the non - p 6 trimers .

It is noteworthy that HS - AFM imaging is limited to rather small scan areas , and it is probable that other areas on the support are protein - free or protein - covered ( or that proteins dissociate earlier or later ) during associ - ation and dissociation , respectively , suggesting that the apparent Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities might cover larger concentration ranges . The impor - tant aspect of our ﬁ nding , however , is that in all experiments per - formed ( using Ca 2 + addition or Ca 2 + removal through EDTA - addition or dilution ) the biochemically identical non - p 6 trimers and p 6 trimers exhibit different apparent Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities , with the non - p 6 trimers possessing a lower af ﬁ nity than the p 6 trimers ( Fig . 5e ) . This result indicates that a wide range of Ca 2 + concen - trations can be buffered by the association of cytosolic annexins with the plasma membrane . Ca 2 + plays the role of molecular glue To gain further insight into the protein – Ca 2 + – membrane tripartite interaction we performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simu - lations . The A5 trimer ( PDB 2IE7 ) was ﬁ rst placed at the surface of a thermalized DOPC : DOPS lipid bilayer , immersed in a 125 mM calcium chloride buffer and simulated over 152 ns . Over the course of the simulation , as many as sixteen calcium - mediated protein – lipid interactions were established . The formation of such interactions , wherein the divalent cation glues A5 to the membrane , does not necessarily mean that the calcium binding sites of each annexin monomer are engaged simultaneously in salt bridges with lipids . In fact , notwithstanding local deformations of the bilayer , no concomitant formation of salt bridges involving all of the calcium binding sites of the trimer was observed , owing to the Membrane a c Concentration ( mM ) A 5 c oun t ( n ) Membrane p 6 A5 p 6 + non - p 6 A5 p 6 + non - p 6 A5 p 6 A5 b e d Concentration ( mM ) A 5 c oun t ( n ) Membrane All Ca 2 + bound Membrane Membrane 2 / 3 A5 + Ca 2 + bound Solution 1 / 3 A5 + Ca 2 + Solution 2 / 3 A5 + Ca 2 + k on ( p 6 ) k off ( p 6 ) k on ( non - p 6 ) k off ( non - p 6 ) Solution 2 / 3 A5 + Ca 2 + Solution 1 / 3 A5 + Ca 2 + p 6 Non - p 6 Assembly p 6 Non - p 6 Disassembly 70 nm 70 nm 70 nm 70 nm 70 nm 70 nm 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 Figure 5 | A5 Ca 2 + - mediated buffering and apparent assembly - related Ca 2 + af ﬁ nity . a , b , HS - AFM movie frames showing the A5 lattice assembly ( a ) and dissociation ( b ) from the membrane , respectively .

All rights reserved convex surface of the protein in contact with the membrane . Over the same period of time , Ca 2 + never dissociated from the membrane . Interestingly , one Ca 2 + ion can be chelated by more than one lipid molecule . In the course of the simulation , Ca 2 + ions rapidly satu - rated the negatively charged convex A5 face in immediate contact with the bilayer . Out of the total number of contacts recorded over the trajectory , only 5 – 6 actually involve the cations bound to residues Glu72 , Glu144 and Asp303 , demonstrating that the protein , in the presence of Ca 2 + , also has non - speci ﬁ c af ﬁ nity to a negatively charged membrane . The average equilibrium distance between the centre of mass of the A5 trimer and that of the lipid bilayer was ∼ 40 . 6 Å , with sporadic excursions to < 38 Å that corre - spond to transient changes in the membrane curvature ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , there are portions of A5 ensconced in the membrane , chief among which is the loop spanning Lys101 through Thr105 , with Ala103 snorkelling amidst the aliphatic chains . It is worth noting that the amplitude of the displacement of the protein away from the membrane surface is particularly small , amounting to ∼ 3 Å , consistent with strong cohesive forces . The strong tripartite interaction can be understood by means of a toy model consisting of a cation coordinated by two acetate ions . The potential of mean force ( PMF ) characterizing the three - body association was determined in two comparative assays , wherein either Ca 2 + or Na + is doubly chelated ( see the Supplementary Information ) . The difference in the binding free energies arising from calcium – sodium cation substitution derived from the PMFs of about 5 kcal mol – 1 , when multiplied by a realistic number of binding sites in the trimer as observed in the various structures , would yield a putative loss of af ﬁ nity in the 50 kcal mol – 1 range . This result , although based on a rudimentary model that does not account for the repulsive forces between the negatively charged sur - faces of A5 and the membrane , is consistent with the larger thermal ﬂ uctuations observed in equilibrium simulations with 125 mM NaCl ( see the Supplementary Information ) and the partial spon - taneous unbinding at 65 mM NaCl within 300 ns ( Fig . 6b ) . The tilt of the protein as it unbinds suggests that the different cation - mediated protein – lipid interactions do not break simultaneously , but in a sequential fashion ( Fig . 6c ) . As a basis of comparison , in the absence of cations A5 rapidly peels off from the membrane due to the unfavourable Coulombic interactions ( Fig . 6b , grey line ) . Conclusions In this work , we have integrated a constant - pressure and constant - ﬂ ow buffer exchange pump and a UV laser compound uncaging system with HS - AFM . These improvements allowed us to manip - ulate the biological sample under investigation while paving the way to performing real - time ‘ structural biochemistry ’ , giving access to biochemical and biophysical parameters such as af ﬁ nities and kinetics based on direct structural visualization . From the high - resolution analysis , we know that the A5 lattice comprises two - thirds p 6 trimers and one - third non - p 6 trimers ( Fig . 1 ) . The latter are not really part of the lattice and display rotational mobility within a honeycomb - shaped interspace of the p 6 lattice .

All rights reserved with the p 6 trimers are weak ( Fig . 2 ) . This feature is accompanied by a decreased membrane – Ca 2 + af ﬁ nity of the non - p 6 trimers compared with the p 6 trimers ( Figs 3 – 5 ) . Molecular dynamics simulations established the molecular bases of the protein – membrane interaction with Ca 2 + ions stacked between the protein loops and PS , acting as a glue between the two negatively charged surfaces ( Fig . 6 ) . Hence , the varying apparent Ca 2 + af ﬁ nities of the non - p 6 trimers and the p 6 trimers must emerge from protein – protein interactions within the A5 assembly . Interestingly , ITC measurements in bulk experiments have recently revealed two classes of Ca 2 + binding sites in mem - brane - bound A5 2 : the low - af ﬁ nity sites could correspond to the non - p 6 trimers and the high - af ﬁ nity sites to the p 6 trimers , respect - ively . The presence of two A5 classes provides two adjacent Ca 2 + buffer regimes — the high - af ﬁ nity A5 may maintain membrane stabil - ization by forming a stable p 6 lattice , whereas additional Ca 2 + can further be buffered by the integration of non - p 6 trimers into the lattice interstices . Most importantly , under conditions of a Ca 2 + ‘ shock ’ representing a membrane lesion and simulated here by UV laser uncaging of caged Ca 2 + , the A5 Ca 2 + binding and membrane association is completed within about 5 s , in agreement with ﬂ uor - escence accumulation measurements in injured cells 5 .

All rights reserved Methods HS - AFM . All movies in this study were taken by amplitude modulation mode HS - AFM ( RIBM , Japan ) . Short cantilevers ( NanoWorld , Switzerland ) with spring constant of 0 . 15 N m – 1 , resonance frequency of 0 . 6 MHz and a quality factor of ∼ 2 in buffer , were used . The energy delivered by a tip – sample interaction can be estimated following Δ E = ( 1 – α ) k c ( A 0 – A S2 ) / ( 2 Q c ) . Here α = 0 . 5 is the ratio of the amplitude reduction caused by the cantilever resonance frequencyshift over the total amplitude reduction , k c = 0 . 150 N nm – 1 is the cantilever spring constant , A 0 = 1 nm and A S = 0 . 9 nm are the free and the set - point amplitude and Q c = 2 is the cantilever quality factor , and the energy is about 1 . 5 k B T . HS - AFM was enhanced for biological applications by integrating a constant - pressure and constant - ﬂ ow pump system and a pulsed UV laser compound uncaging system to induce environmental changes in the sample during observation . A pump ( Harvard Instruments , USA ) was connected by two silicon tubes to the ﬂ uid cell pool cantilever holder for injecting and extracting solution at rates between 0 . 01 µl s – 1 and 1 µl s – 1 . The solutions in both tubing connections to the ﬂ uid cell pool between the injecting and observation buffers were separated by a tiny air bubble to prevent compound diffusion into the ﬂ uid cell before active buffer exchange through injection . The pumping system allows us to gradually increase and decrease the calcium ion concentration . A pulsed UV laser ( Explorer OEM model 349 - 120 - 1KE , Spectra - Physics , USA ) has been integrated in the HS - AFM to release caged compounds , in this case caged Ca 2 + . The UVlaser isfocused throughthe sameobjectiveastheHS - AFM IRlaserandits volume can be estimated as an oblate spheroid of about a × a × b = 5 μ m×5 μ m×10 μ m , resulting in an estimated focal volume of 1 , 047 µm 3 , following V = 4 / 3 π a 2 b ) , that is about ( 1 pl ) , assuring that caged Ca 2 + ion release is local to the HS - AFM tip . Furthermore the focal volume is 120 , 000 , 000 smaller than the total volume of the observation buffer ( 120 µl ) , therefore allowing uncaging of photo - cleavable compounds many times repeatedly in one sample . The UV laser system ( wavelength : 349 nm ) generates pulses of 1 to 10 ns in duration . The energy of each pulse is about 1 µJ and the pulse frequency is 5 kHz . We inserted a 1 / 10 re ﬂ ective ND ﬁ lter in front of the UV laser to reduce the pulse energy . Power reduction and pulsing of the UV laser allowed undisturbed high - resolution imaging during the uncaging process . Sample preparation . The A5 used in this study was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Annexin - V , 33kD from human placenta ) and all lipids ( dioleoyl - phosphatidyl - choline ( DOPC ) , dioleoyl - phosphatidyl - serine ( DOPS ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( cap - biotinyl ) ( biotinyl - DOPE ) ) from Avanti polar lipids . 2D A5 crystals were grown on SLBs by addition of A5 to a preformed lipid bilayer 24 . In brief , lipids were solubilized in chloroform at a ratio of DOPC : DOPS : biotinyl - DOPE = 7 : 2 : 1 or DOPC : DOPS = 8 : 2 . The solvent solubilized mixed lipids were dried by a nitrogen ﬂ ow and for further drying kept in a vacuum chamber for 30 min . Then the dried lipid wasresuspended intoa buffer solution containing10 mM HEPES NaCl at pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM CaCl 2 to form multilamellar vesicles . As the ﬁ nal step in lipid preparation the suspension was tip - sonicated 5 times for 10 s to obtain small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) . 1 . 5 µl of the SUV solution with a total lipid concentration of 0 . 1 mg ml – 1 was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica to form SLBs through vesicle fusion . Using HS - AFM , the process of bilayer formation could directly be observed . The excess lipids , after SLB formation , were rinsed with the same buffer . 1 . 5 µl of 1 . 5 µM A5 was deposited on the lipid bilayer and incubated for 10 min with observation buffer 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM CaCl 2 followed by rinsing . Alternatively A5 was added through the buffer exchange pump system . Ca 2 + uncaging experiments . In the Ca 2 + uncaging experiments , the observation buffercontained 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 4 . 5 mM CaCl 2 and 5 mM DM - nitrophen . The ensemble of 4 . 5 mM CaCl 2 and 5 mM DM - nitrophen forms 4 . 5 mM caged Ca 2 + , the slight excess of DM - nitrophen assures complete Ca 2 + chelation . DM - nitrophen ( Merck Millipore ) has a dissociation constant K d = 5 nM ( with K d = [ DM - nitrophen ] [ Ca 2 + ] / [ DM - nitrophen − Ca 2 + ] ) to Ca 2 + , but on UV irradiation the af ﬁ nity to Ca 2 + is dramatically reduced , leading to release of Ca 2 + with a time constant of ∼ 100 µs . For UV mediated Ca 2 + uncaging , a pulsed UV laser was used , with a wavelength of 349 nm , a beam diameter of 0 . 15 mm ±10 % , a pulse frequency and energy of 5 kHz and about 0 . 1 µJ , respectively . Data analysis . The HS - AFM movies were drift corrected , contrast adjusted and the non - p 6 trimer rotation analysis performed by a laboratory built image analysis software in ImageJ 23 , 25 . Structure modelling . The surface representation of the atomic A5 structure ( PDB 1ALA ) was cross - correlated against the high - resolution AFM topography to determine the x and y coordinates and rotational angles of the molecules within the lattice . The threefold symmetry axis of A5 was assumed to be perpendicular to the membrane plane in average and the Ca 2 + coordinating protein face was assumed to be membrane associated . We further used knowledge of the p 6 lattice arrangement , in agreement with previous EM studies 14 , to set the unit cell distances a and b as equal and the rotational alignmentofthe six trimers forming the honeycomb pattern to integer multiples of 60° . Molecular dynamics simulations . The molecular assembly consisted of an A5 homotrimer lying at the surface of a lipid bilayer formed by 84 dioleyl - phosphatidylserine ( DOPS ) and 336 dioleyl - phosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) molecules in equilibrium with 38 , 644 water molecules , corresponding to a cell dimension ofabout 118 ×118×133 Å 3 . First , the solution was buffered with calcium chloride at a concentration of about 125 mM . To simulate annexin trimer unbinding , the initial molecular assembly consisted of the annexin trimer lying on the DOPC : DOPS lipid bilayer , in equilibrium with 54 , 248 water molecules , corresponding to a larger cell dimension of about 118×118 ×172 Å 3 , and all calcium ions were removed to mimic the effect of the sequestrant and sodium ions were introduced to ensure electric neutrality of the cell . All of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the parallel , scalable program NAMD 26 with the CHARMM 36 force - ﬁ eld and the TIP3P water model 27 , 28 . Lipid head - groups and lipid aliphatic tails were described , respectively , with an all - atom and a united - atom potential energy function . A Lowe – Andersen thermostat was used to control the temperature at 303 K , and the pressure was maintained at 1 atm by employing the Langevin piston method 29 . Covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to their equilibrium length by means of the SHAKE / RATTLE algorithm , except for water molecules , for which the SETTLE algorithm was applied 30 . Long - range electrostatic forces were evaluated using the particle - mesh Ewald scheme , whereas a smoothed 9 Å spherical cut - off was used to truncate short - range van der Waals and electrostatic interactions . The r - RESPA multiple time - step algorithm was applied to integrate the equations of motion with a time step of 2 fs and 4 fs for short - and long - range interactions . References 24 .
