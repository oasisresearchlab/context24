In contrast with this perceived complexity , some recent papers from the discipline of physics suggests that irreproducibility does not point to a systemic crisis , but is , on the contrary , a sign that the science system works properly . These works , while acknowledging the difference between physics and other disciplines mired in the reproducibility crisis , hint that all disciplines could learn from Physics . The present work suggests that this optimistic message , when addressed to struggling disciplines , may invite complacency over other relevant dimensions of crisis , delay its solution , and get into the way of a truly joint effort from all disciplines to tackle the important social and environmental predicaments of the present age . Keywords : Science’s crisis , reproducibility , irreproducibility , scientific controversies , science’ ethics Context The present work intersects two relevant issue in today’s governance of science . One is science’s reproducibility crisis and its perception among different stakeholders . Another is the relation between disciplines , and more broadly between social sciences and humanities on one side and the natural sciences on the other . While copious ink has been poured over these two issues – each of them is conflicted in its own separate way . Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 2 As per the crisis in science , a tension exists among those who point to its systemic nature , e . g . ( Ravetz 2011 ; Saltelli and Funtowicz 2017 ; Saltelli 2018 ) and those who dismiss it as minor or non - existent , e . g . ( Fanelli 2018b ; 2018a ; Jamieson 2018 ) . Elements of the crisis are seen by some as systemic , and hence of arduous solutions ( Smaldino and McElreath 2016 ; Edwards and Roy 2017 ) . If the crisis will be worse before it can become better ( Saltelli 2017 ) , it will remain the occasion for political battles where powerful interests mobilize the crisis e . g . against environmental regulations ( Wood and Randall 2018 ; Saltelli 2018 ; Oreskes 2018 ) , exacerbating present fights around ecological and health issues . The concern expressed by such considerations prompted efforts to separate the definition of reproducibility ( obtaining consistent results when using the same data and analysis methods ) and replicability ( obtaining consistent results , using new data and similar analysis methods ) in order to achieve progress towards the solution of the problem ( National Academies of Sciences 2019 ) . The conflicted relationship between humanities and social sciences on one hand and natural sciences on the other , from the age of Descartes to our days , has been framed by Toulmin as a conflict between the values of Renaissance and those of Enlightenment ( Toulmin 1992 ; 2001 ) . For others , modernity is marred by the persistence of a Cartesian dream of domination and control of nature made possible by mathematics , technology and the sciences ( Pereira and Funtowicz 2015 ; Scoones and Stirling 2020 ) . Culture wars , officially started in the eighties , can be seen alive and well in the present ( Frodeman 2020 ) , becoming the occasion for periodic calls for abating disciplinary barriers when new crises , such as the present pandemic , would call for a joint effort from all disciplines in a dialogic relation with one another ( Cummings et al . 2020 ; Waltner - Toews et al . 2020 ; Saltelli et al . 2020 ) . A superposition of the narratives and debates about the nature of the present so - called reproducibility crisis and the relation between disciplines offers the occasion for some new insights , which are illustrated in the present work . We focus on the role of physics , and how physics perceives and is perceived in the context of the crisis . There is a broad agreement among several scholars that , among natural scientists , physicists hold a primacy of virtue when it comes to the diligent execution of experiments and the reproducibility of their results ( Fanelli 2010 ; Nuzzo 2015 ) . A research question tackled in the present work is if the acknowledged prominence and status of the discipline of physics might favour general complacency towards cases of irreproducibility and / or replicability and if this Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 3 were to be the case , what would be the implication for science , policy and society overall . The discussion moves from a relevant episode which is illustrated next . The case A recent article in Nature Physics suggests that “Lack of reproducibility is not necessarily bad news ; it may herald new discoveries and signal scientific progress” ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ) . The same piece is taken up in an editorial on Nature titled “Irreproducibility is not a sign of failure , but an inspiration for fresh ideas” ( Editorial 2020 ) . In these two pieces the case for the usefulness of irreproducibility is constructed with examples coming from Physics , its metrology to be precise , and concerning three among the most important universal constants : Plank’s h , the speed of light c , and gravitation’s G . Here successive determinations – albeit amidst difficulty , gently converge toward more and more precise determinations . The first piece tends to give emphasis to the following narrative : irreproducibility is the occasion for the metrology community to improve on existing measures . The second paper uses the first to emphasize the narrative that makes irreproducibility a useful part of the scientific process . Both suggest that the practice of metrology can be an example for other disciplines to adopt . The critique Our critique of ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ; Editorial 2020 ) addresses the hidden / underlying assumptions being made as well as the inferences derived by the authors . The first underlying assumption is that the sources of non - reproducibility and of non - replicability are overwhelmingly , if not all , technical , and ultimately helpful to advance science . However , any instance of non - replicability generally requires further investigation to ascertain the nature of such sources : some are helpful new “unknown effects or sources of variability” , while others range from “simple mistakes to methodological errors to bias and fraud” [ NASEM report 2020 ] ) . Such sources are additionally different in quality and intensity , depending on the subject being investigated . The second underlying ( but not explicit ) assumption that is given credit by ( Editorial 2020 ) , building on ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ) , is that the examples put forward by ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ) can be extended to other disciplines in terms of convergence towards an accepted value . Such assumption is at odds with intrinsic differences between disciplines : different subjects of Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 4 investigation lend themselves to different sources of irreproducibility or non - replicability and an approach developed in one subject may not be applicable to all . In light of the generally different sources of non - reproducibility and non - replicability , it is then generally accepted that the difficulties in reproducibility and replicability are comparably less serious in physics then they are in other scientific fields ( Nuzzo 2015 ) : not just in biomedical and social sciences as noted in Nature ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ) , or in psychology as noted in Nature Physics ( Editorial 2020 ) , but in practically all scientific fields from criminology to nutrition , from organic chemistry to applied economics ( Saltelli and Funtowicz 2017 ) . Biomedicine stands out as a field of extreme relevance where the situation of poor reproducibility is mostly evident ( Harris 2017 ; Begley and Ellis 2012 ; 2012 ) . This is particularly serious when the world is in the midst of a pandemic and when the speed of deployment of new and existing vaccines and cures contends with the speed of insurgence of new variants of the virus . As per reproducibility and replicability , when it comes to large meta - analyses , such as - in medicine , those run under the flagship of Cochrane , the performance of medicine and physics are not all that different . As noted in ( Bailey 2017 ) “medical research uncertainties are generally as well evaluated as those in physics , but physics uncertainty improves more rapidly . ” On the other hand it is evident that the examples from metrology presented in ( Editorial 2020 ) offers little insight to orient a research in the design of a medical trial , or in studying the properties of an hydrogeological basin . What about the analysis of wage settings in economics , of regulatory capture in political sciences , or of performative properties of numbers in sociology of quantification ? Even remaining in the domain of natural sciences , autopoietic living systems need their own specific methods ( Louie 2010 ) . Particle physics is much less affected by disputed values , societally high stakes and the need for urgent decisions ( Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993 ) , when compared e . g . with the developments of biomedicine for COVID - 19 or cancer . Thus , the use of examples from one discipline to build a general narrative has a large potential for overlooking systemic differences . Is the solution hinted to by some member of the community of physics and metrology ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ; Editorial 2020 ) that all fields become more like physics ? Given the limitations of the underlying assumptions , such course would most probably be a problem , rather than a solution , as noted by those who lament the mathematization of economics Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 5 ( Mirowski 1991 ; Reinert 2000 ; Drechsler 2000 ; Romer 2015 ) , the use of statistical rituals in sociology ( Gigerenzer and Marewski 2014 ) or more radically object to a “quantitative - mathematical social science” ( Drechsler 2004 ) . Typically , unhelpful sources of non - reproducibility that are present in other fields are , de facto , absent or reduced in Physics . While the hypothesis that G could change with time is still an active field of research ( Uzan 2011 ) , this is rather an exception in physics , while change is the only constant in other disciplines . Modern physics is ordinarily spared serious methodological error such as fighting breast cancer for decades using the wrong cell line ( ( Harris 2017 ) , p . 99 - 105 ) . One would need to go back to XVIII century’s phlogiston or XIX century’s luminoferous aether to find equivalent examples in physics . Physics has no space for the political tensions associated to measuring unemployment , inequality or poverty ( Concialdi 2014 ) . The difficulty to ascertain at the beginning of the pandemic even the most basic parameters of the COVID crisis creates a situation of untamed uncertainty which is considerably less common in physics ( Daston 2020 ) . Beyond the evident differences between physics and other fields , the crisis of science has many dimensions , and constraining extant problems under the heading of reproducibility risks serious misrepresenting the issue , offering too reassuring an image of science’s health ( Saltelli and Funtowicz 2017 ; Saltelli 2018 ; Saltelli and Boulanger 2019 ) . A possible taxonomy of science’s pains ( Ravetz 2016 ) could include :  Methodological and epistemological , as in the crisis of reproducibility proper ( Ioannidis 2005 ; Begley and Ellis 2012 ; Open Science Collaboration ( OSC ) 2015 ) , and in the convulsions of statistics ( Amrhein , Greenland , and McShane 2019 ; Gelman 2019 ; Mayo 2018 ) ;  Ethical , in the relationship between the crisis and a perverse system of incentives ( Smaldino and McElreath 2016 ; Edwards and Roy 2017 ) ;  Political , in that the crisis itself become the theatre of conflict between industrial and corporate interests and regulators , whereby the former claim that the science of the latter is irreproducible and should hence be repelled ( Saltelli 2018 ; Oreskes 2018 ) ; here the principle of evidence based policy becomes hijacked by those who have the means to produce and enforce their evidence ( Ioannidis 2016 ; Saltelli and Giampietro 2017 ; Saltelli 2018 ; Saltelli et al . 2021 ) . Science as a marketplace of ideas favours the actors who have in the market their natural habitat ( Mirowski 2011 ) ; in this context science becomes itself Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 6 both victim and perpetrators of processes of regulatory capture fought by corporate interests in the name of ‘sound science’ ( Michaels 2008 ; Saltelli et al . 2021 ) ;  Ethico - political , in that science is used in the place of religion as a source of legitimization of power ( Lyotard 1979 ; Ravetz 1990 ; Toulmin 1992 ) ;  Systemic , when science’s politicization , mediatization and commoditization are simultaneously at play and the intrinsic code of communication of science as a social system ( true / false ) is substituted by ( profit / loss ) or ( news / no - news ) ( Saltelli and Boulanger 2019 ) . Is irreproducibility “a sign of the scientific method at work” ( Milton and Possolo 2020 ; Editorial 2020 ) or the most visible symptom of these other dimensions ? While keeping disciplines like physics and metrology and their achievements in due respect , they should not be used to dismiss the seriousness of science’s problems nor to deny the reproducibility challenge itself . This would not help all those – from statisticians to medical researchers , engaged to tackle the different aspects of this crisis ( Ioannidis 2017 ; Open Science Collaboration ( OSC ) 2015 ; National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine 2020 ) . From the specific case to the underlying narratives As discussed , a possible aspect of the case just tackled is complacency . On the one hand the seriousness of the problem of reproducibility is discounted . On the other , some members of the physics community tend to look to their colleagues in fields such as medical or social sciences with what appears to be an attitude of intellectual aloofness : if we can experiment properly , why cannot you ? This is what one might call a minor incident , a sort of disciplinary venial sin . Yet this calls to mind – and perhaps belongs to - a constellation of various aspects of science qua science , and of science in relation to society .  Is complacency , the long wave of the science wars ? The Sokal affair in the eighties was meant to ‘prove’ that social scientists could not detect the vacuity of a paper discussing the hermeneutics of quantum gravity . More recently , the hoax on grievance studies ( Pluckrose , Lindsay , and Boghossian 2018 ) , aptly named Sokal - squared , suggested that cultural theory scholars cannot detect the hoax in ‘rapist dogs’ – one of the articles used in the ruse . If this is the case , these scientists deserve condescending help from more mature disciplines . Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 7  More than between science and humanities ( Snow 1959 ) , the conflict is between different scientific tribes . For example chapter nine of Postman’s Technopolis ( Postman 1992 ) contains a severe reprimand of the practices of social scientists , while the more recent work of Steven Pinker ( Pinker 2018 ) moves ( Chapter 22 ) an even more unceremonious attack to social sciences and humanities . For ( Crowe 1969 ) there exist two “insular scientific communities - the natural and the social - between which there is very little communication and a great deal of envy , suspicion , disdain , and competition for scarce resources” . For Crowe , this insularity gets into the way of science saving the commons , which is the point made in the present work in relation to the urgent challenges facing humanity .  Should the aspiration to a greater good for science lead the scientific community at large to accept the discounting of the crisis favoured in some quarters as a defensive move to protect science’s workings and funding ? Or simply to protect one positive ( or positivistic ) vision of science against one that looks at the present political economy of science ( Mirowski 2020 ) ?  For Clifford D . Conner ( Conner 2005 ) , physicists have for a long time belittled disciplines as botany or palaeontology by likening them to stamp collecting . Thus , argues Conner , while the methodologies of biology , anthropology , ecology , psychology and sociology have little in common with that of theoretical physics , physics is placed on a pedestal by the ideology of modern science – an example that all disciplines should strive to emulate . For the same author the imperialism of physics – which was boosted by physicists’ role in the Second World War - had important consequences for the other disciplines , including foremost the one that science overall must be ‘value free’ , and ‘neutral’ , a move that would force the social sciences away from their critical role and support the status quo ( Conner 2005 ) . Note that the argument just developed for physics has been made to draw attention to the performative , non - neutral , role of mathematics as an element of education and regimentation ( Ernest 2018 ) – and we say that not to distract from our subject , physics , but to contest – as many before us , ideas of neutrality cherished by a positivistic vision of science .  Today the challenge to social sciences is more effectively run by evolutionary and cognitive psychologists . If evolutionary psychology can explain all human habits and practices , who needs sociology ( Foucart , Horel , and Laurens 2020 ) ? If consumers and Physics to the rescue ? by Saltelli et al , 2021 8 voters can be effectively domesticated by cognitive psychology coupled with artificial intelligence ( Zuboff 2019 ) , politologists and sociologists are no longer needed . Concluding remarks In some field of physics discrepancies in measurement – known as anomalies , and often related to the validity of the standard model , provide the bread and butter of research at the frontiers of knowledge ( Garisto 2020 ) . The pride of such colleagues for their achievements appears justified . After all , we all watch in awe the progress of ( particle ) physics , its bosons and gravitational waves , its flow of discoveries about the cosmos . Yet , as discussed in the present work , the ‘metrology for all’ or ‘physics to the rescue’ narratives are functional to a reductionist view of science overall . What some physicists perceive as a rather innocuous form of intellectual snobbism toward the less endowed colleagues in medical or social disciplines is in fact a dangerous affliction of the science system , one which makes science more vulnerable to the convulsions of the present crisis ( Saltelli and Funtowicz 2017 ; Saltelli 2018 ) . While taking in due account physicists ' experience in the measurement of fundamental constants , this has relative utility to tackle a situation where science ' s own quality control apparatus appears challenged . Such a crisis , long predicted ( de Solla Price 1963 ; Ravetz 1971 ) has surely a vast array of technical solution , but an even broader array of social ones ( Smaldino and McElreath 2016 ; Edwards and Roy 2017 ) . Science is a social activity ( Ravetz 1971 ) , and the solution of its problems – linked to those of policy and society – may need a new covenant between science and society in the direction of more participative approaches to deliberation ( Waltner - Toews et al . 2020 ) , more than it needs a hierarchical vision of the disciplines of science with physics at the top . Otherwise said , science’s role in saving the commons ( Crowe 1969 ) calls for a humbler attitude ( Jasanoff 2003 ) , from all disciplines , including physics .
