HS1 is a multidomain protein that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to promote the polymerization of branched actin . It is the immune system paralogue of cortactin , a ubiquitous protein impli - cated in cell migration , endocytosis and invasion of host cells by many bacterial pathogens . HS1 in some ways substitutes for cortactin in the immune system . For example , it par - ticipates in cell migration by helping assemble specific actin structures , such as podosomes in dendritic cells . At the same time , HS1 plays several roles in the immune system that its cortactin paralogue does not . Not only does HS1 act downstream of T - and B - cell receptors to promote actin polymerization but it also acts down - stream of the Fc ε RI in mast cells and it assists natural killer cells in form - ing the lytic immunological synapse . Since its discovery in the late 1980s , HS1 has gradually been implicated in diverse pathological conditions of the immune system , including leu - kaemia , lupus and severe congeni - tal neutropenia . The present review summarizes the current knowledge of HS1 regulation and participation in molecular complexes , focusing on key aspects of HS1 in immunological disease . Conclusion Much of what has been learnt from cortactin can be applied to HS1 and vice versa . This may prove helpful for shedding light on the many aspects of HS1 regulation and signalling , which remain unknown . Nevertheless , despite their simi - larities , cortactin and HS1 are dif - ferent proteins with functions that do not entirely overlap . For example , structural differences between the proteins may explain some immune - specific functions of HS1 . Future work should seek to establish wheth - er HS1 helps bacterial and viral path - ogens evade the immune system , and investigate how the protein functions during normal and pathological im - mune responses . Introduction In 1989 , researchers described a new human protein expressed in lymphoid , myeloid and erythroblas - toid cell lines , as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes , granulocytes and macrophages . However , it was not detected in non - haematopoietic tissues and so was named haemat - opoietic lineage cell - specific protein 1 ( HS1 ) 1 . Soon afterwards , its gene was mapped to human chromosome 3q13 and it was identified as a sub - strate of Lyn kinase 2 . As a result , HS1 is sometimes referred to as haemat - opoietic cell - specific Lyn substrate 1 ( HCLS1 ) . The ubiquitous paralogue of HS1 is cortactin , encoded by the CTTN gene ( formerly EMS1 ) , which is located in a chromosomal region frequently amplified in human carcinomas 3 . Like cortactin , HS1 promotes actin polym - erization by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex ; in this way , it participates in multiple processes that remodel the actin cytoskeleton , including im - munological synapse formation , cell adhesion and migration 4 . Cortactin was initially described as a cytoskel - etal protein and a major substrate of Src kinase in studies conducted in chicken embryonic fibroblasts 5 . Therefore , investigators have as - sumed that HS1 and cortactin show mutually exclusive expression pat - terns . However , this has never been tested in depth . Such expression analysis is particularly important for immune system studies , since HS1 is generally assumed to play the role of cortactin in immune cells 6 . Although pathogens exploit cort - actin for adhesion , invasion and im - mune avoidance 7 , no evidence yet exists that pathogens take advantage of HS1 in a similar manner . Clearly , fundamental aspects of HS1 ex - pression and regulation remain un - known , and this poses a problem for gaining deeper insights into immune function . The aim of this review is fo - cused on the emerging roles of HS1 in the immune system . Discussion The author has referenced some of its own studies in this review . The protocols of these studies have been approved by the relevant ethics committees related to the institution in which they were performed . Domain organization of HS1 HS1 is a multidomain protein that participates in several cytoskeleton rearrangement processes . HS1 has an N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) domain that directly binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex ; in this way , HS1 behaves as a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) 8 . According to the cur - rent model for actin polymerization , * Corresponding author Email : narcisa - quiles @ med . ucm . es Immunology Division , Microbiology I De - partment .

WASP and N - WASP are co - expressed in some cell types , such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( DCs ) . These proteins make up a special class of NPFs called class I NPFs ; they bind G - actin and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through an acidic VCA domain . In recent years , many other class I NPFs have been described , including WAVE / Scar - related proteins 12 . In contrast to class I NPFs , HS1 and cortactin are considered ‘weak’ activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro , which raises the question of whether they must undergo post - translational modifications or form complexes with other proteins in order to become fully active . It is also possible that they influence ac - tin remodelling indirectly , by acting through another NPF . In support of this idea , cortactin can indirectly pro - mote actin nucleation by activating N - WASP in vitro 13 . Whether HS1 can activate WASP in a similar fashion is unknown . HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation HS1 contains 486 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 54 kDa . However , it migrates as a single major band of 75 kDa on SDS - PAGE . This strongly suggests the presence of post - trans - lational modifications , which may regulate HS1 activity . Indeed , stud - ies have shown that several tyros - ines in HS1 are phosphorylated by non - receptor - type tyrosine kinases of the Src family . The major Src fam - ily kinases ( SFKs ) are c - Src , c - Yes , Fyn , c - Fgr , Lyn , Hck , Lck and Blk . These eight proteins are activated in concert with transmembrane re - ceptors such as integrins , growth factor receptors ( GFRs ) and im - mune cell receptors like the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) and B - cell receptor ( BCR ) . In this way , SFKs regulate a wide range of cellular processes , including cell growth and differen - tiation , survival , cell adhesion and migration 14 . amino acids , followed in turn by a coiled - coil ( CC ) region . The repeats and CC region bind synergistically to F - actin 11 ( Figure 1 ) . Cortactin , in con - trast , has six and a half repeats , the fourth of which is required to bind to F - actin and contribute to cortactin activity . The C - terminus of HS1 con - tains an SH3 domain highly homolo - gous to the one in cortactin . Numerous other proteins also act as NPFs , but they activate Arp2 / 3 by a different mechanism from that of cortactin / HS1 . Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome proteins ( WASPs ) are an important example . The canonical member of the family , named WASP , is expressed exclusively in the immune system , and mutation of its gene leads to an immune deficiency called WAS . A ubiquitous member of the family is globular monomeric actin ( G - actin ) assembles into filamentous actin ( F - actin ) . The dimeric or trimeric nucleus that initially forms is un - stable ; so further polymerization is promoted and controlled by facilita - tor proteins . One such protein is the Arp2 / 3 complex , a seven - membered complex comprising actin - related proteins 2 and 3 , as well as five oth - er subunits . This complex is able to add a ‘branch’ to the side of a pre - existing actin filament , giving rise to branched filaments with a charac - teristic 70 - degree angle 9 , 10 . Cortactin and HS1 appear to bind and acti - vate the Arp2 / 3 complex in similar ways , so they are usually considered members of the same NPF family . The NTA domain of HS1 is followed by three and a half tandem repeats of Figure 1 : Cortactin and HS1 proteins . The domain organization , post - translational modifications and interacting partners of both proteins are shown .

The same study has shown that plas - macytoma cell lines do not express HS1 , suggesting that terminally dif - ferentiated plasma cells express cort - actin but not HS1 24 . The field is wide open for studies to explore these and other questions in detail . HS1 and T cells Murine HS1 was cloned and charac - terized as part of screening for pro - teins that bind to the SH3 domain of Lck kinase in T cells , hence its name LckBP1 25 . The murine gene was mapped to a region in chromosome 16 that is syntenic ( functionally equivalent ) to human chromosome 3q 26 . Both of these studies found that HS1 is tyrosine phosphorylated after TCR stimulation in murine cells . In Jurkat T cells , however , HS1 tyros - ine phosphorylation was induced in response to CD3 engagement ( TCR activation ) but not in response to CD28 or CD2 engagement 27 . A decade after the first studies of HS1 in T - cell signalling , investiga - tors explored in depth the role of HS1 during the formation of the im - munological synapse 28 . Those stud - ies showed that , upon TCR ligation , HS1 - deficient T cells fail to produce a well - organized and stable F - actin as - sembly at the immune synapse . HS1 is required for Ca 2 + mobilization and for IL - 2 gene transcription , which is accompanied by defects in activation of NF - AT and NF - κ B signalling . Sup - pressing HS1 expression in T cells still allows the exchange factor Vav1 to be recruited to the immunological synapse , but it inhibits Vav1 reten - tion there . Therefore , HS1 has been proposed to stabilize the immuno - logical synapse and promote Vav1 retention there . In vitro pull - down assays per - formed with isolated SH2 domains indicate that HS1 binds to the SH2 domain in Lck , phospholipase C Interestingly , Ser / Thr phosphoryla - tion of HS1 potentiates subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation 21 . HS1 knockout mouse model HS1 knockout mice show normal development of major lymphoid cell subpopulations ; numbers of CD4 - and CD8 - positive T cells are normal , although negative selection in the thymus is partially impaired . Numbers of B cells are also normal , although production of antibodies against T - independent antigens is reduced . The mice show impaired proliferation of splenic B and T cells following cross - linking of antigen re - ceptors . These results indicate that HS1 plays critical roles in antigen receptor - mediated signalling 22 . More recent studies have identified a pro - found myeloproliferative block ( see Neutropenia ) . Further studies of this knockout mouse will undoubtedly advance our understanding of HS1 functions . HS1 and B cells When the BCR binds specific antigen , B cells respond by ( i ) differentiat - ing into plasmocytes or plasma cells , which then generate antibodies and ( ii ) generating long - lived memory cells , thereby contributing to a pro - tective adaptive immune response . After cross - linking of membrane - bound IgM , HS1 is tyrosine phospho - rylated and associates with the SFK Lyn 23 . In fact , Lyn and Syk kinases have been shown to synergistically phosphorylate HS1 , principally on ty - rosines 378 and 397 24 . These findings strongly suggest that HS1 plays im - portant roles during the activation of B cells . Consistent with this idea , low expression of HS1 correlates with re - sistance to BCR - induced apoptosis 23 . Many questions remain about the involvement of HS1 in the B - cell - mediated immune response . One study has identified HS1 in the nu - cleus , raising the possibility that the protein mediates BCR - dependent changes in gene expression 24 . In fact , It appears that HS1 is regulated not only by single phosphorylation events but also by sequential phos - phorylation 15 . Such sequential phos - phorylation may be catalysed by spleen tyrosine kinase ( Syk ) , a mem - ber of the Zeta - associated protein of the 70 - kDa ( Zap70 ) kinase family , as well as by an SFK acting in concert with other kinases . The proposed mechanism is that Syk phosphoryl - ates tyrosine 397 , creating a dock - ing site for the SH2 domain of SFKs , which then further phosphorylate the protein ( Figure 1 ) . Cortactin was the first member of its NPF family to be described as a substrate of the Abelson ( Abl ) and Abl - related gene ( Arg ) non - receptor kinases ( Abl / Arg family kinases ) ; this phosphorylation plays an im - portant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton 16 . More recent work has shown that HS1 interacts with Abl ki - nase during immune synapse forma - tion 17 ( see HS1 and T cells ) . Cortactin is regulated by reversible acetylation of lysines , and the SH3 domain of HS1 binds preferentially to lysine and proline - rich motifs 18 . This suggests that HS1 may also be structurally regulated by acetylation . We have recently described a compe - tition between acetylation and tyros - ine phosphorylation of cortactin and that phosphorylation inhibits cell spreading 19 . In addition , work by our group 19 and others 20 has recently de - scribed the participation of cortactin and focal adhesion kinase in regulat - ing focal adhesion turnover . This sug - gests that in the near future , HS1 will also be further implicated in integrin signalling . HS1 serine / threonine phosphorylation In platelets , casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) was shown to phosphorylate ser - ines and threonines in HS1 . Mapping studies showed that phosphorylation occurs primarily at threonines in the N - terminal region and at serines in the central core of the molecule .

In fact , HS1 has already been implicated in diverse patho - logical conditions . Nevertheless , HS1 mutations associated with human immune deficiency have yet to be described , and this seems likely to come in the future . Lupus Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by hyperactivation of autoreactive immune cells . In a study of Japanese woman with SLE , a mu - tant HS1 protein was identified with a 37 - residue deletion caused by exon skipping 37 . The resulting protein lacked the third repeat downstream of the NTA domain . Additional poly - morphisms in HS1 have been associ - ated with SLE 38 . Investigators have proposed that all these mutations lead to a hyperactive protein , but this must be tested in structural and bio - chemical studies . Leukaemia HS1 is an important actin regulatory protein participating in BCR signal - ling ( see HS1 and B cells ) , raising the possibility that its malfunction is linked with cancer such as B - cell - de - rived leukaemia . While early studies hypothesized that cortactin expres - sion is associated with plasma cell transformation 39 , pioneering work from the Caligaris - Cappio laboratory in Italy has implicated HS1 in chron - ic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) 40 . Their studies indicate that in CLL patients with poor prognosis , most HS1 is constitutively phosphorylated , whereas only a fraction is phospho - rylated in patients with good prog - nosis . BCR stimulation increases the levels of phosphorylated HS1 in nor - mal mature B cells and memory B cells above those in naïve B cells . More recent studies have shown that eliminating HS1 expression in B cells impairs cytoskeletal re - modelling , leading to abnormal cell on tyrosines 378 and 397 in natu - ral killer cells , one study elegantly analysed actin accumulation at the immunological synapse , target cell lysis , adhesion and chemotaxis 35 . The results showed that the phospho - rylation of tyrosine 378 is required for chemotaxis . Phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 , in contrast , primarily influences adhesion processes : it is required for adhesion to the integrin ligand ICAM - 1 , for recruitment of in - tegrins , adaptors to the lytic synapse and for actin polymerization . HS1 and dendritic cells DCs patrol the body in search of path - ogens that they can present to other immune cells . In addition to acting as professional antigen - presenting cells , they regulate the immune re - sponse in important ways . They can migrate using several actin - contain - ing structures , including podosomes . DCs from HS1 knockout mice form podosomes with aberrant morphol - ogy and distribution on the ventral cell surface . Intriguingly , recruit - ment of HS1 to podosomes requires the activity of a protein complex that includes WASP and Wiskott – Aldrich protein - interacting protein ( WIP ) . Since both WASP and HS1 are NPFs that stimulate actin polymerization ( see Domain organization of HS1 ) , it is tempting to speculate that they col - laborate to support actin - dependent processes in DCs . However , WASP - deficient DCs show a migration phe - notype different from HS1 - deficient DCs . Although both cell types show reduced directional persistence , WASP - deficient cells move more slowly than wild - type DCs , whereas HS1 - deficient cells move faster 36 . This suggests that WASP and HS1 perform complementary functions in DCs . HS1 in immunological diseases Since HS1 is widely expressed in im - mune cells and participates in diverse signalling pathways , as outlined in the sections above , it seems likely gamma 1 ( PLC γ 1 ) and Vav1 . Given that HS1 also interacts with Lck via its SH3 domain ( see HS1 and T cells ) , these findings suggest that HS1 and / or phospho - HS1 can form differ - ent molecular complexes in order to achieve signal specificity . Phospho - HS1 binds not only Lck but also c - Abl kinase through its SH2 domain , and this binding is required for full tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 via a pathway involving the WASP mem - ber WAVE2 17 . The complex picture emerging from these studies sug - gests that many questions remain about the participation of HS1 in TCR signalling . HS1 and erythrocytes , platelets and mast cells Lyn is a major SFK implicated in erythrocyte differentiation . Two hy - brid studies have shown that HS1 interacts directly via its proline - rich region with the SH3 domain of Lyn . Expressing truncated HS1 in the J2E erythroleukaemic cell line suppressed basal and erythropoie - tin - induced proliferation and differ - entiation 29 , clearly demonstrating the importance of HS1 for erythrocyte function . The picture is less clear in platelets 30 , 31 , due to the fact that cort - actin is also expressed in megakaryo - cytes and platelets 32 . In human mast cell cultures gener - ated by treating umbilical cord blood cells with recombinant human stem cell factor and IL - 6 , cross - linking of high - affinity Fc epsilon receptor I ( Fc ε RI ) induces histamine release and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates , in - cluding Syk and HS1 33 . Other studies in mast cells showed that Fer - CIP4 homology ( FCH ) – Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) and SH2 kinase ( Fes kinase ) phosphorylate C - terminal tyrosine residues in HS1 that are im - plicated in actin stabilization 34 . .

Identification and cloning HAX - 1 refers to a family of ubiqui - tously - expressed proteins , ranging in size from 26 to 35 kDa , which re - sult from complex alternative splic - ing events of a single HAX - 1 gene . The protein localizes predominantly to mitochondria , and to a lesser ex - tent to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane . The primary HAX - 1 function is mainly to regulate apoptosis , but it also contributes to cell migration 47 , 48 . HAX - 1 , together with HS1 , is a major regulator of my - eloid development and homeostasis , which may be due at least in part to the fact that HAX - 1 protects myeloid cells against apoptosis . After their seminal discovery that HAX - 1 is mutated in Kostmann dis - ease , the Welte laboratory explored the causes underlying neutropenia . They found that granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) promotes HS1 phosphorylation in myeloid cells . After stimulation by G - CSF , HS1 binds the transcription factor lymphoid - enhancer binding factor 1 ( LEF - 1 ) , and the LEF - 1 / HS1 complex translocates into the nucleus . This finding provides direct evidence for the nearly two - decade - old proposal 25 that HS1 is a transcriptional factor based on the presence of ‘helix - turn - helix’ motifs . Alterations in this sig - nalling pathway have been described in patients with severe congenital neutropenia 49 . The involvement of HS1 in neu - tropenia may not stop here . HS1 has been shown to localize to the leading edge of migrating neutrophils during their chemotactic response to for - myl - Met - Leu - Phe ( fMLP ) , a process involving RacGTPase . This localiza - tion appears to require phosphoryla - tion at tyrosines 222 , 378 and 397 50 . Conclusion Despite their similarities , cortactin and HS1 are different proteins with functions that do not entirely overlap . For example , structural differences between the proteins may explain some immune - specific functions of adhesion and reduced cell migration . In one set of experiments , B cells were taken from CLL patients and HS1 expression was silenced ; when the cells were injected into immune - deficient mice , they infiltrated organs to a lesser extent than did wild - type cells 41 . These findings suggest that HS1 helps control the lymphocyte trafficking necessary for tissue inva - sion by malignant B cells in CLL . In CLL involving B cells , Lyn kinase is overexpressed and forms complex - es in the cytosol with HS1 . Recent work has shown that signalling by these Lyn / HS1 complexes promotes leukemic cell survival . In addition , HS1 has been detected in the nucleus of neoplastic B cells . These findings point to HS1 as a potential anticancer therapeutic target . Along these lines , it is intriguing that HS1 levels in ex vivo leukemic cells from patients re - sponsive to therapy with the purine analogue fludarabine are signifi - cantly lower than in nonresponsive patients 42 . HS1 has also been implicated in acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) . Patients with monocytic AML fre - quently have mutations in the gene encoding Fms - like tyrosine kinase 3 ( Flt3 ) . Ligands for this receptor act as growth factors for monocytic precursors . In ligand - dependent pro - liferation assays of AML monocytes , both HS1 and the serine - threonine kinase Pak1 / 2 were found to be phosphorylated 43 . Neutropenia In 1956 , Dr . Rolf Kostmann described a hereditary chronic neutropenia he called ‘infantile agranulocytosis’ , which was later termed ‘Kostmann disease’ 44 . Nearly 50 years passed before homozygous mutations in the gene encoding HCLS1 - associated X1 ( HAX - 1 ) were found in affected in - dividuals , including members of the original pedigree used in Kostmann’s work 45 . HAX - 1 had previously been identified and cloned in yeast two - hybrid screening using HS1 as bait 46 . Page 6 of 7 Review Licensee OA Publishing London 2013 .
