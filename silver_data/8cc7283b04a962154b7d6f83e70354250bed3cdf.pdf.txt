Sneddon’s , Hertzian , and Johnson – Kendall – Roberts theories of elastic contacts were tested for a variety of polymeric materials with Young’s modulus ranging from 1 MPa to 5 GPa . Results of these calculations were compared with a Sneddon’s slope analysis widely used for hard materials . It was demonstrated that the Sneddon’s slope analysis was ambiguous for polymeric materials . On the other hand , all models of elastic contact allowed probing depth proﬁle of elastic properties with nanometre scale resolutions . The models gave consistent values of elastic moduli for indentation depth up to 200 nm with lateral resolution better 100 nm for most polymeric materials .

Introduction Probing of local surface mechanical properties of vari - ous materials with a submicron resolution became a re - ality after the introduction of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and subsequent development in scanning force microscopy ( SFM ) technique [ 1 – 4 ] . However , to date , only a few attempts have been made to implement quan - titative nanoprobing of mechanical properties of com - pliant polymers [ 4 – 9 ] . These attempts were based on classic mechanical approaches developed for “hard” metal and semiconductor surfaces [ 10 – 15 ] . The overall slope of force – distance curve and Sneddon’s formula , were usually used for the treatment of SFM data [ 4 – 8 , 10 , 11 ] . However , this approach did not account for the speciﬁc features of compliant macromolecular materi - als such as very large indentation depth and viscoelastic behaviour . For quantitative nanoprobing of mechanical properties , the types of micromechanical deformation should be clariﬁed and appropriate models of elastic contact for compliant polymer solids should be tested . In the present communication , we report the results on micromechanical properties of polymeric materials based on classic theories of elastic contacts : Sneddon’s , Hertzian , and Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ( JKR ) [ 10 – 15 ] . These theories were tested for indentation depths from 2 to 200 nm and for sample Young’s modulus , E , from 1 MPa to 5 GPa and compared with a Sneddon’s slope analysis . ⁄ To whom correspondence should be addressed : fax 616 - 387 - 6517 , email vladimir @ wmich . edu . 2 . Experimental procedure The samples for investigation were selected to repre - sent a variety of polymeric materials with a wide range of elastic properties . Polyisoprene rubber ( Aldrich ) had a nominal Young’s modulus of 1 – 3 MPa [ 16 ] . Polyester - based Elastollan S60D53N and S69D53N polyurethanes ( PUs ) ( BASF ) and Dyreﬂex PT92004 PU ( Bayer ) had Young’s moduli in the range of 10 – 40 MPa . Polyvynilchloride ( PVC ) was Selectophore fromFlukawithYoung’smodulusintherange1 – 4 GPa . Polystyrene ( PS ) with M w D 250 000 and E D 2 – 5 GPa was obtained from Janssen Chimica . Smooth poly - mer ﬁlms of several micrometer thickness and several nanometre of surface microroughness were prepared by spin - coating technique ( Headway spin - coater ) . A combination of contact SFM mode in air and ﬂuid ( MilliQ water and absolute alcohol ) , and tapping and phase modes in air was used to characterize the poly - mer’s surfaces according to the well established proce - dure on the Dimension 3000 microscope [ 17 ] . We used a set of V - shaped cantilevers with spring constants , k n , of 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 58 , 2 . 9 and 47 N m ¡ 1 to probe poly - meric materials with very different elastic properties [ 18 ] . To estimate tip end radius , we scanned a refer - ence sample of mixed gold nanoparticles tethered to a self - assembled monolayer [ 18 ] . 3 . Results and discussion Typical force – distance curves used for calculation of elastic moduli are shown in Fig . 1 for rubber and Elastollan polyurethanes in water at 0 . 5 Hz approach – retract frequency . All curves obtained here are similar to 0022 – 2461 C (cid:176) 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers 4905 P1 : PNR / SNG P2 : PNR / RNT P3 : PNR / ATR QC : SDI 3072 - 98 November 20 , 1998 2 : 59 Figure 1 Force – distance data for the rubber sample ( a ) and for poly - urethane ( b ) in approaching - retracing cycle , force scale in nN with ar - bitrary zero level , distance is in nm with arbitrary zero point .

Linear approximation which can be used for Sneddon’s analysis are shown by straight lines for rubber sample . these ones and show jump - to - contact range , non - linear repulsive range in the approaching part , and pull - off range in the retracing part . First , we tested a popular approximation frequently used for analysis of indentation data and calculation of Young’s modulus from an overall slope of a force – distance curve by using the Sneddon’s formula [ 5 – 8 , 11 – 13 ] . The Sneddon’s model gives the relationship between load gradient , d P = d h , and Young’s modulus , E , in the form [ 13 ] d P d h D 2 A 1 = 2 … 1 = 2 E ( 1 ) where E D f [ ( 1 ¡ ” 21 ) = E 1 ] C [ ( 1 ¡ ” 22 ) = E 2 ] g ¡ 1 , com - posite elastic modulus ; E 1 , E 2 , ” 1 , ” 2 , Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratio of a material and an indentor , re - spectively ; P , normal load ; A , contact area ; and h , the indentation depth . By estimating d P = d h and contact area for speciﬁc shape of the indentor ( circular , pyra - midic , and parabolic ) one can evaluate elastic modu - lus from Equation 1 . Fig . 1a shows examples of the standard slope analysis applied to the force – distance data for rubber sample . According to these estimations , E D 3 . 6 MPa for rubber , 40 – 135 MPa for PUs , 250 MPa for PVC and 3 GPa for PS . These values are reasonable Figure 2 A double - spring model of elastic contact and major designa - tions used in this work : left , unloaded state ; right , loaded state . for materials studied and can be used as a rough esti - mation of elastic moduli as can be discussed below . To verify the applicability of different theories of elastic contact we used different approaches to analyse the repulsive force data from the contact point to the maximum indentation depth in the approaching mode for the rubber sample ( Fig . 1a ) . The equations for calculation of Young’s modulus from cantilever deﬂection can be derived by using a two - spring linear model of interacting cantilever spring and elastic surface ( Fig . 2 ) [ 7 , 8 ] . Conditions for quasi - static equilibrium for this model are presented as equal - ity of cantilever spring forces exerted and elastic surface response k n z deﬂ D P ( h ) ( 2 ) where P ( h ) is normal load as a function of vari - able indentation depth h D z pos ¡ z deﬂ , z deﬂ is a mea - sured vertical deﬂection of the SFM cantilever , z pos is the vertical displacement of the SFM piezoelement ( Fig . 2 ) . By using relationships between normal load P ( h ) and materials / indentation parameters offered in elastic contact models [ 10 , 20 , 21 ] , one can obtain analytical expressions of Young’s modulus for each model . For the polymer systems considered here , we as - sume E tip (cid:192) E polymer and , therefore , E D E polymer ( elas - tic modulus of silicon tip is 160 GPa versus 0 . 01 – 1 GPa for polymers ) [ 16 ] .

Derivation of Young’s modulus from the Hertzian model gives E D 3 ( 1 ¡ v 2 ) 4 k n R 1 = 2 z deﬂ h 3 = 2 ( 4 ) with JKR model giving E D 9 ( 1 ¡ v 2 ) 4 Rk n 1 (cid:181) P 1 3 Rh ¶ 3 = 2 ( 5 ) where P 1 D ( 3 P 2 ¡ 1 ) [ 9 ¡ 1 ( P 2 C 1 ) ] 1 = 3 , P 2 D ( z deﬂ = 1 C 1 ) 1 = 2 , and 1 is cantilever deﬂection at point where the tip loses contact with the surface [ 10 – 21 ] . To compare the results for various models , we used Sneddon’s , Hertzian , and JKR approaches to process force – distance data and calculate Young’s modulus at different penetration depth for rubber material ( Fig . 3 ) . Three immediate conclusions can be drawn from this data . First , at very low loads and small indentation depths less than 20 nm , unstable results are observed . Young’s modulus variation in this range depends criti - cally upon the selection of the initial contact point . We observed that variation of the initial point by § 2 nm can result in one order of magnitude variation of elas - tic modulus values at very small indentation depths . However , behaviour at larger indentation depth remains stable ( for more discussions see Ref . 22 ) . This phe - nomenon is known for the SFM cantilevers and is re - lated to the destabilizing attractive force gradient in the vicinity of surfaces [ 15 ] . Second , Young’s modulus for homogeneous poly - mers studied is independent of indentation depth and is virtually constant at the indentation depths larger than 20 nm ( beyond surface instabilities ) . This behaviour is expected for homopolymers studied here . The maxi - mum indentation depth for purely elastic deformation varies reciprocally to the elastic properties of materials from 200 nm for rubber to 20 nm for PS . Local con - tact pressure gradually increases with indentation depth Figure 4 Variation of local contact pressure and the contact radius for rubber sample calculated for the Hertzian model . as calculated using the Hertzian model and shown in Fig . 4 for rubber sample . The contact radius gradually increases with the normal load from up to 80 nm for rubber at maximum loads ( Fig . 4 ) . The contact radius at maximum loads decreases to 50 – 60 nm for PUs , and is only about 10 nm for hard PS . Third , all three approaches give convergent results and very close absolute values of Young’s modulus at indentation depths higher than 20 nm . Deviations of elastic modulus values obtained for the Sneddon’s pyra - midic model at very low indentation depth are related to the underestimation of the initial contact area . The Sneddon’s parabolic model gives virtually identical re - sults ( with higher scattering ) with the Hertzian model . On the other hand , the Hertzian model gives 25 % higher absolute value of elastic modulus as compared to JKR calculations . This difference is caused by non inclu - sion of the zero load contact area in the Hertzian model [ 20 – 21 ] . Next , we considered the limitations of sphere – plane models related to elastic deformations larger than sphere radius . We calculated the indentation depth ver - sus the normal load for Hertzian sphere – plane and cone – plane models ( Fig . 5 ) . As we concluded from the comparison with experimental data for rubber , the Hertzian model nicely describes experimental data at small indentation depths but deviates signiﬁcantly for h > 70 nm . Deviation reaches 10 % at h D 150 nm . On the other hand , for h > 80 nm , the cone – plane model describes experimental behaviour very closely ( Fig . 5 ) . Therefore , the sphere – plane model can be used in the range of indentation depth up to a diameter of the SFM tip ( h D 50 – 100 nm ) which is typical range of depths probed for elastomers . Larger indentation depths ( h > 2 R ) should be considered with caution and correc - tions must be included if precision better than 10 – 20 % is required . The Hertzian model was used to calculate the depth proﬁle of elastic moduli for a set of polymeric materi - als ( Fig . 6 ) . The experimental data is presented along with the bars representing range of Young’s modulus measured for bulk materials . This plot shows the very close correlation between the level of elastic moduli 4907 P1 : PNR / SNG P2 : PNR / RNT P3 : PNR / ATR QC : SDI 3072 - 98 November 20 , 1998 2 : 59 Figure 5 Variation of indentation depth versus load for sphere – plane ( squares ) and cone – plane ( triangles ) models in comparison with exper - imental data for rubber ( solid line ) . Figure 6 Summarized data for the depth variation of elastic modulus for rubber , two different PUs , PVC at high and low frequencies , and PS . Bars demonstrate the range of elastic bulk modulus variation for spe - ciﬁc materials ( frequency , molecular weight , composition dependent ) . Rhombic marks show the values of Young’s moduli determined from the Sneddon’s slope analysis . probed by SFM and mechanical properties of bulk ma - terials . The absolute values of elastic moduli vary by four orders of magnitude and ranging from 2 MPa for rubber to 5 GPa for PS . Absolute values determined from SFM measurements tend to be closer to the higher limit the Young’s moduli determined from tensile ex - periments as is expected for compression testing [ 23 ] . All data are shown here at 0 . 5 Hz frequency of con - tact . Additional measurements at various frequencies demonstrate very strong frequency dependence for var - ious polymeric materials as will be discussed in a sep - arate publication . As an example , we display two very different elastic modulus curves for PVC obtained at high ( 90 Hz ) and low ( 4 . 6 Hz ) frequencies ( Fig . 6 ) . Finally , we estimated the accuracy of a linear approx - imation for the Sneddon’s model ( Equation 1 ) . Direct comparison of elastic moduli obtained from modulus – depth curves in Fig . 6 with the slope analysis presented in Fig . 1 shows signiﬁcant differences in absolute values ( see data for comparison in Fig . 6 ) . Typical deviation of the slope analysis results from the complete calcu - lations according to Equations 2 – 5 is about 30 % but it can reach as much as 100 % in the case of signiﬁcant non - linearity of force – distance data and non - optimal cantilever stiffness ( e . g . for PUs or PS ) . 4 . Conclusions By combining optimal cantilever parameters and ex - perimental conditions we can obtain reliable force – distance data which is appropriate for further contact mechanics analysis for wide selection of polymeric materials with elastic moduli ranging from 1 MPa to several GPas . Both Sneddon’s and Hertzian models of elastic contact give consistent and reliable results in the range of indentation depth from 2 – 20 to 30 – 200 nm for different materials with lower limit dictated by surface instabilities and maximum depth determined by elastic deformation limit . The Hertzian model of elastic con - tact gives reliable absolute values of elastic modulus at given experimental conditions that eliminate strong capillary forces . The deviation is estimated to be about 25 % if compared with JKR model for very compliant materials , and is much smaller for harder polymers . Within this accuracy , the Hertzian model is applicable to a wide range of polymeric materials from rubbers to glassy polymers . However , obtaining higher preci - sion requires the employment of more complicated JKR model and measurements of local interfacial energies . This work is in progress . In spite of large elastic indentation depth for com - pliant polymeric materials and difﬁculties in judgment of cantilever selection criteria , simple slope analysis of force – distance data is very ambiguous and can be rec - ommended only for crude estimation of elastic moduli with possible 30 – 100 % error . Direct calculation of elas - tic moduli implemented here gives reliable results on depth modulation of elastic properties with vertical res - olution better than 10 nm and lateral resolution in the range of 20 – 150 nm for different materials . Close cor - relation is observed between elastic moduli determined by SFM and known values for bulk materials . A large range of elastic polymer properties can be probed if a selection of cantilever stiffness from 0 . 1 to 50 N m ¡ 1 is available . Elastic moduli can be measured as low as several MPas for rubbers to as high as several GPas for 4908 P1 : PNR / SNG P2 : PNR / RNT P3 : PNR / ATR QC : SDI 3072 - 98 November 20 , 1998 2 : 59 glassy polymers . The SFM ability to probe depth pro - ﬁles of elastic properties at the submicron scale is un - parallelled for nanocomposite materials with spatially distributed mechanical response .
