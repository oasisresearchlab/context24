Newman Department of Physics , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI 48109 – 1120 and Santa Fe Institute , 1399 Hyde Park Road , Santa Fe , NM 87501 A network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that have many connec - tions tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections . We deﬁne a measure of assortative mixing for networks and use it to show that social networks are often assortatively mixed , but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative . We propose a model of an assortative network , which we study both analytically and numerically . Within the framework of this model we ﬁnd that assortative networks tend to percolate more easily than their disassortative counterparts and that they are also more robust to vertex removal . Many systems take the form of networks—sets of ver - tices joined together by edges—including social networks , computer networks , and biological networks [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . A variety of models of networks have been proposed and studied in the physics literature , many of which have been successful at reproducing features of networks in the real world [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . One particularly well - studied model is the cumulative advantage or preferential attachment model [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] in which the probability of a given source vertex forming a connection to a target vertex is some ( usually increasing ) function of the degree of the target vertex . ( The degree of a vertex is the number of other vertices to which it is attached . ) Preferential at - tachment processes are widely accepted as the probable explanation for the power - law and other skewed degree distributions seen in many networks [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] . However , there is an important element missing from these as well as other network models : in none of these models does the probability of attachment to the target vertex depend also on the degree of the source vertex . In the real world on the other hand such dependencies are common . Many networks show “assortative mixing” on their degrees , i . e . , a preference for high - degree vertices to attach to other high - degree vertices . Others show dis - assortative mixing—high - degree vertices attach to low - degree ones . In this paper we ﬁrst demonstrate the pres - ence of assortative mixing in a variety of networks by direct measurement , and then argue , using exactly solv - able models and numerical simulations , that assortative mixing can have a substantial eﬀect on the behavior of networked systems . Models that do not take it into ac - count will necessarily fail to reproduce correctly many of the behaviors of real - world networked systems . Consider then a network , represented in the simplest case by an undirected graph of N vertices and M edges , with degree distribution p k . That is , p k is the probability that a randomly chosen vertex on the graph will have degree k . Now consider a vertex reached by following a randomly chosen edge on the graph . The degree of this vertex is not distributed according to p k . Instead it is biased in favor of vertices of high degree , since more edges end at a high - degree vertex than at a low - degree one . This means that the degree distribution for the vertex at the end of a randomly chosen edge is proportional kp k , rather than just p k . In this paper , we will usually be interested not in the total degree of such a vertex , but in the remaining degree —the number of edges leaving the vertex other than the one we arrived along . This number is one less than the total degree and hence is distributed in proportion to ( k + 1 ) p k + 1 . The correctly normalized distribution q k of the remaining degree is then q k = ( k + 1 ) p k + 1 P j jp j . ( 1 ) Following Callaway et al . [ 15 ] , we now deﬁne the quan - tity e jk to be the joint probability distribution of the remaining degrees of the two vertices at either end of a randomly chosen edge [ 34 ] . This quantity is symmetric in its indices on an undirected graph e jk = e kj , and obeys the sum rules X jk e jk = 1 , X j e jk = q k . ( 2 ) In a network with no assortative ( or disassortative ) mixing e jk takes the value q j q k . If there is assortative mixing , e jk will diﬀer from this value and the amount of assortative mixing can be quantiﬁed by the con - nected degree - degree correlation function h jk i−h j ih k i = P jk jk ( e jk − q j q k ) , where h . . . i indicates an average over edges [ 15 ] . This correlation function is zero for no as - sortative mixing and positive or negative for assorta - tive or disassortative mixing respectively . For the pur - poses of comparing diﬀerent networks , it is convenient to normalize it by dividing by its maximal value , which it achieves on a perfectly assortative network , i . e . , one with e jk = q k δ jk . This value is equal to the variance σ 2 q = P k k 2 q k − (cid:2)P k kq k (cid:3) 2 of the distribution q k , and hence the normalized correlation function is r = 1 σ 2 q X jk jk ( e jk − q j q k ) , ( 3 ) which is simply the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of the degrees at either ends of an edge and lies in the range − 1 ≤ r ≤ 1 [ 35 ] . For the practical purpose of evaluating r on an observed network , we can rewrite ( 3 ) as r = M − 1 P i j i k i − (cid:2) M − 1 P i 12 ( j i + k i ) (cid:3) 2 M − 1 P i 12 ( j 2 i + k 2 i ) − (cid:2) M − 1 P i 12 ( j i + k i ) (cid:3) 2 , ( 4 ) 2 network n r r e a l - w o r l d n e t w o r k s physics coauthorship a 52 909 0 . 363 biology coauthorship a 1 520 251 0 . 127 mathematics coauthorship b 253 339 0 . 120 ﬁlm actor collaborations c 449 913 0 . 208 company directors d 7 673 0 . 276 Internet e 10 697 − 0 . 189 World - Wide Web f 269 504 − 0 . 065 protein interactions g 2 115 − 0 . 156 neural network h 307 − 0 . 163 food web i 92 − 0 . 276 m o d e l s random graph u 0 Callaway et al . v δ / ( 1 + 2 δ ) Barab´asi and Albert w 0 TABLE I : Size n and assortativity coeﬃcient r for a num - ber of diﬀerent networks : collaboration networks of ( a ) sci - entists in physics and biology [ 16 ] , ( b ) mathematicians [ 17 ] , ( c ) ﬁlm actors [ 4 ] , and ( d ) businesspeople [ 18 ] ; ( e ) connections between autonomous systems on the Internet [ 19 ] ; ( f ) undi - rected hyperlinks between Web pages in a single domain [ 6 ] ; ( g ) protein - protein interaction network in yeast [ 20 ] ; ( h ) undi - rected ( and unweighted ) synaptic connections in the neu - ral network of the nematode C . Elegans [ 4 ] ; ( i ) undirected trophic relations in the food web of Little Rock Lake , Wis - consin [ 21 ] . The last three lines give analytic results for model networks in the limit of large network size : ( u ) the random graph of Erd˝os and R´enyi [ 22 ] ; ( v ) the grown graph model of Callaway et al . [ 15 ] ; ( w ) the preferential attachment model of Barab´asi and Albert [ 6 ] . where j i , k i are the degrees of the vertices at the ends of the i th edge , with i = 1 . . . M [ 36 ] . In Table I we show values of r for a variety of real - world networks . As the table shows , of the social networks studied ( the top ﬁve entries in the table ) all have signiﬁ - cant assortative mixing , which accords with accepted wis - dom within the sociological community . By contrast , the technological and biological networks studied ( the mid - dle ﬁve entries ) all have disassortative mixing—high de - gree vertices preferentially connect with low degree ones and vice versa . Various explanations for this observation suggest themselves . In the case of the Internet , for ex - ample , it appears that the high degree vertices mostly represent connectivity providers—telephone companies and other communications carriers—who typically have a large number of connections to clients who themselves have only a single connection [ 19 ] . Thus the high - degree vertices do indeed tend to be connected to the low - degree ones . We have also calculated r analytically for three mod - els of networks : ( 1 ) the random graph of Erd˝os and R´enyi [ 22 ] , in which edges are placed at random between a ﬁxed set of vertices ; ( 2 ) the grown graph model of Callaway et al . [ 15 ] , in which both edges and vertices are added at random at constant but possibly diﬀerent rates , the ratio of the rates being denoted δ ; ( 3 ) the grown graph model of Barab´asi and Albert [ 6 ] , in which both edges and vertices are added , and one end of each edge is added with linear preferential attachment . For the random graph , since edges are placed at ran - dom without regard to vertex degree it follows trivially that r = 0 in the limit of large graph size . The model of Callaway et al . however , although apparently similar in construction , gives a markedly diﬀerent result . From Eq . ( 21 ) of Ref . 15 , e jk for this model satisﬁes the recur - rence relation ( 1 + 4 δ ) e jk = 2 δ ( e j − 1 , k + e j , k − 1 ) + p j p k , ( 5 ) and the degree distribution is p k = ( 2 δ ) k / ( 1 + 2 δ ) k + 1 . Substituting into Eq . ( 3 ) and making use of Eq . ( 2 ) , we then ﬁnd that r = δ / ( 1 + 2 δ ) . Thus the model shows signiﬁcant assortative mixing , with a maximum value of r = 12 in the limit of large δ . This agrees with intu - ition [ 15 ] : in the grown graph the older vertices have higher degree and also tend to have higher probability of being connected to one another , simply by virtue of being around for longer . Thus one would expect positive assortative mixing . The model of Barab´asi and Albert [ 6 ] provides an inter - esting counter - example to this intuition . Although this is a grown graph model , in which again older vertices have higher degree [ 23 ] , it shows no assortative mixing at all . Making use of Eq . ( 42 ) of Ref . 24 we can show that e jk for the model of Barab´asi and Albert goes asymp - totically as 1 / ( j 2 k 2 ) − 6 / ( j + k ) 4 in the limit of large j and k , which implies that r → 0 as ( log 2 N ) / N as N becomes large . The model of Barab´asi and Albert has been used as a model of the structure of the Internet and the World - Wide Web . Since these networks show signif - icant disassortative mixing however ( Table I ) , it is clear that the model is incomplete . It is an interesting open question what type of network evolution processes could explain the values of r observed in real - world networks . Turning now to theoretical developments , we propose a simple model of an assortatively mixed network , which is exactly solvable for many of its properties in the limit of large graph size . Consider the ensemble of graphs in which the distribution e jk takes a speciﬁed value . This deﬁnes a random graph model similar in concept to the random graphs with speciﬁed degree sequence [ 5 , 25 , 26 ] , except for the added element of assortative mixing . Consider a typical member of this ensemble in the limit of large graph size , and consider a randomly chosen edge in that graph , one end of which is attached to a vertex of degree j . We ask what the probability distribution is of the number of other vertices reachable by following that edge . Let this probability distribution be generated by a generating function G j ( x ) , which depends in general on the degree j of the starting vertex . By arguments similar to those of Ref . 5 , we can show that G j ( x ) must satisfy a self - consistency condition of the form G j ( x ) = x P k e jk (cid:2) G k ( x ) (cid:3) k P k e jk , ( 6 ) while the number of vertices reachable from a randomly 3 chosen vertex is generated by H ( x ) = xp 0 + x ∞ X k = 1 p k (cid:2) G k − 1 ( x ) (cid:3) k . ( 7 ) The average size of the component to which such a vertex belongs is given by the derivative of H : h s i = H ′ ( 1 ) = 1 + P k kp k G ′ k − 1 ( 1 ) . Diﬀerentiating Eq . ( 6 ) we then get h s i = 1 − z q · A − 1 · q , ( 8 ) where z is the mean degree , q is the vector whose ele - ments are the q k , and A is the asymmetric matrix with elements A jk = ke jk − q k δ jk . Equation ( 8 ) diverges at the point at which the deter - minant of A is zero . This point marks the phase trans - ition at which a giant component forms in our graph . By considering the behavior of Eq . ( 8 ) close to the transition , where h s i must be large and positive in the absence of a giant component , we deduce that a giant component exists in the network when det A > 0 . This is the ap - propriate generalization for a network with assortative mixing of the criterion of Molloy and Reed [ 26 ] for the existence of a giant component . To calculate the size S of the giant component , we deﬁne u k to be the probability that an edge connected to a vertex of remaining degree k leads to another vertex that does not belong to the giant component . Then S = 1 − p 0 − ∞ X k = 1 p k u kk − 1 , u j = P k e jk u kk P k e jk . ( 9 ) As with most other random graph models , including the original model of Erd˝os and R´enyi , it is usually not pos - sible to solve for S in closed form , but we can determine it by numerical iteration from a suitable set of starting values for u k . To test these results and to help form a more complete picture of the properties of assortatively mixed networks , we have also performed computer simulations , generat - ing networks with given values of e jk and measuring their properties directly . Generating such networks is not en - tirely trivial . One cannot simply draw a set of degree pairs ( j i , k i ) for edges i from the distribution e jk , since such a set would almost certainly fail to satisfy the basic topological requirement that the number of edges end - ing at vertices of degree k must be a multiple of k . In - stead therefore we propose the following Monte Carlo algorithm for generating graphs . First , we generate a random graph with the desired degree distribution according to the prescription given in Ref . 26 . Then we apply a Metropolis dynamics to the graph in which on each step we choose at random two edges , denoted by the vertex pairs , ( v 1 , w 1 ) and ( v 2 , w 2 ) , that they connect . We measure the remaining degrees ( j 1 , k 1 ) and ( j 2 , k 2 ) for these vertex pairs , and then re - place the edges with two new ones ( v 1 , v 2 ) and ( w 1 , w 2 ) with probability min ( 1 , ( e j 1 j 2 e k 1 k 2 ) / ( e j 1 k 1 e j 2 k 2 ) ) . This dynamics conserves the degree sequence , is ergodic on the set of graphs having that degree sequence , and , with the choice of acceptance probability above , satisﬁes de - tailed balance for state probabilities Q i e j i k i , and hence has the required edge distribution e jk as its ﬁxed point . As an example , consider the symmetric binomial form e jk = N e − ( j + k ) / κ (cid:20)(cid:18) j + k j (cid:19) p j q k + (cid:18) j + k k (cid:19) p k q j (cid:21) , ( 10 ) where p + q = 1 , κ > 0 , and N = 12 ( 1 − e − 1 / κ ) is a nor - malizing constant . ( The binomial probabilities p and q should not be confused with the quantities p k and q k in - troduced earlier . ) This distribution is chosen for analytic tractability , although its behavior is also quite natural : the distribution of the sum j + k of the degrees at the ends of an edge falls oﬀ as a simple exponential , while that sum is distributed between the two ends binomially , the parameter p controlling the assortative mixing . From Eq . ( 3 ) , the value of r is r = 8 pq − 1 2e 1 / κ − 1 + 2 ( p − q ) 2 , ( 11 ) which can take both positive and negative values , passing through zero when p = p 0 = 12 − 14 √ 2 = 0 . 1464 . . . In Fig . 1 we show the size of the giant component for graphs of this type as a function of the degree scale pa - rameter κ , from both our numerical simulations and the exact solution above . As the ﬁgure shows , the two are in good agreement . The three curves in the ﬁgure are for p = 0 . 05 , where the graph is disassortative , p = p 0 , where it is neutral ( neither assortative nor disassortative ) , and p = 0 . 5 , where it is assortative . As κ becomes large we see the expected phase trans - ition at which a giant component forms . There are two important points to notice about the ﬁgure . First , the position of the phase transition moves lower as the graph becomes more assortative . That is , the graph percolates more easily , creating a giant component , if the high - degree vertices preferentially associate with other high - degree ones . Second , notice that , by contrast , the size of the giant component for large κ is smaller in the assor - tatively mixed network . These ﬁndings are intuitively reasonable . If the net - work mixes assortatively , then the high - degree vertices will tend to stick together in a subnetwork or core group of higher mean degree than the network as a whole . It is reasonable to suppose that percolation would occur ear - lier within such a subnetwork . Conversely , since perco - lation will be restricted to this subnetwork , it is not sur - prising that the giant component has a smaller size in this case than when the network is disassortative . These re - sults could have implications , for example , for the spread of disease on social networks [ 27 ] —social networks being assortatively mixed in many cases , as Table I shows . The core group of an assortatively mixed network could form a “reservoir” for disease , sustaining an epidemic even in cases in which the network is not suﬃciently dense on av - erage for the disease to persist . On the other hand , one 4 1 10 100 exponential parameter κ 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 g i a n t c o m pon e n t S assortative neutral disassortative FIG . 1 : Size of the giant component as a fraction of graph size for graphs with the edge distribution given in Eq .

( squares ) , and 0 . 05 ( triangles ) . would expect the disease to be restricted to a smaller segment of the population in such cases than for diseases spreading on neutral or disassortative networks . Assortative mixing also has implications for questions of network resilience , the subject of much discussion in the recent literature [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ] . It has been found that the connectivity of many networks ( i . e . , the exis - tence of paths between pairs of vertices ) can be destroyed by the removal of just a few of the highest degree vertices , a result that may have applications in , for example , vac - cination strategies [ 33 ] . In assortatively mixed networks , however , we ﬁnd numerically that removing high - degree vertices is a relatively ineﬃcient strategy for destroying network connectivity , presumably because these vertices tend to be clustered together in the core group , so that removing them is somewhat redundant . In a disassor - tative network with a similarly sized giant component attacks on the highest degree vertices are much more eﬀective , these vertices being broadly distributed over the network and presumably therefore forming links on many paths between other vertices . For networks of the type described by Eq . ( 10 ) we ﬁnd that the number of high - degree vertices that need to be removed to destroy similarly sized giant components is greater by a factor of about ﬁve to ten in an assortative network ( p = 0 . 5 ) than in a disassortative one ( p = 0 . 05 ) for the typical parameter values studied here . These considerations paint rather a grim picture : the networks that we might want to break up , such as the social networks that spread disease , appear to be assor - tative , and therefore are resilient , at least against simple targeted attacks such as attacks on the highest degree vertices . And yet at the same time the networks that we would wish to protect , including technological networks such as the Internet , appear to be disassortative , and are hence particularly vulnerable . To conclude , in this paper we have studied assortative mixing by degree in networks—the tendency for high - degree vertices to associate preferentially with other high - degree vertices . We have deﬁned a scalar measure of assortative mixing and used it to show that many so - cial networks have signiﬁcant assortative mixing , while technological and biological networks seem to be disas - sortative . We have also proposed a model of an assor - tatively mixed network , which we have solved exactly using generating function techniques , and also simulated using a Monte Carlo graph sampling method . Within this model we ﬁnd that assortative networks percolate more easily and that they are also more robust to removal of their highest degree vertices , while disassortative net - works percolate less easily and are more vulnerable . This suggests that social networks may be robust to interven - tion and attack while technological networks are not .

That quantity however , which is denoted n kl , is more complex than the one used here , being asymmet - ric in its indices , because one index is designated as being the “ancestral” index with respect to the order in which the graph was grown . [ 35 ] The quantity r can easily be generalized to the case of a directed network , where e jk is asymmetric and r = P jk jk ( e jk − q j q k ) / ( σ in σ out ) , with σ in and σ out being the standard deviations of the remaining degrees at the in - going and out - going ends of the edge respectively . [ 36 ] One can use either the total degrees or the remaining degrees to evaluate Eq . ( 4 ) —the answer is the same ei - ther way . Note also that we have written Eq . ( 4 ) in a form manifestly symmetric in j i and k i , so that it doesn’t mat - ter which end of an edge is which .
