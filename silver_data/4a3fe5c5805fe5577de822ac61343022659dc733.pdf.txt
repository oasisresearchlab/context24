Rosen 6 * Abstract Background Early in the COVID - 19 pandemic , reports about a possible protective effect of nicotine on COVID - 19 conflicted with messaging by public health organizations about increased risks of COVID - 19 due to smoking . The ambiguous information the public received , combined with COVID - 19 - induced anxiety , may have led to changes in tobacco or other nicotine product use . This study examined changes in use of combustible cigarettes ( CCs ) , nargila ( hookah / waterpipe ) , e - cigarettes , and IQOS and home - smoking behaviors . We also assessed COVID - 19 related anxiety and perceptions regarding changes in risk of COVID - 19 severity due to smoking . Methods We used cross - sectional data from a population telephone survey that was conducted in Israel in the early phase of the COVID - 19 pandemic ( May – June 2020 ) and included 420 adult ( age 18 + ) individuals who reported having ever used CCs ( n = 391 ) , nargila ( n = 193 ) , and / or electronic cigarettes ( e - cigarettes ) / heated tobacco products ( e . g . , IQOS ) ( n = 52 ) . Respondents were asked about the effect that COVID - 19 had on their nicotine product use ( quit / reduced use , no change , increased use ) . We assessed changes in product use , risk perceptions , and anxiety using adjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses . Results Most respondents did not change their frequency of product use ( CCs : 81 . 0 % , nargila : 88 . 2 % , e - cigarettes / IQOS : 96 . 8 % ) . A small percentage either decreased use ( CCs : 7 . 2 % , nargila : 3 . 2 % , e - cigarettes / IQOS : 2 . 4 % ) or increased use ( CCs : 11 . 8 % , nargila : 8 . 6 % , e - cigarettes / IQOS : + 0 . 9 % ) . 55 . 6 % of respondents used a product in the home prior to COVID - 19 ; but during the first lockdown COVID - 19 period , a greater percentage increased ( 12 . 6 % ) than decreased ( 4 . 0 % ) their home use . Higher levels of anxiety due to COVID - 19 were associated with increased home smoking ( aOR = 1 . 59 , 95 % CI : 1 . 04 – 2 . 42 , p = 0 . 02 ) . Many respondents believed that increased severity of COVID - 19 illness was associated with CCs ( 62 . 0 % ) and e - cigarettes / vaping ( 45 . 3 % ) , with uncertainty about the association being lower for CCs ( 20 . 5 % ) than for vaping ( 41 . 3 % ) . Conclusions While many respondents believed that nicotine product use ( particularly CCs and e - cigarettes ) was associated with increased risk of COVID - 19 disease severity , the majority of users did not change their tobacco / nico - tine use . The confusion about the relationship between tobacco use and COVID - 19 calls for clear evidence - based * Correspondence : Laura J .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 messaging from governments . The association between home smoking and increased COVID - 19 - related stress sug - gests the need for campaigns and resources to prevent smoking in the home , particularly during times of stress . Keywords COVID - 19 , Tobacco use , Smoking , Nargila , Electronic cigarettes , IQOS , Home smoking , Cultural differences Implications The initial phase of the COVID - 19 pandemic ( March until June 2020 ) in Israel appears to have had no net impact on tobacco use behaviors among individuals who had ever smoked , vaped , or experimented with tobacco or nicotine . It should be noted that no net impact is a less negative outcome than the typical increase of smok - ing observed following other population crises , such as natural disasters and the 9 / 11 attack . However , home - smoking increased during the first lockdown period , increasing the already high prevalence ( 56 % ) of home smoking in Israel . Increased COVID - 19 - related anxiety was associated with increased home smoking . Introduction COVID - 19 is a population - level stressor of unprec - edented global proportions due to its impact on health and the economy . The pandemic led to significant psy - chological trauma ( e . g . , stress , anxiety , depression ) as a result of sudden lifestyle changes and uncertainty about the future . The United States Centers for Disease Con - trol and Prevention ( US CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) identified populations at increased risk of severe illnesses from COVID - 19 : those older than 65 years ; those with underlying medical conditions , such as chronic lung disease , diabetes , cardiac disease , cancer ; and those with compromised immune systems . The CDC also identified those who smoke ( or have a history of smoking ) as being at an increased risk for severe compli - cations from COVID - 19 [ 1 ] . There was little to no infor - mation about the association of vaping on the severity of COVID - 19 . While the data are not conclusive , a number of stud - ies have reported that smoking increases the risk of greater disease severity and mortality from COVID - 19 [ 2 , 3 ] . Other studies found the opposite—that disease severity and hospitalization rates were lower for smok - ers relative to non - smokers [ 4 – 6 ] . Early reports from China [ 7 ] , the US [ 8 ] , Italy [ 9 ] , France [ 10 ] , and Ger - many [ 11 ] showed that smokers were underrepresented among hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 . This find - ing provoked substantial debate about the relationship between smoking and COVID - 19 in the medical and lay press [ 7 , 12 – 15 ] . Some scientists rejected the find - ings on the basis of study flaws and data limitations , and others considered whether a possible protective influence of nicotine might exist [ 13 , 16 ] . Other meta - analyses emerged with contradictory results , reporting that current and former smokers were at increased risk of significant disease severity compared to never smok - ers [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] . A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that health communications have a significant impact on tobacco - related behavior [ 19 – 21 ] . With the onset of COVID - 19 , media coverage of all aspects of the pan - demic in Israel was frequent . The relationship between smoking and COVID - 19 received substantial atten - tion . In addition to the international reports , two large local studies based on existing population - level data on smoking status prior to COVID - 19 received wide coverage . The first , based on data from Israel’s larg - est Health Maintenance Organization ( HMO ) , Clalit Health Services , which serves 3 million adults , found that the risk of transmitting COVID - 19 was reduced by half among current smokers [ 22 ] . The second , based on the complete medical records of 4353 individuals who were members of the HMO , found that smoking did not significantly increase disease severity among veri - fied COVID - 19 patients [ 23 ] . However , a quantitative content analysis of 11 leading media sites , which did not differentiate between increased risk for COVID - 19 and increased severity of COVID - 19 found that 86 . 6 % of the 82 included articles described an increase in COVID - 19 risk among tobacco users , while 3 . 6 % of articles described a decrease in COVID - 19 risk among tobacco users [ 24 ] . Concern was raised among health professionals that media reports of a possible advantage to smokers might cause some individuals to lose motivation to quit or even increase their smoking [ 25 ] . As the scientific debate raged , some governmental and health organiza - tions provided clear messages that smoking was a risk factor for COVID - 19 transmission or for a more severe case of COVID - 19 . For example , the Israel Ministry of Health’s website section entitled “Smoking as a risk fac - tor for coronavirus” included the statement : “Inhala - tion of smoke or vapors into the lungs … . constitutes a risk factor for becoming infected with coronavirus or for complications of the virus , both for smokers and for those in their immediate surroundings [ 26 ] . The WHO was more moderate , stating that : “At the time of pre - paring this Q & A , there are no peer - reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection Page 3 of 12 Rubinson et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 associated with smoking . However , tobacco smokers ( cigarettes , waterpipes , bidis , cigars , heated tobacco products ) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID - 19 ″ [ 27 ] . From the onset of the pandemic , multiple studies examined smokers’ behavioral changes across several countries . Findings have generally shown that smokers have had varying behavioral reactions , ranging from quit - ting to increasing their consumption of cigarettes . Gen - erally , however , most smokers appear to have not made substantial changes to their consumption patterns [ 28 ] . An online social media survey conducted in Israel among current and ex - smokers found that 7 % of respondents quit during the first lockdown period , 44 . 4 % of cur - rent smokers increased their cigarette consumption , and 16 % attempted to quit [ 29 ] . The study however did not assess changes in nargila use , electronic - cigarettes ( e - cigarettes ) , or IQOS . Further , it was conducted only in Hebrew , on social media sites , and it is unclear whether the Arab population participated at all . In Israel , Arabs ( Muslims , Christians , and Bedouins ) comprise about a fifth of the population . Inclusion of major subpopula - tions in research is critical to get reliable population - wide estimates . This is especially true regarding smoking , as different population groups have different underlying smoking behaviors and may respond to crises differ - ently . Persistent differences in the smoking behavior of the Jewish and Arab populations have been observed in Israel for decades ; these include differences in : smoking prevalence ( 2020 Overall : 20 . 1 % , Jewish male : 22 . 6 % , Jew - ish female : 15 . 8 % , Arab male : 38 . 2 % , Arab female : 10 . 2 % [ 30 ] ) ; patterns of tobacco and nicotine product initiation [ 31 ] ; child exposure to tobacco smoke [ 32 ] ; and adoles - cent exposure to tobacco smoke [ 33 ] . We investigated changes in use of combustible cigarettes ( CCs ) , nargila ( hookah / waterpipe ) , e - cigarettes / IQOS ( the only heated tobacco product sold in Israel ) due to COVID - 19 in our analysis . We used a sample drawn randomly from a nationally representative database covering the entire Israeli population . The survey was conducted in Hebrew , Arabic , Russian , and English . We also examined changes in home - smoking behaviors , COVID - 19 related anxiety and perceptions regarding changes in risk of COVID - 19 severity due to smoking . Methods In Israel , the first case of COVID - 19 was diagnosed on February 21 , 2020 . Social distancing regulations began on March 11 , 2020 , and were quickly expanded to include school and other closures . A national emergency was declared on March 19 , 2020 , followed by restrictions on movement and directives to remain within 100 m of one’s home . On May 4 , 2020 a plan to gradually ease restrictions was passed by the government , with most restrictions relaxed by May 20 , 2020 [ 34 , 35 ] . We con - ducted a cross - sectional study between May 14 and June 22 , 2020 , during and following the end of the first COVID - 19 lockdown in Israel . Sampling strategy and weighting Our sampling frame was comprised of a nationally rep - resentative sample of adult ( aged 18 + ) Israeli residents . The sample of 2500 individuals was obtained from a data - base held by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics ( CBS ) , and was representative in terms of distributions of age , sex , population group ( Jews and Others , Arabs ) , and geographic area . Phone numbers were dialed six times before they were deemed unresponsive . Participation was voluntary ( respondent provided verbal informed con - sent ) , and one telephone interview was conducted per household . The interview lasted 10 minutes on average , and was offered in Hebrew , English , Arabic , or Russian . Weighting was performed based on the distribution of population groups ( Jews and Others , Arabs ) , sex ( male / female ) , and age groups ( 18 – 39 , 40 – 59 , 60 + ) . Population distributions for current and former smokers ( including users of CCs , pipes , cigars , and nargila ) were obtained from the 2017 Social Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics ( CBS ) of Israel , using the Table Gen - erator function on the website [ 36 ] . Because the CBS data included persons aged 20 + , and our data included persons 18 + , we adjusted the weights from numbers obtained from the CBS by adding 10 % to the raw num - bers in the youngest age group ( e . g . , 18 – 39 ) . Twelve cell weights were calculated , for each combination of popu - lation group , sex , and age category , by dividing the cell percent from the CBS data by the cell percent from the data in the current survey . Details can be found in Sup - plementary File 1 . Inclusion criteria Study participants were asked : “Have you ever smoked a cigarette , or used nargilla , or tried an e - cigarettes such as JUUL , or any other tobacco or nicotine vaporizing prod - uct , such as IQOS , even just one puff ? Those who were aged 18 or over , and reported having ever used one of these products were eligible for inclusion in this current study . Measures Population Group We defined population group in the manner done by the CBS [ 37 ] : we used a question on religion ( Jewish / Mus - lim / Christian / Druze / Other ) to define population group by creating an indicator for Jews and Others ( “Jewish population” ) or Arabs ( “Arab population” , e . g . , Muslim / Page 4 of 12 Rubinson et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 Christian / Druze ) . Standard presentation of information on smoking in Israel is according to population group by sex [ 38 ] . Socio‑demographic variables Standard questions were used to assess sex , age , religion , marital status , and income [ 39 ] . We also asked respond - ents whether they had children living with them in their home . Smoking and nicotine product use Questions about smoking were based on the Interna - tional Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation ( ITC ) Pro - ject surveys [ 40 ] . We asked : “On average , how often did you smoke cigarettes ? ” Possible responses were : “Daily / Almost Daily / Most days” ; “Less than daily , but at least weekly” ; “Less than weekly , but at least monthly” ; “Less than monthly ; former , not at all” . We used this to cre - ate the variable “current smoker” ( those who currently smoke at least monthly , yes / no ) , and “ever smoker” which included experimenters , anyone who reported smok - ing less than monthly , and former smokers . We asked whether respondents had ever smoked nargila , with possible answers : “Experimented” ; “Former” ; “Current” ; “Never” . We categorized the answers into current ( yes / no ) and ever ( yes / no ) . Regarding e - cigarettes / IQOS use , we asked : “Have you ever vaped , that is , used an e - cig - arette such as JUUL for example , or any other tobacco or nicotine vaporizing product , such as IQOS for exam - ple , even just once ? ” Possible answers were : “Experi - mented” ; “Former” ; “Current” ; “Never” . We categorized the answers into current ( yes / no ) and ever ( yes / no ) . Change in product use due to COVID‑19 Questions were modified from COVID - 19 questions used in the ITC surveys in the United States , Canada , England , and Australia . We asked : “What effect has the coronavi - rus outbreak had on your smoking ? ” Response options were : “Because of it , I quit smoking” ; “Because of it , I’m thinking of quitting smoking” ; “Because of it , I’m smok - ing less” ; “Because of it , I’m smoking more” ; “Because of it , I started smoking again , even though I had quit before” ; “Because of it , I started smoking” ; “It has had no effect at all on my smoking” . Questions regarding change of use in CCs , nargila , and e - cigarettes / IQOS were cat - egorized into three categories : “Less ( decreased ) ” ; “Same ( no change ) ” ; or “More ( increased ) ” . Responses of “Attempted to quit” were set to missing ( CCs : n = 3 ; Nargila : n = 1 ; Vaping : n = 1 ) as we could not determine whether they had changed their cigarette consumption or not . In the event that a quitter returned to using a prod - uct , they were categorized as “More ( increased ) ” . Risk perception questions These questions , also taken from the ITC surveys , explored the relative severity of COVID - 19 for smoking and vaping individuals relative to same - age non - smok - ers / non - vapers . Regarding smoking , we asked : “Thinking about smokers in general , if a smoker got the corona - virus , how severe do you think the illness would be for them , compared to non - smokers of the same age who got it ? ” Answers were given on a severity scale ranging from 1 “A lot more severe” to 5 “A lot less severe” , with an addi - tional “Don’t know” option . A parallel question was asked to those who reported having ever used an e - cigarette . Changes in anxiety levels due to COVID‑19 We asked participants : “How has the coronavirus out - break and subsequent lifestyle changes have caused you to feel ? ” Responses were on a 5 - point scale ranging from 1 “significantly less anxious than before corona” , to 5 “sig - nificantly more anxious than before corona” [ 41 ] . Smoking in the home was based on a question adapted from the ITC Surveys [ 42 ] . We asked all respondents “Before the coronavirus outbreak , how frequently did you smoke ( cigarettes , nargila , or electronic cigarettes , or any other tobacco or nicotine vaporizing product ) inside your home , including on your balcony or porch ? ” Response options were : “Daily , more than once a day” ; “Daily , once a day” ; “Weekly” ; “Monthly” ; “Less than once a month” ; “Never” . We then asked : “How has the coro - navirus affected how often you smoke inside the home ( cigarettes , nargila , e - cigarettes , or any other tobacco or nicotine vaporizing product ) including on your porch ? The possible responses were : “More inside the house” “Less inside the home” or “The same amount inside the home” . In this manuscript , “home smoking” refers to use of cigarettes , nargila , e - cigarettes , or any other tobacco or nicotine vaporizing product in the home . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9 . 4 . With the exception of unweighted distributions of variables at baseline , which are presented in Table 1 and described in the Results Section , we present results based on weighted data . We present the adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) in Table 2 and in the Results Section . First , we examined use of all products descriptively . Then , we examined changes in behavior due to COVID - 19 . Changes were calculated for those who reported ever using a particular product ( CCs , nargila , e - cig - arettes / IQOS ) . Analyses of changes in home tobacco use ( CCs , nargila , e - cigarettes / IQOS ) were conducted on all participants . Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine changes in CC use , nargila use , e - ciga - rette / IQOS use , and home smoking due to COVID - 19 . Page 5 of 12 Rubinson et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 We adjusted for sex , population group , age category , and increases in anxiety due to COVID - 19 in all mod - els . We also included current CC use and CC risk per - ceptions in the CC change model , current nargila use in the nargila change model , current e - cigarette / IQOS use in the e - cigarette / IQOS model , and CC risk percep - tions and any current use in the home smoking model . Results of the model for changes in use of e - cigarettes / IQOS are not presented because of convergence failure ( due to small sample sizes ) . Our analyses examined : ( a ) risk perceptions regarding the perceived severity of COVID - 19 infection for smokers versus non - smokers ; ( b ) risk perceptions regarding the perceived severity of COVID - 19 infection in non - smoking vapers versus non - smoking non - vapers ; and ( c ) increased anxi - ety levels due to COVID - 19 . We present frequencies of all responses including “don’t know” , and the results of the lin - ear model which included five categories of perceived sever - ity , without the “don’t know” option . We used linear models ( Proc GLM ) to examine the influence of sex , population group , age category , and anxiety on risk perceptions regard - ing CCs and e - cigarettes . Current CC use was included in the CC risk perceptions model and current e - cigarette / IQOS use in the model of e - cigarette risk perceptions . We used a linear model to examine the influence of sex , subpopulation , age category , and current CC use on anxiety . Results Participation Of the 2500 potential respondents in the initial sampling frame , 361 were disconnected and 211 were deemed unresponsive after being called six times . Of the 1928 households we were able to reach , 792 were ineligible because they were never users of any product , a further 25 were deemed ineligible due to the respondent being under aged 18 , and six were unable to answer in any of the four languages of the survey . The tracking of 18 calls was lost due to mistaken or incomplete data collection . Of the 1087 that remained , 667 individuals refused to participate . It is not clear whether those individuals were eligible for the study . We completed a total of 420 inter - views . The response rate was 64 . 2 % [ 43 ] . Demographics The full sample was comprised of 420 respondents . Of the 391 respondents for whom we had information on subpop - ulation , 77 . 8 % ( n = 304 ) were from the Jewish sector and 22 . 2 % ( n = 87 ) were from the Arab sector . Among respond - ents , 35 . 4 % ( n = 138 ) were female and 64 . 6 % ( n = 252 ) were male . The sex distribution differed between the populations ( p < 0 . 001 ) , with Arab women slightly overrepresented rela - tive to population figures of ever smokers from the CBS ( Arab men : 87 . 4 % , n = 76 ; Arab women : 12 . 6 % , n = 11 ) . Average age was 48 . 8 years ( Standard deviation : 14 . 8 ) . 72 . 6 % ( n = 284 ) of our participants identified as Jewish , 18 . 4 % ( n = 72 ) as Muslims , 3 . 8 % ( n = 15 ) as Christians , and 5 . 1 % ( n = 20 ) as Other . Most ( 72 . 9 % , n = 288 ) were mar - ried or partnered . Most ( 61 . 4 % , n = 194 ) reported that they were in average or high income categories , while a minor - ity ( 38 . 6 % , n = 122 ) reported that they were in income cat - egories below average . Most ( 60 . 9 % , n = 230 ) reported that children lived with them in their home see Table 1 .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 Behavior : use of CCs , nargila , e‑cigarettes / IQOS , and home smoking In this population of ever - users ( current and former users combined ) of CCs , nargila , e - cigarettes and / or IQOS , the most common currently used product was CCs ( 51 . 0 % ) , followed by nargila ( 11 . 5 % ) , and e - cigarettes and / or IQOS ( 2 . 0 % ) . The most common product ever used was CCs ( 94 . 2 % ) , followed by nar - gila ( 52 . 4 % ) , and e - cigarettes / IQOS ( 14 . 1 % ) . Of those who had ever used CCs , 54 . 2 % were current smokers . Of those who had ever used nargila , 22 . 0 % were cur - rent users , and of those who had ever used e - cigarettes or IQOS , 14 . 0 % were currently using e - cigarettes or IQOS . Of ever - nargila users , 3 . 9 % had never used CCs or e - cigarettes . Of ever - vapers , 2 . 7 % had never used CCs or nargila . See Supplementary File 2 . Among all respondents , 42 . 0 % were not currently using any product , 52 . 1 % were using a single product , 5 . 7 % were using two products , and 0 . 25 % were using three products . Among ever - smokers , 43 . 1 % had only used CCs , 42 . 4 % were dual users of CCs and nargila , 4 . 3 % were dual users of CCs and e - cigarettes or IQOS , and 10 . 2 % had used three products . Among all respondents , prior to COVID - 19 , 44 . 9 % used a product at least daily in their home , while 10 . 7 % used a product in the home weekly , monthly , or less than monthly , and 44 . 4 % had never used a product in their home . Changes in behavior regarding use of CCs , nargila , e‑cigarettes / IQOS , and home smoking Use of all products was unchanged in a majority of respondents ( CCs : 81 . 0 % , nargila : 88 . 2 % , e - cigarettes / IQOS : 96 . 8 % ) . While 7 . 2 % of ever - users of CCs decreased or quit smoking , 11 . 8 % increased the amount of their CC smoking . For nargila , the results were similar ( decreased / quit : 3 . 2 % , increased : 8 . 6 % ) ; 2 . 4 % of repondents reported decreasing or quitting e - cigarette use and 0 . 9 % reported using e - cigarettes more frequently . Figure 1 shows these changes . Table 1 presents demographic variables by change in CC smoking . In Table 2 , we present the results for changes in use of products due to COVID - 19 . There were no statistically significant associations between change in CC use for any of the potential explanatory variables . Non - current nargila users were significantly less likely to increase nargila use ( aOR : 0 . 06 , CI : [ 0 . 02 , 0 . 21 , p < . 001 ) The model on changes in e - cigarette / IQOS use did not meet the convergence criterion , and therefore results are not presented .

Risk perceptions and anxiety levels Most respondents ( 62 . 0 % ) believed that COVID - 19 would be more severe for cigarette smokers than for non - smokers , while only 3 . 3 % believed that COVID - 19 would be lese severe . Nearly half ( 45 . 3 % ) believed that COVID - 19 would be more severe for vapers relative to non - vapers , and just 1 . 6 % of respondents thought that a vaper’s illness would be less severe . About a fifth of respondents ( 20 . 5 % ) didn’t know whether a smoker’s illness would be more severe , and 41 . 3 % of respondents didn’t know whether a vaper’s illness would be more severe ( see Supplementary File 3 ) . Relative to males , females were more likely to believe that COVID - 19 would be more severe for smokers ( p = . 003 ) . There was an inverse relationship between risk perceptions regarding CCs and age group , with younger respondents being more likely to report that COVID - 19 would be more severe for smokers than for non - smokers ( p = 0 . 025 ) . None of the explanatory var - iables reached statistical significance for the endpoint risk perceptions regarding vaping . Women had greater increased anxiety levels due to COVID - 19 relative to men ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( see Table 3 ) . Discussion The early phase of the COVID - 19 pandemic appeared to have had no net effect on changing tobacco / nicotine use behaviors among study respondents who had ever smoked , vaped , or experimented with tobacco or nicotine products in Israel . , A majority of respondents believed that smoking increased severity of COVID - 19 , while close to half believed that COVID - 19 would be more severe for vapers relative to non - vapers Uncertainty regarding the relationship between smoking CCs , vaping , and COVID - 19 was common , likely reflecting the scien - tific ambiguity and the conflicting messages from various scientific reports and from health organizations , in Israel and abroad . Uncertainty about vaping was considerably higher than uncertainty about smoking . Most respond - ents did not change their home smoking behavior due to COVID - 19 ; however , home - smoking was more likely to increase among those who experienced greater anxiety because of COVID - 19 . Fig . 1 Reported changes in use of tobacco and nicotine products among Israelis following the first COVID - 19 lockdown Page 8 of 12 Rubinson et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 We found that there was no substantial net change in smoking among our sample of current and ex - smokers ( 7 . 2 % decreased or quit smoking and 11 . 8 % increased the amount of their smoking ) . This dual trend of both increasing and decreasing smoking has also been observed in numerous other countries . For example , a nationally representative online study of cigarette smok - ers conducted in the Netherlands reported that 18 . 9 % of cigarette smokers increase their smoking , and 14 . 1 % decreased their smoking . A web - based US study found that 30 . 3 % increased and a 28 . 3 % decreased smoking . Another online study in the US found that 24 % of smok - ers increased their consumption and 28 . 0 % decreased smoking [ 44 ] . A study of 6870 adult smokers conducted in Australia , Canada , England , and the US found that 1 . 1 % attempted to quit , 14 . 2 % reduced smoking , and 14 . 6 % increased smoking ( 70 . 2 % reported no change ) [ 28 ] . A national study conducted in Canada found that 3 % increased their smoking and 2 % decreased their smok - ing [ 45 ] . The study conducted in Israel by Bar - Zeev et al . [ 31 ] found that 44 . 3 % of current smokers increased their consumption . This contrasts with our study , which found a much lower proportion of respondents who increased their CC use ( 11 . 8 % ) . However , this may be due to differ - ences in sample composition : we included ever - smokers , while Bar - Zeev et al . assessed changes in smoking among current smokers . Although there are many studies that have examined changes in smoking among adults during COVID - 19 , few have examined changes in vaping behaviors . A UK study conducted online between April 2020 and June 2021 found that 25 % reported a quit attempt ( 16 % due to COVID - 19 - related reasons ) and the quit rate was 18 % . At 12 months , 48 % of continuing vapers reported no change in their vaping frequency , while similar proportions reported vaping less ( 27 . 5 % ) and more ( 24 . 8 % ) [ 46 ] . Another UK study reported that a minor - ity ( 12 . 2 % ) of quit attempts in the past 3 months were reportedly triggered by COVID - 19 , and approximately one in ten current e - cigarette users reported attempt - ing to quit vaping because of COVID - 19 [ 47 ] . In the US , an April – June 2020 study using data collected via Mechanical Turk found that 27 . 3 % of e - cigarette users had increased vaping since the start of the pandemic and 23 . 8 % had decreased ( the remaining vapers did not change their consumption ) [ 44 ] . We found a similar trend whereby the majority did not change their vaping frequency ( 2 . 4 % of respondents reported decreasing or quitting e - cigarette use and 0 . 9 % reported increasing their use ) .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 are low , likely due to the fact that few people use e - ciga - rettes relative to the UK and US . One possible explanation for this dual trend lies in the increased levels of anxiety felt by smokers due to the cor - onavirus outbreak . Anxiety could cause some individu - als to smoke more , and others to smoke less . Before the pandemic , anxiety was found to be a significant factor in increasing the readiness to quit smoking in Arab males in Israel . The connection between this dual trend and anxi - ety is shown in a Dutch study that found a dose - depend - ent relationship between stress and both increased and decreased smoking rates [ 48 ] . One source of anxiety may be due to the higher rates of unemployment seen during COVID - 19 , which caused significant financial stress even in countries such as Israel , which had a strong economic safety net both before and during COVID - 19 . We found that 41 . 7 % of Israelis reported experiencing increased anxi - ety due to the pandemic . This is hardly an isolated phe - nomenon : a study in Germany conducted in late March and early April 2020 found that over 50 % of partici - pants experienced suffering from anxiety and psycho - logical distress due to the pandemic , and a study in India found that 40 % of respondents reported worry , anxiety , and paranoia at the thought of contracting the virus [ 49 ] . Furthermore , a study in Ireland found that generalized anxiety disorder and depression were asso - ciated with loss of income during the pandemic and higher levels of perceived risk from COVID - 19 [ 50 ] . A systematic review found that the general public experi - enced lower psychological wellbeing and higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic [ 51 ] . In our study , although we did not find a statistically sig - nificant relationship between anxiety and changes in CC or nargila smoking , the elevated anxiety rates we observed may still be cause for concern since increased anxiety levels are associated with higher smoking con - sumption , higher rates of COPD and lung neoplasms , and stress has been shown to play a role in perpetuat - ing drug use and relapse [ 52 – 55 ] . It should be noted that the lack of a net effect of COVID - 19 on smoking constitutes a less negative pop - ulation - level impact than major population crises such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks like 9 / 11 [ 56 , 57 ] . This may be a consequence of the public health messag - ing in Israel and internationally that smoking is linked to more severe COVID - 19 illnesses , perhaps amplifying the intuitively appealing notion that a respiratory illness would be more severe among smokers . The explicit link between the source of the crisis and smoking is unique to COVID - 19 , relative to other population - level disas - ters , which may explain why COVID - 19 did not lead to increased smoking . The pandemic caused many people to spend an increased amount of time indoors , whether because of policy aimed at reducing transmission , fear of infec - tion , or suspension of regularly scheduled activities in schools , social organizations , and places of business . We found that , prior to COVID - 19 , 55 . 6 % of respondents used tobacco or nicotine products in their homes , with 12 . 6 % of smoking respondents reporting an increase in their frequency of home product use due to coronavi - rus . Changes in home smoking were significantly associ - ated with anxiety ; those respondents more anxious about COVID - 19 were more likely to increase their smoking in the home . This is a cause for concern as indoor smok - ing is causally linked to lung cancer , stroke , and cardio - vascular disease in adults and low birth weight , sudden infant death syndrome , ear infections , and asthma in children [ 58 ] . Furthermore , nonsmoking occupants , par - ticularly children , are spending more time at home , and thus increasing their exposure to pollutants . Even before the pandemic , based on research in 31 countries , 78 % of women and children living with a smoker , and 59 % of women and young children not living with a smoker , had biomarkers demonstrating tobacco smoke exposure [ 59 ] . Nargila smoking , which produces large amounts of smoke , has been found to cause significantly higher lev - els of carbon monoxide , both in the room where the smoking occurs in and in adjacent rooms [ 60 ] . Previous research showed that Arab infants had a high frequency of exposure to tobacco smoke ( 52 % ) , as well as high lev - els of exposure of Jewish infants ( Jews : 24 . 8 % ) [ 61 ] . Inter - ventions are sorely needed to convince people to refrain from using tobacco products in the home , and especially to protect “captive” non - smoking women and children who are exposed to second - hand tobacco smoke in their own homes . Strengths and Limitations : One of the strengths of this study was that it was based on a representative sample of Israeli households , including majority ( Jewish ) and minority ( Arab ) populations , and was conducted in four languages : Hebrew , Arabic , Russian , and English . More - over , the weighted analyses allowed for generalizations to the population of Israel . In addition , the study meas - ured a variety of inhaled tobacco and nicotine products ( cigarettes , nargila , e - cigarettes , IQOS ) . Because most participants did not change their behavior following the first COVID - 19 lockdown , we had low power to identify correlates of change , leading to our inability to detect small differences in behavior between the majority versus the minority populations . Small numbers of e - cigarette / IQOS users precluded assessment of the association between potential explanatory variables and change in e - cigarette / IQOS use . When asking about smoking in the home , we did not differentiate between types of products Page 10 of 12 Rubinson et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 759 used , in addition , anxiety was measured using a single question and was self - assessed by respondents . The study was conducted during the initial phase of the pandemic and it is not clear whether the findings are applicable to the subsequent waves of COVID - 19 that followed . Summary Our findings demonstrate a need for : ( 1 ) provision of clear evidence - based information on what is known about the relationship between smoking , vaping , and COVID - 19 , and ( 2 ) strong messaging to deter home smoking which may increase as stress increases . This is especially important for household residents who are members of vulnerable populations , particularly young children , pregnant women , and the elderly . Government - sponsored messages could be realistically provided , at nearly no cost to the government , via mandated but as yet unimplemented tobacco package inserts , whose costs would be incurred not by government , but by tobacco and nicotine companies [ 62 ] .
