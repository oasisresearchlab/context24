Toca - 1 Is Required for Cdc42 - Dependent Activation of the Native N - WASP - WIP Complex ( A ) The pyrene - actin assay was used to compare the effect of Toca - 1 ( 10 nM ) on actin polymerization ( 2 (cid:2) M total G - actin ; 35 % pyrene labeled ) in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 30 nM ) , recombinant N - WASP ( 100 nM ) , and Cdc42 - GTP (cid:3) S ( 250 nM ) . All reactions contain actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the other factors are present as indicated . ( B ) A constitutively active N - WASP mutant ( Act . NW ) can induce actin polymerization in Xenopus HSS depleted of both endogenous N - WASP and Toca - 1 . The polymerization kinetics in mock - depleted HSS with or without Cdc42 - GTP (cid:3) S stimulation are shown as controls . ( C ) The fractionation scheme used to purify the native N - WASP - WIP complex from Xenopus egg HSS . During the purification , the complex was followed by (cid:4) - N - WASP immunoblotting . ( D ) Purified preparations of native N - WASP - WIP complex and recombinant untagged N - WASP used in the actin polymerization experiments shown in ( A ) , ( E ) , and ( F ) are shown on a 4 % – 20 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel . Xenopus WIP copurified with N - WASP as a stoichiometric complex and was identified by mass spectrometry . ( E ) The pyrene - actin assay was used to compare the activation of recombinant free N - WASP to that of the purified native N - WASP - WIP complex at several different concentrations by Cdc42 - GTP (cid:3) S ( 250 nM ) alone or Cdc42 - GTP (cid:3) S ( 250 nM ) (cid:6) Toca - 1 ( 10 nM ) . All reactions contained 2 (cid:2) M G actin ( 35 % pyrene labeled ) and 30 nM Arp2 / 3 complex . The fold increase ( above a background reaction lacking any N - WASP ) in the maximum polymerization rate is plotted as a function of N - WASP and N - WASP - WIP concentrations . ( F ) The pyrene - actin assay was used to compare the activation of the purified N - WASP - WIP complex ( 6 nM ) by Cdc42 - GTP (cid:3) S ( 250 nM ) in the presence or absence of Toca - 1 ( 10 nM ) . Cdc42 - GDP ( 250 nM ) is completely inactive in inducing actin polymerization in the presence of both the N - WASP - WIP complex and Toca - 1 . All reactions contained 2 (cid:2) M G actin ( 35 % pyrene labeled ) and 30 nM Arp2 / 3 complex .

The W518K mu - tant was still completely inactive at 20 nM ( Figure 4F ) . complex , thebehavioroftheN - WASP - WIPcomplexwas directly compared to that of recombinant free N - WASP In summary , the ability of Toca - 1 to interact with both Cdc42 and N - WASP is required for its function . Since over a wide range of concentrations ( Figure 5E ) .

Again , this confirms the initial observation that led nant form of N - WASP in cells . This provides a mechanis - us to pursue the purificationof Toca - 1—the Cdc42 path - tic explanation for the requirement of Toca - 1 in mediat - way in extracts is significantly different from the purified ing Cdc42 - induced actin polymerization in extracts . system . There are two possible explanations for this difference in the requirement for Toca - 1 between these systems . First , N - WASP activity in extracts might be Toca - 1 Is Required for PMA - Induced Actin Comet Formation and Vesicle Motility subject to an additional level of inhibition not present in the purified system , and Toca - 1 is involved in relieving in Xenopus Extracts Work in many systems has suggested that N - WASP - this inhibition . Alternatively , the extracts contain an in - hibitor of actin polymerization , such as a filament - cap - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation is directly linked to membrane trafficking ( Schafer , 2002 ; Sokac et al . , ping activity ( Huang et al . , 1999 ) not present in the puri - fied system , and Toca - 1 is required to antagonize such 2003 ) . Actin comet tails , similar to those assembled by Listeria , Shigella , and Vaccinia virus , have been shown an inhibitor . If the requirement of Toca - 1 were at the level of to power the intracellular motility of pinosomes , lyso - somes , and endosomes in a variety of cell types ( Allen , N - WASP activation , this requirement would be bypassed by replacing endogenous N - WASP with a constitutively 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ; Ro - zelleet al . , 2000 ) . The propulsivemovement ofendocytic active form of N - WASP . However , if Toca - 1 antagonizes an inhibitor of actin polymerization , it should still be vesicles by actin comets has also been observed in whole Xenopus eggs and shown to be triggered by a required for actin polymerization induced by the consti - tutively active N - WASP .

We have previously found Since Toca - 1 is an essential component of the Cdc42 pathway , we tested whether Toca - 1 is also required for that native N - WASP exists in a tight complex with CR16 in bovine brain ( Ho et al . , 2001 ) .

PMA - induced actin comet formation in these extracts was abolished by antibody depletion Thus , we speculated that the requirement for Toca - 1 in extracts might reflect its ability to activate the endoge - of Toca - 1 ( Figure 6A ) . The (cid:4) - Toca - 1 antibody ( 30 nM ) was maintained in the reaction to neutralize the Toca - 1 nous N - WASP - WIP / CR16 complex , a requirement that is not present in the purified system since it uses recom - activity carried over from HeLa lysates .

Higher concentrations of Toca - 1 resulted in the formation of longer actin comet tails , tents and are difficult to express as soluble recombinant proteins that are fully functional in our assay system , even presumably due to an increased rate of actin nucleation Cell212 Figure 6 .

A special feature of this Cdc42 - dependent signaling network is the control of actin nucleation by coupling two Cdc42 - dependent regulatory branches ( Figure 7 ) , Discussion mediated by the Cdc42 - N - WASP and Cdc42 - Toca - 1 in - teractions .

However , Toca - 1 and PIP 2 are not redundant in the more physiological milieuofextracts , becauseToca - 1immunodepletionab - rogates PIP 2 - induced actin assembly . This finding sug - gests that the major role of PIP 2 in extracts is upstream of N - WASP , perhaps at the level of Cdc42 activation ( Figure 7 ) . Functional Significance of the N - WASP - WIP Interaction : Insight into the Molecular Pathogenesis of Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Direct comparison of purified native N - WASP - WIP com - plexand recombinantfreeN - WASPin theactinpolymer - ization assay suggests that WIP can suppress not only the activation of N - WASP by Cdc42 alone but also the basalactivationofN - WASPintheabsenceofanyactiva - tors ( Figures 5E and 5F ) , consistent with previous find - ings ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) .

Alternatively , actin nucleation . Our finding that Toca - 1 is required for Toca - 1 could indirectly contribute to N - WASP activation both Cdc42 and N - WASP - dependent actin nucleation by antagonizing the suppressive activity of WIP .

We await a more quantitative exami - The Role of PIP 2 in Cdc42 - Dependent Actin Assembly nation of the pathway to test these possibilities . An important question concerning the regulation of We have previously suggested two roles for PIP 2 in the Cdc42 pathway : one at the level of N - WASP activation the N - WASP - WIP complex is whether binding of Toca - 1 to the complex ( either through N - WASP or WIP or both ) and the second at a more upstream point at the level of Cdc42 activation through a guanine nucleotide exchange leads to the dissociation of the complex . Due to the inability to produce functional free WIP , we have not factor . These conclusions are based on two observations : PIP 2 can bind and activate N - WASP in cooperation with been able to test the possible interaction between WIP and Toca - 1 . Consequently , even though Toca - 1 coated Cdc42 ; however , a mutant of N - WASP that cannot bind or respond to PIP 2 in vitro can largely restore PIP 2 - beads , when mixed with the native N - WASP - WIP com - plex , can pull down both N - WASP and WIP ( data not induced actin assembly to N - WASP - depleted extracts ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) .
