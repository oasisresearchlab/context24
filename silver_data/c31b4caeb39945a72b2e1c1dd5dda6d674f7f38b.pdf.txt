Running Title : Formins modulate Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . Ocpwuetkrv Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 2 Summary The actin cytoskeleton executes a broad range of essential functions within a living cell . The dynamic nature of the actin polymer is modulated to facilitate specific cellular processes at discrete locations by actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) including the formins and tropomyosins ( Tm ) . Formins nucleate actin polymers , while Tms are conserved dimeric proteins that form polymers along the length of actin filaments . Cells possess different Tm isoforms each capable of differentially regulating the dynamic and functional properties of the actin polymer . However the mechanism by which a particular Tm localises to a specific actin polymer is unknown . Here we show that specific formin family members dictate which Tm isoform will associate with a particular actin fialment to modulate their dynamic and functional properties at specific cellular locations . Exchanging the localisation of the fission yeast formins , For3 and Cdc12 , resulted in an exchange in localisations of Tm forms on actin polymers . This nucleator driven switch in filament composition was reflected in a switch in actin dynamics , together with a corresponding change in the hkncogpvÓu " cdknkv { " vq " tgiwncvg " CDRu " cpf " o { osin motor activity . These data establish a role for formins in dictating which specific Tm variant will associate with a growing actin filament and therefore specify the functional capacity of the actin filaments which they create .

Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 4 Results and Discussion The actin cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in facilitating growth during the life cycles of eukaryotes . Regulated by accessory proteins , actin polymerises into dynamic filaments , which can bundle to form cables and act as tracks for myosin motors . Actin is nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins , a conserved group of proteins that catalyse the processive addition of actin monomers to the barbed end of the polymer [ 1 ] . The dynamic and functional properties of different actin polymers are temporally and spatially regulated to facilitate discrete functions through association with ABPs , including Tm . Tms persist in multiple forms within the cell , each associating with actin at distinct locations to modify the nature of the actin polymers [ 2 - 4 ] to facilitate specific cellular functions [ 5 - 9 ] . Schizosaccharomyces pombe possesses a single Tm , Cdc8 [ 10 ] , that persists in both amino - terminally acetylated ( Ace Tm Cdc8 ) and unacetylated ( unace Tm Cdc8 ) forms [ 11 ] . Acetylation stabilises Tm Cdc8 polymers to promote tight actin binding and regulate myosins . In contrast unace Tm Cdc8 filaments form a weaker , more flexible interaction with actin and are unable to regulate actomyosin interactions to the same extent as Ace Tm Cdc8 [ 11 , 12 ] . Each form localises to distinct actin structures within the yeast cell , Ace Tm Cdc8 to Cytokinetic Actomyosin Ring ( CAR ) during mitosis , while unace Tm Cdc8 localises to dynamic cytoplasmic actin polymers that extend from the cell tips during interphase [ 13 ] . Each actin structure has distinct dynamic properties and is nucleated by different formins : Cdc12 ( Formin Cdc12 ) at the CAR during early Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 5 mitosis , and For3 ( Formin For3 ) at the growing ends of the cell during interphase . We asked whether formins regulate actin function by determining the ABP ( including Tm ) composition of different actin structures ? To this end we generated constructs encoding formin - fusion proteins that exchanged the normal distribution of Formin For3 and Formin Cdc12 [ 14 , 15 ] . Tea1 is a polarity factor delivered on microtubules to the cell poles , where it is anchored to the membrane by Tea4 / Wsh3 [ 16 , 17 ] . Fusion of Tea1 to the amino terminus of either Formin Cdc12 or Formin For3 ( generating Tea1 - Formin Cdc12 & Tea1 - Formin For3 ) targeted both formins to the cell poles of wild type , for3 , tea1 , and tea4 deletion cells ( Fig . 1A , S1 ) . The ability of each fusion to nucleate actin was assessed using a GFP actin label ( Fig . 1B ) and immunostaining all fission yeast Tm Cdc8 using an anti - Tm Cdc8 antibody ( Fig . S1 ) [ 11 ] . This illustrated the presence of interphase actin cables in hqt5Ä " efe34 - 112 cells expressing either Tea1 - Formin For3 , Tea1 - Formin Cdc12 or the for3 + gene . In stark contrast antibodies that only detect Tm in its acetylated state [ 13 ] gave no signal in the hqt5Ä Tea1 - Formin For3 cells and staining of interphase actin filaments in the Tea1 - Formin Cdc12 cells ( Fig . 1C , S1 ) . In addition strongly stained arrays of actin - Tm Cdc8 cables were often observed in interphase cells expressing Tea1 - Cdc12 , signifying the composition of the actin bundles is different from normal Formin For3 nucleated interphase actin polymers ( Fig . 1B , S1 ) . Thus , acetylated Tm only associates with Cdc12 nucleated filaments , indicating that the formin Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 6 at the tip of the actin filament either directly or indirectly specifies which Tm is recruited onto the actin polymer The impact each formin - Tm combination had upon the dynamic nature of actin polymers was assessed using either LifeAct or a calponin homology domain GFP fusion ( CHD Rng2 ) [ 18 , 19 ] ( Fig . 2A , S2 , Table 1 , Supplemental Movie 1 ) . Growth rates of fo t5Ä cells expressing Formin For3 and GFP - CHD Rng2 did not differ from wild type when expression from the nmt41 promoter was partially suppressed by adding 4 pmole thiamine . Results were consistent between fluorescent actin markers . Actin filaments nucleated by Formin Cdc12 from the cell poles grew 34 % faster than those nucleated from Formin For3 or in wild type cells ( Table 1 ) . This is consistent with in vitro studies which indicate formins differentially modulate the rate of actin polymerisation [ 20 ] . While filament shrinkage rates were equivalent , mean CHD Rng2 fluorescence was 32 % higher on polymers nucleated from For3 ( Table 1 ) . This observation is consistent with Ace Tm Cdc8 filaments sitting in a more stable position on the actin polymer and raising the possibility that the formin and Tm affect the recruitment of the CHD Rng2 to actin polymers . These findings indicate that formins specify which Tm associates with actin to provide a mechanism for modulating the conformation and dynamics of the polymer at discrete cellular locations . The ability of each formin nucleated actin - Tm Cdc8 polymer to impact the distribution and activity of ABPs was further tested in the following three ways . First , by determining whether the different form - actin - Tm Cdc8 polymers affected the localisation of cofilin ( Adf1 / Cof1 ) and the fission yeast IQGAP Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 7 ( Rng2 ) . We tested whether the formin and Tm affect cofilin distribution as specific Tm isoforms can recruit cofilin to the actin polymer in mammalian cells [ 3 ] . However simultaneous observation of GFP - Adf1 localisation in wild type cells and hqt5Ä " egnnu " gzrtguukpi " Tea1 - Cdc12 revealed modulating the Tm Cdc8 composition of pombe actin cables did not affect the distribution of cofilin ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , while IQGAP Rng2 normally localises to the CAR during mitosis , expressing Tea1 - Cdc12 caused the protein to localise to foci at the end of hqt5Ä cells ( Fig 2C - D ) , illustrating formins plays a role in dictating the cellular localisation of the IQGAP . Second , we examined the impact of each actin - Tm Cdc8 complex on the localisation and movement of the yeast myosin V , Myo52 . While Myo52 - mCherry signal was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in control hqt5Ä cells , Myo52 foci moved along actin filaments to concentrate at sites of cell growth in hqt5Ä cells expressing either Tea1 - For3 or Tea1 - Cdc12 formin fusions ( Fig . 2E ) , demonstrating that interphase actin polymers nucleated from each formin fusion can propagate myosin movement . Myo52 moved along Tea1 - Cdc12 nucleated interphase actin filaments at 75 % the velocity of filaments nucleated by Tea1 - For3 ( Table 1 ) or in wild type cells [ 21 ] ( different at a level of confidence of 99 % ) . While the formin has an impact upon the cellular movement of myosin V within the cell , this may be a consequence of the change in actin polymerization rate it is possible . However the reduction in actin based MyoV motility was reflected in the slower growth rate of Tea1 - Cdc12 cells ( Table 1 ) . Third , the ability of each formin to nucleate actin polymers at the CAR was assessed . The carboxyl - terminal half of the myosin II coiled - coil tail alone Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 8 localises to the cell equator and CAR in early mitosis [ 22 ] . Fusions between the C - terminal half of the Myosin II tail ( Myo2T ) and either Formin For3 or Formin Cdc12 were generated ( Myo2T - For3 Myo2T - Cdc12 , Fig . S3 ) and their ability to localise to the CAR and complement Formin Cdc12 function was monitored in cdc12 - 112 cells at 36…C . In contrast to cdc 34Ä cells which lack any medial actin filaments , mitotic cdc12 - 112 cells contain randomly organised medial wisps of actin [ 15 ] and Myo2 ( Fig . S3 ) at the restrictive temperature . Similarly Myo2 incorporated into disorganised medial filaments in cells expressing Tea1 - For3 , Tea1 - Cdc12 or Myo2T ( Fig . 3A ) . Intriguingly Myo2 associates with filament like structures emanating from the tip of interphase cdc12 - 112 tea1 - cdc12 cells , indicating the Cdc12 formin can affect the distribution of myosin II within interphase cells . In contrast , Myo2T - Cdc12 and Myo2T - For3 incorporated into a CAR , which contracted with kinetics similar to wild type ( Fig . 3B ) . However , the CAR collapsed in the majority of cdc12 - 112 cells expressing Myo2T - For3 upon constriction ( Fig 3Av ) and cells stopped dividing within 2 divisions ( Fig . S3 ) . Immunofluorescence revealed unace Tm Cdc8 , that associates exclusively with interphase actin polymers and not to the CAR in wild type cells [ 13 ] , localised to the CAR in the presence of Myo2T - For3 ( Fig . 3C , Movie 2 ) , supporting the hypothesis that the formin determines which Tm form associates with the growing actin polymer . These data are consistent with cells lacking acetylated Tm Cdc8 frequently forming unstable CARs [ 13 ] , as only acetylated Tm Cdc8 can form the stable polymers that are capable of stabilising actin and regulating myosin II appropriately [ 13 , 23 ] . Intriguingly , as for Formin Cdc12 , For3 dependent actin nucleation is not restricted by location , which suggest that Formins direct Tm recruitment & actin dynamics . 9 formins are either constitutively active , their accumulation at a discrete cellular location is sufficient to promote actin polymerisation activity , or that autoinhibition of Cdc12 activity is abolished by amino terminal fusions . These data demonstrate : ( 1 ) formins define the functional properties of the actin filaments they nucleate in vivo ; ( 2 ) formins regulate the Tm isoform that is recruited to the actin polymer and modulate the affinities of other ABPs for the actin polymer ; and ( 3 ) formins can nucleate functional actin polymers independent of normal cell cycle dependent spatial and temporal constraints . Cells can express multiple forms of Tm ( > 40 isoforms in humans ) , each localising to a discrete cellular location where they differentially modulate the physical properties of actin polymers to facilitate specific functions [ 9 ] . Acetylation provides a level of control additional to variation in sequence to modify the physical properties of Tms and provide a signal to facilitate their recruitment to different actin structures . Formins may modulate the recruitment of associating proteins directly or by modifying conformations in the actin polymer . Formins are not only located at the barbed end of actin filaments where they can associate with the amino termini of the Tm filament incorporating onto the growing actin polymer [ 24 ] , but also associate with lateral surfaces of the actin filament [ 25 , 26 ] . Tm can enhance or block ABP binding to actin [ 8 ] , but Formin may also modulate the pitch of the actin filament directly to change affinities for multiple ABPs [ 24 , 26 , 27 ] . A picture is emerging where formins orchestrate a delicate Tm dependent interplay between ABPs to modulate the functional properties of the actin polymer , allowing actin to facilitate diverse dynamic processes within the cell .

Cells were cultured using Edinburgh minimal media ( EMM2 ) supplemented with amino acids and grown at 25…C unless stated otherwise . Media was supplemented with 5 (cid:181) g / ml thiamine to suppress expression from the nmt41 promoter . Growth rates were determined by generating growth curves using a BMG Spectrostar Nano . Genetic crosses were undertaken on MSA plates [ S14 ] . Strains are listed in Supplemental Table 1 . Molecular Biology : for3 + ( SPCC895 . 05 ) , tea1 + ( SPCC1223 . 06 ) and cdc12 + ( SPAC1F5 . 04c ) genes were amplified from genomic S . pombe DNA using appropriate primers ( Supplemental Table 2 ) and cloned into pGEM - T - Easy ( Promega ) . DNA encoding for the carboxyl terminal of the Myo2 coiled - coil tail [ S12 ] was amplified as an Nde1 — BamH1 fragment from pREP41GFPMyo2T and cloned into pGEM - T - Easy . The subsequent sequenced genes were cloned into the fission yeast carboxyl - terminal tagging vectors pREP41cGFP [ S11 ] and pINT41cmCherry ( lab stock ) to generate the appropriate Tea1 , formin and chimera constructs ( Supplemental Table 3 ) . The latter were designed to include a ( Gly - Ala ) 5 linker between the targeting polypeptide ( i . e . Tea1 or Myo2T ) and formin , identical to the Tea1 - For3 protein described previously [ S15 ] . pINT plasmids were integrated into the leu1 locus of S . pombe chromosome 1 . Microscopy : Samples were visualized using an Olympus IX71 microscope with PlanApo 100x OTIRFM - SP 1 . 45 NA lens mounted on a PIFOC z - axis focus drive ( Physik Instrumente , Karlsruhe , Germany ) , and illuminated using LED light sources ( Cairn Research Ltd , Faversham , UK ) with appropriate filters ( Chroma , Bellows Falls , VT ) . An Optosplit device ( Cairn Research Ltd ) was used to allow simultaneous acquisition of signals from two fluorophores that emitted light of different wavelengths . Samples were visualized using either a QuantEM ( Photometrics ) or ProEM 1024B ( Princeton Instruments ) EMCCD camera , and the system was controlled with Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Each 3D - maximum projection of volume data was calculated from 31 z - plane images , each 0 . 2 ! m apart , using Metamorph or Autoquant X software . During live - cell imaging , cells were mounted onto coverslips with lectin ( Sigma L2380 ; 1 mg / ml ) in a Bioptechs FCS2 ( Bioptechs , Butler , PA ) , fitted onto an ASI motorized stage ( ASI , Eugene , OR ) on the above system , with the sample holder , objective lens and environmental chamber held at the required temperature . All live - cell imaging was undertaken using EMM2 media supplemented with appropriate amino acids . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously [ S16 ] except that glutaraldehyde was omitted . Anti - Cdc8 sera [ S17 ] were used at a dilution of 1 : 100 while anti - Cdc8 ACE and anti - Cdc8 UNACE acetylation state specific antibodies [ S4 ] were used at a dilution of 1 : 50 and 1 : 2 respectively . More than 300 cells / sample were counted to determine localisation statistics , while over 1000 cells / sample were measured for calculating mean cell lengths . Mean myosin V velocities were calculated by fitting velocities of more than 300 foci movements to a Gaussian distribution . Image preparation : Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software . Adjustments in contrast and brightness were equivalent for all cell types within the same experiment ( as per journal guidelines ) . Images within Figures 1 , 2 and S1 were inverted to highlight actin filaments . Figures were prepared using Adobe Illustrator . Analysis of filament dynamics : Growth and shrinkage of actin filaments was measured using Metamorph software . Timelapse movies of 13 x 0 . 2 ! m z - slice time frames ( 0 . 667 sec / time point ; 200 time points , ) were acquired and analysed in a frame - by - frame manner , looking for actin filament growth from the cell poles . Care was taken to ensure that only growth events of a filament nucleating from a single point at the cell poles were measured . This was to ensure that measurements in filament length were not affected by flux , movement or bending . The difference in filament length and time taken were recorded , and rate of filament growth / shrinkage was then calculated . At least 30 growth and shrinkage events were measured for each strain . Examples of frames from a timelapse of two filament shrinkage events are shown in Figure S3A . References S1 . Feierbach , B . , and Chang , F . ( 2001 ) .
