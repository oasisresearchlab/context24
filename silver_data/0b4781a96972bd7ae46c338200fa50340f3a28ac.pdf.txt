In this study , we utilize publicly - available Micro - C data from mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate the relationship between gene transcription and 3D gene folding . Our analysis uncovers a nonmonotonic - globally positive - correlation between intragenic contact density and Pol II occupancy , independent of cohesin - based loop extrusion . Through the development of a biophysical model integrating the role of transcription dynamics within a polymer model of chromosome organization , we demonstrate that Pol II - mediated attractive interactions with limited valency between transcribed regions yield quantitative predictions consistent with Hi - C and live - imaging experiments . Our work provides compelling evidence that transcriptional activity shapes the 4D genome through Pol II - mediated micro - compartmentalization . Introduction Chromosome conformation assays like Hi - C unveiled hierarchical organization of chromosomes within eukaryotic nuclei [ 1 , 2 ] . In metazoans , Mbp - scale " checkerboard " patterns in contact maps reveal spatial segregation of chromosomes into a euchromatic " A " compartment and a heterochromatic " B " compartments [ 3 , 4 ] . At a smaller scale ( ~ 100s kbp ) , chromosomes fold into topologically associating domains ( TADs ) and loops [ 5 - 7 ] . The prevailing model [ 8 ] suggests that compartments emerge from the micro - phase separation of epigenomic regions mediated by chromatin - binding architectural proteins [ 9 , 10 ] , while most TADs result from cohesin - driven chromatin loop extrusion with CTCF acting as a barrier [ 11 , 12 ] . Hi - C and live imaging experiments indicate that depleting CTCF or cohesin disrupts TADs , weakens CTCF - mediated loops , but has limited effects on compartmentalization [ 7 , 13 – 16 ] . Nevertheless , some loops or TADs remain unaffected by these treatments [ 13 , 17 ] , likely originating from distinct mechanisms . 1 3D chromosome organization regulates gene expression during interphase [ 18 – 20 ] . Notably , colocalization of promoters and enhancers within TADs can directly influence transcription initiation , potentially increasing transcription rates [ 20 , 21 ] . Conversely , recent studies suggest that genes serve as central units of the 3D genome and that transcription itself plays a role [ 22 – 25 ] . High - resolution contact maps in mammalian and fly cells reveal transcription - dependent fine structures , such as loops between active gene promoters , promoters and enhancers , or transcriptional start ( TSS ) and termination ( TTS ) sites of the same gene [ 14 , 26 – 29 ] . However , the mechanistic origins of these fine structures , despite their potential significance in gene regulation , remain controversial . Indeed , on the one hand , some experiments in Drosophila and mice indicate higher 3D contacts within expressed gene bodies compared to repressed ones [ 29 , 30 ] . Remodeling of chromatin structure around genes during mouse thymocyte maturation often coincides with transcriptional changes [ 31 ] . RNA Polymerase IIs ( Pol II ) form also distinct foci and higher - order clusters known as transcription factories [ 32 – 35 ] , and active genes tend to colocalize within transcriptionally - active subcompartments [ 27 , 36 ] . On the other hand , there are cases in mammalian cells where significant unfolding of genes occurs after strong transcriptional activation [ 37 – 39 ] , and acute depletion of Pol I , II , and III has minimal effects on large - scale genome folding [ 40 ] . In budding yeast , gene activity inversely correlates with local chromatin compaction [ 25 ] . Live - cell imaging experiments highlight the relationship between gene transcription and chromatin dynamics [ 41 – 45 ] , revealing enhanced gene mobility upon Pol II elongation inhibition [ 41 , 43 , 44 ] or gene activation [ 42 ] and correlated motions between active regions [ 44 , 45 ] . Complementing experiments , biophysical and polymer models have also explored the complex interplay between transcription and genome dynamics [ 35 , 37 , 46 – 49 ] . Elongating or backtracked Pol IIs may act as barriers for SMC - mediated extrusion , indirectly impacting genome organization [ 38 , 46 , 50 – 54 ] . Transcription - dependent changes in the local chromatin fiber rigidity and contour length may lead to extended conformations for highly - transcribed genes [ 37 ] . Computational models considering Pol II - mediated interactions [ 35 ] , interactions with transcription factories or condensates [ 48 , 49 ] , or P - TEFb interactions [ 43 ] suggest that attractive interactions between active regions may capture inter - gene contacts observed in Hi - C and the gene mobility observed in live - imaging . Overall , the evidence presents a complex understanding of the genome spatio - temporal dynamics in response to gene transcription , necessitating a comprehensive framework to reconcile these observations . In this study , we analyze publicly - available Micro - C data for mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) and develop observables to characterize transcription - dependent 3D gene folding . Our analysis reveals a nonmonotonic relationship between intragenic contact density and gene transcription , potentially reconciling contradictory data . By dissecting the contributions of loop extrusion and transcription - associated factors , we propose Pol II occupancy as a key determinant of gene folding . Using a traffic model for gene activity and a 3D polymer model [ 55 , 56 ] , we demonstrate that transcriptionally - active subcompartments and intragenic contact enrichment may arise from Pol II - mediated phase 2 separation . Furthermore , we suggest that Pol II - mediated condensation , coupled with transcriptional bursting , may slow down gene mobility , aligning with experimental observations . Results RNA Pol II occupancy and gene length correlate with intra - gene compaction Fig . 1 . Correlation between intra - gene interaction and intra - gene Pol II enrichments .

( C ) Boxplots of IC after clustering together the genes ( dots in ( B ) ) with similar IR . In this study , we aimed to investigate the potential role of transcriptional activity in the local organization of genes within the genome . To accomplish this , we focused on mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESC ) as they provide abundant quantitative data . Specifically , we utilized publicly available high - resolution Micro - C and Pol II ChIPseq data [ 14 ] . For our analysis , Micro - C contact maps were distance - normalized to examine contact enrichment compared to a sequence - averaged null behavior , resulting in the observed over expected ( obs / exp ) contact map . We introduced two scores for each gene ( Fig . 1A , Materials and Methods ) : ( i ) Intra - gene 3 contact enrichment ( IC ) , which represents the mean obs / exp values calculated for all pairs of loci within the gene , capturing the level of self - association and overall gene compaction . ( ii ) Intra - gene RNA Pol II enrichment ( IR ) , which corresponds to the mean normalized Pol II ChIPseq profile within the gene and reflects gene transcriptional activity , correlating with RNAseq data ( Fig . S1 ) . 4 Fig . 2 . Gene classification based on size and Pol II occupancy , and pileup meta - gene analysis .

The number of genes of each cluster is indicated above on each map . Maps for clusters with less than 25 representative genes were not drawn , due to lack of statistics . ( B ) Average IC scores for each cluster in ( A ) . ( C ) PMGA of different chromatin tracks : in each subplot , all the average profiles of the different Pol II clusters for genes of the same length range are shown ( from left to right : from small to large genes ) ; different colors correspond to the different Pol II clusters , from low ( blue ) to high ( red ) IR score . Figure 1B shows a significant positive correlation ( Spearman ' s ρ = 0 . 56 ) between IC and IR scores , indicating that increased transcriptional activity is associated with enhanced intra - gene compaction , consistent with prior research [ 29 – 31 ] . Additionally , a similar correlation between IC and intra - gene H3K36me3 ( a histone mark related to Pol II elongation ) content was observed ( Fig . S1 ) . Clustering genes based on similar IR scores revealed a nonlinear and non - monotonic relationship ( Fig . 1C ) : IC generally increases with IR , except at very high Pol II levels where a slight but significant relative decrease in contact frequency occurs . Importantly , this behavior cannot be solely attributed to the inherent properties of Micro - C experiments to detect more or less contacts depending on the molecular crowding on DNA [ 25 ] since similar behavior was observed using mESC Hi - C data [ 19 ] ( Fig . S2 ) . Interestingly , this correlation between IR and IC holds true regardless of gene compartment ( A or B ) ( Fig . S3 ) or the number of exons [ 19 ] ( Fig . S4 ) . However , genes with higher exon counts tend to exhibit greater compaction compared to those with fewer exons . Moreover , IC scores for A - compartment genes are generally higher than those for B - compartment genes , with this difference becoming more pronounced for genes with high IR scores , where the drop in IC is more significant for B - genes . In mammals , highly active genes are typically smaller , and larger genes , when active , are usually lowly expressed ( Fig . S5 ) . Hence , we investigated whether gene size could also be a determining factor and classified genes based on both their IR and genomic length ( Materials and Methods ) . Figure 2B displays the average IC score for each category , revealing a positive correlation between IC and gene length : longer genes exhibit stronger intra - gene contact frequency at a given Pol II occupancy density . To gain deeper insights into the contact patterns and profiles within and surrounding genes , we conducted a pile - up meta - gene analysis ( PMGA ) , aggregating the rescaled obs / exp maps and ChIP - seq profiles of genes with similar size and transcriptional activity ( Fig . 2A , C , Materials and Methods ) . PMGA uncovered a strong correlation between Pol II profiles and certain structural features of contact maps : intra - gene contact maps were nearly uniform , consistent with the constant Pol II levels observed within genes ; stripes of preferential interactions were observed between Pol II - rich promoters / TSSs and gene bodies ( " stripe " ) ; and loops were formed between Pol II - rich TSSs and TTSs ( " TSS - TTS loops " ) . Notably , the correlation between H3K36me3 profiles ( which exhibit a depletion around TSSs ) and Hi - C patterns such as TSS - TTS loops and stripes was less apparent ( Fig . 2A , C ) . Regarding the dependency on gene size , we found that promoters of short genes are often located at the domain borders , while larger genes tend to form their own insulated domains separate from surrounding regions . To further investigate the role of Pol II occupancy , we analyzed two publicly available datasets involving the treatment of mESC cells with transcriptional inhibitor drugs : triptolide ( TRP ) , which 5 inhibits Pol II initiation , and flavopiridol ( FLV ) , which inhibits Pol II elongation [ 29 ] . Firstly , we confirmed the significant reduction in the intensity of Pol II - mediated loops after both treatments ( Fig . S6 ) . Consistent with the observed loss of intra - gene Pol II occupancy in all genes , particularly highly transcribed ones ( Fig . S7 , S8 ) , intra - gene interactions were weaker in the TRP and FLV cases compared to the normal condition ( Fig . 3A , S9 , S10 ) , resulting in a 12 % reduction in IC for large active genes post - treatment . There exists a notable correlation between the fold - changes ( treated vs untreated ) in IC and IR scores ( Fig . 3C ) : the greater the reduction in Pol II occupancy for a given gene , the more likely its intra - gene compaction is affected . Interestingly , when re - clustering genes based on their new IR scores measured in TRP - and FLV - treated cells , we still observed an average increase in IC as a function of IR similar to the untreated case ( Fig . 3D ) , suggesting that the remaining intra - gene interactions observed after transcription inhibition may be attributed to residual Pol II occupancies . In summary , our findings demonstrate a correlation between intra - gene compaction , interaction patterns , local transcriptional activity , gene length , and Pol II occupancy . Cohesin - mediated loop - extrusion activity plays a minor role on intra - gene compaction Recent studies , both experimental and theoretical , have proposed that the loop extrusion mechanism , which plays a crucial role in the formation of TADs , might have an impact on the transcription machinery [ 23 , 38 , 46 , 47 , 54 ] . Interestingly , we observed a significant correlation between the occupancy of CTCF and cohesin , the main players in loop extrusion , and the intra - gene contact enrichment and Pol II occupancy ( Fig . 2C , S1 ) . This observation led us to investigate whether cohesin - mediated loop extrusion could drive the correlation between transcriptional activity and intra - gene compaction discussed earlier . To address this question , we analyzed our original dataset from wild - type mESCs and excluded genes with high SMC1a ( a cohesin subunit ) occupancy ( Materials and methods ) . The remaining genes , clustered based on IC and gene length , showed significantly lower levels of CTCF and cohesin , while Pol II profiles remained largely unchanged ( Fig . S11C ) . Despite this subset of genes , the IC and IR scores still exhibited a strong correlation at a level similar to wild - type ( Fig . 3D , S11A , B ) . Additionally , PMGA revealed that the typical interaction patterns observed within genes were still visible for cohesin - poor genes , although certain features such as stripes , which are known to be footprints of loop extrusion activity near extruding barriers [ 38 , 46 ] , were absent outside the genes ( black arrows in Fig . 3B left ) . Furthermore , we utilized three publicly available mESC datasets where CTCF ( ∆CTCF ) , the cohesin subunit RAD21 ( ∆RAD21 ) , or the cohesin unloader WAPL ( ∆WAPL ) were acutely depleted [ 57 ] . These treatments led to significant alterations in CTCF and cohesin occupancies throughout the genome [ 57 ] , as well as changes in TAD folding and CTCF - CTCF loops [ 7 , 13 ] , such as a strong reduction in loop intensity in ∆CTCF and ∆RAD21 and reinforcement in ∆WAPL ( Fig . S6 bottom ) . However , most gene expressions remained unaltered [ 57 ] , and the majority of loops between Pol II peaks were unaffected ( Fig . S6 top ) . Surprisingly , despite the 6 acute changes in intra - gene CTCF and cohesin profiles ( Fig . S12C , S13C , S14C ) , we observed only minimal effects on intra - gene interactions ( Fig . 3B , D , Fig . S10 , S12 - 14A , B ) . The most noticeable - yet weak - changes in IC scores occurred in highly active genes ( high IR ) , with an average 5 % reduction in ∆RAD21 ( Fig . 3B ) . However , the changes in IC between WT and ∆RAD21 conditions did not exhibit a clear correlation with changes in RAD21 occupancy ( Fig . S15 ) . Similar to cohesin - poor genes in WT , the structural features associated with loop extrusion outside genes were lost or significantly reduced in ∆CTCF and ∆RAD21 ( and enhanced in ∆WAPL ) ( Fig . 3E ) . Collectively , these results indicate that cohesin - mediated loop extrusion does not significantly affect the specific organization of transcribed genes , suggesting the presence of an independent mechanism .

( E ) Scheme summarizing the different determinants of structures observed inside or around active genes . A biophysical model to investigate the role of transcription on gene folding Our data analysis strongly suggests that Pol II occupancy drives the 3D organization of genes , independently of cohesin activity . Moreover , recent in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that Pol IIs could form liquid - like droplets either directly through a phase - separation process mediated by weak interactions between their carboxy - terminal domains [ 58 – 60 ] [ 36 , 61 ] or indirectly via the formation of Mediator condensates triggered by nascent RNAs [ 62 ] . In the following , we developed a biophysical model to better characterize the phenomenology of Pol 7 II - mediated gene folding by investigating how effective self - attractions between Pol II - occupied loci may shape the spatio - temporal dynamics of genes .

( Bottom ) Model predictions around the TSS - TTS loop for the non - uniform cases described in ( G ) . TTS - TTS loops and promoter stripes are shown with black and red arrows , respectively . First , we built a stochastic model to describe Pol II occupancy and dynamics at a gene using a standard Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process ( TASEP ) [ 63 – 65 ] . In this model ( Fig . 4A , Materials and methods ) , Pol IIs can be loaded onto chromatin at the TSS with rate 𝛼 , transcription elongation initiates with rate , Pol IIs then progress along the gene at rate 𝛾 until 𝛾 0 they unbind from chromatin at TTS with a rate 𝛽 . During this process , Pol IIs cannot overlap or bypass each other . With this simple model , we can predict the average Pol II density profile along the gene at steady - state ( Fig . S16 ) . For example , by varying model parameters ( γ 0 / γ = 1 , ) , we reproduced uniform average profiles of Pol II occupancy along the gene , β / γ = 1 − α / γ ranging from low ( ~ 0 . 02 ) to high ( ~ 0 . 80 ) densities ( Fig . 4B , C ) . Next , to assess the spatial organization of a gene , we integrated the TASEP in a 3D polymer model of chromatin fiber [ 55 , 56 ] ( Fig . 4A , Materials and methods ) . Briefly , we represented a 20 Mbp - long section of chromatin as a self - avoiding chain ( 1 monomer = 2kbp = 50nm ) . We focused on a region of size L in the middle of the chain , which represents the gene of interest . Each monomer within the gene is characterized by a random binary variable indicating the local Pol II occupancy , whose dynamics is described by the TASEP . To investigate the impact of Pol IIs density and dynamics on gene folding , we assumed that monomers occupied by Pol II at a given time may self - interact at short - range with energy strength E . All the other monomers are considered non - interacting , neutral particles . The coupled stochastic spatio - temporal dynamics of the Pol II occupancies and 3D positions of the monomers are then simulated using kinetic Monte - Carlo ( Materials and methods ) . Self - attraction between Pol II - bound genomic regions drives the intra - gene spatial organization The coil - to - globule transition of a gene is controlled by Pol II occupancy and gene length We quantified generic structural properties of the model and investigated the relationship between gene compaction ( IC scores ) and Pol II density ( IR scores ) with respect to model parameters . In particular , we varied IR scores ( via ) while keeping other TASEP parameters α / γ constant , achieving uniform Pol II occupancies along the gene ( as in Fig . 4B , C ) , and we monitored the corresponding IC scores at steady - state . For fixed gene length L and elongation rate , IC is an increasing function of both the Pol II γ density ( Fig . 4D upper panels ) and the strength E of self - attraction ( Fig . 4E mid panel ) : the gene’s polymeric subchain undergoes a theta - like collapse [ 66 ] towards a globular state when the Pol II occupancy reaches a critical value ( Movie S1 ) , such transition occurring at lower threshold densities for stronger interactions ( | E | ) . Similar to standard self - interacting 9 homopolymers [ 67 , 68 ] , gene compaction strengthens with increasing gene length ( Fig . 4F , left panel ) , while maintaining a fixed average Pol II level . This reflects the cooperative nature of the theta - collapse [ 69 , 70 ] . At a constant average Pol II density , IC is a decreasing function of the Pol II elongation rate ( Fig . 4E upper panel ) . Indeed , the capacity of Pol II - bound monomers to stably interact depends on the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the elongating Pol IIs : shorter residence time of Pol II on a monomer ( compared to typical polymer diffusion time ) results in more transient Pol II - mediated interactions between monomers . Notably , biologically - relevant elongation rates ( ~ 2kb / min , [ 71 ] ) correspond to the ‘slow’ elongation regime , maximizing gene compaction . Overall , our model qualitatively recapitulates the global Pol II and gene length trends observed experimentally ( Fig . 2B ) . However , the predicted strengths of intra - gene contact enrichment are much stronger than expected ( Fig . 4F left panel ) . For instance , a 128kbp - long gene shows a ~ 6 - fold increase in IC score with a ~ 8 - fold rise in Pol II density across the theta - collapse ( for γ = 2kb / min and E = - 3 kT ) , whereas experimentally the same change in average Pol II occupancy yields only ~ 35 % increase in IC . We verified that reducing | E | does not resolve the problem as the theta - transition remains sharp and cooperative ( Fig . S17 left panel ) . Intra - gene compaction in mESC is consistent with a limited valency of Pol II - Pol II interactions In our initial model , unrestricted interactions were allowed among the Pol II - occupied monomers in close proximity in the 3D space . However , such molecular interactions are mediated by only a restricted set of accessible residues and thus one monomer may have only a limited valency ( number of simultaneous interactions ) . Reducing the valency led to a global , sharp drop in intra - gene contact enrichment ( Fig . 4D , 4E lower panels , Movie S2 ) . For instance , at high Pol II occupancy , a ~ 11 - fold reduction in IC score was observed for valency 2 compared to unlimited valency . At lower valencies ( 2 or 3 ) , the levels of compaction aligned with experimental values ( Fig . 4F right panel , Fig . S17 right panel ) while still preserving the overall dependence on Pol II density and gene length see with unlimited valency . However , an intriguing exception emerged : the IC score now displays a non - monotonic dependency with Pol II levels ( Fig . 4E lower panel ) , as actually observed experimentally at high IR scores ( Fig . 1C ) . Within our framework , this behavior arises from a screening effect on long - range interactions . At high Pol II density , the neighboring Pol II - occupied monomers along the chain are likely to engage in interactions , limiting the ability of a monomer to interact with distantly located monomers and consequently reducing large - scale gene compaction . Nonuniform Pol II profiles lead to intra - gene architectural details We previously focused on average gene folding properties by considering flat , homogeneous Pol II densities . However , experimental Pol II profiles show distinct peaks at TSS and TTS . By adjusting the TASEP parameters , we generated qualitatively similar peaked profiles of increasing density ( Fig . 4G , Materials and methods ) . Using interacting parameters ( E = - 3kT , valency = 2 ) compatible with the experimental IC vs IR relationship , we predicted the formation of 10 a stable loop between TSS and TTS in Hi - C map as well as promoter - gene stripes within gene body , for high Pol II occupancy ( Fig . 4H lower panels ) . Interestingly , off - diagonal pileup analysis of mESC Micro - C datasets around TSS - TTS anchors exhibits similar patterns independent of the cohesin loop - extrusion mechanism ( Fig . 4H upper panels , Fig . S18 ) , implying that such architectural details are driven by Pol II occupancy and effective Pol II - Pol II interactions . Modeling predicts a coupling between transcription and chromatin dynamics Stochastic dynamics of gene folding in response to transcription bursting Most mammalian genes undergo discontinuous transcription in bursts [ 72 – 74 ] . To address the impact of such bursting kinetics on the gene spatio - temporal dynamics , we modified the TASEP model minimally : the promoter can stochastically switch between an “on” state , enabling Pol II binding and transcription , and an “off” state refractory to Pol II binding , with rates and 𝑘 𝑜𝑛 𝑘 𝑜𝑓𝑓 ( Fig . 5A ) . These rates define the effective Pol II binding rate ( ) , the α 𝑒𝑓𝑓 = α𝑘 𝑜𝑛 / ( 𝑘 𝑜𝑛 + 𝑘 𝑜𝑓𝑓 ) burst frequency ( , mean number of bursts per time unit ) and the train size = 𝑘 𝑜𝑛 𝑘 𝑜𝑓𝑓 / ( 𝑘 𝑜𝑛 + 𝑘 𝑜𝑓𝑓 ) ( , mean number of Pol II binding and elongating during one burst ) . For simplicity , we = α / 𝑘 𝑜𝑓𝑓 assumed , allowing variation in burst properties from rare , long trains ( k = 0 . 01 / min ) 𝑘 𝑜𝑛 = 𝑘 𝑜𝑓𝑓 ≡𝑘 to frequent , short ones ( k = 0 . 04 / min ) ( Fig . 5B , C ) , while maintaining an almost constant average Pol II density profile ( Fig . 5D ) . By averaging over all configurations , we observed a weak - but significant - decrease in intra - gene compaction in the presence of bursting ( Fig . 5E ) . However , when considering the promoter’s on / off states separately , the impact of bursting became apparent with overall higher compaction and more pronounced TSS - TTS loops and promoter - gene stripes in the on - state ( Fig . 5G ) . This effect was more pronounced for low burst frequency as the difference in Pol II occupancy between the on / off - states became more prominent ( Fig . 5F ) . Similarly , more elongating trains leads to increased compaction ( Fig . S19 ) . These findings suggest a time - correlation between transcriptional bursting and gene compaction where dynamical changes in the gene’s radius of gyration ( RG ) are preceded by modifications in Pol II along the gene ( Fig . 5H ) . Indeed , we observed an overall negative correlation between instantaneous Pol II density and RG , which was more pronounced for low burst frequencies ( Fig . 5 I , J ) . Interestingly , when multiple trains are present simultaneously along the gene , the dynamic looping between could rise to the formation of ‘factories’ where they colocalize ( Fig . 5K , Movie S3 ) . 11 Fig . 5 .

Transcription slows down gene mobility Live - imaging experiments have indicated that chromatin motion is enhanced after Pol II inhibition or reduced after gene activation [ 41 , 43 , 44 ] , suggesting a connection between transcription and a reduced gene mobility . To assess whether our biophysical model aligns with these observations , we computed for each monomer the mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) , that measures the typical space explored by a locus over a time - lag Δt . We observed that , where and are diffusion constant and exponent , respectively ( Fig . 6A ) . 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ~ 𝐷∆𝑡 δ 𝐷 δ δ ∼ 0 . 5 is independent of Pol II occupancy ( Fig . 6B ) and its value is consistent with standard polymer dynamics [ 75 , 76 ] . Conversely , depends on Pol II density and gene length ( Fig . 6C ) with a 𝐷 perfect opposite trend as the intra - gene compaction ( Fig . 4F right ) : the more compact the gene the less mobile [ 76 ] . For example , a 40 - 70 % increase in compaction corresponds to a 10 - 15 % decrease for , consistent with experiments ( Fig . 6C , D ) . 𝐷 Fig . 6 . Transcription activity slows down gene mobility .

On the Micro - C map of mESC , we observed selective contact enrichments between distal highly active genes ( Fig . 7 , Fig . S20 ) . For instance , the average contact frequency between the 811 kb - distant large active genes Ahctf1 and Parp1 is 3 . 2 - fold higher than expected at similar genomic distance ( Fig . 7A ) . Both genes belong to the same A compartment , indicating that strongly transcribed genes may form an independent subcompartment within A . To test this hypothesis , we clustered all the 32 - 64 kb - long genes into three categories based on their IR score ( Low , Mid and High ) and performed PMGA ( Materials and methods ) of the inter - gene contacts for pairs of genes distant by more than 128 kb but less than 2 Mb ( Fig 7B , Fig . S21 ) . When both genes are transcribed ( Mid and 14 High clusters in Fig 7B ) , a strong promoter - promoter interaction is detected . Moreover , highly active genes ( High - High ) showed significant contact enrichment between their gene bodies compared to the surrounding background , which was transcription - dependent and independent of loop extrusion ( Fig . S21 ) . Contact enrichment between inactive genes ( Low - Low ) is similar to background and can be attributed to their location in the more compact B compartment [ 30 ] . To rationalize these observations with our biophysical model , we conducted simulations for two 100 kbp - long genes distant by 200 kb , exhibiting similar steady - state Pol II profiles ( Fig . 7C ) . We observed that Pol II - mediated interactions not only affect intra - gene contacts but also drive the formation of inter - gene contacts between TSS and TTS and between gene bodies , whose strengths increase with Pol II density . Interestingly , interacting genes tend to colocalize and segregate from the rest of the simulated polymeric chain [ 77 , 78 ] ( Fig . 7D , Movie S4 ) . Discussion In this study , we analyzed publicly - available Micro - C data of mESC [ 14 , 29 ] to investigate the relationship between transcriptional activity and chromosome organization . At the single - gene level ( 2kbp - 1Mbp ) , intra - gene contact enrichment , structural patterns ( gene - loops , promoter - stripes , Fig . 3E ) and the degree of insulation from the surrounding genomic regions correlate positively with Pol II occupancy along the gene and gene length ( Fig . 1 , 2 ) . This is to contrast with the very local structure of the chromatin fiber ( < 600bp ) that is increasingly open as transcription rate increases [ 25 ] . For highly expressed genes , we observed reduced gene body compaction ( Fig . 1C ) , which aligns , although at a lesser extent , with the extended gene conformations observed for very long , highly expressed tissue - specific genes in mice [ 37 , 39 ] . In good agreement with recent high - precision Capture Micro - C data [ 27 ] , we demonstrated that such structure - function relation between gene compaction and gene transcription does not directly associate with loop extrusion [ 77 ] ( Fig . 3 ) , although the latter is known to drive loops and TADs formation [ 11 ] and to interfere with transcriptional elongation [ 38 , 46 , 47 ] . At the inter - gene level , we observed long - range contacts between active genes , not only between gene promoters as already characterized [ 79 , 80 ] , but also between gene bodies ( Fig . 7 ) , here also closely tied to Pol II profiles and independent of loop extrusion ( Fig . S21 ) . Altogether , our findings suggest that active genes are central units of the 3D genome [ 25 ] and form a subcompartment [ 27 , 77 , 78 ] , driven by gene activity , Pol II binding and elongation . This observation likely holds true for other cell types , as we recently showed that intra - gene compaction during mouse thymocyte maturation is , in average , associated with change in transcription levels [ 31 ] . The mechanisms described here are also likely to be broadly conserved in animals . Indeed , we analyzed the correlation between IC and IR ( spearman’s ρ = 0 . 48 ) in whole - embryo Drosophila data at embryonic nuclear cycle 14 ( Fig . S22 ) [ 81 ] . Drosophila is interesting as its chromosome organization is believed to be mainly driven by the spatial segregation of the epigenome instead of cohesin loop - extrusion processes [ 4 ] . We found a similar nonmonotonic dependence of IC to IR as well as Pol II - related intra - gene interaction patterns . One exception is the effect of gene length that is less clear . Interestingly , in the 15 bacterium Escherichia coli , higher transcription is also associated with more intra - gene contacts [ 82 ] ; in yeast and dinoflagellate , TAD - like structures are associated with ( blocks of ) active genes [ 25 , 83 ] . To better characterize the underlying mechanisms behind the correlations between Pol II activity and the transcriptionally - active subcompartment , we introduced a simple biophysical framework that accounts for the 1D dynamics of Pol II along genes coupled to the 3D polymer organization of chromosomes ( Fig . 4 ) . By assuming self - attractive , short - range interactions between genomic loci bound to Pol II [ 35 , 48 ] , the model is able to recapitulate qualitatively the overall augmentation of intra - gene compaction associated to an enrichment of Pol II density inside gene body and to longer genes , consistent with a standard cooperative coil - globule transition observed for finite - size chains [ 70 , 84 – 86 ] . Our model suggests that limiting the number of possible interactions per Pol II - bound region to low values ( e . g . , 2 or 3 ) allows to align quantitatively our predictions with experiments , leading to percolated but less compact 3D domains [ 87 , 88 ] . Interestingly , this constraint also explains the weak decompaction observed for highly transcribed genes as interactions between distant positions along the genes ( mediating the large - scale gene’s compaction ) are screened by ( more frequent ) interactions between nearest - neighbor Pol II - bound sites . This screening mechanism may also contribute to the formation of the extended transcription loops observed in long highly - transcribed genes [ 37 ] , along with the potential stiffening of the chromatin fiber caused by the high density of nascent ribonucleoprotein complexes along the genes , as originally evoked . Furthermore , our model predicts a strong coupling between gene structure and dynamics : transcription bursts may regulate the stochasticity of intra - and inter - gene contacts at the single - cell scale ( Fig . 5 ) [ 89 ] ; such dynamical contacts may conversely reduce locally gene mobility ( Fig . 6 ) and lead to long - range coherent motion between active regions [ 56 , 90 ] , in good agreement with live - microscopy observations [ 41 , 43 , 45 ] . What are the molecular determinants of the putative attractive interaction between Pol II - bound loci hypothesized in our model ? It is likely that several sources may directly or effectively participate in its regulation . The C - terminal domain ( CTD ) of Pol II can form liquid condensates in vitro under physiological conditions , which become unstable upon CTD phosphorylation [ 58 ] . This mechanism may thus promote direct attractions in vivo between non - elongating Pol II , bound at promoters for example [ 35 ] . CTDs may also interact with co - factors that can themselves phase - separate both at the transcriptional initiation [ 34 , 91 , 92 ] and elongation [ 59 , 93 ] stages , like FUS , BRD4 , Mediator , P - TEFb or splicing factors . For example , the observed correlation between intra - gene compaction and the number of exons [ 19 ] at similar Pol II occupancy ( Fig . S4 ) suggests a role for splicing - related condensates [ 93 ] . In addition , transcription - generated supercoiling [ 82 , 94 ] or specific histone marks deposited along the gene bodies ( that may regulate putative nucleosome - nucleosome interactions [ 95 ] ) may contribute to transcription - dependent effective interactions . The limited valency of interactions in our model aligns with a restricted number of simultaneously accessible residues involved in the aforementioned sources of Pol II - Pol II attraction . It is also possible that the screening effect observed at high transcription rates could be explained by the strength of interaction depending on local Pol II concentration and / or the 16 length of nascent transcripts ( Supplementary Notes ) , as RNA size and concentration can impact the stability of transcription - related condensates [ 62 ] . In conclusion , our results demonstrate the significant impact of Pol II binding and elongation on the spatiotemporal organization of the active genome through an out - of - equilibrium phase - separation process coupling the time - dependent dynamics of transcription to the formation of gene micro - domains and of transcriptionally - active subcompartment [ 60 , 77 , 96 ] . This extends the concept of transcription factories [ 97 ] , typically associated with inter - gene contacts , to the internal organization of long genes having multiple trains of transcribing Pol IIs . Consistent with our findings , recent works also proposed that interactions between Pol IIs may also facilitate promoter - enhancer communications [ 22 , 23 ] . However , our approach provides only an “average” picture of the role of transcription on 3D chromosome organization and does not account for the various epigenetic , genomic and spatial factors that may interplay with Pol II - mediated phase separation [ 47 ] around specific genes , potentially explaining the variability of behaviors observed after transcription ( de ) activation [ 31 ] . Future investigations should aim to further elucidate the biological function ( s ) of such transcription - dependent micro - compartmentalization . Indeed , colocalization of active genomic regions may enhance the recycling of Pol II or transcription co - factors [ 98 , 99 ] by increasing their local concentrations . Investigating precisely such a “structure - function” coupling between the binding and assembly of transcription - associated components and condensates and the spatial folding of the genome remains an intriguing challenge and would require further developments both at the experimental and modeling levels . Materials and Methods Experimental data analysis Datasets The processed Micro - C data for mESCs ( wild - type and mutants ) and Drosophila in multi - resolution format mcool were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) through accession no : GSE130275 , GSE178982 and ArrayExpress accession E - MTAB - 9306 . The ChIP - seq tracks , including Pol II , CTCF , RAD21 and H3K36me3 , for wild type and different mutants in BigWig format were downloaded from GEO through accession no : GSE130275 , GSE178982 , GSE90893 , GSE90994 , GSE16013 , GSE85191 . Pileup meta - gene analysis ( PMGA ) Contact maps We used cooltools ( https : / / github . com / open2c / cooltools ) [ 100 ] module to compute the obs / exp maps from the balanced contact maps , at various resolutions ranging from 100bp to 50kb . 17 To perform intra - gene PMGA , for each gene with size ( > 20 x resolution ) , we considered a 𝑖 𝑙 𝑖 domain of size around it , including the gene body and the two upstream and downstream 3𝑙 𝑖 flanking regions , each of size . To insure consistency and facilitate pileup analysis , we 𝑙 𝑖 rescaled each corresponding obs / exp matrix to a ( 60 , 60 ) - pseudo - sized matrix by ( 3𝑙 𝑖 ) 𝑥 ( 3𝑙 𝑖 ) averaging the original matrix elements . An example of this rescaling process can be seen in Figure S23 . We then aligned all the rescaled matrices in the transcription forward direction to maintain uniformity . Finally , we aggregated all the data of genes belonging to a given cluster ( clustered by gene length , IR score , . . . ) . For inter - gene PMGA , for each pair of genes , we considered the off - diagonal region of the obs / exp map of size and centered at ( ) , with and the size and genomic ( 3𝑙 1 ) 𝑥 ( 3𝑙 2 ) 𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 𝑙 1 𝑚 1 position of the middle of gene 1 ( same for gene 2 ) . Then , similarly , we rescaled this region to a ( 30 , 30 ) - pseudo - matrix , aligned the genes in parallel forward direction and aggregated the pseudo - matrices belonging to the same cluster . ChIP - seq tracks Using pyBigWig ( https : / / github . com / deeptools / pyBigWig ) , for each gene , we discretized the 3𝑙 domain ( see above ) into 60 bins and computed the coverage for each bin . Then , we aligned the domains in the transcription forward direction and aggregated over all genes in the same cluster . ChIP - seq peak calling and calculation of peak contacts For each ChIP - seq track , we transformed BigWig to bedGraph , used MACS software [ 101 ] version 2 to call the peaks in the “no model” mode and merged the results from different replicates . Then , we sorted them by fold - change score ( compared to input ) and selected the most significant peaks ( top 1 / 3 ) . Finally , for every pair of peaks with a genomic distance between 160 and 320 kb , we used the off - diagonal pileup module of cooltools to compute the average peak contacts . Insulation score and compartments analysis For computing the insulation score , we analyzed contact maps at 800 - bp , 1600 - bp and 3200 - bp resolutions with the dedicated module of cooltools with sliding windows 3 , 5 , 10 and 25 times larger than the given resolution , e . g . 2 . 4 , 4 , 8 and 20 - kb windows for 800 - bp resolution . For the compartment analysis , we used the eigs _ cis module of cooltools to compute the first eigenvector of the Pearson’s correlation matrix of contact map taking as inputs the 6 . 4 - kbp resolution Micro - C maps and the GC coverage computing from mm10 reference genome . Biophysical model We previously introduced a self - avoiding semi - flexible polymer model for chromosomes [ 55 , 56 ] . In this study , we employed a coarse - graining approach to represent a 20 - Mbp - long chromatin fiber using 10 , 000 monomers . Each monomer corresponds to approximately 2 - kbp of the 18 genome and has a size of 50 nm ( Fig . 4A ) . Within this chain , we inserted a 100 - kbp - long gene ( composed of 50 monomers ) , where TSS and TTS are located at the first and last monomers of the gene , respectively . TASEP model Each monomer i within a gene ( of total size n ) is characterized by a binary state 𝑠 𝑖 ϵ { 0 , 1 } depending if a Pol II complex is bound to it ( ) or not ( ) . We simulated the stochastic 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 𝑠 𝑖 = 0 dynamics of Pol II binding , unbinding and elongation using a simple kinetic Monte - Carlo framework : each Monte Carlo step ( MCS ) consisted of ( i ) one attempt to bind a Pol II with rate 𝛼 at the TSS if unoccupied ( ) , ( ii ) one attempt to unbind Pol II with rate 𝛽 at the TTS if 𝑠 1 = 0 → 1 occupied ( ) , and ( iii ) n - 1 elongation attempts , each consisting in randomly picking 𝑠 𝑛 = 1 → 0 one monomer i in [ 1 : n - 1 ] and , if occupied , to move with rate 𝛾 the Pol II to its adjacent upstream monomer iff it is not already occupied ( ) . [ 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 , 𝑠 𝑖 + 1 = 0 ] → [ 0 , 1 ] Polymer model The polymer chain undergoes local movements on a FCC lattice with periodic boundary conditions under Metropolis criterion , as described in our previous works [ 55 ] . The total Hamitonian of a given configuration can be expressed as following : . 𝐻 = κ 𝑖 = 2 𝑁−1 ∑ 1 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠θ 𝑖 ( ) + 𝐸 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∑ 𝑓 𝑖𝑗 𝑠 𝑖 𝑠 𝑗 The first term accounts for the stiffness of the chain with the bending rigidity and the local κ θ 𝑖 bending angle at monomer . The second term represents the Pol II - Pol II interaction , where 𝑖 𝐸 denotes the attractive interaction strength , and equals 1 if monomers and occupy nearest 𝑓 𝑖𝑗 𝑖 𝑗 neighboring sites on the lattice . For simulations with a limited valency number , we defined an interaction list for each monomer with . This list stores the genomic positions of the other monomers it interacts with and is 𝑠 𝑖 = 1 constrained not to exceed the given valency number . It is updated after any polymer or TASEP moves . Note that , due to the relatively high stall force of Pol II ( ~ 25 - 30 pN [ 102 ] ) , we assumed that Pol II - Pol II interactions do not impede Pol II elongation . Numerical simulations In our study , we set and a lattice volumic density of 50 % to account for a chromatin κ ∼ 1 . 2 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 fiber with a Kuhn length of 100 nm [ 68 , 103 ] and a typical base - pair density found in mammalian and fly genomes ( ~ 0 . 01 bp / nm³ ) [ 104 ] . Simulations were initiated by unknotted configurations [ 55 ] and performed with a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm . In addition to the TASEP moves ( see above ) , each MCS contains N local polymer trial moves . For each parameter set , 20 19 independent trajectories were conducted , discarding the first 10 ⁶ MCS from each trajectory to allow the system to reach a steady state . Subsequently , snapshots of the system were saved every 10³ MCS during the simulation during 10 ⁷ MCS and analyzed subsequently ( see below ) . Data analysis The radius of gyration ( RG ) provides a measure of the typical spatial extent of a gene , reflecting its overall span in 3D space . In a given configuration , the position of monomer can be defined 𝑖 as . The RG is then calculated as follows : 𝑟 → 𝑖 ≡ 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝑧 𝑖 ( ) 𝑅𝐺 = 1 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑟 → 𝑖 − 𝑟 → 𝑚 ( ) 2 , where is the mean position of all monomers . 𝑟 → 𝑚 ≡ 𝑥 𝑚 , 𝑦 𝑚 , 𝑧 𝑚 ( ) To extract the diffusion coefficient ( ) and exponent ( ) for monomer , we first computed the 𝐷 𝑖 α 𝑖 𝑖 time - averaged and ensemble - averaged mean - squared displacement , , as a function < 𝑀𝑆𝐷 𝑖 > of the time - lag , . Subsequently , we performed a power - law fit of the form to the △𝑡 𝐷 𝑖 △𝑡 α 𝑖 resulting curve using Numpy function numpy . polyfit ( log , log , 1 ) . △𝑡 < 𝑀𝑆𝐷 𝑖 > Furthermore , to establish a correspondence between simulation ( MCS ) and real ( seconds ) times , we compared our predictions with the typical MSD observed in yeast ( ~ , with in seconds ) [ 75 ] , leading to 1 MCS ~ 3 msec . 0 . 01 ( µ𝑚 2 / 𝑠𝑒𝑐 0 . 5 ) △𝑡 0 . 5 △𝑡 Data and code availability Processed data ( intra - gene contact , RNAseq and ChIPseq enrichments , compartments and exon numbers for each gene > 1kbp ) , Python notebooks for PMGA analysis and simulation codes are available on GitHub ( https : / / github . com / physical - biology - of - chromatin / Transcription ) .
