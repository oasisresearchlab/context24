A RT I C L E S Wdr1 - mediated cell shape dynamics and cortical tension are essential for epidermal planar cell polarity Chen Luxenburg 1 , 2 , 3 , Evan Heller 1 , 3 , H . Amalia Pasolli 1 , Sophia Chai 1 , Maria Nikolova 1 , Nicole Stokes 1 and Elaine Fuchs 1 , 4 During mouse development , core planar cell polarity ( PCP ) proteins become polarized in the epidermal plane to guide angling / morphogenesis of hair follicles . How PCP is established is poorly understood . Here , we identify a key role for Wdr1 ( also known as Aip1 ) , an F - actin - binding protein that enhances coﬁlin / destrin - mediated F - actin disassembly . We show that coﬁlin and destrin function redundantly in developing epidermis , but their combined depletion perturbs cell adhesion , cytokinesis , apicobasal polarity and PCP . Although Wdr1 depletion accentuates single - loss - of - coﬁlin / destrin phenotypes , alone it resembles core PCP mutations . Seeking a mechanism , we ﬁnd that Wdr1 and coﬁlin / destrin - mediated actomyosin remodelling are essential for generating or maintaining cortical tension within the developing epidermal sheet and driving the cell shape and planar orientation changes that accompany establishment of PCP in mammalian epidermis . Our ﬁndings suggest intriguing evolutionary parallels but mechanistic modiﬁcations to the distal wing hinge - mediated mechanical forces that drive cell shape change and orient PCP in the Drosophila wing disc . PCP , the collective polarization of cells within a tissue plane , is an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of epithelial tissues 1 – 3 . Mouse skin development aﬀords an excellent model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying this process in mammals . Epidermal cells use PCP as early as embryonic day 14 . 5 ( E14 . 5 ) , when core PCP proteins become asymmetrically localized along the anterior – posterior faces of basal layer cells 4 . When conserved PCP components Fzd6 ( frizzled - 6 ) , Celsr1 ( flamingo ) and Vangl2 ( strabismus ) are mutated , perturbations arise in anterior – posterior distributions of other PCP components leading to misangling of emerging hair follicles 4 , 5 . HowPCPisestablishedisstillunfolding . In Drosophila , contraction of the developing wing hinge exposes wing - blade epithelial cells to anisotropic tension along the proximal – distal axis , which in turn , leads to oriented elongation , rearrangement and divisions that realign cell polarization along this axis 6 . Moreover , hinge severing eliminates these forces and alters tissue dynamics and PCP alignment . Whether mechanical forces function in PCP - driven events in other organisms / tissues and if so , by what molecular mechanisms , are unexplored questions in developmental biology 7 . Although not investigated in the context of mammalian PCP , pronounced changes in shape accompany the ability of mouse epidermal cells to maintain spindle orientation . Indeed , if progenitors within the innermost , basal layer cannot round up as they enter mitosis , spindle orientation defects arise 8 . In vivo , epidermal mitotic rounding is regulated by the actin - regulated transcription factor SRF ( ref . 8 ) . In vitro , Wdr1 is also involved 8 – 10 . Studies from other systems suggest that the eﬀects of Wdr1 depend on its physical interaction with F - actin , as well as its association with members of the cofilin family of actin - binding proteins 11 – 17 . However , the mechanisms by which Wdr1 exerts its physiological roles in mammalian systems in vivo are poorly understood . In the mouse , its loss is lethal 18 , whereas in yeast , it has no obvious phenotype 17 . In the present study , we show that , unexpectedly , Wdr1 depletion in embryonic mouse epidermis results in a striking PCP phenotype . In pursuing a mechanism , we discovered that , like the Drosophila wing disc , mouse epidermal basal cells change their shape and orientation during PCP establishment . Combining laser ablation with video microscopy , we further show that coincident with the timing of 1 The Rockefeller University , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Laboratory of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development , New York , New York 10065 , USA . 2 Present address : Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv 69978 , Israel . 3 These authors contributed equally to this work . 4 Correspondence should be addressed to E .

Finally , we show that Wdr1 is an important mediator of epidermal tension through its ability to promote cofilin - mediated actin severing , without which PCP cannot be established . Overall , our findings unravel importantinsights intothephysiological rolesofWdr1 - mediated actin dynamics and mechanical / geometrical cues in PCP . RESULTS Cytoskeletal and PCP phenotypes in Wdr1 - deﬁcient skin To study the role of Wdr1 in vivo , we injected the amniotic sacs of E9 . 5 embryos in utero with high - titre lentivirus harbouring Wdr1 or scramble short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) and an H2B – GFP reporter gene 19 ( Fig . 1a ) . Western blot and phalloidin ( F - actin ) staining of Wdr1 - depleted basal cells revealed a striking increase in F - actin but not overall actin levels , consistent with the notion that Wdr1 functions as an enhancer of cofilin’s F - actin severing activity ( Fig . 1a – c ) . In control tissue , much of the F - actin was cortical and co - localized with E - cadherin . Without Wdr1 , the belt of intense F - actin staining extended internally from the cell borders . Adhesion between neighbouring epidermal cells and adherence to their underlying basement membrane seemed to be normal , as judged by ultrastructural analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Wdr1 - deficient epidermis also exhibited normal patterns of immunolabelling for adhesion proteins ( β 6 integrin , E - cadherin , ZO1 ) , basement membrane protein ( laminin - 5 ) and apicobasal polarity markers ( Par3 and centrosomes ; Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Probing deeper into the consequences of Wdr1 deficiency , we turned to the hair follicle . Instead of the characteristic anterior – posterior angling of their control counterparts , many of the follicles in Wdr1 - 368 - transduced embryos grew straight downward ( Fig . 1d ) . Quantifications revealed that in control backskins , < 4 % of hair follicles grew straight downward , whereas most hair follicles were oriented along the anterior – posterior axis ( Fig . 1e , f ) . In contrast , nearly 30 % of hair follicles pointed straight downwards in Wdr1 - depleted epidermis , and for those that were angled , their orientation was broader than normal . Also lost were the anterior – posterior asymmetries of E - cadherin and P - cadherin expression at the follicle tip , and of NCAM along the posterior side of the follicle shaft ( Fig . 1g ) . Whole - mount immunofluorescence microscopy also revealed a loss of the typical elongation of anterior hair follicle cells relative to their posterior counterparts ( Fig . 1h ) . These hair follicle defects are hallmarks of looptail and crash embryos 4 , which harbour mutations in thecorePCPgenes , Vangl2 and Celsr1 ( refs20 , 21 ) . Together , thesedata show that Wdr1 depletion in skin results in most if not all typical PCP abnormalities , including loss of molecular and cell shape asymmetry ofthebasalepidermalcellsatthejunctureofhairfollicledowngrowths , as well as randomization of follicle orientation within the developing hair coat . Wdr1 - depleted epidermis fails to establish PCP To determine whether Wdr1 activity aﬀects the localization of core PCP components , we analysed the distribution of Celsr1 between E13 . 5 and E15 . 5 . Before PCP establishment ( E13 . 5 ) , this atypical cadherin was largely unpolarized in both control and Wdr1 - deficient epidermis . By E14 . 5 , however , Celsr1 polarization in control basal cells had jumped from < 10 to 60 % , and the typical angle of polarity was largelyalongtheanterior – posterioraxis ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Incontrast , Celsr1 distribution in the basal layer cells of Wdr1 - deficient epidermis was noticeably perturbed . In some cells , its membrane localization was diminished ( asterisk ) whereas in others it was concentrated along the dorso - ventral axis ( arrowhead ) . Quantifications showed that < 30 % of cells showed Celsr1 polarization , and those that did exhibited a broader angle of polarity than control cells ( Fig . 2b , c ) . These defects werenotattributabletoadevelopmentaldelayinPCP , asperturbations werestillevidentatE15 . 5 ( Fig . 2a ) . Moreover , theoverallratiobetween membrane and cytoplasmic intensities of both Celsr1 and E - cadherin was not altered ( Fig . 2f ) , suggesting that these proteins maintain their cortical localization . ThePCPdefectsseenwith Wdr1 - 368 wererecapitulatedinembryos transduced with a second Wdr1 shRNA ( Wdr1 - 1622 ; Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Furthermore , a hairpin - resistant complementary DNA encoding a Wdr1 – GFP protein rescued the Wdr1 - knockdown ( KD ) PCP defects ( Fig . 2c – e and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . These results validated the specificity of our findings , and underscored the importance of Wdr1 in the process . Given the known link between cofilin family activity , adhesion and apicobasal polarity 13 , 22 , we examined E - cadherin and Par3 immunolocalization ( Fig . 2g ) . Importantly , the apical polarization of Par3 was maintained in Wdr1 - KD epidermis , indicating that loss of Wdr1 does not result in a general loss of tissue polarity . Furthermore , by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) , levels of messenger RNAs encoding E - cadherin , PCP proteins and key apicobasal polarity and cytoskeletal genes were normal ( Fig . 2h ) . Together , these results suggest that without Wdr1 , the epidermis cannot establish PCP , even though it still expresses its core constituents and maintains apicobasal polarity . Wdr1 cooperates with destrin / coﬁlin to establish planar and apicobasal polarity Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that Wdr1 is a potent enhancer of cofilin - mediated actin severing 10 , 23 , 24 . We thus explored the function of cofilin / destrin in establishing epidermal PCP and their relationship to Wdr1 . In control epidermis , cofilin , destrin and Wdr1 – GFP were all enriched at the periphery of basal cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Their immunofluorescence patterns were not obviously perturbed in Wdr1 - KD epidermis , suggesting that their general localization does not depend on Wdr1 in the skin ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . We next addressed whether epidermal loss of Cfl1 and / or Dstn mimics the Wdr1 - KD phenotype . To do so , we transduced E9 . 5 em - bryos in utero with shRNAs targeting Cfl1 ( Fig . 3b ) , and compared them with embryos harbouring a Dstn null allele ( Dstn corn1 ; refs 25 , 26 ) . We examined E - cadherin and Par3 immunolocalization as indicators of apical polarization and adhesion . In E15 . 5 backskins lacking one of the two cofilins , E - cadherin localization remained membranous , and the apical polarization of Par3 was maintained ( Fig . 3c , d ) . In these single mutants , the number of cells exhibiting Celsr1 anterior – posterior enrichment decreased subtly from 63 % in control E15 . 5 epidermis to 52 % and 55 % respectively ( Fig . 3c , d , g ) . However , a long - range Celsr1 labelling pattern was established in these mutants . To address the possibility that Cfl1 and Dstn function redundantly in the skin , we knocked down Cfl1 in Dstn corn1 embryos . In sharp contrast to single depletions , removal of both proteins resulted in NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2015 593 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved A RT I C L E S defects in adhesion , apicobasal polarity , cytokinesis and PCP ( Fig . 3e ) . Par3 localization within the basal layer was no longer excluded from the basal membrane . The typical PCP patterning of Celsr1 was also grossly disrupted , with more than a tenfold decrease in the number of polarized cells ( Fig . 3e , g ) . In contrast to double cofilin / destrin deficiency , Wdr1 deficiency aﬀected planar polarity but not apicobasal polarity ( Figs 2a – g and 3e ) . However , knockdown of Wdr1 in Dstn corn1 mice ( Dstn KO + Wdr1 ) yielded a phenotype similar to those of cofilin / destrin double mutants , where both apicobasal and planar polarity were grossly perturbed ( Fig . 3f , g ) . The eﬀects of destrin , cofilin and Wdr1 on PCP were quantified and are presented in Fig . 3g . These data underscore the impact of Wdr1 on cofilin / destrin function . They further suggest that when Wdr1 is absent , the F - actin - severing activity imparted by one of the cofilin / destrin pair is not suﬃciently high to compensate for loss of the other . IfWdr1functionsprimarilytoenhancecofilin / destrinactivity , then overexpressing a constitutively active mutant of cofilin ( CflS3A – GFP ; ref . 27 ) might be expected to compensate for the loss of Wdr1 . Although purified CflS3A does not exhibit enhanced enzymatic activity relative to wild - type cofilin 28 , its overexpression in cells is expected to increase F - actin severing by increasing the pool of cofilin capable of binding and severing actin 29 . Indeed , CflS3A – GFP restored Celsr1 localization in Wdr1 - KD em - bryos to the anterior – posterior pattern typical of PCP ( Fig . 4a , c ) . This was particularly intriguing , given that in wild - type embryos , constitu - tively active cofilin caused subtle perturbations in both apicobasal and planar cell polarity ( Fig . 4b , c ) . Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the phenotypic analyses of the data from Figs 3 and 4 . Together , these data suggestthatWdr1isacriticalenhancerofcofilinactivity , whichinturn must be tightly balanced for proper PCP establishment . Wdr1 is required for efﬁcient F - actin severing in keratinocytes How Wdr1 enhances cofilin activity is not fully understood . Several potential mechanisms have been proposed , including inhibiting the elongation of ADP – actin filaments with capping protein 23 and enhancing the lateral displacement of cofilin to promote actin severing 10 . It is nevertheless well established that Wdr1 has no catalytic activity of its own and that it exerts its role by interacting with both actin filaments and cofilins . To dig deeper into the link between the cytoskeletal and PCP phenotypes of Wdr1 - depleted epidermis and cofilin - mediated actin severing , we first examined endogenous levels of active ( unphosphorylated ) and inactive ( phosphorylated ) cofilin in lysates of cells expressing control and Wdr1 shRNAs , as well as cells overexpressing CflS3A – GFP in both a control and Wdr1 - depleted background . Wdr1 - depleted cells exhibited a ∼ 1 . 3 - fold increase in endogenous cofilin levels ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Figs 5c and 6a ) . This was surprising , because phalloidin staining in sagittal sections had indicated an increase in F - actin ( Fig . 1c ) . Indeed , western blot analysis in Wdr1 - depleted keratinocytes showed a ∼ 2 - fold increase in F - actin content ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Moreover , F - actin levels were restored to near wild - type levels when CflS3A – GFP was overexpressed in Wdr1 - KD cells . These results are consistent with previous in vitro studies suggesting that Wdr1 regulates actin severing not by modulating the pool of cofilin capable of binding actin through phosphorylation , but rather as a direct enhancer of cofilin - mediated actin severing 10 , 23 , 24 . Supporting this , the ability of Wdr1 - depleted cell lysates to sever exogenous , pyrene - labelled F - actin was reduced in comparison with scramble - shRNA controls , and could be rescued by CflS3A – GFP overexpression ( Fig . 5c ) . Wdr1 does not affect trafﬁcking of PCP proteins In contemplating how Wdr1 might aﬀect PCP , we were intrigued by a recent report that depletion of Cfl1 in looptail ( Vangl2 ) mutant mice accentuates PCP defects within the node and midline cells of early post - gastrulation ( E9 . 5 ) mouse embryos 30 . In that case , Cfl1 depletion seemed to exacerbate the PCP phenotype by perturbing the planar - polarized traﬃcking of Rab11 + vesicles to the apical membrane . In the epidermis , Rab11 is involved in the recycling of PCP proteins during mitosis 31 . In E14 . 5 Wdr1 - depleted backskin , however , both Rab11 localization and Celsr1 mitotic internalization seemed to be unperturbed ( Fig . 6a , b ) . This was also true under destrin / cofilin - deficient conditions ( Fig . 6c ) . Furthermore , mitotic epidermal cells of Wdr1 – GFP - transduced embryos revealed no obvious signs of Wdr1 internalization into Celsr1 - containing vesicles ( Fig . 6d ) . We also pursued possible parallels to loss - of - function defects in flare , the Drosophila orthologue of Wdr1 . Flare mutants exhibit a complex phenotype involving cell proliferation , viability and PCP defects 32 . Despite similarities in PCP defects , Wdr1 KD diﬀered from Flare in showing seemingly unperturbed cell proliferation , viability and diﬀerentiation in the developing mouse epidermis ( Fig . 6e , f ) . Moreover , Wdr1 KD did not overtly perturb the microtubule cytoskeleton , which has been reported to aﬀect PCP in Drosophila by regulating the delivery of core PCP proteins 33 . Wdr1 KD also showed no alterations in the primary cilium , some of whose components have been genetically linked to PCP defects 34 ( Fig . 6g ) . Overall , these results suggest that destrin / cofilin and / or Wdr1 may aﬀect PCP diﬀerently in diﬀerent organisms , tissues and / or developmental windows . Our findings suggest that Wdr1 and destrin / cofilin do not exhibit the typical behaviour of core PCP components ( anterior – posterior localization / polarized recycling ) , but rather act as mediators of PCP . We therefore returned our focus to the loss of PCP - mediated asymmetries in Wdr1 - depleted hair follicles ( Fig . 1e ) and the aberrations in mitotic rounding of basal epidermal cells ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . These defects in cell shape wereofparticularinterestgiventhatinthe Drosophila wingdisc , global cell shape dynamics are coupled to PCP reorientation 6 . Cell shape dynamics are regulated by Wdr1 and coincide with PCP establishment Although developmental cell shape changes have not been previously describedwithintheplaneofthemouseepidermalsheet , wewondered whether they might have been hitherto overlooked . To examine this , we used E - cadherin immunolabelling to delineate the epidermal cell borders of control and Wdr1 - depleted embryos during the period whenPCPisestablished . Surprisingly , automatedanalysesofcellshape revealed that from E12 . 5 ( non - polarized epidermis ) to E13 . 5 ( partially polarized ) to E14 . 5 ( polarized ) 4 , normal basal cells indeed underwent a striking change in both their shape and orientation ( Fig . 7a – d ) . During this process , cells decreased their surface area ( from 59 . 9 ± 0 . 8 594 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

In the Drosophila wing disc , external mechanical forces from the distant wing hinge drive both tissue dynamics and PCP alignment 6 . In mammalian epidermis , there is no apparent analogy for the forces exerted by the wing hinge .

Moreover , Wdr1 is essential for the assembly of contractile actin networks in the Caenorhabditis elegans myoepithelial sheath 36 , the ability of the mouse heart to contract 37 , and to recruit myosin II to the contractile ring during cytokinesis 10 .

Asterisks indicate statistical signiﬁcance at P < 0 . 05 . Scale bars , 10 µ m . Wdr1 activity is essential for cell ability to generate / maintain cortical tension At E14 . 5 , embryos were subjected to laser ablation and imaging ex vivo to estimate tension in the epidermis ( Fig . 8a ) . In scramble - shRNA control skin , laser ablation of membrane and cortical cytoskeleton 39 – 41 at a basal cell – cell interface yielded a mean initial retraction velocity ( a quantity proportional to tension ) of 0 . 214 µ ms − 1 versus 0 . 0534 µ ms − 1 in Wdr1 - deficient epidermis ( Fig . 8b ) . Similar results were obtained when cells were ablated along the anterior – posterior or dorsal – ventral axes . To explore the link between Wdr1 , actin severing , cortical tension and the establishment of PCP , we investigated whether CflS3A – GFP , which rescues actin severing in Wdr1 - depleted keratinocytes , can also rescue the cortical tension defects of Wdr1 - KD epidermis . In contrastto Wdr1 KDalone , Wdr1 KD + CflS3A – GFPepidermisshowed an initial retraction velocity of laser - ablated cell junctions that was essentially equivalent to scramble - shRNA epidermis ( 0 . 266 µ ms − 1 versus 0 . 214 µ ms − 1 , Fig . 8b ) . These findings imply a relationship between the regulation of actin severing and tension by Wdr1 and its role in establishing PCP . Consistent with this notion , loss of Wdr1 resulted in a striking reduction in the localization of myosin II at the cortex of basal epidermal cells ( Fig . 8c ) . Compared with adjacent , untransduced regions ( Fig . 8c , left ) , which exhibited tight localization of myosin II at the cortex , the myosin IIA network of Wdr1 - KD cells was more diﬀuse and extended into the cell interior ( Fig . 8c , right ) . If the tension defects we see in Wdr1 - depleted epidermis reflect perturbations in actomyosin - derived tension , then altering myosin II function 10 should generate similar defects . Although expression of multiple myosin II genes in embryonic epidermis precluded genetic analysis , we repeated our assays in E14 . 5 embryos exposed to either blebbistatin , which inhibits myosin II motor activity 42 , or Y27632 , 598 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

( b ) Loss of Wdr1 is associated with an increase in F - actin , and normal F - actin levels are restored when CﬂS3A – GFP is expressed in Wdr1 - KD keratinocytes . F - actin ( pellet ) , G - actin ( supernatant ) and total actin levels were determined by quantifying western blots and normalizing against control proteins ( see Supplementary Fig . 6 ) .

Data represent the mean ± s . e . m . from n = 4 independent mea - surements . Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 6 . which inhibits Rho kinase 43 . Indeed , these inhibitors resulted in modest increases in planar cell area and boundary tension defects similar to the loss of Wdr1 ( Fig . 8d , e ) . Given the increase in F - actin we observed in the absence of Wdr1 , we repeated our assays in E14 . 5 embryos exposed to jasplakinolide , a drug that stabilizes F - actin and leads to its ectopic accumulation 44 . Both cell area and boundary tension defects were nearly identical to those of Wdr1 - KD embryos ( Fig . 8d , e ) , illustrating that increasing F - actin levels in the epidermis leads to a reduction in cortical tension . Importantly , each of these pharmacological perturbations resulted in a disruption in planar polarity compared with dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) - treated embryos , with Celsr1 acquiring a more uniform , punctate distribution at the cortex ( Fig . 8f ) . Importantly , thestrikingdefectsincellshapeandepidermaltension werenotobservedinE14 . 5 Vangl2 ( looptail ) mutantembryos , suggest - ing that Wdr1 - mediated changes in cortical tension , organization of the actomyosin cortex , and epidermal architecture function upstream of PCP establishment ( Fig . 8d , e and Supplementary Fig . 3e ) . DISCUSSION During development , cells and tissues undergo structural , mechanical and geometrical remodelling that can be coupled to cell fate determination , diﬀerentiation and proliferation 45 , 46 . These fascinating mechanisms have been explored predominantly in cultured cells and invertebrate model organisms , and are still poorly understood in mammalian systems in vivo . Our study has unearthed pronounced changes in the shape and orientation of epidermal cells that occur within developing mouse skin . Moreover , we showed that the timing of these dynamic changes not only coincides with PCP establishment , but is also physiologically relevant to the process , as reflected by the striking defects in PCP that occur when the shape changes are perturbed . Our results further unveiled Wdr1 as a major regulator of cell shape dynamics in the skin . Our in vitro and in vivo data showed that depletion of Wdr1 increases F - actin content and perturbs the actin cytoskeleton . Interestingly , although loss of Wdr1 correlates with an increase in endogenous cofilin levels , it ultimately results in a decreased ability to sever F - actin . To understand this seemingly para - doxical result , it is important to note that , although phosphorylation by LIMK diminishes cofilin’s activity by abrogating its ability to bind F - actin 47 , 48 , actinseveringcanberegulatedbyothermeansthancofilin phosphorylation 49 . Even when it is bound , cofilin does not necessarily severF - actin .

Dotted lines denote the dermal – epidermal border . Scale bars , 10 µ m . The means by which Wdr1 enhances cofilin - mediated actin severing is a matter of debate . According to one view , Wdr1 and cofilin compete for the same binding site on F - actin , where the role of Wdr1 is to reduce cofilin binding to within an optimal range for severing 10 . Alternatively , Wdr1 could cooperate with cofilin to sever actin filaments rather than compete for the same binding site 24 . Our findingthatoverexpressionofconstitutivelyactivecofilinrescuesactin severing in Wdr1 - deficient cells is compatible with either model , as high levels of active cofilin are likely to override the requirement for Wdr1 either to competitively bind actin or to cooperate with cofilin to promote severing . The broader polarity and adhesion defects of combined cofilin / destrin deficiency in the skin suggest a special importance of Wdr1 in epidermal cell shape dynamics associated with PCP . 600 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The architecture of actin networks aﬀects myosin II activity 35 , and cofilin competes with myosin II for the F - actin binding site 50 . In line with this , our laser ablation studies demonstrated a significant decrease in boundary tension on loss of Wdr1 , suggesting that actomyosin - based tension was reduced . Moreover , as treating embryos with jasplakinolide revealed , increasing F - actin content within the developing embryonic epidermis perturbed rather than enhanced actomyosin tension and probably represented an extreme case of the Wdr1 loss - of - function phenotype . Whether these eﬀects are due to competitive binding of either cofilin or jasplakinolide at the expense of myosin II or more generally to organization of the actin cortex remains to be determined .

All rights reserved A RT I C L E S In closing , the link we unearthed between mammalian epidermal cell shape , actin severing , tension and PCP in some ways resembles Drosophila wing disc development 6 . However , in contrast to the fly wing disc , intrinsic forces seem to be at the root of this connection in the mouse epidermis . Our additional finding that PCP is linked to Wdr1 , cofilins and actin dynamics is interesting in light of the recent surfacing of cofilin ( Cfl1 ) in a genetic screen for PCP mutants in the early mouse embryo 30 . However , in contrast to the role for cofilins in orchestrating polarized vesicle traﬃcking 30 , our data indicate that cells within the developing epidermis are under considerable mechanical tension at the time when PCP is established , and rely on a Wdr1 / cofilin - based mechanism to govern the actomyosin dynamics that sculpt cell shapes and orient PCP . These findings unveil diversities in the complex relationship between the cells’ mechanical and geometrical cues and tissue development .

All rights reserved DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3146 M E T H O D S METHODS Mouse lines and lentivirus production and injection . The following mouse strains were used : CD1 ( Charles River Laboratories ) and Dstn corn1 ( Jackson Laboratories ) . With the exception of Dstn KO and Dstn KO / Cfl1 KD embryos , all experimentswereperformedonE14 . 5 – E18 . 5embryosobtainedbymatingwild - type CD1 males to CD1 females . Dstn KO and Dstn KO / Cfl1 KD embryos were obtained by mating homozygous Dstn corn1 males to homozygous females and injecting with a scrambled - sequence control shRNA or shRNAs against Cfl1 . Lentiviral shRNAs were obtained from the TRC - 1 Library ( Sigma ) . Production and injection of shRNA lentivirus was performed as described previously 19 . Briefly , females at E9 . 5 of gestation were anaesthetized with isoflurane ( Hospira ) and the sacs of up to eight embryos per litter were injected with 0 . 25 – 1 µ l of lentivirus ( ∼ 10 9 cfu ) . The Rockefeller University Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal experimentation protocols used in the study . Epidermalkeratinocyteswereisolatedandculturedfromdispase - treatedskinsof wild - type CD - 1 mice . For in vitro infections , cells were plated at 1 × 10 5 cells per 6 - wellplate , infectedwith > 10 9 cfulentivirusinthepresenceofPolybrene . Forty - eight hours after infection , cells were selected with 1mgml − 1 puromycin ( Sigma ) . The hairpin sequences used were as follows : Wdr1 - 368 ( TRCN0000108912 ) : 5 (cid:48) - GCTGGGAAGATCAAGGACATT - 3 (cid:48) ; Wdr1 - 1622 ( TRCN0000108914 ) : 5 (cid:48) - GA TGGCTATTCGGAGAATAAT - 3 (cid:48) ; Cfl1 ( TRCN0000071694 ) : 5 (cid:48) - CGCAAGTCTTC AACACCAGAA - 3 (cid:48) ; Vangl2 - 1738 ( TRCN0000124572 ) : 5 (cid:48) - GTTCTGCATTACCCA CGACAT - 3 (cid:48) .

For immunoreactions , skin sections ( 10 µ M ) were blocked with PBS , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % bovine serum albumin , 5 % normal goat serum , 5 % normal donkey serum , or MOM Basic kit ( Vector Labs ) . Primaryantibodieswereincubatedfor1hatroomtemperatureorovernightat4 ◦ C . Secondaryantibodieswereincubatedatroomtemperaturefor1h . Forwhole - mount immunofluorescence microscopy , embryos were fixed for 1h in 4 % formaldehyde , and primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C . Immunoblot analyses were performed as previously described 8 . Briefly , proteins wereextractedinRIPAbuﬀer . Sampleswererunon4 – 12 % gradientgels , transferred to nitrocellulose , and blotted overnight with the indicated antibodies . Blots were scannedonanOdysseyCLximager ( LiCor ) andquantifiedbyfluorescenceintensity . Antibodies . Primary antibodies used were : Wdr1 ( G - 13 , Santa Cruz ) , 1 : 100 ; Destrin ( ab11072 , abcam ) , 1 : 100 ; cofilin ( ab42824 , abcam ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ; HPRT ( ab10479 , abcam ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ; GAPDH ( ab8245 , abcam ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ; GFP ( ab13970 ) , 1 : 2 , 000 ; myosin II ( PRB - 440P , Covance ) , 1 : 200 ; pericentrin ( PRB - 432C , Covance ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ; E - cadherin ( ECCD - 1 , M . Takeichi , RIKEN , Japan ) , 1 : 500 ; CD104 ( β 4 integrin , 553745 BD - Pharmingen ) , 1 : 500 ; P - cadherin ( P - cad , Zymed ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Keratin14 ( PRB - 155P , Covance ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ; keratin 10 ( PRB - 159P , Covance ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Celsr1 ( Fuchs lab ) , 1 : 250 ; keratin 6 ( Rb 415 , Millipore ) , 1 : 500 ; PAR3 ( 07 - 330 , Millipore ) , 1 : 100 ; phospho - S3 - Cofilin ( 77G2 , Cell Signaling ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ; Rab11 ( D4F5 , Cell Signaling ) , 1 : 500 ; β - actin ( AC - 15 , Sigma ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ; γ - actin ( 2 - 2 . 1 . 14 . 17 , Sigma ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ; α - tubulin ( DM1A , Sigma ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ; acetylated tubulin ( 6 - 11B - 1 , Sigma ) , 1 : 1 , 000 . Secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC , rhodamine ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) , or Alexa Fluor 488 / 546 / 647 ( Invitrogen ) were diluted 1 : 1 , 000 ( sagittal sections ) or 1 : 200 ( whole mount ) , and samples were incubated 1h – overnight . F - actin was labelled with phalloidin – Alexa Fluor 546 / 647 ( Invitrogen ) . Microscopy and image processing . Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM780 laser - scanning confocal microscope with × 63 / 1 . 4 and × 40 / 1 . 4W objectives . Basic image adjustments were performed in Fiji ( ImageJ ) and Adobe Photoshop CS5 . Figures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator CS5 . Quantification of PCP and hair follicle orientation . Whole - mount samples from backskins were processed , labelled for Celsr1 and imaged as described above . Confocal analyses and data collection were conducted at a single horizontal plane through the middle of cells within the basal layer ( ∼ 3 – 4 µ m above the basement membrane ) . Background fluorescence was subtracted and a PCP - polarized cell was defined as a basal layer cell flanked by two distinct and opposing lateral domains of Celsr1 . To determine the angle of polarity , the ‘straight line’ tool in ImageJ was used to draw a line between the centres of the two opposing Celsr1 domains . To determine the hair follicle orientation , whole - mount samples from backskins were labelled for E - cadherin and imaged at low magnification in Z - stacks from the plane of the epidermis to the tips of hair follicles . Z - stacks allowed a clear observation of hair follicle angularity . Hair follicles were defined as ‘perpendicular’ if their angularity was 90 ◦ to the basal epidermal plane ; for angled hair follicles , the degree of angling was measured by using the ImageJ ‘straight line’ tool to draw a line between the base of the hair follicle and its tip . QuantificationofF - actincontentandactin - severingassays . Formeasurements of F / G - actin ratios , cells were lysed in F - actin stabilization buﬀer ( 50mM PIPES at pH6 . 9 , 50mM NaCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 5mM EGTA , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % beta - mercaptoethanol , 1mMATP , proteaseand phosphatase inhibitor cocktails ) at 37 ◦ . F - actin was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 150 , 000 g , reconstituted in an equal volume of ice - cold 10 µ M cytochalasin D , and incubated on ice for 1h . Actin in supernatant and pellets was quantified by western blot using G - actin standards ( Cytoskeleton ) . For actin - severing assays , cells were lysed in buﬀer containing 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM ATP , 2mM Tris , pH8 . 0 , 1mM EGTA , and 1 % Triton X - 100 and dialysed ( Slide - A - Lyzer 10K , Pierce ) to remove detergent . Pyrene - labelled F - actin ( Cytoskeleton ) was added to cell lysates at a final concentration of 3 . 8 µ M . Pyrene fluorescence was monitored for 1h using a POLARstar Optima fluorescence plate reader ( BMG Labtechnologies ) using 355nm excitation and 405nm emission filters . Cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide - treated lysates were used as negative and positive controls . Quantitative analysis of cell area and shape . Measurement of cell area and elongation was performed using custom MATLAB scripts . Confocal images of basal layerepidermiswerefilteredusingatwo - dimensionalband - passfilter , andcellswere segmented on the basis of cortical E - cadherin staining using a watershed algorithm . Cell elongation is defined as the ratio of major and minor axes of automatically segmented cells . For each set of measurements , > 2 , 000 cells were measured from > 3 embryos . Laser ablation . Laser ablation of the cell cortex was performed by targeting an ∼ 7 µ m 2 circular region on a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO system using a Ti : sapphire laser ( Chameleon Ultra , Coherent Scientific ) tuned to 800nm . Laser power and dwell timewerecalibratedperexperiment , butweretypicallyperformedbetween80 – 100 % transmission using scan speed 6 and 50 – 75 repetitions ( ∼ 90 – 140 µ s dwell time ) . Pharmacological inhibition of tension . Tension was inhibited in live E14 . 5 embryos by treating them with 50 µ M blebbistatin , 0 . 5 µ M jasplakinolide , 10 µ M Y - 27632 , or an equal volume of DMSO for 6h in Defined Keratinocyte Medium ( Life ) with 1 . 5mM CaCl 2 . Embryos were subjected to laser ablation studies or fixed for whole - mount immunostaining . Electron microscopy . For correlative light and electron microscopy , head skin was carefully dissected out from E16 . 5 embryos and cut into smaller samples . Samples were fixed in 4 % PFA , 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buﬀer for ∼ 4h . After washing with PBS , samples were permeabilized and blocked in a solution containing 1 % BSA , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , NH 4 Cl 50mM and incubated overnight in primary antibody ( GFP Rabbit IgG Polyclonal Antibody Fraction , Invitrogen , diluted 1 : 200 in the same solution ) . Samples were washed and incubated inbiotinylatedgoatanti - rabbitIgGantibody ( VectorLaboratories ) diluted1 : 200and thenprocessedwiththeVectastainABCreagent ( Vectorlaboratories ) , usingDABas an enzyme substrate . For , transmission electron microscopy , samples were fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M cacodylate buﬀer , followed by osmium tetroxide fixation and processed for electron microscopy as previously described 8 . Sections ( 1 µ m ) were stained for toluidine blue and examined for the presence of cells immunolabelled for GFP . An ultrathin section ( 70nm ) immediately consecutive to the semithin section was obtained from selected areas from wild - type and WDR1 - 368 skin respectively . Ultrathin sections were examined at the electron microscope . The area containing exactly the same cells as the semithin section was photographed and analysed at high magnification . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting . FACS purification of basal epidermal cells from CD1 E14 . 5 scramble - shRNA ; PGK – H2B – GFP - infected mice ( Ctrl ) or Wdr1 - shRNA ; PGK – H2B – GFP ( KD ) was performed on a FACS Vantage SE system equipped with FACS DiVa software ( BD Biosciences ) . Cells were gated for single eventsandviabilityandthensortedaccordingto α 6integrin – PEexpressionandGFP . For quantification of F - actin levels , primary mouse keratinocytes were infected with Scramble or WDR1 - KD virus , selected with puromycin , trypsinized , fixed and labelled with phalloidin – Alexa Fluor 647 . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR . Equal amounts of RNAs were added to a reverse - transcriptase reaction mix ( SuperScript VILO , Invitrogen ) , and semi - quantitative PCR was conducted with a LightCycler system ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Reactions were performed using the indicated primers and template mixed with the LightCycle DNA master SYBR Green kit and run for 50 cycles . Specificity of the reactions was determined by subsequent melting curve analysis . LightCycle analysis software was usedtoremovebackgroundfluorescence ( noiseband ) .
