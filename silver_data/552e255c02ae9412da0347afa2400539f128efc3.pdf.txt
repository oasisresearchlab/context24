Yearning : Race , gender , and cultural politics . Bell Hooks Hypatia 7 ( 2 ) : 177 - 187 ( 1992 ) AbstractAbstract A new collection of critical essays from bell hooks takes as its theme the deep longing for a critical voice . I explore some motifs that operate across the divergent topics of her essays . She writes of the dangers of commodification , of " reassuring " images , of individualism . I also explore the paths of hooks ' s uniquely black postmodernism : her critique of various essentialisms , her philosophically important conception of subjectivity , and her beautiful and powerful transformations of multiple discourses KeywordsKeywords No keywords specified ( fix it ) Categ ories Categ ories Feminist Philosophy in Philosophy of Gender , Race , and Sexuality Philosophy of Race in Philosophy of Gender , Race , and Sexuality ( categorize this paper ) OptionsOptions Y e a r n i n g : R a c e , G e n de r , a n d C u l t u r a l P o l i t i c s Y e a r n i n g : R a c e , G e n de r , a n d C u l t u r a l P o l i t i c s Edit this record Mark as duplicate Export citation Find it on Scholar Request removal from index    D o w n l o a d o p t i o n s D o w n l o a d o p t i o n s R e f e r e n ce s f o u n d i n t h i s w o r k R e f e r e n ce s f o u n d i n t h i s w o r k BETA No references found .
