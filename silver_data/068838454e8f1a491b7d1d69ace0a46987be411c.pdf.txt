We designed and tested two NFT protocols based on training alpha and beta EEG oscillations selectively measured over the right parietal region . A total of 80 participants were involved , 40 in the alpha NFT protocol and 40 in the beta NFT protocol . The NFT loop was closed on a video stream that would advance only when oscillation power exceeded a normalized threshold . The total duration of the protocol was two hours in a single day , hence its classi ﬁ cation as rapid . Changes in ideational ﬂ uency and originality , measured with a divergent thinking task , were compared between participants receiving real video feedback and participants receiving sham feedback . We controlled for individual di ﬀ erences in creative achievement level . Results showed that the protocols were e ﬀ ective at enhancing alpha and beta activities in the targeted area . Di ﬀ erences between the two protocols emerged in their e ﬀ ectiveness at promoting divergent thinking . While no signi ﬁ cant changes in originality re - sulted from the rapid alpha NFT , increases in both originality and ﬂ uency emerged as a consequence of the rapid beta NFT . These results were particularly evident in participants starting with a low creative achievement level . Possible interpretations and future directions are proposed and discussed . 1 . Introduction Creativity is undeniably one of the most complex and elusive human behaviors . Notwithstanding the long debate on the most appropriate de ﬁ nition of creativity , it is commonly accepted that it re ﬂ ects the capacity to produce works that are potentially original and e ﬀ ective ( Runco and Jaeger , 2012 ; Corazza , 2016 ) . The concept of originality includes both novelty and nonobviousness , whereas e ﬀ ectiveness refers to the value or appropriateness of the outcomes of the creative process ( Corazza , 2016 ) . The study of creativity at the neuroscienti ﬁ c level has pursued two main aims . On the one hand , research mainly based on electroencephalography ( EEG ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has focused on understanding the neural correlates of creative behavior ( Arden et al . , 2010 ; Beaty et al . , 2016 ; Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ; Jauk et al . , 2013 ; Jung et al . , 2010 ) . These techniques have been important for highlighting the brain networks that are as - sociated with creativity . However , fMRI and EEG provide correlational evidence , and cannot establish which brain regions or neural dynamics are critical for creative behavior . On the other hand , a growing body of studies has applied brain stimulation to directly interact with neuronal activity and show causal links between brain structures and creative behavior ( e . g . , Kleinmintz et al . , 2017 ; Luft et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly , since the pioneering work of Green et al . ( 1971 ) and of Sterman and Friar ( 1972 ) , psychophysiologists have developed EEG - based neuro - feedback approaches to enhance creative performance by non - in - vasively modulating speci ﬁ c EEG oscillations ( Gruzelier , 2014a ; Wei et al . , 2014 ; Zmigrod et al . , 2015 ) . The present study is set within the latter context by proposing a new procedure designed to increase creative performance based on rapid EEG neurofeedback training ( NFT ) . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neuropsychologia . 2018 . 02 . 015 Received 30 September 2017 ; Received in revised form 23 January 2018 ; Accepted 12 February 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author . 1 Co - ﬁ rst authorship .

T Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback that allows the user to take control over speci ﬁ c brain activities by means of operant conditioning ( Lopez - Larraz et al . , 2014 ; Gruzelier , 2014b ; Marzbani et al . , 2016 ) . In this way , users acquire control over certain brain activity patterns ( e . g . , EEG oscillations ) , and can implement these skills in daily life ( Gevensleben et al . , 2009 ) . Remarkably , NFT allows researchers to es - tablish a causal link between modi ﬁ ed brain activity and modi ﬁ ed behavior ( Watanabe et al . , 2017 ) and has recently gained increased attention , since it represents a non - invasive way to modulate cognitive states in normal and pathological conditions ( Lofthouse et al . , 2012 ; Marzbani et al . , 2016 ) . This is , for instance , shown by an increase in the number of publications about this technique in recent years ( from 286 papers from 2008 to 2012 to 863 papers from 2013 to 2017 ; search on PubMed in January 2018 , using “ neurofeedback OR neuro - feedback ” as query ) . NFT has been proposed as an enjoyable way to increase re - laxation and cope with work - related stress ( van Boxtel et al . , 2012 ) and as a practical method for improving a ﬀ ective and cognitive functions ( Egner and Gruzelier , 2004 ; Gruzelier , 2014b ; Guez et al . , 2015 ; Hosseini et al . , 2016 ) , mostly in clinical settings ( Coghill , 2010 ) . Previous NFT studies on creative performance have shown pro - mising results ( Egner and Gruzelier , 2003 ; Gruzelier et al . , 2014b ) , although they required training windows extending over several days or weeks . These studies were guided by the idea that reaching a state of deep relaxation would increase participants ’ creative potential , as , in such a state , their creative performance would be best expressed ( see Gruzelier , 2014a for a review ) . Accordingly , previous NFT studies have commonly focused on relatively slow EEG oscillations associated with closed - eye states of deep relaxation , i . e . , theta ( 4 – 8 Hz ) and alpha ( 8 – 14 Hz ) oscillations , particularly over central parietal electrodes ( Egner et al . , 2002 ; Gruzelier , 2014b ) . Gruzelier and collaborators re - peatedly demonstrated the e ﬃ cacy of alpha and alpha / theta NFT pro - tocols in increasing creative performance , especially in the artistic do - main ( Egner and Gruzelier , 2003 ; Raymond et al . , 2005 ; Gruzelier et al . , 2010 , 2014a ; Gruzelier , 2012 , 2014b ; see also Gruzelier et al . , 2014b ) . Beyond enhancing relaxation , NFT protocols can be used to enhance EEG patterns associated with speci ﬁ c cognitive processes . Interestingly , prior EEG studies have often reported that creative performance can be associated not only with a power increase in relatively slow oscillations ( e . g . alpha oscillations , which are generally associated with inhibited cortical states and relaxation ) but also with beta oscillations , which commonly re ﬂ ect active processes including cognitive control and at - tention ( Bhattacharya and Petsche , 2005 ; Danko et al . , 2009 ; Fink et al . , 2007 ; Fink and Benedek , 2014 ; Kounios et al . , 2008 ; Mölle et al . , 1999 ; Schwab et al . 2014 ; Razumnikova , 2004 ) . Thus , NFT procedures based on enhancing faster EEG oscillations appear to be a promising target for enhancing creativity . In the present study , we used NFT to investigate creative potential , i . e . , the potential to produce ideas that are both original and e ﬀ ective ( Corazza , 2016 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , we explored divergent thinking , i . e . , the ability to generate alternative responses by exploring many possible so - lutions . Divergent thinking represents the best characterization of creative potential ( Runco and Acar , 2012 ) and previous research has already de - monstrated that it can be e ﬀ ectively trained ( e . g . , Scott et al . , 2004 ) . We designed our NFT protocol based on previous EEG studies that used di - vergent thinking tasks to investigate brain dynamics involved in creative cognition ( Fink and Benedek , 2014 ; Runco and Yoruk , 2014 ) . Those stu - dies highlighted an association between creative performance and dif - ferent brain oscillations , particularly in the alpha and beta bands , both during active tasks and in a resting state ( Bhattacharya and Petsche , 2005 ; Fink et al . , 2007 ; Shemyakina and Dan ’ ko , 2007 ; Fink and Benedek , 2014 ; Mölle et al . , 1999 ) . They detected such activity mainly over right parietal regions ( Benedek et al . , 2011 , 2014 , 2016 ; Fink et al . , 2007 , 2010 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) . However , those EEG studies could not answer the critical question of whether an enhancement of alpha and / or beta oscillations might cause an increase in creativity . Answering this outstanding question is the goal of the present NFT study . 1 . 1 . Aims of the current study Using NFT , we sought to test the functional relevance of alpha and beta activity to divergent thinking . Building on previous EEG studies , we developed a novel NFT procedure to increase participants ’ creative performance , as measured through the ﬂ uency and originality of ideas produced in a divergent thinking task ( i . e . , the classic Alternative Uses Task , AU task ; Guilford , 1967 ) , by monitoring the EEG signal speci ﬁ - cally over the right parietal region ( Benedek et al . , 2011 , 2014 , 2016 ; Fink et al . , 2007 , 2010 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) and providing visual feedback when the activity in this region increased above a normalized threshold . We developed two distinct NFT protocols , i . e . , Alpha and Beta NFT protocols , in order to separately explore the e ﬃ cacy of NFT based on alpha and beta EEG oscillations . Importantly , we aimed to develop a rapid procedure , in order to deliver improvement within a single day . 1 . 2 . Hypotheses The change in brain activity over the right parietal region , as well as the change in creative performance in the divergent thinking task , were analyzed and contrasted during three NFT sessions delivered in a single day in four groups of participants . Two experimental groups ( alpha and beta NFT ) received visual feedback when the alpha or beta activity in the selected brain region exceeded a normalized threshold . Each ex - perimental group was matched to a corresponding control group ( alpha and beta sham ) that received sham feedback unrelated to brain activity . Speci ﬁ cally , to validate the e ﬃ cacy of the alpha and beta NFT proto - cols , a two - step experimental approach was implemented , based on the following hypotheses . In the ﬁ rst step , we tested whether the alpha and beta NFT protocols e ﬀ ectively changed brain oscillations , hypothesizing that the time during which alpha / beta activity in the right parietal region exceed the normalized threshold value should progressively increase in the training condition compared to the corresponding sham condition . As a second step , we tested the e ﬀ ect of NFT on participants ’ crea - tive performance , re ﬂ ected by ideational ﬂ uency and originality in the AU task . Importantly , if alpha and / or beta oscillations are not just epiphenomenally associated with creativity , but play a causal role in creative thinking , we would expect that alpha and / or beta NFT proto - cols would improve AU task performance , thus demonstrating a casual involvement of enhanced oscillatory activity in improved creative be - havior . In addition , we measured participants ’ lifetime creative achieve - ment , using the Creative Activity and Accomplishment Checklist ( Hocevar , 1981 ; Milgram and Hong , 1999 ; Paek et al . , 2016 ; Runco et al . , 1990 ) . This measure was necessary to control for individual di ﬀ erences in terms of creative success in real life , and to explore whether a median split over this variable ( i . e . , low vs . high creative achievers ) could explain di ﬀ erential outcomes of the NFT procedures . A number of studies on the e ﬀ ectiveness of cognitive training have indeed shown the importance of considering the moderating role of higher order individual di ﬀ erences on the e ﬀ ect of training ( e . g . , Jaeggi et al . , 2014 ) . Following this reasoning , we assumed that participants with lower creative abilities should particularly bene ﬁ t from NFT , i . e . , the increase in creative performance should emerge more prominently in participants characterized by a low lifetime creative achievement level . 2 . Method 2 . 1 . Participants A total of 80 female students from the University of Bologna took part in the experiment . Two separate protocols were performed to train oscillations in the alpha and beta bands . Forty participants were ran - domly assigned to the alpha NFT protocol ( mean age = 21 . 10 years , S . Agnoli et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 99 – 106 100 SD = 2 . 12 ; age range from 19 to 27 years ) , and 40 to the beta NFT protocol ( mean age = 20 . 64 years , SD = 2 . 38 ; age range from 18 to 27 years ) . Within each protocol , 20 participants were assigned to the ex - perimental ( training ) condition , and 20 to the control ( sham ) condition . All participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision , and none of them reported current or past neurological or psychopathological pro - blems on a medical history screening questionnaire , adapted from one that is routinely used in non - invasive brain stimulation studies ( see Rossi et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . They gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation . The experimental protocol conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Bioethics com - mittee of the University of Bologna . 2 . 2 . Procedure and instruments On arrival , participants were seated in a sound - attenuated room . They were introduced to the whole procedure and prepared for EEG recording . The experimental procedure was the same for all partici - pants , and was performed in a single day ( see Fig . 1 ) . In the pre - training phase , participants ’ EEG activity was recorded in two 3 - min EEG re - cordings at rest , the ﬁ rst with eyes closed ( EC block ) and the second with eyes open ( EO block , baseline ) . Subsequently , participants com - pleted the ﬁ rst 10 - min block ( AU pre ) of the Alternative Uses ( AU ) task , which consisted of producing unusual / original uses for conventional , everyday objects . In the NFT phase , participants performed three 8 - min NFT sessions , each followed by an AU block . The whole procedure , including a short post - training debrie ﬁ ng , took about 2 h . 2 . 3 . Neurofeedback apparatus and procedure EEG signals were recorded using a G . tec g . HIamp ampli ﬁ er ( Guger Technologies OG , Austria ) with 34 scalp sensors mounted on an elastic cap ( EASYCAP GmbH , Germany ) according to the 10 / 20 system : Fpz , AFz , Fz , FCz , Cz , CPz , Pz , POz , Oz , Fp1 , F3 , FC3 , C3 , CP3 , P3 , O1 , F7 , FT7 , T7 , TP7 , P7 , Fp2 , F4 , FC4 , C4 , CP2 , CP4 , CP6 , P4 , O2 , F8 , FT8 , T8 , TP8 . AFz and the right cheek were used as reference and ground , re - spectively . The neurofeedback procedure ( including baseline recording , online EEG data analysis , visual feedback presentation and data storing ) was controlled by custom software developed in Simulink and Matlab ( R2015a , MathWorks Inc . , USA ) . EEG signals were sampled at 512 Hz and band - pass ﬁ ltered ( 0 . 1 – 60 Hz ) . An additional 50 Hz notch ﬁ lter was also applied . The electrodes CP2 , CP4 , CP6 and P4 were chosen as representative of the EEG oscillation level over the right parietal region ( see , for instance , Koessler et al . , 2009 ) . In fact , previous EEG studies have speci ﬁ cally implicated right - lateralized parietal activity in AU tasks ( Fink and Benedek , 2014 ; Benedek et al . , 2011 , 2014 ; Fink et al . , 2007 ) , and fMRI studies have pointed to the right inferior parietal lobe as a key com - ponent of a fronto - parietal network involved in divergent thinking ( Aberg et al . , 2016 ; Beaty et al . , 2014 ; Fink et al . , 2010 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) . The signal averaged over these four electrodes was analyzed online and visual feedback was provided to participants if the power in the frequency band of interest ( i . e . , the alpha or beta band ) exceeded the mean power measured in the baseline EO block by 30 % ( normal - ization ) . The low and high cut - o ﬀ frequencies of a band - pass ﬁ lter ( Butterworth ﬁ lter ) were set speci ﬁ cally for each NFT protocol , such that the 8 – 12 Hz and 16 – 24 Hz ranges were passed in the alpha and the beta NFT protocols , respectively . The signal was then squared , and band - speci ﬁ c frequency power was measured online in a 250 - ms sliding window and compared to the alpha / beta power averaged over the entire 3 - min EO baseline period . If the power was 30 % greater than the mean baseline power ( threshold ) , then feedback was delivered . The visual feedback consisted of a video stream characterized by a dynamic sequence of di ﬀ erent pictures of natural scenarios . The pic - tures were selected from a set of public - domain pictures available on the Internet ( depicting people in daily contexts and landscapes ) , and connected in a video sequence through a zoom e ﬀ ect . Participants were told that they should make the video advance , although no explicit instructions were given by the experimenter on how to achieve control over EEG activity . Participants were told to immerse themselves in the video and try to imagine which scenario would come up . If the EEG power level was under the selected threshold , participants saw a static frame of the video stream ; otherwise , the video stream went forward . The visual feedback was presented on a 19 ″ LCD monitor with 800 × 600 pixel - resolution and a 60 Hz refresh rate . To evaluate whether NFT e ﬀ ectively modulated brain oscillations in the alpha / beta band , and whether this modulation had an e ﬀ ect on behavioral performance , a sham neurofeedback procedure was ad - ministered to a control group . In the sham condition , participants were tested with the same experimental procedure as in the training condi - tion . Crucially , control participants were prepared for the EEG re - cording and received the same instructions to take control over the video stream . However , in the sham condition , the visual feedback was totally unrelated to participants ’ brain activity ( Hosseini et al . , 2016 ; Ros et al . , 2013 ; Egner et al . , 2002 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , each sham participant was exposed to the video stream obtained from a corresponding training participant ( i . e . , from the alpha training group for alpha sham and from the beta training group for beta sham ) . The presentation order of video stream experiences obtained from the training group was pseudorandomized . 2 . 4 . Creative performance : Alternative Uses ( AU ) task All participants performed four blocks of the Alternative Uses ( AU ) task ( see Fig . 1 ) , in which they were instructed to think of and write down alternative uses for common objects ( e . g . , a brick , a knife ) . We administered the paper - and - pencil version of the task . The ﬁ rst block was completed in the pre - training phase , and the other three in the NFT phase , each after a neurofeedback session . Each AU block consisted of 5 objects ; participants were required to produce as many alternative uses as they could think of for each object in 2 min , for a total of 10 min per block . A total of 20 objects ( ﬁ ve per session ) were randomly presented to the participants . Two measures of participants ’ creative performance were derived from the AU task : originality and ﬂ uency . Participants generated a total of 3180 uses in the alpha NFT protocol , and a total of 3728 uses in the beta NFT protocol for the 20 objects presented across the four sessions . Two judges independently rated the originality of each response sepa - rately for the alpha and beta NFT protocols ( Silvia et al . , 2008 ) . For each object , the responses were transcribed onto a spreadsheet and alphabetically ordered . This method ensured that the ratings were not biased by the serial position of the response , the total number of re - sponses in the set , and the preceding and subsequent responses . The judges were required to read all responses before scoring them . Re - sponse originality was rated on a 1 ( not at all original ) to 5 ( highly original ) scale , using the scoring procedure of Silvia et al . ( 2008 ) . This scoring procedure was originally proposed by Wilson et al . ( 1953 ) , to assess individual di ﬀ erences in originality . According to their model , responses must be uncommon , remote , and clever to be judged as creative . Judges were asked to include these three criteria into their evaluation with the understanding that a strength on one criterion could balance a weakness on another criterion ( Silvia et al . , 2008 ) . Inter - rater reliability calculated on the total number of uses was good in Fig . 1 . Schematic structure of the experimental protocol . The protocol started with a 3 - min EEG recording with eyes closed ( EC ) , a 3 - min baseline EEG recording with eyes open ( EO ) and the ﬁ rst 10 - min block of the Alternative Uses task ( AU pre ) . The NFT consisted of three 8 - min neurofeedback sessions ( NFT 1 , NFT 2 , and NFT 3 ) , each followed by a 10 - min block of the Alternative Uses task ( AU 1 , AU 2 , and AU 3 ) . S . Agnoli et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 99 – 106 101 both the alpha - ( Cohen ' s κ = 0 . 61 ) and beta - neurofeedback protocols ( Cohen ' s κ = 0 . 65 ) . In case of large discrepancies between ratings , the judges were asked to review their responses and to assign a score by consensus . Mean originality scores were ﬁ nally derived from the ratings of the two judges . In order to measure the change in participants ’ creative potential as a consequence of the experimental session , three delta scores were computed . Namely , separately for each dependent variable ( originality and ﬂ uency ) , the average score obtained during the ﬁ rst AU block ( AU pre ) was subtracted from the scores obtained during each of the other three AU sessions ( i . e . , AU 1 , AU 2 , and AU 3 ) . 2 . 5 . Creative Activity and Accomplishment Checklist ( CAAC ) CAAC is a self - report measure of creative achievement in di ﬀ erent life domains . It was delivered while the neurofeedback apparatus was being prepared . It was ﬁ rst used by Hocevar ( 1981 ) and , since then , it has been frequently used in creativity research ( e . g . , Milgram and Hong , 1999 ; Runco et al . , 1990 ; Paek et al . , 2016 ) and included in the Runco Creativity Assessment Battery ( rCAB ) . The original version of the scale measures creative accomplishments in many domains . The present study used a short 45 - item version of the instrument referring to the artistic , scienti ﬁ c , and everyday creative domains . Each item represents an activity performed in one of these three domains . The checklist uses a four - point ordinal response scale . Participants are asked to answer each item using the following scale : A = Never did this , B = Did this once or twice , C = Did this 3 – 5 times , or D = Did this more than 5 times . To account for the in ﬂ uence of context on creative activities , each item also asks how many times they performed an activity both within and outside their scholastic environment , with reference to their entire education . For each item , participants had to check two re - sponses ( A - D ) that best described the frequency of the activity per - formed , respectively , inside school and outside school . Finally , a total creative achievement score for each participant was derived from the average of the artistic , scienti ﬁ c , and everyday creative achievement scores inside and outside of school . 2 . 6 . Data analysis As suggested by past literature ( Angelakis et al . , 2007 ; Dempster and Vernon , 2009 ) , neurofeedback e ﬃ cacy was evaluated by extracting the percentage of time ( time % ) frequency power in the trained bands ( i . e . , 8 – 12 Hz and 16 – 24 Hz frequency bands for the alpha and beta NFT protocols , respectively ) was above the threshold in the targeted area . Speci ﬁ cally , average signals from the four electrodes considered for the NFT ( i . e . , CP2 , CP4 , CP6 , and P4 ) were band - pass ﬁ ltered ( Hamming windowed Sinc FIR ﬁ lter ) and squared ( power , in μ V 2 ) to isolate the rhythmic activity of interest . An 8 – 12 Hz band - pass ﬁ lter was applied on EEG data recorded during the alpha NFT protocol , whereas a 16 – 24 Hz band - pass ﬁ lter was applied in the beta NFT protocol . The percentage of time above threshold was measured by comparing , for each time point in a recording block ( i . e . , EO , NFT 1 , NFT 2 , and NFT 3 ) , the mean power in the NFT - speci ﬁ c band in the preceding 250 - ms in - terval with the mean power in the EO block : time % was computed as the percentage of time points in the block that exceeded the power ( in the respective band ) averaged over the baseline EO block by 30 % . To note that this procedure totally re ﬂ ects the procedure used online during NFT to deliver feedback . Even if no real feedback was delivered in the sham condition , the percentage of time participants spent above the threshold was computed o ﬄ ine both for training and sham condi - tions , considering the corresponding frequency band of interest . In other words , time % for the alpha NFT and the alpha sham groups ac - counted for the time in which alpha power was above threshold , whereas time % for the beta NFT and the beta sham groups accounted for the time in which beta power was above threshold . EEGlab ( v12 . 0 . 2 . 6b ; Delorme and Makeig , 2004 ) functions were used for EEG data preprocessing . A repeated - measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was conducted with SESSION ( 4 levels : EO , NFT 1 , NFT 2 , NFT 3 ) as a within - subjects factor , and CONDITION ( 2 levels : Training , Sham ) and PROTOCOL ( 2 levels : Alpha , Beta ) as between - subjects variables . Finally , in order to investigate the e ﬀ ect of the alpha neurofeedback protocol on creative potential , changes in originality and ﬂ uency ( measured by subtracting the baseline average score , AU pre , from the average scores in AU 1 , AU 2 , and AU 3 ) were explored in two separate generalized linear mixed models ( AR1 covariance structure ) and treated as repeated dependent variables . Robust error estimation was used to control for the e ﬀ ect of outliers ( Wu , 2009 ) . SESSION ( 3 levels : NFT 1 , NFT 2 , NFT 3 ) was entered in the models as a within - subjects factor , while CONDITION ( 2 levels : Training , Sham ) and CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENT ( 2 levels : Low , High ) were entered as between - subjects factors . Finally , two - way and three - way interactions between the pre - vious variables were added to the models . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . EEG data : neurofeedback e ﬃ cacy The analysis showed signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ects of SESSION ( F 3 , 288 = 4 . 847 , p = . 003 , η p2 = . 060 ) and CONDITION ( F 1 , 76 = 8 . 081 , p = . 006 , η p2 = . 096 ) , and a signi ﬁ cant SESSION x CONDITION inter - action ( F 3 , 288 = 3 . 086 , p = . 028 , η p2 = . 039 ) , highlighting a constant increase in the percentage of time participants spent above the threshold in the Training condition , as compared to the Sham condi - tion , for both alpha and beta NFT protocols . Fig . 2 depicts the mean time % values ( ± SE ) separately for the di ﬀ erent protocols ( Alpha and Beta ) and conditions ( Training and Sham ) . 3 . 2 . Behavioral data 3 . 2 . 1 . Alpha protocol A signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ect of CONDITION emerged on ﬂ uency ( F 1 , 108 = 11 . 46 , p = . 001 , 95 % CI = [ − 10 . 282 , − 1 . 536 ] ) , highlighting an overall di ﬀ erence in ﬂ uency scores between the Training and the Sham conditions , with a decrease in ﬂ uency in the former and a slight in - crease in the latter ( Fig . 3 ) . No other main or interactions e ﬀ ects on ﬂ uency were signi ﬁ cant ( all p s > . 114 ) . Furthermore , no signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ects emerged on originality scores ( all p s > . 205 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 . Beta protocol The same statistical approach as in the alpha neurofeedback pro - tocol was used to explore the change in creative potential as a con - sequence of the beta protocol . First , the analysis performed on ﬂ uency Fig . 2 . Mean percentage of time above threshold . Time [ % ] was computed separately for the two protocols ( Alpha and Beta ) as a function of SESSION ( EO , NFT 1 , NFT 2 , and NFT 3 ) , and CONDITION ( Training and Sham ) . Error bars represent standard errors of the mean ( SEM ) . S . Agnoli et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 99 – 106 102 scores showed a signi ﬁ cant SESSION X CONDITION X CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENT interaction ( F 2 , 108 = 5 . 74 , p = . 004 ) . No other inter - actions or main e ﬀ ects were signi ﬁ cant . In order to further explore the three - way interaction , separate analyses for the two creative achieve - ment levels were performed . These analyses showed a signi ﬁ cant in - teraction between SESSION and CONDITION only in low creative achievers ( F 2 , 54 = 3 . 78 , p = . 029 for low creative achievers , F 2 , 54 = 2 . 09 , p = . 134 for high creative achievers ) . In particular , as shown in Fig . 4 ( upper left panel ) , the Training and Sham conditions were characterized by two di ﬀ erent trends in low creative achievers : in comparison to the Sham condition ( which was the reference point for the comparison ) , an increase in ﬂ uency was found in the Training condition , which was signi ﬁ cant between the ﬁ rst and the third sessions ( AU 1 vs . AU 3 , b = 6 . 15 , t 54 = 2 . 65 , p = . 010 , 95 % CI = [ 1 . 506 , 10 . 797 ] ) , and almost signi ﬁ cant between the second and the third sessions ( AU 2 vs . AU 3 , b = 5 . 17 , t 54 = 1 . 99 , p = . 051 , 95 % CI = [ − 0 . 019 , 10 . 362 ] ) , while there was no signi ﬁ cant change in ﬂ uency between the ﬁ rst and the second sessions ( AU 1 vs . AU 2 , b = 0 . 98 , t 54 = 0 . 41 , p = . 686 , 95 % CI = [ − 3 . 856 , 5 . 816 ] ) . Similarly to the analysis of ﬂ uency , the analysis performed on ori - ginality scores showed a signi ﬁ cant SESSION X CONDITION X CREA - TIVE ACHIEVEMENT interaction ( F 2 , 108 = 4 . 66 , p = . 011 ) . No other main e ﬀ ects or interactions were signi ﬁ cant . In order to further explore the three - way interaction , separate analyses for the two creative achievement levels were performed . These analyses showed a sig - ni ﬁ cant interaction between SESSION and CONDITION only at a low creative achievement level ( F 2 , 54 = 3 . 39 , p = . 041 for low creative achievers ; F 2 , 54 = 1 . 75 , p = . 184 for high creative achievers ) . As shown in Fig . 4 ( bottom left panel ) , low creative achievers in the Sham con - dition were characterized by originality scores which were slightly , even if not signi ﬁ cantly , below the baseline level ; instead , in the Training condition originality emerged above the baseline level and higher than in the Sham condition , particularly in the ﬁ rst block ( AU 1training vs . AU 1sham , b = − 0 . 31 , t 54 = 2 . 38 , p = . 021 , 95 % CI = [ 0 . 049 , 0 . 568 ] ) . 4 . Discussion The present study describes a rapid NFT procedure expressly de - signed to increase speci ﬁ c brain activities that were previously shown to be associated with creative thinking . In particular , two NFT protocols were tested , with the aim of increasing alpha or beta power over the right parietal region in a single day . The purpose of these procedures was to enhance participants ’ creative potential , as measured through ideational ﬂ uency and originality in a divergent thinking task . This way , we also tested the functional role of alpha and beta activity on divergent thinking . Fig . 3 .

Error bars represent SEM . S . Agnoli et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 99 – 106 103 First , we demonstrated the e ﬀ ectiveness of the NFT procedure in increasing both alpha and beta activity in the right parietal region . Its e ﬀ ectiveness was shown by a progressive increase in the amount of time in which alpha and beta activity exceeded the mean oscillatory power recorded in the baseline period . Crucially , this e ﬀ ect emerged over three sessions of NFT in the training group , whereas no increase in the amount of time spent above the threshold emerged in the sham control group . Previous studies on neurofeedback often used control conditions in which participants simply sat and relaxed without NFT ( for a dis - cussion see Van Boxtel et al . , 2012 ) . In the current study , however , we used a more suitable control condition in which participants received the same instructions and visual stimulation as the training group did , except that the video stream was not linked to their brain activity ( Hosseini et al . , 2016 ; Ros et al . , 2013 ; Egner et al . , 2002 ) . This strategy allowed us to assess the neurophysiological and behavioral e ﬀ ects of NFT , while removing confounding factors such as di ﬀ erences in the instructions , participants ’ expectations of training e ﬃ cacy , and sti - mulus perception . Our result highlights , for the ﬁ rst time , the e ﬀ ec - tiveness of a NFT procedure speci ﬁ cally designed to modulate brain activity that is directly associated with creative behavior , in terms of divergent thinking abilities . In particular , our results support the hy - pothesis that participants could be trained to enhance their brain os - cillations , in order to maintain high alpha and beta power for increasing amounts of time over the training sessions . Whereas it has been pre - viously demonstrated that learning how to self - regulate a general state of relaxation increases creative performance ( Gruzelier , 2014a ) , our procedure allowed participants to engage speci ﬁ c brain activities which have been demonstrated to be directly associated with creative cogni - tion . In doing so , our study highlights the functional relevance of such brain activity . We also explored the e ﬀ ects of alpha and beta NFT over the parietal region on AU performance . Surprisingly , the alpha NTF protocol did not yield any signi ﬁ cant enhancement in participants ’ originality scores . The increase in alpha was instead associated with a decrease in idea - tional ﬂ uency in the training group , compared to the sham group . Contrary to our initial hypothesis , an enhancement of alpha oscillation power over the right parietal region was detrimental to AU perfor - mance . In other words , although the NFT procedure was designed on the basis of recent research showing a robust relation between alpha oscillations and creative performance ( see Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) , and it was indeed e ﬀ ective at enhancing alpha oscillations , it had no consistent incremental e ﬀ ect on the ﬂ uency dimension of divergent thinking performance . However , some considerations should be made when interpreting this surprising result . Firstly , most of the past re - search has focused on the originality dimension of creative behavior ( Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 for a review ) and has shown di ﬀ erences in originality between individuals with high and low levels of creativity , but no di ﬀ erences in ideational ﬂ uency ( Fink et al . , 2009a ) . In this vein , an alpha power increase in the right parietal region has been associated with the qualitative aspects of divergent thinking ( i . e . , originality ) ra - ther than a mere di ﬀ erence in the number of responses ( i . e . , ﬂ uency ; Fink et al . , 2009b ) . On the other hand , it is possible that our alpha NTF protocol , by increasing alpha oscillations , might have induced relaxa - tion in our participants , which in turn could have been detrimental to ﬂ uency . It should be also noted that common experimental paradigms re - quire participants to think of and report the single most original idea , and are speci ﬁ cally designed to separate the generative phase from the oral or written report of the idea . This procedure allows researchers to investigate EEG oscillations speci ﬁ cally during the ideational phase of divergent thinking tasks . Idea generation requires a shift from ex - ternally - directed attention to internally - directed attention . During this phase , an increase in alpha power is detected , especially in the right parietal region . Such an increase might re ﬂ ect a shielding mechanism supporting internally - directed attention , which would prevent the in - terference of irrelevant external stimuli and facilitate the ( re ) combination of remotely associated semantic information ( e . g . , Agnoli et al . , 2015 ; Benedek et al . , 2011 ; Fink et al . , 2007 , 2009a ; Benedek et al . , 2014 , 2016 ) . Unlike past EEG research , we analyzed the impact of previously trained brain activity on subsequent creative performance on a paper - and - pencil task . Thus , we could argue that the alpha power increase in the parietal region might be bene ﬁ cial in a pure ideational phase , but its bene ﬁ cial role might be interrupted or disturbed during our task . Indeed , participants in the current study performed a paper - and - pencil AU task that not only required to generate original and al - ternative ideas , but also to transcribe all ( or some ) of them , alternating an ideational phase characterized by internally - focused attention with an encoding phase characterized by externally - focused attention . We could assume that our paper - and - pencil task could have a ﬀ ected the bene ﬁ cial shielding e ﬀ ect associated to the enhancement of alpha power in the parietal brain region , as it required a continuous shift between internal and external allocation of attention . Further studies are needed to investigate the relation between an increase in alpha power and the production of original ideas in paper - and - pencil di - vergent thinking tasks . At the same time , it is important to understand not only the duration of the training e ﬀ ect on subsequent creative performance , but also any possible interference of complex divergent thinking tasks on the trained brain activity . Moreover , while we con - sidered the entire range of alpha oscillations ( 8 – 12 Hz ) , future NFT studies could target upper ( 10 – 12 Hz ) vs . lower ( 8 – 10 Hz ) bands of alpha oscillations , as the former appears more associated with creative performance ( Fink and Benedek , 2014 ; Fink et al . , 2009b , 2011 ) . Strikingly , our study showed bene ﬁ cial e ﬀ ects of the beta neuro - feedback protocol on divergent thinking performance , thus suggesting a key functional role of beta oscillations in creativity . In particular , beta NFT showed a consistent behavioral e ﬀ ect in participants characterized by low creative achievement . Indeed , both originality and ﬂ uency in - creased during the three beta NFT sessions , but only in low creative achievers belonging to the training group . Consistent with past research ( e . g . , Jaeggi et al . , 2014 ; Rosen et al . , 2016 ) , this result once again highlights the importance of considering basic individual di ﬀ erences as moderating variables for training success ( see below ) . In addition , even though originality and ﬂ uency are usually highly related ( Runco , 2010 ) , the intrinsic di ﬀ erences in these creative indexes should be highlighted . While originality was measured through the ratings of expert judges , ﬂ uency was a truly quantitative measure calculated from the total number of responses produced by participants . Our results showed that the beta NFT protocol a ﬀ ected both measures . Speci ﬁ cally , low creative achievers in the training group exhibited a progressive increase in ideational ﬂ uency during the training sessions , whereas originality was characterized by a signi ﬁ cant initial increase , followed by a return to baseline values . Overall , these results suggest that ﬂ uency seemed to bene ﬁ t from repetition of the training sessions , whereas originality did not . The qualitative aspect of divergent thinking indeed seemed less in ﬂ uenced by NFT repetition . This e ﬀ ect should , however , be taken with caution , as we used a small number of sessions during the training protocol . The limited number of training sessions might also explain the lack of e ﬀ ects in high creative achievers . Indeed , we cannot exclude the possibility that these participants would bene ﬁ t from longer NFT protocols , including several sessions over di ﬀ erent days ( Marzbani et al . , 2016 for a review ) . Taken together , these results showed that rapid NFT training of beta activity over the right parietal region produced a signi ﬁ cant increase in creative performance , whereas the rapid alpha NFT protocol did not . In other words , our beta NFT protocol , more so than alpha NFT , appears speci ﬁ cally capable of boosting divergent thinking . As already de - monstrated by past research ( Mölle et al . , 1999 ) , a signi ﬁ cant increase of beta activity over the parietal region is associated with better per - formance in divergent thinking tasks , probably re ﬂ ecting an enhance - ment in attentiveness and in binding capacity ( Bhattacharya and Petsche , 2005 ; Razumnikova , 2007 ) , which are the main functions re - quired for divergent thinking . Extending previous ﬁ ndings , our study S . Agnoli et al . Neuropsychologia 118 ( 2018 ) 99 – 106 104 suggests that beta activity in the parietal region seems not only to favor thinking processes occurring during the recording of the brain activity , but also the performance in a following divergent thinking task , thus highlighting a key functional role of beta parietal oscillations in crea - tive performance . Moreover , we can assume that the bene ﬁ cial e ﬀ ects of the beta power increase over the parietal region may last over sub - sequent time intervals , as signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ects emerged over the 8 - min NFT training sessions used in the present study . Although our experi - mental procedure does not allow us to identify all the brain structures and functions modulated by NFT , our results demonstrate a role for right parietal activity in creative cognition . The posterior parietal cortex is a multimodal associative region involved in several higher - order functions such as multisensory integration , sensory - motor trans - formation , spatial coding and attention ( Kaas and Stepniewska , 2016 ; Whitlock , 2017 ) . In the context of creativity , neuroimaging studies have shown that the inferior parietal lobule is implicated in creative pro - duction as part of the default - mode network ( DMN ; Beaty et al . , 2015 , 2016 ) . For instance , more creative individuals ( as evaluated by a di - vergent thinking task ) showed increased resting - state functional con - nectivity between the inferior parietal lobule and other nodes of the DMN ( Beaty et al . , 2014 ) and this network seems to cooperate with areas of the executive system ( such as the ventral anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) during the AU task ( Beaty et al . , 2015 ; Mayseless et al . , 2015 ) . Our study adds to the imaging evidence by suggesting that neural activity within the parietal node of the DMN is functionally relevant to AU performance . Interestingly , functional connectivity studies have also shown that highly creative individuals are characterized by greater cooperation between the DMN and executive control areas at rest ( Beaty et al . , 2014 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ; Wei , 2014 ) . This suggests that highly creative individuals already have an e ﬃ cient and optimized system that enables them to outperform others on creative tasks such as the AU task . Thus , while the lack of improvement in our high creative achie - vers may be due to a ceiling e ﬀ ect and / or the relatively short duration of our NFT procedure , our data suggest that this procedure is particu - larly bene ﬁ cial in individuals with less e ﬃ cient systems . This result is consistent with prior research on NFT and other causal methods ( i . e . , brain stimulation ) showing the moderating in ﬂ uence of individual di ﬀ erences on brain physiology , personality or the ability to perform the task ( Rosenfeld et al . , 1997 ; Hardman et al . , 1997 ; Gruzelier , 2014c ; Rosen et al . , 2016 ; Paracampo et al . , 2018 ; Valchev et al . , 2017 ) . Although the e ﬀ ectiveness of the proposed NFT procedure on creative behavior deserves more investigation , understanding the im - pact of a short training procedure on real - world creativity is a parti - cularly pertinent topic , which may have practical bene ﬁ ts in our daily lives . In this light , the present study is a ﬁ rst attempt demonstrating that training self - control over brain activities speci ﬁ cally related to creative thinking is e ﬀ ective in producing a signi ﬁ cant enhancement of the individual creative potential .
