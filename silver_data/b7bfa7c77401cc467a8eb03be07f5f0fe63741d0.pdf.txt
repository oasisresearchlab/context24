Abstract Cholera is a diarrheal disease caused by a protein toxin released by Vibrio cholera in the host’s intestine . The toxin enters intestinal epithelial cells after binding to specific carbohydrates on the cell surface . Over recent years , considerable effort has been invested in developing inhibitors of toxin adhesion that mimic the carbohydrate ligand , with particular emphasis on exploiting the multiva - lency of the toxin to enhance activity . In this review we introduce the structural features of the toxin that have guided the design of diverse inhibitors and summarise recent developments in the field . 484 Introduction Cholera , meaning a flow of bile , is caused by an acute enteric infection of the Gram - negative facultative anaerobe Vibrio cholerae . Not only does this disease have a disastrous effect on health , it also impacts on the socioeconomic status of societies where it is endemic . The V . cholerae bacterium was identified by Robert Koch in 1883 , and ever since then , this scourge has grown continuously with catastrophic effects on millions of people [ 1 ] . Although appropriate water , hygiene and sanitation interventions can reduce incidence of bacterial infection , the WHO predicts that there will still continue to be millions of deaths due to diarrhoea in the developing nations of the world . While cholera is rare and seldom life threatening in developed countries , it can still pose a risk to those at the extremes of age and the immunosuppressed . However , Hispaniola Island and western African countries ( Ghana , Guinea , Guinea - Bissau , Niger and Sierra Leone ) are completely under the control of this epidemic . According to annual statistics of 2016 in the Weekly Epidemiological Record ( WER ) by the WHO , 172454 cases are reported in 42 endemic countries including 1304 deaths . Among 42 countries , Afghanistan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , Haiti , Kenya , and the United Republic of Tanzania were majorly affected [ 2 ] . Recent data for the year 2017 from the GIDEON internet site ( that continuously scans Medline , WHO , CDC and other peer reviewed journals ) , high - lights the recent cholera outbreak principally affecting Somalia , DRC and Tanzania [ 3 ] . The total number of cases reported in these countries was almost 65 , 000 leading to 1500 deaths so far . In the Americas , the Haiti region has been fighting this Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 485 epidemic since October 2010 . As of June 2017 , the outbreak was still ongoing and a total of over 800 , 000 cases , including 10 , 000 deaths , had been registered [ 3 ] . This infection also prevails in the Dominican Republic and Cuba [ 2 ] . Furthermore , deaths due to cholera in Asian countries constitute 3 % of the world’s total [ 2 ] . However , this may be underestimated as limi - tations in surveillance systems in large parts of Asia , lead to millions of cholera cases not being recorded . After broad analy - sis , Ali et al . estimated that 2 . 9 million cases and 95 , 000 deaths happen every year worldwide [ 4 ] . Thus cholera continues to be a serious concern in many parts of the globe . The agent responsible for causing diarrhea is an AB 5 toxin re - leased by the bacteria . Thus , an understanding of this toxin becomes essential in finding / developing molecules that could prevent cell entry of the toxin and inhibit its activity . AB 5 toxins are an important class of bacterial toxins . They consist of a single A - subunit and a pentamer of B - subunits [ 5 ] . The cata - lytic activity of the toxins is due to the A - subunit , while the B - subunit enables binding of the complex to the cell surface and its delivery into the target cells , hence the complete AB 5 holo - toxin is required for their toxic effects . Because of the differ - ence in the sequence homology and catalytic activity , the classes of AB 5 toxins are subdivided into three families ( Figure 3 ) : the cholera toxin ( CT ) family , the shiga toxin ( ST ) family and the pertussis toxin ( PT ) family [ 6 ] . The CT family contains CT , and heat - labile toxins LT - I and LT - II [ 7 , 8 ] . The ST family contains the shiga toxins ( SHT ) themselves and the related verotoxins ( also known as shiga - like toxins : SLT - I , SLT - II ) [ 9 , 10 ] and SHT toxin comes from Shigella dysenteriae and verotoxin comes from enteropathogenic E . coli strains such as O157 - H7 . SHT and SLT - I are almost identical , with very little difference in the A - subunit . But the SLT - II shows more deviation in its gene sequence from the SHT and SLT - I toxins [ 9 ] . Sequence homology in the CT family is high between CTB and LTI - B ( 80 % identical ) , but much lower between these pro - teins and the LTIIa and LTIIB toxins . PT is quite unusual in that all five of its B - subunits are different , but overall , an AB 5 architecture is still preserved [ 11 ] . A detailed knowledge of the 3D structure of these toxins is informative for the design of effective inhibitors . Review Structure and function of cholera toxin Many crystallographic studies of the AB 5 toxins have been undertaken over the past 20 years [ 8 - 14 ] . Here , we focus solely on those describing the structure of the cholera toxin . A - Subunit The A - subunit of CT is the catalytic site of the AB 5 toxin , and forms a complex with the B - pentamer [ 15 ] . It is initially expressed as a single polypeptide chain which is cleaved by a protease to give two subunits , A1 and A2 , remain held together by extensive non - covalent forces and a single interchain disul - fide bond [ 16 ] . The A2 - subunit acts as a linker between the toxic A1 - subunit and CTB which is the delivery vehicle that can transport the complex into cells and direct the toxin to the endo - plasmic reticulum , from where it can escape into the cytosol . The A1 chain has ADP - ribosyltransferase activity that allows the toxin to covalently modify the α - subunit of the stimulatory G protein G s α so that it remains in its active GTP - bound state . The consequence of this change is to produce high levels of cAMP which activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator which is a chloride ion channel [ 15 ] . Transport of chloride ions to the intestine is accompanied by excessive amounts of water entering the gut and the diarrhea that is symptomatic of cholera . The A1 - subunit consists of three domains namely A1 1 , A1 2 and A1 3 ( Figure 1 ) . While the A1 1 domain is responsible for cataly - sis , the A1 2 and A1 3 domains have been implicated in allowing the A1 subunit to escape from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) into the cytosol . Following arrival in the ER , protein disulfide bond isomerase can reduce the disulfide bond between A1 3 and A2 , releasing the A1 protein and causing the A1 2 and A1 3 domains to unfold [ 17 ] . The protein is then recognised by the cell as a misfolded protein and is exported into the cytolsol for degradation . However , once in the cytosol , it binds to another protein Arf6 , which stabilizes the A1 2 / A1 3 domains and acti - vates the A1 enzyme .

B - Subunit The B - subunit ( CTB ) is a homopentamer [ 18 , 19 ] , and crystallo - graphic data on B subunits of the CT family showed very little deviation ( less than 0 . 5 r . m . s . ) from exact rotational symmetry . Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 486 Five long α - helices surround the central cylindrical pore through which the A2 - subunit is threaded . Each subunit of a B - pentamer has a single binding site for the GM 1 oligosaccha - ride on the face of the pentamer distal to the A1 - subunit [ 12 , 14 ] . GM 1 is a branched pentasaccharide [ Gal β 1 - 3GalNAc β 1 - 4 ( NeuAc α 2 - 3 ) Gal β 1 - Glc β 1 - 1 - ceramide ] bearing a ceramide moiety at the anomeric center of the Glc moiety ( Figure 2 ) . The terminal galactose residue of GM 1 is buried most deeply inside the cavity of CTB [ 12 , 14 ] , while the sialic acid branch sits in a wider shallow pocket . Both of these termi - nal sugar residues show hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein and associated water molecules . The GM 1 oligosaccha - ride ( GM 1 os ) binds very tightly to CTB with a dissociation con - stant ( K d ) of around 40 nM ( measured by isothermal titration calorimetry , ITC ) , while simple galactosides have millimolar K d s and little interaction can be detected for simple sialosides [ 20 ] . The distance separating the binding sites is similar for all members of the AB 5 toxin family and is believed to be instru - mental in clustering the glycolipid ligands in such a way that membrane curvature is induced upon binding [ 21 ] . More recently , a second binding site has been discovered on the edge of the B - subunit sitting closer to the A - subunit face ( Figure 2 ) [ 13 , 22 - 25 ] , This secondary binding site recognises fucosylated structures including blood group oligosaccharides of the Lewis - y family . Individually , the interactions are much weaker than the CTB - GM 1 os interaction ( K d ca . 1 mM measured by ITC ) , but even these weak binding interactions can still be functionally useful once the effect of multivalent binding enhancement has been taken into consideration . Indeed , ITC experiments have also shown the highest affinity site on the SLT - 1 B - subunit has a K d of only 1 mM [ 26 ] , yet the toxin achieves sub - nanomolar affinity at a cell membrane . The purpose of the CTB blood group oligosaccharide binding site remains a topic for debate , but it may be responsible for the re - ported blood group dependence of the severity of cholera [ 13 , 24 , 27 ] , or it could provide an independent route for cell entry through interactions with cell surface glycoproteins [ 28 ] . Structure - based design of inhibitors for cholera toxin The availability of crystal structures for cholera and E . coli heat - labile toxins has driven opportunities for the design of po - tent inhibitors for these toxins . While some interest has been shown in the possibility of inhibition of cholera toxin assembly and inhibition of the enzymatic activity , most effort has been invested in seeking inhibitors of the adhesion process [ 29 ] . Designing the inhibitors for the receptor - binding process is a very compelling strategy , because the inhibitors would fight the toxin in the intestinal tract of the human host . Therefore ligands Figure 2 : a ) Structure of the cholera toxin showing the location of its carbohydrate binding sites and the structures of the Lewis - y and Ganglioside GM 1 ligands ; A - subunit ( blue ) , B - subunit ( red ) and the A2 peptide linker ( green ) . b ) Bottom face of the toxin showing the symmetry of the B - subunit and the A2 peptide linker emerging through the central channel . c ) Close - up view of the two sugar binding sites .

In the past years , several strategies have been drawn for the receptor binding to AB 5 toxins ; while some target on the individual binding sites , others are intended at designing multi - valent ligands against the entire toxin B pentamer [ 6 , 30 , 31 ] . Monovalent receptor - binding inhibitors Bernardi and co - workers designed carbohydrate derivatives that mimic the natural CT receptor , ganglioside GM 1 [ 32 ] . They replaced the central 3 , 4 - disubstituted Gal unit of GM 1 with dicarboxy cyclohexanediol ( DCCHD , Figure 3 ) . DCCHD ex - hibits the same absolute and relative configuration of the natural galactose residue . Taking this into account , a pseudo - tetrasac - charide 1 was made in which the recognition units , the terminal galactose and Neu5Ac , were attached onto the DCCHD scaf - fold . Inhibition assays of the oligosaccharide mimetic with CT and LT showed similar potency as that of natural ligands [ 32 ] . Beilstein J . Org .

Figure 3 : Bernardi and co - workers’ designed oligosaccharide mimetics of GM 1 . But , the alpha - sialylation was the bottleneck step in the synthe - sis , so they designed second generation inhibitors by changing the synthetically challenging α - Neu5Ac with alpha - hydroxy acids 2 [ 33 , 34 ] . Using a combinatorial approach , a library of non - hydrolyzable , non O - glycosidic third generation inhibitors were synthesised using appropriate linkers . The CTB affinity of these inhibitors was measured using weak affinity chromatogra - phy and some molecules displayed enhancement of affinity over the individual epitome ‘Galactose’ [ 35 ] . One such compound 3 has found to co - crystallise with CTB in a way that the galac - tose and sialic acid groups bind to adjacent CTB pentamers in the crystal lattice , opening a possible route for the structure - based design of inhibitors that aggregate the toxin [ 36 ] . Hol , Verlinde and co - workers designed and synthesised a library of compounds utilizing a fragment of the toxin’s natural receptor . Both CTB and LTB have specific affinity for the ter - minal galactose part of GM 1 [ 37 - 39 ] . They screened a number of galactose derivatives with substitution at O1 and C2 and found that the most potent molecule in this library was m - nitro - phenyl α - D - galactoside ( 4 ) which was 100 times better than galactose for binding to CTB [ 38 , 39 ] . In another report , Mitchell et al . designed and synthesised twenty 3 , 5 - substituted phenylgalactosides , e . g . , 5 and when these compounds were tested on CT it was found that they have a six - fold higher affinity than m - nitrophenyl α - D - galactopyranoside ( Figure 4 ) [ 40 ] . Vrasidas et al . synthesised a simple lactose - 2 - aminothiazoline conjugate as a CT antagonist . Its affinity for CTB was deter - mined by monitoring the change in fluorescence of tryptophan - 88 , located in the GM 1 binding site , upon titration of the pro - tein with the inhibitor . Compound 6 showed excellent binding with a K d value of 23 µM [ 41 ] . Robina and co - workers synthe - sised non - hydrolyzable S - galactosides and non - carbohydrate Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 488 Figure 5 : Bivalent inhibitor designed and synthesised by Pickens et al . ligands based on polyhydroxyalkylfuronate moieties and measured their affinities by weak affinity chromatography ( WAC ) and also studied their interaction by saturation transfer difference NMR experiments [ 42 ] . Although , these compounds , 7 and 8 , did not display good inhibition , the non - glycosylated ligands offered new avenues for better CT ligand designs . Multivalent receptor - binding inhibitors The five - fold symmetry of AB 5 toxins provides a strong encouragement to think about multivalent inhibitor design from ( even weakly binding ) monovalent inhibitors [ 30 , 31 ] . Multiva - lent ligands have been long applied to a wide range of protein targets [ 43 - 45 ] . By having an inhibitor that may bind simulta - neously with multiple binding sites , the dissociation rate of the complex is effectively reduced . Even if any individual ligand group dissociates from the protein , then the others will continue to make contact between the protein and the inhibitor , thus maintaining a high effective concentration of the dissociated ligand group in the vicinity of the binding site and increasing the probability of rebinding occurring . The gain in inhibitory potency for the multivalent ligands can be in many orders of magnitude . Here we have divided multivalent ligands and inhib - itors of cholera toxin into three classes : sub - pentavalent inhibi - tors ; pentavalent inhibitors ; and inhibitors containing more than five ligands . Sub - pentavalent inhibitors Hol and Fan [ 46 ] designed and synthesised both spanning and non - spanning bivalent inhibitors . “Spanning” means the ligand has sufficient length of the linker to reach the two binding moieties of CT , whereas “non - spanning” means there is insuffi - cient linker length for intra - pentamer chelation , but the second galactosyl moiety could bind to another CT molecule . They found that non - spanning bivalent inhibitors 9 – 12 as shown in Figure 5 , show more binding affinity than the monovalent ones , which could also be derived from a statistical effect of a higher rebinding rate . Bernardi , Casnati and co - workers prepared a bivalent ligand 13 for CT by attaching two copies of GM 1 mimic compound 3 to a calixarene ( Figure 6 ) [ 47 ] . By measuring the affinity for CT by fluorescence titration , they found that the enhancement in affinity was 3800 - fold as compared to the GM 1 mimic , which is consistent with a chelating mechanism . Hughes and co - workers synthesised and evaluated bivalent 1 , 2 , 3 triazole - linked galactopyranosides 14 and 15 as shown in Figure 7 [ 48 ] . They used a piperazine core as central divalent core on to which the galactose units were attached via flexible linkers . They found that these compounds exhibit binding affinity one order higher than m - nitrophenyl galactopyranoside ( 4 ) [ 48 ] . In another recent report , low molecular weight poly ( N - acryloylmorpholine ) was used to link galactose residues to form a bivalent inhibitor , but the biological assay demonstrated only moderate inhibitory activity [ 49 ] . Liu et al . synthesised bivalent ligands 16 and 17 , for evaluation through biophysical tech - niques ( Figure 7 ) [ 50 ] . They found that the enhancement in affinity and potency was due to non - specific interactions be - tween the linker portion , nitrophenyl group and CT . The inter - actions increase as linker length increase . Hence , they con - cluded that the length , size and chemical nature of the ligand has a major effect on binding with the protein toxin . While the ganglioside GM 1 head group is the highest affinity natural ligand for CTB , galactose and lactose ( Figure 8 ) head groups have also been used for synthesising bivalent and Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 489 Figure 6 : Bivalent inhibitor designed and synthesized by Arosio et al . Figure 7 : Bivalent inhibitors designed and synthesised by Leaver and Liu . tetravalent multivalent inhibitors and showed substantial gains in binding affinity in comparison to the corresponding monova - lent ligands . Pieters and co - workers attached a lactose - derived monomeric ligand to the dendrimer 18 , and found that there was an affinity and potency gain from divalent and tetravalent mole - cules [ 51 ] . Even the galactose containing dendrimers 20 bind as strongly as that of GM 1 [ 52 ] . As an improved design of ligand for CT , the GM 1 mimic synthesised by Bernardi and co - workers was attached to the dendrimer synthesised by the Pieters group and hence compounds 19 and 21 were obtained [ 53 ] . The diva - lent compound 19a and tetravalent compound 19b exhibited IC 50 values of 13 and 0 . 5 µM , respectively . In another report , Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 490 Figure 8 : Bivalent and tetravalent inhibitor designed and synthesised by Pieters , and Bernardi et al . they reported that the divalent compound 21a and tetravalent compound 21b displayed 9 , 500 and 83 , 000 - fold enhanced po - tency , respectively , than monovalent GM 1 [ 54 , 55 ] . Fu et al . synthesised a tetravalent ligand containing highly hydrophilic spacer arms 22b , and found that this ligand demon - strated almost the same potency with an IC 50 value of 160 pM as that of 21b ( IC 50 = 190 pM ) [ 56 ] . To reduce the energy loss in the form of entropic penalty to be paid on binding , Kumar et al . synthesised noncyclic and cyclic neoglycopeptides and glycoamides for cholera toxin , e . g . , 23 – 26 ( Figure 9 ) [ 57 ] . They prepared divalent , trivalent , tetravalent , cyclic divalent , cyclic trivalent , cyclic tetravalent and cyclic pentavalent inhibitors with large cyclic core struc - tures . Pentavalent inhibitors The pentameric structure of CTB has proved to be an enticing invitation to many scientists to develop multivalent inhibitors that are also pentavalent . Fan , Hol and co - workers were first to design and synthesise pentavalent inhibitors 27 – 29 , for the LTB / CTB [ 58 ] ( although Bundle and co - workers were also working on analogous designs for shiga - like toxin [ 59 ] ) . They Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 491 Figure 9 : Cyclic inhibitors synthesised by Kumar et al . for CT . synthesised the inhibitors on a pentacyclene core on which galactose and m - nitrophenyl - α - D - galactopyranoside were at - tached by long flexible linkers ( Figure 10 ) [ 60 , 61 ] . They found million - fold increases in activity in comparison to the corresponding monovalent inhibitors with IC 50 values of 40 nM . Zhang et al . synthesised large cyclic decapeptides ( up to 50 atoms in the ring ) in a “core - linker - finger” modular setup ( Figure 11 ) [ 62 ] . These compounds 30 showed good inhibitory results with IC 50 values 100 , 000 - fold more potent than monova - lent galactose . This strategy facilitated a methodical study to measure the effect of linker length on the affinity of the pentavalent ligands towards the target toxin . Large affinity - gains were achieved for pentavalent ligands with short linkers on these large cyclic cores , indicating that the central cyclic peptide core probably has an expanded ring conforma - tion . Garcia - Hartjes et al . synthesised and evaluated the GM 1 os linked calix [ 5 ] arene molecule 31 as shown in Figure 12 , and found that compound 31 displayed 100 , 000 times more potency as compared to GM1os derivatives having an IC 50 value of 450 pM [ 63 ] . In another report Siegel and co - workers showed that corannu - lene - based pentavalent glycocluster 32 ( Figure 13 ) bearing GM 1 os moieties possessed affinity for CT in low nanomolar range [ 64 ] . The IC 50 value obtained was in the range of 5 – 25 nM . Fu et al . also synthesised and evaluated a pentavalent inhibitor 33 ( Figure 14 ) , analogous to their tetravalent compound 22b to investigate the difference between matching or mismatching the valency with that of the target CTB protein [ 56 ] . Previous biophysical studies had suggested that a mismatch in the valen - cies of ligand and receptor favoured an aggregation mechanism for inhibition [ 55 ] whereas matching the valency has previ - ously been assumed to lead to the formation of 1 : 1 complexes [ 59 - 64 ] . They found that the potency exhibited by compound 33 in the usual enzyme - linked lectin assay ( IC 50 = 260 ± 20 pM ) was slightly lower that for the tetravalent compound 22b ( IC 50 = 160 ± 40 pM ) [ 56 ] . Inhibition results described in this review are essentially all derived from very similar types of en - zyme - linked lectin assays ( ELLA ) in which the inhibitors are used to prevent CTB - linked horseradish peroxidase from binding to microtitre plates coated with the ganglioside GM 1 ligand . However , it is important to note that IC 50 values are always dependent on the experimental design and the potency of some compounds may be underestimated if the concentra - tion of the target protein is similar to or higher than the measured IC 50 value . Pieters and co - workers have recently re - ported a new type of inhibition assay based on cultured intestinal organoids [ 64 ] , which when treated with the CT holo - toxin swell up as fluid is transported across their epithelia . Toxin inhibition is quantified by measuring the reduction in organoid swelling . When inhibitors 22b and 33 were re - evalu - ated using this new assay , they were found to be even more active than previously measured in the ELLA ( IC 50 = 34 pM for 22b in organoid assay vs 160 pM in ELLA ; IC 50 = 15 pM for 33 in organoid assay vs 260 pM in ELLA ) . While enzyme - linked lectin assays will undoubtedly continue to be a popular method for easily evaluating and comparing different inhibitors , the intestinal organoid assay introduced by Pieters and co - workers is now the most sensitive and realistic in vitro assay available [ 65 ] .

Figure 11 : Differently sized cyclic decavalent peptide core designed by Zhang et al . Branson et al . took a different approach to scaffold design in which they made a non - binding mutant of the target CTB pro - tein [ 66 ] , oxidised the N - terminal threonine residue of each subunit to an aldehyde and then chemically attached GM 1 os ligands by oxime ligation ( Figure 15 ) . This neoglycoprotein was able to display the five copies of the carbohydrate ligand Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 493 Figure 12 : Calix [ 5 ] arene core - based pentavalent inhibitor designed by Garcia - Hartjes et al . Figure 13 : Corannulene core - based pentavalent inhibitor designed by Mattarella et al . with appropriate spacing’s to maximize interactions with the target protein . Dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracen - trifugation demonstrated that the glycoprotein formed a 1 : 1 complex with the target CTB protein and was highly effec - tive as an inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 104 pM . Multivalent inhibitors with more than five ligands While pentavalent inhibitors are seductive as they match the symmetry with the CTB protein , many researchers have sought to exceed the valency of five . In many cases this is largely for convenience of preparation of polymers bearing multiple pendant groups , or to achieve inhibitors that are sufficiently long to cross - link the binding sites in a protein . Also , if multiva - lent molecules have not been specifically designed to match the distance between the target binding sites , then sometimes larger multivalent compounds are better . For example , Pieters and co - workers used a tryptophan fluorescence quenching assay to show that octavalent lactose - based dendrimer 34 ( Figure 16 ) had a K d value of 33 µM as compared to monovalent lactose de - rivative having a K d value of 18 , 000 µM [ 51 ] . Hence , com - pound 34 displayed 545 fold more potency per lactose unit than monovalent lactose . In another report , they found that octava - lent galactose - derived dendrimer 36 displayed excellent CT inhibition with an IC 50 value of 12 µM and this was better than monovalent GM 1 os ( IC 50 = 19 µM ) [ 52 ] . From the collabora - tion work of Pieters and Bernardi , an ELISA assay confirmed Beilstein J . Org .

Figure 15 : Neoglycoprotein inhibitor based on a non - binding mutant of CTB . that compound 35 ( Figure 16 ) was the most potent compound having an IC 50 value less than 0 . 5 µM [ 53 ] . In another report , they reported that the octavalent GM 1 os dendrimer complex 37 ( Figure 16 ) displayed a 380 , 000 - fold enhanced potency relative to monovalent GM 1 [ 54 ] . Polymeric scaffolds have also been used extensively over many years [ 67 ] . Some recent highlights have included using polymer backbones to identify GM1 analogues that can give enhanced multivalent interactions [ 68 ] , evolving glycopolymers using exchangeable ligands [ 69 ] , and tuning the way the ligands are connected to the polymer backbone for maximum interaction [ 70 , 71 ] . For example , using a fragment - based approach , Tran et al . synthesised and evaluated a library of polymer - based hetero - bifunctional ligands and found that some compounds showed low nanomolar multivalent inhibition [ 68 ] . Alpha - galactoside 38 ( Figure 17 ) showed the highest activity when presented on the polymer scaffold with an IC 50 value of 0 . 005 µM . In contrast , the IC 50 value shown by a monomeric version of this heterobifunctional ligand 39 was in the millimolar range , simi - lar to the compound m - nitrophenyl galactopyranoside ( 4 ) . Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 495 Figure 16 : Octavalent inhibitor designed by Pieters , Bernardi and co - workers . Fulton and co - workers developed a dynamic combinatorial library of glycopolymers employing exchangeable galactosyl or mannosyl hydrazide functions in conjunction with pendant benzaldehyde groups on the polymer backbone to produce exchangeable hydrazones , e . g . , 40 ( Figure 18 ) [ 69 ] . They were able to show that in the presence of LTB , the E . coli homo - logue of CTB , the polymer self - optimised its binding affinity for the protein by increasing the proportion of galactosyl residues in the backbone . In the presence of low concentrations of a dihydrazide cross - linking agent , these polymers can also be used to make crosslinked films on surfaces coated with bacteri - al toxin lectins [ 72 ] . Gibson and co - workers made a series of polyacrylates bearing pentafluorophenyl active ester groups which could be subse - quently converted to polyacrylamides by reaction with amine linkers of varying lengths [ 71 ] . The attachment of galactosyl azides provided a series of glycopolymer inhibitors of CTB Beilstein J . Org . Chem . 2018 , 14 , 484 – 498 . 496 Figure 18 : Glycopolymers with exchangeable sugar ligands and variable length linkers .

They were able to demonstrate that longer linkers be - tween the carbohydrate and polymer backbone gave the best inhibition , probably because they were better able to reach into the binding pocket of the protein . Multivalent scaffold bearing many galactosyl ligands need not be restricted to organic polymers . Gold nanoparticles coated in galactosyl ligands have been shown to be effective multivalent ligands for cholera toxin [ 73 ] and E . coli heat - labile toxin [ 74 ] . In these cases the objective of the studies was not to invoke inhibition , but rather to exploit the colour changes induced upon crosslinking the gold nanoparticles with CTB or LTB as a strategy for detecting the bacterial toxins . Conclusion Cholera and related diseases caused by other bacterial toxins remain a substantial threat to society . This challenge , and a mo - lecular understanding of the basis of toxin action , has driven the development of diverse inhibitors over many years and this area of research continues to flourish with imaginative and novel strategies emerging for potential antiadhesive therapeutics . Further advances in our understanding of the structural biology of bacterial toxins , in particular the roles of secondary carbo - hydrate binding sites , will provide new directions for the future development of inhibitors , for example , fucosylated polymers [ 75 ] , or hybrid inhibitors that can target both the blood group and the GM1 binding pockets . While other emerging , and sophisticated strategies for the use of multivalent scaffolds for displaying ( dynamic ) libraries of low affinity ligands may accelerate the process of finding effective mimics of the GM1 glycolipid that are simpler in structure and easier to develop into practical therapeutics . Furthermore , the introduction of diverse biophysical methods for studying inhibition mecha - nisms and novel inhibition assays using intestinal organoids are now providing better quality data and understanding of the action of multivalent inhibitors . The continuous innovation across this field will undoubtedly lead to many more exciting developments for years to come . Beilstein J . Org .
