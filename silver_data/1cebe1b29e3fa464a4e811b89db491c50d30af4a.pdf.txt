Introduction Many cellular activities including motility , differentiation and division , depend on the ability of cells to become polarized , a process that generally requires assembly of a polarized actin cytoskeleton to target secretion , vesicular transport and growth . Understanding how this polarization is brought about is a key problem in cell biology . In the rod - shaped yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , polarity is expressed in the pattern of cell growth , which is restricted to the ends of the long axis of the cell . This controlled spatial organization depends on both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons . F - actin is required for polarized growth , whilst the microtubular cytoskeleton is required to accurately position the growth zones at the opposite ends of the cell . Actin is organized in cortical patches associated with the growing surfaces of the cell and interference with the actin cytoskeleton completely disrupts cell polarity , resulting in cells becoming round . In contrast , disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton results in mispositioning of the growth zones and leads to alterations in cell morphology ( Hagan , 1998 ; Sawin and Nurse , 1998 ) . During interphase , microtubules are organized in antiparallel bundles with the plus ends facing the tips of the cell where they deliver the polarity marker , Tea1 ( Drummond and Cross , 2000 ; Hagan , 1998 ; Mata and Nurse , 1997 ) . Cells lacking Tea1 still polarize growth but either fail to properly position the growth zones , which results in bending and branching of cells , or grow only from one end , leading to monopolar growth ( Mata and Nurse , 1997 ) . In wild - type cells the pattern of growth changes during the cell cycle . After cell division growth is monopolar , taking place exclusively at the ‘old’ end , which was present in the previous cell cycle . However once a minimal cell size requisite is met and DNA replication is completed , growth is activated at the opposite ‘new’ end that was generated at cytokinesis . This transition from monopolar to bipolar growth is known as new end take off or NETO ( Mitchison and Nurse , 1985 ) , and represents a major morphogenetic transition in the ﬁssion yeast cell cycle . We reasoned that understanding the mechanisms underlying NETO might reveal new links between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and illuminate their roles in the spatial organization of the cell . Hence , we looked for homologues of known regulators of actin dynamics that might link actin organization to new end localization . One such regulator is Sc - SLA2 , which is essential in budding yeast for the proper assembly and function of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and for the establishment of cell polarity ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Sc - SLA2 binds actin in vitro through its talin - like domain and partially colocalizes with cortical actin patches at the growing surface of the cell ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Loss of Sc - SLA2 activity results in complete delocalization of cortical actin patches ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) as well as defects in the internalization step of endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Homologues of Sc - SLA2 have already been identiﬁed in humans as huntingtin interacting proteins ( Hip1 and Hip1R ) , and it has been suggested that Sla2 - related 1843 The rod - shaped Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell grows in a polarized fashion from opposing ends . Correct positioning of the growth zones is directed by the polarity marker Tea1 located at the cell ends where actin patches accumulate and cell growth takes place . We show that the S . pombe homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SLA2 , a protein involved in cortical actin organization and endocytosis , provides a link between the polarity marker and the growth machinery . In wild - type ﬁssion yeast cells , this homologue End4 / Sla2 is enriched at cell ends during interphase and localizes to a medial ring at cell division , mirroring the actin localization pattern throughout the cell cycle . Proper localization relies on membrane trafficking and is independent of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons . End4 / Sla2 is required for the establishment of new polarised growth zones , and deletion of its C - terminal talin - like domain prevents the establishment of a new growth zone after cell ﬁssion . We propose that End4 / Sla2 acts downstream of the polarity marker Tea1 and is implicated in the recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton to bring about polarised cell growth .

By interfering with membrane - actin cytoskeleton interactions ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ) , the loss of the huntingtin - Hip1R interaction might contribute to the neurodegenerative disorder observed in Huntington patients . Here we show that the recently identiﬁed S . pombe orthologue of Sc - SLA2 ( End4 / Sla2 ) ( Iwaki et al . , 2004 ) is enriched at sites of actin accumulation in ﬁssion yeast , is required for polarized cell growth and organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and its localization at the new end depends on Tea1 . We conclude that End4 / Sla2 is required at the new end to organize or activate a new growth zone . Materials and Methods Strains and media All S . pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Standard methods were used for growth , transformation and genetic manipulations ( Moreno et al . , 1991 ) . All experiments , unless otherwise stated , were performed in YES ( yeast extract with added 250 mg / l histidine , adenine , leucine and uridine ) . sla2 ∆ , sla2 - GFP and sla2 ∆ talin were generated using a PCR - based method ( Bahler et al . , 1998 ) with a kanMX template and oligos with 60 - 80 nt long homology to sla2 . Sla2R1083G was generated using the same approach , with an oligonucleotide bearing the point mutation . All deletions , mutations and tagging were performed in a diploid strain and then sporulated to produce viable haploids . Deletions and insertions were checked by PCR for presence of a KanMX cassette at the right locus . Point mutants were conﬁrmed by sequencing of genomic DNAs . Actin and FM4 - 64 staining and immunoﬂuorescence For actin staining , cells were ﬁxed by adding formaldehyde ( with a ﬁnal concentration of 3 . 7 % ) to the medium for 25 minutes , washed twice with PEM ( 100 mM Pipes , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgSO 4 , pH 6 . 9 ) , permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 , washed twice with PEM and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . FM4 - 64 staining was performed as described by Brazer et al . ( Brazer et al . , 2000 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were pelleted and resuspended in YES containing 10 nM FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) . Cells were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes , then washed , resuspended in fresh YES medium at a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells / ml and grown at 25°C . Staining was monitored every 5 minutes for up to 2 hours using an Axioplan Zeiss microscope ( 546 nm ) . For immunoﬂuorescence , cells were collected by ﬁltration and ﬁxed in – 80°C methanol for 8 minutes and processed as described previously ( Alfa et al . , 1993 ) . For microtubule detection , TAT1 ( α - tubulin ; a kind gift from K . Gull ) antibody was used at 1 : 200 dilution , and Alexa Fluor 546 - linked anti - mouse ( Molecular Probes ) at 1 : 1000 was used as secondary antibody . Photographs were taken using an Axioplan Zeiss microscope . Latranculin A , MBC and brefeldin A treatments Cells were grown at 25°C in YES to OD 595 0 . 5 . Methyl - 2 - benzimidazole - carbamate ( MBC ) and brefeldin A ( BfA ) were then added to the medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 25 µ g / ml and 100 µ g / ml , respectively . Sla2 - GFP - expressing cells were ﬁxed with – 80°C methanol and stained for tubulin . Fluorescence from Sla2 - GFP is very strong and was still visible after ﬁxation . For latranculin A ( latA ) treatment , Sla2 - GFP - expressing cells were ﬁxed to a coverslip coated with lectin ( 100 µ g / ml ) . Medium containing 40 µ M latA was ﬂushed under the coverslip and time - lapse images were taken every 2 seconds . For block and release experiments , cdc10 - 129 cells were blocked for 3 hours ( unless otherwise stated ) at the restrictive temperature ( 36°C ) . Following drug addition ( at appropriate concentrations as previously stated ) , cells were quickly released to the permissive temperature ( 25°C ) and samples for immunoﬂuorescence and Sla2 - GFP were taken at different time points . For latA treatment , cells were ﬁltered following the block and resuspended in 1 / 10 of the original volume in medium containing 40 µ M latA . After 10 minutes cells were released to permissive temperature and stained after 30 minutes . LatA pulse experiments were performed as described by Rupes et al . ( Rupes et al . , 1999 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were blocked at restrictive temperature for 3 hours . Aliquots were ﬁltered and resuspended in 1 / 10 volume of medium containing 40 µ M latA for 6 minutes at 36°C . LatA was then washed out by ﬁltration , cells were washed with preconditioned medium and resuspended in fresh medium . Cells were ﬁxed for actin staining at 30 - minute time intervals . Results End4 / Sla2 is involved in actin organization We identiﬁed the sla2 gene in the S . pombe genome database by homology with the S . cerevisiae sla2 gene . S . pombe sla2 ( SPAC688 . 11 ) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 123 kDa . Sequence alignment with other Sla2 - related proteins showed that End4 / Sla2 shares 36 % similarity with Sc - SLA2 and 26 % similarity with human HIP1R . End4 / Sla2 has the same domain structure and organization as the other Sla2 - related proteins , namely an N - terminal ENTH ( epsin N - terminal homology ) domain , a central coiled coil region , and a C - terminal talin - like domain . The talin - like domain contains the I / LWEQ - module predicted to bind to F - actin ( McCann and Craig , 1999 ) . sla2 was deleted in a wild - type diploid using a PCR - based approach ( Bahler et al . , 1998 ) . As in S . cerevisiae , sla2 ∆ cells were temperature sensitive for growth ; cells failed to grow at 36°C and at 32°C , and grew slowly at 25°C with a doubling time of about 6 hours , more than twice that of wild - type cells ( 2 hours 50 minutes ) . sla2 ∆ cells grown at 25°C were wider than wild - type cells and showed a variety of growth patterns : cells were often branched , swollen in their middle regions or exhibited a complete loss of polarity ( Fig . 1 ) . sla2 ∆ cells had an aberrant actin cytoskeleton . In wild - type interphase cells , F - actin is organized in polarized cortical patches enriched at growing tips and in thin cables running Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 9 ) Table 1 .

In contrast , about half of sla2 ∆ cells at 25°C showed misoriented cables ( data not shown ) and disorganized cortical structures , with actin patches delocalized throughout the cell body ( Fig . 1C ) . In the cells , which maintained the normal rod shape at 25°C , actin patches were observed only at one end ( data not shown ) . After shifting to 36°C for 2 hours , sla2 ∆ cells became round and swollen and the actin patches became completely delocalized around the cortex , and medial rings could no longer be detected ( Table 2 ) . sla2 ∆ cells with extreme polarity defects had microtubules curling under the cortex ( data not shown ) . However , at 25°C cells that still retained polarity showed a normal microtubule cytoskeleton , with three to four bundles running along the main axis of the cell ( Fig . 1B ) . In these cells , Tea1 accumulated at opposite ends , as in wild - type cells ( Fig . 1D ) . To investigate further the role of End4 / Sla2 in actin organization , we generated a talin deletion of End4 / Sla2 . As the talin - like domain is dispensable for most Sc - SLA2 functions in S . cerevisiae ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) , we reasoned that this deletion might speciﬁcally interfere with actin regulation . A strain bearing a talin - truncated version of End4 / Sla2 ( sla2 ∆ talin ) was viable at all temperatures and grew at rates similar to those of wild type . As in budding yeast ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) , no obvious difference in bulk lipid endocytosis ( by up - take of the lipophilic steryl dye FM4 - 64 ) was detected between wild - type and sla2 ∆ talin cells ( data not shown ) . As shown by calcoﬂuor staining ( Fig . 2B ) , the only defect detected in this strain was that most cells grew from only one end . Like wild - type cells , sla2 ∆ talin cells had actin cables running along the main axis of the cell and cortical actin patches at growing ends . Unlike the wild - type population , where only 15 % of cells were in a pre - NETO state and showed monopolar actin , 78 % of sla2 ∆ talin cells had a monopolar distribution of cortical actin patches ( Fig . 2A , B ) . The growth pattern of sla2 ∆ talin cells was further analysed by time - lapse phase - contrast microscopy . In wild - type cells after ﬁssion , both daughter cells activate growth from the old end ( growing in the previous cycle ) . In contrast , in 53 % of sla2 ∆ talin cells one daughter cell grew from the old end and one from the new end ( Fig . 2D ) . Deletion of the talin - like domain did not affect End4 / Sla2 protein levels ( Fig . 2C ) . Moreover , sla2 ∆ talin cells showed no obvious defect in bulk lipid endocytosis , using the FM4 - 64 uptake assay ( data not shown ) . Thus as in S . cerevisiae , the C - terminal talin - like domain is dispensable for most End4 / Sla2 functions . However , in S . pombe the End4 / Sla2 talin - like domain is required for activation of growth at the new end , and possibly mediates recruitment of actin to the new end . Further support for this was obtained by mutating arginine 1083 , which abolishes binding of the isolated I / LWEQ - module to F - actin ( McCann and Craig , 1999 ) . Cells bearing this point mutation ( Sla2R1083G ) in End4 / Sla2 showed NETO defects ; 62 % of cells grew in a monopolar fashion with a monopolar actin pattern ( Fig . 2A ) . To test if the talin - like domain plays an essential role in the switch to bipolar growth , we checked whether it was possible to promote NETO in sla2 ∆ talin cells by making actin monomers available in the cell . A pool of free actin monomers could be generated with a pulse of latranculin A ( latA ) ( Rupes et al . , 1999 ) . Cdc10 - 129 and cdc10 - 129 sla2 ∆ talin cells were blocked for 2 hours at restrictive temperature ( 36°C ) . After the block , cells of both genotypes showed a monopolar actin distribution : 89 % in cdc10 - 129 and 98 % in cdc10 - 129 sla2 ∆ talin cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Cells were than treated for 6 minutes with 40 µ M latA , which completely disrupted actin localization ( Fig . 3B ) . After washing out the drug , actin localization was followed for up to 120 minutes at 36°C . Within 1 hour most cdc10 - 129 cells showed a bipolar actin distribution , whereas most cells bearing the talin deletion in End4 / Sla2 had monopolar actin patches . As shown in Fig . 3A , 2 hours after wash out of the drug , 76 % of cdc10 - 129 cells showed a bipolar actin distribution compared to 22 % of cdc10 - 129 sla2 ∆ talin cells . These results suggest that End4 / Sla2 talin - like domain plays an essential role in the switch from monopolar to bipolar growth and in the organization of cortical actin patches at the new end .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1846 End4 / Sla2 is enriched at sites of actin accumulation We next determined the localization of End4 / Sla2 in the cell throughout the cell cycle by using a C - terminal Sla2 - GFP fusion expressed from the sla2 endogenous promoter . The GFP fusion protein is functional , as Sla2 - GFP fully rescued the defects observed in sla2 ∆ cells . During interphase , Sla2 - GFP accumulated in cortical dots at both cell ends ( Fig . 4A ) at the site of cell growth and actin patch accumulation . Evaluation of individual Sla2 - GFP patches revealed a lifetime of 110 - 150 seconds . During early mitosis , Sla2 - GFP dots form a ring in the middle of the cell , overlying the nucleus , which persists until the end of mitosis ( Fig . 4A ) . Upon cell division , Sla2 - GFP localization was re - established at the old end . Time - lapse movies ( data not shown ) of single cells expressing Sla2 - GFP showed that after cell division only a few dots were left at the new end . Shortly after division , Sla2 - GFP quickly accumulated again at cell ends , giving rise to the bipolar interphase pattern ( data not shown ) . To determine whether End4 / Sla2 accumulates only at growing cell ends , we examined the pattern of Sla2 - GFP localization in the temperature - sensitive cell cycle mutants cdc10 - 129 and cdc25 - 22 ( Mitchison and Nurse , 1985 ) , which block before and after activation of bipolar growth , respectively . When shifted to the restrictive temperature , cdc10 - 129 cells blocked , before NETO , with monopolar actin and monopolar Sla2 - GFP distribution ( Fig . 4D ) . Conversely , cdc25 - 22 cells , at restrictive temperature , blocked entry into mitosis and accumulated as long rod - shaped cells with bipolar actin and bipolar Sla2 - GFP ( data not shown ) . We conclude that End4 / Sla2 has a distribution that mirrors that of the cortical actin patches , accumulating at actively growing tips during interphase and re - localizing to a central ring prior to mitosis . However , co - staining of Sla2 - GFP and actin showed only a partial colocalization of End4 / Sla2 dots and actin patches ( Fig . 4D , E ) . The proper location of new growth zones relies on the polarity marker Tea1 , which deﬁnes cell geometry by marking sites of cell growth ( Mata and Nurse , 1997 ) . Double labelling of Sla2 - GFP - expressing cells with GFP and Tea1 antibodies showed some colocalization of the two proteins at cell tips ( Fig . 4F ) . As End4 / Sla2 also associates closely with the actin cytoskeleton and the growth machinery , we tested whether its localization depends on Tea1 . The central accumulation of Sla2 - GFP at the ring was unaffected in tea1 ∆ cells , whereas the end localization of Sla2 - GFP was abnormal .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1847 End4 / Sla2 and polarized growth normal bipolar localization , most cells showed monopolar Sla2 - GFP accumulation at the growing end ( Fig . 4B ) throughout the cell cycle , suggesting a role for Tea1 in proper End4 / Sla2 localization . However , because Tea1 inﬂuences microtubular organization , the aberrant pattern of Sla2 - GFP localization could also be an indirect consequence of the defective microtubular array observed in tea1 ∆ cells . To distinguish between these two possibilities , we examined the pattern of Sla2 - GFP localization in tea1 ∆ ( 200 ) cells , which show a wild - type array of microtubules but fail to accumulate the truncated version of Tea1 at cell ends ( Behrens and Nurse , 2002 ) . tea1 ∆ ( 200 ) cells showed monopolar Sla2 - GFP accumulation which occurred only at growing ends , even though microtubules were normal in these cells ( Fig . 4C ) . Hence , Tea1 is necessary to recruit End4 / Sla2 to the new end where growth has not previously occurred , independently of its effect on microtubules . To further test if the accumulation of End4 / Sla2 at cell ends required the microtubule or actin cytoskeletons , we performed a cdc10 block and release experiment in the presence of 25 µ g / ml MBC , which depolymerizes microtubules , or 40 µ M latA , which sequesters actin monomers leading to complete disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton . Cells were blocked at the restrictive temperature of 36°C for 3 hours to allow most cells to accumulate in G1 with monopolar Sla2 - GFP . Cells were then released to the permissive temperature in MBC or latA to allow cells to proceed through the cell cycle in the absence of microtubules or F - actin structures , respectively . As shown in Fig . 5 , neither the MBC nor the latA treatment impaired Sla2 - GFP accumulation at the new end . Bipolar accumulation of Sla2 - GFP was also observed when cells were treated with both MBC and latA together , excluding the possibility of a redundant dependence between the two systems ( Fig . 5 ) . Taken together these observations suggest that End4 / Sla2 end localization does not directly require the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons . End4 / Sla2 localization depends on vesicular traffic In ﬁssion yeast , membrane trafficking is required for proper actin ring dynamics and affects its localization ( Pardo and Nurse , 2003 ) . The presence of a ENTH domain , shown to be involved in membrane binding ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ) at the C terminus of End4 / Sla2 , and the tight association of End4 / Sla2 with the cortical membrane after latA treatment , led us to investigate whether membrane trafficking is also involved in localizing End4 / Sla2 at cell ends . Brefeldin A ( BfA ) blocks protein secretion by blocking vesicular transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and therefore disrupting the Golgi apparatus . Treatment with BfA does not affect Tea1 localization ( Mata and Nurse , 1997 ) , but it caused Sla2 - GFP to disappear completely from cell tips , becoming randomly distributed throughout the cell within 5 minutes ( Fig . 6Ac ) , suggesting that End4 / Sla2 accumulation at cell ends might be mediated by active vesicular trafficking . Conversely , treatment with 40 µ M latA ( Fig . 6Ab ) for up to 1 hour did not affect Sla2 - GFP end localization . Similarly , deletion of the actin binding talin - like domain has no effect on End4 / Sla2 localization . As shown in Fig . 6Ba , Sla2 ∆ talin - GFP accumulates at both cell ends . Co - staining of Sla2 ∆ talin - GFP and actin ( Fig . 6C ) shows accumulation of Sla2 ∆ talin - GFP at both growing and not - growing ends . However , similarly to budding yeast where latA treatment abolishes Sc - SLA2 movement ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , the rapid and apparently random movement of Sla2 - GFP dots near the cell cortex was completely blocked by addition of 40 µ M latA to the medium ( Fig . 6D ) . BfA - dependent delocalization of Sla2 - GFP was also suppressed by the simultaneous addition of 40 µ M latA ( Fig . 6Ad ) , as well as by the deletion of the talin - like domain ( Fig . 6Bc ) . Thus End4 / Sla2 localization requires active vesicular trafficking and is only maintained at cell ends for a short time of around 5 minutes . We conclude that rapid removal of End4 / Sla2 from cell ends requires the actin cytoskeleton and the talin - like domain . Discussion We have identiﬁed End4 / Sla2 as a protein required to recruit actin and the growth machinery to the new cell end in ﬁssion yeast . Phenotypic analysis of sla2 ∆ mutants showed that this gene is required for proper actin organization and cell Fig . 4 . End4 / Sla2 localization in vivo .

Cells lacking End4 / Sla2 have an aberrant shape and a depolarized cortical actin cytoskeleton . This phenotype is reminiscent of that shown by deletion of Sc - sla2 . In budding yeast , sla2 ∆ cells are spherical and have delocalized cortical actin structures , with aggregated actin patches dispersed throughout the cytoplasm ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Deletion of Sc - sla2 also caused defects in endocytosis ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Sc - SLA2 is involved in the internalization step of endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) , but does not require its C - terminal talin - like domain for bulk lipid endocytosis ( Baggett et al . , 2003 ) . Recent work by Iwaki et al . showed that in ﬁssion yeast , End4 / Sla2 is also required for endocytosis ( Iwaki et al . , 2004 ) . Deletion of the end4 / sla2 gene inhibits delivery of FM4 - 64 to the vacuolar membrane , accumulation of luciferase yellow CH and internalization of the membrane protein Map3 ( Iwaki et al . , 2004 ) . Although we cannot exclude a defect in receptor - mediated endocytosis as is observed in S . cerevisiae at elevated temperatures ( Baggett et al . , 2003 ) , we observed no defects in ﬂuid phase endocytosis ( assayed by FM4 - 64 uptake ) when the C - terminal talin - like domain of End4 / Sla2 was deleted . Our analysis of the sla2 ∆ talin strain instead uncovered a novel function for End4 / Sla2 in establishment of new growth zones in ﬁssion yeast . Moreover , in contrast with previous work in S . cerevisiae ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) and in Candida albicans ( Asleson et al . , 2001 ) , which attributed only a marginal role to the talin - like domain , our data suggest a role for the talin - like domain in the recruitment of actin and activation of growth at new cell ends . Sla2 ∆ talin cells are , in fact , NETO defective , with monopolar actin patches . End4 / Sla2 talin - like domain mutant cells fail to activate growth at the new end but do polarize growth at the old end and grow in a monopolar fashion . Unlike ssp1 ∆ cells , which can activate bipolar growth upon latA treatment ( Rupes et al . , 1999 ) , sla2 ∆ talin cells have lost their intrinsic ability to activate growth at the new end , and their NETO defect cannot be overcome by an artiﬁcial increase in free actin monomers . Hence End4 / Sla2 has an essential role in linking actin organization and growth . Since the truncated protein localizes to both the growing and the non - growing end , however , the role played by the talin - like domain might be restricted to establishment of bipolar growth . As the talin - like domain binds actin both in vitro ( McCann and Craig , 1999 ) and in two - hybrid assays ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) , it is tempting to suggest that End4 / Sla2 acts downstream of the polarity machinery at the interface with actin , and that the NETO defect seen in sla2 ∆ talin cells is due to the inability of the truncated protein to either polymerize or stabilize actin at the new end despite the presence of polarity markers . However , given that it has also been suggested that the talin - like domain is required for protein - protein interaction and regulation of Sc - SLA2 activity ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) , an alternative explanation could be that the truncated form is inactive or unable to interact with the growth machinery . Full deletion of Sla2 / End4 , which affects endocytosis as well as actin organization , leads to complete loss of polarity , whereas deletion of the talin - like domain , which does not interfere with bulk endocytosis , does not affect polarized growth but does inﬂuence establishment of new sites of polarized growth . Interestingly in budding yeast , sla2 - 6 mutant cells , which , unlike sla2 ∆ cells , grow well at all temperatures and show polarized actin , exhibit a bipolar budding defect ( Yang et al . , 1997 ) . This suggests that in both ﬁssion and budding yeast Sla2 might have two independent functions : to maintain polarized cell growth ( requiring the full length protein ) and to promote NETO / distal budding . Formally , however it is also possible , at least in S . pombe , that End4 / Sla2 is required only for establishment of polarized growth , with activation at the new end requiring a higher level of activity and therefore being more readily affected by alteration of the protein , such as the deletion of the talin - like domain . As previously suggested for Orb3 , Orb8 and Orb9 ( Snell and Nurse , 1994 ; Verde et al . , 1995 ) , End4 / Sla2 might be required to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton after a major cell cycle transition , such as mitosis . Remarkably the general loss of polarization observed in sla2 ∆ cells resembles that shown by orb mutants at restrictive temperature ( Snell and Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 9 ) Fig . 5 . Localization of Sla2 - GFP is independent of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons . ( A ) cdc10 - 129 cells expressing Sla2 - GFP were grown at 25°C and then transferred to 36°C for 3 hours ( left ) . After addition of DMSO or 40 µ M latA or 25 µ g / ml MBC , or 25 µ g / ml MBC plus 40 µ M latA ( indicated by an arrow in the scheme ) respectively , cells were released to permissive temperature ( 25°C ) for an hour in the presence of the drug and then analysed for Sla2 - GFP localization ( right panels ) .

Interestingly most of the orb genes identiﬁed so far encode protein kinases and Sc - SLA2 is phosphorylated ( Ficarro et al . , 2002 ) in logarithmically growing cells . This phosphorylation has been suggested as a potential regulatory switch to trigger End4 / Sla2 - actin interaction at the cell cortex ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) making End4 / Sla2 a candidate downstream target of the Orb morphogenetic pathway . In the rod - shaped ﬁssion yeast it is thought that the plus ends of microtubules deﬁne cell ends by delivering polarity markers such as Tea1 ( Mata and Nurse , 1997 ) . End4 / Sla2 in also enriched at cell ends during interphase and is therefore a good candidate to play a direct role in the recruitment / assembly of cortical polar actin . Consistently , End4 / Sla2 end localization is independent of microtubules but requires Tea1 to recognize the end where growth has not previously occurred . Cells lacking Tea1 do not accumulate End4 / Sla2 at the new end and fail to undergo NETO . Therefore our work places End4 / Sla2 as a link between microtubules and the machinery involved in sensing overall cell space and the actin cytoskeleton , which leads to polarized growth . In this model Tea1 would mark new sites of cell growth and recruit End4 / Sla2 , which in turn could initiate accumulation of cortical actin . Tea1 and End4 / Sla2 only partially colocalize at cell ends . However , if Tea1 is only required for the initial recruitment of End4 / Sla2 but not for its maintenance at cell ends , their interaction could be only transient , and no longer be necessary once the End4 / Sla2 - cortex interaction was established . The functional interaction between Tea1 and End4 / Sla2 might reﬂect a direct physical interaction , and consistent with this we could detect a direct interaction between the C terminus of Tea1 and End4 / Sla2 in a two - hybrid assay ( our unpublished observation ) , although we could not conﬁrm it in vitro in ﬁssion yeast cell extracts . It is also possible that End4 / Sla2 acts in conjunction with other factors such as Bud6 , a factor required for NETO and shown to physically associate with Tea1 ( Glynn et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , bud6 ∆ and sla2 ∆ talin show the same growth patter ( Glynn et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , the proper localization of both Bud6 ( Jin and Amberg , 2000 ) and End4 / Sla2 ( BfA experiment , this study ) is mediated by the secretory pathway and requires Tea1 . Interestingly , it was postulated that the secretion and endocytosis might be coupled : the secretory pathway being required to replenish components needed at the plasma membrane for endocytosis ( Riezman , 1985 ) . However , S . cerevisiae end3 mutant cells , which are defective in endocytosis , still grow and therefore have an active secretion pathway ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Although the coupling might not be essential , a functional link might still exist . Localized secretion may be required to accumulate proteins at sites of growth , and localised endocytosis could deﬁne and delimit the growth zone to cell tips by removing excess factors from neighbouring areas . In this scenario , depolarized endocytosis would result in loss of cellular domains and consequently in loss of polarity , as seen in sla2 ∆ cells . Studies in other organisms have shown that , as in ﬁssion yeast , Sla2 homologues are enriched in subcellular regions , which show elevated membrane turnover and actin accumulation . Hip1 , the human homologue of Sla2 , colocalizes with and binds to clathrin and adaptor protein - 2 ( AP2 ) ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ) , both highly enriched at presynaptic nerve terminals , where they facilitate rapid retrieval of synaptic vesicles ( De Camilli et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ) . Hip1 was identiﬁed through its interaction with huntingtin ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Wanker et al . , 1997 ) , a protein containing a polyglutamine stretch . Polyglutamine expansion causes a decrease in the Hip1 - huntingtin interaction and is associated with the onset of Huntington’s disease ( HD ) . Huntingtin , like Tea1 , associates with microtubules ( Gutekunst et al . , 1995 ; Hoffner et al . , 2002 ; Muchowski et al . , 2002 ; Tukamoto et al . , 1997 ) , and so Sla2 / Hip1 family proteins may have a conserved role working at the interface between the actin and microtubular networks .
