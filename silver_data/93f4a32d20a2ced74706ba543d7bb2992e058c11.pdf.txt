Introduction Most cells of the body are subjected to physiological events during normal functions that can lead to disruption of the cell’s plasma membrane ( McNeil and Steinhardt , 2003 ; Martin and Parkhurst , 2004 ) . The capacity of single cells to repair day - to - day wear - and - tear injuries , as well as traumatic ones , is fun - damental for maintaining tissue integrity . In addition , cells can become damaged as a result of disease , such as the fragile skin cells of Epidermolysa bullosa simplex patients and myocytes of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients , or in response to bac - terial toxin lesions ( Coulombe et al . , 1991 ; Petrof et al . , 1993 ; Gilbert , 2002 ) . Upon disruption of the plasma membrane , an influx of calcium signals the deployment of vesicles that fuse with each other and with the plasma membrane to plug the hole ( McNeil and Kirchhausen , 2005 ) . After the membrane has been sealed , repair of the cell’s cortical cytoskeleton is required to reestablish a normal cytoarchitecture ( Fein and Terasaki , 2005 ) . Cytoskeleton remodeling is mediated by a contractile ring of F - actin and myosin , accompanied by a radial arrangement of microtubules , and requires a specific signal transduction re - sponse involving Rho family GTPases ( Bement et al . , 2007 ) . Drosophila has recently emerged as a genetic model for studying multicellular wound repair ( Kiehart et al . , 2000 ; Wood et al . , 2002 ; Galko and Krasnow , 2004 ; Stramer et al . , 2005 ) . Here we show that the Drosophila embryo is an excellent model in which to interrogate the single - cell wound - healing process . We use 4D in vivo microscopy along with pharmacological and genetic manipulations to define the series of changes that occur during three distinctive phases in response to wounding . We find that specific molecular components including actin , myo - sin , microtubules , and the plasma membrane respond dynami - cally during cell wound repair , and demonstrate that perturbations of each of these components yield abnormal wound healing . For the first time , we show a requirement for E - cadherin in single - cell wound repair , providing new mechanistic insight into this wound - healing process . W hen single cells or tissues are injured , the wound must be repaired quickly in order to prevent cell death , loss of tissue integrity , and invasion by microorganisms . We describe Drosophila as a geneti - cally tractable model to dissect the mechanisms of single - cell wound repair . By analyzing the expression and the effects of perturbations of actin , myosin , microtubules , E - cadherin , and the plasma membrane , we define three distinct phases in the repair process—expansion , contraction , and closure—and identify specific components required during each phase . Specifically , plasma membrane mobilization and assembly of a contractile actomyosin ring are required for this process . In addition , E - cadherin accumulates at the wound edge , and wound expansion is excessive in E - cadherin mutants , suggesting a role for E - cadherin in anchoring the actomyosin ring to the plasma membrane . Our results show that single - cell wound repair requires spe - cific spatial and temporal cytoskeleton responses with dis - tinct components and mechanisms required at different stages of the process . Cell wound repair in Drosophila occurs through three distinct phases of membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling Maria Teresa Abreu - Blanco , Jeffrey M . Verboon , and Susan M .

In particular , a radial arrangement of microtubules associated with F - actin is observed at the wound border in Xenopus oocytes ( Mandato and Bement , 2003 ) . We evaluated the recruitment of microtubules in vivo using GFP –  - tubulin and did not detect a significant accumulation or rearrangement of microtubules at the wound edge ( Fig . 1 , I and I  ; Fig . S1 C ) . However , perturbation of the microtubule network did have a negative effect on wound repair in our single - cell model . Em - bryos treated with colchicine ( inhibitor of microtubule poly - merization ) show defects in actin ring assembly : some embryos fail to assemble an actin ring ( n = 7 / 15 ) ; other embryos assem - ble a disorganized cable that is broad and unstable ( n = 8 / 15 ; Fig . 1 , J – J  ) . These results indicate that although microtubules do not visibly rearrange at the wound edge , they are required for proper assembly of the actin ring . As our analyses of cell wound repair in the early embryo show a rapid and specific recruitment of actin , we examined the contribution of myosin II in the repair response . Laser wound - ing of embryos coexpressing GFP - Spaghetti squash ( myosin regulatory light chain , sqh - GFP ) and actin ( sChMCA ) show that myosin II is immediately recruited to the wound edge ( 45 s ) , forms a ring that overlaps with actin throughout the repair process , and starts to dissipate 10 min after wounding ( Fig . 2 A – A  ; Video 3 ; Fig . S1 G ) . In early time points , single Z sections across the wound reveal that while the rings of actin and myosin overlap , myosin is more abundant at the leading edge of the wound , whereas actin accumulation is broader ( Fig . 2 B ) . By 5 min the actomyosin ring split into three zones : an apical layer of actin , a middle overlapping actomyosin zone , and a basal zone enriched in myosin II ( Fig . 2 B ) . To further examine the role of myosin II in single - cell wound repair , we studied the effects of altering the levels of myosin genetically . Homozygous sqh 1 mutant embryos show severe developmental defects with few embryos completing development ( Wheatley et al . , 1995 ) . In embryos that do de - velop , the wound repair response is severely impaired : upon ab - lation , wounds expand normally but fail to contract ( Fig . 2 C ; Video 4 ) . Kymograph analysis of these mutants shows incom - plete actin ring formation at the wound edge compared with the wild type ( Fig . 2 C  ) . Actin accumulation is significantly reduced and any cable that forms appears disorganized and unstable ; as a consequence the wounds reopen ( n = 4 / 4 ) . Inhibition of myo - sin II phosphorylation by treatment with Y27632 , a specific Rho kinase inhibitor ( Narumiya et al . , 2000 ) , similarly disrupts cell wound repair ( Fig . S1 , H – H  ; Video 4 ) . The myosin cytoskel - eton is also disrupted in Lat B – treated embryos : both actin and myosin fail to be recruited to the wound edge ( not depicted ) . Together , our data suggest that myosin II is required for the sta - bilization of actin at the leading edge of wounds . We next sought to interrogate another critical step for cell wound repair : the rapid resealing of the plasma membrane disruption . The current working model for single - cell wound repair proposes that internal vesicles directionally migrate to the wound site , then fuse with the damaged plasma membrane to Results and discussion Repair of single cells is mainly studied in sea urchin eggs , Xenopus oocytes , and cultured cells ( McNeil and Steinhardt , 2003 ) . As the first 13 nuclear divisions in the Drosophila em - bryo are not accompanied by cytokinesis , the early fly embryo can be considered as a giant single cell ( Foe and Alberts , 1983 ) . The early embryo’s multinucleate nature is not unlike that of muscle cells—one of the major mammalian cell types under - going continuous membrane tearing and using single - cell repair mechanisms ( McNeil and Khakee , 1992 ) . We used early stage Drosophila embryos ( NC4 – 6 ) as a model to study single - cell wound repair ( Fig . 1 , A – C ) , allowing us to follow the wound repair process at the cortical surface without interference by the nuclear division process . We generated wounds on the lateral surface of these embryos by laser ablation of the cortical surface without disrupting the overlying vitelline membrane . Analysis of single - cell wound repair in NC4 staged embryos expressing actin ( sGMCA , spaghetti squash – driven , GFP , moesin  - helical – coiled and actin binding site ) allowed us to divide single - cell wound repair into three distinct steps based on the repair dynamics : ( 1 ) expansion , ( 2 ) contraction , and ( 3 ) closure ( Fig . 1 E ) . Upon wounding the cortical actin disappears and the initial wound area rapidly expands . This expansion phase occurs during the first 30 – 60 s after wounding ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . Once actin accumulates in a ring flanking the wound , the diameter reduces progressively ( contraction ) , followed by a slower closure phase ( Fig . 1 , D and E ; Video 1 ) . We find that neither wound size nor embryo age before cellularization affects single - cell wound repair dynamics ( Fig . 1 F ; Fig . S1 , B and B  ; Table S1 ; see Materials and methods ) . Our assays in the early Drosophila embryo show that wounding triggers the rapid recruitment of actin to the edge of the hole ( Fig . 1 , D and D  ) . Actin is first detected at the wound edge 30 s after wounding . By 60 s , a continuous actin ring is observed and is maintained for at least 20 min ( Fig . 1 D ; Video 1 ) . The correlation between actin recruitment and wound con - striction suggests that actin may drive both the hole contraction and closure in the fly model , as has been described in the Xenopus oocyte single - cell repair model ( Bement et al . , 1999 ; Mandato and Bement , 2001 ) . To test this hypothesis , we perturbed the actin cytoskeleton by treatment with latrunculin B ( Lat B ) , an inhibitor of actin polymerization . We injected Lat B in early embryos expressing actin ( sChMCA ) and plasma membrane ( GFP - Spider ) markers . Actin was significantly disrupted ( Fig . 1 , G and H ) , resulting in altered repair dynamics with wounds ex - panding for more than 5 min ( Fig . 1 G ) . Although actin is even - tually recruited to the wound edge as the embryos begin to recover from the Lat B treatment , this accumulation is discon - tinuous , resulting in impaired contraction and a disrupted wound area that remains open 15 min after wounding compared with 5 min in control embryos ( Fig . 1 G ; Fig . S1 D ; Video 2 ) . In em - bryos with incomplete actin depolymerization ( Fig . 1 H ) , a partial actin ring can assemble at the wound periphery , in areas where some actin still persists . Once contraction begins in one region of the leading edge , other regions with depolymerized actin are pulled along , resulting in imperfect and delayed repair ( Fig . 1 H ) . Thus , assembly of an actin ring is required for single - cell wound repair . 457 Single - cell wound repair • Abreu - Blanco et al . Figure 1 .

JCB • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 3 • 2011 458 The other two plasma membrane components assayed , PH - PLC and GAP43 , display similar patterns to Spider . Both of these proteins localize at the wound edge shortly after wound - ing ( 1 min ; Fig . 3 , D – E  ; Video 5 ) and fuse with the membrane plug beneath the wound . Significantly , the wound area is en - riched in vesicles containing GAP43 , which move toward and fuse with the forming membrane plug ( Fig . 3 E  ) . Quantifica - tion of these GAP43 particles shows a higher density in the area just adjacent to the wound ( Fig . 3 E  ) . Our pharmacological inhibitor assays show that intact actin , myosin , and microtubule cytoskeleton are required for this plasma membrane mobiliza - tion ( Fig . 1 G  ; Fig . S1 , F and G  ) . Therefore , in response to single - cell wounds , plasma membrane components are actively recruited to the wound and are responsible for forming the patch necessary to reseal the membrane hole . As we find that membrane in the form of vesicles is rapidly recruited to the wound in a process that is actin , myosin , and microtubule dependent , important questions are how this new “plug” of membrane becomes anchored to form a continuous create a membrane patch ( McNeil and Kirchhausen , 2005 ) . We examined the role of plasma membrane using three membrane markers , each of which has a different mode of membrane attachment : casein kinase 1  ( GFP - Spider ; Frescas et al . , 2006 ) , growth - associated protein 43 ( GAP43 - ChFP ; Martin et al . , 2010 ) , and the pleckstrin - homology domain of PLC ( GFP - PH - PLC ; Pinal et al . , 2006 ) . In embryos expressing GFP - Spider along with actin ( sChMCA ) , Spider accumulates at the leading edge of the wound internal to the actin ring ( Fig . 3 A – A  ) . We also observed a distinctive subcellular localization pattern of parti - cles containing Spider expanding basally at the wound site as deep as 5 µm ( Fig . 3 A  ) , whereas the accumulation of actin occurs at 3 µm beneath the wound surface ( Fig . 3 A  ) . Time lapse of GFP - Spider embryos shows accumulation at the wound edge 30 s after wounding ( Fig . 3 C ) and the recruitment of GFP - Spider associated with vesicles being delivered from beneath the wound and fusing with the forming membrane patch ( Video 5 ) . By 5 min after wounding a membrane plug can be observed below the wound ( Fig . 3 , B and B  ) . Figure 2 . Contribution of myosin II to single - cell wound repair .

Although cadherin - based adherens junctions appear to anchor the actomyosin cable in the epithelia of stage 15 embryos , DE - cadherin has not previously been observed in the early embryo before the onset of cellular - ization ( Tepass et al . , 2001 ) . As cadherin expression has not been well characterized during the early stages of Drosophila embryo development ( NC4 – 8 ) , we stained early staged embryos expressing a nuclear marker ( His2Av - mRFP ) with a DE - cadherin – specific antibody ( Oda et al . , 1994 ) . Confocal images show a punctate pattern of membrane at the cell surface and how the actin ring is associated with the plasma membrane . Studies from Xenopus oocytes sug - gest that the actin ring is anchored to the membrane at frequent intervals along the length of the wound ( Mandato and Bement , 2001 ) . This explains how actin cable contraction can mediate wound closure and how the cable can dynamically change size to adjust as closure progresses . However , it is not known how this anchoring is achieved . In epithelial wound repair , cadherin - based adherens junctions serve as anchors connecting inter - cellular segments of the actomyosin cable ( indirectly ) between Figure 3 .

In single - cell wound repair myosin II could act as a scaffold or a trigger for the clustering and recruitment of cadherin to the wound leading edge . By combining high resolution imaging and multiple fluorescence markers in both wild - type and mutant embryos , the Drosophila single - cell repair model facilitates the systematic analysis of specific components and provides new mechanistic insights on how these components are specifically recruited and dynamically localized during the healing process ( Fig . 5 ) . Although basic descriptions of single - cell wound repair are in place from studies in different wound models , a number of fun - damental questions remain concerning the molecular details of these processes . What are the signals that recognize that the membrane has been disrupted , and how do these signals act to initiate the critical first steps of healing ? In particular , what components of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal machineries are required to drive cellular processes critical for all elements of the repair process ? What are the signals that lead to dis - assembly of these machineries and cessation of the repair process once healing is complete ? The Drosophila embryo provides an excellent genetic model in which to systematically define the specific series of events of single - cell wound repair and identify the molecules required for each step . Materials and methods Fly strains and genetics Flies were cultured and crossed on yeast - cornmeal - molasses - malt and main - tained at 25°C . The following stocks containing fluorescence fusion proteins were used : sGMCA ( Kiehart et al . , 2000 ) , sChMCA ( this paper ) , P { His2Av - mRFP1 } III . 1 ( Bloomington Stock Center , Bloomington , IN ) , P { UASp - GFPS65C - alphaTub84B } ( GFP –  - tubulin , Bloomington Stock Center ) , Spider - GFP ( 95 – 1 ; Morin et al . , 2001 ) , sqh AX3 ; P { sqh - GFP } 42 ( sqh - GFP ; Royou et al . , 2004 ) , GAP43 - mCherry ( membrane - mCherry ; Martin et al . , 2010 ) , P { UASp - GPF - PH - PLC } ( Pinal et al . , 2006 ) , and ubi - DE - cadherin - GFP ( Oda and Tsukita , 2001 ; Kyoto Stock Center , Kyoto , Japan ) . Double fluores - cently tagged lines were generated using standard genetic methods . Expression of UASp - GPF - PH - PLC was driven in the embryo maternally in the early embryo with P { mat  4 - GAL - VP16 } V37 ( Bloomington Stock Center ) . The following mutant alleles were used : sqh 1 ( Wheatley et al . , 1995 ) , and shg k03401 ( Bloomington Stock Center ) . All mutant alleles to be examined were crossed into the background of sGMCA . Reduction of maternal expression for sqh and shg was achieved as follows : for sqh , we generated sqh 1 germ - line clones using the FLP - DFS system ( Chou and Perrimon , 1992 ) with sqh 1 FRT101 / FM7 and ovo D1 FRT101 / Y : hs - flp - F38 ( Wheatley et al . , 1995 ) ; for shg , maternally reduced shg k03401 embryos were generated using the wimp mutation ( Parkhurst and Ish - Horowicz , 1991 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Generation of sChMCA construct and transgenics To ubiquitously express fluorescently tagged proteins , we constructed an expression vector containing a 1 . 3 - kb genomic fragment covering the sqh promoter inserted into the PstI and StuI sites of pCasper4 . A fragment con - taining a region of the sqh 3  untranslated region ( 530 base pairs ) was then cloned downstream of the promoter into the XbaI and BamHI sites , re - sulting in pSqh5  + 3  UTR plasmid . Primers for cloning were designed based on the sequence reported by Kiehart et al . ( 2000 ) . The proteins of interest were then cloned between the sqh promoter and the 3  UTR in the pSqh5  + 3  UTR plasmid using the StuI and XbaI sites . A fusion of ChFP and the moesin actin - binding site was generated as follows : the moesin actin - binding domain was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with primers designed based on the sequence reported by Kiehart et al . ( 2000 ) , then fused to ChFP and cloned in the vector previously described as a SmaI – BamHI fragment . This construct was named sChMCA for sqh - driven , ChFP protein , moesin  - helical - coiled and actin binding site . sChMCA construct ( 500 µg / ml ) was injected along with the pTURBO helper cadherin expression , which can be detected as early as NC4 , where it is enriched in energids but excluded from nuclei ( Fig . 4 , A – A  ) . As the nuclei migrate toward the periphery , cad - herin distributes throughout the cortical surface of the embryo ( Fig . 4 , A – A  ; Fig . S2 , A – A  ) . Live imaging of embryos ex - pressing actin and cadherin ( sChMCA ; cadherin - GFP ) shows cadherin at the front of the pseudocleavage furrows as early as NC12 ( Fig . 4 B  ; Fig . S2 , B and B  ) . Western blot analysis of cadherin - GFP embryos corroborates that the fusion protein is not overexpressed ( Fig . 4 C ) . When conducting wound - healing assays in syncytial embryos expressing cadherin - GFP and actin ( sChMCA ) , sur - prisingly , we observed cadherin accumulation at the edge of the repairing hole ( Fig . 4 , D – D  ) . Cadherin localizes as a ring that overlaps with actin , and in cross sections cadherin - containing particles were observed mobilizing to the wound and accumu - lating at the wound border ( Fig . 4 D  ; Fig . S2 C ; Video 6 ) . Cadherin at the edge of single - cell wounds could serve a similar role as in multicellular wounds , linking the actomyosin ring to the plasma membrane . By examining wounds in maternally reduced shg k03401 embryos , we find that cadherin is required for cell wound repair ( Fig . 4 , E and E  ) . shg k03401 embryos show exces - sive expansion ( 2 . 6 - fold compared with wild type , P = 0 . 0009 ) , as well as defects in actin ring assembly ( Fig . 4 , F and G ) . In the most severe cases , actin ring formation is highly irregular , sug - gesting a role for cadherin in anchoring the actomyosin ring to the plasma membrane in single - cell wounds . Nevertheless , these embryos eventually heal ( Fig . 4 F ; Video 7 ) , suggesting a compensation mechanism perhaps by other proteins able to link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane . It will be interest - ing to see how other proteins involved in membrane – cytoskeleton interactions , such as ankyrin , spectrin , and ERM proteins , affect cell wound healing . We next investigated how DE - cadherin is mobilized to the wound border . By examining wounds in embryos expressing cadherin - GFP and GAP43 - ChFP , we find that membrane - associated cadherin is recruited from the area surrounding the wound where it accumulates in a ring around the membrane plug , but is excluded from the plug itself ( Fig . 4 , H and H  ) . We also detect cadherin particles trafficking toward the wound , which do not colocalize with plasma membrane vesicles ( Fig . 4 H  ) . To determine which cytoskeleton network mediates this cad - herin recruitment to the wound edge , we first examined em - bryos where myosin II was disrupted ( Y27632 treatment ) and found that cadherin fails to accumulate at the wound edge ( Fig . 4 , J and J  ) . Actin recruitment is also impaired in Y27632 - treated embryos and no significant accumulation of cadherin was observed in the resulting actin mesh ( Fig . 4 J  ) . In contrast , em - bryos with a disrupted microtubule network ( colchicine treat - ment ) show normal cadherin recruitment ( Fig . S3 D ) . Staining of early embryos with cadherin and myosin II – specific antibodies shows a similar distribution pattern during early development ( Fig . 4 K – K  ) . Our data suggest that DE - cadherin is recruited from two different sources : from the membrane surrounding the wound in an actomyosin - dependent mechanism and as actomyosin - independent particles trafficking from below the wound . Recent studies have shown that myosin II mediates E - cadherin JCB • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 3 • 2011 462 dishes made with hydrophilic gas - permeable membranes ( Sigma - Aldrich ) .

In brief , fixed embryos were incubated with the primary antibody , which has been previously preabsorbed against 0 – 4 h wild - type em - bryos . The embryos were then washed and incubated with the secondary antibody . Embryos were mounted in SlowFade Gold ( Invitrogen ) . Dro - sophila E - cadherin was recognized using rat anti - DCad2 ( 1 : 100 ; Devel - opmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA ) . Nonmuscle myosin was recognized using a specific antibody ( 1 : 500 ; Young et al . , 1991 ) . 2° antisera used : anti – rat Alexa 488 , anti – rabbit 488 , or anti – rat Alexa 568 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) . Confocal fluorescent microscopy All confocal imaging was performed at room temperature ( 23°C ) using an LSM - 510M microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) with excitation at 488 nm or 543 nm , and emission collection with BP - 500 - 550 or LP560 filters , respec - tively . A Plan Apochromat 20x / 0 . 75 NA dry objective was used for imaging . Images were processed in ImageJ ; all XY projections correspond to maxi - mum projections of the entire 25 - µm stack . Linear adjustments of brightness and contrast levels were applied in ImageJ . Figures were assembled in Canvas 8 ( Deneva ) . Embryo handling and preparation Early embryos were collected for 0 – 1 h at room temperature ( 23°C ) . Em - bryos were hand dechorionated , dried for 5 min , and transferred to series 700 halocarbon oil ( Halocarbon Products Corp . ) on Greiner Lumox culture Figure 5 .

On average , ablation time was less than 5 s , and time - lapse imaging was initiated immediately . We established conditions to produce reproducible wound size for the single - cell wounding and tested if wound size had any effect on the repair process . By controlling the size of the selected area and the intensity of the laser , we established the conditions for three different wound sizes ; the initial wound area was estimated after expansion was achieved . The wound sizes were classified as : ( a ) small , wound area < 500 µm 2 ; ( b ) me - dium , with areas ranging 500 – 1 , 000 µm 2 ; and ( c ) large wounds expand - ing > 1 , 000 µm 2 . With the exception of the expansion phase in large wounds , no significant differences were observed between the samples ( Fig . 1 F ; Table S1 ) . Unless otherwise indicated , all single - cell wound assays were conducted using small - size wounds . Image processing , analysis , and quantification Image series were either analyzed with Volocity software ( v . 5 . 3 . 0 ; Perkin - Elmer ) or were exported as TIFF files then imported into ImageJ for pro - cessing . XY projections correspond to maximum projections of the entire 27 – 30 - µm stack ; in all cases XZ cross sections were taken across the middle of the wound . Linear adjustments of brightness and contrasts levels were applied in ImageJ . Measurements of wound areas and ring width were done manually with ImageJ . A Student’s t test was used to analyze the data ; P < 0 . 05 was considered to be statistically significant . All graphs in - clude SEM bars . Quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed in ImageJ , using a region of interest ( 61 . 55 × 1 . 2 µm ) across the middle of the wound also covering the adjacent area . Heat maps were generated with ImageJ . All measurements were downloaded into Microsoft Excel and the data were graphed using Prism 5 . 0c ( GraphPad Software ) . Figures were assembled in Canvas 8 ( Deneva ) . Western blots To test the levels of DE - cadherin in embryos , we performed Western blots as previously described for cadherin ( Oda et al . , 1994 ) . Total embryo ex - tracts were prepared from sChMCA ; GFP – DE - cadherin or sGMCA ( control ) 0 – 1 - hour - old embryos . Protein concentration was estimated using the Quan - tify Protein Assay System ( Promega ) . 40 µg of proteins were mixed with SDS sample buffer and loaded on 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE . Immunoblots were probed with primary antibodies then secondary HRP - conjugated antibodies and processed for ECL following the manufacturer’s protocol ( Promega ) . DE - cadherin – specific DCad2 monoclonal antibody was used ( 1 : 50 ; Devel - opmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) ; as loading control we used a monoclo - nal antibody against Groucho ( 1 : 300 ; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) . Secondary antibodies used were anti – rat HRP and anti – mouse HRP ( 1 : 15 , 000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) . Online supplemental material Fig .
