These results demonstrated that endoA2 loca - lized to sites of STxB and CTxB internalization . Endophilins have classically been associated with the clathrin path - way ( for example , see ref . 12 ) , even if recent studies have indicated that thisviewmayneedtobebroadened 13 , 14 . Notably , theoverlapofendoA2 with fluorescent - protein - tagged clathrin or the m 2 subunit of the clath - rinadaptorAP2wasweak , bothintransientlytransfectedHeLacells , or genome - edited SK - MEL - 2 cells ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 2d , e ) . STxBalsoonlyweaklycolabelledwithclathrinpathwaymarkersinbothcellsystems ( Extended Data Fig . 2g – j ) . By contrast , endoA2 extensively codistributed with dynamin ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 2f ) , as expected 5 , 6 . InendoA2 - depletedcells , shortandapparentlytubularSTxB - containing invaginations were observed with sizes at the resolution limit of con - focal light microscopy ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . Using a nanogold con - jugate of STxB that was specifically developed for this study ( Extended Data Fig . 3b , c ) , it could be shown by electron microscopy that these structureswereconnectedtotheplasmamembrane ( Fig . 2aandExtended DataFig . 3d ) . TheirfrequencydidnotincreaseafterdepletionofendoA2 ( Fig . 2b , left ) , whereastheiraveragelengthsignificantlyincreased ( Fig . 2b , right ) . These findingswere stronglyin favour of a functionfor endoA2 inscissionofSTxB - inducedendocyticplasmamembraneinvaginations . Retrograde STxB trafficking to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) in endoA2 - depletedcellswasquantifiedusingaSTxBvariantwithtandem protein sulfation sites , termed STxB - Sulf 2 . With different siRNAs that had variable depletion efficiencies ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) , we found thatsulfationofSTxB - Sulf 2 inTGNmembraneswasinhibitedinadose - dependentmannerwithcellularendoA2levels ( Fig . 2c ) , whileSTxBcell - surface binding was not decreased ( Extended Data Fig . 4b ) . Depletion of the TGN - localized tSNARE protein syntaxin - 16 served as a bench - marktreatment 15 . WeconcludedthatendoA2wasrequiredforefficient STxBtraffickingintocells . AsimilarconclusionwasreachedwhenCTxB endocytosis was analysed in endoA2 - depleted BSC - 1 cells ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . In endoA2 - depleted cells , the inhibition of STxB transport to Golgi membranescouldalsobedocumentedbyimmunofluorescence ( Fig . 2d ) . ExpressionofsiRNA - resistantendoA2oraSH3domaindeletionmutant ( D SH3 ) rescued this phenotype ( Fig . 2d and Extended Data Fig . 4d ) , suggesting that the function of endoA2 in STxB trafficking was inde - pendentofSH3domaininteractionwithbindingpartnerssuchasdyna - min . Bycontrast , anamino - terminalamphipathichelixdeletionmutant ( endoA2 D H0 ) failed to rescue STxB trafficking ( Fig . 2d and Extended DataFig . 4d ) , probablyowingtoaroleofthishelixinmembranerecruit - ment ( seebelow ) . Correspondingly , endoA2 D SH3expressionreduced STxB - inducedtubulelengthonATP - depletedcells , similartowild - type endoA2 , whereas endoA2 D H0 failed to do so ( Extended Data Fig . 4e ) , reinforcingthehypothesisofendoA2participatinginmembranescission .

Clearly , itwasthecellularentryofSTxBandCTxBthatwasspecifically altered under these conditions . By contrast , depletion of the m 2 chain of AP2 had no effect on STxB trafficking , while transferrin uptake was efficiently blocked ( Extended Data Fig . 5d – f ) . ToaddressthefunctionofendoA2inscission , weexploitedtheknock - sideways system 18 to remove endoA2 acutely and reversibly from its normal site of action at the plasma membrane . HeLaM cells were used that expressed ( 1 ) the mitochondrial trap construct Mito - YFP - FRB ( containing a yeast mitochondrial membrane protein , the yellow fluo - rescentprotein ( YFP ) reporterandtheFKBP - rapamycin - binding ( FRB ) domain ) , and ( 2 ) endoA2 tagged with both GFP and the rapamycin - binding protein FKBP . In cells with reduced ATP levels , the length of STxB - induced tubules was only slightly increased after depletion of endogenous endoA2 ( Fig . 3a and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) , owing to the presence of the siRNA - resistant FKBP - tagged endoA2 fusion protein . The fusionprotein was then sequestered on mitochondria by theaddi - tion of rapamycin , after which the length of STxB - containing tubules b c C o r r ec t e d s u l f a t i o n l e v e l ( % o f s i C t r l ) s i C t r l 578 s i S t x 16 0 25 50 75 100 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * NS * s i E n d o A 2 - d I n v a g i n a t i o n f r e q u e n c y ( nu m b e r / μ m o f p l a s m a m e m b r a n e ) 0 . 00 . 10 . 20 . 30 . 40 . 5 0 . 60 . 70 . 8 NS siEndoA2 I n v a g i n a t i o n l e n g t h ( n m ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 * * * siEndoA2 siCtrl 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 S T x B – C y 3 s i g n a l i n G o l g i a pp a r a t u s ( a . u . ) * * * * * * NSNS s i C t r l s i E n d o A 2 + e n d o A 2 Δ H 0 + e n d o A 2 Δ S H 3 + e n d o A 2 F L siEndoA2 siCtrl siEndoA2 a siCtrl Figure 2 | EndoA2 functions in Shiga toxin uptake . a , Incubation for 5min at 37 u C of control siRNA ( siCtrl ) or endoA2 - depleted ( siEndoA2 ) HeLa cells with nanogold - coupled STxB ( arrowheads indicate invaginations ; representative images of numbers of cells as shown in b ) . b , Frequency ( siCtrl , n 5 25 cells ; siEndoA2 , n 5 27 cells ) and length ( siCtrl , n 5 149 tubules ; siEndoA2 , n 5 138 tubules ) of STxB - containing invaginations on experiments as in a .

TheseresultsstronglyreinforcedtheideathatendoA2 is involved in the scission of STxB - induced endocytic invaginations . Controlledmodelmembranesystemswerethenusedtodissectaspects ofendoA2functionwithrespecttomembranetubulationandscission . Cell - sizedliposomesthatreproducedakeyaspectofnaturalmembranes , thatis , anasymmetricbilayercomposition , wereobtainedviatheinverse emulsion technique 19 ( see Methods for leaflet compositions ) . To per - mit the acute introduction of endoA2 into the system , its topology was invertedwithrespecttothecellularsituation : whenindicated , STxBwas included inside liposomes , whereas endoA2 was added to the external medium . Incubationwithupto4 m MendoA2didnotleadtotheforma - tion of tubules ( Fig . 3b , condition 1 ) . By contrast , liposomes that con - tainedSTxBexhibitedcoiledtubularprotrusions ( condition2 ) . Addition of endoA2 to STxB - containing liposomes at concentrations of 2 or 4 m M ( Fig . 3b , conditions3or4 , respectively ) causedtubestraightening . Thus , endoA2 prompted the morphological transformation of STxB - induced tubular membranes . For dynamic measurements , we turned to another setup in which opticaltweezerswereusedtopullmembranetethersmechanicallyfrom giant unilamellarvesicles , heldwitha micropipette 20 . The force exerted by protein binding onto the tether membrane could be directly mea - sured , tube radii controlled in a range from 10 to 100 nm , and tube elongationdrivenatcontrolledvelocities . AfterendoA2injectionatcon - centrations as low as 1 m M ( protein concentration inside the injection pipette ) , the tube retraction force decreased tozero ( Fig . 3c ) , indicating the formation of an external scaffold on the tether membrane , which probablyexplainedthemorphologicaltransformationintheasymmet - ric bilayer system . WedidnotobservespontaneousscissionofendoA2 - scaffoldedtubes ( n 5 35 ) . However , when these were pulled further at elongation rates of , 0 . 5 m m s 2 1 , the tube retraction force increased ( Fig . 3d ) , leading to breakage in 15 out of 18 cases ( Fig . 3e ) . Elongation of bare tethers from fluid membranes , at rates as those used in this study , never leads to scission 19 , 21 , and we explicitly confirmed the resilience of bare tubes on forced elongation at an increased rate of , 10 m m s 2 1 ( n 5 2 ) . We speculate that interactions between endoA2 scaffold and the underly - ing membrane limit the flow of lipids during tube extension , thereby leading to increased membrane tension and spontaneous squeezing of the tube until the scission threshold radius has been reached . The pulling speed that was required in vitro to induce the scission of endoA2 - scaffolded tubes was very similar to the speed produced by microtubule - based molecular motors 22 , and microtubules have previ - ouslybeenimplicatedinthecellularentryofShigatoxin 23 . Interference withmicrotubule - basedfunctionsbeforereductionofcellularATPlevels led to the loss of micrometre - long STxB - induced tubules ( Extended Data Fig . 6b , c ) , while short ( , 200 nm ) tubules persisted ( Extended Data Fig . 7 ) . These findings suggested that STxB - induced invagina - tions were recognized by molecular motors for the further processing into cells . As indicated by a change in tube retraction force , the endoA2 D H0 mutantformedascaffoldonlyatconcentrationsabove7 m M ( Extended Data Fig . 6d ) , seven times higher than the minimum concentration requiredforwild - typeendoA2 . Furthermore , theradiusoftheendoA2H0 scaffoldwasonaveragetwicethatofthewild - typeendoA2 ( 23 6 10nm , mean 6 s . d . , n 5 10 , versus12 6 4nm , n 5 6 , respectively ) . Whenpulled , endoA2 D H0 - scaffoldedtubes neverthelessunderwentscission in5 out of 5 cases ( Extended Data Fig . 6e ) . The N - terminal amphipathic helix thus did not have a decisive role in scission by elongation of scaffolded membrane tubes . Rather , itseemed important forefficientrecruitment of endoA2 to the membrane , as well as possibly affecting the molecular organization of the scaffold . We next investigated theroleof endoA2 together withother scission factors that have been shown before to play a part in STxB uptake . The firstwasactin 10 . EndoA2andactinstronglyanddynamicallycolocalized ( Extended Data Fig . 8a ) , and even in endoA2 - depleted cells actin was localized on STxB - induced membrane invaginations ( Extended Data Fig . 8b , c ) . ThisindicatedthatendoA2wasnotrequiredforactinrecruit - ment to STxB uptake structures . Interestingly , the depletion of endoA2 or the depolymerization of actin with 0 . 5 m M latrunculin - A led to a similar increase in the length of STxB - induced tubules , and the con - comitant treatment had an additive effect ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 8d , e ) . Thus , both endoA2 and actin contributed independently to scission probability in STxB endocytosis . In cells that were depleted of ARPC2 ( p34 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ) , the length of STxB - induced tubules was similar to that observed in latrunculin - A - treated cells ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 8f ) , confirming the specificity of our observations . After depletionofdynamin , STxB - induced tubules were longer than incontrolcells 8 ( Fig . 4a ) , andendoA2wasclearlylocalizedonthesestruc - tures ( Extended Data Fig . 9a , bottom ) . Tubules positive for endoge - nous endoA2 ( ExtendedDataFig . 9b ) wereseenonlyinthe presenceof STxB ( compare 6 STxBpanels ) , inlinewithourmodelmembraneresults . This finding documented that these tubules did not preexist but were indeed induced by STxB . Dynamin was still found in association with STxBuptakestructuresinendoA2 - depletedcells ( ExtendedDataFig . 9c ) , indicatingthatinadditiontoendoA2 , otherproteinscontributetodyna - min recruitment to membranes 24 . As for actin , concomitant depletion of dynamin and endoA2 had an additive effect on the length of STxB - induced tubules ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 9d ) . Actin , dynamin and endoA2 thus independently contributed to the probabilityofscissionintheSTxBuptakepathway . Indeed , whendyna - min and endoA2 - depleted cells were concomitantly incubated with 0 . 25 m M latrunculin - A , tubule length increased further , leading to an unprecedented tubulation phenotype throughout the cell population ( Fig . 4aand Extended Data Fig . 9d ) . Importantly , whenSTxB - induced tubuleswerebinnedaccordingtotheirlength ( Fig . 4b ) , afrequencyshift was observed when going from unperturbed cells ( condition A , red ) to cells submitted to single ( condition B , yellow ) , double ( condition E , green ) or triple ( condition H , blue ) perturbation . This data represen - tation clearly illustrated that short tubules ( most abundant in unper - turbed cells ) were progressively transformed into long tubules ( most abundant in the triple - perturbation condition ) . Protein biosynthesis inhibition is an established measure of Shiga toxinarrivalinthecytosol 25 . CellsthatweredepletedofendoA2ordyna - min , or incubated with 0 . 25 m M latrunculin - A , were only weakly pro - tectedagainstShiga - liketoxin - 1 ( STx - 1 ; notethatSTx - 1andShigatoxin differbyonlyoneresidue ) ( Fig . 4candExtendedDataFig . 10a – c ) .

By contrast , triple treatment induced a substantial shift to the right of the intoxica - tion curves ( Extended Data Fig . 10d ) , such that 5 . 0 - fold ( 6 0 . 9 , n 5 4 ) more STx - 1 was required to achieve the same level of protein biosyn - thesis inhibition as in control conditions ( see quantification in Fig . 4c ) . Clearly , the scission factors endoA2 , actin and dynamin needed to be inhibited simultaneously for a substantial protection of cells against STx - 1 . OurstudyrevealsanovelfunctionofendoA2inclathrin - independent endocytosis of Shiga and cholera toxin , and suggests more generally that this BAR domain protein operates preferentially on non - clathrin sites of uptake ( see ref . 26 ) . Our data also provide strong evidence for a function of endoA2 in the scission process . In the context of the Shiga toxin model , endoA2 is , to our knowledge , the first cellular factor that was identified to recognize specifically the mechanical signal trans - mitted by the toxin to the cytosol : a highly curved plasma membrane domain . Unexpectedly , ourfindingssuggestthatactin 10 anddynamin 8 contributeinanadditivemannerwithendoA2toscissioninShigatoxinuptake . They probably act on the same endocytic invaginations and not on parallel uptake events , since the overall length of Shiga - toxin - inducedplasmamembranetubulesstronglyincreasedincellsinwhichallthreescissionfactorswereinhibited . Such additive function in scis - sion is unexpected and suggests that specificity within given endocytic processes is the result of defined cocktails of modular machinery . This hypothesis does not exclude a functional interaction between scission factors 27 , 28 . An exciting new modality emerges from our observations that scaffolding by endoA2 sensitizes tether membranes for pulling - force - induced scission . This finding should stimulate further research into the function of cytoskeleton - based molecular motors in scission and the mechanisms by which scaffolding by BAR domain proteins prime membranes to this effect .

The chamber was filled with 5 – 10 m l of the electroformation solution and 200 m l buffersolution ( 200mMglucose , 50mMNaCl , 20mMHEPES , pH7 . 4 ) . Thecham - ber was sealed with oil after , 10min to prevent evaporation . GUVs with visible fluctuationswereaspiratedinamicropipette . Membranetensionwascontrolledvia theaspirationpressure . AtetherwascreatedbybringingincontacttheGUVwitha streptavidin - coatedpolystyrenebead , approximately3 m mindiameter ( Spherotec ) , trapped with optical tweezers . Using another micropipette , endoA2 was injected in the vicinity of the GUV ( at bulk concentrations in the micropipette 0 . 3 – 5 m M per monomer for the wild type and 5 – 7 m M for the endoA2 D H0 mutant ) .

The radius of the tube was determined from the intensity of the fluorescence signal of the tube , considering that the ratio of fluorescence intensities of lipids inside the tube and inside the vesicle is proportional to the surface of the tube . To get absolute values , we used a normalization factor determined previously 44 . Image quantifications .

The quantification of STxB - inducedtubulelengthwasachievedinbatchforallimagesbysegmentingthetubular structures and skeletonizing them so that the number of pixels of tubules was proportional to their length . For this , we used a Fiji macro based on the enhance - ment of tubular structures by computing eigenvalues of the hessian matrix on a Gaussian filtered version of the image ( sigma 5 1pixel ) , as implemented in the tubenessplugin . Thetubuleswerethenthresholdedandstructurescontainingless than 3pixels were discarded . A visual check was performed and a manual correc - tionofsegmentedtubuleswasdone , ifrequired .
