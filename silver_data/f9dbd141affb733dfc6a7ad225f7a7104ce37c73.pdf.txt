How receptors recycle efﬁciently , in a sequence - dependent manner that is distinct from bulk membrane recycling , is not known . Here , in live cells , we visualize the sorting of a prototypical sequence - dependent recycling receptor , the beta - 2 adrenergic receptor , from bulk recycling proteins and the degrading delta - opioid receptor . Our results reveal a remarkable diversity in recycling routes at the level of individual endosomes , and indicate that sequence - dependent recycling is an active process mediated by distinct endosomal subdomains distinct from those mediating bulk recycling . We identify a specialized subset of tubular microdo - mains on endosomes , stabilized by a highly localized but dynamic actin machinery , that mediate this sort - ing , and provide evidence that these actin - stabilized domains provide the physical basis for a two - step kinetic and afﬁnity - based model for protein sorting into the sequence - dependent recycling pathway . INTRODUCTION Cells constantly internalize a large fraction of proteins from their surface and the extracellular environment . The fates of these internalized proteins in the endosome have a direct impact on several critical functions of the cell , including its response to environmental signals ( Lefkowitz et al . , 1998 ; Marchese et al . , 2008 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . Internalized proteins have three main fates in the endosome . First , many membrane proteins , such as the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , are sorted away from soluble proteins , largely by bulk membrane ﬂow back to the cell surface . This occurs via the formation and ﬁssion of narrow tubules that have a high ratio of membrane surface area ( and therefore membrane proteins ) to volume ( soluble contents ) ( Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . Several proteins have been implicated in the formation of these tubules ( Shinozaki - Narikawa et al . , 2006 ; Cullen , 2008 ; Traer et al . , 2007 ) , which provide a geometric basis to bulk recycling and explain how nutrient receptors can recycle leaving soluble nutrients behind to be utilized in the lysosome ( Dunn and Maxﬁeld , 1992 ; Mayor et al . , 1993 ; Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ) . Second , many membrane proteins are transported to the lysosome to be degraded . This involves a process called involution , where proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud off to the interior of the endosome and , in essence , converts these proteins into being a part of the soluble contents ( Piper and Katzmann , 2007 ) . Involution has also been studied exten - sively , and the machinery responsible , termed ESCRT complex , identiﬁed ( Hurley , 2008 ; Saksena et al . , 2007 ; Williams and Urbe´ , 2007 ) . Third , several other membrane proteins , such as many signaling receptors , escape the bulk recycling and degradation pathways , and are instead recycled in a regulated manner ( Ha - nyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2008 ; Yudowski et al . , 2009 ) . This requires a speciﬁc cis - acting sorting sequence present on the receptor’s cytoplasmic surface ( Cao et al . , 1999 ; Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2008 ) . How receptors use these sequences to escape the involution pathway and recycle , though they are excluded from the default recycling pathway ( Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ; Hanyaloglu et al . , 2005 ) , is a fundamental cell biological question that is still unanswered . Although it is clear that different recycling cargo can travel through discrete endosomal populations ( Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ) , endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling from a single endosome is generally thought to occur via a uniform population of tubules . Contrary to this traditional view , we identify special - ized endosomal tubular domains mediating sequence - depen - dent recycling that are kinetically and biochemically distinct Cell 143 , 761 – 773 , November 24 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 761 from the domains that mediate bulk recycling . These domains are stabilized by a local actin cytoskeleton that is required and sufﬁcient for receptor recycling . We propose that such special - ized actin - stabilized domains provide the physical basis for over - coming a kinetic barrier for receptor entry into endosomal tubules and for afﬁnity - based concentration of proteins in the sequence - dependent recycling pathway . RESULTS Visualization of Receptor Sorting in the Endosomes of Living Cells The beta 2 - adrenergic receptor ( B2AR ) and the delta opioid receptor ( DOR ) provide excellent models for physiologically rele - vant proteins that are sorted from each other in the endosome . Although they share endocytic pathways , B2AR is recycled efﬁ - ciently in a sequence - dependent manner while DOR is selec - tively degraded in the lysosome ( Cao et al . , 1999 ; Whistler et al . , 2002 ) . To study the endosomal sorting of these cargo molecules , we started by testing whether tubulation was involved in this process . Because such sorting has not been observed in vivo , we ﬁrst attempted to visualize the dynamics of receptor sorting in live HEK293 cells expressing ﬂuorescently labeled B2AR or DOR receptors , using high - resolution confocal microscopy . Both receptors were observed mostly on the cell surface before isoproterenol or DADLE , their respective agonists , were added . After agonist addition , both B2AR ( Figure 1A ) and DOR ( data not shown ) were robustly internalized , and appeared in endosomes within 5 min ( Figure 1A and Movie S1 available online ) . As a control , receptors did not internalize in cells not treated with agonists , but imaged for the same period of time ( Figure S1A ) . The B2AR - containing endosomes colocal - ized with the early endosome markers Rab5 ( Figure S1B ) and EEA1 ( data not shown ) , consistent with previous data . Internalized B2AR ( Figure 1B ) , but not DOR ( Figure 1C ) , also labeled tubules that extended from the main body of the receptor . When receptor ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed across multiple B2AR - containing tubules , we saw that receptors were enriched in these tubules compared to the rest of the endosomal limiting membrane ( Figure 1D ) . The bulk recycling protein TfR , in contrast , was not enriched in endosomal tubules ( Figure 1D ) . This suggests that sequence - dependent recycling receptors are enriched by an active mechanism in these endosomal tubules . These endosomal tubules were preferentially enriched for B2AR over DOR on the same endosome . In cells coexpressing FLAG - tagged B2AR and GFP - tagged DOR , we observed endo - somes that contained both receptors within 5 min after coapply - ing isoproterenol and DADLE . Notably , these endosomes extruded tubules that contained B2AR but not detectable DOR Figure 1 .

Fluorescence traces across the endosome and the tubule conﬁrmed that DOR was not detectable in these B2AR tubules , suggesting that B2AR was speciﬁcally sorted into these tubular domains ( e . g . , in Figure 1F ) . When linear pixel values from multiple sorting events were quan - tiﬁed , B2AR was enriched (cid:1) 50 % in the endosomal domains from which tubules originate , compared to the endosomal membrane outside these domains ( Figure 1G ) . Thus , these experiments resolve , for the ﬁrst time , individual events that mediate sorting of two signaling receptors in the endosomes of live cells . B2AR - Containing Endosomal Tubules Deliver Receptors to the Cell Surface To test whether these tubules mediated recycling of B2AR , we visualized direct delivery of receptors from these tubules to the cell surface . In endosomes containing internalized B2AR and DOR , these tubular domains pinched off vesicles that contained B2AR but not detectable levels of DOR ( Figure 2A and Movie S3 ) . To reliably assess if these vesicles traveled to the surface and fused with the plasma membrane , we combined our current imaging with a method that we have used previously to visualize individual vesicle fusion events mediating surface receptor delivery ( Yudowski et al . , 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , we attached the pH - sensitive GFP variant superecliptic pHluorin to the extracellular domain of B2AR ( SpH - B2AR ) ( Miesenbo¨ck et al . , 1998 ) . SpH - B2AR is highly ﬂuorescent when exposed to the neutral pH at the cell surface , but is quenched in the acidic environments of endosomes and intracellular vesicles . This allows the detection of individual fusion events of vesicles containing B2AR at the cell surface ( Yudowski et al . , 2009 ) . In cells coexpressing SpH - B2AR and B2AR labeled with a pH - insensitive ﬂuorescent dye ( Alexa - 555 ) , vesicles derived from the endosomal tubules traf - ﬁcked to the cell surface and fused , as seen by a sudden increase in SpH ﬂuorescence followed by loss of ﬂuorescence due to diffusion ( Figure 2B , and Movie S4 ) . A ﬂuorescence trace from movie S4 conﬁrmed the fusion and loss of B2AR ﬂuores - cence ( Figure 2C ) . Also , Rab4 and Rab11 , which function in endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ; Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ) , were localized to the domains containing B2AR ( Figure S1 ) . Together , this indicates that the B2AR - containing endosomal tubules mediate delivery of B2AR to the cell surface . B2AR - Containing Tubules Are Marked by a Highly Localized Actin Cytoskeleton We next examined whether the B2AR - containing microdomains were biochemically distinct from the rest of the endosomal membrane . We ﬁrst focused on actin , as the actin cytoskeleton Figure 2 .

Cell 143 , 761 – 773 , November 24 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 763 is required for efﬁcient recycling of B2AR but not of TfR ( Cao et al . , 1999 ; Gage et al . , 2005 ) , and as it has been implicated in endosome motility ( Stamnes , 2002 ; Girao et al . , 2008 ) and vesicle scission at the cell surface ( Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Perrais and Merriﬁeld , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Strikingly , in cells coexpressing B2AR and actin - GFP , actin was concentrated on the endosome speciﬁcally on the tubular domains containing B2AR ( Figure 3A ) . Virtually every B2AR tubule observed showed this speciﬁc actin concentration on the tubule ( n = 350 ) . As with actin , coronin - GFP ( Uetrecht and Bear , 2006 ) , an F - actin binding protein , also localized speciﬁcally to the B2AR - containing tubules on endosomes ( Figure 3B ) , conﬁrming that this was a polymerized actin cytoskeleton . Coronin was also observed on the B2AR - containing vesicle that was generated by dynamic scission of the B2AR tubule ( Figure 3B and Movie S5 ) .

We also used two separate techniques to characterize actin localization on these tubules beyond the (cid:1) 250 nm resolution offered by conventional microscopy . First , we ﬁrst imaged the localization of coronin on endosomes containing B2AR tubules using structured illumination microscopy ( Gustafsson et al . , 2008 ) , which resolves structures at (cid:1) 100 nm spatial resolution . 3D stacks obtained using this high - resolution technique conﬁrmed that coronin was speciﬁcally localized on the endoso - mal tubule that contained B2AR ( Figure 3D and Movie S6 ) . Second , we examined the morphology of actin on endosomal tubules at the ultrastructural level by pre - embedding immunoe - lectron microscopy . Actin was clearly labeled as ﬁlaments lying along tubules extruded from endosomal structures ( Figure 3E ) . Actin Is Dynamically Turned over on the B2AR - Containing Endosomal Tubules We then tested whether the actin ﬁlaments on these tubules were a stable structure or were dynamically turned over . When cells expressing actin - GFP were exposed to latrunculin , a drug that prevents actin polymerization , endosomal actin ﬂuores - cence became indistinguishable from the ‘‘background’’ cyto - plasmic ﬂuorescence within 16 – 18 s after drug exposure ( e . g . , in Figure 4A ) . When quantiﬁed across multiple cells , endosomal actin ﬂuorescence showed an exponential loss after latrunculin exposure , with a t 1 / 2 of 3 . 5 s ( 99 % Conﬁdence Interval = 3 . 0 to 4 . 1 s ) ( Figure 4B ) , indicating that endosomal actin turned over quite rapidly . As a control , stress ﬁbers , which are composed of relatively stable capped actin ﬁlaments , were turned over more slowly in these same cells ( e . g . , in Figure S2A ) . Endosomal actin was lost in > 98 % of cells within 30 s after latrunculin , in contrast to stress ﬁbers , which persisted for over 2 min in > 98 % of cells ( Figure S2B ) . Rapid turnover of endosomal actin was also independently conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) studies . When a single endosomal actin spot was bleached , the ﬂuorescence recovered rapidly within 20 s ( Figure 4C ) . As a control for more stable actin ﬁla - ments , stress ﬁbers showed little recovery of ﬂuorescence after bleaching in this interval ( Figure 4C ) . Exponential curve ﬁts yielding a t 1 / 2 of 8 . 26 s ( 99 % CI = 7 . 65 to 8 . 97 s ) , consistent with rapid actin turnover ( Figure 4D ) . In contrast , only part of the ﬂuorescence ( (cid:1) 30 % ) was recovered in stress ﬁbers in the same cells by 20 s , with curve ﬁts yielding a t 1 / 2 of 50 . 35 s ( 99 % CI = 46 . 05 to 55 . 54 s ) . These results indicate that actin is dynamically assembled on the B2AR recycling tubules . Considering the rapid turnover of actin , we next explored the machinery responsible for localizing actin at the tubule . The Arp2 / 3 complex is a major nucleator of dynamic actin poly - merization that has been implicated in polymerization - based en - dosome motility ( Stamnes , 2002 ; Girao et al . , 2008 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . Arp3 , an integral part of the Arp2 / 3 complex useful for visualizing this complex in intact cells ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2004 ) , was speciﬁcally concentrated at the base of the B2AR tubules on the endosome ( e . g . , in Figure 4E and ﬂuorescence trace in Figure 4F , Movie S7 ) . Every B2AR tubule observed had a corre - sponding Arp3 spot at its base ( n = 200 ) . Surprisingly , however , we did not see N - WASP and WAVE - 2 , canonical members of the two main families of Arp2 / 3 activators ( Millard et al . , 2004 ) , on the endosome ( Figure 4G ) . Similarly , we did not see endosomal recruitment of activated Cdc42 , as assessed by a previously characterized GFP - fusion reporter consisting of the GTPase binding domain of N - WASP ( Benink and Bement , 2005 ) ( data not shown ) . All three proteins were readily detected at lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia as expected , indicating that the proteins were functional in these cells . While we cannot rule out a weak or transitory interaction of these activators with Arp2 / 3 at the endosome , the lack of enrichment prompted us to test for alternate Arp2 / 3 activators . Cortactin , an Arp - and actin - binding protein present on endosomes , has been proposed to be such an activator ( Kaksonen et al . , 2000 ; Millard et al . , 2004 ; Daly , 2004 ) . Cortactin - GFP was clearly concentrated at the base of the B2AR tubule on the endosome ( Figure 4G ) , in a pattern identical to Arp2 / 3 . When quantiﬁed ( > 200 endosomes each ) , every B2AR tubule was marked by cortactin , while none of the endosomes showed detectable N - WASP , WAVE - 2 , or Cdc42 . Similarly , the WASH protein complex , which has been recently implicated in trafﬁcking from the endosome ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ) , was also clearly localized to B2AR tubules ( Figure 4G ) . Together , these data suggest that an Arp2 / 3 - , cortactin - and WASH - based machinery mediates dynamic actin assembly on the endosome . B2AR - Containing Tubules Are a Specialized Subset of Recycling Tubules on the Endosome Since the traditional view is that the endosomal tubules that mediate direct recycling to the plasma membrane are a uniform population , we next tested whether these tubules were the same as those that recycle bulk cargo . When B2AR recycling was visu - alized along with bulk recycling of TfR , endosomes containing both cargo typically extruded three to four tubules containing TfR . Strikingly , however , only one of these contained detectable amounts of B2AR ( Example in Figure 5A , quantiﬁed in Figure 5B ) . This was consistent with fast 3D confocal live cell imaging of B2AR in endosomes , which showed that most endosomes extruded only one B2AR containing tubule , with a small fraction containing two . When quantiﬁed , only 24 . 4 % of all TfR tubules contained detectable B2AR ( n = 358 tubules ) . B2AR Tubules Are a Kinetically and Biochemically Distinct from Bulk Recycling Tubules When the lifetimes of tubules were quantiﬁed , the majority ( > 80 % ) of B2AR tubules lasted more than 30 s . In contrast , the majority of TfR tubules devoid of B2AR lasted less than 30 s ( Figures 5B and 5C , Movie S8 ) . Each endosome extruded several tubules containing TfR , only a subset ( (cid:1) 30 % ) of which were marked by actin , coronin , or cortactin ( Figures 5D and 5E , arrows ) . Time - lapse movies indicated that the highly tran - sient TfR - containing tubules were extruded from endosomal domains that were lacking cortactin ( Figure 5E , arrows ) , while the relatively stable B2AR containing tubules were marked by cortactin ( Figure 5E , arrowheads ) . Importantly , the relative stability of the subset of tubules was conferred by the actin cyto - skeleton , as disruption of actin using latrunculin virtually abol - ished the stable fraction of TfR tubules ( Figures 5B and 5C ) .

Together , these results suggest that sequence - dependent recycling of B2AR is mediated by specialized tubules that are kinetically and biochemically distinct from the bulk recycling tubules containing only TfR . A Kinetic Model for Sorting of B2AR into a Subset of Endosomal Tubules The relative stability of B2AR tubules suggested a simple model , based on kinetic sorting , for how sequence - dependent cargo was sorted into a speciﬁc subset of tubules and excluded from the transient TfR - containing bulk - recycling tubules . We hypoth - esized that B2AR diffuses more slowly on the endosomal membrane relative to bulk recycling cargo . The short lifetimes of the bulk - recycling tubules would then create a kinetic barrier for B2AR entry , while this barrier would be overcome in the subset of tubules stabilized by actin . To test the key prediction of this model , that B2AR diffuses more slowly than TfR on the endosomal membrane , we directly measured the diffusion rates of B2AR and TfR using FRAP . When B2AR or TfR was bleached on a small part of the endosomal membrane , B2AR ﬂuorescence took signiﬁcantly longer to recover than TfR ( Figure 5F ) . When quantiﬁed , the rate of recovery of ﬂuorescence of B2AR ( t 1 / 2 = 25 . 77 s , 99 % CI 23 . 45 to 28 . 6 s ) was (cid:1) 4 times slower than that of TfR ( t 1 / 2 = 6 . 21 s , 99 % CI 5 . 49 to 7 . 17 s ) , indicating that B2AR diffuses signiﬁcantly slower on the endosomal membrane than TfR ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . Neither B2AR or TfR recovered within the time analyzed when the whole endosome was bleached ( Figure 5H ) , conﬁrming that the recovery of ﬂuorescence was due to diffusion from the unbleached part of the endosome and not due to delivery of new receptors via trafﬁcking . Further , B2AR on the plasma membrane diffused much faster than on the endosome ( t 1 / 2 = 6 . 45 s , 99 % CI 5 . 62 to 7 . 66 s ) , comparable to TfR , suggesting that B2AR diffusion was slower speciﬁcally on the endosome ( Figure 5H ) . We next tested whether the diffusion of B2AR into endosomal tubules was slower than that of TfR , by using the rate of increase of B2AR ﬂuorescence as an index of receptor entry into tubules . B2AR ﬂuorescence continuously increased throughout the dura - tion of the tubule lifetimes ( Figure S3A ) . Further , in a single tubule containing TfR and B2AR , TfR ﬂuorescence reached its maximum at a markedly faster rate than that of B2AR ( Fig - ure S3B ) . Together , these results suggest that slow diffusion of B2AR on the endosome and stabilization of recycling tubules by actin can provide a kinetic basis for speciﬁc sorting of sequence - dependent cargo into subsets of endosomal tubules . Local Actin Assembly Is Required for B2AR Entry into the Subset of Tubules Because actin stabilizes the B2AR - containing subset of tubules , the model predicts that endosomal actin would be required for sequence - dependent concentration of B2AR into these tubules . Consistent with this , B2AR was no longer concentrated in endo - somal tubules when endosomal actin was acutely removed using latrunculin ( e . g . , in Figure 6A ) . When the pixel ﬂuorescence along the limiting membrane of multiple endosomes was quanti - ﬁed , B2AR was distributed more uniformly along the endosomal membrane in the absence of actin ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . We further conﬁrmed this by comparing the variance in B2AR ﬂuo - rescence along the endosomal perimeter , irrespective of their orientation . B2AR ﬂuorescence was signiﬁcantly more uniform in endosomes without actin ( Figure 6D ) , indicating that actin was required for endosomes to concentrate B2AR in microdo - mains . Less than 20 % of endosomes showed B2AR - containing tubules in the absence of endosomal actin , in contrast to control cells where over 75 % of endosomes showed B2AR - containing tubules ( Figure 6E ) . Further , cytochalasin D , a barbed - end capping drug that prevents further actin polymerization but does not actively cause depolymerization , also inhibited B2AR entry into tubules ( Figure 6E ) and B2AR surface recycling ( Figure S4A ) . Neither TfR tubules on endosomes ( Figure 6E ) nor TfR recycling ( Figure S4B ) was inhibited by actin depolymer - ization , consistent with a role for actin speciﬁcally in sequence - dependent recycling of B2AR ( Cao et al . , 1999 ) . Further , deple - tion of cortactin using siRNA ( Figure 6F ) also inhibited B2AR entry into tubules ( Figures 6G and 6H ) . This inhibition was speciﬁc to cortactin depletion , as it was rescued by exogenous expression of cortactin ( Figure 6H ) . Together , these results indi - cate that a localized actin cytoskeleton concentrates sequence - dependent recycling cargo into a speciﬁc subset of recycling tubules on the endosome . B2AR Sorting into the Recycling Subdomains Is Mediated by Its C - Terminal PDZ - Interacting Domain We next asked whether this actin - dependent concentration of receptors into endosomal tubules depended on the PDZ - inter - acting sequence present in the B2AR cytoplasmic tail that medi - ates sequence - dependent recycling ( Cao et al . , 1999 ; Gage et al . , 2005 ) . To test if the sequence was required , we used a mutant B2AR ( B2AR - ala ) in which the recycling sequence was speciﬁcally disrupted by the addition of a single alanine ( Cao et al . , 1999 ) . Unlike B2AR , internalized B2AR - ala was not able to enter the tubular domains in the endosome ( e . g . , in Figure 6I , quantiﬁed in Figure 6J ) , or recycle to the cell surface ( Figure S4 ) . To test if this sequence was sufﬁcient , we used a chimeric DOR construct with the B2AR - derived recycling sequence fused to its cytoplasmic tail , termed DOR - B2 ( Gage et al . , 2005 ) , which recycles much more efﬁciently than DOR ( Figure S4 ) . In contrast to DOR , which showed little concentra - tion in endosomal tubules , DOR - B2 entered tubules ( Figures 6I and 6J ) and recycled in an actin - dependent manner similar to B2AR ( Figure S4D ) . Together , these results indicate that the ( E ) Example endosomes in live cells coexpressing B2AR and Arp3 - GFP showing Arp3 at the base of B2AR tubules ( arrowhead in the inset ) .

PDZ - interacting recycling sequence on B2AR was both required and sufﬁcient to mediate concentration of receptors in the actin - stabilized endosomal tubular domains . As PDZ - domain interactions have been established to indi - rectly link various integral membrane proteins to cortical actin ( Fehon et al . , 2010 ) , we tested whether linking DOR to actin was sufﬁcient to drive receptor entry into endosomal tubules . Remarkably , fusion of the actin - binding domain of the ERM protein ezrin ( Turunen et al . , 1994 ) to the C terminus of DOR was sufﬁcient to localize the receptor ( termed DOR - ABD ) to endosomal tubules ( Figure 6J ) . The surface recycling of B2AR , DOR - B2 , and DOR - ABD were dependent on the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton ( Figure S4 ) , consistent with previous publications ( Cao et al . , 1999 ; Gage et al . , 2005 ; Lauffer et al . , 2009 ) . Further , transplantation of the actin - binding domain was also sufﬁcient to speciﬁcally confer recycling to a version of B2AR lacking its native recycling signal ( Figure S4F ) . These results indicate that the concentration of B2AR in the actin - stabi - lized recycling tubules is mediated by linking receptors to the local actin cytoskeleton through PDZ interactions . DISCUSSION Even though endocytic receptor sorting was ﬁrst appreciated over two decades ago ( e . g . , Brown et al . , 1983 ; Farquhar , 1983 ; Steinman et al . , 1983 ) , our understanding of the principles of this process has been limited . A major reason for this has been the lack of direct assays to visualize signaling receptor sorting in the endosome . Here we directly visualized , in living cells , endo - somal sorting between two prototypic members of the largest known family of signaling receptors for which sequence - speciﬁc recycling is critical for physiological regulation of cell signaling ( Pippig et al . , 1995 ; Lefkowitz et al . , 1998 ; Xiang and Kobilka , 2003 ) . We resolve sorting at the level of single trafﬁcking events on individual endosomes , and deﬁne a kinetic and afﬁnity - based model for how sequence - dependent receptors are sorted away from bulk - recycling and degrading proteins . By analyzing individual sorting and recycling events on single endosomes , we demonstrate a remarkable diversity in recycling pathways emanating from the same organelle ( Scita and Di Fiore , 2010 ) . The traditional view has been that recycling to the plasma membrane is mediated by a uniform set of endosomal tubules from a single endosome . In contrast to this view , we demonstrate that the recycling pathway is highly specialized , and that speciﬁc cargo can segregate into specialized subsets of tubules that are biochemically , biophysically , and functionally distinct . Receptor recycling plays a critical role in controlling the rate of cellular re - sensitization to signals ( Lefkowitz et al . , 1998 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) , and recent data suggest that the sequence - dependent recycling of signaling receptors is selectively controlled by signaling pathways ( Yudowski et al . , 2009 ) . The physical separation between bulk and sequence - dependent recycling that we demonstrate here allows for such selective control without affecting the recycling of constitutively cycling nutrient receptors . Further , such physical separation might also reﬂect the differences in molecular requirements that have been observed between bulk and sequence - depen - dent recycling ( Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow , 2007 ) . Endosome - associated actin likely plays a dual role in endoso - mal sorting , both of which contribute to sequence - dependent entry of cargo selectively into special domains . First , by stabi - lizing the specialized endosomal tubules relative to the much more dynamic tubules that mediate bulk recycling , the local actin cytoskeleton could allow sequence - dependent cargo to overcome a kinetic barrier that limits their entry into the bulk pathway . Supporting this , we show that most endosomal tubules are highly transient , lasting less than a few seconds ( Figures 5B and 5C ) , which allows enough time for entry of the fast - diffusing bulk recycling cargo , but not the slow - diffusing sequence - dependent cargo ( Figures 5F and 5G ) , into these tubules . A subset of these tubules representing the sequence - dependent recycling pathway is stabilized by the presence of an actin cyto - skeleton ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . This stabilization allows time for B2AR to diffuse into these tubules ( Figure S3 ) , which eventually pinch off membranes that can directly fuse with the plasma membrane ( Figure 2 ) . Interestingly , inhibition of actin caused a decrease in the total number of tubules by approximately 25 % ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in maintaining the B2AR - containing subset of tubules , and not just in the sorting of B2AR into these tubules . Second , a local actin cytoskeleton could provide the machinery for active concentration of recycling proteins like the B2AR , which interact with actin - associated sorting proteins ( ERM and ERM - binding proteins ) through C - terminal sequences ( Weinman et al . , 2006 ; Wheeler et al . , 2007 ; Lauffer et al . , 2009 ; Fehon et al . , 2010 ) , in specialized recycling tubules . Consistent with this , the C - terminal sequence on B2AR was both required and sufﬁcient for sorting to the endosome and for recycling , and a distinct actin - binding sequence was sufﬁcient for both receptor entry intotubules and recycling ( Figure 6 andFigure S4 ) . PDZ - interacting sequences have been identiﬁed on several signaling receptors , including multiple GPCRs , with different speciﬁcities for distinct PDZ - domain proteins ( Weinman et al . , 2006 ) . Further , actin - stabilized subsets of tubules were present even in the absence of B2AR in the endosome . We propose that , using a combination of kinetic and afﬁnity - based sorting principles , discrete Actin - Stabilized SEquence - dependent Recycling Tubule ( ASSERT ) domains could thus mediate efﬁ - cient sorting of sequence - dependent recycling cargo away from both degradation and bulk recycling pathways that diverge from the same endosomes . Our results , therefore , uncover an additional role for actin poly - merization in endocytic sorting , separate from its role in endo - some motility . It will be interesting to investigate the mechanism and signals that control the nucleation of such a spatially local - ized actin cytoskeleton on the endosome .

Cortactin can act as a nucleation - promoting factor for Arp2 / 3 , at least in vitro ( Ammer and Weed , 2008 ) , and can interact with dynamin ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ; McNiven et al . , 2000 ) , which makes it an attractive candidate for coordinating actin dynamics on membranes . Interestingly , inhibition of WASH , a recently described Arp regulator that is present on B2AR tubules , has been reported to result in an increase in endo - somal tubules ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) . Although its role in sequence - dependent recycling remains to be tested , this suggests the presence of multiple actin - associated proteins with distinct functions on the endosome . The simple kinetic and afﬁnity - based principle that we propose likely provides a physical basis for sequence - depen - dent sorting of internalized membrane proteins between essen - tially opposite fates in distinct endosomal domains . Proteins that bind sequence - dependent degrading receptors and are required for their degradation ( Whistler et al . , 2002 ; Marley and von Zastrow , 2010 ) might act as scaffolds and provide a similar kinetic barrier to prevent them from accessing the rapid bulk - re - cycling tubules . Entry of these receptors into the involution pathway might then be accelerated by their association with the well - characterized ESCRT - associated domains on the vacu - olar portion of endosomes ( Hurley , 2008 ; Saksena et al . , 2007 ; Williams and Urbe´ , 2007 ) , complementary to the presently iden - tiﬁed ASSERT domains on a subset of endosomal tubules . Such diversity at the level of individual trafﬁcking events to the same destination from the same organelle raises the possibility that there exists yet further specialization among the pathways that mediate exit out of the endosome , including in the degrada - tive pathway and the retromer - based pathway to the trans - Golgi network . Importantly , the physical separation in pathways that we report here potentially allows for cargo - mediated regulation as a mode for controlling receptor recycling to the plasma membrane . Such a mechanism can provide virtually an unlimited level of selectivity in the post - endocytic system using minimal core trafﬁcking machineries , as has been observed for endocy - tosis at the cell surface ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) . As the principles of such sorting depend critically on kinetics , the high - resolution imaging used here to analyze domain kinetics and biochemistry , and to achieve single - event resolution in living cells , provides a powerful method to elucidate biologically important sorting processes in the future . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs and Reagents Receptor constructs and stably transfected HEK293 cell lines are described previously ( Gage et al . , 2005 ; Lauffer et al . , 2009 ) Transfections were per - formed using Effectene ( QIAGEN ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . For visualizing receptors , FLAG - tagged receptors were labeled with M1 anti - bodies ( Sigma ) conjugated with Alexa - 555 ( Invitrogen ) as described ( Gage et al . , 2005 ) , or fusion constructs were generated where receptors were tagged on the N - terminus with GFP . Latrunculin and Cytochalasin D ( Sigma ) were used at 10 m M ﬁnal concentration . Live - Cell and Fluorescence Imaging Cells were imaged using a Nikon TE - 2000E inverted microscope with a 100 3 1 . 49 NA TIRF objective ( Nikon ) and a Yokagawa CSU22 confocal head ( Sola - mere ) , or an Andor Revolution XD Spinning disk system on a Nikon Ti micro - scope . A 488 nm Ar laser and a 568 nm Ar / Kr laser ( Melles Griot ) , or 488 nm and 561 nm solid - state lasers ( Coherent ) were used as light sources . Cells were imaged in Opti - MEM ( GIBCO ) with 2 % serum and 30 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , maintained at 37 (cid:3) C using a temperature - controlled incubation chamber . Time lapse images were acquired with a Cascade II EM - CCD camera ( Photometrics ) driven by MicroManager ( www . micro - manager . org ) or an Andor iXon + EM - CCD camera using iQ ( Andor ) . The same lasers were used as sources for bleaching in FRAP experiments . Structured illumination microscopy was performed as described earlier ( Gustafsson et al . , 2008 ) . Electron Microscopy EM studies were carried out using MDCK cells because they are amenable to a previously described pre - embedding processing that facilitates detection of cytoplasmic actin ﬁlaments ( Ikonen et al . , 1996 ; Parton et al . , 1991 ) , and because they contain morphologically similar endosomes to HEK293 cells . Cells were grown on polycarbonate ﬁlters ( Transwell 3412 ; Costar , Cam - bridge , MA ) for 4 days as described previously ( Parton et al . , 1991 ) . To allow visualization of early endosomes and any associated ﬁlaments a pre - embed - ding approach was employed . Cells were incubated with HRP ( Sigma type II , 10mg / ml ) in the apical and basolateral medium for 10min at 37 (cid:3) C and then washed , perforated , and immunogold labeled with a rabbit anti - actin anti - body , a gift of Professor Jan de Mey ( Strasbourg ) , followed by 9nm protein A - gold . HRP visualization and epon embedding was as described previously ( Parton et al . , 1991 ; Ikonen et al . , 1996 ) . Image and Data Analysis Acquired image sequences were saved as 16 - bit tiff stacks , and quantiﬁed using ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . For estimating receptor enrichment , a circular mask 5 px in diameter was used to manually select the membrane at the base of the tubule or membranes derived from endosomes . Fluores - cence values measured were normalized to that of the endosomal membrane devoid of tubules . An area of the coverslip lacking cells was used to estimate background ﬂuorescence . For estimating linear pixel values along the tubules , aline selection wasdrawnalongthe tubule and across theendosome , and the Plot Proﬁle function used to measure pixel values . For obtaining the average valueplotacross multiplesortingevents , thelinearpixelswereﬁrstnormalized to the diameter of the endosome and then averaged . To generate pixel values along the endosomal limiting membranes , the Oval Proﬁle plugin , with 60 segments , was used after manually selecting the endosomal membrane using an oval ROI . Lifetimes of tubules were calculated by manually tracking the extension and retraction of tubules over time - lapse series . Microsoft Excel was used for simple data analyses and graphing . Curve ﬁts of data were per - formedusingGraphPadPrism . AllP - valuesarefromtwo - tailed Mann - Whitney tests unless otherwise noted .
