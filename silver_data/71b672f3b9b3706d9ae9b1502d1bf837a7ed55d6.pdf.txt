Block , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , and approved August 3 , 2012 ( received for review May 8 , 2012 ) Myosin IC ( myo1c ) , a widely expressed motor protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to cell membranes , has been associated with numerous cellular processes , including insulin - stimulated transport of GLUT4 , mechanosensation in sensory hair cells , endocytosis , transcription of DNA in the nucleus , exocytosis , and membrane trafficking . The molecular role of myo1c in these processes has not been defined , so to better understand myo1c function , we utilized ensemble kinetic and single - molecule techniques to probe myo1c ’ s biochemical and mechanical properties . Utilizing a myo1c construct containing the motor and regulatory domains , we found the force dependence of the actin - attachment lifetime to have two distinct regimes : a force - independent regime at forces < 1 pN , and a highly force - dependent regime at higher loads . In this force - dependent regime , forces that resist the working stroke increase the actin - attachment lifetime . Unexpectedly , the primary force - sensitive transition is the isomerization that follows ATP binding , not ADP release as in other slow myosins . This force - sensing behavior is unique amongst characterized myosins and clearly demonstrates mechanochemical diversity within the myosin family . Based on these results , we propose that myo1c functions as a slow transpor - ter rather than a tension - sensitive anchor . mechanochemistry ∣ optical tweezers ∣ transient kinetics M yosin IC ( myo1c ) is a widely expressed myosin - I isoform that has been associated with several important cellular processes , including endocytosis ( 1 ) , exocytosis ( 2 ) ( including in - sulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane ; refs . 3 – 5 ) , membrane ruffling ( 6 ) , transcription of DNA in the nucleus ( 7 , 8 ) , and mechanosensing in sensory hair cells ( 9 – 13 ) . Although it is known that myo1c links cell membranes to the actin cytoskeleton ( 14 , 15 ) , its molecular role in these cellular pro - cesses has not been determined . For example , in its proposed role in exocytosis , it is not known if myo1c acts as a motor for trans - port , moving vesicles into position for plasma membrane fusion and / or as a tension - sensitive anchor that docks exocytic vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane . Most members of the myosin family share the same kinetic pathway for ATP hydrolysis , in which force - generating structural changes are linked to release of inorganic phosphate and ADP , but different myosin isoforms have evolved different biochemical reaction rates and force - dependent kinetics to suit their cellular functions . For example , in myosins that are thought to act as ten - sion - sensitive anchors , the kinetic steps that limit actomyosin de - tachment are highly sensitive to load . In contrast , myosins that are thought to act as transporters have actin - detachment kinetics that are less sensitive to load , allowing work to be performed over a range of forces . Thus , insight into the molecular role of myosin in the cell can be gained from evaluating the kinetic and mechan - ical properties of the motor . Previous biochemical analyses have shown that myo1c is a low - duty ratio motor ( i . e . , it spends most of its biochemical cycle de - tached from actin ) ( 10 , 12 , 16 ) , albeit with an actin - attachment lifetime that is approximately 500 - fold longer than fast skeletal muscle myosin - II ( 17 ) and approximately 10 - fold longer than the processive motor , myosin - V ( 18 ) . The rate constants that de - fine the myo1c actin - activated ATPase pathway in solution are very similar to myo1b ( 10 , 12 , 16 , 19 ) , a closely related myo - sin - I isoform that has actin - detachment kinetics that are exqui - sitely sensitive to tension ( 20 ) . Myo1b is suited to function as a tension - sensitive anchor , transforming from a low duty - ratio motor to a high duty ratio - motor with forces resisting its working stroke > 0 . 5 pN . Moreover , the rate of actin translocation in the in vitro motility assay is similar for both myo1b ( 21 ) and myo1c ( 16 ) ( when corrected for the differences in length of the light chain – binding domain ) . Given the similarity of their unloaded biochemical properties , one may have expected myo1c to share the force - sensing properties of myo1b ( 22 , 23 ) . To better define the molecular role of myo1c in the cell , we examined the mechanical and kinetic properties of a myo1c con - struct containing the motor and regulatory domains ( myo 1 c 3 IQ ) at the ensemble level and the single - molecule level in the pre - sence and absence of force . We found that , compared to myo1b , myo 1 c 3 IQ displays a more modest change in attachment lifetime in response to force . In fact , myo 1 c 3 IQ ’ s actin - attachment lifetime is insensitive to low forces ( < 1 pN ) , but very sensitive to higher loads ( > 1 pN ) that resist the powerstroke where increasing force on the myosin increases the attachment lifetime . Furthermore , the primary force - sensitive transition in myo 1 c 3 IQ appears not to be associated with ADP release , as has been observed in many other slow myosins [ including myo1b ( 20 , 24 ) , myosin - V ( 25 ) , and smooth muscle myosin ( 26 , 27 ) ] , but rather with an isomer - ization that follows ATP binding . This force - sensing behavior is unique amongst characterized myosin isoforms . The response of myo 1 c 3 IQ to force implies that it is able to generate power over a range of loads , more consistent with its serving a role as a trans - porter than as a tension - sensitive anchor . Furthermore , these results clearly demonstrate mechanochemical diversity within the myosin - I family , possibly shedding light on the evolutionary im - peratives that resulted in the retention of eight distinct myosin - I genes in higher vertebrates . Results Actomyo1c 3IQ ATPase Ensemble Solution Kinetics . To correlate me - chanical transitions in the optical trap with biochemical transitions , rate and equilibrium constants for key steps of the actomyo 1 c 3 IQ ATPase pathway ( Scheme 1 ) were determined at 20 °C using stopped - flow kinetic techniques ( Table 1 and SI Text ) . Some of these rates have already been measured under different buffer ( 10 , 12 ) and temperature conditions ( 16 ) ; however , they were repeated here to ensure consistency between the ensemble and single - molecule experiments .

S1 A ) . The ATPase rate did not reach a plateau within the actin concentrations tested , indicating that the K ATPase ( i . e . , the concentration of actin at which half - maximal activation is achieved ) value is high ( > 150 μ M ) and the actin affinity is low ( 16 ) . The apparent rate of ATP cleavage is 33 (cid:1) 2 s − 1 ( Fig . S1 B ) . ATP binding to actomyo 1 c 3 IQ occurs in two steps ( 12 ) . A rapid collision complex with ATP ( 1 ∕ K 1 0 ¼ 97 (cid:1) 15 μ M ) is followed by a slower and effectively irreversible conformational change ( k þ 2 0 ¼ 26 (cid:1) 0 . 8 s − 1 ) that precedes rapid dissociation of myo 1 c 3 IQ from actin ( Fig . S2 ) . In the absence of nucleotide , actin - bound myo 1 c 3 IQ transits between a state that is able to bind ATP ( AM ’ ) and a state that cannot bind ATP ( AM ) ( 28 ) . The equilibrium constant for this transition favors the ATP - insensitive ( AM ) state ( K α ¼ 0 . 33 (cid:1) 0 . 03 ) ( Table 1 ) . The rate of the transi - tion from AM to AM ’ ( k þ α ¼ 4 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 03 s − 1 ) is similar to the rate of ADP release from actomyo 1 c 3 IQ ( k þ 5 0 ¼ 3 . 9 (cid:1) 0 . 06 s − 1 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . Actomyo 1 c 3 IQ has a high affinity for ADP ( K 5 0 ¼ 0 . 22 (cid:1) 0 . 05 μ M ) . The affinity of myo 1 c 3 IQ for actin in the ab - sence of nucleotide is tight ( K 6 ¼ 0 . 29 nM ) , and it is weakened by the addition of ADP ( K 10 ¼ 1 . 6 nM ) ( Fig . S3 ) . The ratio of affinities ( K 10 ∕ K 6 ¼ K DA ∕ K A ) has been termed the coupling constant ( 22 , 23 ) , and the calculated value of 5 . 5 is similar to previously published values for myo1b ( 28 , 29 ) ; however , it is larger than a previously reported value for myo1c ( 10 ) . Based on the solution kinetics , ADP release is expected to be rate limit - ing for actomyosin detachment at saturating ATP concentrations ; however , a slower transition ( likely associated with phosphate release ) ( 16 , 19 ) limits the rate of the overall ATPase cycle . The effective duty ratio of myo 1 c 3 IQ at 100 μ M actin and saturating ATP concentrations is 0 . 11 . ADP Release Limits Actomyo1c 3IQ Detachment at Low Forces in the Optical Trap . Single actomyosin interactions were detected using the three - bead assay , in which a single actin filament , suspended between two beads held by separate optical traps , is brought close to the surface of a pedestal bead that is sparsely coated with myo 1 c 3 IQ ( 20 , 30 , 31 ) . Myo 1 c 3 IQ was attached specifically to streptavidin - coated pedestals by a biotinylation tag positioned directly C - terminal to the light chain – binding domain . Bead – actin – bead assemblies were constructed using a unique actin - attachment strategy . We could not use N - ethylmaleimide modi - fied myosin for these assemblies as we had done previously ( 20 , 30 ) because N - ethylmaleimide – treated myosin retains some ATP sensitivity that becomes problematic at the high ATP con - centrations used in the experiments described below . Further - more , we could not use a biotin – streptavidin linkage because this interferes with the biotin – streptavidin linkage used to attach the myosin site - specifically to the pedestal bead . Instead , we utilized the actin - binding domain of α - actinin fused to the HaloTag gene product , enabling the experiments to be conducted at saturating ATP concentrations while still utilizing streptavidin to attach the myosin specifically to the pedestal bead ( for details , see Materials and Methods ) . Actomyosin - attachment events ( Fig . 1 A ) were identified by analyzing the force covariance of the trapped beads ( 20 ) ( for details , see Materials and Methods ) . Actomyo 1 c 3 IQ - attachment durations were first determined at low trap stiffness ( approximately 0 . 02 pN ∕ nm ) to minimize the force on actomyo 1 c 3 IQ during the working stroke . The distri - bution of attachment durations acquired in the presence of 5 mM ATP could be well fit by a single exponential function ( Fig . 1 B ) , yielding an actin - detachment rate ( k det ¼ 3 . 6 (cid:1) 0 . 2 s − 1 ) that is Scheme 1 .

The myo1c working stroke has been shown to be composed of two substeps ( 12 ) . We determined the substep sizes and kinetics in the presence of 5 mM ATP by ensemble averaging the time courses of individual actomyo 1 c 3 IQ interactions that were synchronized at the time when the interactions started ( i . e . , upon actomyosin at - tachment ) or ended ( i . e . , upon actomyosin detachment ) ( 20 , 24 , 32 ) . Ensemble averages that were synchronized at actomyosin at - tachment were averaged forwards in time ( time - forward averages ) whereas the interactions that were synchronized at actomyosin detachment were averaged backwards in time ( time - reverse averages ) . Time - forward averages have a rapid initial substep to state 1 ( 5 . 8 nm displacement ) followed by a slower increase to state 2 , which has a final displacement of 7 . 8 nm ( Fig . 1 C and Table 2 ) . The total step sizes measured from both the time - forward and time - reverse averages differ by only 5 . 6 % , with the small difference arising from limitations in selecting extension points for ensemble averaging . The distribution of individual myo 1 c 3 IQ displacements is well described by a single Gaussian distribution centered at 7 . 8 nm ( Fig . 1 D ) , agreeing with the ensemble averages . The rate of exit from state 1 was determined by fitting the time course of the time - forward average ( Fig . 1 C ) with a single expo - nential function ( k forward ¼ 4 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 1 s − 1 ) . This rate is similar to the measured ADP - release rate ( k þ 5 0 ¼ 3 . 9 (cid:1) 0 . 06 s − 1 ) , and it is consistent with the second substep of the working stroke being associated with ADP release as shown previously for myo1c ( 12 ) and other myosins ( 20 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 33 ) . The rate of exit from state 2 was determined by fitting the time course of the time - re - verse average by exponential functions . We found that the data were best fit by the sum of two exponentials , with the major com - ponent having a faster rate ( k reverse - fast ¼ 27 (cid:1) 3 s − 1 ; 67 (cid:1) 4 % of the total amplitude ) than the minor component ( k reverse - slow ¼ 3 . 8 (cid:1) 0 . 2 s − 1 ) . The k reverse - fast rate is similar to the rate of the bio - chemical step that limits actomyo 1 c 3 IQ detachment from state 2 ( k þ 2 0 ¼ 26 (cid:1) 0 . 8 s − 1 ; Scheme 1 and Table 1 ) . Force Dependence of Actomyo1c 3IQ Detachment . The force sensitiv - ity of the rate of myo 1 c 3 IQ detachment from actin was measured using a feedback system that keeps the actin near its isometric position while myosin undergoes its working stroke ( 20 , 30 , 34 , 35 ) . Forces applied to the actomyo 1 c 3 IQ are determined by the stiffness of the actomyo 1 c 3 IQ ( and its linkage to the substrate ) , the position at which myosin binds to the actin filament ( which is stochastic ) ( 36 ) , and the size of the working stroke ( Materials and Methods ) . At forces less than 1 pN , the durations of actin attachments appear to be force - independent ( Fig . 2 A ) . Only at forces that ex - ceed 1 pN does there appear to be an increase in the mean dura - tion of attachments . The force dependence of the duration of actin binding is better visualized by plotting the inverse average of attachment durations binned by force ( Fig . 2 B ) to yield detach - ment rates ( k det ) . At low forces ( < 1 pN ) , k det is independent of force , whereas at forces > 1 pN , there is a transition to force - sen - sitive detachment where k det slows with increasing force . Force independence of detachment at forces < 1 pN was verified by comparing the distribution of attachment durations between − 1 and 0 pN to those between 0 and 1 pN using a two - sample Kolmogorov – Smirnov test ( 37 ) , which showed no statistical dif - ference between these conditions ( P ¼ 0 . 99 ) . The force independence of actomyosin detachment at forces < 1 pN can be further tested utilizing the Bell equation ( 38 ) , which describes the force dependence of a mechanochemical transition by : k f ð F Þ ¼ k f 0 · e − F · d kB · T ; [ 1 ] where k f 0 is the rate in the absence of load , d is the distance to the transition state ( a measure of force sensitivity , also known as the distance parameter ) , k B is Boltzmann ' s constant , and T is the temperature . Fitting the Bell equation to the data at forces < 0 . 5 pN yields a very small distance parameter for this limited dataset ( d 0 . 5 pN ¼ 0 . 12 (cid:1) 0 . 49 nm ) , reinforcing the force inde - pendence of actomyosin detachment at low forces . We modeled the observed detachment rate for the entire range of forces as two sequential steps , one force - independent ( k i ) and one force - dependent [ k f ð F Þ ] : A → k i B → k f ð F Þ C or A → k f ð F Þ B → k i C [ 2 ] This modeling alone cannot distinguish the order of the steps because the two models in Eq . 2 have the same force dependence of the actomyosin - detachment rate , and thus the probability den - sity functions used for maximum - likelihood estimation are identi - cal . The force - dependent rate was modeled using the Bell equation ( Eq . 1 ) , and thus the detachment rate ( k det ) is given by : 1 k det ð F Þ ¼ 1 k i þ 1 k f ð F Þ ¼ 1 k i þ 1 k f 0 · e − F · d det kB · T [ 3 ] Maximum - likelihood estimation was used to fit the model to distribution of attachment durations ( Fig . 2 A ) , and bootstrapping was used to determine confidence limits ( 20 ) . We determined va - lues for the force - independent rate [ k i ¼ 5 . 6 ðþ 1 . 6 ∕ − 0 . 8 Þ s − 1 ] , the force - dependent rate in the absence of force [ k f 0 ¼ 29 ðþ 9 ∕ − 6 Þ s − 1 ] , and the distance parameter for detachment [ d det ¼ 5 . 2 ðþ 0 . 5 ∕ − 0 . 6 Þ nm ] . The rate k i is similar to the acto - myosin - detachment rate determined in the absence of force ( k det ¼ 3 . 6 s − 1 ; Fig . 1 B ) , the rate of the exponential increase Table 2 .

Surpris - ingly , the force - dependent rate in the absence of force , k f 0 , is similar to the rate of the fast exponential increase resolved in the time - reverse average ( k reverse - fast ¼ 27 (cid:1) 3 s − 1 ; Fig . 1 C ) and the rate of the biochemical step that limits actomyo 1 c 3 IQ detach - ment from state 2 ( k þ 2 0 ¼ 26 (cid:1) 0 . 8 s − 1 ; Scheme 1 and Table 1 ) . Note that decreasing the width of the smoothing window in the data analysis to allow for detection of events as short as 15 ms did not change these values ( Fig . S4 ) . Thus , the primary force - sen - sitive transition in myo 1 c 3 IQ is not ADP release , as it is in many other slow myosins ; rather , the step that follows ATP binding is force sensitive and limits the rate of detachment at high forces ( see below ) . The rate at which the feedback loop applies force to keep the actin near its isometric position is set by the response time of the feedback loop , 50 ms ( 20 ) . To determine if the actomyo 1 c 3 IQ - at - tachment durations were sensitive to the rate of the feedback re - sponse , we acquired interactions with an approximately 10 - fold faster feedback – response time ( 5 – 7 ms ; Table 2 and Fig . S4 ) and found no change in the force dependence of the actomyosin - detachment rate . The Force - Dependent Transition Occurs After ADP Release . Because the rate of the biochemical step that limits actomyo 1 c 3 IQ detach - ment from state 2 appears to be the primary force - sensitive tran - sition , we examined the force dependence of the lifetime of state 2 using the isometric optical clamp . Individual attachment events were binned based on the average interaction force and then time - reverse ensemble averages were constructed as described earlier . Fitting single exponential functions to the time - reverse ensemble averages shows that the lifetime of state 2 is strongly force - dependent ( Fig . 2 C ) . At forces below 1 pN , the rate of exit from state 2 is faster than the rate of actomyo 1 c 3 IQ detachment , but at forces > 1 pN , the rate of exit from state 2 is equal to the force - dependent detachment rate ( Fig . 2 B ) . Fitting the Bell equa - tion ( Eq . 1 ) to the rates from the loaded time - reverse ensemble averages ( Fig . 2 B , dashed line ) yields a rate at zero force ( k f 0 - ensavg ) of 26 (cid:1) 2 s − 1 , which is similar to the rate of the fast - exponential increase in the time - reverse averages in the absence of load ( k reverse - fast ¼ 27 (cid:1) 3 s − 1 ; Fig . 1 C ) and the rate of the biochemical transition that limits actomyo 1 c 3 IQ detachment from state 2 ( k þ 2 0 ¼ 26 (cid:1) 0 . 8 s − 1 ; Scheme 1 and Table 1 ) . Further - more , the distance to the transition state ( d ensavg ) of this step is 4 . 6 (cid:1) 0 . 8 nm , similar to the distance parameter of the transition that limits overall actomyosin detachment [ d det ¼ 5 . 2 ðþ 0 . 5 ∕ − 0 . 6 Þ nm ] . Thus , the force - dependent transition that limits de - tachment at loads greater than 1 pN occurs after the second step of the working stroke and before detachment . Added ADP Has Little Effect on the Force Dependence of Actomyo1c 3IQ Detachment . The force - dependent behavior of some myosins has been shown to be highly sensitive to the presence of ADP ( 39 , 40 ) . Therefore , we performed experiments with the isometric op - tical clamp engaged in the presence of 50 μ M ADP and 1 mM ATP ( Fig . 3 ) . These conditions resulted in force - dependent de - tachment rates similar to those acquired in the presence of 5 mM ATP . Fitting the attachment durations as a function of force ( Fig . 3 A ) by Eq . 3 yields values that are equivalent to the 5 mM ATP data ( Fig . 2 A and Table 2 ) . Thus , the presence of ADP does not substantially affect the load - dependent kinetics of myo 1 c 3 IQ . We also performed experiments using the isometric optical clamp with 1 mM FPLC - purified ATP to decrease ADP contamination to < 1 % of the ATP concentration ( see Materials and Methods ) . We observed the same biphasic force response , and the parameters ob - tained from fitting Eq . 3 to the data are similar to the values ob - tained using 5 mM non – FPLC purified ATP ( Table 2 and Fig . S4 ) . Discussion To better understand the molecular role of myo1c in the cell , we utilized ensemble and single - molecule techniques to characterize the mechanochemical cycle of myo 1 c 3 IQ . Utilizing a novel bead – actin – bead attachment strategy to maintain high actin pretension in the presence of 5 mM ATP , we found that the actin - attachment lifetime of myo 1 c 3 IQ increases only with forces > 1 pN and that it B 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 k de t ( s - 1 ) Force ( pN ) 0 . 1 1 10 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 A tt a c h m en t D u r a t i on ( s ) Force ( pN ) C A - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 F o r c e ( p N ) Time ( s ) Resisting Assisting Fig . 2 .

Furthermore , the primary force - sensitive transition in myo 1 c 3 IQ is not ADP release [ as has been seen in other slow myosins ( 25 , 27 ) , including myo1b ( 20 ) ] , but is rather the isomerization following ATP binding ( see below ) . These re - sults help to shed light on the molecular role of myo1c in the cell and highlight the diversity of mechanochemical tuning within the myosin superfamily . The Myo1c 3IQ Working Stroke . We resolved two actin - bound me - chanical states populated during the myo 1 c 3 IQ working stroke ( Fig . 1 C ) , as described previously ( 12 ) . State 1 has a displacement of 5 . 8 nm and a lifetime equivalent to the AM . ADP biochemical state ( Scheme 1 and Tables 1 and 2 ) . Thus , exit from state 1 is associated with the release of ADP from actomyo 1 c 3 IQ ( k þ 5 0 ) . Furthermore , this transition limits the overall actin - detachment rate at low loads and saturating ATP concentrations . State 2 has a displacement of 7 . 8 nm ( 2 . 0 nm larger than state 1 ) . At subsaturating ATP concentrations , the rate of exit from state 2 has been shown to correlate with the second - order rate constant for ATP binding in other myosins ( 20 , 24 , 27 ) . Thus , at low ATP concentrations where ATP binding is rate - limiting , state 2 is populated by the nucleotide - free AM ’ biochemical state . Our experiments were performed at a saturating ATP concentration ( 5 mM ) , and so , based on the transient - kinetics experiments , exit from state 2 is expected to be limited by the rate of k þ 2 0 , the iso - merization following ATP binding ( Fig . 1 C and Scheme 1 ) . This conclusion is supported by the finding that the predominant com - ponent of the time - reverse averages has a rate ( k reverse - fast ¼ 27 (cid:1) 3 s − 1 ) similar to the rate of the biochemical transition that limits actomyosin detachment from state 2 ( k þ 2 0 ¼ 26 (cid:1) 0 . 8 s − 1 ; Table 1 ) . Thus , AM ( ATP ) is the predominant biochemical inter - mediate of state 2 under our experimental conditions ( Scheme 1 ) . Probing the myosin mechanics at saturating ATP concentrations was facilitated by the development of a unique bead – actin – bead attachment strategy ( see Materials and Methods ) . The origin of the minor slow phase ( k reverse - slow ¼ 3 . 8 (cid:1) 0 . 2 s − 1 ) in the time - reverse average ( Fig . 1 C ) is unclear . This slow rate is similar to the rate of ADP release ( 3 . 9 (cid:1) 0 . 06 s − 1 ) , so it is pos - sible that this component arises from rotation of the lever arm and population of state 2 before ADP release occurs ( 33 % of the time ) , consistent with the finding that nucleotide and struc - tural states are not necessarily tightly coupled ( 41 ) . This rate is also similar to the rate of exit from the ATP - insensitive AM state ( k þ α ¼ 4 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 03 s − 1 ; Table 1 ) . However , the agreement of the biochemical kinetics ( Table 1 ) with the actin - attachment lifetimes ( Fig . 1 B and Table 2 ) suggests that the nucleotide - insensitive state ( AM ; Scheme 1 ) is not substantially populated in the presence of 5 mM ATP . It is worth noting that this slow phase is not resolved in the traces collected with the isometric optical clamp engaged , likely because of noise and the fact that it becomes obscured by the slowing of the fast rate with force ( see below ) . Further studies are necessary to determine the origin of this slow phase . Myo1c 3IQ Force - Dependent Detachment . The rate at which myo 1 c 3 IQ detaches from actin is largely independent of load at forces < 1 pN , but is force - dependent at higher loads ( Fig . 2 ) . If we assume a sequential three - state model with a force - sensitive step that follows the Bell model ( Eq . 3 ) ( 38 ) , we conclude that the rate of the force - sensitive transition is faster than the transition that limits detachment at low loads , yet it becomes rate - limiting for detachment when the force on the myosin exceeds 1 pN . Be - cause ADP release limits the overall actomyosin - detachment rate in the absence of force , ADP release is not the primary force - de - pendent transition as it is in some other myosins ( 20 , 24 , 25 , 27 ) . This result is notable , because ADP release is associated with a mechanical step of 2 . 0 nm ( Fig . 1 ) . In fact , fitting Eq . 1 to the data acquired at forces < 0 . 5 pN ( i . e . , where the rate of ADP release limits actomyosin detachment ) yields a very small distance para - meter ( d 0 . 5 pN ¼ 0 . 12 (cid:1) 0 . 49 nm ) , which is far smaller than the size of the second mechanical step . Because the distance para - meter for this transition is small , the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate must be closer to the AM . ADP state than the AM state ( 42 ) . This feature contrasts with other characterized myosins , where the size of the distance parameter is similar to the size of the mechanical step ( 27 , 33 ) , suggesting the position of the transition state is closer to the AM state in these myosins . A fit of Eq . 3 to the attachment durations indicates that the force - dependent rate in the absence of force ( k f 0 ¼ 29 s − 1 ) is si - milar to the rate of the biochemical step that follows ATP binding ( k þ 2 0 ¼ 26 (cid:1) 0 . 8 s 1 ; Scheme 1 and Table 1 ) and the rate of the time - reverse ensemble average in the absence of applied force ( k reverse - fast ¼ 27 s − 1 ) . Fitting Eq . 1 to the force dependence of the rates of the time - reverse ensemble averages in the presence of load yields a similar rate for the force - sensitive transition in the absence of force ( k f 0 - ensavg ¼ 26 s − 1 ) with a distance parameter ( d ensavg ¼ 4 . 6 nm ) that is similar to the distance parameter for the transition that limits force - dependent detachment at forces > 1 pN ( d det ¼ 5 . 2 nm ) . It is unlikely that the formation of the AM ( ATP ) collision complex ( K 1 0 ) is the primary force - depen - dent step because this would result in a decrease in the second - order rate constant for ATP binding , which would decrease k f 0 at lower ATP concentrations ( Eq . 3 ) . However , experiments per - formed at 1 mM ATP ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S4 ) and 5 mM ATP ( Fig . 2 B ) show the same relationship between the detachment rate and force ( Table 2 ) . Therefore , our data support the primary force - dependent transition as the isomerization between ATP binding and actomyosin detachment ( k þ 2 0 ) ( Fig . 4 A ) .

Force sensitivity of myo 1 c 3 IQ in the presence of ADP . The isometric optical clamp was used to examine the force sensitivity of myo 1 c 3 IQ at 50 μ M ADP and 1 mM ATP ( n ¼ 282 ) . ( A ) Scatter plot of individual single - molecule attachment durations as a function of force . The overall detachment rate as a function of force was modeled as the sum of two rates , one force - depen - dent and one force - independent ( Eq . 3 ) . The best - fit parameters were calcu - lated using MLE fitting and the 90 % confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping . The force - independent rate ( k i ) is equal to 4 . 0 ð − 0 . 5 Þ s − 1 . The force - dependent rate ( k f 0 ) is equal to 25 ðþ 5 ∕ − 2 Þ s − 1 with a distance para - meter ( d det ) of 6 . 3 ðþ 0 . 6 ∕ − 0 . 5 Þ nm . ( B ) For the sake of visualization , the de - tachment rates ( the reciprocal of the attachment durations ) were binned by force and averaged . The thick black line shows the best - fit curve and the grey - shaded regions show the 90 % confidence intervals . All MLE fitting and bootstrapping was performed on the unaveraged data ( Fig . 3 A ) . Greenberg et al . PNAS ∣ Published online August 20 , 2012 ∣ E2437 B I O P H Y S I C S A ND C O M P U T A T I O N A L B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S note that other transitions may be force - sensitive ; however , these force sensitivities are likely of secondary importance because they do not limit detachment under load . Interestingly , the distance parameters for ATP binding and the subsequent isomerization in myosin - V ( 25 ) ( d ¼ 0 . 9 nm ) , smooth muscle myosin - II ( 27 ) ( d ¼ 1 . 3 nm ) , and myo1b ( 20 ) ( d ¼ 2 . 5 nm ) are much smaller that the distance parameter for the iso - merization following ATP binding in myo 1 c 3 IQ ( 5 . 2 nm ) . How the size of this distance parameter is related to conformational changes in the nucleotide and actin - binding sites requires further investigation . At low ATP concentrations ( ≤ 20 μ M ) , the actomyosin - detach - ment rate at low forces is limited by the apparent second - order rate constant for ATP binding ( K 1 0 k þ 2 0 ) and not ADP release . Because the force - independent regime at high [ ATP ] occurs over the range of forces where the rate of ADP release is slower than ATP binding , a force - independent regime at forces < 1 pN would not be observed at low [ ATP ] , and the actin - detachment rate would appear to be sensitive to all forces > − 1 pN . This finding may explain a previous report of myo1c force dependence con - ducted at 20 μ M ATP , which suggested that kinetics of actomyo1c detachment were sensitive over the range of all of the forces ex - amined ( - 1 to + 1 pN ) ( 43 ) . Our results reinforce the importance of performing experiments at saturating ATP concentrations be - cause different force - dependent transitions may be observed at subsaturating ATP concentrations ( 44 ) . It is worth pointing out that the myo 1 c 3 IQ construct examined in these studies contained the motor and regulatory domains . Future studies utilizing the full - length myo1c molecule will show whether the tail domain plays a role in modulating myo1c mechanochemistry . Relationship to Other Myosins . ADP release is the primary force - sensitive transition for several characterized myosins ( 20 , 24 , 25 , 27 ) . For example , myo1b is a closely related myosin - I isoform with ATPase kinetics similar to myo1c , but the primary force - dependent transition is associated with ADP release ( 20 ) . More - over , the myo1b - attachment lifetime is extremely sensitive to applied loads ( 20 , 30 ) . The distance parameter for myo 1 b a ( a myo1b splice isoform with six IQ motifs ) is 18 nm , more than threefold greater than the distance parameter for myo 1 c 3 IQ ( 30 ) . This dramatic force sensitivity enables myo1b to function as a tension - sensitive anchor , changing from a low - to a high - duty ratio motor with forces of < 2 pN . Although it has been proposed that myo1c also acts as a tension sensor ( 10 , 12 , 45 ) , the data pre - sented here show that myo 1 c 3 IQ is substantially less force - sensi - tive than myo1b ( Fig . 2 B ) . The structural basis for these differences is unclear without high - resolution information . It is worth noting that ATP binding has been proposed to be the primary force - sensitive transition in myosin - VI ( 46 ) , although this mechanism is still debated ( 39 , 47 , 48 ) . The force - dependent ATP - binding model proposes that myosin - VI ’ s primary force - de - pendent transition is ATP binding ( 46 ) and not the isomerization following ATP binding as seen here for myo 1 c 3 IQ . Moreover , the force sensitivity of myo 1 c 3 IQ is different from myosin - VI in that it has been shown that the addition of ADP causes an increase in the force sensitivity of myosin - VI ( 39 , 47 , 49 ) , whereas ADP has no appreciable effect on the force sensitivity of myo 1 c 3 IQ ( Fig . 3 ) . The basis for these differences between myo 1 c 3 IQ and myosin - VI is not clear ; however , the force - sensing mechanism of myo 1 c 3 IQ appears to be unique amongst all myosins that have been me - chanochemically characterized . It has been suggested that the ADP coupling constant ( i . e . , the ratio of the dissociation constant of actomyosin in the pre - sence of ADP to the dissociation constant in the absence of ADP , K DA ∕ K A ) is an indicator for whether a myosin is a tension sensor or a fast mover . A coupling constant of < 10 is viewed as a sig - nature for a tension sensor ( 22 , 23 ) , and myo 1 c 3 IQ has a coupling constant of 5 . 5 , placing it in the tension - sensor class . Myo 1 c 3 IQ ( 10 ) and myo1b ( 28 , 29 ) have similar coupling constants and kinetic rate constants , and thus one would expect them to have similar mechanics and functions ; however , this is clearly not the case ( Figs . 3 and 4 B and C ) . Furthermore , myo1b and myo 1 c 3 IQ have different kinetic steps as their primary force - sensitive tran - sitions , something not apparent from an analysis of the solution kinetics alone . Previous assignments of the molecular roles of other myosins based solely on kinetics should thus be revisited using mechanical measurements . The Molecular Role of Myo1c . The potential molecular roles for myo1c can be broadly divided into two categories with distinct kinetic and mechanical properties : transporter and tension - sen - sitive anchor . A transporter , such as myosin - V , needs to be able to generate productive work in the presence of a load , and as such , its power output needs to be high and sustained over a range of forces . On the other hand , a tension - sensitive anchor , such as myo1b , needs to be able to remain attached to actin in the pre - sence of load ( i . e . , its attachment duration is very force - sensitive ) , and as such , its power output should be low and sensitive to load . The force sensitivity of myo 1 c 3 IQ ( Figs . 2 B and 4 B ) and its power output over a range of forces ( Fig . 4 C ) are more consistent with myo1c acting as transporter , albeit a slow one , rather than as a tension - sensitive anchor . The slower kinetics of myo1c may allow for the transport of cargos through highly cross - linked actin meshworks without compromising their integrity because the dissociation rate of cytoskeletal cross - linkers are similar to k det ( 50 , 51 ) . In contrast , cargo transport by myosins with faster step - ping kinetics , such as myosin - V , would require disassembly of the actin network because the motor ’ s stepping rate is faster than the dissociation rate of cytoskeletal cross - linkers .

Comparison of myo 1 c 3 IQ and the closely related isoform , myo1b ( splice isoform “ a ” ) . ( A ) Model of myo1c ( blue ) interacting with actin ( red ) in the presence of force . The transition corresponding to ADP release [ the primary force - sensitive transition in myo1b ( 20 ) , smooth muscle myosin - II ( 27 ) , and myosin - V ( 25 ) ] is force - insensitive for myo 1 c 3 IQ and rate - limiting for actomyosin detachment at forces less than 1 pN . At forces in excess of 1 pN , the primary force - sensitive transition ( the isomerization that follows ATP binding ) becomes rate - limiting for detachment . ( B ) The duty ratios of myo 1 c 3 IQ ( blue ) and myo1b ( red ) , calculated from the transient - kinetics and optical - trapping experiments ( 20 ) , show that the duty ratio of myo 1 c 3 IQ is substantially less force - sensitive than myo1b . ( C ) The calculated average power output ( see Materials and Methods ) of myo 1 c 3 IQ ( blue ) , myo1b ( red ) ( 20 ) , smooth muscle myosin - II ( purple ) ( 27 ) , and myosin - V ( Inset ) ( 18 , 25 ) as a function of force . Note that myo 1 c 3 IQ is substantially different from myo1b . Myo1b has a very low power output that approaches zero with very little force , consistent with myo1b acting as a tension - sensitive anchor . Myo 1 c 3 IQ , on the other hand , has a higher power output and is able to gen - erate power over a range of forces , more consistent with its functioning as a transporter rather than as a tension - sensing anchor . The power output of myo 1 c 3 IQ is lower than smooth muscle myosin - II or myosin - V because of its slower overall kinetics ; however , all three of these myosins are able to gen - erate power over a range of forces . E2438 ∣ www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1207811109 Greenberg et al . power output of myo 1 c 3 IQ is less than that of smooth muscle myo - sin - II and myosin - V because of its slower biochemical kinetics ; however , all three myosins are similar in that they are able to gen - erate power over a range of forces , enabling them to accomplish work . It is interesting to note that , unlike myosin - VI ( 39 ) , the force - sensing behavior of myo 1 c 3 IQ is not highly ADP - sensitive , potentially enabling myo1c to generate power without stalling at cellular concentrations of ADP . Myo1c has been proposed to be the slow adaptation motor in sensory hair cells where it senses changes in the tension of the tip link ( 9 – 13 , 45 ) . If this is myo1c ’ s role , then models need to incor - porate the motor ’ s unique tension - sensing properties . New mod - els of adaptation may require myo1c to work in ensembles to maintain a dynamic stall where ATP would be continuously hy - drolyzed to maintain tension , rather than acting as a myo1b - like tension - sensitive anchor . One of the assumptions of the current model of adaptation is that calcium will cause a decrease in the force sensitivity of the adaptation motor , leading the myosin to detach from actin . Although our experiments have not examined the effect of calcium on myo1c , our previous experiments with myo1b showed that the distance parameter is proportional to the size of the working stroke ( 30 ) and that calcium causes a reduction in both ( 52 ) . In contrast , it has been suggested that calcium increases the size of the myo1c working stroke ( 12 ) , and thus one would potentially expect calcium to increase the force sensitivity , leading to prolonged attachment . Future studies are warranted to examine the effect of calcium on myo1c mechano - chemistry at saturating ATP concentrations . Materials and Methods Reagents and Buffers . ADP and ATP concentrations were determined before each transient - kinetic experiment by absorbance ( ε 259 ¼ 15 ; 400 M − 1 cm − 1 ) . The purity of ATP and ADP was assessed by running a 0 – 1 M salt gradient over a FPLC MonoQ column with bound ATP or ADP . No differences in myo - sin - loadedor - unloadedkineticsintheopticaltrapwereobservedusingFPLC - purifiedATP , andthus , unless otherwisenoted , non – FPLCpurified ( 99 % pure ) ATP was used . Unless stated otherwise , all experiments were performed in KMg25 buffer ( 10 mM MOPS , 25 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM DTT ) . ATP was always added as MgATP ( e . g . , solutions containing 5 mM ATP contained 6 mM total MgCl 2 ) . All transient - kinetics experiments were conducted in the presence of 1 μ M free calmodulin ( i . e . , in excess of the calmodulin already bound to the myosin from the purification ) , and all optical - trapping experiments were conducted in the presence of at least 2 μ M free calmodulin . Apyrase VII was obtained from Sigma . Protein Preparation . The mouse myo1c construct used in these studies consisted of the motor domain , complete regulatory domain with three IQ motifs , a C - terminal FLAG tag for affinity purification , and a C - terminal AviTag for site - specific biotinylation ( 16 ) . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described ( 53 ) . Actin concentrations were determined by absorbance at 290 nm ( ε 290 ¼ 26 ; 600 M − 1 cm − 1 ) . Calmodulin was pre - pared as described ( 54 ) . For single - molecule experiments , actin was polymer - ized and fluorescently labeled in the presence of 1 ∶ 1 molar equivalent TRITC phalloidin ( Sigma ) . For transient - kinetics experiments utilizing N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide – labeled actin ( pyrene actin ) , the actin was labeled , gel fil - tered ( 55 ) , and stabilized with a 1 ∶ 1 molar ratio of unlabeled phalloidin . HaloTag α - Actinin – Coated Beads . Single - molecule optical - trapping experi - ments conducted at saturating ATP require an ATP - insensitive linkage that does not interfere or compete with the biotin – streptavidin linkage used to attach the myosin specifically to the pedestal bead . To achieve this , the cDNA sequence for the actin - binding domain of human α - actinin 1 ( ACTN1 ) ( residues 30 – 253 ) ( 56 ) containing a 5 ′ NdeI site and a 3 ′ BamH1 site was in - serted into the pET28a vector . The pET28a vector also contains a N - terminal hexahistadine tag for protein purification . The HaloTag cDNA sequence was cut from the pFC20A vector ( Promega ) between the BamH1 and HindIII sites and inserted into the pET vector containing the α - actinin gene insert . This vector was inserted into BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and expressed via IPTG induction . The protein was purified by running the cell lysate over a NiNTA column fol - lowed by a FLPC MonoQ column ( 0 – 1 - M KCl gradient ) . HaloTag α - actinin – conjugated beads were prepared as follows . First , 1 . 0 - μ m diameter amino - functionalized polystyrene beads ( 2 . 5 % solids ; Poly - sciences ) were washed twice in distilled water and then resuspended in PBS , pH 7 . 0 . HaloTag succinimidyl ester O2 ligand ( Promega ) was then added to 1 mM and allowed to incubate with the beads for 1 h at room temperature . The beads were then washed three times in KMg25 buffer and resuspended with 100 – 200 μ M HaloTag α - actinin in KMg25 buffer . This mixture was allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37°C before being washed three times in KMg25 buffer . The beads were then resuspended in KMg25 bufferand either used within 1 . 5 weeks or flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C . HaloTagged α - actinin beads were able to bind to actin and maintain preten - sions in excess of 6 pN for greater than 15 min , even in the presence of saturating ( 5 mM ) ATP . Motility Chamber Preparation . Nitrocellulose - coated motility chambers con - taining 1 . 9 μ m silica beads as pedestals ( Bangs Laboratories ) were prepared as described ( 20 ) . Solutions were added sequentially to the chamber as follows : 0 . 1 mg ∕ mL streptavidin in water ( 5 min ) ; 1 mg ∕ mL bovine serum al - bumin in KMg25 ( 2 times 5 min ) ; 2 – 10 nM biotinylated myo 1 c 3 IQ in KMg 25 þ 2 μ Mcalmodulin ( 5min ) ; washed2 - times withKMg25buffer ; and1nMTRITC phalloidin – labeled F - actin in KMg25 with 1 mg ∕ mL glucose , 1 mg ∕ mL bovine serum albumin , the desired concentration of ATP , 2 μ M calmodulin , 192 U ∕ mL glucose oxidase , and 48 μ g ∕ mL catalase ( Roche ) . Beads coated with HaloTagged α - actinin were added to one side of the chamber to replace approximately one - fourth the volume of the chamber . The chamber was sealed with silicon vacuum grease ( Dow Corning ) . Optical Trapping . Single - molecule actomyosin interactions were recorded using the three - bead assay geometry in a dual - beam optical - trap system as described ( 20 , 31 ) . For each bead – actin – bead assembly , the trap stiffness and the system - calibration factor were determined by fitting a Lorentzian function to the power spectrum . Trap stiffnesses were approximately 0 . 02 – 0 . 03 pN ∕ nm . Bead – actin – bead assemblies were pre - tensioned to 3 – 6 pN and lowered onto the surface of a bead pedestal using a piezoelectric stage con - troller to scan for actomyosin interactions . Upon observation of interactions , data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized with a 2 - kHz sampling rate for up to 10 min . Single - molecule conditions were verified by ( i ) diluting the myosin such that approximately one in three pedestals yielded actomyosin inter - actions , and ( ii ) examining the distributions of covariances for each single - molecule trace ( 20 ) ( see below ) . The force dependence of actomyosin - attachment lifetimes was measured using an isometric optical clamp that applies a dynamic load to the actomyo - sin to keep the actin filament near its isometric position during the myosin working stroke as described ( 20 , 34 , 35 ) . Briefly , changes in the force on the bead attached to the pointed end of the actin filament ( transducer bead ) were fed through an analog - integrating feedback amplifier to an acousto - optic deflector , which moved the position of the bead bound to the barbed end of the actin filament ( motor bead ) until the position of the transducer bead was restored to its original position . The response time of the feedback loop in the absence of interactions was adjusted to 50 ms . A positive force is defined as a force that opposes the myosin working stroke . Event Selection and Ensemble Averaging . To determine the start and end points of actomyosin attachments , a covariance - threshold selection was used as described ( 20 ) , using custom software written in LabView ( National Instru - ments ) . The covariance of the transducer and motor beads was calculated with an 85 - ms sliding window and the resulting signal was smoothed over a 50 - ms sliding window to construct distributions of covariance values ( 20 ) . The distribution of covariances was bimodal , with one peak corresponding to the detached state and the other corresponding to the actomyosin - attached state . The beginning of the interaction is defined as the time when the mea - sured covariance became smaller than the covariance at the minimum value between thetwo covariance peaks . Theend oftheinteraction was defined as the point where the covariance rose above that same threshold . To reduce false - positive events caused by transient decreases in covariance during un - attached periods , only events longer than 50 ms ( the width of the smoothing window ) were scored as events . Changing the width of the smoothing win - dowto15mstoallowfordetectionofeventsasshortas15msdidnotchange the force - dependent behavior ( Fig . S4 ) . Ensemble averages were constructed by synchronizing single - molecule interactions and then averaging the inter - actions forward and reverse in time as described ( 20 , 24 , 32 ) . Power - Output Calculations . The power output of the different myosin iso - forms was calculated as the average power per myosin head . To do this , the velocity as a function of force , V ð F Þ , was calculated as : V ð F Þ ¼ w · k det ð F Þ , where w is the size of the total working stroke and k det ð F Þ is the force - de - pendent actomyosin - detachment rate .

Finally , the average power was calculated by multiplying the power produced by myosin during actin attachment by the myosin duty ratio , r , where the duty ratio is given by : r ð F Þ ¼ k rls k rls þ k det ð F Þ and k rls is the rate - limiting step for the detached states [ e . g . , k ss · ½ actin (cid:2) for myo1c ] . Thus , the average power per myosin head , P ð F Þ , is given by the expression : P ð F Þ ¼ F · w · k det ð F Þ · k rls k rls þ k det ð F Þ : [ 4 ] Statistics and Curve Fitting . Single or double exponential functions were fitted to stopped - flow fluorescence transients using the software supplied with the instrument . Fitting of the kinetic rates as a function of nucleotide was done in Kaleidagraph ( Synergy Software ) . For all fitted curves , the error bars represent the error in determination of the fit parameter . For all derived parameters , errors were propagated by calculating partial derivatives . Fitting of ensemble averages was performed with custom software written in Matlab ( Mathworks ) . Two - sample Kolmogorov – Smirnov tests were carried out using Matlab . The force - dependent lifetimes are exponentiallydistributed at eachforce , and thus maximum - likelihood estimation was used to determine the para - meter values for these experiments ( 20 ) . Confidence intervals for each un - iquely determined parameter were found by simulating the data with a bootstrap routine ; 1 , 000 bootstrapped datasets were generated and fit inde - pendently for all of the relevant parameters . The 90 % confidence intervals were determined by numerically ordering the values determined by boot - strapping and then finding the bounds that contain (cid:1) 45 % of the data from the median value .
