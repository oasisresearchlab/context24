In contrast , the mechanisms 49 through which the biophysical properties of membrane lipids influence cancer cell 50 survival , dedifferentiation and metastasis have received little scrutiny . Here , we report 51 that cancer cells endowed with a high metastatic ability and cancer stem cell - like traits 52 employ ether lipids to maintain low membrane tension and high membrane fluidity . 53 Using genetic approaches and lipid reconstitution assays , we show that these ether 54 lipid - regulated biophysical properties permit non - clathrin - mediated iron endocytosis via 55 CD44 , leading directly to significant increases in intracellular redox - active iron and 56 enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility . Using a combination of in vitro three - dimensional 57 microvascular network systems and in vivo animal models , we show that loss of ether 58 lipids also strongly attenuates extravasation , metastatic burden and cancer stemness . 59 These findings illuminate a mechanism whereby ether lipids in carcinoma cells serve as 60 key regulators of malignant progression while conferring a unique vulnerability that can 61 be exploited for therapeutic intervention . 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 KEYWORDS 91 Ether lipids , membrane tension , endocytosis , CD44 , iron , metastasis , ferroptosis . 92 INTRODUCTION 93 Cancer cells have the capacity to undergo dynamic changes in identity , structure , 94 and function , making them remarkably versatile and adaptable . Alterations in the lipid 95 composition of cell membranes is one key element contributing to the phenotypic 96 plasticity of cells . The distinctive physicochemical properties and subcellular localization 97 of various lipids within cell membranes influence a range of biological processes , 98 including cellular trafficking , signaling and metabolism 1 . Despite our growing knowledge 99 of lipid biology , our understanding of how specific lipid subtypes impact cancer cell fate 100 remains limited . 101 Emerging studies have demonstrated that therapy - resistant mesenchymal - like 102 carcinoma cells exhibit an elevated vulnerability to ferroptosis 2 - 4 , an iron - dependent 103 form of cell death characterized by the unrestricted accumulation of oxidized membrane 104 phospholipids 5 - 7 . Indeed , in previous work we showed that the natural product 105 salinomycin can selectively eliminate otherwise therapy resistant , mesenchymal - 106 enriched cancer stem cells ( CSC ) , doing so by targeting lysosomal iron to promote an 107 iron - dependent cell death 4 , 8 , 9 . In this context , we found that such CSC - enriched cells 108 exhibit a high intracellular iron load compared to their non - CSC - like counterparts , 109 rendering them especially vulnerable to elimination by induced ferroptosis 13 , 14 . 110 Ferroptosis can also be instigated by pharmacologic inhibition of ferroptosis 111 suppressors , such as glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) 5 , 10 , ferroptosis - suppressor 112 protein 1 ( FSP1 , previously known as AIFM2 ) 11 , 12 , as well as through downregulation of 113 reduced glutathione ( GSH ) 13 , 14 . Activated CD8 + T cells may also induce ferroptosis in 114 cancer cells 9 , 10 . Beyond cancer , ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 115 several neurodegenerative diseases and acute injury of the kidney , liver and heart 15 - 18 . 116 In previous work , we undertook an unbiased , genome - wide CRISPR / Cas9 117 screen with the goal of identifying genes that govern ferroptosis susceptibility in high - 118 grade human serous ovarian cancer cells 19 . This screen revealed a previously 119 unrecognized role for ether lipid - synthesizing enzymes , such as alkylglycerone 120 phosphate synthase ( AGPS ) , in modulating ferroptosis susceptibility . The ether 121 phospholipids generated by these enzymes represent a unique subclass of 122 glycerophospholipids characterized by an ether - linked hydrocarbon group formed at the 123 sn - 1 position of the glycerol backbone 20 . This phospholipid subtype constitutes ~ 20 % of 124 the total phospholipid pool in many types of mammalian cells . 125 The significance of ether lipid species in human health is underscored by the 126 severe inherited peroxisomal disorders caused by their deficiency 20 . This often 127 manifests as profound developmental abnormalities , such as neurological defects , 128 visual and hearing loss , and reduced lifespan . In the context of cancer , elevated ether 129 lipid levels have been correlated with increased metastatic potential of carcinoma 130 cells 21 - 24 . Despite these pathological associations , the mechanism ( s ) by which ether 131 lipids affect cancer progression remain ( s ) elusive . Furthermore , exactly why loss of 132 ether lipids results in decreased ferroptosis susceptibility required further investigation . 133 Our previous work and that of others ascribed a role to polyunsaturated ether 134 phospholipids as chemical substrates prone to the iron - mediated oxidation that triggers 135 ferroptotic cell death 19 , 25 . Here , we demonstrate that ether lipids also play an unrelated 136 biophysical role , doing so by facilitating iron endocytosis in carcinoma cells . This 137 represents an unappreciated mechanism of intracellular signaling in which a lipid 138 contributes to the intracellular level of a critical metal - based signaling species - iron . In 139 addition , our findings highlight the functional importance of this poorly studied lipid 140 subtype in enabling a variety of malignancy - associated cell phenotypes including 141 metastasis and tumor - initiating abilities . Together , these results establish a role for ether 142 lipids as critical effectors of cancer cell fate . 143 144 RESULTS 145 Ether lipids play a key role in maintaining a ferroptosis susceptible cell state 146 In order to investigate the mechanism ( s ) by which ether lipid deficiency reduces 147 ferroptosis susceptibility , we employed CRISPR / Cas9 to knockout ( KO ) the AGPS gene , 148 in ferroptosis - sensitive TGF - β - treated PyMT - 1099 murine breast cancer cells 26 ( Fig . 1a , 149 1b , Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . The AGPS gene encodes a rate - limiting enzyme critical for 150 ether lipid biosynthesis 20 . Consistent with our prior studies 19 , loss of ether lipids via 151 AGPS KO significantly decreased the susceptibility of these cancer cells to ferroptosis 152 induced by treatment with the GPX4 inhibitors ML210 or RSL3 ( Fig . 1c , Extended Data 153 Fig . 1b ) . 154 By performing lipidomic analysis , we validated that knockout of AGPS resulted in 155 a significant reduction in total ether abundance in these cells ( Fig . 1d ) . More than half of 156 the identified ether lipids contained polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups which are highly 157 prone to free radical attack ( Fig . 1e ) . Based on this observation , we speculated that loss 158 of ether lipids could attenuate ferroptosis susceptibility by depleting the pool of available 159 ether lipid substrates for lipid peroxidation . Therefore , we performed oxidized lipidomic 160 analysis on two ferroptosis - sensitive breast cancer cell lines that were treated with a 161 GPX4 inhibitor . These experiments indicated that ether lipids could indeed be oxidized 162 following ferroptosis induction ( Fig . 1f , Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . 163 Given that ether lipids only constitute about ~ 20 % of total lipids , we also 164 investigated whether the relative abundance of non - ether - linked polyunsaturated 165 phospholipids , were impacted by loss of ether lipids . Surprisingly , our analyses revealed 166 that ether lipid deficiency actually increased the relative abundance of several 167 polyunsaturated diacyl phospholipids with putative pro - ferroptosis function 27 , 28 ( Fig . 1g ) . 168 To ensure that these findings were not an idiosyncrasy of our TGF - β - treated PyMT - 1099 169 AGPS KO cells , we confirmed this observation in PyMT - MMTV - derived pB3 murine 170 AGPS KO breast cancer cells 29 ( Fig . 1h , 1i , Extended Data Fig . 1d ) . Importantly , re - 171 expression of AGPS ( i . e . , “addback” ) could restore the relative levels of these non - 172 ether - linked polyunsaturated diacyl phospholipids to levels comparable to pB3 WT cells 173 ( Fig . 1j ) . These findings strongly argue against the notion that ether deficiency 174 attenuates ferroptosis susceptibility simply by decreasing the global level of 175 polyunsaturated phospholipids and further underscores the importance of 176 polyunsaturated ether phospholipids in maintaining a ferroptosis susceptible cell state . 177 178 Ether lipids regulate cellular redox - active iron levels in cancer cells 179 The above observations together with our oxidized ether phospholipidomic 180 analysis supported the notion that ether lipids could modulate ferroptosis susceptibility , 181 at least in part , by serving as substrates for lipid peroxidation . These observations , 182 however , failed to address the formal possibility that alterations of ether lipid 183 composition could also affect intracellular levels of redox - active iron , the central 184 mediator of the lipid peroxidation that drives ferroptosis . For this reason , we investigated 185 whether alterations in ether lipid composition actually affected the intracellular levels of 186 redox - active iron . To address this possibility , we used two orthogonal analyses to 187 assess intracellular iron levels . Since the endolysosomal compartment is a key reservoir 188 of iron within cells 30 - 32 , we used a lysosomal iron ( II ) - specific fluorescent probe , 189 RhoNox - M 33 , to gauge the levels of iron within these cells . In addition , we used 190 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP - MS ) to quantify total intracellular 191 iron levels 32 , 34 , 35 . 192 Remarkably , loss of AGPS reduced intracellular iron levels in all murine cancer 193 cell lines tested , whereas re - expression of AGPS ( i . e . , “addback” ) restored intracellular 194 iron to levels comparable to those seen in parental ferroptosis - sensitive cancer cells 195 ( Fig . 2a - 2d , Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . This provided the first indication that changes in 196 ether phospholipids directly affect the levels of intracellular iron . Indeed , there was no 197 direct precedent for the ability of a membrane - associated phospholipid to serve as an 198 enhancer of the levels of an intracellular metal ion . 199 Supporting this conclusion , we found that a reduction in the levels of ether lipids , 200 achieved via knockout of the genes encoding either the AGPS or the fatty acid 201 reductase 1 ( FAR1 ) enzymes 20 ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) , also resulted in a significant 202 decrease in intracellular iron levels , in this case in the mesenchymal - enriched OVCAR8 203 human high - grade serous ovarian cancer cell line ( Fig . 2e , 2f ) . Furthermore , we noted 204 that treatment of AGPS KO cells with ferric ammonium citrate ( FAC ) 36 , 37 , which provides 205 an exogenous source of ferric ions re - sensitized cultured AGPS KO mesenchymal 206 breast and ovarian carcinoma cells to ferroptosis induction , doing so even in the 207 absence of elevated ether phospholipids ( Fig . 2g , 2h ) . 208 We further extended this analysis by studying the behavior of mammary 209 carcinoma cells forming tumors in vivo . Consistent with our in vitro data , inductively 210 coupled plasma mass spectrometry indicated that total iron levels are reduced in breast 211 tumors derived from implanted pB3 AGPS KO carcinoma cells relative to those arising 212 from pB3 wildtype ( WT ) or control pB3 AGPS - addback cells ( Fig . 2i ) . Such observations 213 reinforced the notion that ether lipids are critical regulators of intracellular iron levels , a 214 rate - limiting component of ferroptosis . 215 216 Ether lipids facilitate CD44 - mediated iron endocytosis 217 We proceeded to investigate the mechanism ( s ) by which membrane - associated 218 ether lipids regulate intracellular iron content . This led us to examine the behavior of two 219 proteins that act as major mediators of cellular iron import - transferrin receptor 1 220 ( TfR1 ) 38 and CD44 32 – and whether their functioning was altered in response to loss of 221 ether phospholipids . While CD44 is best known as a cell - surface cancer stem - cell 222 marker 39 , 40 , recent research revealed its critical role in mediating endocytosis of iron - 223 bound hyaluronates in CSC - enriched cancer cells and in activated immune cells 32 , 41 . To 224 monitor these two alternative iron import mechanisms , we performed endocytosis 225 kinetics experiments using fluorescently labeled transferrin as a proxy for TfR1 226 internalization and fluorescently labeled hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , whose main plasma 227 membrane receptor is CD44 , as a marker for CD44 internalization 42 , 43 . 228 Here we observed that the rate of endocytosis of TfR1 was marginally affected by 229 a deficiency of ether lipids in pB3 breast cancer cells ( Fig . 3a ) . In stark contrast , CD44 - 230 mediated endocytosis was significantly impaired when the AGPS gene was knocked out 231 in this ether lipid - deficient , cancer cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Conversely , CD44 - dependent iron 232 import could be restored to normal levels by introduction of a functional AGPS gene into 233 these AGPS KO cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Reduction in the rate of internalization of CD44 but not 234 TfR1 could also be observed in ether lipid - deficient PyMT - 1099 TGF - β - treated breast 235 cancer cells ( Fig . 3c , 3d ) . Hence , in these cells , ether lipids played a critical role in 236 modulating intracellular iron concentration by regulating endocytosis of CD44 but not 237 transferrin receptor . These findings were consistent with our previous observations that 238 TfR1 and CD44 localize to distinct endocytic vesicles in CSC - enriched cancer cells 32 , 44 239 making plausible that their internalization was governed by independent endocytic 240 mechanisms . 241 To further support the role of CD44 in promoting iron uptake – acting via its 242 endocytosis of HA – we demonstrate that knocking out the gene encoding CD44 or , 243 alternatively , treating cancer cells with hyaluronidase , led to a significant reduction in 244 intracellular iron levels ( Fig . 3e ) . Conversely , supplementing these cells with hyaluronic 245 acid increased intracellular iron levels ( Fig . 3e ) . Similar observations were seen in 246 human OVCAR8 cells ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . Taken together , these observations 247 further supported the influential role of CD44 in mediating iron uptake in these cancer 248 cells 32 . 249 We then studied whether the observed defect in CD44 endocytosis observed in 250 ether lipid deficient cells was limited to CD44 or , instead , reflected a general impairment 251 in the endocytosis of a variety of plasma membrane - associated glycoproteins . In fact , 252 CD44 is known to undergo a type of clathrin - and dynamin - independent form of 253 endocytosis 44 - 46 . This alternative mechanism of endocytosis differs from the one 254 regulating TfR1 recycling , which undergoes clathrin - mediated endocytosis , in which 255 small invaginations of clathrin - coated pits undergo scission facilitated by the GTPase 256 dynamin 45 , 47 . 257 To test whether loss of ether phospholipids had a wider effect on the clathrin - and 258 dynamin - independent mode of endocytosis , we examined the rate of uptake of dextran 259 ( 70 kDa ) , a branched polysaccharide known to undergo endocytosis by a clathrin - 260 independent mechanism 45 . Similar to CD44 , we observed that loss of AGPS also 261 exhibited a significant reduction in the rate of dextran endocytosis ; this behavior could 262 be reversed by restoration of ether phospholipids levels achieved by AGPS 263 complementation ( Fig . 3f , 3g ) . Moreover , the loss of ether lipids had a negligible effect 264 on the rate of EGFR endocytosis which , like TfR1 , is known to rely on clathrin - mediated 265 endocytosis ( Fig . 3h , Extended Data Fig . 3b ) . 266 Hence , these observations reinforced the notion that the internalization of 267 extracellular and cell - surface molecules is mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms 268 that differ in their dependence on ether phospholipids . More specifically , these findings 269 provided strong support for the involvement of a widely acting clathrin - and dynamin - 270 independent form of endocytosis , on which CD44 internalization depended 32 , 48 - 50 and is 271 significantly compromised in ether lipid - deficient cells . 272 273 Ether lipid deficiency impairs membrane biophysical properties 274 The above observations did not provide mechanistic insights into how changes in 275 the composition of membrane ether lipids could exert an effect on CD44 internalization . 276 As observed by others , non - clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is employed by CD44 , 277 is particularly sensitive to changes in the physicochemical properties of the lipid bilayer 278 forming plasma membranes 46 , 51 - 56 . Such changes can influence membrane tension , 279 membrane fluidity and stability , and formation of lipid rafts , all of which , in turn , impact 280 the assembly and dynamics of clathrin - independent , cell - surface endocytic structures . 281 Hence , we hypothesized that ether lipids alter the biophysical properties of the lipid 282 bilayer of the plasma membrane to facilitate elevated iron endocytosis via CD44 . 283 Membrane deformability can be gauged by the parameter of membrane tension , 284 which measures the forces exerted on a defined cross - section of the plasma 285 membrane . It is influenced by both the in - plane tension of the lipid bilayer and the 286 attachment of the plasma membrane to the underlying cell cortex 57 , 58 . Indeed , 287 alterations in membrane tension have long been demonstrated to affect endocytosis 59 - 288 64 , prompting us to assess the effects of loss of ether lipids on plasma membrane 289 tension . To quantify membrane tension directly , we generated a membrane tether using 290 an optically trapped bead and measured the pulling force ( f ) and the tube radius ( R ) to 291 calculate membrane tension ( σ ) of living cells 48 , 65 ( Fig . 4a , 4b ) . We found that depletion 292 of ether phospholipids led to a significant increase in membrane tension in pB3 AGPS 293 KO cells relative to the corresponding pB3 WT cancer cells ( Fig . 4c ) . This shift was 294 largely attenuated upon restoration of AGPS expression in pB3 AGPS KO cells or upon 295 exposure of cultured cells to liposomes composed of polyunsaturated ether 296 phospholipids ( Fig . 4c ) . Treatment of pB3 AGPS KO cells with these ether lipid - 297 containing liposomes also increased the rate of CD44 endocytosis to levels comparable 298 to those of pB3 WT cells ( Fig . 4d ) . No changes were observed in the rate of clathrin - 299 dependent TfR1 endocytosis under these conditions ( Fig . 4e ) . Taken together , these 300 results provided the first indication that ether lipids facilitate CD44 - mediated iron 301 endocytosis in cancer cells , in part , by decreasing membrane tension . 302 Membrane lipid packing can also impact endocytosis 66 - 68 . It is related to the 303 fluidity or viscosity of the lipid bilayer , with higher lipid packing correlating with higher 304 viscosity . This , in turn , affects the ease with which proteins and lipids undergo lateral 305 diffusion and conformational changes within a lipid bilayer , thereby affecting 306 endocytosis - related signaling 48 . This motivated us to investigate the contribution of ether 307 lipids to membrane lipid packing . To do so , we used the C - laurdan lipid - based , polarity - 308 sensitive dye , which yields a spectral emission shift dependent on the degree of lipid 309 packing 69 . These measurements are used to calculate a unitless index , termed 310 generalized polarization ( GP ) , where a higher GP indicates increased lipid packing 69 . 311 Our measurements using the C - laurdan dye indicated that a reduction in ether lipid 312 levels resulted in a measurable , significant increase in membrane packing ( Fig . 4f - 4h ) , 313 which , like increase increases in membrane tension , negatively affects membrane 314 plasticity 66 . 315 A third parameter governing the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers involves 316 the stability ( size and lifetime ) of lipid rafts . This parameter can be gauged by monitoring 317 the miscibility transition temperature ( T misc ) of these membranes 70 . The association of 318 CD44 with lipid rafts , which are dynamically formed plasma membrane microdomains , is 319 known to be critical for CD44 - mediated HA endocytosis 71 . We reasoned that a decrease 320 in the stability of lipid rafts , and thus a decrease in T misc , would result in impairment of 321 CD44 endocytosis 70 . Thus , we measured the effect of loss of ether lipids on the 322 miscibility transition temperature . In fact , we observed a decrease in T misc upon loss of 323 AGPS in pB3 cancer cells , which indicated a decrease in lipid raft stability . This finding 324 supports a role for ether lipids in maintaining the plasma membrane organization 325 through lipid raft microdomains ( Fig . 4i ) , revealing yet another biophysical property of 326 lipid bilayers that can influence CD44 endocytosis . 327 It is noteworthy that clathrin - independent endocytosis exhibits a greater 328 dependency on the membrane biophysical properties assessed above 46 , 51 - 56 . This may 329 explain why loss of ether lipids can exert a significant effect on the rate of CD44 - 330 mediated iron endocytosis but negligible effects on the clathrin - mediated TfR1 331 endocytosis . Furthermore , these findings illuminated a mechanism by which membrane - 332 associated ether lipids could govern a major mechanism of iron internalization , which in 333 turn could impact the vulnerability of cancer cells to ferroptosis inducers . 334 335 Loss of ether lipids decreases metastasis and cancer cell stemness 336 Prior studies have demonstrated that reduced membrane tension and elevated 337 intracellular iron can promote cancer metastasis 72 - 76 . These findings of others caused us 338 to investigate whether changes in the ether lipid composition of cancer cells impacted 339 key steps of the multi - step invasion - metastasis cascade , notably extravasation 340 efficiency , post - extravasation proliferation 77 , as well as the functionally critical trait of 341 cancer cell stemness , i . e . , tumor - initiating ability . 342 We measured extravasation efficiency by employing an in vitro three - dimensional 343 microvascular network system composed of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 344 ( HUVECs ) and normal human lung fibroblasts . This system has been shown to 345 accurately model some of the complex biological processes associated with cancer cell 346 extravasation 78 - 82 . Using this defined experimental system , we found that loss of ether 347 lipids significantly decreased extravasation efficiency ( Fig . 5a - 5c ) . Furthermore , we 348 observed a strong reduction in overall metastatic burden following intracardiac injection 349 in syngeneic hosts of the pB3 AGPS KO breast cancer cells relative to corresponding 350 wildtype cells ( Fig . 5d - 5f ) . As an important control in these experiments , we determined 351 that ether lipid deficiency in these cells had a modest effect on primary tumor growth 352 kinetics , making it unlikely that the loss of ether phospholipids had a significant effect on 353 post - extravasation proliferation of disseminated tumor cells ( Fig . 5g - 5i ) . A decrease in 354 metastatic burden was also observed upon knockout of AGPS and FAR1 in OVCAR8 355 cancer cells , and upon loss of CD44 in pB3 cancer cells ( Extended Data Fig . 4a - 4c ) . 356 Given that high CD44 expression and elevated intracellular iron levels are 357 positively correlated with cancer cell stemness 32 , 39 , 83 , we investigated whether ether 358 lipid deficiency also affects the tumor - initiating capacity of cancer cells as gauged by an 359 experimental limiting dilution tumor - implantation assay . These experiments indicated 360 that loss of ether lipids in pB3 breast cancer cells decreases cancer cell stemness ( Fig . 361 5j , Extended Data Fig . 4d ) , which , as we have found in other investigations , serve as a 362 reliable marker of metastasis - initiating capacity 84 . In addition , we found that loss of ether 363 lipids significantly attenuates the tumor - initiating potential and metastatic capacity of 364 PyMT - 1099 AGPS KO TGF - β - treated ( ether lipid deficient ) cancer cells following 365 implantation into the orthotopic site – – the mammary stromal fat pad ( Fig . 5k - 5m ) . 366 Hence , ether lipids play critical roles in promoting cancer cell stemness and resulting 367 post - extravasation colonization . 368 369 DISCUSSION 370 The present findings indicate the need to consider the complex interplay between 371 genetics and the biophysical properties of cell membranes as determinants of cancer 372 cell fate and emphasize the potential role of lipids and metals in this process . 373 Membrane - associated phospholipids have previously been implicated as important 374 mediators of cell transformation , in large part through the actions of inositol 375 phospholipids and their derivatives 85 . In the present study , we shed light on an entirely 376 different and poorly studied role of lipids in influencing cell fate through their effects on 377 membrane biophysical properties and their impact on iron homeostasis . Specifically , we 378 uncover a mechanism whereby alterations in ether lipids affect the biophysical 379 properties of the plasma membrane to impact distinct cell - biological processes – – iron 380 uptake and neoplasia - related phenotypes , notably metastasis and cancer cell 381 stemness / tumor - initiating ability . Importantly , this biochemical configuration creates a 382 unique vulnerability of cancer cells to ferroptosis , and suggests that targeting lipid 383 metabolism and iron homeostasis could be exploited to suppress subpopulations of 384 highly metastatic and drug - tolerant carcinoma cells 86 . 385 Ether phospholipids have been widely portrayed as participants in ferroptosis 386 through their role as substrates prone to iron - catalyzed peroxidation . However , our 387 findings indicate an entirely different mechanism whereby ether lipids directly modulate 388 the levels of intracellular iron , a rate - limiting component governing ferroptosis 389 susceptibility 4 , 32 , 73 . By emphasizing the role of membrane biophysical properties in 390 governing iron uptake , we depart from the conventional focus limited to portraying 391 phospholipids as substrates for peroxidation . This shift in perspective has the potential 392 to open new avenues for research , as it challenges researchers to explore the 393 biophysical aspects of membranes as a new dimension in the regulation of this cell 394 death program . 395 Alterations in intracellular iron level can impact gene expression via various 396 mechanisms including modulation of chromatin - modifying enzyme activity 32 , 87 , 88 . For 397 example , increase of intracellular iron levels has been shown to promote the activity of 398 iron - dependent demethylases 32 , 87 , 88 , impacting gene expression profiles underlying cell 399 plasticity 32 and immune cell activation 41 . Our finding that ether lipid deficiency reduces 400 intracellular iron levels explains , at least in part , how loss of ether lipids may impact 401 cancer - associated transcriptional programs , acting at the epigenetic level and enabling 402 a variety of malignancy - associated cell phenotypes including metastasis and cancer 403 stemness . Such mechanisms may act in concert with non - iron - dependent processes , 404 which are also regulated by ether lipids to affect cancer malignancy traits . 405 The implications of our research findings may extend far beyond the realm of 406 cancer pathogenesis . We speculate that the biophysical modulation of membranes and 407 its intersection with iron biology could be a widely - acting determinant of cell fate , 408 impacting processes such as differentiation , immune activation , wound healing , and 409 embryonic development . 410 411 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 412 We thank all members of the Weinberg , Farese and Walther labs for insightful 413 discussions and reagents .

Moses 29 . 687g cells ( also called EpCAM Lo Snail - YFP Hi ) were 670 originally established from tumors that developed in the MMTV - PyMT - Snail - IRES - YFP 671 reporter mouse model , previously developed by the Weinberg lab 89 . pB3 and 687g cell 672 lines were cultured in 1 : 1 DMEM / F12 medium containing 5 % adult bovine serum with 673 1 % penicillin - streptomycin and 1 % non - essential amino acids 29 . The PyMT - 1099 murine 674 breast cancer cell line was a kind gift from the laboratory of Gerald Christofori and 675 cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % penicillin - 676 streptomycin and 1 % glutamine 26 . These cells were treated with 2 ng / ml of TGF - β for 10 677 days , prior to performing any subsequent analyses . OVCAR8 cells were obtained from 678 the laboratory of Joan Brugge and cultured in 1 : 1 MCDB 105 medium / Medium 199 679 Earle’s Eagles medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin - 680 streptomycin . All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . All 681 cells were negative for mycoplasma . Human cell line authentication ( CLA ) analysis of 682 OVCAR8 cells were performed by the Duke University DNA Analysis facility . 683 Established murine lines have not been STR profiled . 684 685 Animal studies 686 All animal studies were conducted according to the MIT Committee on Animal Care 687 protocol . For primary tumor growth studies : 1 million cells were resuspended in 20 % 688 Matrigel / PBS and injected into the mammary fat pad of 6 - 8 weeks old female mice . 689 C57BL / 6 mice ( Jackson Laboratories ) were used for in vivo experiments with pB3 cells . 690 NSG mice were used for in vivo experiments with PyMT - 1099 cells . These cells were 691 pretreated with TGF - β ( 2 ng / ml ) for 10 days prior to injection . Tumor size was measured 692 once a week using a vernier caliper and tumor volume was calculated using the 693 formula : Tumor volume = length x width 2 / 2 , where length represents the largest tumor 694 diameter and width represents the perpendicular tumor diameter . For limiting dilution 695 tumor - initiating assays : pB3 WT or pB3 AGPS KO cells were resuspended in 20 % 696 Matrigel / PBS and injected into the mammary fat pad of 6 - 8 weeks old female C57BL / 6 697 mice ( Jackson Laboratories ) at the following dilutions : 100 , 000 , 10 , 000 , 1000 , 100 cells . 698 Animals were assessed for palpable tumors after 39 days post injection . The estimated 699 number of CSCs was calculated using the extreme limiting dilution analysis ( ELDA ) 700 software . For experimental metastasis involving pB3 cell lines , 0 . 2 million cells were 701 resuspended in 200µl of PBS and injected into the left ventricle of 6 - 8 weeks old female 702 C57BL / 6 mice . Metastatic burden was measured after 10 d post - injection via 703 bioluminescence in live animals using the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system . 704 Images were analyzed using Living Image software ( PerkinElmer ) . For OVCAR8 cells , 705 1 . 5 million cells were resuspended in PBS and implanted into 6 - 8 weeks old female 706 athymic nude mice ( Jackson Laboratories ) via intraperitoneal injections . Metastatic 707 burden was assessed after 6 weeks using a fluorescence dissecting microscope . 708 709 Generation of gene - edited cell lines using CRISPR / Cas9 710 With the exception of OVCAR8 cells , all AGPS KO single cell clones were generated via 711 transient transfection with mouse AGPS CRISPR / Cas9 KO Plasmids ( Catalog no . sc - 712 432759 , Santa Cruz ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . GFP - positive cells 713 were sorted via fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) into 96 - well plates with one 714 cell per well and single cell clones were subsequently expanded . AGPS KO single cell 715 clones were assessed for loss of AGPS expression via western blot analysis . pB3 716 AGPS addback cells were generated by transducing AGPS KO single cell clone with 717 pLV [ Exp ] - Puro - EF1A - mAgps lentiviral vector ( VectorBuilder ) . pB3 AGPS KO cells 718 expressing pLV [ Exp ] - Puro - EF1A - Stuffer _ 300bp ( VectorBuilder ) were established as 719 controls and noted as pB3 AGPS KO + EV in the manuscript . Lentivirus was produced 720 by transfecting HEK293T cells with viral envelope ( VSVG , Addgene ) and packaging 721 plasmids ( psPAX2 , Addgene ) . Viral supernatant was collected after 48 h and filtered 722 through a 0 . 45µm filter . Stably transduced cells were selected with 2 µg / ml puromycin . 723 OVCAR8 FAR1 KO and AGPS KO single cell clones as well as nontargeting control 724 cells , were established as previously described 19 . pB3 CD44 KO cells ( bulk ) were 725 generated using human CD44 CRISPR / Cas9 KO Plasmids ( Catalog no . sc - 419558 , 726 Santa Cruz ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 48 h post - transfection , 727 cells were sorted by flow cytometry for GFP positive cells , expanded in culture , and re - 728 sorted twice for CD44 negative cells using Alexa Fluor® 647 anti - mouse / human CD44 729 Antibody . Cells were maintained as bulk CD44 KO cells . 730 731 732 Plasmids Source pLV [ Exp ] - Puro - EF1A - Agps ( mouse ) VectorBuilder pLV [ Exp ] - Puro - EF1A - Stuffer _ 300bp VectorBuilder Mouse AGPS CRISPR / Cas9 KO Plasmids Catalog no . sc - 432759 , Santa Cruz Mouse CD44 / HCAM CRISPR / Cas9 KO Plasmids Catalog no . sc - 419558 , Santa Cruz LentiCRISPRv2 - puro - Nontargeting Published 19 LentiCRISPRv2 - puro - human AGPS sg Published 19 LentiCRISPRv2 - puro - human FAR1 sg Published 19 pLV - EF1A - eGFP - LUC VectorBuilder pCDH - EF1 - Luc2 - P2A - tdTomato Plasmid # 72486 , Addgene 733 Lipidomics analysis 734 735 Lipid extraction for mass spectrometry lipidomics 736 Mass spectrometry - based lipid analysis was performed by Lipotype GmbH ( Dresden , 737 Germany ) as described 90 . Lipids were extracted using a chloroform / methanol 738 procedure 91 . Samples were spiked with internal lipid standard mixture containing : 739 cardiolipin 14 : 0 / 14 : 0 / 14 : 0 / 14 : 0 ( CL ) , ceramide 18 : 1 ; 2 / 17 : 0 ( Cer ) , diacylglycerol 740 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( DAG ) , hexosylceramide 18 : 1 ; 2 / 12 : 0 ( HexCer ) , lyso - phosphatidate 17 : 0 741 ( LPA ) , lyso - phosphatidylcholine 12 : 0 ( LPC ) , lyso - phosphatidylethanolamine 17 : 1 ( LPE ) , 742 lyso - phosphatidylglycerol 17 : 1 ( LPG ) , lyso - phosphatidylinositol 17 : 1 ( LPI ) , lyso - 743 phosphatidylserine 17 : 1 ( LPS ) , phosphatidate 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( PA ) , phosphatidylcholine 744 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( PC ) , phosphatidylethanolamine 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( PE ) , phosphatidylglycerol 745 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( PG ) , phosphatidylinositol 16 : 0 / 16 : 0 ( PI ) , phosphatidylserine 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( PS ) , 746 cholesterol ester 20 : 0 ( CE ) , sphingomyelin 18 : 1 ; 2 / 12 : 0 ; 0 ( SM ) , triacylglycerol 747 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ( TAG ) . After extraction , the organic phase was transferred to an infusion 748 plate and dried in a speed vacuum concentrator . The dry extract was re - suspended in 749 7 . 5 mM ammonium formiate in chloroform / methanol / propanol ( 1 : 2 : 4 , V : V : V ) . All liquid 750 handling steps were performed using Hamilton Robotics STARlet robotic platform with 751 the Anti Droplet Control feature for organic solvents pipetting . 752 753 MS data acquisition 754 Samples were analyzed by direct infusion on a QExactive mass spectrometer ( Thermo 755 Scientific ) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate ion source ( Advion Biosciences ) . 756 Samples were analyzed in both positive and negative ion modes with a resolution of 757 R m / z = 200 = 280000 for MS and R m / z = 200 = 17500 for MSMS experiments , in a single 758 acquisition . MSMS was triggered by an inclusion list encompassing corresponding MS 759 mass ranges scanned in 1 Da increments 92 . Both MS and MSMS data were combined 760 to monitor CE , DAG and TAG ions as ammonium adducts ; LPC , LPC O - , PC , PC O - , as 761 formiate adducts ; and CL , LPS , PA , PE , PE O - , PG , PI and PS as deprotonated anions . 762 MS only was used to monitor LPA , LPE , LPE O - , LPG and LPI as deprotonated anions ; 763 Cer , HexCer and SM as formiate adducts . 764 765 Data analysis and post - processing 766 Data were analyzed with in - house developed lipid identification software based on 767 LipidXplorer 93 , 94 .
