In this study , we found that Rab34 is over - expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells , implying a potential role of Rab34 in breast cancer . Silencing Rab34 by shRNA inhibits cell migration , invasion , and adhesion of breast cancer cells . Rab34 speci ﬁ cally binds to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β 3 , and depletion of Rab34 promotes the degradation of integrin β 3 . Interestingly , EGF induces the translocation of Rab34 to the membrane ruf ﬂ e , which is greatly enhanced by the expression of Src kinase . Accordingly , Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src at Y247 residue . A mutant mimicking phosphorylated form of Rab34 ( Rab34Y247D ) promotes cell migration and invasion . Importantly , the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is inhibited in cells in suspension , and increased with the cells re - adhesion . In addition , Rab34Y247D promotes cell adhesion , and enhances integrin β 3 endocytosis and recycling . The results uncover a role of Rab34 in migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and its involvement in cancer metastasis , and provide a novel mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 in regulating cell migration , invasion , and adhesion through modulating the endocytosis , stability , and recycling of integrin β 3 . Introduction Vesicle traf ﬁ cking is a fundamental cellular event to reg - ulate protein secretion , internalization , and degradation . Vesicle traf ﬁ cking along the secretory pathway and endo - cytic pathway drives the precise location and sorting of functionally different proteins among subcellular compart - ments , which is required for maintaining cell homeostasis and cellular signaling [ 1 , 2 ] . Especially , ligand induced endocytosis of surface receptor contributes to receptor activation and cell signaling , while lysosomal degradation of receptor results in signaling desensitization . Recycling of some endocytosed receptor back to the plasma membrane is important for signal relaying [ 3 ] . Dysregulation of endo - cytosis is involved in numerous human diseases such as cancer [ 4 ] . Endocytosis of junctional and adhesion proteins such as cadherins and integrin mediates epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , regulating cell migration , and invasion of cancer cells [ 5 , 6 ] . Rab small GTPases , a subfamily of Ras superfamily , are the key regulators in vesicle traf ﬁ cking , controlling mem - brane identity , vesicle budding , vesicle transport , docking , and membrane fusion events through interaction with its These authors contributed equally : L .

So far , over 70 members of Rab proteins have been characterized in mammalian cells , associated with different subcellular compartments to mediate divergent traf ﬁ cking routes [ 9 ] . Abnormal expres - sion of Rab proteins is related to diseases [ 10 ] . Several Rab proteins are closely linked to cancers . Rab25 is over - Rab34 regulates adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells 3699 expressed in ovarian and breast cancers , and promotes cancer progress by mediating Akt signaling and integrin recycling [ 11 , 12 ] . Rab21 regulates migration and focal adhesion of cancer cells by mediating integrin traf ﬁ cking [ 13 ] . Rab8 mediates exocytosis of MT1 - MMP to promote invasiveness of cancer cells [ 14 ] . Rab7 regulates the sur - vival of cancer cells [ 15 ] . Upregulation of Rab5 was found in pancreatic associated adenomas [ 16 ] . Rab23 is involved in cell migration and invasion of diffuse - type gastric cancer [ 17 ] . These discoveries suggest that Rab proteins may serve as therapeutic targets for cancer [ 18 ] . Rab34 was characterized as a Golgi - associated Rab protein , regulating spatial distribution of late endosomes / lysosomes through interaction with Rab - interacting lyso - somal protein ( RILP ) and recently reported folliculin [ 19 , 20 ] . Further investigations revealed that Rab34 may have divergent cell physiological functions . Rab34 modulates protein secretion from the Golgi apparatus through inter - action with munc13 effector [ 21 , 22 ] . Rab34 can be trans - located to the membrane ruf ﬂ es to promote macropinosome formation [ 23 ] . Interestingly Rab34 was proved to mediate micropinocytosis of nanoparticles by recent investigations [ 24 , 25 ] . Rab34 has also been found to regulate the stability of tight junction protein occludin [ 26 ] . A recent study reported that folliculin , a tumor suppressor , directs the formation of Rab34 – RILP complex and regulates the nutrient - dependent distribution of lysosomes [ 19 ] . The mRNA and protein expression levels of Rab34 are related to glioma grade progression and confer a poor prognosis in high - grade glioma patients [ 27 ] , suggesting a potential role of Rab34 in cancer . In view of the emerging roles of Rab proteins ( including Rab34 ) in cancer , we have tried to screen Rab proteins with abnormal expression in breast cancer by systematically examining the mRNA expression pro ﬁ les of Rab proteins ( 58 Rab proteins ) in 8 breast cancer cell lines by RT - PCR . Through this screening , we found Rab34 is uniquely over - expressed in more aggressive breast cancer cells . Therefore , we tried to ﬁ gure out the potential role of Rab34 in breast cancer . In this study , we found that Rab34 is over - expressed in both highly aggressive breast cancer cell lines and metastatic breast cancer tissues . Rab34 knockdown inhibits migration , adhesion , and invasion of breast cancer cells . We also found that Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src kinase , which promotes cell adhesion , and regulates integrin β 3 endocytosis and recycling . The results uncover a novel mechanism for Rab34 in regulating migration and invasion of breast cancer cells . Results Rab34 is over - expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells Through systematically examination of the mRNA expres - sion pro ﬁ les of Rab proteins in breast cancer cell lines by RT - PCR ( data not shown ) , we found the transcript of Rab34 is uniquely over - expressed in more aggressive breast cancer cells ( supplemental Fig . 1A ) . The protein level of Rab34 in different breast cancer cell lines was also examined by Western blot ( Fig . 1a ) , the result again con ﬁ rmed that Rab34 is highly expressed in MDA - MB - 231 , BT549 , and Hs578T breast cancer cell lines ( these cell lines are desig - nated high invasive breast cancer cell lines [ 28 , 29 ] ) , as compared to others with less aggressive property . Under the similar condition , Rab7 does not exhibit differential expression among these cells . To explore the clinical signi ﬁ cance of Rab34 in breast cancer , we examined the expression of Rab34 in breast cancer tissue samples . The transcript of Rab34 was detected by RT - PCR in a cDNA array from 40 cancer tissues and 9 normal tissues . Over - expression of Rab34 was detected in 65 % cancer samples ( 26 / 40 ) compared with that of in normal samples ( Fig . 1b ) . An immunohistochemical ana - lysis , using two separate breast cancer tissue arrays con - taining normal tissues and cancer tissues , demonstrated that the expression of Rab34 protein in normal and benign tissue is lower or absent , however , Rab34 is expressed in most of malignant and metastatic breast cancer samples , and with higher expression ( indicated by “ + + ” or “ + + + ” in sup - plemental table 1 , table 2 , supplemental Fig . 1B ) in about 62 % ( 47 / 76 ) cancer samples . The expression of Rab34 seems not relevant to the tumor grade , however , the Fig . 1 Expression of Rab34 in breast cancer and Rab34 knockdown inhibits invasion and migration of breast cancer cells . a Western blot showing Rab34 protein is preferentially over - expressed in highly aggressive breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB231 , BT549 , and Hs578t ) as compared to other less invasive cells . Rab7 expression did not exhibit this property . b The expression levels of Rab34 mRNA in breast tis - sues assessed by RT - PCR normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA . The cancer tissue samples ( samples 10 – 49 ) have higher expression levels than normal tissue samples ( samples 1 – 9 ) . c The representative pictures from Immunohistochemical staining ( IHC ) showing the expression of Rab34 in normal breast tissues , breast ductal carcinoma , breast lobular carcinoma , and breast distant metastatic cancer tissues . d Matrigel transwell invasion assay showed Rab34 knockdown in MDA - MB - 231 cells by two independent shRNAs targeting Rab34 inhibits cells invading through the PET membrane coated with matrigel , revealed by staining with crystal violet . e Wound healing assays showed Rab34 knockdown in MDA - MB - 231 cells or BT549 cells by shRNA - Rab34 inhibits cell migration . f Cancer metastasis experiments carried out by injection of MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing shRNA - Rab34 into mice through lateral tail vein , and metastasis was inves - tigated by examing the tumorigenesis in lung tissues . The GFP - ﬂ uorescent tumors were observed under ﬂ uorescence microscope . g Quantitative analysis of the result f from ﬁ ve independent experiments by Student ’ s t - test . h , i Similar experiments and process to f and g by using BT549 cell line expressing shRNA - Rab34 3700 L . Sun et al . metastatic cancer tissues have the highest expression level of Rab34 , and most of ductal carcinoma tissues have higher level of Rab34 , while lobular carcinoma tissues have comparable lower expression level ( Fig . 1c and supple - mental Fig . 1C ) . The results are consistent with the results that Rab34 is over - expressed in higher aggressive breast cancer cells , suggesting a potential role of Rab34 in reg - ulating breast cancer development . Rab34 knockdown inhibits cell migration and invasion Since Rab34 may play a role in breast cancer metastasis , we examined whether Rab34 is essential to regulate cell inva - sion and migration . Rab34 knockdown was achieved by pSuper - mediated expression of shRNA - Rab34 in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( supplemental Fig . 2A ) . Rab34 knockdown resulted in cells becoming shorter and round with degraded Fig . 2 Rab34 is related to cell adhesion . a MCF7 cells transfected with GFP - Rab34 - WT were starved for 6 h , then stimulated with EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 min to induce membrane ruf ﬂ ing , followed by immuno - staining for actin ( red ) to indicate membrane ruf ﬂ es . Bar = 20 μ m . b MDA - MB - 231 cells were serum starved for 6 h , then sti - mulated with EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 5 min , then were immuno - stained with Rab34 antibody and actin antibody . It was noted that the endo - genous Rab34 translocates to membrane ruf ﬂ es upon EGF stimulation . Bar = 20 μ m . c The cell lysates derived from MCF7 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were subjected for GST - pulldown assay with GST , GST - ITGB1 - CT , and GST - ITGB3 - CT followed by Western blot , showing Rab34 speci ﬁ cally binds to the cytoplasmic tail of ITGB3 . d MCF7 cells were transfected with GFP - Rab34WT and GFP - Rab34T66N , respectively . Then cells were lysed and the lysates were subjected for GST - pulldown assay with GST , or GST - ITGB3 - CT followed by Western blot , showing ITGB3 prefers to interact with Rab34WT . e , f The cell index re ﬂ ecting cell spreading and adhesion of MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing pSuper . GFP - shRNA - Rab34 or shRNA - Ctrl recorded by RTCA instrument at 60 s interval in real time during 2 h and 24 h from cell seeding , indicating Rab34 knockdown inhibits cell adhesion / spreading of breast cancer cells Rab34 regulates adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells 3701 lamellipodias , unfavorable for migration ( supplemental Fig . 2B ) , and reduced expression of β - catenin and vimentin ( both are EMT markers ) ( supplemental Fig . 2C ) . The cells depleted of Rab34 were examined for invasive ability through matrigel assay . As shown in Fig . 1d , the invaded cells were greatly reduced by two independent shRNA targeting Rab34 . The effects of Rab34 knockdown on cell migration were also investigated by wound healing assay , and the results showed that depletion of Rab34 obviously inhibited the migration activities of both MDA - MB - 231 and BT549 cells ( Fig . 1e ) . To further determine the effect of Rab34 on cell migra - tion / invasion in vivo , we performed tumor xenograft experiments by injecting MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - shRNA - Rab34 into mice through tail vein . After 5 weeks , we observed that cancer cells migrated to lung and develop tumors , which is determined by GFP signals ( Fig . 1f ) , and as expected , Rab34 knockdown sig - ni ﬁ cantly reduced the tumor number in the lung ( Fig . 1g ) . The phenotype that Rab34 knockdown inhibiting breast cancer cell migration and tumorigenesis was validated by another invasive cell line BT549 with Rab34 depleted by shRNA - Rab34 ( Fig . 1h , i ) . The result was consistent with that of in vitro migration / invasion assay , indicating that Rab34 is important for migration / invasion of breast cancer cells , and plays a role in breast cancer metastasis . Rab34 is translocated to membrane ruf ﬂ es upon EGF stimulation Cell surface membrane structure such as membrane ruf ﬂ e is closely related to cell migration and invasion . It is observed that Rab34 can be recruited to membrane ruf ﬂ es upon PDGF stimulation [ 23 ] , thus we examined whether Rab34 is pre - sent in the membrane ruf ﬂ es in breast cancer cells . As shown in Fig . 2a , the majority of over - expressed GFP - Rab34WT is associated with the Golgi apparatus in MCF7 cells , without obvious surface location . However , a pool of GFP - Rab34 was translocated to surface ruf ﬂ e structures marked by actin upon EGF stimulation . As Rab34 is over - expressed in high invasive breast cancer cells , the antibody against Rab34 was used to detect the endogenous Rab34 in MDA - MB - 231 cells , and it was observed that endogenous Rab34 was also translocated to membrane ruf ﬂ es in highly aggressive cells upon EGF stimulation ( Fig . 2b ) . These results suggest that the regulation of Rab34 in cell migration / invasion is prob - ably related to its translocation to membrane ruf ﬂ es . Rab34 interacts with integrin β 3 and regulates cell adhesion To gain insight into the mechanistic aspects of Rab34 in regulating cell migration and invasion , we investigated its interacting partners . The previous studies indicate that Rab proteins usually regulate cancer invasion through modulat - ing integrin traf ﬁ cking [ 30 , 31 ] , we were wondering whe - ther Rab34 interacts with integrin to mediate cell adhesion . To test the interaction of Rab34 with integrins , the cell lysates of MCF7 cells expressing GFP - Rab34 were sub - jected to GST - pulldown experiments using recombinant GST - ITGB1 - CT ( carboxyl terminal tail of integrin β 1 ) or GST - ITGB3 - CT ( carboxyl terminal tail of integrin β 3 ) . The results showed that Rab34 bound to ITGB3 C - terminal tail , but not ITGB1 ( Fig . 2c ) , a negative mutant GFP - Rab34T66N showed weaker binding capacity ( Fig . 2d ) , suggesting the interaction of Rab34 with ITGB3 is likely dependent of its guanine nucleotide binding activity . Since integrins are the key factors for cell adhesion , depletion of Rab34 may affect the cell adhesion . To test this , MDA - MB - 231 cells in suspension were seeded in special plates , and the cell adhesion was monitored in real time by RTCA instrument through recording the cell index , which is increased with cell attachment and spreading . The cell index revealed the increased cell adhesion or spreading with the seeding duration in the chamber , however , cells depleted of Rab34 by shRNA exhibited lower adhesion / spreading ( Fig . 2e , f ) , suggesting Rab34 knockdown inhib - ited adhesion of breast cancer cells . The previous study indicates that maropinocytosis regulates ITGB3 endocytosis [ 32 ] , and membrane ruf ﬂ e is involved in maropinocytosis [ 33 ] . Taken together with membrane ruf ﬂ e association of Rab34 , the results suggest that Rab34 may interact with ITGB3 to regulate cell adhesion of breast cancer cell . Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src Since Rab34 is associated with the membrane ruf ﬂ e upon stimulation and interacts with ITGB3 , we tried to ﬁ gure out how the membrane ruf ﬂ e location of Rab34 is regulated and the physiological relationship between Rab34 and ITGB3 . Rab34 associates with membrane ruf ﬂ e under the condition of EGF stimulation , which results in phosphorylation cas - cade along the downstream signaling factors , thus we tested if Rab34 is phosphorylated . We did not detect signi ﬁ cant phosphorylation of Rab34 in monolayer culture of cells . However , tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 was detected in Hs578T cells when cells re - adhere to the plate from suspension , and the phosphorylation level is increased with the adhesion time during 40 min , then decreased ( Fig . 3a ) . This observation indicates that Rab34 can be tyrosine phosphorylated , and tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is physiologically related to cell adhesion . Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a motif “ NSDDNNL Y LTASKKK ” ( 240 – 254aa ) in Rab34 , which is the optimal substrate consensus sequence for Src kinase family . To test whether Src can phosphorylate Rab34 , myc - 3702 L . Sun et al . Rab34WT ( wild type ) was co - expressed with SrcWT , SrcCA ( constitutive active mutant ) , or SrcDN ( dominant negative mutant ) in MCF7 cells , respectively . Tyrosine phosphorylated Rab34 was immuno - precipitated from the lysate by anti - myc tag antibody , and detected by using anti - phospho - Tyrosine antibody through Western blot . As shown in Fig . 3b , Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by SrcWT and SrcCA , but not SrcDN . Furthermore , a Src kinase inhibitor PP2 strongly inhibited tyrosine phosphor - ylation of Rab34 by SrcWT ( Fig . 3c ) . These results indicate that tyrosine phophorylation of Rab34 is dependent of Src kinase activities . Additionally , Rab34WT or Rab34Q111L ( active form preferring binding to GTP ) can be tyrosine phosphorylated when co - expressed with SrcWT , whereas Rab34T66N ( negative form preferring binding to GDP ) was not be phosphorylated ef ﬁ ciently ( Fig . 3d ) , suggesting that tyr - osine phosphorylation of Rab34 by Src depends on its guanine nucleotide binding activities . Rab34 regulates adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells 3703 The substrate consensus sequence indicates Y247 residue in Rab34 as a candidate phosphorylation site by Src . To test this hypothesis , we mutated this residue into alanine or aspartic acid to generate Rab34Y247A or myc - Rab34Y247D , respectively . Myc - Rab34WT , myc - Rab34Y247A , or myc - Rab34Y247D was co - expressed with SrcCA in MCF7 cells , the proteins were immuno - precipitated from the lysates and detected for tyrosine phosphorylation . As indicated in Fig . 3e , tyrosine phos - phorylation is abolished when Y247 was mutated to alanine or aspartic acid , while a control mutant Rab34Y81D was phosphorylated ef ﬁ ciently . Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 was also con ﬁ rmed by in vitro phosphorylation assay ( supplemental Fig . 2D ) . This result suggests that Y247 residue is likely the phosphorylation site by Src . Src is an important regulator for focal adhesion and membrane ruf ﬂ e formation [ 34 , 35 ] . As mentioned above , EGF - induced membrane ruf ﬂ e location of Rab34 , further examination revealed that serum starvation abolished phosphorylation of Rab34 by Src in MCF7 cells , and EGF stimulation regains phosphorylation of Rab34 by Src ( Fig . 3f ) , indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 by Src is regulated by EGF stimulated signaling pathway . Interestingly , the membrane ruf ﬂ e association of Rab34 is greatly enhanced when GFP - Rab34 was co - expressed with Src ( Fig . 3g ) , while Src knockdown by shRNA - Src inhib - ited Rab34 translocation to the membrane ruf ﬂ e ( Fig . 3h ) . Taken together , Src may mediate Rab34 translocation to plasma membrane through tyrosine phosphorylation . Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 regulates cell migration and invasion Because Rab34 is phosphorylated and localized to mem - brane ruf ﬂ es , which is a feature of migratory cells , we next determined whether phosphorylated Rab34 promotes cell migration and invasion . MCF7 cells , supposed to be less aggressive breast cancer cells , stably expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D ( mimicking the phosphorylated form of Rab34 ) altered the cell morphology to form irregular pro - trusion , which is prone to migration , while Rab34Y247A did not have this effect on the cells ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Western blot experiments revealed that Rab34Y247D decreased the protein levels of tight junction marker occludin , and slightly increased N - cadherin , although without major effects on E - Cadherin ( supplemental Fig . 2E ) , suggesting a role of phosphorylation of Rab34 in EMT . The wound healing experiments also showed that over - expression of GFP - Rab34Y247D enhanced the migration of both MCF7 cells or MDA - MB - 231 cells , while Rab34Y247A had no effects on MCF7 cell , but slightly inhibited migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 4c , d ) . A matrigel invasion assay was further used to examine cell invasion activity . As shown in Fig . 4e , f , GFP - Rab34Y247D signi ﬁ cantly increased the cell number of invaded MDA - MB - 231 cells , while Rab34Y247A inhibited cell invasion . Nude mice was injected with MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D or GFP - Rab34Y247A through tail vein . After 5 weeks of injection , it is observed that Rab34Y247D signi ﬁ cantly promoted cancer cells migrated to the lung and tumor development . Inter - estingly , Rab34Y247A signi ﬁ cantly inhibited migration ( Fig . 4g , h ) , consistent with the results from wound healing experiments . Taken together , our results suggest that tyr - osine phosphorylation of Rab34 promotes cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and metastatic property in vivo . Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 regulates cell adhesion of breast cancer cells As mentioned previously , tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is related to cell adhesion ( Fig . 3a ) , an additional experiment further supports the notion . Tyrosine phos - phorylation of Rab34 in Hs578T cells was enhanced when Fig . 3 Src phosphorylates Rab34 in dependent of cell adhesion . a Hs578t cells in suspension were plated on dishes for the indicated time , then the cells were harvested and processed for immunopreci - pitation with Rab34 antibody , followed by Western blot with indicated antibodies , showing Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated during cell adhesion . b MCF7 cells were co - transfected with myc - Rab34 and SrcWT , SrcCA , or SrcDN ) , then the cells were processed for co - immunoprecipitation with α - myc tag antibody , followed by Western blot with indicated antibodies , showing Rab34 is tyrosine phos - phorylated by SrcWT and SrcCA . c MCF7 cells transfected with srcWT and myc - Rab34WT were treated with Src inhibitor PP2 ( 4 µM ) and FAK inhibitor ( 50 µM ) for 2 h , then the cells were processed for detecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 and other indicated proteins , showing PP2 inhibits trosine phosphorylation of Rab34 . d MCF7 cells were co - transfected with SrcWT and myc - Rab34WT , myc - Rab34T66N , or myc - Rab34Q111L , respectively , then the cells were processed for detecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 , showing tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is dependent of its gua - nine nucleotide binding activity . e MCF7 cells were transfected with SrcCA and myc - tagged various mutants of Rab34 ( tyrosine substituted by alanine to mimic non - phosphorylated status or aspartate to mimic phosphorylated status ) , then the cells were processed for detecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 , demonstrating Y247 is essential for phosphorylation by Src . f MCF7 cells transiently co - transfected with SrcWT and myc - Rab34WT were starved for 6 h then stimulated with EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 10 min . The cells were processed for detecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 , indicating EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 by Src . g MCF7 cells transfected with GFP - Rab34WT and SrcWT were starved for 6 h and then stimulated with EGF for 5 min to induce membrane ruf ﬂ ing , followed by immuno - staining with Src antibody . Fluorescence microscopy showed Src enhances membrane ruf ﬂ e association of Rab34 . h MCF7 cells co - transfected with shRNA - Src and myc - Rab34WT were starved for 6 h and then treated with EGF for 5 min . It is noted that Src knockdown inhibits Rab34 association with mem - brane ruf ﬂ es 3704 L . Sun et al . Fig . 4 Rab34Y247D promotes cell migration and invasion . a , b MCF7 cells stably expressing the indicated constructs have altered cell morphology ( a ) , the cells at the wound edge form irregular protrusions ( b ) , which is prone to migration . c The wound healing assay revealed that MCF7 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D migrate faster than the cells expressing GFP - vector or GFP - Rab34Y247A . d The wound healing assay revealed that Rab34Y247D promotes cell migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D , while Rab34Y247D slightly inhibits migration . e MDA - MB231 cells were transfected with GFP - Vector , GFP - Rab34Y247A , or GFP - Rab34Y247D . The invasion assay revealed that Rab34Y247D enhances cell invasion , but Rab34Y247A slightly inhibits invasion . f The invaded cell number was measured with imageJ software from three independent experiments . g Cancer metastasis experiments carried out by injection of MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D or GFP - Rab34Y247A into mice through lateral tail vein , and metastasis was investigated by examing the tumorigenesis in lung tissues . The GFP - ﬂ uorescent tumors were observed under ﬂ uorescence microscope . h Quantitative analysis of the result g from ﬁ ve independent experiments by Student ’ s t - test Rab34 regulates adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells 3705 cells re - adhere from suspension , and the phosphorylation was inhibited by Src kinase inhibitor PP2 ( Fig . 5a ) . Next we examined the effects of over - expression of Src on tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 during cell adhesion . MCF7 cells were co - transfected with myc - Rab34 and SrcCA , and cells in 80 % con ﬂ uence were trypsinized and incubated in sus - pension for a different time course , then myc - Rab34 was immuno - precipitated and processed for detecting tyrosine phosphorylation . Interestingly , Rab34 was not phosphory - lated in suspension culture even if co - expressed with SrcCA ( Fig . 5b ) . However , phosphorylation of Rab34 increased when the cells were re - plated for adhesion culture ( Fig . 5c ) . The data suggest that Src - mediated Rab34 phosphorylation is involved in cell adhesion . To determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 in cell adhesion , MDA - MB - 231 cells stably Fig . 5 Phosphorylated Rab34 contributes to cell adhesion . a Hs578t cells in suspension were pre - treated with or without PP2 for 1 h and re - plated on dishes with or without PP2 for 40 min , respectively . The cells were harvested and processed for detecting tyrosine phosphor - ylation of Rab34 , the results demonstrated that Src inhibitor PP2 abolished phosphorylation of Rab34 during adhesion . b MCF7 cells transfected with SrcCA and Rab34WT were trypsinized , after wash - ing , the cells were incubated in suspension for the indicated times . The cells were harvested and processed for detecting tyrosine phosphor - ylation of Rab34 , the results demonstrated that Rab34 is not phos - phorylated in cells in suspension . c MCF7 cells transfected with SrcCA and Rab34WT were trypsinized and re - plated on dishes to allow cell adhesion for indicated time above . The cells were harvested and processed for detecting tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 , the results demonstrated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is increased with cell adhesion . d A real - time monitoring the spreading and adhesion of MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - Vector , GFP - Rab34Y247A , or GFP - Rab34Y247D by RTCA instrument at 60 s interval for 24 h , indicating Rab34Y247 promotes cell adhesion , while Rab34Y247A inhibits cell adhesion . e MDA - MB - 231 cells transfected with GFP - Rab34Y247D were trypsinized and re - plated on dishes . Cells were ﬁ xed at indicated time and processed for immuno - staining with actin antibody . Immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy revealed Rab34Y247D associates with actin at plasma membrane and promotes cell spreading and adhesion 3706 L . Sun et al . expressing GFP - Vector , GFP - Rab34Y247D , or GFP - Rab34Y247A were subjected for monitoring the cell adhesion and spreading in real time as mentioned pre - viously . Consistently , Rab34Y247D , the mutant mimicking phosphorylated Rab34 promoted cell adhesion , but the non - phosphorylated mutant Rab34Y247A inhibited cell adhesion ( Fig . 5d ) . From an immuno ﬂ uorescence micro - scopy analysis , it was observed that MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing GFP - Rab34 - Y247D adhere and spread faster than non - transfected cells , especially at 15 min and 30 min adhesion time points , the cells expressing Rab34Y247D was obviously spreading better than control cells , in Rab34 regulates adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells 3707 addition , much of Rab34 was associated with the membrane ruf ﬂ e structures marked by actin during cell adhesion ( Fig . 5e ) . It was also observed that Rab34Y247D induced focal adhesion at cell surface in MCF7 cells as marked by labeling FAK , but Rab34Y247A did not ( supplemental Fig . 3A ) , suggesting tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 may participate in focal adhesion formation . Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 mediates endocytosis and recycling of integrin β 3 Integrins are important adhesion molecules , and a previous investigation demonstrated that internalization of ITGB3 is regulated by macropinocytosis [ 32 ] . As Rab34 is involved in the formation of macropinosome [ 23 ] , and Src can interact with ITGB3 [ 36 ] , in the context thatRab34 interacts with ITGB3 and its tyrosine phosphorylation by Src , we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 mediates ITGB3 endocytosis , sorting , recycling , or degradation . For the examination of endocytosis of ITGB3 , MCF7 cells co - expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D and HA - ITGB3 were starved , and biotin - labeled for surface proteins , after washing , the cells were processed for internalization of surface proteins under EGF stimulation for the indicated time . After stripping away the Biotin attached to non - endocytosed surface proteins , the amount of a biotinylated surface protein represents that of endocytosed ( therefore protected from surface stripping ) . Biotinylated ITGB3 was captured by streptavidin agarose and detected through Western blot . As shown in Fig . 6a , Rab34Y247D sig - ni ﬁ cantly enhanced the internalization of HA - ITGB3 as compared with control vector . An additional experiment revealed that the non - phosphorylated mutant Rab34Y247A inhibited ITGB3 internalization ( Fig . 6b ) . Immuno - ﬂ uorescence microscopy showed that Rab34Y247D is associated with ITGB3 at the plasma membrane and macropinosome - like structure ( supplemental Fig . 3B ) . Together with membrane ruf ﬂ e association of Rab34 , the results suggest tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 may mediate ITGB3 endocytosis via macropinocytosis . We examined the protein levels of ITGB1 and ITGB3 in MDA - MB231 cells expressing shRNA - Rab34 . As shown in Fig . 6c , d , Rab34 knockdown speci ﬁ cally decreases the level of ITGB3 , but had no effects on ITGB1 , which was con - ﬁ rmed by another independent shRNA targeting Rab34 , suggesting depletion of Rab34 promotes ITGB3 degrada - tion . In addition , over - expression of Rab34Y247D sig - ni ﬁ cantly sustained HA - ITGB3 protein level in MDA - MB231 cells after EGF treatment for 6 h ( supplemental Fig . 4A ) . These results suggest that Rab34 may prevent ITGB3 degradation , and / or enhance ITGB3 recycling back to the plasma membrane . As Rab34 knockdown resulted in degradation of ITGB3 and over - expressing Rab34Y247D inhibited ITGB3 degra - dation , we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylated Rab34 can promote ITGB3 recycling . MCF7 cells were co - transfected with HA - ITGB3 and GFP - Rab34Y247D or Rab34Y247A , after starvation for 6 h , the cells were pro - cessed for endocytosis in the presence of cycloheximide and EGF for 6 h , a longer time to ensure proteins recycling back to the surface . HA - ITGB3 was detected by Western blot . As revealed in Fig . 6e , much of ITGB3 was degraded , how - ever , Rab34Y247D signi ﬁ cantly sustained more ITGB3 as compared with Rab34Y247A ( Fig . 6f ) , suggesting tyrosine phosphorylated Rab34 may promote ITGB3 recycling . Furthermore , HA - ITGB3 , myc - Rab34 , and GFP - Rab4a ( a key Rab protein mediating recycling pathway ) co - expressed in cells , the degradation of ITGB3 is greatly inhibited . Rab34Y247D enhanced ITGB3 recycling ( Fig . 6g , h ) , but Rab34Y247 A had no major effects , suggesting tyrosine phosphorylated Rab34 may cooperate with Rab4a to pro - mote rapid recycling of ITGB3 . Western blot analysis revealed that the high invasive cell lines have higher expression level of ITGB3 ( supplemental Fig . 4B ) , which is correlative with the expression of Rab34 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy showed that MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab34Y247D had more Fig . 6 Rab34 phosphorylation contributes to accumulation of inter - nalized ITGB3 . a MCF7 cells were transfected with HA - ITGB3 and GFP - Vector or GFP - Rab34Y247D , and induced by EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for endocytosis of biotin - labeled surface proteins . The internalized biotin - labeled surface proteins were captured by streptavidin and detected through Western blot . The data indicated that Rab34Y247D promotes accumulation of internalized ITGB3 . b MCF7 cells were co - transfected with HA - ITGB3 and GFP - Vector , GFP - Rab34WT , GFP - Rab34Y247A , or GFP - Rab34Y247D , respectively . Cells were induced for endocytosis and processed for detecting the internalization of ITGB3 as described in a , indicating Rab34Y247A inhibits the endo - cytosis of ITGB3 . c MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing pSuper . GFP - shRNA - Rab34 or shRNA - Ctrl were lysed and the lysates were subjected for Western blot assay to analyze the protein level of ITGB3 and ITGB1 , showing two independent shRNAs targeting Rab34 decrease the protein levels of ITGB3 . d Quantitative analysis from c showing the relative protein level normalized to β - tubulin . e MCF7 cells were co - transfected with HA - ITGB3 and GFP - Rab34Y247A or GFP - Rab34Y247D , respectively . Cells were starved for 3 h and then cultured in DMEM medium in the presence of cycloheximide ( 50 μ g / ml ) and EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 6 h to allow ITGB3 internalization , degradation , and recycling . HA - ITGB3 was detected through Western blot . f Quantitative analysis of HA - ITGB3 level from e normalized to the mount of GAPDH from three independent experiments indicated that Rab34Y247D may stabilize ITGB3 . g MCF7 cells were co - transfected with HA - ITGB3 and GFP - Rab4a , together with the indi - cated plasmids , respectively . Cells were starved for 3 h and then cul - tured in DMEM medium in the presence of cycloheximide ( 50 μ g / ml ) and EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) for 6 h . HA - ITGB3 was detected through Western blot . h Quantitative analysis of HA - ITGB3 level from g , normalized to the mount of GAPDH from three independent experi - ments indicated that Rab34Y247D may enhance Rab4a - dependent stabilization of ITGB3 3708 L . Sun et al . obvious lamellipodias and adhesion structures labeled by anti - intergrin α v β 3 antibody at the leading edge than cells expressing GFP - Rab34Y247A ( Fig . 7a ) . Taken together , the results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 may mediate ITGB3 recycling back to the leading edge to form adhesion complex , which is required for cell migration and invasion . Discussion Alterations of membrane traf ﬁ cking are involved in malig - nancy , and components of membrane traf ﬁ cking machi - neries such as Rab proteins can serve as novel biomarkers and the potential targets for cancer therapy [ 37 , 38 ] . In this work , we found that Rab34 is over - expressed in highly aggressive breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB - 231 , BT549 , and Hs578t ) and metastatic breast cancer tissues . Rab34 reg - ulates cell adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells , suggesting Rab34 is a novel regulator and potential biomarker for aggressive breast Rab34 is a Golgi - associated GTPase participating in secretion and distribution of lysosomes [ 20 , 22 ] . It is also observed that Rab34 was implicated in membrane ruf ﬂ ing and formation of macropinosome [ 23 ] . Here we indepen - dently showed that Rab34 can be recruited to membrane ruf ﬂ es in response to EGF - induced signaling and cell adhesion . Non - receptor tyrosine kinase Src is associated with the endosomes , and can be recruited to the plasma membrane by the activated integrin [ 36 , 39 ] . The endo - somes is emerging as a platform for integrin - mediated sig - naling of some kinase such as FAK [ 40 , 41 ] . Our results showed that Rab34 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β 3 , and is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src , suggesting tyr - osine phosphorylation of Rab34 by Src is important for its recruitment to the membrane ruf ﬂ es to regulate integrin β 3 traf ﬁ cking and surface level . Rab proteins regulate cancer cell migration / invasion usually through modulating surface protein internalization , Fig . 7 Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 enhances recycling of integrin α v β 3 to the plasma membrane . a MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab34Y247A or GFP - Rab34Y247D were immuno - stained with integrin α v β 3 antibody . Fluorescence microscopy revealed Rab34Y247D promotes integrin α v β 3 localization to the leading edge . Arrowheads indicate integrin α v β 3 at the leading edge . b A proposed model for Rab34 in regulating cell adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells . In this model , Integrin β 3 is internalized to the endosomes upon stimulation , where Integrin β 3 activates Src and interacts with Rab34 , and the activated Src can therefore phosphorylates Rab34 , the phosphorylated Rab34 will probably inhibit the lysosomal degradation of ITGB3 , but cooperate with Src to mediate rapid recycling of ITGB3 back to plasma membrane to form new adhesion to regulate cell migration and invasion Rab34 regulates adhesion , migration , and invasion of breast cancer cells 3709 degradation , and recycling [ 42 , 43 ] . For example , both Rab25 and Rab21 mediate integrin β 1 endocytosis and recycling [ 12 , 44 ] . Rab34 modulates cancer cell migration / invasion through a novel mechanism by mediating integrin β 3 traf ﬁ cking . Cell migration relies on membrane pseudopodia which offers force and direction , together with focal adhesion which interacts with micro ﬁ laments , driving cell migration [ 45 , 46 ] . Cell adhesion is mainly assembled by complex of integrin α and integrin β subunits , such as integrin α 5 β 1and integrin α v β 3 complexes , which serve as the platform to recruit other adhesion factors including Src and FAK kinases [ 47 , 48 ] . Cell migration depends on adhesion complex turnover including internalization of integrin and its rapid recycling back to plasma membrane to form new adhesion [ 46 , 49 ] . Especially , endocytosis of integrin β 3 is mediated by macropinocytosis , and integrin β 3 interacts with Src kinase [ 32 , 36 ] . Our works found that Rab34 associates at membrane ruf ﬂ es upon EGF stimulation , and interacts with integrin β 3 , Rab34 knockdown promotes integrin β 3 degradation and inhibits migration , adhesion , and invasion of breast cancer cells . More importantly , Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src , and tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 speci ﬁ cally occurs during cell adhesion process , and consequently regulates cell adhesion , migration , and invasion . Furthermore , tyrosine phosphor - ylation of Rab34 promotes integrin β 3 internaliztion and enhances its rapid recycling . In addition , highly invasive MDA - MB - 231 , BT549 , and Hs578T breast cancer cells have elevated levels of activated Src , activated FAK , and higher expression of ITGB3 , which is consistent with the higher expressions of Rab34 in these cells . Collectively , we propose a working model in that Rab34 can interact with integrin β 3 and target to the endosomal compartments , where integrin β 3 activates Src which con - sequently phosphorylates Rab34 , the phosphorylated Rab34 will probably inhibit the lysosomal degradation of integrin β 3 , by cooperating with Src to promote integrin β 3 rapid recycling back to the plasma membrane , facilitating new adhesion formation and modulating cell migration ( Fig . 7b ) . Although the exact mechanism needs to be further vali - dated , our results collectively support this hypothesis that signalling pathways will enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 which will consequently promotes dynamic recycling of integrin β 3 to promote cell migration . High invasive breast cancer cells usually belong to the type of the triple negative ( ER , PR , and Her2 negative ) breast cancer ( TNBC ) cells , with higher potential of migration and invasion than other breast cancer cells , so that TNBC patients often suffer from the crisis of distal metas - tasis [ 50 , 51 ] . TNBC cells do not express estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , or Her2 receptor , resulting in the resistance to most chemotherapies targeting the proteins [ 52 ] . Our results revealed that Rab34 is speci ﬁ cally over - expressed in high invasive TNBC cell lines ( MDA - MB - 231 , BT549 , and Hs578T ) , suggesting Rab34 may be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of TNBC . Rab34 was also found in glioma , and its expression is correlated with the poor prognosis and higher mortality rate in glioma cases [ 27 ] . An intrinsic question is how the expression of Rab34 regulated in cancer , it is reported that the expression of RAB 34 gene is regulated by microRNA miR - 433 in prostate cancer [ 53 ] . Future investigations on the roles of Rab34 in other types of cancer , as well as the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of Rab34 in regulating different cancers will provide additional insights into Rab34 as a new biomarker and therapeutic target for different types of cancers .
