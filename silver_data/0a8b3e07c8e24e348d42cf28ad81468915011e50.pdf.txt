First published June 14 , 2005 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajprenal . 00178 . 2005 . —The docking protein CD2AP ( CD2 - associated protein ) serves a nonredundant function in podocytes as CD2AP knockout mice die of renal failure at the age of 6 – 7 wk . Furthermore , haploinsufﬁciency due to mutation of the CD2AP gene is associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in humans . Although CD2AP has been shown to interact with proteins regulating actin polymerization , with proteins of the slit diaphragm , and with the endocytic machinery , its critical function in podocytes remains unclear . In conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes , we demonstrate that CD2AP colocalizes with cortactin and F - actin in spots of (cid:1) 0 . 5 - (cid:1) m diameter . Confocal time - lapse microscopy in living podocytes expressing GFP - CD2AP or GFP - actin revealed that spots are motile , possess a limited lifetime , and are frequently associated with vesicles . A signiﬁcant portion of spot - associated vesicles belongs to a later endosomal - sorting compartment , characterized by delayed uptake of ﬂuorescent dextran ( 10 kDa ) and by colocalization with Rab4 , but not Rab5 and AP - 2 . Rapid accumulation of microinjected G - actin in spots and abrogation of spot motility by jasplakinolide demonstrate that spot movements depend on actin polymerization . Furthermore , a high turnover ( half - time (cid:2) 10 s ) of CD2AP in spots was demonstrated by FRAP ( ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleach - ing ) . Our results demonstrate that CD2AP is associated with dynamic actin in a speciﬁc late endosomal compartment in podocytes , suggest - ing that CD2AP might be crucially involved in endosomal sorting and / or trafﬁcking via regulation of actin assembly on vesicles . glomerular epithelial cells ; CMS ; green ﬂuorescent protein CD 2 AP ( CD2 - associated protein ) / CMS is an 80 - kDa adaptor protein containing three SH3 domains in its NH 2 terminus , a proline - rich region and a COOH - terminal coiled - coil domain with a putative (cid:3) - thymosin - like actin binding site ( 7 ) . Because it has been discovered that CD2AP - deﬁcient mice die at the age of 6 to 7 wk because of progressive glomerulosclerosis and massive proteinuria ( 31 ) , many binding partners and biochem - ical features of CD2AP have been studied , including molecules involved in actin assembly and signaling pathways ( 11 , 17 , 18 , 27 , 41 ) , proteins of the slit diaphragm complex in podocytes ( 30 , 31 ) , and interactions with the endocytic machinery of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor and ferritin ( 4 , 16 , 21 ) . However , the exact role of CD2AP in renal podocytes that prevents lethal glomerular disease still remains unclear . In our previous work , we showed that CD2AP localizes to podocytes in mouse glomeruli where it is present in foot processes and podocyte cell bodies . Moreover , we used cul - tured podocytes to discover colocalization of CD2AP with F - actin spots that also stained positive for the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin ( 41 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex , which mediates initiation of new actin ﬁlaments and branches on preexisting ﬁlaments , is regulated by WASp / Scar proteins and cortactin , which binds and activates Arp2 / 3 complex ( 12 , 22 , 37 , 39 , 40 , 42 ) . Actin ﬁlament growth and turnover are essen - tial for cell motility and intracellular motility of bacteria , viruses , and endogenous vesicles ( 25 ) . In PtK1 cells that overexpress an activated form of the small GTPase ARF6 , Schafer et al . ( 27 ) observed dynamic actin spots with comet tails , some of which were associated with vesicles . CD2AP localized to the head domain of these actin comet tails . Recently , CD2AP was found to colocalize with the EGF receptor and cortactin in EGF - induced membrane rufﬂes in HeLa cells and to form a complex with receptor bound Cbl and endophilin , which is a regulatory component of clathrin - coated vesicles ( 21 ) . Similarly , recent studies ( 10 , 33 ) have demon - strated a role for the Cbl interacting protein of 85 kDa ( CIN85 ) in a complex with endophilins and Cbl , in receptor - mediated endocytosis . In this complex , the CIN85 SH3 domains bind to receptor - associated Cbl , whereas a speciﬁc proline - rich motif in CIN85 binds endophilin . Because of signiﬁcant homology in molecular architecture , sequence , and interacting partners ( p130Cas , Grb2 , Cbl , PI3 - kinase ) , CD2AP and CIN85 repre - sent a common adaptor molecule family ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 17 , 35 , 38 ) . Compared with the molecular composition of CD2AP , how - ever , CIN85 lacks an actin - binding domain ( 20 ) . The regula - tory impact of CD2AP is not restricted to the degradative pathway of the EGF receptor . CD2AP in a complex with Cbl was also shown to inﬂuence VEGF receptor ( Flt - 1 ) internal - ization ( 19 ) . Also , haploinsufﬁciency of CD2AP results in impaired formation of prelysosomal multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) in podocytes in response to intravenous ferritin injec - tion compared with wild - type mice ( 16 ) . Interestingly , CD2AP also binds the small GTPase Rab4 , and by interaction with active Rab4 and Cbl controls morphology of EEA1 - positve early endosomes . Coexpression of Rab4 and CD2AP in CHO cells resulted in enlarged vesicles that were positive for the late endosome marker Rab7 ( 4 ) . However , the relationship between CD2AP and the endosomal compartment has not yet been explored in podocytes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Podocyte cell culture . Cultivation of conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes was performed as previously reported ( 29 ) .

To propagate podocytes , cells were ﬁrst cultivated at 33°C and maintained for at least 1 wk at 38°C to induce differentiation . Immunoﬂuorescence , confocal laser - scanning microscopy , and mi - croinjection . For immunoﬂuorescence studies , podocytes were cul - tured on type IV collagen - coated glass coverslips ( Biochrom , Berlin , Germany ) . At room temperature , cells were ﬁxed ( 2 % paraformalde - hyde in PBS ) for 10 min , permeabilized ( 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) for 8 min , and blocked in blocking solution ( 2 % FBS , 2 % BSA , 0 . 2 % gelatine , PBS ) for 45 min . Primary antibodies were incubated for 60 min . The following antibodies were used : rabbit anti - CD2AP and anti - Rab4 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Heidelberg , Germany ) , mouse anti - cortactin ( 4F11 , Upstate Biotechnology , Waltham , MA ) , rabbit anti - AP - 2 ( kindly provided by Dr . E . Ungewickell , Hannover , Ger - many ) . Antigen - antibody complexes were visualized with Cy2 - or Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) . For double - staining of CD2AP and cortactin , both secondary antibodies were from the same host ( goat ) and preadsorbed to avoid cross reactivity . F - actin was visualized using ﬂuorochrome ( Alexa ) - conjugated phalloi - dins ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Coverslips were washed ( PBS ) , rinsed ( H 2 O ) , and mounted with 15 % Mowiol ( Calbiochem ) , 50 % glycerol , PBS . Specimens were viewed with a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( TCS - SP , Leica Microsystems , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Fig . 1 . Colocalization of CD2AP with F - actin and cortactin in spots . The podocyte staining pattern for CD2AP shows multiple spots that colocalize with F - actin spots ( a - c ) . Moreover , CD2AP and cortactin colocalize to identical spots in podocytes as shown by double staining ( d - i ) . In contrast to CD2AP , cortactin is more strongly expressed at cell margins .

Alexa488 - conjugated rabbit G - actin ( 3 . 6 (cid:1) g / (cid:1) l , Molecular Probes ) was injected into cultured podo - cytes in RPMI - 1640 without carbonate using the Eppendorf Femtojet . Injection pressure and injection time were 150 hPa and 0 . 4 s , respec - tively . After 1 to 8 min , cells were ﬁxed and prepared for immuno - histochemistry as described above . Plasmids and transfection . Expression vectors coding for the fol - lowing ﬂuorescent fusion proteins were employed : green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - (cid:3) - actin ( BD Biosciences , Heidelberg , Germany ) , GFP - CD2AP , CFP - Rab4A , and CFP - Rab5A . Cells were transfected using PerFectin reagent ( Peqlab , Erlangen , Germany ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Transiently transfected cells were taken for experiments 1 – 3 days after transfection . Dextran incubation . Cultured podocytes on coverslips were incu - bated in RPMI - 1640 containing 10 % FBS and 1 mg / ml Alexa546 - conjugated dextran ( 10 kDa , Molecular Probes ) for 30 min , 2 h , or 20 h . Cells were then washed brieﬂy with PBS and mounted in the chamber for live cell microscopy . Live cell microscopy and photobleaching . A custom - built Plexiglas chamber was ﬁlled with 400 (cid:1) l of observation medium ( RPMI - 1640 w / o phenol red supplemented with 10 % FBS ) . Cell - containing cov - erslips coated with mouse collagen IV ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ; BD Biosciences ) were attached to the bottom of the chamber . The chamber was sealed and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope ( IRBE , Leica Microsystems ) . The temperature of the chamber and of the objective was kept at 37°C with the aid of an airstream incubator ( ASI 400 , Nevtek , Burnsville , VA ) . Immersion objectives ( (cid:4) 63 , numerical ap - erture 1 . 32 ) were used and images were obtained by confocal laser - scanning microscopy ( TCS - SP , Leica Microsystems ) . Images ( 512 (cid:4) 512 pixel ) with a resolution of 12 . 9 pixel / (cid:1) m were collected in 5 - to 30 - s intervals . The 488 - nm laser line was used for GFP visualization as well as for bleaching . The bleaching pattern was generated by repetitive ( 8 times ) scanning of a square ( 100 (cid:4) 100 pixel ) . For FRAP analysis , images were collected every 4 . 8 s after bleaching . Applied laser intensity for bleaching was about 400 - fold higher than the intensity used for imaging . Jasplakinolide ( Molecular Probes ) was injected into the chamber in a small volume of 3 (cid:1) l to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 (cid:1) M . Live cell observations were completed within 1 h after attachment of the coverslip to the chamber . Transmission electron microscopy . Cells were ﬁxed with 2 % para - formaldehyde for 30 min , permeabilized , blocked , and incubated with rabbit anti - CD2AP for 1 h . The speciman was rinsed with washing buffer ( PBS containing 0 . 1 % BSA ) and exposed to goat anti - rabbit IgG coupled to 10 - nm colloidal gold ( Sigma ) fo r 1 h atroom temperature . Cells were then washed and postﬁxed with 2 % glutaral - dehyde and 0 . 5 % tannic acid and counterstained with 2 % OsO 4 in PBS , treated with 2 % uranyl acetate for 2 – 5 min and ﬁnally with 0 . 003 % lead citrate in 2 % polyvinyl alcohol ( Sigma ) . The specimens were observed under a Phillips EM 301 electron microscope . Image processing and data analysis . Image processing for FRAP analysis and video export was done with ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . In FRAP analysis , ﬂuorescence intensities over time were ﬁtted to a monoexponential recovery function using Fig . 2 . Green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - actin and GFP - CD2AP accumulate in spots containing CD2AP , cortactin , and F - actin . GFP - actin spots colocalize with CD2AP and cortactin , while stress ﬁbers exhibit no overlap with CD2AP or cortactin ( a , b ) . Furthermore , F - actin staining with phalloidin is identical with GFP - actin ( c ) . Similarly , GFP - CD2AP colocalizes with cortactin and F - actin in spots ( e , f ) and assumes a distribution identical to endogenous CD2AP visualized by an anti - CD2AP antibody ( d ) .

Results are presented as means (cid:5) SE if not indicated otherwise . RESULTS As we have reported recently ( 41 ) , CD2AP localizes to characteristic spots of (cid:6) 0 . 5 - (cid:1) m size that strictly colocalize with F - actin ( Fig . 1 , a - c ) . Having shown that both cortactin which is known to be an activator of Arp2 / 3 complex as well as the Arp2 / 3 complex itself colocalize with F - actin spots in podocytes ( 41 ) , we now demonstrate by confocal microscopy that cortactin directly colocalizes with CD2AP in spots . Be - sides a diffuse perinuclear distribution , CD2AP localized to characteristic cytoplasmic spots . Cortactin resembled the CD2AP spot - like pattern but was also found at cell margins ( Fig . 1 , d - f ) . High - power magniﬁcation revealed that CD2AP and cortactin exactly colocalized to the same spots ( Fig . 1 , g - i ) . Cross reactivity of secondary antibodies with the primary IgGs was unlikely because of the selective staining of cell margins by cortactin , and it was further excluded by control stainings ( data not shown ) . To evaluate the characteristics of these spots in living podocytes , we transfected cultured podocytes with expression vectors coding for GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP . We next performed colocalization studies to demonstrate an identical localization of GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP as the endog - enously expressed proteins actin and CD2AP . GFP - actin colo - calized with CD2AP and cortactin in spots ( Fig . 2 , a and b ) . Moreover , the stainings of endogenous F - actin with ﬂuoro - chrome - coupled phalloidin and GFP - actin were identical ( Fig . 2 c ) . In parallel to those ﬁndings , GFP - CD2AP colocalized to cortactin and F - actin spots but not to stress ﬁbers ( Fig . 2 , e and f ) and its staining pattern showed a full overlap with the CD2AP antibody ( Fig . 2 d ) . Visualization of GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP by confocal microscopy in living podocytes revealed that spots are highly motile performing nondirectional movements and that spots possess a limited lifetime that ranges from seconds to minutes ( Fig . 3 , a - d ) . Occasionally , dynamic spots formed comet tails ( arrow in Fig . 3 d ) . In addition to spots that were not associated with any obvious intracellular structure , we observed many spots that seemed to be linked to vesicular structures being visible as dark circular areas ( DCAs ) because of absent cytosolic green ﬂuo - rescence [ Fig . 4 ; videos 1 and 2 ( all supplemental data for this study are available at http : / / ajprenal . physiology . org / cgi / con - tent / full / 00178 . 2005 / DC1 ) ] . To conﬁrm the vesicular nature of the observed DCAs , GFP - CD2AP - transfected podocytes were incubated with Alexa546 - conjugated dextran ( 10 kDa ) for different time periods , washed , and chased with confocal time lapse imaging for 10 to 30 min [ Fig . 5 , a and b ; videos 3 and 4 ( supplemental data ) ] . As indicated by z - scans of living cells , Fig . 3 . GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP spots are motile and possess a limited lifetime . Living podocytes expressing GFP - actin or GFP - CD2AP were observed by confocal time - lapse microscopy . Actin spots were not associated with stress ﬁbers and were highly motile with limited lifetimes ( a , b ) . GFP - CD2AP was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm , but CD2AP spots were clearly demarcated ( c ) . CD2AP spots were transient and highly dynamic . Occasionally , comet tails were observed on moving spots ( d , arrow at 45 s ) . Image width is 40 (cid:1) m ( a ) , 15 (cid:1) m ( c ) and 5 (cid:1) m ( b , d ) .

Moreover , the absence of persistent extracellular dextran on z - scan images excludes DCAs from being basal or apical invaginations of the podocyte cell mem - brane but account for a vesicular nature . The uptake of the endocytic ﬂuid phase marker dextran in DCAs was time dependent . While 29 (cid:5) 9 % ( n (cid:7) 6 cells ) of DCAs were loaded by dextran after a 30 - min incubation period , 76 (cid:5) 8 % of DCAs were loaded with dextran after prolonged exposure for 20 h ( n (cid:7) 6 cells ; Fig . 5 d ) . Overall , 32 (cid:5) 4 % ( n (cid:7) 6 cells ) of the total number of CD2AP spots were clearly associated with dextran - loaded DCAs after 2 - h incubation . Correlated with the increase in dextran - loaded DCAs , there was an increase in dextran - loaded DCAs associated with CD2AP spots after 2 h compared with incubation for 30 min . After 2 - h incubation , 61 (cid:5) 9 % ( n (cid:7) 6 cells ) of dextran - loaded DCAs were associ - ated with CD2AP spots ( Fig . 5 d ) . DCAs , however , do not account for all vesicular compartments in GFP - CD2AP ex - pressing podocytes . The maximum of all dextran - ﬁlled vesicles that were visible as DCAs was calculated to 26 (cid:5) 5 % ( n (cid:7) 6 cells ) at 20 h . Thus the majority of dextran vesicles could not be associated with DCAs , which indicates that DCAs are a distinct subtype of the vesicular compartments . Conversely , not all CD2AP spots were associated with dextran - labeled vesicles , suggesting association with other ( vesicular ) struc - tures . Interestingly , the intracellular localization and size of dextran - ﬁlled DCAs varied grossly ( from 0 . 3 - to 3 - (cid:1) m diam - eter ) . Larger DCAs tended to predominate at perinuclear sites while smaller DCAs more often occurred in the cell periphery ( Fig . 5 , a and b ) . Of note is that the ﬂuid phase marker dextran is often inhomogenously distributed in DCAs , which pro - poses an internal membranous suborganization in some DCAs ( Fig . 5 b ) . Fig . 4 . GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP spots are associated with vesicles . Many GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP spots were associated with dark circular areas ( DCAs , arrows ) , which represent vesicles as shown later ( video 1 and 2 ; supplemental data ) . DCAs were visible because of the absence of cytoplasmic GFP fusion proteins . Image width is 30 (cid:1) m ( a , c ) and 10 (cid:1) m ( b , d ) . Fig . 5 . CD2AP spots are associated with dextran - loaded vesicles . To conﬁrm the vesicular nature of DCAs , GFP - CD2AP - expressing podocytes were incubated with ﬂuorescent dextran for 0 . 5 h , 2 h and 20 h , washed and chased with confocal time - lapse microscopy ( video 3 and 4 ) . The intracellular localization and size ( 0 . 3 to 3 (cid:1) m ) of dextran - loaded vesicles varied ( a and b , arrows ) . Often , dextran was inhomogeneously distributed in vesicles ( b , arrow ) . Z - scans of living cells con - ﬁrmed the intracellular localization of dextran - ﬁlled vesicles ( c ) . Uptake of dextran in DCAs was time dependent ( d , open bars ) with a maximal uptake of 76 (cid:5) 8 % at 20 h .

Second , CD2AP spots are linked to vesicles in the endocytic pathway . This was also analyzed by immunoelectron microscopy of cultured podocytes , conﬁrming the close association of CD2AP with vesicles in nontransfected cells ( Fig . 6 a , arrow ) . Furthermore , we noted that association of spots was also detectable by immunoﬂuorescence in non - transfected podocytes ( see Fig . 1 b , inset ) . However , DCAs can be detected more easily in GFP - actin - or GFP - CD2AP - trans - fected cells because of the higher cytosolic background ﬂuo - rescence . Using CFP - Rab4 , which labels sorting endosomes , we found that nearly all Rab4 - positive vesicles were decorated with cortactin spots ( Fig . 6 b ) . The spatial distribution of Rab4 - positive vesicles was enhanced perinuclearly as it was for DCAs . A few cortactin spots were without Rab4 - positive vesicle association in the cell periphery ( Fig . 6 b ) . Similar results were obtained with an anti - Rab4 antibody ( data not shown ) . Cortactin spots were not colocalized with CFP - Rab5 , a marker of early endosomes ( Fig . 6 c ) . In addition , GFP - CD2AP spots were not colocalized with AP - 2 , which labels clathrin - coated vesicles ( Fig . 6 d ) . CD2AP spots often were aligned and moved circumferen - tially around vesicles [ arrows in Fig . 7 ; videos 1 – 4 ( supple - mental data ) ] . Additionally , CD2AP spots accumulated as tail structures of moving vesicles [ arrowheads in Fig . 7 ; video 1 , 3 , and 4 ( supplemental data ) ] . This accumulation frequently led the way to enhanced directional movement of vesicles . The velocity of this intracellular “rocketing” motility of vesicles was calculated to 1 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 6 (cid:1) m / min ( means (cid:5) SD , n (cid:7) 4 cells ) . Similar observations were made with GFP - actin ( data not shown ) . To provide functional evidence that dynamic CD2AP spots are sites of active actin assembly , cultured podocytes were microinjected with Alexa488 - coupled G - actin and stained for CD2AP after different time periods . One minute after micro - injection , G - actin localized to the cell margin as well as to CD2AP - positve spots in podocytes ( arrows in Fig . 8 , a - c ) . Eight minutes after microinjection , the G - actin pattern grossly overlapped with all F - actin structures visualized by phalloidin ( data not shown ) . The rapid recruitment of G - actin to spots suggested that spots are sites of high actin turnover leading to the question whether actin assembly is responsible for the motility of CD2AP spots . Therefore , CD2AP spots were tracked by con - focal time - lapse imaging before and after treatment with jas - plakinolide ( 1 (cid:1) M ) . Jasplakinolide is a membrane - permeable cyclic fungal peptide that stabilizes F - actin and lowers free actin monomer concentration ( 2 ) . Dynamics of CD2AP spots were immediately abrogated after exposure to jasplakinolide [ n (cid:7) 3 experiments ; Fig . 8 , d - f ; video 5 ( supplemental data ) ] , Fig . 6 . Characterization of vesicles associ - ated with CD2AP / cortactin spots . Immuno - gold electron microscopy conﬁrmed the close association of CD2AP with vesicular membranes in podocytes ( arrow in a ) . Cor - tactin spots were colocalized with Rab4 in CFP - Rab4 - transfected podocytes ( b ) , but not with Rab5 in CFP - Rab5 - transfected podo - cytes ( c ) . AP - 2 did not colocalize with CD2AP spots ( arrows ) in GFP - CD2AP - transfected podocytes ( d ) . Image width is 1 . 4 (cid:1) m ( a ) and 20 (cid:1) m ( b - d ) .

We ﬁnally investigated whether CD2AP itself features a high turnover and whether it is a stable or a dynamic compo - nent of spots by analyzing the ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) of GFP - CD2AP ( Fig . 9 ) . Intensities were calculated for a 80 (cid:4) 80 - pixel square , averaging spots and diffuse cytoplasmic CD2AP ﬂuorescence ( method A ) , as well as for single spots ( method B ) . FRAP followed monoex - ponential functions . Curve - ﬁtting of FRAP revealed 81 (cid:5) 4 % ( A ) and 81 (cid:5) 8 % ( B ) ﬂuorescence recovery ( mobile fraction ) with a half - time of 9 (cid:5) 2 s ( n (cid:7) 6 experiments , A ) and 7 (cid:5) 3 s ( n (cid:7) 4 experiments , B ) , respectively . Thus CD2AP is rapidly turned over in spots and elsewhere . DISCUSSION In the present study , we demonstrate that CD2AP spots in podocytes are distinct structures that are composed of cortactin and F - actin . In our previous work , we showed that F - actin spots colocalized with either CD2AP , cortactin or Arp2 / 3 complex in podocytes ( 41 ) . Although it is known that cortactin colocalizes to , binds , and activates Arp2 / 3 complex with an NH 2 - terminal acidic domain ( 37 ) , according to our earlier data we could not rule out that CD2AP and cortactin localize to different F - actin spots . By double staining of cortactin and CD2AP , we now demonstrate that both proteins colocalize to identical spots . As we did not observe spots that selectively stained for either CD2AP or cortactin , both molecules appear to be essential components of spots and can be used as marker proteins . Colocalization of CD2AP and cortactin in spots may be the result of a direct interaction , as a binding site for cortactin has been recently mapped to the second proline - rich region of CD2AP ( 21 ) . Using GFP fusion proteins for actin and CD2AP , which labeled the same spots as the endogenous proteins , we ob - served that (cid:6) 50 % of spots were associated with vesicles visible as dark circular areas ( DCAs ) . Association of spots with vesicles was also conﬁrmed in nontransfected podocytes by immunoﬂuorescence and immunoelectron microscopy . Whether the other half of CD2AP spots is associated with vesicles that are too small to be visible as DCAs or whether some CD2AP spots are not linked to vesicles at all remains an open question . Using GFP - Arp3 and GFP - capping protein , Schafer and co - workers ( 28 ) observed similar spots containing F - actin and CD2AP that mainly formed ﬁnlike projections on the cell surface in the absence of membrane vesicles in the vicinity . We characterized DCAs as vesicles of a late endosomal compart - ment , because the ﬂuid phase marker dextran was trapped in less than one - third of DCAs after 30 min . Dextran - loaded vesicles that were associated with CD2AP spots frequently exhibited an inhomogeneous luminal distribution of dextran , being consistent with a membranous suborganization in the vesicle interior . Budding and internalized membrane is the hallmark of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , which are a distinct Fig . 7 . Dynamics of CD2AP spots on vesicles . CD2AP spots were highly dynamic and often linked to vesicles . GFP - CD2AP spots moved circumferentially around vesicles ( arrows in b and c ) or developed a propulsive force leading to vesicle movement ( arrowheads and * in a and b ) . Podocytes in panel b and c were incubated for 30 min with ﬂuorescent dextran . Image width is 10 (cid:1) m . See also videos 1 – 4 ( supplemental data ) .

The fact that CD2AP / cor - tactin spots did not colocalize with AP - 2 and Rab5 in podo - cytes provides further evidence that CD2AP spots do not associate with early endosomes . Moreover , colocalization of cortactin spots in podocytes with Rab4 - positive vesicles places these vesicles at a later stage in the endosomal pathway . Colocalization of spots with Rab4 is consistent with the work of Cormont et al . ( 4 ) , who discovered CD2AP to be a binding partner of the GTP - bound form of Rab4 . Rab4 has been implicated in endosomal membrane sorting into the recycling and degradative pathway ( 23 , 32 ) . Based on several ﬁndings , Cormont et al . ( 4 ) speculated that Rab4 , besides other func - tions , controls sorting from early to late endosomes . First , morphologically changed endosomes after Rab4 and CD2AP coexpression included the late endosome marker Rab7 . Sec - ond , horseradish peroxidase uptake was altered by CD2AP overexpression only beyond 15 min , and , third , CD2AP was not involved in transferrin receptor recycling which is an early recycling pathway . It is noteworthy that a large fraction of CD2AP spots is associated with vesicles in podocytes . In contrast , spots were rarely associated with vesicles in PtK1 ﬁbroblasts ( 28 ) . Fur - thermore , overexpression of a constitutive active form of the small GTPase ARF6 in PtK1 ﬁbroblasts and CHO cells was needed to induce vesicle - associated actin spots and comet tails , the head of which stained for CD2AP ( 27 ) . In addition , association of CD2AP with vesicular structures was only detectable in COS - 7 cells after transfection with CD2AP ( 17 ) and in CHO cells after cotransfection with CD2AP and Cbl or Rab4 ( 4 ) . In contrast , we detected association of CD2AP with vesicles in nontransfected podocytes . These ﬁndings may in - dicate that podocytes possess speciﬁcally enlarged endosomal compartment ( s ) . Our ﬁndings are consistent with the concept that CD2AP in spots around vesicles could be required for formation of MVBs and for protein sorting into the degradative pathway . Accord - ing to this concept , Kim et al . ( 16 ) observed a twofold increase in MVBs in podocytes of wild - type mice after intravenous injection of ferritin , which failed to stimulate MVB formation in CD2AP (cid:8) / (cid:9) mice . Simultaneous overexpression of CD2AP with Cbl or Rab4 induced enlargement of EEA1 - positive early endosomes in CHO cells ( 4 ) , suggesting that CD2AP is in - volved in a sorting or transport step distal to early endosomes . MVB formation is required for downregulation of activated signaling receptors ( 15 ) . Accordingly , CD2AP has been shown to be involved in EGF receptor trafﬁcking ( 21 ) , in PDGF receptor ( 4 ) , and in VEGF receptor ( Flt - 1 ) degradation ( 19 ) . Our confocal time - lapse microscopy of GFP - actin and GFP - CD2AP in podocytes revealed the dynamic nature of spots in podocytes and a rather short but variable lifetime . Spot motility is nondirectional and does not seem to be linked to intracellular ﬁlaments . Spots are characterized by rapid accumulation of Fig . 8 . Motility of CD2AP spots depends on actin polymerization . Fluorescent G - actin was microinjected into podocytes . Cells were ﬁxed 1 min after microinjection and stained for CD2AP ( a ) . Microinjected G - actin immediately was recruited to spots and to the cell margin ( b ) , colocalizing with CD2AP in spots ( arrows in a - c ) . GFP - CD2AP - expressing podocytes were tracked by confocal microscopy . Images were taken every 10 s . After 10 images had been obtained , jasplakinolide ( JAS ) was injected into the cell chamber ( ﬁnal concentration 1 (cid:1) M ) and image collection ( every 10 s ) was continued after 120 s . Panel d shows GFP - CD2AP spots at the cell periphery before application of jasplakinolide . Tracking lines illustrate the dynamic movement of CD2AP spots ( e ) . After injection of jasplakinolide , CD2AP dynamics are immediately abrogated ( f ) . Image width is 17 (cid:1) m ( a - c ) , 15 (cid:1) m ( d ) , and 5 (cid:1) m ( e , f ) . See also video 5 .

Actin polymerization drives spot motility , as demonstrated by inhibition of motility with jas - plakinolide . The high turnover rate of CD2AP in spots would be consistent with an involvement of CD2AP in regulating actin polymerization . In fact , it has been shown that CD2AP interacts with F - actin ( 20 ) and with several proteins known to regulate actin ﬁlament assembly : cortactin ( 21 ) , capping pro - tein ( 13 ) , and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 - kinase ( 11 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is importantly involved in various pathways of vesicular trafﬁcking ( 34 ) . Recently , it has become evident that actin polymerization participates in internalizing clathrin - coated pits ( 24 ) . However , CD2AP spots were not colocalized with AP - 2 , an adaptor protein in clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis , in our experiments . On the other hand , the role of the actin cytoskeleton in later endosomal compartments , to which we localized CD2AP spots in podocytes , is not well deﬁned . GFP - CD2AP as well as GFP - actin spots on vesicles exhibited either a circumferential movement of one or multiple spots around the vesicle or were concentrated at one point on the circumference generating a propulsive force for vesicular movement . The latter kind of movement has been reconstituted with vesicles of HeLa cells in Xenopus laevis egg extract ( 36 ) . Interestingly , (cid:6) 80 % of vesicles with actin tails were MVBs . Propulsive movement of vesicles has also been demonstrated for cortactin spots by Kaksonen et al . ( 14 ) . Propulsive move - ments may enhance the chance of endosomes to reach targets within shorter times . On the other hand , we can only speculate about the function of the circumferential movement of vesicle - associated spots . By targeting coﬁlin to late endosomes in Dictyostelium , Drengk et al . ( 6 ) showed that loss of the late endosomal actin coat leads to aggregation of late endosomal vacuoles . Thus F - actin could function as a docking barrier . For docked vesicles , in contrast , actin polymerization has been suggested to forcibly promote fusion ( 8 ) . Finally , actin could be involved in the inward budding of endosomal membranes and in pinching off , processes that are poorly understood ( 26 ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank C .
