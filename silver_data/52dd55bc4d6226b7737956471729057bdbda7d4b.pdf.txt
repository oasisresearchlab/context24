While the processes of phase separation rely on different elementary steps and ionic strength compared with aggregation , which could form condensates even without phase separation , these two processes are apparently mechanistically connected . 4 There is a direct link between them in many disease - associated proteins , that the formation of condensates by phase separation often followed by aggregation to a less dynamic state . 5 Recent research of condensates has focused on their biological functions with the discovery of properties and molecular mechanisms of their formation and function . 6 Numerous pathological and physiological processes are associated with dysfunction of the condensates at differ - ent scales , which provide promising targets for clinical research on related diseases . 7 These works provided excit - ing discoveries and as of late has added to our under - standing of the condensates . Therefore , a more extensive description of these condensates is urgently needed for the development of novel therapies . Here , we have reviewed the current understanding of biomolecular condensates and the molecular mechanisms of their formation and function . Moreover , we summa - rized the functions of condensates and therapeutic targets for diseases . We further highlight the available regulatory targets and methods , and discussed the significance and challenges of targeting these condensates . 2 PROPERTIES OF BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATES We propose that there are three properties of biomolecu - lar condensates that determine whether the condensates are formed . Also , the properties obtained by condensates provide new features for cellular components and alter pathological or physiological processes . These properties include : condensates are in liquid - or solid - like state , con - sist of dynamic components , and present a multiphase immiscible state . 2 . 1 Biomolecular condensates in liquid - or solid - like state The interaction between proteins or RNAs promotes phase separation and produces micron - sized droplets ( Figure 1 ) . 8 There are many liquid - like state and long - established condensates in cells , such as ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) par - ticles , stress granules ( SGs ) , and P granules . RNP particles play a unique role in epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation . 2 SGs are formed when cells are stimulated by external pressure to suspend the translation process of mRNA , and they quickly depolymerize to restore nor - mal cell physiological functions when external pressure is relieved . P granules are composed of protein and RNA in the germ cells of Caenorhabditis elegans . They flow out of the nucleus under shear force and then drip and fuse into larger droplets . 9 LAF - 1 , the DDX3 RNA helicase in P granules , can also be separated into droplets in vitro . 10 Moreover , a member of the ADP - ribosyl transferase fam - ily , poly ADP - ribose ( PAR ) polymerase 1 , recognizes DNA damage sites and synthesizes PAR chains . 11 PAR attracts fused in sarcoma ( FUS ) to the DNA damage site and further form droplets rich in damaged DNA . 12 These condensates are normally in liquid state with high fluidity but can sometimes be more viscous and viscoelastic - like solids . In RNP particles , inactivation of the RNA helicase results in a transition from liquid to solid state . 13 The spindle - defective protein 5 ( SPD - 5 ) is required for centrosome assembly . Recombinant SPD - 5 can form dense droplets in vitro , which are dynamic and liquid at first but then harden . 14 The Balbiani body in Xeno - pus oocytes is another condensate in solid - like state . The rigid Balbiani body protects its isolated components from damage and stores macromolecules and organelles for the next generation . 15 The influx of protons and a pronounced acidification of the cytoplasm also lead to extensive macro - molecular assembly of proteins and reduced the fluidity of the cytoplasm , ultimately transforming the cytoplasm into a solid - like state with stronger mechanical stability . 16 Moreover , the liquid – solid phase transition is necessary for NIU et al . 3 of 32 FIGURE 1 Properties of biomolecular condensates . The three properties of biomolecular condensates . There were a large number of condensates in liquid - like state at different locations in cells such as SGs , P granules , RNP , and PARP1 . The high fluidity of these condensates contributes to their ability to regulate the rate of chemical reactions . There are also a large number of solid - like condensates present in cells such as Balbiani body , SPD - 5 , and Oskar ribonucleoprotein granule . These condensates have less fluidity , but function to protect their contents . The components in the condensates such as Disheveled , Dyn2 γ , and γ - tubulin are able to move freely and dynamically exchange with the surrounding molecules , which support its ability to regulate biochemical processes in cells . The components of the condensates such as P granules , SGs , and paraspeckles are usually not uniformly distributed but in a multiphase immiscible state . RNP , ribonucleoprotein ; SPD - 5 , spindle - defective protein 5 ; PARP1 , poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase 1 ; SGs , stress granules . the formation of the Oskar RNP granule and participate in Drosophila embryonic development . 17 Prion protein ( PrP ) spontaneously phase - separates into droplets under physi - ological conditions and gradually matures into solid - like β - rich amyloid with self - replicating function . 18 Collectively , biomolecular condensates are either liquid or solid . 2 . 2 Dynamic components in biomolecular condensates The components in biomolecular condensates maintain a state of free movement and can be dynamically exchanged with surrounding molecules ( Figure 1 ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technology enables the quantitative study of component mobility in these conden - sates . In P granules , components quickly exchanged with the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleus . 9 Disheveled is a cytoplasmic protein that acts as a key effector upstream of Wnt signaling pathway , which has a strong propen - sity to form punctate . It has been reported that there is a continuous material exchange between Disheveled and cytoplasmic components . 19 Moreover , Dyn2 γ or γ - tubulin complex can be exchanged with cytoplasmic components within a few minutes after photobleaching . 20 2 . 3 Multiphase immiscible state in biomolecular condensates Several proteins are contained in biomolecular conden - sates , while a small number of these proteins is required 4 of 32 NIU et al . to promote the formation of droplets in vitro , and most of them likely have a synergistic effect to promote phase sepa - ration ( Figure 1 ) . 21 , 22 The P granules have a heterostructure with a specific composition of RNP particles sequestered in the different region . The assembly of P granules in embryos can be regulated by phosphorylation , suggesting that their substructures have clear molecular specificity . 23 Jain et al . 24 reported SGs contain a stable core struc - ture and a dynamic shell . In paraspeckles , AG - rich RNA and long noncoding RNA Neat1 are distributed along the boundaries . 25 Collectively , to understand biomolecular condensates , we must describe as closely as possible the communities of biomolecular which comprise them . Biomolecular condensates contain a variety of substances and present a heterogeneous immiscible state of dense and dilute phases . The accepted criteria for defining a condensate are that it is spherical , fused , and recovered from photobleaching . 26 Live - cell fluorescence confocal microscopy and 1 , 6 - hexanediol are commonly used to characterize the localization or properties of condensates . 27 However , it should be noted that less evidence is not enough to definitively prove that the structure is a condensate . The fast recovery of photobleaching may be due to the reversible binding of proteins to porous solid structure . 26 1 , 6 - Hexanediol is able to alter the membrane permeability of living cells , which can lead to additional artifacts . 28 3 FORMATION MECHANISMS OF BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATES Recent studies have revealed the formation and function mechanisms of biomolecular condensates . These mecha - nisms empower the components assemble into conden - sates and further perform various duties . Understanding these mechanisms not only advances our knowledge of biomolecular condensates , but also provides the basis for the research of transformation by using condensates . In this section , we reviewed formation mechanisms of condensates . 3 . 1 The formation of condensates depends on multivalent interactions Recent studies have focused on their biological func - tion with the discovery of their physical properties and production mechanisms . An increasing amount of experi - mental evidence suggests that multivalent interactions reg - ulates the formation of biomolecular condensates . 3 There are five main types of multivalent interactions : cation – anion , dipole – dipole , cation – π , π – π , and hydrophobic interactions . 29 Cation – anion interactions refer to the attractive or repulsive interaction between molecules with cation and anion , and dipole – dipole interactions refer to the attraction between positively charged part and nega - tively charged part ( Figure 2A ) . The Nephrin intracellular domain is able to assemble with anionic partners to form condensates . 30 The main component of the nuage or germ granule , Ddx4 , needs extremely strong cation – anion and dipole – dipole interaction to facilitate phase separation . 31 In addition , there is a special type of dipole – dipole inter - action known as hydrogen bonding . 32 Hydrogen bonds allowing polypeptide chain to form secondary protein , which further form tertiary protein through multivalent interactions . It has been reported that a peptide from the primary adhesive protein Mfp - 5 , GK - 16 * , requires dihy - droxyphenylalanine and glycine mediated hydrogen bonds for phase separation . 33 Histidine residues in histidine - rich squid beak proteins generate condensates by forming hydrogen bonds with tyrosine . 34 Cation – π interactions are commonly found between amino acid with cation and aro - matic amino acid ( Figure 2B ) . In mussel foot protein - 1 residues , cation – π interactions can overcome the repulsion of cation – anion interactions and promoting phase sepa - ration of molecules with same charge . 35 π – π interactions are usually found in aromatic amino acid ( Figure 2C ) . Intriguingly , π – π interactions have also been reported to be present in nonaromatic amino acid such as fragile X men - tal retardation protein . 36 Hydrophobic interactions refer to hydrophobic groups that avoid water in close proximity to each other ( Figure 2D ) . Tropoelastin relies on hydrophobic interactions to facilitate phase separation . 37 3 . 2 Thermodynamic aspects of condensate formation In the classic thermodynamic context , the formation of condensates is a transient and nonequilibrium process , that is , the initial equilibrium state of the system is changed through appropriate changes in thermodynamic condi - tions , and the condensates are formed by nucleation , growth , and coarsening . 38 This is a density transition event that occurs when the concentration of biomoleculars exceeds the saturation concentration , resulting in the for - mation of a dense phase enriched in biomoleculars , which is relatively depleted by a dilute phase . 39 , 40 This concentra - tion threshold also known as the percolation threshold that defines the gel point . 41 Due to differences in surface curva - ture , the interaction between biomoleculars on the surface of small condensates less than big condensates further leads to small condensates to lose more easily ( Figure 2E ) . Larger condensates will grow at the expense of smaller condensates . NIU et al . 5 of 32 FIGURE 2 Formation mechanism of biomolecular condensates . ( A ) Nephrin forms condensates through cation – anion and dipole – dipole interactions . In these interactions , oppositely charged ion and biomoleculars attract each other to promote phase separation . GK - 16 * and HBPs form condensates through hydrogen bonds . In these interactions , hydrogen ion donor and acceptor attract each other to promote phase separation . ( B ) Mfp - 1 forms condensates through cation – π interactions . In these interactions , cations and aromatic amino acid attract each other to promote phase separation . Mfp - 1 , mussel foot protein - 1 . ( C ) FMRP forms condensates through π – π interactions . In these interactions , mainly aromatic amino acids such as arginine attract each other to promote phase separation . FMRP , fragile X mental retardation protein . ( D ) Tropoelastin forms condensates through hydrophobic interactions . In these interactions , biomoleculars with hydrophobic regions attract each other and repel water to further promote phase separation . ( E ) In the thermodynamic process , condensates are stable when the biomolecular concentration exceeds the saturation concentration . With the increase of biomolecular concentration , the condensates change from dilute phase to dense phase . Small condensates cannot hold onto their proteins as well as larger condensates , which promotes diffusion flux from small to large condensates . E , binding energy ; T , temperature ; S , entropy . In addition to the formation of condensates , changes in thermodynamic conditions such as concentration or temperature are also associated with altered size and num - ber of condensates . 29 , 38 For example , the size of enhancer condensates depends critically on the concentration of transcription factors ( TFs ) that bind enhancers . 42 , 43 Due to different surface curvature , the number of small to large condensates tends to decrease gradually , and small condensates can grow or shrink rapidly , whereas large condensates takes several days . 40 The residence time of component reactants is strongly influenced by the size of condensates . Molecular diffusion also depends on the size . It has been reported that the effective mesh size of LAF - 1 condensates is 3 – 8 nm , which determines the size scale of molecular diffusion and permeability . 44 Moreover , the ini - tiation of the antiviral immune response may be related to the size of the condensates formed around dsDNA in the cytoplasm . 45 Together , in the process of condensate formation , peptide with different chemical properties and RNAs with anion could establish various affinity interac - tions , which enable these component to assemble . Due to entropy - driven effects , such assembly would inherently reduce the solubility of the molecules , thus promote the formation of condensates . Regulating the formation of biomolecular condensates needs to focus 6 of 32 NIU et al . FIGURE 3 The mechanism of biomolecular condensates function . ( A ) In the condensates formed by Dextran , Polyethylene glycol and mRNA , the enrichment effect collects most of specific molecules into condensates interior to provide enough reactants for the chemical reaction . ( B ) In the condensates formed by Ape1 and nucleic acid , isolation effect completely block Atg19 on the outside of the condensates to maintain a stable internal composition . Ape1 , aminopeptidase I ; Atg19 , autophagy - related protein 19 . ( C ) In localization effect , condensates localize their internal components to specific regions in the cell . Nephrin , Nck and N - WASP are located in the cell membrane ; ANXA11 and PBs are localized in the cytoplasm ; NPM1 and SPOP are existed in the nucleus . N - WASP , neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ; NPM1 , nucleophosmin 1 ; SPOP , spotted POZ protein ; ANXA11 , annexin A11 ; PBs , P - bodies . on these multivalent interactions or thermodynamic conditions . 4 BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATES 4 . 1 The mechanism of biomolecular condensates function Biomolecular condensates are able to increase the con - centration of their internal components and lead to changes in the chemical reaction rate ( Figure 3A ) . Con - densates formed by the polyethylene glycol / dextran aque - ous two - phase system can increase RNA concentration and ribozyme cleavage rates . 46 Low - molecular - weight mononucleotides and cationic peptides facilitate phase separation that further selectively chelate porphyrins , inor - ganic nanoparticles , and enzymes . This enrichment effect ultimately increases the phosphorylation rate of glucose . 47 Moreover , biomolecular condensates can also form lateral compartments enriched for particular lipids and proteins on cell membranes . 48 Biomolecular condensates have isolation effect that enables them to maintain a homeostatic environment ( Figure 3B ) . Heterochromatin components such as nucle - osomes and DNA are preferentially distributed in droplets formed by heterochromatin protein 1 α . 49 TIS granules , formed by RNA - binding protein ( RBP ) TIS11B , are able to further interweave with the endoplasmic reticulum to form a reticular network and maintain a different physic - ochemical environment from the cytoplasm . 50 P granules act as protein size filters in the transport of molecules to the nucleus by excluding proteins larger than 45 kDa . 51 Moreover , the specific receptor protein for the selective autophagy cargo aminopeptidase I , autophagy - related NIU et al . 7 of 32 protein 19 , is localized only on the surface of aminopepti - dase I droplets in vitro and in vivo but does not penetrate into the droplets . 52 Biomolecular condensates also have position effect that allowing them to localize to specific regions of cell ( Figure 3C ) . Nucleophosmin 1 ( NPM1 ) forms condensates in the nucleolus with proteins containing arginine - rich linear motif and ribosomal RNA . 53 Spotted POZ pro - tein , a substrate linker for cullin3 - RING ubiquitin ligase , forms condensates at the nuclear speckles . 54 Besides , P - bodies ( PBs ) , the condensates formed by mRNA decap - ping and 5′ → 3′ degradation reactions occur abnormally , anchored on microtubules and exhibit spatially restricted motion that depends on microtubules . 55 The N - terminus of Annexin A11 promotes the formation of membrane - less RNA granules , and the C - terminus interacts with and localizes to lysosomes . 56 Moreover , Nephrin , Nck , and N - WASP are able to promote phase separation on lipid bilayer membranes and increase the residence time of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complexes on the membranes . 57 4 . 2 Functions of biomolecular condensates In recent years , a series of evidences have shown that multifunctional condensates are not only related to phys - iological processes , but also to pathological processes ( Table 1 ) . Given the pivotal role of biomolecular conden - sates in biological processes , its targeting is promising for clinical research . 7 In the following section , we summa - rized the functions of these condensates at three different biological scales including molecular scale , cellular scale , and tissue scale ( Figure 4 ) . 4 . 2 . 1 Molecular functions regulated by biomolecular condensates At the molecular scale , biomolecular condensates are crit - ical for amplification , transcription , translation , and post - translational modification process . For example , nuclear condensates are critical for the establishment and stabi - lization of BuGZ functions in the assembly of spindle , 130 allowing the enrichment of tubulin along microtubules . 105 Phase transition of chromatin that is induced by global histone deacetylation confers precise movement of chro - mosomes during cell division . 131 RNP particles are involved in synthesis of ribosomal RNA , maturation of small nuclear RNA and mRNA . 132 Mediator promotes phase separation with activation domain of TFs such as Oct4 , Sox2 , and Nanog , further regulating the transcription process . 94 Arabidopsis FLL2 promotes the liquid – liquid separation of poly ( A ) com - plexes and regulates transcriptional process . 86 Moreover , condensates formed by RBP FXR1 activate translation of RNA and drive spermiogenesis . 88 Intriguingly , it has been recently reported that TFs are able to directly acti - vate transcription before phase separation occurs , but the formation of condensates has transcriptional repressive function . 133 , 134 Cytoplasmic protein YTHDF induced by heat shock binds to m6A - modified mRNAs , significantly enhances phase separation , and alerts stability and translation process . 128 Furthermore , condensates are also involved in UPS and autophagosome process , which provide quality control of protein synthesis . 62 4 . 2 . 2 Cellular processes involved in biomolecular condensates At the cellular scale , condensates have been found to be closely related to transport and signal transduction . Sphingolipids are commonly found in eukaryotic cells participate in intracellular material transport process and as structural molecules of cell membranes . During the maturation of the Golgi cistern , sphingolipids attract and facilitate phase separation of cholesterol in the bilayer of gall vesicles , further regulating the fusion process of the vesicles . 108 It was reported that cell surface transmembrane recep - tors require condensates for signal transduction . In Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway , the destruction complex func - tions by forming condensates . 112 However , transforming growth factor - beta induces the expression of DACT1 and forms condensates in the cytoplasm which further inhibits Wnt signaling . 111 Xue et al . 135 recently reported basic fibroblast growth factors form condensates with hep - aran sulphate proteoglycans and activate FGFR signaling pathway . Besides , cytoplasmic scaffolds zonula occludens - 1 , zonula occludens - 2 , and claudins phase separate to regulate the assembly of tight junctions . 117 4 . 2 . 3 The role of biomolecular condensates in tissue Immunological processes regulated by condensates Mounting evidence has highlighted that biomolecular con - densates are directly relevant to immune signaling and immune modulation . 116 , 136 , 137 On the plasma membrane , immune signaling including T cell receptor ( TCR ) and B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling pathway is regulated by condensates . The main component of the TCR signal - ing pathway is the discrete TCR microclusters on the 8 of 32 NIU et al . TABLE 1 Physiological / pathological processes regulated by biomolecular condensates .

These microclusters consist of a series of pro - teins including TCR , CD28 , PD1 , ZAP70 , LCK , LAT , PLC γ 1 , GRB2 , and SOS1 . 138 – 140 It has been reported that four proteins in TCR microclusters , LAT , PLC γ 1 , GRB2 , and SOS1 , are able to form condensates . 141 , 142 These conden - sates participate in the activation , the baseline level reset after activation of TCR signaling , and the spatial organi - zation of signaling receptors to further influence ligand binding . 140 , 143 , 144 In the BCR signaling pathway , scaffold protein SLP65 and its binding partner CIN85 form con - densates in the cytoplasm of resting B cells , and bind to the plasma membrane after BCR activation . 145 These condensates function to facilitate calcium signaling and downstream signaling pathways . 146 In the cell , stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) path - way , SG pathway , inflammasome pathway , and nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - κ B ) signaling pathway are regulated by con - densates . Cyclic GMP – AMP synthase ( cGAS ) combines double - stranded DNA from pathogens or DNA damage , and activate the STING signaling pathway to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines . 45 , 147 Recent reports have shown that cGAS not only binds to DNA and protects 10 of 32 NIU et al . FIGURE 4 Functions of biomolecular condensates . The functions of biomolecular condensates . At molecular scale , biomolecular condensates are critical for amplification , transcription , translation , and posttranslational modification process such as phosphorylation , acetylation , ubiquitination , SUMOylation , and methylation . At cellular scale , condensates participate in signal transduction , stress sensing , and transportation processes . At tissue scale , condensates involved in DNA damage , oncogenes express , antibody resistance , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , frontotemporal dementia , ischemia – reperfusion , calcium parado , innate immunity , and adaptive immunity processes . Pol , polymerase ; SGs , stress granules ; PBs , P - bodies ; FUS , fused in sarcoma . it from interpretation , but also forms condensates with RNA and enhance STING signaling pathway when DNA concentration is low . 148 – 150 STING and its downstream components TBK1 and IRF3 also undergo phase separation process , but they suppress innate immune signaling . 137 , 151 Droplets composed of DNA repair proteins such as Rad52 interact with different types of DNA damage - inducible microtubule filaments , promote the localization of DNA repair proteins to damage sites , and maintain genome stability . 66 FUS is capable of phase separation at sites of DNA damage . 12 Moreover , the virus uses condensates to evade immune surveillance . ORF9 , ORF52 , and VP22 NIU et al . 11 of 32 from viruses combined with DNA to form droplets and prevents cGAS activation . 152 – 154 Nuclear domain 10 forms condensates and restricts the expression of viral genes after viral DNA invades nucleus . 155 In recent years , SARS - CoV - 2 has emerged as an urgent threat to global public health , which virus is assembled by the interaction of SARS - CoV - 2 nucleocapsid protein ( SARS2 - NP ) , viral RNA genome , and M protein . 156 , 157 SARS2 - NPs can form con - densates that impair the binding of mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins and IFN response for immune evasion and attract RNA - dependent RNA polymerase complex to promote virus replication . 121 , 158 Under external stress conditions , eukaryotic cells form SGs and PBs , which store large amounts of mRNA and inhibit the translation process of cells . 159 Recent studies have shown that G3BP1 bind to RNF125 in virus - induced SGs to promote its degradation . 160 G3BP1 is also able to directly interact with proteins such as retinoic acid - inducible gene I and protein kinase R to act as a positive regulator of the innate immune pathway and block protein translation and viral replication . 161 PrP Sup35 forms con - densates under external pressure and specific pH condi - tions in yeast . 126 Thermoregulatory protein heat - shock TF 1 generates condensates and efficiently drives gene tran - scription of heat - shock - proteins to maintain intracellular protein homeostasis . 162 Inflammasome is composed of sensor proteins , apoptosis - associated speck - like protein containing a CARD , and Caspase 1 , which regulates the response to viral invasion through cytokine secretion and gasder - min D mediated pyroptosis . 163 Shen et al . 164 found that NLRP6 inflammasome can form condensates with double - stranded RNA and is efficiently triggered by lipoteichoic acid .

Related research will open up more possibilities for future drug discovery . 6 REGULATORY TARGETS AND METHODS OF BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATES 6 . 1 Regulatory targets of biomolecular condensates Emerging understanding of the mechanisms of conden - sate formation and function provides novel therapeutic opportunities . Among the components involved in the condensates , many of them were found to be able to serve as regulatory targets . In this section , we comprehen - sively discussed the latest findings of regulatory targets of biomolecular condensates . These targets include nucleic acid , amino acid , protein repeat domain , intrinsically disordered region ( IDR ) , macromolecule , ATP , and pH . 6 . 1 . 1 Nucleic acid serves as a key component of condensates In many cases , nucleic acid functions to facilitate phase separation ( Figure 6A ) . DNA binds to heterochromatin protein 1 α and promotes phase separation . 49 RNA binds to G3BP1 to promote the formation of condensates then regulate the translation process . 225 There are two highly conserved polybasic regions in the N - terminal of PrP frag - ment , which have charge complementarity with nucleic acid . 18 In the presence of 150 mM NaCl , the addition of crude tRNA promotes PrP phase separation , which further turn into solid - like condensates . 18 However , during phase separation of prion - like RBPs , a high RNA : protein ratio inhibits formation of condensates . 226 Intriguingly , RNA not only contributes to the formation of condensates but also is able to regulate itself by binding to condensates . The polyglutamine ( polyQ ) protein Whi3 generates differ - ent condensates depending on the RNA sequence further induce RNA conformational changes . 227 6 . 1 . 2 Amino acid affects the formation of condensates Amino acid mutations or modifications can modulate phase separation ( Figure 6B ) . Phosphorylation of serine 149 of G3BP inhibits the formation of SGs . 228 The adaptor protein Nck promotes condensate formation through three SRC homology 3 domains that bind to multiple proline - rich fragments in N - WASP , and an SH2 domain binds to multiple phosphotyrosine sites in Nephrin . 229 Three evenly distributed tryptophan - binding pockets in Arg - onaute2 and glycine / tryptophan - rich domain in TNRC6B produce condensates . 230 Moreover , different phosphoryla - tion patterns in serine / threonine of fragile X mental retar - dation protein and tyrosine of CAPRIN1 are associated with phase separation . 231 6 . 1 . 3 Protein repeat domain contribute to condensate formation Protein repeat domain is critical for the formation of biomolecular condensates ( Figure 6C ) . A lot of evidence showed that mutated protein repeats change the solubil - ity of proteins and contribute to a variety of developmental and neurodegenerative diseases . 232 It has been reported that the VASA - related P granule proteins GLH - 1 , GLH - 2 , and GLH - 4 contain nuclear pore complex - like FG repeat domains in C . elegans . 51 6 . 1 . 4 IDR is required for proteins to form condensates Intrinsically disordered proteins refer to functional pro - teins that cannot fold into a clear spatial structure ( Figure 6D ) , which typically have the IDR . 233 Proteins with IDRs are also involved in multivalence protein interac - tions and tend to form condensates . 5 The N - terminus of dual - specificity kinase DYRK3 form SGs through its IDR and kinase activity . 234 IDR of FUS promote condensate formation when DNA damage or cytoplasmic stress . 124 Moreover , CsoS2 , Ddx4 , NPM1 , and Xvelo also promote phase separation through homotypic interactions of its IDR . 15 , 31 , 106 , 235 6 . 1 . 5 Macromolecule crowding and confinement promote the assembly of condensates It has been reported that the addition of organic additives and salts increases crowding and confinement effects in solution and further influence the formation of conden - sates ( Figure 6E ) . 236 Crowding effect refers to the volume repulsion effect of one soluble macromolecule on another soluble macromolecule , and confinement effect refers to effect of the fixed boundary on solubility of the macro - molecule . These effects promote the assembly of SPD - 5 , cGAS , microtubule polymerase ZYG - 9 , and microtubule stabilizing protein TPXL - 1 into condensates . 14 , 45 Moreover , although the Golgi protein GM130 is not an inherently disordered protein , its overexpression still enables the NIU et al . 19 of 32 20 of 32 NIU et al . formation of droplets . 237 Notably , molecular chaperones can partially counteract these effects by allowing the pro - tein to fold within the chaperone cavity and releasing the native - like protein . 238 Protein disulfide isomerase , a pro - tein folding catalyst acts as a molecular chaperone , prevent the accumulation of lysozyme in the crowded state . 239 6 . 1 . 6 ATP and pH regulate the formation of condensates Recently , the dynamic changes of ATP and pH related to cellular respiration have been discovered in process of phase separation ( Figure 6F ) . ATP participated in the assembly of SGs and viscosity of the nucleolus . 24 Shi et al . 240 revealed that ATP promote Ddx3xb undergo liquid – liquid phase separation through its N - terminal IDR . Besides , either ATP or the DEAD - box ATPase Dhh1 mod - ulate the formation of PBs . 241 Changes in pH also affect the size and solubility of condensates . 242 A lower pH lead to a decrease in cytoplasmic fluidity and inhibits phase separation of ovalbumin . 243 Collectively , we summarize the current regulatory tar - gets of biomolecular condensates , which are capable of acting as drivers and disruptors of condensate formation and function . More importantly , condensates are consid - ered to be an emerging explanation for a large number of previously unknown phenomena , and further explo - ration is needed to explore more available regulatory targets for regulating condensates to interfere with various physiological and pathological functions . 6 . 2 Regulatory methods of biomolecular condensates In order to regulate the formation of biomolecular con - densates , here are some methods that can be used against the above six targets . Modulating the formation of these condensates provides potential strategy for treatment of diseases . In this section , we comprehensively discussed the latest findings of available regulatory methods of biomolec - ular condensates ( Figure 7 ) . These methods include DNA editing , RNA interference , protein degradation , and molecule drugs treatment . 6 . 2 . 1 Editing DNA involved in condensate formation DNA editing relies on DNA recognition elements and a variety of endonucleases to introduce mutations into genes , which interfere the formation of condensates at the DNA stage . 244 There are four types of DNA editing systems commonly used : meganuclease , zinc - finger nuclease , tran - scription activator - like effector nuclease , and CRISPR - Cas system . Meganucleases are also known as homing endonu - cleases , which are a class of highly sequence - specific and efficient enzymes found in yeast . 245 Meganucleases sys - tem can specifically recognize DNA sequences ranging in length from 14 to 40 base pairs , then cleave homologous alleles without introns to generate double - strand breaks and stimulate gene repair processes for homing . 246 The zinc - finger nuclease system relies on zinc finger proteins and endonucleases . Zinc finger proteins can bind DNA and recognize 9 bp DNA through their Cys2 - His2 fingers , and endonucleases can induce double - strand breaks at spe - cific positions in DNA , further achieving the purpose of gene deletion or addition through nonhomologous end joining or homology - directed repair pathways . 247 The tran - scription activator - like effector nuclease system is similar as the zinc - finger nuclease system , which also requires the fusion of DNA - binding elements to the nonspe - cific FokI nuclease . The difference between two systems is that the DNA - binding elements in the transcription activator - like effector nuclease system are derived from Xanthomonas transcription activator - like effectors , which contain a highly conserved repeat sequence that recog - nizes specific DNA sequence . 248 The CRISPR / Cas system was originally discovered in bacteria and shows an antivi - ral function by cleaving nucleic acids that invade cells , which is currently the most used gene editing system . 249 This system can cut DNA sequences via two pathways : one relies on multiprotein complexes , and the other relies on a single Cas protein . Notably , these systems have the disadvantage of off - target editing . 250 – 252 Recently , Shin et al . recently reported CasDrop , a novel optogenetic technology developed based on DNA edit - ing , regulate phase separation of inherently disordered proteins . 98 Intriguingly , the presence or absence of the specific nucleic acid can be further determined by DNA FIGURE 6 Regulatory targets of biomolecular condensates . The six regulatory targets of biomolecular condensates : ( A ) nucleic acids are essential for the formation of condensates such as G3BP1 , Whi3 , and prion protein ; ( B ) amino acids such as positively charged amino acids , negatively charged amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids are involved in the formation of condensates ; ( C ) protein repeat domain such as the FG motif of GLH - 1 , GLH - 2 , and GLH - 4 is critical for condensates stability ; ( D ) intrinsically disordered region is able to regulate the formation of condensates such as DYRK3 ; ( E ) concentration , crowding effect and edge effect can regulate the formation of condensates ; ( F ) ATP is involved in the formation of condensates such as Ddx3xb , SGs , and PBs ; pH is related to condensate formation such as Ovalbumin .

The 60 bp poly - T DNA and poly - l - lysine promote phase separation and result in a turbid solution , whereas the addition of CRISPR / Cas12a or Cas13a cleaves specific DNA or RNA sequences and inhibits the formation of condensates . 253 6 . 2 . 2 Interfering RNA disrupts biomoleculars to form condensates RNA interference ( RNAi ) modulate phase separation at the RNA stage . There are two types of RNAi used : small RNA and antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) . 254 The small RNA can be divided into three categories : short inter - fering RNAs , repeat - associated short interfering RNAs , and microRNAs . In the process of gene silencing , these RNAs rearrange in the RNP to form RNA - induced silenc - ing complexes , which further recognize complementary mRNA through its single - stranded siRNA and induce mRNA degradation . 255 ASOs are single strands of deoxynu - cleotides that usually 8 – 50 bp in length , which were found to have the ability to inhibit the translation of Rous sar - coma viral RNA in 1978 . 256 ASOs can bind to RNA to form a DNA – RNA complex , which enables RNA to be degraded by RNase H and ultimately inhibit protein expression . 257 Recent studies have shown that the fluidity of PAR and their response to extracellular osmotic pressure can be reduced by small RNA . 258 NONO - TF E3 translo - cation renal cell carcinoma is a subtype of renal cell carcinoma . 259 Small RNA blocks their phase separation 22 of 32 NIU et al .

The lysosomal degradation sys - tem needs lysosomes to degrade extracellular substances , plasma membrane proteins , cytosolic components , or organelles . There are two lysosomal degradation pathways in eukaryotic cells : the endosome – lysosomal pathway and the autophagy pathway . Specifically , the endosome – lysosomal pathway degrades endocytic substances and excess cellular components through a membrane binding process . 268 In autophagy pathway , a part of the cytoplasm is engulfed by phagocytes to form autophagosomes , which are further fused with and degraded by lysosomes . 269 These protein degradation methods can degrade polyQ proteins , such as mutant ATXN3 , which can result in type III spinocerebellar ataxia disease . Li et al . 270 reported a small - molecule compounds interact with LC3 and mutant HTT but not with wild - type HTT protein , reduce mutant HTT protein and improve phenotype in Huntington’s dis - ease .

The inhibitor JQ1 can bind to their bromod - omain and prevent phase separation . 80 MED1 also forms condensates with estrogen receptor alpha in an estrogen - dependent manner . 94 Tamoxifen is able to inhibit estro - gen production and prevent the formation of the MED1 condensates . 80 Besides , condensates formed by media - tor and TFs are sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors . 93 Ammonium acetate at 100 mM interferes with multiva - lent interactions in the 47 × CAG RNA condensates and further leads to its degradation . 179 Doxorubicin also blocks the formation of CAG RNA condensates in vitro . 179 Together , DNA editing , RNAi , protein degradation , and molecule drugs treatment can regulate phase separation effectively . However , these methods still have off - target 24 of 32 NIU et al . effects with unpredictable and irreversible consequences and the possible impact needs to be carefully consid - ered . The combination of biochemistry and biophysics will greatly benefit the development of new techniques . These technologies can further provide new opportunities for basic and clinical research in related diseases . 7 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES In the past few years , significant progress has been made in the biomolecular condensates . In this review , we high - lighted the importance in elucidating the regulation of biomolecular condensates . Amplification , transcription , translation , and posttranslational modification process at molecular scale , and transport and signal transduction at cellular scale process are all involved in condensates . Numerous diseases were caused by aberrant condensate formation . There are a range of regulatory targets and methods functions depend on the formation and function mechanism of condensates , which provides new oppor - tunities for drug development and clinical treatment of diseases . Biomolecular condensates are emerging as attractive new targets for drug discovery . Many proteins and nucleic acids of high therapeutic value all work in condensates . There have been a series of reports suggesting that conden - sates are druggable . A number of approved drugs such as cisplatin and tamoxifen that have been shown to form con - densates that affect the concentration and activity of the drug . 80 Drug - like molecules that modulate the formation of condensates in a selective manner have been identi - fied by screening . 121 , 276 Posttranslational modification has a strong regulatory effect on the formation and dissolution of condensates . 277 There are a number of small molecules that have completed clinical trials have been able to target condensates ( Table 3 ) . It is tempting to speculate that many other potential drugs may exert their pharmacological benefit by modifying the condensates . However , there are still several issues to be addressed in continued research . First , a large number of proteins should be further examined . Whether they function by forming condensates ? Many proteins with known functions , especially TFs , may be involved in biological processes as condensates . As this hypothesis is tested , we will discover more ways to regulate these proteins . What molecular mechanisms are involved ? Condensates are usually formed from more than one component , and the components do not necessarily interact directly with each other . Exploring the components in condensates will provide new targets for clinical treatment . Second , biomolecular condensates provide a large number of potential drug targets for treatment of diseases , such as aging diseases , and the phase transition of chemotherapeu - tic drugs in cancer treatment . What are the druggability of these targets ? Preliminary evidence has shown that disrupt the assembly and disassembly of these condensates are important in health and disease . In order to fully develop approved drugs for clinical application , further validation of these molecular is needed . Third , how to develop more technologies based on the selective generation or degrada - tion of condensates ? Condensates are involved in a large number of biological functions , however , current regula - tory methods still have side effects . There is an urgent need to integrate other disciplines to develop techniques for more effective intervention in condensate formation and function . Furthermore , the condensates are regulated by multivalent interactions and thermodynamic conditions and have relatively stable material properties . Therefore , it is attractive to develop an easily manipulated condensates system to selectively promote and inhibit the assembly and function of target molecules even if they do not contain IDR . Solving these problems may require drawing on disciplines such as biochemistry and biophysics . These issues must be met to provide novel therapies in the future .
