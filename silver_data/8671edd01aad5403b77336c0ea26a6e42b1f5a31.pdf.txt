Members of the cytokine receptor family are composed of several noncovalently linked chains with sequence and structure homologies in their ex - tracellular domain . Receptor subfamily members share at least one component : thus the receptors for inter - leukin ( IL ) 2 and ILl5 have common ~ and 3 " chains , while those for IL2 , 4 , 7 , and 9 have a common 3 ' chain . The intracellular pathway followed by IL2 receptors after ligand binding and endocytosis was analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal micros - copy in a human T lymphocytic cell line . Surprisingly , the a , ~ , and 3 ' chains had different intracellular localizations after being endocytosed together . The ct chain was always in transferl - in - positive compartments ( early / recycling endosomes ) , both at early and late in - ternalization times , but was never detected in rab7 - positive compartments ( late endosomes ) . On the other hand , at late internalization times , the / 3 and 3 , chains were excluded from transferrin - positive or - ganelles and did not colocalize with ~ . Furthermore , / 3 could be found in rab7 - positive vesicles . These differences suggest that the ot chain recycles to the plasma membrane , while the ~ and 3 ' chains are sorted towards the degradation pathway . The half - lives of these three chains on the cell surface also reflect their different intracellular fates after endocytosis . The and 3 ' chains are very short - lived polypeptides since their half - life on the surface is only = 1 h , whereas c ~ is a much more stable surface protein . This shows for the first time that components of a multimeric receptor can be sorted separately along the endocytic pathway . T rtE cytokine interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) ~ is produced by acti - vated helper T lymphocytes and stimulates prolifera - tion and effector functions of a variety of cells of the immune system ( 36 , 46 , 57 ) . High - affinity IL2 receptors ( Kd = 10 - 100 pM ) consist of three distinct components , the a chain ( IL2Rc ~ , 50 - 55 kD ) , the / 3 chain ( IL2RB , 70 - 75 kD ) and the 3 ' chain ( IL2R , y , 65 kD ) , that are associated in a non - covalent manner ( 36 , 57 ) . Both the / 3 and ~ chains , but not the c ~ chain , belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily ( 1 , 5 ) . This hematopoietic cytokine receptor family includes receptors such as IL3R , IL4R , IL5R , IL6R , IL7R , IL9R , IL15R , the erythropoietin receptor , the granulocyte colony - stimulating factor receptor , the granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor receptor , and the leukemia inhibi - tory factor receptor . This family also includes receptor pro - Address all correspondence to A . Dautry - Varsat , Unite de Biologie de Inter - actions Cellulaires , Institut Pasteur , 25 rue du Dr .

They have an extracellular = 200 - amino acid region of structural homology that is characterized by four conserved cysteine residues in the amino terminal half of this region and a Trp - Ser - X - Trp - Ser motif ( where X is a non - conserved amino acid ) at its carboxy - terminal end . Recently the IL2R ~ chain was found to also participate in the formation of high - affinity forms of IL4 , IL7 , IL9 , and ILl5 receptors ( 19 , 32 , 33 , 39 , 43 , 44 ) . IL2P - , ~ is also a component of the ILl5 receptor ( 19 ) . IL2R3 , plays a critical role in thymic maturation of precursor human T lymphocytes since patients suffering from X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency have a mutation in the gene encoding this IL2R3 , chain ( 9 , 10 , 40 ) . IL2Rc ~ is not expressed on resting cells but is strongly and transiently induced following T cell activation ( 36 , 48 ) . The expression of high - affinity receptors ( IL2Rct / 3 " y ) is transient and is preceded by IL2Rot expression . In addition to high - affinity receptors , activated T lymphocytes express low - affinity receptors ( IL2Rot , K ~ = 10 nM ) and natural killer Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 04 / 55 / 10 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , Number 1 , April 1995 55 - 64 55 cells express intermediate - affinity receptors ( IL2R ~ 3 ' , Kd = 1 nM ) ( 46 , 56 ) . The high and intermediate - affinity receptors are capable oflL2 signaling . None of the IL2 receptor chains has tyrosine kinase activity , but protein tyrosine kinases such as p5e ok , p59 fyn , p53 / 56 ~ ' , and JAKs are associated with IL2 receptors and some have already been shown to be im - plicated in signal transduction ( 2 , 6 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 37 , 43 , 50 , 51 , 58 ) . IL2 receptor stimulation is coupled to ras signaling via Shc and Grb2 ( 41 , 45 , 60 ) . One of the early events that follows IL2 binding to inter - mediate and high - affinity receptors on the cell surface is the internalization of IL2 receptor complexes ( 12 , 46 , 47 ) . As a consequence , high - affinity receptors have a very short half - life on the cell surface , about 30 min in the presence of IL2 ( 11 ) . This short half - life could have been accounted for by the internalization of only one component of the IL2 receptor . This does not appear to be the case , however , since the ct and / ~ chains of high - affinity receptors are internalized together with IL2 . Furthermore , after 10 min endocytosis , the mul - timolecular complex formed between IL2 and the receptor chains is found in endocytic compartments ( 13 , 16 , 18 ) . We have analyzed the intracellular fate of IL2R chains af - ter their internalization . The endocytic compartments were identified using known markers such as transferrin and rab 7 . The intracellular endocytic pathway of transferrin and its receptors has been extensively studied in numerous cell types . Transferrin accompanies its receptor through the re - cycling pathway ( 7 , 30 ) and thus defines early and recycling endocytic organelles . Rab 7 , a member of the rab family of small GTP - binding proteins , has been localized to late en - docytic organelles and is a marker of such late compart - ments ( 3 ) . We have made use of a human tumor cell line , IARC 301 . 5 , which constitutively expresses about 3 , 000 high - affinity IL2 receptors , internalizes IL2 , and proliferates in response to this growth factor . Similarly to normal activated T lympho - cytes , they also express low - affinity receptors ( IL2Ro0 to 5 - to 10 - fold higher levels than high - affinity ( IL2Rc ~ / ~ 3 " ) receptors ( 8 , 11 ) . Here we show that in the absence of protein synthesis , IL2P ~ and 3 , are found in organdies distinct from those containing IL2Rot . IL2Rot is colocalized with transfer - rin after internalization as part of the IL2 - receptor quater - nary complex , and both IL2Rt ~ and transferrin can be found in a pericentriolar recycling compartment ( 34 , 59 ) . Also , IL2Ro ~ is never found in rab 7 - positive compartments . On the other hand , IL2R ~ can be found in late endocytic com - partments containing rab 7 , and IL2R ~ and 3 " colocalize only partly with transferrin . Therefore , it appears that IL2Rt ~ is only found in early and recycling compartments while IL2RB and 3 ' are also detected in late endosomes . In agree - ment with these differences in morphology , we have shown that IL2P - 45 , 3 ' , and ct have different half - lives on the cell sur - face : IL2P - ~ and 3 ' have a short half - life , about 1 h , whereas IL2Ro ~ is very stable , with a half - life of about 48 h ( 24 ) . Thus the components of this multimolecular receptor have a differ - ent intracellular fate after internalization : one of the chains , IL2Rot , recycles to the plasma membrane , while the others , IL2RB and % are destined for degradation . Materials and Methods Cells , Monoclonal Antibodies , and Reagents IARC 301 . 5 is a subclone from a cell line derived from a human T lym - phoma , that expresses high - and low - affinity IL2 receptors ( II , 14 ) . Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 , 10 % fetal calf serum , I0 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , supplemented with glutamine . Monoclonal antibodies 7G ' / Bt , directed against the ~ chain of IL2 recep - tors ( 42 ) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rock - ville , MD ) . The anti - IL2 receptor ~ chain monoclonai antibodies 341 and 561 were kind gifts from Dr . R . Robb ( Dupont Merck Pharmaceutical Co . , Wilmington , DE ) ( 54 ) , and the rat monoclonal antibody against human IL2R3 , , TUGh4 , was kindly provided by Dr . K . Sugamura ( 27 ) . The anti - rab 7 purified rabbit antiserum ( 3 ) was kindly provided by Dr . M . Zerial ( EMBL , Heidelberg , Germany ) . To prepare TRITC - transferrin , human transferrin ( Sigma Chem . Co . , St . Louis , MO ) was iron loaded ( 4 ) and labeled with lissamine rhodamine ( Eastman Kodak ) , as described ( 59 ) . lmmunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Exponentially growing cells , incubated with 50 # M cycloheximide ( Sigma Chem . Co . ) and / or 200 pM IL2 ( Roussel Uclaf , Romainville , France ) and / or TRITC - transferrin and / or antibodies , were washed twice in cold PBS . For all labelings , cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 03 M sucrose for 15 min at 4Â°C . Subsequent steps were performed at room tem - perature . After quenching for 10 min in 50 mM NI - UCI in PBS , the cells were washed once in PBS supplemented with 1 mg / ml bovine serum albu - min , and permeabilized for 15 min at 37Â°C in 0 . 05 % saponin in the buffer used for washing . Cells were then incubated , when indicated , with the first antibody ( ies ) in the permcabiliziog buffer for 1 h . After two washes in this permeabilizing buffer , the presence of antibodies was revealed by incubating the cells for I h in permeabilizing buffer containing labeled second antibod - ies . After three washes in permeabilizing buffer , and one wash in PBS , the cells were mounted in 25 mg / ml 1 , 4 diacylbicyclo ( 2 . 2 . 2 ) octane ( Dabco ; Sigma Chem . Co . ) , 100 mg / mi moviol ( Calbiochem - Behring Corp . , San Diego , CA ) 25 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol , 100 mM Tris - HCi , pH 8 . 5 . For 7GTB6 , an IgG2a , the second antibodies were either FITC - iabeled anti - routine Ig ( 1 / 50 ; Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) or Texas red - labeled anti - IgG2a ( 1 / 25o , Southern Biotechnoiogy , Birmingham , AL ) . For 341 , an IgG ) , the second antibodies were either the same FITC - iabeled antibodies , as above , or FITC - labeled anti - IgGt ( I / t00 ; Southern Biotech - noiogy ) in double labeling experiments with 7G7Bt . For TUGh4 monoclo - hal antibody , the second antibody was FITC - labeled anti - rat antibody ( l / 10o ; Southern Biotechnology ) . For anti - rab7 rabbit antiserum , the sec - ond antibody was TRITC - labeled anti - rabbit Ig ( l / t00 ; Amersham Corp . ) . The samples were examined under a confocal microscope attached to a diaplan microscope equipped with a double laser , Argon - Krypton ( Leica ) . Bleed - through from the FITC channel to the TRITC / Texas red channel was negligible in all experiments . Optical sections were recorded with a 63 x lens and a pinhole aperture such that the thickness of the sections was about 0 . 5 / tm . Photographs were taken on Ilford FP4 and Kodak ektachrome 100 ASA . No immunofluorescence staining was ever observed when second anti - bodies were used without the first antibody or with an irrelevant first an - tibody . Endocytosis of Radiolabeled IL2 Pure recombinant IL2 was radiolabeled with t25iodine by the chloramine T method to specific activities of 360 ttCi / # g . For labeling , three successive additions of chloramine T were performed within 5 rain at room temperature to a final concentration of 25 ~ tg / ml . The reaction was stopped after another 5 rain , and labeled ligand was separated from free t25I by passage through an Excellulose GF - 5 column ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Piscataway , NJ ) . For endocytosis experiments , 2 - 3 x 106 cells were incubated in 100 / ~ l RPMI - Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 10 % FCS , with 200 pM t25I - IL2 at 37Â°C for various times . At the end of the incubation , the cells were washed twice at 4Â°C to remove unbound ligand . They were then subjected to two successive acid pH treatments ( pH 2 . 8 ) to separate cell surface associated from intraceilular t25I - IL2 ( 12 ) . This treatment removed more than 98 % of surface associated t25I - IL2 . Nonspecific binding , measured by adding a 100 - fold excess of the same unlabeled iigand , was < 5 % in every case . The data presented here show specific binding and internalization . The amounts of degraded and undegraded material in medium were de - termined by precipitation of undegraded material with 10 % TCA ( 12 ) . Half - Life Measurements Cell surface expression of IL2P ~ or 3 ' on cells treated for different times The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 56 with 50 # M of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in the presence of 200 pM IL2 was assessed by cytot ] uorimetry . The indicated times are after a 1 h preineubation in cyeioheximide . Surface expression of B and T chains was measured as previously de - scribed by indirect immunotluorescence ( 24 , 25 ) using the murine mono - clonal antibody 341 directed against IL21 ~ followed by phycoerythrine anti - Ig Fab2 ( lmmunotech , Luminy , France ) or the rat monoclonal anti - body TUC _ dt4 directed against IL2R3 , followed by FITC - labeled anti - rat an - tibody ( Southern Bioteclmology ) . Cells were analyzed by flow eytolluorim - etry on a FACScan ( Beetou Dickinson & Co . , Mountain View , CA ) immediately after labeling , and the mean fluorescence intensity was calcu - lated from the recorded data . Results The a Clua ' n of lL2 Receptors Is Not in the Same Endocytic Compartments in T Lymphocytes as the B and . r Chains Previous experiments demonstrated that both the ot and / ~ chains of high - affinity IL2 receptors are internali7e ~ l to - gether with the ligand 03 , 16 ) . To observe the compartments reached by IL2 receptors by endocytosis , and not IL2 recep - tors along the biosynthetic pathway , the T lymphocytic hu - man cell line [ ARC 301 . 5 was incubated with IL2 for 1 h with the protein synthesis inhibitor eycloheximide . We have pre - viously shown that this cycloheximide incubation is suffi - cient to chase out the newly synthesized IL2 receptor chains en route to the cell surface ( 12 , 25 ) . The concentration oflL2 used is sufficient to saturate high - affinity receptors only , and cycloheximide does not inhibit their internalization although it slows it down by a factor two ( 12 , 16 , 25 ) . After the one hour incubation with cycloheximide and IL2 , the cells were fixed and permeabilized , and the ot and / ~ chains were stained with monoclonal antibodies ( IgG2a and IgG1 ) followed by subclass specific anti - Ig labeled with Texas red and FITC , respectively . It was checked that these second antibodies were indeed subclass specific and did not recognize the ir - relevant first antibody . The samples were analyzed by con - focal microscopy . Fig . 1 shows a representative medial op - tical section of IL2Ra staining ( a ) and IL2P - ~ staining ( b ) . When the same experiment was performed in the absence of cycloheximide , the same images were obtained showing that staining of the biosynthetic pathway is very weak ( not shown ) . This double staining experiment showed that IL2Rc ~ and were not colocalized . The intracellular staining was differ - ent for IL2Ra and fl : IL2Ro ~ appeared as a densely stained compartment , while IL21 ~ staining was weak in this com - partment and appeared mostly in vesicles surrounding the compartment defined by IL2Rot . It is worth noting that IL2Rfl was detected only in intracel - lular compartments , while IL2Rc ~ was found both inside the cells and at the plasma membrane . Detection of surface IL2Rot is not surprising since these cells express 5 - 1G - fold more IL2Rot than IL21 ~ . These IL2Rot by themselves con - stitute the so called low - affinity receptors which are not in - ternalized ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 38 ) . Also , IL2Rot could not be found in intracellnlar vesicles in the absence of IL2 , in cells in which protein synthesis had been blocked by cyclohexi - mide ( not shown ) . IL2R ~ is thus internalized only when it is part of high - affinity receptors ( IL2Rc ~ , 8 , and 3 ' ) and not when it forms low - affinity receptors by itself , whether or not IL2 is present . In conclusion , IL2Ra observed intracellu - larly was internalized as a component of the quaternary corn - Figure L Localization of IL2R , ~ , IL2RB , and IL2RT in endocytic vesicles after IL2 endocytosis . The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C in the presence of 50 # M cycloheximide and 200 pM IL2 , and then fixed and permeabilized . IL2Rc ~ and / ~ or - y localizations were then revealed by incubating the cells with anti - IL2R ~ anti - body , 7G7B6 ( IgG2 , ) , together with anti - IL2174 ~ antibody , 341 ( IgG0 or with anti - IL2RT antibody , TUGh4 ( from rat ) followed by Texas red anti - murine IgG2a and FITC anti - murine IgG ~ or FITC anti - rat immunoglobulins .

Until now nothing was known concerning the internaliza - tion of IL2R % since antibodies have become available only recently ( 27 ) . We used the same approach to localize IL2R3 , in endocytic comparmaents as described above for IL2RB and or . Cells in which protein synthesis had been inhibited by cycloheximide were allowed to internalize IL2 . The cells were then fixed and permeabilized , and stained for IL2Ra and 3 ' and analyzed by confocal microscopy . Representative medial optical sections of IL2Roe staining ( c ) and IL2R3 " staining ( d ) are presented in Fig . 1 . IL2R3 " can be observed in intracellular vesicles , and therefore is endocytosed . It is not found in the same compartments as IL2Rot and its intra - cellular distribution resembles that of IL2P - ~ . The t ~ Chain of lL2R Is Restricted to Early , Sorting and Recycling Endosomes During receptor - mediated endocytosis , receptors and ligands are internalized in transport vesicles that deliver their cargo to the endosomal compartment . Some proteins then recycle back to the cell surface while others are sorted to a variety of destinations . The characterization and nomenclature of the endosomal compartments relies on either morphologi - H6mar et al . Sorting of lL2 Receptor Chains during Endocytosis 57 cal , kinetic , or functional considerations , in various cell types . They are at the moment difficult to reconcile ( 53 ) . Transferrin remains bound to its receptor throughout its in - tracellular journey and recycles with a very high efficiency to the plasma membrane . We used TRITC - transferrin to stain the organdies through which it transits , i . e . , the early , sorting , and recycling endosomes . Ligands and receptors destined to degradation are sorted from the transferrin - containing compartments towards late endosomes / prelyso - somes and lysosomes . These late endosomes / prelysosomes are reached by fluid phase tracers after about 30 min , and the small GTP binding protein rab 7 is a specific marker for these compartments ( 3 ) . To define the organelles containing the ct chain of IL2 receptors and to get some insight in its intracellular fate , we have compared its intracellular location with that of these two markers , transferrin and rab 7 . En - docytosis of IL2Rot was probed by internalizing IL2 together with a monoclonal antibody to IL2Rc ~ , 7G ' / B6 .

For this purpose uq - IL2 was incubated for different times at 37Â°C with or without the anti - IL2Rct antibody , under the conditions to be used for confocal microscopy ex - periments . As shown in Fig . 2 , the presence of anti - IL2Rt ~ antibody does not modify the kinetics of IL2 encyto - sis and degradation . To visualize internalized transferrin and IL2Ro ~ , the cells were incubated at 37Â°C with 150 nM TRITC - transferrin , together with IL2 and 7G7B6 antibody . The cells were then washed at 4Â°C , fixed , pcrmeabilized , and incubated with a second FITC - labeled anti - murine Ig anti - body . The samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Representative medial optical sections , after 15 and 100 min incubation with the ligands at 37Â°C , are shown in Fig . 3 . In - tracellular vesicles stained with anti - IL2Rt ~ antibody were always co - stained with TRITC - transferrin , after 15 min as well as after a long time of internalization , 100 rain . After 15 min endocytosis , transferrin and IL2Rct staining appears as small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm . After longer in - cubations , e . g . , 100 min , the appearance of the transferrin and IL2Roe containing compartment had changed and it appeared as a juxta - nuclear compartment . Double staining for IL2Rt ~ or the transferrin receptor after 100 rain ligand endocytosis , and for centrosomes with anti - centrosomal monoclonal antibody , revealed that both IL2Ra and the transferrin receptor were in the pericentrosomal region ( not shown ) . This peri - centrosomal compartment , which con - tains IL2Rc ~ and transferrin receptors after 100 rain endocy - tosis , is probably the peri - centriolar recycling compartment ( 34 , 59 ) . The location of IL2Rct was also compared to that of the late endocytic compartment marker , rab 7 . After 100 rain in - ternalization of IL2 in the presence of 7G7B6 monoclonal an - tibody , the cells were fixed , permeabilized , and stained with anti - rab 7 antibody and then with anti - murine and anti - rabbit Ig labeled with FITC and TRITC , respectively . No colocalization of IL2Rct and rab 7 could ever be detected by confocal microscopy , as seen in Fig . 4 , which shows a repre - sentative medial optical section . In conclusion , IL2Rt ~ was at all times colocalized with transferrin , at early times of internalization in vesicles and at late times in a pericentriolar recycling compartment , and could not be detected together with the late endocytic marker , rab 7 . Therefore , IL2Rot has the characteristics of a recycling receptor . The { 3 Chain of lL2R Is Found in Late / Prelysosomal Compartments The same approach was used to study the location of IL2P43 as that described above for IL2R ~ . Endocytosis of IL2P ~ was probed by internalizing IL2 together with monoclonal antibody 341 directed against IL2P - ~ . This antibody does not inhibit IL2 binding to high - affinity receptors ( 54 ) , nor does it modify IL2 internalization or degradation ( Fig . 2 ) . After 15 rain IL2 and TRITC - transferrin internalization at 37Â°C , IL2Rfl was mainly colocalized with transferrin as shown in Fig . 5 by confocal microscopy . Some vesicles containing IL2R ~ , but not transferrin , could already be observed . After 100 min IL2 and transferrin internalization , transferrin was in the pericentriolar compartment , while IL2R ~ was found The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 58 Figure 3 .

The lo - cation of IL2R / 3 was also compared to that of rab 7 at late internalization times ( 100 min at 37Â°C ) since rab 7 is a marker of late endocytic vesicles . IL2RB was partly colocal - ized with rab 7 ( Fig . 5 ) . In conclusion , at early endocytosis times , IL2R / 3 was mainly colocalized with transferrin , al - though a few vesicles containing only IL2RB were detect - able , and at late endocytosis times the location of IL2R / 3 was distinct from that of transferrin , and in part similar to that of rab 7 . IL2R / 3 , thus , has the characteristics of a receptor routed towards degradation . The . y Chain of IL2R Is Not Colocalized with Transferrin Endocytosis of IL2R - r following IL2 binding was probed with monoclonal antibody TUGh4 . It was verified that this antibody , at the concentration used for immunofluorescence , does not inhibit IL2 binding or modify IL2 internalization and degradation ( Fig . 2 ) . The cells were allowed to internal - ize TRITC - transferrin together with IL2 and TUGh4 for 15 or for 100 min at 37Â°C .

Half - Life of lL2 Receptors The number of cell surface receptors results from the bal - ance between their rates of synthesis , internalization and re - cycling . In the presence of cycloheximide , synthesis is in - hibited , and therefore the number of surface receptors is the net result of degradation and recycling after internalization . We had previously reported that IL2Rot has a very long half - life ( 24 ) , in agreement with IL2Rot recycling after internal - ization . We have now measured the half - life on the cell sur - face of IL2P . ~ on IARC 301 . 5 cells in the presence of IL2 and cycloheximide , after a 1 h preincubation with cyclohexi - mide . Using the same method as described for high - affinity receptors ( 12 ) , we have verified that 1 h cycloheximide pretreatment was sufficient to chase out the internal pool of / 3 chain en route to the cell surface ( not shown ) .

The half - life of IL2Rfl in the presence of IL2 was about 55 min ( Fig . 7 a ) . The same ex - periment was performed to measure the half - life of IL2RT , which was about 70 min ( Fig . 7 b ) . Both half - lives are very short , among the shortest for membrane proteins , and are very similar to the value previously found for high - aftinity IL2 receptors ( 11 ) . The rapid decrease of the number of surface receptors directly reflects their degradation . This biochemical result confirms the data obtained by confocal microscopy , showing that IL2RB and IL2R3 , have character - istics of proteins going through the degradation pathway . Discussion Communication between cells in the immune and hemato - poietic systems is mediated by soluble factors , the cytokines , which exert their biological activities through specific cell surface receptors . The molecular structure of a growing number of cytokine receptors has been determined and led to the definition of a new family of receptors . Cytokines function in a redundant manner , i . e . , the same biological effect can be fulfilled by different cytokines . For instance IL2 , IL4 , or ILl5 may function on the same cell type as long as their receptors are expressed and trigger at least in part the same biological responses ( 20 , 33 , 39 , 44 ) . This redun - dancy can be explained by the composition of cytokine receptors . They Usually consist of ligand specific chain ( s ) and of one or more chains common to several cytokine receptors , which may be involved in signal transduction . The IL2 receptor is a prototype of a cytokine receptor and con - sists of three IL2 binding proteins , or , / 3 , and 3 < IL2RB and 3 , belong to the cytokine family of receptors ; IL2R / 3 is shared by the ILl5 receptor , and IL2R ~ is shared at least by the IL4 , IL7 , IL9 , and ILl5 receptors . Expression of cytokine receptors , because of their func - tion , is usually tightly regulated during development and growth , both at the gene level and by their time of residence at the cell surface . Because of the participation of some of the chains in several receptors , and because cytokine recep - tors form non ~ ovalent multimers , it can be expected that the different chains may behave separately along the secretory and endocytic routes . This would allow for the fine regula - tion of expression of the different receptors . Although the regulation of transcription of IL2 and other cytokine recep - tors has been studied in detail , very little is known about their endocytosis and intracellular fate after cell entry . We have addressed this question in the case oflL2 receptors . We have observed that the IL2 receptor c ~ , / 3 , and 7 chains have different intracellular destinations despite having been inter - nalized together with IL2 . IL2Ro ~ is found only in trans - ferrin - containing compartments at all times of IL2 endocyto - sis , and cannot be detected in compartments stained by anti - rab 7 antibodies , as observed by confocal microscopy . On the other hand , IL2R ~ and IL2R ' y can be found in trans - ferrin containing vesicles at early endocytic times . After prolonged endocytosis , IL2RB is also detected in rab 7 posi - tive organelles . However the proportion of IL2R / 3 in trans - ferrin positive organelles is higher than that in rab 7 positive compartments up to 1 h endocytosis of IL2R / 3 antibodies . This observation may be related to what was observed by H ( ~ mar et al .

Half - lives of IL2R / 3 and IL2R ' t . Cell surface expression of IL2RB ( a ) or IL2R3 , ( b ) on cells treated for different times with 50 / zM cycloheximide and 200 pM IL2 was assessed by cyto - fluorimetry . Times indicated are after a l h preincubation in cyclo - heximide . One representative experiment out of three is shown . subeellular fractionation , which showed that internalized t : 5I - IL2 is mostly found in transferrin - containing endo - somes and not in late / prelysosomal compartments ( 15 ) , al - though it is known that IL2 is degraded after endocytosis . This suggests that IL2 and IL2RB might not accumulate for a long time in these rab 7 positive late / prelysosomal com - partments . The same observation has been reported for epidermal growth factor receptors ( 26 ) . At long times ( 100 min ) of IL2 and transferrin endocytosis , transferrin and IL2Rct are still colocalized in a compartment with a mor - phology different from that observed at early internalization times . We observed this pericentriolar transferrin - contain - ing organelle in T lymphocytes , and it appears very similar to that previously described in other cell types ( 34 , 59 ) . Al - most no IL2R ~ or IL2R7 has ever been observed in this com - partment , which may thus be a specialized recycling com - partment . Taken together , these results suggest that the three chains of IL2R are internalized together as a quaternary complex with IL2 , but are then sorted separately within the cell . However this conclusion holds only if the chains are not in - ternalized independently of each other . We had previously reported that IL2 internalized in endocytic compartments could be cross - linked both to IL2Rct and IL2R ~ , showing that these two chains were internalized forming a complex with IL2 ( 13 ) . In this work , we demonstrate that IL2R3 , is also internalized . This is in agreement with the fact that , in cross - linking experiments , there was an additional band of the expected molecular weight for IL2 cross - linked to IL2R - / ( 13 ) . The following observations further strengthen the view that the chains cannot be internalized separately in the ex - periments reported here . ( a ) The IL2Ra chain is present in excess over the other two chains , raising the possibility that it could be internalized by itself . This is not the case for the following reasons : IL2Rot alone , without / 3 and % can bind IL2 with a Kd = 10 nM , but then it cannot internalize IL2 and is not internalized itself ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 38 ) . Since the IL2 concentration used in the experiments shown here ( 200 pM ) is much less than the Kd , a large majority of IL2Ret on the cell surface have no bound IL2 . Therefore , we also checked the localization of IL2R ~ t in the absence of IL2 : IL2Rc ~ was found only on the plasma membrane , and was never detectable in intracellular vesicles when protein syn - thesis was prevented by cycloheximide ( not shown ) . IL2Ra is thus internalized only when part of high - affinity receptors formed when IL2 is present , Finally , a similar localization of IL2Rtx has been observed in a human natural killer cell line YT 12881 ( not shown ) . This cell line bears receptors formed of IL2RB and IL2R3 ' , and can be induced by ILl to also express IL2Rot in quantities not exceeding those of IL2P - ~ ( 52 ) . ( b ) Concerning IL2R / 3 and " y : it is highly un - likely that , in the presence of IL2 , some of these chains could associate without IL2Rc ~ because of the large excess of this third chain . However , if they did , their association should have been detectable since IL2P , ~ and IL2R - r associate in the presence of IL2 to form receptors of intermediate affinity , Kd = 1 nM ( 49 , 55 ) . We have never been able to detect such receptors on IARC 301 . 5 , although we are capable of mea - suring as little as 100 receptors per cell ( 10 ) . Therefore there is not an excess of IL2R / ~ and 3 ' that would be internalized independently of c ~ in IARC 301 . 5 . Likewise , the same results as reported here for IARC 301 . 5 were obtained with YT # 12881 cells induced to express similar amounts of the three chains ( not shown ) . The different intracellular localizations of the three IL2 receptors chains therefore suggest that they have different in - tracellular fates , IL2Ra recycling to the plasma membrane while / 3 and 3 ' are degraded , and also that their differential sorting occurs in endocytic organelles . The acidic pH of en - dosomes may play a role in this sorting , dissociating IL2 and the receptor ' s components . An expected consequence of sorting is that IL2Ra and IL2P , ~ and IL2R ~ / should have very different half - lives . In - deed , IL2R43 and IL2R3 , have short half - lives on the cell sur - face , 55 and 70 min , respectively ; while we had previously shown that the half - life of IL2Rt ~ is much longer , 48 h in IARC 301 . 5 cells ( 24 ) . In this lymphocytic cell line , as well as in activated T lymphocytes , only about 10 % of surface a chains are part of high - affinity receptors , while the rest of the c ~ chains form low - affinity receptors which are not en - docytosed ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 38 ; and unpublished data ) . We have previously reported that the very long half - life of IL2Rc ~ in IARC 301 . 5 indicates that , following endocytosis , IL2Rc ~ is recycled to the surface ( 24 ) . In cells that do not express more IL2Rct than the other receptor components , one would expect a half - life of about 5 h for IL2Rct , assuming that most The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 62 IL2Rcz returns to the plasma membrane at each internaliza - tion cycle ( with a recycling probability of 0 . 9 ) . We have mea - sured the half - life of IL2Ro ~ , in the presence of IL2 , on the plasnaa membrane of the natural killer human cell line YT 12881 , induced by ILl to express the same amount of IL2Rct as IL2RB . This half - life has the expected value , 5 h ( not shown ) . In conclusion , the different recycling or degradation be - havior of chains of the same receptor that are internalized to - gether allows their cell surface expression to be regulated separately , and adds another level to the modulation due to regulation of gene expression . This allows the expression of high - affinity IL2 receptors to last for a few days , although the transient activation of IL2Rct gene expression following antigen stimulation is short ( IL2Rt ~ mRNA peaks at 6 h after antigen stimulation of T lymphocytes , while IL2RB is con - stantly transcribed ) . Furthermore , some of the chains oflL2 receptors are also part of other cytokine receptors and their different behavior after endocytosis may allow for a fine bal - ance to be achieved between the expression of several cytokine receptors on the same calls . Sorting of proteins takes place in different compartments : the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi cisternae , trans - Golgi net - work , endosomes , and plasma membrane . The cell ma - chinery involved depends on the compartment considered , and is in some cases well understood , while in other cases it remains completely unknown . All sorting processes pre - sumably require sorting signals carried by some of the trafficking molecules . These signals are recognized by the cell machinery and allow the " tagged " molecules to escape from a default pathway and be directed to specific compart - ments . For molecules leaving the endosome , it is usually accepted that recycling occurs by default while a signal is required for them to be directed towards degradation com - partments . No such degradation signal has yet been defined . A sequence in P - selectin has recently provided the first ex - ample of a sequence able to direct a protein towards degrada - tion ( 21 ) . No homology has been found between this sequence and cytoplasmic tails either of other degraded receptors or of IL2RB or 7 . This sequence might cause rapid lysosomal degradation . One of the evoked mechanisms is an aggre - gation of receptors routing them out of the recycling mem - brane ( 35 ) . In the case of IL2 receptors , we have shown that the tx chain follows the default recycling pathway , as does the trans - ferrin receptor . On the contrary , we assume that a degrada - tion signal is associated with the B and / or " t chain . We have previously shown that IL2RB , in the absence of IL2R - r , is internalized and degraded and also has a short half - life , as when IL2RB is part of high - affinity receptors ( 25 ) . This indi - cates that IL2RB itself may carry a degradation signal in - dependently of its association with IL2R - r . Concerning IL2R3 , , it may either carry a degradation signal itself , or re - main associated with IL2RB throughout the sorting process . Finally , the IL2 receptor is now the first multichain recep - tor composed of non - covalently linked subunits which has been shown to be sorted differentially along the endocytic pathway . It will be worthwhile to determine whether this is a general property of the expanding family of cytokine receptors . We are grateful of Dis . R . Robb , K . Sugamura , and M .
