Through text analysis of 68 studies , ten descriptive categories of forms of prototyping and prototype use were constructed to char - acterize the application in PD with older adults : Refine , Evaluate , Motivate , Generate , Explore , Teach , Decide , Communicate , Under - stand , and Contribute . Further analysis examines the prevalence of each category , as well as who participates in these activities . With principal component analysis , we further examine the inter - relationships of these forms of prototyping and prototype use to explore traditions within PD studies with older adults . We conclude by urging PD practitioners to explicitly describe who they include in prototyping and prototype activities , how they are involved , and why . Finally , we invite further discourse on the role of the use of prototypes and prototyping in PD , particularly in PD with older adults , as well as further examination of the concrete context of involvement .

Inclusion of older adults in society and design is often pursued through PD . The extent and manner of inclusion in PD go beyond having users inform a design ; the participants and researchers must co - construct , strive for mutual learning , and ensure that all participants have a say . The approach of prototyping and prototype use in the pursuit of inclusion varies widely , and a better understanding of the diverse application may serve to further advance future PD projects with older adults . A better understanding of prototyping and prototype use with older adults in PD will facilitate our understanding of how older adults are involved in PD , which may differ from other user groups . This review aims to contribute to clarity in prototyping and prototype use to save researchers’ resources , expand design oppor - tunities , and improve design processes for both researchers and participants . The discussion of the fundamental nature and role of prototypes in Lim et al . ( 2008 ) is valuable to advance design methodologies , practice , and thereby design outcomes . Secondly , this review aims to contribute to our understanding of the use of prototypes and prototyping in PD with older adults . Improving this understanding will aid us in furthering the understanding of the use of prototypes and prototyping with older adults in PD , thereby allowing us to assess the inclusion of older adults compared to other groups , and improving our practices , methods , and design processes and outcomes . To pursue these goals , the review takes on the following overarching research question : how are prototypes and prototyping used in Participatory Design with older adults ? 2 BACKGROUND Historically , the use of prototypes has played a central role in bridging various activities of PD processes as well as how we can interpret and evaluate the design outcomes , e . g . , prototypes also hold long traditions as being among the expected results of a design project ( Kensing , Simonsen , Bødker , 1998 ) , and can serve as tools for both exploration and assessment ( Bødker & Grønbæk , 1991 ) . For PD in particular , working prototypes can help the participants better understand , reflect , and engage in future changes , including more complex matters such as power relations and political views ( Hillgren et al . 2011 , p . 174 ) . This paper concerns both prototyping as an activity and the use of prototypes as concrete manifestations . 2 . 1 Prototypes The role of prototypes has been thoroughly discussed within both PD and adjacent research communities such as HCI . Looking back 169 PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Harald Maartmann - Moe and Suhas Govind Joshi at a classic definition by Houde & Hill ( 1997 ) , prototypes can be understood as " any representation of a design idea , regardless of medium " ( p . 3 ) . While the understanding of the role and purpose of prototypes have been further nuanced in later design - oriented research , e . g . , by Lim et al . ( 2008 ) , Wensveen & Matthews ( 2014 ) , or ( Odom et al . , 2016 ) , what remains true in our opinion is that the exact expectations and purposes still depend on the intentions behind the prototypes ( Houde & Hill , 1997 ) , p . 2 ) . How we use prototypes within a PD project will likely yield very different processes for the stakeholders as well as unique outcomes from the process . Within PD traditions , prototypes have served as enablers of shared spaces for co - design and continuous influence but also as reflective tools that modify everyday practice . Prototypes can also contribute to operationalizing underlying PD principles , such as voicing participants . For instance , Björgvinsson et al . ( 2010 ) and Joshi ( 2017 ) discuss the role of prototypes in expanding the space and time of the participation . The prototypes’ ability to help participants experience the future rather than relying solely on their imagination has also been raised as a critical point . Bratteteig and Wagner suggest that an essential metric of a project outcome in PD should ideally be its ability to be evaluated in representative everyday situations ( Bratteteig & Wagner , 2016 , p . 142 ) , and in such evaluations , prototypes are often crucial . Co - designing working prototypes that can be deployed as part of PD initiatives continue to be among the concerns raised by Bødker & Kyng ( 2018 ) as they discuss crucial criteria for success in PD . 2 . 2 Prototyping Seminal literature describing generic PD models , e . g . , Sanders and Stappers ( 2008 ) or Bratteteig et al . ( 2012 ) , mention prototyping or concretizing / materializing as specific activities central to the pro - cess . Since early PD , both low - tech and collaborative prototyping has been used as a means to enable participants directly in design activities ( Muller et al . 1993 , p . 27 ) . With time , the role of prototyp - ing as an activity has evolved and is further discussed within PD . For instance , the concept of " design in use " ( Dittrich et al . , 2002 , p . 125 ) can highlight one example of prototyping as an activity that uncovers complexities unknown or un1d in earlier stages of the PD process . Brodersen et al . ( 2019 , pp . 6 - 7 ) illustrate a similar point by describing two types of prototyping , namely cooperative prototyping , and prototyping as reflection , nuancing two examples of different roles prototypes may hold in PD prototyping practice . Beyond the experimental role , prototyping can also be seen as a means of inquiry without necessarily considering it an early mani - festation of a product ( Wensveen & Matthews , 2014 ) . Even iterative processes that generate feature - rich representations can serve mul - tiple roles , e . g . , as " hypotheses , potential solutions to the design challenges defined in the process " ( Leinonen et al . 2008 , p . 68 ) . 2 . 3 PD with older adults This study focuses on older adults as their inclusion in society and design has historically been inadequate and a stronger focus on their inclusion is appropriate ( Joshi , 2017 ) . With PD projects in - volving older adults , it has been specifically argued that the role of prototyping might be even more critical in arriving at a final design outcome that reflects the needs and perspectives of the par - ticipants ( Orso et al . , 2015 , p . 102 ) . Furthermore , PD projects with prototypes can offer more opportunities for design strategies , e . g . , allowing older adults to age together with prototypes ( Botero , p . 46 ) . A challenge outlined by Grönvall and Kyng ( 2013 , p . 390 ) is that diverging perspectives among the participants require considera - tion and adaptation . Including older adults in prototyping activities can answer this call by combatting the stereotyping of older adults as a homogenous user group without offering any nuances to a more in - depth understanding of motives and interests . For instance , prototyping fictional characters can challenge assumptions among participants ( Blythe et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly , Lindsay et al . ( 2012 , p . 1200 ) raise the point that prototyping activities can confront typical ageist stereotypes on technology acceptance The term older adults refer to a substantial and increasing part of the population . Vines et al . ( 2012 ) utilize the term eighty somethings as a useful and neutral term to further specify who participates and highlight the significant heterogeneity within this group . Similarly , the diversity within a specific and narrow age range is highlighted by Frennert & Östlund ( 2016 ) who find that participants differ - entiate themselves from other “old people” . Specifying exact age groups may be desirable in certain cases , but we support the po - sition that great differences exist within all groupings based on age . Accordingly , this review does not attempt to deny or minimize the heterogeneity of the participants , rather , the presented review intends to build a broader understanding of the involvement of older adults in prototyping and prototype use in PD . 3 METHOD This review utilizes the procedure proposed by Budgen & Brereton ( 2006 ) . The four following subsections of this chapter correspond to the four steps they propose . 1 . Define a review protocol with research questions and meth - ods employed for assessment . 2 . Define a search strategy and document it . 3 . Specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria . 4 . Specify the information that will be obtained from each item . 3 . 1 Research question and methods for assessment This study performs a systematic literature review of PD literature involving older adults , including prototyping or prototype use . To structure the review , we narrowed down our overarching research question with three subquestions : • How are prototypes and prototyping used in Participatory Design with older adults ? ⃝ What forms of prototype use and prototyping are used in PD with older adults ? ⃝ Who participates within these forms of use ? ⃝ How are these forms combined ? The studies’ prototyping and prototype use is understood through text analysis and condensed into descriptive forms of use . These forms of use are then utilized to examine who participates within each form of prototyping and prototype use : researchers , older adults , or both ? The occurrences of forms are then examined 170 Prototyping and Prototype use in Participatory Design with older adults PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Table 1 : Database search implementation Database field Operator Term Comment Subject AND " Participatory Design " To focus on studies that contribute to Participatory Design as a field .

This translates to three necessary elements : 1 . PD 2 . Older adults 3 . Prototyping or prototype use Translating these three elements into a search , this review only includes studies with the terms “Participatory Design” and “older adults” in their subject . Prototyping and prototypes do not have to be the focus of a paper to be valuable in this review . These studies still provide insight into the use of prototypes and prototyping without the intention of contributing to concepts or practices sur - rounding prototyping . Table 1 shows the detailed implementation of the search . The search was performed in January 2021 using the available databases for the University of Oslo through the Oria catalog ( UiO University of Oslo Library , 2021 ) , which provided 76 results . In the Oria catalog , “Subject” is the sum of the title , key - words , and abstract . A supplementary search was performed in AMCs digital library using the same criteria and filtering of the re - sults to publications in Participatory Design Conference ( PDC ) . The supplementary search did not include the requirement of “Participa - tory Design” , as inclusion in PDC ensures that PD is in focus . This supplementary search provided four results , which were included in the analysis after the formation of the ten categories presented in section 3 . 6 . These searches thereby omit studies with older adults that do not mention “prototyping” or “prototype” . This restriction makes the review manageable , but also unfit to comment on the overall prevalence , or lack thereof , of prototyping in the entirety of PD with older adults . Rather , the focus of this review is to examine the different ways prototyping and prototypes are used . 3 . 3 Search inclusions and exclusions Studies that only take “inspiration” from PD are excluded as they do not aim to contribute directly to PD literature . However , studies that utilized “PD methods” are included , even though their methodology might differ from PD . Explicitly proposed , intended , and planned activities in PD processes that have not been carried out are also valuable in building an understanding of prototyping and prototype use in PD with older adults . Therefore , these activities will also be included in the review and analysis marked in the initial data with an asterisk “ * ” in section 0 . Eight of the 76 initial results were excluded . The remaining 68 studies constitute the primary data of this review . 3 . 3 . 1 Older adults . As discussed in section 2 ( PD with older adults ) , the diversity within any age range is significant . Still , it is natural to define some form of the age range in a review on PD with older adults . Therefore , we have aligned us with the retirement age in Norway as a more objective boundary in delimiting this review . In this review , the term “older adults” refer to people older than 67 years . Studies that do not involve people older than 67 years as participants will therefore be excluded from this review . The 67 - year boundary also aligns with other reviews such Orso et al . ( 2015 ) . With this broad lower boundary , the group of people involved as participants is large and heterogeneous . This makes it difficult to maintain the concrete context in which the participants are involved , yet this allows the review to examine the overall characteristics in PD prototyping and prototype use involving older adults . A related challenge in structuring review in this way is that the researchers’ intentions in includ - ing older adults may not be explicit , and therefore not addressable . Including and examining the researchers’ intentions in involving older adults would be a valu - able perspective to combine with this review . 3 . 3 . 2 Prototyping and Prototypes . The broad approach in reach - ing studies with older adults is also applied in reaching literature on prototyping and prototypes . In this review , a prototype is any representation of a design idea regardless of medium . Prototyping is any modification of these representations . Studies are not ex - cluded if their definition or view on prototypes and prototyping is different . However , studies are excluded if they do not prototype or use prototypes , as determined by this review’s definitions . A more specific definition of prototypes and prototyping would also be 171 PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Harald Maartmann - Moe and Suhas Govind Joshi Figure 1 : The year and journal / conference each study in the primary data was published in . valuable . However , we would risk excluding studies with opposing views , thereby shaping the results of our review on prototyping and prototype use towards our definitions . We , therefore , maintain broad definitions of prototypes and prototyping as well . 3 . 4 Search results The 68 studies were published in 47 unique conferences and journals ( Figure 1 ) , where CHI tops the number of studies published in nine publications . The 68 studies are primarily geographically located in Europe and the US areas . The lack of diversity and representation beyond these geographical areas and their populations limits the extension of this study’s implications to comment on Euro - American experi - ences and practices . Further searches in additional databases would contribute with valuable perspectives . 3 . 5 Procedure To understand the use of prototypes and prototyping in PD with older adults , we rely on the descriptions by the authors in the 68 studies . For instance , authors utilize terms such as “demonstrate” , “visualize” , or “to collect feedback” , which all imply certain inten - tions . The different descriptions of prototype and prototyping activi - ties were then summarized , grouped , and condensed into categories . In the text analysis , we strived to maintain the significant distinc - tions of prototyping and prototype use , e . g . , the difference between “refine” and “evaluate” which is further discussed in section 3 . 6 . 2 . This more concise set of categories of prototype and prototyping use was then used to categorize each study , also noting whether older adults ( OA ) , researchers ( R ) , or both ( OA & R ) took part in the prototype / prototyping use . This categorization of the 68 studies was then further analyzed with exploratory factor and correlation analysis . These statistical methods are valuable in understanding the interrelations of forms of prototyping and prototype use , as well as in discovering possible underlying factors or “forms” that would better characterize use . The factors produced through the statistical analysis in turn support the creation of a more concise descriptive set of categories of the use prototypes and prototyping in PD with older adults . The statistical method utilized is principal component analysis ( PCA ) , which has proved valuable in many fields , such as personality psychology where the five - factor model ( FFM ) , or “Big Five” , emerged ( Wiggins , 1996 ) . Though , limitations in the application of PCA have been highlighted by Hopke & Jaffe ( 2020 ) , who recommend more modern methods that allow for “proper weighting of individual data points” . Still , they confirm the value of PCA as an exploratory tool , which fits the intentions of PCA application in this review . The set of studies used in this review is presumably not sufficient for statistically sound generalized factors . Rather , the principal component analysis is used to construct deeper insight into the interrelations of the primary data in this review . This helps us understand how different forms of prototyping are combined . 3 . 6 Categories What forms of prototype use and prototyping are used in PD with older adults ? To begin answering the first research question , we utilize text analysis to create a descriptive set of categories . The authors’ de - scriptions in the 68 studies were analyzed to formulate a concise set of categories that describe the diverse ways the researchers utilized prototyping and prototypes . These categories are intended as a purely descriptive set to characterize these studies and are presented in Table 2 : Categories of Prototype use and Prototyping in PD with older adults . 3 . 6 . 1 Refine . The category Refine refers to the use of prototyping or prototypes to converge a design . Opening up for new directions or significant changes is discouraged . The prototype or prototyping restricts design decisions intending to complete or adjust a design . 25 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or prototyping to Refine a design . We see one example of this form of prototyping and prototype use in Lorraine James & Saville - Smith ( 2018 ) who include a “Tool testing and refining” phase : 172 Prototyping and Prototype use in Participatory Design with older adults PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Table 2 : Categories of Prototype use and Prototyping in PD with older adults Category Related terms Refine Converge , Finalize , Adjust a precursor to a product Evaluate Feedback , Validate , Test , Verify , Criticize Motivate Induce enthusiasm , Inspire Decide Design , Change Generate Ideate , Inspire Explore Try out , Experiment , Experience Teach Explain , Demonstrate , Convey knowledge Communicate Articulate , Shared Understanding , Represent , Visualize , Clarify , Demonstrate Understand Investigate , Gain insight , Test , Think with , Experience Contribute Practical contribution , Research contribution , Results [ . . . ] participants were presented with an early proto - type of the tool and all aspects of it were intensively workshopped over two - three hours . Then participants tested successive versions of the tools in their homes or applied them to real - life situations and provided feedback . These activities were essential in improving the relevance and user - friendliness of the tools . Here , older adults finalize a prototype . This suggests that the activity did not allow major changes but sought refinements of a de - sign . Utilizing prototypes to refine a design is a natural application towards the end of a design process . Refine opposes both Generate and Explore as participants do not get the opportunity to provide significant creative contributions in a design process , their power is limited by the prototype they are refining . 3 . 6 . 2 Evaluate . Most studies used prototypes to assess a design’s subjective quality , usability , or fit with needs . The quality of a design is discussed through the evaluation of a prototype according to the criteria set by those who arrange the activity . Orso et al . ( 2015 ) ask users to build an understanding of the us - ability and their satisfaction with prototypes and then communicate the understanding : «During the SeniorChannel project [ . . . ] When early prototypes were ready , users evaluated their usability . Finally , users expressed their satisfaction with the final prototypes . » 46 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Evaluate a design . Evaluate overlaps with both Communicate and Understand as the evaluating party is asked to build an understanding of a design and its use , through a prototype . This understanding is then com - municated and related to the criteria defined by the party arranging the Evaluation activity . 3 . 6 . 3 Motivate . Prototyping and prototypes are used to encourage participation through creating engagement , joy , interest , or en - thusiasm . Prototypes and prototyping may also be used to inspire participants by demonstrating the potential value of participation , e . g . , through successful prototypes or processes . Richards ( 2017 ) describes how they built “Prototype Exemplars” to Motivate : “The researchers mastered two crafts and created artifacts to serve as motivating examples for older adult participants in future participatory design work - shops . ” 5 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or prototyp - ing to Motivate in design . 3 . 6 . 4 Generate . When prototypes and prototyping is used to Gen - erate , the goal is to facilitate ideation . Prototypes may be used to inspire and teach people about possibilities , expanding the de - sign space and preventing people from dismissing their ideas and directions . The aim is to create ideas . Cozza et al . ( 2016 ) infer that having participate participants com - ment on prototypes sparked design “proposals” : “Participants commented on them [ the “devices” ] one by one , by highlighting possible aesthetic , social , and gender issues . Comments and proposals of alternative solutions contributed to subvert a stereotypical image of older people as compliant , frail , and technologically inexperienced” “Prototype exemplars” were utilized by ( Orso et al . , 2015 ) to inspire support ideation : “The artifacts created by the researchers show the endless possibilities using LilyPad Arduino microcon - trollers” . 22 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Generate . 3 . 6 . 5 Decide . When prototyping and prototypes are used to De - cide , the Participants in these activities further define and determine a design that the process will move forwards with . Decisions made with prototypes or in the prototyping of designs that are not con - sidered as potential design outcomes fall outside of this category as the participants are not affecting the design process , exerting power . The power involved in modifying the actual design ( s ) is a requirement for this category of use . Power is shared through accessible representations . This cate - gory aligns with the perspective on design as decisions as discussed by Bratteteig & Wagner ( 2014 ) . In Botero & Hyysalo ( 2013 ) , older adults used prototypes to further determine the foremost design of the process , and the changes were the basis of the process moving forwards : Designers received a request with a link to the ‘ex - ample’ [ made by older adults ] , asking whether it was 173 PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Harald Maartmann - Moe and Suhas Govind Joshi possible to make a ‘copy’ of the recipe book so that they could use it as a bulletin board in case there were no resources to implement one . This set the scene for a joint workshop in which we sketched what could be implemented [ Figure ] . The recipe book thus seeded the development of evolutionary design Fischer and Ostwald ( 2002 ) Deicde has similarities to the category Generate , as designs take shape within both forms of use . However , in Generate the ideas and designs are being used as inspiration , practice , or a way to take input from the activity participants . 14 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Decide . 3 . 6 . 6 Explore . Prototypes and prototyping are used to try out , or experience designs and design elements . This category is in many ways close to “Generate” as many ideas or prototypes are involved . The aim of Explore is not to produce many ideas , the aim is to experience ideas and learn . Kopec et al . ( 2018 ) propose their SPIRAL model which urges “Direct involvement with technology” . An example of an activity which positively introduced older adults into the mobile technology usage was a location - based game [ 21 ] . ” . 15 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Explore . 3 . 6 . 7 Teach . Prototypes or prototyping is used to develop knowl - edge in one party , that the other party is already familiar with and believes to be true and useful . Guerrero et al . ( 2019 ) report that “older adults and caregiver participated in sessions of hands - on use of the prototype , partly to provide them experience of the new technology so that they could further contribute to the design process and partly to test a set of instruments . ” Rodil et al . ( 2014 ) provide an example of this form of prototype use : “ [ Figure ] shows the elders using the cards to explain who partakes in negotiation and where it takes place” Cards are used by older adult participants to teach researchers about their traditions . This is one of the few studies in this review where older adults use prototypes to teach researchers . Teach has a strong similarity to communicate yet Teach differs as the knowledge already “exists” in one party , and not the other , shaping the power dynamic . 10 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Teach . 3 . 6 . 8 Communicate . Prototypes or prototyping serve as tools to convey ones’ thoughts . Lindsay et al . ( 2012 ) report an example of prototyping to Communicate : “This meeting lets participants ar - ticulate their requirements around functionality , aesthetics , and experience of a specific design as they engage in low - fidelity pro - totyping work . ” . Brookfield et al . ( 2020 ) also view prototyping as a communication process “Model - making is a creative , visual method of design communication [ 33 ] . We employed this method at our co - design workshops in Hackney Wick and Kirkwall . ” . 24 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Communicate . 3 . 6 . 9 Understand . Prototypes and prototyping are used to build an understanding of something . Many of the other categories also build on Understanding and Investigation , e . g . , Teach , Communi - cate , Evaluate . However , this category describes the construction of knowledge in one party and using prototypes and prototyping to get an answer to something that is not covered by the other cate - gories . This form of use can be seen in Khan et al . ( 2010 ) who used “prototype testing” to “reveal [ ed ] that participants did not want to reconcile their medication lists even if they knew that their doctors cannot perform medication reconciliation” . Researchers created a better understanding of challenges through the use of prototypes . This form of use can also be seen in Rice & Alm ( 2008 ) “Paper prototyping and brainstorming sessions provided further evidence as to how older people perceived using a two - way communication application . ” . Rice & Alm ( 2008 ) use paper prototyping with brainstorming to better understand the way participants perceive a two - way com - munication application , i . e . , they build an understanding through prototype use . Van Velsen et al . ( 2019 ) utilized prototyping with participants to «gather requirements»i . e . , determine what the system should do “Based on the co - designs and the participants’ presentation of their work , 58 requirements were drafted . These 58 requirements were prioritized , based upon the urgency with which the participants mentioned a wish . ” . This use of prototyping has similarities to the category Decide as they made design decisions for their prototypes . However , the participants’ prototypes were used by the researchers to understand the wishes of participants , rather than as the basis of the design moving forwards . 37 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or proto - typing to Understand . 3 . 6 . 10 Contribute . The prototyping or prototypes themselves are used as contributions . Researchers present their prototype as a research contribution to exemplify and summarize their design guidelines , similar to annotated portfolios ( Gaver & Bowers , 2012 ) and archetypes . This is categorized as “Contribution , Researcher” . Alternatively , researchers leave prototypes with participants as they are directly useful in the participants’ lives , this is categorized as “Contribution , Older Adult” . Menschner et al . ( 2011 ) utilize prototypes as a direct contribution «propose the NuTrack prototype as a novel design artifact result - ing from the AALSDA application . » . And Vimarlund et al . ( 2008 ) highlight how their research created prototypes that have a direct practical contribution for older adults through clinical practice : “The project resulted in a number of working prototypes to be used in clinical practice such as a virtual health record , a virtual care plan and a web - service to elderly patients and their relatives» 6 of the 68 studies in this review utilized prototypes or prototyp - ing to Contribute . 4 RESULTS Who participates , and how ? Table 3 presents the results of our analysis which examined which forms of prototyping and prototypes use each study utilized , as well as who participated in the prototyping activities . “OA” is short for Older Adults , and “R” is short for Researcher / Designer .

However , this does not assure that both older adults and researchers collaborated within the same activity . The colors correspond to who participated to give a visual overview . The typical study utilized prototypes prototyping in three ways . The highest number of different categories of uses can be seen in Maaß & Buchmüller ( 2018 ) and Botero & Hyysalo ( 2013 ) , where they used seven of these ten categories . Eleven of the 68 papers ( 16 % ) did not use prototypes and prototyping beyond Refinement and Evaluation . 4 . 1 How are prototypes and prototyping used ? Figure 2 provides a count of who participated within each category of prototype and prototyping use , as well as the category’s preva - lence in the 68 studies . The most common form of prototyping and prototype use with older adults is Evaluation , 67 % of the studies included older adults in this manner . More than half of the studies also used prototypes and / or prototyping to Understand . The least common form of use was to Motivate . Only 7 % of studies , and only older adults , used prototypes / prototyping to Motivate . The forms of application of prototypes and prototyping were then examined in relation to each other . Table 4 presents a cor - relation matrix for the occurrences of prototyping and prototype use in the studies . Examining how categories of prototyping and prototype use are combined sheds light on potential overlapping and connected categories , forms of prototyping and prototype use that are combined or belong within the same traditions . The intention is not to generalize these numbers to all prototype use in PD with older adults , but to better understand the primary data and analysis of this review . The strongest positive correlations were between Explore & Gen - erate , Explore & Teach , and Motivate & Teach . There were fewer strong negative correlations , the strongest two being 1 ) Communi - cate & Evaluate , and 2 ) Teach & Refine . These forms of prototype and prototyping use are further ex - plored with principal component analysis , which aims to explore potential underlying factors . E . g . , if Generate and Explore were two manifestations of a single underlying category , this category would likely manifest as a “component” in the principal component anal - ysis which would serve in constructing a concise set of categories that can be used to analyze and describe the use of prototypes and prototyping in PD with older adults . In this review , principal component analysis is applied primarily to better understand the 68 studies’ prototyping and prototype use in PD with older adults . The three strongest components are presented in Table 5 as they account for 50 % of the variation . The first three components produced by the principal component analysis account for 50 % of the variance , i . e . , these three compo - nents could replace the ten categories ( Table 2 ) and still explain 50 % of the occurrences of prototyping and prototype use in PD with 176 Prototyping and Prototype use in Participatory Design with older adults PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Figure 2 : Prevalence and composition of prototype and prototyping use in PD with older adults Table 4 : Correlation matrix for prototyping and prototype use .

Reducing the ten categories to three would be a substantial improvement in concision , but this would not be able to account for the other 50 % of the total variation . The first three components do adequately replace the set of ten categories . Still , three components give us insight into the inner groupings of the categories in the primary data . This , in turn , builds our under - standing of the applications of prototyping and prototype use in PD with older adults . 5 ANALYSIS This review constructed ten categories to describe the uses of pro - totyping and prototypes in PD with older adults . The categories themselves ( Table 2 ) provide insight into the diversity of forms of use of prototypes and prototyping . By examining how often each category of prototyping and proto - type use is applied , as well as who participates within each category ( Figure 2 ) , we better understand how prototyping and prototype 177 PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Harald Maartmann - Moe and Suhas Govind Joshi Table 5 : Three components produced by principal component analysis that can characterize the prototyping and prototype use Component 1 Component 2 Component 3 Refine 0 , 59 0 , 564 Evaluate - 0 , 188 0 , 247 0 , 663 Motivate 0 , 554 - 0 , 198 Generate 0 , 707 0 , 236 Explore 0 , 687 - 0 , 161 0 , 237 Teach 0 , 64 - 0 , 333 Decide 0 , 674 - 0 , 288 Communicate 0 , 342 0 , 319 - 0 , 65 Understand 0 , 372 0 , 51 Contribute - 0 , 258 - 0 , 34 0 , 104 use is a part of PD with older adults . The most common form of prototype and prototyping use is Evaluation and the inclusion of older adults in this use of prototypes and prototyping is high ( 99 % within the category , or 67 % of all studies ) . Just 20 % of the studies used prototypes and prototyping to directly Decide with the partic - ipants . More than half of the studies also used prototypes and / or prototyping to Understand . The least common form of use was to Motivate at 7 % . Eleven of the 68 papers ( 16 % ) did not use prototypes and prototyping beyond Refinement and Evaluation . 80 % of the studies did not utilize prototyping or prototypes to have older adults directly Decide . However , Evaluation , Explo - rations , and similar activities with participants may also allow participants to influence the design if participants propose design ideas that the researchers or designers respect . However , with these activities the researchers may act as filters for participant ideas , only allowing or moving forwards with what they value , prevent - ing participants from having a say in the design . Thus , 20 % of the papers presumably had genuine participation , and the number is likely higher the other studies similarly respected and valued par - ticipant contributions , yet this is not explicitly stated in the studies in prototyping activities . Having participants directly change or create a design is not participatory if the participants have not had the opportunity to learn about design , decisions , and the effects . In the same manner that consent to participate in research is not valid unless it is informed , we argue that a design decision is not participatory unless it is informed . Participants’ mutual learning is essential in PD processes . 15 % of the studies used prototypes & pro - totyping to teach participants . This would also be alarmingly low , however , the number of studies that strive for mutual learning is likely higher , as one can teach without prototypes and prototyping , and without explicitly describing the purpose as “teach” . E . g . , Gen - erate and Evaluate presumably leads to participants constructing design knowledge . Additionally , the form Understand when used by participants , has a similar result : participants develop design knowledge . 80 % of studies used prototyping or prototypes in more ways than Evaluation and / or Refine , suggesting that most PD with older adults includes participants beyond the role of informants . When examining how these forms of prototype and prototyping were applied and combined in the 68 studies ( Table 4 ) , the strongest positive correlations were between : 1 . Explore & Generate 2 . Explore & Teach 3 . Motivate & Teach The correlation between Explore and Generate is presumably stronger as activities including one naturally could include the other . Using prototypes to Explore , i . e . , try out many different ideas could naturally spark the creation of new ideas , i . e . , Generate . Using a prototype to Generate ideas typically involves trying out prototypes . The correlation between Explore & Teach may be natural as they both aim to build understanding . Still , Teach differs as it described the “transfer” of knowledge from one party to another , and it does not necessarily involve Explorations . The correlation in the use of Motivate and Teach could be ex - plained by the increased need for motivation when asking partici - pants to take part in learning , which may be tedious . There were fewer negative strong correlations , the strongest two being 1 . Communicate & Evaluate 2 . Teach & Refine Prototyping and prototypes are rarely used to Communicate and Evaluate within the same study . There are many possible ex - planations for these negative correlations . ( 1 ) They can replace each other , ( 2 ) they do not fit in the same type of study , or ( 3 ) they belong to different prototyping and prototype use traditions . Of the few strong negative correlations , we saw that Communicate & Evaluate and Teach & Refine were rarely combined . The lack of utilization of both Communication and Evaluation within the same study could be a result of researchers finding each of these categories to sufficiently replace the other , or that they belong to different traditions / methodologies . The likelihood of not seeing prototyping and prototype use to Communicate and Evaluate to - gether in studies could be related to a newer view of prototypes as tools beyond Evaluation and Refinement which are more common in User - Centered Design ( UCD ) . Utilizing a prototype to teach par - ticipants is vastly different from using participants to finetune a design . The differences could be related to a fundamental difference in view on participants : informants or co - designers . When interpreting correlations , two categories stand out from the rest . 178 Prototyping and Prototype use in Participatory Design with older adults PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom 1 ) Understand correlates somewhat to all other categories ex - cept for Evaluate . The lack of combination of Evaluate and Understand could suggest that they both serve the same purpose . 2 ) Contribute does correlate positively to any category . The rest of the categories have both positive and negative correla - tions . This could suggest that studies who Contribute using prototypes or prototyping do not find the rest of the forms of use compatible , or that this work is published separately . The principal component analysis presents three components that aim to equivalently describe and categorize the data and cat - egories presented in section 4 . 50 % of the variance would still be accounted for when using these three components to describe the prototyping and prototype use . The three components give insight into groups of forms of prototype and prototyping use which , are akin to traditions within the studies in the primary data of this review . Muriana & Hornung’s ( 2017 ) study used prototypes and proto - typing to Generate , Explore , Teach , and Motivate which fits well with the first component : Generate , Explore , Teach , Motivate , and somewhat Understand and Communicate . Component two consists of Decide , Refine , Understand , Com - municate , and the absence of both Teach and Contribute , which fits well with Botero & Hyysalo ( 2013 ) . Evaluate , Refine , and the absence of Communicate constitutes the third component where studies such as Joshi ( 2019 ) , Nilsson et al . ( 2020 ) , Ferati et al . ( 2018 ) , Sorgalla et al . ( 2017 ) all fit . 6 DISCUSSION This review aimed to answer the research questions - • How are prototypes and prototyping used in Participatory Design with older adults ? ⃝ What forms of prototype use and prototyping are used in PD with older adults ? ⃝ Who participates within these forms of use ? ⃝ How are these forms combined ? To answer how prototypes and prototyping is used , i . e . , with what intent and effect , this review analyzed and arrived at a set of categories describing the differing forms of prototype and prototype use : Refine , Evaluate , Motivate , Generate , Explore , Teach , Decide , Communicate , Understand , and Contribute . These categories pro - vide insight into the different forms of use of prototypes and proto - typing in the selected papers . The prevalence of each form of use is examined and summarized in Figure 2 , as well as who participates within each of these forms . Figure 2 in itself offers insight into possibly unexplored applications of prototyping and prototypes . Older adults are primarily involved through Evaluation , and less often to decide . It seems that the involvement of older adults in prototyping and prototype use in PD is guided by designs that have already taken shape . Evaluation through prototypes or prototyping is valuable , however , we argue that maintaining this as the primary way to involve older adults in PD may be problematic . Involvement in the formative stages of design and sharing the power to decide in Design is vital in PD with older adults . It would be interesting to further examine this , and discuss whether this aligns with PD , or how older adults want to be involved . There are several forms of use where researchers or older adults rarely are involved . Utilizing prototyping and prototypes to have older adults Teach researchers , not just evaluate a design , may be unexplored and a valuable explo - ration . One could argue that it is demanding to ask participants to teach researchers , still , mutual learning is essential in PD , therefore it is also vital to provide participants with the tools to teach . This review has utilized broad definitions of prototyping and prototypes to examine the current state of their application within PD with older adults . With a broad view on prototyping and pro - totype use , a lack of prototyping activities with older adults could imply to a lack of inclusion of older adults in PD . Fortunately , these studies may have involved older adults in design in other ways . Although the creation of prototypes is common , few studies use concrete prototypes as direct contributions to participants . This is possibly related to the challenges and resources necessary to transform prototypes that were used and created to be tools in a design process into long - term sustainable products . It would be unfitting to demand that all design processes should leave behind prototypes that improve the lives of participants , as ensuring that prototypes function independently requires a lot of resources . Still , giving something back to participants is vital , and this fits well with a criteria for success in PD discussed by Bødker & Kyng ( 2018 ) who advocate co - designing working prototypes that can be deployed as part of PD initiatives . The different forms of prototyping and prototype use are often combined , and some patterns have been suggested through the examination of correlation and PCA . The three components pro - duced by PCA may suggest three different practices of prototype and prototyping use in PD with older adults : 1 . Generate , Explore , Teach , Motivate , and somewhat Under - stand and Communicate . 2 . Decide , Refine , Understand , Communicate , and the absence of both Teach and Contribute 3 . Evaluate , Refine , and the absence of Communicate On its own , the third component seems to fit better with User Centered Design , than the focus of PD . However , Evaluate and Re - fine are immensely helpful in any design process and the inclusion of participants . These forms of inclusion may be less straining for participants , and may therefore be widely used . This would be a considerate explanation . Still , participation through Evaluation and Refine limits the power and potential contributions of participants . These three possible “traditions” may also be three different natural types of studies to publish or perform . Documenting and publishing the entirety of design processes may be too compre - hensive and may not fit well with a focused and concise scientific contribution . This review has not examined the motivations in involving older adults in the 68 studies . Including these motivations as context in prototyping and prototype use would also have provided a valuable perspective . Many of the studies in the primary data of this review did not go into sufficient detail to convey their intention with - and effects of prototyping and prototype use . In this review , we have at times relied on vague descriptions and interpreted the author’s choice 179 PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Harald Maartmann - Moe and Suhas Govind Joshi of words to infer how they understand prototyping and prototype use . Detailed descriptions of who participates , and the intentions and effects of prototyping and prototype use in design is necessary for understanding the design and research process , as the different ways we use prototypes within a PD project will likely yield very different processes for the stakeholders as well as unique outcomes from the process . Improving this understanding will also further discourse and practice of the use of prototypes and prototyping in PD with older adults . The limited reach and data size of this review impede general - izations to PD as a whole . Future work building on more parts of PD as a field would serve in understanding how we involve older adults in PD , and how we may advance the involvement . By examining prototyping and prototype use in PD with older adults we are better equipped to assess our current practice and research focus on the inclusion of older adults in PD . This , in turn , will serve in furthering the inclusion of older adults in design , their empowerment , and advance design practice and outcomes . This study urges reviews including geographical areas beyond Europe and US . Additionally , the older adults who participate in research are likely those with better access to technology and community gathering places such as Senior Centers . Efforts to include these people should also be a priority in future work . Prototyping and prototype application vary widely . The set of categories presented in Table 2 may serve as inspiration for other researchers and practitioners in prototyping and prototype use . Clearly describe the goal and effects of prototyping and proto - type activities . Prototyping and prototype use vary greatly within PD with older adults ( Table 2 ) . The intentions , effects , and manner of inclusion need to be clearly defined and described . We urge PD practitioners to explicitly answer three questions when describing the involvement of older adults in PD : 1 . Who is included in each prototyping and prototype activity ? 2 . How are they included in these activities ? 3 . Why are they involved ? These questions are fundamental in understanding the partici - pation and influence of participants in PD . Several studies inferred participation in prototyping activities but leave out the details in the involvement . A “prototype session” could refer to vastly different activites and involvement , such as a ) Researchers ask participants to comment their first impres - sions on two pre - made prototypes , and later consider their opinions . b ) Researchers create prototypes with participants , give them time to understand and define the design situation , under - stand design possibilities and bring in their own , choose what directions to pursue , co - construct , understand consequences for use , and design opportunities . The two scenarios A and B differ in terms of participation , and we believe answering the three questions presented above will aid in conveying the process and context sufficiently with attention to principles of interest in PD , the inclusion of older adults , and to further our understanding of prototyping and prototype use . These descriptions are essential to understanding the studies’ process and view of prototyping and prototypes in PD with older adults . The analysis in this review concludes that older adults are mostly involved in prototyping and prototype use by Evaluating and Refin - ing , more often than Decide , Teach , Explore , Generate which relate more to the central principles and goals in PD . We would be worried if the trend in PD was to mainly involve older adults through Eval - uation and Refining , as the participants would not be encouraged or given the opportunity to bring in new ideas and make design decisions . Fortunately , this review is not fit to comment on the overall current prevalence of prototyping and prototype use in all PD . Still , examining this trend may be a challenge to future research and PD . This review has raised several interesting questions that we intend to pursue in our future work . Do older adults want to be involved in prototyping and prototype use beyond Evaluation and Refine activities ? Do we want to see more involvement of older adults in proto - typing or prototype activities in PD ? How do we facilitate this involvement ? There are many ways to talk about age , and a salient perspective for PD might be the participants’ subjective view of how old they feel , rather than focusing on their chronological age . With this perspective , describing the specific context is vital to understand - ing who the “older adults” are . The social , economic , and political structures can influence how individuals or groups of people expe - rience aging , e . g . , as different social - economic statuses can create both barriers and gaps among similarly - aged people in terms of how they experience aging . Studies have previously also called for researchers to specifically seek diversity among the participants to reflect the heterogeneity among the broad range of people that can be recruited among those over 65 years ( Lindsay et al . , 2012 ) . However , context can be vital to how people ultimately experience aging ; rather than something static , the experience of aging may evolve along with how the user and technology interaction change over time within a given context . As Frennert & Östlund ( 2016 ) note , the specific technology people interact with affects their own per - ception of aging . Reviews that look deeper at the concrete context of the participants , as well as the researchers’ intentions in involv - ing older adults in PD would serve as a valuable complementing perspective to this review . 7 CONCLUSION This systematic literature review examined the role of the use of prototypes and prototyping in Participatory Design ( PD ) with older adults . We analyzed the selected studies and created ten descrip - tive forms of use of prototypes and prototyping to characterize prototyping and prototype use in PD with older adults : Refine , Evaluate , Motivate , Generate , Explore , Teach , Decide , Communicate , Understand , and Contribute . Our analysis further examines the prevalence of each category of forms of use , as well as who participate within these forms of activities . The analysis highlights a seemingly low utilization of prototyp - ing and prototype to Decide with participants , and the frequent use in Evaluation . The principal component analysis further highlighted three somewhat separate practices within the prototyping and proto - type use : 180 Prototyping and Prototype use in Participatory Design with older adults PDC 2022 Vol . 1 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom 1 . Generate , Explore , Teach , Motivate , and partly Understand and Communicate . 2 . Decide , Refine , Understand , Communicate , and the absence of both Teach and Contribute 3 . Evaluate , Refine , and the absence of Communicate These three clusters may be a natural grouping corresponding to three subtle types of study design , or they may reflect three different traditions or views on prototype and prototype use within PD . The third cluster has many similarities to UCD , and less so to PD . Yet , these forms of prototyping and prototype use are vital in PD as well . With the addition of these descriptive forms of prototyping and prototype use , prevalence , and their interrelations , we invite further discussion on the role of the use of prototypes and prototyping in PD , particularly in PD with older adults , as well as further exami - nation of the concrete context of involvement .
