Most proteins fulfill their tasks in complexes with other proteins , and analysis of protein – protein interactions ( PPIs ) can therefore provide insights into protein function . Several methods can be used to generate large - scale protein interaction networks . However , most of these approaches are not quantitative and therefore cannot reveal how perturbations affect the network . Here , we illustrate how a clever combination of quantitative mass spectrometry with different biochemical methods provides a rich toolkit to study different aspects of PPIs including topology , subunit stoichiometry , and dynamic behavior . Keywords : mass spectrometry based proteomics , quantitative proteomics , protein – protein interaction , stoichiometry , cross - linking Introduction Proteins do not act in isolation but typically mediate their biological functions by interacting with other proteins ( Charbonnier et al . , 2008 ) . Owing to the central importance of protein – protein interactions ( PPIs ) in biology , methods have been developed to study multiple aspects of PPIs ( Meyerkord and Fu , 2015 ) . For example , X - ray crystallography and NMR provide detailed spatial information about interaction interfaces . Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) , isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , and förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) provide binding affinities and kinetics . However , all of those methods require a priori knowledge of the interaction partners and suffer from the drawback of a low throughput . Technologies like protein microarrays , phage display and the yeast two - hybrid system permit high - throughput screens for PPIs . However , these approaches rely on in vitro assays or heterologous biological systems . Therefore , it is not clear if PPIs detected by these methods occur in the relevant in vivo context . Affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry ( AP - MS ) has emerged as a particularly attractive method for PPI mapping ( Gingras et al . , 2007 ) . A major advantage is that this method allows unbiased detection of PPIs under physiological conditions . Importantly , AP - MS can assess PPIs in relevant biological contexts such as mammalian cell lines or even tissues . Moreover , AP - MS experiments have the advantage that they can provide quantitative information ( q - AP - MS ) . This greatly increases the confidence in interaction partners that are identified and can also be used to study the impact of perturbations on PPIs . We argue that q - AP - MS is one of the most powerful technologies to map PPIs in health and disease . The aim of this Mini Review is to briefly explain the general principle of q - AP - MS and to emphasize the versatility of AP - MS to investigate various aspects of PPIs including quantities , Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org July 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 237 1 Meyer and Selbach Quantitative interaction proteomics topology , subunit stoichiometry , and dynamic behavior . We will begin with a brief introduction to quantitative shotgun proteomics . Quantitative Shotgun Proteomics The principle idea of shotgun proteomics is that protein samples are first digested into peptides ( Aebersold and Mann , 2003 ) . These peptides are then separated by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and directly ( “online” ) transferred into a mass spectrometer . This instrument performs two important tasks . First , it measures the mass to charge ratios ( m / z ) and intensity of the peptides eluting from the HPLC column ( MS 1 ) . Second , in order to determine the amino acid sequence , the instruments selects individual peptides for fragmentation and records the resulting fragment spectra ( MS 2 ) . Data generated in this manner is then compared to protein databases for peptide and protein identification ( Eng et al . , 2011 ) . Until a decade ago , the field of proteomics has used mass spectrometry mainly to draw qualitative conclusions about the existence of a protein in a given sample . The reason for this is that the intensities of peaks in a mass spectrum are not directly proportional to the amounts of the corresponding peptides . Hence , mass spectrometry is intrinsically not a quantitative technology ( Ong and Mann , 2005 ) . However , over the past several years various technologies have been developed to enable proteome - wide quantification using mass spectrometry ( Gstaiger and Aebersold , 2009 ; Cox and Mann , 2011 ; Bantscheff et al . , 2012 ) . One idea relies on the incorporation of stable heavy isotopes into proteins through metabolic ( SILAC ) or chemical labeling approaches . This permits different cell populations to be mixed and analyzed together , since the mass - shift introduced by the labeling makes them distinguishable . Relative changes in peptide intensities reflect differences in the abundance of the proteins under distinct experimental conditions . Alternatively , proteins can be quantified using computational methods ( “label - free quantification” ; Figure 1B ) . This may be based solely on how often peptides have been chosen for fragmentation ( spectral counting ) or on all intensities obtained from precursor peptide scans . Care should be taken when employing the first approach , since it provides only very rough abundance estimates ( Rinner et al . , 2007 ; Gingras and Raught , 2012 ) . While the choice of a quantification approach depends on various factors , stable isotope - based methods are generally more precise than label free approaches since samples can be combined and analyzed together ( Sury et al . , 2010 ; Lau et al . , 2014 ) . For example , while stable isotope - based methods can detect even minor changes in protein abundance , label free approaches typically require a twofold change or more ( Cox et al . , 2014 ) . Specificity and Sensitivity A major challenge in AP - MS is to distinguish true interaction partners from non - specific contaminants . An early idea to address this problem was tandem affinity purification ( TAP ; Puig et al . , 2001 ) . Here , the protein of interest is expressed as a fusion with two different biochemical tags . Two consecutive rounds of affinity purification are then employed in order to remove non - specific contaminants . Although this approach has been used successfully in many studies , it has two major disadvantages . First , only very stable complexes survive the procedure , which means that TAP cannot be used to study more dynamic interactions . Second , the sensitivity of modern mass spectrometers is so high that they still detect many non - specific binders after TAP . An alternative idea is to use a single purification step and to exclude non - specific contaminants based on prior knowledge . The “contaminant repository for affinity purification” ( CRAPome ) was built for this purpose and contains information about frequently observed unspecific binders ( Mellacheruvu et al . , 2013 ) . While this is generally a good idea , one important limitation is that the non - specific background depends on specific experimental conditions . In other words , not all proteins in the CRAPome are necessarily contaminants in a specific experiment , nor are all contaminants in a specific experiment contained in the CRAPome . Quantitative proteomics offers an attractive solution to address these challenges ( Figure 1A ) . In quantitative AP - MS ( q - AP - MS ) , the quantity of proteins that co - purify with the bait is compared to a negative control ( Vermeulen et al . , 2008 ; Paul et al . , 2011 ) . In this set - up , true interaction partners can be identified by their specific abundance ratio while non - specific contaminants bind equally well under both conditions , which results in a 1 : 1 ratio . Hence , q - AP - MS uses quantification to filter out non - specific contaminants . This greatly increases confidence in identified interaction partners , even under mild biochemical purification conditions . Perturbations One of the major advantages of q - AP - MS is that it can assess dynamic changes in PPIs upon perturbation ( Figure 1C ) . To this end , the proteins which co - purify with a bait protein under normal and perturbed conditions are compared in a quantitative manner . An early example of this general principle employed the immobilized SH2 - domain of the adapter protein Grb2 to study epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor signaling ( Blagoev et al . , 2003 ) . SH2 domains interact with specific tyrosine - phosphorylated motifs . Therefore , the immobilized domain was used in cells stimulated with EGF to pull down interacting proteins . Cells that had not been stimulated served as a negative control . Subsequently , a quantitative comparison of the two pull - down contexts revealed proteins recruited to Grb2 upon activation by EGF . After this pioneering work , the same idea was used to assess dynamic PPIs during cell signaling with different experimental designs . For example , immobilized peptides carrying specific posttranslational modifications and their unmodified counterparts were used to identify modification - dependent interactions ( Selbach et al . , 2009 ; Bartke et al . , 2010 ; Francavilla et al . , 2013 ) . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous or epitope - tagged proteins before and after stimulation has also been frequently employed ( Collins et al . , 2013 ; Zheng et al . , 2013 ; Sury et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , quantification can reveal differences in the interaction partners of wild - type Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org July 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 237 2 Meyer and Selbach Quantitative interaction proteomics FIGURE 1 | Approaches to q - AP - MS experiments . ( A ) The left hand side depicts the typical workflow of a SILAC - based q - AP - MS experiment . Differentially SILAC - labeled cells are transfected with a tagged protein of interest or a control vector containing only the tag , respectively . Proteins are immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the tag . Samples are mixed prior to elution . Eluted proteins are cleaved into peptides and analyzed by Liquid - Chromatography Mass Spectrometry ( LC - MS ) . ( B – G ) The right hand side depicts how q - AP - MS can be employed to study different aspects of PPIs . ( B ) Label - free quantification provides an alternative to SILAC . ( C ) Immunoprecipitation can compare changes in PPIs upon perturbation . ( D ) Transient interactions and complex structure can be studied by cross - linking . ( E ) Submodule composition and PPI dynamics can be revealed by sequential elution with increasing concentrations of SDS . ( F ) Limited proteolysis provides a means to detect interaction interfaces . ( G ) The stoichiometry of complexes can be revealed by comparing abundances of the different subunits . Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org July 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 237 3 Meyer and Selbach Quantitative interaction proteomics proteins and disease - associated variants ( Lambert et al . , 2013 ; Hosp et al . , 2015 ) . If those mutations map to a protein with unknown function , an AP - MS experiment can provide valuable insights based on the known functions of identified interaction partners . In vivo Interactions Many AP - MS studies make use of overexpressed and / or tagged proteins as baits . However , this may interfere with the normal in vivo function of the protein and thus lead to false - positive or false - negative results . Overexpression artifacts can be limited when tagged proteins are expressed at near - endogenous levels , for example using bacterial artificial chromosomes ( Hubner et al . , 2010 ) . However , it is still possible that the tag interferes with protein function . It has been shown recently that even cloning scars between the protein and the tag can lead to false - positive identifications ( Banks et al . , 2015 ) . This problem can be addressed by targeting the endogenous protein with specific antibodies . While this has been employed successfully ( Malovannaya et al . , 2011 ; Lundby et al . , 2014 ) , an important caveat is that antibody cross - reactivity may lead to false - positive results . In case of tagged proteins the specificity can be assessed using untransfected cells as negative controls , but this is not possible when the endogenous protein is targeted . To address this issue , many published studies have used control antibodies . However , due to differences in the cross - reactivity of various antibodies , this strategy is questionable . A better control is to knock down the protein of interest in the control condition , which makes it possible to use the same antibody for comparison ( Selbach and Mann , 2006 ) . Nevertheless , the lack of good antibodies is an important limitation and one of the reasons why epitope - tagged proteins still dominate such studies . Another important consideration is that the interaction partners identified in cell lines may not necessarily be relevant in vivo . More and more studies therefore purify proteins and their interaction partners directly from animal models ( Cheeseman et al . , 2004 ; Angrand et al . , 2006 ; Bartoi et al . , 2010 ; Rees et al . , 2011 ; Hanack et al . , 2015 ) . With the advent of genome editing techniques such as CRISPR it is now possible to generate genomic tag knock - ins in an efficient manner ( Sander and Joung , 2014 ) . This makes it much easier to create tagged versions of endogenous proteins for in vivo interactome mapping and tissue culture experiments . Most of the methods discussed here are generally applicable to any organism . Even the SILAC approach , which was originally developed for metabolic labeling of tissue culture cells , has since been extended to a number of model organisms ( Kirchner and Selbach , 2012 ) . Thus , we expect that in vivo interaction proteomics will become more widespread . Cross - linking Uponcelllysis , proteinsarebroughtintoanartificialenvironment . This can result in the loss of weak or transient interactions or the formation of in vitro interactions in the lysate . One way to address this problem is in vivo cross - linking ( Kaake et al . , 2014 ; Figure 1D ) . Newly formed covalent bonds between interacting proteins permit stringent purification conditions which minimize in vitro interactions and preserve transient interactions ( Tardiff et al . , 2007 ; Fang et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , the identification of cross - linked peptides can provide valuable information about the structure of proteins and complexes ( Rappsilber , 2011 ; Walzthoeni et al . , 2013 ) . Despite these advantages , most AP - MS experiments performed today do not employ cross - linking . One reason is that cross - linked peptides are typically less abundant and are thus more difficult to identify than regular peptides . To address this problem , several strategies that enrich for cross - linked peptides have been developed ( Rinner et al . , 2008 ; Nessen et al . , 2009 ) . Interaction Interfaces Cross - linking requires that target sites be accessible , which makes it difficult to apply this approach to interfaces buried within a protein complex . This limitation is actually used as an advantage in several other methods to provide information about interaction interfaces . For example , protein painting employs small molecular dyes which adhere to the accessible surfaces of protein complexes , excluding binding interfaces ( Luchini et al . , 2014 ) . During the subsequent digestion , only peptides within interaction interfaces are accessible to trypsin and can thus be identified . Limited proteolysis ( Feng et al . , 2014 ) is an approach that is complementary to protein painting , in that it reveals only peptides outside interaction interfaces that are accessible to trypsin ( Figure 1F ) . Another possibility is to treat samples with heavy ( i . e . , deuterated ) water : hydrogen - deuterium exchange ( HDX ; Mandell et al . , 2005 ) relies on the fact that amides hidden within protein – protein interfaces are not in direct contact with the solvent and will exchange their hydrogen atoms at a lower rate than more accessible amides . The corresponding changes in the peptide mass can then be detected using mass spectrometry . These techniques are not only useful in the study of PPIs but can additionally provide information about protein structure ( Chorev et al . , 2015 ) . Stoichiometry The approaches mentioned above typically rely on relative quantification . Thus , they can be used to distinguish specific interaction partners from contaminants and to quantify dynamic changes in PPIs upon perturbation . However , these methods can only compare the same protein under different conditions . They do not provide information about the stoichiometry of the distinct members of a complex . One way to compare different proteins in a complex is to measure their absolute abundances using synthetic isotope - labeled reference peptides as spike - in standards ( Schmidt et al . , 2010 ) . For a large number of proteins , this is tedious and expensive . The SH - quant approach therefore incorporates an additional reference peptide into the affinity tag that is used for the pull - down ( Wepf et al . , 2009 ) . This permits quantification of the bait and also of prey proteins , in the event they have been used as baits in another experiment . This “correlational quantification” allows the measurement of protein complex stoichiometry Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org July 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 237 4 Meyer and Selbach Quantitative interaction proteomics and absolute protein complex abundances . Alternatively , the stoichiometry of protein complexes can also be analyzed through a combination of affinity purification and intensity - based absolute quantification ( iBAQ ; Figure 1G ; Schwanhausser et al . , 2011 ; Smits et al . , 2013 ) . The latter approach has the advantage that it is easy to implement and does not require the tagging of multiple baits . It is also important to keep in mind that the same bait protein can be part of multiple protein complexes . Therefore , not all proteins that co - purify with a bait are necessarily members of the same complex . Distinguishing between these different complexes requires the individual pull - down of all components . Dynamic Interactions Not all of the specific interaction partners of a protein necessarily belong to a stable complex . Some interaction partners interact only transiently . The dynamic behavior of proteins can be investigated by mixing protein samples at different stages of an AP - MS experiment . Metabolic labeling approaches such as SILAC allow a mixing of samples directly after cells are harvested ( Ong et al . , 2002 ) . While this minimizes experimental differences in sample handling , it also results in the loss of dynamic interactions with high on / off rates : During incubation with antibodies , these dynamic interaction partners will be exchanged between both conditions and reach equilibrium over time . Alternatively , samples may first be mixed after affinity purification . When both protocols are performed in parallel on the same samples , the data can be used to identify the dynamic components in protein complexes ( Mousson et al . , 2008 ; Wang and Huang , 2008 ) . A related idea uses increasing concentrations of SDS to elute precipitated proteins sequentially ( Figure 1E ; Texier et al . , 2014 ) . These data can be used to dissect the submodular composition of complexes due to their different binding properties . Binding affinity is a particularly relevant quantity with regard to characterizing the interaction between two proteins . Typically , binding affinities are measured using methods such as ITC or SPR assays which require considerable quantities of purified proteins . q - AP - MS experiments can also be designed in a way to provide information about binding affinities ( Sharma et al . , 2009 ) : First , a known quantity of an immobilized bait is incubated with cell extracts to pull down interactors . Next , the supernatant from this experiment is used in a second pull - down with the same bait . The quantification of the proteins in both pull - downs can then be used to infer the dissociation constants of the interactions . While so far this technique has only been used to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants ( K d s ) of proteins interacting with small molecules and peptides , it should be generally applicable to a range of ligands , including entire proteins , used as baits . Conclusions The examples described above show that a combination of quantitative shotgun proteomics with various biochemical methods can provide a rich toolkit to explore various aspects of PPIs . This can be employed to ( i ) identify binding partners with high specificity , ( ii ) assess the stoichiometry of complexes , ( iii ) provide information about interaction interfaces , ( iv ) analyze binding affinities , and ( v ) study dynamic changes of PPIs upon perturbation . Bearing in mind possible pitfalls ( Duncan et al . , 2010 ) , mass spectrometers can thus be regarded as “Swiss army knives” for PPI research . Since instruments are becoming faster , more sensitive , easier to operate and cheaper , we expect these approaches to become available to more and more scientists .
