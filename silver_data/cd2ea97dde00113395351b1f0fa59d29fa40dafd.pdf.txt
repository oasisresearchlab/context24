One - sentence summary : SAC9 prevents the accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in intracellular compartments , thereby contributing to clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane and regulating the cortical localization of its protein partner SH3P2 . Keywords : Arabidopsis , endocytic trafficking , phosphoinositides , early endosome , plasma membrane ABSTRACT Membrane lipids , and especially phosphoinositides , are differentially enriched within the 1 eukaryotic endomembrane system . This generates a landmark code by modulating the 2 properties of each membrane . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] specifically 3 accumulates at the plasma membrane in yeast , animal and plant cells , where it regulates a 4 wide range of cellular processes including endocytic trafficking . However , the functional 5 consequences of mispatterning PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in plants are unknown . Here , we functionally 6 characterized the putative phosphoinositide phosphatase SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9 ( SAC9 ) 7 in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ) . We found that SAC9 depletion led to the ectopic 8 localization of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on cortical intracellular compartments , which depends on PI4P and 9 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production at the plasma membrane . SAC9 localizes to a subpopulation of trans - 10 Golgi Network / early endosomes that are enriched in a region close to the cell cortex and that 11 are coated with clathrin . Furthermore , it interacts and colocalizes with Src Homology 3 12 Domain Protein 2 ( SH3P2 ) , a protein involved in endocytic trafficking . In the absence of 13 SAC9 , SH3P2 localization is altered and the clathrin - mediated endocytosis rate is reduced . 14 Together , our results highlight the importance of restricting PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma 15 membrane and illustrate that one of the consequence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 misspatterning in plants is 16 to impact the endocytic trafficking . 17 18 INTRODUCTION 19 Phosphoinositides constitute a family of low abundance lipids differentially enriched in 20 the membranes of eukaryotic cells ( Platre and Jaillais 2016 ; Balla 2013 ; Noack and Jaillais 21 2020 ) . These versatile lipids can be interconverted into one another . For example , 22 Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] is synthetized from Phosphatidylinositol 4 - 23 phosphate ( PI4P ) by PI4P - 5 kinases , and is dephosphorylated into PI4P by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - 24 phosphatase ( Noack and Jaillais 2017 ) . Furthermore , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI4P are hydrolyzed by 25 phospholipases C ( PLC ) into diacylglycerol and soluble phosphorylated inositol ( Balla 2013 ) . 26 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 strictly localizes at the plasma membrane in plants and animal cells ( van Leeuwen 27 et al . 2007 ; Carim et al . 2019 ; Del Signore et al . 2017 ; Simon et al . 2014 ; Ben El Kadhi et al . 28 2011 ) despite the plasma membrane being constantly turned - over by endocytosis and 29 exocytosis . Throughout this paper , we define endocytosis in its broader sense , including the 30 internalization step sensus stricto ( i . e . , recruitment of cargo and coat components of the 31 “clathrin - mediated endocytosis” machinery , formation of clathrin - coated pits , scission of the 32 clathrin - coated vesicles and uncoating ) followed by the subsequent transport of lipid and 33 proteins through the endosomal system . As such , the endocytosis , or here after the endocytic 34 trafficking , is the process that allows 1 ) cells to transport particles and molecules across the 35 plasma membrane and 2 ) the termination of signaling through transport toward the vacuole 36 for degradation . At the plasma membrane , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interacts with a variety of extrinsic 37 membrane proteins such as endocytic protein adaptors ( Zhang et al . 2015 ) and actin - 38 regulatory proteins ( Paez Valencia et al . 2016 ) , which are recruited and / or activated by the 39 binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Therefore , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 subcellular patterning is likely critical to regulate 40 the recruitment of proteins that act at the plasma membrane , and the cellular processes they 41 mediate , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 42 Consistent with a critical role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the recruitment of early clathrin - mediated 43 endocytosis factors , a pip5k1 pip5k2 double mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ) 44 lacking two ubiquitously expressed PI4P - 5 kinases , has abnormal auxin distribution and 45 defective endocytic trafficking of the transmembrane auxin efflux carriers PIN - FORMED 1 46 ( PIN1 ) and PIN2 ( Tejos et al . 2014 ; Ischebeck et al . 2013 ; Mei et al . 2012 ) . Furthermore , the 47 pip5k1 pip5k2 double mutant has an altered dynamic of CLATRHIN LIGHT CHAIN2 48 ( CLC2 ) , with the density of CLC2 foci at the plasma membrane being reduced in the mutant 49 ( Ischebeck et al . 2013 ) . Overexpression of Arabidopsis PI4P - 5 kinase 6 in tip - growing 50 pollen tubes induced massive aggregation of the plasma membrane in pollen tube tips due to 51 excessive clathrin - dependent membrane invagination , supporting a role for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in 52 promoting early stages of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Zhao et al . 2010 ) . The inducible 53 overexpression of a highly active human PI4P - 5 kinase leads to an increase PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 54 production , very strong developmental phenotypes and heightened endocytic trafficking 55 toward the vacuole ( Gujas et al . 2017 ) . In addition , we recently showed that inducible 56 depletion of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from the plasma membrane using the iDePP system leads to a 57 decrease of the fraction of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 - µ and the Src Homology ( SH3 ) - 58 domain containing protein 2 ( SH3P2 ) at the plasma membrane ( Doumane et al . 2021 ) . 59 Furthermore , FM4 - 64 uptake experiments confirmed an impact of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion from 60 the plasma membrane on bulk endocytic flow . 61 In animal cells , several PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatases are required for the late stages of clathrin - 62 mediated endocytosis ( He et al . 2017 ; Pirruccello et al . 2014 ) . Many PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatases 63 belong to the 5 - Phosphatase enzyme family , including OCRL and synaptojanins ( Syn1 / 2 ) in 64 animals , and synaptojanin - like proteins ( Inp51p / Snjl1p , Inp52p / Sjl2p and Inp53p / Sjl3p ) in 65 Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding 5 - 66 phosphatases , but only a few are characterized . Mutation in the 5 - phosphatase 9 leads to 67 osmotic stress tolerance , with reduced reactive oxygen species production and Ca 2 + influx 68 ( Golani et al . 2013 ) . The 5 - phosphatase 6 / COTYLEDON VASCULAR PATTERN2 ( CVP2 ) 69 and 5 - phosphatase 7 / CVP2 LIKE 1 ( CVL1 ) are specifically required for vascular 70 differentiation ( Rodriguez - Villalon et al . 2015 ; Carland and Nelson 2009 ; Carland and 71 Nelson 2004 ) . Finally , the 5 - phosphatase 15 / FRAGILE FIBER 3 ( FRA3 ) is expressed in 72 developing fibers and vascular cells , which is consistent with the defective fiber and vessel 73 phenotypes seen in the loss - of - function fra3 mutant ( Zhong et al . 2004 ) . 74 Proteins containing SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN ( or Sac1 - like ) domains constitute another 75 family of phosphoinositide phosphatases ( Zhong and Ye 2003 ) . In Arabidopsis , there are nine 76 SAC proteins , forming three clades ( Zhong and Ye 2003 ) . The first clade is composed of 77 SAC1 , a PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase ( Zhong et al . 2005 ) , and its relatives SAC2 to 5 , putative 78 PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatases ( Novakova et al . 2014 ) . The second clade corresponds to 79 SAC7 / RHD4 a PI4P 4 - phosphatase ( Thole et al . 2008 ) and its relatives SAC6 and SAC8 80 putative PI4P 4 - phosphatases ( Song et al . 2021 ) . The third clade is composed of a single 81 member , a plant - specific protein called SAC9 . SAC9 has a unique structure , with a SAC 82 phosphoinositide phosphatase domain at its N - terminus , immediately followed by a putative 83 protein / protein interaction domain ( WW domain ) , and a long C - terminal region of 1104 84 amino acids where a putative coil - coiled domain is predicted ( Figure 1A , ( Zhong and Ye 85 2003 ) . The sac9 mutant is dwarf , it constitutively accumulates anthocyanins and it expresses 86 genes from stress response pathways ( Williams et al . 2005 ) . Loss - of - function alleles of SAC9 87 display a three - fold increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 content , together with a decrease of PI4P level , 88 suggesting that it acts as a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase in planta ( Williams et al . 2005 ) . 89 Using in vivo confocal microscopy , we found that SAC9 localizes in a subpopulation of 90 trans - Golgi network / early endosomes ( TGN / EEs ) enriched in a region close to the cell 91 cortex . Loss of SAC9 results into PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mis - patterning at the subcellular level , leading to 92 the accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in subcortical compartments associated with TGN / EEs . Similar 93 cellular and developmental phenotypes were observed when SAC9 was mutated on its 94 putative catalytic cysteine , suggesting that the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of 95 SAC9 is required for function . SAC9 interacts and colocalizes with the endocytic component 96 SH3P2 . In the absence of SAC9 , and therefore when the patterning of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is 97 compromised , SH3P2 localization is affected and the clathrin - mediated endocytosis is 98 significantly reduced . Thus , SAC9 is required to maintain efficient endocytic uptake , 99 highlighting the importance of restricting the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pool to the plasma membrane . 100 101 RESULTS 102 The cysteine 459 in the catalytic domain of SAC9 is required for SAC9 function 103 We investigated the root phenotype in the already described mutant alleles of SAC9 104 ( Vollmer et al . 2011 ; Williams et al . 2005 ) . As previously described , sac9 - 1 - / - and sac9 - 3 - / - 105 knock - out mutants are two times shorter compared to the Wild - type ( WT ) Col - 0 , at 12 days 106 post - germination ( dpg ; Figure 1A to 1C ) . We also observed a three - time decrease in the 107 lateral root density of sac9 - 1 - / - and sac9 - 3 - / - compared to WT plants ( Figure 1B to 1D ) . To 108 confirm that the phenotypes observed were due to the loss - of - function of SAC9 , we 109 generated Arabidopsis lines expressing SAC9 fused to a fluorescent protein ( mCIT - SAC9 110 and TdTOM - SAC9 ) under SAC9 native promoter ( SAC9pro ) or the UBIQUITIN10 promoter 111 ( UBQ10pro ) , respectively ( Figure 1 , Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A , 1B ) . We found that both 112 SAC9pro : mCIT - SAC9 and UBQ10pro : TdTOM - SAC9 rescued sac9 - 3 - / - mutant phenotypes in 113 two independent homozygous T3 transgenic lines for each construct ( Figure 1B , 1C ; Figure 114 1 - supplemental Figure 1A ) . These results indicate that the root phenotypes described above 115 are caused by SAC9 loss - of - function , and that N - terminally tagged SAC9 proteins are 116 functional . 117 Next , we mutated the cysteine in the conserved C - x ( 5 ) - R - [ T / S ] catalytic motif found in all 118 SAC domain - containing phosphoinositide phosphatase ( Hsu and Mao , 2015 , 2013 ; Figure 1A 119 and Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A ) . Such cysteine - to - alanine substitution were shown to 120 block the catalytic phosphatase activity of other SAC domain - containing proteins ( Manford 121 et al . 2010 ; Tani and Kuge 2014 ) , and thus mCIT - SAC9 C459A is a putative catalytically dead 122 version of the enzyme . By contrast to wild - type mCIT - SAC9 , we could not find any 123 transgenic lines expressing SAC9pro : mCIT - SAC9 C459A that were able to rescue the sac9 - 3 124 phenotype , out of 24 independent lines analyzed in T1 ( Figure 1B , 1C , Figure 1 - 125 Supplemental Figure 1A , 1B ) . Further analyses on two independent T3 homozygous lines 126 confirmed these initial results and showed that mCIT - SAC9 C459A fusions were stable and 127 accumulated to similar extent as wild - type mCIT - SAC9 ( Figure 1B , 1C , Figure 1 - 128 Supplemental Figure 1A , 1B ) . Thus , the putative catalytic cysteine , C459 , is required for 129 SAC9 function but not for the stability of the protein , suggesting that the phosphatase activity 130 of SAC9 is participating in the observed phenotypes . 131 132 SAC9 localizes to a population of early endosomes close to the plasma membrane 133 Some phosphoinositide - phosphatases such as Metazoan Sac1 and yeast Sac1p , are able to 134 dephosphorylate in vitro several phosphoinositide species , but display a narrower specificity 135 in vivo ( Hughes et al . 2000 ; Guo et al . 1999 ; Rivas et al . 1999 ) . Also , some enzymes involved 136 in phosphoinositide metabolism , such as the yeast PI 4 - kinases Stt4p and Pik1p , specifically 137 impact distinct pools of a given phosphoinositide species depending on their subcellular 138 localization ( Roy and Levine 2004 ; Yoshida et al . 1994 ; Flanagan et al . 1993 ) . Using 139 homozygous T3 transgenic lines expressing the functional SAC9pro : mCIT - SAC9 or 140 Ub10pro : TdTOM - SAC9 constructs , we assessed the subcellular distribution of SAC9 in 141 rescued sac9 - 3 - / - homozygous plants using live - cell fluorescence imaging . In meristematic 142 epidermal cells of Arabidopsis roots , mCIT - SAC9 and TdTOM - SAC9 were mainly diffused 143 in the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus ( Figure 2A to 2C , Figure 2 - figure supplement 144 1A ) . At the cortex of the cell , in close vicinity to the plasma membrane ( Zi focal plane , 145 Figure 2A ; Figure 2 - Supplemental Figure 1B ) , mCIT - SAC9 localized to a cortical population 146 of mobile dotty structures ( Figure 2B , Video 1 ) . To assess whether this discrete subcellular 147 localization was relevant for SAC9 function , we generated transgenic lines expressing a 148 mCIT - SAC9 variant in which the predicted coil - coiled motif was deleted , under the native 149 promoter ( Figure 1A , SAC9pro : mCIT - SAC9 ∆ CC ) . Analyses of 24 independent T1 revealed 150 that mCIT - SAC9 ∆ CC did not complement sac9 - 3 - / - dwarf phenotype ( Figure 1 - figure 151 supplement 1A ) . Similar to mCIT - SAC9 C459A , these results were confirmed on two 152 independents homozygous T3 lines and western blot analyses showed that mCIT - SAC9 ∆ CC 153 accumulated to similar extent as the wild - type mCit - SAC9 in each of these lines ( Figure 1 - 154 figure supplement 1B ) . However , mCIT - SAC9 ∆ CC did not localize to endosome and remained 155 entirely cytosolic ( Figure 2B , Figure 2 - Supplemental Figure 1C ) . Thus , even though SAC9 156 localization in cortical intracellular compartments is discreet , and only slightly enriched 157 compared to its cytosolic localization , it appears critical for function . Furthermore , this 158 analysis excludes a scenario in which the mCit - SAC9 - containing compartments are cytosolic 159 densities , because they are not seen with a cytosolic mutant of SAC9 . 160 The putative catalytically dead version , mCIT - SAC9 C459A , accumulated to a lesser extent 161 in the cytosol compared to the native form . In addition , SAC9 C459A showed a three - fold 162 increase in the number of labeled dotty structures compared with the signal collected for the 163 wild - type fusion proteins mCIT - SAC9 and TdTOM - SAC9 ( Figure 2C to 2D ) . This result 164 suggests that the putative catalytic cysteine of SAC9 is required for the dynamic interaction 165 of SAC9 with intracellular membranes . However , co - visualization of TdTOM - SAC9 and 166 mCIT - SAC9 C459A ( Figure 2E ) in Col - 0 background demonstrated that all TdTOM - SAC9 167 dotty structures colocalized with mCIT - SAC9 C459A at the cortex of the cell . 168 By comparing the signal observed at the cortex of the cell ( Zi ) with the signal collected at 169 the center of the cell ( Zii ) , we observed and quantified that mCIT - SAC9 labelled more 170 intracellular compartments close to the plasma membrane than at a distal position , while this 171 bias was less pronounced for FM4 - 64 labelled compartments ( Figure 2F to 2H ) . Similarly , 172 when imaging cells in their cortical part close to the plasma membrane ( Zi ) , the mCIT - SAC9 173 and mCIT - SAC9 C459A signal was concentrated in intracellular compartments at the close 174 vicinity with the plasma membrane ( Figure 2F , 2I ) . These results suggest a function for 175 SAC9 in regulating phosphoinositide homeostasis either at or in the close vicinity of the 176 plasma membrane . 177 We next investigated the nature of the intracellular structures labeled by mCIT - SAC9 . 178 Both mCIT - SAC9 and mCIT - SAC9 C459A colocalized with the amphiphilic styryl dye ( FM4 - 179 64 ) stained endosomal compartments at the cell’s cortex , just beneath the plasma membrane , 180 while the soluble mCIT - SAC9 ∆ CC did not ( Figure 3A and 3B , Figure 2 - Supplemental Figure 181 1B , 1C ; Figure 3 - Supplemental Figure 1A ) . Early endosomes / TGN ( EE / TGN ) are sensitive 182 to BFA while late endosomes ( LE / MVB ) are not ( Takagi and Uemura 2018 ) . We observed 183 that Brefeldin A ( BFA ) treatment led to the aggregation of mCIT - SAC9 and mCIT - 184 SAC9 C459A into BFA bodies ( Figure 3C and 3D ) . suggesting that both functional and C459 - 185 mutated SAC9 fusion proteins may localize to EE / TGN compartments . 186 To get more precise insights into the SAC9’s localization at the TGN , we crossed 187 Arabidopsis lines expressing fluorescent tagged SAC9 and SAC9 C459A proteins with 188 endomembranes markers ( Geldner et al . 2009 ) . Using live - cell imaging in root meristematic 189 cells at a Zi focal plane , we observed and quantified that mCIT - SAC9 colocalized with TGN 190 markers ( CLC2 - RFP > 79 % colocalization ; mCH - RabA1g > 91 % , mCH - VTI12 > 67 % ; Figure 191 3E and 3F ) . The mCIT - SAC9 showed very weak colocalization with a late endosome 192 ( LE / MVB ) marker ( mCH - RabF2a < 17 % , Figure 3E and 2F ) , and with a Golgi marker ( mCH - 193 Got1p < 1 % , Figure 3E and 3F ) . Similarly , mCIT - SAC9 C459A strongly colocalized with 194 CLC2 - RFP and mCH - RAB - A1g markers , whereas it did not colocalized with the Golgi 195 marker ( Figure 3 - supplemental Figure C , 3G and 3H ) . This confirmed that SAC9 and 196 SAC9 C459A fusion proteins localized to the TGN / EE , with the noticeable difference that SAC9 197 localization in endomembrane compartments was restricted to the cortex of the cell , 198 suggesting a role of SAC9 in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis between the plasma membrane and early 199 endosomal compartments . 200 201 SAC9 is required to maintain the pool of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane 202 It was previously reported that Arabidopsis sac9 - 1 loss - of - function mutant had a 203 diminution of PI4P and a three - fold accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , suggesting that SAC9 has a 204 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase catalytic activity ( Williams et al . 2005 ) . In order to visualize the 205 effect of the perturbation of the phosphoinositide metabolism in the absence of SAC9 , we 206 introgressed two independent PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensors ( Simon et al . 2014 ) into sac9 - 3 - / - genetic 207 background . As previously described , both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensors labeled the plasma 208 membrane and were excluded form intracellular compartments in wild - type cells ( Figure 4A 209 and 4B ) . In sac9 - 3 - / - , mCIT - 2xPH PLC and mCIT - TUBBYc not only labeled the plasma 210 membrane , but also decorated cortical intracellular dotty structures ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . In 211 addition to the absence of complementation observed macroscopically for sac9 - 3 mutants 212 expressing the putative catalytically - dead SAC9 C459A variant ( Figure 1B and 1C , Figure 1 - 213 figure supplement 1A ) , the same aberrant localization for the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor mCIT - 214 TUBBYc was observed in these lines ( Figure 4C ) . These results demonstrate that C459 is 215 required for the regulation of the pool of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and point out toward a role of SAC9 for 216 the restriction of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane via its catalytic phosphatase activity . 217 We also observed an increase in the number of intracellular compartments labeled by the 218 PI4P biosensors ( Simon et al . 2014 ; Simon et al . 2016 ) mCIT - PH FAPP1 and mCIT - P4M SidM , 219 but not for mCIT - PH OSBP ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . This result is consistent with a diminution of 220 the PI4P pool at the plasma membrane and therefore the relocalization of the PI4P biosensor 221 in intracellular compartments , as previously reported ( Simon et al . 2016 ) . The subcellular 222 localization of PI3P sensors ( mCIT - FYVE HRS and mCIT - PHOX p40 ) was identical between 223 Col - 0 and sac9 - / - cells ( Figure 4B , Supplemental Figure 2A ) . We detected a slight but 224 significant decrease in the density of intracellular compartments decorated by mCIT - C2 Lact 225 phosphatidylserine biosensor in sac9 - 3 - / - ( Figure 4B ; Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 ) . Taken 226 together , these results indicate that SAC9 - depletion leads to a massive change in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 227 subcellular patterning , which is present on intracellular cortical structures instead of only 228 being present at the plasma membrane . 229 Previous ultrastructural investigation using electron microscopy , reported a massive 230 accumulation of vesicles , presumably containing cell wall , at the close vicinity to the plasma 231 membrane in the sac9 mutant ( Vollmer et al . 2011 ) . When co - imaging 2xmCH - 2xPH FAPP1 232 together with mCIT - TUBBYc in sac9 - 3 - / - ( Figure 4D ) , the dotty structures decorated by the 233 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor were observed at the cortex of the cell ( Zi ) , in the close vicinity of the 234 plasma membrane ( Figure 4D upper panel ) , whereas those structures were rarely observed in 235 the internal part of the cell ( Figure 4D lower panel ) . Moreover , dotty structures containing 236 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were associated with PI4P - labelled compartments but they did not strictly overlap . 237 Confocal imaging of sac9 - 3 - / - mutant co - expressing mCIT - TUBBYc with endosomal markers 238 revealed that the dotty structures containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were found associated but strictly 239 overlapping with the FM4 - 64 endocytic tracer as well as TGN markers ( Figure 4 - figure 240 supplement 1C ) . Furthermore , BFA treatment efficiently induced 2xmCH - 2xPH FAPP1 - positive 241 BFA bodies in sac9 - 3 - / - but did not affect the distribution of mCIT - TUBBYc compartments in 242 the same cells ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 1D ) . Therefore , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing intracellular 243 compartments in sac9 - 3 - / - are devoid of any ARF GTPase activated by BFA sensitive ARF - 244 GEF , and are associated with TGN markers ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 1E ) . In vivo time - 245 lapse imaging of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor mCIT - TUBBYc and mCIT - 2xPH PLC in sac9 - 3 - / - mutant 246 revealed that those intracellular structures were mobile in the cortex of root epidermal cells , 247 hence , behaving like intracellular compartments ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 1F , Video 2 ) . 248 Moreover , in sac9 - 3 - / - coexpressing the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor mCIT - TUBBYc together with the 249 non - functional SAC9pro : tdTOM - SAC9 C459A , mCIT - TUBBYc - labelled intracellular structures 250 did not strictly colocalized but were observed at the same Z plan in close association with 251 tdTOM - SAC9 C459A ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 1G ) . 252 We next addressed the turnover and the origin of the cortical intracellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 253 compartment observed in sac9 - 3 - / - . We previously showed that short - term treatment ( 15 - 30 254 min ) with phenyl arsine oxide ( PAO ) , a pan PI 4 - kinases inhibitor , significantly depletes 255 PI4P ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 2 ) but not PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pools at the plasma membrane of plant 256 cells , whereas longer treatment ( > 60 min ) affects the synthesis of both lipids ( Figure 4 - figure 257 supplement 2A , Platre et al . , 2018 ; Simon et al . , 2016 ) . We used this pharmacological 258 approach to test the effect of the inhibition of either PI4P , or both PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 259 synthesis , on sac9 - 3 - / - anomalous PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 intracellular compartments ( Figure 4 - figure 260 supplement 2A to 2E ) . Solubilization of mCIT - PH FAPP1 - E50A PI4P biosensor in sac9 - 3 - / - cells 261 treated for either 30 or 120 min with PAO confirmed the efficient PI4P depletion in both 262 conditions ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 2A to 2E ) . Solubilization of mCIT - TUBBYc 263 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor in WT after 120 min of PAO exposure , but not after 30 min , confirmed 264 that an efficient PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion occurred only for the longest treatment ( Figure 4 - figure 265 supplement 2A to 2E ) . 30 min PAO treatment did not affect anomalous sac9 - 3 - / - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 266 compartments , but 120 min PAO treatment significantly reduced the number of anomalous 267 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 compartments compared to both 120 min mock treatments or 30 min short 268 treatment ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 2A to 2E ) , showing that intracellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 269 compartments in sac9 - 3 - / - are dependent on the PI4P synthesis , itself substrate for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 270 production . 271 272 SAC9 is required for efficient endocytic trafficking 273 Because of the specific localization of SAC9 at the cortex of the cell and its colocalization 274 with TGN / EE markers , we wondered whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 defective patterning in sac9 - 3 - / - 275 correlates with endocytic defects . We counted the numbers of labeled endosomes following 276 FM4 - 64 endocytic tracer treatment in cells from WT and sac9 - 3 - / - seedlings ( Rigal et al . 277 2015 ) . We observed a significant near two - fold decrease in the number of FM4 - 64 - labelled 278 endosomes per cells in sac9 - 3 - / - compared to the WT ( Figure 5A and 5B , Figure 5 - figure 279 supplement 1A ) , that was not caused by smaller cells in sac9 - 3 - / - as the density of FM4 - 64 - 280 labelled endosomes was also strongly and significantly decreased compared to the WT 281 ( Figure 5 - figure supplement 1 ) . We inhibited recycling with BFA , and used FM4 - 64 tracer to 282 monitor the endocytic trafficking by measuring the number of BFA bodies labeled by FM4 - 283 64 in Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - . We observed significantly less FM4 - 64 - labelled BFA bodies per 284 cells in sac9 - 3 - / - compared to the WT ( Figure 5C and 5D , Figure 5 - figure supplement 1B ) , 285 confirming the lower rate of endocytic trafficking in this mutant . We then assessed whether 286 SAC9 depletion affected the trafficking of cargo proteins . We , therefore , performed another 287 BFA assay , but using the integral membrane protein PIN - FORMED2 fused with GFP ( PIN2 - 288 GFP ) which localizes at the plasma membrane and in intracellular organelles as it 289 continuously recycles ( Armengot et al . 2016 ) . We observed significantly less PIN2 - GFP - 290 labelled BFA bodies per cell in sac9 - 3 - / - compared to WT ( Figure 5E and F ) . PIN2 - GFP being 291 partially located on intracellular organelles before BFA treatment , the effect observed may , 292 therefore , indicate an endocytic defect as supported by the others experiments , and / or a more 293 general defect in trafficking in sac9 - 3 - / - . 294 To gain further insights into the function of SAC9 in the endocytic trafficking , we 295 investigated the sensitivity of the sac9 mutant to pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis . 296 To this end , we used the recently described ES9 - 17 , which is a specific inhibitor of clathrin - 297 mediated endocytosis ( Dejonghe et al . 2019 ) . We treated wild - type and sac9 - 3 - / - seedlings 298 with ES9 - 17 for 180 min and labeled the plasma membrane and endosomes with FM4 - 64 . 299 We observed dome - shaped plasma membrane invaginations in ES9 - 17 long - term treatment of 300 Col - 0 seedlings , almost exclusively in elongating or differentiated cells ( epidermal or root 301 cap cells ) , substantiating the possibility that these invaginations constitute read - outs of long 302 term disturb endocytic trafficking ( Figure 5G and 5H , Doumane et al . , 2021 ) . Strikingly , we 303 observed a much higher number of dome - shaped plasma membrane invagination decorated 304 by the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensors mCIT - TUBBYc in cells from ES9 - 17 treated sac9 - 3 - / - ( Figure 305 5I ) , showing that SAC9 depletion causes over - sensitivity to inhibition of endocytic 306 trafficking . Hypersensitivity to endocytic trafficking inhibition , decreased internalization of 307 the bulk endocytic tracer FM4 - 64 and defects in PIN2 protein trafficking together indicate 308 that endocytic trafficking is impacted in the absence of SAC9 . 309 310 SAC9 is required for SH3P2 localization at the plasma membrane . 311 To gain some insights into SAC9 function , we next screened for SAC9 interactors using a 312 yeast two hybrid assay against a universal Arabidopsis normalized dT library ( ULTImate 313 Y2H SCREEN , hybrigenics ) . As a bait , we used a portion of SAC9 ( AA 499 to 966 ) , which 314 includes the WW domain , a putative protein - protein interaction platform ( Figure 6A ) . Out of 315 59 . 6 million screened interaction , we recovered and sequenced 260 independent clones 316 corresponding to 107 different proteins . However , among these proteins , most were classified 317 as proven artifact or low confidence interaction and only three candidates ( 2 . 8 % ) were 318 ranked as very high confidence in the interaction ( Supplementary File 1B ) . Among the high 319 confident interaction candidate , we identified 11 clones corresponding to SH3P2 ( 5 320 independent clones ) . In the yeast - two - hybrid screen , the selected interaction domain 321 identified for SH3P2 , corresponds to the C - terminal part of the proteins ( aa 213 - 368 ) , which 322 includes the SH3 domain ( Figure 6A ) . We decided to focus on this candidate because , like 323 SAC9 , SH3P2 is linked to both clathrin - mediated endocytosis and membrane 324 phosphoinositides . Indeed , SH3P2 i ) colocalizes with clathrin light chain , ii ) cofractionates 325 with clathrin - coated vesicles ( Nagel et al . 2017 ) , and iii ) co - immunoprecipitates in planta 326 with clathrin heavy chain ( Nagel et al . 2017 ) , clathrin light chain ( Adamowski et al . 2018 ) 327 and the dynamin DRP1A ( Ahn et al . 2017 ) . Furthermore , SH3P2 binds to various 328 phosphoinositides in vitro ( Zhuang et al . 2013 ; Ahn et al . 2017 ) , and its plasma membrane 329 localization is dependent on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vivo ( Doumane et al . , 2021 ) . 330 331 In an attempt to validate the reverse interaction , SH3P2 - GFP was transiently expressed in 332 N . benthamiana , then immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis ( IP - MS ) 333 was done . Among the top interactors were two SAC9 protein isoforms in N . benthamiana , as 334 determined by log fold - change and p - value in peptide count when compared to GFP control 335 ( Fig . 6B - C ) . As SH3P2 was previously shown to be degraded via the proteasome ( Leong 336 2022 ) , Bortezomib ( BTZ ) treatment was used to inhibit SH3P2 degradation in planta , and 337 we observed a corresponding increase in the log fold change and p - value of SAC9 peptide 338 counts compared to control ( GFP / BTZ ) . Notably , AUXILIN - LIKE1 / 2 which are already 339 described protein partners of SH3P2 ( Adamowski et al . 2018 ) , were found as among the top 340 hits in both conditions , either with or without BTZ , thereby validating the approach ( Fig . 6B - 341 C ) . 342 343 Using live cell imaging we observed and quantified that fluorescently tagged SAC9 and 344 SAC9 C459A colocalized with SH3P2 in a subcortical population of endomembrane 345 compartments ( Figure 6B , 6C ) , probably TGN / EEs ( Figure 3E and 3F ) . Because SH3P2 was 346 described to play a role in different steps of membrane trafficking , from the endocytosis at 347 the plasma membrane to autophagy , we next addressed more precisely which pool of SH3P2 348 was affected in the absence of SAC9 . Using confocal imaging , we observed a diminution of 349 the signal corresponding to SH3P2 - sGFP at the plasma membrane compared to the cytoplasm 350 in sac9 - 3 , while the amount of SH3P2 - sGFP detected via Western blot was similar between 351 the two genotypes ( Figure 6D to 6F , Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ) . Moreover , in the 352 absence of functional SAC9 , SH3P2 - TdTOM accumulates in structure closely associated with 353 the aberrant PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pool decorated with mCIT - TUBBYc ( Figure 6H ) . Altogether , the 354 trafficking defects observed in the sac9 mutant , the impaired localization of SH3P2 in the 355 absence of a functional SAC9 and the formation of a SAC9 - SH3P2 complex all point toward 356 a role of SAC9 in endocytic trafficking . 357 358 The endocytic protein T - PLATE has an altered dynamic in the absence of SAC9 359 SAC9 is observed at the close vicinity to the plasma membrane and its absence causes a 360 mislocalization of its protein partner SH3P2 , as well as a reduction of the overall endocytosis 361 process . We then assessed if the clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane was 362 affected in the absence of SAC9 . Using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) 363 microscopy , we determined the density and dynamic behavior of the endocytic protein from 364 the T - PLATE complex , T - PLATE - GFP , in the sac9 mutant compared with wild - type plants . 365 Quantitative analysis revealed that the density of T - PLATE - GFP was reduced in sac9 - 3 - / - 366 compared with the WT while the amount of TPLATE - GFP detected via western blot was 367 similar between the two genotypes ( Figure 7A , 7B ; Figure 6 - figure supplement 1 ; video 3 ) . 368 Analysis of the dynamics of T - PLATE - GFP at the plasma membrane of etiolated hypocotyl 369 revealed a decrease of the dwell time of T - PLATE - GFP at the plasma membrane in the sac9 370 mutant compared to the WT ( Figure 7C , 7D ) . This result is in line with a reduction of the 371 endocytic flow in the absence of SAC9 , and suggests that maintaining a strict plasma 372 membrane accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is critical for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 373 374 DISCUSSION 375 Here , we showed that SAC9 putative catalytic cysteine is required to complement the sac9 376 phenotype , suggesting that SAC9 phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is key for its 377 function . Fluorescent SAC9 protein fusions colocalize with TGN / EE markers in a 378 subpopulation of endosomes close to the plasma membrane . We found that the subcellular 379 patterning of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is defective in sac9 mutants , consistent with the idea that SAC9 is a 380 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase . In planta , SAC9 interacts and colocalizes with the endocytic 381 trafficking component SH3P2 . In the absence of SAC9 , and therefore when the patterning of 382 the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane and at its close vicinity is affected , SH3P2 localization 383 at the plasma membrane is decreased and the rate of clathrin - mediated endocytosis is 384 significantly reduced . Together , these findings underlie the importance of strictly restricting 385 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the plasma membrane during the endocytic process . 386 387 SAC9 and phosphoinositide interconversion along the endocytic pathway 388 In animal cells , a phosphoinositide conversion cascade has been described through the 389 successive action of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases . This cascade starts with 390 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane and ends - up with PI3P in the membrane of early 391 endosomes ( Noack and Jaillais 2017 ; Schmid and Mettlen 2013 ; Abad et al . 2017 ; Posor et 392 al . 2015 ; Posor et al . 2013 ; Shin et al . 2005 ) . Briefly , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is dephosphorylated at the 393 plasma membrane or during the endocytic process by 5 - phosphatase enzymes such as OCRL 394 and synaptojanin ( De Matteis et al . 2017 ) ( Cauvin et al . 2016 ; Nandez et al . 2014 ; Ben El 395 Kadhi et al . 2011 ; Posor et al . 2013 ) . PI4P is then phosphorylated into PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 inside 396 clathrin - coated pits by a PI3 - Kinase ( PI3K C2 α ) , before being converted into PI3P through 397 the action of a PI4P phosphatase on clathrin - coated vesicles ( Schmid and Mettlen 2013 ; 398 Posor et al . 2013 ) . Because both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI3P are essential regulators of endocytic 399 trafficking , this conversion cascade , and in particular the precise recruitment of dedicated 400 enzymes at the right place and at the right time during endocytic trafficking , is of critical 401 importance for clathrin - mediated endocytosis to proceed normally ( Noack and Jaillais 2017 ; 402 Schmid and Mettlen 2013 ) . 403 The plants TGN collects endocytic vesicles and redirects cargo proteins either to the 404 plasma membrane for recycling or to late endosomes / vacuole for degradation ( Dettmer et al . 405 2006 ; Narasimhan et al . 2020 ; Rodriguez - Furlan et al . 2019 ) . The plant TGN / EE is enriched 406 in PI4P , not PI3P , which instead accumulates in late endosomes ( Noack and Jaillais 2020 ; 407 Simon et al . 2014 ) . Interestingly , we found that i ) SAC9 localizes to clathrin - coated 408 compartments close to the plasma membrane , and ii ) the sac9 mutant accumulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 409 in vesicular structures at the cortex of the cells . Together , we propose that SAC9 represent 410 the long sought - after enzyme which performs the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - to - PI4P conversion during the 411 plant endocytic process ( Figure 8 ) . As such , SAC9 is required to erase PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in 412 endosomal membranes and thereby maintains this lipid strictly at the plasma membrane . 413 SAC9 being a putative PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatase , we could have expected that SAC9 414 overexpression may have induced gain - of - function phenotypes caused by ectopic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 415 dephosphorylation . However , transgenic lines that express SAC9 under the expression of the 416 UBQ10 promoter did not show any obvious phenotypes , and instead complemented the sac9 417 loss - of - function phenotype like the endogenous promoter . This absence of overexpression 418 phenotypes may be explained by several hypotheses . First , it is possible that SAC9 is not 419 sufficiently overexpressed when under the controlled of the UBQ10 promoter compared to 420 the endogenous SAC9 promoter . Second , it is possible that SAC9 overexpressing lines 421 compensate for the excess SAC9 activity by adjusting their PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 balance . 422 However , our data point toward a third possibility . Most lipid phosphatase studied to date 423 require membrane association to dephosphorylate their cognate phosphoinositide , while they 424 do not act on their target lipid when they are in the cytosol . We found that SAC9 strongly 425 accumulates in the cytoplasm when it is expressed under the control of either promoter and in 426 particular when it is overexpressed . Thus , SAC9 membrane association , rather than its 427 expression level , is likely to be the limiting factor preventing SAC9 gain - of - function 428 phenotype in over - expression lines . 429 430 Accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles in the sac9 mutant 431 In the absence of SAC9 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulates inside the cell in what appears to be abnormal 432 compartments that are associated with but independent from TGN / EEs . We can speculate that 433 the prolonged accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on clathrin - coated compartments , and perhaps the 434 lack of PI4P production on these structures , impairs the function of these vesicles . We also 435 observed that PI4P biosensors accumulates in TGNs in the sac9 mutants . We previously 436 found that PI4P biosensors relocalize to PI4P - containing TGNs upon specific depletion of 437 PI4P at the plasma membrane ( Simon et al . , 2016 , Platre et al . , 2018 ) . PI4P being the putative 438 product of SAC9 ( Williams et al . , 2009 ) , it is possible that there is a reduced amount of PI4P 439 at the plasma membrane in this mutant . In that case , the balance of PI4P between the plasma 440 membrane and the TGN would be affected between these two compartments , which could 441 explain the relocalization of the PI4P sensors to TGN compartments . 442 Ultrastructural analyses previously revealed that sac9 massively accumulates vesicles , 443 presumably containing cell wall precursors , in close proximity to the irregular cell wall 444 deposition ( Vollmer et al . 2011 ) . The finding of these unknown subcortical compartments in 445 sac9 resonates with our confocal microscopy observations of ectopic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing 446 vesicles in this mutant . Importantly , we found that these vesicles are not extensively labeled 447 after a short - term FM4 - 64 treatment . This suggests that these vesicles are accumulating 448 slowly over time in the sac9 mutants and are not actively exchanging membrane materials 449 with the TGN / EEs or the plasma membrane , at least not in the 30 - minute time frame of the 450 FM4 - 64 pulse labeling experiment . Moreover , recent proteomic characterization of isolated 451 Arabidopsis clathrin - coated vesicles identified SAC9 as one of the most abundant clathrin - 452 coated vesicles proteome components ( Dahhan et al . 2022 ) . Interestingly , in that study , no 453 other 5 - phosphatase were identified to be associated with clathrin - coated vesicles . Together , 454 we propose that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulation on endocytic vesicles after scission could lead to an 455 altered dynamics of these vesicles , which may be unable to fuse correctly with TGN / EEs , 456 ultimately leading to their accumulation in the cell cortex ( Figure 8 ) . 457 We observed that the endocytic pathway is partially impaired in the absence of SAC9 , and 458 that sac9 was oversensitive to ES9 - 17 - mediated inhibition of endocytosis . In animal cells , 459 membrane protuberances have been reported in cultured cells knocked - out or knock - down for 460 enzymes of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolism ( Gurung et al . 2003 ; Terebiznik et al . 2002 ; Mochizuki and 461 Takenawa 1999 ) . These protuberances could therefore be a conserved process affected by 462 disturbed PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis in both plant and animal cells leading to such plasma 463 membrane distortion . It is not the first observation of plasma membrane protuberances in 464 cells where PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis is affected : upon PIP5K6 over - expression in pollen tubes , 465 which increases PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , plasma membrane invaginations also occurs . The authors 466 elegantly demonstrated that these plasma membrane distortions are due to clathrin - mediated 467 endocytosis defects ( Zhao et al . 2010 ) . These structures were also reported when inducible 468 depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane of root cells was performed using the iDePP 469 system ( Doumane et al . 2021 ) , suggesting that the tight regulation of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 470 metabolism is important for the integrity of the plasma membrane . Previous study on the 471 cellular organization of the primary roots of sac9 - 1 seedlings at ultrastructural level reported 472 the excessive membrane material either in direct contacts or close to the wall forming the 473 protuberances ( Vollmer et al . 2011 ) . The irregular cell wall deposition in the sac9 mutant 474 leads to cell wall ingrowths , coined “whorl - like structures” ( Vollmer et al . 2011 ) . We propose 475 that such protuberances could be a readout of long - term endocytic defects , for instance 476 caused by an excess of plasma membrane due to unbalanced exocytosis . If so , the appearance 477 of plasma membrane protuberances upon PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolism perturbation could be an 478 additional indication of disturbed endocytosis . 479 How could SAC9 regulate endocytosis ? 480 We observed that the endocytic pathway is partially impaired in the absence of SAC9 . We 481 envision several scenarios to explain these endocytic defects . They are not mutually exclusive 482 and ultimately , it would not be surprising if the sac9 endocytic phenotype results from a 483 combination of altered cellular pathways relying , directly or indirectly , on the precise spatio - 484 temporal regulation of anionic lipid homeostasis . First , as mentioned in the paragraph above , 485 the sac9 mutant likely accumulates ectopic vesicle following endocytosis . These vesicles trap 486 membrane components inside the cell , which may overall impact the endocytic process . In 487 addition , it is possible that the localization or dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding proteins , which 488 regulate clathrin - mediated endocytosis , could be impacted , as we observed for SH3P2 and T - 489 PLATE ( Zhuang et al . 2013 ; Yperman et al . 2021b ; Yperman et al . 2021a ) . Other proteins 490 from the T - PLATE complex also interact with anionic lipids , including PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and could 491 be affected in sac9 ( Yperman et al . 2021b ; Yperman et al . 2021a ) . Furthermore , the dynamics 492 of dynamin - related proteins , which contain a lipid - binding plekstrin homology domain , and 493 the AP2 adaptor complex , which relies on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for localization in planta ( Doumane et al . 494 2021 ) , could also be altered in sac9 . It was also recently reported that perturbation of 495 clathrin - containing vesicles at the TGN / EEs also impacts clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( and 496 conversely ) ( Yan et al . 2021 ) . It is thus possible that perturbing phosphoinositides 497 metabolism after the scission of clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane impacts 498 the dynamics of clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the cell surface in an indirect way , for 499 example because of slowed recycling of the clathrin pool or other endocytic components at 500 the surface of TGN / EEs . 501 It is also important to note that bulk endocytosis in general and clathrin - mediated 502 endocytosis in particular are still going - on in the sac9 mutant , albeit at a reduced rate . Thus , 503 while PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 strict exclusion from intracellular membranes is important for the endocytic 504 process , the plant membrane trafficking system appears to be extremely resilient , as it 505 manages to operate despite the accumulation of these membrane of mixed identity inside the 506 cell . Here , we can speculate that SAC9 may not be the only 5 - phosphatase enzyme that can 507 control PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis during endocytosis . In addition , while PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the main 508 phosphoinositide regulating the recruitment of endocytic regulators in animals , it is likely not 509 the case in plants ( Markovic and Jaillais 2022 ) . Indeed , PI4P , not PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is the major 510 anionic lipids that powers the plasma membrane electrostatic field ( Simon et al . 2016 ) , and is 511 very likely key to recruit endocytic proteins in plants ( Yperman et al . 2021b ; Yperman et al . 512 2021a ) . In addition , phosphatidic acid ( PA ) is also important to drive the electrostatic field of 513 the plasma membrane ( Platre et al . 2018 ) and PA could be involved in the localization of 514 AtEH1 / Pan1 , a component of the T - PLATE complex ( Yperman et al . 2021a , Dragwidge et 515 al . , 2022 ) . 516 517 Limitation of the study 518 SAC9 was previously proposed to act as a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase in planta , mainly 519 because the sac9 mutant accumulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Williams et al . 2005 ) . We found an 520 accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensors inside the cells in sac9 , which is fully consistent for a 5 - 521 phosphatase enzyme . However , we could not confirm this activity in vitro . This is mainly due 522 to problems in purifying SAC9 catalytic domain in sufficient quantity . Yet , it represents a 523 weakness of our study that we should keep in mind . Indeed , although this is not the most 524 parsimonious explanation , it is possible that SAC9 is not a 5 - phosphatase and that instead it 525 controls the localization or activity of another enzyme bearing this catalytic activity . 526 Nonetheless , the fact that the putative catalytically inactive mCIT - SAC9 C459A fusion protein 527 does not rescue sac9 macroscopic phenotype and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 localization suggests that SAC9 528 phosphatase activity is required for its function . We showed that the number of BFA bodies 529 labeled with FM4 - 64 in sac9 - 3 vs wild - type is reduced . Such reduction may be due to i ) a 530 lower amount of BFA bodies formed per cell ( i . e . , the number per cell area or volume ) , ii ) 531 reduced FM4 - 64 internalization from the cell surface , or iii ) defects in the balance between 532 endocytic and exocytic trafficking which alter TGN / EE function , iv ) a combination of those . 533 In either case , such decrease suggests that membrane trafficking flux through the endosomal 534 system is impacted in sac9 . 535 To explain the endocytic defects observed in the sac9 mutant , we mainly focused on 536 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mis - patterning . However , biochemical measurements also showed that the sac9 537 mutant accumulates less PI4P than its wild - type counterpart . Given the importance of PI4P 538 for plant cell function ( Markovi ć & Jaillais 2022 ; Noack et al ; , 2022 ; Noack et al . 2020 ; 539 Simon et al . 2016 ) , it is possible that PI4P rather than ( or in combination with ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 540 defects are involved in the sac9 phenotypes . Given that phosphoinositide metabolism is 541 highly intricate , we recognize that it is difficult to fully untangle the specific involvement of 542 each lipid in the observed phenotypes . In addition , the SAC9 protein may carry specific 543 functions outside of its catalytic activity . For example , SAC9 directly interacts with SH3P2 , 544 yet the physiological relevance of this interaction for both SAC9 and SH3P2 function 545 remains unclear . Structure - function analyses aiming at dissecting this interaction will be 546 instrumental to clarify this point . Based on confocal imaging , we concluded that the level of 547 plasma membrane associated SH3P2 - sGFP is reduced in the sac9 mutant . In addition , the 548 overall levels of SH3P2 are not affected in the mutant . Subcellular fractionations and 549 quantitative colocalization analyses between SH3P2 - GFP and compartment markers in the 550 sac9 mutant background will be needed to fully understand how SAC9 impacts SH3P2 551 localization . In addition , the exact function of SH3P2 in endocytosis is also elusive and it 552 will be important to analyze it in details in the future ( Adamowski et al . , 2022 ) . Finally , one 553 of the clear limitations in interpreting the sac9 phenotype , which is common to most genetic 554 approaches , is the accumulation of defects over a long - time period in the mutant . As such , it 555 is impossible to pin - point toward direct or indirect effects of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mis - patterning on the 556 cellular and developmental phenotypes of this mutant . Future studies , aiming at rapidly 557 manipulating SAC9 function and localization in an inducible manner will be instrumental in 558 disentangling the direct and indirect effects of SAC9 on lipid dynamics and endocytosis 559 regulation . 560 561 MATERIALS AND METHODS 562 Cloning 563 SAC9 promoter ( SAC9pro ; 800 bp ) was amplified from Col - 0 genomic DNA using 564 SAC9prom _ fwd _ gb TTGTATAGAAAAGTTGCTATTGAAAAAAGATAGAGGCGCGTG 565 and SAC9prom _ rev _ gb TTTTTTGTACAAACTTGCCTGAGCTCAGGACCAAGCGG 566 primers and the corresponding PCR product was recombined into pDONR - P1RP4 ( life 567 technologieswww . lifetechnologies . com / ) vector by BP reaction to give SAC9pro / pDONR - 568 P1RP4 . The mCIT and TdTOM containing vectors cYFPnoSTOP / pDONR221 and 569 TdTOMnoSTOP / pDONR221 were described before ( Simon et al . , 2014 ; Jaillais et al . , 2011 ) . 570 The genomic sequence of SAC9 ( At3g59770 ) was amplified by PCR using 7 - day old 571 Arabidopsis seedlings gDNA as template and the SAC9 - B2R 572 GGGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGCTATGGATCTGCATCCACCAGGTTAGT 573 and SAC9 - B3wSTOP 574 GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAGTTGCTCAGACACTTGAAAGGCTAGTCCAT 575 primers . The corresponding PCR product was recombined into pDONR - P2RP3 vector by BP 576 reaction to give SAC9g / pDONR - P2RP3 . 577 SAC9 ∆ CC was amplified from SAC9g / pDONR - P2R - P3 with SAC9g _ deltaCC _ C - F 578 / 5phos / ggaattgatccagctacc SAC9g _ deltaCC _ N - R 579 / 5phos / AAGCTTCTTTGCCTGTATTATG primers and then ligated to give SAC9g ∆ CC 580 / pDONR - P2R - P3 . 581 SAC9 C459A mutation was obtained by site - directed mutagenesis using the partially 582 overlapping SAC9 - C459A - F 583 TACGTTTTAACGCTGCTGATTCCTTGGATCGAACAAATGC and SAC9 - C459A - R 584 AGGAATCAGCAGCGTTAAAACGTATCACCCCATTTTGATGTG primers on 585 SAC9g / pDONR - P2RP3 . 586 The gateway expression vector SH3P2shortprom ( 0 . 4 kb ) : SH3P2gDNA - tdTOM was 587 obtained from pDONR P4 - P1R SH3P2 short prom amplified with the primers : attb4 - 588 sh3p2promshortF 589 GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGCTGGTTAAGGGTCTTCTAGATGGTGTAG , 590 attb1 - sh3p2promR 591 GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGCTCTTCACCAGATCAAGAGCTATTCACAA 592 A , pDONR221 / SH3P2g amplified with the primers : attB1 _ SH3P2g _ F 593 GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAACC _ ATGGATGCAATTAGAAAAC 594 AAGCTAG , attB2 _ SH3P2g _ R 595 GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTA _ GAAAACTTCGGACACTTTGCTAGC 596 AAGAAC and pDONR - P2R - P3 TdTOM together with pDEST pH7m34GW by LR GW 597 Final destination vectors were obtained using three fragments LR recombination system ( life 598 technologies , www . lifetechnologies . com / ) using pB7m34GW destination vector ( Karimi et 599 al . 2007 ) . The following reactions were set - up to generate the corresponding destination 600 vectors : UBQ10prom : tdTOM - SAC9g / pH , SAC9prom : mCIT - SAC9g / pB , pAtSAC9 : mCIT - 601 SAC9g DEAD / pB , SAC9prom : TdTOM - SAC9g DEAD / pH , pAtSAC9 : mCIT - SAC9g ∆ CC / pB , 602 SH3P2shortprom : SH3P2gDNA - tdTOM , pUb10 : SH3P2gDNA - tdTOM ( Supplementary File 603 1 ) . 604 605 Growth condition and plant materials 606 Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) accession was used as wild - type ( WT ) reference 607 genomic background throughout this study . Arabidopsis seedlings in vitro on half Murashige 608 and Skoog ( ½ MS ) basal medium supplemented with 0 . 8 % plant agar ( pH 5 . 7 ) in continuous 609 light conditions at 21 °C . Plants were grown in soil under long - day conditions at 21 °C and 610 70 % humidity 16 h daylight . Wild - type Col - 0 and heterozygous ( or homozygous ) sac9 - 3 611 were transformed using the dipping method ( Clough and Bent 1998 ) . 612 For each construct generated in this paper ( UBQ10prom : tdTOM - SAC9g / pH , 613 SAC9prom : mCIT - SAC9g / pB , pAtSAC9 : mCIT - SAC9g DEAD / pB , SAC9prom : TdTOM - 614 SAC9g DEAD / pH , pAtSAC9 : mCIT - SAC9g ∆ CC / pB , SH3P2shortprom : SH3P2gDNA - tdTOM , 615 pUb10 : SH3P2gDNA - tdTOM ) , between 20 and 24 independent T1 were selected on 616 antibiotics ( Basta or hygromycin ) and propagated . In T2 , all lines were screened using 617 confocal microscopy for fluorescence signal and localization . Between 3 to 5 independent 618 lines with a mono - insertion and showing a consistent , representative expression level and 619 localization were selected and grown to the next generation . Each selected line was 620 reanalyzed in T3 by confocal microscopy to confirm the results obtained in T2 and to select 621 homozygous plants . At this stage , we selected one representative line for in depth analysis of 622 the localization and crosses and two representative lines for in depth analysis of mutant 623 complementation . 624 FM4 - 64 staining and drug treatments 625 Seedlings were incubated in wells containing 1 µM FM4 - 64 ( Life Technologies T - 3166 ; 626 from a stock solution of 1 . 645 mM = 1 mg / ml in DMSO ) in half Murashige and Skoog ( ½ 627 MS ) liquid basal medium without shaking for 30 min and in dark . Seedlings were then 628 mounted in the same medium and imaged within a 10 min time frame window ( 1 h ± 5 min ) . 629 Seedlings were incubated in wells containing Brefeldin A ( BFA ; Sigma B7651 ) applied at 50 630 µM ( from a stock solution of 30 mM in DMSO ) , or a corresponding volume of DMSO as 631 ‘mock’ treatment , dissolved in liquid ½ MS for one hour in dark without shaking before 632 mounting in the same medium and imaging . For co - treatment with 50 µM BFA and 1 µM 633 FM4 - 64 , FM4 - 64 and BFA were added at the same time . Imaging was performed within a 14 634 min time frame window ( 1 h ± 7 min ) . 635 For PAO treatment , seedlings were incubated in wells containing 30 μ M PAO ( Sigma P3075 , 636 www . sigmaaldrich . com , PAO stock solution at 60 mM in DMSO ) , or a volume of DMSO as 637 mock treatment , during the indicated time . Roots were imaged within a 10 min time frame 638 window around the indicated time . The PAO effects on the localization of the biosensors 639 were analyzed by counting manually the number of labelled compartments per cell . 640 ES9 - 17 was stored at - 20°C as a 30 mM stock solution in DMSO . Seedlings were incubated 641 in dark without shaking for the indicated duration ( ± 7 min ) in liquid ¼ MS ( pH 5 . 7 ) in wells 642 containing 1 % DMSO to help solubilization of ES9 - 17 , and either 1 µM ES9 - 17 or the 643 corresponding additional volume of DMSO ( mock treatment ) . For 1 µM ES9 - 17 and 1 µM 644 FM4 - 64 , FM4 - 64 was added 30 min after the ES9 - 17 ( the indicated time corresponds to ES9 - 645 17 exposure ) . 646 647 Western - Blot 648 To verify that both T - PLATE and SH3P2 fusion proteins were both identically expressed in 649 wild type and sac9 , 10 - days - old seedlings were grind in liquid nitrogen , weighed and 650 resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer ( 100 (cid:3) mM Tris – HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 (cid:3) mM NaCl , 651 5 (cid:3) mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 10 (cid:3) mM DTT , 0 . 5 % Triton X (cid:3) 100 , 1 % Igepal and 1 % protease 652 inhibitors ( Sigma ) into milliQ water ) and centrifuged at 5000rpm for 10 min at 4°C to obtain 653 the total protein extract in the supernatant . The total protein extract was then filter on column 654 and 100µl of the filtrate denatured with 50µl of Lamelli buffer 3x at 95°C for 5 min . 40 µL of 655 the total protein extract was loaded onto 7 . 5 % polyacrylamide gel , run for 120 min at 120 V 656 and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes 2hours , 100 V on ice . Membrane were then 657 incubated 5min in red - ponceau buffer , washed with milliQ water and imaged . Then 658 membranes were blocked in 5 % milk dissolved in TBST buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCL , 150 mM 659 NaCL , 0 . 05 % Tween20 ) for 1hour . mCIT tagged proteins were revealed by using 660 respectively GFP monoclonal antibody ( anti - GFP mouse monoclonal , Roche ; at 1 / 1000 in 5 661 % milk over - night ) as primary antibodies and anti - mousse IgG - HRP conjugated secondaries 662 antibodies ( Mouse IgG , HRP conjugate W402B , Promega ; 1 / 5000 in TBST , 4 hours ) . As a 663 loading control we used anti - tubulin α antibodies as primary antibodies ( 1 / 1000 in 5 % milk 664 over - night ) . Finally tagged proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL , 665 substrate to HRP enzyme , revelation . 666 667 Transient Expression in N . benthamiana 668 The AtSH3P2 - GFP constructs was described previously ( Leong et al . , 2022 ) . The binary 669 plasmid was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 and transient 670 expression of the construct was performed by infiltration of N . benthamiana leaves at the 671 four - to six - leaf stage . 672 673 Immunoprecipitation 674 To verify that SAC9 fusion proteins were present in the plant cells , leaves from 1 - month - 675 old plants were grind in liquid nitrogen , weighed and resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer 676 ( 100 (cid:3) mM Tris – HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 (cid:3) mM NaCl , 5 (cid:3) mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 10 (cid:3) mM DTT , 677 0 . 5 % Triton X (cid:3) 100 , 1 % Igepal , 100 µM MG132 and 1 % protease inhibitors ( Sigma ) into 678 milliQ water ) and centrifuged at 5000rpm for 10 min at 4°C to obtain the total protein extract 679 in the supernatant . The total protein extract was then filter on column , incubated 40 min with 680 50 µL of magnetic protein G Dynabeads ( Millipore ) fused to a GFP monoclonal antibody 681 ( 1 / 500 in PBS 0 . 002 % tween ) . Beads , antibodies and antibodies bund proteins were 682 magnetically precipitated on columns , eluted and denatured in 40 µL of Laemmli buffer 2X 683 at 95°C for 5 min . 20 µL of the immunoprecipitation was loaded , blotted on nitrocellulose 684 membranes , incubated in red - ponceau buffer and blocked in 5 % milk as previously describe . 685 Tagged SAC9 fusion proteins were revealed by using GFP monoclonal antibody ( anti - GFP 686 mouse monoclonal , Roche ) and detected by chemiluminescence using ECL revelation as for 687 T - PLATE and SH3P2 fusion proteins . 688 689 Pull - down assays in N . benthamiana using GFP - Trap assays were performed as previously 690 described ( Leong et al . , 2022 ) . For immunoblot analysis , protein extracts were separated by 691 SDS - PAGE , transferred to PVDF membranes ( Biorad ) , blocked with5 % skimmed milk in 692 TBS , and incubated with primary antibodies anti - GFP - HRP ( SantaCruz ) antibody using 693 1 : 2000 dilutions in TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . The immunoreaction was developed 694 using an ECL Prime Kit ( GE Healthcare ) and detected with Amersham Imager 680 blot and 695 gel imager . 696 697 Mass spectrometry data analysis 698 Proteins in the N . benthamiana proteome corresponding to the peptide hits were identified 699 according to the annotated proteome ( Kourelis et al . 2019 ) . The proteins were submitted to 700 BLAST ( Sayers et al . 2021 ) to identify their isoform ( s ) in the A . thaliana proteome ( Cheng et 701 al . 2017 ) . The dataset containing the A . thaliana protein ID and peptide counts were 702 submitted to the R package IPinquiry4 ( https : / / github . com / hzuber67 / IPinquiry4 ) which uses a 703 Genewise Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model developed by EdgeR to calculate the 704 log fold - change ( log ( FC ) ) and log10 ( p value ) . 705 706 NanoLC - MS / MS analysis and data processing 707 Proteins were purified on an NuPAGE 12 % gel ( Invitrogen ) and Coomassie - stained gel 708 pieces were digested in gel with trypsin as described previously ( Borchert et al , 2010 ) with a 709 small modification : chloroacetamide was used instead of iodoacetamide for 710 carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues to prevent formation of lysine modifications 711 isobaric to two glycine residues left on ubiquitinylated lysine after tryptic digestion . After 712 desalting using C18 Stage tips peptide mixtures were run on an Easy - nLC 1200 system 713 coupled to a Q Exactive HF - X mass spectrometer ( both Thermo Fisher Scientific ) as 714 described elsewhere ( Kliza et al , 2017 ) with slight modifications : the peptide mixtures were 715 separated using a 87 minute segmented gradient from 10 - 33 - 50 - 90 % of HPLC solvent B 716 ( 80 % acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % formic acid ) in HPLC solvent A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate 717 of 200 nl / min . The seven most intense precursor ions were sequentially fragmented in each 718 scan cycle using higher energy collisional dissociation ( HCD ) fragmentation . In all 719 measurements , sequenced precursor masses were excluded from further selection for 30 s . 720 The target values were 105 charges for MS / MS fragmentation and 3x106 charges for the MS 721 scan . 722 Acquired MS spectra were processed with MaxQuant software package version 1 . 5 . 2 . 8 with 723 integrated Andromeda search engine . Database search was performed against a Nicotiana 724 benthamiana database containing 74 , 802 protein entries . Endoprotease trypsin was defined as 725 protease with a maximum of two missed cleavages . Oxidation of methionine , 726 phosphorylation of serine , threonine and tyrosine , GlyGly dipetide on lysine residues , and N - 727 terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications . Carbamidomethylation on 728 cysteine was set as fixed modification . Initial maximum allowed mass tolerance was set to 729 4 . 5 parts per million ( ppm ) for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions . Peptide , protein 730 and modification site identifications were reported at a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 0 . 01 , 731 estimated by the target - decoy approach ( Elias and Gygi ) . The iBAQ ( Intensity Based 732 Absolute Quantification ) and LFQ ( Label - Free Quantification ) algorithms were enabled , as 733 was the “match between runs” option ( Schwanhäusser et al . 2011 ) . 734 735 Data availability 736 The mass spectrometry data from this publication will be made available on PRIDE archive 737 ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / archive / ) and with the identifier [ PXD033585 ] . 738 739 Live cell imaging 740 Most images ( see exceptions below ) were acquired with the following spinning disk confocal 741 microscope set up : inverted Zeiss microscope ( AxioObserver Z1 , Carl Zeiss Group , 742 http : / / www . zeiss . com / ) equipped with a spinning disk module ( CSU - W1 - T3 , Yokogawa , 743 www . yokogawa . com ) and a ProEM + 1024B camera ( Princeton Instrument , 744 http : / / www . princetoninstruments . com / ) or Camera Prime 95B ( www . photometrics . com ) 745 using a 63x Plan - Apochromat objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 4 , oil immersion ) . GFP and 746 mCITRINE were excited with a 488 nm laser ( 150 mW ) and fluorescence emission was 747 filtered by a 525 / 50 nm BrightLine ! single - band bandpass filter ( Semrock , 748 http : / / www . semrock . com / ) , mCHERRY en TdTOM was excited with a 561 nm laser ( 80 749 mW ) and fluorescence emission was filtered by a 609 / 54 nm BrightLine ! single - band 750 bandpass filter ( Semrock , http : / / www . semrock . com / ) . For quantitative imaging , pictures of 751 epidermal root meristem cells were taken with detector settings optimized for low 752 background and no pixel saturation . Care was taken to use similar confocal settings when 753 comparing fluorescence intensity or for quantification . 754 Colocalization experiments were performed on an inverted Zeiss CLSM710 confocal 755 microscope or an inverted Zeiss CLSM800 confocal microscope and inverted Zeiss 756 CLSM980 confocal microscope using a 63x Plan - apochromatic objective . Dual - color images 757 were acquired by sequential line switching , allowing the separation of channels by both 758 excitation and emission . In the case of colocalization , we also controlled for a complete 759 absence of channel crosstalk . GFP was excited with a 488 nm laser , mCIT was excited with a 760 515nm laser and mCH / tdTOM were excited with a 561 nm laser . Imaging was performed in 761 the root epidermis in cells that are at the onset of elongation . Only cells imaged at their Zi 762 where considered for the colocalization analysis . 763 764 Yeast two - hybrid screen 765 The yeast two hybrid screen was performed by hybrigenics services 766 ( https : / / www . hybrigenics - services . com / contents / our - services / interaction - discovery / ultimate - 767 y2h - 2 ) , using the ULTImate Y2H screen against their Universal Arabidopsis Normalized 768 library obtained using oligo _ dT .

The 785 screen was performed on 0 . 5 mM 3AT . 59 million interactions were analyzed , and 260 786 positive clones were sequenced ( ATNOR _ dT _ hgx4515v1 _ pB66 , Supplementary File 1B . 787 788 TIRF imaging 789 3 days old etiolated seedlings were used for hypocotyl epidermal cells observations . TIRF - 790 VAEM imaging were made using an ilas2 TIRF microscope ( Roper Scientific ) with 100x 791 Apo NA 1 . 46 Oil objective and a Prime 95B camera ( Photometrics , 792 https : / / www . photometrics . com / ) and 1 . 5 coverslips were used ( VWR 61 - 0136 ) . Time lapses 793 were acquired during 300 time - points for 300s ( acquisition time 500ms ) . Spot density were 794 measured using Spot _ detector ImageJ macro ( Bayle et al . 2017 ) . Since the data below 5 795 seconds and beyond 70 seconds exceeds the typical lifetime of the clathrin coated vesicle at 796 the plasma membrane , we removed them from the analysis . 797 Because manual verification of TPLATE - GFP lifetimes is greatly limited by the number of 798 CCVs that can be detected , particle identification and tracking were performed using ImageJ 799 plugin Trackmate ( https : / / research . pasteur . fr / fr / software / trackmate / ) . Trajectories were 800 reconstructed following a three - stage workflow : ( i ) detection of peaks potentially associated 801 with fluorescent emitters , ( ii ) quality test and estimation of the subpixel position and ( iii ) 802 track reconnection . To discriminate between signal and background , particular attention has 803 been paid to the size and shape of the observable objects . Particle of minimum size 0 . 5 with a 804 threshold of 50 and a contrast > 0 . 04 were filtered , to capture as many spots as possible 805 without background . For many reasons , such as variation in fluorescent intensity , loss of 806 focus or photobleaching , the emitter can be missing for several time points causing the 807 premature stop of tracks . Therefore , the maximum number of frames separating two 808 detections was set to three frames ( Bayle et al . 2021 ) . As a final verification , a visual 809 inspection of the tracks can be performed on a reconstituted image , where all the tracks from 810 a movie are represented . 811 2000 tracks were selected per acquisition starting from frame 5 to avoid segmenting truncated 812 tracks . Acquisition were made on 7 hypocotyl cells from three different plants per genotype 813 and per replicate . 814 815 Dissociation indexes 816 Dissociation indexes of membrane lipid fluorescent biosensors were measured and calculated 817 as previously described ( Platre et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , we calculated “indexNoDex” , defined as 818 the ratio between the fluorescence intensity ( Mean Grey Value function of Fiji software ) 819 measured in two elliptical regions of interest ( ROIs ) from the plasma membrane region ( one 820 at the apical / basal plasma membrane region and one in the lateral PM region ) and two 821 elliptical ROIs in the cytosol in the mock condition . For quantification , we used FAPP - E50A 822 as a positive control , since the delocalization of a biosensor from the plasma membrane to the 823 cytoplasm helps us to use automatic tools . 824 825 Measures , counting and statistical analysis 826 Primary root length and number of lateral roots were manually measured from pictures . For 827 comparing the primary root length and lateral root density between each genotype , we used a 828 one - way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey HSD pairwise tests ( 95 % confidence level ) . 829 For quantitative imaging , pictures of epidermal root meristem cells were taken with detector 830 settings optimized for low background and no pixel saturation . Care was taken to use similar 831 confocal settings when comparing fluorescence intensity . Pseudo - colored images were 832 obtained using the “Green Fire Blue” look - up - table ( LUT ) of Fiji software 833 ( http : / / www . fiji . sc / ) . The intracellular compartments ( “spots” ) per cell were automatically 834 counted . 835 We automatically measured the density of intracellular compartments labeled per root using 836 the procedure described in ( Bayle et al . 2017 ) for each biosensor , and we used two - sided non - 837 parametric Wilcoxon rank - sum tests to compare Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - genotypes in Figure 4 . To 838 account for multiple testing , we used a Bonferroni correction and lowered the significance 839 level of each test at alpha = 0 . 05 / 11 = 0 . 004 . 840 To assess the effect of the inhibitor PAO on anomalous mCIT - TUBBYc intracellular 841 compartments , we manually counted their number per cell . We tested PAO effect and the 842 effect of treatment duration ( 30 min and 2 h ) on the number of marked intracellular 843 compartments using a generalized linear mixed - effect model ( Poisson family ) to account for 844 image ID as a random factor . Two sided post - hoc tests were performed using the R package 845 “lsmeans” ( Russell et al . , 2016 ) . We compared the number of FM4 - 64 positive compartments 846 in Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - using a generalized linear mixed model ( Poisson family ) to account for 847 image ID ( id est root ) as a random factor . 848 The density of FM4 - 64 labeled compartments was also compared in Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - using 849 a linear mixed model accounting for image ID as a random factor , followed by a Wald χ 2 test 850 ( function Anova in R package “car” ) . 851 To compare the effects of BFA on FM4 - 64 we tried to automatically count the number and 852 size of the BFA bodies in Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - seedlings , but the analysis was not optimal to 853 treat the images acquired for sac9 - 3 . We therefore manually counted the number of BFA 854 body per cell in multiple samples , using the same region of the root . We then compared the 855 results of the BFA treated Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - seedlings using a generalized linear mixed 856 model ( Poisson family ) with image ID ( id est root ) as a random factor ( Wald χ 2 test : χ 2 = 857 33 . 8 , p < 0 . 001 ) . To compare the effects of BFA on Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - seedings expressing 858 PIN2 - GFP , we counted manually and compared the treatments BFA - Col - 0 with BFA - Sac9 - 3 859 using a generalized linear mixed model ( Poisson family ) with image ID ( id est root ) as a 860 random factor . ( Wald χ 2 test : χ 2 = 42 . 1 , p < 0 . 001 ) . For the dissociation index analysis , we 861 performed all our statistical analyses in R ( v . 3 . 6 . 1 , ( R Core Team , 2019 ) , using R studio 862 interface and the packages ggplot2 ( Wickham 2016 ) , lme4 ( Bates et al . 2014 ) , car ( Fox and 863 Weisberg 2011 ) , multcomp ( Hothorn et al . 2008 ) and lsmeans ( Lenth and Lenth 2018 ) . To 864 compare TPLATE - GFP density between Col - 0 and sac9 - 3 - / - we used a two - sided non - 865 parametric Kruskal Wallis rank - sum tests for each replicate and obtained each time a 866 statistical difference ( p . value < 0 . 05 between the two genotypes ) . Graphs were obtained with 867 R and R - studio software using the package “ggplot2” , and customized with Inkscape 868 ( https : / / inkscape . org ) . 869 870 Quantification of mCIT - SAC9 compartment densities and colocalization with 871 compartments markers 872 Because the signal of mCIT - SAC9 is mainly diffused in the cytosol , no automatic spot 873 detection could be used for quantification of densities and colocalization analyses in Figure 2 , 874 3 , and 6 . Therefore , for comparing the number of intracellular compartments containing 875 mCIT - SAC9 or mCIT - SAC9 C459A protein - fusions per cell across conditions , we manually 876 counted them and used either a generalized linear mixed - effect model ( Poisson family ) for 877 counting comparisons or a linear mixed effect model ( and associated ANOVAs ) for density 878 comparisons , accounting for image ID ( id est root ) as a random factor . 879 Since the localization of the marker for the membrane compartment was larger in z compared 880 to the restricted localization of SAC9 ( only present close to the surface of the cell ) , we 881 counted the number of mCIT - SAC9 labeled structures which were also labelled by the 882 compartment markers in the cell cortex ( Zi plane ) . The percentage of endosomes labelled by 883 mCIT - SAC9 or mCIT - SAC9C459A colocalizing with a given marker , counted manually are 884 presented in the graphs . Positive colocalization was called when the compartment marker was 885 present as a dotted structured overlaying the mCit - SAC9 signal . 886 The same approach was used to deduce the localization of the mutated version of SAC9 . 887 After running our mixed models , we subsequently computed two - sided Tukey post hoc tests 888 ( function glht in R package “multcomp” , Horthorn et al . , 2008 ) to specifically compare each 889 pair of conditions . ” 890 891 892 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 893 We are grateful to the SiCE group ( RDP , Lyon , France ) , Dr Yohann Boutté ( LBM , 894 Bordeaux , France ) , Dr Fabrice Besnard and Dr Nicolas Doll ( RDP , Lyon , France ) , Hugo 895 Ducuing ( INMG , Lyon , France ) , Sébastien This ( CIRI , Lyon , France ) and Augustin Le 896 Bouquin ( IGFL , Lyon , France ) , Dr Sophie Piquerez ( IPS2 , Paris - Saclay , France ) for 897 comments and discussions .

Model for the mode of action of SAC9 in regulating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 subcellular patterning . In wild type plants , 1047 SAC9 restricts the localization of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane allowing endocytic processes to occur . In the absence of 1048 SAC9 , endocytosis PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulates in atypical endomembrane compartments that are no longer able to fuse with the 1049 TGN possibly because of their abnormal anionic lipid signature . SAC9 interacts with SH3P2 close to the plasma membrane . 1050 The defects in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 patterning in absence of SAC9 leads to decreasing of the endocytic rate and the formation of 1051 membrane protuberances in contact with the plasma membrane . Note that in this model , the observed increase in 1052 intracellular PI4P levels as measured by probes is not included . 1053 1054 1055 1056 1057 1058 1059 Figure 1 - figure supplement 1 .
