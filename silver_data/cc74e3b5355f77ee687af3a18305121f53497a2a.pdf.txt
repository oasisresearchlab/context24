The Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein are important regulators of the actin network in the lamellipodium . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates branches of new actin ﬁlaments oﬀ the sides of existing ﬁlaments , while capping protein is a protein that attaches to the end of existing actin ﬁlaments and stops them from polymerizing further at that end . My research consists of three separate projects . First , I study the kinetics of the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein through a reaction diﬀusion model that has been motivated from previous modeling work by Smith et al . [ 1 ] which uses SiMS ( Single Molecule Speckle microscopy ) data from Naoki Watanabe ( Kyoto University ) . In this work I utilize this model to run simulations of FRAP ( Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching ) which are then compared with experimental data from Lai et al . [ 2 ] and Kapustina et al . [ 3 ] Second , I developed a reaction diﬀusion model for actin that models turnover of actin in the lamellipodium which also utilizes SiMS data in order to compare to experimental photoactivation data from Eric Vitriol and James Zheng ( Emory University ) . This model includes eﬀects of knocking down Thymosin β 4 on actin kinetics within the lamellipodium . Third , I developed a 3D whole cell model with particle diﬀusion . This model accounts for the eﬀect of geometry of the cell on the kinetics of actin where our previous model and simulation mentioned above did not . It also accounts for kinetics and turnover of actin within the cell center while our previous models mentioned above only accounted for actin within 1 the lamellipodium . In the ﬁrst part , we study the distribution of capping protein ( CP ) and Arp2 / 3 protein complex that regulate actin polymerization in the lamellipodium through capping and nucleation of free barbed ends . We modeled the kinetics of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex in the lamellipodium using data from prior SiMS mi - croscopy experiments . In these experiments , slowly - diﬀusing proteins appear as ex - tended clouds while proteins bound to the actin ﬁlament network appear as speckles that undergo retrograde ﬂow . Speckle appearance and disappearance events cor - respond to assembly and dissociation from the actin ﬁlament network and speckle lifetimes correspond to the dissociation rate . We use the measured rates of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex in a Monte Carlo simulation that includes particles in association with a ﬁlament network and diﬀuse in the cytoplasm . We consider two separate pools of diﬀuse proteins , representing fast and slowly - diﬀusing species . Ac - counting for the observed slowly - diﬀusing cytoplasmic pool of capping protein with diﬀusion coeﬃcients on the order of 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s , which could represent severed actin ﬁlament fragments or membrane - bound capping protein , leads to gradients in the diﬀuse pool . We show that the results of models with such slow diﬀusion coeﬃcients are consistent with prior FRAP experiments . By comparing single molecule data to prior FRAP experiments of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we provide estimates for the ratio of bound to diﬀuse complexes and calculate conditions where Arp2 / 3 recycling by diﬀusion may become limiting . We discuss the implications of slowly diﬀusing pop - ulations and suggest experiments to distinguish among mechanisms that inﬂuence long range transport . Second , we have developed a diﬀusion - reaction model useful generally for actin in the lamellipodium with three distinct diﬀusive species of actin : recycled , cytoplasmic , and membrane - bound actin . The actin bound to the actin network can dissociate into recycled actin , R , which could be the slowly diﬀusing oligomers mentioned above . The recycled actin can reversibly rebind to the network or become faster diﬀusing cytoplasmic actin , G C , with a lifetime τ R . Fast diﬀusing cytoplasmic actin , G C , can 2 reversibly bind to the network or become bound to the membrane with a spatially dependent rate , k ( x ) , where x is the distance from the leading edge of the cell . Then the membrane bound protein , G M , can either bind to the network , or it can turn back into fast diﬀusing cytoplasmic protein , G C , with a lifetime , τ M . The rates for the diﬀuse pools of actin to become bound actin are calculated using SiMS data . This model is described by a set of partial diﬀerential equations . These partial diﬀerential equations are solved by allowing them to relax using the Monte Carlo method in a 2D particle simulation . FRAP and photoactivation can be modeled with this simulation by deleting particles in a region of interest ( or outside the ROI ) and advancing the simulation in time . Our 2D particle simulation is then propagated through time using the Monte Carlo method . In this section we conclude that diﬀusion is fast enough for delivery of diﬀuse actin to the leading edge of the cell and suggest that Thymosin β 4 aids in the fast diﬀusion of diﬀuse actin through the lamellipodium to the leading edge of the cell . Third , we created a 3D model of the whole cell that includes only reaction and diﬀusion of actin . In doing this , we show that diﬀusion is suﬃcient for movement of actin to various parts of the cell without the need for an active transport mechanism which has been a matter of debate . The diﬀusion , however , is close to limiting . In the lamellipodium of our simulated cell we use a previously established model ( from the previous two sections ) which includes two diﬀuse pools of actin , one which is slowly diﬀusing and the other which diﬀuses more quickly , as well as a pool representing actin bound to the ﬁlamentous network . One diﬀerence is that we adjust this model to ﬁt a circular geometry for the lamellipodium around the whole cell . We also consider actin in the cell center which is either diﬀuse or in ﬁlamentous form and can react to become the other state . The ﬁlamentous actin in the cell center is assumed to be either cortical actin or stress ﬁbers . In this model the rates in which actin reacts to become another pool are taken from measurements done by SiMS and FRAP . With this whole cell model we are then able to simulate photoactivation and FRAP in various parts of the cell to compare with experiment and show that 3 diﬀusion and reaction can account for the eﬀects seen in these studies with the ratio of polymerized actin to diﬀuse actin in the cell middle being an important factor . We discuss the implications for the proposal of the existence of diﬀuse actin speciﬁcally targeted to cell sub - compartments . 4 Chapter 1 Introduction to Actin Dynamics in the Lamellipodium 1 . 1 Lamellipodium of crawling cells Cells move by various methods : blebbing , ﬂagella , and crawling . In this dissertation we model proteins within the lamellipodium on cells that move by crawling with a lamellipodium . A lamellipodium is a thin ( 100 - 200 nm thick ) sheet like protrusion on a cell ( Figure 1 . 1 A ) . The lamellipodium is responsible for aiding in movement of cells that crawl . Within the lamellipodium there are many proteins . The protein that is responsible for much of the structure within the lamellipodium is actin . Actin is a globular protein that can polymerize and form a ﬁlament that is a double - stranded right - handed helix . There are many other proteins within the lamellipodium whose function is to regulate various aspects of actin polymerization and depolymerization . Within the lamellipodium , actin forms a densely branched network , an example of this is shown in Figure 1 . 1 . This image is taken using electron microscopy and the cell type is a ﬁsh keratocyte [ 4 ] . From this image , it can be seen that close to the leading edge the actin network is densely branched while far from the leading edge the ﬁlaments are long and not densely branched which suggests that some remodeling 5 occurs in between those spaces since retrograde ﬂow is occurring which is a ﬂow rearward of the entire network away from the leading edge [ 4 ] . A B Figure 1 . 1 : A ) Cartoon of a crawling cell . B ) Example of electron microscopy images of the actin network within the lamellipodium [ 4 ] Actin is a polar ﬁlament and has a barbed and pointed end . The barbed end has a higher aﬃnity than the pointed end for adding new monomers to its end while the pointed end has a higher aﬃnity for depolymerizing than the barbed end does [ 4 ] . Filamentous actin is also referred to as F - actin . Monomeric actin is also called G - actin which stands for globular actin . In the dendritic nucleation model described in [ 4 ] and shown in Figure 1 . 2 many actin regulators are present and each has a diﬀerent function . In this model , F - actin undergoes retrograde ﬂow away from the leading edge . As the ATP actin hydrolyzes and becomes ATP actin it will begin to disassemble away from the leading edge 6 either spontaneously or with the assistance of coﬁlin , which is a protein that aids in speeding actin ﬁlament severing , and it may disassemble into small pieces of ﬁlament called oligomers or it may disassemble directly into monomers [ 5 ] . It is unclear if the oligomers completely depolymerize or if they then rebind to the network [ 1 ] . Figure 1 . 2 : Dendritic Nucleation model from [ 4 ] Some important regulating proteins within the lamellipodium are the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein . The Arp2 / 3 complex is an actin ﬁlament nucleator : it binds to the side of a pre - existing actin ﬁlament and then a new actin ﬁlament begins to grow oﬀ the old ﬁlament at an angle of 70 degrees between the two ﬁlaments [ 4 ] . Before the Arp2 / 3 complex can bind to an actin ﬁlament and nucleate a new ﬁlament must be activated ﬁrst by an activating protein complex such as WASp or other various activators . WASP localizes near the membrane at the leading edge 7 and so the Arp2 / 3 complex must diﬀuse to the membrane so that it can bind to WASP . Recent experiments suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp then diﬀuse together laterally along the membrane until they ﬁnd a ﬁlament to bind to the ﬁlamentto in which case the activated Arp2 / 3 complex will bind and WASP will fall oﬀ [ 6 ] . Capping protein binds to the barbed end of the actin ﬁlament and prevents more actin monomers from being added to the ﬁlament . For in vitro studies , capping pro - tein tends to stay bound to the actin network with a lifetime on the order of minutes [ 7 ] , whereas in vivo studies ﬁnd that capping protein has a lifetime of association of about 2 s [ 8 ] . In this thesis , we are trying to study how speciﬁc proteins individually associate and dissociate with the actin network in the lamellipodium . Our modeling focuses only on one protein at a time and does not directly take into account the eﬀect of other proteins on the protein of interest . While modeling a certain protein we are interested in the eﬀect of kinetics and turnover of that protein and the eﬀect of slow diﬀusion ( compared to an actin monomer ) being included in the protein model . We want to know how oligomers ( small fragments of ﬁlament that are slowly diﬀusing ) aﬀect the dynamics of the actin network . We also want to answer whether diﬀusion is fast enough to allow protein to get to the leading edge of the cell or if active transport is needed to aid in this . We are also interested in understanding the eﬀect of geometry on diﬀusion of protein within the cell as well as how actin within the center of the cell aﬀects actin dynamics within the lamellipodium ; however , gradients can exist within the concentration proﬁles of each protein which suggests that diﬀusion would have some limits . In this chapter I will introduce experimental methods that measure protein dy - namics within live cells in order to understand how these techniques work especially in the context of comparing our simulations to experimental results produced by these methods . Some methods that will be discussed are : ﬂuorescence recovery af - ter photobleaching , single molecule speckle microscopy , photoactivation , ﬂuorescence 8 decay after photoactivation , and ﬂuorescence loss after photobleaching . Then I will introduce a previous model by Smith et al . [ 1 ] that I will later build upon to create some more accurate models for the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein as well as a model for actin that allows for the ability of the protein to bind to the membrane . I will also utilize this model in a whole cell model where I use the model from Smith et al . [ 1 ] for the reaction and diﬀusion of actin protein within the cell’s lamellipodium . We will show that diﬀusion is fast enough for delivery of protein to the leading edge through our reaction diﬀusion models that compare well with experimental data . 1 . 2 Experimental methods for measuring protein dynamics in live cells Observing protein movement within a live cell can be diﬃcult because techniques that allow the best resolution within the cell also often require killing the cell , this defeats the purpose of observing protein dynamics . Below are a few techniques that involve live cell imaging . 1 . 2 . 1 Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching ( FRAP ) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) is a technique in which the cell is made to express a ﬂuorescently tagged target protein [ 9 ] . A laser is shown in the region of interest ( ROI ) and the laser makes the ﬂuorophores in that region stop ﬂuorescing . For the duration of the experiment the ﬂuorescent tag on the protein remains oﬀ . There are still ﬂuorescently labeled proteins outside the region of interest at the time of bleaching which are then free to diﬀuse and then react in the ROI . An example of experimental FRAP is shown in Figure 1 . 3 A . In the 2nd panel down the ﬂuorescence of EGFP - actin near the leading edge of the lamellipodium has been turned oﬀ in the ROI , but then as time progresses more ﬂuorescence can be seen coming into the ROI . This is the recovery in intensity which is monitored and can 9 be seen in graphs in Figures 1 . 3 B and C , which monitors both the front ( 0 - 0 . 5 µ m from the leading edge ) and back ( 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 µ m from the leading edge . ) Figure 1 . 3 : Example of FRAP of EGFP - actin in XTC cells at leading edge in Smith et al . [ 1 ] ( A ) Experimental FRAP performed on XTC cells , Left column : mCherry - actin tagged , center column : EGFP - actin tagged , right column : ratio of EGFP - actin to mCherry - actin channel [ 1 ] ( B ) Normalized recovery curves of a single FRAP experiment with the front curve measured from 0 - 0 . 5 µ m and the back measured from 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 µ m from the leading edge . [ 1 ] ( C ) FRAP recovery curves for 3 experiments instead of one , measured in the same way as in ( B ) [ 1 ] From these curves it is possible to measure the recovery times to learn about time scale of the turnover of the actin network . It is also possible to measure the retrograde ﬂow rate from the recovery curves . One problem with FRAP is that the laser intensity used in order to turn oﬀ the ﬂuorophores is often very high . A very 10 intense laser has the potential to cause damage to the cell which is why it is very important to monitor the cell throughout the experiment to make sure damage is not occuring . The left column of Figure 1 . 3 A is an example of a control experiment to watch the underlying actin structures to ensure they are not damaged within the cell by the laser [ 1 ] . 1 . 2 . 2 Single Molecule Speckle Microscopy ( SiMS ) Single molecule speckle microscopy ( SiMS ) is a live cell imaging technique for ob - serving single molecules moving within a cell . The cell is made to express a very low concentration of a GFP - tagged protein as opposed to a high concentration of EGFP - actin , an example of which is seen in Figure 1 . 4 A [ 10 ] . Then a portion of the lamellipodium is imaged such that it is possible to see single ﬂuorophores . The imaging takes place with an exposure time of the camera which is typically 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 s . This exposure time makes is possible to see ﬂuorophores which are bound to the network very brightly as speckles and diﬀusing ﬂuorophores are seen as broadly distributed clouds [ 1 ] . A speckle is deﬁned as a single ﬂuorophore which is bound to protein that has incorporated into the actin network [ 10 ] . Examples of these speckles can be seen in Figure 1 . 4 B . Since the speckles appear when they bind to the network , where the binding event occurs can be measured as a function of distance from the leading edge . These events can be recorded and then binned into a histogram of appearances shown in Figure 1 . 4 C which is called an appearance proﬁle . How long the speckle remains attached to the actin network is also measured . The speckle is tracked throughout time , and the time the speckle remains bound is called the speckle lifetime . The speckle lifetimes are binned and put into a histogram of speckle lifetimes shown in Figure 1 . 4 D . Similarly to FRAP it is possible to measure the retrograde ﬂow of the network along with time scales of the turnover with SiMS microscopy . However SiMS mi - croscopy can also give information about protein dynamics at a small scale including 11 Figure 1 . 4 : Example of XTC SiMS data ( A ) Example of XTC cell expressing EGFP - actin at a concentration high enough to see structures such as F - actin bundles within lamellipodium Scale bar 8 µ m [ 1 ] ( B ) Example of SiMS image of small portion of the lamellipodium .

Scale bar 8 µ m [ 1 ] information about binding and unbinding events . 12 1 . 2 . 3 Photoactivation ( PA ) Photoactivation is a technique in which a live cell is made to express a protein that has an attached photoactivatable ﬂuorescent tag . A laser is then shown on the region of interest [ 11 ] . This makes the tags within the ROI begin to ﬂuoresce . One can then watch how the ﬂuorescence decays within the ROI and how the ﬂuorescence then moves outside of the ROI [ 11 ] . An example of this technique is seen in Figure 1 . 5 where the entire center of the cell is photoactivated . Then the ﬂuorescence quickly moves to the leading edge of the cell [ 12 ] . The ﬂuorescence intensity increase at the leading edge and the ﬂuorescence intensity decrease in the center of the cell can be quantiﬁed over time in Figure 1 . 5 B .

( A ) Example of Photoactivation of cell center in [ 12 ] ( B ) Normalized ﬂuorescence intensities over time in the cell center and at the leading edge from [ 12 ] 1 . 2 . 4 Fluorescence Decay after Photoactivation ( FDAP ) Fluorescence decay after photoactivation is a technique in which a region is photoac - tivated and then the decay in ﬂuorescence within that region is observed to study how diﬀusion and reaction of the ﬂuorescently tagged protein is occurring within that region . Another method of FDAP is s - FDAP which stands for sequential - FDAP and is used to measure changes in a protein’s localization and movement within a cell as well as the concentration of the photoactivated protein [ 13 ] . A diagram of the process of FDAP is shown in Figure 1 . 6 A . First the entire sample is photobleached to allow for less noise , then a small portion of the sample is photoactivated and allowed to 13 decay in ﬂuorescence intensity . The ﬂuorescence decay is monitored and once a new plateau of ﬂuorescence is reached a mobile and immobile fraction can be measured against the original ﬂuorescence level as seen in the ﬁgure [ 13 ] . Figure 1 . 6 B shows what a graph of the intensity of the ﬂuorescence would look like over time for FDAP [ 13 ] . Figure 1 . 6 : Example of FDAP from Kiuchi et al .

Figure from [ 13 ] 14 1 . 2 . 5 Fluorescence Loss after Photobleaching ( FLAP ) The technique ﬂuorescence loss after photobleaching ( FLAP ) is very similar to the technique ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . Both techniques in - volve a cell expressing a certain ﬂuorescent protein and then turning oﬀ that ﬂuores - cence within a certain region . The diﬀerence is that with FRAP , the region that is bleached is the region of interest and the recovery of ﬂuorescence within that region is monitored . However , with FLAP , how the loss of ﬂuorescence spreads throughout the cell is more of interest than the region that is bleached [ 14 ] . 1 . 3 Previous Models of Actin Turnover in the Lamel - lipodium Previous work on modeling EGFP - actin FRAP data while utilizing actin SiMS data was done in [ 1 ] . This was done in order to address a controversy in the ﬁeld which is that SiMS and FRAP data seem to disagree . Most of the FRAP recovery occurs very near to the leading edge which would mean that almost all the binding events to F - actin also occur very near to the leading edge ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . However , SiMS microscopy data shows that binding to the actin network is actually distributed throughout the lamellipodium as seen in Figure 1 . 4 C . In the paper by Smith et al . [ 1 ] , two models are presented : a model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species and the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events [ 1 ] . The model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species in Figure 1 . 7 A allows for only two pools of actin : F - actin and G - actin , while the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events which is in Figure 1 . 7 B allows for three pools of actin : F - actin , G - actin and O - actin . F - actin is ﬁlamentous actin , G - actin is globular actin ( or monomeric actin ) and O - actin is oligomeric actin . The appearance rate ( Figure 1 . 4 C ) is used in the calculation of the rates to 15 A B Figure 1 . 7 : Two models in Smith et al . ( A ) Diagram representing model with monomers as only diﬀuse actin species ( B ) Diagram representing model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events [ 1 ] become F - actin is deﬁned as a ( x ) = G ∞ K (cid:2) A 1 e − x / λ 1 + A 2 e − x / λ 2 (cid:3) , ( 1 . 1 ) where x is the distance from the leading edge and the constants A 1 , A 2 , λ 1 , and λ 2 in 1 . 1 are found by ﬁtting the appearance proﬁle found using the SiMS appearance proﬁle and ﬁtting it with a double exponential [ 1 ] . It is imposed for this deﬁnition that A 1 + A 2 = 1 . In the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events the term in this appearance rate with λ 1 corresponds to the appearances due to G - actin , while the term with λ 2 corresponds to the appearances due to O - actin . The parameter G ∞ is the concentration of G - actin far from the leading edge , and the parameter K adjusts the ratios of F - to G - actin . Lifetimes measured in the SiMS microscopy technique ( Figure 1 . 4 D ) can also be ﬁtted with a double exponential : p ( t ) p 0 = C 1 e − t / τ 1 + C 2 e − t / τ 2 , ( 1 . 2 ) where τ 1 and τ 2 are lifetimes of F - actin and C 1 and C 2 are coeﬃcients that allow for a good ﬁt to the measured histogram of lifetimes from SiMS . 16 The appearance proﬁle ( Equation 1 . 1 ) and the lifetime distribution ( Equation 1 . 2 ) are then used to ﬁnd the proﬁle of F - actin concentration . In order to ﬁnd the bound proﬁle , a Green’s function is needed : Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) = Θ ( x − x (cid:48) ) 1 v r ∞ (cid:90) x − x (cid:48) vr p ( t ) dt . ( 1 . 3 ) This Green’s function tells how much F - actin that starts at x (cid:48) moves to x by retrograde ﬂow ( v r ) without dissociating [ 1 ] . The F - actin steady state proﬁle as a function of distance from the leading edge can then be written : F ( x ) = ∞ (cid:90) 0 Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) a ( x (cid:48) ) dx (cid:48) . ( 1 . 4 ) The function , F ( x ) , can then be used to write diﬀusion reaction equations for the model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species ( Figure 1 . 7 A ) . The retrograde ﬂow of F - actin is balanced by appearances and disappearances , as is the diﬀusion of G - actin [ 1 ] v r ∂F ( x ) ∂x = D ∂ 2 G ( x ) ∂x 2 = a ( x ) − d ( x ) . ( 1 . 5 ) In this equation , G ( x ) is the G - actin concentration proﬁle as a function of distance from the leading edge . Equation 1 . 5 can then be solved for G ( x ) , G ( x ) = G ∞ − v r D ∞ (cid:90) x F ( x (cid:48) ) dx (cid:48) . ( 1 . 6 ) Both G ( x ) and F ( x ) are shown in Figure 1 . 8 A - B for the model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species with K values of 0 . 5 s − 1 or 0 . 75 s − 1 respectively and a retrograde ﬂow rate of v r = 0 . 05 µ m / s and a diﬀusion coeﬃcient of D = 4 µ m / s 2 [ 1 ] . 17 A B C D Figure 1 . 8 : Steady State proﬁles for model with single diﬀuse species and model with two diﬀuse species ( A - B ) Steady state proﬁles for the model with only monomers as diﬀuse species with diﬀerent K values ( C - D ) Steady state proﬁles for the model with monomers and oligomers as diﬀuse species with diﬀerent K values [ 1 ] Then with these models , the authors in [ 1 ] implemented a stochastic 2D particle simulation to simulate FRAP . The rates in which the diﬀuse protein becomes F - actin are , r G → F ( x ) = a G ( x ) G ( x ) . ( 1 . 7 ) The rates for the model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species are shown in Figure 1 . 9 A . FRAP is simulated by deleting all particles within the region of interest . The system then advances forward in time where at each time step , the program then decides how to advance each particle based on the rules that follow . If the particle is in the G - actin pool , then the particle can bind with the 18 rate given in equation 1 . 7 or if it does not bind the particle in the G - actin pool will diﬀuse . If the particle is in the F - actin pool , then the lifetime of that particle is compared to the time in which that particle has been in the F - actin pool . When the lifetime is up the particle in the F - actin pool goes into the G - actin pool and begins to diﬀuse . An example of the FRAP simulation for the model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species is shown in Figure 1 . 9 B and the recovery for FRAP is shown in Figure 1 . 9 C where the front recovery and back recovery are monitored . The front is deﬁned as 0 - 0 . 5 µ m from the leading edge while the back is deﬁned as 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 µ m from the leading edge . This is compared to experimental FRAP data which is included in Figure 1 . 9 C for comparison . The parameter K is varied to ﬁnd a ﬁt to the experimental data and a value of K of 0 . 75 s − 1 has the best ﬁt to experimental data [ 1 ] . The front of the lamellipodium recovers quickly , while comparatively the back of the lamellipodium recovers more slowly . However , the back recovery does have a small amount of initial recovery that is very slow until the retrograde ﬂow brings the F - actin that assembled near the leading edge to the back of the lamellipodium which causes recovery to happen much more quickly . In the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events shown in Figure 1 . 7 B the steady state reaction diﬀusion equations are as follows v r ∂F ( x ) ∂x = a o ( x ) + a G ( x ) − d ( x ) ( 1 . 8 ) D G ∂ 2 G ( x ) ∂x 2 = a G ( x ) − 1 τ o O ( x ) ( 1 . 9 ) D o ∂ 2 O ( x ) ∂x 2 = a o ( x ) − d ( x ) + 1 τ o O ( x ) ( 1 . 10 ) F - actin is the same as given in Equation 1 . 4 [ 1 ] . Equations 1 . 8 - 1 . 10 can be solved analytically for O ( x ) and G ( x ) : O ( x ) = τ o cosh (cid:18) x √ D o τ o (cid:19) ∞ (cid:90) o f ( x (cid:48) ) exp (cid:18) − x (cid:48) √ D o τ o (cid:19) dx (cid:48) − τ o x (cid:90) 0 f ( x (cid:48) ) sinh (cid:18) x − x (cid:48) √ D o τ o (cid:19) dx (cid:48) , ( 1 . 11 ) 19 A B C Figure 1 . 9 : Recovery from model with monomers as only diﬀuse species ( A ) Reaction rates from both G - actin to F - actin ( B ) Example of FRAP simulation images for the model with monomer as only diﬀuse species simulation Scale bar : 2 µ m ( C ) Recovery for the model with monomer as only diﬀuse species simulation front and back of lamellipodium where front is 0 - 0 . 5 µ m from the leading edge and back is 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 µ m [ 1 ] G ( x ) = G ∞ − D o D G O ( x ) − v r D G ∞ (cid:90) x F ( x (cid:48) ) dx (cid:48) , ( 1 . 12 ) where f ( x ) = a G ( x ) − v r ∂F ( x ) / ∂x [ 1 ] . The graphs of the steady state equations for the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events are shown in Figure 1 . 8 C - D . From these equations one can calculate the binding 20 rate of the the oligomers to F - actin , r O → F ( x ) = a o ( x ) O ( x ) . ( 1 . 13 ) This rate along with the rate for G - actin to F - actin are shown in Figure 1 . 10 A . FRAP simulations were done for the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events similar to those done for the model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species [ 1 ] . The steps for each particle at each time step are also similar to the previously described model except that one new species of particle is added . Instead of the F - actin becoming G - actin when the lifetime is up , the F - actin will now become O - actin when the lifetime is up . Then the O - actin can either bind to the network with a binding rate in Equation 1 . 13 or it can diﬀuse slowly with D = 0 . 5 µm 2 / s until its lifetime is up in which case it will become G - actin . An example of the FRAP simulation run with the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events is shown in Figure 1 . 10 B . The recovery curves are plotted in Figure 1 . 10 C . Compared to the model considering monomers as the only diﬀuse actin species , the model with both monomers and oligomers contributing to appearance events gives a better ﬁt to the experimental data . This is likely because the lag in recovery at the back of the lamellipodium is caused by oligomers rebinding locally to the F - actin network [ 1 ] . Another model by Lewalle et al . [ 15 ] models FRAP and photoactivation using a probabilistic model that has a set length scale of each factor such as incorporation and dissociation of the actin network as well as barbed and pointed ends and assumes that they are proportional . In the end all barbed , pointed , capped ends and junctions decay with the same length scale away from the leading edge . Their model includes distributed turnover , but no oligomers and assumes that the diﬀusion of G - actin is fast . In this model , the authors simulated FRAP and ﬁnd a good ﬁt from their theoretical model with their experimental FRAP [ 15 ] . Some previous models have been proposed to describe lamellipodial actin dy - namics similarly to Smith et al [ 1 ] ; however , they account only for polymerization 21 A B C Figure 1 . 10 : Recovery for model with monomers and oligomers as diﬀuse species ( A ) Re - action rates from both O and G - actin to F - actin ( B ) Example of FRAP simu - lation images for the model with monomers and oligomers as diﬀuse species simulation Scale bar : 2 µ m ( C ) Recovery for the model with monomers and oligomers as diﬀuse species simulation front and back of lamellipodium where front is 0 - 0 . 5 µ m from the leading edge and back is 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 µ m [ 1 ] of actin at the leading edge of the cell [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] . Others have utilized known reactions at the leading edge and include assembly and disassembly throughout the lamellipodium [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] . However , [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] do not model FRAP or utilize SiMS data in their models and simulations . Another study was done to model FLAP [ 24 ] ; however , this model did not include distributed turnover of actin throughout the leading edge [ 1 ] . 22 1 . 4 Outline for thesis In this thesis I will address the turnover of actin and regulators in three sections . First , I will discuss the diﬀusive dynamics of capping protein and the Arp2 / 3 complex in the lamellipodium by utilizing a reaction and diﬀusion model and implementing that with a 2D Monte Carlo particle simulation . It is also debated whether SiMS mi - croscopy data and FRAP data are compatible because they seemingly give opposing results ; we will show that these two techniques are compatible for these two proteins but highlight diﬀerent aspects of the dynamics of these proteins . It is estimated that approximately 50 % of diﬀuse capping protein in the lamellipodium is slowly diﬀusing [ 25 ] . We want to study implications of why the capping protein is slowly diﬀusing and suggest mechanisms that may be occurring . The possibilities are that either it is slowly diﬀusing while bound to an actin oligomer or it is bound to the membrane and diﬀusing slowly on the membrane of the cell . We compare model results that include each of these separately and suggest experiments to distinguish the two pos - sibilities . The Arp2 / 3 complex is also known to diﬀuse slowly [ 6 ] . The authors in [ 6 ] observe the Arp2 / 3 complex diﬀuses slowly on the membrane in a lateral fashion before incorporating into the actin network and undergoing retrograde ﬂow with the network . We make a model based on this observation and compare our model with FRAP experiments . Second , I will study actin dynamics within the lamellipodium while comparing to photoactivation experiments in Cath . a diﬀerentiated cells . In this study we are interested in explaining the enhancement of G - actin measured at the leading edge of these cells as well as ﬁnding if diﬀusion is suﬃciently fast for allowing ﬂuorescently tagged actin to arrive at the leading edge of these cells without active transport . We also study the eﬀect of Thymosin β 4 knockdown on actin turnover dynamics and kinetics . In order to do this we use a model that accounts for three separate diﬀuse pools of actin , each with diﬀerent kinetics , as well as one bound pool of actin . This model is implemented into a 2D Monte Carlo particle simulation that allows for simulation of both FRAP and photoactivation . 23 Third , our 2D simulation used in the previous 2 sections is limited in that it does not account for geometry of the cell or actin within the center of the cell , which is where a large portion of the actin resides within a cell . Similar models described above are used within the lamellipodium portion of the 3D simulated cell but are simply extended to 3D and written in polar coordinates . Medial actin is also added both in diﬀuse form as well as bound form . The bound actin within the cell center is assumed to be either in stress ﬁbers , non - stress ﬁbers , or cortical actin which are the main types of F - actin in the cell middle . These 3D simulations are used to compare to photoactivation experiments performed in [ 12 ] . We also want to address a debate within the ﬁeld if diﬀusion is fast enough for delivery of actin monomers to the leading edge of the cell or if active transport is needed [ 24 , 26 ] and ﬁnd if a portion of actin within the lamellipodium stays within the lamellipodium and does not diﬀuse into the cell center . The models included in this thesis are not complete models that include every regulator that could possibly aﬀect each protein . Instead each model is a part that intends to answer smaller questions with the end goal that at some point enough knowledge could be gathered to make a model that includes all regulators within a cell to understand all protein kinetics and how each protein aﬀects the others . 24 Chapter 2 Diﬀusive Dynamics of Capping Protein and Arp2 / 3 Complex in the Lamellipodium 2 . 1 Introduction As discussed in Chapter 1 , the lamellipodial protrusions at the leading edge of motile cells have been studied extensively , both due to their importance in cell motility and as model systems of cytoskeletal dynamics [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . In the lamel - lipodium , actin ﬁlaments form a dynamic network that polymerizes primarily close to the leading edge of the cell , with the ﬁlament barbed ends pointing toward the cell membrane . In the dendritic nucleation model , many of these ﬁlaments are created as branches oﬀ pre - existing ﬁlaments [ 4 ] . Filament capping by capping protein ( CP ) regulates the concentration of free ends . As ﬁlaments polymerize , the whole actin network undergoes retrograde ﬂow towards the cell center . The diﬀerence between the rates of polymerization and retrograde ﬂow results in net lamellipodial protru - sion or retraction . The actin subunits in the ﬁlament that move towards the back of the network break oﬀ from the ﬁlament network due to coﬁlin - induced severing into 25 oligomers . The disassembled pieces further depolymerize into monomers and are re - cycled close to the leading edge by diﬀusion . Since all lamellipodial components have to be recycled , the transport of disassembled proteins through the cytoplasm back towards the leading edge is an important component of the kinetics in lamellipodia . Some studies suggested that diﬀusion is fast enough to deliver actin subunits to the leading edge [ 13 , 12 ] while others have proposed a role for active transport mecha - nisms [ 24 , 26 ] . As discussed in chapter 1 , theoretical work has shown how diﬀusion may become limiting , depending on both the value of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the cytoplasm as well as the spatial distribution of sources and sinks of actin subunits in the cytoplasm [ 20 , 1 ] . One of the diﬃculties in directly measuring the existence of gradients of diﬀuse actin experimentally is that the diﬀuse population is a small fraction of the actin in ﬁlaments . Further , the dynamics in photoactivation or pho - tobleaching experiments reﬂect a combination of reaction and diﬀusion that can be hard to disentangle [ 1 , 32 ] . Recent studies have shown how mathematical models based on data obtained by single molecule speckle ( SiMS ) microscopy can be com - bined with ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) or photoactivation ( PA ) studies to model the dynamics of the diﬀuse actin pool [ 12 , 1 ] . In SiMS , cells contain ﬂuorescently labeled proteins at a concentration suﬃciently low to resolve single molecules [ 10 ] . If a ﬂuorescent protein is diﬀusing freely in the lamellipodium , it will appear as a diﬀuse background or localized cloud , depending on its diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the exposure time of the camera . When the tagged protein binds to the actin network it appears as a speckle undergoing retrograde ﬂow while it remains bound to the network . Speckle disappearance reﬂects dissociation of the tagged pro - tein to the diﬀuse pool . By contrast , cells in FRAP or PA experiments typically contain a large fraction of labeled protein that leads to spatially extended intensity ﬁelds , the redistribution of which around an area of interest reﬂects the dynamics of reaction , retrograde ﬂow , and diﬀusion [ 1 ] . The model of Smith et al . [ 1 ] used SiMS data as input to suggest that accounting for a population of slowly diﬀusing actin oligomers , the result of actin ﬁlament severing , allows for a better ﬁt of the 26 model to the FRAP data due to local release and rebinding to the actin ﬁlament network . Comparison of an extension of the Smith at el . model to photoactivation PA experiments further supported the existence of a recycling pool at the back of the lamellipodium together with a fast - diﬀusing pool that delivers subunits close to the leading edge at nearly the diﬀusion - controlled rate [ 12 ] . Capping protein and the Arp2 / 3 complex are two of the most important regulators of actin dynamics in cells and in in vitro reconstitution experiments [ 33 ] . This chapter extends the approach of Smith et al . to the study of the diﬀusive dynamics of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex for which both SiMS and FRAP data have been performed in lamellipodia ( albeit by diﬀerent groups on diﬀerent cell systems ) . Similar to the case of diﬀuse actin , it is possible that both exhibit signiﬁcant concentration gradients in their diﬀuse pool . For example , slowly - diﬀusing capping proteins have indeed been observed by SiMS [ 25 ] , which may reﬂect capping protein bound to slowly - diﬀusing actin oligomers or to the membrane . The Arp2 / 3 complex has also been observed to form a slowly - diﬀusing complex with its activators prior to attachment to the actin network [ 6 ] . However the implications of this observation on its turnover kinetics has not been modeled . In the following sections we ﬁrst introduce the general framework of our mathematical model with one bound species and two diﬀuse populations . We then proceed to apply it to capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics to derive concentration proﬁles across the lamellipodium at steady state . The focus through - out is on lamellipodia of stationary cells at steady state with steady retrograde ﬂow and no net protrusion and retraction . We discuss the implications of the calculated concentration gradients in the control of cell motility . 2 . 2 Methods 2 . 2 . 1 Calculating Steady State Proﬁles Since proteins in the lamellipodium are frequently associating to larger complexes or binding to the membrane , we consider the simplest model to account for this 27 behavior that has two distinct cytoplasmic populations . A fast diﬀusing cytoplasmic population , C fast , and a slow diﬀusing cytoplasmic population , C slow , are shown in the cartoon of the model in Figure 2 . 1 , which is an extension of the model used in Smith et al . [ 1 ] . Bound cytoplasmic protein , B , can depolymerize into either C fast with probability s 1 or C slow with probability s 2 , where s 2 = 1 − s 1 . The diﬀuse protein C fast can become bound protein with spatially dependent rate r C fast ( x ) , and C slow can become bound with spatially dependent rate r C slow ( x ) , where x is the distance from the leading edge . The diﬀuse component C fast can become C slow with a lifetime of τ Cfast , and the component C slow can become C fast with a lifetime of τ C slow . Figure 2 . 1 : Diﬀusion reaction model for actin binding proteins and protein complexes in lamellipodia . The three species are bound ( B ) , fast diﬀusing in the cytoplasm ( C fast ) , and slow diﬀusing in the cytoplasm ( C slow ) . The lifetimes of C fast and C slow respectively are τ C fast and τ C slow . The appearance rates a C fast ( x ) and a C slow ( x ) that depend on the distance to the leading edge x are deﬁned in Equations 2 . 2 and 2 . 3 and the detachment rate d ( x ) is deﬁned in Equation 2 . 8 . The parameter s 1 is the probability for the bound protein to dissociate into C fast and s 2 = 1 − s 1 . In SiMS microscopy ( Figure 2 . 2A ) , each speckle that appears is a ﬂuorescently tagged protein that becomes bound from the cytoplasmic pool . Where the speckle 28 appears with respect to distance from the leading edge is recorded and the appear - ances are then binned in a histogram . This appearance proﬁle , an example of which is shown in Figure 2 . 2B , is the sum of two separate appearance proﬁles , a C fast ( x ) and a C slow ( x ) , due to the fast and slow cytoplasmic pools as follows : a ( x ) = a C fast ( x ) + a C slow ( x ) . ( 2 . 1 ) The units of a ( x ) are µ M / s . While in some cases it is possible to use SiMS to monitor the diﬀusive state of the protein prior to becoming bound , how the proﬁle is split into two components can be an assumption of the model . Generally , the speckle appearance proﬁle can be ﬁtted by a double exponential with two length - scales λ short and λ long . We deﬁne C fast , ∞ and C slow , ∞ to be the concentrations of C fast and C slow respectively at distances far from the leading edge of the cell . Using C ∞ = C fast , ∞ + C slow , ∞ to normalize concentrations , the constant K deﬁnes the magnitude of the association reactions : a C fast ( x ) = KC ∞ (cid:16) A C fast 1 e − x / λ short + A C fast 2 e − x / λ long (cid:17) ( 2 . 2 ) a C slow ( x ) = KC ∞ (cid:16) A C slow 1 e − x / λ short + A C slow 2 e − x / λ long (cid:17) , ( 2 . 3 ) where the dimensionless coeﬃcients in Equations 2 . 2 and 2 . 3 satisfy A C fast 1 + A C fast 2 + A C slow 1 + A C slow 2 = 1 . SiMS microscopy also measures the lifetime distribution for protein speckles , p ( t ) that typically shows weak dependence upon distance from the leading edge , within a range of a few µ m [ 10 , 25 , 8 ] . In the examples we consider in this chapter , it is ﬁtted with a single exponential : p ( t ) = 1 / τ (cid:0) e − t / τ (cid:1) . ( 2 . 4 ) An example of a lifetime distribution is shown in Figure 2 . 2C for capping protein speckles . The bound protein proﬁle , B ( x ) , can be calculated analytically using the 29 A B C µ 5 µm 5 µm 500 ms per frame Figure 2 . 2 : Capping protein single molecule speckle microscopy data .

Data reproduced from [ 8 ] . function Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) , which gives the amount of bound protein at that came from x (cid:48) due to retrograde ﬂow , taking into account the lifetime distribution : Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) = Θ ( x − x (cid:48) ) 1 v r ∞ (cid:90) x − x (cid:48) vr p ( t ) dt . ( 2 . 5 ) The parameter v r is the retrograde ﬂow in the lamellipodium , and Θ is the step 30 function . Using Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) one can ﬁnd the proﬁle of bound protein B 1 ( x ) and B 2 ( x ) due to each of the diﬀuse species , C fast and C slow , respectively , such that B ( x ) = B 1 ( x ) + B 2 ( x ) , where : B 1 ( x ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) a C fast ( x (cid:48) ) dx (cid:48) ( 2 . 6 ) B 2 ( x ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 Y ( x , x (cid:48) ) a C slow ( x (cid:48) ) dx (cid:48) . ( 2 . 7 ) The steady state reaction diﬀusion equations that describe the system in Figure 2 . 1 are as follows : v r ∂B ( x ) ∂x = a ( x ) − d ( x ) ( 2 . 8 ) D C fast ∂ 2 C fast ∂x 2 = a C fast ( x ) − s 1 d ( x ) + 1 τ C fast C fast ( x ) − 1 τ C slow C slow ( x ) ( 2 . 9 ) D C slow ∂ 2 C slow ∂x 2 = a C slow ( x ) − ( 1 − s 1 ) d ( x ) + 1 τ C slow C slow ( x ) − 1 τ C fast C fast ( x ) . ( 2 . 10 ) Parameters D C fast and D C slow are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients for C fast and C slow re - spectively and d ( x ) is the detachment rate of bound proteins to the cytoplasm , which is found by solving Equation 2 . 8 , given a ( x ) and B ( x ) from Equations 2 . 1 , 2 . 6 , and 2 . 7 . Equation 2 . 8 is a transport equation that shows how retrograde ﬂow of B is balanced by the association and detachment . Equation 2 . 9 balances diﬀusion of C fast with association and detachment of the fast species and conversion between fast and slow diﬀusing states . The parameter s 1 is the probability for the bound protein to dissociate into C fast . Equation 2 . 10 is the same as Equation 2 . 9 except for the slowly diﬀusing species C slow . The concentrations far from the leading edge obey : C slow , ∞ / C fast , ∞ = τ C slow / τ C fast . Equations 2 . 1 - 2 . 10 can be solved numerically to ﬁnd C fast ( x ) / C fast , ∞ and C slow ( x ) / C slow , ∞ given v r , τ C fast , τ C slow , D C fast , D C slow , s 1 , and the parameters that deﬁne a C fast ( x ) , a C slow ( x ) , and p ( t ) . The method used involves adding time dependence to Equations 2 . 9 and 2 . 10 and allowing them to relax for a suﬃciently long time : ∂C fast ∂t = D C fast ∂ 2 C fast ∂x 2 − a C fast ( x ) + s 1 d ( x ) − 1 τ C fast C fast ( x ) + 1 τ C slow C slow ( x ) ( 2 . 11 ) 31 ∂C fast ∂t = D C slow ∂ 2 C slow ∂x 2 − a C slow ( x ) + ( 1 − s 1 ) d ( x ) − 1 τ C slow C slow ( x ) + 1 τ C fast C fast ( x ) . ( 2 . 12 ) We impose a no - ﬂux boundary condition at the leading edge : diﬀusion to the leading edge is balanced by the retrograde ﬂow taking the bound protein away from the leading edge . 2 . 2 . 2 Calculation of Rate Constants Based on Steady State Proﬁle and Monte Carlo Simulation The local rates with which the cytoplasmic protein binds to the network from the fast and slow diﬀusing states can be found using the appearance proﬁles and the cytoplasmic protein proﬁles calculated in the preceding subsection : r C fast = a C fast ( x ) C fast ( x ) ( 2 . 13 ) r C slow = a C slow ( x ) C slow ( x ) . ( 2 . 14 ) These are the reaction rates for C fast to convert into B 1 and for C slow into B 2 . We used the model in Figure 2 . 1 to create a 2D Monte Carlo simulation of independent particles in the lamellipodium by extending the method of Smith et al . [ 1 ] . The sim - ulation was initialized using the steady state concentrations evaluated by Equations 2 . 11 and 2 . 12 . At each simulation step that corresponds to time dt ( chosen to be suﬃciently small ) , the following processes occur : 1 . Each diﬀusing particle is displaced by a distance chosen from the 2D free diﬀusion propagator with the corresponding diﬀusion coeﬃcient . 2 . Particles in the bound state undergo movement by distance v r dt that corre - sponds to retrograde ﬂow . 3 . The rates in Equations 2 . 13 and 2 . 14 are used to choose whether or not a diﬀusing particle converts to the bound state . 32 4 . The lifetime of each particle that converts to the bound state is chosen from the SiMS distribution p ( t ) . 5 . Bound particles convert to the diﬀusing state when their lifetime has been reached . Parameter s 1 is used to determine the fraction of these particles that become fast or slowly diﬀusing . 6 . The fast and slow diﬀusing species convert between each other with proba - bilities chosen from exponential distributions with average lifetimes τ C fast and τ C slow , respectively . The side boundary conditions in our simulation are reﬂective . Any bound protein that exists at the back of the simulation box is converted into a diﬀusing protein and subsequently recycled . To model FRAP experiments , particles in a deﬁned region are deleted . Particles outside of the region are then able to move into the bleached region . Recovery curves can be thus measured and compared to experimental data . To model photoactivation PA experiments , particles outside of the photoactivated region are deleted and the particles are then able to diﬀuse and react in the manner described above . 2 . 3 Results 2 . 3 . 1 Application to Capping Protein Dynamics We ﬁrst apply the general model of Section 2 to capping protein , the lamellipodial dynamics of which have been studied in prior studies with both FRAP and SiMS , though in diﬀerent cell systems . Kapustina et al . [ 3 ] analyzed FRAP data of ﬁbrob - last cells expressing EGFP - CapZ in a circular region of diameter 5 µ m centered at 5 µ m from the leading edge of the cell [ 34 ] . They ﬁtted the recovery to a model that used Virtual Cell ( which is a computational tool used for modeling and simulations of cell biology ) with various components to ﬁnd values for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of capping protein in the cytoplasm , D = 5 - 10 µ m 2 / s , and for its lifetime when bound to the actin network , τ = 10 s . These values are diﬀerent to those measured with SiMS 33 microscopy of XTC cells [ 25 , 8 ] ( Figure 2 . 2A ) where capping protein was found to associate over an extended area of the lamellipodium ( Figure 2 . 2B ) but with a large slowly diﬀusing cytoplasmic pool with D ≈ 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s and to have a shorter bound lifetime , τ ≈ 2 s ( Figure 2 . 2C ) [ 25 , 8 ] . While both studies show a short lifetime of bound capping protein compared to the lifetime of polymerized actin that is 24 - 30 s in lamellipodia [ 10 , 25 ] , they indicate quantitatively diﬀerent transport modes in the lamellipodia . Our goal in this Section is ﬁnding out if the measured SiMS microscopy parameters from Miyoshi et al . can be used to ﬁt the FRAP data from Kapustina et al . and to study the implications for the concentration proﬁle of capping protein across the lamellipodia . Since the full model of Fig . 1 has many parameters in the subsequent section we consider two previously - proposed possibilities for the reasons behind slow capping protein diﬀusion : one being that capping protein is bound to severed actin oligomers , the other being that capping protein binds to the membrane . We use the SiMS data of Figure 2 . 2 to calculate rate constants for our Monte Carlo simulation . We then simulate bleaching of a 5 µ m by 5 µ m square region centered 5 µ m from the leading edge to compare to the data of Kapustina et al . using a circular bleach region ( this diﬀerence in shape has only a small eﬀect on the recovery curve ) . In the simulations for capping protein below we used a typical value for retrograde ﬂow , v r = 0 . 03 µ m / s [ 35 ] . Model including Oligomers We ﬁrst consider the model with oligomers shown in Figure 2 . 3A , B , a speciﬁc case of the general model ( Figure 2 . 1 ) . The motivation for this model is the suggested existence of short actin ﬁlaments ( actin oligomers ) in the lamellipodium , a result of coﬁlin - mediated severing [ 1 ] . If severed actin ﬁlaments are capped by capping protein , this could explain why 50 % of capping protein has been observed in a slowly diﬀusing state with diﬀusion coeﬃcient ≈ 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s [ 25 ] . In this model C fast represents capping protein heterodimers diﬀusing in the cytoplasm and C slow represents capping 34 protein heterodimers attached to the barbed end of an actin oligomer diﬀusing in the cytoplasm . The bound protein can only dissociate into capped oligomers , C slow , that can either rebind to the network or become uncapped and convert to C fast . We assume that both fast and slow diﬀusing species can bind to the network , rep - resenting capping of free barbed ends and re - binding of oligomers to the lamellipodial network , respectively . Since SiMS only measures the total appearance proﬁle a ( x ) ( Figure 2 . 2B ) , an additional assumption in our model is how a ( x ) is split into a C fast ( x ) and a C slow ( x ) . The authors of [ 1 ] suggested that oligomer rebinding contributes to a large fraction of actin speckle appearance at the back of the lamellipodium . We expect the behavior of capping protein to follow the behavior of actin oligomer re - binding . Since the total appearance proﬁle can be ﬁt to a double exponential ( Figure 2 . 2B ) , we assume that the appearance rates are broken up such that a C fast ( x ) corre - sponds to the short length scale and a C slow ( x ) to the long length scale : a C fast ( x ) = KC ∞ A 1 e − x / λ short ( 2 . 15 ) a C slow ( x ) = KC ∞ A 2 e − x / λ long , ( 2 . 16 ) with A 1 = 0 . 74 , A 2 = 0 . 26 , λ short = 2 . 0 µ m and λ long = 8 . 65 µ m ( see dotted and dashed line in Figure 2 . 2B ) . The proﬁle a C fast ( x ) accounts for the appearances due to C fast close to the leading edge , whereas the proﬁle a C slow ( x ) accounts for the ap - pearances due to C slow ( Figure 2 . 2 B ) that are more distributed throughout the lamellipodium . Several parameters in the model can be calculated from prior exper - iments or their range can be estimated . The lifetime distribution of capping protein bound to the network , p ( t ) ( Figure 2 . 2 C ) can be ﬁt with a single exponential where τ = 2 . 0 s [ 8 ] . The lifetime of the capping protein bound to the actin oligomer ( τ C slow ) is likely in the range of the lifetime of an actin oligomer , 5 - 30 seconds [ 1 ] . The diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the slow component is D C slow = 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s [ 25 ] and D C fast = 2 - 5 µ m 2 / s is expected , comparable to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of actin monomers [ 12 , 32 ] . Another important parameter , K , in the simulation controls the ratio of the concentration of bound protein to cytoplasmic protein .

The ending time of the experimental measurement ( 40 s ) is normalized to the value of the simulation at 40 s . The simulated recovery is normalized to one at long times . Simulations in panels C - F use K = 0 . 5 s − 1 , D C fast = 2 . 0 µ m 2 / s , D C slow = 0 . 2 µ m 2 / s , v r = 0 . 03 µ m / s , τ = 2 . 0 s , and τ C slow = 13 . 0 s , except for the labeled curve in F that has D C slow = 0 . 2 µ m 2 / s . 36 from the Watanabe lab from [ 25 ] and using SpeckleTrackerJ to count the number of speckles that correspond to bound protein and the number of diﬀusing proteins that appear as broadened speckle “clouds” [ 25 ] . The measured ratio of cytoplas - mic protein to bound protein was estimated to be 2 . 3 to 1 . Scanning the model parameters within the range described in the preceding paragraph allows us to run the simulation to obtain ﬁts to FRAP data . The simulated FRAP was applied to a steady state initialized with the concentrations found after relaxing Equations 2 . 11 and 2 . 12 in time . Figure 2 . 3C shows the steady state concentration proﬁles using K = 0 . 5 s − 1 , D C fast = 2 . 0 µ m 2 / s , D C slow = 0 . 2 µ m 2 / s , v r = 0 . 03 µ m / s , τ = 2 . 0 s and τ C slow = 13 . 0 s . With this value of K , the resulting proﬁle has a big fraction of slowly - diﬀusing capping proteins , consistent with our measured ratio of bound to diﬀuse species . The reaction rates for the simulation , as function of distance from the leading edge , found using the concentration proﬁle in Equations 2 . 11 and 2 . 12 , are shown in Figure 2 . 3D . The rate for C slow to bind to the network is very small compared to the rate for C fast to bind to the network ( even though appearances due to C slow account for a large fraction of appearance at the back of the lamellipodium , see Fig . 2B ) . In order to obtain good ﬁts to the experimental FRAP data for capping protein , the lifetime τ C slow needs to be maximized , and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D C fast needs to be minimized , within the range of values described above and the range that gives non - negative concentration proﬁles in the model equations . An example of simulated FRAP is shown in Figure 2 . 3E while Figure 2 . 3F shows the recovery of the intensity in the bleached region along with the recovery in Kapustina et al . The recovery curve for D C slow = 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s that uses the same parameters as Figure 2 . 3C is an overall good ﬁt to the experimental curve , however the initial recovery is more rapid compared to experiment . The ﬁt can be improved using D C slow = 0 . 2 µ m 2 / s ( and other parameters unchanged ) that gives a slightly slower initial recovery and ﬁts the experimental data more accurately . The above results show that parameters measured with SiMS can be used to model the FRAP data in [ 3 ] , using a smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient D C slow and faster dissociation time τ compared to the parameters 37 used in the ﬁt in [ 3 ] . The diﬀusion of long - lived oligomers out of the bleached region contributes to making the recovery slower initially and a value τ C slow ≈ 13 s is needed for a good ﬁt . This is in agreement with that fact that slowly - diﬀusing speckles can be tracked for a few seconds and thus the lifetime of the slowly - diﬀusing capping protein is likely in the range of 5 - 30 s [ 25 ] ( note : τ C slow cannot become much longer than a threshold above which the calculated C fast becomes negative ) . Even though the dissociation time τ = 2 s is small compared to the measured FRAP half - time , the bound species is a small fraction of the total amount . Model with Membrane Binding Another way of accounting for slowly diﬀusing capping protein is considering that capping protein binds and diﬀuses along the membrane [ 25 ] . Membrane binding can occur through a fast - diﬀusing state in the cytoplasm or by membrane - induced uncapping of capped barbed ends . The model shown in Figure 2 . 4A , B is another possible mechanism of why capping protein dissociates so frequently from the actin network and diﬀuses slowly . CARMIL is a membrane bound protein complex that also binds capping protein and may account for the very short lifetime of capping protein bound to the actin ﬁlament [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] . In this model only fast diﬀusing cytoplasmic protein is able to become bound ( representing capping of barbed ends ) so that the appearance rate is : a ( x ) = a C fast ( x ) = KC ∞ (cid:0) A 1 e − x / λ short + A 2 e − x / λ long (cid:1) ( 2 . 17 ) with A 1 = 0 . 74 , A 2 = 0 . 26 , λ short = 2 . 0 µ m , and λ long = 8 . 65 µ m . The bound protein can dissociate into either C fast or C slow and the parameter s 1 is the probability of dissociating into C fast . The fast diﬀusing capping protein can convert to slow with lifetime τ C fast and slow can become fast with lifetime τ C slow . The model in Figure 2 . 4A , B is another speciﬁc case of the general model ( Figure 2 . 1 ) . The model with membrane binding ( Figure 2 . 4 ) has more parameters compared to the model with oligomers ( Figure 2 . 3 ) .

The ending time of the experimental measurement ( 40 s ) is normalized to the value of the sim - ulation at 40 s . The simulated recovery is normalized to one at long times . Simulations in panels C - F use K = 0 . 435 s − 1 , D C fast = 2 . 0 µ m 2 / s , D C slow = 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s , v r = 0 . 03 µ m / s , τ = 2 . 0 s , τ C fast = 5 . 0 s , τ C slow = 5 . 0 s , s 1 = 0 . 1 , except for the labeled curve in F that has D C slow = 0 . 1 µ m 2 / s . 39 D C fast , D C slow , τ , v r , and K . The new parameters are the lifetimes τ C fast , τ C slow , and the dissociation probability s 1 . As mentioned in 3 . 1 . 1 , the lifetime of the slowly - diﬀusing capping protein is likely in the range of 5 - 30 s . We start by assuming that τ C fast = τ C slow so that C fast and C slow each correspond to 50 % of the concentration far from the leading edge [ 25 ] . A concentration proﬁle similar to Figure 2 . 3C can be generated with K = 0 . 435 s − 1 , D C fast = 2 . 0 µ m 2 / s , D C slow = 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s , v r = 0 . 03 µ m / s , τ = 2 . 0 s , τ C fast = 5 . 0 s , τ C slow = 5 . 0 s , s 1 = 0 . 1 . These parameters give the reaction rate as a function of distance from the leading edge shown in Figure 2 . 4D for binding to the network from C fast , which is the only reaction rate to the bound state . We ﬁnd that we are able to ﬁt the experimental FRAP data using parameters consistent with SiMS data . The simulated recovery for the parameters of Figure 2 . 4C is shown in a montage in Figure 2 . 4E and the corresponding recovery curves are shown in Figure 2 . 4F , along with the experimental data . Both simulated curves with D C slow = 0 . 1 µ m 2 / s and D C slow = 0 . 5 µ m 2 / s ﬁt the data ; however the smaller diﬀusion coeﬃcient allows for a better ﬁt . Similar to the model with oligomers , D C fast needs to be on the lower range of the physically plausible values 2 - 5 µ m 2 / s ( in Figure 2 . 4C , further lowering of D C fast also makes the calculated steady state concentration proﬁle of C fast negative ) . Parameter s 1 needs to be small compared to unity , otherwise the bleached region recovers too quickly and none of the other parameters are able to slow the recovery down enough to capture what occurs in the experiment ( see Figure 2 . 5 ) . Keeping τ C fast = τ C slow , we varied these two parameters together and ﬁnd that they also need to be in the range of a few seconds ( see Figure 2 . 5 ) . In conclusion , obtaining a good ﬁt drives this model to a similar kinetic scheme as the model with oligomers , with the majority of the bound protein dissociating into slowly diﬀusing protein . However the lifetime of the slowly - diﬀusing species can be smaller than in the model with oligomers as slow diﬀusing capping protein can be generated by both uncapping and conversion from the fast species . 40 Figure 2 . 5 : Dependence of capping protein simulated FRAP on parameter values in the model with membrane binding . The bleached region is the same as in Figure 2 . 4 E . Left : Smaller values of the probability s 1 for bound capping protein to dissociate into the fast diﬀusing cytoplasmic pool give a slower recovery . Right : Larger values of the lifetime τ = τ C fast = τ C slow give a slower recovery . Unless otherwise indicated , the parameter values used are K = 0 . 435 s − 1 , D C fast = 2 . 0 µ m 2 / s , v r = 0 . 03 µ m / s , τ = 2 . 0 s , s 1 = 0 . 1 and τ = τ C fast = τ C slow = 5 . 0 s . Comparison of Two Models for Capping Protein Turnover Both models of Fig . 3 and 4 work to ﬁt the FRAP results from Kapustina et al . [ 3 ] using parameters from the SiMS microscopy data of Miyoshi et al . [ 8 ] . The pool of slowly diﬀusing protein is important to ﬁt FRAP recovery with half - time on the order of 10 s , using a bound lifetime of 2 s . Retrograde ﬂow contributes little to FRAP since the distance traveled by retrograde ﬂow during recovery is small compared to the size of the bleached region . Since both models are driven to similar kinetic transition rates , it is hard to distinguish between them using further FRAP data of either the back or front of the lamellipodium ( see Supplementary Figure 2 . 6 ) . A clearer diﬀerence between the two models can be seen in lamellipodium photoactivation simulations with the same parameters as for the FRAP data . There is more rebinding throughout the lamellipodium directly after photoactivation from 41 the model with oligomers as throughout the lamellipodium compared to the model with membrane binding . This reﬂects the assumption of oligomer re - association with the actin network at the back of the lamellipodium . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CP Front Comparison Membrane Model With Oligomers Model N o r m a li z ed I n t en s i t y time ( s ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CP Middle Comparison Membrane Model With Oligomers Model N o r m a li z ed I n t en s i t y time ( s ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CP Back Comparison Membrane Model With Oligomers Model N o r m a li z ed I n t en s i t y time ( s ) Model with Oligomers Model with Membrane Binding Model with Oligomers Model with Membrane Binding Model with Oligomers Model with Membrane Binding Figure 2 . 6 : Comparison of simulated FRAP for the two capping protein models of Fig - ures 2 . 3 and 2 . 4 . The bleached region is a square box with one side of length 5 µ m along the cell membrane and depth 5 µ m into the cell . Left : At 0 - 1 µ m from the leading edge the recovery in the model with membrane binding is somewhat faster . Middle : At 2 - 3 µ m from the leading edge the recovery in the model with membrane binding is faster although the diﬀerence is not as large as at the leading edge . Right : At the back of the bleached region 4 - 5 µ m away from the leading edge , the results of the two models are indis - tinguishable . For all panels , same constants are used as in Figures 2 . 3 and 2 . 4 . Interestingly , both models demonstrate signiﬁcant concentration gradients of the two diﬀuse species across the lamellipodium ( Figures 3C and 4C ) . The origin of this gradient is mainly the local production of slowly diﬀusing capping protein close to the leading edge . The inward ﬂux of the slowly - diﬀusing population plus the retrograde ﬂow of the bound species must be balanced by the diﬀusive ﬂux of the fast species at steady state . The free energy source to maintain this non - equilibrium gradient must be sought in ATP hydrolysis , the free energy of which drives actin polymerization : in both models the actin network “pumps” fast - diﬀusing capping protein bound to it into the slowly - diﬀusing pool . 42 2 . 3 . 2 Application to Arp2 / 3 Complex Dynamics Both FRAP and SiMS microscopy experiments have been performed to study the kinetics of Arp2 / 3 complex in the lamellipodium . Figure 2 . 7A shows FRAP of the p16 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex by Lai et al . [ 2 ] . The bleached region is a 2 µ m by 4 µ m box positioned at the leading edge of a B16 - F1 melanoma cell . Recovery is faster at the leading edge of the cell than it is away from the leading edge . While this has been interpreted to suggest that Arp2 / 3 complex forms branches within a very narrow region close to the leading edge , SiMS experiments using XTC cells ( tagging the p40 and p21 subunits ) by Miyoshi et al . [ 8 ] show distributed speckle appearances 1 µ m away from the leading edge and further ( Figure 2 . 7B ) and an exponential distribution of speckle lifetimes with τ = 18 s ( Figure 2 . 7C ) . Our aim is to ( i ) use modeling to check if the FRAP recovery observed in Figure 2 . 7A is consistent with the distributed appearances in Figure 2 . 7B , and ( ii ) explore the implications for the concentration proﬁles of the diﬀuse species . Smith et al . [ 1 ] showed that distributed turnover of EGFP - actin can give faster FRAP at the cell front as compared to the cell back , however this has not been addressed for the Arp2 / 3 complex . In the simulations below we used a proﬁle with distributed appearances that is narrower compared to the proﬁle measured in XTC cells , which have wider lamel - lipodia compared to the B16 - F1 melanoma cells . This appearance proﬁle , shown in Figure 2 . 7B , was calculated to give an Arp2 / 3 complex concentration proﬁle that matches the concentration proﬁle of the B16 - F1 melanoma cells . This was done by measuring the intensity proﬁle in Figure 2 . 7A in excess of the cytoplasmic back - ground , assuming that this proﬁle is approximately proportional to the bound proﬁle B ( x ) , and using a ( x ) = B ( x ) / τ + v r dB ( x ) / dx that can be derived from Equations ( 2 - 7 ) . We use the speckle lifetime τ of Miyoshi et al . [ 8 ] , which is the only available lifetime measurement in live cells . The calculated a ( x ) proﬁle was ﬁt to a double exponential and the resulting curve is shown in Figure 2 . 7B . The diﬀerence between the calculated appearance proﬁle in Figure 2 . 7B and the data by Miyoshi et al . is ev - ident further than 1 µ m away from the leading edge where the calculated appearance 43 B C A 2 m Figure 2 . 7 : Summary of Arp2 / 3 complex FRAP and SiMS data .

( C ) . Arp2 / 3 complex speckle lifetime distribution from [ 8 ] . distribution approaches zero . In the following two sections we consider two diﬀerent models to explain for the dynamics of the Arp2 / 3 complex : a model with a diﬀuse pool with a single diﬀusion coeﬃcient and a model with fast and slow diﬀusing pools . Model with a Single Arp2 / 3 Complex Diﬀuse Cytoplasmic Pool The simplest model of Arp2 / 3 turnover involves a single diﬀusing species , C ( Figure 2 . 8A , B ) . Diﬀuse Arp2 / 3 complex can bind to the actin network to become bound protein B with the appearance rate a ( x ) . The appearance proﬁle for the Arp2 / 3 44 complex is given by a ( x ) = A 1 e − x / λ short + A 2 e − x / λ long . ( 2 . 18 ) with A 1 = 0 . 49 , A 2 = 0 . 51 , λ short = 0 . 08 µ m , and λ long = 0 . 43 µ m ( Figure 2 . 7 ) . The bound protein can dissociate into the diﬀuse species with the detachment rate d ( x ) corresponding to bound lifetime τ . This lifetime may include Arp2 / 3 complex attachment without branch formation , as observed in single molecule in vitro exper - iments where bound Arp2 / 3 complex has bound lifetimes in the range 2 - 200 s [ 39 ] . The estimated value of retrograde ﬂow in Figure 2 . 7A is v r = 0 . 04 µ m / s . Given the above parameters , the only two other parameters for the model are the cytoplasmic diﬀusion coeﬃcient , D C , and K , which adjusts the ratio of bound to cytoplasmic protein . Knowing the larger size of the Arp2 / 3 complex as compared to G - actin or capping protein , we anticipate a diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 2 - 6 µ m 2 / s . In the steady state proﬁle shown in Figure 2 . 8C , K = 5 s − 1 and D C = 4 . 0 µ m 2 / s . This proﬁle matches the experimental proﬁle taken by a line scan in Figure 2 . 7A , as expected since the appearance proﬁle was calculated using the experimental intensity proﬁle . A small relative depletion is observed in the cytoplasmic proﬁle near the leading edge because the diﬀusive ﬂow of the cytoplasmic pool towards the leading edge balances the outward retrograde ﬂow of the bound species . The parameters used for Figure 2 . 8C give the binding rate of cytoplasmic protein to bound protein as function of distance across the lamellipodium shown in Figure 2 . 8D . We used the model to ﬁt the experimental FRAP data by Lai et al . [ 2 ] , which shows faster recovery at the lamellipodium front as compared to the back ( Figure 2 . 7A ) . An example of simulated FRAP is shown in Figure 2 . 8E ( using the same parameters as in Figure 2 . 8C , D ) . The recovery is quantiﬁed in Figure 2 . 8F where the front recovery curve is taken 0 - 1 µ m from the leading edge , and the back recovery curve is taken 1 - 2 µ m from the leading edge as in Lai et al . [ 2 ] . Having a value for D C in the higher range described above aids in obtaining a good ﬁt of the recovery at the front ( smaller values results in somewhat slower recovery , see Figure 2 . 9 A - C ) .

This slower recovery is driven by binding at the back of the lamellipodium and retrograde ﬂow that brings labelled subunits from the cell front . The fact that the model results capture the shape of the recovery at the back relies on having a cytoplasmic to bound ratio much smaller than unity , which is tuned by parameter K ( larger values of this ratio correspond to larger K ) . Smaller values of K lead to a larger fraction of the fast initial recovery at the back and less agreement with the data ( see Figure 2 . 9 D - G ) . We note that the values of D C and K have to be above a threshold that depends on the value of the other such that the solution of the partial diﬀerential Equations 2 . 8 - 2 . 10 is non - negative . Model with Membrane Binding of the Arp2 / 3 Complex Using SiMS microscopy , Millius et al . [ 6 ] suggested that some Arp2 / 3 complexes bind to the WAVE complex on the cell membrane of XTC cells and perform a slow diﬀusion prior to incorporation of the actin network while other Arp2 / 3 complexes are recruited directly from the cytosol . Millius et al . observed slowly diﬀusing speckles of Arp2 / 3 complex components within a few µ m from the leading edge . We thus considered a model with membrane binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2 . 10 A , B ) . The two diﬀuse species in this model represent Arp2 / 3 complex in the cytoplasm , C fast , and bound to the membrane , C slow . The bound Arp2 / 3 complex dissociates into C fast only , representing debranching and dissociation of the Arp2 / 3 complex from the pointed end . This occurs with the detachment rate d ( x ) corresponding to bound lifetime τ , as in the model with a single diﬀuse species . We assume that binding to the membrane occurs close to the leading edge with a spatially dependent rate k ( x ) = k m e − x / λ m deﬁned by parameters λ m and k m . This was achieved in the simulations by using a spatially - dependent τ C fast in equations 2 . 9 and 2 . 10 and in the Monte Carlo model accordingly . Spontaneous unbinding occurs with lifetime τ C slow . The appearance proﬁle describing association of membrane - bound Arp2 / 3 complex to the actin network is the same as in equation 2 . 18 of the model with a single diﬀuse species .

Unless otherwise indicated , the reference values in all panels are D C = 4 . 0 µ m 2 / s , K = 5 s − 1 and v r = 0 . 04 µ m / s . The bleached region is the same as in Figure 2 . 8E . = 0 . 6 µ m 2 / s ( the estimate in Millius et al . [ 6 ] ) and assuming membrane binding occurs close to the leading edge , λ m = 0 . 2 µ m , leaves D C fast , K , τ C slow , and k m as undetermined parameters . In the steady state proﬁle in Figure 2 . 10C we use D C fast = 3 . 0 µ m 2 / s , K = 6 . 0 s − 1 , τ C slow = 20 s , and k m = 40 s − 1 . With these parameters , the bound protein is sharply peaked close to the leading edge while the fast diﬀusing protein is small compared to the bound proﬁle species and slightly depleted at the leading edge . The depletion reﬂects the diﬀusive ﬂow towards the leading edge that balances the retrograde ﬂow and diﬀusive ﬂow of the slow species away from the 48 lamellipodium . The slowly diﬀusing protein is also much smaller than the bound concentration at the leading edge ; however it is enhanced close to the leading edge . The parameters used in Figure 2 . 10C lead to the binding rate of the slowly diﬀusing to bound species as function of distance shown in Figure 2 . 10D . The simulated FRAP snapshots using the same parameters as in the concentration proﬁle of Figure 2 . 10C are shown in Figure 2 . 10E . The recovery curves compare well to experiment ( Figure 2 . 10F ) . The back recovery curve , which is sampled 1 - 2 µ m away from the leading edge , gives a better ﬁt in this model than in the previous model forwith a single diﬀuse pool the Arp2 / 3 complex . This is accounted for by the small amount of slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex that gives a slower recovery away from the leading edge . We found that in order to ﬁt the experimental FRAP data by Lai et al . [ 2 ] the value of K has to be suﬃciently high to keep the bound to cytoplasmic ratio suﬃciently smaller than unity ; otherwise the back of the lamellipodium recovers faster than in experiments ( see Figure 2 . 11 A - C ) . Similarly , decreasing the coeﬃcient k m to a value where the concentration of slowly - diﬀusing species becomes a small fraction of the bound concentration gives a better ﬁt to the FRAP curve at the back ( Figure 2 . 11 D - G ) . The recovery is also aﬀected by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the fast diﬀusing species . Values above D C fast = 2 . 0 µ m 2 / s give a good ﬁt to the experimental FRAP data . Compared to the model of section 3 . 2 . 1 , smaller D C fast values can now provide comparable ﬁts since the introduction of a membrane diﬀusing species also aids in the fast recovery . Comparison of two models for Arp2 / 3 Complex Turnover Both models can ﬁt the FRAP data from Lai et al . [ 2 ] using SiMS parameters from Miyoshi et al . [ 8 ] reasonably well . In these models a free energy source such as ATP hydrolysis on actin or Arp2 / 3 complex would be needed to establish the rates that maintain a steady state with concentration gradients of the diﬀuse species .

The larger values of k m give a smaller lag between the front and the back of the recovery because of the larger contribution of the diﬀusive species to the recovery at short times . Unless otherwise indicated , the reference values in all panels are D C fast = 3 . 0 µ m 2 / s , K = 2 . 0 s − 1 , τ C slow = 20 s , v r = 0 . 04 µ m / s , λ m = 0 . 2 µ m , and k m = 40 s − 1 . The bleached region is the same as in Figure 2 . 10E . consistent with ﬁndings from Millius et al . [ 6 ] than the model without a slow diﬀusing species . However both models with one diﬀuse species and two diﬀuse species require that the diﬀusing population is a small fraction of the bound . The fact that the concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex increases by about 8 - fold after stimulation in XTC cells [ 40 ] is consistent with the existence of a small fraction of fast - diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex ( presumably the only species present prior to lamellipodia stimulation ) . Inspection of the movies in Millius et al . [ 6 ] indicates however that the number of 51 slowly - diﬀusing speckles is comparable to the bound population . While the slowly - diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex speckles may also represent Arp2 / 3 complex bound to debranched actin oligomers ( not considered here as a separate species , for simplicity ) , such a pool would also need to be as small for the model to reproduce the FRAP data . It is possible that the diﬀerence may be due to the diﬀerent cell types : for example , we assumed that the lifetime distribution for the bound Arp2 / 3 complex is the same in NIH - 3T3 cells as in the XTC cells ( that have wider lamellipodia but the only cell type in which single molecule lifetime measurements exist ) . Similar to the case of capping protein , we found that the behavior after photoactivation may be used to compare the two models . When using parameters as in Figures 6 and 7 , in the model with membrane binding there is more local rebinding than in the model with a single cytoplasmic diﬀuse species . The single cytoplasmic diﬀuse species model also has faster spreading and binding at the leading edge further away from the photoactivated region . Future measurements of this type would be a useful way to further constrain possible Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics in the lamellipodium . 2 . 4 Discussion In this chapter we used modeling to calculate concentration proﬁles of capping protein ( Figures 2 . 3C and 2 . 4C ) and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 2 . 8C and 2 . 10C ) based on prior SiMS and FRAP data . In these proﬁles the cytoplasmic pool is modeled with either one or two types of diﬀuse populations ( “fast” and “slow” ) . This limit of two pools is a simplifying approximation that is helpful to examine transport limitations across the lamellipodium . Our model can be extended to cover additional diﬀuse pools to account for protein complexes with a distribution of diﬀusion coeﬃcients . The gradients in the diﬀuse pool will have implications on the behavior of the lamellipodium when perturbed from steady state , for example during the stimulation of a protrusion by increase of free barbed end concentration close to the leading edge [ 40 , 41 ] . In the model with capping proteins bound to oligomers ( Figure 2 . 3C ) , such 52 a sudden increase will not be accompanied by a proportional increase in the capping rate as the system is close to the diﬀusion rate of “fast” capping protein towards the leading edge . Since the slowly - diﬀusing capping proteins , assumed to be capped oligomers are produced by the bound species , such a local increase in barbed end concentration would lead to an increase in the concentration of the “slow” diﬀuse pool . In this model , the slow capping protein will bind to the back of the lamel - lipodium with an increased overall rate , which could be part of a mechanism of structural remodeling in the lamellipodium during protrusion [ 8 ] . In the correspond - ing case in the model with membrane binding ( Figure 2 . 4C ) , the response would be similar but in that model the slow membrane - bound pool does not associate with the network and it would just accumulate and dissociate to the cytoplasm . Further , the diﬀuse pool gradients of both models rely on the continuous production of slow capping protein ; tuning of this rate by cells ( through severing or uncapping [ 36 ] ) may remove or enhance the diﬀusion limitations and thus act as part of a control mech - anism . The slow population of the capping protein near the leading edge may also act as a buﬀer of capping protein close to the leading edge but we note that we did not consider capping protein association to barbed ends through the slowly - diﬀusing membrane - bound capping protein pool . Diﬀusion limitations of the Arp2 / 3 complex towards the leading edge could be - come important upon protrusion initiation ( see concentration gradients of C fast in Figures 6C and 7C ) . In addition to enhancing the rate of Arp2 / 3 complex associa - tion to the actin ﬁlaments through a 2D diﬀusive search [ 6 ] , the slowly - diﬀusing pool could also act as a buﬀer of Arp2 / 3 complex for the faster response of active lamel - lipodia . The smallness of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 0 . 6 µ m 2 / s ) is important for keeping it close to the leading edge . Further SiMS and FRAP or pho - toactivation PA studies of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex under non - steady state conditions should help resolve some of these mechanisms . Photoactivation experiments can give a clear picture of where binding and un - binding occurs , complimentary to FRAP . Modeling and PA experiments using labeled 53 actin provided further support for two separate pools of actin [ 12 ] : ( i ) a pool coming from the center of the cell and bound to thymosin β 4 that targets polymerization at the leading edge of the cell , and ( ii ) a second pool that is recycling actin at the back of the lamellipodium . The model in [ 12 ] included two diﬀuse actin cytoplasmic pools and one membrane bound in complex with thymosin β 4 in order to account for the enhanced diﬀuse actin concentration close to the leading edge of neuroblastoma cells , similar to the models with membrane binding in the current work . Evidence for incorporation of diﬀuse actin to the lamellipodia network through - out the lamellipodium has also been provided by the FRAP and PA experiments of labeled actin by Lewalle et al . [ 15 ] . These authors also performed FRAP of Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia and found recovery throughout the lamellipodia pronounced close to the leading edge , consistent with the assumptions in our work . This study describes the distributed turnover of actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and capping protein as a system with a unique length - scale [ 15 ] . Other studies using ﬂuorescence speckle microscopy however suggest diﬀerent length scales for each component with capping protein , Arp2 / 3 complex , and F - actin having increasingly broader concentration pro - ﬁles [ 42 ] . In the results of this our work the capping protein distribution is broader than that of Arp2 / 3 complex but both are narrower than F - actin . Future work should examine if these diﬀerences are cell - type speciﬁc . Here we focused on the FRAP experiments by Lai et al . [ 2 ] because the width of the Arp2 / 3 complex distri - bution in [ 15 ] was narrower . We also used SiMS data rather than data for capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex from ﬂuorescent speckle microscopy on Drosophila S2 cells [ 42 ] where each speckle is a group of molecules rather than single molecules . Some prior mathematical models have studied aspects that relate to the kinetics of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex across the lamellipodium . The model by Ditlev et al . [ 22 ] that includes many known reactions that occur within the lamellipodium was used by Kapustina et al . [ 3 ] to model FRAP experiments , as described in section 3 . 1 . However its predictions on Arp2 / 3 complex turnover have not been explored . Huber et al . [ 21 ] and Stuhrmann et al . [ 23 ] developed computational and 54 mathematical models that account for actin monomer diﬀusion and actin ﬁlament severing and annealing throughout the lamellipodium but not accounting for diﬀusion of ﬁlaments after severing . Branch nucleation was assumed to occur only close to the leading edge and the barbed end capping rate was assumed uniform . They assumed that any severed ﬁlament that has an Arp2 / 3 complex bound to it does not anneal to another ﬁlament since it is treated as a minus - end capper . Slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex bound to actin oligomers may represent a third cytoplasmic pool , in addition to the other two pools of Figure 2 . 10A . We did not include such a third pool in order to focus on the mechanism for slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex proposed by Millius et al . [ 6 ] . Hu and Papoian [ 43 , 44 ] use a stochastic simulation model that includes physical and chemical interactions for actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and capping protein in the lamellipodium to model protrusions . They only allow Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated activation branching very close to the membrane , similar to Huber et al . and Stuhrmann et al . but in addition account for cytoplasmic diﬀusion with diﬀusion coeﬃcient 20 mu m 2 / s for all species . This reference value is larger than what we used here for the fast and slow diﬀusing pools . One of the ﬁndings in Hu and Papoian is a signiﬁcant dependence of protrusion dynamics on the concentrations of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex . Since cytoplasmic concentration gradients result for slower values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients , this eﬀect would provide an additional inﬂuence on protrusion dynamics . We conclude with a discussion of the diﬀusive dynamics of some other lamel - lipodia regulators that have been studied with SiMS , for which our analysis may be applicable in the future . Tsuji et al . [ 45 ] studied coﬁlin and AIP1 , which collaborate in actin ﬁlament severing [ 46 , 47 ] . These SiMS studies , as well as FRAP studies of coﬁlin [ 2 ] , indicate short bound lifetimes on the order of seconds and a broad ap - pearance proﬁle across the lamellipodium . Coﬁlin and AIP1 may be bound to the piece of severed ﬁlament after detachment for the network , which can be included in the model as a slowly diﬀusing cytoplasmic pool . Depending on the fraction of bound to diﬀuse protein , the FRAP curve for both proteins may be similar to that of 55 capping protein . VASP is another important regulator that typically localizes close to the leading edge of the cell as well as in focal adhesions [ 8 , 48 ] . SiMS data show very transient associations with the actin network [ 8 ] and FRAP of VASP at the leading edge of lamellipodia has a half time of 8 . 4 s [ 49 ] . VASP can form tetramers so future work could explore the role of the anticipated slowing down of cytoplasmic diﬀusion on these kinetics . The WAVE complex is another interesting protein to study as it is involved in the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The FRAP recovery of WAVE2 close to the leading edge has a half - time of 8 . 6 s [ 2 ] . SiMS shows a broad distribution of WAVE2 appearance events and lifetimes [ 6 ] . Only a small fraction of WAVE complex speckles undergo retrograde ﬂow compared to the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 20 % compared to 90 % ) [ 6 ] . Extensions of our model can be used to study the implications of slow WAVE2 diﬀusion with 0 . 41 µ m 2 / s [ 6 ] . 56 Chapter 3 Model with Two Pools of Actin Supply Leading Edge while Thymosin β 4 Aids in Fast Diﬀusion of Actin to the Leading Edge 3 . 1 Modeling PA - GFP - actin dynamics In 2013 we met experimentalist Eric Vitriol at an annual American Society for Cell Biology meeting , and we started a collaboration with him while he was a post doctoral researcher at Emory University under Professor James Zheng . It was observed in [ 50 ] that there is an enhancement of G - actin at the leading edge of neuronal CAD ( Cath . a diﬀerentiated ) cells . We wanted to see ( 1 ) if it was possible to explain this enhancement of G - actin at the leading edge of motile cells with a model and ( 2 ) to study the eﬀect of Thymosin β 4 knockdown ( KD ) ( Knockdown of a protein is when that protein is suppressed and the cell is not allowed to produce 57 as much of that protein as it normally would ) on actin kinetics and ( 3 ) to test if there are two pools of actin that contribute to the kinetics of the lamellipodium . Another important subject that we want to study is whether diﬀusion is fast enough to deliver actin to the leading edge of the cell . In order to do this we developed a computational model to describe actin turnover in lamellipodia that includes F - actin and three pools of actin in the cytoplasm or bound to the cell membrane [ 12 ] . A B Figure 3 . 1 : Enhancement of G - actin at leading edge of CAD cells from Vitriol et al . A ) CAD cells with GFP - actin and Lifeact ﬂuorescing which shows both G and F - actin and F - actin respectively . Scale bar 10 µ m . B ) Concentrations of actin as a function of distance from the leading edge in CAD cells . [ 50 ] The enhancement at the leading edge of CAD cells is seen in Figure 3 . 1 A and B . EGFP - actin tags both G - actin and F - actin whereas Lifeact - mRuby tags only the sides of F - actin . So the ratio of these two signals as a function of the distance from the leading edge shows the G - actin enhancement near the leading edge [ 50 ] . This can be seen in Figure 3 . 1 A at the bottom right and in Figure 3 . 1 B in the black curve . 58 3 . 2 Model description Our model is an extension of Smith et al . [ 1 ] which includes 3 pools of diﬀuse protein instead of 2 . The three pools are : R , which is a recycling component that represents all actin which has been recently depolymerized ( we do not make assumptions about the nature of the recycled actin , which may include oligomers or actin bound to other protein complexes ) ; G C , which binds reversibly to T β 4 in the cytoplasm ; and G M , which binds reversibly to the membrane in complex with other proteins which we do not make assumptions about in this model . G C and G M include actin monomers in complex with proﬁlin . This model is shown in Figure 3 . 2 A . [ 12 ] Figure 3 . 2 : A ) Diagram for model with Membrane binding protein B ) Steady state con - centration proﬁles normalized to G C far from the leading edge for control case . The rate of diﬀuse to bound , a ( x ) , is measured in µ M / s and taken from the appearance rate from SiMS data . The appearance rate in this model is split between the three actin pools , a ( x ) = a R ( x ) + a C ( x ) + a M ( x ) . ( 3 . 1 ) The appearance rate from SiMS data is ﬁt with a double exponential with length 59 scales λ 1 and λ 2 , where λ 1 < λ 2 . The appearances are deﬁned as follows : a C ( x ) = KG ∞ A C e − x / λ 1 , a M ( x ) = KG ∞ A M e − x / λ 1 , a R ( x ) = KG ∞ A R e − x / λ 2 ( 3 . 2 ) Here G ∞ is the concentration of G C far from the leading edge , K is a constant that determines the fraction of F to G - actin , and we deﬁne A C + A M + A R = 1 . Lifetimes for F - actin are given by the equation p ( t ) which gives the probability , given a time t , that the F - actin is still in the F - actin state which is represented by a double exponential as in [ 1 ] , p ( t ) / p ( 0 ) = C 1 e − t / τ 1 + C 2 e − t / τ 2 ( 3 . 3 ) where C 1 = 0 . 741 , C 2 = 0 . 259 , τ 1 = 16 s , and τ 2 = 60 s . The concentration of actin at steady state , F ( x ) , can be calculated from the polymerization rates and lifetime distribution as described in [ 1 ] . The equations that describe the steady state concentrations of the diﬀuse components are as follows : D R d 2 R ( x ) dx 2 = a R ( x ) + 1 τ R R ( x ) − d ( x ) , ( 3 . 4 ) D C d 2 G C ( x ) dx 2 = a C ( x ) + k ( x ) G C ( x ) − 1 τ GM G M ( x ) − 1 τ R R ( x ) , ( 3 . 5 ) D M D 2 G M ( x ) dx 2 = a M ( x ) − k ( x ) G C ( x ) + 1 τ GM G M ( x ) . ( 3 . 6 ) In these equations D R , D C , and D M are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients for recycled actin , cytoplasmic actin , and membrane bound actin respectively . The lifetimes τ GM and τ R are the times that G M and R remain in their respective states until they become G C . The rate k ( x ) is a spatially dependent rate that G C becomes G M . Equations 3 . 4 - 3 . 6 are solved numerically for the concentration proﬁles ( G M ( x ) , R ( x ) and G C ( x ) ) with the Jacobi method . These proﬁles are shown in Figure 3 . 2 B and the parameters used to ﬁnd these proﬁles are listed in Table 3 . 1 . 60 The binding rate for the recycled actin , R , to become F - actin is calculated by : r R ( x ) = a R ( x ) R ( x ) . ( 3 . 7 ) Each rate for G M and G C is calculated similarly . The simulation is moved for - ward in time using a 2D oﬀ - lattice Monte Carlo particle simulation as in [ 1 ] . The simulation box used was a rectangle extending 28 . 95 µm into the cell and 21 . 05 µm wide with reﬂecting boundaries . Each particle is either diﬀusing freely with a diﬀu - sion coeﬃcient chosen by whichever type of species the particle is , or it is a particle in the F - actin state and undergoing retrograde ﬂow . Particles are updated every time step , ∆ t , which is chosen to be suﬃciently small . The simulation is moved forward in time according to the reactions in Figure 3 . 2 A . If a particle is F - actin and its lifetime is up , it will dissociate into recycled actin , if not it will undergo retrograde ﬂow a distance v r ∆ t into the simulated cell in one time step . A recycled actin particle will diﬀuse with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D R unless its lifetime τ R is reached then it will become cytoplasmic actin . The recycled actin can also become F - actin before its lifetime is up with appearance rate of a R ( x ) . A cytoplasmic particle can become membrane bound with rate k ( x ) which is deﬁned in Table 3 . 1 or it can become F - actin with appearance rate a C ( x ) otherwise it will diﬀuse with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D C . A membrane bound particle may become cytoplasmic actin if the lifetime of τ GM is up . If the lifetime has not been reached it can also become F - actin with appearance rate a M ( x ) otherwise it will diﬀuse with diﬀusion coeﬃcient D M . Each parameter used can be found in Table 3 . 1 as well as the source or justiﬁcation for using that value . The system is initialized so that the concentrations matched those found after solving equations 3 . 4 - 3 . 6 . The lifetimes of the polymerized particles in the initial distribution were picked by applying Bayes’ rule [ 1 ] . The system was equilibrated for at least 200 s before simulating photoactivation . To simulate experimental images , the particles were treated as diﬀraction - limited spots that diﬀuse during camera exposure [ 1 ] . 61 Parameter Value Reference / Justiﬁcation D R 0 . 5 µm 2 / s Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] D C 3 . 0 µm 2 / s Measured in [ 12 ] D M 0 . 001 µm 2 / s Small value to represent slow diﬀusion of membrane - bound component G M v r 70 nm / s Measured in [ 12 ] K 0 . 25 s − 1 Estimated to give a ratio of F - actin to diﬀuse components as in Figure 3 . 2 C . τ R 20 s Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] τ M 0 . 5 s Smaller than 1 s A R 0 . 16 Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] , assuming 25 % of polymerization A C 0 . 21 events from the non - recycling pools at the leading edge are due to G C Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] , assuming 75 % of polymerization A M 0 . 63 events from the non - recycling pools at the leading edge are due to G M λ 1 0 . 5 µm Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] λ 2 4 µm Smith et al . 2013 [ 1 ] Selected to occur within a narrow region k ( x ) 20 s − 1 e − x / 0 . 5 µm close to the leading edge and with amplitude giving G M concentration higher than G C Table 3 . 1 : Parameter table for simulated photoactivation of actin 3 . 3 Comparison to experiment To perform simulated photoactivation of actin on a region , all particles outside of that region are deleted . Then , all the remaining particles are allowed to move and react in the way described above . 3 . 3 . 1 Photoactivation in 5 by 10 µ m box at Leading Edge An example of experimental photoactivation of PA - GFP actin is shown in Figure 3 . 3 A .

In the bottom panels of Figure 3 . 3 A , which is an inverted grayscale image , it is easier to see that there is incorporation of photoactivated actin at the leading edge indicating that some recycling occurs locally . We also ran a simulation of actin photoactivation of the same size and position as that in the experiment . In the simulation we see similar behavior shown in Figure 3 . 3 C , D with some local recycling with rebinding near the photoactivated region as well as similar decay in ﬂuorescence for the ROI . 63 3 . 3 . 2 Photoactivation in Cell Center 0 20 40 60 80 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 L .

Scale bar 5 µ m D ) Intensity of ﬂuorescence after simulated photoactivation within 1 µ m of the leading edge and entire cell center over time Figure 3 . 4 A shows the experimental images of photoactivation of the cell center . The PA - GFP actin within the cell center was activated to watch how the actin from the cell center moves out of the cell center and into the lamellipodium . The graph in Figure 3 . 4 B shows the normalized ﬂuorescence in two separate places , the leading edge , which is all the ﬂuorescence within 1 µ m of the leading edge of the cell and normalized to its maximum intensity , and the center , which is the total ﬂuorescence within the cell center and normalized to its beginning intensity . In Figure 3 . 4 A it can be seen that there is fast recovery at the leading edge of the cell . This brings up the question of whether diﬀusion is fast enough to allow travel from the cell center to the leading edge in this amount of time . With our model , we run a simulation of the same type of photoactivation where everything but the lamellipodium is activated 64 and then the recovery is monitored . The results of this simulation can be seen in Figure 3 . 4 C , D . The recovery and graphs both look similar to the experimental photoactivation when the graphs are normalized in the same way as the experimental data . Since our model is a reaction diﬀusion model with no active transport and the recovery at the leading edge happens on the same time scale as in the experiment , we can conclude that diﬀusion is likely suﬃcient for delivery of actin from the cell center to the leading edge of the cell . 3 . 3 . 3 Whole Lamellipodium Photoactivation 0 40 80 120 Time ( s ) Leading edge 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 F / F 0 A B C D Figure 3 . 5 : Experimental vs .

Scale bar 5 µ m D ) Intensity of ﬂuorescence after simulated photoactivation within 1 µ m of the leading edge The next photoactivation experiment performed by Eric Vitriol was activating the PA - GFP actin in the lamellipodium and observing how the ﬂuorescence changes within the cell . The experimental images of the photoactivation are shown in Figure 65 3 . 5 A . The ﬂuorescence at the leading edge of the cell ( within 1 µ m of the leading edge ) is monitored throughout time and normalized to the initial value in Figure 3 . 5 B . The ﬂuorescence decays to about 50 % of its original value where it plateaus . The authors of [ 12 ] suggest that this points to a pool of actin that is recycled within the lamellipodium which will be discussed more in Chapter 4 . We also run a photoac - tivation simulation activating the lamellipodium in the same way as the experiment in Figure 3 . 5 C . The leading edge simulated intensity is monitored over time and normalized in the same way as the experiment and shown in Figure 3 . 5 D . For the simulated image , the plateau of the ﬂuorescence occurs at the level of total amount of actin that was photoactivated . This may not be the case for the experimental PA - GFP photoactivation in CAD cells since the underlying mechanism may be more complicated than the mechanisms included in our model . This is discussed later in Chapter 4 . 3 . 4 Thymosin β 4 KD’s eﬀect on actin kinetics in the lamellipodium Thymosin β 4 ( T β 4 ) is a protein that is known to bind to actin monomers and sequester them , not allowing polymerization which is demonstrated in Figure 3 . 6 . About 70 % of G - actin is typically sequestered by thymosin β 4 [ 52 ] . It was previ - ously unclear how T β 4 aﬀected the kinetics of the lamellipodium . So the authors in [ 12 ] performed photoactivation experiments of PA - GFP actin to learn about these kinetics by knocking down T β 4 , using shRNA to knock down , and comparing these experiments to the control case . In Figure 3 . 7 A the cell center has been photoac - tivated and the leading edge is monitored to watch the recovery . The T β 4 KD experiment within the ﬁrst 60 s has a lag in recovery at the leading edge compared to the control case ( Figure 3 . 7 A . ) There is also a small diﬀerence in the F - actin pro - ﬁle between the control and knockdown case shown in Figure 3 . 7 B with the control slightly enhanced compared to the knockdown . We wanted to compare our model 66 Figure 3 . 6 : Thymosin β 4 sequesters actin monomers from Irobi et al . . An actin monomer is shown in gray while a Thymosin β 4 protein is seen in yellow and red and is bent around the actin monomer . Figure from [ 51 ] to the experimental photoactivation to explain this lag in recovery . After varying all parameters that would aﬀect this recovery , we found that in order to get a lag in recovery with our model we had to increase the binding rate of G C at the back of the lamellipodium shown in Figure 3 . 8 A . We also require the diﬀusion coeﬃcient to be reduced by 50 % in order to match the lag in recovery at the leading edge . This produces a steady state proﬁle for the T β 4 KD shown in Figure 3 . 8 B . These combined eﬀects give a lag in recovery at the leading edge in our simulations which is shown in Figure 3 . 8 C . From this we predicted a less sharp sigmoidal recovery at the back of the lamellipodium ( 2 - 3 µ m away from the leading edge ) for the T β 4 KD cells compared to the control case [ 12 ] which is also shown in Figure 3 . 8 C . This prediction about the experiments is correct and can be seen in Figure 3 . 9 . We also monitored the recovery within the cell center in the experimental case where the cell center is photoactivated ( Figure 3 . 10 A ) and found that there was good agreement with our simulated cell center activation ( Figure 3 . 10 B ) . Lamellipodium photoactivation was also simulated for T β 4 KD and compared to the control case 67 A B Figure 3 . 7 : Experimental control and T β 4 KD photoactivation and F - actin proﬁles .

C ) Simulated photoactivation of actin of the cell center for both control and T β 4 KD cases with intensity recorded at 0 - 1 µ m from the leading edge as well as 2 - 3 µ m from the leading edge . 68 Figure 3 . 9 : PA - GFP photoactivation of cell center with intensity recorded 2 - 3 µ m from the leading edge over time for both control and T β 4 KD over time [ 12 ] and by monitoring ﬂuorescence at the leading edge we found that there was little diﬀerence between the two cases ( Figure 3 . 10 C ) . We tested if the rate allowing G C to become G M was set to zero if this would give a similar eﬀect to the T β 4 KD experiments . So we performed a simulation with this in place and compared it to the control case as shown in Figure 3 . 10 D . There is also little diﬀerence between the case with the rate set to zero and the control case . Which means setting that rate to zero is not equivalent to the KD case . 3 . 5 Conclusions This collaboration with Eric Vitriol resulted in the following conclusions . We have shown that actin within the lamellipodium exists within two pools , one which is bound to Thymosin β 4 and allows for fast diﬀusion through the lamellipodium and another pool which diﬀuses slowly and is not bound to Thymosin β 4 [ 12 ] . Actin bound to Thymosin β 4 is prevented from binding to actin towards the back of the lamellipodium and tends to diﬀuse to the leading edge of the cell where it may associate in a complex with proﬁlin and allow the actin to incorporate into the actin network through the aid of formins . Although we suspect that Thymosin β 4 69 B C D A Experiment Simulation Simulation Figure 3 . 10 : Comparison of experimental photoactivation with simulated photoactiva - tion for control and T β 4 KD casess .

The model suggests that the actin that is not bound to Thymosin β 4 is incorporated into the actin network away from the leading edge . We also ﬁnd that diﬀusion is suﬃcient for delivery of actin to the leading edge and no active transport is needed in order to have actin delivered to the leading edge in a timely manner , although we ﬁnd that our system is close to being limited by diﬀusion . Thymosin β 4 aids in this diﬀusion by sequestering the actin monomers and not allowing them to bind promiscuously to other actin binding proteins throughout the lamellipodial network [ 12 ] . 71 Chapter 4 Turnover of Actin in 3D Whole Cell Model In previous modeling studies in this thesis , the modeling performed was in 2D and the 3D geometry of the cell was not taken into account . It is useful to investigate modeling done in 3D and include the complete geometry of the cell . In making a model of the cell that includes the whole cell instead of just the lamellipodium we can study if diﬀusion is suﬃcient for delivery of G - actin to the leading edge . Within the cell center there are some forms of F - actin that we have not included in previous models presented in this thesis . One is cortical actin which is located in the cortex of the cell . The cortex is located near the membrane of the cell . Other types of F - actin include stress ﬁbers and non - stress ﬁbers . These are F - actin populations that are near the basal surface of the cell . Stress ﬁbers are relatively long - lived with lifetimes in the range of minutes [ 35 ] while non - stress ﬁbers and cortical actin are generally more short lived with lifetimes on the order of tens of seconds [ 35 , 53 ] . Another consideration for our whole cell model is answering the question of how much actin is distributed within the lamellipodium compared to the rest of the cell . It is estimated in Vitriol et al . [ 12 ] that about 10 - 20 % of the total actin in the cell is in the lamellipodium . We are interested in checking if this is consistent with 72 Figure 3 . 5 and the estimation of the amount of actin in the lamellipodium given the information that we have with the photoactivation experiments . Some previous studies have suggested that diﬀusion is not fast enough to deliver monomeric actin to the leading edge of the cell . Zicha et al . [ 24 ] argue that the rapid delivery of actin to the leading edge after FLAP ( ﬂuorescence loss after photoactiva - tion , described in chapter 1 implies that it is impossible that diﬀusion is fast enough to allow this to happen . The authors argue this because 4 s after photoactivation occurs , photoactivated actin is seen at the leading edge of the cell which is pointed out by the arrows in Figure 4 . 1 . They develop a model in which they allow for only G - actin diﬀusion with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 5 . 65 µm 2 / s and ﬁnd that with this diﬀusion coeﬃcient and protrusion , they cannot account for the FLAP ratio that is seen in their experiments [ 24 ] . In order to account for this FLAP ratio enhancement at the leading edge they need to include a constant drift velocity for G - actin towards the leading edge of 6 µm / s [ 24 ] . By contrast another work based on s - FDAP suggests a high diﬀusion coeﬃcient of D = 13 . 7 µm 2 / s would be fast enough for delivery of G - actin to the leading edge of motile cells [ 13 ] . Figure 4 . 1 : FLAP showing fast delivery of diﬀuse actin to the leading edge of cell Zicha et al . Ratio of FLAP which shows newly photoactivated actin in hot colors and arrows point to spots where photoactivated actin arrived at the leading edge 4 s after photoactivation occurred . Figure from [ 24 ] Fan et al . [ 26 ] argue that Myo1 , which is a motor protein , is needed in order to transport G - actin to the leading edge of a motile cell . The support for their hypothesis can be seen in Figure 4 . 2 where in the top row they knocked down Myo1 73 ( which means that Myo1 has a lower expression rate than normal ) , by siRNA and shRNA , and they found that very little G - actin is at the leading edge of the cell . Open arrows indicate areas of reduced G - or F - actin [ 26 ] . The direction of motion of the cell is shown by the long solid arrow . In the bottom row , however , Myo1 levels are normal and there is more G - actin at the leading edge of the cell [ 26 ] , and the ﬁlled arrows indicate areas of enhanced G - or F - actin . The authors suggest that Myo1 is transporting G - actin to the leading edge of motile cells so that it can polymerize into F - actin [ 26 ] . Figure 4 . 2 : Fluorescent microscopy supporting the important role of Myo1 in the trans - port of G - actin to the leading edge of motile cells from Fan et al . Green tagged protein is G - actin and red tagged protein is F - actin . Top row : Myo1 has been suppressed and the eﬀect on actin kinetics is that not as much G - actin is seen at the leading edge of the motile cell . Bottom row : With Myo1 at normal levels G - actin can been seen localizing at the leading edge of motile cells . Figure from [ 26 ] 74 A B C D Figure 4 . 3 : Example of shape of 3D whole cell model .

For all imaged the diameter of the cell is 50 µ m . 4 . 1 Model Description The geometry of this simulated cell which is similar to CAD cells and non - polarized is modeled as follows : the lamellipodium consists of a disk with a height h lamell above 75 the slide and has a chosen width of w . The cell center is a half ellipsoid with x and y axes equal and the diameter of this center ellipsoid determined by taking the cell diameter and subtracting double the lamellipodium width . Some examples of the geometry are shown in Figure 4 . 3 A - D . Figure 4 . 3 A is the shape of the cell with no particles distributed inside the cell . The lamellipodium is the outer part of a thin disk while the cell center is a half ellipsoid that sits on top of the thin disk . Figure 4 . 3 B is an example of a cell that has particles distributed within it . Red particles are bound , blue particles are fast diﬀusing , and green particles are slower diﬀusing than the fast diﬀusing particles . Figure 4 . 3 C is a side view of the cell while D is a top view of the cell . 4 . 1 . 1 Lamellipodium Within the lamellipodium we use a previous model by Smith et al . [ 1 ] which is described in chapter 1 and is a model with both oligomers and monomers contributing to appearance events shown in Figure 4 . 5 . The model as stated in [ 1 ] is a 2D model written in Cartesian coordinates . In order for this model to be used in a circular geometry the 2D equations are written in polar coordinates . In this model the lamellipodium is only the thin annulus that does not touch the half - ellipsoid . The rates of binding are the same for each height within the lamellipodium but now are based on radial distance from the leading edge instead of distance from the leading edge which was used in [ 1 ] . Flow of the actin network rearward occurs in the radial direction ( remaining at the same height ) and moves a distance of v r dt each time step towards the center of the cell , where v r is the retrograde ﬂow velocity . Diﬀusion within the lamellipodium occurs and the boundaries of both the top and bottom of the lamellipodium as well as the edges exert a soft boundary force ( F = − kd , where d is the distance that the particle steps outside the boundary ) on diﬀuse particles that attempt to step outside the cell boundary to push the particle back within the cell . The distribution of F - , G - , and O - actin within the lamellipodium is shown in Figure 4 . 4 . 76 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 F - actin G - actin O - actin N o r m a li z ed C on c en t r a t i on s Radial distance from leading edge ( µm ) Figure 4 . 4 : Steady state concentrations for actin within the lamellipodium in 3D model . 4 . 1 . 2 Cell Center In the cell center there are both particles that are in the G - and F - actin pools . The density of G - actin within the cell center is calculated to be the same as the density of G - actin where the lamellipodium touches the cell center . F - actin within the cell center can be one of three diﬀerent types : stress ﬁbers , non - stress ﬁbers , or cortical actin . Stress ﬁbers and non - stress ﬁbers are localized in this model to the bottom of the cell center within a thickness that is equal to the thickness of 0 . 15 µ m [ 54 ] . The lifetimes of stress ﬁbers and non - stress ﬁbers can be found in Table 4 . 1 , where the lifetimes for stress ﬁbers and non - stress ﬁbers are measured from SiMS [ 35 ] . Cortical actin is localized in this model to the top dome of the ellipsoid within a thickness of 0 . 1 µ m [ 54 ] . The lifetimes of cortical actin can also be found in Table 4 . 1 and are measured from FRAP . The fast component of non - stress ﬁbers is on the order of the slower lifetime of cortical actin . F - actin can only be found near the cortex within the cell center and so the rates of binding from G - actin to F - actin take into account the 77 volume within the F - actin pool can exist . G - actin within the cell center is diﬀusing with the same rate as the G - actin within the lamellipodium . 4 . 1 . 3 Excluded volume Another feature within the cell is the organelles . For eukaryotic cells , the organelles that take up the most volume within the cell are the nucleus and mitochondria [ 55 ] . On average the nucleus occupies approximately 10 % of the cell volume [ 56 ] , while the mitochondria occupy about 20 - 25 % of the cell volume [ 55 ] . This means that the sum for all major organelles is about 30 - 35 % of the total volume is excluded for movement of protein . In order to account for this I have added one large excluded volume that occupies approximately 32 % of the cell that is ellipsoidal in shape and is placed within the cell center . This excluded volume represents both the nucleus and mitochondria combined because the other organelles take up much smaller amounts of volume within the cell . An example of this within the cell can be seen in Figure 4 . 6 . Figure 4 . 6 A shows a side view where the nucleus can be seen in black in the center of the cell while B shows a top view where the nucleus is more shaded than the rest of the cell . 4 . 1 . 4 Initialization Figure 4 . 5 : 3D Model with monomer and oligomers contributing to appearance events from [ 1 ] . 78 In order to initialize this simulation , we start by assuming that F - actin in the lamellipodium is distributed radially with the same F ( x ) described in 1 . 4 . We solve for G and O actin in polar coorinates . We can then solve these equations 1 . 8 - 1 . 10 numerically for G ( r ) and O ( r ) , where r is the radial distance from the leading edge of the cell . To then distribute the particles properly within the lamellipodium , which is a thin disk , the disk is broken up into small slices of dr so that within each slice particles can be placed correctly for each species . In order to place each particle one can ﬁnd the total number of particles for each species that should be in each dr slice . For any one slice , dr , for the model with only monomers as the diﬀuse species the fraction G - actin in that slice is given by : r i + 1 (cid:82) r i G ( r ) 2 πrdr L (cid:82) 0 G ( r ) 2 πrdr + L (cid:82) 0 F ( r ) 2 πrdr , ( 4 . 1 ) where L is the length of the lamellipodium . This is then done similarly for F - actin . If we use the model that includes oligomers and monomers contributing to appearance events , the denominator will also include the integral of O - actin for the entire lamellipodium . Particles within the lamellipodium are given lifetimes from the distribution measured from SiMS data . To distribute G - actin particles within the cell center , the density of particles is calculated based on the density of G - actin far from the leading edge in the lamel - lipodium . Then , using this density and the volume that is not excluded within the cell center the number of G - actin particles is calculated and that number of particles is placed randomly throughout the cell center . Particles in the F - actin pool are placed only within the cortex in the cell center . The number of F - actin particles placed depends on the ratio of G - : F - actin within the cell center that is chosen . If a 1 : 1 ratio is chosen then the same number of F - actin is placed as G - actin in the cell center . All the F - actin within the apical cortex is cortical actin and the fraction placed there ( of the total F - actin in the cell center ) is based on volume : V top shell / ( V top shell + V bottom disk ) where V top shell is the volume of 79 the top shell and V bottom disk is the volume of the bottom disk in the cell center . The actin in the apical cortex is given lifetimes of cortical actin given in Table 4 . 1 , and the actin in the basal cortex is split between stress ﬁbers and non - stress ﬁbers and is given lifetimes from Table 4 . 1 .

Diﬀuse particles within the lamel - lipodium are allowed to become F - actin with a rate given by r G ( x ) = a G ( x ) G ( x ) , ( 4 . 2 ) where a G ( x ) is the double exponential ﬁt to the appearance rate from SiMS , a G ( x ) = A 1 e − x / λ short + A 2 e − x / λ long . ( 4 . 3 ) Particles in the O - actin pool can become particles in the F - actin pool with rate : r O ( x ) = a O ( x ) O ( x ) . ( 4 . 4 ) Particles that are in the F - actin pool can become particles in the O - actin pool whenever the lifetime , which is chosen from an exponential distribution , of the F - actin pool is reached . Particles in the O - actin pool can also become particles in the G - actin pool when its lifetime , which is chosen from an exponential distribution , has expired . If a particle is in the F - actin pool and it has not reached its lifetime , it will undergo retrograde ﬂow in the radial direction away from the leading edge . If particles in the F - actin pool reach the back of the lamellipodium it is automatically depolymerized and turned into the fast diﬀusing G - actin pool . Within the cell center , if a particle is in the G - actin pool , unless it is near the membranes where particles in the F - actin pool are localized , it diﬀuses freely . How - ever , if particles in the G - actin pool are within the top shell where cortical actin exists the rate to bind is : r cort = V total V top (cid:18) C cort , short 1 τ cort , short + C cort , long 1 τ cort , long (cid:19) f cort , ( 4 . 5 ) where V total is the total available volume of the cell center , V top is the volume of the top shell where cortical actin exists , and f cort is the fraction of cortical actin 82 compared to the total F - actin in the cell center . F - actin in the cell center can become G - actin when their lifetimes expire . The F - actin lifetimes are chosen from exponential distributions depending on if the F - actin is designated as cortical actin , stress ﬁbers , or non - stress ﬁbers . Particles in the F - actin state do not move . Particles which try to step outside of the cell center , the top of the ellipsoid and the bottom of the disk , are moved towards the available space with step dx = const dt which corresponds to a constant forces inwards when crossing the boundary . The ellipsoid , which represents the volume taken up by the nucleus and mitochondria as well as other organelles , exerts the same soft boundary force normal to the surface as above to not allow diﬀusing particles to enter it so as to exclude that volume . 4 . 2 Results 4 . 2 . 1 Whole Lamellipodium Photoactivation In order to investigate recycling of actin within the lamellipodium , we photoactivated only the lamellipodium of our simulated cell and compared it to the experimental data from [ 12 ] . In doing this simulation we could see how various chosen parameters aﬀected the plateau level of ﬂuorescence decay . In Figure 4 . 7 A experimental pho - toactivation of PA - GFP actin of the lamellipodium is shown at various time points . Figure 4 . 7 B is a graph of the ﬂuorescence intensity over time within 1 µ m of the leading edge which is normalized to the intensity at the ﬁrst time point . The ﬂuo - rescence decays to a plateau within 40 s , and the level of this decay could mean two things : 1 ) 50 % of the PA - GFP actin is initally activated and then spread throughout the cell , or 2 ) a smaller fraction of PA - GFP actin than 50 % is initally activated but a big fraction remains trapped in the lamellipodium for long times . We suggest an experiment to resolve the diﬀerence between these two explanations by allowing the experiment to be recorded for longer times . Next we ran a simulation of photoactivation of the lamellipodium to observe if the simulated intensity decay at the leading edge of our model is similar to the 83 A D E B 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 50 100 150 200 High K no F - actin in center regular F - actin in center small volume regular F - actin in center small volume no F - actin in center and high K Experiment F / F 0 Time ( sec ) C 0 s 20 s 40 s 120 s 10 m 0 0 . 5 1 0 40 80 120 Leading Edge F / F 0 Time ( s ) Figure 4 . 7 : Experimental lamellipodium photoactivation compared to simulated pho - toactivation .

Figure 4 . 7 C shows an example of a simulation run with F - actin in the cell center as well as a value of K that is 1 . 5 s − 1 and a nucleus that occupies 32 % of the total cell volume which is within the range of total volume occupied by eukaryotic cell organelles . The of the leading edge graph of the particle number within 1 µ m is shown in Figure 4 . 7 D . This graph is normalized to the ﬁrst time point in the same manner as Figure 4 . 7 B . The plateau of simulated intensity decay in this simulation is lower than the plateau of ﬂuorescence decay in the experiment . In order to investigate various inﬂuences on decay , we varied some parameters in our simulation to see how they aﬀect the decay of particles near the leading edge after lamellipodium photoactivation . In Figure 4 . 7 E the black curve shows the experimental data while the blue curves are various simulation runs . The ﬁrst case to observe is the one with regular F - actin in the center . These simulations have a 1 : 1 ratio of G - to F - actin within the cell center . We suggest that one way to aﬀect the height of the plateau of the decay is to decrease the amount of actin in the cell center . So we maintained the same amount of G - actin within the cell center and removed all the F - actin within the cell center . ( This is also analogous to making all the F - actin in the cell center very long lived . ) This moved the plateau of the decay upward slightly , comparing the no F - actin in center curve to the regular F - actin in center curve in Figure 4 . 7 E . Another option would be to increase the amount of actin in the lamellipodium compared to the cell center . The most eﬀective way to do this is with the parameter K which adjusts the ratio of F - actin to G - actin . By making the parameter K larger we also make more actin in the lamellipodium . Another way to accomplish this same trend is simply to reduce the available volume within the cell center which is seen in the curve labeled small volume in cell center regular F - actin in Figure 4 . 7 E . Our closest ﬁt to experimental data with our simulation is obtained by combining all three of these methods : no F - actin in the cell center , a higher K value , and a smaller volume in the cell center seen in Figure 4 . 7 E . 85 A C D 0 s 20 s 40 s 120 s 0 s 20 s 40 s 120 s 0 0 . 5 1 0 40 80 120 PA ROI F / F 0 Time ( s ) B - 95 % Figure 4 . 8 : Experimental photoactivation compared to simulated photoactivation of 5 by 10 µ m box at leading edge of cell .

Figure 4 . 8 A shows experimental photoactivation at the leading edge of the cell . The bottom row of images is the inversion of the top row of images which is done to be able to more clearly see the reincorporation of PA - GFP actin at the leading edge and nearby the original photoactivated site . These images show that there is some recycling of actin within the lamellipodium locally around the photoactivated region . A graph of the ﬂuorescence decay within the photoactivated region is shown in Figure 4 . 8 B which is normalized to the intensity at time 0 s . There is a 90 % decay of ﬂuorescence within the bleached region in 140 s . Simulated images show a very similar trend with 86 local recycling in Figure 4 . 8 C where the bottom row of images is the inversion of the top row . One can see in Figure 4 . 8 C at the 20 s and 40 s time points that there is similar local recycling of actin nearby the photoactivated region throughout the lamellipodium as well as close to the leading edge of the cell . Figure 4 . 8 D is a graph of the particle number decay within the photoactivated region of the simulated cell that is normalized to the particle number at 0 s . It decays by 95 % in 140 s which is a very similar level to that seen in the experiment . 4 . 2 . 3 Photoactivation in Cell Center Cell center photoactivation in CAD cells of PA - GFP actin was performed in [ 12 ] to study movement of actin from within the cell center to the leading edge of the cell . Experimental photoactivation is shown in Figure 4 . 9 A along with an image of the cell before photoactivation expressing Lifeact . At 10 s after photoactivation of the center there is some ﬂuorescence seen at the leading edge of the cell . We want to know if diﬀusion is fast enough to account for this eﬀect . The graph in Figure 4 . 9 B monitors the ﬂuorescence in two separate places in the cell , one is the photoactivated region which is the cell center and the other is the leading edge of the cell which is within 1 µ m of the leading edge . The curve corresponding to the cell center is normalized to the intensity at time 0 s and the curve for the leading edge is normalized to the maximum intensity in the 90 s that the ﬂuorescence is monitored . Next we simulate photoactivation of the cell center . In Figure 4 . 9 C there are particles near the leading edge at 10 s similar to the experimental images . The band of particles broadens similarly throughout time to the experiments as well . The graph in Figure 4 . 9 D is normalized in the same way as in B except the maximum for the leading edge graph is near 200 s instead of within 80 s . The leading edge simulated intensity recovery in Figure 4 . 9 D is similar to the recovery in the experimental graph in B but more noisy because of a small particle number . There are a few notable diﬀerences , however , between the graphs in Figure 4 . 9 B and D . The cell center particle number in Figure 4 . 9 D does not decay as much as in the experimental 87 A B C D 10 m 0 s 10 s 20 s 90 s 0 0 . 5 1 0 20 40 60 80 Center ( F / F 0 ) L .

This could be due to a few things : one possibility is that there is more actin in the lamellipodium than is estimated in [ 12 ] which is discussed in 4 . 2 . 1 ; another possibility is that the photoactivation of the cell center is only occurring near the bottom surface of the cell for the experimental case . Then the ﬂuorescence decay would be greater if it is only monitored within the focal plane that is near the bottom of the cell and the decay would be greater because the photoactivated actin would 88 be able to move not only to the lamellipodium but also towards the top of the cell center . This doesn’t happen in Figure 4 . 9 C - D because we activate everything within the cell center and monitor everything within the cell center , making the decay less pronounced in Figure 4 . 9 D . In order to investigate how only activating a thin plane of particles near the bottom of the cell center would aﬀect the decay within the photoactivated region I activated a 0 . 3 µ m thickness bordering the bottom of the cell center excluding the lamellipodium shown in Figure 4 . 9 E . Then the particle number within the photoac - tivated region is recorded over time and normalized and plotted in the same way as in Figures 4 . 9 B and D . Decay of the particle number within the photoactivated region in the graph in Figure 4 . 9 F is now very similar to that seen in the experiment in Figure 4 . 9 B which means that this could be an explanation as to why activating the entire center gives us a diﬀerent decay within 80 s . 4 . 2 . 4 Half Cell Photoactivation Half of a CAD cell expressing PA - GFP actin was activated in Figure 4 . 10 A in [ 12 ] and monitored over time in order to observe how quickly actin equilibrates in the cell . The ﬂuorescence in the half of the cell that was photoactivated was normalized to the intensity at time 0 s is shown in a graph in Figure 4 . 10 B . At 88 s the ﬂuorescence has decayed to a level of about 70 % of the original level . Half of our simulated cell is also photoactivated and the particle number is monitored throughout time shown in Figure 4 . 10 C at the same time points as in the experiment . The graph of particle number decay within the original photoactivated half of the simulated cell is seen in Figure 4 . 10 D and is normalized in the same way as the graph for the experimental ﬂuorescence decay . The particle number decays to about 80 % of its initial value but if allowed to run for longer times decays to 50 % of its original value since that is how much actin is orignally activated within the cell . It is clear from looking at the graphs in Figure 4 . 10 B and D that the PA - GFP actin within the cell has not yet reached equilibrium and an experiment would need to be performed longer in order 89 to reach a steady state . Also , as in the previous section , it would be possible to simulate photoactivating only a thin slice of particles near the bottom of half the cell ; however , it would make little diﬀerence for this simulation since this activation would include particles within the lamellipodium and cell center unlike in Figure 4 . 9 where the activation was only occurring the cell center .

We also do not rule out the 90 possibility that there is a larger fraction of actin contained within the lamellipodium than predicted in [ 12 ] . More testing would need to be done in order to determine which possibility is correct . We also suggest that photoactivation of the cell center may be occurring for only photoactivatable proteins within the focal plane which is thin compared to the entire thickness of the entire cell . While monitoring the loss of ﬂuorescence within the cell center within the focal plane , the photoactivated particles might not be going only to the lamellipodium which is within the focal plane , but could also be diﬀusing outside of the focal plane towards to apical side of the cell . Our model supports the hypothesis that diﬀusion is fast enough to deliver G - actin to the leading edge for incorporation into the F - actin network for CAD cells in steady state and that active transport is not necessary for these cells . The model of Zicha et al [ 24 ] only considers a speciﬁc diﬀusion coeﬃcient that is obtained through a best ﬁt method in order to analyze whether diﬀusion is fast enough to allow delivery of G - actin to the leading edge and uses their model to describe motile cells . However , it would be more realistic if the diﬀusion coeﬃcient were chosen from a distribution instead . 91 Chapter 5 Conclusion In this thesis I studied turnover of actin protein and its regulators within motile cells . First I studied capping protein and the Arp2 / 3 complex within the lamellipodium . About 50 % of capping protein is estimated to be slowly diﬀusing [ 1 ] , in XTC cells and I suggested two models that include slowly diﬀusing capping protein and then use these models to simulate FRAP of capping protein and to compare with experimental FRAP from Kapustina et al . [ 3 ] . One mechanism for slow diﬀusing capping protein was that capping protein is pulled oﬀ the ends of actin ﬁlaments by the membrane of the cell and then stays associated with the membrane and continues to diﬀuse on the membrane until it dissociates from the membrane and diﬀuses freely . Another mechanism for slowly diﬀusing capping protein is that capping protein may be bound to the end of a slowly diﬀusing actin oligomer . This work motivates experiments for photoactivation of capping protein experiments to distinguish between these two mechanisms and monitor where the ﬂuorescence would ﬁrst move to directly after photoactivation . Slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex has also been observed in Milius et al . [ 6 ] . We propose two models for the Arp2 / 3 complex kinetics and use them to simulate FRAP and then compare to experimental FRAP of the Arp2 / 3 complex from [ 2 ] . One model we test has no slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex , and the other model includes slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex that diﬀuses slowly while bound 92 to the membrane . The model that includes slowly diﬀusing Arp2 / 3 complex was developed based on the observations from Milius et al . [ 6 ] and ﬁts the experimental FRAP data from Lai et al . [ 2 ] better than the model with a single diﬀuse species of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Next , we developed a model for actin turnover in the lamellipodium that included 3 diﬀuse pools of actin which were then used to simulate photoactivation to com - pare to experimental photoactivation of PA - GFP actin . One pool was fast diﬀusing actin that was in dynamic equilibrium with thymosin β 4 . The second pool recycled actin which was slowly diﬀusing . The third pool was actin bound to the membrane . Together with experiments by Vitriol [ 12 ] , we ﬁnd that thymosin β 4 aids in the fast diﬀusion of actin to the leading edge of the cell to incorporate into the F - actin net - work . We suspect that thymosin β 4 may make a complex with proﬁlin at the leading edge of the cell , and this aids in polymerization of actin at the leading edge . Using our model , we ﬁnd that diﬀusion is suﬃcient for delivery of actin to the leading edge of the cell although this diﬀusion is close to being limiting for delivery of actin to the leading edge because of gradients of diﬀuse actin concentration near the leading edge . Finally , we utilize a previous model of actin in the lamellipodium from [ 1 ] and similar to the model used above in a 3D whole cell model of actin turnover to simulate photoactivation of actin and compare to experimental photoactivation of PA - GFP actin . In doing this , we learn that we cannot rule out the possibly that some fraction of actin within the lamellipodium is continuously recycled ; however , it is also possible that the level of the decay plateau represents the fraction of actin contained within the photoactivated region compared to the entire cell . Our model suggests that diﬀusion of actin is fast enough to deliver G - actin to the leading edge of the stationary cell without active transport . Future work would include modeling other actin regulating proteins within the lamellipodium for which SiMS data is available such as : Coﬁlin , AIP1 , VASP , and WAVE complex . Other work could be done in extending the model within the 93 lamellipodium to a 3D whole cell model in order to study the protein’s role within the entire cell instead of just the lamellipodium and to study how protein in the bulk of the cell might aﬀect the kinetics of that protein within the lamellipodium . Utilizing the 3D whole cell model , s - FDAP [ 13 ] could be simulated and compared with experimental s - FDAP to draw conclusions on various proteins at diﬀerent parts of the cell , including the lamellipodium and cell center . 94 Bibliography [ 1 ] Matthew B .
