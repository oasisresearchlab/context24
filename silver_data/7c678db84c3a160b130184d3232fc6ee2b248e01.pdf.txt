These gradients are generated by cell - type speciﬁc secretion or export and speciﬁc degradation in receiving cells . Spatial information is sensed by dedicated seven - transmembrane G - protein coupled receptors and yeast cells are able to detect extremely small differences in ligand concentration across their (cid:2) 5 - m m cell surface . Here , I will discuss our current knowledge of how cells detect and respond to such shallow chemical gradients and in particular what is known about the proteins that are involved in directional growth and the establishment of the polarity axis during yeast mating . C hemical gradients play critical roles in a large number of developmental processes . These gradients , which are precisely controlled at both temporal and spatial levels , provide an efﬁcient means of encoding vectorial information . Although diverse fungi generate chemical pheromone gradients during mating , because of its genetic tractability , most studies on chemical gradients in yeast have focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae . This review will focus on the role of chemical pheromone gradients during S . cerevisiae mating , as our knowledge of the molecular details of this chemotropic process is most advanced . This review is divided into four main sections : gradients , sensing and detection , cellular responses , and signal ampliﬁcation . The second and third sections are further divided , with the second section addressing the roles of pheromone receptors and hetero - trimeric G - proteins , as well the mechanisms involved in detection of small differences in ligand con - centration across a yeast cell . The third section focuses on the different cellular responses during chemotropism , in addition to what is known about how a growth site and an axis of polarity are established in response to an exter - nal gradient . GRADIENTS Most fungi produce diffusible peptide mating pheromones and in general , there are two different peptide mating factors ( reviewed in Caldwell et al . 1995 ) in each species . Given the dynamic nature of pheromone gradients , it is not surprising that they have not been directly measured . Rather , various methods have been used to generate such gradients artiﬁcially and to determine cellular responses over a range of Editors : James Briscoe , Peter Lawrence , and Jean - Paul Vincent Additional Perspectives on Generation and Interpretation of Morphogen Gradients available at www . cshperspectives . org Copyright # 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ; all rights reserved .

During S . cerevisiae mating , pheromone gradi - ents are generated by the secretion of a - and a - factor . There are three factors that are likely to be important for the generation of phero - mone gradients : ﬁrst , the physical character - istics of the mating pheromone ; second , the site ( s ) of pheromone secretion or export ; and third , the distribution of proteases that degrade mating pheromone . The shape of a mating pheromone gradient is likely to be dependent on the diffusibility of the mating peptide , and as a - factor is farnesylated , its diffu - sion in aqueous environments is decreased . This posttranslational modiﬁcation may be critical in hydrophobic milieu , such as cellular mem - branes or natural habitats including bioﬁlms . The increased hydrophobicity and reduced diffusibility of a - factor ( Caldwell et al . 1994 ; Khouri et al . 1996 ) may contribute to the further sharpening ( increasing the steepness ) or stabilizing of its gradient compared with that of a - factor . Furthermore , pheromones are likely to be secreted ( a - factor ) or exported ( a - factor via the Ste6 transporter ) from the tip of shmoos ( Kuchler et al . 1993 ) , and this site - speciﬁc release will dictate the shape of the gradient . Site - speciﬁc secretion or export will generate anisotropy in the mating pheromone gradient , which should provide information on cell po - sition . Speciﬁcally , the location of a particular shmoo tip should be evident by the position , direction , and shape of its pheromone gradient . Mating pheromone proteases are also secreted , yet little is known about whether their secretion occurs at a speciﬁc site . Proteases , such as the barrier aspartyl protease Bar1 , limits the distance of the a - factor trideca - peptide gradient ( Barkai et al . 1998 ) . Similarly , a protease activity that degrades a - factor has been identiﬁed in MAT a cells ( Marcus et al . 1991 ) . Each of these pheromone proteases are expressed only in receiving cells . The a - factor protease Bar1 is largely secreted , with 95 % of the Bar1 activity found extracellularly ( Ciejek and Thorner 1979 ; Ballensiefen and Schmitt 1997 ) . This protease has also been found , however , attached to the cell wall ( Moukadiri et al . 1999 ) . a - factor protease activity is also essentially cell - associated ( Marcus et al . 1991 ) . A gradient of secreted a - factor protease , or cell - associated a - factor protease , is likely to sharpen the pheromone gradient . Finally , pheromone degradation via a cell - associated protease has been proposed as a means for dis - tinguishing potential mating partners amongst many cells ( Barkai et al . 1998 ) . SENSING AND DETECTION Pheromone Receptors Yeast cells must detect a mating pheromone gradient to initiate a range of cellular responses . Critical for such detection are the classi - cal seven - transmembrane domain receptors coupled to hetero - trimeric G - proteins ( for review , see Xue et al . 2008 ) , the a - cell speciﬁc Ste2 ( which binds a - factor ) , and the a - cell speciﬁc Ste3 ( which binds a - factor ) . These receptors do not share substantial sequence homology . Transcription of both receptors is rapidly increased on addition of the respective pheromone ( Hagen and Sprague 1984 ; Hartig et al . 1986 ) . Haploid a - cells have (cid:2) 10 , 000 cell - surface binding sites for a - factor with a K d of 4 – 6 nM ( Jenness et al . 1986 ; Stefan et al . 1998 ) . This high - afﬁnity receptor resting state is converted to a low - afﬁnity state , with an (cid:2) 10 - fold increase in ligand off - rate and corresponding increase in K d , in the presence of GTP g S ( Blumer and Thorner 1990 ) . When haploid a - cells bind a - factor , Ste2 receptors are internalized with a t avg . of (cid:2) 8 min ( Schandel and Jenness 1994 ) and reappear on the cell surface after (cid:2) 60 min ( Jenness and Spatrick 1986 ; Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ; Stefan et al . 1998 ) . Both a - and a - factor re - ceptors have substantial—183 and 133 amino acids , respectively—cytoplasmic carboxy ter - mini . Truncation of the Ste2 carboxy - terminal 105 amino acids results in a (cid:2) ﬁvefold increase in cell surface pheromone binding sites , a 10 - fold increase in pheromone sensi - tivity , and a defect in pheromone induced morphogenesis ( Konopka et al . 1988 ) . Ste2 receptors also oligomerize in vivo , yet this association does not depend on ligand R . A . Arkowitz 2 Advanced Online Article .

Ste2 transmembrane domains ﬁve and six together with the intervening third intracellular loop are important for G - protein activation , via G a ( Konopka and Jenness 1991 ; Clark et al . 1994 ; Stefan and Blumer 1994 ; Dube et al . 2000 ; Celic et al . 2003 ; Lin et al . 2003 ) . The carboxy - terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor interacts with G a in a preactivation complex ( Dosil et al . 2000 ; Wu et al . 2004 ) . The extracellular end of transmembrane domain 1 , together with the extracellular loops 1 and 2 , interact directly with pheromone ( Son et al . 2004 ; Hauser et al . 2007 ) . Although pheromone receptors are necessary for detect - ing pheromone , it is likely that their internali - zation and recycling play an important role in signal ampliﬁcation and desensitization . In the absence of mating pheromone , both pheromone receptors localize uniformly over the cell surface as well as endosomal and vacuole compartments ( Jackson and Hartwell 1990b ; Davis et al . 1993 ; Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ; Stefan and Blumer 1999 ) . During the later stages of mating , Ste2 is localized to mating projections , raising the possibility that this polarized distribution is important for chemotropic growth ( Jackson et al . 1991 ) . In cells treated with isotropic saturating pheromone concentrations , little receptor was observed on the cell surface after 20 min and instead a punctate cytoplasmic dis - tribution was observed ( Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ) . Finally , after (cid:2) 90 min , the receptor was localized to the mating projection , enriched at the tip ( Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . In these conditions , the actin cytoskeleton is required for Ste2 polarization ( Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ) . It is likely that the actin cytoskeleton is critical for receptor exocytosis and endocytosis , which are important for the receptor polarization ( via targeting and main - tenance ) . It will be essential to follow receptor distribution during chemotropism ( in response to deﬁned pheromone gradients and during mating ) to better understand the role of recep - tor secretion , endocytosis , and polarization during directional growth . Hetero - trimeric G - protein The pheromone receptor functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for G a . On phero - mone binding , the receptor catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the G a † GDP G bg complex , resulting in the dissociation of G a † GTP from G bg ( reviewed in Dohlman and Thorner 2001 ; Dohlman 2002 ) . G a and G bg are then able to associate and activate downstream effectors . This signaling compe - tent state of the G a and G bg subunits exists until the G a † GTP is hydrolyzed . RGS ( Regulators of G protein Signaling ) proteins such as Sst2 , function as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPs facilitating G a GTP hydro - lysis ( Apanovitch et al . 1998 ; DiBello et al . 1998 ) . Receptor and hetero - trimeric G - protein turnover , either by cellular uptake ( endocytosis ) or posttranslational modiﬁcation ( including modiﬁcations that target proteins for degra - dation ) also contribute to down - regulation . Initial studies indicated that released G bg functions in a positive fashion by initiating a range of pheromone responses ( Jahng et al . 1988 ; Whiteway et al . 1989 ; Cole et al . 1990 ; Nomoto et al . 1990 ) including cell cycle arrest , gene transcription , cell morphology changes , and chemotropic growth ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . More recently , however , several studies have revealed that G a , in addition to its role as a negative regulator ( via inactivation of released G bg ) , can also activate signaling ( Metodiev et al . 2002 ; Slessareva et al . 2006 ) . The G a , G b , and G g subunits are all local - ized to the plasma membrane and internal membranes , with G a and G g each having dual posttranslational lipid modiﬁcations that result in membrane association ( Song et al . 1996 ; Hirschman et al . 1997 ) . These modiﬁ - cations are necessary for function , with G a being both palmitoylated and myrisotoylated ( Stone et al . 1991 ; Dohlman et al . 1993 ; Song and Dohlman 1996 ; Song et al . 1996 ; Manahan et al . 2000 ) and G g being palmitoy - lated and prenylated ( Grishin et al . 1994 ; Whiteway and Thomas 1994 ; Hirschman and Jenness 1999 ) .

Conversely , although G a is required for G bg membrane localization , the pheromone receptor is not required ( Song et al . 1996 ; Hirschman et al . 1997 ) . The locali - zation of the G a ( Metodiev et al . 2002 ) , G b ( Kim et al . 2000 ) , and G g ( Nern and Arkowitz 2000a ; Moore et al . 2008 ) has been examined in both isotropic pheromone concentrations ( G a and G b ) and in pheromone gradients during mating or generated artiﬁcially ( G g ) ( Fig . 1 ) . These three proteins localize preferen - tially to the mating projection ( also appear on internal membranes ) , similar to the dis - tribution of the pheromone receptor ( Jackson et al . 1991 ; Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . The subcellular distribution of the different hetero - trimeric G - protein subunits and their relationship to one another during the mating process ( chemotropic growth ) has not been quantitatively examined at high tem - poral and spatial resolution . Such analyses will be important for understanding the require - ments and feedback loops that are necessary for chemotropic growth . Detection of Small Differences in Ligand Concentration It is highly unlikely that yeast cells use a tem - poral mechanism to detect small differences in ligand concentration given that they grow rela - tively slow , i . e . , maximally their 5 m m diameter after (cid:2) 6 h in pheromone ( Segall 1993 ; Vallier et al . 2002 ) . It is largely accepted , that yeast cells use a spatial detection mechanism , as is the case for leukocytes , in which pheromone concentration is compared on two sides of the cell . If a gradient is generated by a micropipet ( Fig . 4 ) , using a 70 - nM a - factor solution , released at a rate of 2 nL / min and cells are posi - tioned (cid:2) 50 m m from the tip of the micropipet , then the cell half closest to the pipet is estimated to experience 11 . 5 - nM a - factor and that far - thest from the pipet 10 . 2 - nM a - factor ( Segall 1993 ; Vallier et al . 2002 ) . Assuming a uniform distribution of receptors , (cid:2) 66 more receptors would have pheromone bound closest to the gradient compared with the opposite side ( a difference in receptor occupancy of (cid:2) 1 . 3 % ) . A recent study using microﬂuidics chamber - generated pheromone gradients ( Fig . 4 ) has extended these calculations based on the observation that yeast cells can sense the direction of the pheromone gradient with a slope relative to the average concentration ( [ pheromone slope ] / [ pheromone conc . at the mid point ] ) as shallow as 0 . 1 % / m m 2 1 ( Moore et al . 2008 ) ; a difference of 0 . 5 % in ligand concentration from the cell front and back . When cells are in a 0 – 1000 - nM gradient at an average concentration of 500 nM , then the absolute slope is 2 . 5 nM / m m . This results in 4951 and 4950 receptors occupied in the front 10 min 60 min 120 min 180 min 200 min Figure 2 . Cell morphology changes in response to mating pheromone .

Strikingly , a bar1 mutant strain was able to weaklyorient ( cosine of the angle of orientation (cid:2) 0 . 2 : angle of (cid:2) 78º ) to a 0 – 1000 - nM phero - mone gradient at . 900 - nM pheromone , in which all receptors should be saturated . Furthermore , this elegant microﬂuidics study revealed that bar1 mutants are able to orient their growth to a gradient over almost three orders of magnitude ( 4 nM – 930 nM ) . The calculations of receptor occupancy and gra - dient detection assume constant number of pheromone receptors , i . e . , do not take into consideration receptor induction , exocytosis , and endocytosis . These different processes undoubtedly affect the real difference in recep - tor occupancy in a pheromone gradient , yet nevertheless , an extremely small difference in ligand concentration is likely to be detected during mating . How this very small difference is translated into much steeper intracellular gradient ( s ) remains a fundamental question . Cellular responses can either be dictated by absolute pheromone concentrations or the fractional change in concentration ( D [ pheromone ] / D distance , i . e . , gradient steepness ) across the cell ( Walter et al . 1990 ; Goodhill 1998 ; Goodhill and Baier 1998 ) . In nerve growth cones ( Isbister et al . 2003 ) and in round immobile latrunculin - treated Dictyostelium discoideum ( Janetopoulos et al . 2004 ) , directional responses are dictated by the gradient steepness as has also been observed in chemotaxing neutrophils ( Zigmond 1977 ) .

Fractional gradient is the ratio of the pheromone concentration gradient ( offset by a gradient value g 0 ; g 2 g 0 ) , and the difference between the mean pheromone and minimum pheromone concentration necessary for shmoo formation , and can be thought of as the steepness of the gradient divided by the pheromone concentration . Accuracyof gradient sensing was highest at low pheromone concen - trations and high gradients ( Segall 1993 ; Paliwal et al . 2007 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . Accuracy of gradient sensing is the cosine of the angle of the mating projection relative to the pheromone gradient ; a value of one indicates perfect alignment . Indeed , gradient sensing appears to be optimal near the pheromone concentra - tion that equals the receptor K d ( Segall 1993 ; Paliwal et al . 2007 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . Precision of gradient sensing has been deﬁned as the root mean square ( rms ) of several cells between the angles of observed mating projec - tions and the direction of the gradient , with pre - cision increasing as rms decreases ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ) . Furthermore , the precision of gradient sensing is constant at a constant fractional gra - dient and increases as the fractional gradient increases ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ) . It is thought that the combination of constant pheromone release ( although this has not been validated experimentally ) , together with ﬁrst - order reaction of pheromone degradation by the extracellular proteases , should result in an exponential gradient ( Barkai et al . 1998 ) . Hence , as cells grow toward the source of an exponential gradient , both the gradient steep - ness and the pheromone concentration would increase , resulting in a constant fractional gradi - ent and hence constant precision of gradient sensing ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ) . Although this makes biological sense , it remains to be seen if the precision of directional sensing is indeed constant throughout the mating process . In response to a micropipet - generated pheromone gradient ( Fig . 4 ) , orientation accu - racy of yeast cells increases over time ( cosine of the angle of orientation increasing from (cid:2) 0 . 55 ; angle of (cid:2) 57º to 0 . 85 ; angle of (cid:2) 32º from shmoo formation to (cid:2) 5 h later ) ( Vallier et al . 2002 ) . These results suggest that mating projec - tion reorientation can occur over time ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ) . Very recently , studies using microﬂuidics chamber - generated pheromone gradients ( Fig . 4 ) conﬁrmed that directional accuracy improves over time ( Moore et al . 2008 ) . In the range of 5 – 40 nM of a - factor ( in a 0 – 100 nM gradient ) , cells formed broad mating projections which reoriented toward the gradient , with an orientation accuracy of (cid:2) 0 . 4 ( angle of 66º ) to (cid:2) 0 . 6 ( angle of 53º ) at 2 and 6 h , respectively . At pheromone concen - trations greater than 50 nM , cells frequently formed a second mating projection that was more oriented than the ﬁrst ( Moore et al . 2008 ) . Assuming that the pheromone gradient is linear , then this increase in the precision of gradient sensing over time can be explained by an increase in the fractional gradient : The pheromone concentration should increase (cid:2) 10 % – 20 % , given the above parameters at an average pheromone concentration of the recep - tor K d over one to two cell lengths . Using a micropipet - generated pheromone gradient , cells lacking the Bar1 protease orient similarly to wild - type cells , at low pheromone concentration ( Segall 1993 ) . The bar1 D mutant was extensively characterized in a recent micro - ﬂuidics chamber study ( Moore et al . 2008 ) . Compared with a wild - type BAR1 þ strain , bar1 D cells oriented to 0 – 100 nM and 0 – 1000 nM pheromone gradients with decreased accuracy . Furthermore , Bar1 functioned even in the constant ﬂow ( 1 m L / min ) in (cid:2) 1 m L chambers , consistent with cell - wall associated protease ( Moukadiri et al . 1999 ) . Surprisingly , both BAR1 þ and bar1 D cells exhibited the best orientation at [ pheromone ] avg . that were equiv - alent to the receptor K d ( Moore et al . 2008 ) . However , it should be pointed out that in the case of the bar1 D cells , this was in a relatively steep portion of a 0 – 10 nM pheromone gra - dient , whereas for BAR1 þ cells , this was at a shallow portion of a 0 – 100 nM pheromone gra - dient , suggesting that Bar1 facilitates sensing of shallow gradients .

Consistent with results using a micro - pipet - generated gradient ( Segall 1993 ) , at low pheromone concentrations ( 0 – 10 nM gradi - ent ) , the accuracy of orientation of bar1 D sst2 D cells was less than the corresponding bar1 D cells in the same conditions ( Moore et al . 2008 ) . CELLULAR RESPONSES Gene Induction In response to pheromone gradients , cells induce gene transcription , undergo cell cycle arrest , change shape , and grow toward a mating partner . The ﬁrst three responses can occur during mating , in which a pheromone gradient is present , as well as in an isotropic pheromone concentration . The latter response , however , only occurs when a pheromone gradi - ent ispresent . The optimum mating pheromone concentration for gene induction , cell cycle arrest , and cell shape changes does not seem to differ substantially between isotropic and gradi - ent pheromone conditions ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . Recently , it has been shown that the pheromone concentration range of gra - dients at which cells are sensitive for induction of the mating - speciﬁc gene FUS1 coincides with that for directional growth ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . This may be because some genes essential for gradient sensitivity are induced by this MAP kinase cascade or that , despite the ability to genetically separate the MAP kinase and chemotropism pathways ( Schrick et al . 1997 ; Strickfaden and Pryciak 2008 ) , there may be cross - talk between these pathways . More than 100 genes are induced by pheromone ( Erdman et al . 1998 ) . Genes whose induction is more efﬁcient with a pheromone gradient than with an isotropic pheromone concentration would be ideal candidates for modulators of the chemotropic response . Cell Shape Changes In yeast , as in many organisms , changes in cell shape can be separated from directional growth . In isotropic pheromone conditions , yeast cells become elongated and form shmoos ( Fig . 2 ) . A range of proteins are necessary for these morphology changes , some of which are mating - speciﬁc , and others are more generally involved in cell polarity yet appear to have speciﬁc functions in response to pheromone ( Table 1 ) . This process is referred to as “default” polarization ( Madden and Snyder 1992 ; Dorer et al . 1995 ) and the previous bud site provides the spatial cue for mating projection formation . In addition to the receptor and hetero - trimeric G - protein , the pheromone - dependent MAP kinase Fus3 and the pheromone - induced proteins Afr1 and Pea2 are required for shmoo formation ( Chenevert et al . 1994 ; Valtz and Herskowitz 1996 ; Matheos et al . 2004 ) . Other proteins required for cell polarity are particularly impor - tant for morphology changes in response to pheromone . Pheromone - dependent cell - shape changes can be separated from chemotropic growth . This may be , in part , because of the fact that most studies on cell - shape changes have been performed in saturating pheromone concentrations that may mask chemotropic effects . Directional Growth Different assays have shown that the pheromone receptor , the hetero - trimeric G - protein , and several proteins that bind speciﬁcally to the released G a and G bg convey the spatial infor - mation from the pheromone gradient to the downstream proteins critical for pheromone - dependent morphology changes ( Table 1 ) . Elegant studies showed that both MAT a and MAT a cells choose between potential mating partners ( Jackson and Hartwell 1990a ; Jackson and Hartwell 1990b ) . Speciﬁcally , each cell type chooses the mating partner that produces the highest level of pheromone . The simplest model to account for this is that cells detect a mating pheromone gradient and orient growth toward the cell producing the steepest gradient ( Fig . 3 ) . In these studies , two assays were used : the competition mating assay and the discrimination assay . In both assays , a cell Chemical Gradients and Chemotropism in Yeast Advanced Online Article .

In the competition assay , there are two types of mating partners present : target and challenger cells . Typically , the target cells are wild - type , and the genotype of the challenger cells is varied . The importance of a given challenger cell is assessed by its effect on the mating of signaling cells with the target ( responder ) cells . In the discrimination assay , the relative mating efﬁciency of one cell with two different partners is determined , measuring the ability of one cell to discriminate between two mating partners . The confusion assay examines the importance of the pheromone gradient during mating by determining the effect of disrupting the gradient by a - factor addition ( Dorer et al . 1995 ; Valtz et al . 1995 ) . This results in a substantial decrease in mat - ing efﬁciency with wild - type cells not ob - served , however , with chemotropism mutants . Although these assays are extremely useful in the identiﬁcation and analysis of cellular components required for chemotropic growth , they are indirect measures of chemotropism . The pheromone receptor , the G a , G b and G g subunits , Sst2 , and Bar1 have been shown by both the discrimination and confusion assays to be important for chemotropism Table 1 .

The discrimination assay has also revealed that actin , myosin V , and clathrin are likely to be required for che - motropism ( Jackson et al . 1991 ) . The effects of the sst2 and bar1 mutants in the discrimination and confusion assays is probably caused by their altered pheromone sensitivity ( Jackson and Hartwell 1990a ; Dorer et al . 1995 ) . These assays have also shown that different com - ponents of the pheromone - dependent MAP kinase pathway are not required for chemotrop - ism ( Schricket al . 1997 ; Strickfaden and Pryciak 2008 ) . Interestingly , MAP kinase Fus3 mutants are somewhat defective in mating - partner dis - crimination ( Dorer et al . 1997 ) , whereas fus3 D kss1 D mutants are not . In contrast , both of these mutants are unaffected in the pheromone - confusion assay ( Dorer et al . 1997 ) . A far1 D mutant was only slightly defective in the discrimination assay , yet fully defective in the pheromone confusion assay ( Dorer et al . 1995 ; Valtz et al . 1995 ) . Speciﬁc mutants for the a - factor receptor , G a , and G b have also been examined with these assays ; the former two are defective in the mating partner discrimination assay ( Jackson and Hartwell 1990a ; Metodiev et al . 2002 ) , and latter is defective in the confusion assay ( Strickfaden and Pryciak 2008 ) . The defect of the Ste2 mutant lacking its cytoplasmic carboxy terminal tail ( ste2 - T326 ) in the mating partner discrimination assay is thought to be becauseofitsincreasedsensitivitytopheromone ( Jackson and Hartwell 1990a ) . The mating partner discrimination defect observed with the gpa1 EE mutant , together with the obser - vation that it is defective in binding Fus3 , suggests that released G a † GTP recruits Fus3 , which then phosphorylates proteins required for chemotropism . The G b mutations ste4 [ K126E ] and ste4 [ L117R ] disrupt inter - actions with G a and the pheromone receptor ( Strickfaden and Pryciak 2008 ) . Finally , both discrimination and confusion assays have been used to conﬁrm that a range of proteins required for polarized growth and morphology changes in response to pheromone—such as Spa2 , Bni1 , Fus1 , Fus2 , Pea2 , Rvs161 , Bud proteins , Myo4 , and tubulin—are not necessary for che - motropism ( Jackson et al . 1991 ; Dorer et al . 1997 ) . Segall developed a direct measure of che - motropism in which the direction of growth of MAT a cells in a micropipet - generated gradient is followed ( Segall 1993 ) . This assay was used to show that bar1 mutants orient their growth normally toward the pheromone source , whereas sst2 mutants are somewhat defective . This assay has also revealed that bud1 , spa2 , kss1 , afr1 , ste20 and mating defective bem1 - m1 mutants all orient their growth normally in a pheromone gradient ( Leberer et al . 1997 ; Butty et al . 2002 ; Vallier et al . 2002 ) . A ste2 - T326 mutant orients growth in a phero - mone gradient ( at lower pheromone concen - trations compared with the wild type ) , yet is unable to increase its orientation toward the source of pheromone over time as is observed with wild - type cells ( Vallier et al . 2002 ) . Far1 ( far1 - H7 and far1 - D1 ) and cdc24 ( cdc24 - m1 and cdc24 - m3 ) mutant alleles , which are speciﬁ - cally defective in mating , are defective in the pheromone - confusion assay and in oriented growth toward a pheromone gradient ( Valtz et al . 1995 ; Nern and Arkowitz 1998 ) . Both of these types of mutants , instead , orient their mating projections adjacent to the site of their previous bud scar , i . e . , mate by default . Considered together , results suggest that two different landmarks , either that dictated by previous bud site or by pheromone gradient , activate the small G - protein Cdc42 ; Cdc42 , in turn , is critical for directing the actin cyto - skeleton and ultimately the site - speciﬁc incorporation of new plasma membrane and cell - wall material . It is presumed that limiting amounts of the Cdc42 activator Cdc24 , at either site ensures that budding and shmooing can not occur simultaneously . Recently , phero - mone gradients generated in a microﬂuidics chamber have been used to assess yeast che - motropism ( Fig . 4 ) ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ; Hao et al . 2008 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . The advantage of this method is that the pheromone gradient can be exquisitely controlled and its slope and concentration can be easily quantiﬁed . These studies have shown quantitatively that optimal R . A . Arkowitz 12 Advanced Online Article .

At low pheromone concentrations , in which bar1 mutant strains are able to orient their mating projections , a kss1 D bar1 mutant is somewhat defective . Hence , the kss1 D mutation decreases the range of pheromone concentra - tion at which a directional response is efﬁcient and in addition , this mutant is defective in improving its directional growth over time ( Paliwal et al . 2007 ) . Another microﬂuidics - chamber study showed that fus3 D BAR1 cells and a Ste5 mutant in which Fus3 docking is defective ( ste5 ND in combination with kss1 D ) were both defective in chemotropic growth , whereas kss1 D BAR1 mutants were unaffected ( Hao et al . 2008 ) . Together , these studies highlight the importance of the pheromone - dependent MAP kinases in chemotropic growth . It is likely that the different results regarding the chemotropism of kss1 D strains is caused by the presence or absence of Bar1 , which alters the shape of the pheromone gradient . A recent microﬂuidics - chamber gradient study ( Moore et al . 2008 ) revealed that a Ste2 receptor truncation mutant , ste2 300 D ( in a bar1 D strain ) was unable to orient toward a shallow gradient at high pheromone concen - trations ( (cid:2) 90 nM a - factor in a 0 – 100 nM gra - dient ) , yet was able to orient toward the same gradient at lower pheromone concentrations . In a 0 – 1000 nM pheromone gradient , the orientation defect of these cells is more striking . It is likely that these mutants are defective in maintaining oriented growth ( Vallier et al . 2002 ) . Together , these defects ( Vallier et al . 2002 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) suggest that the recep - tor carboxy - terminal tail may be important for signal ampliﬁcation and desensitization . Establishment of Growth Site / Polarity Axis As discussed previously , activation of the phero - mone receptoron pheromone binding and con - comitant exchange of G a GTP for GDP results in dissociation of G a from G bg . It is likely that both released G a and G bg recruit proteins that are critical for the establishment of a growth site , leading to a new polarity axis . G a most likely recruits activated Fus3 ( Metodiev et al . 2002 ) , whereas G bg most likely recruits the Cdc24 – Far1 complex ( Butty et al . 1998 ; Nern and Arkowitz 1998 ; Nern and Arkowitz 1999 ) . Both Fus3 ( van Drogen et al . 2001 ; Metodiev et al . 2002 ; Blackwell et al . 2003 ; Maeder et al . 2007 ; Slaughter et al . 2007 ) and Cdc24 – Far1 ( Toenjes et al . 1999 ; Nern and Arkowitz 2000b ; Shimada et al . 2000 ) localize to the nucleus in G1 phase cells , and are subsequently enriched at the shmoo tip on pheromone exposure . The dynamics of nuclear Fus3 are unaffected by pheromone ( van Drogen et al . 2001 ; Maeder et al . 2007 ) , whereas the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic Fus3 signal in the pres - ence of pheromone ( Blackwell et al . 2003 ) , suggesting that export is not affected . Rather , the appearance of a cortical anchor at the in - cipient shmoo tip , such as G a or G bg – Ste5 , is likely to alter the nuclear – cytoplasmic equili - brium ( Metodiev et al . 2002 ; Slaughter et al . 2007 ) . Fus3 is thought to be phosphorylated on binding to G bg – Ste5 and this activated kinase then presumably dissociates from this shmoo - tip site ; shuttles into the nucleus ( van Drogen et al . 2001 ; Blackwell et al . 2003 ) and is also captured at the shmoo tip via G a , result - ing in a gradient of phosphorylated Fus3 ( Maeder et al . 2007 ) . With respect to the Cdc24 – Far1 , pheromone appears to trigger nuclear export ( Blondel et al . 1999 ; Nern and Arkowitz 2000b ; Shimada et al . 2000 ) . Regarding the cortical recruitment of Fus3 and the Cdc24 – Far1 complex , it must be kept in mind that these changes in localization have not been examined during chemotropism . Furthermore , the kinetics of the dissociation of the hetero - trimeric G - protein and of the cor - tical recruitment of Fus3 and Cdc24 – Far1 have not been examined in these same cells , which would reveal whether dissociation of G abg is a prerequisite for recruitment . Several studies suggest that activated phos - phorylated Fus3 at the incipient shmoo tip is important for the establishment of the growth site via phosphorylation of Bni1 and other substrates ( Matheos et al . 2004 ) .

Given that speciﬁc G a and Fus3 alleles appear to be defective in mating partner selection ( Metodiev et al . 2002 ; Matheos et al . 2004 ) , it is likely that there is communication between G a , Fus3 , and Bni1 proteins , on the one hand , and G bg , Cdc24 , and Far1 proteins on the other . Furthermore , Fus3 is required for the pheromone - dependent cortical localization of Cdc24 and Bni1 ( Matheos et al . 2004 ; Yu et al . 2008 ) , consistent with some level of interaction between these two groups of proteins . It is , however , unclear whether G a , Fus3 , and Bni1 form a stable complex or transiently associate in vivo . In vitro , G bg , Cdc24 , and Far1 form a complex ( Nern and Arkowitz 1999 ) , although the stability and lifetime of this complex in vivo is unknown . Furthermore , whether the communication between these two groups of proteins is direct , for example via complex for - mation , or indirect , e . g . , by feedback loops , is unknown . One possibility is that G a , Fus3 , and Bni1 are required for generating actin cables , whereas G bg – Cdc24 – Far1 is involved in restricting the location of actin cables on the cell cortex . In such a scenario , it is possible that the two protein complexes activate differ - ent Rho G - proteins : For example , G a , Fus3 , and Bni1 with Rho1 , via interactions with Bni1 ( Dong et al . 2003 ) , and G bg – Cdc24 – Far1 with Cdc42 , via Cdc24 . Interestingly , G bg has also been shown to bind Rho1 and recruit active Rho1 to the shmoo tip ( Bar et al . 2003 ) , perhaps forming a link between these two complexes . This postulated division of labor , one generating and the other localizing actin cables , is consistent with the observation that , in cdc24 and far1 , chemotropism - defective mutants , combined with bud - site selection mutants , the site of growth wanders in the pres - ence of pheromone ( Nern and Arkowitz 2000a ) . Particularly relevant is the wandering of the sites of secretion and the actin cytoskeleton . Nonetheless , actin cables are still visible in these mutants . It should be noted that this growth - site drift has only been examined in isotropic pheromone concentrations , and should be investigated in pheromone gradients . Naively , one would assume that chemotropism - defective cdc24 or far1 mutants would be unaffected by the presence of a pheromone gradient , since while they should be able to sense spatial information , they do not respond to it . It will also be critical to look at the down - stream readouts of signaling via these two complexes or groups of proteins , in particular the distribution of actin cable and active Cdc42 . When and where Cdc42 is activated in response to pheromone gradients remains to be determined . SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION As discussed , a shallow gradient of mating pheromone is sufﬁcient for a dramatic and robust chemotropic response ( Moore et al . 2008 ) . This response can be visualized at the level of oriented growth and also at the mo - lecular level , i . e . , tight localization of a range of proteins to the tip of the mating projection . For example , after treatment with saturating isotropic concentrations or a gradient of mating pheromone , the receptors ( Jackson et al . 1991 ; Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ; Stefan and Blumer 1999 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) , G a ( Metodiev et al . 2002 ) , G b ( Kim et al . 2000 ) , G g ( Nern and Arkowitz 2000a ; Moore et al . 2008 ) , Sst2 ( Ballon et al . 2006 ) , Fus3 ( van Drogen et al . 2001 ; Metodiev et al . 2002 ; Maeder et al . 2007 ; Slaughter et al . 2007 ) , Far1 ( Nern and Arkowitz 2000b ; Wiget et al . 2004 ) , Cdc24 ( Toenjes et al . 1999 ; Nern and Arkowitz 2000b ; Shimada et al . 2000 ; Wiget et al . 2004 ) , Bem1 ( Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ; Butty et al . 2002 ) , Ste20 ( Peter et al . 1996 ; Leberer et al . 1997 ; Ash et al . 2003 ) , Cdc42 ( Ziman et al . 1993 ; Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ) , Bni1 ( Evangelista et al . 1997 ; Matheos et al . 2004 ) , and Spa2 ( Snyder 1989 ; Arkowitz and Lowe 1997 ; Ayscough and Drubin 1998 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) are all localized to the mating projection . The receptor and the proteins that bind directly to it ( G abg and Sst2 ) are localized to the entire region of new R . A . Arkowitz 14 Advanced Online Article .

The localization of all proteins examined thus far ( Ste2 , Ste18 , Ste20 , Spa2 , Cdc24 , and Fus3 ) in cells exposed to a phero - mone gradient ( during mating or microﬂuidics chamber - generated ) was qualitatively similar to that observed in isotropic saturating phero - mone conditions . Although a range of ampliﬁ - cation mechanisms and feedback loops have been examined for pheromone - dependent MAP kinase signaling , little is known about the ampliﬁcation mechanisms that operate during chemotropism . Furthermore , it is likely that spatial ampliﬁcation mechanisms vary over time , in that initial signal ampliﬁcation events are distinct from those that occur after substantial exposure to a pheromone gradient ( in which cell morphology changes and hence directed secretion play a major role ) . It appears that the localization of the pheromone receptor and associated G abg reﬂects the pheromone gradient . However , it remains to be seen whether the cellular distribution of activated receptor , phosphorylated receptor or hetero - trimeric G - protein , and / or dissociated hetero - trimeric G - protein also mirrors the pheromone gradient , or whether the distri - bution of such activated components already reveals substantial ampliﬁcation . One can imagine that endocytosis and exocytosis are critical for signal ampliﬁcation during chemotropism . Indeed , Ste2 endocyto - sis is required for optimal mating projection reorientation ( Vallier et al . 2002 ) . Such endocy - tosis and exocytosis ampliﬁcation mechanisms would likely depend on speciﬁc cellular loca - tions ( shmoo tip vs . opposite end of cell ) , pheromone exposure ( magnitude and slope of gradient ) , and a range of posttranslational modiﬁcations . Furthermore , membrane trafﬁc could also contribute to ampliﬁcation by affect - ing G - proteins ( hetero - trimeric and small Rho GTPases ) , which are presumably modiﬁed at the endoplasmic reticulum and / or Golgi complex ( Michaelson et al . 2002 ; Wright and Philips 2006 ) . It has been suggested that ampli - ﬁcation occurs at the level of the formation of the chemotropic protein complexes , i . e . , G a – Fus3 – Bni1 and G bg – Cdc24 – Far1 . Ampliﬁcation of spatial signals subsequent to the establishment of the initial pheromone gradient asymmetry is likely to also involve a positive feedback loop comprised of Cdc42 - dependent actin polymerization and actin cable - dependent vesicle transport of Cdc42 † GTP to the plasma membrane ( Wedlich - Soldner et al . 2003 ; Wedlich - Soldner et al . 2004 ) . Computer simulations of yeast chemotropism suggest that ampliﬁcation comes from strong cooperativity and positive - feedback loops ( Yi et al . 2007 ; Moore et al . 2008 ) . In such a model , a Hill coefﬁcient of . 100 is required for polarization , and the investigators speculate that this may arise from the assembly of large protein complexes and cooperative binding reactions . The positive - feedback loop that Yi et al . modeled involves activated Cdc42 stimulating its own activation via Cdc24 , Cdc42 , and Bem1 ( Butty et al . 2002 ) . It is unlikely that this feedback loop plays a critical role in spatial signal ampliﬁca - tion since a bem1 - m1 mating mutant that does not bind Cdc24 and Far1 orients its growth normally in a pheromone gradient ( Butty et al . 2002 ) . One aspect of chemotropic ﬁne - tuning that has been largely unexplored is the process of reorientation following a change in pheromone gradient direction . The ability to generate a range of pheromone gradients with different slopes and average concentrations will undoubtedly facilitate studies on the ﬁne - tuning of directional responses . PERSPECTIVES AND OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS A range of cells and tissues are able to detect chemical gradients , transducing extremely shallow gradients—which result in very small differences in ligand concentration across the cell surface—into steep intracellular signaling protein gradients . These resulting intracellular gradients are essential for directional growth and movement .

It is likely that the ability of a cell to select the mating partner with the steepest pheromone gradient ensures the proximity of the partner and its maximal mating compe - tence . Although a number of proteins are required for the yeast mating process , relatively few are known to have direct roles in chemotro - pic growth , from gradient detection to direc - tional response . Despite the large number of studies on yeast chemotropism , many funda - mental questions remain : 1 . What is the contour of the pheromone gra - dient during the mating process ? 2 . What are limits of gradient detection , i . e . , the shallowest and steepest gradients that cells can detect ? 3 . What ampliﬁcation mechanisms enable the conversion of small differences in ligand concentration across the yeast cell into che - motropic growth ? 4 . What is the ﬁrst protein required for che - motropism that is substantially ampliﬁed ( localization and / or activity ) relative to the pheromone gradient ? 5 . Is there a global inhibition mechanism during chemotropism ? 6 . What restricts the location or maintains the boundaries of local excitatory signals and , conversely , are inhibitory signals uniformly distributed ? 7 . Are membrane composition and barriers to membrane diffusion critical forchemotropic growth ? 8 . How do cells eliminate stochastic noise in chemical gradients and chemotropic signal - ing cascades ? It will be critical to address these and other questions by examining chemotropism both in a physiological context , i . e . , during mating , and in conditions in which the pheromone gradient can be quantitated , such as in micro - ﬂuidics chambers . The ability to carry out genetic , biochemical , and high - resolution imaging approaches in yeast makes this system ideal for elucidating the basic principles of gradient sensing and directional responses that will undoubtedly be relevant to a range of che - motropic and chemotaxic processes .
