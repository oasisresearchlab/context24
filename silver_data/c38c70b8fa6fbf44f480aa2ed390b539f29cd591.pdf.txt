X ammea , and X . elegans ) using PCR - based methods . The complete MAT locus , containing one ORF ( MAT1 - 2 - 1 ) coding for a truncated HMG - box protein , and two partial X anking genes , were cloned by screening a genomic lambda phage library of the homothallic X . parie - tina . The X anking genes , a homologue of SLA2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a DNA lyase gene , served to amplify the two idiomorphs of the X . polycarpa MAT locus . Each idiomorph contains a single gene : MAT1 - 2 - 1 codes for a HMG - box protein , MAT1 - 1 - 1 encodes an (cid:1) domain protein . The occurrence of mating - type genes in eight single spore isolates derived from one ascus was studied with a PCR assay . In the homothallic X . parietina a HMG fragment , but no (cid:1) box fragment was found in all isolates , whereas in X . elegans , another homothallic species , all tested isolates contained a fragment of both idiomorphs . Conversely , isolates of the heterothallic X . polycarpa contained either a HMG or an (cid:1) box fragment , but never both .  2005 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved .

Introduction Lichen - forming ascomycetes comprise almost 50 % of all known ascomycete species . Ascomal ontogeny has been thoroughly investigated in representatives of all orders comprising lichenized taxa ( reviews : Henssen et al . , 1981 ; Letrouit - Galinou and Bellemère , 1989 ) , but mating sys - tems of this large , taxonomically heterogenous group of nutritional specialists are poorly understood . This is partly due to the fact that the majority of these notoriously slow - growing fungi can be axenically cultured in the aposymbi - otic state , but none of these isolates mate in sterile culture . The reasons for mating failure are unknown . However , mating systems can be retrospectively studied by analysing the progeny of meiosis with W ngerprinting techniques . In their pioneering work on the crustose lichens Graphis ele - gans ( Graphidales ) and Ochrolechia parella ( Pertusariales ) Murtagh et al . ( 2000 ) tested 10 randomly selected single spore isolates per apothecium with 30 decamer RAPD primers . Both species turned out to be self - fertile ( homo - thallic ) . A recent study on breeding systems in the genus Cladonia revealed heterothallism in C . X oerkeana , C . gali - ndezii , and C . portentosa by RAPD and AFLP analysis ( Seymour et al . , 2005 ) . These data were con W rmed by ampli W cation and sequencing of a HMG - box gene frag - ment in C . galindezii showing homology to MAT - 2 genes of other W lamentous ascomycetes . As expected in a hetero - thallic mating system , the HMG - box fragment was only detected in 40 – 60 % of single spore cultures derived from one apothecium ( Seymour et al . , 2005 ) . In a study on the potential role of mating systems on speciation processes in the genus Xanthoria ( Teloschistales ) Honegger et al . ( 2004 ) applied RAPD - PCR ( 10 primers ) to the maximum eight sporelings derived from the same ascus , i . e . the progeny of * Corresponding author . Fax : + 41 163 48204 .

Species with few to many ascomata per thal - lus and low to medium ascospore germination rates such as X . calcicola , X . ectaneoides , X . capensis and X . resendei were considered to be heterothallic because they showed diverse sporeling phenotypes among the progeny of one meiosis , and 9 – 66 % polymorphic loci . In Xanthoria parie - tina , a very widespread , ecologically successful and always fertile species with lots of ascomata of all developmental stages per thallus , homothallism was suggested by high ascospore germination rates , identical sporeling pheno - types and absence of polymorphisms among RAPD mark - ers from samples from three continents . As seen in the always fertile , but heterothallic Xanthoria polycarpa , large numbers of ascomata of all developmental stages per thal - lus do not necessarily indicate homothallism . This species revealed low to high ascospore germination rates , diverse sporeling phenotypes per ascus and 23 – 58 % polymor - phism among RAPD markers . Heterothallism can be eas - ily detected with W ngerprinting techniques , but homothallism is distinctly more di Y cult to identify . Char - acterization of mating - type genes combined with analysis of single spore isolates of one ascus can distinguish homo - thallic from heterothallic mating systems . The mating system of heterothallic ascomycetes is bipo - lar ; sexual reproduction is controlled by one locus , referred to as mating - type or MAT locus , represented by two alter - nate forms ( “alleles” ) termed idiomorphs . These are com - posed of completely dissimilar DNA sequences which can even harbour di V erent numbers of genes in opposite mating types . Homothallic species may carry genetic information from both idiomorphs , MAT1 - 1 and MAT1 - 2 ( or short : MAT - 1 and MAT - 2 ) , in one haplotype , or of only one . In Cochliobolus , heterothallism was shown to be the ancestral trait ( Yun et al . , 1999 ) . The switch from hetero - to homo - thallism can be achieved by an occasional recombination event between short islands of identity within the idiom - orphs . Mating - type loci have been characterized in several W lamentous ascomycetes ( reviews : Coppin et al . , 1997 ; Deb - uchy and Turgeon , 2005 ) , including putatively asexual spe - cies such as Aspergillus fumigatus ( Pöggeler , 2002 ) . Due to lack of sequence conservation , the search for MAT loci is still a di Y cult task , especially in species for which no or very sparse sequence information is available , as is the case in all lichen - forming ascomycetes . Moreover , no data are accessible for closely related non - lichen - forming species . However , a genomic library of the presumably homothallic X . parietina was available ( Scherrer et al . , 2002 ) and could be used for our present study , which aims at characterizing MAT loci in Xanthoria species . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Collection of specimens and culturing methods Thalli of X . X ammea , X . parietina , X . polycarpa , and X . elegans were collected at di V erent sites ( Table 1 ) . They were either immediately examined or stored in the desiccated state at ¡ 20°C prior to further analysis . Samples were either used directly for isolation of nucleic acids or for iso - lation and culturing experiments with subsequent DNA extraction from sterile cultures ( Table 1 ) . Due to extremely slow growth only small amounts of fungal material were available , and DNA extracts of these cultures were only suitable for PCR - based techniques . Methods for isolation and cultivation of single spores and mycelia , as used in this study , were described by Honegger et al . ( 2004 ) and Scher - rer and Honegger ( 2003 ) . 2 . 2 . Nucleic acid isolation Large quantities of genomic DNA were extracted according to the protocol of Borges et al . ( 1990 ) . For small amounts and for the extraction of single spore cultures , DNA was isolated using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Table 1 Collection sites and application of samples used in this study Species Voucher No .

Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 979 restriction enzymes , all being 4 - cutters without recognition site in the known segment ( Rsa I , Hin fI : New England Bio - labs , Beverly , MA , USA ; Hap II / Hpa II : Amersham Pharma - cia Biotech , Madison , WI , USA ; Sau3A : Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) . Reactions ( 10 (cid:2) l ) contained 1 £ reac - tion bu V er ( supplied with the enzyme ) , approximately 50ng genomic DNA and 3 – 5U restriction enzyme . After incuba - tion for 3h at 37°C , the reaction was stopped by heat inacti - vation ( 20min at 65°C or 80°C for Hin fI , respectively ) . After self - ligation of the entire reaction in a volume of 300 (cid:2) l with 15U T4 DNA ligase ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) , DNA was precipitated and digested with Nco I ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Madison , USA ) , a 6 - cutter with recogni - tion site within the known segment . The reaction was per - formed with 2 . 5U of restriction enzyme and 2 £ One Phor all bu V er PLUS ( supplied with the enzyme ) in a volume of 10 (cid:2) l . Primers were designed based on the known sequence ( XfHMG1rev , XfHMG2for , XfHMGrev3 and XfHMG - for4 , Fig . 1 ) . Primers were oriented outward on the HMG fragment , but inward on the new constructs consisting of both X anks . Nested PCR was performed with primers XfHMG3rev - XfHMG4for in the W rst round and XfHMG2for - XfHMG1rev in the second . Resulting prod - ucts were puri W ed and sequenced . 2 . 6 . Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR ( TAIL - PCR ) Three reaction rounds of TAIL - PCR were performed with thermal cycling conditions as described by Liu and Whittier ( 1995 ) , with modi W cations . Primary TAIL - PCR mixtures ( 25 (cid:2) l ) contained 0 . 75 U Taq DNA polymerase ( Sigma , St . Louis , USA ) , 10 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 3 ) , 50mM KCl , 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 001 % gelatin ( PCR bu V er , supplied with the enzyme ) , 200 (cid:2) M of each dNTP , 0 . 4 (cid:2) M speci W c primer , and 0 . 8 (cid:2) M arbitrary primer or random primer mix . Nested primer sets speci W c for the HMG region ( Table 2 , Fig . 1 ) were paired with arbitrary degenerate primers AD1 or AD2 ( Table 2 ; Liu et al . , 1995 ) or a mixture of OPA05 / OPA12 / OPD16 . Annealing temperatures were set at 55°C / 43° C for reaction mixtures with arbitrary primers , and 47°C / 37°C for mixtures with random primers . In the sec - ond and third round the dNTP concentration was reduced to 100 (cid:2) M . After each round , PCR products were tenfold diluted , and 1 (cid:2) l of the diluted reaction mixture was included in the next reaction round . The W nal round of TAIL - PCR was performed in 50 (cid:2) l reaction volume . Prod - ucts were puri W ed and sequenced on one strand with the speci W c primer . 2 . 7 . RT - PCR A two - step - protocol was used for RT - PCR . First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 200U M - MLV Reverse Transcriptase RNase H Minus , Point Mutant ( Promega , Madison , USA ) in 25 (cid:2) l 1 £ reaction bu V er ( sup - plied with the enzyme ) containing 500 (cid:2) M dNTPs , 3mM oligo ( dT ) 24 , 26U RNAguard RNase inhibitor ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , UK ) and approximately 1 (cid:2) g total RNA following the manufacturer’s instructions . Second - strand synthesis and PCR ampli W cation were performed with 2 (cid:2) l of the W rst - strand cDNA reaction according to the standard PCR protocol as described above . 2 . 8 . Long PCR The region between the two X anking genes comprising the MAT locus ( approx . 6 kb ) was ampli W ed with the Fail - Safe PCR System ( Epicentre , Madison , WI , USA ) . Reac - tions contained 1 £ PreMix A including reaction bu V er and 200 (cid:2) M dNTP , 0 . 4 (cid:2) M of each primer ( XpSlafor24 and XpLyfor26 ) and 1 . 25U enzyme mix . The following step - down PCR program was used : initial denaturation at 94°C for 2min ; 12 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s , annealing at 64°C for 1 min , with reduction of 1 °C per cycle , extension at 68°C for 5min ; 24 cycles of denatur - ation at 94°C for 30 s , annealing at 52°C for 1min , exten - sion at 68°C for 5min and a W nal extension at 68°C for 10min . Products were puri W ed and ligated into the vector pGEM - T Easy ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) with bu V er and enzyme provided by the supplier ( pGEM - T Easy Vec - tor System I , Promega ) . 2 . 9 . Screening of a genomic library and subcloning The PCR product of X . parietina ( Primers XfHMGfor5 and XfHMGrev3 ) was used to screen a genomic library , which had been constructed with axenically cultured apo - symbiotic X . parietina ( Scherrer et al . , 2000 ) . Plaques were lifted on nitrocellulose membranes and denatured accord - ing to Sambrook et al . ( 1989 ) . Colony hybridisation and signal detection were performed with the ECL Direct Nucleic Acid Labelling and Detection Systems ( Amersham Biosciences , Buckinghamshire , UK ) following the manu - facturer’s instructions . DNA of positive phage clones was isolated and digested with di V erent restriction enzymes . Positive fragments were detected by hybridisation using the AlkPhos direct Labelling and Detection System ( Amer - sham Biosciences , Buckinghamshire , UK ) and subcloned into the vector pBluescript SK + ( Stratagene , La Jolla , USA ) . 2 . 10 . Sequencing and sequence analysis The sequencing reaction was either performed with the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit Version 2 . 0 ( Applied Biosystems , Forster Fig . 1 .

Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 City , CA , USA ) and analysed in a 373 DNA Sequencer ( Applied Biosystems ) or with ABI PRISM BigDye Termi - nator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit Version 3 . 1 in a 3730 DNA Analyzer system ( Applied Biosystems , Forster City , CA , USA ) following the instructions of the manufac - turer . Sequences were determined on both strands . Quality control and contig assembly was done using Sequencher Version 4 . 2 . 2 ( Gene Codes , Ann Harbor , MI , USA ) . Homology searches were performed using BLASTX ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) . Pairwise comparisons , translations and dotplot analysis were performed with the GCG Wis - consin Package Version 10 . 3 ( Accelrys , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalX ( Thompson et al . , 1997 ) and phylogenetic analyses were performed using PAUP * 4 . 0b10 ( Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony ( * and other methods ) Version 4 , Sinauer Associates , Sunderland , MA , USA ) . Putative protein sequences were compared with the Conserved Domain Database ( NCBI ; Marchler - Bauer et al . , 2003 ) to identify conserved domains . 2 . 11 . PCR assay for mating type To determine the mating type of single spore cultures the following primer pairs were used : in X . parietina , the primer pair XpHMGfor21 - XfHMGrev3 ampli W ed a 910bp - frag - ment of MAT1 - 2 . The primer pair XpSlafor24 – XpSlarev25 was used as control , amplifying a fragment of the X anking gene SLA2 . In X . polycarpa , XpolySlafor41 and Xpoly + HMGrev44 were used to amplify a 1010 - bp frag - ment of MAT1 - 2 , and the primer pairs Xpolyalpharev52 and Xpolyalphafor54 ( 430bp ) or Xpoly - Slafor49 and Xpoly - Lyfor50 ( 860bp ) for a fragment of MAT1 - 1 . In X . elegans , a fragment of MAT1 - 2 was ampli W ed by the primer pair XfHMGfor5 – XeleHMG2 ( 370 bp ) . To detect MAT1 - 1 , the same primer pair was used for X . elegans as for X . poly - carpa ( Xpolyalphafor54 – Xpolyalpharev52 ; 430bp ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Ampli W cation of a HMG - box fragment of MAT1 - 2 of X . X ammea PCR with HMG - box speci W c degenerate primers NcHMG1 and ChHMG2 ( Arie et al . , 1997 ) yielded a band at 270bp in X . X ammea using genomic whole - lichen DNA extracts . This product was puri W ed and sequenced without cloning . Its sequence revealed high similarity to known MAT1 - 2 genes of W lamentous ascomycetes ; it was named MAT1 - 2 - 1 according to the nomenclature proposed by Turgeon and Yoder ( 2000 ) for mating - type genes of W la - mentous ascomycetes . The same fragment was obtained with newly designed , gene - speci W c primers using DNA from axenically cultured , mycelial isolates of X . X ammea ( Fig . 1 ) . This showed that the fragment originated from the lichenized ascomycete and not from a fungal endo - or epi - biont . The MAT - 2 sequence of X . X ammea was elongated on both X anks of the known fragment by inverse PCR ( Ochman et al . , 1988 ) and TAIL PCR ( thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR ; Liu et al . , 1995 ; Liu and Whittier , 1995 ) . The sequenced region spans 1 . 75kb and includes the entire putative MAT1 - 2 - 1 gene . The mating - type gene encodes a protein of 351 amino acids and includes two introns of 51 bp each . The second intron is located at a conserved position , within a conserved serine codon ( Fig . 2 ) . The W rst in - frame ATG was proposed as putative transcriptional start codon , not presuming additional introns . Search in the conserved domain database at NCBI revealed a HMG domain as predicted . The sequence was deposited in the EMBL nucleotide sequence database under the Accession No . AJ888227 . 3 . 2 . Screening of the genomic lambda phage library and sequencing of MAT1 - 2 of X . parietina A 230 - bp fragment of the HMG box in X . parietina was ampli W ed with the primers XfHMGfor5 and XfHMGrev3 , as designed on the basis of MAT1 - 2 - 1 of X . X ammea . This product was used as a probe to screen a lambda phage library of X . parietina . The library was constructed with genomic DNA of an axenically cultured multispore isolate ( Scherrer et al . , 2002 ) . DNA of positive phage clones was digested with several restriction enzymes and positive frag - ments were subcloned into pBluescript SK + and sequenced . The Eco RI / Xho I fragment ( 6 . 1kb ) and the included Sal I fragment ( 2 . 1kb ) were sequenced on both strands . As expected , the HMG box fragment was present . To amplify the upstream region of the Eco RI / Xho I fragment of the positive phage clone , PCR was performed with a speci W c primer in the subcloned fragment ( XpHMGrev22 ) and a primer within the phage arm ( T3 ) . The sequence of the resulting PCR product ( 700 bp ) overlapped with the sub - clone sequence , and both added up to a total sequence length of 6 . 6kb . Integrity was additionally tested with spe - ci W c PCR . The sequenced region contained the complete MAT1 - 2 - 1 gene as well as partial sequences of up - and downstream X anking genes ( Fig . 3 , Accession No . AJ884600 ) . MAT1 - 2 - 1 contained two introns of 51 and 50 bp , the latter being situated at conserved position within the serine codon . The position of these introns was con - W rmed by cDNA sequencing obtained from RNA of a lichen thallus ( symbiotic phenotype ) collected in Rosco V , Northwestern France ( RT - PCR with the following primer pairs : XfHMGfor5 – XpHMGrev20 , XpHMGfor76 – XpHMGrev20 , and XpHMGfor14 – oligo ( T ) ) . The ORF of the sequenced clone of the genomic library derived from an aposymbiotic culture isolated from a specimen collected in Untervaz , Switzerland , was interrupted by a stop codon at position 105 , at the beginning of the HMG box . This stop codon was not present in cDNA sequences of the X . parie - tina sample collected in Rosco V , France . Irrespective of this nonsense mutation , the deduced amino acid sequence would extend to a total of 280 aa having the stop codon at the same position as the predicted protein sequence of the S . Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 981 cDNA from Rosco V ( F ) . The two predicted amino acid sequences deduced from the genomic library ( CH ) and the cDNA ( F ) di V ered at nine positions ( 96 . 8 % identity ) , four of which being concentrated at the carboxy terminus . The 3 (cid:1) - untranslated region embraces 412bp , but no match with the consensus sequence ( AAUAAA ) was identi W ed upstream of the polyadenylation site . tBlastx searches ( NCBI ) revealed the partial sequence ( approx . 500bp ) of a gene upstream of MAT - 2 with high similarity to SLA2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a cytoskel - eton assembly control protein . Analysis of the translation product revealed the presence of three of the four blocks of the I / LWEQ module in the partial C - terminal sequence . This domain is thought to posses F - actin binding function ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . Downstream of MAT - 2 , the 3 (cid:1) - end ( approx . 840bp ) of a DNA lyase gene was found in opposite orientation . The results of the tBlastx search indi - cated that the X anking genes were more conserved than the mating - type genes , thus probably enabling the ampli W ca - tion of the entire MAT locus from X ank to X ank . No ele - ment of the opposite mating - type was identi W ed at this locus in X . parietina , a presumably homothallic species ( Honegger et al . , 2004 ) . 3 . 3 . Cloning , sequencing , and analysis of both mating - type idiomorphs of X . polycarpa In X . polycarpa the entire MAT locus was ampli W ed by long - range PCR with primers annealing in the conserved regions of the X anking genes . Prior to this procedure , a preliminary mating - type test was developed for identify - ing strains of opposite mating types : Single spore isolates derived from one ascus , i . e . , the o V spring of one meiotic event , were tested for presence / absence of the HMG box by PCR . The X anking SLA2 homolog served as a positive control . The HMG box was present in a maximum of four samples out of the eight isolates per ascus . As the control with SLA2 was positive , the absence of the HMG product was attributed to presence of the opposite mating type rather than to failure of PCR procedures . In strains of Fig . 2 .

Sequences of 5 . 8 kb from MAT1 - 1 and 5 . 7 kb from MAT1 - 2 were compared by dotplot analysis ( Fig . 4 ) . The upstream and downstream X anking regions were 99 . 6 and 98 . 6 % identical , respectively . Conversely , the regions in between were highly dissimilar , and therefore comprise the idiomorphic MAT loci . The lengths of the two idiom - orphs were 3 . 27 kb for MAT1 - 1 and 3 . 15 kb for MAT1 - 2 ( Fig . 4 ) . The sequences of both X . polycarpa MAT idiom - orphs were deposited at the EMBL nucleotide database under the Accession Nos . AJ884599 for MAT1 - 1 and AJ884598 for MAT1 - 2 . One single ORF was identi W ed in each idiomorph ( Fig . 3 ) . The ORF on the MAT - 2 idiomorph ( MAT1 - 2 - 1 ) codes for a protein of 351 aa in length , with homology to the HMG - domain protein of X . X ammea . MAT1 - 2 - 1 includes two introns of 48 and 51bp , the second being located at a conserved position within a serine residue ( Ser 129 ) . The ORF of MAT - 1 is transcribed in the opposite orientation as the ORF on MAT - 2 and codes for a pro - tein of 350 amino acids . The coding sequence of MAT1 - 1 - 1 is interrupted by one intron of 54 bp at the same posi - tion as in corresponding mating - type genes from other W lamentous ascomycetes . Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a conserved (cid:1) domain . 3 . 4 . Ampli W cation of a HMG - box fragment in X . elegans Speci W c primers designed for the HMG box of X . X am - mea were used to amplify a short region in X . elegans , which was subsequently elongated by TAIL - PCR . The entire downstream region was ampli W ed with a forward primer located within the HMG box ( XeleHMG1 , X X amHMG2 ) and a reverse primer designed based on the X anking DNA lyase gene in X . parietina ( XpLyfor26 , XpLy6f ) . The resulting sequence , 2434bp long , was depos - ited in the databases under the Accession No . AJ888226 . It includes partial sequences of the mating - type gene MAT1 - 2 - 1 and the X anking DNA lyase gene . As the 5 (cid:1) - end of MAT1 - 2 - 1 is missing , the total length of its translation product is not known . However , this gene shows the char - acteristics typical of MAT - 2 genes of W lamentous ascomy - cetes : the HMG box , a conserved DNA - binding domain and an intron at conserved position in the serine codon within the HMG box . Although the total length of the translation product is not known , the alignment reveals that the carboxyterminal sequence following the HMG domain has exactly the same length as MAT1 - 2 - 1 of X . X ammea and X . polycarpa ( Fig . 2 ) . 3 . 5 . Partial MAT1 - 1 sequences of X . X ammea and X . elegans In a genomic DNA blot analysis no homologue of MAT 1 - 1 was detected in X . parietina ( data not shown ) . However , a signal was obtained in X . X ammea and X . elegans . In both species a 430 - bp fragment of the (cid:1) box was ampli W ed by PCR with the primer pair Xpolyalphafor54 – Xpolyalpha - rev52 . These primers were designed based on MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . polycarpa . In both species the sequenced region of the MAT1 - 1 - 1 gene ( 397 bp ) includes an intron of 54bp at con - served position , and the translated products carry an (cid:1) domain . The products are aligned with the complete MAT1 - 1 - 1 amino acid sequence of X . polycarpa in Fig . 2 . The sequences are deposited in the databases under the Accession Nos . AJ888130 for MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . elegans and AJ888131 for MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . X ammea . 3 . 6 . Mating - type tests of single spore isolates of homo - and heterothallic species To determine the mating types of the single spore iso - lates that were from one ascus ( i . e . , o V spring of one meiotic event ) , the newly designed mating - type test was performed by PCR with speci W c primers for MAT - 1 and MAT - 2 . In the presumably homothallic X . parietina , a MAT - 2 frag - ment was found in all samples where the SLA control was positive , indicating that no segregation occurred ( Figs . 5A and B ) . No product was obtained from isolate 1 - II - a - 4 . As the control with SLA2 - speci W c primers was also negative , this was probably because the tiny cultures yielded too little DNA . Insu Y cient template DNA also explains the missing products in X . polycarpa and X . elegans isolates . The mat - ing - type test in X . polycarpa con W rmed that both idiom - Fig . 3 .

Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 983 orphs of the MAT locus had been cloned . MAT - 1 was present in half of the isolates , MAT - 2 in the other half , but none contained both ( Figs . 5C and D ) . In X . elegans , a frag - ment of both idiomorphs was ampli W ed in each single spore isolate ( Fig . 5E ) indicating homothallism with a MAT locus containing information of both mating types . However , all attempts to amplify the region between the two known fragments failed . No mating - type tests were performed with X . X ammea as no single spore cultures could be isolated . 3 . 7 . Comparison of mating - type genes and proteins Fig . 6 shows the conserved DNA - binding domains from the mating - type proteins , in alignment with available homologues from related non - lichenized ascomycetes . In MAT1 - 2 - 1 , the position of the W rst intron is conserved in all three Xanthoria species for which the complete sequence was determined ( Fig . 2 ) . The positions of the sec - ond MAT1 - 2 - 1 intron within a serine codon and of the only intron of MAT1 - 1 - 1 , are not only conserved in the genus Xanthoria but also in all corresponding MAT genes of W lamentous ascomycetes sequenced to date ( Fig . 6 ) . Sequence analysis of MAT1 - 1 - 1 showed that X . polycarpa was 92 . 6 % identical with X . elegans , and 79 . 7 % identical with X . X ammea at the DNA level over a 396 - bp stretch of the conserved (cid:1) box . The predicted partial X . polycarpa MAT1 - 1 - 1 protein sequence ( 114 amino acids , see align - ment in Fig . 6 ) was 80 % identical and 90 % similar to MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . elegans , as well as 78 % identical and 92 % similar to MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . X ammea . Outside of the genus Xanthoria ( Lecanoromycetes sensu Lutzoni et al . , 2004 ) identity drops to 37 % and similarity to 63 % with the Pyrenopeziza brassicae ( Leotiomycetes ; Singh and Ashby , 1998 ; Accession No . AJ006073 ) . MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . poly - carpa was also compared to MAT1 - 1 - 1 of Mycosphaerella graminicola ( Dothideomycetes ; Waalwijk et al . , 2002 ; Accession No . AF440399 ) where only 32 % identity and 60 % similarity were detected . In the opposite idiomorph , the partial MAT1 - 2 - 1 gene sequence of X . polycarpa was 77 . 6 % identical to X . elegans , 74 . 1 % to X . X ammea , and 67 . 6 % to X . parietina over a stretch of 932 bp . Partial pre - dicted amino acid sequences ( 68 amino acids of conserved HMG domain , see alignment in Fig . 6 ) were 87 % identical to and 99 % similar to MAT1 - 2 - 1 of X . elegans , and 84 % identical to but 100 % similar to X . X ammea .

AY634274 ) showed only 54 % identity and 76 % similarity in this short and relatively highly conserved region . The MAT1 - 2 - 1 HMG domain of P . brassicae ( Leo - tiomycetes ; Accession No . AJ006072 ) and M . graminicola ( Dothideomycetes ; Accession No . AF440398 ) were only 43 and 47 % identical , and 71 and 75 % similar . Fig . 4 .

MAT locus structure in Xanthoria spp . and related ascomycetes The genomic region sequenced in this study of heterothallic X . polycarpa and homothallic X . parietina are the W rst complete MAT loci described of lichen - forming ascomycetes ( Lecanoromycetes ) . In addition , partial sequence data is provided for the mating - type genes of two additional species ( X . X ammea and X . elegans ) . An overview over the sequenced regions in the four species and their mating system is given in Table 3 . Fig . 5 . PCR - based mating - type tests with single spore isolates of two X . parietina samples ( 1 , 120 ; A and B ) , two X . polycarpa samples ( 266 , 267 ; C and D ) , and one X . elegans specimen ( 398 , E ) .

( C and D ) In single spore isolates of X . polycarpa a product was ampli W ed either with MAT - 1 - speci W c ( C ) or MAT - 2 - speci W c ( D ) primers . In two cultures no product was ampli W ed , presumably due to insu Y cient template DNA . Tf : A thallus frag - ment bearing apothecia was included as positive control : both mating types were detected . ( E ) Fragments of both MAT regions were ampli W ed in single spore isolates of X . elegans : MAT - 1 ( left ) and MAT - 2 ( right ) . Isolate 398 - I - a - 1 yielded also no product in the control PCR with SLA2 - speci W c primers ( not shown ) . Fig . 6 .

The putative extended translation product is represented by letters in italics . S . Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 985 The organisation of the complete MAT loci in X . poly - carpa and X . parietina resemble those found in all other W la - mentous ascomycetes . In X . polycarpa the size of the MAT idiomorphs ( 3 . 27 and 3 . 15kb , respectively ) corresponded to the length of the idiomorphs in representatives of Leotiomy - cetes , Pyrenopeziza brassicae ( 3 . 2 and 3 . 9kb ; Singh and Ashby , 1998 ) and Rhynchosporium secalis ( 4 . 05 and 3 . 2kb ; Foster and Fitt , 2004 ) . Idiomorph boundaries are clearly delimited ; similarity drops sharply from more than 98 % sim - ilarity to random . Such an abrupt drop was also observed in Cochliobolus heterostrophus ( Dothideomycetes ) , for exam - ple . However , in some species similarity changes rather grad - ually , e . g . , in Phaeosphaeria nodorum ( Dothideomycetes ; Bennett et al . , 2003 ) . One of two alternative genes was pres - ent at the MAT locus in X . polycarpa . The resident gene occupied 33 . 8 % of the MAT - 1 and 36 . 6 % of the MAT - 2 idi - omorphic sequence . In the two representatives of the Leotio - mycetes , MAT - 2 also contained only one ORF , occupying approximately the same space : 44 . 7 % for MAT - 2 of R . secalis and 36 . 2 % for MAT - 2 of P . brassicae , respectively . In general , the MAT locus of W lamentous ascomycetes contains one gene on MAT - 2 and one to three genes on MAT - 1 . As in the heterothallic C . heterostrophus , the idiomor - phic region of each isolate of X . polycarpa contained a sin - gle gene ( Fig . 3 ) . However , unlike C . heterostrophus , the alternative mating - type genes were transcribed from oppo - site strands of the DNA ( Fig . 3 ) . In several heterothallic species with more than one gene on MAT - 1 , the gene carry - ing an (cid:1) box ( MAT1 - 1 - 1 ) was encoded on the other strand ( e . g . , P . brassicae , Singh et al . , 1999 ; R . secalis , Foster and Fitt , 2004 ) . As soon as complete sequence data is available , it will be interesting to compare the gene orientation to homothallic X . elegans where genes of both idiomorphs seem to be present at the MAT locus . The putative proteins encoded by the Xanthoria MAT genes share similarity with those of non - lichenized W lamen - tous ascomycetes . One of the characteristics of mating - type proteins of W lamentous ascomycetes is the presence of con - served DNA - binding domains ( review : Coppin et al . , 1997 ; Debuchy and Turgeon , 2005 ) . MAT proteins are thought to act as transcription factors . MAT - 2 contains a gene coding for a protein with a high mobility group ( HMG ) , whereas one gene of the opposite mating type MAT - 1 is coding for a protein with an (cid:1) box . These domains were also found in all deduced amino acid sequences of the genes identi W ed in this study : MAT1 - 2 - 1 of X . polycarpa , X . X ammea , X . elegans and X . parietina carried a HMG domain , and MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . polycarpa , X . X ammea , and X . elegans an (cid:1) domain . Gener - ally , the similarity of corresponding mating - type proteins is restricted to these conserved domains . However , even in these regions , similarity drops dramatically with further evo - lutionary distance , e . g . , the conserved region of MAT1 - 1 - 1 of X . polycarpa is 78 % identical with the one of X . X ammea at the amino acid level , but only 37 % with MAT1 - 1 - 1 from the non - lichenized P . brassicae , one of the most similar MAT sequences available . Amino acid comparisons over the whole length of the MAT proteins are di Y cult or impossible for more distantly related taxa despite comparable protein lengths ( 300 to 400 amino acids ) . Moreover , in several species sequences are only available for these conserved regions as they have been cloned by homology - based approaches . This is the case in the most closely related , lichen - forming ascomy - cete Cladonia galindezii ( Seymour et al . , 2005 ; Accession No . AY634274 ) . Another key feature of mating - type genes of W lamentous ascomycetes is the highly conserved position of the introns within the HMG and the (cid:1) box . These introns are present in all MAT genes sequenced so far , the sequences presented in this study included . Besides homologies of the mating - type genes themselves , the genes identi W ed up - and downstream of the MAT locus in X . polycarpa and X . parietina , a SLA2 homologue and a DNA lyase , were also known to X ank the MAT locus of other W la - mentous ascomycetes . Examples are Neurospora crassa and even yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica ( Butler et al . , 2004 ) . These genes of the X anking regions appear to be more con - served than the MAT locus itself . As shown in this study for X . polycarpa , X anking genes might prove to be very useful for cloning entire MAT loci of more distantly related species . No X anking genes are known yet from other Lecanoromycetes . 4 . 2 . Mating type loci and breeding systems Comparison of the sequences of X . polycarpa single spore isolates with opposite mating types con W rmed that the sequences were idiomorphic and occupied the same locus . Furthermore , segregation at this locus was demon - Table 3 Species , mating systems , and sequence data Partial gene sequences are marked with an asterisk ( * ) . a Mating system of X .

Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 strated in heterothallic species ( Figs . 5C and D ) . As expected , mating - type locus segregation was absent in homothallic species ( Figs . 5A , B , and E ) . The fungal culture material of the progeny of one meiotic event available for these experiments was extremely sparse and the extracted amount of DNA was too low for quanti W cation . Thus , the absence of PCR products in a few samples is explained by insu Y cient template DNA . This was con W rmed by the fail - ure of ampli W cation of the X anking gene SLA2 as control . In some Xanthoria species , fewer than eight spores of one ascus germinated and the growth rates of the ones which did were variable and generally very low ( Honegger et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , no mating test was achieved of a complete set of eight sporelings derived from one ascus . Recently , the breeding system of three di V erent Cladonia spp . was identi W ed as heterothallic by RAPD and AFLP analysis ( Seymour et al . , 2005 ) . Additionally , a fragment of MAT - 2 was ampli W ed and sequenced , which was only detected in about half of the of single spore progeny of sin - gle apothecia . In contrast to the single spore cultures used in this study , these did not derive from one ascus , i . e . , one meiotic event . Availability of MAT sequences facilitates the investiga - tion of key issues concerning the reproductive biology of lichen - forming ascomycetes . Our present data con W rm ear - lier reports , based on W ngerprinting techniques applied to single spore isolates ( Honegger et al . , 2004 ) , on homothal - lism in X . parietina . Homothallic non - lichenized ascomy - cete species were so far found to have either information of both idiomorphs in one haplotype , or only of MAT - 1 , encoding for an (cid:1) box ( Coppin et al . , 1997 ; Debuchy and Turgeon , 2005 ; Dyer et al . , 2003 ; Pöggeler , 2001 ) . Thus the lichen - forming X . parietina is the W rst homothallic ascomy - cete known to have only MAT - 2 , encoding for a HMG box . No elements of MAT - 1 could be identi W ed at this locus , either by genomic blot analysis or by sequence comparison with MAT - 1 of the relatively closely related X . polycarpa . As shown in the non - lichenized P . brassica , the MAT - 1 idi - omorph may carry both MAT1 - 1 - 1 and an additional gene coding for a HMG - box protein which di V ers signi W cantly from the gene coding for the HMG - box protein in the MAT - 2 idiomorph . This cannot be the situation in X . parie - tina , however , because no HMG - box gene was found on MAT - 1 of X . polycarpa and the X . parietina HMG - box gene shows high similarity with MAT1 - 2 - 1 of X . polycarpa . In X . parietina , the ORF of MAT1 - 2 - 1 is interrupted by a premature stop codon at the beginning of the HMG box . Although the precise function of the mating - type proteins is still unknown , it is very likely that this truncated protein is not functional . This might be connected to the homothal - lism of this species . It is also imaginable that such a non - sense mutation was established because MAT1 - 2 - 1 had no function anymore . A preliminary survey of X . parietina samples of di V erent origins showed that some samples con - tained a premature stop codon whereas others did not ( S . Scherrer , unpublished ) . It will be interesting to further ana - lyse this natural deletion mutation . According to our data X . elegans is also homothallic , but with a di V erent locus organization . We detected sequence information of both mating types in all single spore isolates ( Fig . 5E ) . The exact gene orientation is still not clear yet , but the gene arrangement at the MAT locus of X . elegans seems to correspond to the one in several other homothallic ascomycetes where genetic information of both idiomorphs was found at the MAT locus ( Table 3 ) . However , our data - set on the mating - type locus of X . elegans is still incomplete . As it was so far not possible to induce sexual reproduc - tion in Xanthoria or any other species of lichen - forming ascomycetes under sterile , aposymbiotic culturing condi - tions the ultimate experimental studies on homo - and het - erothallism cannot be performed : The dikaryotization process is poorly understood in lichen - forming fungi . With MAT sequences available , it might be possible to track the nuclei of opposite mating - types for a better understanding of the dikaryon formation in these fungi . The widespread , always fertile X . parietina is the only Xanthoria species in which ascomal ontogeny has been investigated in considerable detail . In para Y n sections sev - eral ascogonia per ascomal primordium were observed , but no trichogynes were found ( Janex - Favre and Ghaleb , 1986 ) . Very small ( approx . 1 £ 3 (cid:2) m ) microconidia are formed in large numbers in mucilage - W lled pycnidia , but their function remains unknown . Spermatization was assumed to be the mode of dikaryon formation in the numerous species in which microconidia have been observed adhering to trichogynes . Microconidia adhering tip W rst and leaving a hole in the trichogyne wall were found in Cladonia furcata ( Honegger , 1984b ) , but nuclear migration from microconidia to ascogonia has never been documented . The invariably tiny pycnidal microconidia of lichen - forming ascomycetes contain no mitochondria , as concluded from TEM micrographs , fail to germinate and may thus be functionless relics in a large number of lichen species which produce no ascomata and disperse by means of vegetative symbiotic propagules ( Honegger , 1984a ) . 4 . 3 . MAT gene phylogeny and evolution MAT genes have been proposed as suitable markers for phylogenetic analyses as they might provide better resolution than other regions of the genome ( Turgeon , 1998 ) . They appear to evolve at faster rates , but nevertheless , intraspeci W c variation is low . The same applies also for sex - related genes of other organisms like mid in Chlamydomonas ( Ferris et al . , 1997 ) . Mating - type genes were used by several authors to investigate phylogenetic relationships in di V erent ascomycete genera , such as Sordaria / Neurospora ( Pöggeler , 1999 ) , Cer - atocystis ( Witthuhn et al . , 2000 ) , Alternaria ( Berbee et al . , 2003 ) , and in Fusarium ( O’Donnell et al . , 2004 ) . However , the use of this region is still limited due to the high sequence divergence in distantly related taxa . Our results indicate that MAT genes might also be a useful tool to explore phyloge - netic relationships and species delimitations in lichen - form - ing ascomycetes . The sequences presented in this study will S . Scherrer et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 42 ( 2005 ) 976 – 988 987 facilitate the identi W cation of conserved MAT gene regions in other Xanthoria species by PCR based on homology . It will be interesting to compare such extended datasets with other loci used for phylogenetic analyses in this genus such as ITS rDNA , hydrophobin and tubulin gene fragments ( Scherrer and Honegger , 2003 ) . As shown in homo - and heterothallic Sordaria , Neurospora and Cochliobolus species , changes from hetero - to homothallism may result from one single event ( Pöggeler , 1999 ; Yun et al . , 1999 ) , but our data set does not allow to resolve such recombination events in X . parietina . Nevertheless , as in non - lichenized taxa , speciation in lichen - forming ascomycetes might be strongly linked to rapid evo - lution of mating - type genes and also to switches from hetero - to homothallism .
