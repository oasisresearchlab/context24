Ramos - Rincón 1 , 2 * , Héctor Pinargote - Celorio 1 , Isabel Belinchón - Romero 3 , 2 and Gregorio González - Alcaide 4 Abstract Background : This article describes a bibliometric review of the scientific production , geographical distribution , collaboration , impact , and subject area focus of pneumonia research indexed on the Web of Science over a 15 - year period . Methods : We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) of “ Pneumonia ” from January 1 , 2001 to December 31 , 2015 . The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews , analyzing descriptive indicators by five - year periods and the scientific production by country , adjusting for population , economic , and research - related parameters . Results : A total of 22 , 694 references were retrieved . The number of publications increased steadily over time , from 981 publications in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 ( R 2 = 0 . 956 ) . The most productive country was the USA ( 38 . 49 % ) , followed by the UK ( 7 . 18 % ) and Japan ( 5 . 46 % ) . Research production from China increased by more than 1000 % . By geographical area , North America ( 42 . 08 % ) and Europe ( 40 . 79 % ) were most dominant . Scientific production in low - and middle - income countries more than tripled , although their overall contribution to the field remained limited ( < 15 % ) . Overall , 18 . 8 % of papers were the result of an international collaboration , although this proportion was much higher in sub - Saharan Africa ( 46 . 08 % ) and South Asia ( 23 . 43 % ) . According to the specific MeSH terms used , articles focused mainly on “ Pneumonia , Bacterial ” ( 19 . 99 % ) , followed by “ Pneumonia , Pneumococcal ” ( 7 . 02 % ) and “ Pneumonia , Ventilator - Associated ” ( 6 . 79 % ) . Conclusions : Pneumonia research increased steadily over the 15 - year study period , with Europe and North America leading scientific production . About a fifth of all papers reflected international collaborations , and these were most evident in papers from sub - Saharan Africa and South Asia . Keywords : Pneumonia , Bibliometrics , Scientometrics , Scientific production , Mapping , Publications Background Pneumonia is an important infectious disease worldwide and is associated with high morbidity , mortality and health system expenditure [ 1 , 2 ] . In 2015 , data from the Global Burden of Disease study showed that lower respiratory tract infections , including pneumonia , were the third most common cause of death , exceeded only by ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease [ 3 ] . Community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) remains the primary cause of death from infectious disease globally , and its high impact on morbidity and mortality is especially concentrated in children under five and the elderly [ 1 , 4 – 6 ] . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) predicted that deaths from lower respiratory tract infections would remain among the top four causes of deaths up to at least 2030 [ 7 ] . Antibiotic - resistant strains have also been on the rise , although resistance does not appear to be related to mor - tality . However , pneumonia is associated with high rates of hospitalization and length of hospital stay . Moreover , it has considerable long - term effects on quality of life , and © The Author ( s ) . 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons license , and indicate if changes were made .

Despite the public health importance of the disease , few studies have evaluated research in the area using bibliometric methods . Indeed , only Head et al . ( 2015 ) have analyzed publications on pneumonia , and their work was limited in geographical scope to the UK [ 8 , 9 ] . In this study , by analyzing scientific papers on pneumo - nia published in the main international scientific jour - nals , we aimed to identify the scientific contribution of different countries to the worldwide research effort , the most cited landmark articles , the degree and nature of scientific collaboration , and the topics addressed . This bibliometric description can provide relevant information for researchers in the field , particularly new scientists , giving a snapshot of strong research areas in pneumonia and global health as well as pos - sible gaps requiring additional investments [ 10 – 12 ] . The paper also provides clues for addressing the weaknesses observed , such as the need to promote North - South collaborations and other research initia - tives with countries that have relatively little scientific development on the topic [ 9 , 13 ] . The aim of the present study is to assess the scientific literature on pneumonia that is indexed in the Web of Science ( WoS ) . Specifically , we will analyze : ( 1 ) the evo - lution of scientific production ; ( 2 ) its distribution by countries and regions ; ( 3 ) the impact of the research pa - pers ; and ( 4 ) the degree of international collaboration . Finally , we will present details on the subject area focus of different publications according to the Medical Sub - ject Headings ( MeSH ) . Methods Identifying the population of study documents For the performance of the study , we opted to identify documents about pneumonia by means of the MeSH thesaurus in the MEDLINE database because this is a detailed instrument for controlled terminology . The the - saurus employs both a human team of specialist indexers to analyze each article and assign medical subject head - ings to it , plus automated processes to improve indexing ; the result is a highly consistent system of classification for research topics [ 14 – 16 ] . The pneumonia descriptor was introduced in 1963 as a disease of the respiratory tract and the lung , and it was defined as “ infection of the lung often accompanied by inflammation ” [ 17 ] . Syno - nyms of this descriptor ( and therefore also included in search results ) are “ Lung Inflammation ” and “ Pulmonary Inflammation ” . Additional file 1 : Table S1 shows the MeSH tree structure for “ Pneumonia ” . The next step was to identify the documents assigned with the MEDLINE descriptor of “ pneumonia ” indexed in the WoS . This body of research constitutes the population of documents for the present study . Con - ceived by Eugene Garfield but now maintained by Clari - vate Analytics , WoS is the top scientific citation search and analytical information platform worldwide , serving both as a multidisciplinary research tool supporting a variety of scientific tasks and as a dataset for large , data - intensive studies [ 18 ] . The use of the WoS databases enables the analysis of all institutional affiliations reported in the documents and the calculation of citation indicators . The WoS brings together the most visible literature at a global level . These qualities justify its choice as the database platform used in this study despite some limitations re - lated to covering non - English biomedical journals [ 18 ] . Although initially no limitations were imposed on our search , to calculate the bibliometric indicators we con - sidered only two types of documents , articles and reviews , as these are the primary references for re - searchers . The study period was limited to 2001 – 2015 , as delays associated with assigning MeSH descriptors to documents mean that information on the most recent articles on pneumonia is not updated . The searches took place on the Clarivate Analytics WoS platform , which includes MEDLINE database , on March 20 , 2018 . Analyzing bibliographic characteristics and standardizing data For each of the retrieved documents , data on the follow - ing bibliographic characteristics were extracted : year of publication , journal of publication and WoS subject cat - egory , document type , authorship , citations , institutional affiliation ( s ) , and MeSH descriptors . Data were then standardized : institutional affiliations corresponding to England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales were grouped together under “ United Kingdom , ” while affiliations in Overseas France , British Overseas Territories , and island dependencies were also assigned to their ruling countries ( for example , the documents signed by authors from French Polynesia , Guadeloupe , Martinique , New Caledonia , and Reunion were assigned to France ) , although regional designations correspond to geographical rather than political criteria . Scientific production from Taiwan , which in WoS is considered in - dependently from the Democratic Republic of China ( China ) but whose status is disputed at an international level , was analyzed separately . Countries responsible for publications were catego - rized according to their World Bank classification by income level : low - income ( < USD 1025 ) , lower - middle - income ( USD 1026 to USD 4035 ) , upper - middle - income ( USD 4036 to USD 12 , 475 ) , and high - income ( ≥ USD 12 , 476 ) countries . Each of the countries identified was assigned to a macro geographical ( continental ) region according to the groups established by the World Bank Ramos - Rincón et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2019 ) 19 : 184 Page 2 of 17 based on geopolitical and economic criteria and reflected in the World Bank Country and Lending Groups ( see Additional file 1 : Tables S2 and S3 ) [ 19 ] . Calculating indicators Two kinds of indicators were obtained : Descriptive indicators for the evolution of scientific production We analyzed the evolution of the number of documents by year of publication and according to three 5 - year pe - riods : 2001 – 2005 , 2006 – 2010 , and 2011 – 2015 . Indicators also included the frequency of publication by country , geographical region , journal and MeSH descriptor ; the rate of growth in scientific production from the first to the third quinquenniums , calculated as the difference between the number of publications in 2011 – 2015 and those from 2001 to 2005 , divided by the number of publications from 2001 to 2005 . Production by country , adjusted for demographic and economic parameters as well as for human resources dedicated to research activities We determined standardized indicators for each coun - try ’ s productivity with respect to : – Population : number of publications per million inhabitants ( population index ) . – Gross domestic product ( GDP ) : numbers of publications per 1 billion US dollars of GPD ( GPD index ) . – Gross national income ( GNI ) per capita : number of publications per 100 US dollars of GNI per capita ( GNI per capita index ) . – Research and development ( R & D ) expenditure : numbers of publications per % of GDP expenditure in R & D ( R & D expenditure index ) . – Researchers in R & D : numbers of publications per researcher per million inhabitants ( Researchers in R & D index ) Data were obtained from World Development Indica - tors in the World Bank online databases [ 20 ] . We calcu - lated a mean value for each indicator based on available data from the study period . The analysis was limited to countries participating in the top 30 articles in the field of pneumonia in order to facilitate comparison between countries ’ scientific production , demographic indicators , and economic development . Results for the top 15 arti - cles are shown in the main text , while those for the top 30 are provided in Additional file 1 . Citation indicators We calculated the following citation indicators by jour - nal , country , and geographic region : – Citation of the publications . Absolute number of citations received . – Citation rate ( CR ) . Number of citations divided by number of publications . – Hirsch index ( h - index ) . The H - index is a semiquali - tative proxy measure to assess the impact of an au - thor ’ s or country ’ s research output on the scientific community [ 21 ] . An h - index of 12 indicates that 12 out of 12 published papers have been cited at least 12 times . In order to assess the differences in the distributions of the publications according to the prestige of the jour - nals , we performed a specific analysis of a sub - sample of publications in journals occupying the top 10 % in the impact factor ranking in their respective subject categor - ies in the Journal Citation Reports ( 2015 edition ) . We analyzed participation in these “ prestigious journals ” ac - cording to geographical location ( regions and countries ) , collaboration level and number of citations . Collaboration indicators and network analysis We calculated the percentage of documents produced in international collaboration and the evolution by quin - quennium in order to estimate the scope of cooperative practices at a global level , considering the whole popula - tion of documents analyzed ( research field ) by country and geographic region . To specifically analyze collabor - ation between countries , collaboration networks were gen - erated for each of the three quinquenniums using Pajek software . To specifically analyze collaboration between countries , collaboration networks were generated for each of the three quinquenniums using Pajek software . The col - laboration network is a graphic representation ( graph ) , wherein the nodes represent authors ’ countries ( as deter - mined from their institutional affiliations ) and links be - tween the nodes represent coauthorships between countries , that is , an international collaboration in pub - lished research . The more intense the collaboration , the thicker the links between the nodes . The spatial distribu - tion of the nodes responds to the execution of the kamada - kawai algorithm in Pajek , which places the most prominent nodes ( those with a greater number of docu - ments and collaboration links ) in the center of the map , and the nodes with a smaller number of publications and degree of collaboration towards the periphery . Analysis of the main topics addressed in research Based on an analysis of MeSH terms , we identified the main research focus of the studies in the area , generating Ramos - Rincón et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2019 ) 19 : 184 Page 3 of 17 density maps using the VOSviewer program with a spatial description of the main MeSH terms for each type of pneumonia [ 22 ] : ( A ) “ Pneumonia , Aspiration ” ( B ) “ Pneumonia , Bacterial , ” ( C ) “ Pneumonia , Ventilator - Associated , ” ( D ) “ Pneumonia , Viral , ” and ( E ) “ Pneumo - nia , Pneumocystis ” ) . The process of generating and interpreting the maps proceeded as follows : – Determination of the co - occurrence of the de - scriptors assigned to the documents and gener - ation of a matrix of absolute values . The joint assignment of two descriptors in a single docu - ment implies a thematic affinity , as both aspects are addressed simultaneously in the same paper . This affinity will be more intense as it is repeated a greater number of times in the collection of documents analyzed . – Elimination of generic descriptors . In order to facilitate the analysis , we eliminated some excessively generic descriptors ( like “ humans ” or “ animals ” ) , along with geographical descriptors and those related to age groups . These descriptors showed very high - density relationships , complicat - ing the analysis and the interpretation of the re - sults , so we analyzed their frequency more specifically . – Visual representation of the network . To establish the main topics that exist for each type of pneumonia and to represent them visually , we used a clustering algorithm in the VOSViewer program , which helps to detect the communities ( clusters ) within a network , made up of groups of homogeneous items that are strongly related to each other . The different groupings , in the form of “ islands ” in red tones , represent the main clusters of the thematic networks , while the chromatic gradation illustrates the areas with a lower density of relations between the MeSH in yellow and green tones . The spatial distribution of the MeSH and their proximity to each other responds to the intensity of co - occurrence between them . All data used to perform the study , including the in - formation downloaded from the database as well as that derived from the treatment of the bibliographic entries , are available in the Dataverse Project , an open access public repository [ 23 ] ( https : / / dataverse . harvard . edu / , doi : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7910 / DVN / 02BUNE ) . Ethical aspects Due to the nature of the study and dataset , it was not necessary to obtain informed consent or approval from an institutional ethics committee . Results Evolution of scientific production and distribution by country and geographic region The search yielded a total of 33 , 944 documents published between 2001 and 2015 and assigned with the descriptor “ Pneumonia ” in the MEDLINE database . Of these , 27 , 017 ( 79 . 59 % ) were indexed in the WoS Core Collection Data - bases ; 20 , 918 ( 77 . 14 % ) of them were classified as articles and 1776 ( 6 . 57 % ) as reviews . Thus , the population of study documents was a dataset of 22 , 694 articles and reviews , which we used to calculate the indicators presented below . Letters ( N = 2213 ; 8 . 19 % ) , editorials ( N = 1 , 998 ; 7 . 39 % ) , news ( N = 58 ; 0 . 21 % ) , proceedings ( N = 17 ; 0 . 06 % ) and other document types ( N = 31 , 0 . 11 % ) were excluded from the analysis . The number of publications rose from 981 in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 . The evolution of scientific production by year was fitted to a linear growth model , showing an R 2 value of 0 . 956 . Overall , the study period saw a two - fold increase in scientific production ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 ) . The country with the greatest number of documents was the USA ( 38 . 49 % ) , followed at some distance by the UK ( 7 . 18 % ) , Japan ( 6 . 97 % ) , Germany ( 6 . 80 % ) and France ( 6 . 73 % ) . Table 1 shows the number of documents and the evolution of scientific production in the 15 most productive countries by quinquennium ( see Additional file 1 : Table S4 for results on the top 30 countries ) . Although the USA ranks first in all periods , its relative contributions have declined , from 41 . 13 % of all docu - ments in 2001 – 2005 to 36 . 52 % in 2011 – 2015 . On the other hand , China ’ s emergence is highly notable , with a 1 . 13 % share of total scientific production in the first period ( rank = 22 ) , compared to a 8 . 44 % share in the third ( rank = 2 ) . South Korea has also seen considerable growth , contributing just 1 . 30 % to total research produc - tion in 2001 – 2005 ( rank = 19 ) but 3 . 21 % in 2011 – 2015 ( rank = 12 ) . Likewise , Taiwan and Brazil have increased their production from 1 . 17 and 1 . 35 % , respectively , to 3 . 02 and 3 . 19 % . Scientific production in different countries and geo - graphic regions , and its evolution by quinquennium , is concentrated in North America and Europe & Cen - tral Asia ; together these regions are responsible for 82 . 87 % of the papers included in the population of documents . Research in the two regions has decreased the proportion of documents from 2001 to 2005 to 2011 – 2015 ( − 5 . 46 and − 4 . 56 % ) . Countries from East Asia & the Pacific and from Latin America & the Caribbean contributed with 20 . 90 and 4 . 84 % of the documents , respectively . Growth was pronounced in these regions , at 13 . 18 and 2 . 52 % . Table 2 ) ( see Additional file 1 : Figure S2 for a visual representation of density equalizing mapping projections ) . Ramos - Rincón et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2019 ) 19 : 184 Page 4 of 17 Number of publications by country relative to population and economic parameters Table 3 ranks the production of the top 15 countries , adjusted for demographic and economic indicators ( see Additional file 1 : Table S5 for results on the top 30 coun - tries ) . When normalized by population , the most product - ive countries were Switzerland , the Netherlands , Iceland , and Denmark . Adjusted for the GDP index , the most productive LMICs were the Gambia , Malawi , Uganda , and Guinea Bissau . If we calculate the ratio of pneumonia publi - cations to GNI per capita index , the USA , China , India , Malawi y Brazil were the most productive . Adjusting by R & D expenditure index , the USA ranked first , followed by Spain , the UK , China , and Italy . In relation to the re - searchers in R & D index , the USA also leads the ranking , followed by India , Uganda , and China .

Impact of publications The citation analysis by geographical regions reflects the balance in the absolute number of citations received by researchers in North America and Europe , with the rest of the regions trailing considerably . In contrast , North America presents a somewhat higher citation rate ( CR ) than Europe ( 35 . 76 versus 29 . 20 ) ; among the other regions , Africa showed the best performance on this in - dicator ( CR 31 . 41 ) , with the rest presenting values of 20 . 07 to 24 . 00 . In consonance with these data , at a coun - try level the HICs ( which are mostly in Europe and North America ) showed higher CRs than countries in the rest of the income categories . By individual country , articles with author affiliations from the USA were the most cited ( N = 316 , 942 ) , followed by articles from the UK ( N = 62 , 612 ) , France ( N = 48 , 019 ) , Spain ( N = 43 , 459 ) and Germany ( N = 43 , 434 ) . Regarding the country - specific CR , Vietnam dominated ( CR 50 . 79 ) , followed by the Switzerland ( CR 42 . 94 ) , South Africa ( CR 42 . 85 ) , New Zealand ( CR 40 . 49 ) , Saudi Arabia ( CR 38 . 62 ) and the UK ( CR 38 . 44 ) . The USA and the UK were the top - ranked countries with an h - Index of 197 ( USA ) and 106 ( UK ) , followed by France ( 96 ) , Spain ( 94 ) and Germany ( 94 ) ( Table 4 ) ( see Additional file 1 : Table S6 for the 30 most productive countries ) . Analysis of international collaboration Overall , 18 . 80 % of the articles published in the study period were written in international collaboration , al - though the rates increased from 14 . 35 % in the 2001 – 2005 quinquennium to 21 . 64 % in 2011 – 2015 . Among the top 15 most productive countries , international col - laboration was much more intense in the European countries , Brazil , Canada , and Australia ( 34 to 62 % ) compared to the USA ( 26 . 33 % ) and the most productive countries of East Asia & Pacific ( China , South Korea , and Taiwan : 16 to 28 % ) ( Table 5 ) . The very high levels of international collaboration are even more pronounced in some Latin American , South Asia and particularly African countries . Indeed , the analysis of collaboration by geographical regions shows that globally , sub - Saharan Africa collaborated on 46 . 08 % of the papers produced . The results for Latin America and the Caribbean ( 22 . 66 % ) are heavily weighted by research from Brazil , but the rates of international collaboration were 63 . 01 % in Colombia , 60 . 94 % in Argentina , and 52 . 21 % in Mexico , while in East Asia & Pacific and South Asia ( and looking beyond the most productive countries like Table 3 Top 15 countries and world regions ranked according to population index , GDP index , GNI per capita index , R & D expenditure index and Researchers in R & D Index b , a Country a PopulationIndex b Country GPDIndex c Country GNI per capita Index d Country R & D expenditure Index e Country Researchers in R & D Index f Switzerland 70 . 32 Gambia 30 . 83 USA 18 . 31 USA 3276 . 91 USA 2 . 25 Netherlands 55 . 23 Malawi 9 . 27 China 14 . 08 Spain 1056 . 90 India 1 . 84 Iceland 51 . 70 Uganda 3 . 42 India 8 . 25 UK 993 . 78 Uganda 1 . 39 Denmark 50 . 54 Guinea Bissau 2 . 62 Malawi 5 . 19 China 735 . 50 China 1 . 22 Finland 40 . 77 Andorra 1 . 94 Brazil 4 . 83 Italy 731 . 10 Malawi 1 . 16 Belgium 37 . 29 Kenya 1 . 88 UK 4 . 67 France 712 . 03 Brazil 1 . 06 Sweden 35 . 94 Vanuatu 1 . 78 Japan 4 . 54 Germany 589 . 28 Tanzania 0 . 78 Israel 35 . 05 Cambodia 1 . 60 France 4 . 40 Canada 579 . 61 Cambodia 0 . 67 Australia 34 . 24 Nepal 1 . 55 Spain 4 . 20 Brazil 557 . 01 South Africa 0 . 62 Canada 32 . 71 Grenada 1 . 35 Germany 4 . 06 Turkey 532 . 13 Italy 0 . 54 USA 28 . 78 Israel 1 . 26 Uganda 4 . 04 Netherlands 500 . 78 Philippines 0 . 53 Spain 27 . 90 Papua N Guinea 1 . 26 Bangladesh 3 . 07 Japan 493 . 90 Colombia 0 . 52 Greece 26 . 84 Mozambique 1 . 25 Canada 2 . 89 Greece 448 . 47 Mozambique 0 . 52 UK 26 . 32 Netherlands 1 . 22 Kenya 2 . 86 Thailand 445 . 07 Turkey 0 . 51 New Zealand 25 . 65 Tunisia 1 . 19 Italy 2 . 59 Gambia 423 . 33 Ghana 0 . 50 a Monaco has a population index of 112 . 42 and Andorra , 75 . 86 ; these countries were excluded due to their especially small size and population b Number of publications per million inhabitants c Number of publications per 1 billon US dollars of gross domestic product ( GPD ) d Number of publications per 100 USD dollars of gross national income ( GNI ) per capita e Numbers of publications per % of GDP expenditure in Research and Development ( R & D ) f Numbers of publications per researcher per million inhabitants Ramos - Rincón et al .

Figure 1 shows the collaboration networks between different countries by quinquennium . The most promin - ent countries in all time periods , occupying central posi - tions in the networks with multiple cooperative links , are the USA , Canada , the UK , Germany , France , and the Netherlands . The presence of South American and Afri - can countries is scarce in all periods . Only South Africa has a notable presence in the third quinquennium ( Fig . 1a ) . A few other countries also “ emerge ” with a high degree of collaborative links in the second period , like Spain , Greece , Italy , Australia , China , and Japan , al - though the latter two countries are not fully integrated in global networks , showing collaborative ties only with the USA ( Fig . 1b ) . Finally , other European countries , while present throughout all three periods , stand out to a greater degree in the third period . This is the case of Sweden , Switzerland , Belgium , and Austria . At the same time , China and Japan seem more implicated in the net - work in this third period , while India and South Korea also gain relevance ( Fig . 1c ) . Journals of publication The documents we analyzed were published in 2115 sci - entific journals .

The journals publishing the most articles on pneumonia were PLOS ONE ( N = 494 ) , Clinical Infectious Diseases ( N = 412 ) , and Chest ( N = 397 ) , whereas the journals with the most citations were Clinical Infectious Diseases , ( N = 26 , 351 ) , American Journal of Respiratory and Crit - ical Care ( N = 22 , 647 ) , and Chest ( N = 22 , 212 ) ; all of these were also among the 15 most productive journals . The journals with the highest CRs were the New Eng - land Journal of Medicine ( 75 documents , CR 278 . 13 ) , The Lancet ( 54 documents , CR 210 . 17 ) and JAMA ( 49 documents , CR = 199 . 71 ) ( see Additional file 1 : Table S8 for results on the top 30 journals with highest absolute and relative citations ) . The comparative analysis of the scientific production and CRs of different journals is noteworthy in that some journals ( such as the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care , Critical Care Medicine , and Intensive Care Medicine ) present a very high CR in relation to their total scientific production ( Additional file 1 : Figure S5 for the top 15 journals producing the most research on pneumonia , plus citation rates ) . With regard to the subject categories to which the journals are assigned , the most prominent are “ Infec - tious Diseases ” ( 17 . 57 % of the documents ) , “ Respiratory System ” ( 15 . 77 % ) , “ Immunology ” ( 14 . 08 % ) , “ Microbiol - ogy ” ( 11 . 85 % ) , and “ Critical Care Medicine ” ( 9 . 26 % ) Table 7 . Many of the most productive journals in pneu - monia also fall into these subject categories . Moreover , over the course of the three study periods , nearly all of the subject categories saw a moderate decrease in their relative contribution , as research articles became more dispersed and made headway into different disciplines producing less research on pneumonia Table 7 .

BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2019 ) 19 : 184 Page 8 of 17 Analysis of collaboration and citation in a top 10 % de las prestigious journals The analysis of the 4100 documents published in the top 10 % of prestigious journals shows a higher participation from the USA ( 27 . 66 % , compared to 38 . 49 % in the over - all body of documents ) and from some other European countries like the UK or Spain . In contrast , the weight of Asian countries , particularly Japan and China , is much lower ( Table 8 ) . Overall , international collaboration in these journals ( N = 1065 , 25 . 98 % ) was sensibly higher than in the overall body of documents ( 18 . 8 % ) , and the greater degree of collaboration was much more pro - nounced for countries like Brazil , Japan , China , and even European countries like Italy and Germany ( Table 8 ) . The high degree of collaboration was also confirmed between regions in the publications appearing in these journals ( Table 9 ) . With regard to the degree of citation , we observed notable increases in the citation rate of the USA and the European countries ; these were even more significant for countries in the Middle East & North Africa , and for sub - Saharan Africa when they partici - pated in these journals ( Table 9 ) . Analysis of subject areas ; frequency and distribution of MeSH terms With regard to types of pneumonia studied , the MeSH terms to appear most frequently were “ Pneumonia , Bacter - ial ” ( 19 . 99 % ) , followed by “ Pneumonia , Pneumococcal ” ( 7 . 02 % ) , and “ Pneumonia , Ventilator - Associated ” ( 6 . 79 % ) . Table 10 shows the number of documents assigned to each term describing the different types of pneumonia ( Additional file 1 : Table S10 for the 30 top general MeSH ) . Table 11 ranks the top 15 countries in crude numbers of retrieved articles , stratified by types of pneumonia ( Additional file 1 : Table S11 for information on the 30 most productive countries ) . For “ Pneumonia , Aspir - ation ” , the main countries were the USA , Japan , and Germany ; for “ Pneumonia , Bacterial ” , the USA , France , and Spain ; for “ Pneumonia , Pneumocystis ” , the USA , France , and the UK ; for “ Pneumonia , Ventilator - Associated ” , the USA , France , and Spain ; and for “ Pneu - monia , Viral ” , the USA , China , and Japan .

The one exception to this was “ Infant , newborn ” , where the highest proportion of articles was about “ Pneumonia , Pneumocystis . ” In “ Adult ” and “ Middle aged ” people , studies most fre - quently focused on “ Pneumonia , Bacterial ” and “ Pneu - monia , Ventilator - Associated . ” Figure 2 shows the subject area maps with the main MeSH terms in the documents on ( a ) “ Pneumonia , Aspiration ” ; ( b ) “ Pneumonia , Bacterial ” ; ( c ) “ Pneumo - nia , Ventilator - Associated ” ; ( d ) “ Pneumonia , Viral ” ; and ( e ) “ Pneumonia , Pneumocystis . ” The principal MeSH term related to “ Pneumonia , Aspiration ” is “ Deglutition Disorder ” , but research is linked to a broad array of topics , including epidemiological aspects ( “ Incidence ” , “ Risk Factor ” , “ Retrospective Studies ” ) , treatment ap - proaches in intensive care , and surgical techniques pro - cedures facilitating breathing , swallowing , and feeding ( Fig . 2a ) . The two main MeSH terms that appear most frequently with “ Pneumonia , Bacterial ” are “ Community - acquired Fig . 1 Networks generated from international collaborations , by quinquennium : ( a ) 2001 – 2005 , ( b ) 2006 – 2010 , and ( c ) 2011 – 2015 The intensity of collaboration is reflected through the thickness of the links .

MeSH terms related to specific bacteria and infections , such as Strepto - coccus , Chlamydia , Acinetobacter , and Haemophilus influ - enzae , are also prominent ( Fig . 2b ) . For its part , research on “ Pneumonia , Ventilator - associated ” seems more disperse , although three areas of interest can clearly be differentiated : ( a ) epidemio - logical studies , clinical protocols , and treatment in intensive care units ( the term “ Intensive Care Unit ” is the most prominent in this area ) ; ( b ) treatment out - comes ( “ Treatment outcome ” and “ Anti - Bacterial Agents ” ) ; and ( c ) cross infections ( “ Cross infection ” ) ( Fig . 2c ) . Research on “ Pneumonia , Viral ” also shows a disperse nature , with different areas of interest . Epidemiological aspects are covered under terms such as “ Community - acquired Infections ” and “ Hospitalization ” , while at a re - searcher level , interests reside in the virus “ Influenza , Table 7 Top 15 Web of Science Categories in pneumonia research ( 2001 – 2015 ) 2001 – 2015 2001 – 2005 2006 – 2010 2011 – 2015 WoS Category N % N % N % N % Infectious Diseases 3987 17 . 57 957 17 . 51 1374 18 . 50 1656 16 . 89 Respiratory System 3579 15 . 77 989 18 . 10 1192 16 . 05 1398 14 . 26 Immunology 3195 14 . 08 799 14 . 62 1143 15 . 39 1253 12 . 78 Microbiology 2690 11 . 85 725 13 . 27 899 12 . 10 1066 10 . 88 Critical Care Medicine 2101 9 . 26 584 10 . 69 742 9 . 99 775 7 . 91 Medicine , General & Internal 2038 8 . 98 569 10 . 41 622 8 . 37 847 8 . 64 Pharmacology & Pharmacy 1664 7 . 33 382 6 . 99 526 7 . 08 756 7 . 71 Pediatrics 1574 6 . 94 437 8 . 00 565 7 . 61 572 5 . 84 Surgery 1091 4 . 81 270 4 . 94 387 5 . 21 434 4 . 43 Public , Environmental & Occupational Health 962 4 . 24 187 3 . 42 330 4 . 44 445 4 . 54 Veterinary Sciences 879 3 . 87 273 5 . 00 268 3 . 61 338 3 . 45 Medicine , Research & Experimental 714 3 . 15 149 2 . 73 223 3 . 00 342 3 . 49 Biochemistry & Molecular Biology 661 2 . 91 143 2 . 62 194 2 . 61 324 3 . 31 Cell Biology 602 2 . 65 150 2 . 74 170 2 . 29 282 2 . 88 Multidisciplinary Sciences 576 2 . 54 7 0 . 13 65 0 . 88 504 5 . 14 Table 8 Distribution of participation by countries in the most prestigious 10 % of journals Country N of docs % Rank N docs International collaboration % N cites Citation Rate Rank USA 1954 47 . 66 1 627 32 . 09 139 , 247 71 . 26 1 UK 473 11 . 54 2 263 55 . 6 34 , 471 72 . 88 2 Japan 132 3 . 22 11 55 41 . 67 6782 51 . 38 11 Germany 285 6 . 95 5 177 62 . 1 16 , 636 58 . 37 7 France 401 9 . 78 3 152 37 . 9 26 , 174 65 . 27 3 Spain 373 9 . 1 4 173 46 . 38 25 , 387 68 . 06 4 China 105 2 . 56 12 51 48 . 57 4926 46 . 91 14 Canada 271 6 . 61 6 141 52 . 03 19 , 291 71 . 18 5 Netherlands 256 6 . 24 7 118 46 . 09 16 , 820 65 . 7 6 Italy 174 4 . 24 8 111 63 . 79 11 , 626 66 . 82 9 Australia 161 3 . 93 9 89 55 . 28 9688 60 . 17 10 Brazil 78 1 . 9 14 49 62 . 82 2629 33 . 7 22 Switzerland 154 3 . 76 10 113 73 . 38 13 , 206 85 . 75 8 South Korea 50 1 . 22 19 19 38 2226 44 . 52 23 Taiwan 41 1 22 15 36 . 58 1568 38 . 24 30 Ramos - Rincón et al .

With regard to “ Pneumonia , Pneumocystis ” , one prom - inent subject focus is on “ AIDS - Related Opportunistic Infections ” and another is on “ Pneumocystis jirovecii ” ( Fig . 2e ) . Discussion Our analysis shows that the number of publications on pneumonia increased notably over the study period , with annual research outputs doubling from 2001 to 2015 . Different factors may have contributed to this . The first of these is the growing research relevance of pneumonia as a clinical entity , as this disease is one of the community - acquired infections with the highest inci - dence and is an important cause of hospital admissions . It is also associated with a high global burden of morbidity and mortality in both children and adults [ 1 – 3 , 24 ] . The second potential factor relates to advances in basic immunological and microbiological research along with deepening knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease with regard to aspects like microbiological resist - ance and preventive interventions ( e . g . vaccines ) [ 25 ] . Thirdly , increased funding has been directed toward re - search and particularly “ proactive investments for emer - ging infectious threats ” [ 8 , 9 ] , and finally , the increase in scientific production could be related to scientific devel - opment and international dissemination of scientific re - search in the WoS databases . This is particularly the case of China and other emerging economies like Brazil , where the rates of growth were highest relative to their respective regions [ 26 – 28 ] . We observed a substantial increase in research world - wide , but particularly in some geographical regions and countries of South Asia , East Asia & the Pacific , Latin America & and the Caribbean , and sub - Saharan Africa . To a great extent , this increase is simply a reflection of the limited contribution to global research that these countries made in the first period analyzed ( 2001 – 2005 ) . The bulk of scientific production continues to come from countries with more economic and scientific devel - opment in Europe and North America ( together , these countries participated in 77 % of all publications ) . Despite the striking increase in scientific production across LMICs , the relative contribution to pneumonia research remains very modest , and the fact that some countries rank highest in demographic and economic indicators may not be a positive feature , but rather a reflection of the scant development in their scientific systems . Furthermore , the increase in international col - laboration could have played a role in these indicators , multiplying the assignment of articles to different coun - tries and possibly inflating some values , masking the real contribution of countries with less scientific develop - ment in research activities [ 29 ] . The USA is undoubtedly the main reference for pneu - monia researchers in quantitative terms , as it produces by far the largest volume of publications — four times that of the next most productive country in the last period .

The other significant aspect in the analysis of how scientific production evolved over the study period is the emergence of China , which in the last period of study ( 2011 – 2015 ) trailed only the USA in research output . This growth has come about in large part from the investments and scientific policies to foster openness that have been implemented over the past sev - eral decades to promote internationalization [ 30 , 31 ] . The level of international scientific collaboration that we have observed in the field of pneumonia ( 19 % ) is below that seen in other areas of knowledge [ 11 , 29 , 30 , 32 – 35 ] . Thus , even though the trend is toward increased international cooperation , rising from 14 to 22 % over the study period , implementing new strategies that favor collaboration is still necessary [ 11 ] . Initiatives promoting research could include those launched by international organizations , such as the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which have both invested considerable re - sources to investigate the etiology of childhood pneumonia in low - income countries [ 36 – 38 ] .

BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2019 ) 19 : 184 Page 13 of 17 carry risks too , as major actors in LMIC research , including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , have been shown to be biased toward research done by researchers from HIC ( doing research in LMIC ) [ 39 ] . The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership and the Global Fund [ 40 ] are also collaborat - ing in different projects related to HIV , tuberculosis , and malaria , and these organizations are largely responsible for the important degree of collaboration between European and sub - Saharan African countries [ 41 ] . Research for operational health services is necessary to improve the dis - tribution and accessibility of pneumonia treatments , including antibiotics in primary healthcare centers and oxygen in hospitals . Likewise , new vaccines still need to be developed for strains of pneumococcus that current multi - valent conjugate vaccines do not protect against [ 8 ] . In addition to programs focused on financing and implementing collaborative North - South and South - South projects , other efforts could be directed toward re - ducing obstacles associated with publication processes Fig . 2 Subject area maps with the main MeSH terms associated with different types of pneumonia - ( a ) “ Pneumonia , Aspiration ” ( b ) “ Pneumonia , Bacterial , ” ( c ) “ Pneumonia , Ventilator - Associated , ” ( d ) “ Pneumonia , Viral , ” and ( e ) “ Pneumonia , Pneumocystis ” Groupings in the form of “ islands ” in red tones represent the main clusters of the thematic networks , while the chromatic gradation in yellow and green tones illustrates the areas with a lower density of relations between the MeSH . The spatial distribution of the MeSH and their proximity to each other responds to the intensity of co - occurrence between them Ramos - Rincón et al . BMC Medical Research Methodology ( 2019 ) 19 : 184 Page 14 of 17 that limit the dissemination of LMICs through the main international scientific journals . The literature has de - scribed obstacles related to linguistic skills and meth - odological deficiencies , which highlights the need to improve these areas in particular [ 42 , 43 ] . Other authors have pointed to the costs associated with publishing in open access journals , so it is worth assessing whether the programs to support open access publishing imple - mented at an institutional level and by publishers such as PLOS , Biomed Central , or The Lancet Journals , are sufficient [ 44 – 46 ] . With regard to the impact of research , although Europe and North America are balanced in terms of the absolute number of citations , North America holds an advantage in terms of the citation rate . Research from sub - Saharan Africa also has a very high citation rate , which almost reaches that achieved in Europe . The fact that these African countries present a high degree of col - laboration with researchers in the USA and Europe , who represent the “ mainstream ” international research inter - ests , could help explain the high citation rates seen in this region . On the other hand , Latin America & Carib - bean , South Asia , and East Asia & Pacific are all regions with generally lower citation rates , although this differ - ence is not so pronounced in the case of papers pro - duced in collaboration , as reported elsewhere [ 47 ] . By country , the hegemony of the USA and several European countries in terms of the number of citations received was evident , as was the lower ranking of some Asian countries , such as Japan and China , in relation to their scientific production . The positioning of China as a reference for scientific production and participation in international research networks does not correspond to its ranking with regard to citation indicators , despite their improved standing over the past several years [ 30 ] . On these indicators , China still lags behind the USA as well as the leading European countries , Canada , Australia and even nearby countries such as Japan . For now at least , the countries that have traditionally occu - pied the “ mainstream ” of scientific research still main - tain their hegemony [ 48 ] . As with the relative indicators of scientific production ad - justed for economic and demographic parameters , some countries surpass the major scientific systems with regard to the citation rate , which links the degree of citation with the volume of scientific production [ 33 ] . These countries may have participated in certain highly relevant contribu - tions , or they may be small countries with highly developed scientific systems , such as Vietnam , Switzerland , South Af - rica , New Zealand , and Saudi Arabia . These countries also stand out for their high levels of international collaboration , which is a factor associated with more citations . The high mean citations received by publications pro - duced in sub - Saharan Africa , and the participation of different emerging countries like Vietnam and South Af - rica in some of the highest cited papers we identified , underlines the capacity of these countries to contribute to high - impact and excellent - quality scientific studies . This result is consistent with previous studies that have also demonstrated these countries ’ capacity to partici - pate in emerging research topics [ 49 ] . These specialists therefore represent an excellent asset , strengthening the human capital from high - income countries and enabling the advancement of research [ 50 , 51 ] . In general , the most prestigious journals show a greater concentration of research from the USA and Europe , with greater collaboration and impact when countries from other geographical regions also partici - pate [ 52 ] . Bacterial pneumonia is the main branch for the multi - disciplinary and multipathological MeSH of “ Pneumonia ” , with the main areas of interest ( “ Community - acquired In - fections ” , “ Anti - bacterial Agents ” and “ Treatment Out - come ” ) reflecting the focus of research on identifying risk factors and assessing different treatments and their out - comes . In publications pertaining to the MeSH “ Pneumo - nia , Ventilator - Associated , ” the main axes of the subject content according to the MeSH terms were the group of epidemiological studies and clinical and treatment proto - cols in intensive care . “ Pneumonia Pneumocystis , ” is closely related to infection due to HIV and immunode - pression . The main areas of research interest for “ Pneu - monia , Viral , ” were the epidemiological aspects related to the setting for the infection ( “ Community - acquired Infec - tions ” and “ Hospitalization ” ) along with the viruses responsible ( “ Influenza , Human ” and “ Orthomyxoviridae Infections ” ) . Finally , for the MESH “ Pneumonia , Aspir - ation ” the main research focus is “ Deglutition Disorder ” . The main limitation of this present study is its analysis of only the documents included in the WoS databases and MEDLINE ( 80 % of the documents ) . Thus , a number of papers were excluded from the study , particularly those written in languages other than English , as well as the proceedings included in WoS , as our searches were based on the journals included in MEDLINE . On the other hand , our approach also allowed us to precisely characterize collaboration in the area , as only recently has MEDLINE begun to include all the institutional affil - iations of the authors . We were also able to analyze the citations of the publications , with a focus on the journals with the highest impact and dissemination at an inter - national level [ 28 ] . In conclusion , pneumonia research increased steadily over the 15 - year study period , with Europe and North America leading scientific production . About a fifth of all papers reflected international collaborations , and these were most evident in papers from sub - Saharan Africa and South Asia . Ramos - Rincón et al .
