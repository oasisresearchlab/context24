Zhang 1 , * Summary Precise actin regulation is essential for vital cellular processes . twinfilin ( twf ) encodes an actin monomer sequestering protein , but its in vivo functions are unclear . In this study , we characterized twf null mutants in a metazoan for the first time and found that Drosophila twf negatively regulates F - actin formation in subcellular regions of rapid actin turnover in three different systems , namely neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) synapses , migratory border cells , and epithelial follicle cells . Loss of twf function resulted in defects in axonal growth in the brain and border cell migration in the ovary . Additionally , we found that the post - synaptic level of the glutamate receptor GluRIIA was specifically reduced in twf mutants . More importantly , we showed that twf mutations caused endocytic defects at NMJ synapses as detected by the FM1 - 43 uptake assay , a pharmacological assay with treatment of the F - actin destabilizing drug latrunculin A , and electrophysiological analysis . Together , our results suggest that twinfilin promotes actin turnover in multiple cellular and developmental processes that are highly dependent on actin dynamics .
