Bausch Received : 13 November 2006 / Revised : 24 January 2007 / Accepted : 29 January 2007 / Published online : 6 March 2007 (cid:1) EBSA 2007 Abstract Neuroﬁlaments belong to the class of cyto - skeletal intermediate ﬁlaments and are the predomi - nant structural elements in axons . They are composed of a semiﬂexible backbone and highly charged anionic sidearms protruding from the surface of the ﬁlaments . Here , the rheology of in - vitro networks of neuroﬁla - ments puriﬁed from pig spinal cord was determined . The mechanical properties of these networks are qualitatively similar to other hydrogels of semiﬂexible polymers . The low - deformation storage modulus G ¢ ( x ) showed a concentration ( c ) dependence of G ¢ ~ c 1 . 3 that is consistent with a model for semiﬂexible net - works , but was also observed for polyelectrolyte bru - shes . A terminal relaxation was not observed in the frequency range investigated ( 0 . 007 – 5 Hz ) , supporting the notion that sidearms act as cross - links hindering slip between ﬁlaments on a time scale of many minutes . The mesh size distribution of the network was mea - sured by analysis of Brownian motion of embedded beads . The concentration dependence of the mesh size follows the same power law behaviour as found for F - actin networks , but shows a signiﬁcantly wider distribution attributable to the smaller persistence length of neuroﬁlaments . The attractive interaction between ﬁlaments is increased by addition of Al 3 + ions resulting in a reduction of the linear response regime from strains bigger than 80 % to less than 30 % . Introduction Shape and mechanical properties of cells are deﬁned by the cytoskeleton , a biopolymer scaffold which can be adjusted dynamically to the needs of the cell . The cytoskeleton is formed by F - Actin , microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments ( IF ) . Since many important features of cells , such as translocation , resistance to mechanical stresses , transport of vesicles , adhesion to substrates and also cell division depend strongly on the physical features of the biopolymers that compose the cytoskeleton , a better understanding of their properties and interactions is needed . While the mechanical properties of F - actin and their foundation in the physics of semiﬂexible polymer networks have been studied in great detail , and in vitro systems with increasing complexity have been constructed ( for a recent review see e . g . Bausch and Kroy 2006 ) , much less is known of the physics of intermediate ﬁlaments , such as desmin , vimentin , or neuroﬁlaments . Interme - diate ﬁlaments show a much smaller persistence length ( Dalhaimer et al . 2005 ; Hohenadl et al . 1999 ) , ~ 500 nm compared to 17 l m for F - Actin . Interestingly , for the intermediate ﬁlament vimentin it has been shown that subunits can glide axially against each other ( Guzman et al . 2006 ) , thus rendering the concept of persistence length more complex than for a uniform cylindrical ﬁlament . The major consequence for modelling such IF networks is that the bending modulus of the individual ﬁlaments becomes a function S . Rammensee (cid:1) A . R .

To complicate the matter fur - ther some of the intermediate ﬁlaments , such as neu - roﬁlaments , have highly charged side arms , which introduce a signiﬁcant interaction between the ﬁla - ments in the networks . Neuroﬁlaments ( NF ) are the most abundant cyto - skeletal ﬁlaments in axons . They ﬁll most of its dia - meter and are proposed to provide structural stability . NFs are formed by three polypeptides : NF - H ( high ) , NF - M ( medium ) and NF - L ( low ) . In - vivo NF proteins are bundled into ﬁlaments , where the alpha - coil parts of the NF proteins form a semi ﬂexible backbone ( l p (cid:2) 500 nm ) and the C - terminal ends of NF - H and NF - M protrude as unfolded side arms with a length of about 70 nm that depends on their state of phosphor - ylation and ionic conditions ( Aranda - Espinoza et al . 2002 ) . Interactions between NF sidearms are thought to mediate connections between NFs with each other and with other cytoskeletal ﬁlaments ( Chen et al . 2000 ) , and alterations of the sidearms have been re - ported to alter the mechanical properties of neuro - ﬁlament gels ( Gou et al . 1998 ; Leterrier et al . 1996 ; Leterrier and Eyer 1987 ) . These interactions could ei - ther result in cross - linking the individual ﬁlaments with each other or in introducing a repulsive interaction by a polymer cushion effect between the ﬁlaments ( Kumar et al . 2002a ; Mukhopadhyay et al . 2004 ) . The interaction between ﬁlaments is greatly increased by Al 3 + ions which results in altered mechanical proper - ties and structure of the hydrogels ( Leterrier et al . 1992 ) . In this paper , in - vitro networks of neuroﬁlaments from pig spinal cord were characterised with rheolog - ical methods and multi particle tracking . Combined data of rheology and network structure of in vitro neuroﬁlament networks provide evidence for the role of interactions between the ﬁlaments in determining the mechanical network properties . Materials and methods Protein preparation Neuroﬁlaments were prepared from pig spinal cords ( Municipal Slaughterhouse , Munich , Germany ) , based on a previously published method for puriﬁcation from bovine material ( Leterrier et al . 1996 ) with some chan - ges to account for different tissue properties : the crude NF pellet was resuspended in ﬁve times higher volume of buffer than in the preparation of bovine spinal cord . This is to take into account the higher amount of sedimentable membranes in pig tissue compared to bovine tissue ( J . F . Leterrier 2005 , personal commu - nication ) . Protein purity was controlled by SDS - PAGE , and concentration was determined by Bradford assay , with BSA as standard . Neuroﬁlaments in Reassembly Buf - fer ( RB , 0 . 1 M MES , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) with 0 . 8 M sucrose were stored at – 80 (cid:2) C . One hour before rheological experiments , samples were thawed ; sam - ples were vortexed three times for 30 s , with resting on ice for 20 s between each vortexing step immediately before rheological experiments ( Leterrier et al . 1996 ) . The phosphorylation state of the neuroﬁlaments was not altered or controlled speciﬁcally . The purity of the preparation can be seen on SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1 ) , where no evidence for the presence of cross - linking proteins in the sample is found . Rheology A commercial rheometer ( Physica MCR 301 , Anton Paar , Ostﬁldern , Germany ) equipped with a 25 mm cone and plate geometry ( CP25 - 2 ) , with a cone angle of 2 (cid:2) and a truncation at the tip of 50 l m , corre - sponding to the set gap size , was used . The tempera - ture of the lower plate was controlled by a Peltier element ; measurements were conducted at 25 or 35 (cid:2) C . Oscillatory experiments were conducted in strain controlled mode . A sinusoidal strain c ( t ) = c 0 sin x t was applied to the sample and the resulting stress r ( t ) = r 0 / c 0 cos d was measured . The storage modulus is then deﬁned as G ¢ = r 0 / c 0 cos d and the loss modulus as G ¢¢ = r 0 / c 0 sin d . Transient experiments were also performed in strain controlled mode ; in this case the deformation was increased linearly over time , resulting in a constant strain rate . Salt concentrations and the total protein concen - tration were adjusted by adding MgCl 2 or AlCl 3 solu - tions and RB buffer . Samples were mixed gently and pipetted onto the lower plate of the rheometer , which Fig . 1 SDS - PAGE of neuroﬁlaments . SDS - PAGE of neuroﬁlaments puriﬁed from pig spinal cord . NF - H , NF - M and NF - L are easy to distinguish in the right column and no cross - linking proteins are evident .

In order to study the nonlinear viscoelastic response of the material , a ‘prestress’ was applied to the samples onto which a small oscillatory stress dr was super - posed . The small oscillatory stress yields a small oscillation with amplitude dc . The differential storage modulus is then deﬁned as K ¢ ( r 0 ) ~ dr / dc at a given r 0 ( Gardel et al . 2004 ) . In the next step , the prestress was increased and again a small oscillatory stress was superimposed . Mesh size determination Polystyrene beads ( Interfacial Dynamics , Portland , USA ) were coated with poly - ethylene - glycol ( PEG ) ( Valentine et al . 2004 ) . The diameter of the beads used was 830 nm for 4 and 2 mg / ml neuroﬁlament samples , and 1 , 200 nm for 1 and 0 . 5 mg / ml samples . Neuroﬁla - ment samples were mixed with PEG - coated beads , placed into a custom - built sample chamber and al - lowed to incubate in a water bath at 35 (cid:2) C for 2 h . The thermal motion of beads far from the walls of the chamber was recorded using a Zeiss Axiovert Micro - scope with a 40 · Objective and a digital camera ( OrcaEr , Hamamatsu , Germany ) . Trajectories were obtained using the Program OpenBox ( Schilling et al . 2004 ) and the mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) D r 2 s ð Þ (cid:1) (cid:2) ¼ r t þ s ð Þ (cid:3) r t ð Þ j j 2 D E was calculated . The MSD of spherical probes embedded in the network is di - rectly related to the mesh size of the network , if two conditions are fulﬁlled : ( a ) for short lag times s , the slope of MSD over s is equal to 1 , which is character - istic for free diffusion , ( b ) for long s , the MSD reaches a plateau . In this case , the mesh size is given by the sum of the plateau ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ D r 2 s ð Þ h i p at long times and the bead diameter . In order to measure mesh size correctly , the bead diameter was adjusted to the actual mesh - size experimentally , until MSD ( s ) curves showed the required properties . Results In vitro networks of neuroﬁlaments were ﬁrst studied by determining the concentration dependence of the elastic moduli . Initially , directly after pipetting the neuroﬁlament solution onto the rheometer an increase of the storage modulus for about 1 h was observed until a stable equilibrium value for the elastic modulus was reached . This initial increase in the elastic properties is attributable to the onsetting gelation of neuroﬁlaments upon addition of 5 mM MgCl 2 ( Leterrier and Eyer 1987 ) . The storage modulus G ¢ was almost frequency independent below 1 Hz for all measured concentra - tions , indicative for a cross linked gel ( Fig . 2a ) ( Ru - binstein and Colby 2004 ) . At all times the loss modulus remained almost constant and an order of magnitude lower than the storage modulus . The concentration dependence of the equilibrated elastic modulus G ¢ was determined at 0 . 5 Hz , showing a concentration ( c ) dependence of G ¢ ~ c 1 . 3 ( Fig . 2b ) . From multiparticle tracking we determined that the mesh size of neuroﬁlament networks depends on the concentration by n ~ c – 0 . 44 ( Fig . 3a ) . This is in good agreement with a purely geometric prediction for net - works , where the mesh size n depends on the concen - tration c as n ~ c – 0 . 5 ( Schmidt et al . 1989 ) . However , the distribution of mesh sizes ( Fig . 3b ) is much broader ( full width half maximum , FWHM ~ 4 l m ) than ob - served for actin networks , where a distribution with FWHM of approximately 0 . 3 l m was observed even for low ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) F - actin concentrations ( Tharmann et al . 2006 ) . The weak concentration dependence conﬁrms that indeed the mesh sizes are probed rather than local moduli , which would result in much stronger concentration dependence . In a next set of experiments we studied the nonlinear behaviour of the neuroﬁlament networks ( Fig . 4 ) by determining the differential storage modulus K ¢ by a prestress method , which is applicable here as the networks are predominantly elastic in their response ( Gardel et al . 2004 ) . The linear response regime extends up to a critical prestress , which value depends on the concentration studied . Above r crit the nonlinear re - sponse of the gel sets in and a stiffening of the network is observed where K ¢ follows a power - law behaviour K ¢ ~ r 0 x with an exponent 0 . 8 < x < 1 for all measured samples . When the prestress exceeds a critical value r 0 , crit , the sample fails and ruptures . r 0 , crit increases with protein concentration ( Fig . 4 ) . In the inset of Fig . 4 , the data are rescaled to the storage modulus in the linear regime . The curves superimpose , indicating that princi - pally the same behaviour is observed in all of them . At a given neuroﬁlament concentration ( c NF = 0 . 5 mg / ml ) electrostatic screening effects were studied by varying the sodium chloride concentration in the solution . By decreasing the electrostatic screening lengths j – 1 from 0 . 6 to 0 . 3 nm the absolute value of the elastic plateau modulus was decreased by a factor of about 3 ( Fig . 5 ) . The presence of aluminium ions increased the low - deformation dynamic storage modulus G ¢ ( Fig . 6a ) at Eur Biophys J ( 2007 ) 36 : 661 – 668 663 123 0 . 5 Hz signiﬁcantly , compared to the samples in the presence of only magnesium ions as a control . Also , we found that addition of Al 3 + results in a higher shear modulus G = r / c which denotes a stiffer behaviour of the networks . This can be seen in the increase of the initial slope in Fig . 6b in the presence of aluminium ions . Also , a shift of the yield point towards much smaller deformations is observed in rotation mode experiments ( Fig . 6b ) . One should be aware that the given concentrations for AlCl 3 do not accurately reﬂect the concentrations of Al 3 + ions in the solution , as some of the aluminium complexes to ( AlCl 4 ) – also . Discussion The mechanical properties of neuroﬁlament networks require contributions of both the polyelectrolyte side - arms as well as the semiﬂexible backbone with the possibly length dependent persistence length of the individual ﬁlaments . Hence , it cannot be expected that existing theoretical models are able to describe the mechanical properties of such networks . The observed concentration dependence ( Fig . 2b ) of the storage modulus for neuroﬁlaments networks is of the order of magnitude that is expected for biopolymer networks in this concentration range ( Bausch and Kroy 2006 ; Hinner et al . 1998 ; Mackintosh et al . 1995 ; Tharmann et al . 2006 ) . The power - law dependence that was observed , G ¢ ~ c 1 . 3 , corresponds very well with a model developed for purely entangled semi - ﬂexible polymers ( Hinner et al . 1998 ; Isambert and Maggs 1996 ) . Models for cross - linked semiﬂexible polymers predict a scaling exponent larger than 2 , which is clearly different from the presented experi - mental results ( Mackintosh et al . 1995 ) . However , the absence of a decrease of the storage modulus at low frequencies ( Fig . 2a ) in the accessible frequency range indicates that the ﬁlaments can hardly freely ﬂow on the time scales measured ( 0 . 2 – 150 s ) . Thus , the frequency spectrum of the studied reconsti - tuted neuroﬁlaments networks resembles that of a cross - linked network rather than a purely entangled network . This discrepancy suggests that the assumptions of the existing models for semiﬂexible ﬁlament networks are not fulﬁlled by neuroﬁlament networks . Both the tube model for entangled semiﬂexible polymers ( Hinner et al . 1998 ; Isambert and Maggs 1996 ) as well as the single ﬁlament stretching model ( Mackintosh et al . 1995 ) assume the persistence length to be larger than the mesh size of the gel ( 1 p > n ) . However , our measurements with multi - particle tracking show , that the mesh size of neuroﬁlament gels ( Fig . 3a ) is larger than their persistence length ( n > 1 p ) of approximately 500 nm ( Dalhaimer et al . 2005 ) . Mesh sizes for neuroﬁlament gels scale as n [ l m ] = 5 (cid:1) ( c – 0 . 44 [ mg / ml ] ) . For F - actin , a mesh size dependence of n [ l m ] = 0 . 3 (cid:1) ( c – 0 . 5 [ mg / ml ] ) has been observed ( Schmidt et al . 1989 ) .

Typical frequency dependence of storage ( G ¢ ) and loss moduli ( G ¢¢ ) for neuroﬁlament networks ( shown here for 0 . 8 mg / ml neuroﬁla - ment concentration ) . G ¢ shows a plateau over a wide frequency range below 1 Hz , indicating that no slip between the ﬁlaments is possible and that the material is a gel - like solid . b Concentration dependence of the storage modulus . Plateau storage modulus at 0 . 5 Hz for neuroﬁlament networks for protein concentrations of 0 . 5 – 4 mg / ml . Values shown here were measured after 1 h at 35 (cid:2) C . The storage modulus follows a power - law behavior of G ¢ ~ c 1 . 3 for the investigated neuroﬁlament concentrations . The observed concentration dependence is in accordance with a ‘Tube Model’ for purely entangled semiﬂexible biopolymer networks , predicting a scaling of the storage modulus G ¢ ~ c 7 / 5 664 Eur Biophys J ( 2007 ) 36 : 661 – 668 123 the stoichiometry of NF - L : NF - M : NF - H of 7 : 3 : 2 and the assumption that every section of the ﬁlament consists of eight tetramers , a mass of approximately 64 kDa per nm can be calculated ( Alberts et al . 2002 ; Janmey et al . 2003 ) . This calculated mass per nm is almost four times higher than for F - Actin . Thus , the observed mesh sizes are smaller than what would be expected considering that the mesh size is directly connected to the total length of ﬁlaments per volume . This can be a result of the persistence length being smaller than the mesh size . The width of the mesh size distributions ( Fig . 3b ) is also much wider than observed in F - actin networks , which can be attributed to the additional space acces - sible for the test particles by ﬂuctuations of the ﬁla - ments , which are expected to be larger due to the smaller persistence length . In the nonlinear viscoelastic regime , our results on neuroﬁlaments vary from what has previously been reported for cross - linked actin networks ( Gardel et al . 2004 ; Tharmann et al . 2007 ) . The slope of the differ - ential elastic modulus K ¢ is signiﬁcantly reduced in the more ﬂexible NF networks . It is as yet not understood whether this effect is caused by ﬂexibility in the backbone , axial sliding , or by different interaction potentials between the ﬁlaments than in F - actin net - works . Recent AFM experiments ( Guzman et al . 2006 ) suggest that axial sliding of the building blocks of vimentin IFs is possible . Thus , intermediate ﬁlaments presumably have to be regarded more like elastic cables and this would clearly lead to a different non - linear rheological behavior for intermediate ﬁlaments than for axially ﬁrm F - actin ﬁlaments . The effect of higher monovalent salt concentrations ( Fig . 5 ) on the elastic modulus of the gels remains to be understood on a molecular basis . The origin of the decrease in the storage modulus is unclear , but cannot be attributed directly to electrostatic screening , since the electrostatic screening length j – 1 is only about 0 . 6 nm even for the solution without additional sodium chloride and falls to 0 . 3 nm for the high salt concen - trations . However , interactions between biopolymers are known to be highly salt dependent . Recent exper - iments on F - Actin showed a very sensitive dependence of the elastic properties on the salt concentration ( Semmrich 2007 ) . Three - valent ions are thought to increase signiﬁ - cantly the interaction between NF sidearms ( Shea and Beermann 1994 ) . Aluminium is reported to induce a neuroﬁbrillary pathology similar to that seen in neu - rological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , dementia after renal dialysis and other peripheral neuropathies . In neurons , aluminium exposure for various periods results in the formation of abnormal bundles ( Langui et al . 1988 , 1990 ) . Both the observa - tions in rheological measurements as well as TEM micrographs ( data not shown ) support the notion that neuroﬁlament sidearms interact more strongly with each other in the presence of Al 3 + , as previously shown by viscosimetry and TEM ( Langui et al . 1988 , 1990 ; Leterrier et al . 1992 ) . In the rheological data , alumin - ium alters the mechanical properties of the network drastically , causing a much stiffer and brittle behaviour compared to networks without aluminium ions ( Fig . 6 ) . In the transient response , the yield point is shifted to lower strain values , while the stress that has to be ex - erted to the sample to reach a certain strain is signiﬁ - cantly higher in the presence of aluminium ions . Thus the sidearms of neighbouring ﬁlaments seem to inter - act with the same Al 3 + ion , which then reduces slipping of the ﬁlaments against each other and leads to the A 0 , 1 1 2 3 4 5 678910 Neurofilament Concentration ( mg / ml ) A v e r age M e s h S i z e ( µ m ) B 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 5 mg / ml NF 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 s daeb f o no i t c a r f s daeb f o no i t c a r f Mesh Size ( µm ) Mesh Size ( µm ) 4 mg / ml NF 10 1 Fig . 3 Mesh size distribution in neuroﬁlament hydrogels . a Mesh size of neuroﬁlament networks as measured by the Brownian motion of beads of the same order of magnitude as the ‘pores’ ( see Materials and methods section ) . Mesh size n scales with the concentration c as n ~ c – 0 . 44 , indicated by the line . Geometrical considerations for stiff rods lead to a square root dependence , which is close to the observed behavior . b Mesh size distribution for two concentrations of neuroﬁlaments ( 0 . 5 and 4 mg / ml ) . The mesh size distribution is wider and has a center at larger values for the low protein concentration . At high protein concentration , the distribution is narrower and the mean mesh size is lower Eur Biophys J ( 2007 ) 36 : 661 – 668 665 123 observed reduction in the strain to yield ( Leterrier et al . 1992 ) . The structure and apparent function of neuroﬁla - ments in the axon resemble , in some respects , those of aggrecan aggregates in cartilage . Aggrecan aggregates are brush - like polyelectrolyte polymers formed by binding of aggrecan subunits to a hyaluronan core via linking proteins . The sidechains are negatively charged , and the structure of the whole complex , as well as interactions with its neighbours are highly dependent on ionic strength , giving rise to a neutral brush regime , an osmotic brush regime and an ionic brush regime with different mechanical properties of the resulting gel ( Meechai et al . 2002 ) . A strong initial increase of the storage modulus ( G ¢ ~ c 2 ) around the overlap concentration and a much weaker increase for higher concentrations ( G ¢ ~ c 0 . 6 ) was found for aggre - can networks ( Meechai et al . 2002 ) . The latter scaling was attributed to forced deswelling of the subunits . Our experiments with neuroﬁlament networks were done at approximately physiological ionic strength , where we found a constant scaling of the storage modulus , but the concentration range that was accessible in our experiments was much smaller . It is possible that the observed scaling for neuroﬁlaments ( G ¢ ~ c 1 . 3 ) is observed in a transition between two concentration regimes . Also the compliance of NF gels in the nonlinear regime seems to be similar to the reported behaviour of aggrecan aggregates ( Meechai et al . 2001 ) . Our data on neuroﬁlament networks suggest that they behave on one side very similar to actin networks , as is shown by the pronounced concentration depen - dence of the storage modulus of our neuroﬁlament networks and by the concentration dependence of the mesh size . On the other hand the frequency spectrum and the relaxation spectra of neuroﬁlaments vary from those of purely entangled F - actin and share more fea - tures with cross - linked F - actin networks . This is attributable to the presence of charged sidearms that protrude from the neuroﬁlaments , a structure with no direct analogue in F - actin networks without cross - linking molecules . However , the effect of ﬂexible cross linking molecules with low off rates in actin networks could mimic the interactions of the sidearms , which could possibly relate to the observed ( Fig . 2a ) small increase at long times in G ¢¢ ( Tharmann et al . 2007 ) . It has been discussed whether the interactions be - tween neuroﬁlament sidearms are repulsive or attrac - tive ( Gou et al . 1998 ; Janmey et al . 2003 ; Kumar and Hoh 2004 ; Kumar et al . 2002b ; Mukhopadhyay et al . 1E - 3 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 0 , 01 0 , 1 1 10 100 0 , 1 1 10 100 G / ′ K 0 σ 0 / σ crit ) a P ( ′ K s u l udo M ega r o t S l a i t ne r e ff i D Prestress σ 0 ( Pa ) K ′ ~ σ 0 a , 0 , 8 < a < 1 , 0 Fig . 4 Differential elastic modulus shows transition from linear to non - linear viscoelastic response .

The storage modulus is signiﬁcantly lower in the presence of high concentrations of salt 666 Eur Biophys J ( 2007 ) 36 : 661 – 668 123 2004 ) . Our data suggest an attractive interaction which leads to the strongly cross linked behaviour of the network . This is supported by the fact that the presence of aluminium ions increases the stiffness of the net - work . An alternative explanation of the observed cross - linking effects might be due to as yet unidentiﬁed cross - linking proteins that were not removed during puriﬁcation of neuroﬁlaments . However , considering the purity of the gel this possibility appears unlikely . Additionally , rheological experiments in rotational mode and in the absence of aluminium ions show a very long linear behaviour , which could not be ex - plained by a tightly cross - linked network . Conclusion / summary We present a set of experimental results on the microstructure and rheology of neuroﬁlament net - works which allows for the development of models of the underlying polymer physics . Network architecture of neuroﬁlament shows a wide distribution of mesh sizes , which can be attributed to the change in the length scale of the ﬁlament stiffness compared to F - actin and consequential strong curvature of neuroﬁla - ments on the length scale of the test particle . The mesh size distribution is thus smeared out over the whole area that is made accessible by the ﬁlament ﬂuctua - tions . While frequency - dependent measurements indicate that no slip between the ﬁlaments occurs , resulting in a gel - like behaviour , the concentration dependence does not follow any of the scaling laws proposed for cross - linked semiﬂexible networks ( Head et al . 2003 ; Kroy and Frey 1996 ; Mackintosh et al . 1995 ; Wilhelm and Frey 1996 ) . In the nonlinear viscoelastic regime , the observed differential storage modulus was different from that reported for tightly cross - linked F - actin networks . It is now possible to compare in detail rheological and structural data of neuroﬁlament and other IFs networks to the relative abundance of data available for F - actin networks . It will only be possible to distinguish network versus single ﬁlament contributions to the mechanical properties of a semiﬂexible network by comparing the properties of networks of different ﬁlament types and by taking into account what is known about the respective ﬁlaments from single ﬁlament experiments . Concerning the discussion whether the interaction between neuro - ﬁlaments is repulsive or attractive , our results indicate that there is a strong interaction between neuroﬁla - ments , leading to properties similar to a cross linked gel rather than a purely entangled semiﬂexible network ( Janmey et al . 2003 ; Kumar et al . 2002a ) . Therefore , an attractive interaction between neuroﬁlaments should also be taken into account when one models the inter - action of the ﬁlaments in axons .

Strain is increased linearly with time resulting in a constant shear rate . The control sample with only Mg 2 + ( squares ) shows a linear behavior until deformations of about 100 % . In the presence of Al 3 + Ions , the yield point shifts to much lower deformations ( around 30 % ) and the initial slope of the stress curve is steeper than in the control sample , indicating an increased modulus G ( t ) ( black triangles ) . Higher concentrations of Al 3 + increase this effect , especially lowering the yield point ( open triangle ) Eur Biophys J ( 2007 ) 36 : 661 – 668 667 123 References Alberts B , Johnson A , Lewis J , Raff M , Roberts K , Walter P ( 2002 ) Molecular biology of the cell , 4th edn .
