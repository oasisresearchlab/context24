CHI’16 Extended Abstracts , May 07 - 12 , 2016 , San Jose , CA , USA ACM 978 - 1 - 4503 - 4082 - 3 / 16 / 05 . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1145 / 2851581 . 2892400 Abstract In this paper we survey HCI research relevant to crime pre - vention technology and identify a research gap towards validating the hypothesis that technology supporting so - cial interaction between users is more effective than pure information - based crime prevention systems . Towards this end , we implement two versions of a crime prevention infor - mation system called SALUS , and present the design and ﬁrst results of a ﬁeld study aimed to evaluate how variations in the functionality of such crime prevention technology can inﬂuence : ( 1 ) citizens’ safety perception , ( 2 ) the local crime levels , and ( 3 ) user interaction and satisfaction with the sys - tem .

Similar to a neighborhood watch group , users of a crime prevention information system ( CPIS ) could prevent crime by sharing information , alerting their neighbors of suspicious activities , and coming up with solutions together . Crime continues to score as one of the top public concerns globally [ 17 ] . According to victimology research , high crime leads to signiﬁcant psychological reactions with negative implications for both individuals and the society at large : fear of crime ( FOC ) , deﬁned as the negative emotional re - action to crime , and perceived risk of victimization ( PRV ) , deﬁned as the subjective evaluation of individuals regard - ing their likelihood of victimization . High levels of FOC and PRV were found to decrease quality of life [ 1 ] , trigger anti - social behavior [ 9 ] , and even provoke neighborhood break - downs [ 4 ] . In the last years , HCI scholars have started to investigate how technology can support community policing activi - ties and to outline basic design principles for technolo - gies intended for crime prevention . A fair portion of the researchers , as well as law enforcement bodies , focus on crime prevention systems that provide users with informa - tion to lessen their victimization risk [ 3 , 2 , 23 , 24 ] . This ap - proach is supported by several victimization theories , like the lifestyle exposure theory [ 12 ] and the routine activity theory [ 5 ] , which hypothesize that a criminal event hap - pens when the offender’s motivation meets the victim’s vulnerabilities and a supporting environment . Crime pre - vention technologies that make use of this insight provide potential victims with information which would lower their chances of being targeted . As such , many governmental and commercial systems provide maps that identify crime hotspots in the city and usually use police criminal records as their main data source [ 24 , 6 , 25 ] . Blom et al . [ 2 ] on the other hand , investigate how users , especially women , can use a mobile application to tag contexts and regions in the city where they feel safe as well as unsafe , and how such technology can be used to alleviate fear . Blythe and co - workers [ 3 ] focus on the elderly with the goal of decreasing their fear by means of wearable technology that broadcasts video and audio data to the police and community sites . Finally , Satchell and Foth [ 23 ] design dedicated safety de - vices meant for use in different environments after dark to help users manage their personal safety concerns , e . g . by sending a distress signal to a buddy in case of a threat . All these studies explore how technology can lessen the victimization chances and / or increase the safety feeling of single individuals . In contrast to the victimization view , the social control theory focuses on understanding communities . It states that social interactions between community members enforce social norms , which in turn shape criminal behavior [ 13 ] . Further research has found that neighborhoods with high levels of social cohesion and willingness to intervene for the public common good ( characteristics known as high collective efﬁcacy ) exhibit lower crime rates [ 22 ] . Figure 2 : Map showing reported incidents in the central area of Zurich . Figure 3 : The details of a bike theft incident . Within the HCI community , Lewis and Lewis suggest that technologies intended to prevent crime should be designed to support communication and problem - solving discussions amongst residents , as opposed to simply providing informa - tion to them [ 16 , 15 ] . Furthermore , a study based on inter - views with senior police ofﬁcers in India arrives to similar requirements for a social media based community policing approach [ 20 ] . The study concludes that the police would like to use online social networks to enable citizen policing by means of self - reporting and to keep residents informed and engaged through targeted and customized announce - ments and alerts . Going further , the same authors analyze residents’ posts on the Facebook page of the city police in Bangalore and ﬁnd that in addition to actionable informa - tion , online social networks can help assess FOC among residents and develop mutual accountability between police and the residents [ 21 ] . While the above research identiﬁes the potential and promises of community policing technology , a fully - ﬂedged CPIS is yet to be built , and its effects in terms of increasing collec - tive efﬁcacy and of lowering FOC and PRV levels , is yet to be measured . Of special interest is quantitatively testing the hypothesis that the integration of social features within a CPIS would yield better results than a pure information - based CPIS . In the remainder of the paper we : ( 1 ) derive speciﬁc re - search questions to quantify the above hypothesis , ( 2 ) present a ﬁeld study aiming to empirically measure the an - swers to the identiﬁed questions , and ( 3 ) design and im - plement two versions of a mobile application to gather the empirical data during the study . Research Questions To investigate the research gap identiﬁed above , we imple - ment and evaluate two versions of a CPIS ( an information - based basic version and an extended version allowing com - munication and interaction between users ) and seek to an - swer the following two research questions : RQ1 . Within a CPIS , is enabling social interaction among individuals more effective than only providing crime - related information in terms of reducing : ( 1 ) FOC , ( 2 ) PRV , and ( 3 ) real crime levels ? RQ2 . General understanding of the usage and user inter - action with the proposed CPIS versions . Speciﬁcally , ana - lyzing the two deployments in terms of : ( 1 ) how do users interact with the system , i . e . what are the most popular fea - tures and use cases ? , ( 2 ) when , how often , and for how long do users interact with the system ? , and ( 3 ) what are users motivations for content generation and consumption ? Study Design The study phases are depicted in Figure 1 in chronological order . We ﬁrst surveyed relevant research streams in the areas of HCI and victimology , identiﬁed research opportuni - ties , and continued with the design and implementation of two versions of a crime prevention app ( presented in detail in the next section ) . The two CPIS have been deployed to users in the city of Zurich , Switzerland , with a planned usage period of 3 months , starting October 15th 2015 . At the time of writing the study is still ongoing . To acquire users , we have lead a multi - channel campaign . Potential participants in three different neighborhoods of the city have been contacted via an ofﬁ - cial university letter brieﬂy describing the aim of the study and asking for their participation . In addition , promotional material in form of ﬂyers , posters , study website , and social media campaigns was disseminated 1 . Figure 4 : List showing last reported incidents received by the user . Figure 5 : A list of prevention tips against bike theft . Respondents were asked to ﬁll in an initial survey , designed to capture their current safety perception , previous victim - ization , socio - demographic data , housing situation , and de - gree of neighborhood integration . FOC was operationalized by means of the following three questions [ 10 ] : How safe do you feel walking alone in your area after dark ? ( FOC1 ) , A relative or close friend of yours walks alone in your area after dark . How safe do you think this is ? ( FOC2 ) , and How safe do you feel when you are home alone after dark ? ( FOC3 ) , each measured on a four - point Likert scale ( 1 - very safe , 2 - relatively safe , 3 - a bit unsafe , 4 - very unsafe ) . PRV was measured for different types of offenses , over a binary answer scale ( yes or no ) as follows : Do you think it is probable that over the next 12 months you will be a victim of the following offenses ? ( a ) Personal theft , ( b ) bike theft , ( c ) car theft , ( d ) burglary , and ( e ) other . ( PRV ) [ 14 ] . At the end of this ﬁrst survey , the participants were as - signed randomly to two different treatment groups , based on which they have received the download link to one of the two following versions of the app . V1 . Information only : users receiving this version of the app have access to a common set of features on the platform , but no possibility for communication with other users . V2 . Social : addition - ally to all features provided to the group above , users in this group have the possibility to exchange information with the other users via additional functionality – explained in the next section . 1 See our project homepage : http : / / salusapp . ch Upon completion of the test period of 3 months , users will be contacted again and asked to ﬁll in a ﬁnal survey , newly assessing their safety perception via the same operational - izations presented above . Additionally , users will be asked to rate the app functionality and to indicate their motivations for content generation and consumption on the platform . The answers from both surveys will then be compared to assess if and how the two app deployments have had an effect on the research questions RQ1 and RQ2 . CPIS Design and Implementation Based on the insights from an ideation workshop , usabil - ity surveys of two prototypes , and from several literature streams , the authors have already identiﬁed a list of six CPIS design principles ( DP ) in a previous publication [ 8 ] . Next to identifying key design principles for CPIS , this pre - vious work proves that a CPIS would not spread panic among its users , but instead , it holds a potential to de - crease the risk of victimization and to motivate its users to undertake preventive measures . In this work , we have chosen the following four core design principles for imple - mentation in our ﬁrst CPIS in the wild : DP1 . Information provision : through crime mapping , to establish transparency and raise exposure awareness among individuals . DP2 . Community involvement : through sharing informa - tion and advice among community members , to build and strengthen social ties within the community . DP3 . Preventive tips provision : a supportive function of the system for promoting preventive behavior among users and counterbalancing the provision of crime related infor - mation ( which might be perceived as negative ) . DP4 . Targeted notiﬁcations : through warnings in times of high risk , a mechanism to keep users engaged and return - ing to the system . The two versions of the system were developed in form of two separate deployments of an Android mobile applica - tion named SALUS , after the Greek goddess of safety and well - being 2 . Both versions provide functionality across four main use cases ( UC ) , that map closely to the design prin - ciples identiﬁed above , and are explained in detail below . They solely differ in the implementation of UC2 , which in the SALUS social deployment contains additional social features .

UC1 . Visualize crime related information To avoid the cold - start problem , typical for new crowdsourc - ing applications where lack of content leads to lack of users and vice versa , trustworthy crime statistics originating from ofﬁcial police criminal records [ 18 ] have been used . Visual - ization of these statistics is achieved via a choropleth map 3 , supporting two levels of aggregation : on municipality level and on district level . The absolute number of criminal in - cidents has been normalized to the number of inhabitants in the geographical unit , and provides a static information reﬂecting the overall crime level from the previous year . On top of this , an additional layer consists of crowdsourced data in form of individual incidents . Each incident is repre - sented by a pin on the map , with different pin colors repre - senting different crime types ( see UC2 ) . By tapping onto a pin , a summary of the incident is provided . A printscreen of UC1 is provided in Figure 2 . This use case is identical in both SALUS versions . 2 See Wikipedia : https : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Salus 3 See Wikipedia : https : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Choropleth _ map UC2 . Share incidents Common features . Users of both treatment groups are able to report crime incidents themselves . This is achieved in the map view by tapping over the incident location , or by creat - ing an incident from scratch and typing in its exact address . Users can choose from six incident types : vehicle theft , bike theft , pickpocketing , vandalism ( like littering or grafﬁti ) , and suspicious behaviour ( like strong yelling ) – the prevalent non - violent criminal acts that plague cities across the world . Additional details are required to complete the reporting : date , time , textual description , and an optional photo . Features speciﬁc to SALUS social . To investigate the posed research questions and to promote the feeling of a digi - tal crime watch community among users , following addi - tional features have been implemented in the extended version . First , users are able to interact over the reported incidents by : thanking the author for sharing an incident , by commenting under an incident , or by liking a comment . For each incident : the numbers of thanks , comments , and of users that saw it are summarized . Furthermore , at any given time , a user in the social group can see the current number of online users in her proximity – a parameter set to a radius of 4km , the upper limit for walkable distance . For an example of a real report in the social productive deploy - ment , please refer to Figure 3 , where the social features present in that screen are highlighted in yellow . UC3 . Receive notiﬁcations Each time a crime incident is reported a real - time push no - tiﬁcation is sent to all users in the city . Upon tapping on a notiﬁcation , the user is redirected to the report details within SALUS . All received notiﬁcations , are accessible in a form of a list , sorted based on recency , and marked as seen / unseen – see Figure 4 . From this list view , the user can open the details of any incident . This use case has the same implementation in both app deployments . Figure 6 : Distribution of fear levels across the three questions measuring FOC . Figure 7 : Distribution of PRV across the four polled crime types . UC4 . Get prevention tips To provide richer and actionable content for the cold - start of the app , a static list of 55 prevention tips has been com - piled from authoritative sources , like the Swiss Crime Pre - vention [ 19 ] . The tips span across the same six criminal categories as the incidents , leading to a 1 - to - 1 mapping from the incident type to a prevention tip type and enabling the linking of all relevant tips within the report detailed view . Figure 5 shows the ﬁrst prevention tip for protection against bike theft . Users from both treatment groups have access to the same prevention tips . Non - functional requirements In order to prevent misuse , users are able to mark each incident as spam / inappropriate . This triggers an email no - tiﬁcation to the administrators , which are then able to block the originating user and / or remove the incident . To assure their and other’s privacy , users are identiﬁed by nicknames instead of real names or email addresses , and are advised not to upload pictures of other persons or with disturbing content . Furthermore , app usage of both deployments is tracked using Google Analytics [ 11 ] , providing usage statis - tics to be compared and contrasted at the end of the study . Preliminary Results and Future Work As at the time of writing SALUS is still in use by the users , we choose to share some ﬁrst insights from the initial sur - vey ( related to RQ1 ) and from the app’s main features ( as part of RQ2 ) . 117 participants residing in the study area completed the ﬁrst survey , whereby 51 . 3 % ( 60 ) downloaded the informa - tion only and 48 . 7 % ( 57 ) the social application . Among the participants , the majority are men ( 70 . 9 % ) , between the ages of 15 - 39 ( 71 . 8 % ) or 40 - 64 ( 24 . 8 % ) , and of Swiss na - tionality ( 60 . 7 % ) . The vast majority live in an apartment ( 97 . 4 % ) as a tenant ( 91 . 5 % ) . They either : live with their family but without children ( 29 . 9 % ) , alone ( 27 . 4 % ) , with their family and children ( 20 . 5 % ) or in a shared apartment ( 22 . 2 % ) . Most participants report greeting their neighbors in the hallway ( 64 . 1 % ) , while 26 . 5 % chat with their neighbors regularly . Figure 6 shows the distribution of the FOC1 , FOC2 , FOC3 variables , yielding in a high safety feeling among the partic - ipants at the time they have downloaded the app . In detail , between 50 . 0 % to 75 . 0 % of participants feel very safe fol - lowed by 21 . 3 % to 39 . 8 % of participants feeling fairly safe . No participants have admitted to feel very unsafe . On the other hand , the reported levels of PRV are high – see Fig - ure 7 . Up to 45 . 5 % of the participants think their bike could get stolen within the next year , followed by 23 . 1 % perceived risk of personal theft , and 12 % perceived risk of burglary . Table 1 presents the main SALUS screens ordered by their popularity as of January 11th 2016 . While it was to be ex - pected that crime incidents information is most popular ( list view , map view , and details view scoring in total 66 . 07 % ) , the very low hit rate of 1 . 34 % scored by the prevention tips view comes as a surprise , as the authors found in a previ - ous usability study [ 7 ] that this use case would be perceived as most useful . This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the link provided in the incident details view was not salient enough . Natural next steps are : completion of the ﬁnal survey , full evaluation of the tracked usage data , comparison of the safety perception information collected by the two surveys , and evaluation of the local crime statistics – all to fully an - swer the addressed research questions . With this we aim to enrich the existing HCI body of knowledge and inform the design of next - generation CPIS . References [ 1 ] Jon Bannister and Nick Fyfe . 2001 .
