For this reason , they are widely used by textbook authors or science teachers for different aims such as introduction , clarification , or discrimination of new concepts . This study examines the analogies used in elementary science textbooks from 3rd to 8th grades and criticizes the use of analogies . By considering Glynn ’ s teaching - with - analogies approach , this study identifies the missing parts of the analogies that should be revised and presents examples of how textbook analogies could be improved by teachers in teaching physics concepts .

INTRODUCTION Science educators need various practical teaching tech - niques when teaching science . “ Analogies ” are important in science teaching , with analogy being a practical technique [ 1 ] explaining unknown phenomena using the properties of known phenomena by making comparisons [ 2 ] . Known phenomena are termed “ analog ” and unknown ones are referred to as “ target ” [ 3 , 4 ] . Analog and target share some common characteristics called “ attributes ” [ 5 ] , which allow the construction of relationships . In this manner , similar - ities are presented by comparing known A ( analog ) with unknown B ( target ) , a process referred to as “ mapping ” [ 5 ] . At that point , analogies are considered an instructional technique in determining meaningful relationships between prior and new knowledge [ 1 ] . Throughout the history of science , analogies have been used to understand new concepts and explain them to others . For example , the “ plum pudding ” analogy of Thomson or the “ solar system ” analogy of Rutherford to describe an “ atom ” had important roles in the under - standing and teaching of atoms . While Stephen Hawking used approximately 70 analogies in his book A Brief History of Time to explain astrophysics and quantum ideas , many scientists such as Oppenheimer , Maxwell , Boyle , Huygens , and Kekule contributed to the development of science by using analogical thinking in their discoveries [ 6 ] . Analogies can be used to understand difficult concepts and to make abstract concepts more concrete [ 7 ] . The use of analogies in the teaching of abstract and difficult concepts may help students ’ conceptualization ; however , analogies are considered double - edged swords — if not used carefully , they may cause misconceptions [ 6 , 8 – 11 ] , particularly when the analogy breaks ( i . e . , when the analog and target do not share similar features ) , students may transfer dissimilar parts of the analogies to their learning and consequently misunderstand taught concepts [ 12 ] . Thus , not only is it important to consider which analogies are used in the teaching of scientific concepts , but also how analogies are constructed and used in textbooks and science classes . The literature is rich in analogy use in science . Research regarding analogies can be categorized as ( i ) use of analogies in science classes and conceptual learning [ 1 , 8 , 13 – 16 ] , ( ii ) use of analogies in science textbooks [ 5 , 17 – 21 ] , ( iii ) dif - ferent approaches in analogy use in science classes [ 4 , 5 , 22 – 26 ] , ( iv ) knowledge and opinions of science educators about analogies and their use [ 25 , 27 – 31 ] , ( v ) knowledge and opinions of students about analogies and their use [ 32 – 35 ] , and ( vi ) new analogies constructed by science educators [ 8 , 36 – 38 ] . Among these categories , the second category is studied with the analyses of textbooks of different disci - plines such as chemistry , biochemistry , and physics and with different grade levels such as elementary , secondary , and university levels . While these analyses indicated variation in the average number of the analogies per textbook and presented the analogy use with different properties [ 5 , 17 – 21 ] , Orgill and Bodner explained that limitations of analogies were common for science textbooks examined for the use of analogies [ 20 ] . Teaching - with - analogies ( TWA ) , proposed by Glynn [ 22 ] , is a well - known systematic approach concerning analogy use in science classes . In this method , the target is first introduced . Then , students ’ knowledge regarding the analog is examined and they are reminded of this analog .

PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH 15 , 010109 ( 2019 ) 2469 - 9896 = 19 = 15 ( 1 ) = 010109 ( 8 ) 010109 - 1 Published by the American Physical Society similarities between target and analog are mapped . Finally , a conclusion is drawn for the target and dissimilarities between analog and target are examined [ 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 22 – 25 ] . The order of the last two steps of this approach are sometimes exchanged ( i . e . , first examination of dissimi - larities between analog and target occurs , then arriving at a conclusion about the target [ 4 , 23 ] ) . Revision of the “ family relationship analogy ” [ 8 ] that was used by a physics professor in an undergraduate level modern physics course can be an example for the implementation of TWA . This analogy was a spontaneously constructed analogy in the teaching of a quantum view of photoelectron emission from the metal surface and also aimed to discriminate classical and quantum viewpoints . Presentation of this analogy with TWA steps [ 23 ] is presented in Fig . 1 . As seen in Fig . 1 , three issues commonly occur with respect to analogy use in science classes with Glynn ’ s TWA approach : ( i ) pretopic orientation , involving explanation of the analog and a strategy indicating the analogical nature , ( ii ) level of enrichment , which is the richness of mapping between analog and target , and ( iii ) limitation of the analogy , which provides an explanation of dissimilarities between analog and target [ 4 , 5 , 22 , 23 , 25 ] . Pretopic orientation is important because in some cases students may have problems when relating analog and target [ 39 ] , potentially visualizing analogs differently than the teacher had explained them ( particularly analogs not familiar to students ) , and this causes misconceptions [ 24 ] . Mapping between analog and target is fundamental as the analogy is constructed because it presents similar attributes between both , indicates the relationship , and explains why the analog and target are similar [ 5 , 25 ] . Although analogies share common attributes , the analog and target are different and have varying attributes . Limitations of analogies correspond to their dissimilar characteristics . It is important to mention these limitations as well as common attributes between both analog and target when analogies are con - structed [ 11 , 12 , 24 ] . As well as the use of analogy in science teaching , it is important to identify how it is used . Hence , in this study , we focus on analogies used in elementary science textbooks . With the identification of the analogies used for teaching physics , chemistry , biology , and engineering , we also have a chance to compare the qualities of analogies for these domains . Then , we discuss how analogies can be improved for teaching physics subjects . II . METHODOLOGY For this study , six science textbooks from 3rd to 8th grades approved for use in the 2017 – 2018 academic year by the Ministry of Education in Turkey were subjected to FIG . 1 . An analogy with TWA steps for the photoelectron emission . This analogy , named the family relationship analogy , was originally presented in Didi ş ’ s [ 8 ] study investigating the analogies used in the teaching of introductory quantum theory . While the quoted parts were taken directly from Didi ş [ 8 ] , a relevant text was added to improve the analogy by TWA steps . D İ D İŞ KÖRHASAN and HIDIR PHYS . REV . PHYS . EDUC . RES . 15 , 010109 ( 2019 ) 010109 - 2 content analysis [ 40 ] . Then , analogies used in the textbooks were identified . Content analysis is a systematic and repeatable tech - nique summarizing both written materials such as books , letters , and newspapers and visual materials such as videos and photographs based on specific coding categories [ 40 ] . For this reason , it was the best suited analysis for this research . In the analysis , the steps given in Y ı ld ı r ı m and Ş im ş ek [ 40 ] were followed . These were , after the selection of the sample ( all of six science textbooks from 3rd to 8th grade ) , coding categories were developed for determina - tion of analogies ( to discriminate them from examples , models etc . ) , their characteristics , and qualities due to TWA . Then the unit of analysis was determined and the analogies were identified . Finally , the analysis results were quantified . During this analogy identification process in content analysis , the words gibi ( as ) and benzer ( like ) were scanned in the textbooks . Explanations indicating relationships between a known and an unknown were considered to be an analogy . Each meaningful unit indicating a relation - ship was considered the analysis unit in the coding of analogies in the textbooks . The analogies ’ explanation of an unscientific concept ( e . g . , roads are similar to networks ) , explanation of a real situation ( the heart is a pump ) , examples , models , analogy - based scientific terminology ( cancellous bone ) , and analogy - based widespread explan - ation ( a meteor shower as a shooting star ) were not considered analogies . Then , the way in which analogies were used in textbooks was identified and their character - istics were determined in light of the literature ( i . e . , content , location , analogical relationship , presentation format , level of abstraction , position , level of enrichment , pretopic orientation , limitation , source domain , presentation medium , and aim of use [ 5 , 25 ] ) . Three of these widely examined characteristics of the analogies were fundamental steps for TWA . Then , each identified analogy was then reexamined in terms of three elements also pointed out in Glynn ’ s TWA [ 22 ] : pretopic orientation , level of enrich - ment , and explanation of limitation of the analogy . If none of these three elements existed , that analogy was termed “ poor ” ; if one or two elements existed , that analogy was called “ moderate ” ; if all of three elements existed , the analogy was referred to as “ good . ” For each of the three elements , one point was assigned : good analogies were coded with three points because they state dissimilar characteristics of the analogies as well as shared attributes ( explanation of limitations ) , presenting enriched or extended mapping by explaining which attrib - utes were shared and how they were related ( level of enrichment ) , and explaining the analog and analogical strategy ( pretopic orientation ) . If the analogy comprised one or two of them ( i . e . , moderate analogy ) one or two points were assigned . If the analogy stated neither shared attributes enriched or extended manner ( level of enrich - ment ) nor dissimilar characteristics ( limitations ) and did not explain the analog , no points were assigned . This analogy is simply stated and poor because the analog and mapping is limited for the explanation of the target and provides limited information to students . After qualification of each analogy by considering Glynn ’ s approach , examples were presented regarding how they could be developed in science teaching . During the research , reliability and validity precautions were taken . While expert opinions were obtained for the appropriateness , description , and mutual exclusiveness of the codes ( discrimination of the codes each other ) for the validity of coding , reliability coefficients were calculated . The interrater reliability coefficient for the data analysis was 0 . 88 for ten analogies among 141 at first , then full agreement of the authors was obtained after discussing the discrepancies . The intracoder reliability coefficient was 0 . 97 between two successive coding sessions of the second author by waiting four weeks . III . ANALOGIES IN SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS In this research , 141 analogies were identified in science textbooks from 3rd to 8th grades in Turkish elementary schools . Distribution of the qualifications of analogies from 3rd to 8th grade science textbooks is presented in Table I . As shown in Table I , most analogies were moderate ( 86 of 141 , 61 . 0 % ) . Such analogies comprise a minimum of one and a maximum of two elements of three fundamental elements . By considering the existence of three elements , only one analogy exists in the 6th grade ( 0 . 7 % ) in the good category . The other analogies ( 54 of 141 , 38 . 3 % ) were in the poor category because they had none of the three TABLE I . Qualifications of the analogies used in science textbooks ( from 3rd to 8th grades ) due to the elements in Glynn ’ s TWA approach .

When the qualifications of analogies for different grade level science textbooks were examined , the 7th grade textbook used analogies better than the others ( 24 of 25 were moderate ) . Figure 2 presents the distribution of the analogies among the disciplines . Figure 2 shows most of the analogies were used in the teaching of physics concepts ( 61 of 141 , 43 % ) comparing with biology , chemistry , and engineering concepts . Among 61 physics analogies , 33 of them are poor ( 54 . 1 % ) , 27 of them are moderate ( 44 . 3 % ) , and one of them is good ( 1 . 6 % ) . The analysis of the qualifications of the analogies by discipline indicated that most analogies in chemistry ( 24 of 141 , 75 . 0 % ) , biology ( 34 of 141 , 72 . 3 % ) , and engineering ( 1 of 141 , 100 % ) were in the moderate category ; however , in physics , most of the analogies ( 33 of 141 , 54 . 1 % ) were poor . In addition , most poor analogies were used in teaching physics topics , with only one good analogy being used in this field . These findings indicate that the analogies used in elementary science textbooks do not contain the important elements in analogy use , and so they are rather limited . When students read such analogies in the textbooks , they may help their understanding ; however , science teachers should consider important elements in the literature and improve analogies for effective teaching . IV . IMPROVEMENT OF TEXTBOOK ANALOGIES FOR TEACHING PHYSICS CONCEPTS This section presents some examples for the improve - ment of poor and moderate analogies for physics topics . The first analogy was for the teaching of gravitational force , and the other one was about electrical conductivity . The first analogy is used in the 7th grade science textbook : “ This force is similar to the force applied by the different poles of two magnets to each other ” [ 41 ] ( p . 70 ) . This analogy has the following characteristics : It provides a comparison of an abstract target with an abstract analog ; the mapping was rich with the statement of similarity and it was functional ; it was used in the middle of the teaching of the topic as an embedded activator , without any pretopic orientation , in plain text with a verbal - pictorial format . The textbook used this analogy to clarify the taught concept , with an environmental characteristic , and without stating the limitation of the analogy . By considering Glynn ’ s elements regarding analogy use , this analogy is moderate with enriched mapping ( it had a lack of pretopic orientation and statement of limitations ) . This analogy is critical for students ’ learning of gravity and can be used as follows with improvement for teaching . With this aim , Fig . 3 presents the use of analogy in the textbook with directly translated and revised versions together by indicating the TWA steps . As seen in the textbook use , the analogy does not contain information about the analog ( magnetism ) . Because mag - nets are well known by 7th grade students , the textbook author may not describe the magnet when constructing the analogy . However , it would be helpful to state that it was just a strategy to show the similarity of attractiveness and that they ( magnetic and gravitational forces ) are not related to each other . Although this analogy was used to clarify the gravitational force concept , students may sometimes relate magnetic forces to gravitational ones , having a miscon - ception because “ Magnetic field lines keep the human body on the surface of the earth ” [ 42 ] . They may even consider that one causes the other by saying that gravitational force is caused by a magnet at the center of Earth . Therefore , although the “ field ” concept is common for them , it should be stated they do not create each other in addition to the explanation of different features of the analog ( i . e . , repulsive force ) . Twenty - four ( 17 % ) of the 141 analogies identified in the science textbooks ( one analogy in the 4th grade , four analogies in the 5th grade , five analogies in the 6th grade , 11 analogies in the 7th grade , and three analogies in the 8th grade ) were analogical models ( i . e . , analogy – based activities [ 23 ] ) that can be used in the class during science teaching . For such activities , the target is related to the relevant feature of the model ( analog ) . Hence , it is important for students to have experience of the analogical models in the classes . There are also some examples for the improvement of analogical models used in the science textbooks which have potential to be used in science classes . An analogical model used in the 6th grade science textbook is a famous analogy : “ In an electric circuit , transfer of the energy can be considered as the flow of water in the pipes ” [ 43 ] ( p . 211 ) . This analogical model has the following characteristics : It is the extended explanation of an abstract target with a concrete analog that is both structural and functional . The analogy was used in plain FIG . 2 . Distribution of the analogies used in science textbooks among the disciplines . D İ D İŞ KÖRHASAN and HIDIR PHYS . REV . PHYS . EDUC .

It had an environmental characteristic without explaining the analogy ’ s limitation . This analogy was in the moderate category , with one point assigned for pretopic orientation and another for extended mapping . This analogy can be improved for science classes with stating the parts that the analogy breaks . Figure 4 presents how this analogy was used in the textbook and how it could be revised by TWA steps . As given in Fig . 4 , this moderate analogy had explan - ations about the analog and extended mapping . However , improvement of the statement of limitations of the analogy to students is required . This analogy is also critical for students ’ understanding of current and electrical energy transfer because sometimes students may have misconcep - tions such as “ Electrons move with the speed of light ” [ 42 ] to explain the question “ How does the bulb lighten immediately when it is turned on ? ” Hence , they consider that electric charges , together with the energy , flow in the material at the speed of light . For this reason , dissimilarity between the transfer of electrical energy and the flow of water in a pipe should be discussed with students . It should be made clear to students that , while the speed of electrical energy transfer is about that of light , the speed of electrons is quite small [ 44 ] . One physics analogy among 141 in elementary science textbooks was categorized as good . It was used in the 6th grade as follows : “ If you throw your ball , like the child in picture , towards the wall , it bounces and comes back to you … ( text ) … Reflection of sound can be considered as the bounce of a ball hitting on the wall . ” [ 43 ] ( p . 138 ) . This analogy relates an abstract target with a concrete analog with enriched mapping explaining the structural similarity . It explains the analog in plain text in a verbal - pictorial format at the beginning of the topic as an advanced organizer . It was used to clarify sound propagation with an environmental characteristic . Different from the analogies previously discussed , this analogy states the limitation of the bouncing ball analogy for the explanation of sound propagation as follows : “ However , while some of the sound waves transferred through the wall , some parts of them reflect back ” [ 43 ] ( p . 139 ) . As a result , with consideration of the three elements of Glynn , this analogy was the only good one among others in the science textbooks . V . CONCLUSION , DISCUSSION , AND SUGGESTIONS As the literature indicates , analogies are similar to double - edged swords and they should be used carefully to prevent students developing misconceptions [ 6 , 8 – 11 ] . Thus , as well as which analogies are used in science teaching , how such analogies are used should be identified [ 11 , 21 ] . In this way , missing parts of the analogies or the situations that have potential to cause misconceptions may be prevented by improvement of them by teachers and their effectiveness may be increased . This study indicated that some of the analogies used in science textbooks in the elementary level were not good , but mostly moderate due to not considering some important points discussed in Glynn ’ s TWA [ 4 , 22 , 23 ] . Some of the analogies were poor because they did not consider any of the important elements that should be taken into consid - eration in the use of analogies . This study presented some examples about how the analogies could be improved by science teachers . Regarding the qualifications of analogies used in differ - ent grade level science textbooks , the 7th grade textbook used analogies better than the others ( 24 of 25 were moderate ) . In addition , most of the analogical models used in the 7th grade had better use of analogies than the others , which may be explained by the use of analogical models focusing on pretopic orientation and extended mapping . Almost all analogies were rated moderate except one in the 7th grade textbook . This result may also be the preference of authors , in other words , different publishers [ 18 ] . In this study , 17 % of textbook analogies were found to be analogical models that can be used in science classes [ 23 ] . Because the comparison for a target is made with the model element ( as an analog ) , use of these activities in science classes is important . Otherwise , students may not understand models unfamiliar to them , so they may not understand the analogy . Hence , they should be used by science teachers with improvements to the missing parts in classes by making students active both mentally and physically . In this manner , its effectiveness may be increased , which could help students make sense of abstract concepts . Although most science textbook analogies were used in the explanations of physics topics , most of the poor analogies were used in physics ; thus , most physics anal - ogies were poor . The analysis indicated that while poor analogies lack pretopic orientations , sufficient mapping between analog and target , and did not provide a statement of limitation of analogies , moderate analogies mainly lacked the last part ( i . e . , an explanation of limitations that the analogy breaks ) . This common feature of poor and moderate analogies suggests the improvement of analogies by stating dissimilar characteristics as well as similar features that are mapped in the construction of analogies [ 4 , 5 , 11 , 22 , 23 , 25 ] . Textbook authors should also consider the other two elements to present good analogies : ( i ) enrich - ment of mapping shared features of the analog and target , and ( ii ) explanation of the analog or strategy for pretopic orientation . Because they provide more informa - tion to students about the analogy , they improve students ’ understanding of the target concept and prevent miscon - ceptions [ 6 , 11 , 12 ] . Further , science teachers should also consider these issues and use analogies with the improvement of missing parts in the textbook analogies in their science classes , D İ D İŞ KÖRHASAN and HIDIR PHYS . REV . PHYS . EDUC . RES . 15 , 010109 ( 2019 ) 010109 - 6 rather than using them directly in the textbook . Hence , it is suggested that they should revise or reorganize textbook information when teaching . As a final statement based on findings concerning the characteristics of the textbook analogies and literature , teachers should ( i ) select an appropriate analog for students and provide relevant explanations about the analogs , ( ii ) map the shared features between the analog and target clearly and avoid stating “ it is something like ” and ( iii ) state that an analog is not the reality of the target but it is a kind of explanation sharing similarities with the target . Therefore , the limitation of the analogies and unshared features of the analog and target should be noted by the teachers while teaching with analogies . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We appreciate Professor Dr .
