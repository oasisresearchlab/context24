Walters 2 * & Simona Polo 1 , 5 * Clathrin light chains ( CLCa and CLCb ) are major constituents of clathrin - coated vesicles . Unique functions for these evolutionary conserved paralogs remain elusive , and their role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells is debated . Here , we ﬁ nd and structurally characterize a direct and selective interaction between CLCa and the long isoform of the actin motor protein myosin VI , which is expressed exclusively in highly polarized tissues . Using genetically - reconstituted Caco - 2 cysts as proxy for polarized epithelia , we provide evidence for coordinated action of myosin VI and CLCa at the apical surface where these proteins are essential for ﬁ ssion of clathrin - coated pits . We further ﬁ nd that myosin VI and Huntingtin - interacting protein 1 - related protein ( Hip1R ) are mutually exclusive interactors with CLCa , and suggest a model for the sequential function of myosin VI and Hip1R in actin - mediated clathrin - coated vesicle budding . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12855 - 6 OPEN 1 IFOM , Fondazione Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare , 20139 Milan , Italy . 2 Structural Biophysics Laboratory , Center for Cancer Research , National Cancer Institute , Frederick , MD 21702 , USA . 3 Experimental Imaging Center , San Raffaele Scienti ﬁ c Institute , Milan , Italy . 4 Division of Biosciences , University College London , London WC1E 6BT , UK . 5 Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Emato - oncologia , Universita ’ degli Studi di Milano , 20122 Milan , Italy . 6 These authors contributed equally : Matteo Biancospino , Gwen R .

Clathrin is a three - legged molecule ( triskelion ) , composed of three clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) and three clathrin light chain ( CLC ) subunits . The clathrin triskelia assemble around a budding vesicle , creating a characteristic polyhedral coat , forming a clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) that captures protein cargo and further matures into a CCV . While CHCs are essential components of the cages , CLCs are apparently more regulatory . Functional roles for CLCs have been linked to regulation of cage rigidity , assembly and disassembly by extrapolation from in vitro studies 1 , and to clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) of model cargos , including G - protein - coupled receptors 3 – 5 . Importantly , CLCs appear essential at the apical surface of highly polarized tissues , where membrane tension is higher than normal and actin dynamics is critical for membrane invagination and ﬁ ssion 6 . This process involves the conserved interaction between CLCs and the actin - remodeling huntingtin - interacting proteins ( Hip1 and Hip1R ) 7 , 8 , an interaction that also contributes to clathrin – actin interactions during endosomal recy - cling and is needed for cell migration 9 . CLCs are also required for uptake of large particles , including viruses and pathogenic bacteria , such as Listeria , Yersinia , and Salmonella 10 – 12 . In these cases , the direct association of CLC with actin remodelers distinguishes these clathrin - dependent processes from canonical CME . Finally , CLCs , together with Hip1R and the actin motor protein myosin VI 13 , participate in cell – cell junction formation and remodeling through molecular mechanisms that have not been de ﬁ ned 14 . In vertebrates , two genes encode the CLCa and CLCb variants , which are 40 % divergent in sequence . High conservation of each protein variant in all vertebrate species suggests that they have distinct functions beyond their shared interaction with the Hip proteins . However , evidence for CLCa - and CLCb - speci ﬁ c roles is limited . CLCa was shown to be preferentially involved in cell spreading and migration 15 , whereas maturation of CCPs from ﬂ at lattices to invaginated buds requires phosphorylation of CLCb 16 . CLCb was also found to be overexpressed in non - small - cell lung cancer , causing altered CCP dynamics and consequently aberrant growth factor signaling 17 . In a previous study , we identi ﬁ ed clathrin as a major and speci ﬁ c binding partner of myosin VI isoforms that contain the α 2 - linker ( named myosin VI long ) and we found that myosin VI long localizes to CCPs independently of the presence of the endocytic adaptor Dab - 2 18 . These ﬁ ndings suggested a molecular link between clathrin and myosin VI long . In this manuscript , we now demonstrate that this interaction is due to a direct and selective interaction of myosin VI long with CLCa and not CLCb . We use nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy to solve the structure of the myosin VI long : CLCa complex and characterize the mechanism of interaction . The CLCa - binding region in myosin VI partially overlaps with the ubiquitin - binding domain MyUb 19 while CLCa binds myosin VI with a surface that is in close proximity to the Hip1R - binding site 7 . Guided by the structure , we identify a CLCa point mutant that loses myosin VI - binding ability , while leaving unaltered its capacity to interact with CHC or Hip1R . We further investigate the biological implications of these molecular interactions , taking advantage of genetically reconstituted Caco - 2 cells growing in three dimension ( 3D ) as cysts . Altogether , our results indicate that the interaction between myosin VI long and CLCa is needed to generate the force that leads to invagination and ﬁ ssion of CCPs at the apical surface of highly polarized cells and suggests a model for the sequential function of myosin VI and Hip1R in actin - mediated coated vesicle budding . Results CLCa is a direct and speci ﬁ c interactor of myosin VI long . In myosin VI , the presence of helix α 2 structurally de ﬁ nes a clathrin - binding domain that is unique to myosin VI long 18 , 19 ( Fig . 1a ) . To identify the corresponding myosin VI long interacting region within clathrin , we performed experiments with green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) - and glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged CHC truncations . The results revealed that the C - terminal part of the CHC is required for myosin VI interaction but failed to demonstrate direct binding between the two proteins ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1a ) . Given that CLCs are reported to interact with the C - terminus of CHC , we hypothesized their involvement in recruiting myosin VI to CCPs . Corroborating our hypothesis , confocal microscopic analysis of HeLa cells revealed reduced co - localization of myosin VI long and CHC upon CLCa transient knockdown ( KD ) as measured by Mander ’ s coef ﬁ cient ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1b , c ) . Unexpectedly , CLCb KD had the opposite effect , increasing the co - localization levels of CHC and myosin VI long , thus suggesting different roles for the two CLCs . We next examined direct binding in a pull - down assay by using bacterially puri ﬁ ed GST - CLCa and GST - CLCb full - length proteins and puri ﬁ ed fragments of long and short myosin VI isoforms spanning amino acids 998 – 1131 ( Fig . 1a ) . The results demonstrated direct and selective binding of CLCa to myosin VI long while both CLCs showed minimal binding to myosin VI short ( Fig . 1b ) . To formally test whether CLCa acts as a bridge between myosin VI long and CHC , we exploited CLCa knockout ( KO ) mice that were recently generated 5 and newly produced CLCb KO mice . Whole - brain lysates obtained from CLCa and CLCb KO mice and wild - type ( WT ) littermates were used in a pull - down assay with GST - myosin VI 998 – 1131 from long and short myosin VI isoforms . Using WT littermates , GST - myosin VI long ef ﬁ ciently pulled down CHC ( Fig . 1c ) . This interaction was dependent on CLCa since clathrin was not detected using brain lysate from CLCa KO animals ( Fig . 1c ) . Of note , brain lysate from CLCb KO mice behaved as WT littermates , similarly showing interaction between clathrin and myosin VI long ( Fig . 1c ) , despite lacking CLCb ( Fig . 1d ) . The lysis conditions used in these experiments and in our previous study 18 favor free triskelia in solution as opposed to assembled clathrin . During clathrin cage assembly , CLCs undergo conformational changes 8 , and to investigate whether the interac - tion of the coat protein with myosin VI can occur in the context of a formed CCV , we exploited the ability of clathrin to self - assemble in a pH - dependent manner 20 , 21 . We puri ﬁ ed clathrin from pig brain CCVs and induced the formation of assembled cages from native clathrin containing an endogenous mixture of CLCa and CLCb , CHC with no CLCs , or CHC reconstituted with either CLCa or CLCb only ( see Methods and Supplementary Fig . 2a – c for details ) . Puri ﬁ ed myosin VI 998 – 1131 protein co - sedimented with native clathrin cages and cages formed from clathrin with only CLCa , whereas only weak sedimentation was observed with CLCb - only cages that was similar to CHC - only cages ( Fig . 1e ) . In summary , these results demonstrate that CLCa is the subunit of clathrin responsible for binding to myosin VI long , both in the context of free triskelia and in CCVs . CLCa and myosin VI long interact with sub - micromolar af ﬁ nity . To obtain biochemical and structural insights into the myosin VI long : CLCa complex , we systematically designed CLCa deletions taking into consideration the known interaction domains of the protein 22 ( Fig . 2a ) . Incubation of these constructs with bacterially puri ﬁ ed myosin VI 998 – 1131 identi ﬁ ed a region of interaction in CLCa that spans amino acids 47 – 97 ( Fig . 2b ) . This fragment of clathrin falls in a region of limited conservation between the two ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12855 - 6 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4974 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12855 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications paralogs ( Fig . 2a ) , thus explaining the binding selectivity of CLCa to myosin VI long . By analytical size - exclusion chromatography , the CLCa : 47 – 97myosin VI 998 – 1131 sample co - eluted at the expected molecular weight for a 1 : 1 complex , indicating a stable and strong interaction in solution ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Further truncation analyses narrowed down the minimal inter - action surface to a short peptide , with no secondary structure predicted , extending from amino acids . 51 to 61 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . To evaluate the biochemical properties of the interacting CLCa peptide , we measured binding af ﬁ nity of the myosin VI – CLCa interaction by ﬂ uorescent polarization ( FP ) analysis . We designed three different ﬂ uorescein - labeled CLCa peptides ( Fig . 2a ) that span the minimal binding surface ( amino acids 51 – 61 ) exclusively or with ﬁ ve amino acids added at the N ( amino acids 46 – 61 ) or C ( amino acids 51 – 66 ) terminal end . FP measurements revealed a tenfold increase in af ﬁ nity for the peptide 46 – 61 compared to the other two peptides ( Fig . 2c ) , resulting in a dissociation constant ( K d ) of 0 . 93 μ M . Thus , in addition to the minimal binding region , amino acids spanning 46 – 51 conserved between CLCa and CLCb contribute to binding , which may explain the residual interaction observed by both CLCs to myosin VI short ( Fig . 1b ) . We further tested the 46 – 61 peptide for binding to various myosin VI constructs to better de ﬁ ne the interaction boundaries on myosin VI . Con ﬁ rming our previous results 18 , the long and the short isoforms of myosin VI showed 2 log - fold difference in af ﬁ nity for CLCa ( 0 . 93 μ M versus 96 μ M , respectively , Fig . 2c , d ) . As expected , the myosin VI 1069 – 1131 construct that lacks the α 2 - linker displayed a remarkably reduced K d . Finally , the region encompassing amino acids 1050 – 1131 of myosin VI long showed the highest af ﬁ nity ( 0 . 4 μ M , Fig . 2d ) and was therefore chosen for the subsequent structural experiments . CLCa 46 – 61 forms a helix in a complex with myosin VI 1050 – 1131 . To further characterize the myosin VI : CLCa binding interface , we ﬁ rst compared two - dimensional ( 2D ) 1 H , 15 N - HSQC spectra of myosin VI 1050 – 1131 before and after addition of the unlabeled CLCa peptide spanning 46 – 61 ( Fig . 3a ) . Large effects were observed for many amino acids , which were quanti ﬁ ed by che - mical shift perturbation ( CSP ) analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Residues with CSP values of one standard deviation ( SD ) above average cluster to three regions in the myosin VI sequence ( Sup - plementary Fig . 3 ) located at the N - terminal end of α 2 , N - terminal to α 3 , and toward the C - terminal end of α 4 . The CSPs above the mean were mapped onto the previously solved structure of free myosin VI ( Fig . 3b ) , which revealed a localized region focused at the C - terminal half of α 4 and the N - terminal region of α 2 . b Long S ho r t Long S ho r t Long S ho r t GST GST - CLCa Input Long S ho r t 152025 37 50 GST - CLCb 10 Myosin VI short Myosin VI long c CHC I npu t 5 % G S T Long S ho r t I npu t 5 % G S T Long S ho r t I npu t 5 % G S T Long S ho r t I npu t 5 % G S T Long S ho r t IB : CLCb KO WT CLCa KO WT 25 37 150 Ponceau ( GST - myosin VI ) d I npu t 10 % CHC + C L C ab CHC _ CHC CHC + C L C a CHC + C L C b I npu t 10 % CHC + C L C ab CHC _ CHC + C L C a CHC + C L C b CLCs * 150 100 50 37 25 15 10 Myosin VI short Myosin VI long Myosin VI short Myosin VI long a CHC IB : Myosin VI CLCa CLCb Vinculin W T C L C a K O W T C L C b K O 150150 37 37 100 e 1132 1 1294 835 998 1267 Myosin VI short Myosin VI long 770 Motor domain Helical domain Globular domain 3HB SAH 3HB SAH MOTOR MOTOR MIU AS MyUb MIU MyUb IQ motif IQ motif Fig . 1 CLCa is a direct and speci ﬁ c interactor of myosin VI long in triskelia and clathrin cages . a Scheme of the myosin VI highlighting the region involved in clathrin binding ( amino acids 998 – 1131 of the long isoform ) .

As part of an effort to solve the structure of this CLCa region complexed with myosin VI 1050 – 1131 by NMR , we assigned chemical shift values to the myosin VI - bound CLCa fragment by 3D HNCACB ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy ( NOESY ; examples provided in Supplementary Fig . 5 ) experiments recorded on equimolar 15 N , 13 C - labeled CLCa and unlabeled myosin VI 1050 – 1131 ; we also assigned chemical shift values to CLCa - bound myosin VI , as described in Methods . The C α and C ’ chemical shift assignments of CLCa were compared to those of randomly coiled values to generate a chemical shift index plot ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . This information was combined with NOE analyses obtained by NOESY experiments to de ﬁ ne the secondary structure of CLCa ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) as being α - helical from residues I46 – I54 . We next measured intermolecular interactions between myosin VI and CLCa directly by performing 3D 1 H , 13 C half - ﬁ ltered NOESY experiments ; resulting spectra show NMR signals between intermolecular atoms that are within 5 Å of each other 24 . In agreement with the CSP analysis , we identi ﬁ ed large numbers of intermolecular NOEs between CLCa and helices α 2 and α 4 of myosin VI ( Supplementary Figs . 7 and 8 ) . In particular , residues P1055 , M1058 , and M1062 from helix α 2 ( Supplemen - tary Figs . 7a , b and 8 ) and V1120 , Y1121 , and W1124 from helix α 4 ( Supplementary Figs . 7c – f and 8 ) displayed numerous intermolecular NOEs to CLCa . CLCa binds to isoform - speci ﬁ c α 2 and α 4 of MyUb .

In agreement with our chemical shift index data ( in Supplementary Fig . 6 ) , CLCa 46 – 61 forms a short α - helix ( yellow , Fig . 3c – e ) that appears to complete the myosin VI structural domain by abutting the N - terminal end of α 3 and packing against α 2 and α 4 ( Fig . 3d ) .

Myosin VI P1055 extends this CLCa - binding surface through its interaction with F52 ( Fig . 4b , NOEs shown in Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . At an adjacent side of the CLCa helix , myosin VI R1117 , V1120 , Y1121 , and W1124 surround CLCa A51 and I54 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . In addition , the W1124 indole group forms a hydrogen bond to the sidechain carboxyl group of E50 ( Fig . 4a ) . The RRL motif required for binding to multiple adaptor proteins including optineurin and GIPC 18 , 25 , 26 is embedded in α 4 ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . R1116 does not participate in the interaction and remains surface exposed , whereas both R1117 and L1118 contribute to CLCa binding . R1117 , required for myosin VI structural integrity 18 , 27 , maintains its hydrogen bonds to S1087 and E1113 as in free myosin VI and forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of CLCa D56 , the sidechain of which also forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of myosin VI Y1091 ( Fig . 4c ) . Lastly , L1118 of the RRL motif contributes to binding though interactions with CLCa L55 ( Fig . 4b ) . Notably , the CLCa amino acids critical for binding to myosin VI , including A51 , I54 , L55 , and D56 , are not conserved in CLCb ( Fig . 4d ) , thus providing an explanation for paralog speci ﬁ city . The importance of the identi ﬁ ed interactions is supported by GST pull - down experiments .

There , myosin VI localizes to the apical surface facing the lumen of the organs at the base of microvilli 29 , 30 ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) . To analyze the physio - logical role of the CLCa : myosin VI complex in a cellular model of polarized epithelial tissue , we took advantage of the intestine - derived epithelial Caco - 2 cells that form polarized cysts when plated as a single - cell suspension embedded in 3D EHS - derived matrix 31 . Notably , in this Caco - 2 cellular model system , a clear switch toward the myosin VI long isoform occurs during the acquisition of full polarity both in 2D and 3D systems , as mea - sured by reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( Supplementary Fig . 10c ) . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and confocal microscopy analysis showed that the cysts are fully formed and polarized ( Supplementary Fig . 10d – f ) and myosin VI long is enriched in the apical terminal web region together with occludin ( Supplementary Fig . 10d ) . We then gen - erated Caco - 2 cells stably expressing red ﬂ uorescent protein ( RFP ) - WT or an RFP - I54D mutant rat CLCa as these constructs are resistant to the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) oligos designed on the human sequence . Upon ef ﬁ cient depletion of the endogenous CLCa and CLCb by siRNA oligos ( Supplementary Fig . 11a – c and Fig . 5a ) , co - immunoprecipitation analysis per - formed with lysates from 2D fully polarized Caco - 2 cells demonstrated that the I54D mutant was largely unable to interact with myosin VI ( Fig . 5a ) , validating our previous in vitro results . Next , single Caco - 2 reconstituted cells depleted of endogenous CLCs were cultured in matrigel and 7 days after cysts were counted and stained to evaluate adherens and tight junctions and the localization of RFP - CLCa WT or I54D mutant ( Fig . 5b ) . Exogenous RFP - CLCa I54D mutant , similarly to the WT protein , was enriched in the apical region toward the lumen and did not appear to affect the ability of the cells to form cysts ( Fig . 5c ) or prevent the establishment of apical basal polarity ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 10e , f ) . Clues as to the molecular requirement for CLCa – myosin VI interaction were derived from EM analysis of the cysts . As CLCs are implicated in CME , we investigated the CCPs that formed at the apical surface facing the lumen in control , CLC - depleted , and reconstituted RFP - CLCa variants . CCPs stemming from the PM were classi ﬁ ed as shallow , omega / constricted , or elongated according to their morphology ( Fig . 5c , left panel ) . Compared to mock - treated Caco - 2 cysts , cysts depleted of CLCs displayed a signi ﬁ cantly greater proportion of CCPs with an aberrant morphology , consisting of elongated pits joined to the PM by “ long necks ” ( Fig . 5c ) . These structures closely resembled those induced by the dominant - negative mutant of dynamin , DynK44A 32 . Strikingly , while WT RFP - CLCa fully rescued this phenotype , the I54D mutant was unable to do the same , indicating that the morphological defect scored in the absence of CLCs can be ascribed to the lack of myosin VI interaction with CLCa ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . 11d ) . These results are compatible with the possibility that the interaction of CLCa with myosin VI is part of the machinery that controls CCP ﬁ ssion . Previously , CLCs and their binding partner Hip1R were implicated in this process at the apical membrane of polarized cells 6 . Intriguingly , the myosin VI - binding region we identi ﬁ ed here on CLCa partially overlaps with the Hip1R - binding region 7 ( Fig . 6a ) . Thus we evaluated the ability of myosin VI and Hip1R to bind simultaneously to CLCa , using an in vitro a siRNA CLCa / b + – + + – + 75 - RFP - CLCa Input 40 μ g IP anti RFP CHC 150 - CLCb Tubulin 150 - MyoVI 50 - 25 - CTRL WT I54D CTRL WT I54D 37 - CLCa CTRL KD WT I54D Shallow Omega / constricted Elongated % o f c l a t h r i n c oa t ed s t r u c t u r e s S ha ll o w O m ega E l onga t e d b c C T R L K D W T I 54 D 0 20 40 60 80 100 n45 n32 n55 n50 CTRL WT I54D E - cadh Zo - 1 RFP DAPI Fig . 5 CLCa I54D is a selective myosin VI - impaired mutant . a Co - immunoprecipitation experiment using lysates from Caco - 2 reconstituted cell lines .

We incubated GST - tagged CLCa full - length protein with the coiled - coil region of Hip1R spanning amino acids 346 – 655 and added increasing amounts of myosin VI 1050 – 1131 protein fragment . Analysis by Coomassie staining and immunoblotting showed that myosin VI addition caused progressive displacement of Hip1R from CLCa ( Fig . 6b ) , indicating a direct competition between the two CLCa interactors possibly due to steric hindrance . Consistent with separate but proximal binding sites for these two CLCa - binding proteins , Hip1R bound both the CLCa I54D mutant and WT CLCa , but its binding to the mutant was not affected by myosin VI ( Fig . 6c ) . Notably , CLCb interaction with Hip1R was insensitive to the addition of myosin VI in the same competition assay ( Supplementary Fig . 11e ) , con ﬁ rming once again the selectivity of myosin VI for CLCa .

Once CCP passes the endocytic checkpoint , it undergoes a maturation process mediated by PIP2 turnover and the activity of several endocytic accessory factors ( e . g . , Hip1R ) . ( 1 ) As the bud expands , myosin VI is recruited to CCPs by CLCa and disengages Hip1R , which preferentially associates with epsin at the CCP edge . Actin anchoring and polymerization is thereby restricted to the neck of the invaginating pit where Hip1R along with epsin provide a link between actin nucleation and the CCP . Alternatively , formation of a complex between epsins and Hip1R at the neck would recruit Hip1R from the coat , exposing the myosin VI - binding site on CLCa and causing recruitment of myosin VI to the CCP . ( 2 ) Myosin monomer bound to CLCa anchors the CCP to the actin meshwork engaged in retrograde ﬂ ow and facilitates movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm . After dimerization induced by Dab2 or oligomerization , myosin VI becomes a processive motor that walk toward the minus end of actin ﬁ laments providing mechanical force to oppose membrane tension in polarized tissues and promoting the ﬁ nal dynamin - mediated ﬁ ssion step ( not depicted ) . Future experiments are needed to test this model .

In agreement with the competition assay , Hip1R binds WT and mutant CLCa equally well but with a K d a log higher with respect to myosin VI ( Fig . 6d ) . Altogether , these data provide evidence for coordinated action of myosin VI and CLCa in the ﬁ ssion of CCPs at the apical surface of polarized cells and identify a direct competition between Hip1R and myosin VI . Discussion It is well established that actin remodeling during CME is required when the PM tension is high 6 or when there is a need to change the mechanical properties of the clathrin lattice to engulf non - canonical bulky cargo , such as viral or bacterial pathogens 10 , 12 . The functional link between CCPs and actin is represented by the CLC – Hip1R interaction in both yeast and mammals 33 – 35 . Here we identi ﬁ ed the role of a third player in this process , myosin VI , which selectively binds to CLCa and directly competes with Hip1R . While myosin VI has been previously implicated in CME 26 , 36 , 37 , our structural de ﬁ nition of the CLCa – myosin VI interaction provides the molecular details of such involvement . Myosin VI is unique among mammalian myosins in that it moves toward the minus end of F - actin 38 . This unique motor protein supports critical functions at multiple cellular sites via interaction with different adaptors that target it to speci ﬁ c organelles . We recently showed that an alternatively spliced α 2 - linker modulates the myosin VI interactome and is the causative link to its diverse functions 18 . In particular , the myosin VI long isoform includes the exon cassette that codes for the α 2 - linker and is endowed with clathrin - binding capacities and endocytic functions 18 . Here we reveal that myosin VI is recruited to CCPs via a selective interaction with CLCa . Our biochemical and structural characterization of the myosin VI – CLCa interaction identi ﬁ ed contacts unique to CLCa that are contributed largely from a helical structure . Key differences in the amino acid sequence of the CLCa and CLCb paralogs are likely responsible for the lack of binding between myosin VI and CLCb ( Fig . 4d ) . Speci ﬁ cally , A51 and I54 in CLCa are both replaced with smaller residues ( Gly and Ala , respectively , in CLCb ) , which likely diminishes the hydro - phobic contacts with myosin VI ( Fig . 4a , b ) . In CLCb , D56 is replaced with an alanine , which cannot form a hydrogen bond with Y1091 in myosin VI ( Fig . 4c ) . Finally , L55 , which embeds itself between helices α 2 and α 4 of myosin VI ( Fig . 4a , b ) , is replaced with a proline in CLCb . Owing to the structural rigidity of proline , this amino acid may disrupt the helical turn , possibly preventing CLCb from ﬁ tting into the myosin VI - binding pocket that accommodates CLCa . The CLCa peptide identi ﬁ ed here as determinant for myosin VI interaction was invisible in the previously published structures of the clathrin lattice and the central domain of the triskelion 8 , 23 and identi ﬁ ed as a conformationally labile peptide modulated by calcium ion concentration 39 , strongly suggesting that this ﬂ exible peptide is an important element of regulation for CLC . Calcium was also shown to mobilize myosin VI from a compact dormant state into a cargo - binding primed state 40 . Interestingly , the seg - ment of the myosin VI tail region mediating this regulation ( amino acids 1060 – 1125 ) matches exactly with the clathrin - binding domain . In resting conditions , myosin VI adopts a backfolded , dormant state , with the tail domain amino acids 1060 – 1125 binding to apo - calmodulin ; at high calcium levels , myosin VI unfolds and the release of the myosin VI tail mobilizes the motor , priming it to bind to cargo 40 . In this open structural conformation of myosin VI , CLCa binding should be more favorable . Consistently , addition of 2 mM Ca 2 + to the lysis buffer signi ﬁ cantly improved the co - immunoprecipitation between myosin VI and CLCa ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Thus our results , together with these previous ﬁ ndings , suggest that release of intracellular calcium could orchestrate the timing of localized myosin VI activation and of clathrin – myosin VI functional interaction . Like Hip1R 41 and CLC 42 , myosin VI is largely dispensable for CME in 2D culture in vitro . However , the speci ﬁ c expression of myosin VI long in polarized tissues ( e . g . , kidney and intestine ) , together with its features as an actin - based motor , prompted us to examine its function in Caco - 2 cysts , used as proxy of the enterocytes lining the small intestine . We show here that , in Caco - 2 grown as cysts , a clear switch toward myosin VI long occurs as cysts develop with this endo - genous isoform enriched at the apical membrane , together with clathrin - rich structures . As further discussed below , CME in epithelial polarized cells is dependent on actin polymerization , which drives membrane invagination against the membrane tension that rigidi ﬁ es the apical membrane 6 . In this process , CLCa may recruit myosin VI to CCPs to provide the force necessary to complete neck constriction , ﬁ ssion , and release . Indeed , using a genetic reconstitution approach , we were able to demonstrate a clear change in the distribution of CCP structures at the apical surface when we abrogated the CLCa – myosin VI interaction . The increased number of elongated CCPs present at the apical surface of CLC - depleted cysts or cysts reconstituted with I54D CLCa mutant , which does not bind myosin VI , sug - gests a delay in CCP progression at this surface . Our results are compatible with the idea of myosin VI acting at the neck of a mature CCP to promote ﬁ ssion . Consistent with this notion , recent evidence demonstrated that myosin VI , together with branched actin ﬁ laments , mediates severing by constricting the neck of budding tubules that are released from melanosomes 43 . The involvement of the myosin VI – CLCa interaction in the CCP ﬁ ssion step at the apical membrane of polarized cells is attractive , as this step is where actin has also been implicated in yeast 44 and observed in mammalian cells 45 . It is tempting to speculate that the lack of CLCa – myosin VI interaction and thus a defective CME is the cause of the altered level of CTFR , megalin receptor and sodium type - IIa cotransporter ( NaPi2a ) observed at the apical membrane of myosin VI - depleted enterocytes and renal proximal tubular cells 19 , 46 – 51 . Our results unveil a direct competition between myosin VI and Hip1R for CLCa ( Fig . 6a – d ) that likely establishes partitioning of actin activity during the various stages of CCP formation ( Fig . 6e ) . Current knowledge localizes Hip1R bound to CLCs throughout the CCP as well as inserted directly in the surrounding PM via its lipid - binding ANTH domain 52 , 53 . The conformational change induced by CLC binding masks the actin - binding domain of Hip proteins in the coat 8 and would exclude actin interaction at this site . At the adjacent membrane , Hip protein interaction with the epsin family proteins , both in yeast 52 and in mammals 54 , results in a multimeric heterocomplex 52 , 55 that may preferentially occur at the neck of an invaginating CCP 56 . Here Hip proteins dissociated from the clathrin coat could interact with actin , generating the active site required for the invagination of coated pits . Indeed , depletion of either Hip1R or epsins results in similar abnormal actin nucleation at endocytic sites where vesicle budding is inhibited 33 , 54 . Thus regulation of actin activity by Hip proteins seems to be restricted to the neck of an invaginating vesicle 8 where barbed ends of branched actin ﬁ laments are concentrated 45 and ﬁ ssion occurs as dynamin assembles into a helical coat 57 , 58 . How might this happen ? We propose here that myosin VI contributes to the temporal regulation of Hip1R action while producing the forces to overcome high membrane tension ( Fig . 6e ) .

At the vesicle neck , Hip1R regulates actin ﬁ lament polymerization 33 while Dab2 may tether myosin VI recruited by CLCa into a stable and active dimer 59 . Finally , acting as a processive cellular motor on branched actin ﬁ laments , myosin VI may contribute to the release of the invaginating vesicle , promoting CCP ﬁ ssion ( Fig . 6e ) . Notably , our ﬁ ndings are in line with previous studies based on total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy that revealed myosin VI to be recruited during a late stage of clathrin - mediated internalization , concomitantly with dynamin and regulators of actin polymeriza - tion , to promote the scission of the invaginated membrane 60 . Consistent with the idea of myosin VI actively participating in the latest steps of CCP maturation , in vivo analysis of renal proximal tubule cells in mice lacking myosin VI showed reduced uptake of endocytic markers and accumulation of AP2 and Dab2 at the PM 49 . Our ﬁ ndings indicate that only CLCa - containing CCPs may be subjected to the regulation exerted by myosin VI . CLCa - null mice lack the myosin VI – CLCa interaction and its unique function and this de ﬁ ciency may contribute to the 50 % postnatal mortality rate of these animals 5 . Consistent with this idea , CLCa is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all vertebrate tissues , whereas CLCb characteristically exhibits variable levels 5 , and compared to CLCb , CLCa is preferentially associated with peripheral clathrin - coated structures and proteins involved in cell spreading 15 , a process that also requires actin regulation . We are at an early stage of appreciating the extent of the selective activity of each CLC paralog , with hints of CLCa - and CLCb - associated functions emerging in recent reports 15 – 17 . The high conservation and distinction of the two CLC - encoding genes that are preserved within all vertebrates 61 strongly support the notion that CLCa and CLCb proteins have non - redundant functions . In the emerging scenario , our data indicate CLCa as a key modulator of clathrin interactions with the actin cytoskeleton . Methods Cell lines and KO mouse strains and constructs .

The NMR spectra were processed with NMRpipe 64 and analyzed with XEASY 65 . Backbone assignments of myosin VI and CLCa in complex were done manually based on chemical shifts obtained previously on free myosin VI ( BMRB 25544 ) and the HNCACB and HNCO spectra ; the HNCACB spectrum showed both the intra - residue and proceeding residue C α signals for most residues ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Residues that were ambiguous were veri ﬁ ed with HN - HN and α - HN NOEs in the 15 NOESY ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Sidechain assignments were obtained by manual analysis of HNCACB , 13 C - dispersed NOESY , and 15 N - dispersed NOESY experiments . Structure determination and re ﬁ nement . NOE assignments were done manually using 13 C - dispersed NOESY , 15 N - dispersed NOESY , and 13 C - dispersed half - ﬁ l - tered NOESY experiments . Chemical shifts for backbone carbons and amide nitrogen , amide hydrogen , H α , and C β from myosin VI and CLCa were used with TALOS 66 to obtain backbone ϕ and ψ torsion angle restraints . Structure calculations were performed with Xplor - NIH ( version 2 . 47 ) 67 by using standard scripts . Twenty linear starting structures were subjected to 35 , 000 simulated annealing steps followed by 5000 cooling steps , both of 0 . 005 ps . The lowest energy structure from this set was used as the starting structure for re ﬁ nement closely following the protocol described in ref . 68 but with a temperature step of 1K used during simulated annealing . Constraints used during the structure calculations include intramolecular and intermolecular NOE restraints , dihedral angle restraints , and backbone hydrogen bonds in helical regions . A summary of the data used for the structure calculations is provided in Table 1 . Hydrogen bond distances between the acceptor oxygen and donor hydrogen and nitrogen atoms were set to 1 . 81 – 2 . 09 and 2 . 71 - 3 . 13 Å , respectively . Structures and NOE assignments were checked manually to identify errors , corrections were made if necessary , and structures recalculated ; this process was done iteratively . Of the 300 ﬁ nal re ﬁ ned structures calculated , the 20 lowest energy structures without distance violations > 0 . 5 Å and dihedral angle violations > 5° were selected to represent the structure of myosin VI in complex with CLCa . Pymol ( Schrödinger ) was used for visualization and ﬁ gure generation ; MOLMOL 69 was used for r . m . s . d . calculation and ﬁ gure generation . Among the 20 lowest energy structures , no amino acid was disfavored by Ramachandran analyses ; 1 , 6 , and 94 % were in the generously allowed , allowed , and favored regions , respectively .
