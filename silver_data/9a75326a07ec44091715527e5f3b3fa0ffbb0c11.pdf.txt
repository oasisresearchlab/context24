ARTICLE Gender diversity of research consortia contributes to funding decisions in a multi - stage grant peer - review process Stefano Bianchini 1 ✉ , Patrick Llerena 1 , S ı la Öcalan - Özel 1 & Emre Özel 1 This study seeks to draw connections between the grant proposal peer - review and the gender representation in research consortia . We examined the implementation of a multi - disciplinary , pan - European funding scheme — EUROpean COllaborative RESearch Scheme ( 2003 – 2015 ) — and the reviewers ’ materials that this generated . EUROCORES promoted investigator - driven , multinational collaborative research in multiple scienti ﬁ c areas and brought together 9158 Principal Investigators ( PI ) who teamed up in 1347 international consortia that were sequentially evaluated by 467 expert panel members and 1862 external reviewers . We found systematically unfavourable evaluations for consortia with a higher proportion of female PIs . This gender effect was evident in the evaluation outcomes of both panel members and reviewers : applications from consortia with a higher share of female scientists were less successful in panel selection and received lower scores from external reviewers . Interestingly , we found a systematic discrepancy between the evaluative language of written review reports and the scores assigned by reviewers that works against consortia with a higher share of female participants . Reviewers did not perceive female scientists as being less competent in their comments , but they were negatively sensitive to a high female ratio within a consortium when scoring the proposed research project . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 022 - 01204 - 6 OPEN 1 BETA , CNRS , Université de Strasbourg , 67000 Strasbourg , France . ✉ email : s . bianchini @ unistra . fr HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 9 : 195 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 022 - 01204 - 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; Introduction G ender is one of the strongest social constructs employed for stereotyping others ( Wood and Eagly , 2012 ; Haines et al . , 2016 ) . When men succeed in a domain that is culturally de ﬁ ned as masculine , their success is attributed to innate ability and talent , while women ’ s success is typically attributed to external factors , including luck ( Swim and Sanna , 1996 ) . Words such as intelligent and competent are found within the cluster of positive traits of men ( Abele and Wojciszke , 2007 ) but not of women ( Eagly and Karau , 2002 ; Carli et al . , 2016 ) . As a result , women are generally accorded less status and power than men ( Harris , 1991 ; Diekman and Eagly , 2000 ; Fiske et al . , 2002 ) . Academia is no exception to this behaviour . A number of studies point out that women are more often pro ﬁ led as being less capable and skilled in the sciences ( Foschi et al . , 1994 ; Moss - Racusin et al . , 2012 ; Chubb and Derrick , 2020 ) , and are , thereby , devalued as scienti ﬁ c leaders ( Ellemers et al . , 2012 ) . This , in turn , can negatively affect peer evaluations of women ’ s scienti ﬁ c merit and success , systematically downgrading their quali ﬁ cations and amplifying disparities in access to the resources — primarily , the research funding — needed to conduct science ( Bedi et al . , 2012 ; Bornmann et al . , 2007 ; Alvarez et al . , 2019 ; Huang et al . , 2020 ) . Such obstacles to research funding can reduce the presence of women in positions of scienti ﬁ c leadership and have important secondary effects on their mobility and career advancement ( Bloch et al . , 2014 ; Geuna , 2015 ) . Scholars refer to this phenomenon as gender bias in grant allocation . The term ‘ bias ’ is generally used to describe the representations that are produced by sub - optimal decision - mak - ing based on systematic simpli ﬁ cations and deviations from the tenets of rationality ( Cosmides and Tooby , 1994 ; Haselton et al . , 2016 ; Korteling et al . , 2017 ) . As such , an individual may attribute certain attitudes and stereotypes to another person based on observable characteristics , and in this case , gender . Previous research on gender bias in the peer - review of grant applications provides mixed evidence and is somewhat inconclusive . Some studies found a gender bias ( Wenneras and Wold , 1997 ; Viner et al . , 2004 ; Husu and De Cheveigné , 2010 ) ; others did not ( Bazeley , 1998 ; Ley and Hamilton , 2008 ; Ceci and Williams , 2011 ; Lawson et al . , 2021 ) . The existing studies generally focus on a single stage in the evaluation ( often those involving panel experts or external reviewers ) ; on applications made at the individual level ; and on a single country — see Table 1 for details . Here we examined the implementation of a multi - disciplinary , pan - European funding scheme — EUROpean COllaborative RESearch ( EUROCORES ) Scheme — and the reviewers ’ materials that this generated . Our research contributes to the debate on “ gender in science ” by investigating the associations between the proportion of female PIs within a consortium and project eva - luation , through all stages of peer review , and for all scienti ﬁ c domains between 2003 and 2015 . Our study has three main objectives . First , we examined whether a potential gender bias is directed also against groups of individuals ( i . e . , research consortia ) , and not only against the individual PI , as revealed in previous studies . Second , EURO - CORES data allowed us to examine whether this gender effect is evident in the decision - making process of groups of individuals ( expert panels ) and single evaluators ( external reviewers ) , and how the effect propagates through the subsequent stages of the evaluation process . Third , we provided a lexicon - based sentiment analysis of the written reports of external reviewers to examine whether the sentiment polarity and the rate of emotion in the review texts are consistent with the review scores . Our study contributes to explain the persistent under - representation of women in top academic roles , with important implications for institutions and policy makers . Data and methods The EUROCORES scheme . The data for our analyses are drawn from the multi - stage peer - review evaluation process of the EUROCORES scheme ( 2003 – 2015 ) . The aim of this scheme was to promote cooperation between national funding agencies in Europe by providing a mechanism for the collaborative funding of research on selected priority topics in and across all scienti ﬁ c domains . EUROCORES was based on a number of Research Programmes , the topics of which were selected through an annual call for themes , and which , in turn , comprised a number of Collaborative Research Projects ( CRPs ) . Each CRP included at least three Individual Projects ( IPs ) , each led by a Principal Investigator ( PI ) af ﬁ liated with a European university . CRP consortia worked together on a common work - plan and towards the common goals set out in their Outline Proposal ( OP ) and , subsequently , in their Final Proposal ( FP ) . EUROCORES , which was terminated in 2015 , supported 47 Research Programmes in different areas of research with an overall budget of some 150M euros . The evaluation process of the EUROCORES scheme consisted of three consecutive stages ( Fig . 1 ) . At the ﬁ rst stage , the Expert Panels were responsible for evaluating Outline Proposals prior to inviting a consortium to submit a Final Proposal . Evaluations took place in separate face - to - face meetings over 1 – 2 days . Panels were made up , on average , of 12 members and each member was a spokesperson for three proposals ( i . e . , for at least nine Individual Projects ) . Panel decisions were made through consensus building , a process involving the interaction of peers within a scienti ﬁ c group . At the second stage , Final Proposals were received from selected applications and were sent for written reports to ( at least ) three anonymous referees . Reviewers were asked to complete a standardized evaluation form comprising 8 – 10 sections , each focusing on different criteria such as scienti ﬁ c quality , project feasibility , team interdisciplinarity , and others . Typically , the referee had 4 weeks to provide a written assessment of the proposal . For each section , a score was assigned on a 5 - point Likert scale and comments were made in a dedicated space ( at least 100 words for each question ) . One reviewer was responsible for evaluating just one project on each occasion . Thus , the overall evaluation was the result of an individual decision - making process with no ( particularly strong ) time constraints . At the third stage , once all the review reports had been received , expert panel members ( the same as in the ﬁ rst stage of the evaluation ) met a second time to make a decision based on the application , the referees ’ comments , the replies from applicants and open discussion . At this stage , panel members selected applications to be recommended for funding . The overall success rate for EUROCORES grant applications was ~ 13 % . In this study , we examined the effect of the gender composition of the research consortia on grant evaluation decisions at three stages of the review process : ﬁ rst expert panel evaluation ( 1st stage ) ; external reviewer evaluation ( 2nd stage ) ; and second expert panel evaluation ( 3rd stage ) . The sample . Our raw data contained information on 10 , 533 applicants , who teamed up to submit 1642 Outline Proposals [ 886 accepted and 756 rejected — success rate : 53 % ] and 886 Final Proposals [ 223 accepted and 663 rejected — success rate : 25 % ] , and on 2182 external reviewers and 491 panel members throughout the three stages of the evaluation process . For each CRP application , which is our unit of observation , the data contain information on name , year of birth , gender and institu - tional af ﬁ liation of the applicants for each PI and evaluators ( panel members and external reviewers ) , the application dates , ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 022 - 01204 - 6 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 9 : 195 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 022 - 01204 - 6 the amount of funding requested as well as the review reports and scores given by the evaluators at corresponding stages . The original data required some pre - processing . First , about 20 % of the original observations were incomplete — e . g . , they were missing the gender of the applicant , his or her age , and af ﬁ liation . Thus , where possible , we manually retrieved the missing information from each researcher ’ s personal and / or institutional web page . Second , the sample for the analysis was limited to proposals with complete information for all consecutive stages . Hence , the ﬁ nal sample consists of 1347 CRPs from 9158 unique applicants [ sampling fraction : 82 % and 87 % , respectively ] ; 467 individual panel members [ 95 % ] ; and 1862 written reports from external reviewers [ 85 % ] .

The studies mentioned in this table start from 2008 . Only a few studies examine the review materials and each step of the grant evaluation process . Fig . 1 EUROCORES multi - stage evaluation process . Submission of Outline Proposals ( OPs ) of Collaborative Research Projects ( CRPs ) corresponds to the APPLICATION phase . In the 1st STAGE of peer - review evaluation , OPs are sifted by Expert Panels and selected projects are invited to submit Final Proposals ( FPs ) . In the 2nd STAGE , FPs are sent to at least 3 different External Reviewers to get written reports and scores for each FP . In the 3rd STAGE , Expert Panels select the FPs to be recommended for funding based on the reviewers ’ reports and scienti ﬁ c merit . In the GRANT Phase , each Individual Project ( IP ) receives a funding decision from its National Funding Organization ( NFO ) . HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 022 - 01204 - 6 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 9 : 195 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 022 - 01204 - 6 3 Project selection occurred in the ﬁ rst and third phases . The success rate in the ﬁ rst phase ( OP to FP ) was 38 % ( n = 511 projects ; n = 3579 applicants ) , and in the third phase about 60 % ( n = 306 projects ; n = 2200 applicants ) . A cursory glance at gender statistics suggests that female participation declined in each consecutive stage : 19 . 8 % in the outline proposals , 17 . 5 % in the ﬁ nal proposals and 16 . 7 % after the second expert panel evaluation . The share of female evaluators is roughly 20 % ( Fig . 2 ) . Statistical analysis . We explored the association between the proportion of female PIs in EUROCORES research consortia and the decisions made by different evaluators throughout the three stages of the evaluation process . The decisions of the panel experts were binary ( i . e . , selected vs . not selected ) while the external reviewers assigned scores on a 5 - point Likert scale and justi ﬁ ed these scores in a short written submission ( reviewer ’ s report ) . Thus , we used probit ( for the ﬁ rst and third stages ) and ordinary least - squares ( for the second stage ) models with standard errors clustered at the research programme level . The dependent variable in the second stage of the peer - review process is only observable for a portion of the data — i . e . , those proposals that passed the ﬁ rst stage . The sample selection bias that might result from the sequentiality of the evaluation process was recti ﬁ ed by Heckman ’ s two - step estimation procedure ( Heckman , 1979 ; Puhani , 2000 ) . For the ﬁ rst and third stages , we are interested in the factors — in primis the gender composition of a consortium — that in ﬂ uence the likelihood of being selected by panel experts . For the second stage of selection ( external reviewers ) , we modelled both the reviewers ’ scores and the sentiments associated with their reviews , and test for inconsistencies between scores and sentiments . More speci ﬁ cally , we determined sentiment polarity in the reviewers ’ reports using the VADER — Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner — algorithm ( Hutto and Gilbert , 2014 ) and developed a list of evaluative terms for both project and applicants using the Word2vec model ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) . The general sentiment analysis tool VADER captured the emotional polarity ( positive / negative ) and intensity ( strength ) of reviews in relation to the applicants and their research proposals . Alternative algorithms were also tested ( i . e . , Syuzhet and sentimentR ) . The evaluative terms were obtained through a Word2vec Skip - Gram model ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) , trained on the corpus of reviewers ’ reports . Technically , the words of a vocabulary of size V were positioned in a D - dimensional space . Hence , each word was represented by a D - dimensional continuous vector — i . e . , the word representation . Words that tend to appear close to each other in the corpus have similar vector representations . This property allowed us to identify a list of lexical features ( bi - grams ) that co - occurred with high probability in a context window surrounding three terms : ‘ principal investigator ’ , ‘ consortium ’ and ‘ team ’ . 1 The identi ﬁ ed bi - grams refer to the adjectives and adverbs used by reviewers to judge PIs and consortia , and include evaluative terms such as ‘ internationally recognized ’ , ‘ highly quali ﬁ ed ’ , or ‘ world - renowned ’ . These terms are similar to those identi ﬁ ed in previous studies on textual analysis of reviewers ’ reports ( see , e . g . , Magua et al . , 2017 ) . We arbitrarily selected the most frequent 30 attributes and created a binary indicator taking a value of 1 if a review included at least one from the list , 0 otherwise . 2 All models included ﬁ xed effects for the year , scienti ﬁ c domains , and research programmes , and a comprehensive set of covariates . We retrieved individual data from the Web of Science ( WoS ) and constructed several consortium - wide bibliometric indicators , includ - ing scienti ﬁ c productivity ( total number of publications of the consortium normalized by the consortium size , in logs ) , participa - tion of highly cited scientists , measures of research diversity and interdisciplinarity ( Blau index ) , cognitive proximity ( share of overlapping WoS subject categories between consortium and evaluators ) and network proximity ( if the consortium and evaluators have at least one common co - author prior to the grant application ) . We also considered other factors that might in ﬂ uence evaluation decisions : the seniority of the consortium ( average age of consortium members , in logs ) , its size and institutional reputation ( whether the consortium includes at least one member af ﬁ liated with a university belonging to the Top 100 Shanghai Ranking ) , partnerships with the private sector ( whether the consortium includes at least one member with a private sector af ﬁ liation ) , the size of the budget requested , experience with previous EUROCORES grants ( whether the consortium includes at least one member having a EUROCORES - granted project prior to application ) , and the number of participating countries within a consortium . Finally , we included some characteristics of the evaluators , including gender , scienti ﬁ c productivity , age , and institutional reputation . We also took into account panel workload and the number of panel members . Full details on variable construction , de ﬁ nitions , and descrip - tive statistics can be found in the SI material ( Tables S1 and S2 ) . Fig . 2 Gender statistics for applicants andevaluators . ‘ Female Presence ’ represents the proportion of consortia with at least one female PI . ‘ Female Share ’ is the proportion of female PIs in consortia or evaluator groups .

At this stage , we modelled the probability for an outline proposal to pass the ﬁ rst panel selection . Our data provide compelling evidence that consortia with a higher proportion of female PIs were at a comparative disadvantage in this ﬁ rst evaluation [ Estimate : − 0 . 213 — std . error : 0 . 081 — p - value < 0 . 01 ] . The most complete model speci ﬁ cation , Table 2 — Column 3 , suggests that a 1 % increase in the share of female scientists signi ﬁ cantly reduced the likelihood of advancing to the second stage by ~ 0 . 2 % . Other factors played a signi ﬁ cant role in selection . For example , consortium size and the number of different participat - ing countries were important determinants of success . Cognitive proximity between applicants and panel experts , along with prior success with EUROCORES applications , also had a positive in ﬂ uence on panel decisions . In contrast , consortia with a diverse research background and in close proximity to the panel members ’ collaboration network were more likely to ﬁ nd their application rejected . Apart from panel size and workload , the other panel characteristics had no signi ﬁ cant impact on their evaluations . Second stage : external reviewers assess FPs . At this stage , full proposals were sent for external review to at least three anon - ymous referees . We considered the average of the scores assigned to the scienti ﬁ c quality of the proposed research and the quali - ﬁ cations of the PIs as a proxy for scienti ﬁ c merit . This approach is justi ﬁ ed as the format of the two questions related to the scienti ﬁ c quality of the proposal and the quali ﬁ cations of the PIs remained unchanged throughout the period , while the format of the other questions underwent some minor changes , making them unsui - table for statistical analysis . We constructed reviewer sentiment measures and drew up a list of evaluative terms for the corpus of reviewers ’ reports , and explored the extent to which scores and language patterns in the reports differed for consortia with a high proportion of female scientists . First , we found a negative relationship between gender and the reviewers ’ scores . Our data , Table 3 — Column 6 , show that a 1 % increase in the proportion of female PIs within a consortium resulted in a 0 . 356 % fall in the scores received [ Estimate : − 0 . 356 — std . error : 0 . 175 — p - value < 0 . 05 ] . The data also con ﬁ rm that teams with greater scienti ﬁ c productivity scored higher , and evaluators penalized consortia closer to their areas of expertise , in line with previous research ( Boudreau et al . , 2016 ) . Second , we found a discrepancy between the scores and the written assessments contained in the reviewers ’ reports . Indeed , the analysis showed that the valence scores of the review corpus were neither positively nor negatively affected by the gender composition of the consortia ( Table 4 ) [ VADER estimate : 0 . 024 — std . error : 0 . 071 — p - value > 0 . 10 ; Presence of evaluative terms : 0 . 042 — std . error : 0 . 091 — p - value > 0 . 10 ] . Hence , sentiment scores as well as the presence of evaluative terms were largely unrelated to review scores . Reviewers did not perceive female PIs as being less competent in their comments ; however , they were negatively sensitive to a high female ratio within a consortium when scoring the proposed research project . These discrepancies between the quantitative ( scores ) and qualitative ( sentiments and evaluative terms ) aspects of the reviewers ’ reports imply that even though evaluation language seems to be similar , consortia with higher share of female PIs had signi ﬁ cantly lower scores . Third stage : expert panels make funding recommendation . At the third stage , we modelled the probability for a ﬁ nal proposal to receive a recommendation for funding . As shown in Table 5 , we found no direct evidence of gender composition of research consortia in panel decisions [ Estimate : − 0 . 089 — standard error : 0 . 191 — p - value > 0 . 10 ] . However , the decisions were strongly associated with the reviewers ’ scores , thus complying with EUROCORES guidelines that state the reviewers ’ reports should be considered as constituting the main basis for evaluations . Yet , we have already seen that the reviewers ’ scores seemed to be biased towards consortia with a higher proportion Table 2 Coef ﬁ cient estimates — First expert panel evaluation .

Besides the gender dimension , the data also show an important positive role of network proximity consistent with ‘ old boy ’ network patterns ( Rose , 1989 ; Travis and Collins , 1991 ) , as identi ﬁ ed in previous studies ( Wenneras and Wold , 1997 ; Sandström and Hällsten , 2008 ) . Discussion In this article , we examined an original dataset from EURO - CORES grants scheme and explored the factors affecting eva - luation outcomes at each stage of the peer - review process . Our analysis reveals a noteworthy interaction between the gender of applicants and peer review outcomes , and provides compelling evidence of a strong negative impact on consortia with a higher representation of female scientists . This gender effect is present in the evaluation outcomes of both panels and external reviewers . Our results also show that there is a mismatch between text and scores in external review reports that runs against consortia with a higher proportion of female PIs . There is a growing body of theoretical and empirical research on gender bias . Biases in judgements are part of human nature and are often the results of some heuristics of thinking under uncertainty ( Tversky and Kahneman , 1974 ) . For example , the heuristic in evaluating a grant proposal may be to rely too heavily on easily perceived characteristics of applicants , which may be effective in part ( think of scienti ﬁ c excellence ) , but prone to producing biases ( Sha ﬁ r and LeBoeuf , 2002 ) . This does not necessarily mean that the bias is intentional ; on the contrary , it may well occur outside of the decision maker ’ s awareness ( Kahneman , 2011 ) .

In the literature , the term implicit bias is often used to refer to such attitudes and stereotypes in general ( Mandelbaum , 2015 ; Frankish , 2016 ) . Overall , the ﬁ ndings reported here add to our understanding of gender bias in science by showing that such bias is not solely directed against the individual , as revealed in previous studies , but that it has a more pervasive effect and can involve groups of individuals too . The sequential nature of the grant evaluation process is designed to help screen proposals and applicants based on scienti ﬁ c merit , with subsequent steps functioning as ‘ ﬁ lters ’ to keep the best proposals alive . However , our results show that precisely because of the sequential nature of the process , gender bias at one stage can indirectly in ﬂ uence decisions at subsequent stages . Although our study emphasized a gender bias in the peer review process , we acknowledge that the effect found could be caused by the concomitance of other factors . Four aspects seem particularly relevant to us . First , the text characteristics of the outline and full proposals . Indeed , we could not measure the quality of the written proposal nor the editing style that might be dependent on the gender composition of a consortium . Although gender bias is a more complex problem than just the differences between men and women in using language , writing style and word choice may have an important impact on grant evaluation and selection processes ( Tse and Hyland , 2008 ; Kolev et al . , 2020 ) . Second , we did not have information on the applicants ’ time allocation in work ( e . g . , teaching and admin - istrative duties ) and family ( e . g . , childcare and housework ) . Third , most EUROCORES projects involved interdisciplinary collaborations ( e . g . , physics and engineering , life and environ - mental sciences , biomedicine , social sciences and humanities ) , which made it impractical to investigate how gender bias varied by scienti ﬁ c macro - area . Finally , we cannot exclude the Table 4 Coef ﬁ cient estimates — external reviewer evaluation ( sentiments and evaluative terms ) .

Future research should address these limitations to achieve a better under - standing of the gendered nature of evaluation in peer - review processes . The EUROCORES Scheme was ended in December 2015 after almost 12 years of activity . However , the lessons learned from this scheme are still relevant today , as there are many similar national and international funding schemes managed by different Research Funding Organizations ( RFOs ) such as the European Research Council ( ERC ) , the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) , the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the French National Research Agency ( ANR ) , and the German Research Foundation ( DFG ) , among others . These RFOs develop and implement assessment procedures similar to EUROCORES that mostly rely on external peer - review and expert panels to determine successful applicants . Our results are , therefore , relevant to policy makers and RFOs . Clearly , we endorse calls for a more equitable grant peer review system in order to avoid all forms of con ﬂ icts of interest , including cognitive , social and other forms of proximity . Anon - ymizing the applicant ’ s pro ﬁ le can only be a partial solution to the problem , and one that may not be particularly effective as the identity of the applicants must be known to the evaluator in order to access their bibliometric indicators , for instance their pub - lication and citation records . A more drastic and , perhaps , more effective approach would be to actually inform panel members and reviewers ex - post about any biases observed in their deci - sions . If the bias exists , then it is there ; there is little that can be done to rectify it . Yet , the taking of such an approach might go some way to increasing an evaluator ’ s awareness and to changing their future behaviour . Data availability We obtained EUROCORES grant records from the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) . EUROCORES data are not publicly available . Codes for data preparation , variable construction , sta - tistical analysis and details on data access are available from the corresponding author upon request and / or on GitHub . Received : 26 May 2021 ; Accepted : 16 May 2022 ; Notes 1 Some technical details about the estimation of word representations are in order . First , we removed all reviewers ’ reports with < 15 words , a pre - de ﬁ ned set of stop words , and all words occurring < 5 times in the corpus . Second , we pasted uni - grams into bi - grams depending on their co - occurence ( threshold equal to 50 ) . Third , we used negative sampling . Hence , we estimated a logit model where the binary dependent variable indicates whether or not two terms are close in the corpus , at distance c . For each observed neighbouring term pair ( success ) , one should add k ‘ negative samples ’ ( failures ) . The results presented along this article were obtained with the following parameter settings . We set the dimensionality of the dense word representation to 512 dimensions ( we tried other dimensions : 256 , 300 , 512 and 1024 ) . We de ﬁ ned a context window ( distance c ) of 7 words from both sides around the target . For each observed neighbouring term pair , we draw k = 15 negative example . 2 Most frequent 30 evaluative terms in reviewers ’ reports : connected internationally ; considerable experience ; excellent track ; highly quali ﬁ ed ; highly respected ; international connection ; international reputation ; international standing ; internationally competitive ; internationally connected ; internationally recognized ; internationally renowned ; leading expert ; leading scientists ; numerous cooperation ; signi ﬁ cant contribution ; track record ; world leader ; world leading ; world renowned .
