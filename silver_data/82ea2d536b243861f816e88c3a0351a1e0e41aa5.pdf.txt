We assessed SARS - CoV - 2 cycle threshold value ( Ct ) from the ﬁrst diagnostic nasal – pharyngeal swab of symptomatic index cases and which demographic or clinical characteristics among cases and contacts are associated with transmission risk within households . Methods : This is a retrospective prevalence study on secondary SARS - CoV - 2 cases ( SC ) among the household contacts of symptomatic adult index cases randomly sampled from all the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs analyzed at our regional referral hospital ( Amedeo di Savoia Hospital , Turin , Italy ) in March , 2020 . Index cases underwent a telephone survey to collect their demographic and clinical data and all their household contacts . The Ct value of RdRp gene from the ﬁrst diagnostic swab of index cases was recorded and index cases were grouped according to Ct tertiles ( A < ﬁrst tertile , ﬁrst ≤ B ≤ second tertile , C ≥ second tertile ) . Post hoc analysis was performed in SC as well as contacts that did not undergo SARS - CoV - 2 testing but developed compatible signs and symptoms . Non - parametric tests and generalized linear models were run . Results : Index ( n = 72 ) and contact ( n = 164 ) median age was 54 ( 48 – 63 ) and 32 ( 20 – 56 ) years , respectively . A total of 60 , 50 , and 54 subjects were contacts of group A , B , and C index cases , respectively ; 35 . 9 % of contacts were SC . Twenty - four further subjects ( 14 . 6 % ) met the criteria for symptom - based likely positive SC . The secondary attack rate was 36 . 0 % ( 28 . 6 – 43 . 4 ) , assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 20 days . SC prevalence differed between Ct groups ( 53 . 3 % A , 32 . 0 % B , 20 . 4 % C ; p < 0 . 001 ) . No difference in SC was found according to sex , presence of signs / symptoms , and COVID - 19 severity of index cases , or according to contacts’ sex and number per household .

Conclusion : In conﬁned transmission settings such as households , PCR Ct values may inform on the contagiousness of infected subjects and age may modulate transmission / contagion risk . Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 , contagiousness , viral load , cycle threshold , transmission risk , age , household INTRODUCTION Since the identiﬁcation of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and the rapid rise of new cases of symptomatic disease by SARS - CoV - 2 ( COVID19 ) all over the world , it has been clear that person - to - person transmission ( Lei et al . , 2020 ; Sun et al . , 2020 ) would have had a key role in the rapid spreading as well as in the containment of what , in March 2020 , the World Health Organization declared as a pandemic . Like most respiratory viral infections , SARS - CoV - 2 spreads mainly through aerosol and droplets ( Meyerowitz et al . , 2020 ) , and transmission is particularly eﬀective in conﬁned indoor spaces ( Marks et al . , 2021 ) . Other transmission routes have been demonstrated ( through fomites , via oral – fecal contamination , or by ocular conjunctiva ) , but data regarding eﬀectiveness and eventually disease development by means of these routes are limited ( Li et al . , 2020 ; Meyerowitz et al . , 2020 ) . A similar heterogeneity has been reported to date in several viral , behavioral , social , climate , and environmental factors Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 829393 fmicb - 13 - 829393 March 28 , 2022 Time : 15 : 14 # 3 Trunﬁo et al . Determinants of SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission aﬀecting SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and subjects’ contagiousness ( Carraturo et al . , 2020 ; Koh et al . , 2020 ; Madewell et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , it was , and it is still clear that properly studying and deﬁning determinants able to signiﬁcantly aﬀect SARS - CoV - 2 onward transmission is challenging . Starting from this challenge , the study of household transmission could be an easier setting to study some of such determinants while controlling for other relevant variables . Yet , so far , few studies investigated factors that may impact SARS - CoV - 2 transmission risk and infectivity in this setting : conﬂicting lines of evidence were generated on this matter . For instance , the impact of index case age is still debated : some studies reported no impact , while others showed opposite conclusion on higher odds of transmission either among people aged less than 20 years or among subjects aged 60 years and above ( Jing et al . , 2020 ; Koh et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) . It is also unclear whether a higher number of household contacts can be a risk factor for increased odds of transmission ( Wang et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , to date , scarce in vivo evidence points toward a higher infectivity of subjects harboring higher viral load in their upper respiratory airways ( Cerami et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) , and no virological marker has been identiﬁed for estimating the contagiousness of SARS - CoV - 2 - infected patients . The issue is of renewed relevance as it is not fully clear to what extent COVID - 19 vaccinated subjects , because of a possible reduced viral load , have a lower probability of transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 when infected compared to those who are not vaccinated ( Levine - Tiefenbrun et al . , 2021 ; Pritchard et al . , 2021 ; Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ; Trunﬁo et al . , 2021d ) . Herein , we sought to assess whether , among demographic and clinical parameters that may aﬀect SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within household contacts of symptomatic index cases , a virological marker represented by the inverse proxy of upper respiratory viral amount , the RT - PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) , associates with transmission odds and could inform about potential transmissibility from infected subjects . MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study on the risk of secondary SARS - CoV - 2 cases among the household contacts of symptomatic adult patients with a SARS - CoV - 2 - positive diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab ( NPs ) analyzed by our regional reference laboratory ( Amedeo di Savoia Hospital , Turin , Italy ) in March , 2020 . Patients were randomly sampled from the sampling frame represented by the 1995 SARS - CoV - 2 - positive NPs ( simple random sampling by random lottery extraction ) . The sampled individuals were reached in August – September 2020 for a telephone survey addressing COVID - 19 - related clinical and demographic characteristics of both the interviewed and all the household contacts , if any . The surveyed data were cross - checked and completed by data extrapolated using the Piedmont platform ( RUPCOVID ) , an online regional database built for SARS - CoV - 2 contact tracing , notiﬁcation ( NPs results and dates ) , and clinical data collection ( demographics , signs and symptoms , date of symptoms onset ) . Recorded signs and symptoms were fever , asthenia , malaise , arthromyalgia , headache , olfactory and gustatory dysfunction , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dyspnea , runny nose , cough , and pharyngitis . The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 was isolated from 300 µ l of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs ( NPs ) collected in Universal Transport Medium for viruses R (cid:13) ( UTM , Copan group , Brescia , Italy ) . Viral RNA was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMag instruments ( bioMérieux , Italia Spa , Bagno a Ripoli , Italy ) , with a ﬁnal elution volume of 50 µ l . Five microliters of RNA was processed with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Real - Time Multiplex PCR ( RT - PCR ) kit ( Liferiver Bio - Tech , San Diego , CA , United States ) , a multiplex TaqMan real - time PCR that targets the following three SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc genes : ORF1ab ( RdRp ) , nucleocapsid ( N ) , and envelope ( E ) . For the purpose of the study , only RdRp Ct values were considered to have one uniform proxy of viral load . All reactions were performed in 7500 Fast thermal cycler ( Applied Biosystems , San Diego , CA , United States ) . RT - PCR results were analyzed with the ABI PRISM manager software . SARS - CoV - 2 - positive ( mixture of plasmids containing partial RdRp , N , and E fragments ) and - negative controls were used for each run . The procedure included an internal control added into the specimen before the RNA extraction phase , to evaluate RNA extraction eﬃciency and the presence of inhibitors . SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR results were considered positive if at least two target genes were ampliﬁed with a Ct of ≤ 40 , inconclusive if only one target was ampliﬁed with a Ct of ≤ 40 , and negative if no gene targets were ampliﬁed or ampliﬁed with a Ct of > 40 after background subtraction . Ct was deﬁned as the number of cycles of ampliﬁcation required for the ﬂuorescence of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR to be detected above the background signal and can be used as a relative inverse proportional measure of viral amount in the specimen . RT - PCR sensitivity was tested against dilution series of virus spiked into negative samples , and the 95 % lower detection limit was determined by probit analysis . For NPs , the 95 % limit of detection was 324 , 213 , and 365 copies / ml for the RdRp , N , and E genes , respectively , as per manufacturer instructions . Speciﬁcity of the RT - PCR procedure has been veriﬁed for non - speciﬁc reactions to other human endemic coronaviruses ( HCoV ) 229E , NL63 , OC43 , and HKU1 as well as MERS - CoV using supernatants from cell culture and none of the virus preparations showed reactivity for any of the three genes of the assay , as per manufacturer evaluation . Data from interviewed subjects meeting the deﬁnition criteria of index case and living with at least another subject were used for the study . Index case was deﬁned as any adult subject with a proved SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( NPs with RdRp Ct value < 40 ) developing COVID - 19 - related signs and / or symptoms at least 5 days before any other subjects living in the same house ( according to the median incubation time ) ( Wassie et al . , 2020 ) . Sampled subjects meeting the deﬁnition of index case but had NPs collected at emergency departments or were already hospitalized were excluded to include only index cases with COVID - 19 onset and relevant attendance at home . Households with asymptomatic secondary cases of index cases for whom Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 829393 fmicb - 13 - 829393 March 28 , 2022 Time : 15 : 14 # 4 Trunﬁo et al . Determinants of SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission an extra - household source of infection was not disclosed ( e . g . , index cases reporting testing due to contacts with known positive subjects outside the household ) were excluded ; this was settled to reduce potential classiﬁcation bias in cases with no datable COVID - 19 onset . The tertiles of the distribution of Ct values from the ﬁrst diagnostic swab were used as cutoﬀs for grouping index cases as follows : Ct < ﬁrst tertile , group A ; ﬁrst tertile ≤ Ct < second tertile , group B ; Ct ≥ second tertile , group C . Household contacts were deﬁned as swab - conﬁrmed secondary cases when the following criteria were met : living in the same household of the index case , of any age , with a SARS - CoV - 2 - positive NPs and , if symptomatic , with the onset of COVID - 19 at least 5 days after the onset in the linked index ( as per index case deﬁnition ) and , if asymptomatic , with the ﬁrst positive NPs collected at least 5 days after the onset of the linked index case . Household contacts developing COVID - 19 - related signs and symptoms or testing positive with or without disease more than 25 days ( 20 + 5 ) from the COVID - 19 onset of the index case were not considered as secondary cases ( according to available data on wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 length of contagiousness potential in cohort including severe disease or immunocompromised subjects + median incubation period ) ( Singanayagam et al . , 2020 ; Wassie et al . , 2020 ; Johansson et al . , 2021 ; Owusu et al . , 2021 ; van Kampen et al . , 2021 ) . A symptom - based PCR strategy could miss up to 62 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infections , as recently reported in a large prospective cohort ( Ng et al . , 2021 ) . Post hoc analysis was performed including also symptoms - based likely positive secondary cases ( deﬁned as contacts living in the same household of the index case , of any age , who did not undergo SARS - CoV - 2 testing or tested negative but eventually developed SARS - CoV - 2 - related signs or symptoms at least 5 days after the onset in the index case ) , to assess whether missing testing for SARS - CoV - 2 in some of the household contacts may have introduced bias . Informed consent was asked and obtained during the phone survey ; those not consenting were not included and their data were not collected . Pseudo - anonymized data were used . The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Inter - departments Ethics Committee A . O . U . Città della Salute e della Scienza , A . O . Ordine Mauriziano di Torino , and A . S . L . Città di Torino ( Torino , Italy , protocol number 0065839 - 00304 / 2020 , July 9 , 2020 ) . For descriptive purposes , we reported the variable distributions of the household contacts and the index subjects separately in each of the three Ct groups of index cases . Categorical variables were presented as absolute numbers and proportions , continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range , and their univariable association with the three Ct groups was tested using non - parametric tests ( Mann – Whitney , Chi - square test for trend , and Kruskal – Wallis ) . To further investigate the relationship between the Ct value of index cases and prevalence of secondary cases among household contacts , we ran a generalized linear model ( log regression for binary outcomes ) , with robust variance and clustering at the household level , which included variables with univariate p - value < 0 . 10 adjusted for age of both index and contacts . The analyses were clustered by household variable to adjust for household - related variables not collected during the survey . The secondary attack rate ( SAR ) was estimated as the proportion of susceptible household contacts that were identiﬁed as secondary SARS - CoV - 2 cases ( for both swab - conﬁrmed and swab - conﬁrmed plus symptoms - based likely positive deﬁnitions ) during the 25 days after COVID - 19 onset in the index case . Data analysis was performed using Stata SE 16 ( StataCorp LLC , TX , United States ) . RESULTS Two - hundred and thirty subjects were sampled , and 200 consented to the survey ; among these , 72 subjects met the criteria for index case and were included in the analyses together with their 164 household contacts . The mean SAR ( 95 % conﬁdence interval ) among the 72 household clusters was 36 . 0 % ( 28 . 6 – 43 . 4 % ) when considering swab - conﬁrmed secondary cases and 55 . 5 % ( 47 . 9 – 63 . 1 % ) when including symptoms - based likely positive secondary cases . Among the index cases , 47 subjects ( 65 . 3 % ) were male and 71 ( 98 . 6 % ) were of European ancestry , with a median age , Ct at diagnosis , number of household contacts , and time from disease onset to diagnostic swab of 54 years ( 48 – 63 ) , 28 . 81 ( 22 . 24 – 33 . 64 ) , 2 ( 1 – 3 ) , and 7 days ( 3 – 10 ) , respectively . Forty - eight index cases ( 66 . 7 % ) required hospital admission for oxygen support due to moderate or severe COVID - 19 ; 24 . 41 and 31 . 79 were the ﬁrst and second tertile of the Ct distribution , resulting in 24 index cases ( 33 . 3 % ) per group as per study methods . Comparisons between index groups in terms of demographic , clinical , and household contact characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The index groups diﬀered in terms of severity of COVID - 19 ( requirement of oxygen support ) and temporal gap between COVID - 19 onset and diagnostic swab collection only ( Table 1 ) . Among household contacts , 65 ( 39 . 6 % ) were male and 148 ( 90 . 2 % ) were of European ancestry , with a median age of 32 years ( 20 – 56 ) . There were 60 ( 36 . 6 % ) , 50 ( 30 . 5 % ) , and 54 ( 32 . 9 % ) contacts of the group A , B , and C , respectively . Ninety - three ( 56 . 7 % ) underwent SARS - CoV - 2 nasal – pharyngeal swab ( 60 were positive ) , of whom 59 ( 35 . 9 % ) met the deﬁnition of secondary case [ median diﬀerence in COVID - 19 onset between secondary and index cases of 5 days ( 5 – 6 ) ] . Among contacts that did not undergo testing ( n = 71 , 43 . 2 % ) , 24 ( 14 . 6 % of the overall contacts ) had signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 . All of them met the criteria for symptom - based likely positive secondary case [ median diﬀerence in time of COVID - 19 onset between secondary and index cases of 6 days ( 5 – 7 ) ] . Eight further patients who underwent swab collection and had negative results but subsequently developed suggestive signs or symptoms were also considered as symptom - based likely positive COVID - 19 cases . As for potential confounders , contacts’ age , ethnicity , and sex , the number of household contacts , and the proportion of contacts undergoing swab collection did not diﬀer between the index groups ( Table 1 ) .

The prevalence of secondary SARS - CoV - 2 infections among household contacts diﬀered according to the Ct value detected in the diagnostic swab of the linked index case , as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1A . Group A had a higher prevalence of secondary cases ( 53 . 3 % ) compared to groups B ( 32 . 0 % , p = 0 . 025 ) and C ( 20 . 4 % , p < 0 . 0005 ) . Considering only household contacts who underwent swab testing , group A ( 84 . 2 % ) had more secondary cases than groups B ( 55 . 2 % , p = 0 . 010 ) and C ( 42 . 3 % , p = 0 . 001 ; Figure 1B ) . Similar results were observed when symptom - based likely positive secondary cases were included in the analysis : group A ( 73 . 3 % ) observed more secondary cases compared to groups B ( 50 . 0 % , p = 0 . 012 ) and C ( 40 . 7 % , p < 0 . 0005 ; Table 1 and Figure 1C ) . We also assessed whether the prevalence of secondary cases ( both swab positives only and swab positives plus symptom - based likely positives ) diﬀered according to age , sex , presence of signs , or symptoms potentially related to increased emission of virions by droplet / aerosol particles or fomite contamination , and COVID - 19 severity of linked index cases or to age , sex , and number of household contacts ( 1 , 2 , 3 , or more than three members ) regardless of Ct stratiﬁcation . No diﬀerence was observed between the groups identiﬁed according to all the considered variables ( data not shown ) , except for both index and contacts’ age stratiﬁed into three groups ( ≤ 45 , 46 – 59 , and ≥ 60 years old ) . In fact , the prevalence of swab positives only and swab positives plus symptom - based likely positive secondary cases signiﬁcantly increased with increasing age of both index cases ( Figures 2A , B ) and household contacts ( Figures 2C , D ) . In multivariable models , index and contacts’ age as well as Ct values of the index were the only independent variable associated with the risk of swab - conﬁrmed secondary cases and swab - conﬁrmed plus symptoms - based likely positive secondary cases within households ( Table 2 ) . Speciﬁcally , older age of both contacts and index cases increased the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission by about three times more in both models for subjects aged 60 years and above compared to 45 years old subjects or younger ( Table 2 ) , while higher Ct values decreased the odds of transmission by 83 and 87 % when group C was compared to group A in the two models , respectively . DISCUSSION Among household clusters during the beginning of the pandemic in a north - western city of Italy , we observed a higher odds of SARS - CoV - 2 onward transmission as age of both symptomatic index cases and contacts increased as well as lower odds of transmission as the Ct value from the ﬁrst diagnostic nasal – pharyngeal swab of index cases increased . The hierarchy of the impact on transmission potential was dominated by Ct values , followed by the age of index cases and of household contacts . Number of contacts , presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of potential higher spread of infectious virions ( such as runny nose , cough , and diarrhea ) , the sex of contacts and index , as well as the overall COVID - 19 severity of the index cases were not found to independently aﬀect transmission risk in the same setting .

Determinants of SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission FIGURE 1 | Prevalence of secondary SARS - CoV - 2 infections among household contacts according to cycle threshold ( Ct ) values from the diagnostic nasal – pharyngeal swab of linked index cases . ( A ) Swab - conﬁrmed secondary cases among all the household contacts stratiﬁed according to index ﬁrst Ct value . ( B ) Swab - conﬁrmed secondary cases among only the household contacts that underwent testing stratiﬁed according to index ﬁrst Ct value . ( C ) Swab - conﬁrmed secondary cases plus symptoms - based likely positive secondary cases among all the household contacts stratiﬁed according to index ﬁrst Ct value . ∗ Comparison with p - value < 0 . 05 is highlighted . Our study increases the amount of emerging evidence in support of a signiﬁcant dose – contagiousness relationship in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics and it positions among those studies in favor of a relevant role of age of both infected and receptive subjects in transmission odds . Whether the dose – infectivity relationship follows an exponential , linear , or logarithmic scale is not clear , and we could not address this question with our study design . Our data provide additional support to the association between PCR Ct values and SARS - CoV - 2 transmission risk that few other groups have observed both in households and in settings with similar prolonged and close contacts such as school and workplace ( Kawasuji et al . , 2020 ; Al Bayat et al . , 2021 ; Cerami et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR is the gold standard diagnostic method for SARS - CoV - 2 infection as per international guidelines , but Ct assessment still shows several pre - analytical ( intrinsic variability on the operator and the tolerance of the patients during swab collection ) and analytical issues ( there is variability in the starting amount of template that inversely correlates with the Ct threshold for each sample , and the use of raw Ct values can understate the dispersion of the measurements ) . In this regard , we have tried to limit ( pre - ) analytical variability using a sampling frame of swabs all analyzed in the same laboratory , with the same assay and during a 1 - month period . Nevertheless , our data aim at supporting evidence on the relationship between the viral amount of the source and the risk of onward transmission among contacts , which is still debated , but we agree with the Infectious Diseases Society of America , the Association of Molecular Pathology , and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry that recommend against using Ct values to guide patient management due to the several limitations associated with reporting Ct values . Of note , viral load of the infecting source also seems to predict COVID - 19 severity and long - term sequelae ( Shah et al . , 2021 ; Trunﬁo et al . , 2021c ) , and a debate on whether they may associate with severity among secondary cases is ongoing . Nevertheless , to date , both in vivo and in vitro data point toward no evidence for such an association ( Brosseau et al . , 2021 ; Cerami et al . , 2021 ; Trunﬁo et al . , 2021a , b ) . It would be advisable to improve an international standardization of assessing and reporting Ct values or SARS - CoV - 2 - RNA viral load , when available , to improve the reliability of these tools in routine applications , to provide further data characterizing the type of mathematical functions regulating the relationship between viral amount , contagiousness , and other SARS - CoV - 2 infection - related features , and perhaps to identify reliable cutoﬀs able to distinguish diﬀerent risk categories . The second tertile of the Ct distribution of our population ( 31 . 79 ) does not diverge so far from what in vitro models detected as a potential cutoﬀ for viral infectivity from human samples to cell cultures , approximately 30 – 35 ( Jeﬀerson et al . , 2020 ; La Scola et al . , 2020 ; Singanayagam et al . , 2020 ; Al Bayat et al . , 2021 ) , and from a recent study reporting a 1 . 5 increased risk among close contacts of index with Ct < 30 compared to those of index with higher Ct ( Al Bayat et al . , 2021 ) . Viral load and cell culture infectivity cannot be translated directly to in vivo contagiousness , but the similarity between the in vitro studies and our real - life data adjusted for several variables that cannot be included in culture models strengthens the evidence of a signiﬁcant drop in transmission potential ( of more than 80 % ) when index sources show early Ct values approaching 30 – 35 or greater values .

The relationship between viral load of the source and the odds of infection in contacts also has further implications . First , this ﬁnding may add a piece to the ongoing debate on whether breakthrough SARS - CoV - 2 infections among vaccinated subjects are less contagious ( Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ) . As evidence on faster declining or reduced peak viral load among breakthrough infections is mounting ( Jacobson et al . , 2021 ; Levine - Tiefenbrun et al . , 2021 ; Pritchard et al . , 2021 ; Singanayagam et al . , 2021 ) , further data demonstrating a dose – infectiousness relationship such as ours could endorse the theory that vaccinated subjects may be less contagious also due to a reduction in their median - in - time viral load . Secondly , proper call to maintaining protective measures even within household should be implemented as face masking can signiﬁcantly reduce transmission by modulating viral shedding ( Goyal et al . , 2021 ) , but fatigue and adherence to such preventive behaviors may more easily fade in this setting as the pandemic continues ( Carlucci et al . , 2020 ) . Besides , considering the early transmission occurrence , further studies are required to assess the timing of implementation ( as well as SARS - CoV - 2 positivity notiﬁcation ) and the most eﬀective preventive practices in similar settings . The association between the age of index cases and infectious potential as well as between the age of contacts and contagion odds is controversial . Some authors reported no association with index’s age ( Madewell et al . , 2021 ) , while others observed SARS - CoV - 2 transmission odds either increasing or decreasing with age of index ( Goldstein et al . , 2021 ; Li et al . , 2021 ; Lee et al . , 2022 ) or contacts only ( Jing et al . , 2020 ; Goldstein et al . , 2021 ; Li et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) . This inconsistency may depend on whether children , asymptomatic infections , and diﬀerent transmission settings were included in the studies . The explanation for what we and others have observed ( Li et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) may depend on both biological and social factors . Age has been described to tightly correlate with SARS - CoV - 2 viral amount , ACE2 - receptor expression / density , and comorbidities , and these last with each other ( Baker et al . , 2021 ; Euser et al . , 2021 ; Fagyas et al . , 2021 ; Trunﬁo et al . , 2021c ) ; therefore , index and contacts’ age may represent merely a proxy of viral amount shedding and receptors’ availability , respectively . Nevertheless , we found that age of both contacts and index may be associated with onward transmission independently from the source’s viral load , and this could be related to Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 829393 fmicb - 13 - 829393 March 28 , 2022 Time : 15 : 14 # 8 Trunﬁo et al .

Indeed , the elderly may require more frequent and longer assistance with proximity physical contacts when chronically or acutely sick . In a household setting , this can be diﬃcult to delegate or avoid despite recommendations on self - isolation among either caregivers or old subjects in need of assistance . Higher SARs of symptomatic index cases compared to asymptomatic cases have been reported ( Koh et al . , 2020 ; Madewell et al . , 2021 ) . While expectoration has been occasionally associated with an increased risk of transmission ( Luo et al . , 2020 ) , in agreement with our ﬁndings and previous negative ﬁndings ( Madewell et al . , 2021 ; Marks et al . , 2021 ) , if SARS - CoV - 2 infection becomes clinically manifest , it seems that further stratiﬁcations according to the presence / absence of speciﬁc signs and symptoms or disease severity do not associate with diﬀerential odds of transmission in conﬁned settings . These negative ﬁndings may suggest a transmission model within the household that could witness a quick attainment of the maximum infectivity potential , where the biologically plausible contribution of increased dispersion of virions may be nuanced by more impactful determinants and that symptomatic cases are more likely to transmit before symptoms onset ( Li et al . , 2021 ) . Our study presents several limitations , such as the limited sample size and the retrospective design . As for the latter , while prospective studies can better address outcomes such as secondary infection rate , there are very few prospective studies with a suﬃciently long follow - up to detect all the actual secondary events . Despite the fact that our data collection at 6 months can be exposed to recall bias , it allowed for a more reliable recollection of all the secondary infections . Furthermore , we have corrected our model for the time between COVID - 19 onset and swab collection to adjust for temporal variations in viral amount . We did not collect data on comorbidities , domestic relations , or features of the home environment , and our population was mainly represented by white / Caucasian subjects ; all these variables may aﬀect transmission dynamics . We partially limited this data gap by clustering the analyses at the household level and including age ( proxy of comorbidity ) in the model . Our study population belongs to March 2020 and considered only symptomatic index ; therefore , any conclusion on transmission determinants may not apply to asymptomatic infections , SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concerns , or current households where naturally or vaccine - induced immunized people and proper adherence to clear transmission mitigation strategies should modify what we have described in a naïve population exposed to wild - type virus free of behaving and circulating as naturally as possible . While preliminary ﬁndings align with ours ( Marc et al . , 2021 ; Lee et al . , 2022 ) , further data on the predictive role of initial viral load in the onward transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concerns are warranted . Lastly , 23 . 8 % of the overall population of contacts could have included asymptomatic infections that were not detected by our assessment strategy and criteria for secondary cases . We have also observed a relatively high SAR ( 36 . 0 % ) . While it may have been underestimated due to the only partial contact testing , an overestimation could have been introduced too , as we cannot rule out that some of the classiﬁed secondary infections were incubating the infection for a longer period than the attributed index . However , the detected SAR is in line with other reports during the same period and setting in countries heavily hit during the ﬁrst wave as Italy , when no previous seroprotection , vaccination , and adherence to certain protective measures were in place ( Boscolo - Rizzo et al . , 2020 ; Koh et al . , 2020 ; Cerami et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , this value could be explained by the longer temporal criteria we adopted to deﬁne secondary infections ( within 25 days ) compared to prospective studies with shorter follow - up .

Determinants of SARS - CoV - 2 Transmission CONCLUSION Identifying determinants that play a role in the risk of transmitting and / or acquiring SARS - CoV - 2 is relevant to inform and execute public health strategies ; reducing the transmission chain using tailored strategies may be needed in order to save human and economic resources while improving eﬀectiveness . For this purpose , the role of viral load quantiﬁcation from early diagnostic NPs in diﬀerentiating infectiousness potential deserves further studies beyond the assessment of a proxy variable such as Ct values , as well as the reasons underlying higher transmissivity and sensitivity to SARS - CoV - 2 infection among older infected subjects and contacts , respectively .
