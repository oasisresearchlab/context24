To better understand how kinetochores attach to microtubules and how this attachment is regulated , we sought to characterize the interactions among kinetochore proteins , especially with respect to the microtubule - binding Dam1 complex . The Dam1 complex plays a crucial role in the chromo - some - spindle attachment and is a key target for phospho - regulation of this attachment by the Aurora kinase Ipl1p . To identify protein – protein interactions involving the Dam1 complex , and the effects of Dam1p phosphorylation state on these physical interactions , we conducted both a genome - wide two - hybrid screen and a series of biochemical binding assays for Dam1p . A two - hybrid screen of a library of 6000 yeast open reading frames identiﬁed nine kinetochore proteins as Dam1p - interacting partners . From 113 in vitro binding reactions involving all nine subunits of the Dam1 complex and 32 kinetochore proteins , we found at least nine interactions within the Dam1 complex and 19 potential partners for the Dam1 complex . Strikingly , we found that the Dam1p – Ndc80p and Dam1p – Spc34p interactions were weakened by mutations mimick - ing phosphorylation at Ipl1p sites , allowing us to formulate a model for the effects of phospho - regulation on kinetochore function . INTRODUCTION To be faithfully segregated during mitosis , duplicated eu - karyotic chromosomes must ﬁrst form bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle . The DNA - microtubule attachment occurs at a specialized multiprotein structure called the ki - netochore . To date , (cid:1) 40 kinetochore proteins have been identiﬁed in budding yeast ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002b ) . Given the molecular complexity of the kinetochore and its essential role in chromosome segregation , it is important to under - stand both how the kinetochore is organized and how it is regulated . Recently , phosphorylation by the Ipl1 protein kinase was shown to play an important role in regulating the structure and function of the yeast kinetochore ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ; Tanaka et al . , 2002 ) . Ip11p is the founding member of the Aurora kinase family ( Chan and Botstein , 1993 ) , members of which function in chromosome segrega - tion from yeast to metazoans ( Shannon and Salmon , 2002 ) . The nine - subunit Dam1 complex is required for both chro - mosome segregation and spindle integrity . Mutational anal - ysis of phosphorylation sites in Dam1p clearly demonstrated its role as a key Ipl1 target in vivo ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . However , it was unclear what the molecular consequences of this phosphorylation were . One possible effect of Ipl1p phosphorylation could be to change the physical interac - tions of Dam1p via phosphorylation . Because the phosphor - ylation state of the Dam1 complex does not affect its micro - tubule - binding activity or subunit composition ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) , we sought to identify other physical interac - tions of the Dam1 complex at the kinetochore and to deter - mine whether they are affected by Ipl1 phosphorylation . Despite the discovery of centromeric DNA - binding com - ponents and microtubule - binding components within the kinetochore , how the (cid:1) 40 kinetochore proteins establish the Article published online ahead of print .

DC1 Supplemental Material can be found at : complete connectivity from the DNA to the microtubule is not known . The current understanding of yeast kinetochore organization is primarily derived from two - hybrid interac - tions , coimmunoprecipitation ( coIP ) , and copuriﬁcation ex - periments . The coIP and copuriﬁcation experiments have provided a powerful means to group kinetochore proteins into discrete subcomplexes , such as the nine - subunit Dam1 complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a , 2002a ; Janke et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) , the four - subunit Ndc80 complex ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , the four - subunit CBF3 complex ( Lechner and Carbon , 1991 ) , and the 12 - subunit Ctf19 complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . Two - hybrid studies have provided additional information about how kineto - chore proteins are organized within the subcomplexes and how different subcomplexes are connected to each other ( Ortiz et al . , 1999 ; Ito et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Ortiz and Lechner , 2000 ; Uetz et al . , 2000 ; Janke et al . , 2001 ) . However , two - hybrid information is lacking for many proteins , and two - hybrid interactions can be mediated by intermediary pro - teins . To examine both the organization of proteins within the kinetochore and the role that phosphorylation plays in the regulation of these protein – protein interactions , we took a dual approach . We conducted a genome - wide two - hybrid screen by using Dam1p as a bait , and we examined Dam1p’s direct physical interactions in vitro . To test the effect of phosphorylation on these physical interactions , we also car - ried out a genome - wide two - hybrid screen with the Dam1p mutants that reﬂect the dephosphorylated or constitutively phosphorylated state and conﬁrmed the results by in vitro binding assays . Herein , we present a protein interaction map of the yeast kinetochore focusing on those interactions sur - rounding the Dam1 complex , and we identify a potential mechanism for its phosphoregulation by Ipl1 kinase . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids , Yeast Strains , and Growth Conditions The plasmids and the yeast strains used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively . Yeast media were prepared as de - scribed previously ( Burke et al . , 2000 ) . Synthetic medium ( SM ) with appropriate nutrients , and yeast extract / peptone medium ( YP ) were supplemented with 2 % glucose or with 2 % rafﬁnose or 2 % galactose , as indicated . G418 ( Mediatech , Herndon , VA ) was used at 0 . 4 mg / ml . Two - Hybrid Assays For the genome - wide two - hybrid screens , wild - type DAM1 , dam1 mutated to remove all of the phosphorylation sites ( dam1 S to A ) , and dam1 mutated to mimic the fully Ipl1 - phosphorylated state ( dam1 S to D ) were cloned into the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector pOBD2 ( Yeast Resource Center , Seattle , WA ) and two - hybrid screens were performed as described previously ( Uetz et al . , 2000 ) . Genes to be tested directly in the two - hybrid assays were cloned into the DNA binding domain vector ( pOBD2 , the baits ) or the activation domain vector ( pOAD , the preys ) . The baits were ex - pressed in PJ69 - 4 (cid:1) strain and the preys were expressed in PJ69 - 4a strain . The positive interactions were detected by selection on syn - thetic complete medium lacking leucine , tryptophan , and histidine , and containing 3 mM 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . All of the vectors and yeast strains are available from the Yeast Resource Center ( Seattle , WA ) . Puriﬁcation of Glutathione S - Transferase ( GST ) - Fusion Proteins from Bacteria GST - fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) from the vector pGAT2 ( Peranen et al . , 1996 ) . The bacteria were grown at 37°C until the OD 600 reached 0 . 5 and were then induced with 0 . 4 mM isopropyl (cid:2) - d - thiogalactoside at 28°C for 4 h . The cell pellet was washed with water and resuspended in HEK - T buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 100 mM KCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) and protease inhibitors . The cells were lysed with lysozyme , sonicated three times for 30 s , and centrifuged in an SA - 600 rotor at 10 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C . The supernatant was passed through a glutathione - agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) column , and the bound GST - fusion pro - teins were eluted in elution buffer ( 20 mM glutathione , 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 120 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and dialyzed into HEK - T . Puriﬁcation of GST - Fusion Proteins from Yeast GST - fusion proteins were expressed from pEG ( KT ) ( Mitchell et al . , 1993 ) under the galactose - inducible promoter and puriﬁed from DDY1810 as described previously ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . The yeast cells were induced with galactose at 30°C for 8 h , harvested , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C . Cell pellets were lysed in liquid nitrogen in a Waring Blender and thawed in HEK - T buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 100 mM KCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , with 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitors . The lysate was sonicated four times for 30 s each time , and centrifuged in an SA - 600 rotor at 10 , 000 rpm for 20 min . The supernatant was ﬁltered through cheese - cloth and passed over SP Sepharose Fast Flow ( Amersham Bio - sciences , Piscataway , NJ ) for GST - Duo1p , GST - Dam1p , GST - Spc34p , and GST - Ndc80p , or Q Sepharose Fast Flow ( Amersham Biosciences ) for GST - Ask1p . Bound GST - fusion proteins were eluted with 40 ml of HEK500 - T buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 500 mM KCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , and the eluate was bound to glutathione - agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Finally , GST - fusion proteins were eluted in elution buffer ( 20 mM glutathione , 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 120 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and dialyzed into HEK - T . The protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce Chemical , Rockford , IL ) by using bovine serum albumin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) as a standard . To ensure that each puriﬁed GST - fusion protein did not bring along other components in the complex , we performed immuno - blots on the six GST - fusion proteins and tested for the presence of copurifying endogenous Duo1p and Dam1p with the respective antibodies . There was no detectable Duo1p or Dam1p present in the puriﬁed GST - Spc34p and GST - Ask1p , no Duo1p in the puriﬁed GST - Dam1p , and no Dam1p in the puriﬁed GST - Duo1p ( GST - Spc19p was puriﬁed from E . coli ) ( our unpublished data ) . Therefore , the GST pull - down results reﬂected the direct binding between any of the two subunits . Puriﬁcation of Calmodulin Binding Peptide ( CBP ) - Fusion Proteins from Yeast DAD1 , DAD2 , DAD3 , and DAD4 genes were cloned into pDD1016 ( a generous gift of Erin O’Shea , University of California , San Fran - cisco , San Francisco , CA ) to overexpress CBP - TEV - ProA fusions under the Gal promoter . The proteins were puriﬁed according to the tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation method as described previously ( Rigaut et al . , 1999 ) , with the following modiﬁcation . The frozen yeast cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 50 mM bis - Tris propane pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM EDTA , 5 mM EGTA , 10 % glyecerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM PMSF , 1 (cid:3) protease inhibitor mixture ) . The lysate was sonicated at three times for 50 s and centrifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 20 min in an SA - 600 rotor . The supernatant was adjusted to 400 mM KCl , and 1 ml of IgG agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added . After binding for 3 h at 4°C , the resin was washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer ( plus 400 mM Dam1p Complex Vol . 14 , August 2003 3343 Table 1 .

Finally , the calmodulin beads ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) with bound proteins were washed with calmodulin binding buffer ( 10 mM (cid:2) - mercaptoethanol , 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM Mg - acetate , 1 mM imidazole , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 ) and the beads were used in the binding reactions . All steps were carried out at 4°C . Puriﬁcation of the Dam1p Complex and Ndc80 Complex The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes were puriﬁed as described previ - ously ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a , 2002a ) . General Immunoblot Procedures Immunoblot analysis was performed using standard SDS - PAGE , and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Protran BA83 ; Schleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) . Membranes were blocked for 1 h with Tris - buffered saline / 0 . 05 % Tween 20 containing 5 % nonfat milk , followed by overnight incubation with afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies .

Anti - rabbit horserad - ish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Amersham Biosi - cences ) were used at a dilution of 1 : 5000 . In Vitro - coupled Transcription / Translation Genes to be in vitro transcribed / translated were cloned into an E . coli expression vector , pBAT4 ( Peranen et al . , 1996 ) .

The rest of the dataset is included in the Supplemental Table 1 . Ndc80p as an activation domain hybrid appears as a mid - frequency false positive in the genome - wide two - hybrid assay and could not be reliably used to assess interactions with the Dam1 baits . There - fore , the results shown here reﬂect the combination of using Ndc80p as a DNA binding domain fusion and Dam1 proteins as activation domain hybrids . Dad3 and Dad4 , the two recently identiﬁed subunits of the Dam1 complex , were not included in the genome - wide array . Therefore , their two - hybrid interactions with Dam1p were not tested . Two - hybrid interactions that had been reported in previous studies are referenced with superscript letters . The references are listed below . Table notes : blank cells represent no interactions . “weak” indicates the protein shows weak interaction with wild - type or mutant Dam1p . Sources of the identiﬁed interactions are as follows : a ( Uetz et al . , 2000 ) ; b ( Ito et al . , 2001 ) ; c ( Hofmann et al . , 1998 ) ; d ( Kang et al . , 2001 ) .

Dam1p Complex Vol . 14 , August 2003 3345 and the images were analyzed using ImageQuant version 1 . 2 soft - ware ( Amersham Biosciences ) . To determine binding afﬁnities for interactions involving wild - type or mutant Dam1p , the in vitro - coupled transcription / transla - tion ( IVT ) prespun supernatant was diluted 1 : 1 with HEK - T buffer . Diluted IVT ( 10 (cid:3) l ) was mixed with 10 (cid:3) l of GST - Dam1p ( range 0 . 35 – 9 . 5 (cid:3) M ) or 10 (cid:3) l of 10 (cid:3) M GST , and incubated for 20 min at room temperature . Glutathione - agarose beads ( 30 (cid:3) l , 50 % slurry in HEK - T ) were added to the reaction and incubated for 20 min with occasional mixing at room temperature . After the incubation , the supernatant and beads were separated by centrifugation and sub - sequently handled as describe above . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Immunoprecipitation of formaldehyde cross - linked chromatin was performed essentially as described previously ( Enquist - Newman et al . , 2001 ) . Afﬁnity - puriﬁed rabbit anti - Duo1p antibody ( 1 . 2 mg / ml ) was used at a 1 : 200 dilution . Afﬁnity - puriﬁed guinea pig anti - Dam1p antibody ( 1 mg / ml ) was used at a dilution of 1 : 150 . Afﬁnity - puriﬁed rabbit anti - Ndc80p ( 8 . 2 mg / ml ) antibody was used at a dilution of 1 : 1500 . Immune complexes were isolated on protein A - Sepharose CL - 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) reactions were ampliﬁed using BioExact DNA polymerase ( Bioline , Randolph , MA ) for 24 cycles . PCR products were resolved on 2 . 5 % agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide . Stained PCR products were imaged with a Gel Doc 1000 system ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and quantiﬁed using ImageQuant image analysis software ( Amersham Biosciences ) . RESULTS A Genome - Wide Two - Hybrid Screen for Dam1p - interacting Proteins To provide a context for understanding the function and regulation of the Dam1 spindle / kinetochore complex , we ﬁrst focused on its microtubule - binding subunit Dam1p , which is a critical in vivo target of the Ipl1 kinase ( Cheese - man et al . , 2002a ) . We began by conducting a yeast two - hybrid screen against a genome - wide array of (cid:5) 6000 yeast open reading frames ( Uetz et al . , 2000 ) by using Dam1p as a bait . For these studies , we cloned wild - type DAM1 into the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector pOBD2 . Positives identi - ﬁed in the genome - wide screen were combined into a single microarray for further studies ( see below ) . Screens using both the genome - wide array and the microarray were per - formed at least twice . The results from these screens are summarized in Table 3 ( second column ) and in Supplemen - tary Table 1 . Nine out of 26 interacting proteins identiﬁed were components of the spindle or kinetochore . The other proteins are either relevant ones that had not previously been shown to have related functions , or could be false - positives ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Of the nine interacting spindle or kinetochore proteins identiﬁed , six are subunits of the Dam1 complex . The iden - tiﬁcation of two - hybrid interactions with multiple subunits of the Dam1 complex is consistent with the tight association of these proteins observed during Dam1 complex puriﬁca - tion ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ; Janke et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) , and with the interactions identiﬁed during previous ge - nome - wide two - hybrid analyses ( Ito et al . , 2000 ; Uetz et al . , 2000 ; Ito et al . , 2001 ) . It is important to note that not all of these interactions are necessarily direct ; they may be bridged by other subunits of the Dam1 complex . Interactions were also identiﬁed with a number of other components of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochore . These proteins in - clude Ndc80p , Sli15p , and Bim1p . Although the former two kinetochore proteins were reported to interact with Dam1p ( Ito et al . , 2001 ; Kang et al . , 2001 ) , the microtubule - associated Bim1p was reported to interact with Duo1p ( Uetz et al . , 2000 ; Ito et al . , 2001 ) , which in turn interacts with Dam1p . In summary , the present and previous two - hybrid studies ( Ta - ble 3 ) indicate that the Dam1 complex makes numerous physical interactions at the spindle and kinetochore . Direct Binding Assays for Dam1 Complex Protein – Protein Interactions The genome - wide two - hybrid study with Dam1p as bait identiﬁed six subunits of the Dam1 complex . To determine which of these interactions reﬂects direct protein – protein interactions and to learn more about the subunit organiza - tion of the Dam1 complex , we tested for direct physical interactions among the nine subunits of this complex by using an in vitro binding assay ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . For this binding assay , one subunit in the form of a GST or CBP fusion protein ( Figure 1 , A and B ) was bound to the glutathione - agarose ( or calmodulin - Sepharose ) beads and tested for its ability to pull down a second subunit that was translated in vitro . Puriﬁed GST protein was used as a control to ensure that the binding was not mediated through the GST portion of the fusion protein . As seen in Figure 1C , GST did not interact with any of the subunits of the Dam1 complex , although association with trace amounts of IVT - Spc34p and IVT - Spc19p was observed . The results for 81 in vitro binding reactions involving the nine subunits of the Dam1 complex , and the corresponding two - hybrid in - formation , are shown in Figure 1 , C and D , and summarized in Figure 2A . Five pairs of two - hybrid interactions were conﬁrmed in reciprocal binding assays as were the self - interactions of Dam1p and Duo1p ( Figure 1C ) . Other novel interactions identiﬁed included the self - interaction of Spc34p ( Figure 1C ) , and the interaction between Dad1p and Dad3p , which was also conﬁrmed reciprocally ( Figure 1D ) . However , using this assay , we did not identify signiﬁcant interactions for Ask1p , Dad2p , or Dad4p . The absence of interactions with Ask1p , Dad2p , and Dad4p might suggest that these proteins require multiple subunits to become ac - tive or to form a binding interface . This hypothesis is sup - ported by the observation that Ask1p , Dad2p , and Dad4p seem to form a subcomplex when multiple subunits of the Dam1 complex are coexpressed ( Miranda and Harrison , un - published data ) . Together with the two - hybrid data , these binding assays have identiﬁed multiple physical interactions within the Dam1 complex . From the two complementary analyses , we propose the following model for interactions within the Dam1p complex ( Figure 2A ) . Strikingly , several proteins seem to make multiple connections with other subunits in the complex . This extensive network of interactions might generate the extremely tight association observed for sub - units of this complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ) . Components of Dam1 Complex Interact with Many Kinetochore , Spindle , and Regulatory Proteins Previous studies indicated that the Dam1 complex functions in spindle integrity and is critical for the attachment of C . Shang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3346 kinetochores to microtubules ( Hofmann et al . , 1998 ; Jones et al . , 1999 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2001a , b ; Janke et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) . Both the spindle and the kinetochore are complex proteinaceous structures , and the functions of the Dam1 complex may require interactions with other proteins on the spindle and at the kinetochore . The two - hybrid data pre - sented above , together with data derived from previous studies , suggest that the Dam1 complex may interact with the Ndc80 and the Ctf19 complexes at the kinetochore and interact with Bim1p along the spindle or at the kinetochore ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . As mentioned above , the two - hybrid information is lacking or incomplete for many kinet - ochore proteins ( Supplementary Table 3 , two - hybrid as - says ) , and the two - hybrid analyses may not represent direct association of prey and bait proteins , especially because all of the kinetochore and spindle proteins are present in the nucleus . Therefore , we took a systematic approach to test for direct physical interactions between the Dam1 complex and 32 other kinetochore , spindle , and mitotic checkpoint - re - lated proteins . Each protein was expressed by in vitro cou - pled transcription / translation and then tested for interac - tions in the binding assay . The binding assays were carried out as described above by using puriﬁed GST - Dam1p . The results for 32 protein combinations are shown in Figure 2B and in Supplementary Table 2 ( the binding assays ) . It has been demonstrated that Ndc80p is required for the association of the Dam1 complex with the kinetochore ( Janke et al . , 2002 ) . In our binding assay , Ndc80p was the only protein in the four - subunit Ndc80 complex that showed binding with Dam1p ( Figure 2B , Ndc80 complex ) . In con - trast , multiple interactions between the Dam1 and Ctf19 complexes were observed using this assay . Of the eight proteins of the 12 - subunit Ctf19 complex tested , four were able to bind to Dam1p ( Figure 2B , Ctf19 complex ) . These Figure 1 .

Dam1p Complex Vol . 14 , August 2003 3347 data differ from those obtained in the two - hybrid studies in which only two interactions ( Spc34p - Mcm22p and Dam1p - Mcm16p , see Supplementary Table 2 ) were identiﬁed be - tween these two complexes . Nevertheless , our results are consistent with the fact that numerous genetic interactions between dam1 - 1 and mutants of the Ctf19 complex have been detected ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ) . Surprisingly , despite the lack of previous reports of a physical interaction between the Dam1 complex and the DNA - binding CBF3 complex , we found that Ndc10p , Ctf13p , and Cep3p of the CBF3 complex were pulled down by GST - Dam1p ( Figure 2B ) . Although a role for this inter - action remains to be determined , a genetic interaction has been reported between ask1 - 3 and ndc10 - 1 ( Li et al . , 2002 ) . The in vitro binding assays also identiﬁed interactions between the Dam1 complex and other kinetochore or spin - dle proteins that did not belong to a discrete subcomplex ( Figure 2B ) . The potential partners include the histone H3 - like Cse4p , the microtubule - associated Bim1p , and Stu2p . Among these , Bim1p has been shown to interact with Dam1p in our two - hybrid screen . Additional proteins that are localized at the kinetochore and that serve a regulatory role include the Ipl1 complex and the mitotic checkpoint proteins . At the restrictive tem - perature , duo1 and dam1 mutants showed a mitotic check - point - dependent G2 / M arrest and there were genetic inter - actions between checkpoint mutants and both duo1 and dam1 mutants ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001b ) . Using the in vitro binding assays , we found that Dam1p interacted with four kinetochore - associated checkpoint proteins and with Bub2p ( Figure 2B ) . The physical and genetic interactions between the Dam1 and Ipl1 kinase complexes have been well docu - Figure 2 .

MT , microtubules . C . Shang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3348 mented ( Kang et al . , 2001 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . In addi - tion to conﬁrming the binding between Dam1p and Ipl1p / Sli15p ( Kang et al . , 2001 ) , we found that Dam1p bound directly to Bir1p , recently shown to be a component of the Ipl1 complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . Because there is a genetic interaction between b ir1 (cid:4) and dam1 - 1 mutants , Bir1p may be involved in mediating the effects of Ipl1 kinase on the Dam1 complex . Intact Dam1 Complex Interacts with Components of the Ndc80 , CBF3 , and Ctf19 Complexes and with Cse4p Although many physical interactions were identiﬁed as de - scribed above , one possibility is that the interactions be - tween Dam1p and the Ndc80 , CBF3 , and Ctf19 complexes occurred because puriﬁed Dam1p has exposed domains that are not normally accessible to solvent when Dam1p is present in the Dam1 complex . Therefore , we puriﬁed the intact Dam1 complex from yeast extracts and tested it for interactions with components of the Ndc80 , CBF3 , and Ctf19 complexes . As shown in Figure 3 , the Dam1 complex was able to pull down in vitro translated Ndc80p of the Ndc80 complex , Ndc10p and Ctf13p of the CBF3 complex , Okp1p and Ctf19p of the Ctf19 complex , and the histone H3 - like Cse4p . The DNA - binding protein Cbf1p was included as a negative control ; it did not bind to the Dam1 complex , similar to the results obtained using puriﬁed GST - Dam1p . We further demonstrated that the interactions were not due to nonspeciﬁc coiled - coil interactions because none of these proteins showed interactions with a cell cortex protein , Sla2p , which possesses a large coiled - coil region ( Figure 3 ) . Interactions of Dam1 and Ndc80 Complexes in the Yeast Extracts To further verify the physical interactions described above , we attempted to coimmunoprecipitate the Dam1 complex and interacting proteins from yeast extracts . However , Ndc80p was not found in the immunoprecipitates of Duo1p , Dam1p , Dad1p - 13myc , Dad1p - GFP , and vice versa . These results were similar to the observation of Janke et al . ( 2002 ) who demonstrated that the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are discrete . Nonetheless , we found evidence for association of the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes during early steps of their puriﬁcation by afﬁnity chromatography under low salt con - ditions ( 100 mM KCl ) . Cell extracts of a Dad1p - tagged strain ( Dad1p - S tag - ZZ ) were incubated with IgG - Sepharose to enrich for the Dam1 complex on beads . Although the ma - jority of Ndc80p was in the ﬂow through , we detected Ndc80p on the IgG beads in a Dam1 complex - dependent manner ( Figure 4 , lanes 4 and 5 ) . Similar results were ob - tained in a reciprocal experiment by using cell extracts of an Spc24p - tagged strain . Although the Ndc80 complex was enriched on IgG beads , a small amount of Dam1p was also found associated with the beads . The association of Dam1p depended on the presence of the Ndc80 complex ( Figure 4 , lanes 4 and 6 ) and was disrupted under high salt conditions ( 300 mM KCl ) ( our unpublished data ) . A Genome - Wide Two - Hybrid Screen with dam1 ( SA ) and dam1 ( SD ) Mutants as Baits With at least 40 proteins at the kinetochore and a web of potential interactions that exist among them , it is important to not only identify interactions among the proteins but also to determine how the interactions are regulated . To deter - mine whether Dam1p phosphorylation affects any of the physical interactions of the Dam1 complex described above , we conducted a second genome - wide two - hybrid screen by using dam1 phosphorylation site mutants . For these studies , we used a dam1 mutant , which has all of the known Ipl1p phosphorylation sites removed ( S20A , S257A , S265A , S292A ; designated as S to A ) , and a dam1 mutant , which mimics the constitutively phosphorylated state ( S20D , S257 , S265D , S292D ; designated as S to D ) ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) , as the DNA - binding hybrid , and screened against a library of (cid:5) 6000 yeast open reading frames , each expressed as an activation domain fusion protein ( Table 3 ) . Previous studies on the Dam1 complex puriﬁed from yeast extracts suggested that its subunit composition was unaffected by the phos - phorylation state ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001 ) . Consistent with this conclusion , dam1p ( S to A ) showed the same physical interactions with subunits of the Dam1 complex as the wild - type Dam1p . dam1p ( S to D ) also showed a similar range of interactions ; however , the strength of the interactions with Dad2p and Spc34p seemed reduced compared with wild type . These results suggest that the physical interactions within the Dam1 complex remain largely unchanged in vivo regardless of phosphorylation state , although interactions with Spc34p and Dad2p may be altered . In vivo , Ipl1p associates in a trimeric complex with the inner centromere protein ( INCENP ) - related protein Sli15p and the survivin - like protein Bir1p ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , although we observed direct binding interac - tions between Dam1 and all three components of the Ipl1 complex , we only found two - hybrid interactions between Figure 3 . Intact Dam1 complex binds to com - ponents of the Ndc80 , CBF3 , and Ctf19 com - plexes . Six proteins translated in vitro were pulled down by intact Dam1 complex immobi - lized on the S - agarose beads ( top ) . None of these proteins associated with the S - agarose beads alone ( middle ) or with the coiled - coil rich GST - Sla2p ( bottom ) . Cbf1p was included as a negative control because it did not bind to ei - ther GST - Duo1p or GST - Dam1p . Each binding reaction contained (cid:5) 2 . 6 nmol of Dam1 complex on the beads and was carried out in duplicate . S , supernatant ; B , S - agarose beads . Dam1p Complex Vol . 14 , August 2003 3349 wild - type Dam1p and Sli15p . In addition , although wild - type Dam1p interacted strongly with Sli15p , neither dam1p ( S to A ) nor dam1p ( S to D ) showed an interaction with Sli15p . Finally , we also identiﬁed a variety of physical interac - tions between Dam1p and components of the kinetochore and the mitotic spindle including Ndc80p , Bim1p , and Mcm16p . Interestingly , all of these interactions were affected by phosphorylation state . Bim1p failed to interact with the S to D form of Dam1p , whereas Mcm16p interacted speciﬁ - cally with dam1p ( S to D ) , but not with wild - type Dam1p or dam1p ( S to A ) . Ndc80p as an activation domain hybrid occurs as a mid - frequency false positive in the genome - wide two - hybrid assay and could not be reliably used to assess interactions with the Dam1p DNA - binding domain mutants . Therefore , we generated a fusion of the DNA - binding do - main and Ndc80p . Under this condition , Ndc80p showed positive interactions with both the wild - type and S to A form of Dam1p , but not with the S to D form of Dam1p . In summary , these results suggest that the phosphorylation state of the Dam1 complex may function in part to control physical interactions with other proteins . Phosphorylation Affects Dam1p Interactions In Vitro The two - hybrid screen with dam1 phosphorylation site mu - tants suggested that a subset of physical interactions made by Dam1p are affected by its phosphorylation state . We sought to verify these effects by using in vitro binding as - says . We ﬁrst tested the phosphorylation dependency of the Dam1p – Sli15p and Dam1p – Mcm16p interactions as sug - gested by the two - hybrid results . In contrast to our two - hybrid results ( Table 3 ) , we found that IVT - Sli15p bound to both the wild - type GST - Dam1p and the S to D mutant with the same afﬁnity ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) and that IVT - Mcm16p bound to neither the wild - type nor the S to D mutant of Dam1p ( Supplementary Figure 1C ) . Next , we tested the interaction between puriﬁed intact Ndc80 complex and IVT wild - type Dam1p , dam1p ( S to A ) , and dam1p ( S to D ) mutants . Strikingly , with 3 nmol of Ndc80 complex bound to the S - agarose beads , wild - type Dam1p showed at least 5 . 5 times greater binding to Ndc80 complex than did the dam1p ( S to D ) mutant ( Figure 5 ) . With half of the amount of Ndc80 complex on the beads , the dam1p ( S to D ) mutant showed a twofold reduction in binding compared with wild - type Dam1p ( our unpublished data ) . On the other hand , the dam1p ( S to A ) mutant con - sistently showed virtually identical binding as the wild type Dam1p ( Figure 5 ) . These binding data support the conclu - sion that constitutive Dam1p phosphorylation weakens the interaction between Dam1p and Ndc80p . Furthermore , we compared the binding afﬁnity between IVT - Ndc80p and wild - type GST - Dam1p and the S to D mutant . Using 0 . 14 (cid:3) M of the GST fusion proteins , wild - type Dam1p bound twice as much IVT Ndc80p as the S to D mutant ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . We also tested the phos - phorylation - dependent interaction between Dam1p and Spc34p , another protein that showed decreased interaction with dam1p ( S to D ) mutant in our two - hybrid screen . Similar to Ndc80p , more IVT Spc34p was pulled down by wild - type Dam1p than by the S to D mutant when the concentration of GST fusion proteins was below 1 (cid:3) M ( Sup - plementary Figure 1A ) . To ensure that the differences in the binding afﬁnities with Ndc80p and Spc34p were due to the phosphorylation site mutations and were not due to confor - mational changes induced by multiple mutations in Dam1p , we tested the interaction between Dam1p and Duo1p , which was not affected by those mutations in the two - hybrid screen . We found that IVT - Duo1p bound to both the wild - type GST - Dam1p and the S to D mutant to the same extent at all concentrations tested ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . Therefore , we conclude that the binding afﬁnity between Dam1p and Ndc80p , and between Dam1p and Spc34p , is speciﬁcally reduced by Dam1p phosphorylation . These data corroborate our two - hybrid ﬁndings . The observation that Figure 4 . Coprecipitation of the Dam1 com - plex and the Ndc80 complex from cell ex - tracts . Ndc80p coprecipitated with the Dam1 complex on IgG - Sepharose beads in the cell extracts of a Dad1p - tagged strain ( Dad1p - S tag - ZZ ) , but not in the cell extracts of an un - tagged strain . Similarly , Dam1p coprecipi - tated with the Ndc80 complex on IgG beads in the cell extracts of an Spc24p - tagged strain ( Spc24p - S tag - ZZ ) , but not in the cell extracts of an untagged strain . Cell extracts from all three strains were prepared under identical conditions as described in the puriﬁcation of Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes ( see MATERI - ALS AND METHODS ) , except that the cell extracts were maintained at 100 mM KCl while incubating with IgG - Sepharose beads . The beads were then washed extensively with lysis buffer containing 100 mM KCl . The cell extracts and IgG precipitates were separated on 10 % SDS - PAGE gels for immunoblotting with anti - Dam1p antibodies or rabbit IgG , and on an 8 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gel for immunoblotting with anti - Ndc80p antibodies . Rabbit IgG was used to detect the ZZ domain of protein A present in the Dad1p and Spc24p tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation tags . C . Shang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3350 the dam1 ( S to D ) mutant exhibited a much decreased , but not completely abolished , interaction with Ndc80p is con - sistent with the observation that dam1 ( S to D ) mutant prey sometimes showed a detectable interaction with the NDC80 bait in the absence of 3 mM 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole ( our un - published data ) . This result also corresponds well with the fact the dam1 ( S to D ) mutant showed poor growth , rather than a lethal mutant phenotype ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) , suggesting that the kinetochore - microtubule connection is not completely disrupted . The constitutive phosphorylation of Dam1p results in weaker Dam1p – Ndc80p and Dam1p – Spc34p interactions and slower growth . We predict that this effect would be exacerbated by Ipl1p phosphorylation of Ndc80p and Spc34p , which have also been demonstrated to be Ipl1 tar - gets in vivo ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . Indeed , a severe synthetic growth defect is observed when dam1 ( S257D , S265D , S290D ) is combined with an ndc80 constitutive phos - phorylation mutant ( Kang and Chan , unpublished data ) . Moreover , we also found synthetic lethality between spc34 ( T199D ) and dam1 ( S257D , S265D , S292D ) mutants . To - gether , these data suggest that the physical interactions be - tween Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes , and the interactions between subunits of the Dam1 complex , are crucial for cell viability and that these interactions are regulated by the dynamic cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation . Phosphorylation Affects Dam1p Interaction with the Kinetochore In Vivo The in vivo consequence of Dam1p phosphorylation was previously demonstrated by a chromosome lagging pheno - type in the dam1 ( S20D S257D S265D ) mutant , which sug - gested a deﬁcient chromosome - microtubule attachment ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . We found that this chromosome lagging phenotype was even more dramatic in the dam1 ( S20D S257D S265D S292D ) mutant ( Figure 6A ) . Approxi - mately 20 % of the cells in an asynchronous culture showed this phenotype ( Figure 6C , left ) . To test whether the defects in the attachment are due to the weakened interaction be - tween the Dam1 complex with the dam1p ( S to D ) mutant and the Ndc80 complex , we conducted chromatin immuno - precipitation analysis , comparing the amount of Dam1 com - plex associated with the centromeres in the wild - type and the dam1 ( S20D S257D S265D S292D ) mutant ( Figure 6B ) . Strikingly , the amount of Dam1 complex associated with the centromeres in the dam1 ( S20D S257D S265D S292D ) mutant was reduced by 25 – 35 % compared with that in the wild type ( Figure 6 , B and C , anti - Duo1p and anti - Dam1p ) . In contrast , the amount of Ndc80p associated with the centromeres was unchanged in the wild type and the mutant ( Figure 6 , B and C , anti - Ndc80p ) . Together , these data strongly suggest that phosphorylation of the Dam1 complex weakens its interac - tion with the kinetochore , most likely through decreased binding between Dam1p and Ndc80p . DISCUSSION Mechanism of Phosphoregulation of the Yeast Kinetochore Previous studies have demonstrated that the Ipl1 kinase is a key regulator of the budding yeast kinetochore . Speciﬁcally , it facilitates the establishment of kinetochore biorientation by promoting turnover of kinetochore - microtubule connec - tions . It has been hypothesized that Ipl1p causes frequent detachment of kinetochores from microtubules in the ab - sence of tension ( Tanaka et al . , 2002 ) . Because the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes have been identiﬁed as in vivo targets of Ipl1p ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) and because the phosphor - ylation state of the Dam1 complex does not affect its micro - tubule binding activity , one possible mechanism of kineto - chore detachment would be to disrupt a subset of protein – protein interactions within the kinetochore , thereby leading to the detachment of kinetochores from spindle microtu - bules ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . Four lines of evidence sup - port the conclusion that the physical interactions between Dam1p and Ndc80p are weakened by Ipl1 kinase - mediated phosphorylation . First , we found the two - hybrid interaction between Dam1p and Ndc80p was greatly reduced or abol - ished when the dam1 ( S to D ) mutant ( which mimics the constitutively Ipl1p phosphorylated state ) was used as a prey in combination with the NDC80 bait . Second , we dem - onstrated that puriﬁed intact Ndc80 complex bound more tightly to wild - type Dam1p than to the dam1p ( S to D ) Figure 5 . Intact Ndc80 complex shows reduced binding to dam1p ( S to D ) . Intact Ndc80 complex immobilized on S - agarose beads bound similar amounts of in vitro translated wild - type Dam1p and dam1p ( S to A ) , but showed much weaker binding to dam1p ( S to D ) . Each binding reaction contained (cid:5) 3 nmol of Ndc80 complex on the beads puriﬁed from 16 g of yeast cells and was carried out in duplicate samples . The IVT Dam1 proteins did not bind to S - agarose beads alone . ( A ) Autoradiography shows the IVT Dam1 proteins in supernatant and bead fractions in each binding reaction .

( B ) Bar graph shows the percentage of IVT Dam1p bound to Ndc80 com - plex - associated beads . Dam1p Complex Vol . 14 , August 2003 3351 mutant . Third , the dam1 ( S to D ) mutant shows a severe synthetic growth defect in combination with an ndc80 ( S to D ) mutant ( Kang and Chan , unpublished data ) . And ﬁnally , mutant dam1p ( S to D ) showed reduced association with the centromeres that corresponds well with the chromosome lagging phenotype , whereas the Ndc80p - centromere associ - ation remained unchanged . Although the possibility exists that the differential in - teraction was due to conformational changes induced in Dam1p by multiple phosphorylation site mutations , three factors lead us to conclude that this is not the case . First , we found that the amount of IVT Ndc80p that bound to GST - Dam1p was also reduced by the addition of Ipl1p ( our unpublished data ) . Second , the two - hybrid and the in vitro binding assays demonstrated that the differential physical interactions of the dam1p mutant were observed only with speciﬁc partners ( i . e . , Ndc80p and Spc34p , but not Duo1p ) . Third , the phosphorylation site mutants cause very speciﬁc chromosome segregation defects , in contrast to other loss of function dam1 alleles , which show both aberrant spindle structures and chromosome misseg - regation phenotypes ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001b , 2002a ) . This Figure 6 . The dam1p ( S to D ) mutant shows reduced interaction with centromeres . ( A ) The chromosome lag - ging phenotype of dam1 ( S20D S257D S262D S292D ) mu - tant was quantiﬁed . Wild - type and mutant cells were grown to log phase at 25°C and processed for tubulin immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and DNA staining . Cells ( 200 ) were counted for each strain . The result is shown in ( C , left bar graph ) . ( B ) Association of the Dam1 complex with centromeres in wild - type and dam1 ( S20D S257D S262D S292D ) mutant cells was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis . Centromeres from chromo - some 3 and chromosome 8 were ampliﬁed by PCR from total input chromatin ( input ) , mock - treated no antibody controls ( no antibody ) , and duplicated Duo1p , Dam1p , and Ndc80p immunoprecipitates ( only one Ndc80p sam - ple is shown herein ) . The PCR products were quantiﬁed . The values underneath the gel lanes correspond to the percentage of total centromeric DNA that is immunopre - cipitated with the indicated antibody . The values are the average from duplicate samples . ( C , right bar graph ) Com - parison of centromeric DNA immunoprecipitated in wild - type and dam1 ( S20D S257D S265D S292D ) mutant . The amount of centromeric DNA immunoprecipitated from the mutant is expressed as the percentage of that from the wild - type . C . Shang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3352 suggests that the dam1 phosphorylation sites mutants are functional for a subset of Dam1p activities . Therefore , the data presented above strongly support our hypothesis that phosphorylation of essential kinetochore compo - nents , such as the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes , weakens their physical interactions and therefore results in the detachment of the kinetochore from the microtubule ( Fig - ure 7 ) . Our previous published work showed that dam1 S to D mutants partially suppress the ipl1 - 2 temperature sensitivity and kinetochore structure defects ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . These results supported our conclusion that Dam1p is a bona ﬁde downstream target of the Ipl1 kinase . Our current model cannot fully account for how dam1 constitutive phos - phorylation mutations suppress the ipl1 - 2 kinetochore as - sembly defect , because we postulate herein that phosphor - ylation weakens kinetochore subunit interactions . Here is a possible scenario . The loading of kinetochore proteins at centromeres is partially dependent on microtubule interac - tions ( Enquist - Newman et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) . Further - more , establishing new spindle interactions requires break - ing old interactions , and this is mediated by Ipl1 kinase phosphorylation of the Dam1 complex . Therefore , Ipl1p phosphorylation may in some cases promote kinetochore assembly by facilitating formation of new kinetochore at - tachments . An additional mechanism by which the Ipl1p kinase may affect the yeast kinetochore might be through regulation of the assembly of the Dam1 complex . The Dam1p – Spc34p interaction was weakened by Ipl1p - speciﬁc phosphorylation in both the two - hybrid screen and the in vitro binding assay . In addition , the growth defect caused by constitutive Dam1p phosphorylation is aggravated by constitutive Spc34p phos - phorylation , as seen by the synthetic lethality between dam1 ( S257D , S265D , S292D ) and spc34 ( T199D ) mutants . Because the subunit composition of puriﬁed Dam1 complex is unaf - fected by the phosphorylation state ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ) , it is possible that the assembly of the entire Dam1 complex is compromised . Alternatively , the weakened Dam1p – Spc34p interaction might result in conformational change in the Dam1 complex that in turn affects the inter - action between the Dam1 complex and other kinetochore components . Dam1p Interactions Identiﬁed in Both In Vitro Binding and Two - Hybrid Assays To elucidate the protein – protein interactions that underlie the mechanism of chromosome - microtubule attachment at the yeast kinetochore , we constructed a protein interaction map focusing on the microtubule - binding Dam1 kineto - chore complex . By two complementary approaches , two - hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays , we identiﬁed interactions among the subunits of the Dam1 complex , and interactions between the Dam1 complex and other kineto - chore or spindle components . We also demonstrated the association of the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes in yeast extracts . Six interacting partners for Dam1p were common to both assays : Duo1p , Dam1p , Spc34p , Ndc80p , Sli15p , and Bim1p ( Figure 2B , highlighted in red ) . As discussed above , the Ndc80p – Dam1p and the Spc34p – Dam1p interactions seem to be regulated by phosphorylation . Duo1p represents an internal positive control for all of the assay conditions be - cause its interaction with Dam1p has been well - documented using both in vitro and two - hybrid assays ( Hofmann et al . , 1998 ; Ito et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Uetz et al . , 2000 ) . Because the Dam1 complex was shown to contain a single copy of each subunit ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ) , the self - interaction of Dam1p raises the possibility that this complex dimerizes . Whether dimerization might be important for the role of the Dam1 complex at the spindle , the kinetochore , or both , remains to be determined . Other Dam1p binding partners include the Sli15p subunit of the Ipl1 complex and Bim1p , a microtubule - associated protein . The Dam1p – Sli15p interac - tion may play an important role in targeting the Ipl1 kinase to the Dam1 complex . Because Bim1p has been implicated in kinetochore function based on its genetic interactions ( Tong et al . , 2001 ) , it will be important to determine whether its interaction with Dam1p occurs at the kinetochore , along the spindle , or at both locations . In Vitro Binding Assays Identiﬁed Novel Partners of the Dam1 Complex Many subunits of the Ctf19 and CBF3 complexes , as well as other kinetochore proteins , did not show positive interac - tions in any of the high - throughput two - hybrid screens , or in our two - hybrid screens ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . This lack of two - hybrid interactions might represent the false negatives in these screens , resulting from the lack of expres - sion of fusion proteins in the array , or a lack of functionality for the fusion proteins ( Drees et al . , 2001 ) . We therefore tested for direct physical associations involving these pro - teins and included (cid:1) 90 % ( 41 proteins ) of the known kinet - ochore components in our Dam1p - binding assays . Surpris - ingly , we found that the inner kinetochore ( DNA - binding ) proteins Ndc10p , Ctf13p , Cep3 , and Cse4p interact with Dam1p in vitro ( Figure 2B ) . The Dam1 complex is thought to function at the outer kinetochore based on its ability to bind to microtubules and based on its lack of two - hybrid inter - actions with the inner kinetochore proteins . To rule out the possibility that the binding occurred because Dam1p did not exist in its native complex , we demonstrated that intact Dam1 complex also interacted with Ndc10p , Ctf13p , and Cse4p . In light of these binding results , it is possible that the Dam1 complex associates with the CBF3 complex directly in Figure 7 . A model for phosphoregulation at the yeast kinetochore . Interactions between the Dam1 complex and the Ndc80 complex are proposed to be weakened when Dam1p and Ndc80p are phosphor - ylated by Ipl1p , facilitating formation of bipolar connections be - tween chromosomes and the spindle . Dam1p Complex Vol . 14 , August 2003 3353 vivo . This association might occur at the kinetochore to stabilize the linkage between the inner and outer kineto - chore in parallel with the Ctf19 complex , or along the an - aphase spindle , or at the spindle midzone , where Ndc10p and the Dam1 complex have been observed ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2002 ; Buvelot et al . , 2003 ) . Undoubtedly , much more work is needed before we fully understand how the kinetochore is assembled and regu - lated . The binding assays also identiﬁed interactions between the Dam1 complex and several checkpoint proteins , such as Mps1p , Mad1p , Mad3p , Bub1p , and Bub2p . These check - point proteins ( except Bub2p ) are thought to be recruited to the kinetochore upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint . However , only one two - hybrid interaction , Mad1p - Spc25p ( Newman et al . , 2000 ) , has previously been found between checkpoint and kinetochore proteins ( see Supplementary Table 3 ) . Herein , we presented evidence for additional potential links for the targeting of checkpoint proteins to the kinetochore . Further investigation is required to determine whether or how these interactions might con - tribute to the checkpoint signaling . In conclusion , numerous protein – protein interactions at the kinetochore have been identiﬁed in our systematic study . It is now important to test their individual contribu - tions to kinetochore function and to determine whether these interactions are spatially and / or temporally regulated .
