Cytoplasmic transport of ﬂuorophore - tagged Ad2 and immuno - logically detected HSV - 1 capsids required intact microtubules and the microtubule - dependent minus - end - directed motor complex dynein - dynactin . A recent study with epithelial cells suggested that Ad5 was trans - ported to the nucleus and expressed its genes independently of a microtubule network . To clarify the mechanisms by which Ad2 and , as an independent control , HSV - 1 were targeted to the nucleus , we treated epithelial cells with nocodazole ( NOC ) to depolymerize microtubules and measured viral gene expression at different times and multiplicities of infections . Our results indicate that in NOC - treated cells , viral transgene expression was signiﬁcantly reduced at up to 48 h postinfection ( p . i . ) . A quantitative analysis of subcellular capsid localization indicated that NOC blocked the nuclear targeting of Ad2 and also HSV - 1 by more than 90 % at up to 7 h p . i . About 10 % of the incoming Texas Red - coupled Ad2 ( Ad2 - TR ) was enriched at the nucleus in microtubule - depleted cells at 5 h p . i . This result is consistent with earlier observations that Ad2 - TR capsids move randomly in NOC - treated cells at less than 0 . 1 (cid:1) m / s and over distances of less than 5 (cid:1) m , characteristic of Brownian motion . We conclude that ﬂuorophore - tagged Ad2 and HSV - 1 particles are infectious and that microtubules play a prominent role in efﬁcient nuclear targeting during entry and gene expression of species C Ads and HSV - 1 . Many viruses , including adenoviruses ( Ads ) and herpesvi - ruses , spread by intracellular transport within infected host cells , thus increasing the viral load in target organs and possibly causing severe disease ( 44 ) . The 51 human Ad serotypes— classiﬁed into six species ( A to F ) —have distinct tropisms ( 19 ) . For example , Ad type 2 ( Ad2 ) and Ad5 ( species C ) and Ad3 ( species B ) are associated with upper - airway infections . Other serotypes are linked to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( species D ) , pneumonia ( species E ) , enteric infections ( species A and F ) , or infections of hematopoietic cells ( 41 ) . The Herpesviridae family consists of the alpha - , beta - and gammaherpesviruses . Like Ads , alphaherpesviruses , including herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) , infect different cell types both in cultures and in their hosts . After infection of mucosal or damaged cutane - ous epithelium , these neurotropic viruses establish latent in - fections , primarily in sensory ganglia , that , upon reactivation , lead to recurrent epidermal lesions ( 40 , 55 ) . The ability to infect a broad range of postmitotic cells has made both Ads and herpesviruses useful gene delivery vehicles ( 21 ) that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials ( 29 , 39 ) . For their application as therapeutic vectors and to identify new potential targets for antiviral therapy , it is crucial to understand how the genomes are targeted to the nucleus . The entry mechanisms for Ads and herpesviruses have been well studied . Ads are internalized by receptor - mediated endo - cytosis that is dependent on F actin and leave the endosomal pathway at various sites ( recently reviewed in reference 11 ) . The species C Ads , including Ad2 and Ad5 , exit from a slightly acidic compartment of pH 6 at about 10 min postentry ( 16 , 42 ) , whereas Ad7 ( species B ) has been reported to escape from acidic late endosomes and lysosomes ( 32 ) . In contrast , HSV - 1 delivers its capsids into the cytosol upon fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane ( 45 , 46 ) . Both viruses then target their capsids to the cell nucleus , uncoat , and inject the enclosed linear double - stranded DNA genomes through the nuclear pores into the nucleoplasm for replication ( 14 , 35 , 53 ) . A number of electron microscopy studies have shown that cytoplasmic capsids of both species C Ads and alphaherpesvi - ruses can associate with microtubules ( MTs ) ( 5 , 10 , 27 , 28 , 31 , 37 , 45 , 47 , 57 ) . Moreover , time - lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy experiments of ﬂuorophore - tagged Ads have demonstrated that Ads move along linear tracks of MTs ( 25 , 26 , 49 ) . The motility of incoming particles is bidirectional , toward and away from the nucleus , but the overall motilities are toward the minus ends of MTs and require the major minus - end - directed motor dynein and the cofactor dynactin . If MTs are depoly - merized with nocodazole ( NOC ) , then the long - range linear motilities cease , the remaining short - range transport has no directional control and , most importantly , the efﬁciency of Ad2 DNA delivery is strongly reduced , as indicated by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization assays ( 48 , 49 ) . Similar results have been reported for alphaherpesviruses . * Corresponding author .

Moreover , incoming HSV - 1 capsids colocalize with dynein and dynactin , and trans - port to the nucleus is reduced by the dynein inhibitors erythro - 9 [ 3 - ( 2 - hydroxynonyl ) ] adenine and dynamitin ( 6a , 22 , 45 ) . Ax - onal herpesvirus transport occurs at rates of 0 . 5 to 3 . 5 (cid:2) m / s , with peak velocities of up to 5 (cid:2) m / s ( 1 , 28 , 37 , 43 ) ; viral structures are transported bidirectionally along linear tracks with high processivity over distances of up to 20 (cid:2) m , as dem - onstrated by video microscopy with green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged mutants ( 1 , 43 ; A . Wolfstein et al . , unpublished data ) . In a recent article , it was proposed that Ad5 infections do not require MTs ( 8 ) . We therefore decided to conduct a quan - titative analysis of Ad5 - mediated gene expression and Texas Red ( TR ) - coupled Ad2 ( Ad2 - TR ) subcellular localization in cells depleted of MTs ; as an independent control , we included HSV - 1 . Our results show that the large majority of Ad2 - TR , Ad5 , and HSV - 1 particles utilize intact MTs to reach the nu - cleus in order to infect nonpolarized epithelial cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and reagents . Immortalized human adenocarcinoma - derived alveolar epithelial A549 cells ( ATCC CCL - 185 ) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( Gibco Invitrogen , Basel , Switzerland ) containing 7 % Clone III serum ( HyClone ; Socochim , Geneva , Switzerland ) and 1 % nonessential amino acids , 2 mM glutamine , 100 U of penicillin / ml , and 0 . 1 mg of streptomycin / ml ( all from Gibco - BRL ) . PtK 2 cells ( ATCC CCL - 56 ) and BHK - 21 cells ( ATCC CCL - 10 ) were grown in 10 % and Vero cells ( ATCC CCL - 81 ) were grown in 7 . 5 % fetal calf serum containing minimal essential medium , 2 mM glutamine , nonessential amino acids and , for Vero cells , 100 U of penicillin / ml and 100 (cid:2) g of strepto - mycin / ml . All cell lines were cultured in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 – air atmosphere . NOC ( Sigma ) and paclitaxel ( Calbiochem - Novabiochem or Sigma ) were dis - solved as 1 , 000 - fold stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and used as indicated below . For the immunoﬂuorescence experiments , we used preadsorbed rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against DNA - containing capsids ( anti - heavy chain [ HC ] ) or empty capsids ( anti - light chain [ LC ] ) to detect incoming viral capsids ( 4 , 45 ) . MTs were labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against (cid:3) - tubulin ( N357 ; Amersham , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) ( 2 ) . Ad infection and gene expression . Ad2 was puriﬁed and coupled to TR as described previously to yield Ad2 - TR ( 33 ) . This virus was as infectious as the nonlabeled parent virus , as determined by plaque assays with A549 cells . The Ad5 derivative AE18 , lacking the E1 and E3 regions , expressed lacZ from the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) major promoter ( provided by E . Vigne , Institut G . Roussy , Villejuif , France ) ( 54 ) . Luc - Ad5 , lacking E1 and E3 , expressed luciferase from a CMV promoter inserted into the E1 region ( kindly provided by S . Hemmi and D . Serena , University of Zu¨rich ) . In brief , this virus was constructed from a pPoly plasmid backbone ( 3 ) and plasmid pTG - H5 DL324 ( kindly supplied by S . Rusconi , University of Fribourg , Fribourg , Switzerland ) . Cells were seeded in 24 - well dishes ( Costar ; Integra Biosciences ) or on glass coverslips 1 to 2 days before the experiment . Prior to infection , 60 to 90 % conﬂuent cells were exposed to NOC in DMSO or just DMSO alone in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium for 1 h and then were infected with AE18 at 100 to 10 , 000 physical particles per cell at 37°C . At various times after the addition of the virus , cells were either analyzed for their viability or lysed , and lysates were assayed for (cid:3) - galactosidase ( (cid:3) - Gal ) activity and protein content . (cid:3) - Gal activity was measured by a (cid:3) - Gal enzyme assay ( Promega Corporation ) . The cells in 1 well of a 24 - well dish were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) at 7 , 24 , 32 , or 48 h postinfection ( p . i . ) and lysed in 400 (cid:2) l of reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) for 15 min at room temperature under slowly rocking conditions . The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4°C for 2 min , and 30 (cid:2) l of the supernatants was mixed with the same volume of 2 (cid:4) enzyme reaction buffer ( Promega ) and incubated at 37°C for various times . The reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 (cid:2) l of 1 M sodium carbonate . The absorbance was read at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer ( MRX microplate reader ; Dynatech Laboratories ; BioLogics , Gainesville , Va ) . The background activity of noninfected A549 cells was subtracted from the measurements . The protein content of each lysate was measured with Micro BCA protein assay reagent ( Pierce ) , and the results are expressed as enzymatic units per milligram of protein per minute . The luciferase activity of infected cells was determined with cell lysates at 7 h p . i . by using a commercial assay system ( Promega ) . The cells in 1 well of a 24 - well dish were washed with PBS and lysed in 400 (cid:2) l of reporter lysis buffer . The centrifuged lysates ( 20 (cid:2) l ) were placed in an opaque 96 - well plate for luciferase activity measurements with a Multilabel Counter ( Wallac Victor 2 1420 ; Perkin - Elmer ) , which injected 50 (cid:2) l of luciferase assay reagent into each well . HSV - 1 infection and gene expression . Wild - type HSV - 1 strain F ( ATCC VR - 733 ) and mutant strain [ KOS ] tk12 were ampliﬁed and puriﬁed as described previously ( 45 ) . Immediate - early viral gene expression was analyzed by using mutant [ KOS ] tk12 , which lacks the viral thymidine kinase gene and encodes the enzyme (cid:3) - Gal under the control of the immediate - early ICP4 promoter of HSV - 1 ( kindly provided by P . Spear , Northwestern University , Chicago , Ill . ) ( 56 ) . PtK 2 cells were cultured in 24 - well plates at a density of 4 (cid:4) 10 4 to 5 (cid:4) 10 4 cells per well for 1 day . They were pretreated with NOC or paclitaxel in DMSO or just DMSO alone for 1 h , cooled to 4°C , and incubated with virus for 2 h as described elsewhere ( 6a , 45 ) . Unbound virus was removed by repeated washing in PBS , and the cells were further incubated in culture medium at 37°C . At different times , the cells were lysed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) in PBS containing 1 mg of bovine serum albumin / ml and protease inhibitors at 37°C for 15 min . Lysates were then incubated with 3 . 5 mg of o - nitrophenyl - (cid:3) - D - galactopyranoside / ml in 73 mM Na 2 HPO 4 – 16 mM NaH 2 PO 4 – 0 . 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 – 0 . 4 mM KCl – 17 mM NaCl . The enzymatic activity of (cid:3) - Gal was measured after about 2 h at 420 nm by using a plate reader ( Spectra Count microplate photom - eter ; Packard Instrument Company , Meriden , Conn . ) . On a parallel plate , cells were ﬁxed with 3 % ( wt / vol ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 20 min , washed with water , and then stained with 0 . 25 mg of crystal violet / ml in 5 % ethanol for 10 min to quantify the amount of cells present after different treatments . After several washes in water , the plates were dried , and the bound crystal violet was dissolved in 100 % ethanol and quantiﬁed by measuring the optical density at 590 nm ( 17 ) . Crystal violet staining gave a linear signal over cell concentrations ranging from at least 3 (cid:4) 10 3 to 3 (cid:4) 10 5 cells per well ( data not shown ) . Quantiﬁcation of subcellular viral targeting . To analyze the subcellular dis - tribution of incoming HSV - 1 capsids , Vero or PtK 2 cells were infected in the presence of 0 . 5 mM cycloheximide . The cells were then ( i ) ﬁxed with 100 % methanol for 4 min at (cid:5) 20°C after a 10 - s preextraction in 0 . 5 % TX - 100 – 80 mM PIPES - KOH ( pH 6 . 8 ) – 2 mM MgSO 4 – 10 (cid:2) M paclitaxel to visualize MTs and capsids as described previously ( 45 ) , ( ii ) ﬁxed and permeabilized simultaneously with PHEMO - ﬁx ( 3 . 7 % [ wt / vol ] PFA , 0 . 05 % [ wt / vol ] glutaraldehyde , and 0 . 5 % TX - 100 in PHEMO - buffer [ see below ] ) for 10 min and washed with PHEMO - buffer ( 68 mM PIPES - KOH [ pH 6 . 9 ] , 15 mM EGTA , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % DMSO ) to label MTs , or ( iii ) ﬁxed with 3 % ( wt / vol ) PFA in PBS for 20 min and then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) TX - 100 for exactly 5 min . The remaining PFA was inactivated by incubating the cells with 50 mM NH 4 Cl – PBS for 10 min . Immunolabeling was performed as described elsewhere ( 6a , 45 ) . The cells were examined either with a modiﬁed confocal microscope ( model MRC600 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , Calif . ) attached to an Axiovert microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , N . Y . ) with separate ﬁlters for each ﬂuorochrome or with a Leica SP1 microscope ( (cid:4) 63 oil - immersion objective ; numeric aperature , 1 . 32 ) with UV excitation at 351 and 364 nm and with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( 468 nm ) , TR ( 568 nm ) , and long - pass emission ﬁlters in sequential recording mode at a section thickness of 0 . 5 (cid:2) m . Images were processed with Photoshop 5 . 0 ( Adobe ) . The subcellular distributions of Ad2 - TR and HSV - 1 ( immunolabeled with an anti - LC antibody ) were determined by quantitative ﬂuorescence micros - copy of cells ﬁxed with PHEMO - ﬁx by the procedure described earlier ( 33 ) . Cell viability assay . Cell viability was assessed with a live / dead viability / cyto - toxicity two - color ﬂuorescence assay ( L - 3224 ; Molecular Probes ) . This assay measures intracellular esterase activity with the cell - permeable substrate Cal - cein - AM , which is converted by live cells to the ﬂuorescent polyanion calcein ( excitation , 495 nm ; emission , 515 nm ) , which is retained in living cells by the intact plasma membrane . In addition , we used the non - cell - permeating DNA dye ethidium homodimer - 1 ( EthD - 1 ) ( excitation , 495 nm ; emission , 635 nm ) , which is detected in cells with compromised membranes , i . e . , dead cells . In this assay , live cells have a green ﬂuorescent cytoplasm but no EthD - 1 signal , whereas dead cells lack green ﬂuorescence and are stained with EthD - 1 . The assays were performed by washing cells once with PBS and incubating them with Calcein - AM ( 0 . 8 (cid:2) M for A549 cells and 0 . 2 (cid:2) M for PtK 2 cells ) and EthD - 1 ( 0 . 8 (cid:2) M for A549 cells and 0 . 1 (cid:2) M for PtK 2 cells ) in Hanks’ medium ( Gibco - BRL ) at 37°C for 15 min . Cells were washed with Hanks’ medium , and ﬂuorescence was analyzed with a Leica inverted ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a (cid:4) 63 oil - immersion objective ( numeric aperture , 1 . 32 ) , a band - pass excitation ﬁlter , and a double - pass emission ﬁlter as described earlier ( 49 ) .

RESULTS Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) recently suggested that Ad5 infection of the epithelial cell line A549 occurred in the absence of MTs ( 8 ) , contradicting earlier results ( 26 , 49 ) . A reexamination of the role of MTs in Ad infection was therefore warranted . NOC is an inhibitor of Ad5 infection . We ﬁrst analyzed adenovirus transgene expression in A549 cells containing in - tact or disrupted MTs . Cells were preincubated with different concentrations of the MT - depolymerizing agent NOC at 37°C for 60 min ( 20 ) and then were inoculated with (cid:3) - Gal - express - ing Ad5 ( (cid:3) - Gal – Ad5 ) at 10 , 000 physical particles per cell , equivalent to about 300 associated particles per cell ( 48 ) . The particle - to - PFU ratio is estimated to be on the order of 20 to 100 , corresponding to 3 to 15 bound infectious particles per cell ( 18 ) . (cid:3) - Gal activity was measured in cell lysates at 7 h p . i . , the earliest time point that gave a reliable reading . The lowest concentration of NOC ( 0 . 2 (cid:2) M ) had no effect on (cid:3) - Gal ex - pression , whereas 2 (cid:2) M NOC resulted in 40 % inhibition and 20 (cid:2) M NOC resulted in greater than 80 % inhibition compared to the results obtained for untreated cells ( Fig . 1A ) . The latter conditions are sufﬁcient to completely depolymerize MTs in Vero cells ( 45 ) ( Fig . 4A , panel d ) , HeLa cells ( 49 ) , or A549 cells ( Fig . 2A , panel e ) , whereas PtK 2 cells require 50 (cid:2) M NOC ( data not shown ) . A549 cells were therefore treated with 20 (cid:2) M NOC , and (cid:3) - Gal activity was measured at 7 , 24 , and 48 h after inoculation with 1 , 000 and 10 , 000 particles per cell . In both instances , there was a severe reduction of gene expres - sion , with 85 % inhibition at 7 h p . i . and 50 to 70 % inhibition at 24 and 48 h p . i . ( Fig . 1B ) . The effect of NOC was reversible , as indicated by washing the cells with drug - free medium at 180 min p . i . and incubating them for anothe r 4 h in theabsence of drug ( Fig . 1C ) . When NOC was added at 3 h p . i . , when a large fraction of the incoming DNA had been delivered to the nu - cleoplasm ( 49 , 53 ) , there was only marginal inhibition of viral gene expression . This result indicated that most of the infec - tious particles had reached the nucleus at 3 h p . i . In contrast , when NOC was present throughout the infection , (cid:3) - Gal ex - pression was reduced by 85 % compared to that in control cells . We next tested the effect of NOC on the gene expression of a different virus , Luc - Ad5 . This strategy enabled us to reduce the viral load to 10 particles per cell and still measure trans - gene activity as early as 7 h p . i . Consistent with the (cid:3) - Gal activity results , 20 (cid:2) M NOC reduced luciferase activity by 50 to 70 % at 10 , 100 , 1 , 000 , or 10 , 000 particles per cell ( Fig . 1D ) . Importantly , the assay was linear in this range . We next ana - lyzed whether NOC affected the viability of the cells either in the presence or in the absence of (cid:3) - Gal – Ad5 . Cells were pre - treated with NOC ( 20 (cid:2) M ) for 1 h , infected or not infected with Ad5 , and then stained with the vital dyes Calcein - AM and EthD - 1 . Intact live cells excluded EthD - 1 and cytosolic ester - ases hydrolyzed Calcein - AM , thus generating green ﬂuores - cent Calcein . All cells on the coverslip were EthD - 1 negative and Calcein positive ( Fig . 1E , panels a to f ) , unlike cells that had been treated with methanol ( Fig . 1E , panels g to i ) . Im - portantly , there was no cell loss from the coverslips , as veriﬁed by differential interference contrast imaging ( Fig . 1E , panels c , f , and i ) . NOC blocks the nuclear accumulation of Ad2 - TR . If NOC is an early inhibitor of Ad5 infection , then it could have an effect on genome trafﬁcking . To visualize cytoplasmic particles , we used ﬂuorescent Ad2 - TR containing two to four TR molecules per hexon trimer , corresponding to 200 to 400 TR molecules per virion ( 13 , 33 ) . Importantly , this virus is as infectious as unlabeled virus and is not aggregated , as judged by electron microscopy of negatively stained particles and population anal - ysis of viral ﬂuorescence ( 33 ) . A recent study showed that the DNA genome of puriﬁed Ad2 separates from the capsid at the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) and that the remainder of the capsid tends to form aggregates or becomes undetectable ( 53 ) . A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of NOC as described above , and Ad2 - TR was bound to the cell surface at 4°C for 1 h tosynchronize the infection at 37°C in the presence or in the absence of the drug . One set of cells was ﬁxed at 75 min p . i . and stained for MTs . Clearly , increasing amounts of NOC progressively depolymerized MTs ( Fig . 2A ) , whereas DMSO alone had no effect on the morphology of the MT network . By use of a fast Fourier transformation algo - rithm , viral ﬂuorescence was quantitated in the cell periphery , the cytoplasmic area , and the nucleus , including a perinuclear region of 1 . 5 (cid:2) m ( 33 ) . While control cells had low peripheral and cytoplasmic but high nuclear ﬂuorescence signals ( less than 1 but more than 5 ﬂuorescence units per unit area , respectively ) , 20 (cid:2) M NOC - treated cells showed almost no nuclear accumulation of Ad2 - TR ( 1 . 6 ﬂuorescence units per unit area ) ; instead , there was a signiﬁcant increase in the pe - ripheral and cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence intensity ( P (cid:6) 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . We next carried out a time course experiment either in the absence or in the presence of 20 (cid:2) M NOC . As expected , the nuclear and perinuclear ﬂuorescence of control cells increased to greater than 5 ﬂuorescence units per unit area at 75 min p . i . compared to 1 unit at 0 min p . i . , while the peripheral and cytoplasmic Ad2 - TR ﬂuorescence decreased to less than 0 . 2 unit ( Fig . 2C ) . At 150 min , however , the viral capsid load in the nuclear and perinuclear area decreased to less than two , in - dicative of viral disassembly , which peaks at between 150 and 180 min p . i . ( 14 , 53 ) . The strong decrease in nuclear Ad2 - TR particles coincided with a robust increase in peripheral and cytoplasmic virus , suggesting that viral capsids or fragments were transported back to the periphery . Interestingly , the nu - clear ﬂuorescence increased again at 300 and 420 min p . i . ( P (cid:7) 0 . 05 ) and the peripheral ﬂuorescence decreased . These results suggested a second transport wave of Ad2 - TR toward the nucleus . This experiment conﬁrms that in control cells , our measurements of ﬂuorescent capsids are quantitative at least until 75 min p . i . , the onset of capsid disassembly . The subcellular virus distribution in NOC - treated cells was fundamentally different from that in control cells . At up to 150 min p . i . , the viral capsid load in the nuclear and perinuclear region was no different from the charge at 0 min p . i . ; i . e . , there was no enrichment of Ad2 - TR near the nucleus ( Fig . 2D ) . The virus concentrations in the cytoplasm and the periphery were slightly reduced . Interestingly , we found a small but signiﬁcant accumulation of Ad2 - TR near the nucleus ( P (cid:6) 0 . 01 ) at 300 min p . i .

At least some nuclear capsids must have been genome - containing particles , since we detected viral gene expression in the presence of NOC . The reduction in the nuclear capsid signal at 420 min p . i . might have been due to capsid disassembly . In summary , these results indicate that more than 90 % of the incoming Ad2 - TR did not reach the nucleus in the absence of MTs and that this transport block strongly reduced viral gene expression .

MTs are a major intracellular trafﬁcking route of alphaherpesviruses . We therefore tested the effect of NOC on HSV - 1 gene delivery using the expression of (cid:3) - Gal activity controlled by the viral immediate - early promoter of ICP4 . PtK 2 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of NOC , incubated with HSV - 1 [ KOS ] tk12 in the cold , infected in the presence or in the absence of drug at 37°C for 4 h , and analyzed for (cid:3) - Gal activity . The results clearly indicate that NOC is a dose - dependent inhibitor of HSV - 1 infection ( Fig . 3A ) . The maximal inhibition of approximately 90 % was obtained with 25 (cid:2) M NOC . This effect was due neither to cell loss , as indicated by cell quanti - ﬁcation with crystal violet , nor to cell death , as measured by the live / dead assay ( data not shown ) . We next analyzed the effect of 25 (cid:2) M NOC on HSV - 1 infection in a time course experi - ment at multiplicities of infection ( MOIs ) of 2 and 10 from 3 to 7 h p . i . Under all conditions , NOC inhibited viral gene expres - sion in the range of 80 to 90 % ( Fig . 3B ) . However , the inhi - bition was not complete . At an MOI of 10 , there was a modest increase in gene expression from 3 to 7 h p . i . , indicating that a small fraction of infectious virus had reached the nucleus in - dependently of MTs . NOC inhibits nuclear targeting of incoming HSV - 1 . We next tested to what extent NOC affected MTs . Vero cells were preincubated with different concentrations of NOC for 1 h , incubated in the cold with HSV - 1 , and warmed in the presence or in the absence of drug for 2 h . The highest concentration of NOC ( 20 (cid:2) M ) completely depolymerized MTs and led to a random cytoplasmic localization of HSV - 1 capsids ( Fig . 4A , panel d ) . In the absence of drug , however , the MT network was intact and incoming HSV - 1 localized predominantly to the nucleus ( Fig . 4A , panel a ) . Intermediate concentrations of NOC ( 0 . 4 and 2 (cid:2) M ) had partial effects on MTs and HSV - 1 nuclear targeting ( Fig . 4A , panels b and c ) . To assess the effect of NOC on the subcellular trafﬁcking of HSV - 1 , we quantitated viral capsid ﬂuorescence in the periph - ery , the cytoplasm , and the nuclear and perinuclear region by using the same method as that used for Ad2 - TR . In the ab - sence of drug , there was a strong enrichment of HSV - 1 near the nucleus and a signiﬁcant decrease in the peripheral and cytoplasmic viral load at 120 and 180 min p . i . ( P (cid:6) 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 4B ) . NOC , however , blocked the nuclear accumulation as well as the cytoplasmic reduction of HSV - 1 at 120 and 180 min p . i . , compared to the results obtained at 30 min p . i . , but did not affect the reduction of virus in the periphery ( Fig . 4C ) . These results suggested that viral trafﬁcking through the cortex was independent of MTs , unlike further cytoplasmic transport , which largely required intact MTs . This conclusion was further supported by experiments with the MT - stabilizing drug pacli - taxel ( 10 (cid:2) M ) , which allowed a strong enrichment of HSV - 1 near the nucleus , although this enrichment was slightly less pronounced than that in drug - free cells . Accordingly , paclitaxel had only minimal effects on the expression of (cid:3) - Gal ( average inhibition , 20 to 30 % ) . Signiﬁcantly , paclitaxel did not inhibit the transport of virus through the cell periphery ( Fig . 4D ) . We conclude that HSV - 1 capsid transport occurs on stabilized MTs , suggesting that it does not depend on MT treadmilling or dynamic instability . DISCUSSION Using quantitative subcellular localization of incoming viral capsids and quantiﬁcation of viral gene expression in the ab - sence or in the presence of NOC , an MT - depolymerizing agent , we found that MTs play a crucial role in delivering Ad and HSV - 1 genomes to the nuclei of epithelial cells . The NOC inhibition was reversible ( 45 , 49 ; this study ) , NOC had no effect on cellular gene expression ( data not shown ) , and only minor FIG . 3 . Intact MTs are required for HSV - 1 mediated gene expres - sion . ( A ) PtK 2 cells were treated with DMSO ( control ) or NOC for 1 h at 37°C and then incubated with the (cid:3) - Gal - expressing HSV - 1 strain [ KOS ] tk12 at 4°C for 2 h ( MOI , 10 ) . The unbound viruses were re - moved , and the cells were shifted to 37°C in the presence or in the absence of NOC to initiate infection . Cells were lysed at 4 h p . i . , and the amount of (cid:3) - Gal was quantitated ( squares ) . Cells on parallel dishes were quantiﬁed by using the binding of crystal violet ( circles ) . The means and standard deviations for duplicate samples are shown . Note that with increasing NOC concentrations , the amount of imme - diate - early viral gene expression was inhibited . ( B ) Time course of HSV - 1 gene expression . Cells were infected in the absence ( ﬁlled symbols ) or in the presence ( open symbols ) of MTs with HSV - 1 [ KOS ] tk12 ( MOI of 2 [ triangles ] or MOI of 10 [ squares ] ) , lysed at different times p . i . , and analyzed for (cid:3) - Gal expression ( absorbance at 420 nm ) . At both MOIs and at all times tested , NOC clearly reduced immediate - early viral gene expression . The crystal violet assay showed no signiﬁcant loss of cells under these conditions ( (cid:6) 5 % ) ( data not shown ) .

NOC inhibits the nuclear targeting of HSV - 1 in Vero and PtK 2 cells . ( A ) Vero cells were infected in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of NOC with 50 PFU of HSV - 1 per cell for 2 h and then ﬁxed in methanol after preextraction . Samples were stained with anti - HC ( green ) and antitubulin ( red ) and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . Note the disappearance of the MTs with increasing concentrations of NOC and the lack of nuclear HSV - 1 capsids .

Cells were ﬁxed at 30 , 120 , or 180 min p . i . and labeled with anti - LC . n , number of cells . Error bars indicate standard errors of the means . MTs in Vero cells were completely depolymerized at lower concentrations of NOC than were those in PtK 2 cells ( data not shown ) . 9968 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 b y PE NN S T A T E UN I V h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m effects on viral gene expression after particle transport to the nucleus had occurred ( this study ) . We therefore concluded , as others have before , that NOC is not a general inhibitor of transcription or translation but acts predominantly on the MT network ( 20 ) . MTs are required for viral capsid transport . There are sev - eral explanations for why NOC treatment did not completely inhibit the delivery of viral DNA into the nucleus . Virions can enter from the plasma membrane proximal to the nuclear envelope . These particles are separated from the nucleus by only a few micrometers . Another possibility is that cytosolic virions use an MT - independent transport mechanism , such as an actin - based system ( 36 , 38 ) ; that they are transported on short , randomly oriented MT ﬁlaments resistant to NOC ; or that they exploit diffusion . All of these processes would stop when the capsid binds to the NPC , leading to particle enrich - ment at the nucleus . Clearly , Ad2 - TR particles are able to explore a few micrometers of cytosolic space in the absence of MTs ( 8 , 49 ) ; thus , particles entering from the plasma mem - brane proximal to the nucleus will most likely not require MTs to reach the NPC . This means that careful kinetic measure - ments are necessary to reveal the role of any cytoplasmic trans - port system . We predict that cells that are particularly small will be in - fected in the absence of MTs if enough time is allowed . This scenario may , in fact , have obscured the role of MTs in Ad infection ( 5 , 50 ) . Our measurements here reveal that nuclear transport of both Ad2 and HSV - 1 from distal areas to the nucleus is blocked in the absence of MTs . Since HSV - 1 infec - tion of polarized neuronal cells in a compartmentalized culture absolutely depends on MTs ( 22 ) , the results obtained with HSV - 1 conﬁrm that the quantitative imaging procedures that we used for Ad2 and HSV - 1 are reliable . The role of MTs in cytoplasmic particle trafﬁcking is in agreement with the results of studies of endocytic and exocytic membrane trafﬁc and ax - onal transport , where NOC was found to be a kinetic rather than an absolute inhibitor of membrane trafﬁc ( 9 , 24 ) . Capsid transport and viral gene expression required neither MT treadmilling nor the dynamic instability of MTs , since paclitaxel ( at concentrations of 180 nM to 10 (cid:2) M ) had only slight effects on Ad2 and HSV - 1 infections . Likewise , cells expressing MAP4 , which stabilizes the MT network ( 34 ) , trans - ported Ad2 to the nucleus even faster than control cells ( 49 ) ; low concentrations of paclitaxel or NOC ( 5 nM ) , suppressing MT dynamics without depolymerizing MTs , have similar ef - fects ( 6 , 7 ) . Thus , preferentially stabilized MTs effectively sup - port viral transport to the nucleus . A further indication that Ad2 utilizes MTs for nuclear targeting came from experiments in which transport directionality was controlled . Ad2 was found to stimulate two distinct signaling pathways which both enhance the MT - dependent minus - end - directed transport of Ad2 capsids ( 48 ) . In the absence of stimulation , viral motility was directed toward the cell periphery , dependent on intact MTs . Live imaging of MT - dependent and independent Ad trans - port . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) recently questioned the role of MTs in Ad5 infection . They traced incoming Ad5 that contained a GFP - tetracycline repressor fusion protein ( GFP - TetR ) bound to operator sequences in the Ad5 DNA genome but were not able to detect fast retrograde motions of GFP - TetR - tagged Ad5 , unlike other reports with ﬂuorophore - tagged Ad ( 26 , 48 , 49 ) . There are several not mutually exclusive possibilities for why Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) missed the fast minus - end - directed motility of Ad . The ﬁrst possibility involves temperature . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) used room temperature for their live experiments , whereas we always conducted our live experiments at 37°C with a temper - ature - controlled sample holder . The second possibility involves longer intervals between subsequent frames . While we re - corded frame intervals of 1 to 2 s , Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) used frame intervals of 3 to 5 s . Longer intervals make it less likely that high - speed elementary motion steps will be detected . The third possibility involves imaging with PBS . For their tracing exper - iments , Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) used PBS lacking glucose and other nutrients , whereas we used growth medium without serum ( and sometimes also without phenol red ) . Depending on the duration of the incubation , PBS may reduce the ATP levels in the cells . Interestingly , the vast majority of the particles ( about 15 to 20 particles , corresponding to about 95 % ) in the study of Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) were apparently nonmotile during the 14 - s period depicted in their Fig . 4A . This result is again in contrast to our imaging of 40 to 60 % motile particles ( 7 , 48 , 49 ) . The fourth possibility involves imaging at shorter wavelengths and longer exposure times . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) used GFP - tagged Ad and thus had to use an excitation beam of about 500 nm . Their exposure times were between 1 and 1 . 5 s , whereas our expo - sure times were between 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 s , i . e . , four or ﬁve times shorter and thus less phototoxic . The published images in the study of Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) demonstrate photobleaching effects after as few as ﬁve frames ( their Fig . 4A ) . Phototoxicity is known to affect the viability of cells ; thus , their results are difﬁcult to compare with our data . We imaged the TR ﬂuoro - phore with a 595 - nm excitation and were able to record several hundred subsequent frames ( 48 , 49 ) . The ﬁfth possibility in - volves statistical analysis . Due to the limited data set that Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) were able to collect , their statistical analysis was limited . They processed between 20 and 218 frames per assay , whereas we included several thousand frames per assay . Thus , our standard deviations of the mean are smaller and the differences between various conditions ( e . g . , plus or minus NOC ) are highly signiﬁcant for our measurements ( one - sided t tests ) . The sixth possibility involves the subcellular area of particle tracing . Figure 4 in the study of Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) shows that 8 out of 11 traced particles were in a region proximal to the nucleus , i . e . , separated by less than 10 (cid:2) m from the nuclear envelope . The perinuclear region is known to be elevated com - pared to the ﬂat periphery . Motility in this region can also occur along the z axis and thus toward and away from the detector ; i . e . , the observed velocities in the perinuclear region might have been underestimated . Many studies , including ours , have therefore traced organelles ( 23 ) and viruses ( reviewed in reference 12 ) in the peripheral ﬂat regions of the cytoplasm and have used cells that are extensively spread out ( see , e . g . , reference 30 ) . The ﬁnal possibility involves the nature of GFP - TetR - tagged Ad particles . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) used GFP - TetR - tagged Ad5 in which GFP - TetR was bound to operator se - quences in the genomic DNA . Using biochemical assays , they demonstrated that the tag cofractionated with a viral DNA binding protein at 30 min p . i . , but the stability of this interac - tion later in infection was not characterized . It is also unclear V OL . 76 , 2002 MTs ARE REQUIRED FOR Ad AND HSV - 1 INFECTIONS 9969 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 b y PE NN S T A T E UN I V h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m what fraction of the particles was recovered in their analysis at 30 min p . i . , since the control fractionation sample at 0 min p . i . was missing . They then performed all their ﬂuorescence mo - tility experiments at times between 30 and 80 min p . i . ; thus , it is unknown whether the tag was in fact still on the viral particle . That the tag could prematurely dissociate from the DNA was suggested by their observations that GFP - TetR was not found to be imported into the nucleus but that viral DNA was ap - parently imported . In addition , it is not known whether the tagged DNA was completely packaged into the virion . If pack - aging was incomplete , then it is possible that some of the DNA dissociated from the capsid prior to capsid arrival at the nu - cleus . The dissociated DNA might or might not have been tagged with GFP - TetR and thus might have appeared as ﬂu - orescent puncta . It is likely that these puncta would have had motilities different from those of our Ad2 - TR . Besides these important technical differences in the live ﬂu - orescence experiments , another major difference between the study of Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) and our study is the effect of NOC on the movement of particles to the nucleus . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) found no effect of NOC on the movement of GFP - TetR - tagged Ad DNA . Given the limitations of their tracing exper - iments , this result is not surprising . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) measured slow short - range transport in both control and NOC - treated cells , i . e . , MT - independent transport . Their static analysis , however , showed that GFP - TetR - tagged particles were found at the microtubule organizing center at 30 to 40 min p . i . when MTs were present but not when they were absent . This ﬁnding fully agrees with our ﬁndings and further supports the notion that the live analyses of Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) had technical limi - tations obscuring the detection of fast motility steps . It is important that the ﬂuorescent dots that we detected with Ad2 - TR correspond to single viral particles that have the same infectivity as their “parental” nonlabeled particles ( 33 ) . Quantitative subcellular localization of capsids in static images indicated that in control cells , about 65 % of the Ad2 - TR ac - cumulates over the nuclear and perinuclear region at 90 min p . i . ( 33 ) . This ﬁnding is in good agreement with the Ad2 - TR motilities in epithelial and ﬁbroblastic cells ( e . g . , HeLa cells , rat kangaroo PtK 2 cells , African green monkey TC7 cells , or mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts ) , which are biased toward the nu - cleus and have net population speeds on the order of several micrometers per minute ( 48 , 49 ) . Elementary motility events were between 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 (cid:2) m / s and reached minus - end - di - rected peak velocities of up to 2 . 6 (cid:2) m / s . Moreover , capsids were transported over short ranges as well as long distances , consistent with processive motor - driven motility . Overexpres - sion of the p50 subunit of the dynactin complex or antidynein antibodies indicated that the minus - end - directed MT motor complex dynein - dynactin has a key function in transporting Ad2 as well as HSV - 1 to the nucleus ( 6a , 26 , 49 ) . We conclude that MTs are instrumental for the trafﬁcking of Ad2 and HSV - 1 particles to the nucleus . NOC inhibits Ad and HSV - 1 infections . Consistent with a role of MTs in transporting infectious DNA to the nucleus , we found viral gene expression to be signiﬁcantly inhibited in cells lacking MTs . These cells remained on the substratum and showed no signs of leakiness , i . e . , cell death . With different viruses ( Ad2 , Ad5 , and HSV - 1 ) , different cell lines ( Vero , PtK 2 , A549 , and HeLa ) , different MT - depolymerizing agents ( vinblastine [ 45 ] and NOC [ this study ] ) , different genes ( ICP4 , (cid:3) - Gal , and luciferase [ 45 ; this study ] ) , different promoters ( HSV - 1 ICP4 and CMV immediate early ) , and different MOIs ( from 2 to 100 PFU / cell ) , viral gene expression was in all instances found to be inhibited by 50 to 90 % . Our results again contrast those of Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) . These authors reported data suggesting that NOC had no effect on the expression of luciferase from transgenic Ad5 or on infec - tion , as estimated by counting of immunostained cells express - ing the immediate - early viral protein E1A . NOC also appeared to have no effect on GFP expression encoded by Ad5 , as determined by counting of green ﬂuorescent cells . While the percentage of ﬂuorescent cells can be easily determined , the ﬂuorescent signal may not be linear over a wide range of protein concentrations . Measuring an enzymatic activity , such as luciferase or (cid:3) - Gal , however , allows for unambiguous quan - tiﬁcation if the assay is performed within the linear range of the enzymatic activity . Glotzer et al . ( 8 ) reported that 1 , 000 particles per cell gave an average of about 10 2 luciferase light units at 4 h p . i . , whereas 10 times as much virus ( 10 , 000 par - ticles per cell ) resulted in 5 (cid:4) 10 4 light units . This value is 50 - fold more than what would be expected if the measure - ments followed linear kinetics . Moreover , there was essentially no increase in the luciferase signal from 6 to 24 h p . i . with 10 , 000 particles per cell , suggesting that the assay had been saturated . In summary , we conclude that intact MTs and their associ - ated motors support the transport of infectious Ad and HSV - 1 particles to the nucleus and thereby enhance the kinetics of infection . Based on earlier results ( 14 , 15 , 35 , 45 , 53 ) , we argue that the Ad and HSV - 1 genomes remain enclosed in capsids during their cytosolic passage to the nucleus . Only when these capsids arrive at the NPC will they be disassembled and their DNA released and imported into the nucleus for transcription and replication .
