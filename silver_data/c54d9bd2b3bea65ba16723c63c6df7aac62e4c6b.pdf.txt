Tight junctions ( TJs ) reside immediately below the stratum corneum and regulate the selective permeability of the paracellular pathway . Objective : We evaluated the expression / function of the TJ protein claudin - 1 in epithelium from AD and nonatopic subjects and screened 2 American populations for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the claudin - 1 gene ( CLDN1 ) . Methods : Expression proﬁles of nonlesional epithelium from patients with extrinsic AD , nonatopic subjects , and patients with psoriasis were generated using Illumina’s BeadChips . Dysregulated intercellular proteins were validated by means of tissue staining and quantitative PCR . Bioelectric properties of epithelium were measured in Ussing chambers . Functional relevance of claudin - 1 was assessed by using a knockdown approach in primary human keratinocytes . Twenty - seven haplotype - tagging SNPs in CLDN1 were screened in 2 independent populations with AD . Results : We observed strikingly reduced expression of the TJ proteins claudin - 1 and claudin - 23 only in patients with AD , which were validated at the mRNA and protein levels . Claudin - 1 expression inversely correlated with T H 2 biomarkers . We observed a remarkable impairment of the bioelectric barrier function in AD epidermis . In vitro we conﬁrmed that silencing claudin - 1 expression in human keratinocytes diminishes TJ function while enhancing keratinocyte proliferation . Finally , CLDN1 haplotype - tagging SNPs revealed associations with AD in 2 North American populations . Conclusion : Collectively , these data suggest that an impairment in tight junctions contributes to the barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation observed in AD subjects and that this may be mediated in part by reductions in claudin - 1 .

Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is the most common inﬂammatory skin disease , affecting up to 17 % of children and about 6 % of adults in the United States . 1 , 2 Its cardinal features include dry eczematous skin lesions , a relapsing and often chronic course , and an intense intractable pruritus . Many of these features have been attributed in part to an acquired and / or genetic epidermal barrier defects . Disturbance of the epithelial barrier is now recognized as a com - mon feature in many inﬂammatory diseases , including inﬂamma - tory bowel disease , celiac disease , sinusitis , food allergy , asthma , and AD . 3 , 4 A defect in barrier has been argued to favor the pene - tration or reactivity to microbes , allergens / antigens , and irritants into the dermis and possibly contribute to the T H 2 immune re - sponse observed in early AD lesions . 5 - 7 The skin has 2 barrier structures : the stratum corneum ( SC ) and tight junctions ( TJs ) . 8 It is widely accepted in patients with AD that the SC is dysfunctional as the result of 1 or more of the following defects : ( 1 ) reduced levels of SC lipids 9 - 11 ; ( 2 ) acquired or genetic FromtheDepartmentsof a Dermatologyand d Medicine , e theDivisionofPulmonary & Crit - icalCare Medicine , and f RadiationOncology , UniversityofRochester MedicalCenter ; b Lowe Family Genomics Core , Department of Medicine , and c the Department of Der - matology , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore ; g the Department ofPediatrics , NationalJewishHealth , Denver ; h theDivisionofDermatology , University ofCaliforniaSanDiego ; i theDivisionofImmunology , Children’sHospitalBoston ; l the Department of Dermatology , Oregon Health & Science University , Portland ; m the Department of Dermatology and Allergy , University of Bonn ; n the Department of Dermatology and Allergy , Technische Universit € at M € unchen , Munich ; and o the Depart - ment of Epidemiology , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore .

TJs function as the ‘‘gate’’ for passage of water , ions , and solutes through the paracellular pathway . 16 TJs also regulate the localization of apical and basolateral membrane components . Whether epidermal TJs have this cell polarity function is still de - bated . 17 Some investigators have speculated that TJs might regu - late the lipid components found in the SC . 18 , 19 This has promoted the notion that these 2 epidermal barrier structures interact in a dy - namic way to ensure that the skin is in fact a formidable barrier ( Fig 1 ) . The structure and function of keratinocyte TJs remains an area of active investigation . TJs are composed of a number of transmembrane proteins , such as the claudin family , junctional ad - hesion molecule A , occludin , and tricellulin . In addition , several scaffolding proteins , such as zonulae occludens ( ZO ) - 1 , ZO - 2 , ZO - 3 , multi - PDZ domain protein 1 , membrane - associated guany - late kinase , and cingulin , have been identiﬁed in the TJ cytosolic plaque . 18 Claudins are 4 - transmembrane - spanning proteins that determine TJ resistance and permeability and include more than 24 members . 20 - 22 Based on in vitro experiments , claudins have been divided into those that increase transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) or enhance barrier , including claudin - 1 and claudin - 4 , and claudins that reduce TEER and therefore disrupt barrier function , such as claudin - 2 and claudin - 6 . 23 Although the existence of TJ - like structures in the epidermis has been suggested for some time , 24 the functional relevance of these structures has been addressed only recently . 21 , 25 , 26 A major breakthrough came in 2002 , when Furuse et al 27 reported that claudin - 1 – deﬁcient mice died within 24 hours of birth with wrinkled skin , severe dehydration , and increased epidermal per - meability , as assessed by dye studies and transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) . 27 Importantly , these mice had no abnormalities in the expression of SC proteins ( eg , loricrin , involucrin , transglutaminase - 1 , or Krueppel - like factor 4 ) or lipids that might explain the severe skin phenotype . Although this murine model clearly established the importance of claudin - 1 in skin barrier function , very little is currently known about the role of claudin - 1 ( or TJs ) in human skin diseases . Dysfunction of keratinocyte TJs could explain many of the consequences of a defective skin barrier . For example , increased TEWL , whichisawell - establishedmeasureofskinbarrierintegrity and is notably increased in both lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with AD , is not attributable to FLG mutations ( Fig 1 ) . 28 - 31 Thus other genetic or acquired defects in the skin barrier likely explain increased TEWL . Defective structure and function of TJs could also have immunologic consequences ( Fig 1 ) . For example , Kubo et al 32 recently demonstrated that activated Langerhans cells , the resident antigen - presenting cell in the epidermis , gain access to foreign antigens by sending dendrites out through epidermal TJs . 32 It seems likely that Langerhans cells will be more likely to sample surface antigens and allergens when epidermal TJs are compro - mised . This , coupled with the recentevidence thatLangerhans cells may be specialized to induce the differentiation of naive CD4 1 T cells to T H 2 cells , strongly supports the notion that a breach in TJs is likely a critical feature in the initiation of AD . 33 In the current study we report for the ﬁrst time the reduced expression of a key TJ protein , claudin - 1 , in AD epidermis , which was not observed in patients with psoriasis , a T H 17 - polarized in - ﬂammatory skin disease also associated with barrier defects . 34 , 35 In vitro ﬁndings conﬁrm that reductions in claudin - 1 expression , comparable with those observed in human skin samples , signiﬁ - cantly affect TJ function by using 2 different measures of TJ integrity . Our ex vivo studies with full - thickness epidermal sam - ples demonstrate remarkable bioelectric defects in AD nonle - sional skin and provide more insight into the mechanism of epidermal barrier dysfunction characteristic of AD . Preliminary single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis suggests that the claudin - 1 gene ( CLDN1 ) might be a novel susceptibility gene for AD . Collectively , our studies strongly suggest that claudin - 1 might be a key determinant of skin barrier dysfunction in patients with AD and may play a role in the T H 2 polarization characteristically observed in most subjects . METHODS Study participants : Expression proﬁling and validation experiments The diagnosis of AD was made using the US consensus conference criteria . 36 All patients with AD had extrinsic disease , as deﬁned by a serum total IgE level 2 SDs or more of age - dependent norms and a positive multial - lergenRASTresult ( ImmunoCapPhadiatop ) . Nonatopichealthysubjectswere deﬁned as having no personal or family history of atopic diseases , no personal historyofchronicskinorsystemicdiseases , andaserumtotalIgElevelthatwas 2 SDs or lessof age - dependent norms and a negative Phadiatop . The diagnosis of psoriasis was based on characteristic clinicalfeatures of plaque - type lesions byaboard - certiﬁeddermatologist . Exclusioncriteriawereasfollows : ageof18 yearsorlessor60yearsorgreater , useofsystemicimmunosuppressivetherapy , use of leukotriene inhibitors within the last 6 weeks , use of topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors within the last 6 weeks at the site of blister formation or biopsy , andpresenceof a recent systemicinfection or courseof oral antibiotics within the last 2 weeks . All subjects either underwent an epidermal procure - ment procedure ( see below ) or a 4 - mmpunch biopsy of their non – sun - exposed forearm . These studieswere approved by theResearchSubjectReview Boards at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution , the University of Rochester Medical Center , or both . All subjects provided written informed consent .

Theblisterroof , which consists of full - thickness epidermis , was removed by using a sterile technique and placed in Hank’s balanced salt solution ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , Calif ) . Total RNA was extracted from epidermis by using the QIAshredder spin column and RNeasy RNA isolation kits ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . ThequalityoftotalRNAsamples ( RNAintegritynumber ) wasassessedbyus - ing an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , Calif ) . Samples were selected for microarray analysis if they had a good RNA integ - rity number ( range , 8 - 10 ) . Gene expression proﬁling Biotin - labeled complementary RNA was prepared from total RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Illumina , San Diego , Calif ) . Complementary RNA was hybridized to Illumina Sentrix HumanRef - 8 Expression BeadChips ( Illumina ) , which contain 24 , 350 probes correspond - ingto21 , 429uniquegenes . Signalintensityquantiﬁcationwasperformedwith an Illumina BeadStation 500GX Genetic Analysis Systems scanner . Preliminary analysis of the scanned data was performed with Illumina BeadStudiosoftware , whichreturnssingle - intensitydatavaluesforeachprobe after the computation of a trimmed mean average for each probe represented byavariablenumberof beadprobesonthearray . Z transformationfornormal - ization was performed on each Illumina sample / array on a stand - alone basis , and z ratios were calculated by taking the difference between the averages of the observed gene z xscores and dividing by the SD of all the differences for that particular comparison . 37 Signiﬁcant changes in gene expression between class pairs were calculated by using the z test , 38 and signiﬁcant genes were deﬁned as those that satisfy a z test P value of 6 1 . 5E - 3 . The BeadStudio ex - pressionvaluesforeachsample / arraywerescaled to havea medianof256 and then log 2 transformed . Quantitative PCR Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) was performed with the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit and the iQ SYBER Green Supermix assay system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , Calif ) . All PCR ampliﬁcations were carried out in triplicate on an iQ5 Multicolor real - time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Primers were designed and synthesized by Integrated DNATechnologies ( see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Relative gene expression was calculated by using the 2 - DD Ct method . 39 The normalized threshold cyclevalue of each samplewas calculated by using glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) as an endogenous control gene . Imaging of TJ proteins For immunohistochemical staining , the following antibodies were used : claudin - 1 ( 0 . 2 m g / mL , JAY . 8 ; Zymed , South San Francisco , Calif ) , occludin ( 2 . 5 m g / mL , OC - 3F10 ; Zymed ) , ZO - 1 ( 2 . 5 m g / mL , ZO1 - 1A12 ; Zymed ) , or isotype control . Five - micrometer sections from formalin - ﬁxed skin biopsy specimens were deparafﬁnized and rehydrated . Slides were incubated in 1 3 EDTA solution , pH 8 . 0 , at 95 8 C for 10 minutes . Samples were incubated overnight at 4 8 C , with primary antibodies titered to the lowest concentration that produced immunoreactivity in control samples . The secondary antibodies and detection system used were reported previously . 40 For immunoﬂuores - cence labeling , skin samples were incubated in blocking solution ( 5 % BSA , 0 . 1 % saponin , and 1 mmol / L calcium in PBS ) for 20 minutes , followed by FIG 1 . Skin epithelium is uniquely armed with 2 barrier structures : the SC and TJs . The SC is the outermost structure , consisting of multiple layers of enucleated keratinocytes called corneocytes . The SC barrier is maintained by the complex interaction of the corniﬁed envelope , intracytoplasmic moisturizing factors , and a complex lipid mixture in the extracellular space . 8 TJs are located just below the SC at the level of the stra - tum granulosum . In this article we present evidence that this structure might be compromised in patients with AD , and this may be due to reductions in claudin - 1 levels . These 2 barrier structures interact in a dy - namic way to ensure that the skin maintains a formidable barrier . It is our premise that SC defects alone would not lead to the development or exacerbation of AD . We propose that a breach in both the SC and TJs would be required for sensitization to antigens / allergens , irritants , microbes , pollutants , or possibly even nanoparticles . A recent study demonstrates that the transient disruption of TJs results in the incorpo - ration of Langerhans cell dendrites within a temporary TJ . 32 This extension of the Langerhans cell dendrite would enable antigen uptake and processing and might confer activation signals that would determine the immunologic fate of the antigen - presenting cell – T - cell interaction that follows . A ﬂuorescence image of healthy human epidermis ( left ) demonstrates the expression patterns of 2 key players in AD pathogenesis , namely FLG ( red ) and CLDN1 ( green ) , and pictorially highlights the orientation of the 2 skin barrier compo - nents .

Ex vivo electrophysiologic measurements in Ussing chambers Isolated blister roofs ( 1 cm in diameter ; Fig 2 , B - D ) were placed in the Ussing chamber in 2 - mm - diameter sliders for Snapwell chambers ( area , 0 . 031 cm 2 ; Physiologic Instruments , San Diego , Calif ) , bathed in Ringer lac - tate , and gassed with a mixture of 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . The tissues were continuously voltage clamped to zero by using VCC MC8 ( Physiologic Instruments ) . Transepithelial short - circuit current ( expressed as micro - Angstroms per square centimeter of tissue surface area ) was measured , and total tissue conductance ( expressed as milliSiemens [ mS ] per square centimeter of tissue surface area ) was calculated with Ohm’s law by applying a 5 - mV transepithelial pulse every 20 seconds and measuring the resulting current deﬂections .

Cells were stained with DAPI was to identify nuclei and assess cell density . For each sample , 6 random ﬁelds ( magniﬁcation 3 200 ) were captured . EdU positive cells were counted by 2 investigators blinded to the conditions , and results expressed as mean EdU positive cells / hpf . Genetic study participants DNA was isolated by using standard protocols from 258 unrelated European American ( EA ) patients with AD and 156 healthy control subjects participating in the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Network ( ADVN ) . The same set of markers was genotyped in 176 African American ( AA ) patients with AD and 152 healthy control subjects . Baseline characteristics are presented in Table I , and further details can be found in previous publica - tions . 45 AD was diagnosed by using the US consensus conference criteria . 36 Nonatopic healthy control subjects were deﬁned as having no personal his - tory of chronic disease , including atopy .

The study was approved by the institutional review boards at National Jewish Health , Johns Hopkins University , Oregon Health & Science University , University of California San Diego , Children’s Hospital of Boston , and University of Rochester Medical Center . All subjects provided written informed consent before participation . Genotyping and quality control We performed genotyping on genomic DNA extracted from blood samples with the MagAttract DNA blood Mini M48 kit ( Qiagen ) on a Biorobot M48 , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . DNA quantiﬁcation was performed with Pico - Green ( Molecular Probes ) . Genotyping in these samples was determined for each of the selected tagging SNPs with the Illumina GoldenGate custom panel containing 384 - plex assays according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Illumina ) . Tagging SNPs were selected to represent the CLDN1 gene in both the EA and AA groups . The SNP selection approach was to examine 10 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream in accordance with design score validations based on Illumina in - house measurements and the 60 - bp limitation ( an SNP cannot be closer than 60 bp to another SNP on this oligonucleotide pool assay [ OPA ] ) . We initially selected all available CLDN1 SNPs from the HapMap ( http : / / www . hapmap . org / ) to tag the linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) blocks in each of the ethnic groups ( EA and AA subjects ) . Tagging was based on the LDSelect algorithm , 47 , 48 with a minor allele frequency of 10 % or greater and an r 2 threshold of 0 . 80 ( as reported in HapMap ) to ensure nearly perfect LD and infer information on all SNPs captured by the tag set . A ﬁnal selection included 27 SNPs chosen for the Illumina OPA . Of the 27 tagging SNPs se - lected , 24 qualiﬁed as tagging SNPs from both the HapMap CEPH Utah ( CEU , with European ancestry ) and the HapMap Yoruba ( YRI , with African ancestry ) samples ; an additional 3 tagging SNPs ( rs6800425 , rs1155884 , and rs9809713 ) were genotyped only in the AA subjects . Two LD blocks were observed among the EA group ( block 1 : rs10212165 , rs3954259 , and rs9290929 [ D 9 5 0 . 982 - 1 . 0 ] ; block 2 : rs9835663 and rs3732923 [ D 9 5 0 . 976 ] ) , and 3 LD blocks were observed among the AA group ( block 1 : rs3954259 and rs9290929 [ D 9 5 1 . 0 ] ; block 2 : rs893051 , rs9839711 , and rs9835663 [ D 9 5 0 . 957 - 1 . 0 ] ; block 3 : rs6800425 and rs3774028 [ D 9 5 1 ] ) by using the criteria of Gabriel et al . 49 The 27 SNPs were genotyped by using the custom - designed Illumina OPA for the BeadXpress Reader System and the GoldenGate Assay with VeraCode Bead technology ( San Diego , Calif ) , according to the manufacturer’s proto - col . 50 Genotypingquality was high , with an average completion rate of 97 . 2 % to98 . 2 % fortheBeadXpressgenotyping ( seethecompleteMethodssectionin this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . All samples were also genotyped for the 2 FLG mutations most commonly associated with AD in EA subjects ( R501X and 2282del4 ) , plus 9 additional polymorphisms ( rs12730241 , rs2065956 , rs11582620 , rs3126082 , rs6587665 , rs11204980 , rs1933063 , rs1933064 , andrs3126091 ) , aspreviously described . 51 Interaction among FLG mutations previouslyassociatedwithAD and haplotype - tagging SNPs in FLG and CLDN1 SNPs were investigated by usingPLINKepistasis . DNAsamplesfromsubjectsenrolledfortheimmunos - taining study were also genotyped for the same 2 FLG null mutations . Statistical analysis Data were expressed as means 6 SEMs of 3 or more experiments . Differences between groups were evaluated by using an appropriate t test . A P value of . 05 or less was considered statistically signiﬁcant .

This was reﬂected in an increased permeability to FITC - conjugated albumin in patients with AD ( 445 6 24 OD / cm 2 / h , n 5 4 ) compared with that seen in nonatopic control subjects ( 175 6 68 OD / cm 2 / h , P 5 . 02 , n 5 4 ) .

RESULTS Claudin - 1 expression is markedly reduced in nonlesional AD epidermis To characterize and quantify the expression of human epider - mal proteins important for barrier function , we performed gene expression proﬁling of nonlesional or clinically unaffected epi - dermis by using blister roofs from patients with AD , patients with psoriasis , and nonatopic subjects ( Fig 2 , B - D ) . The Illumina Sen - trix HumanRef - 8 Chip contained 43 TJ genes ( see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) , 8 gap junction genes , and 41 epidermal differentiation complex genes . A number of the epidermal differentiation complex genes were differentially expressed in epidermis from patients with AD ver - sus nonatopic nonlesional epidermis , and several ( eg , S100A8 , S100A7 , FLG , and LOR ; see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repos - itory at www . jacionline . org ) corroborate the ﬁndings observed by others in lesional skin biopsy specimens . 52 , 53 Of note , FLG was downregulated in patients with AD versus nonatopic subjects ( z ratio , 2 5 . 29 ) ; however , the P value of . 01 did not reach the sig - niﬁcance threshold . Using the expression proﬁling array data from nonatopic control subjects , we veriﬁed that human keratino - cytes express claudin - 1 , claudin - 4 , claudin - 8 , claudin - 12 , and claudin - 14 54 - 56 and demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that they also express claudin - 15 and claudin - 23 ( Illumina detection values > _ 0 . 99 , data not shown ) . Interestingly , of the intracellular junction genes , claudin - 1 met our criteria for signiﬁcance , demonstrating reduced expression in patients with AD with a z ratio of 2 2 . 4 and a P value of . 0013 compared with nonatopic subjects ( Fig 2 , A , red highlights ) . We observed no difference in claudin - 1 expres - sion in patients with psoriasis compared with that seen in nona - topic control subjects ( P 5 . 98 ; Fig 2 , A , red highlights ) . We also noted reduced expression of claudin - 23 ( z ratio , 2 3 . 2 ; P 5 . 0062 ) in AD epithelium compared with that from nonatopic sub - jects , but the difference was only marginally signiﬁcant ( Fig 2 , A , red highlights ) . Furthermore , patients with AD displayed en - hanced expression of the gap junction proteins connexin - 26 ( GJB2 ; z ratio , 1 5 . 2 ; P 5 . 025 ) and connexin - 62 ( GJA10 ; z ratio , 1 1 . 6 ; P 5 . 001 ; Fig 2 , A , red highlights ) . Patients with AD did not show decreased expression of proteins relevant for adherens junc - tions or desmosomes ( data not shown ) . Importantly , the expres - sion of a number of differentiation genes was either not affected or increased in patients with AD compared with that seen in control subjects ( Fig 2 , A , yellow - highlighted genes ) , in - dicating that the observed changes in TJ genes did not simply re - ﬂect dedifferentiation of the epidermis . We conﬁrmed the reduced expression of claudin - 1 in blister roofs obtained from newly re - cruited patients with AD and nonatopic subjects ( n 5 5 per group ) by means of qPCR ( patients with AD : 38 . 4 6 7 . 1 relative value units vs nonatopic subjects : 69 . 7 6 9 . 5 ; P 5 . 03 ; Fig 2 , E ) . We also conﬁrmed the reduced expression of claudin - 23 ( patients FIG 7 . Claudin - 1 silencing reduces TEER , increases paracellular permeability , and enhances cell prolifer - ation .

B , Immunostaining conﬁrmed that claudin - 1 , but not occludin , expression was reduced in differentiated PHKs after transfection with CLDN1 siRNA ( bars 5 50 m m ) . C , Claudin - 1 knockdown signiﬁcantly reduced TEER ( control : 164 . 0 6 18 . 2 and CLDN1 siRNA : 80 . 6 6 6 . 4 , * P 5 . 007 , n 5 4 ) .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MARCH 2011 780 DE BENEDETTO ET AL with AD : 0 . 23 6 0 . 04 relative value units vs nonatopic subjects : 0 . 81 6 0 . 12 ; P 5 . 001 ) and the enhanced expression of connexin - 26 ( GBJ2 ; patients with AD : 18 . 87 6 6 . 7 vs nonatopic subjects : 3 . 73 6 0 . 26 ; P 5 . 03 ) in patients with AD versus nonatopic con - trol subjects by means of qPCR ( Fig 2 , F ) . Although we consid - ered the reduced expression of claudin - 23 in AD samples very interesting , we were limited in our ability to pursue this ﬁnding by the lack of reliable reagents . Additional studies are clearly needed to clarify the role played by claudin - 23 in epidermal bar - rier function . To investigate claudin - 1 expression in intact skin , we compared skin biopsy specimens from nonlesional AD skin with those from nonatopic subjects by using both immunohistochemistry ( Fig 3 , A and B ) and immunoﬂuorescent / confocal microscopy ( Fig 3 , C and D ) . Claudin - 1 immunoreactivity was detectable in bright - ﬁeld images in all suprabasal layers , whereas occludin and ZO - 1 were detected only in the upper granulosum layer where TJs form ( data not shown ) . This pattern has been noted by other inves - tigators . 16 , 57 Importantly , the expression of claudin - 1 was mark - edly reduced in nonlesional skin from patients with AD compared with that seen in nonatopic control subjects ( Fig 3 , A - D ) . Semiquantitative claudin - 1 scoring conﬁrmed the markedly reduced staining ( > _ 50 % ) in the epidermis of patients with AD ( 1 . 3 6 0 . 3 ) compared with that seen in nonatopic subjects ( 2 . 9 6 0 . 1 , P < . 0004 ) , and the highly signiﬁcant P value demon - strates the remarkable uniformity of staining intensity within each group ( Fig 3 , E ) . Immunoﬂuorescent staining more clearly dem - onstrated claudin - 1 immunoreactivity on the cell membranes . The signal intensity was again signiﬁcantly less in AD samples ( Fig 3 , C and D ) . These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst indication , to our knowledge , that the skin barrier defect in patients with AD might extend beyond the SC and include TJs . AD epidermis shows defective bioelectric properties We next investigated the functional impairment of TJ barrier in AD epidermis by measuring bioelectric characteristics in Ussing chambers . This approach has been used in human and murine models to evaluate the TJ bioelectric property of mucosal epithelia . 58 , 59 The technique is based on the principle that an in - tact semipermeable membrane will maintain the electrochemical potential gradient generated artiﬁcially by bathing each side of the epidermal sheets with solutions of different ionic strength . 60 , 61 A leaky membrane will allow easy diffusion across the membrane and thus loss of electrochemical potential . Thus the higher the permeability across a membrane , the lower the potential gradi - ent . 59 , 62 TEERs were stable and typically quite high , indicating intact paracellular barrier function of the electrically active epi - thelium . Using this approach , AD epidermis showed a dramati - cally lower resistance ( 92 . 0 6 22 . 0 V 3 cm 2 , n 5 3 ) compared with the nonatopic subjects ( 827 . 0 6 173 . 3 V 3 cm 2 , P 5 . 01 , n 5 4 ; Fig 4 , A ) . The lower resistance observed in the Ussing chambers was consistent with the increased permeability of FITC - conjugated albumin in AD samples ( 445 6 24 OD / cm 2 / h , n 5 3 ) compared with nonatopic samples ( 175 6 68 OD / cm 2 / h , P 5 . 02 , n 5 4 ; Fig 4 , A ) . To better investigate the paracellular permeability properties , we measured the relative permeability of Cl 2 and Na 1 ( P Cl / P Na ) . 42 If P Cl / P Na is equal to 1 , then there is no selectivity and FIG 8 .

The standard cutoff for signiﬁcance ( P 5 . 05 ) is shown as a horizontal solid line . Outcomes included risk of AD ( diamonds ) , early age of onset ( < 5 years ; triangle ) , and the clinical scoring system called EASI ( circles ) in AA ( blue ) and EA ( green ) populations . J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 127 , NUMBER 3 DE BENEDETTO ET AL 781 the membrane is freely permeable . Dilution potential studies on epidermal sheets showed that membrane selectivity is preserved in skin from nonatopic subjects , with Na 1 ions relatively more permeable than Cl 2 ions ( 0 . 77 6 0 . 03 – fold P Cl / P Na ) . However , in samples from patients with AD , the selectivity was completely lost ( 1 . 10 6 0 . 02 – fold P Cl / P Na , P 5 . 001 , n 5 3 / group ) because both ions were equally permeable ( Fig 4 , B ) . Claudin - 1 expression inversely correlated with T H 2 biomarkers To address whether expression levels of epidermal claudin - 1 might modulate adaptive immune responses , we looked at the relationship between claudin - 1 mRNA expression in our epider - mal samples from patients with AD , patients with psoriasis , and nonatopic control subjects and biomarkers of T H 2 polarity , namely serum total IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophilia ( Fig 5 , A and B ) . Claudin - 1 levels were inversely correlated with both total IgE levels ( r 5 2 0 . 718 , P 5 . 0038 ) and eosinophil numbers ( r 5 2 0 . 761 , P 5 . 0016 ) , suggesting that reductions in this key TJ barrier protein might affect the character of the immune response to environmental allergens or vice versa . Claudin - 1 localizes to TJs only in differentiated human keratinocytes Claudin - 1 protein is expressed in PHKs in vitro but colocalizes with other TJ proteins at the cell membrane only after Ca 2 1 - in - duced differentiation ( Fig 6 , A ) . Confocal microscopy demon - strated that claudin - 1 colocalizes with occludin and ZO - 1 at the areas of cell - cell contact only in PHKs grown in media with a high concentration of Ca 2 1 ( Hi Ca , 1 . 9 mmol / L ) for at least 24 hours after conﬂuency . Interestingly , in undifferentiated PHKs grown in 0 . 3 mmol / L Ca 2 1 ( Lo Ca ) – containing media , claudin - 1 immunoreactivity was faint and largely nuclear or perinuclear , whereas occludin was undetectable ( Fig 6 , A ) , and ZO - 1 was lo - calized on the membrane with a discontinuous pattern ( data not shown ) . Next we investigated the functional relevance of these Ca 2 1 - induced changes in TJ protein expression and localization . We observed during Ca 2 1 - induced PHK differentiation a dramatic ( approximately 300 - fold ) increase in TEER , which peaked be - tween 30 and 60 hours after exposure to high extracellular Ca 2 1 ( Fig 6 , B ) and conﬁrmed previously published stud - ies . 27 , 63 - 67 Additionally , we showed that sodium ﬂuorescein ﬂux was markedly reduced in differentiated PHKs ( 3 . 1 6 0 . 6 – fold , P 5 . 046 ; Fig 6 , C ) . T H 2 cytokines enhance claudin - 1 expression and TJ barrier function Previous studies have shown that claudin - 1 expression in noncutaneous epithelial cells can be modulated by cytokines and growth factors . 68 - 70 Recent ﬁndings from murine models support the hypothesis that IL - 4 could delay skin barrier recov - ery . 71 , 72 We therefore wondered whether claudin - 1 downregula - tion observed in AD nonlesional skin biopsy specimens could be secondary to T H 2 cytokines . A corollary to this hypothesis is that even nonlesional skin has been shown to express T H 2 cyto - kines . 73 To test this possibility , PHKs were differentiated in the presence or absence of T H 2 cytokines , IL - 4 , and IL - 13 , and the expression of claudin - 1 , occludin , and ZO - 1 was evaluated . We observed a signiﬁcant enhancement of claudin - 1 expression after IL - 4 ( 48 hours , 50 ng / mL ; 2 . 1 6 0 . 4 – fold over control subjects ; P 5 . 05 ; n 5 3 ) and IL - 13 ( 48 hours , 50 ng / mL ; 1 . 6 6 0 . 3 – fold over control subjects ; P 5 . 1 ; n 5 3 ) stimulation ( Fig 6 , D ) . No synergism was noted with either cytokine , and interestingly , we observed no effect on the expression of occludin and ZO - 1 ( data not shown ) . We then investigated the effect of IL - 4 and IL - 13 on PHK barrier function . A signiﬁcant increase in TEER peak was observed in IL - 4 ( 50 ng / mL ) – treated PHKs ( 166 6 24 V 3 cm 2 vs 109 6 11 V 3 cm 2 for medium alone ; P 5 . 03 ; n 5 4 ) . Dose - response experiments conﬁrmed IL - 4’s effect on TEER ( dose range , 0 . 5 - 100 ng / mL ; data not shown ) , whereas IL - 13 ( dose range , 0 . 5 - 100 ng / mL ) induced only a slight increase in TEER ( data not shown ) . The mechanisms by which T H 2 cyto - kines paradoxically enhance barrier function in our PHKs is currently unknown , but these data suggest that the reduced claudin - 1 expression and TJ dysfunction observed in patients with AD are not due to the actions of T H 2 cytokines . Alterna - tively , we cannot rule out the possibility that AD epithelium would respond differently to T H 2 cytokines , and therefore studies are planned to address this possibility . Therefore at this point we cannot exclude the possibility that the impaired barrier observed in AD epidermis is a consequence of the T H 2 cytokines present in the underlying dermis . Claudin - 1 knockdown disrupts TJ function and increased PHK proliferation We used an RNA interference approach to evaluate the effect that claudin - 1 reduction has on measures of TJ function ( TEER and permeability ) and proliferation . Fig 7 , A , shows that claudin - 1 – speciﬁc siRNA induced a dose - dependent and signiﬁcant TABLE I .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MARCH 2011 782 DE BENEDETTO ET AL ( < _ 60 % ) decrease in protein expression compared with scrambled siRNA - transfected cells . Because the claudin - 1 knockout mouse dies shortly after birth and our tissue staining demonstrated ap - proximately 50 % reduction in claudin - 1 immunoreactivity in AD compared with nonatopic epithelium ( Fig 3 ) , we chose to per - form our functional assessments with a dose of siRNA ( 100 nmol / L ) that reduced claudin - 1 transcripts by a similar amount ( P 5 . 01 ) . With only a 50 % reduction in claudin - 1 , TEER decreased by 50 % or more ( Fig 7 , C ; control : 164 6 18 V 3 cm 2 and CLDN1 siRNA : 81 6 6 V 3 cm 2 ; P 5 . 007 ; n 5 4 ) , and perme - ability to sodium ﬂuorescein increased by a similar extent ( Fig 7 , D ; control : 28 6 12 and CLDN1 siRNA : 52 6 9 ; P 5 . 026 ; n 5 4 ) when compared with that seen in the scrambled siRNA - transfected PHKs . Yamamoto et al 63 used a similar knockdown strategy but observed a more modest effect ( 14 % reduction ) on TEER and did not assess TJ function by using a permeability as - say . We also investigated the effect of claudin - 1 knockdown on connexin - 26 ( GJB2 ) because this was upregulated in AD array samples . We observed enhanced expression of connexin - 26 in our knockdowns ( 1 . 7 6 0 . 8 – fold over control ; P 5 . 05 ; n 5 6 ; see Fig E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Using a proliferation assay based on EdU incorporation , we noted that claudin - 1 – depleted cells have more proliferating cells ( 21 . 6 6 1 . 4 EdU - positive cells per high - powered ﬁeld ) compared with control ( 8 . 1 6 2 . 0 EdU - positive cells per high - powered ﬁeld ; P 5 . 002 ; n 5 3 ; Fig 7 , E ) . These studies conﬁrm and ex - tend ( with permeability and proliferation assays ) previously pub - lished studies , 27 , 63 - 67 which have implicated claudin - 1 as a critical protein for the establishment of a functional paracellular epidermal barrier . The proliferation we observed in claudin - 1 knockdowns suggests that this might be responsible for the en - hanced epithelial thickness or acanthosis observed in nonlesional AD skin . CLDN1 variants are associated with risk of AD Because our ﬁndings strongly implicated claudin - 1 as a critical element in the risk of AD , we took advantage of the ongoing National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – funded ADVN , which is currently enrolling patients with AD and nonatopic subjects ( reviewed in a previous publication 45 ) to ex - amine whether common variants in the human CLDN1 gene might be associated with susceptibility to AD and disease sever - ity . Two independent groups ( EA and AA subjects ) of patients with AD and healthy control subjects were enrolled ( Table I ) . In brief , AD was diagnosed by using the US consensus conference criteria , 36 and AD severity was deﬁned according to the EASI , a standardized grading system . 46 Twenty - seven CLDN1 SNPs spanning a 31 . 5 - kb region on chromosome 3q28 - q29 were se - lected by using a haplotype - tagging approach , of which 24 were common to both ethnic groups ( see Table E3 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Adjusting for 10 , 000 permutations , we observed the most signiﬁcant associations for a lower risk of AD in the AA group for an intronic SNP ( rs17501010 ) between the third and fourth exons of CLDN1 ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 3 - 0 . 8 ; P 5 . 003 ) and an adjacent SNP ( rs9290927 ) downstream of rs17501010 that was associated with a higher risk of AD ( OR , 1 . 8 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 0 - 3 . 3 ; P 5 . 004 ; Fig 8 and see Table E4 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . SNP rs17501010 also showed a modest association with early - onset AD ( < 5 years of age : P 5 . 04 ) . In ad - dition , 2 SNPs ( rs893051 in intron 1 and rs9290929 in the pro - moter region ) were associated with greater disease severity ( OR , 1 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 2 . 1 ; P 5 . 010 ; and OR , 1 . 6 , 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 2 . 3 ; P 5 . 007 , respectively ; Fig 8 and see Table E4 ) . Modest as - sociations were observed in the EA group , including a promoter SNP ( rs16865373 ) and lower risk of AD ( OR , 0 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 2 - 0 . 9 ; P 5 . 034 ) and lower risk of early - onset AD ( < 5 years of age : OR , 0 . 4 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 ; P 5 . 034 ; Fig 8 and see Table E4 ) . Haplotype analyses were performed but did not alter the ev - idence for association for any of the outcomes , including the FLG null mutation ( eg , R501X and 2282del4 ) phenotype ( data not shown ) . Considering the importance of FLG mutations in patients with AD and its subphenotypes , we also evaluated whether there was an interaction between haplotype - tagging SNPs in FLG and CLDN1 . No signiﬁcant interaction effect was found . Despite the limitations of relatively small sample sizes , these ﬁndings suggest that CLDN1 genetic variations might determine the risk for and severity of AD in ethnically diverse populations and that this ap - pears to be independent of FLG . DISCUSSION This is the ﬁrst report , to our knowledge , implicating a TJ defect in patients with AD , a human skin disease that affects up to 15 million Americans . We demonstrated reduced expression of epidermal claudin - 1 in AD nonlesional epidermis ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . This was speciﬁc for AD and not observed in patients with psoriasis , a T H 17 - driven inﬂammatory skin disorder ( Fig 2 ) . Although previous psoriasis publications have suggested that TJs might be altered in lesional epidermis , this has not been consistently observed by other groups . 56 , 74 - 76 Adapting the Us - sing chamber to measure bioelectric properties of stratiﬁed squamous epithelium enabled us to characterize skin barrier properties from human subjects . Using this approach , we ob - served a remarkable alteration in the bioelectric characteristics of AD epidermis with markedly lower electrical resistance and higher albumin permeability that was associated with the loss of ion selectivity permeability ( Fig 4 ) . These defects are the signature of a TJ defect . Our ﬁndings are highly consistent with observations made from genetically altered mice . For example , the claudin - 1 knockout mouse dies within 24 hours of birth with wrinkled skin , severe dehydration , and increased epidermal permeability , as measured by dye studies and TEWL . 27 Importantly , these mice have no ab - normalities in the expression of SC proteins or lipids that might explain their severe skin phenotype . Another recent study re - ported disruption of the epidermal barrier and severe dermatitis in transgenic mice overexpressing an adhesion - deﬁcient mutant of claudin - 6 in the suprabasal compartment of the skin . 77 Interest - ingly , a marked downregulation of claudin - 1 expression was noted in these transgenic mice . It is tempting to speculate that the reduction in claudin - 1 rather than the adhesion - defective clau - din - 6 per se was responsible for the barrier disruption observed in this mouse . Lopardo et al 66 also observed reduced claudin - 1 ex - pression in the epidermis of p63 mutant mice . These mice have a severe skin phenotype and die of dehydration within 1 day of birth , similar to the claudin - 1 knockout mice . In summary , these murine models have highlighted the critical importance of claudin - 1 for a functional epidermal TJ . J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 127 , NUMBER 3 DE BENEDETTO ET AL 783 Recently , a human syndrome caused by an exonic mutation in CLDN1 has been described . 78 - 80 Patients with this syndrome , called neonatal ichthyosis - sclerosing cholangitis , have features in common with AD , namely erythema , dry ﬂaky skin , and patchy alopecia , in addition to unique features , such as severe liver and gallbladder abnormalities that likely arise because of the importance of claudin - 1 in the barrier integrity of bile canaliculi . 78 , 79 Our in vitro studies with PHK monolayers demonstrating a clear association between claudin - 1 levels and TEER conﬁrmed previous work . 63 , 81 , 82 We extended these ﬁndings by demonstrat - ing that claudin - 1 knockdown also enhanced TJ permeability and proliferation ( Fig 7 ) . In our study the claudin - 1 siRNAwas target speciﬁc , with no changes observed in the expression or localiza - tion , of other critical TJ proteins ( occludin and ZO - 1 ) , adherens junction components ( E - cadherin and nectin - 1 ) or SC proteins ( ﬁlaggrin ; see Fig E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Additionally , we were able to reduce claudin - 1 expression by approximately 50 % , which is similar to the reductions we observed in claudin - 1 immunoreactivity of AD epidermis , and this resulted in a remarkable reduction ( approximately 50 % ) in TJ function ( based on both electrical re - sistance and permeability assays , Fig 7 ) . Although immunolabel - ing data allow only a correlative link between claudin - 1 expression and the development of the epidermal barrier , our RNA interference result demonstrated a causal connection be - tween these 2 events ( Fig 7 ) . Recent studies with different types of mammalian epithelia indicated that the epithelial barrier is determined by 2 different components : charge - selective small pores that are permeable to molecules with up to a 4 - m m radius and large , poorly - deﬁned breaks of the barrier without size or charge selectivity ( reviewed in Anderson and Van Itallie 83 ) . TEER reﬂects small - pore perme - ability , whereas ﬂux of FITC with a reported Stokes’ radius of ap - proximately 5 . 5 (cid:2) A measures the permeability of large barrier breaks . Knockdown of claudin - 1 in PHK monolayers decreased TEER and increased FITC ﬂux , which implicates claudin - 1 in regulation of both paracellular pores and breaks in the epidermal barrier . These ﬁndings strongly suggest that the skin of patients with AD would also be more permissive to a number of relevant environmental allergens , such as house dust mite . Puriﬁed aller - gens from the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus have a diameter of approximately 1 . 6 (cid:2) A , as determined by means of radiographic crystallography , and therefore could penetrate even small paracellular pores formed by epithelial TJs . 84 Thus de - fective expression and function of claudin - 1 in patients with AD provides a plausible molecular mechanism for increased sensiti - zation to environmental antigens , allergens , irritants , or pollutants ( Fig 1 ) . This is in keeping with the distinction that AD is the al - lergic disorder with the greatest and most diverse allergen reactiv - ity , as reﬂected in high serum total IgE values . AD is also recognized for a reduced cutaneous irritancy threshold that could simply reﬂect greater epidermal penetration of irritants ( Fig 1 ) . Importantly , TJ disruption is a leading hypoth - esis to explain allergen reactivity in the airways , which manifests as asthma and allergic rhinitis or , in the intestinal tract , as food allergy . 3 , 85 , 86 Although we observed an inverse correlation between claudin - 1 expression and markers of T H 2 polarity , we did not ﬁnd that T H 2 cytokines ( IL - 4 and IL - 13 alone or together ) reduced claudin - 1 expression but in fact observed the opposite . This induction of claudin - 1 was observed in conjunction with enhanced TJ func - tion ( eg , TEER ) and suggests that T H 2 cytokines have a reparative effect on TJs in normal keratinocytes . Whether the actions of these T H 2 cytokines would be different in AD epidermis will re - quire further study . Interestingly , T H 2 cytokines have been shown to reduce the expression of several SC components important for skin barrier function . 72 At this point , we conclude that TJ dys - function observed in AD epidermis is not likely caused by T H 2 milieu , which is present even at nonlesional sites . Instead , we would hypothesize that the connection we observed between TJ function and biomarkers of T H 2 polarity suggest that AD TJ de - fects enable or promote T H 2 responses , possibly by enhancing the trafﬁcking of nonself antigens that are responsible for trigger - ing the T H 2 response in genetically predisposed persons . Alterna - tively , the upregulation of claudin - 1 in response to IL - 4 and IL - 13 might represent a compensatory immune response to ‘‘protect’’ against further antigen uptake through the skin . In preliminary studies we evaluated genetic associations between CLDN1 polymorphisms and AD . We undertook a haplotype - tagging SNP approach using genetic markers available in the public arena ( n 5 132 in dbSNP ) in 414 EA subjects and 328 AA subjects . Interestingly , CLDN1 is localized on chromo - some 3q28 - q29 , very close to the ATOD1 locus for AD . 87 Adjust - ing for 10 , 000 permutations to reduce a type I error caused by multiple comparisons , we observed several modest associations ( P 5 . 003 - . 05 ) between variants throughout the CLDN1 gene and the outcomes associated with AD , especially among AA sub - jects . In separate studies we tested for associations between sev - eral of the same CLDN1 SNPs and risk of disease among a more robustly powered German dataset of patients with AD and control subjects ; however , the full set of SNPs genotyped in the ADVN study were not available for direct comparisons , and phenotyping approaches differed ( data not shown ) . Further studies are under - way for comprehensive joint analyses between ADVN and the German study . Interestingly , CLDN1 variants were also associ - ated with asthma and its related traits , total serum IgE levels and FEV 1 , in 2 independent populations of African descent ( K . Barnes , unpublished data ) . In addition , the rs893051 SNP associ - ated with AD severity in our AA population was also associated with asthma and disease severity in a population of African de - scent . As part of the ADVN study , our population was also screened for the 2 most frequent FLG mutations ( R501X and 2282del4 , Table I ) and 9 haplotype - tagging SNPs throughout the FLG gene . 51 There were no signiﬁcant interaction effects be - tween haplotype - tagging SNPs in FLG and CLDN1 SNPs . More - over , in the AA population , in which we had the strongest association with CLDN1 SNPs , the 2 FLG mutations were consid - erably less common than in our EA population . 51 Our ﬁndings provide suggestive evidence for a role for CLDN1 variants in AD and its associated phenotypes , further supporting the impor - tance of CLDN1 in patients with AD . In conclusion , this study provides the ﬁrst evidence that epidermal TJs are defective in patients with AD , the most common human skin disease . We observed that claudin - 1 is selectively reduced in the epidermis of patients with AD and that CLDN1 might be a novel AD susceptibility gene . Epidermal sam - ples from patients with AD had remarkable defects in resistance and ion transport compared with those from healthy control sub - jects . Using the model of human keratinocyte monolayers , we observed enhanced claudin - 1 expression and recruitment to inter - cellular junctions on cell differentiation , which coincided with the J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MARCH 2011 784 DE BENEDETTO ET AL development of a paracellular barrier . Selective downregulation of claudin - 1 expression markedly increased paracellular permea - bility , decreased resistance , and enhanced proliferation indicative of a wound repair response . We hypothesize that the reduced ex - pression of claudin - 1 in AD epidermis might enhance the penetra - tion of many relevant environmental antigens , leading to greater allergen sensitization , as well as greater susceptibility to irritants / pollutants and possibly even altered microbial ﬂora ( Fig 1 ) . The inverse relationship between claudin - 1 and serum to - tal IgE values also suggests that this defect might promote T H 2 re - sponses . Collectively , these data suggest that barrier dysfunction in patients with AD extends beyond the SC to TJs , the second bar - rier structure , and that barrier regulation provides a novel thera - peutic opportunity in patients with AD and possibly other atopic disorders .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MARCH 2011 786 DE BENEDETTO ET AL METHODSGenotyping and quality control We performed genotyping on genomic DNA extracted from blood samples using the MagAttract DNA blood Mini M48 kit ( Qiagen ) on a Biorobot M48 , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . DNA quantiﬁcation was performed with Pico - Green ( Molecular Probes ) . Genotyping in these samples was determined for each of the selected tagging SNPs with the Illumina GoldenGate custom panel containing 384 - plex assays , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Tagging SNPs were selected to represent the CLDN1 gene in both the EA and AA groups . The SNP selection approach was to examine 10 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream in accordance with design score validations based on Illumina in - house measurements and the 60 - bp limitation ( an SNP cannot be closer than 60 bp to another SNP on this OPA ) . We initially selected all available CLDN1 SNPs from the HapMap ( http : / / www . hapmap . org / ) to tag the LD blocks in each of the ethnic groups ( EA and AA subjects ) . Tagging was based on the LDSelect algorithm , with a minor allele frequency of 10 % orgreaterand an r 2 thresholdof 0 . 80 ( as reportedin HapMap ) toensure nearly perfect LD to infer information on all SNPs captured by the tag set . A ﬁnal se - lection included 27 SNPs chosen for the Illumina OPA . Of the 27 tagging SNPs selected , 24 qualiﬁed as tagging SNPs from both the HapMap CEPH Utah ( CEU , with European ancestry ) and HapMap Yoruba ( YRI , with African ancestry ) samples ; an additional 3 tagging SNPs ( rs6800425 , rs1155884 , and rs9809713 ) were genotyped only in the AA subjects . Two LD blocks were ob - served among the EA group ( block 1 : rs10212165 , rs3954259 , and rs9290929 [ D 9 5 0 . 982 - 1 . 0 ] ; block 2 : rs9835663 and rs3732923 [ D 9 5 0 . 976 ] ) , and 3 LD blocks were observed among the AA group ( block 1 : rs3954259 and rs9290929 [ D 9 5 1 . 0 ] ; block 2 : rs893051 , rs9839711 , and rs9835663 [ D 9 5 0 . 957 - 1 . 0 ] ; block 3 : rs6800425 and rs3774028 [ D 9 5 1 ] ) by using the criteria of Gabriel et al . E1 The 27 SNPs were genotyped by using the custom - designed Illumina OPA for the BeadXpress Reader System and the GoldenGate Assay with VeraCode Bead technology ( San Diego , Calif ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . E2 Brieﬂy , the GoldenGate assay uses 3 primers designedfor each lo - cus . Two are speciﬁc to each allele at the SNP site , and a third hybridizes at a downstream locus from the site . All 3 primers have regions complementary to both genome and universal PCR primer sites . A total of 250 ng of high - quality gDNAwas plated and then activated . The activated DNA , paramagnetic par - ticles , assay oligos , and hybridization buffer are combined in a hybridization step to allow DNA to bind to the particles . After hybridization of primers , plates were washed to reduce noise , and allele - speciﬁc oligos were extended and ligated to the downstream locus - speciﬁc primer . This mix then served as a PCR template with the universal primers P1 , P2 , and P3 . P1 and P2 are Cy3 and Cy5 labeled . After downstream processing , the single - stranded dye - labeled PCR products were hybridized to their complement VeraCode bead type . Plates were then scanned in the BeadXpress Reader for ﬂuores - cence and code identiﬁcation . Scanned data and oligo assignments were up - loaded into Illumina’s BeadStudio software for downstream genotype cluster analysis . Genotyping quality was high , with an average completion rate of 97 . 2 % to 98 . 2 % for the BeadXpress genotyping . REFERENCES E1 .
