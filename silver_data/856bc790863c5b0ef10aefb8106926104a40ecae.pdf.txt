In the present study , we characterized the action mechanisms of 3 - ( 4 - [ 4 - ( [ 1 - ( 2 - chlorophenyl ) ethoxy ] car - bonyl amino ) - 3 - methyl - 5 - isoxazolyl ] benzylsulfanyl ) propanoic acid ( Ki16425 ) on the EDG - family LPA receptors . Ki16425 in - hibited several responses specific to LPA , depending on the cell types , without any appreciable effect on the responses to other related lipid receptor agonists , including sphingosine 1 - phosphate . With the cells overexpressing LPA 1 , LPA 2 , or LPA 3 , we examined the selectivity and mode of inhibition by Ki16425 against the LPA - induced actions and compared them with those of dioctyl glycerol pyrophosphate ( DGPP 8 : 0 ) , a recently identified antagonist for LPA receptors . Ki16425 inhib - ited the LPA - induced response in the decreasing order of LPA 1 (cid:1) LPA 3 (cid:1)(cid:1) LPA 2 , whereas DGPP 8 : 0 preferentially inhib - ited the LPA 3 - induced actions . Ki16425 inhibited LPA - induced guanosine 5 (cid:2) - O - ( 3 - thio ) triphosphate binding as well as LPA receptor binding to membrane fractions with a same pharma - cological specificity as in intact cells . The difference in the inhibition profile of Ki16425 and DGPP 8 : 0 was exploited for the evaluation of receptor subtypes involved in responses to LPA in A431 cells . Finally , Ki16425 also inhibited LPA - induced long - term responses , including DNA synthesis and cell migration . In conclusion , Ki16425 selectively inhibits LPA receptor - mediated actions , especially through LPA 1 and LPA 3 ; therefore , it may be useful in evaluating the role of LPA and its receptor subtypes involved in biological actions . Lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) has been shown to elicit di - verse biological actions , including Ca 2 (cid:3) mobilization , change in cAMP accumulation , change in cell shape and motility in association with actin rearrangement , and proliferation in a variety of cell types ( Moolenaar , 1999 ; Contos et al . , 2000 ; Ye et al . , 2002 ) . Extracellular LPA has also been shown to be involved in certain diseases , such as atherosclerosis and can - cer ( Xu et al . , 1995 , 2001 ; Siess et al . , 1999 ; Maschberger et al . , 2000 ) . LPA was first thought to be released from acti - vated platelets ; however , a major part of extracellular LPA has been shown to be produced from lysophosphatidylcholine by lysophospholipase D , which was previously called auto - taxin ( Sano et al . , 2002 ; Tokumura et al . , 2002 ; Umezu - Goto et al . , 2002 ) . The concentration of plasma LPA is about 100 nM , and its serum concentration can be as high as 5 (cid:2) M ( Sano et al . , 2002 ) . LPA increases low - density lipoprotein during its oxidation , activates endothelial cells ( Siess et al . , This work was supported in part by a research grant grants - in - aid for scientific research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and by research grants from The Mitsubishi Foundation , Pusan National University and Yamanouchi Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders .

These cellular responses to LPA are mediated through G - protein - coupled receptors , and several subtypes of LPA receptors , including LPA 1 / EDG - 2 , LPA 2 / EDG - 4 , LPA 3 / EDG - 7 , and LPA 4 / GPR23 , a non - EDG - family LPA receptor , have been identified ( Hecht et al . , 1996 ; An et al . , 1998a , b ; Bandoh et al . , 1999 ; Moolenaar , 1999 ; Contos et al . , 2000 ; Im et al . , 2000 ; Ye et al . , 2002 ; Noguchi et al . , 2003 ) , although a novel intracellular mechanism through peroxi - some proliferator - activated receptor (cid:3) was recently demon - strated ( McIntyre et al . , 2003 ) . These LPA receptor subtypes are expressed and function in a variety of cell types ; however , the precise role of each LPA receptor subtype has not yet been fully characterized . Receptor antagonists are very useful tools for evaluating the role of LPA and its receptors in biological actions and for controlling specific diseases ( Tigyi , 2001 ) . Based on their ability to inhibit Ca 2 (cid:3) response to LPA in A431 cells or LPA - responsive cells , we have screened 150 , 000 low - molecu - lar - weight compounds developed by the Kirin Brewery Co . Ltd , for LPA receptor antagonists , and found that some isox - azole derivatives showed such an inhibitory activity against the LPA action . We therefore synthesized several isoxazole derivatives and finally selected Ki16425 as the best candi - date compound ( Ueno et al . , 2001 ) . In the present study , we examined the pharmacological properties of Ki16425 and compared it with that of DGPP 8 : 0 , a recently identified LPA antagonist ( Fischer et al . , 2001 ) . We found that Ki16425 inhibited LPA - induced actions in a manner highly specific to LPA and LPA receptor subtypes . Such differences in the selectivity of Ki16425 and DGPP 8 : 0 were successfully ap - plied to discriminate the receptor subtypes in A431 cells . Thus , the novel antagonist Ki16425 seems to be a useful tool for investigating physiological and pathophysiological roles of LPA and its receptors .

( Takasaki , Japan ) , and its chem - ical structure is shown in Fig . 1 . Preparation of LPA Receptor cDNA Plasmids and Expres - sion . The entire coding regions of LPA 1 ( 1 , 095 bp , GenBank acces - sion number Y09479 ) , LPA 2 ( 1 , 149 bp , GenBank accession number AF011466 ) , and LPA 3 ( 1 , 148 bp , GenBank accession number AF127138 ) were amplified from human cDNA library by RT - PCR . The respective amplified fragment was subcloned into the Eco RI site of pEFneo eukaryotic expression vector ( Kon et al . , 1999 ; Sato et al . , 2000 ) , and each DNA sequence was confirmed . The primers used for the RT - PCR were as follows . The 5 (cid:2) primers contained an Eco RI site , a Kozak sequence ( CCACC ) , and the N - terminal region of the respec - tive receptor . The 3 (cid:2) - primers contained an Eco RI site and a stop codon in addition to the C - terminal region of the respective receptor . CHO cells or RH7777 cells were transfected with pEFneo empty vector alone or the pEFneo vector containing human LPA 1 , human LPA 2 , or human LPA 3 by electroporation , and the neomycin - resis - tant cells ( G418 sulfate at 1 mg / ml for CHO cells and 0 . 3 mg / ml for RH7777 cells ) were selected . CHO cells resistant to G - 418 were used in bulk , whereas RH7777 cells expressing the different LPA receptor subtypes were cloned by limiting dilution . Subsequently , clonal RH7777 cells expressing human LPA 2 ( C3 ) and human LPA 3 ( C5 ) were isolated . However , in the early stages of the experiments , we were unable to obtain stable human LPA 1 RH7777 cells ; therefore , we used a stable mouse LPA 1 - expressing clone of RH7777 cells , which was provided by Prof . Kevin R . Lynch of the University of Virginia School of Medicine ( Im et al . , 2000 ) . Human LPA 1 cDNA was also subcloned into the Hin dIII / Bam HI site of pcDNA3 . Human and mouse orthologs of LPA 1 subcloned into pcDNA3 vector ( Im et al . , 2000 ) , provided by Prof . Kevin R . Lynch , were transfected into HEK293T cells . Cell Culture . THP - 1 , HL - 60 , and A431 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ( Sigma ) ( Oka - jima and Kondo , 1995 ) ; Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts , S1P receptor - trans - fected CHO cells ( Kon et al . , 1999 ) , and LPA receptor - transfected CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ; and LPA receptor - transfected RH7777 cells and HEK293T cells were cultured in minimum essen - tial medium supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS . FRTL - 5 thyroid cells and PC - 12 cells were cultured as described previously ( Sho et al . , Fig . 1 . Chemical structure of Ki16425 . TABLE 1 K i values of Ki16425 The K i values were estimated from inositol phosphate response shown in Fig . 2 ( left column ) or from the GTP (cid:3) S binding assay shown in Fig . 3 ( right column ) , in a manner similar to that for the inositol phosphate response for LPA 2 and based on the Schild regressions for other receptor subtypes .

For cAMP assay , RH7777 cells were plated to dishes coated with rat tail collagen ( 400 (cid:2) g / ml ) . Twenty - four hours before experiments , the medium was replaced with serum - free me - dium as specified containing 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) BSA ( fraction V ) . In the case of the inositol phosphate response , the medium was changed to TCM199 medium containing 20 (cid:2) Ci of [ 3 H ] inositol ( in 6 ml ) and 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) BSA ( fraction V ) . Where indicated , PTX ( 100 ng / ml ) or its vehicle ( final 2 mM urea ) was added to the culture medium 24 h before experiments . As for GTP (cid:3) 35 S binding and [ 3 H ] LPA binding assays , each recep - tor plasmid DNA ( 6 (cid:2) g ) encoding mouse LPA 1 , human LPA 1 , human LPA 2 , or human LPA 3 was mixed with plasmids encoding the C352G rat mutant of G i 2 (cid:4) ( 6 (cid:2) g ) , bovine (cid:5) 1 ( 6 (cid:2) g ) , and (cid:3) 2 subunits ( 6 (cid:2) g ) ( Tomura et al . , 1997 ) , and transfected into HEK293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitate method ( Im et al . , 2000 ) . After 24 h , the medium was changed to fresh minimum essential medium sup - plemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS and cells were cultured for an addi - tional 24 h . The cells were maintained for about 6 h in thefresh medium ( without serum ) containing 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) BSA ( fraction V ) , and membranes were prepared as described previously ( Kon et al . , 1999 ) . Measurements of [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] i . THP - 1 and HL - 60 cells were har - vested by centrifugation ( 250 g ) . RH7777 cells transfected with LPA receptors were washed with Ca 2 (cid:3) - and Mg 2 (cid:3) - free phosphate - buff - ered saline containing 4 mM EGTA at 37°C for (cid:4) 5 to 10 min and then harvested . Other cells were harvested with trypsin ( 0 . 05 % ) after washing with Ca 2 (cid:3) - and Mg 2 (cid:3) - free phosphate - buffered saline containing 4 mM EGTA . The cells were centrifuged at 250 g , and pelleted cells were resuspended in Ham’s 10 medium containing 0 . 1 % BSA and incubated with 1 (cid:2) M Fura 2 / AM for 20 min . The cells were washed twice and resuspended in the HEPES - buffered me - dium . The HEPES - buffered medium was composed of 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 134 mM NaCl , 4 . 7 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 2 mM MgSO 4 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 . 5 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM glucose , and 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) BSA ( fraction V ) . [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i was estimated from the change in the fluorescence of the Fura 2 - loaded cells , as described previously ( Oka - jima et al . , 1998 ; Kon et al . , 1999 ) . Unless otherwise stated , the cells were incubated for 1 min in the presence or absence of Ki16425 or DGPP 8 : 0 , and indicated agonists were added to the incubation medium to monitor [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i . The net [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i change ( peak value (cid:5) basal value ) at around 15 s was calculated . Inositol Phosphate Production . Assays were performed essen - tially as described previously ( Murata et al . , 2000 ) . The cells were incubated for 1 min with or without test agents , and the inositol phosphates ( sum of inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate ) were measured . The results were normalized to 10 5 dpm of the total radioactivity incorporated into the cellular inositol lipids , and the radioactivity of trichloroacetic acid ( 5 % ) - insoluble fraction was con - sidered as the total radioactivity . cAMP Accumulation . The cells were washed once and preincu - bated for 10 min at 37°C in HEPES - buffered medium . FRTL - 5 thy - roid cells were incubated with LPA or other agonists in the presence or absence of Ki16425 . Forskolin ( 10 (cid:2) M ) , 100 (cid:2) M Ro20 - 1724 , and 0 . 5 units / ml adenosine deaminase were added to the medium . S1P 1 - transfected CHO cells were similarly incubated with test agents . In this case , the incubation medium contained 10 (cid:2) M forskolin and 0 . 5 mM 3 - isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine . After a 10 - min incubation , the reaction was terminated by adding 100 (cid:2) l of 1 N HCl , and cyclic AMP was measured as described previously ( Sho et al . , 1991 ) . GTP (cid:2) 35 S Binding . Binding assay was performed by incubating the membranes with 0 . 1 nM GTP (cid:3) 35 S ( (cid:4) 2 (cid:6) 10 5 dpm / ml ) for 30 min at 30°C , as described previously ( Im et al . , 2000 ) . [ 3 H ] LPA Binding . Membrane protein ( 40 (cid:2) g ) was incubated in 0 . 4 ml of the binding buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 5 ) containing 25 (cid:2) g / ml of saponin , 0 . 05 % BSA , 0 . 5 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 5 nM [ 3 H ] LPA ( 48 Ci / mmol ) , and different concentrations of Ki16425 and LPA for 60 min at 4°C . The reaction was terminated and binding activity was measured as for GTP (cid:3) 35 S binding assay . Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 (cid:2) M unla - beled LPA . RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis . Total RNA was prepared from the cells using TRIzol ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Total RNA ( 20 (cid:2) g ) was electrophoresed in a 1 % agarose gel containing 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in 20 mM MOPS buffer , and blotted to a nylon membrane ( Hybond - N ) with 20 (cid:6) standard saline citrate . The probes ( 20 ng ) were labeled with [ (cid:4) - 32 P ] dATP by random oligonucleotide priming and added to the blots at a concentration of about 5 (cid:6) 10 6 dpm in 5 ml of hybrid - ization buffer . The hybridization was carried out at 60°C . After hybridization , the blots were washed at 60°C with 0 . 2 (cid:6) standard saline citrate and 0 . 1 % SDS , as described previously ( Sato et al . , 1999 ) . RT - PCR Analysis . Single - strand DNA was synthesized using the SUPERSCRIPT II kit ( Invitrogen ) . To ensure that no genomic DNA contamination was present , the reaction was performed in parallel without reverse transcriptase . The product was then subjected to amplification by PCR . Degenerate DNA primers were based on the cDNA sequences of the human LPA 1 ( GenBank accession number Y09479 ) , human LPA 2 ( GenBank accession number AF011466 ) , and TABLE 2 Correlation of LPA receptor mRNA expression and Ki16425 inhibition of Ca 2 (cid:3) responses to LPA and other agonists in different cell types Effects of Ki16425 on (cid:7) Ca 2 (cid:3) (cid:8) i increase induced by LPA and other receptor agonists in various cell types , including THP - 1 cells , 3T3 fibroblasts , A431 cells , PC - 12 cells , and HL - 60 cells . These cells were incubated in the presence or absence of Ki16425 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) . LPA receptor expression was assessed from Northern blotting and PCR meth - ods shown in Fig . 8 .

The prim - ers for LPA 4 were synthesized according to the cDNA sequence of the human GRP23 ( GenBank accession number NM005296 ) . The primers used were : LPA 1 : forward , 5 (cid:2) - 682 ATCTTTGGCTATGTTCGCCA 701 - 3 (cid:2) ; reverse , 5 (cid:2) - 1076 TTGCTGTGAACTCCAGCCA 1058 - 3 ; LPA 2 , forward , 5 (cid:2) - 248 TGGCCTACCTCTTCCTCATGTTCCA 272 - 3 (cid:2) ; reverse , 5 (cid:2) - 716 AGGCT - GAGCGTGGTCTCTCGGTAGC 692 - 3 (cid:2) ; LPA 3 : forward , 5 (cid:2) - 51 AGTGT - CACTATGACAAGC 67 - 3 (cid:2) ; reverse , 5 (cid:2) - 563 GAGATGTTGCAGAGGC 548 - 3 (cid:2) ; and LPA 4 : forward , 5 (cid:2) - 567 TGAAGGCTTCTCCAAACGTGTCTG 590 - 3 (cid:2) ; reverse , 5 (cid:2) - 909 GTTCAGAGTTGCAAGGCACAAGGT 886 - 3 (cid:2) . The primer sequences in these regions were identical for the human and mouse , except for the reverse primer of mouse LPA 2 , which was 5 (cid:2) - AGGCTGAG T GTGGTCTCTCGGTAGC - 3 (cid:2) . Primers for the human or - thologs were effective for amplification of mouse ( 3T3 fibroblasts ) and rat ( PC - 12 cells ) LPA 2 cDNA . Each PCR was carried out using 2 . 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase and 1 (cid:2) l of reverse transcriptase reaction product in a 50 - (cid:2) l reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 200 (cid:2) M dNTP , and 10 pmol of each primer . An extended denaturation at 94°C for 3 min was followed by 30 cycles , consisting of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s , annealing at 50°C ( LPA 1 ) , 50°C ( LPA 2 ) , 47°C ( LPA 3 ) , and 52°C ( LPA 4 ) for 30 s , and elongation at 72°C for 1 min . After final extension at 72°C for 10 min , the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis . DNA Synthesis . Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were pretreated for 10 min with Ki16425 in fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium contain - ing 0 . 1 % BSA and then cultured for 20 h with LPA , S1P , or PDGF , and with [ 3 H ] thymidine ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) Ci in 1 ml ) for another 4 h . The radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid - insoluble fraction was measured as described previously ( Kimura et al . , 2000 ) . Cell Migration . The migration experiment was performed using a Boyden chamber apparatus ( Neuro Probe Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) as described previously ( Tamama et al . , 2001 ) . Cells remaining on the upper surface of the filters were removed , and the filters were then fixed in methanol and stained with Diff - Quik Solution II ( In - ternational Reagents Corp . , Kobe , Japan ) . The number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface was determined by counting the cells in four microscopic fields at 400 (cid:6) magnification . Calculation of K i Value . The K i values for Ki16425 or DGPP 8 : 0 were estimated from inositol phosphate responses or Ca 2 (cid:3) responses , based on the following equation : K i (cid:10) ( EC 50 (cid:6) B ) / ( EC 50 (cid:2) (cid:5) EC 50 ) , where B is the concentration of Ki16425 or DGPP 8 : 0 , and EC 50 and EC 50 (cid:2) are the half - maximal effective concentration of LPA in the absence and presence of the antagonist , respectively . The half - max - imal effective concentration was estimated as a value that graphi - cally gives a 50 % maximal response , unless otherwise specified . With regard to the Schild regressions , the half - maximal effective concen - tration was estimated from the Scatchard plots . The K i value was determined by plotting the log of Dose Ratio - 1 at each concentration of Ki16425 against the log concentration of Ki16425 . The x - intercept of the linear transformation equals the inverse log of the K i . Statistical Analysis . All experiments were performed in dupli - cate or triplicate , and the results of multiple observations were presented as means (cid:9) S . E . of at least three independent experi - ments , unless otherwise stated . Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s t test and values were considered significant at p (cid:11) 0 . 05 . Results Pharmacological Characterization of Ki16425 . From 150 , 000 low - molecular weight compounds screened for selec - tive antagonist action on LPA receptors , Ki16425 was iden - tified as the best candidate ( Fig . 1 ) . When we started this study , EDG - family LPA receptors , but not LPA 4 / GPR23 , had been identified . To study pharmacological characteristics of the compound , EDG - family LPA receptor subtypes were transfected into RH7777 cells , which have previously been shown to express none of these LPA receptors in a detectable level ( Im et al . , 2000 ) . No significant increase in [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i , increase in inositol phosphate production , or inhibition of cAMP accumulation in response to LPA could be found in wild - type or vector - transfected RH7777 cells ( data not shown ) . LPA induced inositol phosphate production in a dose - dependent manner with different efficacy and potency in cells transfected with the different receptor subtypes . In the case of LPA 1 and LPA 3 , 1 (cid:2) M Ki16425 treatment slightly but significantly suppressed the LPA action , and the inhibi - tory effect became pronounced at 10 (cid:2) M . On the other hand , the inhibitory effect of 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 in LPA 2 - expressing cells was marginal , although significant , in the (cid:4) 0 . 1 to 1 (cid:2) M concentration range of LPA . In all cases , Ki16425 showed a Fig . 2 . LPA receptor subtype selectivity of Ki16425 . The production of inositol phosphate ( IP ) by indicated concentrations of LPA was measured in the presence ( Œ , 1 (cid:2) M ; F , 10 (cid:2) M ) or absence ( E ) of Ki16425 in RH7777 cells expressing LPA 1 ( A ) , LPA 2 ( B ) , or LPA 3 ( C ) . The results are ex - pressed as percentages of the maximal response to 10 (cid:2) M LPA in the absence of Ki16425 . The basal activity and the activity at 10 (cid:2) M LPA were 553 (cid:9) 47 and 1 , 547 (cid:9) 84 dpm for LPA 1 cells , 527 (cid:9) 43 and 2 , 560 (cid:9) 39 dpm for LPA 2 cells , and 743 (cid:9) 120 and 2 , 813 (cid:9) 130 dpm for LPA 3 cells , respectively . Ki16425 did not significantly change the basal activity . * , the effect of Ki16425 was significant .

A similar selectivity of Ki16425 was observed to the Ca 2 (cid:3) responses in RH7777 cells express - ing the different receptor subtypes ( data not shown ) . To further characterize the actions of Ki16425 , we per - formed GTP (cid:3) S binding assays in membranes prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the LPA receptors and G - protein subunits . In this experiment , we also compared the effects of Ki16425 on the mouse and human orthologs of LPA 1 . As shown in Fig . 3 , LPA receptor trans - fection introduced an increase in GTP (cid:3) S binding activity in response to LPA . Consistent with a previous study ( Im et al . , 2000 ) , the potency of LPA was slightly lower for LPA 3 than for LPA 1 or LPA 2 . Ki16425 competitively inhibited the LPA - induced action with different potencies , depending on the LPA receptor subtype , and K i values were calculated from Schild regressions and presented in Table 1 . These values were similar to those estimated from the inositol phosphate response in intact RH7777 cells ; the small difference proba - bly reflects the differences in assay conditions , including temperature , reaction time , and cell type used . Thus , Ki16425 was more effective in the membranes that expressed LPA 1 and LPA 3 than in those that expressed LPA 2 . There was no detectable difference between mouse and human LPA 1 orthologs in their sensitivity to Ki16425 ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Next , we examined the effect of Ki16425 on LPA receptor ligand binding . Because of the high nonspecific binding to the membranes and uncharacterized ( specific ) binding of LPA , even in vector - transfected cell membranes , we were unable to obtain saturation curves for LPA binding . Nevertheless , spe - cific LPA binding at 5 nM was increased after transfection of LPA 1 or LPA 2 ( Fig . 4A ) , but not of LPA 3 transfection ( see legend to Fig . 4 ) . Ki16425 at 10 (cid:2) M clearly inhibited the LPA - specific binding in LPA 1 - expressing cell membranes and slightly inhibited it in LPA 2 - expressing cell membrane , whereas there was no detectable effect in membranes from vector - transfected cells ( Fig . 4A ) . We tentatively attributed the increment in specific binding resulting from the receptor transfection to LPA receptor - dependent binding activity . The dose - dependent effect of Ki16425 on LPA receptor - dependent binding is shown in Fig . 4B . Ki16425 was 20 to 30 times more potent for LPA 1 than for LPA 2 , and the K i values were estimated to be 0 . 67 (cid:2) M for LPA 1 and 21 . 4 (cid:2) M for LPA 2 , which were close to those estimated from the inositol phos - phate responses and GTP (cid:3) S binding ( Table 1 ) . In summary , Kil6425 preferentially inhibited LPA 1 - and LPA 3 - mediated responses but had only a moderate effect on LPA 2 . Ki16425 Inhibition Is Selective for LPA Receptors . To investigate the compound’s specificity and usefulness as an antagonist of LPA receptor , we applied Ki16425 to a variety of cell types and measured several cellular responses ( Table 2 and Figs . 5 – 7 ) . The dose - dependent [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i increase elic - ited by LPA in THP - 1 cells ( Fig . 5A ) and in 3T3 fibroblasts ( Fig . 5B ) was inhibited by Ki16425 in a competitive manner : the K i value was estimated to be 0 . 17 (cid:2) M in THP - 1 and 0 . 54 (cid:2) M in 3T3 fibroblasts . Likewise , in A431 cells , the LPA response was markedly inhibited by Ki16425 ( Table 2 ) . Thus , Ki16425 is a potent and reversible antagonist ( Fig . 5C ) . In Fig . 3 . LPA - induced GTP (cid:3) S binding to cell membranes expressing different LPA receptors . Crude membranes were prepared from HEK293T cells that were transfected with mouse ( m ) LPA 1 ( A ) , human ( h ) LPA 1 ( B ) , hLPA 2 ( C ) , or hLPA 3 ( D ) together with cDNAs encod - ing (cid:4) - , (cid:5) - , and (cid:3) - subunits of G - proteins . The GTP (cid:3) S binding activity by indi - cated concentrations of LPA was mea - sured in the presence ( (cid:4) , 0 . 1 (cid:2) M ; (cid:1) , 0 . 3 (cid:2) M ; Œ , 1 (cid:2) M ; f , 3 (cid:2) M ; F , 10 (cid:2) M ) or absence ( E ) of Ki16425 . Transfection of LPA receptors increased the basal ac - tivity in the absence of LPA from ap - proximately 2 , 000 dpm to 3 , 000 ( LPA 2 and LPA 3 ) (cid:4) 4 , 000 dpm ( any LPA 1 ) . This activity was increased to about 3 , 000 ( vector ) , 8 , 000 ( LPA 2 and LPA 3 ) , and 11 , 000 dpm ( any LPA 1 ) by 10 (cid:2) M LPA . Ki16425 treatment decreased the basal activity in the absence of LPA to about 1 , 500 dpm in all cases regardless of the receptor transfection . Thus , Ki16425 seems to inhibit the basal activity with - out LPA receptor stimulation . LPA - in - duced activities in the absence or pres - ence of indicated concentrations of Ki16425 are expressed as percentages of the response to 10 (cid:2) M LPA in the absence of Ki16425 . Schild analysis was performed , as shown in the inset , and the estimated K i values are shown in Table 1 . 998 Ohta et al . a t A SP ET J ou r n a l s on J un e 21 , 2017 m o l ph a r m . a s p e tj ou r n a l s . o r g D o w n l o a d e d fr o m this experiment , 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with or with - out 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 for the last 1 or 10 min during labeling time with Fura2 / AM , the cells were washed with fresh me - dium three times , and the Ca 2 (cid:3) response to LPA was mea - Fig . 4 . Effect of Ki16425 on LPA receptor binding . A , effect of receptor transfection on the LPA - specific binding . The same HEK293T cell mem - branes as those in Fig . 3 were used . The membranes from the cells that were transfected with mLPA 1 or hLPA 2 were incubated with 5 nM [ 3 H ] LPA . LPA - specific binding without ( control ) or with 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 was measured by subtracting the nonspecific binding activity ( 6 , 000 dpm ) ; this value remained unchanged by receptor transfection . The spe - cific binding was increased by the transfection of LPA 1 or LPA 2 ( Fig . 4A ) but not by the transfection of LPA 3 , possibly because of the lower potency of LPA in LPA 3 - expressing cell membranes . The results are shown as LPA specific binding (cid:9) S . E . B ; the increase in the binding activity caused by receptor transfection was attributed to an LPA receptor - dependent binding activity , and the effect of Ki16425 is expressed as a percentage of this activity . From the LPA receptor binding data , the K i value can be theoretically estimated from the following equation : K i (cid:10) ( IC 50 (cid:6) K ) / ( K (cid:3) A ) , where A is the concentration of [ 3 H ] LPA used for the binding exper - iment ( 5 nM ) , IC 50 is the half - maximal inhibitory concentration of Ki16425 ( 0 . 72 (cid:2) M for LPA 1 and 22 (cid:2) M for LPA 2 , estimated from Fig . 4B ) , and K is the dissociation constant of LPA for the receptor . However , an accurate K value could not be determined ( see text ) . Instead , we used an EC 50 value of LPA for GTP (cid:3) S binding ( 72 nM for LPA 1 and 148 nM for LPA 2 , estimated from Fig . 3 ) as the K value and K i values were estimated to be 0 . 67 and 21 . 3 (cid:2) M for mouse LPA 1 and human LPA 2 , respectively . * , the effect of Ki16425 was significant in A and the activity was significant between LPA 1 and LPA 2 in B . Fig . 5 . Effect of Ki16425 on [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i increase induced by LPA in THP - 1 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts . Ca 2 (cid:3) response to indicated concentrations of LPA was measured in the presence ( Œ ) or absence ( E ) of Ki16425 ( 1 (cid:2) M ) in THP - 1 cells in ( A ) and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ( B ) . The results are expressed as percentages of the maximal [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i increase ( 404 (cid:9) 27 nM in THP - 1 cells and 1 , 256 (cid:9) 87 nM in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ) by 10 (cid:2) M LPA in the absence of Ki16425 . Inset , Ca 2 (cid:3) response to 100 nM LPA was measured in the presence of indicated concentrations of Ki16425 . The results are expressed as percentages of the [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i increase ( 217 (cid:9) 36 nM in THP - 1 cells and 759 (cid:9) 73 nM in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ) by 100 nM LPA in the absence of Ki16425 . C , the reversibility of the Ki16425 effect was examined in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts . The cells were incubated for 1 or 10 min with or without 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 during labeling time with Fura 2 / AM and washed three times with the HEPES - buffered medium . The [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i increase by 100 nM LPA was then examined after the 1 - or 10 - min preincubation with or without 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 .

There was no significant effect of the pretreatment with Ki16425 on the LPA action , indicating that the compound could be washed out without leaving residual inhibition . In PC - 12 cells , Ki16425 had only a small , although signif - icant , inhibitory effect on the Ca 2 (cid:3) response to LPA . In HL - 60 cells , a small but significant [ Ca 2 (cid:3) ] i increase by LPA was insensitive to Ki16425 ( Table 2 ) . Thus , Ki16425 inhib - ited the LPA - induced Ca 2 (cid:3) response in THP - 1 cells , 3T3 fibroblasts , and A431 cells , but had only a marginal effect in PC - 12 cells and HL - 60 cells . On the other hand , the Ca 2 (cid:3) responses to ATP , PAF , and SPC in THP - 1 cells , PDGF and S1P in 3T3 fibroblasts , EGF and PAF in A431 cells , and SPC , lysophosphatidylcholine , psychosine , and 2 - arachidonoylg - lycerol in HL - 60 cells were not significantly inhibited by Ki16425 ( Table 2 ) . Figure 6 shows the effect of Ki16425 on the inositol phos - phate response . This LPA - induced response in 3T3 fibro - blasts ( Fig . 6A ) and A431 cells ( Fig . 6C ) was inhibited by Ki16425 , and the mode of Ki16425 inhibition was consistent with competitive inhibition in 3T3 fibroblasts ( the K i value was 0 . 68 (cid:2) M ) . In contrast , the responses to S1P in 3T3 fibroblasts ( Fig . 6A , right ) , S1P 3 - expressing CHO cells , and S1P 2 - expressing CHO cells ( Fig . 6B ) were insensitive to Ki16425 . Similarly , the response to PAF and bradykinin was not significantly affected by the inhibitor ( Fig . 6C ) . Figure 7 shows the effects of Ki16425 on the inhibition of the forskolin - induced cAMP accumulation in response to LPA and phenylisopropyladenosine , an A 1 adenosine recep - tor agonist , and S1P . LPA inhibited cAMP accumulation in FRTL - 5 thyroid cells in a PTX - sensitive manner ( Fig . 7A ) , suggesting a G i - mediated inhibition of the LPA action . This inhibition by LPA was significantly suppressed by Ki16425 even at 0 . 1 (cid:2) M and almost completely at 10 (cid:2) M . However , the phenylisopropyladenosine - induced inhibition was insen - sitive to even 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 , although the inhibition was PTX - sensitive in the same cells ( Fig . 7B ) , thus ruling out the possibility that Ki16425 might act on G i - proteins . Likewise , the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by S1P in S1P 1 - express - ing CHO cells was hardly affected by Ki16425 ( Fig . 7C ) , and Fig . 6 . Effects of Ki16425 on inositol phosphate production . Inositol phosphate response to indicated concentrations of agents was measured in 3T3 fibroblasts ( A ) , S1P 3 - or S1P 2 - expressing CHO cells ( B ) in the presence ( F ) or absence ( E ) of Ki16425 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) . A , results are expressed as percentages of the respective maximal response to 10 (cid:2) M LPA or S1P in the absence of Ki16425 . The maximal response was obtained by sub - tracting the basal activity ( 1 , 245 (cid:9) 127 dpm ) from the maximal activity ( 2 , 258 (cid:9) 240 dpm by 10 (cid:2) M LPA and 2 , 901 (cid:9) 100 dpm by 10 (cid:2) M S1P ) . B , the maximal response was evaluated in a manner similar to that described in A ; the activity was changed from 678 (cid:9) 57 to 4 , 206 (cid:9) 214 dpm by 1 (cid:2) M S1P ( left ) and from 631 (cid:9) 16 to 1 , 382 (cid:9) 10 dpm by 10 (cid:2) M S1P ( right ) . C , inositol phosphate response to indicated concentrations of LPA , PAF , or bradykinin ( BK ) in the presence or absence of Ki16425 ( 1 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) M ) was measured in A431 cells . Results are expressed as the net increase in the activity by the respective agent . The basal value without agonist was 1 , 093 (cid:9) 12 dpm and was not appreciably changed by Ki16425 treatment . Fig . 7 . Effect of Ki16425 on cAMP response . FRTL - 5 cells ( A and B ) , treated or not treated with PTX , or S1P 1 - expressing CHO cells ( C ) were incubated with indicated concentrations of LPA , phenylisopropylad - enosine ( PIA ) , or S1P in the presence or absence of Ki16425 . The results are expressed as percentages of the value obtained without these ago - nists . These values were 41 . 6 (cid:9) 3 . 6 nmol / 10 mg of protein for FRTL - 5 cells and 6 . 36 (cid:9) 0 . 38 nmol / 10 mg of protein for S1P 1 / CHO cells . These values were not appreciably affected by PTX or Ki16425 treatment . 1000 Ohta et al . a t A SP ET J ou r n a l s on J un e 21 , 2017 m o l ph a r m . a s p e tj ou r n a l s . o r g D o w n l o a d e d fr o m this S1P action was also reversed by PTX treatment ( data not shown ) . In summary , Ki16425 was found to specifically inhibit LPA - induced response without any appreciable effect on re - sponses to other receptor agonists . However , the extent of the LPA - induced inhibition seemed to depend on the cell types ; the inhibition was marginal in PC - 12 cells and undetectable in HL - 60 cells . Differential Expression of LPA Receptor Subtypes May Explain the Susceptibility to Ki16425 . mRNA ex - pression of LPA receptor subtypes in the cells used ( Figs . 5 – 7 ) was examined by Northern blotting and RT - PCR meth - ods . Some of the results are summarized in Table 2 . As seen in Fig . 8 , A431 cells express all subtypes of EDG - family LPA receptor mRNAs but not LPA 4 / GPR23 mRNA ; 3T3 fibro - blasts and THP - 1 cells express LPA 1 , LPA 2 , and LPA 4 mR - NAs ; HL - 60 cells express LPA 2 and LPA 4 mRNAs ; FRTL - 5 cells express LPA 1 mRNA as a major band ; and PC - 12 cells express LPA 2 mRNA as a major band . Although the size of LPA 2 mRNA differed among the cell types , as shown by Northern blotting ( Fig . 8A ) , a single band with a similar size was amplified by RT - PCR ( Fig . 8B ) . This suggests the heter - ogeneity of LPA 2 mRNA , possibly because of alternative splicing ( An et al . , 1998a , b ) . In the case of LPA 3 , a trace band with almost the same size as the band in A431 cells was detected in HL - 60 and THP - 1 cells by Northern blotting ( Fig . 8A ) ; however , no specific band was amplified by RT - PCR . Thus , the expression of LPA 3 mRNA in HL - 60 and THP - 1 cells could not be confirmed . LPA 1 mRNA was detected in Ki16425 - sensitive A431 cells , FRTL - 5 cells , 3T3 fibroblasts , and THP - 1 cells . On the other hand , LPA 2 and / or LPA 4 were detected in Ki16425 - insensitive or less - sensitive HL - 60 cells Fig . 8 . Northern blot ( A ) and RT - PCR ( B ) analyses of LPA receptor mRNAs in various cell types . As a positive control for LPA 4 / GPR23 , rat ovary was used . It should be noted that even though the size of LPA 2 mRNA determined by Northern blotting differed among cell types , a single band with a similar size was amplified by RT - PCR analysis for LPA 2 . Fig . 9 . Effects of Ki16425 on DNA synthesis and migration of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts . A , the cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of agonists in the presence or absence of Ki16425 ( 1 (cid:2) M ) . The net increase in thymidine incorporation by the respective agonist is shown . The basal activity without agonists was 89 , 000 (cid:9) 1 , 500 dpm in the absence of Ki16425 and 60 , 000 (cid:9) 8 , 000 dpm in the presence of 1 (cid:2) M Ki16425 . B , the cells were incubated with 10 (cid:2) M LPA , 10 (cid:2) M S1P , or 400 pM PDGF in the presence of the indicated concentration of Ki16425 . The results are ex - pressed as percentages of the net activity induced by the respective agonist as shown in A . C and D , the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of Ki16425 and loaded into the upper wells of the Boyden chamber , and then cell migration for 4 h was measured . The lower wells were filled with the indicated concentrations of LPA or PDGF . The number of cells that migrated into the lower surface of the membrane filter was counted .

Thus , cell sensitivity to Ki16425 seems to reflect the differential expression of LPA receptor subtypes , especially LPA 1 , and Ki16425 seems to be a useful tool for evaluating the involve - ment of specific LPA receptors in the short - term response to LPA . Ki16425 Inhibits Long - Term DNA Synthesis and Cell Migration As Induced by LPA . We next examined whether Ki16425 was applicable for inhibiting long - term re - sponses including DNA synthesis ( 24 h ) and cell migration ( 4 h ) . As shown in Fig . 9A , the LPA - induced DNA synthesis in 3T3 fibroblasts was markedly inhibited by 1 (cid:2) M Ki16425 , but those induced by S1P and PDGF were not appreciably af - fected at this concentration of the compound . Significant inhibition of the LPA - induced action by Ki16425 was ob - served at (cid:4) 0 . 01 to 0 . 1 (cid:2) M , but DNA synthesis induced by S1P or PDGF was not affected even at 3 (cid:2) M ( Fig . 9B ) . LPA maximally stimulated the migration of 3T3 fibroblasts at 100 nM , and the activity declined as the LPA concentration in - creased . The bell - shaped migration response to LPA was also observed in glioma cells ( Manning et al . , 2000 ) and lympho - cytes ( Zheng et al . , 2001 ) , although the mechanism has not yet been well characterized . One possible mechanism might be desensitization caused by high agonist concentration . Ki16425 at (cid:4) 0 . 1 to 1 (cid:2) M significantly inhibited the peak migration activity ( Fig . 9C ) , but PDGF - induced cell migra - tion was not inhibited under these conditions ( Fig . 9D ) , sim - ilar to the case of DNA synthesis ( Fig . 9B ) .

The results are expressed as percentages of the value obtained at 10 (cid:2) M LPA in the absence of Ki16425 . The 100 % values were 511 (cid:9) 4 nM for LPA 1 - expressing cells , 688 (cid:9) 40 nM for LPA 2 - expressing cells , and 908 (cid:9) 38 nM for LPA 3 - expressing cells . Fig . 11 . Evaluation of the subtype of LPA receptors involved in inositol phosphate response in A431 cells . A , the effect of PTX on the LPA - induced action . Normal A431 cells not treated with PTX or A431 cells treated with the toxin were incubated with the indicated concentrations of LPA . The results are expressed as the net production of inositol phosphate by LPA . The basal activity was 1 , 163 (cid:9) 53 dpm for control cells and 1 , 174 (cid:9) 58 dpm for PTX - treated cells . B , normal cells ; C , PTX - treated cells . The LPA - induced activity was measured in the absence or presence of 1 (cid:2) M Ki16425 , 10 (cid:2) M Ki16425 , or 30 (cid:2) M DGPP 8 : 0 . The results are expressed as percentages of the response at 10 (cid:2) M LPA in the normal or PTX - treated cells shown in A . 1002 Ohta et al . a t A SP ET J ou r n a l s on J un e 21 , 2017 m o l ph a r m . a s p e tj ou r n a l s . o r g D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ported as a selective antagonist of LPA 1 and LPA 3 ( Fischer et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , we attempted to confirm the pharma - cological specificity of DGPP 8 : 0 for LPA receptor subtypes . As shown in Fig . 10 , this compound clearly inhibited the LPA 3 - mediated Ca 2 (cid:3) response and slightly but significantly inhibited the LPA 1 - mediated one . The competitive inhibition by DGPP 8 : 0 was also observed for the inositol phosphate response in LPA 3 - expressing CHO cells ( data not shown ) . However , as originally proposed ( Fischer et al . , 2001 ) , this agent was ineffective for the LPA 2 - mediated Ca 2 (cid:3) response ( Fig . 10B ) and the inositol phosphate response ( data not shown ) . Based on the ability to inhibit Ca 2 (cid:3) response , the K i values of DGPP 8 : 0 were estimated to be 19 . 9 (cid:2) M for LPA 1 and 3 . 33 (cid:2) M for LPA 3 . Thus , DGPP 8 : 0 was more effective for LPA 3 than LPA 1 , whereas Ki16425 was slightly more effec - tive for LPA 1 than LPA 3 ( Table 1 ) . Finally , we explored the differences in the receptor selec - tivity of DGPP 8 : 0 and Ki16425 for the evaluation of the lipid receptor subtypes involved in the LPA response in A431 cells . A431 cells express three EDG - family LPA receptor subtypes but not LPA 4 ( Fig . 8 and Table 2 ) . As shown in Fig . 11A , LPA induced inositol phosphate production in a dose - dependent manner and was partially inhibited by PTX . When the effects of Ki16425 were compared in A431 cells ( Fig . 11B ) and PTX - treated cells ( Fig . 11C ) , 1 (cid:2) M Ki16425 was inhibitory at the lower concentrations ( (cid:4) 10 – 100 nM ) of LPA in normal cells ; the K i value was 0 . 73 (cid:2) M , which is comparable with that of the mean for LPA 1 or LPA 3 ( Table 1 ) . However , DGPP 8 : 0 was found to be ineffective ( Fig . 11B , right ) . These results suggest that the LPA - induced inositol phosphate response is predominantly mediated by LPA 1 in normal A431 cells . On the other hand , in the PTX - treated A431 cells , Ki16425 , even at 10 (cid:2) M , hardly affected the LPA - induced action ( Fig . 11C ) , suggesting that LPA 2 , but neither LPA 1 nor LPA 3 , might be a major receptor subtype in the PTX - treated A431 cells . Thus , in normal A431 cells , both LPA 1 as a major route and LPA 2 as a minor route may mediate the LPA - induced inositol phosphate response . Discussion In the present study , we showed that Ki16425 inhibited LPA - induced actions , including short - term ( (cid:4) 10 min ) ( i . e . , Ca 2 (cid:3) , inositol phosphate response , and cAMP responses ) and long - term responses ( (cid:4) 4 – 24 h ) ( i . e . , DNA synthesis and cell migration ) . Ki16425 did not exhibit any significant effects on the other receptor agonist - induced actions , including S1P , SPC , psychosine , 2 - arachidonoylglycerol , PAF , lysophos - phatidylcholine , ATP , A 1 - adenosine receptor agonist , brady - kinin , EGF , and PDGF . Among the EDG - family LPA receptor subtypes analyzed in the present study , Ki16425 preferen - tially inhibited LPA 1 - and LPA 3 - mediated actions but only weakly inhibited those mediated by LPA 2 . Because GPR23 was reported as a fourth LPA receptor during the review process of this article , it remains to be elucidated whether Ki16425 affects LPA 4 / GPR23 . The inhibition of the LPA - induced actions by Ki16425 showed a competitive pattern ; Ki16425 least inhibited LPA binding to LPA 1 but with a high potency , whereas to LPA 2 , it was inhibitory with a low po - tency , suggesting a competitive antagonist for LPA receptors with a preference for LPA 1 and LPA 3 over LPA 2 . Recent studies suggest that ligands loosely classified as antagonists can be divided into at least two classes : neutral antagonists , which possess no intrinsic activity , and inverse agonists , which possess negative intrinsic activity ( de Ligt et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , inverse agonists can inhibit the basal activ - ity without agonist stimulation . Ki16425 inhibited the basal activity of GTP (cid:3) S binding ( Fig . 3 ) , suggesting that Ki16425 might be an inverse agonist . The basal activity in the inositol phosphate assay , however , was not changed by Ki16425 ( Fig . 2 ) . It remains to be elucidated whether the discrepancy of the results is caused by the differences in the time employed in these assays ( i . e . , 30 min in the GTP (cid:3) S binding assay and 1 min in the inositol phosphate assay ) . Increasing the incuba - tion time of inositol phosphate assay and the effects of other LPA receptor antagonists ( mentioned below ) on the Ki16425 - induced GTP (cid:3) S binding may help to conclude that Ki16425 is a neutral antagonist or an inverse agonist . Recently , several agents have been shown to inhibit LPA - induced actions , although their effects on LPA binding have not yet been reported . DGPP 8 : 0 has been shown to have a preferential competitive property for LPA 3 over LPA 1 and was ineffective on LPA 2 ( Fischer et al . , 2001 ) . Consistent with this , we also observed in the present study that this agent competitively inhibited the LPA - induced Ca 2 (cid:3) re - sponse ; the K i value was estimated to be 3 . 33 (cid:2) M for LPA 3 and 19 . 9 (cid:2) M for LPA 1 , but no inhibitory effect was detected for LPA 2 . Based on the GTP (cid:3) 35 S binding assay in HEK293 cells ( Heise et al . , 2001 ) , VPC12249 has been shown to exert a selective and competitive inhibitory effect on LPA 1 ( K i value of 0 . 14 (cid:2) M ) and LPA 3 ( K i value of 0 . 43 (cid:2) M ) , but not on LPA 2 . Thus , DGPP 8 : 0 is selective for LPA 3 , whereas VPC12249 is selective for LPA 1 and LPA 3 . Ki16425 seems to have a pharmacological specificity similar to that of VPC12249 , but the effect of the former on LPA 2 is not neg - ligible . Thus , Ki16425 has a broad selectivity on LPA recep - tor subtypes compared with the previously described LPA antagonists , although its interaction on the recently identi - fied LPA 4 remains uncharacterized . Such a broad selectivity might be beneficial to the evaluation of the participation of LPA in the biological responses compared with strictly sub - type - selective LPA antagonists . The differential subtype selectivity of Ki16425 and DGPP 8 : 0 was successfully applied for the evaluation of the LPA receptor subtypes involved in biological responses . In the present study , we analyzed in detail the inositol phosphate response to LPA in A431 cells , which seem to express all three EDG - family LPA receptor subtypes but not LPA 4 ( Fig . 8 ) . The LPA - induced action was sensitive to Ki16425 in nor - mal cells ( Fig . 11B ) but insensitive to the antagonist in the PTX - treated cells ( Fig . 11C ) . The change of susceptibility to Ki16425 may be explained as follows . In normal A431 cells , both LPA 1 and LPA 2 may couple to G i and G q , respectively , thereby mediating the LPA - induced inositol phosphate re - sponse ; however , the minor LPA 2 / G q pathway may be masked by the major LPA 1 / G i pathway . When G i was inac - tivated by PTX , however , the LPA 2 / G q pathway was un - masked as a major route for the activation of phospholipase C . The Ca 2 (cid:3) and inositol phosphate responses to LPA in THP - 1 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts seem to be mediated mainly by LPA 1 , as evidenced by their susceptibility to Ki16425 ( Fig . 5 ) but not to DGPP 8 : 0 ( data not shown ) . Although the effect of Ki16425 on LPA 4 has not yet been examined , LPA 4 might be insensitive to Ki16425 , because the Ca 2 (cid:3) response to LPA Subtype Selective Lysophosphatidic Acid Antagonist 1003 a t A SP ET J ou r n a l s on J un e 21 , 2017 m o l ph a r m . a s p e tj ou r n a l s . o r g D o w n l o a d e d fr o m in LPA 4 - expressing HL - 60 cells was barely affected by Ki16425 ( Table 2 ) . The slight difference in the K i value be - tween THP - 1 cells ( 0 . 17 (cid:2) M for Ca 2 (cid:3) response ) and 3T3 cells ( 0 . 54 (cid:2) M for the Ca 2 (cid:3) response and 0 . 68 (cid:2) M for the inositol phosphate response ) might reflect the difference in the con - tribution of LPA 2 or LPA 4 to these responses . Concerning the inhibition of the cAMP response in FRTL - 5 cells , it is likely that LPA 1 is the major receptor subtype in this cell line . First , LPA - induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation was sensitive to Ki16425 ( Fig . 7A ) , but not to DGPP 8 : 0 ( data not shown ) . Second , only LPA 1 among the subtypes was effective for inhibiting cAMP accumulation when transfected ( Im et al . , 2000 ; Noguchi et al . , 2003 ) . Finally , only LPA 1 mRNA was detected in FRTL - 5 cells ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , these antagonists are potentially useful for discerning receptor subtypes in - volved in the given response , even when more than one LPA receptor subtypes is expressed . Ki16425 was also effective in the long - term responses , including DNA synthesis and cell migration in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ( Fig . 9 ) . Although LPA - induced DNA synthesis is one of the well known actions of the lipid mediator , its mech - anism has not been fully characterized . In NIH 3T3 cells and other cell types , LPA - induced DNA synthesis seems to be mediated through a tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF recep - tors ( Daub et al . , 1997 ; Cunnick et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , it is possible that Ki16425 inhibited the LPA - induced action by interacting with the EGF receptor . This mechanism is un - likely , however , because EGF was not a significant stimula - tor for DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ( data not shown ) , and EGF - induced Ca 2 (cid:3) response was not affected by Ki16425 in A431 cells ( Table 2 ) . In any event , Ki16425 main - tained its specific property for a long period ( (cid:4) 24 h ) , suggest - ing again that Ki16425 is a useful agent to evaluate the role of LPA and its receptors in long - term as well as short - term responses . In conclusion , Ki16425 selectively inhibited the EDG - fam - ily LPA receptor - mediated actions with preference to LPA 1 and LPA 3 in vitro . This compound might also potentially serve as a therapeutic drug for diseases that involve LPA and its receptors in their initiation or progression ( e . g . , athero - sclerosis and cancer ) .
