We showed earlier that cortactin is acetylated . Here , we identify SIRT1 ( a class III histone deacetylase ) as a cortactin deacetylase and p300 as a cortactin acetylase . We show that SIRT1 deacetylates cortactin in vivo and in vitro and that the SIRT1 inhibitor EX - 527 increases amounts of acetylated cortactin in ovarian cancer cells . We also show that p300 acetylates cortactin in vivo and that cells lacking or depleted of p300 express less - acetylated cortactin than do control cells . Deletion analysis mapped the SIRT1 - binding domain of cortactin to its repeat region , which also binds F - actin . Mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) lacking sir2 a ( the mouse homolog of SIRT1 ) migrated more slowly than did wild - type cells . The expression of SIRT1 in sir2 a - null cells restored migratory capacity , as did expression of a deacetylation - mimetic mutant of cortactin . SIRT1 and cortactin were more abundant in breast tumor tissue than in their normal counterparts , whereas SIRT1 expression inversely correlates with the ratio of acetylation cortactin versus total cortactin . These data suggest that deacetyla - tion of cortactin is associated with high levels of SIRT1 and tumorigenesis . Finally , breast and ovarian cancer cell lines expressing an acetylation mimetic mutant of cortactin are less motile than that of control cells , whereas cells expressing the deacetylation mimetic mutant of cortactin migrate faster than that of control cells in Transwell migration assays . In summary , our results suggest that cortactin is a novel substrate for SIRT1 and p300 and , for the ﬁrst time , a possible role for SIRT1 in cell motility through deacetylation of cortactin .

Cortactin , a prominent Src substrate and an F - actin - binding protein , is a key regulator of cell migration ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ; Wu et al . , 1991 ; Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . The protein sequence of cortactin contains an N - terminal acidic domain ( NTA ) , six and a half tandem repeats of a unique 37 - amino acid sequence and a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain at the C terminus ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Among these domains , the repeat region is necessary and sufﬁcient to bind F - actin ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . Between the repeats and the SH3 domain is an a - helical structure followed by a proline - rich region . It is well established that Src phosphorylates cortactin primarily at three residues ( Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 and Tyr - 486 ) , which are located between the proline - rich and the SH3 domains , and phosphorylated cortactin are believed to promote cell migration ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , two extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) sites located at Ser - 405 and Ser - 418 sites , and ERK phosphorylation enhances cortactin binding and activa - tion of N - WASP ( Huang et al . , 1998 ; Campbell et al . , 1999 ; Weed and Parsons , 2001 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . Recent studies using mass spectrometry have identiﬁed 17 new sites of phosphorylation ( 12 serine , 4 threonine and 1 tyrosine ) , suggesting that cortactin is heavily phosphorylated in vivo ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . Accumulating evidence supports the notion that cortactin is involved in tumor metastasis ( Buday and Downward , 2007 ) . The human homolog of cortactin is encoded by the gene EMS1 , which is ampliﬁed at chromosome 11q13 in several types of tumors , including head and neck , liver , bladder and breast cancers ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 ; Bringuier et al . , 1996 ; Patel et al . , 1996 ; Yuan et al . , 2003 ) . Increased cortactin gene copy numbers correlate with poor patient prognosis ( Rodrigo et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting that ampliﬁcation of the cortactin gene directly contributes to tumor severity . In cultured ﬁbroblasts , cortactin is mainly distributed along the leading edges of cells , for example in lamellipodia and punctuate - like structures ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ) .

Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 446 Oncogene cells leads to enhanced cell motility and invasion ( Patel et al . , 1998 ) . In MDA - MB - 231 cells , an invasive breast cancer cell line , cortactin is associated with the invadopodium , a cortical structure that penetrates into the extracellular matrix during invasion and overexpres - sion of cortactin in this cell line increases cell migration ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , cortactin potentiates bone metastasis of breast cancer cells in nude mice ( Li et al . , 2001 ) . Lastly , recent ﬁndings demonstrate that ﬁbrosarcoma cells deﬁcient in cortactin have impaired cell migration and invasion , underscoring the role of cortactin in cell motility ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ) . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are enzymes that catalyse the removal of the acetyl moieties from the e - amino group of the lysine residues in histone and non - histone proteins ( Cress and Seto , 2000 ; Grozinger and Schreiber , 2002 ; Blander and Guarente , 2004 ; Gregoretti et al . , 2004 ; Glozak et al . , 2005 ) . These enzymes are members of an evolutionary conserved protein super - family ( Leipe and Landsman , 1997 ) . On the basis of statistical analyses of the evolutionary relationship between all recognizable HDAC relatives , HDACs fall into four distinct classes ( Gregoretti et al . , 2004 ) . Class I consists of HDACs 1 , 2 , 3 and 8 , and class II consists of HDACs 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 and 10 . HDAC11 is the lone member of class IV . Class III HDACs ( also referred as ‘sirtuins’ ) are homologs of yeast SIR2 ( silent informa - tion regulator 2 ) ; and the mammalian members of this class are SIRT1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 . In contrast with the other three classes of HDACs , the activity of the class III HDAC family is NAD þ - dependent . Class III HDACs convert acetyl lysine and NAD þ into O - acetyl - ADP - ribose and nicotinamide . Owing to their dependency on NAD þ , the activity of the class III HDACs is regulated by the NAD þ / NADH ratio , and thus is sensitive to the status of cellular metabolism . Nicotinamide , a product of the deacetylation reactions , inhibits the activity of the class III HDACs , whereas trichostatin A , an inhibitor of classes I , II and IV , does not . Of the seven class III HDAC members , SIRT1 is the best - characterized sirtuin in mammalian cells .

Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 447 Oncogene closest mammalian homolog of yeast SIR2 , an impor - tant aging regulator that extends lifespan in response to energy restriction ( Guarente , 2005 ; Wolf , 2006 ) . How - ever , the role of SIRT1 in tumorigenesis remains largely undeﬁned . Our earlier studies have demonstrated that cortactin is a substrate for HDAC6 ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . Cortactin deacetylation enhances the ability of cortactin to bind F - actin by modulating a ‘charge patch’ in its repeat region , whereas acetylation of cortactin ablates the interaction between cortactin and F - actin , resulting in decreased cell migration . In this study , we show that SIRT1 binds to and deacetylates cortactin , whereas the histone acetyltransferase p300 acetylates cortactin . SIRT1 is able to effectively rescue the migratory defect in sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) . In addition , we show that cortactin is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and that hypoacetylated cortactin is more abundant in breast tumor tissues than in their normal counterparts . Collectively , our ﬁndings suggest a novel role for SIRT1 in tumor cell migration through the deacetylation of cortactin , implying a new function of SIRT1 in tumor invasion and metastasis . Results SIRT1 interacts with cortactin Earlier we found that the class III HDAC inhibitor , nicotinamide , remarkably enhanced the acetylation of cortactin ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . This ﬁnding suggests that class III HDACs deacetylate cortactin . To test this idea , we ﬁrst determined which sirtuins interact with cortactin . Bead - bound glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - cortactin was incubated with lysates of 293T cells transfected with Flag - SIRT1 , Flag - SIRT2 , Flag - SIRT3 , Flag - SIRT4 , Flag - SIRT5 , Flag - SIRT6 or Flag - SIRT7 . GST – cortac - tin – sirtuin complexes were pulled down by the GST beads , and Flag - tagged SIRTs were detected by anti - Flag western blotting . As shown in Figure 1a , Flag - SIRT1 was the only sirtuin that was associated with GST - cortactin .

( a ) 293T cells were transfected with Myc - cortactin and HA - p300 as indicated . After 36h of transfections , cells were lysed and anti - Myc immunoprecipitations were carried out , followed by western blot analysis with anti - acetyllysine antibodies ( anti - Ack ) . The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti - Myc antibodies . A direct anti - HA western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression of HA - p300 . To conﬁrm that p300 was active in this system , a western blot was also performed in the same extracts with an antibody speciﬁc for acetylated K382 of p53 and acetylated histone H3 , respectively . Direct western blots for total p53 and histone H3 were also performed . ( b ) 293T cells were transfected with Myc - cortactin , HA - p300 , p300 shRNA and control shRNA as indicated . Anti - Myc immunoprecipitates were western blotted with antibodies speciﬁc for either AcK or Myc . Levels of HA - p300 were determined by anti - HA antibodies . ( c ) Anti - cortactin immunoprecipitations were performed with p300 þ / þ and p300 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) , followed by a western blot analysis with anti - Ac - cortactin antibodies . The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti - cortactin antibodies . A direct anti - p300 western blot analysis was performed with the same lysates and an anti - HSP60 western blotting analysis was carried out to ensure the equal loading of protein .

All graphs represent data derived from at least three independent experiments . Error bars denote standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) . Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 448 Oncogene We next tested whether SIRT1 and cortactin interact when they are coexpressed . Myc - cortactin was trans - fected into 293T cells with either Flag - SIRT1 or Flag - SIRT2 , and Myc - immunoprecipitates were immuno - blotted with anti - Flag antibodies . Similar to the results of the pull - down experiments , Myc - cortactin interacted with Flag - SIRT1 but not with Flag - SIRT2 in this co - immunoprecipitation analysis ( Figure 1b ) . To determine whether SIRT1 is associated with cortactin under native conditions , co - immunoprecipita - tion of the endogenous protein from C13 cell lysate was performed . C13 cells are ovarian cancer surface epithe - lial cells expressing high levels of SIRT1 and cortactin ( data not shown ) . As shown in Figure 1c , a fraction of SIRT1 could be co - precipitated with an anti - cortactin antibody , but not with control anti - Flag serum . To conﬁrm this interaction , a reciprocal immunoprecipita - tion was carried out . Anti - SIRT1 antibody , but not pre - immune serum , could pull - down cortactin in C13 cells as shown in Figure 1d . Thus , SIRT1 and cortactin indeed interact with each other in an ovarian cancer cell line . To identify the SIRT1 - binding region in cortactin , we used GST - coupled cortactin fusion proteins : cortactin full - length , cortactin NTA region , repeat region of cortactin and cortactin C - term to incubate with cell lysates from C13 cells . GST – cortactin – SIRT1 com - plexes were pulled down by the GST beads and endogenous SIRT1 that interacts with cortactin were detected by a western blotting analysis using anti - SIRT1 antibodies . As shown in Figure 1e , cortactin full - length and repeat region of cortactin are associated with SIRT1 . We next mapped the SIRT1 - binding regions in cortactin by a co - transfection assay in 293T cells . As shown in Figure 1f , Flag - SIRT1 interacts with cortactin N - term , which contains NTA and repeat region , but not with NTA region alone . Taken together with the above GST pull - down experiment ( Figure 1e ) , we speculate that the cortactin repeat region is the SIRT1 - binding domain . Collectively , our data show that similar to HDAC6 , SIRT1 interacts speciﬁcally with the repeat region of cortactin .

Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 449 Oncogene Cortactin acetylation is catalysed by p300 We identiﬁed earlier p300 / CBP - associated factor ( PCAF ) as an acetyltransferase for cortactin ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . However , in PCAF (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs , the levels of acetylated cortactin are the same as those of PCAF þ / þ MEFs , implying that additional cortactin acetyltransferases exist ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . We used a candidate approach and tested multiple acetyltransferases including p300 , Tip60 and HBO for their ability to acetylate cortactin ( Figure 2a and data not shown ) . As shown in Figure 2a , p300 dramatically enhanced the acetylation levels of Myc - cortactin when both were co - expressed in 293T cells .

After 36h of transfections , cells were lysed and anti - Flag immunoprecipitations were carried out , followed by western blot analysis with anti - acetyllysine antibodies ( anti - AcK ) ( upper panel ) . The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti - Flag antibody to examine the pull - down efﬁciency ( second panel ) . Anti - Myc and anti - HA western blot analyses were performed to determine the expression of Myc - SIRT1 ( wt / H363Y ) and HA - p300 ( third and lower panel ) . ( b ) 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids , Myc - cortactin and HA - p300 . After 36h of transfections , cells were lysed and anti - Myc immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST - SIRT1 and NAD þ ( þ , 1m M and þ þ þ , 10m M ) or nicotinamide ( 10m M ) as indicated in 20m M Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) buffer at 30 1 C for 1h . Levels of acetylated cortactin were assessed by a western blotting analysis using anti - acetyllysine antibodies . ( c ) C13 cells were treated with EX - 527 with indicated time and dosage . Cells were lysed , and anti - acetyl cortactin western blot analysis was performed to examine the effect of EX - 527 on cortactin acetylation .

Activity of p300 was validated by its ability to acetylate Lys382 of p53 and core histone H3 ( Figure 2a ) . Moreover , expression of a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to p300 ( Open Systems , Huntsville , AL , USA ) sharply decreased cortactin acetylation in 293T cells expressing Myc - cortactin and HA - p300 ( Figure 2b ) . To further determine whether acetylation of cortacin depends on the presence of p300 , cortactin was immunoprecipitated from p300 þ / þ and p300 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs , followed by an anti - acetyllysine western blotting analysis . The acetylated levels of cortactin were con - siderably lower in p300 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs than those in p300 þ / þ MEFs ( Figure 2c ) . Taken together , p300 is one of the acetyltransferases and perhaps the only one required for cortactin acetylation in vivo . SIRT1 deacetylates cortactin To determine whether SIRT1 deacetylates cortactin , Flag - cortactin , HA - p300 , Myc - SIRT1 and Myc - SIRT1 ( H363Y ) , which is a deacetylase - deﬁcient mutant , were co - transfected into 293T cells as indicated in Figure 3a , and Flag immunoprecipitates were immuno - blotted with an antibody to acetyl lysine ( AcK ) . As shown in Figure 3a , expression of Myc - SIRT1 , but not Myc - SIRT1 ( H363Y ) , reduced the amount of acetylated Myc - cortactin . To assess whether SIRT1 could deace - tylate cortactin in vitro , the in vivo p300 - acetylated Myc - cortactin was served as a substrate , which was incubated with recombinant SIRT1 . The deacetylation ability of SIRT1 toward Ac - cortactin was determined by the in vitro deacetylation assay described in the Supplemen - tary Materials . As shown in Figure 3b , SIRT1 was able to deacetylate cortactin in the presence of NAD þ in a dose - dependent manner , and this property was abro - gated by the addition of the sirtuins inhibitor nicotina - mide , suggesting that SIRT1 indeed deacetylates cortactin in vitro . Conversely , we inhibited SIRT1 catalytic activity by EX - 527 ( Solomon et al . , 2006 ) , a novel , potent and speciﬁc small - molecule inhibitor of SIRT1 , which has no effect on other sirtuins in ovarian cancer cell lines to examine its effect on cortactin acetylation . Consistent with the above ﬁnding , we saw greater amounts of acetylated cortactin in EX - 527 - treated C13 cells ( Figure 3c ) and A2780cp cells ( Figure 3d ) . Taken together , our studies suggest that cortactin is a speciﬁc target for SIRT1 deacetylase activity . SIRT1 stimulates cell migration To investigate whether SIRT1 modulates cell motility , we treated OV2008 cells with the sirtuin inhibitor , nicotinamide , and performed a wound - healing experi - ment . Nicotinamide - treated cells migrated slower than that of vehicle - treated cells ( Figure 4a ) . Acetylation levels of cortactin were dramatically enhanced after nicotinamide treatment by a western blotting analysis using anti - acetyl cortactin antibodies ( Figure 4a ) .

As shown in Figure 4b , sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs were less motile than that of sir2 a þ / þ MEFs . Moreover , the levels of acetylated cortactin were elevated in sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs , implying that SIRT1 is a deacetylase responsible for deacetylating cortactin . To determine whether the reduced migratory ability in sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs is because of the loss of sir2 a , we introduced human SIRT1 into sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs and performed Transwell assays . As shown in Figure 4c , SIRT1 signiﬁcantly restored migration properties of sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs . Therefore , our results indicate that SIRT1 promotes cell migration .

The effect of nicotinamide on cell migration was examined in wound - healing assays . Conﬂuent OV2008 cells were scratched with a 10 - m l pipette tip and photographed at time zero . Then nicotinamide was added to the culture medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 20m M . Photographs were taken 24h later ( left panel ) . OV2008 cells were treated with vehicle control or 20m M nicotinamide for 24h , at which time the acetylation of cortactin was determined by western blotting analysis using an anti - acetyl - cortactin antibody .

As shown in Figure 4d , the deacetylation mimetic cortactin mutant efﬁciently augmented the cell motility in sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs . Thus , our data further strengthen the notion that cortactin functions as a substrate and downstream effector of SIRT1 in regulating cell migration . Acetylation of cortactin negatively regulates cell migration in ovarian and breast cancer cells Our earlier studies demonstrated that cortactin acetyla - tion affected cell migration in NIH 3T3 cells ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . To determine whether the reversible acetylation of cortactin functions in tumor cell migra - tion , we stably transfected Flag - 9KQ or Flag - 9KR into ovarian or breast cancer cells and examined their effect on cell motility . Flag - 9KQ was made by substituting nine acetylatable lysines in the repeat region of cortactin with glutamine to mimic the acetylated status of cortactin , whereas Flag - 9KR was generated by mutating the same nine lysines to arginine to mimic the deacetylated status of cortactin ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . We generated stable clones in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells that overexpress wild - type cortactin , named WT15 , or an acetylation mimetic mutant of cortactin , named 9KQ44 . We also established several MDA - MB - 231 - luc breast cancer cell clones that overexpress wild - type cortactin ( WT15 , WT11 and WT20 ) , an acetylation mimetic mutant of cortactin ( 9KQ44 , 9KQ15 and 9KQ30 ) or a deacetylation mimetic mutant of cortactin ( 9KR7 and 9KR16 ) . As shown by Transwell assays , expression of wild - type cortactin or the deacetylation mimetic mutants increased migration as compared with cells expressing empty vector ( Figures 5a and b ) . In contrast , expression of the acetylation mimetic mutants substantially reduced migration . These results demon - strate that the hypoacetylated form of cortactin promotes cell migration , whereas the hyperacetylated form of cortactin attenuates cell migration in ovarian and breast cancer cells . Cortactin is hypoacetylated in breast tumor tissues Our earlier studies revealed that cortactin is an acetylated protein in vivo ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . To determine whether there is aberrant acetylation of cortactin in cancers , we examined cortactin acetylation in two types of breast tissue specimens : breast cancer tissues and their uninvolved benign counterparts . As shown in Figure 6a , the levels of acetylated cortactin were strikingly decreased in cases 159D and 261D ; however , they were appeared at similar levels in other R a t i o o f A c - c o r t a c t i n vs c o r t a c t i n 159 D 163 A 172 A 196 A 261 B 300 B 429 C 463 A Normal Tumor Cortactin SIRT1 Ac - cortactin β - Actin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 N T N T N T N T N T N T N T N T 159D 163A 172A 196A 261B 300B 429C 463A 2 1 . 8 1 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 21 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 20 Figure 6 Cortactin is hypoacetylated in breast tumor tissue specimens . ( a ) Levels of cortactin acetylation were examined in eight pairs of breast tumor ( T ) and adjacent normal ( N ) tissues . Anti - SIRT1 , anti - acetylated cortactin , anti - cortactin and anti - b - actin western blotting analyses were performed as indicated . ( b ) The acetylated cortactin band and cortactin band were quantiﬁed by densitometry and the intensity of the acetylated cortactin band was normalized to the intensity of cortactin band . The ratio is shown as a bar graph . Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 455 Oncogene cases , but total cortactin levels were dramatically increased in malignant breast tissues . Therefore , after normalizing with the levels of cortactin in ﬁve out of eight pairs ( 159D , 163A , 172A , 261B and 429C ) , acetylated cortactin levels were signiﬁcantly lower in breast cancer tissues as compared with their normal counterparts as shown in Figure 6b . Intriguingly , the levels of SIRT1 inversely correlated with the acetylated cortactin levels in four pairs ( 159D , 163A , 261B and 429C ) of breast tissue specimens ( Figure 6a ) . Collec - tively , these studies suggest that deacetylated cortactin and high levels of SIRT1 are associated with breast tumorigenesis . SIRT1 overexpression may contribute to reduced cortactin acetylation level in breast tumors . SIRT1 is present in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus in ovarian cancer specimens SIRT1 is mostly described as a nuclear protein , whereas cortactin is primarily localized in the cytoplasm . However , the extensive studies of SIRT1 localization in tumor cell lines and tumor specimens are not well documented . We have examined the SIRT1 expression in C13 and OV2008 ovarian cancer cell lines by immunoﬂuorescence staining with anti - SIRT1 antibo - dies , a fraction of SIRT1 was found in the cytoplasm ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ) . We next examined SIRT1 expression in ovarian cancer specimens and normal ovary samples by immunohistochemistry . As shown in Figure 7b , abundant SIRT1 was found in the cytoplasm of ovarian cancer cells , implying the role of SIRT1 with cortactin and cell migration . SIRT1 was also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells ( Figure 7a ) , but was relatively weaker compared with SIRT1 staining in ovarian cancer samples ( Figure 7b ) . Elevated nuclear SIRT1 staining in prostate cancer was recently reported ( Huffman et al . , 2007 ) , and a prostate cancer specimen served as a positive control for anti - SIRT1 antibody ( Figure 7c ) . An anti - mouse IgG immunohistochemistry staining with ovarian cancer specimen served as a negative control for mouse monoclonal anti - SIRT1 antibody ( Figure 7d ) . The percentages of cells expres - sing cytoplasmic or nuclear SIRT1 were examined in normal ovarian tissue and ovarian carcinoma samples by pathologist ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .

Normal ovarian tissues ( n ¼ 3 ) and ovarian carcinomas ( n ¼ 6 ) were immunohistochemically stained with a mouse monoclonal anti - SIRT1 antibody , 10E4 ( brown color ) . The representative images were shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . The black arrow in panel a indicates the normal ovarian surface epithelial ( OSE ) cell . A prostate cancer specimen was immunostained with anti - SIRT1 antibodies as a positive control ( c ) and an ovarian carcinoma tissue sample was stained with anti - mouse IgG as a negative control ( d ) . The white arrow in panel c denotes the nuclei staining of SIRT1 in a prostate cancer cell . To distinguish the nuclei , the section was counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin ( blue color ) . For each panel , the left half was taken with (cid:4) 40 objectives and the right half with (cid:4) 400s objectives . Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 456 Oncogene show that majority of cells express both cytoplamic and nuclear SIRT1 in normal ovarian and ovarian carcino - ma samples . Discussion Mammalian SIRT1 is an NAD þ - dependent deacetylase , which is involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes , including stress responses , cellular metabo - lism , and possibly , aging and tumorigenesis . SIRT1 exerts its functions through diverse substrates , such as nuclear factor - k B , p53 , Ku70 , BCL6 , PGC - 1 a , forkhead transcription factor ( FOXO ) , MyoD and histone ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; Luo et al . , 2001 ; Bereshchenko et al . , 2002 ; Ito et al . , 2002 ; Fulco et al . , 2003 ; Brunet et al . , 2004 ; Cohen et al . , 2004 ; Daitoku et al . , 2004 ; Motta et al . , 2004 ; Vaquero et al . , 2004 ; van der Horst et al . , 2004 ; Rodgers et al . , 2005 ) . In the results presented above , we have added cortactin to this growing list . Given the fact that cortactin is intimately associated with cell migration and sir2 a (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs were less motile than that of their wild - type counterparts , our study provides the ﬁrst indication that SIRT1 modulates cell motility . To examine whether SIRT1 expression is altered in human cancers , we have tested the expression levels of SIRT1 in breast and ovarian cancers . Consistent with the earlier studies that SIRT1 is overexpressed in cancer cell lines and various cancers ( Huffman et al . , 2007 ; Stu¨nkel et al . , 2007 ) , we found that the levels of SIRT1 are elevated in both ovarian and breast cancers ( Figure 6 and data not shown ) . Interestingly , SIRT1 levels inversely correlate with the levels of acetylated cortactin in breast tissue specimens , further suggesting that SIRT1 is one of the deacetylases for cortactin in vivo . SIRT1 , although mainly localized in the nucleus , can be shuttled to the cytoplasm ( Tanno et al . , 2007 ) . A recent study showed that human SIRT1 is highly expressed in the cytoplasm in tissue samples from colon carcinoma patients ( Stu¨nkel et al . , 2007 ) . SIRT1 was present in the cytoplasm in pancreatic islet a and b cells ( Moynihan et al . , 2005 ) and was also found to be cytosolic in C2C12 myoblast cells after differentiation ( Tanno et al . , 2007 ) . The emerging roles of cytosolic SIRT1 were documented recently . Several lines of evidence showed that localization of SIRT1 in the cytoplasm is induced during apoptosis ( Ohsawa and Miura , 2006 ; Jin et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , Hallows et al . demonstrated that SIRT1 catalyses the deacetylation of Acetyl - CoA synthetases ( AceCSs ) in the cytoplasm ( Hallows et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , we found that SIRT1 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in OV2008 and C13 ovarian cancer surface epithelial cells ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ) . In ovarian cancer specimens , a large fraction of SIRT1 was found in the cytoplasm ( Figure 7b and Supplementary Table 1 ) . It is very likely that cytoplasmic SIRT1 stimulates the migra - tion of tumor cells . Further studies a SIRT1 nuclear import - deﬁcient mutant on cell migration will reveal the cytoplasmic function of SIRT1 on cell motility . We showed earlier that HDAC6 binds to and deacetylates cortactin ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , co - treatment with the classes I and II HDAC inhibitor , trichostatin A , and class III inhibitor , nicotinamide , synergistically increased the levels of acetylated cortactin . It is tempting to speculate that HDAC6 and SIRT1 might bind to and enhance each other’s enzymatic activity . In fact , SIRT1 is targeted for acetylation in vivo ( YY and WB , unpublished results ) . However , the deacetylases responsible for SIRT1 deacetylation are largely unknown . It is intriguing how these two deacetylases work on the same substrate , cortactin . Do they work cooperatively , redundantly or in other manners ? Earlier , we showed that the suppression of the activities of HDAC6 and SIRT1 resulted in the robust induction of cortactin acetylation , whereas the inhibitor that suppressed either of the deacetylases caused a moderate increase of cortactin acetylation in HeLa cells ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . Consistent with the data , the levels of acetylated cortactin are only modestly enhanced in either HDAC6 - or sir2 a - null MEFs compared with their wild - type counterparts ( Figure 4b ; Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . Collectively , our data indicate the either HDAC6 or SIRT1 is able to bind and deacetylate cortactin independently , and both of them together confer the additive or synergistic enzymatic activity toward cortactin . Therefore , we propose that HDAC6 and SIRT1 deacetylate cortactin in a cooperative manner . However , as shown in Figure 4a , nicotinamide’s effect on OV2008 cell migration and cortactin acetylation is evident , indicating that SIRT1 is dominant in this cell line . Given the fact that both SIRT1 and HDAC6 bind to the repeat region of cortactin , it is possible that SIRT1 and HDAC6 compete for cortactin deacetylation in OV2008 cells . It is conceivable that it depends on cell types whether HDAC6 and SIRT1 cooperatively or competitively deacetylate cortactin . Nevertheless , there is no doubt that this issue warrants further investigation . It was documented that HDAC6 is associated with SIRT2 and SIRT2 also deacetylates cortactin in vivo ( North et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . However , we failed to detect the association of SIRT2 and cortactin under our experimental conditions ( Figure 1b ) . Therefore , SIRT2 could either form a transit complex with cortactin or it deacetylates cortactin through other deacetylases . Although we captured the SIRT1 / cortactin complex in C13 cells ( Figure 1c ) , the amount of SIRT1 that interacts with cortacin is very little . Given the fact that SIRT1 could efﬁciently deacetylate cortactin in vivo and in vitro ( Figures 3a and b ) , we speculate that SIRT1 either does not form a stable complex with cortactin or deacetylates cortactin by inhibiting p300 as we discussed later . Earlier , we failed to detect the ability of p300 to acetylate cortactin in HeLa cells by co - transfection of HA - p300 and Myc - cortactin ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . However , in 293T cells , we were able to reproducibly monitor the enhanced acetylation cortactin by over - expression of p300 . This discrepancy was probably because of the high transfection efﬁciency in 293T cells , which enabled to express high levels of p300 . Never - theless , the data that the levels of acetylation cortactin were decreased in p300 - deﬁcient cells equivocally demonstrated that p300 is at least in part responsible for acetylation cortactin ( Figure 2c ) . Several lines of Deacetylation of cortactin by SIRT1 Y Zhang et al 457 Oncogene evidence showed that SIRT1 physically interacts with p300 ( Motta et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , SIRT1 negatively regulates the p300 activity by deacetylating the lysine residues at positions 1020 and 1024 , both of which reside in a key regulatory domain ( Bouras et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , SIRT1 may exert two levels of regulation on the deacetylation of cortactin by not only directly deacetylating cortactin but also by inhibiting p300 activity and maintaining cortactin in a hypoacetylated state . p300 is a tumor suppressor gene ( Iyer et al . , 2004 ) . Mutations and deletions of p300 have been observed in a variety of cancers ( Iyer et al . , 2004 ) . Recent studies of p300 - null HCT116 cells indicate that p300 - null cells show loss of cell - to - cell adhesion , defects in cell – matrix adhesion and increased migration ( Krubasik et al . , 2006 ) . Our studies now show that p300 is responsible for acetylation of cortactin , thus providing mechanistic insights into enhanced cell migration in p300 - null cells . Protein post - translational modiﬁcations tend to work in concert at several levels on a given protein . Cortactin is phosphorylated by Src and other kinases . Moreover , phosphorylation of cortactin by c - Src is associated with hyaluronic acid - dependent ovarian tumor cell migration ( Bourguignon et al . , 2001 ) . It would be important to test whether acetylation affects phosphorylation or vice versa . An earlier study showed that the N - terminal domain of cortactin is essential for Src - targeted phos - phorylation at the C terminus ( Head et al . , 2003 ) . As the acetylation primarily occurred within the N - terminal domain of cortactin , it is logical to speculate that acetylation in the N - terminal domain may inﬂuence Src - induced phosphorylation at the C terminus . This hypothesis remains to be further tested . Apart from the role of cortactin in cell migration and invasion , cortactin also plays important roles in other cellular processes , such as vesicular transport , receptor downregulation , and so on ( Cao et al . , 2005 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2005 ; Timpson et al . , 2005 ) . It is very possible that cortactin acetylation might regulate these processes besides cell migration . In summary , our investigations on cortactin acetylation revealed a new function of SIRT1 in regulating cell migration and identify a novel target for HDAC inhibitor - based therapies .
