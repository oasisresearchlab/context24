ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 5 Section 1 . Introduction The Klotho gene was discovered serendipitously when its promoter was disrupted by the insertion of a transgene , resulting in a hypomorphic state of endogenous Klotho deficiency characterized by premature multi - organ degeneration resembling aging [ 1 ] . Although initially characterized as an anti - aging protein , Klotho is now considered an indispensable cytoprotective and tissue maintenance factor [ 2 , 3 ] .  Klotho is the first member of the three member gene family (  ) of single - pass transmembrane proteins [ 4 ] . Of these ,  Klotho has limited organ expression and is highly expressed in the kidney [ 1 , 5 ] The majority of circulating  Klotho is derived from the kidney based on data from renal - specific genetic deletion , renal venous sampling , and organ ablation experiments [ 6 , 7 ] . The extracellular domain of  Klotho is cleaved by proteases and released from the cell ( cleaved  Klotho ) [ 6 , 8 - 10 ] . The  Klotho transcript could also be alternatively spliced to generate a shorter form of  Klotho without the transmembrane domain ( secreted  Klotho ) [ 11 - 13 ] . Collectively , these extracellular polypeptides constitute “soluble  Klotho” which circulates to all organs [ 6 , 13 - 15 ] . In contrast ,  Klotho  and  Klotho are not found in the circulation [ 4 ] . Figure 1 . Trans - membrane and soluble  Klotho released from cells . Kl1 and Kl2 are functional domains . K l 1 K l 2 N C Cleavage(cid:9)by(cid:9)secretase K l 1 K l 2 S o l ub l e (cid:9) α K l o t h o Transmembrane(cid:9) α Klotho ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 6 Transmembrane  Klotho is a co - receptor in conjunction with fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor for ( FGF ) - 23 to regulate mineral metabolism [ 4 ] . Distinct from its co - receptor function , the extracellular domain of  Klotho is released by secretases into blood , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid as an endocrine soluble  Klotho protein [ 11 , 14 , 16 ] , exerting widespread pleiotropic effects on distant organs [ 4 ] ( Figure 1 ) . These actions include anti - oxidation and anti - apoptosis [ 2 , 3 , 17 ] , regulation of growth factors ( e . g . , insulin - like growth factor - 1 , fibroblast growth factors ) [ 18 , 19 ] , signaling molecules ( Wnt ) [ 19 , 20 ] and ion channels ( potassium , transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 5 [ TRPV5 ] ) [ 21 , 22 ] , mineral and hormone metabolism ( calcium , inorganic phosphate , vitamin D ) [ 7 , 23 ] , stem cell function [ 24 , 25 ] , and tumor suppression [ 26 , 27 ] . This article focuses on the lung as an example of a systemic organ that is continuously exposed to a high level of oxidative stress , and that depends on endocrine soluble  Klotho for its proper function . The actions of circulating  Klotho on the lung provides a model for probing the systemic actions , and the consequences of genetic and induced perturbations , of kidney - derived circulating  Klotho on an extra - renal organ , and discusses the potential use of targeted  Klotho replacement for the prevention and / or treatment of secondary pulmonary complications in  Klotho deficient states . Section 2 . The lung : An organ experiencing high oxidative stress The lung interfaces with the atmosphere via a vast surface area and is constantly exposed to fluctuating temperatures , gas pressuress , humidity , airborne pollution , toxins , allergens , pathogens , and one of the highest oxygen tensions of any internal organ . The pulmonary alveolar capillary bed is the largest microvascular organ in the body , and the only organ to receive the entire venous return bearing waste products collected from the whole body . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 7 Furthermore , the lung parenchyma experiences gross mechanical stress and deformation ( strain and shear ) with each respiratory cycle , and microvascular distention and shear with each cardiac cycle . All of these factors cause cumulative oxidative stress and tissue damage , contributing to the inexorable degeneration of lung function with age and the heightened susceptibility of lung cells to malignant transformation . Neonatal lungs are highly sensitive to oxidative stress . Premature - born babies exposed to a high oxygen tension in the intensive care unit develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia , a syndrome of actue lung injury and inflammation that compromised short - term respiratory function and impairs lung growth and maturation leading to long - term respiratory sequelae [ 28 ] . In adults , lung function measured from the forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV 1 ) and forced expiratory vital capacity ( FVC ) decline with age with an inverse correlation to the levels of oxygen free radicals and exhaled nitric oxide [ 29 ] . The capacity for oxygen transport , commonly measured from the lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( DL CO ) , increases with maturation in childhood , peaks in young adulthood , then declines steadily thereafter [ 30 ] regardless of the level of physical fitness . Age - related changes in the distal lung include enlargement of alveolar air spaces without destruction of alveolar walls , reduced alveolar surface tension , loss of lung elastic recoil leading to a reductionin maximum expiratory air flow rate [ 31 ] , and increased mitochondrial DNA mutation [ 32 ] . An increased rate of oxidative stress such as that related to smoking and pollution exposure leads to oxidant - antioxidant imbalance and accelerated aging - related DNA damage in lung tissue [ 32 - 35 ] while the capacity to repair oxidative tissue damage also diminishes [ 32 ] . It is logical that the lung is endowed with generous anti - oxidative capacity [ 36 - 38 ] ; some anti - oxidants are endogenous while others are derived from the circulation [ 39 ] . The fact that the entire right ventricular cardiac output flows through the pulmonary microcirculation also increases circulatory anti - oxidant delivery to lung tissue . Acute or chronic lung diseases ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 8 imposes large increases in oxidative stress that often outstrips endogenous anti - oxidant and / or repair capacity . For example , patients with chronic obstructive lung disease [ 40 ] or cystic fibrosis [ 41 ] are susceptible to oxidative DNA damage , which contributes to more rapid aging - related degeneration and a higher incidence of malignancy in these patients compared to normal age - matched control subjects .

Exogenously injected  Klotho is detected in alveolar epithelial cells but not macrophages . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 9 While endogenous  Klotho expression has been reported in the brain , heart , parathyroid gland [ 42 ] , breast [ 18 ] , gonads [ 43 ] , and bronchial epithelium [ 44 ] , we are unable to detect native αKlotho protein expression within the alveolar septa by immunohistochemistry or transcript expression by RT - PCR [ 1 , 3 ] ( Figure 2 ) . One report of αKlotho mRNA expression by highly sensitive RT - PCR in alveolar macrophages [ 45 ] could not be confirmed from  Klotho protein expression measured by immunoblot [ 46 ] or immunohistochemistry . Claims for  Klotho expression in the lung based solely on using reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction is unreliable as the method is too sensitive and can prime and amplify partially processed transcripts that are never translated [ 47 ] . The existence of the short  Klotho protein translated from alternatively spliced transcript is also questionable as this may represent illegitimate slicing as has been found in many other genes [ 48 ] . There is little doubt that the  Klotho in the lung is primarily derived from the circulation . Section 3 . 1 .  Klotho deficiency alters lung structure and function Disruption of the  Klotho gene ( kl / kl ) encoding the single - pass large protein ( ~ 1000 amino acids ) leads to premature multi - organ degeneration and early death [ 1 ] . We examined the lungs of wild type ( WT ) , haplo - insufficient ( kl / + ) , and homozygous Klotho hypomorphic ( kl / kl ) mice .  Klotho expression is not found in resident lung cells in any of the mice [ 3 ] . The kl / kl mice have no circulating  Klotho ; these mice are small but otherwise phenotypically normal until ~ 4 - 6 weeks of age ; followed by the development of rapid multi - organ degeneration and premature death by 9 - 12 weeks of age . At necropsy their lungs are abnormally friable with grossly enlarged air spaces . The hemizygous  Klotho haplo - insufficient ( kl / + ) mice with 50 % reduced circulating  Klotho level are grossly normal at baseline except the lung exhibits subclinical ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 10 though definite age - exacerbated degeneration with air space enlargement , elevated compliance , and increased apoptosis [ 49 , 50 ] . These abnormalities were initially described as “emphysema - like” , with one major distinction that inflammation is absent . In these genetically altered mice there is a strong correlation between circulating  Klotho level and oxidative DNA damage in lung tissue at baseline [ 3 ] , suggesting high sensitivity of the lung to circulating  Klotho ( Figure 3 ) .

We imposed ambient hyperoxia ( 95 % O 2 ) on human adenocarcinoma - derived alveolar epithelial ( A549 ) and human primary alveolar type I epithelial ( AT1 ) cells ( Figure 4 ) . In both cell types , exogenous  Klotho administration by cDNA transfection or addition of protein alleviates oxygen toxicity measured from cell injury ( lactate dehydrogenase , LDH ) , apoptosis ( caspase - 8 ) , and oxidative DNA damage ( 8 - hydroxy - 2’ - deoxyguanosine , 8 - OHdG ) ; these changes are associated with enhanced endogenous total + / + (cid:9) kl / + (cid:9) kl / kl(cid:9) 0 . 4 - (cid:9) 0 . 3 - (cid:9) 0 . 2 - (cid:9) 0 . 1 - (cid:9) 0 . 0 - (cid:9) 8 - O H d G ( ng / m l ) + / + kl / + kl / kl * (cid:9) * (cid:9) # (cid:9) ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 11 anti - oxidative capacity measured by copper ( Cu ) - reducing equivalents , and activation of the antioxidant response element ( ARE ) of target genes in the nuclear factor erythroid derived 2 transcriptional factor ( Nrf2 ) pathway measured by the firefly luciferase assay ( Figure 4 ) [ 3 ] . In addition , exogenous  Klotho protein protects lung epithelial cells against hydrogen peroxide - induced oxidative damage to DNA , protein and lipid , also via activation of the ARE of target antioxidant proteins in the Nrf2 pathway , in a dose - dependent manner [ 55 ] . Thus , the cytoprotective effect of  Klotho on the alveolar epithelium is mediated via activation of genes that increase the endogenous antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 12 Section 3 . 3 .  Klotho protects the lung against direct oxidant injury in vivo To study the cytoprotective effects of  klotho in vivo , we used a model of hyperoxia - induced pulmonary injury . Intraperitoneal injection of  Klotho - containing media reduces hyperoxia - induced histologic changes in the distal lung , and attenuates lung apoptosis , oxidative DNA damage , and edema ( Figure 5 ) [ 3 ] . In normal rats , baseline serum  Klotho level did not change during hyperoxia exposure for 3 days . Thus , increasing circulating  Klotho level protects against acute lung injury caused by oxidant exposure . Figure 5 . In vivo lung protection by exogenous circulating  Klotho .

Section 3 . 4 .  Klotho protects against lung injury associated with acute kidney injury In contrast to hyperoxia that causes direct redox imbalance leading to lung injury in the presence of a normal serum  Klotho level , renal disease leads to systemic circulating  Klotho deficiency [ 56 , 57 ] . Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) [ 58 - 62 ] , a common clinical disease , represents a ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 13 state of heightened oxidative stress [ 63 ] and a model of titratable endogenous “pan -  Klotho deficiency” where renal , serum , and urinary  Klotho levels all decrease by up to > 90 % [ 15 , 55 , 64 , 65 ] . Thus , AKI is a useful model for studying the pulmonary complications that develop secondary to systemic organ failure . Pulmonary dysfunction develops frequently and to different degrees in clinical and experimental AKI ; this under - appreciated complication of AKI could potentially culminate in the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) [ 58 - 62 ] . Typical clinical manifestations of incipient ARDS include decreased lung diffusing capacity , forced vital capacity and maximal ventilation [ 66 ] , overt inflammation [ 67 , 68 ] , increased alveolar - capillary permeability [ 69 , 70 ] , leading to low - pressure alveolar edema arterial hypoxemia and impaired carbon dioxide excretion [ 71 ] . Severe pulmonary dysfunction requiring ventilator support in the setting of AKI increases mortality from 29 % to 81 % even after multivariate adjustment [ 72 ] . Conversely , the presence of AKI gravely impacts outcome in ventilated critically ill patients [ 73 ] . D evelopment of ARDS in clinical and experimental AKI involves complex pathophysiology and a host of “reno - pulmonary” interactive pathways [ 58 - 62 , 74 , 75 ] . Clinicians often attribute the pulmonary complications to volume overload , heart failure , metabolic acidosis , and sepsis that are prevalent in AKI . Experimentalists point to chemokine accumulation , macrophage infiltration , and deranged ions channels as causes for an increased permeability contributing to an “inflamed , leaky , and wet” lung [ 67 , 76 - 78 ] . Independent from the above , derangement in kidney - derived factors per se such as  Klotho can also cause pulmonary dysfunction but are under - recognized . In rats with AKI due to ischemia - reperfusion injury [ 15 , 65 , 79 ] and severely reduced serum  Klotho level , overt alveolar septal thickening , interstitial edema and exudation develop within 3 days and are associated with elevated tissue oxidative damage and reduced endogenous total antioxidant capacity ( Figure 6 ) [ 55 ] . Systemic injection of  Klotho increases total antioxidant capacity and ameliorates the lung damage and edema without changing peak ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 14 plasma creatinine , i . e . , no change in AKI severity . Thus ,  Klotho repletion in AKI alleviates secondary pulmonary complications independent from its renal effect on alleviation of AKI . Figure 6 .

Trafficking of  Klotho in kidney and lung To act on the lung epithelium , circulating  Klotho must exit the capillaries as a 130 kD glycoprotein . We observed rapid kinetics of  Klotho leaving the renal peritubular capillary followed by uptake by the proximal tubule and urine excretion ( Fig . 7A - C ) [ 6 ] . Within 30 min of an intravenous injection of fluorescent or FLAG - tagged  Klotho , the protein is clearly visible ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 15 within and outside the alveolar capillary , in the extracellular space , and in epithelium ( Fig . 7D ) . The ability of  Klotho to freely exit the vascular space is a generalized property of this protein . Figure 7 :  Klotho trafficking in kidney and lung . A . Kidney .

Differential interference contrast ( Top ) and fluorescent microscopy ( bottom ) of the same image are shown [ 55 ] . 1 – intravascular . 2 – extravascular . 3 – non - vascular cells including type 2 alveolar epithelial cells . Circulating  Klotho is known to interact with the endothelium and the interaction has been postulated to protect the endothelium [ 80 - 83 ] . Transcellular transport across the endothelium ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 16 can occur via pores across the endothelial cell , e . g . vesiculovacuolar organelles , fenestrae , or transendothelial channels [ 84 , 85 ] . Endothelial vesicular endocytosis can proceed via several mechanisms : clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae - mediated endocytosis , clathrin - and caveolae - independent internalization , or macro - pinocytosis [ 86 - 89 ] . Although not yet definitively proven , fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( FGFR1 ) may provide initial docking of soluble  Klotho on endothelial cells , triggering transcytosis pathways that shuttle  Klotho to epithelium .  Klotho binds to FGFR1 [ 90 ] , which is abundant on the apical surface of endothelium [ 91 ] . Most transmembrane proteins that shuttle transport - vesicle cargo are recognized by short , linear amino - acid motifs in their cytoplasmic tails by vesicle adaptor proteins [ 92 ] . The FGFR1 C - terminus has 3 motifs [ 2 YXXØ ( Ø = F , I , L , M , V ) and 1 acidic dileucine EEXXXLL ] that can bind to adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) , which could provide the linkage to initiate clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Section 5 . Mechanisms of  Klotho cytoprotection in the lung Nearly 20 years after its discovery [ 1 ] , the mechanism of  Klotho action remains poorly understood despite a large list of downstream effects in many organs [ 4 ] . The amino acid sequence of  Klotho predicts glycosidase activity [ 1 ] but biochemically  Klotho functions as a glucuronidase [ 65 , 93 ] or sialidase [ 94 ] , and it binds TGF -  [ 95 ] , the transient receptor potential channel 1 , and VEGF receptor - 2 [ 80 ] . If and how these molecular actions translate into cytoprotection remain to be elucidated . Among the pleiotropic actions of  Klotho , anti - oxidative cytoprotection plays a prominent role [ 19 ] . Transgenic  Klotho overexpression confers resistance to paraquat - induced oxidative damage [ 17 ] .  Klotho activates the Forkhead box class O ( FoxO’s ) transcriptional factors and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 17 induces superoxide dismutase - 2 expression [ 17 , 52 ] in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [ 96 ] .  Klotho overexpression drives Nrf2 localization to the nucleus in cells [ 97 ] . Pretreatment of neurons with recombinant  Klotho protects the cells from amyloid β - induced cytotoxicity , and anti - oxidative stress array analysis showed that  Klotho increased the thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin expression system that constitutes downstream effectors of the Nrf2 pathway [ 98 , 99 ] . We know that  Klotho acts directly on epithelial cells [ 4 , 51 , 65 , 93 ] including in the lung [ 3 ] , increases endogenous anti - oxidant capacity in lung cells [ 3 ] and directly activates antioxidant responsive elements in Nrf2 - related endogenous antioxidants ( Figure 4 ) [ 55 ] . The “Cap and Collar” family of transcription factors consists of four members : Nrf ( nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor ) 1 , Nrf2 , Nrf3 , and p45 NF - E2 ( nuclear factor erythroid - 2 ) [ 100 ] . Nrf1 is believed to combat oxidative stress under basal states while Nrf2 mediates response to pathologic challenges such as reactive oxygen species , inflammatory cytokines , and endoplasmic reticulum stress [ 101 - 104 ] . Nrf2 heterodimerize with small Maf ( musculoaponeuroticfibrosarcoma ) proteins and bind to the ARE’s found in the transcriptional regulatory regions of many antioxidant and xenobiotic - metabolizing enzyme genes [ 100 , 105 ] . Instead of relying on any single antioxidant enzyme , Nrf - 2 activation leads to orchestrated up - regulation of many protective proteins to achieve coordinated detoxification . Consistent with this view is the finding of severely impaired activation of many antioxidant and detoxification enzyme genes in Nrf2 - null mutant mice [ 106 ] . The signaling pathways from  klotho to Nrf2 remain to be established . In the lung ,  Klotho increases endogenous anti - oxidant capacity during oxidative stress challenge , and reduces hyperoxia - induced edema and oxidative damage to DNA , protein , and lipids [ 3 ] . Addition of recombinant purified  Klotho to lung cells activates the ARE promoter and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 18 increases endogenous total anti - oxidant capacity measured by either iron - or Copper - based assays [ 3 ] .  Klotho increases protein levels of several antioxidants in the Nrf2 network ( Figure 8 ) . Thus , Nrf2 is likely to be a major pathway by which  Klotho protects the lung . Figure 8 :  Klotho increases endogenous antioxidants in A549 lung epithelial cells . A .

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 19 Besides augmenting endogenous anti - oxidation ,  Klotho upregulates signaling via the paracrine erythropoietin receptor ( EpoR ) in the kidney [ 2 ] . EpoR is an interacting cytoprotective , anti - apoptotic , and pro - angiogenic pathway that protects many organs including the lung against injury [ 107 ] .  Klotho has also been reported to activate autophagy in the kidney to mitigate acute ischemic damage , accelerate recovery , reduce fibrosis , and retard the progression from acute injury to chronic kidney disease [ 64 ] . Autophagy is a fundamental defense mechanism of lysosomal degradation or recycling of cellular components to maintain homeostasis . Whether Klotho also activates EpoR or autophagy flux in the lung , and how these different pathways intersect , are unknown . Section 6 . Potential for targeted pulmonary Klotho replacement in AKI Oxidative stress occurs when the production of oxidants or reactive oxygen species exceeds local antioxidant capacity . With this imbalance , increased oxidation of biologic macromolecules including proteins , lipids , carbohydrates , and DNA lead to tissue damage . AKI represents a state of generalized heightened oxidative stress [ 108 ] . In the PICARD ( Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease ) Study , plasma protein thiol oxidation and carbonyl content increases dramatically in critically ill patients with AKI [ 109 ] . These parameters improve following dialysis with quick interval re - accumulation between dialysis sessions ; plasma pro - inflammatory cytokine levels also increase in parallel [ 109 ] , indicating that the state of heightened systemic oxidative stress in human AKI is amenable to therapy . There has been significant progress in the management of ARDS ; however , except for the use of antibiotics for infections , the mainstay treatment modalities remain supportive with “hopeful ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 20 waiting” for innate healing and recovery to occur . Other than the supportive fluid and electrolyte replacement and dialysis , no specific therapy for ARDS in AKI has improved clinical outcome . At the same time , positive pressure mechanical ventilation with exposure to a high oxygen concentration can induce barotrauma and oxidant stress that further aggravate existing lung injury and increase morbidity and mortality . Survivors of ARDS often endure long - term disability such as lung fibrosis and respiratory insufficiency . There is a definite need for novel treatment modalities to minimize lung damage and accelerate recovery . Given the added oxidative stress in the face of circulating  Klotho deficiency in AKI , and that the lung requires circulating  Klotho for antioxidation , targeted pulmonary  Klotho replacement may have therapeutic value in preventing or alleviating ARDS in AKI . There are several reasons for considering such an approach : 1 . Upon induction of lung injury , an immediate increase in demand for local cytoprotection is not met by a corresponding increase in circulating  Klotho , creating a state of relative Klotho insufficiency , which could exacerbate redox imbalance and perpetuate tissue injury . Targeted exogenous  Klotho delivery to augment local pulmonary  Klotho level as prophylaxis ( pre - injury ) or treatment ( post - injury ) could reduce lung damage and improve outcome . 2 . In terms of understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms , intravenous  Klotho administration may improve various systemic factors that secondarily improve lung function , thereby confounding the ability to conclude how  Klotho exerts direct in vivo effects on the lung . Localized restoration of  Klotho level will address this issue directly . 3 . There may be differential needs for  Klotho replacement in different organs , i . e . the lung may require greater  Klotho delivery as it is exposed to higher basal levels of oxidative stress than other internal organs and therefore more sensitive to  Klotho insufficiency . It may be possible to engineer lung cells to express  Klotho locally as well as simultaneously release a certain amount of soluble  Klotho to the systemic circulation . 4 . Inhalational delivery of cDNA is an excellent ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 21 vehicle to attain sustained protein expression in the lung [ 107 ] compared to the delivery of protein . 5 . Inhalational therapy can be generalized to deliver additional compounds such as cDNA , silencing RNA , microRNA , mixed biologic extracts , proteins , and other pharmaceutical agents that may have beneficial effects on the lung in AKI . We recently validated the technique of inhalational delivery of aerosolized nanoparticles containing protein or DNA [ 107 , 110 ] . We screened six common natural and synthetic polymeric nanoparticle preparations to determine the most promising formulations for pulmonary delivery and uptake by distal lung cells . Poly ( lactic co - glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) nanoparticles are more effectively retained in the distal lung under physiological conditions and hence judged to be promising carriers for pulmonary applications [ 110 ] . We delivered nebulized PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating EpoR cDNA to the lung , and demonstrated rapid uptake by alveolar septal cells with sustained upregulation of EpoR signal transduction in lung tissue that peaks by 10 days and persists for 21 days following a single treatment . This treatment effectively enhances cytoprotection against acute hyperoxic lung injury [ 107 ] . A similar approach could be developed for  Klotho replacement to potentially prevent pulmonary complications in the setting of AKI .
