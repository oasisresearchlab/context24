Baron Keywords : Neuropeptide Calcitonin - gene - related protein Bone marrow stromal cell Osteoblast Osteoclasts Mineralization 33 Previously we observed that capsaicin treatment in rats inhibited sensory neuropeptide signaling , with a 34 concurrent reduction in trabecular bone formation and bone volume , and an increase in osteoclast numbers 35 and bone resorption . Calcitonin - gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) is a neuropeptide richly distributed in sensory 36 neurons innervating the skeleton and we postulated that CGRP signaling regulates bone integrity . In this 37 study we examined CGRP effects on stromal and bone cell differentiation and activity in vitro . CGRP receptors 38 were detected by immunocytochemical staining and real time PCR assays in mouse bone marrow stromal 39 cells ( BMSCs ) and bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) . CGRP effects on BMSC proliferation and osteoblastic 40 differentiation were studied using BrdU incorporation , PCR products , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity , 41 and mineralization assays . CGRP effects on BMM osteoclastic differentiation and activity were determined by 42 quantifying tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase positive ( TRAP + ) multinucleated cells , pit erosion area , 43 mRNA levels of TRAP and cathepsin K , and nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - κ B ) nuclear localization . BMSCs , 44 osteoblasts , BMMs , and osteoclasts all expressed CGRP receptors . CGRP ( 10 − 10 – 10 − 8 M ) stimulated BMSC 45 proliferation , up - regulated the expression of osteoblastic genes , and increased ALP activity and mineraliza - 46 tion in the BMSCs . In BMM cultures CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) inhibited receptor activator of NF - κ B ligand ( RANKL ) 47 activation of NF - κ B . CGRP also down - regulated osteoclastic genes like TRAP and cathepsin K , decreased the 48 numbers of TRAP + cells , and inhibited bone resorption activity in RANKL stimulated BMMs . These results 49 suggest that CGRP signaling maintains bone mass both by directly stimulating stromal cell osteoblastic 50 differentiation and by inhibiting RANKL induced NF - κ B activation , osteoclastogenesis , and bone resorption . 51 © 2009 Elsevier Inc .

In addition to conducting pain and information about thermal , mechanical , and chemical stimuli that have the potential to cause tissue damage , these skeletal sensory neurons produce a variety of peripherally released neurotransmitters including substance P ( SP ) , calcitonin - gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) , and somatostatin . We have observed that capsaicin induced depletion of neuropeptides such as SP and CGRP in the unmyelinatedsensoryneuronsofadultratsisaccompaniedbyboneloss andincreasedbonefragility [ 3 ] . Furthermore , itwasfoundthatboneloss in the capsaicin treated animals was associated with a reduction in the bone formation rate and increased osteoclast numbers and osteoclast surface . Similarly , patients with familial dysautonomia , an autosomal recessive disease occurring mainly in Ashkenazi Jews , suffer from a loss of unmyelinated axons with a reduction in neuropeptide signaling , a reduction in BMD , and a concomitant increase in bone fragility [ 4 – 6 ] .

In the current study we examined the effects of CGRP on bone cells proliferation , differentiation , and function . There is compelling evidence that CGRP signaling has anabolic effects in bone . First , in bone tissue there are numerous nerve ﬁ bers immunostaining for CGRP in the periosteum , bone marrow , and the epiphyseal trabecular bone [ 9 ] . Second , the CGRP receptor complex is expressed in osteoblasts . The CGRP receptor is a dimer complex of two molecules , the G - protein - coupled calcitonin receptor - like receptor ( CRL ) and a receptor activity - modifying protein ( RAMP1 ) , both of which are required for physiological activation by CGRP . CRL and RAMP1 receptors are expressed in mature osteoblasts [ 10 – 14 ] . Third , the administration of CGRP has stimulatory effects in osteoblasts . CGRP increases intracellular levels of cAMP and calcium [ 1 ] , and insulin - like growth factor expression in osteoblast cultures [ 15 ] . Finally , transgenic mice over - expressing CGRP in their osteoblasts have increased bone formation activity and trabecular bone mass [ 16 ] , while α CGRP de ﬁ cient mice display a decreased bone formation rate and accelerated bone loss with aging [ 11 , 17 ] . While numerous investigators have identi ﬁ ed the presence of CGRP receptors and observed CGRP stimulatory effects in osteoblasts , there have been no previous studies examining CGRP receptors or CGRP osteogenic effects in BMSCs . Osteoclasts are derived from mononuclear precursors in the myeloid lineage of bone marrow hematopoietic cells . Macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) is required for these progenitor cells to differentiate into BMMs , but the receptor activator of nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - κ B ) ligand ( RANKL ) is critical for their further differentiation , fusion into multinucleated osteoclasts , activation and survival [ 18 ] . 1 , 25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 can also stimulate osteoclas - togenesis in cultured bone marrow cells , possibly due to an increase in RANKL expression in stromal cells [ 19 ] . Previous investigators have detected mRNAs and protein ( by Western blot ) for the CGRP receptors CRL and RAMP1 in mouse nonadherent bone marrow cell cultures stimulated with M - CSF , but were unable to observe CGRP receptors in bone cell cultures using immunocytochemical techniques [ 20 ] . Another group observed that isolated osteoclasts from vitamin D 3 stimulated mouse bone marrow cultures expressed CRL , but not RAMP1 mRNA [ 21 ] . In the current study we examined the time course of CGRP receptor expression in M - CSF and RANKL stimulated mouse nonadherent bone marrow cell cultures and in RAW 264 . 7 cells . Calcitonin has been widely studied as a therapy for postmeno - pausal osteoporosis because of its inhibitory effects on bone resorption [ 22 , 23 ] . Structurally homologous to calcitonin [ 24 ] , CGRP has been demonstrated to inhibit vitamin D 3 stimulated osteoclasto - genesis [ 25 – 28 ] and bone resorption [ 26 , 29 , 30 ] . Bone resorbing osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of mononuclear progenitors of the monocyte / macrophage system . Two molecules produced by bone marrow stromal cells are required for osteoclast formation and activity ; M - CSF and RANKL [ 18 ] . NF - κ B activation in osteoclast progenitors induces osteoclastic differentiation , activity , and survival [ 31 ] . Furthermore , CGRP inhibits PMA and ionomycin activation of NF - κ B in thymocytes [ 32 ] , suggesting that CGRP inhibitory effects on osteoclast formation and activity may be attributable to inhibitory effects on RANKL activation of NF - κ B in osteoclast precursors . The objectives of the current study were to 1 ) determine when the CGRP receptor dimer complex is expressed in BMSC culture , 2 ) determine whether CGRP stimulates cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs , 3 ) identify the stages of BMSC osteoblastic differentiation at which CGRP can effectively stimulate osteoblastic gene activity , and 4 ) determine whether CGRP can inhibit RANKL induced NF - κ B activation , osteoclastogenesis , and bone resorption in BMMs . Materials and methods BMSC and MC3T3 - E1 osteoblastic cell culture Bone marrow stromal cells from male C57 BL / 6 mice were harvested using established techniques [ 33 ] . Brie ﬂ y , for each experi - ment using BMSCs , six to eight mice were sacri ﬁ ced by CO 2 inhalation and both femur and tibia were excised aseptically , cleaned of soft tissues andthe endsof bones wereremoved . Bonemarrow was ﬂ ushed out with a growth medium containing Minimum Essential Medium Alpha ( α - MEM , Invitrogen ) supplementedwith 10 % ( V / V ) fetalbovine serum ( FBS , HyClone Laboratories Inc . ) , 0 . 25 μ g / ml Fungizone ( Invitrogen ) , and 1 % ( V / V ) penicillin and streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . The cell suspension was prepared by repeatedly aspirating the bone marrow cells through the20 - gauge needle . Cells were thenseeded into 6wellplates , 5 . 6×10 6 cells / well ( day0 ) andgrowninculturemedium . Cultures wereincubatedina humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 at37°C . On day 5 the culture medium for BMSCs was changed to an osteogenic medium consisting of α - MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 50 μ g / ml ascorbic acid ( Sigma ) , 5 mM β - glycerol phosphate ( Sigma ) , 0 . 25 μ g / ml Fungizone , and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . MC3T3 - E1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and maintained in growth medium , containing α MEM , 10 % FBS , and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . The MC3T3 - E1 cells were seeded in the 24 well plates and cultured in growth media supplemented with 50 μ g / ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM β - glycerol phosphate to promote differentiation . BMM and osteoclastic cell culture Bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) were cultured as previously described [ 34 ] . Macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) de - pendent macrophages were obtained by culturing the nonadherent bone marrow cells in the presence of 20 ng / ml M - CSF ( R & D Systems ) in growth medium overnight . Starting on day 1 , cells were treated in an osteoclastogenic medium consisting of α MEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 ng / ml RANKL ( R & D Systems ) , and 10 ng / ml M - CSF . Mouse BMMs were puri ﬁ ed for the Western blot assay by collecting the nonadherent cells from the fresh mouse bone marrow cell cultures which were then layered on a Ficoll - Hypaque gradient ( GE Healthcare ) . Cells mainly consisting of macrophages and monocytes at the gradient interface were collected and cultured for 3 – 4 days at 6×10 6 cells per 60 - mm plate in α - MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS in the presence of 10 ng / ml M - CSF . The CGRP used in these studies was α CGRP ( Sigma ) , which differs from β CGRP by just one amino acid . The α CGRP and β CGRP peptides have equipotent af ﬁ nity for the CGRP receptor ( calcitonin receptor - like receptor , CLR ) and equipotent pharmacologic activity . The CGRP was dissolved in distilled water to a ﬁ nal concentration of 10 − 4 M , and then wasaliquotedandstoredat − 20°C . Immediatelybeforeusing , theCGRP was diluted to the appropriate concentration in the culture medium . Starting on day 1 the mouse BMSCs or BMMs were continuously stimulated with CGRP at concentrations of 10 − 14 , 10 − 12 , 10 − 10 , and 10 − 8 M , and the medium was changed every 2 days . Immuno ﬂ uorescence confocal microscopy Mouse BMSCs , MC3T3 - E1 cells , and BMMs were cultured on cover slips . The BMSCs were separately stained on days 7 , 14 , and 21 post - seeding , the MC3T3 - E1 , BMMs , and RAW 264 . 7 cells were stained on day 7 post - seeding . The cells were ﬁ xed for 20 min with 3 . 7 % ( V / V ) paraformaldehyde at room temperature and then permeabilized with 1370 L . Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 ice - cold ethanol for 5 min [ 35 ] . BMSCs and MC3T3 - E1 cells were incubated with 5 % FBS plus 1 % bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h to reduce background staining , then treated with primary antibodies against mouse CGRP receptor , CRL ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and mouse alkaline phosphatase ( R & D Systems ) or mouse RAMP1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) overnight at 4 °C . Cells were then treated with the PE - or CY3 - and FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) in 1 : 200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature . BMMs were stained with primary antibodies against mouse CRL and mouse RAMP1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or mouse TRAP ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Control slides were stained with just the secondary antibody . Immunostained cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope and the confocal software was used for acquisition of the data and merging of the digital images . Cell proliferation The effect of CGRP on the proliferation of adherent bone marrow stromal cells was determined by measuring BrdU incorporation using a Roche Cell Proliferation ELISA kit ( Roche Diagnostics Corp ) . Brie ﬂ y , the adherent bone marrow stromal cells were plated into 96 well plates at a seeding density of 1×10 5 cells / well and cultured on the condition described previously . On day 4 , BrdU was added to the culture medium 4 h prior to the assay . The incorporated BrdU in each culture was quanti ﬁ ed by the Molecular Device microplate system according to the manufacturer ' s instruction . Alkaline phosphatase activity Increased alkaline phosphatase activity is an early marker of osteoblastic differentiation . Cell layer lysates of BMSCs and MC3T3 - E1 cells were collected in 0 . 1 % Triton - X and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured as a function of release of p - nitrophenol from p - nitrophenylphosphate at pH 10 . 2 [ 36 ] . Protein content of the cell layer was determined by the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) protein assay ( Pierce Chemical Co ) . The results of this assay were con ﬁ rmed by repeating the experiment 3 times . Mineralization CGRP was added to the BMSC culture medium over a 21 - day period . At the end of incubation , the medium was removed and the culture was brie ﬂ y washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) followed by ﬁ xation in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min . Calcium deposits in the BMSC cultures were stained with 2 % Alizarin red ( Sigma ) for 10 min as previously described [ 37 ] . The Alizarin red bound to the calcium salts in the cell matrix was eluted with 10 % cetylpyridinium chloride ( Sigma ) , and the staining intensity was quanti ﬁ ed by measuring absorbance at 540 nm and calculated according to a standard curve . One molar Alizarin red selectively binds about 2 mol of calcium [ 38 ] . Then the relative cell numbers in the same culture were estimated by crystal violet staining [ 37 ] . The values of mineralization were normalized by the absorbance of crystal violet staining at 590 nm in this study . Quantitative real time PCR Total RNA from the BMSCs and BMMs grown in 6 - well plates was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) and the purity and concentration were determined spectrophotometrically . The cDNA ( 20 μ l ﬁ nal volume ) was subsequently synthesized from 1 μ g RNA using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Bio - Rad Lab ) . Real time PCR reactions were conducted using the SYBR Green PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . The primer sequences used in these experi - ments are listed in Table 1 . To validate the primer sets used in this study , the dissociation curves were performed to document single product formation and the agarose gel analysis was carried out to con ﬁ rm the size . The data from real time PCR experiments were analyzed by the comparative CT method as described in the manual for the ABI prism 7900 real time system . All results were con ﬁ rmed by repeating the experiment 3 times . Tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) staining and pit reabsorption assay BMMs were plated in 48 - well plates at a seeding density of 5×10 5 cells / well and cultured for 7 or 8 days in media containing 10 ng / ml M - CSF and 50 ng / ml RANKL . At the end of the culture period TRAP staining was performed using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit ( Sigma ) to identify TRAP + osteoclasts containing 3 or more nuclei . TRAP + osteoclast numbers were counted using a Bioquant Image Analysis system . To evaluate the effects of CGRP treatment on osteoclast resorption activity , BMMs were cultured on BD BioCoat Osteologic Discs Multi Test Slides ( BD Biosciences ) at a seeding density of 1×10 5 cells / well Table 1 Primer sequences for the calcitonin - gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) receptor gene ( CALCRL ) , CGRP receptor activity - modifying protein 1 ( RAMP1 ) , osteocalcin ( OCN ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , collagen type 1 ( COL1 ) , Runt related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ) , tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) , cathepsin K ( CTSK ) and 18S rRNA gene ( 18S ) .

Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 for 10 days . All cells were then removed with bleach and erosion area was visualized and measured by using the Bioquant Image Analysis system ( Nashville , TN ) . Western blot Tostudy theeffects of SP on NF - κ B activation inBMMs , Westernblot analysis was used to measure expression of the dominant NF - κ B subunit , the p65 protein , in nuclear extracts prepared from BMMs as previously described [ 39 ] . Brie ﬂ y , BMMs were washed with ice - cold PBS , scraped and brie ﬂ y centrifuged . The cell pellet was then resuspended in a hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 5 μ g / ml leupeptin , and 6 . 4 % Nonidet P - 40 and incubated for 15 min on ice . After another brief centrifugation , the nuclear pellet was collected and suspended in nuclear extractionbuffer containing20mMEDTA , 25 % glycerol , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM 4 - ( 2 - aminoethyl ) benzenesulfonyl ﬂ uoride , 5 μ g / ml pepstatin A and 5 μ g / ml leupeptin . After incubation on ice for 30 min , thenuclearextractwascollected , boiledwith3×sodiumdodecylsulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer , and then subjected to SDS electrophoresis . The concentration of protein in the samples containing NF - κ B p65 was measured by using a DC Protein Assay kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Equal amounts of protein were size fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride membrane . The blot was blocked for overnight in 5 % non - fat dry milk in Tris - buffered saline with 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 ( TBST ) , and incubated with primary mouse anti - NF - κ B p65 antibody ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 24 h . After washing in TBST , the blots were incubated in horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti - mouse antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ( diluted in 1 : 5000 ) for 1 h at room temperature . The membrane was then washed again and exposed to ﬁ lm following chemiluminescence reagent treatment with the ECL plus Western blotting reagents ( Amersham ) . Bands were quanti ﬁ ed using densi - tometry of digitalized images . Each blot was then stripped and re - probed with anti - β actin antibodies , thus allowing normalization of expression between samples . The results of this assay were con ﬁ rmed by repeating the experiment 3 times . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4 . 02 ( GraphPad Software ) . All data were evaluated using an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing . Data are presented as the mean±standard error of the mean ( SEM ) and a p ≤ 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Each experiment was repeated at least two to three times in this study to ensure the validity of the data . The data presented are from a single experiment . Results Expression of CGRP receptors in osteoblasts Confocal microscopy demonstrated co - expression of the CGRP receptor CRL and the osteoblast marker alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of adherent BMSCs , as shown in Figs . 1A , B , and C . All adherent BMSCs grown in osteogenic medium expressed both alkaline phosphatase and CRL after 14 days of cell culture . Co - labelingforbothCRLanditschaperoneproteinRAMP1was observed in BMSCs at 7 , 14 , and 21 days of cell culture ( Figs . 1D – F ) . Osteoblastic MC3T3 - E1 cells also co - expressed CRL and RAMP1 receptors ( Figs . 1G – I ) . To further characterize CGRP receptor mRNA expression during osteogenic differentiation , real time PCR was performed to quantify mRNA levels of CRL and RAMP1 in BMSCs at various time points of cell culture ( Figs . 1J , K ) . After normalization to 18S , there was a 57 % decline in RAMP1 mRNA expression in BMSCs over time , from day 3 to day 21 post - seeding . In contrast , no temporal changes were observed in CRL expression in BMSCs . CRL and RAMP1 mRNAs were also expressed at high levels ( relative to 18S ) in the osteoblastic MC3T3 - E1 cells and in brain tissue homogenate . Effect of CGRP on BMSC proliferation CGRP effects on osteoprogenitor cellular proliferation were assessed using the BrdU incorporation assay . Three different con - centrations of CGRP ( 10 − 12 , 10 − 10 , and 10 − 8 M ) were tested in BMSCs at day 4 post - seeding , but only the 10 − 10 M concentration signi ﬁ cantly increased BrdU incorporation by 36 % ( p b 0 . 05 ) , com - pared to vehicle - treated control cultures ( data not shown ) . Effect of CGRP on osteoblast differentiation This study was designed to examine the concentration - dependent effects of CGRP ( 10 − 12 – 10 − 8 M ) on mouse primary BMSC osteogenic differentiation through the three distinct stages of cellular activities ; proliferation , extracellular matrix maturation , and matrix minerali - zation [ 40 ] . Osteoblastic gene expression was evaluated by real time PCR and total mRNA was isolated from BMSCs on days 7 , 14 , and 21 of the culture period . Genes of interest included alkaline phosphatase , osteocalcin , collagen type I , and Runx2 ( Fig . 2 ) . Alkaline phosphatase and collagen type I were selected as early markers and osteocalcin was selected as a late marker of osteoblastic differentiation . Runx2 , a transcriptional factor necessary for osteoblast differentiation , was also examined . The addition of CGRP ( 10 − 10 – 10 − 8 M ) to the cell media signi ﬁ cantly increased BMSC gene expression of alkaline phosphatase , collagen type I , osteocalcin , and Runx2 in BMSCs at 7 and 14 days of cell culture , but not day 21 ( Fig . 2 ) . CGRP ( 10 − 12 , 10 − 8 M ) had no effect on osteocalcin , collagen type I , and Runx2 gene expression in osteoblastic MC3T3 - E1 cell cultures at 4 or 7 days post - seeding , but CGRP ( 10 − 12 and 10 − 8 M ) did increase alkaline phosphatase expression in MC3T3 - E1 cells on day 4 , but not day 7 of cell culture ( data not shown ) . Next , we evaluated the effect of chronic CGRP treatment on BMSC alkaline phosphatase activity . The effect of CGRP treatment on BMSC alkaline phosphatase activity was examined on days 7 , 14 , and 21 of the culture period ( Fig . 3A ) . CGRP increased the alkaline phosphatase activity in BMSCs in a time and concentration - dependent manner . During the ﬁ rst 7 days , the alkaline phosphatase activity was not altered by CGRP treatment ( data not shown ) . Compared to untreated time - matched controls , CGRP at the 10 − 10 M concentration increased alkaline phosphatase activity by 7 . 4 fold at day 14 and by a lesser extent at day 21 . Similarly , the 10 − 12 M concentration of CGRP signi ﬁ cantly stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3 - E1 cells at day 4 and to a lesser extent at day 7 post - seeding ( data not shown ) . Finally , we examined theeffectofCGRP on BMSC mineralization and cellular proliferation ( Fig . 3 ) . Continuous CGRP treatment ( 10 − 10 M to 10 − 8 M ) over21daysstimulatedmineralizationinBMSCculturesatday 21 post - seeding , as measured by Alizarin red staining ( Fig . 3B ) . Continuous CGRP treatment ( 10 − 12 M to 10 − 8 M ) modestly decreased BMSC cellnumbers , asestimated by crystalviolet staining , overa21day cultural period ( range 14 – 21 % , Fig . 3C ) . When mineralization was normalized to relative cell numbers ( Alizarin red / crystal violet ) the CGRP stimulatory effects on mineralization persisted ( Fig . 3D ) . Expression of CGRP receptors in osteoclasts and their progenitors The expression of CGRP receptors was studied in the mouse bone marrow derived osteoclast cultures by confocal microscopy . Immu - no ﬂ uorescence for CRL was mainly detected in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane of TRAP + BMMs and osteoclasts ( Figs . 4A – C ) . 1372 L . Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 Fig . 1 . Laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated the presence of the calcitonin - gene - related protein ( CGRP ) receptors in adherent mouse bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) . The CGRP receptor is a dimer complex of two molecules , the calcitonin receptor - like receptor ( CRL ) and a receptor activity - modifying protein ( RAMP1 ) , both of which are required for physiological activation by CGRP . Alkaline phosphatase and the CRL receptor co - localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of BMSCs on day 14 of cell culture . The presence of green ﬂ uorescence indicates the presence of alkaline phosphatase ( A ) , the presence of red ﬂ uorescence indicates the presence of CRL ( B ) , and the presence of yellow ﬂ uorescenceindicatesco - labelingforthetwoproteinsinthesamecellularmicrocompartment ( C ) .

Real time PCR analysis of RAMP1 ( J ) and CLR ( K ) mRNA levels are shown for mouse BMSCs , brain and MC3T3 - E1 cells . RAMP1 mRNA levels in BMSC cultures gradually dropped from day 3 to day 21 post - seeding , while CRL expression remained stable over time . Values are means±SEM for six wells and CRL and RAMP1 mRNA levels were normalized to 18S mRNA levels . 1373 L . Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 The CRL immunostaining was more intense in BMMs and preosteo - clasts than in mature osteoclasts . Furthermore , CRL and RAMP1 immuno ﬂ uorescence was co - localized in BMMs and osteoclasts on day 7 of culture period ( Figs . 4D – F ) . CRL and RAMP1 immunostaining was also observed in the macrophage RAW 264 . 7 cell line ( data not shown ) . Real time PCR was performed to quantify mRNA levels for RAMP1 and CRL in BMMs and osteoclasts on day 4 and day 7 of the culture period ( Figs . 4G , H ) . After normalization to 18S , there was a 46 % decline in RAMP1 mRNA expression by day 7 and a 38 % increase in CRL expression . Effect of CGRP on osteoclast formation and function CGRP effects on osteoclastogenesis from nonadherent bone marrow cells were evaluated by counting the number of multinucle - ated TRAP + cells at day 7 post - seeding ( Fig . 5A ) . In addition , CGRP effects on osteoclast resorption activity were examined in nonadher - ent bone marrow cells grown on BD Biocoat osteologic discs for 10 days , after which the erosion area was quanti ﬁ ed ( Fig . 5B ) . All cell cultures were treated with 10 ng / ml M - CSF and 50 ng / ml of RANKL . Without the addition of RANKL no osteoclastogenesis or resorption activity was observed . Only the 10 − 8 M concentration of CGRP decreased osteoclastogenesis , reducing the TRAP + cell number by about 50 % . Osteoclasts derived from nonadherent bone marrow cells formed resorption pits after 10 days of culture and CGRP treatment decreased the erosion area in a concentration - dependent manner . Compared to untreated cells , the 10 − 10 M concentration of CGRP reduced erosion area by 64 % and the 10 − 8 M concentration of CGRP reduced erosion by 80 % . Effect of CGRP on osteoclast differentiation Real time PCR was used to quantify the effects of CGRP on gene expression for TRAP and cathepsin K in nonadherent bone marrow cell cultures at day 7 post - seeding ( Figs . 6A and B ) . All cell cultures were treated with 10 ng / ml M - CSF and 50 ng / ml of RANKL . CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) treatment decreased TRAP mRNA levels by 33 % and reduced cathepsin K mRNA levels by 23 % . CGRP activation of NF - κ B in BMMs CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) treatment alone had no effect on nuclear NF - κ B - p65 levels in BMMs , but adding the receptor activator of NF - κ B ( RANKL ) to the BMM culture media caused a 3 - fold increase in NF - κ B activation within 30 min . When the BMMs were treated with both RANKL and CGRP there was no increase in NF - κ B activation ( Fig . 6C ) . These results indicate that CGRP inhibits RANKL induced NF - κ B activation in osteoclast progenitors , at critical step in osteoclastogen - esis and resorption activity . Discussion CGRP acts at the cellular level by binding to its seven transmem - brane domain G - protein - coupled receptor [ 41 ] . A functional CGRP receptor requires heterodimerization of CRL with a single - transmem - brane domain protein , the receptor activity - modifying protein - 1 ( RAMP1 ) , which allows the receptor complex to reach the cell surface [ 42 , 43 ] . CRL and RAMP1 mRNAs have been detected in the mouse MC3T3 - E1 osteoblastic cell line , the human MG63 osteoblastic cell line , rat primary calvarial osteoblasts , and in human primary Fig . 2 .

Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 osteoblast cell cultures [ 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 ] . CRL and RAMP1 proteins have been identi ﬁ ed in the MC3T3 - E1 and MG63 cell lines using the Western blot assay , and immunocytochemical studies in MG63 cells demonstrate co - labeling of plasma membrane sites with anti - CRL and anti - RAMP1 antibodies [ 10 , 14 ] . The current study now extends these ﬁ ndings to osteoblast precursor cells , demonstrating for the ﬁ rst time the co - localization of CRL and RAMP1 proteins on the plasma membrane of adherent BMSCs and in MC3T3 - E1 cells ( Fig . 1 ) . In addition , BMSCs and MC3T3 - E1 cells expressed mRNA for CRL and RAMP1 receptors ( Figs . 1J , K ) . Expression of RAMP1 mRNA in BMSCs peaked at day 3 post - seeding and then gradually declined during osteoblastic differentiation , while CRL mRNA levels remained stable between days 3 to day 21 post - seeding . Numerous studies have looked at CGRP effects on osteoblastic cell lines and in primary rat or human osteoblast cell cultures [ 13 – 15 , 44 – 49 ] . CGRP has been shown to bind to the cell membrane and to increase intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) and calcium in osteoblastic cells . Furthermore , the addition of CGRP to osteoblast cell culture media also stimulates cell proliferation , synthesis of cytokines and growth factors ( including insulin - like growth factor I ) , and collagen synthesis . The osteogenic effects of CGRP on bone marrow stromal cells , the primary source of osteoprogenitor cells , have not been previously described . Osteoblastic differentiation in vitro is marked by three distinct stages of cellular activities : proliferation , extracellular matrix maturation , and matrix mineralization . Being directed by Runx2 , the master transcription factor regulating bone formation , BMSCs can differentiate towards the osteoblastic lineage , accompanied by increased alkaline phosphatase activity and production of type I collagen and osteocalcin [ 50 ] . The current study examined mouse BMSCs throughout the cell life cycle to determine at which time points CGRP regulated cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation occurs . When BMSCs were treated with CGRP ( 10 − 10 – 10 − 8 M ) for 7 or 14 days there was an increase in osteoblastic gene expression , including Runx2 , alkaline phosphatase , osteocalcin , and collagen type I ( Fig . 2 ) . CGRP stimulatory effects on BMSC osteoblastic differentiation were only observed during the ﬁ rst 2 weeks of cell culture , prior to the onset of mineralization [ 51 ] . In addition , CGRP ( 10 − 10 M ) stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity in BMSCs at day 14 and to a lesser extent day 21 post - seeding ( Fig . 3 ) , and in MC3T3 - E1 cell cultures at day 4 and to a lesser extent day 7 of cell culture ( data not shown ) . CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) treatment for 21 days also increased BMSC mineralization , as measured by the Alizarin red assay ( Fig . 3 ) . We also observed that CGRP ( 10 − 10 M ) treatment stimulated BMSC proliferation ( data not shown ) . However , com - pared to the impact on osteoblast gene expression , the effects of CGRP on osteoblast progenitor proliferation are rather moderate . Our result is in line with the ﬁ ndings that α CGRP knockout mice have decreased bone formation , but normal osteoblast numbers [ 17 ] . Collectively , these novel data are the ﬁ rst to demonstrate CGRP ' s stimulatory effects on osteoblastic differentiation in bone marrow osteoprogenitors . CGRP ' s stimulatory effects were restricted to the earlier stages of osteoblast development , suggesting that its osteogenic effects are primarily due to its ability to direct stromal progenitors into the osteoblastic lineage .

Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 Previous studies have presented con ﬂ icting data regarding the presence of CGRP receptors in BMMs [ 20 , 21 ] . In the current study both CRL and RAMP1 mRNAs were detectable in nonadherent mouse bone marrow cells at 4 days post - seeding ( Figs . 4G , H ) and in the RAW 264 . 7 macrophage cell line ( data not shown ) . In addition , immuno - cytochemistry was used to identify CGRP receptor protein at the cellular level . TRAP + monocytes and multinucleated osteoclasts derived from mouse bone marrow cells , and macrophages from the RAW 264 . 7 cell line all expressed both CRL and RAMP1 proteins ( Figs . 4A – F , RAW 264 . 7 data not shown ) . CGRP signi ﬁ cantly inhibits vitamin D 3 induced osteoclastogenesis in macrophages [ 25 – 27 ] . In addition , Ishizuka et al . observed that CGRP ( 10 − 7 M ) inhibited BMM osteoclastogenesis only in the presence of RANKL [ 28 ] . Furthermore , the addition of CGRP ( 10 − 11 to 10 − 7 M ) to enriched osteoclast cultures inhibits bone resorption activity [ 26 , 29 , 30 ] . In the current study we have con ﬁ rmed and extended these observations , showing that CGRP ( 10 − 10 to 10 − 8 M ) inhibited ; 1 ) the formation of TRAP + multinucleated cells , 2 ) the erosion area on coated BD BioCoat osteologic discs , and 3 ) the expression of TRAP and cathepsin K mRNA in M - CSF and RANKL stimulated bone marrow cell cultures ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . Osteoclast precursor differentiation and activation by RANKL requires the sequential activation of NF - κ B , c - Fos , and NFATc1 [ 18 , 31 ] . Millet et al . observed that CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) selectively Fig . 4 . Confocal microscopy demonstrating CGRP receptors in M - CSF and RANKL stimulated mouse nonadherent bone marrow stromal cell cultures at day 7 post - seeding . Under these conditions the majority of stromal cells in the culture medium are transformed into bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) , preosteoclasts , and osteoclasts .

Realtime PCR measurements of RAMP1 ( G ) and CRL ( H ) mRNA levels are shown in BMM cultures at days 4 and 7 post - seeding .

Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 interfered with the nuclear accumulation of NF - κ B in thymocytes by increasing the levels of I κ B proteins , which normally retain NF - κ B in the cytoplasm , thus preventing nuclear translocation [ 32 ] . Now we have observed that CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) blocked RANKL induced activa - tion of NF - κ B in BMMs , but the addition of CGRP without RANKL had no effect on the basal activation of NF - κ B in BMMs ( Fig . 6 ) . Collectively , these data suggest that CGRP inhibition of osteoclasto - genesis is due to its inhibitory effects on RANKL induced activation of NF - κ B in BMMs . We have observed that selective sensory nerve ablation in rats can induce a chronic increase in trabecular bone osteoclast surface per bone surface ( Oc . S / BS ) and osteoclast number ( N . Oc . ) , with a concurrent reduction in bone volume , suggesting that sensory signaling has an inhibitory effect on bone resorption [ 3 ] . Furthermore , daily injections of the sensory transmitter CGRP can prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats primarily by reducing bone resorption activity , additional evidence that sensory neuropeptides can have inhibitory effects on osteoclast function [ 52 ] . Collectively these data suggest that Fig . 5 . Effects of CGRP on osteoclast formation and resorption in M - CSF and RANKL stimulated mouse nonadherent bone marrow stromal cell cultures . Osteoclast formation was measured by counting multinucleated TRAP + cells per well ( A ) and osteoclast resorption was evaluated by measuring total erosion area on BD BioCoat osteologic disc ( B ) . CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) treatment reduced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in the BMM cell cultures . Values for TRAP + cells are means±SEM for six wells , and erosive areas are means±SEM for six to eight discs . Panel C shows representative photomicrographs of TRAP + osteoclasts in controls ( a ) and after CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) treatment ( b ) and the erosion area in controls ( c ) and after CGRP ( 10 − 8 M ) treatment ( d ) . ⁎ p b 0 . 05 , ⁎⁎ p b 0 . 01 vs . control . 1377 L . Wang et al . / Bone 46 ( 2010 ) 1369 – 1379 sensory neuropeptide signaling can inhibit osteoclast formation and function in vivo . Unexpectedly , α CGRP de ﬁ cient mice have normal bone resorption parameters . There is no change in osteoclast number per bone surface ( N . Oc . / BS ) , osteoclast surface per bone surface ( Oc . S / BS ) , or urinary deoxypyridinoline levels [ 11 ] . These data suggest that either CGRP has no effect on bone resorption or perhaps the loss of just the α CGRP signal is not enough to alter osteoclast formation and resorption activity . In sensory nerves there are actually two different calcitonin - gene - related peptides , termed α CGRP and β CGRP , belonging to the calcitonin family of peptides . The α CGRP peptide is generated by alternative splicing of the calcitonin gene Calca , while β CGRP is derived from a separate gene , termed Calcb , that is located in close proximity to Calca , both in mice and humans . The sequence homology between α CGRP and β CGRP is over 90 % and they both activate the same CGRP receptor complex . Conceivably , in α CGRP de ﬁ cient mice the release of β CGRP from sensory terminals could compensate for the loss of the α CGRP signal , thus maintaining CGRP inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption . This study is unique in that it comprehensively investigated the concentration - dependent effects of CGRP signaling on primary osteoblast and osteoclast progenitor cells throughout the period of cell differentiation , looking speci ﬁ cally at cellular proliferation , differentiation , function , and intracellular and transmembrane sig - naling . CGRP receptor expression was also observed at various time points during cell differentiation in both primary osteoblast and osteoclast cell cultures and in cell lines . CGRP directed the differen - tiation of BMSCs towards mature osteoblasts and inhibited RANKL induced activation of NF - κ B , osteoclastogenesis , and bone resorption in BMMs . These in vitro effects suggest that the relative concentration of CGRP in bone could be an important determinant of bone mass and strength , a hypothesis supported by the osteopenic skeletal pheno - type observed in α CGRP de ﬁ cient adult mice [ 11 , 17 ] . Although it is impossible to generate and characterize the skeletal phenotypes of the mice lacking the CRL component of the CGRP receptor , due to embryonic lethality [ 53 ] , this lethality is due to the loss of adrenomedullin signaling that is mediated by the CRL and RAMP 2 or RAMP 3 receptor dimer complex . Future characterization of the skeletal phenotypes of mice lacking expression of both α CGRP and β CGRP , or in mice lacking the RAMP1 component of the CGRP receptor dimer complex , will undoubtedly further our understanding of neuro - osseal regulation of bone metabolism and integrity .
