A . , and § Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Evaluation Center , National Institute of Health Science , 3 - 8 - 21 Toranomon , Minato - ku , Tokyo 105 - 8409 , Japan The actin - binding protein p57 / coronin - 1 , a member of the coronin protein family , is selectively expressed in immune cells , and has been implicated in leucocyte migration and phagocytosis by virtue of its interaction with F - actin ( ﬁlamentous actin ) . We previously identiﬁed two sites in the N - terminal region of p57 / coronin - 1 by which it binds actin , and in the present study we examine the role of the leucine zipper motif located in the C - terminal coiled - coil domain in mediating the homotypic association of p57 / coronin - 1 . Recombinant p57 / coronin - 1 protein in solution formed a homo - dimer , as analysed by Superose 12 column chromatography and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation . In vivo , a truncated form consisting of the C - terminal coiled - coil domain co - pre - cipitated with full - length p57 / coronin - 1 when both were co - ex - pressed in COS - 1 cells . A chimaeric construct composed of the C - terminal domain of p57 / coronin - 1 ( which lacks the actin - binding sites ) fused with green ﬂuorescent protein co - localized with cortical F - actin - rich regions in COS - 1 cells only when full - length p57 / coronin - 1 was expressed simultaneously in the cells , suggesting that the C - terminal region is required for the homo - typic association of p57 / coronin - 1 . Furthermore , p57LZ , a poly - peptide consisting of the C - terminal 90 amino acid residues of p57 / coronin - 1 , was sufﬁcient for dimerization . When two leucine residues out of the four that constitute the leucine zipper structure in p57LZ or full - length p57 were replaced with alanine residues , the mutants failed to form homodimers . Taken together , these results demonstrate that p57 / coronin - 1 forms homodimers , that the association is mediated by the leucine zipper structure in the C - terminal region , and that it plays a role in the cross - linking of F - actin in the cell . Key words : actin - binding protein , coiled - coil domain , coronin , homodimer , leucine zipper . INTRODUCTION Actin - binding proteins participate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during chemotaxis , phagocytosis , degranulation and cellular signalling [ 1 – 5 ] and thus are essential for normal leuco - cyte function . We previously identiﬁed p57 / coronin - 1 , an actin - binding protein that is selectively expressed in immune cells [ 6 ] and shares sequence identity with coronin , an actin - binding protein puriﬁed from the actomyosin complex of Dictyostelium discoideum [ 7 ] . Coronin localizes at intracellular sites of active reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , such as the lamelli - podium , phagocytic cup and contractile ring in Dictyostelium , and has thus been assigned an important functional role in mi - gration , phagocytosis and cell division [ 8 – 14 ] . Homologues of coronin have been identiﬁed in many eukaryotes from yeasts to mammals [ 15 ] , consistent with its important function in cell biology . Whereas lower eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium and Saccharomyces possessonlyoneisoform , atleastﬁvehomologues have been identiﬁed in humans [ 15 , 16 ] ; these are currently de - signated coronin - 1 to - 5 , and constitute collectively the coronin protein family . The differential tissue distribution of speciﬁc fam - ily members implies a selective and tissue - speciﬁc function for each isotype . For example , immune cell - speciﬁc p57 / coronin - 1 plays a crucial role in phagolysosome formation in leucocytes [ 17 ] . Successful intracellular parasitism of murine macrophages by mycobacteria has been linked to organism - dependent modu - lation of p57 / coronin - 1 [ 18 ] . Most coronin protein family members , including p57 / cor - onin - 1 , contain 450 – 500 amino acid residues and share common structural features , such as ﬁve WD ( Trp - Asp ) repeats located at the centre of the molecule and a coiled - coil domain at the C - ter - minus . Our previous report demonstrated that p57 / coronin - 1 pos - sesses two actin - binding sites , one located in the N - terminal region and the other within the WD repeats , and that each also con - tains a cluster of basic amino acids [ 19 ] . The coiled - coil domain of p57 / coronin - 1 includes a so - called leucine zipper motif , with four leucine residues that appear every seven amino acid residues [ 6 ] . Because the leucine zipper motif is not found in other mam - malian coronin members [ 16 , 20 – 24 ] , we reasoned that it may serve a function unique to p57 / coronin - 1 , and tested the hypo - thesis that the leucine zipper motif mediates homodimer formation .

( Tokyo , Japan ) and Wako Pure Chemicals ( Osaka , Japan ) respectively . Oligonucleo - tides were supplied by Amersham - Pharmacia Biotech ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Antibodies Two antibodies against human p57 / coronin - 1 were used in the pre - sent study : a monoclonal antibody ( N7 ) that recognizes the C - terminal region of human p57 / coronin - 1 [ 25 ] , and a rabbit poly - clonal antibody that recognizes the N - terminal 20 amino residues of human p57 / coronin - 1 [ 19 ] .

A His - tagged p57FL construct was also prepared by the insertion of the p57FL cDNA into the BamHI / SalI site of a pQE - 32 vector ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . Muta - tions were introduced into the leucine zipper motif of p57LZ and p57FL by using a QuickChange TM site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , U . S . A . ) according to the manu - facturer’s instructions . pGEX - p57LZ [ AALL ] and pQE - p57FL - [ AALL ] ( in which Leu - 433 and Leu - 440 of p57 / coronin - 1 are replaced with Ala ) were generated from pGEX - p57LZ and pQE - p57FL respectively , by using the primers 5 (cid:2) - CGTGTCTCGGG - CGGAGGAGGAGATGCGGAAGGCCCAGGCCACGGTGCA - GG - 3 (cid:2) ( sense ) and 5 (cid:2) - CCGTGGCCTGGGCCTTCCGCATCTC - CTCCTCCGCCCGAGACACGGCATCC - 3 (cid:2) ( antisense ) . p57LZ - [ AAAA ] ( in which Leu - 433 , Leu - 440 , Leu - 447 and Leu - 454 are replaced with Ala ) was prepared using pGEX - p57LZ [ AALL ] as a template and the primers 5 (cid:2) - CGGTGCAGGAGGCCCAGAAGC - GCTTGGACAGGGCGGAGGAGACAGTCCAG - 3 (cid:2) ( sense ) and 5 (cid:2) - CTGTCTCCTCCGCCCTGTCCAAGCGCTTCTGGGCCT - CCTGCACCGTGGC - 3 (cid:2) ( antisense ) .

Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins Thefollowingrecombinantproteinswereproducedin Escherichia coli ( JM109 or DH5 α ) as fusion proteins with GST ( glutathione S - transferase ) : p57FL ( Met - 1 to Lys - 461 ) , p57WD ( Met - 1 to Asp - 371 ) , p57LZ ( Pro - 372 to Lys - 461 ) , p57LZ [ AAAA ] , and p57LZ [ AALL ] . The transformed E . coli grown to exponential phase was cultured further in TB medium [ 500 ml ; 12 g / l tryp - tone , 24 g / l yeast extract , 0 . 4 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 17 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 72 mM K 2 HPO 4 ] containing 0 . 5 mM IPTG at 20 ◦ C for 16 h [ 19 ] . The cells were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in 30 ml of sonication buffer ( 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 . 0 , containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA ) , and lysozyme was added to the suspension to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 . 0 mg / ml . After the mixture was incubated at 4 ◦ C for 20 min , the cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 15000 g for 30 min . The supernatant was mixed with glutathione – Sepharose 4B beads ( 0 . 5 ml of a 50 % suspension ) , and the mixture was incubated at 4 ◦ C for 30 minwithoccasionalstirring . Afterwashingthebeadsﬁvetimes with sonication buffer to remove unbound proteins , recombinant proteins were recovered by treatment of the washed beads with Factor Xa under conditions as follows : fusion protein - bound glutathione – Sepharose 4B was suspended in 0 . 5 ml of 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , containing 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 and 40 units / ml Factor Xa protease ( Qiagen ) and incubated at 22 ◦ C for 16 h . The recombinant wild - type and mutated full - length p57 / coro - nin - 1 proteins were also puriﬁed from the culture medium of E . coli transformed with pQE - p57FL [ LLLL ] and pQE - p57FL - [ AALL ] respectively . The E . coli cell pellet obtained from 300 ml of culture [ LB ( Luria – Bertani ) medium containing 0 . 5 mM IPTG ] at 37 ◦ C for 3 h was disrupted by sonication , and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 15000 g for 30 min . The recombinant proteins were puriﬁed by afﬁnity chro - matography on a column of anti - p57 / coronin - 1 antibody ( N7 ) conjugated on HiTrap TM NHS ( N - hydroxysuccinimide ) - activated HP ( Amersham Biosciences ) . The purity of the recombinant pro - teins was found to be > 95 % , as checked by SDS / PAGE followed by the silver staining method . Gel chromatographic analysis Recombinant p57 / coronin - 1 solutions ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 mg / ml ; 0 . 1 ml ) were separated by gel chromatography on a column of Superose 12 10 / 300 GL ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , containing 140 mM NaCl . The elution was performed with the same buffer at a ﬂow rate of 0 . 5 ml / min at room temperature . Fractions of 0 . 5 ml were collected , and each fraction was analysed by immunoblotting using anti - p57 / coronin - 1 antibody [ 19 ] . The molecular mass markers used were : thyroglobulin ( 670 kDa ) , IgG ( 158 kDa ) , BSA ( 67 kDa ) , c (cid:1) 2005 Biochemical Society Dimerization of p57 / coronin - 1 via a leucine zipper motif 327 ovalbumin ( 44 kDa ) , myoglobin ( 17 kDa ) and vitamin B 12 ( 1 . 35 kDa ) . Electrophoresis and immunoblotting SDS / PAGE was conducted in 10 – 20 % ( w / v ) polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0 . 1 % SDS [ 26 ] . The separated proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a semi - dry blotting system ( Bio - Craft , Tokyo , Japan ) using transfer buffer [ 5 . 82 g / l Tris , 2 . 93 g / l glycine , 0 . 39 g / l SDS , 20 % ( v / v ) methanol ] at 1 . 6 mA / cm 2 for 45 min . After blocking with a milk protein - based reagent ( BlockAce TM ; Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co . , Osaka , Japan ) for 20 min , the membranes were treated suc - cessively with anti - p57 / coronin - 1 monoclonal antibody ( N7 ; 5 µ g / ml ) or polyclonal antibody ( dilution of 1 : 100 ) for 1 h , and then with a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary anti - body ( dilution of 1 : 1000 to 1 : 5000 ) for 30 min . The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ® ; Amersham Biosciences ) . Transient expression of p57 / coronin - 1 in COS - 1 cells COS - 1 cells ( A . T . C . C . ) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco BRL ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( Gibco BRL ) at 37 ◦ C under humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 . The plasmids encoding p57 / coronin - 1 and its deletion mutants were introduced into COS - 1 cells by electroporation . Brieﬂy , COS - 1 cells ( 3 . 5 × 10 6 cells / 0 . 7 ml ) in PBS were mixed with 40 µ g of plasmid DNA . The mixture was transferred into a 0 . 4 cm electrode gap electroporation cuvette and subjected to a single pulse of 300 V at a capacitance of 975 µ F ( Gene Pulser Xcell TM ; Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , U . S . A . ) . The cell suspension was diluted with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium con - taining 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum and cultured at 37 ◦ C for 48 h . Immunoprecipitation COS - 1 cells ( 3 . 5 × 10 6 cells ) transiently expressing p57 / cor - onin - 1 were incubated with 1 . 0 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , containing 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 µ g / ml aprotinin and 1 mM PMSF ) at 4 ◦ C for 30 min , and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15000 g for 10 min . The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 50 µ l of Protein G – Sepharose ( 50 % suspension ) at 4 ◦ C for 1 h with gentle shaking . After the suspension was centrifuged at 3300 g for 3 min , the supernatant was mixed with 20 µ l of Protein G – Sepharose and 20 µ l of anti - p57 / coronin - 1 polyclonal antibody ( N - terminal speciﬁc ) , and the mixture was incubated at 4 ◦ C for 16 h . Protein G – Sepharose beads were then washed ﬁve times with lysis buffer to remove unbound proteins . Proteins bound to the beads were recovered by treatment with a sample buffer for SDS / PAGE at 95 ◦ C for 5 min . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy COS - 1 cells that had been transfected with plasmids containing a gene for EGFP were cultured on a Lab - Tek II Chamber Slide ( Nalge Nunc , Rochester , NY , U . S . A . ) at 37 ◦ C for 48 h and ﬁxed with 3 . 8 % neutral buffered formaldehyde ( Wako Pure Chem - icals ) . For the analysis of localization of F - actin ( ﬁlamentous ac - tin ) , the cells were then permeabilized by treatment with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature , washed with PBS , and incubated with rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( 15 units / ml ) in PBS containing 3 % ( w / v ) BSA for 30 min . Fluorescently labelled cells were washed three times with PBS and then mounted with 2 . 3 % ( v / v ) 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo - 2 , 2 , 2 - octane ( Sigma ) containing 90 % ( v / v ) glycerol on glass slides . Fluor - escent images were analysed with a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Radiance 2100 ; Bio - Rad ) . Fluorescence in the green and red channels was visualized using the 488 nm ( argon laser ) and 543 nm ( helium / neon laser ) laser lines respectively . Images were collected with non - saturating conditions set - up by the use of an output LUT ( look - up table ) . Sucrose density gradient centrifugation Solutions of recombinant p57FL [ LLLL ] and p57FL [ AALL ] ( approx . 0 . 5 mg / ml ; 0 . 2 ml ) were loaded on to the top of a 12 ml linear 5 – 20 % ( w / v ) sucrose gradient in buffer comprising 40 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 M NaCl , 0 . 2 mM EDTA and 0 . 02 % Nonidet P - 40 . Centrifugation was conducted at 150000 g with a Hitachi P40ST rotor ( Hitachi , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) for 18 h at 4 ◦ C , and fractions of 1 . 0 ml were collected . An aliquot of each fraction was analysed by SDS / PAGE followed by immuno - blotting using polyclonal anti - p57 / coronin - 1 antibody . Native p57 / coronin - 1 endogenously expressed in human HL60 pro - myelocytic leukaemia cells was analysed in an identical fashion . HL60 cells were lysed as described above for immunoprecipi - tations and separated by centrifugation on a sucrose density grad - ient . Fractions were separated by SDS / PAGE and probed for p57 / coronin - 1 by immunoblotting . RESULTS Analysis of molecular size of recombinant p57 / coronin - 1 by gel chromatography We separated human p57 / coronin - 1 produced in E . coli by gel chromatography on a Superose 12 column to assess its molecular size . p57FL eluted from the chromatography column in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of 90 – 110 kDa ( Figure 1B ) , rather than the predicted mass of 57 kDa , suggesting that recombi - nant p57 / coronin - 1 formed homodimers . The sequence of p57 / coronin - 1 contains both WD repeats and a coiled - coil domain containing a leucine zipper motif ( Figure 1A ) , each of which can mediate protein – protein interactions and thus are potential parti - cipants in homodimer formation . To distinguish if these motifs are responsible for dimerization of the recombinant p57 / coronin - 1 , we prepared two truncated forms , p57WD ( amino acid residues 1 – 371 , including ﬁve WD repeats ) and p57LZ ( amino acid residues 372 – 461 , including a coiled - coil domain with a leucine zipper motif ) ( Figure 1A ) , and analysed their elution proﬁles after separation by gel chromatography . p57WD was eluted in a fraction that corresponded to a molecular mass of 35 – 45 kDa ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with its being a monomer compactly folded due to the WD repeats . On the other hand , p57LZ was recovered in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of 20 – 25 kDa , approximately twice the size predicted ( ∼ 11 kDa ) based on its sequence , consistent with it being a dimer . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that recombinant p57 / coronin - 1 formed a homodimer and that the C - terminal 90 amino acids were responsible for dimerization . Homotypic association of p57 / coronin - 1 in COS - 1 cells To determine if p57FL and p57LZ associate physically in intact cells , we expressed the constructs in COS - 1 cells and assessed their interactions immunochemically . For these studies we utilized two anti - p57 / coronin - 1 antibodies : an antibody recognizing the N - terminal 20 amino acids of p57 / coronin - 1 to perform im - munoprecipitation , and an antibody recognizing the C - terminal region of p57 / coronin - 1 ( N7 ) to probe p57FL and p57LZ on blotted membranes . The N - terminal - speciﬁc antibody precipit - ated p57FL , but not p57LZ , when COS - 1 cells were transfected c (cid:1) 2005 Biochemical Society 328 T . Oku and others Figure2 Homotypicinteractionofp57 / coronin - 1mediatedbyitsC - terminal region COS - 1 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding p57FL alone , p57LZ alone , or both . Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using an antibody that selectively recognizes the C - terminal region of p57 / coronin - 1 ( right panel ) . Immunoprecipitates by antibody recognizing the N - terminal region of p57 / coronin - 1 were analysed by immunoblotting using an antibody speciﬁc for the C - terminal region of p57 / coronin - 1 ( left panel ) . separately with either p57FL or p57LZ cDNA ( Figure 2 , left panel ) , consistent with the absence from p57LZ of the N - terminal sequence . We detected no band corresponding to p57FL in im - munoprecipitates from either p57LZ - transfected ( Figure 2 , left panel ) or untransfected ( results not shown ) COS - 1 cells , indi - cating that these cells do not constitutively express p57 / coronin - 1 . By contrast , when the cells were co - transfected with p57FL and p57LZ cDNAs , p57LZ ( molecular mass 11 kDa ) was co - precipi - tated with p57FL ( molecular mass 57 kDa ) by the N - terminal - speciﬁc antibody ( Figure 2 , left panel ) . Failure to recover p57LZ in the singly transfected cells did not reﬂect the absence of protein , as the expression of p57FL and p57LZ after each cDNA trans - fection was conﬁrmed by SDS / PAGE followed by immunoblot - ting ( Figure 2 , right panel ) . These results strongly suggest that p57LZ was physically associated with p57FL in COS - 1 cells . We next analysed the intracellular distribution of p57LZ after co - transfection of p57FL and p57LZ cDNAs into COS - 1 cells . For this purpose , we prepared a construct in which p57LZ cDNA was ligated with a vector containing the EGFP gene . The chimaeric fusion protein ( EGFP – p57LZ ) was expressed in COS - 1 cells and the transfected cells were examined using confocal laser - scan - ning microscopy . EGFP – p57LZ was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm after transfection with pEGFP – p57LZ alone ( Figure 3 , upper panels ) . In contrast , when EGFP – p57LZ and p57FL were expressed simultaneously in COS - 1 cells , EGFP – p57LZ was , at least in part , localized in the F - actin - rich cortical region of the cell ( Figure 3 , lower panels ) . The intracellular distribution of EGFP – p57LZ after the co - transfection was similar to that of p57FL expressed in COS - 1 cells as assessed by immunoﬂuorescence in our previous study [ 19 ] . Co - localization of F - actin and EGFP – p57LZ , aconstructdevoidofactin - bindingsites , suggestsphysical interaction between EGFP – p57LZ and p57FL . These results supporttheconclusionthattheC - terminalregionofp57 / coronin - 1 mediates its homotypic association . Furthermore , the failure of EGFP – p57LZ to associate with F - actin - rich subcellular compart - ments after the single transfection indicates that the coronin species endogenous to COS - 1 cells did not associate with the tagged construct . Dimerization of p57 / coronin - 1 via leucine zipper motifs The sequence of the coiled - coil domain at the C - terminus of p57 / coronin - 1 contains four leucine residues that appear every seven amino acid residues , a structural unit known as a leucine zipper motif ( Figure 4A ) [ 27 – 29 ] . When the sequence is arranged in α - helical heptad repeats as shown in Figure 4 ( B ) , the leu - cine residues at position ‘d’ as well as valine , leucine and methionine residues at position ‘a’ form a hydrophobic surface . To examine a role of the leucine zipper motif in the dimerization of p57 / coronin - 1 , we expressed in E . coli the mutant pro - tein p57LZ with replacement of these speciﬁc leucine residues : p57LZ [ AAAA ] ( Leu - 433 , Leu - 440 , Leu - 447 , and Leu - 454 replaced with Ala ) and p57LZ [ AALL ] ( Leu - 433 and Leu - 440 re - placed with Ala ) . Under chromatography conditions identical to Figure 3 Intracellular localization of EGFP – p57LZ expressed in COS - 1 cells EGFP – p57LZ was transiently expressed in COS - 1 cells after transfection with pEGFP – p57LZ alone ( upper panels ) or co - transfection of pEGFP – p57LZ and the cDNA for p57FL in pcDNA3 . 1 - V5 - His ( lower panels ) . Fluorescent images were observed 48h after the transfection with a confocal laser - scanning microscope .

Eachfractionwasanalysed bySDS / PAGEfollowedbyimmunoblottingwithanti - p57 / coronin - 1antibody ( p57LZ [ LLLL ] and p57LZ [ AALL ] ) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining ( p57LZ [ AAAA ] ) . those used previously , both p57LZ [ AAAA ] and p57LZ [ AALL ] were retarded in their elution pattern when compared with wild - type p57LZ ( p57LZ [ LLLL ] ) ( Figure 4C ) . Whereas the wild - type construct eluted with a molecular mass of 22 kDa , consistent with it being dimeric , the elution positions of the mutants cor - responded to a monomeric form of p57LZ ( molecular mass 11 kDa ) , suggesting that mutation of the leucine zipper motif results in failure of homodimer formation of p57 / coronin - 1 . We next examined the effects of site - directed mutation of full - length p57 / coronin - 1 with regard to its capacity to form dimers . A mutant containing substitution of Ala residues for Leu - 433 and Leu - 440 , p57FL [ AALL ] , was chromatographed on a Superose 12 10 / 300 GL column and each fraction was analysed by SDS / PAGE and immunoblotting ( Figure 5A ) . The mutant p57FL - [ AALL ] showed a retarded elution time as compared with wild - type p57FL [ LLLL ] . When proteins were monitored by A 280 , p57FL [ LLLL ] and p57FL [ AALL ] were eluted at 23 . 85 min and 25 . 58 min respectively . Based on the calibration curve with stand - ard proteins , the molecular masses of these proteins were estim - ated to be approx . 110 kDa for p57FL [ LLLL ] and approx . 55 kDa for p57FL [ AALL ] ( Figure 5B ) . The estimated molecular masses of these proteins strongly suggested that p57FL [ LLLL ] formed a homodimer , but that p57FL [ AALL ] remained as a monomer . The differential ability of p57FL [ LLLL ] and p57FL [ AALL ] to dimerize was conﬁrmed by sucrose density gradient centrifuga - tion followed by SDS / PAGE and immunoblotting ( Figure 5C ) . The bulk of the mutant protein p57FL [ AALL ] sedimented in lower - density fractions as compared with wild - type p57FL - [ LLLL ] . When the lysate of HL60 cells was applied to sucrose density centrifugation under the same conditions , p57 / coronin - 1 was recovered in identical fractions to the recombinant p57FL - [ LLLL ] . Furthermore , we conducted a pull - down assay , using an approach similar to the experiment shown in Figure 2 , by using the mutant p57FL [ AALL ] instead of p57FL [ LLLL ] . However , the N - terminal - speciﬁc antibody did not co - precipitate wild - type p57LZ [ LLLL ] after COS - 1 cells had been transfected with both p57FL [ AALL ] and p57LZ [ LLLL ] cDNA ( results not shown ) . These results suggest that p57 / coronin - 1 forms homo - Figure 5 Effects of mutations in the leucine zipper motif of p57 / coronin - 1 on homodimer formation ( A ) Wild - typep57FL [ LLLL ] andthemutantp57FL [ AALL ] werechromatographedonaSuperose 12 10 / 300GL column , and an aliquot of each fraction ( 0 . 5ml ) was analysed by SDS / PAGE and immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti - p57 / coronin - 1 antibody .

DISCUSSION Since the expression of p57 / coronin - 1 is restricted to immune cells , we reasoned that this protein participates in cellular events that are integral for normal leucocyte responses , such as phago - cytosis , chemotaxis and signal transduction via actin reorgan - ization . During phagosome maturation , p57 / coronin - 1 associates transiently with nascent phagosomes , co - incident with F - actin and with the same kinetics [ 17 , 25 ] . Furthermore , translocation of p57 / coronin - 1 is regulated by protein kinase C - mediated phos - phorylation [ 17 ] , as inhibitors of protein kinase C prevent the dis - sociation of p57 / coronin - 1 and F - actin from the periphagosome and subsequent phagosome – lysosome fusion . Taken together , these observations suggest that p57 / coronin - 1 contributes to the reorganization of the periphagosomal F - actin network during phagocytosis . In the present study , we assessed the multimerization of p57 / coronin - 1 both in solution and in cells by employing isolated recombinant proteins and cDNA transfection of COS - 1 cells . c (cid:1) 2005 Biochemical Society 330 T . Oku and others When separated by gel chromatography on a Superose 12 column and by sucrose density centrifugation , p57 / coronin - 1 behaved like a homodimer . Furthermore , the isolated C - terminal region , consisting almost exclusively of the coiled - coil domain ( p57LZ ) , was sufﬁcient to support dimer formation ( Figure 1 ) , implicating that domain in mediating homodimer formation by the holo - protein . Homodimer formation was not a property restricted to recombinant proteins in solution , but occurred in vivo as well . As assessed by co - immunoprecipitation and by ﬂuorescence microscopy , thehomotypicassociationofp57 / coronin - 1mediated by the C - terminal region was also observed in COS - 1 cells after expression of p57FL and its truncated forms ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Moreover , mutation of at least two leucine residues in the leucine zipper motif of p57LZ and p57FL caused failure of dimer formation ( Figures 4 and 5 ) , thus indicating that the leucine zipper motif is essential for dimer formation . It is most likely that the homotypic association is mediated by hydrophobic interaction between the surface formed on one side of the C - terminal coiled - coil domain of each polypeptide , with four leucine residues that are present in position ‘d’ of the α - helical heptad structure and hydrophobic amino acid ( valine , leucine and methionine ) residues in position ‘a’ ( Figure 4B ) . Although most members of the coronin protein family contain coiled - coil domains in their C - terminal regions [ 15 ] , and this domain has been suggested to be involved in homotypic multimer formation , p57 / coronin - 1 is the ﬁrst mammalian coronin , to our knowledge , that has been demonstrated to form a homodimer . Human coronin - 3 forms a homotypic oligomer [ 21 ] , although gel chromatographic analysis indicates that it is a higher - ordered oligomer than that formed by p57 / coronin - 1 , and its oligomer - ization seems to be heterogeneous , with the molecular mass of most of this protein estimated to be 150 – 200 kDa . Coronin - 3 is therefore thought to form trimeric or tetrameric oligomers rather than dimers [ 21 ] , an organization likely to reﬂect more complex interactions between the N - terminal and C - terminal regions . Dif - ferences in intermolecular associations among members of the coronin family of proteins may reﬂect in part structural poly - morphisms within their C - terminal regions . Among mammalian coronins , only p57 / coronin - 1 possesses a leucine zipper motif in the coiled - coil domain , and this feature is highly conserved among several species , including human , bovine and mouse [ 6 , 18 ] . The homotypic dimer formation of p57 / coronin - 1 via a leucine zipper structure appears to be rather stable , as the dimer did not dissociate under various stringent buffer conditions ( e . g . non - ionic detergents , chaotropic ions and high ionic strength ) ( T . Oku , S . Itoh , R . Ishii and T . Tsuji , unpublished work ) . Schematically , the overall structure of p57 / coronin - 1 can be represented as a V - shaped homodimeric structure , with each polypeptide chain with an interconnecting domain including a leucine zipper motif at the C - terminus and two actin - binding sites near the N - terminus [ 19 ] ( Figure 6 ) . Such a domain organization for p57 / coronin - 1 resembles that of ﬁlamin , another actin - binding protein [ 30 ] . These actin - binding proteins have a domain structure that is well suited for cross - linking or bundling of F - actin . Filamin is , in fact , known to promote the gelation of actin ﬁlament solutions [ 31 ] . Among the coronin family of proteins , for example , Crn1p from yeast promotes the assembly of actin ﬁlaments and cross - linking of ﬁlaments into bundles [ 32 ] , although its oligomeric structure is not known . It is likely that each member of the coronin protein family adopts a speciﬁc oligomeric structure especially tailored to its function . Members of the coronin protein family have at least one method of homodimer formation that is independent of the leucine zipper . A non - mammalian coronin isolated from Xenopus oocytes ( Xcoronin ) , which lacks a leucine zipper motif , also forms a homodimer [ 33 ] . It is likely that protein domains in Figure 6 Schematic representation of the structure of p57 / coronin - 1 p57 / coronin - 1 forms a homodimer , which is supported by a leucine zipper motif ( L ) located at theC - terminusofeachpolypeptidechain . Actin - bindingsitesarelocatedattheN - terminusand within WD repeats , which are organized into a β - propeller structure [ 19 ] . Xcoronin substitute functionally for the leucine zipper motif in supporting dimer formation [ 34 ] . In conclusion , our data demonstrate that p57 / coronin - 1 formed a homodimer , mediated by a leucine zipper motif in the C - ter - minal region , both in a cell - free system with recombinant pro - teins in solution and in COS - 1 cells . Among members of the coronin protein family , dimer formation is a property unique to p57 / coronin - 1 , and thus is likely to participate in specialized cellular functions , such as the reorganization of the actin cyto - skeleton during phagocytosis by immune cells . Elucidation of the mechanism for the cross - linking or bundling of actin ﬁlaments by p57 / coronin - 1 homodimers and its regulation during phagocytosis will provide insight into the cell biology underlying a fundamental and essential activity of cells in the innate immune system .
