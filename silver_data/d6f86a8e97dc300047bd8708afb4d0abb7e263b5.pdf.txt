Introduction Compared to timely access to healthcare , delaying or forgoing healthcare is associated with unfavorable health - related outcomes , such as higher severity of disease , decreased quality of life , increased risk of hospitalization , and longer hospital stays ( Chen et al . , 2011 ; Weissman et al . , 1991 ) . Delaying or forgoing healthcare may lead to higher medical costs ( Weissman et al . , 1991 ) . There are various reasons to forgo healthcare , but cost is a major one ( Bazin et al . , 2006 ; Briesacher et al . , 2007 ; Law et al . , 2012 ) . The importance of cost as a risk factor for forgoing healthcare seems to have increased in the recent economic downturn ( Rustgi , et al . , 2009 ) . Little is known about the forgoing of healthcare for economic reasons in Switzerland . Swiss national and regional estimates of the overall prevalence of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons varied between 15 % and 18 % ( OECD , 2011a ; Wolff et al . , 2011 ) , with notable variation by income ( Wolff et al . , 2011 ) . Health insurance is compulsory for all citizens in Switzerland and insurance premiums are paid independently of income . Health insur - ance covers the costs of medical treatment and hospitalization for the insured . The insured person pays part of the cost of treatment : an an - nual ﬂ at deductible , called the franchise , chosen by the insured per - son ( with premiums adjusted accordingly ) and a 10 % co - pay of the costs upto a stop - lossannualamount of CHF 700 ( 1CHF ≈ 1 $ ) . Between 1999 and 2010 , health insurance premiums increased by 77 % , coupled with increasing out - of - pocket payments . Increasing out - of - pocket spending may , at least in some settings , reduce the use of clinically im - portant services and drugs to prevent the onset and progression of chronic disease ( Paez et al . , 2009 ) . We aimed to determine the characteristics of participants who re - port forgoing healthcare and to describe the past 4 - year trend of for - going healthcare for economic reasons .

Subjects are selected independently throughout each year to represent the canton ' s non - institutionalized resi - dents aged 35 to 74 years . Eligible subjects are identi ﬁ ed using a list of resi - dents established by the local government . This listing includes all potential eligible participants except persons living illegally in the country . Strati ﬁ ed ran - dom sampling is used to select participants by gender within each 10 - year age stratum , selectinganumberofparticipantsthatisproportionaltothecorrespond - ing population distribution . Each participant receives several self - administered , standardized questionnaires . There are no language restrictions , as long as the participants are able to understand and answer the questionnaires . The 2007 – 2010 participation rates varied between 58 % and 68 % . The participants from the four waves of the annual surveys were com - bined and used as the surveyed population , except in the estimation of the annual trends . The Bus Santé study was approved by the ethical research committee of the Geneva University Hospitals . Variables Forgoing healthcare for economic reasons Participantswereasked , “ Duringtheprevious12 months , haveyouforgone any healthcare for economic reasons ? ” Participants speci ﬁ ed the type of healthcare forgone , if any . For the present analyses , forgone healthcare was classi ﬁ ed into six categories : devices ( e . g . , glasses , hearing devices ) , healthcare providerconsultation ( with a generalistorspecialist physician ) , surgery , dental health , medication , andother . Becauseoftheirlowprevalence , in - hospitalreha - bilitation and home care were included in the “ other ” category . Cardiovascular disease and risk factors Cardiovasculardisease ( CVD ) and risk factors wereassessedand de ﬁ ned by af ﬁ rmative answers to both of the following questions : “ Have you ever been told that you had diabetes / highblood pressure / high cholesterol / myocardial in - farction or angina / arterial thrombosis ? If so , are you taking a drug for it ? ” Smoking was de ﬁ ned as current smoking . Obesity was de ﬁ ned as a measured body mass index ≥ 30 kg / m 2 . Demographics and socioeconomic reasons Participants were grouped by age : b 45 years , 45 – 64 years , and ≥ 65 years . CitizenshipwascategorizedasSwissornon - Swiss . Informationonmaritalstatus and dependent children at home ( age b 15 years ) was collected . Occupation ( white collar and independent workers versus salaried blue collar workers ) , ed - ucation level ( high [ ≥ 13 years ] and low [ b 13 years ] ) , and monthly household income ( b CHF 3000 / month , 3000 – 4999 , 5000 – 6999 , 7000 – 9499 , 9500 – 12999 , ≥ 13000 ) were used to characterize socioeconomic status . Insurance status Self - reported deductible was grouped into 1 of 3 categories ( CHF ≤ 500 , 1000 – 1500 and ≥ 2000 ) . Participants were also asked whether they had com - plementary health insurance and whether they received a premium subsidy from the state . Health services utilization and self - reported health status ( SRHS ) It has been suggested that subjective indicators of forgone healthcare should be combined with objective measures ( Allin and Masseria , 2009 ; Allin et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , to estimate the association between forgoing healthcare and the use of health services , information on the use of ambula - tory and inpatient services in the same previous 12 - month period was in - cluded . In the Bus Santé study , participants aged ≥ 50 years self - rated their health status ( SRHS ) by answering the following question : “ How do you con - sider your current health : very poor , poor , fair , good , very good ? ” Statistical analyses The means and frequencies of study variables were calculated . Analyses were performed using Student ' s t - tests or ANOVA for continuous data and chi - square tests for categorical data . The Cochran – Armitage trend test was used to test trends across survey periods . The Cochran – Armitage test checks for a trend in binomial proportions across levels of a single factor . Logistic re - gression models were used to test associations between forgoing healthcare and study variables . To test for temporal trends in multivariate analyses , sur - vey year×covariate products were computed for each covariate of interest , and the product terms were entered in the regression models as independent variables . p - Values of such interaction terms were used to determine whether the association between a given covariate and forgoing healthcare changed overtime . All p - valueswere2 - tailedwithsigni ﬁ cancesetat b 0 . 05 ( b 0 . 10forin - teraction test ) . All analyses were performed using SAS software ( SAS Institute , Inc . , Cary , North Carolina ) . Results A total of 2601 subjects ( 50 % women ) were included in the analy - sis ( Table 1 ) . The overall mean age was 51 . 8 years ( SD , 11 . 0 ) . The numbers of participants for each survey year were as follows : 695 ( 26 . 7 % ) in 2007 / 8 , 978 ( 37 . 6 % ) in 2009 , and 928 ( 35 . 7 % ) in 2010 . Only participants for whom all variables of interest were available were included ( 92 . 5 % of the overall 2007 – 2010 cohort ) . The preva - lence of the different characteristics considered was stable across sur - vey years . Table 2 reports the characteristic - speci ﬁ c prevalence values and the univariate associations of forgoing healthcare for economic rea - sons . The forgoing of healthcare for economic reasons was associated with gender , education , household monthly income , CVD , smoking status , and occupation . With respect to marital status , divorced par - ticipants who were not living with a partner had the highest preva - lence of forgoing healthcare . Participants with dependent children at home had forgone healthcare more frequently than participants without dependent children . Participants with complementary health insurance were less likely to forgo healthcare than participants without such complementary insurance . The prevalence of forgoing healthcare was higher in the presence of premium subsidies than in their absence . Among participants aged ≥ 50 years , 0 . 5 % , 24 . 0 % , 55 . 3 % , 17 . 5 % , and 2 . 7 % considered their current health very poor , poor , fair , good , and very good , respectively . The prevalence of forgoing healthcare de - creased as SRHS improved . The adjusted odds of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons by speci ﬁ c characteristics are given in Table 2 . Women were more likely than men to forgo healthcare . The odds of forgoing healthcare increased with decreasing monthly household incomes ( p for trends b 0 . 05 ) . Cur - rent smokers , participants with CV comorbidities , those with dependent children at home , and divorced participants living without a partner were more likely to forgo healthcare than other participants were . Higher franchise amounts were associated with forgoing healthcare . Having complementary health insurance decreased the risk of forgoing healthcare , whereas receiving premium subsidy increased it . Ambulato - ry or inpatient health services utilization had no association with forgo - ing healthcare . Amongparticipantsaged ≥ 50 years , poorSRHSwassigni ﬁ cantlyas - sociated with forgoing healthcare for economic reasons . However , ex - cept for ambulatory healthcare use which was lower in patients forgoing care , taking into account SRHS did not meaningfully change the associations between other characteristics and forgoing healthcare among participants aged ≥ 50 years ( Table 3 ) . Overall , the prevalence of forgoing healthcare remained stable ( 13 % – 14 % , p = 0 . 93 ) between 2007 and 2010 . Survey year interactions were only statistically signi ﬁ cant for having dependent children ( P interaction = 0 . 08 ) and approached signi ﬁ cance for income ( P interaction = 0 . 11 ) . Among participants without dependent chil - dren at home , the prevalence of forgoing healthcare decreased from 14 . 5 % in 2007 / 8 to 12 . 0 % in 2009 and to 11 . 7 % in 2010 , whereas the prevalence increased from 13 . 1 % to 17 . 1 % and to 17 . 2 % among partici - pants with dependent children during the same period . Among partici - pants with a monthly household income b 3000CHF , the prevalence increased from 22 . 5 % in 2007 / 8 to 32 . 7 % in 2009 and to 34 . 7 % in 2010 ( P for trends = 0 . 22 ) , while it decreased among participants with a monthly household income ≥ 3000CHF and remained stable among participants with an income ≥ 13 , 000CHF ( Fig . 1 ) . Between 2007 – 2010 , various types of care were forgone for econom - ic reasons : dental care ( 75 . 1 % ) , devices ( 25 . 7 % ) , specialist consultation 522 I . Guessous et al . / Preventive Medicine 55 ( 2012 ) 521 – 527 ( 25 . 4 % ) , generalist consultation ( 14 . 5 % ) , medication ( 12 . 1 % ) , and sur - gery ( 5 . 8 % ) . These distributions remained stable across survey years ( Table S1 ) . Discussion Using population - based data from an urban region with universal health insurance coverage , we found that forgoing healthcare for eco - nomic reasons was frequently reported ; one out of seven participants had forgone healthcare for economic reasons in the past 12 months . Monthly household income had a linear association with the for - going of healthcare for economic reasons . This association has been reported in other European countries , where income inequality is low ( e . g . , Sweden ) compared to other settings ( Mielck et al . , 2009 ) . Among participants aged ≥ 50 years , the magnitude of the association decreased after adjusting for SRHS , but compared to the highestincome group ( ≥ 13 , 000CHF ) , participants with lower income remained 2 to 5 times more likely to forgo healthcare for economic reasons . Thus , the adjusted association between income and forgoing healthcare persisted despite universal insurance coverage . A weakness of the Swiss health insurance model , which is criticized by the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ( OECD ) , is that the health insurance premiums are independent of income ( OECD , 2011b ) . In countries with universal health insurance systems in which premiums or out - of - pocket participation are not proportional to income , people with low incomes still pay disproportionately more than people with high incomes . The global ﬁ nancial crisis of 2008 and resulting economic down - turn in 2009 stalled demand for exports and put Switzerland in a re - cession ( QFinance , 2012 ) . The Canton of Geneva ranks ﬁ rst in Switzerland with respect to the level of unemployment , which in - creased from 6 . 0 % in 2007 / 8 to 6 . 8 % in 2009 and to 7 . 0 % in 2010 ( OCSTAT , 2012 ) . Overall , the prevalence of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons remained stable between 2007 and 2010 , despite the economic turndown . However , although not statistically signi ﬁ - cant , our data suggested that its prevalence disproportionately in - creased during these four years among participants with household monthly income b 3 , 000CHF . The recent economic crisis might have Table 1 Participants ' characteristics , number or mean ( % or standard deviation ) , by period and survey year in the 2007 – 2010 Geneva ( Switzerland ) Bus Santé study .

Guessous et al . / Preventive Medicine 55 ( 2012 ) 521 – 527 been harmful for those with the fewest economic resources . Forgoing healthcare is associated with out - of pocket expenditures on health , which include cost - sharing , self - medication and other expenditures paid directly by private households , whether the contact with the healthcare system was established by referral or by the patient ' s own initiative . Among the OECD countries , Switzerland has the highest out - of pocket expenditures ( OECD , 2011a ) . Beyond out - of - pocket participation , access to care depends on a multitude of fac - tors related to health systems ( e . g . , differences in healthcare cover - age , waiting times , referral patterns , ﬁ nancial support for eligible low - income individuals ) , and these factors differ between countries .

Guessous et al . / Preventive Medicine 55 ( 2012 ) 521 – 527 of sound hypotheses about forgoing healthcare for economic reasons in general . Because it has been suggested that subjects who report forgoing healthcare are paradoxically consuming more health services than subjects who do not ( Allin and Masseria , 2009 ) , we used information on care utilization during the same study period to include both objective and subjective indicators of forgoing healthcare . After fur - ther adjustment for SRHS , forgoing healthcare for economic reasons was associated with lower ambulatory care utilization among partic - ipants aged ≥ 50 years . Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some of this association is due to reporting bias ( i . e . subjects who reported forgoing care may have reported less care utilization ) , Table 3 Subgroup of participants aged ≥ 50 years .

Guessous et al . / Preventive Medicine 55 ( 2012 ) 521 – 527 our results showed a concordance betweenreported forgoing healthcare anduseofambulatorycare . Ofnote , thecross - sectionalnatureofoursur - veys precludes us to determining whether in the long - term , forgoing care for economic reasons is associated with consumption of less or more ambulatory care . Forgoing healthcare provider consultation and medication were not uncommon . Cost - related medication non - adherence is associated with increased risk of CVD and hospitalization ( Heisler et al . , 2004a ) . Studies have explored factors related to cost - related medication non - adherence , notably in older adults , psychiatric patients , and chron - ically ill adults ( Briesacher et al . , 2007 ; Zivin et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , ﬁ ndings suggest that a trusting physician - patient relationship may moderate the impact of cost pressures on patients ' medication adher - ence ( Piette et al . , 2005 ) . Identifying chronically ill adults who may have problems paying for prescription medications is essential , but few of these patients report that their clinicians asked them about pos - sible medication payment dif ﬁ culties ( Heisler et al . , 2004b ) . Regardless of physician practices , macro determinants ( e . g . , the system of health insurance and its coverage ) may have the most important structural ef - fects on forgoing healthcare . Our analyses were limited by the self - reported nature of the infor - mation collected . We did not consider psychosocial determinants of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons . Dif ﬁ cult events in child - hood and ﬁ nancial dif ﬁ culties in adulthood have been associated with forgoing care for ﬁ nancial reasons ( Bazin et al . , 2006 ) . We also did not consider communication and cultural factors that can in ﬂ u - ence the seeking of care or physician - patient communication . We a priori thought that having children aged b 15 years would be a better predictor of forgoing healthcare for the parents because , in general , children aged b 15 years do not have regular income . This was con - ﬁ rmed in multivariate analyses , which showed no independent asso - ciation between children aged ≥ 15 years and forgoing healthcare ( data not shown ) . The survey included all types of care ( routine , emer - gency , preventivecare ) withoutdistinction . Theabsenceoffollow - upsur - veys precluded us from disentangling the amount of care forgone and delayed . SRHS was only available among participants aged ≥ 50 years . Adjustment for SRHS only slightly changed the magnitude of the multi - variate associations . Thus , the importance of collecting this information when assessing forgoing healthcare was not con ﬁ rmed in our study ( Allin and Masseria , 2009 ) . Because we aimed to determine the indepen - dent associations of dependent children and marital status with forgoing healthcare for economic reasons , we did not divide income by consump - tion units , such as the number of relatives in the household . Because den - tal care is not covered by the basic health insurance in Switzerland , we conducted a subanalysis among subjects who forgo healthcare but not dentalcare . The associationbetweenhouseholdmonthlyincomeandfor - goinghealthcareremainedafterremovingdentalcare fromthede ﬁ nition ( data not shown ) . Conclusions Ourresults showedthatequityin the use of care is not guaranteed in the Swiss healthcare system . Further monitoring should be performed to con ﬁ rm these trends , as the current economic downturn may force part of the population to prioritize basic necessities other than health . Meanwhile , efforts should be made to prevent high - risk populations from forgoing care .
