DIFFUSION IN SOLIDS 1 ) The diffusivity of silver in solid silver metal is 1 . 0x10 - 17 m 2 / s at 500 o C and 7 . 0x10 - 13 m 2 / s at 1000 o C . Calculate the diffusivity ( diffusion coefficient ) of Silver in silver at 800 o C . 2 ) A sheet of steel 2 . 5 mm thick has nitrogen atmospheres on both sides at 900 o C and is permitted to achieve a steady - state diffusion condition . The diffusion coefficient for nitrogen in steel at this temperature is 1 . 2x10 - 10 m 2 / s , and diffusion flux is found to be 1 . 0x10 - 7 kg / m 2 s . Also it is known that the concentration of nitrogen in steel at the high pressure surface is 2 kg / m3 . How far into the sheet from this from this high - pressure side will the concentration be 0 . 5 kg / m 3 ? Assume a linear concentration profile .
