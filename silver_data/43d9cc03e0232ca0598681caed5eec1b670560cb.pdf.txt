A formulation of these processes is presented and analyzed to study steady - state network morphology . In bulk , we identify several scaling regimes in severing and branching protein concentrations and ﬁnd that the coupling between severing and branching is optimally exploited for conditions in vivo . Near the leading edge , we ﬁnd qualitative agreement with the in vivo morphology . When a cell crawls , it must reorganize the cytoplas - mic network of biopolymers that controls its shape . The shape and motility of the leading edge ( the lamel - lipodium ) of a crawling cell are determined primarily by a dynamic network of actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) [ 1 ] . These ﬁlaments are living polymers made up of monomeric G - actin , and have a deﬁnite polarity such that monomers tend to be added to the plus ( or “barbed” ) end , and tend to fall oﬀ at the minus ( or “pointed” ) end . A host of regulatory proteins concentrate plus ends at the lead - ing edge by controlling the morphology of the actin ﬁl - ament network [ 2 ] : capping proteins bind to the plus end of ﬁlaments , preventing further growth ; severing pro - teins , such as coﬁlin , bind to ﬁlaments and break them in two , enhancing depolymerization ; and the protein com - plex Arp2 / 3 nucleates branches from existing ﬁlaments , creating new plus ends at each branch tip and protect - ing the bound minus ends of branches from depolymer - ization . These proteins and their associated processes constitute the dendritic nucleation model [ 2 ] . This bi - ological model is supported by experiments that show that severing , capping and branching are all crucial to cell motility [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . In order to gain insight into how the cell controls its structural dynamics it is imperative to understand quantitatively how actin morphology can be controlled by the concentrations of these regulatory proteins . To date , theoretical studies of these kinetic processes have either omitted one or more of these critical processes [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] or have been restricted to describing just the overall amount of polymerization as a function of time [ 13 ] . Other treatments of actin - based motility have focused on the interplay of force generation with motility [ 14 , 15 ] , and treat the branched actin network either as an elastic continuum or as a collection of un - coupled ﬁlaments . In this paper , we adopt a complemen - tary approach that not only captures all of the critical features of the dendritic nucleation model but also allows the ﬁrst theoretical investigation of the morphology of the branched network . We conﬁrm biological and biochemi - cal understanding of the proteins involved by obtaining quantitative agreement with bulk in vitro experiments . We extend the approach to explore the interplay between actin morphology and motility near the leading edge of a crawling cell . The agreement of our theory with electron microscopy images of the leading edge of a crawling cell provides strong evidence that the dendritic nucleation model captures the key players in this important form of cell motility . We introduce a mean - ﬁeld rate equation formulation for actin structures that undergo polymerization , de - polymerization , capping , branching , and severing . We capture key morphological information by retaining the entire length distributions of ﬁlaments with free minus ends and of branches . Our formulation is constructed for polar actin assembly with branching ( Arp2 / 3 ) , severing ( coﬁlin ) and capping agents , whose action is described by rate constants . Initially , capping is taken into account by assigning a probability for a ﬁlament to be capped ; for reversible capping , this renormalizes the polymerization rate . Thus , k + is the eﬀective polymerization rate con - stant . The growth rate at the barbed end of a ﬁlament is k + ρ m , where ρ m is the free monomer concentration . The depolymerization rate is denoted by k − . Nucleation and dissociation of ﬁlament seeds are described by rate con - stants k n and k d [ 16 ] respectively . Nucleation of branches is modeled by the rate constant k arp = k 0 arp ρ Arp2 / 3 ρ 2 m [ 12 , 16 ] , where ρ Arp2 / 3 is the concentration of Arp2 / 3 . Eventually , Arp2 / 3 dissociates and branches detach at a rate k dr [ 17 ] . Severing occurs at a rate k s = k 0 s ρ s , where ρ s is the severing protein concentration [ 18 ] . The nucleotide state of the polymerized actin controls the rates of both branching ( preferred at ATP - actin sites [ 19 ] ) and severing ( preferred at ADP - actin sites [ 20 ] ) . We therefore consider hydrolysis and phosphate release oc - curring in sequence to convert newly polymerized ATP - actin to ADP - actin at a rate k pr [ 21 ] . The probability that a monomer at distance L from the barbed end of a ﬁlament is an ADP - actin monomer is then given by p ( L ) = 1 − exp ( − L / l c ) [ 9 ] , where l c = k + ρ m / k pr . We allow branching only on ATP - actin monomers and sev - ering only on ADP - actin monomers in ﬁlaments . Unless speciﬁed , k + = 8 . 7 µ M − 1 s − 1 [ 22 ] , k − = 0 . 03 s − 1 ( estimates are of the order of 10 − 2 − 10 − 1 2 [ 23 ] depending on conditions ) , k d = 5 × 10 − 4 s − 1 [ 16 ] , k n = 3 × 10 − 6 µ M − 1 s − 1 ( ﬁtted ; see caption of Fig . 1 ) , k 0 arp = 4 . 7 × 10 − 4 µ M − 3 s − 1 ( ﬁtted and consistent with [ 12 ] ) k dr = 0 . 0018 s − 1 [ 11 , 12 ] , k 0 s = 4 × 10 − 5 µ M − 1 s − 1 ( estimated from [ 18 , 24 ] ) and k pr = 0 . 002 s − 1 [ 25 ] . To capture the morphology we consider ( 1 ) the density of actin ﬁlaments of length L ( in monomer units ) with free minus ends ( i . e . minus ends that can depolymerize ) , ρ u ( L ) , ( 2 ) the density of branches of length L ( which have bound minus ends that cannot depolymerize ) , ρ b ( L ) , and ( 3 ) the density of monomers , ρ m . In the mean - ﬁeld bulk case where all rate constants and densities have no spatial dependence , we have : ˙ ρ u ( L ) = − k + ρ m ( ρ u ( L ) − ρ u ( L − 1 ) ) + k − ( ρ u ( L + 1 ) − ρ u ( L ) ) + k dr ρ b ( L ) − k s L − 1 X L ′ = 1 p ( L ′ ) ρ u ( L ) + ∞ X L ′ = L + 2 k s p ( L ) ρ b ( L ′ ) + ∞ X L ′ = L + 1 k s ( p ( L ) + p ( L ′ − L ) ) ρ u ( L ′ ) ( 1 ) ˙ ρ b ( L ) = − k + ρ m ( ρ b ( L ) − ρ b ( L − 1 ) ) − k dr ρ b ( L ) − k s L − 2 X L ′ = 1 p ( L ′ ) ρ b ( L ) + ∞ X L ′ = L + 1 k s p ( L ′ − L ) ρ b ( L ′ ) ( 2 ) ˙ ρ u ( 2 ) = − k + ρ m ρ u ( 2 ) + k − ρ u ( 3 ) − k d ρ u ( 2 ) + k dr ρ b ( 2 ) + k n ρ 2 m + ∞ X L ′ = 4 k s p ( 2 ) ρ b ( L ′ ) + ∞ X L ′ = 3 k s ˜ p ( L ′ ) ρ u ( L ′ ) ( 3 ) ˙ ρ b ( 2 ) = − k + ρ m ρ b ( 2 ) − k dr ρ b ( 2 ) + k arp ∞ X L = 2 ( L X L ′ = 1 1 − p ( L ′ ) ) ( ρ u ( L ) + ρ b ( L ) ) + ∞ X L ′ = 3 k s p ( L ′ − 2 ) ρ b ( L ′ ) , ( 4 ) with ˜ p ( L ′ ) = p ( 2 ) + p ( L ′ − 2 ) . A ﬁfth equation is the con - servation of total number of monomers . These equations are similar to those in Refs . [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] , though we distinguish between unbranched and branched ﬁlaments , which is necessary to quantitatively describe morphology . We ﬁrst study the steady state in absence of severing and nucleotide dependence . The length distributions are ρ u ( L ) = Ae − L / λ u + Be − L / λ b ( 5 ) ρ b ( L ) = Ce − L / λ b ( 6 ) where λ u = 1 / log k − k + ρ m ≈ k + ρ m k − − k + ρ m , λ b = 1 / log k dr + k + ρ m k + ρ m ≈ k + ρ m k dr . A , B and C are length - independent and depend on the rate constants and total actin concentration . The approximations are valid for L > > 1 , which is generally the case in vivo , and imply that k − ≈ k + ρ m and λ b = k + ρ m / k dr ≈ k − / k dr . We performed Brownian dynamics simulations to de - termine the accuracy of Eqns . ( 5 , 6 ) [ 26 ] . We have used rates somewhat diﬀerent from physiological ones to achieve equilibration within reasonable time . Fig 1 ( a ) shows that the simulations and theory yield length dis - tributions in good agreement with each other with no adjustable parameters at these concentrations . The predicted maximum in ρ u ( L ) , which occurs because branches can fall oﬀ , is also observed in the simulations . We have also compared our calculations to in vitro ex - periments by Blanchoin , et al . [ 27 ] . We neglect sev - ering , depolymerization and nucleotide - state dependence because those experiments did not contain severing pro - teins and ﬁlaments were stabilized by phalloidin . Our results for the barbed end concentration are plotted as a solid curve as a function of Arp2 / 3 concentration in Fig . 1 ( b ) , in good agreement with the experiment . When severing and monomer nucleotide state are in - cluded , analytical progress can be made by using “global” conservation principles at steady state to derive simple , approximate expressions for morphological properties . In steady state , the average total number of branches must be conserved . Equating the rate of production and destruction of branches gives k dr P ∞ L = 2 ρ b ( L ) = k 0 arp ρ Arp 2 / 3 ρ 2 m P ∞ L = 2 ( P LL ′ = 1 ( 1 − p ( L ′ ) ) ) ( ρ u ( L ) + ρ b ( L ) ) ≈ k 0 arp ρ Arp 2 / 3 f ( k − k + ) 2 ρ totm , where ρ totm is the total actin con - centration and f denotes the fraction of polymerized F - actin monomers that are ATP - bound and hence capable of supporting branching and immune to severing . Similarly , the average number of free ﬁlaments is ﬁxed such that k s ( 1 − f ) P ∞ L = 2 L ( ρ u ( L ) + ρ b ( L ) ) + k dr P ∞ L = 2 ρ b ( L ) = k d ρ u ( 2 ) . If we assume that ρ ( L ) can be described by one characteristic length , ¯ L u , implying ρ u ( 2 ) ≈ ρ totm / ¯ L u 2 , then ¯ L u = (cid:0) k d k s ( 1 − f ) + k 0 arp ρ Arp 2 / 3 f ( k − k + ) 2 (cid:1) 12 . In steady state , conserva - tion of ATP F - actin implies f ≈ (cid:0) k pr ¯ L u k − + 1 (cid:1) − 1 such that ¯ L u ≃ (cid:0) k d ( k pr ¯ L u + k − ) k s k pr ¯ L u + k ′ arp ( k − k + ) 2 k − (cid:1) 12 , ( 7 ) where k ′ arp = k 0 arp ρ Arp 2 / 3 . Comparing the two terms in the denominator , we see that branching does not sig - 3 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 L 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 1 10 1 ρ u ( L ) , ρ b ( L ) ( mM ) ρ b ( L ) ρ u ( L ) ( a ) 1 10 100 1000 L u 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 f k pr = 0 . 2 k pr = 0 . 002 k pr = 0 . 00002 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 ρ Arp2 / 3 ( nM ) 0 2 4 6 8 b ( n M ) Exp .

( b ) The barbed end concentration as a function of ρ Arp2 / 3 , as predicted by mean ﬁeld theory ( lines ) and measured by experiment ( points ) [ 27 ] . Here , k n and k 0 arp were estimated by ﬁtting to average ﬁlament length and branching percentage data from [ 27 ] ( not shown ) . Inset : The predicted steady - state value of the fraction of ATP - bound actin monomers in ﬁlaments , as a function of ¯ L u for various k pr in units of s − 1 . niﬁcantly aﬀect the average length ¯ L u until the Arp2 / 3 concentration , ρ Arp2 / 3 , is at least four orders of magni - tude larger than the coﬁlin concentration , ρ s . In vitro motility experiments [ 3 ] typically operate in the regime where ρ Arp2 / 3 < ρ s . Then Eq . 7 shows that for large k s , ¯ L u is short and scales as ¯ L u ∼ ( k d k − / ( k s k pr ) ) 13 . For lower k s , ( but k s > > k ′ arp ( k − k + ) 2 ) , ¯ L u is larger and shows a more sensitive dependence on k s : ¯ L u ∼ ( k d / k s ) 12 . The crossover between these two regimes occurs when ¯ L u ∼ 10 . On the other hand , when severing is negligible and k pr is small such that side - branching dominates , then ¯ L u ∝ 1 / p k ′ arp . For small k s and large phosphate release rates k pr , where end - branching dominates , ¯ L u ∝ 1 / k ′ arp . These scaling predictions are experimentally testable . The density of branched ﬁlaments is also constant in steady state . As k pr increases , branching occurs only near the barbed end of ﬁlaments . Thus , the branch den - sity will depend not on the number density of monomers in ﬁlaments , but on the number density of ﬁlaments , which is sensitive to severing and is given by P ρ b ∝ √ k s k ′ arp . On the other hand , if there is no dependence on nucleotide state , the branch density depends on the total F - actin concentration , which depends on k ′ arp , but not sensitively on k s . These results suggest that the dependence of branch density on the nucleotide state of ﬁlament monomers al - lows the cell to control morphology by varying the con - centration of severing protein [ 13 ] . For in vivo values of k pr , the system switches from a side - branching regime ( f = 1 ) to an end - branching regime ( f = 0 ) as the av - erage lengths increase from tens to several hundred sub - units , the range typically observed in vivo . In Fig . 1 ( b ) , we plot the predicted value of f as a function of average ﬁlament length for diﬀerent values of the phosphate re - lease rate . For the in vivo value of the phosphate release rate and the in vivo range of ﬁlament lengths ( ranging from tens to several hundreds of monomers ) , the range of f that is covered is almost maximal . This suggests that in vivo , the branching morphology ( controlled by f ) is maximally sensitive to severing proteins . Branching and severing have been viewed as antagonistic , because branching promotes ﬁlament growth and severing pro - motes depolymerization . However , our results show that all processes combine to give maximal cooperativity be - tween branching and severing . We now consider the coupling of morphology to motil - ity by conﬁning the system between two hard walls both moving with velocity v . The “front” wall models the leading edge of the cell and while the “back” wall de - notes the the back edge of the lamellipodium . Because capping is necessary to motility [ 7 ] , we extend Eqns . ( 1 - 4 ) to explicitly include a capping rate k c and uncapping rate k uc by deﬁning four populations of ﬁlaments : capped and uncapped branched and unbranched ﬁlaments . Now ρ u ( L , t , z ) denotes the density of capped or uncapped ﬁl - aments of length L whose barbed ends are at distance z from the front wall . Experiments ﬁnd that ﬁlaments are typically at an angle of θ = 35 ◦ with respect to the leading edge [ 28 ] , so we assume that all ﬁlaments are at that angle with the wall . Because Arp2 / 3 is activated at the leading edge and diﬀuses away from it , we model the Arp2 / 3 concentration proﬁle as an exponential decay from the front with a decay length z arp [ 29 ] . Similarly , we use a severing concentration proﬁle that is an inverted exponential with a rise length of z s to model the eﬀect of nucleotide dependence on the severing eﬃciency . Fi - nally , the amount of free monomers is determined by the conservation of actin , and actin that ﬂows beyond the back wall is recycled in as free monomers ; our results are for systems suﬃciently large such that actin reaching the back wall is small compared to actin within the sys - tem . We use an exponential proﬁle with a decay length of D / v t , consistent with the diﬀusion equation , where D is the diﬀusion constant of free monomers and v t is the 4 0 10 20 30 L ρ s = 1 µ M ρ s = 10 µ M ρ s = 20 µ M ρ s = 40 µ M ( a ) 0 1 2 3 z ( µ m ) 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 5 1 . 7 1 . 9 B r a n c h d i s t a n c e 1 10 100 ρ s ( µ M ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Leng t h ( µ m ) ( b ) FIG . 2 : ( a ) ¯ L vs . distance from leading edge , z , for diﬀer - ent coﬁlin concentrations , ρ s .

We choose v t = 250 v , where v is the speed of the moving surface , consistent with results of Zicha et al . [ 30 ] . Not all values of v t yield reasonable morpholo - gies . If , for example , v t = 500 v , the system tends toward a state with no ﬁlaments . In steady - state , we ﬁnd that branching , severing , and capping are all needed to obtain a morphology that is consistent with experiments . Branching in the front is needed to help the system “keep up” with the wall by nu - cleating new ﬁlaments . Capping towards the front chan - nels new ﬁlament growth into shorter branches and thus increases ﬁlament density . Finally , severing is needed to replenish the free monomer supply . Fig . 2 shows the steady state morphology for the system with a moving surface . In Fig . 2 ( a ) , we plot the average length of ﬁla - ments ( branched and unbranched ) as a function of dis - tance z from the front wall . The average length , ¯ L , is short near the surface , and increases to approximately 100 nm at a distance of roughly 0 . 5 µ m from the surface . As the severing protein concentration ρ s increases , ¯ L de - creases with increasing z , eventually reaching zero when all ﬁlaments are depolymerized away . The distance at which ¯ L reaches zero provides an upper bound on the lamellipodium length , i . e . the distance the lamel - lipodium extends into the cell from the leading edge . This length is plotted in the inset to Fig . 2 ( b ) as a func - tion of ρ s . For tens of micromolar concentrations , the lamellipodium length is tens of microns , consistent with experimental observations [ 31 ] . The predicted length in - creases with actin concentration . Fig . 2 ( b ) shows that the average distance between branches monotonically increases with z . The higher ρ s , the greater the increase in the branch distance with z . In short , Fig . 2 implies that the morphology consists of short branched ﬁlaments within the ﬁrst micron of the leading edge , with longer , less branchy ﬁlaments further away . These observations are consistent with electron microscopy images of the lamellipodium in crawling ker - atocytes [ 31 ] , suggesting that the dendritic nucleation model captures the minimal set of proteins involved . A thorough , quantitative experimental test of our results near a moving surface should provide a stringent check on the validity of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly near the leading edge of a crawling cell .
