20 On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI JAY CUNNINGHAM , GABRIELLE BENABDALLAH , and DANIELA ROSNER , HCDE , University of Washington ALEX TAYLOR , HCID , City , University of London Why is the solution the end point to a problem ? While many in HCI and design have examined the impulse to solve problems – the solutionist or techno - solutionist mindset – we examine the logic that binds the solution and the problem together as a pair . Focusing on the timely and consequential problem of systemic racial injustice , we think through the paradoxical possibility that the pairing of the problem and solution ( so often treated as the default in design and HCI ) perpetuates the very conditions we seek to improve . With Calvin Warren’s profound Afro - pessimism , we recognize how the tools used to solve structural inequities around Black life are constructed with inequities themselves . The problem - solution , therefore , is a dead end . We use this paradox as an invitation to rethink ongoing efforts to seek equity and justice more broadly , setting out a fragile but hopeful path for HCI and design .

At the event , Warren recalls listening to one speaker after another assert the value of Black life and the potential for restorative racial justice ( amidst a backdrop of applause ) . When it came time for him to speak , he describes already knowing what he had to say : “I told the audience there was no solution to the problem of anti - blackness ; it will continue without end , as long as the world exists . Furthermore , all the solutions pre - sented rely on antiblack instruments to address anti - blackness , a vicious and tortuous Authors’ addresses : J . Cunningham , G . Benabdallah , and D .

I also said that humanist affect ( the good feeling we get from hopeful solutions ) will not translate into freedom , justice , recognition , or resolution . It merely provides temporary reprieve from the fact that blacks are not safe in an antiblack world , a fact that can become overwhelm - ing . The form of anti - blackness might alter , but antiblackness itself will remain a con - stant —despite the power of our imagination and political yearnings . ” ( emphasis added ) [ 91 , p . 3 ] This unruly declaration exposes a treatment of the solution that is both familiar and new to HCI . To date , HCI scholars have explored the dangers of developing technology in response to any ( and potentially every ) problem [ 17 , 77 , 82 ] . A key strand of this work focuses on the absurdity of solv - ing structural issues like anti - Black racism with individual devices [ 50 , 80 ] . Scholars like Safiya Noble [ 63 ] and Ruha Benjamin [ 12 , 13 ] characterize a technology design space perpetuating such harms by proposing over - reaching , under - performing , and paradoxically problem - making solu - tions . With terms like solutionism [ 6 ] , techno - fix ( ation ) [ 51 ] , and technochauvinism [ 24 ] , they emphasize the importance of paying attention to the wider racializing effects of technology solu - tions , even in our own community [ 65 ] . Ogbonnaya - Ogburu and colleagues [ 65 ] identify the “in - terest convergence , ” where HCI racial inclusion efforts risk perpetuating forms of racism through the veneer of altruism and “innovation . ” According to O’Leary , et al . [ 87 ] , “conventional design practices” themselves “may perpetuate forms of institutional racism , ” enabling and legitimizing racialized forms of inequity . Looking to the racializing effects of technology development more broadly , critical race and technology scholars have explored a range of issues , including : digital devices that fail to meet the needs of Black and Brown users [ 41 ] ; Blackness as a key site through which surveillance is practiced , narrated , and resisted [ 25 ] ; and computing firms’ development of technology that disproportionately disadvantages Black Americans [ 57 ] . Complementing this range of work , scholars have brought an intersectional lens to questions of equity [ 32 , 71 , 72 ] , cit - ing design as a resource for alternative forms of world - building [ 21 , 73 ] . Yet despite this rich body of critical analysis , the HCI field continues to struggle with inclusive approaches that effectively address the pervasive and lasting inequitable consequences of racism . Much uncertainty remains around the problem - solution binary [ 80 ] and the forms of techno - solutionism rooted in systematic and institutional racism [ 23 ] . As Miguel Sicart and Irini Shklovski observe , it remains a challenge to “unsee the world” as a place replete with problems for technology to solve [ 80 , p . 1 , 860 ] . What it might mean to “unsee” solutions as end points to problems is where this article begins . In Ontological Terror , Warren’s proposition is nihilistic but ultimately fosters hope . He shows how the problem - solving approach does not work . It fails to account for the way words like “being” are denied to certain people , an inquiry was taken up by several HCI and critical race scholars [ 23 , 53 , 63 ] . Beginning to unsee problems then means grappling with denial’s violent legacies . And it means understanding this denial as an inherent assumption of all Western thought , includ - ing thinking within HCI . Warren argues that to address this situation we must transcend ( white Western ) ontology . Within HCI and design literatures , ontology refers to a range of phenomena , from the formal representation of categories [ 55 ] to an understanding of what it means to exist [ 33 , 94 ] . In line with this latter strand of work , Warren’s ontology engages with questions about the nature of being as it is rooted in Western philosophy . Yet contrasting with much theorizing in design , he troubles this ontology , writing of an ontological terror – the particular horror induced by the “metaphysical noth - ing” of being Black in an anti - Black world . As we describe in the sections that follow , this reading of ontology shows how HCI’s approach to the problem and solution pair has particular consequences for technological relationships to life and liberation [ 2 , 25 ] . Drawing on work by Warren , André ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI 20 : 3 Brock , Edna Bonhomme , Simone Browne and connected lines of inquiry [ 2 , 13 , 25 , 63 ] , this article proposes the expansion of a critical body of design scholarship on solutions and their pitfalls ( e . g . , [ 43 , 52 ] ) . As Warren writes of the double bind , the HCI field is faced with a conundrum where to solve the problem of anti - Black racism , it is left to think with the logics and structures that erase , harm , and enact violence toward Black lives . The problem - solution then becomes a dead end . For HCI and design , we see this as an invitation to rethink ongoing efforts to seek equity and justice more broadly . We ask “could it be that the problem - solution pair is part of and indeed constitu - tive of an ontological framing that can only ever reproduce the inequities , harms , and violences that design and HCI are working against ? ” [ 47 ] Thinking with Warren and other scholarship in Black studies , we argue that a possible response to the dead end of the problem - solution sets out a fragile but hopeful path for HCI and design . We imagine a design that might resist the problem - solution pairing and contemplate the dizzying possibility of the solution without a problem . This is a possibility that has no end and that might just create the conditions for existence otherwise . When Warren first announces the impossibility of a solution , his comments resonate with those in HCI that highlight the futility of solutions or their optimization [ 91 ] . He describes the ceaseless nature of the problem by questioning the potential for an endpoint . But Warren’s next statement harnesses a long line of critical thought ( see the work of Hortense Spillers [ 81 ] , among others ) to unravel the concept of the solution itself . He calls attention to the infrastructures ( such as con - stitutional amendments , policies , and procedures ) on which a solution might depend as the very mechanisms by which the problem can be reproduced—thus the “vicious and tortuous cycle . ” HCI and technology scholars have similarly noted that designers can not hope to solve a problem with approaches that originate from the same systems that created the problem [ 12 , 50 , 80 ] . For exam - ple , AI - assisted hiring procedures and emerging AI credit scoring algorithms designed to reduce racial bias might reproduce racial inequities by relying on “efficient” metrics for predictive decision - making such as zip code and age . The AI solution grants HCI researchers the ability to gloss over the conditions in which the solution already operates under and plays into pre - existing racializing frameworks , where personhood ( and associated value ) is conferred to some and not others . The solution can ignore the way hiring procedures and wider power structures do not affect everyone equally because not everyone is granted the same ontological status . The solution’s blind spots are therefore not only innately structural but ontological . Our thinking with Blackness grows out of a solidarity with those experiencing the amplifica - tion of racial unrest and its connections to wider societal developments . We currently live in a period of elevated racism and racial violence with growing political and legal legitimacy . We see communities develop solutions to addressing injustice through civic engagement , as displayed by non - profits like the Creative Reaction Lab ( crxlab ) , founded in 2014 by Antionette Carroll in Ferguson , Missouri [ 27 ] . Launched during the community uprising after the murder of Michael Brown Jr . , the Crxlab’s mission focuses on building a Black and Latinx youth - led , community - centered movement of a new type of civic leader : “Redesigners for Justice . ” This cultivating mindset directly underlines the premise that everybody is a designer and challenges the roles of those who are typically dominant in the design process . The Crxlab pioneered “Equity - Centered Community Design , ” as a “creative problem - solving framework based on equity , humility - building , integrating history and healing practices , addressing power dynamics , and co - creating with the community” [ 27 ] . Ultimately , the work is premised on the belief that systems of oppression , inequality , and in - equity are by design ; therefore , they can and must be redesigned . These and other initiatives expose how design practices might work as a mode of generative refusal and collective imagination . Just as they threaten to “solve” away the messiness of urban life ( e . g . , housing expansion amid racial dispossession ) , design practices might make way for something new , presenting opportunities to influence social , civic , and economic justice .

With this theoretical investigation , we emphasize the importance of Warren and other related works examining Blackness to traditional or all - inclusive HCI problem - solution thinking . For those who do not experience anti - Black racism , this argument might feel uninterpretable , unexpected , and possibly jarring . We also accept that this argument could feel like a peculiar or problematic importing of theory , a tactic for which scholars have appropriately criticized HCI [ 28 , 71 , 85 ] . Rather than import theory , we strive to inform HCI theory and practice based on vital historical and philosophical contributions that HCI scholarship too often overlooks . 2 WHAT IS SOLUTIONISM ? To begin our inquiry , we turn to HCI theorizing on solutions and , specifically , what character - izes a technological solution within HCI . To date , HCI scholars have mapped specific forms of problem - solving ( e . g . , [ 31 , 66 , 76 ] ; critiqued the problem - solution binary [ 11 , 15 ] ; and examined the movement of problems across contexts [ 87 ] . On the one hand , this work identifies the para - dox of solving structural problems such as wealth gaps with apps focused on individual behavior change [ 39 ] . On the other hand , scholars note the propensity for developing solutions to problems that do not exist [ 16 ] . Examples include the electric kettle that sends you a glowing green ( go for it ) or red ( not right now ) signal depending on nation - wide power activity [ 16 , 59 ] . Or the networked camera that tracks people’s cooking activity to tell them if they deviate from a recipe [ 16 , 59 ] . Whether one can imagine people wanting a “solution” to their cooking challenges is beside the point . The smart device or augmented camera frames the kitchen as a problem to solve . The fram - ing of cooking as a problem to solve subtly shifts the ontological status of the phenomenon from a sensory care practice to a specific protocol . When an unlikely problem surfaces , a techno - solution like tracking comes into view . When Meredith Broussard [ 24 ] coins the feminist concept of technochauvinism she is hoping to do more than announce technological hyperbole . She is rooting “the belief that tech is always the solution” [ 24 ] in masculinized STEM disciplines . For her and other critical technology schol - ars [ 7 , 50 ] , the propensity of technology design to apply computation widely to problems reflects patriarchal norms . And this approach is not new . During World War II , influential American math - ematician Norbert Weiner cast egalitarianism as forged in the application of computational design to societal challenges , Fred Turner explains [ 90 ] . Contemporary techno - solutionist trends emerge from and reproduce the techno - optimist roots of computing [ 3 ] . Responding to these critiques , a strand of HCI scholarship suggests that designers should pro - pose alternative possibilities [ 7 , 80 ] . Instead of answering problems with superficial solutions , they should analyze their potentials [ 11 ] . Urban planning scholars Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber take this approach in their landmark 1973 article Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning [ 74 ] , where they ground their critiques in the notion of “wicked problems . ” Characterizing urban planning as one of the most optimistic of disciplines , they point to the desire for a “perfect future history” that tends to prefer “tame” ( solvable ) over “wicked” ( unsolvable or lacking an optimal solution ) problems . Unlike the mathematical equation or even a chess game , wicked problems like poverty , education , or mobility produce social and political complications without fixed answers , formula - tions , conclusions , contingencies , or values . Importantly , the authors characterize such problems as “ [ n ] ot “solution . ” [ . . . ] At best they are only re - solved – over and over again” [ 74 , p . 160 ] . Writ - ing amidst the 1970s “science wars” wherein social scientists proffered a shift from generalizable , efficiency - based frameworks to value - based alternatives , this insight anticipated a range of initia - tives within the fields of design , engineering , and computer science ( from critical - technical prac - tice , value - sensitive design , and participatory design toward algorithmic fairness ) – each calling for wider forms of accountability . Rittel and Webber make just such a case in planning , concluding : ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI 20 : 5 “Planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate” [ 74 , p . 167 ] . They frame social ( or structural ) problems as socially and politically contingent . While largely generative , not least because of the attentions given to values and accountability , what Horst and Rittel deliver remains squarely in the realm of Western thought . They problematize the scope of problems and solutions , and give us a far richer register to examine them . But they ultimately overlook the larger mechanisms ( e . g . , the legal frameworks that sustain racial violence or the social structures that legitimize the erasures of Black lives ) that determine whose lives count within , or exert control over , decision making . They overlook whose personhood a solution depends on . Ultimately the solutions never reach the margins . A parallel body of work traces the solution to violent colonial legacies of science and technology ( see Alondra Nelson [ 62 ] , Edna Bonhomme [ 18 ] , Eden Medina [ 58 ] ) . For example , Bonhomme [ 20 ] ties famed German scientist Robert Koch – a Nobel Prize winner and the namesake of the German federal agency responsible for disease control and prevention – to anti - Black colonial expansion . At the start of the last century , Koch set up concentration camps for East Africans to research Bugula sleeping sickness in Germany’s African colonies . In the camps , he coerced patients to take a reagent containing arsenic – “even though it was known to cause pain , blindness and even death , ” Bonhomme explains . A crafting of a solution to infections like cholera for a largely white European citizenry ultimately contributed to the infection and harm of East Africans . In examples like this , the problem - solution pair , as a mode of technology development , marks more than a tendency to characterize phenomena in terms of the technology and science that can fix it . It also suggests a mode of development mired in anti - Black racism . By helping us see what a solution is , Bonhomme and others leave us with the question : what does a solution do ? 3 WHAT DOES A SOLUTION DO ? To pursue a solution is to make a decision about who counts and what effects we , HCI researchers , implicate ourselves in . It is to draw a line , somewhere , between whose stakes are “actionable” and whose are more a fact of life . It quickly becomes apparent that the rationalizing forces , the problem - solution relationship , enabling such work can be used to privilege some actors and exclude , deprive , and exploit others . In response to this thinking , we want to ask : how does devising a solution determine what or who matters ? 3 . 1 To Decide the Solution Is to Decide the Stakes Declaring a solution is not an inert or neutral gesture . It is to make a claim . It is to say that the unique attributes and characteristics of particular persons , and their racist idealizations , hold more substantial significance over others . It is also to use a rationale to justify an effect , even if the effect has negative implications for those consigned to the periphery or ontological oblivion . At a high - level , we have seen this version of the solution ( what some have called solutionism [ 43 , 80 ] operating in HCI’s problem framing . Turning our attention to a more concrete example , consider the very contemporary challenge around contact tracing . With the rise of the novel coronavirus , many governments and health agencies turned toward a technological solution to track and trace its incidence and contagion . In simple terms , the apps and services being trialed and deployed used a combination of the relative distance between bodies and the duration of that distance to calculate whether someone who has contracted the virus has made “contact” with others , and whether isolation or restrictions on movements need to be imposed . Governments and tech firms alike cast the question of contact as the problem to be solved , and what requires an accompanying logic . The technical difficulties of implementing these systems are becoming self - evident [ 83 , 84 ] , sur - facing a litany of poor decisions and errors that some in HCI , with their expertise in location track - ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . 20 : 6 J . Cunningham et al . ing , could well have predicted [ 8 , 26 , 30 , 88 ] and in some cases did mitigate [ 1 ] . However , despite the variations between specific technical implementations and their shortcomings , the prevailing logic to the solution of contact tracing remains consistent . This solution reveals a view of bodies as neutral , captured , and enumerated in standardized metrics of distance and counts of contact . We can , however , think about the stakes very differently . As many will have seen , the spread of the coronavirus and the associated morbidities presented in national and worldwide statistics reveal the virus has not impacted people evenly . As activists and artists have so compellingly laid bare [ 10 , 18 ] , Black and Brown people , particularly those in vulnerable socioeconomic circum - stances , living in rural communities , and with limited access to healthcare , education , mobility , and housing , are being most severely impacted , suffering disproportionate death rates . Race and socioeconomics are woven through coronavirus deaths [ 40 , 56 ] . Rather than achieving an imagined neutrality , contact tracing apps are extending modes of surveillance rooted in intersecting forms of discrimination . Connected with surveillance , contract tracing requires the collection of user data , which raises concerns about privacy and intent of use . It is therefore dangerous to ignore the his - tory of racist medical experiments and unequal health care experiences inflicted on Black commu - nities , which has resulted in the significant and longstanding distrust of public health authorities [ 54 ] . To this extent , one study suggested that Black Americans might be more likely to oppose a digital contact tracing app [ 96 ] . Negative experiences are common to many racialized groups , and some social determinants of health have historically limited equitable opportunities for economic prosperity , physical well - being , and emotional health , as recognized by the U . S . CDC [ 35 ] . Accounting for such a backdrop would mean considerable changes to what those developing the tools deem to matter . It would mean a government actor or tech firm mapping how , in the ongoing pandemic , those who are structurally placed at a disadvantage in society – usually living with less and invariably having to do much more to achieve any kind of equality – are the most severely impacted . It would be for the overseeing actors and agencies to recognize that bodies and movements are not the same and do not have the same freedoms of movement or to contact . And it would be to acknowledge how categories of labor often marked by race and low wages , such as care - work , cleaning , delivery , and so on . , necessitate manual handling , heavy breathing , and a closeness of bodies – all things that complicate contact measured in Cartesian coordinates . The solution to contact tracing seen in the current crop of apps is a decision about what mat - ters , who matters , and how they should matter—a decision about what is at stake . Jeffrey Kahn and the Johns Hopkins Project on Ethics and Governance of Digital Contact Tracing Technolo - gies ( DCTT ) [ 54 ] have considered these questions in the design and use of digital technology and tracing tracing ( DCTT ) , pointing to questions around location data , sharing with public health au - thorities , and the ethics of mandated or incentivized data collection . Amid such tracking , a person falls outside of the count because , for example , their labor , pay , or race locates someone beyond the neutral category and subjects them to yet further risk . The app works within a framework that rationalizes how bodies should be counted and what bodies are worth counting . As the next section explores , we HCI scholars often do not even realize that technology designers are making the decision . For those in positions of privilege , the work unfolds within common assumptions that obscure other ways of doing . Recognizing the problem - solution pair we use to determine what matters means paying attention to our decisions and how we position ourselves within them . 3 . 2 To Work on a Solution is to Take a Position To be in a position to define the problem through its solution , to decide what matters , and what is at stake , is a privilege . When we , in HCI , choose to work on a solution to a problem , we are making not just a claim about the problem but about where we should stand or how we should ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI 20 : 7 be positioned with respect to that problem . When we design new apps to locate shelters or food banks , utilize DIY fabrication tools to fill the gap in critical equipment such as ventilators and masks , or trace the contact between bodies , we are often intervening in more than one way . We may be aiding someone or something but we are also claiming a position of oversight and authority . These claims reveal the problems that design can be responsive to – the “real” design problems – and that we have the necessary skills to judge what counts as a solution . As with the stakes we decide upon , the trouble is that some of us are inured to our positions of privilege . With a problem - solving mindset , the goal becomes our focus ; we may fail to recognize how we are , ourselves , implicated in wider networks of racializing relations , ones that again cre - ate and sustain the injustices and harms we are seeking to alleviate . Many of us fail to account for our position in a wider politics and overarching mode of existence , whether congenitally or delib - erately . To put this in more concrete terms , let us return to contact tracing . Moving through this example , we come to a point where designers’ limited experiences and positioning ( and their corre - sponding stakes ) —a profession where Black designers make up just 3 % of the industry [ 92 ] —seem to lie at the heart of wider societal problems . With the repeated spikes in coronavirus infections , contact tracing apps became a highly visible and relatively contested site of data collection . As users , we have little idea of what is actually going on inside the technology—both in terms of how we are being monitored and how the systems are in - terpreting our movements and actions . We must trust organizations to make their intentions visible and the uneven patchwork of regulatory agencies to protect our rights as citizens and consumers . A point of contention , for example , has been whether users’ individual contact and tracing data should reside centrally and under the auspices of a state - run healthcare system or decentralized and distributed in ways that make it impossible to identify individuals [ 60 ] . Health services in the UK and France have invoked a public health and moral imperative to defend centralized data storage , and multinational technology firms such as Apple and Google have promised to protect people’s data using decentralized technological solutions . The solution is cast as both a techno - logical problem of determining contact and , at the same time , deciding what rationale trumps the means of data storage . These are of course problems we in HCI and tech broadly are well positioned to imagine solutions to ( the disagreements notwithstanding ) . However , the positions governments and corporations have taken in designing contact tracing solutions align with a historical thread that cannot be simply erased with terms and conditions or the promised goodwill . With the stakes we have all too briefly discussed above , we must accept that in deciding on the solutions , positions are circumscribed that turn a blind eye to the effects on already marginalized racial groups and persist with the idea of an objective or neutral gaze , a view from nowhere but of everything and everyone . Specifically , they put to work what scholars like Simone Browne [ 25 ] , Ruja Benjamin [ 12 ] , and Ramon Amaro point to as a “universal computational gaze” [ 2 ] . This universal computational gaze presumes , for example , that what remains equal are people’s capacities to move , both in relation to one another and independently , and thus to social distance or stay at home . In this way , bodies are surveilled as if there was a level playing field , and the computationally enabled reduction of bodies and contact to enumerated averages is viewed as ignorant to categories like race . It is here , in the “routinized surveillance” of bodies and their conditions , where there are loud echoes of a legacy of racialized discrimination and anti - Black violence . As Benjamin writes , the “default settings” to many of the technologies that surveil citizens “routinely build upon and deepen inequality . ” [ 12 , p . 2 ] To construct a position of neutrality in contact tracing means presupposing a gaze before or outside of race , somehow beyond the racial categories of Black and Brown . But at the same time it means ignoring that race , and specifically being Black or Brown , is without a ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . 20 : 8 J . Cunningham et al . doubt at stake in the spread of the coronavirus and especially its associated death rates [ 18 , 19 ] . It entails taking a position that sees the structures that put Black and Brown people at risk outside the solution . This , describes Benjamin , is the “duplicity of technological fixes – purported solutions that nevertheless sediment existing hierarchies” [ 12 , p . 3 ] . Seen through these traces and sediments , we in HCI research are left with a vivid sense that de - veloping a solution is always working from , and within the limits of , a particular position . We see that these issues , as Browne [ 25 ] so sensitively and adeptly shows , run through histories of racial - ized surveillance in which bodies are treated arbitrarily . The controversies surrounding data and privacy in contact tracing apps and the divergent positions on data storage taken by health agen - cies , on the one hand , and corporations like Apple and Google , on the other [ 60 ] , emerge precisely because we see what positions could afford , what logics and values they thread a line through . To take a position on a problem , from the endpoint of a solution , means situating oneself within a framework of meanings , values , and beings . In cases of contract tracing , and those well beyond , it entails formulating solutions from a position implicated in the lives and livelihoods of others , with special attention to those within the margins . Those of us who decide what technological capacities and possibilities to build are also deciding what histories of discrimination , exploitation , and violence we choose to see , and which we elide or erase . But , at the same time , to work on a solution to a problem means taking a position that is too often located outside of the frame of the problem - solution . Although we in HCI research might try to be accountable for the systems we are designing and building , the appeal of the solution persists . Our fixation on solutions reveals a failure to capture what we are implicated within . We know the solutions we develop are often not enough , and in some cases , we risk doing more harm than good . But we are not sure how else to approach design – or how else to position ourselves . Is this the crisis of solution development ? A faulty frame does not imply the impossibility of a solution , but it does open a path for interrogating positions . André Brock [ 23 ] makes a similar point in relation to his development of critical technocul - tural discourse analysis ( CTDA ) on Black Twitter . “If the next researcher employs a CTDA analysis on the same data , using the same theoretical framework , their findings will differ because of their positionality to the framework and the data” [ 23 , p . 1 , 027 ] . Reflecting on his position , Brock notes that he does not seek to solve structural inequalities and harms connected with digital plat - forms like Twitter ; instead , he uses his analysis to “decenter normative discourses” about those inequities and harms . When any of us struggle to see the value in the solutions we design , and question the contributions we are making to wider social issues , could it be less about the specific devices and services we have built ( and their immediate outcomes ) and more about the positions we hold ? Could it be that some of us are in fact struggling to come to terms with these positions and , crucially , the problem - solution relationship that comes with them ? As alluded to in the introduction , the authors of this article reflect this range of positionings and questions . While some of us experience racialization today , we each bring different and dis - tinct histories of racialization . One of us experiences what Black studies scholars describe as “post - traumatic slavery syndrome , ” the sustained multigenerational and unresolved trauma arising from the experience of chattel slavery persisting through American society’s policies of inequality , racism , and oppression [ 29 , 49 ] . For some of us , our families have borne the brunt of racial trans - lation , in one case fleeing Nazi concentration camps to absorb an identity of whiteness on stolen lands . In another case , because of adoption , being subsumed into the tangled web of colonial pasts and presents while at the same time marked by East Asian ancestry . In yet another , grappling with a double French colonial legacy that carries histories of cultural dislocations and of what Frantz Fanon called the “affective anomalies” of racism [ 34 ] . With these lived experiences , we grapple un - evenly with being and belonging to neatly defined racial categories . Our subject positions expose ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI 20 : 9 long histories of progress narratives – including the worlds of design and development – that have marginalized , exploited , and harmed people with darker skin . The thoughts here are part of the ongoing work of coming to terms with the conditions we are living through and believing it could be otherwise . 4 WHAT DOES BEING A PROBLEM DO ? We have so far considered the solution in relation to broad societal problems such as a global pandemic amid ongoing anti - Black racism . Coming back to Warren , we want to consider what those problems become when designers confront questions of ontology . 4 . 1 From Ontological Design to Ontological Problems At first blush , this idea might seem familiar . A long line of HCI and design scholars including Wino - grad and Flores , Anne - Marie Willis , Tony Fry , Cameron Tonkinwise , and most recently Arturo Escobar have argued for something akin to ontological design [ 33 , 36 , 86 , 94 ] . Ontological design tends to describe the way the designed world also designs the designer [ 4 , 93 ] . In their widely influential 1972 book Understanding Computers and Cognition , Winograd and Flores write , “The most important designing is ontological . It constitutes an intervention in the background of our heritage , growing out of our already - existent ways of being in the world , and deeply affecting the kinds of beings that we are” [ 94 ] . Following their argument , it could be argued that through its capacity to shape the inner and outer conditions of existence , design is always ontological . On closer inspection , ontological design presumes a particular orientation . Any experience of the world presupposes a specific stance . Ontology has historically eluded this stance by supersed - ing experience in favor of an abstracted theory of being . This ties to arguments on how the origins of racial Western social theory are epistemologically bound to their positionality ( see Robinson on Marx’s “universalism” ) [ 75 ] . Some of us might understand our being as shaped by design . But , as Warren might ask , what happens to those of us whose being “functions in an antiblack world without being” ? [ p . 6 ] What happens to those of us whose being is not the target of the solution but the site of the problem ? Drawing on W . E . B . Du Bois and Fred Moten , Warren names the “problem of being black” as the central problem of our world , both now and for decades to come . By problem , he refers to the ongoing influence of chattel slavery . For Warren , this thinking sits at the nexus of Afro - pessimist and Afro - optimist scholarship , two contrasting views of Black being . To put the contrast too sim - ply : where Afro - optimist scholarship would call for the reclaiming of humanity ( we are all human ) , Afro - pessimist scholarship would point to the impossibility of that claim ( the category of human as unrecoverably anti - Black—carrying with it and reproducing legacies of racialized colonial oppres - sion [ Wynter ] ) . Drawing on Afro - pessimist theorizing , Warren equates being Black—or Blackness , in Warren’s terms—to ontological nothingness . The ontological claim describes a paradox : being Black depends on non - being . Drawing on W . E . B .

Publication date : April 2023 . 20 : 10 J . Cunningham et al . 4 . 2 The Problem as a Double Bind To explain this paradox , Warren turns his attention to the work of American poet and Black studies scholar Fred Moten , who in his work tries to answer the question of “Blackness without ontology” . Ontology , writes Warren ( after Moten ) , is an “exceptionally hostile place for blackness and renders blacks homeless within such a structure” [ 91 ] Moten , therefore , seeks to develop a “para - ontology , ” one that would free Blackness from ontological expectation . But as Warren points out , how extri - cable is paraontology from the Western ontological project ? He writes : “The difficulty of such an enterprise is that we do not have a grammar outside of ontology to describe the “paraontological , ” which means that [ Moten’s ] idea of paraontology is still tethered to that which it is designed to escape” [ 91 ] . This paradox has been understood by Warren and other historians of Blackness as the concept of the double bind . The concept notably emerges from Du Bois’ reference to “double consciousness” – or what Saidiya Hartman [ 47 ] later calls a “bifurcated existence” – wherein someone experiences life as “both an object of property and [ as ] a person . ” The brutality of enslavement expressed itself through the denial of humanity , to be sure . But Hartman shows that it also happened through its admittance . For example , she describes two formerly enslaved Black men , Moses and Windham , who assert their humanity using language that would ultimately be used to strip away their rights to freedom . This language fortifies itself in case of law like Plessy v . Ferguson where a recognition of humanity makes possible the violent “separate - but - equal” ideology . Hartman argues that claims to humanity—and the very language of humanism—allow the mechanisms ( e . g . , laws , codes , legal frameworks ) that purport to free or liberate Black people from suffering to instead re - entrench that suffering . There seems , then , to be an insurmountable paradox : to address anti - Blackness we must try to eradicate its root cause , the ontological site from which it has emerged , which is a site of “pulver - ized being , abusive power , and systemized muteness” [ 91 , p . 9 ] . Yet , we cannot escape ontology , just hint at the spaces around it , never fully inhabiting them . This insurmountable paradox is not , however , a dead end . For if we must work within the constraints of ontology , we can still ( be ) hold it with a critical eye . In other words , the “problem” of Blackness and anti - Blackness—like the problem of ontology—does not call for a solution , since a solution would emerge from the same substrate that created the problem in the first place . “Black lives matter” not because they are rehabilitated within a fraught political ontology , but because they cannot be reduced to this framework , to this ontological orientation that “disregards and pulverizes black being” [ 91 , p . 25 ] . If , for a moment , we relax our grip on the solution and accept the problem’s double bind , we can start to see the blurry contours of another space , one in which we can recognize the violent nature of Western ontology while also living in it . 5 SOLUTIONS AND THEIR AFTERLIVES Now that we have explored the connections between the universalist problem - solving logic and the ontological paradox of Blackness , we want to examine the ontological status of the solution itself . The thinking that follows intentionally destabilizes and opens without presenting a path to follow . We believe that this approach offers a much - needed fragility and uncertainty ; rather than the map , it is the conditioning needed for the journey . 5 . 1 Re - Examining Solutions Returning to our introduction , we find Calvin Warren adds an additional conceptual register to interpretations of the solution . In calling productive responses to anti - Black racism momentary and fleeting – as interventions that , at best , give violence against Black lives a new formulation ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI 20 : 11 [ 91 , p . 122 ] – he anticipates the emotional response of audience members that followed his talk . Reflecting on the ensuing panic in the room , Warren expands on the idea of the solution itself : “it is not just that solutions make us feel good because we feel powerful / hopeful , but that pressing the ontological question presents terror – the terror that ontological secu - rity is gone , the terror that ethical claims no longer have an anchor , and the terror of inhabiting existence outside the precincts of humanity and its humanism . ” [ 91 , p . 4 ] Warren’s profound disruption to the solution stands as a reminder that solutions are woven into and across wider frameworks of being . Such frameworks , as we have seen above , hinge on specific reductions and limit the attention to specific endpoints . They limit what we can know and what we do with what we know – in other words , they have epistemic implications . For HCI scholars and designers , the stakes and positions that come with these reductions and endpoints shape the possibilities for experiencing and comprehending the myriad relationships within technological development . Put simply , the frameworks of being we in HCI and design inhabit foreclose the possibilities and set limits on what we are able to both imagine and do . It is the “terror” though , that Warren invites us to face , that forces the more profound line of questions ? As with Warren’s audience , the consequences of this terror leave HCI spiraling . Is any action or solution designed to respond to and remedy large - scale structural inequities destined to fail ? Will all solutions create or prolong the conditions for harm ? What could it possibly mean for HCI and design – and their solutions – when the only option left is to inhabit existences outside security , ethical anchors , humanity , hope , and ontology ? Such a dismantling of solutions and their framing lives at the intersection of statements such as “Yes we can ! ” ( former U . S . President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign slogan ) which saturated racially - ambivalent hope for a better future [ 64 ] and “Black Lives Matter , ” the rallying cry of move - ments fighting anti - Black violence and police brutality . Obama’s campaign slogan speaks of pos - sibility , while the latter Warren argues “is really an unanswered ( or unanswerable ) question” – exposing the contradictions inherent in the movement . For Warren , the hazy and slippery tension that surfaces between such slogans provokes de - manding and penetrating questions of Blackness . What can a statement like “Black Lives Matter” mean in the context of a society that has systematically denied Blackness an ontological status ? Can a solution to anti - Black racism and brutality operate outside of ontology altogether ? War - ren’s question , “what ontological ground provides the occasion for the declaration [ Black Lives Matter ] ? ” forces his readers and us , HCI researchers and designers , to consider the possibility that ontologies , and the solutions imagined within them , offer no way out . 5 . 2 Abandoning Problems ( and Recognizing the Terror They Pose for Design ) What we in design research should learn from Warren – if we can , like him , engage the unruly con - nections between solutions and ontologically - denied Blackness – requires revisiting our path so far . We have seen that solutions come with problems . And that , in working on solutions , designers put to work a wider set of stakes and positions that at the same time shape and respond to the gov - erning structures in which they live . What Warren’s proposal invites is the inspection of solutions from both inside and outside of frameworks of being . Scholars within and outside HCI [ 5 , 23 , 89 ] have begun to show that solutions engage frame - works that presume a lot : that designers have the means at their disposal to change the conditions that prolong racial inequities , that designers might work towards solutions that “translate into freedom , justice , recognition , or resolution . ” The hope here is one of resolving the problem . A reimagined solution might mean taking two concrete steps : ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . 20 : 12 J . Cunningham et al . ( 1 ) Splitting the problem from the solution . This is to break the problem - solution pairing that solutionism has depended upon . ( We have seen this implicit in the parody of willful acts of undesign , nondesign , and so on . , e . g . , [ 9 , 68 , 69 , 78 ] ) ( 2 ) Examining the problem without a solution . This is to see the problem free from the shadow of the solution . ( Something Rittel and Webber tried but fell short of achieving ) . To follow these steps is to insist on our willingness to hold accounts that chafe or wear down the present moment . Likewise , it means to trust that we in HCI and design are able to take re - sponsibility for the stakes we decide upon and the positions we take in such a present . But , from Warren , we learn that , even if it all goes well , it will likely give us only temporary reprieve . The frameworks we so unevenly operate within , and the instruments we enlist to set the possibility of change in motion , will be the same ones that underlay the injustices—the “vicious and tortuous cycle” Warren decries . To decouple the solution from the problem and then to free oneself from it ( from the solution ) leaves the framework of being intact . It is to remain within the precincts . The option left to us—seeking an outside to frameworks of being—is the radical one : ( 3 ) Examining the solution without the problem . This is a refusal to see a solution to a problem or treat a solution as if problems must exist . With hesitance—acknowledging the relentless questions that Warren uses to push us to keep probing—we want to pose this option as a question : “what if operating outside a framework of being , an ontology , could mean working towards a solution without its problem ? ” The imaginary this question opens up is one in which solutions are not just outside possibility but without pos - sibility . Sought after , here , is a fragile opening , one that could offer the conditions for refusing existences that set the conditions for possibility . This undoing—the solution devoid of problems that might not exist , cannot exist , or must not exist—exposes the limits and assumptions of control over the worlds that HCI and design help cultivate and shape . It seeks to situate research and design in a process that resists ideas such as anything we do will continue to exist or anything we have made can be altered [ 91 , p . 24 , p . 172 ] . Without the security of the problem and within the destabilizing ( possibly terrifying ) precincts of ontology , it presents a basis , not for processes of fixing but of collectively making do , again , and again , and again . Within HCI , critical frameworks of Afrofuturism , speculative design , and Black feminism have generatively framed design practices beyond the problem - solution pair – outlining forms of creativ - ity , imagination , and expression that collectively envision the world differently from how it is today [ 21 , 22 , 42 , 46 ] . Putting these ideas into practice , approaches like Participatory Action Research ( PAR ) and Community - Based Participatory Research ( CBPR ) make room for shifting the lo - cus of power within decision - making and problem - framing from those outside the stakes ( design - ers ) to those inside ( community ) [ 37 , 44 , 67 ] . In this work , scholars have critically engaged concepts such as “giving voice , ” “empowering , ” “empathy - building” and “placing participants in the driver’s seat , ” showing how they still sometimes operate within a problem - solution pairing that separates research from action and allows designers to hold fast to interpretive power [ 14 , 45 , 48 , 61 , 70 ] . What we take from Warren’s proposal is not a retooling of existing HCI approaches , but a possible philosophical extension to galvanize . It is to see design—and a legacy of inequity that correlates with its practice—as always developing within a hermeneutic world it must also revise ( adjust , engage , contend with ) . While prevalent among some scholars , we see how threatening it could be for others in HCI and design to leave behind something so fundamental to their beliefs and hopes . That this abandoning of the problem might present a kind of risk , a terror even , connected with ontological instability . To ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . On the Grounds of Solutionism : Ontologies of Blackness and HCI 20 : 13 remove the problem seems to remove the grounding from solutions . As prior HCI scholarship has described [ 38 , 44 , 67 ] , many invested in interaction and its design are left with nothing to hang on to . A response might be to query , laugh possibly , at the absurdity of it . How can we work without a problem ? Where should we begin ? Who am I designing for ? Who or what should I center ? What does success look like for different stakeholders—how is it defined ? How do we know when we have finished ? Why am I doing this ? These are precisely the questions that we need to be asking to think differently about solutions . This is how we might begin to undo solutions , and think about the just and equitable lives we might , just might , make possible . 6 CONCLUSION : TOWARD A LIFE OTHERWISE “How can the very system that is designed to unmake and inscribe her also be the one to save her ? ” — Christina Sharpe , In the Wake [ 79 ] Across design research , there seems to be an urgency to make things better . Automated credit - scoring systems are programmed , from the ground up , to prejudice based on race and gender . Vi - sion algorithms perpetuate anti - Black racism with wrongful arrests . And the location and tracking technology produce racialized and ableist exclusions . In this pressing urge to act responsibly and change things for the better , those of us who build technology face a perceived need for solutions . Many of us seek solutions to problems without clear definitional boundaries and make declarations to unanswered or unanswerable questions . Underlying our search for answers and resolutions , a kind of solution - oriented thinking pervades our work—and has long pervaded our literature ( with names such as teleology , progressivism , solutionism , techno - determinism , and the technofix ) . De - signers are driven by a need to fix problems using technologies but those technologies so rarely seem to meet the challenge at hand . The uncomfortable truth is that design solutions , ostensibly proposed in response to individual and social needs , have become something of a lark for many of us working in design research . They have given many of us license to investigate virt ually any walk of life and build systems that , as design scholars like to see it , center people but , with distance , show limited and uncertain improvements to the conditions people , world - wide , live in . We make this claim not to lessen HCI’s accomplishments or lay blame , but to acknowledge a collective complicity in something that masks considerably more complex relationships that thread through technology - mediated lives , historically as well as in the present . When solutions are approached as end points , they suggest there is an answer that can shut down the surrounding controversies . Solutions calm the seas of any complexity by limiting what counts as the problem . In writing this article , our aim was to respond to this sense we and many of our colleagues have that what we are doing is not enough . That despite the significant contributions from HCI and UX , the technologies we help to build cause harm . The persistence of this , we have tried to argue , suggests a structural problem to ( HCI ) design . Structurally , we find the solutions feed into and further amplify worlds founded on exploitative and colonial logics . Thus , the case we make seeks to explicate a structural reading of problems and solutions . Through this reading , our aim was not to rehearse arguments against solutionism—it’s precisely such a rehearsal that we want to question . We have seen how design research has done consid - erable work to open up and complicate problems ( see [ 15 , 16 , 31 ] ) . To some extent , it has come to terms with the inherent complexities that arise with problems and their solutions [ 59 ] . Com - plementing these developments , our hope has been to show how the problem - solution pair per - sists , and that this persistence demands a wider engagement with ontology and its blind spots . We may have released the problem from a solution with approaches like discursive , critical , and ACM Transactions on Computer - Human Interaction , Vol . 30 , No . 2 , Article 20 . Publication date : April 2023 . 20 : 14 J . Cunningham et al . speculative design , but many still make sense of and organize their work in terms of resolution ( acknowledged by [ 80 ] ) . In this resolution – where design research operates in and in some cases cements an ontology – we find a direct link to Warren’s radical proposal . This link invites the pos - sibility of existences outside of ontology – the possibility of life otherwise .
