At a given resolution , an optimal exposure can be defined that maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio in the image . Using a 2 . 6 Å resolution single particle cryo - EM reconstruction of rotavirus VP6 , determined from movies recorded with a total exposure of 100 electrons / Å2 , we obtained accurate measurements of optimal exposure values over a wide range of resolutions . At low and intermediate resolutions our measured values are considerably higher than obtained previously for crystalline specimens , indicating that both images and movies should be collected with higher exposures than are generally used . We demonstrate a method of using our optimal exposure values to filter movie frames , yielding images with improved contrast that lead to higher resolution reconstructions . This ' high - exposure ' technique should benefit cryo - EM work on all types of samples , especially those of relatively low molecular mass .
