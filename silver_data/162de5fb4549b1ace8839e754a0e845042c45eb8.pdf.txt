Transcription requires dynamic chromatin con - figurationsbetweenpromotersandtheircorrespondingdistalregu - latory elements 2 . It is believed that their communication occurs within large discrete foci of aggregated RNA polymerases termed transcription factories in three - dimensional nuclear space 3 . However , the dynamic nature of chromatin connectivity has not been char - acterized at the genome - wide level . Here , through a chromatin interaction analysis with paired - end tagging approach 3 – 5 using an antibody that primarily recognizes the pre - initiation complexes of RNA polymerase II 6 , we explore the transcriptional interactomes of three mouse cells of progressive lineage commitment , including pluripotent embryonic stem cells 7 , neural stem cells 8 and neuro - sphere stem / progenitor cells 9 . Our global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately 40 , 000 long - range interactions , suggest preciseenhancer – promoterassociationsanddelineatecell - type - specific chromatin structures . Analysisofthecomplexregulatoryrepertoire showsthatthereareextensivecolocalizationsamongpromotersanddistal - acting enhancers . Most of the enhancers associate with pro - moters located beyond their nearest active genes , indicating that the linear juxtaposition is not the only guiding principle driving enhancer target selection . Although promoter – enhancer interac - tions exhibit high cell - type specificity , promoters involved in inter - actions are found to be generally common and mostly active among different cells . Chromatin connectivity networks reveal that the pivotal genes of reprogramming functions are transcribed within physical proximity to each other in embryonic stem cells , linking chromatin architecture to coordinated gene expression . Our study sets the stage for the full - scale dissection of spatial and temporal genome structures and their roles in orchestrating development . Gene regulatory networks are organized by spatial connectivity between distal regulatory elements ( DREs ) and their corresponding promoters 3 .

IncreasingevidencehasshownthatDREscanfunctionoverlongdistances 3 , even on a different chromosome 10 from their target genes . However , much of our current knowledge of cell - specific transcription regu - lation is based on extensive survey of DREs in the linear genome 2 , 11 , 12 . The direct delineation of genome - wide DRE – promoter interactions is still very limited , and how chromatin structure regulates transcription is largely unknown . To explore the promoter - associated chromatin interactomes , we used the RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) chromatin interaction analysis with paired - end tagging ( ChIA - PET ) approach 3 ( see Methods ) in three murine cell types : embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , neural stem cells ( NSCs ) andneurospherestem / progenitorcells ( NPCs ) . NSCsandNPCs are two widely used neural development models representing different commitment steps . NSCs are clonally derived early neural stem cells obtained by in vitro differentiation of ESCs 8 , whereas NPCs are neural progenitor cells derived ex vivo from the forebrain telencephalic region 9 . Further examination of their transcription profiles confirms their expected cellular origins ( Supplementary Information section 1 ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) efficiency and ChIA - PET library quality were evaluated ( Extended Data Fig . 1 and Supplemen - tary Information section 2 ) and the data were processed further to estimate reproducibility , noise and coverage ( Supplementary Infor - mation sections 3 , 4 ) . Non - chimaeric , uniquely mapped PETs were used to define three classes of genome - wide information : the RNAPII - associated binding sites and long - range intra - and interchromosomal interactionclusters ( ExtendedDataFig . 2andSupplementaryTable1 ) . Using two independent approaches—quantitative PCR analysis of chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) and DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) —we were able to validate the defined intra - and interchromosomal interactions ( Supplementary Information section 5 ) . In all we identified 40 , 000 RNAPII - bound interaction pairs present from a total of three cell types ( Supplementary Table 2 ) .

In ESCs , roughly half of the promoter - tethered interactions connect two promoters ( P – P ) , indicating the prevalence of promoter associa - tions in the nucleus . The other half is distributed among promoters connectingtoeitherintergenic ( 24 % ; P – inter ) orintragenic ( 20 % ; P – intra ) regions ( Fig . 1a ) . Similar profiles are also found in NSCs and NPCs ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . Through visual examination of these interac - tions , we identified many known enhancer – promoter ( E – P ) interac - tions , including the genic loci of Oct4 , Nanog , Phc1 and Lefty1 ( ref . 13 ) ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Thus , these promoter - centric connectivity maps reveal large numbers of putative enhancers through both the inter - and intragenic interacting loci . In total , we identified 8 , 309 , 4 , 463 and 3 , 649 putative DREs in ESCs , NSCs and NPCs , respectively . InESCs , thesedistallociexhibitenhancercharacteristics ; namelymono - methylatedhistoneH3lysine4 ( H3K4me1 ) enrichment ( P , 1 3 10 2 4 ) , occupancy by pluripotent transcription factors and co - activator p300 ( also known as Ep300 ) , as well as sequence conservation 14 ( Fig . 1b , c and Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . Furthermore , approximately half of the multiple - transcription - factor - binding loci ( MTL ) previously identified in ESCs 12 overlap with these distal interaction sites . These regions also share significant overlap ( P , 1 3 10 2 4 ) with occupancy of medi - ator , a protein complex known to be associated with enhancers 13 . Last , the expression levels of the genes involved in the RNAPII interactions are significantly higher than those with no detected interaction ( P # 2 . 2 3 10 2 16 ) , suggesting that their promoters are transcription - ally more active ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 3b ) . Interestingly , among all the putative enhancers captured by RNAPII - bound inter - actions , we found 563 potential ‘poised enhancers’ connecting to the bivalent promoters 15 . Poised enhancers in ESCs are thought to ‘prime’ genes for subsequent for cell - type - dependent transcription activity during development 16 . To directly confirm the in vivo enhancer activities of these non - promoter distal interaction loci , we carried out enhancer assays in transgenic zebrafish with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) reporter genes 17 . Eleven out of 21 selected putative DRE loci drove reproducible and specific GFP expression patterns , indicating their spatiotemporal enhancer activity in zebrafish . ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Table 3 and SupplementaryInformationsection6 ) . Amongthem , apoisedenhancer of tcf12 , a neuronal developmental gene , shows no activity at early developmental stages but displays forebrain - specific activity at later developmental stages in zebrafish ( Fig . 2d ) . Likewise in mouse , this locus is associated with the bivalent promoter , is bound by Suz12 and exhibits repressive trimethylated H3K27 ( H3K27me3 ) modification in ESCs . This locus subsequently acquires p300 binding in NSCs and in correlation with high Tcf12 expression ( reads per kilobase per million reads ( RPKM ) 7 , 119 and 75 in ESCs , NSCs and NPCs , respectively ) . Taken together , these distal interacting loci presumably not only func - tion as developmental regulators but also retain their targeting specifi - cities across different vertebrates . These putative E – P interactions defined by ChIA - PET were used to decipher the nature of regulatory elements and their targeted gene associations in mouse stem cells . Being different from many previous studies that assumed proximity as the governing rule for E – P associa - tions 11 , our data suggest that a substantial fraction of these putative enhancers do not select their nearest promoters as their targets . In ESCs , 76 % of the putative enhancer nodes interact beyond their closest active genes . Among them , 40 % associated with interchromosomal interactions and 36 % were involved in intrachromosomal interactions ( Fig . 3a ) . Similar results were found in NSCs ( 77 % ) and NPCs ( 54 % ) . Distal targeting has been reported in selected cases 10 , 18 . Our data sug - gestthatthiscouldbeapervasivephenomenonthroughoutthegenome . Besides long - range targeting , putative E – P interactions also exhibit high specificity for targeted genes and cell types . In all three cell types examined , 60 – 70 % of the total RNAPII - tethered promoters are assoc - iated with only one distinct putative enhancer ( E : P ratio 5 1 ) and over 90 % ofthepotentialenhancerlociareassociatedwithonlyonetargeted gene ( P : Eratio 5 1 ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 list the numbers of enhancers and promoters associated with each of theircorresponding partner nodes ineach cell type . Among the cell - specific interactions , the putative E – P interactions are the most prevalent type , suggesting that cell - specific genes targeted by their corresponding enhancers are the most distinctive features of the RNAPII - mediated chromatin interactions ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . For example , Otx1 and Meis2 , key forebrain - expressed homeobox genes , are con - nected with their cell - specific enhancers in NPCs , but not in NSCs . By contrast , NSCs contain specific E – P interactions involving genes expressed in the more posterior neuraxis , early development and in response to FGF2 / EGF - like Adam12 , VAV3 and Hoxa ( Extended Data a P – E 43 % P – P 44 % E – E 13 % 36 % 40 % 24 % Interchromosomal Intrachromosomal Distal TSS Nearest TSS E P P P E E RNAPII - anchored non - promoter nodes ES : 254 NS : 259 NP : 271 6 , 991 E S ( 8 , 309 ) ( 84 % ) NS : 478 NP : 471 ES : 268 NP : 270 2 , 637 ( 72 % ) 2 , 920 ( 65 % ) ES : 796 NS : 806 N S ( 4 , 463 ) NP ( 3 , 649 ) ESC NSC NPC b Cell types No . promoter nodes % E : P ratio % among cell types 1 : 1 ≥2 : 1 % 1 : 1 % ≥2 : 1 Common 2 , 030 33 626 1 , 404 31 69 ESC and NSC 1 , 068 18 521 547 49 51 ESC and NPC 422 7 230 192 55 45 NSC and NPC 540 9 276 264 51 49 ESC only 1 , 229 20 905 324 74 26 NSC only 448 7 390 58 87 13 NPC only 355 6 301 54 85 15 Total 6 , 092 c Figure 3 | Characterization of putative enhancer – promoter targeting . a , Distributions of P – P , E – E and E – P interactions in ESCs ( left ) and interchromosomal , intrachromosomal with nearest promoters and intrachromosomal with distal targeting promoters ( right ) .

When all the interacting promoter and distal non - promoter nodes are compared separately , only a low percentage of the potential enhancers but a high percentage of the promoter nodes over - lap among the three cell types ( Fig . 3b , c ) , suggesting that the putative enhancers are mostly cell - type - specific but their targeted genes are largely common . When the cell - specific nature of these promoters was evaluated together with their interaction specificity , cell - specific promoters were found to be largely ( 74 – 87 % ) monogamous ( E – P ratio of 1 : 1 ) , whereas the universally expressed promoters are mostly ( 69 % ) promiscuous ( E – P ratioof $ 2 : 1 ) ( Fig . 3c ) . SupplementaryTable8 lists the 6 , 092 interacting promoter nodes found in all three cell types , their cell specificity and enhancer connectivity , and examples are shown in Extended Data Fig . 7 . Therefore , we speculate that distinct regulatory elements are used to target ubiquitously expressed genes in different cell types and such widespread differential enhancer usage not only functions to upregulate target genes but can also serve as a distinct mode to organize cell - specific transcription regulatory networks . Toevaluatewhethertranscriptionregulatorycircuitryisreflectedbythe cell - specific chromatin organization , we explored the spatial chromatin connectivity of core reprogramming genes 19 ( Pou5f1 , Nanog , Lin28a , Sox2 , Klf4 and Myc ) in ESCs through the RNAPII interaction maps . The expression of these key reprogramming genes is known to govern pluripotency in ESCs through coordinated autoregulatory loops 20 . Using connectivity analysis , three Klf genes ( Klf1 , Klf2 and Klf4 ) were found to directly link to Sox2 ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . When the network analysis was extended from one to two hops of connectivity , all of the reprogramming genes were found to be connected within one major hub , except for Myc and Lin28a ( Fig . 4a ) , suggesting that they could be colocalized in the nucleus within the same ‘transcriptional factory’ . Amongthem , Nanog and Pou5f1 havelimitedconnectededges whereas Sox2 has extensive connectivity . Sox2 can reprogram somatic cells to ESCs or NSCs 21 . In ESCs , the Sox2 promoter connects to clusters of ESC - specific enhancers to other pluripotency related genes like Sall1 , Asf1b , Dusp6 and Jund ( Fig . 4b ) . InNSCs , averydifferent Sox2 connectivityprofileisobserved ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . Such cell - specific connectivity is mediated through dif - ferential enhancer usage .

As shown , Olig1 and Olig2 are directly connected to many genes critical for neuronal development in NSCs , including neuropilin ( Neto2 ) , Fabp7 and Bsg . RNAPII – chromatin interacting complexes captured here result from pre - initiation events and not all of them will proceed to active transcription or elongation 24 . Therefore , the rich repertoires of in vivo chromatin interactions presumably comprise a mixture of promoters withvarioustranscriptionalactivities . Usingthewealthofother genome - wide transcriptionand epigeneticdata sets , one can further discriminate the transcription states of the identified interacting promoters and derive the significance of different ‘transcription factories’ . Our current study illustrates the complexity and dynamics of the underlyingchromatinstructuresinthenucleus ; however , werecognize that not all the interactions are functional . With additional ChIA - PET analysesfromvariousformsofRNAPII , deepersequencingandincreased coverage , we expect to capture more promoter - mediated interaction pairs and diverse types of regulatory elements . Before concluding new insights and principles , any functional model made solely from colo - calization association has to be examined together with other inte - grated ( epi ) genomic information and requires extensive functional validations , like the zebrafishtransgenicassays orgenome editing tools like CRISPR / Cas 25 . Finally , we expect that the recapitulation of such structure - based framework on a greater diversity of cell types and its integrated analyses shall further elucidate the mechanisms driving genome re - configuration , and to what extent it contributes to tran - scriptional regulation and cell specification .

Mouse E14 ESCs were cultured under feeder - free conditions in DMEM supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( ESC - qualified ; Invitrogen ) , 0 . 055mM b - mercaptoethanol ( Invitrogen ) , 2mM L - glutamine , 0 . 1mMnonessen - tial amino acids , 5 , 000Uml 2 1 penicillin / streptomycin and 1 , 000Uml 2 1 of leuk - aemia inhibitory factor ( Chemicon ) and maintained at 37 u C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were passaged every 2 – 3days using accutase ( GIBCO - BRL ) 12 . Mouse neural stem cellsNS5weremaintainedandpassagedwithtrypsin / EDTAorPBS . Thecellswere split 1 : 3 to 1 : 5 every 2 – 3 days as described 8 . P0 brain - derived neurosphere cells ( NPC ) cultures were obtained from dissected telencephalons of four mice as described previously 9 , plated in 25 - ml flasks and cultured to expand their number in complete medium ( 2 % ( vol / vol ) B27 in DMEM F12 with Glutamax ) , supple - mented with 10ngml 2 1 EGF , 10ngml 2 1 of basic fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) with 0 . 2 % ( vol / vol ) heparin . Cells were passaged two times , every fourth day ( by 0 . 25 % trypsin treatment for 5min , followed by block with 1mgml 2 1 trypsin inhibitor ( Sigma T6522 ) for 5min ) . Neurospheres were then dissociated and cells were seeded at 80 , 000 per ml in T150 flasks , and expanded by passaging every 4days in complete medium with EGF , but not FGF and heparin , for 3 – 5 passages until they reached 1 3 10 9 in number . To confirm that these cells were telence - phalic , we further verified expression of some critical telencephalic markers . The neurospheres were then collected , mechanically dissociated and crosslinked for ChIA - PET experiments as described below . ChIA - PET experiments . The ChIA - PET assay was performed as previously described 5 using a monoclonal antibody against the hypophosphorylated form of RNAPII ( 8WG16 , Covance ) . The cells were cross - linked and the pellets were then snap - frozen innitrogen . The crosslinked cells were lysed toreleasethe chromatin – DNAcomplexesfollowedbyfragmentationtoanaveragesizeof300basepairs ( bp ) . The sonicated chromatin – DNA complexes were incubated with the antibody - coated magnetic Protein G beads to immunoprecipitate targeted chromatin – DNA complexes . To determine the ChIP quality , a small portion of ChIP DNA was eluted for quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analysis . For ChIA - PET library construction , ChIP - enrichedchromatincomplexeswerepolishedanddividedintotwoaliquots . Todistinguishtheintramolecularproximityligationproductsfromthe chimaeras resulting from non - specific intermolecular ligations , two different barcoded bio - tinylated half - linkers ( linker A and linker B ) were designed 26 and were ligated to the ends of polished bead - bound - DNAfragmentsandused to join thejuxtaposed chromatin regions . The half - linker - ligated chromatin – DNA fragments were pooled for phosphorylation and proximity - based circularization . MmeI was sub - sequently used to release the paired - end tags ( PETs ) that contained internal bar - code information . The full - lengthlinkers ( AA / BB ) resulting from intra - molecular circularization were considered to be non - chimaeric PETs . Conversely , the het - erozygous full linkers ( AB / BA ) resulting from intermolecular ligation were con - sidered to be ligation noises . The biotin - labelled PET constructs were amplified and subjected for sequencing analysis . ChIA - PET data processing . The sequence data were analysed using the ChIA - PET tool 26 . In brief , non - redundant PET sequence reads were first analysed for linker barcode composition and classified as heterodimer AB or BA linkers , or homodimer AA or BB linkers . Next , the linker sequences were trimmed and the PET sequences were mapped to the mouse reference genome ( mm9 ) with up to two mismatches allowed . If a single exact match is obtained , that location is taken as the mapping location of the tag , and the tag is classified as ‘unique mapping’ . If multiple exact matches are obtained , the tag is classified as ‘multiple mappings’ . If no exact match is obtained for the tag , a mapping is done with one mismatch allowed , and the result is similarly labelled as ‘unique mapping’ or ‘multiple map - pings’ . Theprocessisrepeatedwithtwomismatches . Ifthereisstillnomappingfor a tag with two mismatches , the tag is finally classified as ‘non - mappable’ . Only those PETs with both tags uniquely mapped to the reference genome were con - sidered for further analyses . To further verify that the interactions from the chi - maeric PETs were mostly non - specific noise , we performed heat - map analysis to visualize the relationship between PET counts and span of intrachromosomal interactions from chimaeric and non - chimaeric PETs , respectively . As expected to result from random circularization noise , most of the interactions generated by chimaeric PETs were low PET counts and the interaction spans were largely greater than 1megabase ( Mb ) . Conversely , most of the non - chimaeric PETs were short spans across the genome and the interactions spanned less than 1Mb . The PETswithgenomiclocations frombothhead and tailtagswithin2bpwere further merged to filter the redundancy arising from clonal PCR amplification . The one with largest head coordinate was chosen as the representative genomic coordinates . Usingthemappingcriteriadefinedabove , theuniquelymapped , non - chimaeric PETs were used for further classification as interchromosomal , intra - chromosomalandself - ligationPETs . Inter - chromosomalPETsweredefinedasthe headandtailofthePETsmappedontodifferentchromosomes . Intrachromosomal PETs were defined as the head and tail of the PETs mapped onto the same chromosome with a genomic distance of . 8kb . Self - ligation PETs were defined as the head and tail of the PETs mapped onto the genomeof # 8kb and repre - sented ChIP DNA self - circularization . The span distance cut - off between self - ligation and intrachromosomal intermolecular ligation PETs was determined using log - log plot analysis of the span distribution on the PET mapping . A clustering approach was used to identify specific chromatin interactions . On thebasisofsonicatedchromatinfragmentsizes , individualPETmappinglocations were extended 1 . 5kb 3 9 and the PETs that overlapped at both ends formed inter - action PET clusters . We adopted the hypergeometric model for P value calcula - tions . Such a model takes into consideration the tag counts from both the anchor regions and the sequencing depth to determine reliable interactions , and a false discovery rate cutoff of 0 . 05 was used . Finally , we performed random shuffling simulations to evaluate the correlation between noise level and PET cluster counts . ThesimulationbrokedownthepairingrelationshipofdifferentPETclustersandthetagswererandomlypairedtogeneratesimulatedPETs . Todeterminethenoiselevel , we further compared the interaction numbers between simulations versus experi - mental data and chose the PET cluster counts that kept the noise level below 10 % . 3C - qPCRand DNA - FISHvalidation . In3C - qPCR , threedifferentcontrolswere used to normalize the qPCR data . First , control templates from bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) DNA spanning validated regions of interest were generated that contained all possible interactions . These control fragments were used to correct the PCR background of each primer set in the qPCR reactions , to evaluate the primer efficiency and to determine the minimal amount of ligation products . Quantification of these ligation products requires an ‘’anchor primer’ ( A ) located in one of the interaction anchors , combined with a battery of ‘test primers’ ( T ) designed from multiple candidate interacting regions of the locus . Second , to determine the restriction enzyme digestion efficiency , the undigested genomic DNA ( UND ) was used as a control in qPCR comparison with digested DNA ( D ) . Ct values from qPCR were used to calculate the digestion efficiency : % restric - tion 5 100 – 100 / 2 ‘ ( ( CtR 2 CtC ) D 2 ( CtR 2 CtC ) UND ) . C refers to PCR - amp - lified control regions containing no restriction sites of interest , and R refers to PCR - amplifiedregions across each restrictionsite ofinterest . The efficiency ofthe digestion was above 80 % . Third , a control locus from the ubiquitously expressed Ercc3 genewas usedtocheckthequalityofeach3Cassay . Thislocuswasalso used to distinguish relatively frequency between non - functional interactions and physiologically relevant interactions . The values were calculated using the para - metersofthestandardcurve ( b : intercept ; a : slope ) asfollows : value 5 10 ( Ct 2 b ) / a . AfterqPCR wasdone with differentsets primers , relative crosslinkingfrequencies werefurthercalculatedby : relativeinteractionfrequencies 5 value / ( value _ ERCC3 ) . The final result was plotted by their locations to the control anchor versus the relative interaction frequencies . A specific interaction wasconfirmedwhen a local peak in interaction frequency was observed . For DNA - fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) experiments , E14 mouse ESCs were checked first for their karyotypes to ensure cell quality . Cells grown to 70 % confluence were collected by standard hypotonic treatment and acid fixation followed by permeabilization . Next , the cells were fixed in 1 % formaldehyde ( Sigma ) for 10min , followed by dehydration in an ethanol series . To prepare the probe , BAC DNA was labelled with either biotin - 16 - dUTP or digoxigenin - 11 - dUTP ( Roche ) aspermanufacturer’sinstruction . ThespecificityofBACprobes was determined by conducting FISH on 40 , XY mouse metaphase spreads and visualizing probes hybridization at the expected chromosomal regions . Experi - mentalprobemixconsistedoflabelledBACprobesforthetwointeractingregions . Control probe mix consisted of a biotin - labelled probe for one interaction region andanother controlregiononchromosome16 . Denaturedprobeswereappliedto denatured slides and hybridized at 37 u C overnight . Slides were washed , blocked withblockingreagent ( Roche ) , followedbyincubationwithantibodiesconjugated with FITC ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ) ( Roche ) and anti - digoxigenin - rhodamine ( Roche ) against the biotin - labelled or digoxigenin - labelled probes , respectively . DAPI ( 4 9 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) counterstain ( Vector Laboratories ) was then used to stain the nuclei to enable visualization . Slides were then scanned and fluorophores were imaged for fluorescein , rhodamine and DAPI ( Zeiss ) . Images obtained were analysed for fusion probe pairs ( distance between probe pairs , 1 . 12 m m ) and non - fusion probe pairs ( distance between probe pairs . 1 . 12 m m ) . Approximately300 – 500nuclei were analysed . Forstatisticalanalysis , two - sidedBinomialtestwasusedtodeterminethesignificance . Interactionstested were deemed as significant when the two - tailed P value was , 0 . 05 . RNA - seq analysis . Total RNA was isolated and purified from around 1 3 10 7 cells . Approximately 1 m g of mRNA was used for fragmentation with RNase III . Analysiswasperformedfollowingtheprotocol andreagent kitprovidedfrom Life Technologies Inc . , which generates strand - specific RNAreads analysed by SOLiD platform with 1 3 50bp in length .

A split - read mapping approach was also applied to map reads that spanned two exons . Uniquely mapped reads were used to calculate expression values obtained for all RefSeq genes . Expression values were deter - mined as RPKM for coding sequences . Zebrafish enhancer assays . Twenty - one putative DRE loci , including the three validatedelementsina mouseESCluciferaseassay , were selected ascandidateson the basis of their gene targets , presence of the p300 binding site , interaction spe - cificity and category , distance between interaction anchors and degree of conser - vation . One - kilobase regions centred around the peaks of the interacting loci were PCR amplified . PCR products were then cloned into the E1b - GFP vector 17 using either Gateway ( Life Technologies ) or InFusion cloning ( Clontech ) . The cloned reporter constructs were sequence verified and then injected into . 100 zebrafish one - cell - stage embryos per construct along with Tol2 mRNA to facilitate genomic integration . Green fluorescence was monitored at five early developmental stages : sphere ( 4hpf ) ) , 75 % epiboly ( 8hpf ) , 6 somite ( 12hpf ) , prim - 5 ( 24hpf ) and long pectoralfin ( 48hpf ) .
