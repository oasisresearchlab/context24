This paper reports on a case study of user behavior with marking menus in a real work situation . The study demonstrates that when users become expert , marks are used extensively and are on average 3 . 5 times faster than using the menu . However , expert users still occasionally switch back to menus to refresh their memory of menu layout .

An interface for entering text to a pen - based computer is described . The technique proposes a new alphabet , where each letter is a flick gesture . These flick gestures are self - disclosing using pie menus . An experiment determined the speeds of executing the flick gestures and the transition speeds between gestures . An assignment of characters to gestures is developed and evaluated . Audio feedback is used to convey whether a gesture was well - or badly - formed . A longitudinal study showed clear progress on a learning curve . The method is compared to soft keyboards , handwriting recognition systems , and unistrokes . 218
