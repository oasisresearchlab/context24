To 24 deconvolute this complexity , we reconstituted HSV - 1 fusion with synthetic lipid vesicles in 25 vitro . Using this simplified , controllable system , we discovered that HSV - 1 fusion required not 26 only a cognate host receptor but also low pH . On the target membrane side , efficient fusion 27 required cholesterol , negatively charged lipids found in the endosomal membranes , and an 28 optimal balance of lipid order and disorder . On the virion side , the four HSV - 1 entry 29 glycoproteins gB , gD , gH , and gL were sufficient for fusion . We propose that low pH is a 30 biologically relevant co - trigger for HSV - 1 fusion . The dependence of fusion on low pH and 31 endosomal lipids could explain why HSV - 1 enters most cell types by endocytosis . We 32 hypothesize that under neutral pH conditions , other , yet undefined , cellular factors may serve as 33 fusion co - triggers . The in - vitro fusion system established here can be employed to systematically 34 investigate HSV - 1 - mediated membrane fusion . 35 36 IMPORTANCE 37 Herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV - 1 ) causes life - long , incurable infections and diseases ranging from 38 mucocutaneous lesions to fatal encephalitis . Fusion of viral and host membranes is a critical step 39 in HSV - 1 infection of target cells that requires multiple factors on both the viral and host sides . 40 Due to this complexity , many fundamental questions remain unanswered , such as the viral and 41 host factors that are necessary and sufficient for HSV - 1 - mediated membrane fusion and the 42 nature of the fusion trigger . Here , we developed a simplified in - vitro fusion assay to examine the 43 fusion requirements and identified low pH as a co - trigger for virus - mediated fusion in vitro . We 44 hypothesize that low pH has a critical role in cell entry and , potentially , pathogenesis . 45 46 3 INTRODUCTION 47 Enveloped viruses must fuse their membranes with host cell membranes to initiate 48 infection . This process has a high kinetic barrier that is overcome by viral surface proteins called 49 membrane fusogens ( 1 ) . Membrane fusogens aid in overcoming the energetic barrier by forming 50 an extended structure that inserts into the host membrane and folds back on itself , bringing the 51 two membranes close enough together to fuse ( 2 , 3 ) . Fusogens are subject to temporospatial 52 regulation that ensures their deployment only when certain conditions are met , such as in the 53 presence of specific host cell factors , target membrane lipid composition , or environmental 54 triggers such as low pH of internal cellular compartments , or a combination thereof ( 4 , 5 ) . 55 Depending on the target host cell and the virus , said triggers determine when and where the viral 56 envelope will fuse with the host cell membrane to deliver the viral genome into the target host 57 cell . 58 Herpesviruses are double - stranded - DNA enveloped viruses that are endemic and establish 59 lifelong latent , reactivating infections ( 6 ) . The prototypical herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV - 1 ) 60 initially infects epithelial cells in the mucosa or the skin and uses retrograde transport in axons to 61 establish latency in the dorsal root ganglia ( 7 ) . HSV - 1 is found in at least two - thirds of the 62 world’s population ( 6 ) . In addition to oral and genital lesions , HSV - 1 can cause keratitis – a 63 major cause of blindness worldwide , and temporal lobe encephalitis ( 8 , 9 ) . 64 Herpesviruses penetrate target cells by fusing their lipid envelopes with a host cell 65 membrane . Their mechanisms for entry into the host cell are some of the most complex among 66 viruses because they employ a large number of viral glycoproteins and host receptors . In HSV - 1 , 67 entry - associated functions are distributed across four viral glycoproteins : gD , gH , gL , and gB 68 [ reviewed in ( 10 - 12 ) ] . According to the current model , these four viral glycoproteins orchestrate 69 membrane fusion through a sequential activation process termed regulatory cascade ( 13 ) 70 [ reviewed in ( 10 , 14 , 15 ) ] . First , the receptor - binding glycoprotein , gD , binds one of its three 71 cognate receptors on the surface of the host cell and undergoes a conformational change , 72 enabling it to bind and activate the gH / gL complex . The gH / gL complex , in turn , transmits the 73 activating signal from the receptor - bound gD to gB , a viral fusogen that mediates the merger of 74 the viral and host membranes . To add to this complexity , the HSV - 1 envelope contains twelve 75 other glycosylated and unglycosylated surface proteins ( 16 ) that could influence cell entry 76 [ reviewed in ( 17 ) ] . 77 4 On the host side , HSV - 1 engages a variety of host molecules for attachment , 78 internalization , and other entry - related functions , in a cell - specific manner [ reviewed in ( 17 ) ] . 79 Entry requires one of three entry receptors : nectin - 1 , a member of the immunoglobulin 80 superfamily that functions as a cell adhesion molecule ; the herpesvirus entry mediator ( HVEM ) , 81 a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ; or a 3 - O - sulfonated derivative of 82 heparan sulfate ( 3 - OS - HS ) [ reviewed in ( 18 ) ] . These three receptors are mutually independent 83 and do not function merely as attachment factors . Instead , they trigger a cascade of 84 conformational changes in the viral glycoprotein machinery described above . HSV - 1 then 85 utilizes distinct cell - type - dependent entry pathways , all of which require fusion of the viral 86 envelope with either the host plasma membrane ( 19 - 21 ) , the membrane of an endocytic vesicle , 87 or an endosome after internalization ( 22 - 27 ) . 88 But aside from the host receptors , the fusion requirements on the host side – proteins , 89 lipids , ions – have not yet been fully defined . Moreover , the question of what triggers fusion has 90 not yet been settled . HSV - 1 - mediated fusion is commonly thought to be triggered by binding to 91 one of the three host entry receptors ( receptor - triggered ) rather than by exposure to the low pH of 92 the endosomal compartment ( pH - triggered ) . This is because HSV - 1 enters certain cell types , 93 including neurons , by fusion at the plasma membrane , a process that occurs at neutral pH ( 19 - 94 21 ) . Likewise , robust cell - cell fusion is observed at neutral pH in uninfected cells overexpressing 95 HSV - 1 gB , gH , gL , and gD in the presence of a cognate receptor ( 28 , 29 ) . However , HSV - 1 96 enters some cell types , e . g . , primary human keratinocytes , by endocytosis and fusion with an 97 endosomal membrane ( 22 - 27 ) , and entry is sensitive to inhibitors of endosomal acidification 98 ( 30 ) . Low pH triggers fusion in many viruses that use the endocytic route of entry . Therefore , 99 low pH could , in principle , act as a potential fusion trigger in HSV - 1 . 100 Our current mechanistic models of HSV - 1 membrane fusion are primarily based on studies 101 of cell - cell fusion of uninfected cells overexpressing the four HSV - 1 entry glycoproteins . 102 However , the cell - cell fusion system , while informative , does not adequately recapitulate the 103 fusion of viral particles with target membranes due to differen ces in the geometry of the 104 opposing membranes , membrane composition , and possible contributions by the other viral 105 glycoproteins . Studying membrane fusion in the context of HSV - 1 infection provides a more 106 authentic system . However , such studies are confounded by the complex , dynamic nature of the 107 host cell and do not measure fusion directly because they utilize downstream reporters . 108 5 Therefore , studying HSV - 1 - mediated membrane fusion requires an experimentally tractable 109 system that recapitulates the important aspects of viral fusion and can be easily manipulated . 110 Here , we reconstituted the HSV - 1 fusion process for the first time in vitro with purified 111 virions and synthetic lipid vesicles of defined composition . Using this simplified , controllable 112 system , we discovered that HSV - 1 fusion required not only a cognate host receptor but also low 113 pH . We also found that on the target membrane side , efficient fusion required cholesterol , 114 negatively charged lipids found in the endosomal membranes , and an optimal balance of lipid 115 order and disorder . Finally , by using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus pseudotypes , we confirmed 116 that on the virion side , the four HSV - 1 entry glycoproteins gB , gD , gH , and gL were sufficient 117 for fusion . 118 We hypothesize that low pH is a biologically relevant fusion co - trigger for HSV - 1 . The 119 dependence of fusion on low pH and endosomal lipids could explain why HSV - 1 chooses the 120 endocytic route of entry into most cell types . Membrane fusion under neutral pH conditions – in 121 the context of cell entry at the plasma membrane or cell - cell fusion – may use other , yet 122 undefined , cellular factors as co - triggers . The in - vitro fusion system established here can be used 123 for further systematic exploration of HSV - 1 - mediated fusion . 124 125 RESULTS 126 The in - vitro fusion setup . Virion fusion with artificial membranes ( lipid vesicles or lipid 127 bilayers ) has been reconstituted for several viruses ( 31 - 43 ) . In a typical in - vitro fusion 128 experiment , virions or liposomes are labeled with either a lipophilic or an aqueous fluorescent 129 dye . Changes in fluorescence upon lipid mixing or content mixing report on membrane 130 hemifusion or full fusion , respectively . These can be due to the dequenching of a dye 131 incorporated at self - quenching concentrations , an increase or a decrease in FRET efficiency , or 132 changes in the fluorescence emission profile . Triggers of membrane fusion vary depending on 133 the virus and can include receptors , co - receptors , or environmental triggers such as pH or ions . 134 In our experiments , we chose to monitor content mixing , i . e . , the mixing of the viral 135 interior with that of the liposome , which reports on the full fusion of the opposing membranes . 136 This was done by incorporating an aqueous fluorophore , Sulforhodamine B ( SRB ) , into the 137 target liposomes at self - quenching concentrations ( Fig . 1A ) . Membrane fusion leads to mixing of 138 the viral and liposome interiors , which dilutes the aqueous fluorophore , causing it to de - quench 139 6 and emit higher fluorescence . An increase in fluorescence reports on content mixing ( Fig . 1B ) . 140 SRB was chosen as a reporter because it cannot traverse membranes and is not pH sensitive , 141 which allows monitoring of pH - triggered membrane fusion . It has been successfully used to 142 monitor in - vitro fusion for several viruses ( 35 , 37 ) . 143 To optimize the experimental setup , we used the Vesicular Stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , for 144 which the fusion requirements are well defined ( 44 , 45 ) and the in - vitro fusion conditions have 145 been established ( 42 , 46 - 48 ) . VSV - mediated fusion is triggered by acidification ( 49 - 52 ) . An 146 earlier study ( 42 ) that measured hemifusion by monitoring FRET between two lipophilic dyes 147 incorporated into target liposomes reported that VSV - mediated fusion in - vitro required 1 - 148 palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( POPS ) in target membranes , which may act 149 as a receptor ( 42 ) . Therefore , we used large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) composed of 33 % 1 - 150 palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , 16 . 7 % 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 151 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( POPE ) , 16 . 7 % POPS , and 33 % cholesterol ( POPC : POPE : POPS : Chol = 152 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 ) ( Table 1 : POPS ) ( 42 ) . In the same study , optimal fusion under in - vitro conditions was 153 observed at pH values < 5 . 6 ( 42 ) , so we tested a pH range between 5 . 0 and 7 . 4 . Lastly , to ensure 154 homogeneity , SRB - containing liposomes were evaluated for size and concentration by static 155 light scattering ( Supplementary Fig . S1A - C ) . 156 Purified VSV virions were mixed with SRB - labeled large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) in a 157 fluorescence cuvette , and the emission intensity of SRB was recorded as a function of time ( Fig . 158 1C and Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . Since absolute fluorescence emission values can vary across 159 liposome preparations , fusion values across different experiments were normalized . The initial 160 fluorescence emission intensity after virion and liposome mixing , but before triggering , was 161 defined as 0 % fusion ( Fig . 1C and Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . The detergent Triton X - 100 was 162 added at the end of each experiment to disperse the membranes and measure the fully 163 unquenched fluorescence emission intensity . This value was defined as 100 % fusion . In each 164 experiment , full fusion , i . e . , content mixing , was assessed by an increase in the emission 165 intensity due to SRB dequenching and normalized to fully unquenched fluorescence emission 166 intensity ( Supplementary Fig . 2A ) by using the equation : F normalized = F t - F i / ( F max - F i ) - 1 x 100 % , 167 where F t is fluorescence at time t , F i is initial fluorescence and F max is fluorescence after 168 treatment with Triton X - 100 . 169 7 To compare multiple data sets , the normalized values at the endpoint of each experiment , 170 which correspond to values just before the addition of Triton X - 100 , were averaged and plotted 171 as bar graphs ( Supplementary Fig . 2A ) . As expected , significant fluorescence emission 172 dequenching , ~ 40 - 45 % , indicative of fusion , was observed at pH values ≤ 5 . 5 ( Supplementary 173 Fig . 2A and 2B ) . At neutral pH , the fluorescence signal was much lower . These results were in 174 agreement with a previous study ( 42 ) despite the use of a different fluorescent reporter , SRB , 175 which reports on fusion instead of hemifusion and uses LUVs as opposed to small unilamellar 176 vesicles ( SUVs , r < 50nm ) . 177 178 HSV - 1 fusion in vitro requires both a receptor and low pH . Having validated the in - vitro bulk 179 fusion assay with VSV , we next moved on to HSV - 1 . HSV - 1 was propagated and titrated on 180 Vero cells . To ensure batch - to - batch consistency , HSV - 1 virions were purified by density 181 gradient centrifugation . HSV - 1 - infected cells typically produce not only virions but also particles 182 lacking capsids , which are known as light particles ( L - particles ) . Since L - particles have a 183 different glycoprotein composition ( 53 ) and may have different fusogenic requirements from the 184 virions , HSV - 1 virions were separated from L - particles by density gradient centrifugation using 185 a 10 - 50 % iodixanol gradient ( Supplementary Fig . S1D ) . The purified HSV - 1 virions were 186 analyzed and quantified using multi - angle light scattering ( MALS ) and dynamic light scattering 187 ( DLS ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1E - H ) . The typical particle radius was ~ 98 nm ( Supplementary 188 Fig . S1G ) and agreed with the previously reported range of 92 - 115 nm ( 54 , 55 ) . Particle counts 189 ( Supplementary Fig . S1E ) were used to calculate the particle - per - PFU ratios ( Supplementary 190 Fig . S1H ) . Only the virion preparations with the particle - to - PFU ratio of 20 - 30 were deemed to 191 be of sufficiently high quality ( 56 ) . 192 To measure HSV - 1 - mediated fusion , purified HSV - 1 virions were incubated with SRB - 193 labeled LUVs in a fluorescence cuvette . Initially , we used liposomes of the same composition as 194 in the VSV - mediated fusion experiment , 33 % POPC , 16 . 7 % POPE , 16 . 7 % POPS , and 33 % 195 cholesterol ( POPC : POPE : POPS : Chol = 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 ) ( Table 1 : POPS ) . Since HSV - 1 - mediated 196 fusion is receptor - triggered , we used the purified recombinant soluble ectodomain of HVEM , 197 HVEM200t - His 8 to trigger fusion ( Supplementary Fig . S3A ) . HVEM200t - His 8 was added to 198 the HSV - 1 / LUV mixture after incubation . However , at neutral pH , no significant SRB 199 dequenching was observed ( Fig . 2A and D ) . Since HSV - 1 enters most known target cell types 200 8 by pH - dependent endocytosis ( 10 , 11 , 57 , 58 ) , we tested pH ranging from pH 6 . 5 to 4 . 5 by 201 adding predetermined amounts of HCl after incubation with a soluble receptor . Upon 202 acidification in the presence of HVEM200t - His 8 , we observed robust fusion at pH < 5 . 5 , ~ 40 % 203 ( Fig . 2A and D ) . 204 Although POPS worked consistently in the in - vitro fusion experiments with VSV ( Fig . 1D 205 and E ) , with HSV - 1 , we observed variability in fluorescence at intermediate pH values such that 206 statistical significance was only achieved at pH 4 . 5 ( Fig . 2D ) , and biological replicates did not 207 have the same trend ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . Therefore , we replaced POPS with another 208 lipid with a negatively charged headgroup , bis ( monooleoylglycero ) phosphate ( BMP ) , which is 209 specific to late endosomes . The resulting liposomes contained 33 % POPC , 16 . 7 % POPE , 16 . 7 % 210 BMP , and 33 % cholesterol , ( POPC : POPE : BMP : Chol = 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 ) ( Table 1 : BMP ) . With the BMP 211 liposomes , robust fusion was observed at pH ≤ 5 . 0 ( Fig . 2B and E ) , just as with the POPS 212 liposomes ( Fig . 2A and D ) . However , in the presence of BMP , the fusion increased to 60 % , and 213 reproducibility improved , with fusion reaching statistical significance at pH values ≤ 5 . 5 ( Fig . 214 2E ) . Individual biological replicates had very similar trends ( Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . 215 To assess the potential contributions of liposome leakage , liposome rupture , or mechanical 216 perturbation due to stirring to the fluorescence signal , and to determine the optimal end - point 217 time for measurements , we tested the BMP liposomes ( Table 1 : BMP ) under conditions non - 218 permissive for fusion by leaving out one or more required components , e . g . , HSV - 1 , 219 HVEM200t - His 8 , or low pH ( Supplementary Fig . S5A ) . With LUVs alone at pH 7 . 4 , the final 220 dequenching values were below the baseline indicating moderate photobleaching instead of 221 fluorescence ( Supplementary Fig . S5 , brown ) . The addition of HVEM200t - His 8 or HSV - 1 to 222 the LUVs at pH 7 . 4 minimally increased the fluorescence signal ( Supplementary Fig . S5 , 223 orange and black , respectively ) to < 10 % after an hour . However , with LUVs at pH 5 . 0 , either 224 alone or in the presence of HVEM200t - His 8 , we detected a time - dependent increase in 225 fluorescence ( Supplementary Fig . S5 , green and red , respectively ) ~ 40 % , which indicated that 226 some liposome leakage or rupture was occurring at low pH . Under these conditions , the 227 fluorescent signal of ~ 20 % was the lowest at 5 min post - triggering ( Supplementary Fig . S5D , 228 green and red ) . Importantly , under conditions enabling fusion , i . e . , at pH 5 . 0 and in the presence 229 of both HSV - 1 and HVEM200t - His 8 , the fluorescence signal nearly plateaued at 5 min post - 230 triggering , reaching ~ 60 % ( Supplementary Fig . S5D , blue ) . Therefore , to minimize any 231 9 potential contributions of liposome leakage to the fluorescence signal , we chose 5 min post - 232 triggering as the endpoint for all subsequent in - vitro fusion measurements . Surprisingly , with 233 LUVs at pH 5 . 0 in the presence of HSV - 1 ( without HVEM200t - His 8 ) , the fluorescence signal 234 was minimal ( Supplementary Fig . S5 , purple ) with < 10 % fluorescence . This suggested that 235 liposome leakage caused by low pH was somehow mitigated by the presence of HSV - 1 , 236 effectively ruling out nonspecific liposome leakage as a significant contributor to the fusion 237 signal under fusion - permitting conditions . 238 We next tested fusion in the presence of the soluble ectodomain of another HSV - 1 receptor , 239 nectin - 1 , nectin345t - His 8 ( Supplementary Fig . S3B ) . Just as with HVEM200t - His 8 , significant 240 fusion was observed only upon acidification , with fusion extent reaching ~ 40 % at pH 4 . 5 ( Fig . 241 2C and F ) and having a consistent trend among biological replicates ( Supplementary Fig . 242 S4C ) . In the presence of nectin345t - His 8 , fusion was somewhat less efficient , ~ 40 % , compared 243 to ~ 60 % observed in the presence of HVEM200t - His 8 . Additionally , in the presence of 244 nectin345t - His 8 the highest fusion was observed at pH 4 . 5 instead of pH 5 . 0 . Despite these 245 differences , HSV - 1 - mediated fusion in vitro in the presence of either HVEM200t - His 8 or 246 nectin345t - His 8 required low pH . 247 The differences in fusion extent between the two receptors could be due to the differences 248 in fusion rates or fusion efficiency . To resolve these alternate possibilities , we calculated the 249 fusion rate constants for fusion in the presence of HVEM200t - His 8 or nectin345t - His 8 at pH 4 . 5 250 or 5 . 0 by fitting the normalized data using analyses built into GraphPad PRISM9 251 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Single exponential functions did not fit the data , so the two - phase 252 ( exponential ) association was used instead , which yielded two rate constants , k fast and k slow . Of 253 the two , k fast is the more relevant parameter because it describes the rate of the fast exponential 254 component , which likely specifically represents the fusion process , whereas k slow could represent 255 the rate of a slow background process or the nonspecific dequenching observed in negative 256 controls . k fast was relatively similar across the conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 7A ) . This 257 suggests that the fusion mechanism is the same regardless of the receptor , which is consistent 258 with the current model [ reviewed in ( 10 , 14 , 15 ) ] . Therefore , we hypothesize that the differences 259 in fusion extent in the presence of HVEM200t - His 8 or nectin345t - His 8 are due to differences in 260 fusion efficiency . 261 262 10 Incubation of HSV - 1 with a soluble receptor and low pH reduces its infectivity . Fusion triggers 263 activate viral fusogens by inducing a conformational change that causes the active , prefusion 264 form to refold into the inactive , postfusion form ( 1 ) . If the fusogen is triggered in the absence of 265 a target membrane , it will refold into the postfusion form unproductively , which would 266 effectively inactivate it . Therefore , if receptor and low pH functioned as co - triggers of the HSV - 267 1 fusogenic machinery , then pre - treatment of HSV - 1 with both co - triggers in the absence of the 268 target membrane would inactivate it , thereby reducing the viral titer . Indeed , pre - treatment of 269 HSV - 1 with HVEM200t - His 8 and low pH reduced its infectivity significantly , in a pH - dependent 270 manner ( Fig . 3 ) , HVEM200t - His 8 was tested because it had the most robust dequenching and 271 would be used for other experiments . In contrast , pre - treatment of HSV - 1 with HVEM200t - His 8 272 at pH 7 . 4 or in the absence of receptor at pH 5 . 0 , had a minimal , statistically insignificant effect 273 on infectivity ( Fig . 3 ) . While the optimal pH for HSV - 1 inactivation , pH 4 . 5 ( Fig . 3 ) , was lower 274 than the optimal pH for in - vitro fusion , pH 5 . 0 ( Fig . 2D ) , this discrepancy could be due to the 275 differences between the two experimental setups . In the infection experiment , HSV - 1 was 276 incubated with HVEM200t - His 8 at low pH for 1 hour in the absence of target cells . By contrast , 277 in the in - vitro fusion experiment , HSV - 1 was incubated with HVEM200t - His 8 and target LUVs 278 for 10 min before acidification , at which point the reaction was triggered by shifting the pH and 279 monitored for 5 minutes . Regardless , both HSV - 1 inactivation and in - vitro fusion require the 280 presence of both HVEM200t - His 8 and low pH . 281 282 In - vitro HSV - 1 - mediated fusion requires a lipid with a negatively charged headgroup and 283 cholesterol in the target membrane . To dissect the lipid requirements for HSV - 1 - mediated 284 fusion in vitro , we systematically eliminated POPE , BMP , and cholesterol from target LUVs by 285 replacing them with the equivalent amounts of POPC ( Table 1 : no POPE , no BMP , no Chol ) . 286 Omission of BMP or cholesterol reduced fusion by ~ 6 - fold whereas omission of POPE did not 287 ( Fig . 4 ) Both BMP and POPS have negatively charged headgroups , and both supported HSV - 1 288 fusion at similarly high levels , on average ( Fig . 2A , B , D , and E ) . To test if other lipids with a 289 negatively charged headgroup could support HSV - 1 fusion , we tested 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - 290 glycero - 3 - phosphate ( POPA ) . POPA supported fusion at ~ 2 - fold lower level than BMP or POPS 291 ( Fig . 4 ) . We conclude that HSV - 1 - mediated in - vitro fusion requires a lipid with a negatively 292 charged headgroup on the target membrane side and that BMP and POPS are better than POPA . 293 11 Negatively charged lipids or cell surface glycosaminoglycans can act as initial attachment 294 factors or receptors through electrostatic interactions ( 59 , 60 ) . We hypothesized that if BMP 295 mediated HSV - 1 attachment to the target membranes similarly , then displaying HVEM on the 296 surface of the LUVs would bypass this requirement by allowing HSV - 1 to attach to the LUVs by 297 using gD / HVEM interaction . To achieve this , we turned to DGS - NTA , a Ni - chelating lipid that 298 can be used , in conjunction with Ni , to anchor His - tagged proteins to liposomes ( 61 , 62 ) . We 299 tested LUVs with or without BMP containing 3 % DGS - NTA - Ni ( Table 1 : BMP 3 % DGS - 300 NTA - ( Ni ) , No BMP 3 % DGS - NTA - ( Ni ) ) . Unfortunately , we found that adding DGS - NTA - Ni 301 to LUVs reduced fusion levels to < 25 % regardless of the BMP presence ( Supplementary Fig . 302 S6 ) . Therefore , the role of the negatively charged lipid in HSV - 1 fusion remained unclear . 303 Efficient in - vitro fusion also required cholesterol in the target LUVs ( Fig . 4 ) . Cholesterol 304 is an important component of almost all cellular membranes and is required for the fusion of 305 many enveloped viruses ( 40 , 41 , 63 - 70 ) . We compared fusion in the presence of 0 % , 17 % , 33 % , 306 or 50 % cholesterol ( Table 1 : No Chol , 17 % Chol , 33 % Chol ( BMP ) , 50 % Chol ) and found 307 33 % cholesterol to be the optimal amount ( Fig . 4 ) producing ~ 60 % fluorescence . Fluorescence 308 in the presence of 17 % cholesterol was reduced to ~ 40 % , indicating reduced fusion levels , but 309 this decrease was not statistically significant ( Fig . 4 ) . 310 311 Efficient HSV - 1 - mediated fusion in vitro requires a balance of lipid order and fluidity . The 312 levels of HSV - 1 - mediated fusion in vitro depended on the amount of cholesterol in the target 313 membrane . 17 or 33 % cholesterol supported efficient fusion at ~ 40 % and 60 % fluorescence , 314 respectively , whereas 0 or 50 % cholesterol did not ( Fig . 4 ) , reducing fusion to ~ 30 % and ~ 10 % , 315 respectively . In synthetic membranes , cholesterol has been shown to promote the formation of 316 the liquid - ordered phase ( L o ) , sometimes referred to as lipid rafts , that co - exists with the liquid - 317 disordered phase ( L d ) ( 71 - 75 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that HSV - 1 - mediated fusion in vitro 318 is influenced by membrane fluidity and lipid order . 319 To assess the relative amounts of L o and L d phases in our LUV preparations , we used the 320 solvatochromic fluorescent dye 2 - dimethylamino - 6 - lauroylnaphtalene ( Laurdan ) . Laurdan can 321 partition into L d and L o phases but changes its fluorescence emission maximum from 440 nm 322 ( L o ) to 490 nm ( L d ) , which makes it a useful reporter for L o / L d transitions [ reviewed in ( 76 ) . 323 Laurdan fluorescence emission in membranes is typically expressed as generalized polarization 324 12 ( GP ) = ( I 440nm - I 480nm ) / ( I 440nm + I 480nm ) - 1 , where I is the fluorescence intensity at the indicated wavelength 325 ( actual peak values differ by the system but are usually within a few nm of 440nm and 480nm ) . 326 Higher GP values indicate higher lipid order , i . e . , L o > L d , whereas lower GP values indicate 327 lower lipid order and higher fluidity , i . e . , L d > L o . 328 As controls for membranes with high vs . low lipid order , we used LUVs composed of 329 POPC , cholesterol , and sphingomyelin ( SM ) ( POPC : Chol : SM = 1 : 1 : 1 ) as well as LUVs 330 composed of POPC and SM ( POPC : SM = 1 : 1 ) ( Table 1 : PC : Chol : SM , PC : SM ) . SM is a 331 saturated lipid that is commonly found in biological lipid rafts ( 77 , 78 ) . Synthetic membrane 332 bilayers composed of POPC : Chol : SM = 1 : 1 : 1 form L o phases ( 74 ) and are used to model lipid 333 rafts . By contrast , synthetic membrane bilayers composed of POPC : SM = 1 : 1 form L d at 334 temperatures above ~ 40°C ( the phase transition temperature of SM ) and a combination of solid - 335 ordered ( S o ) and L d phases at temperatures below ~ 40 °C ( 79 ) . 336 In all compositions tested , 1 % POPC was substituted with Laurdan . Initially , Laurdan 337 emission spectra were recorded at 37 °C ( Fig . 5A ) and GP values were calculated ( Fig . 5B ) . As 338 expected , in POPC : Chol : SM LUVs , Laurdan had a strong 440 - nm emission peak and GP > 0 , 339 consistent with high amounts of L o phase ( Fig . 5A and B ) . Conversely , in POPC : SM LUVs , it 340 had a strong 490 - nm emission peak and GP < 0 , indicating predominantly the L d phase ( Fig . 5A 341 and B ) . To characterize the thermal stability of the ordered lipid phases , we recorded Laurdan 342 emission spectra in the 0 - 60 °C range and calculated the GP values ( Fig . 5C ) . POPC : Chol : SM 343 LUVs maintained high GP values at increasing temperatures , demonstrating the stability of L o 344 domains ( Fig . 5C , violet ) . By contrast , the POPC : SM LUVs underwent a phase transition above 345 38 °C caused by the “melting” of the S o domains , and the GP changes from positive to negative 346 ( Fig . 5C , dark blue ) . 347 Next , we tested LUVs used in the in - vitro fusion assays ( Table 1 : No Chol , 17 % Chol , 348 33 % Chol ( BMP ) , 50 % Chol , No POPE , No BMP ) . The GP values increased with the 349 increasing cholesterol amount ( Fig . 5B ) . The LUVs containing 33 % or 50 % cholesterol ( Table 350 1 : 33 % Chol ( BMP ) , 50 % Chol ) were relatively thermostable , indicating a higher order ( Fig . 351 5C , blue and black , respectively ) , whereas those with 0 % or 17 % cholesterol ( Table 1 : 0 % 352 Chol , 17 % Chol ) were not , indicating higher fluidity ( Fig . 5C , light grey and dark grey , 353 respectively ) . These results are consistent with the known lipid ordering effect of cholesterol 354 ( 80 - 83 ) . 355 13 Interestingly , the GP and thermostability of No BMP LUVs were higher than BMP LUVs 356 despite both having 33 % cholesterol and on par with 50 % Chol LUVs and POPC : Chol : SM 357 LUVs ( Fig . 5B and C ) . Conversely , the GP and thermostability of No POPE LUVs were lower 358 than BMP LUVs , despite both having 33 % cholesterol ( Fig . 5B and C ) . Thus , we hypothesize 359 that BMP and POPE have opposite effects on the ordered lipid phase , with BMP decreasing it 360 and POPE increasing it . 361 To relate fusion efficiency to lipid order , we compared HSV - 1 - mediated fusion levels ( Fig . 362 4 ) to the GP values across different lipid compositions ( Fig . 5 ) . Fusion was lowest without BMP 363 or in the presence of 50 % cholesterol ( Table 1 : No BMP , 50 % Chol ) ( Fig . 4 ) , which are lipid 364 compositions with the some of the highest GP values , > 0 . 2 , comparable to the POPC : Chol : SM , 365 indicative of a high amount of ordered lipid phase ( Fig . 5 ) . This suggests that high lipid order 366 prevents membrane fusion . On the opposite end of the order spectrum , No Chol LUVs had the 367 lowest GP value , ~ - 0 . 2 , which corresponds to predominantly L d phase ( Fig . 5 ) , and supported 368 intermediate levels of fusion ( Fig . 4 ) . However , efficient fusion was observed with 17 % Chol , 369 BMP , and No POPE LUVs , which are lipid compositions that had intermediate GP values , 370 between ~ - 0 . 1 and ~ 0 . 1 . The optimal fusion was observed with BMP LUVs ( Fig . 4 ) . Therefore , 371 we hypothesize that efficient HSV - 1 - mediated fusion in vitro requires an optimal balance of 372 ordered lipid phase and fluidity , achieved in the presence of 33 % cholesterol , BMP , and POPE . 373 374 Sphingomyelin reduces fusion . Biological membranes typically contain SM found in lipid rafts 375 ( 77 , 78 ) . To test the role of SM in HSV - 1 - mediated fusion , we added 8 % SM to BMP LUVs 376 ( Table 1 : BMP + SM ) . 8 % SM was chosen because an earlier subcellular fractionation study 377 reported that late endosomes , which contain BMP , also contain approximately 8 % SM ( 84 , 85 ) . 378 Surprisingly , in the presence of SM , fusion levels dropped almost to the fusion levels of 50 % 379 Chol LUVs , with < 20 % fluorescence ( Fig . 4 ) while the GP remained the same ( Fig . 5B and C ) . 380 We hypothesize that ordered lipid phases formed with vs . without SM are qualitatively different . 381 While ordered lipid phases formed in 33 % cholesterol , 16 . 7 % BMP , and 16 . 7 % POPE – our 382 optimal target LUV composition – support efficient HSV - 1 in - vitro fusion , the addition of SM 383 promotes the formation of the ordered lipid phase that is less conducive to fusion . 384 385 14 HSV - 1 entry glycoproteins gB , gH , gL , and gD are sufficient for in - vitro fusion . HSV - 1 has as 386 many as 16 envelope proteins , but only four – gB , gH , gL , and gD – are essential for viral entry 387 and cell - cell fusion ( 13 , 86 , 87 ) . To test whether these four glycoproteins were sufficient for in - 388 vitro fusion , we generated VSV virions lacking the native fusogen G and pseudotyped with 389 HSV - 1 gB , gH , gL , and gD ( VSV Δ G - BHLD ) . Previously , we showed that these VSV Δ G - BHLD 390 pseudotypes entered two types of HSV - 1 - susceptible cells ( 57 , 88 ) . Here , we found that the 391 VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes fused with the target BMP LUVs . As with HSV - 1 , the in - vitro 392 fusion of the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes required both the receptor ( HVEM200t - His 8 or 393 nectin345t - His 8 ) and low pH ( Fig . 6 ) . The fusion levels of VSV Δ G - BHLD in the absence of the 394 receptor were very low , ~ 10 % ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . 395 The VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes fused even more efficiently than HSV - 1 ( Fig . 2 ) . For 396 example , in the presence of HVEM200t - His 8 , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes achieved ~ 80 % 397 fusion at the optimal pH of 5 . 0 ( Fig . 6A and C ) compared to ~ 60 % for HSV - 1 ( Fig . 2B and E ) . 398 Moreover , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes fused more efficiently at a pH of 5 . 5 , with ~ 60 % 399 fusion ( Fig . 6AC ) compared to ~ 20 % for HSV - 1 ( Fig . 2B and E ) . Additionally , in the presence 400 of nectin345t - His 8 , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes fused more efficiently and at a higher pH , 401 achieving ~ 50 % dequenching at a pH of 5 . 0 ( Fig . 6B and D ) compared to ~ 15 % with HSV - 1 402 ( Fig . 2C and F ) . Higher errors in technical replicates ( Supplementary Fig . S4D and E ) could 403 be due to heterogeneity in the pseudotype production . Nonetheless , we conclude that on the 404 virion side , the essential HSV - 1 entry glycoproteins gB , gD , gH , and gL are sufficient for 405 efficient in - vitro fusion . 406 To confirm that HSV - 1 entry glycoproteins were required for in - vitro fusion just as for 407 HSV - 1 entry and cell - cell fusion , we generated the VSV Δ G - BD pseudotype , which lacks the 408 gH / gL complex . The fusion levels of the VSV Δ G - BD at pH 5 . 0 were ~ 25 % and ~ 20 % in the 409 presence of HVEM200t - His 8 or nectin345t - His 8 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . These 410 levels are much lower than those of VSV Δ G - BHLD under the same conditions , ~ 80 % and ~ 50 % 411 ( Fig . 6 ) , and comparable to the fusion levels of VSV Δ G - BHLD in the absence of the receptor , 412 ~ 10 % ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . 413 Fusion rates , k fast , were similar for HSV - 1 and the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype regardless 414 of the receptor , which ruled out the possibility that the differences in fusion extent between 415 15 HSV - 1 and the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype were due to the differences in fusion rates 416 ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . This is an expected finding because fusion in both cases utilizes the 417 same fusogen , gB , so the fusion mechanisms are expected to be similar . The differences in fusion 418 efficiency could , then , be dictated by the amount of gB , the fusogen , on the particle surface . To 419 test this , we directly compared the amount of gB on HSV - 1 and the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype 420 by Western Blot analysis . Indeed , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype has more gB , on average , 421 compared to HSV - 1 ( Supplementary Fig . S9 ) , which could explain its higher fusion efficiency . 422 423 In - vitro fusion of the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype requires a lipid with a negatively charged 424 headgroup , cholesterol , and POPE in the target membrane . To compare the lipid requirements 425 for the in - vitro fusion of VSV Δ G - BHLD relative to HSV - 1 , we omitted single lipids ( POPE , 426 BMP , and cholesterol ) from target LUVs by replacing them with the equivalent amounts of 427 POPC ( Table 1 , no POPE , no BMP , no Chol ) . As with HSV - 1 , optimal in - vitro fusion with 428 VSV Δ G - BHLD required both BMP and 33 % cholesterol ( Fig . 7 ) . However , unlike HSV - 1 , 429 VSV Δ G - BHLD fusion also required POPE because its omission reduced fusion ~ 4 - fold ( Fig . 7 ) . 430 Moreover , while 17 % Chol LUVs supported efficient fusion in the case of HSV - 1 ( Fig . 5 ) , in the 431 case of VSV Δ G - BHLD , fusion in the presence of 17 and 0 % cholesterol was equally low ( Fig . 7 ) 432 with a ~ 4 - fold reduction . Therefore , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype has more stringent 433 requirements for target membrane lipid composition than HSV - 1 . 434 435 DISCUSSION 436 In - vitro reconstitution of HSV - 1 - mediated membrane fusion identifies low pH as a fusion co - 437 trigger . HSV - 1 - mediated membrane fusion is a complex process , with multiple factors required 438 on both the viral and host sides . To better define the factors that are necessary and sufficient for 439 this process , we reconstituted membrane fusion in vitro with purified HSV - 1 virions and 440 synthetic target liposomes . As expected , efficient fusion required the presence of a host entry 441 receptor , HVEM or nectin - 1 . These receptors were added in the form of purified ectodomains in 442 solution and did not need to be tethered to the target membranes , which is consistent with their 443 primary roles as fusion triggers rather than target membrane attachment factors . Importantly , we 444 found that in addition to HVEM or nectin - 1 , in - vitro fusion also required low pH , with an 445 optimal pH of 5 . 0 , in contrast to cell - cell fusion , which occurs at neutral pH ( 28 , 29 ) . 446 16 Under in - vitro conditions , HVEM200t - His 8 supported more efficient fusion than 447 nectin345t - His 8 . Although HVEM and nectin - 1 have overlapping binding sites on gD , HVEM 448 binding requires the formation of an N - terminal hairpin in gD whereas nectin - 1 binds a pre - 449 existing site ( 89 ) . Therefore , it is plausible that HVEM triggers conformational changes in gD 450 more efficiently at low pH , at least , under in - vitro conditions . In contrast , nectin - 1 may require 451 additional cellular factors for efficient triggering . 452 Our findings are consistent with an earlier study where HSV - 1 was associated with 453 synthetic liposomes at low pH ( 5 . 0 - 5 . 3 ) in the presence of HVEM162t - His 6 ( equivalent to 454 HVEM200t - His 8 used in our study ) but not nectin346t - His 6 ( 90 ) . Just as in our study , the 455 receptors were not tethered to the liposomes . Authors proposed that the binding of soluble 456 HVEM162t - His 6 to gD on the surface of HSV - 1 at low pH triggered a cascade of conformational 457 changes that led to the exposure of gB fusion loops and their insertion into the liposomes ( 90 ) . 458 We hypothesize that fusion in our in - vitro system is triggered in much the same way . 459 HSV - 1 - mediated fusion is typically considered to be receptor - triggered rather than pH - 460 triggered because fusion always requires an entry receptor but can occur at neutral pH . For 461 example , HSV - 1 enters some cell types , including one of its physiological targets , neurons , by 462 fusion at the plasma membrane ( 19 - 21 ) . Robust fusion at neutral pH is also observed in 463 uninfected cells overexpressing the four essential HSV - 1 entry glycoproteins , gB , gH , gL , and 464 gD , so long as an entry receptor is present on target cells ( 28 , 29 ) . However , HSV - 1 entry into 465 many cell types , including the physiologically relevant epithelial cells and keratinocytes , occurs 466 by endocytosis and fusion with an endosomal membrane ( 22 - 27 , 30 ) and in some cell types , is 467 sensitive to inhibitors of endosomal acidification ( 30 ) . Given that low pH was required for fusion 468 in our simplified system , we hypothesize that low pH is a biologically relevant co - trigger for 469 HSV - 1 fusion . The requirement for low pH as a co - trigger would explain why HSV - 1 enters 470 certain cell types by pH - dependent endocytosis . But if low pH were a fusion co - trigger , then how 471 could fusion also occur at neutral pH ? We hypothesize that in the context of cell entry at the 472 plasma membrane or cell - cell fusion , the co - trigger role may be fulfilled by other , yet undefined , 473 cellular factors , including proteins or other surface molecules . 474 475 In - vitro HSV - 1 fusion requirement for BMP or POPS implicates endosomal entry . On the 476 target membrane side , efficient in - vitro fusion required a lipid with a negatively charged 477 17 headgroup , BMP or POPS . BMP is found only in late endosomes ( 84 , 85 ) and has been reported 478 as important for entry of Dengue virus ( 43 ) , VSV ( 46 , 91 ) , Lassa ( 92 ) , and Uukuniemi virus 479 ( 32 ) . Interestingly , optimal HSV - 1 fusion in vitro occurs at a pH of 5 . 0 , which is typical of late 480 endosomes . The requirement for the pH and the lipid found in late endosomes suggests that 481 during endocytic entry into some cells , HSV - 1 may fuse with the membrane of late endosomes . 482 Further studies are needed to clarify the precise location of the HSV - 1 fusion compartment 483 across different cell types . 484 POPS is found in early endosomes , the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane , and viral 485 envelopes . When present on viral envelopes , it aids cell entry [ reviewed in ( 93 ) ] . Interestingly , 486 HSV - 1 has been shown to activate phospholipid scramblases ( 94 ) that redistribute 487 phosphatidylserines to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane . Therefore , POPS could 488 potentially play a role during HSV - 1 entry by facilitating fusion at the plasma membrane or in 489 early endosomes . POPS can also interact with calcium ( 95 ) changing the physical properties of 490 membranes , and calcium can trigger the formation of fusion pores in artificial systems ( 96 ) . 491 Moreover , it is important for the fusion of viruses such as the Middle Eastern Respiratory 492 Syndrome virus ( 97 ) and the Ebola virus ( 39 ) . HSV - 1 has also been shown to promote entry by 493 triggering the release of intracellular calcium ( 98 ) . Therefore , it is possible that under certain 494 conditions , calcium could function as a co - trigger for HSV - 1 fusion . 495 The third lipid with a negatively charged headgroup , POPA , did not support efficient 496 fusion . Unlike BMP and POPS , POPA has not yet been implicated in the entry of any virus . 497 POPA is also short - lived and is likely a messenger and metabolic precursor of other 498 phospholipids reviewed in ( 99 - 101 ) . 499 500 Efficient HSV - 1 fusion in vitro requires a balance of lipid order and fluidity . Efficient HSV - 1 501 fusion in vitro required cholesterol , with 33 % being the optimal concentration . Cholesterol 502 modifies many of the physical properties of membranes , including fluidity , elasticity , thickness , 503 and domain formation ( 71 , 73 , 77 , 82 , 102 - 109 ) , reviewed in ( 75 ) , in a concentration - dependent 504 manner ( 71 - 74 ) . Many enveloped viruses require cholesterol either in the host cell membrane or 505 the viral envelope for entry ( 40 , 41 , 63 - 70 ) . Indeed , cholesterol and other sterols , such as 506 desmosterol , are required for efficient HSV - 1 infection ( 57 , 66 , 68 ) , for yet unclear reasons . In 507 the case of HIV entry , cholesterol has been proposed to induce the formation of ordered lipid 508 18 domains , specifically requiring the L o / L d interface ( 41 ) and can further regulate fusion by 509 reducing membrane lateral mobility ( 63 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that HSV - 1 - mediated 510 fusion in vitro depended on lipid order in target membranes . 511 To test this , we assessed the degree of lipid order in lipid compositions used in fusion and 512 correlated lipid order with fusion efficiency . We found that in vitro , HSV - 1 - mediated fusion 513 levels depended on cholesterol concentration and lipid order . In the presence of 50 % cholesterol , 514 which corresponds to the high amount of ordered lipid phase , fusion levels were lowest . This 515 suggested that high lipid order precludes HSV - 1 fusion . In the absence of cholesterol , where 516 lipids were predominantly disordered , we observed intermediate fusion levels . Efficient fusion 517 was achieved in the presence of 17 % or 33 % cholesterol , which had intermediate lipid order , the 518 latter composition being optimal for fusion . In addition to cholesterol , BMP and POPE also 519 influenced lipid order and the opposite effects on the ordered lipid phase , with BMP decreasing it 520 and POPE increasing it . Therefore , we conclude that efficient HSV - 1 - mediated fusion in vitro 521 requires ordered lipid phases in target membranes and that optimal balance of lipid order and 522 fluidity is achieved in the presence of 33 % cholesterol , BMP , and POPE . 523 Interestingly , we found that the addition of SM to this optimal lipid composition reduced 524 fusion levels to very low while not affecting the degree of lipid order . Therefore , ordered lipid 525 phases formed in the presence of SM are qualitatively different from those formed in its absence 526 and less conducive to fusion . In biological membranes , SM is typically found in ordered lipid 527 domains , or lipid rafts ( 77 , 78 ) . If lipid rafts form under our experimental conditions , they appear 528 to be , somehow , incompatible with efficient HSV - 1 fusion . The optimal lipid composition for in - 529 vitro HSV - 1 fusion may contain very small lipid rafts . Alternatively , it may lack ordered lipid 530 domains but , instead , have higher viscosity ( 83 ) . Future studies will elucidate the nature of the 531 ordered lipid phase formed in target LUVs and its role in HSV - 1 fusion . 532 533 The VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes fuse even more efficiently than HSV - 1 in vitro . By 534 reconstituting fusion with the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes instead of the native HSV - 1 virions , 535 we showed that on the virus side , the four entry glycoproteins , gB , gH , gL , and gD , were 536 sufficient for fusion . Surprisingly , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes supported higher levels of 537 fusion in vitro than HSV - 1 . Fusion rates , k fast , were similar for HSV - 1 and the VSV Δ G - BHLD 538 19 pseudotype regardless of the receptor , which suggested that the differences in fusion extent were 539 due to the differences in fusion efficiency rather than fusion rates ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . 540 The reasons for this are not yet clear . However , the distinct membrane curvature of the 541 bullet - shaped VSV pseudotypes could promote better fusion . Alternatively , the pseudotypes 542 could have a more optimal distribution of glycoproteins on their surface . To improve the yields 543 of the pseudotypes , we transfected 4 times more plasmid encoding gB relative to the other three 544 plasmids . As a result , the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes could contain a higher density of gB , 545 which could potentially promote higher levels of fusion . Indeed , we found that the VSV Δ G - 546 BHLD pseudotype had , on average , more gB compared to HSV - 1 ( Supplementary Fig . S9 ) , 547 which could explain its higher fusion efficiency . Finally , since our pseudotypes lack any HSV - 1 548 tegument proteins , we might not be recapitulating tegument - glycoprotein interactions ( 55 , 110 ) . 549 There may be outside - in ( or vice versa ) signaling between the tegument proteins and membrane 550 proteins ( 55 , 111 ) that could regulate HSV - 1 fusion . 551 Both the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes and HSV - 1 required cholesterol and BMP for 552 efficient fusion . However , the pseudotype was more sensitive to cholesterol depletion and , unlike 553 HSV - 1 , required POPE . POPE is known to promote the formation of the hemifusion stalk 554 intermediate due to its negative curvature [ reviewed in ( 101 ) ] . If the VSV Δ G - BHLD fusion 555 depended on the formation of the hemifusion stalk as a rate - limiting step , it could be sensitive to 556 the availability of POPE . While cholesterol is also thought to promote hemifusion by inducing 557 negative curvature ( 101 ) , it can affect membrane dynamics and fusogen activity in other ways , 558 including but not limited to lipid ordering discussed above [ reviewed in ( 75 ) ] , so its 559 contributions to fusion are not limited to changing membrane curvature . 560 A more efficient fusion of the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotypes in vitro raises the question of 561 why these pseudotypes have a narrow tropism . In our previous work , we showed that the 562 VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype efficiently entered only two of the seven HSV - 1 susceptible cell 563 lines ( 57 ) . Cell entry efficiency did not correlate with the type of the receptor ( nectin - 1 versus 564 HVEM ) , their cell surface amounts , or with the route of entry ( endosomal versus plasma 565 membrane ) . The gB : gH : gL : gD ratios were also similar between the pseudotypes and HSV - 1 566 ( 57 ) . Earlier , we concluded that one or more of the 12 so - called non - essential HSV - 1 envelope 567 proteins , missing from the pseudotypes , could contribute to the broad tropism of HSV - 1 . Our 568 work does not offer a clear explanation for the limited tropism of the pseudotypes . However , we 569 20 hypothesize that it is not due to a defect in fusion but rather a defect at an earlier step in entry , 570 e . g . , endocytosis or the inability to engage a cellular factor necessary for entry at the plasma 571 membrane . 572 By reconstituting HSV - 1 fusion in vitro here , we have not only established the 4 573 glycoproteins and the receptor are sufficient for fusion in a minimal , bare - bones system , but have 574 also provided evidence that low pH serves as a co - trigger of HSV - 1 - mediated fusion . The in - 575 vitro fusion system established here can be used for a systematic exploration of the mechanism 576 of HSV - 1 - mediated fusion . 577 578 MATERIALS AND METHODS 579 Cells . HEK293T ( gift from John Coffin , Tufts University ) and Vero ( ATCC CCL - 81 ) cells were 580 grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM , Lonza ) containing high glucose and 581 sodium pyruvate and supplemented with L - glutamine , 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum 582 ( FBS ) , and 1x penicillin - streptomycin ( pen - strep ) solution . C10 cells ( a gift from Gary Cohen , 583 University of Pennsylvania ) , a clonal B78H1 derivative stably expressing human nectin - 1 , were 584 grown in DMEM containing high glucose , sodium pyruvate , and L - glutamine and supplemented 585 with 5 % FBS and pen - strep solution and maintained under selection for nectin - 1 expression with 586 250 mg / mL of G418 . All mammalian cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 unless 587 otherwise noted . Sf9 cells were grown in suspension in serum - free Sf - 900 II media ( Gibco ) 588 containing 1x pen - strep in spinner flasks at 27 °C with aeration . For larger flasks , additional 589 aeration was provided by an air pump through a 2 - port airflow assembly . 590 591 Plasmids . pPEP98 , pPEP99 , pPEP100 , and pPEP101 , which encode full - length gB , gD , gH , and 592 gL from HSV - 1 ( strain KOS ) , respectively , were a gift from Patricia Spear ( Northwestern 593 University ) . pCMV - VSV - G encoding the full - length VSV G was a gift from Judith White 594 ( University of Virginia ) . 595 596 LUV preparation and labeling . LUVs were prepared by mixing lipids in chloroform at indicated 597 experimental compositions ( Table 1 ) using the following lipids : 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - 598 glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine 599 ( POPS ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( POPE ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - 600 21 sn - glycero - 3 - phosphate ( POPA ) , bis ( monoacylglycero ) phosphate ( BMP ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - 601 glycero - 3 - [ ( N - ( 5 - amino - 1 - carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl ] ( nickel salt ) DGS - 602 NTA ( Ni ) , Sphingomyelin ( SM ) , or cholesterol ( Chol ) . After being mixed , the lipids were dried 603 under a gentle argon stream and allowed to further dry under a vacuum overnight with minimal 604 exposure to light . The lipids were then hydrated using HBS - Citrate - SRB buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 605 50 mM sodium citrate , 150 mM NaCl pH 7 . 5 , 25 mM Sulforhodamine B ) when used for fusion 606 or HBS - Citrate buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 50 mM sodium citrate , 150 mM NaCl pH 7 . 5 ) when 607 used for Laurdan fluorescence spectroscopy . The lipids were warmed to 37 °C and vortexed 608 several times before being first frozen in liquid nitrogen and then thawed in a water bath at 37 609 °C . The lipid suspension went through 5 freeze / thaw cycles before being extruded through a 100 - 610 nm filter 21 times . To remove excess SRB , LUVs using a Sephadex G - 25 column equilibrated 611 with HBS - Citrate buffer . 612 613 LUV Quantification . Prior to bulk fusion experiments , all LUV preparations were quantified and 614 measured using multi - angle light scattering ( MALS ) . MALS analysis ( Dawn Heleos II , Wyatt 615 Astra 7 . 3 ) included measuring the radius of gyration ( r g ) and concentration of LUVs , which was 616 then compared to theoretical concentrations calculated as described in ( 112 ) . An additional 617 detector for dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) was used to report the hydrodynamic radius ( r h ) of 618 LUVs to quantify size distribution . LUV extrusions were measured in batch mode using a 619 microcuvette with a sample volume of 20 μL . Dilutions of LUVs were prepared , and 620 appropriately diluted to keep the sample within the dynamic range of the instrument . Light 621 scattering ( LS ) detection limits were previously determined and validated using NIST standard 622 polystyrene beads of 100 - nm and 200 - nm diameter . Representative measurements include the 623 LUV concentration ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) , distribution ( r h ) ( Supplementary Figure 624 S1B ) , and radius size ( r g ) ( Supplementary Figure S1C ) . 625 Potential dequenching ( dilution of SRB ) is dependent on the relative increase in volume 626 after fusion . As such , LUV volume is sensitive to changes in radius size during the extrusion 627 process , which can influence dequenching potential . Therefore , consistent results are dependent 628 on consistent radii . The radii were calculated using the Lorenz - Mie coated sphere model and the 629 following parameters : shell thickness of 5 nm ( representing typical bilayer thickness ) and 630 refractive indices of 1 . 46 and 1 . 33 for the shell ( lipid bilayer ) and the sphere ( water ) , 631 22 respectively . R g , r h , and model fit were all used to determine the quality of lipid extrusions . The 632 LUVs extruded through a 100 - nm filter had r g values of 50 - 60 ± 1 - 3 nm . Inconsistent bulk fusion 633 traces could be traced back to LUV preparations where the measured radii had error values ±10 - 634 25 nm and wider r h distribution , in addition to deviation from the Lorenz - Mie coated sphere 635 model , indicative of insufficient extrusion and the presence of multilamellar vesicles . 636 637 Laurdan Fluorescence Spectroscopy . LUVs were prepared in the same manner as LUVs used 638 for fusion except that the LUVs contained 1 % Laurdan , were rehydrated in HBS - Citrate without 639 SRB , and did not require desalting . Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba 640 Quantamaster 8000 equipped with a Peltier heated cuvette holder with stirring capability . The 641 holder had constant stirring at 700 rpm and variable temperature . Fluorescence excitation and 642 emission wavelengths were 350 nm and 400 - 600 nm , with a slit width of 5 nm for excitation and 643 1 nm for emission . Approximately 1 . 5 mg / mL of LUVs were used to obtain emissions scans . The 644 temperature was ramped up automatically , and once the cuvette reached the target temperature , 645 the emission scan was repeated . Raw fluorescence values were used to calculate GP values using 646 the equation GP = ( I 440nm - I 480 ( 494 ) nm ) / ( I 440nm + I 480 ( 494 ) nm ) - 1 . 647 648 HSV - 1 propagation and purification . HSV - 1 strain GS3217 ( an F strain derivative encoding an 649 NLS - tdTomato transgene expressed from an IE promoter , a gift from Greg Smith , Northwestern 650 University ) was propagated and titrated on Vero cells ( ATCC ) . To produce large viral stocks , 651 approximately 2x10 9 adherent Vero cells ( 10 T175 flasks , 2x10 7 cells / flask ) were infected with 652 HSV - 1 at MOI 0 . 01 by replacing cell media with virus diluted in minimal media Opti - MEM 653 ( ThermoFisher ) . The virus was allowed to adhere to cells at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 for 1 hour with 654 minimal agitation every 15 minutes . After 1 hour , the virus - containing media was removed and 655 replaced with 10 % FBS DMEM . Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 , and the supernatant 656 was collected 48 - 72 hours later . 657 To ensure batch - to - batch consistency , HSV - 1 virions were purified by density gradient 658 centrifugation using a 10 - 50 % iodixanol gradient to separate them from the L - particles , 659 according to published protocols ( 113 , 114 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1D ) . Briefly , virus - 660 containing media was clarified of cell debris by centrifugation at 1 , 500 g for 15 minutes , twice . 661 The virus was then pelleted in an SW27 rotor at 28 , 000 g for 90 min . The supernatant media was 662 23 removed and replaced with a minimal volume of HNE buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 663 pH 7 . 4 ) to resuspend the viral pellets to a combined volume of approximately 1 mL . The viral 664 pellets were first agitated and then incubated in HNE buffer overnight at 4 °C . Iodixanol step 665 gradients from 10 - 50 % in 10 % increments were prepared and allowed to equilibrate to form a 666 continuous gradient overnight at 4 °C . The viral pellets were resuspended HNE buffer by 667 pipetting gently and pooled together . The pooled virus was then loaded onto the step gradients 668 and density purified using an SW41 rotor at 160 , 000 g for 4 hours , with a “no brake” stopping 669 setting . The resulting viral band was collected using a side - puncture technique , aliquoted , and 670 stored at - 80 °C . Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells as described in ( 113 , 671 114 ) . 672 The purified HSV - 1 virions were then analyzed using MALS and DLS in batch mode 673 using a Wyatt Dawn Heleos II in batch as described in the LUV quantification section with some 674 modifications . The radii were calculated using the Lorenz Mie homogenous sphere light 675 scattering model and Rayleigh - Gans Sphere model using a refractive index value of 1 . 41 ( 115 ) 676 and were on average ~ 98 nm ( representative data shown in Supplementary Figure S1G ) . 677 Although both models had their caveats , e . g . , Rayleigh - Gans is more accurate when the 678 refractive index of the sample is close to the environment and Lorenz - Mie assumes the particle is 679 homogenous , the experimentally determined radii agreed with the literature values of 92 - 115 nm 680 ( 54 , 55 ) . Concentration values were between 1x10 10 and 1x10 11 particles per mL , on average 681 ( representative data shown in Supplementary Figure S1E ) . Using the titers and the particle 682 counts , we calculated the particle - per - PFU ratios . Most HSV - 1 preparations had a particle - to - 683 PFU ratio of 20 - 30 , on average ( representative data shown in Supplementary Figure S1H ) . 684 These values are close to the initially reported value of 10 ( 116 ) and the more recently reported 685 values of 20 - 23 ( 56 ) , which are used as gold standards of HSV - 1 virion quality . Only virion 686 preparations with a particle - to - PFU ratio of 20 - 30 were used in our experiments because values 687 of > 30 produced inconsistent results . A representative size distribution as measured by DLS 688 ( Supplementary Figure S1F ) shows a typical preparation . Wider distributions were often seen 689 with preparations with particle - to - PFU ratios of > 30 and were used for initial quality assessment . 690 691 VSV Δ G - BHLD and VSV Δ G - BD Pseudotype Generation and Purification . The VSVΔG - BHLD 692 pseudotype was prepared as described in ( 88 ) with minor modifications . Briefly , HEK293T cells 693 24 ( 1 . 7 x 10 7 cells / T175 flask ) were transfected with 7 . 5 μg each of pPEP99 , pPEP100 , pPEP101 , 694 and 30 μg of pPEP98 with polyethyleneimine ( PEI : 1mg / mL ) at a 3 : 1 ratio . To generate the 695 VSVΔG - BD pseudotype , pPEP100 and pPEP101 were replaced with the pCAGGS vector . Ten 696 T175 flasks were used for producing enough purified virus for bulk fusion . After 24 hours post - 697 transfection at 37 °C , cells were infected with the VSVΔG - G “helper” pseudotype at an MOI of 698 3 at 30 °C . 48 hours post - infection , the supernatant was collected , and the virus was purified by 699 density centrifugation . The initial purification step was to clear cell debris by centrifuging the 700 sample through a 12 % iodixanol cushion at 1 , 500 g for 15 minutes . The virus was then pelleted 701 using an SW27 rotor at 28 , 000 g for 90 min . The supernatant was removed and replaced with a 702 minimal volume of HNE buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) to resuspend the viral 703 pellets in a combined volume of approximately 1 mL . The viral pellets were agitated and then 704 incubated in HNE buffer overnight at 4 °C , undisturbed . Iodixanol step gradients from 15 - 35 % 705 in 5 % increments were prepared and allowed to equilibrate to a continuous gradient overnight at 706 4 °C . The viral pellets were resuspended in HNE buffer by gentle pipetting and pooled together . 707 The pooled virus was then loaded onto the continuous gradients and density purified using an 708 SW41 rotor at 160 , 000 g for 90 min , with a “no brake” stopping setting . The resulting viral band 709 was collected using a side - puncture technique , aliquoted , and stored at - 80 °C . 710 Viral titers ( Infectious Units or IU ) on C10 cells were calculated from the number of 711 GFP - positive cells per inoculum volume . The purified virus was also characterized and counted 712 using MALS and DLS using a Wyatt Dawn Heleos II in batch mode as described in the LUV 713 quantification section . However , due to the shape of the virus interpretation using software 714 ( Astra 7 . 3 ) had to be modified . The bullet shape could be approximated to a rod and the best 715 approximation to obtain particle number and length ( as opposed to radius ) requires a user - 716 defined cylinder radius and refractive index ( Rayleight - Gans : Rod ) . We used a radius of 35 nm 717 that we determined from negative stain electron microscopy of purified BHLD particles . As there 718 are no reported refractive index values for VSV or any other Rhabdoviridae , we used a value of 719 1 . 55 , which approximates an extracellular vesicle containing 1 / 3 each protein ( 1 . 584 ) 1 / 3 lipid 720 ( 1 . 460 ) and 1 / 3 nucleic acid ( 1 . 620 ) . 721 722 Expression and Purification of HVEM and Nectin - 1 ectodomains . Genes encoding His - tagged 723 ectodomain versions of the HSV - 1 gD receptors HVEM ( HVEM200t ) or nectin - 1 ( nectin345t ) 724 25 were synthesized by GenScript ( GenBank accession numbers AF060231 and U70321 , 725 respectively ) . Native signal peptide sequences were replaced with those of honeybee melittin and 726 terminated with 8 histidines . The resulting constructs HVEM200t - His 8 and nectin345t - His 8 are 727 nearly identical to ones previously characterized in the literature ( 90 , 117 , 118 ) . HVEM200t - His 8 728 used here is identical to HVEM162t - His 6 reported elsewhere ( 118 ) but uses a different 729 numbering convention ( residue 1 corresponds to the first methionine rather than the first residue 730 of the mature protein , after the cleavage of the signal sequence ) . The sequences were subcloned 731 into the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac1 ( Invitrogen ) . The recombinant , soluble His - 732 tagged versions of the receptors were produced in Sf9 cells infected with recombinant 733 baculoviruses as described below . 734 Recombinant bacmids and recombinant baculovirus stocks were produced by GenScript . 735 The high - titer P2 was used to make P3 baculovirus for a large - scale expression . 4 L of Sf9 cells 736 grown in suspension were infected with P3 baculovirus at a ratio of 1 : 250 . At 48 hours post - 737 infection , the cell suspension was centrifuged at 4 , 500 g for 30 min at 4 °C and the pellet was 738 discarded . The cell supernatant was then filtered through a 0 . 22 - μm pore size filter . The filtered 739 supernatant was then loaded onto a 5 - mL HisTrap Excel column ( Cytiva ) at a rate of 5 mL / min . 740 The column was then washed with 10 column volumes each of the following concentrations of 741 imidazole : 0 mM , 10 mM , 25 mM , and 50 mM in 150 mM PBS , pH 7 . 4 buffer . Protein was 742 eluted with 250 mM imidazole in 150 mM PBS , pH 7 . 4 buffer . The eluate was further purified 743 using size - exclusion chromatography ( Superose 6 column , Cytiva ) to remove aggregates and 744 remaining contaminants . Peak fractions were pooled , concentrated to 5 mg / mL , and stored at - 80 745 °C . Representative Coomassie - stained gels of purified proteins are shown in Supplementary 746 Figures S3A and B . 747 748 In - vitro Bulk Fusion Assay with HSV - 1 and the VSV Δ G - BHLD pseudotype . Approximately 2 - 749 5x10 7 PFU ( ~ 0 . 4 - 1x10 9 particles ) of HSV - 1 or ~ 0 . 4 - 1x10 9 particles of the VSV Δ G - BHLD 750 pseudotype were mixed with 0 . 4 - 1 μM LUVs ( 0 . 5 - 1x10 9 particles ) with or without 0 . 8 μM 751 HVEM200t - His 8 or nectin345t - His 8 in HBS - Citrate buffer in a quartz cuvette to a total volume 752 of 2 mL . Fluorescence was recorded using a Horiba Quantamaster 8000 equipped with a Peltier 753 heated cuvette holder with stirring capability . The holder was kept at 37 °C with constant stirring 754 at 700 rpm . Fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 565 nm and 586 nm 755 26 with a slit width of 5 nm . The sample was incubated in the cuvette at 37 °C with stirring for 10 756 min before data collection . Fluorescence was then recorded for 1 min to obtain baseline 757 fluorescence . At 1 min , pH was reduced using predetermined amounts of 1 M HCl , or the soluble 758 receptor was added . After 5 min , post pH shift or receptor addition , the sample was fully de - 759 quenched by the addition of 10 % Triton X - 100 to a final concentration of 0 . 1 % . Fully de - 760 quenched fluorescence was recorded for 30 s and used for normalizing the fluorescence data . 761 Data were normalized using the equation F normalized = F t - F i / ( F max - F i ) - 1 , where F i is the initial , 762 baseline fluorescence , F t is the fluorescence at time t , and F max is fluorescence after the addition 763 of Triton X - 100 . Normalized values of the technical replicates were then averaged . Fluorescence 764 at 5 min post triggering , pH shift , or receptor addition , were considered endpoint values for 765 comparison . Where applicable , the normalized data were also fit using the following two - phase 766 ( exponential ) association analysis built into GraphPad PRISM9 , Y = Y 0 + SpanFast x ( 1 - e ( - 767 KFast ( t ) ) + SpanSlow x ( 1 - e ( - KSlow ( t ) ) ) , where SpanFast = ( Plateau - Y 0 ) x PercentFast x 0 . 01 and 768 SpanSlow = ( Plateau - Y 0 ) x ( 100 - PercentFast ) x 0 . 01 . 769 770 HSV - 1 Inactivation Assay . Approximately 5x10 5 PFUs of HSV - 1 in 1mL of HBS - Citrate buffer 771 were incubated at 37 °C or 4 °C with or without 1 μM HVEM200t - His 8 for 1 hour . pH was then 772 shifted to the indicated pH using predetermined amounts of 1 M HCl and incubated at 37 °C ( or 773 held at 4 °C for the pH 5 . 0 / 4 °C condition ) . After 1 hour , the sample was back titrated to pH 7 . 4 774 using 1 M NaOH . For neutral pH conditions , the buffer was used instead of HCl or NaOH . The 775 sample was then kept at 4 °C before being diluted in Optimem and immediately used for 776 infection . Approximately 50 PFUs were used to infect 1 . 5x10 5 Vero cells per well , in duplicate , 777 in a 6 - well plate . The inoculum was replaced with 10 % FBS DMEM containing 1 . 25 % 778 carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC ) after 1 hour . Plaques were grown for 48 - 72 hours , at which point 779 media was removed and cells were stained using 1 % crystal violet dissolved in 50 % methanol . 780 Cells were destained using deionized water , and plaques were counted , with counts averaged 781 between the two wells . Plaques were normalized to the control condition of no receptor at pH 782 7 . 4 . 783 784 Western Blotting . Purified , concentrated HSV - 1 or VSVDG - BHLD virions ( 3 x 10 7 particles ) 785 were mixed with SDS - PAGE loading dye and boiled for 15 min . Samples were loaded onto 4 - 786 27 15 % precast polyacrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad ) , separated by SDS - PAGE , and transferred onto a 787 nitrocellulose membrane . The membrane was blocked with TBS buffer containing 0 . 05 % Tween 788 ( TBST ) and 5 % milk for 1 hour at room temperature . The membrane was incubated with the 789 polyclonal rabbit anti - HSV - 1 - gB antibody R68 at a 1 : 5000 dilution in TBST at 4 °C overnight . 790 The membrane was washed and incubated with goat anti - rabbit LI - COR IR800 secondary 791 antibody at a 1 : 5000 dilution in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature . After washing , the 792 membrane was imaged using a LI - COR Odyssey imager . R68 pAb was a gift from G . H . Cohen 793 and R . J . Eisenberg ( U . Pennsylvania ) . 794 795 Statistics . Statistical analysis was done for each experiment using one - way ANOVA with 796 multiple - comparison Tukey adjustment as implemented in GraphPad PRISM 9 . 797 798 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 799 We thank Gary Cohen ( University of Pennsylvania ) for the gift of C10 cells ; Patricia Spear , 800 ( Northwestern University ) for the gift of HSV - 1 glycoprotein plasmids ; John Coffin ( Tufts 801 University ) for the gift of HEK293T cells ; Gregory Smith ( Northwestern University ) for the gift 802 of HSV - 1 GS3217 strain ; and Michael Whitt ( University of Tennessee ) and Judith White 803 ( University of Virginia ) for the gift of the VSVΔG - GFP pseudotyping platform .

Estimates of lipid order of the synthetic membranes used in this study . ( A ) 873 Laurdan fluorescence emission reports on lipid order composition . LUVs were prepared as for 874 fusion experiments ( Table 1 ) except that 1 % POPC was substituted with Laurdan . Fluorescence 875 emission was recorded and normalized from 400 - 600 nm . The emission peak at 440 nm reports 876 the presence of an ordered lipid phase whereas the emission peak between 480 and 494 nm 877 indicates a predominantly disordered lipid phase . PC : SM and PC : Chol : SM compositions served 878 30 as controls for highly ordered and highly disordered phases , respectively . ( B ) Peak fluorescence 879 values at 440 nm and 480 or 494 nm were used to calculate generalized polarization ( GP ) 880 defined as I 440nm - I 494nm / I 440nm + I 494nm , which reports on the extent of membrane order , with GP 881 values increasing with increasing lipid order . ( C ) Fluorescence emission was recorded as a 882 function of temperature , and GP values were calculated as in ( B ) . For each condition , a single 883 replicate was obtained . 884 885 Figure 6 .
