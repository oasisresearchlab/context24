Box 9555 , 2300 Rl3 Leiden , The Netherlands Combined analysis of co - citation relations and words is explored to study time - dependent ( “dynamical” ) as - pects of scientific activities , as expressed in research publications . This approach , using words originating from publications citing documents in co - citation clus - ters , offers an additional and complementary possibility to identify and link specialty literature through time , compared to the exclusive use of citations . Analysis of co - citation relations is used to locate and link groups of publications that share a consensus concerning intel - lectual base literature . Analysis of word - profile similar - ity is used to identify and link publication groups that belong to the same subject - matter research specialty . Different types of “content - words” are analyzed , includ - ing indexing terms , classification codes , and words from title and abstract of publications . The developed methods and techniques are illustrated using data of a specialty in atomic and molecular physics . For this spe - cialty , it is shown that , over a period of 10 years , con - tinuity in intellectual base was at a lower level than continuity in topics of current research . This finding in - dicates that a series of interesting new contributions are made in course of time , without vast alteration in general topics of research . However , within this frame - work , a more detailed analysis based on timeplots of individual cited key - articles and of content - words re - veals a change from more rapid succession of new em - pirical studies to more retrospective , and theoretically oriented studies in later years . Introduction Combined analysis of co - citation relations and word - profile similarities is explored to improve the capability of quantitative techniques to depict structural and dy - namical aspects of scientific research . In our foregoing This study is part of a project financed by the Ministry of Educa - tion and Sciences , through the Netherlands Advisory Council for Science Policy ( RAWB ) . Received February 24 , 1989 ; revised October 4 , 1989 ; accepted October 10 , 1989 . 0 1991 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc . publication ( “Mapping I , ” Braam et al . , this issue ) we emphasize the structural aspects ( “local stability” ) of “science mapping , ” while in this article we focus on the analysis of dynamical aspects ( “temporal stability” ) of scientific research . Starting with a clustering of documents that often co - occur in the reference lists of publications ( co - citation clustering ) , publications in the dataset are grouped on the base of ( one or more ) citations to these clustered documents . This “classification” of publi - cations is believed to partition the dataset according to participation of publications in research special - ties ( Small & Griffith , 1974 ; Griffith et al . , 1974 ; Small , 1977 ; Small & Crane , 1979 ) . The prevalent idea that the “current research” publications of specialties are identified in this way , is based on theories of Price ( 1965 ) and Kuhn ( 1970 ) . In particular the way re - searchers draw on earlier work , and their sharing of a set of “exemplars” ( or “paradigm” ) , is considered to be reflected in the referencing practices of specialty mem - bers . In this article , the concept of a scientific “spe - cialty” will be used in the sense of “focused attention to a set of related research problems , and concepts by a number of scientific researchers , ” irrespective of the intellectual and social background of the researchers involved . These scientific researchers constitute the for - mal communication of the specialty , i . e . , publications in journals , proceedings , or books . Such “specialties” are , of course , only covered by co - citation analysis if a shared intellectual focus on earlier literature exists to - gether with shared interest in a set of related research problems and concepts . Such congruence is presup - posed in most co - citation studies , but is problemised in our research project . In order to describe the research topics involved in groups of “current - research’ publications ( as classified by co - citation clustering ) , word - profiles are con - structed . Word - profiles are lists of content - words re - lated to publications , such as indexing terms and classification codes added to these publications by pro - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE . 42 ( 4 ) : 252 - 266 , 1991 CCC 0002 - 8231 / 91 / 040252 - 15 $ 04 . 00 fessional indexing services , or words in title or ab - stract . Aggregation of word - profiles from publications citing ( one or more ) documents in a co - citation cluster , results in “group word - profiles” for the current research of specialties . These word - profiles can then be used to evaluate the degree of cognitive coherence within and similarity between these sets of “current research” pub - lications ( “Mapping I , ” Braam et al . , 1990 ) . Analysis of word - profile similarities between co - citation based publication groups , makes it possible to identify and link ( co - citation based ) specialty literature not only within a given period , but also through time . Groups of “current research” publications identified by co - citation clusters of one given year , that are strongly related by word - profile similarity , can be seen as repre - senting parts of the same , larger specialty . Between these groups , consensus concerning intellectual base lit - erature is apparently not shared , or is relatively low . Publication groups identified by co - citation clusters from different years that have high word - profile simi - larity , can be considered - approximately - as different phases of the same specialty . If the clusters by which these publication groups are identified also share a high percentage of cited documents , this indicates stability in focus on earlier literature , i . e . , stability in the intel - lectual base of a specialty . If stability in the intellectual base of a specialty is low , analysis of word - profile simi - larity is more useful than co - citation analysis in order to track down specialty literature through time . As there are no a priori reasons to assume stability in the intellectual base of specialties , nor to assume that dif - ferent specialties cannot have highly identical intellec - tual bases , exclusive use of citations to track specialty literature through time is prone to errors . It should be noted here , that the word - profiles based on indexing terms represent an ( “external” ) indexer - viewpoint as to what research topics are involved in publications , whereas title and abstract words represent an ( “internal” ) author - viewpoint . In the present case , we evaluate the usefulness of word analysis in addition to prior grouping of publica - tions based on co - citation analysis . It is , however , also possible to use an analysis of words in an independent fashion to group publications . In a related article we present results of a co - word clustering and com - pare these results to those of a co - citation cluster - based grouping of the same set of publications ( Braam et al . , 1989 ) . In this study , co - citation cluster - based publication groups of 10 successive years are analyzed for a spe - cialty in atomic and molecular physics ( viz . Rydberg Atoms and Molecules ) , in relation to their degree of cognitive resemblance ( for the operationalization of this concept we again refer to our foregoing article Mapping I ) , using profiles of content - words represent - ing an internal viewpoint , as well as profiles repre - senting an external viewpoint . Further , time - plots of individual cited documents and content - words related to clusters are constructed and compared in order to study dynamic aspects in some more detail . It will be shown that such additional word analysis provides an interesting possibility to improve interpre - tation of dynamic aspects of research in specialty litera - ture delimited by co - citation analysis . Data , Methods , and Techniques Data Publication data ( including indexing terms , profes - sional field - classification codes , titles , and abstracts ) , have been retrieved from INSPEC for 295 source publi - cations from the period 1974 - 1986 , based on a field expert’s document file . References of these source pub - lications have been retrieved from ISI / SCI ( coverage of these publications by IS1 was 93 % ) . Data on these publi - cations from both sources were then combined using dedicated software ( Moed , 1988 ) . The resulting data - base contains 273 source publications , with a total of 4225 different cited references of which 585 ( 13 . 8 % ) ref - erences were cited more than once , and 177 ( 4 . 2 % ) ref - erences were cited more than twice in one or more years . The numbers of different content “words” ( either controlled terms , uncontrolled terms , classification codes , or title and abstract words ) involved in these source publications is shown below together with the percentage of these terms , codes and words that are “unique” ( i . e . , occur exclusively in one publication ) ( Table I ) . Connectives , prepositions , pronouns , articles , and some verbs ( “to be , ” and “to have” ) from the title and abstract of publications , were excluded because these words do not relate to the content of the publica - tions involved . The annual number of publications in the expert’s document file was compared to an estimated * number of publications from this specialty , as contained in the INSPEC file . As shown in Figure 1 , the expert’s docu - ment file contains a subset of all publications in INSPEC identified as relevant to the “Rydberg” spe - cialty . The discrepancy between the two lines in TABLE I . Content Words All Unique controlled indexing terms uncontrolled indexing terms classification codes title words abstract words 248 43 % 2123 84 % 163 36 % 836 58 % 3423 52 % * This was done by using a set of controlled and uncontrolled terms , based on analysis of such terms in the expert’s document file , to select documents in the INSPEC file , and inspection of the relevance of retrieved documents by the expert .

Comparison of the number of Rydberg publications in an expert’s document file and in the INSPEC online database . Figure 1 reflects individual scope and interest of the expert as well as the expert’s entrance and departure of the specialty . Our dataset , thus , represents the specialty as seen and appreciated by a single expert and not the “entire” specialty , though the selection is of course still a cognitively coherent collection of documents . Methods and Techniques of Data Processing A detailed account of co - citation analysis as devel - oped and performed by ISI , can be found in the review articles of Small and colleagues on this subject ( Small & Sweeney , 1985 ; Small et al . , 1985 ) . A description of our approach to the problem of choosing appropriate threshold levels , and of our approach to the description of research topics related to co - citation clusters was presented earlier ( Braam et al . 1988 ) . A fuller account of our method of combined co - citation and word analy - sis is given in our foregoing publication ( “Mapping I , ” Braam et al . 1990 ) . As described in detail in Mapping I , analysis of word profile similarities between co - citation cluster based publication groups is used to evaluate variance between research topics involved in these publication groups . The possibility this method offers to track clusters through time , is in fact an addition to the method used by Small ( 1977 ) , where clusters are followed through time by examining the number of key - articles ( i . e . , clus - tered highly cited documents ) shared by co - citation clusters of successive years . These two methods , one using words related to publications citing co - citation clusters and the other using clustered cited documents , are complementary . It will be clear , that our approach rests on the follow - ing two assumptions . First , that continuity in the use of specific content - words as subject - descriptors of citing publications of successive years , does indeed reflect sta - bility in research topics in the current work of a spe - cialty , as judged by indexers and authors respectively . Secondly , the assumption that persistence of key - articles in clusters of successive years indeed does re - flect stability in the intellectual base of a specialty , as indicated by authors . If these assumptions hold , continuity in research top - ics involved in the current work of a specialty , in as far as represented by the citing publications of co - citations clusters , can be established by determining the similar - ity of word - profiles , using the cosine formula ( Jones & Furnas , 1987 ) : i W ( A ) * W ( B ) Sim ( A , B ) = , n i4 n ( 1 ) where , W ( A ) = weight of term i for cluster A , in the boolean case W ( A ) = 0 ( absence ) or 1 ( presence ) ; W ( Bj ) = weight of term i for cluster B , in the boolean case W ( Bj ) = 0 ( absence ) or 1 ( presence ) ; IZ = total number of terms for cluster A and cluster B together . In order to study dynamics of research topics in more detail - in addition to examination of similarity val - ues - a plot of the temporal development of individual words is made , i . e . , we display which words emerge , persist , or disappear in the course of time . The number of key - articles shared by clusters of suc - cessive periods ( for example years ) , is determined , and expressed as an index value . For this purpose a “stabil - ity index” ( Small , 1977 ) can be used . For clusters of suc - cessive years , the use of such index is essentially equivalent to the use of the Jaccard Index ( Sneath & Sokal , 1973 ) , which gives the cardinal number of the intersection of different clusters divided by the cardinal number of their union . In this study we used this latter index in order to determine continuity in intellectual base . In order to study changes in the intellectual base in some more detail , a plot of the development of individ - ual clustered key - articles is constructed . Results and Discussion Co - Citation Clustering Co - citation clusters have been formed for the years 1976 - 1985 , using a citation threshold of two citations per year ( i . e . , three citations or more are required for any year ) , and a co - citation strength threshold ( using the cosine formula ) equal to the median of this strength 254 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - - May 1991 for each separate year . * The resulting time series of clusters is shown in Figure 2 , together with links be - tween clusters from different years based on shared key - articles ( i . e . , links indicating continuity in the intel - lectual base of research in this specialty ) . The clusters include for each year 80 - 100 % of all yearly cited docu - ments that reach the citation threshold . The number of publications citing documents included in the various clusters ranges between 11 and 27 per year . Assuming all source publications in the ( expert - based ) dataset to be relevant to the “Rydberg” specialty , the recall value of co - citation analysis varies in this case between 35 % and 76 % per year ( 58 % over all years ) . Thus , if the above assumption is correct , co - citation clustering re - sults are incomplete . * The median co - citation strength values are in the range 0 . 30 - 0 . 50 for the years 1976 - 1985 . This measure of central tendency was chosen for the sake of comparability of results for the different years . As the strength values were not normally distributed in all years , the median was preferred above the mean as a comparable measure of central tendency . Although the expert’s document file can be regarded as a cognitive unit , in most years more than one cluster is formed . Whether this split - up relates only to differ - ences in intellectual base , or also to differences in re - search topics studied , will be discussed below . Further , not all clusters have links to older and / or younger clus - ters , while some clusters have lots of links . Most links concern the larger ( size in terms of the number of clus - tered key - articles ) clusters . In general , there seems to be a main line of continuity including the larger clus - ters for each year , accompanied by short sidelines with smaller clusters from only a few years in the past . Description of Research Topics Related to Clusters Research topics involved in the current work related to these co - citation clusters have been described using indexing terms ( controlled and uncontrolled terms from INSPEC ) , and words from title and abstract of publi - cations citing these co - citation clusters .

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - May 1991 257 terms ( terms occurring only once ) in order to exclude isolated aspects of research , and using only so called “central” publications for each cluster ( i . e . , publications that cite exclusively to one single cluster ) . Thus we are able to maximize differences between clusters . As for indexing terms , the frequency of uncontrolled terms is much lower than the frequency of controlled terms for most of the “Rydberg” clusters ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . This probably reflects “text - specificity” of uncontrolled terms ( 84 % of these terms are “unique” ) , as contrasted by the more unified character of controlled terms ( 43 % “unique” terms ) that are selected by the indexer from a subject thesaurus . Both these types of indexing terms are mostly phrases of two or more words , and are often mutually exclusive . For instance , the frequently used controlled term “atomic excited states” does not occur in the uncontrolled terms ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . This applies to a large extent also to the individual constituent words of indexing terms . For instance , from the controlled term “atomic excited states” the words “atomic” and “ex - cited” are not present in the uncontrolled vocabulary ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . In contrast , single words from title or ab - stract are not mutually exclusive . For instance , the word “Rydberg” occurs frequently in both title and abstract ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . It is interesting to note that this word , which , according to the opinion of an expert , indicates the central concept of the specialty , is frequently used in title and abstract of citing publications , does also fre - quently occur in the uncontrolled terms but is not present in the controlled vocabulary . This word , al - though very useful as an “internal” indicator of work in the “Rydberg” specialty over almost the entire lo - year period under consideration , apparently has little value as an “external” subject indicator according to the Physics Abstracts indexing service . A typical aspect of abstract words is the occurrence of rather general words indicating the empirical nature of the research involved , e . g . , “found , ” “observed , ” “measured , ” “discussed , ” “account , ” and “calculations” ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . S UC words are of course not very specific , h but as a scientific specialty may not be empirically ori - ented , and as publications in specialties that are empiri - cally oriented may still deal with conceptual problems , these words still are informative for other researchers as content descriptors . Word - Profile Similarity Relations between Clusters of the Same Year The degree of word - profile similarity between clus - ters concerning indexing terms is given in Table 2 . Word - profile similarity values concerning title and ab - stract words taken together are given in Table 3 . As in this particular case - study all publications in the data - set are assumed to be related to one and the same “Rydberg” specialty , it may be asked why , for a number of years , still more than one co - citation cluster per year is formed . This yearly split - up may be related to in - congruence in intellectual base only , or reflect also differences in topics of current research . Analysis of word - profile similarity concerning indexing terms indi - cates that different clusters of the years 1979 ( 1979 - 1 versus 1979 - 2 , and 1979 - 2 versus 1979 - 3 ) , 1980 , 1981 , and 1985 differ entirely in research topics , e . g . , the clusters 1980 - 1 , 1980 - 2 , and 1980 - 3 have zero similarity one with another , i . e . , no indexing term is shared by the word - profiles of these clusters ( Table 2 ) . However , if we inspect word - profile similarity concerning title and ab - stract words , all these clusters , except for the year 1985 , are related , though at a relatively low level of similar - ity * ( Table 3 ) . For instance , clusters 1979 - 1 , and 1979 - 2 have a ( title and abstract ) word - profile similarity to one another in the range 0 . 11 - 0 . 20 . The words relating these clusters are , among others , “Rydberg , ” “inter - action , ” “levels , ” “states , ” “electronic , ” “excitation , ” “ionization , ” and “quantum , ” all words indicating sig - nificant cognitive relations . Of the 1985 clusters , cluster 1985 - 3 is too small to have any word - profile at all , as it contains only one “central” publication . From the other two clusters , one ( 1985 - l ) deals with “atomic excited states” in relation to “collisions” and “interaction” of “atoms , ” and the other ( 1985 - 2 ) with “Rydberg” “states , ” “autoionisation , ” “photoionization , ” and “spectra of diatomic inorganic molecules” related to “HZ , ” and “hydrogen neutral molecules , ” ( see Figs . 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) ) . Thus , except for the year 1985 , in these cases authors and indexers apparently differ in opinion concerning the degree of content - relatedness of the cluster based publications groups , the authors indicating a weak link - age , whereas the indexers indicate isolation of these publication groups . Word - profile similarity between different clusters of the years 1977 , 1979 ( 1979 - 1 versus 1979 - 3 ) , and 1983 is in the range of 0 . 31 - 0 . 40 for indexing terms , and be - tween 0 . 11 and 0 . 40 for combined title and abstract words ( see Figs . 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) ) . Thus , for these clusters both types of content words ( indexing terms versus word from title and abstract ) indicate a cognitive relation be - tween the research topics involved in publications grouped by these clusters , though at a low to moderate similarity level ( 0 . 11 to 0 . 40 ) . Content words differenti - ating between these clusters ( see Figs . 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) ) are , among others , “atomic fluorescence , ” “depopula - tion , ” “quantum , ” and “structure” ( 1977 ) , “Rydberg levels , ” “Stark effect , ” “collisions , ” “states , ” and “absorption” ( 1979 ) , “atom - atom collisions” and “atomic * Low word - profile similarity between clusters may be the exclusive result of differences in length of their respective term lists , i . e . , the terms of one cluster are fully included in the larger list of another cluster . In such cases , low similarity indicates a difference in scope concerning the spectra of problems , concepts , and methods that are involved in the current research related to these clusters . 256 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - May 1991 TABLE 2 . Word - profile similarity based on indexing terms ( CT & UT ) between RYDBERG clusters for the years 1976 - 1985 . 1977 - 2 : Cluster nr . 2 from 1977 Only words with frequency higher than 1 per cluster were used . spectral line breadth’ in relation to “rubidium , ” versus “atomic beams” in relation to “Sodium” or “Na” ( 1983 ) . Thus , in these cases author - viewpoints and indexer - viewpoints are congruent , both indicating cognitive re - lation between different clusters of the same year at a low to moderate level . In general , we conclude from these results that the presence of more than one co - citation cluster in a num - ber of years relates not only to low “consensus on intel - lectual base literature , ” but also to a considerable extent to differences in research topics studied in cur - rent research publications . These differences in re - search topics concern various experimental and / or theoretical aspects , the study of different atoms , the use of different ( types ) of instruments , etc . Tracking “Rydberg” Publication Clusters through Time using Citations and Words Focusing on the larger clusters ( size in terms of the number of co - cited documents in clusters ) , continuity I with respect to its intellectual base seems to dominate the specialty ( as far as identified by the co - citation clustering ) for the period under consideration ( Fig . 2 ) . This is indicated by the numerous links based on shared key - articles between clusters of different age . Also , a number of “sidelines , ” and isolated groups are indicated by clusters linked to few if any clusters of other years , e . g . , clusters 1979 - 2 and 1980 - 3 indicate a “sideline , ” while clusters 1980 - 2 and 1981 - 3 ( though linked to each other ) , and clusters 1985 - 2 and 1985 - 3 indicate isolated groups of publications . Cluster 1979 - 3 is a particular case , as it is strongly related by cited documents shared with older clusters , but lacks any re - lation to more recent clusters ; all relations to more re - cent clusters are via cluster 1979 - 1 , the largest cluster for this year . Word - profile similarity relations based on indexing terms between clusters of different years indicate a high similarity in research topics between clusters of all years , not only between successive years , but also be - tween clusters in a specific year and clusters of all other JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - May 1991 259 TABLE 3 . Word - profile similarity , based on title ( TT ) and abstract ( AT ) words , between RYDBERG clusters for the years 1976 - 1985 . w 0 . 11 - 0 . 20 m 0 . 21 - 0 . 20 1977 - 2 : Cluster nr . 2 from 1977 Only words with frequency higher than 1 per cluster were used . years . However , not all clusters are involved , in fact , except for cluster 1979 - 3 , clusters that are almost com - pletely isolated with respect to clustered cited litera - ture , are also isolated with respect to indexing terms ( 1979 - 2 , 1980 - 2 , 1980 - 3 , 1981 - 3 , 1985 - 2 , 1985 - 3 ) . Cluster 1979 - 3 , has high similarity in indexing terms to clusters of all other years . Thus , the lack of relations to more recent clusters with respect to cited clustered docu - ments , indicates a shift in “intellectual base” in the spe - cialty ( as given by cited papers ) , but not in topics of research , at least according to the opinion of indexers . In general , more continuity seems present in re - search topics than in “intellectual base” ( cited papers ) if we look at indexing terms compared to cited literature involved in co - citation clusters ( see Fig . 2 and Table 2 ) . This clearly indicates that stability in topics of research , as judged by indexers , is not necessarily accompanied by an equal level of consensus on the importance or usefulness of earlier literature , as specified by authors . For instance , clusters 1976 - 1 , 1977 - 1 , and 1977 - 2 are re - lated by citations to clusters of at most three other years , while relations concerning word - profiles based on indexing terms are present with all other years . An even more striking case is cluster 1979 - 3 . This cluster is not related to any more recent cluster on the base of citations , with indexing terms however a relation is found to clusters of all more recent years ( Fig . 2 and Table 2 ) . Results of word - profile similarity based on words from title and abstract of publications citing clusters , show even more continuity in topics of research than indicated by the above results for indexing terms ( Table 3 ) . The similarity values however are , on aver - age , somewhat lower for title and abstract words than for indexing terms . Thus , authors indicate somewhat more , though weaker , linkages than indexers do . A most interesting finding is that clusters isolated with respect to both citations and indexing terms , still appear to be related to almost all other clusters by title and abstract words . This suggests that these clusters still 260 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - May 1991 are cognitively related to the rest of the “Rydberg” spe - cialty . Words linking these clusters to the other clusters are abstract words such as “Rydberg , ” “state , ” “excita - tion , ” “excited , ” and “state , ” as well as the title words “Rydberg , ” “state , ” and “absorption” ( Fig . 3 ( b ) clusters 1979 - 2 , 1980 - 2 , 1980 - 3 , 1981 - 1 , 1981 - 3 , and 1985 - 2 ) . The question arises , why these clusters are isolated with re - spect to indexing terms and clustered cited documents , while title and abstract words do indicate a relationship to the “Rydberg” specialty . Aspects of research topics differentiating these clusters from all other clusters ( see Fig . 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) ) are , among others , “caesium” ( 1979 - 2 ) ; “ab initio calculations , ” “potential energy curves , ” “molecular vibration , ” and “oxygen” ( 1980 - 2 ) ; “mi - crowave , ” and “millimeter” ( 1980 - 3 ) ; “distributions , ” “resonances , ” “cross , ” “sections , ” and “H2” ( 1981 - 1 ) ; “molecular rotation , ” “isotopic , ” and “spectroscopy” ( 1981 - 3 ) ; “double , ” and “spectra of diatomic inorganic molecules” ( cluster 1985 - 2 ) . Two logically possible ex - planations for this discrepancy are : ( 1 ) title and abstract words do indicate subject similarity more directly , and , therefore , more adequately than indexing terms or shared cited key - articles do ; or ( 2 ) these clusters indi - cate publications that are somewhat remote to the “Rydberg” specialty , as indicated by author citations and indexer opinion , but the authors try to establish a tighter link , in their titles and abstracts , maybe as it is a popular area of research . Assuming the cognitive co - herence of the originally selected “Rydberg” publica - tions in our dataset , the first option seems the most plausible . However , this discrepancy between citations and indexing terms , and title and abstract words as in - dicators of specialty membership is also related to dif - ferences in functioning of these “information carriers” in scientific research practices . Instead of trying to pick out the “best” indicator of specialty membership , it is perhaps more productive to try to gain some more in - sight in research practices by comparing the results of these different indicators . Details of Dynamic Aspects Not a single clustered cited document was cited over the whole lo - year period under consideration , while only a few cited documents occur in more than three successive years ( i . e . , GALLAGHER , TF , PHYSICAL REVIEW A , Volnr . 15 , p . 1945 , 1977 , and DUCAS , TW , PHYS REV LETT , Volnr . 35 , p . 366 , 1975 ) . No cited document occurs in more than six years ( Table 4 ) . Of the whole of clustered cited documents only 38 % ( 37 out of 97 documents ) occur in more than one year in a cluster . Newly introduced documents in clusters are generally young articles ( 46 % are one year or younger , and 86 % are three years or younger when appearing for the first time in a cluster , as far as concerns papers cited more than twice a year ) . From 1983 on , however , hardly any new articles are introduced . Thus there is a sudden change , in 1982 , in the “normal” process of re - placement of older by younger documents . In contrast , a typical combination of ( controlled and uncontrolled ) indexing terms has been found that char - acterizes the specialty over almost the entire period under consideration , namely “Rydberg levels , ” “Ryd - berg states , ” or “Rydberg atoms” together with “atomic excited states , ” “atom - atom collisions , ” and some names of substances ( Rb and Na ) used in experiments ( Table 5 ) . The relative number of terms that occur in more than one year is much higher for controlled terms ( 49 % ) than for uncontrolled terms ( 15 % ) . The few uncontrolled terms that do occur in more than one year , however , are very characteristic of the specialty : “Rydberg levels , ” “Rydberg states , ” and “Rydberg atoms” of “Na , ” “Rb , ” and “H2 . ” Controlled terms , though less characteristic , establish a framework that makes the uncontrolled terms more understandable : “atomic excited states , ” “atom - atom collisions , ” and “ionization of atoms , ” indicate how the term “Rydberg” fits into more understandable terms and established concepts in physics . Of all title words 36 % ( 28 out of 78 different terms ) occurs in more than one year in a cluster . Five words occur very frequently and give a good description of the general topic that relates the current work in the specialty of each year to the other current work of other years in the period 1976 - 1985 : “Rydberg , ” “excited , ” “states , ” “atoms , ” and “collisions” ( Table 6 ) . A signifi - cantly larger number of abstract words occur in more than one year as compared to title words , both relative ( 48 % ) and in absolute numbers ( 169 out of 351 ) . Also , the abstract words “Rydberg , ” “excited , ” “states , ” “atoms , ” and “collisions” occur very frequently in all or most of the years in the 1976 - 1985 period ( Table 7 ) . In addition , new words occur : “quantum , ” “cross , ” “sec - tions , ” and “n . ” Further , a number of specific abstract words indicating the mathematically based experimen - tal nature of the research in the specialty occur in many years : “experimental , ” “results , ” “observed , ” “measured , ” “calculations , ” “presented , ” and “dis - cussed . ” No new indexing terms appear from 1983 on , and the same holds for title words , as far as concerns words that occur in at least two publications ( “isolated words” excluded ) , while abstract words are not new from 1980 on . Thus , introduction of new aspects of re - search concentrates on the period before 1983 , and diminished somewhat already since 1980 . Classification codes show a change , from 1980 on , in emphasis in the research from more experimental in the earlier years to more theoretical in later years , a pattern probably typical for experimental research in physics ( Table 8 ) . In general , it seems a change occurred in the spe - cialty from rapid succession of new empirical studies to more retrospective and theoretical work in later years .

The fraction of these documents that occurs in at least two years is 38 % over all years together ( 37 out of 97 ) . Conclusions Co - citation analysis does not retrieve all publications contained in an expert’s document file related to the “Rydberg” specialty , a specialty in atomic and molecu - lar physics : a recall percentage of 58 % over all years in the period 1976 - 1985 has been achieved ( using a ci - tation frequency of two citations per year and a co - citation strength threshold value equal to median of the annual distributions of these strength values ) . In six of the 10 years under consideration more than one co - citation cluster was formed . Analysis of cita - tions and indexing terms suggest that several cluster - based publication groups represent isolated aspects of research in the specialty , i . e . , both intellectual base - literature and research topics seem to be different from the other publications of a particular year . Analysis of title and abstract words indicates , however , that these sets of publications are still cognitively related to the other publication groups of the specialty , but that their main emphasis is on topics that are somewhat periph - eral to the specialty . Analysis of linkages between clusters of different years points in the same direction . Many clusters of the “Rydberg” specialty are linked to clusters of other years by shared key - articles as well as by indexing terms and title and abstract words from publications citing these clusters ( word - profiles ) . However , clusters isolated by cited key - articles are also isolated by indexing terms , though title and abstract words indicate a , relatively low , cognitive linkage to clusters of other years . These differences between linkages based on index - ing terms on the one hand , and title and abstract words on the other , relate to differences in view between in - dexers and authors on what research topics are involved in publications . Differences , though , are not very large , and are hypothesized to result from ignoring weak link - ages by indexers , whereas authors may overemphasize 262 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - May 1991 TABLE 5 .

These results indicate that within the “Rydberg” spe - cialty intellectual base literature is not shared by all re - searchers , but that there are several different “schools . ” Further , a number of cluster - based publication groups apparently have no strong relation to the main topics of the “Rydberg” specialty , but have a peripheral position . These results do not simply reflect differences in specificity between cited references and indexing terms and keywords ( or title and abstract words ) , as indicators of “specialty membership , ” a suggestion made by one of our referees . This is because different processes are in - volved behind citation and indexing practices or the practice of titling and abstracting . The former being re - lated primarily to specification ( for various reasons ) of intellectual base , the latter directed primarily at specifi - cation ( for various reasons ) of research topics studied , as judged by indexers and authors . Indexers represent an information retrieval point of view , whereas authors represent an internal viewpoint . This difference in con - text has consequences for research topic description as authors probably want to gain a large audience , whereas indexers are more restrictive in order to optimize re - trieval precision . It is , therefore , at least theoretically , more productive to compare results of these different data , and on this base try to gain some more insight in these processes and their relation . The approach followed in this study , thus , enables an investigation of the continuity in the specialty , concern - ing its “intellectual base” in relation to its current re - search topics , as judged from different viewpoints . Continuity in “intellectual base” appeared to be at a lower level than continuity in topics of current re - search , the latter both to the opinion of authors as in - dexers . Continuity in topics of research was particularly reflected in title and abstract words , and thus by au - thors , but perhaps a little overemphasized .

Fraction of these words occurring in at least two years is 36 % ( 28 out of 78 ) . It is concluded that in several years different “schools” are present in the specialty , that a series of interesting new contributions are made in course of time that changed the base for further research , but that general topics of research did not change in the specialty . Further , by inspection of timeplots of individ - ual keyarticles and content - words , it was found that dynamics changed from rapid progression of new em - pirical studies in earlier years to more reflective and retrospective theoretical work in later years . The present study starts with a co - citation clustering , and superimposes a word analysis . This means that no independent comparison was made between a struc - turing based on citations and one based on words . Such comparison has been made in a follow up study , the results of which are presented elsewhere ( Braam et al . , 1989 ) . In general , the approach of combining co - citation and word analysis seems to provide a useful quantita - tive approach to study aspects of the dynamics of scien - tific research , as reflected in the formal literature at the level of research specialties . Compared to the exclusive use of citations , a more complete picture of dynamics of research can be established using such combined ap - proach , including information on intellectual base as well as on judgments about topics of research from an “internal” ( authors ) and an “external” ( indexers ) viewpoint . 264 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE - May 1991 TABLE 7 .
