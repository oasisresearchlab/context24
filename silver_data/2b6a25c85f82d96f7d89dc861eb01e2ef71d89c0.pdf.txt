InformationprocessingandtransmissionspeedintheBGisthoughttobelimitedbysynapticarchitectureoftwoserialinhibitory connections . Propagation speed may be critical in the avian BG circuit given the temporally precise control of musculature during vocalization . WeusedelectricalstimulationofthecorticalinputstotheBGtostudy , withfinetimeresolution , thefunctionalconnectivity within this network . We found that neurons in thalamic and cortical nuclei that are not directly connected with the stimulated area can respondtothestimulationwithextremelyshortlatencies . Throughpharmacologicalmanipulations , wetracethispropertybacktotheBG and show that the cortical stimulation triggers fast disinhibition of the thalamic neurons . Surprisingly , feedforward inhibition mediated by striatal inhibitory neurons onto BG output neurons sometimes precedes the monosynaptic excitatory drive from cortical afferents . The fast feedforward inhibition lengthens a single interspike interval in BG output neurons by just a few milliseconds . This short delay is sufficient to drive a strong , brief increase in firing probability in the target thalamic neurons , evoking short - latency responses . By blocking glutamate receptors in vivo , we show that thalamic responses do not appear to rely on excitatory drive , and we show in a theoretical model that they could be mediated by postinhibitory rebound properties . Such fast signaling through disinhibition and rebound may be a crucial specialization for learning of rapid and temporally precise motor acts such as vocal communication . Introduction The CNS provides several examples of circuits specialized for fast processing because they subserve tasks in which long transmis - sion delays have important behavioral costs . For instance , audi - tory information reaches the forebrain through a polysynaptic pathway within 10 ms ( Heil and Scheich , 1991 ; Sen et al . , 2001 ; Pollak et al . , 2003 ) . Similarly the vestibulo - ocular reflex can cause eye movements within 10 – 15 ms of head motion ( Broussard et al . , 1992 ) . Transmission speed is critical in neural systems in - volved in vocal communication in humans and birds because the duration of perceptually critical sounds in speech and bird songs can be as short as 10 ms ( Liberman et al . , 1961 ; Goller and Cooper , 2004 ; Glaze and Troyer , 2007 ) . The forebrain nuclei mediating song control form two segre - gated pathways ( see Fig . 1 A ) ( Nottebohm et al . , 1976 ) . The ro - bust nucleus of the arcopallium ( RA ) receives input from the cortical ( for discussion of nomenclature , see Materials and Meth - ods ) area HVC ( proper name ) both monosynaptically and polysynaptically , through a basal ganglia ( BG ) – thalamo - cortical circuit called the anterior forebrain pathway ( AFP ) ( Bottjer et al . , 1989 ) . This BG pathway is essential for vocal learning ( Bottjer et al . , 1984 ; Scharff and Nottebohm , 1991 ) . Song - related signals from HVC propagate through these two pathways ( Kimpo et al . , 2003 ) , which converge on individual RA neurons ( Mooney and Konishi , 1991 ) . For the signals themselves to interact in RA , propagation delays should match . Transmission delays within the BG , however , are expected to slow down signal propagation through the AFP . Indeed , activation of the thalamus through the BG first requires disin - hibition , the interruption of the tonic inhibition exerted on thalamic neurons by pallidal neurons ( Deniau and Chevalier , 1985 ) . In mammals , latencies of (cid:1) 20 ms have been reported between cortical activation and pallidal inhibition ( Nambu et al . , 2000 ) . Additional delays could be introduced depending on the mechanisms driving thalamic neurons during disinhi - bition . In songbirds , postinhibitory rebound in thalamic neu - rons allows them to respond to disinhibitory signals in the absence of excitation ( Luo and Perkel , 1999b ; Person and Per - kel , 2005 ) . Although faster than in mammals ( Thomson , 1988 ) , postinhibitory rebound might impose additional delays ( (cid:1) 10 ms ) between the cortical drive and the thalamic re - sponse . Based on time lags in correlated activity in the song system , Kimpo et al . ( 2003 ) have hypothesized transmission delays through the AFP of (cid:2) 60 ms .

DOI : 10 . 1523 / JNEUROSCI . 3060 - 09 . 2009 Copyright©2009SocietyforNeuroscience 0270 - 6474 / 09 / 2915420 - 14 $ 15 . 00 / 0 15420 • TheJournalofNeuroscience , December9 , 2009 • 29 ( 49 ) : 15420 – 15433 proposed a theoretical framework allowing learning despite long AFP delays . However , shorter delays would support a wider range of possible learning mechanisms . We used electrical stimulation to measure with high temporal precision the time course of information flow through the song - bird BG circuit . We report surprisingly fast transmission through the AFP , with latencies as short as 10 ms , relying on a BG disin - hibitory circuit specialized for speed . AFP signals may thus over - lap in time in RA with signals from the monosynaptic motor pathway , expanding the range of possible mechanisms underly - ing vocal learning . Materials and Methods Animals . Adult male zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ) were obtained from a commercial supplier and used in accordance with an animal use protocolapprovedbytheUniversityofWashingtonInstitutionalAnimalCareandUseCommittee . Animals were housed under a 14 / 10 h light / dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum . Surgery . Animals were first food deprived for 30 min and were then given three intramuscular injections totaling 5 – 6 . 5 ml / kg 20 % urethane over 1 h . Urethane anesthesia preserves normal neurotransmission in various subcortical areas and the peripheral nervous system ( Maggi and Meli , 1986 ) . Local anesthetic ( 1 % lidocaine ) was injected under the scalp before animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus . Small cranioto - mies were made above the midline reference point , the bifurcation of the midsagittal sinus , and above HVC and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum ( LMAN ) , the medial portion of the dorsolat - eral nucleus of the anterior thalamus ( DLM ) or Area X unilaterally . Lidocaine gel was then applied to the incision at 3 h intervals . Electrophysiological recording . Glass pipettes ( TW100F - 3 ; World Pre - cision Instruments ) were pulled on a micropipette puller ( model P97 ; Sutter Instruments ) , and the tips were blunted to achieve 5 – 25 M (cid:3) im - pedance . A ground electrode was placed in the cerebellum posterior to the midline reference point . A concentric stimulation electrode ( FHC ) was placed in HVC ( 0 mm rostral , 2 . 4 mm lateral from the midline reference point , 0 . 5 mm deep ) . The recording electrode signal was am - plified 10 (cid:4) and low - pass filtered at 3 kHz ( Axoclamp2B amplifier ; Mo - lecularDevices ) , passedthroughaHumBugnoiseeliminator ( AutoMate Scientific ) , and amplified further 100 (cid:4) ( model 410 ; Brownlee Preci - sion ) . Recordings were monitored using an oscilloscope and an audio monitor . We searched for single - unit neuronal activity in Area X , DLM , or LMAN using HVC stimulation as a search stimulus . Once a neuron was isolated , the electrophysiological signal was sampled at 20 kHz , and spike times and raw traces were stored for additional analysis ( Spike2 ; Cambridge Electronic Design ) . Principal components analysis of the spike shapes allowed clear separation from noise , and all extracted units obeyed a refractory period of 1 ms . In recordings in Area X , neurons displaying spontaneous firing above 25 spikes per second ( sp / s ) are re - ferred to as pallidal neurons given their similarity with pallidal terminals recordedinDLM ( PersonandPerkel , 2007 ) , whereasneuronsdisplaying a firing rate lower than 25 sp / s are called putative interneurons . Record - ingswereperformedduringHVCmicrostimulation ( monophasic0 . 2ms single pulses ) , with various stimulation intensities ( 10 – 4000 (cid:1) A ) . Each pulse of HVC microstimulation saturated the amplifier and occluded spikingactivityfor1 – 2msintherecordings , asaresultofthe“overshoot” after saturation . Because the duration of this stimulation artifact was much shorter than the latency of the fastest responses recorded , it oc - cluded only spontaneous activity and thus did not alter our analysis . Previous studies have shown that stimulation with a monopolar mi - croelectrodeat200 (cid:1) Aactivates (cid:2) 50 % oftheneuronslocatedinashellof 0 . 2 mm outside radius ( Ranck , 1975 ; Tehovnik et al . , 2006 ) . These values should be considered with caution because the current intensity neces - sary to activate an axon at a given distance depends on a number of other variables such as the size of the axon or its biophysical properties ( e . g . , cellularexcitabilityoraxonmyelination ) . Inaddition , concentricbipolar electrodes greatly reduce current spread , especially for higher stimula - tion intensities ( Bagshaw and Evans , 1976 ; Follett and Mann , 1986 ) , and estimates from monopolar electrodes thus provide an imprecise upper bound of the activated volume . The volume of the “activated shell” for 200 (cid:1) A ( inside and outside radius : 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 mm ) is 0 . 029 mm 3 and represents (cid:2) 10 % or less of HVC volume ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 mm 3 ) ( MacDougall - Shackletonetal . , 1998 ) . Therefore , 200 (cid:1) Apulsesappliednearthecenter of HVC through concentric bipolar electrodes are expected to activate (cid:5) 5 % of HVC neurons . We cannot exclude the possibility that some high - amplitude stimula - tionledtocurrentspreadtoneighboringstructures . However , becauseof the segregation of the AFP circuit from surrounding tissue , it seems unlikelythatoccasionalactivationofneighboringstructureswouldmod - ify the interpretation of the present data . Pairedrecordings . Pairsofunitswithdistinctwaveformswererecorded simultaneously at 14 DLM sites . These recordings always included a rap - idly firing unit with a monophasic spike waveform of smaller amplitude and a more slowly firing unit with a biphasic waveform of larger ampli - tude . The waveforms differed in amplitude by at least fourfold , permit - ting unambiguous classification of spikes . These recordings have been shown to reflect the activity of a presynaptic pallidal terminal and the corresponding postsynaptic thalamic cell ( Person and Perkel , 2007 ) . In all cases , the extracted units obeyed a refractory period of 1 ms . Because previous recordings of song - related and spontaneous activity gave simi - lar results , they were pooled in the analysis . Antidromic activation . We recorded high - frequency , spontaneously active neurons in Area X thought to be the pallidal projection neurons . We found no significant difference in the spike shapes of high versus low spontaneous activity neurons in Area X . The distributions of spontane - ous activity between these neurons and terminals within DLM were not significantly different ( see Fig . 4 A ) ( 73 Area X putative somata averaged 62 . 8 (cid:6) 17 . 3 sp / s ; 37 DLM terminals averaged 60 . 9 (cid:6) 13 . 6 sp / s ) . In some experiments , a parallel bipolar stimulating electrode ( 0 . 5 mm spacing ; FHC ) was placed in DLM for antidromic identification of projection neurons . Continuous analog records were acquired for at least 300 stim - uli , eachofwhichconsistedofsinglemonophasicpulsesdeliveredat0 . 1s intervals ( 0 . 1 ms duration , 0 . 2 – 2 mA intensity , stimulus isolation unit from ISO - flex ; A . M . P . I . ) . Latency variability was defined as the SD of latencies to the first evoked spike . Putative projection neurons were de - fined as having evoked spikes with small latency variability ( (cid:5) 0 . 2 ms ) and collision tests resulting in 100 % failure of the antidromic spike . Drug injections . All drugs were diluted in a 0 . 9 % saline solution with 0 . 5 % dextran - conjugated Alexa - fluor 488 ( 3000 molecular weight ; In - vitrogen ) . The role of GABA A receptor - mediated synaptic transmission in Area X was examined using microinjection of the GABA A receptor blocker gabazine ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 m M ; Tocris Bioscience ) . The role of glutama - tergic transmission in Area X and DLM was examined using microinjec - tionoftheAMPAreceptorblockerNBQX ( 1m M ; TocrisBioscience ) and the NMDA receptor blocker APV ( 5 m M ; Tocris Bioscience ) in 0 . 2 % DMSO . Vehicle solution consisted of either saline or 0 . 2 % DMSO solu - tion . Drugs were pressure ejected from pulled glass pipettes ( 10 – 20 (cid:1) m tip size ) using a Pressure system IIe ( 50 ms pulses at 10 – 16 psi ; Toohey ) . Injected volumes were 20 – 100 nl . When the recording and drug injec - tions were made in the same structure , we aimed to place the tip of the injection pipette 200 – 300 (cid:1) m from the tip of the recording pipette . Anatomy . At the end of each experiment , recording sites were labeled by iontophoretic injections of fluorescent dye [ 5 % Alexa - flour 488 - or 568 - conjugated 10 kDa dextran amine in 0 . 01 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) , pH 7 . 4 , ejected by 5 (cid:1) A alternating current for 5 min ] . Animals were killed by intramuscular injection of sodium pentobarbital ( Nembutal ) and perfused with 0 . 9 % saline , followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde as fixative . Thebrainwasthenremoved , postfixedin4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h , and cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose . Sections , 40 (cid:1) m thick , were then cut in the parasagittal plane on a freezing microtome and processed for histological examination to verify the location of stimulating and recording electrodes and drug injection sites . In addition to gross obser - vation of electrode tracts , the brain slices were visualized using a fluores - cence microscope allowing better determination of recording location . In the case of DLM recordings , descending axons from Area X were clearly retrogradely labeled in most cases , allowing unambiguous deter - mination of recording site . We were able to recover dye deposits in DLM Lebloisetal . • FastDisinhibitionthroughaBasalGangliaCircuit J .

ForquantificationofAreaXprojectionaxon size , bilateral iontophoretic injections of bio - tinylated dextran amine ( BDA ) ( 10 , 000 molec - ular weight ; 10 % in 0 . 1 M PB , pH 7 . 4 ; Invitrogen ) weremadeintoAreaX . Afterasur - vival time , birds were killed with pentobarbital as described above and then perfused transcar - dially , first with physiological saline followed by fixative containing 2 % paraformaldehyde ( TAAB , UK ) and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( TAAB ) in acetate buffer , pH 6 . 0 ( 5 min ) , and finally with fixative containing 2 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in borate buffer , pH 8 . 5 ( 50 min ) . Parasagittal sections ( 60 (cid:1) m ) containing DLM and Area X were cut with a vibratome . After pretreatment of sections , in - jection sites and labeled fibers were visualized with a nickel - intensified 3 , 3 (cid:7) - diaminobenzidine ( DABNi ) reactionresultinginbluish – blackre - action product [ sections were first incubated with avidin biotinylated – horseradish peroxi - dase complex ( ABC ) ( Vector Laboratories Burlingame , CA ) and then developed with DABNi ] . To examine the GABA content of the labeled axons , the tracer was visualized using a preembedding gold method followed by a postembedding anti - GABA reaction ( Bodor et al . , 2008 ) . Briefly , sections were first incubated with ABC followed by a signal amplification step using biotinylated tyramide reagent ( PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences ) , in - cubated in 1 nm gold - conjugated streptavidin ( Aurion ) , postfixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde , and then silver intensified with Aurion R - Gent in - tensification kit .

The ultra - small gold particles were silver intensified ( larger magnification of the area indicated by the black square shown in inset ) . This method reveals morphological details of the large axons , such as the structure of the fila - ments and myelin . Data analysis . Spike times were analyzed using Matlab 7 . 0 . 1 software ( MathWorks ) . Foreachcell , wecalculatedspontaneousfiringrate , inter - spike interval ( ISI ) distribution , and peristimulus time histogram ( PSTH ) of the response to HVC stimulation . Whereas the PSTHs dis - played in Figures 1 , 2 , 5 , and 7 have a 1 ms bin and are not smoothed , additional analyses were performed on PSTHs smoothed as follows . For eachtrial , thefiringratetimecoursewasdeterminedwith1msresolution byconvolvingthespiketrainwithaGaussiankernelofwidth1ms ( Baker and Gerstein , 2001 ) . The mean and SD of the spontaneous rate were determined over the 100 ms preceding stimuli . A neuron was considered to display a significant response if at least two consecutive bins of the PSTH were beyond limits defined by the spontaneous mean (cid:6) 2 . 5 SD . Responses were often made up of several components ( especially in Area X pallidal cells ) , some inhibitory and some excitatory . We defined the beginning of the response component as the time of the first of two consecutive bins of the PSTH in which the firing rate fell outside signif - icance limits ; similarly , the end occurred when two consecutive bins fell backwithinsignificancelimits . InDLMandLMAN , theresponselatency wasdefinedasthelatencytothefirstcomponentoftheresponse , whereas response duration was summed over all components . For pallidal neu - rons , we defined the latency to excitatory or inhibitory components as the latency to the first such component . The duration of excitatory or inhibitory components was the sum of the duration over all such com - ponents , respectively . Response strength was calculated over a response window as follows . First , the area of the PSTH above ( or below ) baseline firing rate was calculated as the sum of the differences between the PSTH bins above ( or below ) baseline firing and the mean baseline firing rate . These areas were then divided by the population average spontaneous firing rate multiplied by the length of the response window ( 35 ms in Area X , 60 ms in DLM ) . The result was called excitation ( or inhibition ) strength and expressed as a percentage of baseline firing . For DLM neu - rons , Area X putative interneurons and pallidal neurons displaying only excitatory responses , the lowest stimulation current intensity evoking a reliable response ( at least one additional spike in each trial ) , was selected for additional analysis . For pallidal neurons displaying some inhibition inresponsetostimulation , thelowestcurrentintensityevokinganinhib - itory component in their response was selected for additional analysis . For responses in DLM neurons , the probability of response was calcu - lated as the probability that a given trial contained at least one spike between 0 and 60 ms after HVC stimulation . The jitter in the response was defined as the SD of the time of the first spike in this window . For paired recordings in DLM , we computed the distribution of time lags between each thalamic spike and the immediately preceding pallidal spike .

We built a single compartment conductance - based model of a DLM neuron using the NEURON simulation package ( Hines , 1998 ) . The parameters were based on the thalamic relay neu - ron models of McCormick and Huguenard ( 1992 ) and Destexhe et al . ( 1996 ) . Channel conductances were tuned by hand such that model responses to current injection resembled those recorded ( Luo and Perkel , 1999b ) . Soma diameter was 15 (cid:1) m . Parameters for voltage - dependent Na and K currents were unchanged from the model of Destexhe et al . ( 1996 ) , except that “vtraub” was (cid:9) 45 mV . Maximal conductance density was 3 mS / cm 2 for Na and 5 mS / cm 2 for K . Parameters for low - threshold Ca and H currents followed Destexhe et al . ( 1996 ) , except that Ca dynamics were excluded and H current voltage dependence and kinetics were adjusted to match data of Luo and Perkel ( 2002 ) . Maximal conductance for Ca was 4 mS / cm 2 and for H current was 0 . 1 mS / cm 2 . Intrinsic properties were then fixed , and a single inhibitory synaptic input was added .

G was set to give a peak con - ductanceof12 . 8nS ( LuoandPerkel , 2002 ) . No short - term synaptic plasticity was included . Note concerning nomenclature . According to the revised nomenclature of the avian brain ( Reiner et al . , 2004b ; Jarvis et al . , 2005 ) , nuclei HVC and LMAN lie in the avian pallium , the structure overlying the BG . Mammalian cortex is also a pallial structure , along with the amyg - dala and claustrum . Although there remains some controversy regarding the precise evolu - tionary relationship between mammalian cor - tex and these avian pallial structures , we refer here to HVC and LMAN as “cortical . ” In addi - tion , we refer to the spontaneously active out - put neurons of Area X as “pallidal cells” because they share many features with mam - malian pallidal neurons ( Farries et al . , 2002 ) . It is important to note that they also differ in some respects from mammalian pallidal neu - rons ( Carrillo and Doupe , 2004 ; Gale et al . , 2009 ) . Such simplified nomenclature is in - tended to make this article more accessible to researchers interested in BG physiology but unfamiliar with the avian anatomy . Results LMAN and DLM neurons respond with very short latency to HVC stimulation To measure propagation speed through the AFP , we made extracellular single - unit recordings from 26 neurons in LMAN and 50 neurons in DLM displaying a response to electrical stimulation of cortical nu - cleus HVC . In both nuclei , spontaneous activity was low ( 4 (cid:6) 6 sp / s in LMAN and 2 (cid:6) 3 sp / s in DLM ) and irregular when it was present at all . The coefficient of variation ( CV ) of ISIs was 1 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 5 in 26 of 26 LMAN neurons and 0 . 9 (cid:6) 0 . 4 in 36 of 50 DLM neurons . HVC stimulation evoked increases in firing in all LMAN neurons ( Fig . 1 B , C ) . The minimal stimulation current necessary to evoke responses in LMAN was 200 (cid:1) A . The latency of these responses was surprisingly short in most neurons ( Fig . 1 E ) , with a median latency of 16 ms . As a result , the population aver - age PSTH undergoes a sharp rise starting at 11 ms and peaks at 17 ms after HVC stimulation ( Fig . 1 D ) . Firing irregularity remained high during the responses , with a CV of firing of 1 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 5 in the 0 – 500 ms window after stimulation . Responses were usually reliable ; the response probability was 0 . 6 (cid:6) 0 . 3 ( range , 0 . 2 – 1 ) . The timing of these responses was both precise and brief , with a 9 (cid:6) 5 ms jitter in the time of the first evoked spike . The response duration , de - fined as the number of consecutive bins beyond significance in the PSTH ( see Materials and Methods ) , was 27 (cid:6) 16 ms . Al - though latency to LMAN responses informed us about the overall transmission delays in the AFP , we decided to investigate DLM responses to reveal the mechanisms allowing fast signal propaga - tion through the BG . HVC stimulation also evoked rapid increases in firing in all but one DLM neurons ( Fig . 2 B , C ) . The minimal stimulation necessary to evoke responses in DLM was 100 (cid:1) A . The median latency of these responses was 17 ms ( Fig . 2 D ) , and the popula - tion average PSTH rose at 10 ms and peaked at 18 ms after stim - ulation ( Fig . 2 E ) . The similarity in the median latency in LMAN and DLM is surprising at first glance . However , given the conver - gence of synaptic inputs from many DLM neurons to a single LMAN neuron , each LMAN neuron is expected to receive input from a pool of DLM neurons . In response to HVC stimulation , the DLM neurons displaying short latencies might drive fast re - Figure 4 .

Al - though DLM responses consisting of single spikes or doublets were stable and consistent over time , they were usually not elicited on each trial . The probability of response among the recorded neurons averaged 0 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 3 ( range , 0 . 04 – 1 ) ( Fig . 2 F ) , and the firing variability thus re - mained high in response to HVC stim - ulation ( ISI CV of 0 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 3 ) . However , the timing of these responses , when elic - ited , was both precise and brief , with a 10 (cid:6) 6 ms jitter in the time of the first evoked spike . The response duration , defined as the number of consecutive bins beyond significance in the PSTH ( see Materials and Methods ) , was only 10 (cid:6) 10 ms . In summary , despite low response probability , DLM neurons display fast and precise responses to HVC stimula - tion . The response latencies in LMAN and DLM are shorter than were anticipated given the number of synaptic connections between HVC and DLM and the disin - hibitory mechanism involved . Thalamic firing is dominated by the inhibitory pallidal input ThemaininputtoDLMisGABAergicandarisesfromtheBG ( Bottjer et al . , 1989 ; Luo and Perkel , 1999a ; Person et al . , 2008 ) . Each DLM neuron receives input from a single or , at most , two large , aspiny Area X neurons ( Okuhata and Saito , 1987 ; Luo and Perkel , 1999a ) . These neurons display high spontaneous firing rates and are termed pallidal neurons because of their resemblance to neurons in the mamma - lian pallidum ( Farries et al . , 2002 ; Reiner et al . , 2004a ) . The large one - to - one calyx - like terminals formed by Area X pallidal neurons around DLM somata strongly hy - perpolarize DLM neurons ( Luo and Perkel , 1999b ; PersonandPerkel , 2005 ) . Moreover , this configuration allows simultaneous re - cording of pairs of the presynaptic pallidal and postsynaptic thalamic units ( Person and Perkel , 2007 ) , and we recorded the ac - tivity in 14 such pairs . The spike times of thalamic neurons in these pairs were very strongly constrained by the firing pattern of their presynaptic pallidal terminals . Indeed , in11of14pairs , atleast90 % ofthethalamic spikes occurred (cid:1) 10 ms after the preceding pallidalspike ( Fig . 3 A ) . Asaresult , theprob - abilityoffiringofthalamicneuronswasverylow0 – 10 ms after a pallidal spike . Their fir - ing probability increased dramatically for longerdelaysafterthelastpallidalspike ( Fig . 3 B ) . This suggests that a thalamic neuron could fire only if the presynaptic pallidal ISI was long enough . Figure5 . Response of pallidal neurons to HVC electrical stimulation .

Neurosci . , December9 , 2009 • 29 ( 49 ) : 15420 – 15433 • 15425 Most pallidal neurons project to the thalamus and have very short conduction latency Because the activity of DLM cells is dominated by their inhibitory somatic input from a single pallidal neuron , we investigated how short - latency responses to HVC stimulation in DLM could be mediated by pallidal neurons . We first measured the time it takes action potentials to propagate between Area X and DLM . We recorded from pallidal neurons in Area X ( see Materials and Methods and Fig . 4 A for a comparison with terminals in DLM ) and antidromically stimulated in DLM ( Fig . 4 B ) . We found that 67 % ( 20 of 30 ) of the high - frequency spontaneously active neu - rons in Area X displayed antidromic activation in response to DLM stimulation , with a latency of 0 . 85 (cid:6) 0 . 24 ms ( latency vari - ability of 62 (cid:6) 30 (cid:1) s ) . In contrast , axons from HVC to Area X have conduction latency (cid:2) 5 ms ( Hahnloser et al . , 2006 ) over a similar distance as that from Area X to DLM . In summary , at least two - thirds of Area X pallidal neurons appear to send an axon to DLM . Moreover , theaxonsfromAreaXtoDLMconductrapidly . Pallidal projection neurons have unusually large axons Consistent with the short conduction delays observed between Area X and DLM , the diameter of these axons was very large ( Fig . 4 ) . Light microscopy of axons anterogradely labeled from Area X revealed diameters of 2 . 1 (cid:6) 0 . 7 (cid:1) m as the axons entered DLM . Within DLM , axon diameters became even larger . Light and elec - tron microscopy ( EM ) revealed diameters (cid:1) 2 . 5 (cid:1) m ( light , 3 . 0 (cid:6) 0 . 8 (cid:1) m , n (cid:8) 63 ; EM , 2 . 7 (cid:6) 0 . 6 (cid:1) m , n (cid:8) 9 ) . Inaddition , theselarge Area X axons remain myelinated in DLM ( Fig . 4 C , D ) . These large diameters contrast with other axons connecting song - system nu - clei . Retrogradely labeled axons from LMAN to Area X , from the same injections used to label axons projecting to DLM , had sig - nificantly smaller diameters of 0 . 68 (cid:6) 0 . 33 (cid:1) m ( p (cid:5) 0 . 001 , n (cid:8) 97 ) . Comparing the conduction velocity of Area X - to - DLM neurons with large axons to smaller gauge axons between LMAN or HVC and Area X ( LMAN , Fig . 4 E ; HVC , our unpublished observation ) suggests that the large diameter of these axons saves at least 3 ms , or 20 % of the transmission delay from HVC to LMAN . Pallidal neurons display fast inhibition in response to HVC stimulation TounderstandhowmuchtimeprocessingwithinAreaXcontrib - utes to propagation delays between HVC and DLM , we investi - gated the response of pallidal neurons in Area X to HVC electrical stimulation . As expected , pallidal neurons recorded at the soma in Area X or the terminal in DLM exhibited rapid spontaneous activity ( 62 . 4 (cid:6) 15 . 6 sp / s , n (cid:8) 110 ) , which , unlike DLM firing , was quite regular ( ISI CV of 0 . 38 (cid:6) 0 . 16 ) . In response to low intensity stimulation in HVC ( 40 – 100 (cid:1) A , 0 . 2 ms pulses ) , pallidal neurons displayed short - duration excita - tion , with a latency of 8 . 0 (cid:6) 2 . 3 ms and a duration of 8 . 6 (cid:6) 4 . 6 ms ( Fig . 5 A ) . Note that such low stimulation intensities usually did not evoke any response in DLM . When stimulation intensity was increased ( (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) A ) , excitation became stronger , and , in many neurons , an inhibitory effect of stimulation appeared ( Fig . 5 B – D ) . The minimal stimulation current evoking feedforward inhi - bition in Area X pallidal cells was 200 (cid:1) A . Surprisingly , inhibition was sometimes fast and often appeared before excitation ( in 48 . 8 % of the neurons displaying inhibition ) ( Fig . 5 D ) . Short - duration excitation is likely mediated by monosynaptic connec - tions from HVC , whereas inhibition is likely disynaptic , and observing the inhibitory response before excitation was thus un - expected . Such responses were recorded in pallidal neurons re - corded in either Area X ( somata ) or DLM ( terminals ) . Because responses were very similar in both groups ( Fig . 6 , Table 1 ) , we pooled the data for additional analysis . As a result of combined excitatory and inhibitory effects , the first excitatory component of the pallidal neuron response had broadly distributed latencies 0 10 20 30 40 0 5 10 15 20 50 0 50 100 0 50 100 150 200 Time ( ms ) 0 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 30 40 Latency ( ms ) D u r a t i on ( m s ) Excitatory components Inhibitory components F i r i ng r a t e s p i k e s / s DLM terminals Area X somata 50 60 D u r a t i on ( m s ) DLM terminals Area X somata A B C Area X DLM LMAN Figure6 .

Interestingly , relatively high stimulation intensities ( (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) A ) are necessary to evoke inhibitory components in the re - sponses of pallidal neurons and to induce responses in down - stream nuclei . Such intensities might be necessary to activate simultaneously a physiologically relevant number of neurons in HVC . Indeed , we estimated that a stimulation current of 200 (cid:1) A ( sufficient to evoke an inhibitory component in many pallidal neurons ) applied in the center of HVC is activating at most 5 % of all HVC neurons ( see Materials and Methods ) . Because neurons projecting to RA or X and interneurons are distributed homoge - neously over the nucleus ( Wild et al . , 2005 ) , we expect such stim - ulation to activate 5 % of HVC neurons projecting to Area X ( HVC X ) . During singing , almost all ( 80 % ) HVC X neurons fire one to four bursts of 6 ms average duration during each song motif ( Kozhevnikov and Fee , 2007 ) , corresponding to an average activation period of 10 – 20 ms , or 2 – 4 % of the duration of the motif ( (cid:2) 500 ms ) . If all HVC X neurons were firing independently , 2 – 4 % of them would thus be simultaneously activated at any given time point in the song . As is apparent in the study by Kozhevnikov and Fee ( 2007 , their Fig . 2 A ) , singing - related activ - ity bursts seem often to happen simultaneously in 2 – 3 out of the 24 HVC X neurons recorded in that bird . The ratio of simulta - neously activated HVC X neurons might thus be higher than our estimate ( closer to 10 % ) , at least at certain times during singing . The strong synchronized drive sent from HVC to the BG after electrical stimulation with high current ( (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) A ) thus seems to involve a similar number of HVC neurons as singing - related activation . We then examined the distribution of the first few ( two to three ) ISIs evoked by HVC stimulation in pallidal neurons dis - playing an inhibitory component in their response . Their distri - bution extended over a range similar to that of ISIs evoked by song playback in those neurons ( Person and Perkel , 2007 ) , con - firming that HVC electrical stimulation evoked behaviorally rel - evant activation patterns in these neurons . Because of an increased number of shorter ISIs after stimulation , the median ISI duration was shorter in response to HVC stimulation than at baseline ( 13 (cid:6) 6 vs 17 (cid:6) 5 ms ) . However , longer ISIs ( (cid:1) 30 ms ) were also more likely to occur after the stimulation than during episodes of spontaneous activity ( 11 . 8 (cid:6) 14 . 0 vs 7 . 3 (cid:6) 11 . 8 % , p (cid:8) 0 . 03 ) ( Fig . 5 E , F ) . Because longer pallidal ISIs are associated with higher firing probability in DLM neurons , this response pattern in pallidal neurons might evoke increased firing in DLM . Although the exact relationship between the responses to HVC stimulation evoked in a pallidal cell and its target thalamic neuron could not be investigated here , some relationships can be inferred . On one hand , fast responses in DLM neurons , which have latencies shorter than the average pallidal ISI , might only involve the lengthening of a single pallidal ISI and therefore most likely rely on early inhibitory responses in pallidal neurons . On the other hand , slower responses in DLM neurons could be asso - Figure7 . ResponsesofputativeAreaXinterneurontoHVCelectricalstimulation .

As sug - gested by Person and Perkel ( 2007 ) , fast deceleration associated with an excitation – inhibition response profile could activate tha - lamic neurons and may thus underlie at least some of the slower responses in DLM neurons . Finally , late excitatory components of pallidal responses might be involved in the truncation of DLM responses , which could serve to maintain or improve timing precision . Together , our results indicate that Area X pallidal neurons often display a fast inhibition in response to HVC stimulation , and this short inhibitory response would be expected to disin - hibit a target DLM neuron and increase its firing probability . Putative Area X interneurons exhibit short - latency responses to HVC stimulation The spontaneously active pallidal neurons constitute only a minority of Area X neurons . The vast majority of neurons within Area X are striatal spiny neurons , which are homolo - gous to mammalian medium spiny neurons ( Farries et al . , 2002 ; Reiner et al . , 2004a ) but do not project outside of Area X . Other interneuron types within Area X include fast spiking inhibitory interneurons and cholinergic interneurons ( Farries et al . , 2002 ) , which , in mammals , display spontaneous activi - ties of 0 – 10 Hz ( Mallet et al . , 2006 ) and 2 – 10 Hz ( Aosaki et al . , 1994 ) , respectively . Area X interneuron populations are gen - erally thought to display little or no spontaneous activity ( Farries and Perkel , 2002 ) , which distinguishes them from the only known projection neuron population of Area X , the pal - lidal neurons . We recorded the response to HVC electrical stimulation in 15 neurons with spontaneous firing below 25 sp / s ( mean of 11 . 5 (cid:6) 7 . 8 sp / s ) . These cells displayed very rapid responses to HVC stimulation , with most cells displaying la - tencies shorter than 5 ms ( mean of 5 . 9 (cid:6) 3 . 8 ms ) ( Fig . 7 ) . Their response was long in duration ( 25 (cid:6) 28 ms ) and very reliable ( response probability of 0 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 3 ) . Overall , Area X putative interneurons , at least some of which are inhibitory and project to pallildal neurons ( Farries et al . , 2005 ) , display very short - latency and long - duration responses to HVC stimulation , consistent with a role in conveying fast feedforward inhibition onto pallidal neurons that project to DLM .

Infusion of these drugs completely suppressed all Area X neuron responses to HVC stim - ulation ( Fig . 8 A , B ) , consistent with responses in Area X being mediated by direct excitatory projection from HVC to Area X neurons . Response strength ( see Materials and Methods ) was decreased by 98 . 5 (cid:6) 3 . 0 % ( 130 (cid:6) 91 vs 2 (cid:6) 3 % of baseline , n (cid:8) 4 , p (cid:8) 0 . 03 ) after drug infusion . In contrast , responses to HVC stimulation in Area X cells did not change after saline injection in Area X ( response strength from 56 (cid:6) 27 to 52 (cid:6) 38 % , n (cid:8) 3 , p (cid:8) 0 . 9 ) . Wethereforeconfirm , assuggestedbyFarriesetal . ( 2005 ) , that excitatory afferents from HVC drive fast excitation in Area X neurons . Local inhibition in Area X mediates fast inhibition of pallidal neurons If inhibitory responses to HVC stimulation in pallidal neurons are mediated by Area X GABAergic interneurons , they should be suppressed when GABAergic transmis - sion is blocked in Area X . In pallidal cells , injection of gabazine , a reversible GABA A receptor blocker , into Area X had several effects . First , drug application signifi - cantly increased spontaneous activity of the recorded pallidal cells from 48 . 2 (cid:6) 23 . 8 to 73 . 9 (cid:6) 36 . 9 sp / s ( n (cid:8) 10 , p (cid:8) 0 . 03 ) . In addition , the strength of the inhibitory component of the response to HVC stim - ulation was strongly decreased ( from 11 (cid:6) 5 to 4 (cid:6) 6 % , p (cid:8) 0 . 01 , n (cid:8) 4 ) ( Fig . 8 C , D ) , and its duration was not signifi - cantly changed ( from 6 (cid:6) 2 to 3 (cid:6) 6 ms , p (cid:8) 0 . 3 ) . In contrast , the excitatory com - ponent was significantly stronger ( from 63 (cid:6) 30 to 206 (cid:6) 158 % , n (cid:8) 10 , p (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) and longer in duration ( from 13 (cid:6) 6 to 35 (cid:6) 26 ms , p (cid:8) 0 . 02 ) . Close examination of excitatory response latencies calculated before and after drug infusion indicated that early inhibition , even when it was not visible in the PSTHs summarizing the re - sponse of a cell to HVC stimulation , de - layed the excitatory response to stimulation in these cells ( Fig . 8 C , D ) . As a result , latency of the excitatory compo - nent significantly decreased after gabazine injection ( from 12 . 4 (cid:6) 3 . 9 to 10 . 9 (cid:6) 4 . 4 ms , p (cid:8) 0 . 03 ) . This was also apparent in average PSTHs of all cells recorded after injection of gabazine into Area X aligned to HVC stimulation ( Fig . 8 E ) , showing that early inhibition delays the population response among pallidal cells to stimula - tion , whereas late inhibition shortens the response . These results indicate that the local in - hibitory network in Area X mediates feed - forward inhibition onto pallidal neurons . In half ( 48 . 8 % ) of the cells displaying in - hibition , feedforward inhibition arrived before direct excitation and could create sufficiently long ISIs in the input to DLM neu - rons to enable them to fire . Local inhibition in Area X is necessary for DLM responses If the short - latency response in DLM to HVC stimulation is evoked via a fast inhibition of the Area X pallidal neurons , it should be suppressed when GABAergic transmission is blocked in Area X . To test this hypothesis , we recorded DLM neuron responses to HVC stimulation while pharmacologically manipu - lating neurotransmission in Area X . Injection of the GABA A re - ceptor blocker gabazine into Area X caused no consistent change in DLM neuron spontaneous firing rate ( 5 (cid:6) 5 to 2 (cid:6) 2 sp / s , n (cid:8) 8 , p (cid:8) 0 . 2 ) .

Neurosci . , December9 , 2009 • 29 ( 49 ) : 15420 – 15433 • 15429 Glutamatergic transmission to the thalamus is not necessary for DLM responses Our results suggest that the response of DLM neurons is mainly driven by changes in their GABAergic input from pallidal cells . Alternatively , fast transmission be - tween HVC and DLM could be mediated through a polysynaptic excitatory path - way between these structures . Previous anatomical studies have shown that RA , which receives direct excitatory input from HVC ( Kubota and Saito , 1991 ; Mooney , 1992 ; Stark and Perkel , 1999 ) , projects to DLM ( Wild , 1993 ; Foster et al . , 1997 ; Vates et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , DLM neurons show AMPA receptor - mediated EPSPs ( Luo and Perkel , 1999b ) . Although the RA - to - DLM con - nection appears anatomically to be much weaker than the primary connec - tions of the song system ( Vates et al . , 1997 ) , it is a putative candidate for me - diating fast transmission between HVC and DLM . We tested whether glutamatergic transmission mediates fast responses in DLM by injecting the AMPA receptor blocker NBQX and the NMDA receptor blocker APV . The spontaneous firing rate wassignificantlydecreasedinthepresenceofthesedrugs ( 3 . 6 (cid:6) 3 . 6 to 1 . 9 (cid:6) 2 . 5 sp / s , n (cid:8) 7 , p (cid:8) 0 . 03 ) ( Fig . 10 A ) . In most DLM neurons , however , the response to HVC stimulation was not affected ( Fig . 10 B , C ) . The response strength was not signifi - cantly changed ( 140 (cid:6) 120 vs 90 (cid:6) 80 % , n (cid:8) 7 , p (cid:8) 0 . 4 ) , nor was the response la - tency ( 28 (cid:6) 22 to 27 (cid:6) 23 ms , p (cid:8) 0 . 7 ) . Moreover , when the analysis was restricted to neurons displaying a significant change in spontaneous firing rate after application of glutamate receptor blockers , similar results were obtained . Injection of vehicle solu - tion into DLM ( 0 . 9 % saline with 0 . 2 % DMSO and 0 . 5 % Alexa - fluor 488 ) did not modify either spontaneous activity ( 1 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 8 to 1 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 9 sp / s , n (cid:8) 3 , p (cid:8) 0 . 9 ) or responses to HVC stimulation ( response strength , 220 (cid:6) 20 vs 200 (cid:6) 60 % , p (cid:8) 0 . 6 ) , ruling out the possibility that our vehicle solution had any effect on DLM neurons . In summary , responses evoked in DLM by HVC stim - ulation persisted when glutamatergic transmission was blocked in DLM but were altered by manipulations in Area X , which makes a GABAergic projection to DLM . Very short - latency probabilistic responses to HVC stimulation in a simple DLM neuron model As shown above , DLM responses to HVC stimulation are medi - ated by fast disinhibition through Area X . Because these re - sponses do not rely on excitatory inputs to DLM , they most probably involve postinhibitory rebound in the thalamic neu - rons . However , the response latency to HVC stimulation is some - times as short as the rebound latency extrapolated from in vitro data ( PersonandPerkel , 2005 ) . Howcanthereboundprocessnot add an additional delay ? We investigated the mechanisms of rebound - driven responses in the thalamic neurons using a conductance - based model of a DLM neuron . In this model , we generated theoretical responses to the pallidal spike trains re - corded in response to HVC stimulation in 23 randomly selected pallidal neurons displaying an inhibitory response component ( Fig . 11 D ) . The spike trains drove an inhibitory synaptic conduc - tance in a model DLM neuron . We measured model DLM neu - ron spike times and analyzed the responses relative to the times of HVC stimulation with the same analyses applied to experimen - tally recorded spike trains . In 17 of 23 cases ( representing 23 unique pallidal trains ) , we found a significant increase in DLM model neuron activity after HVC stimulation , and the distribu - tion of the response latencies was very similar to that experimen - tally recorded in DLM neurons . In particular , the distribution was dominated by short - latency responses ( mean of 24 . 6 (cid:6) 32 . 3 ms , median of 14 ms ) ( Fig . 11 E ) . Moreover , like the recorded neurons , the probability of a response among the simulated DLM neurons was low , ranging from 0 . 04 to 0 . 9 , averaging 0 . 25 (cid:6) 0 . 29 . This simple test reveals that the HVC - evoked inhibition in Area X pallidal cells could evoke rebound firing of suitable probability and latency in a typical DLM neuron . Discussion We report here very fast signal propagation through an avian cortical – BG – thalamo - cortical pathway , with overall transmis - sion delays as short as 10 ms .

Large - diameter axons projecting from pallidal neurons to the thalamus may contribute to the speed of this process . Finally , thalamic responses do not depend on glutamatergic transmission and thus most likely in - volve postinhibitory rebound . These data reveal a new view of BG transmission whereby pallidal neurons continually send veto sig - nals that arrive just in time to prevent postsynaptic firing . Omis - sion or even slight delay of that inhibitory input triggers a nearly immediate thalamic response . Mechanism of fast response in DLM The main input to the thalamic nucleus DLM is GABAergic and consists of large calyx - like terminals of Area X pallidal neurons onto theDLMsoma ( OkuhataandSaito , 1987 ; Vatesetal . , 1997 ; Luoand Perkel , 1999a ) . In vitro , pallidal IPSPs strongly hyperpolarize DLM neurons , which then generate rebound action potentials with a 20 – 40 ms latency ( Luo and Perkel , 1999b ; PersonandPerkel , 2005 ) . Thislatencycould beshorter invivo , wherespikesinDLMneu - rons are consistently preceded by 10 – 20 ms intervals of silence of the inhibitory presyn - aptic terminals ( Person and Perkel , 2007 ) . These studies suggested that postinhibitory rebound mediates DLM firing in vivo but stopped short of pharmacological manipu - lation to test the contribution of pallidal fir - ing to DLM activity . Here , we provide evidence that feed - forward GABAergic inhibition triggered by HVC input onto pallidal neurons is necessary and sufficient to trigger a DLM response . In the absence of HVC input , the rapid and regular spontaneous activity of pallidal neurons induces IPSPs sepa - rated by 10 – 25 ms intervals , imposing a constant veto on DLM neuron firing . Presumably , this inhibition also hyperpo - larizes the membrane potential to voltages that ensure the availability of low - thres - hold calcium channels that support postin - hibitory rebound . A synchronized drive from HVC trig - gers fast feedforward inhibition of pallidal neurons in Area X . If the feedforward in - hibition arrives shortly after the last palli - dal spike , it will have little effect ( Fig . 11 B ) . If that inhibition arrives later in the pallidal ISI , it will delay the next spike ( Fig . 11 C ) and trigger an almost instanta - neous spike in the target DLM neuron . Indeed , DLM neuron membrane poten - tial rises after each presynaptic spike until it eventually reaches threshold unless an IPSP arrives to stop it ( Person and Perkel , 2005 ) . Note that , in vivo , the rise in mem - brane potential might result from a com - bination of postinhibitory rebound and concurrent excitatory inputs , although the latter appear not to be necessary for DLM responses . Increased firing rates preceding long ISIs in the presynaptic pallidal terminal might be important for DLM neuron firing ( Person and Perkel , 2007 ; Kojima and Doupe , 2009 ) . Consistent with intracellular recordings ( Person and Perkel , 2005 ) , we pro - pose that increases in pallidal firing rate , such as those observed during song playback , shorten the delay to DLM rebound spikes and increase the firing probability in response to a given presyn - aptic ISI . However , our results show that such an increase in activity preceding long ISIs is neither necessary nor sufficient to evoke DLM responses , pointing to a critical role for BG feedfor - ward inhibition . Although we have shown that short pauses ( (cid:2) 20 – 50 ms ) in pal - lidal activity allow fast thalamic responses , longer inactivation of pallidal neurons ( more than seconds ) also leads to increased spon - taneous thalamic activity ( Kojima and Doupe , 2009 ) . Whether this “ungated” thalamic activity relies on excitatory synaptic drive or on DLM neuron excitability remains to be determined . Based on our results , information propagating through the AFP might reach RA faster than was anticipated previously Figure 11 . Working model of information transmission between HVC and DLM .

In that study , peaks of correlated activity between HVC and LMAN led to estimated propagation latencies of (cid:2) 60 ms . However , many paired recordings showed only a single broad correlation peak , possibly reflecting faster transmis - sion through the AFP . Our approach using electrical stimulation reduces ambiguity in the signal start time and led to our observa - tion of much faster propagation speeds than observed previously . Relation to function BG circuits in general and the AFP in particular are proposed to introduce variability necessary for exploration during motor learning ( Graybiel , 2005 ; Kao et al . , 2005 ; Olveczky et al . , 2005 ) . Where within the neural circuit does this variability arise ? LMAN neuron spontaneous activity is very irregular , suggesting one source . Moreover , we show here that the response of DLM neu - rons to activation of cortical areas is highly unreliable . The suc - cess or failure of a response , determined by the relative timing of the HVC input to the preceding pallidal spike ( Fig . 11 ) , could introduce variability in LMAN response timing . Indeed , assum - ing LMAN neurons receive convergent input from many DLM neurons , theymaybeactivatedwithdifferentlatenciesdepending on which population of presynaptic neurons is active . In addition to introducing variability , the AFP may provide patterned signals to guide changes in motor output ( Kao et al . , 2008 ) . Such signals would most likely come from HVC and be transformed in the AFP , potentially through dopamine - dependent mechanisms . Indeed , dopamine could alter informa - tion flow through Area X depending on the social context ( Sasaki et al . , 2006 ) through short - or long - term synaptic effects ( Ding and Perkel , 2004 ) . In this view , an overlap in RA with the “pro - duction signal” sent through the monosynaptic HVC – RA path - way would provide the AFP signal with a simple mechanism to alter online behavior . Because song - related signals are very short ( 10 – 20 ms ) ( Hahnloser et al . , 2002 ; Kozhevnikov and Fee , 2007 ) , there is not much time for transmission through the AFP . Our results suggest that latencies through the AFP might be shorter than 20 ms and would thus allow interaction of motor pathway and AFP signals within RA . Comparison with mammalian BG Area X differs from mammalian BG in its gross anatomical struc - ture but displays similar circuitry at a finer scale . Indeed , Area X comprises primarily striatal neurons , but , consistent with mam - malian circuitry , it is its pallidal component that directly projects to the thalamus ( Bottjer et al . , 1989 ; Luo and Perkel , 1999a ; Farries and Perkel , 2002 ; Carrillo and Doupe , 2004 ; Reiner at al . , 2004a ) . It contains the anatomical substrate for a disinhibitory pathway homologous to the direct pathway through mammalian BG ( Reiner et al . , 2004a ; Farries et al . , 2005 ) , which , as shown here , is functionally critical . Indeed , afferents from the cortical structure HVC drive feedforward inhibition in BG output through striatal neurons and disinhibit thalamic target neurons . Interestingly , avian striatal inhibitory neurons may require high synchronization of their cortical inputs to drive such feedforward inhibition , similar to striatal medium spiny neurons ( Charpier et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast to mammalian pallidal neurons , Area X out - putneuronsalsoreceivemonosynapticinputfromcorticalglutama - tergic afferents ( Farries et al . , 2005 ) . This input provides a powerful and sensitive drive to pallidal neurons , with broadly distributed la - tencies , consistent with previous estimations of transmission delays fromHVCtoAreaX ( Hahnloseretal . , 2006 ) . Thisconnectionmight provide Area X with a pathway functionally equivalent to the “hy - perdirect” pathway through the subthalamic nucleus in mammals ( Nambuetal . , 2000 ) , whichisnotconnectedwithAreaX ( Personet al . , 2008 ) . This analog of the hyperdirect pathway may increase the selectivity of disinhibitory signals transmitted through the direct pathway both spatially , by broadly inhibiting DLM during focused disinhibition , and temporally , by limiting the duration of the disin - hibitory signal ( Nambu et al . , 2000 ) . Speed specialization The AFP may be an example of a BG circuit specialized for rapid processing of cortical inputs . First , BG output axons have very large diameters ( 3 (cid:1) m ) for vertebrate CNS neurons , especially compared with their mammalian counterparts ( (cid:5) 1 (cid:1) m in rats ) ( Bodor et al . , 2008 ) or with other axons in the zebra finch brain ( (cid:5) 1 (cid:1) m ) , allowing fast conduction . Second , in contrast with the mammalian BG motor loop , in which transmission along the direct pathway is slower than feedforward excitation through the subthalamic nucleus ( Nambu et al . , 2000 ) , feedforward inhi - bitionissurprisinglyfastinthesong - relatedBG . Indeed , itarrives fast enough to prevent or slow the rise of monosynaptic excita - tion from cortical structures . This rapid feedforward inhibition is mediated by GABAergic Area X neurons , most likely interneu - rons . In particular , it might involve the fast - spiking interneurons , whichprovidefastfeedforwardinhibitioninthemammalianstri - atum ( Mallet et al . , 2006 ) and are present in Area X ( Farries et al . , 2002 ; Reiner et al . , 2004a ) . The mammalian pallido - thalamic connection displays pow - erful GABAergic synapses similar to those seen in songbirds ( Bodor et al . , 2008 ; Wanaverbecq et al . , 2008 ) ; the cellular mech - anisms described here may well be at least partially available in mammals . Whereas motor output often operates on longer time - scales ( (cid:1) 100 ms ) in mammals , specific BG systems involved in fast sensorimotor tasks such as speech in humans or whisking in rats are subjected to similar constraints as the AFP . Although information propagation has not yet been carefully characterized in these circuits , they may display similar specializations for fast transmission as those presented here .
