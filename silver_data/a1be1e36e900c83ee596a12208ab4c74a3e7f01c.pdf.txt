Substrate ﬂexibility regulates growth and apoptosis of nor - mal but not transformed cells . Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 279 : C1345 – C1350 , 2000 . —One of the hallmarks of oncogenic transformation is anchorage - independent growth ( 27 ) . Here we demonstrate that responses to substrate rigidity play a major role in distinguishing the growth behavior of normal cells from that of transformed cells . We cultured normal or H - ras - transformed NIH 3T3 cells on ﬂexible collagen - coated polyacrylamide substrates with similar chemical properties but different rigidity . Compared with cells cultured on stiff substrates , nontransformed cells on ﬂexible substrates showed a decrease in the rate of DNA synthesis and an increase in the rate of apoptosis . These responses on ﬂexible substrates are coupled to decreases in cell spreading area and traction forces . In contrast , transformed cells main - tained their growth and apoptotic characteristics regardless of substrate ﬂexibility . The responses in cell spreading area and traction forces to substrate ﬂexibility were similarly diminished . Our results suggest that normal cells are capa - ble of probing substrate rigidity and that proper mechanical feedback is required for regulating cell shape , cell growth , and survival . The loss of this response can explain the un - regulated growth of transformed cells . mechanical signaling ; cell cycle ; cell shape ; traction force ; cancer ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED for many years that adhesions with substrates or other cells regulate the growth of normal but not transformed cells , little is known about the nature of such anchorage - dependent regulation . To date most emphasis has been placed on characterizing the integrin receptor complexes ( 14 ) , the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) - integrin binding inter - actions ( 19 ) , and the downstream signaling events ( 10 ) . However , physical forces at adhesion sites may play an equally important role , as evidenced by the responses of cell morphology , growth , apoptosis , and gene expres - sion to mechanical forces such as ﬂuid shear stress ( 6 ) or substrate stretching ( 1 , 11 , 20 ) . It is possible that the main function of receptor binding is to establish a physical linkage between the cytoplasm and the out - side environment , whereas subsequent physical inter - actions through such linkages elicit the actual enzy - matic reactions on the cytoplasmic side of adhesion sites . Our recent observations further indicate that normal cells not only respond to mechanical forces but actively probe substrate ﬂexibility , most likely by applying con - tractile forces to the substrate and responding to the feedback of counterforces ( 21 , 23 ) . When plated on ﬂexible substrates , normal cells show enhanced motil - ity and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation ( 21 ) . Thus an attractive hypothesis is that normal cells may regulate their motility , growth , and apoptosis according to me - chanical properties of the substrate , whereas trans - formed cells may be defective in either detecting or responding to such mechanical signals . Although previous observations have provided strong evidence that cell - substrate adhesions play a key role in regulating cell growth ( 14 ) , it has not been possible to identify speciﬁcally the role of physical parameters because of the use of substrates that differ in both chemical and physical properties . To address this problem , we recently developed ECM - coated poly - acrylamide substrates , which , through minor changes in the concentration of cross - linkers , allowed the reg - ulation of ﬂexibility over a wide range without altering their chemical properties . In this study , we cultured normal or H - ras - transformed 3T3 cells on substrates of different ﬂexibility and compared their rates of growth and apoptosis , as well as cell spreading area and trac - tion forces exerted on the substrate . We found that normal cells are much more sensitive to substrate ﬂexibility than transformed cells . Our data can explain the growth advantage of transformed cells in vivo , where they are able to survive and grow independent of mechanical input from the surrounding tissues . METHODS Preparation of polyacrylamide substrate . Polyacrylamide substrates coated with collagen I were prepared essentially as described previously ( 23 , 28 ) . The ﬂexibility of the sub - strate was manipulated by maintaining the total acrylamide concentration while varying the bis - acrylamide concentra - tion . Experiments with growth and apoptosis were performed with substrates of 5 % total acrylamide and bis - acrylamide between 0 . 012 and 0 . 06 % .

This change was necessary for generating high - quality sub - strate deformation vectors appropriate for computer analysis ( too soft a substrate causes surface ﬂuorescent beads to lie on different planes of focus as cells exert forces ) . Before cells were plated , the acrylamide gels were soaked for 30 min in DMEM at 37°C . Cell culture and microscopy . NIH 3T3 cells ( ATCC , Rock - ville , MD ) and H - ras - transformed NIH 3T3 cells ( PAP2 ) were kindly supplied by Dr . Ann Chambers ( London Regional Cancer Center , London , Ontario , Canada ; Refs . 2 , 3 ) , and were cultured in DMEM ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , supple - mented with 10 % donor calf serum ( JRH Biosciences , Le - nexa , KS ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , 50 m g / ml streptomycin , 50 U / ml penicillin , and 250 m g / ml amphotercin B ( GIBCO - BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Images were recorded with a Zeiss 3 40 , NA 0 . 75 Plan - Neoﬂuar objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 10 mi - croscope , using a cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Series 200 , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Assay of DNA synthesis . Twenty - four or forty - eight hours after plating , NIH 3T3 and PAP2 cells were incubated with 100 m M 5 - bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ; Sigma ) in DMEM for 1 . 5 h at 37°C . Cells were then processed for immunoﬂuores - cence staining for BrdU as follows : cellular DNA was di - gested with DNase I ( 1 mg / ml in 10 mM Tris z HCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 5 ) for 20 min at 37°C before incubation with primary monoclonal antibodies against BrdU ( 1 : 200 ; Clone BU - 33 , Sigma ) . The secondary antibody was Alexa 546 - la - beled goat anti - mouse IgG ( H 1 L ) antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( 10 m g / ml , Sigma ) for 10 min at room temper - ature before observation with ﬂuorescence microscopy . The percentage of BrdU ( 1 ) cells was calculated by counting 200 cells in multiple ﬁelds in each experiment . The results are shown as means 6 SE from ﬁve independent experiments . Assay of apoptosis . Quantitation of apoptotic cells by ter - minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) at 24 or 48 h after cells were plated on collagen - coated polyacrylamide substrates . Brieﬂy , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS , pH 7 . 4 , for 30 min at room tempera - ture , then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % so - dium citrate for 2 min on ice . After incubation with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37°C , cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( 10 m g / ml , Sigma ) for 10 min at room temperature before observation with ﬂuores - cence microscopy . The percentage of apoptotic cells was cal - culated by counting 200 cells in multiple ﬁelds in each exper - iment . The results are shown as means 6 SE from ﬁve independent experiments . Calculation of traction forces and cell spreading area . Trac - tion forces generated by the cell were determined as de - scribed previously ( 7 , 17 ) . The deformation of the substrate due to cell - generated stresses was detected based on the displacement of embedded ﬂuorescent beads near the sub - strate surface . Young’s modulus of the substrate was esti - mated based on the depression created by the weight of a 0 . 65 - mm steel ball , using an equation derived from the Hertz theory as was applied previously in atomic force microscopy ( 17 , 25 ) . Calculation of traction was carried out on a super - computer , using the displacement vectors , the cell boundary , the Young’s modulus , and the Poisson’s ratio as the input . Average traction was calculated within regions that gener - ated signiﬁcant tractions . Brieﬂy , the uncertainty of calcula - tion at each pixel ( 7 ) was compared with the magnitude of traction . Pixels with a corresponding traction below the esti - mated uncertainty were excluded from averaging . This pro - cedure minimizes the impact of cell spreading on average traction . Otherwise , because tractions were usually conﬁned in limited peripheral areas while most regions near the nucleus generated no signiﬁcant force ( 7 ) , global averaging would cause peripheral exerted tractions to be diluted ac - cording to the degree of cell spreading . Cell spreading area was measured by counting the number of image pixels within the cell boundary using custom software . RESULTS To test the hypothesis that normal cells respond not only to the occupancy of the integrins by anchored ECM molecules but also to the rigidity of the substrate , we cultured 3T3 cells on ﬂexible collagen I - coated poly - acrylamide sheets . Substrates of similar chemical property but different rigidity were prepared by main - taining a constant total concentration of acrylamide while varying the concentration of bis - acrylamide ( 23 , 28 ) . The substrates used for the measurement of cell growth and apoptosis rates have a Young’s modulus varying between 4 . 7 and 14 kN / m 2 . In the following discussion , these substrates will be referred to as ﬂex - ible and stiff substrates , respectively . To study the effects of transformation on cellular responses to substrate ﬂexibility , we compared normal NIH 3T3 cells with PAP2 cells , a line of H - ras - trans - formed NIH 3T3 cells selected for their ability to me - tastasize in chick embryos ( 2 , 3 ) . Unlike some highly transformed cells , PAP2 cells require some ECM inter - actions for their growth , as they did not multiply or survive on bare polyacrylamide substrate without col - lagen I coating . Thus the following results on growth and apoptosis reﬂect differential downstream re - sponses to integrins bound to collagen - coated surfaces of different ﬂexibility . Effects of substrate ﬂexibility on cell growth and apoptosis . We ﬁrst studied the effects of substrate ﬂexibility on cell growth by measuring the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU ( Fig . 1 ) . Cells were plated at a density of 1 , 000 / cm 2 onto either stiff or soft sub - strates . For normal cells , an approximately twofold difference in the rate of BrdU incorporation was ob - served 24 h after plating on ﬂexible versus stiff sub - strates ( Fig . 1 B ) . This difference became even more pronounced at 48 h ( ; 4 - fold ) . For H - ras - transformed cells , the rate of growth was not affected signiﬁcantly by the substrate ﬂexibility . It is also worth noting that , on stiff substrates at a limited cell density , H - ras - transformed 3T3 cells showed no growth advantage over nontransformed cells . However , on ﬂexible sub - strates , transformed cells grew at a rate approximately twofold higher than that for nontransformed cells after 48 h of plating ( Fig . 1 B ) . To minimize the effects of cell - cell interactions , which may affect the rate of DNA synthesis , the exper - iments were also performed with a low cell density of 250 / cm 2 . At this density , most normal and transformed cells remained as single cells 24 h after plating . How - ever , the response of DNA synthesis to substrate ﬂex - C1346 SUBSTRATE FLEXIBILITY REGULATES CELL GROWTH AND APOPTOSIS b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 246 on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p c e ll . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ibility was similar to that seen at higher densities ( Fig . 1 B ) . From these experiments , we conclude that cell cycle of normal cells is regulated by the rigidity of the substrate and that this regulation is lost in trans - formed cells . To complement the measurements of cell cycle rate , the rate of apoptosis was measured with a ﬂuorescent TUNEL assay ( 9 ) . We observed an approximately two - fold increase in apoptotic rate for nontransformed cells cultured on ﬂexible substrates compared with those on stiff substrates ( Fig . 2 ) . At 48 h , the apoptotic rate of normal cells on stiff substrate decreased to , 5 % , whereas the rate on ﬂexible substrates remained at 30 – 35 % . Contrary to normal cells , transformed cells showed no signiﬁcant difference in apoptosis on ﬂexible or stiff substrates ( Fig . 2 ) . The rate of apoptosis re - mained at 15 – 20 % at both 24 and 48 h . These results were unchanged when cells were cultured at a very low density ( 250 / cm 2 ; Fig . 2 B ) . As for DNA synthesis , transformed cells showed an advantage over normal cells only on ﬂexible substrates . When cells were plated on soft substrates at high densities or allowed to grow to a high density , both normal and transformed cells formed highly packed , tissuelike aggregates ( Fig . 3 A ) . Time - lapse recording indicated that these aggregates were formed by active migration and incorporation of cells into the mass . However , only normal cells responded to aggregation in their growth and apoptosis rates ; those within ag - gregates showed lower rates in both cell growth and apoptosis , reminiscent of changes during tissue forma - tion ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Transformed cells , on the other hand , showed no difference in the rates of DNA synthesis or apoptosis within the aggregates ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . To rule out the possibility that the reduced growth and increased apoptosis of normal cells on ﬂexible substrates were due to deﬁciency in collagen I coating , we ﬁrst performed RIA to determine the relative amount of collagen I coupled to the polyacrylamide sheets . We found that ﬂexible substrates ( 0 . 012 % bis - acrylamide ) had about twofold higher total collagen Fig . 1 . Effects of substrate ﬂexibility on DNA synthesis of normal and H - ras - transformed NIH 3T3 cells . A : normal ( a – d ) or transformed ( e – h ) cells were cul - tured on ﬂexible ( 0 . 012 % bis - acrylamide ; a , b , e , f ) or stiff ( 0 . 06 % bis - acrylamide ; c , d , g , h ) polyacrylamide substrates for 48 h before incubation with 5 - bromode - oxyuridine ( BrdU ) for 1 . 5 h . The cells were then pro - cessed for immunoﬂuorescence staining with antibod - ies against BrdU ( b , d , f , h ) and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( a , c , e , g ) . Cells undergoing DNA syn - thesis were stained with both agents . The percentage of cells undergoing DNA synthesis at 24 h ( at 2 different cell densities ) and 48 h after plating is shown in B as means 6 SE from 5 independent experiments .

A second assay , based on ﬂuorescence measurements using antibodies conjugated to ﬂuorescent particles ( and unable to pen - etrate into the substrate ) , indicated that the surface density of collagen was similar between stiff and soft substrates ( 17 ) . Even if there were more collagen on soft substrates , the difference should promote , rather than inhibit , cell growth and survival ( 18 ) . Thus ﬂexi - bility played a dominant role over receptor occupancy in regulating DNA synthesis and apoptosis . Effects of substrate ﬂexibility on cell spreading and traction forces . The effects of substrate ﬂexibility are likely linked to changes in cell morphology , spreading , and / or mechanical interactions with the substrate . Previous studies have correlated the rate of cell growth with the degree of cell spreading on stiff substrates of different chemical properties ( 8 ) . We found that when cultured on polyacrylamide substrates , normal cells showed a signiﬁcant decrease in spreading area when the Young’s modulus decreased from 33 to 14 kN / m 2 ( Table 1 ) . H - ras - transformed cells showed no apparent decrease in spreading area over this range of ﬂexibility ( Table 1 ) and became less spread only upon further decrease in Young’s modulus to , 10 kN / m 2 . Our polyacrylamide substrates also allowed us to measure traction forces exerted by cells on the sub - strate . The method is based on mathematical analysis of the pattern of deformation of the ﬂexible substrate , as detected by the movement of embedded ﬂuorescent beads ( 7 ) . We found that tractions generated by normal cells were signiﬁcantly stronger on stiff substrates than on soft substrates . Traction forces generated by transformed cells , on the other hand , showed no signif - icant difference on stiff or ﬂexible substrates ( Table 1 ) . DISCUSSION To address speciﬁcally the impact of mechanical in - put on cell growth , we cultured cells on ﬂexible poly - acrylamide substrates that have similar chemical Fig . 2 .

A : nor - mal ( a - d ) and transformed ( e - h ) cells were cultured on ﬂexible ( 0 . 012 % bis - acrylamide ; a , b , e , f ) or stiff ( 0 . 06 % bis - acrylamide ; c , d , g , h ) polyacrylamide substrates for 48 h and then processed for the terminal deoxynucleo - tidyl transferase - mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) assay ( b , d , f , h ) and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( a , c , e , g ) . Cells undergoing apoptosis were stained with both agents . The apoptotic index at 24 h ( at 2 different cell densities ) and 48 h after cell plating is shown in B as means 6 SE from 5 indepen - dent experiments .

The growth and motile behaviors of cells on stiff sub - strates are generally similar to those on glass or plastic surfaces . However , striking differences are observed as the ﬂexibility increases , indicating that normal cells respond to not only the occupancy of the ECM receptors but mechanical signals transmitted through these re - ceptors . It has long been recognized that the degree of cell spreading is correlated with the rate of cell growth . Folkman and Moscona ( 8 ) ﬁrst demonstrated that DNA synthesis in nontransformed cells increases as the cell becomes increasingly spread on more adhesive sub - strates , whereas transformed cells grew independently of cell shape or substrate adhesiveness . This is sup - ported by a subsequent study indicating a progressive loss of shape - responsive metabolic control in trans - formed cells ( 29 ) . Recent experiments by Ingber and coworkers ( 4 , 13 , 15 , 26 ) further demonstrated changes in growth and apoptosis rates of normal cells under equivalent integrin occupancy but different geometry . However , although most previous studies have empha - sized the importance of cell shape ( 4 , 8 , 12 , 15 ) , little is known about the physical / chemical parameters linking cell spreading / cell shape with the progression of cell cycle . From both previous and the present studies ( 21 ) , we propose that it is the mechanical input associated with shape change that regulates the cell cycle . To detect chemically identical but physically different surfaces , cells must rely on an active probing mechanism using contractile forces . Mechanical input from the sub - strate , transmitted through adhesion receptors , then activates downstream signals that regulate both the degree of cell spreading and the rate of growth . On stiff substrates , resistance to mechanical probing may lead to protein conformational changes and activation of signaling enzymes at the adhesion sites ( 5 , 22 ) . The response in turn causes an increase in traction forces and in cell spreading ( Table 1 ) . Activation of down - stream chemical events may follow as a result of the direct activation of regulatory pathways or as a conse - quence of changes in cell shape or surface - to - volume ratio ( 4 ) , leading to increased DNA synthesis and de - creased apoptosis ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . In contrast to normal cells , H - ras - transformed cells appear to be locked in a nonresponsive state in terms of substrate ﬂexibility . They exert a similar magnitude of traction forces irre - Fig . 3 . Aggregation of cells on ﬂexible substrates and its effects on cell growth and apoptosis .

C : the apo - ptotic index was signiﬁcantly lower for normal cells inside the aggregates than outside the aggregates .

Traction forces and cell spreading area of NIH 3T3 cells on stiff substrates were signiﬁcantly larger than those on soft substrates ( P 5 0 . 027 and 0 . 014 , respectively ) . No statistically signiﬁcant difference was found for PAP2 cells on different substrates .

Therefore , although additional defects in signal transduction are likely , the lack of response of traction forces to substrate ﬂexibility in PAP2 cells may be sufﬁcient to cause defects in the regulation of cell growth . For other types of trans - formed cells , the regulatory mechanism may break - down at other levels , for example , through degradation of the ECM ( 3 ) , deactivation of the force - sensing mech - anism , or changes in the expression of integrin recep - tors ( 23 ) . The defects in mechanical response of H - ras - trans - formed cells may lead to signiﬁcant growth advantages in the body , which consists largely of ﬂexible tissues . At low cell densities on ﬂexible substrates , normal cells suffered from both increased apoptotic death and re - duced growth , whereas transformed cells maintained their rates of growth and apoptosis as on stiff sub - strates . At high densities , cell - cell contacts and aggre - gation became dominant . It protects normal cells from apoptosis but also inhibits their growth , whereas transformed cells grow independently of aggregate for - mation ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus transformed cells show a clear growth advantage over normal cells on ﬂexible sub - strates at both low and high cell densities . Cellular responses to substrate ﬂexibility , stretch - ing , and ﬂuid shear may share a common mechanism involving active probing the environment and re - sponses to mechanical forces . For nontransformed cells , this mechanism likely plays an important role during embryonic development and wound healing , allowing cellular proliferation or apoptosis to be regu - lated in response to changes in physical properties of the environment . Conversely , defects in mechanical signals may allow transformed cells to survive through the blood stream and to proliferate in diverse tissue environment . We gratefully acknowledge Dr . Ann F .
