However their production remains challenging as adherent cells proposed to secrete therapeutic extra cellular vesicles require scalable platforms . In addition , the role of biomaterials design parameters on processes regulating vesicular secretory phenotypes is unclear . Here we propose the use of bioactive microdroplets , or bioemulsions , as microcarriers for the culture of mesenchymal stem cells and production of exosomes . We demonstrate 100 % increase in the output of extracellular vesicles on bioemulsions . The impact of matrix mechanics on this process is then investigated , and in particular interfacial shear mechanical properties of corresponding liquid - liquid interfaces forming microdroplets . We find that such local nanoscale mechanics regulates not only cell adhesion , but also exosome output . We find that exosomes generated by cells cultured on bioemulsion microdroplets retain a high content of protein and RNA cargos . Finally , we demonstrate that the cold - shock protein YBox 1 , previously associated with RNA packaging , is modulated by matrix mechanics and regulates exosome production . Together , these results demonstrate the impact of local interfacial mechanics on the adhesion and secretory machinery and provide a proof of concept for the application of bioemulsions for the production of complex biotherapeutics . 3 Introduction Stem cell - based therapies may allow tackling a wide range of conditions and diseases , whether based on mesenchymal stromal cells of various origins or whether based on induced pluripotent stem cells [ 1 – 3 ] . Underlying this regenerative potential , the secretory phenotype of these cells , in particular associated with pro - angiogenic factors , has been proposed to play a central role in tissue regeneration [ 4 – 6 ] . Extra - cellular vesicles ( EVs ) such as exosomes have emerged as important biotherapeutics orchestrating reparative processes and , in turn , present important potential for cell - free stem cell therapies [ 7 ] . Indeed , such approach enables harnessing some of the crucial regenerative potential of stem cells whilst minimising risks associated with cell therapies , such as tumorigenicity and immunogenicity . EVs are classified according to two sub - categories , based on their biogenesis pathways [ 8 ] : exosomes range in size from 30 to 150 nm and originate from multi - vesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , while microvesicles are larger ( size range of 100 - 1000 nm ) and bud directly from the cell membrane [ 8 , 9 ] . Exosome biogenesis is initiated in the endosome , followed by maturation in the late endosome and MVBs . Accumulation of intraluminal vesicles through endosomal membrane invagination leads to fusion with the cell membrane and release of exosomes in the extracellular space . These processes are orchestrated by a complex molecular machinery , within which ESCRT and heat shock proteins ( e . g . Hsp90 ) play a central role , regulating invagination , fusion , budding and pinching events [ 8 , 10 ] . In addition , GTPases such as Rab proteins regulate transportation of MVBs along the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton during exosome genesis [ 11 , 12 ] . Maturation is also associated with the recruitment of specific proteins and biomacromolecules often used as exosomal markers , such as tetraspanins CD63 and CD9 and micro RNAs [ 13 ] . Finally , although molecules such as Y - box protein 1 ( Ybox1 ) have recently been implicated in miRNA sorting within exosomes [ 10 ] [ 14 – 17 ] , detailed mechanisms controlling the packaging of biomacromolecules within exosomes remain unclear . The control of exosomal production and composition indeed appears essential , given the role of exosomes in distant signalling , for example in pathological scenarios such as metastasis [ 12 , 18 , 19 ] , in which changes in exosome production and matrix stiffness correlate . Indeed , matrix stiffness was found to promote exosome secretion and induce a more aggressive tumour phenotype [ 20 ] . This was found to be mediated through an Akt - Rab8 activation mechanism , directly linked to focal adhesion response to an increase in modulus of the matrix . Such processes not only 4 upregulated exosome production , but also impacted their composition , for example their enrichment in Jagged1 , in turn impacting signalling through the Notch pathway . Similarly , exosome production was enhanced in breast cancer cells cultured on stiff matrices and resulted in activation of cell motility and matrix degradation , priming for invasiveness [ 21 ] . Matrix stiffness and geometry were shown to regulate vesicular trafficking and exocytosis , through RhoA and Akt activation [ 22 , 23 ] . The exosomes secreted by periodontal ligament stem cells in response to mechanical stretch were found to display altered composition ( in particular miRNA content ) , compared to unstretched samples , in turn affecting the phenotype of targeted cells ( in this work , MSCs ) [ 24 ] . Surprisingly , exosome production by MSCs was recently found to be upregulated on soft hydrogels ( therefore impacting output ) , without impacting on exosomal composition and therapeutic potential [ 25 ] . However , detailed mechanisms via which MSC exosome production is regulated by matrix mechanics and how this may modulate composition and therapeutic cargo packaging remain unclear . The impact of nanoscale mechanics and mechanical heterogeneity or anisotropy , which are increasingly recognised to play a central role in the regulation of adherent cell phenotype [ 26 ] , on EV production have also not been investigated . Therefore , the mechanical properties of the matrix are emerging as important parameters enabling the regulation of exosome and EV output , and should be engineered in the design of platforms enabling the production scale up of these cell - free complex therapeutics . In this respect , 3D bioreactors making use of microcarriers to support cell adhesion ( often in the context of mesenchymal stromal cells ) , cell expansion and exosome release have received significant attention [ 27 – 29 ] . Indeed , an important issue for the translation of exosomes for regenerative medicine remains their large - scale production [ 7 , 27 ] . The low yields associated with exosome production limit the expected biological outcome from such therapies and pre - clinical studies have indicated that effective therapeutic dosages in mice require 10 9 – 10 11 EVs scales ( corresponding to 10 – 100 μg of exosomal proteins ) , while most studies report less than 1 μg / mL protein yields [ 28 , 30 , 31 ] . As a consequence , such high quantities of EVs require the culture of high cell densities and associated costs of medium and microcarriers ( for 3D bioreactor production ) [ 9 , 32 ] . Microdroplet technologies constitute an emerging platform for the culture and scale up of adherent cell expansion . Indeed , protein assemblies allowing the stabilisation of microdroplets can be engineered to form crosslinked networks at the liquid - liquid interface , resulting in the formation of protein nanosheets with strong nanoscale ( interfacial ) mechanical properties [ 33 – 36 ] . When 5 combined with their functionalisation with bioactive moieties , for example peptide or ECM proteins ligating integrin receptors , protein nanosheet - stabilised microdroplets sustain the adhesion , spreading and expansion of adherent cells , including keratinocytes , mesenchymal stem cells , induced pluripotent stem cells and HEK293 cells [ 37 – 43 ] . Mesenchymal stromal cells adhering and proliferating at the surface of protein - nanosheet stabilised liquid interfaces were found to retain the expression of key stem cell markers and their multipotency , even upon long term culture [ 37 ] . In addition , these cells retained a secretory phenotype and conditioned a microenvironment that primed the formation of biomimetic adipose - rich bone marrow niches , enabling the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and their scale up in conical flask bioreactors [ 44 ] . Beyond fluorinated oils routinely used in microdroplet technologies , for example for single cell RNA sequencing [ 45 – 47 ] , a broader range of silicone , mineral and plant based oils have also been applied for the culture of MSCs [ 48 ] , enabling the use of biomedical grade materials for cell expansion . Therefore , bioactive emulsions , or bioemulsions ( emulsions based on microdroplets stabilised by surfactants presenting direct bioactive properties ) , offer advantages over solid or hydrogel microcarriers , which are difficult to process , relatively costly and can introduce microplastic contaminants in the cell products . However , the ability of bioemulsions to support the production of complex therapeutics such as exosomes and EVs , and how the nanoscale mechanics of corresponding protein nanosheet - stabilised interfaces , has not been investigated yet . In this report , we propose the use of bioemulsions for the production of MSC - derived exosomes and extracellular vesicles . The nanoscale mechanical properties of corresponding liquid - liquid interfaces stabilised by protein nanosheets are characterised and the impact of the strong nanoscale shear mechanics of these interfaces on MSC adhesion and EV production is investigated . The broader impact of matrix mechanics on EV release is then explored in the context of poly ( acrylamide ) hydrogels , in comparison to tissue culture plastic and bioemulsions . The role of cytoskeleton tension and assembly on EV production is examined . Finally , the impact of matrix compliance on the composition of EVs is characterised and the mechanism of mechanosensing of associated secretory phenotype , including the role of the translational regulator YBox1 , is examined . 6 7 Materials and Methods Emulsion preparation and functionalisation . To generate emulsions , 1 mL of fluorinated oil ( Novec 7500 , ACOTA ) and 2 mL of protein solution ( β - lactoglobulin ; > 90 % , Sigma , from bovine milk , at a concentration of 1 mg / mL in PBS ) were added into a glass vial . The vial was vigorously shaken ( Vortex , 10 s ) to form the emulsion and left for 1h at room temperature . The upper liquid phase was aspirated and replaced with PBS six times . The droplet surface was functionalised as described before [ 49 ] . Briefly , sulfo - succinimidyl - 4 - ( N - maleimidomethyl ) cyclohexane - l - carboxylate ( sulfo - SMCC , Sigma , at a concentration of 2 mg / mL in PBS ) were added to the emulsion and kept to react for 1 h at room temperature . The upper liquid phase was aspirated and replaced with PBS 3 times . The peptide solution ( CGGRGDSPG , Proteogenix , free of TFA , 1 . 6 mg / mL in PBS ; 2 mL ) was added to the emulsion and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . The upper liquid phase was aspirated and replaced with PBS 3 times followed by washing ( 3 times ) with cell culture medium . The samples were kept in cell culture medium for at least 30 minutes before cell seeding . Polyacrylamide ( PAAm ) hydrogels formation . The PAAm hydrogels were prepared and characterised as described previously [ 50 , 51 ] . Briefly , air plasma - activated coverslips were functionalised with methacrylate residues by incubation in solutions of 3 - ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( 90 µ L , Fisher ) in anhydrous toluene ( 30 mL , Fisher ) overnight , at room temperature , followed by washing with copious amounts of ethanol and water . Then , 40 % acrylamide ( Sigma ) and 2 % bis - acrylamide ( Sigma ) stock solutions were mixed at ratios of 1 : 250 and 3 : 160 ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide ) to form gels of 2 kPa and 115 kPa stiffness’s , respectively . PAAm gels were formed on the functionalised coverslips of 13 and 35 mm diameter in order to be placed in 24 - and 6 - well plates , respectively . Before cell seeding , the hydrogels were kept in 1 % antibiotic solution ( Penicillin - Streptomycin 5 , 000 U / mL ; Thermo Fisher ) at 4⁰C overnight . Hydrogels were washed extensively with PBS and activated via photoirradiation ( 365 nm , 0 . 8 mW for 5 minutes ) with sulfosuccinimidyl - 6 - 4’ - azido - 2’ - nitrophenylamino hexanoate ( Sulfo - SANPAH ; Thermo Scientific Pierce ) . To do so , 20 µ L of sulfo - SANPAH stock solution ( DMSO 50 mg / mL ) was diluted into 980 µ L deionised water . A volume of 100 µ L or 300 µ L was added to each gel ( volumes corresponding to 24 - or 6 - well plates , respectively ) . Hydrogels were washed 6 times with sterile PBS and kept in fibronectin solution ( 20 µ g / mL ; Sigma ) for 1 h at room temperature . 8 Mesenchymal Stem Cell Culture and Seeding . Mesenchymal stem cells ( P3−5 , Promocell ) were cultured in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium 2 ( PromoCell ) . For proliferation assays , MSCs were harvested with Accutase solution ( Promocell , 2 . 5 mL for a T75 flask ) containing 0 . 5 mM EDTA ( PromoCell ) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min . Cells were resuspended in medium at a ratio of 1 : 1 , centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm , counted , and re - suspended in MSC medium at a desired density . Cells were allowed to adhere and proliferate in an incubator ( 37 °C and 5 % CO2 ) for different periods of time ( three , five and seven days of culture ) , prior to staining and imaging . For the isolation of extracellular vesicles , cells were seeded in a 6 - well plate ( in total 8 wells to have a total surface area 75 cm 2 ) . Cells were seeded at a concentration of 250 , 000 cells / well , so that cells were near 70 % confluent after 24 h , when the medium was replaced with serum - free medium ( Thermo Fischer ; StemPro™ MSC SFM , A1033201 ) for 48 h . EVs were isolated at day 3 and the wells were refilled with fresh MSC SFM . The same procedure was repeated at days 5 and 7 of culture . For passaging , cells were re - seeded at a density of 300 , 000 cells per T75 flask . Characterisation of particle sizes and concentrations . To characterise the size and concentration of EVs , nanoparticle tracking analysis ( NTA ) was carried out using a Nanosight LM20 ( Nanosight Technology , Malvern ) . Triplicates of standard measurements ( 60 seconds per measurement ) video captures were carried out ( camera level 16 , detection threshold 5 for all samples ) . The data were analysed using the NTA software version 3 . 2 . EVs size were also characterised by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) . Three samples were measured ( in triplicates each ) per condition , using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS . EV Isolation . For the isolation of EVs , the cell culture medium was changed to serum - free medium for 48 h , when cells were approximately 70 % confluent . The medium was collected from the samples and cleared from cell debris with multiple centrifugation steps at 4⁰C ( 300 x g for 10 minutes followed by 2 , 000 x g for 20 minutes and 10 , 000 x g for 30 minutes ) [ 52 ] . Supernatants were collected , aliquoted and stored at - 80⁰C . EVs were isolated using the ExoCap Streptavidin Kit ( Caltag MedSystems Ltd , MEX - SA ) , following the protocol recommended by the supplier . Briefly , streptavidin magnetic beads were first conjugated with the desired biotinylated antibody ( anti - CD63 , biotin ; Miltenyi Biotec ) and allowed to incubate with the sample stirring overnight , at 4⁰C . Samples were washed 3 times with the washing buffer and the beads were re - suspended in the appropriate buffer for further analysis . 9 EV content characterisation . EVs were isolated on streptavidin magnetic beads as described above and the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fischer , 23225 ) was used to characterise their protein content . The magnetic beads with captured EVs were washed once with cold PBS , and then lysed in RIPA buffer ( Thermo Fischer , 89900 ) on ice for 10 minutes . The samples were mixed several times and kept at the magnetic rack for 1 minute . Supernatant were collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 14 , 000 x g . Supernatants were discarded and the pellet was re - suspended in PBS . BCA solution were added to the samples and kept at 37⁰C for 3 h . The adsorption of the samples were measured at 562 nm with a spectrophotometer . Treatment with disruptors of cytoskeleton assembly . Cell were seeded on the substrate of interest , in 24 - well plates ( at density of 30 , 000 cells per well ) . The inhibitors Y - 27632 ( Sigma ) and Jasplakinolide ( Sigma ) were diluted in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM . Inhibitors solutions were diluted in MSC medium ( at a concentration of 10 μM ) and added to the samples for 4 or 24 h . Samples were then washed once with PBS and fixed for imaging . For the EVs isolation , cells were cultured in 6 - well plates ( at a density of 300 , 000 cells per well ) . After the addition of inhibitor solution , the medium was collected and cleared as described earlier before further analysis . Immuno - fluorescence staining . Samples were washed once with PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . Thereafter , samples were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 5 min at room temperature . After washing with PBS ( three times ) , samples were blocked for 1 h in 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . The blocking buffer was partly removed from the emulsion samples ; not allowing them to be exposed to air , and all samples were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight . Samples were washed six times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibodies in blocking buffer ( BSA 3 % in PBS ; phalloidin , 1 : 500 ; DAPI , 1 : 1000 ; vinculin , 1 : 1000 ; CD63 , 1 : 500 ; CD9 , 1 : 500 ) . After washing with PBS ( six times ) , emulsion samples were transferred to Ibidi wells and gels on coverslips were mounted on glass slides for imaging . The same procedure was followed for the captured EVs on magnetic beads , using the magnetic rack for the washing steps . SYTO RNA Select Green Fluorescent Cell Stain ( Thermo Fischer ) was added to the samples after imaging with the secondary antibodies . An amount of 100 μL of labelling solution ( 500 nM staining solution ) was added to each sample and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature . 10 Immuno - Fluorescence Microscopy and Data Analysis . Confocal microscopy images were acquired with a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope . To determine the cell spreading areas , images ( phalloidin staining of the actin cytoskeleton ) were analyzed by thresholding and watershedding in Fiji ImageJ . A total number of 50 cells per conditions were analysed at day one and three of culture . Transfection assay . MSCs were cultured in 6 - well plates ( 300 , 000 per well ) and in 24 - well plates on coverslips ( 100 , 000 per well ) and allowed to adhere for 24 h . Transfections were carried out with siRNA ( Thermo Fischer , Silencer Select siRNA ) at a concentration of 30 pmol / well . siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Thermofischer , 13778150 ) were diluted separately in OPTI - MEM ( Thermo Fischer , 31985062 ) . The diluted siRNA and the diluted Lipofectamine were then mixed gently in 1 : 1 ratio and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature . The medium from each well was aspirated and washed with PBS and replaced with 400 μL OPTI - MEM . 100 μL of the siRNA - lipid complex were added drop by drop to the cells and mixed gently . The plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h . The medium was aspirated and each well was washed once with PBS before they were refill with MSC medium . The coverslips in the 24 - well plates were fixed and stained for imaging after 24 h . The imaging was carried out with a Leica DMI8 and the transfection efficiency was quantified using Fiji ImageJ . Silencing sequences and controls are as follows , from Thermo Fisher : Silencer™ Select Negative Control ( 4390843 ) and Silencer® Select siRNAs for YBX1 ( siRNA IDs s9732 and s9733 ) and YBX2 ( siRNA IDs s27393 and s27394 ) . Statistical Analysis . Statistical analysis was carried out using OriginPro 9 through one - way ANOVA with Tukey test for posthoc analysis . Significance was determined by * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 and n . s . , non - significant . A full summary of statistical analysis is provided in the supplementary information . 11 Results and Discussion To support the growth of MSCs on scalable bioemulsions , microdroplets stabilised by b - lactoglobulin ( b LG ) were investigated ( Figure 1A ) [ 49 ] . As this protein is not bioactive , at least from the point of view of integrin ligation and the promotion of cell adhesion , the resulting droplets were further functionalised with RGD peptides . Protein nanosheets are required to accomplish a triple role for bioemulsion design , conferring stability owing to their tensioactive properties , cell adhesion through integrin - binding peptides and scaffolding properties , in order to resist cell - mediated forces . It was found that , even in the absence of additional co - surfactants , which had been found critical to regulate the viscoelastic properties of albumin nanosheets , b LG formed comparatively elastic interfaces [ 36 ] . This was confirmed by interfacial rheology ( Figure 1B ) , indicating a rapid increase in interfacial shear storage and loss moduli upon injection of b LG . The two moduli rapidly diverged , with the storage component dominating near 8 - fold over the loss component . After applying a protocol allowing the exchange of the aqueous phase to remove free protein from the solution , the addition of sulfo - SMCC led to a further 3 - fold increase in interfacial shear modulus . These results were further confirmed by frequency sweeps and stress relaxation experiments , which confirmed the formation of stiff elastic interfaces following sulfo - SMCC treatment ( Supplementary Figure S1 - 2 ) . This behaviour suggests that sulfo - SMCC , upon coupling through its activated succinimidyl ester residue , enables further reaction and crosslinking via maleimides . This may be attributed to remaining free cysteines on the b LG proteins , or could be associated with reactivity with remaining lysines and other nucleophiles , via Michael addition . Alternatively , the addition of the relatively hydrophobic cyclohexyl groups may be sufficient to induce physical crosslinking . Beyond enabling bioconjugation with cell adhesive peptides , sulfo - SMCC may therefore also result in the crosslinking of protein nanosheets and strengthening of associated interfacial mechanics . With an ultimate interfacial shear modulus near 100 mN / m , and assuming a thickness near 10 nm [ 36 ] , the equivalent bulk Young ' s modulus of b LG - SMCC interfaces is estimated to be near 30 MPa , significantly above the minimum range of moduli of hydrogels supporting MSC adhesion [ 50 , 53 ] . MSCs were next seeded on the resulting b LG - RGD bioemulsions and cultured for 7 days ( Figures 1A and C ) . The proliferation of these cells was monitored during this time period and compared 12 to that of MSCs adhering to tissue culture plastic ( TCP , Figure 1D ) . MSCs expanded significantly during this time period , both on TCP and b LG - RGD bioemulsions , with expansion rates slightly higher in the former case , although this was not statistically significant . In agreement with the impact of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton assembly on MSC fate and cycling [ 50 , 54 , 55 ] , cells adhering to both TCP and b LG - RGD bioemulsions displayed clear focal adhesions and stress fibres , with a well - structured actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 1E ) . In order to evaluate the output of extra - cellular vesicles ( EVs ) as a function of culture substrate , cells were cultured in cleared medium ( free from debris and vesicles or particulates contained in serum ) , prior to monitoring of particle densities , associated with EV secretion ( Figure 1F ) . A significant increase in EV secretion and accumulation into the culture medium was observed in the case of MSCs cultured on b LG - RGD bioemulsions ( 2 fold compared to TCP ) . In addition , capture by magnetic microparticles and immunostaining confirmed that EVs released were positive for the exosome markers CD63 and CD9 ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . When corrected for differences in cell densities , this corresponds to a 100 % increase , compared to TCP . This increase was associated with increased densities of CD63 + vesicles , in bioemulsion cultures ( Figure 1E ) , without significant change in the size distributions ( Figure 1G ) . Therefore these results suggest that substrate nanoscale mechanics not only impacts on cell adhesion , spreading and proliferation at liquid - liquid interfaces , but also extracellular vesicle production and associated signalling . 13 Figure 1 .

F ) Concentration of EVs secreted by MSCs cultured on TCP and bioemulsion at different time points . G ) Corresponding size profiles at day three of culture . Error bars are s . e . m . ; n = 3 . 14 The significant increase in EV production in bioemulsion cultures is in agreement with growing evidence that a number of physical microenvironment parameters regulate both vesicular membrane activity and extra - cellular vesicle production [ 20 , 22 , 23 ] . The observation that the production of EVs by MSCs was increased at liquid - liquid interfaces raised the possibility that matrix stiffness promoted enhanced EV output by MSCs . To examine the role of matrix compliance on vesicle production , MSCs were cultured on soft ( 2 kPa ) and stiff ( 115 kPa ) poly ( acrylamide ) ( PAAm ) hydrogels functionalised with fibronectin ( Figure 2 ) . Cell adhesion and spreading were significantly impacted by hydrogel stiffness , in agreement with well - established literature [ 50 , 53 ] . 24 h after seeding , whereas cells adhering to 115 kPa PAAm hydrogels displayed a well - structured actin cytoskeleton and mature focal adhesions , MSCs adhering to 2 kPa hydrogels did not ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , although CD63 + vesicles could be clearly observed both on soft and stiff hydrogels , immunostainings microscopy indicated relatively aggregated structures in cells adhering to 2 kPa PAAm gels , whereas they were more homogenously distributed in the case of cells adhering to 115 kPa gels . This observation is likely associated with the significant change in cytoskeleton organisation observed in response to matrix compliance , and associated change in membrane tension , vesicular transport and exocytosis [ 22 , 23 ] . The impact of matrix stiffness on EV production was next investigated , over 7 days of culture . At early time points ( day 3 ) , despite the restricted cell spreading observed on softer hydrogels , the concentrations of EVs released were found to be equivalent on all substrates , although slightly higher on TCP ( Figure 2B ) . However , by day 7 , more significant differences could be seen , with MSCs cultured on 2 kPa PAAm gels displaying significantly fewer EVs compared to cells growing on 115 kPa PAAm gels and TCP . Interestingly , cells growing on bioemulsions displayed higher EV production compared to cells cultured on stiff hydrogels . The sizes of the vesicles secreted were found to be comparable in all conditions , in the range of 130 - 200 nm ( Figure 2C ) . At day 7 , EV production also correlated with the expression and presentation of CD63 + particles , based on fluorescence images ( Figure 2D ) , confirming the particle counts determined . Therefore , the strong nanoscale mechanical environment associated with protein nanosheets assembled at liquid - liquid interfaces was found to dominate cell response to the mechanics of their micro - environment and sustained not only cell spreading , but also promoted enhanced EV production . 15 Figure 2 .

B ) Concentration of EVs secreted from TCP , PAAm hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa ) and bioemulsion on day three , five and seven of culture . C ) Corresponding sizes of secreted EVs . D ) Intensity of CD63 + objects ( total intensity per cell ) presented by cells cultured on TCP , soft and stiff hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa , respectively ) after seven days of culture . Scale bars are 50 μm . Error bars are s . e . m . ; n = 3 . Considering the role played by cytoskeleton assembly and contractility on the regulation of MSC phenotype , migration , cytokine expression and exocytosis , the impact that such processes could have on EV production was next examined . After initial adhesion to TCP and PAAm hydrogels with 2 and 115 kPa Young ' s moduli , MSCs were treated with the Rho kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y27632 and the inhibitor of actin disassembly Jasplakinolide [ 56 ] , followed by 24 h of further culture , immunostaining and imaging ( Figure 3A ) . In line with previous observations , such treatment had a significant impact on cell adhesion and cytoskeleton assembly . In both cases , cell spreading was found to be independent from matrix stiffness , with apparent cytoskeletal disruption ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S4 ) . 16 However , whereas MSCs treated with Y27632 displayed high spreading on all substrates , cell spreading was found to be significantly restricted by Jasplakinolide treatment . Stress fibres were disrupted in cells treated with Y27632 , but large actin clusters were observed for cells treated with Jasplakinolide . In all cases , CD63 + structures could be clearly observed in cells treated with these compounds , irrespective of the substrate on which they were cultured ( Figure 3A ) . The localisation of associated putative CD63 + vesicles was however significantly affected by disruption of the cytoskeleton organisation , with images implying aggregation and clustering , likely reflecting significant perturbation of vesicle transport . In turn , EV production was significantly impacted by actin disruption ( Figure 3C ) . In all cases , EV concentrations measured upon culture in medium supplemented with actin disruptors were nearly 1 order of magnitude lower than upon culture on the same substrate , in the normal culture medium . This reduction was particularly striking in the case of MSCs treated with Jasplakinolide when cultured on 2 kPa PAAm gels . Therefore , these results are consistent with an important impact of cytoskeleton assembly on EV production , likely through combined effects of such disruption on vesicle transport and membrane tension , two processes regulating exocytosis [ 12 , 22 ] . 17 Figure 3 . Actin cytoskeleton disruption impacts on the secretion of EVs . A ) Confocal microscopy images of MSCs cultured on TCP and PAAm hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa ) , treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and Jasplakinolide ( blue , DAPI ; red , phalloidin ; green , vinculin ; magenta , CD63 ) . B ) Changes in cell spreading as a result of Y27632 and Jasplakinolide treatment , after 24 h of culture . C ) Concentration of EVs secreted by MSCs cultured on TCP , PAAm hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa ) and bioemulsions , after 24 h of Y27632 and Jasplakinolide treatment . Scale bars are 50 μm . Error bars are s . e . m . ; n = 3 . 18 The impact of substrate mechanics on extravesicular protein and RNA content was quantified next . After recovery from different culture substrates , EVs were lysed and their total protein content analysed . Although protein contents were found to be relatively equivalent at early time points , differences were more apparent at days 5 and 7 , with protein concentrations overall significantly higher on bioemulsions compared to those harvested from rigid TCP or compliant PAAm hydrogels ( Figure 4A ) . Similarly , RNA content ( quantified via fluorescence microscopy directly capture of EVs by magnetic microparticles ) was also found to be enhanced on bioemulsions ( Figures 4B and C ) . In addition , RNA content was reduced more significantly on softer ( 2 kPa ) PAAm hydrogels . However , when corrected for differences in EV concentrations ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) , these differences did not persist and the estimated protein concentration per EV was found to be comparable , indicating that EV content remained globally unchanged , although total output was affected by matrix stiffness . As micro RNAs are predominant RNAs found in EVs and are packaged within exosomes through interactions with the translational regulator YBox1 [ 14 , 16 , 17 ] , the impact of matrix stiffness on YBox1 - mediated RNA packaging was next examined . To investigate a possible involvement of YBox1 in the matrix - mediated modulation of EV production , immunostaining of YBox1 and YBox2 , another cold - shock protein implicated in the regulation of RNA translation [ 57 ] , but not previously associated with RNA packaging , was examined ( Figure 4D ) . YBox1 was found to be predominantly cytoplasmic , with some nuclear overlap , but presumably reflecting peri - nuclear association , rather than nuclear localisation . In contrast , YBox2 was found to be predominantly nuclear or peri - nuclear . In response to matrix compliance , the pool of YBox1 was significantly depleted in MSCs adhering to 2 kPa PAAm hydrogels , compared to 115 kPa PAAm gels or TCP . In the case of YBox2 , expression levels were also found to be significantly reduced on 2 kPa PAAm hydrogels compared to 115 kPa PAAm or TCP . Therefore the expression level and localisation of YBox proteins 1 and 2 were found to be regulated by matrix compliance , suggesting a potential role of these proteins in the regulation of exocytosis , EV production and RNA packaging by matrix mechanical properties . 19 Figure 4 . Substrate nanoscale mechanics impacts EVs composition . A ) Protein content of EVs isolated EVs from MSCs cultured on TCP , PAAm hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa ) and bioemulsions at day three , five and seven . B ) Quantification of exosomal RNA recovered from corresponding substrates at day 7 . C ) Confocal microscopy images of labelled exosomal RNA from EVs 20 ( captured on magnetic beads ; red , CD63 ; green , RNA ) harvested from on TCP , PAAm hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa ) and bioemulsions . D ) Fluorescence microscopy images of YBox 1 and YBox 2 expression by MSCs cultured on TCP and PAAm hydrogels ( 2 and 115 kPa ) . E ) Confocal microscopy images confirming the knock down of YBox 1 and its impact on the formation of CD63 + vesicles . F ) Corresponding quantification of YBox 1 and CD63 intensities . Scale bars are 50 μm . Error bars are s . e . m . ; n = 3 . In order to investigate the impact of YBox proteins 1 and 2 on EV production , their knock down was implemented , prior to examination of CD63 expression and localisation via immuno - staining ( Figure 4E and Supplementary Figures S6 and S7 ) . The expression of both proteins was reduced by 80 - 90 % using two independent siRNA targets ( see methods for details ) . However , whereas this led to a clear reduction in CD63 + staining intensity in YBox1 knock down , compared to non - targeting controls ( Figure 4E ) , YBox2 knock down had a more modest impact on CD63 expression or apparent localisation ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Therefore , these data suggest that , in addition to the regulation of exocytosis via membrane tension , matrix compliance may also regulate YBox1 expression and localisation and in turn EV production and RNA packaging . Conclusions Exosomes and EVs are increasingly considered as a viable cell - free strategy for regenerative medicine , but require development of manufacturing pipelines in order to cope with the throughput associated with the safe translation of these technologies . The significant enhancement of EV production on bioemulsions may contribute to bring these complex therapeutics closer to the clinic , in a scalable , easily processable and safe format . Beyond the selection of oils , proteins and co - surfactants that may be applied for the design of bioemulsion platforms , the understanding of the impact of nanoscale mechanics on MSC secretory phenotype , EV release and packaging of associated biotherapeutics will be essential to optimise the performance of these systems . Combined with state - of - the - art strategies for cell engineering and expression of defined biotherapeutics , bioemulsions may help to bring precise therapeutics design and production closer to translation . 21 This report also further demonstrate the important role that local , nanoscale , mechanics plays for the regulation of cell phenotype . Despite the low viscosity of the oil used in this study , the nanoscale mechanics of protein nanosheet interfaces was found to support cell spreading , proliferation and to enhance EV production . Hence , whereas PAAm hydrogel compliance significantly reduced EV outputs , protein nanosheet - stabilised microdroplets promoted higher levels of secretion compared to relatively stiff hydrogels and rigid TCP . In this respect , the role of nanoscale mechanics on the regulation of exocytosis and RNA / protein packaging within EVs remains unclear . However , this report proposes that YBox1 expression and sub - cellular localisation is regulated by matrix compliance and controls the packaging of EVs and potentially RNA cargos . Although the precise molecular mechanism via which such process could be regulated remains to be established , the potential synergy with membrane tension - mediated exocytic control may underpin overall EV production and therapeutic packaging . We could not observe any correlation between the actin cytoskeleton and YBox1 localisation , despite reports suggesting potential association of related P50 with actin [ 58 ] . Proteins regulating focal adhesion or cytoskeleton assembly , such as zyxin which was reported to associate with Ybox1 to modulate downstream translation of RXR g mRNA [ 59 ] , could also regulate EV packaging . Elucidating the detail of these mechanisms could prove particularly important to further design biomaterials for EV production , as well as to understand how microenvironmental factors may mediate pathological scenarios through EV signalling .
