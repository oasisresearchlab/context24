A R T I C L E S Although enzyme active sites are commonly targeted by inhibitor screens in pharmaceutical laboratories , in nature , protein function is often regulated through allostery ; the binding of a small molecule to one site regulates the activity of another site on the protein 1 . Allosteric regulators are thought to act by altering a conformational equilibrium of the protein between active and inactive states . Such equilibria can also be targeted by non - natural small molecules that perturb these conformational transitions . In addition to providing alternative avenues for inhibiting enzymes , this approach could , in principle , allow targeting of allosterically regulated proteins that lack catalytic sites or small molecule – binding sites . Indeed , many clinically impor - tant signaling pathways are mediated by proteins lacking catalytic activity that serve instead as scaffolding , structural or regulatory com - ponents . In some cases activation of these proteins involves structural rearrangements . It is unknown how readily small molecule inhibitors can be found for proteins not allosterically regulated by small mole - cules in vivo . To identify the components of a signaling pathway regulating the actin cytoskeleton that are most vulnerable to small molecule inhibi - tion , we conducted a forward chemical genetic screen of a pathway mediating actin filament nucleation , a process that has important roles in cell motility , membrane trafficking and the movement of some intracellular pathogens . Forward screens , in contrast to traditional , target - driven drug discovery programs , allow the identification of inhibitors that act on any component mediating the pathway of interest 2 . These unbiased screens allow the biology of the pathway to reveal its most susceptible components , although one must subsequently identify the molecular target of the inhibitor . We and others have described a signaling pathway by which the phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) and the small GTPase Cdc42 induce actin polymerization through the action of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex , a 220 - kDa protein complex and a major cellular actin filament nucleator 3 – 7 . This pathway has been reconstituted in cell extracts and can be adapted for high - throughput screening of compound libraries 6 . N - WASP activation of Arp2 / 3 complex is medi - ated by a C - terminal element of N - WASP termed the VCA region ( named for homology with verprolin , a central hydrophobic segment and a stretch of acidic residues ; Fig . 1a ) . The different portions of the VCA play distinct roles in the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex : the V region recruits actin monomer , the C region mediates an activation step that probably involves conformational change of the assembly and the A region mediates high - affinity binding to Arp2 / 3 complex 8 . VCA activity is negatively regulated by intramolecular binding to the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) of the protein , which acts in part to sequester the C region from Arp2 / 3 complex 9 . Binding of Cdc42 to the GBD destabilizes the autoinhibitory interactions between the GBD and VCA , promoting the active conformation and leading to VCA - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 1b ) . Here we report the identification of wiskostatin , a small molecule that inhibits activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by N - WASP .

Autoregulatory domains represent attractive alternative targets for small molecule inhibitors because they also occur in noncatalytic proteins and because allosteric inhibitors may avoid specificity problems inherent in active site – directed inhibitors . We report here the identification of wiskostatin , a chemical inhibitor of the neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) . Wiskostatin interacts with a cleft in the regulatory GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) of WASP in the solution structure of the complex . Wiskostatin induces folding of the isolated , unstructured GBD into its autoinhibited conformation , suggesting that wiskostatin functions by stabilizing N - WASP in its autoinhibited state . The use of small molecules to bias conformational equilibria represents a potentially general strategy for chemical inhibition of autoinhibited proteins , even in cases where such sites have not been naturally evolved in a target .

The isolated WASP GBD is unfolded in solution but binding of wiskostatin causes the domain to fold into its natural autoinhibited conformation . This suggests that wiskostatin inhibits N - WASP by stabilizing the native autoinhibitory interaction between the GBD and VCA domains . Thus wiskostatin can be considered to act by biasing an allosteric equilibrium toward an inactive state . These results suggest that even in allosteric sys - tems not known to be regulated by small molecules , inhibitory com - pounds that act on the allosteric equilibrium may be discovered through appropriate screens . In addition , the expanding number of sig - naling proteins known to be regulated by autoinhibitory domains may be a hitherto underexploited class of potential drug targets . RESULTSScreening and identification of wiskostatin Cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs were supplemented with pyrene - labeled actin monomers in order to monitor actin polymeriza - tion using a fluorescence readout . The extract was aliquotted into 384 - well plates and individual library compounds were added to each well . On addition of PIP 2 , control wells assemble actin and the incorpora - tion of pyrene - actin into filaments results in a marked increase in pyrene fluorescence 5 , 6 . Polymer mass , and correspondingly fluores - cence , increases until a new steady state is reached ( Fig . 2a , DMSO curve ) . Polymerization rate at each time point can be calculated as the slope of the fluorescence curve over a defined time interval , determined by linear interpolation . Maximum polymerization rates are obtained by sliding this time window through the entire time course . We screened a 16 , 320 - member library ( Chembridge , DiverSet E ) of diverse small molecules for their ability to prevent net polymerization of actin in response to PIP 2 . Among the most potent inhibitors identified was a family of halogenated carbazole derivatives , the most potent of which we called wiskostatin , for reasons described below ( Fig . 2b ) . Wiskostatin is a dibrominated carbazole that is N - alkylated with a side chain containing a chiral hydroxyl group and a terminal tertiary amine . Wiskostatin inhibited actin assembly in response to PIP 2 in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2a ) . An EC 50 of ∼ 4 µ M was calculated as the dose of compound required to inhibit the maximal actin polymeriza - tion rate to 50 % of the maximal polymerization rate of control reac - tions . Analysis of the activity of structurally related chemicals present in the library revealed several structural elements important for activity . A derivative of wiskostatin substituting chlorides for the bromides on the carbazole ring ( compare wiskostatin and compound 2 , Fig . 2b ) retained activity although with slightly reduced potency . A nonhalogenated derivative ( compound 3 ) , however , was > 50 - fold less active , indicating the importance of these atoms to wiskostatin activity .

Because the wiskostatin used in the screen is a racemic mixture , we wished to determine whether the enantiomers were equally potent . We therefore designed a stereoselective synthesis of the R and S enantiomers ( Supplementary Methods online ) . Notably , dose - response experiments revealed a similar potency of both enantiomers at inhibiting PIP 2 - induced actin assembly ( Fig . 2b ) . Identification of the target of wiskostatin Cdc42 , N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex are all required for PIP 2 - induced actin assembly in cytoplasmic extracts 4 , 5 , 7 . In its GTP - bound state , Cdc42 binds directly to the GBD of N - WASP , relieving N - WASP autoinhibition and allowing it to activate Arp2 / 3 com - plex 10 , 11 . On binding to active N - WASP and the side of an existing actin filament , Arp2 / 3 complex is thought to directly nucleate poly - merization of a new actin filament , which it anchors to the ‘mother’ filament 12 . To deter - mine whether wiskostatin inhibited any one of these components , we tested its inhibitory activity in pyrene - actin polymerization assays conducted with purified proteins . First we monitored the spontaneous poly - merization rate of pure actin in the presence of physiological salts and ATP ( Fig . 3a ) . Concentrations of wiskostatin > 20 µ M par - tially inhibited the polymerization of actin . Much higher doses were required to inhibit the maximum rate of actin polymerization by 50 % ( IC 50 = ∼ 140 µ M ( S ) - wiskostatin ( Fig . 3a ) , ∼ 180 µ M ( R ) - wiskostatin ; data not shown ) . Because only 4 – 5 µ M wiskostatin was required to inhibit the rate of actin assembly in the cytoplasmic extracts by 50 % , we concluded that in extract wiskostatin may also target another component of the pathway . We next tested for inhibition of the actin filament nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 com - plex using purified proteins . We chose to use 10 µ M wiskostatin in these experiments because at this dose wiskostatin does not directly affect actin ( Fig . 3a , b ) but still inhibits the PIP 2 - dependent actin assembly pathway in cytoplasmic extract . In the pres - ence of Arp2 / 3 complex and its activator , the VCA segment of N - WASP , the kinetics of actin assembly are greatly enhanced relative to the kinetics of actin alone ( Fig . 3b ) , indi - cating that VCA can activate Arp2 / 3 complex . Wiskostatin did not affect this enhancement even at relatively low concentrations of the VCA activator ( Fig . 3b ; R stereoisomer not shown ) . We therefore concluded that wisko - statin does not target Arp2 / 3 complex , nor the isolated VCA domain . Full - length N - WASP only weakly enhances ( less than two - fold ) the activity of Arp2 / 3 complex in the pyrene - actin polymerization assays compared with the VCA peptide , owing to the autoinhibitory regulation of the full - length protein 7 . In the presence of 10 µ M wisko - statin ( either enantiomer ) , however , the N - WASP - enhanced actin assembly kinetics were substantially inhibited ( Fig . 3c ( S ) - wiskostatin ; NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 11 NUMBER 8 AUGUST 2004 749 Figure 3 Wiskostatin targets N - WASP . ( a ) Wiskostatin directly inhibits actin polymerization only at high concentrations . Pyrene - actin polymerization kinetics are shown for several concentrations of ( S ) - wiskostatin or DMSO ( compound vehicle ) . The IC 50 for inhibition of actin polymerization by wiskostatin is 140 µ M . ( b ) 10 µ M wiskostatin does not inhibit actin polymerization or activity of Arp2 / 3 complex . The fluorescence increase accompanying pyrene - actin polymerization was monitored in the presence of purified preparations of the indicated proteins : actin ( 1 . 5 µ M ) , Arp2 / 3 complex ( 60 nM ) and GST - VCA ( 80 nM ) . Control reactions received DMSO instead of 10 µ M wiskostatin . ( c ) Wiskostatin , but not control compounds , inhibits N - WASP basal activity . N - WASP stimulation of activity of Arp2 / 3 complex ( compare Actin + Arp2 / 3 ± N - WASP ) was tested in the presence of the indicated compounds . Purified actin assembly reactions were conducted as in b except that all reactions other than actin + Arp2 / 3 also contained recombinant , full - length N - WASP ( 400 nM ) . Reactions not receiving compound were supplemented with an equivalent volume of DMSO . ( d ) Wiskostatin is a competitive inhibitor of Cdc42 - and PIP 2 - mediated activation of N - WASP . N - WASP ( 90 nM ) was activated by the inclusion of Cdc42 ( 500 nM ) and liposomes containing PIP 2 ( 10 µ M total lipids ) ( 1 × reactions ) in the presence or absence of 10 µ M ( S ) - wiskostatin as indicated . Where indicated , two - fold ( 2 × ) and four - fold ( 4 × ) higher amounts of Cdc42 and PIP 2 - containing liposomes were included . ( e ) Quantification of reactions in d .

Actin polymerization exhibits an initial ‘lag phase’ during which trimeric actin nuclei form , followed by an elonga - tion phase in which growth from actin nuclei produces maximal increases in polymer mass . This growth rate is determined by the con - centration of monomeric actin and the number of free , elongating fil - ament ends 13 . Because 10 µ M wiskostatin does not affect the concentration of actin monomer ( Fig . 3a , b ) , its effect on the polymer - ization rate must be due to decreasing the number of filament ends . This number is directly related to the number of nucleating Arp2 / 3 complexes and therefore active N - WASP molecules . Thus , the poly - merization rate is directly related to N - WASP activity . Notably , wisko - statin increased the length of the lag phase relative to the kinetics of actin and Arp2 / 3 complex in the absence of N - WASP ( producing a more pronounced sigmoidal curve shape ; compare green triangles with blue squares in Fig . 3c ) . This is most likely due to the ability of inhibited N - WASP to still bind to monomeric actin 10 , reducing the concentration of free actin monomer and consequently increasing the time required to form trimeric actin nuclei during lag phase . Direct inhibition of actin itself at higher doses of wiskostatin ( Fig . 3a ) complicated an IC 50 determination for wiskostatin inhibition of N - WASP in the pyrene - actin assay . Nevertheless , N - WASP activity can be attributed to the increase in maximal polymerization rate from reac - tions with ( blue squares , Fig . 3c ) and without N - WASP ( black circles , Fig . 3c ) . If we define the maximal polymerization rate ( maximum slope of the pyrene fluorescence curve ) of a reaction lacking N - WASP as 100 % inhibition and the maximal slope of a reaction containing N - WASP as 0 % inhibition , 10 µ M wiskostatin inhibited N - WASP activity by 60 % . Thus the IC 50 for N - WASP inhibition in the purified protein assay is probably slightly < 10 µ M , similar to wiskostatin’s potency in extract , within experimental error . The control compounds 4 ( Fig . 3c ) , 3 , and 5 ( data not shown ) were inactive at a similar concentration . Because 10 µ M wiskostatin does not inhibit the assembly of pure actin or the activity of VCA - stimulated Arp2 / 3 complex , these results strongly sug - gest that N - WASP is the target of the small molecule . For this reason we chose the name ‘wiskostatin , ’ based on the ability of the compound to inhibit a member of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein family . Although basal N - WASP activity is weak , its activity is markedly stimulated by binding to both Cdc42 and PIP 2 ( refs . 7 , 10 ) . To test if wiskostatin would inhibit N - WASP activation by these molecules , we conducted purified protein pyrene - actin polymerization assays in vitro in the presence or absence of wiskostatin and the activators . Indeed , wiskostatin suppressed N - WASP activation by Cdc42 bound to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTP γ S and liposomes contain - ing PIP 2 ( Fig . 3d , e ; compare + 1 × Cdc42 / PIP 2 ± ( S ) - wisk ) . Notably , this suppression was reversed by the addition of increasing amounts of Cdc42 and PIP 2 ( Fig . 3d , e ; + 2 × and + 4 × Cdc42 / PIP 2 ) , indicating competitive activities of the activators and wiskostatin with respect to N - WASP . Structure of wiskostatin bound to WASP The structural and regulatory properties of N - WASP are virtually identical to those of its hematopoietic cell – specific homolog , WASP . The two proteins are 46 % identical throughout their lengths , and are 68 % identical in their autoinhibitory cores ( GBD and C elements ) . In both cases , the GBD and VCA bind each other in trans with ∼ 1 µ M affinity , and the GBD can be displaced from the VCA by addition of Cdc42 ( refs . 11 , 14 ) . Moreover , NMR data indicate that both GBDs lack tertiary structure in isolation , but fold to a defined conformation on addition of their respective VCA elements 11 , 15 . Finally , many bio - logical functions of WASP and N - WASP overlap 16 . 750 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 8 AUGUST 2004 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Figure 4 The solution structure of wiskostatin bound to mini - WASP .

Thus , to elucidate the mechanism of wisko - statin inhibition , we investigated the interaction of the compound with a truncated form of WASP by NMR . We previously solved the structure of the autoinhibited core of WASP ( referred to here as mini - WASP , Fig . 1 ) , which consists of the GBD bound through a short linker to the central hydrophobic region of the VCA element 11 . This structure is composed of a small domain that can be considered in three layers . The first layer ( yellow in Fig . 4 ) consists of the β - hairpin and α 1 helix , which are the minimal elements necessary to bind Cdc42 with high affinity 11 . The second layer ( blue in Fig . 4 ) consists of helices α 2 – α 4 and contains the remainder of the GBD . Layer 3 ( red in Fig . 4 ) consists of a single helix , α 5 , formed by the central region of the VCA . Because the regions comprising mini - WASP are ∼ 70 % identical in WASP and N - WASP , we considered it likely that wiskostatin would also interact with WASP . Indeed , titration of wiskostatin into a solution of mini - WASP resulted in discrete and saturable changes in the amide proton chemical shifts of a limited number of residues in layers 1 and 2 of the GBD ( Fig . 4a ) . Notably , amides in layer 3 were largely unchanged in the titration , indicating that the C region , required for Arp2 / 3 complex activation , probably does not contact wiskostatin directly . To better understand the interactions between wiskostatin and WASP , we determined the solution structure of mini - WASP bound to the S enantiomer of the small molecule using NMR ( Fig . 4b , c ) . The complex is well defined by the NMR data for residues 250 – 309 and 464 – 478 of the protein and for wiskostatin , with r . m . s . deviations of 0 . 54 ± 0 . 11 Å from the average coordinates for the backbone and 1 . 08 ± 0 . 12 Å for all heavy atoms in the 20 final lowest - energy structures ( Table 1 ) . The structure of mini - WASP changes lit - tle upon binding to wiskostatin , with a backbone r . m . s . deviation of 1 . 51 Å between the free and bound average coordinates for residues 250 – 309 and 464 – 478 . The largest structural differences are seen in the β - hairpin , consistent with the relatively large backbone amide chemical shift changes in this region upon binding ( Fig . 4a ) . When these residues are removed from the analysis , the backbone r . m . s . deviation drops to 1 . 01 Å . Thirty intermolecular NOEs were observed between seven mini - WASP residues and the carbazole ring system of wiskostatin , localizing it to a shallow hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the GBD at the interface of layers 1 and 2 ( Fig . 4b , c ) . The distribution of intermolecular NOEs and the calculated struc - tures are in good agreement with the chemical shift perturbation data ( Fig . 4a ) ; for example , the most - shifted amide proton , that of Leu300 , is oriented directly into the face of the aromatic carbazole ring system . Indeed , no NOEs between the protein and small mole - cule were observed at other sites in the protein , consistent with a sin - gle wiskostatin - binding site . The structure suggests explanations for some of the observed struc - ture - activity relationships of the wiskostatin family . The brominated carbazole is buried in a hydrophobic pocket on the GBD surface ( Fig . 4b , c ) that requires little rearrangement to accommodate the lig - and . The nonhalogenated derivative , compound 3 , would be substan - tially smaller and therefore unable to interact with the pocket in the same manner ( Fig . 2b ) .

The tertiary amine , which is presumably protonated at neutral pH , may be stabilized by the locally negative surface charge contributed by Asp292 , Glu295 and Glu301 . Otherwise , the amine and hydroxyl may simply promote compound solubility and provide a hydrophilic face that is exposed to solvent , consistent with the lack of discrimination between wiskostatin enantiomers ( Fig . 2b ) . Of the 15 residues within 4 . 5 Å of wiskostatin in the complex , 14 are identical between WASP and N - WASP , indicating that interactions of the small molecule are likely to be highly similar in the two proteins . Conformational stabilization of the GBD The binding site of wiskostatin is wholly contained within the GBD ( amino acids 230 – 310 ; yellow and blue in Fig . 4 ) , a conformationally plastic element of WASP . Isolated GBD peptides are largely unstruc - tured in aqueous buffers . But in the presence of VCA or the structure - stabilizing cosolvent trifluoroethanol ( TFE ) , the GBD folds into its ‘autoinhibited conformation’ in which the β - hairpin and α 1 helix pack against a platform provided by helices α 2 – 4 ( ref . 11 ) . In this con - formation the GBD binds the C region of the VCA and blocks activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex . Extraction of the VCA from the autoinhibited GBD - VCA domain , which is necessary for stimulatory binding to Arp2 / 3 complex 19 , must then cause unfolding of the GBD 8 , 9 . Consistent with an inverse correlation between GBD folding and WASP activity , binding to Cdc42 causes global destabilization of the GBD - VCA domain of WASP , leading to enhanced stimulation of Arp2 / 3 complex 17 , 18 . Thus the conformational plasticity of the GBD , and in particular its equilibrium between folded and largely unfolded states , underlies the activation of WASP . The finding that wiskostatin binds mini - WASP between the β - hairpin and α 3 suggested that the small molecule might stabilize the autoinhibited conformation of the GBD . To test this idea , we monitored interactions between the isolated GBD and wiskostatin by NMR . The free GBD shows poorly dispersed 1 H - 15 N - and 1 H - 13 C - HSQC spectra , characteristic of polypeptides lacking persistent tertiary structure ( Fig . 5a ) . Addition of wiskostatin to a 100 µ M solu - tion of free GBD caused a progressive and marked increase in chem - ical shift dispersion which saturated at ∼ 600 µ M wiskostatin ( Fig . 5b ) . Notably , the final spectrum showed many characteristics of the folded GBD in the presence of a VCA peptide ( Fig . 5c ) . In partic - ular , the VCA peptide induces large upfield changes in the chemical shift of the indole NH of the Trp252 side chain and of the δ 2 methyl proton of Leu281 ( – 0 . 46 p . p . m . and – 0 . 64 p . p . m . , respectively ) owing to packing of these elements against aromatic side chains in distinct locations of the hydrophobic core of the GBD . Very similar changes are also induced by wiskostatin ( arrow shows upfield shifted methyl resonance in the inset panels of Figs . 5a – c ; Trp252 ( not shown ) and Leu281 resonances were tentatively assigned from their distinct chemical shifts by comparison to mini - WASP spectra ) . These characteristic changes , along with other more general similar - ities between the spectra ( circled regions in Fig . 5b , c ) strongly sug - gest that wiskostatin induces folding of the GBD to the autoinhibited conformation . The chemical shifts of the Trp252 side chain NH and Leu281 δ 2 methyl group during the wiskostatin titration can be fit well to a single - site binding isotherm , yielding K d , app values of 112 and 88 µ M , respectively ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Conversely , we also used 13 C - filtered NMR to monitor the chemical shifts of the three aromatic resonances of wisko - statin during a titration with 15 N - 13 C - labeled GBD . Simultaneously fitting these data yielded a similar average K d , app value of 30 µ M ( data not shown ) . Coincidence of the affinity values measured for the Trp252 side chain NH and Leu281 δ 2 methyl group , coupled with the distant location of these residues in the core of the mini - WASP domain ( HN - H 3 C distance of 9 Å ) further supports the notion that the structural change induced by wiskostatin is a global folding event . The discrepancy between the affinity of the wiskostatin - GBD interac - tion determined here and the inhibitory potency of wiskostatin in the functional assays is not unexpected and probably reflects several key differences between the proteins used in each experiment . Most notably , native N - WASP is autoinhibited with a structured GBD - VCA core , whereas the GBD is an unstructured peptide that folds only on binding various partners . In addition , wiskostatin may simply have slightly different affinities for N - WASP and WASP . Notably , the inactive but structurally similar control compound 3 did not induce folding of the GBD even at concentrations several - fold higher than the saturating concentration for wiskostatin ( Fig . 5d , e ) . The nonspecific folding induced by TFE differs from wiskostatin - induced folding in that other structurally distinct alcoholic solvents such as methanol and isopropanol also induce folding . Furthermore , GBD folding induced by these cosolvents occurs only at concentra - tions vastly higher than that necessary for wiskostatin ( for TFE , 10 % or 1 . 4 M ) 11 . Wiskostatin - induced folding of GBD is therefore probably mediated by specific binding . Furthermore , the correspondence between the relative activities of wiskostatin and compound 3 in the actin polymerization assay correspond to their abilities to induce GBD folding . This suggests that the latter property is important to inhibitory function . The observation that wiskostatin promotes folding of the WASP GBD into the autoinhibited conformation suggests a potential mecha - nism for inhibition by the compound . The GBD - VCA core of WASP exists in an equilibrium between a folded , autoinhibited state where the GBD is bound to the VCA , and an unfolded active state where the GBD and VCA are dissociated and largely disordered . Binding of Cdc42 strongly biases the equilibrium toward the active state through interactions of the GTPase with the β - hairpin and α 1 helix of layer 1 of the GBD . Conversely , by stabilizing the folded conformation of the GBD , wiskostatin should enhance its interactions with the VCA , shift - ing the equilibrium toward autoinhibition . This effect would both decrease the activity of WASP alone and antagonize activation by Cdc42 and PIP 2 as observed experimentally ( Fig . 3c – e ) . DISCUSSION The energetics of GBD folding and its binding affinities for activators and VCA have coevolved to create a highly responsive regulatory cir - cuit in which multiple signaling inputs are integrated to regulate the output—activation of Arp2 / 3 complex 16 . For example , N - WASP is extremely sensitive to the concentration of its activators Cdc42 and PIP 2 , which have been shown to activate N - WASP in a steeply cooper - ative manner 7 , 20 . In addition , several SH3 domain – containing pro - teins such as Nck and Grb2 have also been shown to activate N - WASP by binding the proline - rich region of N - WASP that links the GBD and VCA segments 21 – 23 . Nck activation is cooperative with respect to PIP 2 but not Cdc42 ( ref . 21 ) , demonstrating the complex nature of the acti - vation process that must be translated into release of the VCA . In addi - tion to regulation by noncovalent interactors , phosphorylation of N - WASP can contribute to modulating activity 15 , 24 , 25 . Moreover , phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of N - WASP at Tyr256 and WASP at Tyr291 , can only occur efficiently when the GBD is destabi - lized through binding of Cdc42 ( ref . 15 ) or in the presence of PIP 2 ( ref . 25 ) . Thus , the conformational equilibrium of the GBD plays a 752 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 8 AUGUST 2004 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t s t r u c t m o l b i o l A R T I C L E S primary role in determining the activity of N - WASP and WASP . Through this equilibrium , WASP family proteins can integrate multi - ple activators and create both graded and switch - like responses depending on the nature , concentrations and timing of the inputs 15 , 26 . To achieve such responsiveness , the thermodynamics of WASP must be precisely tuned , and the structure must be accessible to a large variety of binding interactions . We have now identified two non - natural , structurally unrelated molecules , wiskostatin and the cyclic peptide 187 - 1 ( ref . 6 ) , that seem to take advantage of the plasticity of the GBD and the energetic bal - ance in WASP to mediate inhibition . Although 187 - 1 also seems to stabilize the GBD - VCA interaction , it is unknown whether it accom - plishes this solely by interacting with the GBD , as wiskostatin does , or by interacting with both domains . Structural investigation of the interaction between 187 - 1 and WASP will be required to determine if the mechanism of wiskostatin is unique or if the conformationally plastic GBD can bind diverse small ligands . Nevertheless , the identifi - cation of two inhibitors that stabilize the inhibitory interaction sug - gests that perturbation of equilibria between alternate conformational states by small molecules represents a successful alternative strategy for chemical inhibition of protein activity . Relatively small changes in these equilibria may produce biologically significant perturbations in signal output . As illustrated here by wiskostatin , a finely tuned confor - mational equilibrium that has been harnessed biologically as an important locus of cellular control can also be exploited by chemical inhibitors that perturb this equilibrium . It is currently unknown whether the inhibitory mechanism used by wiskostatin mimics negative regulatory interactions with endoge - nous small molecules or proteins , although the basal activity of recombinant N - WASP is , indeed , suppressed when added to cyto - plasmic extracts , suggesting the presence of an endogenous inhibitory activity ( J . R . P . and M . W . K . , unpublished observation ) . Such an inhibitor could act similarly to wiskostatin or through an entirely different structural mechanism to achieve the same thermo - dynamic end . Thus , this work suggests that even in cases where small molecule allosteric sites have not yet been discovered , and perhaps have not been utilized by nature , they can be identified using inhibitor screens of this type . Autoinhibition is increasingly recognized as a major regulatory mechanism of protein activity . Over 30 proteins have been described that use cis - inhibitory domains to regulate catalytic or interaction domains 27 , 28 . Many of these lie at the convergence of multiple signaling pathways and / or gate the activity of major responses ( for example , Jak , Abl , p53 and EGFR ) suggesting that conforma - tional plasticity is an important evolutionary solution to the regula - tion of signaling networks . Because the energy landscapes of autoinhibited proteins exhibit multiple , functionally distinct species in equilibrium , they may be particularly amenable to allosteric mod - ulation by chemical compounds . Thus , proteins regulated by confor - mational equilibria may represent a fruitful new type of small molecule target class particularly suited to allosteric inhibition . Such a strategy may afford greater target specificity than one directed toward highly conserved active sites 1 , 29 . Small molecule inhibitors that act on regulatory equilibria as opposed to active sites in signaling proteins could potentially avoid this issue and expand the repertoire of proteins considered as drug targets 30 . Indeed , other examples of protein conformations stabilized by inhibitor interactions have recently emerged . Gleevec ( also imatinib , STI – 571 ) , a potent and clinically important inhibitor of the Abelson tyrosine kinase , stabilizes a natural , autoinhibitory conformation of the Abl activation loop 29 . Similarly , compounds stabilizing the active , wild - type conformations of two other medically relevant proteins , p53 and transthyretin , have been reported 31 , 32 . Further work will be required to establish the general susceptibility of protein conforma - tional equilibria to small molecule perturbation as a means of modu - lating macromolecular function . METHODS High - throughput screening . The high - throughput screen for compounds inhibiting PIP 2 - induced actin assembly in cytoplasm has been described 6 . Purchased compounds ( Chembridge ) were stored in DMSO at < 0 °C . The identity and purity of the compounds were confirmed by HPLC , mass spec - trometry and , when necessary , NMR . All compounds were > 95 % pure . Dose - response experiments in cytoplasmic extract . Xenopus laevis egg extract was prepared , supplemented with 2 µ M pyrene actin as described 6 and DMSO or 100 × compound stock was added . Actin assembly was initiated by adding liposomes ( 10 µ M ( final concentration ) of PIP 2 / phosphatidyl - choline / phosphatidylinositol , 4 : 48 : 48 molar ratio ) and measured the increase in pyrene fluorescence at 386 nm ( 347 - nm excitation ) in a fluorometer ( Varian ) maintained at 22 °C . Maximum actin assembly rates were deter - mined from the slope of the pyrene fluorescence curve by linear interpolation within a ∼ 30 - s sliding window across the first 6 min of the reaction . Reactions containing compound 3 were monitored at 415 nm owing to fluorescence of the compound ( and were compared to control reactions also monitored at 415 nm ) and a ∼ 110 - s sliding time window was used . Maximum slopes from triplicate samples were averaged and plotted as a function of concentration of compound . The dose of compound required to inhibit the polymerization rate to 50 % of the maximum rate of the control reaction was calculated from a sigmoidal curve fitted to the dose - response data . This value is termed half - maximal effective concentration ( EC 50 ) because more than one target may be inhibited in this reaction .

Purified actin polymerization dose - response experiments were conducted by aliquotting 20 µ l of 3 µ M monomeric rabbit muscle actin ( purified and pyrene - labeled as described 6 , 10 % pyrene - labeled ) in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) into individual wells of a 384 - well plate . DMSO ( 0 . 3 µ l ) or 100 × com - pound stock was added and polymerization was initiated by adding 10 µ l of 3 × CSF - XB ( 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 7 , 0 . 3 M KCl , 0 . 3 mM CaCl 2 , 6 mM MgCl 2 , 15 mM EGTA ) . Four replicates were prepared for each compound concentra - tion . Pyrene fluorescence kinetics were monitored using a Victor multilabel plate counter at room temperature . Maximum actin polymerization rates were determined over the first 38 min of polymerization from the slope of the pyrene - actin fluorescence curve by linear interpolation within a ∼ 13 - min sliding window . The dose of compound required to inhibit the polymerization rate to 50 % of the maximum rate of the control reaction was calculated from a sigmoidal curve fitted to the dose - response data . This value is termed half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) because it specifically measures direct inhibition of actin . For the experiments in Figures 3b – e , 80 - µ l reactions were prepared in CSF - XB containing ( as indicated ) 10 µ M PIP 2 - containing liposomes ( 4 : 48 : 48 PIP 2 / phosphatidylcholine / phosphatidylinositol ) , Cdc42 ( 500 nM ) , N - WASP ( 100 or 400 nM ) and Arp2 / 3 complex ( 60 nM ) . Liposomes were prepared by mixing chloroform stocks of individual lipids ( from Avanti Polar Lipids , except PIP 2 , obtained from Calbiochem ) , drying under nitrogen gas and vacuum , resuspending in lipid buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 7 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 50 mM sucrose , 5 mM EGTA ) and extruding through a 0 . 1 - µ m pore size filter ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . Cdc42 was expressed as a GST - fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified , thrombin - cleaved and charged with GTP γ S essentially as described 5 . Full - length rat N - WASP was expressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described 7 . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from a 35 – 65 % ( w / v ) ammonium sulfate cut of bovine brain cytosol by cation - exchange chromatography ( SP Sepharose ; Pharmacia ) followed by affinity chromatography on a GST - CA col - umn ( N - WASP C - terminal region ) followed by ammonium sulfate precipita - tion ( 65 % ) and gel filtration chromatography ( Superdex 200 ; Pharmacia ) . Reactions were initiated by the addition of rabbit muscle actin ( 1 . 5 µ M , 10 % pyrene - labeled ) . Control reactions received DMSO ( solvent ) . Fluorescence was measured at 386 nm ( 347 - nm excitation ) in a fluorometer ( Varian ) at 22 °C and maximum polymerization rates were determined from the slope of the pyrene - actin fluorescence curve by linear interpolation within a sliding window of 70 – 100 s . NMR spectroscopy . NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer . Proteins were expressed and purified as described 11 . Samples contained 1 mM 13 C - 15 N - labeled mini - WASP and 1 mM wiskostatin in 20 mM d 3 - acetate , pH 5 . 0 , 20 mM NaCl , 1 mM d 10 - DTT , and 5 % d 6 - DMSO ( 90 % H 2 O / 10 % D 2 O or 100 % D 2 O ) . Backbone amides were assigned through titration of wiskostatin into mini - WASP . Side chain chemical shift assignments were made by analysis of CCC - TOCSY - NNH , HCC - TOCSY - NNH 33 and HCCH - TOCSY 34 experiments , and by comparison to spectra of free protein . Chemical shifts were quite similar between free and bound protein except in proximity to the wiskostatin binding site , suggesting that the overall structure of WASP is generally unperturbed by wiskostatin . Distance restraints were obtained from the following NOESY experiments ( with indicated mixing times ) : 3D 15 N - edited NOESY ( 60 ms ) , 3D 13 C - edited NOESY ( 60 ms ) , 3D 13 C - edited aromatic NOESY ( 75 ms ) , 4D 13 C / 13 C - edited NOESY ( 100 ms ) , and 4D 13 C / 15 N - edited NOESY ( 100 ms ) . Thirty inter - molecular WASP - wiskostatin NOEs were obtained from a 3D 13 C - edited , 12 C - filtered NOESY experiment with 100 - ms mixing time , and classified as strong ( 1 . 8 – 3 Å ) , medium ( 1 . 8 – 4 Å ) , or weak ( 1 . 8 – 5 Å ) based on intensity . A total of 69 φ and 69 ψ dihedral restraints were obtained from analysis of 1 HN , 15 N , 13 CO , 13 Ca , and 13 Cb chemical shifts in TALOS 35 . Structures were calculated using ARIA 36 in conjunction with X - PLOR 37 . Initial structures were calculated by docking wiskostatin to WASP using inter - molecular NOEs identified in the complex along with starting structures and distance restraints from the free protein 11 ; calculations were then carried out in an iterative manner using restraints obtained de novo from the WASP – wiskostatin complex using a cutoff value for ambiguous assignment of 0 . 85 . Structures were evaluated using PROCHECK - NMR 38 . Structures were evaluated using PROCHECK - NMR 38 of residues 250 – 309 and 464 – 478 , 88 . 3 % were in the generously allowed region and 0 . 5 % in the disallowed region . Buffer conditions for GBD titration experiments . Buffer conditions were 20 mM MES , pH 5 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 5 % ( v / v ) d 6 - DMSO , 10 % ( v / v ) D 2 O . Compounds were added in this buffer ( from stocks of 700 µ M for wiskostatin , 3 mM for compound 3 , and 600 µ M for compound 4 ) containing appropriate GBD to maintain constant GBD concentration . Chemical shifts were fit to a single - site binding isotherm using Mathematica 5 . 0 ( Wolfram Research ) to yield K d , app . Coordinates .
