The Hippo pathway effectors YAP ( also known as YAP1 ) and TAZ ( also known as WWTR1 ) are regulated by mechanical cues and mediate cellular responses to ECM stiffness 2 , 3 . Here we identified the Ras - related GTPase RAP2 as a key intracellular signal transducer that relays ECM rigidity signals to control mechanosensitive cellular activities through YAP and TAZ . RAP2 is activated by low ECM stiffness , and deletion of RAP2 blocks the regulation of YAP and TAZ by stiffness signals and promotes aberrant cell growth . Mechanistically , matrix stiffness acts through phospholipase C γ 1 ( PLC γ 1 ) to influence levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid , which activates RAP2 through PDZGEF1 and PDZGEF2 ( also known as RAPGEF2 and RAPGEF6 ) . At low stiffness , active RAP2 binds to and stimulates MAP4K4 , MAP4K6 , MAP4K7 and ARHGAP29 , resulting in activation of LATS1 and LATS2 and inhibition of YAP and TAZ . RAP2 , YAP and TAZ have pivotal roles in mechanoregulated transcription , as deletion of YAP and TAZ abolishes the ECM stiffness - responsive transcriptome . Our findings show that RAP2 is a molecular switch in mechanotransduction , thereby defining a mechanosignalling pathway from ECM stiffness to the nucleus . YAP and TAZ function as essential effectors of mechanotransduc - tion to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation 3 – 7 . When cells are shifted from stiff to soft matrices , YAP and TAZ translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , and are thereby inactivated . However , it is unclear how ECM stiffness is signalled to the Hippo pathway . Because small GTPases function as molecular switches in many biological processes 8 , we searched for small GTPases that affect localization of YAP and TAZ in cells seeded on soft ( 1 kPa ) or stiff ( 40 kPa ) matrices ( Supplementary Information ) . RAP2A was identified because its over - expression induced cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ even on a stiff matrix ( Fig . 1a ) . No other GTPases , including the closely related RAP1B , H - RAS , K - RAS , and N - RAS , showed similar activity ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . At high stiffness , both wild - type MCF10A cells and those in which RAP2A , RAP2B and RAP2C were deleted ( RAP2 - KO MCF10A cells ) showed nuclear localization of YAP and TAZ ( Fig . 1b , c ) . At low stiff - ness , wild - type cells exhibited mainly cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ , whereas RAP2 - KO MCF10A cells retained YAP and TAZ in the nucleus ( Fig . 1c ) . Deletion of RAP2 in HEK293A cells also suppressed cytoplas - mic translocation of YAP and TAZ induced by low stiffness ( Fig . 1d , e , Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . Expression of the YAP and TAZ target genes CTGF , CYR61 , and ANKRD1 was repressed by low stiffness in wild - type cells , but not in RAP2 - KO cells ( Fig . 1f ) . Similar results were observed in human mesenchymal stem cells ( Extended Data Fig . 1c – e ) , in which RAP2 deletion suppressed differentiation into adipocytes ( Extended Data Fig . 1f , g ) . In luminal breast cancer MCF7 cells , ECM stiffness modulated localization of YAP and TAZ in a RAP2 - dependent manner , whereas the basal type MDA - MB - 468 cells showed constitutively cytoplasmic localization of YAP and TAZ regardless of stiffness ( Extended Data Fig . 1h – l ) . TWIST1 and β - catenin have been reported to show nuclear – cytoplasmic shuttling in response to physical cues 9 , 10 . TWIST1 , but not β - catenin , displayed nuclear – cytoplasmic translocation in response to ECM stiffness ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . However , RAP2 deletion had no obvious effect on TWIST1 localization . The activity of small GTPases is switched on and off by binding of GTP and GDP , respectively . A RalGDS - RBD pull - down assay showed that low stiffness promotes binding of GTP to RAP2 ( Fig . 2a , Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . Unlike wild - type RAP2A , the GTP - binding - deficient mutant RAP2A ( S17N ) did not induce cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ ( Extended Data Fig . 2b , c ) . PDZGEF1 and PDZGEF2 are RAP2 activators 11 – 13 , and the interaction of RAP2 with PDZGEF1 was enhanced by low stiffness ( Extended Data Fig . 2d ) . We gener - ated cells lacking both activators ( PDZGEF1 / 2 - dKO cells ; Extended Data Fig . 2e , f ) and discovered that they were defective in cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ ( Fig . 2b , c ) and target gene repres - sion ( Extended Data Fig . 2g ) in response to low stiffness . Deletion of PDZGEF1 and PDZGEF2 blunted activation of RAP2 by low stiffness ( Fig . 2d ) , and PDZGEF1 overexpression induced cytoplasmic translo - cation of YAP and TAZ in wild - type but not RAP2 - KO cells ( Extended Data Fig . 2h , i ) . Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) activates RAP2 through PDZGEF1 and PDZGEF2 at the plasma membrane after PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is converted into phosphatidic acid ( PA ) by phos - pholipase D1 ( PLD1 ) and PLD2 13 . Using a GFP - tagged PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reporter , we observed that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was enriched at the plasma membrane at low stiffness ( Fig . 2e , Extended Data Fig . 2j ) . Focal adhe - sions decrease PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by activating PLC γ 1 14 , 15 . Inhibition of PLC γ 1 by U73122 induced PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulation ( Extended Data Fig . 2k ) . We hypothesized that ECM stiffness regulates RAP2 , YAP and TAZ by modulating focal adhesion and local PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 abundance at the plasma membrane . The focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) inhibitor PF573228 or the PLC γ 1 inhibitor U73122 increased binding of GTP by RAP2 and cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ ( Extended Data 1 Department of Pharmacology and Moores Cancer Center , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA , USA . 2 Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , La Jolla , CA , USA . 3 Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA , USA . 4 Department of Bioengineering , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA , USA . 5 Institute of Engineering in Medicine , University of California San Diego , La Jolla , CA , USA . 6 Department of Molecular Enzymology , Faculty of Life Sciences , Kumamoto University , Kumamoto , Japan . 7 Center for Metabolic Regulation of Healthy Aging , Faculty of Life Sciences , Kumamoto University , Kumamoto , Japan . 8 State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases , National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases , West China Hospital of Stomatology , Sichuan University , Chengdu , Sichuan , China . 9 Department of Biochemistry , College of Life Science & Biotechnology , Yonsei University , Seoul , South Korea . 10 Robert J .

By contrast , the PLD1 and PLD2 inhibitor BML279 reduced GTP binding by RAP2 and induced the accumulation of YAP and TAZ in the nucleus ( Extended Data Fig . 3d – f ) . The effects of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on localization of YAP and TAZ were confirmed by experiments involving knockdown of PLC γ 1 and combined knockdown of PLD1 and PLD2 ( Extended Data Fig . 3g – l ) . The nuclear – cytoplasmic shuttling of YAP and TAZ is generally con - trolled by LATS1 - and LATS2 - dependent phosphorylation 2 . However , the role of the Hippo kinase cascade in the regulation of YAP and TAZ by mechanotransduction is not clear 4 – 7 . We found that low ECM stiff - ness induced phosphorylation of LATS1 and LATS2 , and YAP and TAZ , in wild - type cells , and that this phosphorylation was substantially blunted in RAP2 - KO cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Furthermore , RAP2 induced YAP phosphorylation in a GTP - binding - dependent manner ( Extended Data Fig . 3m ) . We proposed that RAP2 controls localization of YAP and TAZ via the Hippo pathway . Consistent with this notion , deletion of LATS1 and LATS2 or combined deletion of MST1 , MST2 and MAP4Ks abolished regulation of YAP and TAZ by ECM rigidity ( Extended Data Fig . 3n , o ) . Hippo pathway core components were similarly required for RAP2 to induce phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . The role of LATS1 and LATS in this regulation was confirmed in LATS1 / 2 - dKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts , as well as in NF2 - KO or MOB1A / MOB1B - dKO HEK293A cells 16 , 17 ( Extended Data Fig . 4c , d ) . MAP4K4 , TNIK ( MAP4K7 ) , and ARHGAP29 are RAP2 effectors 18 – 20 . Notably , ARHGAP29 is one of the RhoGAPs that are transcriptionally activated by YAP 21 , 22 . MAP4K4 kinase activity was stimulated by low stiffness in wild - type but not RAP2 - KO cells ( Extended Data Fig . 4e , f ) . Moreover , low stiffness induced MAP4K4 phosphorylation , as indi - cated by reduced mobility , in a RAP2 - dependent manner ( Extended Data Fig . 4g , h ) . Deletion of the RAP2 - interacting citron domain 19 in MAP4K4 abolished its regulation by RAP2 ( Extended Data Fig . 4i , j ) , and the 130 kDa GAPDH RAP2 W T R AP 2 - K O YAP / T A Z - d K O 0 10 20 30 40 R e l a t i v e m R N A e x p r e ss i o n ANKRD1 40 kPa 1 kPa 25 kDa a YAP / TAZ Flag – RAP2A W T R AP 2 - K O YAP / TAZ d b W T R AP 2 - K O YAP / TAZ DAPI Actin 40 k P a c e RAP2 W T R AP 2 - K O MCF10A Merged YAP / TAZ DAPI 1 k P a W T R AP 2 - K O 35 kDa Vinculin HEK293A W T R AP 2 - K O 25 kDa W T R AP 2 - K O YAP / T A Z - d K O 0 2 4 6 R e l a t i v e m R N A e x p r e ss i o n CTGF W T R AP 2 - K O YAP / T A Z - d K O 0 2 4 6 8 R e l a t i v e m R N A e x p r e ss i o n CYR61 f W T R AP 2 - K O W T R AP 2 - K O 0 40 80 120 C e ll u l a r l o ca t i o n ( % ) N > C N = C N < C 40 kPa 1 kPa Fig . 1 | RAP2 mediates regulation of YAP and TAZ by ECM stiffness . a , Overexpression of Flag – RAP2A induces cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ in HEK293A cells on a stiff ( 40 kPa ) matrix .

Letter reSeArCH mutant also failed to rescue the YAP and TAZ translocation defect in cells lacking MST1 , MST2 and the MAP4Ks ( MST1 / 2 - MAP4K1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 / 7 - 8KO cells ) ( Fig . 3b ) . Notably , a recent study showed that the Drosophila MAP4K4 / 6 / 7 homologue Msn regulates Yki in response to tension 23 . In addition , overexpression of RAP2A led to inactivation of RhoA ( Extended Data Fig . 5a ) , a potent activator for YAP and TAZ 7 , 16 ( Extended Data Fig . 5b – d ) . This action of RAP2A on RhoA was mediated by ARHGAP29 , because YAP phosphorylation induced by ARHGAP29 required its Rho - GAP domain and the Hippo kinase cascade ( Fig . 3c , Extended Data Fig . 5e ) . Deletion of ARHGAP29 compromised inactiva - tion of RhoA by low stiffness ( Extended Data Fig . 5f , g ) . Therefore , RAP2 acts through MAP4K4 , MAP4K6 , MAP4K7 and ARHGAP29 to inhibit YAP and TAZ . Consistent with this finding , MAP4K4 / 6 / 7 - ARHGAP29 - 4KO cells were resistant to RAP2 - induced cytoplasmic translocation and phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ ( Fig . 3d , Extended Data Fig . 5h ) , and displayed impaired responses to ECM stiffness ( Fig . 3e , Extended Data Fig . 5i ) . Collectively , our data reveal a signalling axis that links matrix stiffness to regulation of YAP and TAZ as follows : focal adhesion → PLC γ 1 → PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 → PA → PDZGEF → RAP2 → ARHGAP29 and MAP4K → LATS ( Fig . 3f ) , which works in parallel to the cell spreading – RhoA – cytoskeleton tension - mediated YAP and TAZ translocation mechanism proposed previously 4 , 7 . RAP2 is activated by cell – cell contact 12 , which also presents a mechanical cue to cells and inhibits YAP and TAZ 2 , 17 . Deletion of RAP2 moderately increased nuclear YAP and TAZ at high confluence ( Extended Data Fig . 6a , b ) . Combined deletion of RAP2 with MST1 and MST2 resulted in stronger nuclear accumulation and gene transacti - vation of YAP and TAZ ( Extended Data Fig . 6a – e ) . Deletion of RAP2 , MST1 and MST2 is required to blunt phosphorylation of LATS and inactivation of YAP and TAZ , suggesting that confluency signalling is complex and additional routes , such as cellular junctions , contribute to activation of LATS1 and LATS2 . Deletion of RAP2 selectively enhanced cell growth only at low stiffness ( Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . To assess the role of RAP2 in tumorigenesis , we performed three assays : acinus formation , anchorage - independent growth , and xenotransplantation . First , we used a 3D - culture system with low stiffness hydrogels to assay the formation of MCF10A acini 9 ( Extended Data Fig . 7b ) ; aberrant acinus formation represents irregular cell growth and malignant transformation 9 , 24 . Wild - type cells formed normal acini whereas RAP2 - KO cells generated multi - acinar struc - tures ( Fig . 4a , b , Extended Data Fig . 7c ) , and knockdown of YAP and TAZ significantly reduced the development of aberrant acini . Because MST1 and MST2 mediate some physical signals independent of RAP2 ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) , we generated MCF10A cells lacking RAP2A , RAP2B , RAP2C , MST1 and MST2 ( RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO ; Extended Data Fig . 7d ) . Whereas MST1 / 2 - dKO cells formed relatively normal acini , the RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO cells formed large acini with invasive behaviours ( Extended Data Fig . 7e , f ) even at 150 Pa , similar to the stiffness of normal breast tissue ( Extended Data Fig . 7g , h ) . Second , a colony - formation assay in soft agar showed that RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO cells displayed anchorage - independent growth ( Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . Third , RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO cells showed substantial xenograft growth in immune - deficient mice , whereas MST1 / 2 - dKO cells did not ( Fig . 4c , Extended Data Fig . 8b , c ) . RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO xenografts contained abundant MCF10A cells recapitulating the acinus and duct formation of breast tissue , whereas MST1 / 2 - dKO xenografts consisted of mainly host cells with a small number of MCF10A cells ( Extended Data Fig . 8d , e ) . Moreover , the RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO cells displayed architectural and cytological atypia with signs of malignancy ( Extended Data Fig . 8e ) . Consistently , knock - down of YAP and TAZ suppressed xenograft growth ( Fig . 4d , Extended Data Fig . 8f – h ) . The function of RAP2 in stiffness - regulated growth was confirmed in a xenograft model using H - RAS - V12 - expressing MCF10A cells 25 , 26 ( Fig . 4e , f , Extended Data Fig . 8i , j ) . We used LOX - overexpressing fibroblasts or semisynthetic hyaluronan - derived hydrogels ( soft : 0 . 40 ± 0 . 03 kPa ; stiff : 8 . 98 ± 0 . 33 kPa ) 27 , 28 to assess the effect of stiff - ness on cell growth in xenograft models ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . Under low stiffness or with control fibroblasts , RAP2 - KO cells grew significantly larger xenografts than wild - type cells , whereas the growth advantage of RAP2 - KO cells was decreased at high stiffness or in the presence of LOX - overexpressing fibroblasts ( Fig . 4g , h , Extended Data Fig . 9 ) .

We performed RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) with RAP2 - KO , LATS1 / 2 - dKO , and YAP / TAZ - dKO HEK293A cells to investigate their transcriptional responses to ECM stiffness ( Fig . 4i , Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . In wild - type cells , low stiffness led to downregulation of 814 genes and upregulation of 513 genes . These genes are involved in metabolic processes , such as RNA and macromolecule biosynthesis , and morpho - genesis ( Supplementary Information ) . YAP and TAZ are ‘gate - keepers’ that are responsible for almost all the stiffness - responsive genes , as deletion of YAP and TAZ or LATS1 and LATS2 abolished most of the changes in expression of these genes ( Fig . 4i ) , including AMOTL2 and LGR5 ( Extended Data Fig . 10b ) . Consistent with its role in mechanosignalling , RAP2 deletion completely abolished the changes in expression of 40 – 50 % ( not including those partially blunted ) of stiffness - responsive genes ( Fig . 4i ) . To assess the interplay of RAP2 and Hippo pathway components in stiffness - dependent gene regulation , we enriched YAP - and TAZ - activating genes that were downregulated by YAP and TAZ knockout at high stiffness and upregulated by LATS1 and LATS2 knockout at low stiffness , and YAP - and TAZ - repressing genes that were conversely reg - ulated ( Extended Data Fig . 10c , d ) . These genes define an ECM – Hippo transcriptome that comprises nearly a third of the genes affected by ECM stiffness ( Extended Data Fig . 10e , f ) . RAP2 deletion completely abolished the responses to ECM in about 50 % of ECM – Hippo tran - scriptome genes ( Extended Data Fig . 10g , h ) , and also partially compro - mised many genes . The RAP2 - regulated ECM – Hippo transcriptome revealed that RAP2 controls genes involved in cell growth and adhesion ( for example , CTGF , CYR61 ) , as well as morphogenesis and develop - ment ( for example , KRT8 , KRT18 , GDF6 ) , through the Hippo pathway to respond to ECM stiffness ( Fig . 4j , Supplementary Information ) . This study shows that RAP2 is an intracellular mechanotransducer that relays extracellular mechanical signals to transcriptional regula - tion through the Hippo pathway . ECM stiffness acts through RAP2 and its downstream Hippo kinase cascade to modulate a YAP - and TAZ - mediated mechanoresponsive transcriptome . The identification of this signalling axis provides mechanistic insights into how cellular machinery is driven by mechanical stimuli .

MCF10A cells were from ATCC and maintained as previously described 24 . The pre - malignant derivative of MCF10A cells , MCF10A - T , were generated by infecting MCF10A cells with a lentiviral vector expressing a con - stitutively active H - Ras mutant ( G12V ) as previously described 25 , 26 . Adipocyte - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) were cultured in HMSC growth medium from Cell Applications Inc . , and were differentiated into adipocytes and stained according to a modified protocol 29 . MCF7 and MDA - MB - 468 cells were from ATCC and maintained in DMEM / F12 with 10 % FBS . Insulin ( 0 . 01 mg / ml ) was used for maintaining MCF7 cells . The cell lines were tested to be free of myco - plasma contamination and not experimentally authenticated . Plasmids . Flag - pLJM1 - RAP2A and pRK5 - HA - GST - RAP2A plasmids were pro - vided by D . M . Sabatini ( Addgene 19311 and 14952 ) . PDZGEF1 and ARHGAP29 coding sequences were subcloned from cDNA clones BC117321 and BC093741 ( Transomics Technology ) , respectively . GFP - C1 - PLCdelta - PH was a gift from T . Meyer ( Addgene 21179 ) . The CRISPR – Cas9 system was used to delete genes in HEK293A , MCF10A , MSC , MCF7 and MDA - MB - 468 cells . The plasmids px459 v2 and lentiCRISPR v2 were provided by F . Zhang ( Addgene 62988 and 52961 ) . The single - guide RNA ( sgRNA ) sequences targeting individual genes were as following : RAP2A # 1 : GATGCGCGAGTACAAAGTGG ; RAP2A # 2 : GTATTTC TCG ATG AAGGTGC ; RAP2B # 1 : CATGAGAGAGTACAAAGTGG ; RAP2B # 2 : GGAGCCCGTCACGAACTGCA ; RAP2C # 1 : GGTGAAGGTGAGACTCATGA ; RAP2C # 2 : AGTGACAAACTGCACAGTAA ; PDZGEF1 ( also known as RAPGEF2 ) # 1 : CCCATAACTCCATGGTTAGC ; PDZGEF1 ( also known as RAPGEF2 ) # 2 : CC AGCTAACCATGGAGTTAT ; PDZGEF2 ( also known as RAPGEF6 ) # 1 : TCAA CGCCTGCCTAGCGCCA ; PDZGEF2 ( also known as RAPGEF6 ) # 2 : GCCACCCG AGCGGACTCCCG ; ARHGAP29 # 1 : CTCTACTTACATATT TCCAA ; ARHGAP29 # 2 : AGTTATTCATATACGTCTAG . RAP2 - GTP and RhoA - GTP binding assay . The GST - RalGDS - RBD - expressing BL21 strain was provided by R . Firtel , and the GST - Rhotekin - RBD - expressing BL21 strain was a gift from J . Heller Brown at the University of California , San Diego . The recombinant proteins were purified and stored bound to glutathione - agarose beads . The binding of RAP2 - GTP and RhoA - GTP from cell lysates to RalGDS - RBD - agarose and Rhotekin - RBD - agarose beads , respectively , was performed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 substitute and 1 mM DTT . Cell culture with 2D or 3D polyacrylamide - based hydrogels . 2D culture on hydrogels of high ( 40 . 40 ± 2 . 39 kPa ) or low ( 1 . 00 ± 0 . 31 kPa ) stiffness was as described elsewhere 30 . In brief , 10 μ g / ml human placenta fibronectin or 25 – 50 ug / ml rat tail collagen I were used to coat the sulfo - sanpah - activated hydrogels according to the preferences of the cell lines . 3D culture followed a protocol with the modification that the Matrigel base was replaced with fibronectin - coated hydrogels 9 , 24 . Staining and microscopy . For immunofluorescence , cells were fixed in 4 % for - maldehyde / PBS for 10 min and then were treated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 or sap - onin ( only for staining PIP2 GFP reporter ) for 15 min . After blocking , the cells were stained with corresponding antibodies . Most images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal microscope and then were exported from NIS elements imaging software . Images in Fig . 2d and Extended Data Fig . 4c , d were taken with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope , and Image J was used to merge the signals from channels . For immunohistochemistry , xenografts were subjected to heat - induced antigen retrieval using 10 mM sodium citrate buffer followed by 3 % H 2 O 2 for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity . Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with YAP / TAZ antibody and detected using Vectastain elite ABC kit and DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit ( Vector Laboratories ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Preparation of semi - synthetic hyaluronan - derived hydrogels . Under aseptic conditions , Glycosil ( ESI Bio , GS222 ) , Gelin - S , ( ESI Bio , GS231 ) , and Extralink ( ESI Bio , GS3006 ) were dissolved in degassed water ( ESI Bio , GS240 ) according to the manufacturer’s directions . To make soft hydrogels , stock concentrations of 10 mg / ml Glycosil , 10 mg / ml Gelin - S , and 5 mg / ml Extralink were made per manufacturer’s directions . To make stiff hydrogels , concentrated stocks of Glycosil and Extralink were prepared by solubilization in reduced volumes to make 2 × Glycosil and 5 × Extralink . Prior to use , aliquots were taken from each vial to make solutions at 1 : 5 ratios of Extralink : ( Glycosil + Gelin - S ) and 5 × Extralink : ( 2 × Glycosil + Gelin - S ) for soft and stiff hydrogels , respectively . For all conditions , the amount of Gelin - S was kept constant to ensure the same number of gelatin - based cell binding sites . In order to perform atomic force microscopy , the Glycosil and Gelin - S compo - nents were mixed thoroughly and then the Extralink was added to initiate gelation . Subsequently , 50 μ l of the mixture was added drop - wise to DCMS - treated glass slides and a methacrylated coverslip was placed on top . Each sample was prepared in triplicate . The slides were then incubated at 37 °C until complete gelation . For the samples tested , this occurred within 30 – 40 min of incubation at 37 °C . Upon gelation , hydrogel stiffness was measured by AFM . Hydrogels were then placed in PBS containing 1 % antibiotic / antimycotic at 37 °C and the stiffness was measured 1 , 24 , and 48 h after mixing . AFM measurement procedure . AFM was performed to measure hydrogel stiffness as previously described 31 . In brief , indentations were made using a pyrex - nitride probe with a pyramid tip ( spring constant ~ 0 . 04 N / m , 35° half - angle opening , NanoAndMore USA Corporation , PNP - TR ) connected to a MFP - 3D Bio Atomic Force Microscope ( Oxford Instruments ) mounted on a Ti - U fluorescence inverted microscope ( Nikon Instruments ) . Probes were calibrated using the Igor 6 . 34A software ( WaveMetrics ) . Samples were then loaded on the AFM , submersed in PBS , and indented at a velocity of 2 μ m / s with a trigger force of 2 nN . About 20 force measurements were performed over a 90 μ m × 90 μ m region per gel . Measurements were made each day for three separate gels per condition . Elastic modulus was calculated based on a Hertz - based fit using a built - in code written in Igor 6 . 34A software . Animal studies . Female NOD / SCID mice ( 8 – 9 weeks old ) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory , and 8 – 9 - week - old female nude mice were provided by the animal care program at University of California , San Diego . The mice were hosted in a special pathogen - free room under standard 12 : 12 - h light : dark cycle , fed with standard rodent chow and water ad libitum , and randomized before experiments . The sample size choice was not pre - determined for each experiment . When com - paring RAP2 - MST1 / 2 - KO MCF10A cells and MST1 / 2 - dKO MCF10A cells , a total of 5 × 10 6 MCF10A cells in 50 % high concentration Matrigel ( BD Bioscience ) dissolved in PBS were subcutaneously inoculated into a NOD / SCID mouse . When comparing RAP2 - KO MCF10A and MCF10A - T cells with wild - type MCF10A and MCF10A - T cells , 5 × 10 6 cells in 50 % Matrigel were injected into nude mice subcutaneously . When comparing RAP2 - KO with wild - type MCF7 cells , 2 × 10 6 MCF7 cells and 4 × 10 5 LOX - expressing or control NIH3T3 cells in 50 % Matrigel / PBS were co - injected subcutaneously into nude mice . For the semi - synthetic hyaluronan - derived hydrogels , 2 × 10 6 MCF7 cells in 20 μ l PBS suspension were embedded into 200 μ l of soft and stiff formulations as described in the prepara - tion of hydrogels . After brief gelation ( 5 min ) at room temperature , the cell - laden hydrogels were subcutaneously injected into nude mice . The investigators were blinded to group allocations during data collection and analyses . All procedures followed the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and the IACUC at the University of California , San Diego approved the experiments . For subcutaneous tumour growth , the maximum single tumour cannot exceed 2 cm in diameter in mice according to the guidelines provided by the animal care program at University of California , San Diego , and no experiments in this study generated tumour burden over this limit . RNA interference . The lentiviral vectors pLKO . 1 - hygromycin ( Addgene 24150 ) and pLKO . 1 - Blasticidin ( Addgene 26655 ) were used to clone the following sense sequences to knock down human YAP or TAZ : negative control : CCTA AGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG ( cloned into pLKO . 1 - hygromycin and pLKO . 1 - blasticidin ) ; YAP # 1 : GCCACCAAGCTAGATAAAGAA ( pLKO . 1 - hygromycin ) ; YAP # 2 : GACATCTTCTGGTCAGAGATA ( pLKO . 1 - hygromycin ) ; TAZ # 1 : GCGTTCTTGTGACAGATTATA ( pLKO . 1 - blasticidin ) ; TAZ # 2 : GCTCATGA GTATGCCCAATGC ( pLKO . 1 - blasticidin ) . The resulting plasmids were used to package lentiviruses and the target cells were infected with an MOI of 0 . 5 . Duplex siRNAs targeting PLC γ 1 and PLD1 / 2 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies , Inc . and transfected into cells with RNAiMAX ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The sequences are as follows : PLC γ 1 # 1 sense strand 5 ′ - rGrArCrCrUrCrArUrCrArGrCrUrArCrUrArUrGrAr GrArAAC - 3 ′ ; anti - sense strand 5 ′ - rGrUrUrUrCrUrCrArUrArGrUrArGrCrUrGr ArUrGrArGrGrUrCrArA - 3 ′ .

Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) from HEK293A cells seeded on high and low stiffness fibronectin - coated hydrogels . Three replicates for each sample were gen - erated and analysed . The resulting RNA was then used to prepare libraries using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit Set A ( Illumina , RS - 122 - 2101 ) or Set B ( Illumina , RS - 122 - 2102 ) . The libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 ( single - end 50 - bp reads ) . Reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using STAR 32 . Only uniquely mapped reads were kept for further analysis . Number of reads for each gene were counted using htseq - count 33 according to Gencode human annotation release 24 . DeSeq2 34 was used to identify differential expressed genes with default parameters . Genes with adjusted P value < 0 . 1 were considered to be differentially expressed . GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differential expressed genes was performed using DAVID 35 . Statistical analysis . Microsoft Excel was used for t - tests , and Graphpad Prism v6 was used for two - way ANOVA tests . When P is smaller than 0 . 0001 , Graphpad Prism v6 does not provide a precise P value and instead only shows a range of P < 0 . 0001 . Data availability .

For CTGF , * sgRAP2 versus wild - type at 0 . 4 kPa , P = 0 . 020 ; * * 0 . 4 kPa versus 9 . 0 kPa for wild - type , P = 0 . 0032 . For CYR61 , * sgRAP2 versus wild - type , P = 0 . 025 ; * * 0 . 4 kPa versus 9 . 0 kPa for wild - type , P = 0 . 0033 . g , Xenograft tumours . For wild - type cells grown at 0 . 4 kPa , eight independent xenografts were initially generated in nude mice . However , owing to animal deaths , only six xenografts were recovered . For wild - type cells grown at 9 kPa , nine independent xenografts were generated . For sgRAP2 cells grown at both 0 . 4 kPa and 9 kPa , eight independent xenografts were generated . h , RAP2 deletion preferentially promotes MCF7 malignancy at low stiffness . MCF7 xenografts stained with haematoxylin and eosin . Wild - type cells embedded in 0 . 4 kPa matrix produced mostly tubular and some cribriform structures whereas those embedded in 9 kPa matrix produced mostly solid nests , as well as more marked cellular pleomorphism and nuclear atypia . sgRAP2 cells showed more malignant architecture and morphology at 0 . 4 ka , while at high stiffness ( 9 kPa ) sgRAP2 and wild - type cells exhibited similar morphology .
