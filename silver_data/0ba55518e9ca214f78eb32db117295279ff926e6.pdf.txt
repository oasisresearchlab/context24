Aspergillus nidulans swoQ PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN POLARIZED HYPHAL GROWTH A Thesis by BRIGITTE BOMER Submitted to the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies of Texas A & M University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MASTER OF SCIENCE Chair of Committee , Brian D . Shaw Co - Chair of Committee , Daniel J . Ebbole Committee Member , Xiaorong Lin Head of Department , Leland S . Pierson December 2016 Major Subject : Plant Pathology Copyright 2016 Brigitte Bomer ii ABSTRACT Filamentous fungi form polarized hyphae by concentrating the addition of new material at the apex of the cell . The mechanics of polarized hyphal growth are coordinated by the cytoskeleton which utilizes microtubules ( MTs ) and filamentous actin in order to facilitate vesicle trafficking . The cytoskeletal machinery implicated in the regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis during polarized growth is complex and has been studied extensively in recent years . Despite these efforts there are many gaps in the current growth model , and the exact role of the cytoskeleton on secretion and internalization mechanisms during polarized growth remains to be elucidated . In order to address this knowledge gap , this study investigates the contribution of cytoskeletal elements on polarized growth . In this study , I identified the Aspergillus nidulans temperature - sensitive ( TS ) mutant , swoQ . A mutant allele in the swoQ gene results in abnormal polarity maintenance and cell morphogenesis in the swoQ strain , as evidenced by the presence of abnormally swollen cells . A forward genetic screen revealed the swoQ polarity defect was suppressed following transformation with the pRG3 - 47 - 1 library plasmid which encodes myoA , a class I myosin motor protein . A sub - clone of myoA was introduced into the swoQ mutant and wild - type which resulted in restoration of polarized growth in the polarity mutant and hyper - branching in both strains . To further assess the influence of swoQ , the localization of various polarity markers including : FimA : : GFP , Exo84 : : GFP , DnfA : : GFP , and DnfB : : GFP , were examined in the mutant strain . The localization of FimA : : GFP and Exo84 : : GFP was abnormal in the swoQ iii mutant . FimA is an actin nucleating protein which works alongside MyoA , an essential myosin in A . nidulans . Together these proteins facilitate the formation of actin patches which drive endocytosis . Here I show that overexpression of MyoA has a polarization effect on growing cells and is able to suppress the growth defect of the swoQ mutant . iv DEDICATION I dedicate this thesis to my mother and father who have supported me my entire life and inspired me to become a scientist , and my fiancé for his patience and love . v ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank my committee chair , Dr .

Polarization allows for the cell to assemble specialized domains which facilitate complex developmental processes . These domains are spatially defined molecular cues which allow the cell to establish structural and molecular asymmetry at the cell surface . These cues generate sites at the plasma membrane ( PM ) which elicit the reorganization of the cell around these domains . Polarity plays a role in a variety of diverse processes such as differentiation , localized membrane growth , and directional cell migration ( 1 ) . The life cycle of filamentous fungi is dominated by apical extension , continuous growth at the tip of the cell ( 2 ) . This group of fungi utilizes hyperpolarized cells , called hyphae ( 3 ) . Hyphal filaments extend at the tip of the cell which allows the fungus to orient growth in response to environmental stimuli . This specialized ability is adapted to assist the organism in search of nutrients , causing invasive growth in tissue ( 4 ) . Invasive hyphal growth is a requirement for colonization . Many fungi cause disease in humans or economically important crops by growing invasive hyphae . Therefore , mechanisms involved in fungal pathogenesis need to be understood in order to provide insight on disease control strategies and development of anti - fungal agents . Previous studies have only scratched the surface of understanding the mechanism of polarized growth in filamentous fungi . 2 The amenable genetics of Aspergillus nidulans , as well as the prevalence of apical extension , make it an ideal model for studying polar growth ( 5 ) . Various genetic and biological studies in A . nidulans and other fungi attempted to develop a general outline to describe the molecular framework governing hyphal growth . In this model , the fusion of secretory vesicles at the hyphal tip has been shown to drive apical extension ( 6 - 8 ) . Vesicles at the apex provide materials needed for tip growth and are centralized around a network of cytoskeletal elements which facilitate vesicle trafficking ( 9 ) . The movement of these vesicles is facilitated by microtubules ( MT ) and filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , which work alongside one another to facilitate endocytosis . Vesicles are trafficked to the tip by the cytoskeleton via motor proteins . These vesicles fuse with the cytoplasmic membrane and deliver their contents in order to expand the membrane ( 10 ) . Contained within these vesicles are cell - wall remodeling enzymes ( glucan synthases , chitin synthases , and endoglucanases ) ( 11 ) . The activity of these enzymes promote expansion at the apex by creating an area of increased cell - wall plasticity which allows for the addition of new membrane ( 12 , 13 ) . Spitzenkörper The vesicle supply center located at the tip of the cell is the center for polarized growth ( 10 ) . This collection of vesicles in the apical dome of fungal hyphae make up a structure called the Spitzenkörper ( SPK ) , named after the German word for “apical body” ( 3 ) . The SPK is an intracellular structure associated with cytoskeleton and the endomembrane system , which coordinates growth directionality in filamentous fungi ( 11 ) . 3 The SPK is comprised of an aggregation of large apical macrovesicles ( 70 to 90 nm in diameter ) and small microvesicles ( 30 to 40 nm in diameter ) ( 10 ) . This collection of vesicles has been shown to be centralized around the actin cytoskeleton ( 14 ) . More recently , the visualization of actin dynamics using Lifeact in A . nidulans allowed for the observation of two new structures centralized around the SPK and sites of F - actin polymerization ( 15 ) . The apical actin array ( AAA ) , is found just behind the tip , while the subapical web ( SAW ) is located greater than 15 µ m behind the endocytic collar ( 15 ) . Previously , A . nidulans formin SepA , which polymerizes F - actin in growing hyphae , was found to localize at the apical dome , septa and a spot at the center of the SPK . ( 16 ) . Together these data affirm that the dynamics of the SPK is centralized around this cytoskeletal matrix affirming the fact that actin elongates around the SPK and aids in the delivery of vesicles to the tip . The vesicles have been shown to enclose a variety of cell - wall components needed for polarized tip expansion such as membranes , glycoproteins , and biosynthetic enzymes ( 6 , 17 , 18 ) . For example , in Neurospora crassa chitin synthase Chs - 1 is present in microvesicles which localize to the inner region of the SPK . In contrast , glucan synthase Gs - 1 is present in macrovesicles which accumulate in the outer stratum of the SPK , encircling Chs - 1 ( 11 , 19 ) . Additionally , type 2 P4 - type ATPase phospholipid transporters ( flippases ) , DnfA and DnfB , have been identified in A . nidulans ( 20 ) . Flippases , like DnfA and DnfB , facilitate the movement of phospholipids between membrane leaflets and in A . nidulans have been shown to play a role in the asymmetrical distribution of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine at the tip . DnfA and DnfB display differential 4 localization and are likely complementary to the population of secretory vesicles in the SPK ( 20 ) . DnfA was shown to localize to the apical PM in growing cells . While DnfB was shown to localize at a compact locus just behind the cell tip at the center of the DnfA apical structure . The differentiation between localization these flippases and vesicles are presumably related to the spatial control of cell - wall synthesis and hyphal extension ( 20 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae sites of polarization have been shown to be directed by a protein complex called the polarisome ( 21 ) . The yeast polarisome is responsible for microfilament formation at polarized growth sites , the organization of actin , and is responsible for linking cell polarity regulators such as Cdc42p to the cytoskeleton . Similar to the polarisome , the SPK has been shown to regulate microfilament organization ( 12 ) . Yeast modules , Bud1 Ras - GTPase and Cdc42 Rho - GTPase , are conserved in filamentous fungi and have been shown to be responsible for the assembly of actin filaments and localization of other components to the apex of the cell during a polarization event in yeast ( 22 , 23 ) . Efforts to understand the polarisome in filamentous fungi has allowed fungal biologists to identify several yeast polarisome orthologs in A . nidulans ( 21 , 24 ) . For example , the actin polymerizing protein , SepA , is an ortholog of the yeast protein Bni1which localizes at the SPK ( 25 ) . This data and the identification of 16 polarisome orthologs in A . nidulans suggest that filamentous fungi utilize various polarisome - like components at the hyphal tip along with MTs and F - actin to organize the SPK ( 17 , 21 ) . Despite these analyses , it still remains unclear how a hypha establishes polarity and the full extent of the relationship between the SPK and the polarisome remains to be determined . 5 Endocytosis and exocytosis The SPK is involved in hyphal morphogenesis and is able to control apical growth both spatially and temporally . As it moves along the apical dome the SPK is able to control the directionality and speed of polarized tip extension . This ability involves the recycling of proteins coordinated by secretion and internalization mechanisms at the tip of the cell . These processes allow fungi to rapidly rearrange the direction of their growth in response to external stimuli ( 26 , 27 ) . Exocytosis , a secretion mechanism implicated in membrane expansion in filamentous fungi , uses cytoskeletal elements to traffic secretory vesicles to the SPK . These vesicles are then distributed to specific sites along the PM where they fuse to deliver enzymes and material needed for cell - wall expansion ( 28 , 29 ) . The polarized transport of vesicles to the PM has been shown to be regulated by the Arp2 / 3 ( Actin - patch - associated ) complex ( 30 ) and exocyst complex ( 31 ) . The Arp 2 / 3 complex , localized at the endocytic collar , regulates actin nucleation and stimulates polymerization ; meanwhile , the exocyst complex is responsible for the tethering of secretory vesicles to the apical membrane ( 32 ) . Counter to exocytosis , endocytosis is an internalization mechanism associated with nutritional uptake , recycling of the PM , and maintenance of hyphal shape ( 33 - 35 ) . This mechanism uses several dozen proteins to target and form a coated vesicle to internalize molecules found at the PM . Soluble N - Ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor Attachment Receptor ( SNARE ) proteins facilitate vesicle docking at the Golgi where the fate of the vesicles is determined . The contents of these vesicles are either targeted for degraded or recycled back to the apex of the cell to be reused at the tip ( 36 ) . In combination , these two highly complex processes employ numerous proteins and the 6 cytoskeleton to regulate membrane trafficking and hyphal growth in filamentous fungi . The actin cytoskeleton Together the actin and MT cytoskeleton are centralized at the tip ready to interact with the vesicle supply center to control tip growth . Secretion , membrane internalization mechanisms , and the cytoskeleton facilitate polarized membrane expansion and hyphal morphogenesis . Exocytosis relies on various cytoskeletal elements to ensure targeted secretion . This mechanism relies on the cytoskeleton to assist in the intracellular transport of vesicles and to overcome the energetic barrier for membrane fusion ( 28 , 29 , 37 ) . The fungal cytoskeletal matrix is a dynamic structure comprised of thee polymers : F - actin , MTs , and septins ( 38 ) . Together these structural polymers form a complex network of interlinking filaments and tubules which are capable of polymerizing and depolymerizing at different rates to drive filament dynamics . The varied functions of the cytoskeleton rely on the distinct mechanical properties of these polymers and the filaments they form . Three populations of actin exist in filamentous fungi , these are : patches , cables and rings . Actin patches are associated with sites of PM invagination and endocytosis ( 39 , 40 ) . These patches are located in the subapical collar have been shown to be associated with sites of endocytic uptake and various actin binding proteins , such as ARP - 2 / 3 complex , fimbrin , and coronin ( 35 , 37 , 41 ) . The role of the A . nidulans proteins actin , ActA , and fimbrin , FimA , in hyphal growth was examined by studying their localization in vivo . Both ActA : : GFP and FimA : : GFP have a similar localization in growing cells , and enriched in the subapical collar of growing hyphae and in septa in A . nidulans ( 42 ) . This endocytic 7 collar can be seen in action in confocal videos of live hyphae tagged with Lifeact ( 15 ) . The subapical collar is a major site of endocytosis , which allows the recycling of various components needed for polarized growth in order to promote continuous growth ( 20 , 33 , 35 , 40 , 42 , 43 ) . Actin patches co - localize with various endocytic proteins , such as : Sac6 , Sla2 , Vrp1 , Arc35 , Rvs167 ( 44 - 49 ) . The growth and shrinkage of actin cables is controlled by a dynamic treadmilling process . This process simultaneously couples various rates of actin polymerization at the plus - end of the filament and disassembly actin monomers at the minus end . This property gives actin the ability to rapidly remodel itself in response to the cell ' s requirements at the time ( 32 ) . The actin cables formed by treadmilling are found in the SPK and are anticipated to play a role in the delivery of secretory vesicles ( 8 , 18 ) . Myosins are a class of actin - based motor proteins which rely on actin cables in order to facilitate the transport of proteins transporting different cargo ( such as secretory vesicles and mRNAs ) to sites of polarization ( 33 , 34 ) . These proteins rely on actin - activated hydrolysis of ATP by the myosin in order to move along actin cables . A . nidulans possesses four classes of myosins : class I , class II , class V , and the fungus - specific class XVII which contains a myosin motor head and a chitin synthase domain . In A . nidulans class II and V myosins were found to play a role in tip growth and septation . Class II , MyoB was found to localize to the septum as nodes or strings and deletion of this motor - protein led to cytokinesis defects or septation failure , lack of conidiation , extreme growth defects , and improper chitin deposition ( 43 ) . While the Class V , MyoE appears as small puntae throughout the hyphae and at septa ( 50 - 52 ) . MyoB and MyoE orthologs had a 8 similar role in A . fumigatus where a Δ myoB leads to irregular accumulation of chitin and irregular septation , and Δ myoE exhibited significant growth defects such as hyper - septation and a loss of hyphal polarity and conidiation ( 53 ) . Class I myosins , like S . cerevisiae Myo5 , are characterized for their possession of a single heavy chain which like other myosins is made of a motor , neck and tail domain . The class I motor domain of this myosin contains both an ATPase site and an ATP - sensitive F - actin - binding site , while the neck domain binds to a single light chain , like calmodulin . An actin binding site found in the head , tail and membranes allow for this class of myosins to cross link actin filaments to membranes by the use of force generated by the actin - activated hydrolysis of ATP ( 54 ) . This structure provides this class of motor proteins the ability to nucleate actin which facilitates the internalization of the endocytic vesicles . Myo5 has been shown to be present in endocytic patches during invagination ( 55 - 58 ) . Class I myosins have also been shown to regulate actin nucleation via the Arp2 / 3 complex by interacting with : Las17p and Bbc1p ( 48 , 55 , 59 ) . The N . crassa class I motor protein , Myo - 1 is a key component of the endocytic collar ( 35 ) . Myo - 1 is an actin nucleating factor which was shown to accumulate in cortical patches of the subapical collar . The Myo - 1 - GFP was shown to colocalize with other endocytic markers such as fimbrin and coronin , in a collection of small patches in the subapical collar . Deletion of myo - 1 in N . crassa resulted in distorted hyphal growth and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . This deletion caused a 95 % reduction in growth and lacked aerial mycelia . The Δ myo - 1 mutant was unable to support a stable SPK which resulted in a disruption of normal exocytosis , resulting in hyphae with variable bulging 9 ( 41 ) . Whereas the myo - 1 ortholog , myoA is essential in A . nidulans and cannot be studied using this approach ( 60 ) . A . nidulans has a single class I myosin which has been shown to colocalize with actin - rich regions in the in cortex of hyphal tips ( 61 ) . Examination of a conditionally lethal myoA mutant on repressing medium resulted in enlarged circular cells which showed reduced levels of secretion . These enlarged cells were incapable of hyphal extension and eventually died . The morphological alterations observed in the myoA further validate the critical role myoA plays in stability and function of the SPK in polarized growth and secretion ( 60 ) . Microtubule cytoskeleton Various cytoskeletal elements have been studied for their role in endocytosis and exocytosis . Filamentous fungi utilize the cytoskeleton to regulate membrane trafficking and hyphal growth in filamentous fungi . For example , the long distance transport of vesicles toward the tip of the cell is facilitated by MTs . In A . nidulans GFP - α - tublin revealed that MTs are able to persist in a region in the tip of growing hyphae and ( 62 ) . Assembly of these MTs requires the presence of a MT organizing centers ( MTOC ) . A MTOC is a major site of MT nucleation which provides directionality to the MT complex . These centers are primarily composed of γ - tubulin , a protein originally identified in A . nidulans which is conserved throughout eukaryotes ( 63 - 65 ) . In higher eukaryotes γ - tubulin assembles into a 2 . 2 - MDa ring complex comprised of 13 γ - tubulin subunits which associate with other proteins to form a γ - tubulin ring complex ( γ - TuRCs ) ( 64 ) . This protein complex facilitates de novo formation of MTs by mimicking the plus - end allowing 10 ⍺ - tubulin and ! - tubulin to bind ( 64 - 66 ) . MTOCs have yet to be seen in hyphal tips and γ - tubulin has not yet been observed in A . nidulans despite numerous investigations . In a search for the origin of MT polymerization , KipA , a kinesin motor protein was used to track the plus - end of MTs . This investigation revealed MTs do polymerize at the tip and that GFP - KipA accumulates at MT plus - ends . The Δ kipA strain was also shown to loose directionality and grow in curves in the , due to a mislocalization of the SPK in the apex ( 67 ) . KipA has been shown to be a part of the MT complex which directly interacts with LIS1 ( 50 ) . Dynein is also a part of this complex along with the kinesin motor protein KipA . Dynesin has been shown to associated with the plus - end of this complex and has been shown to localize to the tip and moves toward the cell periphery as it grows ( 68 , 69 ) . Once dynein reaches the cortex of the cell it is activated and pulls the attached MT to the cortex of the cell . The Kip2 motor protein has been shown to be responsible for the localization of several proteins at the plus - end ( 68 ) . 11 Rationale and significance Despite the fact that many studies have examined the molecular components involved in apical extension it remains unclear how the cytoskeleton governs polarity establishment and tip growth in hyphae . The goal of this study was to use A . nidulans as a model to further examine the molecular toolkit used by hyphae to maintain directional growth . Previous studies which used forward genetic approaches to examine developmental mutants in A . nidulans were fruitful in identifying genes involved in polarity and similar investigations are likely to will reveal additional genes participating in polarized growth ( 34 , 70 - 76 ) . In order to identify proteins associated with the cytoskeleton this study examined a collection of temperature - sensitive ( TS ) mutant ' s defective in polarized hyphal growth . In this study , the A . nidulans developmental mutant swoQ was identified for its presence of abnormally swollen cells , and named after its “ swo - llen” phenotype . The localization of various polarity markers , such as FimA , Exo84 , DnfA and DnfB , revealed that swoQ plays an important role in the stability various endocytic and cytoskeletal components . It was also determined that overexpression of MyoA , an essential class I myosin in A . nidulans , has an epistatic effect on swoQ and was shown to restore polarized growth in this developmental mutant . 12 CHAPTER II MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and culture conditions All strains , plasmids , and primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 , Table 2 , and Table 3 , respectively . In order to compare polarity phenotypes strains were cultured at 30 o C and at 42 o C , and grown on media as previously reported ( 72 , 77 ) . All reagents for media , buffer , and supplements were purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) unless otherwise indicated .

This collection was screened for polarity defective mutants by replica plating strains at 30 o C and at 42 o C on fully supplemented minimal media . Strains of interest were then examined microscopically using methods previously described ( 34 ) . The strain of interest , tsC - 47 , was identified in this screen and selected for its TS polarity defect as evidenced by the presence of abnormally swollen cells and uneven diameter hyphae . The mutation carried by tsC - 47 was later defined as swoQ , and its role in polarization was assessed using standard protocols as previously described ( 76 ) . Growth experiments Temperature - shift experiments Growth experiments in this study were performed to evaluate polar growth . Temperature - shift experiments were conducted to further characterize polarity phenotype and assess whether polar growth can be recovered following a downshift or lost following an upshift . Mutant strains were grown on solid media with appropriate supplements then subjected to an upshift ( from 30°C for 11 hours to 42°C for 5 hours ) and a downshift ( from 42°C for 11 hours to 30°C for 5 hours ) , followed by microscopic observation using methods previously described ( 76 ) . 15 Conidia production assay In order to examine if conidia production in the swoQ mutant was hindered , assays to quantify sporulation were performed as previously described ( 80 ) . In this assay 10 µ l of sterile water containing 10 6 spores were placed in the center of a solid plate of media and each strain was replica plated at both 30 ° C and 42 ° C for 5 days . Conidia were then collected with 2ml of sterile water and then quantified with a hemocytometer . These experiments were performed in triplicate . Mating and genetic analysis of single gene mutation Various experiments in this study utilized mating as a tool for genetic characterization and strain manipulation . All crosses in this study were performed using standard procedures on strain pairs containing reciprocal auxotrophic markers ( 34 , 77 ) . Since A . nidulans is haploid , a single gene mutation is expected to segregate 1 : 1 in crosses with wild - type . A sexual cross between swoQ ( pyrG89 ; wA3 ; pyroA4 ; veA1 ) and wild - type strain A234 ( pabaA1 ; yA2 ) was performed to determine if the mutant phenotype was found at a single locus . The wetA mutation is commonly used as a standard genetic marker found on chromosome VII of A . nidulans FGSC A4 ( 81 ) . This marker and was selected because it was predicted to be linked to myoA on this chromosome . Both of these genes are found on the same side of the centromere on chromosome VII and because of this have a very small chance of recombination . The percentage recombination of the meiotic progeny in this cross were then analyzed in order to determine distance . The map distance between swoQ 16 to each marker was calculated as previously described ( 34 ) . The wetA strain used in this study , Asuw7 , was generated by crossing A580 to ASL91 ( Table 1 ) . Asuw7 was then crossed with swoQ mutant in order to determine the genetic linkage between the wetA and swoQ genes in relation to myoA . Ascospores from this cross were replica plated and grown on media with appropriate supplements in order to score genotypes . The swoQ mutant was also crossed with various WT strains in order to integrate various polarity markers such as : Exo84 : : GFP , Fimbrin : : GFP , DnfA : : GFP , DnfB : : GFP . Microscopic observations and imaging Live - cell imaging techniques were used to visualize the spatiotemporal organization of proteins involved in polarization during hyphal growth . Germlings in this study were grown on solid minimal media with appropriate supplements . Microscopic observations were made as previously described and images captured with a Hamamatsu Flash Orca - ER cooled CCD camera ( 34 , 42 , 82 ) . A detailed description of this imaging system was previously described ( 34 ) . The imaging system used in this study was an Olympus BX51 microscope ( Olympus America , Melville , NY , USA ) outfitted with differential interference contrasts ( DIC ) optics and the Olympus DSU spinning disc confocal imaging system which will interface a Windows 7 based desktop using SlideBook™ ( Version 5 . 0 . 0 . 1 ) . Image and figures in this study were prepared using Adobe Photoshop CC 2014 version 14 . 2 . In order to visualize protein dynamics and localization in vivo , strains containing fluorescent markers were imaged using previously described live - cell imaging techniques 17 ( 15 ) . Excitation wavelengths at 470 to 480 nm and emission wavelengths from 510 to 550 nm were used to visualize GFP . Olympus U - MNIBA2 filter cubes ( Olympus America , Melville , NY , USA ) were used alongside a specialized dichroic mirror in order to visualize of GFP . This dichroic mirror allowed for emitted light at the appropriate wavelength , 505 nm for GFP . Transformation of A . nidulans In order to identify the genes involved in polarization , the swoQ mutant was transformed with a genomic library , constructed in the autonomously replicating vector pRG3 - AMA1 - NotI ( Table 2 ) , as previously described ( 54 , 79 ) . The AMA1 sequence encoded in this vector allowed for extrachromosomal replication within transformants and increases transformation efficiency at least 100 - fold to 1 – 2 X 10 4 transformants / µ g DNA ( 54 , 83 ) . This property facilitates plasmid recovery and isolation of the plasmid responsible for restoring polarity to the swoQ mutant in subsequent steps . The pRG3 - AMA1 genomic library ( Table 2 ) used in this study was constructed using 20 genome equivalents of A . nidulans which were digested then ligated into the vector ranging from 6kb - 20kb and averaging an insert size of 9kb ( 54 ) . In order to transform swoQ , and in all transformations in this study , protoplasts were prepared and used as recipients of exogenous DNA previously described ( 54 , 79 , 84 ) . All strains in this study are auxotrophic which allowed for the selection of prototrophic transformants as previously described ( 77 ) . swoQ mutants were transformed with the genomic library and selected by assaying for restoration to pyrG prototrophy and restoration of the wild - type phenotype at 42ºC . 18 Plasmids were recovered from transformants which displayed the restored polarization phenotype . Recovered plasmids were then re - introduced into the swoQ mutant to confirm their ability to rescue the polarity defect . Recovery of plasmids The pRG3 - AMA1 vector plasmid allows for autonomous replication , which facilitates plasmid recovery in subsequent cloning steps ( 79 ) . Genomic DNA was isolated from swoQ transformants which displayed recovered polarity following transformation with the genomic library using standard protocols ( 85 ) . DNA isolated from these transformants was then introduced into E . coli DH5 α ™ competent cells , using standard methods ( 79 ) . Following transformation , bacteria containing the plasmid of interest were selected for based on ampicillin resistance encoded by the plasmid . The genomic insert found within isolated plasmids were presumed to be responsible for restoring polar growth of the swoQ mutant allele . To test this , recovered plasmids were then re - introduced into the swoQ mutant to re - confirm the rescued plasmid was responsible for the restoration to wild - type growth . Sequencing and identification of myoA gene Once the isolated plasmid was shown to restore wild - type growth in the mutant strain , the genomic insert of this plasmid was sequenced at the Texas A & M University Laboratory for Genome Technology ( College Station , TX , USA ) . using inward facing primers previously described ( 34 ) . These primers , M13 forward and RG3 reverse ( Table 19 3 ) were designed specifically to the flanking region of the genomic insert contained in the pRG3 - AMA1 vector ( 34 ) . The flanking sequence obtained from this reaction was used to obtain the full sequence of the genomic insert . This data was analyzed using the Broad Institute A . nidulans genomic database ( 58 ) and then compared to the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) database ( 59 ) using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ( BLAST ) ( 86 ) . Sequencing of AN1558 in tsC - 47 The A . nidulans gene AN1558 along with 1kb both upstream and downstream was amplified through PCR using primers , MyoA + 1kb up and MyoA + 1kb down ( Table 3 ) . This PCR used Thermo Scientific® Phusion Flash High - Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( Waltham , MA , USA ) in order to amplify 6 , 079bp from tsC - 47 genomic DNA . Following amplification of this gene was cloned into the pGEM® - T Easy Vector ( Promega Corporation , Madison , WI , USA ) . The resulting plasmid was named pGEM - swoQ - myoA , and then sequenced by Eton Bioscience ( San Diego , CA , USA ) in order to determine if the AN1558 gene inside of the swoQ mutant possessed a mutation . The pGEM - swoQ - myoA plasmid was sequenced using 14 different insert specific primers ( MyoA seq . P1 through 14 ) , and two vector specific primers , T7 and SP6 ( Table 3 ) . These primers allowed for at least 2x coverage of the entire 6 , 079 bp fragment . Sequence data from this sequencing reaction was concatenated using Sequencher ( Gene Codes Corporation , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) and compared against A . nidulans FGSC A4 AN1558 ( AspGDID : ASPL0000043272 ) from the Aspergillus genome database . 20 Cloning and overexpression of AN1558 Sequence data identified the gene , AN1558 . This gene was amplified with primers designed to amplify AN1558 , MyoA Forward + 1kb upstream and MyoA Reverse + 1kb downstream ( Table 3 ) , using the A773 wild - type strain as template . This amplicon totaled 6 , 079 bp in size and was amplified through PCR with Thermo Scientific® Phusion High - Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( Waltham , MA USA ) . Since pfu DNA polymerases produce blunt end products , the AN1558 amplicon was A - tailed using Taq DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA , USA ) following amplification . The A - tailed PCR product was then ligated and cloned pGEM® - T Easy Vector ( Promega Corporation , Madison , WI , USA ) using manufacturer’s protocols . The resulting plasmid , pGEM - myoA , was then used to transform both the swoQ mutant and A773 strain . This plasmid was transformed concurrently with the empty vector plasmid , pRG3 - AMA1 , in a co - transformation . As a control both the swoQ mutant and A773 strain were transformed only with the empty vector plasmid . 21 CHAPTER III RESULTS Identification of the swoQ mutant In order to further the current understanding of invasive hyphal growth , this study utilized a forward genetic approach to identify genes involved in polarization . The tsC - 47 strain was selected for this study from a collection of TS mutants because of its polarity phenotype at the restrictive temperature , 42ºC . In order to determine if the mutant allele found in tsC - 47 occurs at a single locus , ascospores from an outcross between the tsC - 47 and A773 strains were examined . A . nidulans is haploid , therefore a single gene mutation is expected to segregate 1 : 1 in crosses with wild - type . Progeny from this cross resulted in a mutant to wild - type segregation ratio of 94 : 92 ( n = 186 ) , where the swo mutation was found in 50 . 54 % of progeny . A chi - square ( χ 2 ) goodness - of - fit test and a two - tailed test revealed that this result has a χ 2 of . 022 with one degree of freedom , and a p - value of . 8834 . By conventional criteria and a level of significance where α = . 05 , this difference is considered to not be statistically significant and does not differ significantly from the theoretical distribution . This result indicates the swo mutation segregates as one locus in the tsC - 47 strain and because of this the mutation carried by this strain will referred to as swoQ hereafter . 22 The swoQ phenotype The swoQ mutant was selected for this study because of its TS polarity phenotype . At the permissive temperature , 30ºC , this mutant grows as wild - type ( Figure 1 and 2 ) . While at the restrictive temperature , 42ºC , this strain displays a prominent TS polarity defect , as evidenced by the presence of abnormally swollen cells , uneven diameter hyphae , enlarged vacuoles , and an abnormal distribution of nuclei ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) . The hyphal diameter of this strain ranges from the typical 3 µ m to 35 µ m , where x ̅ = 15 µm and n = 604 following a 12 hour incubation at 42ºC . Following an 11 hour incubation at the restrictive temperature , 44 . 4 % of swoQ cells displayed the swollen cell polarity phenotype , 24 . 3 % of cells grew as wild - type , and 31 . 3 % did not germinate ( n = 304 ) , in comparison A773 had 80 . 2 % of cells germinate ( n = 258 ) . In order assess whether polar growth could be lost following a temperature shift , swoQ mutant cells were incubated for 11 hours at the 30ºC , then upshifted to the 42ºC for 5 hours . Following this incubation time , 40 . 2 % of growing hyphae observed ( n = 250 ) lost polarization and began to swell apically ( Figure 3 ) . The remaining 32 % of cells appeared as wild - type ( Figure 3 ) . In order to determine if polar growth can be recovered following a downshift in temperature , swoQ mutant cells were grown at 42ºC for 11 hours then transferred to 30ºC for 5 hours . Following this incubation protocol , it was observed that swoQ germlings were able to re - initiate polar growth resulting in multiple new sites of growth on each germling . swoQ germlings are able to establish multiple sites of growth , where 61 % of cells have 3 to 4 polarization sites , 12 % have 5 or greater , and the remaining 27 % possessed 1 to 2 polarization sites ( n = 150 ) ( Figure 4 ) . 23 Figure 1 . swoQ displays aberrant growth at the restrictive temperature . TS mutant , swoQ displays a near normal phenotype at 30 ° C while at 42 ° C the mutant displays defective polarized growth . The swoQ mutant was grown for 12 hours at the restrictive temperature then imaged with DIC on agar blocks . ( A ) The swoQ strain grown at the permissive temperature . This temperature allows the mutant to develop a phenotype similar to WT and hyphae with a consistent diameter of 15 µm .

Polarized growth in the swoQ mutant is lost when shifted from the permissive temperature to the restrictive temperature . ( A ) The swoQ mutant was grown for 11 hours at 30ºC . ( B ) The swoQ mutant was grown for 11 hours at 30ºC then shifted to 42ºC for a 5 hour incubation . Polar growth is lost in 40 . 2 % of upshifted swoQ strains . These strains loose polarization and begin to swell , as indicated by arrows . Scale bar = 10 µm . Figure 4 . Multiple germ tubes emerge following a downshift . Cells were grown at the restrictive temperature for 11 hours then shifted to the permissive temperature for 5 hour in order to determine if polarized growth can be restored . ( A ) The swoQ mutant was grown for 11 hours at 42ºC . ( B ) The swoQ mutant was grown for 11 hours at 42ºC then shifted to 42ºC for a 5 hours incubation . Scale bar = 10 µm . 26 Polarized growth in swoQ mutant is restored by pRG3 - 47 - 1 The tsC - 47 strain was transformed with the pRG3 - AMA1 genomic library in order to identify a plasmid which contained a genomic insert capable of restoring polarized growth to swoQ ( Table 2 ) . Transformants were screened for the restoration of wild - type like growth at the restrictive temperature and pyrimidine ( pyrG ) prototrophy on minimal medium . In this screen 1 , 400 prototrophic transformants were observed but only one transformant displayed wild - type like growth at the restrictive temperature . The library plasmid responsible for restoring polarized growth to the transformed swoQ strain was isolated by transforming competent bacterial cells with genomic DNA from the transformants of interest . Library plasmid pRG3 - 47 - 3 - 1 ( Table 2 ) was recovered and re - introduced into the swoQ mutant which confirmed this plasmid restores growth to the swoQ mutant at 42 ° C ( Figure 5 ) . The genomic insert of the rescued plasmid , pRG3 - 47 - 3 - 1 , was sequenced using vector specific primers , M13 and RG3 ( Table 3 ) . Analysis of sequence data from this set of reactions revealed the location of the genomic insert in pRG3 - 47 - 3 - 1 was not found in the MCS as anticipated , but rather located inside of pyr4 , this result is further detailed in Figure 6 , due to an as yet uncharacterized recombination event with in the plasmid . The full sequence of the genomic insert was obtained by comparing pRG3 - 47 - 3 - 1 sequence data to the NCBI database using blastn ( 86 ) . End sequence belonging to the genomic insert of pRG3 - 47 - 3 - 1 was shown to possess 1 , 058 nucleotides of coding sequencing belonging to myoA ( AN1558 ) , a putative myosin I required for secretion and polarized growth ( Figure 6 ) . 27 Figure 5 . pRG347 - 3 - 1 restores polarized growth to swoQ transformants . The genomic library plasmid , pRG3 - 47 - 3 - 1 , rescues the swoQ mutant phenotype .

This amplicon was ligated into the vector ; the resulting plasmid was named pGEM - myoA ( Table 2 ) and was co - transformed with pRG3 - AMA1 - NotI into the swoQ mutant . Transformants were then screened for restored pyrG prototrophy and restored polarized growth . Microscopic observations of swoQ mutants transformed with pGEM - myoA showed restored polarized growth at 42ºC ( Figure 7 ) . PCR with vector specific primers , T7 and SP6 ( Table 3 ) , was used to confirm if transformants possessed pGEM - myoA ( Figure 8 ) . Conidia of each strain was harvested and diluted to a concentration of 103 spores / µ l ; 10 µ l of this solution was placed in the center of a solid media plate and incubated at 30°C for five days . Following incubation , the diameter of colonies was measured on 2 axes , imaged ( Figure 9 ) and the mean diameter of each strain recorded in Table 4 . This examination was revealed a significant difference between the swoQ mutant , swoQ transformed with the pRG3 - 47 - 1 , and swoQ - myoA . The mean colony diameter observed for each strain at the 30ºC and 42ºC are as follows , respectively : A773 wild - type strain was 510 mm and 440 mm in size , swoQ was 520mm and 220mm , swoQ - pRG3 - 47 - 1 was 540 mm and 385 mm , and swoQ - myoA was 525 mm and 450mm ( Table 5 ) . Statistical methods were used in order to determine if there was a significant difference between the mean diameter of the swoQ mutant ( µ q ) at 42ºC and the mean diameter of the 30 swoQ - myoA strain ( µ m ) . To test this the difference , the null hypothesis ( H 0 ) , where the difference between µ m and µ q equals 0 ( H 0 = µ m - µ q = 0 ) , was compared against the alternative hypothesis H a , where the difference between µ m and µ q is greater than 0 ( H a = µ m - µ q ≤ 0 ) . A two tailed t - test returned a p - value of . 0031 , based on the means of the swoQ mutant and the swoQ - myoA strain . By conventional criteria and a level of significance of . 05 the difference is consistent with the null hypothesis and therefore found to be statistically significant indicating that addition of a wild - type copy of myoA in swoQ has the ability to restore polarized growth to the mutant strain . Following assessment of the colony phenotype , conidia were collected with 2 mL of sterile water and quantified using a hemocytometer . A similar statistical approach as described in the preceding paragraph was used to assess conidia production . Conidia production was assessed between the swoQ mutant , wild - type , swoQ - myoA and A773 - myoA strains ( Table 5 ) . This examination revealed the mean of conidia produced by the swoQ strain was 64 . 25 x 10 6 at 30ºC but only 9 . 20 x 10 2 at 42ºC . A two tailed t - test revealed a p - value of less than . 0001 , which by conventional criteria ⍺ = . 05 this difference is statistically significant . A statistically significant difference was found between the conidia production of the swoQ mutant and the conidia production of the swoQ - myoA strain . The p - value for this paired t - test was found to be . 0371 which by conventional criteria and a level of significance where α = . 05 , this difference is considered to be statistically significant . Conidia were collected from each strain as described above , and quantified ( Table 9 ) . 31 Figure 7 . A sub - clone of myoA restores polarization to swoQ mutant .

The myoA gene found in swoQ mutant was amplified using primers , MyoA + 1kb up and MyoA + 1kb down ( Table 3 ) . This PCR amplicon was then cloned into the pGEM - T easy vector system . The resulting plasmid was named pGEM - swoQ - myoA ( Table 2 ) . The insert was sequenced using 14 myoA specific primers ( Table 3 ) . Analysis of the sequence data revealed that the myoA allele amplified from the tsC - 47 strain contains no mutant lesions and it is likely that the swoQ mutant lesion is elsewhere in the genome . Overexpression of myoA leads to hyper - branching phenotype The plasmid , pGEM - myoA , contains a sub - clone of wild - type myoA . This plasmid was used to overexpress AN1558 in wild - type and to determine if AN1558 is responsible for the polarization phenotype seen in the swoQ - myoA mutant . pGEM - myoA was co - transformed with pRG3 - AMA1 - NotI into wild - type strain , A773 , in order to observe the resulting phenotype outside of the swoQ mutant . Transformants were then screened for restored pyrG prototrophy and observed microscopically for a polarization phenotype ( Figure 10 ) . Observations of the A773 + extra copy myoA strain recovered from this transformation exhibited a hyper - branching phenotype at both 30ºC and 42ºC ( Figure 10 ) . Conidia production of the A773 + extra copy myoA was assessed in order to determine if there was a fitness cost for carrying the pGEM - myoA and pRG3 - AMA1 - NotI plasmids ( Table 5 ) . Genomic DNA belonging to this strain was isolated and PCR verification served 35 to determine that the strain indeed possessed the pGEM - myoA plasmid ( Figure 8 ) . Hyper - branching in the A773 + extra copy myoA strain was quantified alongside swoQ - myoA , A773 , and swoQ ( Table 10 ) . A two - tailed t - test was performed in order to evaluate the difference of means between strains ( Table 6 ) . When compared to wild - type , mutants carrying an extra copy of myoA were found to vary significantly above the mean and possessed a p - value < . 0001 at both 42ºC and 30ºC . Figure 10 .

The markers followed in this experiment are wA , argB , pyroA4 , wetA , and are found on chromosomes II , III , IV and VII , respectively . The progeny from this cross ( n = 51 ) were genotyped for each nutritional marker ( argB , pyroA4 ) by replica plating on to various plates each devoid of a different nutritional marker and assessing strains for prototrophy . The swoQ genotype was examined by screening for the TS polarity phenotype . This involved replica plating the progeny on to two solid plates of MM plates containing all supplements and then incubating strains at either 30ºC or 42ºC . The aconidial phenotype of the wetA marker was assessed by plating strains at 30ºC on solid CM plates and screening for the “wet” phenotype associated with this allele . 37 The phenotype of each of the offspring was recorded and the segregation ratio between recombinants and parental alleles were assessed ( Table 7 ) . The segregation ratio of recombinants to parental alleles was used to determine if swoQ was found within 50 map units on chromosomes II , III , IV and VII . If one of the assessed markers is found on the same chromosome as swoQ then the segregation ratio would deviate significantly from 1 : 1 . The segregation ratios observed between the swoQ and the wA allele was 21 : 22 , swoQ and the argB allele was 24 : 27 , swoQ and the pyroA4 allele was 30 : 21 , swoQ and the wetA allele was 25 : 26 . Based on these data suggests the swoQ allele was found not to be linked to the 4 markers assessed in this study . Table 7 .

These makers included : FimA : : GFP , Exo84 : : GFP , DnfA and DnfB . These markers were added to the swoQ strain in a sexual cross with the GFP strain of interest . Examination of swoQ FimA : : GFP , at the permissive temperature has a localization similar to wild - type where FimA : : GFP is enriched in the subapical collar of growing hyphae and in septa of A . nidulans , while at the restrictive temperature in swoQ , FimA : : GFP displays diffuse localization throughout the hypha in comparison to wild - type ( Figure 11 ) . At the permissive temperature and in wild - type , Exo84 : : GFP localizes to the apical dome of growing hyphae . In contrast , at the restrictive temperature in the swoQ mutant , Exo84 : : GFP mislocalizes and appears as an amorphous matrix throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 12 ) . In wild - type DnfA localizes to the apical PM in growing cells . In the swoQ mutant , DnfA was found to also localize to the apical PM but the signal is more diffuse in hyphal tips in comparison to wild - type ( Figure 13 ) . In this study DnfB was observed in the swoQ mutant and was found to localize to the cortex of swelling cells , while in wild - type the DnfB : : GFP signal was observed to localize at a compact loci just behind the cell tip at the center of the DnfA apical structure ( Figure 14 ) . 39 Figure 11 .

The cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in the transport of secretory and endocytic vesicles in the apex of the cell . These processes are governed by MTs and F - actin and their corresponding motor proteins : kinesin , dynein , and myosin . Class I myosins , are involved in cytoskeleton - membrane interactions and we speculate they play a role in both exocytosis and endocytosis . Previous studies have established that MyoA is an important player in polarized growth and is essential in A . nidulans ( 60 ) . In this study I examined the role of MyoA and affirmed its importance in hyphal growth by demonstrating it has a polarization affect on hyphae and that overexpression of this protein has the ability to suppress the swoQ polarity defect . The work described here was designed to identify genes involved in polar growth . The tsC - 47 strain , swoQ , was selected from a previously generated collection of A . nidulans TS mutants for further study because of its swollen cell polarity defect . Temperature - shift experiments showed that polar growth in the swoQ mutant is lost following an upshift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature , and is able to recover polar growth following a downshift from the restrictive to the permissive temperature . A genetic cross between swoQ and wild - type revealed that the mutant allele found in swoQ occurs at a single locus and segregates 1 : 1 . The swoQ strain was transformed with the pRG3 - AMA1 genomic library in order to identify a plasmid which contained a genomic insert capable of restoring polarized growth to swoQ . The plasmid 42 identified , pRG3 - 47 - 1 , restored polarized growth to the swoQ strain . The genomic insert of this plasmid was sequenced and found to encode MyoA . Following this result , the myoA gene in the swoQ mutant was sequenced in order to determine if the mutant lesion was contained in this gene . No lesions were found in the myoA gene in swoQ , suggesting that the mutant defect is likely found elsewhere in the mutant genome . A sub - clone of myoA was transformed into swoQ and was found to restore polarized growth and induce branching in the swoQ mutant . Similarly , a sub - clone of myoA was transformed into the wild - type strain and was also found to induce hyper - branching . Interestingly , the polarity defect in swoQ was rescued when transformed with an extra copy of myoA , even though this gene carried no lesion in swoQ . Taken together these data suggest that myoA has a polarization affect on cells allowing MyoA to suppress the mutant allele in swoQ . This effect is epistatic and could be explained in a variety of ways . For example , the masking effect of myoA on swoQ could be explained if the defect is found in an unrelated gene , this gene could encode an exocyst component where a defect in an exocyst gene could induce hyper - secretion , and overexpression of MyoA causes the strain to hyper - branch which could compensate for the defect . This phenomenon could also be explained if the swoQ mutant is defective in a closely related gene , like another myosin or other cytoskeletal element , allowing the overexpression of myoA in swoQ to overcome the defect . Previous examinations of MyoA determined that the protein localizes to the sub - apical collar of hyphae . At the collar , MyoA is presumed to work alongside FimA to in order to nucleate actin and form actin patches . Together these proteins provide the driving force for invagination of the membrane and facilitate endocytosis . The polarity phenotype 43 observed in the swoQ strain is consistent with previous investigations of endocytic proteins . The MyoA ortholog , Myo - 1 , has been shown to be an endocytic protein in N . crassa . The Δ myo - 1 mutant in N . crassa shares a similar phenotype to swoQ , where both strains display a meandering appearance and a loss of polarization . I hypothesize swoQ to also be involved in this process , as evidenced by Figure 2 , where FM4 - 64 internalization was altered in the swoQ mutant relative to wild - type . In order to test this hypothesis and gain insight on how swoQ interacts with other proteins in the current A . nidulans growth model the swoQ mutant strain was crossed with a variety of polarity markers . The polarity markers assessed in this study were FimA , an actin cross - linking protein , Exo84 , a component of the exocyst complex , and the flippases DnfA and DnfB which localize to secretory vesicles and play a role in asymmetrical distribution of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine at the tip . This examination revealed that swoQ has an affect on the localization of FimA : : GFP and a major effect on the localization of Exo84 : : GFP in vivo ( Figure 11 and Figure 12 ) . In order to interpret data obtained from these experiments , these observations were integrated into the A . nidulans growth model ( Figure 15 ) . Previous studies have determined the role various myosins have on fungal growth , however , an all - encompassing model describing how the cytoskeleton and myosin motor proteins cooperate with endocytic and exocytic machinery to facilitate apical recycling , has yet to be described . Due the lack of this model , I built one for this study in order to understand how MyoA overexpression restores polarized growth to swoQ ( Figure 15 ) . This model summarizes the various functions of the five myosins currently described in 44 A . nidulans . These five myosins belong to four classes ( I , II , V , XVII ) and each plays a different role in growth . Class I myosins , like MyoA , are responsible for exocytosis and endocytosis . MyoA has been shown to localize to sites of endocytosis where it interacts with the actin network to facilitate the formation of actin patches . Localization studies show MyoA is found at the sub - apical collar , a region of the cell associated with actin patch formation and endocytosis ( 60 ) . Fimbrin and actin , share a similar localization pattern and likely work with MyoA to cross - link actin filaments in order to invaginate the membrane ( Figure 15 ) ( 15 ) . Class V myosins , like MyoE , are required for trafficking vesicles in an actin - dependent manner ( 52 ) . In A . nidulans , MyoE localizes to moving puncta in the cytoplasm and SPK . This protein is likely involved in moving vesicles to the SPK . In yeast , class V myosins have been shown to be involved the transport of mRNA transcripts , mRNPs , some exocyst components , and post – Golgi vesicles ( 87 ) . Yet these roles are not known in A . nidulans . The class II myosin , MyoB , has been shown to localize to septa to form septal rings and is implicated in cytokinesis and septum formation ( 52 ) . A . nidulans possesses two class XVII myosins , CsmA and CsmB . This class of myosins is specific to fungi and possesses both a myosin motor domain and a chitin synthase domain ( 88 ) . Data suggests that these myosins play a role in exocytosis by transporting chitin synthase - attached vesicles to the growth region ( 88 , 89 ) . The localization of CsmA and CsmB at hyphal tips , is dependent on an actin - binding motor domain which is implicated in the delivery of secretory vesicles at the tip . The exact mechanism which CsmA and CsmB utilizes to coordinate the delivery of secretory vesicles is unclear . 45 Figure 15 . Contribution of various myosins on vesicle trafficking and growth . ( A ) An overview of a hypothetical hyphal apex displays the cytoskeleton and various motor proteins participating in polarized growth . Two different types of motor proteins interact with MTs ( green and blue chains ) : kinesin ( green motor protein ) and dynein ( red motor protein ) . Five different myosin motor proteins ( various shades of blue ) , which bind to actin ( red chains ) , have been identified in A . nidulans . These myosins maintain polarized growth by facilitating both endocytosis and exocytosis . MyoA ( cyan ) localizes at the subapical collar and is associated with the nucleation of actin which stimulates the formation of the actin network ( tan spheres and green square ) and patch formation ( red web ) around sites of endocytosis . Endocytic vesicles fuse with endosomes ( purple oval ) . Molecules delivered to endosomes are either recycled back to Golgi ( purple rings ) or continue on to lysosomes . MyoE ( light blue ) localizes to moving puncta in the cytoplasm and SPK ( large collection of white , red , and green spheres ) . This myosin is required for trafficking vesicles ( white spheres ) along the actin cytoskeleton and bringing secretory vesicles to the tip . The exocyst complex ( collection of multicolored pill - shaped proteins ) is an octameric protein complex located at the tip of the cell which tethers secretory vesicles to the PM prior to vesicle fusion . It is hypothesized that some exocyst components , like Exo84 ( green sphere ) , are transported by MyoE along this machinery following exit from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( pastel blue globular cisternae with small green ribosomes ) . v - SNAREs ( purple wavy line ) found on the secretory vesicles interact with t - SNAREs ( blue and green wavy line ) at the PM to mediate vesicle fusion . MyoB ( dark Blue ) localizes to septa and is implicated in cytokinesis and septum formation . Class XVII myosins , CsmA and CsmB ( cobalt blue ) , possesses both a myosin motor domain and a chitin synthase domain and are associated with chitin deposition and delivery of chitosomes at the apex . It is hypothesized , CsmA is transported to the tip on a hypothetical kinesin then the CsmA myosin motor domain binds to actin facilitating a switch from the MT cytoskeleton . 46 Figure 15 . Continued . ( B ) An overview of a hypothetical swoQ hyphal apex . The swoQ mutant displays a defect in polarized growth ( misshaped hyphae ) which contributes to disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and an inability to traffic the Exo84 exocyst component ( green sphere ) to the tip of the cell . Due a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton ( red chains are jagged , broken and disconnected ) the SPK is disordered ( disorganized collection of vesicles in tip ) . Due to the observed localization pattern of Exo84 in the swoQ mutant , it is hypothesized that secretion of this protein is blocked and unable to exit the ER following synthesis by the ribosomes ( green spheres overlapping pastel blue globular cisternae ) . It is hypothesized traffic of this protein is disrupted from the ER due to a mutant version of MyoE ( swoQ - MyoE ) ( light blue and misshaped version of MyoE which is missing a motor domain and possesses an abnormal cargo binding domain ) . It is hypothesized that mislocalization of Exo84 in swoQ would lead to a disruption in the exocyst complex ( disordered collection of multi - colored pill - shaped proteins at tip of cell ) . FimA ( neon green squares ) displays diffuse localization throughout the cortex in the swoQ mutant and is unable to assemble a well - defined sub - apical collar ( scattered and diffuse actin towards cell periphery ) . Which is a phenotype similar to the N . crassa Δ myo - 1 mutant . Together these observations suggest that the “swo” phenotype is attributed to the loss of exocyst function and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . 47 Figure 15 . Continued . ( C ) Overexpression of MyoA restores polarized growth to the swoQ mutant . An excess of MyoA in the cell ( cyan myosin found throughout the cell ) allows the swoQ to overcome its growth defect ( evenly shaped hyphae ) by rescuing the function of the exocyst complex and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Excessive expression of MyoA assists ( cyan MyoA binds to vesicles and moves along actin filament ) the defective protein , swoQ - MyoE ( light blue and misshaped version of MyoE ) , by aiding in the transport of components needed for growth toward the tip . With the help of MyoA the secretion of Exo84 ( green sphere ) in the swoQ mutant is no longer blocked and the exocyst protein is able to exit the ER ( via MyoA ) . Since Exo84 is able to associate with the rest of the exocyst complex the complex is no longer disrupted ( organized collection of multi - colored pill - shaped proteins at the tip of the cell ) . Extra MyoA is hypothesized to assist in the nucleation of actin in the mutant which leads to the restoration of the actin network ( tan spheres and neon green fimbrin square ) , the assembly of actin patches ( red web ) around sites of endocytosis ( leading to a well - defined sub - apical collar , red blocks ) , and the organization of actin filaments ( red chains ) . The presence of an organized actin cytoskeleton rescues the disrupted supply of vesicles at the tip of the cell leading to the formation of a well - organized SPK . 48 The delivery of CsmA at the tip is MT dependent , presumably facilitated by an unknown kinesin motor , and that the myosin motor domain acts an anchor at the tip ( Figure 15 ) ( 18 , 88 , 90 ) . FimA and Exo84 are involved in polarized growth and when grown at 42ºC the localization of these polarity proteins are mislocalized in the swoQ mutant ( Figure 11 and Figure 14 ) . The localization of these proteins in both wild - type and the mutant is outlined in the Myosin growth model ( Figure 15 ) . The exocyst complex component , Exo84 , localizes to the apical dome in wild - type , while in the swoQ mutant Exo84 appears as an amorphous matrix . This matrix is consistent with the shape of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) in fungi ( Figure 11 ) . Due to the observed localization pattern of Exo84 and the swoQ phenotype , I speculate that secretion of this protein is blocked and is unable to exit the ER following synthesis by ribosomes . Exo84 remains in the ER due an uncharacterized block in exit from the ER . In addition to the mislocalization of Exo84 , FimA displays diffuse localization throughout the cortex in the swoQ mutant and in comparison to wild - type is unable to assemble a well - defined sub - apical collar . Together these observations suggest that the “swo” phenotype is attributed to the loss of exocyst function and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Accumulation of Exo84 in the ER suggests that swoQ may encode a protein associated with the trafficking of secretory vesicles from the ER to the SPK . This is consistent with previous evidence found in nerve cells where class V myosins transport vesicles from the ER in an actin dependent manner ( 91 , 92 ) . A similar protein would be necessary in A . nidulans in order to transport vesicles from the ER . This hypothesized protein is likely related to MyoE , a class V myosin involved in the secretion , 49 which possesses a deletion phenotype similar to the swoQ mutant ( 52 ) . This theory is supported by the fact that MyoA is involved in secretion and overexpression of this protein is capable of overcoming the swoQ polarity defect . I hypothesize that overexpression of MyoA is suppressing a mutation in another myosin , possibly MyoE . Overexpression of MyoA would increase secretion in the swoQ mutant which would compensate for the lack of this hypothesized myosin protein and overcome the observed exocytosis defect . Future directions These data suggest that the mutant allele found in swoQ inhibits proper exocytosis . The abnormal localization pattern of FimA and Exo84 in the swoQ mutant suggests the transport of secretory vesicles from the ER is blocked due to an unknown defect in swoQ . Identification of the gene encoded by swoQ is necessary to better understand the transport of secretory vesicles and exocytosis during polarized growth . In the previous section I described how overexpression of MyoA is able to suppress the swoQ mutation which is likely found in another myosin , most likely MyoE . In order to test this hypothesis , I need to sub - clone and sequence a copy of the myoE gene found in the swoQ mutant . This experiment will aid in determining if swoQ possesses a mutant copy of myoE . If the swoQ strain is found to possess a mutant copy of myoE , I can proceed by seeing if a wild - type copy of this gene can complement the swoQ polarity defect . If a mutant lesion is not found to be encoded within myoE and swoQ is found to possess a wild - type copy of this gene , the scope of this experiment can be broadened to include myoB , csmA , and csmB . These other myosins can be sub - cloned and sequenced in 50 order to identify the defective gene . If this broad examination of myosins in swoQ does not identify the mutant allele , I can follow up this experiment by revisiting the forward genetic approach used to identify MyoA as a suppressor . The s woQ gene was not identified in this forward genetic screen but instead an extragenic suppressor was identified . A library plasmid which complements swoQ was not identified in this initial screen due to the small sample size of screened transformants , where only 1 , 400 prototrophic transformants were examined in this study . This small sample size could account for an incomplete representation of the genomic library . In order to ensure full representation of the library a large number of transformants needs to be screened . The library used in this study contained 3 , 333 different types of plasmids and in order to ensure at least 90 % of the plasmid types in the mixture are represented I would need to screen ~ 10 , 000 transformants ( 93 ) . By recovering more transformants , I would ensure full representation of the genomic library and likely identify swoQ . In the event that swoQ is not represented in the genomic library , another way to identify the mutant allele in swoQ is through mitotic mapping . Unlike meiotic mapping , where the genetic linkage of widely separated genes is difficult to establish , mitotic mapping can be used to determine on which chromosome swoQ resides and determine the linkage of genes which are far apart on the same chromosome ( 77 ) . The first step in mitotically mapping involves the formation of a diploid . To make a diploid swoQ , a heterokaryon needs to be formed with a mapping strain with a screenable nutritional marker on each chromosome . Through an uncharacterized mechanism , diploid condia are spontaneously formed . This diploid can then be isolated . Through parasexual genetics 51 haploidized diploids will be screened in order to trace which genes are linked and which genes sort independently . Mitotic disjunction makes heterozygous genes distal to the crossover homozygous , therefore the frequencies of different homozygous classes can be used to determine gene order and the relative map distance between swoQ other markers in the experiment . Once the chromosomal location of swoQ is determined , this data can then be compared to a chromosome map and by looking at the region A . nidulans reference genome an informed decision can be made to determine which genes should be analyzed further in order to determine what gene swoQ encodes . A more straightforward approach for identifying the mutant defect in swoQ would entail sequencing the entire genome of the mutant . Next - generation sequencing would allow for me to map the entire genome of swoQ in search for the mutant allele . Since many single nucleotide polymorphisms could be present in the laboratory strain , a backcross to the wild - type strain is necessary to get rid of uncharacterized mutations . Progeny from this cross , displaying the swoQ phenotype can then be sequenced . The sequence reads generated from whole genome sequencing would then be aligned to the A . nidulans reference genome . Concatenated sequence data can then be used to directly compare the swoQ mutant to the wild - type reference genome in order to reveal the exact polymorphism contributing to the observed polarity defect . Once swoQ is identified , I would like to examine how swoQ plays into the current growth model . To do this I would first examine the localization of the protein encoded by swoQ protein using GFP , and determine examine how it associates with other proteins . The first proteins I would colocalize alongside SwoQ : : GFP would be MyoA . Since swoQ 52 is thought to encode another myosin colocalization with MyoA inside of both wild - type and complemented mutant would likely reveal how MyoA overexpression is able to compensate the defect . Results from this experiment could provide a better understanding of the role of MyoA in secretion and how SwoQ cooperates with other myosins to facilitate polarized growth . In A . nidulans it is currently poorly understood how proteins are trafficked from the ER , and what cytoskeletal elements these secretory proteins utilize during transit proteins . Based on the data examined in this study , SwoQ plays a role in the secretion of Exo84 from the ER . The mechanism behind secretion from the ER can be elucidated in future studies of SwoQ . By tracing the localization of SwoQ : : GFP at the ER and then colocalizing this protein alongside ActA : : GFP a connection between actin and SwoQ can be formed . I hypothesize SwoQ can be visualized carrying cargo along actin filaments from the ER . The localization of Exo84 from the ER can be compared to SwoQ : : GFP in order to determine if this exocyst component is cargo of SwoQ . The experiments conducted in this study revealed an interesting association between myosin motor proteins and exocytosis from the ER . Currently this process is not fully understood in A . nidulans and the experiments proposed in this study have the potential to decipher the mechanism involved in secretion from the ER and will better the understanding of how polarized growth is maintained in A . nidulans . 53 REFERENCES 1 .
