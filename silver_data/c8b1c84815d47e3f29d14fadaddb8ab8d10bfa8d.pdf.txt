We modeled how the elongation rate depends on the concentrations of proﬁlin and actin for four dif - ferent formins . We assume that ( 1 ) FH2 domains are in rapid equilibrium among conformations that block or allow actin addition and that ( 2 ) proﬁlin - actin is trans - ferred rapidly to the barbed end from multiple proﬁlin binding sites in formin FH1 domains . In agreement with previous experiments discussed below , we ﬁnd an optimal proﬁlin concentration with a maximal elon - gation rate that can exceed the rate of actin alone . High proﬁlin concentrations suppress elongation , largely because free proﬁlin displaces proﬁlin - actin from FH1 . The model supports a common polymerization mechanism for the four formin FH1FH2 constructs with differences attributed to varying parameter values . The mechanism does not require ATP hydroly - sis by polymerized actin , but we cannot exclude that formins accelerate hydrolysis . Introduction Formins nucleate actin ﬁlaments for the cytokinetic ring , ﬁlopodial protrusions , and actin cables and control their growth while remaining processively attached at the barbed end of the ﬁlament ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Evangel - ista et al . , 2002 ; Feierbach and Chang , 2001 ; Higashida et al . , 2004 ; Kobielak et al . , 2004 ; Pellegrin and Mellor , 2005 ; Sagot et al . , 2002 ; Schirenbeck et al . , 2005 ; Sever - son et al . , 2002 ; Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) . Recent crystallo - graphic and biochemical studies have provided detailed information on formin mechanisms . Adjacent formin homology 1 and 2 domains ( FH1 and FH2 ) control growth at the barbed end , whereas other domains are involved in subcellular localization and regulation . The FH2 domain of budding yeast formin Bni1p is a homo - dimer structure that encircles the barbed end of actin ﬁl - aments , presumably as a closed ring ( Figure 1 ) ( Otomo et al . , 2005b ; Xu et al . , 2004 ) . Stretches of polyproline in the FH1 domain are believed to recruit proﬁlin - actin from a large cytoplasmic reservoir for addition to the barbed end . All well - characterized formin FH2 domains interact with the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , but their mechanisms differ quantitatively . Fission yeast formin Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p caps barbed ends , but proﬁlin allows ﬁlament elongation at rates comparable to those of free barbed ends ( Kovar et al . , 2006 , 2003 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . Other formins allow growth at different rates in the absence of proﬁlin ( Harris et al . , 2004 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Moseley et al . , 2004 ; Pring et al . , 2003 ; Pruyne et al . , 2002 ) . In the presence of proﬁlin , ﬁla - ments associated with mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) add Mg - ATP - ac - tin monomers up to ﬁve ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) or 15 times larger ( Romero et al . , 2004 ) than formin - free barbed ends . Even a 5 - fold increase in the rate of elongation is surprising , given that pure actin elongation appears dif - fusion limited ( Drenckhahn and Pollard , 1986 ) . Proﬁlin and ATP - hydrolysis were proposed to be required for processive formin activity ( Romero et al . , 2004 ) . How - ever , experiments with four different formins showed that neither ATP hydrolysis nor proﬁlin is required for processivity ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . Here , we develop a kinetic model of the mechanism of formin FH1FH2 domains based on the transfer of actin subunits from the FH1 domain to the barbed end medi - ated by proﬁlin ( Figure 1A ) . This model accounts for the behavior of all four thoroughly characterized formins ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . We explore if ATP hydrolysis is kinet - ically or thermodynamically required to be part of this conserved mechanism . The model explains how formins with multiple proﬁlin binding sites within FH1 can speed up elongation . The behaviors of various formins are at - tributed to their different parameter values . Many of these parameters are already available from past exper - iments , whereas others are estimated . Certain observa - tions cannot be fully explained by the model ; this could conceivably imply a fully or partially coupled ATP - hydro - lysis mechanism . Results Description of Model and Methods of Solution FH1 : Transfer Mechanism We assume that FH1 domains capture proﬁlin - actin from the bulk solution and transfer the captured subunit to the barbed end of the ﬁlament ( Figure 1A ) . A process of this type was ﬁrst studied theoretically by Dickinson and coworkers ( Dickinson et al . , 2004 ; Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ; Dickinson et al . , 2002 ) within the frame - work of the ‘‘actoclampin motor . ’’ Direct transfer as - sumes that FH1 is easily deformed ( e . g . , a random * Correspondence : bo8 @ columbia . edu ( B .

Unstructured or ‘‘disordered’’ protein regions are common in eukaryotes ( Dyson and Wright , 2005 ) . FH1 could be disordered , because the programs PONDR ( Romero et al . , 2001 ) and GLOBPLOT ( Linding et al . , 2003 ) estimate high propensity for disorder for the FH1 domain of the four formins studied by Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) ( see Figure 1C ) . The four formin FH1 domains in Figure 1C vary in the length and number of proline - rich stretches , separated by proline - poor ‘‘linker’’ stretches . Solution studies ( Pet - rella et al . , 1996 ) and crystal structures ( Mahoney et al . , 1997 , 1999 ) show that eight prolines span the full binding site on proﬁlin . Thus , in Figure 1C , we tentatively identify as proﬁlin binding sites ( green blocks ) those regions that contain at least six prolines within a stretch of eight res - idues . The large variation in the number of sites among different formins supports the absence of a precise FH1 structure ( which , if conserved among formins , would likely lead to similar FH1 compositions ) . Because poly - L - proline peptides adopt the rigid type II helical structure ( persistence length w 60 residues [ Cantor and Schimmel , 1980 ] ) , much of the proposed ﬂexibility must be attributed to the linker regions . Linker regions could also serve as spacers to allow simultaneous bind - ing of many proﬁlin - actin units . The proﬁlin binding sites are likely to differ in afﬁnity because both the nonproline composition and the con - tiguity of prolines vary . Proline hexamers and octamers bind amoeba and human proﬁlin much more weakly than decamers ( Perelroizen et al . , 1994 ; Petrella et al . , 1996 ) , whereas substitution of proline residues by gly - cine or alanine destabilizes binding ( Petrella et al . , 1996 ) . Rather than proﬁlin , parts of FH1 could be spe - ciﬁc to proteins containing WW or SH3 domains ( Chan et al . , 1996 ; Kamei et al . , 1998 ) or to the EVH1 domain of Mena / VASP whose proline - rich regions can also re - cruit proﬁlin ( Smith et al . , 1996 ) . Here , for simplicity , we assume that all proﬁlin or linker sites are identical . The direct transfer of proﬁlin - actin to the barbed end is essential to our mechanism . If instead the proﬁlin binding sites were immobile at ﬁxed locations relative to the barbed end , then transfer would require an actin unit to be released and to then diffuse to the barbed end . Because diffusion in three dimensions is a dilute exploration of space ( de Gennes , 1982 ) , the probability of collision with the barbed end is less than unity ; Figure 1 . Model of Actin Filament Growth Mediated by a Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p Formin Dimer We assume that all formins obey the same mechanism . FH2 domains ( red ) are shown as a dimer encircling the barbed end of the ﬁlament ( blue ) ( Otomo et al . , 2005b ) . The FH1 domain ( black , green ) is shown unstructured with three proﬁlin binding sites ( green ) . In reality , FH1 may be more compact than depicted . We used the PDB entries 1Y64 ( FH2 - actin ) , 2BTF ( proﬁlin - actin ) , and 1CJF ( proﬁlin - poly - proline ) and incorporated the proposed FH2 lasso domain swap ( Otomo et al . , 2005b ) . The ﬁlament model ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) was constructed with FilaSitus . The strained conformation of the tip subunits ( Otomo et al . , 2005b ) is not shown in this coarse - grained picture .

( B ) Mechanism ofFH2 processivity basedon Figure 5of Otomoetal . ( 2005b ) showing FH2 instatespreventing or allowing subunitincorporation and the association or dissociation of an actin subunit . Our model is consistent with this picture , but other mechanisms of FH2 processivity are also conceivable . We assume that FH2 is in rapid equilibrium among its accessible states . FH2 steps are assumed to be uncoupled from hydro - lysis , but we also discuss the effects of a coupled hydrolysis mechanism . ( C ) FH1domainsequencesoffourforminsandputativeproﬁlinbindingsites ( highlighted ) . MostmDia1experimentsofKovaretal . ( 2006 ) involved a deletion of the underlined part of FH1 . Molecular Cell 456 furthermore , the polymerization probability per collision is w 0 . 02 ( Drenckhahn and Pollard , 1986 ) . It would thus be difﬁcult to explain a 5 - fold or more ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) increase in the polymerization rate through such a mechanism ( Dickinson et al . , 2004 , 2002 ) . We cannot , however , exclude the possibility that formins productively interfere with local actin monomer diffusion . FH2 : Processive Movement and Gating Factor p In the absence of proﬁlin , the elongation rate of ﬁlaments associated with Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p and mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) in - creases linearly with actin concentration ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , indicating that FH2 translocation is not rate limit - ing . We thus assume that any FH2 movements are very fast compared to all other rates ( this assumption may break down for large elongation rates ) . In this limit , the only relevant FH2 property is the gating factor p h k B + A = k B + A ; free ; ( 1 ) where k B + A and k B + A ; free are the association rate constants of actin subunits at a formin - associated or formin - free barbed end , respectively , in the absence of proﬁlin . The gating factor is an empirical parameter describing the accessibility of the barbed end for polymerization . Its value originates in the conformations of FH2 at the barbed end , the full ensemble of which is unknown . Otomo et al . ( 2005b ) proposed that the FH2 dimer exists in equilibrium between two states ( Figure 1B ) : ( 1 ) the closed ( or blocked ) conﬁguration that prevents polymer - ization as in the crystal structure of the FH2 - actin com - plex , and ( 2 ) the open ( or accessible ) state that allows actin subunit addition . The transition from the closed to the open state involves movement of the lagging unit of the FH2 dimer toward the barbed end . The poly - merization of one subunit shifts the position of the open - closed equilibrium by one unit forward along the ﬁlament . In so doing , the two members of the FH2 homo - dimer exchange roles . In this model , p would depend on ( 1 ) the opening probability and ( 2 ) the accessibility of actin subunits to the barbed end given an open FH2 state ( Pring et al . , 2003 ) . Before the study of Otomo et al . ( 2005b ) , related FH2 mechanisms were proposed ( Kozlov and Bershadsky , 2004 ; Xu et al . , 2004 ) . Here , we study an uncoupled hydrolysis mechanism . In a more general scheme , certain FH2 steps could be partially or fully coupled to ATP hydrolysis . Kinetic Scheme We model the kinetics as a Markov process involving the states of Figure 2 . Each state is assumed sufﬁciently long lived so that it equilibrates before transition to an - other state . We assume that the rates associated with a given proﬁlin binding site in FH1 are independent of the states of other sites . The elongation rate was evalu - ated by Monte Carlo simulations ( Vavylonis et al . , 2005 ) as a function of total bulk actin and proﬁlin concentra - tions ( Supplemental Data ) . We assume that only one proﬁlin can bind to the FH2 - associated barbed end , because this would be consis - tent with the FH2 model of Otomo et al . ( 2005b ) . By su - perposing crystal structures of proﬁlin - actin ( Schutt et al . , 1993 ) and FH2 - actin ( Otomo et al . , 2005b ) , we found no steric constraints preventing the binding of proﬁlin to the leading actin subunit of an FH2 - associated barbed end , in either the proposed closed or open FH2 states . The binding of proﬁlin to the second actin sub - unit , however , is prohibited due to steric hindrance by the ﬁrst subunit in both open and closed conﬁgurations . Thus , in Figure 2A , proﬁlin is shown to bind only the ter - minal actin subunit , and its binding does not inﬂuence the FH2 open - closed transitions . Similarly to bare barbed ends , we assume that the afﬁnity of proﬁlin for the FH2 - associated end is smaller than that for free actin ( Kang et al . , 1999 ) . The full scheme consists of the following three pro - cesses whose rates are shown in Figure 2A where c A , c p , and c PA are concentrations of actin , proﬁlin , and pro - ﬁlin - actin , respectively . Association of Proﬁlin and Actin onto FH1 Rate constants are indicated by superscript F . I 4 II : pro - ﬁlin binds to , or dissociates from , a site on one of the two FH1 domains of the formin homodimer . II 4 III : binding or dissociation of actin to the proﬁlin - FH1 complex . I 4 III : direct binding or dissociation of proﬁlin - actin complex onto FH1 . FH1 Ring Opening / Closing—Transfer of Actin to the Barbed End and Dissociation of FH1 The binding of FH1 - associated proﬁlin - actin to the barbed end generates a closed ring , and we refer to this process as ‘‘FH1 ring closing’’ ( not to be confused with the FH2 open / closed transitions ) . III 4 IV : the proﬁ - lin - actin - FH1 complex at the n th FH1 site associates or dissociates at the barbed end . IV 4 V : association or dis - sociation of proﬁlin - FH1 complex at the barbed end . IV 4 VI : association or dissociation of FH1 to the barbed end without dissociation of proﬁlin from the barbed end . For simplicity , the ring opening rates are assumed to be independent of n ; this assumption is consistent with de - tailed balance constraints , see below . Direct , Non - FH1 - Mediated , Polymerization Rate constants are indicated by label B for ‘‘bulk . ’’ I 4 VII : free actin associates ( or dissociates ) directly from the bulk to the barbed end . I 4 VI : association and dissociation of proﬁlin - actin . VI 4 VII : association and dissociation of proﬁlin to the barbed end . Four Polymerization Paths Figure 2D shows that bulk actin monomers can arrive at the formin - associated barbed end through four path - ways ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) : Path 1 : proﬁlin - actin associ - ation to FH1 ; Path 2 : free actin association to proﬁlin - FH1 ; Path 3 : direct ( non - FH1 - mediated ) proﬁlin - actin association to the barbed end ; Path 4 : direct free actin association to the barbed end . Detailed Balance : Constraints on Rate Constants Detailed balance in equilibrium requires that the product of the forward rates in an equilibrated chemical cycle moving along the clockwise direction is equal to the anti - clockwise product . This condition implies con - straints on the values of rate constants even in nonequi - librium situations ( Hill , 1988 ) . Figure 2A has four inde - pendent cycles producing the constraints shown in the Supplemental Data as expressions for rate constants that are not readily available from the literature ; these constants are indicated in Figure 2A by green arrows . Model of Formin - Associated Actin Elongation 457 In the absence of a free energy source such as ATP hydrolysis , a protein associated with the ﬁlament tip does not change the critical concentration ( Hill and Kirschner , 1983 ) : k B 2 A = k B + A = k B 2 A ; free = k B + A ; free h c critA ; ( 2 ) where k B 2 A and k B 2 A , free are the dissociation rate con - stants of actin from a formin - associated or formin - free barbed end , respectively , and c critA is the critical concen - tration of a ‘‘pure’’ ATP - actin polymerization ( or of ADP - actin for polymerization in ADP ) . When the free actin concentration becomes c critA , detailed balance ensures zero elongation rate along any path . FH1 Ring Closing The transfer mechanism suggests that the association rate of an actin subunit bound at the n th proline - rich site is proportional to the local concentration , c local ( n ) , at the barbed end : r + PAF ð n Þ z 3 pk B + A ; free c local ð n Þ ; ( 3 ) where 3 describes the enhancement or reduction of ori - entational alignment of actin by FH1 . Because the local concentration can exceed the bulk concentration by a factor of 10 6 , ring closure rates can vastly exceed the polymerization rate of pure actin , k B + A ; free c A , even when the gating factor is small . Assuming that FH1 is a random coil of root mean square size scaling as n 1 / 2 , one has c local w n 2 3 = 2 leading to the simple estimate : r + PAF ð n Þ z r 0 pn 2 3 = 2 ; ( 4 ) where r 0 is a microscopic rate into which all orientational effects have been collapsed . Association rates of the two ends of unfolded peptides are w 10 7 s 2 1 for pep - tides of 10 – 100 residues in length ( Krieger et al . , 2005 ; Lapidus et al . , 2000 ) . Taking into account the value of k B + A ; free and the stiffness of the proline - rich stretches , we estimate r 0 is in the m s - ms range . ( Cyclization kinetics of long ﬂexible polymers involve time - dependent rate constants reﬂecting the polymer chain relaxation dy - namics . Equation 4 is consistent with the near absence of time - dependent effects in marginal or good solvents ( [ Friedman and O’Shaughnessy , 1993 ] ) . Comparison of Model to Experiment and Predictions Dependence of Elongation Rate on Actin and Proﬁlin Concentrations The model of Figure 2A captures the nonlinear depen - dence of the elongation rate of formin - associated ATP - actin on the proﬁlin concentration . By using the experi - mental or estimated parameters of Table 1 , in Figure 3A we present ﬁts to the experiments of Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) . Similarlyto theseexperiments , theoretical curves exhibit a maximum at a proﬁlin concentration of w 5 m M , Figure 2 .

Path 1 ( I / II , direct assembly of proﬁlin - actin onto FH1 ) and path 2 ( II / III , assembly of free actin onto proﬁlin - FH1 ) assembly is catalyzed by FH1 . Paths 3 ( I / VI ) and 4 ( I / VII ) represent direct addition of proﬁlin - actin or actin to the barbed end , respectively . The net elongation rate is the sum of the four paths . Molecular Cell 458 followed by a slow decay . The data of Figure 3A support a picture in which ﬁlaments associated with formins that have a large number of proﬁlin binding sites in FH1 can grow faster than free ﬁlaments . In obtaining this rate en - hancement , none of the association rate constants ex - ceeded established values . The model accounts for the almost linear dependence of the formin - mediated elongation on actin concentration ( Figure 3B ) . Figure 3C shows the elongation rate as a function of proﬁlin and actin concentrations for three different values of the proﬁlin - actin bulk equilibrium dissociation constant K dPA , for Bni1p . The rate is a complex function of proﬁlin and actin concentrations . For a ﬁxed concen - tration of actin , there is an optimal proﬁlin concentration giving maximal growth . For a ﬁxed proﬁlin concentra - tion , the rate increases with the actin concentration with a slope dependent on the concentration of proﬁlin . To be consistent with the observation that formin - medi - ated growth of 1 m M actin occurs at proﬁlin concentra - tions as high as 25 m M ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , K dPA > 2 m M must be chosen ( Figure 3C ) . The best ﬁt to the data is achieved by using K dPA = 6 m M for all formins and their corresponding proﬁlin . With the exception of budding yeast proﬁlin ( K dPA = 2 . 9 m M ; Eads et al . , 1998 ) used in Table 1 .

The number of FH1 proﬁlin binding sites , N PP , is estimated from Figure 1C . The Cdc12p p value is derived empirically from the ﬁt to data in Figure 3A . Our mechanism requires p > 0 . Proﬁlin - actin binding to FH1 could change p , and this may be important for the function of Cdc12p ; our model does not account for such effects . b Perelroizen et al . ( 1994 ) estimated that the association rate constant of bovine spleen proﬁlin with poly - L - proline oligomers is larger than 200 m M 2 1 s 2 1 .

Model of Formin - Associated Actin Elongation 459 the Bni1p experiments ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , this signiﬁ - cantly exceeds typical experimental values . The Discus - sion addresses this discrepancy . We compared our model to the mDia1 elongation rate measurements of Romero and coworkers ( Romero et al . , 2004 ) by using the parameters from Table 1 and found qualitative agreement , with discrepancies that may be due to different experimental conditions to those of Kovar et al . ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) ( see the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . Polymerization Paths and FH1 Occupancy Figures 3D and 3E examine the contributions of the four polymerization paths of Figure 2D to the elongation rate . We use Bni1p as a reference , as it is the most consistent with a higher K dPA value . Without proﬁlin , there is only direct free actin polymerization ( path 4 ) . With proﬁlin , FH1 - mediated proﬁlin - actin association ( path 1 ) domi - nates . The dependence of proﬁlin - FH1 - mediated free actin association ( path 2 ) on proﬁlin is similar to path 1 , but the amplitude is much smaller . ( With different model parameter values , path 2 can become comparable to path 1 [ datanotshown ] ) . Direct proﬁlin - actin association ( path 3 ) makes a small contribution . Analysis of the ﬁlament ﬂuorescence intensity ( F ) of the TIRFM movies of Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) provides ex - perimental support for the existence of proﬁlin - depen - dent and proﬁlin - independent paths . In these experi - ments , 30 % of the actin was labeled by Oregon - Green ( OG ) on Cys - 374 . Similar to actin labeled on Cys - 374 with pyrene , we expect that proﬁlin has a lower afﬁnity for OG - actin than native actin , because Cys - 374 lies Figure 3 .

At proﬁlin concentrations higher than those giving the maximumelongationrate , proﬁlin - dependentpathscon - tribute less and F approaches levels observed in the ab - sence of proﬁlin . The intensity of ﬁlaments associated with formin mDia1 ( FH2 ) , which lacks the FH1 domain , does not exhibit a deep minimum , as expected in the ab - sence of path 1 . Quantitatively , F f j OG = j , where j and j OG are the polymerization rates of unlabeled and labeled actin , respectively ( assuming similar F for ADP - and ADP - Pi - OG - actin ) . Weak binding of OG - actin to proﬁlin suggests that j OG is weakly dependent on proﬁlin con - centration . In the inset of Figure 4 , we verify that the relationship between 1 / F and j is approximately linear . Thus , all observations in Figure 4 are consistent with our model . Note that Figure 4 indicates weak afﬁnity of OG - actin for all proﬁlins , whereas pyrene - actin binds yeast proﬁlin ( used for Bni1p ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , almost as wellasunlabeled actin ( Eadset al . , 1998 ) . OGandpyrene may have different effects on proﬁlin binding actin . The insets of Figures 3D and 3E show the states of proﬁlin binding sites in FH1 . The inset of Figure 3D shows that high concentrations of proﬁlin saturate FH1 . This saturation blocks available sites for proﬁlin - actin addition , reducing the contribution of FH1 - medi - ated proﬁlin - actin addition ( path 1 ) . This blocking effect does not directly inﬂuence path 2 ( FH1 - mediated free actin addition ) . However , path 2 is inﬂuenced by high proﬁlin levels differently : proﬁlin - actin binding in the bulk reduces the levels of free actin , thus reducing the rate of free actin arrival onto proﬁlin - FH1 . Another effect due to FH1 saturation by proﬁlin is an increase in the rate of proﬁlin - mediated depolymerization ( V / IV / III in Figure 2A ) ( Bubb et al . , 2003 ) . For all concentrations in Figures 3D and 3E , the FH1 occupancy by proﬁlin - actin is low , consistent with our neglect of steric interactions between FH1 bound actin subunits . Dependence of Elongation Rate on Parameter Values Taking Bni1p as a reference , we now examine the role of various model parameters ( Figure 5 ) . This is impor - tant for future experiments in which certain values of these parameters will be modiﬁed . The reference pa - rameter values are the same as in Figure 3 and Table 1 , and K dPA = 6 m M . Because the dominant polymeriza - tion path involves proﬁlin - actin association with FH1 ( path 1 ) , many of the trends in Figure 5 are speciﬁc to this path . We note that many parameters are inter - dependent , and inferring precise values from an exper - iment is often difﬁcult ; our conclusions listed below emphasize the trends rather than speciﬁc quantitative statements . Dependence on Number of Proﬁlin Binding Sites in FH1 , Figure 5A The elongation rate increases with the number of sites but eventually saturates . The reason is that the transfer rate corresponding to the n th site in Equation 4 decays faster than 1 / n . Thus , as the number of sites increases , the sum of transfer rates from all sites reaches an upper bound . This saturation may be the reason why ﬁlaments associated with mDia1 with ﬁve sites elongated as fast as mDia1 construct with 11 putative proﬁlin binding sites ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . Dependence on FH2 Gating Factor p , Figure 5B The elongation rate increases with increasing p . FH1 and proﬁlin can catalyze ﬁlament growth even when p is as small as 0 . 01 . This is possible because an FH1 - captured actin subunit can be transferred rapidly to the barbed end , even when the latter is accessible for a small frac - tion of the time . This could be the main mechanism by which proﬁlin gates capping by Cdc12p ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . It is difﬁcult to obtain a bound on the lowest pos - sible value of p because this also depends on all other parameters . In Figure 3 , we generated realistic curves for Cdc12p by using p = 0 . 08 . For somewhat smaller p values and in the absence of proﬁlin , pointed end growth could dominate over the barbed end associated with Cdc12p . Therefore , the latter would appear as if it were fully capped ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . Dependence on Ring Opening Rate r 2 PF , Figure 5C Fast elongation requires fast ring opening . FH1 would otherwise block elongation by being associated with the barbed end for a signiﬁcant fraction of the time . Above a value w 5000 s 2 1 , the elongation rate increases little with increasing r 2 PF , because in this limit , FH1 is al - most always dissociated from the barbed end . Fast ring opening is consistent with studies supporting a fast dis - sociation rate of proﬁlin from the barbed end ( Kang et al . , 1999 ; Kinosian et al . , 2002 ) . Dependence on Ring Closing Rate Parameter r 0 of Equation 4 , Figure 5D We ﬁnd a range of optimal r 0 values , as r 0 slower than optimal reduces the transfer rate , whereas faster ring closing caps the barbed end . Dependence on Proﬁlin - FH1 Association Rate Constant k F + P , Figure 5E The elongation rate increases with increasing k F + P , be - cause this parameter also determines how fast proﬁ - lin - actin can add on to FH1 . The optimal proﬁlin Figure 4 . Filament Fluoresence Intensity , F , as a Function of [ Proﬁ - lin ] Obtained from Previously Published Movies Movies are from Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) . The intensity of formin - associ - ated ﬁlaments is normalized with respect to formin - free ﬁlaments whose intensity did not change with [ proﬁlin ] , within experimental error . Inset : 1 / F versus formin - associated elongation rate from Figure 3A and Figure 6B ; the relationship is approximately linear : straight lines are linear regression ﬁts for mDia1 , Bni1p , and mDia2 . Model of Formin - Associated Actin Elongation 461 concentration shifts with increasing k F + P : the increasing afﬁnity of proﬁlin for FH1 allows lower concentrations of proﬁlin to block elongation . Dependence on Proﬁlin - FH1 Dissociation Rate k F 2 P , Figure 5F Decreasing values of k F 2 P enhance elongation at low proﬁlin concentrations ; at high proﬁlin concentrations , the dependence is smaller and nonmonotonic . The opti - mal proﬁlin concentration shifts , similarly to Figure 5E . Formin - Associated ADP - Actin Elongation We modeled the dependence of elongation by ADP - ac - tin on the proﬁlin concentration ( Figure 6A ) by using the parameters of Table 1 . Parameter values differed from the ATP - actin values : k B + A was reduced by a factor of 3 , consistent with Pollard ( Pollard , 1986 ) , and the ring closing rates and proﬁlin - actin association rate k B + PA were reduced by a factor of 20 . The value of p is one half that for ATP - actin ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , with the exception of Cdc12p whose p value is not directly available . The model predicts curves for ADP - actin similar to ATP - actin , with rates consistent with the limited experi - mental data that is available . As observed ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , elongation rates are lower than ATP - actin , owing to the smaller ADP - actin association rate constants . The preliminary conclusion is that at least for ADP - actin , proﬁlin - actin associates more slowly with the formin - associated barbed end than free actin . A similar trend is reported for proﬁlin - ADP - actin association to formin - free ends ( Kinosian et al . , 2002 ) . Our model ( Figure 6A ) predicts that high concentra - tions of proﬁlin catalyze fast actin disassembly , similar to the stimulation of elongation by proﬁlin at low proﬁlin concentrations . A similar effect could also occur for ATP - actin but , in that case , depolymerization would also involve ADP - P i - actin . Elongation Kinetics of mDia1 ( FH2 ) The data we ﬁnd most difﬁcult to interpret is the depen - dence of the elongation rate of mDia1 ( FH2 ) - associated ﬁlaments on proﬁlin concentration ( Figure 6B ) . Setting the number of FH1 binding sites to zero and using K dPA = 6 m M and Table 1 , the prediction is the dashed line in Figure 6B . A more reasonable ﬁt ( continuous line ) is obtained if we assume ( 1 ) a smaller association rate constant for proﬁlin - actin and ( 2 ) slow dissociation of proﬁlin from the barbed end . These parameter modi - ﬁcations leave all prior results essentially unchanged , provided we further assume that the dissociation rate of proﬁlin - FH1 from the barbed end is much larger than that of proﬁlin alone ( inset of Figure 6B ) . This obser - vation suggests that an additional role of FH1 could be to promote fast dissociation of proﬁlin , though it may also be an artifact originating in unaccounted processes such as ATP hydrolysis or the effects of actin labeling . Figure 5 . Elongation Rate versus [ Proﬁlin ] and Its Dependence on Parameter Values for Bni1p Thevariedparametersvalues areindicatedin each plot . The nonvaried parameters are the same as in Figure 3 and Table 1 . In ( B ) , all p - dependent values of Table 1 were varied ac - cordingly . In ( C ) , the ring opening rate r 2 PF is equal to k B 2 P . Molecular Cell 462 Discussion The basic element of our model is a transfer mechanism of proﬁlin - actin from FH1 to the barbed end ( Figure 1A ) , gated by FH2 as described by the gating factor p ( Figure 1B ) . The capture of one actin at one site on FH1 generates a local actin concentration of w 10 mM if the subunit’s center of gravity is localized within 5 nm near the barbed end . The corresponding transfer rate is w p 10 4 s 2 1 , which can exceed the rate of bulk subunit arrival to the FH1 , even for small p . In the case of Cdc12p , favorable orientational alignment of actin by FH1 may also be necessary to overcome the small gating parameter ( p < 0 . 1 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) of the FH2 domain . In our model , orientational effects are con - tained within the parameter r 0 . The transfer mechanism in combination with multiple proﬁlin binding sites in FH1 can enhance elongation signiﬁcantly , as for mDia1 . In general , there could be crosstalk between FH1 and FH2 , and the gating factor p may depend on FH1 com - position ( Michelot et al . , 2005 ) ; here , we have assumed that p is a constant . Why the Model Requires K dPA z 6 m M An important parameter that has complicated the inter - pretation of even the polymerization of proﬁlin and actin alone ( Yarmola and Bubb , 2004 ) is the afﬁnity of proﬁlin for ATP - actin , K dPA . We ﬁnd that a value of w 6 m M is re - quired to obtain agreement with the experiments of Ko - var et al . ( 2006 ) , for all formins . For budding yeast proﬁl - ing , which was used for the experiments with Bni1p ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , the K dPA of 2 . 9 m M ( Eads et al . , 1998 ) measured under different ionic conditions is close to the expectations of the model . For mammalian proﬁ - lin , used for the experiments with mDia1 and mDia2 , K dPA = 0 . 1 m M was inferred from direct methods ( Eads et al . , 1998 ; Perelroizen et al . , 1994 ) , and 0 . 6 m M was in - ferred from less direct methods ( Gieselmann et al . , 1995 ) , both well below the value we ﬁnd here . For ﬁssion yeast proﬁlin used for the experiments with Cdc12p , in - direct measurements indicate K dPA = 0 . 2 m M ( Lu and Pol - lard , 2001 ) . If we use such small K dPA values in our model , the results are very different from the previous experiments ( Figure S2 ) . To understand the origin of the requirement of a large K dPA value , in Figure 3C we indicate the thermodynamic boundary separating the region of growth ( color ) from that of depolymerization ( gray ) . This boundary is inde - pendent of the details of the polymerization mechanism and is determined only by detailed balance that requires that growth vanishes when the concentration of free bulk actin , c A , is equal to the critical concentration of ‘‘pure’’ ATP - actin , c critA = k B 2 A = k B + A , or , equivalently , when the total proﬁlin concentration is ( Hill , 1988 ; Hill and Kirschner , 1983 ) c tot ; crit P = K PAd (cid:1) c totA = c critA 2 1 (cid:2) : ( 5 ) By using c critA = 0 . 116 m M ( Table 1 ) , then for a given a to - tal bulk actin concentration c totA , the value of c tot ; crit P de - pends only on K dPA , which is thus a crucial parameter in our model . Notice how the gray region of Figure 3C ex - pands with decreasing K dPA . Because Equation 5 is independent of the kinetic mechanism of growth , it should apply even for polymer - ization of actin andproﬁlin without formin , assuming that proﬁlinbindsonlytoactinmonomersandthebarbedend ( Hill and Kirschner , 1983 ) . However , despite a large num - ber of experiments , the validity of detailed balance for the proﬁlin - actin system has not been clearly veriﬁed . Even though the elongation rate has been observed to decrease with increasing proﬁlin concentration , actin polymerizes at high proﬁlin concentrations ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 2002 ; Gutsche - Perelroizen et al . , 1999 ; Kai - ser et al . , 1986 , 1999 ; Kinosian et al . , 2002 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Pring et al . , 1992 ; Tseng and Pollard , 1982 ; Tseng et al . , 1984 ) . Thus , workers who ﬁtted their data with models satisfying detailed balance were forced to use K dPA > 0 . 8 m M and c critA < 0 . 1 m M ( Kang et al . , 1999 ; Pring et al . , 1992 ) . But even if one used K dPA w 1 m M , itishardtoexplainwhyunlabeledactin can polymerize at proﬁlin concentrations as high as 100 m M ( Gutsche - Perelroizen et al . , 1999 ; Kaiser et al . , 1999 ) . Below , we review six possible origins for the require - ment of large K dPA values in free or formin - mediated pro - ﬁlin - actin polymerization . Further experiments are re - quired to distinguish among these possibilities . Figure 6 . Elongation Rate as aFunction of Proﬁlin Concentrationfor ADP - Actin and for mDia1 ( FH2 ) ( A ) Elongation rate of ADP - actin versus [ proﬁlin ] , tentative theoreti - cal ﬁt to experiment ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . [ ADP - actin ] = 5 m M , param - eters from Table 1 . K dPA = 4 . 5 m M , chosen such that elongation rate vanishes between 6 and 12 m M proﬁlin ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . For [ proﬁlin ] > 10 m M , formins are predicted to catalyze ADP - actin disassembly . ( B ) Elongation rate versus [ proﬁlin ] for mDia1 ( FH2 ) lacking the FH1 domain . Dashed line indicates parameters from Table 1 , K dPA = 6 m M . Continuous line is the same as the dashed but k B + PA = 3 m M 2 1 s 2 1 , k B 2 P = 80 s 2 1 . Inset : elongation rate versus [ proﬁlin ] for mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) . Dashed line : same as Figure 3A . Continuous line : same as dashed but k B + PA = 3 m M 2 1 s 2 1 , k B 2 P = 80 s 2 1 , r 2 PF = 3000 s 2 1 . Model of Formin - Associated Actin Elongation 463 ( 1 ) K dPA is indeed large in the experiments of Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) . This is not impossible given the measure - ments of similarly large values for budding yeast proﬁlin ( Eads et al . , 1998 ) . ( 2 ) The critical concentration of ATP - actin is much smaller than c critA = 0 . 116 m M , in which case smaller K dPA values would be required in Equation 5 to match the experiments of Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) . By using a re - ported value for c critA as low as 0 . 03 m M ( Kang et al . , 1999 ) , we ﬁnd K dPA z 1 . 6 m M , closer to experiment . ( 3 ) Formin processivity is coupled to ATP hydrolysis as proposed by Romero et al . ( 2004 ) , who observed that proﬁlin accelerates the rate of ATP hydrolysis by Ca - actin ﬁlaments nucleated by formin mDia1 and that AMP - PNP - Mg - actin did not polymerize in the presence of formin and proﬁlin . We tested the approximate effects of a coupled hydrolysis mechanism by violating detailed balance and were able to obtain a good ﬁt to the elonga - tion rate by using K dPA = 0 . 1 m M ( Figure S2 ) . This ﬁt fa - vors a coupled hydrolysis mechanism , but we note that Kovar et al . ( 2006 ) found that formin - free ﬁlaments elongate at high proﬁlin concentrations , similarly to for - min - associated ﬁlaments . Thus , if formins accelerate ATP hydrolysis , we would also conclude that hydrolysis is accelerated by proﬁlin alone , as previously proposed ( Gutsche - Perelroizen et al . , 1999 ; Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ; Perelroizen et al . , 1996 ) . However , no such accel - eration was observed in direct measurements of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of proﬁlin ( Blanchoin and Pol - lard , 2002 ) . ( 4 ) The discrepancy arises from proﬁlin - mediated weakening of the afﬁnity of ATP binding to actin ( Kino - sian et al . , 2002 ) . Polymerization of nucleotide - free actin in proﬁlin was reported to be consistent with detailed balance ( Kinosian et al . , 2004 ) . However , the nucleotide destabilizing effect must have a weak inﬂuence , be - cause at the mM concentrations of ATP used in most prior experiments , almost all actin has a bound nucleo - tide . ( 5 ) The calculated value of K dPA is inﬂuenced by a high K dPA of proﬁlin for OG - labeled actin . Here , we assumed that the elongation rate due to OG - actin , j OG , is negligi - ble , consistent with the decrease of elongation rate of formin - free ﬁlaments with increasing OG - actin fraction ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . High values of j OG would mod - ify our estimate of K dPA as for pyrene - actin polymeriza - tion in proﬁlin ( Pring et al . , 1992 ) . ( 6 ) Polymerization is modiﬁed by unknown proﬁlin - ac - tin interactions . For example , side binding of proﬁlin to ﬁlaments ( Schutt et al . , 1993 ) could modify Equation 5 in a way that allows growth at high proﬁlin concentra - tions ( Hill and Kirschner , 1983 ) . Future Prospects Here , we assumed that FH2 remains processively at - tached at the growing or shrinking barbed end . This is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics , but exactly how this is accomplished kinetically is a subject for fu - ture work . A major challenge is understanding the origin of the different values of the gating factor among for - mins . This factor depends on FH2 properties such as the fraction of the time that FH2 spends in states that al - low subunit addition . The structure and dynamics of these states remains to be established . An interesting is - sue is how freely FH2 can rotate around the barbed end as suggested by experiments with surface - attached for - mins ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Shemesh et al . , 2005 ) . Another intriguing issue is how other formin domains coordinate with FH1FH2 . The N - terminal regulatory do - mains of mDia1 form stable dimers ( Li and Higgs , 2005 ; Otomo et al . , 2005a ; Rose et al . , 2005 ) , so the FH1 domains are likely to form a closed loop in full - length formin dimers rather than the dangling tails shown in Figure 1 . This dimerization ( or crosslinking to formins of other ﬁlaments ) must not interfere signiﬁ - cantly with FH1 ﬂexibility , if the transfer mechanism de - scribed here is relevant for full - length formins .
