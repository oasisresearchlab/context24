Voth 1 Proteins containing a Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain regulate membrane curvature in the cell . Recent simulations have revealed that BAR proteins assemble into linear aggregates , strongly affecting membrane curvature and its in - plane stress proﬁle .

By using coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations , we show that increased surface tension signiﬁcantly impacts the dynamics of protein assembly . While tensionless membranes promote a rapid formation of long - living linear aggregates of N - BAR proteins , increase in tension alters the geometry of protein association . At high tension , protein interactions are strongly inhibited .

L ipid bilayer membranes are quasi - two - dimensional ﬂuid assemblies that take part in numerous dynamic cellular processes . Their shape is determined by the interplay of molecular interactions at the nanometre - scale lipid – water inter - face and the macroscopic elastic properties , displayed at its thousand - fold larger area 1 , 2 . In cells , a large number of proteins associate with membranes to alter their shape 3 . This process is a key step in facilitating important tasks such as endocytosis , vesicular trafﬁcking , infection , immune response and the formation of organelles 3 , 4 . A family of proteins that contain a Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain are perhaps the best - known membrane remodellers in cells 5 , 6 . These proteins preferentially bind to curved surfaces and , at sufﬁciently high membrane - bound densities , they actively remodel the synthetic liposomes and various cellular compartments 7 – 9 . A large subset of these proteins is termed N - BAR proteins , because they contain an N - terminal amphipathic helix . Electron microscopy imaging demonstrated that N - BAR proteins may polymerize into a cylindrical scaffold that stabilizes the structure of tubules and ﬁxes its radius 10 . It has also been shown that N - BAR proteins can induce ﬁssion of the membrane , leading to complex reticular membrane structures 11 or the disintegration of small liposomes 12 . The curved shape of BAR proteins provides an intuitive understanding of why they interact with membrane curvature . On the other hand , epsin N - terminal homology domains are not intrinsically curved , but they also sense and induce curvature 13 – 15 . Epsin N - terminal homology domains interact with the membrane by inserting their amphipathic helices into the bilayer , a process demonstrated to induce signiﬁcant spontaneous curvature , provided that the insertion is shallow 16 – 19 . It has also been predicted that amphipathic helices sense lipid - packing defects 20 , 21 or in - plane stresses 22 , both of which increase in curved bilayers . Many studies have shown how molecular interactions and the association of proteins affect the morphology and mechanics of membranes at larger scales . Our aim here is to study the opposite perspective in this relationship : how does membrane mechanics affect the dynamics of protein association at the molecular level ? Surface tension is a key mechanical property in regulating the motility and the reshaping of cell membranes . Effective tension in cells is a consequence of ( 1 ) pressure difference across the membrane surface and ( 2 ) the adhesion of the membrane to the cytoskeleton 23 – 25 . As tense membranes resist deformations , it is thus expected that tension will affect membrane remodelling . In fact , it has been shown in cells that under high tension the rate of endocytosis decreases 26 and it can change the molecular sequence of membrane - remodelling events 27 – 29 . Clearly , surface tension has an important inﬂuence on the biochemical pathways of membrane remodelling and the resulting cellular morphology . Interestingly , an experimental paper coinciding with this contribution explored the role of surface tension on the membrane - remodelling power of endophilin . The study demonstrated that the initiation of membrane tubulation is promoted by increased protein density and is inhibited by membrane tension . This result led the authors to conclude that a sudden reduction in membrane tension , for example , due to fusion of exocytic vesicles , could promote the generation of curvature in endocytosis 30 . Moreover , in light of a recently discovered endophilin - mediated endocytic pathway 31 , which relies on actin polymerization for the uptake of , for example , bacterial toxins 32 , it is conceivable that tension could actively modulate the dynamics of membrane - remodelling pathways mediated by BAR proteins . If we assume that curvature instabilities generate an effective interaction among proteins , we can expect that these interactions will depend on tension , simply based on the membrane’s natural length scale , l ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k = s p , where l is the curvature decay length , k membrane bending modulus and s membrane tension 33 – 35 . Indeed , there are numerous analytical studies that have explored how membrane deformations lead to effective interactions among membrane - bound proteins ( reviewed in refs 33 , 36 – 38 ) . The sign , magnitude and length scale of protein – protein interactions depends on their geometry and the way they interact with the membrane . For instance , simultaneous thickening or thinning of the bilayer by two transmembrane inclusions will result in their attraction , whereas if one protein thickens and the other thins the bilayer , they will repel each other 37 . Theory predicts that symmetric inclusions in the membrane will repel each other if they are oriented in the same direction , whereas if they have opposite orientation , they will repel each other at short distances and attract each other at long distances 34 , 35 , 39 , 40 . Furthermore , two particles are predicted to be attractive in case of anisotropic interactions with the membrane 41 , strong membrane afﬁnity 42 , 43 or high contact angle 44 . It is also suspected that there is a Casimir - like attractive force among particles on ﬂuctuating membranes 45 – 48 . Other factors may contribute to protein – protein interactions , such as lipid mixing , lateral protein concentration ﬂuctuations , lipid targeting and so on . Nevertheless , the way tension inﬂuences the collective dynamics of proteins on the membrane has not yet been observed at the molecular level . Moreover , it is not obvious how membrane tension couples with the association of BAR proteins and ultimately how changing membrane tension could quantitatively and qualitatively affect protein - mediated membrane remodelling . In our previous work , we have shown that BAR proteins form linear aggregates and meshes on the membrane 49 , in the same manner—but in a much more robust fashion—as is observed for spherical particles adsorbed on generic ﬂuid membranes 50 . We presume the stronger attractions among proteins are a result of anisotropic local membrane deformations and so we anticipate that membrane tension will play an important role in the large - scale protein assembly . In this work , we use coarse - grained ( CG ) molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations of N - BAR domains as well as spherical particles on planar membranes , at different tensions and protein surface densities . We show that membrane tension has a strong effect on the collective behaviour of proteins , and we provide a visualization of the dynamics of protein assembly as a function of surface tension . Our results imply that surface tension has a more complex effect than just inhibiting large - scale membrane reshaping . Results Membrane tension inhibits protein – protein interactions . Our recent CG MD simulations showed that N - BAR proteins assemble into string - like aggregates on tensionless membranes 49 . This linear aggregation leads to meshing at a sufﬁciently high protein surface coverage ( B 20 % ) . Here , we carried out CG MD simulations of N - BAR proteins bound to ﬂat membrane sheets at protein coverage ranging from 4 to 20 % . Note , the functional N - BAR unit on the membrane is a dimer 51 and we consider it a single protein molecule , in both the computational modelling and the analysis . Therefore , throughout the text , surface density is deﬁned as percent coverage of N - BAR dimers . Analogously , dimerization and polymerization refer to the association of two or more N - BAR dimers . By setting a negative external pressure of the simulation barostat , we impose a constant non - zero membrane tension . We note , however , surface tension calculated from the stress tensor in an MD simulation is conjugate to a microscopic area .

All rights reserved . In tether - pulling experiments , the measured tension is conjugate to the projected membrane 52 . Therefore , the absolute values of surface tension reported here should be taken as approximate and likely systematically higher than the ones obtained in tether - pulling experiments 52 , 53 . We explored how the change of membrane tension affects the organization of proteins on the surface . We found that when the tension is increased , the dynamics of self - assembly markedly changes . In simulations of tensionless sheets at B 5 % protein coverage , proteins rapidly assemble into linear aggregates , keeping their conﬁguration for the remainder of the trajectory . Increasing the tension to 0 . 8 mN m (cid:2) 1 still favours the assembly along a line , although the conﬁguration of the oligomer is no longer constant and is marked by frequent exchange of dimerization partners . By doubling the tension to 1 . 6 mN m (cid:2) 1 , association becomes transient and we no longer observe linear aggregation . In addition to inhibiting the formation of strings , increased tension reduces the dimerization lifetime . On tensionless membranes , proteins are part of dimers 94 % of the trajectory . This lifetime is reduced to 67 % at 0 . 8 mN m (cid:2) 1 and further down to 10 % at 1 . 6 mN m (cid:2) 1 . The kymogram in Fig . 1 depicts how the change in tension alters both the dimerization kinetics and the persistence time of dimers . See also Supplementary Movie 1 showing simulations of N - BAR proteins at zero , intermediate and high membrane tension . To quantify the afﬁnity of proteins to one another , we performed biased MD simulations followed by umbrella - sampling calculations . First , we calculated the energy of an N - BAR molecule joining a preformed aggregate , containing at least three proteins , as a function of the end - to - end distance between the terminal and the joining monomers . We term this free energy the polymerization energy ( F p ) . We found that with increased tension , the magnitude of F p monotonously diminishes from 12 k B T at zero tension to 3 k B T at 1 . 8 mN m (cid:2) 1 . If approximating linear dependence of polymerization on membrane tension , the value of F p is comparable to the thermal ﬂuctuation energy at 4 2 mN m (cid:2) 1 ( Fig . 2a ) . Considering the absence of imposed signiﬁcant attractions between N - BAR molecules , the resulting strong effective attraction implies that protein – protein interactions are mediated by local membrane deformations and are , as such , strongly sensitive to membrane tension . Next , we calculated F p as a function of the chain length . The magnitude of F p in the course of dimerization has a 6 - k B T minimum . If the protein joins a preformed linear aggregate composed of three or ﬁve proteins , the magnitude of the energy is increased to , respectively , 12 k B T and 11 k B T ( Fig . 2a ) . This calculation further points to the importance of local membrane curvature in the aggregation of proteins , as local deformations are dependent on the local protein density 54 . Interestingly , the linear aggregation has a strikingly long interaction range , B 125 Å for the case of a tetramer ( Fig . 2a , top panel ) , which is 10 – 20 times the Debye length at physiological ionic strength . This range is comparable to the hypothesized 100 - Å average distance between neighbouring proteins on the membrane 33 . Increased membrane tension signiﬁcantly reduces the interaction range ( to B 50 Å at 1 . 8 mN m (cid:2) 1 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Moreover , this range increases with increased chain length , contrary to the magnitude of interaction energy , which seems to converge at N 4 2 ( Fig . 2b ) . As mentioned in the Introduction , the interaction length scale is expected to decrease proportional to the inverse square root of membrane tension , although accurately predicting this length scale from analytical arguments is difﬁcult for a multi - protein linear chain . We compared the maximum interaction length obtained from umbrella sampling to the one calculated based on the natural length scale of the membrane . It appears that there is excellent agreement in the case of only two proteins at all tensions and also in the case of a protein and a linear chain only at high tension , that is , 4 1 mN m (cid:2) 1 ( Fig . 2b right , compare dots with cross marks ) . Evidently , the scaling must diverge at zero tension . However , at low tension , the deviation is likely due to the high anisotropy of the protein , high local D M D M D M 0 0 0 = 0 (cid:2) ( mN m – 1 ) = 0 . 8 = 1 . 6 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 15 10 5 Million time steps Figure 1 | Dynamics of dimerization of N - BARs at 4 % surface coverage .

Tension and protein coverage determine association geometry . Increased membrane tension not only weakens protein – protein interactions , but it appears to affect the geometry of their assembly . The N - BAR domain has a characteristic elongated shape , giving rise to two possible in - plane directions of poly - merization : end to end ( 180 (cid:2) between dimers ) and side by side ( 0 (cid:2) between dimers ) . On tensionless membrane sheets , N - BAR proteins mostly form end - to - end dimers , thus ensuring the longest possible aggregate . To specify , at zero tension , 87 % of dimers will align at an angle higher than 160 (cid:2) while only 0 . 1 % will align at an angle lower than 70 (cid:2) . Increasing tension increases the range of the dimerization angles and increasingly favours side - by - side contacts ( Fig . 3a ) . To quantify the free energy associated with the dimerization angle , we split the range of angles into 5 – 10 (cid:2) windows , calculated the percent population ( in time ) of each dimer in the simulation at a given angle window and ﬁnally , we computed the free energy by inverting the Boltzmann distribution . We term this value the orientation free energy ( F o ) . At low tensions ( 0 . 2 mN m (cid:2) 1 and below ) , there is a sharp minimum for the formation of end - to - end dimers , with a barrier at B 7 . 5 k B T ( Fig . 3b ) . Above 0 . 2 mN m (cid:2) 1 , the range of dimerization angles shifts towards smaller values , accompanied by the decrease in the barrier between the two terminal geometries . Finally , at tensions higher than 1 . 5 mN m (cid:2) 1 , there is a nearly equal probability of populating both dimerization states ( Fig . 3b ) . It appears that there is a relatively sharp transition between 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mN m (cid:2) 1 that allows for the sampling of a wider range of angles of contact , thus allowing for branching of N - BAR aggregates . An increase to 1 . 6 mN m (cid:2) 1 lowers the barrier to B 4 k B T . Consequently , with increasing membrane tension , there are relatively more side - by - side dimers , although we remind the reader that the overall probability of dimerization is diminished . This change in dimerization geometry indicates that at increased membrane tension , any residual interactions among proteins will tend to maximize their contact surface . To study the effect of shape of interacting particles on their self - assembly , we tested how spherical particles of size and binding strength comparable to BAR proteins interact with one another at different membrane tensions at B 10 % surface coverage . It has previously been demonstrated that adhesive spherical particles assemble into linear aggregates on a generic ﬂuid membrane model 50 . Provided that particle – membrane afﬁnity is sufﬁciently high , particles will induce long membrane protrusions 43 . Our CG model reproduces those observations at vanishing tension ( Fig . 3c ) . An increase in tension to 1 mN m (cid:2) 1 completely inhibits particle – particle interactions . By analysing the dynamics of particle association throughout the trajectory at intermediate tensions , we observed that dimers and trimers frequently form , albeit with a short lifetime . Interestingly , a tetramer is the minimum chain that promotes the formation of persistent linear aggregates ( Fig . 4 ) . We found that a slight increase in membrane tension , to 0 . 05 mN m (cid:2) 1 , appreciably increases the time required for linear aggregation , while at and above 0 . 25 mN m (cid:2) 1 , the formation of linear aggregates is completely suppressed ( see last kymogram in Fig . 4 ) . Moreover , it is conceivable that pairs of dimers would form in a side - by - side orientation , analogously to N - BAR domains . However , we never observed such association , most likely because pairs of spheres have a too short lifetime to encounter another pair of spheres at the right conﬁguration . These results demonstrate an interesting tension - dependent linear aggregation dynamics of spherical particles but , impor - tantly , they also show that the elongated shape of N - BAR proteins facilitates a wider range of tension - dependent association geometries . An effect on the dimerization geometry similar to increasing tension may be achieved by increasing protein density on the membrane . At 10 % surface coverage , we observed branching from the linear aggregate ( Fig . 5a ) , while at 20 % , branched strings interconnected to form a meshwork on the surface ( Fig . 5b ) . 0 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 60 (cid:4) ( ° ) 120 180 5 0 F o ( k B T ) 0 . 9 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 0 . 8 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 Figure 3 | Membrane tension alters N - BAR orientation .

By calculating the orientation free energy , we found that the barrier between the two dimerization geometries does not in fact decrease in magnitude when increasing the density from 2 to 10 % , but it signiﬁcantly shifts towards smaller angles , thus permitting the sampling of a wider range of angles ( Fig . 5c ) . Increasing tension to 0 . 8 mN m (cid:2) 1 breaks the meshed structures , although much of the proteins tend to form lines . Finally , high tension ( 4 1 . 5 mN m (cid:2) 1 ) signiﬁcantly reduces the protein association , and any residual interactions do not appear to have a preferred angle ( Fig . 5 ) . Modulating dimerization geometry of BAR domains . To explore how the mechanical parameters of the membrane and the geometric shape of proteins determine their dimerization geometry , we devise very simple scaling arguments . We consider the BAR domain as a spherocylinder bound to an elastic membrane . This model is the simplest approximation of the BAR domain shape and so the arguments derived in this section should be viewed as only qualitative . Nevertheless , despite the many limitations of this model , it seems to provide an intuitive understanding of why some conditions favour side - by - side over end - to - end association ( see below ) . For a more careful treatment , we refer the reader to quantitative analytical models of cylindrical , anisotropic and point - like membrane inclusions , such as in refs 34 , 35 , 41 , 48 , 55 – 60 . The total free energy of the membrane ( F ) can be written as F ¼ F b þ F w þ F s , where F b is the membrane bending component , F w comes from protein – membrane interactions , that is , particle wrapping and F s is a consequence of membrane tension , that is , changes in membrane area upon deformation . Local deformation induced by a single protein can be written in terms of the Helfrich bending energy as F b ¼ 1 2 k A 2 H (cid:2) H 0 ð Þ 2 ; ð 1 Þ where k is the bending rigidity , A the area of the deformation , H the mean membrane curvature and H 0 the spontaneous membrane curvature 54 , 61 . H 0 should not appreciably change between two dimerization geometries and we do not take it into account . The bending energy imposed by one spherocylinder of length L and radius R can be estimated as 2 ka p L 2 R þ 4 p (cid:3) (cid:4) , where a is the area fraction of the molecule wrapped by the membrane . We consider that in dimerization , two proteins associate closely enough not to deform the membrane at their interface , based on local curvature calculations carried out previously 49 . Each following term represents the energy per single protein molecule . Bending energies in the end - to - end ( F b , e ) and side - by - side ( F b , s ) dimerization topologies take the forms : F b ; e ¼ ka p L R þ 5 p (cid:5) (cid:6) ; ð 2 Þ F b ; s ¼ ka p L 2 R þ 5 p (cid:5) (cid:6) : ð 3 Þ The free - energy gain from particle wrapping can be estimated as adhesion energy F w ¼ (cid:2) Aw ¼ (cid:2) a w 2 p RL þ 4 p R 2 ð Þ , where w is the membrane – protein interaction strength per unit area . High values of w present a limitation to the model as they would appreciable increase a , and so we only consider a narrow range of binding afﬁnities that we demonstrated to lead to linear aggregation of N - BARs 49 . Wrapping energies in the end - to - end ( F w , e ) and side - by - side ( F w , s ) dimerization topologies become : F w ; e ¼ (cid:2) a w 2 p RL þ 4 p R 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) ; ð 4 Þ F w ; s ¼ (cid:2) a w p RL þ 4 p R 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) : ð 5 Þ In the case of non - zero surface tension , we add the term associated with the resistance in the change in area , which scales as s A . Aggregation of proteins favourably contributes to this energy , as it locally deforms a smaller membrane area per molecule . For the end - to - end and side - by - side geometries , the difference in deformed area compared with a monomer is 4 ap R 2 and ap RL , respectively . These are only approximate values and will highly depend on the way proteins corrugate the membrane underneath . Finally , the net free energy of dimerization in the end - to - end compared with side - by - side conﬁguration is given by F e (cid:2) F s ¼ p L a 2 R k (cid:2) p RL a w (cid:2) p R 4 R (cid:2) L ð Þ as : ð 6 Þ where F e and F s are total energies of the end - to - end and side - by - side states , respectively . Note , the entropic cost of dimerization cancels out between the two geometries . At zero tension , the choice of dimerization topology will be determined by the experimentally tunable parameters , w and k . In cells , the afﬁnity of proteins on the membrane is set by the charge density on the BAR domain , the presence of amphipathic helices , the ionic strength of the solvent , membrane composition , lipid sorting and other factors . Bending rigidity is determined by lipid composition . On the basis of our calculations in the previous paragraph , high adhesion strength favours the end - to - end association ( that is , F e (cid:2) F s o 0 ) , in which the exposed area to the membrane is greater ( Fig . 6a ) . Conversely , bilayers with a higher rigidity will direct the proteins in the side - by - side conﬁguration ( Fig . 6a ) . 0 0 . 8 1 . 6 2 . 0 0 . 8 0 0 60 120 180 1 . 8 2 1 . 6 0 . 9 0 2 % 10 % 0 5 (cid:4) ( ° ) 0 60 120 180 (cid:4) ( ° ) F o ( k B T ) 0 5 F o ( k B T ) Figure 5 | The inﬂuence of protein density on self - assembly .

All rights reserved . Another key parameter that couples with tension in directing the association geometry is the shape of the protein , described by the aspect ratio L / R . For L / R 4 4 , higher tension increasingly favours side - by - side geometry ( Fig . 6a ) . Conversely , for L / R o 4 , increased tension favours the end - to - end geometry , and L / R ¼ B 4 is insensitive to membrane tension ( Fig . 6a ) . Interest - ingly , calculations predict end - to - end geometry at vanishing tension for all L / R r 3 . Finally , we calculate the conﬁgurational diagram that predicts the association geometry from the interaction energy , protein aspect ratio and membrane tension ( Fig . 6b ) . The shape of the conﬁgurational diagram changes with increased tension , favour - ing side - by - side interactions at higher tension , as this conﬁgura - tion is expected to induce less membrane deformation . The N - BAR domain of endophilin A1 , used in this study , has L / R ¼ 6 , with R ¼ 2 . 0 nm . If we use these parameters in predicting association geometry from phase diagrams in Fig . 6 , it appears that our CG MD observations agree very well with the simple scaling arguments presented herein . Discussion Our simulations indicate a signiﬁcant and geometrically con - sistent association of N - BAR proteins on the membrane that , in a narrow and biologically realizable space of protein – membrane interaction strengths , leads to linear aggregation 49 . Considering the observed similarity in aggregation between the protein model and simple particles 50 , the linear aggregation phenomenon may apply to a number of proteins that induce curvature instabilities , leading to effective attractions on the membrane . Proteins are more complicated than spherical particles , however , due to their shape and diverse modes of interacting with the membrane . The N - BAR domain is bent and elongated , thus it has multiple ways of forming linear aggregates on the surface . On the basis of previous calculations 49 , 60 , 62 , the attractions among N - BAR are most likely driven by the strong anisotropic interactions with the membrane 41 . We show that , at low membrane tension , N - BAR proteins form aggregates of maximum possible length , thus ensuring rapid and efﬁcient recruitment to membrane - remodelling sites . When considering a broader range of protein and membrane properties , we predict that side - by - side pairing can be favoured even at low tension , but only on more rigid membranes ( for example , those containing cholesterol ) ; as such conﬁguration would bend the membrane less . Conversely , end - to - end pairing is favoured at increased protein – membrane interactions ( for example , in case of higher membrane charge or lower ionic strength of the solution ) and for more extended proteins ( such as F - BAR and I - BAR proteins ) , which is a consequence of favourable protein – membrane interactions . Increase in protein density above 10 % , as we have shown , permits the branching of the proteins , helping form meshes , that can be broken apart with increased tension . Aside from simple steric arguments , meshing could be a consequence of the inherent repulsion between the lines of protein polymers . Such interactions would likely ﬁx the size of meshes , thereby resulting in a homogenous distribution and radius of tubules , as observed in vitro 9 . At mesoscopic scales , the thermal ﬂuctuations of lipid membranes could act to instantaneously concentrate the proteins at certain domains , while depleting them at others . Areas enriched with N - BAR proteins would serve as nucleation sites for linear aggregation . On the basis of our measurements , an oligomer comprising only three proteins is stable at longer periods of time and generates a strong potential for polymeriza - tion . Increasing membrane tension reduces the frequency of membrane ﬂuctuations , and in this way directly inhibits the initiation of protein polymerization . In cells , membrane tension ranges up to 0 . 45 mN m (cid:2) 1 , as measured by a tether - pulling essay in motile keratocytes 25 . This value is already within the range where we see a difference in protein – protein association ; in particular , on the association geometry , strength and interaction length scale . Various studies have demonstrated that transient , and in some cases local , increases in membrane tension can signiﬁcantly impact the sequence of events in membrane remodelling 27 – 29 . There are several possible sources that could give rise to local membrane tension . One is actin polymerization that increases tension due to adhesive interactions with the membrane . This mechanism is especially important for membrane remodelling that involves endophilin , the N - BAR protein of our study , in light of recent studies demonstrating the interplay of endophilin and actin in a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway 31 , 32 .

Conversely , sudden decrease in membrane tension ( for example , fusion of exocytic vesicles ) , would trigger the onset of membrane tubulation , based on recent experiments on endophilin 30 . The same process would promote the formation of linear aggregates from longer distances , again promoting membrane remodelling . In addition , physical limitations ( crowding , diffusion barriers ) would also impact the in - plane dynamics of lipids . For example , it has recently been demonstrated that several BAR proteins cause lipid diffusion barriers , thereby forming lipid microdomains 63 . Such a barrier would decouple the lipids underneath the proteins from the bulk , effectively giving rise to local membrane tension , which can signiﬁcantly differ from the low global tension . Therefore , it appears very likely that membrane tension is a crucial modulator of protein self - assembly in cells . Finally , it would be interesting to investigate how surface tension affects different modes of interaction with the membrane ( that is , insertion versus adhesion ) . In this study , we use highly coarsened models that provide insights into the long - wavelength phenomena . To elucidate the submolecular details of interaction with the membrane and its effect on protein self - assembly , higher - resolution CG models than the one presented here are required and will be part of our future research efforts . Methods The model . We used CG lipid and protein models and their interaction parameters as described previously 11 , 49 . In brief , three - site lipids were modelled using the hybrid analytical coarse - graining methodology 64 , while the 26 - site N - BAR domain was modelled using the elastic - network approach 65 . The protein – membrane attractions were modelled using a Lennard - Jones function set between the protein sites representing the amphipathic helices ( six in total ) and the lipid head groups , with a 1 . 8 - kcalmol (cid:2) 1 well depth , with the minimum set at 1 . 5nm . In simulations with nanoparticles , the particles were modelled as incompressible spheres with a 2 - nm radius , using Lennard - Jones interactions with lipid head groups , with a 1 . 0 - kcalmol (cid:2) 1 well depth , set at 1 . 5nm . Unbiased simulations . We constructed the systems by randomly arranging N - BAR proteins ( or particles ) on the surface of a ﬂat membrane patch , 70nm in x and y dimensions . We varied the surface density of N - BAR domains from 2 to 20 % , while we simulated the nanoparticles at 10 % coverage . We carried out the simulations under constant Np xy T conditions ( the box was allowed to change in size only in x and y directions , with the x and y pressure components coupled ) , using Nose´ – Hoover equations of motion , with a coupling constant of 600 t ( t B 50fs ) . We varied the barostat pressure ( p x ¼ p y ) between simulations from zero to (cid:2) 4 . 0atm , to simulate non - zero membrane tension . We calculated surface tension according to : s ¼ l z (cid:3) p zz (cid:2) 1 2 p xx þ p yy (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7) (cid:8) ; ð 7 Þ where p xx and p yy are tangential components of the pressure tensor , p zz is the normal component and l z is the thickness of the bilayer . Note , normally l z denotes the z - dimension of a simulation box , but due to the absence of an explicit solvent , solely the bilayer molecules contribute to pressure . The temperature of the ther - mostat was set to 300K , with a coupling constant of 6 t . Systems were initially equilibrated for 1 . 2 million time steps , then production runs were carried out for 10 – 30 million time steps ( at up to 0 . 4 t , that is , B 20fs per step ) . All simulations were run using the MD suite LAMMPS 66 . Free - energy simulations . To calculate the polymerization free energy , we used the umbrella - sampling approach . We simulated a very large bilayer patch ( 200nm in x and y dimensions ) to eliminate the risk of monomers interacting with protein chains in the mirror image . As collective variable , we chose the end - to - end distance between the incoming N - BAR molecule and the terminal N - BAR in the nascent chain . Simulation windows were spaced 1 – 2Å and we applied a quadratic potential with a force constant of 1 – 2kcalÅ (cid:2) 2 mol (cid:2) 1 . Each window was run for 100 , 000 simulation time steps . We placed additional quadratic constraints to keep the aggregate linear , by keeping the distance between neighbouring N - BARs at 25Å and an angle of 180 (cid:2) , using a force constant of 0 . 05kcalÅ (cid:2) 2 mol (cid:2) 1 . Note , in free - energy calculations the effect of these additional constraints cancel out . We repeated each run twice from independent starting trajectories . Finally , we computed the free energy using the weighted histogram analysis method . References 1 . Lipowsky , R . The conformation of membranes . Nature 349 , 475 – 481 ( 1991 ) . 2 .
