Here , we investigate how inhibition of the widely expressed transcriptional coactivator BRD4 leads to selective inhibition of the MYC oncogene in multiple myeloma ( MM ) . BRD4 and Mediator were found to co - occupy thousands of enhancers associated with active genes . They also co - occupied a small set of exceptionally large super - enhancers associated with genes that feature prominently in MM biology , including the MYC onco - gene . Treatment of MM tumor cells with the BET - bro - modomain inhibitor JQ1 led to preferential loss of BRD4 at super - enhancers and consequent tran - scription elongation defects that preferentially im - pacted genes with super - enhancers , including MYC . Super - enhancers were found at key oncogenic drivers in many other tumor cells . These observa - tions have implications for the discovery of cancer therapeutics directed at components of super - en - hancers in diverse tumor types . INTRODUCTION Chromatin regulators are attractive as therapeutic targets for cancer because they are deregulated in numerous cancers ( Bay - lin and Jones , 2011 ; Elsa¨sser et al . , 2011 ; Esteller , 2008 ; Fein - berg and Tycko , 2004 ; You and Jones , 2012 ) and are amenable to small - molecule inhibition ( Cole , 2008 ; Dawson and Kouzar - ides , 2012 ; Geutjes et al . , 2012 ) . Inhibition of some chromatin regulators has already proven to be efﬁcacious for treatment of certain cancers ( Issa and Kantarjian , 2009 ; Marks and Xu , 2009 ) . Most chromatin regulators , however , are expressed in a broad range of healthy cells and contribute generally to gene expression , so inhibition of these important genome - associated proteins might be expected to adversely affect global gene expression in healthy cells and thus produce highly toxic effects . Nonetheless , inhibitors of some chromatin regulators , such as BRD4 , have been shown to selectively inhibit transcription of key oncogenic drivers such as c - MYC ( hereafter referred to as MYC ) in multiple tumor types ( Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Delmore et al . , 2011 ; Mertz et al . , 2011 ; Zuber et al . , 2011 ) . It is important to understand how inhibition of a widely expressed , general regulator such as BRD4 can exert a selective effect on the expression of a small number of genes in speciﬁc cells . BRD4 is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal ( BET ) subfamily of human bromodomain proteins , which includes BRDT , BRD2 , BRD3 , and BRD4 . These proteins asso - ciate with acetylated chromatin and facilitate transcriptional activation ( LeRoy et al . , 2008 ; Rahman et al . , 2011 ) . BRD4 was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an interaction partner of the murine Medi - ator coactivator complex ( Jiang et al . , 1998 ) and was subse - quently shown to associate with Mediator in a variety of human cells ( Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Wu and Chiang , 2007 ) . BRD4 is involved in the control of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II ( RNA Pol II ) through its recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor P - TEFb ( Jang et al . , 2005 ; Yang et al . , 2005 ) . Almost all human cells express the BRD4 gene , based on analysis of human tissue expression data across 90 distinct tissue types ( human body index - transcriptional proﬁling , see Extended Experimental Procedures ) , and BRD4 is found to be associated with a large population of active genes in CD4 + T cells ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . It is not yet clear whether the BRD4 protein is generally involved in the transcription of active genes in tumor cells or if it is selectively associated with a sub - set of these genes . 320 Cell 153 , 320 – 334 , April 11 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . Two recently developed bromodomain inhibitors , JQ1 and iBET , selectively bind to the amino - terminal twin bromodomains of BRD4 ( Filippakopoulos et al . , 2010 ; Nicodeme et al . , 2010 ) . These BET inhibitors cause selective repression of the potent MYC oncogene in a range of tumors , including multiple myeloma ( MM ) , Burkitt’s lymphoma ( BL ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) ( Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Delmore et al . , 2011 ; Mertz et al . , 2011 ; Ott et al . , 2012 ; Zuber et al . , 2011 ) . The inhibition of MYC apparently occurs as a conse - quence of BRD4 depletion at the enhancers that drive MYC expression ( Delmore et al . , 2011 ) . Although BRD4 is widely expressed in mouse tissues , mice are reasonably tolerant of the levels of BET bromodomain inhibition that inhibit certain tumors in mouse models ( Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Delmore et al . , 2011 ; Fili - ppakopoulos et al . , 2010 ; Mertz et al . , 2011 ; Zuber et al . , 2011 ) . The MM cell line ( MM1 . S ) used to study the effects of JQ1 has an IgH - MYC rearrangement , and MYC gene expression is driven by factors associated with the IgH enhancer ( Dib et al . , 2008 ; Shou et al . , 2000 ) . Enhancers function through cooperative and synergistic interactions between multiple transcription factors and coactivators ( Carey et al . , 1990 ; Giese et al . , 1995 ; Kim and Maniatis , 1997 ; Thanos and Maniatis , 1995 ) . Cooperative binding and synergistic activation confer increased sensitivity so that small changes in activator concentration can lead to dra - matic changes in activator binding and transcription of associ - ated genes ( Carey , 1998 ) . Furthermore , enhancers with large numbers of transcription factor binding sites can be more sensi - tive to small changes in factor concentration than those with smaller numbers of binding sites ( Giniger and Ptashne , 1988 ; Griggs and Johnston , 1991 ) . This concept led us to postulate that some features of the IgH enhancer might account for the selective effect of BRD4 inhibition . We show here that BRD4 and Mediator are associated with most active enhancers and promoters in MM1 . S tumor cells , but exceptionally high levels of these cofactors occur at a small set of large enhancer regions , which we call super - enhancers . Super - enhancers are associated with MYC and other key genes that feature prominently in the biology of MM , including many lineage - speciﬁc survival genes . Treatment of MM tumor cells with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 caused a preferential loss of BRD4 , Mediator , and P - TEFb at super - enhancers and caused preferen - tial loss of transcription at super - enhancer - associated genes , including the MYC oncogene . Tumor cell addiction to high - level expression of these oncogenes may then contribute to their vulnerability to super - enhancer disruption ( Chin et al . , 1999 ; Felsher and Bishop , 1999 ; Jain et al . , 2002 ; Weinstein , 2002 ) . We ﬁnd super - enhancers in additional tumor types , where they aresimilarlyassociatedwithkeyoncogenes . Thus , keyoncogene drivers of tumor cells are regulated by super - enhancers , which can confer disproportionate sensitivity to loss of the BRD4 coac - tivator and thus cause selective inhibition of transcription . RESULTS BRD4 and Mediator Co - occupy Promoters of Active Genes in Multiple Myeloma Transcription factors bind to enhancers and recruit the Mediator coactivator , which in turn becomes associated with RNA Pol II at the transcription start site ( TSS ) , thus forming DNA loops between enhancers and core promoters ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ) . BRD4 is known to associate with Mediator in some mammalian cells ( Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Jiang et al . , 1998 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ) . To identify active promoter and enhancer elements and to deter - mine how BRD4 and Mediator occupy the genome in MM1 . S MM cells , we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high - throughput sequencing ( chromatin immunoprecipitation [ ChIP ] - seq ) with antibodies against the Mediator subunit MED1 , BRD4 , the enhancer - associated histone modiﬁcation H3K27Ac , and the TSS - associated histone modiﬁcation H3K4Me3 ( Figure 1 ) . ChIP - seq signals for both Mediator and the histone modiﬁcation H3K27Ac have previously been shown to occur at both enhancers and TSSs ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ; Heintzman et al . , 2009 ; Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ) , and enhancers can be distinguished from TSSs by the absence of TSS annotation and relatively low levels of H3K4Me3 . We found that BRD4 co - occupied enhancers and TSSs with MED1 throughout the genome ( Figures 1A and 1B ) and that the levels of BRD4 and MED1 were strongly correlated ( Figure S1 available online ) . To conﬁrm that BRD4 and Mediator are generally associated with active genes in MM1 . S cells , we compared the ChIP - seq data for these regulators with that for RNA Pol II and the histone modiﬁcation H3K4Me3 . The levels of BRD4 and Mediator corre - lated with the levels of RNA Pol II genome wide ( Figure 1C ) . Sig - nals for BRD4 and Mediator were found together with those for the histone modiﬁcation H3K4Me3 and RNA Pol II at (cid:1) 10 , 000 annotated TSSs , and these were considered active TSSs ( Table S1 ) . Signals for BRD4 and the enhancer - associated histone modiﬁcation H3K27Ac were found in (cid:1) 8 , 000 Mediator - occupied regions either lacking TSSs or extending beyond the immediate vicinity of the TSS , and these were considered enhancer regions ( Table S2 , Data S1 , and Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Super - Enhancers Are Associated with Key Multiple Myeloma Genes Further analysis of the (cid:1) 8 , 000 enhancer regions revealed that the MED1 signal at 308 enhancers was signiﬁcantly greater than at all other enhancers and promoters ( Figures 2A and S2A and Table S2 ) . These 308 super - enhancers differed from typical enhancers in both size and Mediator levels ( Figure 2B ) . Remark - ably , (cid:1) 40 % of all enhancer - bound Mediator and BRD4 occupied these 308 super - enhancers . Whereas the typical enhancer had a median size of 1 . 3 kb , the super - enhancers had a median size of 19 . 4 kb . These super - enhancers were thus 15 - fold larger than typical enhancers and were occupied , based on ChIP - seq signal , by 18 - fold more Mediator and 16 - fold more BRD4 . Simi - larly high levels of H3K27Ac were observed in these large regions ( Figure 2B ) . Examples of gene tracks showing super - enhancers at either end of the spectrum of Mediator occupancy ( Figure 2A ) are shown in Figure 2 C . The largest super - enhancer was found associated with the IGLL5 gene , which encodes an immuno - globulin lambda peptide expressed at high levels in these cells . We next sought to identify the complete set of MM1 . S genes that are most likely associated with super - enhancers . Enhancers tend to loop to and associate with adjacent genes in order to activate their transcription ( Go¨ndo¨r and Ohlsson , 2009 ; Lelli Cell 153 , 320 – 334 , April 11 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 321 et al . , 2012 ; Ong and Corces , 2011 ; Spitz and Furlong , 2012 ) . Most of these interactions occur within a distance of (cid:1) 50 kb of the enhancer ( Chepelev et al . , 2012 ) . Using a simple proximity rule , we assigned all transcriptionally active genes ( TSSs ) to super - enhancers within a 50 kb window , a method shown to identify a large proportion of true enhancer / promoter interac - tions in embryonic stem cells ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) . This identiﬁed 681 genes associated with super - enhancers ( Table S3 ) , and 307 of these had a super - enhancer overlapping a portion of the gene , as shown for CCND2 in Figure 2C . Super - enhancer - associated genes were generally expressed at higher levels than genes with typical enhancers and tended to be speciﬁcally expressed in MM1 . S cells ( Figure 2D ) . To test whether components of super - enhancers confer stronger activ - ity compared to typical enhancers , we cloned representative super - enhancer or typical enhancer fragments of similar size into luciferase reporter constructs and transfected these into MM1 . S cells . Cloned sequence fragments from super - en - hancers generated 2 - to 3 - fold higher luciferase activity compared to typical enhancers of similar size ( Figure 2E and Extended Experimental Procedures ) . These results are consis - tent with the notion that super - enhancers help to activate high levels of transcription of key genes that regulate and enforce the MM1 . S cancer cell state . The super - enhancer - associated genes included most genes that have previously been shown to have important roles in MM biology , including MYC , IRF4 , PRDM1 / BLIMP - 1 , and XBP1 ( Figure 3A ) . MYC is a key oncogenic driver in MM ( Chng et al . , 2011 ; Dib et al . , 2008 ; Holien et al . , 2012 ; Shou et al . , 2000 ) , and the MM1 . S MYC locus contains a chromosomal rear - rangement that places MYC under the control of the IgH enhancer , which qualiﬁes as a super - enhancer in MM1 . S cells . The IRF4 gene encodes a key plasma cell transcription factor that is frequently deregulated in MM ( Shaffer et al . , 2008 ) . PRDM1 / BLIMP - 1 encodes a transcription factor that is consid - ered a master regulator of plasma cell development and is required for the formation of plasma cell tumors in a mouse model ( Shapiro - Shelef et al . , 2003 ; Turner et al . , 1994 ) . XBP1 encodes a basic - region leucine zipper ( bZIP ) transcription factor of the CREB - ATF family that governs plasma cell differentiation ( Reimold et al . , 2001 ) . XBP1 is frequently overexpressed in human MM and can drive the development of MM in a mouse model ( Carrasco et al . , 2007 ; Claudio et al . , 2002 ) . Super - enhancers were associated with many additional genes that have important roles in cancer pathogenesis more generally ( Figure 3B ) . Cyclin D2 ( CCND2 ) is deregulated in many human cancers , including MM ( Bergsagel et al . , 2005 ; Musgrove et al . , 2011 ) . The PIM1 kinase has been implicated in the biology of many different cancers ( Shah et al . , 2008 ) . MCL1 and BCL - xL , members of the BCL - 2 family of apoptosis regulators , are frequently deregulated in cancer , promoting cell survival and A B C Figure 1 .

We conclude that su - per - enhancers are frequently associated with genes that feature prominently in the biology of MM and other human cancers . Inhibition of BRD4 Leads to Displacement of BRD4 Genome Wide BRD4 interacts with chromatin - associated proteins such as transcription factors , the Mediator complex , and acetylated his - tones ( Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Dey et al . , 2003 ; Jang et al . , 2005 ; Jiang et al . , 1998 ; Wu and Chiang , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Pre - vious studies have shown that treatment of MM1 . S cells with JQ1 leads to reduced levels of BRD4 at the IgH enhancer that drives MYC expression ( Delmore et al . , 2011 ) , but it is not clear whether such treatment causes a general reduction in the levels of BRD4 associated with the genome . We found that treatment of MM1 . S cells with 500 nM JQ1 for 6 hr reduced the levels of BRD4 genome wide by (cid:1) 70 % ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . This reduction in BRD4 occupancy was evident both by inspec - tion of individual gene tracks ( Figure 4C ) and through global analysis of the average effects at enhancers and TSSs A B C D E S upe r - enhan c e r s S upe r - enhan c e r s l u c i f e r a s e Super - enhancers Figure 2 .

JQ1 treatment led to (cid:1) 60 % reduction in BRD4 signal at enhancers and (cid:1) 90 % reduction at promoters ( Fig - ure 4D ) . The reduction in BRD4 was more profound at super - enhancers such as those associated with IgH - MYC and CCND2 ( Figure 4E ) , where the loss of BRD4 was nearly com - plete . We conclude that BET bromodomain inhibition of BRD4 A B Figure 3 .

S cells . Transcription of Super - Enhancer - Associated Genes Is Highly Sensitive to BRD4 Inhibition Enhancers are formed through cooperative and synergistic bind - ing of multiple transcription factors and coactivators ( Carey , 1998 ; Carey et al . , 1990 ; Giese et al . , 1995 ; Kim and Maniatis , 1997 ; Thanos and Maniatis , 1995 ) . As a consequence of this binding behavior , enhancers bound by many cooperatively inter - acting factors lose activity more rapidly than enhancers bound by fewer factors when the levels of enhancer - bound factors are reduced ( Giniger and Ptashne , 1988 ; Griggs and Johnston , 1991 ) . The presence of super - enhancers at MYC and other key genes associated with MM led us to consider the hypothesis that super - enhancers are more sensitive to reduced levels of BRD4 than typical enhancers and that genes associated with super - enhancers might then experience a greater reduction of transcription than genes with average enhancers when BRD4 is inhibited ( Figure 5A ) . To test this hypothesis , we ﬁrst examined the effects of various concentrations of JQ1 on BRD4 occupancy genome wide ( Fig - ure 5B ) . JQ1 had little effect on MM1 . S cell viability when treated for 6 hr at these various concentrations , whereas at later time points , JQ1 had a signiﬁcant antiproliferative effect ( Figure 5C ) . As expected , MYC protein levels were signiﬁcantly depleted by exposure of MM1 . S cells to 50 nM or greater doses of JQ1 for 6 hr ( Figure 6D ) ( Delmore et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , JQ1 did not affect total BRD4 protein levels within the cells and did not signif - icantly reduce ChIP efﬁciency ( Figure 5E ) . When BRD4 occu - pancy was examined genome wide in cells exposed to increasing concentrations of JQ1 , it was evident that super - en - hancers showed a greater loss of BRD4 occupancy than typical enhancer regions ( Figure 5F ) . For example , the IgH super - enhancer showed signiﬁcantly greater reduction in BRD4 occu - pancy in cells treated with 5 nM or 50 nM JQ1 than typical enhancer regions such as that upstream of SMARCA4 ( Fig - ure 5G ) . Ultimately , virtually all BRD4 occupancy was lost at the IgH super - enhancer ( 97 % reduction versus DMSO control ) A B C D E Figure 4 .

We next investigated whether genes associated with super - enhancers might experience a greater reduction of transcription than genes with average enhancers when BRD4 is inhibited . As expected , treatment of MM1 . S cells with 500 nM JQ1 led to pro - gressive reduction in global messenger RNA ( mRNA ) levels over time ( Figures 6A and S3A ) . Similarly , treatment with increasing concentrations of JQ1 caused progressive reductions in global mRNA levels ( Figures 6A and S3B ) . There was a selective deple - tion of mRNAs from super - enhancer - associated genes that occurred in both temporal ( Figure 6B ) and concentration - depen - dent manners ( Figure 6C ) . Notably , MYC and IRF4 mRNA levels were more rapidly depleted than other mRNAs that are expressed at similar levels ( Figure 6D ) . The levels of transcripts from super - enhancer - associated genes were somewhat more affected than those from genes that have multiple typical enhancers bound by BRD4 ( Figures S3C and S3D ) . Thus , BET bromodomain inhibition preferentially impacts transcription of super - enhancer - driven genes . To further test the model that super - enhancers are responsible for the special sensitivity to BRD4 inhibition , we transfected MM1 . S cells with luciferase reporter constructs containing super - enhancer and typical enhancer fragments and examined the effects of various JQ1 concentrations on luciferase activity . Upon treatment with JQ1 , MM1 . S cells transfected with a super - enhancerreporterexperiencedagreaterreductioninlucif - erase activity than those transfected with a typical enhancer reporter ( Figure 6E ) . Interestingly , the dose - response curve ob - served for luciferase activity of the super - enhancer construct is consistentwiththatexpectedforenhancersthatareboundcoop - eratively by multiple factors ( Figure 5A ) ( Giniger and Ptashne , 1988 ; Griggs and Johnston , 1991 ) . These results are also consis - tent with the model that super - enhancers are responsible for the special sensitivity of gene transcription to BRD4 inhibition . BRD4 Inhibition and Transcription Elongation At active genes , enhancers and core promoters are brought into close proximity , so factors associated with enhancers can act on the transcription apparatus in the vicinity of TSSs and thereby inﬂuence initiation or elongation . BRD4 is known to interact with Mediator and P - TEFb and to be involved in the control of transcriptional elongation by RNA Pol II ( Conaway and Conaway , 2011 ; Dawson et al . , 2011 ; Jang et al . , 2005 ; Krueger et al . , 2010 ; Rahman et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests that the preferential loss of BRD4 from super - enhancers might affect the levels of Mediator and P - TEFb at these sites and , further - more , that the reduced levels of mRNAs from super - enhancer - associated genes might be due to an effect on transcription elongation . To test these predictions , we carried out ChIP - seq for the Mediator component MED1 and the catalytic subunit of the P - TEFb complex CDK9 in MM1 . S cells treated with DMSO or 500 nM JQ1 for 6 hr . In control cells , MED1 and CDK9 were found at enhancers and promoters of active genes throughout the MM genome , as expected ( Figures 1A , 1B , and S3E ) . In cells treated with JQ1 , reduced levels of MED1 and CDK9 were observed primarily at enhancers , with the greatest loss at super - enhancers ( Figure 6F ) . As many super - enhancers span contiguous regions that encompass or overlap the TSS , we analyzed MED1 and CDK9 loss in either TSS proximal or TSS distal regions of super - enhancers and again observed loss of MED1 and CDK9 predominantly at TSS distal regions ( Figure S3F ) . We conclude that inhibition of BRD4 genomic binding leads to a marked reduction in the levels of Mediator and P - TEFb at genomic re - gions distal to TSSs , with the greatest reduction occurring at super - enhancers . To determine whether reduced levels of BRD4 lead to changes in transcription elongation , we quantiﬁed changes in transcrip - tion elongation by performing ChIP - seq of RNA Pol II before and after treatment of MM1 . S cells with 500 nM JQ1 . We then calculated the fold loss of RNA Pol II occupancy in the gene body regions for all transcriptionally active genes and found that more than half of these genes show a decrease in elongating RNA Pol II density after JQ1 treatment ( Figure 6G ) . Importantly , genes associated with super - enhancers showed a greater decrease of RNA Pol II in their elongating gene body regions compared to genes associated with typical enhancers ( Figures 6H and S3G ) . Inspection of individual gene tracks revealed pro - nounced elongation defects at super - enhancer - associated genes such as MYC and IRF4 , with the greatest effects observed with MYC ( Figures 6I and 6J ) . Thus , the selective effects of JQ1 on the transcription of MYC and other super - enhancer - associ - ated genes can be explained , at least in part , by the sensitivity of super - enhancers to reduced levels of BRD4 , which leads to a pronounced effect on pause release and transcription elongation . Super - Enhancers Are Associated with Disease - Critical Genes in Other Cancers To map enhancers and to determine whether super - enhancers occur in additional tumor types , we investigated the ge - nome - wide occupancy of Mediator ( MED1 ) , BRD4 , and the enhancer - associated histone modiﬁcation H3K27Ac using ChIP - seq in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) and small - cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) ( Figure 7 ) . Mediator ( MED1 ) occupancy was used to identify enhancer elements because enhancer - bound transcription factors bind directly to Mediator ( Borggrefe and Yue , 2011 ; Conaway and Conaway , 2011 ; Kornberg , 2005 ; Malik and Roeder , 2010 ; Taatjes , 2010 ) and because it has proven to produce high - quality evidence for enhancers in mammalian cells ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ) . Global occupancy of BRD4 and H3K27Ac was used as corroborative evidence to identify enhancer elements ( Figure S4 and Table S4 ) . Analysis of the regions occupied by Mediator revealed that , as in ( G ) Gene tracks of BRD4 ChIP - seq occupancy after various concentrations of JQ1 treatment at the IgH - MYC - associated super - enhancer ( left ) and the SMARCA4 - associated typical enhancer ( right ) .

S cells , large genomic domains were occupied by this co - activator in both GBM and SCLC ( Figures 7A , 7B , 7D , and 7E ) . The median super - enhancer was 30 kb in GBM cells and 11 kb in SCLC cells ( Figures 7B and 7E ) . As in MM1 . S cells , these GBM and SCLC super - enhancers were an order or magnitude larger and showed a commensurate increase in MED1 , BRD4 , and H3K27Ac levels when compared to normal enhancers ( Fig - ures 7B and 7E ) . The super - enhancers in GBM and SCLC were found to be associated with many well - known tumor - associated genes ( Fig - ures 7C and 7F and Table S5 ) . In GBM , super - enhancers were associated with genes encoding three transcription factors ( RUNX1 , FOSL2 , and BHLHE40 ) critical for mesenchymal trans - formation of brain tumors ( Carro et al . , 2010 ) ; the super - en - hancers associated with BHLHE40 are shown in Figure 7C . BCL3 , which associates with NF - k B and is deregulated in many blood and solid tumor types , is associated with a super - enhancer in GBM ( Figure 7C ) ( Maldonado and Melendez - Zajgla , 2011 ) . In SCLC , a super - enhancer is associated with the INSM1 gene , which encodes a transcription factor involved in neuronal development that is highly expressed in neuroendocrine tissue and tumors such as SCLC ( Figure 7F ) ( Pedersen et al . , 2003 ) . A super - enhancer is also associated with the ID2 gene , which is highly expressed in SCLCs and encodes a protein that inter - acts with the well - known retinoblastoma tumor suppressor ( Fig - ure 7F ) ( Pedersen et al . , 2003 ; Perk et al . , 2005 ) . These results indicate that super - enhancers are likely to associate with critical tumor oncogenes in diverse tumor types . DISCUSSION Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy , but many of these regulators are expressed in a broad range of healthy cells and contribute generally to gene expres - sion . Thus , it is unclear how inhibition of a global chromatin regu - lator such as BRD4 might produce selective effects , such as at the MYC oncogene ( Delmore et al . , 2011 ) . We have found that key regulators of tumor cell state in MM1 . S cells are associated with large enhancer domains , characterized by disproportion - ately high levels of BRD4 and Mediator . These super - enhancers are more sensitive to perturbation than typical enhancers , and the expression of the genes associated with super - enhancers is preferentially affected . Thus , the preferential loss of BRD4 at super - enhancers associated with the MYC oncogene and other key tumor - associated genes can explain the gene - selective effects of JQ1 treatment in these cells . BRD4 is an excellent example of a chromatin regulator that is expressed in a broad range of healthy cells and contributes generally to gene expression . Most cell types for which RNA - seq data are available express the BRD4 gene . ChIP - seq data revealed that BRD4 generally occupies the enhancer and pro - moter elements of active genes with the Mediator coactivator in MM1 . S cells ( Figure 1 ) . These results eliminate the model that BRD4 is exclusively associated with a small set of genes that are thereby rendered inactive by the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 and instead suggest that the gene - speciﬁc effects of the small molecule have other causes . We have found that (cid:1) 3 % of the enhancers in MM1 . S cells are exceptionally large and are occupied by remarkably high amounts of BRD4 and Mediator . These super - enhancers are generally an order of magnitude larger and contain an order of magnitude more BRD4 , Mediator , and histone marks associated with enhancers ( H3K27Ac ) than typical enhancers . Our results suggest that super - enhancers are collections of closely spaced enhancers that can collectively facilitate high levels of transcrip - tion from adjacent genes . Importantly , the super - enhancers are associated with the MYC oncogene and additional genes such as IGLL5 , IRF4 , PRDM1 / BLIMP - 1 , and XBP1 that feature prom - inently in MM biology . Cooperative and synergistic binding of multiple transcription factors and coactivators occurs at enhancers . Enhancers bound by many cooperatively interacting factors can lose activity more rapidly than enhancers bound by fewer factors when the levels of enhancer - bound factors are reduced ( Giniger and Ptashne , 1988 ; Griggs and Johnston , 1991 ) . The presence of super - en - hancers at MYC and other key genes associated with MM led us to test the hypothesis that super - enhancers are more sensi - tive to reduced levels of BRD4 than average enhancers .

In addition , this decrease in BRD4 occupancy is accompanied by a corresponding loss of MED1 and CDK9 at super - enhancers . Consequent transcription elongation defects and mRNA decreases preferentially impact super - enhancer - associated genes , with an especially profound effect at the MYC oncogene . Super - enhancers are notrestricted to MM cells . We have iden - tiﬁed super - enhancers in two additional tumor types , small - cell lung cancer and glioblastoma multiforme . Super - enhancers identiﬁed in these cell types have characteristics similar to those found in MM1 . S ; they span large genomic regions and contain exceptional amounts of Mediator and BRD4 . These super - enhancers are also associated with important tumor genes in both cell types . In GBM cells , BHLHE40 and BCL3 are known to be important in tumor biology and are each associated with super - enhancers in this cell type . In H2171 SCLC cells , super - enhancers are associated with INSM1 and ID2 , which are frequently overexpressed in SCLC . In fact , super - enhancers are not restricted to tumor cells and have been identiﬁed in several additional cell types in which they similarly associate with key cell identity genes ( Whyte et al . , 2013 [ this issue of Cell ] ) . Our results demonstrate that super - enhancers occupied by BRD4 regulate critical oncogenic drivers in MM and show that BRD4 inhibition leads to preferential disruption of these super - enhancers . This insight into the mechanism by which BRD4 inhi - bition causes selective loss of oncogene expression in this highly malignant blood cancer may have implications for future drug development in oncology . Tumor cells frequently become addicted to oncogenes , thus becoming unusually reliant on high - level expression of these genes ( Cheung et al . , 2011 ; Chin et al . , 1999 ; Felsher and Bishop , 1999 ; Garraway and Sellers , 2006 ; Garraway et al . , 2005 ; Jain et al . , 2002 ; Weinstein , 2002 ) . Thus , preferential disruption of super - enhancer function may be a general approach to selectively inhibiting the oncogenic drivers of many tumor cells . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture MM1 .
