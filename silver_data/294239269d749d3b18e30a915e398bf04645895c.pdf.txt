Vol . 216 No . 12 3981 – 3990 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201704085 Introduction Epiblast cavity formation is essential for the morphogenesis and survival of the embryo as it implants in the uterine wall . However , because of ethical concerns , this event remains dif - ficult to study in the human embryo . Recently , two groups demonstrated that cultured human blastocysts , generated by in vitro fertilization , can self - organize and polarize to form lumenal proamniotic cavities in the absence of cues from ma - ternal tissues ( Deglincerti et al . , 2016 ; Shahbazi et al . , 2016 ) . However , limited availability of such in vitro fertilization samples and the inability to perform mechanistic analyses in this type of model continue to hinder studies of peri - implan - tation human development . Studies from our laboratory and others reveal that the property of self - organization extends to singly plated human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) , which readily polarize to form cysts ( hPSC cyst ) with a central apically marked lumen upon the first cell division ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ; Shahbazi et al . , 2016 ) . During further mitotic expansion of such cysts , all cells retain expression of pluripotency markers . Thus , this process re - sembles expansion of the lumenal epiblast ( proamniotic ) cavity of cultured human embryos , and it has been suggested that the molecular pathways driving the polarization of hPSCs in culture may also be involved in epiblast cavity formation in vivo ( Tani - guchi et al . , 2015 ; Shahbazi et al . , 2016 ; Simunovic and Brivan - lou , 2017 ) . Indeed , we recently demonstrated that such hPSC cysts can give rise to squamous amnion - like cells as well as postimplantation amniotic sac – like structures when grown in a specifically engineered environment ( Shao et al . , 2017a , b ) , fur - ther demonstrating that hPSC cysts self - organize to recapitulate developmental processes associated with the epiblast in vivo . Although hPSCs indeed display an intrinsic ability to ef - ficiently form lumenal cysts , it is not clear how apical polariza - tion initiates in this model . Here , we show that lumen formation begins on the interior of single cells , with the formation of an apicosome : a highly organized intracellular membrane - bound apical lumenal compartment studded with microvilli and a pri - mary cilium . Time - lapse imaging reveals that the apicosome forms de novo during interphase . In single cells , the apicosome survives through mitosis , is asymmetrically inherited upon cy - tokinesis , and relocates to the cytokinetic plane following cyto - kinesis . When hPSCs are plated as aggregates rather than single cells , apicosomes generated in multiple individual cells fuse to generate a single central lumen . We conclude that the apicosome is a major driver of epiblast - like lumen formation in hPSC . Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) self - organize into apicobasally polarized cysts , reminiscent of the lumenal epiblast stage , providing a model to explore key morphogenic processes in early human embryos . Here , we show that apical polarization begins on the interior of single hPSCs through the dynamic formation of a highly organized perinuclear apicosome structure . The membrane surrounding the apicosome is enriched in apical markers and displays microvilli and a primary cilium ; its lumenal space is rich in Ca 2 + . Time - lapse imaging of isolated hPSCs reveals that the apicosome forms de novo in interphase , retains its structure during mitosis , is asymmetrically inherited after mitosis , and relocates to the recently formed cytokinetic plane , where it establishes a fully polarized lumen . In a multicellular aggregate of hPSCs , intracellular apicosomes from multiple cells are trafficked to generate a common lumenal cavity . Thus , the apico - some is a unique preassembled apical structure that can be rapidly used in single or clustered hPSCs to initiate self - organized apical polarization and lumenogenesis .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 12 • 2017 3982 Results and discussion Formation of an intracellular apically enriched perinuclear complex in dissociated hPSCs To identify the earliest sign of apical polarization during hPSC lumen formation , we first examined the initial stages of this process in dissociated single hPSCs . 20 h after plating singly isolated H9 ( WA09 ) cells in the presence of the rho - associated kinase inhibitor ( ROCK - i ) , Y - 27632 ( essential for preventing apoptosis associated with cellular dissociation ) , 45 . 33 ± 2 . 4 % of the cells had divided , and the majority ( > 60 % ) of two - cell clones showed a single central lumen , centered within the re - cently formed cytokinetic plane . The lumen was enriched in api - cal proteins , including F - ACT IN ( phalloidin + ) and EZR IN ( an actin - binding protein ) , as previously reported ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) . Of the remaining undivided single cells , 40 % contained a perinuclear accumulation of multiple apical markers : F - ACT IN , EZR IN , phosphorylated EZR IN / RAD IXIN / MOE SIN ( p - ERM ) , atypical PKC ζ ( aPKC ζ ) , and POD OCA LYX IN ( POD XL ; Fig . 1 , A – C ; Bryant et al . , 2010 ; Rodríguez - Fraticelli and Martín - Belmonte , 2013 ; Rodriguez - Boulan and Macara , 2014 ) . This apically enriched structure was membranous , as revealed by WGA staining , a marker for outer cell membrane ( Fig . 1 A and Fig . S1 A ) . The tight junction marker ZO1 was also associ - ated with this perinuclear complex , and the entire structure was surrounded by the basolateral protein E - CAD HER IN ( Fig . 1 D ) . Time - course analysis revealed that the number of single cells containing an EZR IN + perinuclear complex increased from < 5 % at 30 min after plating single cells to > 40 % at 20 h ( Fig . S1 B ) . The EZR IN + structure was entirely intracellular , as optical sectioning ( y - z plane ) of phalloidin - stained cells demonstrated no obvious connections to the extracellular milieu ( Fig . 1 E ) . Importantly , nuclear expression of the pluripotency markers NAN OG and POU5F1 was maintained in cells containing this apical structure ( Fig . S1 C ) . A similar structure also forms in H7 ( WA07 ) and the 1196a human induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) line ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) as well as in H9 cells grown in several different media formulations and substrates that are used to culture hPSCs , including a recently described laminin - 521 / E - cadherin matrix substrate that sustains pluripotency and the viability of singly isolated hPSCs in the absence of ROCK - i ( Rodin et al . , 2014b ; Fig . S1 , D – H ) . hPSCs share similar developmental and epigenetic characteristics with epiblast cells of peri - implantation mouse embryos ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ; De Los Angeles et al . , 2015 ) . Inter - estingly , a recent analysis of polarization in mouse blastocysts revealed apicosome - like intracellular accumulations of Podxl ( see Fig . 4 A in Bedzhov and Zernicka - Goetz , 2014 ) . We con - firmed those observations in E4 . 5 mouse blastocysts ( Fig . S1 I and Video 1 ; 7 of 16 cells ) . However , no such intracellular apical protein accumulations were seen in blastocysts at E3 . 5 and E4 . 0 ( Fig . S1 J ) . To further examine this stage - specific for - mation of apicosome - like structure , we examined whether such structures form in isolated mouse epiblast stem cells ( mEpiSCs ; epiblast - like ) as well as in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESC ; inner cell mass - like ) .

Apicosome drives hPSC polarization and lumenogenesis • Taniguchi et al . 3983 aPKC ζ , surrounded by recycling endosome ( Rab11 ) and Golgi ( GM130 ) , were readily seen in sparsely plated , dissociated mE - piSCs but not in mESCs ( Fig . S1 K ) . Thus , formation of these apically enriched intracellular structures is a fundamental prop - erty of singly plated hPSC as well as mouse epiblast cells . The apically enriched complex is a distinct intracellular compartment To determine the relationship between the apicosome and other cellular organelles , we stained sparsely plated H9 hESCs with markers of the nuclear membrane ( LAM IN A / C ) , ER ( CAL NEX IN ) , Golgi ( GM130 ) , mitochondria ( COX IV ) , lysosome ( lysosomal - associated membrane protein [ LAMP ] 1 ) , auto - phagosome ( sequestosome [ SQS TM ] 1 ) , and microtubule ( α - TUB ULIN ; Fig . 1 F and Fig . S2 A ; see Fig . S2 , B and C , for individual channels and additional cells ) . The apicosome ( marked by WGA or p - ERM ) was surrounded by many of these markers but did not costain substantially with any of them ( Fig . 1 F and Fig . S2 , B and C ) . Additionally , the apicosome was surrounded by but not colocalized with early endosomes ( RAB5 ) , recycling endosomes ( RAB11 and ADP - ribosylation factor [ ARF ] 6 ) , and late endosomes ( RAB7 ; Fig . 1 G ; also see Fig . S2 , D and E ) . Together , these results demonstrate that sin - gle hPSCs readily form a previously unrecognized highly or - ganized perinuclear complex , hereafter called the apicosome . The apicosomal membrane surrounds a lumen with extracellular features Ultrastructural analyses of isolated H9 cells revealed that the apicosome consists of a membrane - bound lumen with a diame - ter of 3 – 5 µm ( Fig . 2 A ) . Strikingly , the demarcating membrane is studded with microvillus - like protrusions ( Fig . 2 A ) that are highly dynamic , as evident from live imaging of cells expressing EZR IN – GFP fusion protein ( Video 2 ) . In some cells , a primary cilium was observed ( Fig . 2 , B and B - i ) : staining single H9 cells with ADP - ribosylation factor - like protein [ ARL ] 13B ( Sun et al . , 2004 ) , a primary cilium marker , showed that a single pri - mary cilium existed within the apicosome in 86 . 6 ± 5 . 8 % ( n = 3 ) of the cells containing large ( > 3 µm ) apicosomes ( Fig . 2 C ) but not in cells containing small apicosomes ( Fig . S2 F ) . Consistent with this observation , centrosomes ( γ - TUB ULIN ) were closely associated with the apicosome ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , the membrane demarcating the apicosome has physical characteristics of the exterior surface of the cell ( microvilli , cilia ) . Because the phys - iological level of Ca 2 + is markedly higher in the extracellular environment ( 1 – 3 mM ) than within cells ( 100 nm to 1 µM ; Hao et al . , 2016 ) , we examined the level of Ca 2 + in the apicosome using Fluo - 3 - AM , a cell - permeable fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator . The Fluo - 3 signal was visible as expected in the ER through - out the cells ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . However , the Fluo - 3 signal was particularly robust inside the apicosome ( Fig . 2 E ) , suggesting active accumulation of Ca 2 + in this compartment . Collectively , these results suggest that the apicosome provides a fully polar - ized , membrane - bound lumenal compartment with extracellular characteristics inside of single hPSCs ( Fig . 2 F ) . Straight and branched actin assembly pathways are required for apicosome formation We previously demonstrated that the formation of lumens in two - cell hESC clones is dependent on actin assembly path - ways ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , interruption of either Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin assembly or mDIA1 / formin - dependent straight actin filament assembly reduces the number and size of two cell lumens . Because , similar to the two - cell lumen , the apicosome structure is highly actin enriched ( Fig . 1 ) , Figure 2 . The apicosome has features of the cellular exterior .

Indeed , treatment with either the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) or the mDIA / formin in - hibitor SMI FH2 ( Rizvi et al . , 2009 ) reduced the number of apicosomes in singly plated hESCs ( Fig . S2 , G and H ) . Con - versely , overexpression of full - length MDIA1 ( MDIA1 - FL ) or a constitutively active truncated form of MDIA1 ( MDIA1 - δ N3 ; Sakamoto et al . , 2012 ) increased apicosome generation com - pared with controls ( Fig . S2 I ) . Thus , actin assembly pro - grams play a critical role in both apicosome formation and two - cell lumen generation . Dynamics of apicosome formation and trafficking in single cells To examine how the apicosome is generated in single cells and to follow the fate of this structure during cell division , live cell imaging was performed using cells expressing EZR IN – or POD XL – GFP . Time - lapse imaging resulted in occasional cell death , likely due to phototoxicity . Thus , only cells that success - fully completed mitosis during imaging were considered : 120 cells labeled with EZR IN – GFP as well as 53 cells labeled with POD XL – GFP were followed ( in at least three separate imaging experiments for each marker ) . As early as 30 min after plating , a small concentrated perinuclear EZR IN – GFP signal ( Fig . 3 A and Video 3 ) appeared de novo . Over the next 4 – 6 h , this sig - nal increased in size and intensity , revealing dynamic growth of the apicosome , until the cell enters mitosis ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S3 A ) . For cells expressing POD XL – GFP , scattered small POD XL – GFP foci can be seen throughout cytoplasm immedi - ately after plating . Over the course of the next 1 – 2 h , these foci organize into a single perinuclear structure ( Fig . 3 B , Fig . S3 B , and Video 3 ; see Fig . 3 , C and D , and Video 4 for short - term high - resolution imaging and quantitation ) . To directly test whether these POD XL + foci are de - rived from the preexisting apical domain , hESC monolayers were incubated with mTeSR containing ATTO 657N – labeled mCLI NG ( membrane - binding fluorophore - cysteine - lysine - palmitoyl group ) membrane dye for 30 min before dissociation ( Revelo et al . , 2014 ) . Immediately after individual cell replating and attachment , mCLI NG signal was indeed colocalized with some ( but not all ) of the POD XL + vesicles ( Fig . 3 E ) ; p - ERM signal was absent from these early vesicular collections . With time , apicosome structures became POD XL + and p - ERM + ; dif - fuse mCLI NG signal was detectable in these assembled apico - some structures ( Fig . 3 , E and E - i ) . Thus , at least part of the membrane pool within the apicosome is derived from the pre - existing apical surface . The diffuse mCLI NG signal within the apicosome led us to additionally examine membrane dynamics within the apicosome using FRAP . Apicosomes labeled with EZR IN – or POD XL – GFP showed rapid fluorescence recovery after laser photo - bleaching ( Fig . S3 , C – E ; and Videos 5 and 6 ) , indicative of ac - tive membrane trafficking at the apicosome . Collectively , these results show that the apicosome forms de novo on the interior of single cells , growing and maturing with time via dynamic membrane trafficking ( Fig . 3 F ) . The high background in EZR IN – GFP – labeled cells made it difficult to track the apicosome during mitotic cell rounding using this label . Of 120 individual cells tracked through the entire process of cell division , the EZR IN – GFP - labeled apico - some could be followed throughout the entire mitotic process in only 25 ( 20 . 8 % ; Fig . 4 A and Video 7 ) . In contrast , POD XL – GFP – labeled apicosomes could be tracked in 53 of 56 cells ( 94 % ; Fig . 4 B and Video 8 ) . Strikingly , after cytokinesis , the single apicosome was asymmetrically inherited by one daugh - ter cell in all 25 of the tracked EZR IN – GFP cells ( Fig . 4 A , cy - tokinesis at 01 : 00 ) and in 41 of 53 ( 77 % ) of the POD XL – GFP cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . In the remaining 10 of 53 POD XL – GFP cells , the label appeared to distribute to both daughters as cytokinesis ensued . Immunostained sections confirmed that apicosome - like EZR IN + , aPKC ζ + , and POD XL + domains were present through - out the mitotic cycle in cells expressing either label ( Fig . 4 , C and D ; and Fig . S3 F ) . Despite the asymmetric inheritance of the apicosome , both daughters remained positive for POU5F1 ( Fig . 4 C , see cytokinetic cells in EZR IN / POU5F1 staining ) . Extended tracking showed that for all cells in which the EZR IN – or POD XL – GFP + structure was still visible , this structure moved to a position near the cytokinetic plane between the two daughter cells within 1 – 2 h after the com - pletion of cell division ( Fig . 4 , A [ 01 : 00 – 3 : 20 ] and B [ 01 : 30 – 03 : 00 ] ; see additional cells in Fig . S3 G ) . This structure was surrounded by RAB11 + recycling endosomes in postmitotic cells , though RAB11 did not show prominent association with the apicosome during mitosis ( Fig . S3 H ) . Further analysis revealed intermediates in which the apicosome was directly adjacent to , or in contact with , the cytokinetic plane in two - cell clones ( Fig . 4 , E and F ; and see Fig . S3 I ) . Thus , after mitosis , asymmetrically segregated apicosomes relocate to the cytokinetic plane , where they give rise to fully demar - cated lumens ( Fig . 4 G ) . The fate of all individual tracked cells is shown in Table S1 . Lumens formed after mitosis in 84 . 78 % or 90 % of cells ex - hibiting apicosome structures labeled with POD XL – or EZR IN – GFP , respectively . Occasionally , cells completed cytokinesis without first forming an apicosome , and no lumen was initially visible ( Fig . S3 J ) . Then , an apicosome appeared in one daughter and was subsequently relocated to the cytokinetic plane to form a lumen ( Video 9 ) . Thus , in all tracked cases , apicosome for - mation preceded lumenogenesis in individually plated hPSCs . Apicosomes drive lumen formation in hPSC aggregates In the blastocyst , pluripotent embryonic cells exist initially as an unpolarized aggregate of cells . Their first clear morphogenic activity is to undergo apicobasal polarization that results in ra - dial organization of epiblast cells and formation of a lumen in the center of the resulting rosette to generate an epiblast cavity ( mouse ) or proamniotic cavity ( human ) . We therefore explored whether aggregates of hESCs would recapitulate this type of organization and whether apicosomes are involved ( Fig . 5 ) . Cells were plated at a density that yielded small cell aggregates in mTeSR1 medium containing Y - 27632 ( ROCK - i ) for the first 24 h ; the medium was then changed to mTeSR1 supplemented with 2 % Geltrex without ROCK - i for another 24 h ( Shao et al . , 2017a ; Fig . 5 A ) . After culture for 24 h with ROCK - i , 44 . 9 ± 7 . 6 % ( n = 3 ) of cells in each aggregate exhibited an intracellular concentration of apical markers , including POD XL , aPKC ζ , p - ERM , and EZR IN that did not show obvious colocalization with the E - CAD HER IN + cell membrane ( Fig . 5 , B – E , top row , 0 h groups ; higher magnification images in Fig . S3 L ) . This apically po - larized complex was surrounded by RAB11 + early endosomes ( Fig . 5 D and Fig . S3 L ) and was studded with a single primary cilium in more than half ( 54 . 2 ± 2 . 5 % , n = 3 ) of cases ( Fig . 5 E Apicosome drives hPSC polarization and lumenogenesis • Taniguchi et al . 3985 and Fig . S3 L ; quantitation in Fig . S3 M ) . Thus , apicosomes form inside individual hPSCs in the context of cell aggregates . By 6 h after ROCK - i withdrawal , many cells within the aggregates were oriented radially , and apicosomes were gath - ered near the center of the radially oriented cells ( Fig . 5 , B – E , center rows , + 6 h , see dotted circles in green channels ) . Costain - ing for E - CAD HER IN and ARL13B confirmed their intracellu - lar nature and revealed that > 40 % ( 46 . 9 ± 5 . 9 % , n = 3 ) of these apicosomes continued to exhibit a single primary cilium ( Fig . 5 , C , E - i , and E - ii ; and quantitation in Fig . S3 M ) . Occasionally , apically charged structures with two or more cilia could be de - tected ( 17 . 3 ± 5 . 7 % , n = 3 , Fig . S3 M , see red bars in double and triple + categories ) . These structures appear to represent true lumens , as the presence of at least two cilia indicates that they are shared by two or more cells ( Fig . 5 , E and E - ii , arrowheads ) . At 24 h after ROCK - i withdrawal , most aggregates consisted of a single cyst with one or multiple dominant lumens that were decorated by multiple cilia ( 32 . 8 ± 0 . 7 % , n = 3 ) . Addition - ally , the total number of intracellular , single - cilium apicosome structures per independent aggregate was significantly reduced over time ( Fig . S3 N ) . Thus , when plated as aggregates , hESCs self - organize to form cysts with a central lumen , and this is con - comitant with apicosome fusion and cell rearrangement . The foregoing analysis suggests a dynamic process of apicosome formation and fusion . To track this process in live cells , POD XL – GFP hESC aggregates were followed using Figure 3 .

Consistent with the immunostaining re - sults , multiple cells within each aggregate contained a POD XL + apicosome ( 75 . 8 ± 6 . 1 % , n = 3 ) at 24 h after plating ( Fig . 5 F and Video 10 ) . The higher apicosome frequency seen with POD XL ( 75 . 8 % ) versus EZR IN ( 44 . 8 % ) tracking likely reflects the fact that the POD XL label detects preapicosomes that are not yet decorated with EZR IN . Shortly after ROCK - i withdrawal , many cells within the aggregate retracted their protruding pro - cesses and compacted with neighboring cells , condensing the colony within 2 – 3 h ( Fig . 5 F , 03 : 00 ) . Over the next 3 – 4 h , cells began to orient radially , and POD XL + apicosomes actively ac - cumulated at the center of these rosette - like structures ( Fig . 5 F , 07 : 00 ) . By 9 – 11 h after ROCK - i withdrawal , several apico - somes fused to give rise to a common lumen ( Fig . 5 F , 11 : 00 ) . Often , after formation of a dominant lumen , apicosomes in cells on the outskirts of an aggregate began to merge to form a second lumen ; multiple fusion events could occur sequentially to give rise to the final shared lumen ( Fig . 5 F and Video 10 ) . Quantitation showed that > 40 % ( 41 . 9 ± 6 . 09 % , n = 3 ) of the independent aggregates formed multiple lumens that fused and gave rise to the final shared lumen by 48 h after ROCK - i withdrawal . Together , these results demonstrate that both in the context of single isolated hPSC and in the context of cell aggre - gates , apicosomes function as lumenal precursors . Together , the data presented here establish evidence for a novel type of lumen formation in human and mouse PSC that involves the actin cytoskeleton – dependent formation of an api - cosome , a highly organized intracellular structure with lumenal attributes . In both single cells and in cell aggregates , delivery of the apicosome to the cell surface results in a fully formed lumen that is shared by two or more cells , establishing the apicosome as a critical driver of lumenogenesis . Importantly , structures that resemble apicosomes have been previously observed in vivo in developing tissues , including the early mouse epiblast ( Bedzhov and Zernicka - Goetz , 2014 ) , as well as in other de - veloping organs , such as the embryonic thyroid ( Hick et al . , 2013 ) and pancreas ( Kesavan et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , a variety of tumor cells exhibit intracellular lumen - like structures that are studded with microvilli and located in the vicinity of the nu - cleus ( Battifora , 1975 ; Tsuchiya , 1981 ; Remy , 1986 ; Quincey et al . , 1991 ; Gilloteaux et al . , 2016 ) , though the molecular char - acteristics of these structures and their potential relationship to Figure 4 .

Apicosome drives hPSC polarization and lumenogenesis • Taniguchi et al . 3987 apicosomes remains to be carefully examined . It will be im - portant to explore whether the process of apicosome - dependent lumenogenesis is limited to less differentiated cell types such as those seen in development and cancer . Overall , we demon - strate that the self - organization of hPSC aggregates into lume - nal cysts via apicosome trafficking is a biologically relevant process and that this in vitro system provides a valuable model for its further analysis .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 12 • 2017 3988 were dissociated partially with 0 . 05 % trypsin ( 25300 - 054 ; Invitrogen ) . The partial dissociates were plated individually into a 1 . 9 - cm 2 well con - taining MEF feeder layer and cultured for additional 4 – 6 d in K15F5 medium . Cells were then dissociated gently by brief exposure ( 2 – 3 min ) to 0 . 05 % trypsin / EDTA with gentle pipetting to prevent complete single - cell dissociation of pluripotent clusters and plated into a 9 . 6 - cm 2 well containing MEF feeders in K15F5 medium . Morphologically distinct mEpiSC colonies appeared over the next 4 – 8 d . mEpiSC colo - nies were manually dissociated into small clusters using a glass needle and plated into 1 . 9 - cm 2 wells containing MEF feeders in mEpiSC cell medium consisting of knockout DMEM supplemented with 20 % KSR , 2 mM Glutamax ( 35050061 ; GIB CO ) , 1× nonessential amino acids , 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , and 10 ng / ml FGF2 ( R & D Systems ) . hPSC apicosome formation assays The hESC and human iPSC lines were cultured and maintained as previously described ( Ludwig et al . , 2006 ) , using lactate dehydroge - nase – elevating virus - free hESC - qualified Geltrex ( Life Technologies ; derived from reduced growth factor ECM , extracted from murine En - gelbreth - Holm - Swarm sarcoma cells similar to Matrigel ) to prepare ECM - coated coverslips . Glass coverslips were coated with 1 % Geltrex for 1 h at room temperature . To prepare singly dissociated hPSCs , the hPSC monolayer was dissociated using Accutase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min and triturated using a P1000 pipetman to ensure complete dis - sociation into single cells . Cells were then resuspended in DMEM / F12 , centrifuged , resuspended in mTeSR1 ( Stem Cell Technologies ) con - taining 10 µM Y - 27632 ( EMD Millipore ) and 2 % Geltrex , and plated at 5 , 000 cells / cm 2 on 1 % Geltrex – coated coverslips . To test alternative substrates , some experiments were performed using dissociated cells , plated sparsely in mTeSR1 on coverslips thinly coated with 1 % Geltrex , Matrigel ( diluted as suggested by the manufacturer ; Corning ) , or 10 μ g / ml vitronectin ( Trevigen ) . In some cases ( Fig . S1 G ) , cells were plated on irradiated MEFs at 20 , 000 cells / cm 2 . H9 cells used for analysis on MEFs had been historically maintained on MEFs . Laminin - 521 / E - cad - herin matrix substrate was generated as previously described using 15 µg / ml laminin - 521 ( Stem Cell Technologies ) and 1 . 7 µg / ml E - cadherin ( R & D Systems ; Rodin et al . , 2014a ) . H9 cells used for analysis on laminin - 521 / E - cadherin matrix were transferred from Geltrex feeder - free system and were maintained on laminin - 521 substrate for at least three passages before performing the apicosome formation assay . Endocytosis assay 5 - d hESC monolayer was treated with 0 . 4 µM mCLI NG - ATTO647N ( 710006AT1 ; Synaptic Systems ) for 30 min at 37°C . Cells were then washed with DMEM / F12 before starting the apicosome formation assay . Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde / 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde solution ( Revelo et al . , 2014 ) before immunofluorescent staining . hPSC aggregate lumen formation assays Upon single - cell dissociation ( as described for the apicosome forma - tion assays ) , cells were resuspended in mTeSR1 containing 10 µM Y - 27632 ( ROCK - i ) and plated at 30 , 000 cells / cm 2 on 1 % Geltrex – coated coverslips . After 24 h , cells were then incubated in mTeSR1 medium containing 2 % Geltrex ECM overlay without ROCK - i . Confocal microscopy An A - 1 confocal microscope ( Nikon ; equipped with Plan Fluor 40× Oil DIC H N2 [ NA 1 . 3 ] , Plan Apo VC 60× Oil DIC N2 [ NA 1 . 4 ] , Plan Apo VC 60×A WI DIC N2 [ NA 1 . 2 ] objective lenses , and NIS Elements Confocal software ) or a Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope ( Olym - pus ; equipped with 60× supercorrected PLA PON 60XOSC [ NA 1 . 4 ] objective and FV10 - ASW software ) was used . Live cell imaging and FRAP assay For long - term live cell imaging , EZR IN – or POD XL – GFP – expressing hESCs ( see cloning in the Constructs and cell lines section ) prepared for the apicosome formation assay or the aggregate lumen formation assay were plated on six - well plates ( Nunc ) in mTeSR1 medium ( Stem Cell Technologies ) , and time - lapse images were taken at 37°C using the IncuCyte Zoom live cell imaging system ( Essen Bioscience ) . Alter - natively , cells were plated on a glass bottom culture dish ( MatTek ) in mTeSR1 medium ( Stem Cell Technologies ) and were imaged in a Live - Cell chamber ( Pathology Devices ) configured for an A - 1 or Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope at 37°C . Live ER - Tracker ( E34250 ; Invitro - gen ) staining was performed as described in the manufacturer’s manual . FRAP was performed using a Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope with a SIM scanner using POD XL – GFP cells growing in mTeSR1 medium ( Stem Cell Technologies ) at 37°C . Fig . S3 E is plotted using normal - ized fluorescent recovery values ( Higashi et al . , 2016 ) obtained from 10 quantitated cells . 3D reconstruction , volume rendering , and tracking analyses were performed using Imaris 7 . 6 ( Bitplane ) , and movies were generated using Imaris 7 . 6 and Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Live intracellular Ca 2 + imaging Single cells were plated as for the apicosome formation assay . After 16 – 20 h , cells were rinsed once with DMEM / F12 before incubation in mTeSR containing 1 . 5 μ M Fluo - 3 - AM ( F1242 ; Invitrogen ) for 30 min . Cells were then washed with DMEM / F12 to remove any residual mem - brane bound dyes and incubated for an additional 30 min in mTeSR alone to allow de - esterification . Stained cells were imaged in mTeSR1 medium ( Stem Cell Technologies ) at 37°C in a LiveCell chamber ( Pa - thology Devices ) configured for an A - 1 confocal microscope . Small - molecule inhibitor assays Cells were cultured with or without SMI FH2 and CK - 666 ( EMD Milli - pore ; concentration given in legends ) in standard culture conditions , con - taining ROCK - i . After 20 h , cells were fixed for downstream analysis .

Imaging was done using an A - 1 confocal microscope , and images were analyzed and generated using Imaris ( Bitplane ) , Pho - toshop CS6 ( Adobe ) , or ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) . All stained samples were mounted in 90 % glycerol ( in 1× PBS ) solution . Constructs and cell lines The piggyBac transposon system was used to prepare cell lines ex - pressing EZR IN – EGFP and POD XL – EGFP , using a procedure Apicosome drives hPSC polarization and lumenogenesis • Taniguchi et al . 3989 previously described ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) . EGFP – MDIA1 pig - gyBac constructs have been described previously ( Sakamoto et al . , 2012 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) . pEGFP - C1 - MDIA1 full - length or pEGFP - MDIA1 - DN3 constructs were obtained from S . Narumiya ( Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan ) . The coding sequence of mouse EZR IN ( IMA GE : 6826190 ) was PCR - amplified ( forward : 5 ′ - GCG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGC CCA AGC CAA TC - 3 ′ ; reverse : 5 ′ - CGG CGG CCG CTT ACT TGT ACA GCT CGTC - 3 ′ ) . Lifeact – mCherry ( 46357 ; Addgene ) was PCR - amplified ( forward : 5 ′ - GCG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGG GTG TCG CAG - 3 ′ ; reverse : 5 ′ - CGG CGG CCG CTT ACT TGT ACA GCT CGTC - 3 ′ ) . Membrane TdTomato ( 37351 ; Addgene ; Beier et al . , 2011 ) was PCR amplified ( forward : 5 ′ - GCG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGC TGT GCT GTA TGAG - 3 ′ ; reverse : 5 ′ - CGG CGG CCG CTT ACT TGT ACA GCT CGT CC - 3 ′ ) . pCMV6 - XL6 - human POD XL tran - script variant 1 ( NM _ 001018111 . 1 ; Origene ) was PCR - amplified ( forward : 5 ′ - GCG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGC GCT GCG CGC TGGC - 3 ′ ; reverse : 5 ′ - CGA CCG GTG GAT CCA AGA GGT GTG TGT CTT CC - 3 ′ ) . Amplified products were then subcloned into the pPBC AG - GFP piggyBac transposon vector ( Chen and LoTurco , 2012 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) digested with EcoRI and NotI ( mouse EZR IN – GFP , Life - act – mCherry , and membrane TdTomato ) and with EcoRI and AgeI ( human POD XL – GFP ) . PiggyBac transposon vectors were obtained from J . LoTurco ( University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT ) . Transfection was done as previously described ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) . Fluores - cence - activated cell sorting was performed to collect cells expressing specific fluorophores . Pooled transiently transfected cells were used in single cell assays using mDIA1 constructs ( Fig . S2 I ) . Transmission electron microscopy Cells in Fig . 2 A were grown on Thermanox coverslips . Cells in Fig . 2 B were plated on a tissue culture plate and were scraped and pelleted before processing . These samples were fixed with 2 . 5 % glu - taraldehyde in Sorenson’s phosphate buffer for 1 h and postfixed in 1 % osmium tetraoxide solution for 1 h . Samples were dehydrated in a series of EtOH solutions ( 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 90 % , 95 % , and 100 % ) for 5 min each and infiltrated with epoxy resin . These samples were then sectioned at 70 nm ( Ultracut E ; Reichert - Jung ) , placed on car - bon slotted grids , stained using uranyl acetate , and imaged using the Philips CM100 . Samples in Fig . 3 B were grown in a Geltrex feeder - free system , scraped off after the postfixation using osmium tetraoxide , centrifuged briefly , and embedded in HistoGel ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) before dehydration . These samples were imaged using a JEM 1400 - TEM ( JEOL ) . Quantitative analyses Graphs were generated using Prism 6 ( GraphPad Software ) , and Stu - dent’s t test was performed to assess significance . P > 0 . 05 was consid - ered nonsignificant ; P ≤ 0 . 05 was considered significant and marked with an asterisk . For Figs . S1 B and S2 ( G – I ) 50 cells were counted from three independent samples ( total 150 ) per condition or cell line . For all quantitation of fixed hPSC aggregate samples ( in Fig . 5 and Fig . S3 , M and N ) , 20 aggregates were analyzed per independent sample ( total 60 aggregates ) . For time - lapse imaging quantitation of POD XL – GFP aggregates , a total of 53 aggregates ( 20 in experiment 1 , 18 in experi - ment 2 , and 15 in experiment 3 ) were considered . For quantitation of apicosome formation in cells grown on laminin - 521 / E - cadherin sub - strate ( Fig . S1 H ) , 50 cells were counted from three independent samples ( total 150 ) . The values to plot the time - course graph in Fig . 3 D was obtained on the basis of the total volume of the central perinuclear POD XL + domain ( calculated using Imaris 7 . 6 ; Bitplane ) in Fig . 3 C ( volume rendered [ VR ] , high threshold + tracking ) . All experiments were re - peated two or three times . Blastocyst isolation and staining 3 . 5 - to 4 . 75 - dpc mouse blastocysts were recovered by flushing uteri with 1× PBS containing 6 mg / ml BSA and fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde with 0 . 05 % Tergitol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min at room temperature . Blastocysts were washed three times with 1× PBS containing 0 . 2 % Tween 20 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and then blocked using 1× PBS containing 5 % goat serum , 0 . 2 % Tween 20 , and 0 . 2 % Fish Skin Gelatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min at 37°C . Blastocyts were incubated with primary antibody for 60 min at 37°C , washed with 1× PBS - Tween three times , incubated in secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37°C , and then stained for DNA using Hoechst 33258 . At least 10 blastocysts were analyzed . Online supplemental material Fig .
