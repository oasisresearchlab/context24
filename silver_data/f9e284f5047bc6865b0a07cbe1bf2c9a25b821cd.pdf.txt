Just before gastrulation , the mammalian embryo consists of the epiblast , which gives rise to the fetus , and extra - embryonic tissues that supply essential developmental signals and nutrients 3 . Although in some lower vertebrates , such as amphibians , the asymmetry in RNA and protein distribution in the egg coupled with the location of sperm entry orients the anterior – posterior ( AP ) and dorsal – ventral axes , the choice of axis direction appears random in mammals 2 . Hence the question : how do the embryonic and extra - embryonic signalling pathways cooperate to ensure unique body coordinates ? In the mouse , WNT and NODAL initiate the primitive streak in the posterior epiblast , whereas their inhibitors help to specify the anterior fates 4 . One of the key sources of these inhibitors is the ante - rior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) whose failure to migrate results in a radially symmetric proximal streak 5 , 6 . However , the proper head induction requires the secretion of the WNT inhibitor DKK1 from the anterior axial endoderm rather than from the AVE 7 . Recent mouse embryonic stem cell ( mESC ) models of gastrulation ( gastru - loids ) showed that it is possible to induce asymmetric expression of the primitive streak protein BRACHYURY ( BRA ) either by using a small - molecule WNT agonist on mESC clusters 8 – 11 or by fusing mESCs with mouse extra - embryonic stem cells ( mExESCs ) in three dimensions ( 3D ) 12 – 14 . The extent to which these symmetry - breaking events are evo - lutionarily conserved and relevant to early human embryonic development is unknown . This question remains intriguing , as human embryos develop with a different architecture , and thus the shape and juxtaposition of tissues is different from the mouse . Furthermore , the capacity of the embryonic tissue alone to break symmetry is unclear . Studying human gastrulation and symmetry breaking directly remains extremely challenging , not only because of the current ethical guidelines but also because of the paucity of biological material 15 . Thus , synthetic models of human embryos provide the only alternative in addressing these questions . In a notable recent example , 3D monolayer spherical epithelia were gen - erated from human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) whose fraction , under certain mechanical conditions , displayed an asymmetric epi - blast – amnion morphology with the epiblast portion differentiating into BRA + cells , thus potentially mimicking gastrulation events 16 , 17 . The underlying molecular mechanism of directly induced AP pat - terning in humans is lacking . Here , we use hESCs to generate a 3D model of a human pre - gastrulation epiblast that can break AP symmetry under a uniform dose of BMP4 . BMP4 is one of the earliest morphogens necessary for the patterning of the mouse epiblast 4 , 18 and was shown to dif - ferentiate two - dimensional ( 2D ) micropatterned hESC colonies into organized germ layers defined relative to colony boundaries but without breaking axial symmetry 19 , 20 . Unlike in mESC / mEx - ESC aggregates 12 – 14 where the positioning of the mExESC creates a bias for initiation of primitive streak genes , we find that symme - try breaks spontaneously despite no apparent asymmetry in ligand application . Using a combination of genetic manipulations of the secreted inhibitors and live - cell imaging , we demonstrate the role of WNT and DKK1 in breaking symmetry in a model human epiblast . Results 3D human epiblast model . At 10 d of development , the human epiblast is a nearly spherical epithelial tissue lining the pro - amni - onic cavity 21 , 22 . Following previous literature where spherical epi - thelia were created by embedding mouse or human stem cells in Matrigel 17 , 22 , 23 , we dispersed dissociated hESCs as single cells in Matrigel and cultured them under pluripotency conditions . Although hESCs self - organized into spherical epithelial cysts , they failed to maintain pluripotency after 3 d of culture ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . In contrast , hESCs dispersed as single cells in defined poly - meric hydrogels 24 , 25 supplemented with Matrigel as a source of the basement membrane grew into spherical epithelia that displayed a similar size range , morphology and tissue polarity that matched the epiblast of our in vitro attached day 10 human embryos 21 ( Fig . 1a ) . Importantly , unlike Matrigel - only conditions , the cells now expressed NANOG , SOX2 and OCT4 after 4 d in culture ; hence , they were pluripotent ( Fig . 1b , c and Supplementary Fig . 1d ) .

Siggia 2 * Breaking the anterior – posterior symmetry in mammals occurs at gastrulation . Much of the signalling network underlying this process has been elucidated in the mouse ; however , there is no direct molecular evidence of events driving axis formation in humans . Here , we use human embryonic stem cells to generate an in vitro three - dimensional model of a human epiblast whose size , cell polarity and gene expression are similar to a day 10 human epiblast . A defined dose of BMP4 spontaneously breaks axial symmetry , and induces markers of the primitive streak and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition . We show that WNT sig - nalling and its inhibitor DKK1 play key roles in this process downstream of BMP4 . Our work demonstrates that a model human epiblast can break axial symmetry despite the absence of asymmetry in the initial signal and of extra - embryonic tissues or maternal cues . Our three - dimensional model is an assay for the molecular events underlying human axial symmetry breaking .

Furthermore , colonies showed apicobasal polarity , with the outer edge lined by COLLAGEN IV ( COLL IV ) — one of the key components of the basement membrane—and the inner side enriched with the actin - membrane linker EZRIN ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . The apically localized ZO - 1 showed pronounced expression at the cell – cell contacts on the interior of the model epiblast . The day 10 in vitro attached embryo epiblast was equally polarized , as seen by the actin enrichment lining the pro - amniotic cavity ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) 21 , 22 . To monitor the dynamics of epiblast self - organization and the expression of key transcription factors , we used our fluorescent reporter of germ layers ( RUES2 - GLR ) , in which the endogenous loci for the key transcription factors have been tagged using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) – CRISPR a Hydrogel mix Single - cell dissociation Plate and top with medium B r i gh t f i e l d Medium Gel > 2 d hESCs c 100 NANOGSOX2OCT4 80 60 40 20 0 0 50 100 0 0 R gyr ( µ m ) 10 20 30 40 50 10 , 000 7 , 500 5 , 000 2 , 500 0 0 100 ρ ( mm – 2 ) 200 100 60 1 . 00 0 . 75 0 . 50 I S O X 2 0 . 250 40 20 50 60 70 80 t ( h ) 50 60 70 80 t ( h ) 50 60 70 80 t ( h ) 50 0 N N DAPI DAPI ZO - 1 OCT4 NANOG COLL IV EZRIN Model human epiblast d Human embryo O C T 4 F - A C T I N / G A T A 6 D A P I 20 40 Percentage per colony P e r c en t age o f c o l on i e s P e r c en t age o f c o l on i e s Apical ECM Basolateral DAPI NANOG OCT4 GATA6 DAPI NANOG OCT4 SOX2 Day 10 in vitro attached human embryo Model human epiblast b e m C e r – B R A m C i t – S O X 2 2 days 2 . 5 days 3 days 3 . 5 days R g y r ( µ m ) Model human epiblast Day 10 human epiblast Fig . 1 | In vitro 3D model of a pre - gastrulation human epiblast . a , Dissociated hESCs are dispersed into a mix of liquid hydrogel / Matrigel ( 5 : 1 ( v : v ) ) and incubated for at least 2 d to form spherical epithelia ( model human epiblast ) .

RUES2 - GLR expresses mCitrine – SOX2 ( mCit – SOX2 ; active in pluripotency and anterior epiblast ) , mCerulean – BRA ( mCer – BRA ; expressed at gastrulation in the primitive streak and mesoderm ) and tdTomato – SOX17 ( tdTom – SOX17 ; expressed at gastrulation within the endoderm and other tissues ; Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . The expression of markers in vari - ous regions of a gastrulating epiblast is based on a wealth of data from mice but , importantly , also from monkey and human embr yos 21 , 22 , 27 , 28 . Starting at 48 h after seeding , live - cell imaging of RUES2 - GLR model epiblasts under pluripotency conditions showed a continuous proliferation over the course of at least 36 h ( Fig . 1e , Supplementary Fig . 1g , h and Supplementary Video 1 ) , with 85 % colonies remaining SOX2 + BRA − by the end of 3 . 5 d ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Figs . 1g , h , 2a , b ) . In summary , based on morpholog - ical features , and transcription - factor and surface - protein expres - sion profiles , we use our spherical hESC epithelia grown in hydrogel as a minimal 3D experimental model of a pre - gastrulation human epiblast and henceforth refer to it as a model human epiblast . Concentration - dependent patterning by BMP4 . To test whether the epiblast alone can break the AP symmetry in the absence of extra - embryonic tissues and asymmetric ligand presentation , we cultured hESCs in 3D for 2 or 3 d , to obtain a range of sizes , and then applied BMP4 uniformly to the medium for 2 d ( Fig . 2a ) . As the effective con - centration of secreted BMP4 in a mammalian embryo is unknown , we tested concentrations from 0 . 1 to 10 ng ml − 1 . We checked the epithelial 3D colonies for the expression of known markers of early gastrulation by imaging the end - point immunofluorescence ( IF ) stains and by live - cell imaging of the RUES2 - GLR line . Based on the expression of SOX2 and BRA , we found three distinct popula - tions of colonies : ( 1 ) colonies that were entirely SOX2 + , ( 2 ) colo - nies with SOX2 + and BRA + cells , and ( 3 ) colonies with no SOX2 . The population fraction depended on the BMP4 concentration ( Fig . 2b ) . At low BMP4 concentrations ( 0 . 1 ng ml − 1 ) , the majority of colonies remained SOX2 + ( Fig . 2b ) . This population probably remains undifferentiated , as the SOX2 levels remained constant over time ( t ) in live - cell imaging ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c and Supplementary Video 2 ) and the end - point SOX2 + colonies were also OCT4 + ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . At high BMP4 concentra - tions ( 5 or 10 ng ml − 1 ) , SOX2 levels declined uniformly and rapidly with no obvious signs of asymmetry ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , e and Supplementary Video 3 ) . The majority of the colonies expressed GATA6 and GATA3 , with a subset also expressing BRA , and the cells in the colonies were no longer columnar as in the epiblast ( Supplementary Fig . 2f ) . This molecular and morphological sig - nature resembles BMP4 - induced trophectoderm cells reported in the literature and we did not pursue their identity further 29 . Finally , intermediate BMP4 concentrations ( 1 ng ml − 1 ) resulted in a mix of all three colony types , with approximately 50 % of the colonies yield - ing both SOX2 + and BRA + cells ( Fig . 2b ) , providing a 3D platform to study the axial patterning of the human epiblast model . Breaking AP symmetry by intermediate BMP4 concentrations . In the colonies containing SOX2 + and BRA + cells , induced by 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 , the expression of the two cell types was spatially separated and the expression of SOX2 / BRA was mutually exclu - sive ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Spontaneous symmetry breaking was confirmed in seven independent experiments probing BRA / SOX2 expression as well as molecular markers of epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) together with live - cell imaging . The influence of the par - ticular synthetic hydrogel was ruled out by testing two chemically distinct hydrogels ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . We next partitioned the cells into expressing or non - expressing , based on the intensity of SOX2 or BRA IF ( see Supplementary Fig . 3b for an example of a segmented epiblast ) . Approximately 60 % of the cells in each model epiblast were BRA + or SOX2 + , with roughly equal fractions of either marker ( Fig . 3c ) , and the distribu - tion of colonies by composition peaked around an equal mixture ( Fig . 3d ) . There was no appreciable correlation between the size of the BRA domain per colony and its radius ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . The cells marked as non - expressing were probably transitioning from SOX2 to BRA , which is why they did not pass the unbiased IF - intensity Otsu threshold . We ruled out the possibility of these cells being of extra - embryonic origin as there was no appreciable GATA3 expression in BRA + / SOX2 + colonies ; all cells seemed to be morphologically columnar and all cells had comparable OCT4 expression levels ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . Notably , RNA sequencing of cells from macaque embryos around gastrulation and IF staining of pre - gastrulating human embryos shows that extra - embryonic lineages do not express OCT4 and trophectoderm cells always express GATA3 21 , 27 . We observed symmetry breaking in model epiblasts across the entire tested size range , namely in the radius of gyration ( R gyr ) range of 15 – 80 μ m ( Fig . 3e , f ) . However , unlike real gastrulating embryos , we did not observe a sharp boundary between the BRA and SOX2 regions and the BRA domain seemed to be more spread in some colonies than in others ( compare examples in Fig . 3a – f ) . Given this variability , but also because the 3D colonies are randomly oriented in the gel and the spatial separation of markers is therefore not always easily seen in confocal sections , we devised two symmetry - breaking metrics . The first , AP dipole ( μ → ) , is a vector measuring the spatial segregation between the BRA and the SOX2 domains , weighted by single - cell IF intensities , and its magnitude μ increases with the degree of symmetry breaking ( Fig . 3g ) . As an analogy , this vector best distinguishes the distribution of two colours painting a sphere . Its value is zero if the colours are uniformly mixed and it is at its maximum if the colours are segregated into separate hemi - spheres .

The sample size under each pie chart represents the number of imaged 3D colonies from the combined end - point IF staining and live - cell imaging using the RUES2 - GLR cell line ( see Supplementary Fig . 3a for the breakdown ) . The statistics were deduced from seven ( four IF stained , three imaged live ) , two ( one IF stained , one imaged live ) and three ( one IF stained , two imaged live ) independent experiments for 1 , 5 and 0 . 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 , respectively . The composition of the majority populations at 0 . 1 and 5 – 10 ng ml − 1 BMP4 is discussed in Supplementary Fig . 2 . The populations at 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 are discussed in the subsequent sections . NAtuRE CEll BIoloGY | VOL 21 | JULY 2019 | 900 – 910 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 902 Technical RepoRT Nature Cell Biology we show that the measured μ → values are very far from random , therefore quantitatively confirming symmetry breaking in pat - terned 3D colonies , largely independent of colony size ( Fig . 3f , g and Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . The second symmetry breaking parameter , cell mixing ( σ ) , quantifies the compactness of the two domains . It is calculated by counting the number of nearest neighbour cell pairs expressing the same marker . Low σ values ( approximately < 30 % ; dark grey region in Fig . 3h ) are characteristic of an unmixed and a compact domain , intermediate values ( ~ 30 – 75 % ; grey region ) are characteristic of an unmixed but more elongated pattern , whereas high values ( approxi - mately > 75 % ; light grey region ) are characteristic of perfect mix - ing—that is , a salt - and - pepper pattern . Measuring σ across the entire BRA + / SOX2 + population , independently of μ → , confirmed that the patterned model epiblasts had relatively unmixed BRA and SOX2 domains , irrespective of the colony radius ( Fig . 3h ) . Interestingly , however , the mean σ of 20 % for SOX2 compared with 40 % for BRA indicates that the SOX2 domain is more compact , whereas the BRA domain , although still unmixed , displays a more elongated pat - tern—that is , more perimeter per area ( Fig . 3h ) . To ensure that the AP symmetry breaking is reproducible in a different hESC line , we repeated the experiment in the RUES1 cell line , where incubation with 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 for 2 d produced a frac - tion of BRA + / SOX2 + colonies similar to RUES2 , with a dipole moment indicative of polarized colonies ( Supplementary Fig . 3g ) . Signatures of the primitive streak and EMT . To show that the symmetry - broken population is undergoing EMT and exhibiting molecular signatures consistent with the primitive streak , we exam - ined the canonical marker SNAIL 30 ( Fig . 4a – c ) . Immunofluorescent SNAIL expression was observed with varying degrees of inten - sity and it was often asymmetrically expressed ( Fig . 4a , c and Supplementary Fig . 4a – c ) . Colonies expressing SNAIL and SOX2 showed symmetry breaking , marked by a shift in the SNAIL / SOX2 μ from the control and , independently , by low values of σ ( Fig . 4b ) . In the SOX2 + region , NANOG expression was weak or absent , suggesting these cells are undergoing differentiation and are thus no longer pluripotent epiblast hESCs ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . The tight junction protein ZO - 1 was still expressed at the api - cal side in cells that were part of the epithelium in the SNAIL + domains ( Fig . 4c ) . Moreover , the expression of cadherins showed a typical molecular signature of EMT , with a downregulation of E - CADHERIN ( E - CAD ) 31 and an upregulation of N - CADHERIN ( N - CAD ) in the BRA - rich region of prominently symmetry - broken colonies ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Among the symmetry - broken colonies , there was often a reduction of the basement membrane in the BRA + or SNAIL + domain , ranging from weaker COLL IV expression ( Fig . 4e , top and Supplementary Fig . 4c , left ) to a complete disintegration of the collagen network ( Fig . 4e , centre and bottom , and Supplementary Fig . 4c , right ) . COLL IV breakdown co - localized with N - CAD and SNAIL expression , reinforcing the molecular signatures of EMT 32 ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Collagen breakdown in the primitive streak is a prominent sign of gastrulation and seemed to be qualitatively similar in the gastrulating mouse embryo 33 . The asymmetric expression of BRA , SNAIL and N - CAD together with the breakdown of the basement membrane indicates that our 3D model system mirrors the initial step of AP axis specification . Dynamics of symmetry breaking . To observe the dynamics of symmetry breaking , we imaged live model epiblasts composed of the RUES2 - GLR cell line . Our aim was to understand whether BRA asymmetry was a consequence of initial stochastic activation fol - lowed by sorting or whether BRA activation was asymmetric in a colony . At 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 , half the colonies expressed BRA and SOX2 , comparably to IF measurements ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . The SOX2 levels were unchanged in a fraction of the population , suggesting they remained pluripotent , consistent with the IF mea - surements ( Supplementary Fig . 2c and Supplementary Video 2 ) , and there was no dipole moment in populations that were either only SOX2 + or rapidly lost SOX2 expression ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . Notably , the signal - to - noise ratio is much lower in live - cell imaging than in IF due to gel embedding , low endogenous protein expression and lowered imaging power to prevent phototoxicity . Nevertheless , time - lapse showed that in the BRA + / SOX2 + popu - lation SOX2 expression declined and BRA expression began on one side of the colony and then expanded ( Fig . 5a , Supplementary Figs . 5c , 6a and Supplementary Videos 4 – 6 ) . Consistent with this observation , the quantifications showed that , concurrent with the BRA activation at 20 – 25 h post BMP4 induction , the AP dipole rises sharply ( Fig . 5b ) . Live - cell imaging therefore demonstrates that BRA / SOX2 patterning is a result of signalling asymmetry and not of cell sorting . After establishing the BRA – SOX2 axis , we observed EMT , mani - fested as BRA + cells escaping the colony ( Supplementary Fig . 5a and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Some of the BRA + cells also even - tually expressed SOX17 , a marker of endoderm and other epiblast derivatives during gastrulation ( Fig . 5 , Supplementary Fig . 6 and Supplementary Video 6 ) . We confirmed the expression of SOX17 , readily detectable in colonies clearly undergoing EMT , with IF staining ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) .

However , the lack of extra - embryonic tissues also allows cells to escape into the gel matrix after EMT and the BRA – SOX2 separation is not sustained . At this point the experiment ends naturally because of this transient nature of symmetry breaking in our minimal epiblast - only model . Molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking . In light of our recent finding that the BMP4 receptors are localized at the basolat - eral side of hESCs , we expected all cells to have equal initial access to BMP4 given the polarity of our colonies ( Fig . 1d ) 34 . To confirm this hypothesis , we monitored the dynamics of SMAD1 transloca - tion into the nucleus by live imaging model epiblasts composed of the RUES2 cell line with SMAD1 tagged at the endogenous locus 35 . a DAPI OCT4 M a x i m u m i n t en s i t y p r o j e c t i on z - s li c e A n t e r i o r P o s t e r i o r b c d 100 50 BRA + SOX2 + 40 30 20 P e r c en t age o f c o l on i e s 10 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 Percentage per colony 80 60 40 20 0 B R A + S O X 2 + B R A + / S O X 2 + B R A / S O X 2 – P e r c en t age pe r c o l on y 6 6 4 4 I BRA f h Unmixed Mixed σ = 0 σ = 1 σ σ DAPI 19 µ m 32 µ m 48 µ m 58 µ m OCT4 BRA SOX2 Maximum intensity projection g 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 25 Mean R gyr ( µ m ) M ean µ / R 3g y r ( µ m – 2 ) µ / R 3gyr ( µ m – 2 ) R gyr ( µ m ) 50 ExpCtrl ExpCtrl I S O X 2 2 2 0 0 e 20 15 10 5 0 20 40 60 R gyr ( µ m ) 80 N c o l on i e s AP axis dipole ( µ ) → 50 40 30 20 P e r c en t age o f c o l on i e s P e r c en t age o f c o l on i e s 10 0 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 BRA + SOX2 + BRA SOX2 0 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 40 60 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 BRA SOX2 BRA SOX2 NAtuRE CEll BIoloGY | VOL 21 | JULY 2019 | 900 – 910 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 904 Technical RepoRT Nature Cell Biology a DAPI SNAIL SNAIL SOX2 NANOG ZO - 1 DAPI BRA BRA E - CAD COLL IV N - CAD N - CAD BRA E - CAD N - CAD BRA COLL IV N - CAD DAPI COLL IV DAPI COLL IV DAPI DAPI BRA SNAIL COLL IV COLL IV N - CAD N - CAD DAPI DAPI SNAIL SOX2 b d e 50 Exp 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 030 35 40 SNAIL SOX2 Ctrl 0 40 30 20 10 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 C o l on i e s ( % ) σ c Mean R gyr ( µ m ) µ / R 3gyr ( µ m – 2 ) Fig . 4 | Signs of the primitive streak and EMt . a , Pattern of SNAIL expression ( 11 individual SNAIL + / SOX2 + BMP4 - patterned 3D colonies , of which 9 were also co - stained for NANOG ) . b , Symmetry - breaking analysis on SNAIL + / SOX2 + patterned epiblast models ( n = 11 individual 3D colonies ) .

Quantification of colonies stimulated with 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 showed that the nuclear SMAD1 signal increased after BMP4 stimulation . At about 14 h , when the nuclear SMAD1 signal is high and before the expected BRA activation , there was no polarity in the SMAD1 expression within a colony ( Fig . 6b , c ) . Therefore , the initial BMP4 signal is uniform and the symmetry breaks downstream . At 48 h post BMP4 induction , the IF intensity levels of phospho - SMAD1 ( pSMAD1 ) were variable with no bias in the BRA - rich region of symmetry - broken colonies ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . We have recently elucidated the BMP4 – WNT – NODAL sig - nalling cascade in 2D micropatterned hESCs , which relied on the BMP4 inhibitor NOGGIN to induce radially organized germ lay - ers 34 . Furthermore , we found that WNT is a direct target of BMP4 and that it does not depend on secondary WNT secretion , and we identified a variety of secreted WNT inhibitors produced following WNT3A stimulation of 2D micropatterned colonies 26 , 36 . We thus sought to identify the key components involved in AP induction in our model epiblasts . To obtain an adequate yield and a purer population of cells for gene expression analysis , we grew hESCs on transwell filters , instead of using 3D colonies , as they promote the formation of a large , contiguous and uniform epiblast - like epi - thelium 34 . Transwell filters also allow uniform basal application of BMP4 to all cells in a manner that is equivalent to the 3D system . After titrating the BMP4 levels , we found that a dose of 10 ng ml − 1 BMP4 applied to the bottom compartment of the transwell filter a Confocal slice Maximum intensity projection 10 h 12 h 14 h 16 h 18 h 20 h 22 h 26 h 24 h 22 h 24 h 26 h 28 h 30 h 32 h 28 h 30 h 32 h 34 h 36 h b c 1 BRA mCit – SOX2 mCit – SOX2 mCer – BRA mCer – BRA tdTom – SOX17 SOX2 10 20 30 t ( h ) 40 10 0 50 150 200 100 20 30 40 t ( h ) N + / N + m a x 10 – 3 µ ( µ m ) µ ( BRA ) µ ( SOX2 ) µ ( BRA ) – µ ( SOX2 ) 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 Fig . 5 | Dynamics of AP symmetry breaking , EMt and SoX17 activation . a , Live - cell imaging of a RUES2 - GLR model epiblast after the addition of 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 .

A lower dose ( 1 ng ml − 1 ) yielded sparser BRA + domains ( Supplementary Fig . 7f , g ) . Note that the effective BMP4 concentration is not directly comparable between the filter - and 3D - grown epithelia , as pores only comprise about 10 % of the filter surface . We sorted the patterned 2D tissue into high - and low - SOX2 - expressing cells using fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) and then performed quantitative PCR with reverse transcription ( RT – qPCR ) on the two pools ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . The SOX2 - low region expressed BRA , WNT3A and NODAL at high levels ( Fig . 7b and Supplementary Fig . 7c ) , which is consistent with the primitive streak genes expressed in the mouse 4 . There was no appre - ciable difference in the expression of the NODAL inhibitors LEFTY1 and CERBERUS1 or the BMP inhibitor NOGGIN ( Fig . 7b , c ) ; how - ever , DKK1 was expressed at high levels in the BRA + / SOX2 − region at 24 h ( Fig . 7b , c ) . Therefore , both the activator ( WNT ) and its inhibitor ( DKK1 ) are expressed in the same tissue ( see Discussion ) . To confirm that the WNT – DKK1 pair is key in symmetry break - ing of model epiblasts , we used the RUES2 - GLR cell line in which DKK1 was knocked out 36 and conducted live - cell imaging on 3D epiblast models after adding 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 . We found that— in stark contrast to the wild type ( WT ) model epiblasts , which expressed the two markers asymmetrically—RUES2 - GLR DKK1 knockout ( KO ) rapidly and uniformly lost SOX2 expression , and then uniformly activated BRA + in > 80 % of the colonies ( Fig . 7d , e and Supplementary Video 8 ) . Shortly after BRA takes over the colony , most cells undergo EMT and the colonies disintegrate ( Supplementary Video 8 ) . Furthermore , stimulated RUES2 - GLR DKK1 KO 3D colonies displayed a precocious SOX2 loss / BRA activation , with BRA appearing on average approximately 20 h earlier than in the WT colonies ( Fig . 7f , g ) . As a control , we con - firmed that , in pluripotency media and under the same imaging conditions , the majority of RUES2 - GLR DKK1 KO model epiblasts remained SOX2 + ( Supplementary Fig . 7d ) . Finally , the absence of symmetry breaking is also quantitatively demonstrated by a low dipole that remains nearly constant throughout imaging ( Fig . 7h ) . The inhibition of WNT secretion with IWP2 ( 2 µ M ) or IWR1 ( at 2 µ M ) —which stabilizes Axin , thus inhibiting the canonical WNT pathway—along with 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 aborted the activation of BRA , thus confirming that symmetry breaking is WNT - dependent ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) . As hESCs grown on filters provide an opportunity to indepen - dently confirm key effectors in the symmetry - breaking mechanism , we stimulated RUES2 DKK1 KO epithelia with 10 ng ml − 1 BMP4 from below . We did not observe patches of BRA expression ; thus , symmetry breaking was abolished ( Supplementary Fig . 7f ) . We next checked for the initial WNT response in the WT and found that after a short time ( 4 h ) only WNT3 is expressed , consistent with our recent RNA sequencing of micropatterned hESCs stimu - lated with BMP4 ( ref . 26 ) ; however , all of the tested WNT proteins were expressed at 24 h ( Supplementary Fig . 7h ) . At this time point , another early mesoderm marker ( MIXL1 ) was detected in addition to BRA , whereas SOX17 was not yet expressed , which is consistent with the live imaging of 3D epiblast models . To test the effect of other inhibitors of the BMP4 – WNT – NODAL signalling cascade , we generated model epiblasts from RUES2 NOGGIN KO and RUES2 LEFTY1 CERBERUS1 double KO cell lines 34 , 36 .

Model epiblasts comprising the double LEFTY1 CERBERUS1 KO as well as the WT model epiblast treated with the NODAL inhibitor SB - 431542 resulted in BRA – SOX2 sym - metry breaking following 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 stimulation at a similar frequency as the WT conditions , suggesting that NODAL is not necessary in the initial axial patterning ( Supplementary Fig . 7j ) . Discussion In recent years , considerable progress in mammalian development has been made by recapitulating aspects of early embryogenesis in vitro 37 . In the mouse , the initiation and positioning of the primi - tive streak is thought to be under the direct control of WNT from the posterior visceral endoderm and the inhibitors of WNT and NODAL secreted from the AVE 4 , 38 – 40 . However , the self - organizing capacity of the epiblast itself remains an open question . Our work establishes the minimal cellular and molecular components for observing AP symmetry breaking in a human epiblast model . Surprisingly , our model shows that , in the absence of any extra - embryonic tissues or maternal cues , the human epiblast model alone can spontane - ously establish an AP axis and undergo local EMT when subject to a low uniform dose of BMP4 . Embryonic stem cells absorb BMP4 and other TGF β proteins only basally ; thus , retaining the epithelial 87 % 13 % BRA + / SOX2 + BRA + / SOX2− e a FACS SOX2L SOX2 mCer – BRA BRA mCit – SOX2 SOX2H RT – qPCR d c b h S O X 2 N A N O G B R A W N T 3 A N O D A L – 2 0 2 4 l og 2 [ q S O X 2L / q S O X 2 H ] l og 2 [ q S O X 2L / q S O X 2 H ] L E FT Y 1 C E R N O G G I N D K K 1 – 2 0 2 4 10 20 30 40 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 N + / N + m a x t ( h ) f g W T D K K 1 K O t B R A + on s e t ( h ) 10 20 30 40 0 50 100 150 t ( h ) WT DKK1 KO 41 h 25 h 21 h 5 h 41 h 25 h 21 h 5 h 0 10 20 30 40 50 µ ( × 10 – 3 µ m ) DKK1KOWT BRASOX2 n = 25 n = 15 BMP4 Fig . 7 | Molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking in the 3D model of the epiblast . a , Stimulating RUES2 - GLR 2D model epiblasts grown on transwell filters with 10 ng ml − 1 BMP4 from the basal side for 24 h yielded regionalized BRA + ( green ) and SOX2 + ( purple ) patterns .

NAtuRE CEll BIoloGY | VOL 21 | JULY 2019 | 900 – 910 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 908 Technical RepoRT Nature Cell Biology polarity of the epiblast is crucial 34 . Interestingly , mESC models that begin by stimulation of the WNT pathway of non - polarized mESC clusters using small - molecule agonists whose activity is indepen - dent of tissue polarity also break symmetry and even give rise to a high variety of downstream cell types despite lacking the mor - phological features of the real embryo 9 – 11 . This relationship between signalling and morphology will be of great interest to the field in the near future . Promising efforts in modelling the asymmetric epi - blast – amnion using human stem cells have also been made and it will be interesting to integrate the epiblast – amnion transition with the AP - axis formation 16 . Minimal models such as ours allow peeling back of the layers of regulation that make embryogenesis such a robust process and serve as the substrate for adding back the extra - embryonic tissues . Although our work suggests WNT probably establishes a concen - tration gradient to break symmetry , it will be interesting to observe and measure the dynamics of WNT signalling activity in the future . What comes as a surprise is that both the activator and the inhibi - tor come from the posterior epiblast , unlike the prevailing pic - ture in the mouse where DKK1 is typically seen coming from the AVE . However , recent high - resolution RNA sequencing of the E7 mouse epiblast 41 , as well as earlier work in rabbits 42 , showed that DKK1 is also elevated in the primitive streak and not just in the AVE . The earliest evidence for DKK1 secretion in primates comes from macaque embryo experiments where DKK1 was detected in the AVE before gastrulation . There is no data on DKK1 localiza - tion at gastrulation in primates 28 . The spatial overlap of morphogen activity with its inhibitor conforms to patterning mechanisms based on reaction - diffusion or Turing models , but the precise physical attributes of a Turing instability remains to be elucidated 43 . Finally , we have recently shown that DKK1 controls the extent and dura - tion of the wave of primitive streak extension in WNT - stimulated 2D micropatterned hESC colonies , therefore further supporting the findings here 36 . Our assay provides a foundation for future exploration of the influence of the mechanical environment and extra - embryonic tissues in the early patterning , a key step in resolving the inter - relation of morphogenesis and fate acquisition in human embryogenesis . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research reporting summaries , source data , statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 019 - 0349 - 7 .

The work reported in this paper was supported by two NIH grants and both underwent review by and received approval from the Tri - Institutional Stem Cell Initiative Embryonic Stem Cell Oversight Committee ( Tri - SCI ESCRO ) , which is the human Embryo Research Oversight ( EMRO ) that serves The Rockefeller University , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medicine . They are : ( 1 ) ESCRO 2014 - 06 - 005 ; grant HD080699 ‘Dissecting embryonic axis formation using micropatterned hESC colony architecture’ whose primary goal is “to establish micropatterned cell culture as a system for studying signalling dynamics and spatial patterning in hESCs” and ( 2 ) ESCRO 2012 - 07 - 001 ; GM101653 ‘Dynamical readout of TGF β signalling and modelling of cell - fate determination in human embryonic stem cells’ , whose primary aim is “to understand the relationship between signalling dynamics and cell - fate choice for the TGF - beta signalling pathway which is crucial for the establishment of many fates during embryogenesis” . Tri - SCI ESCRO review is informed by the NAS and ISSCR Guidelines . The protocol submission to the Tri - SCI ESCRO includes a Notification Form that solicits information about the aims and methods as well as a copy of the sections of the funded grant application that describe the research aims and methods . In addition , the ESCRO requires and reviews annual reports from principal investigators describing the research activities conducted during the previous year . Through this combination , the ESCRO reviews the research both prospectively and on an ongoing basis . Cell culture . RUES2 ( NIHhESC - 09 - 0013 ) and RUES1 ( NIHhESC - 09 - 0012 ) hESC lines were used and cultured in HUESM medium ( DMEM supplemented with 20 % knockout serum replacement , 1 × B27 supplement without vitamin A , 0 . 1 mM non - essential amino acids , 2 mM GlutaMax and 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) conditioned by mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF - CM ) and supplemented with 20 ng ml − 1 basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . The cells were grown at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 on tissue culture dishes that were coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) at a 40 × ( v / v ) dilution . The cells were passaged approximately every 5 d as small colonies or as single cells . The medium was changed daily . The cells were checked regularly for mycoplasma infections and were used for no more than approximately 20 passages . CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genetically modified cell lines . All genetic modifications were conducted in the RUES2 background . All cell lines and reporters were previously created and validated for pluripotency and genetic integrity . The RUES2 - GLR line ( the germ layer reporter ) was created and validated in ref . 26 . RUES2 - GLR DKK1 KO , and RUES2 LEFTY1 and CERBERUS1 KO cells were created and validated in ref . 36 . RUES2 NOGGIN KO was created and validated in ref . 34 . The RUES2 SMAD1 reporter was created and validated in ref . 35 . 3D model of a human epiblast . The experiment was performed in a 35 - mm plastic imaging dish ( Ibidi ) . Cells were dissociated as single cells using Accutase ( Stem Cell Technologies ) , spun at 300 g for 3 min and resuspended in MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF at 1 – 2 × 10 6 cells ml − 1 . The cell suspension ( ~ 30 μ l ) was mixed with 30 μ l Matrigel and 150 μ l hydrogel on ice in that order ( see below for the hydrogel chemistry ) , and mixed a few times with the pipette tip to disperse the cells as single cells in the gel . The gels were kept on ice the entire time and handled rapidly to prevent premature solidification . The components were thoroughly mixed , taking care not to introduce bubbles , and then transferred to the bottom of the dish in a snake - like pattern to fully cover the inner circle of the imaging dish . The gel - embedded cell mix was placed in an incubator for 5 – 10 min to solidify and then topped with warm MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF + pen / strep supplemented with 10 μ M Y27632 ( RI ) for ~ 24 h ( Fig . 2a ) . The medium change was done by spinning down the suspension at 150 g for 1 min in case the gel mix did not adhere to the surface . We tested two chemically distinct hydrogels , which were PEG - based 24 ( Mebiol , Cosmobio ) and Fmoc - based 25 ( Biogelx ) . Mebiol was prepared by diluting the lyophilized gel with 10 ml PBS + / + ( Sigma ) overnight . Biogelx was prepared in aliquots by diluting 21 . 5 μ g of the powder with 5 ml water and then vigorously vortexing for several minutes . Both liquefied hydrogels were kept at 4 °C . The quality of the hydrogels and the Matrigel deteriorated in the fridge , as seen by reduced cell survival when using the gel refrigerated for a long time . Mebiol and Biogelx were used within 2 – 4 weeks after the initial dilution . Biogelx required vigorous vortexing or sonication before each experiment . Matrigel was initially thawed overnight in the fridge , and then aliquoted and kept in the freezer . Each aliquot was then only re - thawed once and used within two weeks . Patterning of the human epiblast model . To start the experiment , the medium was changed ( MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF + pen / strep ) and supplemented with the desired concentration of BMP4 and / or the other molecule being tested . The dish was left unperturbed for 48 h in the incubator or mounted into the incubation chamber on the microscope for live - cell imaging . A step - by - step protocol has also been included at Protocol Exchange 44 . IF staining and imaging of model human epiblasts . The experimental medium was collected , spun down at 150 g for 1 min , resuspended in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( dissolved in PBS + / + ) and then poured back into the experimental dish to fix the synthetic epiblasts for 30 – 60 min . After washing twice with PBS + / + , the sample was permeabilized with 2 % bovine serum albumin in 0 . 1 % Triton - X ( Sigma ) dissolved in PBS + / + ( block solution ) for at least 30 min at 4 °C . This step also liquefies the gel and frees the synthetic epiblasts into the solution . The block solution was replaced with primary antibodies dissolved in block solution overnight . The primary antibodies were washed off with three washes ( 15 – 30 min per wash ) with 0 . 1 % Triton - X solution in PBS + / + . The secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted in block solution were then added for 30 min . Finally , the model epiblasts were washed twice with 0 . 1 % Triton - X in PBS + / + and kept in that medium at 4 °C . The list of primary and secondary antibodies , antibody dilutions and antibody catalogue numbers can be found in Supplementary Table 1 . Imaging of fixed samples was performed on a Zeiss Inverted LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope with a × 10 , × 20 or × 40 dry objective . Live - cell imaging was performed with a Yokagawa / Olympus Cell Voyager spinning disk microscope with a dedicated cell incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) using a × 20 dry objective . Images of the RUES2 - GLR and RUES2 - GLR KO cell lines were acquired at a frequency of 1 h − 1 for no longer than 40 h at laser powers and exposure times that we optimized for minimum cell death , whereas the images of 3D colonies composed of the SMAD1 live reporter were acquired at a frequency of 2 – 3 h − 1 for no longer than 24 h . Patterning and imaging hESC on filters . Transwell polycarbonate membrane ( Costar ) inserts , 12 mm in diameter , were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with 250 μ l of 10 mg ml − 1 laminin 521 ( Biolamina ) diluted in PBS + / + . The membrane was rinsed with PBS + / + . The cells were dissociated as single cells with Accutase and then resuspended in MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF + pen / strep + 10 μ M RI . The same medium containing 100 , 000 cells in 500 μ l was carefully added on top of the membrane and about 1 . 5 ml of the same medium ( without cells ) was added to the bottom of each filter insert . The RI was washed out the following day ( from both filter compartments ) . MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF + pen / strep + 10 ng ml − 1 BMP4 was added to the bottom of the well 48 h after seeding . The filters were fixed 24 h later , stained as described above and then imaged with a × 20 objective . FACS sorting and RT – qPCR of patterned hESC filters . RUES2 - GLR cells ( 100 , 000 ) were seeded on 6 . 5 - mm polyester filters in MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF + pen / strep + 10 μ M RI ( n = 15 filters ) . The medium was replaced with MEF - CM + 20 ng ml − 1 bFGF + pen / strep 2 h after seeding . The next day , a confluent layer of pluripotent hESC formed and 10 ng ml − 1 BMP4 was added to the basal side of ten filters and five filters were left in pluripotency medium as controls . After 24 h , the cultures were dissociated as single cells with Accutase and the samples associated with differentiation or control conditions were pooled . We defined SOX2 - high and SOX2 - low cells based on the mCit – SOX2 expression in FACS ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Live - dead gating was determined based on the forward scatter . On average , 70 % of the cells were gated as live . To determine the SOX2 - high and SOX2 - low populations , gating of the SOX2 - high population was determined in the undifferentiated sample . This led to 67 % of cells in the SOX2 - high gate and 25 . 5 % of the cells in the SOX2 - low gate in the differentiated sample . Differential gene expression in these three populations was analysed by RT – qPCR using standard protocols . Analysis of IF - stained colonies . It should be noted that the brightness of the fluorescence images was adjusted to be visually representable in figures and was always done equally and linearly across the entire image . Confocal images of individual epiblast models were segmented based on DAPI staining . First , the background of individual images in all channels was subtracted using the rolling - ball background subtraction algorithm in Fiji . Seeds for single - cell segmentation were generated by Ilastik and used by an in - house watershed - based algorithm to generate the segmented images . The fluorescence intensities of individual cells were taken as the median intensity divided by the median DAPI intensity of that cell . A visual inspection of the colonies rendered in 3D revealed some distortion in the z - axis , probably a result of adhesion , centrifugation and , partly , light aberration , inherent to the dimensionality of our structures and the gel remnants after staining . No corrections were made , as it did not appreciably affect the normalized symmetry - breaking metrics . The R gyr was calculated as : ∑ = →−→ = R N r r 1 ( ) i N i gyr 1 2 where N is the total number of cells , → r i is the position of the centroid of cell i and → r is the mean position of all centroids . Cell surface density , ρ , was defined as : ρ π = ∕ N R ( 4 ) gyr2 NAtuRE CEll BIoloGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Technical RepoRT Nature Cell Biology Borrowing from chemistry , the AP dipole was calculated equivalently to the electric dipole of a molecule , where a segmented cell was equivalent to an atom and its median IF intensity to an effective charge . First , the fluorescence intensities for each colony were rescaled to the maximum per - cell median intensity in each channel . This step was done to ensure equal scaling across the population , as the intensities from IF stains generally cannot be compared between experiments and they are also affected by the height of the imaged colony in the chamber . The dipoles for BRA and SOX2 were then separately calculated as : ∑ μ → = →−→ = = I I r r ( ) ; A BRA or SOX2 i N i A 1 A A , max The total dipole , μ → , and its magnitude , μ , are then calculated as : μ μ μ → = → −→ BRA SOX2 μ μ = ∣→ ∣ 2 and normalized by the volume dimensions , μ ∕ R gyr3 , to remove the expected dependence on colony size in the population . In theory , any non - zero value indicates symmetry breaking ; however , noise can give rise to a small μ . To ensure the measured μ quantitatively demonstrates symmetry breaking we permutated the measured SOX2 and BRA intensities among segmented cells for each patterned 3D colony and calculated the mean μ from 1 , 000 permutations . The σ parameter was inspired by the edge energy of immiscible liquids—the smaller the boundary between the two liquids , the lower the mixing . In this case , σ is a fraction of non - like neighbours of a cell , averaged for all cells of a colony . To extract the network of neighbours , the centroids of the segmented image were first surface meshed with a 3D Voronoi tessellation , which produced a list of ‘edges’ , that is , cell – cell contacts . Next , each cell was determined to be BRA + and / or SOX2 + by Otsu thresholding of individual colonies separately in each channel ( in Fig . 4 , the Otsu threshold for SNAIL was adjusted by a factor of 0 . 9 , judged by visual inspection ) . Non - normalized cell mixing , σ * A , was calculated as : σ = = − E E * ; A BRA or SOX2 A A nonA tot where E A – nonA is the number of non - like edges ( for example , in the case of BRA , those connecting a BRA + and a BRA − cell ) and E tot is the total number of edges . The more the cells are mixed , the higher σ will be ; however , the actual maximum and minimum depend on the number of BRA + versus SOX2 + cells . Therefore , the idealized minimum and maximum were calculated by permutating BRA + and SOX2 + among the segmented cells for each colony . The normalized σ , which by definition runs from zero to one , as reported in the Main text is then calculated as : σ σ σ σ σ = − − = * * * * ; A BRA or SOX2 A A A , min A , max A , min where σ * A , min and σ * A , max are the minimum and maximum values among 10 , 000 permutations , respectively . Analysis of live - cell imaging . The plots reported in Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 1g , h were segmented based on SOX2 expression . However , under induction conditions , the analysis was done on voxel intensities instead of doing per - cell segmentation due to the low endogenous expression of BRA and therefore weak fluorescence signal . The image was binarized into BRA - and SOX2 - expressing voxels by Otsu thresholding . Given that the epiblast models were live imaged while still embedded in the gel at various distances from the surface and an overall lower signal - to - noise ratio compared with IF , the thresholding had to be adjusted for each colony due to the different absolute signal intensities among colonies . The mean intensity was rescaled so that the first snapshot equals one for SOX2 and zero for BRA for all except the plot in Supplementary Fig . 2b ( right ) where the first snapshot in SOX2 was set to one and the minimum to zero for clarity . The AP dipole was calculated as described above accounting only for BRA + , that is , SOX2 + voxels and they were not intensity - weighted . The measurement for each colony was performed up to EMT , as escaping cells compromise the µ . Videos with a very low signal - to - noise ratio and , in a few cases , where non - related cells appeared in the proximity were discarded due to uncertainty . Blemishes in imaging , such as autofluorescence of protein aggregates in the region of interest , were not specifically eliminated ; therefore , our measured effect might be underestimated in some cases . Live - cell imaging was not analysed past 40 h . The plots in Fig . 6 were done by first segmenting the images based on H2B intensity into expressing and non - expressing voxels using Otsu thresholding . The H2B mask was then applied to the SMAD1 signal to account only for the nuclear SMAD1 . The levels were normalized by dividing the SMAD1 intensity by the average SMAD1 intensity of the first ten frames of all the videos . A note on preparation variability . Both tested hydrogels yielded symmetry - broken structures ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , demonstrating the robustness of the phenomenon . The preparation quality of the epiblast models was strongly dependent on how cells and gels were mixed . In the case of poor cell dissociation , large clumps would form and resembled embryoid bodies . In the Mebiol , improper gel mixing would result in a patchy gel mix and therefore a coexistence of pluripotent model epiblasts and differentiated colonies as part of the Matrigel patch . In general , non - structured cell clusters , such as loose cells or disintegrating structures , were ignored . Furthermore , the quality of the preparation deteriorates with the refrigeration time of both the hydrated gels and Matrigel . It is also crucial to ensure that the cells do not show signs of differentiation before dissociation . Cavitated 3D colonies can be easily distinguished with bright - field microscopy . A good preparation is characterized by an abundance of cavitated colonies embedded in a gel after about 3 d of growth with no or very few loose cells or structureless colonies 44 . In the filter experiments , the BRA domains were typically circular ; however , there was variability where BRA domains seemed to be patchier and less organized , which we attribute to an initial higher seeding density , with the details to be explored in the future . Data statistics and reproducibility . The population fractions shown in the pie charts were generated by first imaging a number of epithelial 3D colonies from random areas on a dish regardless of their expression and , second , manually counting the number of colonies with a given combination of marker expression . The population fractions were similar in IF and live - cell imaging and were therefore pooled in Fig . 2 ; the individual contributions are reported in Supplementary Fig . 2 . These experiments were done in Mebiol gel . Additional data for quantification , where only symmetry - broken colonies were considered , were obtained by considering only the BRA + / SOX2 + colonies ( or equivalent , for example SNAIL + / SOX2 + ) and imaging them at a higher magnification and resolution . These were conducted either in Mebiol or Biogelx gel , as indicated . The sample number for each experiment , listed in the figure caption as n , refers to the number of imaged individual 3D colonies and all statistics were derived by treating the individual 3D colonies as independent . The statistics in Fig . 1 for the pluripotency measurement of 3D colonies in the hydrogel / Matrigel mix were generated from three independently run experiments ; however , similar qualitative results were seen in live - cell imaging of the RUES2 - GLR ( 49 imaged colonies from a single imaging experiment ) and the RUES2 - GLR DKK1 KO cell lines ( 17 imaged colonies from a single imaging experiment ) under pluripotency conditions . The main experiment ( 3D epiblast model stimulated with 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 and probed for symmetry breaking ) was repeated over the course of 18 months in 7 independently run experiments where the endpoint was IF stained for BRA and SOX2 , and these data were used to generate the statistics in Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ( such as the symmetry - breaking metrics ) . In addition , the main experiment was repeated in three independently run experiments and probed with BRA / SOX2 live - cell imaging , and these data were used to generate the plots in Fig . 5 and Supplementary Fig . 5 . SNAIL expression was confirmed in four independent experiments , two of which were co - stained for SNAIL and SOX2 and these data were used to generate the plot in Fig . 4 . Uniform SMAD1 activation was observed in two independently run live - cell imaging experiments at 1 ng ml − 1 BMP4 and two live - imaging experiments at 10 ng ml − 1 . Given the low endogenous expression of the protein and the strong interference from the surrounding gel , the measured levels between experiments cannot be compared , the data from eight separate colonies from the same live - imaging experiment ( selected for showing higher signal - to - noise ratio ) were therefore quantified for the plots in Fig . 6 . All gene expression measurements from patterned tissue on filters were done on at least three independently run experiments ( biological replicates ) and each dot in the RT – qPCR plots in Supplementary Fig . 7 represents an average from two or three technical replicates . All other IF stains were confirmatory of the main conclusion and they were done by taking an aliquot from an experiment where the BRA and SOX2 expression was confirmed ( and independently replicated , as stated above ) . Thus , these stains were done only in single or double replicates for the exact same antibody combination ; note , however , that most markers overlap between different experiments or have independently been confirmed with live - cell imaging . Namely , BRA , E - CAD and N - CAD ; SNAIL , COLL IV and N - CAD ; SNAIL , SOX2 and N - CAD ; SNAIL and ZO - 1 ; SNAIL , SOX2 and NANOG ; BRA , GATA3 and SOX17 ; and BRA and pSMAD1 were stained from a single aliquot of a separately confirmed BRA + / SOX2 + sample for these exact combination of markers , whereas BRA , COLL IV and N - CAD ; BRA , SOX2 and NANOG ; and BRA , GATA3 and SOX2 were stained in aliquots from two different BRA + / SOX2 + experiments for these exact combination of markers . In the experiments testing the effect of NOGGIN , the experiment was repeated twice with the NOGGIN KO line . No differentiation was observed in a single experiment with the WNT inhibitor IWR1 - endo and in a single experiment with an alternative WNT inhibitor IWP2 , and it was not further explored . In testing the importance of the NODAL pathway , the main experiment was done once using the LEFTY1 and CER1 KO cell line resulting in the same phenotype as the WT and it was thus not further explored , whereas the experiment using the NODAL inhibitor SB - 431542 with the WT line was done three times .

In addition , separate experiments were run to collect more data at higher resolution for quantification , by only imaging the colonies with a given marker combination , and these were not included in population statistics in the pie charts . The n , reported in each figure caption and throughout the text , related to microscopy imaging , represents the number of individual 3D colonies that were imaged for that combination of immunofluorescence markers or , in case of live - cell imaging , for that particular transgenic cell line . The main result was repeated at least 7 times independently over the course of at least 18 months using immunofluorescence staining and in at least 3 independent experiments with live - cell imaging . The n , relating to filter experiments , represent the number of individually run experiments on separate filter - grown tissues . Data exclusions There was no exclusion of numerical data based on outliers per se . As described in the text , the patterned 3D colonies were categorized based on the combination of expressing markers and each category separately analyzed , in both IF and live - cell imaging . After establishing the symmetry - breaking phenotype using BRA / SOX2 dichotomy , further derivative markers for better characterization of the phenomenon ( e . g . , N - CAD , SNAIL , COLL IV , etc . ) were carried out by only imaging the symmetry - broken structures based on criteria explained in the text . In live - cell imaging , few examples were discarded either due to very poor fluorescence signal that prevented categorization ( usually if the colony is suspended far above the dish surface or moves up ) , due to cell death , presence of too many loose cells unrelated to the colony , or adhesion to the dish surface . Any nonspecific cell clusters such as those that failed to form an epithelium as well as large agglomerates that occur in 3D cultures in general ( organoids or otherwise ) were not imaged . In live - cell imaging , as described in the text , the data analysis was carried out until the onset of EMT as the separation of cells from the colony obfuscates the symmetry - breaking metrics . Replication The self - organization of hESCs into a 3D human epiblast model and the BMP4 - concentration - dependent patterning was confirmed in multiple experiments as described . The key result was replicated in 7 independent experiments probing the BRA / SOX2 asymmetry over the course of at least 20 months and in 3 independent experiments using live - cell imaging . Symmetry breaking was further observed with many other experiments probing other signatures of the primitive streak ( as described in the text ) . The main result in 3D was further replicated in an equivalent 2D system , as described in the text . Randomization There were no experimental groups that could be randomized . Blinding There were no animal or human subjects in the experiments , and the experimenters had no control over the outcome of cell biology experiments , therefore no blinding was done .

Validation All antibodies used have been tested and validated by the supplier and also by other researchers in the field . The dilution of each antibody was used based on a thorough prior investigation both in our labs and in other labs . Eukaryotic cell lines Policy information about cell lines Cell line source ( s ) The RUES2 and RUES1 cell lines were previously created in our lab and are listed in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry . They were derived under the approval from the Tri - Institutional Stem Cell Initiative Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight ( Tri - SCI ESCRO ) Committee , an independent committee charged with oversight of research with human pluripotent stem cells and embryos to ensure conformance with University policies , and guidelines from the U . S . National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) Authentication The cell lines and their derivatives were thoroughly authenticated by sequencing , karyotyping , and by verifying that they remain pluripotent in extended culture and that they can give rise to all three germ layers under controlled differentiation conditions . Mycoplasma contamination The lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . Commonly misidentified lines ( See ICLAC register ) No commonly misidentified cell lines were used . Flow Cytometry Plots Confirm that : The axis labels state the marker and fluorochrome used ( e . g . CD4 - FITC ) . The axis scales are clearly visible .
