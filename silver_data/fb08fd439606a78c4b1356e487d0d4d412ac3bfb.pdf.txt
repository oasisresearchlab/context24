A r t i c l e s 404 VOLUME 18 NUMBER 4 APRIL 2011 nAture structurAl & moleculAr biology Activator proteins regulate eukaryotic RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) transcription in response to developmental and environmental signals . They bind to the DNA recognition sites of target genes with a sequence - specific DNA - binding domain , and recruit components of the Pol II machinery through a transcriptional activation domain ( TAD ) 1 , 2 . Activators have been classified as acidic , glutamine - rich , proline - rich and serine / threonine - rich , depending on the prepon - derance of amino acids in their TAD 3 . An archetypal acidic activator is the herpes simplex virus protein 16 ( VP16 ) , which activates the expression of immediate early viral genes during infection 4 – 8 . VP16 exerts its activating function through a C - terminal TAD that includes residues 413 – 490 ( refs . 9 – 13 ) . The VP16 TAD has been intensely used for studying transcrip - tional activation . Usually , the VP16 TAD is fused with its N terminus to the DNA - binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 . The resulting Gal4 - VP16 activator fusion protein stimulates transcription from promoters that contain Gal4 - binding sites in the yeast and mammalian transcription systems in vivo 14 , 15 and in vitro 16 , 17 . This indicates that basic mechanisms of transcrip - tion activation are conserved amongst eukaryotes . The VP16 TAD targets basal Pol II transcription factors , including TFIIA , TFIIB , TFIID , the TFIIH subunit Tfb1 / p62 ( yeast / human ) and the Mediator co - activator 18 – 23 . The VP16 TAD binds the Mediator subunit Med25 ( also called Arc92 ) 24 – 27 , which is specific to higher eukaryotes . Med25 consists of two domains , the activa - tor interaction domain ( ACID ) 24 that binds the VP16 TAD , and a ‘von Willebrand factor type A’ domain that anchors Med25 to Mediator 24 . Mediator generally conveys regulatory information by forming a bridge between activators and the basal Pol II machin - ery 28 , 29 . Whereas information on the core Mediator structure is emerging , structural information about its more peripheral activator - binding domains is limited to the KIX domain in subunit Med15 ( or Arc105 ) 30 , 31 . The VP16 TAD is intrinsically flexible , whereas the VP16 core domain ( residues 49 – 402 ) forms a stable structure 23 , 32 – 34 . The TAD contains two functional subdomains , H1 ( residues 410 – 452 ) and H2 ( residues 453 – 490 ) , which activate transcription independently 35 , 36 . Both H1 and H2 contain acidic amino acids , but specific bulky hydro - phobic and aromatic residues are required for their function 36 – 39 . H2 has been proposed to adopt an α - helical conformation when bound to TFIIB 40 . NMR analysis revealed a nine - residue amphipathic α - helix in H2 that docks onto a PH fold in Tfb1 21 . On the basis of these and other results it is assumed that acidic TADs are flexible in their free state , but become transiently structured upon interaction with their target proteins . Here we report the NMR structure of the Mediator Med25 ACID and analyze its structural and functional interaction with the VP16 TAD . The structure revealed a fold that has not previously been described in activator target domains . NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis combined with biochemical assays showed that VP16 TAD interacts with an extended surface of Med25 , in contrast to its known interaction with Tfb1 . These results show that a canonical acidic TAD can adapt to unrelated target surfaces , and shows that diverse protein folds have evolved for TAD binding . 1 Gene Center and Department of Biochemistry , Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich ( CIPSM ) , Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München , Munich , Germany . 2 Institute of Structural Biology , Helmholtz Zentrum München , Neuherberg , Germany . 3 Biomolecular NMR and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich ( CIPSM ) , Department Chemie , Garching , Germany . 4 European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( EMBL ) , Heidelberg , Germany . 5 Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology , University of Muenster , Muenster , Germany . 6 Present address : Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics , Department of Biochemistry , University of Oxford , Oxford , UK .

Here we report the NMR structure of the Mediator subunit Med25 ( also called Arc92 ) activator interaction domain ( ACID ) and analyze the structural and functional interaction of ACID with the archetypical acidic transcription activator VP16 . Unlike other known activator targets , ACID forms a seven - stranded  - barrel framed by three helices . The VP16 subdomains H1 and H2 bind to opposite faces of ACID and cooperate during promoter - dependent activated transcription in a in vitro system . The activator - binding ACID faces are functionally required and conserved among higher eukaryotes . Comparison with published activator structures reveals that the VP16 activation domain uses distinct interaction modes to adapt to unrelated target surfaces and folds that evolved for activator binding . © 201 1 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nAture structurAl & moleculAr biology VOLUME 18 NUMBER 4 APRIL 2011 405 RESULTSMed25 ACID solution structure We prepared recombinant human Med25 ACID ( residues 394 – 543 ; Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and determined its solution struc - ture using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy ( Online Methods and Table 1 ) . The secondary structure is defined by 13 C second - ary chemical shifts and supported by H - D exchange experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The ensemble of ten lowest - energy con - formers is shown in Figure 1b . ACID comprises a seven - stranded β - barrel framed by three α - helices ( Fig . 1c ) . The β - barrel consists of antiparallel strands ( β 1 , Leu400 – Trp408 ; β 2 , Arg425 – Asn434 ; β 3 , Gln446 – Pro454 ; β 4 , Ser468 – Phe475 ; β 5 , Phe494 – His499 ; β 6 , Val510 – Ser516 ; β 7 , Ile521 – Ile526 ) , with the exception of a short parallel arrangement between residues Val405 and Trp408 in β 1 and residues Lys447 and Met450 in β 3 . Helix α 1 ( Gln455 – Arg466 ) , between β 3 and β 4 , is slightly kinked at residues Gly462 and Pro463 , resulting in a 3 10 - helix at residues Gly462 – Arg466 . Helix α 2 ( Leu480 – Met490 ) connects strands β 4 and β 5 , and helix α 3 ( Gln530 – Asn543 ) forms the C - terminal region . Helix α 3 is well defined by short - range NOEs . It is poised away from the central protein core , but nevertheless its ori - entation is well defined on the basis of eight NOEs to residues in the core domain . Loops β 1 – β 2 ( Lys411 – Leu423 ) , β 2 – β 3 ( His435 – Lys440 ) and β 5 – β 6 ( Phe500 – Arg509 ) contain highly mobile regions , consist - ent with the paucity of NOEs , 13 C secondary chemical shifts and low { 1 H } - 15 N heteronuclear NOE values ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . A novel activator target fold We carried out a structural similarity search with DALI 41 but found no known activator target domains . However , the overall fold of Med25 ACID resembled the Spen paralog and ortholog C - terminal ( SPOC ) domain in the human transcriptional co - repressor SHARP 42 ( Fig . 1c ) and the β - barrel fold in the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits of the heterodimeric DNA repair factor Ku70 – Ku80 ( ref . 43 ) . The SPOC domain shares the central β - barrel and two flanking helices with Med25 ACID , but differs from the ACID structure by the presence of four additional helices ( green in Fig . 1c ) . Helices α C and α D of the SPOC domain correspond topologically to helices α 1 and α 2 , respectively , of ACID ( Fig . 1c ) , whereas the SPOC domain also con - tains two N - terminal and two C - terminal helices . The N - terminal helices α A and α B enclose the first two strands in the barrel , whereas the C - terminal helices α E and α F are inserted into a loop between β 6 and β 7 . Compared to that of ACID , the central β - barrel of the SPOC domain shows a discontinuity in strand β 3 and a disruption of the characteristic pattern of hydrogen bonds between β 3 ′ and the adja - cent strand β 5 . Therefore , ACID differs from the SPOC domain by the absence of four helices that flank the barrel in the SPOC domain and by the presence of a C - terminal helix α 3 with a unique location and a long loop connecting β 1 and β 2 . The VP16 TAD binds a large surface of Med25 ACID To study the binding of ACID to the VP16 TAD , we expressed the VP16 TAD as an N - terminal fusion protein with the Gal4 DNA - binding domain ( see Supplementary Methods ) . Using a TEV protease cleavage site between the Gal4 domain and TAD , we prepared milli - gram quantities of a stable variant of VP16 TAD with a hexahistidine tag at its C terminus . To identify the surface of ACID that interacts with the VP16 TAD , we performed NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments . We recorded 2D 1 H , 15 N HSQC spectra of 15 N - labeled ACID during successive additions of VP16 TAD .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 406 VOLUME 18 NUMBER 4 APRIL 2011 nAture structurAl & moleculAr biology A r t i c l e s changes occurred upon TAD binding ( Fig . 2a ) . The binding was in the fast to intermediate exchange regime on the NMR chemical shift time scale ( Fig . 2 ) . Saturation was achieved at about equimolar concentra - tion of TAD and ACID , indicating a high - affinity interaction in the low micromolar to high nanomolar range . Numerous residues showed substantial chemical shift changes upon addition of VP16 TAD ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Additional residues experienced substan - tial line - broadening , which suggests that there was conformational exchange in the binding interface ( Figs . 2b – d , 3 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Mapping the affected residues onto the ACID structure revealed that VP16 TAD shared an extended binding interface with ACID ( Fig . 2d ) . These data suggest that the VP16 TAD engages in numerous contacts over a large surface area of ACID that comprises the central β - barrel and helices α 1 and α 3 at multiple sites . TAD subdomains H1 and H2 bind opposite ACID faces To investigate whether the two TAD subdomains contacted distinct patches on the extended ACID activator - binding surface , we car - ried out NMR titration experiments with the isolated H2 subdomain ( Fig . 2e ) . Saturation was achieved only at eight - fold molar excess of H2 over ACID , indicating that the interaction with H2 was weaker than the interaction with the complete TAD . The NMR signals of many residues showed substantial line - broadening at two - fold molar excess of the VP16 TAD , presumably linked to conformational dynamics , and thus could not be further analyzed . However , there are already substantial chemical shift perturbations at a 1 . 5 - fold molar excess of H2 over ACID , affecting a number of residues on one face of the ACID structure ( Fig . 2e – g ) . Residues on the opposite face , such as Leu406 and Glu407 , which were affected in the titration experiments with the complete TAD , did not show chemical shift changes upon addition of H2 even at saturating concentrations . More generally , residues that were perturbed by H2 binding formed a subset of the residues that were a VP16 TAD ( H1 + H2 ) VP16 H1 413 – 451 413 490 VP16 H2 452 – 490 Phe442 Phe473Phe475Phe479 Arg466 180 ° Arg466 180 ° 10 . 6 9 . 5 9 . 3 105 110 115 120 125 130 126 . 7 127 . 7 128 . 7 9 . 2 9 . 0 8 . 8 Glu407 Leu406 9 . 1 8 . 9 116 . 9 117 . 9 118 . 9 Val471 Gln456 10 . 19 . 6 9 . 1 8 . 6 8 . 1 7 . 6 7 . 1 6 . 6 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 15 N ( p . p . m . ) 126 . 7 127 . 7 128 . 7 9 . 2 9 . 0 8 . 8 Glu407 Leu406 9 . 5 9 . 3 9 . 1 8 . 9 116 . 9 117 . 9 118 . 9 Val471 Gln456 10 . 610 . 19 . 6 9 . 1 8 . 6 8 . 1 7 . 6 7 . 1 6 . 6 1 H ( p . p . m . ) 105 110 115 120 125 130 b e g f c d ∆ � ( p . p . m . ) VP16 TAD 1 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 396 421 446 471 496 521 543 ACID residue number VP16 H2 ∆ � ( p . p . m . ) 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 396 421 446 471 496 521 543 ACID residue number Figure 2 VP16 – ACID interaction .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nAture structurAl & moleculAr biology VOLUME 18 NUMBER 4 APRIL 2011 407 A r t i c l e s perturbed upon binding of the entire TAD . Whereas H1 binds to one ACID face , H2 binds to the opposite face of the domain ( Fig . 3 ) . Both subdomain - binding faces contain conserved exposed residues ( Val405 , Leu423 and Lys447 on the H1 face ; Leu514 , Arg466 and Met470 on the H2 face ) that might interact with residues of VP16 required for its function 37 , 39 . These results indicate that the TAD subdomains H1 and H2 do not compete for the same ACID surface but rather bind to distinct H1 - and H2 - binding patches on opposite faces of ACID . VP16 – ACID interaction relies on a conserved basic residue To further investigate the TAD – ACID interaction biochemically , we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ; Online Methods ) . This assay used a fluorescently labeled DNA encompassing a Gal4 - binding site and allowed us to monitor the formation of a binary complex of the Gal4 - VP16 fusion protein with DNA , and also the formation of a ternary complex of the Gal4 - VP16 – DNA complex with ACID ( Fig . 4a ) . Formation of the ternary complex was seen as a supershift in the EMSA assay , and directly indicated an interaction between VP16 and ACID . To probe structural determinants in the interface , we mutated sites on ACID that showed strong perturbations in the NMR titration experiments . We generated 16 point mutant variants of ACID ( Q455A , Q456A , L458A , T459A , T459V , R466E , R466A , S468A , V471A , V471L , L514A , S516A , K518A , K519A , L525V and L525A ) and tested their interaction with VP16 . All variants of ACID bound VP16 in the EMSA supershift assay ( data not shown ) , except the charge - reversal variant R466E , which abolished the super - shift ( Fig . 4a ) . These results confirm that binding of VP16 to ACID is robust and might rely on multiple redundant contacts , and they show that residue Arg466 of ACID forms a crucial interaction ‘hot spot’ . This basic residue lies within the H2 - binding face ( Fig . 3 ) and is conserved among ACID homologs ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Functional VP16 interaction with TAD - binding ACID surface To investigate whether the characterized interaction between VP16 and ACID is functionally important during activated transcription , we established a quenching assay . We performed in vitro activated transcription assays with yeast nuclear extracts on the HIS4 promoter with an upstream Gal4 - binding site 44 . The Gal4 - VP16 fusion protein is a potent transcriptional activator in this system ( Fig . 4b , lane 1 ) . The addition of recombinant ACID quenches the transcription signal , appar - ently by competing with VP16 targets in the yeast extract ( Fig . 4b , lanes 2 – 4 ) . Thus this assay monitors whether human ACID interferes with functional interactions between VP16 and the basal Pol II machinery during activated transcription in vitro . We tested five of the above recom - binant ACID point mutant variants in the quenching assay . The variants quenched the transcription signal to different extents , but generally less than wild - type ACID , supporting the idea that the residues identified in NMR titration are involved in VP16 binding ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , lanes 1 – 13 ) . The ACID variant R466E had the strongest effect and only quenched transcription to a low extent ( Fig . 4b , lanes 5 – 7 ) , consistent with its key role in VP16 binding as observed in the EMSA assay . H1 and H2 cooperate during transcription activation in yeast To evaluate the contributions of the VP16 subdomains to the activation of transcription in yeast , we prepared fusion proteins of the Gal4 DNA - binding domain with wild - type H1 or H2 , with H1 or H2 mutated at functionally required hydrophobic residues , and with TAD mutated at Figure 4 Functional ACID - VP16 interaction . ( a ) EMSA supershift assay . The complex formed by DNA and Gal4 - VP16 ( lane 2 ) underwent a supershift with increasing concentrations of wild - type ACID ( lanes 4 – 6 ) . This supershift was abolished by ACID point mutation R466E ( lane 7 – 9 ) . ( b ) ACID quenched VP16 activation in a yeast transcription system . Assays were performed with yeast nuclear extracts ( lane 1 ) or extracts with increasing amounts ( 10 , 100 or 400 pmol ) of wild - type ACID ( lanes 2 – 4 ) or ACID variant R466E ( lanes 5 – 7 ) . Transcription was quenched by recombinant ACID , but not by ACID variant R466E . ( c ) VP16 subdomains H1 and H2 activated yeast transcription in a synergistic , rather than competitive , manner . Transcription in yeast nuclear extracts was monitored in the absence ( lanes 1 , 10 ) or the presence of different Gal4 - VP16 variants , including Gal4 fusions with VP16 TAD ( lanes 2 , 3 , 11 , 12 ) , TAD carrying the H1 subdomain mutation F442P ( H1mt ; lanes 4 , 5 ) , H1 ( lanes 6 , 7 ) , H1mt ( lanes 8 , 9 ) , TAD carrying the H2 subdomain mutations F473A F475A F479A ( H2mt ; lanes 13 , 14 ) , H2 ( lanes 15 , 16 ) and H2mt ( lanes 17 , 18 ) . ( d ) ACID inhibited transcription activation by VP16 in mammalian B - cell nuclear extracts . Assays were performed with nuclear extracts ( lane 1 ) or extracts with increasing amounts ( 530 or 850 pmol ) of wild - type ACID ( lanes 2 , 3 ) or specific ACID point mutants ( lanes 4 – 13 ) . The R466E variant of ACID hardly quenched transcription ( lanes 4 , 5 ) , whereas other ACID variants did to various extents ( lanes 6 – 13 ) .

In these assays H2 , but not H1 , could activate transcription alone , albeit weakly ( Fig . 4c , lanes 6 , 7 , 15 , 16 ) . Consistently , TAD that carried a mutation in H2 supported acti - vated transcription only weakly ( Fig . 4c , lanes 13 , 14 ) , whereas TAD that carried a mutation in H1 strongly activated transcription , to nearly the levels of wild - type TAD ( Fig . 4c , lanes 4 , 5 ) . Thus , the VP16 TAD subdomains H1 and H2 cooperate during activated transcription in the yeast system , with the main contribution coming from H2 . The ACID - VP16 interaction is functional in the human system Finally , we investigated whether the characterized VP16 – ACID inter - action is relevant in transcription activation in the human system . We investigated the quenching of activated transcription in human B - cell nuclear extracts by wild - type ACID and five ACID point mutant vari - ants ( Fig . 4d , lanes 1 – 13 ) . Consistent with our observations in the yeast transcription system , the addition of wild - type ACID quenched tran - scriptional activation ( Fig . 4d , lanes 2 , 3 ) whereas addition of the R466E variant showed hardly any effect ( Fig . 4d , lanes 4 , 5 ) . Furthermore , we studied the capability of ACID to interfere with another activator , SP1 . ACID , but not the ACID variant R466E , quenched transcription activa - tion by SP1 ( Supplementary Fig . 3b , lanes 6 – 10 ) , indicating that ACID uses the same binding surface for diverse activators . Thus , the VP16 - ACID interface characterized here by NMR is functionally relevant in the yeast and human transcription systems . DISCUSSION An important goal in the field of transcription regulation is to under - stand how activators function through the central coactivator complex Mediator ( Fig . 5 ) . Mediator integrates signals from activators bound upstream of the core promoter where Pol II and the basal factors assemble into the initiation complex . Structural information on acti - vator - binding Mediator subunits and their activator interactions at a molecular level are an essential step toward this goal . We have described the solution structure of the VP16 activator inter - action domain in the human Mediator , the ACID domain in Mediator subunit Med25 . We showed by NMR titration that VP16 binds to an extended surface of ACID and assigned two opposite faces to the inter - action with the VP16 TAD subdomains H1 and H2 . Consistently , H1 and H2 bind to ACID in a noncompetitive manner and cooperate during pro - moter - dependent activated transcription in yeast . The TAD - binding ACID surface is conserved among higher eukaryotes and is functionally relevant because it is required for efficient quenching of transcription in vitro . Until now , structural information on activator - binding domains in Mediator was limited to the KIX domain in subunit Med15 ( Arc105 ) 30 , 31 . This domain shows an entirely α - helical fold , in strong contrast to ACID , which contains a central β - barrel fold ( Fig . 6 ) . More generally , the fold of Med25 ACID is unique amongst known activator target domains 21 , 45 – 47 such as Tfb1 , Mdm2 , PAS - B and the CBP KIX domain , which are all unre - lated in structure ( Fig . 6 ) . However , there are two domains with a fold that resembles that of Med25 ACID in another human protein , PTOV1 , which is overexpressed in prostate cancers 48 and is involved in cell proliferation 49 ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . As the amino acid residues of Med25 ACID that are involved in TAD binding are generally conserved in PTOV1 , the two domains probably serve as activator - binding modules ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In contrast to the variety of target domain folds , activators form similar hel - ical segments in all available structures of activator – target complexes 21 , 45 – 47 ( Fig . 6 ) . Unfortunately , we could not resolve an NMR structure of the VP16 TAD – ACID complex owing to substantial line - broadening of NMR sig - nals in the binding interface ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Nevertheless , analy - sis of 13 C secondary chemical shifts for the bound H2 peptide suggested that a central region comprising residues Ala471 – Ala482 adopts a helical conformation ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The line - broadening observed in both ACID and VP16 TAD suggests that the complex and the binding interface show conformational dynamics . As the ACID – TAD interaction is nevertheless tight and specific , this suggests that the activator might adopt multiple conformations on the same target surface . Such conformational flexibility is consistent with the general observation that activators form structured segments only transiently upon interaction with their targets through induced folding of helical segments 23 , 50 . Conformation flexibility in TADs also explains the promiscuity of activators with respect to different target surfaces . In particular , VP16 binds different target proteins in the yeast and human systems . VP16 is a very strong activator in yeast even though yeast Mediator contains neither Med25 nor another subunit with ACID homology . Although the specific VP16 targets differ , VP16 TAD uses its two subdomains H1 and H2 in a synergistic manner in both systems , indicating that the yeast transcription machinery contains at least two nonoverlapping sites that can bind to the two TAD subdomains . Our results provide insights into the evolution of Mediator and Mediator - dependent transcription regulation . Whereas the yeast Mediator contains 25 subunits that are mostly conserved throughout the eukaryotes 25 , Mediator in higher eukaryotes contains additional , specific subunits and forms sev - eral distinct multiprotein subcomplexes 51 , 52 . The conserved Mediator core apparently contains a limited number of activator - binding target domains , whereas additional target domains are present on the extended surfaces of Mediator complexes from higher eukaryotes . The increase in target domain number and types might have made possible more complex transcrip - tional regulation . This might include processes that are specific to higher eukaryotes , such as differentiation or immune responses , and increased cooperativity might have allowed sharper on - off transitions . Surface exten - sion of Mediator complexes during evolution was probably facilitated by the ability of activators to adapt to different targets .

Details of cloning , protein expression and purification are described in Supplementary Methods . NMR spectroscopy . All NMR spectra were recorded at 295 K on Bruker DRX600 and 900 spectrometers with cryogenic triple resonance probes using a 13 C , 15 N - labeled ACID sample . Data were processed with NMRPipe 59 and analyzed using NMRView 60 . Backbone sequential resonances were assigned using 3D HNCA , HNCACB , HN ( CO ) CA , HN ( CO ) CACB experiments and side chain resonances were assigned using 3D HCCH - TOCSY experiments 61 . Secondary structure ele - ments were identified by analysis of 13 C secondary chemical shifts and H - D exchange experiments as well as NOE pattern . Distance constraints were collected from 3D 15 N - edited NOESY ( τ m = 90 ms ) , 3D 13 C - edited NOESY ( τ m = 90 ms ) and 2D 1 H - NOESY ( τ m = 90 ms ) spectra 61 . Information on backbone dynamics was derived from 15 N relaxation experiments comprising measurements of T1 , T2 and { 1 H - } 15 N heteronuclear NOEs 62 . The interactions of VP16 H2 and VP16 TAD with Med25 ACID were moni - tored by comparing 2D 1 H , 15 N HSQC spectra of the 13 C , 15 N - labeled VP16 H2 ( 0 . 8 mM ) or VP16 TAD ( 0 . 28 mM ) protein alone and in the presence of equimo - lar unlabeled ACID protein at 295 K in 2 . 5 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 4 mM DTT and 10 % ( v / v ) D 2 O on Bruker 600 - MHz ( VP16 H2 ) or 900 - MHz ( VP16 TAD ) spectrometers equipped with a cryoprobe . For 13 C , 15 N - labeled VP16 H2 , backbone experiments were recorded . Structure calculations . Automated NOE assignment and structure calculations were carried out with the standard protocol in CYANA version 2 . 1 ( ref . 63 ) . After seven iterative cycles of automated NOE assignment , 85 % of NOESY peaks were assigned . NOEs assignments and completeness of NOEs were manually checked . NOE - derived distance restraints from CYANA calculations , dihedral angle restraints derived from TALOS + 58 , and hydrogen bonds derived from H - D exchange experiments were applied in a simulated annealing protocol in CNS 64 for a water - refinement calculation 56 . Out of 100 calculated structures , an ensemble of ten structures with the lowest energy was used for validation with PROCHECK - NMR 57 and iCING ( G . W . Vuister , Univ . Nijmegen ; http : / / nmr . cmbi . ru . nl / icing / ) . Ramachandran plot analysis of the final structures , including residues 395 – 409 , 425 – 500 and 509 – 543 , with PROCHECK - NMR 57 showed that 92 . 0 % , 7 . 1 % , 0 . 5 % and 0 . 4 % of residues are in the most favored , additionally allowed , generously allowed and disallowed regions , respectively . WHATCHECK 65 was used for analysis using the iCING web server . NMR titration . Chemical shift mapping on ACID was done by monitoring the 2D 1 H , 15 N HSQC spectra of the uniformly 15 N - labeled ACID protein alone ( 0 . 22 – 0 . 3 mM ) and with an excess of unlabeled interacting proteins until no further changes in chemical shifts were observed in the 2D 1 H , 15 N HSQC spec - tra . The HSQC spectra were recorded at 295 K in 2 . 5 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 4 mM DTT and 10 % ( v / v ) D 2 O on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe . The values were calculated using the equation ∆δ = { [ ∆δ ( 1 H ) 2 + [ 0 . 2 * ∆δ ( 15 N ) ] } 1 / 2 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Binding reactions ( 20 µ l ) contained 5 pmol Gal4 - VP16 and 5 , 50 or 150 pmol ACID variants . We used 1 pmol of a DNA duplex with sequence 5 ′ - GGGGATCGATCCGGGTGACAGCCCTCCGAATTC GAGCTCG - 3 ′ , containing a single Gal4 - binding site ( underlined ) . After incuba - tion for 20 min at room temperature , ACID variants were added accordingly and the mixture was incubated for 10 min . Formed complexes were separated on 5 % ( v / v ) acrylamide gels in TGOE buffer ( 0 . 25 M Tris , pH 8 . 3 , 1 . 9 M glycine ) . Bands were quantified with a Typhoon 9400 scanner and the ImageQuant Software ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Activated transcription in nuclear extracts . Yeast nuclear extracts were pre - pared from three liters of culture as described ( http : / / www . fhcrc . org / labs / hahn ) . Yeast in vitro transcription and analysis by primer extension were as described 66 . Reactions contained 150 µ g nuclear extracts , 5 pmol Gal4 - VP16 and 10 , 100 or 400 pmol ACID variant . All in vitro transcription reactions with the mammalian B - cell nuclear extract were performed in a 20 µ l reaction volume . The standard reaction mixture contained 25 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 2 , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 5 mM DTT , 20 U RiboLock RNase Inhibitor , 0 . 5 mg ml −1 BSA , 0 . 005 % ( v / v ) Igepal , 2 . 5 µ M ATP , 1× Protease inhibitor ( EDTA free ) , 100 ng pGalML linearized with SmaI , 6 . 5 µ l Raji cell nuclear extract , 530 or 850 pmol ACID variant and 1 . 6 pmol Gal4 - VP16 or 3 . 5 pmol Gal94 - SP1 . HEPES , MgCl 2 , DTT , RiboLock RNase Inhibitor , BSA , Igepal , ATP , Protease inhibitor and linearized pGalML were mixed with the ACID variant , ACID buffer and Gal4 - VP16 or Gal94 - SP1 . Following 12 min incubation at 25 °C the nuclear extract was added and the reaction mixture was centrifuged and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C . Afterwards 5 µ Ci ( α - 32 P ) UTP ( 3000 Ci mmol −1 ) , 0 , 1 µ M ATP , CTP , GTP and 10 µ M UTP were added and the reaction mixture incubated for 1 h at 25 °C . Subsequently 25 mM GTP , ATP , CTP , and UTP were added , the mixture was centrifuged and the reaction was continued for 15 min at 30 °C . In vitro transcription reactions were stopped by adding 200 µ g yeast tRNA and 400 µ l transcription stop buffer ( 7 M urea , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 , 10 mM EDTA / NaOH , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) SDS , 100 mM LiCl , 300 mM , sodium acetate , pH 5 . 2 ) and the RNA was isolated by phenol - chloroform extraction , precipitated with isopropanol at −20 °C for at least 2 h , pelleted by centrifugation ( 45 min , 4 °C , 16 , 873 g ) washed in each case once with 70 % ( v / v ) and 100 % ethanol , air dried for 15 min and then resuspended in 10 µ l formamid loading buffer . RNA samples were shaken for 15 min at 50 °C and after - wards loaded on a 5 % ( v / v ) polyacrylamide gel with 8 M urea . The gel was run at constant current ( 50 mA ) for 1 h and 50 min , and dried for one hour at 80 °C on the vacuum gel dryer . The dried gel was exposed to either a KODAK BioMax MS film ( Scientific Imaging Film ) or a phosphor - imager plate .
