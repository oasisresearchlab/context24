Here , we have shown an important role of CRT in tumorigenesis through enhancing cell motility and anoikis resistance . SiRNA - mediated knockdown of CRT caused impaired cell migration , invasion and resistance to anoikis . Notably , CRT downregulation decreased the expression of Cortactin ( CTTN ) , which has been previously reported as a candidate oncogene associated with anoikis through the PI3K – Akt pathway . In addition , Akt phosphorylation was abolished after CRT downregulation and its activa - tion can be refreshed by CRT upregulation , suggesting that CRT - enhanced cell resistance to anoikis through the CRT – CTTN – PI3K – Akt pathway . Moreover , the CTTN mRNA level was decreased in CRT – siRNA cells , coupled with the inactivation of STAT3 . Expression of both CTTN and p - STAT3 was reduced in tumor cells following incubation with the JAK - speciﬁc inhibitor , AG490 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed direct binding of p - STAT3 to the conservative STAT3 - binding sequences in CTTN promoter . Furthermore , overexpres - sion of CTTN in CRT - downregulated ESCC cells restored its motility and resistance to anoikis . This study not only reveals a role of CRT in motility promotion and anoikis resistance in ESCC cells , but also identiﬁes CRT as an upstream regulator in the CRT – STAT3 – CTTN – Akt pathway .

An improved understanding of the aberrant proteins in ESCC leads to new clues for investigation of carcino - genic mechanisms and identifying molecular markers for diagnosis or prognosis of ESCC . Our previous study identiﬁed 22 candidate proteins by proteomic analysis . Among them , we found that overexpression of Calreti - culin ( CRT ) predicted a poor prognosis of ESCC patients ( Du et al . , 2007 ) . CRT is an abundant , high - capacity Ca 2 þ - binding protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen of most cells of human origin . Its basic function is to have a critical role in quality control processes during protein synthesis and folding , through binding to misfolded proteins ( Tatu and Helenius , 1997 ) . CRT has also been implicated in a variety of functions outside of the endoplasmic reticulum , including cell adhesion , integrin - dependent Ca 2 þ signaling and expression of steroid - sensitive genes ( Michalak et al . , 1999 ) . CRT enhances cell migration and wound healing ( Gold et al . , 2006 ) , and inﬂuences apoptosis positively or negatively via modulation of intracellular calcium stores ( Mesaeli and Phillipson , 2004 ; Vanoverberghe et al . , 2004 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ) . Recent evidence has shown that CRT protects ﬁbroblasts from anoikis through binding to LRP1 and TSP - 1 ( Pallero et al . , 2008 ) . Akt activation or inactiva - tion has been reported to play an important role in CRT - associated apoptosis ( Kageyama et al . , 2002 ; Okunaga et al . , 2006 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ) . CRT - deﬁcient mice show embryonic lethal characteristics due to changes in cell adhesiveness and impairment of cardiac development and function ( Coppolino et al . , 1997 ; Rauch et al . , 2000 ; Mesaeli and Phillipson , 2004 ) . CRT may have an important role in the development and / or progression of various human cancers : over - expression of CRT has been found in breast ductal carcinoma ( Bini et al . , 1997 ; Chahed et al . , 2005 ) , prostate adenocarcinoma ( Alaiya et al . , 2000 ) , hepato - cellular carcinoma ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) and colon cancer ( Vougas et al . , 2008 ) . In ESCC , research by other groups and our previous ﬁnding suggests that CRT overexpression is a prevalent event in malignant Received 11 December 2008 ; revised 22 May 2009 ; accepted 28 June 2009 ; published online 17 August 2009 Correspondence : Professor M - R Wang , State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology , Cancer Institute ( Hospital ) , Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences , 17 Pan Jia Yuan , Chaoyang District , Beijing 100021 , China .

Importantly , we observed that patients with CRT overexpression presented a shorter survival time compared to those with low CRT expression . However , as yet , the precise role of CRT in ESCC tumorigenesis and progression remains unknown . The aim of this study was to investigate the function of CRT in ESCC cells and to address the fundamental question of whether CRT deregulation was involved in ESCC tumorigenesis or only a consequence of carcino - genesis . We have shown that repression of CRT decreased tumor formation in nude mice . Cellular function experiment showed that decreased expression of CRT by RNA interference ( RNAi ) impaired migration capacity and anoikis resistance of ESCC cells . More interestingly , we showed that downregula - tion of CRT decreased the expression of Cortactin ( CTTN ) , another anoikis - associated protein we pre - viously reported , through inhibiting the activation of STAT3 . This report provides the evidence that CRT is involved in CTTN – PI3K – Akt - signaling pathway and that CRT regulates the transcription of CTTN through STAT3 in ESCC . Results Reduced CRT expression decreases the motility of ESCC cells Haptotactic cell migration assay and Matrigel chemoin - vasion assay showed that CRT – siRNA cells migrated much more slowly than non - silencing siRNA cells and parental cells ( Figure 1a upper panel and 1c ) . The invasive potential of the CRT – siRNA cells , as assessed by measuring the ability of cells to transverse a reconstituted basement membrane of Matrigel , was reduced when compared with that of the control cells ( Figure 1a middle panel and 1c ) . By ﬂuorescently labeled phalloidin staining , CRT – siRNA cells showed a round , poorly adhesive phenotype as compared with non - silencing siRNA cells and the parental counterparts in ESCC ( Figure 1a lower panel ) . Western Blot shows the decrease of CRT protein in CRT – siRNA transfected cells ( Figure 1b ) . Reduced CRT expression in ESCC cells inhibits colony formation in soft agar and s . c . tumor growth in nude mice 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 5 - ( 3 - carboxymethoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sulfophenyl ) - 2H - tetrazolium MTS cell proliferation assays showed no signiﬁcant difference in the in vitro cell growth rates between CRT – RNAi , control RNAi and parental ESCC cells . However , colony - forming activity of CRT – RNAi cells under anchorage - independent condition was decreased compared with the control RNAi and parental ESCC cells in soft agar assay ( Figure 2a ) . Tumor formation assays in nude mice were carried out to further evaluate the effect of CRT expression on tumorigenesis in vivo . CRT – RNAi , control RNAi and parental tumori - genic ESCC cells were inoculated subcutaneously ( s . c . ) into nude mice . All the three groups of cells developed tumors , but the tumors formed by the control RNAi or parental ESCC cells grew faster than those by the CRT – Figure 1 CRT repression decreases cell migration and invasion .

RNAi of CRT promotes anoikis in ESCC cells Calreticulin downregulation did not affect cell cycle progression and apoptosis with or without induction of UV exposure treatment . However , when cultured on polyHEMA - coated dishes , CRT – siRNA - transefected cells formed small and loose aggregates compared with the control and parental cells ( Figure 3a ) . Of the transiently transfected cells , the proportion of apoptotic CRT – siRNA cells ( early and late apoptosis ) was approximately twofold higher than those for the control and parental ESCC cells ( Figures 3b and d ) . Western blot shows the decrease of CRT protein in CRT – siRNA transfected cells ( Figure 3c ) .

CRT promotes motility and resistance to anoikis via CTTN X - L Du et al 3716 Oncogene CRT regulates cell motility and resistance to anoikis through CTTN Cortactin has been reported to promote cell motility and resistance to anoikis ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Weaver , 2008 ) . Xenograft assays in nude mice showed decreased CTTN expression in tumor tissues with CRT repression ( Figure 2d ) . Western immunoblot analysis indicated that CTTN expression was signiﬁcantly lower in CRT – siRNA cells than in non - silencing siRNA and parental ESCC cells ( Figure 4a ) . In contrast , knockdown of CTTN did not affect CRT expression ( Figure 4b ) . When plasmid encoding the CTTN gene was transfected into cells with CRT knockdown , forced transient CTTN overexpression partially restored cell motility ( Figures 4c and d ) . As CTTN was expressed in non - silencing transfected cells and CRT – siRNA - transfected cells , elevated CTTN protein levels resulted in a decrease of apoptotic cells in ESCC cells in comparison with vector - transfected cells ( Figures 4e and f ) . Phospho - Akt was downregulated in CRT – siRNA ESCC cells ( Figure 4g ) . Furthermore , increased expression of CRT - activated Akt phosphorylation and enhanced the intracellular level of CTTN protein ( Figure 4h ) . STAT3 regulates CTTN transcription through binding to its promoter Reverse transcriptase – PCR assay showed that CTTN mRNA was reduced 5 – 6 fold in CRT – siRNA cells compared with non - silencing siRNA and parental ESCC cells ( Figures 5a and b ) . Online bioinformatics database searching ( http : / / www . cbrc . jp / research / db / TFSEARCH . html ) revealed several STAT3 - binding sites within the CTTN promoter region including (cid:2) 1003 , (cid:2) 1692 and (cid:2) 1769 . Incubation with AG490 in ESCC cells reduced the intracellular level of CTTN concomitantly with reduced p - STAT3 ( Tyr 705 ) . However , CRT protein level was not changed by AG490 treatment ( Figure 5c ) . Western immunoblot analysis indicated that CTTN expression was signiﬁcantly reduced in CRT – siRNA cells than in non - silencing siRNA and parental of ESCC cells ( Figure 5d ) . Forced transient expression of CRT in ESCC cells activates p - Stat3 on Tyr705 ( Figure 5e ) . Figure 4 CRT regulates cell motility and resistance to anoikis through CTTN in ESCC cells . ( a ) After 48h treatment by CRT – siRNA ( 40n M ) and non - silencing siRNA ( 40n M ) , CTTN expression in KYSE450 cells is found to be repressed .

CRT promotes motility and resistance to anoikis via CTTN X - L Du et al 3717 Oncogene Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was per - formed with two sets of primers that encompassed the three candidate STAT3 - binding sites indicated above , that is nucleotide residues (cid:2) 834 to (cid:2) 1044 ( (cid:2) 1003 site ) and (cid:2) 1574 to (cid:2) 1785 ( (cid:2) 1692 and (cid:2) 1769 sites ) upstream from the ATG translation initiation site ( Figure 5f ) . The results showed that the primers to the (cid:2) 1003 site could detect sequence of CTTN in chromatin immunoprecipi - tated with an anti - p - STAT3 ( Tyr 705 ) in ESCC cells . Importantly , the amount of CTTN promoter detected from CRT – siRNA cells was less than that from non - silencing siRNA and the parental counterparts ( Figure 5g ) . Activity of the reporter gene transfected with CTTN promoter fragment ( (cid:2) 1036 to (cid:2) 833 ) was signiﬁcantly higher than deletion of TTATGAAA ( (cid:2) 1003 to (cid:2) 996 ) in Hela cells ( Figure 5h ) . Discussion We previously reported that overexpression of CRT predicted a poor prognosis of ESCC patients . Recent studies have shown that overexpression of CRT correlated with postoperative appearance of metastases Figure 5 CRT regulates CTTN transcription through STAT3 . ( a and b ) Measurement of the mRNA level of CRT and CTTN in the CRT – siRNA , non - silencing siRNA and parental cells . RT – PCR was carried out using primers speciﬁc for human CRT , CTTN and GAPDH as shown in Materials and methods . Bands corresponding to CRT , CTTN and GAPDH were quantiﬁed by using GlykoBandScan version 4 . 3 software . Relative ratios of absorbance for CRT to GAPDH and CTTN to GAPDH were plotted . ( c ) For immunoblotting analysis of phosphorylated STAT3 , whole cell lysates were incubated in DMSO or AG490 ( 400 m M ) for 24h . ( d ) Western blot analysis shows that the phosphorylation of STAT3 ( Tyr705 ) is inhibited in ESCC cells with CRT repression . The levels of CRT , CTTN , total STAT3 and b - actin are conﬁrmed via immunoblotting analysis . ( e ) Forced transient expression of CRT in KYSE450 cells activates p - Stat3 on Tyr705 . ( f ) Bioinformatics analysis shows three consensus STAT3 - binding sequences at (cid:2) 1003 , (cid:2) 1692 and (cid:2) 1769 in the CTTN promoter region . ( g ) After cells were ﬁxed and sonicated , immunoprecipitated cellular DNA was extracted as described in Materials and methods , PCR was performed to amplify a 204 - bp product spanning the STAT3 - binding site ( (cid:2) 1003 to (cid:2) 996 ) in the CTTN promoter . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay detects less CTTN promoter from CRT – siRNA cells compared with non - silencing siRNA and the parental counterparts in KYSE450 cells . ( h ) Deletion of ‘TTATGAAA’ of the STAT3 - binding sites in the ‘ (cid:2) 1003 to (cid:2) 996’ of CTTN promoter region prevented STAT3 - mediated activation .

CRT promotes motility and resistance to anoikis via CTTN X - L Du et al 3718 Oncogene in breast cancer patients ( Eric et al . , 2009 ) . CRT is known to bind to the C - terminal cytoplasmic tail KXGFFKR sequence motif of a 2 - integrin . Overexpres - sion of CRT - enhanced wound closure by stimulating cell migration in human keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts ( Gold et al . , 2006 ) . In both murine - and porcine - impaired animal models of skin injury , CRT increased epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation ( Gold et al . , 2006 ; Hayashida et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , we showed that CRT knockdown decreased the migra - tion and invasion capacity of ESCC cells with accom - panying repression of CTTN protein levels . Forced expression of CTTN protein - enhanced cell migration in CRT – RNAi cells . It has been reported that the cellular role of CTTN is related to membrane dynamics and cortical actin assembly ( Lua and Low , 2005 ) . Previous results from this and other laboratories have revealed that CTTN promotes invasiveness of cancer cells in ESCC , breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ; Bourguignon et al . , 2001 ; Chuma et al . , 2004 ; Luo et al . , 2006 ; Rothschild et al . , 2006 ; Clark et al . , 2009 ) . CTTN regulates actin - based structures at the cell periphery through binding to Arp2 / 3 , WASP or WIP ( Kinley et al . , 2003 ) . Zhang et al . ( 2009 ) reported that deacetylation of CTTN promotes cell migration of breast and ovarian cancer . In this study , ﬂuorescently labeled phalloidin staining showed that the assembled F - actin decreased in CRT – siRNA cells as compared with non - silencing siRNA and parental ESCC cells . This ﬁnding suggests that downregulation of CRT decreases intracellular CTTN protein level and inhibits the polymerization of G - actin into F - actin in ESCC . Anoikis , apoptotic cell death due to loss of cell adhesion , is critical for regulation of tissue homeostasis in tissue remodeling , development , ﬁbrosis and tumor metastasis ( Valentijn et al . , 2004 ) . Here , we showed that decreased CRT was associated with increase of anoikis in ESCC cells . We postulate that CRT overexpression may help malignant cells survive in an anchorage - independent manner , leading to a poor prognosis of ESCC patients . Interestingly , we have previously found that CTTN was implicated in PI3K / Akt - mediated anoikis resistance and cell migration ( Luo et al . , 2006 ) . We therefore tested the hypothesis that CTTN may participate in CRT - associated signaling pathways . Our data shows that elevation of CTTN can recover the cellular resistance to anoikis in ESCC cells with CRT knockdown . Western immunoblot analysis showed that CRT repression indeed lowered CTTN expression , but that downregulation of CTTN did not alter CRT protein level , indicating that CRT acts upstream of CTTN . Furthermore , Akt activation was lowered after CRT suppression . In combination , these results suggest that CRT overexpression elevates the expression of CTTN protein , promotes activation of the PI3K / Akt pathway and ﬁnally increases resistance to anoikis in ESCC . It has recently been reported that CRT – LRP1 receptor complex has a critical role in thrombospondin 1 signaling to increase cell survival of ﬁbroblasts in anoikis by downregulating apoptotic signaling and stimulating Akt activity ( Pallero et al . , 2008 ) . However , in human glioblastoma U251MG cells , overexpression of CRT - enhanced radiation - induced apoptosis by sup - pressing Akt signaling ( Okunaga et al . , 2006 ) . Elevation of CRT promoted apoptosis during cardiac differentia - tion by negatively regulating Akt activation by upregu - lating the serine / threonine phosphatase PP2A ( Kageyama et al . , 2002 ) . In mature cardiomyocytes , enhanced CRT expression disrupted intracellular cal - cium regulation , leading to calcium - dependent apopto - sis ( Lim et al . , 2008 ) . These contradictory roles of CRT in modulating apoptosis could be explained as : cells derived from different tissues might have different genetic background ; different cell lines derived from the same type of tumors could have different signaling networks , which may result in a different response . To explore the possible mechanism of CRT regulating the expression of CTTN , we detect CTTN mRNA level in CRT – siRNA cells by RT – PCR , and found that CRT repression lowered CTTN mRNA expression . The evidence that CRT is involved in transcriptional regula - tion comes from the studies of glucocorticoid - , retinoic acid - , vitamin - D and steroid - sensitive induced gene expression ( Michalak et al . , 1996 ; Shago et al . , 1997 ; Rauch et al . , 2000 ) . As CRT itself is not a transcription factor , it is important to understand how CRT affects CTTN transcription . We postulate that repression of CRT may decrease the ability of other transcription factors to bind to the CTTN promoter . Several con - servative STAT3 binding sequences were identiﬁed in the region upstream of the CTTN promoter : ChIP and reporter assays conﬁrmed that p - STAT3 bound to the TTATGAAA sequence located in (cid:2) 1003 to (cid:2) 996 of CTTN promoter . Western immunoblot analysis indicated that downregulation of CRT inhibited Tyr - 705 phosphor - ylation of STAT3 . After treating ESCC cells with JAK inhibitor AG490 , we found that the expression of CTTN ( but not CRT ) was downregulated , further conﬁrming the regulatory role of STAT3 in CTTN transcription . These results suggest that CRT gene is an upstream regulator of STAT3 and that CRT promotes the transcription of CTTN by elevating the phosphorylation of STAT3 . The detailed mechanism of CRT regulation of the phosphor - ylation of STAT3 – CTTN will be further explored in our future studies . In conclusion , this study suggests that CRT repres - sion decreases the malignant phenotype of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo . Our results shed light on unreported functions of CRT in promoting migration / invasion and resistance to anoikis of ESCC cells . At the molecular level , CRT regulates CTTN transcription through enhancing the phosphorylation of STAT3 and therefore participates in PI3K / Akt pathway .

CRT – RNAi vector was obtained by introducing synthetic double - stranded oligonu - cleotides into the PGCsi . U6 . neo . GFP shRNA expression vector ( GeneChem ) . The CTTN promoter - luciferase plasmid ( pCTTN – Luc ) was constructed by inserting a human CTTN promoter fragment ( (cid:2) 1036 to (cid:2) 833 ) into the upstream region of the luciferase gene pGL3 ( Promega , San Luis Obispo , CA , USA ) . The deletion luciferase vector pCTTN – Mut – Luc was obtained by mutation deletion of TTATGAAA ( (cid:2) 1003 to (cid:2) 996 ) of pCTTN – Luc promoter . Cell culture , transfection and generation of CRT – RNAi esophageal cancer cells The human ESCC cell line EC9706 was established in our laboratory ( Huang et al . , 2002 ) . The human ESCC cell line KYSE450 was generously provided by Dr Y Shimada ( Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan ) . Cells were cultured in RPMI - 1640 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . Cell transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . In the stable transfection , CRT – RNAi pool clones of EC9706 cells were selected by their resistance to G - 418 Sulfate ( 200 m g / ml ) . In the transient transfection with chemically synthesized siRNA ( 40n M CRT – siRNA , 60 n M CTTN – siRNA or non - silencing siRNA ) and plasmids ( pcDNA 3 . 1a - CRT , pcDNA 3 . 1a - CTTN , pcDNA 3 . 1a ) were used , and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for the subsequent experiments .

Assessment of anoikis and treatment of inhibitor Cells were prevented from adhering to the plastic dishes by culturing them in dishes coated with PolyHEMA ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) as described previously ( Bourguignon et al . , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , culture of transient or stable - transfected cells was tripsinized and plated onto 6 - well polyHEMA plates ( polyHEMA plates were made by applying 1 . 5ml of 10 mg / ml solution of polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate in ethanol onto the plate , drying in tissue culture hood ) . After 24 h of growth in suspension , cells were harvested for apoptosis measurement using Annexin V – FITC detection kit ( Sigma ) . Cultured cells were serum starved for 24h and then treated by AG490 ( Calbiochem , Gibbstown , NJ , USA ) for 24 h at a ﬁnal concentration of 400 m M . Western immunoblot analysis Proteins were separated by SDS – PAGE , transferred to PVDF membranes ( Millipore , Temecula , CA , USA ) , blocked with milk / BSA , then probed with antibodies against either CTTN , Akt , p - Akt , Stat3 ( all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , p - Stat3 ( Tyr 705 ) ( Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA , USA ) , b - actin ( Sigma ) or CRT ( Stressgen , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) . After washing , the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using super ECL detection reagent ( Applygen , Beijing , China ) . F - actin staining Human ESCC cells ( KYSE450 ) were transiently transfected for 48h were plated on glass , washed twice in prewarmed PBS , ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 for 5min . The cells were subsequently stained by ﬂuorescently labeled phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) at a ﬁnal concentra - tion of 165n M in 1 % bovine PBS solution . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using a commercially available assay kit ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . The target protein p - STAT3 was immunoprecipitated with either 2 m g of anti - p - STAT3 ( Tyr 705 ) polyclonal antibody or 2 m g of rabbit IgG as a negative control . The following PCR primers were employed to amplify the 204 - bp product spanning the STAT3 - speciﬁc binding site ( (cid:2) 1003 ) identiﬁed in the 5 0 - ﬂanking region of the human CRT gene : forward , 5 0 - GG GTTCAGGTCCTACCGTCTCC - 3 0 ; reverse , 5 0 - CGTCCTC GTCCGCTCACCAT - 3 0 , and 213 - bp product spanning the STAT3 - speciﬁc binding site ( (cid:2) 1769 and (cid:2) 1692 ) forward , 5 0 - TG TATGAAGGTCATGATTTTACC - 3 0 , reverse 5 0 - TGGAA GATGGATGGGAGA - 3 0 . Transfection and luciferase assay Human Hela cells were transiently transfected by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen ) with a total of 0 . 3 m g of luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 - Basic and different expression plasmids ( pCTTN – Luc and pCTTN – Mut – Luc ) . To correct for variations in transfection efﬁciency , 0 . 04 ng of pRL – SV40 vector encoding the Renilla luciferase gene behind a cytomegalovirus promoter ( Promega ) was co - transfected in each experiment . After 24 h of transfection , cell lysates were prepared , both ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luciferase activities were quantiﬁed using the dual - luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Colony formation and xenograft assays in nude mice Colony formation assay in soft agar was based on a modiﬁed method ( Li et al . , 2001 ) . CRT – RNAi , scramble RNAi and parental EC9706 cells were plated in 6 - well plates at a density of 500 cells per well . For each clone , three independent wells were examined . After 3 weeks of incubation at 37 1 C and 5 % CO 2 , colonies were stained with 0 . 2 % p - iodonitrotetrazolium violet ( Sigma ) and counted . EC9706 , control RNAi and CRT – RNAi cells were collected for xenograft assay as previously described ( Li et al . , 2001 ; Luo et al . , 2006 ; Rothschild et al . , 2006 ) . Six female nude mice ( Vital River , Beijing , China ) for each group were s . c . injected with 1 (cid:3) 10 6 cells per animal . The mice were killed 4 weeks after injection and examined for s . c . tumor growth . Each experiment was repeated with two independent groups of six mice . Immunohistochemistry was carried out on the 5 m m sections of parafﬁn - embedded mice tumors . The slides CRT promotes motility and resistance to anoikis via CTTN X - L Du et al 3720 Oncogene were deparafﬁnized , rehydrated and dripped in 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution for 10min , heated in citrate buffer at pH 6 . 0 and 95 1 C for 25min , cooled at room temperature , blocked by normal goat serum at 37 1 C for 30min and then incubated with anti - CRT or anti - CTTN antibody at 37 1 C for 2h . After washing with PBS , the slides were incubated with biotinylated second antibody at 37 1 C for 30min followed by streptavidin – peroxidase . The development of the slides was carried out using diaminobenzidin solution . Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using Student’s t - test with SPSS13 . 0 Statistical program for Windows . P - value of less than 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant .
