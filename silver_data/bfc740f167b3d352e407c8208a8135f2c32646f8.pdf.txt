Bone is a composite organ that fulﬁls several interconnected functions , which may conﬂict with each other in pathological conditions . Bone vascularization is at the interface between these functions . The roles of bone vascularization are better documented in bone development , growth and modeling than in bone remodeling . However , every bone remodeling unit is associated with a capillary in both cortical and trabecular envelopes . Here we summarize the most recent data on vessel involvement in bone remodeling , and we present the characteristics of bone vascularization . Finally , we describe the various techniques used for bone vessel imaging and quantitative assessment , including histology , immunohistochemistry , microtomography and intravital microscopy .

Moreover , bone is a feedback controlled composite organ that fulﬁls several interconnected functions including locomotion , involvement in phosphate and calcium metabolism , synthesis of endocrine molecules and hematopoiesis , which may conﬂict with each other in pathological conditions . Bone vascularization is at the interface between these functions . As for other organs , blood ﬂowwithin abone istightly correlated with itsmetabolic activity : by controlling oxygen and nutrient delivery , bone vessels become a limiting factor , which may alter the various phy - siological functions of bone and could potentially modulate treatment efﬁcacy in metabolic bone diseases . Hemody - namics , oxygen consumption and energetic metabolism are intimately coupled with the activities of bone formation and resorption during bone modeling and remodeling . The roles of vessels have been well documented in various bone modeling situations . Blood vascular penetration into the avascular car - tilage template is a landmark of the early steps of endochondral ossiﬁcation , and the invasion by blood vessels of the growth plate hypertrophic zone is an essential event for bone elon - gation . 1 The development of a new vascular network is a critical step in wound healing and represents a primary limiting factor in functional tissue regeneration . 2 Overall , bone modeling is characterized by a tightly regulated positive coupling between osteogenesis and angiogenesis . Therefore , bone vascular - ization has become arelevant therapeutic target inboth ﬁelds of fracture repair 3 and bone tissue engineering . 4 In contrast , the relationships between vessels and bone remodeling remain poorly understood . In this review , we summarize the current knowledge on the role of vessels in bone remodeling and brieﬂy describe the various techniques available for bone vessel identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation . The methods for assessment of bone blood perfusion are beyond the scope of this review . The Role of Vessels in Bone Remodeling Within cortices , the remodeling cutting and closing cones , which build secondary osteons , are centered by a vessel ( Figure 1 ; bottom ) . It is necessary to stress that mice and rats lackawell - developedHaversianremodelingsystemandmostly lose cortical bone at the endosteum , in contrast to larger mammals whose increased Haversian remodeling is a major causeofcorticalporosityandage - relatedboneloss . Inhumans , Haversian vascular canals are roughly parallel to the diaphysis axis and highly connected at right angle to ‘Volkman’ canals . In the mouse , canals exhibit a radial pattern and are poorly branched ( as shown by Schneider et al . 5 ) , whereas in the rat , they are more interconnected and oriented like in humans ( Figure 2 ) 6 . Thus , the organization of cortical vascularization in long bones strongly differs among species . As a result , the role Correspondence : Professor M - H Lafage - Proust , Laboratoire de Biologie Inte´gre´e du Tissu Osseux , INSERM U 1059 , Saint - Etienne 42023 , France .

In contrast to cortical bone , diagrams illustrating trabecular bone remodeling drawn 20 years ago constantly lacked the bone vessel . However , those designed more recently repeatedly show a capillary close to the remodeling unit ( http : / / stemcells . nih . gov / info / 2006report / chapter11 . htm ) . Indeed , there is accumulating evidence that the bone vasculature is a crucial partner in the bone remodeling process and has a role in the resorption / formation coupling . Bone vessels bring osteo - clast precursors at the bone surface where remodeling is about to take place and ‘feed’ the remodeling unit with new cells as long as necessary ( Figure 1 ) . As for the osteoblastic lineage , studies suggest that osteoprogenitors could be recruited from circulating cells , 7 differentiated from pericytes , 8 , 9 or from cells located in the canopy 10 that isolate the bone remodeling compartment from the bone marrow 11 , 12 ( Figure 1 ; top ) . Interestingly , canopy cells are in close contact with capillaries and Delaisse´’s team recently demonstrated that vessel posi - tioning relative to the bone surface was highly dependent on the remodeling status of the bone remodeling compartment , 13 suggestingsubstantial vesselplasticity . Thecomplexmolecular crosstalk between bone and vascular cells ( reviewed in reference 14 ) is progressively unraveled and includes the cues involved in angiogenesis , such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 15 or preosteoclasts / preosteoblasts homing , such as Sphingosine - phosphate 1 concentrations 16 or CXCR4 / CXCL12 signaling , 17 , 18 which control cell trafﬁcking through the vascular wall . Recently , Kusumbe et al . 19 described two subtypes of bone vessels according to their high ( H ) or low ( L ) level of CD31 and endomucin expression . In young animals , H vessels contain more proliferating endothelial cells . They are abundant in the primary spongiosa and run along the cortical endosteum . H vessels are more surrounded with osteoprogenitors , express higher levels of HIF - 1 a but are less numerous than L - type vessels . Most interestingly , inhibition or activation of the HIF - 1 a signaling pathway in endothelial cells only modulates bone mass and perivascular osteoprogenitor number . Genetic lineage tracing showed that H endothelial cells mediate neoangiogenesis in bone . The amount of H endothelial cells declines with age in the bone marrow , whereas that of total endothelial cells does not . Deferoxamin treatment , which stabilizes HIF - 1 a , was osteogenic and led to substantial expansion of type H endothelium and emergence of vessel - associated osteoprogenitors in aged animals . Xie et al . 20 further showed that platelet - derived growth factor - BB , exogenous or released by preosteoclasts , induces type H vessel and sti - mulates bone formation in OVX mice . Altogether , these exciting data emphasize the high heterogeneity of bone vasculature and clearly identify the bone vessel as a therapeutic target in metabolic bone diseases . However , the kinetics of vessel behavior during the whole remodeling process ( activation , Figure 1 Illustration of spatial and functional relationships between blood capillary and the bone remodeling compartment in trabecular ( top ) and cortical envelopes ( bottom ) .

Bone vascularization M - H Lafage - Proust et al 2 APRIL 2015 | www . nature . com / bonekey resorption , formation and quiescence , cf Figure 1 ) and the precise molecular mechanisms that control it remain unknown . Involvement of Bone Vasculature in Metabolic Bone Diseases : Clinical Perspectives Certainly , the abundant literature showing strong associations between osteoporosis and atherosclerosis or vascular calciﬁcations led to the concept of the ‘bone – vascular axis’ suggesting common pathophysiological links between skeletal and vessel diseases , 21 especially in the ageing context . However , a limited number of studies speciﬁcally analyzed the connections between bone vascularization or perfusion and metabolic bone diseases in humans . Burkhardt et al . 22 found on histological sections that bone marrow vessels became increasingly scarce with age .

Bone vascularization M - H Lafage - Proust et al BoneKEy Reports | APRIL 2015 3 ﬁndings , Wang and colleagues , using magnetic resonance imaging , reported a reduction in bone perfusion in post - menopausal osteoporotic women , as compared with age - matched healthy controls , 23 whereas a decrease in bone vascular density was observed in ovariectomized rodents . 24 , 25 Jumping to simplistic conclusions , one could think that ‘the morevessels / perfusion , thebetterforbone’ . However , although overexpressionofvascularendothelialgrowthfactorreceptorinthechondro - osteoblast lineage in adult mice is angiogenic and increases trabecular bone mass , it also induces ﬁbrotic marrow and cortical porosity , reminiscent of what is observed in secondary hyperparathyroidism . 1 Some non - malignant bone diseases are associated with complex vascular anomalies . Paget’s disease and reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy at its early stage 26 both feature a signiﬁcant increase in bone blood ﬂow and accelerated resorption ; however , the former leads to bigger bones , whereas the latter is associated with bone loss . These caricatural examples somehow emphasize the fact that the functional relationships between bone remodeling and vessels may not be as straightforward as previously thought . Morphological and Functional Heterogeneity of Bone Vessels Bone is highly vascularized . Sub - periosteal and bone marrow vessels are connected via the cortical vascular network . Bone marrowvesselsareheterogeneous andinclude small ) classic * capillaries ( o 10 – 15 m m ) and a majority of sinusoid capillaries ( 20 – 30 m m ) , which belong to the venous capillary system . It is noteworthy that there is no lymphatic vessel in the normal bone marrow , whereas sub - periosteal lymphatic vessels run along the outer surface of the cortical bone . 27 Both classic capillary and sinusoid networks are linked by transitional vessels , which share some features of the vessels they connect to . 28 The basal membrane of sinusoids is absent or discontinuous . Their wall is perforated by inter - and intra - endothelial pores through which maturehematopoieticcellstrafﬁctowardsthebloodcirculation , whereas intravascular soluble and relatively large molecules can be rapidly extravasated . 29 Endothelialcellssharebasalmembranewithpericytes , which are borne by the vessel wall . The pericyte vessel wall coverage is variable according to the type of vascular bed . Sixty - ﬁve percent and71 % of theadventitial sinusoid surfacearecovered by pericytes in the bone marrow of the rat 30 and the mouse , 31 respectively , this percentage being potentially reduced when egress of hematopoietic cells increases . In healthy humans older than 50 years , an average of 51 % ( ± 20 % ) of the bone marrow microvessels were reported to be covered by pericytes . 29 Sinusoids and classic capillaries networks differ in terms of spatial organization . The sinusoid network is denser , isotropic and organized in a mesh - like structure , whereas the capillary bed has a tree - like shape . Finally , direct measurements at the endosteumoftherabbitﬁbulahaveshownthatsinusoidalblood ﬂow is only one - tenth of that in capillaries . 32 Expectedly , numerous sinusoids irrigate the ‘red’ hematopoietic marrow , whereas scarce classic capillaries are observed in the ‘yellow’ fatty marrow . 33 – 35 Using standard histological staining pro - cedures of iliac crest biopsies from normal human subjects , Burkhardt et al . reported that the age - associated reduction in the capillary and sinusoid beds correlated with the overall increase in bone marrow fat volume . 20 In contrast , in the lower third of the diaphysis of rodents , a region ﬁlled with marrow adipocytes , we counted 4 100 vessels per mm 2 , whereas there were 60 – 65 vessels per mm 2 in the metaphysis where the marrow is essentially hematopoietic . 36 These discrepancies underline that the relationships between bone adipocytes and vessels are complex , which may be related to the various subtypes of fat cells found in the marrow . 37 We do not know whether there are variations in the vascular network structure or morphology throughout the skeleton in humans . In 4 - month - old mice , we counted similar number of barium - infused microvessels in tibia and femur , 38 and , in younger mice , Lassailly et al . 39 did not ﬁnd any difference in bone vessel densities between calvaria and long bones . Furthermore , these authors studied perfusion efﬁciency assessed after Ho 33342 dye perfusion followed by analysis of the bone marrow cell dye uptake . There was no difference in overall perfusion efﬁciency between long bone diaphyses , epiphyses and calvaria . However , truly hypoxic cells ( as measured by pimonidazole staining that identiﬁes cells exposed to oxygen partial pressure ( PO 2 ) o 10mmHg ) were less frequent within calvaria as compared with long bones . Thus , although the bone marrow is highly vascularized , its perfusion is heterogeneous , some regions being poorly perfused and hypoxic , regardless of the type of bone . Recently , Spencer et al . were able to perform in vivo measurements of PO 2 using two - photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy in mice . They found a PO 2 decreasing gradient from the periosteum ( 50mm Hg ) to the extravascular bone marrow compartment , with PO 2 as low as 9 . 9 mmHg in this latter area . However , the peri - endosteal region ( zone located at 0 – 20 m m from the bone surface ) in which the smallest vessels were observed exhibited intermediate values ( 21 . 9 mmHg in the vessels and 13 . 5 mm Hg outside the vessels ) . 40 A growing numberofreportssuggestedacriticalroleoflocalhypoxiainthehematopoieticnicherelatedtothestemnessmaintenanceofthehematopoieticstemcells . These data emphasize the fact that vessel count cannot be a surrogate marker of blood supply or perfusion in bone and that the combination of morphological and functional analyses are necessary to better understand the bone / vessel relationship . Methods for Assessment of Bone Vascularization Assessment of bone vascularization requires visualization and identiﬁcation of the vascular structures before their quantiﬁcation . It consists in either labeling the vessel wall or ﬁlling the vascular network with a contrast product . Vessel Wall Labeling Vessel wall labeling can be performed via the use of reporter genes driven by endothelial - speciﬁc promoter , immuno - histochemistry or intravenous injection of molecules captured by endothelial cells . Tie2 26 or VE Cadherin ( also called Cadherin 5 ) 41 promoters may be employed in the mouse , considering that the Tie2 promoter is activated in classic capillaries and not in sinusoids . 26 Immunohistochemistry targets either endothelial cells ( summarized in Table 1 ) or smooth muscle cells ( anti - smooth muscle alpha - actin anti - bodies ) . In addition , functional properties of endothelial cells may be exploited for capillary detection such as endocytosis of Bone vascularization M - H Lafage - Proust et al 4 APRIL 2015 | www . nature . com / bonekey ﬂuorescent acetylated low - density lipoprotein ( Dil - Ac - LDL ) 26 or isolectin binding . 26 Li et al . combined the analysis of green ﬂuorescent protein - Tie2 expressing capillaries and Dil - Ac - LDL endocytosis ( sinusoids ) to characterize the bone marrow vascular bed . They described ‘transitional’ microvessels interfacing and connected to the sinusoid and capillary net - works whose speciﬁc function remains unknown . Wang et al . demonstrated that endomucin antibody speciﬁcally stains sinusoids as compared with the non - speciﬁc expression of VE Cadherin . 39 The pericytes can be identiﬁed with anti - platelet - derived growth factor receptor b , desmin or neuro - glial antigen 2 antibodies . 42 In addition , a growing body of studies reports expression of a various number of proteins ( such as nestin , 43 leptin receptor 44 in mice or CD146 19 in humans ) by sub - populations of pericytes , which are involved in the hemato - poietic niche . Most of the studies use 5 - m m - thick cryosections and immu - noﬂuorescence , although some authors utilize decalciﬁed par - afﬁn - embedded samples with terriﬁc results . 11 , 13 Recently , Adams’ team published outstanding low magniﬁcation images of immunoﬂuorescence - labeled vessels on 300 - m m - thick frozen decalciﬁedmousewholetibiasections . 45 Finally , itisalsopossible to perform in vivo vessel labeling by intravascular injection of antibodies 46 or isolectin , 37 followed by in vivo or ex vivo confocal / multiphoton microscopy . After immunological staining , vessel quantiﬁcation may be automated , sometimes preceded by manual tracking , provided that labeling is clean enough . 47 Filling the Vascular Network with Contrast Product Injection of ﬂuorescent molecules and intravital microscopy . Branemark was the ﬁrst to perform intravital microscopy of bone vascularization by observing under a microscope a trans - illuminated rabbit ﬁbula . 48 The use of ﬂuorescent probe intravenous injection combined with intravital microscopy of mouse calvaria was introduced by Von Andrian’s team . 49 Two - photon ﬂuorescence can be collected through the bone cortex via a confocal microscope as long as that the cortex is ﬂat and thin enough , which makes mouse calvaria the best candidate for this imaging technique . After mouse anesthesia , ﬂuorescent tracers ( Rhodamine / ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - labeled dextran or smaller particles such as quantum dots ) are injected into the blood circulation followed by observation under the confocal microscope . Under two - photon excitation , type 1 collagen is easily identiﬁed via second harmonics generation ( Figure 2g – i ) . Using this technique , Lo Celso et al . 50 quantiﬁed the spatial relationships between bone marrow vessels , hematopoietic stem cells and green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - runx 2 - positive osteoblastic cells . Some authors insert a glass window in rodent femur after perforating the cortex , which allows longitudinal survey of bone vessels with time - lapsed imaging . Using this technique , trafﬁcking of GFP - labeled preosteoclasts through the capillary walls could be markedly observed . 16 Grinding tibia cortex down to a 100 m m thickness permits to image the tibia marrow cavity 51 ( Figure 2g – i ) . Radio - opaque contrast product , histology and microtomography imaging Choice of the contrast product . Pioneer anatomists and surgeons 52 – 54 used infusion of gelatin - india ink as a contrast product , followed by visualization of bone vessels on whole mounts or histological sections . This technique is still used for the analysis of cortical vessels in animal models . 55 Lateron , vascularcorrosioncastswereobtainedafterinfusion and polymerization of methylmethacrylate resin followed by bone matrix digestion and scanning electron microscopy imaging . Beside resin , rubber such as latex can be infused ; however , itsmolecular sizeandviscosity limitits penetrationinto the ﬁne branches of the vascular network and only the primary arteries and a few of the larger secondary arterioles may be injected , 56 restricting its use to anatomy studies . This infusion technique can be used in human cadavers , rodents 57 or bigger animal models . Radio - opaque compounds such as barium sulfate or , more recently , lead chromate - loaded silicon ( Microﬁl , Flow Tech , Inc . , Carver , MA , USA ) were used . They allow both histology and X - ray - based imaging including microtomography Table 1 Main endothelial markers used for identiﬁcation of microvessels in the bone marrow of mice , rabbit and humans .

Microﬁl is suitable to image vessels outside the bone , 58 within muscles , as well as in soft organs . In contrast , we demonstratedthatabariumsulfatesolution ( withbariumparticle size of 1 – 2 m m , Micropaque , Guerbet , Roissy , France ) is a better tool for bone vessel visualization within trabecular bone in rodents , because it fully penetrates the marrow vessels including the smallest ones and it does not shrink after resin embedding 34 ( Figure 2 ) as Microﬁl does . Indeed , most of the publications usingMicroﬁlopaciﬁcationofbonemarrowvessels show few ball - shaped vessels and discontinuous vascular networks . 59 , 60 In cortical bone , the vessels were reproducibly ﬁlled with barium in rats 61 ( Figure 2d – f ) but not in mice 34 ( Figure 2b ) , probably because of inadequate rheology / output of the barium solution for infusion of mouse cortical vessels . In line with our results , Schneider et al . 62 quantiﬁed the cortical canal network before and after barium infusion and found that the volume of the vascular network was much smaller than that of the cortical porosity . Microtomography imaging . Duvall et al . 63 thoroughly described the algorithms for m CT imaging of the vascular network in the rat hindlimb ischemic model and illustrated the inﬂuence of threshold levels on results . Using a similar approach with Scanco m CT devices ( VivaCT and m CT40 Scanco Medical AG , Basserdorf , Switzerland ) , we analyzed the inﬂuence of both spatial resolution and threshold on trabecular bone vascular - ization in barium sulfate - infused rat tibiae after decalciﬁcation and found signiﬁcant positive correlations between histology and m CTresults . 64 Synchrotron radiation m CT imaging provided better spatial resolution compared with conventional m CT and did not require sample decalciﬁcation , thus allowing to visualize vessels in three - dimensions and analyze their location in relation to the bone surfaces . 61 Using an IMAGEJ - based software , wecompleted our analysison histological sections by measuring the mean distance between vessels and the bone - forming surfaces ( identiﬁed by the presence of osteoid ) according to the vessel size . With these speciﬁc tools , we showed that intermittent PTH 1 - 84 was osteogenic but not angiogenic and relocated the smallest vessels closer to the bone - forming sites , in rats . 65 In mice , conventional m CTwith 10 - m m 3 voxel size is not suitable for bone vascular imaging even after sample decalciﬁcation . 34 As expected , 1 . 5 - m m - thick slices obtained with synchrotron radiation m CT provided excellent contrast between vessels and trabeculae as did conventional m CT ( Scanco m CT50 and GE nanoCT ) with a 3 - m m resolution ( Figure 2 ) . As said above , we were not able to fully infuse the cortical vascular network with barium sulfate solution in mice ( as seen in Figure 2 ) . Yet , it is possible , using m CT , to image the cortical porosity to assess the vascular cortical network , provided that the resolution is high enough . 66 Bone Vascular Quantitative Assessment Bone vessel quantiﬁcation has been performed on three - dimensional m CT data sets from barium or Microﬁl - infused bones . Most of the teams use the software developed for measurements of trabecular bone , which generates para - meters such as vascular volume per tissue volume ( % ) , mean vessel thickness ( m m ) or separation and vessel number ( / mm ) . Expectedly , numerical results depend on the quality of the image , which itself is contingent upon infusion conditions , leading to high variability of mouse bone marrow vessel densities among the studies . Vessel quantiﬁcation can also be performed on histology or m CT images of immunohis - tochemistry stained or barium - ﬁlled vessels , respectively , by means of manual count ( grid ) 34 or semi - automatic 60 image analysis . Vascular volume per tissue volume ( VV / TV , % ) or per marrow volume ( VV / Mar V , % ) and mean vessel number per mm 2 of bone marrow area ( V Nb / Mar Ar ) are measured , and the mean vessel area ( m m 2 ) is calculated by dividing the total vessel area ( in m m 2 ) by vessel number . 34 , 67 Unfortunately , in contrast to the ﬁeld of malignant diseases associated with bone marrow angiogenesis , 68 there is no methodological consensus on the parameter nomenclature and regions of interest for the quantiﬁcation of bone marrow vessels . This leads to a pro - nounced heterogeneity of the results among the various publications . As an example , the vascular density in C57BL / 6 mouse tibia or femur varies from 40 69 to 280 70 vessels per mm 2 of bone marrow with CD31 antibodies , from 20 71 to 150 72 per mm 2 with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 anti - bodies , and was found as low as 10 per mm 2 with anti - CD34 antibodiesin6 - month - oldmice . 73 Furthermore , wewereable to show that , beside differences in vessel count due to metho - dology , mouse genetic background , age and sex modulate the bone marrow vessel density . 34 These discrepancies may not inﬂuence the interpretation of the results within one study but make comparisons between studies difﬁcult . On the basis of synchrotron radiation m CT images of cortical bone , Schneider et al . 74 reported mouse strain and sex - related differences in vascular channel structure and density . In human bone , Cooper et al . 75 , using skeletonization techniques were able to image and quantify the density and connectivity of the cortical ‘vascular’ porosity . Their work suggests that three - dimensional morphologic analysis of the canal network may provide novel insights into bone physiology that are not possible with two - dimensional approaches . Thus , intra - cortical porosity could serve as a surrogate parameter for assessing vascular density in this envelope . In contrast , measurement of vascular volume with this technique might be less accurate , the pore size beinghighlydependentontheresorptionandformationperiods . Conclusion Blood vessels exhibit tight structural and functional relation - ships with bone cells , which are not fully understood . A better understanding of vessel function improved the management of various diseases , which affect the kidney , heart or brain . Thus , studying the roles of vascularization in bone by the means of adequate tools and reproducible techniques should provide similar beneﬁts for the comprehension and treatment of metabolic bone diseases . 76 – 78 Conﬂict of Interest The authors declare no conﬂict of interest .
