We studied the cell - surface delivery path - ways of newly synthesized membrane glycoproteins in MDCK cells and for this purpose we characterized an endogenous apical integral membrane glycoprotein . By combining a pulse - chase protocol with domain - selective cell - surface biotinylation , immune precipita - tion , and streptavidin - agarose precipitation ( Le Bivic et al . 1989 . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci USA . 86 : 9313 - 9317 ) , we followed the appearance at the cell surface of a major apical sialoglycoprotein , gpll4 , a baso - lateral protein , uvomorulin , and a transcytosing pro - tein , the polyimmunoglobulin receptor ( pig - R ) . We determined that both gp114 and uvomorulin appeared to be delivered directly to their respective surface , with mistargeting levels of 8 and 2 % , respectively . Using the same technique , the plg - R was first detected on the basolateral domain and then on the apical do - main , to be finally released into the apical medium , as described ( Mostov , K . E . , and D . L . Deitcher . 1986 . Cell . 46 : 613 - 621 ) . To directly determine whether the gp114 pool present on the basolateral surface was a precursor of the apical gp114 , we compared it with the equivalent plg - R pool , by labeling with sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin , a cleavable , tight junction - impermeable probe , and by following the fraction of this probe that be - came resistant to basal glutathione and accessible to apical glutathione during incubation at 37°C . We found that , contrary to pig - R , basolateral gp114 was poorly endocytosed and was not transcytosed to the apical side . These results demonstrate that an endoge - nous apical integral membrane glycoprotein of Madin - Darby canine kidney cells is sorted intracellu - larly and is vectorially targeted to the apical surface . M DCK cells have been extensively used to study the bio - genesis of epithelial cell polarity ( 6 , 18 , 26a , 31 ) . Studies on the sorting of plasma membrane pro - teins were initially carried out with MDCK cells infected with enveloped RNA viruses , such as influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus , which bud , respectively , from the apical or the basolateral domains of the plasma membrane ( 27 ) . Pola - rized viral budding is preceded by segregation of the main envelope glycoproteins , i . e . , influenza HA and vesicular sto - matitis virus G protein into the budding domain ( 26 ) . Fur - thermore , when these proteins were expressed in MDCK cells from transfected cDNAs they displayed a similar pola - rized distribution to that observed in infected cells ( 11 , 28 ) . Taking advantage of these powerful viral tools , several stud - ies established that , in MDCK cells , the polarized distribu - tion of viral envelope glycoproteins is determined by intra - cellular sorting at the level of the trans - Golgi network and vectorial delivery to the respective surface ( 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 ) . Because of their lower biosynthetic rates , and the corre - sponding need for higher sensitivity methods , studies on the targeting of endogenous MDCK glycoproteins have lagged behind those on viral glycoproteins . Only one paper has ap - peared , by Caplan et al . ( 1986 ) , reporting the direct delivery of a basolateral membrane pump , the Na÷ , K ÷ ATPase , to the basolateral surface [ 7 ] . The need for additional studies on the pathways of apical glyeoproteins in MDCK cells is stressed by observations in native intestinal and liver epithe - lia , which suggest an indirect pathway for apical membrane proteins : delivery to the basolateral domain followed by relocation to the apical domain ( 2 , 13 , 17 ) . Largely , most studies available in both MDCK and native epithelial cells base their conclusion on vectorial versus transcytotic targeting on the " kinetics " of the appearance of the proteins at both surfaces , but not on the direct analysis of the fate of the protein pool present in the " incorrect " sur - face . In this report , we apply to MDCK cells three experi - mental strategies that we recently introduced to study the targeting of apical and basolateral integral membrane glyco - proteins in a human intestinal cell line ( 15 ) . The first one is analogous to the approach used by Lisanti et al . ( 16 ) ( pulse - chase and domain - selective biotinylation ) , except that the proteins were precipitated with specific antibodies ( instead of lectins ) to highly increase the sensitivity of the method . The second one involves a procedure to directly observe the fate of the basolateral pool of apical antigens ; this method involves labeling with a cleavable biotin analog to measure their endocytotic and transcytotic rates ( 15 ) . Finally , the pathways of the endogenous antigens are compared with that © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 90 / 05 / 1533 / 7 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 110 , May 1990 1533 - 1539 1533 on A ugu s t 16 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m of exogenous polyimmunoglobulin receptor ( pig - R ) ~ , which includes a basolateral stage in its complex route to the apical surface and therefore constitutes an ideal positive control ( 21 ) . Our results conclusively demonstrate direct targeting of an apical integral membrane glycoprotein and a basolat - eral cell adhesion molecule ( uvomorulin ) to their respective surface in MDCK cells . Materials and Methods Reagents Cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco Laboratories ( Grand Is - land , NY ) . Affinity - purified antibodies , rabbit anti - mouse IgG , rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG and goat anti - guinea pig IgG were pur - chased from Cappel Laboratories ( Westchester , PA ) . Protein A - Sepharose was from Pharmacia ( Uppsala , Sweden ) , sulfo - N - hydroxy - succinimido - biotin ( s - NHS - biotin ) , sulfosuccinimidyl 2 - ( biotinamido ) ethyl 1 , 3 - dithio - propionate ( s - NHS - SS - biotin ) , and streptavidin - agarose beads were from Pierce Chemical Co . ( Rockford , IL ) . All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cells , Antibodies , and Cell Culture MDCK type II were grown in DME supplemented with 10 % horse serum . MDCK cells expressing the eDNA for the plg - R have been described previ - ously ( 21 ) and were grown in DME supplemented with 5 % FBS . Guinea pig antiserum for the plg - R has been described elsewhere ( 4 ) . mAb against uvomorulin was a generous gift from Dr . B . Gumbiner ( University of Cali - fornia at San Francisco ) ( 12 ) . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gpll4 were obtained by purification of this protein from apical membrane prepara - tions ( 29 ) by wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) - Sepharose affinity chromatog - raphy ( 22 ) and separation on SDS - PAGE ( 14 ) . After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose paper ( 33 ) , the band was visualized by Ponceau red , cut out , and injected into New Zealand rabbits for immunization ( 10 ) . For ex - periments , cells were grown on Transwells ( Costar Data Packaging Corp . , Cambridge , MA ) and used after 7 d . Biotinylation Biotinylation of monolayers on Transwells with s - NHS - biotin ( 30 ) was car - ried out twice in a row for 20 rain at 4°C with 0 . 5 ml for the apical chamber and 1 . 5 ml for the basolateral chamber . Free biotin was blocked with 50 mM NH4CI in PBS containing 1 mM MgCI2 and 0 . 1 mM CaCI2 . Biotin - ylation with s - NHS - SS - biotin was performed as for s - NHS - biotin . After bi - otinylation , reduction of surface s - NHS - SS - biotin was performed with 50 mM glutathione for 30 min ( 15 ) in 90 mM NaCI , 1 mM MgCI2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCI2 , 60 mM NaOH , and 10 % FBS . Pulse - Chase Experiments Cells grown on filters were incubated for 30 min in DME without methio - nine / cysteine , and pulsed for 20 min in the same medium containing 0 . 8 mCi / ml trany ~ 5 label ( ICN K & K Laboratories Inc . , Plainview , NY ) and 0 . 4 mCi / ml 35S cysteine ( NEN , Chadds Ford , PA ) as described ( 21 ) . Cells were washed once with DME , chased in DME containing 10x cysteine / me - thionine , and stored at 4°C in NaCO3H - free DME , 20 mM Hepes , and 0 . 2 % BSA before biotinylation . lmmunoprecipitation and Streptavidin Precipitation After biotinylation , filters were excised and cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer : 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - lO0 , 0 . 2 % BSA , and protease inhibitors for 1 h under agitation . Extracts were precleared by addition of 100 / ~ 1 of a Staphylococcus aureus slurry ( fixed bacteria , 50 % vol / vol , prewashed three times ) ( Pansorbin ; Calbio - chem - Behring Corp . , San Diego , CA ) for 20 min and centrifuged at 15 , 000 g for 10 rain . Supernatants were incubated for 12 h with protein A - Sepharose ( 10 mg / ml ) precoated with rabbit anti - mouse Ig plus mAbs ( diluted 1 / 100 for ascites ) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( I / 250 ) for gp114 or guinea pig 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : pig - R , polyimmunoglobulin receptor ; WGA , wheat germ agglutinin . polyclonal antibodies ( 1 / 4 , 000 ) for plg - R . After incubation , the beads were washed as described ( 15 ) . To recover the immunoprecipitated biotinylated antigens , the beads were boiled with 10 / ~ 1 of 10 % SDS for 5 min , diluted with lysis buffer ( 500 ~ , l / tube ) , and centrifuged ( 1 min at 15 , 000 g ) . Super - natants were incubated overnight with streptavidin - agarose beads ( 50 t ~ l , 50 % slurry ) . Finally , the beads were washed ( 15 ) and boiled in gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE 6 / 16 % ( 14 ) . Dried gels were processed for fluorography as described ( 8 ) using preflashed films . Densitometric analysis was performed under conditions where linearity was best preserved using a scanning densitometer ( model GS 300 ; Hoefer Scientific Instru - ments , San Francisco , CA ) ; at least t ~ independent experiments were per - formed . Alternatively , immunoprecipitated antigens from biotinylated cells were directly analyzed by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions for s - NHS - biotin or nonreducing conditions for s - NHS - SS - biotin , and blotted with ~ 2Sl - streptavidin on nitrocellulose ( 30 ) . Frozen Sections 0 . 5 - t ~ m frozen sections of MDCK cells on collagen ( 32 ) were processed for immunofluorescence as described ( 15 ) . Results Characterization of the Surface Distribution of Two Endogenous and One Exogenous Integral Membrane Glycoproteins of MDCK Cells In a previous study ( 29 ) , two major sialoglycoproteins ( ap - proximate molecular mass 100 and 200 kD ) were detected in isolated apical membrane fractions of MDCK cells by ~ 2q - WGA blotting . The lowest molecular weight band was unextractable with carbonate buffer ( 29 ) and partitioned with the detergent phase of Triton X - 114 ( 16 ) , which indi - cated that it is an integral membrane protein . This protein was purified from isolated apical membranes of MDCK cells by affinity chromatography on a WGA - Sepharose column ( 22 ) and used to prepare polyclonal antibodies . Using this antibody on semi - thin frozen sections of MDCK cells the an - tigen was localized at the apical surface ( Fig . 1 , a and b ) . In contrast , an mAb against the cell adhesion molecule uvo - morulin labeled mainly the lateral membrane of the cells ( Fig . l , c and d ) . Immunoprecipitation from cells labeled with s - NHS - biotin revealed only a 114 - kD protein ( gpll4 ) ; in filter - grown monolayers , 95 % of gpll4 was labeled from the apical side ( Fig . 2 ) , confirming its apical localization . Under identical conditions , uvomorulin was preferentially labeled ( 96 % ) from the basolateral side ( Fig . 2 ) . Rabbit pig - R , permanently expressed in MDCK cells by transfection of its eDNA ( 21 ) appeared also basolaterally polarized ( 94 % ) with the biotinylation procedure ( Fig . 2 ) . Surface Delivery of gpll4 , Uvomorulln , and plg - R The biosynthesis of gp114 was followed by pulse - chase with " S methionine / 35S cysteine and immunoprecipitation . After a 20 - min pulse , a precursor 85 - kD form was rapidly con - verted into the mature ll4 - kD form within the first 45 min of chase ( Fig . 3 ) . The surface appearance of gpll4 and uvomorulin on confluent monolayers of MDCK cells grown on Transwells was studied by metabolic labeling with a 35S - methionine / 35S - cysteine pulse ( 20 min ) , followed by chase in a medium containing an excess of cold methionine and cysteine . At different times of chase , the cells were labeled either on their apical or their basolateral side with s - NHS - biotin and the antigens were immunoprecipitated , released from the beads , and precipitated with streptavidin coupled The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 110 , 1990 1534 on A ugu s t 16 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 3 .

Gpll4 arrived at the apical surface with a half time of 45 min , while uvomorulin made its ap - pearance on the basolateral membrane with a half time of 35 min ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . The time between the disappearance of the precursor form and the surface appearance of the mature form was 15 min for gpll4 and 20 min for uvomorulin ( Fig . 5 ) . Both antigens seemed to be delivered directly to their respective surface with 2 % missorting for uvomorulin and 8 % missorting for gpll4 ( Fig . 5 ) . At any time of the chase Figure 2 . Immunoprecipitation of gpll4 , uvomorulin ( Uvo ) , and plg - R after surface labeling of the apical ( A ) or the basolateral ( B ) sides of MDCK cell monolayers . The biotinylated proteins were re - vealed after SDS / 6 - - 16 % PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose by ~ 2SI - streptavidin blotting . Molecular weight marker is 116 kD . Gp114 was mainly detected in apically labeled cells while uvomoru - lin and plg - R were mainly detected in basolaterally labeled cells . The autoradiogram presented here for gpll4 was overexposed to show the basolateral pool of gp114 at the steady state . more gp114 was present on the apical than on the basolateral surface of the cells ( Fig . 5 ) and no peak of gp114 could be detected on the basolateral membrane . Furthermore , the level of gpll4 on the basolateral surface appeared to be steady even after 280 min of chase . Previous work with native liver and intestinal cells has suggested that certain apical proteins may appear transiently in the basolateral surface before final transfer to the apical surface ( 2 , 13 , 17 ) . To rule out the possibility that a similar transient appearance of gp114 in the basolateral surface of MDCK cells was missed by our domain - selective biotinyla - tion procedure , we carried out two types of experiments . First , we followed the cell - surface appearance of a protein for which this pathway has been very well documented , namely , the plg - R transfected into MDCK cells ( 21 ) . As de - scribed above for gpll4 and uvomorulin , MDCK mono - layers were pulsed ( I0 min ) with 35S - cysteine , chased for various times , and subjected to domain - selective biotinyla - tion , immunoprecipitation , and streptavidin - agarose precip - itation . The plg - R was first detected on the basolateral sur - face with a half time of 30 min , then on the apical membrane with a half time of 65 min , and was finally secreted into the apical medium with a half time of 135 min ( Fig . 5 ) . These results confirm the basolateral to apical transcytosis described for the plg - R in MDCK cells ( 4 , 21 ) and show that the proce - dure we used is sensitive enough to detect the transient ap - pearance of this receptor in the basolateral membrane . How - ever , a very fast transit of gp114 might have gone undetected . Therefore , as a second approach , we decided to study di - rectly the fate of the basolateral pool of gpll4 . Fate of the Basolateral Pool of gpll4 and plg - R For this purpose , we used our recent modification ( 15 ) of the technique described by Bretscher and LuRer ( 5 ) . Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells grown on filters were labeled at 4°C ( time 0 ) from the basolateral side with a cleavable ana - logue of s - NHS - biotin , s - NHS - SS - biotin . After labeling , the cells were warmed up for different times to allow endocyto - sis and the biotin remaining at the cell surface was stripped by reduction with 50 mM glutathione ( 15 ) . The cells were then extracted and the biotinylated antigens were immuno - precipitated , analyzed by SDS - PAGE under nonreducing con - ditions , and detected by ~ 5I - streptavidin blotting .

Appearance at the cell surface of gpll4 in MDCK cells . Cells were pulsed with 35S methionine and 35S cysteine for 20 min and chased for the times indicated . Newly synthesized gp114 was detected at the cell surface as described in Materials and Methods . lmmunopre - cipitated gp114 was analyzed by SDS / 6 - 16 % PAGE and fluorography . Molecular mass standards are from top to bottom 180 , 116 , 82 , and 58 kD . tosis of a given antigen was measured as the increase in the amount of biotinylated antigen that became resistant to glu - tathione reduction . To determine the efficiency of the technique , we studied the fate of plg - R in transfected MDCK cells . All the label incorporated from the basolateral side into plg - R ( Fig . 6 , lane a ) could be removed by the addition of glutathione at time 0 to the basolateral side ( lane d ) but not to the apical side ( lane g ) of the monolayer . On the other hand , incubation at 37°C resulted in fast protection of the biotinylated plg - R to reduction by glutathione from the basolateral side . Almost all plg - R was endocytosed by 30 min ( lanes e and f ) and be - came sensitive to apical reduction by about the same time ( lane h and i ) , consistent with the reported transcytotic path - way of this receptor ( 4 , 21 ) . The cleaved form of plg - R was detected in the apical medium somewhat later , by 120 min ( lanesj and k ) . Thus , biotinylation of plg - R did not prevent its normal transcytosis to the apical side or its release by pro - teolytic cleavage into the apical medium . In combination with glutathione reduction , this method allowed us to follow the fate of the basolateral pool of the receptor . We applied the same technique to follow the fate of the basolateral pool of gp114 by labeling the cells with s - NHS - SS - biotin at 0°C followed by incubation at 37°C . Even after 2 h at 37°C , gp114 labeled at time 0 on the basolateral surface was still sensitive to basolateral reduction ( Fig . 7 , lanes g - i ) and insensitive to apical reduction ( lanes d - f ) , indicating that very little transcytosis had occurred . Furthermore , when the rate of endocytosis of basolateral gp114 was com - pared with that of apical gpll4 , they were found to be very slow in both cases ( Fig . 8 ) . Taken together , these results show clearly that the gpll4 molecules present on the baso - lateral surface do not behave as a transient precursor pool to apical gp114 but , rather , as a stable missorted population . Discussion As part of our effort to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polar - ity , we characterized the biogenetic pathway of an integral membrane sialoglycoprotein of the apical surface of MDCK cells and compared it with the corresponding pathways of a basolateral protein , uvomorulin , and a transcytosing recep - tot , pIg - R . Gp114 was shown to be an apical component of MDCK cells by several criteria : ( a ) it is one of the major WGA - binding sialoglycoproteins detected in an apical mem - brane preparation ( 29 ) , from which we describe its purifica - tion in this report ; ( b ) it was localized to the apical pole by frozen sections ; and ( c ) by domain - selective cell surface labeling with s - NHS - biotin . Gp114 is an integral membrane glycoprotein because it partitions with Triton X - 114 ( 16 ) af - ter phase separation ( 3 ) and is not extractable by high pH ( 29 ) . Gpll4 was used as a model to study the surface delivery of apical proteins in MDCK cells . Using a combination of pulse - chase with 35S - methionine / 35S - cysteine , domain - se - lective surface biotinylation at different times of chase fol - lowed by immune - and streptavidin - agarose precipitation , gp114 appeared to be directly targeted to the apical mem - brane . Several results strongly suggested this pathway . At any time of the chase , we detected more gp114 on the apical than on the basolateral domain , and the gpll4 present on the basolateral membrane remained stable for at least 280 min with no observable peak , compatible with its being a mis - sorted population . Furthermore , the times between Golgi processing of precursor gp114 , as detected by shift to an Endo H - resistant , higher molecular weight form , and the basolateral or apical surface appearance of the processed form were very short and similar ( ' ~ 15 min ) . By compari - son , the predominantly lateral cell adhesion molecule uvo - morulin was directly targeted to the basolateral membrane , with only 2 % being missorted to the apical side , as shown for Na + , K + - ATPase ( 7 ) using domain - selective binding of photoactivatable ouabain and immunoprecipitation with an - tiouabain antibodies . That the surface - delivery assay described in this paper is sensitive enough to detect transient appearance of a protein in the basolateral membrane was shown by studies with MDCK cells permanently expressing pIg - R ( 21 ) . Previous studies using antibody binding have shown that this receptor is initially targeted to the basolateral membrane of the MDCK cells and is then transcytosed to the apical mem - brane and shed into the apical medium by proteolytic cleav - age ( 4 , 21 ) . Using the same protocol as for gp114 we showed that we could first detect the appearance of newly synthe - sized pIg - R on the basolateral surface followed by its arrival The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 110 , 1990 1536 on A ugu s t 16 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m % gp114 l O O ] 80 60 40 20 ! 300 1 O0 80 60 40 20 0 I !

En - docytosis and transcytosis of basolateral plg - R was followed using a procedure derived from Bretcher and Lutter ( 5 ) . Confluent monolayers were labeled with s - NHS - SS - biotin ( blot ) from the basolateral side at 4°C and reduced with glutathione ( glut ) from the apical ( a ) or the basolateral ( b ) side , immediately or after incuba - tion at 37°C for 0 , 0 . 5 , or 2 h . The plg - R was immunoprecipitated , analyzed by SDS / 6 - 12 % PAGE under nonreducing conditions , and revealed by ~ 25I - streptavidin blotting . The secretory component released into the apical medium was also analyzed ( Ap med ) . Mo - lecular mass standards are 116 kD for the left panel and 82 and 58 kD for the right panel . The plg - R was endocytosed ( lanes d - f ) , transcytosed ( lanes g - i ) , and secreted into the apical medium ( lanes j and k ) . at the apical surface and finally its release into the apical medium . We believe that domain - selective labeling with s - NHS - biotin has several advantages over surface immuno - precipitation . The accessibility of the basolateral domain should be more facile for biotin ( mol wt ~ 400 ) than for anti - bodies ( mol wt ' ~ 150 , 000 ) or even Fab fragments ( mol wt ' ~ 50 , 000 ) . This may be one of the reasons why we find a higher percent of basolateral pig - R , 95 % , rather than the 50 % / 20 % level reported by Breitfeld et al . ( 4 ) using anti - body ( Fab ) or ligand ( dimeric IgA ) binding ; another reason for the low apical level of plg - R may be recycling to an apical endocytic compartment ( 4 ) . In addition , biotin labeling has been shown to be restricted to the cell surface ( 30 ) , while surface immunoprecipitation can be contaminated by intra - cellular antigen during cell lysis , resulting in an overestima - tion of the percent of surface protein . Figure 7 . Fate of the basolateral pool of gp 114 . Endocytosis and transcytosis of basolaterai gp114 was studied by labeling the cells with s - NHS - SS - biotin ( blot ) from the basolateral side at 4°C and by reducing with glutathione ( glut ) from the apical ( a ) or the baso - lateral ( b ) side , immediately or after incubation at 37°C for 0 , 0 . 5 , or 2 h . Gp114 was immunoprecipitated , analyzed by SDS / 6 - 12 % PAGE under nonreducing conditions , and revealed by ~ 251 - strepta - vidin blotting . Gp114 was poorly endocytosed ( lanes g - i ) and trans - cytosed ( compare lanes a - c with d - f ) . Le Bivic et al .

Endocytosis of gp114 from the apical or the basolateral side . Cells were labeled with s - NHS - SS - biotin ( biot ) from the api - cal ( a ) or basolateral ( b ) sides at 4°C and reduced with glutathione ( glut ) from the apical ( a ) or the basolateral ( b ) side , immediately or after incubation at 37°C for 0 , 0 . 5 , or 2 h . Gpll4 was immuno - precipitated and analyzed by SDS / 6 - 12 % PAGE under nonreducing conditions and revealed by ~ 25I - streptavidin blotting . Very little en - docytosis was observed even after 2 h from both apical and basolateral sides ( compare lane c withfand lane i with I ) . Molecu - lar mass standards are 116 and 82 kD . Although the results with plg - R clearly show that we were able to detect a flux of protein in the basolateral membrane , they did not rule out completely a fast transit of gp114 through the basolateral domain . To directly study the fate of the basolateral pool of gpll4 we used a new assay ( 15 ) , de - rived from a procedure by Bretscher and Lutter ( 5 ) . This as - say employs a cleavable analog of s - NHS - biotin that is mem - brane impermeable and does not significantly cross the tight junctions . Using this analog , s - NHS - SS - biotin , we found the same polarity ratio for gpll4 as found with s - NHS - biotin ( compare Fig . 2 and 8 ) . To remove the biotin present at the cell surface we used glutathione ( 15 ) , that is membrane and tight junction impermeable , at least within the times used ( see Fig . 8 ) . By combining basolateral biotinylation of MDCK cells expressing the plg - R and domain selective reduction with glutathione , we showed that , when the cells were incubated at 37°C , the plg - R was endocytosed and transcytosed to be released into the apical medium . How - ever , using the same protocol , the basolateral pool of gp114 was shown to be endocytosed very slowly and not signifi - cantly transcytosed . This was not likely due to inactivation by biotin labeling since for the plg - R the normal pathway was not affected . These results indicate that gp114 has a long resi - dence time in the basolateral membrane , where it behaves as a stable pool of newly synthesized protein . Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of intracellular sorting and vectorial delivery of plasma membrane proteins in MDCK cells ( 16 , 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 ) . It is of great interest to apply the methods used here to the study of the biogenetic pathways of apical proteins in intesti - nal cell lines . It has been proposed that in the enterocyte two of the major apical hydrolases , sucrase - isomaltase and amino - peptidase N , are sorted at the level of the basolateral domain ( 13 , 17 ) . Recently , we found that one apical and one basola - teral protein are sorted intracellularly in an intestinal cell line , SK - CO - 15 ( 15 ) . However , using an identical approach in CaCo - 2 cells , newly synthesized aminopeptidase was de - tected transiently on the basolateral surface while basola - teral alkaline phosphatase seemed to behave as a stable mis - sorted pool ( like gpll4 in MDCK cells ) ( Le Bivic , A . , A . Quaroni , B . Nichols , and E . Rodriguez - Boulan , manuscript submitted for publication ) . The study of other apical pro - teins will be necessary to define the prevalence of direct versus indirect pathways in intestinal cells . It will be particu - larly informative to study proteins that , endogenously or by transfection , are expressed in both liver and a cultured epi - thelial line . In this regard , it is interesting to note that gp114 shares many common features with two apical proteins in the liver , the gp110 and HA4 ( 1 , 9 ) . They all bind WGA and are integral membrane proteins heavily glycosylated with core proteins having similar molecular weights ( 1 , 9 ) . Comparing these proteins would be of interest , considering that an in - direct pathway was proposed for HA4 ( 2 ) in liver . We thank Dr . Barry Gumbiner for mAbs against uvomorulin ; Dr .

Brauchbar , K . Bucher , and H . - P . Hauri ( Cell . 1990 . 60 : 429 - 437 ) showed that several apical hydrolases follow both vectorial and transcytotic routes to the apical surface of intestinal ( CaCo - 2 ) cells . In their study , Mater et al . employed various types of targeting assays , including biotin targeting assays similar to those that we recently published ( 15 , 16 ) and that we use in this report .
