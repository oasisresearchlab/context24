One of the deﬁning features of this domain is the protein caveolin . The exact function of caveolin , however , is not clear . One possible function is to attract adapter molecules to caveolae in a manner similar to how clathrin attracts molecules to coated pits . Here , we characterize a candidate adapter molecule called SRBC . SRBC binds PKC d and is a member of the STICK ( substrates that interact with C - kinase ) superfamily of PKC - binding proteins . We also show it co - immunoprecipitates with caveolin - 1 . A leucine zipper in SRBC is essential for both co - precipita - tion with caveolin and localization to caveolae . SRBC remains associated with caveolin when caveolae bud to form vesicles ( cavicles ) that travel on microtubules to different regions of the cell . In the absence of SRBC , intracellular cavicle trafﬁc is markedly impaired . We con - clude that SRBC ( sdr - related gene product that binds to c - kinase ) and two other family members [ PTRF ( Pol I and transcription release factor ) and SDPR ] function as caveo - lin adapter molecules that regulate caveolae function .

They can occupy 18 – 40 % of the plasma membrane surface ( Chang et al , 1994 ) and engage in at least three different types of dynamic activities ( Mundy et al , 2002 ; White and Anderson , 2005 ) . Type 1 caveolae are able to pinch off the membrane to form endocytic vesicles called cavicles ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) that can carry cargo such as SV40 virus to specialized endosomes called caveosomes ( Pelkmans et al , 2001 ) . Cavicles can also travel to the recycling endosome region of the cell ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) . Cavicle movement to these sites is microtubule dependent . Type 2 caveolae , which are the most abundant type , superﬁcially appear not to be dynamic ( Thomsen et al , 2002 ) . Recent studies suggest , however , that quantal units of caveolae are engaged in continuous rounds of ﬁssion and fusion at the cell surface ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ) . Quantal caveolae behaviour exhibits the same kinetics and characteristics as folate receptor internalization and recycling by potocytosis ( Anderson et al , 1992 ) , which is a caveolae - dependent mechanism for deliver - ing vitamins and ions such as calcium ( Isshiki et al , 2002 ) to the cell interior . Type 2 cavicles can also move rapidly just beneath the membrane . The third type of caveolae behaviour ( type 3 ) is the relatively uncharacterized ability of these domains to form long , thin caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) - positive tubules that project from the plasma membrane deep into the cell interior ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) . There are no known functions for these tubules , but GPI - anchored prions have been localized to these structures by immunogold electron microscopy ( EM ) ( Peters et al , 2003 ) . Type 3 caveolae may mediate Cav3 - rich tubule formation during skeletal muscle cell development ( Parton et al , 1997 ) . All three types of caveolae behaviours can occur in the same cell . The three pathways depend on the ability of caveolae to form ﬂask or tubular invaginations and , at least for types 1 and 2 , seal off from the extracellular space . Several years ago we initiated a search for molecules that control caveolae internalization and identiﬁed PKC a as a regulator of type 2 caveolae internalization ( Smart et al , 1995a ) . PKC a is highly enriched in caveolae ( Smart et al , 1995a ) , and deletion of PKC a from cells or displacement from caveolae by AlF 4 or inactivation with inhibitors ( Mineo and Anderson , 2001 ) blocks uptake of folate receptors and ﬂattens the ﬂask - shaped morphology of caveolae . PKC a is probably a natural regulator of caveolae internalization because activation of histamine H1 receptors , which causes the dissociation of PKC a from caveolae , transiently blocks folate internalization ( Smart et al , 1995a ) . Phosphorylation of an unidentiﬁed 90 - kDa protein by PKC a has been linked to caveolae internalization . On the basis of these observations , we hypothesized that caveolae contain a protein ( s ) that recruits PKC a to this domain . Subsequently , we identiﬁed SDR ( serum deprivation response ) protein as a PKC a - binding protein that is enriched in caveolae ( Mineo et al , 1998 ) . PKC a binding to SDR in caveolae is dependent on amino acids 145 – 250 of SDR , calcium and an intact PKC regulatory domain . Addition of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is not required . SDR ( also called PS - p68 and SDPR ) is a 412 - amino - acid modular protein that contains a leucine zipper ( LZ ) , a PKC - binding site , a PKC phosphorylation site , a PS - binding site and two PEST domains . These structural motifs are also found in PTRF [ Pol I and transcription release factor ( Jansa et al , 1998 ) , also called , cavin / cav - p60 ( Voldstedlund et al , 2003 ; Vinten et al , 2005 ) ] and SRBC [ sdr - related gene product that binds to c - kinase ( Izumi et al , 1997 ) ] .

In addition to PKC - binding sites , all STICK proteins contain PS - binding sites and are found at the interface between membranes and the cytoskeleton . They include MARCKS , annexin I and II , desmoykin , vinculin / talin , a - and b - adducin , GAP43 and AKAP79 . Recently , PTRF was reported to be concentrated in adipo - cyte ( Vinten et al , 2005 ; Aboulaich et al , 2006 ; Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) and smooth muscle caveolae ( Voldstedlund et al , 2003 ) , even though it was originally identiﬁed and studied as a transcription release factor ( Jansa et al , 1998 , 2001 ; Jansa and Grummt , 1999 ; Hasegawa et al , 2000 ) . PTRF has also been implicated in regulating caveolae function ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) . In contrast to SDPR and PTRF , a relationship between SRBC and caveolae function has not been established . SRBC was initially identiﬁed in overlay assays as a PKC d - binding protein ( Izumi et al , 1997 ) . PKC d binds and phos - phorylates SRBC in vitro . Similar to SDPR , the mRNA for SRBC is induced in response to serum deprivation as well as during retinoic acid - induced differentiation of P19 cells . SRBC was also identiﬁed in a yeast two - hybrid screen as a BRCA1 - interacting protein ( Xu et al , 2001 ) . The human SRBC gene maps to 11p15 . 5 – 15 . 4 , which is a suppressor region that is mutated in a number of sporadic breast , lung and ovarian cancers . The loss of SRBC in these cancers appears to be caused by DNA methylation and subsequent gene silencing . A follow - up study ( Zochbauer - Muller et al , 2005 ) suggests , however , that DNA methylation is not the only mechanism of SRBC loss in lung cancer cells . SRBC is also downregulated in gastric cancer ( Lee et al , 2007 ) . A naturally occurring fusion protein isolated from colon cancer cells , which consists of the ﬁrst 184 amino acids of SRBC linked to c - Raf , has cell - transforming activity ( Tahira et al , 1987 ) . Interestingly , acti - vation of c - Raf occurs in caveolae ( Mineo et al , 1996 ) and Raf fused to the C - terminal consensus sequence for prenylation is constitutively active in this domain ( Mineo et al , 1997 ) . It is possible , therefore , that the SRBC – Raf fusion protein inap - propriately targets c - Raf to caveolae where it is constitutively active . Here , we report that SRBC is highly localized to caveolae . Targeting of SRBC to caveolae depends on both the LZ domain of SRBC and the expression of Cav1 . SRBC is down - regulated in response to depletion of Cav1 , suggesting that Cav1 stabilizes SRBC . Spinning disc confocal microscopy shows that SRBC is in caveolae , cavicles and caveosomes and trafﬁcs with Cav1 to different locations in the cell . In the absence of SRBC , however , intracellular cavicle trafﬁc is markedly impaired . Results SRBC was identiﬁed in a proteomic screen for proteins enriched in detergent - free caveolae , puriﬁed from various cell types ( Aboulaich et al , 2004 ; McMahon et al , 2006 ) . Alternative splicing of the mRNA for SRBC can potentially produce ﬁve different transcripts . The domain organization of these ﬁve proteins is shown in Figure 1A . The isoform used in the current study is hSRBC b , which codes for a 261 - amino - acid - long protein designated hSRBC ( Izumi et al , 1997 ) . All ﬁve isoforms are predicted to be soluble proteins . We used immunoﬂuorescence and immunogold EM to verify that SRBC is enriched in caveolae . The SRBC mAb we used is directed against the C - terminal end of hSRBC a , b ( Figure 1A , bracket , hSRBC b ) and recognizes only human SRBC . This antibody , which detects a single 45 - kDa band on immunoblots , colocalizes with Cav1 ( Figure 1B – F ) . The scatter plot ( Figure 1D ) shows the red and green intensities at each pixel . From these data , we calculated the Pearson’s coefﬁcient of correlation ( PCC ) , which measures how well two ﬂuorescent foci coincide ( Costes et al , 2004 ) , to be 0 . 88 where 1 . 0 represents perfect colocalization . Another measure of coincidences of the two signals is the colocalization channel ( Figure 1F ) , which is a z - axis projection showing voxels that have a statistically signiﬁcant colocalization . Finally , immunogold labelling ( Figure 1G ) showed a high degree of gold localization to invaginated caveolae as well as endosomal structures that could be either caveosomes or cavicles . Substitution of an irrelevant mAb for a - SRBC IgG did not give labelling ( data not shown ) . Therefore , hSRBC is preferentially associated with caveolae as well as caveolae - derived endo - membranes . hSRBC is localized to caveolae in many different human tissue culture cell lines ( data not shown ) . Tissue distribution of SRBC We used immunoﬂuorescence to identify tissues that express both hSRBC and Cav1 and determine whether they were both in the same cell type . Samples of human skeletal muscle , liver , stomach , lung , kidney and heart were pro - cessed for indirect immunoﬂuorescence ( Figure 2 ) . Both proteins were expressed in all the tissues we examined , but not in every cell type within an individual tissue . For exam - ple , blood vessels expressed both proteins ( yellow in the merge ) in skeletal muscle tissue , whereas muscle cells per se expressed Cav1 but not SRBC ( red in merge ) . In stomach , connective tissue cells expressed both proteins but neither protein was expressed in epithelium . Importantly , even though many cells expressed Cav1 but not hSRBC ( red in the merge images of skeletal , liver , lung and kidney ) , rarely did we ﬁnd cells that expressed only SRBC . This raises the possibility that SRBC expression may be linked to Cav1 expression . LZ is required for targeting to caveolae We used site - directed mutagenesis to identify regions of SRBC that might be necessary for targeting the protein to caveolae ( Figure 3 ) . There are at least four regions that could be involved in targeting ( Figure 3A ) ; a LZ ( aa 22 – 70 ) , two PEST domains ( aa 140 – 173 and 225 – 241 ) , a putative PS - binding site ( aa 113 – 124 ) and a PKC - interacting region ( aa 175 – 194 ) . We constructed ﬁve cDNAs coding for wild type ( WT ) and mutant hSRBC tagged with HA . Each cDNA was expressed in human ﬁbroblasts and the samples were processed to localize HA ( green ) and endogenous Cav1 ( red ) . As expected , the WT HA – SRBC colocalized with Cav1 ( Figure 3B , WT coloc ) with a PCC of 0 . 74 . Deletion of the LZ shifted hSRBC from caveolae to the cytoplasm and nu - cleus of the cell ( Figure 3C ) , giving a PCC of – 0 . 08 , which indicates no speciﬁc association with Cav1 . By contrast , SRBC / cavin - 3 regulates caveolae function K - A McMahon et al The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 8 | 2009 & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization 1002 deletion of the PS - binding site ( Figure 3D ) or the PKC - binding region ( Figure 3E ) or the PEST domain between amino acids 215 – 241 ( Figure 3F ) had little affect on colocalization ( coloc ) with caveolin . The PCC for these constructs was 0 . 63 , 0 . 61 and 0 . 78 , respectively . To determine the general importance of LZ in targeting this family of proteins to caveolae , we studied SDPR ( Figure 4A ) . Similar to hSRBC , SDPR colocalizes with Cav1 ( Figure 4B ; Supplementary Figure 1SA ) and both hSRBC and SDPR colocalize with each other ( Supplementary Figure 1SB ) . The Figure 1 hSRBC is localized to human ﬁbroblast caveolae . ( A ) The domain structure of ﬁve predicted isoforms of human SRBC . Only hSRBC b was used in this study .

First , we constructed cDNAs that code for amino acids 1 – 337 ( WT ) , 1 – 168 and D 52 – 100 , all tagged with HA , and expressed them in human ﬁbroblasts . The WT ( Figure 4B , WT ) and the 1 – 168 construct ( Figure 4C , 1 – 168 ) localized to caveolae . The SDPR construct lacking the LZ domain , by contrast , was found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell but did not colocalize with Cav1 ( Figure 4D , 52 – 100 , PCC ¼ – 0 . 236 ) . Likewise an SDPR with leucines 86 , 93 and 100 changed to glutamic acid did not colocalize with Cav1 ( Supplementary Figure 1SC ) .

Immortalized ﬁbroblasts derived from Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were transfected with HA – hSRBC alone ( Figure 5A and B ) and processed for indirect immunoﬂuorescence detection of HA . HA – hSRBC was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5B ) of cells that lack Cav1 ( Figure 5A ) . By contrast , when HA – hSRBC was co - transfected with Cav1 – GFP , the two proteins colocalized ( Figure 5C and D ) and the distribution precisely matched the caveolae staining - pattern usually seen in ﬁbroblasts . Other experiments showed that Cav3 – Myc effectively substituted for Cav1 ( Figure 5E and F ) , whereas hSRBC did not colocalize with Cav2 – GFP that appeared to have a Golgi apparatus staining pattern ( Figure 5G and H ) . A similar result was obtained with SDPR ( data not shown ) . We conclude that all three members of this family depend on either Cav1 or Cav3 to reach the cell surface . A requirement for Cav1 in hSRBC targeting to caveolae suggests the two may physically and functionally interact . To test for a physical interaction , we used an immunoprecipita - tion protocol to see whether the two proteins would recipro - cally co - precipitate from solubilized SV589 human ﬁbroblasts . We solubilized the postnuclear supernatant fraction of these cells using a mixture of Triton X - 100 and octylglucoside to ensure the complete solubilization of the caveolae , and then we incubated the soluble material with beads containing either a - Cav1 IgG ( Figure 5I , left panel ) or a - SRBC IgG ( Figure 5I , right panel ) . The beads were washed before the bound pro - teins were processed for immunoblotting with either a - SRBC IgG ( Figure 5I , IB , left panel ) or a - Cav1 IgG ( Figure 5I , IB , right panel ) . The immunoblots show that a - Cav1 immunoprecipi - tated hSRBC and a - SRBC immunoprecipitated Cav1 . Therefore , under conditions when both proteins are in caveo - lae the two proteins are directly or indirectly interacting . In the tissue survey , we carried out to localize Cav1 - and hSRBC - expressing cells ( Figure 2 ) , we rarely found Cav1 - negative cells that expressed hSRBC . To explore the possible signiﬁcance of this observation , we used small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) to reduce the level of Cav1 in ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 5J ) . When we depleted ﬁbroblast Cav1 ( lane 1 ) , the amount of hSRBC in the cell markedly declined . A control siRNA did not affect the level of either hSRBC or Cav1 ( lanes 2 and 4 ) . By contrast , reducing hSRBC levels did not affect the amount of detectable Cav1 ( lane 3 ) . Therefore , the presence of hSRBC appears to be linked to the presence of Cav1 , which may explain why we rarely found cells in tissues that expressed hSRBC alone .

Cav1 and EPS15R were not present in the immunoprecipitate of D LZ – SRBC . Lysates used for the immunoprecipitation contained similar amounts of the expressed ( SRBC and D LZ – SRBC ) as well as endogenous ( Cav1 and EPS15R ) protein ( data not shown ) . Cav1 and hSRBC trafﬁc together in cells Live cell imaging of Cav – GFP has shown that Cav1 - rich membranes engage in three types of membrane trafﬁc ( types 1 – 3 ) . To see whether hSRBC trafﬁcs with all three types of Cav1 - rich membranes , we co - expressed in HeLa cells either hSRBC – tdTomato and Cav1 – GFP ( Figure 7A – C ) or Cav1 – tdTomato and hSRBC – GFP ( Figure 7D – F ) and recorded the behaviour of the two proteins with a spinning disc confocal microscope using excitation at 488nm ( GFP ) and 568nm ( tdTomato ) and the appropriate band - pass ﬁlters to separate the two ﬂuorescence signals ( Supplementary Movies S1 – S3 ) . In agreement with our immunoﬂuorescence data , hSRBC highly colocalized with caveolin ( Figure 7A , yellow ) , both on the cell surface and on internal vesicles . Live cell imaging detected all three types of caveolin - rich membranes and in each case SRBC was present . Still images of types 1 and 2 caveolae movement are analysed in Figure 7 . Type 1 hSRBC / Cav - positive cavicles moved at B 0 . 8 – 2 . 03 m m / s for several micrometres as if travelling along microtubules ( Figure 7B and C , still images ; Supplementary Movie S1 ) . Interestingly , cavicles displayed saltatory movement ( Supple - mentary Movie S1 ) . They paused 11 – 33 s ( Figure 7A , arrowheads ) between segments and often changed direction when movement resumed . Type 2 hSRBC / Cav1 - positive cavicles were seen travelling ( Supplementary Movie S2 ) beneath the plasma membrane at an average rate of 2 . 6 m m / s ( Figure 7D – F , arrow and circles ) . This population of cavicles did not exhibit long pauses nor did they change direction . Type 3 tubular caveolae were also positive for both hSRBC and caveolin ( Supplementary Movie S3 ) . These results indicate that hSRBC is intimately associated with caveolae as well as caveolae - derived membranes such as cavicles and caveosomes , and they both remain associated with these membranes as they travel in the cell . SRBC regulates cavicle trafﬁc As pointed out earlier , PKC a regulates caveolae internaliza - tion ( Smart et al , 1994 , 1995a ) and SDPR ( also called as SDR ) is a candidate caveolar protein responsible for recruiting PKC a to this domain ( Mineo et al , 1998 ) . We used quantita - tive EM to see whether reducing the level of SDPR RNA in ﬁbroblasts affects caveolae invagination ( Figure 8 ) . Immortalized human ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 8A ) incubated in the presence of an siRNA against SDPR showed a marked reduction in the number of invaginated caveolae ( arrows ) compared with cells treated with control siRNA . We quanti - ﬁed the effect of SDPR siRNA in six trials , four for HeLa cells and two for immortalized human cells , by counting the number of invaginated caveola ( Figure 8B ) . SDPR siRNA effectively reduced the amount of SDPR RNA in the cell in each trial . On average , the SDPR siRNA caused B 57 % decline in invaginated caveolae in HeLa cells and B 37 % in the immortal ﬁbroblast . These results , together with reports that PTRF regulates the number of invaginated caveolae ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) , suggest that hSRBC might also have a function in the budding and / or trafﬁc of caveolae - rich membranes . Therefore , we set up a ﬂuorescence recov - ery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) assay to determine whether hSRBC affects caveolin – GFP trafﬁc . Previous live cell imaging experiments showed that in CHO cells GFP - positive cavicles in the centrosome region of the cell overlap with recycling endosomes containing transferrin receptors ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) , and that disrupting microtu - bules with nocodazole prevented cavicle accumulation at this site ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) . These experiments suggest that cavicles are dynamically associated with the centrosomal region of the cell . We developed an FRAP assay that allowed us to measure the effect of SRBC on cavicle movement from peripheral sites to the centrosomal region . We photobleached the interior population of caveolin – GFP without bleaching the periphery ( Figure 9B ) , and then monitored the reappear - ance of individual particles ( cavicles ) in the centrosomal 35 28 * IgG heavy IgG light WT SRBC – HA Δ LZ – SRBC – HA 52 92 113 EPS15R Silver stained WT Δ LZ IgG ( L ) Δ LZ – SRBC – HA IgG ( H ) WT SRBC – HA IP / WB 52 35 28 α - Cav1 28 α - EPS15R 92 * * 1 2 3 1 2 3 EV WT Δ LZ EV Figure 6 Immunoprecipitation of hSRBC co - precipitates Cav1 and EPS15R .

Under these conditions , the repopulating cavicles can come either from caveolae that have budded from the plasma membrane or existing cavicles in a remote focal plane of the cell that was not bleached . Particles within the region of interest were identiﬁed in each frame of the recovery sequence ( Figure 9B , square ) using the Spots algorithm of Imaris software ( Bitplane , Zurich , SW ) . The data for each cell was normalized to the baseline number of spots in the ﬁrst frame obtained after bleaching . The values from approximately 10 cells were averaged for each time point and used to generate a particle reappearance curve ( Figure 9C – F ) . As a positive control for the ability of this assay to detect the cavicle movement , we used HeLa cells expressing caveolin – GFP that had been grown in the pre - sence or absence ( Figure 9C , blue diamonds ) of either nocodazole ( yellow triangle ) or genistein ( red square ) . Genistein is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks caveolae endocytosis ( Pelkmans et al , 2001 ) .

( A – C ) The path followed by a single hSRBC – tdTomato / caveolin – GFP - positive type 1 cavicle is traced using Adobe Premiere . The trajectory of the cavicle was divided into four segments . At each of the positions indicated by the arrowheads , the cavicle stopped and hovered on average 19s ( 33 , 11 and 15s ) before moving on in a new direction . The mean velocity of the moving cavicle , averaged over the four segments , was 1 . 3 m m / s ( 1 . 22 , 1 . 17 , 0 . 8 and 2 . 03 m m / s ) .

SRBC / cavin - 3 regulates caveolae function K - A McMahon et al & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 8 | 2009 1009 untreated cells had accumulated on average 20 particles in the bleached region . Nocodazole reduced the accumulation to 2 . 5 particles ( seven - fold suppression ) and genistein to 10 particles ( B 2 - fold suppression ) . We conclude that the FRAP assay quantitatively detects cavicle migration to the centro - some and can be used to detect the effect of inhibitors of the process . We next used the FRAP assay to determine whether hSRBC inﬂuences cavicle trafﬁc . We used three non - small cell lung cancer cell lines that express Cav1 but not hSRBC ( Sunaga et al , 2004 ) . Immunoblots show that these three lines express very little ( Figure 9A , lane 3 ) to no hSRBC ( lanes 2 and 4 ) compared with HeLa cells ( lane 1 ) . When any one of these cell types is transfected with a cDNA coding for caveolin – GFP , the GFP signal is found at the cell surface as well as in vesicular structures clustered near the centre of the cell ( Figure 9B ) just as in HeLa cells . Each of the three cell lines ( Figure 9D – F ) was co - transfected with caveolin – GFP plus either empty vector ( blue squares ) or vector containing the cDNA for hSRBC ( red squares ) . Cavicle trafﬁc was then measured using the FRAP method ( see Materials and meth - ods ) . Comparing the three cells , we found that hSRBC - expressing cells exhibited a 2 - to 10 - fold increase in particle accumulation following photobleaching . This result suggests that hSRBC regulates microtubule - dependent cavicle trafﬁc to the centrosome of these cells . Discussion SRBC is the third member of a family of three proteins that have been implicated in regulating caveolae function . Immunoﬂuorescence shows that all of these proteins are selectively concentrated in caveolae , and that an individual caveola can contain more than one member of the family ( for example , Supplementary Figure 1S , SDPR and hSRBC ) . The ability of these proteins to concentrate in caveolae is either directly or indirectly dependent on the expression of Cav1 . At least for SDPR and hSRBC , these proteins can associate with both Cav1 and signalling molecules such as PKC . Therefore , SDPR , PTRF and hSRBC appear to have the properties of a caveolin adapter molecule that links signal transduction to the regulation of caveolae function . On the basis of these similar properties , it seems reasonable that the diverse in - dividual names these proteins have acquired over the years be consolidated with the general family name cavin ( Vinten et al , 2005 ) and the individual names of cavin - 1 ( PTRF ) , cavin - 2 ( SDPR ) and cavin - 3 ( SRBC ) . Cavin - 1 and caveolae assembly Cavin - 1 / PTRF was originally identiﬁed as a factor that sti - mulated the release of pre - rRNA and Pol I from templates during Pol I - mediated RNA transcription ( Jansa et al , 1998 ) . Consistent with this function , cavin - 1 interacts with the transcription termination factor TTF - 1 , Pol I , and the 3 0 end of pre - rRNA . Cavin - 1 has two putative nuclear localization signals ( amino acids 143 – 157 and 196 – 210 ) and , in addition to its transcription termination function , can stimulate gene transcription ( Jansa et al , 1998 ) . Stimulation of transcription has been linked to its RNA releasing activity ( Jansa et al , 2001 ) . Cavin - 1 can also suppress the function of the type I collagen transcription factor BFCOLI ( Hasegawa et al , 2000 ) , which raises the possibility that it regulates multiple genes . In the face of these well - documented activities , it is some - what surprising that in several cell types most of the detect - able cavin - 1 is in caveolae ( Aboulaich et al , 2004 ; Vinten et al , 2005 ; Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) . Moreover , two recent studies ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) suggest that cells lacking cavin - 1 are defective in caveolae formation . The role of cavin - 1 in caveolae assembly has not been determined . It is important to note , however , both studies reported that knocking down cavin - 1 in 3T3 L1 cells markedly reduces the level of Cav1 ( as much as 75 % ) . Cav1 is thought to be essential for caveolae formation , which raises the possibility that cavin - 1 function in part is to control the number and function of surface caveolae by regulating the transcription of the Cav1 gene . Indeed , overexpressing cavin - 1 causes a concomitant increase in the amount of Cav1 ( Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) .

Arrows indicate caveolae . Bar ¼ 1 m m . ( B ) The number of caveolae in each sample was quantiﬁed by measuring the number of caveolae per micrometre of cell surface . Either HeLa cells ( experiments 1 – 4 ) or SV40 - transformed human ﬁbroblasts ( experiments 5 and 6 ) were incubated in the presence of siRNA directed against the RNA of SDPR ( SDPR siRNA ) or a sense siRNA ( Ctrl - siRNA ) for 48h and the amount of SDPR RNAwas detected by PCR . The number of invaginated caveolae in each trial was then measured directly on printed electron micrographs . Averaging four trials for HeLa cells , we saw an B 57 % reduction of invaginated caveolae . For human ﬁbroblast , an B 37 % loss in SDPR siRNA - treated cells was observed . An observer who did not know the identity of the samples carried out the quantiﬁcation .

Adapter function of cavins In contrast to cavin - 1 , there is no direct evidence that either cavin - 2 / SDPR or cavin - 3 / SRBC regulates the transcription of Cav1 . To the contrary , we found that Cav1 controls the level of cavin - 3 in the cell . As these two cavins share with cavin - 1 the ability to target caveolae , we focused on identify - ing a possible adapter function . Adapter proteins regulate the interactions between signalling molecules located in speciﬁc cellular compartments .

The white box shows the region where particles were counted using Imaris Spots to generate the data depicted on the graphs . To compensate for the loss of total intensity due to photobleaching over the time course of the recovery , Adobe Photoshop was used to enhance the image in the bottom panel by smoothing it with a Gaussian ﬁlter of 0 . 5 pixel radius to remove shot noise and then rescaling it so that the intensity of the unbleached rim of the cell was comparable to the intensity in the ﬁrst two panels .

A single frame was acquired before bleaching with a 488 laser line at full power for up to 25s . Recovery was recorded for 150s after photobleaching . For each FRAP time - lapse sequence , a rectangular region at the centrosome was analysed for particle number with time using the Spots module of Imaris ( Bitplane ) . The particle number in the ﬁrst frame was taken as the baseline . Each time point in Figure 8 is the average particle number from B 10 cells . SRBC / cavin - 3 regulates caveolae function K - A McMahon et al & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 8 | 2009 1011 adapter partner ( s ) is in caveolae . Mutagenesis experiments showed that targeting of cavin - 3 to caveolae was dependent on a four heptad repeat , LZ between amino acids 20 and 76 . A three heptad LZ in cavin - 2 is also critical for targeting to caveolae , which suggests a general function for LZs in targeting cavins to caveolae . Immunoprecipitation showed that one of the cavin - 3 - interacting molecules in caveolae is Cav1 and that deleting the LZ blocks this interaction . Another protein that co - precipitated with cavin - 3 is EPS15R , which was detected previously in a proteomic analysis of caveolae isolated from adipocytes ( Aboulaich et al , 2004 ) . We conclude that cavins are adapter proteins that link PKC to regulatory networks involved in controlling caveolae function . A model protein for understanding how cavin - 3 might function is the adapter SLP - 65 , which is a critical upstream regulator of the B - cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) ( Engelke et al , 2007 ) . SLP - 65 - deﬁcient mice are defective in B - cell develop - ment and activation , and they exhibit an increase in pre - B - cell leukaemia . Thus , SLP - 65 is a tumour suppressor that increases differentiation and suppresses proliferation of pre - B cells . Cavin - 3 has also been reported to be a tumour sup - pressor . It was isolated in a two - hybrid screen with the ﬁrst 304 amino acids of BRCA1 and found to be inactive or absent in many breast , lung and ovarian cancer cells ( Xu et al , 2001 ) . The adapter function of SLP - 65 depends on the molecule being at the plasma membrane . Similar to cavin - 3 , targeting to the cell surface depends on an LZ ( Kohler et al , 2005 ) . Site - directed substitution of glutamate at L18 and I25 in the LZ converts SLP - 65 to a cytosolic protein that is no longer active . Adapter function is restored if a myristoylation consensus sequence is introduced at the N terminus of the LZ - defective protein . LZs , therefore , may have a general function in targeting adapters and other signalling machinery to plasma membrane domains such as caveolae . Cavin - 3 regulates trafﬁc and / or budding of caveolae Although SLP - 65 is intimately involved in regulating the mobilization of cellular Ca 2 þ , the exact signalling pathways regulated by cavins are not clear . Lowering the level of cavin - 1 ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) or cavin - 2 ( Figure 8 ) reduces the number of detectable caveolae . The loss of visible caveolae could be due to a block in the conversion of ﬂat caveolae to invaginated caveolae as occurs when cells are depleted of PKC a ( Smart et al , 1994 ) , a block in the recycling of caveolae following endocytosis ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) or a defect in caveolae assembly ( Hill et al , 2008 ; Liu and Pilch , 2008 ) . To assay for cavin - 3 - dependent functions , we developed an FRAP assay that measures the ability of Cav1 – GFP - positive cavicles to repopulate the centrosomal region of the cell where recycling endosomes reside . Repopulation involves type 1 transport of newly budded caveolae to the centrosome ( in - hibited by both genistein and nocodazole ) as well as the arrival of existing cavicles that have travelled on microtubules from different regions of the cell ( inhibited by nocodazole alone ) . We used three lung cancer cell lines that all lack detectable cavin - 3 . GFP - positive cavicle recovery after photo - bleaching in these cells is very slow ( Figure 9 ) . In each cell type , however , introduction of cavin - 3 markedly accelerates the reappearance of cavicles in the centrosome . These experi - ments suggest that cavin - 3 regulates caveolae budding or movement of cavicles along microtubules or both . These studies suggest that one of the adapter functions of cavin - 3 , and cavins in general , is to regulate caveolae trafﬁc . Cavin - 1 and - 2 may regulate caveolae budding , caveolae assembly or both . The assay methods used in these studies cannot distinguish between the two processes . By contrast , Cavin - 3 may regulate the migration of cavicles on microtu - bules . As all three proteins contain PKC - binding motifs and both cavin - 2 and - 3 have been shown to bind PKC a and PKC d , respectively , most likely a general function of cavins is to compartmentalize PKC kinase activity in Cav1 - rich mem - branes . Importantly , PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine block endocytosis by caveolae ( Mineo and Anderson , 2001 ; Pelkmans et al , 2001 ) . It will be important in future studies to identify the PKC substrates in caveolae , the role of each cavin in targeting the PKC to caveolae and how these substrates function . Cavin - 3 modulation of EGFR targeting to caveolae The PKC adapter function of cavin - 3 may be linked to the targeting of EGFR to caveolae . EGFR was the ﬁrst receptor tyrosine kinase localized to isolated caveolae ( Smart et al , 1995b ) . Subsequent work ( Mineo et al , 1999 ) determined that under quiescent conditions EGFR is highly enriched ( B 7 - fold ) in caveolae but rapidly departs this domain when the cells are exposed to EGF . EGFR migration from caveolae depends on EGF binding plus a functional tyrosine residue in the regulatory region of the cytoplasmic tail . PKC - depen - dent phosphorylation of serine 654 markedly reduces EGF - stimulated migration of EGFR from caveolae . Therefore , one way that cavin - 3 may affect localization of EGFR to caveolae is by linking PKC d to the phosphorylation of EGFR . There is a second way cavin - 3 may regulate the concentra - tion of EGFR in caveolae . We found that immunoprecipitates of cavin - 3 contain EPS15R , whereas immunoprecipitates of a D LZ cavin - 3 do not ( Figure 6 ) . Immunoprecipitates of Cav1 also contain EPS15R ( Hartung et al , 2006 ) . EPS15R is a soluble , Ca 2 þ - binding protein related to the EGFR substrate EPS15 that contains multiple EPS15 homology ( EH ) domains as well as ubiquitin - interacting motifs ( UIMs ) . EH domains have been implicated in regulating endocytosis , vesicle trafﬁc and signal transduction ( Carbone et al , 1997 ) . Recent studies suggest that EPS15R and the related molecules , EPS15 and epsin , have a critical function in retaining ubiquitinated EGFR in caveolae ( Sigismund et al , 2005 ) . Ubiquitinated EGFR is enriched in caveolae , and high levels of EGF in the media increase the level of ubiquitinated EGFR . This modiﬁed EGFR tends to be internalized by caveolae . By contrast , Y1045F EGFR , which cannot be ubiquitinated , is preferentially inter - nalized by clathrin - coated pits . Therefore , a direct interaction between cavin - 3 and the UIMs of EPS15 or EPS15R or epsin may function to regulate the trafﬁc of EGFR to and from caveolae membranes . This model implies that cavin - 3 links ubiquitinated EGFR to caveolae , whereas unmodiﬁed EGFR , released from caveolae , moves to other membrane domains such as clathrin - coated pits . Conclusion Cavins are the ﬁrst set of caveolae proteins that appear to have adapter functions analogous to the clathrin adapter complexes identiﬁed over 20 years ago . Clathrin adapters were ﬁrst identiﬁed by their ability to promote the assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles in vitro ( Keen et al , 1979 ) . SRBC / cavin - 3 regulates caveolae function K - A McMahon et al The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 8 | 2009 & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization 1012 Subsequently , this set of molecules was implicated in a range of activities including attracting membrane receptors to coated pits for internalization ( Pearse , 1988 ) . A better under - standing of the manner in which cavins work undoubtedly will reveal the full functionality of caveolae and other caveo - lin - positive membranes .

Through - focus series of 10 – 12 optical slices were collected and deconvolved using a Deltavision RT deconvolution microscope ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA , USA ) . Pearson coefﬁcients were determined using the colocalization algorithm of either the Deltavision RT software or Imaris . Images presented in Figures 1 , 3 – 5 and 7 were sharpened and contrast enhanced using Adobe Photoshop . Normal human tissues were ﬁxed in 10 % formalin buffered in phosphate and then embedded in parafﬁn . Parafﬁn sections ( 5mm thick ) were de - waxed in three changes of xylene ( 10min each ) and rehydrated into buffer A . The sections were washed with buffer A containing 50mM NH 4 Cl for 30min and blocked by incubation for 30min with buffer B containing 10 % ( v / v ) normal goat serum and 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin . For double immunoﬂuorescence staining , mAb hSRBC IgG ( 1 : 200 dilution ) with rabbit anti - Cav1 ( 10 m g / ml ) or non - immune mouse IgG ( 1 : 200 dilution ) or non - immune rabbit IgG ( 10 m g / ml ) was applied to the coverslips overnight at 4 1 C . The sections were washed three times in buffer B containing 0 . 1 % BSA . Bound primary antibody was detected by incubation for 2h with Alexa - Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 10 m g / ml ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) and Alexa - Fluor 568 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 10 m g / ml ) . The tissues slides were washed three times in buffer B containing 0 . 1 % BSA , rinsed with water and mounted under a coverslip with Fluorescence Mounting Medium ( Dako , Carpinteria , CA ) . Images were taken using Leica TCS SP confocal microscope . For EM analysis , cells were processed for indirect immunogold detection of hSRBC ( Li et al , 2001 ) . Human ﬁbroblasts were cultured in 100 - mm dishes to 95 % conﬂuence and immersion - ﬁxed in freshly prepared buffer C for 60min . The cells were enclosed in 2 % ( w / v ) agar and then infused in 2M sucrose containing 15 % ( w / v ) polyvinylpyrrolidone ( 10kDa ) . Frozen ultrathin sections were prepared using a Leica Ultracut UCTultramicrotome equipped with a Leica EMFCS cryochamber . The sections were lifted onto nickel grids with infused solution and stored overnight on gelatin at SRBC / cavin - 3 regulates caveolae function K - A McMahon et al & 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 28 | NO 8 | 2009 1013 4 1 C . Before immunolabelling , the gelatin was liqueﬁed at 37 1 C , and the nickel grids were removed . We washed the sections by ﬂoating them on droplets of buffer A . For immunogold localization , the grids with the attached thin sections were conditioned on droplets of buffer A containing 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin , 0 . 01 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 and 0 . 01 % ( v / v ) Tween - 20 for 10min at room temperature . The grids were incubated for 2h in the presence of mouse monoclonal anti - SRBC IgG ( 1 : 50 dilution ) in buffer A with 0 . 5 % BSA . The sections were rinsed on droplets of buffer A and then incubated with 5 - nm gold - labelled goat anti - mouse IgG ( diluted 1 : 40 ; Amersham Biosciences UK Limited , Little Chalfont , Buckinghamshire , UK ) in buffer Awith 0 . 5 % BSA . Finally , the grids with the attached thin sections were rinsed in buffer A , ﬁxed with buffer A containing 2 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde for 10min and positive contrast stained ( Takizawa and Robinson , 2003 ) . Electron micro - graphs were taken using a JEOL 1200 electron microscope operating at 80kV . Electrophoresis and immunoblotting Each sample was concentrated by TCA precipitation and washed in acetone . Pellets were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer ( Laemmli , 1970 ) , heated at 95 1 C for 5min and loaded onto 10 % SDS – PAGE . The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . The membrane was blocked in buffer G for 1h at room temperature . Primary antibodies were diluted in buffer I and incubated with the membrane for 1h at room temperature . The membrane was washed three times for 3min each in buffer J and incubated with the appropriate HRP - labelled anti - IgG in buffer I for 1h at room temperature . The membrane was then washed , and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ( Amersham Biosciences UK ) . Immunoprecipitation SV589 human ﬁbroblasts were lysed in buffer E plus 150 NaCl for 30min at 4 1 C . Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 1 C with the indicated antibody and protein A - Sepharose CL - 4B beads ( 500 m g of protein ; 5 m g of IgG ; 50 m l of beads ) . Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer E containing an additional 250mM NaCl , twice with buffer E plus 150mM NaCl and twice in buffer F . Proteins were eluted from beads with SDS sample buffer , separated by SDS – PAGE , transferred to PVDF membrane and blotted with the indicated antibodies . Spinning disc confocal microscopy hSRBC – tdTomato was made by inserting hSRBC into the Hin dIII / Eco RI cut site and tdTomato into the Xho I / Xba I cut site of pCDNA3 . 1 / V5 - His A mammalian expression vector ( Invitrogen ) . Cav1 – GFP was constructed as described previously ( Mundy et al , 2002 ) . The cells were plated in glass - bottomed 35 - mm dishes ( MatTek Corporation , Ashland , MA ) and co - transfected with Cav1 – GFP and hSRBC – tdTomato using Fugene ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . At 24 – 48h after transfection , ﬂuores - cence time - lapse recordings were made at (cid:3) 63 with a spinning disc confocal microscope ( Ultraview ERS ; Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA ) using 488 - and 568 - nm laser lines for excitation and the appropriate band - pass ﬁlters to separate the two ﬂuorescence signals . The samples were maintained at 37 1 C using a stage - mounted heater and an objective heater ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging , Thornwood , NY ) . FRAP analysis For FRAP , the cells were plated in glass - bottomed 35 - mm dishes ( MatTek Corporation ) . HeLa cells transfected with Cav1 – GFP were used for the drug treatment experiments . To examine the role of hSRBC in caveolae trafﬁcking , non - small cell lung carcinoma cells ( H358 , H460 and H1299 ) , which express Cav1 but not hSRBC as determined by western blotting ( Sunaga et al , 2004 ; Xu et al , 2001 ) , were obtained from the Hamon Center Collection . The cells were transfected with empty vector and Cav1 – GFP cDNA or with WT - SRBC and Cav1 – GFP using Fugene ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 18h , after which the medium was changed to CO 2 - independent medium ( cat . no . 18045088 ; Gibco BRL , Grand Island , NY , USA ) . Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging ) . Cells were maintained at 37 1 C using a stage - mounted heating unit . HeLa cells transfected with Cav1 – GFP were left untreated as a control or were treated with 1 m M nocodazole ( Sigma ) or 20 m M genistein ( Calbio - chem , San Diego , CA , USA ) for 1h at 37 1 C . For FRAP , a region of interest containing everything within the boundary of the cell was deﬁned in a single focal plane and ﬂuorescence within the region was bleached with a 488nm laser line at full power for 30 iterations ( about 25s ) . Z - stacks taken before and after bleaching showed that this protocol typically results in bleaching of ﬂuorescence through - out the thickness of the cell . Recovery was recorded for an additional 150s after photobleaching at time intervals of 1s . For the analysis of recovery , a region of interest near the centrosome was deﬁned and the number of GFP - positive particles in this region was analysed for each frame of the time - lapse sequence using the automated spot detection algorithm of Imaris software , setting the minimum particle diameter to 0 . 2 m m and choosing an intensity threshold ( typically o 20 ) that minimized the number of particles in the ﬁrst frame after photobleaching . The particle number in the ﬁrst frame after photobleaching was taken as the baseline . Data from 10 cells were combined and the average particle number above baseline in each frame was plotted against frame number . Mass spectrometry For proteins that co - precipitated with the WT hSRBC construct and not with an hSRBC construct lacking the LZ ( amino acids 22 – 70 ) , the corresponding silver - stained bands were excised from the gel slab . Each protein band was cut into 1 - mm pieces , and destained in 25mM NH 4 HCO 3 , 50 % methanol , 50 % water three times for 10min . They were washed with equal volumes of 10 % acetic acid , 50 % methanol , 40 % water three times for 1h , and swollen in water twice for 20min . The gel pieces were dehydrated with ACN and dried in SpeedVac ( Thermo Savant , Holbrook , NY , USA ) . The gel pieces were again rehydrated with modiﬁed porcine trypsin ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) at a concentration of 10ng / ml in 50mM NH 4 HCO 3 and then subjected to trypsin proteolytic digestion at 37 1 C overnight . Tryptic peptides were sequentially extracted with an equal volume mixture of 50 % ACN , 45 % water and 5 % TFA followed by an equal volume mixture of 75 % ACN , 24 . 9 % water and 0 . 1 % TFA . The peptide extracts were combined and dried in SpeedVac . The peptide samples were cleaned with ZipTip C18 ( Millipore ) prior to HPLC - MS / MS analysis . HPLC - MS / MS analysis and protein sequence identiﬁcation were performed as described previously ( McMahon et al , 2006 ) .
