Engelmann @ med . uni - muenchen . de Table of Contents : Supplementary Methods Supplementary Figures 2 Supplementary Methods Hepatocyte isolation To isolate mouse hepatocytes , the hepatic artery was perfused with EBSS ( without Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + ) , followed by infusion of EBSS ( with Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + ) containing collagenase ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) and aprotinin ( 0 . 1 μg / ml ) . The liver was removed , the capsule was cut with a scalpel and the separated cells were resuspended in EBSS ( without Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + ) and centrifuged . The pelleted cells were examined for viability and cell specificity and seeded onto µ - dishes ( Ibidi ) in Williams’medium E ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 10 % FCS ) . Bacterial survival in vitro Cells were incubated with Listeria ( MOI 10 ) in different media and then incubated with media containing gentamicin ( 10 μg / ml , 15 - 60 min ) in the presence or , in some cases , absence ( MβCD ) of FBS ( 10 % ) . In other cases , macrophages were treated after the internalization period ( 30 min ) with DMSO ( control ) , wortmannin ( 100 nM ) or 3 - MA ( 10 mM ) to inhibit autophagy . The time intervals given refer to the total time period from the start of coincubation of cells with bacteria until the end of incubation with gentamicin . Following incubation with gentamicin , the cells were washed , lysed with Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 2 % ) and cfus were measured in the cell lysates . Control experiments with labeled Listeria indicated that after the incubation with gentamicin no bacteria adhered to the extracellular surface of the cell membrane . Detection of membrane areas with increased cholesterol contents Localization of cholesterol - rich domains was analyzed using perfringolysin O ( theta toxin , BC  , provided by Yoshiko Ohno - Iwashita , Iwaki , Japan ) . The toxin was digested with subtilisin Carlsberg and biotinylated ( Waheed , A . A . et al . 2001 ) . To determine local cholesterol accumulation in the plasma membrane , wt and hSR - BI + cells were incubated for 3 45 min with BC  ( 15 µg / ml , 4°C ) . BC  and SR - BI were visualized under confocal microscope using PE - labeled anti - biotin antibody ( BioLegend ) and anti - SR - BI antibody ( 1 : 200 , Novus ) detected with Alexa488 - labeled anti - rabbit IgG . For labeling of intracellular compartments , the cells were incubated for another 10 min at 37°C . To assess colocalization of the domains with SR - BI in intracellular compartments , cells were permeabilized using saponin . In other experiments , we used the perfringolysin - O - domain 4 - GFP construct ( PFO / D4 - GFP , donated by B . Mutus , Windsor , Canada ) to identify cholesterol - enriched membrane domains . Cells were incubated for 45 min PFO / D4 - GFP ( 20 µg / ml , 4°C ) . For labeling of intracellular compartments , the cells were first incubated for 45 min with PFO / D4 - GFP ( 20 µg / ml , 4°C ) . Unbound toxin was removed by washing and the cells were incubated for another 10 min at room temperature . The plasma membrane was labeled with FM 4 - 64FX . To detect lipid bodies , after a 30 min preincubation ( with or without MβCD ) , macrophages were stained with BODIPY493 / 503 ( 10 µg / ml , 30 min , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and in parallel with FM 4 - 64FX . To prevent formation of lipid bodies , cells were preincubated with C75 ( 24 h , Sigma ) , an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) . Immunoelectron microscopy We fixed wt and hSR - BI + CHO cells in PFA ( 2 % ) and glutaraldehyde ( 0 . 2 % ) ( in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) ) . The cells were infiltrated in sucrose ( 2 . 3 M ) and frozen in liquid nitrogen . 50 - 60 nm - thick sections were cut at - 120°C using an Ultracut S ( Leica ) equipped with an antistatic device ( Diatome ) and a diamond knife ( Drukker ) . Sections were collected on formvar - coated grids using methylcellulose ( 1 . 8 % ) and sucrose ( 2 . 3 M ) . Immunogold double labeling experiments were conducted on thin frozen sections using 10 and 15 nm gold particles . After labeling , sections were fixed with glutaraldehyde ( 1 % ) , counterstained for 5 min with uranyl - oxalate ( pH 7 . 0 ) , washed , and embedded in a mixture of methylcellulose ( 1 . 8 % ) and uranyl acetate ( 0 . 3 % , 4°C ) . The sections were viewed with a JEOL 1200EX 4 electron microscope . Localization of cholesterol - enriched membrane domains was performed using biotinylated BC  . For detection of plasma membrane cholesterol , cells were incubated with BC  for 45 min ( 15 µg / ml , 4°C ) . To visualize intracellular cholesterol accumulation , we incubated the cells for another 10 min ( 37°C ) . BC  was detected on ultra - thin cryosections using anti - biotin antibody ( Sanver Tech ) and protein A - gold 10 nm . SR - BI was viewed with anti - SR - BI antibody ( Abcam ) and protein A - gold 15 nm . Immunohistochemistry For filipin staining , we thawed freeze - dried tissue sections and rehydrated them in PBS for 30 min . The sections were incubated with primary anti - pan cadherin antibody ( 1 : 100 , Abcam ) to selectively stain plasma membranes and were then treated with Alexa543 - labeled secondary antibody ( 1 : 400 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and filipin ( 25 µg / ml , Sigma ) . Tissue samples were mounted with glycerol and observed by confocal microscopy . 5 Supplementary Figures Supplementary Fig . 1 | Tissue cholesterol distribution and protection from organ damage during bacterial infection .
