Midzone Microtubule Bundles Are Continuously Required for Cytokinesis in Cultured Epithelial Cells Sally P . Wheatley and Yu - li Wang Cell Biology Group , Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research , Shrewsbury , Massachusetts 01545 Abstract . The current model of cytokinesis proposes that spindle poles and associated microtubules deter - mine the cleavage plane , and , once the signal has been delivered to the cortex , the entire mitotic apparatus can be removed without affecting cell division . While sup - ported by compelling data from Echinoderm embryos , recent observations suggest that the model may not be universally applicable . In this study , we have examined the relationship ( s ) among microtubules , chromosomes , and cleavage activity in living normal rat kidney ( NRK ) cells with multipolar mitotic figures . We found that cleavage activity correlated with the distribution of midzone microtubule bundles and Telophase Disc 60 protein ( TD60 ) rather than the position of spindle poles . In addition , reduction of midzone microtubules near the cortex , by either nocodazole treatment or spontaneous reorganization in tripolar cells , caused in - hibition or regression of furrowing . These results dem - onstrate that continuous interaction between midzone microtubule bundles and the cortex is required for suc - cessful cleavage in tissue culture cells . C YTOKINESIS , the final stage in cell division , is a tightly regulated process ( for reviews see Mabu - chi , 1986 ; Salmon , 1989 ; Satterwhite and Pollard , 1992 ; Fishkind and Wang , 1995 ) . It normally occurs only after chromosome separation , along a plane perpendicular to the spindle axis and equidistant between the segregated chromosomes . Past observations have provided strong evi - dence that the cleavage plane is dictated by the position of the mitotic apparatus ( MA ) 1 or , more specifically , by the spindle poles ( Rappaport , 1961 ; Rappaport and Ebstein , 1965 ; Rappaport , 1985 ; for reviews see Rappaport , 1991 ; Strome , 1993 ) . The most elegant demonstration involved manipulation of a sand dollar egg into a horseshoe shape with one spindle located in each arm ( Rappaport , 1961 ) . In addition to cleavage at the spindle midplanes , division occurred between the asters without intervening chromo - somes . Such convincing studies from Echinoderm eggs have led to a general view that the spindle poles represent the key cleavage plane determinant in all animal cells ( for reviews see Mabuchi , 1986 ; Rappaport , 1991 ) . Further - more , as the spindle poles are distant from the cortex , the anaphase astral microtubulesrare proposed to transmit the cleavage signal to the cortex ( Schroeder , 1981 ; White and Borisy , 1983 ; Rappaport and Rappaport , 1988 ; Harris and Gewalt , 1989 ; Devore et al . , 1989 ; Rappaport , 1991 ) .

A second widely held view is that there is a narrow time window in which the cleavage signal is transmitted to the cortex ( Hamaguchi , 1975 ; Rappaport and Rappaport , 1993 ) , and once the signal is received , the entire MA can be dis - carded without any consequence to the ensuing division ( Swann and Mitchison , 1953 ; Hiramoto , 1956 ) . In these early works , however , it was difficult to ascertain whether all microtubules had been removed . Moreover , there are indications that the structural organization and regulation of cytokinesis vary substantially between cell types : while the MA of marine invertebrate eggs has extensive asters and a small central spindle , mammalian cells in monolayer culture have a comparatively large spindle , large chromo - somes , and small asters . In cultured cells , the interzonal microtubules that develop between the separating chro - mosomes during anaphase are the microtubules closest to the cortex , and various observations have implicated them in stimulating cleavage ( Kawamura , 1977 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ; Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . Even in Echinoderm eggs , ar - tificially bringing the cortex near the central spindle can stimulate cleavage ( Rappaport and Rappaport , 1974 ) , im - plying that the ability to induce cleavage is not limited to astral microtubules . Surprisingly , despite the consensus that microtubules play an important role in stimulating cytokinesis , few ob - servations have been made to characterize directly the re - lationship between microtubule organization and cleavage ( Asnes and Schroeder , 1979 ; Wadsworth and Stoboda , 1983 ; Hamaguchi et al . , 1985 ; Conrad et al . , 1992 ; Oka et al . , 1994 ; Fishkind et al . , 1996 ) . Most informative would be a detailed knowledge of microtubule organization in various alternative forms of cytokinesis , e . g . , in cells with multiple • The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 96 / 11 / 981 / 9 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , Number 4 , November 1996 981 - 989 981 spindle poles ( Ghosh and Paweletz , 1984 ) . Here we report that the location of the cleavage plane correlates more di - rectly with the position of midzone microtubules than the spindle poles or polar microtubules . Moreover , we show that the persistence of midzone microtubule organization is essential for successful completion of cleavage in these cells . Materials and Methods Culture and Treatment of Normal Rat Kidney ( NRK ) Cells Two subclones ( NRK2 and 13 ) of NRK - 52E epithelial cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) , selected for their spread mor - phology during division , were cultured on glass chamber dishes as de - scribed previously ( McKenna and Wang , 1989 ) . Multipolar spindles were generated by colcemid treatment ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ; Ghosh and Paweletz , 1984 ; Keryer et al . , 1984 ; Sellitto and Kuriyama , 1988 ) or polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - induced fusion ( PEG 1500 ; BDH Lab Supplies , Lanerworth , UK ; Davidson and Gerald , 1976 ) . For colcemid treatment , low density cultures were grown ( 24 - 48 h ) and then incubated in medium containing 0 . 04 I ~ g / ml colcemid . After 24 h , cells were washed thoroughly with fresh medium and allowed 48 h to recover . For PEG - in - duced fusion , cells were grown until large colonies formed ( 48 h ) , the me - dium was then removed , and cells were bathed in 1 ml warm PEG 1500 ( 50 % wt / vol , in DME ; 37°C ) for 60 s . Cells were then rinsed gently but thoroughly with warm DME containing 15 % DMSO ( Sigma Chemical Co . ; Lewis and AIbrecht - Buehler , 1987 ) and then allowed > 24 h to re - cover in growth medium , F12K ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( JRH Biosciences , Lenexa , KS ) , before experimentation . Cells were treated , at the stages indicated , with 2 . 5 IxM nocodazole or 10 I ~ M cytochalasin B ( both from Sigma Chemical Co . ) diluted directly into warm medium from DMSO stocks held at - 20°C . Preparation and Microinjection of Rhodamine - Tubulin Twice - cycled bovine brain tubulin , a gift from Dr . C . Wilkerson ( Worces - ter Foundation for Biomedical Research , Shrewsbury , MA ) , was prepared by the method of Williams and Lee ( 1982 ) and stored as droplets at - 80°C . Tubulin was labeled with tetramethyl rhodamine succinimidyl es - ter ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) as described by Sammak and Borisy ( 1988 ) . Rhodamine - tubulin was drop - frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen at a concentration of 8 - 12 mg / ml in microinjection buffer ( 50 mM potassium glutamate , 0 . 5 M MgCI2 , pH 6 . 5 ~ i . 7 ) and then diluted to 4 - 6 mg / ml immediately before use . The molar ratio of conjugated rhodamine to tubulin dimer was 1 . 5 , based on rhodamine absorption at 550 nm , an ex - tinction coefficient of 50 , 000 , and protein concentration assay ( Lowry et al . , 1951 ) . Microinjection was performed by continuous flow using custom drawn glass needles ( Kopf Vertical Pipette Puller 720 ; Kopf Instruments , Tujunga , CA ) fitted to a custom - designed pressure control system mounted on a micromanipulator ( Leica , Inc . , Deerfield , I1 ) as described by Wang ( 1992 ) . Immunofluorescence and Phalloidin Staining All fixatives were prepared in warm cytoskeleton buffer ( 137 mM NaCI , 5 mM KCI , 1 . 1 mM Na2HPO4 , 0 . 4 mM KH2PO4 , 2 mM MgCI2 , 2 mM EGTA , 5 mM Pipes , 5 . 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 1 ; Small , 1981 ; Small et al . , 1982 ) . Cells were rinsed with warm PBS before fixation . For optimal pres - ervation of microtubules and F - actin , cells were immersed for 1 min in 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Polysciences Inc . , Warring ! on , PA ) with 0 . 15 % Tri - ton X - 100 , rinsed thoroughly in cytoskeleton buffer , and postfixed for 10 min in 1 % glutaraldehyde ( Small , 1981 ; Small et al . , 1982 ) . Cells were again washed in cytoskeleton buffer and then incubated for 5 min in 0 . 5 % sodium borohydride . For best preservation of CHO1 and Telophase Disc 60 protein ( TD60 ) antigens , cells were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde ( EM Sciences , Gibbstown , NJ ) plus 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10 rain , or with 4 % formaldehyde for 10 rain and then extracted in - 20°C acetone for 5 rain . Fixed cells were rinsed with cytoskeletal buffer and then blocked for > 20 min with 1 % BSA in PBS ( Boehringer Mannheim Corp . , Indianapolis , IN ) . Antibodies were diluted in 1 % BSA / PBS and clarified in a microcentri - fuge before use . Primary antibodies : human JH autoimmune serum against TD60 ( kindly provided by Dr . D . Palmer , University of Washington , Seat - tle , WA ; 1 / 50 dilution ) ; monoclonal anti - 13 tubulin ( Amersham Corp . , Ar - lington Heights , IL ; 1 / I0 dilution ) ; and monoclonal antimitotic kinesin - like protein ( CHO1 ; kindly provided by Dr . R . Kuriyama , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN ; 1 / 500 dilution ) . All antibody incubations were performed for 1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C . Secondary antibodies : FITC - anti - human IgG ( a kind gift from R . Balczon , University of South Alabama , Mobile , AL ; for TD60 , 1 / 20 dilution ) ; FITC - sheep anti - mouse IgG ( Sigma Chemical Co . ; for tubulin , 1 / 50 dilution ) ; and rhodamine B - goat anti - mouse IgG and IgM ( TAGO Inc . , Burlingame , CA ; for CHO1 ; 1 / 50 dilution ) . Finally , cells were rinsed and mounted in PBS or antibleaching medium ( 100 mg / ml DABCO Sigma Chemical Co . , 1 mg / ml n - propyl gal - late Sigma Chemical Co . , 80 % glycerol , 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 ) . Phalloidin staining was performed by incubation for 1 h at room tem - perature with 200 nM TRITC - phalloidin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) or FITC - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) diluted in PBS . Microscopy and Data Collection Cells were viewed using an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 10 ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) with a 40× , NA 0 . 75 , plan - achroplan phase con - trast lens , a 63x , NA 1 . 30 , Neofluar phase lens , or a 100× , NA 1 . 30 Neo - fluar lens . Fluorescence was detected using epifluorescent optics and cooled CCD camera ( TE / CCD - 576EM ; Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) . Images were processed by subtraction of camera dark noise and filed using custom designed computer software . Hard copies were prepared on a Kodak Color Ease PS Printer ( Rochester , NY ) . Results The incidence of spontaneous binucleation in NRK cells is ~ 0 . 7 % ( n = 1 , 000 ) . Multinucleation increased dramati - cally after transient treatment with colcemid ( 23 % ; n = 1 , 000 ) or PEG - induced fusion ( 3 % ; n = 2 , 000 ) . While most experiments were performed on colcemid - treated cells , consistent results were obtained with spontaneous or PEG - fused cells . Chromosome movement and cleavage pattern were monitored by time - lapse phase imaging and , after microin - jection of rhodamine - tubulin , microtubule and spindle pole dynamics were monitored with epifluorescence . As cytokinesis in adherent cells does not always occur by lat - eral ingression of the cell margins , cleavage activity was also assessed by F - actin accumulation after fixation and staining with fluorescent phalloidin ( Fishkind and Wang , 1993 ) . Cleavage Pattern Varies with the Configuration of Chromosomes Upon entry into prophase , multinucleated cells typically had four or more centrosomes with associated microtu - bules . These centrosomes tended to migrate and merge during prometaphase ( see Fig . 3 B and D , arrowheads ) . By metaphase , the majority of multipolar spindles consisted of three poles connected by microtubules to a common set of chromosomes . We focused our attention on spindles with pole - pole and pole to cell boundary distances compa - rable to those seen in cleaving bipolar cells . The metaphase plates of tripolar cells were typically " Y " - ( Fig . 1 A , / ) or " V " - shaped ( Fig . 1 , B and C , / ) . Among cells with a Y - shaped metaphase plate ( n = 37 ) , 50 % underwent a symmetrical mitosis and divided into three parts while the other 50 % cleaved into two ( de - scribed below ) . Cells with a V - shaped metaphase plate also divided into two or three daughters . The pattern of cleavage appeared to depend on the sharpness of the angle The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 982 Figure 1 . Chromosomes are arranged into a " Y " ( A ) , shallow " V " ( B ) , or sharp " V " ( C ) shape at metaphase , shown as phase images ( / ) and schematically in ( 1 / ) . Progression through anaphase ( III ) to cleavage ( IV ) is illustrated for each . Chromosomes are represented by thick black lines , spindle poles as black dots , and cleavage as invaginations of the cell outline . Dashed lines ( 111 ) indicate the predicted cleavage sites if determined by the position of the metaphase plate . In 50 % of cells with a Y configuration ( A ) , one furrow fails due to the rearrangement of midzone microtubules ( IV , lower figure ; see also Fig . 5 ) . Cells with a shallow V configuration ( B ) always cleave into two ( B , IV ) , whereas cells with a sharp V divide into three ( C , IV ) . Bar , 10 i ~ m . between the chromosomes : cells with a sharp V ( range ~ 70 ° to 125 ° ) typically divided into three ( n = 9 / 11 ) , while those with a shallow V ( range N125 ° to 180 ° ) always divided into two ( n = 24 / 24 ) . Cleavage pattern in relation to chro - mosome organization is summarized in Fig . 1 ( II - IV ) . Cleavage Plane Is Defined by the Position of the Midzone Microtubules Cells with shallow V - shaped metaphase plates appeared to divide in a pattern contradicting that predicted by Echino - derm experiments ( Rappaport , 1961 ) and thus were exam - ined in detail with microinjected rhodamine - tubulin . In this configuration , two pairs of poles had intervening chro - mosomes while the third had chromosomes only on one side ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Arrays of midzone microtubules started to form in the expanding midzones during anaphase ( Figs . 2 , D and F , and 3 F ) and subsequently developed into discrete bundles ( Figs . 2 , H and J , and 3 H ) . By con - trast , between the two poles without intervening chromo - somes ( Figs . 2 F and 3 H , poles b and c ) , microtubule bun - dles were either absent ( Fig . 2 F ) or present only to a limited extent ( Fig . 3 H , arrow ) . In such cells , cleavage ac - tivity was only apparent along the two planes defined by the midzone microtubules ( n = 24 / 24 ) , as judged by in - gression of the lateral margins ( Figs . 2 , G - J ) or by F - actin organization ( Fig . 3 I ) . In some cases , a short band of cleavage activity was found between the poles without in - tervening chromosomes ( Fig . 3 / ) . This region , however , always contained a small band of bundled microtubules in - terconnecting the neighboring chromosomes ( Fig . 3 H , ar - FOW ) . In addition to the midzone microtubules , numerous po - lar microtubules extended throughout the cell during late anaphase ( Fig . 3 H ) . The distribution of their plus ends , however , showed no defined relationship to cleavage , un - less incorporated into a midzone region as seen in cells with a sharp V ( Fig . 4 D , arrow ) . These results suggest that determination of the cleavage plane is governed by the lo - cation of the metaphase plate and midzone microtubules .

The cell was injected at prometaphase with rhodamine - tubulin ( B ) . As anaphase progressed ( C - F ) , interzonal microtubules developed between two pairs of poles ( F ; a and b , and a and c ) but not between the third pair ( F ; b and c ) . Cleavage , visible by ingression ( G and / ) , occurred only where midzone microtubule bundles were present ( H and J ) . Bar , 10 ixm . Continued Presence of Midzone Microtubule Bundles Is Required for Successful Cleavage To assess the role of microtubules after cleavage stimula - tion , we microinjected rhodamine - tubulin into symmetri - cal tripolar ceils with Y - shaped metaphase plates ( Fig . 5 ) . Microtubule organization was then compared between ceils that divided into three equal parts and those that di - vided into two parts of differing size . In the former ( Fig . 5 , Figure 3 . Cleavage activity and microtubule dynamics in a tripo - lar NRK cell with a shallow V - shaped metaphase plate . The cell was injected during prometaphase ( A ) with rhodamine - tubulin ( B ) and monitored as it progressed through anaphase onset ( C and D ) , anaphase ( E and F ) to telophase ( G and H ) . The cell was then fixed and stained with FITC - phalloidin ( / ) to reveal F - actin accumulation as a marker for cleavage activity . Multiple spindle poles were apparent during metaphase ( B , arrowheads ) . By anaphase onset these had converged into three functional spindle poles ( D , arrows ) with prominent kinetochore microtubule bun - dles emanating towards the chromosomes . The chromosomes split into three groups ( C , E , and G ) and arrays of interzonal mi - crotubules developed in the midzones ( F and H ) . Among the three functional spindle poles ( H , a , b , and c ) , two were equiva - lent ( a and b , and a and c ) , containing a normal configuration of intervening chromosomes and typical midzone microtubule bun - dies . The third pair ( b and c ) had chromosomes only on one side , with a small number of microtubule bundles located between the two sets of chromosomes ( H , arrow ) . F - actin localization ( / ) re - flected closely the organization of midzone microtubules . Bar , 10 ~ tm . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 984 Figure 4 . Cleavage of a tripolar NRK cell with a sharp V - shaped metaphase plate . The cell was injected at prometaphase with rhodamine - tubulin . Despite the absence of shared metaphase chromosomes between one pair of poles ( compare A and B ) , three cleavage planes developed ( C ) . Cleavage was accompanied by the formation of midzone microtubule bundles between each pair of poles including the pair with no intervening chromosomes ( D , arrow ) . Bar , 10 I ~ m . A - D ) , both the distribution of chromosomes and the orga - nization of the midzone microtubules maintained a three - fold symmetry throughout mitosis and cytokinesis ( n = 19 / 37 ) . By contrast , in the latter ( Fig . 5 , A ' - D ' ) , the distribu - tion of midzone microtubules became progressively asym - metric as bundles from one branch of the tripolar spindle merged into the other two branches ( n = 18 / 37 ) . Cleavage occurred only where midzone microtubule bundles were present ( Fig . 5 , D ' , arrow ) . We then asked whether cytokinesis could continue in normal bipolar cells after microtubule disruption . Com - pared to interphase and polar microtubules , midzone mi - crotubule bundles are more resilient to depolymerizing agents ; this resilience increases as cells progress through division . To monitor the distribution of residual microtu - bules in relation to cleavage , cells were injected with rhodamine - tubulin before treatment with nocodazole . When all microtubule bundles were removed from the cortical vicinity ( n = 14 / 19 ) , cleavage was inhibited . Moreover , in - gressing furrows regressed ( n = 5 ) when all microtubule bundles were removed from near the cortex ( Fig . 6 ) . On the other hand , if some microtubules remained in close prox - imity to the cortex after treatment ( n = 5 / 19 ) , cleavage completed with the active margin located adjacent to the residual microtubules . To determine whether midzone microtubule bundle for - mation was a cause or effect of furrowing , we applied cy - tochalasin B to cells in late metaphase and anaphase ( n = 10 ) . Despite the inhibition of cleavage , microtubule bun - dles formed normally , although they never compacted into a midbody ( see also Schroeder , 1970 ; Martineau et al . , 1995 ) . Relationship between Cleavage and the Distribution of Spindle Midzone Proteins A number of microtubule - and chromosome - associated proteins have been implicated in stimulating cytokinesis based on their relocation to the midzone during telophase ( for reviews see Rattner , 1992 ; Earnshaw and Mackay , 1994 ) . We examined the distribution of two such proteins : mitotic kinesin - like protein identified by CHO1 antibody ( Sellitto and Kuriyama , 1988 ) , and TD60 recognized by a human autoimmune serum ( Andreassen et al . , 1991 ) . CHO1 staining varied among furrows , with no detectable concentration found in ~ 10 % of the actively cleaving re - gions ( n = 13 / 115 ) . By contrast , TD60 distribution paral - leled that of F - actin and midzone microtubules ( n = 115 / 115 ) in all multipolar cells ( Fig . 7 ) . In cells with a shallow V configuration , neither TD60 nor F - actin was found be - tween pairs of poles with no intervening chromosomes ( Fig . 7 , A ' - C ' ) . However , both were abundantly present in the region occupied by midzone microtubule bundles , suggesting that TD60 is likely involved in the stimulation of cleavage . Discussion The classic view of cytokinesis is derived primarily from experiments with Echinoderm eggs . Although these large cells are amenable to manipulations , their size also ob - structs precise observation of cytoskeletal architecture ( Asnes and Schroeder , 1979 ; Wadsworth and Sloboda , 1983 ; Hamaguchi et al . , 1985 ; Oka et al . , 1994 ) . In addi - tion , they are morphologically distinct from somatic cells and may not be as prototypic as biologists first anticipated . In this study , we induced multipolarity in well - spread mammalian epithelial ( NRK ) cells . The favorable optical quality of these cells , together with the abnormal mitotic configurations , allowed us to probe the relationships among cleavage , microtubules , spindle poles , and chromosomes . The Roles of Spindle Poles and Microtubules in Cleavage Stimulation While the currently favored model of cytokinesis empha - sizes the importance of the spindle poles in stimulating cleavage ( Rappaport , 1991 ) , it has also been speculated that microtubules probably play a more direct role ( De - yore et al . , 1989 ; Harris and Gewalt , 1989 ) . In this study , we first asked whether a pair of poles with associated microtubules is sufficient to stimulate cleavage as originally proposed for Echinoderm eggs . We found that the cleavage plane is not determined solely by the or - ganization of the spindle poles , as tripolar cells with a shal - low V - shaped metaphase plate always divide into two ( Fig . 1 B , IV ) , whereas most cells with a sharp V divide into three . Furthermore , by monitoring microtubule dynamics in living cells , we found a strong correlation between Wheatley and Wang Midzone Microtubules in Cytokinesis 985 Figure 5 . Midzone microtu - bule dynamics in relation to cleavage . Spontaneously formed tripolar cells were in - jected at prometaphase with rhodamine - tubulin and ob - served as they completed cell division ( judged by midbody formation ) . In the first series ( A - D ) , the cell exhibited threefold symmetry in the or - ganization of its microtu - bules and spindle poles as it progressed from metaphase ( A ) , through anaphase ( B ) , to telophase ( C ) . Ultimately , this cell divided into three equal portions ( D ) . By con - trast , in the second series ( A ' - D ' ) the threefold sym - metry apparent at metaphase ( A ' ) was lost as microtubule bundles between the top two spindle poles relocated to other regions during ana - phase and telophase ( B ' and C ' ) . No furrowing was ob - served in this region , and the cell cleaved into two un - equal parts ( D ' , arrow indi - cates the direction of furrow - ing ) . Bar , 10 i ~ m . cleavage and midzone microtubules : cleavage only oc - curred near regions populated by midzone microtubule bundles , which are comprised primarily of overlapping in - terzonal microtubules ( Saxton and McIntosh , 1987 ; Mas - tronarde et al . , 1993 ) . These observations suggest that , in cultured mammalian cells , midzone microtubules play a more direct role in stimulating cytokinesis than other parts of the MA . Midzone Microtubules Are Continuously Required for Cytokinesis in NRK Cells It is widely held that after cortical stimulation , the entire MA , including chromosomes and associated microtubules , can be removed without any consequence to the develop - ing furrow . This was shown first by colchicine treatment ( Swann and Mitchison , 1953 ) and later by aspirating the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 986 Figure 6 . Effects of nocodaz01e on midzone bundles and cleav - age after the initiation of furrowing . A cleaving bipolar NRK cell ( A ) was treated with 2 . 5 ILM n0codazole ( B ) and viewed after 20 min incubation ( C ) . All microtubules were removed from the vi - cinity of cell cortex ( C ' ) and the cleavage furrow regressed ( C ) . Bar , 10 p . m . MA of a sea urchin egg during anaphase ( Hiramoto , 1956 ) ; in each case , cytokinesis completed in the absence of the MA . It is possible , however , that in either experi - ment , some microtubules remained associated with the cortex and provided continuous stimulation . Indeed , after initiation of furrowing in sand dollar eggs , the cleavage plane can be relocated by moving the MA ( Rappaport , 1985 ) . Our experiments with nocodazote indicate that , al - though cytokinesis can occur after disassembly of a . large portion of microtubules during anaphase , the process con - tinues only where midzone microtubule bundles remain in sufficient number or in Close proximity to the cortex . Even after initiation of cytokinesis , furrowing can be reversed if all midzone microtubule bundles near the cortex are elimi - nated ( Fig . 6 ) . These Observations may explain the vari - able response of dividing PtK1 cells to nocodazole treat - ment ( Mullins and Snyder , 1981 ) . Further evidence comes from cells with Y - shaped meta - phase plates . Cleavage fails and the cell divides into two unequal parts if microtubules from one midzone become incorporated into the other midzones ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus , con - trary to the current opinion , cleavage progression and completion appear to require continuous interaction of the cortex with a subset of microtubules . This finding is in - dependently supported by two recent studies . First , in snail eggs , regression of polar lobes correlated with micro - tubule loss and persistent furrowing correlated with taxol stabilization of microtubules ( Conrad et al . , 1992 ) . Second , during recovery of HeLa cells from dihydrocytochalasin B treatment , the ability of cells to cleave appeared to be de - termined by the retention of a " postmitotic spindle , " com - prised of interzonal microtubules and the TD60 protein ( Martineau et al . , 1995 ; discussed below ) . The Roles of Chromosomes and Spindle Midzone Proteins in Cytokinesis Chromosomes are generally thought to play no active part in mitosis or cytokinesis ( Zhang and Nicl ~ las , 1996 ) . How - ever , in cultured somatic cells , numerous observations point to the region occupied by the chromosomes as the potential source of the cytokinetic signal ( see Margolis and Andreassen , 1993 ) . Consistent with this view , perfora - tion of NRK cells between the chromosomal region and cortex at metaphase inhibited division on the operated side and caused microtubules to assume an interphase - like network ( Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . However , similar perfora - tions made during anaphase were not inhibitory , indicat - ing that the influence of the chromosomes is restricted to late metaphase / early anaphase ( Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . In the present experiments , we found the pattern of cleavage to be predicted by the location of the metaphase plate in tripolar cells ( Fig . 1 , Ill , arrowheads ) . Particularly infor - mative was the pattern of cleavage in cells with V - shaped metaphase plates . Presumably , in cells with a small angle between the chromosome branches ( Fig ~ ' 4 ) , a signal from the chromosomal region impinges on the cortex at three points , generating three ingressions . When the angle is large ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) , signals from the two branches are expected to merge at the center , resulting in only two fur - rows . Together these observations indicate that while mi - crotubule bundles may interact more directly and con - tinuously with the cortex , signals for bundle formation originate transiently from the vicinity of the metaphase plate . This view appears to conflict with the recent finding that cleavage in grasshopper spermatocytes is uncompro - mised following removal of all the chromosomes during early mitosis ( Zhang and Nicklas , 1996 ) . However , the equatorial region of these manipulated cells contained prominent microtubule bundles as did control cells , and it is possible that the manipulation exposed microtubule plus ends , thereby permitting cytokinesis . Recently , a number of proteins have been found to re - locate from various parts of the spindle to the midzone during telophase , including inner centromere proteins ( INCENPs ; Cooke et al . , 1987 ) , TD60 ( Andreassen et al . , 1991 ) , and members of the kinesin family . The behavior of these proteins suggest that they may contribute to the sig - naling of cytokinesis ( for reviews see Earnshaw and Ber - nat , 1991 ; Rattner , 1992 ; Earnshaw and Mackay , 1994 ) . In the present study , we found TD60 distribution to correlate tightly with cleavage activity ( Fig . 7 ) ; however , the kine - sin - like CHO1 antigen was absent from some cleavage sites . This was surprising as it has been suggested that ki - nesins , including CHO1 ( Sellitto and Kuriyama , 1988 ; Nis - low et al . , 1992 ) and centromeric polypeptide - E ( Yen et al . , 1991 ) are capable of organizing microtubules and de - livering molecules to their plus ends . It is possible that Wheatley and Wang Midzone Microtubules in " Cytokinesis 987 Figure 7 . TD60 localization in tripolar NRK cells .

A sec - ond cell ( A ' - C ' ) , which had a shallow V - shaped metaphase plate , was watched as it pro - gressed from metaphase to telophase . It was then fixed and stained to reveal F - actin ( B ' ) and TD60 ( C ' ) distribu - tions . F - actin and TD60 lo - calizations were always tightly linked . Bar , 10 ~ m . CHOl - negative furrows were in an early stage of regres - sion ; alternatively there may be redundancy within the sys - tem such that when one motor is absent another substi - tutes . Moreover , both midzone microtubules and cytokinesis were found to be disrupted when a kinesin - related protein , KLP3A , was mutated in Drosophila ( Williams et al . , 1995 ) . With a clear view of the relationship between microtu - bules and cytokinesis , the key future task would be to identify and characterize signaling components that mi - grate from the spindle to the equatorial cortex . This study was prompted by discussion with members from the labs of Drs . David Burgess , Bill Earnshaw , Tony Hyman , Dan Kiehart , Issei Mabuchi , Fumio Matsumara , Tom Pollard , and John White during a Hu - man Frontier Meeting with Ray Rappaport as invited discussant . We thank all attendees for their stimulating thoughts and ideas . We are also grateful to Dr . Kip Sluder for his comments on the manuscript .
