A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t driven deformation of polymer substrates loaded with fluorescent beads 1 , 2 . Although widely used , TFM provides µm spatial resolution and nN force sensitivity , orders of magnitude greater than the pN forces applied by individual receptors . To address these limitations , we previously developed molecular tension probes to map the magnitude of receptor forces with pN sensitivity 3 . Molecular tension probes are comprised of an extendible “spring - like” element ( e . g . polyethylene - glycol , DNA , or protein ) , flanked by a fluorophore and quencher and immobilized on a surface . Receptor forces applied to the probe extend the “spring , ” separating the fluorophore - quencher pair , and generating up to a 100 - fold increase in fluorescence 4 , 5 . Complementary approaches employing genetically encoded FRET - based tension probes are powerful 6 , but also lack information on force orientation 2 . Indeed , no current method can map the orientation of traction forces with pN sensitivity . Herein , we integrate fluorescence polarization ( FP ) techniques with molecular tension probes to enable molecular force microscopy ( MFM ) , thereby generating the highest resolution maps of pN traction force orientations . To measure force orientation , we applied FP to DNA - based tension probes labeled with Cy3B ( Supplementary Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 1 – 2 ) because this class of probes displays the highest signal - to - background ratio of reported molecular force probes 5 , a tunable force response threshold 4 , and cyanine dyes stack against the nucleobases of the duplex , perpendicular to its long axis 7 . Stacking is vital , because FP requires a known and fixed dye orientation relative to the biomolecule to determine its orientation . When receptor - mediated forces exceed the F 1 / 2 , the equilibrium force at which 50 % of hairpins unfold , the dye separates from the quencher , producing a significant enhancement in fluorescence ( Fig . 1a ) . Importantly , rotatable bonds anchoring the probe enable the DNA and attached fluorophore to explore a hemisphere of orientations ( grey hemisphere , Fig 1b ) . Receptor forces dictate the orientation of the DNA probe , restricting both its mobility ( Supplementary Note 1 , Supplementary Fig . 2 ) and the allowable conformations of the cyanine dye ( yellow disc , Fig . 1b ) . Moreover , hairpins experiencing F < F 1 / 2 are folded and do not contribute to the fluorescence signal ; in contrast hairpins experiencing F≥F 1 / 2 generate the FP signal . Accordingly , MFM is extraordinarily sensitive due to this “mechano - selection” , where the random orientations of relaxed probes do not dampen the FP signal as is the case for conventional polarization measurements , and only mechanically strained and oriented probes generate a FP response . We first tested our ability to measure the orientation of traction forces generated by integrin α IIb β 3 in human platelets because their activation and clotting functions are mediated by mechanical forces 8 – 10 . Human platelets seeded on tension probes presenting the RGD peptide ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) produced robust signal , corresponding to integrins that apply F≥4 . 7 pN ( F 1 / 2 ) ( Fig . 1c ) 4 . When these platelets were imaged using emission - resolved FP 11 , we observed high anisotropy along the axis perpendicular to the excitation polarization and low anisotropy along the parallel axis ( Fig . 1c , Supplementary Fig . 3a , 4 ) . Probes linking the Cy3B to the DNA with a flexible linker or probes tagged using Alexa488 , which poorly stacks with the DNA , attenuated the anisotropy signal , further confirming the results ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Modeling showed that the anisotropy map was consistent with Brockman et al . Page 2 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 .

To determine the 3D orientation of unfolded DNA probes , we used excitation - resolved FP ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) , where fluorescence intensity is quantified as a function of excitation polarization ( Φ excitation ) 12 . This approach only requires adding a rotatable half - wave plate into the path of a polarized excitation source in a conventional fluorescence microscope . Excitation - resolved FP can resolve dye orientation because fluorescence intensity depends on the alignment between the fluorophore and Φ excitation ( Fig . 1d ) . Due to the free rotational motion of the DNA helix along its long axis , the stacked fluorophore adopts a plane of orientations ( yellow disc , Fig . 1b ) . By varying Φ excitation and measuring total fluorescence , we determined the projection of the dye’s orientation onto the imaging plane ( Fig . 1b , d ) , providing the in - plane force orientation ( Φ force ) and tilt angle ( θ force ) ( Supplementary Note 3 , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We created an interactive graphical interface ( Supplementary Software 1 ) to illustrate the relationship between probe orientation and fluorescence intensity as a function of Φ excitation . Fluorescence intensity varies sinusoidally with Φ excitation ( Fig . 1d ) : Φ force is calculated from the phase , while θ force is calculated indirectly from the amplitude ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Note 3 , Supplementary Fig . 5 , Supplementary Table 3 – 4 ) . We measured the probe density as 694±32 molecules / μm 2 , with an average of 3 . 4 probes / pixel . Therefore , θ force and Φ force represent the average receptor force orientation within each diffraction - limited area ( Supplementary Note 4 discusses ensemble averaging ) . In silico modeling showed that the accuracy of MFM depends on the signal brightness and on θ force . In Fig . 1 , we report force orientations with an error < 15° for θ force and < 10° for Φ force , except for vertical forces ( θ force < 10° ) , where MFM less accurately measures Φ force ( Supplementary Note 4 , Supplementary Fig . 6 , 7 ) . We confirmed the robustness of our approach by measuring the orientation of cyanine dye ( DiI ) - doped phospholipid membranes ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . During an MFM experiment , we acquired images of human platelets on tension probes while continuously rotating the excitation polarization . Representative images at Φ excitation = 0° and 90° are anti - correlated , confirming that Cy3B was oriented by platelet forces ( Fig . 1e ) . We fit the fluorescence intensity as a function of Φ excitation to sinusoids for each pixel to determine the 3D force orientation , producing an MFM map of platelet forces ( Fig . 1f - g , Supplementary Fig . 9 , Supplementary Software 2 ) . Dipole orientation represents the XY force axis ( Φ force ) , color represents θ force , and dipole length specifies the fraction of unfolded probes . Strikingly , this platelet exhibited force orientation toward an axis rather than isotropic contraction ( Fig . 1h ) . Multi - cell analysis revealed two platelet populations : one with forces oriented toward an axis , the other with forces radially oriented , consistent with previously reported isotropic contraction 9 ( Fig . 1i , Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Recent evidence links microtubule marginal band extension during platelet activation with microtubule coiling , and formation of a symmetry axis 13 , providing a potential explanation for the observed force axis . Platelet immunostaining revealed that tension and actin flank a coiled microtubule band ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Forces at the platelet edge were radially isotropic , but interior forces exhibited axial organization , indicating two distinct modes of contraction during platelet activation ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Many biological processes require coordination between cells 14 ; however , TFM resolution is reduced when imaging forces in multicellular structures 15 . MFM addresses this issue because each probe reports force orientation without mechanical interference from adjacent receptors or cells . To demonstrate this capability , we applied MFM to platelet aggregates , determining that the average force axes of the constituent platelets did not appear to be ordered across platelet aggregates ( 6 aggregates with > 5 cells from n = 3 independent experiments ) ( Fig . 2a - c , Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Force orientations were not aligned in 38 % ( 12 / 31 ) of platelet - platelet boundaries ( Fig . 2c , inset 2 ) , further indicating that platelet forces are not necessarily coordinated within a clot . These findings , combined with the observation that platelet contraction increases with microenvironment stiffness 8 , could contribute to understanding the characteristic anisotropy and spatial heterogeneity of clot structure and mechanics 16 . To further demonstrate the power of MFM , we mapped the orientation of integrin - mediated forces in NIH - 3T3 fibroblasts . Fibroblasts adhere through integrin - based focal adhesions ( FAs ) , which physically bridge the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix . Stably - transfected GFP - paxillin fibroblasts were plated on the tension probes and imaged , generating an MFM map ( Fig . 2d - g ) . The integrin forces were generally radially aligned ( Fig . 2g , Supplementary Fig . 9 , 13 ) . We identified 494 FAs by segmenting the tension images of 15 cells . Within individual FAs , Φ force values were coherent ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) and tilt angles displayed only 1 . 5° of variation between the distal and proximal sides of the adhesion ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) , indicating that integrin forces were aligned both in - plane and normal to the substrate . Next , we compared integrin MFM maps for platelets and fibroblasts and found the average θ force was similar at 40°±2° and 39°±4° , respectively . Fibroblast forces are more vertical at the cell center , with a median θ force of 30° , and become increasingly lateral near the cell periphery with median θ force of 41° . In comparison , platelets exhibit less variation in θ force from the cell center ( median 35° ) to its periphery ( median 40° ) ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . In summary , MFM revealed a previously unreported axis of force alignment in activated platelets 9 . Additionally , MFM directly measures platelet integrin forces . Unlike TFM techniques , MFM does not require advanced computational capabilities to resolve the full 3D vector of cellular forces 17 . Advanced TFM measurements of mature FAs suggested a sizable proportion of cell traction was normal to the substrate plane 17 in agreement with our measured θ force of ~ 40° in fibroblast FAs . Structural analyses of FAs using super - resolution imaging ( iPALM ) and scanning angle fluorescence interference contrast microscopy report tilt angles for the FA adaptor talin , of 50 – 60° 18 , 19 . MFM reports integrin forces within ~ 10° of the talin average tilt angle , providing a direct link between molecular forces and FA structure . Note that because MFM reports ensemble force orientations , the measured tilt angle provides a lower bound on θ force for individual receptor forces ( Supplementary Note 4 ) . Additionally , GFP - α v β 3 integrin emission - resolved FP measurements showed coalignment of integrins within FAs 20 , consistent with our measurements showing low variance of integrin forces within FAs . Springer and colleagues have argued that forces lateral to the cell membrane are responsible for activating integrins , in contrast to normal forces that drive the inactive state of the receptor 21 . MFM provides the capabilities to Brockman et al . Page 4 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 .

Methods Streptavidin Surface Preparation— DNA - based tension probes were prepared based on our published protocols 4 , 5 . Briefly , glass coverslips were successively sonicated ( ~ 5 min ) in nanopure ( 18 . 2 M Ω ) water followed by sonication in ethanol . Coverslips were dried at 90° C for 15 minutes and then cleaned in piranha solution , a 3 : 1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and 30 % hydrogen peroxide ( caution , piranha acid is extremely corrosive and may explode if exposed to organic materials ) , washed 6 times in nanopure water and then immersed in 4 successive beakers of ethanol .

Briefly , rectangular glass coverslips ( 25 × 75 mm ) were cleaned using piranha solution as described above . Slides were then washed in 6 successive beakers of nanopure water and then etched in a beaker of KOH ( 0 . 5 M ) for 1 hour in an ice - filled sonicator . The coverslips were washed in 6 successive beakers of nanopure water , followed by 3 successive beakers of ethanol . In a fourth beaker of ethanol , slides were reacted with 3 % APTES v / v for 1 h . Coverslips were washed 2x with acetone , 3 – 6 times with nanopure water , dried under a stream of N 2 gas , and firmly attached to Ibidi channels ( µ - Slide VI 0 . 4 ) . The silanized slides were reacted with 1 % w / v lipoic acid polyethylene glycol ( MW = 3400 ) and 10 % w / v 2000 molecular weight polyethylene glycol ( PEG 2000 ) in 0 . 1 M NaHCO3 ( pH 9 ) for 30 min . Slides were washed 3x with nanopure water and dried under a stream of ultra - high purity N 2 . Slides were reacted for 30 min with 1 % NHS - acetate in 0 . 1M NaHCO 3 ( pH 9 ) to consume any unreacted amines on the surface . 50 µL of 8 . 8nm gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs ) , concentration 20 nM , were added to each well and allowed to incubate for 30 min . Unbound AuNPs were removed by washing the channels 3 times with 1 mL of nanopure water . Finally , 45 µL of 300 nM DNA tension probes and 2 . 7 µM passivating ssDNA ( AuNP anchor strand , Supplementary Table 1 ) were added to each channel and each channel was sealed firmly with parafilm . Slides were incubated with the DNA overnight at 4°C in a petri dish . A water soaked kimwipe was also placed in the petri dish to maintain humidity during this reaction . Just prior to imaging , channels were washed with a cell imaging media and cells were added . Preparation of small unilamellar vesicle ( SUV ) . — Small unilamellar vesicles with an average diameter of 100 nm were prepared by lipid extrusion . In brief , 4 mg mL −1 of DOPC lipid was diluted in ~ 1mL chloroform in a round bottom flask and the chloroform was removed by rotary evaporation to form a thin lipid film . The lipid film was further dried under a steam of N 2 and then hydrated with 2 mL of milli - Q water . To dissolve the lipid film , three freeze - thaw cycles were performed . The lipid solution was then repeatedly extruded ( ~ 10 times ) through a 100 nm polycarbonate filter until the solution became clear . The extruded SUVs are stored at 4 o C and used within 4 – 6 weeks . Preparation of DiI - doped Phospholipid Membranes Supported on Microparticles— 100 µL 1 mg mL −1 5 µm silica beads were mixed with 100 µl of 2 mg mL −1 DOPC vesicles and equilibrated on a rocker for 15 min at room temperature . The supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) beads were purified by 3 successive 5 min spins at 2000 RPM . After each spin , the supernatant was removed and replaced with 1 mL of 1x PBS . The SLB beads were incubated with 5 µM DiI for 15 minutes . The DiI loaded SLB beads were separated from free DiI via 3 successive 5 min spins at 2000 RPM . Once again , the supernatant was removed in between each spin and replaced with 1 mL of 1x PBS . Finally , SLB beads were placed in clean wells of a coverslip - bottom 96 - well plate in 1x PBS . Matrix - Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization - Time of Flight ( MALDI - TOF ) — For peptide MALDI - TOF , saturated α - cyano - 4 - hydroxycinnaminic acid matrix was prepared in 50 % acetonitrile and 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid . 1 . 5 µL of the matrix was mixed on a MALDI plate with 1 µL of the sample suspended in nanopure water . For DNA MALDI - TOF , a Brockman et al . Page 6 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 .

Samples were dried for 20 – 30 minutes and then analyzed by MALDI - TOF ( Voyager STR ) . Hairpin Hybridization— DNA oligonucleotides were hybridized at 200 nM ( 300 nM for AuNP - based probes ) in a 0 . 2 mL Thermowell Tube . DNA was heated to 90°C and then cooled at a rate of 1 . 3°C per minute to 35°C . Platelet Handling— Experiments were performed with blood from human volunteers drawn according to IRB - approved protocols ( Georgia Institute of Technology : Central Institutional Review Board ; Emory University , Institutional Review Board ) in compliance with all ethical regulations . Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to experimentation . Venous blood was drawn from the arm of human volunteers in two 3 mL portions with the first portion discarded . Anticoagulant citrate dextrose ( ACD ) solution ( 0 . 75 mL ) was added to the whole blood . The whole blood / ACD mixture was spun at 150 RCF for 15 minutes at the lowest centrifuge acceleration and braking settings to avoid platelet activation . The platelet rich plasma was removed , combined with 10 % ACD v / v , and spun at 900 RCF for 5 minutes at the lowest centrifuge acceleration and braking settings . The platelet poor plasma was aspirated following the spin and the platelets were gently suspended in 2 mL 1x Tyrodes with 0 . 1 % BSA w / v . Platelets were allowed to return to a resting state for ~ 1 hour prior to the start of each experiment . Platelet Aggregate Formation— Immediately prior to imaging , platelets were suspended in 1x Tyrodes ( pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA w / v , Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 unit / µL thrombin , and 10 µg / µL fibrinogen . This mixture was inverted 3 times and immediately pipetted into one well of a microchannel formed from an Ibidi µ - slide VI 0 . 4 and a 25 mm × 75 mm glass coverslip . Platelet aggregates were observed on the surface within 5 – 10 min . Immunostaining— Platelets were allowed to spread on RGD - DNA surfaces for 20 min then fixed for 10 minutes with cold 4 % formaldehyde v / v in 1x PBS . Platelets were permeabilized for 10 min with 0 . 25x Triton and blocked with 1 % BSA for 40 min . Platelets were stained for actin with Alexa - 647 labeled phalloidin ( ThermoFisher , A22287 ) and tubulin with mouse anti bovine α tubulin ( ThermoFisher , A21371 ) followed by an Alexa - 488 labeled goat anti - mouse secondary ( ThermoFisher , A - 21121 ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Emission - Resolved Fluorescence Polarization Imaging— Imaging was accomplished on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope , operated by Nikon Elements software , a 1 . 49 NA CFI Apo 100x objective , perfect focus system , and a TIRF laser launch with 80 mW 561 nm and 488 nm lasers . A Chroma quad cube ( ET - 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 nm Laser Quad Band ) and reflection interference contrast microscopy ( RICM ) ( Nikon : 97270 ) cube were used for imaging . Widefield epifluorescence illumination was provided by an X - Cite 120 Brockman et al . Page 7 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 .

An Andor TuCam system with a wire grid polarizer ( Moxtek , Andor : TR - EMFS - F03 ) split the fluorescence by polarization to two Andor iXon Ultra 897 electron multiplying charge coupled devices . To flip the laser excitation polarization , a half wave plate ( Thorlabs ) mounted on a slider at 45° was inserted into the light path . The lasers were operated in widefield mode , focused at the back focal plane and travelling along the optical axis . This optical configuration was used in conducting the experiments depicted in Figure 1c , Supplementary Figure 4 , and Supplementary Figure 8b . Live human platelets imaging was completed within 8h of platelet harvesting . Camera background signal was measured from images of 1x PBS . An illumination correction image was produced during each imaging session by averaging 10 images of cy3B in solution . The fluorescence emission was split into components parallel and perpendicular to the laser by a polarizing beam splitter . The polarization bias of the microscope , or G - factor , was computed by taking the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence of fluorescein in solution . Large - numerical aperture corrections 22 were used to correct for the polarization mixing of the microscope . Excitation Resolved Fluorescence Polarization Imaging— Fluorescence azimuth experiments were conducted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope , operated by Nikon Elements software , with a Chroma quad cube and an RICM cube . A 150 mW OBIS 561 nm laser was used to illuminate the sample , operating at 3 % power . The polarization of the laser was rotated via a 400 – 800 nm SM1 - threaded mounted 1 - inch achromatic half wave plate ( Thorlabs ) rotated via a motorized precision rotation stage ( Thorlabs , PRM1Z8 ) and a k - cube brushed DC servo motor controller ( Thorlabs , KDC101 ) to control the excitation polarization . The rotator was operated by the Kinesis software . Images were taken on a Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash4 . 0 v2 Digital CMOS ( Product code : C11440 – 22CU ) . Images were collected with a 100× 1 . 49 NA CFI Apochromat TIRF series oil - immersion objective ( Nikon Instruments ) . The exposure time for all imaging experiments was 50 ms . Fluorescence was binned 2×2 on the CMOS for fibroblast and platelet aggregate experiments to increase the signal - noise ratio . Nikon Elements “Fast Acquisition” was used to maximize the acquisition speed and eliminate any delay between frames . The lasers were operated in widefield mode , focused on the back focal plane and travelling along the optical axis . This optical configuration was used in the acquisition of all data except the data presented in Figure 1c , Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 8b . Prior to image acquisition , the half wave plate was set in motion . After the rotator reached its maximum velocity of 25° / s ( corresponding to 50° / s of excitation polarization rotation ) , 73 fluorescence images were acquired continuously with a 50 ms exposure time . The entire image sequence required 3 . 6 seconds to complete . Each image corresponded to a change in excitation polarization of 2 . 5° of arc , centered around the target excitation angle ( e . g . the polarizer rotated through an arc from −1 . 25°−1 . 25° during the 50 ms acquisition for the “0°” image . Immediately prior to imaging , platelets were suspended in pH 7 . 4 1x Tyrode’s Buffer supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA w / v , Hank’s Balanced Salt solution , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM CaCl 2 and then added to the cRGD - DNA probe modified surface . Platelets began spreading on the cRGD streptavidin surface within 5 min of seeding . Brockman et al . Page 8 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 .

Platelet aggregates were imaged on AuNP surfaces because these surfaces produced more robust signals for the aggregates . Fibroblasts were imaged on cRGD streptavidin surfaces at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( v / v ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum without phenol red . Image Processing— We performed all image processing in MATLAB 2016a ( MathWorks ) . The code is available as Supplementary Software 2 . The bioformats toolbox enabled direct transfer of Nikon Elements image files ( . nd2 ) into the MATLAB environment . To save computational time , we analyzed user - identified ROIs containing cells . Edge finding was accomplished through Chan - Vese edge finding ( available on MathWorks File Exchange ) 23 . Correcting for Microscope Polarization Bias and Laser Illumination Profile— Images of an autofluorescent plastic slide ( Chroma : 92001 ) under conditions identical to cell imaging conditions enabled correction for the microscope’s polarization bias and the uneven illumination of the laser . The autofluorescence of the Chroma slide is not ordered , thus any changes in intensity as a function of polarization must be due to the bias introduced by the microscope . We normalized the set of 73 images to the maximum intensity according to the following equation : Bias i = Bias Image i − background detector max Bias , i = 1 , 2 , …73 ( 1 ) Where max ( Bias ) is the detector background subtracted maximum intensity within the image sequence . We normalized cell images to this set of normalized illumination correction images as follows : Cell Image i = Raw Image i − background detector Bias i ( 2 ) Correcting for both for the uneven illumination profile of the laser and for the polarization bias of the microscope . Background Subtraction and Signal to Noise Ratio ( SNR ) — We next determined the local background ( background surface ) and subtracted this value from the cellular tension signal . Background surface corresponds to the fluorescence of the quenched , randomly oriented fluorophores attached to DNA probes not experiencing cellular force . Brockman et al . Page 9 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Cell Image i , background subtracted = Cell Image i − background surface ( 3 ) User - defined ROIs were used to determine the local background intensity . When single cells could be isolated with rectangular ROIs , we defined a background ROI as a “frame” consisting of all pixels within 3 pixels of the edge of the ROI . When the border of the ROI contained fluorescence intensity from a second cell , a user - identified square served in place of the “frame” . We then defined Background surface as the mean intensity and the noise as the standard deviation of the intensity within the background ROI . Only pixels with a SNR of > 5 were accepted for analysis . Photobleaching Correction— To correct for the loss of fluorescence intensity due to photobleaching , we employed previously described method 12 . . Briefly , we defined an average whole cell bleaching exponent by taking the mean value of the bleach exponents for each pixel of the cell . The bleach exponents for each pixel were calculated as : Bleach Exp = ln I 0∘ I 180∘ / 72 ( 4 ) Where I 0° is the image corresponding to Φ excitation = 0° and I 180° is the image and corresponding to Φ excitation = 180° , or Cell Image 1 , background subtracted for I 0° and Cell Image 73 , background subtracted for I 180° in equation 3 . Pixels where fluorescence increased from I 0° to I 180° were excluded as this increase must be due to biological changes or to random noise , not photobleaching . To correct for bleaching , we applied the following formula : Cell Image i , background subtracted Bleach Corrected = Cell Image i * exp mean ( Bleach Exp ) * ( i − 1 ) , i = 1 , 2 , …73 ( 5 ) Curve fitting— We thresholded the bleach corrected images by the signal - noise ratio . Because intensity changes as a function of polarization reflect fluorophore orientation , pixel fluorescence intensity will vary from very high to very low as a function of Φ excitation . We therefore applied the SNR threshold pixel - by - pixel to the maximum fluorescence intensity in each pixel fluorescence polarization series ( max ( Cell Image iBleach Corrected ) ) . We performed nonlinear curve fitting in MATLAB pixel - by - pixel by fitting fluorescence intensity as a function of Φ excitation to the function : Intensity = amplitude * cos 2 ( ϕ excitation − azimuth ) + average ( 6 ) Brockman et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t The fitted azimuth gives the average fluorophore orientation , described as the azimuth within a pixel , while the amplitude and average provide the tilt angle of the cellular force ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . To speed computation , we employed a dynamic initial guess for each pixel : the initial amplitude was set as 1 . 35 * ( Imax - average ) , the average was initially set as the average intensity within each pixel , and the phase was initially specified as the azimuth , defined by : azimuth guess = 12arctan I 45∘ − I 135∘ I 0∘ − I 90∘ ( 7 ) Hairpin Percent Open Calculation— Because DNA hairpins exhibit near - binary transitions between a fluorescent open state ( F receptor > F 1 / 2 ) and a quenched closed state ( F receptor < F 1 / 2 ) , the fluorescence intensity of a surface is linearly dependent on the percent of probes that are open within a pixel . We prepared both quenched Black Hole Quencher 1 ( BHQ - 1 ) labeled immobilization strand ) and unquenched ( unlabeled immobilization strand ) streptavidin and AuNP surfaces as described above . The quenched surface intensity provides a greyscale value for 0 % open DNA hairpins while the unquenched surface provides a greyscale value for 100 % open DNA hairpins . We calculated the dequenching ratio as : dequenching ratio = I 100 % open − background detector I 0 % open − bckground detector ( 8 ) The theoretical maximum of experimental surfaces was then calculated as : I maximum = dequenching ratio * I background ( 9 ) The percentage of open hairpins within each pixel was then calculated as : % Open = I pixel − I background I maximum − I background ( 10 ) Measuring the Density of DNA Tension Probes on the Surface— A fluorescent lipid bilayer calibration curve was constructed based on a previously reported protocol 24 . Small unilamellar vesicles ( DOPC and increasing amounts ( 0 – 0 . 075 mol % ) of Lissamine Rhodamine B - DHPE ) were prepared and deposited on base etched , glass bottom 96 well plates for 15 min to form SLBs . Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Nikon Ti - E microscope . The density of fluorophores per unit area was determined from the footprint of DOPC ( 0 . 72 nm 2 ) within supported lipid membranes 25 . Therefore , the number of DOPC molecules per µm2 of supported lipid bilayer is ~ 2 . 787 × 10 6 / µm2 . We constructed a supported lipid bilayer calibration curve to relate the known Lissamine Rhodamine B - DHPE density to fluorescence intensity . To use this calibration curve to calculate Cy3B - DNA Brockman et al . Page 11 Nat Methods . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 February 01 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t density , a scaling factor ( F factor ) is introduced to account for the difference in brightness between Cy3B and Rhodamine B . We prepared varying concentrations ( 50 , 100 , and 200 nM ) of Cy3B - DNA and Lissamine Rhodamine B - DHPE molecules and compared their intensities at the same concentration to obtain the F factor , defined as : F = I solution Cy 3 B DNA I solution Rhodamine B − DHPE ( 11 ) where I solution ( Cy3B - DNA ) and I solution ( Rhodamine B - DHPE ) are the intensity of the Cy3B - DNA or the Rhodamine B - DHPE in solution at identical concentrations , measured on a fluorescence microscope by focusing into the solution ( ~ 10 µm above the coverslip ) . We obtained an average F factor of ~ 12 . 47 . We measured the average intensity ( from 30 ROIs ) of an “unquenched” Cy3B - DNA tension probe surface as 10356±329 A . U . ( mean ± s . e . m . ) . We then converted this intensity into the equivalent Lissamine Rhodamine B - DHPE intensity . Finally , we used our Lissamine Rhodamine B - DHPE calibration curve to estimate the Cy3B - DNA tension probe density as 694 . 6±32 . 7 probes per µm2 ( mean ± s . e . m . ) as specified in a previous report 24 . Generating an MFM Map— Force orientation was calculated for every pixel in the cell images that exceeded a minimum signal - noise value . The tilt angle was calculated for each pixel as described in Supplementary Note 3 . The percent of open MFM hairpins within each pixel was calculated from equation 10 based on the fitted maximum intensity ( average + amplitude , calculated from the curve fitting detailed in equation 6 ) . Dipoles were plotted via Matlab’s “quiver” function . Vector length was scaled by the percent of open hairpins . Dipole color was specified by tilt angle . Accounting for Hardware / Software Delays— Delays in Nikon Elements and / or in the Kinesis software caused image acquisition to begin at an excitation polarization slightly offset from 0° . To account for these delays , we measured the azimuth of DiI - doped SLB’s on a 5 µm bead . We observed a constant offset of approximately 14° between tangents to the bead surface and the measured DiI orientation . We validated the measured offset by applying it to bead datasets not used in the calculation of the offset parameter , producing the measured dipoles tangential to the bead surface in Supplementary Fig 8 . This 14° offset was applied to all subsequent MFM acquisitions . Synthesis DNA MFM probes were synthesized as previously described 4 . The sequences of all strands are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . Briefly , 100 nmoles of c ( RGDfK ( PEG - PEG ) ) was reacted with approximately 150 nmoles of NHS - azide in DMF overnight . Product 1 was purified via reverse phase HPLC with a Grace Alltech C18 column ( 1 mL / min flow rate ; Solvent A : 0 . 1M TEAA + 0 . 05 % TFA , Solvent B : acetonitrile + 0 . 05 % TFA ; starting condition : 90 % A + 10 % B , 1 % / min gradient B ) and its identity was verified with MALDI - TOF ( Supplementary Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 2 ) .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Product 1 was ligated to the tension probe ligand strand via 1 , 3 - dipolar cycloaddition reaction . Briefly , 5 nmoles of alkyne ligand strand was reacted overnight with ~ 75 nanomoles of product 1 in the presence of 0 . 5M ascorbic acid , 0 . 5M Cu - TBTA , and 50 % DMSO . The product was purified with a P2 size exclusion column , and then using reverse phase HPLC with an Agilent Advanced oligo column ( 0 . 5 mL / min flow rate ; Solvent A : 0 . 1M TEAA , Solvent B : acetonitrile ; starting condition : 90 % A + 10 % B , 1 % / min gradient B ) and the product’s identity was verified via MALDI - TOF ( Supplementary Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 2 ) . Following the above procedure , products 2 , 3 , and 6 were produced by varying the identity of the alkyne - conjugated ligand strand . Products 2 and 3 were dried and reacted overnight with a 15x excess of Cy3B - NHS dissolved in 1 µL DMSO . The total reaction volume was 10 µL , composed of 1x PBS supplemented with 0 . 1M NaHCO 3 . The reaction pot was purified by a P2 size exclusion gel to remove unreacted dye followed by HPLC purification ( 0 . 5 mL / min flow rate ; Solvent A : 0 . 1M TEAA , Solvent B : acetonitrile ; starting condition : 90 % A + 10 % B , 1 % / min gradient B ) to purify products 4 and 5 . The identities of products 4 and 5 were confirmed via MALDI - TOF ( Supplementary Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 2 ) . Please note that the DNA probes immobilized using AuNP have been previously characterized 5 and are not described here . Calculation of Cy3B Transition Dipole Moment All calculations were performed using version 4 . 0 . 0 of the ORCA 26 software package . Geometry optimization of the molecule was performed using the B3LYP 27 – 30 functional and the 6 – 31G * 31 basis set , while the TDDFT ( Time - dependent density functional theory ) excited state calculations and geometry optimizations used the 𝜔 B97X functional 32 and the correlation consistent polarized valence double zeta ( cc - pVDZ ) 33 basis set ( Supplementary Fig 4a ) . The 𝜔 B97x functional is a range - separated functional designed to handle long - range / charge transfer character of excited state . The optimized geometries for the ground state ( S 0 ) and the excited state ( S 1 ) are shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 , respectively . The TDM of the excited state corresponding to the first absorption peak calculated at the ground state geometry is ( x : 12 . 25 , y : 2 . 56 , z : 0 . 08 ) D , while the TDM corresponding to the first emission peak calculated at the excited state geometry is ( x : 11 . 71 , y : 2 . 38 , z : 0 . 15 ) D ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Solvation effects were taken into account in the ground state geometry optimization using the continuum solvent model COSMO 34 ( conductor - like - screening model ) , while the TDDFT calculations accounted for solvation effects using the PCM 35 ( Polarizable Continuum Model ) available in ORCA . Statistics— Two tailed two - sample t - tests were run on the sample means of the independent experiments for anisotropy differences between different tension probes ( Supplementary Figure 4a ) . The differences in the fitted amplitudes of individual platelets on the different tension probes were quantified by a two tailed two - sample allowing unequal variance . A paired t - test was used to compare the distributions of the central versus ring force distributions in platelets ( Supplementary Figure 12g ) . A two - sample t test allowing unequal variance was also used to compare the whole - cell average platelet and fibroblast tilt Brockman et al . Page 13 Nat Methods .

A one - way ANOVA was used to quantify the statistical significance of the radial dependence of the platelet and fibroblast tilt angles ( Supplementary Figure 14b ) . The Rayleigh test for uniformity was used on the angle - doubled average force axes of platelets within platelet aggregates to determine whether the average force axes were non - uniformly distributed ( Figure 2c ) .
