Kamm Published online : 1 August 2007 (cid:1) Humana Press Inc . 2007 Abstract Improving our ability to control capillary mor - phogenesis has implications for not only better understanding of basic biology , but also for applications in tissue engi - neering and in vitro testing . Numerous biomaterials have been investigated as cellular supports for these applications and the biophysical environment biomaterials provide to cells has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in directing cell function . Here , the ability of ionic self - assembling peptide gels to support capillary morphogenesis and the effect of their mechanical properties is investigated . When placed in a physiological salt solution , these oligo - peptides spontaneously self - assemble into gels with an extracellular matrix ( ECM ) - like microarchitecture . To eval - uate the ability of three - dimensional ( 3D ) self - assembled peptide gels to support capillary - like network formation , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were embedded within RAD16 - I ( ( RADA ) 4 ) or RAD16 - II ( ( RARADADA ) 2 ) peptide gels with various stiffness values . As peptide stiffness is decreased cells show increased elon - gation and are increasingly able to contract gels . The observation that capillary morphogenesis is favored in more malleable substrates is consistent with previous reports using natural biomaterials . The structural properties of peptide gels and their ability to support capillary morphogenesis in vitro make them promising biomaterials to investigate for numerous biomedical applications .

This understanding is critical for applications such as tissue engineering , where one of the major limi - tations to growing engineered tissues is a lack of blood vessels to provide oxygen and nutrients [ 2 ] . Engineered tissues are also ﬁnding applications in vitro , where tissue - like cultures are being developed for pharmacological testing [ 3 – 5 ] or the study of cell biology in more tissue - like environments . In these types of systems , inclusion of endothelial cells can promote survival and differentiated function of difﬁcult to culture cells [ 6 – 8 ] . Primarily towards these later applications , there has been great interest in understanding how to control the formation of A . L . Sieminski ( & ) (cid:1) R . D .

Three - dimensional in vitro angiogenesis models have been extremely useful in studying the effects of various factors , including angiogenic growth factors [ 9 – 11 ] , angiogenesis inhibitors [ 12 ] , integrins [ 13 ] , cell – cell junc - tions [ 14 ] , matrix metalloproteinases [ 15 ] , and supporting cells [ 16 ] , on the formation of capillary - like networks . These studies have primarily used naturally derived bio - material supports , such as collagen , Matrigel , or ﬁbrin . As with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) in vivo , cells adhering to these supports receive insoluble biochemical signals and are able to probe the biophysical properties of their sur - roundings . While soluble and insoluble signaling stimuli , such as growth factors and integrin ligands ( e . g . , RGD ) , have been relatively well studied both in vivo and in vitro , the importance of biophysical cues has also become clear in endothelial capillary morphogenesis [ 17 , 18 ] , as well as other cellular differentiation processes [ 19 , 20 ] . In partic - ular , providing endothelial cells with a relatively soft 3D ECM environment typically facilitates capillary - like net - work formation [ 17 , 21 , 22 ] . Although ECM supports have been extremely useful in the study of capillary - like network formation , as well as the differentiated behavior of other cell types , there is also interest in the use of synthetic biomaterial supports for growing capillary - like networks . This is particularly true for in vivo applications because of the increased control of composition and processing , non - animal source , and greatly diminished risk of disease transmission . Ionic self - assem - bling peptide gels are an attractive family of synthetic bi - omaterials that may provide the combined advantages of ECM - like microarchitecture [ 23 ] with the advantages of synthetic materials . This family of 8 – 32 amino acid oligo - peptides , with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains , is characterized by self - assembly into ﬁlaments upon exposure to salt [ 24 , 25 ] . These materials have been shown to support the adhesion and function of a number of different cell types , including endothelial cells [ 26 , 27 ] , cardiomyocytes [ 28 ] , and neuronal progenitor cells [ 29 ] . We focus here on two self - assembling peptide family members , RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II , with amino acid sequences ( RADA ) 4 and ( RARADADA ) 2 , respectively . While a variety of types of synthetic biomaterials have been shown to support the in - growth of host vasculature in vivo [ 30 , 31 ] , few have been shown to support the for - mation of 3D capillary - like networks in vitro , with respect to demonstrating formation of 3D , multi - cellular , capillary - like networks of endothelial cells . RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II are particularly promising as biomaterial supports for 3D capillary - like network formation as RAD16 - I has previously been shown to promote endothelial cell mono - layer function [ 27 ] and RAD16 - II has been shown to pro - mote 2D cord - like networks formation of endothelial cells on the surface of the gel ( solid – liquid interface ) and hollow 3D structures by endothelial cells within the gel [ 26 ] . Additionally , injected RAD16 - II promotes the invasion of endothelial cells and formation of patent blood vessels in vivo [ 28 ] . In the area of biomaterials research and development , a great deal of attention has been paid to the role of cell adhesion to materials , while much less has been given to the biophysical aspects of biomaterial supports , such as ﬁber architecture and material stiffness , in directing the desired cellular functions . Consideration of these bio - physical parameters in choosing biomaterial supports will aid in promoting differentiated cell behaviors , such as capillary - like network formation . In the present study , we investigate the use of synthetic , ECM - like biomaterial supports , RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II , to generate 3D capil - lary - like networks , with a particular focus on the effects of gel stiffness on the extent of capillary - like network for - mation . We demonstrate that human endothelial cells undergo capillary morphogenesis within both RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II ionic self - assembling peptide gels , as evidenced by the formation of interconnected , multi - cellular capil - lary - like networks containing lumen - like structures . While these two peptides have similar sequences and could both reasonably be expected to promote capillary - like network formation , we could not predict a priori that cells would behave almost identically in them at matched stiffness values , as we present here . Materials and Methods Self - assembling Peptides Powdered RAD16 - II ( AcN - ( RARADADA ) 2 - CNH 2 , Syn - Pep , Dublin , CA ) was dissolved in water at 10 mg / ml and sonicated . RAD16 - I ( AcN - ( RADA ) 4 - CNH 2 , sold as BD PuraMatrix , Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) was a generous gift of 3DMatrix , Inc . and was supplied in solu - tion ( 10 mg / ml ) . Peptides were further diluted in sterile water as needed . Culture within and on Self - assembling Peptide Gels Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs , ﬁnal density of 5 · 10 6 cells / ml , Cascade Biologics , Portland , OR ) , suspended in 20 % sucrose , were mixed 1 : 1 with self - assembling peptide solutions ( ﬁnal concentrations as indi - cated ) . This mixture was induced to gel by pipetting 150 l l into inserts ( PICM - 012 - 50 , Millipore , Billerica , MA ) with 74 Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 a 9 . 77 ± 0 . 01 mm inner diameter ( n = 5 inserts measured three times each with digital calipers ) and exposing it to culture medium ( EBM - 2 , Cambrex , Walkersville , MD ) with an added 10 % FBS . Gelation medium was replaced after 1 h with standard culture medium supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF , R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) and phorbol - myristate acetate ( PMA , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , both at 50 ng / ml . In some experi - ments , the myosin inhibitor , 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) , was added to culture media at 10 mM . For experiments using collagen gels , cells ( 5 · 10 6 ) were sus - pended in 3 mg / ml type - I collagen prepared as previously described [ 17 ] . Gels were ﬁxed ( 4 % paraformaldehyde ) , stained ( 160 nM TRITC - phalloidin , Sigma , and DAPI ) , gently pressed between a slide and coverslip for visualization on a microscope ( Eclipse TE - 300 , Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Three - dimensional networks could be observed by adjusting the microscope focus in the z - axis or by collecting z - stacks with a confocal microscope . Lumen - like structures were visualized by confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP5 AOBS confocal system , Bensheim , Germany ) . Images were pro - cessed using Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) . Data shown are representative of more than three separate experiments ( n = 3 each ) . Rheometry Cell - free self - assembling peptides were gelled in a mold ( 8 . 5 mm ID , 900 l m high ) on PBS - soaked parchment paper ( Pall , East Hills , NY ) for 24 h . Molds were removed and gels were transferred to an AR1000 rheometer ( TA Instru - ments , Inc . , New Castle , DE ) with an 8 mm plate to obtain storage ( G 0 ) and loss ( G 00 ) moduli at constant oscillatory torque ( 0 . 1 l N m ) from 0 . 1 rad / s to 1 rad / s ; this frequency range was chosen because G 0 and G 00 were roughly fre - quency - independent . RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II were mea - sured at 1 , 1 . 5 , 2 , 2 . 5 , 3 , 5 , and 10 mg / ml ( n = 4 – 9 and 8 – 23 gels per concentration , respectively ) . Type - I collagen was measured at 3 mg / ml ( n = 5 ) . Gelation of RAD16 - II with serum and / or at 37 (cid:2) C had no effect on stiffness ( data not shown ) . Data were ﬁt using a power - law function . Transmission Electron Microscopy Samples for transmission electron microscopy were pre - pared by the quick freeze / deep etch method [ 32 ] . Brieﬂy , cell - free self - assembling peptide gels were slam frozen ( (cid:2) 195 (cid:2) C , EM - CPC , Leica Microsystems , Nussloch , Ger - many ) , transferred into a CFE - 60 freeze - fracture apparatus ( Cressington Scientiﬁc Instruments , Watford , UK ) at (cid:2) 180 (cid:2) C and < 2 · 10 6 mbar , fractured , etched for 30 min ( (cid:2) 100 (cid:2) C ) , and rotary shadowed with platinum ( 20 (cid:2) , 1 . 8 – 2 nm ) followed by carbon ( 90 (cid:2) ) . After digesting off sam - ples in bleach , replicas were ﬂoated on copper grids ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Ft . Washington , PA ) . They were examined and photomicrographs were taken using a Philips - 300 TEM ( Philips , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) . Quantiﬁcation and Data Analysis Extent of HUVEC elongation in 3D gels was obtained by measuring the lengths of the projected structures in each 2D image of rhodamine – phalloidin stained cells ( n = 3 – 7 for each condition ) ; for single cells the length is the cell diameter , while for network structures it is the total length of all interconnected traces . The structure length / cell ( * 25 l m ) was obtained by counting DAPI - stained nuclei within elongated , multi - cellular structures in representative DAPI and phalloidin - stained gels from each gel stiffness investigated . This number was used to estimate the number of cells in a given image from the structure lengths in that image and the number of cells was used in the calculation of fraction of single cells present . All structures (cid:3) 25 l m were taken to be single cells . Gel compaction was assessed by imaging and quantifying the projected areas of gels after culture ; initial gel top area of cell - containing gels was 67 . 8 mm 2 . Fiber geometries were measured by measuring ﬁber thicknesses and lengths using TEM images ( 2 – 5 images per concentration ) . Quantiﬁcation was performed using Scion Image ( Scion Corp . , Frederick , MD ) . Statisti - cal signiﬁcance was assessed by performing ANOVA fol - lowed by the Tukey – Kramer honest statistical difference test for multiple comparisons using an alpha value of 0 . 05 in JMP Software ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Results Self - assembling Peptide Gels Support Endothelial Cell Elongation Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were initially cultured at 5 · 10 6 cells / ml within 3 mg / ml RAD16 - I or RAD16 - II self - assembling peptide gels . HUVECs within 3 mg / ml collagen gels were also included in these studies for comparison . Under these conditions , HUVECs cultured for 2 days within RAD16 - I ( Fig . 1A ) and RAD16 - II ( Fig . 1B ) gels remained round or elongated as individual cells . HUVECs suspended within collagen gels , cultured under the same conditions , elongated more extensively , and formed multi - cellular capillary - like net - works under these conditions ( Fig . 1C ) . Structure sizes Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 75 within ﬂuorescent photomicrographs were quantiﬁed to support qualitative observations . Under these conditions the average structure lengths of HUVECs within RAD16 - I , RAD16 - II , and collagen gels were 115 ± 59 , 57 ± 18 , and 2 , 161 ± 1 , 384 l m , respectively . Numerous single cells were observed in peptide gels under these conditions and were also quantiﬁed ( see ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ for description of calculations ) . In RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II gels 34 ± 12 % and 20 ± 10 % of cells , respectively , were single cells ; no single cells were observed in collagen gels . Use of a lower cell density ( 1 · 10 6 cells / ml ) led to for - mation of even shorter structures within self - assembling peptide gels ( data not shown ) . While HUVEC are able to elongate within RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II self - assembling peptide gels under these conditions , they do not form interconnected capillary - like networks as they do in collagen . Changing Self - assembling Peptide Gel Stiffness by Changing Concentration We asked whether decreasing the stiffness of RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II could lead to more extensive elongation and capillary - like network formation by HUVEC . Self - assem - bling peptide gel bulk stiffness was varied by changing the peptide concentration and measured by rheometry . Mea - surements of cell - free gels were taken after 24 h to ensure uniform , stable stiffness values ; at early time points the stiffness of gels increased rapidly , while after 10 – 16 h it had stabilized ( Fig . 2A ) . No compaction of cell - free gels was observed . Gel stiffness values ( storage and loss mod - uli ) decreased with decreasing peptide concentration ( Fig . 2B , C ) . The concentration versus stiffness behavior of each self - assembling peptide was well - ﬁt by power laws ( Table 1 ) , similar to previous results with another self - assembling peptide gel , KFE - 8 [ 33 ] . For cell studies , peptide concentrations were calculated using these ﬁts so that equivalent stiffness values were used for each self - assembling peptide ( Fig . 2 and Table 1 ) . Since , more compliant gels have typically been seen to promote capil - lary morphogenesis , we explored concentrations lower than the 3 mg / ml used initially . Fiber architecture of self - assembling peptide gels at different concentrations was investigated in samples pre - pared by quick freeze / deep etch and viewing them with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Networks of ﬁbers in both RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II had a similar appearance at all concentrations investigated ( 1 – 10 mg / ml , 1 mg / ml and 3 mg / ml shown Fig . 3A – D ) . Although region - to - region variation made conclusive quantitative measurements somewhat difﬁcult , we observed that ﬁber length decreased with increasing concentration while ﬁber thickness remained similar or increased slightly ( Fig . 3 ) . For these self - assembling peptides , ﬁber thicknesses were on the order of 30 – 40 nm and ﬁber lengths were on the order of 200 – 300 nm over the range of concentrations investigated . Fiber length increased slightly with peptide concentration ( Fig . 3E ) while ﬁber thickness was less sensitive to concentration ( Fig . 3F ) . Overall , the ratio of thickness to length increased with concentration ( Fig . 3G ) . Given the current concentration versus geometry data , we would expect the ﬁber lengths to decrease by * 2 – 3 % and the ﬁber thicknesses to increase by * 1 – 7 % over the con - centration range of interest ( 1 – 3 mg / ml ) . Effect of Stiffness on Capillary Morphogenesis In a separate set of experiments , HUVECs within relatively stiff 735 Pa gels , corresponding to 3 . 82 mg / ml RAD16 - I ( results not shown ) or 3 mg / ml RAD16 - II ( results similar to Fig . 1B ) , elongated slightly as individual cells and formed few multi - cellular structures . Cells formed struc - tures with average sizes of 45 ± 12 and 62 ± 15 l m , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) . As gel stiffness was decreased to 400 Pa ( Fig . 4A , D ) and further to 127 Pa ( Fig . 4B , E ) , the extent of elongation and structure formation continued to increase . In 400 Pa RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II , HUVECs formed structures with average lengths of 77 ± 5 and Fig . 1 Morphology of HUVECs within self - assembling peptide or collagen gels . Representative photomicrographs of HUVECs at 5 · 10 6 cells / ml cultured within 3 mg / ml RAD16 - I ( A ) , RAD16 - II ( B ) , or collagen ( C ) gels . Cells were stained with rhodamine – phalloidin and imaged with a ﬂuorescence microscope . Scale bar is 50 l m for all images 76 Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 97 ± 28 l m , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) . At 127 Pa they formed 269 ± 19 and 229 ± 96 l m long structures , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) . The most pronounced effect was seen for HUVECs in extremely soft , * 46 Pa , RAD16 - I or RAD16 - II gels ( Fig . 4C , F ) in which HUVECs formed extensively interconnected , multi - cellular , capillary - like networks . These structures were clearly 3D as they could be seen to be continuous throughout different focal planes in confocal microscope z - stacks ( not shown ) . HUVECs in 46 Pa RAD16 - I and - II gels formed structures with average sizes of 405 ± 102 and 474 ± 125 l m , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) ; these values are signiﬁcantly different from all other conditions for both self - assembling peptides . There is also a trend towards a decrease in single cells as stiffness is decreased ( Fig . 5B ) . Further decreasing gel stiffness led to extreme gel compaction and a high cell density that did not allow for elongation ( results not shown ) , as previously shown with collagen gels [ 17 ] . In addition , when viewed in cross section by confocal microscopy , these structures appear to have hollow regions ( Fig . 6 ) suggesting the for - mation of lumens or vacuoles , which are precursors to lumens [ 34 ] . Compaction of Self - assembling Peptide and Collagen Gels We observed that , in addition to increasing capillary - like network formation , decreasing gel stiffness was also associated with an increase in self - assembling peptide gel compaction ( Fig . 7 ) . Although cell - free gels did not com - pact , cell - containing gels appeared to be compacted within hours as detected by microscopic observation of a pulling of the gel away from the mold ( data not shown ) . Cellular compaction of gels occurred over the 48 h of the experi - ment ( data not shown ) . HUVECs compacted relatively stiff 735 Pa RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II gels to 78 ± 17 % and 68 ± 14 % of their original areas , respectively ( Fig . 7 ) . In extremely compliant ( * 46 Pa ) RAD16 - I or RAD16 - II gels , HUVECs formed the most extensive networks and compacted gels to 38 ± 8 or 29 ± 5 % of their original areas , respectively ( Fig . 7 ) . To investigate the role of actin - myosin contractility , the myosin inhibitor , 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) , was added to media in cultures of HUVEC within 46 Pa gels . Cells remained completely round and compaction was inhibited by * 40 % ( data not shown ) . It is interesting to note that HUVECs within 324 ± 59 Pa ( n = 5 , 3 mg / ml ) collagen gels compact them to 33 ± 1 % of their original area ( Fig . 7 ) and also form extensive capillary - like networks . That the extents of compaction of self - assembling peptide and collagen gels are very similar under the conditions ‘‘optimal’’ for net - work formation suggests that the extent of matrix strain , possibly in the form of ﬁber alignment , as well as cell contraction , may be a principal factor in determining the extent of capillary morphogenesis .

Data ( n = 4 – 23 gels for each concentration ) of RAD16 - I ( dotted line ) or RAD16 - II ( solid line ) were ﬁt with power laws ( resulting equations shown in Table 1 ) Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 77 Discussion In this study , we investigated the ability of ionic self - assembling peptide gels to support capillary morphogenesis by human endothelial cells . These synthetic biomaterials have been proposed to have similar properties to natural ECM supports at the microarchitecture level . Further , they have been shown to support adhesion and differentiated behavior of a number of cell types [ 6 , 25 – 27 , 35 , 36 ] . In order to assess these materials with respect to more com - plex cell behaviors , we used a 3D assay of capillary - like network formation . We initially investigated the behavior of HUVECs in self - assembling peptide gels under cell and gel concentrations previously optimized for collagen - based models of capillary morphogenesis [ 17 , 37 ] . Additionally , previous studies demonstrating an inﬂuence of matrix stiffness on various aspects of cell function [ 17 , 21 , 22 , 38 , 39 ] , motivated investigation of the effect of changing the stiffness of self - assembling peptide gels by changing their initial concentration . While the role of stiffness in differ - entiated cell behaviors has been widely investigated , much less attention has been paid to this parameter when con - sidering synthetic biomaterial supports . The primary sequences of the two peptides investigated here , RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II , are similar and numerous cell types have previously been shown to interact favorably with both of them [ 6 , 26 , 27 , 29 , 35 ] . Here we report that they are extremely similar with respect to their ability to support capillary - like network formation as well as with respect to appearance of ﬁber architecture . While both peptides had fairly similar concentration versus stiffness behavior , there were differences in concentration versus elongation behavior . Interestingly , when we compare the average structure size of HUVEC in 3 mg / ml peptide gels , we see that it is approximately twice as long in RAD16 - I ( 115 l m ) as in RAD16 - II ( 57 l m ) . This concentration corresponds to respective stiffness values of * 440 Pa and * 735 Pa . In a separate study , where concentrations were chosen for an initial stiffness of * 735 Pa , HUVEC formed more comparably sized structures of 45 l m and 62 l m ( average ) in RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II , respectively . This observation is consistent with the conclusion that the initial stiffness of the self - assembling peptide gels is one of the determinants of HUVEC behavior . More speciﬁcally , the present results appear to demonstrate that HUVEC are able to form 3D , multi - cellular , capillary - like networks within RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II ionic self - assembling peptide gels , with softer gels favoring more extensive network forma - tion . This is consistent with previous reports that endo - thelial cells preferentially form capillary - like networks within more compliant 3D ECM gels [ 17 , 21 , 22 ] .

Scale bar is for all images . Fiber length ( E ) and thickness ( F ) were quantiﬁed in TEM images of RAD16 - I ( e ) and RAD16 - II ( j ) self - assembling peptide gels prepared at a range of concentrations . The resulting thickness to length ratio is shown ( G ) . Solid and dashed lines represent linear ﬁts of RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II , respectively , and are included to show overall trends 78 Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 Additionally , we demonstrate the formation of hollow vacuole regions , which have been shown by others to be precursors to lumens [ 34 , 40 , 41 ] . This observation is consistent with prior work , which histologically demon - strated hollow structures formed by endothelial cells within 10 mg / ml RAD16 - II although 3D network formation was not conﬁrmed [ 26 ] . While changing material stiffness by changing concentration is a simple experimental approach that has been used for ECM gels as well [ 17 , 22 , 42 , 43 ] and our results support an explanation based on stiffness , it is important to note that other matrix properties may also be changing with concentration . The ﬁber geometries are a clear example of parameters expected to change with concentration . Our observations of changing geometry with concentration have implications not only for cell - based studies such as this one but also for better understanding the later stages of the self - assembly process of these and similar materials . For example , based on molecular dynamics simulations and AFM investigation of dilute samples of RAD16 - II , the initial ﬁlaments formed by the 16 - amino acid peptides are thought to be approxi - mately 2 nm · 6 nm tapes [ 44 ] . Based on our observations of 30 – 40 nm wide ﬁbers , we believe that the initial ﬁla - ments bundle to form larger ﬁbers , which may be reﬂected in the increasing stiffness of gels within the ﬁrst few hours of formation . Additionally , from the thickness and length of ﬁbers , we can estimate volume fractions of * 0 . 02 – 0 . 07 , which are higher than volume fractions predicted from the concentrations ( 0 . 001 – 0 . 01 ) . One explanation for this dif - ference is that the ﬁlament bundling to form ﬁbers may leave room for water within the ﬁbers . Similarly , although we expect the thickness to length ratio to increase with the square root of concentration based on models of solid ﬁber networks , such as the cellular solids model [ 45 ] , we Fig . 5 Quantiﬁcation of structure sizes . Average structure lengths ( A ) and percent of single cells ( B ) of HUVECs cultured in RAD16 - I or RAD16 - II self - assembling peptide gels at the stiffness values indicated . Statistical difference for a given self - assembling peptide was determined using the Tukey – Kramer honest signiﬁcant difference test ( a < 0 . 05 ) , with ( * ) indicating difference from the 46 Pa gels , ( # ) indicating difference from 127 Pa gels , and ( % ) indicating difference from the 400 Pa gels . Structure length of HUVECs within 3 mg / ml ( * 324 Pa ) collagen gels was 2 , 161 ± 1 , 384 l m ; no single cells were observed ( not shown on graph because of different magnitude ) Fig . 4 Morphology of HUVECs within self - assembling peptide gels . Representativephotomicrographs of HUVECs at 5 · 10 6 cells / ml cultured within RAD16 - I ( A – C ) or RAD16 - II ( D – F ) at the stiffness values ( G 0 ) indicated and stained with rhodamine – phalloidin . Scalebar is for all images . Corresponding concentrations are as given in Table 1 Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 79 observe a much more shallow increase . Given that we observe such minimal changes in ﬁber geometry with an order of magnitude of change in concentration , one expla - nation may be that ﬁlaments are packing more densely as concentration is increasing . The changing properties of self - assembling peptide gels and ﬁber architecture clearly require more investigation to fully understand these observations . In addition to forming capillary - like networks within self - assembling peptide gels , we observed that HUVEC were also able to signiﬁcantly compact gels indicating that their adhesion to the materials was sufﬁciently strong for the cells to transmit contractile forces . We observed an increase in compaction along with the increased network formation accompanying decreasing peptide gel concen - tration . While this trend could simply be due to the increasing ability of cells to compact a more compliant matrix , we believe that matrix compaction may also be an important aspect of in vitro capillary morphogenesis based on previous work [ 17 , 37 ] . Further , trends of increasing matrix compaction and network formation with decreasing stiffness are seen in both self - assembling peptide and col - lagen supports , the initial stiffness values leading to opti - mal network formation are quite different . In a similar collagen gel system using endothelial cells exhibiting different capacities for force generation , it was previously shown that the balance between matrix stiffness and cell force generation , not the absolute magnitudes of either , is a primary modulator of capillary morphogenesis [ 17 ] . Cells can vary the force they exert on a matrix in at least two ways : ( a ) cells from different sources may exhibit different contractile capabilities [ 17 ] or ( b ) they may change their strength of adhesion to the matrix . Here we show that actin - myosin contractility is necessary for both self - assembling peptide gel compaction and HUVEC net - work formation within these gels . The effects of changing matrix adhesion strength on ﬁbroblast matrix compaction [ 46 ] and endothelial capil - lary - like network formation [ 37 ] have been demonstrated in studies where adhesion strength , and thus the cells’ ability to apply force to the gels , was decreased using anti - integrin antibodies . Differences in the relationship between extent of matrix compaction and initial stiffness for self - assembling peptide and collagen gels may provide indirect Fig . 6 Lumen formation by HUVEC in self - assembling peptide gels . High - magniﬁcation confocal images lumen formation by HUVECs cultured ( 5 · 10 6 cells / ml ) within 46 Pa RAD16 - I ( A ) or RAD16 - II ( B ) gels for 2 days and stained with rhodamine – phalloidin . Large panels are image slices in the x – y plane . Side panels show the y – z plane and bottom panels show the x – z plane of the regions indicated by the dotted lines in the x – y plane image . Z - stacks of images were obtained every 0 . 2 l m in the z - direction over 9 . 2 ( A ) or 13 . 4 ( B ) l m of thickness . Scale bar is for both images in x – y plane Fig . 7 Extent of gel compaction after culture . Percent original gel size after 2 days of culture of HUVEC within RAD16 - I , RAD16 - II , or collagen gels of varying initial stiffness values ( n = 5 – 6 gels ) . Statistical difference between different concentrations of each self - assembling peptide was determined using the Tukey – Kramer honest signiﬁcant difference test ( a < 0 . 05 ) , with ( * ) indicating difference from the 46 Pa gels and ( # ) indicating difference from 127 Pa gels 80 Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 evidence about the relative adhesion strength of HUVECs to RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II versus collagen . Based on the observation that compaction of * 400 Pa self - assembling peptide gels is much less than compaction of comparably stiff ( * 324 Pa ) collagen gels , we suggest that the adhesion strength of HUVECs to these self - assembling peptide gels is lower than to collagen gels . While cells bind directly to adhesion motifs on collagen ﬁbers , it is thought that cells attach to peptide gels via adhesion proteins that bind to the gels . Thus , adhesion strength to peptide gels could be affected by a number of factors , including surface area available for adhesion , ECM ligand densities , ECMs present and / or strength of mechanical coupling of ECM ligands to the matrix . Not surprisingly , the effect of stiff - ness appears to be a function of both adhesion strength and stiffness in various matrix supports . A question arising from consideration of the compaction of self - assembling peptide gels by HUVEC , or of any matrix by any cell type , is why the cells stop compacting . It is possible that the cells are attempting to create an ideal stiffness , cell density , or matrix ﬁber density . It is also possible that at some point they are unable to exert enough force to continue the compaction . Using the size data to estimate the ﬁnal volumes and concentrations of gels , assuming no material is lost , yields values for the ﬁnal concentrations of RAD16 - I and RAD16 - II gels of 7 . 6 ± 2 . 6 and 7 . 8 ± 2 . 0 mg / ml across all initial concen - trations used . This surprising result may indicate that in this system cells stop contracting the gel at a similar ﬁber density or stiffness , although we cannot yet address the underlying reason . The increased elongation in softer gels versus stiff gels , despite apparently similar ﬁnal concen - trations , may be due to the closer proximity of cells in more - compacted soft gels . However , it should be noted that initially seeding cells at very high density leads to high levels of compaction but does not promote network for - mation in collagen [ 17 ] or self - assembling peptide ( results not shown ) gels , indicating that cell density is not sufﬁcient to drive capillary morphogenesis . Although we are only directly changing and measuring the initial concentration of gels , and the gel stiffness likely changes with compac - tion , these changes clearly have an effect on the cellular microenvironment that favors capillary morphogenesis . While changing peptide concentration dramatically affects the stiffness of the resulting self - assembling peptide gels , the ﬁber geometry ( surface area , pore size , etc . ) may also be changing . Clearly , changes in ligand density would also affect the extent of capillary - like network formation , as has been shown in a 2D system [ 47 ] . However , based on our observation that over the concentration range investigated ( 1 – 3 mg / ml ) , while stiffness changed * 16 - fold , ﬁber diameter , ﬁber length , and pore size at most a few percent ( Fig . 3 ) . Our current experimental setup does not allow us to independently vary stiffness and adhesion site density , thus we cannot rule out that these changes did not affect the differential binding of adhesion proteins with changing concentration . However , given the minimal changes in ﬁber geometry and large changes in stiffness over the range of concentrations investigated , we believe that stiffness of self - assembling peptide gels a primary role in driving capillary - like network formation in self - assembling peptide gels . The process of capillary morphogenesis involves not only elongation of endothelial cells , but also likely involves their migration through self - assembling peptide gels towards each other . This raises the idea of the importance of ﬁber architecture—ﬁber and pore size—in making a material permissive for cell movement . Clearly , a material must either have pore sizes sufﬁciently large to allow cells to pass , be susceptible to enzymatic degradation [ 48 , 49 ] , or be able to be mechanically disrupted by the cells . Although there is regional variation , the pores of the self - assembling peptides investigated here appear to be on the order of 500 nm ( Fig . 3 ) , suggesting that the pores are too small for cells to squeeze through . Although there are no known enzymatic degradation sites present within the sequence of the self - assembling peptide gels and a variety of self - assembling peptide gels have been shown to be highly resistant to proteolytic degradation [ 24 , 50 ] , we cannot rule out the possibility that cells are able to degrade the ﬁbers . Additionally , they may be able to move or mechanically disrupt ﬁbers in order to move through the gel . Regardless of the mechanism , the ability of HUVEC to migrate through self - assembling peptide gels is supported by preliminary observations that they also form three - dimensional capillary - like structures within 3 mg / ml RAD16 - I in a 3D monolayer invasion angiogenesis assay ( unpublished data , ALS ) . The ECM - like size of the self - assembling peptide gel ﬁbers and pores is likely an important aspect of these materials’ ability to support endothelial cell capillary - like network formation . Here we demonstrate that a synthetic ECM - mimetic biomaterial is able to support 3D capillary morphogenesis and that stiffness of these materials appears to be a major modulator of the extent of capillary - like network forma - tion . The observation of changes in capillary morphogen - esis within self - assembling peptide gels of varying stiffness are consistent with the idea of a balance between the cell’s ability to contract a matrix and the matrix’s ability to resist deformation , as previously described in collagen gels [ 17 ] . Here , the cell’s ability to transmit force to the self - assembling peptide gels appears to be decreased due to lower adhesion strength , thus leading to a lower initial stiffness necessary for optimal capillary morphogenesis . While the effect of self - assembling peptide stiffness on cell behavior is not necessarily surprising in the context of the work done with ECM supports , these ﬁndings highlight the Cell Biochem Biophys ( 2007 ) 49 : 73 – 83 81 importance of considering the biophysical environment that biomaterials provide to cells in applications which attempt to direct differentiated cellular behavior and sug - gest that self - assembling peptides are a useful material to consider for tissue engineering of vascular networks .
