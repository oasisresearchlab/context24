To characterize the complex transcriptome changes in the endometrium in the course of initial conceptus attachment , deep sequencing of endometrial RNA samples of pregnant animals ( n ¼ 4 ) and corresponding cyclic controls ( n ¼ 4 ) was performed using Illumina RNA - Seq . The obtained sequence reads were mapped to the porcine genome , and relative expression values were calculated for the analysis of differential gene expression . Statistical analysis revealed 1933 differentially expressed genes ( false discovery rate 1 % ) , 1229 with higher and 704 with lower mRNA concentration , in the samples from pregnant animals . Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real - time RT - PCR . The RNA - Seq data were compared to results of a microarray study of bovine endometrium on Day 18 of pregnancy and additional related data sets . Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the genes with higher mRNA concentration in pregnant samples strong overrepresentation , particularly for immune - related functional terms but also for apoptosis and cell adhesion . Overrepresented terms for the genes with lower mRNA concentration in pregnant samples were related to extracellular region , ion transport , cell adhesion , and lipid and steroid metabolic process . In conclusion , RNA - Seq analysis revealed comprehensive transcriptome differences in porcine endometrium between Day 14 of pregnancy and corresponding cyclic endometrium and highlighted new processes and path - ways probably involved in regulation of noninvasive implanta - tion in the pig . Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx , pig , Sus scrofa , swine , uterus INTRODUCTION Establishment of pregnancy in pigs requires conceptus secretion of estrogen starting on Days 11 – 12 after estrus , the period of trophoblastic elongation [ 1 – 3 ] . Conceptus estrogen produced between Days 11 and 16 elicits a change in the direction of prostaglandin F2 alpha ( PGF2a ) secretion from endocrine to exocrine , resulting in sequestering PGF2a within the uterine lumen and consequently in prevention of luteolysis [ 4 ] . This model has been modified recently by the finding that conceptus and endometrial prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) influences prostaglandin ( PG ) metabolism in favor of luteoprotective PGE2 [ 5 , 6 ] . For successful epitheliochorial placentation starting on Day 14 of pregnancy , trophoblast elongation is an essential event , as it enables nutrient exchange by increasing the placental surface between the early developing conceptus and the uterus [ 7 ] . This phase of extensive functional changes of the endometrium during the implantation period is accompanied by specific tissue remodeling at implantation sites [ 8 , 9 ] with an increased vascularization and vascular permeability at implantation zones [ 10 ] . With completely intact endometrial luminal epithelial ( LE ) cells throughout pregnan - cy , pigs show a true epitheliochorial placenta [ 10 ] . Until this time of development , the conceptuses are supported from the endometrium by histiotrophic nutrition . With ongoing placen - tation between Days 15 and 20 , the embryonic nutrition shifts from mainly histotroph to hematotroph and histotroph [ 11 , 12 ] . Elevated amounts of inflammatory mediators , which include both cytokines and growth factors , are associated with conceptus growth , implantation , and establishment of preg - nancy [ 6 , 13 ] . The porcine conceptuses and also the endometrium produce interferons ( IFN ) , which do not have an antiluteolytic function [ 14 ] . It has been shown that the pig conceptus trophectoderm expresses both type I IFNs ( IFN delta , IFND ) and type II IFNs ( IFN gamma , IFNG ) starting from Day 11 – 12 of pregnancy [ 15 , 16 ] with peak expression of IFND on Day 15 [ 17 ] . This results in increased expression of many IFN - responsive genes in the stroma and glandular epithelium ( GE ) that likely have a role in uterine remodeling to support placentation [ 14 ] . The limitation of induction of IFN - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) to the stroma is mediated mainly by the transcriptional repressor interferon - regulatory factor 2 ( IRF2 ) , which is up - regulated in the LE through conceptus estrogen [ 18 ] . IFNG produced by the porcine conceptus and also by endometrial NK cells is important for initiation of endometrial vasculature remodeling , angiogenesis at implanta - tion sites , and regulation of the maternal immune system [ 19 ] . In addition to the investigation of single - candidate genes and pathways , a microarray study of pregnancy - induced gene expression in the porcine endometrium on Day 14 after insemination has been performed by Østrup et al . [ 20 ] . The analysis of the obtained differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) assigned many genes to functions in the context of develop - mental processes , transporter activity , apoptosis , cell motility , signaling , cell proliferation , ion homeostasis , and hormone activity . Some of the identified genes were suggested to be involved in the process of placentation and in regulation of embryonic growth , such as interleukin 11 receptor , alpha ( IL11RA ) , and fibroblast growth factor 9 ( FGF9 ) genes , respectively [ 20 ] . The objective of the present study was the analysis of pregnancy - induced changes of gene expression in the porcine endometrium on Day 14 of pregnancy using next - generation RNA sequencing ( RNA - Seq ) to obtain a deep insight into endometrial transcriptome changes associated with preparation 1 Supported by the German Ministry for Education and Research ( BMBF , FUGATO - plus , COMPENDIUM ; BMBF network of competence PHE - NOMICS ) . 2 Correspondence : Stefan Bauersachs , Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis ( LAFUGA ) , Gene Center , LMU Munich , Feodor Lynen Str . 25 , 81377 Munich , Germany .

In addition , results were compared to a microarray study of bovine endometrium on the corresponding day of pregnancy ( Day 18 ) to identify common gene expression changes [ 21 ] . MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Animals and Collection of Endometrial Tissue Samples Treatments of gilts were approved and performed with permission of the local authorities ( District Government of Upper Bavaria ) . Experiments with gilts were performed in accordance with the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals , as proposed by the Society for the Study of Reproduction , with the European Convention on Animal Experimen - tation and with the German Animal Welfare Act . Prepuberal gilts ( crossbreeds of German Landrace and Pie´train ) obtained a single injection of 750 IU eCG ( Intergonan , MSD Animal Health Innovation GmbH , Schwabenheim , Germany ) and 72 h later 750 IU hCG ( Ovogest , MSD Animal Health Innovation ) to synchronize ovulation . Gilts of the ‘‘pregnant’’ group were inseminated twice ( 24 and 36 h after hCG ) with a standard dose of German Landrace semen , whereas gilts of the ‘‘nonpreg - nant’’ control group were inseminated with the supernatant of centrifuged ( 10 min , 3000 rpm ) semen of the same boar . Gilts were slaughtered on Day 14 after insemination . The uteri were removed , and each uterine horn was subsequently opened longitudinally at the antimesometrial side . Hyperemic zones , the sites of embryonic attachment , were visual in the endometrium on the mesometrial side . In pregnant sows , samples of the endometrium ( containing the lamina epithelialis , lamina propria , and tela submucosa but not tunica muscularis ) were taken from hyperemic zones ( see Supplemental Fig . S1 for examples of hyperemic zones ; all Supplemental Data are available online at www . biolreprod . org ) . Samples were taken from three locations of each uterine horn : proximal ( the end , close to the ovaries ) , medial , and distal ( next to the corpus uteri ) . Samples from the endometrium of the nonpregnant sows were taken from comparable locations . Tissue samples for isolation of RNA were immediately transferred to RNAlater ( Ambion , Huntingdon , Cambridgeshire , U . K . ) , incubated overnight at 4 8 C , and stored at (cid:2) 80 8 C until further use . Isolation and Analysis of RNA Total RNA was isolated from endometrium using TRIzol ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Purity ( based on 260 : 280 nm and 260 : 230 nm ratios ) and quantity of the obtained total RNA were measured by use of a NanoDrop ND - 1000 ( PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH , Erlangen , Germany ) . Integrity of the RNA was assessed by analysis on Agilent RNA Nano 6000 microfluidic chips with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Waldbronn , Germany ) . RNA integrity numbers ranged from 7 . 0 to 8 . 8 . Preparation of RNA - Seq Libraries Equal amounts of total RNA from samples derived from proximal , medial , and distal endometrial sections of one uterine horn were pooled for each animal . The mRNA - Seq sample preparation kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) was used for preparation of RNA - Seq libraries . Library preparation followed the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , poly ( A ) - containing RNA was purified with oligo - dT - coated magnetic beads starting from 5 l g total RNA and fragmented under elevated temperature using divalent cations . The obtained cleaved RNA fragments were reverse transcribed to first - strand cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) and random primers , followed by second - strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I and RNase H . The cDNA fragments underwent an end - repair process with T4 DNA polymerase , Klenow DNA polymerase , and T4 Polynucleotide kinase ; addition of a single ‘‘A’’ - base , and ligation of adapters . Ligation products were subsequently separated on a 2 % agarose gel ( Biozym Phor Agarose , Biozym Scientific GmbH , Hess . Oldendorf , Germany ) , and a gel slice was cut out ( X - Tracta , Biozym Scientific ) in the 200 - base - pair ( bp ; 6 25 bp ) range . After isolation of the DNA from the gel slice ( QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit , Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , cDNA fragments were amplified through 15 cycles of PCR ( Phusion DNA polymerase , New England Biolabs GmbH , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) to generate the final sequencing libraries . Concentration of the cDNA fragments was estimated on an Agilent DNA 1000 chip ( Agilent Technologies ) and with the Qubit Fluorometer ( Invitrogen ) . Sequencing of the libraries was conducted on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx system ( Illumina ) . Single - end reads ( 76 bp ) were generated using Cluster generation single read , cBot kit , and Cycle sequencing kit v4 ( Illumina ) . Analysis of Illumina Sequencing Data The obtained sequence reads ( Fastq files ) were analyzed with a locally installed version of Galaxy [ 22 ] . The sequence reads were trimmed from the 3 0 end with FASTQ Quality Trimmer ( v1 . 0 . 0 , window size ¼ 5 , step size ¼ 1 , maximum number of bases to exclude from window ¼ 0 , minimum score for window (cid:3) 30 ) and filtered for a minimal length of 30 nt with Filter FASTQ ( v1 . 0 . 0 ) . Reads were mapped with Tophat ( v1 . 4 . 0 ) to the porcine genome sequence assembly ( Sscrofa10 . 2 , August 2011 ) . Transcript isoforms were assembled using Cufflinks ( v1 . 3 . 0 ) and combined with the gene annotations from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) ( ftp : / / ftp . ncbi . nih . gov / genomes / Sus _ scrofa / GFF ) . Analysis of differential gene and isoform expression was performed with DESeq v1 . 10 . 1 [ 23 ] . Integrated analysis of different functional databases was done using the ‘‘functional annotation clustering’’ tool of the Database for Annotation , Visualization , and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) [ 24 ] . Graphical illustration of overrepresented gene ontologies and other functional categories was produced with the Cytoscape v3 . 0 . 0 . beta1 application ClueGO v2 . 0 . 0 . beta1 [ 25 ] . For characterization of the RNA - Seq data set and for comparison with related data sets of other species , Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA v2 . 07 ) [ 26 ] was used . For GSEA , all detectable genes were ranked on the basis of a score calculated from the fold change and the adjusted P value . This preranked list was used for the analysis with the GSEA Preranked tool . The data discussed here have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE43667 . Quantitative Real - Time RT - PCR Same RNA samples as used for RNA - Seq were used to validate the results by quantitative real - time RT - PCR ( qPCR ) , which was performed as previously described [ 27 ] . In brief , 1 l g of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis in a total volume of 20 l l with the Sprint RT Complete - Double PrePrimed mix from Clontech ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) , according to the recommendations of the manufacturer . To amplify specific fragments referring to selected regulated genes , specific primers were designed with NCBI Primer - BLAST ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . Real - time PCR reactions were performed in a 20 l l reaction mixture ( 1 l l of cDNA , 1 l M forward and reverse primer , and 1 3 Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix [ ABI , Carlsbad , CA ] ) using a real - time StepOne instrument [ ABI ] ) . For all reactions , the annealing temperature was 60 8 C . Ubiquitin B , GAPDH , and RN18S were used as reference genes , which previously have been used in bovine and equine endometrium [ 28 , 29 ] . Relative expression levels of the selected target genes were calculated with the 2 ( - Delta Delta C [ T ] ) method [ 30 ] . The cycle thresholds determined for the target genes were normalized against the geometric mean of the reference genes . All PCR fragments were analyzed on a DNA1000 Labchip ( Agilent Technologies ) to check amplification of a single product and sequenced to verify the obtained PCR product . RESULTS RNA Sequencing of Porcine Endometrial Tissue Samples RNA - Seq libraries were prepared for pregnant gilts ( n ¼ 4 ) and nonpregnant gilts ( n ¼ 4 ) . Each library was analyzed on one lane of a single - read flow cell , resulting in 25 – 36 million raw reads and 20 – 26 quality - filtered reads per library . The correlation heat map of normalized read count data produced by DEseq ( Fig . 1a ) revealed good correlation of expression data within groups and low correlation between pregnant and control groups . At a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 1 % , 1933 DEG were obtained , 1229 with higher and 704 with lower expression levels , in the samples from pregnant gilts compared to the nonpregnant controls ( see Volcano plot , Fig . 1b and Supplemental Table S2 ) . To get an indication for localization of expression of the obtained DEG , a search in the data downloaded from the ‘‘The Human Protein Atlas’’ project was performed [ 31 ] . The results from this search are included in Supplemental Table S2 . SAMBORSKI ET AL . 2 Article 84 Comparison to a Microarray Data Set and Validation of RNA - Seq Results by qPCR The obtained RNA - Seq expression data were at first compared to the results of a previous microarray study of porcine endometrium samples collected from Day 14 pregnant sows and corresponding cyclic controls [ 20 ] using GSEA . This analysis revealed a good correlation of the RNA - Seq data set and the DEG , which have been identified in the microarray study ( Fig . 2 , left ) . This is indicated by the enrichment of the up - regulated genes of the microarray study to the left side ( black vertical lines ) of the ranked RNA - Seq data set ( up - regulated genes left , down - regulated genes right ) and the enrichment of down - regulated genes to the right side . Ten genes were selected for relative gene expression quantification by qPCR based on findings in the previous microarray study of porcine endometrium on Day 14 of pregnancy and known or inferred gene functions . The obtained qPCR results agreed well with the RNA - Seq data ( Table 1 , first 10 genes ) . In addition , two genes ( EPS8 - like 3 , EPS8L3 ; membrane protein , palmitoylated 3 , MPP3 ) were selected since relatively low and variable numbers of reads were found for these genes ( 0 – 157 reads ) , and good adjusted P values were obtained with a former version of DEseq but poor adjusted P values with the current version . The qPCR confirmed the obtained fold changes . For MPP3 , the difference obtained from qPCR was also not significant ( P ¼ 0 . 064 ) . An additional six genes were investigated based on the results of the comparison of the RNA - Seq data to the microarray data set ( last six genes in Table 1 ) ; that is , genes were selected that were significant in the microarray study but not in the RNA - Seq analysis . For these genes , the qPCR confirmed the results obtained with RNA - Seq . Overall , the observed expression changes ( log2 - fold changes ) were more similar between RNA - Seq and qPCR data ( Table 1 ) . Bioinformatics Analysis of RNA - Seq Data GSEA was used to characterize the RNA - Seq data set by comparison to gene sets of the GSEA database and selected related data sets . Figure 2 ( right ) shows the results for gene sets containing interferon gamma ( IFNG ) - induced genes [ 32 ] and IFN alpha ( IFNA ) - induced genes [ 33 ] . These gene sets showed strong enrichment toward genes with higher expression levels , indicating up - regulation of ISGs in Day 14 pregnant porcine endometrium . Furthermore , Figure 3a shows the GSEA plots for the comparison to genes up - regulated in bovine endome - FIG . 1 . Distance heat map ( a ) and volcano plot ( b ) obtained from DESeq analysis . Filtered ( at least 10 reads for a gene in three of four samples of at least one group ) and normalized data were used for calculation of pairwise distances and drawing a distance heat map ( a ) by the use of DESeq v1 . 10 . 1 . Each column represents one sample and shows the correlation to all samples ( including itself ) with red for the lowest ( 0 ) distance and blue for the highest observed distance . Log 2 fold changes pregnant versus control were plotted against base mean values ( normalized expression values ) . Significant ( adjusted P value , 0 . 01 ) transcripts are shown in red . FIG . 2 . Results of GSEA . A preranked list of all expressed genes ( nonredundant human gene symbols ) was used for GSEA and compared to gene sets of the GSEA gene set database c2 . all . v3 . 1 . symbols and selected published and own gene sets . Results for genes found as up - regulated or down - regulated in porcine endometrium on Day 14 of pregnancy in a microarray study [ 20 ] and for genes up - regulated after treatment with interferon gamma ( IFNG ) and interferon alpha ( IFNA ) are shown . RNA - SEQ OF DAY 14 PREGNANT PORCINE ENDOMETRIUM 3 Article 84 trium on Day 15 and on Day 18 of pregnancy and after intrauterine application of IFNA [ 21 ] . These gene sets showed also significant similarity with the RNA - Seq data set from porcine endometrium on Day 14 of pregnancy , that is , with the genes up - regulated in pregnant endometrium . In addition to the comparison with GSEA , the lists of DEG of the present study and the DEG obtained from bovine endometrium on Day 18 of pregnancy [ 21 ] were directly compared ( Fig . 3b , Supplemental Table S3 ) ; 180 genes were found as up - regulated in porcine and bovine endometrium and 34 as down - regulated . Only 25 genes that were differentially expressed in porcine and bovine endometrium showed regulation in the opposite direction . Figure 3c shows the same comparison confined to known or putative ISG ( see also Supplemental Table S3 ) . More than half of these genes were differentially expressed in both porcine and bovine endome - trium , with 85 genes up - regulated and three genes down - regulated in porcine and bovine endometrium . Only one gene showed expression changes in the opposite direction . A functional classification of the obtained DEG was performed with the DAVID ‘‘functional annotation clustering’’ and ‘‘functional annotation chart’’ tools ( Supplemental Table S4 ) . For the up - regulated genes , the majority of overrepresent - ed functional terms was related to immune functions , such as ‘‘defense response , ’’ ‘‘activation of immune response , ’’ ‘‘leukocyte activation , ’’ ‘‘leukocyte - mediated immunity , ’’ and ‘‘chemotaxis’’ ( Table 2 ) . In addition , overrepresentation of functional terms related to apoptosis , cell adhesion , cell motion , extracellular proteins , homeostasis , and proteolysis was found ( Table 2 ) . For the down - regulated genes , overrep - resented functional categories were related to lipid synthesis , cell adhesion , extracellular proteins , transport of ions , and endoplasmic reticulum ( Table 3 ) . A comparison of the DAVID result for typical overrepresented functional terms found for genes with higher expression and for genes with lower expression in Day 14 pregnant endometrium is shown in Table 4 . Functional terms related to lipid , sterol , steroid , cholesterol , and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism , sodium transport , the EPH / ephrin system , and extracellular matrix were specifically overrepresented for the genes with lower expres - sion in pregnant endometrium . Overrepresentation for both up - regulated and down - regulated genes was found for functional terms such as ‘‘cell adhesion , ’’ ‘‘integrin - mediated signaling pathway , ’’ and ‘‘response to steroid hormone stimulus . ’’ Most of the overrepresented terms specific for up - regulated genes were related to immune response . Additional terms specific for up - regulated genes were related to apoptosis , cell proliferation , peptidase and peptidase inhibitor activity , and transport . Furthermore , the Cytoscape plug - in ClueGO [ 25 ] was used to compare overrepresented functional terms / categories and pathways and to display networks of related terms found for all differentially expressed genes ( Fig . 4 ) . Functional categories specific for up - regulated genes are shown in red , categories specific for down - regulated genes in blue , and common TABLE 1 .

FIG . 3 . Comparison to bovine endometrium . GSEA was used to compare the porcine RNA - Seq data set with differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) obtained in a study of bovine endometrium [ 21 ] on Days 15 and 18 of pregnancy and after intrauterine application of human interferon alpha ( IFNA ) ( a ) . Furthermore , obtained DEG for Day 14 pregnant porcine and Day 18 pregnant bovine endometrium were compared ( b ) . In addition , known and putative IFN - regulated genes were compared for Day 14 pregnant porcine and Day 18 pregnant bovine endometrium ( c ) . Numbers in brackets are the genes with opposite regulation . SAMBORSKI ET AL . 4 Article 84 categories in light red or light blue . Terms with the highest percentage of associated genes ( highest overrepresentation / fold enrichment ) were ‘‘integrin complex , ’’ ‘‘cholesterol biosyn - thesis , ’’ ‘‘allograft rejection , ’’ ‘‘steroid biosynthesis , ’’ ‘‘bio - synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids , ’’ ‘‘neorotransmitter : sodium symporter activity , ’’ ‘‘ephrin receptor activity , ’’ and ‘‘response to IFNG . ’’ Expression of selected genes involved in pathways related to PG and E2 signaling and metabolism , such as steroid hormone biosynthesis ( SHB ) , arachidonic acid metabolism ( AAM ) , PG synthesis and regulation ( PGSR ) , estrogen signaling ( E2S ) , and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids ( UFAS ) , are shown in Table 5 . For the majority of these genes , lower mRNA levels were present in pregnant endometrium . Genes assigned to SHB are involved mainly in estradiol metabolism . Genes related to AAM are associated mainly with synthesis of eicosanoids other than PGs except for prostaglan - din - endoperoxide synthases 1 and 2 ( PTGS1 , PTGS2 ) . For PG regulation , a putative PGF2a synthase ( AKR1B1 ) was found as up - regulated in pregnant endometrium as well as a PG reductase ( PTGR1 ) .

RNA - SEQ OF DAY 14 PREGNANT PORCINE ENDOMETRIUM 5 Article 84 synthesis is the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids . The identified genes associated with this pathway showed decreased expression in pregnant endometrium except for ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 ( ELOVL6 ) . All genes found as associated with these pathways can be found in Supplemental Table S5 . DISCUSSION RNA - Seq was used in this study to get a comprehensive insight into differential gene expression in the porcine endometrium on Day 14 of pregnancy in comparison to Day 14 of the estrous cycle . Similar endometrial samples have been analyzed in a previous microarray study using the Affymetrix GeneChip Porcine Genome Array [ 20 ] . One major advantage is certainly the much higher sensitivity of RNA - Seq since 20 – 26 quality - filtered reads per library per sample correspond to a sensitivity of approximately one transcript in 2 million transcripts ( threshold used was (cid:3) 10 reads for a transcript ) , which corresponds to one transcript per 10 cells . This fact and the incomplete content of the Affymetrix porcine microarray is probably the main reason why in the microarray study , only 263 genes have been found as differentially expressed ( FDR 1 % , fold change (cid:3) 2 - fold ) but 1933 DEG ( FDR 1 % ) in the RNA - Seq study . Comparison of the data sets with GSEA showed a very good overlap for both up - regulated and down - regulated genes . In addition , this was confirmed by the analysis of selected genes with qPCR , which clearly confirmed the RNA - Seq data . Differences in the results of the microarray study and the present study were observed for a small number of genes that were selected from the results of GSEA ( genes differential with microarrays but not with RNA - Seq ) . For all of those genes , RNA - Seq results were confirmed by qPCR . For one of these genes , interferon - induced transmembrane protein 1 ( IFITM1 ) , the difference could be due to the fact that the corresponding Affymetrix probe set matches , in addition to IFITM1 , three other genes that are very similar or in part identical to IFITM1 . The primers used for qPCR were designed on the genome assembly Sscrofa 9 . 2 . In the current assembly ( Sscrofa 10 . 2 ) , the primers are located in two locations in the genome - amplifying fragments of the same size and sequence . Likewise , the RNA - Seq reads mapped to two locations in the genome . Hence , the observed differences may be the result of measuring different genes since RNA - Seq and qPCR measured two genes and the microarray probe set four genes . The observed differences for the other genes could originate from the sample collection since sows were used in the microarray study [ 20 ] and gilts in the present study . One limitation of the analysis of endometrial tissue samples is the complex and dynamic tissue composition . There are luminal and glandular epithelial cells , stromal cells , endothelial cells , and various immune cells . Particularly the latter can be very dynamic , resulting in gene expression changes due to TABLE 4 .

SAMBORSKI ET AL . 6 Article 84 infiltration of immune cells . This fact has to be considered for the interpretation of gene expression changes , which could be the effect of infiltration of the endometrium by immune cells , for example , as an effect of conceptus IFN secretion . To get an indication of possible localization of gene expression , data - bases for gene or protein expression in various tissues were analyzed . For some of the genes discussed later , this was supportive for a putative function of these genes regarding establishment of pregnancy and conceptus attachment . Comparison to Other Data Sets The comparison to the results of other gene expression studies by the use of GSEA revealed a significant overlap of gene sets containing ISGs with the genes up - regulated in pregnant porcine endometrium . Furthermore , the comparison to the DEG found in bovine endometrium on Day 18 of pregnancy [ 21 ] revealed that almost half of the overlapping genes ( DEG in porcine and bovine endometrium ) were ISG known from studies in cattle and sheep . Most of the remaining up - regulated genes were also related to immune functions and are probably stimulated by IFNs . This agrees with the finding that the porcine conceptus secretes type II ( IFNG ) and type I ( IFND ) IFNs between Days 12 and 20 of pregnancy [ 17 ] . Since IFNs in the pig do not have antiluteolytic properties [ 34 ] , this finding further supports the suggested general role of IFNs for establishment of pregnancy in pig and cattle and other mammals during the time of implantation and initiation of placentation [ 19 , 35 ] . Furthermore , the comparison of data from porcine and bovine endometrium revealed 34 genes down - regulated in both species . For these genes , overrepresented functions were found , such as ‘‘extracellular region , ’’ ‘‘extracellular matrix , ’’ ‘‘cal - cium ion binding , ’’ and ‘‘regulation of transcription . ’’ The genes coding for extracellular proteins have cell adhesion and immune functions . For example , EGFcontaining fibulin - like extracellular matrix protein 1 ( EFEMP1 ) , hemicentin 1 ( HMCN1 ) , and surfactant associated 2 ( SFTA2 ) are involved in regulation of cell adhesion [ 36 – 38 ] . Seven of the down - regulated transcription factor genes belonged to the class of homeobox transcription factors , three members of the HOXB family ( HOXB5 , HOXB6 , HOXB8 ) and msh homeobox 1 ( MSX1 ) . The latter is not contained in Supplemental Table S3 since the comparison to bovine endometrium was based on corresponding human gene identifiers , which lead to exclusion of porcine MSX1 since there are two genes similar to human MSX1 in the pig . One of these genes ( gene ID 100302364 , symbol MSX1 ) was 2 - fold down - regulated in pregnant porcine endometrium . The potential function of HOXB transcription factors in the regulation of the immune system was discussed previously [ 21 , 35 , 39 ] . Down - regulation of MSX1 has been found , in addition to bovine endometrium , in a number of studies of human endometrium during the window of implantation time ( reviewed in Bauersachs and Wolf [ 39 ] ) , in murine endometrium during implantation [ 40 ] , and in ovine endometrium after P4 treatment [ 41 ] . Localization of MSX1 expression in ovine endometrium has been shown in LE and GE [ 41 ] , which corresponds to the localization of protein expression found in the Human Protein Atlas ( HPA ; strong and moderate expression in uterine squamous epithelium and GE ) . This highly conserved expression indicates an essential role of MSX1 down - regulation for embryo implantation , and in FIG . 4 . Network of overrepresented functional categories for all differentially expressed genes . All significant genes ( human Entrez Gene IDs ) with at least 2 - fold higher transcript levels in pregnant endometrium were used as input for the Cytoscape 3 . 0 . 0 . beta1 application ClueGO 2 . 0 . 0 . beta1 . The following databases were used : Gene Ontology ( GO ) subgroups ‘‘biological process , ’’ ‘‘cellular component , ’’ ‘‘Molecular function’’ were selected . To limit the search results , the following parameters were used : GO tree levels : 2 – 8 ( first level ¼ 0 ) , minimal number of genes for up - regulated set : 15 , % genes : 10 , minimal number of genes for down - regulated set : 5 , % genes : 10 , percentage for specific cluster : 66 % , P value correction : ‘‘Benjamini - Hochberg , ’’ terms with P value , 0 . 01 , GO term fusion , GO term connection restriction ( kappa score ) : 0 . 35 , GO term grouping : initial group size ¼ 3 and 50 % for group merge . The resulting network was modified ; that is , many redundant and noninformative terms were deleted , and the network was manually rearranged . Node size was adjusted relative to percent associated genes . Edge line width was assigned in relation to the kappa score . Nodes are colored based on specificity : red for nodes specific for up - regulated genes , blue for nodes specific for down - regulated genes , and light red and light blue for common nodes / categories . Important overview terms ( node labels ) are highlighted in color corresponding to their specificity . RNA - SEQ OF DAY 14 PREGNANT PORCINE ENDOMETRIUM 7 Article 84 consideration of its function in development of endometrial epithelial cells [ 40 ] , a role in epithelial differentiation in context of placentation could be possible . GSEA revealed also a small number of gene sets with significant enrichment toward the down - regulated genes ( data not shown ) . These included genes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of cholesterol , steroids , and unsaturated fatty acids ( UFA ) . These pathways were specifically found for the down - regulated genes . For cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis pathways , genes assigned to almost all steps from 2 , 3 - epoxysqualene to cholesterol were found . Down - regulation of corresponding genes could be an indirect effect of conceptus estrogen on the endometrium due to the rapid metabolism of estradiol and estrone in porcine endometrium on Day 14 of pregnancy [ 42 ] , which provides precursor molecules for steroid biosynthesis . For example , hydroxysteroid ( 17 - beta ) dehydro - genase 7 ( HSD17B7 ) has been shown to be involved in biosynthesis of cholesterol and estradiol [ 43 ] . Genes associated with estrogen metabolism were also found as differentially expressed , such as steroid sulfatase ( microsomal ) , isozyme S , ( STS ) and sulfotransferase family , cytosolic , 2A , dehydroepi - androsterone ( DHEA ) - preferring member 1 ( SULT2A1 ) , which showed higher transcript levels in Day 14 pregnant endome - trium compared to cyclic controls . The second pathway , which was enriched toward the down - regulated genes , was the synthesis of UFA . Genes coding for various steps of synthesis of UFA starting from palmitoyl - CoA were found with lower expression in pregnant endometrium . Since one of the end products of this pathway is arachidonic acid , this finding could indicate a down - regulation of precursor synthesis for PG metabolism . The effect of dietary fatty acids on intrauterine synthesis of PGs during early pregnancy in gilts has been demonstrated [ 44 ] , suggesting an effect of reduced synthesis of UFA on PG synthesis , which could be involved in prevention of luteolysis .

SAMBORSKI ET AL . 8 Article 84 Overrepresented Biological Themes for Genes with Higher Expression in Pregnant Endometrium Genes related to immune functions . DAVID Functional Annotation and ClueGO analysis revealed for the up - regulated genes strongly overrepresented functional terms related to activation of the immune system . The comparison of the results obtained for up - regulated and down - regulated genes showed that all immune - related functional categories were specifically overrepresented for the up - regulated genes and significantly fewer genes or even no genes were found in those categories for the down - regulated genes . In the pig , both the endometrium and the conceptus produce IFNs ( IFND in the conceptus , IFNG in the conceptus and endometrium ) , and a fundamental role in the regulation of the maternal immune system and angiogenesis in the endometrium has been attributed to IFNG , the main IFN [ 19 ] . Consistent with the central immunoregulatory role of IFNG , genes for almost all ‘‘arms’’ of the immune response were obtained , which can be deduced from the overrepresen - tation of functional terms such as ‘‘innate immune response , ’’ ‘‘inflammatory response , ’’ ‘‘cellular defense response , ’’ and ‘‘lymphocyte - and leukocyte - mediated immunity . ’’ Since many of the up - regulated ‘‘immune response’’ genes are known markers of various immune cells ( e . g . , many T cell - and B cell - specific surface antigens and cytokines ) , this clearly indicates infiltration of the endometrium by immune cells , resulting in the ‘‘up - regulation’’ of corresponding genes . Analysis of databases for tissue expression revealed predominant expres - sion of typical CD molecules in uterine stroma and / or immune cells . Variation in the infiltration and distribution of different immune cells in the endometrium after insemination and during different stages of early pregnancy has been found in a light microscopy study [ 45 ] . Interestingly , the highest numbers of lymphocytes have been found on Day 19 of pregnancy in subepithelial stroma , whereas numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes in LE were lowest at this time [ 45 ] . Although most of the overrepresented terms were related to the activation of the immune response , a number of overrepresented terms also contained genes involved in negative regulation of immune functions , such as ‘‘negative regulation of immune system process , ’’ indicating a fine - tuned endometrial response to IFNs . The expression of cytokines and their receptors further indicates infiltration by immune cells but suppression of immune cell activation since a number of interleukin receptors were found as up - regulated but only two interleukins . One interleukin , IL15 , has been shown to bind to the same receptor as IL2 but has divergent effects and favors the population expansion of CD8 þ memory cells , NK cells , and NK T cells [ 46 ] . Interleukin 2 receptors beta and gamma were also found as up - regulated in Day 14 pregnant endometrium . Furthermore , IL10RA has been shown to mediate the immunosuppressive effects of IL10 by inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines [ 47 , 48 ] . Overall , the identified differentially expressed immune - related genes indicate infiltration of the endometrium by immune cells , particularly T , B , and NK cells , but suggest a ‘‘suppressed state’’ of these cells . Regulation of apoptosis . Categories related to regulation of apoptosis were also found as overrepresented . The genes assigned to these apoptosis categories indicate a tight control of this process since genes with proapoptotic as well as antiapoptotic functions showed higher mRNA concentrations in pregnant endometrium . Characteristic proapoptotic genes were , for example , apoptosis - inducing factor ; mitochondrion - associated 2 and 3 ( AIFM2 and AIFM3 ) ; BCL2 - associated athanogene 2 ( BAG2 ) ; BCL2 - antagonist / killer 1 ( BAK1 ) ; BCL2 / adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 ( BNIP3 ) , caspases 1 , 3 , and 4 ( intrinsic pathway ) and caspases 8 and 10 ( extrinsic pathway ) ; Fas ( TNF receptor superfamily , member 6 ; FAS ) ; and tumor necrosis factor ( ligand ) superfamily ( member 10 ; TNFSF10 / TRAIL ) . Antiapoptotic genes were B cell CLL / lymphoma 2 family ( BCL2A1 , BCL2L14 ) , baculoviral IAP repeat - containing 3 ( BIRC3 ) , and CASP8 and FADD - like apoptosis regulator ( CFLAR ) . Increased apoptosis in endome - trial stroma on Day 15 of gestation compared to Day 15 of the estrous cycle has been found in a previous study [ 49 ] . The highly significant overrepresentation of genes involved in programmed cell death could be due to effects of conceptus IFNs and estrogens and could play a role in endometrial remodeling in preparation for implantation and placentation . Cell adhesion . Particularly important for implantation and placenta formation are genes related to cell adhesion processes . Related categories were found as overrepresented for genes with higher expression in Day 14 pregnant endometrium as well as for genes with higher expression in Day 14 cyclic endometrium . Many of the up - regulated genes , which were associated with cell adhesion , corresponded to cell surface markers of immune cells , so - called CD molecules ( specific mainly for T and B cells but also for other leukocytes ) . Integrin - mediated signaling was also found as overrepre - sented for both up - and down - regulated genes . Five integrin alpha genes ( ITGA4 , ITGAE , ITGAL , ITGAM , and ITGAV ) and four integrin beta genes ( ITGB2 , ITGB3 , ITGB6 , and ITGB7 ) showed higher mRNA concentrations in pregnant endometri - um . ITGA4 and ITGAE can form heterodimers with ITGB7 , which are involved in the localization of leukocytes at mucosal sites [ 50 ] . ITGAL combines with ITGB2 to form the integrin lymphocyte function - associated antigen - 1 ( LFA - 1 ) , which is expressed on all leukocytes agreeing with localization of expression in human uterine stroma and in lymph node germinal center cells found in the HPA database . LFA - 1 plays a central role in leukocyte intercellular adhesion through interactions with intercellular adhesion molecules 1 – 3 ( ICAMs 1 – 3 ; see Entrez Gene entry for gene ID 3683 ) . Messenger RNAs coding for ICAMs 1 – 3 were also found as up - regulated in Day 14 pregnant porcine endometrium as well as the genes fermitin family member 3 ( FERMT3 ) and talin 2 ( TLN2 ) , which encode integrin coactivators associated with LFA - 1 [ 51 ] . Activation of LFA - 1 by chemokines has been described to lead to firm adhesion of neutrophils and other leukocytes on endothelia expressing ICAMs [ 51 ] . Likewise , ITGAM and ITGB2 form a leukocyte - specific integrin referred to as macrophage receptor 1 ( Mac - 1 ) , which is important for adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to stimulated endothelium [ 52 ] . The expression of the heterodimer of ITGAV and ITGB3 , also known as vitronectin receptor ( VNR ) , has been analyzed in ovine endometrium during the preimplantation phase . Expression was detected in LE and GE and endometrial stroma with strongest immunostaining on LE and stroma on Days 16 and 17 [ 53 ] , corresponding with low and medium ITGAV protein expression in human uterine squamous epithelium and GE and in uterine stroma , respec - tively , as found in the HPA database . As a receptor for osteopontin [ 54 ] ( secreted phosphoprotein 1 , SPP1 , 12 . 8 - fold higher in pregnant endometrium ) , VNR is discussed to play a role in embryo attachment to the endometrial surface prior to implantation [ 54 ] . Furthermore , integrins have been suggested to promote transforming growth factor beta ( TGFB ) activation in porcine endometrium and thereby to support embryo implantation [ 55 ] . A role of TGFB signaling is also supported by the higher mRNA concentrations for TGFB1 and TGFB2 observed in Day 14 pregnant endometrium compared to cyclic controls . RNA - SEQ OF DAY 14 PREGNANT PORCINE ENDOMETRIUM 9 Article 84 Integrins alpha 6 and 11 ( ITGA6 and ITGA11 ) and integrin beta 4 ( ITGB4 ) showed lower mRNA concentrations in pregnant endometrium . The HPA database search indicated a localization of expression mainly in ( human ) uterine squamous and glandular epithelial cells for these three integrins . ITGA6 and ITGB4 can form a heterodimer that has been shown to promote invasive growth [ 56 ] . Further , silencing of ITGB4 in airway epithelial cells resulted in impaired antigen presentation and suppressed T cell proliferation [ 57 ] . These findings suggest a role of ITGA6 / ITGB4 in regulation of cell invasion and in signaling events involved in antigen presentation . Therefore , down - regulation of ITGA6 and ITGB4 gene expression in pregnant endometrium could support noninvasive implantation and modulation of the maternal immune system . ITGA11 forms a complex with ITGB1 and is involved in the recognition and organization of interstitial collagen matrices [ 58 ] . Alto - gether , the differential expression of integrin genes suggests the integrin - mediated signaling pathway as important for regula - tion of conceptus attachment and regulation / prevention of trophoblast invasion . Further genes with a role in regulation of cell adhesion are members of the mucin gene family . Here we found higher expression levels of two mucin genes , MUC4 and MUC16 , in pregnant endometrium on Day 14 . Increased MUC4 mRNA concentration on Day 14 of pregnancy is in line with a study of porcine endometrium during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy where MUC4 immunostaining decreased during early proestrus but remained abundant in the LE and GE of pregnant gilts during the time of conceptus attachment [ 59 ] . Results of studies in human endometrium indicate a role for MUC16 in the regulation of trophoblast adhesion and additionally in the modulation of maternal immune cells [ 60 , 61 ] . Overrepresented Biological Themes for Genes with Lower Expression in Pregnant Endometrium DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering and ClueGO analysis confirmed the results obtained from GSEA for the genes with lower mRNA concentrations in pregnant endome - trium on Day 14 of pregnancy ( see discussion above ) . The different groups of overrepresented functional terms were related to steroid and cholesterol biosynthesis / metabolism and lipid biosynthesis / metabolism , extracellular region / cell adhe - sion , regulation of developmental process , and ion transport . The processes ‘‘cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis , ’’ ‘‘bio - synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids , ’’ and ‘‘cell adhesion’’ ( integrin system ) were already discussed in the previous paragraphs . Fibroblast growth factor family . The group of genes coding for extracellular proteins contained , in addition to genes involved in cell adhesion , three members of the fibroblast growth factor family ( FGF7 , FGF12 , FGF18 ) . Decreased expression of FGF7 in Day 14 pregnant endometrium agrees with the negative effect of long - term estradiol treatment on FGF7 expression , which has been found in neonatal ovine endometrium [ 62 ] . In contrast , higher expression of FGF7 in porcine endometrium on Day 12 of pregnancy and after E2 treatment of endometrial explants from Day 9 of the estrous cycle has been observed [ 63 ] . This could indicate a specific role of the growth factor FGF7 , particularly during the time of conceptus elongation between Days 10 and 12 of pregnancy . FGF12 belongs to the group of small intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologues and has been shown to be involved in the regulation of NF - kappaB signaling in neurons [ 64 ] . Expression of FGF18 in the endometrium has not been reported to date . From studies in other tissues , particularly bone tissue , interaction of FGF18 with TGFB , insulin - like growth factor I , vascular endothelial growth factor , hedgehog , BMP , and indian hedgehog signaling pathways is inferred [ 65 ] . Binding of FGF18 to FGF receptor 3 has been shown [ 65 ] , which mRNA is also down - regulated in pregnant porcine endometrium on Day 14 . In contrast , FGF9 showed higher expression in pregnant gilts similar to findings from day 12 of pregnancy in equine endometrium [ 29 ] suggesting up - regula - tion by conceptus estrogens . EPH - ephrin system . The highest overrepresentation of the genes related to developmental processes showed the members of the EPH - ephrin system . The genes coding for EPH receptors EPHA1 , EPHB1 , EPHB2 , and EPHB3 and two ligands , ephrin A4 and A5 ( EFNA4 and EFNA5 ) , were found to have lower mRNA concentrations in porcine endometria from Day 14 of pregnancy . Expression of members of the EPHA family has been investigated in porcine endometrium during the peri - implantation period [ 66 ] . EPHA1 mRNA was found to have similar levels on Day 13 in pregnant and nonpregnant endometrium and increased expression on Days 18 and 24 of pregnancy . In human endometrial epithelial cells , expression of EPHA1 was detected , and functional studies showed a role in regulation of the endometrial epithelial cell barrier since interaction of EFNA1 and EPHA1 promoted intercellular dissociation in Ishikawa cells [ 67 ] . In general , the EPH - ephrin system has an important function in cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion and in the regulation of cell migration via interaction with a variety of proteins involved in other signalin g pathways , such as integrins , claudins , cadherins , and connexins [ 68 ] . In this context , down - regulation of the EPH - ephrin system could be a mechanism to control trophoblast attachment and prevent invasion through the endometrial epithelium . Some genes coding for interaction partners of ephrins and EPH receptors were also identified as differentially expressed in the present study . Claudin 8 ( CLDN8 ) showed lower and CLDN4 showed higher mRNA concentrations in Day 14 pregnant endometria . Expression of the tight junction protein CLDN8 has been shown to correlate with sealing of the paracellular barrier [ 69 ] . Up - regulation of CLDN4 in the endometrium during the peri - implantation phase has been found in various mammals [ 35 ] . In human endometrium , CLDN4 protein has been detected mainly in GE [ 70 ] , which agrees with data from HPA where medium expression was found in GE and low expression in LE . Two cadherin genes , CDH6 and CDH17 , showed also lower mRNA concentrations ( 6 - fold and 50 - fold ) in Day 14 pregnant endometrium . Studies of tumor cells revealed a role for CDH17 in enhancing invasive growth [ 71 ] . Three connexin genes—gap junction protein beta 5 , 31 . 1 kDa ( GJB5 , connexin 31 . 1 ) ; gap junction protein delta 3 , 31 . 9 kDa ( GJD3 , connexin 31 . 9 ) ; and gap junction protein delta 4 , 40 . 1kDa ( GJD4 , connexin 40 . 1 ) —were also found as differentially expressed ( higher in Day 14 pregnant endome - trium ) . Regulation of connexin expression in the context of embryo implantation has been shown in human and murine endometrium [ 72 ] . Altogether , differential expression of the discussed genes indicates a complex regulation of conceptus adhesion and regulation of noninvasive implantation in the pig . Genes involved in ion and nutrient transport . Regulation of uterine fluid composition is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and cellular metabolism and therefore also for embryonic development . In addition to the regulation of the epithelial barrier , uterine fluid composition is controlled mainly by specific channel and transporter systems . Most of the down - SAMBORSKI ET AL . 10 Article 84 regulated transporters were related to sodium , potassium and calcium transport . Highly overrepresented in the down - regulated genes was the category ‘‘neurotransmitter : sodium symporter activity , ’’ containing six members of the solute carrier family 6 . In contrast , the up - regulated genes of the solute carrier family code for proteins involved in transport of nutrients such as glucose , monocarboxylic acids , amino acids , amines , oligopeptides , organic cations , fatty acids , nucleoside , and iron and zinc ions . Some of the identified transporters have been described previously as up - regulated in porcine endome - trium during the preimplantation phase [ 73 ] . Collectively , very different types of transporters with respect to their substrates were obtained for the up - regulated genes compared to the down - regulated genes , indicating specific regulation by conceptus signals to modify transport processes in the endometrium and endometrial secretions according to the needs of the developing conceptus . Genes Related to PG Metabolism and Signaling A central role for the recognition , establishment , and maintenance of pregnancy has been assigned to PG metabolism and signaling [ 6 ] . Differential expression of PTGS1 ( 4 - fold up ) and PTGS2 ( 3 . 2 - fold down ) was found , similar to the results of a previous study [ 74 ] . Furthermore , a gene coding for a PGF synthase , aldo - keto reductase family 1 , member B1 ( aldose reductase ; AKR1B1 ) , showed a 3 - fold higher mRNA concen - tration in pregnant endometrium . This confirms the results of a previous study where a similar up - regulation was found in a microarray analysis of Day 14 pregnant porcine endometrium [ 20 ] . Strong expression of AKR1B1 has been shown on Day 13 of pregnancy exclusively in LE [ 75 ] , suggesting a possible role in the redirection of PGF2a secretion . Altogether , the majority of genes involved in arachidonic acid synthesis and metabolism showed lower levels in pregnant endometrium , suggesting a general down - regulation of the synthesis of PG precursor molecules . In the context of changes in PG metabolism in the endometrium during recognition of pregnancy around Day 12 of pregnancy , differential expression of genes involved in PG biosynthesis ( i . e . , predominantly down - regulation of genes coding for enzymes for PG precursor molecules ) could be a general mechanism to regulate PG synthesis and to prevent luteolysis . In conclusion , RNA sequencing of porcine endometrium collected on Day 14 of pregnancy and the corresponding day of the estrous cycle revealed a comprehensive catalog of transcriptome changes during the time of conceptus attach - ment . Comparison to differential gene expression in bovine endometrium on Fay 18 of pregnancy and to other data sets showed that many of the up - regulated genes are IFN - stimulated genes as an effect of conceptus IFNs . Bioinformatics analysis of the obtained DEG suggested a number of specific processes and pathways as particularly important for endometrial remodeling associated with embryo implantation and begin - ning placentation . In addition to genes involved in the regulation of the maternal immune system , a number of new pathways and genes were obtained involved in regulation of cell adhesion , cell migration and invasion , transport of ions and nutrients , and regulation of PG metabolism .
