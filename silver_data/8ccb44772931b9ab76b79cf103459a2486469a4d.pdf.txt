Among the many aspects involved in the interaction between nanoprobes and biospecimens , size plays an essential role . Although the in ﬂ uence of size on their internalization behavior and distribution in live cells has been extensively studied , how does the size a ﬀ ect penetration of nanoprobes into ﬁ xed cells remains unknown . We investigate here the in ﬂ uence of size on the penetration behavior of gold nanoprobes into ﬁ xed mammalian cells by dark - ﬁ eld microscopy and surface - enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS ) microspectroscopy . We show that 14 , 20 , and 29 nm nanoprobes can readily enter into methanol - ﬁ xed MCF - 7 cells , while 42 and 55 nm nanoprobes cannot cross the cell membrane . For 4 % paraformaldehyde - ﬁ xed cells , even 14 nm nanoprobes can hardly get into the cells , but after treatment with permeabilization reagents , 14 and 20 nm nanoprobes are permitted to enter the cells . These ﬁ ndings provide important implications in future design of nanoprobes for cellular immunostaining . ■ INTRODUCTION Nanoparticles ( NPs ) are typically in the size range of 1 − 100 nm . Their small size imparts physical / chemical properties that are distinct from those of the same material in the bulk form , making them highly attractive for use in various biomedical applications . 1 For instance , NP - based drug delivery and imaging systems have been largely developed in the past decades for disease treatment and diagnosis , showing enhanced therapeutic e ﬃ cacy and improved diagnostic accuracy . 2 In particular , optical nanoprobes based on noble metal NPs , quantum dots ( QDs ) , upconversion NPs , and carbon / silica NPs in combination with a ﬂ uorescence / electronic / photo - acoustic / Raman microscope may provide bright signals for highly sensitive and selective detection of analytes and have been widely applied in immunoassays . 3 Understanding the interaction between NPs and biosystems ( cell / tissue / body ) is of fundamental importance for rational design of nanoprobes and facilitating their e ﬃ cient applica - tions . 4 Among the many factors involved in the NP − biosystem interaction , size is known to play a key role . 2b For in vivo applications , size a ﬀ ects systemic biodistribution and metabolic kinetics of particles after intravenous injection : in general , larger particles ( > 200 nm ) mostly accumulate in the liver and spleen ; NPs with a size lower than 200 nm extravasate out of blood vessels and retain in the tumor interstitium owing to its leaky vasculature structures and the lack of a draining lymphatic system , that is , the enhanced permeation and retention ( EPR ) e ﬀ ect ; NPs smaller than 5 − 10 nm can pass through the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney and are quickly cleared from the blood . 5 When met with live cells , NPs are easily taken up by the cells through various endocytic pathways such as macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis , caveolin - mediated endocytosis , and so on . The in ﬂ uence of size on the uptake of NPs by cultured cells has been extensively investigated in recent years . 6 For example , Chithrani et al . evaluated nanoparticle entry into HeLa cells for Au NPs in the 14 − 100 nm size range . By inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ( ICP - AES ) detection and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) observation , the authors found that Au NPs of 50 nm had maximum uptake by Hela cells compared to the NPs with either smaller sizes ( 14 and 30 nm ) or larger sizes ( 74 and 100 nm ) . 7 Later on , Lu et al . evaluated cellular uptake of FITC - labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs ) in the size range of 30 − 280 nm . Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP − MS ) were employed to investigate the particle internalization , showing highly particle size - dependent cellular uptake in the order 50 > 30 > 110 > 280 > 170 nm . 8 These ﬁ ndings suggest that NPs with a diameter of 50 nm may be the most suitable candidate to serve as a carrier or nanoprobe for live cell studies . On the other hand , nanoprobes have shown great advantages in immunostaining of ﬁ xed cells / tissue specimens in terms of sensitivity , stability , and multiplexing capacity . 9 In an immunocytochemistry process , ﬁ xation and permeabiliza - tion of cells are usually necessary before treatment with antibodies to determine the location of antigens within the Received : November 8 , 2020 Accepted : January 14 , 2021 Published : January 28 , 2021 Article http : / / pubs . acs . org / journal / acsodf © 2021 The Authors .

Solvents such as alcohols and acetone are strong coagulants and simultaneous permeabilization agents , with which proteins are precipitated , carbohydrates and nucleic acids are removed by washing , and lipids in both the membranes and cytoplasm are solubilized and extracted . Formaldehyde crosslinks proteins by addition to amino , amido , guanidino , thiol , phenolic , imidazolyl , and indolyl groups and forms chemically stable methylene bridges . It is also a good ﬁ xative for membrane lipids , and therefore , an additional permeabilization step is usually required to render the membrane permeable to antibodies . Glutaraldehyde is very e ﬀ ective in preserving the ﬁ ne structure and is usually paired with osmium tetroxide post ﬁ xation to provide excellent cytological preservation for electron microscopy , but it often results in lowered protein antigenicity . 11 Di ﬀ erent from the endocytic pathways involved in live cells , NPs enter into ﬁ xed cells mainly by di ﬀ usion since the proteins are ﬁ xed and lose their biological activities and the lipids are partially dissolved during the permeabilization process , leaving some pores in the membrane . NPs are typically larger than antibodies , and therefore , one would ask whether NPs can enter into ﬁ xed cells during the immunostaining process . However , as far as we know , the in ﬂ uence of particle size on their penetrating behavior into ﬁ xed cells has not been explored . In this study , we synthesized Au NPs with di ﬀ erent sizes ( 14 , 20 , 29 , 42 , and 55 nm ) to study the size e ﬀ ect on their permeability into ﬁ xed cells . We select Au NPs as the model system because ( 1 ) the size of Au NPs can be well controlled ; 12 ( 2 ) Au NPs as one kind of plasmonic - active NPs have been increasingly applied in various immunoanalyt - ical assays ; 3b and ( 3 ) Au NPs can be used as metal substrates to produce surface - enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS ) signals Scheme 1 .

TEM allows direct visualization of intracellular metal NPs due to their high electron density but is rather low throughput since it necessitates time - consuming processing of the samples and requires many images taken from a large number of sliced cells to obtain signi ﬁ cant results . 6a In contrast , dark - ﬁ eld microscopy allows in situ observation of intracellular metal NPs in a global view , and SERS scanning performed in the Raman mapping mode provides a spectrally resolved detection of NPs at each pixel in single cells . For fabricating the nanoprobes , we labeled the Au NPs with Raman reporter molecules ( 4 - nitrothiobenzoate [ 4 - NTB ] or 7 - mercapto - 4 - methylcoumarin [ MMC ] ) , encapsulated them with a polydopamine ( PDA ) layer for stabilization , and then blocked with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . The Au nanop - robes were incubated with cultured cells ( MCF - 7 , T47D , and HEK293 ) ﬁ xed with either methanol or 4 % PFA . After a short incubation with a Au growth solution composed of tetrachloroauric acid and hydroxylamine hydrochloride , the cells were observed using bright - ﬁ eld ( BF ) microscopy , dark - ﬁ eld microscopy , and Raman microspectroscopy ( Scheme 1 ) . We found that 14 , 20 , and 29 nm NPs penetrated into methanol - ﬁ xed cells more easily than PFA - ﬁ xed cells since methanol as an organic solvent may permeabilize cell membranes at the same time of ﬁ xation . However , with the help of permeabilization detergents such as digitonin , Tween 20 , and Triton X - 100 , 14 and 20 nm nanoprobes were permitted to enter the PFA - ﬁ xed cells . ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis of Nanoprobes . Monodisperse citrate - stabi - lized Au NPs of di ﬀ erent sizes were synthesized via a seed - mediated growth method . TEM images and UV − Vis spectra of the NPs are shown in Figure 1A , B , respectively . With the increasing of the particle diameter from 14 to 55 nm , the maximum extinction peak shifted from 520 to 534 nm . The NPs were modi ﬁ ed with 4 - NTB , a typical Raman reporter molecule which produces a strong characteristic peak at 1339 cm − 1 . Then , dopamine was added to form a thin encapsulating layer of PDA outside the NP , which protects Raman reporter molecules from releasing and simultaneously provides catechol moieties for further conjugation with amine / sulfur groups of biomolecules . 14 After that , BSA was adopted as a model protein to modify the nanoprobes since it is frequently used as a blocking reagent in immunostaining . After encapsulation of the NPs with 4 - NTB , PDA , and BSA sequentially , a 11 nm red shift of the extinction peak was detected in the UV − Vis spectra ( Figure S1A ) and a 1 . 5 nm increase in the diameter was observed in the TEM image ( Figure S1B ) , con ﬁ rming the successful modi ﬁ cation of the NPs . The SERS spectra of the nanoprobes are presented in Figure 1C , showing a strong Raman vibrational peak at 1339 cm − 1 for the 55 nm nanoprobes . However , with the decreasing of the particle size , the SERS signals declined dramatically . This is because the intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁ eld is strongly dependent on the number of electrons excited and , thus , on the volume of the NPs . 15 For further enhancement of the Raman signals , a Au growth solution composed of tetrachloroauric acid and hydroxylamine hydrochloride was added to enlarge the particle size and produce gap - enhanced Raman signals . 16 As shown in Figure S2 , after adding the Au growth solution , the sizes of NPs increased obviously according to the TEM images , and the extinction peaks of the Au NPs red - shifted to 547 , 565 , 582 , 618 , and 687 nm for the 14 − 55 nm NPs , respectively . Meanwhile , an obvious rise in peak intensity was observed in the SERS spectra of the grown NPs ( Figure 1D ) . Penetration of Nanoprobes into Methanol - Fixed MCF - 7 Cells . After ﬁ xation of MCF - 7 cells with chilled methanol at − 20 ° C for 15 min , the cells were washed with PBS , blocked with 2 % BSA , and incubated with nanoprobes of di ﬀ erent sizes . As shown in Figure 2A , no obvious di ﬀ erence was observed in the bright - ﬁ eld images among the ﬁ ve samples ( images with higher magni ﬁ cation are shown in Figure S3 ) . However , after adding the Au growth solution for 10 min , the cells became apparently darker ( Figure 2B ) , especially for the cells incubated with 14 , 20 , and 29 nm nanoprobes .

We next performed SERS mapping to investigate the precise location of the nanoprobes inside the cells . As presented in Figure 2D , strong SERS signals were detected inside the cells incubated with 14 or 20 nm nanoprobes , showing that the nanoprobes penetrated into the cells . SERS signals can also be detected inside the cells incubated with 29 nm nanoprobes , but the signal intensity was weaker compared with that of the smaller ones . For the cells incubated with 42 nm nanoprobes , only a very weak pro ﬁ le can be seen around the cell . Almost no SERS signal was detected in the cells incubated with 55 nm nanoprobes . The bright - ﬁ eld images , dark - ﬁ eld images , and typical SERS scanning images of methanol - ﬁ xed MCF - 7 cells incubated without nanoprobes are presented in Figure S4 . No SERS signals were detected in cells either before or after adding the Au growth solution . We monitored the change in SERS signals in a single cell before and after adding the growth solution . Figure 3A , B presents bright - ﬁ eld images , SERS images , and representative SERS spectra of the 14 nm nanoprobe - treated cells before and after growth , respectively . Before adding the growth solution , no SERS signals could be detected , while after growth , strong SERS signals appeared in the same cell . Figure 3C depicts three - dimensional SERS scanning images of a cell at di ﬀ erent Z planes , showing that the 14 nm nanoprobes enter into the ﬁ xed cell . A majority of the nanoprobes are located in the vicinity of the cell membrane or nuclear membrane , and some nanop - robes entered into the cell nucleus . For comparison , we also performed 3D SERS scanning of cells incubated with the 55 nm nanoprobes , but no signals could be observed ( Figure S5 ) . Penetration of Nanoprobes into PFA - Fixed MCF - 7 Cells . PFA is another frequently used cell ﬁ xation reagent , which crosslinks amino groups without changing the tertiary Figure 3 .

The microscopy images are presented in Figure 4 . Very di ﬀ erent from the methanol - ﬁ xed cells , the PFA - ﬁ xed cell samples became only mildly darker after adding the Au growth solution for 10 min . In the dark - ﬁ eld images ( Figure 4C ) , a slightly stronger scattering was observed in the cells incubated with 14 nm nanoprobes compared to the other samples . SERS signals are also only observed in the periphery of 14 nm nanoprobe - treated cells , indicating that even the smallest nanoprobes used here can hardly penetrate across the cell membrane . The distinct behavior of nanoprobes in methanol - ﬁ xed cells and PFA - ﬁ xed cells may result from the varied membrane permeabilization by methanol and PFA . Organic solvents such as methanol and acetone can simultaneously ﬁ x and break the cell membrane , making the immunostaining process more simpli ﬁ ed . 18 The one - step ﬁ xation and membrane breaking process of the reagents is useful if the major protein systems in the cell are studied , whereas when it comes to studying less - stable intracellular antigens , this type of reagents may not be the ﬁ rst choice . Instead , PFA ﬁ xation in combination with permeabilization detergents is usually employed in this case . Detergents , such as digitonin , Tween 20 , and Triton X - 100 , can break the membrane by either dissolving the phospholipid or the cholesterol of the cell membrane . 19 Tween 20 and Triton X - 100 are nonselective . They interact with proteins and lipids to form pores and potentially remove proteins and lipids from the cell membrane . Digitonin can selectively only break cell membranes by combining with cholesterol or other β - hydroxysteroids . Therefore , we permeabilized the PFA - ﬁ xed cells with digitonin , Tween 20 , and Triton X - 100 individually using the commonly selected conditions and investigated the penetration behavior of nanoprobes into the permeabilized PFA - ﬁ xed cells . Penetration of Nanoprobes into Permeabilized PFA - Fixed MCF - 7 Cells . To investigate the in ﬂ uence of permeabilization detergents on nanoprobe penetration , PFA - ﬁ xed cells were permeabilized with digitonin , Tween 20 , or Triton X - 100 individually and then incubated with nanoprobes of di ﬀ erent sizes . Figure 5 presents the results of cells treated with 50 μ g / mL digitonin for 5 min . It can be seen that 14 and 20 nm nanoprobes can readily penetrate into the permeabi - lized cells since the cells became dark in the bright - ﬁ eld images and became bright in the dark - ﬁ eld images after adding the Au growth solution . Intense SERS signals were observed inside the cells incubated with 14 or 20 nm nanoprobes , while very weak or almost no SERS signals could be detected in the cells Figure 5 .

A similar phenomenon was observed in the cells ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA and permeabilized with 4 % Tween 20 ( Figure S6 ) or 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Figure S7 ) for 5 min , showing that the detergents form pores smaller than 29 nm in the cell membranes . TEM Imaging of Nanoprobes in Cell Slices . For direct visualization of the nanoprobes inside the cells , we incubated the ﬁ xed cells with nanoprobes , embedded , sectioned , and observed the cell slices by TEM . As shown in Figure 6A , for the 14 nm Au nanoprobes , no NPs were observed inside the 4 % PFA - ﬁ xed cells , but after permeabilization with digitonin , a number of nanoprobes were found in the cytoplasm ( Figure 6B , marked in red circles ) . In contrast , for the 55 nm Au nanoprobes , no NPs were found inside the cell even after permeabilization , with only one NP observed to be adhered on the outer cell membrane ( Figure 6C , marked in a blue circle ) . The TEM results are in consistence with the phenomenon observed by dark - ﬁ eld microscopy and SERS microspectro - scopy , but the latter two techniques are more easily performed and provide higher throughput of information . Penetration of Nanoprobes into Fixed T47D Cells and HEK 293 Cells . To investigate the penetration behavior of nanoprobes in response to particle size in other cells lines , the human breast cancer T47D cells and the human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells were ﬁ xed with methanol and incubated with nanoprobes of di ﬀ erent sizes . As shown in Figure S8 , a similar tendency was observed in T47D cells as in MCF - 7 cells , that is , 14 and 20 nm nanoprobes penetrated into the ﬁ xed cells readily and bright SERS signals were observed inside the cells ; 29 nm nanoprobes could enter the cells but with a lower amount so that the SERS signals were weaker , while the 42 and 55 nm nanoprobes could not cross the cell membrane . In the case of HEK 293 cells ( Figure S9 ) , SERS signals could be detected in ﬁ xed cells incubated with 42 nm nanoprobes and smaller ones , but the 55 nm nanoprobes cannot enter the cells . The di ﬀ erence among cell lines might be induced by varied protein and lipid compositions in the cell membranes of HEK 293 cells with the other two cancer cell lines . In ﬂ uence of Surface Modi ﬁ cation and Concentration of Nanoprobes . In the above - performed experiments , Au NPs were labeled with 4 - NTB to fabricate nanoprobes for SERS imaging . We also fabricated nanoprobes labeled with another Raman reporter molecule , MMC , and tested their penetration behavior . The peak intensity at 1588 cm − 1 was used to create the SERS mapping images . As shown in Figure S10 , SERS signals were observed in the cells incubated with 29 nm nanoprobes and smaller ones , in consistence with the results obtained with the 4 - NTB - labeled nanoprobes . In addition , we modi ﬁ ed the Au NPs of di ﬀ erent sizes only with BSA and then incubated them with ﬁ xed cells . Since there was no reporter molecule on the NPs , SERS imaging was not performed . The bright - ﬁ eld images of the cells are shown in Figure S11 . After adding the growth solution , the cells incubated with 14 , 20 , or 29 nm NPs became dark , while the cells incubated with 42 or 55 nm NPs were much lighter , indicating more penetration of the small - sized NPs . We also tested whether the size - dependent penetration e ﬀ ect occurs on speci ﬁ c targeting nanoprobes . Mucin1 ( MUC1 ) is a glycoprotein overexpressed in most of the breast cancer cells . 20 Figure S12A shows immuno ﬂ uorescence staining results of MUC1 in MCF - 7 cells . We modi ﬁ ed the Au NPs of di ﬀ erent sizes with aptamers against MUC1 to fabricate targeting nanoprobes and incubated them with methanol - ﬁ xed MCF - 7 cells . As shown in Figure S12B , C , 14 , 20 , and 29 nm MUC1 - targeting nanoprobes were able to enter into the methanol - ﬁ xed MCF - 7 cells , but the 42 and 55 nm MUC1 - targeting nanoprobes could only be bound to the cell membranes . This experiment indicates that even for the speci ﬁ c targeting nanoprobes , the NP sizes play an important role in their penetration behaviors . As detailed in the experimental part , in the abovementioned experiments , NPs of di ﬀ erent sizes were adjusted to have the same surface area and applied for incubation with ﬁ xed cells . In this case , the concentration of smaller NPs is higher than that of the larger ones . To exclude the e ﬀ ect of varied concentrations , we adjusted the concentration of the nanop - robes to be the same ( 0 . 28 nM ) and incubated them with methanol - ﬁ xed MCF - 7 cells . As shown in Figure S13 , a similar tendency was observed as that before when the surface areas were kept the same : 14 , 20 , and 29 nm NPs were able to enter into the cells , but the 42 and 55 nm NPs could not , con ﬁ rming the size - dependent penetration behavior of nanoprobes into ﬁ xed cells . ■ CONCLUSIONS In summary , we fabricated Au nanoprobes of di ﬀ erent sizes , incubated them with ﬁ xed cells , and observed their location within the cells using dark - ﬁ eld microscopy and SERS imaging . We found that the penetration behavior of the nanoprobes is size - dependent and also relies on the ﬁ xation / permeabilization reagents . Nanoprobes up to 29 nm were able to enter the methanol - ﬁ xed cells ; in contrast , for the PFA - ﬁ xed cells , nanoprobes with an even smaller size ( 14 nm ) can hardly cross the cell membrane . However , after treatment with a permeabilization surfactant such as digitonin , Tween 20 , or Triton X - 100 , 14 and 20 nm nanoprobes may penetrate into the cells . The results indicate that the size of nanoprobes needs to be carefully considered in future NP - based immunostaining studies , especially for intracellular applications . ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Reagents and Instruments . Tetrachloroauric acid ( HAuCl 4 ) , sodium citrate , hydroxylamine hydrochloride ( NH 2 OH - HCl ) , BSA , dopamine , 4 - NTB , MMC , methanol , paraformaldehyde , Tween 20 , Triton X - 100 , and digitonin were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Ultrapure water ( Milli - Q , 18 . 2 M Ω ) was obtained from a Millipore water system . MCF - 7 , T47D , and HEK293 cells were supplied by American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , USA ) . DMEM culture medium , RPMI 1640 culture medium , and fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) were purchased from BBI Life sciences . The mouse anti - MUC1 antibody was purchased from Abcam , and the Alexa 555 - labeled secondary antibody was obtained from Thermo Fisher . The aptamer against MUC1 ( 5 ′ GCAGTT - GATCCTTTGGATACCCTGG 3 ′ ) was synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Co . The morphology and size of the NPs were measured using a transmission electron microscope ( JEOL JEM - 2800 , Japan ) . Extinction spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer LAMBDA650 UV / Vis absorp - tion spectrometer . Synthesis of Au NPs of Di ﬀ erent Sizes . Au NPs ranging in size from 14 to 55 nm were synthesized by citrate reduction and seed - mediated growth . 21 In brief , a solution of 2 . 2 mM sodium citrate in Milli - Q water ( 150 mL ) was heated with a heating mantle in a 250 mL three - necked round - bottomed ACS Omega http : / / pubs . acs . org / journal / acsodf Article https : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / acsomega . 0c05458 ACS Omega 2021 , 6 , 3791 − 3799 3796 ﬂ ask for 15 min under vigorous stirring . After boiling , 1 mL of HAuCl 4 ( 25 mM ) was injected . Immediately after the synthesis of the Au seeds and in the same vessel , the reaction was cooled until the temperature of the solution reached 90 ° C . Then , 1 mL of sodium citrate ( 60 mM ) and 1 mL of a HAuCl 4 solution ( 25 mM ) were sequentially injected ( time delay ∼ 2 min ) . By repeating this process ( sequential addition of 1 mL of 60 mM sodium citrate and 1 mL of 25 mM HAuCl 4 ) , up to ﬁ ve generations of Au NPs of progressively larger sizes were grown . The concentrations of the Au NPs were calculated by the extinction spectra according to the literature . 22 Fabrication of Au Nanoprobes . A total of 10 μ L of 4 - NTB ( 10 mM ) or MMC ( 10 mM ) in ethanol was added into 1 mL of Au NPs of di ﬀ erent sizes and incubated for 4 h . After that , the Au NPs were centrifuged and re - dispersed in 1 mL of Tris - HCL bu ﬀ er ( pH = 8 . 5 ) . Subsequently , 5 μ L of 5 mg / mL dopamine was added to the suspension and vortexed for 30 min . Then , the NPs were centrifuged and blocked overnight with 2 % BSA / PBS . For preparation of MUC1 - targeting nanoprobes , after dopamine encapsulation , the Au NPs were centrifuged and re - dispersed in Tris - HCL bu ﬀ er ( pH = 8 . 5 ) . Then , a 10 μ M SH - terminated aptamer was added to the suspension with a NP / aptamer ratio of 1 : 200 and incubated for 2 h . Finally , the nanoprobes were centrifuged and dispersed in 2 % BSA / PBS . Cell Culture . MCF - 7 and HEK 293 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . T47D cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . The cells were cultured in a 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 ° C . For the sake of dark - ﬁ eld and SERS imaging , the cells were seeded on coverslips and incubated overnight to adhere . After treating with ﬁ xed agents and permeabilization reagents , the coverslips were transferred to a 24 - well plate and incubated with nanoprobes . Incubation with Nanoprobes . The cells were ﬁ xed either with chilled methanol at − 20 ° C for 15 min or with 4 % PFA at room temperature for 15 min and then washed with PBS three times . For permeabilization , 4 % PFA - ﬁ xed cells were further treated with 50 μ g / mL digitonin , 4 % Tween 20 , or 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . Subsequently , the cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 2 % BSA / PBS for 2 h and then , 300 μ L of nanoprobes of di ﬀ erent sizes was added and incubated for 1 h . For comparison , either the surface areas or the concentrations of the NPs were kept equal . Speci ﬁ cally , the Au nanoprobes were dispersed in 2 % BSA / PBS , with OD = 0 . 5 for the 55 nm Au nanoprobes ( which is proper for immunostain - ing according to our previous study and the literature 23 ) and the surface areas of the nanoprobes of other sizes were kept equal to those of the 55 nm nanoprobes for comparison . In this case , the concentration of the NPs was 0 . 28 , 0 . 16 , 0 . 07 , 0 . 04 , and 0 . 02 nM for the 14 − 55 nm NPs , respectively . For equal - concentration studies , we adjusted the concentration of the NPs with varied sizes to be the same ( 0 . 28 nM ) and incubated them with the ﬁ xed cells . After that , the cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and Milli - Q water each three times . Finally , the Au growth solution was added and incubated for 10 min , and the cells were observed with a Zeiss microscope for bright - ﬁ eld images and a Nikon Ci - L microscope for dark - ﬁ eld images . SERS Measurements . SERS spectra ( 800 − 1800 cm − 1 ) were recorded on a Raman spectrophotometer ( Horiba HR evolution , 600 grooves / mm grating ) with a laser excitation wavelength of 633 nm ( HeNe laser ) . A 10 × ( NA 0 . 5 ) microscope objective , 13 . 4 mW laser beam , and 10 s acquisition time were applied to measure the solution samples . A 50 × ( NA 0 . 5 ) microscope objective and 5 . 4 mW laser beam were used for Raman imaging of the cells . The mapping images were acquired at an interval of 1 μ m with an acquisition time of 0 . 05 s . For three - dimensional SERS scanning , di ﬀ erent Z planes ( − 15 − 15 μ m ) were scanned with an interval of 2 μ m . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Staining . Methanol - ﬁ xed MCF - 7 cells were washed with PBS three times , blocked with 2 % BSA / PBS for 2 h , and then incubated with the primary mouse anti - MUC1 antibody ( 1 : 150 dilution ) overnight at 4 ° C . Then , the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the Alexa555 - labeled secondary antibody ( 1 : 300 dilution ) for 30 min at RT . After that , the cells were washed with PBS and treated with DAPI as a nuclear counterstain . TEM Imaging of Cell Slices . MCF - 7 cells were trypsi - nized , centrifuged , and ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA . The cells were divided to three aliquots . One was incubated with 14 nm Au nanoprobes and the other two were treated with 50 μ g / mL digitonin for 5 min and then incubated with 14 and 55 nm Au nanoprobes individually . After removing the free nanoprobes by centrifugation , the cells were washed with PBS and dehydrated in an alcohol series , embedded in Epon , and sliced to a thickness of 70 nm . Images of the slices were taken with a HITACHI H - 7650 transmission electron microscope . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * s ı Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https : / / pubs . acs . org / doi / 10 . 1021 / acsomega . 0c05458 .
