The role of coﬁlin - 2 in muscle development and function is unclear . In humans , recessive coﬁlin - 2 mutations have been associated with nemaline myopathy with minicores . To investigate the functional role of coﬁlin - 2 in vivo , we generated constitutive and muscle - speciﬁc coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice using a cre – loxP strategy . Coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice were similar to their wild - type ( WT ) littermates at birth , but died by day 8 . They were signiﬁcantly smaller , severely weak and had very little milk in their stomachs . The sarcomeric structure was intact at birth , but by Day 7 , skeletal muscles showed severe sarcomeric disruptions starting at the Z - line , along with ﬁlament - ous actin accumulations consistent with a lack of actin depolymerization activity . Coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient muscles contained elevated numbers of slow ﬁbers and exhibited upregulation of slow ﬁber - speciﬁc genes . Increased amounts of other sarcomeric proteins including a - actinin - 2 , a - sarcomeric actin and tropomyosin were also present . While destrin was not expressed in either WT or coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient muscles , coﬁlin - 1 was similarly expressed in developing myoﬁbers of both genotypes . There was no evidence for compensatory changes in expression of either family member in coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient tissues . The onset of pathology and weakness in coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient muscles correlated with normal developmental loss of coﬁlin - 1 expression within myo - ﬁbers , suggesting that coﬁlin - 1 serves as an early developmental sarcomeric isoform . Overall , coﬁlin - 2 , although not critical for muscle development , is essential for muscle maintenance . INTRODUCTION Coﬁlin - 2 is a small actin - binding protein ( mol . wt . 18 . 7 kDa ) , encoded by the CFL2 gene on human chromo - some 14q12 ( MIM 601443 ) . It is a member of the AC group of proteins that include coﬁlin - 1 ( encoded by CFL1 ) , coﬁlin - 2 and destrin ( encoded by DSTN ) , formerly called actin depolymerization factor . AC proteins are critical in the regulation of actin ﬁlament dynamics in eukaryotes where they function by modulating actin depolymerization and severing ( 1 ) . They are ubiquitously present throughout eukaryotes , with one AC protein identiﬁed in yeast , two in nematodes and three in mammals . The exact function of coﬁlin - 2 is unknown , but a critical role for coﬁlin - 2 in skel - etal muscle function was demonstrated by identiﬁcation of recessive CFL2 mutations in two families with congenital myopathies characterized by the presence of nemaline rods and minicores ( 2 ) . ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed at : Children’s Hospital Boston , Genetics , 300 Longwood Ave . , Boston , MA , USA .

Human CFL2 has four exons with four transcripts resulting from the variable use of the 5 ′ and 3 ′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) . Murine Cﬂ2 in comparison has four exons , but only two transcripts of 1 . 8 and 3 kb due to a variable 3 ′ UTR . The 1 . 8 kb transcript is present in the embryonic day ( E ) 13 , peaks in both the cardiac and skeletal muscles at birth and gradually reduces thereafter , still present at 2 months of age . In comparison , the 3 kb transcript is present only in the skeletal muscles , and its levels go up as the 1 . 8 kb transcript levels come down ( 4 ) . At the amino acid level , human coﬁlin - 2 is 99 % identical to murine coﬁlin - 2 and 81 % identical to human coﬁlin - 1 ( 3 ) . Functionally , among AC proteins , destrin is most efﬁcient in turning over actin ﬁlaments , while coﬁlin - 2 is least effective . In addition , coﬁlin - 2 has a 5 – 10 - fold higher afﬁnity for G - actin , promoting actin ﬁlament assembly and suggesting adaptation in muscle cells where actin ﬁla - ments are more stable ( 5 ) . Mutations of AC protein family members have been studied in Saccharomyces , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila and Mus musculus . In Saccharomyces , coﬁlin - null mutants are lethal and can be rescued by vertebrate destrin / coﬁlin - 1 ( 6 ) and Dictyostelium coﬁlin - 1 , but not coﬁlin - 2 ( 7 ) . Point muta - tions of UNC - 60B ( coﬁlin - 2 isoform ) in C . elegans cause defects in actin organization speciﬁcally within the body wall muscle ( 8 ) . In comparison , although viable , homozygous UNC - 60B - null mutants have a more severe motility defect than missense mutants ( 9 ) . The expression pattern of UNC - 60A ( coﬁlin - 1 isoform ) in this null mutant is similar to that in wild - type ( WT ) worms , suggestive of no compensatory mechanisms . In Drosophila , homozygous null mutation of the twinstar gene that encodes a homolog of destrin / coﬁlin leads to death of ﬁrst - instar larvae while hypomorphs had defects of varying severity including male sterility , abnormal centro - some migration and cytokinesis , semi - lethality and late larval / pupal lethality ( 10 – 12 ) . In Mus musculus , non - muscle coﬁlin ( Cﬂ1 ) has been targeted to create a null mutant . The homozygous null mutation was embryonic lethal while hetero - zygous mice were viable . Interestingly , there appeared to be a 3 – 4 - fold upregulation of destrin in the homozygous mutant but that was not sufﬁcient to rescue the phenotype . The pre - dominant defects involved neural tube morphogenesis , neural crest migration and misaligned somites ( 13 ) . A similar phenotype has been previously observed in several mouse mutants lacking molecules of the Notch signaling pathway , such as Notch , Delta 1 and RBP - JK ( 14 ) . Mice with autosomal recessive Dstn null and point mutations devel - oped corneal disease with roughened and opaque corneal surfaces , corneal stromal neovascularization and increased content of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) in the corneal epithelial cells ( 15 ) . The function of coﬁlin - 2 in vertebrates is not well known . Based on coﬁlin - 2 expression in mice , it has been postulated that coﬁlin - 2 may be involved in regulation of actin assembly during myoﬁbrillogenesis and actin dynamics in the mature muscle . Postulations about coﬁlin - 2 function vary from it being critical for myoﬁbrillogenesis , to the presumption that the effects of coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency may appear only in the adult skeletal muscle ( 4 ) . To understand coﬁlin - 2 function in the muscle , here , we report creating constitutive and muscle - speciﬁc excision of the Cﬂ2 gene in mice , leading to a mark - edly shortened life span , severe weakness and the presence of sarcomeric disruptions , nemaline - like bodies and actin accu - mulations within muscle ﬁbers . Expression of the coﬁlin - 2 paralogs , coﬁlin - 1 and destrin is essentially unchanged in the constitutive Cﬂ2 - knockout ( KO ) mice ( Cﬂ2 2 / 2 ) . Our data in - dicate that coﬁlin - 2 plays a critical role in skeletal muscle maintenance but not myogenesis in vivo . RESULTS Targeted disruption of coﬁlin - 2 ( Cﬂ2 ) The murine coﬁlin - 2 locus ( Cﬂ2 ) was targeted by homologous recombination using a vector subcloned from a BAC clone . A loxP site was inserted upstream of Cﬂ2 exon 2 and a loxP - ﬂanked neomycin ( Neo ) cassette was inserted downstream of exon 4 to generate a conditional mutant allele , allowing for excision of coﬁlin - 2 in a tissue - speciﬁc and constitutive manner ( Fig . 1A ) . The targeting vector was electroporated into C57BL / 6 embryonic stem ( ES ) cells under G418 selection and clones that underwent proper homologous recombination were identiﬁed and conﬁrmed by genomic polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and Southern blotting ( Fig . 1B ) . The targeted ES cells were microinjected into Balb / c blastocysts and chi - meras that transmitted the loxP / neo - coﬁlin - 2 allele ( Coﬁ ) through the germline were identiﬁed . Homozygous Coﬁ mice were obtained ( Fig . 1C ) and crossed with a strain that expresses cre controlled by regulatory sequences from the mouse zona pellucida 3 ( Zp3 ) gene that directs expression ex - clusively in the growing oocyte prior to the completion of ﬁrst meiotic division ( 16 ) . Females heterozygous for both Coﬁ and Zp3 alleles were bred with WT males to obtain heterozygous mice with exons 2 – 4 of the Cﬂ2 excised . The Cﬂ2 excision was conﬁrmed by agarose gel analysis ( Fig . 1D ) and sequen - cing of PCR products ( data not shown ) . Reverse transcriptase ( RT ) – PCR ( Fig . 1E ) and western blot analysis ( Fig . 1F ) con - ﬁrmed that coﬁlin - 2 was absent in several tissues . Tissue - speciﬁc Cﬂ2 excision was performed using skeletal muscle - speciﬁc ( Mef2c - cre ) ( 17 ) , embryonic striated ( skeletal and cardiac ) muscle - speciﬁc ( Acta1 - cre ) ( 18 ) and post - natal skel - etal and cardiac muscle - speciﬁc ( Ckmm - cre ) cre - expressing mice ( 19 ) . Early post - natal lethality of coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice The coﬁlin - 2 - null ( Cﬂ2 2 / 2 ) mice were indistinguishable from their WT littermates at birth and were born in expected Men - delian ratios , but by post - natal day ( P ) 7 , they were signiﬁcant - ly smaller ( Fig . 2A ) and none survived past P8 . The mean weights in grams at birth were 1 . 17 + 0 . 12 ( mean + standard deviation ) for the WT and 1 . 15 + 0 . 13 for the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( P ¼ 0 . 84 ) . At P3 , the mean weight of Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice was trending lower , although not statistically signiﬁcant ( 1 . 8 + 0 . 15 for Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and 2 . 1 + 0 . 22 for WT , P ¼ 0 . 11 ) . By P7 , the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice were signiﬁcantly smaller and weighed 2342 Human Molecular Genetics , 2012 , Vol . 21 , No . 10 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 21 / 10 / 2341 / 2900775 b y gue s t on 30 N o v e m be r 2018 less than half that of the WT mice ( Fig . 2B ) . From P3 to P7 , the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice gained only 0 . 3 g , while the WT gained 2 . 1 g . In addition , Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice were signiﬁcantly smaller in length compared with WT 40 . 6 + 0 . 81 versus 49 . 8 + 0 . 84 mm ( P , 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . They were unable to turn themselves when placed laterally and had markedly reduced spontaneous movements . Milk intake was evaluated to deter - mine whether it was affected due to the muscle weakness . A similar amount of milk was present in the stomachs of WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice on P1 and P3 , but by P7 , Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice had little or no detectable milk present suggestive of their inability to suckle ( Fig . 2D ) . Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Mef2c + ( skeletal muscle - speciﬁc coﬁlin - 2 - KO ) mice and Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Acta1 + ( embryonic somites and heart - speciﬁc coﬁlin - 2 - KO ) were very similar in presentation to the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice and died by P7 – 12 ( data not shown ) . To perform coﬁlin - 2 excision in muscles ( skeletal and cardiac ) later in development , Ckmm - cre mice were used , where cre expression starts at E17 , is (cid:4) 40 % of maximal levels at birth and reaches highest levels at P10 and stays high after that ( in rats ) ( 19 ) . Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice were signiﬁcantly smaller ( Fig . 2E ) , 2 – 4 - fold lighter than Coﬁ / + : Ckmm + controls ( P8 – 31 ) ( Fig . 2F ) and lived for 16 – 33 days ( Fig . 2G ) . Figure 1 . Targeting of the Cﬂ2 gene . ( A ) Targeting strategy to create Coﬁ ( conditionally targeted Cﬂ2 ) allele . An (cid:4) 10 . 4 kb region used to construct the targeting vector was subcloned from a positively identiﬁed C57BL / 6 BAC clone ( RP23 - 422H22 ) using a homologous recombination - based technique . The BAC was subcloned into an (cid:4) 2 . 4 kb pSP72 ( Promega ) backbone vector containing an ampicillin selection cassette . A pGK - gb2 loxP / FRT - ﬂanked Neo cas - sette was inserted into the gene . The region was designed such that the SA extended 2 . 0 kb to the 3 ′ end of loxP / FRT - ﬂanked Neo cassette . The LA extended 6 . 3 kb to the 5 ′ end of the single loxP site . The single loxP site was inserted upstream of exon 2 , and the loxP / FRT - ﬂanked Neo cassette is inserted downstream of exon 4 . The target region was (cid:4) 2 . 1 kb containing exons 2 – 4 . ( B ) Detection of WT and targeted alleles by Southern blot analysis . DNA isolated from electroporated ES cells was digested with Eco RI and analyzed by Southern blot analysis with a probe against 3 ′ external region ( PB1 / 2 ) as shown in ( A ) .

On P7 , the KO mice weighed less than half that of the WT ( P , 0 . 0001 ) . ( C ) The length of KO mice was signiﬁcantly less than that of WT littermates on P7 ( P , 0 . 0001 ) .

Control muscles were obtained from WT and various cre - expressing Coﬁ / + mice ( for muscle - speciﬁc exci - sion models ) . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining of muscles from all four Cﬂ2 - KO mice strains revealed balloon - ing degeneration of multiple myoﬁbers that were interspersed with relatively normal - looking ones ( Fig . 3B and F ) . Further analysis of frozen quadriceps sections from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice and their control littermates using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) staining showed pale core - like areas without staining within the myoﬁbers ( Fig . 3D and H ) consistent with myoﬁbrillar disruption and absent mitochondria . To evaluate whether myoﬁbrillar disrup - tion was ﬁber - type - speciﬁc , myosin ATPase staining was Figure 3 .

No obvious differences were noted between fast and slow ﬁbers in relation to the extent of disruption or percentages of disrupted ﬁbers . To determine the structure of coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient skeletal muscle in more detail , electron microscopy ( EM ) was per - formed on various muscle groups ( quadriceps , triceps , gastro - cnemius and diaphragm ) from the four KO strains and their littermate controls ( at P7 for Cﬂ2 2 / 2 , Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Mef2c + , Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Acta1 + and P21 for Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice ) . These mice exhibited severe disruption of myoﬁbrillar struc - ture including lack of well - deﬁned A - and I - bands alongside areas of relatively normal - looking sarcomeres ( Fig . 4C ) and normal - looking ﬁbers ( Fig . 4E ) . In areas of myoﬁbrillar dis - ruption , thick , irregular , electron dense structures resembling nemaline bodies were present ( Fig . 4D , F , I and J ) ( 20 ) . In some areas , Z - lines were noted to be dissolving ( Fig . 4G and H ) . In addition , F - actin accumulations were noted within the myoﬁbers ( Fig . 4C – F ) . Since myoﬁbrillar disruption and actin accumulations were seen together , we conclude that the actin accumulations were not ﬁber - type - speciﬁc . Abnor - mal mitochondrial accumulations were also noted ( Fig . 4I ) . a - Bungarotoxin and luxol blue staining of the quadriceps muscles were performed to evaluate the neuromuscular junctions and myelination of the nerve ﬁbers , respectively . There were no obvious differences in staining patterns between WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscles ( data not shown ) , sug - gesting that muscle weakness in these mice is not secondary to neuromuscular junction or nerve myelination defects . F - actin accumulations in coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mouse muscles Destrin and the coﬁlins play essential roles in regulating actin dynamics by severing actin ﬁlaments and promoting dissociation of actin monomers from pointed ends ( 21 ) . Compared with the other two isoforms , coﬁlin - 2 has a rela - tively weaker actin depolymerization activity and it also promotes ﬁlament assembly ( 5 ) . Since EM of coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient muscles had revealed the presence of F - actin accu - mulations in various muscle groups including the quadri - ceps and triceps , we further evaluated the F - actin accumulations utilizing phalloidin staining of frozen sec - tions to speciﬁcally label F - actin as well as an antibody that reacts with both F - actin and monomeric G - actin . Both stains reacted similarly , conﬁrming the presence of F - actin accumulations in the coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice ( Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and Coﬁ : Coﬁ / Ckmm + ) ( Fig . 5 ) . To determine whether coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency is associated with alterations in Acta1 expression and / or a - sarcomeric actin levels , we examined muscles from constitutive Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and Coﬁ : Coﬁ / Ckmm + mice and their littermate controls . Acta1 - mRNA levels were compared in samples taken from the quadriceps , triceps , gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles of WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . There was a small but statistically signiﬁcant Figure 4 . Transmission EM of coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient skeletal muscles . Samples were obtained from WT ( quad , A and B ) , Cﬂ2 2 / 2 ( triceps , C and D ) , Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Acta1 + ( quad , E and F ) , Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Mef2c + ( quad , G and H ) and Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + ( triceps , I and J ) mice .

Sarcomeric disruptions included intact sarcomeres alongside disrupted ones within a ﬁber ( C ) or an intact ﬁber alongside a disrupted ﬁber ( E ) . Actin accumulations shown by arrows ( C , D , G and H ) and nemaline bodies shown by arrowheads ( D , F , I and J ) were present within disrupted ﬁbers . Disintegrating Z - lines were noted , shown by ‘z’ ( G and H ) ( scale bar ¼ 500 nm ) . 2346 Human Molecular Genetics , 2012 , Vol . 21 , No . 10 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 21 / 10 / 2341 / 2900775 b y gue s t on 30 N o v e m be r 2018 increase in levels of Acta1 transcripts in triceps from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( n ¼ 4 ) but not in the quadriceps , gastrocne - mius and diaphragm , where the increasing trend was not statistically signiﬁcant ( Fig . 6E ) . In comparison , western blot analysis revealed a large increase in the amounts of actin present in the quadriceps and triceps of Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice muscles compared with WT ( Fig . 7A and B ) . Similar - ly , an increased amount of actin was present in the Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice ( Fig . 7C ) . Further , F - actin and mono - meric G - actin amounts were measured in the quadriceps muscles from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and WT littermates , and G - actin / F - actin ratios were calculated . While there was an increase in both G - actin and F - actin in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice compared with WT , there was a relatively higher increase in F - actin levels compared with G - actin ( Fig . 7D ) . Although coﬁlin - 2 has been shown to promote both polymerization and depolymerization of F - actin , these results are consistent with the primary function of coﬁlin - 2 in vivo being to sever and depolymerize F - actin . Proportion of slow ﬁbers and ﬁber - type - speciﬁc genes are altered in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice Slow or type I ﬁber predominance is frequently observed in human congenital myopathies including nemaline myopathy ( 22 – 24 ) . Slow ﬁber predominance has been identiﬁed in a mouse model with a - tropomyosin deﬁciency and NM pheno - type ( 25 ) . To investigate possible alterations in the ﬁber - type proportions , transverse sections of triceps muscle from four sets of 7 - day - old Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and WT littermate mice were assayed for myosin ATPase activity using pH - sensitive histo - chemical stain ( Fig . 6A ) . The mean percentage of slow ﬁbers in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice was signiﬁcantly higher than the WT ( 42 . 2 + 4 . 2 versus 14 . 4 + 1 . 1 % , P , 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 6B ) . To evaluate whether the increased proportion of slow ﬁbers corre - lated with changes in expression of various ﬁber - type - speciﬁc genes , we compared them in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and littermate - matched WT mice across various muscle groups ( quadriceps , triceps , gastrocnemius and diaphragm ) . Transcripts for genes expressed predominantly in fast ﬁbers ( Myh1 , Myh4 , Actn3 and Pvalb ) and slow ﬁbers ( Actn2 , Tnni1 and Mb ) were com - pared . The fast ﬁber - speciﬁc genes were signiﬁcantly downre - gulated in all the four muscle groups from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 6C ) ; in comparison , slow ﬁber - speciﬁc genes were signiﬁ - cantly upregulated in the coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient quadriceps and triceps muscles ( Fig . 6D ) . We evaluated the transcripts of other genes of interest in - cluding those encoding for thin ﬁlament proteins ( Acta1 , Neb and Tpm3 ) , Csrp3 and Actc ( Fig . 6E and F ) . Levels of transcripts for genes encoding thin ﬁlament proteins were not signiﬁcantly altered except upregulation of Acta1 in triceps . Further , Csrp3 was upregulated in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscle compared with the littermate WT . The protein encoded by CSRP3 is known to interact with coﬁlin - 2 , thereby regulating F - actin dynamics in the cardiac and skel - etal muscle , and it is upregulated in several myopathies ( 26 ) . In addition , Actc , encoding cardiac actin , was upregu - lated in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscle , indicative of ongoing regenera - tive activity ( 27 ) , a feature that has been noted in muscular dystrophies ( 28 ) .

Levels of a - sarcomeric actin , a - actinin - 2 and sarco - meric tropomyosin were elevated in the quadriceps and triceps muscles from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice while the amount of a - actinin - 3 was lower ( Fig . 7A and B ) . In addition , the cardiac muscle from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice exhibited an increase in a - sarcomeric actin , a - actinin - 2 and tropomyosin - 3 ( Fig . 7A and B ) . A marked reduction in coﬁlin - 2 in the skeletal muscles and heart was conﬁrmed in the Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice ( Fig . 7C ) . Anti - body cross - reacting with both a - actinin - 2 and a - actinin - 3 showed similar total protein amounts in the quadriceps from control and Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice ( Fig . 7C ) . This is consistent with a reduction in a - actinin - 3 and an increase in a - actinin - 2 seen in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . As a - actinin - 2 is mostly present in the slow ﬁbers and a - actinin - 3 in the fast ﬁbers ( 29 ) , an increase Figure 6 .

( A ) KO triceps had more darkly stained ﬁbers on microscopy . ( B ) Slow ﬁbers and total number of ﬁbers were counted for sections taken from the triceps ( n ¼ 4 ) . The percentage of slow ﬁbers in the WT and KO triceps was calculated , and the mean difference was found to be statistically signiﬁcant ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Expression of fast ﬁber - speciﬁc genes ( C ) and slow ﬁber - speciﬁc genes ( D ) in various muscle groups from WT and KO mice ( n ¼ 4 ) was measured using qRT – PCR and analyzed . Expression of genes encoding thin ﬁlament proteins ( E ) and expression of Cﬂ1 , Csrp3 and Actc ( F ) were also compared . Relative expression was compared using mean fold change ( KO / WT ) + standard error , and P - values using t - test were calculated ( ∗ P , 0 . 05 ) . 2348 Human Molecular Genetics , 2012 , Vol . 21 , No . 10 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 21 / 10 / 2341 / 2900775 b y gue s t on 30 N o v e m be r 2018 in a - actinin - 2 and reduction in a - actinin - 3 is consistent with slow ﬁber predominance seen in muscles from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . Coﬁlin - 2 is required for muscle maintenance The role of coﬁlin - 2 in myoﬁbrillogenesis is unclear . Its expression in mouse embryos begins at E10 . 5 and by E13 in the somites and it is present in the myogenic regions of the forelimb buds and myotomes , areas where myogenin , a muscle - speciﬁc transcription factor than induces myogenesis , and troponin T , a muscle structural protein , are expressed at the same time ( 4 ) . To evaluate the possibility that Cﬂ2 expres - sion is required for myogenesis , sections of quadriceps muscles were prepared from P1 , P3 and P7 Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and WT littermate mice . Light microscopy of H & E - stained sections showed no obvious differences between WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscles at P1 ( Fig . 8A and B ) . On P3 , occasional degenerating ﬁbers were noted in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 8D ) , and by P7 , muscles from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice showed extensive and severe degenerative changes ( Fig . 8F ) . Thus , while coﬁlin - 2 was not essential for initial myoﬁbrillogenesis , its expression was critical for muscle maintenance soon after birth . To further conﬁrm that myoﬁbrils were indeed well formed in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice , EM was performed on sections from E18 WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 embryos . Sarcomeres from E18 Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice had a normal sarcomeric structure with wide myoﬁbrils , distinct A - bands and narrow , uniformly spaced Z - lines , very similar to the WT ( Fig . 8G and H ) , demonstrating normal myoﬁbrillogenesis . Expression of coﬁlin - 1 , destrin and coﬁlin - 2 isoforms is essentially unchanged in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice To determine whether the expression of other AC proteins ( coﬁlin - 1 and destrin ) is altered in response to coﬁlin - 2 deﬁ - ciency , their RNA transcripts and protein levels were com - pared between the WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice at P7 . Quantitative RT ( qRT ) – PCR was performed on the extracted RNA from various muscle groups ( quadriceps , triceps , gastrocnemius and diaphragm ) of WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( n ¼ 4 ) . Dstn Figure 7 . Western blot analysis of sarcomeric protein expression in skeletal muscles , the heart and other tissues from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice . ( A ) Immunoblot analysis of P7 KO ( Cﬂ2 2 / 2 ) and WT littermate in duplicate . Increased levels of a - sarcomeric actin , a - actinin - 2 and sarcomeric tropomyosin were present in the KO quadriceps , triceps and the heart . Decreased levels of a - actinin - 3 were present in the KO quadriceps and triceps ( absent in the heart ) . Coﬁlin - 2 was expressed in the brain , but a - sarcomeric actin , a - actinin - 2 , a - actinin - 3 and tropomyosin were absent . ( B ) Densitometric analysis using Quantity One soft - ware conﬁrmed the increase in sarcomeric proteins as described above . ( C ) Immunoblot analysis of tissues from 3 - week - old Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + ( Ckmm + ) and control ( CO ) littermate . Coﬁlin - 2 levels were markedly reduced in the quadriceps and heart but were similar in other tissues including the kidney , brain , lung , spleen and liver . Increased levels of a - sarcomeric actin in the quadriceps , heart and presence of actin in lungs were noted in the Ckmm + mice . ( D ) Assessment of G - actin and F - actin levels in the frozen muscle extracts of WT and KO mice ( in duplicate ) by separating the two fractions by centrifugation and probing blots using antibody against a - sarcomeric actin . Both G - actin and F - actin were increased in the KO , but an increase in F - actin was relatively higher .

To evaluate alterations , if any , at the protein level , western blotting of samples from the quadriceps and triceps was performed using speciﬁc anti - coﬁlin - 1 antibodies . Levels of coﬁlin - 1 appeared similar in WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscles on P1 , P3 and P7 ( Fig . 9O ) . The levels of phosphorylated coﬁlin - 1 were also noted essentially indistinguishable between WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscles on P1 , P3 and P7 ( Fig . 9O ) . These data suggest that levels of other AC family proteins remain essen - tially unchanged in mice in response to coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency . Timing of muscle weakness in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice coincides with coﬁlin - 1 depletion within myoﬁbers To further understand coﬁlin - 1 dynamics in the developing muscle , we performed immunoﬂuorescence on muscle samples from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 and littermate WT mice using coﬁlin - 1 - Figure 8 . Evolution of muscle degeneration in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( B , D , F and H ) and comparison with WT littermate ( A , C , E and G ) . On P1 , muscles from the WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice were very similar on H & E staining ( A and B ) . By P3 , occasional degenerating ﬁbers were noted ( arrow ) in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( D ) . On P7 , multiple degenerated ﬁbers ( arrows ) were present in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice muscles ( F ) ( scale bar ¼ 50 m m ) . EM on a section from E18 embryos showed normally developed myoﬁbrils in both WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( scale bar ¼ 500 nm ) . 2350 Human Molecular Genetics , 2012 , Vol . 21 , No . 10 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 21 / 10 / 2341 / 2900775 b y gue s t on 30 N o v e m be r 2018 speciﬁc antibody . On P1 , coﬁlin - 1 co - localized with actin ( A - band ) on longitudinal sections ( Fig . 9I – N ) and was highly expressed within the myoﬁbers on transverse sections in both WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 9A and B ) . On P3 , coﬁlin - 1 expres - sion was markedly reduced , and by P7 , very little if any coﬁlin - 1 was detectable within the myoﬁbers of WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice ( Fig . 9C – F ) . The timing of reduction in coﬁlin - 1 coincided with the onset of myoﬁbrillar degeneration and skeletal muscle weakness in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . Further , coﬁlin - 1 expression was evaluated in WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 cardiac muscles , as Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice do not reveal any evidence of degeneration on H & E stain - ing on P7 ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , coﬁlin - 1 was highly expressed within the myoﬁbers of cardiac muscles from WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice on P7 ( Fig . 9G and H ) . Based on these ﬁnd - ings , it is plausible that coﬁlin - 1 , if overexpressed , may compen - sate for coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency . DISCUSSION Coﬁlin - 2 , a member of the AC group of proteins that include coﬁlin - 1 and destrin , regulates actin dynamics by severing actin ﬁlaments and causing actin depolymerization ( 1 , 30 ) . Coﬁlin - 2 is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and its molecular function in myogenesis and / or muscle maintenance is unknown . We previously identiﬁed a homozygous p . A35T - CFL2 mutation in two sisters with con - genital myopathy from a consanguineous family who presented with a pathological diagnosis of nemaline myopathy with mini - cores ( 2 ) . Since then , a second consanguineous family with con - genital myopathy and a novel homozygous missense CFL2 mutation has been identiﬁed ( C . Ockeloen , personal communi - cation ) . Our analysis of the various Cﬂ2 - conditional KO mouse strains revealed parallels to the human condition . Mice with constitutive excision of coﬁlin - 2 were born alive and noted to be very similar to WT littermates , but by P3 , affected animals exhibited dramatic reductions in size and activity and subse - quently worsened rapidly progressing to death by P8 . Affected pups did not move much and their stomachs were empty , con - sistent with their inability to suckle . Similar phenotypes were noted with Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Mef2c + ( skeletal muscle - speciﬁc coﬁlin - 2 - KO ) and Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Acta1 + ( embryonic somites and cardiac - speciﬁc coﬁlin - 2 - KO ) . Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm + mice ( skeletal and cardiac muscle - speciﬁc ) survived a little longer ( 10 – 31 days ) due to delayed onset of cre expression . Histo - pathological and EM analysis of the skeletal muscle from coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice revealed ballooning degeneration of several ﬁbers , core - like lesions , extensive sarcomeric Figure 9 . Coﬁlin - 1 expression in WT and KO ( Cﬂ2 2 / 2 ) mice . Immunoﬂuorescence analysis to evaluate coﬁlin - 1 expression in skeletal muscle samples obtained from WT and KO mice on P1 ( A and B ) , P3 ( C and D ) and P7 ( E and F ) , and cardiac muscle samples on P7 ( G and H ) using anti - coﬁlin - 1 - speciﬁc antibody . In skeletal muscles , progressive reduction in coﬁlin - 1 expression was noted with age ( A , C and E for WT and B , D and F for KO ) , and on P7 , coﬁlin - 1 was absent from within myoﬁbers in WT ( E ) and KO mice ( F ) . In the cardiac muscle , coﬁlin - 1 remained present within the myoﬁbers ( G and H ) on P7 ( scale bar ¼ 50 m m ) . Evaluation of coﬁlin - 1 localization using anti - coﬁlin - 1 ( I and J ) - and anti - a - sarcomeric actin ( K and L ) - speciﬁc antibodies , along with merged images ( M and N ) , in skeletal muscles from WT and KO mice on P1 . Coﬁlin - 1 was present in a striated pattern , and co - localized with a - sarcomeric actin in both WT ( I , K and M ) and KO ( J , L and N ) mice . ( O ) Western blot analysis of coﬁlin - 1 and phosphocoﬁlin - 1 levels in the WT and KO quadriceps , triceps and heart on P1 , P3 and P7 . The amounts of coﬁlin - 1 and phosphocoﬁlin - 1 were similar between the WT and KO quadriceps , triceps and heart on P1 , P3 and P7 .

Skeletal muscle weakness with nemaline bodies , core - like lesions and actin accumulations were also present in the human patient with p . A35T - CFL2 mutation , the mutation postulated to cause coﬁlin - 2 misfolding and consequent reduction in its levels . The degree of weakness in the murine KOs is clearly greater , as the affected girls were ambulant until adolescence , suggesting some partial or residual activity of the mutated coﬁlin - 2 in the human patients . Nevertheless , we conclude that coﬁlin - 2 is critical for muscle function soon after birth , and its deﬁciency is associated with a unique myopathy in mice similar to that seen in humans with CFL2 mutations . Coﬁlin - 2 expression in mice starts at E10 . 5 on the medial side of somites ( myotomal myogenic region ) , and by E13 , it is present in the limb buds ( along with myogenin , a muscle - speciﬁc transcription factor , and troponin T , a structural protein ) ( 4 , 31 ) . This suggests that coﬁlin - 2 may be critical in muscle development . Interestingly , Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice had well - formed myoﬁbrils at E18 and normal myoﬁbers on P1 , indicat - ing that coﬁlin - 2 was not critical for myoﬁbrillogenesis . Given its complementary pattern of expression and sarcomeric subcel - lular localization , we feel it is likely that coﬁlin - 1 serves as a fetal skeletal muscle isoform , compensating for coﬁlin - 2 deﬁ - ciency during initial myoﬁbrillogenesis in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . To evaluate expression of other AC proteins in response to coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency , we compared expression of Cﬂ1 and Dstn in muscle samples from WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice using qRT – PCR and western blot . On qRT – PCR analysis , Cﬂ1 transcripts were present , while Dstn transcripts were undetectable in both WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . Further , Cﬂ1 expression was very similar in the WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice across several muscle groups . Western blot analysis to evaluate levels of coﬁlin - 1 in several muscle groups revealed similar levels of coﬁlin - 1 in WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice on P1 , P3 and P7 . Thus , we found no evidence that coﬁlin - 1 expression was increased in response to coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency . However , it was interesting to note that residual coﬁlin - 1 remained present in muscle samples from Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice when they died on P7 . Previously , it has been postulated that coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency effects may appear only in the adult skeletal muscle to coincide with the timing when mice skeletal muscles lack coﬁlin - 1 ( by 2 months of age ) ( 4 ) . To evaluate whether there was an alter - ation in coﬁlin - 1 localization in muscles during the ﬁrst 7 days after birth , immunoﬂuorescence using coﬁlin - 1 - speciﬁc antibody was performed on WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 muscles , sampled on P1 , P3 and P7 after birth . On P1 , coﬁlin - 1 was highly expressed , localized to the A - band of the myoﬁbers , but by P7 , coﬁlin - 1 expression within the myoﬁbers was absent ( reduced on P3 ) , and instead , it localized mainly to the connective tissue and blood vessels ( data not shown ) . No differences in the coﬁlin - 1 expression patterns were noted between the WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . Thus , lack of coﬁlin - 1 and coﬁlin - 2 within the skeletal myoﬁbers of Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice may explain the rapid deterioration in muscle structure and function soon after birth . Interestingly , high expression of coﬁlin - 1 within cardiac myoﬁbers from 7 - day - old WT and Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice heart samples correlated well with the lack of cardiac muscle degeneration in the Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . Overall , coﬁlin - 1 may be able to compensate for coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency if it is expressed within the myoﬁbers . Breeding coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice with lines overexpressing coﬁlin - 1 in the skel - etal muscle may help understand this issue further . Increased proportions of slow myoﬁbers have been described with various human myopathies and in a mouse model of NM with M9R - Tpm3 - knockin mutation and , in many instances , are probably a non - speciﬁc response to myo - pathic conditions ( 20 , 32 ) . Similarly , we identiﬁed an increased proportion of slow ﬁbers ( type I / type IIa ) in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mouse skeletal muscles on ATPase staining . In addition , transcripts for several genes that are primarily expressed in fast ﬁbers ( type IIx / IIb ) were signiﬁcantly reduced in abundance , and transcript levels for slow ﬁber - speciﬁc genes were elevated in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice compared with WT littermates . Additionally , western blotting revealed increased levels of a - actinin - 2 protein ( slow ﬁber - speciﬁc ) and reduced amounts of a - actinin - 3 ( fast ﬁber - speciﬁc ) in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice . Thus , a sig - niﬁcant increase in the proportion of slow ﬁbers in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 mice is consistent with other human and murine myopathies . The molecular mechanisms responsible for myopathy - related alterations in the ﬁber type are yet to be understood . The presence of F - actin accumulations in coﬁlin - 2 - KO mice seen by EM , immunoﬂuorescence and western blot experi - ments can be explained by reduced or abnormal actin depoly - merization activity due to coﬁlin - 2 deﬁciency . Similar F - actin accumulations in muscles have been noted with certain ACTA1 mutations that alter actin polymerization contributing to insoluble actin ﬁlaments ( 33 ) . F - actin accumulations in corneal epithelial cells have been described in mice deﬁcient in destrin , a member of the AC group of proteins ( 15 ) . Z - line disintegration and marked sarcomeric disruption was a critical ﬁnding in these coﬁlin - 2 - deﬁcient mice . The underlying mechanism is unclear , although we suspect that extensive sar - comeric disruption may be preceded by Z - line disintegration . Z - lines are formed from the interdigitating barbed ends of the antiparallel actin ﬁlaments from adjoining sarcomeres cross - linked by a - actinin . Recently , cross - linking of actin ﬁlaments by a - actinin was noted to be increased by coﬁlin - 1 in in vitro experiments ( 34 ) . It was hypothesized that this action was due to coﬁlin’s ability to alter the actin ﬁlament twist . It is plausible that coﬁlin - 2 may play a stabilizing role in the muscle Z - line by strengthening the actin – actinin cross - link , and its deﬁciency may weaken and consequently disrupt sarco - meres starting at the Z - line during muscle contraction . Myoﬁ - brillar myopathy ( MFM ) , a muscle disorder associated with similar Z - line disruption , myoﬁbrillar degeneration and accu - mulation of abnormal proteins , is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in maintaining the struc - tural integrity of the Z - line including desmin , a B - crystallin , myotilin and LIM domain binding 3 ( 35 ) . While a majority of MFM cases are autosomal dominant and adult - onset , CFL2 may be a candidate gene for atypical MFM patients with an autosomal recessive inheritance and early - onset disease .

An (cid:4) 10 . 4 kb region used to construct the targeting vector was ﬁrst sub - cloned from a positively identiﬁed C57BL / 6 BAC clone ( RP23 - 422H22 ) using a homologous recombination - based technique . The BAC was subcloned into an (cid:4) 2 . 4 kb pSP72 ( Promega ) backbone vector containing an ampicillin selection cassette . A pGK - gb2 loxP / FRT - ﬂanked Neo cassette was inserted into the gene . The region was designed such that the short homologous arm ( SA ) extends 2 . 0 kb to the 3 ′ end of loxP / FRT - ﬂanked Neo cassette . The long homologous arm ( LA ) extends 6 . 3 kb to the 5 ′ end of the single loxP1 site ( Fig . 1A ) . This single loxP1 site is inserted upstream of exon 2 , and the loxP / FRT - ﬂanked Neo cassette is inserted downstream of exon 4 . The target region is (cid:4) 2 . 1 kb contain - ing exons 2 , 3 and 4 . The targeting vector is conﬁrmed by restriction analysis after each modiﬁcation step and by sequen - cing using primers designed to read from the Neo selection cassette into the 3 ′ end of the LA and the 5 ′ end of the SA . The loxP1 site was conﬁrmed by sequencing . Ten micrograms of the targeting vector were linearized by Cla I and then trans - fected by electroporation of IC1 C57BL / 6 ES cells . After selection with G418 antibiotic , surviving clones were expanded for PCR analysis to identify recombinant ES clones . Secondary conﬁrmation of positive clones identiﬁed by PCR was performed by Southern blotting analysis . In brief , DNA was digested with Eco RI and electrophoretically separated on a 0 . 8 % agarose gel . After transfer to a nylon membrane , the digested DNA was hybridized with a probe tar - geted against the 3 ′ external region . DNA from C57Bl / 6 ( B6 ) mouse strains was used as WT controls . The expected sizes were 8 . 6 kb for WT and 5 . 1 kb for conditional Cﬂ2 - KO allele ( Coﬁ ) ( Fig . 1B ) . The PB1 / 2 probe primers were PB1 : AAC GCA GGG AAA TTC TAA CCC and PB2 : ACA GGG AAA CAG CTC TAC TAT C . The targeted IC1 C57BL / 6 ES cells were microinjected into Balb / c blastocysts . Resulting chimeras with a high - percentage black coat color were mated to WT C57BL / 6 mice to generate heterozygous offspring . Tail DNA was analyzed for mice het - erozygous for conditional Cﬂ2 - KO allele ( Coﬁ / + ) using the forward primer ( SDL1 ) : GGT TGG AGT TTA CAC TTG ATT CTC TT and reverse primer ( SDL2 ) : CAA CGT AAG CAG TCC TAT TAG GTC to include loxP1 site present in the conditionally KO allele . With the addition of the loxP site , the ampliﬁed conditionally KO allele was 426 bp while the WT allele was 364 bp . The heterozygotes were bred to obtain the homozygous mice ( Coﬁ / Coﬁ ) as shown in Figure 1C . Routine genotyping was achieved on genomic DNA isolated from tail tips of mice as described for each stain below .

Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice were bred with homozygous C57BL / 6 - Tg ( Zp3 - cre ) 93Knw / J ( zp3 - cre / zp3 - cre ) mice to create Coﬁ / + : zp3 - cre / + mice . Female Coﬁ / + : zp3 - cre / + were crossed with WT male ( Cﬂ2 + / + ) to create heterozygous constitutive KO mice ( Cﬂ2 + / 2 ) who were then inbred to obtain homozygous constitutive KO ( Cﬂ2 2 / 2 ) mice . The Zp3 - cre - positive mice were screened using the following primers : WT _ F : CTA GGC CAC AGA ATT GAA AGA TCT , WT _ R : GTA GGT GGA AAT TCT AGC ATC ATC C , Cre _ F : GCG GTC TGG CAG TAA AAA CTA TC and Cre _ R : GTG AAA CAG CAT TGC TGT CAC TT . The size of WT allele is 324 bp and of Zp3 - cre allele is 100 bp . Coﬁlin - 2 excision was conﬁrmed using the following primers : SDL1 , SDL2 ( as described before ) and SDL5 _ R : TCC GGC TAA TAG CAG AGA GC . The WT allele PCR product size is 364 bp ( SDL1 and SDL2 ) and the KO allele size is 617 bp ( SDL1 and SDL5 _ R ) ( Fig . 1D ) . SDL2 is excised in the KO allele and the PCR product size for SDL1 – SDL5 _ R primers in WT allele is 2 . 6 kb . Sequencing of the PCR products conﬁrmed the excision of exons 2 – 4 and the Neo cassette . Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm - cre / + . Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice were bred with B6 . FVB ( 129S4 ) - Tg ( Ckmm - cre ) 5Khn / J hemizygous mice ( Ckmm - cre / + ) obtained from Jackson labs to create Coﬁ / + : - Ckmm - cre / + mice which were then bred with Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice to create Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Ckmm - cre / + mice . The primers used to genotype Ckmm - cre were : WT _ F : CAA ATG TTG CTT GTC TGG TG , WT _ R : GTC AGT CGA GTG CAC AGT TT , Cre _ F : TAA GTC TGA ACC CGG TCT GC and Cre _ R : GTG AAA CAG CAT TGC TGT CAC TT . The WT control size is 200 bp and the Ckmm - cre is 450 bp . Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Mef2c - cre / + . Hemizygous Mef2c - cre mice were resuscitated from cryopreserved material from MMRRC ( Item no . 030261 - UNC - RESUS ) . Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice were bred with them to create Coﬁ / + : Mef2c - cre / + mice that were then bred with Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice to create Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Mef2c - cre / + mice . The following genotyping primers were used : forward : TGC CAC GAC CAA GTG ACA GC and reverse : CCA GGT TAC GGA TAT AGT TCA TG . A 700 bp band is present in the Mef2c - cre transgenic mice . Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Acta1 - cre / + . Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice were bred with B6 . Cg - Tg ( Acta1 - cre ) 79Jme / J hemizygous mice ( Ckmm - cre / + ) obtained from Jackson labs to create Coﬁ / + : - Acta1 - cre / + mice which were then bred with Coﬁ / Coﬁ mice to create Coﬁ / Coﬁ : Acta1 - cre / + mice . The primers used to detect Acta1 - cre were the same as used for the Zp3 - cre allele . Tissue collection Mice were euthanized at various ages ( P1 , P3 , P7 and P28 ) using inhaled CO 2 followed by decapitation immediately prior to tissue collection as per the regulations of the institu - tional animal care and use committee at Children’s Hospital Boston . The quadriceps , gastrocnemius , triceps , soleus and diaphragm muscles were removed in addition to other tissues including the heart , lung , liver , kidneys , brain and spleen . Euthanized mice were also sent for complete autopsy performed at the Rodent Histopathology Core , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA . In addition , embryos Human Molecular Genetics , 2012 , Vol . 21 , No . 10 2353 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 21 / 10 / 2341 / 2900775 b y gue s t on 30 N o v e m be r 2018 18 - day post - coitus ( E18 ) were dissected and muscle tissue har - vested for EM . Histological analysis Eight - micrometer cross - sections of isopentane - frozen tissue were obtained and stained with H & E for evaluation using an Eclipse 50i microscope ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Melville , NY , USA ) . Light microscopic images were captured using a SPOT Insight 4 Meg FW Color Mosaic camera and SPOT 4 . 5 . 9 . 1 software ( Diagnostic Instruments Inc . , Sterling Heights , MI , USA ) . H & E , NADH and ATPase stainings were performed using standard protocols . Electron microscopy Skeletal muscle samples ( 1 – 2 mm cubes ) were ﬁxed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 1 . 25 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 03 % picric acid in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) overnight in room temperature . They were then washed in 0 . 1 M cacody - late buffer and post - ﬁxed with 1 % osmium tetroxide ( OsO 4 ) / 1 . 5 % potassium ferrocyanide ( KFeCN6 ) for 1 h , washed in water 3 × and incubated in 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h followed by two washes in water and subsequent dehydra - tion in grades of alcohol ( 10 min each ; 50 , 70 , 90 % , 2 × 10 min 100 % ) . The samples were then put in propylene oxide for 1 h and inﬁltrated ON in a 1 : 1 mixture of propylene oxide and TAAB Epon ( Marivac Canada Inc . , St Laurent , Canada ) . The following day , the samples were embedded in TAAB Epon and polymerized at 60 8 C for 48 h . Ultrathin sec - tions ( (cid:4) 60 nm ) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut - S microtome , picked up on to copper grids stained with lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1200EX Transmission electron micro - scope or a TecnaiG 2 Spirit BioTWIN , and images were recorded with an AMT 2k CCD camera . This was performed at the EM Core of the Harvard Medical School . RT – PCR analysis RNA was extracted from various muscle groups using RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) . Extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript III First - Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY , USA ) . Speciﬁc primers for Cﬂ2 exons 2 – 4 ( forward : CAT TGG TGA CAC TGT AGA G ; reverse : CAT TTA CTT GCC ACT CAT GT ) were used . For qRT – PCR analysis , 100 ng of the cDNA was added to 10 m l of the Taqman Uni - versal PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and 1 m l of the appropriate Taqman probe ( Applied Bio - systems ) to create the qRT – PCR samples . VIC - labeled Glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was used as the control probe and primers for genes of interest had a FAM probe . qRT – PCR was performed and analyzed using the 7300 Real Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) and 7500 Real - Time PCR System Sequence Detection Soft - ware v1 . 4 . The PCR program used was 50 8 C for 2 min , 95 8 C for 10 min and 40 repetitions of 95 8 C for 0 . 15 min and 60 8 C for 1 min . The relative amount of target gene expression in Cﬂ2 2 / 2 animals was calculated as fold changes relative to WT littermate controls that were normalized to GAPDH . Immunoﬂuorescence For immunoﬂuorescence studies , 8 m m frozen transverse sec - tions of the quadriceps muscle were double stained with rabbit a - actinin - 2 ( 36 ) ( 3A or 3B at 1 : 200 ) and either mouse anti - a - sarcomeric actin ( 5C5 , 1 : 200 dilution , Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) or AlexaFluor - conjugated phalloidin 546 ( 1 : 40 , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . For phal - loidin staining , tissue sections were ﬁxed with 4 % formalde - hyde solution , and for others , methanol was used . In addition , 1 - , 3 - and 7 - day - old skeletal muscle and 7 - day - old heart sections were stained with anti - coﬁlin - 1 antibody ( D3F9 , 1 : 40 dilution , Cell Signaling , Beverly , MA , USA ) . Secondary antibodies included AlexaFluor - conjugated anti - rabbit and anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 100 ; Molecular Probes ) . Cover slips were mounted using Vectashield Mounting Medium with or without DAPI ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) . Staining was evaluated using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope using NIS - Elements AR software ( Nikon Instruments Inc . ) . Western blots Tissues from various muscles and organs were frozen at nec - ropsy and stored at 2 80 8 C until analysis . Protein isolation and western blot procedures were performed as described previ - ously ( 37 ) . Transferred proteins were probed with antibodies against coﬁlin - 2 ( C7506 - 50C , 1 : 250 dilution ; US Biological , Swampscott , MA , USA ) , coﬁlin - 1 ( D3F9 , 1 : 250 dilution , Cell Signaling ) , phosphorylated coﬁlin - 1 ( H - 2 , 1 : 250 dilution , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , a - sarcomeric actin ( 5C5 , 1 : 1000 dilution , Sigma ) , sarcomeric tropomyosin ( CH1 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) , a - actinin - 2 ( 3A or 3B ) ( 36 ) , a - actinin - 3 ( 4A or 4B ) ( 36 ) , sar - comeric a - actinin ( reacts with both a - actinin - 2 and a - actinin - 3 ) ( Sigma A5044 ) and GAPDH ( 6C5 , 1 : 10 , 000 dilu - tion ; Abcam PLC ) and visualized using enhanced chemilumin - escence . Adequacy of transfer was determined using Ponceau S staining . Quantiﬁcation of protein levels normalized to GAPDH was performed using the program Quantity One , version 4 . 2 . 1 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc . , Hercules , CA , USA ) on an Image Station 440 ( Kodak DS ; Eastman Kodak Co . , Rochester , NY , USA ) . G - actin / F - actin assay was per - formed using kit from Cytoskeleton ( Cat . # BK037 , Denver , CO , USA ) .
