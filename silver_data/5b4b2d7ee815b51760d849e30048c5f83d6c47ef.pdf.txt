Microtubules and microﬁlaments are relatively stiff polar structures whose assembly is modulated by the state of hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide . In contrast , intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) are more ﬂexible apolar structures assembled from a , 45 nm long coiled - coil dimer as the elementary building block . The differences in ﬂexibility that exist among the three ﬁlament systems have been described qualitatively by comparing electron micrographs of nega - tively stained dehydrated ﬁlaments and by directly measuring the per - sistence length of F - actin ﬁlaments ( , 3 – 10 m m ) and microtubules ( , 1 – 8 mm ) by various physical methods . However , quantitative data on the persistence length of IFs are still missing . Toward this goal , we have carried out atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in physiological buffer to characterise the morphology of individual vimentin IFs adsorbed to different solid supports . In addition , we compared these images with those obtained by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) of negatively stained dehydrated ﬁlaments . For each support , we could accurately measure the apparent persistence length of the ﬁlaments , yielding values ranging between 0 . 3 m m and 1 m m . Making simple assumptions concerning the adsorption mechanism , we could estimate the persistence length of an IF in a dilute solution to be , 1 m m , indicating that the lower measured values reﬂect constraints induced by the adsorption process of the ﬁlaments on the corresponding support . Based on our knowledge of the structural organisation and mechanical properties of IFs , we reason that the lower persistence length of IFs compared to that of F - actin ﬁlaments is caused by the presence of ﬂexible linker regions within the coiled - coil dimer and by postulating the occur - rence of axial slipping between dimers within IFs . q 2003 Elsevier Ltd .

The physical properties of actin ﬁlaments and microtubules have been already well characterised at the single ﬁlament 1 , 2 and network levels . 3 , 4 In contrast , such knowledge is still sparse for intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) and is urgently needed to understand how disease - causing inherited mutations in human IF proteins lead to impaired IF assembly and yield an increase in cell fragility in response to mechanical stress . 5 – 7 All IF proteins exhibit a characteristic “tripartite” structure which includes an a - helical “rod” 0022 - 2836 / $ - see front matter q 2003 Elsevier Ltd .

( 2004 ) 335 , 1241 – 1250 domain ﬂanked by non - a - helical “head” and “tail” domains . The central rod domain contains a pronounced heptad repeat sequence of apolar residues exhibiting the signature of a coiled - coil structure . This periodicity is interrupted by three relatively short variable linkers L1 , L12 and L2 , leading to four independent a - helical coiled - coil segments , 1A , 1B , 2A and 2B . 8 The elementary building block of all IF proteins is a dimer that can , under appropriate buffer conditions , 9 self - assemble in vitro into 10 nm wide ﬁlaments . For cytoplasmic IFs , an intermediary stable complex is a tetramer comprising two dimers that are arranged in an antiparallel approximately half - staggered fashion relative to one another . In the case of vertebrate cytoplasmic IFs , the in vitro assembly process follows three distinct steps . First , the tetramers associate laterally into so - called “unit - length” ﬁlaments ( ULFs ) . Second , the ULFs anneal longitudinally into ﬁlaments of variable width . Third , these ﬁlaments compact radially to form smooth - looking IFs 8 – 12 nm in diameter ( Figure 1 ) . 10 The mechanical properties of IF networks in vitro have mainly been studied by rheological and light scattering methods . 3 , 11 , 12 From these studies it was concluded that indi - vidual IFs are relatively ﬂexible polymers and that IF networks exhibit “strain hardening” with a high resistance against rupture . In order to obtain a more quantitative estimate of IF ﬂexibility , human recombinant vimentin was assembled in vitro and the resulting IFs were adsorbed to various solid supports including mica , glass and HOPG ( highly oriented pyrolitic graphite ) . Thus , immobilised ﬁlaments were imaged under physiological conditions by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , and their contours were analysed using a statistical polymer chain approach . 13 , 14 Depending on the support used , the apparent persistence length l app of the vimentin IFs varied from 0 . 3 m m to 1 m m . The lower value was obtained with mica that interacts strongly with the ﬁlaments thereby yielding more compact structures , whereas the upper value was measured on glass that allows the ﬁlaments to adopt a con - tour that is energetically equilibrated to a higher extent in two dimensions . Theory The persistence length l of a ﬁlament is a measure of its ﬂexibility and represents a statistical relationship between the contour length s and the end - to - end distance R of a given ﬁlament segment . Let us consider a ﬁlament of contour length s ; which is smoothly bent by an angle Q and ener - getically equilibrated in two dimensions . The energy necessary to maintain this conﬁguration is given by : 15 E ¼ YI Q 2 = 2 s ð 1 Þ where Y is the Young’s modulus , and I the area moment of inertia of the ﬁlament . The persistence length l of the ﬁlament can be directly related to these two quantities by : 16 YI ¼ k B T l ð 2 Þ where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature . Using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the normalised probability distribution function in two dimen - sions for a ﬁlament bent by an angle Q is Gaussian and can be written as : P ð Q ð s ÞÞ 2D ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ l 2 p s r e 2 lQ 2 = 2 s ð 3 Þ Note that this distribution function depends on the contour length s of the ﬁlament . In equation ( 3 ) , the persistence length l appears as the charac - teristic length of the distribution . Hence for l q s , the probability of bending the ﬁlament is equal to 0 ( see also equation ( 4 ) ) . From this distribution , it is possible to compute the mean - square angle and the normalised mean - fourth power of the angle : k Q 2 ð s Þ l 2D ¼ s l ð 4 Þ k Q 4 ð s Þ l 2D k Q 2 ð s Þ l 22D ¼ 3 ð 5 Þ Using equation ( 3 ) the mean - square end - to - end distance of a ﬁlament of contour length s can also be determined as : 17 k R 2 ð s Þ l 2D ¼ 4 l s 1 2 2 l s 1 2 e 2 s = 2 l (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) ð 6 Þ Figure 1 .

In that case and for contour lengths of the ﬁlaments in the range of l the value obtained is identical to the persistence length of the same ﬁlament in a dilute solution . For contour lengths much larger than l excluded volume effects may apparently stiffen the ﬁlaments . If the ﬁlament is not equilibrated , the above model only yields an apparent persistence length , which , in turn , depends on the surface adsorption mechanism . Results Contour morphologies of vimentin IFs adsorbed to different solid supports A typical electron micrograph of negatively stained glutaraldehyde - ﬁxed , vimentin ﬁlaments exhibits smooth - looking structures approximately 10 nm in diameter ( Figure 1 ) . For comparison , Figure 2 displays tapping - mode AFM images in air ( Figure 2a ) or in physiological buffer ( Figure 2b ) of vimentin IFs adsorbed to mica , to HOPG ( Figure 2c ) and to hydrophilic glass ( Figure 2d ) . On all these supports , the ﬁlaments appear to be stably attached without the need of any chemical cross - linking . Filaments on mica imaged in air show two different mor - phologies ( Figure 2a ) characterised by a height of 0 . 8 nm and 1 . 7 nm , respectively , and a full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of 100 nm and 45 nm , respectively . The ﬁrst type may correspond to ﬁla - ments that have been spread ﬂattened into protoﬁ - laments , whereas the second type may correspond to smooth - looking dried ﬁlaments . Notice that in our AFM images no individual protoﬁlamentous substructures could be depicted , contrary to pre - viously described electron micrographs of unra - velled ﬁlaments . 18 In contrast , when imaged in buffer , the ﬁlaments adsorbed to the three different supports appear compact and smooth with a height of 3 – 5 nm and an apparent diameter of 40 – 70 nm . For compari - son , neuroﬁlaments exhibit a height of 9 . 5 nm and a FWHM of 50 nm when covalently bound to a modiﬁed glass substrate and imaged by contact mode AFM in buffer . 19 However , even if the ﬁla - ments have a similar height and apparent diameter on the three different supports , they yield very different contours . On mica ( Figure 2b ) , for example , the ﬁlaments often show loops in com - parison to a more extended appearance of the ﬁla - ments when adsorbed to HOPG ( Figure 2c ) , hydrophilic glass ( Figure 2d ) , or to carbon - coated copper grids ( Figure 1 ) . Such differences in contour are a ﬁrst hint that the vimentin IFs exhibit some - what different ﬂexibilities when adsorbed to either mica or to the other three supports . Statistical analysis of IF contours with a 2D equilibration model In order to quantify the apparent ﬂexibility of vimentin IFs after adsorption to the different sup - ports , we used the AFM images to measure the mean - square end - to - end distance k R 2 l app of entire ﬁlaments with contour lengths ranging from 2000 nm to 4000 nm ( see Table 1 ) . For each ﬁlament set , a mean contour length k s l was also computed and used in equation ( 6 ) to estimate an apparent persistence length l 2 k R l ( Table 1 ) . As expected from the contour differences observed on the AFM and EM images , the vimentin IFs adsorbed to mica have a lower apparent persistence length ( 337 nm ) than the same ﬁlaments adsorbed to HOPG ( 675 nm ) , carbon - coated cooper grids ( 967 nm ) , or hydrophilic glass ( 1061 nm ) . In order to conﬁrm these results and to verify the validity of our statistical model , the angle distri - bution function Q was estimated as a function of the measured contour length s . For this purpose , the ﬁlament contours were divided into sets of segments of ﬁxed contour length s . For each sup - port and a ﬁxed contour length s of 1000 nm , an example of a Q distribution function is displayed in Figure 3a . In each case the distributions could be ﬁtted with similar Gaussian functions , except for mica where the distribution was signiﬁcantly broader . As stressed when introducing equation ( 3 ) , the statistical analysis that we have chosen is only valid if the Q distribution function is Gaussian . This property was checked by plotting the normalised mean - fourth power of the angle distribution k Q 4 l = k Q 2 l 2 as a function of the contour Figure 2 .

For contour lengths shorter than 600 nm , some deviation from the theoretical value of 3 ( see equation ( 5 ) ) is observed due to the ﬁnite pixel size and the smoothing procedure . Above 600 nm , it was possible to estimate the apparent persistence length l k Q 2 l for each support by ﬁtting the behaviour of the mean - square angle k Q 2 l as a function of contour length ( Figure 3c ) with equation ( 4 ) . The measured apparent per - sistence lengths l k Q 2 l ( see Table 1 ) are 284 nm ( mica ) , 769 nm ( HOPG ) , 847 nm ( carbon - coated copper grid ) , and 980 nm ( glass ) , respectively . These values are consistent with the corresponding l 2 k R l values ( see Table 1 and above ) . However , it is interesting to note that the linear ﬁts shown in Figure 3c were accurate for the glass and the EM data sets but rather poor for the mica data set and at high contour lengths for the HOPG data set . This clearly indicates that for the ﬁrst two data sets , the vimentin IFs can effectively be mod - elled as smoothly bent strings equilibrated in two dimensions . In other words , the inﬂuence of the glass and the carbon - coated copper grid on the vimentin IF ﬂexibility is negligible and conse - quently the apparent persistence length obtained for these two supports , , 1000 nm , should be simi - lar to the persistence length of an unconstrained single vimentin IF in a dilute solution . 17 , 20 In contrast , the ﬁlaments adsorbed to mica and HOPG appear more ﬂexible , as indicated by their lower apparent persistence length . For these two supports , a modiﬁed version of our statistical model has to be used to analyse the data , i . e . one that takes into account some kind of ﬁlament - support interaction . The contours of the IFs adsorbed to mica can be described by a quasi - normal projection model Since it is difﬁcult to know the type of inter - action that drives the adsorption of vimentin IFs to mica or HOPG , we have decided to use a practi - cal ﬁrst approximation : if the ﬁlament - support interaction is strong enough , a vimentin ﬁlament may adsorb to the support as an apparent normal projection of the three - dimensional ﬁlament con - tour onto the plane . Note that the term projection is geometrically incorrect here , since the actual contour length of the ﬁlament is conserved upon adsorption . However , by such an approximation the mean - square of the projected end - to - end dis - tance becomes : 17 k R 2 l proj : ¼ k R 2 x l þ k R 2 y l ¼ 2 3 k R 2 l 3D ð 7 Þ For s ! 1 : k R 2 l proj : ¼ 1 3 k R 2 l 2D ð 8 Þ where k R 2 l 3D is the mean - square end - to - end distance of the ﬁlament equilibrated in a dilute solution , and k R 2 l 2D is the mean - square end - to - end distance of the ﬁlament equilibrated on a solid support ( see equation ( 6 ) ) . k R 2 l 3D and the per - sistence length l of the ﬁlament equilibrated in a dilute solution is given by : 14 k R 2 ð s Þ l 3D ¼ 2 l s 1 2 l s 1 2 e 2 s = l (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) ð 9 Þ To test the validity of the above model , the experi - mental mean - square end - to - end distance of ﬁla - ments , with contour lengths ranging between 2000 nm and 4000 nm , was calculated as a function of their contour length s : The corresponding plots are shown in Figure 3d for each support . For s longer than 600 nm , the k R 2 l of the ﬁlaments adsorbed to mica is smaller and deviates strongly from the k R 2 l of the ﬁlaments adsorbed to the three other supports . If we assume that the mean - square end - to - end distances measured for the ﬁlaments adsorbed to glass or EM grids are a good approximation of k R 2 l 2D ; the ﬁlaments adsorbed to mica are most likely to follow equation ( 8 ) . As the extrapolation to an inﬁnite contour length of our experimental data is not very reliable , we decided to use another test of the quasi - normal projection model . According to equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , it should be possible to estimate the “true” persistence length of the vimentin IFs equilibrated in a dilute solution from the experimental mean - square end - to - end dis - tance of the ﬁlaments adsorbed to mica . The value obtained for l should be similar to that obtained from the glass data set ( i . e . , 1000 nm ) , assuming that the ﬁlaments are energetically equilibrated on this support ( 2D equilibration hypothesis ) . For this purpose , we determined the persistence length as a function of contour length using the experimental mean - square end - to - end distances of the ﬁlaments adsorbed to glass and to mica ( Figure 4 ) . For this test , the ﬁlaments analysed had contour lengths in the range of 3000 nm to 5500 nm . When the 2D equilibration hypothesis ( equation ( 6 ) ) is used for the mica and glass data sets ( Figure 4 , diamonds ) , both curves show an increase of l at low contour length due to the ﬁnite pixel size and the smoothing procedure . At high contour length , l is constant and the values obtained for the two data sets are similar to those obtained previously and listed in Table 2 , 358 nm for mica and 1107 nm for hydrophilic glass . When the quasi - normal projection hypothesis ( equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) ) is used for the mica data set ( Figure 4 , squares ) , l 3D is equal to 1275 nm at high contour length ( see Table 2 ) , which is only 15 % higher than the value l 2D obtained for the glass data set using the 2D equilibration model ( 1107 nm ) . However , for ﬁlaments with contour lengths below 2500 nm , l is increasing steadily , indicating that the adsorbed ﬁlaments cannot be considered as quasi - normal projections any more . In conclusion , for ﬁlaments longer than 2500 nm adsorbed to mica , it is possible to calculate with Vimentin Filament Flexibility 1245 the quasi - normal projection model a persistence length similar to that obtained by analysing the ﬁlaments adsorbed to glass or to EM grids with the 2D equilibration model . Both calculations are conﬁrming that the persistence length of vimentin IFs in a dilute solution is in the range of 1000 nm to 1300 nm . Hence , for such a persistence length , the contour lengths of the adsorbed ﬁlaments were always too short to observe any kind of excluded volume effects . 17 For the long ﬁlaments ( above 1400 nm long ; Figure 3c ) adsorbed to HOPG and short ﬁlaments ( below 2500 nm long ; Figure 4 ) adsorbed to mica , no simple model was able to quantitatively describe the observed beha - viours , indicating that the adsorption mechanism is more complex than assumed in these two cases . Discussion The apparent ﬂexibility of vimentin IFs depends on the type of support Vimentin IFs readily adsorb to a wide range of solid supports , with very different surface proper - ties , either being highly negatively charged ( mica ) , hydrophobic ( HOPG ) or polar ( hydrophilic glass ) . However , on each support the ﬁlaments exhibit different ﬂexibilities as emphasised by the broad range of measured apparent persistence lengths ( see Figure 2 and Table 1 ) . Similar effects are obtained by varying the adsorption buffer with a given support ( data not shown ) . Such kind of buffer - dependences of the apparent ﬂexibility has been extensively studied by AFM for DNA molecules adsorbed to mica 17 and is caused by different kinds of mica – DNA interaction . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time that a similar effect has been reported with protein ﬁlaments . Strikingly , although DNA and vimentin IFs are very different polymers , upon adsorption to a solid support their contours can be accurately described by the linear chain statistics model pre - sented in Theory . With both polymers , depending on the ﬁlament - support interaction employed , two principal adsorption scenarios are possible . 1 . For an interaction energy in the range of the thermal energy , the ﬁlaments will freely equilibrate on the support before they become adsorbed . In this case , the elastic properties are conserved during the adsorp - tion process , so that the measured persistence length is equal to that of a ﬁlament equili - brated in a dilute solution . 2 . For an interaction energy bigger than the thermal energy , the ﬁlaments will be “caught” by the support before having equili - brated so that the ﬁlaments are “ﬁxed” into a contour resembling a normal ( i . e . perpendicu - lar ) projection of the actual three - dimensional contour onto the support . Such a “capture” mechanism yields more condensed ﬁlaments on the support and hence a smaller apparent persistence length is revealed . Vimentin IFs equilibrate upon adsorption to glass or to a carbon ﬁlm ( i . e . a glow - discharged carbon - coated EM grid ) . In contrast , the same ﬁla - ments appear normally projected when adsorbed to mica . After proper modelling , both data sets yielded a similar estimate of the persistence length l , i . e . 1000 – 1300 nm . Strikingly , a similar estimate has been recently derived by Fudge et al . using the Figure 4 . Apparent persistence length as a function of contour length for hydrophilic glass ( black ) and mica ( green ) . The apparent persistence length was extracted in two different ways from the mean - square end - to - end distances computed from ﬁlaments of contour length in the range of 3000 nm to 5500 nm : diamonds , 2D equili - bration model ( equation ( 6 ) ) ; squares , quasi - normal pro - jection model ( equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) ) . For each curve , the continuous lines are the mean values of the persistence length extracted from the mean - square end - to - end dis - tance obtained by simply taking the entire contour length of the ﬁlaments . These values are summarised in Table 2 . Table 2 .

For mica only , the quasi - normal projection model was used to estimate k R 2 l 3D from k R 2 l app ( equation ( 7 ) ) . In turn , k R 2 l 3D was used in combi - nation with k s l in equation ( 9 ) to estimate l 3D : 1246 Vimentin Filament Flexibility initial tensile modulus of hagﬁsh slime threads containing mainly keratin - like IFs . 21 Concerning the high binding afﬁnity of IFs to different solid supports , it is well known that the nuclear lamins interact with the nuclear surface of the nuclear envelope . 22 Similarly , vimentin does associate in vivo with the plasma membrane . 23 The lipids composing the plasma membrane have generally polar head groups that may interact with the vimentin IFs in a way similar to the Si – OH groups of the hydrophilic glass . Hence inde - pendent of any interaction mediated by membrane proteins , vimentin IFs may in vivo strongly bind to and equilibrate on the plasma membrane , thereby forming a mechanically stable moiety similar to that observed in the eye lens . 23 Molecular origin of IF ﬂexibility One would assume that in the case of protein ﬁlaments such as , for example , vimentin IFs , a physical parameter like the persistence length should be directly related to their supramolecular architecture and the interactions between neigh - bouring subunits within the ﬁlament . The average vimentin IF cross - section typically contains 16 coiled - coil dimers ( , 45 nm long each ) that are assumed to be aligned approximately parallel to the ﬁlament axis . Depending on the position in the ﬁlament , adjacent dimers can be oriented parallel or antiparallel , unstaggered or approxi - mately half - staggered . The lateral interactions between dimers appear relatively strong , since IFs are able to withstand the combined challenge of non - ionic detergents , high salt , ice - cold tempera - ture , and mechanical homogenisation . 24 However , during the in vitro assembly process , a distinct tetramer formed by two antiparallel , approximately half - staggered dimers exhibits kinked conformations due to the presence of linkers joining the four different coiled - coil seg - ments , i . e . as emphasised by EM data of vertebrate and invertebrate cytoplasmic IFs . 25 , 26 This molecu - lar ﬂexibility of the tetramers certainly affects the bending rigidity of cytoplasmic IFs . However , it cannot readily explain why the assembly process is very sensitive to variations of pH and tempera - ture thereby yielding totally aberrant ﬁlamentous or globular products . 9 Cross - linking experiments on hair keratin IFs assembled in vitro under oxidising or reducing conditions have demonstrated that the supra - molecular organisation of IFs can be altered by an axial sliding of the constitutive dimers within the ﬁlament . 27 Small - angle X - ray scattering experi - ments on stretched hair ﬁbres have documented that such an axial sliding of dimers can also be mechanically induced within a dense array of IFs . 28 In fact , a “tetramer switching” mechanism was proposed before , where the two dimers inside a tetramer could slide along each other due to pH or temperature changes , thereby yielding different tetramer types and hence different IF structures . 29 In order to get an idea of what can be the effect of this axial sliding mechanism on the ﬂexibility of IFs , we can estimate the persistence length of a ﬁlament that would be a one - dimensional liquid of coiled coils implying that there is no signiﬁcant lateral correlation between the dimers . According to equation ( 1 ) the energy necessary to bend such a ﬁlament is equal to the number of coiled coils per ﬁlament cross - section multiplied by the bend - ing energy of an individual coiled coil . This means that the persistence length of the ﬁlament is simply 16 times the persistence length of an individual coiled coil , i . e . 25 ( ^ 15 ) nm , 30 thereby yielding a persistence length l of 400 ( ^ 240 ) nm , a value roughly two times smaller than our experimentally determined value . Evidently , this estimate is too low , since real IFs are not disordered structures as has been documented by X - ray scattering data of keratin - rich tissues like porcupine quill . 31 Taken together , the measured persistence length of vimentin IFs arises from the molecular ﬂexibility of the dimers comprising the ﬁlament and from a limited axial sliding of the dimers relative to each other within the ﬁlament . However , other hypotheses have been proposed in the literature . 21 Comparing the ﬂexibility of IFs and F - actin ﬁlaments The basic principles that we used to describe qualitatively the ﬂexibility of IFs should be also valid for other protein ﬁlaments such as F - actin ﬁlaments and microtubules . The case of F - actin ﬁlaments is particularly interesting . Depending on buffer conditions and the presence of binding proteins , they exhibit a persistence length ranging between 3 m m and 10 m m , 32 , 33 which is at least threefold larger than the values measured for vimentin IFs . IFs and F - actin ﬁlaments can reach similar lengths and they reveal a similar outer diameter , i . e . 10 nm and 9 nm , respectively . However , the molecular architecture of the two ﬁlaments is very different , typically yielding a mass - per - length of , 16 kDa / nm for F - actin ﬁlaments 34 and , 36 kDa / nm for vimentin IFs . 35 Intuitively , since both ﬁlaments are protein poly - mers , we would predict that the ﬁlament with the lower mass - per - length , i . e . the F - actin ﬁlament , should be more ﬂexible than the vimentin IF . This apparent contradiction may be best explained by analysing the molecular origin of the bending stiff - ness of F - actin ﬁlaments . To a ﬁrst approximation , F - actin is a two - stranded helical ﬁlament built from a 43 kDa globular subunit . The inter - subunit interactions along the two long - pitch helical strands are generally considered stronger than those occurring between the two strands . 36 – 38 A priori this particular inter - subunit bonding pattern allows for some lateral slipping between adjacent subunits of the two strands . 39 Practically , as the registration between the two strands is fairly well deﬁned , only a small amount of axial slippage occurs . In other words , the two strands forming Vimentin Filament Flexibility 1247 the F - actin ﬁlament are tightly bound together yielding a higher persistence length than the one measured for vimentin IFs . As for IFs , the amount of axial molecular motion that can take place without disrupting the molecular architecture appears to be the key factor governing the ﬂexibility of F - actin ﬁlaments . Following this basic principle , the effect of cations , drugs or inter - acting proteins on the ﬂexibility of IFs and F - actin ﬁlaments could be readily understood . 33 Biological signiﬁcance of IF ﬂexibility ? Not only do actin ﬁlaments and microtubules serve as “tracks” for molecular motors to move cargoes , but they are also responsible for the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton which , in turn , determine cell plasticity and drive cell moti - lity and remodelling of cell shape . In contrast , the cytoplasmic IF network is generally considered as a relatively inert and mechanically resistant scaffold . 40 This picture appears somehow contra - dictory , since IFs are more ﬂexible than F - actin ﬁlaments and microtubules , as elaborated here . The molecular origin of this ﬂexibility , i . e . a high potential for axial sliding of the dimers relative to one another within the ﬁlament , may qualify cyto - plasmic IFs as mechanical signal transducers . 41 In this context , cells and tissues exhibit a wide spectrum of responses to mechanical stimuli like , for example , shear stress . This indicates that a mechanical signal may be transduced , i . e . via the IF network , from the plasma membrane to the nucleus where a speciﬁc response is triggered . 42 , 43 Based on immunoﬂuorescence studies of epi - thelial cells , keratin IF bundles , i . e . tonoﬁbrils , have been implicated in the transmission of mechanical forces throughout the cytoplasm . 44 , 45 These tonoﬁbrils also reveal wave - like patterns or kinks that can propagate along their length in synchrony with phosphorylation / dephosphoryla - tion cycles . 46 This spatial propagation of a distinct ﬁlament deformation pattern along the length of an IF bundle is in agreement with our in vitro model of vimentin IF ﬂexibility involving an axial sliding of dimers relative to one another . Ideally this sliding process can proceed all along the length of the ﬁlament in a very effective manner , i . e . without disrupting its molecular architecture . In contrast , the rigidity and inter - subunit coupling of F - actin ﬁlaments is such that a local deformation is only propagated over a few subunits before it is “fading out” or even reversed . 39 Materials and Methods Recombinant vimentin Human vimentin was expressed and puriﬁed as described . 47 The protein was stored at 2 80 8 C in 8 M urea , 5 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM methyl ammonium chloride . The day before use , the protein was dialysed into 2 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM DTT , at room tem - perature by lowering the urea concentration in a step - wise fashion ( 6 M , 4 M , 2 M , 0 M ) . Dialysis was continued overnight at 4 8 C into fresh buffer without urea . The next day the protein was dialysed for one hour at 4 8 C into 2 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) . Filament assembly was performed by adding an equal volume of 200 mM KCl in 2 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) to a 0 . 4 mg / ml vimentin solution , at 37 8 C . After 20 minutes to one hour , the ﬁlament solution was diluted 1 : 80 to 1 : 300 in 2 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM KCl , and 30 m l aliquots were allowed to adsorb to a solid support for at least ﬁve minutes prior to AFM imaging . Surface preparation Three kinds of solid supports were used in this study : Muscovite mica , highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( HOPG ) , and hydrophilic glass . Mica and HOPG were freshly cleaved immediately before use . To obtain a hydrophilic glass surface , we used the following proto - col . Standard light microscopy cover slips were washed with ethanol and water , and then exposed for one hour to “Piranha solution” , a mixture of three parts H 2 SO 4 ( 97 % ) and one part H 2 O 2 ( 30 % ) . Next , the cover slips were rinsed in water , exposed twice to ultrasound waves ( 50 kHz ) for ten minutes , and ﬁnally dried under a stream of nitrogen . After such treatment , the surface is covered by Si – OH groups that are stable for a few hours . The supports were mounted for AFM imaging in two different ways , both of which proved equally suited . Either , a small piece of support was glued onto a Teﬂon disc by water - insoluble epoxy glue ( Araldit ; Ciba - Geigy , Basel , Switzerland ) . The Teﬂon disc was then glued ( cyanoacrylate glue ) to a steel disc and mounted onto the piezoelectric scanner . Or alternatively , a large piece of support was directly glued to a steel disc . Electron microscopy For electron microscopy ( EM ) , ﬁlament assembly was terminated after 20 minutes to one hour by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer ( 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) glutaral - dehyde in 100 mM KCl , 2 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 ) . After three to ﬁve minutes , 5 m l aliquots were adsorbed for one minute to glow - discharged carbon - coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate for visualisation using a Zeiss 900 transmission electron microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Oberko - chen , Germany ) . For image processing , prints enlarged ﬁve times from the original negative ( 50 , 000 £ ) were digitised . Atomic force microscopy For scanning in air the sample was prepared by the following protocol : 20 m l of assembled vimentin IFs diluted to 0 . 5 – 2 m g / ml were adsorbed for ten minutes to a freshly cleaved piece of mica . The mica was then washed carefully with 500 m l of assembly buffer ( 2 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM KCl ) to remove all non - bound ﬁlaments . Next , the ﬁlaments attached to the mica were incubated for ten minutes with 100 m l glutar - aldehyde ( 0 . 5 % in 2 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 ) to stabilise their structure before they were washed with 1248 Vimentin Filament Flexibility 2 ml distilled water and dried under a steady stream of nitrogen . For operating in air we used 125 m m long silicon cantilevers ( type NCH from Nanosensors , Neuchaˆtel , Switzerland ) , which had a nominal spring constant of 21 – 78 N / m . The cantilever drive frequency was chosen between 200 kHz and 300 kHz , and the scanner drive frequency was ﬁxed to 3 Hz . For scanning in liquid the sample was prepared by adsorbing 20 m l of assembled vimentin IFs , diluted to 0 . 5 – 2 m g / ml , for ﬁve minutes to the different solid supports described above . We used 100 m m long cantilevers with oxide sharpened silicon nitride tips , which had a nominal spring constant of 0 . 38 N / m ( type NP - S from Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , USA ) . The cantilever drive frequency was chosen between 7 . 5 kHz and 9 . 5 kHz , and the scanner drive frequency was ﬁxed to 2 Hz . All AFM images were recorded in tapping - mode using a Nanoscope IIIa running with software version 5 . 12r3 ( Digital instruments , Santa Barbara , USA ) , operated at room temperature . 512 £ 512 pixels images were recorded at a scan size of either 10 m m or 20 m m , thus resulting in pixel sizes of 20 nm or 40 nm , respec - tively . For further image processing , 10 m m size zooms were extracted from the 20 m m scans using the Nanoscope III software . AFM images were processed using the ImageJ soft - ware . ImageJ is a version of the NIH - Image software developed by the National Institutes of Health . It is a public domain software † . Filament contours were traced and exported as XY - coordinate sets by using either the “Freehand Linetool” or a skeleton algorithm implemented in Image J . Data analysis The XY - coordinate sets of the ﬁlament contours were analysed using Thetascan 1 . 0 developed by N . Mu¨cke in Origin 7 . 0 . To assess the inﬂuence of pixel number and the errors introduced by the freehand tracing of the ﬁlament contours , computer - generated ﬁlaments were ﬁrst pixelised and their contours traced in the same way as done with the experimental data . It was found that the experimental data acquisition errors can be minimised by a smoothing procedure using the weight average of ﬁve contiguous XY - coordinates centred about a given XY - coordinate : V i ; correct ¼ 1 V i 2 2 þ 2 V i 2 1 þ 4 V i þ 2 V i þ 1 þ 1 V i þ 2 10 ð 10 Þ where V i is the vector of the tangent to the curve on XY - coordinate i : Note that this procedure removes two points at each end of the ﬁlament . Next , the corrected XY - coordinate sets of the ﬁlament contours were split into segments of increasing contour length in 100 nm increments . 20 For each segment set of contour length s , the mean - square angle k Q 2 l ; the normalised mean - fourth power of the angle k Q 4 l = k Q 2 l 2 and the mean - square end - to - end distance k R 2 l were computed .
