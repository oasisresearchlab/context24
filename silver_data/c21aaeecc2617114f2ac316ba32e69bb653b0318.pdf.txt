Although EVs are highly anticipated to be a next - generation intracellular delivery tool because of their pharmaceutical advantages , including non - immunogenicity , their cellular uptake efficacy is low because of the repulsion of EVs and negatively charged cell membranes and size limitations in endocytosis . Here , we demonstrate a methodology for achieving enhanced cellular EV uptake using arginine - rich cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) to induce active macropinocytosis . The induction of macropinocytosis via a simple modification to the exosomal membrane using stearylated octaarginine , which is a representative CPP , significantly enhanced the cellular EV uptake efficacy . Consequently , effective EV - based intracellular delivery of an artificially encapsulated ribosome - inactivating protein , saporin , in EVs was attained . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs , exosomes ) are cellular vesicles ( 30 – 200 nm in diameter ) with a lipid bilayer that are constitutively secreted from most cells . EVs are found in abundance in bodily fluids , such as blood , saliva , urine , and breast milk 1 – 3 . In cell - to - cell communication , EVs transport genetic materials ( e . g . , microRNAs ) and enzymes to other cells , resulting in signal transduction for cell regulation and the modulation of the immune response 1 – 3 . Secreted EVs can transport biologically functional molecules to other cells via endocytosis , such as tetraspanin membrane proteins ( CD9 , CD63 , CD81 , CD82 ) , proteins involved in multivesicular body biogenesis ( Alix , TSG101 ) , heat - shock proteins ( Hsp70 , Hsp90 ) , other bioactive proteins ( GTPases , annexins , flotillin ) , and raft - associated lipids ( e . g . , cholesterol , ceramide , sphingolipids , phosphoglycerides , phospholipases ) encapsulated in EVs 4 , 5 . EVs have been examined as intracellular delivery carriers of therapeutic genes for cellular regulation 3 , 6 – 8 . However , to achieve the effective intracellular delivery of EV contents , the cellular uptake efficacy of EVs must increase , as many EVs are present in bodily fluids , leading to competition for cellular uptake . Moreover , the neg - ative charge of EV membranes prevents them from accumulating on negatively charged cellular membranes 9 , 10 . Endocytosis has been shown to be a major route for cellular EV uptake 11 – 14 . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis has a size limitation ( approximately 120 nm ) for cellular uptake from outside of the cells 15 , and this route of cellular uptake is considered inefficient for the cellular uptake of EVs ( which are approximately 200 nm in size ) . However , our research group recently reported that active induction of macropinocytosis ( accompanied by actin reorganization , ruffling of the plasma membrane , and engulfment of large volumes of extracellular fluid ) 16 , 17 by cancer - related receptors ( e . g . , epidermal growth factor receptor ) and the expression of oncogenic K - Ras significantly enhances cellular EV uptake 9 . Combined treatment of EVs with ligands for macropinocytosis induction ( e . g . , epidermal growth factor ) increases the cellular EV uptake efficacy ; however , this experimental technique is considered ineffective in in vivo treatment due to the dispersal of EVs in bodily fluid . Thus , the artificial induction of macropinocytosis stimulated by the functionalized EV itself is strongly considered very useful for the EV - based intracellular delivery of therapeutic molecules . 1 Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research Center , Research Organization for the 21st Century , Osaka Prefecture University , Naka - ku , Sakai , Osaka 599 - 8570 , Japan . 2 Graduate School of Science , Osaka Prefecture University , Naka - ku , Sakai , Osaka 599 - 8531 , Japan . 3 Institute for Chemical Research , Kyoto University , Uji , Kyoto 611 - 0011 , Japan .

Arginine - rich CPPs , including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) Tat ( 48 – 60 ) peptide and oligoarginine peptides , have been reported to be promising carriers for the intracellular delivery of various bioac - tive molecules , such as proteins , peptides , and nucleic acids 18 , 19 . Macropinocytosis has also been shown to be an important pathway for the physiological cellular uptake of arginine - rich CPPs 20 – 24 . Recently , our research group also found that the octaarginine peptide , which is a representative arginine - rich CPP , induces the clustering of the syndecan - 4 proteoglycan on plasma membranes , resulting in the binding of PKC α to the V domain of the proteo - glycan in the cytosol and the activation of PKC α 25 . The induction of proteoglycan clustering and PKC α activation results in the induction of macropinocytosis and the effective cellular uptake of the peptide 25 . In this report , we propose a simple and effective technique for enhancing the cellular uptake of EVs using arginine - rich CPPs . The modification of arginine - rich CPPs highly enhances the cellular uptake of EVs via the active induction of mac - ropinocytosis without any cytotoxicity . We also achieved the efficient cytosolic delivery of a ribosome - inactivating protein , saporin , using arginine - rich CPP - modified EVs , leading to the efficient induction of cytotoxicity in tar - geted cells . Results and Discussion Effect of stearyl - r8 modification on the cellular uptake of EVs . In our system , EV membranes were modified with r8 , which is a representative arginine - rich CPP 18 , 19 , by simple mixing with stearyl - r8 , where the stearyl moiety served as an anchoring unit to membranes ( Fig . 1 ) . Tetraspanin CD63 is a marker membrane Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the intracellular delivery of EVs with the modification of arginine - rich cell - penetrating peptide for the active induction of macropinocytosis . Objective therapeutic molecules are encapsulated in EVs by electroporation . EVs are then modified with stearyl - r8 peptide on EV membranes , resulting in the active induction of macropinocytosis and effective cellular uptake . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 34937 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep34937 protein of the EV , and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - fused CD63 stably expressing HeLa cells ( CD63 - GFP - HeLa ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) were prepared in these experiments . Secreted CD63 - GFP EVs were isolated from the cell culture medium via ultracentrifugation methods 26 , and the expression of the EV marker protein CD63 was detected using western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . After the EVs were mixed with the peptide , the removal of excess stearyl - r8 peptide , which was not modified on EV membranes , was accomplished by washing and filtration using centrifugal filters . The zeta - potential of the stearyl - r8 - modified EV was shown to be 5 . 1 mV , and the average diameter of the EVs was 196 . 9 ± 46 . 7 nm , as determined using the zeta - potential and a particle size analyzer ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Conversely , the average diameter of the original isolated EVs without mod - ification of the stearyl - r8 peptide was 116 . 4 ± 49 . 2 nm ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) , and the zeta - potential of isolated EVs was − 12 . 5 mV , which is similar to previously reported values 9 , 10 , suggesting an increase in the charge of the EV membrane by the modification of the stearyl - r8 peptide . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) obser - vations of the stearyl - r8 - modified EV showed vesicular structures similar to the original isolated EVs without modification of the stearyl - r8 peptide ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Next , the cellular uptake efficacy of the stearyl - r8 - modified EV was evaluated using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry . Marked induction of macropinocytosis , which facilitated the cellular uptake of EVs into cells , was attained by surface modification with stearyl - r8 peptide , as was also observed for liposomes modified with octaarginine 27 – 29 . Figure 2b shows a confocal microscopic image of HeLa cells ( derived from human cer - vix adenocarcinoma ) treated with CD63 - GFP - EVs ( 10 μ g / ml ) in 10 % serum - containing cell culture medium for 24 h at 37 °C . When the cells were treated with CD63 - GFP - EVs without modification of stearyl - r8 peptide , very low cellular uptake efficacy of the EVs was observed ( Fig . 2b ) . However , in the case of the modification of stearyl - r8 ( 16 μ M ) on EV membranes , comparatively highly fluorescent signals of CD63 - GFP - EVs taken up by the cells were observed ( Fig . 2b ) . Flow cytometry analysis also showed that the cellular EV uptake was 33 - fold higher due to the modification of stearyl - r8 ( Fig . 2c ) . When the cells were treated with CD63 - GFP - EVs premixed with r8 peptide without the stearyl moiety , the cellular EV uptake efficacy was similar to that of the original EV ( Fig . 2b , c ) , suggesting that the stearyl moiety is essential for the modification of the r8 peptide on EV membranes . The cellular uptake efficacy of EVs modified with stearyl - r8 peptide is dependent on the peptide concentration ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . A peptide concentration of 16 μ M for the EV membrane modification ( 10 μ g / ml EV ) resulted in effective cellular uptake efficacy ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . However , in the case of a low concentration of stearyl - r8 ( 1 . 6 μ M ) , the cellular EV uptake efficacy was only slightly affected ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . In addition , fluorescently labeled peptide ( stearyl - r8 - GC ( Alexa488 ) ) was used to confirm the binding of the stearyl - r8 peptide to EV membranes using a spectrofluorometer , and this method resulted in the binding of stearyl - r8 - GC ( Al - exa488 ) ( 221 nM ) on 10 μ g / ml of EVs . However , in the case of r8 - GC ( Alexa488 ) without a stearyl moiety , this method resulted in less binding of r8 - GC ( Alexa488 ) ( 10 nM ) on 10 μ g / ml of EVs . We also confirmed the internal - ization of EVs by other cells , such as A431 cells ( derived from human epidermoid carcinoma ) and CHO - K1 cells ( derived from Chinese hamster ovary ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - EVs ( without modification of stearyl - r8 ) into A431 cells was shown to have very low efficacy ( 23 . 4 - fold and 17 . 8 - fold lower than that of CHO - K1 and HeLa cells , respectively ) in the experimental condition of CD63 - GFP - EV ( 10 μ g / ml ) uptake in 10 % serum - containing cell culture medium for 24 h at 37 °C . However , the modification of stearyl - r8 ( 16 μ M ) on the EV membrane had a significant effect on cellular EV uptake in A431 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The cell viability of the treatment with stearyl - r8 - modified EVs was tested using the WST - 1 assay , and almost no cytotoxicity was observed ( Supplementary Figs 3 and 5 ) . Active induction of macropinocytosis by stearyl - r8 - modified EVs . To examine the cellular uptake mechanisms of the stearyl - r8 - modified EV , we tested the induction of macropinocytosis by the treatment of the EV on cells . First , we tested cellular EV uptake under low temperature ( 4 °C ) , which is an experimental condi - tion for the prevention of endocytosis 21 . Supplementary Fig . 6a shows the flow cytometer analysis of HeLa cells treated with stearyl - r8 - modified CD63 - GFP - EV - containing cell culture medium for 2 h at 37 °C or 4 °C . In the case of the 4 °C treatment , the cellular uptake efficacy of stearyl - r8 - modified CD63 - GFP - EV was greatly reduced compared with the 37 °C treatment , which suggested that energy - dependent endocytosis is important for the cellular uptake of the EV . Next , we tested the macropinocytosis induction of stearyl - r8 - modified EV analyzed using FITC - dextran ( molecular weight : 70 , 000 ) , which is a marker of macropinocytotic cellular uptake 20 , 30 . The activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) induces macropinocytosis 9 , and the EGF treatment on HeLa cells increased the cellular uptake of FITC - dextran ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Figure 3a shows the results of a flow cytometer analysis of HeLa cells treated with FITC - dextran in the presence or absence of stearyl - r8 - modified EVs . Co - treatment of FITC - dextran with stearyl - r8 - modified EVs resulted in the enhanced cellular uptake of FITC - dextran ( Fig . 3a ) . However , EVs without modification of the stearyl - r8 peptide did not increase the cellular uptake of FITC - dextran ( Fig . 3a ) , which suggested that the modification of the stearyl - r8 peptide on EV membranes effectively enhanced the cellular uptake route of macropinocytosis . Confocal microscopic observations also showed the colocalization of Texas red - dextran and stearyl - r8 - modified CD63 - GFP - EV inside cells after their cellular uptake ( Fig . 3b ) , which suggested cellular EV uptake via the mac - ropinocytosis route . 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride 16 , 21 ( EIPA ) is a representative macropinocytosis inhibitor , and the cellular uptake of the macropinocytosis marker FITC - dextran ( molecular weight : 70 , 000 ) was decreased under the cellular treatment with EIPA ( Supplementary Fig . S6b ) . The cellular uptake of stearyl - r8 - modified CD63 - GFP - EVs was significantly decreased by treatment with EIPA ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . However , the EIPA treatment did not affect the cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - EVs without the modification of stearyl - r8 on the EV membranes ( Supplementary Fig . S6d ) . We recently reported that the enhanced clustering of syndecan - 4 , a pro - teoglycan , by arginine - rich CPPs on plasma membranes is important for the binding of PKC α to the syndecan - 4 V - domain inside cells and inducing macropinocytosis 25 . Thus , in this study , we also confirmed whether the clustering of syndecan - 4 on the plasma membrane and stearyl - r8 - modified EVs induced syndecan - 4 clustering www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 34937 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep34937 Figure 2 .

We also found that lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling by actin organization could be observed when the cells were treated with stearyl - r8 - modified EVs ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . However , EVs without peptide modification could not induce lamellipodia formation ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , which suggested that the modification of stearyl - r8 on the EV membrane is important for the active induction of membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis . Enhanced cellular uptake of bioactive protein - encapsulated EVs modified by stearyl - r8 . Next , we examined the cellular uptake of cargo molecules artificially encapsulated in EVs . First , we prepared FITC - dextran ( molecular weight : 70 , 000 ) - encapsulated EVs via electroporation 10 . Supplementary Fig . 10a shows confocal microscopic images of HeLa cells treated with FITC - dextran - encapsulated EVs for 24 h at 37 °C . The Figure 3 .

The arrows show representative lamellipodia formations . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 34937 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep34937 modification of the stearyl - r8 peptide on EV membranes enhanced their cellular uptake even at lower protein concentrations of EVs ( 1 μ g / ml ) than those employed in Fig . 2b . Under the same experimental conditions , the fluorescence intensity in the cells was analyzed using a flow cytometer ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) , and increased fluorescence intensity was detected from the FITC - dextran - encapsulated EVs modified with stearyl - r8 efficiently taken up by the cells ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) . In addition , we encapsulated the ribosome - inactivating protein saporin 31 , 32 , which functions as an anti - cancer drug , in EVs via electroporation using an experimental method similar to that used to encapsulate FITC - dextran in EVs ( Fig . 4a ) . HeLa cells were treated with saporin - encapsulated EVs for 72 h at 37 °C prior to microscopic observation and WST - 1 assay ( Fig . 4b , c ) . With the modification of stearyl - r8 on EV membranes , the cytotoxicity of encapsulated saporin in EVs was significantly enhanced ( Fig . 4b , c ) . However , saporin - encapsulated EVs with - out the modification of stearyl - r8 on EV membranes showed low cytotoxicity ( Fig . 4b , c ) , which suggested that the enhanced cellular uptake and cytosolic release of saporin originally encapsulated in EVs was effectively achieved in the cytosol by the modification of stearyl - r8 on EV membranes . Conclusion In this study , we successfully developed an EV - based intracellular delivery system via the effective induction of macropinocytosis by the modification of the arginine - rich cell - penetrating peptide on EV membranes . The macropinocytosis route can take up large molecules from outside cells ( > 1 μ m ) 15 , and this route is considered well - suited for cellular EV uptake due to its vesicular size 9 .

The concentration of saporin encapsulated in 10 μ g / ml EVs was estimated to be approximately 43 . 5 ng / ml using the FITC - labeled saporin .

Thus , this technique promisingly maintains the functionality of EV membrane proteins during their cellular uptake despite the modi - fication of stearyl - r8 on the EV membranes . Our study is the first to apply this modification system to biologically generated cellular vesicles , EVs . Our results should provide fundamental knowledge to further establish EV - based intracellular delivery systems , and our findings contribute to not only the development of EV - based intracellular delivery but also our understanding of EV functionality . Methods Peptide synthesis . All peptides were chemically synthesized via 9 - fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl ( Fmoc ) solid - phase peptide synthesis on a Rink amide resin with a coupling system using 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole ( HOBt ) / 2 - ( 1H - benzotriazole - 1 - yl ) - 1 , 1 , 3 , 3 - tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate ( HBTU ) ( Peptide Institute , Osaka , Japan ) / N , N - diisopropylethylamine ( DIEA ) as previously described 23 , 33 . The Fmoc - amino acid deriva - tives and the Rink amide resin were purchased from the Peptide Institute ( Osaka , Japan ) and Shimadzu Biotech ( Kyoto , Japan ) , respectively . For the preparation of the stearylated peptide , the N - terminus of the peptide resin was reacted with the stearyl acid with diisopropylcarbodiimide in the presence of HOBt as coupling agents as previously reported 33 . The deprotection of the protected peptide and cleavage from the resin were performed via treatment with a trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) / ethanedithiol ( EDT ) mixture ( 95 : 5 ) for 3 h at 20 °C , followed by purification with reverse - phase high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . Based on the analytical HPLC , the purity of each peptide was estimated to be > 97 % . The structures of the synthesized peptides were confirmed using matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI - TOFMS ) ( Microflex , Bruker , Billerica , MA , USA ) .

The human epidermoid carcinoma - derived A431 cells and Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . Each cell was cultured in α - MEM ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation , Grand Island , NY , USA ) ( HeLa cells ) , minimum essen - tial medium ( MEM ) ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation ) ( A431 cells ) , and F - 12 nutrient mixture ( Ham’s F - 12 ) ( CHO - K1 ) ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation ) containing 10 % heat - inactivated FBS ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation ) .

The collected cell culture medium was centrifuged ( 300 × g ) for 10 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was centrifuged ( 2 , 000 × g ) for 10 min at 4 °C and again centrifuged ( 10 , 000 × g ) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris . The supernatant was then centrifuged ( 100 , 000 × g ) for 70 min at 4 °C ( Himac CP65 β , Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) in duplicate , and the pellet was collected in PBS . The concentrations of isolated EVs were described in terms of their protein concentrations , which were determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . , Rockford , IL , USA ) . Western blotting analysis . Isolated EVs were added to lysis buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl ( pH = 6 . 8 ) , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 002 % bromophenol blue , 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) . The boiled samples were separated via 10 % SDS - PAGE , transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) , and treated with anti - CD63 antibody ( TS63 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . A secondary antibody labeled with horse - radish peroxidase ( anti - rabbit IgG HRP - linked whole antibody donkey , GE Healthcare ) was used , and immuno - reactive species were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence ( ECL ) Plus Western Blotting Detection System ( GE Healthcare ) with the Amersham Imager 600 ( GE Healthcare ) . Immunoreactive species were detected at a position of approximately 50 kDa in SDS - PAGE analysis using the anti - CD63 antibody . Modification of EVs with stearyl - r8 peptide . Synthesized stearyl - r8 peptide ( final 40 μ M ) diluted with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) was added to a solution of EVs ( 100 μ g ) in PBS ( total 800 μ l ) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C . Removal of unattached stearyl - r8 peptide was accomplished by washing with PBS and filtration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters ( 100K device , Merck Millipore ) . The attachment of stearyl - r8 - GC ( Alexa488 ) and r8 - GC ( Alexa488 ) to EVs was confirmed using a spectrofluorometer ( FP - 6200 , JASCO , Tokyo , Japan ) . Confocal microscopy . Cells ( 2 × 10 5 cells , 2 ml ) were plated onto a 35 - mm glass dish ( Iwaki , Tokyo , Japan ) and incubated in cell culture medium ( HeLa cells , α - MEM ; A431 cells , MEM ; CHO - K1 cells , Ham’s F - 12 ) con - taining 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell cul - ture medium containing 10 % FBS and treated with each EV sample ( 100 μ l / well ) . The cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye ( Invitrogen ; 5 μ g / ml ) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to cell washing . The cells were then washed with fresh cell culture medium and analyzed using a FV1200 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a 40 × or 60 × objective without cell fixation . For the detection of macropinocytosis uptake , co - treatment with Texas red - dextran ( molecular weight : 70 , 000 , 0 . 5 mg / ml ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) with EV samples was performed . For the detection of syndecan - 4 clustering , the cells were treated with EV ( without CD63 - GFP expression , 10 μ g / ml ) modified with or without stearyl - r8 ( 16 μ M ) for 1 h at 37 °C . After the removal of the medium , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and washed with PBS . The cells were then treated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( 100 μ l / well in PBS ) at room temperature for 5 min and again washed with PBS . The expression of syndecan - 4 was visualized by treatment with syndecan - 4 antibody ( sc - 12766 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , and secondary antibody labeled with fluorescence ( Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) , Invitrogen ) was then used ( each 30 min at room temperature ) prior to analysis using a FV1200 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus ) . Flow cytometry . Cells ( 4 . 7 × 10 4 cells , 1 ml ) were plated onto a 24 - well microplate ( Iwaki ) and incubated in cell culture medium ( HeLa cells , α - MEM ; A431 cells , MEM ; CHO - K1 cells , Ham’s F - 12 ) containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell culture medium con - taining 10 % FBS and treated with each EV sample or macropinocytosis marker , FITC - labeled dextran ( molec - ular weight : 70 , 000 , 0 . 5 mg / ml ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ( 600 μ l / well ) prior to washing with 0 . 5 mg / ml heparin in PBS ( triple washing , 200 μ l ) . The cells were then treated with 0 . 01 % trypsin at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of PBS ( 200 μ l ) and then centrifuged at 1 , 500 rpm ( 200 × g ) for 5 min at 4 °C . After the removal of the superna - tant , the cells were washed with PBS ( 400 μ l ) and centrifuged at 1 , 500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C . This washing cycle was repeated , and the cells were suspended in PBS ( 400 μ l ) and subjected to fluorescence analysis with a Guava easyCyte ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) flow cytometer using 488 - nm laser excitation and a 525 - nm emission filter . Live cells ( 10 , 000 cells / sample ) for the detection of cellular fluorescence intensity were quantified based on forward - scattering and side - scattering analyses . For induction of macropinocytosis in Supplementary Figs 6b and 7 , cellular uptake experiments were conducted in the presence of human epidermal growth factor ( EGF , Sigma - Aldrich ) ( 100 nM ) . In the macropinocytosis inhibition assay , the cells were pretreated with the macropinocytosis inhibitor 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride 16 , 21 ( EIPA , Sigma - Aldrich ) in MEM containing 10 % FBS ( 100 μ M , 600 μ l / well ) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to treatment with each sample ( 600 μ l / well ) and in MEM containing 10 % FBS ( 200 μ l / well ) in the presence or absence of EIPA ( 100 μ M ) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to flow cytometry analysis . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 34937 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep34937 Electron microscopy . Suspended EVs in PBS ( 30 μ g / ml ) were dropped onto a carbon - coated grid ( 400 mesh ) and washed with distilled water . Uranyl acetate was applied to the grid and left for 10 s at room temper - ature . Next , the reagent was removed with filter paper and dried prior to imaging with a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) ( JEM1200EX , JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) . Zeta - potential and particle size . The zeta - potential and particle size of the EVs diluted in PBS ( 58 . 2 μ g / ml ) were determined using the zeta - potential and particle size analyzer ELSZ - DN2 ( Otsuka Electronics , Osaka , Japan ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell ruffling assay . HeLa cells ( 2 × 10 5 cells , 2 ml ) were plated onto a 35 - mm glass dish ( Iwaki ) and incu - bated in cell culture medium ( α - MEM ) containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell culture medium containing 10 % FBS and treated with each EV sample ( 100 μ l / well ) for 20 min at 37 °C . After removal of the medium , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and washed with PBS . The cells were then treated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( 100 μ l / well in PBS ) at room temperature for 5 min and again washed with PBS . Cellular F - actin was stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) for 20 min at 4 °C , and the cells were washed with PBS prior to analysis using a FV1200 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with a 40 × objective . Preparation of FITC - labeled saporin . For the preparation of FITC - labeled saporin , saporin ( 200 μ g , saporin from Saponaria officinalis seeds , Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in H 2 O ( 100 μ l ) was reacted with 2 equivalents of FITC ( Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( 10 μ l ) and N , N - diisopropylethylamine ( 0 . 5 μ l ) at 30 °C for 2 h as previously reported 9 , 10 . To remove the unreacted FITC , gel filtration on a Sephadex G - 25 column ( PD - 10 , GE Healthcare ) was performed prior to lyophilization . The protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit . Encapsulation of fluorescently labeled dextran and saporin into EVs . To load the fluorescently labeled dextran into EVs , EVs ( 25 μ g ) were mixed with FITC - labeled dextran ( molecular weight : 70 , 000 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or saporin ( 50 μ g ) in PBS ( 100 μ l ) . After electroporation ( poring pulse : two pulses ( 200 V , 5 msec ) ; transfer pulse : five pulses ( 20 V , 50 msec ) ) in a 1 - cm electroporation cuvette at room temperature using a super electroporater NEPA21 Type II ( NEPA Genes , Tokyo , Japan ) , the unencapsulated FITC - dextran or saporin was removed by washing and filtration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters ( 100 K device ) , as previously reported 9 , 10 . Loading of FITC - dextran and FITC - saporin into EVs was confirmed using a spectrofluorometer ( FP - 6200 , JASCO , Tokyo , Japan ) 9 , 10 , and the loading concentration was calculated on the basis of the calibration curve of FITC ( excitation : 488 nm ; emission : 530 nm ) . The electroporation method resulted in the encapsulation of FITC - dextran ( 5 ng / ml ) in 1 μ g / ml of EVs . The efficiency of dextran encapsulation into EVs was calculated to be 0 . 3 % . The concentration of saporin encapsulated in 10 μ g / ml EVs was estimated to be approximately 43 . 5 ng / ml using the FITC - labeled saporin . The efficiency of saporin encapsulation into EVs was calculated to be 0 . 2 % . Cell viability ( WST - 1 assay ) . Cell viability was analyzed using the WST - 1 ( 4 - [ 3 - ( 4 - iodophenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - nitr ophenyl ) - 2H - 5 - tetrazolio ] - 1 , 3 - benzene disulfonate ) assay , as previously described 9 , 10 . Cells ( 1 × 10 4 cells , 100 μ l ) were incubated in 96 - well microplates in cell culture medium containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . The cells were then treated with each EV sample ( 50 μ l ) at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After the sample treatment , WST - 1 reagents ( 10 μ l ) were added to each well and the samples were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C . The absorb - encies at 450 nm ( A450 ) and 620 nm ( A620 ) were measured , and the value obtained by subtracting A620 from A450 corresponded to the viable cell number . Statistical analyses . All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software ( ver . 5 . 00 ; GraphPad , San Diego , CA , USA ) . For comparisons of two groups , unpaired Student’s t - test was used after verification of the equal variances with an F - test . Welch’s correction was performed when the variances across groups were assumed to be unequal . For multiple comparison analyses , one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test or Dunnett’s post hoc test was used . Differences were considered significant when the calculated p - value was < 0 . 05 . References 1 . Tan , A . , Rajadas , J . & Seifalian , A . M .
