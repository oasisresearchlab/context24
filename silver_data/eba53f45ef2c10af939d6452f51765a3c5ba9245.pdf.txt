Their different composi - tion ( metals , lipids , polymers , peptides ) and shapes ( spheres , rods , pyramids , flowers and so on ) are influenced by the synthesis methods and functionalization procedures . However , in the medical field , researchers focus on the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the nanoparticles in their attempts for a targeted therapy in which the nanocarriers need to bypass certain biological barriers . Moreover , the increased interest in molecular imaging has brought nanoparticles in the spotlight for their applications in two distinct directions : therapy and diagnosis . Furthermore , recent advances in nanoparticle designs have introduced novel nano - objects suitable as both detection and delivery systems at the same time , thus providing theranostic applications . Keywords : nanoparticles , nano - oncology , targeted therapy , molecular imaging , diagnosis 1 . Introduction Nanomedicine is able to study the organism and especially the disease at the nanoscale level and offers a lot of structural and functional information for the development of new therapeutics and diagnosis strategies [ 1 ] . Nano - oncology refers to the applications of nanotechnology in the oncology medical field . Oncological malignancies affect worldwide population with an incidence of 18 . 1 million new cancer cases and 9 . 6 million cancer deaths ( GLOBOCAN 2018 ) . Usually , the most used treatment scheme is surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy . These strategies are not very efficient because it does not only affect the disease site , but healthy tissues too , and in many cases , cancer can develop therapy resistance [ 2 ] . Nanotechnology tools have potential to overcome the side effects and the inef - ficiency of some therapies . Due to its small size , nanoparticles ( NPs ) can be used for molecular characterization of the disease , and based on this , it can contribute to discover new therapies . Moreover , various oncological chemotherapeutics are nanoformulated and now are involved in clinical trials [ 3 ] . Besides drug encapsulation , NPs can be used for the delivery of growth factors and other compounds applied in tissue engineering . On the other hand , NPs’ properties are advantageous for new sensing and molecular imaging tools devel - opment ( Figure 1 ) . Cancer Nanotechnology 2 For each of these applications , NPs’ formulations involve various encapsulation procedures , which need to meet specific characteristics . Firstly , the NPs should not interfere with the encapsulated compound pharmacological activity , and it has to prevent its premature degradation and to become biodegradable at the tumor site , thus decreasing its toxicity [ 4 ] . Secondly , for sensing applications , the nanosystem needs to have some unique chemical , electrical , and catalytical properties to provide accuracy of the measurements [ 5 ] . On the other hand , for molecular imaging appli - cations , the NPs benefit from their optical properties like fluorescence in various spectra . Also , the features such as biocompatibility , stability and long circulation time are very important [ 6 – 8 ] . Theranostic side of the nano - oncology field focuses on developing new struc - tures that able to perform efficient target therapy . Therefore , this type of NPs disposes of unique physical and chemical properties for active targeting of the desired cells providing imaging and therapeutic action against the disease [ 8 ] . 2 . Nanoparticles The term “nanoparticles” is intensively used in the nanomedicine field in order to describe a particle with a size in the range of 1 – 100 nm . NPs are designed from a wide class of materials , including metals , silicates , metal oxides , polymers , organics , non - oxide ceramics , carbon and biomolecules . For biomedical applications , NPs are pre - sented in different morphological states such as spheres , tubes , cylinders , platelets [ 9 ] . NPs have surface modifications that can facilitate the internalization / uptake of therapeutic agents and also their capability to travel through the bloodstream to the target sites . Generally , the structure of NPs is composed of three different Figure 1 . Nanotechnology applications in medicine . 3 Theranostic Nanoparticles and Their Spectrum in Cancer DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 88097 layers , including the surface layer ( can be functionalized with a wide range of small molecules , surfactants , metal ions and polymers ) , the shell layer ( consists of dif - ferent chemical material according to the core of the NPs ) and the core ( represents the central portion of the NP ) [ 10 ] . Therefore , NPs have exceptional characteristics due to their structure and design and gained an enormous interest in multidisci - plinary fields such as drug delivery [ 11 ] , cancer therapy , tissue engineering , protein detection , multicolor optical coding for biological assays , manipulation of cells and biomolecules [ 12 ] , imaging , biosensors , hyperthermia , photoablation therapy and gene delivery [ 13 ] . They exhibit special physical and chemical properties like a high surface area - to - volume ratio and also a unique quantum size effect superior to their corresponding bulk materials . Moreover , NPs’ controllable size and shape play an important role in medical applications [ 14 ] . Moreover , there are some nanomateri - als that can exhibit intrinsic therapeutic properties such as gold nanoshells , which have the potential to deliver photothermal therapy [ 15 ] . Currently , the term “theranostics” starts to gain attention in the medical and research field , and it describes single biocompatible and biodegradable nanopar - ticle , which can contain both therapeutic and diagnostic compounds ( Figure 2 ) [ 16 ] . Specifically , theranostic nanoparticles ( TNPs ) have been designed in order to be applied for multiple imaging approaches including optical imaging , ultrasound ( US ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , computed tomography ( CT ) , single - photon computed tomography ( SPECT ) and positron emission tomography ( PET ) [ 17 ] . Moreover , TNPs are able to improve the accumulation and delivery of the active compounds at the tumor site , enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing the intensity of side effects on healthy tissues [ 18 ] , and they can be eliminated from the body in a short period of time and degrade into nontoxic bioproducts [ 19 ] . 2 . 1 Synthesis of NPs Synthesis of NPs can be performed using various methods , which are divided into two main classes such as bottom - up ( chemical synthesis ) and top - down ( mechanical attrition ) approaches ( Figure 3 ) [ 20 ] . Bottom - up method is based Figure 2 . Theranostic nanoparticles used in the medical field in order to improve the diagnosis and therapeutic approaches . Cancer Nanotechnology 4 on larger nanostructures design beginning from smaller building blocks including atoms and molecules . Meanwhile , the top - down approach refers to larger molecules , which are decomposed into smaller building blocks and then converted into suitable NPs [ 10 ] . Traditional chemical and physical methods present some main drawback due to the presence of reducing and stabilizing agents , which carry a risk of toxicity to the environment and also to the cell [ 21 ] . Currently , green chemistry has been suggested as a valuable alternative for metal nanoparticles synthesis that employs biological entities including microorganisms and plant extracts [ 22 ] . The main role of microorganisms ( bacteria and fungi ) is involved in the remediation of toxic materials by reducing metal ions [ 23 ] . The most often used metal for green synthesis is silver , gold , iron , and copper [ 24 ] . Therefore , the size distribution of NPs is strongly depended on the presence of the biocom - pounds , which are found in the extract . These biocompounds ( phenolic compounds , alkaloids , enzymes , terpenoids , proteins , co - enzymes , sugar and others ) are mainly involved in reducing the oxidative state of the metal salts from positive to zero oxidative state [ 25 ] . Few bacteria have been shown the potential to synthesize silver nanoparticles intracellularly where intracellular components have the ability to act as reducing and stabilizing agents , respectively [ 26 ] . Thus , the green synthesis of nanoparticles could be a promising approach to replace many complex physiochemi - cal syntheses due to their advantages such as no need to use toxic chemicals , free from hazardous by - products and also the use of natural capping agents [ 27 ] . In their study , Mirtaheri et al . had succeeded in synthesis of mesoporous tung - sten oxide using a template - assisted sol - gel method , which relies on the photocata - lytic degradation of Rhodamine B [ 28 ] . Mesoporous TiO 2 - SiO 2 were synthesized by Haghighatzadeh et al . using an ultrasonic impregnation method . In addition , under 800° , they synthesized the anatase crystals with higher photocatalytic efficiency for degradation of methylene blue [ 29 ] . Deshmukh et al . synthesized various nanopar - ticles using plant extracts in order to evaluate their antibacterial and antioxidant Figure 3 . Common methods used to synthesis NPs via top - down and bottom - up approaches . 5 Theranostic Nanoparticles and Their Spectrum in Cancer DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 88097 activity for targeted applications [ 30 ] . Another study on this topic is showed by Baltazar - Encarnacion et al . , which described the green synthesis of Ag nanoparti - cles using an E . coli for the production of NPs with antimicrobial properties against bacteria [ 31 ] . Green biosynthesis methods are more reliable and safer than chemical synthesis [ 32 ] . Structural DNA nanotechnology is a precise method , which is used to control the NPs shape . In particular , the DNA - origami method allows the controlled self - assembly of 2D and 3D nanostructures with nanometer precision [ 33 ] . Such nanoparticles can be used to detect short oligonucleotides in a microbead - based assay [ 34 ] and can be applied in the biological field , nanoelectronics and nano - photonics [ 35 ] . Therefore , these designs provide comprehensive understanding of cellular interactions regarding tumor detection strategies [ 36 , 37 ] . Specifically , TNPs can be engineered in several ways . For example , TNPs can be obtained by conjugating therapeutic agents ( chemotherapy and photosensitizers ) to existing imaging NPs ( quantum dots , gold nanocages and iron oxide NPs ) . On the other hand , NPs can encapsulate both imaging and therapeutic agents in biocom - patible nanosystems such as ferritin nanocages , polymeric and porous silica NPs . Other unique NPs such as porphycenes , [ 64Cu ] CuS , gold nanoshells or cages have inherent imaging and therapeutic characteristics [ 19 ] . 2 . 2 Characterization of NPs Physicochemical properties of NPs ( shape , size , composition , optics ) can be analyzed through different techniques . The morphology of NPs is characterized through microscopic techniques includ - ing polarized optical microscopy ( POM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , which are the most relevant techniques in this area . SEM technique provides relevant information regarding the nanoscale level of the NPs [ 38 ] . Moreover , TEM provides features about the bulk material used for NPs synthesis at very low to higher magnification [ 39 ] . The morphological features of the NPs exhibit a relevant interest since their morphology influences the NP’s properties [ 10 ] . Structural characterization is based on the study of the composition and nature of bonding materials . The common techniques used to study the bulk properties are X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) , X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , infrared spectroscopy ( IR ) , Raman , Brunauer - Emmett - Teller ( BET ) , energy dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) and Zeta size analyzer . Through XRD technique , the crystalline structure and the phase of the NPs are identified . The most sensitive technique used to characterize NPs is XPS , which determines the exact element ratio and bonding nature of the elements used for NPs synthesis [ 10 ] . Optical characterizations are widely used to obtain information about the absorption , reflectance , phosphorescence and luminescence of NPs . This method is based on the Beer - Lambert law and basic light principles . These properties are highlighted through several techniques , including diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( DRS ) , UV and UV - Vis , which reveal good knowledge about the mechanism of their photochemical processes [ 10 ] . 2 . 3 Physicochemical properties of NPs For cancer research , NPs can be modified respecting the size , shape and surface to improve their ability to reach tumors . Smaller NPs have the ability to accumulate more easily in the leaky blood vessels of tumor sites compared to larger NPs , which can remain at the injection site [ 40 ] . Cancer Nanotechnology 6 Nowadays , ultrasmall nanoparticles ( 1 – 3 nm cores ) are widely used for medi - cal applications because of their advantages regarding biodistribution , targeting features , adsorption , easy surface modifications and pharmacokinetics [ 18 , 41 – 43 ] . Gadolinium ultrasmall nanoparticles achieved theranostic potential without considerable toxicity in vivo in the case of brain cancers [ 44 ] . Another example is represented by ultrasmall silica nanoparticles functionalized with antibody frag - ments used to target HER2 - overexpressed breast cancer as imaging agents [ 42 ] . Metallic nanoparticles can be designed as ultrasmall constructs too . In this regard , it is important to mention D - peptide p53 activator gold nanoparticle con - jugates used for cancer target therapy [ 45 ] , bimetallic nanoparticles for triggered ultrasound cancer therapy [ 46 ] and Cu ultrasmall nanoparticles’ valuable ability for photothermal cancer therapy [ 47 ] . On the other hand , NP shape influences the fluid dynamics and uptake into tumor sites . Non - spherical NPs present excellent optical properties due to surface plasmon resonances and are strongly recommended for cancer phototherapy applications [ 48 – 50 ] . Furthermore , rod - like shape nanoparticles are better accepted and tolerated by the organism [ 51 , 52 ] . Specifically , spherical NPs started to be more common than non - spherical NPs due to challenges in synthesis approaches and testing [ 53 ] . Spherical silver nanoparticles ensure anti - inflammatory potential [ 54 ] and promote camptothecin apoptotic activity in cervical cancer [ 55 ] . Despite the advantages offered by silver nanoparticles , progress in spherical gold nanoparticles makes possible their use for combined therapies like drug delivery and photothermy [ 56 ] . There are other significant factors that contribute to a successful therapy devel - opment . Stability and distribution are affected by NPs charge . A positive charge is most effective according to tumor vessels targeting , but a switch to a neutral charge allows NPs to diffuse to the tumor sites [ 57 ] . In order to prolong blood circulation of NPs , their surface can also be modified with specific molecules ( hydrophilic poly - mers / surfactants , biodegradable copolymers such as polyethylene glycol , polox - amine , polyethylene oxide and polysorbate 80 ) , which facilitate cellular uptake into tumor tissue [ 58 , 59 ] . 2 . 4 Classification of NPs Modern nanosystems can enhance drug diagnosis , delivery and also monitor therapeutic responses to the provided drugs [ 60 ] . In order to improve clinical outcomes , researchers tried to synthesize a theranostic platform consisting of multifunctional NPs , which exhibit valuable imaging properties . Therefore , TNPs can be composed of lipids , polymers , metals , carbon and ceramics [ 61 ] . Lipid nanoparticles are widely used in medical field due to their biodegradabil - ity , biocompatibility , low toxicity and high loading capacity for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug molecules [ 62 , 63 ] . Moreover , they can improve the pharma - codynamics and the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic agents based on controlled release profile [ 64 ] . Another important characteristic of lipid NPs is their availabil - ity for functionalization with antibodies , peptides , small molecules or aptamers in order to perform target therapy [ 65 – 67 ] . Polymeric NPs are normally organic - based NPs with a diameter lower than 1 μ m . They can be called nanospheres or nanocapsules depending on their composition [ 68 – 70 ] . These nanoparticles have the ability to improve both the solubility and the bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs [ 71 ] and are intensively used as delivery systems [ 72 , 73 ] . Metallic NPs are designed from metal precursors , including noble metals ( Cu , Ag , and Au ) . The most researched area in biomedical field is represented by gold 7 Theranostic Nanoparticles and Their Spectrum in Cancer DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 88097 NPs , which possess unique optical and electronic characteristics as well as chemical inertness . Also , their availability for surface functionalization [ 74 – 76 ] makes them very useful for a lot of medical applications such as biosensing [ 77 ] , bioimaging [ 78 ] and photothermal therapy [ 79 ] . Silver nanoparticles exhibit unique proper - ties such as thermal conductivity , high electrical conductivity , catalytic activity , chemical stability , antibacterial and improved optical properties [ 80 ] . These NPs are suitable for photonic [ 81 ] , electronic [ 82 ] , antimicrobial and disinfectant applications [ 83 , 84 ] , biosensors [ 85 ] , drug delivery , photothermal therapy [ 26 ] and cellular imaging [ 86 ] . Another class of metallic nanoparticles is represented by semiconductor nano - crystals , which are well known as quantum dots . Many studies report their potential use in biomedical imaging [ 87 ] , drug and gene delivery [ 88 ] and also in diagnosis [ 89 ] based on their unique chemical and optical properties . Magnetic NPs represented by iron oxide NPs possess unique chemical , bio - logical and magnetic characteristics including non - toxicity , chemical stability , biocompatibility , high magnetic susceptibility and high saturation magnetiza - tion [ 90 , 91 ] . The main drawback of iron nanoparticle is that it has a tendency to oxidize [ 13 ] . To eliminate this unwanted process , coating with a biocompatible shell , such as a polymer [ 92 ] , ceramics [ 93 ] or metals [ 13 ] , is needed in order to prevent conglomeration . In addition , iron oxide NPs can be functionalized with proteins , antibodies , enzymes and anticancer drugs [ 13 ] and are investigated for different applications including magnetic hyperthermia [ 94 ] , contrast agents in MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) [ 95 ] , targeted drug delivery [ 96 ] , multimodal imaging and gene therapy [ 61 ] . In the term of carbon - based NPs , fullerenes and carbon nanotubes exhibit promising biomedical applications . Fullerenes are suitable for multiple func - tionalization steps according to their particular globular network structure [ 97 ] . They are widely used as excellent antioxidants [ 98 ] , antiviral agents [ 99 , 100 ] , drug and gene delivery systems [ 101 – 103 ] and photosensitizers for photody - namic therapy [ 104 , 105 ] . On the other hand , elongated design of carbon nano - tubes diagnostic imaging strategies [ 107 – 110 ] , drug delivery [ 111 – 113 ] and also photothermal therapy [ 114 , 115 ] . Ceramics NPs are inorganic non - metallic solids , which are synthesized by heat - ing and successive cooling [ 116 ] . Therefore , these ceramics NPs are intensively used in the research field as photocatalysis , catalysis , agents for photodegradation of dyes and imaging agents [ 117 ] . There are significant challenges in engineering and designing new nanosystems . The “nanoparticle loaded nanoparticle” concept is described as an innovative strat - egy composed of at least two different nanoparticles . For example , porous nanopar - ticles made by silica can encapsulate DNA - conjugated small gold nanoparticles in their pores with great applicability in penetrating tumors [ 118 ] . Hybrid constructs gained increased interest in obtaining programmed nanopar - ticles . DNA nanorobots built of a DNA robot and a DNA aptamer that confers molecular recognition of nucleolin are used for target therapy in cancer [ 119 ] . 3 . Cellular internalization and endosomal escape Once the delivery system comes in the proximity of its target site , the drug must be internalized in order to fulfill its biological effect . While free drugs usually have the ability to pass through cellular membranes and accumulate inside the cell unless they are externalized by efflux pump mechanisms , NPs are internalized differently , mainly through various types of endocytosis [ 120 ] , as presented in Figure 4 . Cancer Nanotechnology 8 Phagocytosis is a mechanism by which specialized cells known as phagocytes recognize and engulf large particles ( ≥ 0 . 5 μ m ) into vesicles called phagosomes [ 121 ] . This process involves actin polymerization and the extension of pseudopods , which surround the opsonized target object [ 122 ] leading to its internalization ( Figure 4 ( 5 ) ) . Phagosomes fuse with early endosomes , followed by late endosomes and then lysosomes , becoming highly acidic and possessing hydrolytic enzymes leading to the degradation of the engulfed object [ 122 ] . Macropinocytosis is a process by which nonselective molecules suspended in extracellular fluid are internalized into the cell , giving rise to endocytic vesicles . Like phagocytosis , it involves cytoskeleton rearrangement beneath the plasma membrane . This leads to a plasma membrane circular ruffle formation that extends and entraps extracellular material , producing a so - called macropinosome [ 123 ] . The maturation of these vesicles involves shrinking while concentrating their contents , migration and digestion or recycling of their contents [ 124 ] . Depending on the cell line , macropinosomes can fuse with lysosomes or directly to the plasma membrane expelling their content to the extracellular space ( Figure 4 ( 4 ) ) [ 124 , 125 ] . Caveolae are small ( 60 – 80 nm ) plasma membrane invaginations , important in processes such as endocytosis , transcytosis , potocytosis and certain signaling pathways [ 126 ] . Caveolin - dependent endocytosis is a triggered , energy - dependent event involved in the uptake of extracellular molecules and membrane components [ 127 ] . It is dependent on actin and dynamin , a GTPase , which is present at the neck of caveolae and is responsible for the release of the caveolar vesicle inside the cytoplasm [ 128 ] . These vesicles deliver the internalized molecules to caveosomes or to early endosomes ( Figure 4 ( 2 ) ) . Caveosomes bypass lysosomes , thus being an important approach for administering easily degradable therapeutic agents [ 129 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis involves the uptake of extracellular molecules through invagination of the plasma membrane . The vesicles are formed when ligands interact with receptors on the plasma membrane , thus recruiting clathrin triskelions and adaptor proteins , which form a multifaceted cage structure [ 130 ] Figure 4 . Cellular internalization through endocytosis . 9 Theranostic Nanoparticles and Their Spectrum in Cancer DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 88097 that is released inside the cell with the help of dynamin . These vesicles are known as clathrin - coated vesicles and can lose their clathrin coat and fuse with early endosomes ( Figure 4 ( 1 ) ) . They are directed towards degradation in lysosomes or recycled to the plasma membrane [ 131 ] . Extracellular cargo can also be internalized via clathrin - and caveolin - indepen - dent pathways ( Figure 4 ( 3 ) ) [ 132 ] . Depending on the internalization mechanism , NPs have different fates . They can face lysosomal degradation when internalized through clathrin - mediated endocytosis while skipping this process when taken up through a caveolin - mediated mechanism [ 133 ] . Many nanomaterials are degraded in endocytic vesicles leading to new approaches of carrier designs that are able to escape the endosomal or lysosomal degradation . Three main strategies , presented in Table 1 , are commonly used to bypass this cellular barrier for drug administration . They rely on molecules , which possess the ability to destabilize the endosomal membrane in a pH - dependent or independent way or to fuse with the endosomal membrane , leading to the release of previously internalized cargo . Another approach involves the photochemical membrane rupture via photothermal nanomaterials . 4 . Diagnosis through molecular imaging mechanisms Molecular imaging is a medical discipline related to medical imaging and is representing the evolution of imaging techniques for diagnosis and therapy moni - toring . It involves cell biology and molecular biology [ 143 ] . Current clinical applications of molecular imaging are CT , SPECT , PET , MRI , US and also hybrid imaging techniques SPECT / CT , PET / CT or PET / MRI . CT , MRI and US provide anatomical information , while PET / CT , and SPECT / CT offer functional and molecular information [ 144 ] . All these techniques are based on the accumula - tion of a contrast agent at the target site [ 145 ] . Strategy Mechanism Examples Ref .

Approaches for endosomal escape . Cancer Nanotechnology 10 Even if they provide high - resolution images from anatomical [ 146 ] to molecular level for further clinical investigations [ 147 – 153 ] , there are some disadvantages regarding the use of them . High doses of radiation and exposure can cause DNA damage in some tissues [ 154 , 155 ] . Also , radiopharmaceutical biodistribution and effectiveness may cause image artifacts and also side effects for the patient [ 156 – 159 ] . Moreover , the patient care quality is not granted in most of the cases [ 156 ] . 4 . 1 NPs involved in diagnosis imaging strategies Diagnostic imaging using NPs refers to the detection of specific disease sites through molecular recognition of tumor cell particularities like the overexpres - sion of several genes and the presence of different cell surface molecules or media excreted compounds / molecules that are involved in various disease processes , microenvironment particularities and also cell development stages [ 160 , 161 ] . Physical properties of nanoparticle systems are very important for molecular imaging applications . Nanoparticle accepted diameters for this application are between 30 and 150 nm . Usually , the nanoparticle surface is modified using a ligand in order to target specific tumor cell molecules . As more ligands are attached on the nanoparticle surface , there are more chances to bind the target cell . The amount of signaling groups influence the sensitivity of the detection method [ 145 ] . Some NPs have innate optical properties like QDs [ 162 ] and metallic NPs due to surface plasmon resonance [ 48 , 163 – 165 ] . QDs nanoparticles labeled with 18 F - Fluoropropionate and functionalized with RGD peptides demonstrate proper optical characteristics for PET imaging of prostate cancer [ 166 ] . Gold nanoparticles proved long circulation time and useful optical properties like high spatial resolution and high sensitivity for CT imaging . By functionaliza - tion with chitosan polymers , they were used for colorectal adenocarcinoma imaging [ 167 ] . Also , they were conjugated with antibodies for lymph nodes and metastases imaging in squamous cell carcinoma , head and neck cancer [ 168 ] . Moreover , gold nanoparticles radiolabeled with 111 In and 125 I can be used in SPECT imaging of epidermoid carcinoma [ 169 ] . Iron oxide nanoparticles are widely used in MRI imaging because they can improve and enhance the contrast [ 170 ] . In glioblastoma , iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with peptides and polymers accumulate within tumor microenvi - ronment by forming self - assembly structures [ 171 ] . Furthermore , polymeric materials such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles carry tumor targeting properties and are proposed for PET imaging in breast cancer . Besides this , they are able to perform drug delivery applications [ 172 ] . Regarding US imaging , perfluorocarbon nanoparticles can be used for a real - time and non - invasive analysis of thyroid carcinoma [ 173 ] . Considering the other nanoparticle formulations ( nanoliposomes , micelles , polymersomes , dendrimers and aptamers ) , these ones need to be functionalized with specific contrast agents and fluorophores . The advantages to implement NPs such as molecular imaging tools are biocompatibility and biodegradability [ 174 ] , encapsulation properties [ 175 ] , water solubility in some cases [ 176 ] and targeting ligands accessibility [ 177 ] . Fluorophores are widely used in diagnosis applications and imaging of cellular processes . One drawback of conventional fluorophores is represented by the loss of fluorescence after a long exposure to light , known as photobleaching . Various processes are known to induce the molecular relaxation without the emission of light , which depends on different chemical or physical factors like temperature , pressure , the presence of organic molecules or polymers and ionic strength , resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity , referred to 11 Theranostic Nanoparticles and Their Spectrum in Cancer DOI : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / intechopen . 88097 as quenching [ 178 ] . Quantifying this decrease in fluorescence emission can give information about the concentration of a specific compound in the proximity of the nano - objects . Lately , numerous diagnostic techniques based on this phenomenon have been introduced [ 179 , 180 ] . On the other hand , another luminogen system based on a process called aggregation - induced emission ( AIE ) , developed by Ben Zhong Tang’s group in 2001 [ 181 ] , gathered increased interest for imaging and theranostic applications . Most luminescent systems have a lower efficiency in an aggregated state , thus limiting the concentration that can be used for imaging purposes and at the same time the achievable intensity of the emitted light . However , in the case of AIEgens , aggregation works constructively becoming highly luminescent in concentrated solutions or in an aggregated state . The utilization of AIEgens in theranostics has lately become a reliable approach , because of several advantages that include good biocompatibility , excellent optical properties and simple preparation and conjugation [ 182 ] . One example implies the conjugation of an AIEgen ( TPS ) with a short peptide ( DEVD ) that is susceptible to caspase - 3 cleavage and that is bound to a prodrug that induces apoptosis [ 183 ] . 5 . Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a form of treatment , which implies the ability of a drug to accumulate at a target site in the body and thus decrease the side effects in healthy cells and tissues . Nanocarriers are often used to improve the bioavailability of the active compounds at the target site and allow the use of significantly reduced concentrations , therefore limiting the exposure of normal cells to the toxic effects of the drugs [ 184 ] . The most common strategies for drug delivery include local drug delivery , pas - sive targeting , physical targeting , magnetic targeting and active targeting [ 185 ] . Local drug delivery is a promising strategy for the treatment of metabolic disor - ders ( diabetes and obesity ) [ 186 ] , periodontitis [ 187 ] and bone disorders [ 188 ] due to its potential to keep drug availability in the target site for a prolonged period of time . Passive targeting is based on enhanced permeability and retention effect ( EPR effect ) present in many tissues [ 189 , 190 ] . Macromolecules and NPs from the bloodstream accumulate preferentially in tumors and inflamed sites , where the permeability of the vasculature is often enhanced . Moreover , the lymphatic drain - age system is damaged in tumors , leading to a prolonged retention of the macromol - ecules and NPs in the tumor interstitium [ 191 ] . Physical targeting depends on the optical , thermal and electrical properties of the carriers [ 192 ] , which can disintegrate at lower pH values or higher temperature and release the free drug . The tumor microenvironment is more acidic compared to the normal surrounding tissues , due to the accumulation of lactate , and therefore pro - vides an opportunity for the use of pH - sensitive nanocarriers in cancer therapy [ 193 ] . Another approach for drug targeting refers to the accumulation of superpara - magnetic carriers in target sites under the action of external magnetic field . Thus , a larger dose of the drug can be released at the tumor site for an increased period of time and side effects of chemotherapy can be diminished [ 194 ] . Once systemically administered , besides the type and intensity of the magnetic field and size of the NPs , many biological factors influence the infiltration of the superparamagnetic carriers to the target site , including the effect of Brownian motion , blood viscosity , interaction of the particles with the red blood cells and blood matrix [ 195 ] . While in the case of passive targeting the physicochemical properties of the nano - carrier system play the major role , active targeting relies on the interaction between the surface of the carrier and antigens expressed on target cells . NPs are functionalized Cancer Nanotechnology 12 by adsorption or chemical conjugation with a large variety of ligand types such as peptides , small molecules , proteins , and aptamers , which present a high specificity for epitopes or receptors that are uniquely expressed or overexpressed on the target sites [ 196 ] . Examples of commonly used ligands and their targets are presented in Table 2 . 6 . Theranostic NPs recently developed Theranostics refers to the use of the nanoparticle for molecular imaging and therapy . Considering the biological barriers , the biocompatibility , easy surface modifications , controlled pharmacokinetics and biodistribution and accommoda - tion in various microenvironment conditions are still necessary to be accomplished [ 211 ] . Polymers are widely used for NP formulations because of biocompatibility and biodegradability properties in vivo [ 212 – 215 ] . Besides coating the nanoparticle surface with polymers , the fluorophores and other contrast probes are widely used to achieve high - sensitivity molecular imaging . There are three main theranostic directions that involve the use of nanoparticles . The first strategy refers to treatment effect evaluation through molecular imaging with NPs as contrast agents . The aim of the second one is to assess a nanoparticle therapeutic strategy with molecular imaging probes . The third one describes nanoparticles as target therapy agents and molecular imaging tools at the same time . In this regard , for the first two procedures , the NP system is either the evaluator or the evaluated component , and for the last strategy , these roles are overlapping . Each one of these roles makes possible the development of future therapies ( Figure 5 ) . The nanoparticles’ evaluator role ( Figure 5 ( 1 ) ) can be emphasized in the next study . Zhang et al . developed Annexin A5 - conjugated polymeric micelles with dual role : detection of apoptosis via SPECT and optical imaging and also therapy outcomes investigation . In this study , the apoptosis was induced by drugs like cyclophospha - mide , etoposide , poly ( L - glutamic acid ) - paclitaxel and cetuximab ( IMC - C225 ) anti - EGFR antibody . The NPs were used to observe the apoptosis - induced processes in lymphoma and breast cancer in vivo . Therefore , SPECT and fluorescence molecular tomography allowed cellular death visualization in tumors [ 216 ] . Class Ligand Targeted biomarker Disease ( clinical trials = * ) Ref .

For example , 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ F - 18 ] fluoro - D - glucose ( 18 F - FDG ) probe is used for metabolic activity measurements via PET / CT imaging . This radiolabeled probe can act as prognostic biomarker for nanoparticle - assisted photothermal therapy monitoring in neuroendocrine lung cancer in vivo [ 217 ] . Another strategy is to ensure both imaging and therapy at the same time ( Figure 5 ( 3 ) ) . In this situation , the nanosystem can be composed of two different components bonded together in order to perform a theranostic action . The easiest way is to make use of the optical properties developed by some materials at nanoscale . Therefore , metallic nanoparticles can scatter and absorb the light in the NIR wavelength domain and are promising tools for cancer photother - mal therapy [ 218 ] . In a different way , nanoparticles can be associated with molecular imaging techniques in order to enhance their efficiency . For example , doxorubicin - loaded polymeric micelles and perfluoropentane stabilized by the same block copolymer can perform US imaging and target therapy for breast and ovarian cancer [ 219 , 220 ] . Some designs suggest the use of two different nanoparticles , which by conjuga - tion with targeting ligands and drug molecules provide tumor visualization and target therapy . For example , quantum dot - mucin 1 aptamer - doxorubicin conjugates were used for ovarian cancer targeting and proved suitable optical properties for imaging and controlled release of the drug [ 221 ] . In addition to the molecular imaging techniques previously described , some nanoparticles can be used for photodynamic and photothermal therapy in order to perform targeting therapy . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) implies the use of photosensitizer agents that under laser irradiation exert cytotoxic activity by generating reactive oxygen species [ 222 , 223 ] . This therapy is very appreciated regarding multidrug resistance cancers and is suppose that it can replace the conventional chemotherapy [ 224 ] . PDT - specific nanoparticles are used as photosensitizer carriers [ 225 , 226 ] . Moreover , these nanocarriers can be functionalized with targeting ligands for better tumor selectivity and also with drug molecules for therapeutic effectiveness [ 227 – 229 ] . Gold nanoparticles loaded with a fluorescent drug Pc4 targeting PSMA - 1 membrane antigen in prostate cancer are promising tools for surgical guidance and further therapeutic intervention [ 228 ] . EGFR - targeted liposomal nanohybrid cerasomes are proposed for PDT and immunotherapy in colorectal cancer due to their sensitive detection properties and anti - tumor efficacy [ 229 ] . By a theranostic point of view , photothermal therapy ( PTT ) , also known as hyperthermia or thermal ablation therapy , acts as a diagnosis and a treatment Figure 5 .

It uses electromagnetic radiation in infrared ( IR ) region and provides high specificity analysis and minimal invasiveness [ 230 ] . The nanocarriers used for PTT need to have the capacity to target the tumor site after heat generation under laser irradiation [ 231 ] . For this purpose , various drug molecules and targeting ligands are encapsulated into nanoparticles . Gold nanoshells targeting HER2 positive breast cancer proved optical contrast and high tissue penetration under NIR irradiation [ 218 ] . Polymer nanoparticles functionalized with IR820 and doxorubicin were used in ovarian cancer and showed prolonged circulation time and drug accumulation at the target site [ 232 ] . It is important to mention that the generated temperature is usually between 42 and 45°C and sometimes higher depending on tumor tissue [ 233 , 234 ] . 6 . 1 Theranostic nanoparticles used in the clinic There are various types of theranostic NPs that can be designed and used for cancer diagnosis and therapy . Their applicability is highlighted by liposomes , which are intensively used in clinical trials due to their specific features . In Table 3 , several theranostic nanoparticles used in clinical ( clinical trials ) and pre - clinical work for cancer diagnosis and therapy are shown . Theranostics has the potential to predict and evaluate therapy response , offer - ing advantageous opportunities to modify the ongoing treatments and to develop new ones even in a personalized manner [ 245 ] . Nanoparticles have gained a lot of confidence in becoming important tools for a lot of medical applications due to their properties [ 17 , 19 ] . The newest designs focus on hybrid nanostructures for better sensitivity and accuracy . These nanohybrids are currently studied and they proved effectiveness in cancer targeting by combining different imaging techniques with drug delivery strategies [ 246 – 248 ] .
