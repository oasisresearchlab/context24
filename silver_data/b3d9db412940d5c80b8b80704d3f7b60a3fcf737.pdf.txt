Concomitantly , epiblast cells transit through distinct pluripotent states 3 , 4 , prior to lineage commitment at gastrulation . These pluripotent states have been characterized at the molecular level 5 , but their biological significance remains unclear . Here , we show that exit from an unrestricted naïve pluripotent state is required for epiblast epithelialization and generation of the pro - amniotic cavity in mouse embryos . Embryonic stem cells locked in the naïve state are able to initiate polarization but fail to undertake lumenogenesis . Mechanistically , exit from naïve pluripotency activates an Oct4 - governed transcriptional program resulting in expression of sialomucins and the vesicle tethering and fusion events of lumenogenesis . Similarly , culture of human embryos beyond implantation reveals that exit from naïve pluripotency triggers amniotic cavity formation and developmental progression . Our results add tissue - level architecture as a new criterion for the characterization of different pluripotent states , and unveil the relevance of transitions between these states during development of the mammalian embryo . We wished to determine the relationship between morphogenesis of the epiblast , meaning its polarization and lumenogenesis , and the transitions between distinct pluripotency states , both of which are initiated upon embryo implantation . When we examined the temporal correlation between these post - implantation events , we found that as the naïve pluripotency factor Nanog became down - regulated 6 , the anti - adhesive sialomucin protein Podocalyxin 7 ( Podxl ) first became polarized apically and then secreted as the lumen appeared ( Fig . 1a ) . Deep - sequencing analysis at successive implantation stages revealed the kinetics of pluripotent transitions . We found that at E4 . 5 and E4 . 75 epiblasts grouped together and expressed naïve pluripotency genes at similar levels , whereas gene expression in the epiblast at E5 . 0 was quite distinct , with the naive pluripotency genes already downregulated ( although Nanog 3 transcription was becoming already low at E4 . 5 - E4 . 75 ; Fig . 1b , c , Extended Data Fig . 1a - g , Supplementary Table 1 ) . When considered together with previous datasets 8 , our findings reveal two distinct groups : pre - implantation ( E3 . 5 - E4 . 75 ) and post - implantation epiblast ( E5 . 0 - E5 . 5 ) , in which naïve genes are downregulated to a similar extent at the latter . We also noted the upregulation of characteristic post - implantation gene expression at E5 . 5 compared to E5 . 0 ( Extended Data Fig . 1h , i ) . Therefore , the naïve gene expression network is dismantled at lumenogenesis . To determine if there is a causal relationship between these events , we cultured E4 . 5 embryos in IVC1 9 supplemented with 2i / LIF ( MEK inhibitor , GSK3 inhibitor and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor , LIF ) , which maintains mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) in the naïve state 10 . We found that 2i / LIF preserved expression of Nanog and inhibited Podxl expression and lumenogenesis ( Fig . 1d - f ) . We confirmed that the naïve state was maintained in ESCs derived from embryos cultured in IVC1 containing 2i / LIF ( Extended Data Fig . 1j , k ) . Embryos in IVC1 containing 2i / LIF did not resume development upon 2i / LIF removal ( Extended Data Fig . 1l - n ) , indicating that the kinetics of naïve pluripotency exit need to be tightly coordinated with morphogenesis . We next examined the kinetics of polarization and lumenogenesis in relation to naïve pluripotency exit using mESCs cultured in matrigel as a model system for embryogenesis 1 ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . Upon 2i / LIF removal and after the first cell division , all polarity markers we examined exhibited polarized localisation . Upon subsequent divisions , mESCs organized into polarized rosettes that opened to form lumens 36 hours after 2i / LIF removal ( Extended Data Fig . 2b - d ) . This coincided with the loss of naïve pluripotency gene expression ( Extended Data Fig . 2e - l ; Supplementary Videos 1 - 3 ) whereas expression of the core pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox2 was maintained . Expression of early post - implantation genes including Otx2 was induced , but primed genes were not expressed ( Extended Data Fig . 2m - q ) as in the E5 . 5 epiblast 4 , 8 . When 2i / LIF was removed before cell plating in matrigel , lumens formed after 24 hours without a rosette ( Extended Data Fig . 3a - c ) , similar to post - implantation - like primed human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) 11 , 12 . 4 To address whether naïve pluripotency exit is required for polarization , we cultured mESCs in matrigel with 2i / LIF ( Fig . 2a ) . Surprisingly , cells displayed polarisation of subcellular components despite the maintenance of Nanog levels ( Fig . 2b - e ; Extended Data Fig . 3d - g ) , and the expression of pluripotency genes was indistinguishable from mESCs cultured in gelatin ( apolar ) ( Extended Data Fig . 2g - o , 3h - m ) . Moreover , mESCs recovered from matrigel lost their polarized organization , grew as canonical mESCs and contributed to post - implantation development in chimeras , indicating that their naïve state was intact ( Fig . 2f - h ; Extended Data Fig . 3n - p ) . As expected 13 , mESCs cultured without 2i / LIF progressively lost the ability to generate colonies ( Fig . 2g ) . In accord with the above results , Dgcr8 KO mESCs , which are blocked in the naïve state 14 , underwent polarization ; moreover , preservation of naïve pluripotency with a PKC inhibitor 15 did not impair polarization ( Fig . 2i , j ; Extended Data Fig . 3q - v ) . Therefore , mESCs can reversibly initiate polarization without losing their naïve character . By the time mESCs cultured without 2i / LIF formed lumens , mESCs cultured with 2i / LIF remained as closed rosettes and expressed the naïve markers Nanog and Rex1 , while Oct4 was expressed at similar levels in both conditions ( Fig . 3a - b ; Extended Data Fig . 4a - c ) . Electron microscopy revealed that while mESCs formed expanded lumens in the absence of 2i / LIF , mESCs cultured with 2i / LIF displayed either no , or only rudimentary , lumens despite having apically localized tight juntions ( TJs ) and Golgi ( Extended Data Fig . 4d , e ) . With time , rosettes of mESCs in 2i / LIF lost polarization and became disorganized ( Fig . 3c - d ; Extended Data Fig . 4f - h ) . As we observed in embryos , mESCs cultured in matrigel containing 2i / LIF did not resume morphogenesis upon 2i / LIF removal ( Extended Data Fig . 4i - l ) . To test whether the lumenogenesis defect was a direct consequence of the pluripotent status , we cultured mESCs with combinations of two supplements ( 2i , MEKi / LIF and GSK3i / LIF ) sufficient to maintain naïve pluripotency 16 . All combinations inhibited lumenogenesis and preserved Nanog expression ( Extended Data Fig . 4m - o ) . Given a single supplement , mESCs 5 forming lumens showed decreased Nanog expression ( Extended Data Fig . 4p , q ) . Dgcr8 KO mESCs expressing high Nanog levels also showed a lumenogenesis defect ( Fig . 3e - g ; Extended Data Fig . 5a - d ) . Likewise , PKC inhibition preserved Rex1 and Nanog expression , and impaired lumenogenesis ( Extended Data Fig . 5e - h ) . Notably , when we first induced naïve pluripotency exit and then cultured cells in matrigel containing 2i / LIF , those cells expressing Podxl but lacking Nanog formed lumens ( Extended Data Fig . 5i - m ) . Next , we sought to identify the transcription factors that regulate lumenogenesis . Constitutive expression of Nanog enhances self - renewal 17 . However , we found that Nanog overexpression in the absence of 2i / LIF and serum was insufficient to block lumenogenesis and to preserve the naïve network ( Extended Data Fig . 5n - r ) . Similarly , Nanog downregulation was insufficient to promote lumenogenesis with 2i / LIF , and Rex1 levels remained constant ( Extended Data Fig . 5s - v ) . We next focused on Oct4 as , together with Otx2 , drives enhancer activation upon naïve pluripotency exit 18 , 19 . Decreasing Oct4 expression led to defective lumenogenesis and reduced Otx2 levels ( Fig . 3h - i ; Extended Data Fig . 5w , x ) . These results indicate that the pluripotency network directs lumen formation and epithelialization via Oct4 . For further mechanistic insight , we tested whether the fusion of apical vesicles 20 mediates lumenogenesis . Cells expressing a dominant - negative form of Rab11a ( Rab11aS25N ) 21 failed to form lumens ( Fig . 4a - b ) . Apical vesicles carry components involved in lumenogenesis , such as Podxl 22 . Since Podxl was not expressed in naïve conditions ( Fig . 1a ; Extended Data Fig . 6a - d ) , we evaluated its role in lumenogenesis by RNAi . mESCs lacking Podxl showed a lumen formation defect at 48 hours , without alterations in naïve pluripotency exit or polarization ( Extended Data Fig . 6e - k ) . To determine the long - term consequences of Podxl deficiency , we generated Podxl KO mESCs . Podxl KO mESCs showed defective lumenogenesis after 48 hours , but formed lumens by 72 hours ( Fig . 4c - d ; Extended Data Fig . 6l - m ) , in agreement with the lack of lethality in Podxl KO embryos 23 . This lumenogenesis delay was rescued by overexpressing Cd34 , a sialomucin expressed at very low levels at E5 . 5 8 ( Extended Data Fig . 6n , p ) . Moreover , treatment with protamine sulfate , which 6 neutralises the negative charges of sialomucins 24 , blocked lumen formation at 72 hours ( Fig . 4e - f ) , indicating that sialomucins mediate lumenogenesis via cell repulsion . Next , we analyzed whether Podxl expression was regulated by Oct4 - Otx2 . We found that Otx2 KO mESCs expressed low levels of Podxl and displayed a lumenogenesis delay ( Extended Data Fig . 7a - d ) , which was rescued by Otx2 overexpression using a doxycycline ( DOX ) inducible system ( Extended Data Fig . 7e - f ) . In agreement with previous results 6 , 18 , Otx2 overexpression in the presence of 2i / LIF was able to induce naïve pluripotency exit in 50 % of WT and 35 % of Otx2 KO mESCs . These cells formed lumens despite the presence of 2i / LIF ( Extended Data Fig . 7g - j ) . Although Otx2 KO mESCs showed a delay in naïve pluripotency exit , the lumenogenesis defect was rescued by over - expression of GFP - Podxl ( Extended Data Fig . 7k - m ) . Analysis of Oct4 and Otx2 Chip - seq data 18 revealed the presence of an intronic enhancer approximately 3 . 5Kbs downstream of the Podxl transcription start site . In naïve conditions this enhancer was bound by Oct4 and devoid of the activating H3K27ac mark . Naïve pluripotency exit led to Otx2 binding and increased H3K27ac ( Extended Data Fig . 7n ) . However , Podxl overexpression was insufficient to rescue lumen formation in naïve cells ; instead the exogenous Podxl co - localized with Rab11 ( Fig . 4g ; Extended Data Fig . 7o , p ) . Analysis of the expression of genes involved in the fusion of Podxl - containing vesicles 25 in E4 . 5 - E5 . 5 epiblasts 8 revealed that the TJ protein Cingulin ( Cgn ) was induced upon naïve pluripotency exit . We confirmed this in embryos and mESCs ( Fig . 4h ; Extended Data Fig . 8a - b ) . In MDCK cells Cgn mediates lumenogenesis by tethering Rab11 vesicles through association with the Rab11 interacting protein Fip5 26 . Indeed , we found that Fip5 showed polarized localisation and associated with Podxl upon 2i / LIF removal ( Extended Data Fig . 8c ) . Depletion of Cgn led to a lumenogenesis defect and accumulation of Podxl in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4i - j ) , without affecting naïve pluripotency exit ( Extended Data Fig . 8d - e ) . Thus , in mESCs Cgn mediates the apical fusion of Podxl - containing Rab11 vesicles . The human epiblast also transforms into an epithelium enclosing a lumen ( amniotic cavity ) at implantation 2 . However , whether this occurs concomitant with a pluripotency change remains 7 unknown . We found that at E6 - 7 , epiblast cells ( GATA6 - ) expressed the naïve factor KLF17 27 and lacked PODXL , whereas 4 out of 9 human embryos cultured until E9 - 10 11 , 28 , had a PODXL - coated lumen ( Fig . 5a - b ) . Upon addition of inhibitors and growth factors ( 5i / LAF ) that preserve naïve pluripotency in hESCs 29 , embryos failed to form a lumen , displayed high levels of KLF17 , NANOG and the naïve marker CD130 30 , and showed a mild increase in apoptosis ( Fig . 5b - e ; Extended Data Fig . 9a - f ) . Finally , we determined the tissue - level characteristics of distinctive human pluripotent states in different naïve cultures . hESCs overexpressing NANOG and KLF2 with 2i / LIF are in a naïve - like state 29 , 31 . We found that presence of DOX upregulated naïve markers and abolished lumenogenesis , whereas DOX removal or switching to primed conditions induced naïve pluripotency exit and lumenogenesis ( Extended Data Fig . 10a - e ) . In transgene - independent naïve conditions ( RSet and 5i / LAF 29 ) we found that although NANOG and KLF2 were downregulated , naïve markers were highly expressed and lumenogenesis was abolished without alterations in the initial polarization ( Fig . 5f , g ; Extended Data Fig . 10f - m ) . Switching to primed conditions led to both rosette and lumen formation ( Extended Data Fig . 10n , o ) . Therefore , in human embryos and hESCs a pluripotent transition is required for amniotic cavity formation . Our data thus indicates an evolutionary conserved mechanism that unifies transcriptional and architectural changes of the epiblast . Failure to exit from naïve pluripotency leads to impaired cavity formation and this in turn could contribute to high rates of embryo loss at implantation . Author contributions M . N .

Informed consent was obtained from all participants , who were informed about the conditions and regulations that apply within the HFEA code of practice . The project has also a local approval by a Research Ethics Committee ( UK National Health Service Research Ethics Committee reference 06 / Q0702 / 90 ) . All experimental work conformed to the principles of the WMA Declaration of Helsinki . All experimental work was performed under the HFEA Codes of Practice and the HFEA Act 1990 practices . Slow - frozen human embryos ( day 5 - 6 ) were thawed using Quinn’s Advantage Thaw Kit ( ART - 8016 , LifeGlobal Group ) , and vitrified human embryos ( day 5 - 6 ) were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Solutions ( VT802 - 0 , Hunter Scientific ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Embryos were cultured in Human embryo culture media SAGE 1 - Step ( 67010060A , LifeGlobal Group ) for 24 hours before Zona pellucida removal with Acidic Tyrode’s solution ( T1788 , Sigma ) . Embryos were washed in SAGE 1 - Step medium and subsequently cultured in a pre - to post - implantation culture method 11 , as previously described . Briefly , embryos were plated in IbiTreat µ - plates ( IB - 80826 , Ibidi GmbH ) in IVC1 ( control ) or IVC1 supplemented with 5i / LAF and cultured at 37°C in 21 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 . 24 hours after plating half of the medium was replaced with fresh IVC1 . 48 hours after plating half of the medium was replaced with fresh IVC2 . 72 hours after plating embryos were fixed with 4 % PFA ( 15710 , Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . The exact composition of the medium was as follows : IVC1 medium : Advanced DMEM / F12 ( 12634010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 20 % v / v heat - inactivated FBS ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , GlutaMAX ( 35050061 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 25 units / ml Penicillin / 25 µg / ml Streptomycin ( 15140122 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 1X ITS - X ( 10 mg / ml insulin , 5 . 5 mg / L transferrin , 0 . 0067 mg / L sodium selenite , 2 mg / L etholamine ) ( 51500056 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 8 nM β - estradiol ( E8875 , Sigma ) , 200 ng / ml Progesterone ( P0130 , Sigma ) , and 25 µM N - aceyl - L - cysteine ( A7250 , Sigma ) . IVC2 medium : 20 % FBS is substituted for 30 % KnockOut Serum Replacement ( 10828010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . 5i / LAF : IVC1 and IVC2 were supplemented with 20 ng / mL recombinant human LIF ( 300 - 05 , PeproTech ) , 20 ng / mL Activin - A ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 8 ng / mL bFGF2 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 1 µM MEK inhibitor PD0325901 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 0 . 5 µM GSK3 inhibitor IM - 12 ( BML - WN102 - 0005 , Enzo Life Sciences ) , 0 . 5 µM RAF inhibitor SB - 590885 ( S0459 , LKT Labs ) , 1 µM Src inhibitor WH - 4 - 023 ( 5413 , Tocris ) and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 . Embryos that attached to the plates and preserved the epiblast lineage were considered for statistical analyses . From a total of 87 embryos thawed , 8 were fixed at the blastocyst stage ( Fig . 5a ) . Out of these 8 embryos , 4 had epiblast cells as determined by immunofluorescence . The remaining 79 human embryos were cultured in the IVC system . Out of these 79 embryos , 34 survived the thawing procedure , attached to the plates and survived in the in vitro culture system . Out of these 34 , the epiblast lineage was preserved in 21 embryos ( Fig . 5 and Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . Mouse embryos : Mice were kept in the Animal House in accordance with national and international guidelines . All experiments have been regulated by the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body ( AWERB ) . were approved by the Home Office . Animals were inspected daily and those that showed health concerns were culled by cervical dislocation . Mouse embryos were recovered at embryonic days E4 . 5 ( 9am ) and E4 . 75 ( 4pm ) from naturally mated F1 ( C57Bl6xCBA ) or MF1 females by flushing the uterus with M2 medium . Embryos recovered at E5 . 0 ( 12pm ) and E5 . 5 were manually dissected from the decidua . Females for natural matings were used at 3 ± 1 month of age . For mESC - embryo chimera experiments embryos were obtained from F1 females superovulated by injection of 7 . 5 IU of pregnant mares’ serum gonadotropin ( PMSG , Intervet ) , followed by injection of 7 . 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG , Intervet ) and mating with F1 males . Chimeric embryos were transferred to F1 females mated with vasectomized CD1 males . Superovulated females were used at 6 ± 1 week of age . To culture embryos through the pre - to post - implantation transition , the mural trophectoderm of E4 . 5 mouse embryos was removed as previously described 9 . Embryos were subsequently plated in 8 well µ - Slides ( 80826 , Ibidi ) for 24 hours in IVC1 medium . 14 Epiblast dissection at peri - implantation stages : CAG - GFP expressing mouse embryos 32 were recovered at E4 . 5 , E4 . 75 and E5 . 0 . The mural trophectoderm ( E4 . 5 and E4 . 75 embryos ) and the extraembryonic ectoderm ( E5 . 0 embryos ) were removed with a finely pulled glass pipette . Embryos were then treated for 15 min at 4°C with Cell Dissociation Buffer ( enzyme - free ) ( 13150016 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) followed by pipetting with a narrow glass pipette . This treatment removed most of the primitive endoderm / visceral endoderm and polar trophectoderm cells . If remaining GFP - negative cells were observed , these were separated with a finely pulled glass pipette . mESC culture : mESCs were routinely cultured in gelatin - coated plates in N2B27 - 2i - LIF at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 21 % O 2 . N2B27 medium comprised a 1 / 1 mix of DMEM / F12 ( 21331 - 020 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) and Neurobasal A ( 10888 - 022 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) supplemented with 1 % v / v B - 27 ( 10889 - 038 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 0 . 5 % v / v N - 2 ( homemade ) , 100 µM β - mercaptoethanol ( 31350 - 010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , Penicillin - Streptomycin ( 15140122 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) and GlutaMAX ( 35050061 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . N - 2 supplement contained DMEM / F12 medium ( 21331 - 020 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 2 . 5 mg / mL Insulin ( I9287 , Sigma ) , 10 mg / mL Apo - transferrin ( T1147 , Sigma ) , 0 . 75 % Bovine Albumin Fraction V ( 15260037 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 20 µg / mL Progesterone ( p8783 , Sigma ) , 1 . 6 mg / mL Putrescine dihydrochloride ( P5780 , Sigma ) and 6 µg / mL Sodium selenite ( S5261 , Sigma ) . 2i - LIF ( 1 µM MEK inhibitor PD0325901 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 3 µM GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , and 10 ng / mL LIF ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) ) was added to N2B27 medium to preserve naïve pluripotency . Exit from naïve pluripotency was triggered by removal of 2i - LIF . Where indicated , mESCs were cultured for a minimum of 4 passages using different combinations of inhibitors ( MEKi - LIF , GSK3i - LIF , MEKi - GSK3i ( 2i ) ) . Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR . As an alternative way to preserve naïve pluripotency , mESCs were cultured on Mitomycin C ( M4287 , Sigma ) - treated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs ) in Fc medium supplemented with 5 µM Gö6983 ( G1918 , Sigma ) . Fc medium contained DMEM ( 41966 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 15 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , Penicillin - Streptomycin ( 15140122 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , GlutaMAX ( 35050061 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , MEM Non - Essential Amino Acids ( 11140035 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , Sodium Pyruvate ( 11360070 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) and 100 µM β - mercaptoethanol ( 31350 - 010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Cells were routinely passaged with Trypsin EDTA ( 25300054 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Fc medium was subsequently added to neutralize the trypsin and cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes . The following mESC lines were used : E14 WT mESCs ( kindly provided by Prof . Austin Smith , Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge , UK ) , 129 WT mESCs ( kindly provided by Dr . Jacob Hanna , Weizmann Institute of Science , Israel ) , Δ PE - Oct3 / 4 - GFP mESCs 33 ( kindly provided by Prof .

Konrad Hochedlinger , Harvard Stem Cell Institute , Boston , US ) . mESC - embryo chimeras : Chimeras were generated by aggregation of H2B - GFP expressing mESCs with 8 - cell stage mouse embryos . Briefly , 4 - cell stage embryos were recovered by flushing the oviducts with M2 medium . Embryos were cultured in KSOM medium ( MR - 020P - 5F , Millipore ) until the 8 - cell stage , at which point zona pellucida was removed by brief treatment with Acidic Tyrode’s solution ( T1788 , Sigma ) . H2B - GFP expressing mESCs were cultured in 3D matrigel for 24 or 72 hours . To obtain a single cell suspension , the 3D cultures were treated with Cell Recovery Solution ( 354253 , Corning ) for 15 min at 4°C . The matrigel was broken into small pieces with a scrapper , the resulting suspension was centrifuged and the cell pellet was gently resuspended in Trypsin EDTA ( 25300054 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . After trypsin inactivation , cells were plated in gelatin - coated plates . The resulting ESC colonies were gently dissociated into small clumps and aggregated with the 8 - cell embryos in M2 medium . The resulting chimeras were cultured in KSOM medium until E3 . 5 , when they were transferred into pseudo - pregnant females . Chimeras were recovered at E6 . 5 . mESC derivation : For Nanog - YFP mESC derivation , 8 - cell stage mouse embryos were recovered from the oviducts of pregnant females and cultured in KSOM ( MR - 020P - 5F , Millipore ) in the presence of 2i . 24 h later , the medium was changed to N2B27 - 2i - LIF for 48 h . Hatched blastocysts were 15 subsequently plated on Mitomycin C - treated MEFs in Fc medium containing 2i - LIF . 2 days later , blastocysts outgrowths were trypsinized and plated to obtain mESC colonies . Positive colonies were identified by immunofluorescence and PCR using two different sets of primers : Nanog - YFP PCR1 FW1 : AGCCTTGGAATGCTGCTCCGC Nanog - YFP PCR1 RV1 : CAATTAGAGCTATGCAGAGAA Nanog - YFP PCR1 RV2 : CCACCCCGGTGAACAGCTCC Nanog - YFP PCR2 FW1 : AGCCTTGGAATGCTGCTCCGC Nanog - YFP PCR2 RV1 : CTGGTCTGCAGAGCTAGTTC Nanog - YFP PCR2 RV2 : CCACCCCGGTGAACAGCTCC For derivation of mESCs from implantation cultures , 24 hours after culture in IVC1 or IVC1 + 2iLIF embryos were plated on Mitomycin C – treated MEFs in Fc medium containing 2i - LIF . 2 days later the outgrowths were trypsinized and re - plated , and the appearance of dome - shaped mESC colonies was monitored . hESC culture : All hESC experiments were approved by the UK Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee and comply with the regulations of the UK Code of Practice for the Use of Human Stem Cell Lines . The WIBR3 Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP dox - inducible NANOG KLF2 hESC line 29 ( kindly provided by Prof . Rudolf Jaenisch , MIT , Boston US ) was routinely cultured in irradiated CF - 1 MEFs ( GSC - 6101G , Amsbio ) in N2B27 - 2i - hLIF - dox at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 21 % O 2 . N2B27 medium comprised a 1 / 1 mix of DMEM / F12 ( 21331 - 020 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) and Neurobasal A ( 10888 - 022 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) supplemented with 2 % v / v B - 27 ( 10889 - 038 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 1 % v / v N - 2 ( 17502048 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 100 µM β - mercaptoethanol ( 31350 - 010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , Penicillin - Streptomycin ( 15140122 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , GlutaMAX ( 35050061 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , MEM Non - Essential Amino Acids ( 11140035 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 50 µg / mL BSA ( A3311 , Sigma ) and 0 . 5 % v / v KnockOut Serum Replacement ( 10828010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . To preserve naïve pluripotency 2i - hLIF - dox was added to the medium ( 1 µM MEK inhibitor PD0325901 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 3 µM GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 20 ng / mL recombinant human LIF ( 300 - 05 , PeproTech ) and 1 µg / mL doxycycline hyclate ( D9891 , Sigma ) . Cells were routinely passaged once / twice per week by treatment with StemPro Accutase reagent ( A1110501 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 3 min , followed by addition of Fc medium and centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 rpm . Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR . To convert naïve hESCs to primed conditions , two days after plating the medium was changed to DMEM / F12 ( 21331 - 020 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) supplemented with 15 % FBS ( 10082139 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 5 % KnockOut Serum Replacement ( 10828010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , GlutaMAX ( 35050061 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , MEM Non - Essential Amino Acids ( 11140035 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , Penicillin - Streptomycin ( 15140122 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 100 µM β - mercaptoethanol ( 31350 - 010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) and 4 ng / mL bFGF2 ( Stem Cell Insitute , Cambridge ) . 4 to 5 days later , and when clear primed colonies were identified , cells were passaged using Collagenase / dispase ( 000000010269638001 , Sigma ) for 15 min , followed by addition of Fc medium , centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 rpm and plating in the presence of 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 72304 , Stemcell Technologies ) for 24 h . Primed hESCs were switched to a MEF - independent culture by using geltrex ( A1569601 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) - coated plates and mTESR1 medium ( 05850 , Stemcell Technologies ) . Primed hESCs cultured in mTESR1 were routinely passaged using StemPro Accutase reagent ( A1110501 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . During the first 24 h after passaging 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 72304 , Stemcell Technologies ) was added to the medium . Naïve WIBR3 Δ PE - OCT4 - GFP dox - inducible NANOG KLF2 hESCs were plated on CF - 1 MEFs and two days after plating the medium was switched to transgene independent naïve hESC media . Two different formulations were used : - 5i / LAF 29 : N2B27 medium was supplemented with 20 ng / mL recombinant human LIF ( 300 - 05 , PeproTech ) , 20 ng / mL Activin - A ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 8 ng / mL bFGF2 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 1 µM MEK inhibitor PD0325901 ( Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge ) , 0 . 5 µM GSK3 inhibitor IM - 12 ( BML - WN102 - 0005 , Enzo Life Sciences ) , 0 . 5 µM RAF inhibitor SB - 590885 ( S0459 , LKT Labs ) , 1 µM Src inhibitor WH - 4 - 023 ( 5413 , Tocris ) and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 . - RSet medium ( 05970 , Stemcell Technologies ) . Transgene - independent hESCs were routinely cultured on CF - 1 MEFs ( GSC - 6101G , Amsbio ) and passaged using StemPro Accutase reagent ( A1110501 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . 16 mESC spheroid formation : to induce polarization and lumenogenesis of mESCs we used matrigel , as it can mimic in vitro the basement membrane that surrounds the epiblast at implantation in vivo 1 . Two different protocols were used 36 : - Embedded : pellets containing 20000 mESCs were resuspended in 20 µL of ice - cold Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel ( 356230 , BD Biosciences ) . The solution was placed as a drop in a well of a µ - Slide 8 well ibiTreat ( IB - 80826 , Ibidi ) and incubated for 2 min at 37°C to allow the matrigel to solidify . Next , 300 µL of medium ( N2B27 or Fc depending on the experiment ) were added to the well . - 3D on top : a well of a µ - Slide 8 well ibiTreat ( IB - 80826 , Ibidi ) was covered with 35 µL of ice cold Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel ( 356230 , BD Biosciences ) and incubated for 2 min at 37°C to allow the matrigel to solidify . In the meantime , 20000 mESCs were resuspended in N2B27 and the cell suspension was carefully plated on the matrigel - coated well . When approximately 80 % of the cells had attached to the matrigel ( 5 - 10 min after plating ) the medium was removed and replaced with N2B27 containing 5 % matrigel . Where indicated mESCs were treated with 50 µg / mL of protamine sulfate ( 1101230005 , Merck Millipore ) hESC spheroid formation : hESCs were induced to polarize and form lumens using the 3D on top protocol as previously described 11 . Briefly , a single cell suspension of hESCs was plated on matrigel - coated µ - Slide 8 well ibiTreat ( IB - 80826 , Ibidi ) as detailed above . Upon attachment to the matrigel - coated surface , the medium was replaced with hESC medium ( mTESR or naïve hESC medium depending on the experiment ) containing 5 % matrigel . To avoid single cell - induced primed hESC death 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 72304 , Stemcell Technologies ) was added to the medium for 24 h . To monitor de dynamics of naïve pluripotency exit and morphogenesis , naïve hESCs were plated in 3D matrigel in mTESR medium . siRNA treatments : mESCs were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent ( 13778030 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) using a reverse transfection protocol . Briefly , 100000 cells were plated on gelatin - coated 12 well plates together with the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX - siRNA mix . 0 . 5 µL of a 20 µM siRNA solution were used per well .

Single cells were subsequently plated on 96 well plates with Mitomycin C ( M4287 , Sigma ) - treated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs ) in Fc - 2i / LIF medium . Efficient gene editing was assayed by PCR using the following primers : Podxl Delta FW : ACACCTTCGCTCGTCGCTGC Podxl Delta RV : GACTAGGAATAAATCCACGATCTGGCC which generated a 485bp WT band and a 200bp KO band . Three KO clones were selected for further analyses by RT - PCR ( data not shown ) and immunofluorescence . 18 mESC transfection : mESCs were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( L3000001 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , the day before transfection 50000 cells were plated on 24 well gelatin - coated plates in N2B27 - 2i - LIF without antibiotics . For transfection 0 . 5 µg of a PiggyBac transposon vector ( kind gift of Dr . Jose Silva , Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge , UK ) and 0 . 5 µg of either GFP - Podxl - pHygro , GFP - Cd34 - pBlasticidin , tetO - Otx2 - puro 18 , H2B - GFP - pHygro , GFP - Rab11a - pHygro or GFP - Rab11aS25N - pHygro were used . Transfected cells were selected with 200 µg / mL of Hygromycin B ( 10687010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 10 µg / mL of Blasticidin ( R210 - 01 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) or 2 µg / mL of Puromycin ( ant - pr - 1 , Invivogen ) and the resulting colonies were manually picked and expanded . Immunofluorescence : Cells and embryos were fixed in 4 % PBS / paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) ( 15710 , Electron Microscopy Sciences ) for 20 min at RT and subsequently washed twice with 0 . 1 % Tween / PBS . To stain centrosomes , cells and embryos were fixed in ice - cold methanol for 5 min at 4°C . Peremeabilization was done in PBS containing 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 1 M glycine for 30 min at RT . Cells were incubated with primary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 2 ) at 4°C ON , followed by incubation with fluorescently - conjugated Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 2 h at RT ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % Tween / PBS . Images were acquired in an inverted SP5 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) with a Leica HC PL APO 1 . 4 NA 63X oil objective or in an inverted SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) with a Leica HC PL APO CS2 1 . 4 NA 63x oil objective . Time - lapse microscopy : Time - lapse images of mESCs were acquired in an inverted SP5 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) with a Leica HC PL FLUOTAR 0 . 5 NA 20 . 0X dry objective . Cells were imaged in a humidified chamber with 21 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . Images were taken at intervals of 30 min with a Z step of 4 µm . Fixation and staining for serial block face imaging : Samples were fixed by immersion with 2 % formaldehyde ( made from PFA ) and 2 % vacuum distilled glutaraldehyde , containing 2mmol / L CaCl2 , in 0 . 05M sodium cacodylate buffer at 4°C and pH 7 . 4 for 8 hours at 4°C . They were rinsed for 5 x 3 minutes in cold cacodylate buffer containing 2mM calcium chloride . After buffer washes , they were incubated in 1 % osmium ferricyanide for 18 hours at 4°C and rinsed 5 times in Distilled - Deionized Water ( DIW ) . This was followed by 30 minutes incubation in 1 % thiocarbohydrazide at room temperature and 5 more rinses in DIW . Samples were then incubated in 1 % uranyl acetate in 0 . 05 maleate buffer at pH 5 . 5 and at 4°C for 48 hours . They were again rinsed with DIW at room temperature 5 x 3 minutes , and dehydrated through 2 times each of 50 % , 70 % , 90 % , and 100 % ethanol , dry ethanol , dry acetone and dry acetonitrile . The dehydrated samples were infiltrated with Quetol 651 epoxy resin over a period of 5 days . The resin was cured for 48 hours at 65°C . Thin sections were prepared with a Leica Ultracut S mounted on 200 mesh copper grids and viewed with a Tecnia G2 operated at 200kV . Image analysis : All microscopy data were analyzed using Fiji software 38 ( http : / / fiji . sc ) . For 3D reconstructions images were cropped and filter in Fiji and the rendering was done using Chimera ( v . 1 . 8 . 1 ) ( https : / / www . cgl . ucsf . edu / chimera / ) . For all quantifications , laser power and detector gain were maintained constant to quantitatively compare different experimental conditions within a single experiment - Quantification of nuclear fluorescence intensity in ESCs : DAPI images were binarized and a mask was created to segment in 2D the nuclei . These were saved as Regions Of Interest ( ROIs ) , which were used to delineate nuclei in the channel of interest , and nuclear fluorescence intensity was measured within each ROI . For every ESC spheroid a unique averaged fluorescence intensity value was generated . Error bars represent the variability ( s . e . m . ) across different spheroids from different independent experiments . To compare fluorescence intensity values across different experiments , raw fluorescence intensity values were normalized to the average fluorescence intensity of the corresponding 2iLIF experimental condition . Using this approach , mESCs were considered to be negative for Oct4 ( in the Oct4 siRNA group ) or negative for Nanog ( in the Nanog siRNA group ) when the average fluorescence of the spheroid was below the 25 % percentile of the corresponding control group . - Quantification of Podxl and Cgn : to determine whether a spheroid was negative for Podxl ( in the Podxl siRNA group ) or negative for Cgn ( in the Cgn siRNA group ) the Podxl or Cgn channels in the 19 control group were used to set a threshold value of intensity . This treshold was applied to the experimental group and the images were binarized . mESC spheroids that did not show any signal based on the threshold value of intensity were considered to be negative . - Quantification of nuclear fluorescence intensity in embryos : a representative Z plane was chosen for every embryo and the fluorescence intensity of epiblast pluripotency genes was measured using the DAPI channel to segment the nuclei as mentioned above . To account for changes in fluorescence in the Z - axis , the fluorescence intensity of the gene of interest in the epiblast was normalized to the fluorescence intensity of DAPI in the epiblast . Error bars represent the variability ( s . e . m . ) across different embryos . - Quantification of fluorescence intensity in time - lapse experiments : to quantify the dynamics of naïve pluripotency gene expression , the brightfield channel was used to create a mask , and applied to the channel of interest as mentioned above . For every time step a single fluorescence value corresponding to the average population was measured . Error bars represent the variability ( s . e . m . ) across different fields of view . To account for photobleaching during imaging in Extended Data Fig . 2e the raw fluorescence intensity values of the - 2i / LIF experimental group were normalized to the raw fluorescence intensity values of the 2i / LIF control group ( Extended Data Fig . 3k - m ) throughout the time lapse . All experimental conditions shown in Extended Data Fig . 2e and Extended Data Fig . 3k - m were imaged simultaneously . - Analysis of centrosome positions : to analyze the position of centrosomes the nucleus - nucleus axis and the nucleus - centrosome axis were determined . The angle between both vectors was calculated and the XY positions were normalized to the internuclear distance . - Analysis of lumen and rosette formation : to quantitatively determine whether rosettes and lumens form in embryos and ESC spheroids we immunostained components of the Par polarity complex ( either aPKC or Par6 ) and / or Podxl , as they are known to localize to the lumen in 3D in vitro cultures 20 and are used as bona - fide luminal markers in different model systems 39 , 40 . Phalloidin staining was used to reveal cell shapes . Lumens and rosettes displayed a polarized organization , whereas disorganized structures did not show a polarized localization of Par proteins and / or Podxl . In addition , the fluorescence intensity profile was plotted from a line drawn through the location of interest ( rosettes or lumens ) . One peak of fluorescence intensity corresponds to a rosette ( a closed spot of fluorescence ) whereas two peaks depict a lumen ( two walls and a central depression ) ( Fig . 1a , Fig . 5d and Extended Data Fig . 2b are shown as examples ) . In Extended Data Fig . 9a the F - actin channel was separated from the nanog channel by applying a subtract function in Fiji . RNA extraction and RT - PCR : For RNA extraction of mESCs cultured in matrigel ( 3D on top protocol ) , the matrigel was first removed by treatment with Cell Recovery Solution ( 354253 , Corning ) for 15 min at 4°C . To facilitate the depolimerization , the matrigel was manually broken into small pieces . Cells were subsequently centrifuged and pellets were washed once with PBS . RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent ( 15596010 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . 1 µg of RNA was used to perform a reverse transcriptase reaction in the presence of random primers ( C1181 , Promega ) , dNTPs ( N0447S , New England BioLabs ) , RNAse inhibitor ( M0314L , New England BioLabs ) and M - MuLV reverse transcriptase ( M0253L , New England BioLabs ) . RT - PCR reactions were carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( 4368708 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) in a Step One Plus Real - Time PCR machiner ( Applied Biosystems ) . The following program was used : 10 min 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec 95°C ( denaturing ) and 1 min 60°C ( annealing and extension ) . The primers used are listed on Supplementary Table 3 . Mouse gene expression data were normalized to gapdh , and human gene expression data were normalized to HPRT . Error bars represent variability ( s . e . m . ) across multiple independent experiments . Library preparation , RNA sequencing and mapping of reads The SMARTSeq2 protocol 41 was used to amplify mRNA with the addition of ERCC spike - in control ( 1 µ l of 1 : 1 , 000 , 000 dilution of mix 1 ( 4456740 , Ambion ) per sample ) . Nextera XT ( Illumina ) was used to generate multiplex sequencing libraries from amplified cDNA . Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 running in rapid mode . The paired - end reads were then mapped to both the M . musculus genome ( Ensembl v . 38 . 77 ) as well as to ERCC sequences using the default settings on GSNAP ( v . 2014 - 10 - 07 ) . Htseq - count 42 ( v . 0 . 6 . 1p1 default options ) was used to count the number of reads mapped to each gene . All the samples were analysed in a single experiment to avoid batch effects . 20 Sample quality assessment Three metrics were used to assess data quality : the fraction of reads that were mapped , the number of genes that had more than 10 reads per million ( RPM ) as well as the fraction of reads that were mapped to mitochondrial genes . Extended Data Fig . 1b - e displays these metrics , with each being shown as a function of the total read number per sample . A principal component analysis was run and outliers were defined as performing worse than average on all three of these metrics ( Extended Data Fig . 1f ) . These analyses uncovered one clear outlier ( sample name ‘‘E4 . 5 _ Sample1’’ – highlighted in grey ) , which was then excluded from all further downstream analyses . We also controlled for possible contamination with cells from the primitive endoderm . We verified that the E5 . 0 samples do not show any expression of primitive endoderm markers like Gata6 , Gata4 , Sox17 , Sox7 and Pdgfra . As for samples from E4 . 5 and E4 . 75 embryos , they all cluster with the epiblast samples previously published by Boroviak et al ( see Extended Data Fig . 1g ) , except for one sample ( “E4 . 5 _ Sample3” ) that was found in the primitive endoderm cluster and was therefore excluded from further analysis ( see below for details on the clustering algorithm ) . The samples that passed the quality check were normalized for sequencing depth using size factors 43 calculated on endogenous genes . Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering The principal component analyses ( PCAs ) plots shown in Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 1f and h were generated using the log10 - transformed read counts ( by summing 1 to avoid infinities ) of the union of the 5 , 000 most highly expressed genes in each sample . The hierarchical clustering shown in Fig . 1c and Extended Data Fig . 1g was based on the dissimilarity matrix defined as ( 1 - ρ ) / 2 , where ρ is the Spearman correlation coefficient between pairs of samples or genes . Once the dissimilarity matrix was calculated , the hierarchical tree was generated with the R function “hclust” with the “average” agglomeration method . Differential Expression Analysis The Bioconductor package DESeq2 44 was used to find differentially expressed genes between E5 . 0 samples and E4 . 5 - E4 . 75 samples at a 0 . 1 false discovery rate . Before running DESeq2 , genes with an average expression level of less than 1 normalized read counts across all samples were excluded . Comparing our dataset to data in Boroviak et al In Extended Data Fig . 1h , before selecting the genes for the PCA , we pooled together our data with the ICM and epiblast samples previously published in Boroviak et al ( FPKM normalized read - counts available from the cited paper ) and performed a quantile normalization . The log - fold - changes plotted in Extended Data Fig . 1i were computed after adding a pseudo - count of 0 . 1 . The genes used for the clustering in Supplementary Extended Data Fig . 1g are those differentially expressed between epiblast and primitive endoderm at E4 . 5 as reported by Boroviak et al . Statistical analyses : Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism ( excluding the analysis of the sequencing data ) . Embryos were randomly allocated to control and experimental groups . Sample size was determined based on previous experimental experience . Investigators were not blinded to group allocation . Quantitative data is presented as a contingency table and was analyzed with a Chi - square test . Quantitative data is presented as mean ± s . e . m . and was analyzed for normality using a D’Agostino - Pearson omnibus normality test . Data that presented a Gaussian distribution was analyzed using a two - tailed unpaired Student’s test ( two groups ) or an ANOVA test ( multiple groups ) with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test . Significant differences in the variance were taken into account using a Welch’s correction . Data that did not present a Gaussian distribution was analyzed using a Mann - Whitney test ( two groups ) or a Kruskal - Wallis test ( multiple groups ) with a Dunn’s multiple comparison test . For all quantifications a minimum of two independent experiments was performed . Sequencing data was analyzed with standard programs and packages . Code is available on request .

( n = 4 E4 . 5 , 4 E4 . 75 and 4 E5 . 0 embryos ) b - f , For all the collected samples we computed the total number of read counts ( b ) , the fraction of reads mapped to endogenous genes ( c ) , the number of genes with more than 10 reads per million ( d ) and the fraction of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes ( e ) . A PCA of these metrics is shown in f . The sample coloured in grey ( E4 . 5 _ Sample1 ) is characterised by a very low fraction of mapped reads and number of genes detected and was therefore removed from all downstream analysis . g , Hierarchical clustering of the E4 . 5 - E4 . 75 samples that passed the quality check ( black ) and samples from the epiblast ( red ) and primitive endoderm ( blue ) at E4 . 5 from Boroviak et al .

Squares , circles and triangles mark genes differentially expressed in both datasets , only in our dataset or only in Boroviak et al dataset respectively . The naïve pluripotency genes significantly downregulated at E5 . 5 were highly enriched among genes downregulated at E5 . 0 ( p - value 7x10 - 8 , Fisher’s exact test ) , whereas the enrichment of upregulated early post - implantation factors was only marginally significant ( p - value = 0 . 03 , Fisher’s exact test ) . j , Brightfield images of cells derived from embryos cultured in IVC1 ( 0 / 6 mESC colonies from IVC1 embryos and 4 / 6 mESC colonies from IVC1 + 2i / LIF embryos ) .
