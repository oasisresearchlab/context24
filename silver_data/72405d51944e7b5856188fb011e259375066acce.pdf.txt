Although the transition of planar filaments into 3D membrane budding structures is fundamental for their function , the geometric changes in polymer architecture driving the transition remain obscure . Here we show how bacterial Vipp1 polymerises into dynamic planar sheets and spirals on membrane . The spirals converge to form a central ring like those known to bud membrane . To probe how Vipp1 morphs between polymers , we determine the architecture of multiple helical filaments . As well as describing filament constriction and membrane tubulation , the geometric relationship between helical and planar lattices enables Vipp1 sheets and spirals to be modelled . Moreover , the helical structures show filaments twisting – a process needed for Vipp1 to transition between planar and 3D architectures . Given the structural conservation between Vipp1 and ESCRT - III , our results may represent the broad changes in geometry required for some ESCRT - III filaments to switch between 2D and 3D forms . Keywords : Vipp1 / IM30 , ESCRT - III , sheet and spiral and ring structure , membrane remodelling and repair , fast atomic force microscopy , cryogenic electron microscopy . Introduction ESCRT - III ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport - III ) family members are ancient membrane remodelling devices with an evolutionary lineage that traces back to LUCA , the last universal common ancestor of cells 1 . Over time the family has radiated across the tree of life acquiring often essential and conserved functions . In eukaryotes and archaea , ESCRT - III systems drive membrane abscission during cell division 2 , promote viral replication and budding 3 , 4 , and mediate extracellular vesicle biogenesis 5 , 6 . Other important functions specific to eukaryotes include multivesicular body biogenesis 7 and membrane repair 8 . In bacteria , where PspA and its paralogue Vipp1 ( also IM30 ) were recently discovered as ESCRT - III homologues 1 , 9 , these proteins function in membrane stress response and repair . PspA is triggered by agents that threaten the inner membrane including phage , mislocalised secretins and antibiotics 10 – 14 ; whilst Vipp1 is a universal plastid component in cyanobacteria , algae , and 3 plants where it undertakes essential functions in thylakoid membrane biogenesis and repair 15 – 24 . ESCRT - III family members have a conserved core fold consisting of five helices , a 1 - a 5 1 , 25 . Whilst helices a 1 and a 2 form a characteristic hairpin motif , in some systems helices a 3 - a 5 switch conformation between open , intermediate , and closed 26 . Some ESCRT - III family members such as Vipp1 , Vps2 / CHMP2 , Vps24 / CHMP3 , and Snf7 / CHMP4 supplement the core fold with an N - terminal motif or amphipathic helix ( termed helix a 0 ) that mediates membrane binding 13 , 27 – 29 . C - terminal to helix a 5 are less conserved elements 1 that mediate protein interactions in most eukaryotic ESCRT - III systems 25 . In this region , Vipp1 has a ~ 40 amino acid C - terminal domain ( CTD ) that is flexible and may incorporate helix a 6 30 . The CTD tunes Vipp1 polymerisation dynamics both in - vivo and in - vitro 1 , 30 , 31 and might constitute a second lipid binding domain that promotes membrane fusion 31 , 32 . Using the core fold as a building block , ESCRT - III family members assemble conserved filaments characterised by the hairpin motif of neighbouring subunits stacking side - by - side with helix a 5 binding in a domain swop across the hairpin tip 1 , 7 , 9 , 33 , 34 . This filament is used to build different supramolecular structures including spirals 33 , 35 – 44 , helical filaments 9 , 33 , 43 , 45 and dome - shaped rings 1 , 34 . In bacteria , although Synechocystis Vipp1 46 and PspA 9 form planar patches , spiral filaments have not been reported , which currently represents a key differentiating factor from their eukaryotic counterparts . The assembly of ESCRT - III filaments is fundamental to their membrane remodelling mechanism with the formation of planar spirals on the membrane surface an early key step . Current models describe spirals as loaded springs with elastic stress accumulating due to a preferred radius of curvature . Stress is highest at the spiral perimeter and centre where the filament is under - curved or over - curved , respectively . This stress , which constitutes an energy store , is theoretically sufficient to bend membrane 40 , 47 . Energy minimisation , through the buckling of planar spiral filaments to 3D polymers such as conical spirals or helices , is directly coupled to the mechanical shaping of bound membrane . An important component of the model depends on the sequential tilting of polymer orientation relative to the membrane 48 , 49 , with exposure to tilted membrane binding interfaces within the filament a driver of membrane deformation 49 , 50 . Notably , by simply switching the position of the membrane binding interface to be oriented towards the inside or outside of the tilted filament , the 4 direction of membrane budding can theoretically be reversed with the filament binding and exerting force from the outside or inside of the membrane , respectively 48 . How ESCRT - III subunits are arranged within these planar or twisted filaments when bound to membrane remains unclear . The structure of Vipp1 when assembled as a dome - shaped ring , combined with the observation that these rings are sufficient to bud membrane , represented an alternative mechanism for how ESCRT - III family members remodel membrane . Vipp1 rings recruited to the surface of both monolayers and precurved lipid bilayers bud the membrane by internalising it within the ring lumen . This movement is mediated by membrane - binding domains ( helix a 0 ) lining the inner lumen so that membrane is drawn in via a capillary action - like mechanism . Although Vipp1 and PspA have the capacity to bind and hydrolyse nucleotides 34 , 55 , this mode of ring - mediated membrane remodelling occurs passively without chemical energy turnover , at least in - vitro . The capacity of Vipp1 rings to bud membrane independently of spiral springs hints that a similar process may be an unrecognised contributory factor in eukaryotic ESCRT - III membrane remodelling processes where rings are assembled , albeit transiently , in the centre of spirals 51 . The biogenesis pathway for Vipp1 rings is unknown . It is also unclear how Vipp1 rings , as well as other polymers such as helical filaments , might relate structurally and functionally to membrane bound planar forms that stabilise and reduce proton permeability in liposomes 46 . These planar forms may be fundamental for how Vipp1 and PspA function in membrane stabilisation and repair across bacteria . Here we use a fusion of light microscopy , fast - atomic force microscopy ( F - AFM ) and electron microscopy ( EM ) to show how Vipp1 rings originate from a planar spiral progenitor . By assembling and comparing structural models for different types of Vipp1 polymer including planar sheets , spiral filaments , helices and rings , we suggest a model for Vipp1 ring biogenesis that has implication for how other ESCRT - III systems bud membrane . Results Vipp1 is a membrane sensor recruited to highly curved and perturbed membranes Vipp1 from Nostoc punctiforme was purified in a low salt ( 10 mM NaCl ) buffer ( Figure 1A ) . This yielded various 3D polymers including helical filaments , helical - like ribbons , and some dome - shaped rings 1 . This Vipp1 sample was used throughout this study unless otherwise 5 specified . To study Vipp1 dynamics on membrane , Vipp1 was labelled with Alexa488 ( termed Vipp1 Alexa448 ) , introduced into a flow chamber incorporating supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ; Figure 1B ) , and imaged by confocal microscopy . This methodology was previously used to characterise how the ESCRT - III protein Snf7 interacted with model membranes 40 . Whilst Snf7 formed evenly distributed patches on the membrane surface , Vipp1 Alexa448 formed a localised coating at the SLB edge ( Figure 1C ) . Here , the membrane was highly curved with regions of poorly packed or perturbed lipid expected . Shifting to buffer conditions with 500 mM NaCl promoted the partial disassembly of polymers ( Figure 1A ) and reduced larger soluble fluorescent foci and background fluorescence . However , Vipp1 Alexa448 still targeted the highly curved SLB edge ( Figure 1C - 1E ) . Where neighbouring SLBs fused and coated leading edges were flattened at the membrane merge point , bound Vipp1 Alexa448 rapidly disassembled from the membrane supporting the notion of a highly dynamic interaction with the membrane edge ( Figure 1F ) . In summary , this data revealed Vipp1 Alexa488 to have a strong preference for highly curved and perturbed membrane and was consistent with Vipp1 functioning as a membrane curvature sensor . Vipp1 assembles dynamic networks of spirals , rings and sheets on membrane To further resolve the dynamics and architecture of Vipp1 on the membrane edge , we utilised F - AFM which provided high temporal and spatial resolutions . Consistent with the fluorescent microscopy data ( Figure 1C - 1F ) , Vipp1 accumulated at the edge of SLB patches , again indicating a sensing capability for highly curved or perturbed membrane ( Figure 2A ) . However , we did not observe 3D polymers such as helical filaments ( Figure 1A ) binding as expected . Instead , Vipp1 grew as dynamic planar filaments that curled anticlockwise to form spirals or sometimes rings ( Figures 2B , 2C , Supplementary Figure 1A and Videos S1 - S2 ) . These filaments grew from small oligomers ( or monomers ) that originated from disassembled 3D polymers given the sample was originally gel filtrated . Filaments grew into unpopulated membrane regions so that ultimately networks of planar sheets , spiral filaments and rings covered the entire lipid surface within minutes . Sometimes filaments split indicating a protofilament substructure or nascent filaments grew alongside established filaments to form planar sheets ( Supplementary Figures 1B and 1C ) . Conversely , sheets separated branching off filaments that curled into spirals ( Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 1C ) . Membrane height offset for both sheet and spiral filaments was ~ 5 . 5 nm suggesting a close structural 6 relationship ( Figure 2E ) . Filaments grew at a mean rate of 24 ± ( a standard deviation of ) 19 . 6 nm / s , N = 124 independent measurements ( Figure 2F ) and with generally uniform width with mean 13 . 4 ± 0 . 9 nm , N = 13 ( Figure 2G ) . Spiral mean diameter was 82 . 7 nm ± 37 . 8 , N = 276 ( Figure 2H ) with a mean area of 6485 ± 6303 nm 2 , N = 276 ( Figure 2I ) . These spirals were reminiscent of Snf7 spirals 40 although when packed they did not deform into polygons like Snf7 , indicating an increased stiffness for the Vipp1 filament . They also did not fragment towards the spiral perimeter as was characteristic of Snf7 . Spirals curled in either Archimedes or exponential forms towards their centre until filaments reached a curvature limit beyond which further curling was impeded resulting in filament merging and formation of closed rings ( Figures 2D and 3A ) . This spiral maturation and ring biogenesis correlated with increasing height offset between spiral inner turns and the membrane ( Figures 3B , Supplementary Figure 1A and Video S3 ) . In mature spirals , rings protruded 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 nm ( N = 16 ) above surrounding spiral filaments ( Figure 3C ) and eventually detached from the parent spiral ( Figure 3A and 3D , Supplementary Figure 1A ) . These rings , that originated from spirals under low salt buffer conditions ( 10 mM NaCl ) and with mean diameter 37 . 0 ± 3 . 9 nm ( N = 39 ) were termed Vipp1 rings LS ( Figure 3E and 3F ) . Periodically , rings formed spontaneously on the curved edge of SLBs or on isolated lipid micro - patches in the absence of a parent spiral ( Supplementary Figure 1A , 1D and 1E ) . Here , the nascent Vipp1 filament grew spatially constrained by the membrane support or surrounding planar filaments . In these instances , mean ring height was 6 . 0 ± 0 . 6 nm , N = 22 , which was similar to Vipp1 rings LS ( Supplementary Figure 1E ) . However , mean diameter was generally wider 49 . 1 ± 7 . 8 nm ( N = 39 ) than Vipp1 rings LS ( Figure 3E and 3F ) showing how maximum bending curvature was not generally achieved without the corralling effect of a spiral . Vipp1 rings scan and bind damaged membrane Previously , dome - shaped rings were purified and structurally characterised revealing a mix of core symmetries ranging from C11 to C17 with diameters from 24 nm to 34 nm , respectively 1 . Larger well - ordered C20 symmetry rings with 41 nm diameter were also prevalent in the sample with the largest abundant ring class ~ 43 nm diameter ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . To obtain these pre - assembled rings , the sample was purified in a high salt ( 50 mM NaCl ) buffer 1 . Here , we termed these rings Vipp1 rings HS to distinguish them from Vipp1 rings LS . Given the potential similarity between Vipp1 rings HS and Vipp1 rings LS , we aimed to characterise Vipp1 7 rings HS by F - AFM . Vipp1 rings HS exposed to SLBs bound the membrane surface and maintained their pre - assembled ring structure ( Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure 2B ) . Intriguingly , Vipp1 rings HS targeted the highly curved edge of membrane patches or rupture lines in the lipid . Vipp1 rings HS therefore have the remarkable capability of scanning membrane surfaces for damaged regions before targeting them for binding . By F - AFM , Vipp1 rings HS had a mean diameter of 35 . 5 ± 2 . 9 nm , N = 20 ( Figure 3E and 3F ) , which correlated well with the mean diameter of Vipp1 rings LS and the larger ring diameters observed by EM ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) 1 . Vipp1 rings HS had a mean height of 9 . 6 ± 2 . 2 nm , N = 46 ( Supplementary Figure 2C ) , which was ~ 3 nm higher than Vipp1 rings LS but markedly lower than cryo - EM determined Vipp1 ring HS heights between ~ 15 - 21 nm for C11 - C17 symmetries 1 . For the latter , the height difference was likely due to disassembly of the lower rungs of the dome - shaped rings into the membrane once bound , although compression from the F - AFM tip cannot be discounted . Overall , Vipp1 rings HS function as membrane sensing scaffolds and are broadly similar in shape and form to Vipp1 rings LS when measured by F - AFM ( Figure 3H ) . Next we examined the effect of low salt ( 10 mM NaCl ) on Vipp1 rings HS . Intriguingly , Vipp1 rings HS were no longer observed binding the lipid . Instead , they disassembled and nucleated spirals , sheets and rings that grew from the membrane edge ( Supplementary Figure 2D and 2E ) . Negative stain EM verified the polymeric state of Vipp1 rings HS in the low salt buffer ( Supplementary Figure 2F ) although rings had increased tendency to clump or unfurl into quasi - helical ribbons showcasing the effect of low salt on destabilising the rings and promoting a transition towards helical - like filaments . Vipp1 spiral filaments and planar sheets have closely related lattices To analyse the relationship between Vipp1 sheet and spiral filament ultrastructure under low salt conditions ( 10 mM NaCl ) , lower velocity AFM images were obtained which revealed remarkable detail . Sheets were highly ordered forming parallel stripes or ridges spaced 54 Å apart ( Figure 4A ) . Orthogonal to the ridge lines , parallel seams could be discerned in the sheets spaced 122 Å apart , which was consistent with the width of the filaments in spiral turns ( Figure 2G ) . This supports a model where sheets form planar crystalline super structures comprised of merged filaments ~ 12 - 13 nm across and are predisposed to branch and spiral at the seam points . Analysis of spiral filaments also revealed parallel ridges spaced 54 Å apart ( Figure 4B ) . Neighbouring spiral turns sometimes merged indicating filaments may transition 8 into localised sheet patches under different conditions . To further resolve Vipp1 planar ultrastructure , Vipp1 was exposed to lipid monolayers . In contrast to the SLB system where Vipp1 3D polymers did not bind directly to the membrane ( apart from Vipp1 rings HS ) , 3D polymers such as rod - like filaments ( ~ 35 nm diameter ) were sometimes observed bound to the lipid monolayer surface ( Figure 4C ) . These presumably originated as ordered helical filaments in the initial sample ( Figure 1A ) . They often had tips that appeared to be flattening and merging with the surrounding milieu . Remarkably , close inspection of the background monolayer revealed striped filamentous filaments forming spirals or concentric turns that often merged into wider sheets . Rings were usually observed in the spiral centre . After ~ 15 minutes incubation , this dense mosaic of filaments spanned many microns in diameter ( Figure 4D ) . By extracting and aligning 35 nm 2 filament subsections , class averages were generated revealing a 54 Å spacing between filament stripes . Given this spacing and the width of the filaments was ~ 12 - 14 nm , we concluded that these Vipp1 filaments were equivalent to those formed on SLBs . Overall , this data supported a model where spiral filaments and planar sheets have equivalent ultrastructure with the 54 Å repeat a key building block in polymer assembly . Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 truncation forms tightly packed planar spirals and highly ordered sheets Truncation of the Vipp1 CTD ( termed Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 ) somehow modulates Vipp1 polymerisation dynamics . Specifically , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 purified in low salt conditions ( 10 mM NaCl ) has a greater propensity to form ordered helical filaments and quasi - helical ring stacks ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) than Vipp1 1 . We therefore investigated how CTD removal would affect Vipp1 behaviour on SLBs and lipid monolayers . When mixed with SLBs and visualised by F - AFM , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 bound the SLB edges like Vipp1 . However , edges were coated with thin curled sheets or compact spirals where turns were usually interconnected with no central ring formed ( Supplementary Figure 3B ) . Both spiral filaments and planar sheets had ~ 6 nm height offsets from the membrane like Vipp1 ( Supplementary Figure 3C ) . Remarkably , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 had the capacity to form dense crystalline planar sheets up to a micron in width with parallel surface ridges 54 Å apart ( Supplementary Figure 3D ) . Based on these dimensions , we concluded that Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 spirals and planar sheets have closely related ultrastructure to those of Vipp1 . Overall , truncation of the CTD reduced filament dynamics so that spirals merged with a tendency to form sheets . 9 Importantly , detailed analysis of Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 sheets showed how they curl and gave important insights into rules that govern Vipp1 polymer curvature . When filaments curl , the rigid 54 Å - spaced substructure experiences tension or compression on the longer outside or shorter inside of the bend , respectively . Due to the width of sheets , curling occurs by adding filament sections into the outside of bends ( wedging ) whilst simultaneously removing sections on the inside ( Supplementary Figure 3E and 3F ) . This exposes how flexibility between the 54 Å ridges is limited with only a defined squeezing or stretching of the spacing possible . This rule extends to the thinner spiral filaments , which are also governed by the 54 Å repeating substructure . Here , filament curvature is seldom induced by wedging ( Figure 4B ) . Instead , filaments achieve high curvature either by inducing lattice breaks or rather by tilting and transitioning to 3D structures to alleviate elastic stress 40 , 47 . Subsequent analysis of Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 exposed to lipid monolayer revealed rod - like filament structures bound to the surface that were transitioning to a planar - like array ( Supplementary Figure 3G ) . In the background , a mosaic of planar filaments corralled around apparent raised regions and areas with ruptured monolayer ( Supplementary Figure 3H ) . Consistent with the F - AFM data , filaments formed larger curved sheets so that distinct spirals were not readily observed ( Supplementary Figure 3I ) . Notably , both a 54 Å and orthogonal 32 Å spacing was now detected , with the latter consistent with the axial rise between subunits in neighbouring rungs of Vipp1 rings 1 . Overall , our data supported a model where Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 builds planar polymers with the same substructure as Vipp1 . The CTD has the effect of tuning Vipp1 polymer stability and dynamism . In its absence , Vipp1 has a higher avidity to form polymers with increased regularity and stability . Vipp1 helical filaments have a lattice closely related to Vipp1 rings HS Given 2D planar sheets share a close geometric relationship with helical lattices 52 , and as a means of understanding the interconnectedness of Vipp1 polymers including rings , spirals and planar sheets , we determined the structure of four different Vipp1 helical filaments by cryo - EM ( Table S1 ) . Specifically , Vipp1 and a Vipp1 Interface 3 mutant F197K / L200K 1 assembled using equivalent helical parameters and lattices ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) and were termed Vipp1 L1 and Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 , respectively . Alternatively , Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 assembled with related but different lattices termed Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 . For all 10 samples , conditions were screened to enrich for helical filaments although additional polymer types remained mixed . Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 formed longer and more stable helical filaments in comparison to native Vipp1 1 with helical - like ribbons and rings observed ( Figure 5A ) . In all samples , helical filaments were heterogeneous with multiple symmetries that required extensive in - silico classification to achieve near - uniform symmetry bins . Helical parameters could not initially be determined from low quality C1 symmetry reconstructions . Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 was the only lattice form where class averages of aligned particles yielded a Fourier Transform with non - overlapping layer lines amenable to indexing ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . This gave a grid of possible symmetries which were systematically tested . Only helical parameters with rise = 2 . 16 Å and rotation = 85 . 50˚ gave a high - resolution map to 3 . 7 Å resolution ( Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 4A ) with excellent side chain detail enabling model building from amino acids 1 - 217 ( Figure 5C ) . Map quality was lowest around helix a 5C indicative of instability within Interface 1 – a trait observed for all Vipp1 helical filaments to differing degrees . Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 was ~ 24 . 4 nm in diameter with a hollow inner lumen diameter of ~ 12 . 7 nm . Overall , the Vipp1 subunits self - assembled using similar interfaces as for Vipp1 ring HS polymerisation 1 indicating a close relationship between helical and ring polymers ( Figure 5D - 5F ) . Specifically , Vipp1 formed ESCRT - III - like protofilaments ( Figure 5G - 5I ) where hairpin motifs packed side by side and the C - terminus of helix 5 ( a 5C ) of subunit j bound across the hairpin tip of subunit j + 3 to form the classical Interface 1 domain swop ( Figure 5D and 5E ) . These protofilaments formed a 17 - start right - handed helix that ran diagonally around the helical axis ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) . Concurrently , each hairpin tip bound the N - terminus of helix 5 ( a 5N ) in a neighbouring protofilament thereby forming Interface 3 ( Figure 5D ) 1 . Neighbouring protofilaments aligned laterally to form a 4 - start left - handed helix where subunits connected through the stacking of helices a 0 and the formation of Interface 2 ( Figure 5F ) 1 . Helix a 0 lipid binding domains therefore lined and twisted around the inner lumen of the filament . The 4 - start helix has a pitch of 44 Å and forms diagonal parallel ridges that encircle the helical axis and dominate the surface topology of the Vipp1 helical filament . For Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 , the structure was closely related to Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 although different helical parameters yielded a modified helical lattice with a slight lattice rotation relative to the helical axis ( Supplementary Figure 5A - C ) . Overall , the Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 structures revealed the close relationship between Vipp1 helical and ring HS polymers highlighting how only 11 relatively minor adjustments to assembly dynamics would facilitate transition between these forms . Comparison of Vipp1 L1 with Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 revealed a mechanism for filament constriction In comparison to Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 sample , Vipp1 was characterised by unfurled ring stacks or helical - like ribbons with fewer and shorter ordered helical filaments suggesting a reduced stability for helical polymerisation ( Supplementary Figure 6A ) . Although the Fourier transforms of Vipp1 L1 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 class averages were similar with closely related lattices , only helical parameters with rise = 2 . 37 Å and rotation = - 75 . 86˚ yielded a Vipp1 L1 map to 3 . 7 Å resolution overall ( Supplementary Figures 4 and 6B ) . Map local resolution range was broadest compared to other Vipp1 helical forms with inner parts of the filament well resolved compared to the periphery where the hairpin tips and helix a 5 were more poorly ordered ( Supplementary Figures 6C ) . The Vipp1 L1 subunit was built between amino acids 1 - 214 ( Supplementary Figures 6D and 6E ) and assembled using similar interfaces as for Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 . However , the Vipp1 L1 subunit differed to Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 subunits with its hairpin tip kinked at Ile68 and helix a 5 compacted ( Supplementary Figures 6D and 6E ) so that Interfaces 1 and 3 were perturbed . Although map potential relating to the CTD could not be assigned , our structures were consistent with this motif destabilising Interface 1 possibly through kinking of the hairpin whilst also directly or indirectly limiting Interface 3 formation . The effect of the CTD on Interfaces 1 and 3 thereby present a mechanism for Vipp1 L1 helical filament instability and CTD - mediated tuning of Vipp1 polymer dynamics 1 , 30 , 31 . Compared with Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 , the Vipp1 L1 filament was constricted with a ~ 21 . 0 nm and ~ 10 . 5 nm external and inner diameter , respectively . The mechanism for this ~ 2nm inner lumen constriction was through subunit removal . Specifically , the left - handed 21 - start helix in Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 that runs almost parallel to the helix axis now formed a 19 - start helix in Vipp1 L1 ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) . Concurrently , the number of ESCRT - III - like protofilaments was reduced to a 14 - start right - handed helix . Filament constriction was mediated by angular adjustments of helices a 3 and a 4 resulting in a ~ 7 . 5 Å upward flexing ( Supplementary Figures 6E ) . These intra - subunit conformational changes were accompanied by subtle adjustments in subunit lattice packing resulting in a Vipp1 L1 protofilament with 12 higher curvature than Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 or Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 ( Supplementary 6F and Video S4 ) . Overall , the comparison of Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 filaments provided a mechanism for constriction where CTD - mediated adjustments to lattice assembly induced a reduction of ESCRT - III - like protofilaments and consequently a reduction in filament circumference . Our data was consistent with a model where the CTD played a key role in tuning Vipp1 assembly dynamics and has the capacity to drive helical filament constriction . Vipp1 polymers tubulate membrane along the same plane from different orientations The Vipp1 F197K / L200K mutations impeded Interface 3 resulting in long helical filaments 1 that often had a membrane vesicle cap at their tips ( Figure 6A ) . Spheroid and helical tubule - like membrane vesicles coated in Vipp1 F197K / L200K were also observed . The membrane was presumably bound during purification from E . coli . Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 was resolved to 3 . 7 Å overall ( Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 4A ) using helical parameters of rise = 2 . 44 Å and rotation = - 75 . 83˚ , which were almost identical to those of Vipp1 L1 . Excellent map quality and side chain detail facilitated model building ( Supplementary Figure 5D ) . Notably , this included flexible hinge 2 , which was well ordered in comparison to other Vipp1 maps . Overall , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 and Vipp1 L1 subunits were in similar conformations ( Supplementary Figure 5E ) and assembled using equivalent helical lattices ( Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure 4 ) . However , due to the Vipp1 F197K / L200K mutation , Interface 3 formation was inhibited with no supporting map and build for helix a 5N . No map potential was located for C - terminal helix a 6 . The key difference between Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 and Vipp1 L1 maps was the presence of lipid bilayer in the central lumen . Here , the inner leaflet formed a 4 nm diameter tube , which is close to the limit where hemifusion is expected to occur , whilst the outer leaflet filled the space between the helix a 0 stacks ( Figure 6D ) . Analysis of the Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 electrostatic surface potential showed amphipathic helix a 0 to be positively charged with basic residues positioned to attract negatively charged lipid headgroups . Hydrophobic residues oriented along the inner lumen face then contact the fatty acid chains ( Figure 6E ) . Importantly , the structure of Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 facilitated a comparison of Vipp1 helical and ring HS polymers when bound to membrane . In the C14 symmetry Vipp1 ring HS , the ESCRT - III - like protofilaments formed rungs that were orthogonal to the membrane bud / tube axis 1 . In Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 , the ESCRT - III - like protofilaments were rotated ~ 43˚ to the membrane tube 13 axis whilst maintaining similar lateral interactions and ultrastructure by undergoing filament twist ( Figure 6F ) . Therefore , by forming a 3D pliable polymer , the Vipp1 lattice can induce membrane tubulation along the same axis but by using radically different lattice orientations . To facilitate the transition from Vipp1 ring HS to helical polymer , significant conformational changes were observed within individual subunits to accommodate the relative shift in membrane plane ( Figure 6G and Video S5 ) . Mediated by Hinges 1 and 2 , helices a 3 and a 4 flexed upwards and outwards ~ 9˚ and ~ 20˚ , respectively . Concurrently , Hinge 3 facilitated additional shifts in helix a 5C orientation cumulating in a ~ 52 Å swing as measured for Ala211 in helix a 5C . In addition , the length of the Vipp1 subunit was reduced from 158 Å in Vipp1 ring HS to 149 Å in Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 between the hairpin tip and helix a 4 terminus . This important compaction was mediated by Hinge 1 with the N - terminus of helix a 4 now overlapping the C - terminus of helix a 3 . Overall , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 showed how N . punctiforme Vipp1 helical filaments have the capacity to tubulate membrane , as reported in other Vipp1 systems 53 . Moreover , it shows that the transition between helical and ring conformations relative to the membrane plane is induced by lattice rotation and filament twist rather than through a novel polymer form . This is important as the transition of ESCRT - III planar spirals and rings to 3D spirals likely requires filament rotation relative to the membrane plane , as has already been glimpsed 26 , 33 , 50 . Discussion Here we show how the bacterial ESCRT - III - like protein Vipp1 assembles dynamic planar spirals and sheets on membrane supports . Moreover , the spirals assemble central rings that protrude and abscise from the parent filament . These rings share dimensions with Vipp1 HS rings known to bud membrane . In addition , we show the structure of four different Vipp1 helical filaments with three related but different lattice assemblies . They show the close connection between 2D planar , helical and Vipp1 HR ring polymers with the transition between the latter two achieved by a remarkable lattice rotation and twist ( Figure 7A ) around the same membrane plane . Given these different polymer forms are highly ordered , their comparison provides a basis for modelling how Vipp1 builds planar filaments that transition to 3D membrane budding forms . Collectively , our results suggest a general mechanism for how Vipp1 may stabilise and repair membrane . 14 Both F - AFM and NS - EM data show Vipp1 planar sheets and filaments to be characterised by parallel ridges with a 54 Å repeat ( Figure 4A , 4B , and 4D ) . Additionally , the Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 planar filaments include a 32 Å repeat orthogonal to the 54 Å spacing ( Supplementary Figure 3I ) . By calculating the cylindrical projection 54 of the Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 helical filament ( Supplementary Figure 7A ) the 3D map may be represented as a geometrically equivalent 2D lattice . The 4 - start left - handed helix is the dominant feature forming parallel stripes with 44 Å pitch . These stripes relate to the ridges on the Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 filament surface when visualised by cryogenic electron tomography ( Supplementary Figure 7B ) . Inter - ridge distance is formed by the spacing between neighbouring hairpins within each ESCRT - III - like filament ( Supplementary Figure 7C ) . Intriguingly , inter - hairpin distance has a degree of flexibility with hairpins sliding up to 14 Å relative to each other in Vipp1 HS rings depending on rung position ( Supplementary Figure 7D ) . In Vipp1 HS C17 symmetry rings , hairpin spacing spans 53 - 59 Å in the central rungs with each neighbouring ESCRT - III - like filament 32 - 33 Å apart ( Supplementary Figure 7C ) . Overall , the lattice dimensions of helical and ring HS polymers are consistent with those obtained from the Fourier Transform of Vipp1 and Vipp1 Da 6 1 - 219 planar sheets and filaments on a lipid monolayer ( Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure 3I ) and SLBs ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . Our data therefore supports a model where Vipp1 planar sheets and spiral filaments are geometrically similar to unfurled and flattened Vipp1 rings HS or helical filaments with the key assembly Interfaces 1 - 3 maintained . Sheets and spiral filaments comprise parallel ESCRT - III - like protofilaments ( Figure 5E ) with the ridges running near orthogonal to the protofilament axis ( Figure 7B ) . The 122 Å spacing observed as seams within the sheets is close to the F - AFM - measured ~ 13 nm width of spiral filaments ( Figure 2G ) and is consistent with spiral filaments comprising four or sometimes five parallel protofilaments . Snf7 spirals generally form from just one protofilament , which likely explains their increased compressibility and deformation into polygons 40 . As Vipp1 spiral filaments grow centrally , curvature increases with each turn building elastic stress 40 , 47 . For spiral filaments to curve , our data supports a model where hairpin sliding and subunit flexing via hinges 1 - 3 enable each planar filament to curl laterally on the membrane plane with the inter - ridge distance shortening on the inside of the filament and extending on the outside . However , based on measurements from different rungs in Vipp1 rings HS1 , inter - ridge distance cannot compress below ~ 41 Å or stretch greater than ~ 61 Å 15 ( Supplementary Figure 7D ) . These distances are insufficient to facilitate the high level of curvature observed in the filaments or rings LS at the centre of spirals if in a strictly planar form . Therefore , once inter - ridge distance limits are reached , residual curvature - induced elastic stress must now be minimised either by breaking the filament , wedging ( Supplementary Figure 3F ) or through filament tilt and transitioning to a 3D form . For Vipp1 filaments , tilt is observed by mounting height offset from the membrane particularly within central turns of the spiral ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 1A ) . In the centre of each Vipp1 spiral where filament curvature was highest , Vipp1 rings LS formed which protruded an additional ~ 1 nm above the surrounding spiral filaments due to filament tilt . Ridges were sometimes observable on the outside face of Vipp1 rings LS showcasing filament tilt ( Figure 7B ) . Importantly , the filament twist observed in Vipp1 helical polymers ( Figure 7A ) provided a mechanism for how ESCRT - III - like filaments tilt and bind membrane on different planes thereby enabling Vipp1 to transition from planar to 3D ring architectures ( Figure 7B ) . In ESCRT - III , changes in geometry of membrane bound filaments , including filament tilt , underlie membrane deformation from a planar spiral to a 3D helix 26 , 48 , 49 . Ultimately , filament tilt in Vipp1 rings LS relative to the parent spiral induce torsion and promote abscission . Although Vipp1 rings HS have a substantially lower height when measured by F - AFM ( Supplementary Figure 2C ) in comparison to structural measurements 1 , our data was consistent with Vipp1 rings LS constituting ~ 3 - 4 rungs rather than 5 - 7 rungs in a mature Vipp1 ring HS ( Figure 7B ) . Final maturation steps may require a non - rigid membrane support , changes in membrane composition or additional factors such as nucleotide 34 , 55 . Collectively , our results provide a mechanism for how Vipp1 functions in membrane stabilisation and repair ( Figure 7C ) in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts . Both Vipp1 small oligomers ( or monomers ) and rings HS sense and bind highly curved and perturbed membrane . This finding is consistent with Vipp1 locating to the highly curved edges of thylakoid membranes 18 . Depending on the conditions , the small oligomers can polymerise into spirals that encircle the damaged region , which may incorporate protein complexes 19 , 56 , 57 , ultimately assembling a central ring structure . Mature Vipp1 rings HS have the capacity to bud membrane thereby supporting a repair mechanism based on membrane squeezing and fusion 1 . Alternatively , by tuning the CTD , spiral filaments can readily anneal to form planar crystalline concentric or linear sheets ( Supplementary Figure 3D ) , which would stabilise damaged membrane acting as a physical barrier and supporting scaffold . Such structures explain how 16 Vipp1 and other bacterial homologues such as PspA might inhibit proton leakage across membranes 46 , 58 . Finally , Vipp1 helical filaments may form membrane bridges linking thylakoids and the chloroplast envelope 34 . In conclusion , our results utilise Vipp1 as a model system to show how planar filaments transition to 3D rings . The structural homology between Vipp1 and other ESCRT - III proteins suggest that the basic principles observed here , including conserved ultrastructure between planar and 3D forms , filament tilt and twist , and lattice rotation on an equivalent membrane plane , will extend to other family members .

Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 map was resolved to 3 . 8 Å overall using helical parameters rise = 2 . 16 Å and rotation = 68 . 50˚ . B , Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 map fitted with Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 helical filament structure ( top left ) . The coloured monomer is isolated and zoomed to show map quality , build and fit . Map contoured between 3 - 4 s . Map local resolution range was broader than for Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 with generally lower map quality around helix a 5 . The Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 lattice therefore has increased instability in comparison to Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 although residual heterogeneity in the particle stack cannot be discounted as a contributory factor in reducing map quality . C , Structure of the Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 helical filament . Bessel orders n = 16 and n = - 5 are indicated with pitch . Specifically , the ESCRT - III - like protofilaments form a 16 - start right - handed helix which twist around the helical axis with a 46 Å pitch . Concurrently , these protofilaments align to form a 5 - start left - handed helix with a 46 Å pitch . In comparison to Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 4 ) , the effect is to rotate the Vipp1 lattice ~ 13˚ clockwise around the helical axis with modest packing adjustments accommodating a minor flattening of the rhomboid unit cell . This results in a slightly narrower filament ~ 23 . 6 nm in diameter with a hollow inner lumen diameter of ~ 12 . 5 nm . Overall , the Vipp1 Da 6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 structures reveal how subtle shifts in Vipp1 assembly and lattice packing modulate 39 inherent polymer stability .

Cells were grown on LB - agarose with ampicillin ( 100 µg / ml ) . 2xYT media was inoculated and cells grown at 37°C until induction at OD600 = 0 . 6 with 1 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Cells were grown for 16 hours at 19°C and shaken at 200 rpm . All following steps were carried out at 4°C unless otherwise specified . Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 5 , 500mM NaCl , 0 . 1mg / ml DNase - I and Roche cOmplete™ EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail and sonicated on ice . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16 , 000 x g for 20 mins . The supernatant was incubated with 20 ml amylose resin ( NEB ) pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer for 15 mins before loading onto a gravity flow column . Resin was washed with three column 46 volumes ( CV ) of wash buffer ( 50mM HEPES - NaOH pH 8 . 4 , 200mM NaCl ) , two CV of ATP - wash buffer ( 50mM HEPES - NaOH pH 8 . 0 , 80mM KCl , 2 . 5mM MgCl 2 and 5mM ATP ) , followed by two CV of wash buffer . Sample was eluted with wash buffer supplemented with 15 mM maltose . Peak fractions were pooled and incubated with TEV initially at 34°C for two hours followed by 48 hours at room temperature . Digested samples were dialysed ( 12 - 14 kDa cut - off ) overnight in size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) buffer containing 25mM HEPES - NaOH pH 8 . 4 , 10 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 except for Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 where 25mM HEPES - NaOH pH 8 . 4 , 10mM NaCl was used . Samples were passed over a 10 ml Ni - NTA bead gravity flow column pre - equilibrated with SEC buffer to remove His - tagged MBP and TEV in the column . Vipp1 was collected from the flow through and concentrated using Vivaspin - 20 concentrators with 10 kDa cut - off . During this process , sample was iteratively diluted with SEC buffer to avoid high protein concentrations in imidazole . Samples were injected onto a Sephacryl 16 / 60 S - 500 pre - equilibrated with SEC buffer . Gel filtration yielded three peaks . The first peak after the void volume at ~ 0 . 3 CV contained Vipp1 helical polymers used in this study , the second peak at ~ 0 . 4 - 0 . 7 CV was predominantly populated with rings , and the third peak at ~ 0 . 75 - 0 . 9 CV comprised Vipp1 monomer or small oligomers , MBP and TEV . For exclusive purification of Vipp1 rings HS , a protocol with high salt ( 50 mM ) in the SEC buffer was used as described previously 1 . Lipid - covered silica beads preparation . For fluorescent light microscopy ( FLM ) studies , lipid lamellae were deposited on 40 µm silica beads as previously described 61 . Briefly , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( DOPS ) , and ( 1 , 2 - Dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine labeled with Atto 647N ) Atto - 647DOPE were mixed at a ratio of 59 . 95 : 40 : 0 . 05 mol % , respectively , from lipid stocks in chloroform to a final lipid concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml . The lipid mixture was then dried in a vacuum for at least two hours to completely remove the chloroform , forming a dried lipid film , followed by hydration and resuspension in a buffer containing 1 mM HEPES - NaOH at pH 7 . 4 . Subsequently , 1 µL of 40 µm silica beads ( Microspheres - Nanospheres ) was mixed with 10 µL of the hydrated lipid mixture and then divided into five drops placed on a parafilm surface . Subsequently , these beads - lipid drops were dried in a vacuum for at least 30 mins until the complete evaporation of the aqueous buffer . 47 Supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) preparation . For FLM studies , SLBs were prepared as previously described 62 . Briefly , a coverslip was cleaned by sonication in water , ethanol , and water for 10 mins each , followed by 30 seconds of plasma cleaning ( Harrick Plasma ) . After plasma cleaning , an Ibidi chamber ( sticky - Slide VI 0 . 4 ) was mounted on the coverslip , and each of the wells was filled with 200 µL of buffer ( 25mM HEPES - NaOH , pH 8 . 3 , 1mM EDTA , and 10 or 500 mM NaCl depending on the experiment ) . To form the SLBs , a portion of the lipid - covered silica beads was transferred to each well using a glass pipette , leading to the spilling of the lipid bilayers on the coverslip . The fluorescently labeled protein was introduced in the assays by replacing 100 µL buffer with new buffer containing the protein at desired concentration in the final volume of 200 µL . Large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) preparation . For F - AFM studies , LUVs were prepared using either E . coli total lipid extract ( Avanti ) or 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( DOPS ) mixed at a ratio of 60 : 40 mol % . Both lipid mixes were tested with Vipp1 and similar polymers observed assembling including sheets , spirals and rings . Therefore , for the F - AFM results presented in this study E . coli total lipid extract was subsequently used to maintain consistency with EM monolayer studies . Lipids dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol ( 1 : 1 ) were dried under N 2 flux followed by overnight incubation in a vacuum oven at 37°C . Afterwards , lipids were fully rehydrated with buffer containing 25mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 4 for 10 mins at room temperature , obtaining a 0 . 8 mg / mL lipid solution . The lipid suspension was vortexed for 30 seconds and freeze – thawed five times in liquid nitrogen and a water - bath . Mica - SLBs were then prepared by depositing LUVs onto freshly cleaved mica placed on the imaging chamber and incubating for 20 mins at 37°C with 10 mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 4 , 10mM CaCl 2 , and 2mM MgCl 2 . Samples were rinsed thoroughly by buffer containing 25mM HEPES - NaOH pH 7 . 4 with or without 150 mM NaCl for samples in high salt and low salt conditions , respectively . A final volume of 300µL of these buffers for their respective conditions was added into the imaging chamber . FLM image and movie acquisition . For the FLM studies , Vipp1 was chemically labelled at the N - terminus with TFP - AlexaFluor - 488 ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) following the labelling procedure provided by the manufacturer . Fluorescence image acquisition was performed using an inverted spinning disc microscope assembled by 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovation ) , 48 consisting of a Nikon base ( Eclipse C1 , Nikon ) , a 100x 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective , and an EVOLVE EM - CCD camera ( Roper Scientific ) . The plugin Turboreg 63 and a custom - written ImageJ macro were used for X - Y drift correction . Fast Scan AFM image acquisition . A JPK NanoWizard Ultraspeed AFM ( Bruker and JPK BioAFM ) equipped with USC - F0 . 3 - k0 . 3 - 10 cantilevers with spring constant of 0 . 3N nm −1 , resonance frequency of about 300 kHz ( Nanoworld ) , was used for image acquisition . The F - AFM was operated in tapping mode , where the cantilever oscillated at a frequency proximal to 150kHz . Here , both topographic and phase images were reported . Initially , the supported lipid bilayer was imaged before selecting and imaging the area of interests ( AOIs ) . While imaging of the AOIs was ongoing , Vipp1 , Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 or Vipp1 F197K / L200K samples were injected into the imaging chamber at 3 . 5 - 7 µM or 21 µM for Vipp1 rings HS in the final volume with either high or low salt buffer as described above in the LUV preparation . Images were analysed with JPKSPM Data Processing , ImageJ , and WSxM software 64 . Negative stain electron microscopy ( NS EM ) and data collection . To visualise Vipp1 , 4 µL of 6 µM sample was spotted onto plasma cleaned carbon - coated EM grids ( 300 - mesh , Agar Scientific ) and incubated for 1 min . The samples were blotted , washed with water , and stained twice with two drops of 2 % uranyl acetate . Images were acquired on a FEI Tecnai 12 electron microscope equipped with a TVIPS 4K CMOS XF416 camera . Vipp1 monolayer assay and image analysis . Monolayer assays were performed following methods previously outlined 1 but modified in buffer composition and lipid drop size . E . coli total lipid extract ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) was used to prepare the lipid monolayers . Wells ( 4 mm diameter ) in a custom - built Teflon block were filled with 50 µL of assay buffer ( 25mM HEPES - NaOH , pH 8 . 4 , 5mM KCl , and 5mM MgCl 2 ) and a 3 µL drop of 0 . 1 mg / ml lipid dissolved in chloroform was gently applied on top and allowed to evaporate for one hour . Carbon - coated EM grids ( 200 - mesh , Agar Scientific ) without plasma cleaning or glow discharge were placed on the lipid layer with the carbon side facing the lipid . 15 µM Vipp1 was added through a side port and mixed gently with the buffer beneath the lipid layer . Control wells without protein or with protein - only ( chloroform drop without lipid ) were included . The assays were incubated for one hour , and grids were subsequently removed , stained and imaged on a 49 Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope . Datasets containing 136 and 139 images for Vipp1 and Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 , respectively , were collected at 2 . 563 Å pixel size . The contrast transfer function ( CTF ) was estimated with CTFFIND - 4 . 1 65 . Filament segments were picked and extracted for three rounds of 2D classification in Relion4 66 . The final 2D class averages presented incorporated 1951 and 6902 segments for Vipp1 and Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 , respectively . Cryo - EM sample preparation and data collection . 3 . 5 µL of Vipp1 at a final concentration of 60 µM was incubated for 90 seconds on a plasma cleaned holey R2 / 2 Quantifoil copper grid ( Electron Microscopy Science ) before plunge freezing in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI ) set at 100 % humidity and 10°C . Cryo - EM data was collected at 300 kV on a Titan Krios equipped with a Gatan Quantum K2 Summit detector operated in super resolution mode with a pixel size of 0 . 536 Å . A total of 19 , 740 movies were acquired at a defocus range between 0 . 75 and 2 . 5 µM with a total electron dose of 50 e - / Å 2 fractionated over 50 frames and an exposure of 4 . 1 seconds . For Vipp1 F197K / L200K and Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 , cryo - EM data was collected at 300 kV on a Titan Krios microscope ( LonCEM , The Francis Crick Institute , London , UK ) equipped with a Gatan K3 detector operated in super resolution mode with a pixel size of 0 . 55 Å . A total of 30 , 216 and 29 , 562 micrographs were acquired at a defocus range between 0 . 75 and 2 . 5 µM with a total electron dose of 50 and 41 e - / Å 2 fractionated over 44 and 28 frames using 4 . 6 and 3 second exposures , respectively . Cryo - EM image processing and helical reconstruction of Vipp1 filaments . Micrograph movies were corrected for beam - induced sample motion and Fourier cropped to a pixel size of 1 . 072 Å for Vipp1 , or 1 . 1 Å for Vipp1 F197K / L200K and Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 using MotionCor2 67 . Contrast - transfer function ( CTF ) estimations were performed using CTFFIND - 4 . 1 . Filaments were boxed into overlapping particles using crYOLO 68 . Each particle box overlapped with its neighbour by 46 Å ( Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 , Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 ) or 44 Å ( Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 ) equivalent to the left - handed 5 - start or 4 - start helical pitches , respectively . Using Relion4 , this resulted in extraction of 138562 , 1172337 and 648059 particles with 504 pixel box size for Vipp1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K and Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 , respectively . Particles were then binned by a factor of three and imported into cryoSPARC 69 for iterative rounds of 2D classification . Low quality particles were discarded , and remaining particles sorted into separate bins based on their Fourier Transform . Attempts to determine helical symmetry parameters based on C1 reconstructions 50 yielded only low quality reconstructions without meaningful symmetries . Only Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 symmetry particle class averages gave a Fourier Transform with non - overlapping layer lines amenable to indexing ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . This gave a grid of possible symmetries which were systematically tested using helical refinement in Cryosparc . The helical parameters that yielded a reconstruction showing obvious secondary structure features were used for next steps in Relion4 . This reconstruction also served as a subsequent initial reference map . For all other symmetries including Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 , particle class averages gave Fourier Transforms with overlapping layer lines that impeded indexing . Initial helical parameters were therefore determined by calculating and screening a grid of theoretical lattices close to Vipp1 Da 6 _ L3 symmetry . Cleaned stacks containing 64936 , 508377 , 91126 and 57329 particles relating to Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 , Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 were exported from Cryosparc and re - extracted in Relion using a 150 pixel box size so that particles remained binned by a factor of three . Iterative rounds of 3D classification were undertaken resulting in final particle stacks of 43480 , 36652 , 38361 and 38585 relating to Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 , Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 . Particles were re - extracted with no binning using a 450 pixel box size for iterative rounds of 3D autorefinement incorporating three rounds of CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing . For these steps a mask covering the central 30 % of the map was used . Final refinements for Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 , Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 converged with helical rises of 2 . 372 , 2 . 440 , 2 . 155 and 2 . 159 Å , and helical twists of - 75 . 860˚ , - 75 . 835˚ , 68 . 507˚ and 85 . 495˚ , respectively . Final resolutions of 3 . 7 , 3 . 7 , 3 . 8 and 3 . 7 Å were based on gold standard Fourier shell correlations ( FSC ) = 0 . 143 . Vipp1 L1 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 maps were sharpened using DeepEMhancer 59 wideTarget model , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 was sharpened using Relion4 postprocess with B - factor - 110 . 719 Å 2 , whilst Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 used Phenix 70 auto _ sharpen with B - factor - 183 . 9 Å 2 . Map local resolution was estimated using ResMap 71 . Model building and refinement . A monomer extracted from Vipp1 C14 symmetry ring ( PDB code 6ZW4 ) was fitted into Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 as an initial build template . High quality map with generally excellent side chain detail facilitated manual building and modelling in Coot 72 and ISOLDE 73 . By applying the helical parameters to this asymmetric unit , a helical filament was generated in ChimeraX 1 . 4 74 . A central subunit was chosen and all subunits that were not within 5 Å of this central subunit deleted . This assembly that comprised 19 subunits ( termed 51 19 - mer ) was then used for model building with the central subunit now modelled in the context of its neighbours . At the end of this iteration , the central subunit was extracted and a new helical filament and 19 - mer generated . This 19 - mer was used for real - space refinement in Phenix after which a new 19 - mer was generated again using the central subunit . This model building process was iterated with the same workflow utilised for Vipp1 L1 , Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 . In the lower resolution regions of Vipp1 L1 and Vipp1 Δα6 _ L2 maps where side chain detail was reduced or absent , side chains were modelled based on Vipp1 Δα6 _ L3 and Vipp1 F197K / L200K _ L1 structures . Final refinement and model validation statistics are in Table S1 . Cryo - ET sample preparation , data collection and image processing . 5 nm gold fiducials without BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were mixed with 60 µM Vipp1Δα6 1 - 219 sample . 3 . 5 µL of this mix was incubated on plasma cleaned holey R2 / 2 Quantifoil copper 200 mesh grids for 90 seconds at 10°C and vitrified as for cryo - EM samples . Tomograms were collected at 300 kV on a Titan Krios electron microscope ( LonCEM , UK ) equipped with a Gatan K3 detector with pixel size of 2 . 257 Å . Dose - symmetric tilt series were acquired between - 60° to + 60° with 3° intervals and a defocus range between 3 - 6 µm . A total accumulated dose of 101 . 6 e - / Å 2 was fractionated over 15 frames per tilt using an exposure of 5 . 6 seconds . Tilt series movies were corrected for beam - induced sample motion using MotionCor2 67 . Using IMOD 75 , the tilt - series was 5 - binned to yield a pixel size = 11 . 3 Å , aligned and reconstructed using a SIRT algorithm .
