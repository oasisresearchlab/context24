Ohira Division of Biochemistry , Chiba Cancer Center , Chiba , Japan Received : May 18 , 1998 / Accepted July 13 , 1998 Abstract Huntington disease ( HD ) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder which is associated with CAG expansion in the coding region of the gene for huntingtin protein . Recently , a huntingtin interacting protein , HIP1 , was isolated by the yeast two - hybrid system . Here we report the isolation of a cDNA clone for HIP1R ( huntingtin inter - acting protein - 1 related ) , which encodes a predicted protein product sharing a striking homology with HIP1 . RT - PCR analysis showed that the messenger RNA was ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues . Based on PCR - assisted analysis of a radiation hybrid panel and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization , HIP1R was localized to the q24 region of chromosome 12 . Key words Huntingtin interacting protein ( HIP1 ) · Leucine zipper · Chromosome 12q24 · Full - length enriched cDNA library · Neuroblastoma Introduction Huntington disease ( HD ) is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease that gives rise to progressive , selective neural cell death associated with choreic movements and dementia ( Harper 1991 ) . The disease is associated with in - creases in the CAG triplet repeat length present in a gene called huntingtin located on chromosome 4p16 . 3 ( Ross et al . 1995 ; Zoghbi et al . 1996 ) . In HD , CAG expansion beyond 35 repeats usually results in a clinical phenotype ( HDCRG 1993 ; Kremer et al . 1994 ) . There is a strong inverse relation - ship between CAG size and age of onset of this disease ( Andrew et al . 1993 ; Duyao et al . 1993 ; Snell et al . 1993 ) . Wanker et al . ( 1997 ) hypothesized that binding proteins , with a restricted pattern of expression , speciﬁc to the elon - gated polyglutamine stretch of the huntingtin protein , could cause selective vulnerability in particular cells . At present , three huntingtin interacting proteins have been identiﬁed , such as huntingtin - associated protein ( Li et al . 1995 ) , the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH ( Burke et al . 1996 ) , and the ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme hE2 - 25K , also named HIP2 ( Kalchman et al . 1996 ) . Recently , another huntingtin inter - acting protein , HIP1 , was isolated by yeast two - hybrid screening . HIP1 shares homology with Sla2p , a component of cytoskeleton in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Kalchman et al . 1997 ; Wanker et al . 1997 ) . In the present study , cDNA for a HIP1 - related protein ( HIP1R ) was cloned from a full - length enriched cDNA library constructed from a neuroblastoma sample using the oligo - capping method as described previously ( Maruyama and Sugano 1994 ; Suzuki et al . 1997 ) . Here we report the sequence feature , expression proﬁle , and chromosomal as - signment of the HIP1R gene . Results and discussion The HIP1R cDNA clone was revealed from a one - pass sequence to be the most homologous to HIP1 ( accession number U79734 ) . The entire sequence of this clone was determined by a shot - gun strategy ( Seki et al . 1997 ) . The isolated HIP1R cDNA clone was 3876bp in length and had a single ORF of 890 amino acids . The predicted protein had a calculated molecular weight of approximately 99kDa . The nucleotide sequence data reported here will appear in the DDBJ , EMBL , and GenBank nucleotide sequence data - bases with the accession number of AB013384 .

Matsuda et al . : EGF receptor and osteoblastic differentiation Fig . 2 Primers used for RT - PCR were to amplify the 425bp cDNA of the transcript . The primers were ( 5 9 - GAAATGCTCCGCTCTGAA - CTG - 3 9 ) and ( 5 9 - AACTCCGACTCCCGCTTCACC - 3 9 ) . The primer set gave the longer PCR product from genomic DNA which was easily distinguished from the 425bp product from the mRNA . The templates of the human tissues of poly ( A ) 1 RNAs were purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA , USA ) . The cDNA templates for RT - PCR were syn - thesized from 2 (cid:237) g of poly ( A ) 1 using excess amounts of Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Gibco BRL , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) and ran - dom hexamer primers . PCR was carried out in a ﬁnal volume of 10 (cid:237) l containing 1 3 LA - PCR buffer ( Takara , Kyoto , Japan ) , 2 (cid:237) M each primer , 200 (cid:237) M each dNTP , 1 (cid:237) l of template DNA and 0 . 01 units of LA - Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara , Kyoto , Japan ) . Temperature and time schedule were 30 cycles of 95 (cid:176) C for 20s and 62 (cid:176) C for 1min . PCR products were separated on 2 . 5 % Nusieve GTG agarose gel ( FMC , Rockland , ME , USA ) with a 1kb ladder DNA marker ( Gibco ) polyadenylation signal , AATAAA , was located 23bp up - stream of a poly A . Homology search of the conceptual translated amino acid sequence of the isolated cDNA re - vealed that it was most homologous to HIP1 ( Kalchman et al . 1997 ) , having 56 % identity at the amino acid level , and thus we named the gene for the cDNA huntingtin interact - ing protein - related ( HIP1R ) . The alignment of the pre - dicted amino acid sequences of HIP1 , HIP1R , and Sla2p is shown in Fig . 1 . A homology search for HIP1 revealed that the HIP1 gene product shares signiﬁcant similarity with the Sla2 gene product from S . cerevisiae , which is known to code for an essential cytoskeletal - associated protein ( Kalchman et al . 1997 ; Wanker et al . 1997 ) . Kalchman et al . ( 1997 ) suggested that an increased polyglutamine tract could disturb the normal interaction of huntingtin with HIP1 which , in turn , could lead to an alteration of biological events on the membrane causing premature cell death and ultimately the clinical manifestations of HD . Since HIP1R has a high sequence homology to HIP1 in the amino terminal region , which was shown to be respon - sible for the interaction with huntingtin ( Wanker et al . 1997 ) , it is conceivable although not proven that HIP1R also interacts with huntingtin in its amino terminal region . Our sequence analysis revealed a highly conserved motif consistent with a leucine zipper encompassing the amino acid residues 329 – 357 ( LEEKSDQLEKLKRELEAKAG - ELARAQEAL ) of HIP1R . In HIP1 and Sla2p , a leucine zipper motif is found at the region of amino acid residues 412 – 433 ( LESLKQELGTSQRELQVLQGSL ) and 481 – 502 ( LAKLYSQLRQEHLNLLPRFKKL ) , respectively . Leucine zippers are known to mediate protein - protein interactions occurring in the cytoskeleton , or to act in transcriptional activations by allowing the formation of homo - or hetero - dimers of transcription - regulating proteins ( John et al . 1994 ; Pearlman et al . 1994 ) . The leucine zipper motifs conserved among the HIP1 family could con - tribute to some important role ( s ) in interaction with other proteins . We examined the tissue distribution of HIP1R transcript in various tissues by reverse transcription - coupled poly - merase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . Primers used for RT - PCR correspond to the coding region of the gene . Considering its ubiquitous expression in a wide variety of human tissues ( Fig . 2 ) , HIP1R described in the present study seems to be involved in a basic housekeeping function of cells . We determined the chromosomal location of the HIP1R gene using a radiation hybrid panel ( Genebridge 4 , Re - search Genetics , Huntsville , AL , USA ) in the same manner of previous reports ( Saito et al . 1997 ; Seki et al . 1997 ) . Primers used for PCR ampliﬁcation correspond to the 3 9 UTR region of the gene ( 5 9 - CCTGAAGGTCGTGGA - TGGATG - 3 9 ) and ( 5 9 - CTGGTAGAATCGGTGCCC - CAG - 3 9 ) ( 102 - bp PCR product ) . The radiation hybrid mapping data was processed using the RHMAPPER software package ( http : / / www - genome . wi . mit . edu / cgi - bin / contig / rhmapper . pl ) . The data vector for the HIP1R gene was 0010100001 1000100000 0100100101 0001010010 0000110000 1000000000 0000001010 1001100000 0100011010 110 and the consequent statistical report indicated the gene was mapped to 4 . 81cR distal from WI - 6021 ( lod . 3 . 0 ) which maps cytogenetically to the 12q24 region . To conﬁrm the PCR - based chromosome mapping by an independent approach , we performed ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) using a P1 phage DNA probe as described previ - ously ( Seki et al . 1997 ) . The P1 clone containing the HIP1R sequence was isolated by the method described previously ( Ohira et al . 1997 ) . The clear doublet signals were consis - tently demonstrated on the q24 . 2 – q24 . 3 region of chro - mosome 12 ( Fig . 3 ) . Therefore , the gene was mapped on the q24 . 2 – q24 . 3 region of chromosome 12 . Some of the neurodegenerative disease was mapped to the vicinity of this region including scapuloperoneal syndromes ( Isozumi et al . 1996 ) , the distal hereditary motor neuropathy ( distal HMN ) or the spinal form of Charcot - Marie - Tooth ( CMT ) disease ( Timmerman et al . 1996 ) . Homology between HIP1R and HIP1 implies the possible involvement of HIP1R in these neurodegenerative diseases . Our precise chromosomal positioning data of the HIP1R gene might contribute to the ongoing positional candidate approaches for the disease genes which are linked to the genomic region . B .
