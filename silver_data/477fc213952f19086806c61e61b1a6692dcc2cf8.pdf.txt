Solvent - based printing leads to the spontaneous formation of micropores on the scaffold’s sur - face upon solvent removal , without the need for further post processing . Our aim is to create and characterize porous scaf - folds using a new formulation composed of mechanically stable poly ( lactic - co - glycol acid ) and osteoconductive b - tricalcium phosphate with and without the addition of elastic thermoplas - tic polyurethane prepared by solvent - based 3D - printing technique . Large - scale regenerative scaffolds can be 3D - printed with adequate ﬁdelity and show porosity at multiple levels analysed via micro - computer tomography , scanning electron microscopy and N 2 sorption . Superior mechanical properties compared to a com - mercially available calcium phosphate ink are demonstrated in compression and screw pull out tests . Biological assessments includ - ing cell activity assay and live - dead staining prove the scaffold’s cytocompatibility . Osteoconductive properties are demonstrated by performing an osteogenic differentiation assay with primary human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells . We propose a versa - tile fabrication process to create porous 3D - printed scaffolds with adequate mechanical stability and osteoconductivity , both impor - tant characteristics for segmental mandibular bone reconstruction . Keywords : solvent - based printing ; porosity ; regenerative scaffold ; osteogenesis ; mesenchymal stromal cells Introduction Trauma , tumour , infection and congenital malformation are among the main causes of large segmental mandibular defects , which require a complex surgical procedure for successful func - tional and aesthetic reconstruction [ 1 ] . The current standard of care ( SOC ) is autologous bone grafting from either the iliac crest or the fibula [ 2 ] , which is associated with several drawbacks such as limited tissue availability , donor site morbidity , lack of patient - specific graft geometry and excessive resorption . To im - prove patient care , an effective alternative is required ideally overcoming the aforementioned disadvantages . The replacement of the current SOC should be a product that not only possesses mechanical stability enabling fixation with a plate - screw system and biological properties such as biocompatibility , biodegradabil - ity and osteoconductivity , but it should also provide practical advantages such as simple , cost - effective and versatile biofabri - cation process . 3D printing is a powerful fabrication tool enabling the creation of patient - specific and mechanically stable scaffolds in a cost - and time - effective manner . A very common printing approach is fused deposition modelling ( FDM ) that involves heat - melting and deposition of thermoplastic polymers , such as polycaprolactone ( PCL ) or polylactic acid ( PLA ) [ 3 ] . However , they degrade at tem - peratures higher than 200 (cid:2) C [ 4 ] and have been shown to undergo a 48 % reduction of PLA average molecular weight after printing at 186 (cid:2) C [ 5 ] . This degradation is detrimental for the performance of the 3D - printed scaffold [ 6 , 7 ] . Additionally , FDM printing requires the use of a filament , which makes the combination of osteoconductive calcium phosphate ( CaP ) material or other com - pounds tedious and requires a pre - processing step involving melt - blending extruding to create a filament composed of the Received : May 22 , 2023 .

Finally , FDM printing of PLA is associated with the formation of an undesirable smooth surface topography [ 13 , 14 ] . Surface microroughness and porosity are both important features for protein adsorption , cell adhesion and tissue infiltration for enhanced osteogenesis [ 15 – 17 ] . A variety of postprocessing surface modification strategies can be applied to improve these features such as plasma treatment , coating or pro - tein grafting [ 18 – 20 ] . An elegant printing alternative to FDM is low - temperature solvent - based printing . Ink components are easily mixed , avoiding extreme temperatures and consequent degradation , to create a 3D printable blend . The post - printing re - moval of the solvent spontaneously leads to the creation of micropores on the surface of the scaffold , beneficial for cell adhe - sion and osteogenesis [ 16 ] without the need of further chemical surface modifications [ 21 , 22 ] . Our aim is to fabricate a micro - porous scaffold prepared by a newly developed solvent - based 3D - printing technique for bone tissue engineering purposes . To replace commonly used toxic or - ganic solvents , we used water - soluble and non - toxic ethylene carbonate ( EC ) . To demonstrate the versatility of the method , we modulated material properties by creating a composite made of poly ( lactic - co - glycol acid ) ( PLGA ) , for printability and mechanical strength , b - tricalcium phosphate ( b - TCP ) for osteoconductivity , with and without the addition of thermoplastic polyurethane ( TPU ) , which is known to be biodegradable [ 23 , 24 ] and elastic [ 25 ] , and subsequently characterized the material properties . Increasing the elastic properties of biomaterials can be beneficial for the mandibular bone repair regarding the mandible’s chewing function . As a control , the newly developed inks were compared with a commercially available 3D printable CaP ceramic , OsteoInk V R . In this study , we report an advanced low - temperature solvent - based printing approach to develop a versatile , medically relevant manufacturing process that allows fabrication of patient - specific regenerative bone substitutes for bone defect repair . Materials and methods Human bone marrow aspirates are obtained with informed con - sent of all donors and with full approval from the Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg Medical Centre ( EK - Freiburg : 135 / 14 , 25 March 2014 ) and the ethical commission of Zu¨rich ( KEK - ZH - NR : 2016 - 00141 ) . All reagents are purchased from Sigma - Aldrich unless otherwise stated . An overview of the methods is reported in Figure 1 . Preparation of PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU ink TPU ( ROLASERIT V R , AM Polymers GmbH ) powder is dissolved in EC at 120 (cid:2) C using a hot plate stirrer and a rotor mixing system . After cooling the hot plate stirrer to 90 (cid:2) C , PLGA ( PURASORB V R PLG 8531 , 85 / 15L - lactic / Glycolide , Corbion , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) pow - der is added and mixed until dissolution . Subsequently , the sys - tem is cooled to 80 (cid:2) C , b - TCP powder ( BABI - TCP - N100 , Berkeley Advanced Biomaterials ) is added , and the blend stirred overnight using a Hei - TORQUE Expert 200 ( Heidolph Instruments ) set to 30rpm to obtain a viscous , homogenous ink . The ink is trans - ferred to 3cc syringe barrels ( Nordson EFD ) and kept at (cid:3) 20 (cid:2) C un - til printing . Two ink formulations , PLGA / b - TCP (cid:3) TPU ( without TPU ) denoted as group 1 ( G1 ) and PLGA / b - TCP þ TPU ( addition of TPU ) denoted as group 2 ( G2 ) , are prepared and the ratio between individual components is presented in Table 1 . Rheological characterization of the inks Viscoelastic properties of the inks are investigated using an Anton Paar MCR - 302 rheometer ( Anton Paar ) . Oscillatory and ro - tational tests are performed using a flat - plate geometry with the gap set at 0 . 5mm . An amplitude sweep test is carried out with strain ranging between 0 . 01 % and 100 % at constant angular ve - locity of 10rad / s and a temperature of 80 (cid:2) C . Viscosity is evalu - ated using a frequency sweep test ( N ¼ 3 ) between 0 . 1 and 100Hz , with a constant strain of 1 % based on the amplitude test and a temperature of 80 (cid:2) C .

Storage mod - ulus ( G 0 ) and loss modulus ( G 00 ) values are acquired for all tests . Design of 3D - printed scaffolds Two different scaffold structures are used in this study and designed using BioCAD software ( RegenHU ) . Design 1 is round and has a porous grid structure . Design 2 is a round dense disc with only two layers and can be press - fit into 24 - well - plates , es - pecially practical for cell seeding . Using the discs ( Design 2 ) for cell experiments allows for higher standardization of cell seeding and attachment on top of the biomaterial compared to the Design 1 , which can lead to uneven cell - attachment starting point between groups . Scaffold dimensions and corresponding measurement are summarized in Table 2 . Solvent - based 3D printing and postprocessing of PLGA / TCP 6 TPU and Osteoink V R Scaffold fabrication Low - temperature solvent - based 3D printing is performed using 3D Discovery V R bioprinter ( RegenHU ) . Ink - laden cartridges are equipped with a stainless steel needle with a 0 . 5 - mm inner diam - eter and a piston . During printing the cartridge heater is set at 80 (cid:2) C and a pressure between 0 . 5 and 1 . 8 bars is applied for the different groups . The velocity of the print head is 4mm / s , and the layer height is set at 0 . 4mm . The ink is extruded onto a dry glass slide which is mounted onto an aluminium cool plate with the temperature kept between 3 (cid:2) C and 10 (cid:2) C . The printing of the com - mercially available Osteoink V R ( RegenHu ) is performed at room temperature onto a glass slide using the same needle size , pres - sure , print head velocity and layer height . Postprocessing To remove the solvent , the 3D - printed PLGA / b (cid:3) TCP 6 ( TPU ) scaffolds are placed first in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24h and then in a water bath at 37 (cid:2) C for 48h ( 4 (cid:4) Milli - Q V R water changes ) . Scaffolds are then air dried and stored at room temperature until further use . 3D - printed discs ( Design 2 ) are size - fitted for a 96 - well - plate and 48 - well - plate using a hollow punch with a dimension of 7mm and 11mm in diameter , respec - tively . The discs are sterilized using a cold ethylene oxide gas pro - tocol , degassed under vacuum for at least 5days , and press - fit into the cell - culture wells under sterile conditions prior to use . 3D - printed Osteoink V R scaffolds are hardened post - printing using a steam autoclave ( Belimed Infection Control , Belimed Sauter AG ) as previously described [ 26 ] . Post - printing solvent removal confirmation To verify complete removal of the solvent , the 3D - printed scaf - folds ( Design 1 ) are dried and weighed during the extraction pro - cess after 0 , 24 and 48h ( N ¼ 3 ) . 1H nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) is carried out to further confirm complete solvent removal using Bruker Avance AV - 500 18MHz NMR spectrometer . Prior to measurement , 10 – 30mg / ml of scaffolds are dissolved in tri - chloromethane / chloroform ( Carl Roth GmbH ) for 3h on a spin - ning wheel , centrifuged and the supernatants transferred into NMR tubes . The presence of EC is defined by the peak at 4 . 541ppm of the four hydrogen protons . Micro - computed tomography Visualization of 3D - printed scaffolds is performed via micro - computed tomography ( m CT ) using vivaCT 40 ( SCANCO Medical AG ) with 45 kVp voltage , 177 l A current and 10 . 5 l m isotropic voxel size . Printing porosity of 3D - printed scaffolds is calculated using the Amira image processing software ( V . 6 . 4 . 0 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) ( N ¼ 3 ) . A standardized image processing protocol is used . Firstly , the scaffold is segmented and using a filling algorithm , the inside of the segmentation is de - fined , leaving the total volume of the scaffold and the inside seg - mented . The scaffold is segmented again and combined with the total volume mask . With the combined mask , the scaffold’s po - rosity is calculated as a percentage of the total volume divided by the volume of the scaffold mask . Scanning electron microscopy Surface topography of 3D - printed scaffolds ( Design 1 ) is visual - ized using a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) ( Hitachi SU 5000 ) . Upon solvent extraction , scaffolds are mounted onto stubs using carbon conductive cement Leit - C , dried overnight and sub - sequently sputter coated with a layer of platinum / palladium us - ing CCU - 010 Metal Sputter Coater ( Safematic ) . SEM images are taken at 3kV voltage , 10mA beam current and a working dis - tance of 5 and 50mm for surface images and overview images , respectively . Quantification of surface porosity is based on the close - up surface images and obtained using ImageJ software ( N ¼ 7 ) . N 2 sorption Mesoporous properties ( 2 – 50nm ) 24 of 3D - printed scaffolds ( Design 1 ) are determined via nitrogen ( N 2 ) sorption using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 ( Instrument Corp . ) under liquid N 2 ( (cid:3) 195 . 8 (cid:2) C ) . Scaffolds ( ca . 0 . 5g ) are degassed at room temperature under vacuum for 48h prior to measurement . Specific surface area ( SSA ) and desorption average pore width ( 4V / A ) values are Table 1 .

Degradation / swelling test To investigate degradation and swelling , Design 1 3D - printed scaffolds ( N ¼ 6 ) are placed individually in a well of a 6 - well - plate and incubated in 5ml phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 28days at 37 (cid:2) C under constant shaking . Beforehand , the weight of the scaffolds is measured in dry state , which is used as the normal - izer . Wet scaffolds are measured at day 1 , 7 , 14 and 28 . After the incubation period , the scaffolds are air dried for 2days and the weight is measured in dry state . The pH of the PBS is measured at day 1 , 7 , 14 and 28 to identify possible reduction caused by scaf - fold degradation . Compression test Mechanical compression tests ( Design 1 , G1 and G2 : N ¼ 14 , Osteoink : N ¼ 13 ) of pre - wetted 3D - printed scaffolds are per - formed using Instron 5866 ( Instron ) equipped with a 1 - kN load cell . The compression test is divided into two parts : ( i ) four loading - unloading cycles at the rate of 1 % / s to 15 or 8 % compres - sive strain are applied to the PLGA / TCP 6 TPU and the Osteoink V R scaffolds respectively , and the slope from the linear region of the stress – strain curve of the fourth cycle is taken to calculate the Young’s modulus ; ( ii ) subsequent ultimate test using a speed of 0 . 1 % / s until a strain of 50 % to break the scaffold and measure yield strain , yield stress and toughness at yield . Screw pull - out test Screw pull out tests of 3D - printed scaffolds ( Design 1 ) are per - formed using Instron 5866 equipped with a 50 - N load cell ( N ¼ 12 ) . Prewetted scaffolds are divided into two groups : ( i ) no pre - drilling is applied ; ( ii ) scaffolds are pre - drilled using 1 . 8mm drill head ( DePuy Synthes ) . An 18mm ‘MatrixMANDIBLE’ screw ( DePuy Synthes ) with diameter of 2mm is screwed into the scaf - folds . The screw is installed in a custom - made screw holder that is connected to the load cell , placed into a chamber with a slot and pulled out with a velocity of 0 . 25mm / s and the maximum force during testing is recorded . Cell culture of L929 fibroblasts L929 fibroblasts ( 85011425 , mouse C3H / An connective tissue , Sigma ) are cryopreserved according to the company’s instruc - tions in liquid nitrogen . Upon thawing , 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells are seeded in a T300 flask ( cell density 3 . 33 (cid:4) 10 3 cells / cm 2 ) for culture expansion . The expansion medium ( EM ) consists of low glucose ( 1g / l ) - DMEM ( LG - DMEM ) ( Gibco , Carlsbad ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) foetal bovine serum ( Corning ) and 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin ( PEN / STREP ) ( Gibco ) . Cells are cultured under standard cell culture conditions of 37 (cid:2) C with 5 % CO 2 and 90 % humidity with three media changes per week . Cell isolation and culture of human bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stromal cells Isolation and cryopreservation of human bone marrow mesen - chymal stromal cells ( hBM - MSCs ) from bone marrow aspirates is performed as described previously [ 27 ] , as well as cell culture ex - pansion as described previously [ 28 ] . hBM - MSC donor details are as follows : Donor A , 52 - year old female , spine vertebral body as - pirate , Donor B , 51 - year old female , spine vertebral body aspirate ; Donor C , 48 - year old female , spine vertebral body aspirate ; Donor D , 74 - year old female , spine vertebral body aspirate ; Donor E , 44 - year old male , iliac crest cancellous bone . Indirect cytotoxicity test via CellTiter - Blue V R The indirect toxicity test of 3D - printed scaffolds ( Design 1 ) is car - ried out according to the ISO 10993 guideline using the L929 fibro - blasts ( N ¼ 4 ) . Cells are harvested using 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco ) and seeded on 96 - well - plates at a density of 1 (cid:4) 10 4 cells / well in sic replicates . For the first 24h , cells are cultured in EM . In the meantime , 3D - printed scaffolds are incubated in EM in tripli - cates for 24h to obtain conditioned media ( CM1 - 3 ) . At this point ( day 0 ) , cells are switched into their corresponding culture media : ( i ) positive control : EM supplemented with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ; ( ii ) negative control : EM ; ( iii ) CM1 - 3 . CellTiter - Blue V R ( CTB ) is per - formed at day 1 and day 3 . Media are removed and EM supple - mented with 16 . 6 % ( v / v ) CTB reagent is added . After 4h of incubation at 37 (cid:2) C with 5 % CO 2 and 90 % humidity , the superna - tant is transferred into a 96 clear bottom well plate ( Corning , New York , USA ) and fluorescence is read at 560 / 590nm using Infinite V R 200 PRO plate reader ( Tecan Trading AG ) . DNA quantification and live / dead staining on 3D - printed discs hBM - MSCs are harvested using 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA and seeded at a density of 8 . 75 (cid:4) 10 3 cells / well ( 10 (cid:4) 10 3 cells / cm 2 ) in dupli - cates on either tissue culture plastic as control or onto 3D - printed discs ( Design 2 ) and cultured in EM . At day 1 and day 7 , DNA quantification is performed using the CyQuant TM Cell Proliferation Assay ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( N ¼ 3 ) . In short , cells are lysed with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 10mM TrisHCl for 2h at 4 (cid:2) C , cell lysate is transferred into a 96 clear bottom well plate , working solution containing dye is added and fluorescence is read at 490 / 530nm using Infinite V R 200 PRO plate reader . At day 1 and day 7 , cells are washed with PBS , stained with staining solution that contains 1 m M Calcein , AM ( Invitrogen ) and 1 m M Ethidium Homodimer - 1 ( Invitrogen ) in serum - free LG - DMEM and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C for 1h . The staining solution is rinsed with PBS and the cells are subsequently imaged using a confocal microscope ( LSM800 , Leica Microsystems ) . Alizarin red staining and quantification of 3D - printed discs 3D - printed discs ( Design 2 ) are stained with Alizarin red ( ScienCell Research Laboratories ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions ( N ¼ 3 ) . In short , the discs are incubated with 40mM Alizarin red solution for 1h at room temperature under gentle movement . The discs are washed with Milli - Q V R water until no discoloration is visible . The stained discs are imaged and incu - bated with 10 % ( v / v ) acetic acid for 30min at room temperature on an orbital shaker to extract the dye . The solution is transferred into Eppendorf tubes ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) , incubated for 10min at 85 (cid:2) C , cooled on ice for 5min and centrifuged at 20000 (cid:4) g for 15min at room temperature . 10 % ( v / v ) ammonium hydroxide is used to adjust the pH to 4 . 1 – 4 . 5 of the transferred supernatant . The absorbance at 405nm is measured using Infinite V R 200 PRO plate reader . Osteogenic assessment of hBM - MSCs cultured on G1 ( 2 TPU ) osteogenic differentiation hBM - MSCs are harvested using 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA and seeded at a density of 28 . 5 (cid:4) 10 3 cells / well ( 15 (cid:4) 10 3 cells / cm 2 ) in dupli - cates onto either coverslips ( SARSTEDT AG ) cultured in osteocon - trol medium ( EM ) or 3D - printed discs of G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) ( Design 2 ) and cultured either in osteocontrol—or osteogenic medium ( EM 4 | Regenerative Biomaterials , 2023 , Vol . 10 , rbad084 supplemented with 10nM dexamethasone , 5mM b - glycerophos - phate and 50 m g / ml L - ascorbic acid - 2 - phosphate ) for 28days un - der normal culture conditions ( N ¼ 2 ) . Quantification of alkaline phosphatase activity and DNA content At day 14 , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity is measured as de - scribed previously [ 28 ] . In short , after cell lysis with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 10mM TrisHCl , the enzymatic reaction is started by add - ing alkaline buffer solution , substrate solution ( 25mg / ml phos - phate substrate in 1mM diethanolamine ) and Milli - Q V R water and stopped by adding 0 . 1 M NaOH solution after 15min at 37 (cid:2) C . The absorbance is read at 405nm using the Infinite V R 200 PRO plate reader . ALP activity is normalized to the DNA content , which is performed as described in the previous section ( DNA Quantification and Live / Dead Staining on 3D - printed Discs ) . Staining of mineral deposition At day 28 , cells are fixed with 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 30min , permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 20min and stained with 2 m g / ml 4 0 , 6 - Diamidino - 2 - phenylindole solution for 10min with a PBS wash before each step . Mineral deposition is stained with OsteoImage TM Mineralization Assay ( Lonza ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and imaging is per - formed using a confocal microscope ( LSM800 , Leica Microsystems ) . RNA isolation and RT - qPCR Cells are harvested for gene expression analysis , RNA isolation at day 28 and real - time quantitative PCR is performed using the QuantStudio TM Flex Real - Time PCR System as described previ - ously [ 28 ] . Reverse transcription is performed using the Superscript Vilo cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the company’s instructions . Gene expressions of osteo - relevant markers : ALPL ( encodes for ALP ) , IBSP ( encodes for bone sialoprotein ) , SP7 ( encodes Osterix ) and SPP1 ( encodes Osteopontin ) are investigated . Primer sequences used are listed in Table 3 . The DD Ct method is applied for data analysis using RPLP0 as an endogenous normalizer and day 0 samples as a cali - brator . 3D printing of a patient - specific mandible defect - sized PLGA / b - TCP scaffold The self - created defect in the mandible SYNBONE V R is m CT - scanned using the vivaCT 40 . The defect geometry is exported as a STL . file using the Amira image processing software and con - verted into the g - code using the MM Converter software ( RegenHu ) . Solvent - based printing is applied to the PLGA / b - TCP ( G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) ) ink to create a patient - specific mandible defect - sized scaffold to demonstrate the precise printability of relevant defect sizes . Statistics Statistical analysis is performed using GraphPad Prism software version 9 . 3 . 1 ( GraphPad Software ) . An unpaired parametric test based on the Welch’s test , which assumes different standard de - viation is applied to the data of the printing porosity , surface po - rosity , gene expression and Alizarin red quantification . A one - way ANOVA is applied to the data of the Young’s modulus , yield stress—and strain . A two - way ANOVA is applied to the data of the peak displacement , screw pull - out test , DNA quantification and ALP activity . P - values higher than 0 . 05 are not significant and marked as ns . Results Both PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU inks demonstrate adequate rheological properties for 3D printing and superior printability compared to OsteoInk V R In the frequency sweep test , both inks remain viscous ( G 0 < G 00 ) with increasing frequency when the temperature and the ampli - tude is kept constant at 80 (cid:2) C and 1 % , respectively ( Figure 2A ) . G 0 values start at 5 6 1 . 1Pa and 12 6 6Pa and increase up to 9433 6 887Pa and 1480 6 10 4 Pa for G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) and G2 ( þ TPU ) , re - spectively . The addition of TPU decreases both the storage and loss modulus at frequencies higher than 0 . 25Hz . Temperature - dependent viscosity changes are measured using a temperature sweep test ( Figure 2B ) . Viscous behaviour ( G 0 < G 00 ) dominates for G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) ink with decreasing temperature , while for G2 ( þ TPU ) ink solid - like behaviour already starts to occur at 42 (cid:2) C . G 0 values start at 198 6 1 . 1Pa and 63 6 6 . 4Pa and increase up to ca . 1736 6 10 2 Pa and 2511 6 252Pa for G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) and G2 ( þ TPU ) , re - spectively . The addition of TPU accelerates solidification of the ink with decreasing temperatures ( Figure 2B ) . Rheologic characteristics of both inks display viscous behaviour at printing temperatures , which is important for successful printing . Printability is measured by investigating the maximum print - ing height until failure or artifact ( Figure 2C ) . Single line printing of G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) ink can be achieved up to 30mm without visual arti - facts , while with G2 ( þ TPU ) ink artifacts appear after a height of 25mm . OsteoInk V R shows a successful single line printing up to 5mm , but construct collapse occurs when a 10 - mm height is attempted . Printing the OsteoInk V R up to 20mm is therefore not possible . Both G1 and G2 inks show artifact - free printing for con - structs larger than 25mm , while the OsteoInk V R collapses after 5mm of printing . Table 3 .

Regenerative Biomaterials , 2023 , Vol . 10 , rbad084 | 5 Total solvent removal is confirmed and does not jeopardize filament shape The weight of the 3D - printed scaffold is measured during the two - step solvent removal process , which starts with a 24 - h step under vacuum and ends at 48 - h following an additional 24 - h step in a water bath ( Figure 3A ) . The vacuum step causes a reduction of ca . 10 % of the scaffold weight , while the water step accounts for additional ca . 55 % weight lost in both groups , which corre - sponds to the ca . 65 % weight ratio of the solvent within the scaf - fold before removal . Total solvent removal is indirectly confirmed by 1H NMR after the water step at 48 h . No EC peak is present at 4 . 54ppm in both spectra of G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) ( Figure 3B ) and G2 ( þ TPU ) ( Figure 3C ) . Representative photo—and SEM images of 3D - printed scaf - folds ( Design 1 ) ( Figure 4 ) after solvent removal illustrates the shape of the overall scaffold , the filament and the surface , as well as the side view of both groups . Filament shape remains in - tact after solvent removal . Increased surface roughness is visible in G2 ( þ TPU ) compared to G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) as noticeable from m CT images ( Figure 5A ) . The side view of cut filaments in the SEM images show slightly elliptic shape in both groups . Porosity is present at three levels from macro to micro to nano scale The macro - scale printing porosity , representing the negative space within the 3D - printed scaffold in - between the struts , is calculated to be 31 . 5 6 3 . 0 % for G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) and 32 6 6 . 1 % for G2 ( þ TPU ) ( Figure 5A ) .

G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) has a surface porosity of 21 6 1 . 2 % , a significantly increased number compared to 10 6 2 . 2 % of G2 ( þ TPU ) . Nano - scale porosity is visible in the SEM images for both groups ( Figure 5C ) . The adsorption and desorption isotherm profiles of both groups are considered type 3 isotherms and show H3 type hysteresis loops according to the IUPAC classification [ 29 ] . The addition of TPU decreases mes - oporosity , the SSA , while the desorption average pore width value is increased ( Table 4 ) .

The pH of the PBS slightly decreases over the incubation period but remains close to neutral between ca . 7 . 4 and 7 in both groups confirming no acidic change of the milieus ( Figure 6B ) . The addition of TPU leads to a decreased compressive stiffness The addition of TPU significantly decreases the Young’s modulus ( Figure 7A ) of 3D - printed scaffolds from 43 6 4 . 2MPa in G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) to 33 6 4 . 8MPa in G2 ( þ TPU ) ( Design 1 ) under cyclic mechanical compression , while no difference is measured for the yield stress ( Figure 7B ) ( G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) : 1 . 5 6 0 . 16 and G2 ( þ TPU ) : 1 . 5 6 0 . 26MPa ) and yield strain ( Figure 7C ) ( G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) : 0 . 06 6 0 . 005 and G2 ( þ TPU ) : 0 . 06 6 0 . 004 ) . Both groups show significantly increased Young’s modulus and yield stress compared to the OsteoInk V R ( 13 6 2 . 8MPa and 0 . 5 6 0 . 1MPa , respectively ) , but not for the yield strain ( 0 . 07 6 0 . 02 ) . Scaffolds of both groups resist drilling and screwing Drilling using a 1 . 8 - mm drill head and screwing using 2mm med - ical grade screw does not break or impair the 3D - printed scaffolds ( Design 1 ) ( Figure 8A ) but does break the OsteoInk V R scaffold ( Supplementary Video ) , which therefore cannot be used for the screw pull - out test . To pull out the screw from pre - drilled scaf - folds of G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) a maximal force of 10 N 6 2 . 4 is required , while a significantly increased force of 14 N 6 4 . 5 is required for G2 / þ TPU ( Figure 8B ) . The force is significantly decreased compared to the scaffolds in which no pre - drilling was performed for both groups ( Figure 8B ) . The addition of TPU leads to an increased trend of maximal force , but no statistical significance was calcu - lated with G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) being at 16 6 2 . 1N and G2 ( þ TPU ) being at 19 6 4 . 1N . The addition of TPU decreases proliferation of seeded hBM - MSCs after 7 days of culture Biocompatibility of 3D - printed scaffolds ( Design 1 ) is investigated via an indirect cytotoxicity test using the L929 fibroblast cell line . Cells are cultured with conditioned media from both scaffold groups and showed metabolic activity greater than 100 % when normalized to cells in control medium ( Figure 9A ) . DNA quantification of hBM - MSCs from three independent donors directly seeded on 3D - printed discs ( Design 2 ) shows pro - liferation from day 1 to day 7 for both groups . While no difference is measured between the two groups at day 1 , a statistically sig - nificant difference is observed between G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) and G2 ( þ TPU ) at day 7 ( Figure 9A ) . The proliferation is confirmed by live / dead images ( Figure 9A ) in which more live cells are visible on G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) compared to G2 ( þ TPU ) at day 7 . Both groups show no cytotoxicity , while G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) favours cell proliferation compared to G2 ( þ TPU ) . b - TCP particles are homogeneously distributed on 3D - printed discs of both groups To understand the b - TCP exposure on the scaffolds , 3D - printed discs ( Design 2 ) are stained with Alizarin red . b - TCP particles are homogeneously distributed on the discs for both groups and the addition of TPU leads to a decrease of b - TCP exposure , visible with less red stained surface on G2 ( þ TPU ) ( Figure 10A ) . The mea - sured concentration of Alizarin red confirms the images with a trend of higher dye concentration in G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) compared to G2 ( þ TPU ) , but with no statistically significant difference ( Figure 10B ) . These findings are in accordance with the increased ratio of b - TCP within the scaffold in G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) compared to G2 ( þ TPU ) as a consequence of the TPU addition . hBM - MSCs undergo osteogenesis when seeded on 3D - printed discs G1 ( 2 TPU ) In light of the enhanced proliferation profile of G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) ( Figure 9B and C ) , this group was selected to carry out the osteo - genic assay using hBM - MSCs of three independent donors . Cells are seeded and cultured on either coverslip under osteocontrol condition or on 3D - printed discs ( Design 2 ) under osteocontrol and osteogenic condition for 28days . ALP activity at day 14 , nor - malized to the DNA content is upregulated in both disc groups compared to the coverslip osteocontrol group , and in the disc os - teogenic group compared to the disc osteocontrol group ( Figure 11A ) . Confocal images of the fluorescent - stained mineral deposition at day 28 show visibly increased mineralization in the disc osteogenic group compared to the disc osteocontrol group , while no mineralization is detected in the coverslip osteocontrol group ( Figure 11B ) . Gene expression of hBM - MSCs on 3D - printed discs show an upregulation of ALPL , IBSP , SP7 and SPP1 , all rele - vant makers for osteogenesis , when cultured under osteogenic conditions compared to control conditions without statistical sig - nificance ( Figure 11C ) . ALP activity and mineral deposition indicates osteogenic dif - ferentiation of hBM - MSCs when cultured on G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) discs , with enhanced effects under osteogenic culture conditions , especially visible looking at the gene expression of osteo - relevant markers . Solvent - based printing can create precise large - scale scaffolds To further demonstrate the clinical compatibility of this biofabri - cation tool , a precise and patient - specific mandible defect - sized scaffold based on PLGA / b - TCP is printed using the solvent - based printing approach ( Figure 12 ) . The macro - porous 3D - printed scaf - fold shows precise defect fitting upon implantation in the defect site , a highly desired characteristic for patient’s aesthetics . Discussion The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D - printing fabrication technique to create porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering . To increase the availability of different bone substitutes and maxi - mize the possibility to eventually replace the current SOC of autol - ogous bone grafting for the repair of bone defects an easy , cheap and versatile biofabrication process is advantageous . By applying a low - temperature solvent - based printing approach , we successfully fabricated a bone substitute with a three - level macro - , micro - and nano - porosity based on a new formulation PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU with adequate fidelity , cytocompatibility and osteogenic potential . To 3D print PLGA / CaP - based materials for the creation of bone substitutes , the heat - melt printing approach has been generally Table 4 .

As an alternative for 3D printing of PLA - based materials the solvent based printing approach can not only create porous surfaces upon solvent removal of 3D - printed scaffolds but also allows for easy loading and mixing of bioactive factors without the need for post - process chemical modification as previously shown [ 21 ] . The presented fabrication method demonstrates the modulation of final material properties such as surface roughness and porosity , both highly connected to osteogenesis outcomes [ 15 , 16 ] via the addition of TPU to the PLGA / b - TCP composite , which has not been reported previously . To avoid the use of toxic organic solvents such as chloroform [ 21 , 44 ] , dichloromethane [ 39 , 45 ] or dimethyl sulfoxide [ 46 ] , commonly used for dissolving the poly - meric component , we use EC . It has no toxicity , and it is water sol - uble . EC solidifies at temperatures lower than 37 (cid:2) C , which allows solidification at lower temperatures and for easy removal in a warm water bath without modification of the fabricated water in - soluble polymeric scaffold . Both inks show viscous like behaviour confirmed by rheologi - cal characterization and adequate printability for constructs in the size range relevant to large bone defects of (cid:5) 3cm in height , which is according to the human critical - sized defects of 2 . 5cm [ 47 ] . Furthermore , the comparison to the commercially available OsteoInk V R demonstrates the superior printability of both inks . 3D - printed PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU scaffolds retain fidelity after to - tal EC removal confirmed by NMR analysis and take up ca . 55 – 65 % of aqueous liquid compared to their original weights . Biodegradation plays a pivotal role in facilitating optimal bone healing in vivo . For scaffolds to be used as bone graft substitutes , their primary function should be to initiate the bone healing pro - cess by serving as initial templates . The scaffolds should gradu - ally degrade as new bone forms , without causing toxic side effects such releasing acidic products [ 48 ] . However , determining the ideal degradation rate of an implanted scaffolds is challeng - ing and remains to be elucidated . PLGA , b - TCP and TPU are known to be biodegradable [ 23 , 49 , 50 ] . However , observations from in vitro degradation measurements showed no degradation of the 3D - printed scaffolds over a 28 - day incubation period in PBS . To obtain accurate values on the degradation rate , long - term in vivo degradation experiments would be necessary too , a limitation of this study . The biodegradation of polymers such as PLGA has shown to cause acidic alterations in the surrounding environment [ 51 ] . This phenomenon was not observed in the case of the scaffolds presented . The porosity of the scaffold is an important material property for the adhesion of cells through enhanced adsorption of pro - teins , due to larger surface area [ 17 ] and the potential vessel and bone tissue infiltration into the scaffold in vivo [ 15 , 16 ] . We report the presence of the porosity on the scaffolds in three different levels : the macro porosity determined by the printing design , the micro - and nano - porosity created from the EC removal . The macro pore size of the scaffold is strongly related to neovasculari - zation with larger pore sizes being beneficial for desired ingrowth of blood vessels [ 52 ] . In vivo fibrous tissue ingrowth is decreasing with increasing pore sizes , with 400 m m being the minimum pore size for optimal blood vessel growth [ 52 ] , which is in accordance with an average macro pore size of 1mm of the scaffolds of both groups . Furthermore , interconnected macropores promote body fluid circulation and cell migration to the core of the implant [ 53 ] . Previous studies report macro porosities of scaffolds created from solvent - based printing between 70 % and 80 % [ 21 , 54 ] , much higher than obtained in this study at ca . 32 % . Increasing the macro porosity can benefit tissue ingrowth , but decreases me - chanical properties [ 55 , 56 ] . It is therefore important to find the balance of an optimal macro pore size without sacrificing me - chanical strength of the scaffold . The presence of surface poros - ity in the micro [ 16 ] and nano [ 57 ] range is known to be 0 10 20 30 40 50 Y oung ' s m odu l u s ( M P a ) A p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 Y i e l d s t r ess ( M P a ) B p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 Y i e l d s t r a i n ( - ) G1 ( - TPU ) G2 ( + TPU ) OsteoInk C Figure 7 .

Regenerative Biomaterials , 2023 , Vol . 10 , rbad084 | 9 advantageous for cell adhesion and osteogenesis , but the optimal pore size is still unclear . The average surface pore size of G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) is measured to be 60 m m , while the addition of TPU increases the average pore size to 130 m m . The decreased surface porosity upon addition of TPU is credited to the decreased num - ber of pores in G2 ( þ TPU ) compared to G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) . Nano meso - porosity reported from literature regarding the SSA is 6m 2 / g and an average pore size of 22nm of PCL / HAp / CNT based on N 2 sorp - tion higher [ 45 ] compared to the reported SSA of 1 – 2 . 5m 2 / g and average pore size of 15 – 19nm in this study . Controlling the macro porosity of a 3D - printed scaffold is simple thanks to the nature of 3D printing but challenging for the micro and nano range . The differences in the micro and nano range can be related to proc - essing and the choice of material . Process - related changes such as the choice of the solvent can have an effect : porosities can be created via the evaporation of a volatile solvent or water medi - ated dissolution such as in this study . Adding an additional mate - rial has also shown to change the micro porosity when CNT were added to the PCL / HAp scaffold [ 45 ] or TPU to PLGA / b - TCP in this study . The presence of porosity in the three level ranges is a rele - vant factor for enhanced osteogenic potential of a scaffold and therefore should preferably be available when a new bone substi - tute is created . The addition of TPU was hypothesized to increase elasticity , but the presented mechanical properties suggest otherwise . The addition caused a significant decrease in Young’s modulus from 43MPa in G1 ( (cid:3) TPU ) to 33MPa G2 ( þ TPU ) , which are similar values of PLGA / TCP at 46MPa from literature [ 43 ] . To assess the poten - tial clinical translation mechanical properties of the PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU scaffolds are compared to the commercially available OsteoInk V R , which shows significantly decreased Young’s modu - lus and yield stress . Natural bone on the other hand has a much higher stiffness compared to the presented scaffolds : trabecular : 10GPa and cortical : 19GPa when tested mechanically [ 58 ] . The advantage of adding TPU , known for its high ductility properties [ 59 ] , is shown by the increased resilience against pulling out screws , which would potentially translate in a less likely me - chanical failure of the implant . The brittle nature of OsteoInk V R is demonstrated when the screw - pull out test was not possible due to the breakage of the scaffolds beforehand , while the PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU scaffolds remain structurally intact . Mechanical resil - ience of the scaffold is credited to the inclusion of the mechanical stable polymer PLGA and is an important aspect because the breakage of a bone substitute in vivo in a load - bearing environ - ment such as the mandible or femur can have detrimental conse - quences to the patient’s healing outcome . The lack of precise reproducibility of the printing process with resulting high varian - ces might be explained by the mixing mechanism of the compo - nents itself or unstable room conditions due to varying temperature and humidity . The PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU scaffolds show cytocompatibility when tested with two different cellular types : a L929 mouse fibro - blast cell line and primary hBM - MSCS . Additionally , hBM - MSCs showed good adhesion and viability over 7days of culture . The decreased proliferation rate of hBM - MSCs after 7days of culture on G2 ( þ TPU ) can be explained by lower surface porosity values and decreased b - TCP exposure on the surface or due to the poly - urethan’s natural anti - fouling properties [ 60 ] , but not by the sur - face hydrophilicity , measured by water contact angle experiment ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . OsteoInk V R has shown cytocompatibil - ity with MSCs [ 61 ] and allows for micro channel formation of vas - cular endothelial cells [ 62 ] . An Osteoink V R like CaP cement paste produced from INNOTERE GmbH showed promising osteogenic in vitro and in vivo results [ 63 , 64 ] . The used polymers have shown to be advantages for printability and mechanical stability , but are not bioactive , nor are known to have osteoconductive properties , a disadvantage when included in bone substitutes .

ALP , encoded by the ALPL gene , a well - known maker for bone formation and calcification [ 65 ] , provides a high phosphate concentration for osteoblasts during bone mineraliza - tion [ 66 ] . IBSP encodes for bone sialoprotein , a late stage osteo - blast differentiation marker [ 67 ] . SP7 encodes for the transcription marker Osterix , which activates the osteogenic dif - ferentiation of preosteoblasts into mature osteoblasts [ 68 ] . SPP1 encodes for Osteopontin , a late marker for osteogenic differentia - tion and important player in bone metabolism and homeostasis [ 69 ] . Statistical analysis does not show significant differences of osteogenically differentiated hBM - MSCs compared to cells cul - tured under control conditions , due to a limited donor number and high donor variability , a common consequence when pri - mary hBM - MSCs are tested [ 70 , 71 ] . However , all donors behaved similarly , the only difference being the magnitude of the re - sponse . The PLGA / b - TCP scaffold shows osteoconductive results and can be a promising candidate for further in vivo studies but requires additional in - depth in vitro investigation using more donors and timepoints to elucidate the mechanism behind the osteogenesis of hBM - MSCs seeded on these 3D - printed scaffolds . A pre - clinical in vivo study to investigate the osteogenic poten - tial of this composite will be required before clinical translation can be undertaken . Future work also aims to upgrade the pre - sented scaffold towards a vascularized bone substitute capable of suppling essential nutrients , cells and oxygen , as well as facili - tating nutrient exchange , to promote vascularization and inner - vation upon implantation into a bone defect , both crucial aspects for successful bone repair [ 72 ] . Conclusion Low - temperature solvent - based 3D printing is a suitable and versatile fabrication technique to create porous and precise scaf - folds composed of a new formulation of PLGA / b - TCP 6 TPU scaf - folds for bone tissue engineering . The presented 3D - printed scaffolds not only show superior mechanical properties com - pared to a commercially available CaP ink , but also show ade - quate cytocompatibility and osteoconductive properties . The addition of TPU to PLGA / b - TCP changes material properties such as porosity and roughness , which influences the osteogenic out - come . The fabrication tool also shows printing scaffolds with a patient - specific geometry and relevant size , that fits precisely into the defect site , which drives towards personalized oral and craniomaxillofacial orthopaedics . The future incorporation of vascularized components is of great necessity for the success of such scaffolds . The constant development and continuous in - crease in the availability of regenerative bone substitutes maxi - mizes the possibility to eventually replace the current SOC of autologous bone grafting . With regards to clinical application , safety and efficacy need to be further tested in a preclinical bone model .
