As a result , the rate at which signaling molecules traverse the endocytic pathway makes a signiﬁcant contribution to downstream output . Modulation of the core endocytic machinery facilitates differential uptake of individual cargoes . Clathrin - coated pits are a major entry portal where assembled clathrin forms a lattice around invag - inating buds that have captured endocytic cargo . Clathrin assembles into triskelia composed of three clathrin heavy chains and associated clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) . Despite the identiﬁcation of clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface over 30 years ago , the functions of CLCs in endocytosis have been elusive . Results : In this work , we identify a novel role for CLCs in the regulated endocytosis of speciﬁc cargoes . Small interfering RNA - mediated knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb inhibits the uptake of GPCRs . Moreover , we demonstrate that phos - phorylation of Ser204 in CLCb is required for efﬁcient endocy - tosis of a subset of GPCRs and identify G protein - coupled receptor kinase 2 ( GRK2 ) as a kinase that can phosphorylate CLCb on Ser204 . Overexpression of CLCb S204A speciﬁcally inhibits the endocytosis of those GPCRs whose endocytosis is GRK2 - dependent . Conclusions : Together , these results indicate that CLCb phosphorylation acts as a discriminator for the endocytosis of speciﬁc GPCRs . Introduction Clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( internalization ) is required for the trafﬁcking and signaling of a range of receptors including the vast majority of the > 800 G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) in the human genome [ 1 ] . Clathrin assem - bles from the cytoplasm at specialized regions of the cell surface called clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) . The CCPs invagi - nate and pinch off to form clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . Following CCV uncoating , the endocytic vesicle is targeted to early endosomes where the cargo proteins are sorted to a variety of intracellular destinations [ 2 ] . It was originally thought that endocytosis acted to constitutively attenuate receptor signaling through removal of receptors from the cell surface , but an emerging paradigm is that subcellular localiza - tion and dwell time of signaling molecules on the endocytic pathway can be key to determining signaling output [ 3 , 4 ] . At distinct locations on the endocytic pathway , different complements of signaling components ( adaptors , kinases , phosphatases ) will be recruited , thus allowing a single signal to give rise to multiple downstream outputs and allowing sophisticated modulation of the signaling process . For GPCRs , intracellular sorting is key to the balance between the clinically relevant processes of desensitization and resen - sitization [ 1 ] . Clathrin is involved not only in the endocytosis of cell - surface receptors , but it also functions in the delivery of newly synthesized lysosomal proteins from the biosynthetic pathway to late endosomes and recycling of cargo from endosomes back to the cell surface . In addition , ﬂat clathrin lattices facili - tate the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo to multivesicular bodies [ 2 , 5 , 6 ] . Clathrin exists in solution as a triskelion composed of three clathrin heavy chains ( CHC , MW : 190 kDa ) and three clathrin light chains ( CLC , MW : w 23 – 26 kDa ) . Budding yeast have a single clathrin light chain ( Clc1p ) and Clc1p null cells exhibit growth defects as well as reduced rates of receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 7 ] . All metazoans have two light chain genes , CLCA and CLCB , which have been highly conserved throughout evolution with approximately 65 % homology between CLCA and CLCB and greater than 90 % homology between CLCs from different species [ 8 ] . To date , the func - tion ( s ) of the CLCs in metazoans has remained more elusive . They have been implicated in the trimerization of CHCs to form triskelia [ 9 ] , and recent crystallographic data have indi - cated that the CLCs inhibit clathrin assembly when bound by holding the ‘‘knee’’ of CHC in a straight conformation , which is refractory to assembly [ 10 ] . However small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated knockdown of either or both CLCs had no discernible effect on CCP assembly or receptor - mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells [ 11 – 13 ] , although recent studies showed that depletion of the CLCs affects trafﬁcking of the mannose - 6 phosphate receptor from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to late endosomes [ 13 ] . In vitro clathrin disassembly occurs by the combined action of hsc70 , which is recruited by a DnaJ domain containing protein , auxilin ( neuronal cells ) , or GAK ( cyclin G associated kinase ) ( nonneuronal cells ) [ 14 ] . Auxilin / GAK binds to CHC [ 15 ] , and there is a burst of auxilin recruitment just prior to CCV scission [ 16 , 17 ] , consistent with its role in uncoating . Initial in vitro studies had identiﬁed a role for CLCs in the recruitment of hsc70 to CCVs [ 18 ] . However , subsequent analysis of the role of auxilin indicated that CLCs were dispensable for auxilin - mediated uncoating of clathrin from cages by hsc70 , at least , in vitro [ 19 ] . Following agonist stimulation , GPCRs can endocytose through CCPs . In most cases , receptors are phosphorylated by G protein - coupled receptor kinases ( GRKs ) leading to en - hanced association with arrestins , with concomitant attenua - tion of G protein - dependent signaling [ 20 ] . Following binding 3 These authors contributed equally to the work * Correspondence : e . smythe @ shefﬁeld . ac . uk to GPCRs , arrestins can interact with CHC and the AP2 adaptor complex , thus facilitating recruitment of GPCRs to CCPs and subsequent endocytosis [ 21 ] . In some cases , GPCRs can trafﬁc into CCPs in an arrestin - independent manner [ 22 , 23 ] . Following delivery to endosomes , GPCRs may be rapidly recycled , resulting in resensitization , or tar - geted to lysosomes for degradation [ 22 ] . Furthermore , GPCRs can continue to signal in a G protein - independent manner following delivery to endosomes [ 3 ] . There is however considerable evidence to support a more complex regulation of GPCR signaling and trafﬁcking , which gives exquisite spatiotemporal regulation [ 3 , 20 ] . Different agonists can result in distinct trafﬁcking outcomes , e . g . , the endocytosis of the m opioid receptor ( MOPr ) , which displays ligand - dependent trafﬁcking into CCPs [ 23 ] . There is also evidence that GPCRs can be sorted into different classes of CCPs [ 24 ] that regulate GPCR uptake by different mecha - nisms . For example , the purinergic GPCRs P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 are both endocytosed via clathrin - dependent pathways , but whereas P2Y 12 requires GRK2 and arrestins , P2Y 1 trafﬁcking is independent of these components but requires protein kinase C ( PKC ) [ 25 ] . Not all CCPs are uniform in their ability to recruit GPCR cargo [ 24 , 25 ] and the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown . In this study , we report a novel role for CLCs in the uptake of GPCRs . We demonstrate that CLCb phosphorylation is important for endocytosis where it contributes to efﬁcient uncoating of CCVs . Furthermore we show that phosphoryla - tion of CLCb , most likely by GRK2 , may play a critical role in the segregation of GPCRs into distinct subpopulations of CCPs . In addition , we highlight a potentially important novel role for GRK2 in regulating GPCR trafﬁcking downstream of receptor phosphorylation . Results Phosphorylation of CLCb Regulates Endocytosis Previous studies had shown that siRNA - mediated knockdown of CLCs did not affect transferrin uptake [ 11 – 13 ] . In order to understand the functions of CLCs , we adopted an alternative approach of asking whether CLC phosphorylation is impor - tant in the regulation of endocytosis . CLCb is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro , predominantly on serine residues [ 26 , 27 ] . There are 19 serine residues in bovine CLCb ( see Figures S1A and S1B available online ) . The amino acids referred to in this work refer to the positions in neuronal bovine CLCb . As a ﬁrst step to investigate the role of CLCb phosphorylation , we generated a FLAG - tagged mutant form of bovine CLCb where all 19 serine residues were converted to alanines , CLCb S all A . Transfection of HEK293T cells with CLCb wt and CLCb S all A resulted in signiﬁcant levels of overex - pression compared to endogenous CLCb ( Figure 1B ) . We veriﬁed that immunoprecipitation of both wild - type ( WT ) and mutant protein with anti - FLAG antibodies resulted in the coprecipitation of similar amounts of CHC . Under conditions where < 10 % of the FLAG - tagged CLCs ( CLCb wt : 4 % ; CLCb S all A : 8 % ; CLCb S204A : 7 % ; and CLC S204D : 5 % ) was immu - noprecipitated , a signiﬁcant amount of CHC ( CLCb wt : 11 % ; CLCb S all A : 22 % ; CLCb S204A : 18 % ; and CLC S204D : 18 % ) was coimmunoprecipitated indicating that the recombinant CLCs could associate with CHC in intact cells ( Figure 1A ) . Recipro - cally , immunoprecipitated CHC showed an approximately 60 : 40 ratio of FLAG - tagged CLCs to endogenous CLCa and CLCb ( Figure 1B : CLCb wt : 68 % ; CLCb S all A : 59 % ; CLCb S204A : 61 % ; and CLC S204D : 65 % ) . To conﬁrm that CLCb S all A could assemble into CCPs , we examined the colocalization of over - expressed CLCs with antibodies against CHC ( X22 ) ( Figure 1C ) and found good colocalization of FLAG - tagged CLCs with CHC ( CLCb wt : 91 . 2 % ; CLCb S all A : 88 . 7 % ; CLCb S204A : 92 . 2 % ; CLCb S204D : 90 . 1 % ) . There was similarly good colocalization with TfR and AP2 ( Figure S2A ) . Furthermore , recombinant CLCs could assemble into reconstituted clathrin cages in vitro ( Figure S3 ) .

See also Figures S1 and S2 . Current Biology Vol 22 No 15 1362 We next asked whether overexpression of CLCb S all A affected endocytosis by measuring the rate of transferrin inter - nalization in cells transfected with either CLCb wt or CLCb S all A . Whereas cells transfected with CLCb wt showed similar kinetics of endocytosis compared to control cells ( Figure S2B ) , overexpression of CLCb S all A caused a dominant - negative effect on endocytosis with a reduction ( w 30 % ) in the rate of transferrin internalization ( Figure 2A , top panel ) . In contrast , recycling from early endosomes was unaffected by CLCb S all A overexpression ( Figure 2B ) , arguing against a global disrup - tion of the endocytic pathway . In order to determine which speciﬁc residue ( s ) was impor - tant for the dominant - negative effect , we generated a series of constructs where groups of serines were mutated to alanine . By examining a range of constructs containing combi - nations of mutations and an iterative process ( Figure 2A ; Figures S3B and S3C ; data not shown ) , we were able to estab - lish that Ser204 is necessary and sufﬁcient to mediate the dominant - negative effect ( Figure 2A , second panel ) . As shown in Figure 1C , CLCb S204A also coimmunoprecipitates with CHC and colocalizes with CCP components to the same extent as CLCb S all A . We also generated a phosphomimetic mutant , CLCb S204D , and conﬁrmed that it associated with clathrin - coated structures by immunoﬂuorescence and immunopre - cipitation ( Figure 1 ) .

Clathrin Light Chains Regulate GPCR Endocytosis 1363 internalization ( Figure 2A , third panel ) , suggesting that cycles of CLCb phosphorylation are important for at least some of its functions in endocytosis .

None of these spots were present in the immu - noprecipitate where all of the serines were mutated to alanines ( CLCb S all A ) , whereas the absence of one of the spots in CLCb S204A provides strong evidence that Ser204 is phosphorylated in cells . Phosphorylation of Ser204 Is Required for Efﬁcient Uncoating in Intact Cells We next addressed how CLCb S204A overexpression might inhibit transferrin endocytosis . To do this , we used an assay in intact cells that measures cla - thrin uncoating [ 28 ] . Brieﬂy , transfected HEK293T cells are incubated for 5 min with Texas - Red transferrin ( Tx - Red Tfn ) . Cell surface Tx - Red Tfn is acid - stripped and then the degree of colocal - ization of clathrin with endocytosed Tx - Red Tfn is measured to indicate its association with endocytic vesicles . CCVs rapidly lose their coats following scission , and thus the degree of colocal - ization of Tx - Red Tfn with clathrin is low ( < 10 % , Figure 3A ) . We thus arbitrarily normalize this value to 1 in cells overex - pressing CLCb wt . Under conditions where uncoating is delayed , there is an increase in the degree of colocalization of clathrin with internalized Tx - Red Tfn [ 28 ] . Following transfection of HEK293T cells with CLCb wt or CLCb S204A or CLCb S204D , the degree of colocalization of clathrin with Tx - Red Tfn was measured and was found to be signiﬁcantly higher following expression of CLCb S204A . Overexpression of CLCb S204D also showed a delay in clathrin uncoating , which was signiﬁcantly different from CLCb wt but less than the effect observed following overex - pression of CLCb S204A ( 100 % 6 7 % for CLCb wt , 124 % 6 6 % for CLCb S204D , and 160 % 6 8 . 2 % for CLCb S204A ) ( Figure 3B ) . This indicates that CLCb S204A overexpression speciﬁcally slows clathrin uncoating . Clathrin uncoating is mediated by the combined action of hsc70 and its cofactor auxilin / GAK . We observed that Current Biology Vol 22 No 15 1364 binding of auxilin to reconstituted cages containing CLCb S204A was stronger than to cages containing CLCb S204D ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . We used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to investigate the behavior of GFP - GAK at indi - vidual clathrin spots in HeLa cells overexpressing mCherry - CLCb wt , mCherry - CLCb S204A , or mCherry - CLCb S204D ( Figures S4D – S4F ) . We observed a ‘‘burst’’ of GFP - GAK recruitment just prior to the disappearance of clathrin spots as described [ 16 , 17 ] . There was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in the rate of dissociation of GFP - GAK from clathrin spots in HeLa cells in the presence of overexpressed mCherry - CLCb S204A compared to overexpression of mCherry - CLCb S204D or CLCb wt ( Figure S3F ) . Together , these data suggest modulation of auxilin and clathrin interactions as a potential mechanism by which CLCb phosphorylation might interfere with endocytosis . Ser204 Is an In Vitro Substrate for GRK2 The next question that we wished to address was the identity of the kinase ( s ) that phosphorylates Ser204 . In silico analysis ( http : / / ppsp . biocuckoo . org / index . php ) suggested that the sequence surrounding Ser204 might be a consensus site for G protein - coupled receptor kinases ( GRKs ) . There are seven GRK family members : GRKs 1 and 7 are predominantly involved in the visual system , GRKs 2 and 3 have a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding PH domain that allows association with the plasma membrane , and GRKs 4 , 5 , and 6 use covalent modiﬁ - cation by lipids to interact with the plasma membrane [ 22 ] . Because the sequence surrounding Ser204 is also found in CLCa ( Figure S1B ) , we tested whether GST - fusion proteins including CLCa and CLCb could act as substrates for GRKs using recombinant GRK2 and GRK5 . Whereas GRK5 did not signiﬁcantly phosphorylate CLCb wt ( data not shown ) , GRK2 was capable of phosphorylating CLCb wt and CLCa wt ( Fig - ure 4A ) and , strikingly , phosphorylation was reduced ( w 50 % , n = 3 ) although not abolished in CLCb S204A , suggesting that GRK2 phosphorylates not only Ser204 but also another site ( s ) on CLCb in vitro ( Figure 4B ) . By contrast , CK2 , which is one of the major CCV kinases and phosphorylates CLCs [ 29 ] , did not appear to phosphorylate Ser204 ( Figure 4B ) . To obtain more direct evidence that GRK2 phosphorylates CLCb on Ser204 in vivo , we used siRNA to deplete GRK2 from HEK293T cells that had been transfected with FLAG - CLCb wt and FLAG - CLCb S204A . FLAG - CLCbs were then immu - noprecipitated and subjected to 2D analysis as described for Figure 2C ( Figure 4C ) . Knockdown of GRK2 was efﬁcient ( 86 % and 88 % for cells transfected with CLCb wt and CLCb S204A , respectively ) . FLAG - CLCb wt , which was immuno - precipitated from cells treated with siRNA targeting GRK2 , showed a phosphorylation pattern that differed from control cells in lacking at least one spot and which was very similar to the pattern seen in the immunoprecipitate of FLAG - CLCb S204A . siRNA knockdown of GRK2 did not alter the pattern of spots seen in the immunoprecipitate of FLAG - CLCb S204A . Together , these data provide strong evidence that GRK2 phosphorylates CLCb in cells and that Ser204 is a major site phosphorylated by GRK2 . GPCR Endocytosis Is Regulated by Differential Phosphorylation of CLCb To investigate the functional signiﬁcance of CLCb phos - phorylation by GRK2 , we asked whether the endocytosis of GPCRs , which are major in vivo substrates for GRKs , was affected by overexpression of CLCb phosphorylation mutants . We ﬁrst examined the endocytosis of MOPr in response to the peptide agonist , DAMGO , in HEK293T cells stably express - ing hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope - tagged receptor , using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) [ 23 ] . DAMGO - induced endocytosis is known to be GRK2 - dependent and at receptor - saturating concentration ( 10 m M ) , DAMGO induced up to 30 % loss of cell surface MOPr over 30 min ( Figure 4D ; [ 23 ] ) . Overexpression of either CLCb S all A ( data not shown ) or CLCb S204A ( Figure 4D ) strongly inhibited the DAMGO - induced cell surface loss of MOPr . This receptor also undergoes a small amount of endocytosis in response to the clinically important drug morphine , and as with DAMGO , expression of CLCb S204A inhibited morphine - induced endocytosis ( Fig - ure 4D ) . Together , these results indicate that mutation of Ser204 alone in CLCb is sufﬁcient to mediate the dominant - negative effect on MOPr trafﬁcking . By contrast , there was no effect on DAMGO - or morphine - induced MOPr endocytosis following overexpression of CLCb S204D . We next investigated whether Ser204 phosphorylation was the single phosphorylation site required for GPCR endocytosis or whether there were other potential regulatory sites . We decided to examine the purinergic P2Y receptors because these receptors populate different subclasses of CCPs and have different requirements for endocytosis [ 25 ] . P2Y 1 endo - cytosis is PKC - dependent , whereas P2Y 12 requires GRK2 and arrestins . 1321N1 astrocytoma cells stably expressing HA - tagged P2Y 1 or P2Y 12 were therefore transfected with vector alone ( pcDNA ) , CLCb S all A , or CLCb S204A . Following incubation with ADP , the loss of cell surface receptor was assessed by an ELISA assay . In the case of P2Y 12 , overexpres - sion of both CLCb S all A and CLCb S204A strongly inhibited the ADP - induced loss of cell surface receptor suggesting that for this receptor , mutation of Ser204 is necessary and sufﬁ - cient to mediate the dominant - negative effect ( Figure 4E ) . The endocytosis of the GRK - independent P2Y 1 receptor was enhanced by overexpression of CLCb wt . Whereas P2Y 1 inter - nalization was inhibited by overexpression of CLCb S all A , overexpression of CLCb S204A did not signiﬁcantly affect agonist - dependent receptor endocytosis ( Figure 4E ) . This result indicates that other phosphorylation sites on CLCb are important for the regulation of endocytosis of those GPCRs , such as P2Y 1 , that are GRK2 - independent . The strong dominant - negative effect of overexpression of CLCb S all A and CLCb S204A ( for P2Y 12 ) on the internalization of P2Y receptors implies a crucial role for CLCs in the endocy - tosis of these receptors . To test this , we used siRNA to knock down CLCa and CLCb in 1321N1 cells and then measured the ADP - induced endocytosis of both the P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 recep - tors ( Figure 5 ) . Knockdown of CLCs was > 50 % efﬁcient ( Fig - ure 5A ) and resulted in a striking inhibition of endocytosis of both P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 receptors ( Figure 5B ) . Previous studies have indicated that knockdown of CLCs has no signiﬁcant effect on the endocytosis of transferrin [ 11 – 13 ] . Together with the relatively mild effect of overexpression of CLCb S204A on transferrin uptake ( Figure 2A ) , these results reinforce the importance of CLCs in the uptake of speciﬁc cargoes . Discussion Through studies on CLC phosphorylation , we have uncovered a novel role for CLCs and speciﬁcally , CLCb phosphorylation , in the regulation of endocytosis . We demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that siRNA - mediated knockdown of the CLCs inhi - bits the uptake of particular endocytic cargo . We show that phosphorylation of CLCs is important for their function and , Clathrin Light Chains Regulate GPCR Endocytosis 1365 speciﬁcally , that overexpression of CLCb S204A results in a dominant - negative effect on the rate of endocytosis of cargo such as GPCRs . We present evidence to support phosphorylation of CLCb on Ser204 by GRK2 and importantly those cargoes that require GRK2 activity for endocytosis are most strongly affected by CLCb S204A overexpression .

Current Biology Vol 22 No 15 1366 Ser204 Phosphorylation of CLCb Regulates Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis siRNA - mediated ablation of CLCs has no apparent effect on the endocytic uptake of housekeeping receptors such as transferrin receptor [ 11 , 12 ] . We therefore pursued an alterna - tive approach to understand the functions of CLCs and , in particular , to address the question as to whether they might be regulated by reversible phosphorylation . Overexpression in HEK293T cells of a mutant form of CLCb where all of the serines had been mutated to alanines caused a reduction in the rate of transferrin endocytosis . By generating a series of constructs where different serines were mutated to alanines either singly or in combination , we were able to identify a single amino acid substitution , Ser204 to alanine , as being necessary and sufﬁcient to mediate the dominant - negative effect . Two - dimensional gel analysis provided strong evidence that Ser204 is phosphorylated in intact cells . This analysis indicated that other sites are also phosphorylated on CLCb , although they do not appear to be involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis of transferrin .

They may also regulate other clathrin - medi - ated events , e . g . , sorting by ﬂat clathrin lattices on endosomes or delivery of newly synthesized lysosomal proteins from the TGN to the endocytic pathway , because the ability of CLCb S all A to asso - ciate with clathrin - coated structures argues against their having a structural role in clathrin assembly . Furthermore , overexpression of CLCb S all A did not result in a global disruption of membrane trafﬁc because recycling of transferrin from early endosomes was unaffected . Although the nature of the 2D gel ex - periment does not allow us to measure quantitative changes in the level of phosphorylated spots in immunoprecip - itated samples from different sets of transfected cells , we cannot rule out the possibility that Ser204 phosphorylation is the ﬁrst site in a hierarchy of phos - phorylation sites , all of which may contribute to the modulation of endocytosis . Cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are known to regulate endocytosis [ 30 – 32 ] . Overexpression of the phosphomimetic CLCb S204D did not affect MOPr endocy - tosis or the dissociation of GFP - GAK from clathrin patches , suggesting that for these endocytic events , CLCb is likely to be phosphorylated . CLCb S204D overexpression caused a mild inhibition of transferrin internalization and clathrin uncoating , which suggests a role for CLCb dephosphorylation at other stages in the CCV cycle . CLCb Phosphorylation Acts as a Discriminator for the Endocytosis of a Subset of Cargoes The identiﬁcation of GRK2 as a kinase important for the phosphorylation of Ser204 of CLCb in vitro and in vivo has provided insight into the physiological importance of this event . GRK2 acts on a large number of GPCRs to phosphory - late them and activate downstream arrestin - dependent Clathrin Light Chains Regulate GPCR Endocytosis 1367 signaling pathways . Whereas overexpression of CLCb S all A inhibited the DAMGO - induced endocytosis of MOPr as well as that of P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 receptor endocytosis , CLCb S204A overexpression was necessary and sufﬁcient to mediate the dominant - negative effect on the endocytosis of those recep - tors that are dependent on GRK2 , i . e . , P2Y 12 and MOPr internalization . We have shown that knockdown of GRK2 is sufﬁcient to abolish phosphorylation of a site on CLCb wt that is absent from CLCb S204A , indicating that GRK2 is indeed an in vivo kinase for CLCb . Our data indicate that other phosphorylation sites in CLCb play roles in the uptake of GRK - independent cargo such as P2Y 1 . Transferrin receptor is endocytosed irrespective of the presence or absence of bound transferrin [ 33 ] and is generally regarded as a constitutive cargo which , together with the abundance of transferrin receptors on the cell surface of most cells , suggests that transferrin receptor would be Figure 6 . CLCb Phosphorylation Acts as a Discriminator for Different CCP Populations CLCb phosphorylation is important for endocy - tosis of a range of housekeeping receptors such as transferrin receptor and signaling cargo such as GPCRs . GPCRs such as P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 enter cells via different populations of CCPs . Overexpression of CLCb S all A has a domi - nant - negative effect on endocytosis of several GPCRs . Phosphorylation of Ser204 is most important for those cargoes that are dependent on GRK2 for their endocytosis , e . g . , P2Y 12 and MOPr . This supports the existence of CCP subpopulations , selective for particular cargo . Housekeeping receptors such as transferrin receptor may enter cells through either popula - tion . The portal of entry into cells and the dwell time at a particular location is likely to signiﬁ - cantly impact on the signaling output of cargoes such as GPCRs . included in all CCPs in a stochastic fashion [ 34 ] . Although overexpression of CLCb S204A mirrors the overexpression of CLCb S all A in the inhibition of trans - ferrin uptake , the extent to which its uptake is inhibited is relatively mild compared to the more dramatic effects on GPCR endocytosis , suggesting that in HEK293T cells , transferrin receptor enters pits populated by GRK2 - depen - dent and - independent cargo ( Figure 6 ) . Furthermore , the contrast between the strong effects on GPCR uptake with the milder effects on transferrin internal - ization supports the notion that CLCs modulate cargo - speciﬁc uptake . These data are also consistent with the differ - ential effects on transferrin and GPCR uptake following knockdown of CLCs . Whereas siRNA - mediated knockdown of CLCs does not affect transferrin inter - nalization [ 11 – 13 ] , strikingly , knockdown of either CLCa or CLCb is sufﬁcient to inhibit the endocytosis of both P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 receptors suggesting that both CLCs are required for uptake , raising the interesting possibility that they may have distinct functions in cargo - speciﬁc uptake . Furthermore , overexpres - sion of CLCb wt enhanced P2Y 1 uptake suggesting that either or both CLCs may be limiting for uptake of particular cargo , consistent with the observation that in nonneuronal cells , CLCs are present in substoichiometric amounts compared to CHC [ 35 ] . Most of our experiments in this study focused on the role of CLCb . However , CLCa contains the same consensus site for GRK2 phosphorylation and can be phosphorylated as efﬁ - ciently by GRK2 in vitro . We therefore think it highly likely that phosphorylation of CLCa on this site will perform a similar function to CLCb phosphorylation . This may however be cell - type - speciﬁc because in MDBK cells , CLCb is phosphorylated to a greater extent than CLCa [ 27 ] . The identiﬁcation of an endocytic protein , CLCb , as a substrate for GRK2 is a novel ﬁnding and suggests that Current Biology Vol 22 No 15 1368 GRK2 integrates GPCR trafﬁcking and signaling by phos - phorylating core endocytic components as well as cargo . GRK5 did not phosphorylate Ser204 , suggesting interesting differences in the ability of different GRKs to direct or regulate endocytic pathways . Phosphorylation of CLCb may enhance the rate of uncoating of those CCVs that are enriched in GPCRs such as P2Y 12 and MOPr . Regulation of uncoating of CCV populations enriched in GPCRs could contribute to intra - cellular signaling by GPCRs , e . g . , by facilitating their delivery to an endosomal compartment specialized for activation of a particular signaling output . Alternatively , CLCb phosphory - lation may ‘‘mark’’ a vesicle population for a particular traf - ﬁcking pathway in the cell , e . g . , the rapid recycling pathway followed by MOPr and the P2Y 12 receptors , which leads to the relatively rapid resensitization of these GPCRs [ 36 , 37 ] . In summary , we have revealed a previously unknown function for CLCs in endocytosis . Moreover , we have shown that differential phosphorylation of CLCb is an important modulator of the endocytosis of particular cargoes such as GPCRs , which is likely to have profound effects on down - stream signaling .
