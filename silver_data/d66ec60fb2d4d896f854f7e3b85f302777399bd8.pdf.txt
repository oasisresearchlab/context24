We measured the ﬁrst wave of de novo transcription in living Drosophila embryos using dual - ﬂuorescence detection of nascent tran - scripts containing 5 0 MS2 and 3 0 PP7 RNA stem loops . Pol II elongation rates of 2 . 4 – 3 . 0 kb / min were observed , approximately twice as fast as earlier esti - mates [ 2 – 6 ] . The revised rates permit substantial levels of zygotic gene activity prior to the mid - blas - tula transition . We also provide evidence that vari - able rates of elongation are not a signiﬁcant source of differential gene activity , suggesting that tran - scription initiation and Pol II release are the key de - terminants of gene control in development . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Classical studies provide a disparity in the rates of RNA poly - merase II ( Pol II ) elongation and the timing of gene activity in the Drosophila embryo . A variety of methods suggest rates of 1 . 1 – 1 . 5 kb / min [ 2 – 6 ] , but these rates are inadequate to permit expression of large genes during the short interphase periods that characterize pre - cellular stages of development . For example , the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) inhibitor Short gastrulation ( Sog ) is encoded by a transcription unit that is (cid:2) 22 kb in length , but it nonetheless produces detectable full - length transcripts during the (cid:2) 10 - to 12 - min interphase of nuclear cycle ( nc ) 13 [ 7 ] . Moreover , recent live - imaging studies revealed highly dynamic transcriptional bursting proﬁles that are incompatible with traditional estimates of Pol II elongation rates [ 8 , 9 ] . Here , we employ newly developed quantitative imag - ing methods to determine the rates of Pol II elongation in living Drosophila embryos . For this purpose , we created a lacZ reporter gene containing 24 3 MS2 RNA stem loops at the 5 0 UTR and 24 3 PP7 RNA stem loops at the 3 0 UTR and placed it under the control of a 787 - bp regulatory DNA containing the hunchback ( hb ) proximal enhancer and P2 promoter ( Figure 1A , top ) . As a control , we examined a lacZ reporter containing tandem repeats of inter - mixed PP7 / MS2 loops at the 5 0 UTR ( Figure 1A , bottom ) . These reporter genes were integrated into a speciﬁc landing site using phiC31 - mediated transgenesis [ 10 ] . Nascent transcripts were visualized using MS2 coat protein ( MCP ) - GFP and mCherry - PP7 coat protein ( PCP ) fusion proteins , which detect MS2 and PP7 RNA stem loops , respectively [ 9 , 11 ] . The hb proximal enhancer mediates faithful activation of reporter gene expres - sion in anterior regions of transgenic embryos ( Movie S1 ) . As expected , the control hb - PP7 - MS2 - lacZ reporter gene containing intermixed 5 0 MS2 and PP7 RNA stem loops dis - plays simultaneous GFP and mCherry ﬂuorescent dots during the onset of nc 14 ( Figures 1B and 1C and Movie S2 ) . In contrast , the hb - MS2 - lacZ - PP7 reporter gene containing separate 5 0 MS2 and 3 0 PP7 RNA stem loops displays sequen - tial GFP and mCherry signals ( Figures 1D and 1E and Movie S3 ) . The lag in appearance of these dots depends on the rate of Pol II elongation during the transcription of the lacZ reporter gene . We used a variety of computational methods to measure Pol II elongation rates , including the time to reach 30 % peak intensity of MS2 and PP7 signals in quantitative traces of individual nuclei ( Figure S1 ; see Experimental Procedures ) . We observed an average lag ( D t ) of (cid:2) 120 s in the detection of MS2 and PP7 sig - nals ( Figure 2A ) , suggesting a Pol II elongation rate of (cid:2) 40 bp / s ( 2 . 4 kb / min ; Figures 2B and S2A ) . This value is signiﬁcantly faster than the original estimates provided by northern blotting assays using Drosophila larval tissues [ 5 ] or nuclear run - on assays using Drosophila S2 cell extracts [ 3 ] . It is possible that the ‘‘open’’ chromatin of pre - cellular embryos contributes to this rapid rate of elongation [ 12 ] . Moreover , many of the earlier estimates of Pol II elongation are based on the analysis of heat shock genes , and it is conceivable that the elevated temperatures needed for induction result in attenuated rates of elongation [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] . Here , we employ noninvasive methods of measurement and optimal culturing temperatures ( 22 (cid:3) C – 23 (cid:3) C ) . The revised estimate per - mits large patterning genes such as sog to produce mature mRNAs during the short interphase periods that occur prior to the onset of nc 14 [ 13 , 14 ] . We next sought to determine whether there is a correlation between the rates of Pol II elongation and the levels of gene expression . A gradient of the maternal Bicoid activator regulates anterior - posterior ( AP ) patterning genes such as hb in a concen - tration - dependent manner [ 15 ] . To examine the relationship be - tween the levels of Bicoid activator and rates of Pol II elongation , Current Biology 27 , 1387 – 1391 , May 8 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Ltd . 1387 we measured the rates for hb - expressing nuclei in ﬁve 20 - m m windows across the AP axis . There is very little variation in these regions ( Figures 2C , S2B , and S2D ) , despite signiﬁcant differences in the levels of total RNA output ( Figures 2D , S2C , and S2E ) . We next asked whether different regulatory DNAs might pro - duce distinct rates of Pol II elongation . Toward this end , the MS2 - lacZ - PP7 reporter gene was placed under the control of the snail ( sna ) shadow and primary enhancers [ 16 , 17 ] ( Fig - ure 3A ) . The sna - lacZ reporter genes exhibit slightly faster elongation rates ( (cid:2) 2 . 8 kb / min ) than the hb - lacZ reporter ( (cid:2) 2 . 4 kb / min ; Figures 3B and S3A ) . Similar rates were observed for transgenes containing both enhancers or only the primary enhancer alone , despite signiﬁcant differences in total RNA output [ 18 ] ( Figures 3C – 3F and S3B – S3E ) . These results suggest that the levels of gene expression depend on the rates of transcription initiation and Pol II release , and not elongation ( see below ) . However , the rates of RNA synthesis are near the theoretical limit in the early Drosophila embryo , and it is conceivable that differential rates of Pol II elongation are important for the slower developmental processes seen in mammals and other vertebrates . We also examined the impact of intronic sequences on the rate of Pol II elongation . The preceding analysis employed an intron - less lacZ transcription unit . A recent global run - on sequencing ( GRO - Seq ) study suggests that introns can augment the rate A B C D E Figure 1 .

See also Movies S1 , S2 , and S3 . of Pol II elongation in mouse embry - onic stem ( ES ) cells [ 19 ] . To determine whether something similar might occur in Drosophila , we replaced the intron - less lacZ transcription unit with the native Drosophila yellow gene , which contains a 2 . 7 - kb intron ( Figure 4A ) . Pol II exhibits an (cid:2) 20 % faster rate of elongation on this template as compared with lacZ ( Figure 4B ) . This observation is consistent with the idea that co - tran - scriptional RNA processing events do not impede Pol II elongation but instead might augment processivity . The kinetics of transcriptional bursting also sug - gest rapid rates of Pol II elongation for MS2 - yellow reporter genes under the control of deﬁned developmental enhancers [ 9 ] ( Figure S4 ) . This might explain why so many early - acting patterning genes contain short introns ( typically a few hun - dred base pairs in length ) , despite constraints on gene size imposed by the rapid interphase cycles of pre - cellular em - bryos [ 20 ] . We cannot currently exclude the possibility that the faster elongation rate seen for the yellow reporter gene is due to DNA sequence features such as GC content rather than the presence of an intron . Pol II elongation is thought to represent an important mecha - nism of differential gene activity in development , since previous studies suggest highly variable ( 4 - to 5 - fold ) rates of elongation across different genes [ 21 – 23 ] . However , we observe fairly con - stant rates of elongation in the early Drosophila embryo , with less than 25 % variation ( 2 . 4 – 3 . 0 kb / min ) for different activators , pro - moters , and reporter genes . Moreover , elongation rates do not appear to scale with the levels of total RNA output . This agrees with the idea that Pol II elongation is probably not the rate - limiting step in transcription [ 24 ] . By contrast , there is a clear correlation between RNA output and the frequency of transcrip - tional bursting [ 9 ] . We therefore conclude that transcription initiation and Pol II release are the key determinants of gene control in the early Drosophila embryo . 1388 Current Biology 27 , 1387 – 1391 , May 8 , 2017 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Site - Speciﬁc Transgenesis by phiC31 System All reporter plasmids were integrated into a unique landing site on the third chromosome using strain 9750 ( Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ) .

The resulting embryos were dechorinated and mounted between a semi - permeable membrane ( In Vitro Systems & Services ) and a coverslip ( 18 mm x 18 mm ) and embedded in Halocarbon oil 27 ( Sigma ) . Embryos were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope . Plan - Apochro - mat 40 3 / 1 . 3 numerical aperture ( NA ) oil immersion objective was used . The pixel size was set to 320 nm , and a single image consisted of 512 3 512 pixels . At each time point , a stack of 21 images separated by 0 . 5 m m was acquired , and the ﬁnal time resolution was 9 . 77 s per frame . A typical A B C D Figure 2 .

Whiskers extend to 10 th and 90 th percentile of distribution ( and in all subsequent ﬁgures ) .

See also Figures S1 and S2 . time - lapse imaging was done from the beginning of mitosis to about 10 min into the interphase , where MS2 and PP7 signals reach a plateau . Images were captured in 16 bit . The same laser power and microscope setting were used throughout this study . Image Analysis MS2 and PP7 signal intensities were extracted by analyzing a live - imaging movie where each frame is a maximum projection of a 10 - m m z stack . Nuclei segmentation , nuclei tracking , and MS2 and PP7 signal recording were performed using the previously described method [ 9 ] . Only the nuclei with active MS2 and PP7 signals were analyzed to measure the elongation rate . Measurement of Elongation Rate Three different methods were used to calculate the elongation rate . ( 1 ) In the ﬁrst method , the raw trajectories were smoothened using the local regression ( LOESS ) , and then the time point at which the signal intensity reaches 30 % of the maximum MS2 or PP7 signal was determined . The time delay ( D t ) be - tween MS2 and PP7 activation was obtained for each nucleus , and the elon - gation rate was calculated by dividing the length of the template DNA ( lacZ plus 24 3 PP7 or yellow plus 24 3 PP7 ) by the D t . This method was used in Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 . In Figure S1A , three different threshold levels ( 10 % , 30 % , and 50 % of the maximum intensity ) were used to test the consistency of the measurement . ( 2 ) In the second method , the elongation rate was measured by ﬁtting the MS2 and PP7 trajectories to an equation . For time t < t 0 , where t 0 is deﬁned as the time point when the ﬁrst MS2 or PP7 signal is detected , f ( t ) = 0 . For t > t 0 , f ( t ) = ( r 0 / k ) ( 1 - e (cid:4) ( t (cid:4) t0 ) k ) , where r 0 is a scaling parameter for the amplitude and k is a parameter with the unit of inverse time . t 0 for MS2 and PP7 traces were obtained for each nucleus , and the D t was calculated by subtracting the t 0 - MS2 from t 0 - PP7 . Then D t was used to calculate the elonga - tion rate ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . ( 3 ) The third method used a least - squares optimization to ﬁnd the time delay ( D t ) between MS2 and PP7 traces . PP7 traces were ﬁrst scaled to match the maximum amplitude of the MS2 traces , by multiplying with a scaling factor . Then by shifting the PP7 traces in incre - mental time , D t that minimizes the squared sum between shifted PP7 trace and the corresponding MS2 trace was obtained . D t for each nucleus was measured , and it was subsequently used to calculate the elongation rate ( Figures S1D – S1F ) . For the AP or the dorsal - ventral bins , size of each bin spans 20 m m . In Fig - ure S4 , the time delay from the peak to the baseline ( decay time ) was Current Biology 27 , 1387 – 1391 , May 8 , 2017 1389 measured from the proﬁle of transcriptional bursting obtained in [ 9 ] . The elon - gation rate was estimated by dividing the length of the template DNA ( yellow ) by the decay time .
