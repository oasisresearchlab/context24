Email : bittner @ austin . utexas . edu Funding information This study was supported by grants from the Lone Star Paralysis Foundation to GDB and by the NIH , grant number : R01 NS081063 to GDB Abstract Traumatic injury often results in axonal severance , initiating obligatory Wallerian degeneration of distal segments , whereas proximal segments often survive . Calcium ion ( Ca 2 1 ) influx at severed proximal axonal ends activates pathways that can induce apoptosis . However , this same Ca 2 1 - influx also activates multiple parallel pathways that seal the plasmalemma by inducing accu - mulation and fusion of vesicles at the lesion site that reduce Ca 2 1 - influx and enhance survival . We examined whether various inhibitors of Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinases ( CaMKs ) , and / or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , a common solvent for biologically active substances , affected the ability of a hippocampal - derived neuronal cell line ( B104 cells ) to seal membrane damage fol - lowing axotomy . Axolemmal sealing frequencies were assessed at different transection distances from the axon hillock and at various times after Ca 2 1 - influx ( PC times ) by observing whether trans - ected cells took - up fluorescent dyes . Inhibition of CaMKII by tatCN21 and KN - 93 , but not inhibition of CaMKI and CaMKIV by STO - 609 , affected axonal sealing frequencies . That is , CaMKII is a component of previously reported parallel pathways that induce membrane sealing , whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV are not involved . The effects of these CaMKII inhibitors on plasmalemmal sealing depended on their mechanism of inhibition , transection distance , and PC time . DMSO at low concentrations ( 90 m M – 28mM or 0 . 00064 % – 0 . 2 % v / v ) significantly increased membrane - sealing frequencies at most PC times and transection distances , possibly by permeabilizing the plasmalemma to Ca 2 1 . Inhibition of CaMKII , DMSO , PC time , and the transection distance signifi - cantly affect plasmalemmal sealing that is critical to somal survival in traumatic lesions . KEYWORDS axotomy , axolemmal sealing , CaMKII , DMSO , membrane repair , RRID : CVCL _ 0154 1 | INTRODUCTION Traumatic injuries to the PNS and CNS , including blast injuries and con - cussions , often sever the axolemma of many neurons ( He et al . , 2012 ; Mortazzavi et al . , 2015 ; Choe et al . , 2016 ; Bittner , Spaeth , Poon , Bur - gess , & McGill , 2016 ) . Traumatic plasmalemmal damage initiates a Ca 2 1 - influx that can lead to apoptosis or other mechanisms that result in the death of eukaryotic cells ( Spaeth , Boydston , Figard , Zuzek , & Bittner , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Moe , Golding , & Bement , 2015 ; Bittner et al . , 2016 ) , including nerve cells after dendritic or axonal trans - ection ( Ram (cid:1) on y Cajal , 1928 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ) . This same Ca 2 1 - influx also initiates plasmalemmal sealing by activating multiple parallel and redundant enzymatic pathways to form vesicles that travel to , fuse with , and seal the damaged membrane , thus reducing the Ca 2 1 - influx to levels measured in undamaged cells ( Steinhardt , Bi , & Alderton , 1994 ; Krause , Fishman , Ballinger , & Bittner , 1994 ; Bittner et al . , 2016 ) . The cellular / molecular mechanisms of plasmalemmal sealing are highly conserved , e . g . , as reported for xenopus oocytes , drosophila embryos , 1208 | V C 2018 Wiley Periodicals , Inc . wileyonlinelibrary . com / journal / jnr J Neuro Res . 2018 ; 96 : 1208 – 1222 . Received : 30 October 2017 | Revised : 20 February 2018 | Accepted : 22 February 2018 DOI : 10 . 1002 / jnr . 24232 invertebrate giant axons , mammalian epithelial cells , and mammalian PNS and CNS neurons ( Bittner & Fishman , 2000 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ; Zuzek et al . , 2013 ; Moe et al . , 2015 ; Bittner et al . , 2016 ) . Axons transected near their axon hil - lock seal more slowly at lower frequencies , and are associated with higher frequencies of cell death than those transected further from their axon hillock ( Yoo , Bottenstein , Bittner , & Fishman , 2004 ; Nguyen , Bittner , & Fishman , 2005 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ; McGill , Bhupanapadu Sunkesula , Poon , Mikesh , & Bittner , 2016 ) . We examined at different times after adding Ca 2 1 ( Post - Ca 2 1 influx time : PC time ) , whether the sealing of B104 cell axons , trans - ected at different distances from the axon hillock , were affected by inhibitors of Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinases ( CaMK ) . Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) is an extensively studied multifunctional enzyme that interacts with numerous proteins ( Fink & Meyer , 2002 ; Hudmon & Schulman , 2002 ; Lisman , Yasuda , & Raghavachari , 2012 ; Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2017 ) . These proteins include several Ca 2 1 - dependent proteins , such as synapsin ( Czernik , Pang , & Greengard , 1987 ) , syntaxin ( Ohyama et al . , 2002 ) , and actin ( Hoffman , Farley , & Waxham , 2013 ) , that are associated with several sealing pathways ( e . g . , PKA , PLC ) , as previously reported ( Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ; Zuzek et al . , 2013 ; Bittner et al . , 2016 ) . We utilize three inhibitors ( tatCN21 , KN - 93 , STO - 609 ) to alter the activity of CaM kinases and assess membrane sealing . TatCN21 , a pep - tide fragment , is a specific inhibitor of the CaM - dependent and inde - pendent ( “ autonomous ” ) auto - phosphorylative activity of CaMKII ( Buard et al . , 2010 ; Vest , O ’ Leary , Coultrap , Kindy , & Bayer , 2010 ; Pelli - cena & Schulman , 2014 ) . KN - 93 also inhibits CaMKII but does not inhibit its autonomous activity ( Sumi et al . , 1991 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ; Pel - licena & Schulman , 2014 ) . STO - 609 directly inhibits Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase kinase ( CaMKK ) , a necessary activator of CaMKI and CaMKIV ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2002 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2015 ; Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2017 ) . We report that the inhibi - tors tatCN21 and KN - 93 , but not STO - 609 , affect plasmalemmal seal - ing . Furthermore , with respect to saline controls , tatCN21 inhibition of CaMKII promotes plasmalemmal sealing at early PC times ( < 5 mins ) , but suppresses sealing at later PC times ( (cid:1) 5 mins ) , KN - 93 inhibition shows a similar effect to suppress sealing at later PC times , but does not increase sealing at earlier time points . These data show that CaM - KII is a member of the membrane - sealing pathway , but has multiple effects that are both dependent and independent of its auto - phosphorylative activity . Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) is commonly used as cosolvent to ensure the dissolution of hydrophobic reagents in saline ( Kelava , Ć avar , & (cid:3) Culo , 2011 ) , such as the CaM kinase inhibitors employed in this study ( e . g . , KN - 903 , STO - 609 ) . We report that DMSO , at low concen - trations of 90 m M ( 0 . 00064 % v / v ) and 28mM ( 0 . 2 % v / v ) , significantly increases plasmalemmal sealing frequencies at most transection distan - ces from the soma , and at most PC times . Our results suggest that some ( or all ) of previously reported effects of some test substances ( e . g . , KN - 93 ) dissolved in DMSO may be due to DMSO rather than to the test substance . All of these variables that affect the rate and extent of plasmalemmal sealing ( e . g . , test substance , transection distance ) can , in turn , affect the survival of a neuron with a transected axon and probably affect the survival of other cell types as well ( Ramon y Cajal , 1928 ; Yoo et al . , 2004 ; Nguyen et al . , 2005 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | Cell culture B104 cells ( Dr . Jane Bottenstein ; ICLC Cat # ATL99008 , RRID : CVCL _ 0154 ; Schubert et al . , 1974 ) , a rat hippocampal neuroblastoma line , typ - ically extend two cytoplasmic processes with numerous axon - like prop - erties ( Bottenstein & Sato , 1979 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ) . B104 cells were cultured at 37 8 C and 5 % CO 2 in 75cm 2 vented cap flasks ( Celltreat ) with a 1 : 1 mixture of Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium and Ham ’ s F12 ( DMEM / F - 12 ; HyClone or Corning ) enriched with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; HyClone or Corning ) . This growth medium was refreshed every two days until cell confluency reached 80 % . The cells were then subcultured in a new flask or plated at 5 , 000 - 15 , 000 cells / cm 2 on cell culture dishes ( 60 x 15mm ; Corning ) coated with poly - D - lysine ( 5 m g / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Plated cells were incubated in the growth medium for 24 hours and then differentiated in FBS - free DMEM / F - 12 for another 24 hours . Stock B104 cells were subcultured at most 35 times to mitigate the consequences of senescence . 2 . 2 | Axonal transection Glass knives were made by pulling microcapillary tubes with an internal diameter of 1mm ( World Precision Instruments ) using a micropipette puller ( Sutter Instrument Co . ) and breaking their tips to produce a sharp edge ( McGill et al . , 2016 ) . The glass knives were mounted on a micro - manipulator ( Narishige Instruments ) attached to either a Zeiss ICM - 405 or a Zeiss Axio Vert . A1 ( Thornwood ) phase contrast microscope . Plates with differentiated B104 cells were rinsed twice , and then filled with Ca 2 1 and Mg 2 1 free Dulbecco ’ s phosphate buffered saline ( DPBS - / - ; Gibco or Hyclone ) , with or without a test substance , and subsequently Significance Traumatic injuries to the PNS , spinal cord , and brain ( including concussions ) commonly produce axolemmal damage . Damaged axons undergo a Ca 2 1 - influx that initiates membrane sealing , and can prevent the death of the perikaryon by Ca 2 1 - induced apoptosis . We report that CaMKII , but not CaMKI and CaMKIV , participates in several steps of the sealing process . We also report that DMSO predominantly increases sealing frequencies , likely by permeabilizing the membrane to Ca 2 1 . Increases or decreases in sealing probabilities by substances , like DMSO or inhibitors of CaMKII , increase or decrease the probability of cell survival after traumatic injury . POON ET AL . | 1209 mounted on the microscope stage . Axons of B104 cells were trans - ected by lowering the glass knife onto the plate and moving the stage parallel to the edge of the knife , etching an easily visualized “ transec - tion line ” on the surface of the plate . Axons of 500 - 800 B104 cells were randomly transected in each plate within 7 minutes after adding DPBS - / - . Transecting axons in DPBS - / - prevented Ca 2 1 - induced membrane sealing and allowed any test substances to enter the axo - plasm via the transection site ( Bittner et al . , 2016 ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . To induce membrane sealing , Ca 2 1 was introduced to the cells ( Krause et al . , 1994 ; Detrait et al . , 2000a , Detrait et al . , 2000b ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ) by replacing the DPBS - / - medium ( Ca 2 1 - free ) with DPBS medium containing Ca 2 1 and Mg 2 1 ( DPBS 1 / 1 ; Gibco or Hyclone ) , as previously described ( Spaeth et al . , 2010 ) . DPBS 1 / 1 initiated the post - Ca 2 1 addition time , or “ PC time ” ( Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . At the end of the desired PC time of 2 . 5min , 3 . 75min , 5min , 10min , 15min , or 20min PC , DPBS 1 / 1 was replaced with a DPBS 1 / 1 solution containing 9nM Dextran conjugated Texas Red ( 3 kDa ; Molecular Probes ) for 15 minutes . The dye - containing DPBS 1 / 1 was washed out with dye - free DPBS 1 / 1 , and the plate was assessed for dye uptake by B104 cells . Prior to performing any protocol using a test substance , a “ batch - control ” experiment ( 5min PC , no test substance ) was always per - formed . This batch - control assessed the sealing frequencies for axons severed < 50 m m and (cid:1) 50 m m from the axon hillock to compare against established controls ( McGill et al . , 2016 ) . If the batch control results did not fall within one standard deviation versus established controls , no additional experimental data were gathered from that batch . Batch control experiments that failed this test were still included for analysis with the appropriate control dataset . 2 . 3 | Experimental test substances All test substances were introduced into DPBS - / - prior to axon trans - ection . All cells were exposed to the test substance ( s ) in Ca 2 1 - free DPBS - / - for 7 minutes , during which cells were transected , before adding Ca 2 1 - containing DPBS 1 / 1 and no test substance ( s ) . These test substances included tatCN21 ( 5 m M ) , tatSCR ( 5 m M ) , KN - 93 ( 20 m M ) , KN - 92 ( 20 m M , EMD Millipore ) , STO - 609 acetate ( 5 m M , Cay - man Chemical ) , and DMSO ( 90 m M and 28mM ) . To assist solvation , stock solutions of KN - 93 , KN - 92 , and STO - 609 were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in DPBS - / - , resulting in a final DMSO concentra - tion of 28mM ( 0 . 2 % v / v ) . 2 . 4 | Assessing sealing frequencies and transection distances Transected B104 cells ( typically 40 – 200 ) were counted on each plate within 30 minutes after dye removal using a Zeiss Axio Vert . A1 phase contrast microscope equipped with an excitation / emission filter of 595 / 615nm , and an eyepiece reticle ( Klarmann Rulings ) . Representa - tive images of cells were acquired with an iPhone 7 camera or Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera equipped with Zen software , and then had their brightness and contrast adjusted using Adobe Photoshop to enhance visibility . These individually identified B104 cells had an axon that inter - sected a transection line that often aligned with an anuclear , distal axo - nal segment on the opposite side of the transection line . Transected cells were counted as unsealed if they exhibited red fluorescence , and counted as sealed if they did not exhibit fluorescence . The distance between the transection line and the axon hillock ( “ transection dis - tance ” ) was measured using the eyepiece reticle . The distal end of the axon hillock was used as the starting point for these measurements as rough endoplasmic reticulum in axons does not extend beyond this point , and because other landmarks ( e . g . , nucleus ) had varied locations in different cells . Cells transected more than once or cells that were transected through the soma were not counted ( McGill et al . , 2016 ) . A minimum of 300 cells from at least 3 plates were counted per experi - mental protocol ( i . e . , test substance [ s ] and PC time ) . In order to identify outliers , the cells in each plate were sorted into two bins based upon their transection distance ( < 50 m m vs . (cid:1) 50 m m ) . The sealing frequency of both bins for each plate was identified , and then the weighted average sealing frequency of both bins across every plate in each condition was calculated . If a plate exhibited a bin that yielded a sealing frequency greater than three standard deviations away from the weighted average for the same condition , then that plate was excluded from all analyses . In total , 7 of the 306 plates tested failed this outlier test and were excluded . Sealing frequencies at given PC times were calculated by placing data from each transected B104 cell into one of 12 different bins according to the axonal transection distance ( McGill et al . , 2016 ) . These twelve bins starting from the axon hillock consisted of two bins each with a width of 5 l m , then five of 10 l m , two of 20 l m , two of 25 l m , and one bin containing all the remaining data of cells more distant from the axon hillock ( > 150 l m ; fig . 2e of McGill et al . , 2016 ) . In practice , no transection distances above 450 m m were measured . The sealing frequency for each bin was calculated as the percentage of transected B104 cells showing no fluorescence ( i . e . , no dye uptake , because the transected axon had sealed ) . These data were plotted for a given PC time using GraphPad Prism 7 and fitted a one - phase exponential model to these plots , as described by Equation 1 ( McGill et al . , 2016 , see Methods and corrigendum ) . Y ð x Þ 5 Y max 2 ð Y max 2 Y 0 Þ e 2 x = k ( 1 ) In Equation 1 , x represents the transection distance , Y 0 is the seal - ing frequency at a transection distance of zero from the axon hillock , Y max is the upper asymptote reached an infinite transection distance , and k represents the length constant , as described by Equation 2 . Y ð k Þ 5 ð Y max 2 Y 0 Þ 0 : 63 1 Y 0 ( 2 ) 2 . 5 | Statistical comparisons As previously determined ( Detrait et al . , 2000b ; Yoo et al . , 2004 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Zuzek et al . , 2013 ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) , the Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel Chi - Squared ( CMH v 2 ) test was the most suitable test of independence to compare sealing frequencies between an experimental treatment and a control , or between two experimental 1210 | POON ET AL . treatments . The CMH v 2 test compiles multiple 2 x 2 v 2 analyses that differ by a nominal replicate variable and determines significant differ - ences between sealing frequencies . For this study , the independent and dependent variables were PC time and fluorescence ( dye uptake ) , respectively . The replicate variable differentiating the comparisons was the transection distance . For plots of sealing frequencies versus PC times , the replicate variable was the average sealing frequency at each PC time . Fisher ’ s exact test , a v 2 test for statistical significance , was used to analyze one specific case in which a sealing curve was significantly dif - ferent than its control curve but exhibited an inconsistent effect on sealing frequencies over all transection distances ( Zuzek et al . , 2013 ) . In all cases , the Fisher exact test or the CMH v 2 test featured only one degree of freedom . Of the twenty - eight different treatments , eleven were only experimental treatments and seven were only control - treatments . The five 28mM DMSO treatments and the five 90 l M treatments were either control or experimental treatments , with their purpose determined by the specific comparison . 3 | RESULTS B104 axons were transected for 7 minutes in Ca 2 1 - free saline , with or without a test substance and / or DMSO . The Ca 2 1 - free saline was then washed out and replaced with Ca 2 1 - containing saline , inducing a Ca 2 1 - influx at the unsealed open ends of transected axons that initiated axolemmal sealing in all cut cells simultaneously . This Ca 2 1 - influx initi - ated the post - Ca 2 1 ( PC ) time at 0min PC ( Spaeth et al . , 2010 ) . After a given PC time ( e . g . , 2 . 5min PC , 15min PC , etc . ) , Texas Red Dextran dye was added to the plate . Since Texas Red Dextran is membrane impermeant , transected B104 cells that failed to seal after the PC time took up the dye ; untransected cells and transected cells that success - fully sealed did not take up the dye . After a 15 - minute exposure , the Texas Red Ca 2 1 - containing saline was washed out with dye - free Ca 2 1 - containing saline . Transected B104 cells ( Figure 1a , d – g ) were individually identified and assessed for the distance between the axonal transection point and the axon hillock ( transection distance ; Figure 1a ) , as well for dye exclusion ( sealed ; Figure 1e ) or inclusion ( not sealed ; Figure 1g ) . Untransected B104 cells ( Figure 1b ) were not counted and did not take up fluorescent dye ( Figure 1c ) . Previous studies have shown that dye inclusion of individually identified axons and cell bodies is stable for at least one hour ( Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . The transected B104 cells were sorted by transection distance into twelve consecutive bins ( McGill et al . , 2016 ) , and the sealing frequency for each bin was plotted against the average transection distance for that bin . This seal - ing frequency versus transection distance plots ( transection distance sealing curves ) were fitted with a one - phase exponential model ( Equa - tion 1 , see Methods ; McGill et al . , 2016 ; and corrigendum , 2017 ) . The bins of transection distance sealing curves were compared between conditions using the CMH v 2 test for statistical significance FIGURE 1 Phase contrast and fluorescent images of B104 cells . Images of a typical bipolar B104 cells under phase contrast ( a , b , d , f ) and fluorescence ( c , e , g ) . B104 cells that were transected at a neurite ( a , d – g ) were measured for transection distance ( a ) , or the distance between the transection site ( arrow ) and axon hillock ( arrowheads ) . Transected B104 cells that sealed excluded dye ( e ) , while cells that did not seal included fluorescent dye ( g ) . Asterisks mark transection lines POON ET AL . | 1211 ( Figure 2a – e , Figure 3 , Figure 4a – e , Figure 5 , Figure 6a – b ; Table 1 ) . Some figures ( Figure 2f , Figure 4f , Figure 6a – b , and Figure 7 ) graph the average sealing frequencies for all transection distances at each given PC time ( Zuzek et al . , 2013 ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . PC time sealing fre - quency curves for different protocols were also compared using the CMH v 2 test ( Supporting Table 1 ; Supporting Table 2 ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . 3 . 1 | TatCN21 inhibition of CaMKII affects the plasmalemmal sealing frequency TatCN21 is a cell - penetrating ‘ tat ’ peptide fused to the CN21 amino acid sequence that specifically inhibits CaM - dependent and autonomous auto - phosphorylative activity of CaMKII ( Buard et al . , 2010 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ; Pellicena & Schulman , 2014 ) . B104 cells were transected in Ca 2 1 - free saline containing 5 m M tatCN21 . Figures 2a – b and Table 1 show that tatCN21 significantly increases axolemmal - sealing frequencies at 2 . 5 and 3 . 75min PC when compared against Ca 2 1 - free saline controls ( CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) . In contrast , tatCN21 sig - nificantly decreases membrane - sealing frequencies at 5 , 10 , and 15min PC , with its greatest effect occurring at 15min PC ( Figure 2c – e ; Table 1 ; CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) . To verify that the effects of tatCN21 on sealing frequencies were due to CaMKII inhibition rather than any non - specific effects , cells were similarly treated with Ca 2 1 - free saline containing tatSCR ( 5 m M ) . TatSCR is composed of a scrambled CN21 amino acid sequence fused FIGURE 2 B104 cell - sealing frequencies vs . transection distance or PC times for Saline control , tatCN21 in saline , or tatSCR in saline .

Horizontal bars show transection distance boundaries for each bin . Hollow circles ( saline ) , filled squares ( tatCN21 ) , and X ’ s ( tatSCR ) plot average sealing frequency and transection distance for each bin ( a – e ) or average sealing frequency for each PC time ( f ) . Dashed ( saline ) , solid ( tatCN21 ) , and dotted ( tatSCR ) lines show best - fit one - phase exponential curves ( a – f ) . For Figures 2 – 7 , sealing frequency is represented in % , transection distance is represented in m m , and aster - isks ( * ) show statistical significance according to CMH v 2 : * 5 p < 0 . 05 , * * 5 p < 0 . 01 , and * * * 5 p < 0 . 001 for each bridged comparison . A bridged comparison with no asterisk is not statistically significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) 1212 | POON ET AL . to a ‘ tat ’ cell - penetrating peptide sequence and should not have any inherent effect on CaMKII activity ( Vest et al . , 2010 ) . Figure 2e and Table 1 show that there are no significant differences ( CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 17 ) in sealing frequencies at 15min PC between tatSCR and the saline controls , and that tatSCR at 15min PC produces significantly higher sealing frequencies ( CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) compared to tatCN21 . These data suggest that the effect of tatCN21 is primarily ( perhaps entirely ) due to its inhibition of CaMKII . 3 . 2 | STO - 609 inhibition of CaMKK does not affect plasmalemmal sealing Since CaMKII influences membrane sealing , other members of the Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) family might also affect sealing . STO - 609 is a membrane - permeable inhibitor of isoforms a and b of CaMKK ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2002 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2015 ) . CaMKK is necessary to activate CaMKI and CaMKIV ( Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2017 ) . To assess whether CaMKI and CaMKIV influence the sealing process , B104 cells were treated with STO - 609 ( 5 m M ) and examined for Ca 2 1 - induced membrane sealing at 15min PC , the PC time at which Ca 2 1 - induced membrane sealing had its near - maximum effect ( Figures 2 – 5 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) . Note that STO - 609 was dissolved in DMSO ( 28mM ) . Figure 3a and Table 1 show that there is no significant difference between the sealing frequencies of B104 cells treated with STO - 609 dissolved in 28mM DMSO versus cells treated with 28mM DMSO alone at 15min PC ( Figure 3a ; Table 1 ; CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 36 ) . However , there is a significant effect on the sealing frequencies for 28mM DMSO dissolved in Ca 2 1 - free saline when compared to the Ca 2 1 - free FIGURE 3 Sealing frequencies vs transection distances for 28mM DMSO , STO - 609 in 28mM DMSO , or Saline ( control ) . 28mM DMSO in saline ( a , 427 , 6 ; b , 637 , 7 ; c , 496 , 6 ; d , 472 , 7 ; e , 508 , 8 ; f , 427 , 6 ) , STO - 609 in saline and 28mM DMSO ( a , 452 , 7 ) , or Saline ( control ; b , 843 , 10 ; c , 790 , 10 ; d , 4 , 518 , 78 ; e , 2 , 947 , 41 ; f , 876 , 13 ) , at 2 . 5 ( b ) , 3 . 75 ( c ) , 5 ( d ) , 10 ( e ) , or 15min PC ( a , f ) .

These results suggest that inhibition of CaMKK does not influence membrane sealing , whereas DMSO seems to influence mem - brane sealing ( see below ) . 3 . 3 | 28 mM DMSO significantly increases plasmalemmal sealing at most PC times DMSO , at concentrations ranging from 90 m M ( 0 . 00064 % v / v ; Zuzek et al . , 2013 ) to 11 . 3M ( 80 % v / v ; Batista et al . , 2014 ) , is often used to dissolve hydrophobic test substances that are poorly soluble in water . However , DMSO can be cytotoxic or influence cellular processes , including membrane integrity ( Howard , David , & Barrett , 1999 ; 70 . 4 – 704mM or 0 . 5 – 5 % v / v ; de Menorval , Mir , Fernandez , & Reigada , 2012 ; > 1 . 41M or > 10 % v / v ; Galvao et al . , 2014 ; 282 – 563mM , 2 – 4 % ) . We compared the sealing frequencies of B104 cells transected in Ca 2 1 - free saline containing 28mM DMSO to cells transected in DMSO - free , Ca 2 1 - free saline controls at various PC times ( Figure 3b – e ) . Figure 3b – f shows that 28mM DMSO significantly increases plasmalemmal sealing frequencies at 2 . 5 ( CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) , 3 . 75 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and 10min PC ( p 5 0 . 015 ) . At 15min PC , there are signifi - cant differences between the 28mM DMSO sealing curve and the saline control - sealing curve ( p 5 0 . 002 ) . However , the sign of the effect differs with transection distance . At 15min PC , cells treated with 28mM DMSO and transected < 50 m m from their axon hillock sealed at significantly higher frequencies than saline controls ( p < 0 . 001 ; Sup - porting Table 3 ) . In contrast , there was no significant difference between the sealing frequencies of cells treated with 28mM DMSO and transected (cid:1) 50 m m from their axon hillock versus saline controls ( p 5 0 . 49 ; Supporting Table 3 ) .

Additionally , KN - 93 is known to inhibit CaMKI and CaMKIV ( Takemura et al . , 2009 ; Pellicena & Schulman , 2014 ) , as well as both voltage - gated K 1 ( Rezazadeh , Clay - don , & Fedida , 2006 ) and voltage - gated Ca 2 1 channels ( Gao , Blair , & Marshall , 2006 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ) . To assess the importance of CaMKII autonomous auto - phosphorylative activity for membrane sealing , we transected B104 cells in the presence of Ca 2 1 - free salines containing 20 m M KN - 93 dissolved in 28mM DMSO at different PC times . We compared KN - 93 sealing frequencies against cells transected in Ca 2 1 - free salines with 28mM DMSO alone . Figure 4 shows sealing frequencies of B104 cells treated with sal - ines containing 20 m M KN - 93 dissolved in 28mM DMSO versus those treated with salines containing only 28mM DMSO at various PC times . Cells treated with KN - 93 dissolved in DMSO show no significant dif - ference in sealing frequencies at shorter PC times ( i . e . , 2 . 5 or 3 . 75min PC ) compared to cells treated with DMSO in saline alone ( Figure 4a – b ; Table 1 ; CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 15 and 0 . 43 , respectively ) . However , cells treated with KN - 93 in DMSO at 5 , 10 , and 15min PC show signifi - cantly lower sealing frequencies than cells treated with 28mM DMSO ( Figure 4c – e ; Table 1 ; CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) . To verify that some of the effects of KN - 93 in 28mM DMSO on sealing frequencies were due to KN - 93 inhibition of the pathways out - lined above rather than some non - specific effect , cells were treated FIGURE 5 Sealing frequencies vs . transection distances Saline ( control ) , tatCN21 , 28mM DMSO , or KN - 93 in 28mM DMSO , as indicated as key to each panel .

The num - ber associated with each line gives the PC time ( min ) for that curve POON ET AL . | 1215 with Ca 2 1 - free salines containing 20 m M KN - 92 dissolved in 28mM DMSO . KN - 92 is a negative analog of KN - 93 that does not inhibit CaMKII but does inhibit voltage - gated K 1 channels ( Rezazadeh et al . , 2006 ) and voltage - gated Ca 2 1 channels ( Gao et al . , 2006 ) . Figure 4e shows that cells treated with KN - 92 in DMSO sealed at the same fre - quencies , as did cells treated with DMSO ( CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 85 ) and at sig - nificantly higher frequencies compared to cells treated with KN - 93 and DMSO ( Figure 4e ; Table 1 ; CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) . These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of KN - 93 on CaMKII are responsible for at least some ( and perhaps all ) of the effects of KN - 93 on sealing frequencies . 3 . 5 | Effects of increasing transection distances and PC times on sealing frequencies To better illustrate effects of PC time and transection distance on seal - ing frequencies , we plotted the sealing curves for each treatment ( at 2 . 5 , 3 . 75 , 5 , 10 , and 15min PC ) on a single graph and compared the curves for each treatment to each other in a pairwise manner via CMH v 2 ( Figure 5 ; Supporting Tables 4 – 8 ) . Pairwise comparisons for cells treated with saline ( Figure 5a ) show that for eight of the ten possible combinations , the cells assessed at the longer PC time have significantly greater sealing frequencies than cells assessed at the shorter PC time ( p < 0 . 001 , Supporting Table 4 ) . In the other two comparisons , no significant difference was found . In con - trast , similar pairwise comparisons of cells treated with tatCN21 in saline ( Figure 5b ) show no significant differences between any of the possible combinations ( p (cid:1) 0 . 053 in all cases ; Supporting Table 5 ) . The pairwise comparisons for 28mM DMSO curves ( Figure 5c ) reveal that four of the ten possible comparisons have significant differ - ences ( p < 0 . 05 in three cases , p < 0 . 01 in one ; Supporting Table 6 ) . In all four circumstances , the higher PC time is associated with a higher sealing frequency . For pairwise comparisons of curves for saline con - taining KN - 93 dissolved in 28mM DMSO ( Figure 5d ) , four of ten possi - ble comparisons yield significant differences ( p < 0 . 001 in three cases , p < 0 . 05 in one ; Supporting Table 7 ) . All four of these comparisons that are significantly different compare 15min PC with another PC time . For KN - 93 , the shorter PC time is associated with a significantly higher sealing frequency . A more detailed analysis of these curves shows that shorter PC times are associated with a higher sealing frequency at shorter transection distances , but not at the longest transection distan - ces . We do not know why shorter PC times should be associated with higher sealing frequencies for curves of KN - 93 dissolved in DMSO . We also note that both KN - 93 and DMSO curves reach their maximum pla - teau sealing frequency ( Y max ) at short transection distances and cur - rently have no explanation for this very - repeatable effect .

Examining the coefficients of the exponential model ( Supporting Table 9 ) , we find that the Y max generally increases with increased PC times from 3 . 75 to 10min PC for control salines and salines containing DMSO . Other measures , such as k ( length constant ) and Y 0 ( sealing fre - quency at a zero - transection distance ) , show no correlation with PC time . 3 . 6 | Effect of PC time on sealing frequencies at all transection distances for different test substances To explore the effects of tatCN21 , DMSO , and KN - 93 on the rate of membrane sealing , we plotted the average sealing frequency of all transected B104 cells under each condition against their PC times . Fig - ure 2f and Supporting Table 1 compares the sealing frequencies of cells treated with 5 m M tatCN21 in saline to cells treated with saline alone and show that the PC time sealing frequency curve for cells treated with tatCN21 is significantly different ( CMH v 2 , p < 0 . 001 ; Supporting Table 1 ) from the saline control curve . Cells treated with tatCN21 reached maximum plateau sealing frequencies more rapidly than saline control cells and exhibited a lower plateau sealing frequency ( Support - ing Table 10 ) . Figure 4f compares the average sealing frequencies of cells treated with 20 m M KN - 93 dissolved in 28mM DMSO and saline , 28mM DMSO only in saline , or saline alone at different PC times . There was a significant difference between the PC time versus sealing frequency curves for cells treated with 28mM DMSO in saline versus cells treated with saline alone ( Supporting Table 1 ; CMH v 2 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Cells treated with saline and cells treated with 28mM DMSO have similar maximum plateaus , but cells treated with 28mM DMSO reach their maximum plateaus at shorter PC times ( Supporting Table 10 ) . Figure 4 and Supporting Table 1 also show that there is a significant difference between the sealing frequency curves of cells treated with 20 m M KN - 93 dissolved in 28mM DMSO and saline , and the curves for cells treated with 28mM DMSO in saline ( Supporting Table 1 ; CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ) . Notably , the one - phase exponential model did not fit the KN - 93 data . The average sealing frequency for cells treated with KN - 93 remained consistent across all PC times , suggesting that the cells reach their plateau sealing frequency in less than 2 . 5min , possibly even 1 . 25min , after Ca 2 1 addition .

POON ET AL . | 1217 3 . 7 | Effect of DMSO concentration on sealing frequencies Our laboratory has previously published a few experiments that used DMSO in combination with other substances that affected B104 seal - ing frequencies . Zuzek et al . , ( 2013 ) reported that 90 m M DMSO had no significant effect on the average sealing frequencies of B104 cells transected > 50 m m from their axon hillock . To verify these results and to examine the effects of 90 m M DMSO at all transection distances , we treated B104 cells with 90 m M DMSO in Ca 2 1 - free saline and plotted the average sealing frequency of all cells transected > 50 m m from their axon hillock at each PC - time . Figure 6a compares our current data against those reported by Zuzek et al . , ( 2013 ) , and shows no significant difference versus saline controls ( Table 3 ; CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 11 ) . However , Figure 6b shows that in our current data , 90 m M DMSO significantly increases the sealing frequency of B104 cells transected < 50 m m from their axon hillock versus saline controls ( CMH v 2 p < 0 . 001 ; Supporting Table 2 ) , a protocol not examined by Zuzek et al . , ( 2013 ) . To better assess the effects of transection distance on sealing fre - quency of B104 cells treated with 90 m M DMSO across all PC times , we plotted the sealing curves of all PC times onto a single graph ( Figure 6c ) . Pairwise comparisons of all curves show that 7 of the 10 pairs are significantly different ( CMH v 2 p < 0 . 05 in three cases , p < 0 . 001 in four ; Supporting Table 8 ) . In each of these 7 pairs , the curve at the higher PC time was associated with a higher sealing frequency . The sealing curves of 2 . 5 , 3 . 75 , and 5min PC have similar maximum plateau values ( Supporting Table 9 ) . We also measured sealing frequencies at 1 . 25min PC but found that these data have the greatest variability in sealing frequency between plates because a solution change requires 5 – 10 seconds to complete . Hence , the exact PC starting time cannot be precisely quantified and this uncertainty has a much greater effect on sealing frequency for shorter PC times than for longer PC times . Considering the results of cells treated with 90 m M DMSO , as well as those treated with 28mM DMSO , we examined possible dose - dependent effects of DMSO on B104 sealing frequencies . We calcu - lated the sealing frequencies of cells treated with 28mM or 90 m M DMSO at transection distances < 50 m m or > 50 m m from the axon hil - lock for each PC time and plotted the PC time sealing frequency curves . B104 cells treated with 90 m M DMSO do not have significantly different sealing frequencies compared to cells treated with 28mM DMSO at < 50 m m ( Figure 7a ; Supporting Table 2 ; CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 68 ) , or > 50 m m ( Figure 7b ; Supporting Table 2 ; CMH v 2 p 5 0 . 37 ) from their axon hillock . 4 | DISCUSSION In this paper , we examined the effects of three CaM kinase inhibitors ( tatCN21 , KN - 93 , and STO - 609 ) on plasmalemmal sealing of transected B104 cell axons . Our protocol includes the addition of these inhibitors before transecting axons , the removal of these inhibitors just prior to adding Ca 2 1 to initiate the sealing process , and the examination of sealing frequencies at various PC times and transection distances . We also examined the effect of DMSO on plasmalemmal sealing . We mitigated bias by having different researchers conduct the same experi - ments , combining the data prior to analysis , and testing to be certain no specific researcher consistently produced data with a given bias . 4 . 1 | CaMKII and plasmalemmal sealing Ca 2 1 - influx at sites of plasmalemmal trauma activates Ca 2 1 - sensitive proteins , including those in pathways that initiate membrane sealing , causing vesicles to migrate to the wound and form a vesicular plug ( Bittner et al . , 2016 ) or wound vesicle ( Moe et al . , 2015 ) . This Ca 2 1 - influx activates calmodulin ( CaM ) to form a Ca 2 1 / calmodulin substrate , which regulates a set of enzymes including the Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase family , namely CaMKII ( Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2017 ) . When activated , CaMKII enters an auto - phosphorylative state that persists after CaM dissociation , leading to CaM - independent ( “ autonomous ” ) auto - phosphorylative activity ( Lisman et al . , 2012 ; Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2017 ) . CaMKII affects numerous targets ( Fink & Meyer , 2002 ; Hudmon & Schulman , 2002 ) involved in vesicle interactions and membrane sealing ( Steinhardt et al . , 1994 ; Detrait et al . , 2000a ; Detrait et al . , 2000b ; Yoo et al . , 2004 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . , 2012b ; Zuzek et al . , 2013 ; Bittner et al . , 2016 ) . As one example , Synap - sin I , a synaptic vesicle - associated phosphoprotein that is phosphoryl - ated on its domain D by CaMKII ( Czernik et al . , 1987 ) , is involved in synaptic vesicle release and is implicated in membrane sealing ( Stein - hardt et al . , 1994 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ) . As another example , Syntaxin I , which can bind to and be phosphorylated by CaMKII ( Ohyama et al . , 2002 ) , is necessary for membrane sealing ( Detrait et al . , 2000a ; Yoo et al . , 2004 ) . Both syntaxin and synapsin are substrates in PKA - dependent sealing pathways ( Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Bittner et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , CaMKII binds to F - actin while sequestering G - actin in the inactive state , but releases G - actin following CaM binding , leading to F - actin polymerization ( Hoffman et al . , 2013 ) . F - actin has been impli - cated in membrane sealing in Xenopus oocytes ( Mandato & Bement , 2001 ) and Drosophila embryos ( Abreu - Blanco , Verboon , Liu , Watts , & Parkhurst , 2012 ) . Other targets of CaMKII might also affect plasmalem - mal sealing , such as microtubule - associated protein Tau ( Yoshimura , Ichinose , & Yamauchi , 2003 ; Zhou et al . , 2017 ) , synaptotagmin ( Hilfiker , Pieribone , Nordstedt , Greengard , & Czernik , 1999 ; Detrait et al . , 2000a ; Detrait et al . , 2000b ; Yoo et al . , 2004 ) and synaptophysin ( Rubenstein , Greengard , & Czernik , 1993 ) . CaMKII influences mem - brane sealing in fertilized and activated sea urchin embryos and 3T3 fibroblasts , but not in unfertilized eggs ( Steinhardt et al . , 1994 ) . 4 . 2 | Inhibition of CaM kinases We report that the effects of inhibitors of CaMKII on plasmalemmal sealing depend on their mechanism of inhibition , PC time , and transec - tion distance . TatCN21 , which inhibits both CaMKII activation and autonomous auto - phosphorylative activity via T - site and kinase bind - ing ( Buard et al . , 2010 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ; Pellicena & Schulman , 2014 ) , increases sealing frequencies at shorter PC times ( Figure 2a – b ; Table 1 ) , but decreases sealing frequencies at longer PC times ( Figure 1218 | POON ET AL . 2c – e ; Table 1 ) , when compared to saline controls ( Figure 2a – e ; Table 1 ) and tatSCR ( negative analog ) controls ( Figure 2e ; Table 1 ) . When tatCN21 sealing curves at different PC times are compared relative to each other ( not to the saline controls ) against transection distance , no significant differences are found ( Figure 5b ; Supporting Table 5 ) . These data suggest that B104 cells treated with tatCN21 reach a pla - teau more rapidly than we can confidently measure ( Figure 2f ) . Unlike tatCN21 , KN - 93 inhibits CaMKII by competitively binding with its calmodulin - binding site , leaving the T - site undisturbed , but does not inhibit the autonomous auto - phosphorylative activity of CaM - KII ( Sumi et al . , 1991 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ; Pellicena & Schulman , 2014 ) . We report that KN - 93 inhibition of CaMKII significantly decreases seal - ing frequencies at (cid:1) 5min PC ( Figure 4a – e ; Table 1 ) compared to DMSO controls ( Figure 4a – e ; Table 1 ) and KN - 92 ( negative analog ) controls ( Figure 4e ; Table 1 ) . KN - 93 is not as specific as tatCN21 in its effects . For example , KN - 93 also inhibits CaMKI , CaMKIV ( Takemura et al . , 2009 ) , voltage - gated Ca 2 1 channels ( Gao et al . , 2006 ) , and voltage - gated K 1 channels ( Rezazadeh et al . , 2006 ) . STO - 609 inhibition of CaMKK , and subse - quently , CaMKI and CaMKIV ( Tokumitsu et al . , 2002 ; Vest et al . , 2010 ; Takemoto - Kimura et al . , 2017 ) , shows no significant differences against DMSO controls ( Figure 3a ; Table 1 ) . These data suggest that the effects of KN - 93 on sealing frequencies are probably not due to its inhibitory effects on targets other than CaMKII . Both tatCN21 and KN - 93 alter B104 sealing frequencies , but tatSCR , KN - 92 , and STO - 609 do not alter sealing frequencies . Given the actions of each of these substances described above , all of these data suggest that CaMKII is in one or more sealing pathways , but that CaMKI and CaMKIV are not in any sealing pathways . Additionally , both tatCN21 and KN - 93 show decreased sealing frequencies at longer PC times , relative to their respective controls . Yet , there is a very clear dif - ference between the effects of tatCN21 and KN - 93 . Considering that only tatCN21 inhibits CaMKII autophosphorylation activity , these data suggest that tatCN21 inhibition of the autonomous state of CaMKII is responsible for the increase in sealing frequencies at early PC times , relative to respective controls . The differences between the effects of tatCN21 and KN - 93 show that the role of CaMKII is multi - faceted and that this protein likely performs multiple roles in the sealing process . 4 . 3 | Low concentrations of DMSO usually enhance sealing frequency , possibly by increasing Ca 2 1 - influx DMSO is widely used as a cosolvent to enhance solvation of hydropho - bic substances in salines ( Kelava et al . , 2011 ) . However , DMSO is not biologically inert and exhibits multiple effects on cell membranes and proteins . For example , Ca 2 1 - influx can be induced by DMSO concen - trations of 282 – 563mM ( 2 – 4 % v / v ; Galvao et al . , 2014 ) . At higher concentrations , (cid:4) 10 mol % ( 4 . 3M or 30 . 6 % v / v ) , DMSO promotes the formation of water - filled membrane pores ( de M (cid:1) enorval et al . , 2012 ) . DMSO has also been shown to disrupt many proteins such as cation channels ( 0 . 1 – 2M or 0 . 71 – 14 . 2 % v / v ; Nardid , Schetinskey , & Kucher - enko , 2013 ) , cytoskeletal proteins ( 1 . 4M or 10 % v / v ; Sanger , Sanger J , Kreis , & Jockusch , 1980 ) , and albumins ( 2 . 82M or 20 % v / v ; Batista et al . , 2014 ) . At yet - higher concentrations ( 5M or 35 % v / v ) , DMSO can act as a cell - cell fusogen ( Ahkong , Fisher , Tampion , & Lucy , 1975 ) . DMSO enhances membrane sealing rates in guinea pig spinal cord axons at 704mM ( 5 % v / v ; Shi , Qiao , Emerson , & Malcom , 2001 ) and sealing frequencies in rat dorsal root axons at 70 . 4 – 704mM ( 0 . 5 – 5 % v / v ; Howard et al . , 1999 ) in low extracellular [ Ca 2 1 ] ( 200 m M ; physio - logical [ Ca 2 1 ] 5 (cid:4) 1 – 2mM ; Dulbecco & Vogt , 1954 ; Howard et al . , 1999 ) , but not in zero extracellular [ Ca 2 1 ] . Our data show that DMSO has effects on cellular processes at much lower concentrations than those previously reported . B104 cells treated with 28mM ( 0 . 2 % v / v ) DMSO usually exhibit increased sealing frequencies and rates compared to DMSO - free saline controls ( Figure 3b – e ; Table 1 ) . Furthermore , cells treated with 90 m M ( 0 . 00064 % v / v ) DMSO and transected < 50 m m from their axon hillock seal at higher frequencies than cells in DMSO - free saline ( Figure 6b ; Supporting Table 2 ) . However , at 90 m M ( 0 . 00064 % v / v ) , DMSO has no significant effect on sealing of B104 axons transected > 50 m m from their hillock ( Zuzek et al . , 2013 ) , a result we confirm ( Figure 6a ; Supporting Table 2 ) . Following axotomy , Ca 2 1 - influx occurs primarily at the site of the injury to activate cell sealing pathways ( Krause et al . , 1994 ; Bittner & Fishman , 2000 ) . We hypothesize that exposure to DMSO during or after axotomy permeabilizes the membrane to Ca 2 1 along the entire length of the cell , thereby inducing more vesicles to form and migrate to the lesion site . This effect of DMSO should have a greater impact on sealing frequencies for transections nearer to the soma compared to further from the soma , a result consistent with our data . The hypothesis that DMSO permeabilizes the plasmalemma to Ca 2 1 is fur - ther supported by studies observing changes in cytoplasmic [ Ca 2 1 ] using Ca 2 1 sensitive probes on other cell lines ( 14 . 1mM – 563mM or 0 . 1 % – 4 % v / v ; He et al . , 2012 ; > 1 . 41M or > 10 % v / v ; de M (cid:1) enorval et al . , 2012 ) . Alternatively , DMSO could decouple actin from spectrin embedded in the plasma membrane ( Sanger et al . , 1980 ; Howard et al . , 1999 ) to decrease membrane tension , a phenomenon that usually pre - cedes sealing ( Togo , Krasieva , & Steinhardt , 2000 ) . 5 | CONCLUSIONS Our results show that B104 cells serve as an effective model for exam - ining sealing of axolemmal transections , and confirm that the effects of a particular substance ( e . g . , tatCN21 , KN - 93 , DMSO ) on sealing fre - quency often depend on transection distance and PC time ( McGill et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , the effects of a particular test substance on sealing frequency depend on its mode of action ( e . g . , the inhibitions of CaMKII by tatCN21 vs . KN - 93 ) . Our data also show that DMSO , at low concentrations , has significant effects on sealing frequency that need be considered and controlled for when DMSO is used as a solvent for test substances . These data further elucidate the role of CaMKII in sealing plasmalemmal damage , a process that is essential to repairing a traumatic injury to the nervous system that commonly occurs in civilian accidents and military combat . Finally , our data herein , and in other publications , consistently show that neurons with axonal transections near the axon hillock seal more slowly with lower frequencies , and POON ET AL . | 1219 often have a higher frequency of cell death compared to those with transections further from the axon hillock ( Yoo et al . , 2004 ; Nguyen et al . , 2005 ; Spaeth et al . , 2010 ; Spaeth et al . , 2012a ; Spaeth et al . 2012b ; McGill et al . , 2016 ) .
