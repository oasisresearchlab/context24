Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 064964 Introduction Cells receive extracellular stimuli in various ways : in the form of soluble molecules ( growth factors , cytokines and hormones ) that interact with cell - surface receptors ; from adhesive interactions with the extracellular matrix ; and from cell – cell adhesions . These stimuli act to generate changes in the actin cytoskeleton at specific sites ( see Poster ) , primarily through Rho proteins . Local guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) or GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) serve to upregulate or downregulate the active levels of membrane - bound Rho proteins . In humans , ~ 20 Rho GTPases exist , of which Rho , Rac and Cdc42 remain the best studied ( for a review , see Heasman and Ridley , 2008 ) . Once activated , Rho GTPases bind to a variety of effectors , including protein kinases ( Zhao and Manser , 2005 ) and some actin - binding proteins . These directly or indirectly affect the local assembly or disassembly of filamentous ( F ) - actin . The pathways downstream of Rho that impinge on actin are the subject of this Cell Science at a Glance article . For each cellular structure in a ‘typical’ adherent cell , we have incorporated information on the specific role of Rho effectors . Some background on these effectors , their regulation and their actin - related roles is provided in the text . This article does not consider the role of Rho proteins in mediating changes in actin dynamics during the cell cycle [ for more information on this topic , see Villalonga and Ridley ( Villalonga and Ridley , 2006 ) ] or in the specialized podosome or invadopodia structures ( for reviews , see Buccione et al . , 2004 ; Linder , 2007 ; Albiges - Rizo et al . , 2009 ) . The accompanying poster shows a schematic of a migrating cell with a protruding lamellipodium , a thin sheet of cytoplasm that consists mostly of very dynamic F - actin . By using single - molecule speckle analysis of actin filament turnover in lamellipodia , Watanabe and Mitchison ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) were able to observe that these F - actin filaments are generated predominantly by polymerization at the lamellipodial tip . There is some controversy as to the arrangement of actin filaments in this ( See poster insert ) Cell Science at a Glance 679 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 680 region , but the prevailing view was , until recently , that F - actin branching mediated by the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) proteins produced a dendritic F - actin network ( see Pollard , 2007 ) . This was recently challenged by a study , in four cell types , that concluded that lamellipodial F - actin is almost exclusively unbranched ( Urban et al . , 2010 ) . This recent study suggests that the majority of ‘filament junctions’ seen by electron microscopy are in fact overlapping filaments , rather than branched end - to - side junctions . There is agreement that the force that is required for membrane extension is derived from such F - actin assembly , as discussed in the following sections . The only multiplex live - cell study of RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 activation ( Machacek et al . , 2009 ) suggests that RhoA acts to initiate protrusive events in the lamellipodial region , whereas sequential Cdc42 and Rac1 activation stabilizes the newly expanded membrane . The region immediately behind the lamellipodium , termed the lamella , is relatively flat and thin ( Heath and Holifield , 1991 ) , and actin filaments in this region ( some in combination with myosin ) undergo retrograde flow towards the cell body . The lamella is distinct from the lamellipodia because of a lower rate of F - actin flux ( Ponti et al . , 2004 ) and the presence of actomyosin filaments . Adhesion to the matrix , which is meditated through integrins , occurs both at the lamella – lamellipodial boundary ( Kaverina et al . , 2002 ) and at the lamellipodial tip ( Alexandrova et al . , 2008 ; Choi et al . , 2008 ) . These nascent adhesion complexes tend to mature to become ‘focal adhesions’ under the influence of sustained myosin II contractility ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . Actomyosin stress fibers link to these adhesions and are essential for their stability . In the lamella region , the stress fibers can be arranged orthogonal to the cell edge ( circumferential stress fibers ) , or they can extend perpendicular to the cell edge towards the nucleus or across the cell center . Actin polymerization I : promoting F - actin nucleation through formins Formins were first recognized as Rho targets in a two - hybrid screen with yeast Rho1p , which identified Bni1p ( Kohno , 1996 ) . Cells have several strategies for initiating new actin polymerization , of which formins are probably the most commonly used ( Nicholson - Dykstra et al . , 2005 ; Rafelski and Theriot , 2004 ) . The mammalian diaphanous proteins ( Dia1 , 2 and 3 ; also known as Diap or Diaph proteins ) are the best - characterized vertebrate formins , comprising one of the seven formin subfamilies ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . The defining feature of formins is the FH2 domain and the adjacent variable - length profilin - binding FH1 domain , which cooperatively mediate actin filament assembly . Most formins contain a C - terminal inhibitory autoregulation domain ( DAD ) and an N - terminal Rho - binding domain ( RBD ) embedded within the larger inhibitory domain ( DID ) , the latter of which allows auto - inhibition and can be relieved by Rho binding ( Rose et al . , 2005 ; Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . The first structure of yeast Bni1p to be determined revealed that the FH2 domain forms a dimeric ‘donut’ ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) , which probably fits around the barbed end of the actin filament ; a number of subsequent FH2 structures show the same feature . The FH2 domain can remain continually associated ( processive ) with the barbed end and elongate F - actin in the presence of barbed - end capping proteins , which are abundant in the lamellipodial region . This massive and polarized net assembly of F - actin provides the driving force for membrane extension ( Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Faix et al . , 2009 ) . Although mammalian Dia1 is activated only by the Rho family ( i . e . RhoA , B and C ) , the related Dia2 and Dia3 proteins can also be activated by Rac1 and Cdc42 ( Lammers et al . , 2008 ) . Evidence for the role of formins in filopodial production has come from a number of sources . Dictyostelium Dia2 is enriched at the tips of filopodia , and is needed for formation and maintenance of filopodia ( Schirenbeck et al . , 2005 ) ; the Dia2 protein is similarly enriched at both lamellipodia and filopodia in mammalian cells ( Yang et al . , 2007 ) . Ena - and / or vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) - null neurons are defective in neurite initiation , but can be rescued by restoring filopodia formation through ectopic expression of mammalian Dia2 ( Drees and Gertler , 2008 ) . An alternative route for generating new barbed ends involves the assembly of an actin branch on an existing filament – this occurs through the activities of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP - family verprolin - homologous ( WAVE ) proteins , as described in the next section . Actin polymerization II : WASP and WAVE complexes initiate branching The WASP and WAVE family proteins are fundamental organizers of the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotes . The Cdc42 – Rac - interactive binding ( CRIB ) domain of WASP was identified by its homology to p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) ( Symons et al . , 1996 ) ; however , WASP binds Cdc42 but not Rac1 . Both WAVE and WASP drive Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin branching , and thus rapid actin polymerization , by increasing the number of free barbed ends ( Kurisu and Takenawa , 2009 ) . They share a common C - terminal architecture : a proline - rich stretch followed by the ‘VCA’ region , which triggers actin polymerization through Arp2 / 3 , two actin - like proteins that serve as an actin pseudodimer . The C - terminal domain of ~ 20 amino acids forms an amphipathic  - helix that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Panchal et al . , 2003 ) . The WAVE2 protein has a selective role in lamellipodial dynamics compared with WAVE1 , which has a role in dorsal ruffles ( Kurisu and Takenawa , 2009 ) . Both of these WAVE proteins are constitutively incorporated into a heteropentameric complex with Rac1 - binding protein PIR121 ( also known as Sra1 and CYFIP2 ) , Nck - associated protein 1 ( Nap1 ) , Abl - interacting protein ( Abi ) 1 , 2 and 3 , and HSPC300 ( Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ) . Careful reconstitution of the WAVE regulatory complex suggests that PIR121 inhibits the WAVE VCA region , so Rac1 activation of the WAVE complex through PIR121 might be intramolecularly similar to Cdc42 - mediated WASP activation ( Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . Maximal activity of the WAVE2 complex requires simultaneous interactions with prenylated membrane - bound Rac1 and acidic phospholipids ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . Phosphorylation of the WAVE complex is also obligatory – for example , WAVE2 requires multiple casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) phosphorylation events within its VCA domain ( Pocha and Cory , 2009 ) . WASP proteins similarly form a stable one - to - one complex with WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) proteins , and require Toca - 1 ( for transactivator of cytoskeleton assembly 1 ) ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) , or its paralogs Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) or formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) , for activation . CIP4 , similar to the ubiquitous N - WASP , binds to Cdc42 - like proteins , but not Rac1 ( Aspenström , 1997 ) ; the current view is that these proteins primarily promote endocytosis . This idea arose because the yeast WASP homolog Las17p had been identified in a screen for mutants defective in endocytosis ( Naqvi et al . , 1998 ) . N - WASP probably accelerates actin polymerization near invaginating clathrin - coated pits , providing energy to pinch them off from the plasma membrane . The N - WASP – WIP complex , together with Toca - 1 or FBP17 , activates actin polymerization on phosphatidylserine - containing membranes ( Takano et al . , 2008 ) . These roles have been confirmed with the observation that mouse Cip4 - null cells have delayed and decreased endocytosis ( Feng et al . , 2010 ) . Actin depolymerization and severing by cofilin Once F - actin is formed in the cell , actin filament barbed - end capping regulates the extent of actin Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 5 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 681 filament elongation . A multitude of such binding proteins influence this process and a number are targets of Rho effector kinases ( see Pak et al . , 2008 ) . ADF / cofilin proteins are reported to increase subunit dissociation from pointed ends ( Carlier et al . , 1999 ) ; however , other studies counter this notion and suggest that cofilin acts primarily to sever F - actin and block barbed - end elongation ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Active cofilin can also dissociate or ‘strip off’ Arp2 / 3 - derived F - actin branches ( Chan et al . , 2009 ) . High levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] inactivate cofilin in vitro ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) , but the key regulation occurs by phosphorylation of Ser3 on cofilin by LIM - domain - containing kinases ( LIMKs ) and testis - specific kinases ( TESKs ) , events downstream of RhoA and Rac1 ( Nishita et al . , 2005 ; Huang et al . , 2006 ) . This inactivation of cofilin locally promotes F - actin stability and elongation . The Rho - associated protein kinases ( ROCKs or ROKs ) and PAKs activate LIMK through phosphorylation of its activation loop ( Thr508 in LIMK1 ) ( for a review , see Bernard , 2007 ) . The regulation of TESKs is not understood at all . In the lamellipodium , cofilin inactivation depends primarily on activities of Rac1 and its PAK1 and PAK2 targets ( Delorme et al . , 2007 ) . MLCK , ROCK , MRCK and PAK regulate the actomyosin network The Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain 2 ( MLC2 ) primarily on Ser19 and , to a lesser extent , on Thr18 ( Sellers et al . , 1981 ) . This affects both activity and assembly of myosin II filaments . In non - muscle cells , MLCK acts on distinct myosin II pools from ROCK ( Totsukawa et al . , 2004 ) . The long form of MLCK ( 220 kDa ) is dominant in non - muscle contexts , such as in HeLa and PTK cells ( Poperechnaya et al . , 2000 ) ; it contains multiple copies of a DxRxxL motif ( not found in the 130 kDa muscle form ) that targets MLCK to stress fibers . ROCK family members are direct targets of RhoA ( Leung et al . , 1995 ; Fujisawa et al . , 1996 ) : this kinase family includes myotonic dystrophy kinase , ROCK , myotonic - dystrophy - kinase - related Cdc42 - binding kinase ( MRCK ) and citron kinase . In addition to binding Cdc42 , the MRCK protein kinase C ( PKC ) - like C1 zinc finger binds , and is activated by , diacylglycerol , thus placing it downstream of phospholipase C ( Tan et al . , 2001 ) , in common with MLCK . The equivalent ROCK zinc finger might allow regulation by lipids , such as arachidonic acid ( Feng et al . , 1999 ) , but this has not been fully investigated . Common targets of these zinc fingers are the myosin - binding subunit ( MBS or MYPT1 ) of myosin phosphatase ( for a review , see Matsumura and Hartshorne , 2008 ) and the regulatory MLC2 protein , which controls the activity of myosin IIA and myosin IIB ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . The MBS complex is bound to RhoA , perhaps through the M - RIP adaptor ( Kimura et al . , 1996 ; Surks et al . , 2003 ) . ROCK also phosphorylates the Na + / H + antiporter NHE - 1 , which promotes the proton export essential for myosin II action ( Vexler et al . , 1996 ; Tominaga et al . , 1998 ) . The phosphorylation and inactivation of the myosin - associated phosphatase PP1  – MYPT1 complex by both ROCK and MRCK is well established ( Conti and Adelstein , 2008 ) and the notion of localized signaling networks is supported by the direct interaction of RhoA with MYPT1 ( for a review , see Ito et al . , 2004 ) . Significant direct phosphorylation of the regulatory Ser19 on MLC2 by ROCK and MRCK is also now accepted ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . To date , no phospho - rylation - specific antibodies have been reported for active forms of ROCK or MRCK , restricting information on the spatial activation of these kinases in cells . However , the effects of ROCK can be inferred from the use of the somewhat selective kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . In HeLa and U2OS cells , lamellar circumfer - ential actomyosin filaments are enriched for myosin IIA and myosin 18A , and their assembly and movement are controlled by MRCK , not ROCK ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . Myosin 18A is an unusual myosin with an actin - binding site N - terminal to the head domain ( Isogawa et al . , 2005 ) and a PDZ domain that binds the adaptor complex LRAP35a – MRCK . Knockdown of myosin18A in fact prevents the assembly of myosin IIA in the lamella region ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . MRCK  and  are ubiquitous Cdc42 effectors ; however , a common alternatively spliced MRCK  isoform with two tandem CRIB domains preferentially binds Rac1 ( Tan et al . , 2003 ) . Their link to Cdc42 and cell polarity is discussed below . Cell asymmetry and centrosomal polarity in cell migration Myosin II is important for the polarity of migrating cells ; contractility initiates the breakage of cell symmetry by forming the prospective rear , or tail , of the cell ( for a review , see Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) and protrusion at the opposite ‘leading edge’ ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2007 ) . In migrating cells , the activity of RhoA and ROCK is needed for proper regulation of tail retraction ( Pertz et al . , 2006 ) . Centrosomal polarity , by contrast , requires the activity of the Cdc42 – Par6 – aPKC – Par3 complex ( Suzuki and Ohno , 2006 ) . Cell polarity is most frequently assessed in cell scratch assays performed on confluent cell monolayers . The wound - edge cells orient their centrosomes towards the wound , a process that is easy to monitor . An existing model of this process invokes that the new extracellular matrix adhesions recruit PAR polarity proteins to the leading edge ( Schlessinger et al . , 2007 ) . However , by using cells grown on micropatterns , it has been shown that it is cell – cell contacts , rather than new integrin engagement , that allows polarization ( Desai et al . , 2009 ) . Wounding initially induces displacement of the nucleus towards remaining cell – cell contacts and away from the free edge . Although the centrosome is tethered by microtubules attached to the plasma membrane , this nuclear displacement and subsequent movement requires contractile myosin II driven by the Cdc42 effector MRCK ( Gomes et al . , 2005 ) , which probably operates through the MRCK - enriched subnuclear stress fibers . It is notable that fibroblast migration through a three - dimensional extracellular matrix requires ROCK , whereas carcinoma cells rely primarily on MRCK ( Gaggioli et al . , 2007 ) ; in other contexts , PAKs are implicated in cancer cell migration ( Molli et al . , 2009 ) . The best evidence for overlapping roles of these three kinases comes from experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans ( which only has single copies of ROCK , MRCK and PAK ) , where the combined loss of either ROCK and PAK , or ROCK and MRCK , completely prevents the embryonic elongation due to myosin II . This is persuasive genetic evidence for interplay between these three kinases in this conserved pathway ( Gally et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to controlling actomyosin contractility , ROCK and MRCK promote tethering of actin to cellular membranes , as discussed below . Tethering F - actin to different membranes through ERM , CIP4 and IRSp53 The bulk of the plasma membrane is tethered to an underlying mesh of cortical F - actin . ROCK and MRCK phosphorylate ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) family proteins to activate their function as linkers between F - actin and multiple transmembrane proteins , which stabilizes the cortical actin network ( Niggli and Rossy , 2008 ) . In their inactive conformation , the N - terminal FERM domain binds to the C - terminal actin - binding domain . Both PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to the FERM domain and ROCK phosphorylation of a crucial threonine residue stabilizes the unfolded conformation , allowing the binding of the FERM domain to transmembrane receptors . Phosphorylation of ERM proteins at filopodia induced by the Cdc42 – MRCK complex has Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 5 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 682 been reported ( Nakamura et al . , 2000 ) . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a highly charged lipid that activates or inactivates many actin - binding proteins ( Janmey and Lindberg , 2004 ) . Both Rac1 and RhoA bind to phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) ; this markedly stimulates PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis by all three PIP5K isoforms ( Weernink et al . , 2004 ) . Unfortunately , the underlying regulation of the Rho – PIP5K pathway remains unclear . Membrane - binding BAR domains can serve as sensors or promote membrane curvature ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . The CIP4 family proteins are components of the N - WASP complex ( Tian et al . , 2000 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) and contain an F - BAR domain that probably stabilizes invaginations of the plasma membrane , such as those generated during endocytosis . The Cdc42 - related TC10 protein recruits CIP4 during insulin - stimulated Glut4 translocation in adipocytes ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Remarkably , in vitro data indicate that F - BAR proteins and the N - WASP – WIP complex have the ability to ‘sense’ membrane curvature and couple this information to local actin polymerization ( Takano et al . , 2008 ) . The F - BAR domains of FBP17 and CIP4 also form filaments through end - to - end interactions that might serve to drive membrane tubulation ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . Filopodia are abundant rod - like cellular protrusions that are formed by the assembly of actin filaments bundled by fascin and assembled from a ‘tip complex’ . Filopodia can be induced by Cdc42 or Rif , and require an effector protein called insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) ( Faix and Rottner , 2006 ) . IRSp53 has an inverse ( I ) - BAR domain that binds to and stabilizes ‘bent’ cellular membranes ( in an opposing direction to CIP4 ) on protrusions such as lamellipodia and filopodia ( Scita et al . , 2008 ) . Through its SH3 domain , IRSp53 can form a complex with WAVE2 in vivo ( Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) , or with the F - actin capping protein Eps8 ( Disanza et al . , 2006 ) . The localization of IRSp53 to either lamellipodia or filopodia requires an SH3 interaction , allowing it to promote membrane bending : this is negatively regulated by phos - phorylation and binding of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins ( Robens et al . , 2010 ) , which regulate filopodial lifetime . Conclusions It is probable that the bulk of Rho effectors have now been uncovered , but much remains to be discovered about how these proteins organize actin . The main challenges are to understand the actions of these proteins in their proper cellular context and to determine the in vivo substrates for the kinase effectors of Rho proteins [ including PKN ( protein kinase N ) and MLK ( mixed - lineage kinase ) , which we have not discussed here ] . The hope is that the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by a modular set of macromolecular machines that operate in a similar manner in multiple cell types . Thus , the results obtained so far from a variety of cells grown in two - dimensional cultures would be pertinent to whole tissues and organisms .
