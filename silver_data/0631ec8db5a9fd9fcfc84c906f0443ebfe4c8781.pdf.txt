C . , T . - t . W . ) The expression of heat shock proteins ( Hsps ) induced by nonlethal heat treatment confers acquired thermotolerance ( AT ) to organisms against subsequent challenges of otherwise lethal temperature . After the stress signal is removed , AT gradually decays , with decreased Hsps during recovery . ATof sufﬁcient duration is critical for sessile organisms such as plants to survive repeated heat stress in their environment , but little is known regarding its regulation . To identify potential regulatory components , we took a reverse genetics approach by screening for Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) T - DNA insertion mutants that show decreased thermotolerance after a long recovery ( 2 d ) under nonstress conditions following an acclimation heat treatment . Among the tested mutants corresponding to 48 heat - induced genes , only the heat shock transcription factor HsfA2 knockout mutant showed an obvious phenotype . Following pretreatment at 37 (cid:2) C , the mutant line was more sensitive to severe heat stress than the wild type after long but not short recovery periods , and this could be complemented by the introduction of a wild - type copy of the HsfA2 gene . Quantitative hypocotyl elongation assay also revealed that AT decayed faster in the absence of HsfA2 . Signiﬁcant reduction in the transcript levels of several highly heat - inducible genes was observed in HsfA2 knockout plants after 4 h recovery or 2 h prolonged heat stress . Immunoblot analysis showed that Hsa32 and class I small Hsp were less abundant in the mutant than in the wild type after long recovery . Our results suggest that HsfA2 as a heat - inducible transactivator sustains the expression of Hsp genes and extends the duration of AT in Arabidopsis . Eukaryotic cells respond to elevated temperature or heat shock ( HS ) by inducing the transcription of genes encoding proteins such as molecular chape - rones . Many of these proteins are involved in prevent - ing or repairing the damage caused by heat stress and thus confer increased thermotolerance ( Lindquist and Craig , 1988 ; Vierling , 1991 ) . This phenomenon , known as HS response ( HSR ) , is initiated by the activation of the HS transcription factor ( Hsf ) , a conserved protein present in all eukaryotic organisms studied to date ( Wu , 1995 ; Nover et al . , 2001 ) . The exact number of Hsf genes differs greatly among various eukaryotic organisms . For example , Saccharo - myces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster , and Caenorhab - ditis elegans each has a single Hsf gene playing an important biological role in addition to the HSR ( Sorger and Pelham , 1988 ; Wiederrecht et al . , 1988 ; Jedlicka et al . , 1997 ; Hsu et al . , 2003 ) . The mammalian genome contains three Hsf isoforms , Hsf1 , Hsf2 , and Hsf4 , each with a distinct biological function ( Xiao et al . , 1999 ; Bu et al . , 2002 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2004 ; Xing et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to the low numbers of Hsf genes found in animals and yeasts , the model plant Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) contains 21 Hsf ho - mologs that can be sorted into three classes ( classes A , B , and C ; Nover et al . , 2001 ) . Most class A Hsfs of Arabidopsis contain the AHA motifs essential for transcription activation , while the class B and C Hsfs do not ( Kotak et al . , 2004 ) . Genetic evidence shows that HsfA1a functions as a master regulator of HSR in tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum ; Mishra et al . , 2002 ) . In Arabidopsis , HsfA1a and HsfA1b play important roles in the induction of a number of HS protein ( Hsp ) genes in the early phase of HSR ( Lohmann et al . , 2004 ) . A rice ( Oryza sativa ) mutant , spl7 , which is sensitive to envi - ronmental stress and exhibits a spotted leaf phenotype under elevated temperature , was shown to have a missense mutation in an Hsf gene belonging to the HsfA4 group ( Yamanouchi et al . , 2002 ) . Intriguingly , several plant Hsf s are HS - inducible genes themselves , which among eukaryotic systems is a feature unique to plants ( Nover et al . , 2001 ) . For example , HsfA2 is strongly induced by HS in tomato ( Scharf et al . , 1998 ) and Arabidopsis ( Busch et al . , 2005 ) . 1 This work was supported by the National Science Council ( grant nos . 91 – 3112 – P – 001 – 036 – Y and 94 – 2311 – B – 001 – 058 ) and by Acade - mia Sinica , Taiwan , ROC . 2 These authors contributed equally to the paper . * Corresponding author ; e - mail yycharng @ gate . sinica . edu . tw ; fax 886 – 2 – 2651 – 5600 .

The presence of HsfA2 exclusively after HS treatment suggests its role in the transcriptional regulation of Hsp genes during prolonged heat stress or in recovery after HS ( Baniwal et al . , 2004 ) and , hence , its importance in the development of acquired thermotolerance ( AT ) . Recently , two research groups have independently reported the function of HsfA2 by characterizing the same Arabidopsis T - DNA knockout line . Li et al . ( 2005 ) found that disruption of HsfA2 caused a slight reduction in expression of some Hsp genes upon HS treatment and that the knockout mutant displayed reduced basal and AT as well as oxidative stress tol - erance , while overexpression of HsfA2 enhances toler - ance under these stress conditions . Schramm et al . ( 2006 ) identiﬁed a subset of genes whose expression was reduced upon HS treatment in the knockout mutant . They showed that HsfA2 bound to the pro - moter regions of selected target genes and activated a b - glucuronidase ( GUS ) reporter that was fused to them . However , in contrast to the observation made by Li et al . ( 2005 ) , no obvious phenotype was observed for the mutant under the relatively comprehensive assay conditions ( Schramm et al . , 2006 ) . The discrep - ancy in these studies obscures the biological function of this important component of plant HSR . In the postgenomic era , functional study of target genes by reverse genetic approaches has become the norm , but knockout mutation often leads to no signif - icant change in phenotype . This approach is especially difﬁcult for the study of stress - induced genes because plants without these genes often show no or very subtle difference from the wild type even under the stress condition that induces them . Apparently , devel - oping a more subtle and effective assay is essential for elucidating the biological function of HSR genes be - cause so far only a few successful cases have been reported ( Hong and Vierling , 2000 ; Queitsch et al . , 2000 ; Panikulangara et al . , 2004 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Charng et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Recently , we have dem - onstrated the function of a plant - speciﬁc Hsp , Hsa32 , in Arabidopsis by employing a novel assay method ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . The mutant plants lacking Hsa32 became more sensitive to severe HS than the wild type after long ( 48 h ) but not short recovery following heat acclimation treatment , suggesting that the protein is associated with the duration of AT . AT of signiﬁcant duration is presumably an important feature for plants to cope with repeated heat stress with intervening periods of milder temperature , but very little infor - mation is available on this issue so far . Here , we report the screening of Arabidopsis T - DNA insertion mutants of 48 heat - induced genes under the same assay conditions used to characterize Hsa32 ; only the HsfA2 knockout plants showed a signiﬁcant heat - sensitive phenotype , which could be rescued by introducing a wild - type copy of HsfA2 . Physiological studies showed that HsfA2 is essential for AT after long but not short recovery . Further diag - nosis by microarray and reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR suggested that the heat - induced Hsf is not required for initial regulation of HSR genes but for sustaining the transcript level of Hsp genes during recovery and prolonged heat stress . Semiquantitative RT - PCR and immunoblot assays suggest that the cause of the phenotype was at least partly due to the reduced level of Hsps , such as Hsa32 , in the mutant after long recovery following an acclimation treatment . The re - sults not only provide direct genetic evidence of the biological function of HsfA2 but also of the existence of a regulatory component for the duration of AT , at least in Arabidopsis , but probably in other higher plants as well . RESULTS Reverse Genetic Screening for Mutants Sensitive to Severe HS after Long Recovery from Acclimation To identify genes involved in duration of AT , we took a reverse genetic approach by randomly screen - ing Arabidopsis T - DNA insertion mutants correspond - ing to 48 genes ( Table I ) , which previous microarray analyses had shown to be up - regulated by HS treat - ment ( Busch et al . , 2005 ; Charng et al . , 2006 ) . Most of the mutant lines had T - DNA inserted in the exon region of the target gene , which should have resulted in loss - of - function alleles . Homozygous lines of these mutants were isolated by PCR analysis . RT - PCR ex - periments conﬁrmed that all the T - DNA insertion lines were unable to accumulate corresponding transcripts under normal and HS conditions ( data not shown ) . Three - day - old seedlings of these mutants grown on agar plates were treated with severe HS ( 44 (cid:2) C for 50 min ) after a 2 - d recovery from previous acclimation treatment ( 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ) . These conditions killed the Hsa32 knockout but not the wild - type plants ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) that were included in each plate as positive and negative controls , respectively , to ensure the effec - tiveness of the treatment . After two rounds of screen - ing , a lethal phenotype under the test condition was repeatedly observed only for the HsfA2 T - DNA inser - tion mutant ( Fig . 1A ) . We therefore carried out further studies on this putative HsfA2 mutant . The defect of HsfA2 T - DNA insertion was associated with the homozygous line containing both disrupted HsfA2 alleles with T - DNA inserted within the second exon near the 5 # end ( Supplemental Fig . S1A ) , whereas about 75 % and 100 % of the offspring of the hemizy - gous or azygous sister lines , respectively , showed the wild - type phenotype . These results indicated that the T - DNA insertion caused a loss - of - function mutant allele , hereafter designated as hsfA2 - 1 . RT - PCR analy - sis showed that transcripts of HsfA2 were induced by HS treatment ( 37 (cid:2) C , 1 h ) in the wild type but not in the hsfA2 - 1 plants , whereas the expression of Hsa32 and Hsp101 control genes was not signiﬁcantly affected in the mutant ( Supplemental Fig . S1B ) . The RT - PCR results conﬁrmed that hsfA2 - 1 was a null mutant of HsfA2 . Because Southern - blot analysis showed that Charng et al . 252 Plant Physiol .

All rights reserved . multiple T - DNA insertion events occurred in the hsfA2 - 1 mutant line ( data not shown ) , we performed a complementation test by transforming a wild - type copy of HsfA2 genomic DNA into the knockout mutant to ensure that the observed phenotype was not caused by disruption of other genes by T - DNA or by a sec - ondary mutation in the genome of the mutant line . The introduced wild - type gene , covering a 387 - bp poten - tial promoter region ( Supplemental Fig . S1 ) , rescued the mutant phenotype of hsfA2 - 1 ( Fig . 1A ) and restored Table I .

All rights reserved . the heat - inducible expression of HsfA2 in independent transgenic lines of the T 2 generation ( Fig . 1B ) . The sur - vival rate of the thermotolerance test was about the same as the resistance rate against L - phosphinothricin ( Basta ; Hoechst AG ) , conferred by the cotransformed bar gene , in lines C112 - 1 and C112 - 2 , which suggests cosegregation of the transgene and complementation capability . Both tests yielded a survival rate close to 75 % ( Fig . 1B ) , indicating that a single T - DNA insertion event may have occurred in these transgenic lines . The results of the complementation experiment conﬁrm that disruption of HsfA2 caused the mutant phenotype observed in hsfA2 - 1 seedlings . Besides the defect in AT , hsfA2 - 1 did not exhibit an obvious phenotypic difference in morphology , germi - nation time and rate , growth rate , time to ﬂowering , and seed yield as compared to the wild type under nonstress conditions , which suggests that HsfA2 is not required for normal growth and development . HsfA2 Was Essential for the Duration But Not Induction of AT To investigate how HsfA2 was involved in the devel - opment of AT , we compared results of a thermotol - erance test between the hsfA2 - 1 mutant and the wild type as well as the T - DNA knockout mutants for Hsa32 ( hsa32 - 1 ) and Hsp101 ( hsp101 ) , which show different types of defects in AT . Hsa32 was shown to be essential for protecting Arabidopsis seedlings against severe heat stress after long but not short recovery ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) , whereas Hsp101 was shown to be required for AT developed during a short ( Hong and Vierling , 2000 ; Queitsch et al . , 2000 ) as well as a long recovery time ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . In a survival rate assay , 3 - d - old Arabidopsis seed - lings grown on solid agar medium were ﬁrst condi - tioned at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h , allowed to recover for various times at room temperature , challenged by a severe HS ( at 44 (cid:2) C for various times ) , then allowed to recover at room temperature again for more than 7 d . For the wild type , the conditioning treatment prevented the seed - lings from being killed by the severe HS , and the strength of AT gradually declined but lasted up to 72 h ( Fig . 2 , A – E ) . The hsfA2 - 1 mutant signiﬁcantly differed in survival rate from the wild type if the severe HS challenge was applied following a 2 - h ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) or 24 - h ( data not shown ) recovery , which was similar to the case for hsa32 - 1 seedlings . In contrast , the hsp101 plants undergoing the same treatment all died ( Fig . 2C ) . Similarly to the hsa32 - 1 and hsp101 mutant plants , the hsfA2 - 1 plants became more sensitive to the severe HS challenge than the wild - type plants after a 2 - to 3 - d recovery ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . However , the damage caused by the severe HS was less severe in hsfA2 - 1 than in hsa32 - 1 and hsp101 mutants . In the hsfA2 - 1 mutant population , a small number of the seedlings , despite being severely injured , managed to survive and even - tually produce true leaves , whereas the hsa32 - 1 and hsp101 plants were all dead under the same conditions ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . If the treatment time at 44 (cid:2) C was in - creased to 50 min , all the hsfA2 - 1 mutant plants would die , as shown in Figure 1 . The decreased thermotol - erance after long recovery in all the mutants , however , was reversible . A second conditioning treatment 2 h before the severe HS challenge after 72 h of recovery protected the mutant plants against severe injury ( Fig . 2F ) . These results suggest that HsfA2 is required for longer duration instead of initial induction of AT . To elucidate further details of this process , we monitored and compared the development of pheno - type in the heat - sensitive mutants after the HS regime shown in Figure 2D . The severe HS challenge did not cause any immediately observable damage in the wild - type and mutant plants , but the heat - induced injury syndrome began to develop after 2 d of recovery in the mutants ( Fig . 2G ) . The degree of injury in the hsfA2 - 1 plants seemed to be less severe than that in the hsp101 plants ( Fig . 2G ) . The hypocotyls of the hsfA2 - 1 plants looked healthier than those of the hsp101 mu - tant plants , which became severely dehydrated and wilted after 6 d of recovery . In the root , severe HS inhibited the growth of the main root in both the wild type and mutants ( Fig . 2H ) . However , vigorous ad - ventitious roots developed in the wild type but only began to emerge in the hsfA2 - 1 or did not emerge at all in the hsa32 - 1 and hsp101 mutants ( Fig . 2H ) . Ion leakage analysis ( measuring the extent of membrane Figure 1 .

All rights reserved . damage ) 2 h after the severe HS challenge showed no signiﬁcant difference between the wild type and the mutants ( Fig . 3 ) . However , ion leakage in the wild - type plants gradually decreased after 6 h of recovery , whereas that of the mutants remained high . We also examined the role of the other 47 heat - induced genes in AT during short recovery . Interest - ingly , the T - DNA insertion mutant ( SALK _ 088054 ) of a putative membrane - associated protease gene showed lethal phenotype after severe HS challenge following a short but not long recovery ( Supplemental Fig . S2 ) , in contrast to the cases of hsfA2 - 1 and hsa32 - 1 . These results revealed the temporal roles of these genes during the development of AT and that the function of HsfA2 speciﬁcally affects AT at a later phase . AT Declined Faster in the Absence of HsfA2 Quantitative hypocotyl elongation assay was per - formed as previously described to determine the decay rate of AT ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , we measured the elongation of hypocotyls of vertically grown etiolated seedlings after severe HS challenge ( 44 (cid:2) C for 45 min ) following conditioning treatment at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h . The recovery time between the condition - ing and HS challenge was varied to reveal the kinetics Figure 2 . hsfA2 - 1 plants were less tolerant than wild type to severe HS challenge after a long but not short recovery following acclimation treat - ment .

Hypocotyls could not elon - gate if they were directly challenged without con - ditioning . Figure 4A shows the baseline of hypocotyl elongation after various recovery times following con - ditioning treatment , and no signiﬁcant difference was observed among the hsfA2 - 1 , hsp101 , hsa32 - 1 , and wild - type plants in the absence of severe HS treatment . Con - sistent with the results of survival rate assay , hsfA2 - 1 plants showed a signiﬁcant decrease in hypocotyl elongation after the severe HS challenge applied dur - ing long ( . 24 h ) but not short ( , 12 h ) recovery times ( Fig . 4B ) . After challenge at 48 h of recovery , the hsfA2 - 1 plants still showed some growth , while the hsa32 - 1 and hsp101 plants showed no further growth . This obser - vation agreed with the survival rate data ( Fig . 2 ) , which suggests that HsfA2 is essential for extending the duration but not the initial induction of AT . hsfA2 - 1 Showed Slightly Increased Sensitivity to HS without Acclimation We also employed the hypocotyl elongation and survival rate assay to determine whether HsfA2 is required for basal thermotolerance , deﬁned as the capability to tolerate severe heat stress without prior conditioning that induces HSR . We measured the length of hypocotyls elongated for 3 d after the appli - cation of a short pulse of severe HS ( 5 min at 46 (cid:2) C – 50 (cid:2) C or 15 – 30 min at 44 (cid:2) C ) . During the short treatment at 44 (cid:2) C or above , the expression of the strongly heat - induced genes , such as Hsp25 . 3 - P and Hsp18 . 1 - CI , was not invoked ( data not shown ) . Figure 5 shows that direct challenge by severe HS increasingly retarded hypocotyl growth of the etiolated seedlings , both with increased treatment time ( Fig . 5A ) or temperature ( Fig . 5B ) in all plants . However , only a small difference was observed between the wild - type and hsfA2 - 1 plants , whereas the growth of the hsp101 and hsa32 - 1 plants was severely inhibited ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . In a sur - vival rate assay ( treatment at 44 (cid:2) C for various times ) , we did not observe any signiﬁcant difference between the hsfA2 - 1 mutant and wild - type plants . These data suggest that Hsa32 and Hsp101 are required for basal thermotolerance , while HsfA2 is minimally involved . Figure 3 . Ion leakage of the wild type and mutants . Seedlings 3 d old were conditioned at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h , recovered at room temperature for 2 d , and then challenged by 44 (cid:2) C for 45 min .

In addition , when grown under continual moderate heat stress ( see ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ for condi - tion ) , no obvious phenotypic difference was observed between the wild - type and hsfA2 - 1 seedlings . Disruption of HsfA2 Lowered Expression Levels of Heat - Induced Genes during Recovery and Prolonged Heat Stress Because AtHsfA2 was previously shown to have transcription factor activity ( Port et al . , 2004 ; Schramm et al . , 2006 ) , disruption of HsfA2 may have signiﬁ - cantly compromised the expression of certain Hsp genes during recovery , which in turn shortened the duration of AT . However , we could not exclude the possibility that the initial induction of some heat - induced genes required HsfA2 , which may be present at a very low level without HS . First , we compared the transcriptome proﬁles of the wild - type and hsfA2 - 1 seedlings after treatment at 37 (cid:2) C ( HS ) or 24 (cid:2) C ( control ) for 1 h with use of the Affymetrix ATH1 22 K chip , which contains 22 , 500 probe sets representing approx - imately 24 , 000 genes of the Arabidopsis genome . The correlation of the two biological replicates in each sample was relatively high ( R . 0 . 96 ; Supplemental Fig . S3A ) . No major difference ( 3 - fold or larger ) was observed between the wild - type and mutant plants in the hybridization signals , both HS and control , in expression for all genes , including members of the Hsf family , except HsfA2 ( Supplemental Fig . S3B ) . Because the phenotype of hsfA2 - 1 was manifested after the severe HS challenge after 48 h or longer recovery , we used the ATH1 chip to query the tran - scriptome proﬁles of the wild - type and the mutant seedlings harvested right after the treatment at 44 (cid:2) C for 45 min in the HS regime indicated in Figure 2D . Control samples were seedlings of the same age but without both the conditioning and severe HS treat - ment . Microarray data revealed only a few genes showing signiﬁcantly lower HS to control signal ratio in the mutant than in the wild type in two biological repeats . Hsp18 . 1 - CI ( previously known as Hsp18 . 2 ; Takahashi and Komeda , 1989 ) and Hsp25 . 3 - P ( previ - ously known as Hsp21 ; Osteryoung et al . , 1993 ) were the most affected ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . The small number of affected genes was probably due to the time point chosen for the microarray study , when the transcript levels of other Hsp genes were too low to show a difference after the long recovery . Because the expression of Hsp18 . 1 - CI and Hsp25 . 3 - P was not in - duced by severe HS at 44 (cid:2) C for 45 min in the wild - type and mutant plants ( data not shown ) , abundance of the transcripts of these genes probably declined faster in hsfA2 - 1 than in the wild type during recovery . Thus , we examined the transcript level of Hsp18 . 1 - CI , Hsp25 . 3 - P , Hsa32 , and Hsp101 by semiquantitative RT - PCR during the course of recovery ( 0 – 48 h ) after conditioning at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ( Fig . 6A ) . Apart from Hsp101 , these genes have been shown to be the poten - tial targets of HsfA1a / b in Arabidopsis because in the HsfA1a and HsfA1b double knockout mutant their expression was signiﬁcantly suppressed in response to HS ( Busch et al . , 2005 ) . Directly after the condition - ing treatment or within 2 h of recovery , the mRNA levels of all Hsps tested differed little , which was consistent with the microarray data ( Supplemental Fig . S3A ) . However , the transcript levels of Hsp18 . 1 , Hsp25 . 3 - P , and Hsa32 were substantially lower in the hsfA2 - 1 than in the wild - type plants after 4 h of re - covery , with no signiﬁcant difference found for Hsp101 transcript ( Fig . 6A ) . Western - blot analysis showed that after 48 h of recovery , the levels of Hsa32 and sHsp - CI proteins of hsfA2 - 1 were lower than in the wild type ( Fig . 6B ) , consistent with the transcript levels . To determine whether HsfA2 is also required for the duration of HSR under prolonged HS , we also exam - ined the transcript levels of Hsp18 . 1 - CI , Hsp25 . 3 - P , Hsa32 , and Hsp101 in seedlings subjected to continu - ous heat treatment at 37 (cid:2) C for up to 8 h . RT - PCR analysis again revealed no signiﬁcant difference in transcript levels of these genes within the ﬁrst hour of HS treatment but signiﬁcantly lowered levels in mu - tant plants after 2 h of prolonged HS ( Fig . 7 ) . However , no difference in protein levels of Hsa32 and sHsp - CI was detected in these samples ( data not shown ) , Figure 5 . Disruption of HsfA2 caused a slight reduction in basal thermotolerance . A , Etiolated seedlings 3 d old underwent direct , severe HS challenge at 44 (cid:2) C for 15 to 30 min or , in B , 46 (cid:2) C to 50 (cid:2) C for 5 min . After HS challenge , the seedlings were labeled for position of hypocotyls and then allowed to grow vertically for another 3 d in the dark . The elongation of hypocotyls after HS was expressed as a percentage of that of the nontreated control ( C ) . Each data point represents the mean of 25 seedlings . Error bars represent SD based on data in ﬁve separate duplicates of the mean of ﬁve seedlings . The plants with asterisks had signiﬁcantly lower values than wild - type plants ( P , 0 . 05 , independent Student’s t test ) . HsfA2 Extends Duration of Acquired Thermotolerance Plant Physiol .

All rights reserved . perhaps due to the stability and / or lower saturation threshold of the amount of mRNA actively engaged in translation of these proteins under continuous heat . These data again suggest that HsfA2 is not required for the initial induction but , rather , for the transcription of certain heat - induced genes during recovery or pro - longed HS . DISCUSSION In an attempt to identify genetic components in - volved in the regulation of the duration of AT , we tested T - DNA insertion mutant lines corresponding to 48 heat - induced genes ( Table I ) by a HS regime that applied severe heat stress after 2 d of recovery from acclimation to mild heat stress . Under this condition , the HsfA2 knockout line , hsfA2 - 1 , exhibited a severely heat - sensitive phenotype ( Fig . 1A ) , while all the other mutants were not substantially different from the wild type . The results suggest that all of these genes except HsfA2 were not essential for AT duration . Gene re - dundancy or existence of alternative pathways may explain why some of these mutants did not show a thermotolerance defect under the test conditions . Al - ternatively , they may be essential for tolerance against heat stress of different magnitude , in combination with other stresses , or at different stages of AT devel - opment . Indeed , the ﬁnding of a T - DNA knockout mutant of a putative membrane - associated protease gene , which is sensitive to severe HS challenge after a short but not long recovery following acclimation ( Supplemental Fig . S2 ) , suggests the existence of dis - tinct stages of AT development during recovery in - volving different HSR genes . Investigation of this protease mutant is currently under way . Further characterization of hsfA2 - 1 revealed that HsfA2 was dispensable in the development of AT dur - ing the early phase ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) . It appears that the gene is essential in extending the duration of AT but not for its induction . The distinct phenotype of hsfA2 - 1 was in good agreement with the transcriptomic , Figure 7 . Transcript level of Hsp genes was lower in hsfA2 - 1 than in wild type during prolonged HS . Semiquantitative RT - PCR analysis of the mRNA levels of Hsp101 , Hsa32 , Hsp25 . 3 - P , and Hsp18 . 1 - CI in the wild - type ( wt ) and hsfA2 - 1 ( m ) plants during pro - longed HS , from 0 to 8 h , at 37 (cid:2) C . Total RNA was puriﬁed from 3 - d - old seedlings after treatment . The RT - PCR products of actin were shown as a loading control .

Similar results were obtained from two biological repeats , with one shown here . Figure 6 .

Rubisco large subunit stained by Amido black was shown to ensure equal loading . The control ( C ) samples were seedlings without heat treatment and collected at the same time as the treated samples at 72 h . Similar results were obtained from two biological repeats , with one shown here . Charng et al . 258 Plant Physiol .

RT - PCR , and immunoblot results . According to micro - array analysis , disruption of HsfA2 did not signiﬁ - cantly affect the transcript levels of other genes under normal conditions or after 37 (cid:2) C treatment for 1 h . Consistently , RT - PCR semiquantitative analysis indi - cated that HS induction of several tested Hsp genes was not affected in the absence of HsfA2 in the early phase ( Figs . 6 and 7 ) . However , in the hsfA2 - 1 mutant , the level of the mRNA of Hsp genes , most prominently Hsp25 . 3 - P and Hsa32 , declined faster than that in the wild type during the recovery period ( Fig . 6A ) . The protein level of Hsa32 in hsfA2 - 1 plants was consistent with the transcript result but declined more slowly than the transcripts ( Fig . 6B ) , probably because of its stability . The time course of the changes in protein levels correlates well with the development of the mutant phenotype ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) . Hsa32 is a novel Hsp mainly found in land plants ( Liu et al . , 2006b ) whose molecular function is currently unknown ( Liu et al . , 2006a ) . It was previously shown to be essential for AT after long recovery ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . There - fore , the heat - sensitive phenotype of hsfA2 - 1 could be attributed in part to the lower Hsa32 level in the mu - tant than in the wild type after 48 h of recovery . The lower transcript abundance of other Hsp genes , such as Hsp25 . 3 - P and Hsp18 . 1 - CI , in the mutant during re - covery ( Fig . 6A ) may result in lower levels of encoded proteins and thus lead to a defect in thermotolerance . However , a T - DNA insertion mutant of Hsp18 . 1 - CI ( SALK _ 042001 ) did not show a heat - sensitive pheno - type under the tested condition ( Table I ; data not shown ) , which may be due to gene redundancy of class I small Hsps in Arabidopsis ( Scharf et al . , 2001 ) or that this gene plays a relatively minor role in AT after long recovery . Our results were consistent with the data of the transcriptome analysis of hsfA2 - 1 by Schramm et al . ( 2006 ) , in which the transcript levels of Hsa32 , Hsp25 . 3 - P , and Hsp18 . 1 - CI were substan - tially affected after a repeated HS ( 42 (cid:2) C for 1 – 3 h ) treatment . Several groups ( Panchuk et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Miller and Mittler , 2006 ) have reported the connection between plant Hsf and oxidative stress . Studies on transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing AtHsfA1b sug - gest that Hsf is involved in the induction of Apx2 , which encodes the cytosolic hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) scavenging enzyme , ascorbate peroxidase ( Panchuk et al . , 2002 ) . In the studies of Schramm et al . ( 2006 ) , the heat - induction of Apx2 is totally abolished by disrup - tion of HsfA2 . Moreover , a GUS reporter gene fused to the Apx2 promoter can be transactivated by cotrans - fecting with AtHsfA2 driven by cauliﬂower mosaic virus 35S promoter in tobacco protoplasts . These re - sults suggest that Apx2 is a potential target of HsfA2 . However , it is not clear why the initial induction of Apx2 is abolished in the mutant after treatment at 44 (cid:2) C for 1 h when HsfA2 was absent in the wild - type plants ( Schramm et al . , 2006 ) . In our case , the induction of Apx2 by HS treatment ( 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ) was not affected by the absence of HsfA2 , as revealed by microarray and RT - PCR analysis , although it was greatly sup - pressed in the mutant during recovery and prolonged HS ( Supplemental Fig . S4 ) . Heat stress induces pro - duction of H 2 O 2 ( Vacca et al . , 2004 ; Volkov et al . , 2006 ) that causes oxidative stress to the cell . HS - induced Apx2 may be required to remove the reactive oxygen species by compensating the activity of thermolabile Apx1 ( Panchuk et al . , 2002 ) . The H 2 O 2 level was shown to be higher in the HsfA2 knockout mutant than in the wild - type plants after HS treatment , and the mutant is more sensitive to oxidative stress ( Li et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that the decreased Apx2 expression may be responsible . However , we did not observe a substan - tial decrease of AT in the Arabidopsis knockout mu - tant of Apx2 after short or long recovery ( Table I ; data not shown ) , which suggests that suppression of the HS - induced reactive oxygen species scavenger alone does not account for the phenotype of hsfA2 - 1 . According to the transcriptome studies of Busch et al . ( 2005 ) , six Hsf genes , HsfA2 , HsfA4a , HsfA7a , HsfB1 , HsfB2a , and HsfB2b , are signiﬁcantly up - regulated in Arabidopsis leaves ( ecotype Wassilewskija , 5 – 6 weeks old ) by HS treatment ( 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ) . This result is comparable to our microarray data ( Supplemental Fig . S3B ) , except that in our Arabidopsis sample ( eco - type Columbia [ Col - 0 ] 5 - d - old seedlings ) , HsfA7b but not HsfA4a was signiﬁcantly responsive to heat . Our results are consistent with the microarray data gener - ated by von Koskull - Doring’s group for heat - stress response of Arabidopsis ( ecotype Col - 0 , 16 - d - old seed - lings ) at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h , which was examined using the Genevestigator tool ( Zimmermann et al . , 2004 ) . This discrepancy may result from the use of different Arabidopsis ecotypes or different growth stages or condition of the plants . Nevertheless , the presence of multiple heat - inducible Hsfs in Arabidopsis suggests that there exists a complex feedback control of plant HSR after its initial induction . Our microarray data revealed no signiﬁcant alteration of the expression of other Hsfs under normal and HS conditions ( 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ) in the hsfA2 - 1 mutant ( Supplemental Fig . S3 ) . Although amino acid comparison of DNA - binding domains and HR - A / B regions showed HsfA2 and HsfA7a / b to have a close phylogenetic relationship ( Nover et al . , 2001 ) , the loss of HsfA2 apparently could not be compensated by the presence of these two heat - induced A - type Hsfs . HsfA2 and other Hsfs may not be functionally redundant because of their differences in structure ( Nover et al . , 2001 ) . The dominance of HsfA2 following HS treatment may be another possi - bility ( Baniwal et al . , 2004 ) . From the HSR microarray data available to date , HsfA2 is the gene most induced by heat , which suggests a dominant role for the gene in sustaining the HSR , a role that cannot be replaced by HsfA7a and HsfA7b . This idea is supported by the observations that the T - DNA knockout lines of HsfA7a and HsfA7b did not show a thermotolerance defect like that of hsfA2 - 1 ( Table I ; data not shown ) . The heat - induced B - type Hsfs ( HsfB1 , HsfB2a , and HsfB2b ) , which lack the transactivation domain ( Nover HsfA2 Extends Duration of Acquired Thermotolerance Plant Physiol . Vol . 143 , 2007 259 www . plantphysiol . org on July 18 , 2017 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists . All rights reserved . et al . , 2001 ) , may play a different role from that of HsfA2 . Tomato HsfB1 , not a transcription activator by itself , synergistically enhances the transactivation ac - tivity of LeHsfA1 and LeHsfA2 on the expression of a reporter gene driven by a HS promoter ( Bharti et al . , 2004 ) . However , despite close homology with tomato HsfB1 ( Nover et al . , 2001 ) , AtHsfB1 was shown to suppress the expression of heat - inducible reporter gene when transiently coexpressed with AtHsfA4a ( Czarnecka - Verner et al . , 2000 ) . It is possible that HsfB1 acts differentially as a positive or negative transcrip - tion coactivator of some members of the Hsf family . The T - DNA knockout line of HsfB1 did not show ther - motolerance defect like hsfA2 - 1 under our test condi - tion ( Table I ; data not shown ) , suggesting that HsfB1 is not essential for extending the duration of AT like HsfA2 does . This is consistent with our observation that the expression of Hsa32 , Hsp25 . 3 - P , and Hsp18 . 1 - CI was not substantially affected in the HsfB1 T - DNA knockout mutant during recovery or prolonged heat stress , unlike in the knockout mutant hsfA2 - 1 ( N . - y . Liu and Y . - y . Charng , unpublished data ) . The function of AtHsfB2a / b is currently not clear . No signiﬁcant heat - sensitive phenotype was observed for the AtHsfB2b knockout line ( Table I ; data not shown ) , probably due to functional redundancy with AtHsfB2a , for which we did not obtain a knockout mutant . In Arabidopsis , HsfA1a / b were shown to be the ma - jor transactivators of heat - induced genes in the early phase of AT . The double knockout mutant of AtHsf - A1a / b failed to accumulate the wild - type level of mRNA of a number of heat - induced genes when treated at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ( Busch et al . , 2005 ) , but when the HS was lengthened to 2 h , the transcripts of several monitored Hsp genes except Hsp18 . 2 ( At5g59720 ) reached approximately the same levels as in the wild type ( Lohmann et al . , 2004 ) . This observation suggests that other Hsfs , such as HsfA2 , act as major trans - activators during prolonged heat stress . This hypoth - esis is supported by the ﬁnding that in the absence of HsfA2 , the expression of tested Hsp genes was sub - stantially lower than in the wild type after 2 h of pro - longed HS ( Fig . 7 ) . HsfA2 acting as a transactivator has been well characterized by previous studies ( Boscheinen et al . , 1997 ; Rojas et al . , 2002 ; Kotak et al . , 2004 ; Schramm et al . , 2006 ) . It is tempting to speculate that HsfA1s initiates HSR by inducing downstream genes , includ - ing HsfA2 , which then acts as a positive feedback regulator to sustain the expression of heat - induced genes during recovery or prolonged HS . However , it is to be noted that induction of tomato HsfA2 by HS requires HsfA1a ( Mishra et al . , 2002 ) , but in Arabi - dopsis induction of HsfA2 seems to be independent of HsfA1a / b ( Busch et al . , 2005 ) . Whether the other two A1 - type Hsfs , HsfA1d / HsfA1e , are responsible for the heat induction of HsfA2 is currently not known . Our preliminary data showed that neither the HsfA1d nor HsfA1e knockout led to alteration of the heat - induced expression of HsfA2 . Further study on a double knock - out line of these two genes is under way . Given the status of HsfA2 as a heat - inducible gene and its function in sustaining the expression level of tested Hsp genes ( Figs . 6 and 7 ) , the role of HsfA2 in extending the duration but not in induction of AT is conceivable . This inference is well supported by the immunoblot result of Schramm et al . ( 2006 ) that HsfA2 is a heat - inducible protein greatly accumulated in leaves after 3 h of HS at 42 (cid:2) C . Their data show no or very low abundance of HsfA2 protein without HS or after 1 h of HS , which is in good agreement with our conclusion that HsfA2 is not involved in the initial induction of HSR and AT developed at early phase . This explains why the mutant did not show heat - sensitive phenotype when a short recovery was asso - ciated with acclimation treatment both in this study as well as in that of Schramm et al . ( 2006 ) . However , these observations were not in agreement with the results of Li et al . ( 2005 ) , who also studied the function of HsfA2 using the same T - DNA knockout line ( SALK _ 008978 ) . In their study , the mutant plants displayed signiﬁ - cantly reduced AT , but their thermotolerance pheno - type was demonstrated under rather different conditions ( in 7 - d - old seedlings , acclimatized at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h , then challenged at 46 (cid:2) C for 2 h without recovery ) . In addition , basal thermotolerance of the mutant was also reduced . The authors then showed that the HS ( 37 (cid:2) C ) - induced transcript levels of Hsp70 ( At3g12580 ) and Hsp101 ( At1g74310 ) in the HsfA2 knockout mutant were substantially reduced . These results are inconsistent with the data reported here and by Schramm et al . ( 2006 ) , in which the expression of most genes , including Hsp70 and Hsp101 , were not changed and no signiﬁcant thermotolerance defect was observed in the mutant after short recovery or without acclimation . One possible cause of this dis - crepancy may be the different methods or apparatus used for thermotolerance assay . Alternatively , the dis - crepancy may be due to different T - DNA insertion numbers in the knockout mutants that we used . We did observe multiple copies of T - DNA in homozygous hsfA2 - 1 plants by Southern blot ( data not shown ) , and segregation of these T - DNA insertions in its offspring may have resulted in different genetic backgrounds that lead to weaker stress tolerance in some of them . Unfortunately , a complementation experiment was not conducted by Li et al . ( 2005 ) to exclude this possibility . Taken together , our results suggest that HsfA2 is one of the components involved in extending the duration of AT in plants by positively regulating the expression of at least some , if not all , heat - induced genes after their initial induction by HsfA1 ( s ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Materials , Transformation , and Growth Condition The Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) Col - 0 HsfA2 ( At2g26150 ) T - DNA insertion line SALK _ 008978 ( Alonso et al . , 2003 ) was obtained from the Arabi - dopsis Biological Resource Center ( ABRC ; Ohio State University ) . The T - DNA insertion lines SALK _ 066374 for Hsp101 ( At1g74310 ) and GABI - Kat 268A08 Charng et al . 260 Plant Physiol .

All rights reserved . for Hsa32 ( At4g21320 ) were obtained as previously described ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . Information on all the other T - DNA insertion lines obtained fromABRC or GABI - Kat program ( Rosso et al . , 2003 ) is given in Table I . The T - DNA insertions were conﬁrmed by PCR ampliﬁcation , and then homozygous lines of the mutant allele were isolated . The design of PCR primers and isolation of homozygous line involved use of the SIGnAL T - DNA Express Arabidopsis gene mapping tool of the Salk Institute ( http : / / signal . salk . edu / tdnaprimers . 2 . html ) . The sequence and PCR conditions for all the gene - speciﬁc primers usedinthisstudyaregivenin Supplemental TableS2 . Forcomplementationof the hsfA2 - 1 line , the genomic DNA of Arabidopsis wild - type ( Col - 0 ) HsfA2 was ampliﬁed by PCR with a pair of gene - speciﬁc primers ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . The 2 , 177 - bp PCR product was cloned into pCR8 / GW / TOPO ( Invitrogen ) , then sequenced to conﬁrm no missense or nonsense mutation in coding regionor any point mutation in the promoter region . The cloned HsfA2 genomic DNAwas then subcloned into pBGW , 0 ( Karimi et al . , 2005 ) by an in vitro recombinase method to yield the binary vector pYC112 , which was then transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain for Arabidopsis ( Col - 0 ) transformation by the ﬂoral dip method ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) . Transformants were selected on 0 . 5 3 Murashige and Skoog medium plates containing 25 m g / mL Basta . T2 seeds of independent lines underwent herbi - cide resistance and thermotolerance tests . For propagating seeds , Arabidopsis plantsin soilweregrownin walk - in growthchambers at22 (cid:2) Cand16hoflight ( 120 m mol m 2 2 s 2 1 ) . Thermotolerance Test All the knockout lines were grown under the same condition as the wild - type plants for harvesting seeds for thermotolerance test . For the AT test on Arabidopsis seedlings , survival rate and quantitative hypocotyl elongation assay were performed as previously described ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . A modi - ﬁed quantitative hypocotyl elongation assay was applied to evaluate the basal thermotolerance of etiolated seedlings . The seeds were sown and grown vertically in the dark for 3 d at 24 (cid:2) C , and then the plants were heated in a water bath at 44 (cid:2) C for 15 to 30 min or at 46 (cid:2) C to 50 (cid:2) C for 5 min . After this heat treatment , the hypocotyl positions were labeled . The plants were kept grown vertically for 3 d at 24 (cid:2) C , and then the length of hypocotyl elongation was measured . To evaluate the effect of continuously moderate heat stress , 3 - d - old seedlings were grown on agar plate up to 3 weeks in growth chambers with temperature set at 35 (cid:2) C during the light period ( 16 h , 120 mmol m 2 2 s 2 1 ) and 33 (cid:2) C during the dark period . Measurement of Ion Leakage Three - day - oldseedlingswereconditionedat37 (cid:2) Cfor1h , recoveredfor2d , and then heated at 44 (cid:2) C for 45 min . At each time point during the recovery after 44 (cid:2) C HS , 30 seedlings were collected and immersed in 5 mL of deionized water . The samples were kept at room temperature for 5 h , then ion leakage level was measured by a conductivity meter ( model no . SC - 120 , Suntex ) . The seedlings were autoclaved and the total ion leakage was measured . The relative ion leakage was calculated as ( ion leakage level / total ) 3 100 % . RNA Isolation and RT - PCR Analysis Total RNAwas isolated with TRIZOL reagent ( Invitrogen ) from plant sam - ples frozen in liquid nitrogen according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The presence or absence of transcript of the genes listed in Table I was analyzed by RT - PCR using RNA isolated from the wild - type and mutant plants with or without HS ( 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h ) . The sequences of the primers for this purpose were shown in Supplemental Table S2 . Semiquantitative RT - PCR analysis of the marker Hsp genes was performed basically as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) . The sequences of the primers for RT - PCR analysis for each gene are also described in Supplemental Table S2 . PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide . Florescence images of PCR products were digitized and quantiﬁed with Image Gauge Version 3 . 12 ( Fujiﬁlm ) . Microarray Analysis Transcriptome proﬁling was performed by use of the ATH1 GeneChip array ( Affymetrix ) as previously described ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . For each treatment , two biological replicates and one chip for each replicate were used . The microarray data were processed and analyzed by use of Spotﬁre DecisionSite 8 . 0 as previously described ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . The microarray data reported here were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( GSE4760 ) . Immunoblotting The total proteins of plant samples were extracted and quantiﬁed and then underwent immunoblot analysis for Hsp90 , Hsa32 , and sHsp - CI as described previously ( Charng et al . , 2006 ) . Supplemental Data The following materials are available in the online version of this article . Supplemental Figure S1 . Schematic structure of HsfA2 gene carrying the T - DNA insertion and lack of HsfA2 expression in the hsfA2 - 1 mutant . Supplemental Figure S2 . The SALK _ 088054 line was more sensitive than the wild type to severe HS challenge after a short but not long recovery following acclimation treatment . Supplemental Figure S3 .
