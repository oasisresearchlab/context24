The title for this Special Section is Meta - analysis and Individual Participant Data Synthesis in Child Development , edited by Glenn I . Roisman and Marinus H . van IJzendoorn The Development of Children ’ s Gender - Science Stereotypes : A Meta - analysis of 5 Decades of U . S . Draw - A - Scientist Studies David I . Miller , Kyle M . Nolla , Alice H . Eagly , and David H . Uttal Northwestern University This meta - analysis , spanning 5 decades of Draw - A - Scientist studies , examined U . S . children ’ s gender - science stereotypes linking science with men . These stereotypes should have weakened over time because women ’ s representation in science has risen substantially in the United States , and mass media increasingly depict female scientists . Based on 78 studies ( N = 20 , 860 ; grades K - 12 ) , children ’ s drawings of scientists depicted female scientists more often in later decades , but less often among older children . Children ’ s depictions of sci - entists therefore have become more gender diverse over time , but children still associate science with men as they grow older . These results may re ﬂ ect that children observe more male than female scientists in their envi - ronments , even though women ’ s representation in science has increased over time . Adults in many nations associate science with men much more than with women ( e . g . , Miller , Eagly , & Linn , 2015 ; Smyth & Nosek , 2015 ) . To investigate the origins of these associations , researchers have studied children ’ s perceptions of scientists over sev - eral decades . For instance , children were asked to draw a scientist in a landmark study of nearly 5 , 000 elementary school students who were mostly from the United States and Canada ( Chambers , 1983 ) . The drawings , collected from 1966 to 1977 , almost exclusively depicted male scientists , often with lab coats , eyeglasses , and facial hair , working indoors with laboratory equipment . Only 28 chil - dren drew a female scientist ( 0 . 6 % of the sample ) , suggesting strong gender - science stereotypes link - ing science with men . This limited view of scientists might have restricted children ’ s science - related edu - cational and career aspirations , to the extent that children did not identify with such depictions . Since Chambers ( 1983 ) collected data in the 1960s and 1970s , however , women ’ s representation in science has risen substantially in the United States . For instance , women earned 19 % of U . S . chemistry bachelor ’ s degrees in 1966 but 48 % of such degrees in 2015 ( National Science Foundation , 2017 ) . Female scientists are also now more often depicted in popular children ’ s television shows ( Long et al . , 2010 ) , science textbooks ( Pienta & Smith , 2012 ) , magazines such as Highlights for Chil - dren ( Previs , 2016 ) , and other mass media products ( Steinke , 2013 ) . We studied how children ’ s gender - science stereotypes have changed over 5 decades by meta - analyzing the expansive literature of U . S . Draw - A - Scientist studies . Individual studies are often uninformative in studying cultural change because they typically include only one point in time or one cohort . Meta - analytic methods , however , can over - come this limitation by comparing children across multiple decades . Moreover , this drawing task has been widely administered in grade levels varying from early elementary school to late high school , allowing us to study both developmental and his - torical change in the same meta - analysis .

In general , stereotypes about social groups form based on people ’ s direct observations of group members , such as through social interac - tions , and indirect observations , such as through mass media ( Bigler & Liben , 2007 ; Koenig & Eagly , 2014 ) . Because gender is a particularly salient social identity , children actively search their environment for cues to what activities are considered appropri - ate for boys and girls ( Arthur , Bigler , Liben , Gelman , & Ruble , 2008 ; Martin & Ruble , 2004 ) . Although some gender stereotypes start to form as early as toddlerhood , the stereotype of scientists as male should emerge somewhat later because preschoolers likely have limited knowledge of scien - tists ( Lee , 2010 ; Newton & Newton , 1992 , ﬁ gures 1 , 2 ) . Formal science instruction is sporadic in early ele - mentary school and often does not begin systemati - cally until late elementary school to middle school ( Smith , Banilower , McMahon , & Weiss , 2002 ) . Dur - ing formal science instruction , children could form gender stereotypes about science and mathematics partly based on teachers ’ attitudes and beliefs , as some correlational studies have suggested ( Keller , 2001 ; for a review , see Gunderson , Ramirez , Levine , & Beilock , 2012 ) . As children grow older , their opportunities for learning stereotypes about scien - tists also expand beyond school . For instance , middle school children have reported basing their drawings of scientists on media sources such as television shows , movies , books , and magazines ( Fort & Var - ney , 1989 ; Steinke et al . , 2007 ) . These mass media products have usually depicted many more male than female scientists , at least in prior decades ( for a review , see Steinke , 2013 ) . Children may then learn to associate science with men as their exposure to male scientists accumulates during development . We therefore predicted that older children in our meta - analysis would draw male scientists more often than younger children . Change Over Time Even in recent decades , children would likely learn to associate science with men because women remain underrepresented in many science and engi - neering ﬁ elds ( Ceci , Ginther , Kahn , & Williams , 2014 ) . However , women ’ s representation in science has also increased substantially in the United States over the past 5 decades ( Miller & Wai , 2015 ) . For instance , from 1960 to 2013 , the percentage of women among employed U . S . scientists rose from 28 % to 49 % in biological science , 8 % to 35 % in chemistry , and 3 % to 11 % in physics and astron - omy ( Hill , Corbett , & St . Rose , 2010 , ﬁ gure 11 ; National Science Board , 2016 , appendix table 3 – 12 ) . Furthermore , female scientists are now depicted more often in children ’ s media . For instance , women and girls were 13 % of images of people in science feature stories in the popular magazine Highlights for Children in the 1960s , but this percent - age rose to 44 % by the 2000s ( Previs , 2016 ) . Like - wise , women and girls were 39 % of images of scientists in children ’ s non ﬁ ction trade books pub - lished in 1991 – 2011 ( Rawson & McCool , 2014 ) , 44 % of images of scientists in middle school science text - books published in 2008 ( Pienta & Smith , 2012 ) , and 42 % of scientist characters in television pro - grams popular among middle school - age children in 2006 ( Long et al . , 2010 ) . Given this increased representation of female sci - entists , children might learn to associate science with both men and women . Exposure to female sci - entists might also weaken already - formed associa - tions of science with men ( Farland , 2006 ; Galdi , Cadinu , & Tomasetto , 2014 ; Gonzalez , Dunlop , & Baron , 2017 ) , especially if students identify with the female role models ( Young , Rudman , Buettner , & McLean , 2013 ) . Consistent with these hypotheses , women ’ s representation among science majors and employed researchers predicted weaker national gender - science stereotypes across 66 nations in one large study ( Miller et al . , 2015 ) . Hence , children ’ s stereotypes should partly re ﬂ ect changes in women ’ s representation in science over time . We therefore predicted that U . S . children would draw male scientists less often in later than earlier dec - ades . Our meta - analysis focused on U . S . samples to test this hypothesis because no other nation had enough relevant Draw - A - Scientist studies of chil - dren to allow examination of cultural change over several decades . The Present Meta - analysis In summary , our main hypotheses were that stereotypes linking science with men would strengthen with children ’ s age , but weaken over time in the United States . The wide array of Draw - 2 Miller , Nolla , Eagly , and Uttal A - Scientist studies , which include data dating back to the 1960s , allowed us to investigate classic ques - tions in developmental science about age and per - iod effects . This literature also provided a unique opportunity to compare studies on a common met - ric ( i . e . , percentage of male scientists ) because all studies administered the same task . In contrast , other meta - analyses typically include studies with many different measures that might not always be meaningful to compare in analyses . Several features of the Draw - A - Scientist Test should be noted from the outset ( see Finson , 2002 for a review ) . First , like other indirect measures of children ’ s attitudes and beliefs , the Draw - A - Scien - tist Test did not require children to consciously report their stereotypes with an introspective verbal response ( Cvencek & Meltzoff , 2015 ) . The indirect nature of this task can be advantageous in develop - mental research because children may ﬁ rst learn stereotypes implicitly before reporting them explic - itly ( Galdi et al . , 2014 ) . Second , as prior research suggests , children typi - cally draw more male than female scientists because they associate science with men and not because they generally draw males regardless of occupation . For instance , one study asked 206 ele - mentary school children to draw a scientist , a vet - erinarian , and a teacher ( Losh , Wilke , & Pop , 2008 ) . Among drawings in which sex could be deter - mined , 66 % of scientists were male , compared to 40 % of veterinarians and 25 % of teachers . In other words , children drew more males than females only for scientists , but not for the two other occupations in which women ’ s workforce representation was higher . These results suggest that these drawings at least in part re ﬂ ect children ’ s associations between sex and occupations . Finally , these drawings may also partly re ﬂ ect aspects of children ’ s own personal identities . For instance , tasks asking children to draw a generic person have often been interpreted as projective measures of children ’ s self - expression and gender identity ( Arteche , Bandeira , & Hutz , 2010 ) . Consis - tent with this hypothesis , when asked to draw a person , usually 70 % or more of both boys and girls have drawn their own sex in prior studies ( Arteche et al . , 2010 ; Picard , 2015 ) . Given these results , we predicted that boys in our meta - analysis would draw male scientists more often than girls . This mean difference between boys and girls , however , was not central to our main research goals . Instead , our analyses that considered children ’ s sex focused on investigating if change over age and historical time was present for both boys and girls . Method Literature Search and Inclusion Criteria We searched for the phrases “ draw a scientist ” OR “ draw - a - scientist ” in 15 databases of published literature ( e . g . , ERIC , PsycINFO , Web of Science ) ; see Table S1 for the list of databases . We also sys - tematically searched for unpublished studies using ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and Google Scholar . Google Scholar was especially helpful because it searches many sources such as university websites for unpublished studies ( see https : / / schola r . google . com / intl / en / scholar / inclusion . html ) . Pro - Quest yielded 317 dissertations and theses and , using the full text search option , Google Scholar yielded 1 , 890 results . We examined all articles that these 17 databases had indexed by the time we com - pleted our latest keyword searches in March 2017 . Using ﬁ ve citation databases ( Academic Search Complete , Google Scholar , PsycINFO , Scopus , and Web of Science ) , we also examined all articles that cited at least one of the following : ( a ) Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) landmark study , ( b ) a widely cited narrative review of Draw - A - Scientist studies ( Finson , 2002 ) , or ( c ) at least one of the other articles that ultimately became part of our sample . Search results were imported into EndNote X8 , and duplicates were deleted , yielding 3 , 042 unique references . From these references , we included studies that met all the following criteria : the study ( a ) reported a sample of U . S . K - 12 children , ( b ) asked these chil - dren to draw a scientist , ( c ) reported suf ﬁ cient information to record the number of male and female scientists drawn , and ( d ) had a sample size of at least 10 drawings . We aimed to study natural - istic change over historical time and therefore wanted to estimate children ’ s baseline stereotypes in the absence of study - speci ﬁ c educational or experimental interventions . Consequently , for pre - post and other longitudinal designs , studies were included only if they reported data separately for the ﬁ rst occasion in which children drew scientists . For posttest - only experimental or quasi - experimen - tal designs , studies were included only if they reported data separately for the control condition or found no signi ﬁ cant differences across conditions if data were reported aggregated across conditions . Applying these inclusion and exclusion criteria identi ﬁ ed 93 eligible articles ( see Appendix S1 for details on the process for determining eligibility and Appendix S2 for the list of articles ) . For a sample reported by multiple sources ( e . g . , in a dissertation and later journal article ) , we examined all articles for relevant information but created only one row of Children ’ s Gender - Science Stereotypes 3 data for that sample , yielding 79 independent sam - ples . Almost half of these studies ( 47 % ) were unpub - lished , indicating that our search methods were effective at ﬁ nding large amounts of relevant gray literature ( see Table S2 for the sources of unpub - lished and published studies ) . Appendix S3 details the coding system that we used to record modera - tors such as data collection year and average age . Meta - analytic Procedures Effect Size Calculations The main outcome variable was the percentage of male scientists among sex - identi ﬁ able drawings . When applicable , we recorded the percentage of all drawings depicting scientists of both sexes or inde - terminate sexes ( e . g . , the drawing only contained stick ﬁ gures with no sex cues such as long hair ) and included that percentage as a moderator in multivariable analyses . We converted percentages to log odds for statistical analysis . This conversion presented challenges for samples ( often boys ) that drew only male scientists because the logs odds would be in ﬁ nite . In those cases , we added 0 . 5 to both cells ( female and male counts ) , consistent with standard practice regarding continuity corrections for log odds ( Viechtbauer , 2010 ) . Statistical Models Our focal analyses used mixed - effects meta - regression models that assumed that observed variation in effect sizes was due to ﬁ xed effects of moderators ( e . g . , year of data collection ) , random effects of residual between - study heterogeneity , and within - study sampling variance ( Borenstein , Hedges , Higgins , & Rothstein , 2009 ) . Mixed - effects and ran - dom effects models were chosen over ﬁ xed effects models because we wanted to model heterogeneity of effect sizes and make inferences to a larger popu - lation of U . S . children ( Hedges & Vevea , 1998 ) . Between - study heterogeneity was quanti ﬁ ed by pre - senting 90 % credibility intervals ( a measure of the estimated dispersion of true underlying effects ) and I 2 statistics ( percentage of total variation in effect size due to heterogeneity rather than chance ) . These models were estimated with the metafor R package using restricted maximum likelihood estimation and the Knapp – Hartung adjustment to account for uncertainty in estimating heterogeneity ( Viechtbauer , 2010 ) . Although inferential statistical models ana - lyzed log odds , we converted model outputs back into more intuitive percentages when presenting descriptive statistics ( e . g . , regression trendlines ) . Publication Bias Our analyses tested for publication bias in sev - eral ways , including comparing average effects esti - mated by published versus unpublished studies and testing for asymmetry in the funnel plot of observed effect size plotted by sample size ( Boren - stein et al . , 2009 ) . We also tested for change over time in publication bias by including interaction terms with data collection year in relevant meta - regression models ( see Appendix S4 for details ) . In addition , we computed estimates of mean effect size and change over time adjusted for small - study effects ( e . g . , mean effect size differing as a function of sample size ) . Publication bias can be one source of small - study effects . Hence , adjusting for small - study effects using meta - regression models pro - vides one way to correct for publication bias ( Stan - ley & Doucouliagos , 2014 ; though see Simonsohn , 2017 for critique of this assumption ; see Appendix S4 for details ) . Outliers Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) original study was an outlier in terms of its data collection years ( 1966 – 1977 ) ; all other studies collected data in 1985 or after . That study was therefore unique in estimating children ’ s gender - science stereotypes during a period in which women ’ s representation in U . S . science was espe - cially low . However , Chambers ’ large effect size ( 99 . 4 % of drawings were male scientists ) and sample size ( N = 4 , 807 ) could have also disproportionately in ﬂ uenced regression analyses . We therefore repeated all analyses both including and excluding Chambers ’ study . Appendix S5 details how we iden - ti ﬁ ed outliers other than Chambers ( 1983 ) using vari - ous diagnostics ( e . g . , studentized deleted residuals ) developed for outlier detection in random effects and mixed - effects meta - regression models ( Viechtbauer & Cheung , 2010 ) . For reasons detailed in Appendix S5 , one outlier ( Cavallo , 2007 ) was excluded from all analyses and another outlier ( Flick , 1990 ) was excluded from analyses of boys ’ drawings . Results Our analyses addressed two main research ques - tions : ( a ) How do gender - science stereotypes vary across age and historical time ? ( b ) Do the predicted 4 Miller , Nolla , Eagly , and Uttal effects of age and time remain after accounting for each other and other moderators ? Of the 78 ana - lyzed studies , 30 studies reported data separately for boys and girls , and 11 studies included only girls . No study included only boys . We therefore conducted separate meta - analyses for all children ’ s drawings ( k = 78 studies ; N = 20 , 860 sex - identi ﬁ - able drawings ) , girls ’ drawings ( k = 41 ; N = 6 , 730 ) , and boys ’ drawings ( k = 29 ; N = 5 , 941 ) . The Sup - porting Information contain the data ﬁ les and R code needed to reproduce all analyses including ﬁ g - ures and tables . These materials have also been uploaded to the Open Science Framework ( https : / / osf . io / 3awvj / ) . All Drawings Distribution of Effect Sizes Children overall drew 73 % of scientists as male , 95 % CI [ 69 , 77 ] , averaged across all 78 analyzed samples using random effects weighting ; this per - centage was 72 % excluding Chambers ( 1983 ) . How - ever , effect sizes also varied widely across studies ( s 2 = 0 . 698 ; p < . 0001 ) . The middle 90 % of true underlying effects ( i . e . , 90 % credibility interval ) were estimated to fall within 41 % – 92 % . Further - more , most variability in observed effect sizes could be attributed to between - study heterogeneity rather than chance ( I 2 = 96 % ) , suggesting that moderators ( e . g . , age , year ) may help explain differences in observed effect sizes . Simple Regression Analysis Children drew male scientists less often in later than earlier decades ( see Figure 1a ) . Children drew 99 . 4 % of scientists as male in Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) study ( data collection years 1966 – 1977 ) compared to 72 % on average in later studies ( years 1985 – 2016 ) . The regression coef ﬁ cient for data collection year was signi ﬁ cant ( b = (cid:1) . 040 ; p = . 0004 ) . How - ever , when Chambers ’ study was excluded from analysis , the regression coef ﬁ cient was 51 % smaller in magnitude ( b = (cid:1) . 020 ) and the p value was . 062 ( see also the dashed line in Figure 1a ) . In other words , the clearest evidence of change over time came from analyses that used data from the 1960s and 1970s ( i . e . , Chambers ’ study ) . In addition , older children drew male scientists more often than younger children ( see Figure 1a ) , both when including Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) study ( b = . 098 ; p = . 023 ) or excluding it ( b = . 136 ; p < . 0001 ) . However , as also shown in Figure 1b , the age effect was smaller in magnitude when Chambers ’ study was included ( see solid line ) than excluded ( see dashed line ) because its large effect size was unexpected based on the young average age of children in it ( 8 . 26 years ) . Given Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) outlying data collection years ( 1966 – 1977 ) , we considered analyses excluding Chambers to be more appropriate estimates of average age effects in contemporary U . S . data . The mean percentage of male scientists did not signi ﬁ cantly differ from 50 % until age 8 when excluding Chambers and age 7 when including Chambers . Multivariable Regression Analysis Multivariable meta - regression models tested whether the predicted effects of average age and data collection year remained after controlling for each other and three other moderators : ( a ) percent - age of drawings with scientists of indeterminate sex ( see Effect Size Calculations in the Methods section for more details ) , ( b ) dummy code for publication status ( 0 = unpublished , 1 = published ) , and ( c ) dummy code for an all - female sample ( 0 = mixed - sex , 1 = all - female ) . This multivariable analysis helped address potential confounds between predic - tors ( see Table S3 for the correlation matrix ) . For instance , the regression coef ﬁ cient for age estimated comparisons between younger and older children , holding constant other moderators such as data col - lection year ( e . g . , 8 - year - olds in 2010 vs . 14 - year - olds in 2010 ) . When controlling for other moderators in multi - variable models , the age effect remained signi ﬁ cant both when Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) study was included ( b = . 084 ; p = . 024 ) or excluded ( b = . 119 ; p < . 0001 ) . In the same multivariable models , the historical time effect remained signi ﬁ cant when Chambers was included ( b = (cid:1) . 037 ; p = . 0004 ) , but not when excluded ( b = (cid:1) . 013 ; p = . 124 ) . Table 1 summarizes these age and time effects and Table S4 provides the complete multivariable models . Compared to a model with no moderators , between - study hetero - geneity was reduced from 0 . 698 to 0 . 463 in a multi - variable model including Chambers ( R 2 = 34 % ) and 0 . 392 to 0 . 226 in a multivariable model excluding Chambers ( R 2 = 42 % ) . One concern about cross - sectional age comparisons is the confound with birth cohort ( e . g . , 8 - year - olds in 2010 were born later in time than 14 - year - olds in 2010 ) . For instance , younger children might have drawn fewer male scientists than older children in the same data collection year because younger children were born and grew up later in Children ’ s Gender - Science Stereotypes 5 historical time . In other words , the estimated effect of age might not represent developmental change but instead a confound with birth cohort . However , this alternative explanation was unlikely because the magnitude of the age effect was much greater than the historical time effect ( see Table 1 to ●● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015 0 25 50 75 100 a P e r c en t M a l e S c i en t i s t s D r a w n Chambers ' ( 1983 ) Data 99 . 4 % ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 b Chambers ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015 0 25 50 75 100 c P e r c en t M a l e S c i en t i s t s D r a w n Chambers ' ( 1983 ) Data 98 . 8 % ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 d Chambers ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015 0 25 50 75 100 e P e r c en t M a l e S c i en t i s t s D r a w n Chambers ' ( 1983 ) Data Data Collection Year 100 % ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 f Average Age Chambers All Drawings ( k = 78 Samples , N = 20 , 860 ) Girls ' Drawings ( k = 41 Samples , N = 6 , 730 ) Boys ' Drawings ( k = 29 Samples , N = 5 , 941 ) Figure 1 .

The lines represent modelpredictions convertedfromlogoddstopercentagesbasedon includingChambers ’ ( 1983 ) study ( solidlines ) orexcludingit ( dashedlines ) . 6 Miller , Nolla , Eagly , and Uttal compare regression coef ﬁ cients ) . For instance , based on data from the 1980s and onwards ( i . e . , models excluding Chambers , 1983 ) , the mean percentage of male scientists changed from 54 % to 82 % between ages 6 and 16 ( 1 decade ) , but only changed from 74 % to 70 % between years 1995 and 2005 ( also 1 decade ) ; see Figure 1 . In other words , change over age happened more rapidly than what historical change would alone predict . These results were therefore consistent with rapid change over chil - dren ’ s development in addition to slower change over historical time . Sex - Speci ﬁ c Analyses We repeated analyses for girls ’ drawings ( k = 41 ) and boys ’ drawings ( k = 29 ) separately . Many stud - ies ( k = 37 ) included both girls and boys but did not report data on the drawn scientists ’ sex sepa - rately by children ’ s sex . Those 37 studies were excluded from the following analyses . In other words , sex - speci ﬁ c analyses used a subset of the full sample of 78 studies . Results could have dif - fered from the prior analyses in part for this reason ( e . g . , the historical time effect could have been stronger in the subset of studies that reported data separately for boys and girls ) . The exclusion of those 37 studies also meant the following analyses had reduced statistical power . Distribution of Effect Sizes Girls on average drew 58 % of scientists as male , 95 % CI [ 50 , 66 ] , but boys drew a much higher per - centage ( 96 % ) of scientists as male , 95 % CI [ 93 , 97 ] . These mean percentages were 55 % and 95 % , respec - tively , when excluding Chambers ( 1983 ) . Boys drew only male scientists in more than half of the sam - ples of boys ’ drawings ( 15 of 29 samples ) . Between - study heterogeneity was also large and signi ﬁ cant for both girls ( s 2 = 1 . 031 ; p < . 0001 ; I 2 = 96 % ; 90 % credibility interval [ 21 , 88 ] ) and boys ( s 2 = 1 . 027 ; p < . 0001 ; I 2 = 80 % ; 90 % credibility interval [ 80 , 99 ] ) . Historical Time and Age Effects Both girls and boys tended to draw male scien - tists less often in later than earlier decades ( see Fig - ure 1 ) . For instance , girls drew 98 . 8 % of scientists as male in Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) study compared to 55 % on average in later studies . The historical time effect was generally signi ﬁ cant in both simple and multivariable models for girls and boys ( see Table 1 ) . The exceptions to this rule were the multi - variable models excluding Chambers for girls ( p = . 051 ) and boys ( p = . 092 ) . The time effects were larger in magnitude when including Chambers ( see Table 1 ) . In addition , both girls and boys tended to draw male scientists more often with increasing age . This age effect was signi ﬁ cant in all regression models for girls and boys when Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) study was excluded from analysis ( p s < . 034 ) . However , when Chambers was included , the age effect was smaller in magnitude and generally not signi ﬁ cant ( see Table 1 ) . As discussed earlier , we considered analyses based on data from the 1980s and onwards ( i . e . , models excluding Chambers ) to pro - vide more appropriate estimates of average age effects in contemporary U .

For instance , based on a simple meta - regression model excluding Cham - bers , girls on average drew 30 % of scientists as male at age 6 ( early elementary school ; see Fig - ure 1d ) . However , girls switched to drawing more Table 1 Meta - Regressions Estimates of Historical Time and Age Effects Predictor Including Chambers Excluding Chambers b p b p Data collection year Full sample ( simple ) (cid:1) . 040 < . 001 (cid:1) . 020 . 062 Full sample ( multivariable ) (cid:1) . 037 < . 001 (cid:1) . 013 . 124 Girls only ( simple ) (cid:1) . 063 < . 001 (cid:1) . 034 . 028 Girls only ( multivariable ) (cid:1) . 059 < . 001 (cid:1) . 024 . 051 Boys only ( simple ) (cid:1) . 084 . 003 (cid:1) . 058 . 035 Boys only ( multivariable ) (cid:1) . 081 . 004 (cid:1) . 044 . 092 Average age Full sample ( simple ) . 098 . 023 . 136 < . 001 Full sample ( multivariable ) . 084 . 024 . 119 < . 001 Girls only ( simple ) . 127 . 065 . 195 < . 001 Girls only ( multivariable ) . 125 . 032 . 187 < . 001 Boys only ( simple ) . 193 . 067 . 252 . 003 Boys only ( multivariable ) . 107 . 246 . 182 . 034 Note . The left and right columns display regression coef ﬁ cients from models including and excluding Chambers ( 1983 ) landmark study , respectively . Simple regression models included only one predictor ( i . e . , data collection year or average age ) , but multivariable models controlled for data collection year , average age , and other predictors simultaneously ( see Table S4 for the complete multivariable models ) . The unstandardized regression coef ﬁ cients ( b s ) are the predicted change in log odds of drawing male scientists per unit increase in the predictor variable . The unit for age and data collection year was the same ( i . e . , 1 year ) , meaning that their coef ﬁ cients can be directly com - pared to contrast the magnitude of age and historical time effects . Children ’ s Gender - Science Stereotypes 7 male than female scientists between the ages of 10 and 11 ( ﬁ fth grade ; end of elementary school ) . By age 16 ( high school ) , girls on average drew 75 % of scientists as male . In contrast , for boys , the mean percentage of male scientists changed from 83 % to 98 % between ages 6 and 16 , excluding Chambers ( see Figure 1f ) . The magnitude of historical time and age effects did not signi ﬁ cantly differ by chil - dren ’ s sex ( see Appendix S6 ) . Supplemental Analyses The Supporting Information details the results for supplemental analyses including those regard - ing publication bias ( see Appendix S4 ) , the within - study effect of age ( Appendix S7 ) , and outcomes other than scientists ’ sex such as the presence of laboratory coats ( Appendix S8 ) . We brie ﬂ y summa - rize the results of these supplemental analyses here . Publication Bias Funnel plot analyses provided no evidence of publication bias or change over time in publication bias ( p s > . 26 ; see Figure S1 for the funnel plot ) . Published and unpublished studies also did not sig - ni ﬁ cantly differ in mean effect size ( p s > . 50 ) , but the difference between published and unpublished stud - ies changed over time ( see Appendix S4 for details ) . The evidence for change over time in publication bias was therefore inconsistent because the difference between published and unpublished studies changed over time , but funnel plot asymmetry did not . In addition , we computed estimates of mean effect size and change over time adjusted for small - study effects using meta - regression models that extrapolated to a hypothetical set of studies with in ﬁ nite sample size ( see Appendix S4 for details ) . The adjusted historical time effect was signi ﬁ cant when including Chambers ’ ( 1983 ) study ( b = (cid:1) . 049 ; p = . 0008 ) , but not when excluding it ( b = (cid:1) . 016 ; p = . 273 ) ; see Table S5 . These results reinforce the earlier conclusion that the evidence for change over time was robust when including Chambers but ten - tative when excluding Chambers . Within - Study Effect of Age Thirteen studies reported data disaggregated by age cohort , allowing us to estimate age effects based on within - study comparisons ( i . e . , younger vs . older children within the same study ) . Using hierarchical dependence models ( see Appendix S7 for details ) , we found that that older children drew male scientists more often than younger children , even among children within the same study , demonstrating the robustness of age effects for this literature . Other Outcomes Analyses examining outcomes other than the sci - entist ’ s sex ( e . g . , presence of laboratory coats ) found that older children more often than younger chil - dren drew scientists with laboratory coats ( b = . 195 ; p = . 008 ) and eyeglasses ( b = . 185 ; p = . 0002 ) . In addition , children in later decades also drew scenes that were indoors or in a laboratory less often than children in earlier decades ( see Appendix S8 or Fig - ure S2 for more details ) . Based on random effects weighting , 50 % of drawn scientists had laboratory coats , 38 % had eyeglasses or goggles , 78 % were indoors or in a laboratory , 18 % were middle - aged or older , and 79 % were Caucasian on average . Discussion This meta - analysis provides the ﬁ rst systematic , quantitative review of studies that have adminis - tered the Draw - A - Scientist Test . By combining 78 studies including over 20 , 000 children , we found changes in children ’ s gender - science stereotypes , as re ﬂ ected in their drawings of scientists . Consistent with our main hypotheses , the tendency to draw male scientists increased with children ’ s age but decreased over historical time in the United States . In addition , boys drew male scientists more often than girls . These ﬁ ndings provide insight into how children learn to associate science with men and how children respond to changes in their cultural environment such as increases in women ’ s repre - sentation in science . Change Over Children ’ s Age Results suggested children did not associate science with men until grade school . When children started kindergarten at ages 5 – 6 , they drew roughly equal percentages of male and female scientists , averaged across boys and girls . Children did not draw signi ﬁ cantly more male than female scientists until ages 7 – 8 . In contrast , some stereotypes such as those about gender and household chores ﬁ rst emerge much earlier in development including as early as ages 2 – 3 ( Martin & Ruble , 2010 ) . Children 8 Miller , Nolla , Eagly , and Uttal may gain knowledge of some occupations such as babysitter and ﬁ re ﬁ ghter even in preschool . How - ever , consistent with our ﬁ ndings , children ’ s knowl - edge of scientists likely develops later as they encounter science in school and in the media . During elementary and middle school , the ten - dency to draw male scientists increased rapidly with age . When children started high school at ages 14 – 15 , they drew more male than female scientists by an average ratio of four to one . The tendency to draw scientists with laboratory coats and eyeglasses also increased with age , suggesting that children learn multiple stereotypes about scientists as children mature ( Finson , Beaver , & Cramond , 1995 ) . These age - related increases are consistent with children gaining more exposure throughout devel - opment to male scientists dressed in archetypal laboratory attire . Change Over Time The strongest evidence for change over time came from analyses that included data from the 1960s and 1970s ( i . e . , Chambers , 1983 ) . Less than 1 % of children drew a female scientist in Chambers ’ landmark study ( data collection years 1966 – 1977 ) , but that percentage rose to 28 % on average in later studies ( data collec - tion years 1985 – 2016 ) . The historical time effect was robust in all regression models including Chambers ’ study ( p s < . 005 in all six models ) . Even within stud - ies conducted after Chambers ’ , children tended to draw female scientists more often over time , but this trend was less clear ( e . g . , the p value was . 062 in the simple regression model including all studies except Chambers ) . In other words , U . S . children have drawn more female scientists since the 1960s and 1970s , but the evidence for change within later dec - ades is tentative . These ﬁ ndings suggest that children ’ s stereotypes associating science with men have weakened over time in the United States , consistent with increases in women ’ s representation in science . However , women also remain underrepresented in several science ﬁ elds . For instance , in 2013 , women were 49 % of biological scientists , 35 % of chemists , and 11 % of physicists and astronomers in the United States ( National Science Board , 2016 , appendix table 3 – 12 ) . Children may glean information about these numerical imbalances through multiple sources such as textbooks , classroom and extracurricular experi - ences , and extensive media content . Consistent with this hypothesis , children in recent years still drew more male than female scientists on average . Differences by Children ’ s Sex Both boys ’ and girls ’ drawings showed age - related and historical time - related changes in the predicted directions , con ﬁ rming our main hypothe - ses separately for boys and girls . In addition , boys drew male scientists much more often than girls . This sex difference is consistent with these draw - ings partly re ﬂ ecting children ’ s own gender identi - ties and in - group preferences . Most children have positive attitudes toward their own sex ( Dunham , Baron , & Banaji , 2015 ; Halim , Ruble , Tamis - LeM - onda , Shrout , & Amodio , 2017 ) and therefore may draw their own sex as an expression of these atti - tudes . For instance , when asked to draw a generic person , usually 70 % or more of both boys and girls draw their own sex ( Arteche et al . , 2010 ; Picard , 2015 ) . Our meta - analysis found similar results for the youngest children included in Draw - A - Scientist studies . For instance , based on data from the 1980s and onwards ( i . e . , models excluding Chambers , 1983 ) , 70 % of girls and 83 % of boys on average drew their own sex at age 6 . Children at this age may have defaulted to draw - ing their own sex because they had limited knowl - edge of scientists ( Lee , 2010 ; Newton & Newton , 1992 ) . As children grew older , both girls and boys drew male scientists more often , likely re ﬂ ecting their increased gender - science stereotypes . For data from the 1980s and onwards ( i . e . , models excluding Chambers , 1983 ) , girls switched to drawing more male than female scientists between the ages 10 and 11 , roughly corresponding to the end of elementary school . By age 16 , girls drew more male than female scientists by an average ratio of three to one . The age - related change for boys was less apparent in graphs of mean percentages ( e . g . , Figure 1f ) because boys started at a much higher mean per - centage of male scientists ( e . g . , 83 % at age 6 ) . Like - wise , although both boys and girls drew female scientists more often over time , this historical time - related change might appear to some readers to be less dramatic for boys than girls . For instance , between the years 1985 and 2016 , the mean percent - age of female scientists rose from 33 % to 58 % for girls ( 25 % points ) and 2 . 4 % to 13 % for boys ( 10 % points ) , based on data excluding Chambers . How - ever , differences in baseline rates must be taken in account when interpreting these changes . For instance , viewed another way , boys ’ likelihood of drawing female scientists rose by over 400 % between the years 1985 and 2016 , which could be considered Children ’ s Gender - Science Stereotypes 9 a large change . Hence , interpretation of whether changes were larger for girls versus boys is partly a matter of perspective . In fact , the age - related and his - torical time - related changes tended to be stronger in magnitude for boys than girls on a log odds scale , but these differences were not statistically signi ﬁ cant . Most importantly , our main hypotheses about age - related and historical time - related change were con - ﬁ rmed separately for girls and boys . Methodological Contributions In addition to providing insight on the develop - ment of children ’ s gender - science stereotypes , our research illustrates how developmental scientists can use meta - analytic methods to study age and histori - cal period effects . These effects are often dif ﬁ cult to study in tandem because age - related differences in studies can stem from maturational processes or changes in the sociocultural context in which chil - dren are reared and observed . The traditional approach to addressing this issue is to collect longitu - dinal data , but this approach is limited when study - ing cultural change because longitudinal studies often include only one cohort of children . In contrast , meta - analyses are well suited to simultaneously investigate developmental and cultural change if the relevant studies include children of varying ages and span several decades of data collection . Meta - analysts adopting this approach , however , should still be cautious by considering potential confounds . For instance , our approach for studying developmental change focused on cross - sectional age comparisons ( e . g . , 8 - year - olds in 2010 vs . 14 - year - olds in 2010 ) . These cross - sectional compar - isons controlled for data collection year , but not birth cohort ( e . g . , 8 - year - olds in 2010 were born later in time than 14 - year - olds in 2010 ) . Comparing the estimated magnitudes of age and period effects can help evaluate the potential impact of such con - founds . For instance , in our meta - analysis , change over children ’ s age was much more rapid than change over data collection year , suggesting that historical differences in children ’ s rearing cannot alone account for the large age effect . In other words , these results suggested genuine change over children ’ s development in addition to slower change over historical time . Limitations Several limitations of our research should be noted . First , our meta - analysis included only one measure of children ’ s stereotypes of scientists ( i . e . , the Draw - A - Scientist Test ) . Although multiple stereo - type measures could have provided additional insight , analyzing a single measure also enabled us to cleanly compare studies on a simple common metric ( i . e . , percentage of male scientists ) . Including multiple measures could have presented additional interpretational challenges because different tasks may measure different constructs ( for an example of these interpretational issues , see Signorella , Bigler , & Liben , 1993 ) . Second , our meta - analysis included only studies from the United States . Our literature search found some studies from other nations , but only U . S . research provided enough relevant studies of children to study change over several decades of data collection . Investigating differences across nations was therefore beyond the scope of this meta - analysis . Third , most studies were convenience sam - ples , not nationally representative samples . For instance , several researchers were teachers who assessed students in their own classrooms ( e . g . , Bohrmann & Akerson , 2001 ) . Differences in local sample populations could have added extraneous between - study heterogeneity , making differences across other study features ( e . g . , data collection year ) more dif ﬁ cult to observe . However , in defense of our ﬁ ndings , age - related and historical time - related differences were still found despite this additional heterogeneity . Conclusion and Implications In summary , the Draw - A - Scientist literature pro - vided a valuable opportunity to study developmen - tal and cultural change in the same meta - analysis and compare studies on a simple common metric assessing children ’ s associations of science with men . Our meta - analysis is the ﬁ rst systematic , quantitative review of this extensive literature span - ning 5 decades of data collection . Based on 78 stud - ies with over 20 , 000 children , U . S . children ’ s drawings of scientists depicted female scientists more often in later decades but less often among older children . These results suggest both age - related and historical time - related changes in chil - dren ’ s gender - science stereotypes . The time - related change was consistent with increases in women ’ s representation in U . S . science . However , even in recent years , children may still learn to associate science with men because women remain underrep - resented in some science ﬁ elds . Consistent with this hypothesis , children in recent samples still drew more male than female scientists on average . Stereotypes linking science with men might limit girls ’ interests in science - related activities and careers , 10 Miller , Nolla , Eagly , and Uttal as some theories of gender development would pre - dict ( e . g . , Hyde , 2014 ; Martin & Ruble , 2010 ) . For instance , girls may avoid activities that they consider appropriate for boys but not girls , as some correla - tional and experimental studies have suggested ( e . g . , Bian , Leslie , & Cimpian , 2017 ; Weisgram , 2016 ) . Girls might also underperform on evaluative tests in male - stereotyped domains such as mathematics and science ( Galdi et al . , 2014 ; but see also Flore & Wicherts , 2015 , for evidence of publication bias in this stereotype threat literature ) . Furthermore , chil - dren may learn other related traits of scientists that also limit girls ’ science - related aspirations . For instance , scientists are often seen as agentic ( e . g . , competitive , independent ) but not communal ( e . g . , helpful , sociable ) , which con ﬂ icts with traits people usually associate with women ( Carli , Alawa , Lee , Zhao , & Kim , 2016 ) . This cultural mismatch between traits associated with scientists and women might also dampen girls ’ interest in science careers ( Diek - man , Steinberg , Brown , Belanger , & Clark , 2017 ) . Children ’ s stereotypes of scientists could there - fore partly shape sex differences in science - related interests ( Gunderson et al . , 2012 ; Hyde , 2014 ) . Girls in recent years may now develop these interests more freely because these stereotypes of scientists have become more androgynous over time . Never - theless , women remain underrepresented in several science ﬁ elds , and information about such imbal - ances is ﬁ ltered through multiple sources such as mass media and social interactions . Children ’ s drawings of scientists provide one fruitful way to study how children integrate information from these sources to form stereotypes about scientists .
