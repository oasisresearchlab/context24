With the lifting of COVID‑19 restrictions in the country and a focus on vaccination , this research aims to shed light on the potential for virus transmission in various settings . Air sampling was con‑ ducted in healthcare and non‑healthcare facilities , covering locations frequented by individuals across different age groups . The study found that out of 31 air samples , only four showed the presence of SARS‑CoV‑2 RNA by RT‑qPCR , with no viable virus detected after RNAse pre‑treatment . These positive samples were primarily associated with envi‑ ronments involving children and the elderly . Notably , sequencing revealed mutations associated with increased infectivity in one of the samples . The results highlight the importance of considering children as potential sources of virus transmission , especially in settings with prolonged indoor exposure . As vaccination coverage increases glob‑ ally , and with children still representing a substantial unvaccinated population , the study emphasizes the need to re‑ implement mask‑wearing mandates indoors and in public transport to reduce virus transmission . The findings have implications for public health strategies to control COVID‑19 , particularly in the face of new variants and the potential for increased transmission during the autumn and winter seasons .

Virology Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 275 Introduction Almost three years have passed since the COVID - 19 pandemic started in December 2019 [ 1 ] . During this time , much has been debated about the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , and how each transmission mode con - tributed to the worldwide spread of the virus , as well as all the factors involved in different transmission set - tings [ 2 – 4 ] . Now , it is well established that transmission through surfaces did not account for a great proportion of the infections , and that transmission occurs mainly through close contact , respiratory droplets and aerosols [ 5 , 6 ] , with indoor airborne transmission likely being the main driver of the pandemic [ 7 – 10 ] . Strict vaccination , surveillance and control policies helped to control viral spread , however , there is still a major gap in knowledge when it comes to airborne transmission , namely : how different environmental and meteorological parameters affect virus infectivity in the environment ; how long the virus survives in the air ; and more importantly , what is the minimum infec - tious dose of the virus . This information is essential for understanding airborne transmission dynamics and how we can prevent infection more efficiently [ 10 – 12 ] . There are several inherent difficulties in studying air - borne SARS - CoV - 2 , e . g . the low virus concentration in air compared to clinical samples from the nasophar - ynx [ 13 ] ; the variation of air - sampling techniques used , making generalization and interpretation of results dif - ficult [ 14 ] ; the lack of BSL - 3 facilities for assessment of viral viability in air in most of the studies [ 15 , 16 ] , among others . Although a high vaccination coverage was reached in most of Europe and America by the first trimester of 2022 [ 17 ] , still new waves with record - high number of cases have been reported in that year , with the surge of a more transmissible variant of concern named Omi - cron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) and its sub - lineages BA . 4 and BA . 5 31 [ 18 ] . Since distinct vaccine booster strategies are in place across the world that cover different age groups and indi - viduals with different risk profiles , information regarding viral presence in air can provide a more in - depth charac - terization of the risk for COVID - 19 infection . In Norway , in early 2022 , 86 % of individuals above 16 years of age were vaccinated with two doses , and 86 % of people ≥ 65 years old had received a booster dose [ 19 ] . No COVID - 19 restrictions were in place other than the use of mask in healthcare facilities . As of 9th January 2022 in Norway , 72 % of the entire population have been fully vaccinated . 86 % of the people in the age group 16 years - old or older , and 88 % of the people in the age group 18 years - old or older were fully vaccinated . Moreover , 82 % of the people in the 16 – 17 years - old age group and 52 % of people in the 12 – 15 years - old age group had been vaccinated with one dose , and 35 % of people in the 16 – 17 years - old age group had been fully vaccinated [ 19 ] . With that in mind , we have performed air sampling in two cities in Norway in April and May 2022 in order to assess SARS - CoV - 2 presence in different indoor and outdoor environments . Healthcare and non - healthcare related facilities were included , covering locations fre - quented by people of all age groups . Considering the complete lift of all restrictions in the country during that period , and the fact that the country had a low number of new daily infections , these results can be used as indica - tor of potential virus spread rates and the level of trans - mission risk in the country during that period . Materials and methods Air sampling Air sampling ( n = 31 ) was performed in the period of two weeks , between April and May 2022 , in indoor and outdoor areas of two cities of Norway , Ås and Oslo , in healthcare and non - healthcare facilities , at periods of the day with increased movement of people . Air samples were collected using the Coriolis ® Com - pact ( Bertin Instruments , Montigny - le - Bretonneux , France ) air sampler with an airflow rate of 50 L / min . The duration of sampling was set according to the type of environment and permissions obtained for sampling , with slightly shorter sampling duration indoors where a high number of people was present . The minimum dis - tance between the air sampling device and potential emission sources was 0 . 5 m in all sampling locations . The maximum distance varied depending on the size of the location and whether it was an open space or not , with distances of over 3 m between the air sampler and poten - tial emission sources in open spaces such as the public parks and squares . Details about air sampling locations and settings are summarized in Table 1 . The sampler was placed at a height of approximately 1 m at all sampling sites . Air samples were collected on a dry medium , with 1 . 5 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) added to the collection cones after sampling . All samples were stored at 4 °C and transported to the laboratory within 4 h , where they were stored at – 80 °C until further processing . RNA extraction and RT‑qPCR RNA extraction was performed using the GRS Viral DNA / RNA Purification Kit ( GRISP , Porto , Portugal ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 200 µL of sample suspension , resulting in 50 µL of RNA elu - ate after extraction as previously described [ 20 ] . Two RT - qPCR reactions targeting N1 and N2 were used ( Xpert qDetect COVID - 19 , GRISP , Porto , Portugal ) . The CFX Real - Time PCR ( qPCR ) Detection System Page 3 of 8 da Silva et al . Virology Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 275 ( Bio - Rad , USA ) with the Bio - Rad CFX Maestro 1 . 0 Software version 4 . 0 . 2325 . 0418 was used for data analy - sis . For each reaction , 4 µL of RNA was used , with every run including ssDNA N1 and N2 targets ( positive con - trols ) and a no - template control . Reactions were run for 15 min at 45 °C and 2 min at 95 °C , then 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s , and 55 °C for 30 s . All samples were run in duplicates . A standard curve was generated using ssDNA targets for both N1 and N2 in a 10 - fold serial dilution start - ing at 200 , 000 copies / µL , in order to quantify viral gene copies based on sample Ct values . The limit of detec - tion ( LOD ) was 1 . 3 and 3 . 2 copies / µL for N1 and N2 , respectively . Air sampling results are expressed in gene copies / m 3 . Viral viability The viral viability was evaluated with a nuclease sam - ple treatment prior to RNA extraction using a previ - ously described method with minor modifications [ 21 ] . The RNAse pre - treatment assumes that viable viruses with intact capsids and envelopes will not have their genetic material degraded by RNAse and amplifica - tion during the RT - qPCR would indicate viable viruses [ 22 ] . Prior to RNA extraction , three aliquots of the air sample were pre - treated with 8 µL of RNAse A ( GRISP , Porto , Portugal ) with the following concentrations : 1 µg / µL , 10 µg / µL and 50 µg / µL , at 37 °C for 30 min . An untreated aliquot of each sample was also tested for comparison of RT - qPCR results between treated and non - treated samples .

Virology Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 275 Sequencing Positive RT - qPCR samples were confirmed by hemin - ested RT - PCR targeting a 398 - bp fragment of the SARS - CoV - 2 N gene [ 23 ] . Amplicons of expected sizes in the gel were purified with GRS PCR Purification Kit ( Grisp , Porto , Portugal ) and , bidirectional Sanger sequencing was performed with the specific primers of the target gene . Sequences were aligned with BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor v7 . 1 . 9 software package , version 2 . 1 ( Ibis Biosciences , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and compared with the sequences available in the NCBI ( GenBank , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) nucleotide database ( http : / / blast . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / Blast , accessed on 9th November 2022 ) . Results Out of 31 samples , four were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA by RT - qPCR when pre - treatment with RNAse was not performed . These samples were : sample 21 ( kinder - garten , indoor eating room ) [ 6 gene copies / m 3 ] , sample 22 ( kindergarten , outdoor playground ) [ 6 gene copies / m 3 ] , sample 27 ( nursing home , indoor cafeteria ) [ 6 gene copies / m 3 ] and sample 28 ( Health clinic , pediatrics waiting room ) [ 5 gene copies / m 3 ] . Pre - treatment with the three RNAse concentrations followed by RT - qPCR showed that all the previously positive samples were negative . Heminested RT - PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing allowed to retrieve one sequence . This sequence was obtained from sample 21 ( GenBank acces - sion number OQ296419 ) . BLAST analysis showed 100 % identity with a SARS - CoV - 2 isolate from a human from Tokyo , Japan ( OQ326844 ) . Genomic sequence analysis identified two mutations in relation to the SARS - CoV - 2 strain first detected in Wuhan in ( NC _ 045512 . 2 ) , both in the nucleocapsid ( R203K and G204R ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Discussion With all COVID - 19 restrictions being lifted in Norway , and no obligation for mask use , not even in healthcare facilities , the present study aimed to assess the pres - ence of SARS - CoV - 2 in air samples from various indoor and outdoor spaces , including both healthcare and non - healthcare related facilities . We found that , out of 31 air samples , only four showed the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA by RT - qPCR , with no amplification after RNAse pre - treatment , strongly suggesting that no viable virus was present in these four samples . The four positive samples came from a kindergarten ( n = 2 ) , a nursing home ( n = 1 ) and from the pediatrics waiting room in a health clinic ( n = 1 ) . It should be noted that on the day of the sampling in the kindergarten , most of the children were showing respiratory disease symp - toms but none was using facemasks . Moreover , at the nursing home one of the nurses’ staff had tested positive for COVID - 19 the previous day . It is important to mention that the number of people present in each sampled location varied throughout sam - pling duration in every location , as sampled locations were either outdoor public spaces with a constant and heavy influx of people such as public parks or the train station , or indoor spaces with constant but not so heavy movement of people such as the health clinic , where patients would come and go constantly . Nonetheless , in the locations where SARS - CoV - 2 RNA could be recov - ered from the air samples , the density of people present Fig . 1 Alignment and genome annotations for the sequenced sample with the SARS‑CoV‑2 isolate Wuhan‑Hu‑1 ( NC _ 045512 . 2 ) highlighting the R203K and G204R mutations . Modified from Coronavirus Typing Tool , Version 1 . 25 Page 5 of 8 da Silva et al . Virology Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 275 was low ( that is , less than 15 people present at the loca - tions during sampling ) . When looking at these results , although they indicate that non - infectious viruses were present in air samples , we cannot exclude the possibility that the collection pro - cess might have contributed to the inactivation of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 24 ] . Multiple factors can potentially contribute to the decline in virus viability , including the collection pro - cess and prolonged airborne state ( which increases the likelihood of surface damage due to impaction , exposure to harmful airborne contaminants , desiccation , or degra - dation ) [ 25 ] . In the case of the Coriolis Compact , which is a cyclone sampler , a film of liquid is injected close to the cyclone’s inlet to wet the cyclone walls , which are subse - quently collected at the cyclone’s base for analysis . This is thought to increase viability of collected viral or other microorganism particles that are being sampled , however shear forces may still decrease particles ‘viability [ 26 – 28 ] . As the probability of detecting infectious SARS - CoV - 2 is directly correlated with the amount of viral RNA detected by RT - qPCR , and infectious viruses are more likely to be detected when viral RNA is present in concentrations greater than 1 × 10 6 gene copies / mL [ 29 ] , viable viruses were not expected to be present in our study based on the low numbers of gene copies / m 3 found . This is in keeping with previous studies on SARS - CoV - 2 that identified viable virus in air samples [ 30 – 32 ] , with 1000 gene copies / m 3 [ 31 ] . Of note , in another study it was estimated that an RNA concentration of 2 . 5 × 10 5 RNA copies / mL had less than a 5 % success rate for iso - lating infectious virus [ 33 ] . Within this < 5 % success rate of isolating infectious virus , another study reported a limit of 4 . 3 × 10 6 RNA copies / mL [ 34 ] . All these values are in accordance with other studies which have shown that samples with Ct values > 24 are unlikely to be virus positive after cultured [ 35 ] . However , it is important to emphasize that Ct measurements depend on the RT - qPCR assay and platform used [ 36 ] . Information about viability of SARS - CoV - 2 viruses in air samples is very important when discussing risk assessment , as risk assessment studies are used by poli - cymakers and health agencies to develop mitigation and preventative strategies to control viral transmission in the community , as well as its applications in occupational health [ 37 ] . In this context , the nuclease pre - treatment method offers an alternative to estimate the presence of infectious viruses in air samples when viral culture is not possible , allowing for a better interpretation of studies on SARS - CoV - 2 presence in ar . Moreover , this method has the potential to enhance analyses aimed at support - ing risk - based investigations , whether for preventing new outbreaks or managing recurrent ones , and can be applied across a wide range of scenarios [ 38 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 typically causes mild illness and few deaths in children and adolescents when compared to adults [ 39 ] . However , these groups still remain suscepti - ble to SARS - CoV - 2 infection and may transmit the virus to other people , such as the elderly parcel of the popula - tion , which increases the burden of the disease on pub - lic health systems ( World Health Organization ( WHO ) [ 40 ] ) . Interestingly , our results point to a link between SARS - CoV - 2 presence in air in environments with more children under the age of three present , which , until this day , still makes up the age - group worldwide with more unvaccinated people against COVID - 19 [ 41 , 42 ] . Nonetheless , the sequenced sampled presented the nucleocapsid mutations R203K ( 28881G > A , 28882G > A ) and G204R ( 28883G > C ) that have been reported to increase the infectivity , fitness , and virulence of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 43 ] , being associated with increased infectivity of SARS - CoV - 2 strains in the United States ( USA ) , as well as being predominant in both the USA and Europe [ 44 ] . The mutation G204R is non - conservative , and the R203K mutation has been pointed to function as a non - conserv - ative substitution due to the different size of the arginine ( R ) versus lysine ( K ) residues and the considerably dif - ferent chemical features of the side - chain guanidinium group ( arginine ) versus the primary amine ( lysine ) . It has been hypothesized that these mutations may influence disease severity by altering linker region flexibility and dynamics , which would in turn alter nucleocapsid func - tion [ 45 ] . One of the significant unanswered questions about the COVID - 19 epidemiology is related to the role of chil - dren in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 46 ] , which is a group that comprises a significant share of the popu - lation in many countries ( Charumilind et al . [ 47 ] ) . With milder symptoms , children are tested less often and cases may go unreported ( World Health Organization ( WHO ) [ 40 ] ) , allowing the virus to reach more susceptible groups such as the elderly and immune - compromised . Recent reports have also suggested that the Omicron variant and its sub - lineages may lead to more frequent hospi - talization in children , as children make up a larger part of patients hospitalized with COVID - 19 than in previ - ous infection waves caused by other variants of concern [ 41 ] . Moreover , when considering that SARS - CoV - 2 RNA could be detected in a nursing home facility , it puts into question the prevention guidelines in place at the time , when it comes to the safety of the elderly population , as previous epidemiological data from Norway show that the majority of COVID - 19 related deaths are among this risk group [ 48 ] . However , evidence to date still suggests that children are not among the main drivers of the pandemic [ 49 ] . That added to the fact that asymptomatic children have Page 6 of 8 da Silva et al . Virology Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 275 significantly lower viral loads compared to children with symptomatic infections [ 50 ] have resulted in less effort trying to understand the role of children in the airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 51 ] . In another study , it was highlighted that although esti - mates of children’s susceptibility and infectivity are lower than those of adults within a household , it is important to remember that their role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 is also affected by different contact patterns and hygiene habits outside the household ( Dattner et al . [ 46 ] ) . More intense contact and mixing among children compared to adults in schools , e . g . , could offset the effect of reduced susceptibility . In a review it is brought to attention the fact that roughly half of the United States population goes to school , works in a school , or is a first - degree contact of individuals that frequent these environments , suggest - ing that in - school transmission can impact the disease burden in surrounding communities [ 52 ] . This raises the alarm for the higher probability of virus spreading in school settings , as they have one of the main elements for a superspreading event , which is prolonged indoor expo - sure to other people . Whether these schools have appro - priate ventilation or not is another factor that should be taken into consideration when evaluating exposure risk in school settings . Another important factor concern - ing children and increased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection is that households with children in low income , urban communities have an extremely high household second - ary attack rate , with children playing important roles as index cases [ 51 ] . This study sheds light on the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in indoor and outdoor environments , particularly focus - ing on healthcare and non - healthcare settings . With lifted COVID - 19 restrictions and a significant percentage of the population vaccinated , our findings provide valu - able insights into the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sion at a time where all restrictions have been lifted and vaccination coverage is high . Our air sampling in Norway took place in two cit - ies , namely Oslo and Ås , in the end of April and begin - ning of May 2022 . During this period , there had been a steady decline in the number of new patients admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID - 19 , with the num - ber of new patients admitted per 100 . 000 people being highest in the age groups 75 – 84 and ≥ 85 years [ 19 ] . Of note , during this period , 58 % of people who deceased due to COVID - 19 complications died in a health institution other than a hospital , primarily in nursing homes . The Omicron variant BA . 2 was the dominant sub - lineage in the country , accounting for 95 – 100 % of all whole - genome sequenced samples during that period [ 19 ] . Considering that our sampling campaign took place at a moment of low - transmission in Norway , and that sampling covered various indoor and outdoor environ - ments ( public parks , public transport stations , university restaurants , a nursing home , a kindergarten , and a health clinic ) , the fact that SARS - CoV - 2 RNA could be detected only in environments related to children and the elderly raises some issues when it comes to mitigation guidelines and prevention strategies . First of all , as vaccination coverage is increasing around the world and we have started to normalize life towards the pre - COVID - 19 time , COVID - 19 cases are escalat - ing and SARS - CoV - 2 surveillance is reduced , painting out a coming challenging winter in Europe [ 53 ] . That being said , it is urgent that countries in the EU region relaunch mitigation efforts and are ready to respond to an increased burden on their health - care systems . The application of what the WHO calls “Five Pan - demic Stabilizers” ( increased vaccination rates , a sec - ond booster dose to immunocompromised people and their close contacts , mask wearing indoors and in public transports , improving ventilation in crowded and pub - lic spaces , and applying rigorous therapeutic protocols for those at risk of severe disease ) will be of the utmost importance in order to control virus transmission during autumn and winter [ 53 ] . When considering that children still represent the majority of the unvaccinated people not only in the EU region but in a global scale , and the fact that this group is often asymptomatic and less frequently tested , special attention should be given to the importance of re - imple - menting mask wearing indoors and in public transports , as this is still one of the most efficient interventions against SARS - CoV - 2 airborne transmission [ 54 , 55 ] . This would reduce transmission of the virus to children , which in turn would help prevent the virus spread from this group to at - risk groups such as the elderly and immu - nocompromised . Furthermore , considering the surge of Omicron and its sub - lineages that are more easily trans - missible , reinstating mask mandates might be the best strategy to control community transmission of COVID - 19 [ 55 ] . Conclusion This study detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air samples from specific locations , such as a kindergarten , a nurs - ing home , and a pediatrics waiting room in a health clinic . Importantly , the RNAse pre - treatment indicated that the virus in these samples was likely non - infec - tious , suggesting that the collection process may have contributed to the inactivation of the virus . Despite this , genetic sequencing revealed mutations associated with increased infectivity and virulence , raising con - cerns about the potential risks associated with infec - tion . One notable aspect highlighted by this study is Page 7 of 8 da Silva et al . Virology Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 275 the role of children in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , particularly in settings with prolonged indoor expo - sure . Children , even if they experience milder symp - toms , can still play a crucial role in spreading the virus to more vulnerable populations , such as the elderly . This emphasizes the importance of continued vigilance and public health measures , especially given the uncer - tainty surrounding new variants like Omicron and its sub - lineages . As we move forward , the study under - scores the need for a balanced approach to COVID - 19 prevention and control . Vaccination efforts are crucial , but it’s essential to recognize that children , especially the younger ones , often remain unvaccinated and can still contribute to virus transmission . Therefore , rein - stating mask mandates , improving ventilation in pub - lic spaces , and implementing rigorous therapeutic protocols are recommended as part of a comprehen - sive strategy to control the virus , particularly during the autumn and winter months . This research serves as a timely reminder that the fight against COVID - 19 is ongoing , and we must adapt our strategies to evolv - ing circumstances , including emerging variants and the role of different demographic groups in transmission . It underscores the importance of maintaining a multifac - eted approach to minimize the risks associated with the virus and protect public health .
