ORIGINAL ARTICLE Steroid effects on osteogenesis through mesenchymal cell gene expression Xudong Li Æ Li Jin Æ Quanjun Cui Æ Gwo - Jaw Wang Gary Balian Received : 5 January 2004 / Accepted : 12 April 2004 / Published online : 15 June 2004 (cid:1) International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2004 Abstract We have studied the mechanism of steroid - in - duced osteonecrosis by examining the eﬀect of dexa - methasone on a multipotential cell line , D1 , which is derived from bone marrow and is capable of diﬀerenti - ating into either the osteoblast or the adipocyte lineage . The expression of bone cell and fat cell transcription factors Cbfa1 / Runx2 and PPAR c 2 , were determined . Osteocalcin promoter activity was measured by co - transfecting the cells with the phOC - luc and pSV b - Gal plasmids . Dexamethasone increased PPAR c 2 gene expression 2 - fold , while Cbfa1 / Runx2 gene expression and osteocalcin promoter activity decreased by 50 – 60 % , and VEGF protein , measured by ELISA , decreased by 55 % . These changes indicate enhanced adipogenesis and decreased osteogenesis by mesenchymal cells in vitro , together with a decrease in VEGF , a potent angiogeneic factor , suggesting that dexamethasone may shunt uncommitted osteoprogenitor cells in marrow from osteoblastic diﬀerentiation into the adipocytic pathway , leading to diminished vascularization and eventual osteonecrosis . Keywords Adipogenesis Æ Dexamethasone Æ Mesenchymal cells Æ Osteogenesis Æ Osteonecrosis Æ Vascular endothelial growth factor Introduction The association between steroid administration and the development of osteonecrosis has been well established since 1957 . However , the precise pathogenesis of osteo - necrosis remains unknown [ 1 , 2 ] . Investigations on the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis have so far focused on either diminished blood supply to bone or marrow cell diﬀerentiation [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] . The pathobiological mechanism underlying the induction of adipogenesis and suppression of osteogen - esis by steroids has not been elucidated , to our knowl - edge . In our initial report [ 6 ] , we demonstrated that dexamethasone stimulates bone marrow mesenchymal cell diﬀerentiation into adipocytes as well as the accu - mulation of fat in the marrow while suppressing cell diﬀerentiation into osteoblasts ; nevertheless , the mech - anism is still not clear . It is likely that interconversion of stromal cells among phenotypes , as well as commitment to a particular lineage with suppression of alternative phenotypes , is governed by speciﬁc transcription factors [ 7 , 8 ] . Indeed , core binding factor a1 / Runt - related tran - scription factor - 2 ( Cbfa1 / Runx2 ) is a transcription fac - tor that is required to commit mesenchymal progenitors to the osteoblast lineage [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] . Mice that are deﬁcient in this factor lack osteoblasts and mineralized bone matrix [ 12 ] . Expression of Cbfa1 / Runx2 in ﬁbro - blastic cells induces transcription of osteoblast speciﬁc factors [ 13 ] . By contrast , peroxisome proliferator acti - vated receptor c 2 ( PPAR c 2 ) gene expression destines cells for adipocyte diﬀerentiation [ 14 , 15 ] . Transfection of ﬁbroblastic cells with PPAR c 2 and subsequent acti - vation with an appropriate ligand causes the develop - ment of adipocytes , supporting the idea that PPAR c 2 plays a crucial role in the diﬀerentiation of mesenchymal Osteoporos Int ( 2005 ) 16 : 101 – 108 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00198 - 004 - 1649 - 7 X .

The eﬀect of dexamethasone on cell diﬀerentiation through its inﬂuence on transcription factors needs to be elucidated . Meanwhile , many authors have suggested that interference with the blood supply , by various means , plays a major role in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis [ 2 , 17 ] . Intraosseous hypertension [ 18 ] , intravascular fat emboli and coagulation [ 19 , 20 ] compression of vessels by progressive accumulation of marrow fat stores [ 21 ] and coagulopathies are commonly accepted theories . Such theories have focused on decreased blood supply as the underlying factor for osteonecrosis . There are few reports on the angiogenic changes that ensue upon treatment of mesenchymal cells with dexamethasone ; however , normal and pathological bone physiology is inexorably tied to angiogenesis [ 22 ] . There are several indications that vasculature plays an important role for the mechanism of coupling resorption by osteo - clasts and bone formation by osteoblasts [ 23 ] . There is a functional relationship between bone endothelium and osteoblasts , although the mechanism is not clear . Recent reports document the important role of angiogenic factors in skeletal development and in disorders of the skeleton . The process of bone devel - opment and repair depends on adequate formation of new capillaries from existing blood vessel [ 24 ] . Angiogenesis , the development of a microvascular network for blood supply , is critical for the develop - ment , remodeling , and healing of most tissues , including bone [ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ] . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , a dimeric heparin - binding glycoprotein , plays a central role in the development and modulation of angiogenesis and has been studied extensively ; moreover , VEGF – mediated angiogenesis is important in fracture repair [ 28 ] and endochondral ossiﬁcation [ 29 ] . Thus , it appeared promising to investigate the role of angiogenic factors , speciﬁcally VEGF , in osteoporosis and osteonecrosis . Understanding the eﬀects of dexamethasone on bone and fat cell transcription factors , and changes in VEGF during mesenchymal cell diﬀerentiation , are clearly important in order to elucidate the mechanism of steroid induced osteonecrosis . This study was de - signed in an attempt to answer two questions . First , do steroids induce adipogenesis and suppress osteo - genesis by regulating transcription factors PPAR c 2 and Cbfa1 / Runx2 ? Second , will steroid decrease angiogenesis by decreasing VEGF expression ? We examined the eﬀect of dexamethasone on a multipo - tential bone marrow cell line , D1 , which was previ - ously cloned from mouse bone marrow stroma and shown to produce a mineralized matrix as well as adipogenesis in vivo [ 30 ] . The treatment of D1 cells with dexamethasone in vitro showed diminished gene expression for Cbfa1 / Runx2 , and an increase in PPAR c 2 , consistent with inhibition of osteogenesis and enhanced adipogenesis in vitro . In addition , VEGF production was suppressed upon treatment of mesen - chymal cells with dexamethasone in vitro . Materials and methods Steroid induced adipogenesis in culture Multipotential mesenchymal cells , D1 , which were cloned from Balb / c mouse bone marrow cells , were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium ( Gibco BRL , Gaithersburg , Md . , USA ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone Laboratories , Logan , Vt . , USA ) , 50 l g / ml sodium ascorbate , and 100 IU / ml pen - icillin G and 100 l g streptomycin per ml of culture media , in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % carbon diox - ide at 37 (cid:2) C . For all experiments , cells were seeded at a density of 5 · 10 3 cells per cm 2 and the experiments were started when the cells reached 80 % conﬂuence . D1 cells were treated with ﬁve diﬀerent concentra - tions of dexamethasone ( Sigma Chemical Company , St Louis , Mo . , USA ) between 10 ) 9 and 10 ) 5 mol / l . Cell morphology and the appearance of cytoplasmic lipid droplets were monitored with a phase contrast micro - scope . To determine the number of adipocytes , cells in culture were stained with Sudan IV , a stain for fat , counterstained with hematoxylin , and scanned using a Nikon 35 mm slide scanner ( Nikon Inc . , Melville , N . Y . , USA ) . Semiquantitative RT - PCR Semiquantitative RT - PCR was carried out according to the Ambion ( Ambion , Austin , Tex . , USA ) protocol based on the Competimer Technique . This method has been validated to be semiquantitative with data that has correlation coeﬃcients of – 0 . 97 [ 8 , 31 ] . By mixing prim - ers for 18S rRNA with Ambion’s exclusive competimers ( primers of the same sequence but that cannot be ex - tended ) , the 18S rRNA signal can be reduced even to the level of rare messages . It provides semiquantitative data on relative changes of a given mRNA when ampliﬁed with the optimal ratio of 18S primers : competimers for a ﬁxed number of PCR cycles within the liner range [ 32 ] . RNA ( 0 . 5 l g ) was reverse transcribed in 20 l l buﬀer containing AMV reverse transcriptase 5 · 2 . 5 l mol / l poly dT , 1 mmol / l each of dATP , dCTP , dGTP , dTTP , 20 IU of RNAse inhibitor , and 20 IU of AMV RT . The reverse transcription reaction was incubated at room tempera - ture for 10 min and then in a Perkin - Elmer Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler at 42 (cid:2) C for 15 min , 99 (cid:2) C for 5 min , and then at 5 (cid:2) C for 5 min . Aliquots of cDNA were ampliﬁed in a 100 l l PCR reaction mixture which contained 0 . 3 l mol / l of 5’ and 3’ oligoprimers , in high - ﬁdelity PCR buﬀer containing 15 mmol / l MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 nmol / l each of dATP , dCTP , dGTP , and dTTP , 0 . 35 IU of high - ﬁdelity Taq DNA polymerase . For each cDNA sample , PCR ampliﬁcation was performed in triplicate . The identity of PCR products was conﬁrmed by sequence analysis in an automated DNA sequencer ( Perkin - Elmer , Norwalk , Conn . , USA ) . 102 The primer sequences for PCR were : for Cbfa1 / Runx2 : mCbfa1 / Runx2 + 515 . F - 5’ACG ACA ACC GCA CCA TGG T - 3’ ; mCbfa1 / Runx2 + 1382 . R - 5’CGG CTC TCA GTG AGG GAT G - 3’ ; for PPAR c 2 : mPPAR c 2 + 1111 . F - 5’CTG GCC TCC CTG ATG AAT AA - 3’ ; mPPAR c 2 + 1315 . R - 5’GGC GGT CTC CAC TGA GAA TA - 3’ . For mCbfa1 / Runx2 , ampliﬁcation by PCR was per - formed at thermal cycling parameters of 94 (cid:2) C for 30 s , 60 (cid:2) C for 30 s and 72 (cid:2) C for 30 s for 34 cycles followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72 (cid:2) C for 7 min . For mPPAR c 2 , ampliﬁcation was carried out with 30 cycles of 94 (cid:2) C for 15 s , 50 (cid:2) C for 15 s and 65 (cid:2) C for 30 s followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72 (cid:2) C for 2 min . For each PCR product mixture , 5 l l was analyzed by electrophoresis in 3 % ( w / v ) agarose gels . The ampliﬁed DNA fragments were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide . Photo - graphs were scanned using a ScanJet II cx ( Hewlett Packard , Calif . , USA ) . Relative quantitative data was obtained using ImageQuant Software ( Molecular Dynamics , Aunnyvale , Calif . , USA ) . Quantitative diﬀerences were normalized with the QuantumRNA 18S PCR products ( Ambion , Austin , Tex . , USA ) . Transient reporter gene assays D1 cells at a density of 3 · 10 5 per well in six - well culture plates were maintained in culture media until they reached 60 – 80 % conﬂuence . Cells were co - transfected with two DNA constructs : ( 1 ) human osteocalcin pro - moter luciferase - fusion plasmid ( phOC - luc ; 3 l g ) , and ( 2 ) pSV b - gal plasmid ( 0 . 5 l g ) , using a DOSPER Liposomal Transfection protocol ( Roche , Boehringer Mannheim ) . The cells were transfected with 60 l l DO - SPER / DNA complexes for 6 h in 1 ml fresh culture medium without serum and maintained in culture for an additional 24 – 48 h in complete growth media . Lucifer - ase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit ( Promega , Madison , Wisc . , USA ) and luminescence was detected with an Optocom I luminometer ( MGM Instruments , Cambridge , Mass . , USA ) . b - Galactosidase activity was measured with a commercial kit using a colorimetric assay ( Promega ) . Luciferase activity was normalized against b - galactosidase activity . VEGF assay Cell culture supernatants were collected at 12 , 24 and 48 h for the time - course studies with 10 ) 7 mol / l dexa - methasone , or after 24 h for the dose - response studies with 10 ) 9 mol / l , 10 ) 7 mol / l , 1 ) 5 mol / l dexamethasone . VEGF was measured by ELISA ( R & D Systems , Min - neapolis , Minn . , USA ) , which recognizes mouse VEGF 164 , the predominant isoform ( cross - reactivity > 95 % ) . The detection limit of the assay was 3 pg / ml VEGF . Intra - assay coeﬃcient of variation was 4 . 7 % , and the inter - assay coeﬃcient of variation was 6 . 4 % . Statistical methods All experiments were performed in triplicate , and evaluated by ANOVA for statistical signiﬁcance . The data are presented as the mean±SD at a signiﬁcance level of P < 0 . 05 . Results Cells treated with increasing concentrations of dexa - methasone , from 10 ) 9 to 10 ) 5 mol / l , accumulated lipid vesicles that were small initially and increased in size with time . The lipid vesicles were clearly distinguishable from the surrounding cells by phase contrast microscopy ( Fig . 1 ) and with Sudan IV , a stain that is characteristic of neutral lipid in fat cells . Adipogenic changes were not found in D1 cells that were not treated with dexameth - asone . Dexamethasone increases PPAR c 2 mRNA To determine the eﬀect of diﬀerent concentrations of dexamethasone on PPAR c 2 mRNA , D1 cells were incubated for 48 h with dexamethasone concentrations from 10 ) 9 to 10 ) 5 mol / l . Gene expression was quantiﬁed by RT - PCR analysis and is presented graphically in Fig . 2A . Within the range of dexamethasone concen - trations used in our study , PPAR c 2 mRNA levels in - creased to between 121 % and 235 % of controls ( Fig . 2A ) . The increase was signiﬁcant from 10 ) 8 mol / l to 10 ) 5 mol / l dexamethasone treatment ( P < 0 . 05 ) , while there was no signiﬁcant PPAR c 2 mRNA expression increase with 10 ) 9 mol / l dexamethasone treatment ( P > 0 . 05 ) . To examine the time course eﬀect , RNA was prepared from D1 cells after culture in the presence of 10 ) 7 mol / l dexamethasone for 12 h and 1 , 2 , and 4 days , and compared with non - treated control cells at the same time points . Analysis by RT - PCR ( Fig . 2B ) showed a signiﬁcant increase in PPAR c 2 mRNA at 12 h ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and further increases through the ﬁnal time point of 4 days . At this time , PPAR c 2 mRNA had in - creased to approximately 190 % of control levels ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Dexamethasone down - regulates Cbfa1 mRNA To determine Cbfa1 / Runx2 mRNA in response to dexamethasone , D1 cells were incubated for 48 h with concentrations of 10 ) 9 to 10 ) 5 mol / l dexamethasone and analyzed by RT - PCR ( Fig . 3A ) . With 10 ) 9 mol / l dexamethasone , the level of Cbfa1 / Runx2 mRNA was essentially the same as in non - treated control cells ( P > 0 . 05 ) , while treatment with 10 ) 8 mol / l dexameth - asone decreased Cbfa1 / Runx2 mRNA signiﬁcantly to around 85 % of control ( P < 0 . 05 ) . At 10 ) 7 to 10 ) 5 mol / l dexamethasone treatment , expression of 103 Cbfa1 / Runx2 mRNA was approximately 50 % of the untreated control cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . To exam - ine the time course of down - regulation of Cbfa1 / Runx2 mRNA , RNA was prepared from D1 cells after culture in the presence of 10 ) 7 mol / l dexameth - asone for 12 h and 1 , 2 , and 4 days , and from non - treated control cells at the same time points . Analysis by RT - PCR showed that a small decrease in Cbfa1 / Runx2 mRNA ( to 75 % of the control cells ) at 12 h ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and a further decrease through the ﬁnal time point of 4 days to 47 % of control levels ( Fig . 3B ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Dexamethasone decreases activity of the osteocalcin promoter To characterize the inhibitory eﬀect on osteoblastic transactivation potential of dexamethasone , we studied the eﬀect of dexamethasone on osteocalcin promoter activity . Treatment of cells with 10 ) 7 mol / l dexametha - sone resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in osteocalcin promoter activity ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 1 – 3 days ( Table 1 ) . Dexamethasone decreases VEGF To investigate the eﬀect of dexamethasone on VEGF gene expression , D1 cells were treated with dexametha - sone concentrations from 10 ) 9 to 10 —5 mol / l . Cell cul - ture supernatants were collected at 12 , 24 , and 48 h for the time - course study and at 24 h for the comparison of the eﬀect of diﬀerent concentrations of dexamethasone . A concentration - dependent inhibition eﬀect was de - tected after 24 h of treatment with dexamethasone ( Fig . 4A ) .

Discussion The increased use of steroids for immunosuppression after organ transplantation , as treatment for rheumatoid diseases and severe adult respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , and for chemotherapy , has resulted in an increased risk of osteonecrosis [ 33 ] . Glucocorticoids have been the focus of studies on the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis . Although statistical data show that steroids may be implicated in one - third of all cases of osteonecrosis [ 34 ] , the precise mechanism of action of the steroids on cells has not been determined [ 19 , 20 ] to our knowledge . We have demonstrated previously that the multi - potential bone marrow cell line D1 responds to treatment with dexamethasone by diﬀerentiating into fat cells and by expressing an adipose - speciﬁc gene , 422 ( aP2 ) , that increases with higher doses and pro - longed treatment . There are also reports that gluco - corticoids aﬀect osteoblasts by down - regulating type - I collagen and osteocalcin gene expression [ 35 ] and inducing osteoblast and osteocyte apopotosis [ 36 , 37 ] . Dexamethasone has also been reported to promote the expression of markers of the osteoblast phenotype in cultures of rat marrow stromal ﬁbroblasts [ 38 ] . Glucocorticoids can have various eﬀects on bone cells , depending on the state of cellular diﬀerentiation , ani - mal species , and the dose and duration of treatment [ 39 ] . The eﬀect on human marrow cells and mouse cells is to inhibit matrix synthesis . Consistent with other reports [ 16 , 40 , 41 ] , our results demonstrate that dexamethasone down - regulates the expression of Table 1 Eﬀect of dexamethasone on osteocalcin promoter activity . Values are expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity to b - Gal activity ( mean±SD ) and represent results from two separate experiments .

VEGF expression in supernatant medium of the D1 cells treated with diﬀerent concentrations of dexamethasone ( A ) for 24 h and 10 ) 7 mol / l dexamethasone for diﬀerent time points ( B ) was assessed by ELISA . Absorbance at 405 nm was measured . Each column shows mean±SD of data from three experiments 105 Cbfa1 / Runx2 and osteocalcin promoter activity while it increases the expression of PPAR c 2 . The previously unexplained eﬀects of glucocorticoids on bone loss may result from down - regulation of osteoblast tran - scription factor expression with concomitant up - regu - lation of the adipocyte transcription factor , leading to the diﬀerentiation of bone marrow stromal cells along the adipocytic lineage . Since adipocytes and osteo - blasts share a common pool of progenitor cells , when exogenous stimulators shift the diﬀerentiation of marrow stem cells into the adipocyte lineage , the os - teoprogenitor cell pool may not be suﬃcient to pro - vide enough osteoblasts in order to meet the need for bone remodeling , fracture healing , or repair of ne - crotic bone . In addition , marrow stem cells that have already diﬀerentiated into osteoblasts would develop apoptotic changes [ 36 , 42 ] on treatment with gluco - corticoids , accounting for the decline in bone forma - tion and trabecular width . Thus , decreased production of osteoblasts and accumulation of apoptotic osteo - cytes may contribute to osteonecrosis eventually . Furthermore , the increase in volume of fatty marrow with a concomitant increase in intraosseous pressure could decrease blood ﬂow in a semi - intact osseous compartment , eventually leading to ischemia and osteonecrosis [ 18 ] . Blood vessels are present in each bone multicellular unit ( BMU ) . The vessels are located in the center of the BMU between the osteoclasts advancing at the end of the cavity and the osteoblasts lining the walls farther behind . Since the capillaries in bone grow at the same rate as the BMU advances , angiogenesis , the formation of new vessels from pre - existing capillaries , might be an integral process during bone remodeling and the sequential expression of peptides during angiogenesis might have a strong impact on the mechanism of cou - pling of bone resorption and bone formation . VEGF is a key regulator of vasculogenesis in the embryo and angiogenesis in adult tissues . Impaired VEGF expression has been reported in some diseases that are related to angiogenic disorders such as dia - betic retinopathy , ﬁbrovascular disease and tumor growth . An important physiological role for VEGF in bone was reported by Gerber et al . [ 29 ] , as blocking VEGF - mediated capillary invasion inhibited both bone formation and resorption in the growth plate . More recent evidence indicates that expression of VEGF is important for normal endochondral bone develop - ment , not only to mediate bone vascularization but also to allow normal diﬀerentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes , osteoblasts and osteoclasts [ 24 , 37 , 43 ] . VEGF is expressed in the normal rat tibia . Addi - tionally , VEGF expression in osteoblasts and osteo - blast - like cells is increased by several cytokines and growth factors , including prostaglandin E 1 ( PGE1 ) and PGE2 , insulin - like growth factor ( IGF ) , platelet - derived growth factor , and 1 , 2 , 3 - dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [ 44 , 45 , 46 ] . The VEGF gene has been reported to have 5’ AP - 1 binding sites . AP - 1 , a dimeric transcription factor composed of the Fos and Jun proteins , has been shown to be potently inhibited by dexamethasone [ 47 ] . Down - regulation of VEGF expression by dexa - methasone has previously been demonstrated in rat glioma cells [ 48 ] , human vascular smooth muscle cells [ 49 ] , mouse and rat pituitary folliculostellate cells [ 50 ] and porcine brain endothelial cells [ 51 ] . Dexametha - sone has been shown to block prostaglandin stimula - tion of VEGF production in osteoblastic cells [ 44 ] . In vitro , dexamethasone produced a dose - dependent inhibition of TGF - b 1 - induced VEGF protein produc - tion and this observation may provide an additional explanation for the well - documented phenomenon of both impaired fracture vascularization and healing in glucocorticoid - treated patients . In this study , we have demonstrated that the decrease in VEGF upon treatment with dexamethasone is both dose and time dependent . Down - regulation of VEGF by glucocorticoids is directly responsible for disturbed angiogenesis , resulting in the observed defects in capil - lary architecture , which eventually lead to osteonecrosis . It is suggested that the mechanism of steroid - induced necrosis is through the inhibition of angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF . In conclusion , there may be at least two mechanisms that are involved in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis . First , glucocorticoids down - regulate osteoblast tran - scription factor gene expression and , by up - regulating adipocyte transcription factor gene expression , could lead to the diﬀerentiation of bone marrow stromal cells along the adipocytic lineage . Second , glucocorticoids decrease angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF . Conse - quently , the action of glucocorticoids may impair mes - enchymal cell diﬀerentiation and thereby decrease blood supply leading to bone cell death . References 1 .
