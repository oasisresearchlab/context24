A 100 , 000 - molecular - weight protein , barely detectable on the Y or CL cell surface , appeared as the main surface antigen of the G metacyclic trypomastigotes . In addition , the G metacyclic forms differed from those of the virulent strains in their susceptibility to complement - mediated immunolysis . Trypanosoma cruzi , the causative agent of Chagas ' disease , is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle . In vertebrate hosts T . cruzi is found as intracellular amastigotes and blood - stream trypomastigotes , whereas epimastigotes multiply in the digestive tract of insect vectors . Epimastigotes can further differentiate to form metacyclic trypomastigotes which are infective to mammalian hosts . Clinical manifestations of infection by T . cruzi vary widely , but the cause of such diversity is unclear . Since the variability of the clinical picture of Chagas ' disease may reflect infection by distinct T . cruzi strains ( 2 ) , attempts have been made to characterize strains of T . cruzi , particularly by analyzing the cell surface compo - nents ( 1 , 12 , 14 ) . However , by using either amastigotes , blood trypomastigotes , or culture epimastigotes , the presence of common , rather than strain - specific , surface antigens has been reported . The present work is aimed at characterizing the surface components of metacyclic trypomas - tigotes , which so far have been poorly studied , and at verifying the possibility of distinguishing strains of T . cruzi through the determination of the surface antigen makeup at this developmen - tal stage . Three strains of T . cruzi were used : Y , isolat - ed from an acute case of Chagas ' disease ( 13 ) ; CL , derived from the vector Triatoma infestans ( 3 ) ; and G ( obtained from E . P . Camargo and originally from Mena Barreto ) , isolated from an opossum in the Amazon region . The parasites were maintained through cyclic passages in out - bred albino mice and in the triatomid Dipetalo - gaster maximus . Short - time cultures were estab - lished by seeding blood trypomastigotes from infected mice into liver infusion - tryptose medi - um ( 4 ) . Parasites were maintained in this medi - um for four to five passages . To obtain pure trypomastigotes , cultures of T . cruzi in liver infusion - tryptose medium were harvested , washed twice in phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 5 . 4 % glucose , and then passed through a DEAE - cellulose column , using the same buffer for the eluent . The eluate contained 99 to 100 % metacyclic trypomastigotes , whereas epimastigotes were retained on the top of the column . Immune sera were prepared by injecting rab - bits with four doses of purified metacyclic trypo - mastigotes of strain Y or G killed either by heating at 50째C for 10 min or by treatment with merthiolate ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) for 10 min . Anti - CL serum was produced in rabbits by giving two intravenous injections of 108 live culture forms at 15 - day intervals . Human immune sera were from Hospital das Clinicas , Sao Paulo , Brazil . Surface labeling of the parasites with 131I was carried out by the Iodo - Gen method ( 11 ) , as described by Carmago et al . ( 5 ) . Metacyclic trypomastigotes iodinated by this procedure re - tained full infectivity to mice . The iodinated parasites were treated with Nonidet P - 40 at a final concentration of 0 . 5 % in the presence of the following protease inhibitors : leupeptin ( 25 , ug / ml ) , antipain ( 25 , ug / ml ) , and phenylmethyl - sulfonyl fluoride ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) ( 1 mM ) . The supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 8 , 000 x g for 10 min was used as parasite extract . Labeled extracts were immunoprecipi - tated with various immune sera , according to the procedure of Kessler ( 6 ) as previously described ( 16 ) . Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 10 ) was performed in slab gels , using 3 % and 5 to 12 % gradient gels for the stacking and running gels , respectively . After fixation in 25 % methanol - 7 % acetic acid solu - tion , the gel was dried and exposed to an X - ray 836 on A ugu s t 27 , 201 7 b y gue s t h tt p : / / i a i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m NOTES 837 a b c MW 94k - 67 k - _ m _ s _ 43 k - 30 k - FIG . 1 .

Proteins with molecular weights ranging from 14 , 000 to 94 , 000 ( Pharma - cia Fine Chemicals ) were used as markers . I observed a considerable difference in the patterns of 131I - labeled extracts of metacyclic trypomastigotes of strains Y , CL , and G ( Fig . 1 ) . Two surface components with apparent molecu - lar weights of 70 , 000 and 85 , 000 were shared by the three strains of T . cruzi . In addition to these , a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 60 , 000 appeared as a strong band in the CL extracts , whereas in the G extract a 100 , 000 - molecular - weight band of high intensity was detected . Upon reaction of the parasite extracts with the various immune sera , sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates revealed a remarkable dif - ference in the G surface antigens , as compared with those of strain Y or CL ( Fig . 2 ) . The most prominent band of the G extract , i . e . , the 100 , 000 - molecular - weight protein , was also the main component immunoprecipitated with the rabbit anti - G serum ( Fig . 2A , lane b ) . This antigen was also recognized as a weak band by the anti - CL serum and as a strong band by one of the sera from chronically infected patients ( Fig . 2A , lanes d and e , respectively ) . In con - trast , the 100 , 000 - molecular - weight component could not be detected on the Y or CL cell surfaces by the same rabbit anti - G serum ( data not shown ) or by the chagasic human serum ( Fig . 2B , lanes c and g ) , which strongly react with G metacyclic forms . Furthermore , the immunoprecipitation patterns of Y and CL ex - tracts with anti - Y and anti - CL rabbit sera ( Fig . 2B , lanes a , b , e , and f ) were very similar to each other and differed from those of strain G ( Fig . 2A , lanes c and d ) . The surface antigen profile of Y and CL metacyclic trypomastigotes in this study differs from that reported by Nogueira et al . ( 12 ) , which could in part be ascribed to the fact that I labeled the parasites with 131I instead of 125I , using the a b c d e f Mw 94k - " _ _ w 6 7 - 67 k - 43 k - 30 k - A a b c d e f 9 Mw 94 k - 67 k - amI . . - U . . . . 43 k - 30 k - B FIG . 2 .

Iodo - Gen method . Moreover , it should be point - ed out that whereas previous analysis of T . cruzi surface antigens ( 12 ) has been performed with trypomastigotes either mixed with epimastigotes or contaminated with complement components , I have determined surface antigens of pure meta - cyclic preparations free from extraneous pro - teins , as judged by iodinated patterns of metacy - clic forms obtained in macromolecule - free medium ( 15 ) , which were comparable to those of trypomastigotes derived from liver infusion - tryptose medium . Susceptibility to complement - mediated im - munolysis was another distinctive feature of T . cruzi G , as compared with strains Y and CL . Whereas Y and CL metacyclic forms were re - sistant to in vitro lysis by antisera against the metacyclic stage , G metacyclic trypomastigotes were completely lysed by the same sera in a complement - dependent reaction ( Table 1 ) . In the case of blood trypomastigotes , it has been reported that the parasites are lysed only by sera from animals with ongoing infection ( 7 - 9 ) . Lysis of G metacyclic forms , however , occurred with sera from animals immunized with dead orga - nisms . It is interesting to note that the course of infection in mice inoculated with G metacyclic forms differed significantly from that produced by strains Y and CL .

Parasitemia of mice inoculated with meta - cyclic trypomastigotes of T . cruzi strains Y ( @ ) and CL ( 0 ) . Each mouse received 105 culture trypomastigotes purified through a DEAE - cellulose column . The points represent the mean parasitemia of five animals . 1 purified metacyclic trypomastigotes of strain Y or CL developed high parasitemia ( Fig . 3 ) , and some mortality was also observed . In con - trast , G metacyclic forms repeatedly failed to produce patent parasitemia in mice , even after the injection of 106 or more organisms ( Table 2 ) , and infection could be only indirectly detected by either xenodiagnosis or hemoculture . Taken together , the present findings suggest that determination of surface antigens and sus - ceptibility to complement - mediated immunoly - sis of metacyclic trypomastigotes may be a valuable tool to distinguish virulent and nonviru - lent strains of T . cruzi .
