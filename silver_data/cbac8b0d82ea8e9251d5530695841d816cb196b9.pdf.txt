Summary Python is currently the fastest growing programming language in the world , thanks to its ease - of - use , fast learning curve and its numerous high quality packages for data science and machine - learning . Surprisingly however , Python is far behind the R programming language when it comes to general statistics and for this reason many scientists still rely heavily on R to perform their statistical analyses . In this paper , we present Pingouin , an open - source Python package aimed at partially filling this gap by providing easy - to - use functions for computing some of the main sta - tistical tests that scientists use on an every day basis . This includes basics functions such as ANOVAs , ANCOVAs , post - hoc tests , non - parametric tests , effect sizes , as well as more advanced functions such as Bayesian T - tests ( Rouder , Speckman , Sun , Morey , & Iverson , 2009 ) , repeated measures correlations ( Bakdash & Marusich , 2017 ) , robust correlations ( Pernet , Wilcox , & Rousselet , 2012 ) and circular statistics ( Berens , 2009 ) , to cite but a few . Pingouin is written in Python 3 and is mostly built on top of the Pandas ( McKinney , 2010 ) library , therefore allowing a fluid integration within a data analysis pipeline . Pingouin comes with an extensive documentation and API as well as with several Jupyter notebook examples . References Bakdash , J . Z . , & Marusich , L . R . ( 2017 ) .
