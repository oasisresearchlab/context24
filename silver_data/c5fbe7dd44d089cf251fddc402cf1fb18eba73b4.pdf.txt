I M M U N O L O G Y Rab13 acts downstream of the kinase Mst1 to deliver the integrin LFA - 1 to the cell surface for lymphocyte trafficking Akihiko Nishikimi , 1 Sayaka Ishihara , 1 Madoka Ozawa , 2 Kan Etoh , 3 Mitsunori Fukuda , 3 Tatsuo Kinashi , 2 , 4 Koko Katagiri 1 , 4 * In lymphocytes , the kinase Mst1 is required for the proper organization of integrins in the plasma membrane at the leading edge of migrating cells , which is critical for lymphocyte trafficking . We found a functional link between the small G protein Rab13 and Mst1 in lymphocyte adhesion and migration . In response to stimu - lation of T lymphocytes with chemokine , Mst1 promoted phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide ex - change factor DENND1C ( differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells domain 1C ) , which activated Rab13 . Active Rab13 associated with Mst1 to facilitate the delivery of the integrin LFA - 1 ( lympho - cyte function – associated antigen 1 ) to the leading edge of lymphocytes . Delivery of LFA - 1 involved the re - cruitment of myosin Va along actin filaments , which extended as a result of the localization of the actin regulatory protein VASP to the cell periphery through phosphorylation of VASP at Ser 157 by Mst1 . Inhibition of Rab13 function reduced the adhesion and migration of lymphocytes on ICAM - 1 ( intercellular adhesion molecule – 1 ) , the ligand for LFA - 1 , and inhibited the formation of a ring - like arrangement of LFA - 1 at the con - tact sites between T cells and antigen - presenting cells . The lymphoid tissues of Rab13 - deficient mice had reducednumbersoflymphocytesbecauseof thedefectivetraffickingcapabilityofthesecells . Theseresults suggest that Rab13actswithMst1toregulatethespatialdistribution of LFA - 1and themotilityandtrafficking of lymphocytes . INTRODUCTION Lymphocyte adhesion and migration are important for the generation and execution of immune and inflammatory responses . Therefore , defining the molecular mechanisms that control cell attachment and movement is essen - tial to understand immune responses . The b 2 integrin LFA - 1 ( lymphocyte function – associated antigen 1 , also known as CD11a / CD18 and integrin a L b 2 ) and its ligand ICAM - 1 ( intercellular adhesion molecule – 1 ) are major adhesion molecules involved in lymphocyte trafficking ( 1 , 2 ) . Central to their functions is the unique ability of integrins to regulate their adhesive activity through a process termed “ inside - out ” signaling . The small guano - sine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) Rap1 is rapidly activated by chemokines and cognate antigens , increases the adhesiveness of integrins to their ligands by modulating their affinity and avidity , induces polarized cell shape changes , and facilitates cell migration ( 3 , 4 ) . RAPL is a Rap1 - GTP – binding protein that mediates the ability of Rap1 to increase adhesion through LFA - 1 ( 5 ) . RAPL interacts with and activates the serine and threonine kinase Mst1 ( the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila Hpo protein ) and forms a complex with the a L integrin subunit to modulate integrin activity through Mst1 in lymphocytes ( 6 ) , althoughMst1isperhapsbestknownforcontrollingorgan size through regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis ( 7 ) . Mice defi - cient in these effector molecules or in Rap1 exhibit diminished integrin clustering and function , as well as defective cell polarity , which leads to the impaired trafficking of lymphocytes , dendritic cells , and thymocytes , and indicates that these molecules play crucial roles in the efficient trafficking of immune cells ( 8 – 11 ) . We previously showed that the Rap1 - RAPL - Mst1 signaling pathway stim - ulates the clustering of LFA - 1 at the leading edge of lymphocytes , which is thought to generate new adhesion points at the front membrane , thereby contributing to the robust migration of lymphocytes on ICAM - 1 ( 6 , 12 ) . ThisinducedadhesionisdependentontheassociationofLFA - 1withRAPL through the cytoplasmic region of the a L chain ( 5 ) . Notably , a mutant a L subunit lacking this cytoplasmic region exhibits defective chemokine - dependent clustering at the cell surface ( 5 ) . Although this LFA - 1 mutant is uniformly distributed over the cell body and uropod , it is absent from the leading edge of polarized cells ( 5 ) . This suggests that LFA - 1 clustering depends on intracellular trafficking , rather than on the lateral diffusion of LFA - 1 . Consistent with this notion , RAPL and Mst1 colocalize tovesicular compartments enriched for Rap1 and LFA - 1 , and they are dynamically translocatedwithLFA - 1totheleadingedgeoflymphocytes , suggestingthat the RAPL - Mst1 complex exerts a regulatory role in the intracellular transport of LFA - 1 ( 6 ) . Rab proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases , and they function as molecular switches to control diverse stages of vesicular traffic ( 13 ) . More than 60 mammalian Rab proteins localize to different cellular compartments and control distinct transportsystems . Integrin trafficking in - volves transit through specific Rab - containing compartments in the cell . The Rab5 family member Rab21 and the Rab11 family member Rab25 di - rectly interact with b 1 integrins and play important roles in the intracellular distribution of integrins ( 14 – 16 ) . Although LFA - 1 ( a L b 2 ) is endocytosed through a Rab5 - independent , cholesterol - sensitive pathway and recycles in a Rab11 - dependent manner through a YXX F motif in the cytoplasmic region of the b 2 subunit ( 17 – 19 ) , little is known about specific regulators of the a L - dependentactivationofLFA - 1 . Rab13 , Rab10 , andRab8constitutea subfamily of closely related Rab proteins , but the greatest degree of conser - vation in these proteins is found in the first 100 N - terminal amino acid 1 DepartmentofBiosciences , SchoolofScience , KitasatoUniversity , 1 - 15 - 1Kitasato , Minami - ku , Sagamihara , Kanagawa 252 - 0373 , Japan . 2 Department of Molecular Genetics , InstituteofBiomedicalScience , KansaiMedicalUniversity , 2 - 5 - 1Shinmachi , Hirakata , Osaka 573 - 1010 , Japan . 3 Laboratory of Membrane Trafficking Mech - anisms , Department of Developmental Biology and Neurosciences , Graduate School of Life Sciences , Tohoku University , Aobayama , Aoba - ku , Sendai , Miyagi 980 - 8578 , Japan . 4 CREST , JapanScienceandTechnologyAgency , 7Gobancho , Chiyoda - ku , Tokyo 102 - 0076 , Japan . * Corresponding author .

The amino acid determinants of specific effector regions in the C - terminal regions of these proteins are divergent , which suggests that each molecule has dis - tinct functions ( 20 ) . Rab13 and its effector protein MICAL - L2 ( molecule interacting with CasL - like 2 ) are involved in the polarized transport of cell adhesion molecules to tight junctions in epithelial cells ( 21 ) . Here , we demonstrated that the previously uncharacterized Mst1 – DENND1C ( differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells domain 1C ) – Rab13 signaling pathway is crucial for LFA - 1 – and ICAM - 1 – dependent adhesion and migration in lymphocytes in response to chemo - kine . We found that lymphocyte trafficking in Rab13 - deficient mice was impaired similarly to that in RAPL - or Mst1 - deficient mice ( 9 , 22 ) , reveal - ing an indispensable function of Rab13 in vivo . Furthermore , Mst1 played roles in the polymerization of F - actin through the phosphorylation at Ser 157 of VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phosphorylation ) , an important regulator of actin network architecture , which was required for the Rab13 - dependent delivery of LFA - 1 to the leading edge of lymphocytes . Thus , Mst1 and Rab13 cooperatively regulate lymphocyte trafficking through the distribution of integrin . RESULTS Mst1 and Rab13 physically interact in lymphocytes To explore the possible involvement of Rab proteins in LFA - 1 trafficking mediated by Mst1 , we examined the interactions between dominant - active ( DA ) and dominant - negative ( DN ) forms of 58 Rab proteins with Mst1 through yeast two - hybrid screening ( 20 ) . Rab13 interacted with Mst1 in a GTP - dependent manner ( table S1 ) , and Rab13 DA colocalized with Mst1 when expressed in COS cells . To confirm the physical interaction between Rab13 and Mst1 , we transfected COS cells with plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – tagged DA ( Q69L ) or DN ( T22N ) mutants of Rab13 and V5 - tagged Mst1 and examined their association through immu - noprecipitation experiments ( Fig . 1A ) . More Mst1 coimmunoprecipitated with Rab13 DA than with Rab13 DN ( Fig . 1A ) . Rab13 DA also physically interacted with endogenous Mst1 in BAF / LFA - 1 cells , mouse pro - B cells ( BAF / 3 cells ) that express human LFA - 1 ( 3 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Mutant forms of Mst1 lacking either the N - terminal or C - terminal regions showed a reduced abilitytointeractwithRab13DA ( Fig . 1C ) , suggestingthatthethree - dimensional structureofMst1isrequiredforbindingtoRab13 . Theseresultssuggestthat the binding of Rab13 to Mst1 is increased by Rab13 activation . We next examined whether Rab13 was activated and interacted with Mst1 in response to chemokine . To pull down Rab13 - GTP , we used gluta - thione S - transferase ( GST ) fused to the Rab13 - binding domain of MICAL - L2 ( MICAL - L2 - C ) , which was identified as a Rab13 - GTP – binding protein byyeasttwo - hybridscreening ( 21 ) . WhereasRab13DAwasreadilyprecipi - tated by GST – MICAL - L2 - C , reduced amounts of Rab13 DN or wild - type Rab13 were precipitated , indicating that GST – MICAL - L2 - C preferably bound to Rab13 - GTP ( Fig . 1D ) . With this GST fusion protein , we observed asubstantialincreaseintheabundanceofRab13 - GTPinBAF / LFA - 1cells within 0 . 5 to 10 min after stimulation with the CXC chemokine CXCL12 ( Fig . 1D ) . About threefold more Mst1 interacted with Rab13 in CXCL12 - stimulated BAF / LFA - 1 cells compared to that in unstimulated cells ( Fig . 1D ) . We next examined whether Mst1 and Rab13 were required for their mu - tual activation . We found that inhibiting Rab13 activation did not affect the kinase activity of Mst1 ( fig . S1A ) . On the other hand , knockdown of Mst1 reducedtheextentofCXCL12 - dependentactivationofRab13toabout10 % of that in control cells ( Fig . 1E ) , suggesting the involvement of Mst1 in the activationofRab13inresponsetochemokine . DENNdomainproteinsarea class of Rab GEFs , and they activate individual Rab GTPases ( 23 ) . Because DENND1C is thought to have GEF activity toward Rab13 ( 23 ) , we examined whether DENND1C could mediate chemokine - induced Rab13 activation in an Mst1 - dependent manner . We found that DENND1C asso - ciated with Mst1 , which promoted the phosphorylation of DENND1C ( Fig . 1F ) . Expression of exogenous DENND1C in transfected COS cells activated Rab13 , and the amount of Rab13 - GTP increased twofold when Mst1 was overexpressed ( Fig . 1G ) , suggesting that the Mst1 - dependent phosphorylation of DENND1Cincreasedits GEFactivity for Rab13 . When BAF / LFA - 1 cells were stimulated with CXCL12 , the abundance of phos - phorylated DENND1C increased fivefold , an increase that was prevented by the knockdown of Mst1 , indicating that DENND1C was phosphorylated in response to chemokine in an Mst1 - dependent manner ( Fig . 1H ) . Further - more , knockdown of DENND1C in BAF / LFA - 1 cells abrogated the activa - tion of Rab13 in response to CXCL12 ( Fig . 1H ) . These results suggest that DENND1C is a substrate of Mst1 , and that it links Mst1 to Rab13 . The distribution of Mst1 is regulated by Rab13 activation , which enables LFA - 1 – dependent adhesion and migration To examine the subcellular localization of Rab13 and Mst1 , we transfected BAF / LFA - 1 cells with plasmids encoding GFP - Rab13 and Mst1 fused to mRFP ( Mst1 - mRFP ) . Wild - type Rab13 was present in the plasma mem - brane and a region around the Golgi in unstimulated cells ( Fig . 2A and fig . S1B ) . As previously reported ( 6 ) , Mst1 was present in a region around the Golgi and cytoplasm ( Fig . 2A ) . When the cells were stimulated with CXCL12 , wild - type Rab13 and Mst1 moved to the leading edgewhere they colocalized ( Fig . 2A and fig . S1B ) . However , Rab13 DN mutant showed a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm , and upon CXCL12 stimulation , Mst1 did not translocate to the leading edge in cells expressing Rab13 DN cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Rab13 DA also localized at the plasma membrane and around Golgi , and was distributed in the cytoplasm , which was adjacent to areas in which Mst1 was localized ( fig . S1 , C and D ) . However , in cells expressing Rab13 DA , Mst1 did not spontaneously translocate to the front membrane , although translocation of Mst1 was more efficient in cells expressing Rab13 DA after stimulation with chemokine ( fig . S1D ) , indicat - ing that Rab13 activation was required , but not sufficient , for the redistribu - tion of Rab13 and Mst1 to the leading edge of polarized cells . Subcellular fractionation by continuous sucrose density gradient centrif - ugation showed that Rab13 and DENND1C were present together in fractions containing light vesicles ( fractions 2 to 4 ) containing endosomal marker proteins ( EEA1 and Rab11 ) , as well as Mst1 and LFA - 1 , in addition to being present together in the heavier fractions , which included Golgi matrixproteinof130kD ( GM130 ) andtransferrinreceptor ( TfR ) , indicative of the Golgi complex ( fractions 8 and 9 ) and the plasma membrane ( fractions 10 to 12 ) ( fig . S2A ) . Extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( ERK ) , which was mainly present in the cytosol , was also found in the hea - vier fractions ( 8 to 12 ) ( fig . S2A ) . Rab13 DA was more abundant in the vesicle - containing fractions than was wild - type Rab13 , suggesting that Rab13 activation promotes its redistribution and association with Mst1 in vesicles . We examined the distribution of Rab13 in Mst1 - knockdown ( Mst1 KD ) cells . As described earlier , after stimulation of cells with CXCL12 , Rab13 accumulated at the leading edge in control cells , but Rab13 clustering was not evident in the Mst1 KD cells ( Fig . 2B ) , consistent with impaired Rab13 activation in these cells ( Fig . 1E ) . Although the cellular localization of Rab13 was normal , the number of Rab13 - rich membrane protrusions was reduced in Mst1 KD cells compared to that in control cells ( Fig . 2B ) , sug - gesting that Mst1 might promote the cytoskeletal assembly required for ve - sicular transport .

We found that the ac - cumulation of Rab13 at the leading edge was also coincident with LFA - 1 clustering ( Fig . 2C and fig . S1E ) . Expression of Rab13 DN in BAF / LFA - 1 cells inhibited LFA - 1 clustering at the leading edge similarly to that in Mst1 KD cells ( Fig . 2C ) ( 6 ) . Consistent with impaired LFA - 1 clustering , cells expressing Rab13 DN demonstrated reduced adhesion to ICAM - 1 in responseto CXCL12 ( Fig . 2D ) .

In addition , we examined whether LFA - 1 clusters were formed by vesicular transport in experiments with pHluorin , which has the unique property of being fluores - cent at a neutral pH and not fluorescent in regions with an acidic pH ( pH < 6 . 0 ) , such as the lumen of vesicles . The pH - sensitive fluorescent pHluorin and mRFP were tagged to the N - terminal extracellular domain and C terminus of a L , respectively , which enabled us to distin - guish LFA - 1 localized on the plasma mem - brane from that localized in intracellular compartments . Analysis of a representative sampleofCXCL12 - stimulatedcellsexpressing pHluorin - a L - mRFP ( fig . S2B ) showed that therearetworegionscontainingLFA - 1 – mRFP , one of which lacked GFP at time zero . Sub - sequently , thesetworegionscoalescedintoa larger GFP - positive region in the protruding membrane that later formed an LFA - 1 – containing cluster . Together , these data sug - gest that Rab13 - GTP – dependent vesicle transport is involved in LFA - 1 clustering and adhesion . Next , we examined the effects of Rab13 on the LFA - 1 – dependent migration of cells on ICAM - 1 . Expression of Rab13 DA in BAF / LFA - 1 cells substantially enhanced CXCL12 - stimulated motility on ICAM - 1 compared to that in control cells ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast , expression of Rab13 DN inhibited CXCL12 - induced migration ( Fig . 3B ) . We also tested Rab8 , a Rab pro - tein closely related to Rab13 , and Rab1 , whichshowedanactiveform – dependentin - teraction with Mst1 in the yeast two - hybrid screen . Expression of a DN form of Rab8 or Rab1 did not substantially affect CXCL12 - induced migration ( Fig . 3B ) . Rab13 accu - mulated at the leading edge and colocalized with LFA - 1 clusters in polarized cells , whereas GFP and GFP - Rab1 did not trans - locate to the leading edge in response to CXCL12 ( Fig . 3C ) . These results suggest that Rab13 exerts specific functions in LFA - 1 – and ICAM - 1 – mediated migration . In experiments with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , we examined the requirement of Rab13 for LFA - 1 – dependent adhesion and migration . The abundance ofRab13protein in Rab13 KD cells was reduced to about 20 % of that in control cells ( fig . S3A ) . LFA - 1 clustering was not induced in Rab13 KD cells in response to CXCL12 ( fig . S3B ) . The ability of BAF / LFA - 1 cells to ad - here to ICAM - 1 in response to CXCL12 was substantially diminished by knockdown of Rab13 ( fig . S3B ) . Furthermore , the dis - placement and velocities of Rab13 KD cells during migration on ICAM - 1 in the presence ofCXCL12werereducedtolessthan15 % of those of control cells ( fig . S3C ) .

Cross - linking the T cell receptor ( TCR ) complex with anti - CD3 antibodies resulted in about a threefold increase in the abun - dance of Rab13 - GTP in primary mouse T cells ( Fig . 3D ) . To examine whether TCR - dependentactivationofRab13wasinvolvedintheadhesiveinteractionbetweenTcellsandAPCsandinthesubsequentproductionofinterleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) by the activated T cells , we performed experiments with 3A9Tcells , whichhaveahenegglysozyme ( HEL ) – specific I - A k – restricted TCR , and I - A k – bearing CH27 B cells , which act as APCs ( 22 ) . 3A9 Tcells and CH27 APCsin - teract with each other in the presence of the HEL antigen and the T cells produce IL - 2 , and this process is dependent on LFA - 1 – ICAM - 1 interactions ( 22 ) . We transfected 3A9 T cells with plasmid en - coding GFP - tagged wild - type Rab13 and found that Rab13 accumulated at contact sites between the HEL - specific 3A9 T cells and HEL - loaded , but not unloaded , CH27 B cells ( Fig . 3E ) . Rab13 was distributed in a ring - shaped pattern at the contact site and colocalized with LFA - 1 at the peripheral su - pramolecular activation cluster ( pSMAC ) of the immunological synapse ( Fig . 3E ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that the Rab13 accumulated at contact sites containing LFA - 1 clusters in 63 % of the cell - cell con - jugates ( fig . S4 ) . Overexpression of Rab13 DN substantially reduced the numbers of conjugates formed between the transfected 3A9 cells and the APCs , and also resulted in decreased IL - 2 production ( Fig . 3F ) .

The cell surface abundance of LFA - 1 containing the a L D 1095 mutant was similar to that of wild - type LFA - 1 , and it colocalized with Rab13 in unstimulated cells ( Fig . 4A ) . How - ever , the LFA - 1 D 1095 mutant was not present with Rab13 at the leading edge in response to CXCL12 ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . As expected , the cells expressing the a L D 1095 mutant did not adhere to ICAM - 1 in response to CXCL12 ( Fig . 4B ) . The defective binding of the LFA - 1 D 1095 mutant with the RAPL - Mst1 complex impaired the association of LFA - 1 with Rab13 in response to CXCL12 ( Fig . 4C ) , suggesting that active Rab13 as - sociated with the cytoplasmic region of the a L subunit as well as with RAPL - Mst1 ( fig . S5A ) . Time - lapse images of BAF / LFA - 1 cells on a CXCL12 - coated surface demonstrated that wild - type LFA - 1 and Rab13 were cotranslocated to the membrane of the developing leading edge ( Fig . 4D , movies S1 to S3 , and fig . S5B ) . Rab13 accumulated at the front membrane , which was demar - cated from the cell body membrane by the absence of the LFA - 1 D 1095 mutant ( Fig . 4D and movies S4 to S6 ) . These data suggest that Rab13 ac - tively transports LFA - 1 to the leading edge of the growing membrane , a process that requires the association of the cytoplasmic tail of the a L subunit with RAPL - Mst1 . Although the LFA - 1 D 1095 mutant was absent from the front mem - brane , it colocalized with the accumulated Rab13 before it extended from the cell body ( Fig . 4E and movies S7 to S10 , 4 - s time point ) . When the Rab13 - enriched projection protruded from the accumulation sites , the LFA - 1 D 1095 mutant did not transfer to that projection during the 8 - to 16 - s time frame ( Fig . 4E and movies S7 to S10 ) . These data suggest that LFA - 1 clusters are formed at the same time as the developing Rab13 - enriched protrusion . Because formation of the protrusion depends on microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton , we examined the dynamics of microtubules and actin during LFA - 1 cluster formation . To visualize mi - crotubule cables , we transfected cells expressing LFA - 1 – mRFP with plas - mid encoding GFP - tagged EB3 ( EB3 - GFP ) , which labels the plus ends of growingmicrotubules . InresponsetoCXCL12 , BAF / LFA - 1cellsgenerated protruding membranes in which LFA - 1 was enriched ; however , the tips of the microtubules visualized by EB3 - GFP did not colocalize with the LFA - 1 – enriched protrusions ( fig . S6A ) . In contrast , when filamentous actin ( F - actin ) structures were visualized with Lifeact - mCherry ( 24 ) in cells expressing GFP – Rab13 wild - type , Rab13 moved to the front of the protrusion along F - actin , and F - actin structures were undetectable after Rab13 reached the leading edge ( Fig . 4F ) . Mst1 and Rab13 cooperate in F - actin – dependent vesicular transport VASP is an ENA / VASP family member , and it has an important role in the assembly of actin filaments . VASP contains a proline - rich sequence , which recruits the G - actin – binding protein profilin . Localization of VASP to the leading edge of a migrating cell leads to the local accumulation of profilin , whichinturnsuppliesactinmonomerstogrowingfilamentends ( 25 ) . Some studies reported that the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser 157 is important for thelocalizationofVASPtothecellperipheryandthe inductionofelongated protrusions and formation of the leading edge ( 26 , 27 ) . Because activation of the kinase Hippo ( Mst1 / 2 ) leads to the phosphorylation of Ena by Warts kinase ( Lats1 ) in Drosophila border cells , we examined the involvement of Mst1 - dependent phosphorylation of VASP in chemokine - dependent F - actin assembly . Asexpected , overexpressionofMst1increasedthephosphorylation of VASPatSer 157 comparedto thatin untransfected cells ( Fig . 5A ) . CXCL12 stimulated an increase in the phosphorylation of VASP at Ser 157 , whereas VASPphosphorylationwasdecreased in Mst1 KDcells ( Fig . 5B ) , suggesting that CXCL12 leads to the phosphorylation of VASP Ser 157 in an Mst1 - dependent manner . Consistent with previous findings ( 26 , 27 ) , we found that wild - type VASP accumulated at the tip of growing F - actin filaments or at the leading edge of cells stimulated with CXCL12 , whereas accumulation of the VASP S157Amutant was substantially reduced ( Fig . 5C and fig . S6B ) . LFA - 1 clustering occurred at the protrusion wherewild - type VASPaccumulated at the tip and along F - actin in CXCL12 - stimulated cells ( Fig . 5D and fig . S6C ) . TheoverexpressionoftheVASPS157Amutantsubstantiallyreducedthefor - mation of LFA - 1 clusters and the adhesion of cells to ICAM - 1 ( Fig . 5D ) . These data suggest that Mst1 promotes F - actin polymerization through the phosphorylation of VASP , which might be crucial for the Rab13 - dependent vesicular transport of LFA - 1 . Myosin Va was reported to mediate Rab GTPase – dependent vesicular transport ( 28 – 30 ) . Because the transcripts of the myosin Va gene undergo tissue - specific alternative splicing , we cloned a complementary DNA ( cDNA ) encoding myosin Va from lymphocytes , expressed it in COS cells , andexaminedtheassociationbetweenmyosinVaandRab13 . Wefoundthat myosin Va specifically bound to Rab13 - GTP ( Fig . 5E ) . In unstimulated cells , myosin Vawas present in the cytoplasm , where it partially colocalized with wild - type Rab13 near the Golgi ( fig . S7A ) . Upon stimulation of the BAF / LFA - 1 cells with CXCL12 , myosin Va moved and transiently coloca - lized with wild - type Rab13 and LFA - 1 at the leading edge ( fig . S7 , A and B ) . Overexpression of the head domain of myosin Va inhibited the clustering of LFA - 1 in CXCL12 - stimulated cells ( Fig . 5F ) and inhibited theLFA - 1 – andICAM - 1 – dependentmigrationandadhesionofBAF / LFA - 1cells ( Fig . 5F and fig . S7C ) . Rab13 is indispensable for lymphocyte trafficking Finally , we examined the activation and function of Rab13 in primary mouse T cells . We found that Rab13 was activated in T cells upon exposure to the CC chemokine CCL21 ( Fig . 6A ) . To generate Rab13 − / − mice , we used gene targeting to generate mice carrying floxed Rab13 alleles ( Rab13 f / f ) in which exon 1 containing the initiation codon was flanked with loxP sites . We then crossed this mice with CAG - Cre transgenic mice to de - lete exon 1 ubiquitously . Southern and Western blotting analysis confirmed that Rab13 protein was not detectable because of the deletion of exon 1 in Rab13 − / − T cells ( fig . S8A ) . Rab13 − / − mice were born with the expected Mendelian frequencies and grew normally . There was no difference in the ratio of naïve T cells between Rab13 f / f and Rab13 − / − mice at 6 to 8 weeks old ( fig . S8B ) . We examined whether a deficiency in Rab13 in primary lymphocytes affected the subcellular localization of Mst1 in response to chemokine . As previously described ( 6 ) , Mst1 translocated to the front membrane of Rab13 f / f T cells upon stimulation with CCL21 , whereas Mst1 did not trans - locate to the leading edge , but remained diffusely distributed in the cyto - plasm of Rab13 − / − T cells ( Fig . 6B ) . The abundance of CCR7 , the receptor for CCL21 , in T cells from Rab13 − / − mice was similar to that in T cells from Rab13 f / f mice ( fig . S8B ) . These results suggest that Rab13 is required for the chemokine - dependent redistribution of Mst1 in primary T cells . Next , we examined the effect of Rab13 deficiencyon LFA - 1 clustering . The abundance of LFA - 1 in Tand B cells from Rab13 − / − mice was similar to that in T and B cells from Rab13 f / f mice ( Fig . 6C ) . About 30 % of CCL21 - stimulated T cells from wild - type mice showed polarized morphologies with a leading edge and uropod , towhich LFA - 1 and CD44 were clustered , respectively ( Fig . 6D ) . However , in most CCL21 - treated Rab13 − / − T cells , the redistribution of LFA - 1 was impaired ( Fig . 6D ) . The ability of T cells to adhere to ICAM - 1 in response to CCL21 was substantially reduced by Rab13 deficiency ( Fig . 7A ) . The displacement and velocity of Rab13 − / − T cells during migration on ICAM - 1 in the presence of CCL21weredecreasedto43and58 % ofthoseincontrolTcells , respectively R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E www .

These data suggest that Rab13 is involved in the clustering of LFA - 1 and the efficient adhe - sion and migration of primary T cells in re - sponse to chemokine . Because impaired LFA - 1 clustering leads to a diminished lym - phocyte homing capability ( 8 , 9 ) , we next examined the effects of Rab13 deficiency on lymphocyte homing into the spleen and lymph nodes . For this purpose , we differen - tially labeled Rab13 f / f and Rab13 − / − T cells and injected them into normal mice . After 1 hour , the numbers of cells from both popu - lations were almost equally present in the blood , whereas the extent of trafficking of Rab13 − / − T cells into the spleen and peripherallymphnodeswasreducedtoabout50and30 % , respectively , of that of control cells ( Fig . 7C ) . Wealsoexaminedthetransfer of injected cells to the liver and lung , as pre - viously reported ( 31 ) , but there was no in - crease in the number of Rab13 − / − T cells ( fig . S8C ) , suggesting that exclusion from lymphoid tissues might affect cell survival . Because LFA - 1 is not involved in lympho - cyte homing to the spleen ( 32 ) , we analyzed the chemotaxis of Rab13 - deficient T cells to CCL21 in transwell migration assays . The numbers of Rab13 − / − T cells that were at - tracted by CCL21 and migrated through the uncoated transwell filter were substantially reduced compared with those of Rab13 f / f cells ( fig . S8D ) . On the other hand , the numbers of Rab13 f / f T cells that transmi - grated through ICAM - 1 – coated transwell filters were diminished compared to the numbers of cells that migrated through un - coated filter , which was due to adhesion to ICAM - 1 , whereas there was no corre - sponding decrease in the numbers of migrat - ing Rab13 − / − cells ( fig . S8D ) . These data suggest that Rab13 deficiency affects not onlytheLFA - 1 – dependentadhesiveactivity of cells but also their chemotaxis . Because of the defective homing ability ofRab13 - deficientcells , Rab13 − / − micehad smaller lymphoid tissues , such as spleens and lymph nodes , than did wild - type mice ( Fig . 7D ) . Immunohistological analysis showed decreases in the sizes and cellular densities of B cell follicles and T cell areas ofthesecondarylymphoidtissuesofRab13 − / − mice , although the architecture of the lym - phoid tissues , including the segregation of T cells and B cells , appeared to be normal ( Fig . 7D ) .

These data suggest that Rab13 plays indispensable roles in lymphocyte trafficking . DISCUSSION Here , we first demonstrated a substantial link between Mst1 and Rab13 . The Rab13 - dependent clustering of LFA - 1 generates adhesion sites on ICAM - 1atthe front mem - brane , which leads to high - speed migration by lymphocytes . Rab13 - deficient mice dem - onstrated hypoplastic lymphoid tissues caused by the impaired trafficking capacity of lymphocytes ; however , the digestive and sexorgansinthesemicewereratherenlarged , as was described for mice deficient in Mst1 and Mst2 ( 7 ) , confirming a previously un - characterized connection between Rab13 and Mst1 in vivo . Loss of Mst1 impaired the activation of Rab13 and the extension of projections from the cell body in lymphocytes . The kinase activity of Mst1 is required for LFA - 1 clustering at the leading edge of cells ( 6 ) . Mst1 not only associates with the cyto - plasmic tail of the a L subunit and mediates Rab13 - dependent LFA - 1 transport but also activates Rab13 and promotes the develop - ment of F - actin filaments in response to chemokinebycontrollingthephosphorylationofDENND1CandVASP ( fig . S9 ) . A study reported that NDR1 / 2 ( nuclear Dbf2 - related 1 / 2 ) , downstream effectors of Mst1 , phos - phorylates Rabin8 , a GEF for Rab8 , and activates Rab8 , which is critical for cilio - genesis ( 33 ) and dendritic spine develop - ment ( 34 ) . DENND1C does not have any motifs that are targeted by NDR family ki - nases ; thus , it might be a direct substrate of Mst1 . Thus , our findings suggest that Rab13 is a key signaling effector of Mst1 that facilitates the migration and adhesion of lymphocytes ; however , we cannot ex - clude the possibility that other Rab family GTPases could also be involved in this function . Although internalization and recycling play an important role in cell migration through integrins ( 18 , 19 , 35 – 37 ) , our pre - vious reports demonstrated that the Rap1 - RAPL - Mst1 signaling pathway does not affect Rab5 - and Rab11 - dependent en - docytosis or LFA - 1 recycling ( 6 , 38 ) . LFA - 1 clustering at the leading edge de - pends on the cytoplasmic tail of the a L sub - unit , but not on b 2 , and LFA - 1 clusters do not colocalize with Rab4 , Rab5 , or Rab11 ( 6 , 38 ) .

Rap2 colocalizes with the TfR , which is consistent with the other reports linking intracellular integrins to recycling vesicles that express the TfR ( 39 ) . However , RAPL and Mst1 colocalize with vesicular compartments distinct from those containing TfR ( 38 ) .

Once the cells adhered to ICAM - 1 through LFA - 1 clusters , they often moved , keeping a similar adhesion point . We speculate that Rab13 - dependent LFA - 1clusters thatform at the frontmembrane might beessen - tial for the generation of a new attachment point , which supports skipping movements and a rapid change in directionality , and that Rap2 - dependent LFA - 1 endocytosis and recycling is necessary for static movement after attachment . WeshowedthatRab13colocalizedwithanLFA - 1 – containing ringatthe immunological synapse , and that inhibiting Rab13 impaired the formation of the immunological synapse between T cells and APCs , indicating that Rab13 likely plays an indispensable role in distributing LFA - 1 at these con - tact sites . T cells recognize as fewas 10 activating peptide - bound major his - tocompatibility complexes ( pMHCs ) among about 1 million self - pMHC moleculesonthesurfaceofAPCs ( 40 ) .

Our results suggest that Rab13 - dependent vesicular transport is involvedin the formation of LFA - 1 rings and T cell activation when T cells interact with APCs . Naïvelymphocytesrecirculatecontinually betweenperipherallymphoid tissues through the blood and lymphatic systems for the purpose of immu - nosurveillance . Recirculating naïve lymphocytes enter across the high en - dothelial venule ( HEV ) into lymphoid tissues by means of specialized interactions with capillaries . Chemokine - dependent activation of LFA - 1 in lymphocytes is crucial for firm adhesion of the cells to ICAM - 1 on the HEVand subsequent transmigration into the tissues . We found that im - paired LFA - 1 activation in Rab13 - deficient lymphocytes was one of the main causes of the reduced lymph node sizes observed in Rab13 − / − mice , but we could not exclude the possibility that these findings may be in part a result of defects in stromal cells . Lymphocytes are the most dynamic cells in the body in terms of their motility , and they can migrate rapidly within secondary lymphoid organs in search of cognate antigens that are presented by dendritic cells , and in the extravascular inflamed interstitial tissues . The cooperative association of Mst1 with Rab13 coupled the clustering of LFA - 1 with the development of cell protrusions that might facilitate the generation of attachment sites in the direction of cell migration . This adhesion machinery acts as a driving force to enable the high - velocity movement of lymphocytes and promote lymphocytetraffickinginvivo . Elucidatingtherolesoftheactivemovement of lymphocytes in vivo with Rab13 - deficient mice has shed light on the adhesion - dependent mechanisms that regulate immune surveillance and immune responses .
