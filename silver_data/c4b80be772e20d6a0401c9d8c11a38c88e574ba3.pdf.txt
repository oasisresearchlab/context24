In dry , low - relative - humidity environments , these materials stiffen as they de - swell with water . Here , we use semi - dilute polymer theory to develop a simple power - law relationship between hydrogel elastic modulus and swelling . From this relationship , we predict hydrogel stiffness or swelling at arbitrary relative humidities . Our close predictions of properties of hydrogels across three different polymer mesh families at varying crosslinking densities and relative humidities demonstrate the validity and generality of our understanding . This predictive capability enables more rapid material discovery and selection for hydrogel applications in varying humidity environments . 1 Introduction Hydrogels , which are polymer networks that absorb water , have attracted increased attention in recent decades due to their distinct water - holding behavior . They have been shown to be beneﬁcial for a variety of applications from horticulture [ 1 – 4 ] to soft robotics or tissue engineering [ 5 – 9 ] . Hydrogels used for soft robotics and actuation rely on the inherent changes in mechanical stiffness that result from changes in the amount of water in the hydrogel . This relationship is observed in everyday foods such as rice or pasta—which can be described as starch - based hydrogels—wherein softness increases with water content . In the past three decades , there has been a large body of research focusing on either the swelling behavior [ 1 , 10 – 16 ] or the mechanical stiffness [ 5 , 6 , 9 , 17 – 24 , 24 – 31 ] . One notable example is the study by Li et al . , which used Flory - Huggins theory to develop an equation of state that could be used to relate swelling to osmotic pressure [ 32 ] . In particular , they found that osmotic pressure was independent ∗ https : / / dattalab . princeton . edu / † https : / / dakine . sites . unlv . edu / a r X i v : 2 109 . 13316v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 2 7 S e p 2021 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT of crosslinking density , indicating that gels composed of the same base monomer can be treated similarly . Their work , and the collective work of others , demonstrates a strong fundamental understanding of hydrogel swelling and stiffness behavior in conditions close to a fully swollen state ; however , we have a less - developed understanding of how swelling and stiffness depend on humidity . Hydrogel studies on stiffness often limit analysis to the fully wet state [ 23 – 25 , 33 – 36 ] . Water swelling in hydrogels is also controlled by the relative humidity in the ambient environment . This humidity - induced swelling is particularly important for food preservation and preparation [ 37 ] . Recent works in atmospheric water harvesting have relied on hygroscopic sorbents—including gels [ 38 – 40 ] —that absorb water at different humidities [ 41 ] . The moisture sorption isotherm quantiﬁes how much water these materials can absorb—or swell in the case of gels . As humidity increases , hydrogels should swell and soften ; however , the exact dependence on humidity remains an open question . Here , we present simple scaling laws based on semi - dilute polymer theory that ( 1 ) describe the dependence of stiffness on swelling and ( 2 ) dependence of stiffness and swelling on relative humidity . Using these scaling laws , we present a method to predict moisture sorption isotherms from limited stiffness and sorption data from a similar reference hydrogel . 2 Results Starting from semi - dilute polymer theory , we develop a scaling law relationship between mechanical bulk modulus and swelling fraction . We then relate this dependency to changes in osmotic pressure and relative humidity . 2 . 1 Dependence of stiffness on swelling To develop a direct relationship between elastic modulus and swelling , we use de Gennes’ semi - dilute description of polymer solutions [ 42 ] . The utility of de Gennes’ semi - dilute description is such that many properties of polymer solutions can be quantiﬁed using simple power - law relationships . In accordance with numerous studies [ 43 – 45 ] , we assume the hydrogel can be thought of as a semi - dilute solution where the monomer concentration , c , is slightly higher than the overlap concentration , c ∗ . At this semi - dilute state , polymer “blobs” are entangled with each other , creating an expansive polymer mesh . This polymer mesh is characterized by an average spacing between polymer chains termed the correlation length , ξ . de Gennes determined that the correlation length is ξ = a 7 / 4 v − 1 / 4 φ − 3 / 4 poly ( 1 ) where a is the monomer size , v is the excluded volume of the monomer . φ poly is the volume fraction of polymer deﬁned as φ poly ≡ V poly / V where V is the volume of the material including solvent and V poly is the volume of polymer exlucing solvent . The afﬁnity between monomer and solvent is captured by the excluded volume term as it is related to the Flory - Huggins interaction parameter , χ , such that v = a 3 ( 1 − 2 χ ) . The osmotic pressure describes the state of swelling in a polymer solution and is directly related to the volume fraction of the polymer , φ poly , where higher φ poly results in higher osmotic pressures . As such , hydrogels that are more swollen ( low φ poly ) have lower osmotic pressures . de Gennes showed that the osmotic pressure , Π , is related to the correlation length such that Π = CkT / ξ 3 , where C is a dimensionless constant on the order of unity and kT is the product of the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature . Applying Eq . 1 to this relation , the osmotic pressure can be expressed as a scaling law with φ poly such that Π = CkTa − 21 / 4 v 3 / 4 φ 9 / 4 poly . ( 2 ) If we take a gel and compress or expand it , we are changing its volume , V , without changing the number of monomers . Assuming that a hydrogel can be considered a poroelastic system [ 46 ] , the elastic modulus of interest is the drained bulk modulus since it allows solvent to drain in and out freely while the polymer structure is compressed or expanded . We denote this modulus as K , which is deﬁned as K ≡ − V ∂P ext / ∂V where P ext is the external pressure applied on the body . At chemical and mechanical equilibrium , the external pressure can be related to the osmotic pressure such that P ext = P 0 + Π where P 0 is the ambient pressure , assumed to be a constant . Thus , K = − V ∂ ( P 0 + Π ) ∂V = − V ∂ Π ∂V ( 3 ) indicating that the elastic modulus of a polymer solution is related to changes in osmotic pressure . Applying de Gennes’ power - law expression of osmotic pressure ( Eq . 2 ) in this deﬁnition of modulus , K ∼ kTa − 21 / 4 v 3 / 4 φ 9 / 4 poly . ( 4 ) This result shows that the stiffness of a hydrogel scales with the volume fraction of polymer to the 9 / 4 power . Therefore , from the wet ( fully swollen ) to drier states , the volume fraction of polymer , φ poly , increases , and the hydrogel stiffens as 2 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT a result as long as the semi - dilute description holds . Eq . 4 allows for determination of K from measurable quantities T , a , v and φ poly . However , determining these quantities involves many separate , time - consuming experimental procedures . It is considerably more convenient to deal with a scaling law that depends on a reference state that can be readily characterized with fewer experiments . Therefore , we develop a reduced scaling law for stiffness using a reference wet - state modulus K wet . At this reference wet state , the hydrogel is swollen and in equilibrium with pure water or , equivalently , 100 % humidity . We can deﬁne a swelling fraction as s ≡ V / V wet where V wet is the volume of the gel at the wet state and V is the volume at an arbitrary state of swelling , i . e . , equilibrated at an arbitrary relative humidity . Note that the swelling fraction has a maximum value of unity since at the maximum swelling , V = V wet . Conversely , at the driest possible state , V = V poly and , therefore , s = V poly / V wet < 1 . Thus , the range of swelling fraction is V poly / V wet ≤ s ≤ 1 . While there are related quantities to the swelling fraction—e . g . , the swelling ratio J ≡ V / V poly [ 32 ] and the degree of swelling Φ ≡ V wet / V [ 47 , 48 ] —the swelling fraction more intuitively describes the fractional content of water based off of a reference wet state at 100 % humidity . Taking the deﬁnition of polymer volume fraction , φ poly ≡ V poly / V , and eliminating V using the deﬁnition of swelling fraction , we obtain φ poly = V poly V wet s . Substituting this expression for φ poly into Eq . 4 , we ﬁnd that K ∼ kTa − 21 / 4 v 3 / 4 ( V wet V poly s ) − 9 / 4 . Finally , using the ratio of moduli at the arbitrary and wet swelling states , K / K wet , the constant factor of kTa − 21 / 4 v 3 / 4 cancels out and a reduced modulus can be related to the swelling fraction as K K wet = (cid:0) V wet V (cid:1) 9 / 4 (cid:16) V wet V wet (cid:17) 9 / 4 = (cid:18) V wet V (cid:19) 9 / 4 = s − 9 / 4 . ( 5 ) Thus , as a gel de - swells ( decreasing s ) , the modulus sharply increases due to the collapse of the polymer network as illustrated in Fig . 1a . To verify this relationship between swelling and stiffness ( Eq . 5 ) , we perform mechanical indentation tests to measure the elastic modulus at various states of swelling ( see Materials and Methods ) —a veriﬁed mechanical characterization technique for soft gels [ 45 ] . By indenting a sample with a spherical indenter and measuring its force - displacement response , we apply Hertzian contact mechanics [ 49 ] to determine the elastic modulus ( see Materials and Methods ) . We set the timescales of our measurements to ensure that we measure the drained bulk modulus . Our results do not depend on displacement speed ( in our range of testing ) , indicating that the material behaves quasi - statically and quasi - elastically , away from any dynamic drainage or viscoelastic effects . We use N , N’ - methylene ( bis ) acrylamide ( MBA ) - crosslinked PAAm hydrogels at different crosslinking ratios ( 1 % , 1 . 5 % , 2 % , 2 . 5 % , and 3 % ( mol MBA ) / ( mol PAAm ) % ) . We achieve different states of swelling by hydrating and dehydrating samples at different relative humidities ; the wet state is achieved by equilibrating samples in water . In accordance with other work [ 14 , 50 , 51 ] , we assume similar densities between polymer and water and a relatively larger amount of water compared to polymer such that s can be determined from a ratio of weights s ’ m / m wet . We ﬁnd that across approximately one decade of swelling fraction , the measured elastic modulus closely followed the − 9 / 4 scaling law as predicted by Eq . 5 for all crosslinking densities tested , as shown in Fig . 1b . This close agreement is consistent with previous studies [ 30 , 52 , 53 ] and veriﬁes our two assumptions that ( 1 ) the hydrogel network can be represented as a semi - dilute polymer solution and ( 2 ) the hydrogel network is a mechanical poroelastic system where the elastic ( drained bulk ) modulus is equivalent to the osmotic modulus regardless of crosslinking density . 2 . 2 Dependence of stiffness and swelling on relative humidity The relative humidity of the ambient environment sets the chemical potential of water vapor . A gel that is equilibrated with the ambient will have an internal chemical potential equivalent to the ambient set by the relative humidity : µ = µ wet + kT ln ( RH ) where the wet state corresponds to 100 % humidity and RH is the fractional relative humidity so kT ln ( RH ) ≤ 0 . We use the osmotic pressure as a mediating variable to understand the dependence of stiffness and swelling on relative humidity . Since osmotic pressure is a volumetric form of chemical potential where Π ≈ µ 0 − µ v w ( µ 0 being the chemical potential of pure solvent and v w being an effective molecular volume that depends on polymer type ) , it also varies with relative humidity : Π ≈ µ 0 − µ wet − kT ln ( RH ) v w ( 6 ) such that osmotic pressure increases with decreasing relative humidity . Conversely , as relative humidity increases , the osmotic pressure decreases , and the gel swells . To understand this from the quantity of swelling fraction , according to Eq . 2 and the relationship between φ poly and s , the scaling relationship between osmotic pressure and swelling fraction is Π ∝ s − 9 / 4 . The relationship between s and RH is the moisture sorption isotherm as it quantiﬁes the amount of 3 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT water absorbed as a function of humidity . As shown in Fig . 2a , the moisture sorption isotherm can be experimentally determined for any gel using mass measurements of samples equilibrated to arbitrary relative humidities . When RH < 1 and gels de - swell from their wet state , s decreases , and the osmotic pressure experiences a change of ∆Π ≡ Π − Π wet . Using Eq . 6 , we can quantify changes in osmotic pressure with relative humidity as ∆Π ≈ − kT ln ( RH ) / v w . ( 7 ) We can also quantify ∆Π in terms of s and the mechanical stiffness at the wet state , K wet . To do so , we apply the deﬁnition of modulus , K ( Eq . 3 ) , into our reduced scaling law ( Eq . 5 ) and obtain − V ∂ Π ∂V K wet = ( VV wet ) − 94 . Integrating both sides from the wet state to an arbitrary swelling state − 1 K wet R Π Π wet ∂ Π 0 = R V V wet 1 V 0 ( V 0 V wet ) − 94 ∂V 0 , we ﬁnd that the change in osmotic pressure from the wet state , ∆Π ≡ Π − Π wet is ∆Π = 4 9 K wet ( s − 9 / 4 − 1 ) . ( 8 ) From this relationship , we observe that ∆Π can be calculated from a mechanical measurement at the wet state and the swelling fraction at any abitrary swelling state at particular RH . Plotting this calculated ∆Π with RH we observe that ∆Π increases with decreasing RH as shown in Fig . 2b . Alternatively , from Eq . 7 , ∆Π only depends on RH and the effective molecular volume , v w . Thus , we expect that hydrogels of similar v w should experience similar changes in osmotic pressure . 2 . 3 Equivalence of osmotic pressure differences across similar hydrogels Motivated by Li et al . ’s determination that hydrogels of the same polymer composition have the same osmotic pressures , independent of crosslinking density [ 32 ] , we expect that similar hydrogels that differ only by crosslinking density have similar v w . Therefore , from Eq . 7 , gels differing only by crosslinking experience the same changes in osmotic pressure , ∆Π , when exposed to the same relative humidities . Indeed , the results shown in Fig . 2b conﬁrm that the ∆Π values are independent of crosslinking density within uncertainty ( red data points for pure PAAm hydrogels ) . To further conﬁrm this , we tested two other polymer meshes , each at different crosslinking densities : PAAm with the addition of N , N - Dimethylacrylamide ( DMA ) [ 54 ] ; and PAAm post - treated with hydrolysis using sodium hydroxide [ 1 ] . Like pure PAAm , both PAAm + DMA ( blue ) and hydrolyzed PAAm ( green ) samples achieved the same ∆Π at the same humidities , independent of crosslinking density . FTIR spectra ( Fig . S4 ) for each hydrogel indicate three different hydrogel polymer mesh families and independence with crosslinking density , corroborating our ﬁndings . 2 . 4 Predicting moisture sorption isotherms of similar hydrogels From the equivalence in ∆Π across different crosslinking densities , we can conﬁrm that ∆Π ( RH ) A = ∆Π ( RH ) B ( 9 ) for any two samples ( sample A and sample B ) of the same polymer mesh and relative humiditiy . Setting two ∆Π expressions equal to each other using Eq . 8 for two similar hydrogels with different crosslinkings enables one to predict unknown properties of one of the hydrogels . For instance , we can predict the moisture sorption isotherm—water weight fraction , w . f . ’ s , versus RH for sample B as long as we know the moisture sorption isotherm of a reference hydrogel A , the reference wet - state stiffness , K wet , A , and the wet - state stiffness of hydrogel B , K wet , B . Furthermore , using the scaling law for modulus and swelling fraction ( Eq . 5 ) , we can calculate stiffness of hydrogel B at any relative humidity . Thus , one only needs to study a speciﬁc reference hydrogel in detail to understand the humidity - dependent swelling and stiffness of an entire family of hydrogels . Using a pure PAAm hydrogel at 1 % crosslinking as a reference ( sample A ) where we know s A at any relative humidity and its K wet , A , we demonstrate the procedure to predict the sorption isotherm of a related hydrogel : pure PAAm hydrogel at 3 % crosslinking ( sample B ) . We start by setting the two ∆Π terms equal to each other ( Eq . 9 ) and expressing them in terms of their respective K wet and s ( Eq . 8 ) . Given a known reference sample swelling fraction , s A , at a particular humidity , we need to determine the unknown s B at the same humidity . By performing a single mechanical test to determine K wet , B = 16 . 7 kPa and applying the known K wet , A = 8 . 5 kPa , we can use the equivalence of ∆Π to determine the single unknown s B : 4 9 K wet , A | { z } known   s A | { z } known − 9 / 4 − 1   = 4 9 K wet , B | { z } known   s B | { z } unknown − 9 / 4 − 1   ( 10 ) 4 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT This procedure works to determine the swelling fraction s B at a particular RH . Repeating this procedure for any RH , we can determine the entire moisture sorption isotherm for sample B as shown by the green curve in Fig . 3 . For this particular case , the predicted sorption isotherm for B is in close agreement with an experimentally determined sorption isotherm ( Fig . 3 , green dots ) . Furthermore , the moisture sorption isotherm for any hydrogel similar to A with arbitrary wet - state stiffness , K wet , can be determined ( black curves in Fig . 3 ) . The equivalence of ∆Π across similar hydrogels can also be used to determine stiffness at any arbitrary relative humidity . If s B is known at a particular humidity below 100 % and K wet , B is unknown , then we can use Eq . 10 to determine K wet , B . Having determined K wet , B , Eq . 10 can subsequently be used to determine s B at any relative humidity with A as a reference . Having obtained s B as a function of humidity , we can then apply the stiffness – swelling law , Eq . 5 , to determine K B at any arbitrary humidity . To verify our prediction approach , we perform 120 independent weight fraction predictions for nine different hydrogels from three families , each at ﬁve different humidities ( full results in Fig . S1 ) . For each prediction at a particular humidity , we use different samples as references . For example , to predict the weight fraction of pure – 2 . 5 % at 50 % RH , we use pure PAAm at 1 % , 1 . 5 % , 2 % , and 3 % , all at 50 % RH , as references , representing four independent predictions for pure – 2 . 5 % at 50 % RH . These multiple predictions are possible by performing moisture sorption experiments across a range of humidities for every sample . This dataset also serves as a means to verify our predictions . Comparing our predictions and actual measurements of weight fraction , we ﬁnd close agreement as shown in Fig . 4a . In Fig . 4b , we compare our predictions to experimentally measured weight fraction values and ﬁnd that they are accurate to within ± 20 % . In fact , more than 70 % of the samples were accurate to within ± 10 % . The remarkably close agreement across a wide range of hydrogels provides strong validation of ( 1 ) the assumption that osmotic pressure changes are equivalent for similar hydrogels at the same humidities and ( 2 ) the scaling law relationship between stiffness and swelling derived from semi - dilute polymer theory . 3 Conclusions Our work shows that semi - dilute polymer theory can be applied to develop a simple power - law relationship between swelling and stiffness . We also elucidate how swelling and stiffness depend on relative humidity using the concept of osmotic pressure . We ﬁnd that changes in osmotic pressure due to humidity changes are equivalent across similar hydrogels , indpendent of crosslinking . Combining the stiffness – swelling power law with the the principle equivalent changes in osmotic pressure , we demonstrate procedures to predict swelling or stiffness at any relative humidity for any arbitrary hydrogel of similar polymer network . With our prediction procedures , one only needs to study a speciﬁc reference hydrogel in detail to understand the humidity - dependent swelling and stiffness of any related hydrogels within the same family . We deﬁne hydrogel similarity using the effective molecular volume , v w , which relates osmotic pressure to chemical potential . Further investigation of the molecular interactions that affect v w could add to the predictive power of our approach and inform how we could classify hydrogel families . The simplicity of our resulting equations provides substantial utility for gel synthesis design . We anticipate that our work will guide hydrogel applications such as agriculture and soft robotics that depend on the inherent relationship between swelling and stiffness , operating at different humidities . 4 Materials and methods 4 . 1 Preparation of hydrogels All hydrogels were prepared from aqueous stock solutions of the following chemicals : N , N’ - methylene ( bis ) acrylamide ( MBA ) , N , N - Dimethylacrylamide ( DMA ) , ammonium persulfate ( APS ) , and tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) at concentrations of 0 . 127 g / 10 mL , 2 . 6 mL / 10 mL , 0 . 08 g / 10 mL and 0 . 25 mL / 10 mL , respectively . The base acrylamide ( AAm ) monomer was used in its pure powder form . By mixing different amounts of these chemicals , polymers were spontaneously synthesized . During this process , APS served as an initiator , TEMED as an accelerator , and MBA as a crosslinker . In all hydrogels , we started with 0 . 25 g of AAm monomer , 0 . 5 mL of TEMED solution and 0 . 5 mL of APS solution . Then , we mixed varying amounts of MBA solution in order to achieve the target crosslinker ratios ( moles of MBA over moles of AAm ) ranging from 1 % to 3 % . To ensure that polymerization occurred in a consistently dilute environment for all hydrogels , we added DI water to ensure that the mole fraction of water over other chemicals was 1000 . For hydrogels with DMA , 20 % ( DMA / AAm mol / mol ) was added . Then , the solution was vortex mixed for approximately one minute and subsequently rested at room temperature ( 24 ° C ) for 24 hours . For samples that were hydrolyzed , we immersed the samples in 1 mol L − 1 sodium hydroxide for 30 minutes before . Finally , the samples were ﬂushed in DI water for one week to remove unreacted chemicals and equilibrate them to the wet state . 5 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT The samples are named by their method of treatment and crosslinker ratio . For example , the pure PAAm hydrogel with 1 % crosslinker ratio is named Pure - 1 % ; the DMA - modiﬁed hydrogel with 2 % crosslinker ratio is named DMA - 2 % ; the hydrolyzed hydrogel with 3 % crosslinker ratio is named Hydro - 3 % . 4 . 2 Indentation testing We measured the mechanical bulk modulus of hydrogels using an indentation testing method as performed and validated by others [ 45 , 55 – 57 ] . By indenting a soft sample with a spherical indenter and measuring its force - displacement response , we can apply Hertzian contact mechanics [ 49 ] to determine an elastic modulus . We used a custom - built indentation tester to perform these measurements ( Fig . S2 ) . Samples were prepared in a cylindrical shape and oriented such that a ﬂat surface was indented . All tests are completed within 15 minutes after removing the samples from the humidity - controlled chamber to ensure minimal weight loss from de - swelling to the ambient environment . Displacement speeds ranged from 6 mm min − 1 to 10 mm min − 1 ; slower or faster speeds did not affect the force - displacement curves , indicating the sample behaved quasi - statically and quasi - elastically , away from dynamic drainage and viscoelastic effects . The loading force , F , is proportional to the displacement of the ball bearing , d , raised to the power of 3 / 2 : F = 4 3 E ∗ R 12 d 32 ( 11 ) where R is the radius of the ball bearing in the setup and E ∗ is an effective modulus . E ∗ is related to the Young’s moduli , E , and Poisson’s ratios , ν , of the sample and indenter such that 1 E ∗ = 1 − ν 2 indenter E indenter + 1 − ν 2 sample E sample . ( 12 ) The Poisson’s ratio for all hydrogels , ν sample was assumed to be 1 / 3 as measured previously by others for crosslinked hydrogels [ 28 , 58 , 59 ] . Therefore , the bulk modulus is equivalent to the Young’s modulus : K sample = E sample . Each sample was tested ﬁve times and the the force - displacement data was ﬁt to Eq . 11 , allowing us to determine E sample and its associated uncertainty in ﬁtting . We identiﬁed two primary sources of uncertainty . The ﬁrst being the standard deviation from ﬁve separate measurements , σ . The second being the average uncertainty from ﬁtting e = pP e i 2 / N where e i is a ﬁtting uncertainty from a particular measurement and N is the number of measurements . Thus , the total uncertainty in elastic modulus is √ σ 2 + e 2 , which can be visualized by the error bars in Fig . 1 . 4 . 3 Humidity control To achieve stable relative humidities below 100 % , we used a microﬂuidic controller ( Elveﬂow ) to mix dry and humid air ﬂows ( Fig . S3 ) . The dry air source was supplied by laboratory air supply at 7 % RH while the humid air source was bubbled through DI water and achieved a humidity of around 99 % . A custom - built PID control software was implemented to achieve humidity values of 10 % , 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % . 4 . 4 FTIR Results Fourier - transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy ( Shimadzu , IRSpirit , QATR - S ) was used to verify that three different hydrogel polymer families ( Pure , DMA , and Hydro ) were synthesized . Within each family , FTIR spectra did not signiﬁcantly change with crosslinker ratio . FTIR results are shown in Fig . S4 . Conﬂicts of interest There are no conﬂicts to declare .

( a ) As a hydrogel de - swells , the crosslinked polymer mesh densiﬁes and stiffens . In ( a ) , we show swelling and stiffness data for 1 % crosslinked pure PAAm . ( b ) Across a range of crosslinkings from 1 % to 3 % , we found that stiffness depends on the − 9 / 4 power with swelling fraction . ( b , inset ) The stiffness , as quantiﬁed by the bulk modulus , is determined using contact mechanics and force - displacement data from indentation tests . When moduli are normalized by their reference wet - state value , K wet , all stiffness and swelling fraction data collapse onto a single curve according to Eq . 5 . Error bars represent uncertainties in repeatability and curve ﬁtting ( see Materials and Methods ) . 10 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT Figure 2 : Lowering relative humidity , ( a ) de - swells hydrogels as quantiﬁed by the moisture sorption isotherm and ( b ) increases osmotic pressure . Hydrogel samples were equilibrated at different relative humidities ranging from 10 % to 90 % . In ( b ) , we use swelling fraction and wet - state stiffness to calculate ∆Π = 49 K wet ( s − 9 / 4 − 1 ) ( Eq . 8 ) . We show only samples with crosslinking ratios of 1 % and 3 % , representing the entire range of crosslinking , for clarity . Error bars in weight fraction represent measurement and repeatability uncertainties . Error bars in ∆Π represent propagation errors in Eq . 8 originating from uncertainties in weight fraction and K wet . Figure 3 : Using a known moisture sorption isotherm for a reference hydrogel ( pure PAAm 1 % , red ) with known wet - state stiffness , we can predict moisture sorption isotherms ( black ) of similar hydrogels with any arbitrary wet - state stiffness , K wet , using Eq . 8 and 9 . There is close agreement between our prediction and an experimentally obtained moisture sorption isotherm for a similar hydrogel with K wet = 16 . 7 kPa ( pure PAAm 3 % , green ) . Error bars in weight fraction represent measurement and repeatability uncertainties . 11 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT Figure 4 : ( a ) The close agreement between predictions of moisture sorption isotherms across three different hydrogel families ( pure PAAm , PAAm + DMA , hydrolyzed PAAm ) veriﬁes our scaling laws and prediction scheme . We show only data for 1 % crosslinker ratio samples for clarity . We further verify the accuracy of our approach with ( b ) over 120 separate veriﬁcations of hydrogel samples across these three families at all crosslinker ratios ( 1 % , 1 . 5 % , 2 % , 2 . 5 % , and 3 % ) and humidities ( 10 % , 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , and 90 % ) where we found close agreement between predictions and measurements of weight fraction within ± 20 % . Error bars in actual weight fraction represent measurement and repeatability uncertainties . Error bars in predicted weight farctions represent propagation errors in Eq . 10 originating from uncertainties in weight fraction and K wet . 12 Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiffness in hydrogels A P REPRINT Figure 5 : Scheme of indentation test based on contact machanics 13 Supplementary Information for ”Scaling laws to predict humidity - induced swelling and stiﬀness in hydrogels” September 29 , 2021 1 Chemicals The chemicals used in the preparation of hydrogels are listed below : Acrylamide ( AAm ) N , N’ - Methylenebis ( acrylamide ) ( MBA ) Ammonium Persulfate ( APS ) N , N , N’ , N’ - teramethylethane - 1 , 2 - dimine ( TEMED ) N , N - Dimethylacrylamide ( DMA ) All chemicals used in this paper are purchasd from Sigma - Aldrich Co . 2 Figures Figure S1 : Indentation testing setup 1 a r X i v : 2 1 09 . 13316v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 27 S e p 2021 Figure S2 : Humidity - controlled chamber setup 2 Figure S3 : FTIR spectra indicate three diﬀerent hydrogel polymer mesh families . 3 Figure S4 : All prediction data ( Pure PAAm Hydrogel ) compared with actual data shows close agreement .
