Weaver In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy August 2016 Purdue University West Lafayette , Indiana ii ii “For me , it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion , however satisfying and reassuring . ” - Carl Sagan , The Demon - Haunted World : Science as a Candle in the Dark iii iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My project would not have been possible without tremendous support from many people . I first would like to acknowledge my graduate mentor , Dr . Daniel M . Suter . His support and guidance are irreplaceable . He pushed me to be a better scientist , mentor and communicator , and gave me the confidence to pursue a unique research path . I am very grateful and those lessons will remain with me throughout my life . I have also benefited from an excellent advisory committee . Dr . Yuk Fai Leung , my committee chair , graciously provided space in the animal facility to conduct the zebrafish work . Dr . Chris Staiger , Dr . Joseph Ogas and Dr . Paul Collodi provided critical discussion and poignant criticism to advance the quality of my research . I appreciate that each committee member was dedicated to my professional advancement and this was evident in their continued push for excellence in experimental quality and scientific communication . I would also like to thank all of the labs involved in the care and maintenance of the fish facility , but especially Deborah Biesemeier for her tireless effort to keep the facility in excellent condition . Without the dedication of all involved , my project and so many others would be impossible . I have had the privilege of being a teaching assistant for several courses during my time at Purdue . My teaching experience deepened my scientific knowledge , improved iv i v my communication and gave me the confidence to pursue a career in science . I would specifically like to thank Dr . Peter Hollenbeck , Dr . John Anderson , Dr . Susan Karcher , Dr . Laurie Iten , Dr . Clark Gedney and Deborah Anderson for giving me the opportunity to teach in their courses . I would like to extend my gratitude to former lab members Dr . Vidhya Munnamalai and Dr . Yingpei He for their mentoring and support . I would also like to thank our current post - doc and graduate students Dr . Ahmad Athammneh , Yuan Ren , Haley Roeder and Aslihan Terzi . It has been a privilege to be a part of such an insightful and talented group . Finally , none of this work would have been possible without the overwhelming support of my family . I especially want to extend my deepest gratitude to my wife . Her unwavering encouragement and confidence inspired me regardless of the circumstance . I admire you more than you know . It is a profound failure of language that all I can say is thank you . To my daughter , your intelligence and curiosity leave nothing out of your reach . I am proud of the person you are and excited to see the person you will become . v v TABLE OF CONTENTS Page LIST OF TABLES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . x LIST OF FIGURES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xi LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xiii ABSTRACT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . xvii CHAPTER 1 .

Ph . D . , Purdue University , August 2016 . The Role of NADPH Oxidases in Neurite Outgrowth and Zebrafish Neurodevelopment . Major Professor : Daniel M . Suter . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases ( NOX ) are a family of enzymes that produce reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . The first NOX enzyme was discovered in leukocytes and associated with host defense in the immune system . Subsequent findings of ROS production in non - immune cells led to the identification of six additional NOX isoforms , and opened new avenues for research into NOX - mediated cellular functions . Since then , NOX - derived ROS have been found to be involved in a tremendous number of cell signaling pathways . Of particular interest is the well - established function of NOX - derived ROS in signaling pathways that drive cytoskeletal rearrangements and motility in several cell types . Our lab is interested in the highly motile neuronal growth cone that guides axonal growth during neurodevelopment and regeneration . Others have reported that inhibition of NOX enzymes during development causes a decrease in the size of some brain areas , and NOX deficiencies in humans are correlated with diminished cognitive function . Despite the fact that NOX activity is necessary for some cell motility in non - neuronal cells and a loss of NOX function during development has impacts on brain structure , it is still unclear what role NOX plays in xviii axonal growth and guidance or the establishment of connections in the central nervous system . In this series of studies , I investigated the function of NOX enzymes in neurite outgrowth and neurodevelopment using both in vitro and in vivo approaches . I report that NOX activity is necessary for the extension of neurites in culture . Inhibition NOX activity leads to a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , a decrease in retrograde flow and a loss of neurite outgrowth . Using embryonic zebrafish , I showed that four separate nox genes are expressed broadly throughout the central nervous system during the first two days of development . Functional studies in zebrafish revealed that NOX inhibition leads to expansion of the ganglion cell layer in the retina and decrease in the size of the optic nerve . Subsequent studies using a site - specific , RNA - guided mutagenesis approach ( CRISPR / Cas9 ) showed that optic nerve thinning resulted from developmental delays while ganglion cell expansion was a permanent defect caused by the mutation of a specific NOX isoform , NOX2 / CYBB . The targeting of optic nerve axons to the optic tectum of the midbrain was also disrupted in NOX2 / CYBB mutants . These results show that NOX activity is critical for neurite outgrowth in cultured cells in addition to retinal development and axon targeting in vivo . 1 CHAPTER 1 . INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 Reactive oxygen species as cellular signals Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are a class of small , oxygen - containing compounds that readily react with many classes of biomolecules ( Finkel , 2001 ) . Typically , ROS are associated with the oxidation of free thiol groups in cysteine or methionine residues ( Fomenko et al . , 2007 ; Jones and Go , 2011 ) . Oxidized residues can readily form inter - or intramolecular disulfide bridges that effect protein structure and function ( Dalle - Donne et al . , 2002 ; Comito et al . , 2011 ) . Being promiscuous , ROS do not discern among targets in the same way as a prototypical ligand . Therefore , oxidation by ROS must be controlled by other means . One mechanism for controlling oxidation sites is the creation of reactive cysteines . Under normal physiological conditions , free cysteine thiols have a pKa ≥ 8 ( Finkel , 2011 ) . This means that they will not readily oxidize . In some cases , protein folding can create a microenvironment wherein the pKa of a cysteine thiol can reach as low as 4 making it primed for oxidation by ROS ( Finkel , 2011 ) . ROS do not diffuse over great distances within the cell ( Finkel , 2011 ; Lim et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , another mechanism to control oxidative specificity is to maintain redox - sensitive targets in close approximation to sources of ROS . One example of this is protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) 1B . Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) signaling 2 propagates via kinase cascades and PTP - 1B acts as a negative regulator of this pathway by removing phosphate groups from downstream target proteins ( Flint et al . , 1997 ) . PTP - 1B is also redox sensitive , and becomes inactive when oxidized ( Salmeen et al . , 2003 ) . In addition to the initiation of kinase cascades , EGF binding leads to the production of ROS at the membrane . Since PTP - 1B localizes to the membrane , it becomes oxidized and inactivated upon EGF binding ( Lee et al . , 1998 ; Finkel , 2011 ) . Redox inactivation of PTP - 1B allows EGF signaling to propagate locally to the site of activated EGF receptor while PTP - 1B outside of the local ROS gradient remains active . A large part of the reason that ROS do not diffuse in cells is the presence of antioxidants . Cells maintain a battery of antioxidants that serve to regulate the redox balance including peroxiredoxin , glutathione peroxidase , catalase , thioredoxin , superoxide dismutase and others ( Cerutti et al . , 1994 ; Sarsour et al . , 2009 ) . Antioxidants have been shown to be active components of signaling pathways . In the PTP signaling pathway detailed above , the local activity of peroxiredoxins would quickly clear ROS , leading to PTP activation and a loss of kinase - mediated signaling . To counter this , peroxiredoxin I is inactivated by phosphorylation downstream of the activated EGF receptor which allows a sustained , local increase in ROS that maintains PTP - 1B inactivation ( Woo et al . , 2010 ) . Alternatively , antioxidants can act more directly in signaling pathways . Thioredoxin has been shown to bind and inhibit apoptotic signal - regulating kinase 1 ( ASK1 ) ( Saitoh et al . , 1998 ) . Binding is blocked when thioredoxin is oxidized by ROS which allows ASK1 - mediated apoptotic signaling to proceed . Similar inhibitory antioxidant binding has been shown to contribute to cardiac hypertrophy via the regulation of histone deacetylases ( Yamamoto et al . , 2003 ; Ago et al . , 2008 ) . 3 Collectively , these studies show that ROS can act as cellular signals despite their biochemical promiscuity . 1 . 2 Sources of ROS and downstream effectors Having established that ROS act as cellular signals , we should next consider the sources of ROS and targets of ROS - mediated oxidation . ROS are produced from several enzymes , but the most significant contributors are a class of enzymes called nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidases ( NOX ) and mitochondria ( Wilson and Gonzalez - Billault , 2015 ) . Functions of mitochondrial ROS in cell signaling have been extensively reviewed elsewhere ( Finkel , 2012 ; Shadel and Horvath , 2015 ) . NOX - derived ROS are excellent candidates for cellular signals because NOX enzymes can be localized to specific sites . Unlike mitochondria , the activity of many NOX enzymes can be regulated to restrict the production of ROS . These enzymes have been implicated in various signaling pathways , many of which will be discussed in this and later chapters . Our lab is interested in the growth and guidance of neuronal growth cones . Growth cones are actin - rich structures located at the tips of developing axons and neurites that guide these processes toward their final targets ( Levitan and Kaczmarek , 2002 ) . Growth cones can be divided into three domains : the peripheral domain ( P ) , the transition zone ( T ) and the central domain ( C , Figure 1 . 1 ) The peripheral domain is comprised largely of actin and contains filopodia , long bundles of actin filaments , and lamellipodia , a meshwork of actin ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Both filopodia and lamellipodia are dynamic , adding new actin monomers at the leading edge and depolymerizing actin 4 structures at the transition zone . This , along with action of myosins , leads to a constant retrograde flow of actin from the periphery to the transition zone ( Levitan and Kaczmarek , 2002 ) . Growth cone turning is accomplished by asymmetric changes in actin dynamics that lead to biased protrusion on one side versus the other . Full turning responses are accompanied by the extension of the microtubule - rich central domain into the actin - based protrusions . Growth cone guidance is the fundamental process that underlies axon outgrowth during neurodevelopment and regeneration . Since growth cone motility is dependent on the cytoskeleton , it shares basic , cell biological mechanisms with other cellular functions in motile cells . Therefore , we are most interested in NOX enzymes as they relate to cell motility , cytoskeletal remodeling , neurodevelopment and nervous system function . Figure 1 . 1 : Neuronal growth cones ( A ) Schematic of cytoskeletal organization in the growth cone . Microtubules ( green ) and actin ( red ) are highly organized in the three domains : peripheral ( P ) , transition zone ( T ) and central ( C ) . ( B ) Aplysia growth cone imaged using DIC optic with the domains labeled . ( C ) The same growth cone shown in B labeled for actin and microtubules . Axon guidance and the subsequent establishment of neuronal connections are dependent on interpretation of external cues by the neuronal growth cone that cause turning . These cues include secreted ligands , growth factors , extracellular matrix proteins , 5 cell - surface proteins and proteoglycans ( O ' Donnell et al . , 2009 ; Kolodkin and Tessier - Lavigne , 2011 ; Masu , 2015 ) . NOX enzymes have been implicated in signaling downstream from many of these molecules . Specific examples will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7 with respect to the results obtained in my experiments . However , the net result of all the aforementioned signaling pathways is cytoskeletal modification that drives axon guidance . Given the central importance of the cytoskeleton in axon outgrowth and neurodevelopment , it is important to understand how redox regulation impacts the organization and dynamics of actin and microtubules . 1 . 2 . 1 Redox regulation of actin Treatment of monomeric actin with 5 - 20mM hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) decreases assembly rates ( DalleDonne et al . , 1995 ) . The same study found that oxidized actin took longer to reach equilibrium in vitro and the resulting actin filaments were more fragile than those derived from non - oxidized monomers . From additional data , the same group concluded that fragment instability was caused by weaker interactions with actin binding proteins such as alpha actinin ( DalleDonne et al . , 1995 ; Milzani et al . , 1997 ) . They then found that specific methionine residues along with cysteine 374 were the targets of oxidation , and they identified increased actin oxidation in human patients suffering from neurodegeneration ( Dalle - Donne et al . , 2001 ; Dalle - Donne et al . , 2002 ) . In a separate study , the authors showed that reversible S - glutathionylation of cysteine 374 decreases actin polymerization rate by subtly altering the conformation of the actin monomer ( Dalle - Donne et al . , 2003 ) . Additional studies showed that cysteine 272 was oxidized 6 specifically by the addition of hydrogen H 2 O 2 , and this oxidation caused a weaker interaction with cofilin leading to filament instability ( Lassing et al . , 2007 ) . In addition to actin , myosin has also been shown to be redox sensitive . Treatment of skeletal muscle with high doses of H 2 O 2 ( 5 and 50mM ) caused structural changes in myosin , and decreased actomyosin contractility ( Prochniewicz et al . , 2008 ) . However , it should be noted that 50mM H 2 O 2 may not be physiologically relevant , and the authors did not account for the impact of actin oxidation on contractile responses . Most published work shows that oxidation via H 2 O 2 reduces actin polymerization . All of these studies used concentrations of H 2 O 2 in excess of 5mM . Application of 1 - 5mM H 2 O 2 to p388DI cell lysates in vitro caused as much as a 50 % increase in polymerized actin ( Omann et al . , 1994 ) . The authors went on to show that this increase was not due to a greater number of nucleation events . Another study used endothelial monolayer wounding assays to show that increased ROS production at the wound margin correlated with increased actin assembly and faster cell migration ( Moldovan et al . , 2000 ) . The authors also used ROS scavengers to demonstrate the necessity of ROS production to actin assembly in these cells . In endothelial cells , ROS stimulation enhances actin retrograde flow leading to protrusion and the leading edge of the membrane ( Taulet et al . , 2012 ) . Our lab has show that reductions in exogenous ROS lead to decreased actin flow rates and slower neurite outgrowth in neuronal growth cones ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . Integrin - based cell adhesions are accompanied by ROS production . One study showed that ROS in this pathway leads to actin glutathionylation which caused persistent stress fibers and a lack of cell spreading ( Fiaschi et al . , 2006 ) . The authors found that this was due to the stability of the actomyosin complex when actin was oxidized . 7 1 . 2 . 2 Redox regulation of microtubules Like many other proteins , monomeric tubulin can be reversibly modified to regulate microtubule dynamics ( Janke , 2014 ) . Unlike actin , much of the literature on redox regulation of tubulin focuses on reactive nitrogen in lieu of ROS ( Landino et al . , 2007 ; Wilson and Gonzalez - Billault , 2015 ) . Tubulin monomers can undergo S - glutathionylation after oxidation by reactive nitrogen , and the sites of these modifications have been identified via crystallography ( Lowe et al . , 2001 ; Nogales and Zhang , 2016 ) . Studying the direct oxidation of tubulin in vitro is difficult given the short lifetime of reactive nitrogen in the conditions necessary for microtubule polymerization . The challenges and necessary compromises are detailed in other literature ( Sparaco et al . , 2006 ; Wilson and Gonzalez - Billault , 2015 ) , but the central message is how tubulin oxidation affects microtubule dynamics is still not fully understood . Oxidation has been shown to impact microtubule dynamics by modifying microtubule associated proteins ( MAPs ) . H 2 O 2 - induced oxidation of cysteines in tau and MAP2 caused a decrease in microtubule assembly and stability in vitro ( Landino et al . , 2004 ) . This effect of this oxidation was reversible suggesting a possible role for redox regulation of microtubules via MAPs . It has also been shown that MAPs impact the transport of cargo along microtubules by interacting with specific motor proteins ( Dixit et al . , 2008 ) . One study showed that nitrosylation of MAP1B caused neurite retraction by decreasing microtubule stabilization ( Stroissnigg et al . , 2007 ) . Neurite retraction was dependent on dynein suggesting an interaction between MAPs , cytoskeletal motors and microtubule stability . 8 1 . 3 Linking extracellular signaling to redox control of the cytoskeleton Many of the studies on redox regulation of the cytoskeleton have used cell - free , in vitro polymerization assays to determine the impact of oxidation or reduction . Some have used migrating cells to correlate ROS production with actin dynamics and migration . However , none of the studies discussed to this point described a signaling pathway that begins with an extracellular ligand and leads to ROS - mediated changes in the cytoskeleton that affect motility . In the last decade , studies focused on a protein called molecules interacting with CasL ( Mical ) elucidated this type of redox - mediated pathway that directs the growth of axons in Drosophila . The structure of Mical was resolved by two different groups around the same time ( Nadella et al . , 2005 ; Siebold et al . , 2005 ) . Mical was then shown to be critical for transduction of semaphorin - plexin - mediated collapse responses in Drosophila neurons during central nervous system development ( Ayoob et al . , 2006 ) . Collapsin response mediator proteins ( CRMPs ) are necessary for axon turning in response to repulsive semaphorin cues . Association with CRMP , induced by semaphorin , activated Mical , and this activity was necessary for axon guidance in vivo ( Schmidt et al . , 2008 ) . Although Mical was now firmly established as a mediator of semaphorin - induced axonal guidance , the link to ROS was still unknown . In 2010 , a study reported that Mical was capable of producing ROS via a flavoprotein domain ( Hung et al . , 2010 ) . More importantly , it was found that ROS production was necessary for semaphorin - induced growth cone collapse , and that Mical associates directly with f - actin . Additional studies showed that Mical - derived oxidation 9 of actin at methionine 44 mediates cytoskeletal collapse and growth cone turning ( Hung et al . , 2011 ) . In order to be a useful signaling mechanism , actin oxidation must be reversible . In 2013 , it was found that a reductase enzyme called SelR reduces methionine 44 and restores normal actin polymerization ( Hung et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to actin , Mical - derived ROS was also found to activate CRMP via direct oxidation ( Morinaka et al . , 2011 ) . Collectively , these studies resolved a complete circuit of redox - mediated signaling that drives axon guidance . Most of this work focused on Mical in the Drosophila nervous system , but a recent study implicated semaphorin - Mical signaling in human melanoma cells . The authors reported that depletion of Sema6A or Mical1 decreased stress fiber formation and chemotaxis ( Loria et al . , 2015 ) . Over expression of either protein caused cells to be more invasive and have higher growth rates . Beyond cell motility , Mical has also been implicated in vesicle trafficking via association with Rab proteins ( Fukuda et al . , 2008 ) . Mical knockouts lead to disruptions in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking and endocytosis ( Fischer et al . , 2005 ; Van Battum et al . , 2014 ) . It has been proposed that Mical - actin interactions are important for trafficking , but it should be noted that these studies did not address Mical - derived ROS directly . Therefore , it remains unclear whether or not ROS production is necessary for trafficking . While there is still more to discover about Mical proteins , the research into Mical’s role in growth cone guidance is as complete a picture of ROS - mediated axon guidance as is currently available . Other sources of ROS in cells , like NOX , likely contribute to the propagation of guidance signals , but this remains to be studied . 10 1 . 4 Introduction of the NOX isoforms Research into NOX enzymes and redox biology extends as far back as 1908 when a respiratory burst was observed during the fertilization of sea urchin eggs ( Warburg , 1908 ) . From these initial experiments , there emerged a field of study aimed at characterizing the respiratory burst and identifying the cellular machinery responsible . In the intervening century , not only was a specific isoform of NOX implicated in the respiratory burst , but six additional NOX isoforms , each with unique functions , were characterized . NOX dysfunction was also shown to be the cause of a potentially fatal immune disease , and knowledge derived from the study of patients was critical for identifying the genes encoding NOX subunits . In the sections that follow , each NOX isoform is introduced in the order in which they were discovered . Included is a description of the enzyme complexes , a brief overview of activation mechanisms and a review of the known functions with respect to the nervous system . 1 . 4 . 1 NOX2 In 1933 , a respiratory burst similar to that in sea urchin eggs was observed in phagocytes ( Baldridge and Gerard , 1933 ) . This burst proved clinically significant in 1957 with the discovery of a rare immunological disease . Patients , typically males , developed severe infections and excessive inflammation often in the form of persistent granulomas ( Berendes et al . , 1957 ) . Ten years later , the disease now called chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) was attributed to a lack of oxidant production at infection 11 sites . The decreased ROS production was linked leukocytes , a type of phagocyte ( Baehner and Nathan , 1967 ; Holmes et al . , 1967 ; Quie et al . , 1967 ) . In the mean time , studies had identified that the respiratory burst in leukocytes produced H 2 O 2 , and that NADPH , not NADP , served as an electron donor for the reaction ( Iyer et al . , 1961 ; Rossi and Zatti , 1964 ) . Nearly thirty years after the initial identification of CGD , one of the primary genes responsible was identified and cloned ( Royer - Pokora et al . , 1986 ; Teahan et al . , 1987 ) . The gene was located on the X chromosome explaining the predominantly male , X - linked recessive pattern of CGD inheritance . The gene product was initially called gp91 phox , but is now commonly referred to as NOX2 or CYBB . It quickly became clear that NOX2 was part of a larger enzyme complex when it was discovered that deficiency of another gene encoding a protein called p22 phox , CYBA , also led to CGD ( Dinauer et al . , 1987 ; Segal , 1987 ) . The gene for p22 phox is located on chromosome 16 explaining the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance of p22 phox - based CGD . The advent of cell - free systems led to the identification of additional cytosolic subunits called p47 phox , NCF1 , and p67 phox , NCF2 ( Bromberg and Pick , 1985 ; Nunoi et al . , 1988 ; Volpp et al . , 1988 ) . By 1994 , it was established that the small GTPases Rac1 / 2 were also members of the NOX2 complex ( Abo et al . , 1991 ; Knaus et al . , 1991 ; Abo et al . , 1994 ) . Seven years after the initial cloning of the gene encoding NOX2 , the final subunit of the NOX2 complex was identified as p40 phox , NCF4 ( Wientjes et al . , 1993 ) . NOX2 and p22 phox are both transmembrane proteins , and they are tightly associated within the cell to form the enzymatic core called the flavocytochrome ( Nauseef , 2004 ) . With the exception of NOX5 and DUOX , all NOX isoforms require 12 p22 phox . Additionally , all NOX isoforms have six transmembrane alpha helices forming a pseudochannel that shuttles electrons from NADPH in the cytosol to the oxygen acceptor on the opposite face of the membrane ( Kawahara and Lambeth , 2007 ) . Alpha helices III and IV each contain two histidine residues that are responsible for the binding of heme cofactors involved in shuttling electrons ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . The composition of the NOX2 complex and other NOX complexes are shown in Figure 1 . 1 . Returning specifically to NOX2 , ROS production is initiated when the enzyme complex assembles on a membrane . The complex can be activated in several ways , but the most commonly described involves the phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein , p47 phox , and the activation of Rac . In the absence of phosphorylation , the autoinhibitory region ( AIR ) of p47 phox interacts with the phosphoinositide - binding domain , PX , to bury many of the functional domains ( Groemping et al . , 2003 ) . This closed conformation prevents p47 phox from acting as a scaffold to bring other proteins to the flavocytochrome . Upon phosphorylation and release of autoinhibition , p47 phox adopts an open conformation that allows the PX domain to act as a membrane anchor and protein scaffold . ( Ago et al . , 2003 ) . Dual Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains in p47 phox directly bind to the flavocytochrome via proline - rich regions of p22 phox ( Nakanishi et al . , 1992 ) . p47 phox also interacts with p67 phox to bring the latter into close proximity of the NOX2 active site ( el Benna et al . , 1994b ) . p67 phox contains an activation domain that significantly increases the rate of NOX2 electron transfer when aligned to the active site ( Han et al . , 1998 ) . Activated Rac translocates to the membrane independently of p47 phox , but shows a strong association with p67 phox ( Diekmann et al . , 1994 ) . In fact , strong activation of Rac is sufficient to drive p67 phox to the membrane ( Gorzalczany et al . , 2000 ) . 13 Owning to its discovery in CGD patient cells , NOX2 is most commonly associated with functions in phagocytic cells of the immune system . However , NOX2 is expressed in neurons , microglia , vascular smooth muscle cells , skeletal muscle , cardiomyocytes , hepatocytes , endothelial cells , hematopoietic stem cells and fibroblasts ( Pagano et al . , 1997 ; Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Brown and Griendling , 2009 ; Nayernia et al . , 2014 ) . NOX2 has been shown to be involved in growth factor signaling , angiogenesis , cell death and blood pressure regulation ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Brown and Griendling , 2009 ) . However , it is noteworthy that NOX2 is found in cells of the nervous system . Accordingly NOX2 has been implicated in nervous system function and maintenance in a number of ways . CGD patients were critical in identifying and characterizing NOX2 , and researchers are again turning to patients to understand the full of range of NOX2 functions in the nervous system . CGD patients suffer from mild cognitive deficiencies including below average IQ scores ( Pao et al . , 2004 ; Cole et al . , 2013 ) . However , it should be noted that severe infections in CGD patients often lead to prolonged hospitalization and social isolation ( Chiriaco et al . , 2015 ) . The authors of both studies cited above caution that lack of social and educational exposure may contribute to cognitive declines . However , NOX2 is expressed in neurons and several neuronal functions are known so there remains a possibility that the enzyme plays a direct role in brain development . In adult mouse brains , there is direct evidence that hippocampal neurons express NOX2 , and that the enzyme plays a significant functional role . One of the first studies on this topic showed that mice overexpressing superoxide dismutase , a potent antioxidant 14 enzyme , do not undergo long - term potentiation ( Thiels et al . , 2000 ) . In cultured hippocampal neurons , NOX2 subunits were identified in cell bodies and dendrites via immunohistochemistry ( Tejada - Simon et al . , 2005 ) . Further , direct activation of NOX led to the colocalization of NOX2 regulatory subunits at presynaptic sites . A separate study found that inhibition of NOX2 leads to polarization defects and decreased neurite extension in mouse hippocampal neurons ( Wilson et al . , 2015 ) . The authors confirmed that NOX2 subunits were localized throughout the cell , and found that several NOX2 - specific inhibitors caused alterations in the actin cytoskeleton that presumably led to neurite outgrowth defects . Studies performed on mice lacking either NOX2 or p47 phox , rodent models of CGD , identified impairments in spatial and context dependent - fear memory formation ( Kishida et al . , 2006 ) . Both of these behaviors are mediated by the hippocampus . Additionally , these in vivo experiments showed that NOX2 deficient mice do not undergo long - term potentiation in hippocampal neurons . All of these studies , taken together , clearly show the importance of NOX2 in learning and memory processes mediated by the hippocampus . See Figure 1 . 1 for a summary of the known roles for NOX2 in the nervous system . Neural stem cell potency is dependent on the maintenance of high ROS levels in progenitors ( Le Belle et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Adult hippocampal stem cells rely on high ROS levels to maintain self - renewal and normal progenitor function . It is perhaps unsurprising that NOX2 has been identified as a major source of ROS in adult hippocampal stem cells ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) . Inhibition of NOX2 leads to depletion of neural progenitors and defective neurogenesis . This may suggest that NOX2 function is critical for hippocampal development and maintenance in addition to memory and 15 learning . It is tempting to speculate that cognitive declines in CGD patients may stem from NOX2 dysfunction in the hippocampus that impacts memory , learning and / or neurogenesis . This speculation remains untested , but is worthy of further investigation . Moving out of the hippocampus , NOX2 has also been found in cerebellar granule neurons ( CGN ) . CGNs are small , tightly packed neurons that allow for complex coding of input information . In 2009 , a group found that staurosporine - induced apoptotic death in CGNs was mediated by NOX2 activity ( Guemez - Gamboa and Moran , 2009 ) . CGNs derived from NOX2 knockout mice were less sensitive to staurosporine than wild type controls . Apoptosis in CGNs can be triggered in multiple ways , and researchers found that NOX2 was specifically activated by staurosporine and not other apoptotic signals . This finding indicates that NOX2 is not a general apoptotic signal , but acts in a specific pathway . While the previous study implicates NOX2 in cell death , NOX2 has also been shown to promote the maturation of CGNs ( Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) . Using CGN cultures , authors showed that NOX inhibitors and general antioxidants caused a decrease in neuronal maturity after three days in vitro . Maturity was measured by morphology as well as the presence of mature neuronal markers , Tau and MAP2 . NOX2 was identified in the growth cones and filopodia of developing CGN neurites , and colocalized to the sites of H 2 O 2 production . Additionally , the authors described an increase in ROS at one day in vitro that was critical for CGN survival . CGNs derived from NOX2 knockout mice displayed short neurites which is consistent with what was observed in response to NOX inhibitors ( Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) . 16 NOX2 is also implicated in tissue damage following brain injury . Inflammation driven by NOX2 - derived ROS has been shown to promote tissue damage following ischemic stroke ( Carbone et al . , 2014 ) . NOX inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate the inflammation and tissue damage in laboratory studies . Unfortunately , NOX2 activity might also directly increase the probability of stroke occurrence by contributing to the formation of arterial plaques ( Sierra et al . , 2011 ) . A separate study showed that the application of a NOX inhibitor , apocynin , attenuated nearly all markers of neural damage following traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) in mice ( Lu et al . , 2014 ) . Apocynin - treated mice showed a decrease in neuronal apoptosis , blood - brain barrier disruption and cognitive deficiency . The authors focused on cortical injuries , and found that NOX2 expression sharply increased immediately following TBI . This may indicate that NOX2 is a marker of inflammation and damage in cortical cells . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a disease characterized by the progressive atrophy of motor neurons that eventually leads to a loss of muscle control . As there is no cure , current treatments focus on slowing disease progression . Rac1 , a critical regulator of NOX function , is known to be involved in cytoskeletal organization in mature neurons . Through the misregualtion of Rac1 , NOX has been implicated in ALS disease progression ( D ' Ambrosi et al . , 2014 ) . NOX2 has been identified as a key source of damaging ROS in ALS models ( Boillee and Cleveland , 2008 ) . A recent study of human ALS patients confirmed the experimental results from rodent models . This study showed that lower levels of endogenous NOX2 activity lead to modest increases in patient survival ( Marrali et al . , 2014 ) . This makes NOX2 a promising therapeutic target for future studies . 17 Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) is a neurodegenerative condition causing dementia and memory loss . In the United States , approximately 5 million individuals over the age of 65 have AD ( Association , 2014 ) . The disease is characterized by the progressive loss of neurons due to the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ( Association , 2014 ) . Compared to non - diseased , age - matched controls , human cortical sections from AD patients exhibited higher expression of genes encoding p47 phox , p67 phox and p40 phox , but not NOX2 itself ( Ansari and Scheff , 2011 ) . Further , NOX2 activity correlated well with symptom severity suggesting that ROS production is a predictor of disease progression . As with the TBI study mentioned earlier , these experiments focused on cortical tissues from AD patients . In both cases , it is unclear whether NOX2 contributes to normal cellular function in the cortex or is expressed only in the diseased state . The answer to this question may shed light on what role , if any , NOX2 plays in disease onset as opposed to progression . AD patients also have lesions in the hippocampus leading to memory loss ( Association , 2014 ) . Given the well - established function of NOX2 in the hippocampus , it is possible , although untested , that NOX2 misregulation contributes to the onset of AD pathology in this brain region . Although NOX2 activity correlates well with AD severity , mouse models of AD treated with the NOX inhibitor apocynin were not significantly protected ( Dumont et al . , 2011 ) . Inhibitor - treated mice showed no change in the extent of brain lesions or cognitive declines . Conversely , a previous study showed that genetic NOX2 deficiency in the same AD mouse model improved cognitive and histopathological symptoms ( Park et al . , 2008 ) . Drug administration is less potent than genetic knockouts , and this may explain the discordant results . However , it should be noted that NOX2 deficient mice also develop 18 CGD . This poses serious ethical questions regarding the viability of NOX2 as a target for gene therapy or other genetic manipulations . Nonetheless , these studies present a paradox concerning the viability of NOX2 as a target for AD therapies that is worthy of continued study . 1 . 4 . 2 NOX1 Researchers were surprised to find that fibroblasts and neutrophils from CGD patients were capable of producing a respiratory burst ( Emmendorffer et al . , 1993 ) . This clearly showed that ROS production in these cells was not mediated by NOX2 . As the final components of the NOX2 complex were identified in 1993 , the search was on for additional enzymes capable of generating bursts of ROS . In 1999 , a homolog of NOX2 called mitogenic oxidase 1 ( MOX1 , now NOX1 ) was identified and cloned ( Suh et al . , 1999 ) . Cytosolic subunits for the NOX1 complex , NOXO1 and NOXA1 , were found four years later ( Banfi et al . , 2003 ; Geiszt et al . , 2003 ) . Similar to p47 phox , NOXO1 functions as a scaffold to bring the activation domain of NOXA1 near to the active site of NOX1 . NOXO1 contains similar PX , SH3 and PRR domains that mediate protein - protein interactions involved in scaffolding . One critical difference between p47 phox and NOXO1 is the absence of the AIR in NOXO1 ( Cheng and Lambeth , 2004 ) . This means that NOXO1 activity is not phosphorylation dependent . However , NOX1 activity is still dependent on Rac giving the complex some degree of regulation despite the constitutive activity of NOXO1 ( Park et al . , 2004 ; Miyano et al . , 2006 ; Ueyama et al . , 2006 ) . Like p67 phox , NOXA1 interacts directly with Rac in addition 19 to NOXO1 , and contains an activation domain necessary for optimal NOX1 function ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . Figure 1 . 2 : Composition of the NOX complexes The active form of each NOX enzyme complex is shown . The enzyme complexes assemble on the plasma membrane or vesicular membranes . It is unknown whether NOXA1 and Rac are necessary for NOX3 . Misregulation leads to the conditions and / or diseases listed below each complex , discussed and cited in the text . There have been no functions associated with NOX3 / 5 in the nervous system . PX indicates the peroxidase - like domain of DUOX1 / 2 . 20 NOX1 is most closely associated with expression in the colon epithelia , but expression has also been shown in endothelial cells , vascular smooth muscle cells , retinal pericytes , uterus , placenta and prostate ( Cui et al . , 2006 ; Rokutan et al . , 2008 ; Brown and Griendling , 2009 ; Sorce and Krause , 2009 ) . NOX1 has been implicated in canonical Wnt - beta catenin signaling , and hypoxic injury ( Kajla et al . , 2012 ; Spencer et al . , 2013 ) . NOX1 is also important for the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and colon adenocarcinoma cells suggesting a possible role in cancer metastasis ( Schroder et al . , 2007 ; Sadok et al . , 2008 ; Zimmerman et al . , 2011 ) . The enzyme has also been identified in the nervous system , but the functions of NOX1 are less extensively studied compared with NOX2 . Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra which leads to progressively worsening movement disorders ( Jimenez - Shahed , 2016 ) . Current therapies aim to slow progression of the symptoms , but there is still no cure . Cell culture models revealed that a selective dopaminergic neuronal toxin , 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - HD ) , causes increased expression of NOX1 mRNA ( Choi et al . , 2012 ) . Another study using the same culture model showed that protein kinase C delta and NOX1 mediate cell death in dopaminergic neurons under oxidative stress conditions ( Cristovao et al . , 2013 ) . Knockdown of protein kinase C delta led to a subsequent decrease in NOX1 activity and increased neuronal survival . In live rats , injection of 6 - HD into the brain also increased NOX1 expression in the substantia nigra , but the protein was surprisingly localized to the nucleus ( Choi et al . , 2012 ) . Accordingly , 6 - HD treated rats exhibited oxidative DNA damage and death of 21 dopaminergic neurons . Knockdown of NOX1 ameliorated both conditions . Collectively , these findings portray NOX1 as a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson’s disease . Inflammation is a common hallmark of many neuropathologies including trauma to the central nervous system ( Ansari and Scheff , 2011 ; Lu et al . , 2014 ; Marrali et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Microglia are responsible for inflammation in the central nervous system , and are thus often targeted in therapies for brain and spinal cord injury . Using purified microglia from mice , researchers found that activation via lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) elicits an increase in NOX1 activity which leads to nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) activation and neurotoxicity ( Cheret et al . , 2008 ) . Both NOX1 and NOX2 contribute to this process , but NOX1 was necessary for maximum ROS production . NOX1 knockout mice were protected from LPS - induced neurodegeneration , and showed decreased NOS activity . As inflammation is a symptom of many neuropathologies , the discovery of NOX1 in this signaling pathway may be the most promising therapeutic target yet presented . 1 . 4 . 3 NOX3 NOX3 was first identified in 2000 by several independent groups ( Kikuchi et al . , 2000 ; Cheng et al . , 2001 ; Banfi et al . , 2004a ) . p22 phox is necessary for activity , but the additional regulatory subunits of the NOX3 complex are still a matter of some debate . It is clear that NOXO1 is needed for optimal ROS production , but it may not be essential for basal NOX3 activity ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . NOX3 is highly expressed in the inner ear , an organ involved in balance control . NOXO1 deficient mice exhibit 22 locomotion and balance defects that indicate inner ear dysfunction ( Kiss et al . , 2006 ) . The same study went on to link NOXO1 in the inner ear with NOX3 activity . This provides evidence that NOXO1 is needed for NOX3 activity in vivo . Whether NOXA1 or Rac are necessary for NOX3 function is currently unclear ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . As stated , NOX3 expression is closely associated with the inner ear , but additional expression has been identified in a range of human fetal tissues including kidney and spleen ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , NOX3 expression has been found in human colon epithelial cells ( Kikuchi et al . , 2000 ) . There is currently no data on NOX3 expression in the nervous system , and no NOX3 - associated functions . However , it is possible that hearing and balance defects in NOX3 knockouts are caused disruptions in the connections between the inner ear and nervous system . Additional studies into the specific mechanisms of NOX3 - mediated signaling are needed to address this possibility . 1 . 4 . 4 NOX4 The gene encoding NOX4 was originally identified in kidney tissue in the year 2000 ( Geiszt et al . , 2000 ; Shiose et al . , 2001 ) . NOX4 is unique from other isoforms in that function is not dependent on any cytosolic subunits ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . NOX4 does interact with p22 phox , however , and this interaction is necessary for activity . The absence of cytosolic subunits led many to speculate that NOX4 is constitutively active , and this is confirmed in cell free systems ( Bedard et al . , 2012 ) . However , NOX4 is comparatively sensitive to cellular conditions such as the presence of free oxygen , and this may act as a mechanism modulate NOX4 activity ( Nisimoto et al . , 2014 ) . Activation 23 may also be controlled at the level of transcription . Many NOX4 - dependent signaling pathways have been shown to control the expression of NOX4 mRNA ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . While details regarding the mechanisms of regulation are still being investigated , NOX4 has been identified in many cell and tissue types . As mentioned , NOX4 was first discovered in kidney tissue . Since then NOX4 has been found in neurons , osteoclasts , vascular smooth muscle cells , hematopoietic stem cells , fibroblasts , keratinocytes , melanomas and neural crest cells ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Lee et al . , 2014 ) . NOX4 activity is involved in vascular smooth muscle cell function , and NOX4 deficient mice are predisposed for obesity ( Lyle et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2012a ) . Adding to the range of NOX4 functions , the enzyme is also necessary for influenza A replication in lung epithelia ( Amatore et al . , 2015 ) . Damage to peripheral neurons , either by injury or disease , can result in prolonged pain . This condition is clinically known as neuropathic pain , and approximately 20 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with some form of this condition ( Yawn et al . , 2009 ) . A widespread cause of neuropathic pain is peripheral neuropathy , commonly caused by diabetes or chemotherapy treatment . Additional routine causes of neuropathic pain include injury , surgical complications or other unknown sources ( Yawn et al . , 2009 ) . One group found NOX4 expression in peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia in the mouse . They went on to show that mice lacking NOX4 exhibit a decrease in peripheral nerve demyelination following nerve injury ( Kallenborn - Gerhardt et al . , 2012 ) . The NOX4 - deficient mice also display a decrease in behaviors indicative of neuropathic pain . The study provides evidence that NOX4 may contribute both to the 24 extent of nerve injury and to the perception of neuropathic pain in mouse models . Given the prevalence of neuropathic pain in humans , this is an important discovery that may lead to improved therapeutic strategies . The role of NOX2 in cell death following ischemic stroke was presented earlier , but a separate study found that NOX4 is more important in post - stroke neuroprotection . The research showed that NOX4 expression is increased in both humans and mice following ischemia ( Kleinschnitz et al . , 2010 ) . NOX4 deficient mice , but not those deficient in NOX1 / 2 , were protected from neuronal apoptosis , and this was specifically due to the reduction of oxidative stress . The extent of neuroprotection was unaffected by age . Mice treated with a NOX inhibitor , VAS2870 , hours after the onset of ischemic stroke showed decreased neuronal apoptosis and improved long - term cognitive function compared to sham - treated controls . This has major clinical significance since viable therapies for use in humans must be effective even when applied long after the onset of a stroke ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . NOX4 contributes to the survival and fate determination of neural crest stem cells ( NCSCs ) during development . Cultured NCSCs treated with bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( BMP2 ) differentiate into neurons , and this process is dependent on the production of ROS ( Lee et al . , 2014 ) . One group found that NOX4 was expressed in NCSCs , neuronal differentiation was blocked in NOX4 knockouts ( Lee et al . , 2014 ) . This effect was reproduced in cells treated with NOX inhibitors . Strangely , NOX4 deficient mice do not display any defects in NCSC - derived tissues . The authors note that homozygous NOX4 knockout pups are not born at the expected rate , suggesting NOX4 knockout may be lethal , and they speculate that molecular compensation might mask the phenotype . 25 1 . 4 . 5 NOX5 NOX5 was first identified in the testis , spleen and lymph node in 2001 ( Banfi et al . , 2001 ) . In lieu of cytosolic subunits , NOX5 relies on direct phosphorylation and calcium binding for activation ( Banfi et al . , 2004b ) . NOX5 contains two EF hand motifs that cooperatively bind calcium ions to elicit protein function ( Bedard et al . , 2012 ) . NOX5 has been shown to interact directly with calmodulin , and calmodulin modulates the calcium sensitivity of NOX5 ( Tirone and Cox , 2007 ) . Additionally , NOX5 can be phosphorylated at two sites to induce ROS production ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . NOX5 forms a homodimer in order to function , and activity does not require the presence p22 phox like all of the previously described NOX isoforms ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . In addition to the tissues mentioned above , NOX5 is also expressed in endothelial cells , vascular smooth muscle cells , pancreas , placenta , ovary , uterus , stomach and multiple fetal tissue ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . NOX5 has been shown to be involved in thrombin - mediated proliferation in human endothelial cells , and platelet derived growth factor - mediated proliferation in smooth muscle cells ( BelAiba et al . , 2007 ; Jay et al . , 2008 ) . There is currently no known function for NOX5 in the nervous system . 1 . 4 . 6 DUOX1 / 2 Originally called thyroid oxidases , dual oxidases ( DUOX1 and DUOX2 ) were the last NOX - related isoforms to be identified ( Dupuy et al . , 1999 ; De Deken et al . , 2000 ) . Like NOX5 , DUOX1 / 2 are activated by calcium binding to EF hand motifs . The proteins 26 are called ‘dual’ oxidases because they contain a large N - terminal peroxidase - like domain in addition to the flavocytochrome ( Lambeth et al . , 2007 ) . There is significant debate regarding the importance of the extracellular peroxidase - like domain , but patients with mutations in this domain exhibit hypothyroidism ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) , suggesting some nominal function . DUOX1 / 2 are claimed to directly produce H 2 O 2 , but this seems unlikely given the biochemical restraints of the monoelectron reactions of NOX family members . Rather , some have postulated that superoxide is direct product , but DUOX1 / 2 facilitate rapid dismutation into H 2 O 2 ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . DUOX1 / 2 are expressed , as the original name implies , in the thyroid . Additionally , they are expressed in the epithelia of the airway and gastrointestinal tract , testis , uterus , gall bladder , pancreas and cerebellum ( Harper et al . , 2006 ; Lambeth et al . , 2007 ) . As mentioned , DUOX2 mutations have been shown to cause hypothyroidism thus demonstrating function in the thyroid . Additionally , DUOX has been show to be involved in cytokine - mediated neutrophil recruitment in zebrafish ( de Oliveira et al . , 2015 ) . There are no studies of DUOX expression or function in nervous system cells . However , DUOX activity has tangentially been shown to guide and promote the regeneration of damaged peripheral nerves in the zebrafish tail ( Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ) . In this study , peripheral nerves were damaged either by tail clipping or laser nerve ablation . Normally , new axons completely reinnervate the regenerated tail , and this is accompanied by tissue - scale ROS production . The authors found that DUOX knockdown decreased overall axon outgrowth and caused less extensive reinnervation . Further investigation showed that the ROS gradient stemmed from DUOX expressed in damaged keratocytes , not from the neurons themselves . The DUOX - derived ROS created a tissue - scale gradient that acted as 27 a cue to guide the newly growing axons . While this study did not provide any evidence that DUOX has a cell - autonomous role in neurons , it is noteworthy that damaged axons followed an increasing gradient of ROS in this system . In contrast , most models of axon regeneration posit that ROS inhibit axon outgrowth . From what is known , overproduction of ROS by the glial scar acts as an inhibitory signal for axon regrowth , but antioxidant therapies for brain and spinal cord injuries have been largely unsuccessful ( Hall , 2011 ) . It is possible that low concentrations of ROS might act as positive growth signals while higher concentrations are inhibitory . This idea is supported by earlier work from our lab ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) , and extended by my work ( Chapter 3 ) . 1 . 5 Additional roles for NOX in the nervous system General ROS production was shown to affect neuronal fate determination in cortical cultures from embryonic rats ( Tsatmali et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with what is known about neuronal precursors in mouse hippocampus ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) , cortical neurons from embryonic day 15 rats displayed a high level of ROS production ( Tsatmali et al . , 2006 ) . ROS levels were found to be reliable predictors of neuronal subtype , and antioxidant treatments shifted this distribution without affecting cell survival . Further , the authors reported that ROS production was limited to cortical progenitors by postnatal day 20 . While the study did not specify a source of ROS , the findings are similar to the pattern of NOX2 - derived ROS in the hippocampus described earlier . Regardless of the source , the current study shows that ROS contributes to fate determination in cortical neurons . 28 Staying with neuronal differentiation , PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor ( NGF ) display neurite outgrowth and the expression of neuron - specific genes such as AP - 1 . NGF stimulation of PC12 cells is accompanied by ROS production and inhibiting this ROS blocks the adoption of a neural fate ( Suzukawa et al . , 2000 ) . This study did not directly prove the involvement of NOX in this process , but the authors did show that a dominant negative Rac1 also blocks ROS production and neuronal differentiation . Therefore , it is possible that a Rac1 - dependent NOX isoform is involved in the induction of PC12 cells to a neuronal fate . NOX activity has also been linked to brain development . The prenatal administration of apocynin led to gross morphological changes in the rat cerebellum . ROS production was reduced in the cerebellum of inhibitor - treated rats , and cerebellar folia were underdeveloped as a result ( Coyoy et al . , 2013 ) . Accordingly , rats treated with apocynin showed decreased motor coordination indicative of cerebellar dysfunction . Recall that NOX2 promotes CGN maturation ( Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) . It is then reasonable to speculate that NOX inhibitor application may lead to the underdevelopment of the cerebellum by blocking NOX2 - mediated CGN maturation . 1 . 6 Overview of experimental work Our lab investigates cellular signaling involved in the growth and guidance of neuronal growth cones . Growth cones are specialized , highly motile structures that direct axons to their targets by receiving and interpreting extracellular signals . Therefore , axon guidance and the neuronal connectivity are dependent on the function of growth cones . 29 There is very little known about the role of NOX or even ROS in axonal growth and guidance . However , axon outgrowth and turning are driven by actin and microtubule - based cellular machinery and both of these proteins are redox sensitive . Furthermore , Mical , another ROS - generating enzyme , mediates axon guidance by direct oxidation of actin . Finally , signaling pathways that induce cell migration and cytoskeletal rearrangements in non - neuronal cells require NOX - derived ROS . The basic cellular machinery that drives motility in these cells is often conserved in growth cones . Our lab has previously shown that growth cones from cultured Aplysia ( Aplysia californica ) neurons are sensitive to changes in ROS . Specifically , we found that application of antioxidants led to decreased neurite outgrowth , disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and slowed actin retrograde flow ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . The first part of my study was to determine whether NOX - derived ROS are important for the outgrowth and overall viability of cultured Aplysia neurons ( Chapter 3 ) . In this set of experiments , we identified a NOX2 - like protein in Aplysia neurons and showed that NOX activity is necessary for proper neurite outgrowth . Additionally , we showed that elements of the NOX2 complex colocalize with actin and depend on actin for transport . In vivo , the proper function of growth cones leads to the formation of axon tracts and the establishment of neuronal connections . In addition to axon guidance , many events including , but not limited to cell migration , proliferation , stem cell maintenance and differentiation contribute to the larger process of neurodevelopment . Most of these cellular functions have been linked to ROS or NOX in non - neuronal cells . With this knowledge and having shown that NOX is important for neurite outgrowth , I investigated the impact of NOX on neurodevelopment . 30 Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) are ideal for studying vertebrate neurodevelopment due to their transparent bodies and external fertilization that make them highly compatible with in vivo imaging . However , many NOX studies use mice and rats since they are mammalian systems that often translate well to humans . Despite the fact that rodents do not carry NOX5 , the availability of NOX1 - 4 and DUOX2 knockout mice has contributed to their popularity ( Altenhofer et al . , 2012 ; Bedard et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , it has been comparatively difficult to generate targeted mutations in zebrafish so the production of gene knockouts has been rare . However , the advent of site - specific mutagenesis strategies designed especially for zebrafish has made an already powerful developmental model even more so ( Jao et al . , 2013 ) . It is now possible to precisely edit the zebrafish genome and generate mutant lines using a process that is comparatively simple when measured against generating genetic mutants in mammals . Therefore , I used zebrafish embryos to study the role of NOX in neurodevelopment . I first characterized nox gene expression in the zebrafish nervous system during the first two days development , a period that coincides with a great deal of neurodevelopment . Using quantitative PCR and extensive in situ hybridization , I discovered broad but dynamic expression of nox1 , nox2 / cybb , nox5 and duox ( Chapter 4 ) . The expression domains were overlapping indicating the simultaneous presence of multiple nox genes in many tissues . While the results of this study did not provide information on cell - type specific nox expression , they do show that nox genes are expressed in the nervous system which may suggest a function . I then investigated the function of NOX in neurodevelopment ( Chapter 5 ) . I found that optic nerve development was affected by the application of NOX inhibitors . Using 31 site - specific mutagenesis ( CRISPR / Cas9 ) I determined that NOX2 ( CYBB in zebrafish ) mutants had similar defects in the optic nerve indicating that NOX2 / CYBB was important for development . Finally , I found that NOX2 / CYBB homozygous mutants displayed an expansion of retinal ganglion cells in the eye and mistargeting of axons to the midbrain . In summary , the aim of this study was to investigate the role of NOX in axon outgrowth and neurodevelopmental . I first showed that NOX is expressed in Aplysia neurons and is important for neurite outgrowth . I then transitioned to in vivo work to show that nox genes are expressed in the zebrafish nervous system during development . Finally , I performed functional studies in zebrafish to show that NOX activity is necessary for retinal development and axon targeting . 32 CHAPTER 2 . METHODS 2 . 1 General methods 2 . 1 . 1 Zebrafish housing and breeding All animal work and experimental protocols were approved by the Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee . Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) of the AB or Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) line were maintained according to standard procedures ( Westerfield , 2000 ; Hensley and Leung , 2010 ) . NOX mutant lines were generated as described in section 2 . 4 . 7 . To generate embryos , parental fish were placed into breeding tanks and separated by a clear divider overnight . The following morning , adults were moved to a new breeding tank with fresh water , the divider was removed and the breeding basket was tilted to force the parents into close proximity . Embryos were collected at 15 - minute intervals to obtain cohorts of the same stage . Embryos were maintained in E3 medium at 28°C and staged as described prior to harvest ( Kimmel et al . , 1995 ) . Medium was changed daily and dead embryos were removed to discourage bacterial and fungal growth . Between 12 and 23 hours post - fertilization ( hpf ) embryos used for live imaging , in situ hybridization , immunolabeling and microangiography were treated with 0 . 003 % N - Phenylthiourea ( PTU ) ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) in E3 medium to inhibit melanization ( Li et al . , 2012b ) . 33 2 . 1 . 2 Mounting embryos in 1 % low melting point agarose Agarose for mounting was dissolved in E3 media or 1x PBS depending on the experiment . For 20 mL , 0 . 2 g of analytical grade low melting point agarose ( Promega , Madison , WI , Cat . V2111 ) was added to 20 mL of solvent in an 18 x 150 mm glass culture tube . The tube was capped with foil to prevent evaporation and placed into a preheated water bath . The tube was vortexed every 5 minutes until the agarose completely dissolved . 10 mL aliquots were stored in 15 mL conical tubes at 4°C . Prior to mounting , an aliquot was microwaved briefly , no more than 10 seconds at a time , and vortexed until all the agarose had liquefied . It is important not to overheat or open the tube during heating to prevent molten agarose from escaping . The aliquot was then equilibrated in a 40°C water bath for 30 minutes prior to use . For mounting , a yellow pipette tip was cut to create an opening large enough to accommodate a single embryo . Live embryos were anesthetized in 0 . 016 % Tricaine methanesulfonate while fixed , immunolabeled samples were not anesthetized , and were transected posterior to the hindbrain to facilitate mounting . In either case , a single embryo was collected into the pipette tip . The embryo was carefully deposited into the tube containing molten agarose , and quickly recollected into the tip along with 20 - 30 µL of agarose . The embryo was then placed onto the dish or coverslip in a drop of agarose and positioned using a pin . Agarose solidifies within 1 - 2 minutes so embryos were positioned quickly . Once all samples were solidified , E3 media was added to prevent the samples from drying . 34 2 . 1 . 3 Preparation of 7 . 5 % N - Phenylthiourea stock This recipe is taken from the ZFIN Wiki ( https : / / wiki . zfin . org / display / prot / PTU - 2 ) . PTU is very toxic so eye shields , gloves and face shields were worn during handling . 0 . 75 g of PTU powder ( Sigma ) was dissolved in 10mL of anhydrous DMSO ( Sigma ) . This stock formulation was chosen because PTU dissolves quickly in DMSO without the need to heat or stir . PTU stock was then split into 1mL aliquots and stored at 4°C . 40 µL of 7 . 5 % stock was used per 100 mL of E3 media to obtain a final concentration of 0 . 003 % . 2 . 1 . 4 Determination of zebrafish Nox domains Amino acid sequences for human NOX1 ( Q9Y5S8 ) , NOX2 ( P04839 ) , NOX5 ( Q9Y5S8 ) and DUOX1 ( Q9NRD9 ) were downloaded and manually annotated using domain and binding site information from UniProt ( http : / / www . uniprot . org ) . Transmembrane helices , calcium binding domains , peroxidase - like domains and substrate binding domains were mapped to the human amino acid sequences using Vector NTI version 8 . 0 ( InforMax , Inc . now Thermo Fisher ) . Corresponding zebrafish protein sequences were downloaded from GenBank ( Nox1 , NP _ 001095857 . 1 ; Nox2 / Cybb , NP _ 956708 ; Nox5 , XP _ 009296060 . 1 ; Duox , BAF33370 . 1 ) . The sequences for each domain of the human protein were individually aligned to the full sequence of the zebrafish protein in Vector NTI . In all cases , the zebrafish sequences retained ≥80 % similarity within domains . Outside of these domains , the sequences varied . Importantly , 35 transmembrane helices III and IV retained the critical heme - binding histidine residues confirming that these sites mapped to the human sequence . Mutant proteins sequences were predicted by translating the mRNA sequences , determined for each line , using the Vector NTI . The resulting amino acid sequences were aligned to the wild type sequence to determine which functional domains were lost . Figure 7 . 2 shows all of the predicted domains that remain in the NOX mutant lines generated thus far . 2 . 2 Methods for Chapter 3 2 . 2 . 1 Aplysia bag cell neuronal culture Aplysia bag cell neurons were plated on coverslips coated with 20µg / ml poly - L - lysine ( 70 - 150 kDa ) as previously described ( Lee et al . , 2008 ; Suter , 2011 ) . Cells were kept in L15 medium ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with artificial seawater ( L15 - ASW : L15 plus 400 mM NaCl , 10 mM CaCl 2 , 27 mM MgSO 4 , 28 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM L - glutamine , 50 µg / ml gentamicin , 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 ) overnight at 14 o C . All reagents were from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) unless otherwise specified . 2 . 2 . 2 Live cell imaging and neurite outgrowth analysis For live - cell imaging , a chamber containing Aplysia bag cell neurons cultured for 1 day was prepared as recently described ( Lee et al . , 2008 ; Suter , 2011 ) . 0 . 1 % DMSO 36 ( vehicle control ) , 5 µM VAS2870 ( Enzo Life Sciences , Farmingdale , NY ) or 5µM celastrol ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) dissolved in L15 - ASW medium were sequentially applied to live neurons , while cells were observed with a 60x 1 . 4 NA oil objective ( plus 1 . 5x magnification ) using a Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope ( Nikon , Melville , NY ; ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . An OG590 long - pass red filter ( Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) was used to eliminate shorter wavelengths harmful in live cell imaging . Each drug was pre - incubated for 5 min before differential interference contrast ( DIC ) time - lapse imaging at 10 second intervals was performed . VAS2870 and celastrol were applied for a total of 20 min . The drug was then washed out with fresh L15 - ASW . For retrograde flow analysis , three kymographs of DIC time - lapse sequences were constructed from each growth cone using line scans across the peripheral ( P ) domain using MetaMorph 7 software ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA ) . Retrograde flow rates of individual growth cones were determined by averaging 5 velocity measurements from each kymograph . Neurite outgrowth experiments were carried out as described previously ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . Neurons were imaged in L15 - ASW medium 4 hours after plating using a 10x phase objective . The medium was then replaced with L15 - ASW medium containing 0 . 05 % DMSO or 2 . 5µM VAS2870 or 1µM celastrol . Cells were then incubated at 14°C for 24 hours prior to a second round of imaging . Drugs were then washed out extensively with fresh L15 - ASW and cells were incubated at 14°C for an additional 24 hours prior to the collection of a final set of images . Total neurite length was calculated by summing the lengths of all neurites per cell . Only cells with total neurite length of ≥ 50µm were included in the analysis . 37 2 . 2 . 3 Immunolabeling and fluorescent imaging After 1d in culture , bag cell neurons were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde / 400mM sucrose / ASW , pH 7 . 6 for 20 min at room temperature ( RT ) . Following fixation , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % saponin in fixation solution for 15 min . After three washes with PBS / 0 . 01 % saponin , cells were incubated with 2 units / ml ( 1 : 100 ) Alexa 488 - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) in PBS / 0 . 01 % saponin for 20 min . Following three washes , cells were blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS / 0 . 01 % saponin for 30 min . For detection of NOX2 , the rabbit anti - gp91 phox antibody R2085 was incubated at 1 : 500 in blocking solution for 1h . This antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to AA 548 - 560 in human gp91 phox ( Quinn et al . , 1989 ) . For peptide blocking experiments we used the human NOX2 548 - 560 peptide KQSISNSESGPRG or the corresponding Aplysia NOX2 peptide KHCNRFSSSESK ( XP _ 005090645 ) . The NOX2 antibody was diluted at 1 : 500 in blocking solution together with the same dilution of either the human or Aplysia peptide ( 10 mg / ml stock ; Genscript , Piscataway , NJ ) over night at 4  C before the antibody was applied to fixed neurons . A mouse anti - p40 phox was used at a 1 : 200 dilution in blocking solution for 1 h at RT . This antibody was raised against full length human p40 phox ( Gauss et al . , 2002 ) . apCAM was detected with the monoclonal antibody 4E8 diluted to 10 µg / ml in blocking solution ( Suter et al . , 1998 ) . Following three washes , primary antibodies were detected by applying either 4 µg / ml Alexa 568 or Alexa 647 labeled goat - anti - rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) in the same blocking solution for 30 min at RT . Fluorescent images were acquired in 20 mM n - propyl - gallate in PBS / 80 % glycerol pH 8 . 5 on a Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope equipped with a 60X 1 . 4 NA oil 38 ( plus 1 . 5x magnification ) objective , an X - cite 120 metal halide lamp ( EXFO , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) , appropriate fluorescence filter sets ( Chroma , Bellows Falls , VT ) , Cascade II cooled CCD camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) and MetaMorph 7 software ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA ) . Neuronal cell bodies were imaged by acquiring z - stacks with 10µm intervals on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with 488 , 568 and 610 nm lasers and appropriate filters . 2 . 2 . 4 ROS imaging For quantitative ROS imaging , we used a hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) - specific fluorescent dye Peroxyfluor - 6 acetoxymethyl ester ( PF - 6 ) kindly provided to us by Dr . Christopher Chang , University of California , Berkeley CA ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) . After one day in culture , growth cones were incubated for 20 min in the dark with artificial seawater ( ASW ) containing 5µM PF - 6 ( for H 2 O 2 detection ) together with 250nM Calcein Red - Orange AM ( Invitrogen ) , a cell permeable fluorescent dye used as volume marker for ratiometric imaging ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Three washes with ASW were performed to remove free dye . Pre - treatment images ( time 0 ) were captured using a Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope using a 480 nm excitation and 535 nm emission filter for PF - 6 and a 575nm excitation and 610nm emission filter for Calcein Red - Orange . The growth cones were then treated with ASW containing 0 . 1 % DMSO , 0 . 1 µM phorbol 12 , 13 - dibutyrate ( PDBu ; a protein kinase C activator ) , 5 µM VAS2870 or a combination of PDBu and VAS for up to 15 min before a second set of images were taken of the same growth cones . 39 Average fluorescent intensities of both PF - 6 and Calcein Red - Orange signals were measured in three regions in the growth cone periphery and then background - subtracted using MetaMorph software . Each PF - 6 and Calcein Red - Orange growth cone measurement was then normalized by the average DMSO control value at the same time point to correct for experimental variability . The DMSO - normalized signals were then volume - corrected by dividing PF - 6 values by the corresponding Calcein Red - Orange values . Volume - corrected PF - 6 signals were calculated as percent changes of H 2 O 2 levels at specific time points by dividing each value by the time 0 value . 2 . 2 . 5 Image Processing , Fluorescence Intensity and Colocalization Analysis Photoshop CS3 extended ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) was used for image processing and making videos . Canvas X ( ACD Systems of America , Inc , Miami , FL ) was used for final figure assembly . For quantification of NOX2 and p40 phox signals , the average NOX2 and p40 phox fluorescence intensities per unit area was determined in the growth cone P domain using MetaMorph 7 . 0 . For quantification of p40 phox colocalization with NOX2 or F - actin , each signal was thresholded at the level of the average intensity plus 10 % for a given area . After thresholding , the colocalization analysis function in MetaMorph was used to determine the % area overlap of p40 phox with either NOX2 or F - actin or the % area overlap of NOX2 with either p40 phox or F - actin . 40 2 . 2 . 6 Statistical Analysis Quantified data are presented as mean values ± SEM . STATISTICA 10 Academic software ( StatSoft , Inc . , Tulsa , OK ) was used for statistical data analysis . Significant differences between two conditions were determined with Student’s t - tests if data showed normal distribution . Comparison of multiple conditions was performed with a one - way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 post - hoc test . Significance levels were labeled as follows : * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . 2 . 3 Methods for Chapter 4 2 . 3 . 1 Quantitative PCR Total RNA was isolated from 12 , 24 , 36 and 48 hpf embryos with TRIzol reagent ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . 36 and 48 hpf embryos were anesthetized with 0 . 016 % Tricaine methanesulfonate ( Sigma ) prior to RNA isolation . First - strand cDNA was prepared using the polyA primers supplied in the SuperScript®III First - Strand Synthesis System ( Life Technologies ) . Primer sets against nox1 , nox2 / cybb , nox5 , and duox , β - actin and ribosomal protein L13a were designed to target exons using ProbeFinder software ( version 2 . 50 , Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) . See Table 2 . 1 for a summary of primer sequences . For each gene and each stage , samples were analyzed in three independent wells in a single 96 - well plate . The experiment was repeated with two 41 biological replicates of total RNA isolated from independent cohorts of embryos . Samples were run in a LightCycler96 ( Roche Diagnostics , USA ) for 35 cycles , and the relative expression levels were analyzed with the accompanying software ( version 1 . 0 . 0 . 1240 ; RRID : rid _ 000088 ) . Relative expression levels were calculated using the cumulative ratio of the cycle threshold of the target gene to the cycle threshold of two reference genes ( rpl13a and beta - actin ) . These two genes were chosen as they show the most consistent expression pattern of commonly used reference genes ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . These calculated values were then normalized against the relative expression value for nox2 / cybb at 12 hpf . nox2 / cybb was chosen for normalization because of the stability of expression throughout the testing period . One - way ANOVA and direct comparisons via Dunnett’s post - hoc analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism software version 6 . 05 ( RRID : rid _ 000081 ) .

Primers used for amplification are indicated in Table 2 . 2 . Probe sequences were selected by aligning the zebrafish nox genes , and identifying isoform - specific regions . Each prospective sequence was then used as the query for a BLAST search against the zebrafish RefSeq RNA database . The selected probes did not align to any other gene besides the target . The sizes of the riboprobes are as follows : nox1 - 207 nucleotides ( NM _ 001102387 . 1 position 645 - 851 ) , nox2 / cybb - 207 nucleotides ( NM _ 200414 . 1 position 719 - 925 ) , nox5 - 202 nucleotides ( XM _ 009297785 . 1 position 512 - 713 ) and duox - 1000 nucleotides ( XM _ 001919359 . 5 position 1013 - 2012 ) . Probe - containing vectors were then linearized , and riboprobes synthesized using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit ( Roche Diagnostics ) and purified with 4M LiCl ( Sigma ) precipitation . The in situ hybridization protocol was adapted from previous reports ( Thisse and Thisse , 2008 ; Hensley et al . , 2011 ) . Whole - embryos were anesthetized in 0 . 016 % Tricaine methanesulfonate ( Sigma ) at 24 , 36 and 48 hpf before fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( Sigma ) . Samples from the same time - point were processed together . The samples were then dehydrated stepwise in methanol ( 30 % , 50 % 70 % , 100 % ) , digested with 10 µg / mL Proteinase K ( Worthington Biochemical Corp . , Lakewood , NJ ) for 5 min ( 24 hpf ) , 12 min ( 36 hpf ) or 20 min ( 48 hpf ) , and pre - hybridized in hybridization buffer ( 50 % formamide , 5x saline sodium citrate ( SSC ) , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , 5 mg / mL torula RNA , 50 µg / mL heparin ) overnight at 65°C . Embryos were 43 then incubated overnight with 100 ng of riboprobe in 0 . 5 mL of hybridization buffer at 65°C . Excess and imperfectly bound probes were then removed by washing twice with 50 % formamide / 2x SSCT ( SSC , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) at 65°C , once in 2x SSCT and twice in 0 . 2x SSCT . Finally , embryos were washed twice with PBST ( 1x PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) . Anti - digoxigenin ( DIG ) antibodies ( Roche Diagnostics ) were pre - adsorbed by diluting 1 : 1000 in blocking solution ( 2 mg / mL bovine serum albumin , 2 % normal sheep serum , 1x PBST ) containing ≥ 50 embryos of various stages overnight at 4°C on a shaker . RNA - hybridized embryos were incubated in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature . DIG - containing riboprobes were labeled overnight at 4°C on a rocker with pre - adsorbed anti - DIG antibody diluted 1 : 3 in blocking solution . Excess antibody was removed with five washes in PBST and three washes in staining buffer ( 100 mM Tris pH 9 . 5 , 50 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , 1 mM levamisol ) . The colorimetric reaction was carried out by incubation in nitro blue tetrazolium / 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - phosphate ( Sigma ) diluted in water at room temperature until slight color was visible in the sense control samples . The incubation times were kept consistent among time points for each gene ( nox1 for 3 h , cybb for 3 h , nox5 for 4 h and duox for 2 . 5 h ) . Non - specific signals were washed out with a series of methanol washes ( 30 % , 50 % 70 % , 100 % ) and a two - min incubation in benzyl alcohol / benzyl benzoate solution ( 2 : 1 ) . Finally , the destained embryos were rehydrated with a series of methanol washes ( 100 % , 70 % 50 % , 30 % ) and three washes in PBST . Labeled embryos were stored in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C and imaged as whole - mounts on a microscope slide in 3 % methylcellulose using an Olympus SZX16 stereo microscope ( Olympus Corp . , Center Valley , PA ) with an SDF PLAPO 1xPF 44 objective prior to being embedded in blocks of Tissue Freezing Media ( Triangle Biosciences , Cincinnati , OH ) . A series of 10 µm transverse sections was collected from the most anterior region of the embryo through the spinal cord using a Leica CM 1510S cryostat ( Leica Biosystems , Buffalo Grove , IL ) . Sections were mounted on microscope slides in VectaMount permanent mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . Cryosections were imaged on an Olympus BX51 upright microscope at with UPlanFL 10x / 0 . 3 and UPlanS Apo 20x / 0 . 75 objectives , respectively ( Olympus Corp . ) . Images from both microscopes were captured using a SPOT RT3 2 . 0Mp Slider CCD camera ( SPOT Imaging Solutions , Sterling Heights , MI ) . At minimum , five individual samples were processed for each gene and time - point combination . Table 2 . 2 : PCR primers used to amplify in situ probes Gene IDs are taken from GenBank .

Embryos were then maintained at 28°C until they reached 32 hpf ( prim - 16 stage ) . E3 media was then replaced with media containing 2 . 5µM celastrol ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) dissolved in DMSO . Control embryos received media containing 0 . 1 % DMSO alone . Embryos were then returned to the incubator for 4 hours after which they were washed extensively with fresh E3 media . Following drug treatment , embryos were returned to the incubator and maintained in E3 media containing 0 . 003 % PTU . 2 . 4 . 2 Immunolabeling At the indicated stages , samples were anesthetized in 0 . 016 % tricaine and fixed overnight in 4 % PFA / 1x PBS at 4°C . All steps were carried out in 1 . 5mL microcentrifuge tubes unless specified otherwise . Embryos were then washed twice with 0 . 5mL PBT ( 1x PBS , 0 . 5 % TritonX - 100 ) at RT for ten minutes per wash . Next , samples were incubated in pre - chilled acetone for 30 ( 48 hpf ) , 40 ( 72 hpf ) , 50 ( 96 hpf ) or 60 minutes ( 120 hpf ) at - 20°C . Samples were then washed four times with 0 . 5mL PBT for five minutes per wash . Samples were then incubated with 10µg / mL Proteinase K ( dissolved in PBT ) at RT ( Worthington Biochemical Corp . ) . Proteinase K digestion times were 10 ( 48 hpf ) , 15 ( 72 46 hpf ) , 20 ( 96 hpf ) or 30 minutes ( 120 hpf ) . Embryos were then post - fixed in 4 % PFA / 1x PBS for 30 minutes , and washed four times with 0 . 5mL PBT for 30 minutes per wash . Samples were then incubated with blocking solution ( 10 % goat serum in PBT ; Sigma ) for 2 hours at RT . Mouse monoclonal antibody against zebrafish alcama , zn - 8 ( Zebrafish International Resource Center [ ZIRC ] , Eugene , OR ) , was diluted 1 : 500 in blocking solution and spun at max speed for 30 minutes at RT . Samples were then incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C . The following day , samples were washed four times with 0 . 5mL PBT for one hour per wash . Secondary antibody , goat anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 488 ( Thermo Fisher , Rockford , IL ) , was diluted 1 : 500 in blocking solution . The nuclear counterstain diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) was added to the secondary solution at a 1 : 500 ratio ( Thermo Fisher ) . Samples were incubated overnight in secondary antibody solution at 4°C . The following day , samples were washed four times with 0 . 5mL PBT for one hour per wash and stored at 4°C in the dark . Immunolabeled samples were positioned on coverslips in 1 % low melting point agarose dissolved in 1x PBS as described in section 2 . 1 . 2 . A microscope slide was prepared by filling a grease ring with 70 % glycerol / 1x PBS . The coverslip containing samples was then inverted onto the microscope slide , and pressed down to seal onto the grease ring . Excess 70 % glycerol / 1x PBS was aspirated and the slide was cleaned with glass cleaner . Z - stacks were collected at 1µm intervals using a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 40x LD C - Apochromat 1 . 1 NA W Korr M27 objective ( Zeiss USA , Thornwood , NY ) . Panels showing zn - 8 labeling are maximum intensity projections while DAPI panels show a single optical section . Maximum intensity projections were created using ImageJ software ( Schneider et al . , 47 2012 ) and additional image processing was performed with Photoshop CS3 extended ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) . 2 . 4 . 3 Live - imaging of transgenic lines We used Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) embryos to visualize RGCs and RGC axons in live embryos ( Poggi et al . , 2005 ) . Samples were anesthetized in 0 . 016 % tricaine methanesulfonate ( Sigma ) and mounted in 1 % low melting point agarose on 35mm glass - bottom dishes . Dishes were then filled with E3 media containing 1x tricaine . Images were acquired from the anterior perspective showing the eyes and optic chiasm on a Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope equipped with a 10x Plan Fluor 0 . 3 NA oil objective , an X - cite 120 metal halide lamp ( EXFO ) , appropriate fluorescence filter sets ( Chroma ) , Cascade II cooled EM - CCD camera ( Photometrics ) and MetaMorph 7 . 8 software ( Molecular Devices ) . Dorsal images showing the optic tecta were collected on a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 20x Plan - Apochromat 0 . 8 NA M2 objective ( Zeiss USA ) . For multi - day imaging , embryos were removed from agarose with a scalpel and forceps and maintained in 24 - well plates at 28°C . The embryos were then remounted as described each subsequent day . 2 . 4 . 4 Hydrogen peroxide rescue In celastrol - treated embryos , 2mM H 2 O 2 was applied immediately following drug washout ( section 2 . 4 . 1 ) . Samples were maintained in H 2 O 2 - containing media until harvest . 48 We chose not to co - incubate celastrol and H 2 O 2 due to possible complications arising from the direct oxidation of celastrol which may interfere with activity . gRNA - injected embryos were maintained in media containing 2mM H 2 O 2 from injection to harvest . We tested the effects of prolonged exposure to H 2 O 2 concentrations ranging from 1 - 5mM H 2 O 2 . Using Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) embryos , we found that concentrations less then 2 . 5mM did not affect embryonic survival , morphology or optic nerve outgrowth ( see Figure 5 . 2 ) . We did find that H 2 O 2 - treated embryos showed more melanization compared to non - H 2 O 2 exposed groups even when treated with 0 . 003 % PTU . At later stages , this increased pigment caused dark spots in fluorescent images . This can be observed in Fig . 5 . 3H” . 2 . 4 . 5 gRNA design and synthesis gRNAs were designed with software from Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( http : / / crispr . mit . edu / ) that generates a list of scored candidate gRNAs as well as a list of scored potential off - target regions . Scores range from 0 - 100 with 100 being the top score . The algorithm used to calculate scores is not available , but it is clear that gRNAs with few , poorly matched off - targets have the best scores . Off - target scoring is determined by the number and position of mismatches . The higher the off - target score , the higher probability that the gRNA will bind . Coding sequences from the each of the zebrafish nox genes were input into the software to generate a list of candidate gRNAs . Each was then evaluated for their location in the target gene and the probability of off - target binding . We identified two gRNAs per isoform targeting early regions of the coding sequence and with a score ≥ 95 ( Table 2 . 3 and shown in Fig . 5 . 3A & 7 . 2 ) . In order for a gRNA to be 49 chosen , it’s predicted off - target sites met the following criteria : score ≤ 0 . 5 , ≥ 2 mismatches in the 11 nucleotides adjacent to the protospacer adjacent motif ( PAM ) , ≥ 4 mismatches overall and ≤ 2 predicted exonic off - targets . These strict parameters were chosen to minimize the probability of off - target mutagenesis . A summary of the predicted off - target sites for each gRNA is given in Table 2 . 4 . Table 2 . 3 : gRNAs targeting zebrafish nox genes gRNA sequences are listed along with the protospacer adjacent motif ( PAM ) . Ideal PAM sites should are ‘NGG’ . Scores were assigned by the design software . Gene IDs refer to GenBank accession numbers . We then used a set of zebrafish codon optimized plasmid constructs to transcribe the gRNAs and Cas9 mRNA ( Jao et al . , 2013 ) . The full protocol for plasmid construction is given at http : / / www . addgene . org / crispr / Chen . Forward and reverse oligos matching the gRNA sequences shown in Table 2 . 3 were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) . TAGGN 18 was added to the forward strand and AAACN 18 was added to the reverse strand to facilitate cloning . 2µL of 100mM stock from the forward and reverse oligos was combined with 2µL NEBuffer 1 ( New England Biolabs , Ipswitch , MA ) and 14µL ultrapure water . The tube was then heated in a thermal cycler to 95°C for 5 minutes , ramped down to 50°C for 10 minutes and held at 4°C . gRNA Sequence ( 5 ' - 3 ' ) PAM Score Gene ID Chr . nox1 I GGGAAAGGGATTAAGGTAAG TGG 96 nox1 II GGTTTAGTTTTCCACGGCGC AGG 98 nox2 / cybb I GGAAACTTTGCTGCAAATGA AGG 97 nox2 / cybb II GGATTGGTGCTTCATGGAAT CGG 97 nox5 I GGTGACCCATTCCAGCCAGC GGG 99 nox5 II GGGAGATCGCACTCTCTCGC AGG 96 duox I GGTGCTGATCCTCCGAGGGT TGG 95 duox II GGCAGACTGGGACACGAGCA CGG 99 565097 25 555604 14 393386 11 100149800 25 50 Annealed oligos were cloned into the pT7 - gRNA vector ( Cat . 46759 ; Addgene , Cambridge , MA ) by combining the following : 1 µl annealed oligos , 400ng pT7 - gRNA vector , 1µl 10x NEBuffer 3 , 1µl 10x T4 ligase Buffer , 0 . 5µl BsmBI , 0 . 3µl BglII , 0 . 3µl SalI , 0 . 5µl of T4 DNA ligase , and water to a total of 10µl . All buffers and enzymes were from NEB . The single - step digestion and ligation was carried out in a thermal cycler with three cycles of 20 minutes at 37°C and 15 minutes at 16°C . Samples were then incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C , 15 minutes at 55°C , and 15 minutes at 80°C . The product was transformed into lab - made , chemically competent E . coli ( DH5 - alpha strain ) according to the following protocol . 50µL of cells were thawed for < 5 minutes on ice . 2µL of the ligated gRNA vector was added to the cells and then incubated for 30 minutes on ice . Cells were then heat shocked in a water bath at 42°C for 30 seconds and returned to ice for 5 minutes . Cells were diluted in 300µL of pre - warmed SOC media and incubated at 37°C on a shaker for 1 hour . 50 - 100µL of the cell suspension was plated onto LB plates containing 50µg / mL carbenicillin ( Sigma ) and incubated at 37°C overnight . The following day , single colonies were picked and growth in 3mL liquid cultures overnight . DNA was isolated using the Wizard SV plus miniprep system ( Promega ) , and analyzed via restriction digest and Sanger sequencing . pCS2 - nls - zCas9 - nls plasmid ( Addgene Cat . 47929 ) was also transformed into bacteria and isolated via miniprep . Plasmids were then linearized with BamHI ( gRNA vector ) or NotI ( Cas9 vector ) and purified using the Wizard SV PCR cleanup system ( Promega ) . Cas9 mRNA was transcribed using the mMessage mMachine SP6 kit ( Thermo Fisher ) , and gRNAs were 51 synthesized using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit ( Thermo Fisher ) . DNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop Lite ( Thermo Fisher ) . Table 2 . 4 : Potential off - target sites for gRNAs Sequences for the predicted off - target sites along with the accompanying PAM . Bold characters represent mismatches . Scores were assigned by the design software . Gene IDs refer to GenBank accession numbers , and the chromosome on which each sequence appears is given . 2 . 4 . 6 gRNA injection Microneedles were prepared by pulling 1mm borosilicate capillaries ( World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL , Cat . 1B100F - 4 ) with a single pull at 68°C on a vertical puller ( Narishige Intl . Inc . , East Meadow , NY , Model PP - 830 ) . The tips of the needles were broken with fine forceps under a stereomicroscope ( AmScope , Irvine , CA , Cat . ST - 6TP ) to a width of 5 - 10µm . The injection mix was prepared by diluting the gRNA to 90 - 120ng / µL and Cas9 mRNA to 150ng / µL in a solution containing phenol red ( 1 : 10 , Sigma ) as a tracer . The injection needle was filled with 1 - 2µL of injection mix using a narrow pipette tip and secured into the micromanipulator ( World Precision Instruments ) . gRNA Sequence ( 5 ' - 3 ' ) PAM Score Gene ID Chr . nox1 I A GGAAAG AT ATTAAGGT G AG GAG 0 . 2 567212 15 nox1 II GGTTT T GTTTTCC CA GGC T C CAG 0 567798 2 nox2 / cybb I G C A G ACTTT C CT C CAAATGA AGG 0 . 5 387260 8 nox2 / cybb II GGATTGG G GCTTC G TGGA GG AGG 0 393852 7 nox5 I GGT CT CCCA C TCC T GCCAGC AAG 0 . 2 568565 20 nox5 II G T GAGATCGCA G TC C CTCG A AAG 0 . 1 368662 2 duox I G A TGCTG T TCCTCCGA T GG A CAG 0 . 3 563429 5 duox II GG GG GACTG C GA A ACGAGCA GAG 0 . 5 368415 12 52 Embryos were collected as described in section 2 . 1 . 1 , and transferred to injection molds consisting of 1 . 5 % agarose in E3 . One nanoliter of a mix containing 90 - 120ng / µL gRNA and 150ng / µL Cas9 mRNA was injected into single - cell embryos . After injection , the embryos were collected in petri dishes and maintained at 28°C . Dead embryos were removed the following day and media was changed daily . 2 . 4 . 7 Genotyping Genomic DNA was isolated from 72 hpf tail biopsies ( Wilkinson et al . , 2013 ) or whole embryos ( Meeker et al . , 2007 ) . Tail biopsies were performed by first anesthetizing embryos in 0 . 016 % Tricaine . Embryos were then placed onto the lid of a petri dish , and a small region of the tail was cut with a clean scalpel . The embryo was then placed into one well of a 24 - well plate filled with fresh E3 for recovery . The tail biopsy was transferred into a 0 . 5mL tube containing 13 . 5µL of 50mM NaOH with a clean 10µL pipette . Fish can be maintained in the 24 - well plate up to 5 days post - fertilization . Whole embryos were anesthetized and directly dissolved in 50mM NaOH . In either case , samples in 50mM NaOH were incubated for 10 minutes at 95°C . One - tenth volume of 1M Tris HCl pH 8 . 0 was added to neutralize , and the samples were stored at - 20°C . DNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop Lite ( Thermo Scientific , Wilmington , DE ) . 5 - 10ng of DNA was used for PCR amplification using GoTaq Flexi polymerase ( Promega ) . 53 Table 2 . 5 : PCR primers for genotyping Genotyping was done using a gel based method that was previously published ( Zhu et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , gRNA target regions were amplified via PCR using the primers listed in Table 3 . Following PCR amplification , samples were heated to 95°C and allowed to cool for 10 minutes at RT . Samples were then loaded onto a 15 % acrylamide gel ( 29 : 1 acrylamide : bis ratio , Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) without SDS and run for 2 . 5 hours at 150V . Gels were stained with 50µg / mL ethidium bromide ( Sigma ) for 10 minutes to visualize DNA bands . Heteroduplexes indicative of heterozygous mutants or chimeras exhibited slower electrophoretic mobility as described previously ( Zhu et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , we were able to reliably distinguish wild type and homozygous mutants due to the electrophoretic shift as a result of DNA deletions ( data not shown ; see Fig . 4A for a mutant sequences ) . For each set of PCR primers , the gel - based method described here was initially verified with Sanger sequencing to ensure reliability . gRNA PCR primer sequence ( 5 ' - 3 ' ) Product length ( bp ) ACA GTT TAG AGG GTG AAG AC CTC TGA CAG GAC TGG TTT A GTA CAC GCA TCA CCT CTT C TTG GAC GAA AGC GTC TG CCC GAT AGC TTA CGA TAA CAA A CTC TCG ATC TCA TCT CCT GAT GAA TAG AAG CAA ACC CTC ACC GTC ATC CGA AGG TCC TAC TT AATTTCACCCCTCACCATCC GACATGTTTCTTCTGACACAAC AAT GTG ATG GAG CCA CTG CTA TAG ACC CAG ATG AGT TGC TCT CTG GTC CGT CTG TAT C ACG CTT CTG TTC TTG TGG GTC TCC AAC TCT TCA CAG C GTA TAC ACG CAC CTG TGT C nox2 / cybb II 109 nox5 I 903 nox1 I 143 nox1 II 139 nox2 / cybb I 105 duox I 143 duox II 105 nox5 II 142 54 2 . 4 . 8 Generation of stable mutant lines NOX2 / CYBB gRNAs and Cas9 mRNA was injected into embryos from a cross of AB strain , wild type fish . The injected embryos were genotyped via tail biopsy , and mutants were raised to adulthood . Adult injectants were outcrossed with an unrelated AB line , and the resultant embryos were again genotyped via tail biopsy at 72 hpf . DNA from heterozygotes showing the formation of heteroduplexes on acrylamide gels was re - amplified and purified with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean - Up System ( Promega ) . Purified DNA was then cloned into the pGEM - T Easy vector ( Promega ) for sequencing . Mutant sequences were confirmed with at least three technical replicates showing the same mutation from an individual larva . We then used Vector NTI ( Thermo Fisher ) to determine the resulting amino acid sequences , and these were aligned to the wild type protein sequences . Heterozygous larva carrying mutations leading to truncated NOX2 / CYBB proteins were used to found lines by outcrossing with AB strains to achieve a stable population of nox2 / cybb + / - adults . nox2 / cybb - / - embryos were produced by crossing these heterozygous lines . Homozygous , nox2 / cybb - / - , embryos used for analysis were identified via gel - based genotyping and / or Sanger sequencing . 2 . 4 . 9 Quantification of retinal and tectal anatomy Length and area measurements were performed on raw images using MetaMorph 7 software ( Molecular Devices ) . Optic nerve thickness was measured 5 - 10µm medial to the ganglion cell layer ( Figure 5 . 1A ) . Two measurements were taken per embryo and 55 these were averaged to produce single value per sample . Area of the GCL was measured from single images ( Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) ) or max intensity projections from 10 , 1µm optical sections centered on the optic nerve ( zn - 8 labels ) . Retinal areas were measured from phase images ( Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) ) or a single 1µm optical section from the DAPI channel centered in the optic nerve ( zn - 8 labels ) . GFP - or zn - 8 - positive area measurements were divided by the corresponding total retinal area to obtain the values reported . Again , two values were averaged per embryo . Tectal area was measured from maximum intensity projections compiled from 25 - 30 , 1µm optical sections . An example of the measured area of one tectum is shown in Figure 5 . 1I . Areas from the left and right tecta were averaged to produce a single value for each embryo . Line scans of zn - 8 fluorescent intensity in the optic tectum were performed with MetaMorph 7 software using raw , maximum intensity projections from 30 - 35 , 1µm optical sections through the midbrain . Lines were drawn from ~ 10µm outside of the sample to a depth of ~ 250µm ( 72 hpf ) or 300µm ( 120 hpf ) into the midbrain . Average intensity was collected from 25 pixels on either side of the line . Examples of the position of the line scans is shown in Figure 5A & D . Graphs of average intensity along the length of each line scan were produced using GraphPad Prism software version 6 . 05 . Integrated intensity values were calculated from the area under the curve for each condition . 2 . 4 . 10 Statistical analysis Data sets were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software version 6 . 05 ( GraphPad Software , Inc , La Jolla , CA ) . All raw data was assessed for normality using the 56 D ' Agostino - Pearson omnibus test included in GraphPad . All data displayed a normal distribution ( p ≥ 0 . 05 ) , and no transformations were necessary . Outliers were automatically identified and removed using the ROUT algorithm with a Q - value of 1 % . In all cases , ≤ 2 outliers were identified per group . Since all data sets contained three or more groups , one - way ANOVA was used to identify differences among means , and p - values less than 0 . 05 were considered significant . Corresponding F statistics and p - values are reported in the Results section . If a significant difference was detected with the ANOVA , the Tukey HSD method was used for multiple comparisons among groups or the Dunnett’s test was used for specific comparisons to a control . The test used is specified in the figure legend . Tukey or Dunnett’s adjusted p - values are displayed in the figures and the Results section . Graphs in Chapter 5 show mean ± standard deviation for each group . 2 . 5 Methods for Chapter 6 2 . 5 . 1 SiR - actin and SiR - tubulin labeling NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded at 3000 cells per cm 2 on uncoated 35mm glass bottom dishes . Media was DMEM ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 10 % calf serum , Pen / strep , 20mM HEPES and 20mM L - glutamine ( all from Sigma ) . The cells were allowed to adhere for 6 - 10 hours at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Once the cells start to become adherent , media was replaced with 2 - 3mL of media containing 57 SiR - actin or SiR - tubulin probes at 100 - 200nM . The dishes were then maintained in the incubator for ~ 12 hours and imaged using a Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope equipped with a 60X 1 . 4 NA oil ( plus 1 . 5x magnification ) objective , an X - cite 120 metal halide lamp ( EXFO ) , appropriate fluorescence filter sets ( Chroma ) , Cascade II cooled CCD camera ( Photometrics ) and MetaMorph 7 software ( Molecular Devices ) . 2 . 5 . 2 Dissociated neuronal culture Protocol was modified from Chen et al . 2013 . At 33 - 34 hpf embryos from the transgenic Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) line were sterilized with 70 % ethanol and then transferred to a new dish containing sterile E2 media ( 15mM NaCl , 0 . 5mM KCl , 1mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 15mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 05mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 0mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 7mM NaHCO 3 ) . Chorions were removed with sharp forceps and embryos were sacrificed by decapitation . Whole eyes were extracted , triturated 20 - 30 times in L15 media ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 2 % FBS , 0 . 4 % pen / strep , and 12 . 5 % saline solution ( 10 mM D - glucose , 5 mM Na - pyruvate , 1 . 26 mM CaCl 2 , and 32 mM HEPES , all from Sigma ) Individual cells were then plated on coverslips pre - coated with 0 . 5 mg / ml poly - D - lysine ( 70 - 150 kDa ) ( Sigma ) and 20 µg / ml laminin ( Sigma ) . Cells were maintained in supplemented L15 medium overnight at room temperature . 58 2 . 5 . 3 Measurements of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons For live - cell imaging , coverslips containing overnight retinal cultures were transferred from culture dishes to a custom - made open imaging chamber described previously ( Suter , 2011 ) . Prior to imaging , media was replaced with serum - free L15 . Imaging was performed with the Nikon TE2000 Eclipse microscope and Cascade II cooled CCD camera described above . A 60x 1 . 4 NA oil objective ( Nikon ) and an OG590 long - pass red filter ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) were also used for this set of experiments . Media was replaced with 1 - 2mL of serum - media containing nerve growth factor ( NGF , 20ng / mL ) , netrin - 1 ( Netrin , 250ng / mL ) and semaphorin 3E ( Sema3E , 5µg / mL ) . Controls received fresh serum - free media . After a 15 minute pre - incubation , initial DIC images were acquired ( time 0 minutes ) . Additional images were acquired at 20 , 40 and 60 minutes . Using MetaMorph 7 . 8 software , neurite lengths were measured from the base of the cell body to the tip of the growth cone lamellipodia on cells having processes ≥ 15µm . Neurite growth rates of individual cells were determined by subtracting the length at time 0 from the length at time 60 and dividing the difference by the elapsed time . 59 2 . 6 Methods for Chapter 7 2 . 6 . 1 Microangiography Methods are adapted from published protocols ( Hoffman et al . , 2012 ) . A detailed protocol can be found at : http : / / zfish . nichd . nih . gov / Intro % 20Page / angiography . html . Embryos were collected as described in section 2 . 1 . 1 . Microneedles were prepared by pulling 1mm borosilicate capillaries ( World Precision Instruments ) with a single pull at 68°C on a Narishige puller ( Model PP - 830 ) . The tips of the needles were then broken with fine forceps under a stereomicroscope to a width of 5 - 10µm . Holding pipets were prepared by flame polishing 1mm capillaries in a Bunsen burner to a width of 0 . 2 - 0 . 5mm depending on the age of the embryos being injected . The injection mixture was prepared by dissolving 3kDa dextran - Texas Red ( 10 % w / w ; Thermo Fisher ) in nanopure water containing 1 % BSA . The solution was spun at maximum speed for 20 minutes , and the supernatant was distributed into 5µL aliquots and frozen at - 20°C . On the day of the injection , embryos were removed from chorions using sharp forceps and anesthetized in 0 . 016 % Tricaine diluted in E3 media . The injection apparatus was assembled as shown in Figure 2 . 1 . The holding pipet was secured into a micromanipulator ( World Precision Instruments ) on the left , and attached to a 1mL syringe . The injection needle was filled with 1 - 2µL of injection mix and secured in the micromanipulator on the right . The injection volume was calibrated to < 1nL in mineral oil by delivering short pulses with a pneumatic PicoPump with a foot pedal attachment ( World Precision Instruments ) . An embryo was positioned with the lateral side of the 60 yolk touching the opening of the holding pipette . A small amount of suction was applied with the 1mL syringe to immobilize the embryo such that the ventral side is up . It is critical not to apply too much suction as this will destroy the embryo . Once secured , the needle was inserted into the sinus venosus and 1 - 2 small boluses are injected . The dye should be observed entering the heart , not the pericardium , and the injections may cause temporary cardiac arrest . If the heartbeat has not resumed within a few seconds , the embryo was discarded . Once the cardiac rhythm was established , dye was quickly injected 15 - 20 more times while ensuring that the heart continues to beat and the dye is moving through the bloodstream . The embryo was then released from the holding pipette by application of negative pressure and transferred to a dish containing fresh E3 for recovery . The injection was then repeated for the remaining embryos . Figure 2 . 1 : Microangiography setup ( A ) Photo showing the entire injection setup for microangiography . Injection needle is connected to a pneumatic PicoPump ( not shown ) . Holding pipette connects to the 1mL syringe to apply pressure to immobilize embryos . ( B ) Higher magnification view of the injection dish showing the positions of the holding pipette and injection needle . Once all the injection are complete ( no more then 20 - 30 minutes ) , the embryos are again anesthetized in 0 . 016 % Tricaine methanesulfonate and mounted in 1 % low 61 melting point agarose on 35mm glass - bottom dishes . Dishes were then filled with E3 media containing 0 . 016 % Tricaine methanesulfonate . Z - stacks were collected at 1µm intervals using a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 20x Plan - Apochromat 0 . 8 NA M2 objective or a 40x LD C - Apochromat 1 . 1 NA W Korr M27 objective ( Zeiss USA ) . Maximum intensity projections were created using ImageJ software ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) and additional image processing was performed with Photoshop CS3 extended ( Adobe ) . 2 . 6 . 2 Alcian blue staining Methods were adapted from a protocol published in 2007 ( Walker and Kimmel , 2007 ) An updated , detailed protocol is available here : https : / / wiki . zfin . org / pa ges / viewpage . action ? pageId = 13107315 . 2 % Alcian blue stock was prepared by dissolving 0 . 2g of Alican blue powder ( Sigma ) in 11 . 2mL of 50 % ethanol . The solution was warmed and stirred gently for 30 - 60 minutes to allow the powder to dissolve completely . Once all of the powder dissolved , the solution was brought to 100mL with 95 % ethanol . 10mL aliquots of the 2 % stock were stored in parafilm - sealed 15mL conical tubes at room temperature . The parafilm is necessary to prevent evaporation . 5 day old embryos were anesthetized in 0 . 016 % Tricaine methanesulfonate then fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 1x PBS for 1 hour at room temperature . All steps were performed in 1 . 5mL centrifuge tubes . Embryos were washed twice for 10 minutes each in a solution containing 100mM Tris pH 7 . 5 and 10mM MgCl 2 . The staining solution ( 0 . 04 % Alcian blue , 10mM MgCl 2 ) was prepared by combining 10mL of 2 % Alcian blue stock 62 with 5mL 1M Tris pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5mL 1M MgCl2 , 32 . 6mL 95 % ethanol and 1 . 9mL water . Wash solutions were replaced with 1mL staining solution , and the tubes were incubated overnight with gentle agitation at room temperature . The next day , embryos were washed for 5 minutes with 100mM Tris pH 7 . 5 / 10mM MgCl 2 / 80 % ethanol . This was followed by one 5 minute wash in 50 % ETOH / 100mM Tris pH 7 . 5 and a final wash in 25 % ETOH / 100mM Tris pH 7 . 5 . After washing , 1mL of bleaching solution ( 3 % H 2 0 2 / 0 . 5 % KOH ) was added to the tubes and incubated for 10 minutes without agitation . Tube lids were left open during this incubation . After bleaching , the samples were washed extensively with 25 % glycerol / 0 . 1 % KOH until bubbles are no longer visible . Samples were then washed twice with 50 % glycerol / 0 . 1 % KOH for 10 minutes each and stored at 4°C in the final wash solution . Samples were imaged on a depression slide using an Olympus SZX16 stereo microscope ( Olympus Corp . ) with an SDF PLAN APO 1x objective at 3 . 2x magnification . Image processing was performed using Photoshop CS3 extended software . Pharyngeal arch labels in Figure 7 . 4 are derived from published literature ( Schilling et al . , 1996 ) . 63 CHAPTER 3 . LOCALIZATION AND FUNCTION OF NOX IN NEURONAL GROWTH CONES This work described in this chapter was previously published . The text presented here is adapted , with permission , from the original publication to highlight my individual contributions ( Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) . 3 . 1 Introduction As introduced in Chapter 1 , this study is focused on the role of NOX enzymes in the growth and development of axons . One critical component of axon outgrowth is regulation of the cytoskeleton to drive leading edge protrusion . There is little known about the ways in which NOX - derived ROS contribute to axon outgrowth and neurite extension . A recent study found that NOX2 inhibition led to alteration in mouse hippocampal neuronal maturation , and neurite extension ( Wilson et al . , 2015 ) . This certainly suggests that NOX2 plays a positive role in the regulation and promotion of neurite outgrowth in these cells . What that study lacks is a detailed description of the subcellular localization of NOX2 subunits . This is important since as I introduced in the previous chapter , one way to regulate ROS - mediated signaling is to maintain ROS production and downstream effectors in close approximation within the cell . Studies of 64 NOX subcellular localization may yield insights into downstream ROS effectors and signaling . With the dearth of localization and functional studies focused on NOX enzymes in neurons , it is necessary to turn instead to non - neuronal cells . NOX subunits have previously been identified at sites relevant to adhesion and cell migration including focal adhesions and leading edge protrusions in non - neuronal cells ( Ushio - Fukai , 2006 ) . NOX - derived ROS have been implicated in fibroblast cell adhesion and ( Chiarugi et al . , 2003 ) migration in endothelial cells ( Moldovan et al . , 2000 ; Ushio - Fukai et al . , 2002 ; Ikeda et al . , 2005 ) , HeLa cells ( Nimnual et al . , 2003 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ) , smooth muscle cells ( Schroder et al . , 2007 ; Lee et al . , 2009 ) and keratinocytes ( Kim et al . , 2011a ) . Despite the many similarities between cell migration and neurite outgrowth , the role of NOX in the latter process is largely unexplored . As introduced in Chapter 1 , NADPH oxidase family members NOX1 , NOX2 , NOX3 , and NOX4 are expressed in different portions of the nervous system , particularly in neurons and microglia ( Sorce and Krause , 2009 ; Hernandes and Britto , 2012 ) . Also reviewed in Chapter 1 , NADPH oxidase - derived ROS have been implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation ( Kishida et al . , 2006 ) , NMDA receptor activation ( Brennan et al . , 2009 ) , nerve growth factor induced neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of PC - 12 cells ( Suzukawa et al . , 2000 ; Ibi et al . , 2006 ) , and neuronal apoptosis ( Tammariello et al . , 2000 ; Guemez - Gamboa and Moran , 2009 ) . On the other hand , microglial cells and proinflammatory cytokine - treated neurons release NADPH oxidase - derived superoxide leading to neuronal toxicity ( Barth et al . , 2012 ) , as described in Alzheimer ' s and Parkinson ' s disease ( Sorce and Krause , 2009 ; Gao 65 et al . , 2012 ) . We have recently reported that ROS derived from NOX regulate F - actin organization , dynamics , and neurite outgrowth ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) ; however , the exact subcellular localization and interactions of NOX with the actin cytoskeleton in neuronal growth cones have not been investigated . Here , we report on the first localization of a NOX2 - type NADPH oxidase in neuronal growth cones . NOX inhibition with VAS2870 or celastrol resulted in reduced retrograde F - actin flow and neurite outgrowth , confirming our earlier results . NADPH oxidase activation with a PKC activator resulted in increased ROS levels in the growth cone periphery . We found that the regulatory cytosolic subunit p40 phox exhibited F - actin - association in unstimulated growth cones and little co - localization with plasma membrane - bound NOX2 . Additional works presented here shows that upon growth cone stimulation with the cell adhesion protein apCAM , p40 phox and NOX2 accumulated and co - localized at adhesion sites . In summary , these findings point towards an interesting bidirectional relationship between NADPH oxidase and the actin cytoskeleton in neuronal growth cones . 3 . 2 Results 3 . 2 . 1 NADPH oxidase inhibition impacts the actin cytoskeleton and neurite outgrowth We previously reported that lowering cytosolic ROS levels in Aplysia neuronal growth cones by either a general radical scavenger , α - N - tert - butyl - phenylnitrone , or by 66 NOX inhibition via phenylarsine oxide and apocynin resulted in reduced actin content , impaired actin dynamics , and decreased neurite outgrowth ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . Phenylarsine oxide is a highly potent inhibitor , but being a vicinal dithiol - binding reagent it is not exclusively specific to NOX ( Le Cabec and Maridonneau - Parini , 1995 ; Jaquet et al . , 2009 ) . Apocynin is still widely used as NADPH oxidase inhibitor ; however , there is now evidence that it may act as antioxidant and require the presence of myeloperoxidase to function as a NADPH oxidase inhibitor ( Heumuller et al . , 2008 ; Jaquet et al . , 2009 ; Wind et al . , 2010 ) . To confirm that our previous results were indeed caused by reduced NADPH oxidase activity , we repeated oxidase inhibition experiments with one of the most specific chemical pan - NADPH oxidase inhibitors currently available , VAS2870 ( ten Freyhaus et al . , 2006 ; Wind et al . , 2010 ; Altenhofer et al . , 2012 ) . Treatment of Aplysia growth cones with 5 µM VAS2870 for 20 min reduced transition ( T ) zone ruffling , flattened the peripheral ( P ) domain , caused extension of the central ( C ) domain and filopodial lengthening when compared to DMSO control pre - treatment ( Fig . 3 . 1 A - C ) . These effects were partially reversible 60 min following drug washout ( Fig . 3 . 1D ) . NOX inhibition significantly decreased the F - actin content in T zone ruffles , as well as in filopodial actin bundles and lamellipodial actin networks in the P domain ( Fig . 3 . 1 E - H ) . Treatment with 5µM VAS2870 reduced retrograde actin flow rates by 35 % compared to DMSO pre - treatment ( Fig . 3 . 1I ; mean flow rates ± SEM were 4 . 6±0 . 1 µm / min in DMSO vs . 3 . 0±0 . 1µm / min in VAS2870 ) . Flow rates nearly recovered to control values following drug washout . Total neurite length per neuron was strongly reduced in neurons treated with 2 . 5µM VAS2870 for a 24 h when compared to medium 67 Figure 3 . 1 : NADPH oxidase inhibition reduces F - actin content in growth cones as well as neurite outgrowth ( A ) DIC image of Aplysia bag cell neuronal growth cone cultured for 1d .

( B ) Treatment with 0 . 1 % DMSO for 20 min did not noticeably affect growth cone morphology or motility . Arrow points towards T zone ruffle . ( C ) Treatment with 5µM VAS2870 for 20 min caused flattening of the T zone and P domain as well as some extension of the C domain and filopodia ( arrowhead ) . ( D ) Drug washout for 60 min partially reversed these effects , resulting in further growth cone protrusion . ( E - H ) 5µM VAS2870 for 20 min reduced F - actin content in the T zone and P domain , including in ruffles , filopodial bundles , and intervening lamellipodial networks . ( I ) NADPH oxidase inhibition by 5µM VAS2870 resulted in reduced retrograde flow rates ( Mean flow rates ± SEM ; n = 11 growth cones ; one - way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 post - hoc test ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( J ) NADPH oxidase inhibition by 2µM VAS2870 between day 0 and 1 reduced neurite outgrowth irreversibly when compared with medium or DMSO - containing medium . The drug was washed out between day 1 and day 2 .

Scale bars : 10 µm . only or DMSO control conditions ( Fig . 3 . 1J ; 81 % reduction compared to DMSO ) . Extensive drug washout over the following 24 h period did not reverse total neurite length values . This is likely due to the significantly longer drug incubation time when compared to the results of the 20 min VAS2870 treatments . Using a different NOX 68 inhibitor , celastrol ( Jaquet et al . , 2011 ) , we observed similar effects on growth cone morphology , actin flow , and neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 3 . 2A - D ) . In summary , we found that treatment of cultured Aplysia neurons with VAS2870 or celastrol resulted in similar effects as our previous approaches of NOX inhibition ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) , confirming our findings that NOX activity is critical for controlling actin organization and dynamics in growth cones as well as neurite growth .

Scale bar : 10μm . 69 3 . 2 . 2 Localization of NOX2 - type NADPH oxidase in neuronal growth cones Although NOX1 , NOX2 , and NOX4 have been previously detected in cultured cerebellar granule neurons ( Coyoy et al . , 2008 ) and NOX2 additionally in hippocampal neurons ( Tejada - Simon et al . , 2005 ; Park and Jin , 2008 ) , sympathetic neurons ( Tammariello et al . , 2000 ; Hilburger et al . , 2005 ) , and DRG neurons ( Cao et al . , 2009 ) , None of these studies investigated the localization of these enzyme complexes specifically in neuronal growth cones . A previous lab member identified a NOX2 - type NADPH oxidase complex in growth cones using antibodies raised against human homologs of the membrane - bound NOX2 ( Quinn et al . , 1989 ) and cytosolic p40 phox subunits ( Gauss et al . , 2002 ) . Western blotting of Aplysia CNS protein extracts with these antibodies detected a major band at the expected molecular weights of 75 kDa and 40 kDa , respectively ( Fig . 3 . 3A ) . NOX2 proteins run between 73 and 91 kDa on SDS - PAGE depending on the species ( Krijnen et al . , 2003 ) . The variations in molecular weight are believed to be caused by differences in glycosylation ( Quinn et al . , 1989 ; Gauss et al . , 2002 ) . To confirm the specificity of the NOX2 antibody , I preincubated the rabbit anti NOX2 antibody with either the human peptide used for raising the antibody or the corresponding Aplysia peptide . Preincubation with either of these peptides significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity in the growth cone periphery ( Fig . 3 . 3B ) . Immunolabeling of growth cones with NOX2 and p40 phox antibodies revealed a punctate pattern of both proteins within growth cones ( Fig . 3 . 3C - D ) . NOX2 labeling in the P domain is more uniform and dense than p40 phox labeling , which is expected for a plasma 70 Figure 3 . 3 : Localization of NOX2 - type NADPH oxidase complex in Aplysia growth cones ( A ) Western blot of Aplysia CNS proteins detected by NOX2 and p40 antibodies . Each antibody detects a major band at the expected molecular weights of 75 kDa and 40 kDa , respectively . ( B ) Preincubation of the polyclonal rabbit anti - NOX2 antibody with either the human ( hgp91 ) or the corresponding Aplysia peptide ( agp91 ) reduced NOX2 labeling in the P domain of Aplysia bag cell growth cones by 40 % and 28 % , respectively , when compared to PBS preincubation . ( C ) Immunolocalization in cultured Aplysia bag cell growth cones revealed homogeneous NOX2 distribution in the P domain , suggesting plasma membrane - association , while the strong C domain labeling is indicative of vesicular association . ( D ) p40 phox immunolocalization is somewhat less dense than NOX2 labeling . p40 phox is prominent in the growth cone periphery including in filopodia ( arrow ) . No labeling is found in very flat portions of the P domain ( arrowhead ) . ( D - G ) VAS2870 lowers Number of growth cones are indicated ; Student’s t - test ; * P < 0 . 05 , * * * P < 0 . 001 . Scale bars : 10 µm . membrane - associated protein . NOX2 signals were markedly higher in the C domain of the growth cone ( Fig . 3 . 3C ) compared to the P domain , which can be attributed to NOX2’s association with vesicles . In the growth cone , localization of the cytosolic p40 phox subunit differed from NOX2 in a few ways . First , p40 phox exhibited a striking array - like localization ( Fig . 3 . 3C ) , very similar to F - actin bundles in the P domain . Second , the labeling in the C domain was not increased as in the case of NOX2 . Third , 71 hardly any p40 phox was found in very thin growth cone regions that were clearly NOX2 positive ( arrowhead in Fig . 3 . 3C and 3 . 6C ) . NOX2 is expected to associate with the plasma membrane . Due to the thinness of growth cones , it is difficult to differentiate membrane associated and cytosolic proteins using immunolabeling . Instead , we found evidence for the expected plasma membrane association of NOX2 in unstimulated Aplysia neurons by confocal imaging of the large neuronal cell body ( Fig . 3 . 4A ) . p40 phox labeling was not enriched at the membrane in the cell bodies of unstimulated cells ( Fig . 3 . 4B ) . NOX2 and p40phox positive structures also colocalized with actin in some cases ( arrowheads in Fig3 . 4A’ - F’ ) . Collectively , these results demonstrate the presence of a NOX2 - like and a p40 phox - like proteins in Aplysia neurons that can be detected with specific antibodies either by Western blot or immunolabeling . 3 . 2 . 3 NOX2 produces reactive oxygen in neuronal growth cones NADPH oxidase produces superoxide , which can be converted quickly into H 2 O 2 , a ROS that has a longer half - life than superoxide and is likely involved in many ROS - mediated signaling processes ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Winterbourn , 2008 ) . We used Peroxyfluor - 6 acetoxymethyl ester ( PF - 6 ) as a H 2 O 2 - specific fluorescent dye ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) in combination with Calcein Red - Orange AM as a volume marker in order to perform ratiometric quantification of H 2 O 2 - levels in the growth cone P domain following activation and inhibition of NADPH oxidase ( Fig . 3 . 5A - D ) . PF - 6 signals were the highest in the C domain , specifically in mitochondria , a well - known intracellular ROS source , as 72 Figure 3 . 4 : NOX2 and p40 exhibit distinct subcellular localizations in the cell body ( A - C ) Immunolabeling of Nox2 ( A ) and p40 ( B ) with phalloidin labeling of f - actin ( C ) in the cell body 10µm above the focal plane of the growth cone .

Scale bar in A : 10μm , A’ : 2µm . well as in T zone ruffles . NADPH oxidase inhibition with 5µM VAS2870 reduced H 2 O 2 levels more than the control treatment with DMSO alone after 15 min ( Fig . 3 . 5E ; 30 % reduction by VAS2870 vs . 16 % reduction by DMSO ) , although these reductions were not significantly different ( Student’s t - test ; P = 0 . 12 ) . Conversely , we used the phorbol ester phorbol 12 , 13 - dibutyrate ( PDBu ) to activate PKC , which is known to stimulate activity of NADPH oxidase through phosphorylation of p47 phox ( Fontayne et al . , 2002 ) . Within 30 sec of PDBu application , H 2 O 2 - levels increased by 12±3 % . This PDBu - induced rise in H 2 O 2 - levels could be significantly decreased by co - incubation with 5µM VAS2870 to 73 levels that were similar to basal H 2 O 2 - levels ( Fig . 3 . 5F ) . In summary , these data confirm that NOX is functional in neuronal growth cones . 3 . 3 Discussion This is the first report on subcellular localization of NOX in neuronal growth cones . Expression of NOX1 - NOX4 family members at the RNA and protein levels has been shown for various brain regions including cortex , cerebellum , hippocampus , as well as for peripheral ganglia ( Sorce and Krause , 2009 ; Hernandes and Britto , 2012 ) . NOX2 subunits have been localized in cultured neurons , such as hippocampal ( Tejada - Simon et al . , 2005 ; Park and Jin , 2008 ) , cerebellar granule ( Coyoy et al . , 2008 ) , sympathetic ( Tammariello et al . , 2000 ; Hilburger et al . , 2005 ) , and DRG neurons ( Cao et al . , 2009 ) . However , most of these studies did not investigate the detailed subcellular distribution of NOX complex proteins . Here , we have shown that a NOX2 - type protein is localized to the plasma membrane of Aplysia neuronal growth cones ( Fig . 3 . 4A ) . Whether another type of NOX is also present in Aplysia growth cones remains to be investigated . NOX inhibition with VAS2870 or celastrol impaired actin organization and dynamics as well as neurite outgrowth , confirming our previous findings ( Fig . 3 . 1 & 3 . 2 ; ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . NOX activation increased H 2 O 2 levels in the growth cone P domain , and this was partially blocked by a NOX inhibitor ( Fig . 3 . 5F ) . Since p40 phox exhibited an F - actin - like distribution , previous lab members performed triple labeling with phalloidin , p40 phox , and NOX2 antibodies to determine a potential colocalization between p40 phox and F - actin . Upon analyzing this raw data , I 74 Figure 3 . 5 : Aplysia growth cones produce reactive oxygen via NOX ( A - D ) VAS2870 lowers H 2 O 2 levels in the P domain ( indicated with dashed line ) .

Volume - corrected PF - 6 signals measured after 30 sec were normalized against DMSO control values and presented as % changes of pretreatment values . PDBu increased H 2 O 2 in the growth cone periphery to levels that were significantly higher than in growth cones treated with a combination of PDBu and VAS2870 ( Average % changes in H 2 O 2 - levels ± SEM are given ; n = 32 growth cones ; one - way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 post - hoc test ; * * P < 0 . 01 ) . Scale bars : 10 µm . found that in the growth cone P domain , p40 phox signal exhibited only a partial overlap with NOX2 . 38±2 % of p40 phox colocalized with NOX2 , while 22±1 % of NOX2 overlapped with p40 phox . The highest colocalization between p40 phox and NOX2 was found in the neck of the growth cone , which consolidates into the axon , as well as in contact areas between two adjacent growth cones . p40 phox exhibited higher colocalization 75 with filopodial F - actin bundles in the growth cone periphery , when compared to NOX2 - colocalization with F - actin . Additional work performed by other lab members was included in the original publication , but I will summarize it here . They observed variations in p40 phox levels between growth cones , which correlated with F - actin content . Cytochalasin B significantly reduced the amount of p40 phox , but not NOX2 , in the growth cone periphery . Cell fractionation and actin co - immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed a partial association of p40 phox with F - actin . The cell fractionation studies were performed on total CNS lysates suggesting that the differential association of NOX2 and p40 phox not only occurs in the growth cone but also in other regions of the cell . This was supported by my data showing the differential localization of NOX2 and p40 phox in the cell body of Aplysia neurons ( Fig . 3 . 4 ) . Finally , these additional experiments found increased p40 phox / NOX2 co - localization at adhesion sites during apCAM - evoked neuronal growth . In summary , all of these findings provide evidence for a bidirectional functional relationship between NADPH oxidase activity and the actin cytoskeleton in neuronal growth cones , which may contribute to the control of neurite outgrowth . Very little is known about NADPH oxidase signaling in neuronal development , particularly in axonal growth and guidance . Previous work from our lab and others suggested a role for NADPH oxidase - derived ROS in regulating neurite outgrowth ( Suzukawa et al . , 2000 ; Ibi et al . , 2006 ; Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . A recent study showed that tail wound - derived H 2 O 2 can promote regeneration of sensory axons in Zebrafish embryos ( Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ) . Furthermore , we have shown that NADPH oxidase inhibition in Aplysia growth cones results in reduced F - actin content 76 ( this study ; Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ) . ROS have also been implicated in Rac1 - dependent Ca 2 + - release in Aplysia growth cones ( Zhang and Forscher , 2009 ) . Due to the short half - life and high reactivity of ROS , target proteins need to be close to the ROS source to establish signaling specificity ( Ushio - Fukai , 2006 ) . Consistent with this idea , we found NADPH oxidase localized in the growth cone periphery at sites where actin assembly occurs . The present study is also interesting from an evolutionary point of view . While ancestral NOX2 - , p22 phox - , p47 phox - , and p67 phox - homologs have been identified for several invertebrate species including Monosiga brevicollis , Nematostella vectensis , Strongylocentrotus purpuratus , as well as the snail Lottia gigantea , no p40 phox homolog has been identified in these species thus far , which has led to the conclusion that p40 phox may have evolved later with the chordata ( Kawahara et al . , 2007a ; Sumimoto , 2008 ) . Very recently several predicted Aplysia NADPH oxidase - like sequences have been released to the NCBI database , including NOX2 - like ( XP _ 005090645 ) , NOX5 - like XP _ 005101964 ) , DUOX1 - like ( XP _ 005108327 ) , and DUOX2 - like ( XP _ 005106629 ) . Our antibody results suggest that a NOX2 - type NADPH complex with all membrane and cytosolic subunits including the regulatory subunit p40 phox already evolved with the appearance of the molluscan clade . Other available antibodies against NOX2 - type subunits did not detect proteins with high enough specificity ( data not shown ) ; thus , because of this limitation we were unable to detect other subunits of the NOX2 - type complex in Aplysia growth cones thus far . Our quantification of H 2 O 2 - levels following PKC activation revealed that the NADPH oxidase is functionally active in growth cones . VAS2870 abolished the fast 77 PDBu - stimulated increase in H 2 O 2 - levels in the growth cone periphery within 30 sec ( Fig . 3 . 5I ) . Treatment of growth cones with VAS2870 alone for 15 min resulted only in a modest decrease of H 2 O 2 - levels ( Fig . 3 . 5H ) . These findings are in line with another study demonstrating that VAS2870 significantly blocked the increase of ROS levels in endothelial cells activated by oxidized low - density lipoprotein , but had minimal effect on the basal ROS levels without stimulation ( Stielow et al . , 2006 ) . There are several possible reasons why VAS2870 treatment alone did not lower basal H 2 O 2 - levels more significantly . First , NADPH oxidases are not the only source for superoxide / hydrogen peroxide . Second we are measuring hydrogen peroxide in this assay and not superoxide , which is the primary product of NADPH oxidase . Third , ROS are highly reactive , act locally , and are tightly regulated ; thus , it might be difficult to optically detect local changes in ROS levels induced by NADPH oxidase inhibition with sufficient temporal resolution , despite the fact that such changes can affect cellular physiology and morphology . Cytoskeletal association of regulatory NOX subunits has been previously reported for p40 phox , p47 phox , and p67 phox in non - neuronal cells . All three cytosolic subunits associate with the Triton X - 100 - insoluble cytoskeleton as well as the membrane cytoskeleton in neutrophils and endothelial cells ( Nauseef et al . , 1991 ; el Benna et al . , 1994a ; El Benna et al . , 1999 ; Li and Shah , 2002 ) . Furthermore , p40 phox and p47 phox associate with the neutrophil cytoskeleton through a PX - domain - dependent interaction with the actin - associated protein moesin ( Wientjes et al . , 2001 ; Zhan et al . , 2004 ) , while p40 phox also interacts with the actin - binding protein coronin ( Grogan et al . , 1997 ) , as well as directly with the actin cytoskeleton via its PX domain ( Shao et al . , 2010 ) . These 78 findings suggested that actin - association of cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits may have a regulatory function by keeping the complex in an inactive state until a stimulus releases the subunits from the cytoskeleton during the activation process . In agreement with this idea , COS - 7 expression experiments revealed that p40 phox is associated with actin and moesin , and that a mutated form of p40 phox shows higher actin association and inhibits NOX2 activity ( Chen et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , the actin - binding protein cortactin has been suggested to regulate NOX2 activation in lung endothelial cells trough an interaction with p47 phox ( Usatyuk et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , actin rearrangements could also deliver cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits to the plasma membrane . Does NOX2 localization show actin - dependence ? In migrating endothelial cells , NOX2 colocalizes with F - actin along the leading edge in an IQGAP1 - dependent manner , while manipulating the actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin and jasplakinolide alters NOX2 localization ( Ikeda et al . , 2005 ) . Our growth cone studies presented here also suggest a certain actin - dependence of NOX2 localization as indicated by the reduction of NOX2 following cytochalasin treatment and the co - localization of NOX2 with actin along the leading edge and in transition zone ruffle / intrapodia ( not shown ) . Thus , a fraction of NOX2 along with p40 phox appears to undergo retrograde flow together with the actin cytoskeleton . In summary , our present work in neuronal growth cones is consistent with previous findings made with leukocytes and endothelial cells indicating that the actin cytoskeleton may play a role in NADPH oxidase activation through localization of its subunits . On the other hand , NADPH oxidase - derived ROS regulate actin organization and dynamics , growth cone motility , and neurite growth ( this study ; Munnamalai and Suter , 79 2009 ) and actin organization and migration of non - neuronal cells including leukocytes , keratinocytes , endothelial , smooth muscle , and HeLa cells ( Nimnual et al . , 2003 ; Wojciak - Stothard et al . , 2005 ; Schroder et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2011a ; Kuiper et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , together with these findings , our current study suggests an interesting bi - directional relationship between NADPH oxidase and F - actin . We propose that the regulatory cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits such as p40 are associated with actin structures in unstimulated growth cones . Upon growth cone stimulation by guidance cues , cytosolic subunits p47 phox , p67 phox , p40 phox , and Rac1 translocate to the plasma membrane ( either with or without F - actin ) and activate the membrane bound subunits NOX2 / p22 phox . NADPH oxidase - produced superoxide ( or most likely hydrogen peroxide ) diffuses back into the growth cone for local regulation of the cytoskeleton and related directional growth . In agreement with this hypothesis , we found increased p40 phox / NOX2 levels and co - localization at growth cone contact sites with apCAM beads ( not shown ) and interacting growth cones , where apCAM exhibits increased density as well ( Thompson et al . , 1996 ; Suter et al . , 1998 ) . These results indicate that apCAM - clustering can trigger actin remodeling as well as NADPH oxidase activation related to neurite outgrowth . The details of the functional relationship and order of events of apCAM clustering , actin reorganization , and NADPH oxidase activation are unclear at this point . apCAM clustering could first activate NADPH oxidase followed ROS - mediated actin reorganization ; or apCAM - mediated actin remodeling could activate NOX2 by translocating cytosolic subunits close to plasma membrane . Thus , additional studies will be necessary to address the important question whether NADPH oxidase activation plays a functional role in directional axonal growth triggered by apCAM or other guidance cues 80 CHAPTER 4 . NOX EXPRESSION DYNAMICS IN ZEBRAFISH This work described in this chapter was previously published . The text presented here is adapted , with permission , from the original publication ( Weaver et al . , 2015 ) . 4 . 1 Introduction Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are a class of small molecules that can oxidize many biomolecules including proteins and lipids . Overproduction of ROS has been implicated in a number of diseases including hypertension , neurodegenerative conditions , and cancer ( Montezano and Touyz , 2014 ; Nakanishi et al . , 2014 ; Nayernia et al . , 2014 ) . However , when produced in a controlled fashion in response to a specific stimulus , ROS also act as critical signaling intermediates in a growing number of cellular signaling pathways regulating multiple biological processes including cell differentiation , migration , and death ( Finkel , 2011 ; Forman et al . , 2014 ) . Although there are several sources of ROS within the cell , one class of enzymes called nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidases ( commonly abbreviated NOX ) are especially interesting in the context of cellular signaling , because these enzymes can be activated and inactivated by a variety of mechanisms , including by cytosolic proteins and signaling molecules as 81 well as by controlling expression ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Lambeth et al . , 2007 ; Brown and Griendling , 2009 ; Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , a comprehensive knowledge of NOX soform expression could inform future studies on regulation and function of different NOX isoforms . NOX2 is the first isoform to be identified and characterized . It is expressed in phagocytes , which use NOX2 - derived ROS for bacterial killing ( Nauseef , 2004 ) . Following the initial discovery of NOX2 , several additional isoforms have been identified in multicellular organisms , including NOX1 , NOX3 , NOX4 , NOX5 , DUOX1 , and DUOX2 in humans ( Fig . 1 . 1 ) ( Kawahara et al . , 2007b ) . In the human cardiovascular system , NOX1 , NOX2 , NOX4 , and NOX5 are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells ( Jay et al . , 2008 ; Zimmerman et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2014 ) as well as in endothelial cells ( BelAiba et al . , 2007 ; Drummond and Sobey , 2014 ) . NOX activity is involved in blood pressure regulation and can lead to hypertension if out of control ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . In the reproductive systems , NOX1 and 5 have been detected in human uterine tissue ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ; Brown and Griendling , 2009 ) , while testis and ovary express NOX2 , NOX4 , and NOX5 ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ; Banfi et al . , 2004b ) . NOX isoforms are also found in several other tissues including rabbit fibroblasts ( NOX2 ) , fish keratinocytes ( DUOX ) , human kidneys ( NOX1 / 2 / 4 / 5 ) , human epithelial tissues of the colon ( NOX1 ) and lung ( DUOX ) , and in human thyroid tissue ( DUOX ) ( Pagano et al . , 1997 ; De Deken et al . , 2000 ; Harper et al . , 2006 ; Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Rokutan et al . , 2008 ; Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ; Holterman et al . , 2015 ; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) . Of particular interest to the present study is the expression of NOX in the nervous system . NOX1 , NOX2 , and NOX4 have been identified in cultured neurons derived from 82 both peripheral and central nervous system ( Hilburger et al . , 2005 ; Tejada - Simon et al . , 2005 ; Coyoy et al . , 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2009 ; Sorce and Krause , 2009 ; Choi et al . , 2012 ; Kallenborn - Gerhardt et al . , 2012 ; Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ; Wilson et al . , 2015 ) . NOX3 is expressed in inner ear neurons ( Banfi et al . , 2004a ) and has been implicated in balance based on swimming defects observed in NOX3 mutant mice ( Paffenholz et al . , 2004 ) . Not surprisingly , NOX1 and NOX2 are also expressed in microglia , the phagocyte - like cells with immune function in the central nervous system ( Wu et al . , 2006 ; Cheret et al . , 2008 ; Fischer et al . , 2012 ) . With respect to neuronal functions , NOX proteins have been implicated in neuronal stem cell maintenance in the brain ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) , cerebellar development ( Coyoy et al . , 2013 ) , neuronal differentiation ( Tsatmali et al . , 2006 ) , neuronal polarity and neurite outgrowth ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ; Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ; Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ; Wilson et al . , 2015 ) , and synaptic plasticity ( Kishida et al . , 2006 ) . As detailed above , different NOX enzymes are found in many tissue types including in the nervous system and perform critical functions in these cells . In several cases , different NOX isoforms have been identified in the same tissue or even cell types ; however , the functional relationship of the individual isoforms is often unclear . NADPH oxidase appears to have important roles in neuronal development ; however , a systematic , tissue - scale characterization of NOX isoform expression throughout development of the nervous system has not been performed so far . In part , this is due to the limited availability of antibodies against several NOX isoforms in a number of species including zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) ( Altenhofer et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the current expression data from antibodies lacks validated support from other methods such as in situ 83 hybridization ( ISH ) ( Nayernia et al . , 2014 ) . Tissue - specific NOX expression has often been reported in the form of Western blot data involving mixed cell populations . Some studies have shown cell - type specific expression of NOX in cultured cells , but these are often limited to specific isoforms ( Kishida et al . , 2006 ; Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ; Wilson et al . , 2015 ) and therefore fail to show the contributions , if any , of other NOX isoforms in the same cell type . In addition , immunolocalization studies using cell cultures often focus on a specific cell type . Thus , there are only a few studies that investigated NOX isoform expression in a broad range of tissues during development and into adulthood ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ) . Here , researchers found that NOX5 is expressed in all human fetal tissues but later becomes restricted to specific adult tissue such as uterus ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ) . In summary , a comprehensive NOX isoform expression analysis in the developing nervous system is missing . Expression data would not only confirm / identify the neuronal source of ROS for established functions but potentially unveil new functions of ROS signaling in neurons . Here , we analyzed expression of Nox isoforms during early zebrafish development . Zebrafish have been used to study several NOX functions including neutrophil migration , wound healing , and axon regeneration ( Niethammer et al . , 2009 ; Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ; Yoo et al . , 2011 ; Yan et al . , 2014 ; de Oliveira et al . , 2015 ) . Sequences for nox1 , nox2 ( also called cytochrome B - 245 or cybb ) , nox4 , nox5 , and duox genes have been identified in the zebrafish genome . nox4 , however , is not well annotated , consists of multiple transcripts , and the suggested mRNA sequence does not align well with other known nox4 gene sequences ; therefore , we decided to focus our expression analysis on the other four isoforms . Humans express two distinct isoforms of duox ( 1 / 2 ) 84 while zebrafish express only a single isoform ( Niethammer et al . , 2009 ; Rigutto et al . , 2009 ) . To expand the current knowledge of NOX function in zebrafish nervous system development and regeneration , it is critical to know the spatiotemporal expression pattern of NOX genes . We used quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) along with ISH to characterize expression of nox1 , nox2 / cybb , nox5 , and duox in the embryonic zebrafish during the first forty - eight hours after fertilization , which coincides with the development of major aspects of the zebrafish central nervous system ( Schmidt et al . , 2013 ) . We identified dynamic changes in expression levels among three of the four isoforms studied . Furthermore , we found broad expression of all NOX isoforms during early development , which becomes more enhanced in specific regions of the brain at later developmental stages . 4 . 2 Results 4 . 2 . 1 nox1 In the present study , we investigated the expression of nox1 , cybb , nox5 , and duox genes at the mRNA level during the first forty - eight hours after fertilization in developing zebrafish embryos . The molecular compositions of the respective NADPH oxidase complexes for each of these isoforms are shown in Fig . 1 . 1 . Quantitative PCR performed on mRNA extracted from whole zebrafish embryos showed that nox1 expression is the highest at 12 hpf among all four isoforms investigated ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) . After this time point , 85 Figure 4 . 1 : nox genes are expressed during early zebrafish development Relative expression levels derived via quantitative PCR from each of the 4 zebrafish NOX genes normalized to cybb at 12 hpf . cybb was chosen to normalize the data set as it was the most consistently expressed isoform . n = 6 for each data point . Error bars = SEM from all 6 data points . the nox1 expression decreases nearly ten - fold and remains consistent at this level throughout the next 36 h ( p < 0 . 0001 at 12 hpf versus 24 , 36 and 48 hpf ) . We next used ISH with single - stranded , antisense RNA probes to investigate nox1 gene expression in the nervous system of developing zebrafish embryos at 24 , 36 , and 48 hpf ( Fig . 4 . 2 ) . We did not use 12 hpf embryos for ISH because our main focus was on the nervous system and no significant nervous system development has occurred at this stage . Images of whole - mount embryos demonstrate that nox1 expression is broad in the head and anterior spinal cord ( Fig . 4 . 2A - C ) . Next , we made 10 µm - thick transverse tissue sections from in situ hybridized embryos to provide a higher spatial resolution profile of nox1 expression in the forebrain ( Fig . 4 . 2E - H ) , eye ( Fig . 4 . 2I - L ) , midbrain ( Fig . 4 . 2M - P ) , hindbrain ( Fig . 4 . 2Q - T ) , and anterior spinal cord ( Fig . 4 . 2U - X ) . At 24 and 36 hpf , nox1 expression is relatively uniform in all of these regions . By 48 hpf , nox1 expression is 86 Figure 4 . 2 : Broad nox1 expression through the first two days of development ( A - D ) Lateral views of whole - mount ISH embryos probed with antisense ( A - C ) and sense control ( D ) riboprobe against zebrafish nox1 mRNA .

In zebrafish , it is commonly referred to as cytochrome b - 245 beta polypeptide ( cybb ; GenBank ID 393386 ) . As assessed via qPCR , cybb expression levels display marked consistency during the first two days of development in comparison to the other NOX isoforms ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) . Images of whole - mount ISH embryos show broad expression of cybb throughout the head and spinal cord ( Fig . 4 . 3A - D ) . Similarly to nox1 , cybb is broadly expressed in all tissues examined during the first 36 h ( Fig . 4 . 3 E - F , I - J , M - N , Q - R , U - V ) . By 48 hpf , the region of the midbrain corresponding to the optic tectum shows a slight increase in cybb expression ( Fig . 4 . 3O ) . cybb remains broadly expressed in the forebrain , eye , hindbrain and spinal cord . 4 . 2 . 3 nox5 qPCR results indicate that nox5 has a similar expression profile as nox1 but at a significantly lower level ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) . nox5 reaches peak expression at 12 hpf , but exhibits lower expression levels by 24 hpf , which remain constant until 48 hpf ( p < 0 . 0001 at 12 hpf versus 24 , 36 and 48 hpf ) . By 36 hpf , nox5 exhibits the lowest expression levels of 88 Figure 4 . 3 : Broad nox2 / cybb expression through the first two days of development ( A - D ) Lateral views of whole - mount ISH embryos probed with antisense ( A - C ) and sense control ( D ) riboprobe against zebrafish nox2 / cybb mRNA .

Both whole - mounts and transverse tissue sections of ISH embryos demonstrate that nox5 is broadly expressed throughout the nervous system at 24 and 36 hpf similarly to nox1 and nox2 ( Fig . 4 . 4 A - B , E - F , I - J , M - N , Q - R , U - V ) . By 48 hpf , nox5 shows a small increase in expression levels dorsally along the anterior - posterior axis from the forebrain ( Fig . 4 . 4G ) to the spinal cord ( Fig . 4 . 4W ) . 4 . 2 . 4 duox At 12 hpf , total duox expression is lower than any other NOX isoform . duox remains at this low level until 36 hpf , when expression increases by more than 10 - fold ( p = 0 . 0001 at 36 hpf versus 12 and 24 hpf ) . High expression levels similarly to cybb and nox1 are maintained from 36 hpf to 48 hpf ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) . duox is the only NOX isoform to undergo such a significant increase in expression during the first 48 h of development . Similarly to the other three NOX isoforms , whole - mount ISH embryos and tissue sections through the head and spinal cord at 24 and 36 hpf demonstrated that duox expression is relatively broad ( Fig . 4 . 5 A - B , E - F , I - J , M - N , Q - R , U - V ) . By 48 hpf , duox expression domains become more unique . In the midbrain of 48 hpf fish , duox demonstrated a unique expression pattern that clearly deviates from any other NOX isoforms . duox is highly expressed in small regions surrounding the tectal ventricle , rather than broadly expressed in the dorsal region as found for nox5 ( Fig . 4 . 5O ) . Furthermore , duox expression is not increased in the tectum unlike the other three isoforms . In the spinal cord , duox is expressed throughout the neural tissue of 48 hpf fish with a slight increase on the dorsal side ( asterisk in Fig . 4 . 5W ) . In summary , similarly to 90 Figure 4 . 4 : Broad nox5 expression through the first two days of development ( A - D ) Lateral views of whole - mount ISH embryos probed with antisense ( A - C ) and sense control ( D ) riboprobe against zebrafish nox5 mRNA .

This makes NOX enzymes excellent candidates to participate in cellular signaling in response to specific upstream stimuli . Within the nervous system , NOX isoforms have been shown to function in astrocytes , microglia , and neurons ( Sorce and Krause , 2009 ; Fischer et al . , 2012 ; Nayernia et al . , 2014 ) . NOX hyperactivity plays a role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . Despite these well - publicized deleterious roles , NOX enzymes also have important functions in normal central and peripheral nervous system development and function ( Sorce and Krause , 2009 ; Nayernia et al . , 2014 ) . These include neuronal stem cell maintenance ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) , cerebellar development ( Coyoy et al . , 2013 ; Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) , neuronal differentiation ( Tsatmali et al . , 2006 ) , neuronal polarity and neurite outgrowth ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ; Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ; Wilson et al . , 2015 ) , and synaptic plasticity ( Kishida et al . , 2006 ) . However , comprehensive analyses of NOX expression in the nervous system , such as the current study , are crucial to better understand the role these enzymes plays in development , disease , and regeneration . 92 Figure 4 . 5 : duox is highly expressed around tectal ventricle at 48 hpf ( A - D ) Lateral views of whole - mount ISH embryos probed with antisense ( A - C ) and sense control ( D ) riboprobe against zebrafish duox mRNA .

Sequences for nox1 , cybb , nox5 , and duox genes have been identified in the zebrafish genome ; however , when and where individual NOX genes are expressed in fish embryos is currently unknown . We used qPCR ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) and ISH ( Figs . 2 - 5 ) to characterize the expression of nox1 , cybb , nox5 , and duox in the developing fish nervous system between 12 and 48 hpf . qPCR data shows dynamic changes in nox1 , nox5 and duox expression while cybb levels are remarkably consistent from 12 to 48 hpf . Whole - mount ISH data is overall qualitatively in agreement with the qPCR data ; however , it is important to keep in mind that ISH is not a quantitative method . Thus , proper quantification of ISH is difficult if not impossible between different time points and within tissues . All four NOX isoforms are broadly expressed in the early nervous system at 24 and 36 hpf . Whereas the broad expression continues , subtle differences in midbrain expression are visible by 48 hpf . nox1 , cybb , and nox5 show slightly elevated expression in the dorsal regions of the midbrain corresponding to the optic tectum . In contrast , duox expression was enriched in the regions adjacent to the tectal ventricle by this time . Increased labeling in dorsal and ventricle - adjacent regions was not observed in other samples using tissue of comparable thickness . Therefore we believe that the small increases in nox1 , cybb , and nox5 expression in the dorsal midbrain is real and not due to a technical artifact caused by incomplete probe penetration or probe trapping . Nonetheless , in most cases these increases are subtle and may not necessarily suggest functional significance . One might wonder why the four zebrafish NOX isoforms show a very similar expression pattern early in development . A few points should be considered here . First , 94 we have not assessed protein levels , since isoform - specific antibodies are still sparse and not well validated in the zebrafish model system . It is possible that different NOX isoforms show more distinct expression patterns at the protein level during first 2 days of zebrafish development depending on translational regulation . MicroRNAs have been shown to effect the activity of NOX4 , the constitutively active isoform of NOX ( Gordillo et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Based on this , it is plausible that other NOX isoforms could be post - transcriptionally regulated . Thus , it will be important to investigate the levels of protein expression in the developing nervous system . Second , broad NOX expression during early development is not without precedent as NOX5 expression is present in all human fetal tissues but more restricted in adult tissue ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ) . Because of broad expression of all NOX isoforms early during development , knocking out one isoform might result in functional compensation by another NOX isoform and therefore not generate strong phenotypes . This idea is supported by the fact that ROS levels in cultured cerebellar granule neurons derived from NOX2 knockout mice were not different from wild type control neurons ( Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) . In addition , there is not much information in the literature about strong nervous system phenotypes of existing NOX knockout mouse models , besides the mild impairments in hippocampus - dependent memory in NOX2 knockout mice ( Kishida et al . , 2006 ) . Lastly , it is important to keep in mind that the different NOX isoforms have unique activation mechanisms , and the resulting ROS are expected to act locally close to the source . Thus , even if multiple isoforms are expressed in the same cell type at any given time , different upstream signals could activate distinct NOX isoforms , which act in specific functions such as cell differentiation , adhesion , or migration . 95 Our current data on broad expression of NOX genes suggest that NOX activity may be a central contributor during nervous system development . We are aware that the present expression data of the main enzymatic subunit of the NOX complex is not sufficient to make any conclusions about ROS levels in different regions of the nervous system . However , we believe that the results from this study will provide important information when interpreting results of future studies addressing the function of NOX enzymes in embryonic zebrafish nervous system development and neurogenesis using pharmacological and molecular manipulations of activity and expression levels of NOX isoforms 96 CHAPTER 5 . FUNCTION OF NOX IN ZEBRAFISH RETINAL DEVELOPMENT 5 . 1 Introduction Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) readily oxidize many biomolecules , including proteins , DNA , and lipids . Like other post - translational modifications , oxidation can have a significant impact on biological functions such as cell migration ( Hung et al . , 2011 ; Yoo et al . , 2011 ; Tauzin et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , there is a need to tightly control the production of ROS in the cell . Unlike other cellular sources of ROS , some isoforms of an enzyme family called nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidases ( Nox ) produce a burst of ROS only upon activation . This makes Nox enzymes ideal candidates to be involved in ROS - mediated signaling . Nox activity has now been linked to various cellular signaling pathways involving Src tyrosine kinase , Wnt , and tumor necrosis factor alpha . Specifically , Nox - derived ROS are shown to be key signaling molecules in multiple biological processes ( Brown and Griendling , 2009 ; Yoo et al . , 2011 ; Choi et al . , 2012 ; Kajla et al . , 2012 ; Spencer et al . , 2013 ; Weaver and Taylor - Fishwick , 2013 ; Nayernia et al . , 2014 ; Tauzin et al . , 2014 ) . Nox - derived ROS have also been shown to mediate signaling in the nervous system ( Nayernia et al . , 2014 ) . Nox activity in adult mouse brains is essential for 97 neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus and long - term potentiation ( Tejada - Simon et al . , 2005 ; Kishida et al . , 2006 ) . Studies using cultured rat hippocampal neurons have shown that Nox2 is critical for the establishment of neuronal polarity ( Wilson et al . , 2015 ) . Nox2 activity also regulates neurite outgrowth and actin dynamics in cultured neurons from Aplysia californica ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ; Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , Nox inhibition causes defects in rat cerebellar development ( Coyoy et al . , 2013 ) and reduced neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons ( Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) . Furthermore , neural stem cells retain a high level of ROS that is critical for their self - renewal , and ROS production in these cells has been linked to Nox2 ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ; Le Belle et al . , 2011 ; Ren et al . , 2015 ) . Taken collectively , these studies show that Nox - derived ROS are critical components of normal signaling in the nervous system . However , the detailed functions of Nox during normal nervous system development in vivo are not well understood . The goal of the present study was to determine the role of Nox in the development of axonal tracts in the nervous system . We used zebrafish embryos as a model system since they are a well - validated model of vertebrate neurodevelopment and compatible with in vivo imaging , immunolabeling , and molecular genetics . Gene sequences for five nox isoforms have been identified in the zebrafish genome ( nox1 , nox2 also called cybb in zebrafish , nox4 , nox5 , and duox ) . Since the nox4 gene is not well annotated in zebrafish , it was excluded from the current study . A series of studies showed that Nox - derived ROS mediate leukocyte and macrophage recruitment and promote wound healing in zebrafish ( Yoo et al . , 2011 ; Yoo et al . , 2012 ; Tauzin et al . , 2014 ) . With respect to the nervous system , one study found that DUOX is important for peripheral axon 98 regeneration ( Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ) . We have recently shown that zebrafish express nox1 , cybb , nox5 and duox broadly throughout the central nervous system during early development ( Weaver et al . , 2015 ) . However , whether or not specific Nox isoforms play a functional role in zebrafish neurodevelopment remains unclear . Here , we report that Nox2 is critical for the development of retinotectal connections . We show that transient pharmacological Nox inhibition during early development leads to an expansion of the ganglion cell layer ( GCL ) , thinning of the optic nerve ( ON ) , and decreased innervation of the optic tectum ( OT ) . To determine which Nox isoforms are involved in retinal development , we generated isoform - specific nox mutant fish using CRISPR / Cas9 . We found that homozygous nox2 / cybb mutations caused an expansion of the GCL and mistargeted retinal axons in the OT . Taken together , these results demonstrate a novel role for nox2 / cybb in the developing zebrafish visual system . 5 . 2 Results 5 . 2 . 1 Nox inhibition leads to defects in retinal development In order to study the role of Nox function in nervous system development , we applied a pan - Nox inhibitor , celastrol ( Jaquet et al . , 2011 ) , to zebrafish embryos and screened for neuroanatomical defects . This compound was chosen because it shows no antioxidant effects common in other Nox inhibitors like apocynin ( Heumuller et al . , 2008 ) . We observed defects specifically in the formation of the ganglion cell layer ( GCL ) 99 and the optic nerve ( ON ) when celastrol was applied between 32 and 36 hpf ( Figure 5 . 1 ) as well as the formation of anterior forebrain commissures when the inhibitor was applied between 20 and 24 hpf ( data not shown ) . Since the zebrafish visual system is well characterized anatomically , functionally , and developmentally , we chose to focus this study on the development of the retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs ) and ON . In zebrafish , the retina begins to differentiate at 28 hours post - fertilization ( hpf ) . At this time , RGCs differentiate in the GCL medial to the lens of the eye ( Hu and Easter , 1999 ) . At a point in the middle of the eye called the optic disk , axons throughout the GCL fasciculate into a single bundle called the ON . The left and right ONs then grow toward the midline of the embryo where they cross at a point called the optic chiasm at ~ 36 hpf ( Burrill and Easter , 1995 ; Stenkamp , 2015 ) . From the chiasm , ON axons grow dorso - caudally toward a midbrain region called the optic tectum ( OT ) where they form synapses with tectal neurons by 48 hpf ( Kita et al . , 2015 ) . To assess the effects of Nox inhibition on retinal and ON development , celastrol was applied at 2 . 5 µM during the period of ON fasciculation and growth toward the chiasm ( 32 – 36 hpf ) . The inhibitor was then washed out and the embryos were allowed to develop until ON axons reached the OT ( 48 hpf ) . Embryos were then fixed and immunostained with zn - 8 , an antibody that labels the GCL and ON ( Avanesov and Malicki , 2010 ) . We observed an expansion of the zn - 8 - positive GCL and a thinning of the ON in celastrol - treated fish embryos ( Figure 5 . 1A , B ) . We quantified GCL width and ON thickness as measures of retinal development ( Figure 5 . 1D , E ) . Differences in GCL width were found to be statistically significant ( F ( 2 , 35 ) = 66 . 6 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Control GCLs had an average width of 100 ± 10 . 6 µm ( mean ± SD , Figure 5 . 1A , D ) . Inhibitor - 100 Figure 5 . 1 : Nox inhibition causes defects in retinal development and tectal innervation ( A - C ) Retinal micrographs of 48 hpf embryos labeled with the RGC marker zn - 8 following a 4 hour treatment with 0 . 1 % DMSO ( A ) or 2 . 5 µM celastrol ( B – C ) .

Previous studies have shown that Nox loss - of - function can be rescued via the addition of hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) ( Le Belle et al . , 2011 ; Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ) . Therefore , we optimized a rescue approach using several concentrations of H2O2 applied continuously throughout the first 48 hpf ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . We found that 2 mM H2O2 did not have any impact on embryonic survival or any visible effect on visual system development ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . Therefore , we applied 2 mM H 2 O 2 immediately following celastrol treatment ; however , this did not affect the width of the GCL compared to celastrol only - treated embryos ( 127 ± 3 . 6 µm , p = 0 . 7886 , Figure 5 . 1C , D ) . Differences among mean ON thickness were also found to be significant ( ( F2 , 35 ) = 133 . 5 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Control embryos treated with 0 . 01 % DMSO displayed a mean ON thickness of 25 ± 3 . 4 µm ( Figures 1A , E ) . ONs of celastrol - treated embryos were significantly thinner ( 9 ± 2 . 2 µm , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 1B , E ) . Here , H 2 O 2 application caused a marked recovery of ON thinning ( 17 . 9 ± 1 . 5 µm , p < 0 . 0001 compared to celastrol alone , Figure 5 . 1C , E ) . We then used the Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) transgenic line to label RGCs and the ON in live embryos . Using this strategy , we were able to image retinal development and OT innervation at different time points in the same embryo . In response to the Nox inhibitor treatment , the GCL again appeared wider ( Figure 5 . 1G ) . To determine if this wider GCL represented an expansion of RGCs within the retina , we calculated the ratio of the GFP - positive area divided by the total area of the retina , and found significant differences 102 Figure 5 . 2 : Optimization of H 2 O 2 rescue ( A ) Percent survival versus hydrogen peroxide concentration measure at 24 and 48HPF .

The GCL in inhibitor - treated embryos occupied a greater proportion of the retina versus controls ( Figure 5 . 1L ; 0 . 45 ± 0 . 05 , 0 . 24 ± 0 . 03 , respectively , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Similarly to our findings with zn - 8 labeling ( Figure 5 . 1D ) , treatment with H 2 O 2 did not significantly diminish the ratio of the retina occupied by GFP - positive RGCs versus celastrol treatment ( 0 . 47 ± 0 . 04 , p = 0 . 43 ) . We again found a significant difference among mean ON thickness the three treatment groups ( F ( 2 , 47 ) = 85 . 6 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Control embryos had ONs with a mean thickness of 25 . 5 ± 3 . 4 µm ( Figure 5 . 1F , M ) whereas ONs of inhibitor - treated embryos were significantly thinner compared to controls ( 9 . 9 ± 2 . 0 µm , p < 0 . 0001 , Figures 1G , M ) . The addition of H 2 O 2 103 partially rescued ON thickness compared to celastrol treatment ( 22 . 0 ± 4 . 6 µm , p < 0 . 0001 , Figures 1H , M ) . We next investigated the innervation of the OT in response to Nox inhibition . No differences in axon targeting were observed as all GFP signals localized to the presumptive OT as determined by visual comparison to control embryos . However , we measured the area of the OT innervated by GFP - positive axons and found significant differences among groups ( F ( 2 , 53 ) = 105 . 3 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Controls displayed a mean area of 7998 ± 1154 µm 2 at 72 hpf ( Figure 5 . 1I , N ) . Celastrol - treated embryos showed a significant decrease in OT innervation ( 3164 ± 721 µm 2 , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figures 1J , N ) . Like ON thickness , OT innervation was partially rescued by the 2 mM H 2 O 2 applied immediately following inhibitor treatment ( 6538 ± 1384 µm 2 , p < 0 . 0001 versus celastrol , Figures 1K – N ) . Collectively , these results demonstrate that pharmacological Nox inhibition results in GCL expansion , ON thinning , and reduced OT innervation , indicating a role for Nox in normal retinal development . 5 . 2 . 2 nox2 / cybb chimeric mutants display retinal defects To determine the specific Nox isoform involved , we used the clustered regularly - interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) / Cas9 genome editing technique to generate isoform - specific mutations in zebrafish embryos . We designed two guide RNAs ( gRNAs ) per Nox isoform , and injected these gRNAs into 1 - cell stage embryos to generate site - specific mutations in the nox genes . The locations of the gRNA target sites with respect to full - length Nox proteins are shown in Figure 5 . 3A . We first calculated the 104 efficiency of the gRNAs by quantifying the percentage of mutant embryos generated by each gRNA ( Table 4 ) . All of the gRNAs produced mutations in at least 65 percent of the injected embryos . Some ( e . g . nox1 gRNAI and nox5 gRNAII ) generated mutations in greater than 90 percent of the injected embryos . We also genotyped the predicted off - target sites , shown in Table 2 , for each gRNA and found no mutations at these locations in the genome ( data not shown ) . Table 5 . 1 . gRNA efficiency Embryos were genotyped as described in Methods . Total refers to the total number of embryos that were injected and genotyped . Mutant refers to the number of embryos found to carry mutations . Using this validated set of Nox isoform - specific gRNAs , we investigated which Nox isoforms contribute to retinal development . Therefore , we co - injected both gRNAs against a given nox gene into Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) embryos which generated a set of novel mutations in each embryo . Due to the random incorporation of insertions and deletions in the early cells , these embryos are chimeric . Therefore , these chimeric embryos retain an unknown percentage of wild - type nox genes in certain tissues . The implications of this will be addressed in the Discussion . The injected embryos were genotyped at both gRNA loci , and resulting phenotypes were assessed only in individuals carrying mutations at both gRNA sites . Restricting the analysis to double - site mutants maximizes the probability of producing a loss - of - function mutation .

Injected embryos that did not carry mutations at either gRNA site served as wild - type controls for 106 these experiments ( Figure 5 . 3B , G ) . None of the nox chimeric mutants showed expansion of the GCL as in the case of inhibitor - treated embryos ( Figure 5 . 3B - F ) or significant mistargeting of GFP - positive axons within the midbrain ( Figure 5 . 3G – K ) . Importantly , ON thickness and OT innervation in controls were similar to what was found previously in DMSO - treated embryos ( 26 . 8 ± 5 . 0 µm and 7998 ± 1154 µm 2 , respectively , Figure 5 . 3B , G , L , M ) . ONs of nox1 mutants are not significantly different from wild - type controls ( 28 . 7 ± 5 . 2 µm , p = 0 . 24 , Figure 5 . 3C , L ) . OT innervation was similarly unaffected in these mutants ( 8063 ± 1946 µm , p = 1 . 00 , Figure 5 . 3H , M ) . Similar to what was observed in response to pharmacological Nox inhibition , nox2 / cybb mutants displayed thin ONs ( 17 . 4± 5 . 1 µm , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 3D , L ) . The OT of nox2 / cybb mutant larvae showed sparse GFP signals indicating a reduced number of ON axons innervating the tissue ( 4840 ± 1835 µm 2 , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 3I , M ) . nox5 mutants also displayed ON thinning ( 18 . 2 ± 5 . 5 µm , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 3E , L ) and decreased tectal innervation ( 4995 ± 2243 µm 2 , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 3J , M ) . However , nox5 mutants have severe general morphological defects early in development that might interfere with the formation of the brain and retina ( data not shown ) . Since nox2 / cybb mutants better phenocopied our inhibitor - treated embryos , we chose to focus on nox2 / cybb in subsequent experiments . Finally , duox mutants displayed insignificant ON thinning ( 25 . 3± 5 . 5 µm , p = 0 . 44 versus control , Figure 5 . 3F , L ) and decreased tectal innervation ( 7556 ± 1417 µm 2 , p = 0 . 74 versus control , Figure 5 . 3K , M ) . In summary , these results showed that among the different nox isoforms , nox2 / cybb plays a critical the development of the zebrafish visual system . 107 5 . 2 . 3 Optic nerve projection is delayed in nox2 / cybb mutants The effect of nox2 / cybb mutation is a thin , underdeveloped ON at 48 hpf , whose axons fail to properly innervate the OT by 72 hpf ( Figure 5 . 3D , I ) . To address whether these defects in retinotectal connectivity persist at later time points , we leveraged the live - imaging capability of the Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) line to capture ON and OT images from nox2 / cybb chimeric embryos at multiple time points . We also included a set of nox2 / cybb chimeric mutants that were incubated with 2 mM H 2 O 2 as a rescue control condition . As shown in Figure 5 . 4B and C , we observed characteristic ON thinning in nox2 / cybb mutants at 48 hpf ( 14 . 7 ± 3 . 7 µm , p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 4I ) . ONs from nox2 / cybb mutants incubated with H 2 O 2 were significantly thicker than untreated mutants ( 19 . 8 ± 3 . 4 µm , p = 0 . 0035 versus mutant , Figure 5 . 4D , I ) , indicating that the phenotype observed in nox2 / cybb mutants is likely due to reduced H 2 O 2 levels . We then imaged the same embryos at 72 hpf to assess the persistence of ON thinning . By this time point , nox2 / cybb mutants recovered ( 35 . 7 ± 7 . 8 µm , Figure 5 . 3B’ - C’ ) such that they were nearly identical to controls ( 39 . 9 ± 6 . 9 µm , Figure 5 . 4A’ ) . H 2 O 2 - treated larvae were similar to controls with a thickness of 37 . 3 ± 5 . 2 µm ( Figure 5 . 4D’ ) . No significant differences were detected among groups suggesting that the ON phenotypes observed in response to nox2 / cybb mutation could be transient , and likely due to developmental delays ( F ( 2 , 57 ) = 2 . 086 , p = 0 . 7842 ) . We then turned our attention to the effects of nox2 / cybb mutations on OT innervation . Imaging the same samples over three days , we saw a progressive increase in 108 .

Significant differences among groups were identified at both time points ( F ( 2 , 48 ) = 38 . 37 , p < 0 . 0001 for 72 hpf ; F ( 2 , 48 ) = 9 . 106 , p = 0 . 0004 for 96 hpf ) . Innervated areas in the OT from nox2 / cybb mutants were significantly smaller than control ( p < 0 . 0001 ) and H 2 O 2 rescue condition ( p < 0 . 0001 ) at 72 hpf ( Figure 5 . 4E - H , J ) . By 96 hpf , innervated tectal areas of mutants and H 2 O 2 - treated mutants were still smaller than controls ( p = 0 . 0006 and 0 . 005 , respectively ) , but were not different from one another ( p = 0 . 72 , Figure 5 . 4E’ - H’ , J ) . A more severe loss of OT innervation was detected in nox2 / cybb mutants by 120 hpf ( F ( 2 , 48 ) = 291 . 9 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . OT innervation in mutants drops to 3590 ± 1357 µm 2 ( p < 0 . 0001 versus control , Figure 5 . 4F” , G” , J ) compared to wild - type controls ( 13 , 505 ± 844 µm 2 , Figure 5 . 4E” , J ) , and is significantly different from H 2 O 2 treated mutants ( 11 , 462 ± 1444 µm 2 , p < 0 . 0001 , Figure 5 . 4H” & J ) . These results suggest that OT innervation is initially delayed in nox2 / cybb chimeras , whereas more severe defects arise later . 5 . 2 . 4 nox2 / cybb - / - embryos show expansion of the GCL To minimize the potential phenotypic variability of nox2 / cybb mutant chimeras , we generated stable fish lines harboring homozygous nox2 / cybb mutations at either site targeted by the nox2 / cybb gRNAs ( referred to as nox2 / cybb - / - ) . Two lines carrying mutations at different loci within the nox2 / cybb gene were generated to confirm the convergence of phenotypes and ensure the specificity of mutagenesis . The mutant line generated from gRNA I had a 5 base - pair deletion while the line from gRNA II carried a 110 23 base - pair deletion ( Figure 5 . 5A ) . Each line carries a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence for nox2 / cybb , which results in a significant truncation of the Nox2 / Cybb protein ( Figure 5 . 5B ) . Both Nox2 / Cybb mutant enzyme types have lost the C - terminal substrate binding domain . Four histidine residues within alpha helices III and V are essential for electron shuttling to the O 2 acceptor , and at least one of these critical histidines are missing in both mutant types ( Kawahara and Lambeth , 2007 ; Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . Without these critical functional domains , the mutant Nox2 / Cybb proteins are likely not functional . Since nox2 / cybb - / - mutant lines do not carry the Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) transgene , we used zn - 8 antibodies to visualize axons . Samples were also counterstained with the nuclear label DAPI to assess overall retinal development and lamination . In these experiments , wt clutch mates served as controls . In contrast to chimeras , nox2 / cybb - / - embryos exhibited significant expansion of the zn - 8 - positive GCL at 48 hpf ( F ( 2 , 41 ) = 63 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The GCL in gRNAI ( 0 . 49 ± 0 . 06 , Figure 5 . 5D – D” , I ) and gRNAII mutants ( 0 . 48 ± 0 . 04 , Figure 5 . 5E – E” , I ) occupies a greater proportion of the retina compared to controls ( 0 . 34 ± 0 . 03 , Figure 5 . 5C – C” , I , p < 0 . 0001 versus mutants ) . Unlike the ON phenotypes observed in chimeric mutants , GCL expansion did not recover by 72 hpf in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants , and many cells were pyknotic at this later stage ( Figure 5 . 5G’ – H’ ) . In controls , the wt GCL occupied a similar percentage of the retina at 72 hpf compared to that at 48 hpf ( 0 . 31 ± 0 . 02 , Figure 5 . 5F – F” , I ) Mutant GCLs represented a significantly higher proportion of the retina compared with wild type controls ( gRNA I 0 . 48 ± 0 . 05 , gRNA II 0 . 45 ± 0 . 06 , p < 0 . 0001 , Figure 5 . 5G – H” , I ) . These results further confirm a role for Nox2 / Cybb in GCL development . Interestingly , the ON was not significantly thinner in 111 the homozygous mutants compared to wt controls ( data not shown ) . The phenotypic differences observed among inhibitor - treated , chimeric , and homozygous mutant embryos will be addressed in the discussion .

The area of the midbrain occupied by innervating ON axons in wt embryos is largely devoid of DAPI - positive cell bodies ( Figure 5 . 6A – A” ) . This represents a prototypical morphology of the zebrafish OT ( Kita et al . , 2015 ) . In nox2 / cybb - / - mutants , zn - 8 - positive axons are mistargeted to adjacent midbrain regions outside of the presumptive OT ( Figure 5 . 6B – C ) . Additionally , there is no area devoid of DAPI - positive cell bodies in the presumptive location of the OT suggesting the absence of a single nerve bundle entering the midbrain ( Figure 5 . 6B’ – C’ ) . To better evaluate the changes in tectal innervation , we used line scans visualizing the changes in labeling intensity across the tectum . In wt embryos at 72 hpf , fluorescent intensity is highest in the area corresponding to the OT , and falls precipitously in adjacent regions ( Figure 5 . 6B – C” ) . In contrast , line scans through tectal areas of nox2 / cybb - / - mutants reveal lower signals in presumptive tectal areas , whereas zn - 8 - positive axons can be found in extra - tectal areas ( Figure 5 . 6B , C , G ) . By 120 hpf , a significant number of zn - 8 positive axons in the midbrain of nox2 / cybb - / - mutants were not targeted uniformly to the presumptive OT ( Figure 5 . 6E , F ) . Again , DAPI staining in mutant embryos failed to show an area free of cell bodies indicative of an axon tract ( Figure 5 . 6 E’ , F’ ) . Line scans continued to show a reduced and more diffuse zn - 8 signals in tecta of mutants when compared with wild type embryos ( Figure 5 . 6H ) . Collectively , these results show that nox2 / cybb - / - embryos exhibit defective ON development that results in improper axonal targeting within the OT . 113 Figure 5 . 6 : Axons are mistargeted in the OT of homozygous nox2 / cybb mutants ( A – C” ) Micrographs of 72 hpf nox2 / cybb - / - midbrains labeled with zn - 8 ( A – C ) , and DAPI ( A’ – C’ ) .

We have previously shown in cultured Aplysia californica neurons that cell autonomous Nox activity is critical for proper actin organization , actin retrograde flow , and neurite 114 outgrowth ( Munnamalai and Suter , 2009 ; Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) . The latter study , showed that Nox2 regulatory subunits co - localize at adhesion sites suggesting that Nox2 may be involved in adhesion - mediated axonal growth . A separate study identified Nox as a critical regulator of neuronal polarity and axonal growth of rat hippocampal neurons and mouse cerebellar granule neurons ( Coyoy et al . , 2013 ; Wilson et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we investigated the role of Nox in zebrafish retinal development . We found that Nox inhibitors caused an expansion of the GCL , thinning of the ON , decreased OT innervation and mistargeting of axons within the OT . To investigate the role of specific Nox isoforms in this process , we used CRISPR / Cas9 mutagenesis to create chimeric mutants targeted to each of four zebrafish nox isoforms . Among all four nox isoform mutants , we observed that nox2 / cybb chimeric mutant fish displayed a phenotype that was most similar to the one caused by pharmacological Nox inhibition . nox2 / cybb chimeric mutants exhibited ON thinning and decreased tectal innervation caused by developmental delays , which were rescued by treatment with H 2 O 2 . In contrast to fish embryos treated with Nox inhibitor , the GCLs in these nox2 / cybb chimeric mutants were not expanded when compared with wt embryos . To better characterize the impact of nox2 / cybb mutation , we then bred chimeric mutants into stable lines carrying a truncated version of Nox2 / Cybb for each of the two nox2 / cybb - specific gRNAs ( nox2 / cybb - / - ) . Homozygous mutants displayed GCL expansion , alterations in retinal morphology and mistargeting of axons in the OT . None of these phenotypes improve at later stages suggesting that they are not the result of developmental delays . We can divide the phenotypes observed in this study into two broad classes . First , we found developmental delays that recovered at later developmental stages and could be 115 rescued by H 2 O 2 . These included ON thinning and a decrease in the area of OT innervation . Since both of these phenotypes respond to H 2 O 2 , it seems that they are generally sensitive to ROS and not absolutely dependent on Nox2 / Cybb . Phenotypes of the second class did not improve with time or respond to the addition of H 2 O 2 . These include GCL expansion and the mistargeting of axons in the OT . This OT phenotype is distinct from the decrease in OT innervation described above . Here , axons reach the midbrain without delay , but extend outside of the presumptive OT . The absence of H 2 O 2 - mediated rescue for this second class of phenotypes suggests that they specifically require Nox2 / Cybb , and alternative sources of ROS will not suffice . The presence or absence of some of these phenotypes with the different experimental approaches can be explained by inherit differences among the experimental techniques as further explained below . Whereas the individual phenotypes ( GCL expansion , ON formation , area of OT innervation and targeting of axon in the OT ) are likely functionally linked to one another , the current strategy of global Nox inhibition and knockout approach does not allow us to conclude that the observed effects are solely due to Nox2 / Cybb activity in RGCs . Nonetheless , our current study clearly demonstrates a functional role for Nox2 / Cybb in zebrafish retinal development and outgrowth of RGC axons towards the OT . Embryos injected with CRISPR / Cas9 components display chimerism . This is due to the time required for CRISPR / Cas9 complex formation after injection . During this time , cells of the embryo continue to divide , leading to the generation of unique mutations in each cell . This results in chimeric animals carrying multiple mutations along with wild - type alleles . Since the type of mutation generated at the target site is variable , it is impossible to determine the net result on protein function . This means that chimeras 116 typically have less severe phenotypes , owing to the presence of an unknown percentage of functional enzyme . nox2 / cybb chimeric mutants express both functional and non - functional Nox2 / Cybb , leading to a global decrease in Nox2 / Cybb activity . This decrease would be expected to diminish , but not completely inhibit propagation of Nox2 / Cybb - mediated signals . This means that Nox2 / Cybb - dependent events such as GCL development and targeting of axons in the OT still occur , but may happen more slowly . This explains the presence of developmental delays in chimeras characterized by ON thinning and decreased OT innervation that recover at later time points . nox2 / cybb - / - embryos on the other hand are not expected to express any functional protein , and thus , experience a strong , persistent loss of Nox2 / Cybb activity . Given that Nox isoforms are known to compensate for one another , it is reasonable to speculate that nox2 / cybb - / - mutants might activate compensatory mechanisms to survive . These mechanisms may include increased expression of other Nox isoforms , a decrease in cellular antioxidants or activated regulatory subunits binding to a different Nox isoform ( Yang et al . , 2001 ; Banfi et al . , 2003 ; Frantz et al . , 2006 ; Pendyala and Natarajan , 2010 ) . Any of these alternative sources of ROS would be expected to mask developmental delays in much the same way that H 2 O 2 can rescue these phenotypes . This fits our observations since nox2 / cybb - / - mutants do not exhibit delays characterized by ON thinning or a decrease in OT innervation . However , compensatory sources of ROS might not be able to rescue phenotypes specifically requiring Nox2 / Cybb , just as H 2 O 2 cannot rescue these phenotypes . Again , this fits with our observation of GCL expansion and mistargeting of axons in the OT in nox2 / cybb - / - samples . Compensation to mask 117 developmental delays is not expected in chimeras since functional Nox2 / Cybb is still present in these embryos . Differences in the timing and extent of interfering with Nox activity among the approaches used in our study might also explain the observed response to pharmacological Nox inhibition . Celastrol treatment is expected to completely inhibit all Nox isoforms temporally restricted to a few hours during ON development . These embryos display phenotypes of both classes such as GCL expansion , ON thinning and a decrease in the area of OT innervation likely stemming from the temporary but complete loss of Nox activity . We would predict that nox2 / cybb - / - mutants have localized decreases in ROS that impact signaling . ROS biosensors such as HyPer3 ( Bilan et al . , 2013 ) and ro - GFP ( Meyer and Dick , 2010 ) allow in vivo , ratiometric imaging of ROS . However , it is unlikely that macro - scale changes in ROS production might be observed due to possible compensation by non - mutant Nox isoforms and mitochondria that contribute to global redox homeostasis . Our current approach of CRISPR / Cas9 mutagenesis does not allow for spatial or temporal control . However , newly developed techniques allow for restricted expression of Cas9 using cell - type specific ( Ablain et al . , 2015 ) or heat - shock promoters ( Yin et al . , 2015 ) . Cell - type specific mutagenesis will provide insight into cell - autonomous functions of Nox , whereas temporally controlled mutagenesis will reveal the role of Nox at specific developmental stages . Additionally , these new technologies will allow for the dissection of molecular signaling pathways in specific cell types that underlie the phenotypes we report here . 118 In conclusion , we report that Nox2 / Cybb is involved in the development and differentiation of RGCs in the zebrafish retina , the timing of ON outgrowth and the targeting of RGC axons within the OT . This finding advances the role of Nox - mediated signaling to include neurodevelopmental events in the retina . Lastly , we believe that the nox2 / cybb - / - fish line generated in the present study will be a valuable resource for future investigations of Nox2 / Cybb function not only in the nervous system , but also in other organ systems and cell types . . 119 CHAPTER 6 . CONCLUSIONS FROM NEURONAL CULTURE STUDIES 6 . 1 NOX2 and p40 phox in Aplysia neurons In Chapter 3 , I presented a series of experiments demonstrating the presence and function of a NOX2 - like protein in Aplysia neuronal growth cones . I demonstrated that NOX activity is necessary for neurite extension , actomyosin - driven retrograde flow and actin organization . Treatment with NOX inhibitors , VAS2870 or celastrol , decreased retrograde flow rates and stalled neurite outgrowth ( Figures 3 . 1 & 3 . 2 ) . The effect was reversed when inhibitors were washed out after 20 minutes , but the effects of overnight application were irreversible . In cell bodies , NOX2 and p40phox were rarely colocalized . NOX2 localized to the plasma membrane , and p40 phox displayed a cytosolic , punctuate distribution ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . . Some puncta were stained positive for NOX2 , p40 phox and actin ( Figure 3 . 4F’ ) . VAS2870 caused a subtle decrease in ROS levels under basal growth conditions , but was able to block spikes in ROS production caused by the NOX activator phorbol 12 , 13 - dibutyrate ( PDBu , Figure 3 . 5 ) . In growth cones , antibody labeling for NOX2 and p40 phox revealed a punctuate distribution for both proteins ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . I then showed that NOX2 and p40 phox puncta colocalize with f - actin in the growth cone periphery ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . Additional experiments included in the published version of this work showed the dependence of peripheral NOX2 and p40 phox localization on actin and 120 the enrichment of NOX2 / p40 phox colocalization at artificially - induced adhesion sites ( Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) . Collectively , this work identified NOX2 and p40 phox in Aplysia , and showed a direct interaction between the NOX subunits and actin . These results showed that NOX activity is necessary for proper actin dynamics and neurite outgrowth . It is still unclear how exactly NOX - derived ROS are involved in growth cone signaling . In this chapter , I will introduce additional evidence from our lab suggesting that NOX may be involved in cell adhesions in neuronal growth cones and in zebrafish RGC neurite outgrowth . Additionally , I will briefly review upstream signals and downstream effectors that have been associated with NOX and are relevant to growth cone guidance . Finally , I will propose approaches to extend our current work addressing the function of NOX in axonal growth and guidance . 6 . 2 Evidence for NOX in neuronal cell adhesions Compared to other species , neurites from Aplysia bag cell neurons grow slowly . The large size of the growth cone , which is excellent for imaging , makes turning assays difficult . Therefore , it is challenging to observe guidance in these cells . However , we can induce artificial adhesion sites that mimic turning responses by applying 5µm beads coated with a cell adhesion molecule ( apCAM ) directly to P domain of the growth cone ( Suter et al . , 1998 ; Suter and Forscher , 2001 ; Suter , 2011 ) . The beads are carried retrogradely via actomyosin - driven flow . If the bead is restrained with a microneedle , the growth cone will respond by extending the microtubule - rich central domain and apply 121 additional force to pull the bead ( Suter et al . , 1998 ) . This process is largely analogous to the turning and steering responses in smaller growth cones that direct axon growth and guidance Additional work from our lab showed that NOX2 / p40 phox colocalization is enriched at sites of bead interactions ( Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) . Whether NOX is activated in response to apCAM binding is still unknown , however the assembly of subunits would suggest this is the case . Future experiments will determine whether NOX activity is necessary for apCAM - meditated responses , but the finding of NOX2 / p40 phox colocalization suggests that NOX2 may be activated by apCAM binding , and may play a role in downstream signaling that leads to growth cone turning . 6 . 3 Nox function in zebrafish retinal neurons Cultured neurons with smaller , faster growing neurites would allow us to perform growth cone turning assays that are not possible with Aplysia neurons . Since my in vivo studies focus on retinal nerves from zebrafish , I decided to culture these cells for in vitro assays . I performed preliminary experiments on neurons derived from 36 hpf zebrafish retinas ( AB strain ) on coverslips coated with 20µg / mL laminin . Retinal neurons exhibited processes extending > 50µm after 12 hours in culture growing at 10 ± 1 . 3µm / hr ( Figure 6 . 1A - E ) . This growth rate is similar to what has been observed for retinal neurons in vitro ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) and in vivo ( Kita et al . , 2015 ) . I then tested the response of retinal neurons to the application of growth factors and cues including nerve growth factor ( NGF , 20ng / mL ) , netrin - 1 ( Netrin , 250ng / mL ) and semaphorin 3E ( Sema3E , 5µg / mL , 122 Figure 6 . 1E ) . Neurite growth rates were no different in response to NGF , but netrin - 1 caused a slight , but not statistically significant decrease in growth rate ( Figure 6 . 1E ) . This could be due to the relatively low number of cells analyzed ( n = 12 ) in this preliminary study . The response to sema3E was a robust retraction of neurites . This pilot study showed that we could culture zebrafish retinal neurons in our lab and that neurite growth rates respond to growth factors and guidance cues . Figure 6 . 1 : Cultured zebrafish retinal neurons respond to soluble cues ( A - D ) Time - lapse image series showing neurite outgrowth from a retinal neuron harvested from a wild type zebrafish at 36 hpf . Cells were cultured on laminin for 12 hours prior to imaging . Images were captured at 20 minute intervals for 1 hour . ( E ) Graph showing mean neurite growth rates ± SEM under control conditions ( serum - free media ) and in response to global application of the indicated guidance cue . Numbers in parenthesis represent the numbers of cells analyzed . Significant differences were identified with one - way ANOVA ( F ( 3 , 60 ) = 13 . 72 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . p - values for Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests versus controls are shown above comparison bars . p < 0 . 05 was considered significant . Since my preliminary trials , use of the zebrafish neuronal culture system has been extended by others in the lab . We now culture neurons derived from the Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) transgenic line to restrict our analysis to RGCs . We have also moved from global application of growth factors and guidance cues to directional applications that allow for quantification of neurite turning in addition to measurements of growth rate . 123 We also turned to the in vitro culture system to test the effect of Nox inhibitors on RGC neurite outgrowth . The in vivo studies described in Chapter 5 present a complex set of phenotypes that likely stem from the global manipulations of Nox activity with inhibitor applications and CRISPR mutants . To focus specifically on Nox in RGCs , we applied the inhibitors VAS2870 or celastrol to retinal neurons in culture . We saw a dose - dependent reduction in RGC neurite outgrowth following a 15 minute pre - incubation with the inhibitors . The sensitivity of these cells to the drugs suggests that RGCs express one or more NOX isoforms , and that Nox activity is necessary for neurite outgrowth . Additional experiments are needed to uncover the isoforms expressed and the mechanistic details of Nox - mediated signaling in RGCs . The experiments proposed in section 6 . 6 may be performed using Aplysia bag cell neurons or zebrafish RGCs . 6 . 4 Upstream activators of NOX From our studies , NOX appears to be important for neurite outgrowth in multiple species . Additionally , preliminary work suggests that NOX may be activated at adhesion sites in Aplysia neurons . If NOX is to act as a signal in axon growth and guidance , it is practical to consider what upstream signals might be using NOX - derived ROS as an intermediate . At present , there is little evidence for the involvement of NOX in traditional guidance cue signaling pathways like semaphorins , netrins , and slits . However , the finding that Mical - derived ROS is necessary for semaphorin - mediated axon guidance in Drosophila ( see Chapter 1 ) leaves open the possibility that NOX may be involved in some of these pathways as well . Axons are also guided by morphogens , mitogens , 124 extracellular matrix proteins , proteoglycans and cell adhesion molecules ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ; Stenkamp , 2015 ) . While the involvement of NOX in these cellular signals has not been well studied in neurons , there is overwhelming evidence that NOX mediates these signals in other cell types . To provide a basis for further experiments , the following sections introduce NOX - mediated signaling pathways that are known to induce cell motility . Additional NOX and ROS - related cellular signals involved specifically in the development of the optic nerve are presented in Chapter 7 6 . 4 . 1 Platelet - derived growth factor Shortly after their discovery , NOX enzymes were found in the cells of the vasculature , and much of what is known about NOX - mediated cell signaling comes from this field ( Drummond and Sobey , 2014 ) . The cells lining the walls of the vasculature control blood circulation and blood pressure . In particular , the misregulation of two cell types , vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) and endothelial cells , contribute to the onset and progression of atherosclerosis and hypertension ( Hadrava et al . , 1991 ; Castellon and Bogdanova , 2016 ) . Both cell types respond to platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) . VSMCs treated with PDGF become proliferative and motile , and it is well - established that PDGF stimulation of VSMCs is accompanied by H 2 O 2 production ( Sundaresan et al . , 1995 ) . In the same study , authors found that application of ROS scavengers blocks PDGF - stimulated kinase activity and chemotaxis , demonstrating that ROS production was necessary for signal propagation . Subsequent studies found that the NOX inhibitor VAS2870 also blocked PDGF - induced ROS production and VSMC 125 migration ( ten Freyhaus et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , the authors found that VAS2870 did not affect PDGF - stimulated DNA synthesis or cell cycle progression , suggesting that these processes are not dependent on NOX . Finally , NOX1 was identified as the source of ROS downstream of PDGF in VSMCs ( Maheswaranathan et al . , 2011 ) . Aortic smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs ) also produce ROS and become proliferative in response to PDGF . Unlike VSMCs , ROS produced by human ASMCs in response to PDGF is dependent on NOX5 ( Jay et al . , 2008 ) . It is unclear exactly how PDGF signaling pathways are divergent in VSMCs versus ASMCs in other aspects , but these studies reveal that the source of ROS varies with cell type . Since NOX1 and NOX5 are activated by very different types of upstream signals , these results suggest that PDGF signals are propagated very differently in these two cell types Endothelial cells also become proliferative in response to PDGF , and this is dependent on the production of ROS via NOX . PDGF - induced cell migration in endothelial cells is specifically dependent on NOX1 ( Garrido - Urbani et al . , 2011 ) . Authors found that endothelial cells express NOX1 , 2 and 4 , but PDGF signal propagation is dependent on NOX1 . This is one example of a cell type coexpressing multiple NOX isoforms but maintaining functional specificity for each . This is relevant to the results I presented in Chapter 4 of overlapping expression domains for multiple nox genes in the zebrafish central nervous system . 126 6 . 4 . 2 Additional NOX - mediated growth factors Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is a potent mitogen that promotes angiogenesis . VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells causes proliferation and migration . Like PDGF , VEGF stimulation is accompanied by an increase in ROS . Preincubation with NOX inhibitors blocks the VEGF - mediated spike in ROS along with cell migration and proliferation demonstrating that all of these responses are NOX dependent ( Abid et al . , 2000 ) . A subsequent study showed that VEGF stimulation induced that translocation of p47 phox to sites of membrane ruffling ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) . Translocation was accompanied by p47 phox phosphorylation , Rac1 activity and ROS production , and this suggests that NOX2 is responsible for VEGF - induced ROS production . Angiotensin II ( AngII ) is a growth promoting mitogen for smooth muscle cells ( Fyhrquist et al . , 1995 ) . One study identified expression of NOX1 , 2 and 4 in VSMCs , but found that NOX1 specifically contributed to AngII signaling and proliferative responses ( Lassegue et al . , 2001 ) . A separate study found that NOX4 was responsible for basal ROS production in rat ASMCs , but NOX1 was specifically activated in response to AngII ( Dikalov et al . , 2008 ) . Authors of a different study found NOX1 and NOX4 activity downstream from insulin - like growth factor 1 in VSMCs ( Meng et al . , 2008 ) . However , the primary isoform responsible for ROS production in this pathway is still unknown . NGF - mediated signaling has also been linked to NOX . Treatment of PC12 cells with NGF causes neurite extension that is accompanied by a rise in ROS levels . NGF exposure leads to an increase in nox1 and decrease in nox2 mRNA transcripts . 127 Accordingly , NOX inhibitors and nox1 - targeted ribosymes block NGF - induced ROS production ( Ibi et al . , 2006 ) . However , the researchers found that blocking ROS enhanced NGF - induced neurite outgrowth . They went on to speculate that NOX1 may prevent excessive growth of neurites when cells are exposed to NGF . Collectively , these results show that several growth factors induce the production of ROS via NOX and rely on ROS - mediated signal transduction for some functions . It should be noted that VSMCs , ASMC and endothelial cells all express multiple NOX isoforms . However , specific isoforms seem to be involved in the transduction of signals . Upstream signals are even able to differentiate between the NOX1 and NOX2 , which are regulated in very similar ways . How growth factor signaling cascades target individual NOX isoforms is an open question that deserves further study . 6 . 4 . 3 Cell adhesions Focal adhesions ( FAs ) are multi - protein complexes linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix . Formation and turnover of FAs is critical for cell motility , and has been implicated in cellular behaviors ranging from cancer metastasis to axon guidance ( Wozniak et al . , 2004 ; Myers et al . , 2011 ) . Treatment of endothelial cells with H 2 O 2 causes the formation of stress fibers and phosphorylation of the FA - associated proteins focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and paxillin ( Vepa et al . , 1999 ) . Subsequent studies showed a direct interaction between the NOX2 subunit p47 phox and another FA protein , TRAF4 ( Wu et al . , 2005 ) . TRAF4 binding helped localize p47 phox to the FA site . In this case , ROS generated at FAs oxidized a protein tyrosine phosphatase , PTP - PEST , and likely 128 inhibited function . This is similar to what was discussed in Chapter 1 wherein oxidation inhibits the function of PTP - 1B ( Salmeen et al . , 2003 ) . A separate study suggested the involvement of NOX4 in FAs due to the colocalization of NOX4 with vinculin , an FA complex protein ( Hilenski et al . , 2004 ) . While this work was solely based on immunolabeling , additional evidence has shown that NOX4 mediates FA turnover and migration in VSMCs ( Datla et al . , 2014 ) . More recent studies continue to support for the role of NOX - derived ROS in establishment and turnover of FAs during cell migration ( Basuroy et al . , 2010 ; Abdelsaid and El - Remessy , 2012 ) . However , much of the current work is focused on NOX1 / 4 in spite early reports showing NOX2 in FA complexes . Vascular CAM ( VCAM ) regulates the maintenance of stem cell populations in the subventricular zone of adult mice . VCAM signaling is accompanied by ROS production via NOX2 ( Kokovay et al . , 2012 ) . The results of this study are particularly relevant to my work since they demonstrate a role for NOX2 - mediated CAM signaling in the central nervous system . NOX is known to mediate growth factor signals , focal adhesions dynamics and CAM - based adhesions ( summarized in Table 6 . 1 ) . The role of these signals in axon guidance is well established , and NOX enzymes are known to be expressed in neurons . Further , our work demonstrates the importance of NOX activity to neurite outgrowth . Therefore , it is reasonable to hypothesize that NOX - derived ROS may be involved in axon growth and guidance downstream of one or more of these signals . I propose experiments designed to test this hypothesis and extend our current results in section 6 . 6 . 129 Table 6 . 1 : Growth factors and adhesion molecules involving NOX 6 . 5 Downstream targets of NOX - derived reactive oxygen Axon and neurite outgrowth is driven by cytoskeletal dynamics . In Chapter 1 , I introduced what is known about redox regulation of actin and microtubules . It is tempting to speculate that NOX - derived ROS in Aplysia growth cones and zebrafish acts directly on the cytoskeleton to effect dynamics , organization and neurite outgrowth . However , there are several other redox - sensitive effectors that are involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell motility . Many of these have been previously studied in our lab , and thus , are even more relevant to consider for future experiments . 6 . 5 . 1 Src Src is a non - receptor tyrosine kinase activated downstream of growth factors , adhesion molecules and other cellular signals . Src signaling is commonly implicated in cancer and has also been shown to be involved in growth cone guidance ( Suter and Forscher , 2001 ; Suter et al . , 2004 ; Buday and Downward , 2007 ; He et al . , 2015 ) . Our lab Protein Function ( s ) Section Source of ROS PDGF 6 . 4 . 1 NOX1 / 5 VEGF NOX2 AngII NOX1 NGF NOX1 TRAF4 NOX2 Vinculin NOX4 Integrin NOX2 / 4 VCAM NOX2 6 . 4 . 2 focal adhesions : migration 6 . 4 . 3 growth factor : proliferation , chemotaxis 130 has previously shown that Src activation promotes lamellipodial protrusion and filopodial stability in Aplysia growth cones ( He et al . , 2015 ) . With regard to NOX , early studies showed that p47 phox was a Src substrate , making Src an upstream activator of NOX2 in VSMCs ( Touyz et al . , 2003 ) . However , subsequent studies showed that Src is activated by H 2 O 2 oxidation via the formation of a C - terminal disulfide bond ( Giannoni et al . , 2005 ; Mills et al . , 2007 ; Basuroy et al . , 2010 ) . Eventually , it was discovered that Src and NOX1 form a positive feedback loop in response to inflammatory cytokines in beta cells ( Weaver et al . , 2012 ; Weaver and Taylor - Fishwick , 2013 ) . Like developing axons , neutrophils and leukocytes are highly motile . These cells infiltrate wound margins to facilitate healing . In zebrafish , H 2 O 2 is produced at wound margins by DUOX , and this ROS acts as a signal to recruit leukocytes to the damage tissue ( Niethammer et al . , 2009 ) . A zebrafish Src family kinase member , Lyn , was found to be responsible for redox sensitivity in neutrophils . Oxidation of cysteine 466 mediates Lyn activation and neutrophil migration into the ROS gradient ( Yoo et al . , 2011 ) . This work was extended to show that NOX - derived ROS and Src are necessary for tail regeneration and , surprisingly , the reduction of post - injury inflammation ( Yoo et al . , 2012 ; Tauzin et al . , 2014 ) . Our lab has significant experience studying Src in Aplysia growth cones . Therefore , we are uniquely equipped to investigate a possible NOX / Src signaling axis in this model system . 131 6 . 5 . 2 Cortactin Cortactin is an f - actin binding protein and a Src substrate ( Decourt et al . , 2009 ; He et al . , 2015 ) . Our lab has also found that cortactin is involved in lamellipodial and filopodial dynamics in Aplysia growth cones ( He et al . , 2015 ) . It has been shown that H 2 O 2 treatment of endothelial cells caused an increase in Src - dependent cortactin phosphorylation ( Li et al . , 2000 ) . This is expected since Src activity is increased in response to ROS application . However , later studies revealed that p47 phox is localized to f - actin filaments , and this interaction is mediated by direct interaction with cortactin ( Touyz et al . , 2005 ) . p47 phox has also been linked to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics via cortactin ( Patel et al . , 2013 ) . However , this study posited a NOX - independent function for p47 phox so the exact connection between cortactin and NOX - derived ROS remains unclear . 6 . 5 . 3 Slingshot / cofilin Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin is an actin filament severing protein that regulates actin dynamics . ADF / cofilin activity is involved in several axon guidance pathways including netrins , ephrins and slits ( Marsick et al . , 2010 ; Marsick et al . , 2012 ) . ADF / cofilin binds and severs existing f - actin filaments . This causes f - actin to depolymerize and creates new actin nucleators to facilitate polymerization ( Bamburg and Bernstein , 2010 ) . The phosphorylated form of ADF / cofilin is inactive , therefore activation is mediated by a phosphatase called Slingshot ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ; Kaji et al . , 132 2003 ) . Slingshot is regulated by binding to a 14 - 3 - 3 protein , which maintains Slingshot in the inactive state . NOX - derived ROS oxidize the 14 - 3 - 3 protein inducing the release of Slingshot and subsequent activation of cofilin ( Kim et al . , 2009 ) . Redox regulation of Slingshot / 14 - 3 - 3 binding has been observed in VSMCs ( Lee et al . , 2009 ; Maheswaranathan et al . , 2011 ) and keratinocytes ( Kim et al . , 2011b ) . The study in keratinocytes found NOX - mediated Slingshot regulation in response to neuregulin , a growth factor known to be involved in neurodevelopment . 6 . 5 . 4 WAVE and moesin The WASP - family verprolin homologous protein - 1 ( WAVE1 ) is an actin binding protein involved in the regulation of actin lamellipodial networks via the nucleator Arp2 / 3 ( Pollitt and Insall , 2009 ) . In response to VEGF , WAVE1 is localized to membrane ruffles and mediates actin reorganization . One study found that WAVE1 directly interacts with p47 phox , and this interaction is necessary for cytoskeletal modification ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) . Early but promising research implicates another actin binding protein , moesin , in NOX - mediated signaling . Moesin is one of a family of proteins shown to link f - actin to the plasma membrane ( Tsukita and Yonemura , 1997 ) . Cell - free studies have shown that moesin binds to the PX domain of both p47 phox and p40 phox ( Wientjes et al . , 2001 ) . There is no functional data to link moesin to NOX activity , but it is noteworthy given that other actin binding proteins , like cortactin and WAVE , have been found to be regulated by NOX - derived ROS . 133 6 . 6 Future directions for the growth cone project The studies discussed in sections 6 . 4 and 6 . 5 show that NOX is involved in growth factor and adhesion - based signaling , and downstream signals in these pathways are redox sensitive . While the bulk of this evidence is derived from non - neuronal cells , the basic mechanisms of signal propagation and regulation of dynamics may translate to many motile cells . My work , discussed in Chapters 3 , shows the requirement for NOX activity in Aplysia bag cell neurons , and the preliminary studies in section 6 . 3 extend this into cultured zebrafish RGCs . In addition , we have evidence that suggests NOX2 may be active at adhesion sites in Aplysia growth cones ( Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) . Moving forward , I propose to investigate the specific function of NOX - derived ROS during axon growth and guidance . I would then screen for soluble guidance cues and substrate molecules that modulate the production of ROS in the neuronal growth cone . Next , I would dissect the molecular signaling pathways downstream of the cues that lead to NOX activation . Finally , I would investigate the direct effectors of NOX - derived ROS that contribute to growth cone turning . An essential part of all of these studies would be to monitor cellular ROS levels in real time . In the past , we have used cell - permeable dyes like 2’ , 7’ - dichlorofluorescin ( DCF ) and Peroxyfluor - 6 ( PF6 ) to monitor ROS levels ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ) . These dyes require the addition of a volume indicator dye , and are subject to ROS - mediated autofluorescence . Therefore , they are not optimal for long - term , dynamic ROS imaging of single cells . Better suited for these experiments are the latest generation ROS biosensors : roGFP2 - Orp1 and HyPer3 ( Meyer and Dick , 2010 ; Bilan et al . , 2013 ) . 134 Table 6 . 2 : Downstream effectors targeted by NOX - derived reactive oxygen ‘ROS’ refers to redox sensitive targets where no source has been identified . ‘NOX’ indicates that no specific isoform has been identified . roGFP2 - Orp1 relies on the peroxidase activity of yeast Orp1 to oxidize the redox sensitive roGFP2 ( Gutscher et al . , 2009 ) . The H 2 O 2 - specific HyPer3 is based on a circularly permutated yellow fluorescent protein inserted into the regulatory domain of a naturally occurring , redox sensitive protein called OxyR ( Bilan et al . , 2013 ) . Both probes provide a quantitative method of detecting ROS in live cells , and are preferable to cell - permeable dyes . One potential drawback is the pH sensitivity of HyPer , but this is not a concern for roGFP ( Roma et al . , 2012 ) . However , newly developed pH biosensors like pHusion make it possible to measure pH changes and control for their effects on HyPer3 signals ( Gjetting et al . , 2012 ) . 6 . 6 . 1 Correlating reactive oxygen with neurite outgrowth Having shown that NOX inhibitors decrease basal ROS levels and cause neurites to stall , it is now imperative to correlate ROS production and neurite outgrowth . We have HyPer3 and roGFP2 - Orp1 in our lab , and I propose using both biosensors , independently , to quantify changes in growth cone ROS during neurite outgrowth . In the past , we have Protein Function ( s ) Section Source of ROS Actin cytoskeletal remodeling 1 . 2 . 1 Unknown Src NOX1 / 3 Lyn NOX Cortactin actin adaptor protein 6 . 5 . 2 NOX2 Slingshot 6 . 5 . 3 NOX2 WAVE NOX2 Moesin actin - membrane anchor NOX2 tyrosine kinase regulation of actin dynamics 6 . 5 . 1 6 . 5 . 4 135 used dye - based measurements to correlate ROS levels with neurite growth rates . In these experiments , we measured ROS at the end of 12 or 24 hours and compared this to overall outgrowth . The major drawback of this approach is that ROS is a very short - lived signal , and a single measurement is unlikely to correlate with long - term outgrowth . Instead , I would predict that transient spikes and troughs in ROS production would precede changes in growth rate . To capture these effects , we can use time - lapse imaging of Aplysia or zebrafish neurons expressing ROS biosensors to determine whether or not ROS levels correlate with or even predict changes in growth rate . A newly developed set of cell - permeable actin and microtubules probes based on silicon rhodamine dyes allow live - imaging of the cytoskeleton . Called SiR - actin and SiR - tubulin , these probes use far - red fluorescent wavelengths that would be compatible with either roGFP2 or HyPer3 ( Lukinavicius et al . , 2014 ) . We have used these probes to label NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts for a separate project ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . Both SiR - actin and SiR - tubulin provide stable , uniform signals in live cells , but additional validation experiments are necessary to confirm the extent of labeling . However , preliminary results are promising given that the tubulin probe even appears to label the primary cilia ( Figure 6 . 1B ) . Combining the cytoskeletal probes with ROS biosensors we could simultaneously measure ROS levels , cytoskeletal restructuring and neurite outgrowth . To directly determine the impact of changing ROS levels on neurite outgrowth , we can manipulate ROS concentrations by adding H 2 O 2 or ROS scavengers to the media . More specifically , we can determine the role of NOX by treating cells with specific NOX inhibitors ( VAS2870 , celastrol or apocynin ) or activators ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate or phorbol 12 13 - dibutyrate ) . With the ROS biosensors , we can directly 136 investigate the spatiotemporal relationships between intracellular ROS , cytoskeletal organization and neurite outgrowth . Figure 6 . 2 : SiR - actin and SiR - tubulin label cytoskeletal structures in fibroblasts NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with 100nM probes in normal media overnight . A primary cilia - like structure is visible with SiR - tubulin ( arrowhead ) . Scale bar = 10µm . We could then investigate the ability of asymmetric gradients of ROS across the growth cone to generate turning responses . Directional application of exogenous H 2 O 2 , ROS scavengers , NOX activators or inhibitors would be expected to generate gradients of ROS across the growth cone . We can verify this using the ROS biosensors . Simultaneously , we can quantify changes in the cytoskeleton , growth cone morphology and neurite outgrowth in response to the ROS gradients . This would be the first demonstration of ROS levels predicting growth cone steering . Combined with quantitative measurements of intracellular ROS and cytoskeletal dynamics , this type of experiment would provide excellent evidence for the importance of NOX - mediated redox signaling in axon guidance . 137 6 . 6 . 2 Identification of upstream guidance cues The experiments proposed above focus on the direct effect of ROS , but do not provide any physiological relevance . Even if NOX - mediated ROS can be shown to alter neurite outgrowth and guidance in vitro that it does not prove their function in vivo . If redox signaling plays a role in axon patterning , ROS production must be controlled by an upstream guidance cue . Earlier in this chapter , I detailed what is known regarding NOX - mediated growth factor and adhesion signaling . Given this , I predict that some growth factors , guidance cues or substrate proteins will modulate NOX activity in growth cones . Applied asymmetrically , cues should induce a gradient of ROS that can be measured with the ROS biosensors . Cues can be presented to the cell in various ways . The protein coated , 5µm silica beads , discussed earlier , work well in Aplysia . Traditional pipet assays or the development of patterned substrates would be more suitable for zebrafish neurons . Initial experiments would be aimed at identifying cues that asymmetrically alter intracellular ROS concentrations . This would be accomplished by combining directional application of cues with ROS biosensor imaging . Once a suitable set of cues is identified , necessity of ROS generation in cue - mediated turning can be tested by applying low concentrations of ROS scavengers to block spikes in ROS . Further , the involvement of NOX can be verified using the small - molecule inhibitors and activators presented in earlier sections . For example , if cue - mediated turning requires the production of NOX - derived ROS , pretreatment with a low concentration of scavenger or NOX inhibitor should block turning responses . The relationship between ROS generation and growth cone turning may be complex , and the response may vary among cues . Combining ROS 138 measurements , cytoskeletal imaging and neurite guidance in response to specific cues would provide physiologically relevant evidence for the necessity of NOX - derived ROS in axon guidance . 6 . 6 . 3 Characterization of downstream targets A more difficult problem is identifying downstream targets of NOX - derived ROS . The simplest possible situation would be if NOX - derived ROS acted directly on the cytoskeleton , likely actin , to mediate changes in stability and dynamics . However , given the number of redox sensitive targets involved in growth cone steering , discussed in section 6 . 5 , it is unlikely that actin is the only effector of ROS . Time - lapse imaging with SiR - actin and ROS biosensors would provide adequate temporal resolution to make this determination . Direct effects of ROS on the cytoskeleton would happen rapidly while effects controlled by intermediate signals would take longer to propagate . Careful dissection of the timecourse of cytoskeletal rearrangements in response to ROS - generating cues would delineate direct versus indirect effects , and inform subsequent studies . The next step would be to directly assess protein oxidation in response to cues . There is a comprehensive review of methods to detect all forms of oxidation , and I will not discuss them extensively here ( Shacter , 2000 ) . Instead , I will briefly mention methods that would be most relevant to NOX - mediated protein oxidation in growth cones . S - glutathionylation , cysteine / methionine oxidation and disulfide crosslinking are the most common protein modifications caused by H 2 O 2 , the primary signal produced by NOX 139 ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . These can be detected by high performance liquid chromatography , SDS - PAGE and mass spectroscopy ( Shacter , 2000 ; Verrastro et al . , 2015 ) . However , this is not a straightforward procedure since cultured neurons are typically plated at low densities and are non - proliferative . This makes it challenging to obtain enough protein for analysis . Alternative methods such as harvesting from cue - treated explant cultures would provide higher amounts of protein , but reduce the cell type specificity since non - neuronal cells may be included . This compromise may be necessary , however , to perform direct analysis of protein oxidation . Another strategy would be to look for proteins that are activated in response to ROS . Biosensors for Src and FAK , both known to be redox sensitive , are available ( Gulyani et al . , 2011 ; Seong et al . , 2011 ) , and our lab has done significant work with a novel Src biosensor in Aplysia . Using these tools , we could look for changes in activation of either protein in response to ROS - generating cues . More importantly , we could dissect the time course of activation to determine if either protein is the direct effector of NOX - derived ROS . Unfortunately , the Src / FAK and ROS biosensors have similar excitation and emission spectra , and are therefore not compatible . However , we can establish a time course of ROS production and Src / FAK activation in separate experiments In some of the studies listed in the previous sections , authors developed oxidation - insensitive mutants such as SrcC245A and SrcC487A ( Giannoni et al . , 2009 ) . We could develop redox - insensitive mutants for targets we suspect are oxidized in response to cues , and the mass spectroscopy experiments described above would identity putative oxidation sites in the target proteins . Done correctly , this approach would produce effectors that cannot be oxidized , but otherwise maintain their normal function . 140 Cells expressing these redox - insensitive mutants would not be expected to exhibit turning in response to cues that require oxidative signaling . Using the described combination of approaches we can extend the current work to directly identify cues that use NOX - derived ROS as intermediate signals and characterize the spatiotemporal parameters of ROS generation . We can measure the time course of cytoskeletal rearrangements , growth cone turning and neurite outgrowth in response to cue - induced ROS production . We can also specify the downstream effectors of ROS that lead to growth cone turning and drive neurite outgrowth . Collectively , the proposed experiments would allow us to characterize an entire ROS - mediated signaling pathway in neurons induced by specific cues . 141 CHAPTER 7 . CONCLUSIONS FROM ZEBRAFISH STUDIES 7 . 1 Summary of current work on zebrafish neurodevelopment In Chapter 5 , I described a series of experiments designed to investigate the functions of NOX enzymes in zebrafish neurodevelopment . I began applying NOX inhibitors to developing embryos . From these early screens , I identified defects in the optic nerve and anterior forebrain commissures ( Figure 5 . 1 & 7 . 1 ) . I chose to focus subsequent studies on the optic nerve because of the potential functional implications of this system . Treatment with the NOX inhibitor celastrol caused an expansion of the glial cell layer ( GCL ) , thinning of the optic nerve ( ON ) and a decrease in ON axons reaching their targets in the optic tectum ( OT , Figure 5 . 1 ) . ON thickness and OT innervation was rescued by the addition of 2mM H 2 O 2 , but GCL expansion was not ( Figure 5 . 1 ) Generation of chimeric , isoform - specific nox mutants showed that mutations of nox2 / cybb resulted in ON thinning and a decrease in OT innervation comparable to inhibitor treatments ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . No GCL expansion was observed in chimeric nox2 / cybb mutants ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . Time - lapse imaging of nox2 / cybb chimeras revealed that ON thinning was transient and recovered by 72 hours post - fertilization ( hpf , Figure 5 . 3 ) . Similarly , the area of OT innervation increased between 72 and 96 hpf in nox2 / cybb chimeras ( Figure 5 . 3 ) indicating that both phenotypes were the result of developmental 142 delays . In addition , both phenotypes were partially rescued by the addition of 2mM H 2 O 2 . Surprisingly , homozygous nox2 / cybb mutants ( nox2 / cybb - / - ) did not show significant ON thinning like nox2 / cybb chimeras . Instead , these homozygous mutants displayed GCL expansion ( Figure 5 . 4 ) and defects in axon targeting within the OT ( Figure 5 . 5 ) . In addition , nox2 / cybb - / - embryos had defective retinal lamination visualized with DAPI nuclear staining . None of the observed phenotypes improved at later stages . Figure 7 . 1 : Forebrain development in zebrafish treated with a Nox inhibitor ( A - B ) Dorsal views of a 24 hpf embryo immunolabeled with an anti - acetylated tubulin antibody . Embryos were treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO ( A ) or 2µM VAS2870 ( B ) from 18 - 22 hpf to coincide with forebrain commissure development . The anterior commissure is indicated with a white arrow in A . Commissures of inhibitor - treated embryos fail to close at the midline . In all cases , ON thinning and decreased OT innervation recovered at subsequent developmental stages and was rescued by H 2 O 2 . Therefore , both of these phenotypes can be regarded as symptoms of developmental delays . Further , that they can be rescued by global application of exogenous ROS may indicate that they are generally mediated by ROS , and do not specifically require NOX2 / CYBB . That is to say that NOX2 / CYBB may normally produce the ROS that signals in these pathways , but it can be substituted for with other sources of ROS . In contrast , GCL expansion and axon targeting in the OT 143 do not recover at later stages , and in the case of inhibitor treatments GCL expansion cannot be rescued by H 2 O 2 . This may indicate that these phenotypes are mediated specifically by NOX2 / CYBB , and cannot be substituted for other sources of ROS . Chimeras may not be expected to show GCL expansion or mistargeted OT axons because they carry some percentage of functional NOX2 / CYBB . Therefore , NOX2 / CYBB - mediated signaling would still occur , but may take more time due to the partial loss of protein function in chimeras . This simultaneously explains the presence of developmental delays and lack of permanent phenotypes . Conversely , nox2 / cybb - / - embryos that have a complete loss of NOX2 / CYBB may be forced to upregulate compensatory mechanisms in order to survive . Compensation among NOX enzymes has been evidenced in several studies ( Yang et al . , 2001 ; Banfi et al . , 2003 ; Frantz et al . , 2006 ; Pendyala and Natarajan , 2010 ) , and this is not surprising given the similarities among isoforms . Upregulation of other NOX isoforms may not even be necessary . Recall that many cells in the central nervous system express multiple isoforms . Some of the studies cited above have shown that activated NOX2 regulatory subunits can bind and activate NOX1 ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Bedard et al . , 2007 ; Sorce and Krause , 2009 ) . Therefore the mere presence of other NOX isoforms in the cell could be enough to mediate compensation . Phenotypes caused by a general decrease in ROS , like developmental delays rescued by H 2 O 2 , would be masked by compensation in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants . However , persistent phenotypes stemming specifically from the loss of NOX2 / CYBB , which are not recued by H 2 O 2 , would persist even with compensation . This explains why nox2 / cybb - / - mutants do not show developmental delays , but do have GCL expansion and defects on axon targeting in the OT . 144 Inhibitor treatments are a special case that induces both transient and permanent effects . Developmental delays are explained by the potent inhibition of all NOX isoforms over short time . Compensation could not have masked this because 1 ) all isoforms were inhibited and 2 ) the time was too short to upregulated alternative compensation . GCL expansion is likely due to the timing of application which coincided with RGC differentiation . Delayed application of the drugs would likely leave the GCL unaffected , but may cause defects in axon targeting in the OT . The effects of NOX2 / CYBB mutation extend beyond the eye . I also reported microphthalmia , pericardial edema and ventral body curling in both chimeric and homozygous NOX2 / CYBB mutants . This suggests that NOX2 / CYBB is involved generally in development , and implies that future work should be directed at discerning the role of NOX2 / CYBB in specific cell and tissue types . These phenotypes may contribute to the defects in OT innervation observed at 120 hpf . By this stage , the worsening morphological defects may impact the health of the larva . Given observations of GCL expansion , mistargeting of axons in the OT , and developmental delays , I predict that NOX2 / CYBB has a specific role in retinal and / or ON development . This is supported by the work described below in section 6 . 3 which shows that cultured zebrafish RGCs are sensitive to NOX inhibitors . To design future experiments , it is important to identify signaling pathways involved in retinal and ON development that may be redox sensitive . Therefore , in this chapter I will provide a brief overview of eye and retinal development and highlight particular signals that have been shown to involve redox signaling . I will also point out developmental events that may explain the phenotypes observed in my experiments . In the final section of this chapter , I 145 will suggest future directions for the zebrafish work with an aim to the delineate tissue - and stage - specific functions of NOX isoforms . 7 . 2 Summary of eye and optic nerve development NOX2 / CYBB mutants display defects in the eye including GCL expansion and a lack of retinal lamination . Additionally , axons are mistargeted to the OT in mutant larva . Given this , it is reasonable to consider which developmental events that underlie these processes might involve NOX - mediated signaling . To this end , the subsections below describe the induction and development of the early eye , the specification of RGCs and the mechanisms of RGC axon guidance at several stages . Comprehensive reviews of these topics have previously been published ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ; Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ; Stenkamp , 2015 ) , and it is not pertinent to repeat all of those details here . Instead , I will provide a general description of development and focus specifically on events and signaling pathways that might involve NOX . 7 . 2 . 1 Early eye development In vertebrates , the eye field is specified from the early neuroepithelium by expression of a suite of homoeodomain - containing transcription factors including pax6 , rx , s ix3 , s ix6 , lhx2 and otx2 ( Nornes et al . , 1998 ; Loosli et al . , 1999 ; Stenkamp , 2015 ; Samuel et al . , 2016 ) . Expression of these factors is restricted laterally by the presence of 146 sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) at the midline ( Macdonald et al . , 1995 ; Masai et al . , 2000 ) . The cells expressing these transcription factors evaginate from the neuroepithelium into presumptive eye masses . In zebrafish , the centers of these eye masses invaginate at ~ 20 hpf to form bilateral optic cups , double - layers of neuroepithelium ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ) . The distal layer is highly proliferative and produces all of the cells of the neural retina while the proximal layer differentiates into the retinal pigment epithelium ( Stenkamp , 2015 ) . One redox - sensitive target involved in eye specification could be pax6 . pax6 is a transcription factor involved in eye field specification that is highly conserved among vertebrates ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ) . Misregulation of pax6 leads to the formation of ectopic eyes in both zebrafish and Drosophila ( Nornes et al . , 1998 ) . Two separate studies have shown that the DNA binding affinity of a related protein , Pax8 , is dependent on the redox state of the protein ( Kambe et al . , 1996 ; Codutti et al . , 2008 ) . The latter study showed that the redox sensitive cysteine residues of Pax8 were conserved among several Pax family members . The authors went on to suggest that redox regulation could be conserved feature of all Pax family members ( Codutti et al . , 2008 ) making Pax6 a potential target for ROS - mediated signaling during eye development . 7 . 2 . 2 Ganglion cell fate determination Following the formation of the optic cup , retinal progenitors begin to divide and terminally differentiate into RGCs . In all vertebrates , RGC differentiation occurs as a wave that passes through the early retina ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ) . The shape and 147 starting point of this wave varies among species , but in zebrafish the wave begins ventrally and extends nasally , dorsally and temporally until completed ( Stenkamp , 2015 ) . Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) secreted from the optic stalk , a layer of neuroepithelium connecting the eye to the forebrain , initiates RGC specification ( Martinez - Morales et al . , 2005 ) . atoh7 , also called ath5 , a basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor is well - established as an early RGC - specifying gene ( Kay et al . , 2001 ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) . Expression of atoh7 determines RGC cell fate and leads to the expression of additional RGC - specific genes including isl1 and brn3b ( Prasov and Glaser , 2012 ; Pacal and Bremner , 2014 ) . The spatiotemporal characteristics of the RGC differentiation wave are coordinated by several signaling pathways including Shh , Wnt , retinoic acid and Notch / Delta ( Bernardos et al . , 2005 ; Masai et al . , 2005 ; Meyers et al . , 2012 ; Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ; Imai et al . , 2014 ) . Differentiated RGCs also secrete cell - autonomous signals to promote their survival . These include a neural epidermal growth factor - like protein and VEGF ( Hashimoto et al . , 2006 ; Nakamoto et al . , 2014 ) . Several factors involved in RGC specification are potentially redox sensitive . The expansion of the GCL observed in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants suggests misregulation of fate specification , so this is a particularly promising area for future studies . I detailed several examples of growth factor signaling that are mediated specifically by NOX in Chapter 6 . It is no surprise that FGF signaling , responsible for the initiation of RGC specification , is also dependent on ROS production in other cell types . Treatment of smooth muscle cells with FGF induces migration , and this is dependent on NOX1 - derived ROS ( Schroder et al . , 2007 ) The authors went on to shown that NOX1 - mediated signaling was dependent on JNK oxidation . 148 VEGF , the cell - autonomous survival signal for newly differentiated RGCs , has also been shown to be NOX - dependent in other cell types . One study found that NOX2 activity was necessary for cell survival and proliferation in response to VEGF in leukemic cells ( Maraldi et al . , 2010 ) . Another showed that FAK upregulation and cell migration in response to VEGF was mediated by oxidative inactivation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase ( Abdelsaid and El - Remessy , 2012 ) . Notch / Delta signaling is also involved in the control of RGC fate determination . While not linked to NOX , studies have shown that Notch signaling in neuronal precursors is dependent on the activity of peroxyredoxin 4 ( Prdx4 ) ( Yan et al . , 2015 ) . Disruption of Prdx4 , resulting in a lack of downstream protein oxidation , causes premature differentiation of neurons and a depletion of progenitors . It is known that neuronal precursors require elevated ROS levels to maintain potency . Depleting ROS in these cells causes premature differentiation ( Le Belle et al . , 2011 ) . A second study has shown that disrupting Notch / Delta signaling during zebrafish retinal development leads to a phenotype similar to what was observed in the nox2 / cybb - / - mutants ( Bernardos et al . , 2005 ) . The morphology of the eye , disruption of retinal lamination and pattern of GCL expansion are strikingly similar between embryos with Notch / Delta impairment and Nox2 / Cybb mutants . Therefore , it is reasonable to hypothesize a connection between Nox2 / Cybb - derived ROS and Notch / Delta signaling in zebrafish retinal development . This potential connection between ROS and Notch / Delta signaling is particularly important given the results presented in Chapter 5 . Nox2 / Cybb loss - of - function lead to disruption of inner retinal development that included an expansion of the GCL 149 A final candidate for NOX - mediated signaling is Wnt which is involved in the spatiotemporal control of the RGC differentiation wave . In developing vasculature , the propagation of Wnt5a signals have been show to rely on redox signaling ( Murdoch et al . , 2014 ) . Additional studies revealed that redox controls the activation of canonical Wnt signaling during endodermal fate specification ( Sandieson et al . , 2014 ) , and that Wnt signals in mouse colon epithelial cells and human colon cancers depend on NOX1 . These reports show that Wnt is well - established as a redox controlled pathway . Therefore , it is possible that disruptions of Wnt signaling are responsible for some of the phenotypes observed in NOX2 / CYBB mutants . 7 . 2 . 3 Early retinal axon guidance RGCs undergo a terminal differentiation in the apical retina , adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium . These non - polar cells then extend a process to the basal retina , and the nucleus migrates along this process until it reaches its terminal position at the vitreal surface ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ) . As the nucleus nears this final position , the trailing , apical process is retracted and the axon begins to emerge . Apical retraction is mediated by a coordination of slit and N - cadherin signaling ( Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ) . Axon emergence is dependent on Rac1 ( Ruchhoeft et al . , 1999 ) , and early polarized axon growth is guided by cadherins ( Riehl et al . , 1996 ) , integrins ( Lilienbaum et al . , 1995 ) and a peripheral gradient of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPGs ) ( Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ) . The expansion of the GCL observed in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants could also be due to 150 disruptions in RGC migration or early axonogeneis . Therefore , it is important to discuss potential nodes for redox signaling during these events . In Chapter 1 , I introduced Rac1 as a critical component of NOX1 , 2 and 3 enzyme complexes ( Brown and Griendling , 2009 ) . That initial RGC axon emergence is dependent on cytoskeletal rearrangements involving Rac1 , makes this event a prime candidate for NOX - mediated signaling . In Chapter 6 , I detailed the importance of NOX and ROS to the formation and turnover of integrin - based focal adhesions ( section 6 . 4 . 3 ) . Disruption of ROS production altered integrin - mediated motility in several cell types ( Basuroy et al . , 2010 ; Abdelsaid and El - Remessy , 2012 ; de Rezende et al . , 2012 ; Datla et al . , 2014 ) . Not only does integrin guide early axons , but it also patterns the growth of axons at later stages . Since both Rac and integrin have strong connections to redox signaling , terminal RGC migration and early axonogeneis could be disrupted in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants . 7 . 2 . 4 Intraretinal axon guidance RGC axons extend along the vitreal surface directly toward the optic disc , the point at which axons turn and exit the eye . The layer containing RGC axons is known as the inner fiber layer . There are several cues and substrate molecules that help to guide axons toward the optic disc and simultaneously prevent axons from growing into adjacent retinal layers . Repulsive , peripheral gradients of slit2 and CSPGs coordinate to drive growth inward toward the optic disc ( Brittis et al . , 1992 ; Zolessi et al . , 2006 ) . A gradient of Shh along with the growth permissive substrate of neuronal cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) attracts growing axons to the disc ( Brittis and Silver , 1995 ) . Additionally , cells 151 at the optic disc express netrin - 1 and the chemokine SDF - 1 that act as attractive cues ( Li et al . , 2005 ; Stacher Horndli and Chien , 2012 ; Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ) . Slit1 / 2 are strongly expressed by the lens and apical retinal layers to prevent axons from straying outside the IFL ( Zolessi et al . , 2006 ) . All of these molecules act in concert to guide RGC axons to the optic disc . At this stage of our research , it is important to consider the redox regulation of all steps during eye and ON development to decide which events by be sensitive to NOX mutations . However , intraretinal axon guidance does not seem to be affected in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants . This may be because disruptions in early developmental events mask a guidance phenotype , but the presence of normal appearing ONs in the mutants suggests otherwise . Nonetheless , I will briefly describe possible targets for redox regulation during intraretinal axon guidance . Of the aforementioned guidance molecules , NCAM is a promising candidate for NOX - mediated signaling . As detailed in Chapter 6 and repeated above , some components of adhesion complexes are known to be redox sensitive . NOX2 subunits have been found to colocalize with focal adhesion proteins ( Wu et al . , 2005 ) . While much of this work is focused specifically on integrin - based adhesions , our lab has found colocalization of NOX2 and p40 phox at apCAM - based adhesion sites in Aplysia ( Munnamalai et al . , 2014 ) , and others have identified a connection between NOX2 and VCAM ( Kokovay et al . , 2012 ) . Another possible redox - mediated signal is cytokine SDF - 1 . Cytokines are a class of secreted , small molecules that are classically associated with inflammatory signaling ( Zhang and An , 2007 ) . NOX - derived ROS are a well - established component of the inflammatory response . While there is nothing to directly link SDF - 1 with NOX - 152 mediated signaling , it is worth noting that cytokines and NOX are often identified in the same inflammatory signaling pathways ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . 7 . 2 . 5 Axons exiting the eye As RGC axons reach the optic disc they make a 45° turn and exit the back of the retina . As more axons reach this point , they fasciculate to form a single bundle , the ON ( Stenkamp , 2015 ) . As described above , netrin - 1 acts locally to attract RGC axons to the optic disc ( Deiner et al . , 1997 ) . Once axons reach the disc , netrin - 1 converts from an attractive to a repulsive cue ( Hopker et al . , 1999 ) . This conversion is mediated by the presence of laminin - 1 at the optic disc which lowers the amount of cAMP in growth cones . This change in cAMP levels transforms the growth promoting netrin - 1 signal into an inhibitory signal , and drives the axons toward the midline ( Hopker et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to the netrin - 1 / laminin - 1 signaling axis , the expression of pax6 and surface presentation of NCAMs facilitate the bundling of axons into a single ON ( Manuel et al . , 2008 ; Tai et al . , 2010 ) . The phenotypes observed in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants are not indicative of defects in optic disc turning or axon fasciculation . However , there are several signaling molecules with potential redox implication involved in this process . I have detailed the involvement of ROS and / or NOX in the regulation of Pax6 and CAMs in previous sections . However , laminin is uniquely involved in optic disc turning , and therefore has not been mentioned . Laminins are large , extracellular matrix proteins that provide structural support for tissues as well as participate in cellular signaling ( Beck et al . , 1990 ) . One group reported that treatment of tumor cells with H 2 O 2 improved 153 adhesion efficiency to laminin ( Vilas - Boas et al . , 2016 ) . While this study was not linked to NOX , it adds to the list of adhesion / matrix proteins whose signaling pathways involve ROS . 7 . 2 . 6 Guidance at the optic chiasm After exiting the eye , RGC axons extend to the midline where , in zebrafish , the ONs completely cross and extend toward the contralateral tectum ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ) . This crossing event is mainly mediated by the restricted expression of repulsive slit and semaphorin to prevent axons from straying into adjacent tissues ( Hutson and Chien , 2002 ; Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ; Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ) . The establishment of repulsive slit - expressing regions within the tissue is mediated by the presence of heparin sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) and SDF - 1 ( Chalasani et al . , 2007 ; Wright et al . , 2012 ) . In addition to the repulsive cues , VEGF acts as an attractive cue for RGC axons at the midline ( Erskine et al . , 2011 ) . While we did not focus specifically on axons crossing at the chiasm , nox2 / cybb - / - mutants do not appear to harbor any defects in this area . Nonetheless , there is at least one unique redox sensitive target involved in this event . The protein core of some HSPGs can be directly modified by oxidation . The authors of one study reported that perlecan , an endothelial matrix component , can be modified by ROS derived from myeloperoxidase ( Rees et al . , 2010 ) . Redox modification of this HSPG altered its ability to promote cell adhesion in epithelial cell culture models . This suggests yet another matrix adhesion protein whose signaling is redox sensitive . 154 Potential redox regulation of VEGF and SDF - 1 , also involved in chiasm crossing , was discussed in preceding sections , so that information will not be repeated here . 7 . 2 . 7 Guidance from the chiasm to the tectum In teleost fish , axons that have completed midline crossing at the chiasm extend dorsorostrally toward their final targets in optic tectum . This distance between the chiasm and the tectum is known as the optic tract . Similar to other parts of ON development , growth through the optic tract is controlled by repulsive cues flanking the tract and attractive cues emanating from the target region . In this case , the repulsive cues include integrins ( Stone and Sakaguchi , 1996 ) , Tenascin - R ( Becker et al . , 2003 ) , Shh , CSPGs and slits ( Erskine and Herrera , 2014 ) . FGF acts as a positive cue to attract RGC axons toward the tectum ( Stenkamp , 2015 ) . Once RGC axons reach the tectum , they form synapses in a retinotopic fashion ( Fadool and Dowling , 2008 ) . This means that axons from specific regions of the retina innervate specific regions of the tectum . Within the optic tract , dorsal and rostral RGCs axons are sorted , and this process is dependent on HSPGs ( Poulain and Chien , 2013 ) . Once in the tectum , opposing gradients of ephrins and Eph receptors refine target selection in a fashion that mimics retinal topography ( Frisen et al . , 1998 ) . RGC axons are mistargeted in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants . Axons are not confined to the OT and extend to adjacent midbrain regions . This could be due to defects in midbrain formation , but could also result from disruption of RGC axon guidance . Therefore , it is valuable to consider which signals that pattern tectal innervation may also be redox sensitive . 155 The involvement of ROS in integrin , FGF and HSPGs signaling has been detailed one or more of the previous sections . However , ephrin signaling is unique to the tectum , and has not been discussed previously . One study found that inhibition of integrin - based cell adhesion by ephrinA1 was dependent on the downregulation of Rac1 . The authors went on to show that this was mediated by the redox - dependent inactivation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase ( Buricchi et al . , 2007 ) . While this study does not directly implicate NOX , the involvement of Rac1 and the redox inactivation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase strongly suggest a role for NOX - derived ROS in ephrin - mediated signaling . This means that it is reasonable to speculate that Eph / ephrin - based target selection in the tectum could be disrupted in nox2 / cybb - / - mutants . 7 . 2 . 8 Summary of potential redox signaling in optic nerve development The preceding sections describe vertebrate , specifically zebrafish , ON development in some detail , and highlight signaling pathways that potentially involve NOX - derived ROS or redox signaling in general . Table 7 . 1 summarizes the cues and other proteins with potential connections to redox signaling for each section above . As stated previously , nox2 / cybb - / - mutant phenotypes likely rule out the involvement of NOX2 / CYBB in certain events ( i . e . crossing at the chiasm ) . However , RGC fate determination , early axonogenesis and axon guidance in the tectum are good candidates based on the phenotypes observed and the presence of redox sensitive signaling pathways . 156 7 . 3 Future directions for the zebrafish project Chapter 1 introduced a number of studies that show the involvement of NOX in neurodevelopment . Some focused on declines in cognitive ability ( Pao et al . , 2004 ; Kishida et al . , 2006 ) while others detail the well - established role of ROS in stem cell maintenance or neuronal maturation ( Dickinson et al . , 2011 ; Forsberg et al . , 2013 ; Forsberg and Di Giovanni , 2014 ; Olguin - Albuerne and Moran , 2015 ) . One report Table 7 . 1 : Redox sensitive events during eye and optic nerve development ‘Unknown’ refers to redox - mediated pathways in which no source of ROS has been identified . ‘NOX’ indicates that no specific isoform has been implicated . * Ephrin signaling is mediated by Rac1 - dependent generation of ROS .

Yet another investigated ROS in brain development , but did not establish a direct link to any NOX isoform ( Coyoy et al . , 2013 ) . My study is the first to directly assess the impact of a specific NOX on neurodevelopment and axon outgrowth . The results suggest a functional role for NOX in this process . However , many questions remain regarding when , where and how NOX - derived ROS are involved the differentiation and / or growth of axons . The next section suggests strategies to address these questions . In addition , I propose approaches to study the impact of NOX on overall development and morphogenesis . 7 . 3 . 1 Further characterization of Nox mutant lines In Chapter 5 , I described the use of gRNAs against all four zebrafish Nox isoforms . However , I only detail the development and testing of nox2 / cybb mutant lines . In fact , we have developed mutant lines for all of the Nox isoforms , and can predict the domains that remain in the mutant proteins ( Figure 7 . 2 ) . As these lines are already developed , future experiments should be designed to assess the impact of Nox1 , 5 and DUOX mutants on development . The first steps would be to cross the heterozygous mutants , genotype the resulting embryos and look for morphological changes that appear only in heterozygous or homozygous mutants . From there , studies similar to those described in Figures 5 . 4 and 5 . 5 could be done to address the effect of Nox mutants on ON and OT development . 158 Further genetic and molecular characterization should be done on all of the lines . If the mutant lines are to be distributed to the community or placed in a repository , it will be necessary to sequence the genomes of each line . This can be done at the Purdue Genomics Core facility . A complete genome would also confirm the absence of any unpredicted off - target mutagenesis . There are still no suitable antibodies against zebrafish Nox proteins , but we have tested some potential antibodies with varying degrees of success . The identification of specific antibodies would allow for proper characterization of the mutant proteins via Western blot and / or immunoprecipitation . The presence or absence of co - precipitating regulatory subunits would address the binding capacity of mutant Nox proteins . This is an important question given that inactive mutant proteins that retain the ability to bind regulatory subunits could act as dominant negatives , and this could change the way we approach future experiments . The introduction of dominant negatives into cultured cells or whole embryos would also be a useful knockdown strategy in the future . Figure 7 . 2 : Protein domains from all Nox mutant lines Wild type and mutant domain structures for all of the Nox isoforms are shown . Elements are color - coded and the legend is shown at the bottom - right . 159 Functional characterization can be done by cloning and expressing wild type and mutant zebrafish Nox proteins in cultured eukaryotic cells . Standard ROS activation assays using luciferase reporters could be used to measure ROS production . One example is the ROS - Glo™ H 2 O 2 Assay from Promega ( Cat . G8820 ) . The type of cells used in the assay would need to be chosen carefully . Eukaryotic cells would be necessary due to the glycosylation of NOX proteins ( Brandes et al . , 2014 ) . Cell types that do not express endogenous NOX would require the co - transfection of additional subunits while cells expressing endogenous NOX might not be sensitive to the introduction of mutant NOX proteins . This is another reason to investigate the ability of mutant proteins to act as dominant negatives . While this series of experiments would be labor intensive , the wild type and mutant constructs would have may uses for other projects . 7 . 3 . 2 Specifying the role of Nox in retinal and optic nerve development As described in the preceding sections , NOX - derived ROS may play a role in several events during RGC development and ON growth . The challenge is to determine which of these events is disrupted in nox2 / cybb mutants and how Nox - derived ROS mediates this specific process . One approach to accomplish this would be to deactivate Nox during specific developmental stages and assess the impact on RGC differentiation and ON development . Application of Nox inhibitors allows for this type of precise temporal control , but lacks isoform specificity . A better method was recently introduced that allows for temporally controlled CRISPR - mediated mutagenesis ( Yin et al . , 2015 ) . The authors describe the use of heat shock promoters to drive expression of Cas9 while 160 gRNAs are expressed ubiquitously . The result is the generation of mutations at discrete timepoints . The advantages are obvious , but this approach requires the construction of new fish lines that express specific gRNAs for each target gene . This can be laborious and time - consuming . However , I would recommend two approaches to improve efficiency . First , we can use our gRNAs that have already been proven to be specific and efficient . This saves time in validating a new set of tools . Second , I recommend initial screening experiments by injecting gRNAs into lines expressing heat shock - inducible Cas9 . This would result in the ubiquitous expression of gRNA with temporally controlled expression of Cas9 . However , this approach would not require extensive time and labor investment , and would allow the user to screen several gRNAs prior to constructing lines . In addition to temporal control , it is also desirable to have spatial control of Nox function . One method to obtain spatial and temporal restriction would be intravitreal injection of Nox inhibitors . Since the RGCs lie at the vitreal surface of the retina , they are more sensitive to substances injected in the vitreous space . Intravitreal administration of ouabain has been shown to selectively impair the innermost retinal neurons ( Fimbel et al . , 2007 ) . I suggest a similar approach to selectively inhibit Nox in RGCs . However , this would be limited to early developmental events since RGC axon pathfinding outside of the intraretinal space is unlikely to be affected by inhibitor treatment in the vitreal space . Spatial or cell - type specificity is commonly achieved using transplantation assays ( Detrich et al . , 2010 ) . I propose to transplant mutant RGCs or whole eye primordia into wild type hosts and track RGC specification and ON outgrowth throughout development . Depending on the methods used , we can eliminate potential interference from non - cell autonomous sources of Nox . This approach would require that donor cells be labeled , so I 161 suggest the use of mutant lines that have been crossed into Tg ( ath5 : GFP ) backgrounds . The transplant could also be reversed , wild type RGCs into a mutant host , to assess the RGC - independent functions of Nox . A similar approach was used to study the function of zebrafish DUOX in regenerating peripheral nerves ( Rieger and Sagasti , 2011 ) . A final method for achieving cell - type specificity is the generation of CRISPR mutants using a gene - specific promoter to drive Cas9 expression ( Ablain et al . , 2015 ) . I propose to use this method to generate mutations in RGCs . However , it may also be useful to develop lines that express Cas9 in other retinal cell types . Again , I would recommend the use of our validated gRNAs for building the new lines , and screening the different gRNAs by injecting them into embryos that express Cas9 in a specific subset of cells . The drawback of this approach is the complete lack of temporal control . Mutations are generated early in development and carried throughout development . It is advisable to pair this approach with temporally controlled mutagenesis to achieve a more comprehensive set of results . 7 . 3 . 3 Nox in axon guidance In Chapter 6 , I introduced a number of ways to investigate the role of Nox in axonal growth and guidance . A simple way to enhance those studies would be to perform the experiments with neurons derived from Nox mutant embryos . This would eliminate the need for inhibitor applications , and would be especially useful for determining upstream guidance cues that use ROS as an intermediate signal . I would expect specific isoform mutants to be insensitive to redox - controlled cues . 162 While I propose that the initial experiments into axon guidance should be done using in vitro culture systems , there are some methods to address axon guidance in vivo . One way is to track single axons from transplanted RGCs ( see above ) . Time - lapse imaging of transplanted mutant axons yields insights into the cell - autonomous role of Nox in axon guidance . However , this is very low throughput , and transplantations can be technically challenging . So this approach should be used in combination with more robust methods . Previous studies have introduced approaches for labeling single axons in vivo without the need for difficult transplantations . The authors injected a small amount of plasmid encoding a neuron - specific EGFP into single - cell zebrafish embryos . This produced mosaic labeling and allowed for single axon tracking ( St John and Key , 2012 ) . A subsequent study then used the mosaic labeling strategy to study guidance during forebrain development with single axon resolution ( St John et al . , 2013 ) . I propose to use a similar strategy to label single RGCs in the retina of Nox mutants . Using an RGC - specific promoter we could drive the expression of a fluorescent reporter to track axon outgrowth . Alternatively , we could drive expression of the ROS biosensors discussed in Chapter 6 in RGCs to simultaneously quantify ROS levels and track single axons . The cell type - specific CRISPR mutagenesis described above requires the synthesis of plasmid constructs encoding the gRNA and Cas9 gene along with requisite promoters . Most of these constructs also include a fluorescent tag to track mutagenesis in vivo . In addition to using these constructs for the generation of lines , we could use them to mosaically label embryos . This would result in mutagenesis and labeling of single RGCs within an otherwise wild type embryo . Using this approach , we could investigate 163 the cell - autonomous role of Nox in RGCs without constructing novel lines or performing laborious transplantations . 7 . 3 . 4 Nox in general development All of the approaches outlined in the preceding sections may be combined with immunolabeling and in situ hybridization ( ISH ) to characterize the impact of Nox mutations on tissues within and outside of the eye . We have already begun a project using ISH to mark the development of several early tissues in wild type and nox2 / cybb mutants . We aim to use a set of seven , validated ISH probes to mark neural crest cells , blood cell progenitors , mesodermal progenitors , heart , several brain regions , retina , RGCs , somites and macrophages ( see Table 7 . 2 ) . We will label wild type and mutant embryos with these probes at 16 , 24 and 36 hpf to compare the extent and pattern of development in all these tissues . To achieve the desired throughput for this project , we will use an ISH method published previously ( Thisse and Thisse , 2008 ) . I anticipate that the results of this project will inform future studies into novel roles for Nox in early development . For some of the anatomical targets listed above , we could supplement or substitute ISH with antibody labeling . Again , we have developed a list of suitable antibodies that label early tissues ( Table 7 . 2 ) . In the eye , we can determine the impact of Nox mutations on retinal lamination using antibodies that mark specific retinal layers . Alternatively , we can make use of a new line of transgenic fish called Zebrabow ( Brainbow ) that uses multicolor labeling strategies to trace single cell lineages as well as single axon outgrowth ( Pan et al . , 2013 ) . This would be useful to address the impact of 164 Nox mutations on overall brain development , retinal architecture and axon outgrowth simultaneously . Table 7 . 2 : Gene targets for developmental analysis Tissues listed are not comprehensive and may vary with developmental stage . ‘ + ’ and ‘ - ’ refer to the availability of validated in situ hybridization probes or antibodies . The role of Nox in angiogenesis , vascular function and disease is well documented ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ; Drummond and Sobey , 2014 ) . Therefore , it is not surprising to observe cardiovascular defects in Nox mutant zebrafish . Pericardial edema first appears between 50 and 72 hpf in mutant embryos and appears to precede any defects in heart development . However , additional experiments focused specifically on cardiac development are needed to support this assertion . Nonetheless , edema seems to Gene Tissues ISH probe ( + / - ) Antibody ( + / - ) cdh5 Vasculature , pericardium + + crestin Neural crest , brain regions , pharyngeal arches + - ets1 Hematopoetic mesoderm , neural crest , vascualture + - gata1a Mesoderm , primative blood , vasculature + - gltscr1 Brain regions , eye , hematopoetic mesoderm + - jph2 Heart , somites , myotomes + - kdrl Vasculature + + mab21l2 Retina , tectum , hindbrain + - mpx Macrophages + + myl7 Heart , pericardium + - myod Somites , muscle + + pak1 Brain regions , retina , RGCs + + pax2a Hindbrain , mesoderm , spinal neurons + + pax6a Early brain , eye primordium , hindbrain , retina + + pax7 Neural crest , muscle progenitors - + ppp1r13ba Brain regions , myotomes , blood + - sall2 Diencephalon , MHB , limited spinal cord ( 19 - 30 hpf ) + - spi1b Hematopoetic mesoderm , macrophages , eye , blood + + 165 be the first cardiovascular insult , but this presents a problem since edema is a symptom of several distinct cardiovascular defects ( Miura and Yelon , 2011 ) . The challenge is to delineate what first induces pericardial edema , and what developmental defects occur as a result . Pericardial edema is commonly caused by heart valve leakage , vascular malformations , leaks in the vascular walls and over secretion of fluid by cells of the pericardium . I propose using several labeling strategies to screen for these defects in Nox mutants . First , we can use ISH and immunolabeling to visualize early heart and vascular development ( see Table 7 . 2 for markers ) . Second , we can cross the Nox mutant lines with transgenic lines carrying fluorescent reporters in vascular tissues . One example is the fli1 : GFP transgenic line that labels blood vessels throughout development ( Lawson and Weinstein , 2002 ) . Finally , we can label vasculature and test for leakage by directly injecting fluorescent dye into the bloodstream . This technique is called microangiography ( MAG ) , and is routinely used to label blood vessels and the heart in zebrafish embryos ( Hoffman et al . , 2012 ) . I have conducted preliminary MAG experiments by injecting fluorescently labeled dextran into the sinus venosus at 48 hpf . I have imaged vasculature throughout the body in wild type embryos ( Figure 7 . 3A - B ) , but only eye vasculature in nox2 / cybb - / - embryos ( Figure 7 . 3C - E ) . These experiments appear to show additional fluorescent signals that could indicate increased angiogenesis or vascular leakage within the eye of mutant embryos ( Figure 7 . 3D - E , red arrowheads ) . In addition , the blood vessels of the eye in mutant embryos appear to be swollen ( Figure 7 . 3D - E , red arrows ) . However , the injection protocol needs to be standardized , and the results quantified before making any meaningful comparisons . 166 Figure 7 . 3 : Homozygous nox2 / cybb mutants have defects in eye vasculature ( A - B ) 48 hpf embryos injected with fluorescent dextran showing the anterior ( A ) and medial ( B ) regions . ( C - E ) High - magnification views of eye vasculature in wild type ( C ) and nox2 / cybb mutant embryos ( D - E ) . Dorsal ( dv ) , nasal ( nv ) and ventral ( vv ) veins are indicated . Mutants exhibited vascular swelling ( red arrows ) and additional labeling that may indicate increased angiogenesis or vascular leakage ( red arrowheads ) . MCeV = medial cerebral vein , AA = aortic arch , ISeV = intersegmental vessels , DA = dorsal aorta , CV = cardinal vein , YSE = yolk sac extension . Scales are indicated in A and C . In vertebrates , the pharyngeal arches ( PA ) are derived from neural crest cells , and often in zebrafish PA malformations can result from defects in neural crest migration or differentiation ( Schilling et al . , 1996 ) . Nox is known to mediate the survival and differentiation of neural crest cells ( Lee et al . , 2014 ) , so defects in PA arch formation may be expected in Nox mutants . Alcian blue is staining the most common method of labeling the PA in zebrafish , and I have conducted preliminary labeling studies on nox2 / cybb mutant embryos ( Figure 7 . 4 ) . Mutants appear to have all PA components , but they are underdeveloped and shifted toward the posterior . I propose advancing these 167 studies by optimizing the labeling protocol and quantifying the extent and type of PA malformations . We can then compare these results to previously characterized PA defects to predict the signaling pathways that are disrupted in our mutants . An excellent catalog of PA defects and their causative mutations has previously been published ( Schilling et al . , 1996 ) . Figure 7 . 4 : Homozygous nox2 / cybb mutants have defects in craniofacial development 5 day old wild type ( A - A’ ) and nox2 / cybb gRNA I ( B - B’ ) and gRNA II ( C - C’ ) mutants labeled with Alcian blue to mark cartilage . Elements of the seven pharyngeal arches are labeled . First arch derivatives are Meckle’s cartilage ( Mk ) and the palatoquadrate ( pq ) . Second arch derivatives are the basihyal ( bh ) , ceratohyal ( ch ) and hyosymplectic ( hys ) . The gill arch derivates are the basibranchials ( bb ) and ceratobranchials I - V ( cb i - v ) . The dorsal - most structure is the ethmoid plate ( eth ) and the cartilage of the pectoral fins is also shown ( pec ) . Lateral views also show the pterygoid process of the quadrate ( pty ) and the auditory capsule ( aud ) . 168 7 . 4 Concluding remarks The current study presents evidence that NOX activity is important for the outgrowth of cultured neurites derived from Aplysia and zebrafish neurons . NOX inhibition slows outgrowth , and NOX2 was directly identified in Aplysia growth cones . There is even suggestion that NOX may be involved in cell adhesions within these growth cones . The in vivo studies showed that nox genes are expressed broadly throughout the zebrafish central nervous system , and that perturbations or mutations in nox genes cause defects in retinal development and axon targeting in the optic tectum . Future studies should be aimed at discerning the role of NOX in specific tissues and developmental events . The strategies outlined above would allow for a more complete characterization of the role NOX enzymes play in retinal development . In addition , these experiments may provide new insights into roles for NOX enzymes beyond the eye and brain . The combination of in vitro approaches in cultured neurons with in vivo strategies in zebrafish affords unique opportunities to completely characterize cellular signaling pathways that use NOX - derived ROS as intermediate signals . Carefully devised , thoughtful experiments meshing these experimental strategies will be extremely informative , and may reveal novel insights into NOX biology that would not otherwise be attainable .
