Using the 1994 Carnegie Mellon survey on industrial research and development ( R & D ) in the United States , we develop and test a simple structural model in which the patenting and licensing decisions are jointly deter - mined . We ﬁnd that increases in the effectiveness of patent protection increases licensing propensity , but only when the ﬁrm lacks specialized complementary assets required to commercialize new technologies . In contrast , for ﬁrms with specialized complementary assets , increases in patent effectiveness increase patenting propensity but reduce the propensity to license . We present systematic cross - industry empirical support for the proposition that intellectual property protection is a key determinant of the vertical boundaries of the ﬁrm and the market for technology but that its impact is mediated by a ﬁrm’s ownership of specialized complementary assets .

Introduction Over the last two decades , technology - related alli - ances , such as contract research and development ( R & D ) , R & D joint ventures , and especially technol - ogy licensing , have grown rapidly . Estimates for the 1980s suggest that such alliances account for as much as 10 % – 15 % of total civilian R & D in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries ( Arora et al . 2001 , p . 43 ) . Both start - up and established ﬁrms in industries such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals , semiconductors , instruments , and chemicals have relied extensively on licensing to appropriate rents from their innovations . In pharma - ceuticals , 38 % of the new chemical entities approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration from 1963 to 1999 were licensed ( DiMasi 2000 ) . Market - based licensing of chemical processes by established ﬁrms such as Union Carbide , BP , Shell , and even Dow and DuPont is also well documented ( Arora and Fosfuri 2003 , Fosfuri 2004a ) . 1 Similarly , over the last two decades , patenting in the United States has grown rapidly , due in part to the 1 Patent - based technology transactions are , of course , not new . Lamoreaux and Sokoloff ( 1998 ) document the extensive trade in patent rights in the United States in the late 19th century . Also , data availability limits the focus of this paper to technology licens - ing , but the market for technology has other dimensions as well , including strategic alliances and mergers and acquisition . increasing importance of patent - intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals . However , part of the increase in growth is due to increases in patent propensity in sectors such as semiconductors and electronics ( Kim and Marschke 2004 ) , in which patents have not tra - ditionally been seen as very important , partly reﬂect - ing the rise of ﬁrms specializing in chip design ( Hall and Ziedonis 2001 ) . Changes in the legal environ - ment have been important as well . In 1982 , the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was established to make patent law more uniform ; indirectly , it also strengthened it . Patents have also become a growing preoccupation of management ( Grindley and Teece 1997 , Rivette and Kline 1999 ) . It is plausible that these trends are related . In partic - ular , the link between patenting and licensing can be analyzed in light of the challenges faced by sellers and buyers of technology , highlighted by Arrow ( 1962 ) and ﬂeshed out in greater detail by Mowery ( 1983 ) , Williamson ( 1991 ) , and others . Arrow ( 1962 ) pointed out that a potential licensee would naturally wish to verify the quality of the invention before paying for it . However , once the inventor discloses the inven - tion , the potential licensee would have little incentive to pay for it . Patents are a possible solution because the invention can be disclosed without fear of imita - tion . Licensing is possible , in principle , even without patents . Anton and Yao ( 1994 ) provide a theoretical 293 Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing 294 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS model of how an invention protected only through secrecy can be licensed by threatening a licensee who reneges with enhanced competition through fur - ther disclosure . Arora ( 1996 ) provides a model and supporting empirical evidence wherein tacit know - how can be bundled with other inputs ( which could include patents ) in a self - enforcing contract . How - ever , although plausible , the empirical importance of these alternative mechanisms remains unknown . Thus , Teece ( 1986 ) has argued that licensing is mainly recommended if the innovator enjoys strong patent protection and lacks complementary assets such as manufacturing and marketing . Implicit in Teece’s pre - scription is the notion that access to complementary assets is difﬁcult—typically they cannot be “rented , ” and acquiring them is costly and time consuming . The available evidence ( reviewed in § 2 ) of the impact of patents , or their effectiveness , on licensing is limited , typically conﬁned to studies of individual industries , and the empirical ﬁndings are inconclu - sive . This paper shows that one key reason for the mixed evidence , which has been overlooked by pre - vious studies , is that the impact of patent protection on licensing is mediated by specialized complemen - tary assets required for commercializing innovations : Effective patents are more likely to encourage licens - ing among ﬁrms that lack such assets compared with ﬁrms that possess them . Patent protection can affect licensing through two routes : the patenting decision ( because nonpatented inventions are difﬁcult to license ) and the licensing decision conditional on patenting . By estimating a system of simultaneous equations , where the patenting and licensing deci - sions are jointly determined , we are able to identify the differential impact of patent effectiveness on both the probability of licensing and licensing conditional on patenting and to disentangle the mediating role of specialized complementary assets . We use data from the 1994 Carnegie Mellon survey on U . S . industrial R & D ( Cohen et al . 2000 ) . This paper also contributes to the literature on the role of patents in appropriating rents from innova - tion . Surveys by Mansﬁeld ( 1986 ) , Levin et al . ( 1987 ) , and Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) suggest that patents are fea - tured as an effective appropriability strategy in only a few industries . Arora et al . ( 2003 ) estimate that only for a small fraction of innovations do patents provide greater net expected returns . We contribute to this literature by analyzing how the payoffs to patenting and licensing are conditioned by special - ized complementary assets . Our results imply that although the strength of patent protection increases the returns to patenting , the source of the increase is more likely to be licensing for ﬁrms lacking spe - cialized complementary assets . Our results also imply that the presence of specialized complementary assets enhances the value of patent protection . However , our paper does not address the long - run conﬁguration of ﬁrms and industries . In particular , it cannot address fully when industries can feature a division of innovative labor ( Arora et al . 2001 ) . For this , we would have to examine how and when inno - vating ﬁrms strategically choose to acquire ( or not ) various complementary assets . The resource - based theory of the ﬁrm ( e . g . , Wernerfelt 1984 , Dierickx and Cool 1989 , Barney 1991 , Amit and Schoemaker 1993 ) suggests that ﬁrms are distinguished by capabilities that are valuable , rare , and difﬁcult to imitate . In the same spirit , we assume that ﬁrms are endowed with different levels of specialized complementary assets , at least in the short term . In § 2 , we present a simple model of patenting and licensing decisions , the hypotheses to be tested , and the empirical speciﬁcation . Section 3 describes the data and measures used for estimation , and § 4 dis - cusses the results . Section 5 examines the robustness of the results to alternative assumptions about speciﬁ - cations and endogeneity . The conclusion follows in § 6 . 2 . Theory Development and Empirical Speciﬁcation In this section , we ﬁrst present a simple empirical model to better structure the development of our hypothesis . In particular , we posit that a ﬁrm that has developed an innovation faces four mutually exclu - sive and exhaustive options : ( 1 ) patent and license ; ( 2 ) patent and not license ; ( 3 ) not patent and license ; and ( 4 ) not patent and not license . The probabilities that any given innovation is patented or licensed are as follows : Pr (cid:1) Patent (cid:2) = Pr (cid:1) Patent and License (cid:2) + Pr (cid:1) Patent and Not License (cid:2)(cid:3) ( 1 - 1 ) Pr (cid:1) License (cid:2) = Pr (cid:1) Patent and License (cid:2) + Pr (cid:1) Not Patent and License (cid:2)(cid:4) ( 1 - 2 ) In our data , ﬁrms that do not patent rarely license . In particular , cross - tabulating our data by licensing and patenting propensities shows that less than 10 % of licensors do not patent , but nearly 33 % of nonlicen - sors do not patent ; and that only 12 % of nonpatentees license , whereas about 40 % of the patentees license . Therefore , our data strongly suggest that the presence of a patent is almost essential for licensing , and it will be difﬁcult to empirically estimate the determinants of license and not patent . Accordingly , we set Pr ( License and Not Patent ) equal to 0 in ( 1 - 2 ) and drop the 25 anomalous observations from the analysis . 2 2 Section 5 . 4 discusses the robustness of this assumption , includ - ing a more detailed examination of those cases where licensing is apparently not based on a patent . Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS 295 Let V L denote the payoff to a ﬁrm if it patents and licenses a given innovation , and V P if it patents but does not license it . Similarly , let V S denote the payoff if the ﬁrm keeps the innovation secret ( not patent ) and also does not license it . Assuming that ﬁrms choose the action with the highest payoff , we obtain Pr (cid:1) Patent (cid:2) = Pr (cid:1)V L = Max (cid:9)V L (cid:3)V P (cid:3)V S (cid:10)(cid:2) + Pr (cid:1)V P = Max (cid:9)V L (cid:3)V P (cid:3)V S (cid:10)(cid:2)(cid:3) ( 2 - 1 ) Pr (cid:1) License (cid:2) = Pr (cid:1)V L = Max (cid:9)V L (cid:3)V P (cid:3)V S (cid:10)(cid:2)(cid:4) ( 2 - 2 ) We use a linear random utility speciﬁcation , ob - tained by incorporating an additive stochastic com - ponent to each payoff , and assume that the stochas - tic terms are independent and identically distributed ( i . i . d . ) across innovations with Type 1 extreme value ( Gumbel ) distribution and are observed by the ﬁrm but not the econometrician . The licensing and patent - ing probabilities 3 are ( cf . McFadden 1973 ) Pr (cid:1) Patent (cid:2) = (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P (cid:2)(cid:12) (cid:1) (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V S (cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:3) ( 3 - 1 ) Pr (cid:1) License (cid:2) = (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L (cid:2)(cid:12) (cid:1) (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V S (cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:3) ( 3 - 2 ) Pr (cid:1) License (cid:1) Patent (cid:2) = (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L (cid:2)(cid:12) (cid:1) (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P (cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:4) ( 3 - 3 ) Our data are at the ﬁrm level , and we do not observe whether a speciﬁc innovation is licensed or patented . Rather , we observe the proportions of inno - vations a ﬁrm patents or licenses . Thus , although our setup is similar to a multinomial logit , our depen - dent variables are not binary variables but propor - tions . We treat the probability of an event as the true mean of the observed proportion . It is also obvious that we cannot identify the individual payoffs , only the differences . By dividing both the numerator and denominator of the probabilities by exp (cid:1)V S (cid:2) , we get the estimating equations Y 1 = (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2)(cid:12) (cid:1) (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2) + 1 (cid:12) + (cid:14) 1 (cid:3) ( 4 - 1 ) Y 2 = (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2)(cid:12) (cid:1) (cid:11) exp (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2) + 1 (cid:12) + (cid:14) 2 (cid:4) ( 4 - 2 ) Here , Y 1 and Y 2 are the patenting and licensing pro - pensities , V L − V S and V P − V S are made functions of 3 Note that ( 3 - 3 ) can be derived from ( 3 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) . Estimation of ( 3 - 3 ) by itself is feasible but inefﬁcient , because it would require that we drop about 25 % of the sample with zero patent propensity ( see § 5 . 3 ) . observed ﬁrm and industry characteristics discussed below , and the econometric error terms , (cid:14) 1 and (cid:14) 2 , represent sampling errors that account for the differ - ence between theoretical and empirical probabilities . 4 2 . 1 . Determinants of V L − V S , V P − V S and Implications for Patenting and Licensing Propensity Our empirical speciﬁcation makes it clear that ob - served behavior—the decision to patent or license— does not depend on the underlying payoffs in a straightforward manner . For instance , a variable that increases the licensing payoff , V L , could nonethe - less decrease licensing propensity if it increases V P sufﬁciently . Accordingly , we develop our hypotheses in two parallel tracks . We ﬁrst discuss the impacts of patent effectiveness on relative payoffs . We then develop the implications for patent and licensing propensities . The theoretical predictions are summa - rized in Tables 1a and 1b . The appendix formalizes the hypothesis developed and provides proofs . 2 . 1 . 1 . Patent Effectiveness . We use the term “pa - tent effectiveness” to mean strength of patent pro - tection . A variety of factors may drive the effec - tiveness of patents , including increases in length or breadth of protection , greater codiﬁability of knowl - edge , decreases in costs of application , and costs of disclosure ( Horstmann et al . 1985 ) . Because we cannot empirically distinguish among these , we use effectiveness as a summary measure . An increase in patent effectiveness should increase V L − V S as well as V P − V S , thus unambiguously increasing patent propensity . However , although patents are virtually always required for licensing , an increase in patent effectiveness has conﬂicting effects on the decision to license : While more effective patents increase V L , they also increase V P , so that the impact on licensing propensity is ambiguous . More effective patent pro - tection increases the net beneﬁts from licensing ( e . g . , by decreasing transaction costs or by increasing the licensor’s bargaining power ) but may also increase the opportunity cost of licensing by enhancing the payoff from the exclusive commercialization of the innovation . Indeed , the available empirical evidence is mixed . Using a sample of Massachusetts Institute of Tech - nology inventions , Gans et al . ( 2002 ) ﬁnd that the presence of patents increases the likelihood that an inventor will license to an incumbent rather than 4 Our framework assumes that the licensing and the patenting deci - sions are made at the same time . Firms may patent ﬁrst and later decide whether to license . Estimates of a sequential model yield similar results ( see § 5 . 3 ) , but , with cross - sectional data , identiﬁca - tion in the sequential model relies more heavily upon functional form assumptions .

( Hypothesis 1b ) Complementary ? − − assets × patent effectiveness ( Hypothesis 2b ) enter the product market by commercializing the invention . Anand and Khanna ( 2000 ) ﬁnd that in the chemicals sector , where patents are believed to be effective , there are more technology deals—a large fraction of these are arm’s length and involve exclu - sive licenses , a large fraction concerns future tech - nologies rather than existing technologies , and a small fraction is among related ﬁrms than for all sectors as a whole . In contrast , Cassiman and Veugelers ( 2002 ) do not ﬁnd that more effective patents encourage Belgian ﬁrms to enter into collaborative R & D arrangements . Evidence from cross - national data is also mixed . Some studies ﬁnd a positive association between patents and licensing . Yang and Maskus ( 2005 ) report a strong positive relationship between improved intel - lectural property rights ( IPR ) regimes and licens - ing by U . S . multinational corporations . Analyzing data on international technology licensing contracts of Japanese ﬁrms , Nagaoka ( 2002 ) ﬁnds that weak patent regimes are associated with an increase in the frac - tion of transfers to an afﬁliate ( such as a subsidiary ) , rather than to an unafﬁliated ﬁrm . Smith ( 2001 ) ﬁnds that U . S . ﬁrms are more likely to export or directly manufacture than to license technology in countries with weak patent regimes . A study using French data on the export of technology services ﬁnds that such exports are greater for countries with more effective patent protection , but mainly for higher - income coun - tries ( Bascavusoglu and Zuniga 2002 ) . Other studies cast doubts on the link between patent protection and the extent or form of inter - national technology licensing . Fink ( 2005 ) ﬁnds a very weak relationship using German data . Puttita - nun ( 2003 ) reports a higher response of direct invest - ment than licensing to changes in the level of IPR protection . Similarly , Fosfuri ( 2004b ) does not ﬁnd that patent protection signiﬁcantly affects the extent or composition of technology ﬂow ( as joint venture , direct investment , or licensing ) in the chemical sector . The mixed nature of the ﬁndings is further reﬂected in a recent study by Branstetter et al . ( 2006 ) . Using detailed data on the technology royalty payments received by U . S . ﬁrms and controlling for country , industry , and ﬁrm ﬁxed effects , they ﬁnd that stronger patent protection does not increase the transfer of technology by U . S . multinationals to unafﬁliated par - ties . However , it does increase the ﬂow of technology to afﬁliates . The above discussion leads us to the fol - lowing hypotheses : Hypothesis 1a . Increases in patent effectiveness in - crease V L − V S and V P − V S . The impact on V L − V P is ambiguous . Hypothesis 1b . Increases in patent effectiveness in - crease patent propensity . Increases in patent effectiveness may increase or decrease the share of licensing in patented innovations . 2 . 1 . 2 . Complementary Assets and Their Condi - tioning Role . Successful innovation requires manu - facturing , marketing , and a variety of other com - plementary assets ( cf . Teece 1986 ) . If these assets were “generic” and hence could be readily accessed through the market , they could be valuable , but their strategic importance would be limited ( e . g . , Barney 1991 , Rothaermel and Hill 2005 ) . However , manufac - turing and marketing assets required for commercial - izing an innovation are often not generic . Instead , they are specialized to the innovation and thus have limited alternative uses . Their market availability is also limited because ﬁrms tend to gain control over them to avoid potential bargaining problems . They are difﬁcult to imitate because they result from the interaction of people from different parts of a ﬁrm’s organization and are built over long periods of time ( Teece 1992 ) . Indeed , Shane ( 2001 ) ﬁnds that spe - cialized complementary assets increase the likelihood that technology will be exploited inside a ﬁrm . Con - versely , Gans et al . ( 2002 ) ﬁnd that technology start - ups ( which lack complementary assets ) are more likely to ally with incumbents in sectors where com - plementary assets are costly to acquire . In our setup ( nongeneric ) complementary assets should increase V P and V S and , as we argue below , should have little impact on V L . Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS 297 Our focus in this paper is not on this direct impact of complementary assets . Rather , we want to highlight an important interaction between a ﬁrm’s comple - mentary assets and patent effectiveness . In particular , if higher patent effectiveness implies that rivals are unable to produce close substitutes , then more effec - tive patent protection should translate into a “larger market” for the patented innovation . An innovator with specialized complementary assets should be able to proﬁt more from a larger market than an inno - vator lacking such assets . For instance , if comple - mentary assets imply that the innovative product can be produced at a lower cost or that quality can be increased at a lower cost , then this is more proﬁtable , the greater the volume of demand for the product . Thus , V P should increase faster with patent effec - tiveness for ﬁrms with specialized complementary assets . For the other payoffs , this interaction effect is absent . The payoff from not patenting , V S , cannot , by deﬁnition , vary with patent effectiveness . Similarly , the payoff from licensing , V L , should depend on the complementary assets of the licensee rather than those of the licensor . It follows that V L − V P should fall faster with patent effectiveness for ﬁrms with specialized complementary assets . Similarly , the positive impact of patent effectiveness on V P − V S is larger for ﬁrms with the specialized complementary assets , but the impact on V L − V S is unaffected . Insofar as the ownership of specialized complemen - tary assets also increases licensee bargaining power in licensing negotiations ( e . g . , Gans et al . 2002 ) , the impact of complementary assets on V L is positive ( rather than zero ) so that the impact of the interac - tion between patent effectiveness and complementary assets on V L − V P is ambiguous . The empirical model does allow for a specialized complementary asset to affect V L , but the empirical estimates show that the estimate of such impact , if any , is small . 5 The consideration of the interaction effect on rela - tive payoffs is also critical to evaluate the impact of patent effectiveness on licensing probabilities . If the positive interaction effect on V P is sufﬁciently strong , both the propensity to license and the share of licens - ing in patented innovations will increase faster ( or decrease more slowly ) with patent effectiveness for ﬁrms lacking the relevant specialized complementary 5 Additional support for this assumption comes from the empirical estimates of the direct impact of complementary assets on licens - ing propensity . If the bargaining power effect were negligible , the direct impact ought to be negative . Our results indicate that the impact of complementary assets on both licensing and the share of patented innovations that are licensed is indeed negative . The structural estimates indicate that complementary assets decrease V L − V P as well as V L − V S . In sum , the results are consistent with a small or negligible impact of complementary assets on V L . assets . To summarize , we will test the following hypotheses : Hypothesis 2a . The impact of increasing patent effec - tiveness on V L − V S is the same for ﬁrms with different levels of specialized complementary assets . However , the impact of increasing patent effectiveness on V P − V S is higher for ﬁrms owning specialized complementary assets . Hypothesis 2b . The impact of patent effectiveness on both licensing and the share of licensing in patented inno - vations is weaker for ﬁrms with specialized complementary assets . 3 . Data and Variables The data used come from the Carnegie Mellon sur - vey ( CMS ) on industrial R & D ( Cohen et al . 2000 ) . The population sampled is that of all R & D labs located in the United States conducting R & D in manufac - turing industries as a part of a manufacturing ﬁrm . The sample was randomly drawn from the eligi - ble labs listed in the Directory of American Research and Technology ( Bowker 1995 ) or belonging to ﬁrms listed in Standard and Poor’s Compustat , stratiﬁed by three - digit SIC industry . R & D lab managers were asked to answer questions with reference to the “focus industry”—deﬁned as the principal industry for which the unit was conducting its R & D . Valid responses were received from 1 , 478 R & D units , with a response rate of 54 % . The data refer to the period 1991 – 1993 . After trimming for outliers and dropping observations with missing data for the variables of interest , we obtain a ﬁnal sample of 757 observations . 6 Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis . Also , although we use the term “ﬁrm” for the unit of analysis , the unit of analysis is the business unit within the parent ﬁrm , operating in the “focus industry” of the responding R & D lab . 3 . 1 . Endogenous Variables Licensing Propensity . The CMS asks respondents to state the percentage of their R & D projects over the last three years that were undertaken with the objec - tive of earning licensing revenues . ( Projects could have multiple objectives . ) There were ﬁve response categories : < 10 % , 10 % – 40 % , 41 % – 60 % , 61 % – 90 % , and > 90 % . We used the midpoints of each response cat - egory . For the ﬁrst category , it is likely that most respondents actually meant zero . Thus , we assigned all respondents in the ﬁrst category zero licensing 6 This also reﬂects the exclusion of business units with more than 10 employees , R & D units reporting more than 50 patent applica - tions per million dollars of R & D , and those reporting an R & D bud - get of less than or equal to $ 100 , 000 . Including very small units does not affect our results but is consistent with Arora et al . ( 2003 ) and Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) .

Our ex ante measure thus excludes cross - licensing deals and transactions that take place in the shadow of infringement suits ( Hall and Ziedonis 2001 ) . Because we lack information on technology buyers , our measure of licensing propensity may be better than the actual number of licensing deals . Note that licensing propensity is not separately available for products and processes . Patent Propensity . The CMS asks respondents for the percentage of product and process innovations for which they applied for patents in the period 1991 – 1993 in the United States . We computed a weighted average of product and process patent propensities using the percentage of R & D effort devoted to prod - uct and process innovations , respectively , as weights , as reported by the CMS respondents . 3 . 2 . Explanatory Variables Patent Effectiveness . The CMS asks respondents to indicate the percentage of their product and pro - cess innovations for which patent protection had been effective in protecting their ﬁrm’s competi - tive advantage from those innovations during the 7 This procedure increases the sample probability of licensing con - ditional on patenting , because only patentees can indicate whether licensing was a motive for patenting . However , using the midpoint of the ﬁrst category gives similar results . prior three years . There were ﬁve mutually exclu - sive response categories for product and process innovations separately : < 10 % , 10 % – 40 % , 41 % – 60 % , 61 % – 90 % , and > 90 % . We computed a weighted aver - age of the product and process scores ( using mid - points ) , with the percentage of R & D effort devoted to product and process innovations as weights , to con - struct patent effectiveness . To inform our interpretation of this measure , we analyzed the relationship between reasons to patent and not to patent and the respondents’ patent effec - tiveness scores , using an ordered probit model ( Arora et al . 2003 ) . The results indicate that patent effec - tiveness is indeed a broad summary measure of the various costs ( such as information disclosure ) and beneﬁts of patenting ( including preventing imi - tation , facilitating technology negotiations , or build - ing patent fences ) . In § 5 , we report results where we instrument for patent effectiveness to address the possibility that ﬁrms that patent a lot also perceive patents to be effective , or that there are unmeasured differences in knowledge that drive both patenting and patent effectiveness . 8 Complementary Assets . We focus on specialized manufacturing capability . The CMS provides a mea - sure for the frequency of face - to - face interaction between personnel from R & D and production , mea - sured in a four - point Likert scale . 9 We constructed a binary variable , complementary asset , which takes value 1 if R & D and manufacturing personnel interact daily ( the median value is weekly interaction ) . In general , measuring the degree of specialization is difﬁcult but , as Teece ( 1992 ) suggests , complemen - tary assets often arise from the interaction and learn - ing over time of people from different parts of a ﬁrm’s organization . This is especially relevant for the interaction with R & D , which typically requires orga - nizationally embedded interpersonal and interfunc - tional activities ( Zhao et al . 2005 ) . Previous studies have used measures of manufacturing or sales force ( e . g . , Tripsas 1997 , Nerkar and Roberts 2004 ) or ﬁnan - cial assets as measures of complementary capabili - ties ( e . g . , Helfat 1997 ) . Our measure does not simply reﬂect a ﬁrm’s ownership of complementary manu - facturing capabilities , because all ﬁrms in our sample have manufacturing capability . Further , we control 8 Our patent effectiveness measure does not take into account the skewed nature of the net returns from patenting ( Schankerman and Pakes 1986 , Scherer and Harhoff 2000 ) . This is relevant only inso - far as one suspects that even as the percentage of innovations for which patents are effective increases , the average return to patent - ing falls . 9 Respondents were asked , “How frequently do your R & D person - nel talk face to face with personnel from the Production , Marketing or Sales , and Other R & D units functions ? ” Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS 299 for size , which also proxies for the manufacturing and marketing assets . Indeed , the extent of interac - tion between the R & D and manufacturing functions measures how important it is for the innovating ﬁrm to also have manufacturing capability—the quintessence of the notion of specialized complementary assets . 10 There are other possible—and broader—measures of specialized complementary assets , such as the importance of complementary manufacturing and marketing assets in appropriating the proﬁts from innovations ( cf . Cohen et al . 2000 , Shane 2001 , Gans et al . 2002 ) . In the online appendix ( http : / / mansci . pubs . informs . org / ecompanion . html ) we show that their use in the empirical model yields qualitatively similar—albeit less precise—results than those pre - sented here . Finally , it is plausible that ﬁrms that intend to license may choose more modular organiza - tions , with fewer interactions between R & D and man - ufacturing . We probe the robustness of our results to such endogeneity in § 5 . Business Unit Size . We controlled for size using business unit size , measured by the log of the num - ber of business unit employees . We also experimented with ﬁrm size , measured by the log of the total employees of the unit’s parent ﬁrm , as well as both measures of size , and obtained similar results . Nature of Knowledge . Tacit technology is costly to transfer , implying lower licensing payoffs ( Teece 1977 ) . Typically , technologies that are strongly science based , especially in sectors such as chemicals , molec - ular biology and genetics , and in some cases , semi - conductors , are less likely to be tacit , and patents are more likely to be effective ( Arora and Gambardella 1994 , Winter 1987 , Anand and Khanna 2000 ) . The CMS provides various measures of the degree to which the ﬁrm’s knowledge is science based and thus likely to be codiﬁable or nontacit . 11 We use three such variables . One measure , labeled importance of basic sci - ence , represents the maximum score computed across all the ﬁelds , except the engineering ﬁelds and the medical and health science ﬁeld . A second measure , labeled importance of medical science , represents the importance of the medical and health science ﬁeld 10 Of course , some industry - speciﬁc studies have the advantage of being able to use ﬁner measures of specialized complementary assets : Tripsas ( 1997 ) uses font libraries in her study of the type - setting industry ; Thomke and Kuemmerle ( 2002 ) use therapeutical area - speciﬁc chemical libraries in pharmaceuticals , and Penner - Hahn and Shaver ( 2005 ) use the stock of fermentation patents as a measure of complementary manufacturing capabilities for Japanese pharmaceutical ﬁrms . 11 Respondents were asked to rate ( on a four - point Likert scale ) the importance of different ﬁelds of science and engineering in terms of their contribution to a ﬁrm’s R & D activity during the most recent three years . alone . A third measure is the percentage of R & D effort devoted to basic research , deﬁned as scientiﬁc research with no speciﬁc commercial objective . Basic research is arguably more codiﬁable than applied research . For example , basic biotech research has highly codiﬁable output , and there is ample evi - dence of contract R & D and technology licensing . On the other hand , advances in internal combustion engines are still based on a great deal of trial - and - error type research , the results are difﬁcult to cod - ify effectively , and there is relatively little contract R & D or technology licensing . Even in biopharmaceu - ticals , fermentation and other production technologies tend to be tacit . The share of basic research ( and per - haps the importance of basic science ) has an alterna - tive , although not mutually exclusive , interpretation as well . As Nelson ( 1959 ) points out , basic scientiﬁc research is more likely to result in useful knowledge that a ﬁrm is itself unable or unwilling to commercial - ize or the use of which may be much broader than the ﬁrm’s domain of operation . In such cases , licensing is a natural means of appropriating the beneﬁts of such research . 12 Technological Competition . Technological rivalry is likely to raise the payoff to patenting and may also raise the opportunity cost of licensing , particularly if there is a prospect of valuable knowledge leaking out ( e . g . , Hill 1992 , Ceccagnoli 2005 ) . We used the mid - point of the number of technological rivals , which in the CMS is reported as a categorical variable in the fol - lowing ranges : 0 , 1 – 2 , 3 – 5 , 6 – 10 , 11 – 20 , or > 20 . 13 Industry Fixed Effects . We included seven indus - try dummy variables to control for industry effects , such as licensing and patenting norms . 14 Other Controls . We used binary variables indicat - ing whether the ﬁrm owning the R & D lab was global ( also sells products in Japan or Europe ) , foreign ( the parent is located abroad ) , or public ( publicly traded ) . 12 Licensing agreements in biotechnology indicate that being basic is not an intrinsic barrier to licensing and closeness to science allows commercially relevant milestones to be speciﬁed using scientiﬁc terms , such as the characterization of a protein or the structure of a receptor . 13 Technological rivals are deﬁned as the number of U . S . competi - tors in the focus industry capable of introducing competing inno - vations that can effectively diminish the respondent’s proﬁts from an innovation . This variable represents each respondent’s assess - ment of his or her focus industry conditions , and thus varies across respondents within an industry . 14 The industry dummies are based on the following group - ings : chemicals , petroleum and plastics ( SIC 28 , 29 , 30 , exclud - ing 283 ) , biotechnology and pharmaceuticals ( SIC 283 ) , computer and electronics ( SIC 357 and 36 ) , machinery ( SIC 35 , excluding 357 ) , transportation ( SIC 37 ) , instruments ( SIC 38 , excluding 384 ) , and medical instruments ( SIC 384 ) . Note that the results presented below are robust to the use of more disaggregated industry deﬁni - tions .

OLS Results We ﬁrst present single equation OLS results , reported in Table 3 ( with and without interactions ) . The results are consistent with the theory developed in the pre - vious section , suggesting that patent effectiveness has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on patent propen - sity ( Hypothesis 1b ) . We also ﬁnd a positive and signiﬁcant effect on licensing propensity , consistent with Hypothesis 1b , as well . The average elastici - ties of patenting and licensing , with respect to patent effectiveness , are about 0 . 5 and 0 . 6 , respectively . The effect of the interaction between patent effectiveness and the complementary assets variable on licensing propensity is negative and signiﬁcant , consistent with Hypothesis 2b . 4 . 2 . Structural Estimates , Marginal Effects , and Elasticities The reduced - form estimates have a number of short - comings . They are inefﬁcient because the residuals are heteroscedastic . The predicted outcome cannot be interpreted as a predicted probability because predic - tions could lie outside the ( 0 – 1 ) limits . Most of all , the estimated coefﬁcients only provide qualitative infor - mation on the payoffs . 15 Thus , these estimates can - not directly test Hypotheses 1a and 2a . In contrast , in addition to being more precise , structural estimates allow us to disentangle the impact of the explanatory variables on V L − V S and V P − V S , separately . This is an advance over the literature because it allows us to understand the channel through which intellectual property protection affects licensing . Table 4 presents the structural estimates of ( 4 - 1 ) and ( 4 - 2 ) , where we impose cross - equation restric - tions , namely that V L − V S and V P − V S are present in the denominators in both equations and that the numerator in both equations shares the coefﬁcients from V L − V S . We use the general method of moments ( GMM ) , which allows for potential correlation across errors of the two equations and corrects for possible heteroscedasticity ( cf . Gallant 1987 , pp . 442 – 451 ) . The estimates for V L − V P , reported in the second column of Table 4 , are obtained as the difference between the estimates of V L − V S and V P − V S . For the control variables , Table 4 shows that mea - sures of the codiﬁability of knowledge have a pos - itive and signiﬁcant effect on licensing payoffs , as expected . We also ﬁnd that foreign , global , and public ﬁrms have substantially higher payoffs from 15 For instance , the right - hand side of the patenting equation can be thought of as reﬂecting the weighted average of V L − V S and V P − V S , with ﬁrms with higher licensing propensities having higher - than - average weights on V L − V S , relative to ﬁrms with lower licensing propensities .

In other words , more effective patents do lead to more licensing , but this is mostly driven by the indirect effect of patent effectiveness on the proba - bility of patenting . This is more easily seen , noting that Elasticity of Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) = Elasticity of Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) + Elasticity of Pr (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) . The elasticity of the conditional probability is − 0 (cid:4) 08 , and the elasticity of patenting is 0 . 51 , so that the elasticity of the probability of licens - ing with respect to ( w . r . t . ) patent effectiveness is 0 . 43 . The central result of this paper relates to the impact of the interaction between patent effectiveness and complementary assets on licensing payoffs and probabilities , related to Hypotheses 2a and 2b . The structural estimates of the parameter related to the interaction term , shown in Table 4 , clearly indicate a negative and signiﬁcant impact on V L − V P and a pos - itive and signiﬁcant impact on V P − V S . These results conﬁrm Hypothesis 2a , namely that ﬁrms with spe - cialized complementary assets derive greater value from more effective patent protection , but not through licensing . The cross - partial effect of patent effectiveness and complementary assets on the licensing probabilities is shown at the bottom of Table 5b . To compute this effect , we ﬁrst divide the sample into ﬁrms with high and low specialized complementary assets ( accord - ing to our measure ) . For each group , we then com - pute the marginal effects of patent effectiveness on Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing 302 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS the respective licensing probabilities evaluated at the group mean . Consistent with Hypothesis 2b , we ﬁnd that licensing is less responsive to patent effective - ness , both for patented innovations and for all inno - vations , for ﬁrms with specialized complementary assets relative to ﬁrms that do not possess them ( the difference is signiﬁcant at the 5 % level ) . Because we control for business unit size , these results are not merely reﬂecting scale effects and suggest that the ownership of specialized complementary assets crit - ically conditions the impact of patent protection on licensing . Recall that Hypothesis 2b does not require that an increase in patent effectiveness actually decreases licensing for ﬁrms with high complementary assets , but merely that any increase be smaller than that for ﬁrms with low complementary assets , although such a result is obviously consistent with it . Table 6 , which reports the marginal effects and elasticities of patent effectiveness on the licensing probabilities , shows that ﬁrms with high specialized complemen - tary assets and higher effectiveness of patent protec - tion are more likely to patent but less likely to license their patented innovations than ﬁrms with high spe - cialized complementary assets but low patent effec - tiveness . Firms with low specialized complementary assets and high patent effectiveness are more likely to license , but they are also more likely to license their patented innovations than ﬁrms with low specialized complementary assets and low patent effectiveness . In sum , the results suggest that ﬁrms with spe - cialized complementary assets react to stronger patent protection by patenting more , but using the patents to enhance the payoff from commercializa - tion . Firms lacking specialized complementary assets also respond by increasing patenting but are more likely to use patents as a basis for licensing . 5 . Sensitivity Analysis 17 We now evaluate the sensitivity of our results to pos - sible endogeneity and alternative speciﬁcations . 5 . 1 . Potential Endogeneity of Complementary Assets We have assumed , in the spirit of the resource - based theory , that complementary assets are exoge - nous . However , it is possible that unobserved factors that reduce licensing costs or increase licensing pay - off may also reduce complementarity between man - ufacturing and R & D . 18 To address this concern , we 17 See the online appendix for further details of results presented in this section . 18 In a linear speciﬁcation , this would imply that the coefﬁcient on complementary assets would have a negative bias in the licensing equation . In a nonlinear speciﬁcation such as ours , the bias cannot be judged as readily .

Thus , if one accepts that the location of the lab is a long - term decision , colocation between R & D and manufacturing is a source of exogenous variation in the frequency of interactions between R & D and manufacturing . 19 As Tables 7a and 7b show , all our main results are conﬁrmed , although the standard errors are typically larger . The interaction between complementary assets and patent effectiveness continues to have a nega - tive and signiﬁcant effect on V L − V P and a positive and signiﬁcant effect on V P − V S ( Columns VI and X , Table 7a ) . The marginal effect of patent effectiveness on licensing propensity is positive and decreases from 0 . 09 to 0 . 06 between ﬁrms with low and high spe - cialized complementary assets ( Column II , Table 7b ) . Similarly , the marginal effect of patent effectiveness on the share of licensing in patented innovations is lower for ﬁrms with low specialized complementary assets ( Column VI , Table 7b ) . 5 . 2 . Endogeneity of Patent Effectiveness and Other Possible Biases It is possible that R & D managers from labs with high patent propensity also tend to report higher patent effectiveness to “justify” their patenting behav - ior and related costs . However , even after controlling for industry - ﬁxed effects , the average patent effective - ness score when the respondent is from a non - R & D function ( about 13 % of the sample ) is only 0 . 002 lower than the average score of respondents from the R & D lab , a very small and insigniﬁcant difference . 19 The correlation coefﬁcient between complementary assets and colocation is 0 . 2 , signiﬁcant at the 1 % level .

Standard errors are in parentheses . ∗∗ , ∗ , a : Signiﬁcantly different than zero at the 0 . 01 , 0 . 05 , and 0 . 10 conﬁdence levels , respectively . A different concern is that the reported patent effectiveness simply reﬂects reporting biases ( e . g . , managers who , for some reason , favor patenting also report patents to be more effective ) or differ - ences in knowledge base or technical opportunity . To address this , we also estimated a speciﬁcation instru - menting for patent effectiveness , using two sets of instruments . One is the industry average of patent effectiveness at the level of the primary industry of the respondent’s parent ﬁrm . 20 Patent effectiveness , a self - reported measure of the net beneﬁts from patenting , reﬂects both “endogenous” variation in the strength of patents , such as the patentability of technology , as well as “exogenous” variation related to the busi - ness unit’s parent ﬁrm’s patenting culture or to the shared resources available to enforce patents at the ﬁrm level . It is the latter that we hope to capture through the instrument . The instrument is valid in the sense that the effectiveness of patents in the industry of the parent ﬁrm should not have any direct impact on patenting or licensing payoffs of the business unit and should only have an indirect effect through patent effectiveness . 20 Roughly half of the business units belong to an industry different from the primary industry of the parent ﬁrm . Similarly , insofar as location is a long - term choice , differences in the litigation environment across fed - eral districts should affect behavior only through how effective managers perceive patents to be . We use the average time to resolution of patent cases dur - ing 1990 – 1993 and its standard deviation , the aver - age success rate of patent holders , and the number of terminated patent cases in the district court where the respondent lab is located as additional instruments for patent effectiveness . 21 Tables 7a and 7b present the estimates for payoffs and propensities , respectively , where we instrument for patent effectiveness and complementary assets . The results are qualitatively unchanged , although the standard errors are larger . 5 . 3 . Additional Speciﬁcations Controlling for R & D . We measure licensing pro - pensity as the percentage of R & D invested with the objective of licensing . For a given share of innovations 21 Source : “Federal Court Cases : Integrated Data Base , 1970 – 1994 , ” Federal Judicial Center , Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research . The time to resolution is computed as the number of months between the date on which a case was ﬁled in a district court and its termination by any means ( e . g . , settlement , dismissal , judgment ) . Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing 304 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS that are licensed , the percentage of R & D invested for licensing will decrease with the level of R & D . Sim - ilarly , a ﬁrm that has more innovations than it can develop in house will be more likely to license . How - ever , controlling for this possibility by including R & D or R & D intensity ( R & D / sales ) as controls does not change the results . Indeed , R & D or R & D intensity has only a small and statistically insigniﬁcant impact on patenting and licensing payoffs . Sequential Decision Making . Our model assumes that the licensing and patenting decisions are taken simultaneously . However , some patenting decisions may be made before the licensing opportunities have materialized . We also estimated a speciﬁcation where the licensing decision is made after the patenting deci - sion and obtained similar results to those presented here ( see the online appendix ) . The estimated vari - ance of the difference between random components of the payoffs is small , which suggests that our ﬁrm - level cross - sectional data are poorly suited to the task of estimating a model of sequential decision mak - ing . The analysis of the sequential stages of patenting and licensing decisions requires analysis with differ - ent data and is left for future research . Correlation in Errors . Our model assumes that the unobserved , stochastic components in payoffs are mutually uncorrelated . We also estimated two dif - ferent speciﬁcations that relax this assumption—the nested logit and the multinomial probit speciﬁcations ( estimated using proportions and the GMM method ) . The estimated correlation coefﬁcient between unob - served errors ( e . g . , allowing correlation between V L and V P , or V P and V S ) is not signiﬁcantly different from zero , suggesting that the main results of the paper are robust to relaxation of such assumption . Alternatively , one can estimate the equation for the probability of licensing conditional on patenting ( 3 - 3 ) as a single equation , using the observed licens - ing propensity divided by the patent propensity as a dependent variable . If V L and V P were correlated , the conditional probability would be a function of (cid:1)V L − V P (cid:2) / (cid:1) 1 − (cid:18)(cid:2) , with (cid:18) reﬂecting the strength of the correlation and varying between 0 and 1 ( Maddala 1983 , pp . 70 – 72 ) . The estimated coefﬁcient of the inter - action term in the single structural equation is still negative , as predicted by Hypothesis 2a , but is statis - tically insigniﬁcant . The fall in precision in the esti - mates is likely to be due to the exclusion of the nonpatentees , or about 25 % of the sample . Within - Group Estimation . We also estimated the model within the groups of ﬁrms with low and high complementary assets , allowing all coefﬁcients to vary across groups , and found that the central result of the paper , summarized in Table 6 , is even stronger . The estimated elasticity of licensing w . r . t . patent effectiveness is 0 . 7 ( 0 . 02 ) for low ( high ) com - plementary asset ﬁrms . Similarly , the elasticity of the share of licensing in patented innovations is 0 . 2 (cid:1) − 0 (cid:4) 5 (cid:2) for low ( high ) complementary asset ﬁrms . 5 . 4 . Licensing Without Patents We further analyzed the 25 cases that involved pos - itive licensing propensity but zero patent propensity . Two - thirds of these involved public ﬁrms , for which 10Ks and annual reports were available , and a closer examination revealed that most of these ﬁrms typi - cally did not engage in technology licensing , but may be licensing software or trademarks . In a small num - ber of cases , it appeared that ﬁrms had applied for patents , but not during 1991 – 1993 , the survey time frame , which implies measurement error as the cause of the apparent anomaly . Including those 25 observa - tions in the sample and assigning them a null propen - sity to license does not change our results . Although , in principle , ﬁrms that patent may still license some of their unpatented innovations , data limitations do not allow us to investigate this possibility further . 6 . Conclusion The ability of ﬁrms to appropriate the returns from their innovations is a key driver of the willingness of ﬁrms to invest in innovative activity . In recent years , some ﬁrms appear to have resorted to technology licensing as a way of appropriating the returns . But even when licensing is feasible , it is well known that the market for technology suffers from various imper - fections . Effective patents can ameliorate some of these imperfections . However , more effective patents also increase the payoff from commercialization , mak - ing it important to quantify the impact of patent effec - tiveness on licensing . We analyze how patenting and licensing strategies are related and how patent effectiveness and com - plementary assets condition the use of patenting and licensing by ﬁrms to appropriate rents from innova - tion . We ﬁnd that increases in patent effectiveness indirectly affect licensing by increasing the propen - sity of ﬁrms to seek patent protection . However , this also decreases the proportion of patented innovations that are licensed , implying a smaller net increase in licensing propensity . Our results highlight the importance of the inter - action between patent effectiveness and a ﬁrm’s ownership of specialized complementary assets in conditioning licensing decisions . We argue that inso - far as complementary assets are difﬁcult to acquire or imitate , stronger patent protection will increase the payoff to commercialization relative to licensing . Indeed , we ﬁnd that higher patent effectiveness elicits much larger increases in licensing from ﬁrms lacking specialized complementary assets . Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS 305 Thus , our study also helps reconcile conﬂicting empirical evidence of the impact of patent protec - tion on licensing . For instance , studies undertaken using samples of small ﬁrms or start - ups , which are less likely to have specialized complementary assets ( e . g . , Gans et al . 2002 ) , are also more likely to ﬁnd a stronger impact of patent effectiveness on licens - ing . Conversely , studies of cross - national technology licensing by large multinationals are less likely to ﬁnd an impact of patent effectiveness on licensing ( e . g . , Fosfuri 2004b ) . Similarly , studies focusing on patented innovations are more likely to ﬁnd only a small impact of the strength of patents on licensing , because they neglect the effect on the propensity to patent . These results point to the need to better understand the interplay between different strategic instruments available to ﬁrms in their quest to appropriate rents from innovation . In particular , it seems important to move beyond the short - term adjustment model inher - ent in the present study by relaxing the assumption of exogenous investments in complementary assets . For instance , although our ﬁndings are consistent with the view that technology start - ups lacking manufactur - ing or marketing assets should license their innova - tions when patent protection is effective , other options may be available . Limited access to such assets could be obtained through alliances with established part - ners , as in pharmaceuticals , or through indepen - dent foundries , as in semiconductors . Alternatively , a start - up may decide to invest in in - house manu - facturing and marketing capability , as ﬁrms such as Genentech and Amgen appear to have done . When a strategy of acquiring complementary assets is supe - rior to one of licensing or one of alliances is thus an important area for future research . Our ﬁndings point to the importance of understanding better when the long - term industry conﬁguration can feature ver - tical “technology specialists” ( Arora and Gambardella 1994 ) and when , instead , innovators must battle with incumbents .

As argued in the text , it is intuitive that increases in (cid:19) increase both V L − V S and V P − V S . The impact on V L − V P is , however , ambiguous ( Hypothesis 1a ) . Pr (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) = 1 1 + B (cid:3) B = 1 exp (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2)(cid:4) Because both (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2) and (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2) are nondecreasing in (cid:19) , it follows that B is decreasing in (cid:19) , and so Pr ( Pat ) is increasing in (cid:19) . d Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) d(cid:19) = Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) A (cid:2) exp (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2)d(cid:1)V L − V P (cid:2) d(cid:19) + d(cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2) d(cid:19) − 1 (cid:3) (cid:3) A = exp (cid:1)V P − V S (cid:2) + exp (cid:1)V L − V S (cid:2) + 1 (cid:4) Because the sign of d(cid:1)V L − V P (cid:2) / d(cid:19) is ambiguous , so is the overall expression . Similarly , it also follows that the share of licenses in patented innovations could either increase or decrease with respect to patent effectiveness . This demon - strates Hypothesis 1b . (cid:1) Proof of Hypothesis 2a . By deﬁnition , dV S / d(cid:19) = 0 , because patent effectiveness can have no effect if the inno - vation is not patented , and hence d 2 V S / d(cid:23)d(cid:19) = 0 . Similarly , dV L / d(cid:23) = 0 because if the innovation is licensed , what mat - ters is the complementary assets of the licensee , not those of the innovator . In the text , we argued that d 2 V P / d(cid:23)d(cid:19) > 0 because stronger patents are more valuable to ﬁrms owning the specialized complementary assets . In what follows , the intuition is formalized using standard models of both prod - uct and process innovations with asymmetric ﬁrms and imitation . Process Innovation . In a standard two - stage model of R & D competition ( cf . d’Aspremont and Jacquemin 1988 , De Bondt et al . 1992 , and Ceccagnoli 2005 ) , in stage 1 two ﬁrms (cid:1)i(cid:3)j(cid:2) choose the amount of cost reducing R & D , the cost of which is quadratic in R & D , and in stage 2 , ﬁrms compete à la Cournot in a homogeneous product market with linear demand (cid:1)p = 1 − Q(cid:2) . Marginal costs are equal to c i = c − (cid:23) i − R i − (cid:1) 1 − (cid:19) j (cid:2)R j for ﬁrm i , where (cid:23) i is an index of ﬁrm i complementary assets , and (cid:1) 1 − (cid:19) j (cid:2) represents the fraction of rival j ’s R & D , which is imitated by ﬁrm i , thus reducing ﬁrm i ’s costs , with 0 ≤ (cid:19) j ≤ 1 . A greater (cid:19) j reﬂects stronger patent protection for ﬁrm j . Proﬁts from commer - cialization and patenting for ﬁrm i are equal to V Pi = (cid:1)q ci (cid:2) 2 − 1 2 R 2 i (cid:3) with q ci = 1 3 (cid:11) 1 − 2 c i + c j (cid:12)(cid:4) It is easily veriﬁed that , for any given level of R & D , (cid:31) 2 V Pi (cid:31)(cid:23) i (cid:31)(cid:19) i = 49 R i > 0 (cid:3) which formalizes Hypothesis 2a for the case of process innovations . Arora and Ceccagnoli : Patent Protection , Complementary Assets , and Firms’ Incentives for Technology Licensing 306 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 293 – 308 , ©2006 INFORMS Product Innovation . An innovation may also be quality improving ( rather than merely cost reducing ) . This can be dealt with using a standard model of vertical differentiation ( e . g . , Shaked and Sutton 1982 ) . The buyer’s utility function is vx − p , where x is the quality of the product , p is the price , and v is the buyer’s willingness to pay for quality . Typically , v is assumed to be uniform , and for simplicity , we let it be uniform between (cid:11) 0 (cid:3) 1 (cid:12) . Let the innovator’s quality be x and the rival’s quality be x (cid:8) (cid:3)x > x (cid:8) . The ( constant ) marginal costs of production are , respectively , c and c (cid:8) , and the prices chosen are p and p (cid:8) , respectively . Let " x = x − x (cid:8) , and deﬁne " p and " c similarly . Assuming that the entire market is cov - ered , the demand for the innovator is given by 1 − v ∗ , where v ∗ = " p / " x . We assume that the innovator can choose the quality level by incurring a product R & D cost G(cid:1)x(cid:2) , G x > 0 , G xx > 0 , so that higher quality requires increasingly higher product R & D . Complementary commercialization assets , (cid:23) , reduce the “cost of achieving high quality , ” i . e . , G (cid:23) < 0 , G (cid:23)x < 0 . We also assume that through spillovers , rivals can partially imitate the innovator , so that x (cid:8) is an increasing function of x . Unless spillovers are perfect , the increase in the rival’s quality should be less than the increase in the innovator’s quality . Further , an increase in patent effec - tiveness , by reducing spillovers , reduces x (cid:8) . Speciﬁcally , we assume that (cid:31)x (cid:8) / (cid:31)x = 1 > $ > 0 , and (cid:31)x (cid:8) / (cid:31)(cid:19) < 0 . The proﬁt function for the innovator is given by (cid:1)p − c(cid:2)(cid:1) 1 − v ∗ (cid:2) − G(cid:1)x(cid:2) , and the innovator chooses price and quality to maximize proﬁts . Let % (cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:2) represent the maximized proﬁt function . Then , (cid:31) % (cid:31)(cid:23) = − G (cid:23) (cid:3) (cid:31) 2 % (cid:31)(cid:23)(cid:31)(cid:19) = − G x(cid:23) (cid:31)x (cid:31)(cid:19) (cid:4) Because G (cid:23)x < 0 , a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for (cid:31) 2 % / (cid:31)(cid:23)(cid:31)(cid:19) > 0 is (cid:31)x / (cid:31)(cid:19) > 0 , i . e . , the innovator’s quality increases with patent effectiveness . We show below that this is indeed true . Case 1 : Rivals Are a Competitive Fringe . We assume that imitators are a competitive fringe so that they price at marginal cost , i . e . , p (cid:8) = c (cid:8) . Assuming an interior opti - mum for x ( so that % xx < 0 ) , it follows that (cid:1)(cid:31)x / (cid:31)(cid:19)(cid:2) = (cid:1)(cid:31) 2 % / (cid:31)x(cid:31)(cid:19)(cid:2) / (cid:1) − % xx (cid:2) . Thus , the sign of (cid:1)(cid:31)x / (cid:31)(cid:19)(cid:2) is the same as the sign of (cid:31) 2 % / (cid:31)x(cid:31)(cid:19) . Substituting in the optimum price , one can write the innovator’s proﬁts , % = " x / 4 + (cid:1) " c(cid:2) 2 / 4 " x − " c / 2 − G(cid:1)x(cid:2) . Thus , (cid:31) % / (cid:31)x = (cid:1) 1 − $ (cid:2) / 4 (cid:9) 1 − (cid:1) " c(cid:2) 2 / (cid:1) " x(cid:2) 2 (cid:10) − G x , so (cid:31) 2 % / (cid:31)x(cid:31)(cid:19) = (cid:11)(cid:1) 1 − $ (cid:2)(cid:1) " c(cid:2) 2 / 2 (cid:1) " x(cid:2) 3 (cid:12)(cid:1) − (cid:31)x (cid:8) / (cid:31)(cid:19)(cid:2) > 0 . Case 2 : Strategic Price Competition . We continue to assume that the innovator selects quality , and this also determines the rival’s quality through spillovers . Unlike Case 1 , the innovator and its rival set prices strategically . Thus , we have a two - stage game , wherein the innovator chooses the qual - ity level ( i . e . , product R & D level ) , determining its quality and that of its rival , and in stage 2 , both compete by setting prices . One can show that in the second stage , the innova - tor’s proﬁts , % , can be written as % = " x / 9 + (cid:1) " c(cid:2) 2 / 9 " x − 8 " c / 9 − G(cid:1)x(cid:2) . Note that this has the same form as the proﬁt function in Case 1 , and thus it is easy to show that (cid:31) 2 % / (cid:31)x(cid:31)(cid:19) > 0 . This formalizes Hypothesis 2a for the case of product innovation . (cid:1) Proof of Hypothesis 2b . As noted in the text , the rela - tionship between payoffs and behavior is nonlinear so that second - order impacts of variables on payoffs do not translate directly into impacts on behavior such as licensing propensity . Note that d 2 Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) d(cid:23)d(cid:19) = 1 Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) d Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) d(cid:19) d Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) d(cid:23) + Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) (cid:4) d Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) d(cid:23) (cid:2) dV P d(cid:19) − dV L d(cid:19) (cid:3) − dV P d(cid:19) d Pr (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) d(cid:23) + (cid:11) Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) − Pr (cid:1) Pat (cid:2)(cid:12)d 2 V P d(cid:23)d(cid:19) (cid:5) (cid:4) The ﬁrst term on the right - hand side is indeterminate in theory but negative in our empirical results . The second term depends on three subterms inside the square brackets , of which only the third is predicted to be negative by our theory ( by Hypothesis 2a ) ; the other two are indeterminate . Given that Pr ( Lic ) is always lower than Pr ( Pat ) , a sufﬁcient condition for d 2 Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:2) / d(cid:23)d(cid:19) to be negative is that the pos - itive interaction effect , d 2 V P / d(cid:23)d(cid:19) , is sufﬁciently strong . The impact on the share of licensing in patented inno - vations is also indeterminate in theory and becomes neg - ative if the interaction effect between patent effectiveness and complementary assets presented in Hypothesis 2a is sufﬁciently strong : d 2 Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) d(cid:19)d(cid:23) = d Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) d(cid:23) (cid:2) dV L d(cid:19) − dV P d(cid:19) (cid:3) · (cid:11) Pr (cid:1) NotLic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) − Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2)(cid:12) − Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) Pr (cid:1) NotLic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) (cid:2) d 2 V P d(cid:19)d(cid:23) (cid:3) (cid:4) The ﬁrst term of this difference is indeterminate in theory , although our empirical results imply that it is positive but small ( insigniﬁcantly different from zero ) . The second term is positive , because the cross - partial is positive . Therefore , a sufﬁcient condition for d 2 Pr (cid:1) Lic (cid:1) Pat (cid:2) / d(cid:23)d(cid:19) to be nega - tive is that the positive interaction effect , represented by d 2 V P / d(cid:23)d(cid:19) , is sufﬁciently strong , so that the second term outweighs the ﬁrst .
