369 Research Article Introduction Invasive tumoral or transformed cells grown on a flat extracellular matrix ( ECM ) substratum such as gelatin , fibronectin and others , extend proteolytically active protrusions into the matrix from their ventral surfaces ; these protrusions have been termed invadopodia ( Chen , 1989 ; Mueller and Chen , 1991 ) . Invadopodial protrusions are actin - rich structures enriched in integrins , tyrosine kinase signaling machinery , soluble and membrane proteases including matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) , and actin - associated proteins ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 1999 ; Chen , 1996 ; Kelly et al . , 1994 ; Monsky et al . , 1994 ; Mueller et al . , 1992 ; Nakahara et al . , 1997 ) . These features define them as powerhouses for the focal degradation of the ECM , made possible by a tight integration between the signaling , membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal machineries ( reviewed by Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . In recent years , many molecular players have been defined . Invadopodia formation was shown to rely on the ubiquitous member of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein family ( N - WASP ) ( Mizutani et al . , 2002 ) , an activator of the actin filament nucleator Arp2 / 3 complex ( Olazabal and Machesky , 2001 ) . Another study presented a morpho - functional approach to the understanding of invadopodia , reporting that Dynamin 2 , an atypical GTPase implicated in the control of actin - driven cytoskeletal remodeling events and membrane transport , is required for focalized matrix degradation at invadopodia ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , by a correlative confocal light - electron microscopy approach , invadopodia were found to be organized into a previously unrecognized structure consisting of a large invagination of the ventral plasma membrane surface in close spatial relationship with the Golgi complex ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) . ADP - ribosylation factor 6 , a GTPase known to be involved in the regulation of actin assembly at the plasma membrane ( Schafer et al . , 2000 ) , was also implicated in invadopodia formation and cell invasion ( Hashimoto et al . , 2004 ; Tague et al . , 2004 ) . Later , a combination of RNA interference and dominant - negative mutant expression studies confirmed the importance of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex in invadopodia formation , and suggested a role for some of their upstream regulators Nck1 , Cdc42 and WIP ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . Cortactin ( Olazabal and Machesky , 2001 ; Weed and Parsons , 2001 ) was also suggested to be localized and to function at invadopodia ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 1999 ) ; this has been confirmed with RNA interference ( Artym et al . , 2002 ; Clark et al . , 2007 ; Webb et al . , 2007 ) . More recently , analysis of the fine dynamics of invadopodia has shown that these are stable , persistent structures and that actin turnover is rapid and displays a striking comet - like organization resembling microbial pathogen - associated actin tails ( Baldassarre et al . , 2006 ) . Cortactin is an actin - binding protein and is involved in the coordination of cell migration , cytoskeleton remodeling and Invadopodia are proteolytically active protrusions formed by invasive tumoral cells when grown on an extracellular matrix ( ECM ) substratum . Although many molecular components have been defined , less is known of the formation and regulation of invadopodia . The multidomain protein cortactin , which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerisation , is one such component , but how cortactin is modulated to control the formation of invadopodia has not been elucidated . Here , a new invadopodia synchronization protocol is used to show that the cortactin N - terminal acidic and SH3 domains , involved in Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP binding and activation , respectively , are both required for invadopodia biogenesis . In addition , through a combination of RNA interference and a wide array of cortactin phosphorylation mutants , we were able to show that three convergent regulatory inputs based on the regulation of cortactin phosphorylation by Src - family kinases , Erk1 / Erk2 and PAK are necessary for invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation . These findings suggest that cortactin is a scaffold protein bringing together the different components necessary for the formation of the invadopodia , and that a fine balance between different phosphorylation events induces subtle changes in structure to calibrate cortactin function .

Human cortactin is encoded by CTTN ( formerly EMS1 ) on chromosome 11q13 , which is frequently amplified in breast , head and neck squamous carcinoma and bladder cancers ( Bringuier et al . , 1996 ; Schuuring , 1995 ) . One consequence of the gene amplification is an increase in cortactin protein levels ( Hui et al . , 1998 ) . Cortactin overexpression in vitro leads to increased motility and invasion ( Patel et al . , 1998 ) ; in vivo , it enhances the formation of bone metastases from a breast cancer cell line in a mouse model ( Li et al . , 2001 ) . Consistent with its F - actin - binding ability , cortactin primarily localizes in peripheral cell structures such as lamellipodia , membrane ruffles ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) and invadopodia ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 1999 ) . Cortactin is a multidomain protein with an N - terminal acidic domain containing a conserved DDW motif that binds and weakly activates the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ) . This is followed by a variable number of 37 amino acid repeats ( depending on the splice variant ) ( van Rossum et al . , 2003 ) constituting the actin - binding domain ( ABD ) of which only the fourth repeat is required for F - actin binding activity and has been suggested to stabilize the newly created branches between filaments ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2003 ) . A proline - rich domain ( PRD ) and a C - terminal SH3 domain follow the ABD . The latter can bind and directly activate N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . The SH3 domain of cortactin can also bind dynamin 2 , which is required for invadopodia formation ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) and this influences Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation through cortactin ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ; Krueger et al . , 2003 ) . Cortactin was originally identified as a major substrate of the Src oncogene ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) and was later confirmed to be phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to stimuli such as FGF , EGF and integrins , that induce remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Vuori and Ruoslahti , 1995 ; Zhan et al . , 1993 ) . In particular , phosphorylation on Tyr421 , Tyr466 and Tyr482 in the PRD is required for cell movement ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) and metastatic dissemination ( Li et al . , 2001 ) , possibly by inhibition of F - actin stabilization ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Cortactin can also be phosphorylated in vitro on Ser405 and Ser418 in the PRD by the extracellular - signal - regulated serine / threonine kinases ERK1 / 2 ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) . Although the precise mechanistic consequence of these regulatory events is unclear , the ability of cortactin to activate N - WASP was found to be positively regulated by ERK phosphorylation and negatively regulated by Src phosphorylation ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) , thus suggesting a potential on - off switch mechanism . More recently , the p21 - activated serine / threonine kinase ( PAK ) has been shown to phosphorylate cortactin on serine residue 113 in vitro . As a consequence , cortactin binding to F - actin was reduced suggesting a role for PAK - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin in the regulation of branched actin filament dynamics ( Webb et al . , 2006 ) . The PAK family comprises conventional PAK1 , PAK2 and PAK3 isoenzymes , each containing an autoinhibitory domain , and a group of newly discovered members PAK4 , PAK5 and PAK6 ( reviewed by Kumar et al . , 2006 ; Zhao and Manser , 2005 ) . In general , the substrates of conventional PAKs are involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and adhesion . The PAK1 gene maps to the 11q13 amplicon , the same region that contains the gene that encodes cortactin ( Bekri et al . , 1997 ) . Hence , similarly to cortactin , PAK1 overexpression has been documented in a number of cancers and T - cell lymphoma ( Balasenthil et al . , 2004 ; Carter et al . , 2004 ; Mao et al . , 2003 ; Schraml et al . , 2003 ) . Of note , cortactin was also shown to be constitutively associated with PAK1 / 2 in resting platelets . After thrombin stimulation , PAK and cortactin dissociate ( Vidal et al . , 2002 ) , therefore possibly allowing phosphorylated cortactin to trigger the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . In conclusion , the molecular complement of invadopodia and some structural aspects have been thoroughly investigated . Many studies have established key components and have centered on the actin - remodeling machinery governing invadopodia formation . Much less is known concerning invadopodia formation , dynamics and regulation . Cortactin is a complex , differentially phosphorylated protein that might act by integrating signaling cascades , cytoskeletal remodeling and membrane - trafficking events that operate at invadopodia and which are finalized towards the focal degradation of ECM components . Here , we directly investigated the role of the various cortactin protein domains in the regulation of invadopodia formation and ECM degradation , and analyzed the functional consequences of phosphorylation events modifying cortactin . We applied a quantitative approach based on RNA interference , expression of mutant proteins and selective small molecule and protein inhibitors . This was made possible through an experimental protocol based on a reversible block , followed by a synchronized wave of spontaneous invadopodia formation . Results Invadopodia synchronization The cell model used throughout this study was the invasive metastatic human melanoma cell line A375MM ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Kozlowski et al . , 1984 ) . Tumor cells placed on the appropriate ECM substrate spontaneously form proteolytically active invadopodia . Their activity can be monitored directly by observing and measuring the extent of degradation of the fluorophore - conjugated ECM substrate of choice ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 2001 ) . Hence , in some cases , and depending on the cell type , invadopodia formation and degradation of the ECM can be observed as early as 1 hour after plating the cells , even before spreading is complete . This poses specific technical and interpretive problems when applying experimental protocols that require long pretreatment times such as the transient expression of heterologous proteins ( at least 24 hours ) and even more so in RNA interference experiments ( up to 60 hours or more ) . Ideally , one would like to block invadopodia formation until satisfactory levels of transfected protein expression or downregulation of targeted proteins have been achieved , thus uncoupling cell attachment and spreading processes from invadopodia formation . We devised a protocol to solve this issue by applying a reversible block of invadopodia formation during which cell adhesion and spreading can occur , and treatments can be carried out , followed by release from the block and establishment of a synchronized wave of spontaneous invadopodia formation . To this end , we made use of the synthetic reversible broad - spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat ( or BB94 ) that functions competitively and reversibly by fitting tightly in the active site of the enzyme ( Brown , 1995 ; Brown and Giavazzi , 1995 ; Rasmussen and McCann , 1997 ) . A375MM cells were then plated directly on crosslinked fluorescent gelatin in the presence of 5 (cid:2) M BB94 and allowed to adhere and spread overnight . Cells could be kept for up to 96 hours in the presence of BB94 to allow for transfection of siRNA duplexes and Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 3 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 371 Cortactin regulates invadopodia biogenesis eventually re - expression of exogenous proteins . During this period , we observed no detectable effect on cell morphology , growth or behavior in general , but invadopodia did not form and therefore no degradation of the ECM occurred . Upon BB94 washout , the cells resumed the ability to form invadopodia and hence degrade the matrix ( Fig . 1B ) . When BB94 was added after invadopodia establishment , progression of ECM degradation was halted but invadopodia were not disassembled ( not shown ) . Cortactin is required for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation We first verified whether cortactin was required for the formation of invadopodial protrusions and ECM degradation in A375MM by siRNA - mediated knockdown of endogenous cortactin with a mix of four different duplexes specific for human cortactin . We observed a significant reduction ( about 95 % ) of cortactin levels in the siRNA - treated cells as assessed by both western blotting and immunofluorescence ( Fig . 2A - C ) . When BB94 was washed out , no invadopodia were formed and consequently gelatin was not degraded ( Fig . 2C ) in accord with previously described experiments ( Artym et al . , 2006 ) . Cortactin - depleted cells did not appear to have an obviously altered general morphology although the actin cytoskeleton acquired a slightly diffuse pattern when compared with mock - treated cells . To exclude off - target effects , we transfected a pool of four nontargeting siRNA duplexes . To further verify the specificity of the siRNA treatment we retransfected rat wild - type cortactin ( cortactin WT ) in the knocked - down cells . This restored the ability of the depleted cells to form invadopodia and degrade the ECM ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , cortactin is an essential component of the ECM degrading machinery . Cortactin acidic and SH3 domains are required for ECM degradation at invadopodia Cortactin is a multidomain protein with many binding partners . To better understand which of the many functional domains of cortactin are relevant for invadopodia function , cortactin WT and various mutated forms were transiently expressed in A375MM cells . The mutant cortactin constructs used in this study are as outlined in Fig . 3 . The N - terminal acidic Arp2 / 3 - binding domain ( NTA ) has been shown to be important for in vitro actin polymerization . Hence , to evaluate the relevance of this domain , we used an N - terminal acidic domain deletion ( cortactin (cid:3) NTA ) and a point mutant in amino acid position 22 ( cortactin W22A ) , that has been specifically shown to perturb the interaction with Arp2 / 3 ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2002 ; Weed et al . , 2000 ) . A deletion mutant ( cortactin (cid:3) SH3 ) was used to examine the relevance of the C - terminal SH3 domain ( Cao et al . , 2005 ; Krueger et al . , 2003 ; McNiven et al . , 2000 ) . Whereas overexpression of cortactin WT did not significantly affect invadopodia formation and ECM degradation compared with mock - transfected cells , transient expression of cortactin (cid:3) NTA , cortactin W22A and cortactin (cid:3) SH3 substantially inhibited both , compared with cortactin WT - expressing cells ( Fig . 4A ) . To exclude nonspecific effects of the cortactin mutants , they were transfected after cortactin knockdown ( Fig . 4B ) . None of the mutants , unlike cortactin WT , was able to rescue the invasive phenotype ( indicated by formation of invadopodia and matrix degradation ; not shown ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation Previous work has shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins by Src or Src - family tyrosine kinases ( SFK ) is required for ECM degradation at invadopodia ( Hauck et al . , 2002 ; Mueller et al . , 1992 ) suggesting a main role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the formation of functional invadopodia . Also , immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine - containing proteins from invadopodia - enriched membrane fractions revealed that phosphorylated cortactin was highly enriched in this fraction , suggesting this actin - binding protein is a potential target for SFK at invadopodia ( Bowden et al . , 2006 ) .

( A ) Triple staining of A375MM cells grown on crosslinked FITC - conjugated matrix for 16 hours and then fixed and stained with anti - cortactin ( A ) and Alexa Fluor 633 - phalloidin ( B ) , or anti - dynamin 2 ( E ) and anti - phosphotyrosine ( F ) .

Scale bars : 10 (cid:2) m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 372 To verify that SFK activity is required for invadopodia formation in A375MM cells , we plated A375MM cells directly on fluorescent gelatin - coated coverslips in the presence of BB94 . After adhesion and spreading , the cells were pretreated with the specific SFK inhibitor SU6656 for 30 minutes as well as with BB94 . The protease inhibitor was washed out and the cells incubated with SU6656 for further 3 hours and finally fixed and stained . After this treatment , A375MM cells completely failed to form invadopodia and hence degrade the ECM ( supplementary material Fig . S1A , B ) . We then evaluated the relevance of specific cortactin tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases , in invadopodia function . This was achieved by transfecting A375MM cells with a mutant in which the primary SFK - phosphorylated residue was changed to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylated cortactin ( cortactin Y421D ) and a nonphosphorylatable mutant in which three relevant tyrosines were substituted by phenylalanine ( cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F ; Fig . 3 ) . The latter mutant has been shown to act in a dominant - negative fashion in the motility of endothelial cells ( Huang et al . , 1998 ; Li et al . , 2000 ) and metastatic dissemination of breast carcinoma cells ( Li et al . , 2001 ) . We observed that cortactin Y421D was present at invadopodia and increased the ability of the transfected cells to degrade the ECM Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 3 ) Fig . 2 .

Cortactin features a N - terminal acidic domain ( NTA ) which specifically binds the Arp2 / 3 complex and is followed by a variable number of 37 amino acids repeats , the fourth of which binds F - actin . After an (cid:4) - helix of undefined function , there is a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . Finally , the C - terminal is a Src - homology 3 domain ( SH3 ) able to bind the proline - rich domain of several binding partners . The arrows indicate the positions of the mutated sites . Fig . 4 .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 373 Cortactin regulates invadopodia biogenesis more than twofold . By contrast , cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F caused more than 60 % inhibition of degradation when compared with the control cortactin WT - expressing cells ( Fig . 5A ) . A recent study has shown that the same three cortactin tyrosine residues can be phosphorylated by the Abl / Arg tyrosine kinase and that this modification is required for PDGF - induced dorsal wave formation ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . To establish whether Abl / Arg kinase activity plays a role in invadopodia formation / function , we plated A375MM cells directly on fluorescent - gelatin - coated coverslips in the presence of BB94 . After adhesion and spreading , the cells were pretreated with the specific Abl / Arg kinase inhibitor STI - 571 for 30 minutes in the continued presence of BB94 . The protease inhibitor was washed out and the cells incubated with STI - 571 for further 3 hours and finally fixed and stained . After this treatment , A375MM cells formed normal invadopodia , in terms of both number and function ( supplementary material Fig . S1E ) . This is taken to indicate that Abl / Arg kinase activity , and hence Abl / Arg - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin are not relevant for invadopodia biogenesis . To exclude nonspecific effects of the mutant cortactin forms , we verified the consequence of cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F and cortactin Y421D expression after cortactin downregulation . To this end , cells were transfected with cortactin WT , cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F and cortactin Y421D after cortactin knockdown ( Fig . 4B , C ) . The expression of cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F , as opposed to cortactin WT did not restore the potential of A375MM cells to form invadopodia and degrade the ECM ( data not shown ) , whereas the transfection of cortactin Y421D in cortactin - depleted cells induced the formation of invadopodia ( Fig . 5B ) and degraded significantly more compared with cortactin WT - expressing cells ( not shown ) . Hence , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin possibly by SFK , is required for , and stimulates , invadopodia formation and consequently matrix degradation . Serine phosphorylation of cortactin enhances ECM degradation Cortactin is phosphorylated in vitro on Ser405 and Ser418 by ERK1 / 2 ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) , which is thought to enable cortactin - N - WASP binding in vitro ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . It is not known whether ERK1 / 2 are involved in invadopodia formation . We thus took advantage of U0126 ( Favata et al . , 1998 ) , an inhibitor active on the mitogen - activated protein / ERK kinase ( MEK ) , the prime activator of ERK1 / 2 ( reviewed by Kolch , 2005 ) . We found that U0126 treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 by 80 % and reduced ECM degradation by 50 % when compared with untreated cells ( supplementary material Fig . S1D , E ) , suggesting that ERK1 / 2 activity supports invadopodia formation . To study the relevance of serine phosphorylation of cortactin in invadopodia function , we used a mutant in which the two serines known to be phosphorylated by ERK1 / 2 were substituted by aspartic acid or alanine to generate pseudophosphorylated cortactin S405 , 418D and nonphosphorylatable cortactin S405 , 418A , respectively ( Fig . 3 ) . Overexpression of cortactin S405 , 418D induced a 2 . 5 - fold increase in the ability of the transfected cells to degrade the matrix compared with control cells . Conversely , the transfection of cortactin S405 , 418A reduced degradation of the ECM by 70 % ( Fig . 6A ) . Next , we investigated whether the phosphorylation - mimicking cortactin S405 , 418D could overcome the inhibitory effect of U0126 . To this end , we plated A375MM cells expressing cortactin S405 , 418D directly on fluorescent - gelatin - coated coverslips in the presence of BB94 . After adhesion and spreading , the cells were pretreated with 10 (cid:2) M U0126 for 15 minutes in the presence of BB94 . Next , BB94 was washed out and the cells incubated with UO126 for further 3 hours and finally fixed and stained . We found that expression of pseudophosphorylated cortactin S405 , 418D alone was not sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of UO126 ( data not shown ) , most probably because many other potential targets of ERK1 / 2 are involved in the regulation of the events upstream of cortactin . Finally , to exclude nonspecific effects of the mutant cortactin forms , we investigated the effects of the expression of both mutants after siRNA - mediated endogenous cortactin knockdown ( Fig . 4B , C ) . The re - expression of cortactin S405 , 418D on a cortactin - depleted background induced formation of invadopodia ( Fig . 6B ) and led to an obvious increase of ECM degradation compared with levels observed using cortactin WT ( not shown ) . Cortactin S405 , 418A transfection did not rescue the invasive phenotype ( not shown ) . These results suggest that cortactin phosphorylation on residues Ser405 and Ser418 ( presumably by ERK1 / 2 ) is a positive stimulus towards invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . Cortactin can also be phosphorylated in vitro by the p21 - activated serine / threonine kinase PAK ( Vidal et al . , 2002 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ) . Whether PAK itself plays a role in invadopodia biogenesis has not been investigated so far . To address this , we transfected A375MM cells with the autoinhibitory domain of PAK1 ( PAK - AID ) , known to inhibit the endogenous kinase ( Zhao et al . , 1998 ) . We found that PAK - AID expression induced a substantial decrease ( 50 - 70 % ) in ECM degradation ( Fig . 6C ) , suggesting that PAK activity supports invadopodia formation . The main PAK phosphorylation site on cortactin has been shown to be the Ser113 in the first actin - binding repeat ( Webb et al . , 2006 ) . This event is thought to negatively regulate cortactin binding to F - actin in vitro ( Webb et al . , 2006 ) . To test whether phosphorylation of cortactin on Ser113 has a regulatory role in invadopodia Fig . 5 . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for ECM degradation at invadopodia . ( A ) A375MM cells transfected with cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F display a significantly reduced ability to degrade the ECM compared with control cells transfected with cortactin WT . By contrast , cells transfected with the pseudophosphorylated cortactin Y421D increased their capacity to degrade the matrix . Data represent the mean ± s . d . of three independent experiments . Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t - test : wild type vs Y421D and Y421 , 466 , 482F , P < 0 . 002 . ( B ) Representative images of A375MM cells transfected with cortactin Y421D 48 hours after cortactin depletion . Typically , cortactin Y421D localizes to invadopodia . Scale bar : 10 (cid:2) m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 374 biogenesis , A375MM cells were transfected with cortactin WT as a control , and two cortactin phosphorylation mutants : a nonphosphorylatable S113A substitution and the phosphorylation - mimicking S113D ( Fig . 3 ) . Expression of cortactin S113A reduced invadopodia formation and ECM degradation by 50 % in contrast to cortactin S113D , which instead produced a 1 . 6 - fold increase in ECM degradation at invadopodia ( Fig . 6D ) . Of note , cortactin S113D localized to invadopodia ( Fig . 6E ) . When coexpressed with PAK - AID , however , cortactin S113D failed to revert the inhibitory effect ( not shown ) , probably because many other potential targets of PAK are involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and adhesion ( Zhao and Manser , 2005 ) and could thus act upstream of cortactin . To gain confirmation , we transfected cells with cortactin S113A , cortactin S113D and cortactin WT after siRNA - mediated endogenous cortactin knockdown ( Fig . 4C ) . Expression of cortactin S113A on a cortactin - depleted background failed to recover the normal phenotype compared with cortactin WT ( not shown ) . The phosphorylation - mimicking mutant cortactin S113D , instead , induced formation of invadopodia ( Fig . 7C ) and increased levels of ECM degradation compared with cortactin WT . These results indicate that cortactin phosphorylation on Ser113 , presumably by PAK , positively modulates invadopodia formation / function . Discussion We present a molecular dissection of the functional domains of cortactin relevant for invadopodia formation and function . In addition , through the expression of cortactin forms mutated in the residues previously found to be phosphorylated in vitro , we suggest the involvement of different kinases in the control of the ECM degradation machinery through the regulation of cortactin phosphorylation . The overexpression of mutant or deleted forms of cortactin that are unable to bind the Arp2 / 3 complex , induces a substantial decrease in the ability of the cells to form invadopodia and hence degrade the ECM . In addition , the SH3 domain of cortactin , known to bind a number of relevant proteins such as N - WASP and dynamin 2 , is also essential for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . This is at variance with a recent report suggesting that the cortactin N - terminus is not required for invadopodia formation ( Webb et al . , 2007 ) . A possible explanation is that the study was based on constitutively active Src - expressing NIH 3T3 cells ( which normally do not form invadopodia ) . Our findings are based on a tumoral cell model that spontaneously forms invadopodia and altogether support the idea that cortactin is an active scaffold protein bringing together different components , each domain being necessary for the formation of invadopodia , the initial step of the invasive process . Invadopodia are hotspots of protein tyrosine phosphorylation , mostly due to SFK ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Mueller et al . , 1992 ) . Furthermore , a clear colocalization between Src , cortactin and phosphotyrosine has been observed in active invadopodia , and tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin was found to be associated to invadopodia - enriched membrane fractions ( Bowden et al . , 2006 ) . This suggests a potential role for SFK - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at invadopodia . Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of one or more of the cortactin tyrosine residues Tyr421 , Tyr466 and Tyr482 is necessary for invadopodia formation and function . This provides a functional framework to interpret the finding that overexpression of the same tyrosine phosphorylation - deficient cortactin mutant used in this study inhibited bone metastasis formation in an in vivo mouse model ( Li et al . , 2001 ) . The same cortactin tyrosine residues , however , have recently been shown to be targets of Abl / Arg kinase and their phosphorylation by the same kinase is relevant for PDGF - induced dorsal wave formation ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ) . Our finding that the Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 3 ) Fig . 6 . Serine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for ECM degradation at invadopodia . ( A ) A375MM cells transfected with cortactin S405 , 418D display a remarkably increased ability to degrade the ECM compared with control cells transfected with cortactin WT . By contrast , transfection of cortactin S405 , 418A markedly reduced ECM degradation . Data represent the mean ± s . d . of three independent experiments . Statistical significance evaluated by Student’s t - test : wild type vs S405 , 418D , P < 0 . 01 ; wild type vs S405 , 418A , P < 0 . 005 . ( B ) Representative image of A375MM cells transfected with cortactin S405 , 418D 48 hours after cortactin depletion . Typically cortactin S405 , 418D localizes to invadopodia . ( C ) A375MM cells transfected with the autoinhibitory domain of PAK ( AID ) display a reduced ability to degrade the matrix compared with mock - transfected cells . Data represent the mean ± s . d . of three independent experiments . Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t - test : control vs autoinhibitory domain of PAK P < 0 . 0001 . ( D ) A375MM cells were transfected with cortactin WT , nonphosphorylatable cortactin S113A and pseudophosphorylated cortactin S113D . The areas of degradation were then quantified . Data represent the mean ± s . d . of three independent experiments . Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t - test : wild type vs S113A and S113D , P < 0 . 004 . ( E ) Representative immunofluorescence image of A375MM cells transfected with cortactin S113D 48 hours after cortactin knockdown labeled with anti - FLAG antibodies . Cortactin S113D clearly localizes to ECM degradation patches at invadopodia . Scale bars : 10 (cid:2) m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 375 Cortactin regulates invadopodia biogenesis Abl / Arg - specific inhibitor STI - 571 does not affect invadopodia formation or function , would exclude this kinase from the regulatory circuit governing invadopodia formation . A less studied aspect is the functional consequence of cortactin phosphorylation on serine . We observed that cortactin S405 , 418A acted as a dominant negative when transiently transfected and was unable to rescue the defective phenotype in cortactin - knockdown cells . Strikingly , the phosphoserine - mimicking mutant cortactin S405 , 418D induced a more than twofold increase in invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . The same pseudophosphorylated cortactin S405 , 418D failed , however , to attenuate the inhibitory effect of the ERK1 / 2 inhibitor U0126 . This finding is not surprising because ERK1 / 2 has multiple targets and regulates numerous functions in the cell ( reviewed by Kolch , 2005 ) , which could act upstream or in concert with cortactin in invadopodia formation and function . Since cortactin residues Ser405 and Ser418 are known targets of ERK1 / 2 ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) , our findings altogether suggest that ERK1 / 2 might be acting on cortactin to promote invadopodia formation . Cortactin has also been shown in vitro to be a substrate of the p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) family of serine / threonine kinases ( Vidal et al . , 2002 ) , known effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1 ( reviewed by Bokoch , 2003 ) . The main residue targeted by PAK is Ser113 ( Webb et al . , 2006 ) . Our results show that pseudophosphorylated cortactin S113D substantially enhances invadopodia formation and ECM degradation , whereas the corresponding nonphosphorylatable cortactin S113A mutant acts in a dominant negative fashion . Co - expression of PAK - AID with pseudophosphorylated cortactin S113D , however , was not sufficient to bypass the block induced by the PAK autoinhibitory domain . As in the case of ERK1 / 2 , various PAK isoforms are required for the regulation of signaling pathways at multiple levels and hence possibly upstream of cortactin . Our experiments do suggest that PAK activity is involved in invadopodia formation and that cortactin might be one of its targets . How can we reconcile our findings with the existing knowledge and current framework for cortactin function ? Following N - WASP activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , F - actin nucleation of barbed ends might be involved in the formation of invadopodia by pushing forward the plasma membrane ( Baldassarre et al . , 2006 ; Pollard , 2003 ; Weaver et al . , 2003 ) . Cortactin is thought to stabilize the branching point of dendritic actin networks by its interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex via its N - terminal acidic domain and the mother filament by means of its actin - binding region ( Olazabal and Machesky , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Cortactin may therefore act as a molecular scaffold essential to trigger invadopodia formation by tethering the Arp2 / 3 complex and its activator N - WASP , via its NTA and SH3 domains . Indeed , unlike other Arp2 / 3 complex activators , cortactin remains associated with the mother filament after binding and activation of Arp2 / 3 ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . Phosphorylation of cortactin by tyrosine ( possibly SFK ) or serine / threonine ( possibly PAK and ERK1 / 2 ) kinases , could directly or indirectly modulate the interaction and / or the binding of cortactin with its interacting partners . For instance , phosphorylation of cortactin on Ser113 ( presumably by PAK ) would stabilize branched actin networks but might also modulate its affinity for Arp2 / 3 because Ser113 is located adjacent to the N - terminal acidic domain ( Webb et al . , 2006 ) . Hence , in our experiments cortactin S113D could promote actin branching needed for invadopodia biogenesis . Based on in vitro experiments , it has been suggested , that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin stabilizes the intramolecular association of the SH3 domain with the PRD , whereas phosphorylation on Ser405 and Ser418 sets the SH3 domain free to bind and activate N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . We observe however that the nonphosphorylatable cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F acted in a dominant negative fashion , suggesting again that the regulation of cortactin is based on a dynamic interplay between the different regulatory inputs . Cortactin has also been shown to interact with a number of other proteins through its PRD and SH3 domains during the formation and / or disassembly of actin networks at invadopodia . Among these is dynamin 2 ( Krueger et al . , 2003 ; Schafer , 2002 ) , which is known to play a central role in invadopodia formation ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) . In this process , dynamin 2 could also affect the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex indirectly through cortactin ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ; Krueger et al . , 2003 ) . Of note , recent findings have shown that Src - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin enhances its affinity for dynamin - 2 more than threefold ( Zhu et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting a possible molecular basis for the stimulatory effect of cortactin phosphorylation by SFK in invadopodia formation . An interesting twist might be provided by a recent report suggesting that cortactin functions in regulating matrix metalloprotease secretion at invadopodia ( Clark et al . , 2007 ) . This would again bring dynamin 2 into the picture considering that cortactin has been reported to function in a complex with dynamin 2 in regulating anterograde membrane transport from the Golgi complex ( Cao et al . , 2005 ) . It is unclear whether cortactin phosphorylation by different kinases and on different residues takes place in a sequential and / or interdependent fashion . We performed a number of experiments in which the cortactin phosphorylation mutants described here were combined in double transfections in A375 cells . Specifically , nonphosphorylatable cortactin Y421 , 466 , 482F was cotransfected with pseudophosphorylated cortactin S113D , nonphosphorylatable cortactin S113A with pseudophosphorylated cortactin S405 , 418D and finally nonphosphorylatable cortactin S405 , 418A together with pseudophosphorylated cortactin S113D . We proceeded to assess ECM degradation as described above when comparable levels of cotransfection were achieved ( as determined by western blotting ; not shown ) . In all cases , the pseudophosphorylated cortactin mutants mimicking activity of one kinase class were able to overcome the effect of the nonphosphorylatable ones mimicking lack of activity of another class , leading to an increase in ECM degradation compared with cortactin WT ( supplementary material Fig . S2 ) . These results support the hypothesis of independent but convergent signaling pathways regulating phosphorylation of cortactin at invadopodia . These pathways might not be necessarily be all activated depending on the engagement of different integrins or other membrane receptors by ECM components . In summary , we show that at least three convergent routes may function to regulate cortactin activity by phosphorylation , but do not imply that these must act at the same time or in a sequential manner . Rather , a fine regulatory balance might exist through which cortactin controls invadopodia biogenesis , possibly acting as a trait d’union between signal generation at the plasma membrane triggered by integrin engagement and transduction to the appropriate cell machinery via tyrosine and serine / threonine kinases . In our interpretive model , the extent and quality of cortactin phosphorylation would be modulated by adhesion to matrix components via integrins and other membrane receptors . This would induce subtle changes in cortactin structure to calibrate its function . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 376 More facets of the complex cortactin regulatory pattern by phosphorylation will perhaps emerge . For instance , protein kinase D has recently been found to colocalize with F - actin , cortactin and Arp3 at the leading edge of migrating cells and to phosphorylate cortactin in vitro ( Eiseler et al . , 2007 ) . Also , mass spectrometry mapping has recently uncovered 17 new phosphorylated residues in cortactin ( 12 serine , 4 threonine and 1 tyrosine residues ) , and the same study also confirmed some of the known phosphorylation sites ( S405 , 418 and Y421 , 466 , 482 ) thus validating the approach ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . These modifications might be functionally relevant as they map to well - conserved residues in functional domains . All the above would suggest that the complex regulatory pattern of cortactin and in particular its significance for invadopodia biology , is just beginning to be understood .

Alexa Fluor 633 - , 546 - and 488 - conjugated secondary antibodies or phalloidin were from Molecular Probes Europe BV ( Leiden , The Netherlands ) . Aliquots of 1 mM BB94 ( British Biotech , UK ) were prepared in 70 % ethanol and kept at – 20°C until use at 5 (cid:2) M . Cell culture Human melanoma A375MM cells were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 ( 1 : 1 ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % FCS . Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 as previously described ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) . Immunofluorescence analysis of invadopodia At the light microscopy level , invadopodia are identified by the colocalization of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins , actin , cortactin and dynamin 2 at dark , nonfluorescent areas of degradation ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 2006 ; Chen , 1996 ; Mueller et al . , 1992 ) as shown in Fig . 1A . To this end , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes , permeabilized for 30 minutes in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 02 % saponin , 0 . 2 % BSA and 50 mM NH 4 Cl , incubated with the primary antibodies of interest or fluorophore - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) for 1 hour and then , where necessary , incubated with fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 minutes . Finally , coverslips were mounted in Mowiol ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) . Experiments were observed using an Olympus videomicroscope equipped with T . I . L . L . Photonics software ( T . I . L . L . Photonics GmbH , Gräfelfing , Germany ) . ECM degradation assay Fluorophore - conjugated gelatin was prepared with Fluorescein or Rhodamine B isothiocyanate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and porcine gelatine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the published procedure ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 2001 ) . Gelatin - coated coverslips were prepared and the assay carried out as described previously ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ; Bowden et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , thin layers of Fluorescein - or Rhodamine B - conjugated gelatin ( or unconjugated gelatin where specified ) were placed on coverslips , crosslinked with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 15 minutes at 0°C , washed three times with PBS and incubated for 3 minutes at room temperature with 5 mg / ml NaBH 4 . Finally , after a wash and 10 - minute incubation in 70 % ethanol , coverslips were washed with complete medium for 1 hour at 37°C before cell plating . To quantify areas of degradation , for each experiment we considered 35 random fields containing at least one transfected cell ; the area of each degradation patch was measured using the public domain ImageJ v . 1 . 32 software . The total area was then normalized for the number of cells and the effect of each treatment was expressed as a percentage of control . When gelatin is referred to ( whether fluorophore - conjugated or not ) , it is to be intended crosslinked as described above . Invadopodia synchronization A375MM cells were plated directly on fluorophore - conjugated or unconjugated gelatin in the presence of 5 (cid:2) M BB94 to block invadopodia formation and incubated up to 96 hours , depending on the experiment . BB94 was then washed out to allow synchronous invadopodia formation . Transfection Cells were plated at 50 % confluence in six - well plates and allowed to adhere and spread . The next day , monolayers were washed twice with DMEM / F - 12 without FCS and incubated in 0 . 5 ml DMEM / F - 12 without FCS with 2 - 4 (cid:2) g DNA and TransFast reagent ( Promega , Madison , WI ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Experiments were performed 24 hours after transfection . Cortactin RNA interference and phenotype recovery A375MM cells were plated directly on fluorophore - conjugated gelatin in the presence of BB94 to block invadopodia formation and were allowed to adhere overnight . Next , cells were transfected with the siGenome Smart pool reagent for human cortactin ( code M010508 - 00 - 0005 Dharmacon , Lafayette , CA ) using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Mock and nontargeting siRNA ( code D - 001206 , Dharmacon ) transfections were performed as controls . After 72 hours , BB94 was washed out and the cells incubated for further 3 hours to allow the formation of invadopodia and degradation of the ECM . To assay for endogenous cortactin content after RNA interference , cells were lysed with RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS ) containing 2 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin , 2 (cid:2) M pepstatin , 0 . 5 mM O - phenantroline , 1 mM PMSF and 1 (cid:2) M benzamidine for 20 minutes on ice . Proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE , electroblotted to nitrocellulose and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Milano , Italy ) with anti - cortactin and anti - GAPDH antibodies . Densitometric analysis of protein bands was performed with Image J 1 . 32 . In some experiments , to evaluate the effect of cortactin mutant expression after cortactin depletion , cells were re - transfected 48 hours later with the various wild - type or mutant cortactin constructs . After a 24 - hour incubation to allow for expression , BB94 was washed out and cells quantified for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation after a further 3 - hour period . Analysis of protein kinase inhibitor effects A375MM cells were plated directly on fluorophore - conjugated gelatin in the presence of 5 (cid:2) M BB94 and incubated for 16 hours . The following day , cells were preincubated with 10 (cid:2) M U0126 ( mitogen - activated protein / ERK kinase inhibitor ; Promega ) , 5 (cid:2) M SU6656 ( Src - family kinase inhibitor ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , 20 (cid:2) M STI571 ( Abl / Arg kinase inhibitor ; kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG ) or vehicle for 15 minutes ( UO126 ) or 30 minutes ( SU6656 and STI571 ) . BB94 was washed out and cells were treated with 10 (cid:2) M U0126 , 5 (cid:2) M SU6656 , 20 (cid:2) M STI571 or vehicle for further 3 hours . Finally , cells were processed for invadopodia visualization and quantification of ECM degradation . To verify the effectiveness of inhibitor treatments , cells were lysed with 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM NaF , 40 mM (cid:6) - glycerophosphate , 200 (cid:2) M sodium orthovanadate , 1 % Triton X - 100 with 2 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin , 2 (cid:2) M pepstatin , 0 . 5 mM O - phenantroline , 1 mM PMSF and 1 (cid:2) M benzamidine for 20 minutes on ice .
