Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to suffering psychological effects as result of such measures . In Spain , children were enforced to a strict home lockdown for 42 days during the ﬁrst wave . Here , we studied the effects of lockdown in children and adolescents through an online questionnaire . Methods : A cross - sectional study was conducted in Spain using an open online survey from July ( after the lockdown resulting from the ﬁrst pandemic wave ) to November 2020 ( second wave ) . We included families with children under 16 years - old living in Spain . Parents answered a survey regarding the lockdown effects on their children and were instructed to invite their children from 7 to 16 years - old ( mandatory scholar age in Spain ) to respond a speciﬁc set of questions . Answers were collected through an application programming interface system , and data analysis was performed using R . Results : We included 1 , 957 families who completed the questionnaires , covering a total of 3 , 347 children . The speciﬁc children’s questionnaire was completed by 167 kids ( 7 – 11 years - old ) , and 100 adolescents ( 12 – 16 years - old ) . Children , in general , showed high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations . Sleeping problems were reported in more than half of the children ( 54 % ) and adolescents ( 59 % ) , and these were strongly associated with less time doing sports and spending more than 5 h per day using electronic devices . Parents perceived their children to Ajanovic et al . Lockdown and Child Well - Being gain weight ( 41 % ) , be more irritable and anxious ( 63 % ) and sadder ( 46 % ) . Parents and children differed signiﬁcantly when evaluating children’s sleeping disturbances . Conclusions : Enforced lockdown measures and isolation can have a negative impact on children and adolescent’s mental health and well - being . In future waves of the current pandemic , or in the light of potential epidemics of new emerging infections , lockdown measures targeting children , and adolescents should be reconsidered taking into account their infectiousness potential and their age - speciﬁc needs , especially to facilitate physical activity and to limit time spent on electronic devices . Keywords : COVID - 19 , lockdown , children , adolescent , mental health , well - being BACKGROUND Nearly 80 – 90 % of school - age youth could not physically attend school in more than 160 countries during the ﬁrst wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic ( 1 , 2 ) . In Spain , one of the ﬁrst measures implemented when cases started increasing was to close all schools and impose a strict home conﬁnement . During the ﬁrst period of the lockdown ( March 14th – April 27th of 2020 ) , referred as “strict lockdown” hereinafter , only essential activities were allowed , and children were compelled to stay home except for emergency situations . From April 28th to June 21st , children were progressively allowed to leave the household in a very controlled manner and for a limited period ( i . e . , 1 h per day with no close interactions ) , during what became referred as the “relaxed lockdown . ” Schools remained closed and pupils attended online lectures whenever possible . Children did not return to face - to - face learning until September 2020 . Home conﬁnement measures due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , which were particularly stringent for children , may have had deleterious eﬀects on the physical and mental health of this particularly vulnerable age group ( 3 , 4 ) . Herein , we aimed to understand the perceived impact of lockdown measures on the mental health and well - being of minors , as reported by parents , but also adolescents and children themselves . We focused on risk perception and attitudes toward lockdown , perceptions of schooling , emotional responses , changes in biorhythms , psychical activity , sleep and eating attitudes , and screen time . METHODS Study Design We performed a cross - sectional study using convenience sampling through an online survey , launched in July 2020 and available until November 2020 . The study was promoted via social media and the landing page of the Kids Corona Project . The questionnaire ( see Supplementary Material ) was created by a team of pediatricians at Hospital Sant Joan de Déu of Barcelona , Spain , and was available in Spanish or Catalan ( the two oﬃcial languages in Catalonia ) . Questions speciﬁcally referred to the strict lockdown but also enquired about feelings / perceptions Abbreviations : CA , Children answering ; COVID - 19 , Coronavirus disease 2019 ; IQR , Interquartile range ; PA , Parents answering ; SARS - CoV - 2 , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . at the moment of survey completion ( which was after the lockdown ) . To avoid collecting disturbances present before lockdown , we asked about “new problems detected during lockdown . ” Most questions had yes / no as possible answers , but some asked respondents to choose between few closed answers or grade a perception on a scale from 0 ( minimum ) to 10 ( maximum ) . Families living in Spain with children under 16 years of age were invited to participate and to answer questions regarding COVID - 19 and the physical , mental health and wellbeing of children during lockdown . Parents answered the survey regarding their children ( 0 – 16 years ) . Those children old enough to read and answer the questionnaire themselves , and who were in the age group for which there is mandatory schooling ( > 6 – < 16 years of age ) , were invited to answer the survey . Children aged 7 – 11 years were instructed to do it with caregivers’ support , and adolescents over 11 years old were instructed to do it on their own . Data Collection The answers to these surveys were collected through an API system using a custom code written in Python ( 5 ) . Selection criteria for household enrollment were ( i ) accepted informed consent , ( ii ) respondent aged 18 years old or more , ( iii ) one or more children under 16 years old , and ( iv ) declared a valid Spanish postal code . Additionally , children and adolescents’ answers were considered if both parents and the participating minor provided assent . Statistical Analysis The analysis was performed using R language ( 6 ) . The signiﬁcance level for the statistical tests was α = 0 . 05 ; Bonferroni correction was applied when using multiple tests . Chi - squared test was applied to tabulated counts of categorical data ( p - values are estimated using Monte Carlo method in the case of small cell counts ) . Mann – Whitney test is applied to numerical answers ; the reported p - value results from the corresponding one - sided test . Ethical Considerations The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and the Declaration of Helsinki ( current version Fortaleza , Brazil , October 2013 ) , and following the relevant legal requirements ( Law 14 / 2007 of July 3 , 2007 , on Biomedical Research ) . The study protocol , informed consent forms and data collection tools were approved by the Ethics Committee for clinical research of the Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 2 November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 746052 Ajanovic et al .

RESULTS Demographics A total of 2 , 054 families answered the survey , of which 1 , 957 met the study inclusion criteria . The included surveys covered a total of 3 , 347 children : 1 , 463 aged 0 – 6 years , 1 , 284 aged 7 – 11 years , and 600 adolescents aged 12 – 15 years . All parents answered a questionnaire , one for each daughter or son , independently . Additionally , 13 % of the older children ( 167 answers ) and 17 % of the adolescents ( 100 answers ) completed the questionnaire speciﬁcally addressed to their respective age group . In 57 % of the households there was at least 1 adult working in a highly COVID - 19 exposed environment ( e . g . , health centers , hospitals , or old people’s retirement homes ) . The main participants sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Risk Perception and Transmission Knowledge At the time of survey completion , 6 % of the households reported at least one family member having been aﬀected or currently infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) ( microbiologically conﬁrmed infection ) , and 12 % reported at least one suspected case . The majority ( 84 % ) of families knew someone infected and 20 % knew someone close who had died of COVID - 19 . Among families with either a suspected or microbiologically conﬁrmed infection , 47 % considered a 5 – 15 year - old child to have been the index case , 22 % a 0 – 4 year - old , 12 % a > 16 year - old , and 19 % reported a simultaneous infection among more than one household member ( of varying ages ) . Median time to subsequent secondary cases was 6 . 5 days ( interquartile range [ IQR ] : 3 – 10 ) . When a case was conﬁrmed or suspected at home , measures adopted varied widely between families : 42 % followed a strict lockdown of the family , 21 % a strict lockdown of the aﬀected person , 16 % used a facemask at home , 19 % ensured an exclusive use of the sleeping room and bathroom , 19 % restricted the use of common spaces , and 39 % did not follow any of the aforementioned measures . Regarding parents’ opinion about children’s role in the pandemic , 42 % perceived them to be at high risk of getting infected by SARS - CoV - 2 , 50 % thought strict lockdown measures for children were necessary , 60 % considered that children should have had permission to go outside in a controlled way since the ﬁrst day , and 65 % found re - opening of schools was appropriate ( 98 % of them suggested to do it with safety measures in place ) . During strict lockdown , 88 % of children never set foot on the street , while during relaxed lockdown the majority ( 54 % ) spent time outdoors at least 3 – 6 days a week for < 1 h / day . Masks were worn by 95 % of older children and adolescents and by almost half of the children below 6 years of age , even if this was not mandatory in Spain . Coping With Conﬁnement The overall rate of good coping with conﬁnement ( rated on a 0 – 10 scale ) was generally very positive . Parents scored their children an 8 [ IQR : 6 – 9 ] both during strict and relaxed TABLE 1 | Characteristics of the 1 , 957 families included in the study .

When asking if they would Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 3 November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 746052 Ajanovic et al . Lockdown and Child Well - Being FIGURE 1 | Overall coping with strict and relaxed lockdown according to parents and to children and adolescents . accept another strict lockdown if necessary due to a hypothetical worsening of the pandemic , 73 % of parents , 81 % of older children , and 83 % of adolescents would accept it . Of note , we found no diﬀerences in these answers between children living with a conﬁrmed / suspected case of SARS - CoV - 2 and those living without it . One in every ﬁve families had an episode of a child needing healthcare attention during strict lockdown ( 58 % febrile episodes , 4 % acute mental health problems ) . Biorhythms ( Physical Activity , Alimentary Patterns , and Sleeping Disturbances ) According to parents’ perception , during strict lockdown 90 % of older children and 81 % of adolescents practiced less sports than usual ( Figure 2 ) , and 64 % of older children and 39 % adolescents did not do any kind of sports . On the other hand , during relaxed lockdown , 65 % of children and adolescents used the allowed time outdoors to do some kind of sport . When asking parents about weight and eating disturbances , 10 % perceived in their children to lose weight and 41 % to gain weight . Additionally , 17 % reported new eating problems not present before lockdown such as eating less , more and / or in diﬀerent periodicity than usual , being picky with food , and eating due to anxiety or boredom . Parents reported sleeping problems during the strict lockdown in 54 % of young children , 57 % of older children and 59 % of adolescents . The most common problem among all age groups was hard time falling asleep . Interestingly , when children and adolescents answered , they reported more sleeping disturbances than their parents ( p = 0 . 000004 and p = 0 . 009 ) . In older children , higher self - perception was observed for awakening in the middle of the night ( Parents Answering [ PA ] : 18 % , Children Answering [ CA ] : 33 % ) , sleeping more than usual ( PA : 14 % , CA : 32 % ) , having a hard time falling asleep ( PA : 40 % , CA : 48 % ) , and having nightmares ( PA : 12 % , CA : 28 % ) . Similarly , increased self - perception in adolescents was observed for awakening in the middle of the night ( PA : 6 % , CA : 22 % ) , sleeping more than usual ( PA : 21 % , CA : 35 % ) , having a hard time falling asleep ( PA : 34 % , CA : 46 % ) , and having nightmares ( PA : 4 % , CA : 11 % ; Figure 3 ) . Emotional Distress When we asked parents about emotional distress signs observed in their children , 63 % reported to have witnessed them to be more anxious than usual , 63 % to be more irritable , 46 % to be sadder , and 34 % to have other emotional alterations . More than half of older children reported themselves to be more anxious ( 62 % ) , irritable ( 55 % ) , and sadder ( 52 % ) , with median intensities from 4 to 5 out of 10 during strict lockdown . In adolescents , these feelings were reported in 49 , 46 , and 41 % individuals , respectively , with median intensities from 3 to 5 out of 10 during strict lockdown . Electronic Devices and Social Media Parents reported that at least one type of electronic device ( i . e . , smartphone , television or online audiovisual content , videogames , or social media ) was used more than usual during strict lockdown in 77 % of younger children , 93 % of older children , and 95 % of adolescents . The most widely used device was television together with online audiovisual content , with 75 % of younger children , 85 % of older children , and 82 % of adolescents using it more often than before the lockdown . Playing videogames also increased in 65 % of older children and 62 % of adolescents . In addition , adolescents also increased use of their smartphone ( 68 % ) and social media ( 61 % ) . The use time of electronic devices increased with age , being 1 – 3 h / day the predominant option among all children and 3 – 5 h / day the predominant option among adolescents . Higher use of social media increased during lockdown in comparison with the usual utilization before lockdown , and was self - reported by 28 % of older children and 52 % of adolescents .

Lockdown and Child Well - Being FIGURE 2 | Time spent doing sports according to parents and to children and adolescents . According to parents’ perception , during strict lockdown 90 % of older children and 81 % of adolescents practiced less sports than usual , similarly as children themselves reported when asked . FIGURE 3 | Sleeping problems during lockdown according to parents and to children and adolescents . Schooling Parents scored satisfaction with remote schooling in a 0 – 10 scale , with a median of 6 [ IQR : 4 – 9 ] for younger children , and with a median of 7 [ IQR : 5 – 8 ] for older children . Children themselves scored it with a median of 7 [ IQR : 5 – 8 ] . The most common score was 10 among the three groups . Both parents of adolescents and teenagers themselves scored schooling satisfaction with a median of 7 [ IQR : 5 – 9 ] , but in this group the mode score was 10 for parents and 8 for the students . When children were asked if they were satisﬁed with school activities , 26 % of children and 35 % of adolescents were not . Importantly , 81 % of children reported to feel comfortable with schools re - opening compared to a 65 % of adolescents , and 52 % of the latter thought it was necessary . Comparisons and Inference In all age groups , we found higher number of reported sleeping problems ( either by parents or by children ) among those knowing someone who died of COVID - 19 compared to those Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 5 November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 746052 Ajanovic et al .

Older children who reported to have felt fear or anxiety about going out reported a higher incidence of sleeping disturbances than the ones who did not feel that way ( 56 vs . 39 . 3 % , p = 0 . 047 ) . In general , sleeping problems were less likely to happen among children who did sport during lockdown vs . the ones who did not ( 49 . 15 vs . 41 . 67 % ) , especially regarding having trouble falling asleep and sleeping more than usual . Doing sport activities as usual seems to be mildly protective against sleeping problems when compared to spending less time than usual ( p = 0 . 04 ) . Spending more than 5 h per day looking at screens was a risk factor for some of the sleeping disturbances in teenagers , when compared to 1 – 3 h of daily use ( p = 0 . 00087 ) . Regarding the reported feelings by children and adolescents , the score on irritability was signiﬁcantly lower among kids ( 5 [ IQR : 2 – 7 ] vs . 6 [ IQR : 3 – 8 ] , p = 0 . 0062 ) and adolescents ( 4 [ IQR : 1 – 6 ] vs . 6 [ IQR : 3 – 7 ] , p = 0 . 015 ) who did sport as compared to those who did not . In addition , less physical activity than usual was also found to be associated with an increased feeling of sadness in adolescents , as compared to spending more time than usual doing sport ( p = 0 . 01 ) . The increased use of social networks above usual levels was found to be associated with increased anxiety levels in teenager reported answers ( p = 0 . 0077 ) . Among adolescents , being unsatisﬁed with academic training during lockdown was found to be associated with anxiety ( p = 0 . 04 ) , and fear of going out in the street was associated with increased perceived sadness ( p = 0 . 00017 ) . DISCUSSION Here , we described how COVID - 19 lockdown has aﬀected children and adolescents’ well - being using a set of online questionnaires targeting families in Catalonia and Spain , which reported the status of 3 , 347 children . We found that , at the onset of the pandemic , parental perception of children’s risk of infection and transmission were generally high , probably supported by the containment measures applied in many countries , which included schools’ closure . In other studies , the greatest risk perception has been found in women with lower education who have children in their care ( 7 ) . However , recent research suggests that children are less ( 8 ) or Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 6 November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 746052 Ajanovic et al . Lockdown and Child Well - Being equally ( 9 ) likely to become infected than adults when exposed to a case and , when infected , children’s symptoms are usually milder ( 9 , 10 ) . Interestingly , despite the high - risk initial perception , the majority of parents would have preferred their children to be allowed to spend time outdoors during the entire lockdown period and strongly supported the re - opening of schools with prevention measures in place . It has been recently demonstrated that children’s role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is likely to be weaker than for other age groups during school re - opening due to the prevention tools adopted and children compliance with them ( 11 ) . Parents reported children to cope with conﬁnement reasonably well , according to a previous study where parents reported a more engagement than disengagement - oriented coping strategy in Spanish children during lockdown ( 12 ) . Parents , but especially children and adolescents , reported to cope better during the relaxed lockdown compared to the strict lockdown . The change in lockdown measures was positively rated and the allowed time outdoors was mostly used for sports activities . Actually , it has been shown that children missed outdoor exercise during strict lockdown ( 13 ) , and that having an outdoor exit in the house ( e . g . , garden , terrace ) contributed to lower levels of psychological and behavioral symptomatology ( 14 ) . Indeed , we showed physical and sports activities were highly decreased during lockdown in most children and adolescents as previously reported ( 13 – 16 ) , and 39 % of children and adolescent did not do sport at all . In addition , 41 % of parents reported their children to have suﬀered weight increases , probably as a result of the reduced physical activity and the reduction of fruit and vegetable consumption ( 15 ) . We found sleeping disturbances during lockdown were reported for the majority of children and adolescents , in accordance with previous studies ( 14 – 17 ) . Importantly , we observed that children and adolescents self - reported more sleeping disturbances than what was reported by their parents . Given many of these disturbances are probably not easily observed by caregivers ( i . e . , nightmares , awakening in the night ) unless children are directly asked , interviewing children and adolescents about their well - being should be included in this type of studies , and children’s participation in surveys should be further promoted . Despite clear instructions to parents to encourage their children and adolescents to respond a questionnaire , we obtained low participation of children and adolescents in our survey . Eventhough , we still reached a total of 267 , allowing making valuable conclusions about their self - reported well - being . On the other hand , knowing someone who died from COVID - 19 was associated with sleeping disturbances , as well as the statement “being afraid or anxious about going outside . ” Accordingly , it has been shown that children who knew someone who had suﬀered from COVID - 19 at home or whose parent was directly involved in the pandemic , presented higher anxiety scores ( 18 ) . Of note , anxiety and irritability were reported for the majority of children and adolescents , being the youngest the most aﬀected . Similar results have been recently described ( 14 , 17 , 19 , 20 ) and underline the need to consider how we communicate information to children and help them manage this information . Furthermore , it has been shown that anxiety and depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes were more likely in children whose parents reported higher levels of stress , depression or were unemployed ( 18 , 20 – 23 ) , and that those were often more important among the youngest ones ( 20 ) . Thus , supporting parents’ mental health and providing them with accurate information , strategies and support to cope with lockdown is essential to protect their children’s mental health ( 24 , 25 ) . We also found that sleeping disturbances were associated with doing less sports than usual , which supports allowing outdoor activity and sports during lockdown periods to protect children’s mental health and well - being . Actually , it has been shown a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent sleeping time between strict and relaxed conﬁnement ( 15 ) . Of note , children who could go outside during COVID - 19 restrictions , as well as children whose parents were less stressed , were more likely to meet the physical activity suggested by WHO guidelines ( 24 ) , which in turn resulted in reduced psychosocial diﬃculties ( 16 ) . The increase in anxiety , irritability , sadness and changes in biorhythms are adaptive symptoms to stressful situations , and although the expectation is that they will slowly improve when the pandemic restrictions are eased , it is possible that a number of these children and adolescents develop a more serious mental health problem . In accordance with recent studies , we also found a dramatic increase in electronic devices’ usage in all age groups ( 14 , 15 , 23 , 26 ) , which has been shown to pose a risk on mental health regardless of the pandemic . The use of Internet has undoubtedly facilitated to some extent the continuity of social and schooling activity during lockdown , especially during strict lockdown . However , deprivation of sports and outdoors activities in favor of screen time consumption might be a damaging trade - oﬀ . We found an association between spending more time in electronic devices ( > 5 h per day ) and sleeping disturbances , as well as with reported irritability , sadness and anxiety . In line with our ﬁndings , frequent social media exposure has been shown to be positively associated with anxiety ( 26 ) . Interestingly , lower screen exposure was observed for the relaxed lockdown period ( 15 ) . Interestingly , and despite having endured the strictest lockdown , most children and adolescents reported acceptance to go back to a strict lockdown if this was required due to the epidemiological situation , reﬂecting their high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations . The reported acceptance of prevention measures was very high , and even though the use of facemask was not among the most popular measures according to parents , older children and adolescents reported to wear it when spending time outdoors . Of note , the use of facemask is not mandatory in Spain under 6 years of age ; however , its use was reported for half of this young children’s age group . Despite the possible social desirability bias , the use of facemasks is certainly extended among children . Indeed , a recent study in Spain found that risk perception and age groups with the highest self - perceived risk of disease ( 51 – 64 years of age ) were also those who went most often outside their homes ( 27 , 28 ) . This diﬀers markedly from our results among children , who scrupulously followed the rules and would do so again . Furthermore , children Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 7 November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 746052 Ajanovic et al . Lockdown and Child Well - Being whose parents were more resilient and adopted prevention and safety measures presented fewer negative responses during lockdown ( 12 ) , pointing to the impact of adults adhering to prevention measures not only in terms of viral spread , but also in children’s safety perception and emotional well - being . A major strength of our study is the large number of families who answered the survey , largely superior to previous studies carried out in Spain and capturing information about 3 , 347 children . Another major strength is the collection of questionnaires directly from children and adolescents , which is not often included in similar studies . On the other hand , since our study is based on questionnaires answered by parents and their children after the lockdown periods studied , it could be aﬀected by a recall bias and social desirability bias . However , the surveys performed to Spanish children and adolescents during the strict lockdown showed similar emotional and behavioral alterations ( 21 , 24 , 29 ) . Another limitation is the timespan during which the questionnaires could be completed , which included few months and the beginning of the second COVID - 19 wave in Spain , something that could have aﬀected the responses . On the other hand , using online surveys based on volunteer participation probably resulted in a biased population , where underrepresentation of families with less - resources ( which might lack a smartphone or computer , and / or lack access to the internet ) is certainly present . This could have inﬂuenced the answers obtained , such as satisfaction with remote schooling , which was relatively good in our study . In addition , since our online survey did not include sensitive personal data , we could not exclude data from repetition of study participants . However , families were asked to answer the survey only once and data analysis suggests these instructions have been generally followed , given we found no repetition of descriptive family data among participants . Finally , since this is a cross - sectional study , we cannot infer cause - eﬀect relationships . However , our associations could be further explored in future studies to determine if a cause - eﬀect relationship exists . Although longitudinal assessments of the lockdown eﬀects in children are needed , our results point out the importance of considering mental health and well - being protection during lockdown measures implementation to control COVID - 19 outbreaks . In summary , our study showed a negative impact of strict lockdown in the mental health and well - being of children and adolescents but also showed their high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations . Lockdown measures should consider their age - speciﬁc needs in future waves of the pandemic and in similar potential emergencies , facilitating physical activity and limiting time spent on electronic devices . Maintaining schools open or , at least , ensuring children can spend a minimum time outdoors , can help address these priorities .
