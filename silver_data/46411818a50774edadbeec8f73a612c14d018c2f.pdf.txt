Health and Quality of Life Outcomes Predictors of fear control related to COVID - 19 among older population : an investigation on COVID - 19 risk perception and health related quality of life during the pandemic Saeedeh Avazzadeh 1 , Neda Gilani 2 and Leila Jahangiry 1 , 3 * Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the role of demographic characteristics , general health and health related quality of life on the fear control . Also , the aim of study was to explore how older people percept the COVID - 19 pandemic by using the component of the expanded parallel process model ( EPPM ) , and how the possible percep - tion may contribute to probable behavior responses to prevention and control of COVID - 19 . Methods The present study is a cross - sectional study that was conducted in Tabriz , a city in north of Iran from Febru - ary to April 2021 , the period that correspond with the fourth wave of COVID - 19 . To collect information , the Covid - 19 risk perception questionnaire ( based on EPPM model including efficacy , defensive responses , and perceived threat ) and health related quality of life ( HQOL ) Short Form - 36 questionnaire were used . Discriminate value was calculated to estimate fear control and danger control . Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were calculated to exam - ine the effect of demographic characteristics , general health and health - related quality of life on the fear control . Results The mean age of the 350 participants was 67 . 9 ( 6 . 4 ) years . A total of 83 . 1 % of participants were engaged in danger control processes and 16 . 9 % in fear control processes . According to the multivariable results , significant pre - dictors for fear control were : gender 1 . 57 ( 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 2 . 34 , 0 . 025 ) , education 7 . 38 ( 1 . 42 – 38 . 35 , p = 0 . 017 ) , economic status 1 . 31 ( 0 . 4 – 0 . 63 , p = 0 . 029 ) , and significant protective factors for fear control were : body pain 0 . 97 ( 0 . 94 – 0 . 99 , p = 0 . 041 ) , general health 0 . 96 ( 0 . 93 – 0 . 98 , p = 0 . 032 ) , physical health 0 . 94 ( 0 . 90 – 0 . 98 ) and total quality of life 0 . 024 ( 0 . 89 – 0 . 98 ) . Conclusions Strong associations of fear control were found with being female , being illiterate , and having a good economic status and also body pain , general health , physical health and total HQOL were significantly associated with danger control . Since , most of elderly populations have adequately higher perceptions of efficacy to counteract their threat perceptions to continue motivating these older people to engage in COVID - 19 self - protective behaviors , it is necessary to emphasis on the susceptibility of target population and the severity of the COVID - 19 threats .

Health and Quality of Life Outcomes ( 2023 ) 21 : 79 Background The coronavirus pandemic ( COVID - 19 ) has initiated as a major global health challenge . Efforts to identify the first case of a COVID - 19 infection was reported in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 [ 1 ] . The COVID - 19 disease has had a huge impact on individuals all around the world especially on older individuals . Such significant changes are necessarily followed by anxieties caused from variety aspects of life [ 2 ] . The most notable of which are health and financial instability . The COVID - 19 raises the risk of mortality and significant problems as people become older . The rise in death rates in persons with pre - existing medical problems ( severe chronic diseases , such as heart disease ) was an additional factor burdening the senior population [ 3 ] . The ongoing global pandemic of COVID - 19 has been further complicated by the emergence of new strains of the virus . These new strains , such as the Alpha , Beta , Gamma , and Delta variants , have been identified in vari - ous parts of the world , contributing to increased trans - missibility and potential challenges in public health response efforts . These strains are believed to have dif - ferent characteristics , including higher infectivity rates or potential resistance to certain treatments or vaccines . As a result , they have led to increased concern among health authorities and governments , necessitating the imple - mentation of stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus [ 4 , 5 ] . Elderly people make up on average 16 percent of the population in industrialized countries and this number is expected to rise to 19 percent in the next decades [ 6 ] . Iran is experiencing a rapid transition towards becom - ing an aging society , with one of the fastest growth rates of older population globally . According to avail - able data , the proportion of elderly individuals in Iran surged from 7 . 22 % in 2006 to 20 . 8 % in 2011 , indicating a significant increase in just five years . It is projected that this trend will continue , and by 2050 , the elderly popula - tion is expected to reach 21 . 7 % [ 7 , 8 ] . This demographic shift poses various challenges for the country , including healthcare , pension systems , and social support . Accord - ing to data from the Oxford COVID - 19 Evidence Service , persons in their 60s have a mortality risk of 3 . 6 percent which rises to 8 . 0 and 14 . 8 percent in their 70s and 80s , respectively [ 9 ] . Approximately 80 % of COVID - 19 - re - lated deaths have occurred in adults over the age of 60 . According to US reports , ten to twenty - seven percent of persons over the age of 85 are in the risk of death because of COVID - 19 [ 10 , 11 ] . Risk perception as a common psychological reaction is a subjective assessment of the likelihood of bad events made by an individual [ 12 ] . It is affected by cognitive , emotional , social , and cultural variables [ 13 ] . Risk perception related to COVID - 19 among older individual are reflected in the insecurities and impact adversely on the quality of life of older persons who believe COVID - 19 poses a significant risk to their health or financial status [ 14 ] . In general , aging might increase one’s susceptibility to certain diseases and lead to impair - ment in later years [ 15 , 16 ] . Given the increased vulner - ability of older persons to the COVID - 19 and detrimental impacts of aging on one’s capacity , their dependence will raise the need for help during COVID - 19 pandemic . World Health Organization ( WHO ) announced that every country should develop and implement compre - hensive public health measures to combat the spread of COVID - 19 [ 17 ] . Available findings show that temporary mobility restrictions , social distance , and large - scale gathering ban , in combination of wearing mask and cleaning hands help reduce the spread of COVID - 19 , but they also have negative consequences in many aspects of individual’s life [ 18 ] . Older persons are experiencing a generational divide on how they encourage to separate themselves from other people and self - isolate to stop the spread of COVID - 19 [ 19 ] . The likely increase in the incidence of serious health complications from covid - 19 among older adults , especially those with comorbid conditions , has exacerbated their physical and social isolation , and led to increase in the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression among this population group [ 20 ] . Social iso - lation increase the risk of depression in older people [ 21 ] . Strong evidences show that several factors may affect COVID - 19 related behaviors [ 22 – 24 ] . According to health education the - ories , risk perception is one of key factors that influence health behaviors because an individual perceived threat to prevent dis - ease [ 25 ] . Of these , the expanded parallel process model ( EPPM ) is a relevant theory that explains how fear messages persuade people into healthy behavior and determine that under which circumstances fear messages succeed or fail [ 26 ] . Many investi - gations have found a link between fear emotions and heightened risk perception with frightened people seeing a higher chance of bad outcomes after being exposed to fear - related stimuli . This link has been discovered in a variety of people , including those who are afraid of snakes and spiders [ 27 – 29 ] , those who are afraid of contamination [ 30 ] , and those who are socially nervous [ 31 ] . The aim of this study was to examine the role of demo - graphic characteristics , general health and health related quality of life on the fear control . Also , the aim of study was to explore how older people percept the COVID - 19 pandemic by using the component of the EPPM model ( efficacy , defensive responses , perceived threat ) , and how the possible perception may contribute to prob - able behavior responses to prevention and control of COVID - 19 .

Health and Quality of Life Outcomes ( 2023 ) 21 : 79 Methods Study design and participants The present study is a cross - sectional study that was con - ducted in Tabriz , a city in north of Iran from February to April 2021 , the period that correspond with the fourth wave of COVID - 19 in Iran . The study recruited the elderly individuals over 60 years of age [ 32 ] . The inclu - sion criteria were : being mentally conscious and able to answer the study questions . Cluster sampling method was applied for sampling . Tabriz has sixteen health cent - ers that considered as the study clusters . The health records of older people were available in the health cent - ers . Four health centers were randomly selected from sixteen centers and then about 25 % of the blocks were selected from the selected centers . In the next stage , the phone number of older individuals were extracted from their health records and through phone interview they were asked to participate in the study . Then , eligible and interested participants were invited to the study through a telephone call interview by a trained researcher ( SA , MSc student in healthy aging ) . Measurements and scoring To collect information , the Covid - 19 risk perception questionnaire [ 23 ] , and HQOL Short Form - 36 question - naire were used . The Covid - 19 risk perception question - naire is a 29 items questionnaire contemplating three predefined dimensions including : self - efficacy , response efficacy , defensive responses ( avoidance , denial , and reac - tance ) , and threat perception ( susceptibility and severity ) . The perceived self - efficacy consisted of six items meas - uring participants’ beliefs about their ability to perform the recommended responses to the COVID - 19 . Response efficacy included seven items to assess participants’ opin - ion about the effectiveness of the recommended preven - tative responses to the COVID - 19 . Defensive response ( denial , reactance and avoidance ) included eight items to investigate people’s beliefs about their perception of the risk of COVID - 19 . Threat perception included eight items and measured people’s beliefs about the extent of the COVID - 19 risk and about their risk of experiencing the disease . A 5 - point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree , 2 = disagree , 3 = neutral , 4 = agree , 5 = strongly agree ) was used to rate the scores and an overall row score rang - ing from 29 to 145 . The row scores were converted into a score of 0 to 100 where lower scores indicated lower risk perception and the higher scores indicated higher risk perception . The risk percept questionnaire is well - designed among Iranian population [ 23 ] . Danger con - trol and fear control were estimated by subtracting the perceived threat score from the perceived efficacy score ( self - plus response - efficacy divided by two ) , result - ing in a discriminating value . In the current estimation , a positive value presents that a person was engaging in danger control because she / he have had higher perceived efficacy score than perceived threat score . A negative value shows that a person was engaged in fear control because of having higher threat perception score than perception of efficacy . The SF - 36 QOL questionnaire is a generic measure - ment to assess self - reported health status , functioning and well - being . The psychometric properties of the Ira - nian version of SF - 36 are well documented [ 33 ] . Demographic information were questions about ( age , gender , history of COVID - 19 , having hypertension , having diabetes , having cardiovascular disease ( CAD ) . Statistical analysis The normality of the data was assessed using a Kolmogo - rov – Smirnov test and the normal distribution of data was confirmed . The characteristics of the participants were summarized as numbers , percentages , or means with standard deviations , where appropriate . Analysis of vari - ance ( ANOVA ) , chi - square and t - tests were used to com - pare the study sub - groups . In all tests , a value of p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Descriptive anal - ysis was done by tabulation of data and presentation of continuous variables as means and standard deviations and categorical variables as numbers and proportions . Various effect measures are available for quantifying the relationship between an intervention or a risk fac - tor and an outcome , such as the risk ratio and the odds ratio . Odds ratios are intended for use in case – control and cross - sectional studies . Univariate and multivari - able logistic regression were calculated to examine the effect of demographic characteristics , general health , and health - related quality of life on the fear control . In order to evaluate the multivariable logistic regressions , we used Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curves and cor - rectly classified values . The closer these values are to one hundred ( incorrectly classified value ) and one ( in ROC curve ) , the better the model fits . Data analysis was done using STATA v17 ( College Station , TX ) . Results Demographic characteristics Table 1 presents the descriptive characteristics of the par - ticipants . The mean age of the 350 participants was 67 . 9 ( 6 . 4 ) years . Men accounted for ( 59 . 4 % ) of study popula - tion . In the sample , 86 % of the participants were married ( 86 % ) and ( 30 . 5 % ) were illiterate . In total 17 . 7 % of the participants reported that they had high blood pressure , 10 . 3 % and 9 . 4 suffered from diabetes and cardiovascular disease , respectively . In this study , 15 . 2 % stated having two or more comorbidities and 17 . 7 % reported the his - tory of getting COVID - 19 . Page 4 of 9 Avazzadeh et al . Health and Quality of Life Outcomes ( 2023 ) 21 : 79 Risk perception and health related quality of life status Results of risk perception are shown in Table 2 . The sta - tistically significant differences were observed between age categories for efficacy , defensive responses ( denial , avoidance , and resistance ) , and susceptibility . The comparison of health related quality of life among age groups ( 60 – 70 and 71 ≥ ) are presented in Table 3 . Physical function is significantly different between the two groups ( p = 0 . 0001 ) , and more in the age group of 60 – 70 years . The Role - physical is significantly different between the two groups ( p = / 001 ) , and more in the age group of 71 years and older . There is no significant differ - ence between the other variables in the two age groups . The discriminating values to indicate danger control and fear control based on socio - demographic char - acteristics of participants were estimated ( Table 3 ) . A total of 83 . 1 % of participants were engaged in danger control processes and 16 . 9 % in fear control processes . The elderly participants in danger control group were more likely to deal with efficacy of recommended responses for prevention of COVID - 19 . Table 4 presents the results of univariate and mul - tivariable modeling , including odds ratios and their corresponding 95 % confidence interval for the associa - tion between the demographic characteristics , general health , and health - related quality of life with the fear control . According to the multivariable results , gen - der , education , economic status , body pain , general health , physical health and total quality of life were significant predictors of fear control . The women were 1 . 57 times more likely to have fear control ( P = 0 . 025 ) . Participants with illiterate education were 7 . 38 times more likely than other ducation level to show fear con - trol ( P = 0 . 017 ) . Also , People with good economic sta - tus were 2 . 70 times more likely to the fear control than intermediate status ( P = 0 . 029 ) . Increasing of body pain ( P = 0 . 041 ) , general health ( 0 . 032 ) , physical health ( P = 0 . 026 ) , and total quality of life ( P = 0 . 024 ) had protective effect on the fear of control .

Health and Quality of Life Outcomes ( 2023 ) 21 : 79 Discussion COVID - 19 appears to be contained by restrictive meas - ures implemented in some nations throughout the world [ 34 ] . These measures , on the other hand , have interrupted people’s regular jobs and activities , which might have serious consequences for their health and well - being [ 35 ] . This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the perception of risk of Covid - 19 and the quality of life of the elderly population . The results of our study showed that 83 % of elderly population was engaged in danger control responses and 17 % in fear control responses indicating that a fifth of our elderly participants had negative discriminating values . Since , most of elderly populations have adequately higher perceptions of efficacy to counteract their threat per - ceptions to continue motivating these older people to engage in COVID - 19 self - protective behaviors , it is nec - essary to emphasis on the susceptibility of target popu - lation and the severity of the COVID - 19 threats [ 36 ] . In the similar study [ 23 ] , older participants had higher self - efficacy sores than other group of populations for COVID - 19 prevention . Self - efficacy is part of a per - son’s attitudes , abilities , and cognitive skills reducing stress and tension [ 37 ] . This study was conducted dur - ing fourth wave ( between February and April 2021 ) of COVID - 19 pandemic in Iran while the country battles high infection rates with tighter restrictions [ 38 ] . Despite the fact that older individuals experience greater nega - tive outcomes during quarantines and social isolation for COVID - 19 [ 39 ] , older people exhibited increased self - efficacy [ 40 ] . This finding may be interpreted by adop - tion of social isolation and loneliness of older individuals prior COVI - 19 pandemic . Additional explanation return to personal characteristics of older individuals for better resilience and getting appropriate coping strategy in the case of crisis and stress full events [ 41 ] . According to the results of this study , strong associa - tions of fear control were found with being female , being illiterate , and having a good economic status and also body pain , general health , physical health and total qual - ity of life were significantly associated with danger con - trol . Findings of the study suggested that illiterate elderly people in the study setting were seven time more likely to engage in COVID - 19 fear control . Consistent with our results , a study from Iran reported that the highest COVID - 19 preventive behaviors related to people with higher education level [ 42 ] . Economic status plays an important role in adopting of preventive behaviors . Many COVID - 19 behaviors such as wearing masks , eating healthy foods , regularly washing hands and disinfection of surfaces need to spend money [ 43 ] . Older individu - als with low economic status and illiterate may receive inadequate care and family support . Our finding further highlights the importance of support services and facili - ties for mentioned older people . The findings of this study showed that the variables of efficacy , denial , defend , resistance and , susceptibility were significantly different in the two age groups as among older population those who were 60 – 70 years had higher scores than 71 years and more . Although during the Covid - 19 crisis , it was reported that people with chronic health problems were vulnerable groups with a poorer quality of life [ 44 ] , in our study diabetes , or hypertention or CAD factros were not associted with fear control . The results of our study consistent with previous research conducted during the pandemic investigated more characteristics of older individuals who were sus - ceptible and at significant risk for their health [ 45 , 46 ] . Because risk perception is inextricably connected to both psychological well - being and quarantine proce - dure observance [ 47 , 48 ] , It’s important to look at risk perception and the elements that have previously been identified in the literature in the older population . The fear control of COVID - 19 is not directly related to physical and social functioning due to several fac - tors . Fear control is an emotional response to Covid - 19 threats , and it can vary significantly among individuals regardless of their physical or social capabilities . Some - one who is physically fit and socially active may still expe - rience fear and anxiety about Covid - 19 , while others who have limitations in physical or social functioning may not necessarily exhibit higher levels of fear [ 49 , 50 ] . Addi - tionally , fear control involves various psychological and cognitive processes that are influenced by factors such as personal beliefs , information exposure , and past experi - ences . These factors can shape an individual’s perception of risk and their ability to manage fear , irrespective of their physical or social abilities . It is important to address fear and anxiety related to COVID - 19 through targeted interventions that consider the diverse psychological and emotional aspects of individuals , rather than solely focusing on their physical or social functioning [ 51 , 52 ] . As a result , prior experience dealing with various epi - demics , such as influenza and infectious illnesses like AIDS and hepatitis , may help physicians with more past job experience be more effective [ 53 ] . People who feel they are capable of doing the appropriate reaction , for example , “It is simple for me to utilize disinfectants” or “It is simple for me to obtain masks and disinfectants , ” have a high sense of self - efficacy , they also feel that follow - ing health advice is beneficial in avoiding Coronavirus” or “staying at home” ( recommended response ) works in averting the coronavirus threat , they have high perceived response efficacy . It appears that people’s intense percep - tions of the threat and efficacy of Coronavirus encourage Page 7 of 9 Avazzadeh et al . Health and Quality of Life Outcomes ( 2023 ) 21 : 79 them to take steps to mitigate the risk [ 23 ] . Denial of sickness is an ineffective coping technique for dealing with the issues that come with a chronic illness , includ - ing the greater risk of refusing to recognize the need for lifestyle adjustments [ 54 ] . It is crucial to identify patients who have a high incidence of denial to predict poor treat - ment adherence [ 55 ] and to devise strategies that make it easier for them to follow medical advice [ 29 , 56 ] . Denial may have a helpful impact on decreasing anxiety in some circumstances [ 57 ] . High denial indices allowed patients with end - stage renal illness to sleep better , had fewer personality changes , and have fewer interpersonal issues [ 58 ] . Furthermore , Dimsdale [ 59 ] found that patients in intensive care units who scored higher on the denial scale had a higher chance of surviving . Denial , on the other hand , allows for evasive kinds of non - adherence in illnesses like Type 2 DM , which can have serious impli - cations [ 57 ] . This result is in line with other studies con - ducted during the epidemics that reported a decrease in risk perception in the oldest - old [ 60 , 61 ] . The COVID - 19 pandemic is a huge public - health dan - ger , with elderly people in particular at risk of serious health repercussions [ 62 , 63 ] . The results of our studies showed that physical function is significantly different between the two groups and more in the age group of 60 – 70 years . The Role - physical variable is significantly different between the two groups ( p = 0 . 001 ) , and more in the age group of 71 years and older . This result is in line with the study by Won that analyzed the correlation between physical function and HRQOL and discovered that improved physical function enhances the quality of life [ 64 ] . Strengths and limitations One of the main strengths of this study is its ability to capture a snapshot of the predictors of fear control related to COVID - 19 among older population at a given point in time of Covid - 19 pandemic , providing valuable insights into fear control of Covid - 19 . Additionally , this study explore associations between socio - demographic factors , aiding in identifying potential risk or protective factors for Covid - 19 among aging individuals during the Covid - 19 pandemic . However , there are limitations to consider . Since data is collected from aging peo - ple at a single time point of Covid - 19 pandemic , this study may be subject to recall bias or inaccuracies in self - reporting , as participants may struggle to recall or report accurate information about their experiences during the pandemic . Another limitation is the poten - tial for selection bias , as participants may not be rep - resentative of the entire aging population , potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings . Conclusion Strong associations of fear control were found with being female , being illiterate , and having a good eco - nomic status and also body pain , general health , physi - cal health and total quality of life were significantly associated with danger control . The results of our study showed that 83 % of elderly population was engaged in danger control responses and 17 % in fear control responses indicating that a fifth of our elderly partici - pants had negative discriminating values . Since , most of elderly populations have adequately higher percep - tions of efficacy to counteract their threat perceptions to continue motivating these older people to engage in COVID - 19 self - protective behaviors , it is necessary to emphasis on the susceptibility of target population and the severity of the COVID - 19 threats . This study shows that perceived risk perception of Covid - 19 varies in different age groups and is lower in oldest - old adults . Therefore , paying attention to this group of people is necessary for prevention and care measures .
