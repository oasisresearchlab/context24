In the U . S . alone , the Spanish flu ( 1918 , virus serotype H1N1 ) , the Asian flu ( 1957 , serotype H2N2 ) , and the Hong Kong flu ( 1968 , serotype H3N2 ) Resource Distribution Strategies for Mitigation of Cross - Regional Influenza Pandemics Andres Uribe - Sanchez , University of South Florida , USA Alex Savachkin , University of South Florida , USA ABSTRACT As recently acknowledged by the Institute of Medicine , the existing pandemic mitigation models lack dynamic decision support capabilities . This paper develops a simulation optimization model for generating dynamic resource distribution strategies over a network of regions exposed to a pandemic . While the underlying simulation mimics the disease and population dynamics of the affected regions , the optimization model gen - erates progressive allocations of mitigation resources , including vaccines , antivirals , healthcare capacities , and social distancing enforcement measures . The model strives to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of the potential outbreaks , considering measures of morbidity , mortality , and social distancing , translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses . The model was implemented on a simulated outbreak involving four million inhabitants . The strategy was compared to pro - rata and myopic strategies . The model is intended to assist public health policy makers in developing effective distribution policies during influenza pandemics . resulted in the death toll of more than 500 , 000 , 70 , 000 and 34 , 000 cases , respectively ( Longini , Halloran , Nizam , & Yang , 2004 ) . In recent years , a series of scattered outbreaks of the avian - to - human transmittable H5N1 virus has been mapping its way through Asia , the Pacific region , Africa , the Near East , and Europe ( Cen - ters for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC , 2008 ) . As of March 2010 , WHO has reported 287 deaths in 486 worldwide cases ( World Health Organization , 2010a ) .

Nowadays , most experts have an ominous expectation that the next pandemic will be triggered by an emerg - ing pathogenic virus , to which there is little or no pre - existing immunity ( Schoenstadt , 2010 ) . The nation’s ability to mitigate influenza pandemics depends on available emergency response infrastructure and resources , and at present , challenges abound . Prediction of the exact virus subtype remains a difficult task , and even when identified , reaching an adequate vaccine supply can take between six and nine months ( Aunins , Lee , & Volkin , 1995 ; Fedson , 2003 ) . Even if the emerged virus has a known epidemiology , the existing stockpiles will be limited due to high manufacturing and inven - tory costs ( WHO Global Influenza Programme , 2009 ; World Health Organization , 2009 ) . The supply of antiviral drugs , healthcare providers , hospital beds , medical supplies , and logistics will also be significantly constrained . Hence , pandemic mitigation will have to be done amidst a limited knowledge of the virus nature , constrained infrastructure , and limited resource availability . This ongoing challenge has been acknowledged by WHO ( 2009 ) and echoed by the HHS and CDC ( Centers for Disease Con - trol and Prevention , 2009 ; U . S . Department of Health & Human Services , 2007 ) . The existing literature on pandemic in - fluenza ( PI ) modeling aims to address various complex aspects of the pandemic evolution process including : ( 1 ) the underlying spatio - temporal structure , ( 2 ) contact dynamics and disease transmission , ( 3 ) disease natural history , and ( 4 ) analysis and development of mitigation strategies . A comprehensive decision support model for PI containment and mitigation has to invariably consider all of the above aspects : it must incorporate the mechanism of disease progression , from the initial infection , to the asymptomatic phase , manifestation of symp - toms , and the final health outcome ( Atkinson & Wein , 2008 ; Handel , Longini , & Antia , 2010 ; Pourbohloul et al . , 2009 ) ; it must also consider the population dynamics , including individual susceptibility ( Pitzer , Leung , & Lipsitch , 2007 ; Pitzer , Olsen , Bergstrom , Dowell , & Lipsitch , 2007 ) and transmissibility ( Cauchemez , Carrat , Viboud , Valleron , & Boelle , 2004 ; Handel et al . , 2010 ; Yang , Halloran , Sugimoto , & Longini , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) , and behavioral fac - tors affecting infection generation and disease progression ( Colizza , Barrat , Barthélemy , & Vespignani , 2006 ; Epstein , Parker , Cummings , & Hammond , 2008 ; Halloran , 2006 ) ; finally , it must incorporate the impact of pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical measures , including vaccination ( Ball & Lyne , 2002 ; Becker & Starczak , 1997 ; Carrat , Lavenu , Cauchemez , & Deleger , 2006 ) , antiviral therapy ( Fergu - son , Mallett , Jackson , Roberts , & Ward , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Lipsitch , Cohen , Murray , & Levin , 2007 ) , social distancing ( Halder , Kelso , & Milne , 2010 ; Kelso , Milne , & Kelly , 2009 ; Miller , Randolph , & Patterson , 2008 ; Milne , Kelso , Kelly , Huband , & McVernon , 2008 ; Yasuda & Suzuki , 2009 ) and travel restrictions , and the use of low - cost measures , such as face masks and hand washing ( Glass , Glass , Beyeler , & Min , 2006 ; Lipsitch et al . , 2007 ; Nigmatulina & Larson , 2009 ; Scharfstein , Halloran , Chu , & Daniels , 2006 ) . In recent years , the models for PI contain - ment and mitigation have focused on integration of pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical mea - sures in search for synergistic strategies , aimed at better resource utilization . Most of these ap - proaches aim to implement a scheme of social distancing to reduce infection exposure , fol - lowed by application of pharmaceutical means . Significant contributions in this challenging area include ( Chao , Halloran , Obenchain , & Longini , 2010 ; Colizza , Barrat , Barthelemy , Valleron , & Vespignani , 2007 ; Cooley et al . , 2008 ; Glass et al . , 2006 ; Longini et al . , 2004 ; Mills , Robins , & Lipsitch , 2004 ; Patel & Longini , 2005 ; Wu , Riley , Fraser , & Leung , 2006 ) .
