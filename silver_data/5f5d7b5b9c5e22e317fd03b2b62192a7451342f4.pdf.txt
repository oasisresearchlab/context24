The aim of this study was to address some critical aspects of these processes . Our model was the Na + , K + - ATPase ( NKA ) , because it represents an integral membrane protein that is physiologically regulated within the cell by altering the amount of active molecules in the plasma membrane in response to G - protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) signals such as dopamine , and angiotensin II , among others . The following conclusions were drawn from the results obtained in this thesis : (cid:153) Binding of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3K ) to the NKA and its activation in response to dopamine requires that the NKA becomes phosphorylated by protein kinase C ( PKC ) - ζ . Phosphorylation of Ser - 18 promotes the binding of 14 - 3 - 3 - ε / β to the α - subunit which then functions as an anchor for the PI - 3K . (cid:153) Binding of adaptor proteins to the NKA is a necessity for its internalization by clathrin - coated vesicle formation . Phosphorylation of adaptor protein - 2 ( AP2 ) μ 2 subunit is under the control of PKC - ζ , which represents an essential signal that triggers the association of AP2 to the NKA α - subunit . (cid:153) Phosphorylation of AP2 μ 2 subunit has a wide biological significance during NKA endocytosis . Studies in lung epithelial cells demonstrated that in the presence of AP2 μ 2 subunit negative mutant ( lacking the phosphorylation site ) , hypoxia - generated reactive oxygen species failed to promote the removal of NKA from the plasma membrane . (cid:153) INAD [ a multiple PSD - 95 / Discs - large / ZO - 1 ( PDZ ) domain - containing protein ] provides a higher level of GPCR signaling organization during dopamine - , angiotensin II - , and insulin - dependent regulation of NKA activity in renal epithelial cells . (cid:153) It appears that selective PDZ domains within inactivation - no - after potential ( INAD ) provide selectivity to the GPCR response , depending on whether the signals are inhibitory ( dopamine ) or stimulatory ( angiotensin II and insulin ) . The latter also reflects that while inhibitory signals need to be assembled at the plasma membrane ( endocytosis ) , stimulatory signals ( recruitment ) may do so at the endosomal membrane . Taken together these results have provided additional new information , have clarified and improved our understanding on relevant mechanisms by which signals originated at the plasma membrane could be translated and integrated in a hierarchical manner to avoid deleterious cross - talk during regulation of membrane protein traffic . 2 LIST OF PUBLICATIONS I .

INTRODUCTION In order to proliferate , differentiate , or undergo apoptosis , as well as communicate with each other , cells need to process , transform and transduce information from the extracellular space . For the unicellular organism , it is mainly the environment that provides cells with the information . For the multicellular organism , it is not only the environment but also the neighboring cells as well as cells of the same organ from far away and the matrix that holds them together that guide and co - ordinate its growth and differentiation throughout a great variety of signals . Signal transduction can be defined as pathways originated from extracellular ( physical or chemical ) signals transferred into the cytoplasm and / or nucleus that result into a myriad of cellular responses ( Hucho and Buchner , 1997 ) . After being transduced across the plasma membrane , signals are carried by the sequential interaction of proteins ( messenger ) to defined subcellular locations . This often leads to the “activation” of proteins which may either be enzymes or ion channels among many , which enhance the signals by producing a series of intracellular events . These multiple amplification steps in a chain of events are often referred to as a signaling cascade . In addition to the amplification , intracellular signaling proteins are often constrained in a specific subcellular location to enhance the interaction efficiency between different signaling components and for maintaining specificity . The landmark findings of this field started with the discovery in the mid - 1950s that phosphorylation can reversibly alter the activity of an enzyme through the combined action of a protein kinase and a protein phosphatase ( Krebs and Beavo , 1979 ) . At the same time hormones such as adrenalin and glucagon were found to increase the level of intracellular 3’5’ cyclic AMP , creating the concept of the secondary messengers . About 10 years later the cAMP - dependent protein - serine kinase ( PKA ) was isolated as a target for cAMP , and through its pleiotropic substrate specificity PKA was shown to be responsible for many of the effects of cAMP . With these findings the field of signal transduction was initiated ( Hunter , 2000 ) . 1 . 1 CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS All water - soluble molecules bind to specific receptor proteins on the surface of the target cells . Most cell - surface receptors belong to one of three classes according to their structural and functional properties . For example : the ion - channel - linked receptors are involved in rapid synaptic signaling between electrically excitable cells ; G - protein - coupled receptors act indirectly to regulate the activity of a separate plasma - membrane - bound target protein , which can either be an enzyme or an ion channel ; and enzyme - linked receptors when activated either function directly as enzymes or are directly associated with enzymes that they activate . 7 1 . 1 . 1 Signaling through G ‐ protein ‐ coupled receptor G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCR ) require the coupling of a trimeric GTP - binding protein ( G protein ) for their activation ( Lin et al . , 1977 ; Neer , 1995 ) . They are the largest and most diverse receptor family in the human genome with more than 1000 members identified , which all share a common structure of seven membrane - spanning helices connected by intra - and extracellular loops ( Dixon et al . , 1986 ; Henderson et al . , 1990 ) . GPCRs mediate a wide variety of stimuli such as hormones , neurotransmitters , light and odorants . The degree of homology between family members ranges from 20 - 30 % for receptors with unrelated ligands and to 50 - 80 % for subtypes of receptor with same or similar ligands ( Strader et al . , 1994 ) . The G proteins are heterotrimeric proteins consisting of α , β , γ subunits . The α subunits are the largest ( 39 - 46 kDa ) , which contain the guanine nucleotide binding site whereas the β ( 35 - 36 kDa ) and γ ( around 8 kDa ) subunits form stable noncovalent complexes , which associates with membrane more tightly ( Hepler and Gilman , 1992 ) . The model of the GPCRs’ activation has been proposed by ( Neer , 1995 ) . The receptor is activated upon agonist binding , which then activates the GDP associated G protein via direct interaction resulting in the switch from GDP to GTP associated G protein followed by its dissociation of each other from the receptor . The free GTP - bound α - subunit and βγ - complex modulate the activity of a variety of effectors such as ion channels or particular isoforms of adenylyl cyclase and PLC , as well as of PI - 3K isoforms . Signaling is terminated through the GTP hydrolysis by the intrinsic GTPase activity of α subunit which is a slow process in vitro but can be accelerated by various effectors in vivo . The functional versatility of the G protein - mediated signaling system is based on its modular architecture and on the fact that there are numerous subtypes of G proteins . The basic properties of the G protein are determined by the α - subunits which can be grouped into four families : G α s , G α i / G α o , G α q / G α 11 , and G α 12 / G α 13 . Each family has various members that often have very specific expression patterns . The βγ - complex of mammalian G proteins is assembled from a repertoire of 5 β - subunits and 12 γ - subunits ( Wettschureck and Offermanns , 2005 ) . Most receptors are able to activate more than one G protein subtype . The renal dopamine receptors Outside the central nervous system , dopamine receptors have been described in the kidney , adrenergic nerve endings , and in numerous blood vessels ( renal , pulmonary , mesenteric and coronary arteries ) ( Jose et al . , 1998 ) . Dopamine not only regulates renal hemodynamics and electrolyte and water transport but also renin secretion through an independent peripheral dopaminergic system . Dopamine exerts its actions via a class of cell surface receptors that belongs to the rhodopsin - like family of G - protein - coupled receptors ( Schwartz , 1996 ) . There are totally five dopamine receptors characterized and classified according to their 8 pharmacological properties ( e . g . , agonists and antagonists , linkage to cyclic AMP [ cAMP ] ) ( Kebabian and Calne , 1979 ) . D 1 and D 5 belong to the D 1 - like subtype coupled to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase whereas D 2 , D 3 and D 4 belong to the D 2 - like subtype linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase . To contrast the receptor classification in the central nervous system , the peripheral dopamine receptors are classified into the DA 1 and DA 2 subtypes even though both the D 1 - like and DA 1 receptors and D 2 - like and DA 2 receptors share common pharmacological properties ( Goldberg , 1986 ) . The affinity of the D 1 - like receptor in the kidney to D 1 - like ligands is lower than in the brain but there appears to be no difference in the coding sequence between central and peripheral dopamine receptors ( Felder et al . , 1984a ; Felder et al . , 1984b ; Felder and Jose , 1988 ; Nakajima and Kuruma , 1980 ; Sidhu et al . , 1990 ; Zdilar and Lackovic , 1989 ) . Although a short and a long isoform of D 1 receptor mRNA is present in neural tissue , only the short variant is expressed in renal tissue ( Lee et al . , 1997 ) . Dopamine exerts its effects depending on the tissue and species specific localization of the receptors . Such as in the rat kidney , both DA 1 and DA 2 are present in renal vessels and renal cortex , whereas only DA 2 is in glomeruli and renal medulla ( Amenta , 1990 ; Amenta , 1997 ; Felder and Jose , 1988 ; Hedge et al . , 1989 ; Huo and Healy , 1989 ; Huo et al . , 1991 ; Missale et al . , 1988 ; Nakajima and Kuruma , 1980 ; Takemoto et al . , 1991 ) . Different renal tubule segments express different dopamine receptor subtype , such as DA 1 are in proximal tubule , PCT , PST ( Felder et al . , 1984a ; Felder et al . , 1984b ; Felder , 1988 . ; Felder et al . , 1988 ) , medullary thick ascending limb of the Henle ( Takemoto et al . , 1991 ) macula densa ( Amenta and Ricci , 1990 ; Ricci et al . , 1993 ) and collecting duct ( Ohbu and Felder , 1991 ; Takemoto et al . , 1991 ) , but DA 2 receptors are only in proximal tubule and medullary collecting ducts ( Amenta , 1990 ; Barili et al . , 1997 ; Felder et al . , 1989 ; Huo and Healy , 1989 ) . In general , dopamine receptor expression level in the periphery is much lower than in the central nervous system . For example , DA 1 expression is highest in PCT ( Felder et al . , 1984a ; Kinoshita et al . , 1990 ; Ohbu and Felder , 1991 ; Takemoto et al . , 1991 ) , but the D1 receptor density in the PCT is only about 25 % of that noted in the brain striatum ( Yamaguchi et al . , 1995 ) . The expression pattern ( localization ) of one receptor subtype also differs in polarized epithelial cell in terms of their basolateral or luminal domains , and this determines which side of the epithelium for dopamine to act on ( Felder et al . , 1989 ) . In OK cells , there is only one type of dopamine receptor - D 1 receptors which is present in both luminal and basolateral membranes ( Nash et al . , 1993 ) , whereas in rat proximal tubule , DA 1 receptors are present in both plasma membrane domains , and among the DA 2 subtype only D 3 is present at the apical ( O ' Connell et al . , 1998 ) . The renal angiotensin II receptors Angiotensin II ( AT II ) belongs to the rennin - angiotensin system ( RAS ) which is a critical regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis . It has been suggested that 9 control of sodium excretion by the kidney is the dominant mechanism of blood pressure regulation by the RAS ( Guyton , 1991 ) . AT II receptors can be divided into two pharmacologic classes ( type 1 [ AT1 ] and type 2 [ AT2 ] ) based on their differential affinities for various nonpeptide antagonists ( Shanmugam and Sandberg , 1996 ) . Cloning of the human AT1 and AT2 receptors revealed that they are seven transmembrane - spanning GPCR ( de Gasparo et al . , 2000 ) and encoded by single copy gene found on chromosome 3 and X , respectively ( Thomas and Mendelsohn , 2003 ) . Even though AT1 and AT2 have similar affinity to AT II , they only share 30 % sequence similarity at amino acid level ( Thomas and Mendelsohn , 2003 ) . Two subtypes , designated AT1a and AT1b have been identified in rodents which have distinct expression pattern but similar coding sequence . AT1a receptors predominate in most organs including kidney , liver , adrenal gland , ovary , brain , testes , adipose tissue , lung , and the heart of adult mice . AT1b is absent in most of these tissues but detectable in brain , testis , and adrenal gland ( Burson et al . , 1994 ) . The present view is that there is no human counterpart to the rodent AT1b receptor , thus the AT1a receptor is considered the rodent homologue to the single human AT1 receptor ( Crowley et al . , 2007 ) and AT1a is detectable in OK cells . Studies with the use of the antagonists suggest that most of the functions of the RAS to increase blood pressure are mediated by AT1r ( Timmermans et al . , 1993 ) , which is expressed in the organs that are presumed to play key roles in blood pressure homeostasis , including the circulatory system , the nervous system , and the kidney ( Shanmugam and Sandberg , 1996 ) . In the kidney , activation of AT1r leads to renal vasoconstriction and increased tubular sodium reabsorption . AT1r are predominantly coupled to G q / 11 , and signal through phospholipases A , C , D , inositol phosphates , and a variety of serine / threonine and tyrosine kinases , G q - mediated activation of phospholipase C followed by phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca 2 + signaling ( Feraille and Doucet , 2001 ) . 1 . 1 . 2 Signaling through tyrosine kinase receptor Enzyme - linked receptors are a second major type of cell - surface receptors which can be classified according to the type of kinase activity they contain or associate with . Receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates specific tyrosine on a small set of intracellular signaling proteins . They are transmembrane proteins with their ligand - binding domain on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and the cytosolic domain containing the intrinsic enzyme kinase activity . Structurally different from GPCR , each subunit of an enzyme - linked receptor usually has only one transmembrane segment but an extended extracellular segment , which consists of multiple modular protein domains . Upon activation , two or more receptor chains come together in the membrane forming a dimer or higher oligomer ( Heldin , 1995 ) . In some cases , ligand binding induces the oligomerization . In other cases , the oligomerization occurs before ligand binding , and the ligand causes a reorientation of the receptor in the membrane . In either case , the 10 rearrangement induced in the cytosolic tails of the receptors initiates the intracellular signaling process . For tyrosine kinase receptors , this cross - linking leads to the kinase domains of the receptors to phosphorylate each other on multiple tyrosine residues which is called receptor - autophosphorylation . The phosphotyrosine residues on the activated receptor then serve as docking sites for other intracellular signaling proteins with Src homology ( SH2 ) domains ( Coughlin et al . , 1989 ; Pawson , 1995 ) or phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domains ( Kavanaugh and Williams , 1994 ) . The insulin receptors Insulin affects both metabolic and transport functions of renal tubules , it exerts its antinatriuretic effect in the kidney at least partly by increasing transepithelial Na + transport which is mediated via stimulation of NKA at the basolateral membrane and Na + / H + exchanger at the brush - border . The insulin receptors are made of covalent dimers with two α subunits and two β subunits crossing plasma membrane linked by disulfide bonds to form a tetramer . The insulin binding sites reside in extracellular domains of two α subunits while two β subunits contain the tyrosine kinase activity in the intracellular domains . It is coded by a single gene with 22 exons , the first 11 exons form the α subunit and the rest form the β subunit ( Seino et al . , 1989 ) . Exon 11 is alternatively spliced resulting in two isoforms of the receptor named A and B ( Seino and Bell , 1989 ) . Most of the phosphotyrosine docking sites generated by ligand binding are not on the receptor itself but on specialized docking proteins called insulin receptor substrates ( IRS ) ( Fantin et al . , 1998 ; Lavan and Lienhard , 1993 ; Patti et al . , 1995 ) . Upon to activation , the kinase domain of the receptors autophosphorylates each other , which then phosphorylate IRS on multiple tyrosines’ thereby creating more docking sites than on the receptor alone . Insulin receptors are ubiquitously expressed although they have predominant expression in liver and fat and skeletal muscle for their important function of increasing glucose uptake . Localization of insulin receptors in the nephron has been characterized by ligand - binding assay ( Nakamura et al . , 1983 ) which showed that proximal tubule has the second highest expression level next to the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule . The insulin receptors are present in both basolateral and apical domains with a predominant role in the basolateral domain ( Talor et al . , 1982 ) . 1 . 2 MEMBRANE PROTEIN TRAFFIC IN EUKARYOTIC CELLS Eukaryotic cells have subcellular compartments which are enclosed by membrane with distinct protein and lipids composition such as the plasma membrane is marked by phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , while phosphatidylinositol ( 3 ) - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) is a predominant component of the endosomes . To maintain such organelle membrane identity and function , transmembrane proteins along with the lipids , especially the major membrane identity markers , must be transported between organelles ( Owen , 2004 ) . 11 Figure 1 . Clathrin vesicle formation . The target protein ( blue ) is signaled ( red ) to be transported by mechanisms that may involve phosphorylation that leads to adaptor protein - 2 recruitment ( dark blue ) followed by clathrin recruitment , and clathrin - coated pit formation . Simultaneously , a process aimed at vesicle fission is initiated by the recruitment of dynamin ( by phosphorylation , green ) and numerous anchor proteins that may be tissue specific ( white ) . The assembly of dynamin at the neck of the clathrin - coated pit initiates the fission process and release of the vesicle . Such process is called intracellular membrane traffic and together with extracellular communication they define the protein traffic in eukaryotic cells . Protein traffic is mediated by spherical vesicles which are generally accepted of the size around 60 - 100 - nm - diameter ( Dalton and Felix , 1954 ) . Transport vesicles are defined by the protein coat used in their formation , and also by the cargo they contain . One of the major classes of transport vesicle is the clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) , so named because the predominant protein present in their coats is clathrin ( Pearse , 1975 ) . The other two well - characterized types of coated vesicles are COPI - coated , COPII - coated vesicles ( Baker et al . , 1988 ; Novick et al . , 1981 ) . Each of them mediates transport from different compartments , such as CCVs mediate transport from the Golgi apparatus and from plasma membrane , whereas COPII - and COPI - coated vesicles mediate transport from the ER and the Golgi cisternae respectively ( Kirchhausen , 2000 ) . 1 . 2 . 1 General mechanisms of clathrin ‐ coated vesicle traffic Among three characterized vesicles , CCV was the first discovered and is also one of the most thoroughly studied vesicles . CCVs can be found in all nucleated cells , from yeast to human . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the major process by which receptors and other integral membrane proteins and lipids are removed from the plasma membrane and delivered into the endosomes ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) . It is a process that requires the participation of several sequential stages , including cargo recognition or vesicle initiation , followed by vesicle formation , fission , and release ( see Figure 1 ) . ( PP2A ) ( PI3K ‐ dynamin ) ( endophilin ) ( adaptor ‐ clathrin ) ( cargo selection ) ( vesicle fission ) ( vesicle release ) 12 The major protein components of CCVs are clathrin and adaptors . Structural studies revealed that clathrin has a special molecular architecture which is in a spider - like shape with three legs radiating from a central hub . This three - legged triskelion consists of three large and three small polypeptide chains capable of forming cage - liked shape with clathrin lattice on the outside of the structure , which resembles the seam of a soccer ball ( Kirchhausen and Harrison , 1981 ; Ungewickell and Branton , 1981 ) . Such clathrin lattice can either be hexagon or pentagon , but to form a closed structure there must be 12 of the latter . Additional pentagons can be added only if there are corresponding numbers of hexagons . It has been elegantly shown by electron microscopic images that flat arrays of clathrin hexagons extend on the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane ( Heuser , 1980 ) . It is not possible to introduce pentagon without massive local disassembly . Therefore , the common view of clathrin - vesicle formation , particularly the membrane curvature formation , requires the rearrangement of clathrin lattice which has been suggested to be mediated by heat shock protein 70 family ( hsp70 ) and auxilin ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ) . The biochemical properties of clathrin have also been analyzed . In isolation from the vesicle , each heavy chain has a molecular mass around 190 kDa while the light chain is around 25 kDa . The second major coat protein in the CCVs is a multi - subunit adaptor protein complex which is required during vesicle formation by binding simultaneously clathrin and various transmembrane target proteins ( Figure 1 , cargo selection ) . In this way , the target proteins are packaged into each newly formed CCVs . There are at least four types of adaptors which are used by CCVs when budding from different membranes and thus package different cargo molecules . As the clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) grows , soluble cytoplasmic proteins , including dynamin , assemble as a ring around the neck of each bud ( Figure 1 , vesicle fission ) . Dynamin is a GTPase capable of self - assembly into rings and tubes in vitro and this leads to the proposal that dynamin utilizes the energy derived from ATP - hydrolysis to regulate the vesicle pinching - off from the membrane ( Figure 1 , vesicle fission ) . Additionally , dynamin also recruits other proteins with lipid - modifying properties to the neck of the budding vesicle via its proline - rich motif . Two of such candidates have been identified : endophilin , a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase ( Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) whose products may favor the lipid - bilayer deformation ; and amphyphysin , that brings the lipid phosphatase synaptojanin to change the lipid composition ( McNiven , 1998 ; Schmid et al . , 1998 ; Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . Once the vesicle is released from the membrane , the clathrin coat is rapidly lost and the free clathrin chains are ready to recycle for new vesicle formation . Hsp70 together with auxilin is responsible for the clathrin - coat disassembly . Auxilin has a J domain which can recruit hsp70 and thus generating energy for uncoating CCV by hydrolysing ATP ( Barouch et al . , 1997 ; Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . The released vesicles are highly selective in recognizing the correct target membrane with which to fuse . The specificity is ensured by displaying surface markers on both the transport vesicles and the target membrane . This critical recognition step is controlled by two classes of proteins : SNAREs ( soluble NSF attachment receptor ) and targeting monomeric GTPase called 13 Rab . SNARE proteins have a role in providing specificity and catalyzing the fusion of vesicles . Rab regulates the initial docking and tethering the vesicle to the target membrane . The architecture of CCVs can be summarized into three layers : the inner membrane layer , in which the transmembrane cargo is embedded , linked to the outer clathrin lattice by a layer of cargo - binding adaptors and proteins that aids and regulates vesicle formation . The adaptor protein family ( AP ) contains five members : AP1 , AP2 , AP3 , AP4 and the β , γ , δ , ξ subcomplex of COP I ( Boehm and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . The predominant adaptor in CME is the AP2 complex , which binds to both protein cargo and plasma membrane phospholipids headgroups as well as to clathrin . Moreover , there are more than 20 clathrin - associated sorting proteins required for successful clathrin coat assembly ( Owen , 2004 ) , such as autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia ( ARH ) for low density lipid ( LDL ) internalization ( Mishra et al . , 2002 ) and β - arrestin for GPCRs ( Goodman et al . , 1996 ) . Four different internalization motifs may require different adaptor to interact . The YXX Ф and the [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] motifs are recognized by AP2 while the FXNPXXY - type signal is recognized by disabled 2 ( Dab2 ) and ARH ( Hawryluk et al . , 2006 ; Maurer and Cooper , 2006 ) as well as ubiquitinated motifs by EGFR pathway substrate clone NO . 15 ( Eps15 / Eps15R ) ( Traub and Lukacs , 2007 ) . The AP2 complex is a heterotetramer of around 300 kDa which is composed of two large subunits of 100 - 130 kDa ( α and β 2 ) , a medium subunit of ~ 50 kDa ( μ 2 ) , and a small subunit of 17 - 20kDa ( σ 2 ) ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ; Traub , 1997 ) . The large subunits can be subdivided into a trunk ( 70 - 75 kDa ) and an appendage domain ( ~ 30 kDa ) joined by an extended , proteolytically sensitive flexible linker . The trunk domain of the large subunits ( α and β 2 ) tightly associate with μ 2 and σ 2 subunits which form the core of the AP2 complex ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1989 ; Zaremba and Keen , 1985 ) . The AP2 core structure has been resolved by ( Collins et al . , 2002a ) , the N - terminal domains of α and β composed of α helices lie parallel to each other and define the pocket where μ 2 and σ 2 fit in . The σ 2 subunit shares significant sequence similarity with N - terminal domain μ 2 which is connected to the C - terminal domain of μ 2 subunit via a flexible linker . Several important binding sites on the AP2 complex can be summarized as the following : AP2 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via the α and μ 2 subunits , to Yxx Φ - type sorting signals via μ 2 ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ; Owen and Evans , 1998a ) , and to [ DE ] xxxL [ LI ] dileucine motifs probably via an α / σ 2 subunit hemicomplex ( Janvier et al . , 2003 ) . The AP2 β 2 appendage platform has been shown to bind two clathrin associated proteins , β - arrestin and epsin via an α - helical [ DE ] n x 1 - 2 Fxx [ FL ] xxxR motif ( Edeling et al . , 2006 ) . The β 2 subunit also interacts with clathrin through the L Φ D / E Φ D / E in the β 2 hinge ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , the α - appendage domain also functionally recruits endocytic accessory proteins by recognising at least four different types of peptide motifs ( DPF / W , FxDxF , WVxF and FxxFxxL ) via two subdomains . The binding partners create a large family with more than 20 members including eps15 , intersectin , epsin , amphyphysin , synaptojanin and dynamin ( Praefcke et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , after recruitment by recognition of the cargo and lipids , AP2 functions as a central hub for 14 rapid selection of accessory proteins to the endocytic site and this is subsequently followed by clathrin polymerization ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . For the recognition of the cargo via the Yxx Φ motif , AP2 undergoes a conformational change to switch into an active state upon to association with clathrin and phosphoinositides as the binding site on the μ 2 is buried in the trunk domains between α and β 2 ( Collins et al . , 2002b ) . Moreover , the importance of phosphorylation of T156 in μ 2 linker for regulating the conformational change has been recognized in several studies . Therefore the possible functioning model of AP2 complex has been proposed in the light of this structure regulation . Inactive AP2s would be concentrated at endocytic sites by interaction with membrane proteins and phospholipids . It is then activated via phosphorylation by several candidate kinases including GAK ( cyclin G - associated kinase ) ( Umeda et al . , 2000 ) and AAK ( adaptor - associated kinase ) ( Conner and Schmid , 2002a ; Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) to turn into an open conformation with high affinity for protein cargo . This open AP2 with its bound cargo then incorporate into CCVs through its clathrin binding motif within its β 2 hinge ( Rapoport et al . , 1997 ) . 1 . 2 . 2 Receptor regulated membrane protein traffic The activity of integral membrane proteins can either be regulated in a fast or a slow process depending on the nature of the stimuli . For the long - term regulation ( a slow process ) , it can involve either changes in the synthesis or a change in the rate of degradation of the protein . For short - term regulation ( fast process ) , it could be either a change in its catalytic activity or its rapid change in surface expression that is achieved by having a pool of ready - synthesized molecules available in intracellular compartments . This pool resides in the endosome compartments and is formed by the constitutive internalization of proteins from the surface . The proportion of the protein at the surface and in the endosome compartments depends on the relative rates of endocytosis and exocytosis . Some proteins ( eg . receptors ) go through rapid constitutive internalization and then slowly recycle back to the surface . Therefore , under basal conditions they exist predominantly within intracellular compartments but rapidly recycle back to the plasma membrane in response to signals . Vesicle - mediated membrane traffic has been considered not only to be a constitutive process but also a highly regulated one in response to extracellular signals . This regulation is thought to underlie some important biological phenomena such as learning and memory , gastric acid secretion and water and blood glucose homeostasis . A good example is the glucose transporter GLUT4 expressed in muscle and fat cells . A rise in insulin levels causes a net translocation of this protein to the cell surface and it is via this mechanism that insulin promotes glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells . This type of regulation is called the receptor - mediated membrane protein traffic . 15 1 . 2 . 3 Membrane transporters are regulated by extracellular signals One important class of plasma membrane proteins are the ion / solute transporters ( i . e . , ion channels , co - transporters , exchangers and ion pumps ) . Particularly in the epithelial cells of kidney , airways and intestine , it is crucial to have the correct transport properties to obtain directional transepithelial transport . This is achieved by polarization of epithelial cell membrane into two domains—the apical and basolateral domains with distinct lipids and proteins composition that are separated by tight junctions . The differentiation of epithelial cells has two processes : apico - basal polarization and asymmetrical protein expression . The first process leads to the formation of apical and basolateral domains that are separated by tight junctions . The second process ensures the asymmetrical sorting of proteins to the polarized membrane domains . Once distributed to the correct domain , the membrane transporters are under the influence of extracellular signals such as hormones . In general , hormones function by activating their receptors which can be either the cell - surface receptors or the cytosolic receptors with which they enter the cell nucleus to influence the transcription . In the kidney , peptide hormones , e . g . parathyroid hormone and vasopressin , and catecholamines , e . g . , epinephrine and dopamine , bind to GPCR and lead to the activation of adenylyl cyclases . In addition , peptide hormones , e . g . , parathyroid hormone , AT II and catecholamines , e . g . , norepinephrine and dopamine , bind to GPCR to trigger PLC - β and subsequent PKC activation . Insulin and many growth factors , e . g . , IGF - I , EGF , and PDGF , share the property to activate the receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity . Parathyroid hormone inhibits apical Na + / H + exchanger activity by increasing its endocytosis which is dependent on both the phosphorylation by cAMP induced kinase ( Pollock et al . , 1986 ) and the localization of the PKA by a cofactor NHERF ( Na + / H + exchanger regulation factor ) ( Zizak et al . , 1999 ) . The apical Na + / H + exchanger activity is also inhibited by dopamine via endocytosis ( Felder et al . , 1990 ) , which provides the simultaneous effect with dopamine mediated inhibitory effect on the basolateral NKA to limit the sodium reabsorption . This is one of the major mechanisms that regulate sodium transport across the proximal tubules in the kidney . The cellular signaling mechanisms are partly understood . The activation of DA1 receptor leads to the activation of both adenylyl cyclase and PLC . Adenylyl cyclase generates cAMP which activates PKA to phosphorylate Na + / H + exchanger followed by its subsequent endocytosis . PLC generates DAG which activates PKC to phosphorylate NKA which also leads to its endocytosis ( reviewed by ( Hussain and Lokhandwala , 2003 ) . Similarly , at the nM concentration AT II has stimulatory effects on both Na + / H + exchanger and NKA by increasing their exocytosis which may function synergistically to increase sodium reabsorption . All the resulting activation of intracellular signaling pathway leads to the modification of membrane transporters . 16 1 . 3 NA , K ‐ ATPASE AS A MODEL TO STUDY PROTEIN TRAFFIC NKA was discovered in 1957 by JC Skou as an integral - membrane protein with catalytic ATPase activity ( Skou , 1957 ) . During each transport cycle , 3 Na + are transferred out of and 2 K + into the cell in consumption of 1 ATP molecule by hydrolysis ( Garrahan and Glynn , 1967 ) . NKA consists of a catalytic α and regulatory β subunit , a γ subunit co - expresses in some tissue such as renal tubule cells . The large α subunit has a molecular weight of 112 , 000 Da and the smaller β subunit around 55 , 000 Da ( Lingrel and Kuntzweiler , 1994 ) . Both β and γ subunits are single pass transmembrane proteins , while the α - subunit has 10 transmembrane domains with N - and C - terminus located in the cytosol . The α - subunit contains the binding sites for ATP , Na + , K + and ouabain as well as regulatory phosphorylation sites . The accessory β subunit is important for the maturation and transport of the enzyme to the plasma membrane ( Geering , 1991 ) whereas the γ subunit has been indicated to increase the affinity of α subunit for ATP and shifting the conformational equilibrium towards E1 ( Therien et al . , 2001 ) . Three isoforms of α and β subunits have been identified in mammals . They express in a tissue - and development - specific manner , except α 1 and β 1 subunits are ubiquitous ( Lingrel , 1992 ) . NKA is expressed in all animal cells . It regulates the cell volume and maintains the intracellular Na + concentration lower than extracellular and the reverse for K + . The Na + gradient produced by the pump drives the transport of most nutrients into animal cells and also has an important role in regulating cytosolic pH . One - third of the energy requirement of a typical animal cell is consumed in fueling the pump ( De Weer et al . , 1988 ) . Due to the 3 Na + / 2 K + stoichiometry of the sodium pump , the transport is electrogenic , but only generating around 10 % of total membrane potential in general . Because of the significance of NKA to cellular function , it is expected that its activity is precisely regulated in response to changes in the ionic environment . This can be achieved through short - term regulation of changing pump activity or long - term regulation of changing number of functioning units ( Ewart and Klip , 1995 ) . The long - term regulation is mediated via changes in gene expression and protein synthesis of new pumps which is usually accomplished within a period of hours . Short - term regulation is mediated by a number of factors such as substrate availability , hormones , and interaction with cytoskeletal proteins . This is achieved via modulation of kinetics of existing pumps or by changing its abundance at the cell surface through translocation of exiting units from an intracellular compartment . 1 . 3 . 1 Regulation of NKA through the phosphorylation of the α‐ subunit The NKA can be regulated through protein phosphorylation / dephosphorylation processes . The mechanisms involve the action of several kinases as depicted in Figure 2 . However , caution is required when integrating results obtained in a cell free system and in intact cells . 17 cAMP ‐ dependent protein kinase A possible common mechanism by which hormones modulate NKA activity is by regulating the phosphorylation state of the catalytic α - subunit . In the early 90’s , in vitro experiments have demonstrated that both cAMP - dependent kinase ( PKA ) and PKC can phosphorylate the purified α - subunit of NKA ( Lowndes et al . , 1990 ; Bertorello et al . , 1991 ) ; Chibalin et al . , 1992 ) . Large amount of evidence demonstrated that activation of cAMP - PKA stimulates the NKA activity by increasing its plasma membrane abundance ( Carranza et al . , 1996 ; Carranza et al . , 1998 ) . This stimulatory effect is mediated by PKA - phosphorylation of the NKA α - subunit which has the phosphorylation site mapped to the highly conserved Ser - 943 within the α 1 - subunit of NKA ( Figure 2 ) ( Fisone et al . , 1994 ) . cAMP as an important secondary messenger has PKA mediating most of its effects except some cAMP - gated channels in some tissues . The mammalian PKA is composed of a dimer of regulatory subunits and two monomeric catalytic subunits . It phosphorylates serine / threonine residues in proteins containing the consensus sequence Arg - Arg - X - Ser / Thr - X ( Kennelly and Krebs , 1991 ) . Each monomer of regulatory subunit contains two cyclic nucleotide - binding sites . The regulatory subunit also functions as autoinhibitory domain to bind to and inhibit the activity of the catalytic domains ( Soderling , 1990 ) . Upon to activation , the PKA dissociates into dimeric regulatory subunit and two active monomers of catalytic subunits . There are two major isoforms of mammalian regulatory subunits , regulatory type I and type II , which are coded by distinct genes but are highly homologous ( Francis and Corbin , 1994 ) . The catalytic subunit also has isoforms coded by distinct genes as α , β , γ . In some tissues , the activation of type II PKA is mediated by binding through its regulatory subunit to the A kinase anchoring protein which is sometimes the substrate of PKA ( Bregman et al . , 1989 ; Scott et al . , 1990 ) . Protein kinase C PKCs have been recognized as one of the key kinases mediating hormonal effects in the PCT cells . Interestingly , the phosphorylation sites of PKCs have been mapped to be within the N - terminus rather than the C - terminus of the NKA α 1 - subunit . ( Figure 2 ) Depending on the isoform , activation of PKCs by hormonal receptor signaling can either stimulate or inhibit the NKA activity by modulating its plasma membrane abundance . In OK cells , dopamine induced NKA endocytosis is initiated by PKC ζ phosphorylating Figure 2 Na + , K + - ATPase phosphorylation sites that have been described either in a cell free system in the presence of purified kinases , or in intact cell in response to diverse GPCR agonists . 18 Ser - 18 residue within its α 1 - subunit ( Chibalin et al . , 1999 ) whereas AT II induced NKA exocytosis is mediated by PKC - β phosphorylating both Ser - 11 and Ser - 18 residues ( Efendiev et al . , 2003 ) . Additionally , PKCs have an important role in regulating endocytosis in general ( Alvi et al . , 2007a ) . The PKCs are one of the crucial serine / threonine protein kinases , so named for it is Ca 2 + dependent ( Wolf et al . , 1985 ) . It is typically activated by diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , which is one hydrolysis product of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the other product is inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) . After phospholipase C - β / γ acting on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , an inositol phospholipid present in small amounts in the inner half of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer , the IP 3 reaches the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to bind to and open IP 3 - gated Ca 2 + - channels . The resulting rise in cytosolic Ca 2 + induces PKC to translocate from the cytosol to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane . There it is activated by the combination of Ca 2 + , diacylglycerol , and the negatively charged membrane phospholipids phosphatidylserine ( Parker and Murray - Rust , 2004 ; Stabel and Parker , 1991 ) . Once activated , PKC phosphorylates its target proteins depending on the cell type . At present there are totally 11 isotypes in PKC gene family ( α , β I , β II , γ , δ , ε , ζ , θ , ζ , ι / λ , and μ ) and can be grouped on the basis of a combination of structural and functional properties ( Dempsey et al . , 2000 ) . Most PKC isotypes display typical DAG or phorbol ester dependence for kinase activation , only the atypical isotypes ( aPKC ) are insentive and it has yet to be determined which if any lipids can activate the aPKC in vivo . Tyrosine kinases NKA has also been demonstrated to be under the control of tyrosine kinase . The phosphorylation site was mapped to Tyr - 5 within NKA α - subunit during insulin - induced NKA activation in the OK cells ( Feraille et al . , 1999 ) . In the protein kinase family , the great majorities are serine / threonine kinases while the others are tyrosine kinases . Of the 90 tyrosine kinase genes identified in human genome , 58 are receptor type and 32 are non - receptor tyrosine kinases ( Robinson et al . , 2000 ) . The human tyrosine kinases have a wide spectrum of protein domains from SH2 , SH3 , PH to multiple copies of immunoglobulin domains in the extracellular region of the receptors . The overall structures are similar between receptor and non - receptor kinases except the transmembrane segments . In general , they play roles in transcytoplasmic signaling pathways which is apparent function for the receptor family but also for the most of the non - receptor tyrosine kinases as they are coupled to , and essentially function as subunits of either receptor lacking intrinsic kinase activity or receptor tyrosine kinases . Cytokine receptors which commonly lack the kinase activity utilize non - receptor tyrosine kinase as essential signaling subunits ( Ihle , 1995 ) . Additionally , some tyrosine kinase receptors such as the receptor for platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , requires the recruitment and activation of Src kinases for cells to enter S phase and mitosis ( Superti - Furga and Courtneidge , 1995 ) . The use of non - 19 receptor tyrosine kinase as signaling subunits instead of covalently coupled kinase activity allows cell - specific signaling based on cell specific expression patterns . Moreover , use of soluble non - receptor kinases allows greater response diversity and facilitates crosstalk between different receptors by activating each other . It is also likely that non - receptor kinases are able to activate signaling pathways not accessible to receptor kinases . The function of non - receptor kinases are not restricted to direct signaling through receptor but also have transcriptional activity participating in nuclear events such as c - Abl with a DNA binding domain at the C - terminus ( Neet and Hunter , 1996 ) . Phosphatidylinositol 3 ‐ kinase Another kinase that has been shown to mediate hormonal receptor signaling in the regulation of NKA is the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3K ) . PI - 3K uses NKA as its binding partner rather than its phosphorylation substrate ( Figure 2 ) . During DA - induced NKA endocytosis in the kidney , PI - 3K associates with an NKA α 1 - subunit proline - rich motif via its SH3 domain within the p85 α subunit ( Yudowski et al . , 2000 ) . Apart from this , in other tissues such as vascular smooth muscle cells , it also requires PI - 3K in regulation of NKA by hormonal receptors ( Isenovic et al . , 2004 ) . PI - 3K principally phosphorylates inositol phospholipids rather than proteins ; it can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases , as well as by other types of cell - surface receptor like GPCR ( Downes and Carter , 1991 ; Fry , 1994 ; Stephens et al . , 1993 ) . PI - 3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of inositol phospholipids at the 3 position of the inositol ring to generate lipids called PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which can serve as docking sites for signaling proteins with pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain . PI - 3K class Ia consists of two subunits , the regulatory p85 α and the catalytic p110 α ( Hiles et al . , 1992 ; Otsu et al . , 1991 ) . P85 α has several modular domains including two SH2 domains which mediate protein - protein interaction by recognizing phosphotyrosine motif ( Songyang et al . , 1993 ) ; one SH3 domain which mediates protein - protein interaction by recognition of proline - rich sequence ( Pawson and Schlessingert , 1993 ; Yu et al . , 1994 ) ; two proline - rich motifs and helical region to interact with p110 α . P110 α also has several domains including the kinase domain and the p85 α binding domain . The heterotrimeric structure of PI - 3K suggests the possible model for its activation in the cell . Binding to phosphotyrosine motif via SH2 domain brings the catalytic subunit to its substrates which may be the crucial parameter for activation in vivo . PI - 3K also has several isotypes such as both p85 α and p110 α have related protein β and γ ( Hu et al . , 1993 ; Otsu et al . , 1991 ; Stoyanov et al . , 1995 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 NKA traffic to ‐ and from the plasma membrane The shuttling of NKA molecules from the plasma membrane to endosomes ( and the opposite ) has been demonstrated to be under the influence of many different signals , from hypoxia effects in the lung to hormonal effects in the kidney ( Figure 3 ) . In the 20 Figure 3 . CCV - mediated NKA traffic to and from the plasma membrane are under the control of multiple hormones . Activation of AT II and insulin receptors in the kidney as well as DA receptors in the lung stimulate NKA activity ( Blue arrow ) . Activation of DA and PTH receptors as well as hypoxia - induced mitochondria ROS in the lung inhibit NKA activity ( Red arrow ) . kidney , dopamine exerts its natriuretic effect in part by decreasing NKA activity ( Aperia et al . , 1987 ) . It removes active NKA molecules from the plasma membrane via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Chibalin et al . , 1997 ) which is initiated by PKC - δ dependent phosphorylation of a Ser - 18 residue within the α - subunit of NKA ( Chibalin et al . , 1999 ) . The phosphor - Ser - 18 residue favors the PI - 3K binding and activation which generates phospholipids at the endocytic site ( Yudowski et al . , 2000 ) . This leads to the recruitment of AP2 to interact with NKA α subunit at Y 537 LEL motif as well as bringing clathrin chain to form CCP ( Ogimoto et al . , 2000 ) . As the pit grows , dynamin is recruited to the neck of the pit via activation of phospholipase 2A ( PP2A ) ( Efendiev et al . , 2002 ) . Together with other proteins help , dynamin promotes the release of the CCP into CCVs . In contrast , AT II and insulin function as antinatriuretic hormones by partly increasing the NKA activity ( Feraille et al . , 1994 ; Garvin , 1991 ) . AT II recruits NKA from endosomes to the plasma membrane mediated by CCVs . This process is initiated by PKC - β dependent phosphorylation of both a Ser - 11 and a Ser - 18 residues within the α - subunit of NKA followed by AP1 recruitment ( Efendiev et al . , 2003 ) . Insulin also increases NKA activity in the renal proximal tubule by bringing more active molecules to the plasma membrane which is mediated by tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of NKA ( Feraille et al . , 1999 ) . In the lung alveolar epithelial cells hypoxia - induced endocytosis of NKA is also initiated by PKC - ζ phosphorylation of a Ser - 18 residue within the α - subunit of NKA ( Dada et al . , 2003 ) . This phosphorylation leads to the binding of AP2 to the α - subunit of NKA followed by CCV formation . In contrast to DA inhibitory effect on NKA in the kidney , activation of DA1r as well as β - adrenergic receptor ( β 2AR ) stimulates NKA activity by inserting active molecules into the plasma membrane and this stimulation effect is dependent on both PKC - δ and PKC - ε activation ( Ridge et al . , 2002 ) . Physiologically , such stimulation effect on NKA has been implicated in pulmonary fluid clearance in rats ( Azzam et al . , 2001 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 Physiological significance of NKA regulation The kidney has a major role in keeping the homeostasis of the extracellular compartment . This function of kidney requires the presence of numbers of specific carriers able to transport a large variety of substrates and their fine control by specific 21 factors and hormones . Functionally , a smallest unit in kidney is the nephron which is composed of glomerulus and the renal tubule . The capillary vessels in the glomerulus are actively involved in filtrating blood into the renal tubule which is responsible for generating the urine by reabsorption of a large variety of substrates . The renal tubule can be divided into several segments , the proximal tubule , loop of Henle , distal tubule , collecting duct . The proximal tubule is responsible for reabsorbing more than 70 % of sodium , potassium , chloride , bicarbonate , phosphate , and water and all the filtered glucose , amino acids . The bulk of sodium and water reabsorption by the proximal tubule is controlled positively mainly by AT II and epinephrine / norepinephrine and negatively by dopamine . The transport property of different segments in the proximal tubule is very similar even though the transport rates vary . The reabsorption of Na + and Cl - plays a major role in body electrolyte and water metabolism . Additionally , Na + transport is coupled to the movement of H + , other electrolytes , glucose , amino acids , organic acids , phosphate , and other substances across the tubule walls ( Feraille and Doucet , 2001 ) . Na + enters the cell down its concentration and electrical gradient mainly through Na + / H + exchanger located in the apical domain , then it is actively transported into interstitial space mainly by the NKA in the basolateral domain ( Schwartz et al . , 1974 ) . 1 . 4 INTRACELLULAR SCAFFOLDING PROTEINS Signals received at the cell surface by GPCR or enzyme - linked receptors are transferred into the cell via a combination of small and large intracellular signaling molecules . Even a single type of extracellular signal that acts through a single type of GPCR or enzyme - linked receptor usually activates multiple parallel signaling pathways and can thereby influence multiple aspects of cell behavior , such as shape , movement , metabolism , and gene expression . It is not clear how an individual cell manages to display specific responses to so many different extracellular signals . One strategy that the cell uses to achieve specificity involves scaffold proteins which locate functionally related proteins ( e . g . receptors , kinases , channels ) into close proximity to form a signal transduction complex . With such an organization signals can be transferred with precision , speed and efficiency , moreover , unwanted cross - talk between signaling pathway is avoided . 14 ‐ 3 ‐ 3 proteins Many signaling events are orchestrated by specific protein interactions mediated through phosphopeptide - binding motifs . Among all phosphopeptide - binding motifs now known , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are the first recognized to specifically bind a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif . Although they were first discovered and named according to their fraction number on the DEAE cellulose as early as in 1967 ( Moore and Perez , 1967 ) , the phosphopeptide binding property has not been recognized until 1996 ( Muslin et al . , 1996 ) . 22 The 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are small ( ~ 30 kDa ) , acidic proteins that form both homo - and heterodimers . They are a family of ubiquitously expressed , exclusively eukaryotic proteins with a wide range of binding partners . There are 7 isoforms identified in mammals which are all conserved ( Rosenquist et al . , 2001 ) , with about 50 % identity of amino acids both within and across species ( Bridges and Moorhead , 2005 ) . Only 14 - 3 - 3 σ is unique which prefers homodimerization and has 17 % overlap with the binding proteins identified by 14 - 3 - 3 ξ ( Benzinger et al . , 2005 ) . All isoforms have similar structure which is highly helical , and forms cup - shaped rigid dimers ( Liu et al . , 1995 ; Xiao et al . , 1995 ) . Each subunit of the dimer is able to bind one phosphoserine - or phosphothreonine - containing ligand independently ( Liu et al . , 1995 ; Obsil et al . , 2001 ; Rittinger et al . , 1999 ) . The phosphopeptide - binding pocket is the most conserved region both within and across species ( Bridges and Moorhead , 2005 ) . There are several generalized roles of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins binding to phosphopeptide ( Bridges and Moorhead , 2005 ; Fu et al . , 2000 ; Tzivion and Avruch , 2002 ) . First , cocrystallization studies of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins with peptide or whole proteins have shown little change in the structure of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein compared with ligand - free form , which indicates the highly stable 14 - 3 - 3’s conformation may function as support on which the target proteins can be reshaped such as stabilization of the enzyme’s active conformation ( Yaffe , 2002 ) . Another function is 14 - 3 - 3 proteins may act as masks to occlude important features of target proteins , in other words , when a 14 - 3 - 3 protein binds a target , it could block access of other possible interacting factors . The best example is 14 - 3 - 3’s shielding blocks phosphatase access to the phosphorylation site ( Margolis et al . , 2003 ) . The third function of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins is to act as a phosphorylation - dependent scaffold to anchor proteins within close proximity to each other ( Braselmann and McCormick , 1995 ) . Such as one - half of the dimer could bind to a protein kinase , while the other site binds to the kinase substrate ( Agarwal - Mawal et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , when a kinase activation signal is detected , the substrate is rapidly and specifically phosphorylated . Multiple PDZ domain proteins To assemble big signaling complexes , a variety of highly conserved small protein binding domains are used as building blocks . One most commonly used domain is PDZ which is named after the initials of the first three proteins in which PDZ domains were identified ( postsynaptic protein PSD - 95 ( Cho et al . , 1992 ) / SAP90 ( Kistner et al . , 1993 ) , Drosophila septate junction protein Discs - large ( Woods and Bryant , 1991 ) , tight junction protein Zo - 1 ( Willott et al . , 1993 ) . They are the most abundant protein interaction domains in metazoan organisms , widely spread from 92 proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans , 131 proteins in Drosophila melanogaster to more than 400 proteins in Homo sapiens . PDZ proteins can be classified into three families : The first family contains proteins consisting entirely of PDZ domains ; the second family is the MAGUKs ( membrane - associated guanylate kinases ) , which contain PDZ domains , one 23 SH3 domain , and guanylate kinase domain ( GuK ) ; the third family contains proteins with PDZ domains together with other protein domains ( Nourry et al . , 2003 ) . PDZ domains are usually 80 - 90 amino acids long comprising six β strands ( β A to β F ) and two α - helices , α A and α B , compacted in a globular structure ( Daniels et al . , 1998 ; Doyle et al . , 1996 ; Tochio et al . , 1999 ) . PDZ domains specifically interact with proteins with the last 4 - 5 short peptides at the C - terminus . The C - terminal peptide binding groove lies between β B and α B with the carboxylate - binding loop lies between the β A and β B strands , extending from a highly conserved arginine or lysine residue to the signature Gly - Leu - Gly - Phe ( GLGF ) motif . Therefore PDZ domains generally select peptide ligand with a hydrophobic C - terminal residue . The third last residue of the ligand is a particularly important determinant for PDZ binding and forms the basis for classification of the PDZ specificity : In class I it requires serine or threonine residue ( Songyang et al . , 1997 ) ; In class II it needs a hydrophobic residue which can be either tyrosine , valine , phenylalanine or isoleucine ( Songyang et al . , 1997 ) ; In class III it prefers an acidic residue such as aspartic acid ( Stricker et al . , 1997 ) ; However , in the newly characterized class IV it has no special preference for the third last residue but only the last residue to be acid as aspartic acid or glutamic acid ( Vaccaro et al . , 2001 ) . So far the most well studied example of scaffold protein is the Drosophila INAD ( inactivation - no - after potential ) which has 5 PDZ domains , and each of them binds to a component of the phototransduction cascade from TRP ( transient receptor potential , light - activated ion channel ) , PLC - β to PKC ( Tsunoda et al . , 1997 ) . A human homologue has been identified and named as h INAD which has 7 PDZ domains characterized ( Philipp and Flockerzi , 1997 ) and shares 73 % similarity at the amino acid level with mouse INAD ( m INAD ) and 26 % similarity with d INAD . Binding specificity of each h INAD PDZ domains have been well studied , PDZ domain 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 recognize class II ligands , domain 5 , 6 , and 7 recognize class I ligands while PDZ domain 3 also recognize novel class IV ( Vaccaro et al . , 2001 ) . 24 2 . AIMS The aim of this study is to examine the identity of new proteins and mechanisms participating in the regulation of NKA activity / trafficking in response to a variety of membrane receptors . Also , to compare whether common and / or unique signaling events participate in this process ( stimulation / inhibition = recruitment / endocytosis ) in order to understand how the signals can be integrated in time and space to ensure precision and avoid deleterious cross - talk . Specific questions that will help in the development of these aims : 1 . Are 14 - 3 - 3 proteins potential adaptors linking the phosphor - serine 18 residue within the Na + , K + - ATPase α subunit to the binding and activation of PI - 3K ( Figure 4A ) ? 2 . Are the receptor signals controlling the phosphorylation of AP2 μ 2 subunit during Na + , K + - ATPase endocytosis ( Figure 4A ) ? 3 . Is the scaffolding protein INAD organizing the receptor signals during Na + , K + - ATPase trafficking ( Figure 4B ) ?

METHODOLOGY Cell lines The OK cell line is an established epithelial cell line derived from the kidney of a North American opossum , and which retain various characteristics of proximal convoluted tubules ( Malstrom et al . , 1987 ) . These characteristics include Na + - coupled uptake mechanisms for amino acids and hexoses , expression of parathyroid hormone receptors , dopamine receptors , and AT II receptors , parathyroid hormone - regulated Na + and phosphate transport , and expression of E . coli enterotoxin receptors which have previously been shown within the OK cells to only be expressed on cells in the proximal tubule ( Forte et al . , 1988 ) ( Bates et al . , 1991 ) . It has been used as a physiological model system to study renal proximal tubule response to hormones ( Efendiev et al . , 2002 ) ( Khundmiri et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , this cell line has become an important in vitro model system for proximal tubular physiological studies . The A549 cell line was established in 1972 and has characteristic features of Type II cells of the pulmonary epithelium , including lamellar bodies ( Lieber et al . , 1976 ) . In the lung aveoli , the epithelial lining is the major barrier to protein movement into or out of it . The pulmonary epithelium is composed of two major cell types , Type I and Type II . Type I cells cover approximately 96 % of the surface area and are unable to divide . Type II cells , while covering less surface area of the alveolus , are more numerous and have distinct functions , such as their endocytic properties have been well characterized . The A549 cell line has been shown to have metabolic and transport properties consistent with Type II pulmonary epithelial cells in vivo ( Foster et al . , 1998 ) . Cell culture and transfection OK cells were maintained at 37°C ( 10 % CO 2 ) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % bovine serum ( GIBCOL , Invitrogen ) and Penicillin 100unit / ml - Streptomycin 100µg / ml . Plasmids were introduced into OK cells using liposomes ( LipofectAMINE 2000 , Invitrogen ) . For experiments with h INAD ( paper III ) , h INAD expression was monitored by confocal microscopy of the GFP tag used as reporter and by Western blot using a GFP - and h INAD antibody . The lower temperature ( 25 o C for at least 72 h ) of the culture conditions optimizes h INAD expression level and increased cell viability . Preparation of plasmids The cDNA for human INAD ( pcDNA2 . hINAD ) was kindly provided by Dr . V . Flockerzi ( Heidelberg , Germany ) ( Philipp and Flockerzi , 1997 ) . To obtain an expression construct for c - terminally GFP - tagged h INAD , we first changed nucleotides encoding Val1549 from G T T to G A T , thus creating a ClaI site , which allowed in - frame fusion with the cDNA of EGFP and generation of pcDNA2 . h INAD - GFP . Next we subcloned the human CMV promoter in front of the h INAD - GFP fusion gene , thus generating pcDNA2 . CMV . h INAD - GFP . Deletions of individual PDZ domains 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , or 6 , 26 respectively , were performed on pcDNA2 . CMV . h INAD - GFP by introducing a set of unique restriction sites into the cDNA 5’ and 3’ of the sequences encoding the respective domain . The unique set of restriction sites for each mutant was generated by exchanging nucleotides as follows : EheI for PDZ 1 ( Δ 130 - 217aa , GGC CGG versus GGC GCC , GTG GCC versus GGC GCC ) , BbrPI for PDZ 2 ( Δ 248 - 323aa , CA T GT T versus CA C GT G , C T CGT T versus C A CGT G ) , HpaI for PDZ 4 ( Δ 685 - 766aa , GT C AA G versus GT T AA C , GT AC AC versus GT TA AC ) , BlnI for PDZ 5 ( Δ 1068 - 1152aa , CC G AG A versus CC T AG G , CCT GT G versus CCT AG G ) , SalI for PDZ 6 ( Δ 1234 - 1315aa , G GA GA A versus G TC GA C , GTC A A G versus GTC G A C ) . All resulting mutant plasmids were then digested with the corresponding enzyme to delete the respective PDZ domain and ligated overnight using a T4 DNA ligase ( Boehringer , IN , ) and amplified by transformation in competent E . coli . Positive clones were selected by restriction enzyme analysis and deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing . All mutations were performed by employing the QuikChangeXL site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and respective oligonucleotides purchased from Proligo ( Paris , France ) . All vector constructions were verified by DNA sequence analysis . Determination of Na + , K + ‐ ATPase activity NKA activity was determined from the ouabain - inhibitable 86 Rb - transport ( Yudowski et al . , 2000 ) . Briefly , after 2 h incubation at 37°C with 10 mM EGTA the cells were transferred to serum - free DMEM containing 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 with or without 5 mM ouabain . Thereafter , a trace amount ( 1µCi / µl ) of 86 Rb ( Perkin - Elmer ) was added to the cell medium . After 20 min incubation at room temperature , the cells were washed with ice - cold saline and dissolved with 3 % SDS , and the accumulated radioactivity was determined by counting the β - radiation . Na + , K + - ATPase - mediated Rb + transport was calculated from the difference in tracer uptake between samples incubated with and without 5 mM ouabain . NKA activity was expressed as nmol of Rb + / mg protein / min from triplicate determinations . To assess the effect of DA , cells were pre - incubated at room temperature with 5 μ M monensin for 30 min ( Yudowski et al . , 2000 ) , and then with 1 μ M DA ( 5 min ) before the assays . To assess the effects of AT II and insulin , cells were incubated with 1pM AT II or 50nM insulin during the last 10 min of 86 Rb incubation . Confocal microscopy Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6 cm petri - dishes . After rinsing with phosphate - buffered saline , the coverslips were mounted ( SlowFade light ; Molecular Probes ) and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Leica TCS NT ; Leica Lasertechnik GmbH , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Excitation wavelengths of 488 nm for Oregon green and 568 nm for rhodamine were used . Expression of GFP tagged h INAD was evaluated by confocal microscopy exactly as described before . h INAD was detected by the intrinsic fluorescence of GFP using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Leica TCS SP2 , Leica Lasertechnik GmbH , Heidelberg , Germany ) . The 27 confocal microscope was equipped with an Ar / Kr laser and a double dicroic mirror and a 63x lens ( Leica HCX PL APO 63x / 1 . 20 - 0 . 17 , UV ) lens . Immunoprecipitation OK cells grown in 10 cm Petri - dish were washed with PBS and homogenized in 50 mM Mannitol , 5 mM HEPES - Tris buffer ( pH7 . 6 ) by freezing / thawing followed by vortexing , and by passing through 27 . 5 - G needle and motor pestle . The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove the nuclear fraction . The supernatants were further centrifuged at 25000 x g for 20 min to isolate the crude membrane fraction . Cell lysates or membranes were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM NaF , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10µg / ml Aprotinin , 1 mM PMSF , 5 µg / ml Pepstatin A , 5 µg / ml Leupeptin , 5 µg / ml Antipain ) . Aliquots of the supernatant ( ~ 400 μ g ) and / or membranes ( ~ 80 μ g ) were precleared with A / G agarose ( Amersham Biosciences AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) , and transferred to precoated ( with desired antibody ) ExactaCruz beads and incubated overnight . The beads were washed with 150 mM NaCl , and samples analyzed by SDS - PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system ( Laemmli , 1970 ) , and Western blot was performed using specific antibodies . Protein were detected by chemiluminescence ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala ) and quantitated by scanning followed by Image - J analysis . Scans were performed using a Scan Jet IIc scanner ( Hewlett Packard , Palo Alto , CA ) . Each band was scanned two times in different regions , the scans were averaged , and the area of the peak minus the background ( in arbitrary units ) . Cell surface biotinylation Transiently transfected cells after 24 h were transferred to Hanks ' solution for 30 min and then incubated for 5 min with 1 µM DA or vehicle at room temp . Incubation was stopped on ice , and the medium was changed to ice - cold 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mg / ml sulfo - N - hydroxysuccinimidobiotin , the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C . Following biotin labeling , the cells were scraped into immunoprecipitation buffer ( 20 mM Tris , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM EGTA , 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate , pH 7 . 3 ) containing a protease inhibitor mixture , homogenized by passing through 27 . 5 - G needle for 20 times and motor pestle 5 s for 30 strokes . The cell suspension was centrifuged at 800 x g at 4 °C for 10 min . Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes , and 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 2 % SDS were added . Anti - α 1 monoclonal antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with end - over - end rotating and then 40 μ l protein A / G - agarose ( Santa Cruz ) for 2 h at 4°C with end - over - end rotating , pre - washed three times with PBS and once with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , was added and incubated overnight . The pellet was washed three times with this buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 1 % SDS , once with 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer . Electrophoresis , Western blot using extravidin , and densitometric analysis were performed as described previously . 28 Determination of PI ‐ 3K Activity After preincubation with DA under different conditions , the cells were transferred to 1 . 5 - ml Eppendorff tubes in the cold , homogenized in 400 µl of lysis buffer ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % v / v glycerol , 20 mM Tris - HCl , 10 µg / ml leupeptin , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 10 mM NaF , 10 mg / ml aprotinin ) and solubilized by passing through needles and by stroking with a motor - pestle for 30 s . After centrifugation at 800 x g for 10 min , the supernatant was collected , and 500 µg of protein ( in 1 ml ) was incubated with an antibody against the NKA α - subunit ( gift of Dr . R . Mercer and G . Blanco , Washington University , St . Louis , MO ) by end - over - end rotating overnight . The next morning , 40 µl of protein A / G - agarose beads ( Pharmacia Corp . ) were added and incubated for 2 h by end - over - end rotating . The immune complex was washed three times with lysis buffer , two times with washing buffer 2 ( 137 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , 10 µg / ml leupeptin , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 10 mM NaF , 10 mg / ml aprotinin ) , once with washing buffer 3 ( 0 . 15 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris - HCl , 10 µg / ml leupeptin , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 10 mM NaF , 10 mg / ml aprotinin ) , once with washing buffer 4 ( 20 mM Hepes , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 µg / ml leupeptin , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 10 mM NaF , 10 mg / ml aprotinin ) , and then resuspended in 20 µl of kinase assay buffer ( 20 mM β - glycerophosphate , 5 mM Na - pyrophosphate , 30 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) . The PI - 3K activity in the immunoprecipitate was assessed directly on the protein A / G - agarose beads as described previously ( Krook et al . , 1997 ) . The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 µl of reaction mixture ( 20 µl of buffer ( 12 . 5 µM ATP , 7 . 6 mM MgCl 2 , 20mM β - glycerophosphate , 5 mM Na - pyrophosphate , 30 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 4 µCi [ γ - 32 P ] ATP ) plus 40 µg of lipids ( Avanti Biochemicals , Birmingham , AL ) in 10 µl of cholate buffer ( 10 mg sodium cholate / 1 ml kinase assay buffer ) . The pellets were incubated for 15 min at room temperature , and the reaction was terminated by the sequential addition of 20 µl of HCl and 160 µl of chloroform / methanol ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) with vigorous vortexing . After centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 5 min , 80 µl of the lower phase was spotted on aluminum - backed silica gel thin layer chromatography plates ( Merck ) . The lipids were resolved by chromatography in methanol / CHCl 3 / ammonia / H 2 O ( 47 : 34 : 12 . 5 : 6 . 5 ) . The dot corresponding to phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate was analyzed by autoradiography and quantitated using phosphorimaging . 29 4 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results from these studies revealed the identity of a new protein ( 14 - 3 - 3 ) whose involvement is critical during the endocytic process of the NKA in response to dopamine signals . In addition , initiation of NKA endocytosis requires the phosphorylation of adaptor protein - 2 . The latter also occurs in lung cells and in response to elevations in reactive oxygen species , indicating that the signaling mediating NKA endocytosis is similar in nature ( similar in renal as well as in lung epithelial cells ) , and it can be triggered by different agonists in a cell specific manner . INAD appears to integrate the cellular responses ( signaling molecules organization ) during regulation of NKA activity / trafficking . Interestingly , different PDZ domains within INAD are involved depending of whether the signals trigger inhibition ( endocytosis ) or stimulation ( recruitment ) of NKA . 14 ‐ 3 ‐ 3 proteins link phosphorylation and binding of PI ‐ 3Kinase during NKA endocytosis in response to DA ( paper I ) As it was recognized decades ago that the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins have wide distribution , our study confirmed the expression of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in rat proximal tubule as well as in the OK cells . By using western blot analysis and confocal microscopy with an antibody against the N - terminus of the β - isoform , the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins appeared to be mostly cytosolic with a negligible amount associated with the basolateral membrane fraction . However , the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins’ presence in the basolateral membrane was induced in response to dopamine treatment at the peak of 2 min which is within the time frame of the initial stage of CCP formation . This is consistent with the previous study demonstrating that the phosphorylation of NKA α - subunit as the initial signal of its endocytosis peaked at 2 . 5 min ( Chibalin et al . , 1998 ) , which leads us to further examine 14 - 3 - 3 proteins’ role during DA - induced endocytosis of NKA . The first question was whether 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are in the signaling complex leading to NKA endocytosis , induced by DA , and if it is phosphorylation dependent . We used the co - immunoprecipitation to analyze the interaction between 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and NKA and found both of them co - immunoprecipitated with each other after 2 min DA treatment . Furthermore , by expressing a rat isoform of NKA α - subunit lacking the phosphorylation site ( alanine substitute’s serine 18 residue ) this blocked the DA increased association between 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and NKA . Thus , the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins were recruited to bind to the α - subunit of NKA at phosphor - serine 18 residues upon to the DA treatment . Since 14 - 3 - 3 proteins only function as dimers and only one phosphorylation site identified within the N - terminus of the α - subunit , it is not likely that a 14 - 3 - 3 dimer would bring two phosphorylated NKA α - subunits into close proximity but rather to function as a scaffold colocalizing NKA α subunit with a third binding partner , which can possibly be PI - 3K . It has been shown in other cell systems that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins bind to PI - 3K with physiological consequences ( Guthridge et al . , 30 2000 ) and the DA stimulated NKA endocytosis requires PI - 3K activation and association with NKA α subunits via proline - rich motif within the N - terminus upstream of serine 18 residue . Again we used co - immunoprecipitation and found that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and PI3K interact with each other . This interaction was increased in response to DA and can be blocked by introducing a 14 - 3 - 3 dominant - negative mutant of isoform ε . Because the increase of PI - 3K activity in response to DA was also blocked by expressing the DN 14 - 3 - 3 ε mutant , we conclude that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins function as critical signaling partners during DA - induced NKA endocytosis by shielding the phosphor - serine 18 residue of the α - subunit with one subunit of the dimer while bringing PI - 3K to the endocytic site via the other . However , the constitutive association between 14 - 3 - 3 and NKA were observed even at the absence of first 26 amino acids within the N - terminus of NKA which indicates there is more than one interaction site within NKA for 14 - 3 - 3 which can be phosphor - serine independent ( Masters et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , PI - 3K also constitutively associated with NKA and this interaction appeared to be functional as there was basal PI - 3K activity co - immunoprecipitated with NKA . Thus we assume that during the DA - induced NKA endocytosis interactions between 14 - 3 - 3 , NKA , and PI - 3K are ligand - dependent which then incorporate the constitutive endocytic machinery . It is likely that the 14 - 3 - 3 ε and β isoforms heterodimerize during this process as the dominant - negative ( DN ) 14 - 3 - 3 ε mutant and antibody against 14 - 3 - 3 β were used . Interestingly , this possible isoform combination was recently confirmed by another study ( Kimura et al . , 2007 ) which showed the 14 - 3 - 3 ε but not the ζ isoform bound to NKA in COS cells despite the fact that all 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms are highly conserved with amino acid sequence similarity about 50 % . Therefore , the specific 14 - 3 - 3 isoform combination in different cell systems appears to be one way of controlling the signaling specificity and this specificity is possibly lying in the C - terminus of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins which has more flexibility in changing conformation upon to ligand - binding and is less conserved ( Silhan et al . , 2004 ) . We have not investigated how 14 - 3 - 3 interacts with PI - 3K , i . e . with either the p110 or p85 subunit , mediating this effect and through what binding motif . But it has been demonstrated that the catalytic p110 directly interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 τ in vitro ( Bonnefoy - Berard et al . , 1995 ) which indicates that 14 - 3 - 3 ε / β dimer not only brings PI - 3K into close proximity to the NKA but also possibly plays an allosteric regulatory role by stabilizing the catalytic subunit p110 in its active conformation . The binding of 14 - 3 - 3 ε / β to the phosphor - ser 18 residue within the α - subunit may function as a shield to protect the phosphate group from phosphatase . Phosphorylation of AP2 μ 2 in response to DA signals promote its binding to the NKA α‐ subunit during endocytosis ( paper II ) Clathrin - mediated endocytosis of NKA molecules in response to GPCR signaling is mediated by AP2 . The AP2 binding site was mapped to the Y 537 LEL motif within the α subunit ATP - binding domain ( Done et al . , 2002 ; Hilge et al . , 2003 ) . 31 All APs bind to tyrosine - based motifs and in AP2 it has been structurally resolved that this interaction is through the C - terminal domain of μ 2 subunit ( Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . The μ 2 subunit is of medium size around 50kDa and structurally consists of a larger 30 kDa C - domain with a N - domain connected by a 24 amino acids ( aa 135 - 158 ) highly mobile linker , together with α , β 2 , and σ 2 to form the 200 kDa AP2 core ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . The N - μ 2 and σ 2 are structurally identical with a main role in stabilizing the core of the tetrameric complex whereas the C - µ2 contains the tyrosin - motif and the phosphoinositides binding sites as well as cross links two trunk domains . In the inactive form , the tyrosine - motif binding site is blocked by portions of the β 2 subunit which indicates there is a conformational transformation needed . Indeed , it has been demonstrated in cell - free systems and in intact cells that AP - 2 undergoes phosphorylation in its µ2 subunit and that this effect is required for cargo recognition during transferrin receptor endocytosis ( Olusanya et al . , 2001 ) . This phosphorylation site has been characterised to be threonine 156 within the linker ( Pauloin and Thurieau , 1993 ) and can be phosphorylated by adaptor - associated kinase ( AAK ) ( Conner and Schmid , 2002b ) and / or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . In our study AP - 2 ( µ2 subunit ) phosphorylation in OK cells increased in a time - dependent manner in response to DA with a peak at 2 min . By introducing the µ2 mutant with threonine 156 residue substituted by alanine ( T156A ) in OK cells , the DA effect of reducing NKA membrane surface abundance was blocked , which partly abolished the DA inhibition of NKA activity . Similarly , the µ2 - T156A mutant also blocked hypoxia - as well as hydrogen peroxide induced NKA endocytosis in A549 cells . It has been previously demonstrated that hypoxia stimulates NKA endocytosis with similar initial molecular mechanism by activating PKC - ζ phosphorylating Ser - 18 within the N - terminus of NKA . This hypoxia - induced PKC - ζ - mediated phosphorylation has been further demonstrated to be mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ( Dada et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , the requirement of μ 2 threonine phosphorylation further demonstrated that the physiological stimulus in the renal tubule and the pathological stimulus in the alveolar epithelia share highly similar molecular signaling events leading to the same consequence of NKA endocytosis . By using several protein kinase inhibitors , we made an effort to identify the kinase responsible for the µ2 phosphorylation . In the presence of a cAMP - dependent kinase inhibitor ( Rp - cAMP ) , DA efficiently stimulated µ2 phosphorylation whereas 1 µM bisindolylmaleimide blocked this stimulation effect . Since 1 µM bisindolylmaleimide can inhibit PKC - ζ , another PKC inhibitor staurosporine was also tested . At the concentration of 10 nM , the DA - stimulation effect of µ2 phosphorylation was blocked whereas at the concentration of 60 nM staurosporine µ2 phosphorylation was almost completely eliminated compared to the basal level . Expressing a DN PKC - ζ , mutant in the OK cells blocked DA - stimulated µ2 phosphorylation in a similar fashion . However , one has to consider the fact that PKC - 32 ζ , phosphorylation of Ser - 18 within NKA α - subunit is within the initial event of DA - induced NKA endocytosis , which can be an upstream signal to the µ2 phosphorylation even though the possibility of PKC - ζ , simultaneously phosphorylating AP2 µ2 and NKA α - subunit does exit . Furthermore , 10 nM staurosporine is not effective on PKC - ζ but only on the other PKC isoforms . So it appears to be a kinase other than PKC - ζ that is mediating this effect . It has been reported that an adaptor - associated kinase ( AAK1 ) directly binds the ear domain of α - adaptin in vivo and in vitro ( Conner and Schmid , 2002 ) which specifically phosphorylates µ2 at threonine 156 ( Pauloin and Thurieau , 1993 ; Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) , and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that staurosporine at concentrations within the nM range also inhibits AAK1 ( Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) . Due to the lack of AAK1 - specific inhibitors and specific dominant - negative modulators , we can not further analyse the AAK1 function in this process . A third kinase GAK shall also be mentioned which is capable of phosphorylating µ2 in vitro ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . But this effect is more likely to be involved during clathrin - coat disassembly because GAK , also named as auxilin2 which is the ubiquitous isoform of neuronal specific auxilin1 with an established role in releasing the clathrin - coat , is recruited after dynamin polymerization ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , PP2A has been recently characterised as the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of μ 2 as well as μ 1 of AP1 ( Ricotta et al . , 2008 ) . Cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are emerging to be recognized as important signals for controlling endocytic machinery . As major components of CCV , both clathrin and AP2 are phosphorylation activated and three subunits of AP2 have been shown to undergo phosphorylation , with μ 2 having the shortest half - life around 1 min . The importance of μ 2 phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle has also been investigated in our model in which the cytoskeleton protein adducin was characterised as a key protein linking PP2A with the components of NKA endocytic machinery ( Efendiev et al . , 2004 ) . Taken together , it is likely that μ 2 phosphorylation is mediated by AAK1 which triggers its binding to the cargo via YXX Ф motif followed by rapidly dephosphorylation by PP2A and this raises possibility for GAK to act during the clathrin - coat disassembly . h INAD organizes GPCR signals during NKA trafficking ( paper III ) Expression pattern The DA signaling network regulating NKA activity has been extensively studied and characterized in OK cells ( Pedemonte et al . , 2005 ) . The short isoform of mouse INAD ( m INAD ) was originally called channel interacting protein ( CIPP ) which was identified as a multi - PDZ domain protein exclusively present in the brain and kidney ( Kurschner et al . , 1998 ) . Later on the full length m INAD was discovered during the full length cDNA project and recognized as a homologue to h INAD and dINAD with 73 % and 26 % similarity at amino acid level , respectively . However , despite the high 33 sequence similarity between h INAD and m INAD , by using an antibody against hINAD we only detected its expression in the rat proximal tubule cells but not in the OK cells . But using an antibody against d INAD we immunostained OK cells . Among five isoforms of m INAD , isoforms 3 and 4 are truncated versions starting from amino acid 1222 which is the region that shares similarity with d INAD . Thus , OK cells may express a short INAD homolog similar to m INAD isoform 3 or 4 which can only be recognized by a d INAD but not a h INAD antibody , since the epitope of h INAD antibody lies between 600 - 800 aa whereas the epitope of d INAD antibody is between 1300 - 1600 aa . Expressing GFP - tagged h INAD constructs in the OK cells generated three proteins detected by both anti - h INAD and anti - GFP antibodies : the 230 kDa protein represents the full length h INAD whereas the 200 kDa and 135 kDa proteins are likely the products of alternative translation initiation sites . Similar expression patterns have been demonstrated previously in HeLa and Caco - 2 cells which has one more isoform around 75 kDa detected in Caco - 2 cells ( Lemmers et al . , 2002 ) . Alternative splicing of PDZ proteins has been considered as one way to achieve functional diversity and complexity ( Sierralta and Mendoza , 2004 ) . Different isoforms can be expressed in different tissues and in different subcellular locations thereby participating in diverse cellular events . For example two isoforms coded by pyd gene in Drosophila with one present in the adherens junction and the other in the basolateral domain in the epithelia ( Wei and Ellis , 2001 ) whereas the mouse atypical MAGUK magi - 1 has three isoforms with one predominantly located in the nucleus and the other two in the nonnuclear fractions ( Dobrosotskaya et al . , 1997 ) . In the case of m INAD , the isoforms expressed in kidney and brain have distinct sizes with the kidney isoform almost twice bigger than the brain isoform which strongly indicates specific tissue expression pattern for each isoform . In our study , the full - length h INAD was expressed at the highest level when compared to the other two isoforms and similarly distributed between the cytosol and membrane compartments , but the 200 kDa and 135 kDa were much less expressed in the Figure 5 . Summary of deletion mutants . PDZ domain 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 were removed and introduced a unique enzyme restriction site was created instead . All constructs are tagged with GFP ( indicated with black arrows at the end ) . 34 membrane compartments compared to the cytosol and none of them were expressed in the nucleus . To study the functional relevance of h INAD during DA - dependent regulation of Na + , K + - ATPase activity we generated h INAD mutants in which individual PDZ domains have been removed ( Figure 5 ) . Binding specificity of each h INAD PDZ domains have been well studied , PDZ domain 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 recognize class II ligands , domain 5 , 6 , and 7 recognize class I ligands while PDZ domain 3 also recognize novel class IV ( Vaccaro et al . , 2001 ) . We have chosen domain 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 as examples for each class and named each constructs as Del 1 , Del 2 , Del 4 , Del 5 , and Del 6 . Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis using antibodies against GFP and h INAD ( epitope conserved in all deletion mutants ) confirmed their successful expression in OK cells . The 230 kDa protein is present in all constructs where it can be observed obvious mobility shifts between the h INAD wild type ( WT ) and the deletion mutants due to the removal of each PDZ domain . The 200 kDa isoform is expressed by all constructs except Del 2 . This could be due to an alternative translation start site within PDZ 2 ( possibly Met 304 ) that was removed in Del 2 , the similar expression pattern of 200 kDa bands in WT and Del 1 also confirmed this assumption . The 135 kDa protein is also present in all constructs and the shift in Del 4 is probably due to the alternative translation initiation site which might be Met 853 before PDZ 4 . Functional Studies The interactions of h INAD with potential signaling partners of the DA signaling cascade were further analyzed in OK cells expressing h INAD - GFP . h INAD co - immunoprecipitated with the NKA α - subunit at both basal ( non - stimulating ) and DA - stimulated conditions , whereas it only co - immunoprecipitated with the DA1r upon DA treatment . The interaction between h INAD and NKA was further studied in OK cells transfected with each deletion mutants . Both h INAD WT and all deletion mutants together with three isoforms co - immunoprecipitated with NKA which suggests PDZ ligand within NKA signaling complex is capable of interacting with more than one PDZ domain of h INAD . The fact that the full length h INAD is always the mostly co - immunnoprecipitated isoform of both WT and all deletion mutants further indicates this property . Additionally , h INAD constitutively associated with the p85 α subunit of PI - 3Kinase , the PKC - ζ and the PLC - γ 1 isoform . To understand whether and how these interactions can be mediated by PDZ - ligands , we analyzed C - terminus sequence of each signaling partner interacted with h INAD . The NKA α - subunit does not have a classical PDZ ligand at the C - terminus ; neither does the β - nor the γ - subunit . According to the newly resolved crystal structure of NKA , the C - terminus of α - subunit strikingly points toward and forms interactions with the transmembrane segments to modulate the Na + binding affinity instead of being exposed in the cytosol ( Morth et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore it is likely an internal PDZ ligand is present in the NKA α - subunit , but the possibility of having a third protein constitutively associated with a PDZ ligand can not be excluded . On the other hand , while the PKC - ζ has a typical class III ligand , the DA1r , the p85 α 35 subunit of PI - 3Kinase , and the PLC γ 1 all contain potential internal PDZ ligand . There are several well studied examples of internal ligands mediating PDZ interactions such as the recently characterized PDZ ligand buried in distal C - terminus of endothelin receptor A ( Paasche et al . , 2005 ) . These authors have also suggested potential internal PDZ ligand within distal C - terminus of 35 GPCRs including AT II receptor subtype 1 . The best understood example of internal PDZ ligand is the interaction between neuronal nitric - oxide synthesis ( nNOS ) and PSD - 95 or syntrophin . Crystal - structural study revealed such interactions are mediated by the β - finger hairpin structure with critical amino acid sequence located on the tip of the β - turn mimicking the classical carboxylate dependent PDZ ligands ( Harris et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , h INAD is potentially capable of linking a variety of different types of signaling proteins ranging from receptors , effectors to transporters into a macromolecular complex . To understand the role of h INAD during NKA trafficking we next examined whether introducing h INAD and its deletion mutants alters the membrane properties of NKA including both the expression and the activity . The presence of various h INAD mutants did not affect the total expression of NKA α - subunit nor DA1r levels in OK cells . Also , the NKA activity was not significantly affected by the presence of h INAD mutants but there were slight reduction of NKA activity in cells transfected with Del 2 and Del 4 . Monensin stimulated NKA catalytic activity in cells expressing all deletion mutants with a slightly higher stimulation in Del 5 . Addition of PDZ interactions in several studies have demonstrated an increase in the channel opening probability such as introducing both PDZ domain - containing - protein 1 PDZK1 and NHERF increased Cl - current of CFTR by linking multiple cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR together ( Raghuram et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , PDZK1 interaction also increased phosphate transport by Na + - P i cotransporter II a Npt2 ( Custer et al . , 1997 ) and the short isoform of mINAD interaction stimulated K + current in inward rectifier K + ( Kir4 . 1 ) channel transfected in COS cells ( Kurschner et al . , 1998 ) . But none of them belongs to P - type transporter family which can possibly explain the minor effect of h INAD on NKA properties as there are essential structure differences between P - type transporters and channels . Besides , C - terminus of NKA α subunit intrudes into and interacts with the transmembrane segments so it is less likely that the PDZ ligand of NKA has a similar function of direct modulating transporting capacity . We next studied whether h INAD mediates the changes in NKA activity in response to DA signals . DA decreased proportionally ( ~ 30 % inhibition ) the NKA activity in mock and in cells transfected with the h INAD WT , Del 1 and Del 6 mutants , whereas this effect was impaired in cells expressing the Del 2 , Del 4 and Del 5 mutants . These results demonstrated that h INAD is of functional relevance during DA - dependent regulation of NKA activity . 36 h INAD IP : hINAD ATII - 1r NT h I N A D NT h I N A D - cells W T D e l . 1 D e l . 2 D e l . 4 D e l . 5 D e l . 6 AT1r Ins P C T A B In OK cells , both insulin and AT II stimulate NKA activity by inserting more active molecules to the plasma membrane . During sequence analysis a potential class IV PDZ ligand of AT1r was revealed at the C - terminal sequence of – E - V - E 0 which was also demonstrated by co - immunoprecipitation studies ( Figure 6A ) . However the consensus C - terminal sequence of insulin receptor ( - N - P - S 0 ) does not fall into any class of typical PDZ ligand , but the fact that insulin receptor substrate ( IRS - 1 ) possesses ( - S - T - V 0 ) a class one PDZ ligand ( Hori et al . , 2003 ) suggest PDZ interactions can be relevant during insulin signaling . Again , we examined h INAD WT and deletion mutants’ effects on the expression patterns of AT1r and insulin receptors . Total cell expression of AT1r and insulin receptor was similar between cells expressing hINAD WT and deletion mutants ( Figure 6B ) . The stimulatory effects by insulin and AT II on NKA appeared to be similar with around 40 % increase in WT and Del 2 transfected OK cells whereas this effect was reduced in Del 6 but almost blocked in Del 1 , Del 4 and Del 5 transfected cells ( Figure 7 ) . The differences in the stimulatory effects between WT and each deletion mutant have been statistically compared which were significant between WT and Del 1 , Del 4 and Del 5 transfected samples . The basal activities of NKA in each mutant transfected cells were summarized in Figure 7A . Interestingly , consistent with the basal activities in the DA study , NKA activity in the Del 2 transfected cell had lower activity than the rest which indicates that PDZ domain 2 of h INAD may potentially facilitate NKA membrane retention . Further , both insulin and AT II stimulated NKA activity in Del 2 transfected sample with a bigger magnitude than W T D e l . 1 D e l . 2 D e l . 4 D e l . 5 D e l . 6 0 1 2 3 4 N a , K - A T P a s e a c t i v i t y ( n m o l R b / m g p / m i n ) A B C W T - A T II D e l . 1 - A T II D e l . 2 - A T II D e l . 4 - A T II D e l . 5 - A T II D e l . 6 - A T II - 25 0 25 50 75 N a , K - A T P a s e a c t i v i t y ( % c hange ) W T - I n s D e l . 1 - I n s D e l . 2 - I n s D e l . 4 - I n s D e l . 5 - I n s D e l . 6 - I n s - 25 0 25 50 75 N a , K - A T P a s e a c t i v i t y ( % c hange ) Figure 7 .

( A ) h INAD co - immunoprecipitation with AT1r . ( B ) IR and AT1r total expression in cells transfected with h INAD WT and deletion mutants . 37 Figure 8 . Summary of each PDZ domains relevant for either DA inhibiting NKA activity or ATII / Insulin stimulating NKA activity due to the slightly higher expression level of AT1a in the absence of PDZ 2 within h INAD . Second , notably there is only Del 2 mutant lacking the 200 kDa isoform which may indicate that this isoform is of particular relevance during the NKA recruitment to the plasma membrane in response to AT II and insulin . In summary , h INAD as a multi - PDZ domain protein is of functional relevance during receptor - mediated NKA trafficking and these effects are mediated by different sets of PDZ domains within h INAD . During the DA - induced NKA inhibition there are PDZ domains 2 , 4 , 5 relevant while PDZ domain 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 are involved in AT II and insulin - induced NKA activation ( Figure 8 ) . Alternatively , the complex expression pattern of h INAD suggests that different isoform together with different PDZ ( inhibition ) Na + , K + ‐ ATPase ( stimulation ) PDZ1 PDZ2 PDZ4 PDZ5 PDZ6 PDZ4 PDZ5 ( INAD ) dopamine ATII / Ins domains could be responsible for organizing signaling on NKA trafficking to - and from the plasma membrane . Because not only the full length h INAD associated with membrane fraction at the most but also only in Del 2 transfected sample , lacking the 200 kDa isoform , both insulin and AT II stimulated NKA activity at a higher magnitude . This prompt us to think that perhaps the signal from AT II and insulin to stimulate NKA recycling is initiated at different subcellular location , like the endosome membrane , other than the plasma membrane which is more likely to be the site for signal from DA . Multiple membrane transporters have PDZ ligands buried in the C - terminus . In renal epithelial cells , this group range from Na + / H + exchanger type 3 ( NHE3 ) , Npt2 , CFTR in the apical domain to strong inward rectifier K + channel ( Kir2 . 3 ) and epithelial γ - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) transporter in the basolateral domain ( Brone and Eggermont , 2005 ) . Our study for the first time showed that NKA has a potential PDZ ligand other than the C - terminus which adds a P - type transporter into this family . It is generally accepted that PDZ interactions are dispensable for biosynthetic protein sorting but rather relevant for membrane protein retention . In the NHERF - 1 deficient mice , the basal NHE3 activity was normal but cAMP failed to inhibit its activity ( Weinman et al . , 2003 ) whereas Npt2 lost its proper apical expression and increasingly accumulated in intracellular organelles ( Shenolikar et al . , 2002 ) . In the PDZK1 knockout mice , the drug transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP1 ) has deficient basolateral expression in hepatocytes ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . These findings support that the function of PDZ interactions is cell specific as well as transporter specific . 38 5 . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS NKA as a house - keeping transporter has a central role in maintaining electrolyte and fluid balance in the body which has been well established for decades to be under the control of a variety of hormones ( Feraille and Doucet , 2001 ) . Hormones through their receptors exert stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the NKA activity by either modulating its traffic at the protein level or regulating its expression at the genetic level . However , how the signals from the hormonal receptors can be translated into internalization or recruitment of NKA within a short time frame remains incompletely understood . By studying the molecular mechanisms of NKA traffic in response to the hormones , this thesis intends to shed light on the fundamental cell biology question about how the signals derived from cell - surface receptors can be organized to ensure the efficient translation into the traffic of specific membrane proteins . Cell signaling and endocytosis are emerging to become one integrated and highly active field ( Polo and Di Fiore , 2006 ; Sorkin and Von Zastrow , 2002 ; von Zastrow and Sorkin , 2007 ) . Binding of hormones to the cell - surface receptors triggers an array of signal - transduction events leading to cellular effects such as proliferation , migration or cell fate determination . Activated receptors will in turn accelerate their own endocytosis , but also generate signals to modulate other membrane proteins traffic . One strong candidate of this type of signals is mediated by protein kinases which have been genome widely analysed and demonstrated that more than one third of the human kinases are involved in trafficking ( Pelkmans et al . , 2005 ) . In our model , the initiation of NKA traffic to - and from the plasma membrane has been demonstrated to be under the control of a variety of PKC isoforms . In OK cells , PKC - ζ is activated upon DA treatment at high intracellular Na + concentration of 19 mM to induce NKA endocytosis while PKC - β is activated in response to AT II or phorbol esters at normal intracellular Na + concentration of 9 mM to induce NKA exocytosis . On the other hand , in alveolar epithelia cells , DA stimulates NKA exocytosis instead by activating both PKC - ε and PKC - δ whereas the inhibition of NKA by endocytosis in response to hypoxia is dependent on PKC - ζ . Interestingly , PKC functioning as a general regulator of membrane trafficking has been proposed as it regulates a variety of effectors ranging from receptors to transporters ( Alvi et al . , 2007b ) . In OK cells , DA - stimulated PKC - ζ activation is followed by increased PI - 3K activity . In paper I , we identified a mechanism connecting the activation of these two kinases which are both required for DA - induced NKA endocytosis . Upon to DA treatment , 14 - 3 - 3 β / ε is recruited to phosphor - serine 18 motif which not only protects it to avoid the action of phosphatases but also binds to - and facilitates the activation of PI - 3K which then generates PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 for recruiting subsequent components of endocytic machinery which includes AP2 . The μ 2 subunit of AP2 interacts with NKA through Y 537 LEL motif located within the ATP - binding domain . This interaction is likely under the control of AAK1 , an AP2 α - adaptin associated kinase , which phosphorylates μ 2 subunit at Thr156 ( paper II ) possibly followed by subsequent dephosphorylation by PP2A . 39 This phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle has an important role during CCV formation because it not only happens to the μ 2 subunit but also to the phospholipids as AP2 appendages of α and β subunits can associate with several lipid - modifying kinases . As clathrin starts to polymerize and pit grows , the GTPase dynamin , responsible for scission , is recruited to the site and activated by dephosphorylation , which then self - assembles into a ring around the neck of CCP . By using the energy derived from dynamin GTP - hydrolysis as well as the assistance of actin polymerization CCP finally pinch off from the plasma membrane . Interestingly , as we have already discussed previously , the DA - induced NKA endocytosis in renal tubule appears to be rather cell - specific because in the airway epithelia DA stimulates NKA exocytosis instead . However , in the A549 cells hypoxia - induced mitochondria - derived ROS inhibits NKA activity in a similar fashion to renal DA which is also PKC - ζ mediated . In paper II , we further explored this possibility of sharing similar signaling pathway of NKA endocytosis in response to different stimuli by examining the phosphorylation of μ 2 subunit regulating its affinity to the cargo NKA . Indeed , by substitution of the Tyr - 537 within NKA α subunit both exposing to hypoxic condition and hydrogen peroxide treatment failed to stimulate NKA endocytosis , which indicates the NKA endocytosis by hypoxia is also mediated by CCV and AP2 . Furthermore , by blocking the μ 2 phosphorylation site at Thr - 156 , neither hypoxic condition nor hydrogen peroxide can induce NKA endocytosis . Thus , this study confirmed that a common signaling pathway regulating NKA endocytosis is shared by a physiologic stimulus DA and a pathologic stimulus hypoxia . The N - terminus of NKA has an established role in initiating NKA trafficking both to - and from the plasma membrane . Within the α - subunit Ser - 18 phosphorylation is required for NKA endocytosis while both Ser - 11 and Ser - 18 phosphorylation are required for NKA exocytosis . Also , the proline - rich motif upstream of the phosphorylation sites is required for PI - 3K binding and activation . Additionally , the L 30 KK motif has been identified as the interaction site for NKA to bind IP 3 receptor in response to nanomolar concentration of ouabain with implications in promoting cell growth by prevention of apoptosis ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , N - terminal peptide of NKA appears to be an important regulatory site for multiple signaling partners to interact . With more and more signaling pathways identified to be engaged with NKA , this group will continue to grow . Therefore we reasoned there should be a scaffold protein potentially organizing and regulating such diverse functional signaling pathways of NKA . PDZ domain containing proteins are good candidates because PDZ domain is widely distributed and there are around 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 % open reading frames in human genome encoding PDZ domains ( Schultz et al . , 2000 ) . We have chosen the PDZ protein h INAD to investigate in our model for reasons discussed in the previous section . We generated individual PDZ domain deletion mutants of h INAD tagged with GFP and determined their effects on DA - mediated NKA endocytosis ( paper III ) . PDZ domains 2 , 4 , 5 were identified as potential mediator of the DA effect on NKA endocytosis . Moreover , several potential signaling partners of h INAD have been identified including NKA , DA1r , PKC - ζ , PLC γ 1 , p85 α subunit of PI - 3K . These 40 results strongly support that h INAD is relevant and may organize the signal transducisome during DA - induced NKA endocytosis . With this established model we further examined hINAD effect on NKA traffic in response to AT II and insulin . Interestingly , deletion of PDZ domains 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 but not 2 of h INAD impaired NKA exocytosis in response to both AT II and insulin . This not only indicates that at one stage AT II and insulin share similar signaling pathway to stimulate NKA activity but also indicates that h INAD organizes the endocytosis and exocytosis of NKA by distinct mechanisms . The fact that Del 2 elicited an effect on NKA endocytosis but not exocytosis as well as its lacking of 200 kDa isoform of h INAD suggested that the receptor - signals might be organized at distinct subcellular locations . We have already identified several signaling partners activated in response to DA which assemble around NKA . Similarly , one may postulate a receptor activated exocytotic machinery assembling around NKA in the endosome which involves an alternative isoform of the full - length h INAD . Receptor - initiated signaling from the endosome membrane has been proposed by several studies ( Polo and Di Fiore , 2006 ; Sorkin and Von Zastrow , 2002 ; Uhles et al . , 2007 ; von Zastrow and Sorkin , 2007 ) which have cited many well established examples for both RTK and GPCR regulated pathway with some implications to our study . The hypothesis of endosome signaling derived from biochemical characterization of activated EGF receptor as well as various downstream effectors present in the endosome . For example adaptors like growth - factor - receptor - bound protein 2 ( Grb2 ) , SH2 - domain - containing transforming protein ( Shc ) , and Ras guanine - nucleotide exchange factor son - of - sevenless ( SOS ) remain associated with EGF receptors in endosomes ( Di Guglielmo et al . , 1994 ) . In our model insulin stimulated NKA exocytosis has been demonstrated to require phosphorylation of tyrosine 5 within NKA α subunit which suggests insulin receptor as a RTK member may resemble the EGF capable of forming signaling complex around NKA in the endosome . Examples for GPCR derived endosome signaling are most studied with β 2AR . Such as expressing dominant - negative mutant dynamin strongly inhibited β 2AR - mediated activation of extracellularly - responsive kinase / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( ERK / MAPK ) ½ without affecting the activation of adenylyl cyclase ( Daaka et al . , 1998 ) . This indicated GPCR endocytosis may have a specific role in activation of ERK / MAPK which may not only support our model of AT II stimulation of NKA in the kidney but also DA stimulation of NKA exocytosis via ERKs in the lung ( Guerrero et al . , 2002 ) . Future studies carried on our model may answer important questions on endosome signaling . This thesis has identified new and physiologically relevant molecular mechanisms involved in the hormonal regulation of NKA traffic . With regard to the studies in the kidney , it has direct physiological implications in the control sodium homeostasis because salt retention may lead to the development of high blood pressure ( Blaustein et al . , 2006 ) . It has been well recognized that DA in the kidney has a central role in fine tuning sodium balance together with other natriuretic hormones ( Aperia , 2000 ) . Excess AT II in the kidney may induce vasoconstriction and sodium retention which makes it another essential regulator of blood pressure . DA can oppose the effects of AT II which has been characterized as acting via DA1r to reduce AT1r expression in the proximal tubule ( Cheng 41 et al . , 1996 ) . With these connections , h INAD may potentially function as a higher order organizer to master - regulate sodium homeostasis . 42 6 .
