Current Biology 24 , 1436 , June 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Erratum Mechanical Forces of Fission Yeast Growth Nicolas Minc , Arezki Boudaoud , * and Fred Chang * ( Current Biology 19 , 1096 – 1101 ; July 14 , 2009 ) We report here an error in a formula in the above article that has consequence on a reported number . This error does not alter our main conclusions . The article reported measurement of mechanical parameters associated with ﬁssion yeast growth , namely , internal turgor pressure , forces of growing cells , and elastic modulus of the cell wall . The error we report here impacts only the exact value of elastic modulus of the cell wall . This error stems from an incorrect formula for the buckling force in Equation S4 . The corrected Equation S4 should be F B = p 2 IE cw L 2 T : ( Equation S4 ) This impacts Equations 2 and 4 , which should be corrected as F B = p 3 R 3 hE cw L 2 T ( Equation 2 ) and d = 3 p 3 8 R 2 ð D + d Þ 2 E ch ! E cw h = E cw h E (cid:2) : ( Equation 4 ) Consequently , the correct estimate of the surface modulus of the cell wall , based on reported experiments , is s cw = 6 . 4 6 1 . 9 N . m 2 1 , and the correct Young’s elastic modulus of the cell wall is E cw = 32 6 9 MPa . The authors regret any inconvenience this error may have caused . * Correspondence : arezki . boudaoud @ ens - lyon . fr ( A . B . ) , fc99 @ columbia . edu ( F .
