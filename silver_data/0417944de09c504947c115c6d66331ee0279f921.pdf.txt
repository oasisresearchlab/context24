Endophilin I is a presynaptic protein of unknown function that binds to dynamin , a GTPase that is implicated in endocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles . Here we show that endophilin I is essential for the formation of synaptic - like microvesicles ( SLMVs ) from the plasma membrane . Endophilin I exhibits lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase ( LPAAT ) activity , and endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation requires the transfer of the unsaturated fatty acid arachidonate to lysophosphatidic acid , converting it to phosphatidic acid . A deletion mutant lacking the SH3 domain through which endophilin I interacts with dynamin still exhibits LPAAT activity but no longer mediates SLMV formation . These results indicate that endophilin I may induce negative membrane curvature by converting an inverted - cone - shaped lipid to a cone - shaped lipid in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the bilayer . We propose that , through this action , endophilin I works with dynamin to mediate synaptic vesicle invagination from the plasma membrane and ﬁssion . Membrane trafﬁc mediated by vesicular carriers is a fundamental process in all eukaryotic cells . Any given trafﬁcking step requires two processes of membrane fusion ; that leading to the pinching - off of the vesicle from its donor membrane , called ﬁssion , and that resulting in the merging of the vesicle with its acceptor membrane . With regard to membrane ﬁssion , two principal models can be distinguished . These are not necessarily mutually exclusive but may reﬂect basic differences between the various types of intracellular donor membranes and vesicles . One model views the process of membrane ﬁssion as the ultimate consequence of membrane budding . Here , the continuation of the change of shape of the donor membrane by a proteinaceous coat machinery that mediates budding is thought to constrict the lipid bilayer at the edge of the polymerizing coat , that is , the neck of the nascent vesicle , sufﬁciently for membrane ﬁssion to occur . Studies on vesicle formation in the early secretory pathway have provided considerable evidence in support of this model , notably the demonstration that the coat proteins ( COP I and COP II ) are sufﬁcient to generate small lipid vesicles from lipo - somes , if the liposomes bear an integral membrane constituent ( lipid or membrane - anchored protein motif ) that is appropriate for coat recruitment 1 – 3 . The other model views membrane budding and membrane ﬁssion as being separate , though often linked , processes that are mediated by distinct proteinaceous machineries with the potential , but not the need , to interact . Here , following the coat - mediated formation of a membrane bud , membrane ﬁssion results from the action of a separate set of proteins that mediate the constriction of the narrow membrane tubule connecting the nascent vesicle with the donor membrane . Evidence supportingthismodelhaslargelybeen obtained in studies on endocytosis , in particular the recycling of synaptic vesicles from the plasma membrane 4 – 8 . Whereas the clathrin coat mediates bud formation 7 , 9 , a ring around the neck of the nascent vesicle , formed upon polymerization of the GTPase dynamin 10 , 11 , is thought to be central in membrane constriction and ﬁssion 4 – 6 , 8 . It has been proposed that this membrane constriction and ﬁssion is driven by a change in the conformation of dynamin that occurs upon GTP hydrolysis 4 , 5 , 8 , 11 – 14 . However , the view that dynamin itself acts as a ‘pinchase’ has been questioned 15 . In fact it appears that dynamin does not function as a force - generating GTPase but rather , like other members of the GTPase superfamily , activates an as yet unknown effector system when in the GTP - state , and it is this effector system that is essential for ﬁssion 16 , 17 . If so , dynamin - interacting proteins , such as the endophilin I ( originally called SH3p4 , ref . 18 ) that is studied here , are obvious candidates for this effector system . The shape of a membrane is inﬂuenced not only by proteins but also by lipids . The shape of membrane lipids is a key determinant of membrane curvature 19 – 21 . Inverted - cone - shaped lipids favour posi - tive curvature , which characterizes the outer leaﬂet of a membrane bud , and cone - shaped lipids favour negative curvature , as found in the inner leaﬂet of a bud . Examples of inverted - cone - shaped lipids and cone - shaped lipids include lysophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids , respectively 20 , 22 . Indeed , in one of the paradigms of membrane fusion , that of the inﬂuenza virus envelope with the plasma membrane mediated by the viral haemagglutinin 23 , 24 , the differentially shaped lipids lysophosphatidylcholine ( inverted cone ) and oleic acid ( cone ) affect the fusion process in an opposite ( negative and positive , respectively ) manner 22 . The shape of these lipids is thought to affect critically the transition between the intermediates in lipid bilayer organization that have been hypothe - sized to exist during the fusion process 20 , 21 . This raises two questions . First , do differently shaped lipids also have a role in membrane ﬁssion ? Second , how is lipid shape controlled ? Here we report on the role of endophilin I in the control of lipid shape and changes in membrane curvature underlying the formation of synaptic vesicles from the plasma membrane . ¶Present address : Protein Interaction Laboratory , University of Southern Denmark , Campusvej 55 , Odense , DK - 5230 Denmark ( A .

W . ) © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd Endophilin I is required for SLMV formation To identify rate - limiting factors for SLMV formation , we used a previously established perforated - cell system , derived from the rat neuroendocrine cell line PC12 , which reconstitutes this process 25 . This perforated - cell system is based on cell - surface biotinylation of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin , and its accumulation in a specialized domain of the plasma membrane at 18 8 C ( ref . 26 ) , followed by its incorporation into SLMVs upon cell perforation , addition of brain cytosol and ATP , and a return of the temperature to 37 8 C . In investigating whether the dynamin - interacting 27 , actin - binding protein proﬁlin was involved in SLMV formation , we noted that cytosol depleted of proﬁlin by passage over poly ( L - proline ) Sepharose 28 was much less efﬁcient than control cytosol but that addition of recombinant proﬁlin to the depleted cytosol did not fully restore SLMV formation ( Fig . 1a ) . This indicated that passage of cytosol over poly ( L - proline ) Sephar - ose led to the depletion of a protein ( or proteins ) other than proﬁlin that is required for SLMV formation . Elution of the proteins bound to poly ( L - proline ) Sepharose with 8 M urea revealed four major bands with relative molecular masses ( M r ) of 45K , 40K , 28Kand 15K ( Fig . 1b ) . Immunoblotting ( data not shown ) revealed the identity of the 45K and the 15K bands as actin and proﬁlin , respectively . Selective elution of the 40K protein and the 28K protein , along with some actin but without proﬁlin , was achieved using 30 % dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO ) ( Fig . 1b ) . Addi - tion of the DMSO eluate to depleted cytosol supplemented with recombinant proﬁlin fully restored SLMV formation ( Fig . 1a ) . High - accuracy matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization ( MALDI ) peptide - mass mapping revealed that the 40K protein was endophilin I ( originally called SH3p4 , refs 8 , 18 , 29 ) , with 51 % , 48 % and 44 % of the complete human ( accession no . Q99962 ) , complete mouse ( accession no . Q62420 ) and partial rat ( accession no . AF009603 ) sequence , respectively , being covered . Similarly , the 28K protein was unambiguously identiﬁed as the SH3 - and SH2 - domain - containing protein Grb2 ( data not shown ) . Endophilin I interacts with dynamin 30 , synaptojanin 30 , 31 and amphiphysin 29 , which have been implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling 6 , 8 , 32 . The identiﬁcation of the 40K protein as endophilin I indicated that this protein might be the relevant component in the DMSO eluate with regard to SLMV formation . We therefore investigated the effect of recombinant endophilin I on SLMV formation in the perforated - cell system using low - protein cytosol ( cytosol that is suboptimal for SLMV formation 25 ) . SLMV forma - tion in the presence of low - protein cytosol that had been completely depleted of endogenous endophilin I by passage over poly ( L - pro - line ) Sepharose ( as revealed by immunoblotting ; data not shown ) was almost as low ( Fig . 1c ) as the background value obtained in the absence of added cytosol . Addition to depleted cytosol of a con - centration of recombinant endophilin I corresponding to that in high - protein cytosol increased SLMV formation in the perforated - cell system to that observed with high - protein cytosol 25 ( Fig . 1c ) . This showed not only that endophilin I is the critical cytosolic component depleted by passage over poly ( L - proline ) Sepharose , but also that this protein is rate - limiting for SLMV formation . Conﬁrming the latter conclusion , addition of increasing amounts of recombinant endophilin I ( up to 16 m g ml - 1 ) to low - protein cytosol resulted in a progressive stimulation of SLMV formation , which approached the level obtained with high - protein cytosol ( data not shown ) . SLMV formation was also stimulated by recombinant endophilin I in a modiﬁed cell - free system , in a similar manner to the perforated - cell system ( data not shown ) . In this system , PC12 cells were biotinylated at 18 8 C and homogenized ( rather than only perforated ) , and the homogenate was subjected to cell - free reaction followed by isolation of SLMVs without further homogenization ( analogous to the cell - free system of ref . 33 ) . Endophilin I has LPAAT activity An independent line of investigation originated from the observa - tions 34 – 36 that stimulation of exocytosis in parotid acinar cells is associated with an increase in the activity of lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase ( LPAAT ) , which converts lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) to phosphatidic acid . The increase in LPAAT activity upon stimulation of secretion is due to phosphorylation by cyclic - AMP - dependent protein kinase or Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( refs 35 , 36 ) . To identify this phosphorylation - sensitive LPAAT , we puriﬁed it ( Table 1 ) . Bovine brain tissue was used as the source because LPAAT activity increases upon addition of either protein kinase to a brain - derived total post - nuclear membrane fraction 36 . Q - Sepharose ion - exchange chromatography gave two peaks of LPAAT activity , one ( peak I ) of which also contained lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) acyl transferase activity and was not signiﬁcantly stimulated by phosphorylation , and the other ( peak II ) of which did not exhibit signiﬁcant LPC acyl transferase activity but was stimulated by phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . LPAAT in peak II was puriﬁed to apparent homogeneity ( Table 1 ) . The ﬁnal puriﬁcaton step consisted of preparative , continuous elution SDS - polyacrylamide gel column electrophoresis ( ESPACE ) . The frac - tions obtained were examined for protein content by analytical SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( Fig . 2a ) and for LPAAT activity after protein renaturation ( Fig . 2b ) . This revealed a single , 40K protein band ( Fig . 2a ) , which coincided with LPAAT activity ( Fig . 2b ) , in fractions 18 – 30 . Two - dimensional ( 2D ) PAGE showed that the 40K protein band consisted of a single protein with articles 134 NATURE | VOL 401 | 9 SEPTEMBER 1999 | www . nature . com * * Cyt .

The sequence of ﬁve tryptic peptides obtained from the puriﬁed 40K protein ( AVMEIMTKT IEYL , IRGQEKGPGYPQAEA , GPGYPQAEALLAEAML , QGKIPD EELRQALE , EIAESSMFNLLEMD ) was identical to that of pre - dicted tryptic fragments of endophilin I . This , together with the ﬁnding that the reported molecular mass ( 40K , refs 30 , 31 ) and predicted isoelectric point ( pI 5 . 33 ) of endophilin I are , within the range of experimental accuracy , identical to those of the 40K band that comigrates with LPAAT activity upon puriﬁcation , indicates that LPAAT activity is intrinsic to endophilin I . When oleoyl - CoA was used as a co - substrate , the puriﬁed bovine brain enzyme exhibited a high speciﬁcity for LPA as substrate as compared to other lysophospholipids ( Table 2 ) . Moreover , like the enzyme studies in tissue 34 – 36 and crude subcellular fractions 35 , 36 , the activity of the puriﬁed enzyme was stimulated by phosphorylation with cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( Table 2 ) or Ca 2 + / calmodu - lin - dependent protein kinase II ( data not shown ) . Activation of the puriﬁed enzyme was accompanied by [ 32 P ] phosphate incorporation into the 40K band that approached a value of 1 mol of phosphate per mol of protein ( data not shown ) . To conﬁrm that endophilin I has LPAAT activity , recombinant endophilin I was expressed in bacteria as either His 6 - tagged or glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - fusion protein and analysed for LPAAT activity . To exclude a contribution of endogenous bacterial LPAAT , which is a transmembrane protein 37 , the bacteria were lysed by freezing - thawing in the absence of detergent , followed by ultra - centrifugation . The high - speed supernatant obtained from bacteria transformed with vector containing the insert encoding His 6 - tagged endophilin I exhibited LPAAT activity in the presence of LPA and arachidonoyl - CoA as exogenous substrates , whereas that obtained after transformation with vector lacking the insert did not ( Fig . 3a ) . The same results were obtained when oleoyl - CoA was used instead of arachidonoyl - CoA ( data not shown ) . Recombinant His 6 - tagged endophilin I was puriﬁed from the bacterial high - speed supernatant by afﬁnity chromatography on poly ( L - proline ) Sepharose ( Fig . 3b ) . Puriﬁed recombinant endo - philin I exhibited LPAAT - activity ( Fig . 3c ) . In contrast , a poly ( L - proline ) eluate obtained from the high - speed supernatant of bac - teria transformed with vector lacking insert , which did not contain endophilin I ( Fig . 3b ) , did not show detectable LPAAT activity ( Fig . 3c ) .

The LPAAT activity of recombinant , His 6 - tagged or GST - fused endophilin I , puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography on metal chelate - or GSH - matrices , respectively , was dependent on the presence of exogenous LPA ( Fig . 3d and data not shown ) and was stimulated by phosphorylation with cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( Table 2 ) . Puriﬁed recombinant endophilin I showed essentially the same speciﬁcity for LPA as substrate , as compared to other lysopho - spholipids , as did the enzyme puriﬁed from bovine brain ( Table 2 ) . Given the original observation that the poly ( L - proline ) DMSO eluate obtained from brain cytosol , which was highly enriched in endophilin I ( Fig . 1b ) , promoted SLMV formation in the perfo - rated - cell system ( Fig . 1a ) , it was important to verify that this eluate exhibited LPAAT activity . This was indeed the case ( Fig . 3e ) . Endophilin I binds fatty acyl - CoA and LPA Endophilin I was depleted from brain cytosol upon passage over a palmitoyl - CoA agarose column , in contrast to the bulk of the cytosolic proteins and Grb2 ( Fig . 4a ) , another SH3 - domain - con - taining protein with an isoelectric point similar to that of endo - philin I . Binding of endophilin I to palmitoyl - CoA agarose was prevented when cytosol was loaded onto the column in the presence of free palmitoyl - CoA ( Fig . 4b ) . Likewise , endophilin I bound to palmitoyl - CoA agarose was eluted from the column by free palmi - toyl - CoA ( Fig . 4a ) . These results indicate that endophilin I binds fatty acyl - CoA . To investigate the binding of endophilin I to LPA , we prepared a radioactive photoactivatable analogue of LPA , [ 32 P ] 1 - ( 10 - azi - stear - oyl ) - LPA . When a high - speed supernatant obtained from bacteria transformed with vector containing the insert encoding His 6 - tagged endophilin I was subjected to UV - irradiation in the presence of the photoactivatable LPA , a 32 P - labelled 40K band was observed ( Fig . 4c , left ) that coincided with recombinant endophilin I detected by protein staining ( Fig . 4c , right ) . Labelling of this band was depen - dent on UV - irradiation ( Fig . 4c ) and was blocked by excess unlabelled LPA ( data not shown ) . The 40K band was not detected when a high - speed supernatant from bacteria transformed with vector lacking insert was used , in contrast to an endogenous bacterial 45K protein that was equally labelled in both supernatants ( Fig . 4c ) . Similar photoafﬁnity labelling was observed for the GST – endophilin - I fusion protein ( data not shown ) . We conclude that endophilin I binds LPA . Effects of added LPA and fatty acyl - CoA Addition of 1 m M LPA to the perforated - cell system did not signiﬁcantly affect the basal SLMV formation observed with low - protein cytosol , but completely blocked the ability of exogenously added recombinant endophilin I to mediate SLMV formation ( Fig . 5a ) . This is consistent with the interpretation that exogenously added LPA competitively prevents endophilin I from acting on LPA in the donor membrane . To investigate the requirement for fatty acyl - CoA in SLMV formation mediated by endophilin I , we used the unsaturated articles 136 NATURE | VOL 401 | 9 SEPTEMBER 1999 | www . nature . com Figure 4 Endophilin I binds to fatty acyl - CoA and LPA . a , b , Binding of endophilin I from brain cytosol to palmitoyl - CoA agarose .

Enph I , endophilin I . © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd fatty acid arachidonoyl - CoA rather than the saturated fatty acid palmitoyl - CoA because , upon stimulation of secretion , the increase in incorporation of arachidonate into phosphatidic acid is greater than that of palmitate 34 . In the standard perforated - cell system using gel - ﬁltered low - protein cytosol , addition of 10 m M exogenous arachidonoyl - CoA in the presence of recombinant endophilin I did not increase SLMV formation above the level obtained by addition of endophilin I alone ( Fig . 5b , left ) . Likewise , arachido - noyl - CoA did not increase the basal SLMV formation obtained without addition of endophilin I ( data not shown ) . This indicated that , under these conditions , endogenous arachidonoyl - CoA was not rate - limiting . Presumably , in the presence of gel - ﬁltered cytosol , the source of fatty acyl - CoA was fatty acid derived from membrane phospholipids through endogenous phospholipase A 2 ( PLA 2 ) fol - lowed by activation by cytosolic fatty acyl - CoA synthase . To remove free fatty acids and fatty acyl - CoA from the mem - branes , the perforated cells were pretreated with fatty acid - free bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . Including PLA 2 under non - lytic conditions ( see Methods ) during the BSA pretreatment reduced basal SLMV formation in the subsequent perforated - cell reaction to about half of that observed after BSA pretreatment in the absence of added PLA 2 ; addition of 10 m M arachidonoyl - CoA during the perforated - cell reaction following BSA / PLA 2 pretreatment restored basal SLMV formation to the original level ( data not shown ) . We therefore used this pretreatment to show that arachidonoyl - CoA is required for endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation . Compared to the marked stimulation of SLMV formation by endophilin I seen without BSA / PLA 2 pretreatment ( Fig . 5b left ) , BSA / PLA 2 pretreat - ment greatly reduced endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation in the absence of exogenously added arachidonoyl - CoA ( Fig . 5b right ) ; addition of 10 m M arachidonoyl - CoA doubled the endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation ( Fig . 5b right ) . We conclude that endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation requires fatty acyl - CoA . We next investigated whether palmitoyl - CoA , which , like arachi - donoyl - CoA , can be used as substrate by endophilin I to generate phosphatidic acid ( data not shown ) , also supported endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation . In the standard perforated - cell system using low - protein cytosol , addition of 2 . 5 m M ( data not shown ) or 10 m M ( Fig . 5c ) of palmitoyl - CoA completely blocked endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation , in contrast to arachidonoyl - CoA ( Fig . 5b ) . Addition of 2 m M LPC , which was a much poorer substrate for endophilin I than LPA ( Table 2 ) , also inhibited endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation ( Fig . 5d ) . A PLA 2 inhibitor potentiates SLMV formation If SLMV formation mediated by endophilin 1 is due to the conversion of LPA to phosphatidic acid , one might expect that a PLA 2 inhibitor acts synergistically with endophilin I in SLMV formation because the reverse reaction , the hydrolysis of phospha - tidic acid to LPA and free fatty acid , which presumably occurs during the perforated - cell reaction owing to the activity of cytosolic PLA 2 , would be prevented . Indeed , the speciﬁc inhibitor of cytosolic calcium - dependent and - independent PLA 2 , methyl arachidonyl ﬂuorophosphonate ( MAFP 38 ) , strongly potentiated endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation ( Fig . 6a ) . This observation indicates that endogenous cytosolic PLA 2 may be able to antagonize the action of endophilin I in SLMV formation . In most of the experiments described above , the effects of recombinant endophilin I on SLMV formation were investigated in the presence of low - protein cytosol , which by itself supported a basal level of SLMV formation . Given the results of Fig . 1c , this basal SLMV formation can largely be attributed to the endophilin I endogenously present in low - protein cytosol ( , 6 m g ml - 1 ) . Like the SLMV formation mediated by addition of exogenous endophi - lin I ( Fig . 6a ) , the basal SLMV formation should therefore be sensitive to agents affecting hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid . Indeed , addition of MAFP moderately stimulated basal SLMV formation ( Fig . 6b ) . Conversely , addition of exogenous PLA 2 derived from snake venom markedly reduced basal SLMV forma - tion ( Fig . 6c ) , the residual level being only slightly above that observed without addition of any cytosol ( data not shown ) . The role of the SH3 domain of endophilin I Dynamin , which is an essential component of the machinery that mediates SLMV formation in our perforated - cell system 25 , is recruited to , and forms rings at , the necks of synaptic vesicles budding from their donor membrane 4 . Endophilin I binds , by its SH3 domain , to the proline - rich region of dynamin 30 . We therefore investigated whether SLMV formation mediated by endophilin I involved protein – protein interaction through its SH3 domain . A , 34K deletion mutant of endophilin I lacking the SH3 domain ( referred to as del - endophilin I ) still exhibited LPAAT activity ( Fig . 7a ) but no longer mediated SLMV formation , at least not at the concentration tested ( , 10 m g ml - 1 ; Fig . 7b ) . This shows that protein – protein interaction of endophilin I through its SH3 domain is essential for its ability to mediate SLMV formation . Although endophilin I binds not only to dynamin 30 but also synaptojanin 30 , 31 , we interpret the need for its SH3 domain in terms of an interaction with dynamin rather than synaptojanin because , in perforated PC12 cells supplemented with cytosol depleted of both dynamin and synaptojanin , addition of dynamin alone is sufﬁcient to restore SLMV formation 25 . Speciﬁcally , we propose that the interaction with dynamin results in the recruit - ment of endophilin I , and hence its LPAAT activity , to the mem - brane of budding synaptic vesicles . Discussion We have provided several lines of evidence that endophilin I has LPAAT activity . First , endophilin I isolated from brain using ESPACE as the ﬁnal puriﬁcation step appears as a single 40K protein on analytical SDS - and 2D PAGE and exhibits LPAAT activity after articles NATURE | VOL 401 | 9 SEPTEMBER 1999 | www . nature . com 137 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 Enph I _ + + MAFP _ _ + a 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 PLA2 Con c b 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 MAFP Con B i o t . sy na p t o p h ys i n i n S L M V s ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) B i o t . sy na p t o p h ys i n i n S L M V s ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) B i o t . sy na p t o p h ys i n i n S L M V s ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Figure 6 Effects of PLA 2 and the PLA 2 inhibitor MAFP on endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation .

The protein clearly eluted with a higher apparent molecular mass than the transmembrane LPAATs described so far 39 , 40 ; all of the latter migrate with apparent relative molecular masses of , 29 – 31K , and no such band was detected in the fractions containing the puriﬁed endophilin I and exhibiting LPAATactivity . Second , recombinant endophilin I exhibited LPAAT activity after various types of puriﬁcation ( GSH - column for GST – endophilin - I , metal - chelate column for His 6 – endophilin - I , poly ( L - proline ) column for either fusion protein ) . Moreover , recombinant endo - philin Iwas solely responsible for the LPAATactivity observed in the soluble fraction obtained from transformed bacteria lysed by freez - ing / thawing . Third , endophilin I binds to palmitoyl - CoA and was photoafﬁnity - labelled by a photoactivatable LPA analogue , showing that it physically interacts with its two substrates . A phosphorylation - induced increase in LPAAT activity , appar - ently reﬂecting the stimulation of LPAAT activity in response to secretagogue originally observed in parotid acinar cells 34 , has been observed in a postnuclear membrane fraction 36 . This led us to anticipate that this LPAAT activity would reside in a membrane - associated protein . We therefore used a crude membrane fraction as a source for LPAAT puriﬁcation . How , then , can it be explained that this puriﬁcation yielded endophilin I , which upon hypo - osmotic lysis of synaptosomes is largely recovered in the soluble fraction 31 , consistent with it being a cytosolic protein ? Presumably , the crude membrane fraction used as starting material for the solubilization of LPAAT , which was obtained from a relatively low - speed iso - osmotic supernatant , still contained synaptosomes ( sealed nerve terminals ) which , in line with the presynaptic localization of endophilin I ( ref . 30 ) , are enriched in this protein . The observations that low - protein cytosol depleted of endophilin I barely supported SLMV formation in the perforated - cell system and that addition of recombinant endophilin I to this cytosol restored SLMV formation to the level obtained with high - protein cytosol indicate an essential role for endophilin I in this process . The function of endophilin I in SLMV formation appears to be mediated by its LPAATactivity . First , under conditions designed to lower the endogenous fatty acyl - CoA content of the perforated cells , endo - philin - I - mediated SLMV formation was largely dependent on exogenous arachidonoyl - CoA . Second , exogenous LPA blocked endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation , presumably by prevent - ing the action of endophilin I on the endogenous LPA in the SLMV donor membrane . Third , endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation was strongly promoted by the PLA 2 inhibitor MAFP , which would stabilize the effect of the LPAATreaction catalysed by endophilin I , that is , an increase in the phosphatidic acid / LPA ratio . There are several potential mechanisms by which the LPAAT activity of endophilin I could mediate SLMV formation . One is that the phosphatidic acid generated by endophilin I in the donor membrane either stimulates , by activating phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 ) P ) 5 - kinase 41 , the formation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , or increases phosphoinositide levels by serving as a precursor in their synthesis . A local increase in the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level in the donor membrane may promote the recruitment of dynamin via its pleckstrin - homology domain , and thereby stimulate SLMV formation 8 , 41 , 42 . Phosphatidic acid may also directly promote dyna - min - mediated changes in membrane shape , given that an increase in the amount of phosphatidic acid in liposomes favours the formation of dynamin - coated tubules 13 . However , we have observed that addition of phospholipase D ( PLD ) , which increases phospha - tidic acid by hydrolysing phosphatidylcholine , does not increase SLMV formation in the perforated - cell system although , in parallel experiments using another cell - free system , it did increase secretory vesicle formation from the trans - Golgi network ( data not shown ) , conﬁrming previous observations 43 . This may indicate that endo - philin I mediates SLMV formation not simply because it increases phosphatidic acid , but also because it concomitantly consumes LPA . This leads us to consider changes in membrane curvature as a central feature of the mechanism by which endophilin I mediates the formation of SLMVs and , by extrapolation , the recycling of synaptic vesicles . Synaptic vesicles are the smallest physiologically occurring vesicles of biological membranes known . The neck of a budding synaptic vesicle , especially when this budding occurs from the planar plasma membrane , is therefore characterized by greater membrane curvature than that of other membrane vesicles .

Left : nascent vesicle with neck surrounded by a dynamin ring ( drawn in line with its snake 17 or Ferrari 49 function in endocytosis ) . The cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer is shaded . Owing to its interaction with dynamin I ( ref . 30 ) , endophilin I is recruited to the neck of the nascent vesicle . The LPAAT activity of endophilin I ( arrow ) converts LPA by addition of arachidonate to PA , thereby changing an inverted - cone - shaped lipid inducing positive membrane curvature ( red wedge ) to a cone - shaped lipid inducing negative curvature ( blue wedge ) in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet . This may promote the transition from the bud ( positive curvature ) to the neck ( negative curvature in the spatial x – y plane shown ) that precedes ﬁssion . Right : in addition to the same view of the nascent vesicle as in the left panel , a cross - section at the neck ( dashed line ) is shown at the top . This illustrates the positive membrane curvature that exists in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet ( shaded ) at the neck in the spatial plane of the cross - section ( x – z ) , in contrast to the negative curvature found upon 90 8 rotation of this spatial plane ( x – y ) . The endophilin - I - catalysed conversion ( arrow ) of the positive - curvature - inducinglipidLPA ( redwedge ) tothenegative - curvature - inducinglipidPA ( blue wedge ) may promote the constriction of the neck towards ﬁssion . Note that in addition to ﬁssion , otherstepsin vesicleformation ( not illustrated ) suchascoatedpitinvaginationare also associated with a positive - to - negative change in membrane curvature and that endophilin - I - mediated LPA - to - PA conversion may also operate in these steps . © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd ﬁcally , the positive membrane curvature that exists in the cytoplas - mic leaﬂet of a coated pit and bud changes to negative membrane curvature in one of the two spatial dimensions : at the edge of the coated pit as it invaginates from the planar plasma membrane to form a bud , and at the constricting neck of a bud proceeding to ﬁssion from either the planar plasma membrane or a tubular plasma membrane invagination . Inverted - cone - shaped membrane lipids and cone - shaped membrane lipids induce positive and negative membrane curvature , respectively 19 , 20 . LPA is thought to be an inverted - cone - shaped lipid , and phosphatidic acid ( especially with arachidonate in position 2 of the glycerol backbone ) a cone - shaped lipid 20 . Moreover , inverted - cone - shaped lipids and cone - shaped lipids have been proposed to affect membrane fusion in a differential manner 20 , 22 . It is therefore conceivable that endophilin I mediates synaptic vesicle formation because the conversion of LPA to an appropriate phosphatidic acid , catalysed by the LPAATactivity of endophilin I , induces the positive - to - negative membrane curva - ture change in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet that is required for coated pit invagination and , as shown in Fig . 8 , the constriction of the neck of a budding synaptic vesicle during ﬁssion . Such a mechanism would explain why the unsaturated fatty acid arachidonoyl - CoA supported endophilin - I - mediated SLMV forma - tion , whereas the saturated fatty acid palmitoyl - CoA blocked this process . In linewith its ability to usepalmitoyl - CoAassubstrate ( data not shown ) , endophilin I may have generated a phosphatidic acid with palmitate in position 2 . Such a phosphatidic acid may be non - productive for SLMV formation because its generation from LPA would result in a much less pronounced shape change of the lipid from inverted cone to cone than that upon addition of arachidonate . Alternatively , palmitoyl - CoA , which , in contrast to arachidonoyl - CoA , is an inverted - cone - shaped lipid , may have blocked endophi - lin - I - mediated SLMV formation not as a substrate but by acting directly on the lipid bilayer , which would imply a profound sensitivity of SLMV formation to lipid shape . Direct evidence for an inhibition of endophilin - I - mediated SLMV formation by inverted - cone - shaped lipids was obtained using LPC ( C10 : 0 in position 1 ) . LPC is not a substrate for endophilin I and hence would presumably not interfere with endophilin - I - catalysed con - version of LPA to phosphatidic acid . Previous models of dynamin function have suggested that this protein itself may operate as a ‘pinchase’ at the neck of synaptic and other endocytic vesicles 5 , 8 . However , evidence has been reported 16 that dynamin does not function as a force - generating GTPase but rather , like other members of the GTPase superfamily , activates a downstream effector . Our observations raise the possibility that endophilin I constitutes this effector , which would be recruited to the membrane , and perhaps activated , by dynamin to mediate ﬁssion . Consistent with this concept , the deletion mutant of endophilin I lacking the SH3 domain , which still exhibited LPAAT activity but presumably no longer bound to dynamin , did not mediate SLMV formation . Activation of endophilin I upon its dynamin - mediated recruitment to the membrane would also explain why the rate of acyl transfer of soluble endophilin I was relatively low ( # 17 mUmg - 1 protein ) . In mammals , endophilin I belongs to a protein family whose other members are endophilin II and endophilin III ( originally called SH3p8 and SH3p13 , respectively ) , which also interact with dynamin 30 . Like endophilin I , whose tissue distribution is indis - tinguishable from that of dynamin I , endophilins II and III co - distribute with dynamins II and III , respectively 30 , consistent with the existence of endophilin I – dynamin I , endophilin II – dynamin II and endophilin III – dynamin III complexes . This raises the possi - bility that the mechanism of positive - to - negative membrane cur - vature change in vesicle formation that we propose ( the conversion of an inverted - cone - shaped lipid to a cone - shaped lipid by addition of a fatty acyl chain to a lyso - glycero - lipid ) operates not only in SLMV / synaptic vesicle formation mediated by endophilin I – dyna - min I but , perhaps , also in the formation of other vesicles by endophilin II – dynamin II and endophilin III – dynamin III . Furthermore , this mechanism ( operating not necessarily only with arachidonate ) may not be conﬁned to dynamin - dependent pinching - off of vesicles from donor membranes , but may be a common feature of vesicle formation and particularly membrane ﬁssion . Palmitoyl transfer to an unidentiﬁed acceptor is required in the pinching - off of Golgi - derived vesicles 44 – 46 . Perhaps this acceptor , too , is LPA , given the observation that BARS - 50 , a protein substrate of brefeldin A - dependent ADP - ribosylation , induces the ﬁssion of Golgi tubules by palmitoyl transfer to a membrane lipid ( R . Weigert et al . , unpublished observation ) .

Ratbraincytosol 25 ( 1 . 5 – 3ml , 7 . 5mgproteinperml ) was subjected to a single passage over a column containing , 1ml of packed poly ( L - proline ) - coated Sepharose beads 28 and the ﬂow - through was collected ( depleted cytosol ) . The columnwaswashedwith20mlofGGAbuffer 25 andelutedeitherdirectlywith2mlof8M urea containing 10mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 4 or with 2ml of 30 % ( w / v ) DMSO diluted in GGA buffer followed by 2ml of 8M urea containing 10mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 4 . The DMSO eluate ( and , as control , 30 % DMSO in GGA buffer ) was extensively dialysed against GGA buffer containing 5mM reduced glutathione , followed by concentration using Centricon - 10 to , 200 m l , which contained , 30 m g of endophilin I as judged by SDS - PAGE using recombinant endophilin I as standard . Protein identiﬁcation For MALDI , protein bands were excised from the gel and in - gel digested with trypsin as described 47 . Peptide - massmapping wasperformed onaBrukerReﬂex mass spectrometer , andthelistofpeptidemassessearchedagainstanon - redundantproteinsequencedatabase with an accuracy better than 50p . p . m . For protein sequencing of tryptic peptides , , 10 m g of the 40K protein puriﬁed from bovine brain through the ESPACE step was digested twice for 2h at 37 8 C with 0 . 1 m g TPCK - trypsin . PeptideswereseparatedbyRP - HPLC ( VYDAC218TP ) usinga0 . 1 % TFA / acetonitrile gradient and sequenced by the Edman method using an ABI sequenator . Palmitoyl - CoA agarose adsorption and elution All steps were performed at 4 8 C . Rat brain cytosol ( 0 . 8ml , 7 . 5mg protein per ml ) was subjected , with or without 40mM added free palmitoyl - CoA , to a single passage over a columncontaining1 . 5mlofpackedpalmitoyl - CoAagarosebeads ( Sigma , equilibrated in GGA buffer ) , and the ﬂow - through was collected . The column was washed with 20ml of GGA buffer and eluted with 0 . 5ml of GGA buffer containing 4mM free palmitoyl - CoA ( kept in the column overnight ) followed by 3 . 5ml of GGA buffer ( total eluate 3 . 5ml ) . Recombinant endophilin I A full - length endophilin I cDNAwas generated byPCR ( Pwo ) using a mouse brain cDNA library and primers ( sense primer 5 9 - CGAATACGAGGATCCATGTCGGTGG - CAGGGCTGAAG , antisense primer 5 9 - GCTTAACGAGAATTCCTAATGGGGCAGAG - CAACCAG ) designed according to the sequence of mouse endophilin I ( ref . 18 ) . The cDNAwas cloned into pGEX2T ( Pharmacia ) and pQE30 ( Qiagen ) to obtain GST - and His 6 - tagged fusion proteins , respectively . A cDNA coding for a truncated endophilin I ( amino acids 1 – 293 , referred to as del - endophilin I ) , which lacks the SH3 domain , was generated by PCR using the full - length endophilin I cDNA , the above sense primer and the antisense primer 5 9 - TCGCGAAGCGGTACCGATCTGATCCATTTGGACACCTGG , which encodes a stop codon after amino acid 293 and contains a Kpn I restriction site . The PCR product was digested with Bam H1 and Kpn I and ligated into pQE30 to obtain His 6 – del - endophilin I . ThefusionproteinswereexpressedinBL21orBL21 - d ( inducibleforlysozyme ) bacteria ( Stratagene ) . Bacteriawerelysedbytwocyclesofrapidfreezing / thawinginPBS ( 25mlper 1 - L culture pellet ) . All subsequent steps were performed at 4 8 C . After addition of aprotinin ( 5 m gml - 1 ) , leupeptin ( 10 m gml - 1 ) , benzamidine ( 1mM ) , PMSF ( 0 . 5mM ) and DNaseI ( 10 m gml - 1 , grade I , Boehringer ) and incubation for 15min , the lysate was centrifuged for 10min at 10 , 000 g and the resulting supernatant for 75min at 280 , 000 g . The high - speed supernatant ( , 6mg protein per ml ) was used for LPAATassays ( Fig . 3a ) , LPA - photoafﬁnitylabelling ( Fig . 4c ) , andthepuriﬁcation ofrecombinant endophilinIby either poly ( L - proline ) afﬁnitychromatography ( used to obtain the data shown in Figs 1c , 3b , c and 5b ) or metal - chelate chromatography ( used to obtain data not shown ) . In some experiments , pelleted bacteria were lysed ( all steps at 4 8 C ) in 50mM sodium phosphate pH 8 . 0 , 300mM NaCl , 10mM imidazol , 2mM Pefabloc ( Boehringer ) using sonication followed by addition of Triton X - 100 ( 1 % ( v / v ) ﬁnal ) and centrifugation for 15min at 12 , 000 g max ; the resulting supernatant was used for the puriﬁcation of recombinant endophilinIusingeithermetal - chelatechromatography ( usedtoobtainthedatashownin Figs 3d , 5 , 6a , b , 7 and Table 2 ) or GSH afﬁnity chromatography ( used to obtain the data shown in Table 2 ) . Recombinant endophilin Iwas puriﬁed by poly ( L - proline ) - afﬁnity chromatography as described above , except that DMSO was removed from the eluate by gel ﬁltration using a PD - 10columnequilibratedinGGAbufferfollowedbyconcentrationusingCentricon - 10 . Puriﬁcation of recombinant endophilin I by metal - chelate chromatography was per - formedusingTalon ( Clontech ) equilibratedwith50mMNaH 2 PO 4 pH8 . 0 , 300mMNaCl , 10mM imidazol , 2mM Pefabloc ; washing and elution used the same buffer except that imidazol was increased to 20mM and 150mM , respectively . Afﬁnity chromatography using GSH - agarose was performed according to standard procedures . There was no obvious difference with regard to LPAATactivity and SLMV formation between the recombinant His 6 – endophilin I puriﬁed by poly ( L - proline ) afﬁnity chromatography from bacteria lysed by freezing / thawing , that puriﬁed by metal - chelate chromatography from such bacterial lysate , and that puriﬁed by metal - chelate chromatography from bacteria lysed by sonication / Triton X - 100 ( data not shown ) . As control , induced bacteria transformed with vector lacking the endophilin I insert were subjected in parallel to the same procedures of lysis , centrifugation and afﬁnity chromatography , as indicated in the Figure legends . Photoafﬁnity labelling using [ 32 P ] 1 - ( 10 - azi - stearoyl ) - LPA 10 - azi - stearic acid was prepared from 10 - keto - stearic acid methyl ester ( methyl 10 - oxooctadecanoate , Aldrich ) . AtT - 20 cells ( one 10 - cm dish ) were grown for 16h in 8ml of phosphate - free DMEM ( Sigma ) supplemented with 18 % serum ( horse serum / FCS 2 / 1 , delipidated by extraction with organic solvent ( C . T . , Y . Wang & W . B . H . , manuscript in preparation ) ) and containing , 70 m M 10 - azi - stearic acid ( solubilized in serum 48 ) and 1 . 5mCi carrier - free inorganic [ 32 P ] phosphate . The cells were extracted with chloroform / methanol and the chloroform phase subjected to thin - layerchromatography ( TLC ) using silica gel 60 ( 0 . 25mm , Merck ) and chloroform / methanol / water 65 / 35 / 8 as solvent . Phosphatidylcholine ( PC , identiﬁed by minimal iodine vapour ) was scraped from the plate , extractedusingchloroform / methanol / water65 / 35 / 8anddried . Afterredissolvingin 800 m l of diethylether / methanol 98 / 2 , PC was converted to LPC using 250 m g PLA 2 ( C . adamanteus ) for2hat25 8 C ( ref . 50 ) . Thewholereactionmixturewasdried , redissolvedin 500 m l20mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 5mM CaCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and after addition of PLD ( 1000U , S . chromofuscus , Sigma ) vigorouslyshakenat30 8 Cfor2htoconvertLPCtoLPA . After drying , lipids were dissolved in 300 m l chloroform / methanol / water 65 / 35 / 8 and subjected to TLC ( chloroform / methanol / water / AcOH 65 / 35 / 8 / 6 ) . The region of the thin - layer plate containing the [ 32 P ] 1 - ( 10 - azi - stearoyl ) - LPA ( identiﬁed by phosphoimaging and deduced from the mobility of LPA ) was scraped and extracted with chloroform / methanol / water / AcOH 65 / 35 / 8 / 6 . The yield of the ﬁnal product was , 8 m Ci . For each photoafﬁnity - labelling reaction , 20 m l of [ 32 P ] 1 - ( 10 - azi - stearoyl ) - LPA ( 10 m Ciml - 1 , speciﬁcactivityintherangeof0 . 1 – 1 m Ci m g - 1 ) wasdriedandredissolvedin 25 m lof50mMHepes - NaOHpH8 . 0undersonicationfor2min . Afteradditionof50 m lof GGA buffer and 25 m l of 280 , 000 g supernatant ( 150 m g protein ) from a lysate of bacteria transformed without or with the insert coding for His 6 – endophilin I , the samples were either placed under the ﬁltered , focused beam ( . 310nm ) of a mercury lamp and UV - irradiated for 1min at room temperature or kept for 1min at room temperature without UV irradiation , followed in either case by addition of Laemmli sample buffer . LPAAT assays For the results shown in Fig . 2b and Tables 1 and 2 , LPAATactivity was assayed in a ﬁnal reactionvolume of 200 m l containing , in addition to appropriate aliquots of the fractions obtained during and after puriﬁcation , 10mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ; 0 . 1mM EDTA , 25mM sucrose ; 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) BSA ; 100 m M of LPA ( 1 - oleoyl ) ( or the other lyso - phospholipids indicated in Table 2 ) ; 40 m M [ 14 C ] oleoyl - CoA ( 10 – 15 m Cimol - 1 ) . To determine the substrate speciﬁcity of puriﬁed and recombinant endophilin I , 7 m g , 2 m g and 10 m g of endophilin I puriﬁed from bovine brain , His 6 – endophilin I , and GST – endophilin I , respectively , was used per assay . Reactions were carried out for 10min at 37 8 C and terminated by the addition of 2ml chloroform / methanol ( 2 / 1 ) , followed by addition of 1ml 0 . 1M KCl . The organic phase was collected , dried , and subjected to TLC using chloroform / acetone / methanol / acetic acid / water ( 50 / 20 / 10 / 10 / 5 ) . Radioactivity in phos - phatidic acid on the TLC plates was determined using a Berthold thin - layer radioactivity scanner . Fordetermining theeffect ofphosphorylation ofendophilinIon itsLPAATactivity , we incubated 2 . 2 m g of either endophilin I puriﬁed from bovine brain , His 6 – endophilin I or GST – endophilin I for 30min at 37 8 C in a ﬁnal reaction volume of 20 m l containing in addition 40mM Hepes – NaOH pH 7 . 4 , 9mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 23mM ATP and 7 . 5 m gml - 1 catalytic subunit of PKA . After the phosphorylation reaction , samples were subjected to LPAATassayasabove . TheLPAATactivityobservedafteraphosphorylationreactioninthe absence of added PKAwas similar to that observed without performing the phosphor - ylation reaction .
