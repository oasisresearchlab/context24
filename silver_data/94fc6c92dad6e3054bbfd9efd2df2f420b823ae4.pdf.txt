SUMMARY Removal of introns from pre - messenger RNAs ( pre - mRNAs ) via splicing provides a versatile means of genetic regulation that is often disrupted in human diseases . To decipher how splicing occurs in real time , we directly examined with single - molecule sensitivity the kinetics of intron excision from pre - mRNA in the nucleus of living human cells . By using two different RNA labeling methods , MS2 and l N , we show that b - globin introns are transcribed and excised in 20 – 30 s . Furthermore , we show that replacing the weak polypyrimidine ( Py ) tract in mouse immunoglobulin m ( IgM ) pre - mRNA by a U - rich Py decreases the intron lifetime , thus provid - ing direct evidence that splice - site strength inﬂu - ences splicing kinetics . We also found that RNA polymerase II transcribes at elongation rates ranging between 3 and 6 kb min (cid:1) 1 and that transcription can be rate limiting for splicing . These results have important implications for a mechanistic under - standing of cotranscriptional splicing regulation in the live - cell context . INTRODUCTION In eukaryotes , extensive modiﬁcation and alternative processing of the initial products of gene transcription can profoundly affect the diversity and function of the proteins that are gener - ated from a single gene ( Nilsen and Graveley , 2010 ) . In addition to providing a versatile means of genetic regulation , removal of introns from pre - mRNAs by splicing is implicated in many human genetic diseases as either a direct cause , a modiﬁer of disease severity , or a determinant of disease susceptibility ( Cooper et al . , 2009 ) . Splicing is carried out by the spliceosome , an elaborate macromolecular machine composed of uridine - rich small nu - clear RNAs ( UsnRNAs ) packaged as ribonucleoprotein particles ( snRNPs ) that in human cells function in conjunction with over 200 distinct non - snRNP auxiliary proteins ( Will and Lu¨hrmann , 2011 ) . Spliceosomes build anew on every intron that is synthe - sized and then disassemble for the next round of splicing ( Staley and Guthrie , 1998 ) . Thus , unlike many other cellular enzymes that contain preformed , stable active sites , the spliceosome exhibits exceptional compositional and structural dynamics . In a recent study , the dynamic assembly of a single spliceosome was followed in real time in whole - cell extracts ( Hoskins et al . , 2011 ) . That study revealed that association of spliceosomal subcomplexes with pre - mRNA occurs in an ordered pathway , that every subcomplex binding step is reversible , and that early binding events do not fully commit a pre - messenger RNA ( pre - mRNA ) to splicing ( Hoskins et al . , 2011 ) . This implies that potentially any step during spliceosome formation might be subject to regulation . Spliceosome assembly is indeed highly regulated : depending on the combinatorial effect of proteins that either promote or repress the recognition of the core splicing sequences , splice sites in pre - mRNA can be differentially selected to produce multiple mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing . In vitro , transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II are spliced within 15 – 60 min ( Das et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , electron microscopy analysis of Drosophila embryo genes and Balbiani ring genes in the salivary glands of the dipteran Chironomus tentans revealed that intron excision occurs within 2 . 5 – 3 min after transcription ( Beyer and Osheim , 1988 ; Wetterberg et al . , 2001 ) , which suggests that pre - mRNA splicing is much more efﬁcient in the cell nucleus than in nuclear extracts . Moreover , a large body of compelling evidence indicates that pre - mRNA splicing is tightly coupled to transcription and therefore should not be studied in isolation from other stages of gene expression ( Maniatis and Reed , 2002 ) . In particular , a kinetic model was proposed in which the spliceosome requires more time to assemble at certain regulated splice sites , and depending on the elongation rate , such sites can be recognized when transcription is slow , but skipped when transcription is fast ( de la Mata et al . , 2003 ; Eperon et al . , 1988 ; Nogues et al . , 2002 ) . However , no study to date has directly compared the splicing kinetics of pre - mRNAs containing distinct splice sites . Here , we monitored splicing and intron turnover by combining genomic integration of a single reporter gene in human cells , 1144 Cell Reports 4 , 1144 – 1155 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors intron labeling with ﬂuorescent proteins , and spinning - disk confocal microscopy . We successfully measured the lifetime of single introns in the nucleus of living cells , and we show that different types of introns have distinct splicing kinetics depend - ing on their size , splice - site strength , and relative position in the transcript . RESULTS Assay to Visualize Intron Removal from pre - mRNA in Living Cells As a ﬁrst model system , we used the well - characterized human b - globin ( HBB ) gene . The HBB gene has a simple structure composed of two constitutively spliced introns ( Figure 1A ) , and the processes that lead to maturation of its primary tran - scripts have been extensively studied both in vitro and in vivo . In order to make b - globin pre - mRNA visible in living cells , we inserted binding sites for either the coat protein of bacterio - phage MS2 or the antiterminator protein N of bacteriophage l into each intron ( Figures 1A and S1 ) and stably integrated the resulting transgenes into the genome of human host cells . Each MS2 binding site consists of a 19 nt RNA stem loop con - taining a single base change that signiﬁcantly enhances MS2 coat protein binding ( Lowary and Uhlenbeck , 1987 ) , whereas l N binds to a minimal 15 nt RNA stem loop termed boxB ( Franklin , 1985 ) . A cassette coding for 24 tandemly repeated MS2 stem loops or 25 boxB repeats was inserted into either the ﬁrst or second intron , preserving the consensus 5 0 splice donor , lariat branch point , and 3 0 splice acceptor sites . To avoid lack of control over the copy number and position of the inte - grated transgenes , we used a strategy that involves the site - speciﬁc recombinase Flp ( ﬂippase ) . Thus , all cell lines generated in this study have a single HBB gene integrated at the same site in the genome . Transcription of the HBB gene is driven by the human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter , and conditional expression of b - globin is regulated by a system derived from the tetracycline - resistance operon ( TetO ) ( Figure 1A ) . We engineered three isogenic human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK 293 ) cell lines that stably express a single copy of the HBB gene . The ﬁrst cell line expresses a nontagged version of the HBB gene , so in order to have the two introns with approx - imately the same length , we used a HBB variant with a shorter intron 2 ( b - WT D ; Figure S1 ) . The second cell line expresses the HBB gene tagged with l N binding sites in the ﬁrst intron and MS2 binding sites in the second intron ( b - l M ; Figure S1 ) . The third cell line expresses the HBB gene tagged with MS2 binding sites in the ﬁrst intron and l N binding sites in the second intron ( b - M l ; Figure S1 ) . These cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the GFP fused in - frame to either the carboxyl termi - nus of MS2 coat protein ( MS2 - GFP ) or l N protein ( l N - GFP ) . Both fusion proteins contain a nuclear localization signal that conﬁnes the chimera to the nucleus . When the GFP fusion proteins were expressed in the absence of transcriptional activation of the HBB gene by tetracycline , diffuse ﬂuores - cence was detected throughout the nucleus and tended to accumulate in nucleoli . Following transcriptional induction , a ﬂuorescent dot was detected in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 1B ) . To determine whether the insertion of MS2 and l N binding sites in introns interfered with pre - mRNA splicing , we carried out RT - PCR analysis . RNA was isolated from cells expressing wild - type b - globin ( i . e . , devoid of MS2 or l N binding sites ) and cells coexpressing the intronically tagged b - globin variants and MS2 and l N fusion proteins . RNA was reversed transcribed using an oligonucleotide that is complementary to a sequence downstream of the b - globin poly ( A ) site . The resulting comple - mentary DNA ( cDNA ) was then PCR ampliﬁed using primers that speciﬁcally detect spliced and unspliced b - globin tran - scripts ( Figure 1C ; Table S1 ) . This RT - PCR experiment detects transcripts that have not yet been cleaved at the poly ( A ) site and therefore are expected to be close to the gene template . The re - sults indicate that b - globin pre - mRNA molecules tagged with intronic MS2 and l N ﬂuorescent fusion proteins are already spliced while the transcripts are still uncleaved . However , compared with wild - type pre - mRNAs , transcripts containing tagged introns are less efﬁciently spliced . This implies that tagged pre - mRNAs take longer to be spliced and / or that some may fail to be spliced . We next examined the localization of RNAs tagged with MS2 stem loops by ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Cells expressing b - l M transcripts were hybridized with a probe complementary to the MS2 stem loops and a probe com - plementary to the hygromycin resistance gene in the plasmid used for transfection , which reveals the site of integration of the HBB gene in the host genome ( Figure 1D ) . The resulting nuclear dots colocalized , showing that intronic MS2 stem loops are predominantly detected at the transcription site . Cells were alternatively hybridized with a probe complemen - tary to the MS2 stem loops and a probe complementary to full - length b - globin RNA ( Figure S2 ) . We observed precise colocalization of ﬂuorescent dots , indicating that the majority of intronic MS2 stem loops detected in the nucleus are either part of nascent pre - mRNA molecules or correspond to excised introns located in close proximity to the transcription site . The observation that introns appear to be restricted to the tran - scription site is consistent with our previous data indicating that b - globin pre - mRNA is spliced cotranscriptionally ( Custo´ - dio et al . , 1999 ; de Almeida et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , we have shown that splicing - defective mutant b - globin pre - mRNAs are retained at the transcription site ( Custo´dio et al . , 1999 ; de Almeida et al . , 2010 ) . A similar retention mechanism could explain why we do not detect unspliced tagged RNAs in the nucleoplasm . Monitoring the Dynamics of Intron Turnover at the Transcription Site Time - lapse , multiplane , spinning - disk confocal microscopy was used to monitor intron dynamics at the site of transcription . An immediate observation in the recorded movies was that the ﬂuorescence intensity was not constant over time , but rather showed cycles of ﬂuorescence gain and loss ( Movie S1 ) . If the observed increase in ﬂuorescent signal results from binding of MS2 - or l N - GFP fusion proteins to newly synthesized MS2 or l N stem loops , the appearance of a ﬂuorescent dot will require Cell Reports 4 , 1144 – 1155 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1145 Figure 1 .

( legend continued on next page ) 1146 Cell Reports 4 , 1144 – 1155 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors ongoing transcription . We therefore treated cells coexpressing b - l M transcripts and MS2 - GFP with the reversible inhibitor of transcription 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - b - D - ribobenzimidazole ( DRB ) . Fig - ure 1E shows maximum - intensity z - projection images of the b - globin transcription site in a cell before and after treatment with DRB . After the DRB was washed out , the same cell was re - imaged , revealing the reappearance of the ﬂuorescent signal ( Figure 1E ) . Time - lapse analysis of 30 cells indicated that the ﬂuorescence intensity at the transcription site decreased pro - gressively , and the signal was no longer distinguishable from background ﬂuorescence after incubation with DRB for 4 – 5 min . The signal consistently reappeared within 2 – 3 min after the DRB was washed out . These results support the view that the ﬂuorescent signal at the transcription site results from syn - thesis of RNA sequences that bind GFP fusion proteins . Because the arrays of RNA motifs that bind MS2 and l N proteins form stem - loop structures , it is estimated that they occupy a volume of < 250 nm in diameter ( assuming a length of 0 . 3 nm / nt ; see also Gru¨nwald and Singer , 2010 ) . Thus , they should appear as diffraction - limited objects . In order to rigorously quantify the ﬂuorescence emitted from a single transcription site , we developed an image analysis application ( Figure S3 ) to track single transcription sites in three dimensions and quantify their total ﬂuorescence intensity ( TFI ) over time by Gaussian ﬁtting ( Figures 2A – 2C ) . As graphically depicted in Figure 2D , the ﬂuorescence intensity shows ﬂuctua - tions with time , with TFI increasing to a given maximum and returning to background levels . Similar results were observed for the ﬁrst and second b - globin introns labeled with either MS2 or l N - GFP fusion proteins ( Figure S4 ) . Assuming that increments in the ﬂuorescence signal result from de novo transcription of intronic MS2 or l N - binding sites , ﬂuorescence loss could reﬂect either intron excision or release of unspliced RNA from the site of transcription . Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some unspliced RNAs are released to the nucleoplasm , the observation that approximately 50 % of ﬂuorescently tagged b - globin introns are spliced before cleavage at the poly ( A ) site ( Figure 1C ) argues that at least half of the ﬂuorescence - loss events are due to splicing . The First and Second b - Globin Introns Have Different Lifetimes Fluctuations in TFI values measured at the transcription site were visible in most time - lapse series , with signiﬁcant cell - to - cell variation in the patterns of ﬂuorescence gain and loss . Although in some time - lapse series the TFI did not drop to background levels , in many movies the phase of ﬂuorescence loss reached background level ( Figure 2D ) . In light of the recent ﬁnding that in mammalian cells pre - mRNAs are synthesized in bursts ( Chubb and Liverpool , 2010 ) , we consider it most likely that a complete disappearance of ﬂuorescence reﬂects a period of transcrip - tional silence during which introns are excised from all previously synthesized pre - mRNAs . An analysis of time - lapse series with ﬂuctuations around background reveals two types of cycles . The ﬁrst is generally longer than 200 s , reaches high ﬂuores - cence intensity values , and shows a complex pattern of subﬂuc - tuations . The second is much shorter ( typically < 50 s ) and has lower ﬂuorescence intensity values ( Figure 2D ) . Since high ﬂuorescence intensity indicates accumulation of multiple tran - scripts , we sought to estimate how many pre - mRNA molecules were present at the transcription site during each cycle of ﬂuo - rescence gain and loss . For this purpose , we took advantage of spliceostatin A ( SSA ) , a potent splicing inhibitor that induces leakage of unspliced b - globin pre - mRNAs to the nucleoplasm ( Martins et al . , 2011 ) . SSA inhibits splicing in vivo and in vitro by targeting the SF3b complex and blocking the formation of a catalytic spliceosome subsequent to the recruitment of U2 snRNP to the pre - mRNA ( Corrionero et al . , 2011 ; Kaida et al . , 2007 ; Roybal and Jurica , 2010 ) . Live - cell imaging of cells treated with 100 ng ml (cid:1) 1 SSA for 4 – 8 hr revealed a multitude of diffraction - limited objects diffusing throughout the nucleus , and similar results were observed for introns labeled with either MS2 or l N - GFP fusion proteins ( Figures 3A and 3C ; Movie S2 ) . Based on previous studies ( Gru¨nwald and Singer , 2010 ; Larson et al . , 2011 ; Shav - Tal et al . , 2004 ) , we reasoned that the diffrac - tion - limited objects that diffuse throughout the nucleus of SSA - treated cells correspond to individual mRNP particles , each containing a single ﬂuorescently labeled intron . In agree - ment with this view , images of diffusing introns labeled with either MS2 or l N - GFP show single - peaked distributions of ﬂuorescence intensity values ( Figures 3B and 3D ) , indicating that the population of unspliced RNA primarily consists of indi - vidual particles . These observations further demonstrate that if unspliced pre - mRNAs were diffusing away from the transcrip - tion site in untreated cells , they would be detected by our visualization system . In parallel , we determined the TFI emitted by a single GFP molecule . For this , we used either puriﬁed single GFP molecules ( Figure 3E ) or particles containing three GFP molecules synthe - sized in tandem ( Figure 3H ) . Single and triple GFP molecules were adsorbed to the surface of glass coverslips and imaged as isolated diffraction - limited ﬂuorescent objects . Bleaching of GFP molecules was induced by continuous imaging while ﬂuo - rescence intensity was monitored as a function of time ( Figures 3E and 3H ) . Bleaching of single GFP molecules occurred in a single step ( Figure 3F ) , whereas up to three photobleaching events were detected for the triple GFP particles ( Figure 3I ) , as expected assuming that each GFP molecule in the triple particle undergoes independent stochastic bleaching . The distribution of D TFI estimated for single GFP bleaching events is depicted in Figure 3G . The results show that the average D TFI associated with bleaching events on single GFP molecules is similar to the most observed average D TFI corresponding to single bleaching steps in triple GFP particles ( Figure 3J ) . We used the average ( E ) A spinning - disk confocal microscope was used to obtain 4D movies of cells expressing b - globin transcripts tagged with MS2 - GFP in the second intron , andzstacks ofoptical sectionswereobtainedevery60s .

Images were acquired before ( (cid:1) DRB ) and after ( + DRB ) incubation with 75 m M DRB for 2 and 4 min . The DRB was subsequently washed out and 7 min later the same transcription site was reimaged . See also Figures S1 , S2 , and Table S1 .

Fluctuations in Fluorescence Intensity at the Transcription Site For quantiﬁcation of TFI , a z stack of eight optical sections spaced by 0 . 36 m m and centered on the transcription site was recorded at 5 s intervals . ( A ) The diffraction - limited ﬂuorescent dot is visible in the central planes of the z stack as a rotationally symmetric point spread function that is longer along the optical z axis , as expected . Each of the images in these central planes can be ﬁtted by a 2D Gaussian function . ( B ) At each time point , we tracked the position of the transcription site in 3D and determined the plane corresponding to the highest intensity value . ( C ) A 2D Gaussian ﬁt was performed at the plane of highest intensity and the result was plotted as an analytical 2D Gaussian function , the integral of which was deﬁned as the TFI for the transcription site . ( D ) For each time - lapse series , the TFI was plotted over time in line graphs . A sequence of images depicting ﬂuorescence ﬂuctuations in the highest - intensity plane is shown on top of each graph .

In contrast to transcription sites that are relatively immobile in the nucleus , unspliced introns in SSA - treated cells diffuse rapidly throughout the nucleoplasm ( Movie S2 ) .

N 5 % and N 95 % indicate the lower and upper limits , respectively , for the number of GFPs contained within 2 SDs of the average value ( (cid:3) 95 % of values ) . See also Movie S2 . Cell Reports 4 , 1144 – 1155 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1149 D TFI corresponding to the amount of light emitted by a single GFP molecule to calibrate the TFI measurements of single in - trons obtained from SSA - treated cells . The results show that on average , each MS2 - labeled intron binds 30 GFPs and each l N - labeled intron binds 15 GFPs , with distributions ranging between 11 and 50 ( for 2 SDs : 95 % ) for MS2 and between 7 and 23 ( 95 % ) for l N ( Figure 3K ) . This is in very good agreement with the maximum number of GFP molecules expected to bind to a single intron labeled with 24 MS2 stem loops or 25 boxB motifs , taking into account that the MS2 protein binds as a dimer ( Valega˚rd et al . , 1994 ) and that the boxB detection system we used is composed of four copies of l N peptide fused to three monomeric GFP molecules ( Daigle and Ellenberg , 2007 ) . Thus , our quantitative data are consistent with the view that each particle diffusing in the nucleus of SSA - treated cells contains a single ﬂuorescently labeled intron . Having determined the TFI value that corresponds to a single ﬂuorescently labeled intron , we next analyzed cycles of ﬂuores - cence gain and loss that started and returned to background level , and calculated the number of introns present when the TFI reached a maximum . We estimated that the long cycles involve the synthesis of more than ﬁve labeled introns , whereas the short cycles contain only one , two , or three introns ( Fig - ure 4A ) . This suggests that the long cycles result from transcrip - tional bursts that involve initiation by several consecutive polymerases , leading to superposition of multiple pre - mRNAs at distinct stages of their life cycle . Consistent with this view , during a long cycle we typically observe subﬂuctuations in inten - sity corresponding to the synthesis and disappearance of one or more introns . Such ﬂuctuations are not observed in the short cycles . We therefore conclude that the long ﬂuorescence cycles correspond to the time it takes to transcribe and process an asynchronous population of multiple pre - mRNAs . In contrast , the short cycles reﬂect the time it takes to transcribe and excise either a single intron or a group of two to three synchronous introns . Thus , the duration of a short cycle corresponds to the intron lifetime . We measured the duration of the short cycles and found that the most frequent lifetime value was 20 s for the ﬁrst intron and 30 s for the second intron ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . Similar lifetime distributions were observed for introns labeled with either MS2 - GFP or l N - GFP ( Figure S4 ) , indicating that the observed intron kinetics is independent of the ﬂuores - cent labeling technique . These results also argue that the phase of ﬂuorescence loss in the short cycles reﬂects splicing rather than release of unspliced RNAs from the site of transcription . Indeed , if transcripts were released unspliced , loss of ﬂuores - cence for pre - mRNAs labeled on the ﬁrst intron would only occur after transcription elongation through the second intron and last exon ( (cid:3) 2 , 000 nt ) . Thus , if transcripts were released unspliced , cycles of ﬂuorescence gain and loss for the ﬁrst intron should be longer than second - intron cycles . To further conﬁrm that loss of ﬂuorescence is due to splicing and not to release of unspliced pre - mRNA , we sought to directly visualize the dynamics of both b - globin introns simultaneously . We reasoned that if transcripts were released unspliced , then ﬂuorescence associated with the ﬁrst intron should increase before ﬂuorescence associated with the second intron , and both ﬂuorescent signals should decrease simultaneously . Cells expressing the HBB gene tagged with l N binding sites in the ﬁrst intron and MS2 binding sites in the second intron ( b - l M ) were cotransfected with two plasmids : one that encodes l N protein fused to GFP and one that encodes MS2 protein fused to the red ﬂuorescent protein mCherry ( Figure 4D ) . We captured three - dimensional ( 3D ) time series at 5 s intervals following sequential illumination of the sample with the appropriate lasers , and calculated the TFI values . We observed that the green ﬂuo - rescence intensity associated with intron 1 started to increase before the red ﬂuorescence in intron 2 , and then decreased while intron 2 red ﬂuorescence was still increasing or at its maximum ( Figure 4E ) . Similar results were observed in cells expressing the b - M l construct , with intron 1 labeled red and intron 2 labeled green ( Figure 4F ) . These data strongly suggest that intron 1 is excised while intron 2 is still present in the nascent transcript , arguing against release of unspliced transcripts . The Intron Lifetime Differs Depending on Splice - Site Strength and Intron Size To study the effect of splice - site strength and intron size on the splicingkinetics , weintroduced24tandemlyrepeated MS2bind - ing sites in mouse immunoglobulin m ( IgM ) gene reporters ( Fig - ure 5A ) . A single copy of each transgene was stably integrated into the genome of HEK 293 cells through site - speciﬁc DNA recombination . Incontrastto b - globinpre - mRNA , whichcontains strong splice sites and is constitutively spliced , mouse IgM is a regulated splicing substrate ( Tsurushita et al . , 1987 ; Watakabe et al . , 1989 ) . In particular , the intron between exons M1 and M2 containsweak3 0 splice - sitesequencesandrequiresanenhancer located in exon M2 for efﬁcient splicing ( Watakabe et al . , 1993 ) . To determine whether the presence of a weak or strong 3 0 splice site affects the splicing kinetics , we compared wild - type IgM M1 - M2 ( IgM - weakPy ; Figure 5A ) and a mutant constructed by replacing the weak 12 nt polypyrimidine ( Py ) tract of IgM with the U - rich 14 nt Py tract of adenovirus major late promoter pre - mRNA ( IgM - strongPy ; Figure 5A ) . To investigate the inﬂuence of intron size on splicing kinetics , we extended the intron length in the IgM - strong Py construct by inserting fragments derived from the ﬁrst intron of the mouse RNA polymerase II gene before and after the MS2 binding sites ( Figures 5A and S5A ) . Following transcriptional activation of the IgM reporter genes by tetracycline in cells expressing MS2 - GFP , a ﬂuorescent dot was detected in the nucleoplasm corresponding to nascent pre - mRNA ( Figure 5B ) . Because the IgM reporter genes were engineered to encode a cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( CFP ) fused to a peroxisomal targeting signal ( PTS ) at the carboxyl terminus , and the CFP - PTS sequence was inserted in frame with spliced M1 and M2 exons , detection of cyan ﬂuorescence in peroxi - somes conﬁrmed that the pre - mRNAs were correctly spliced and exported to the cytoplasm ( Figure S5B ) . As previously described for b - globin RNA , we carried out an RT - PCR analysis of IgM RNA using for reverse transcription an oligonucleotide that is complementary to the sequence down - stream of the poly ( A ) site ( Figure 5C ; Table S1 ) . This analysis de - tects uncleaved RNAs , which are presumably still attached to the gene template at the site of transcription . Consistent with the ﬁnding that CFP is correctly targeted to peroxisomes , the RT - PCR results conﬁrmed that all types of the tested pre - mRNAs 1150 Cell Reports 4 , 1144 – 1155 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors were spliced . However , the proportion of spliced relative to unspliced RNA differed between constructs , being highest ( > 90 % ) for IgM + 1700 ( Figure 5C ) . Compared with the other constructs , the MS2 array of IgM + 1700 is farther away from both the 5 0 and 3 0 splice sites . This may reduce interference with spliceosome assembly , thereby resulting in higher splicing efﬁciency . Fluctuations in ﬂuorescence intensity at the site of tran - scription were quantitatively analyzed as described above for b - globin pre - mRNA . To estimate the intron lifetimes , we selected Figure 4 .

The results show that IgM introns with weak Py tract have an average lifetime of 43 ± 14 s ( n = 31 ) . In contrast , introns with strong Py tract have a signiﬁcantly shorter lifetime : 31 ± 6 s ( n = 37 ; p = 4 . 3 3 10 (cid:1) 6 ) . As expected , compared with the short IgM pre - mRNA with a strong Py tract , inserting (cid:3) 600 nt upstream of the MS2 array does not signiﬁcantly affect the duration of the discrete cycles of ﬂuorescence ( 31 ± 8 s ; n = 29 ) . These cycles no longer correspond to the full intron lifetime because the time it takes to synthesize the extra 600 nt before the MS2 array is not detected . Insertion of (cid:3) 1 , 000 nt downstream of the MS2 array , on the contrary , results in signiﬁcantly longer cycles of ﬂuorescence ( 49 ± 14 s ; n = 33 ; p = 9 . 6 3 10 (cid:1) 9 ; Figures 6B and 6C ) . We also determined the time elapsed since the ﬂuorescence intensity starts to increase above background until it peaks ( Figure 6D ) and we obtained the distribution shown in Figure 6E . From this , we conclude that RNA polymerase II transcribes the Figure 5 . Visualization of the Intron Located between IgM Exons M1 and M2 ( A ) Illustration of the structure of the IgM transgenes .

Assuming such elongation rates , transcription of the additional 1 , 000 nt present in the IgM + 1700 intron would take 12 – 24 s . Thus , the prolonged ﬂuo - rescent cycles observed for this construct most likely result from the extra time needed to transcribe the longer intron . DISCUSSION We have developed a system that makes it experimentally possible to observe in real time the transcription and turnover of ﬂuorescently labeled introns in living cells with single - mole - cule resolution . By using two different RNA labeling methods , MS2 and l N , we show that transcription and excision of b - globin introns occurs in 20 – 30 s , and that compared with the second intron , the ﬁrst intron has a shorter lifetime . The longer lifetime of the second intron may relate to the fact that intron 2 in b - globin pre - mRNA is a terminal intron , and there is a well - established connection between splicing of terminal introns and 3 0 end processing ( Niwa et al . , 1992 ) . More speciﬁcally , cotranscriptional coupling between splicing of the b - globin last intron , 3 0 end processing , Figure 6 .

In the case of IgM - weakPY and IgM - strongPY constructs , the cycle duration values correspond to intron lifetime ; for IgM - strongPy + 600 and IgM - strongPY + 1700 constructs , the cycle duration excludes time of synthesis of the (cid:3) 600 nt transcribed before the MS2 array .

Cell Reports 4 , 1144 – 1155 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1153 and transcriptional termination has been proposed to allow for a time lag that is important for a check on the integrity of the tran - script before cleavage and release to the nucleoplasm ( Dye and Proudfoot , 1999 ) . In addition to b - globin , we further engineered mouse IgM gene reporters containing a single intron between exons M1 and M2 . When the weak wild - type Py tract was replaced by the strong Py of adenovirus major late promoter pre - mRNA , we observed a mean intron lifetime of 31 s . A signiﬁcantly longer mean intron lifetime ( 43 s ) was measured for the wild - type pre - mRNAs con - taining the weak Py tract , providing direct evidence that splice - site strength inﬂuences splicing kinetics . We found that RNA polymerase II elongates through the DNA sequence corresponding to 24 MS2 binding sites inserted into an intron at rates between 3 and 6 kb min (cid:1) 1 . This is consistent with the previously reported value of 3 . 8 kb min (cid:1) 1 estimated by quantitative RT - PCR after reversible transcriptional inhibition induced by DRB ( Singh and Padgett , 2009 ) . An elongation rate of 4 . 3 kb min (cid:1) 1 was also inferred from computational models of photobleaching data obtained in living cells using a cassette coding for 24 binding sites for MS2 ( Darzacq et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , more recent real - time observations in yeast revealed slower transcription rates in the range of 1 . 2 – 2 . 7 kb min (cid:1) 1 ( Ho - cine et al . , 2013 ; Larson et al . , 2011 ) . In a study using global run - on sequencing , elongation rates were reported to vary as much as 4 - fold ( ranging between 0 . 37 and 3 . 57 kb / min ) at different genomic loci and in response to different stimuli ( Danko et al . , 2013 ) . When we compared the duration of ﬂuorescence cycles for short and long pre - mRNAs with a strong Py tract , we obtained mean values of 31 and 48 s , respectively . Based on the estimated elongation rates , we conclude that the extra time required to transcribe the longer intron is sufﬁcient to account for the observed difference . Thus , our results indicate that transcription can be rate limiting for splicing . This ﬁnding may explain the slow splicing rates , ranging between 5 and 12 min , that have been reported for endogenous long mammalian genes ( Kessler et al . , 1993 ; Singh and Padgett , 2009 ) . It is important to note , however , thatsplicingmaynotalwaysoccurimmediatelyaf - ter transcription of the splice sites . Particularly in the case of alternative splicing , intron excision must be delayed until all se - quences involved in the choice are transcribed . Accordingly , some regulated introns have been shown to be excised after release from the transcription site ( Vargas et al . , 2011 ) , and a morerecentglobalstudysuggeststhatasubsetofsplicingevents are completed only after the polymerase transcribes past the poly ( A ) site , but before the mRNA is released ( Bhatt et al . , 2012 ) . In summary , our work provides a valuable experimental sys - tem that has already proved useful for addressing fundamental questions concerning the dynamic control of pre - mRNA splicing in living cells . We anticipate that improved methodologies for single and double labeling of individual pre - mRNA molecules ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) , and in particular the ability to image endoge - nous RNA ( Lionnet et al . , 2011 ) , will contribute further real - time insights into how speciﬁc regulatory sequence motifs and splicing protein factors inﬂuence intron dynamics and impinge on alternative splicing decisions .
