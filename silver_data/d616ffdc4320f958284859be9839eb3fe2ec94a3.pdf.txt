New fields , with their own techniques , have developed , and the traditional fields have broadened their approach to the point that the classic methods of the past have been supplanted by more refined and useful techniques . There was hardly a field called ‘behavioral science’ , psychology largely was the behavioral sciences . Now , psychology has expanded and developed in a myriad of ways , to the point where ‘behavioral science’ is often the more useful term . Physiological psychology has become neuroscience , covering areas not previously part of psychology . Decision making has become decision science , learning theory has become cognitive science , again exploring problems that were not even considered 40 years ago . Advances in technology have also brought forth a host of new techniques that were not possible in the days of manual or electronic calculators . And with all these changes , there have been corresponding changes in the appropriate statistical methodologies . Refined and refocused statistical methods . . . . The principal aim of the Encyclopedia of Statistics in Behavioral Science is to present accessible , high quality articles that are lively and provide a rich mixture of the technical and practical that will appeal to a wide readership . Entries have been chosen to provide broad coverage of methods and applications in the behavioral sciences . Complete coverage of current statistical methods is provided ranging through confirmatory factor analysis , structural equation modeling , random effect / multilevel modeling , generalised linear models , computationally intensive methods such as the bootstrap , and many more . A timely and accessible reference for all behavioral sciences research and development . . . Encyclopedia of Statistics in Behavioral Science represents an invaluable addition to both the psychological and statistical literature , forming an essential reference work for researchers , educators and students in the fields of applied psychology , sociology , market research , consumer behavior , management science , decision making and human resource management . * taken from the preface BEHAVIORAL GENETICS Shaun Purcell Whitehead Institute Cambridge , MA USA CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS Alexander von Eye Department of Psychology Michigan State University East Lancing , MI USA CLASSICAL TEST THEORY / ITEM RESPONSE THEORY / PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT Ronald K .
