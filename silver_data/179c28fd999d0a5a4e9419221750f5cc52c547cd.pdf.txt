Belmont and David G . Drubin Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 - 3202 Abstract . Actin with a Val 159 to Asn mutation ( V159N ) forms actin filaments that depolymerize slowly because of a failure to undergo a conformational change after inorganic phosphate release . Here we demonstrate that expression of this actin results in re - duced actin dynamics in vivo , and we make use of this property to study the roles of rapid actin filament turn - over . Yeast strains expressing the V159N mutant ( act1 - 159 ) as their only source of actin have larger cortical ac - tin patches and more actin cables than wild - type yeast . Rapid actin dynamics are not essential for cortical actin patch motility or establishment of cell polarity . How - ever , fluid phase endocytosis is defective in act1 - 159 strains . act1 - 159 is synthetically lethal with cofilin and profilin mutants , supporting the conclusion that muta - tions in all of these genes impair the polymerization / depolymerization cycle . In contrast , act1 - 159 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin mutant , and the loss of cytoplasmic cables seen in fim - brin , Mdm20p , and tropomyosin null mutants , suggest - ing filament stabilizing functions for these actin - binding proteins . Analysis of the cables in these double - mutant cells supports a role for fimbrin in organizing cytoplas - mic cables and for Mdm20p and tropomyosin in exclud - ing cofilin from the cables . Key words : actin • dynamics • ATP hydrolysis • yeast • cytoskeleton I n most eukaryotic cells , actin filaments undergo dy - namic cycles of assembly and disassembly . Control of actin filament dynamics is thought to be essential for a wide range of cellular processes , including cytokinesis , cell motility , response to external signals , and establishment and maintenance cell shape and polarity . There are nu - merous regulatory proteins that modulate actin dynamics . However , fundamental to the regulation of actin dynamics is the ATP cycle of actin itself . Actin polymerizes from ATP - bound actin , and the ATP is hydrolyzed subsequent to assembly . The release of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) after ATP hydrolysis destabilizes the filament and promotes ac - tin filament disassembly ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1986 ; Car - lier , 1990 ) . Yeast actin with a single amino acid change of the highly conserved Val 159 to Asn ( V159N ) forms fila - ments that depolymerize approximately three times more slowly than wild - type filaments . The V159N mutant fila - ments also nucleate assembly slightly faster than wild - type , but then assemble at a slower rate . The critical con - centration of V159N actin is more than fivefold lower than that of wild - type actin , suggesting that slow depolymeriza - tion and rapid nucleation dominate the overall effects on filament dynamics in this mutant . The slow depolymeriza - tion of V159N actin appears to be the result of a failure to make the conformational change that normally accompa - nies Pi release ( Belmont , L . D . , D . G . Drubin , and E . Egel - man , submitted for publication ) . Previous studies of how actin filament dynamics are regulated by Pi release have all made use of phosphate analogues , such as BeF 4 or free phosphate , methods that are too non - specific to be used in living cells . Therefore , the act1 - 159 mutant provides an ex - cellent tool with which to probe the role of rapid actin fila - ment dynamics in vivo . The actin cytoskeleton of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is simple but dynamic ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) 1 in this yeast is found in cortical patches and cytoplasmic cables . Assembly of both types of structures is regulated spatially and temporally during bud emergence . The cortical patches are concentrated in the bud , and the cables run between the mother cell and the bud . When the bud is large , the ac - tin patches become depolarized for isotropic growth , and Address all correspondence to David G .

The cortical actin patches move quite rapidly within the plane of the cell cortex at rates of (cid:35) 1 . 5 (cid:109) m / s ( Waddle et al . , 1996 ; Doyle and Botstein , 1996 ) . The relative contri - butions of actin dynamics and actin patch motility to the establishment and maintenance of polarity in yeast have not been established . Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified nu - merous proteins that regulate actin dynamics and organi - zation in yeast . Proteins that increase actin dynamics in - clude cofilin and profilin . Yeast cofilin is an essential protein that is localized to actin cortical patches ( Moon et al . , 1993 ) where it increases the rate of actin filament depoly - merization ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Profilin binds to actin monomers and has been reported to accelerate nucleotide exchange and the addition of actin to the barbed ends of actin filaments ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ; Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) . Deletion of the pro - filin gene in yeast ( PFY1 ) results in a severe phenotype of extremely slow growth , depolarized actin patches , loss of cables , and very large cells that lyse easily ( Haarer et al . , 1990 ) . Proteins that are thought to stabilize actin filaments include fimbrin and tropomyosin . Yeast fimbrin ( SAC6 ) is localized to actin patches and cables and tropomyosin ( TPM1 ) is localized exclusively to cables ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ) . Deletion of the genes that encode either of these proteins results in a loss of actin cables and partial depolarization of patches ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ) . Deletion of MDM20 , a gene required for mitochondrial inheritance , also causes loss of actin cables ( Hermann et al . , 1997 ) . It still remains unclear how these proteins interact with each other and with actin to form a highly polarized , yet dynamic , actin cytoskeleton . Here we use the act1 - 159 mutation to study the role of rapid actin dynamics in yeast and to elucidate the in vivo functions of several of these actin regulatory proteins . Materials and Methods Strains and Cell Culture Standard media and cell culture conditions were used ( Guthrie and Fink , 1991 ) . The strains used in this study are listed in Table I . Construction of Mutations The mutation was constructed as described previously ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ) , and was confirmed in the final haploid yeast strain by sequencing a PCR product from the region containing the mutation . Actin Purification Actin was purified from strains DDY1492 and DDY1495 by DNaseI affin - ity chromatography as described ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) and frozen as G - actin in liquid N 2 . Before experiments measuring ATP exchange , the actin was subjected to an assembly and disassembly cycle as follows . Actin was thawed and immediately polymerized by addition of 0 . 1 M KCl , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 2 mM MgCl 2 . After 45 min , additional KCl was added to a final concentration of 0 . 3 M and the F - actin was sedimented in a Beckman TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Fullerton , CA ) at 90 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 25 (cid:56) C . The F - actin was resuspended at (cid:122) 30 (cid:109) M in G buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT ) , and dia - lyzed for at least 16 h at 4 (cid:56) C against two changes of G buffer . The G - actin was then clarified by centrifugation at 90 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C in a TLA100 rotor . The actin concentration was measured first by absorbance at 290 nm ( e (cid:53) 26 , 600 M (cid:50) 1 ) , and then by densitometry of SDS - PAGE gel bands . The cycled actin was used within 8 h . ATP Exchange ATP exchange was measured by diluting the actin into (cid:101) - ATP ( 1 , N 6 - ethenoadenosine - 5 (cid:57) triphosphate ; Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) , with a final concentration of 20 (cid:109) M ATP , 200 (cid:109) M (cid:101) - ATP , 1 . 6 (cid:109) M actin , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and the appropriate concentration of latrunculin A ( LAT - A ) . The sample was then immediately placed into a thermostatted cuvette at 18 (cid:56) C , and the change in fluorescence was moni - tored ( excitation (cid:53) 360 nm ; emission (cid:53) 410 nm ) . There was a dead time of (cid:122) 4 s between addition of (cid:101) - ATP and recording fluorescence . Fluorescence Staining and Microscopy Phalloidin staining and immunofluorescence were performed as described ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioskop mi - croscope ( Carl Zeiss Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) equipped with a Sony CCD ( Sony Corp . , Park Ridge , NJ ) camera controlled by Northern Exposure Software ( Phase 3 Imaging ) . Patch motility ( see Fig . 6 ) was recorded at 4 - s intervals with shuttering of light between images . Fluorescence inten - sity of phalloidin stained structures in yeast , and actin filament lengths were measured with Image Pro Plus software ( Phase 3 Imaging ) . Fluores - cence intensities were compared by measuring the percent area of a cell that contained phalloidin - stained structures above a defined threshold . Immunofluorescence images of double mutants and patch motility in the presence of LAT - A were collected with a Nikon TE300 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca - 100 cooled CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Bridgewater , NJ ) . Images of patch motility in LAT - A were collected continuously without shuttering . Exposure time was 500 ms per image . Latrunculin A Assays Halo assays to measure sensitivity to LAT - A and actin turnover assays were performed as described ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . For pelleting assays , 4 (cid:109) M actin was polymerized at room temperature for 1 h . LAT - A ( or control buffer ) was added , the samples incubated for an additional hour , and then spun at 90 , 000 rpm for 15 min Table I .

The pellet and supernatant fractions were dissolved in equivalent volumes of sample buffer , analyzed by SDS - PAGE and densi - tometry to determine the amount of G - actin . Western Blots 4 OD units at 600 nm ( 8 (cid:51) 10 7 cells ) of log phase cells were pelleted in a clinical centrifuge and washed with distilled water . 100 (cid:109) l of glass beads and 50 (cid:109) l of 2 (cid:51) sample buffer were added to the cell pellet and this was boiled immediately for 3 min . The sample was then vortexed for 1 min , an additional 75 (cid:109) l of sample buffer was added , and then the sample was boiled for an additional 2 min . The sample was spun for 1 s in a microfuge and the supernatant was loaded onto a 10 % acrylamide SDS gel . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed for actin and tubulin using standard techniques ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Band intensity was quanti - fied by densitometry using an IS - 2000 Digital Imaging System . Endocytosis Assay Yeast cells were grown to an OD at 600 nm of 0 . 25 ( 5 (cid:51) 10 6 cells / ml ) . 2 ml of cells were sedimented at low speed in a clinical centrifuge and resus - pended in 40 (cid:109) l of media . 15 (cid:109) l of resuspended cells were added to 7 . 5 (cid:109) l of 40 mg / ml Lucifer yellow ( Molecular Probes Inc . ) and incubated at 25 (cid:56) C for 2 h . Cells were then washed three times in ice - cold succinate / azide buffer ( 50 mM succinic acid , 20 mM NaN 3 , pH adjusted to 5 with NaOH ) and then resuspended in 6 (cid:109) l succinate / azide buffer . 2 (cid:109) l were placed on a slide for immediate observation . Results The V159N Mutation in Actin Results in Yeast with More Pronounced Cables and Larger Cortical Actin Patches , but Has Only Modest Effects on Actin Cytoskeleton Organization The actin gene with Val 159 mutated to Asn ( V159N ) was integrated by homologous recombination into the genome of diploid yeast cells , and the resulting transformants were sporulated . The phenotypes of haploid progeny expressing only the mutated copy of the actin gene were then charac - terized . Yeast expressing V159N actin ( act1 - 159 ) have a dramatically altered actin cytoskeleton . In wild - type yeast cortical actin patches are concentrated in the bud , and ac - tin cables are aligned along the mother – bud axis ( Fig . 1 a ) . In yeast expressing act1 - 159 , the cortical actin patches are much brighter and many cells appear to have more pro - nounced cables ( Fig . 1 b ) . The images in Fig . 1 , a and b were recorded using identical exposure and gain settings to allow direct comparison of fluorescence intensity of rhodamine phalloidin , which binds specifically to F - actin . In fluorescence intensity measurements of 40 rhodamine phalloidin – stained wild - type and act1 - 159 cells , the act1 - 159 cells had (cid:122) 25 % higher fluorescence intensity . F - actin structures observed by antibody staining also appear to be brighter in act1 - 159 strains compared with wild - type ( see Fig . 8 , a and b ) , suggesting that the increased brightness is not due to enhanced phalloidin binding to V159N actin fil - aments . The actin patches in a heterozygous strain carry - ing one wild - type and one V159N mutant copy of the actin gene ( Fig . 1 d ) also appear brighter compared with a wild - type diploid ( Fig . 1 c ) . However , there appears to be little or no increase in the number or brightness of cables . Despite these effects on the appearance of the actin cy - toskeleton , and those described below , most act1 - 159 yeast were able to develop a polarized organization of their ac - tin cytoskeleton with cortical patches concentrated on the surface of the bud ( see Table II ) . Approximately one - third of the cells had additional patches in both the mother and bud , making the polarity less pronounced . In addition , ap - proximately one - quarter of small - budded cells have depo - larized actin or actin structures that are not clearly identi - fiable as cortical patches or cables . Many of the act1 - 159 cells with depolarized actin are larger and rounder than Figure 1 . Rhodamine - phal - loidin staining of yeast ex - pressing V159N actin .

Bar , 5 (cid:109) m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 142 , 1998 1292 wild - type cells , a phenotype commonly associated with the failure to properly polarize the yeast actin cytoskeleton . Approximately 13 % of act1 - 159 cells appear to have ex - cess cables and these are often not properly organized . These cables frequently extend at right angles to the mother – bud axis , rather than running along the mother – bud axis as they do in wild - type strains . V159N Actin Forms Exceptionally Stable Filaments In Vivo We tested the sensitivity of act1 - 159 strains to the actin binding drug LAT - A using a halo assay in which various concentrations of the drug are pipetted onto a sterile filter disc and placed on a nascent lawn of yeast cells ( Fig . 2 A ) . The size of the halo within which no cell growth occurred was measured to determine the relative resistance to the drug . Haploid yeast expressing V159N actin are fourfold more resistant to LAT - A than wild - type cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . In addition to the halo of complete growth inhibition , a halo of reduced growth was observed for the act1 - 159 strain re - flecting slower growth in lower concentrations of LAT - A . This suggests that while the act1 - 159 mutant is able to tol - erate high concentrations of LAT - A , its growth rate is re - duced by LAT - A , even at concentrations that do not affect wild - type cells . One possible explanation for this effect is that the act1 - 159 strain already has a reduced monomer pool ( see Discussion ) , and the LAT - A reduces it further . One direct explanation for the increased LAT - A resis - tance and the presence of more F - actin would be if act1 - 159 strains contained more actin . However , quantitative immunoblotting revealed that actin levels are indistin - guishable between mutant and wild - type cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . Therefore it seems likely that the biochemical properties of the mutant actin itself are responsible for the increased LAT - A resistance and the increased levels of F - actin ob - served in vivo . Because LAT - A binds and sequesters actin monomers , but does not increase the off rate of actin from filaments ( Coue et al . , 1987 ) , this drug can be used to measure the rate of filament turnover in vivo ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . To measure filament turnover , 400 (cid:109) M LAT - A was added to the media and yeast were fixed with formaldehyde at various time points . F - actin was visualized with rhoda - mine - phalloidin . Consistent with previous reports , there are almost no visible actin structures in wild - type yeast af - ter 2 min in 400 (cid:109) M LAT - A , suggesting very rapid fila - ment turnover . However , in the V159N mutant yeast , actin structures disappear much more slowly , and are still visible in 30 % of cells for (cid:46) 40 min after LAT - A addition ( Fig . 3 ) . Therefore , this mutation appears to result in slow actin dy - namics in vivo . For this conclusion to be valid , the slow kinetics of disas - sembly must not be due to the fact that the mutant starts out with higher levels of assembled actin , and must not be due to reduced affinity of the mutant actin for LAT - A . First , the difference is unlikely to be due simply to the fact that act1 - 159 actin patches contain more F - actin be - cause rhodamine - phalloidin – stained patches are only 25 % brighter than wild - type , yet they take 10 – 20 times longer to fall below the detection limit upon treatment with LAT - A . Two experiments demonstrate that LAT - A binds to wild - type and V159N actin with similar affinity . First , we looked at effects of LAT - A on nucleotide exchange . The Table II .

Actin structures were observed by rhodamine - phalloidin staining . To assess actin polarity , only small - budded cells were counted . Terms are de - fined as follows . Polarized , the majority of actin patches were in the bud ; Partially po - larized , more than half of the patches were in the bud , but there were also many addi - tional patches in the mother , or the patches polarized to the neck instead of the bud ; Depolarized , actin patch distribution was nearly random or the phalloidin staining structures were not easily identified as patches or cables . Figure 2 . LAT - A halo assay and Western blot of actin . ( A ) LAT - A was placed on sterile disks at concentrations of 0 , 1 mM , 2 mM , and 4 mM . These disks were placed on nascent lawns of wild - type ( left ) or act1 - 159 ( right ) yeast and allowed to grow at 25 (cid:56) C for 3 d . ( B ) The concentration of LAT - A required to produce a halo of complete growth inhibition of a given size is fourfold higher in the act1 - 159 mutant compared with wild - type yeast . ( C ) Western blot of an SDS polyacrylamide gel loaded with 3 , 6 , and 9 (cid:109) l of yeast extracts from wild - type and act1 - 159 strains . Actin bands from three separate blots were measured by densitometry . Tubu - lin was measured as a loading control for normalization ( not shown ) . The expression levels of wild - type and V159N actin were the same within an experimental error of 15 % . Belmont and Drubin Effects of Reduced Actin Dynamics In Vivo 1293 ATP bound to monomeric actin exchanges spontaneously with ATP in solution . We compared the rate of ATP ex - change in wild - type and V159N mutant actin by monitor - ing the increase of (cid:101) - ATP fluorescence at 410 nm upon binding to actin . As shown in Fig . 4 A , the rate of ATP ex - change is increased in V159N actin . The t 1 / 2 of ATP ex - change in V159N actin is 15 s , as compared with 100 s for wild - type . 5 – 10 (cid:109) M LAT - A completely inhibits nucleotide exchange on purified wild - type yeast actin . 5 (cid:109) M LAT - A inhibits nearly all nucleotide exchange for both wild - type and V159N actin , and 2 . 5 (cid:109) M LAT - A increases the t 1 / 2 of ATP exchange by approximately twofold for both wild - type and V159N actin ( Fig . 4 B ) , demonstrating that LAT - A binds to wild - type and the V159N mutant actin with simi - lar affinities . The ATP exchange experiments address the interaction of LAT - A with actin monomers in depolymerizing condi - tions . We addressed the binding of LAT - A to V159N actin under more physiological conditions by adding LAT - A to polymerized actin in F - buffer and measuring the amount of actin that was sequestered as monomer . Fig . 4 C shows that the amount of actin sequestered by increasing amounts LAT - A is similar between wild - type and V159N actin . Therefore , the increased resistance of act1 - 159 strains to LAT - A is most likely not due to a defect in LAT - A bind - ing to the mutant actin . The V159N Mutation Results in Slow Growth , Salt Sensitivity , a Defect in Endocytosis and Random Budding We next determined the effects of the V159N mutation on various growth properties . At 25 (cid:56) C , the haploid act1 - 159 mutant strain ( DDY1493 ) has a doubling time of 252 min , as compared with 126 min in an isogenic ACT1 wild - type strain ( DDY1495 ) . The act1 - 159 strain fails to grow on plates containing 0 . 9 M NaCl and grows poorly at 37 (cid:56) C ( data not shown ) , conditions that support growth of wild - type strains . Defects in nuclear segregation and budding patterns are common phenotypes associated mutations that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton . act1 - 159 strains show an increase in the number of binucleate plus multinucleate cells ( 7 % ) compared with wild - type cells ( (cid:44) 0 . 5 % ) . Wild - type diploid yeast exhibit a pattern of bipolar budding , re - sulting in bud scars that are localized to opposite poles of the cell , but act1 - 159 homozygous diploids exhibit a ran - Figure 3 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 142 , 1998 1294 dom budding pattern ( Fig . 5 A ) . We measured fluid phase endocytosis by the uptake of Lucifer yellow . There is a pronounced defect in endocytosis in act1 - 159 strains , dem - onstrated by weaker vacuolar staining after 2 h in Lucifer yellow ( Fig . 5 B ) . A similar endocytosis defect was seen in cofilin mutants , suggesting that rapid actin filament turn - over is required for fluid phase endocytosis ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Cortical Actin Patch Motility Does Not Require Rapid Actin Dynamics Cortical actin patches move rapidly within the plane of the cell cortex . To test whether rapid dynamics are required for actin patch motility we constructed an act1 - 159 strain expressing a fusion between Abp1p , an actin - binding pro - tein that is localized to the patches ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) , and green fluorescent protein ( GFP - Abp1p ) ( Doyle and Botstein , 1996 ) . As shown in Fig . 6 , there is no significant difference in the rates of patch motility between act1 - 159 strains and isogenic wild - type strains . Thus , rapid actin fil - ament turnover is not required for patch motility . Patch motility was recorded at 4 - s intervals , which does not allow the observation of the fastest patch movements ( 1 – 2 (cid:109) m / s ) . Since it is possible that the fastest patch movements repre - sent a mechanistically distinct type of motility , we also wanted to determine if fast patch movement was inhibited in the mutant . We observed 10 wild - type and 10 act1 - 159 cells for 1 min each by direct real - time observation under fluorescence microscopy and counted the number of fast patch movements . In both the wild - type and the act1 - 159 strain we observed a total of 12 fast patch movements dur - ing 10 min of observation , suggesting that fast patch move - ments are also uninhibited in act1 - 159 strains . It has been observed that patches continue to move as they are depolymerizing in the presence of LAT - A . How - ever , it was difficult to document this observation because most patches are not visible by fluorescence microscopy of GFP - labeled patch proteins 1 min after treatment with LAT - A . Because cortical actin patches persist in LAT - A – treated act1 - 159 strains for much longer periods of time than in wild - type cells , we were able to use an act1 - 159 mu - tant to test whether actin polymerization is required for actin patch motility . When 400 (cid:109) M LAT - A is added to act1 - 159 strains to sequester free actin monomers , actin patches continue to move for (cid:46) 90 min after the addition of the drug . Fig . 7 shows actin patch motility in act1 - 159 yeast cells 86 min after LAT - A addition . The low signal to noise ratio of the fluorescence signal is a result of the LAT - A addition . Double Mutant Analysis Provides Insights into Actin - binding Protein Functions In Vivo Because act1 - 159 cells have decreased actin turnover rates and in some cases have more cables than are found in wild - type cells , we tested for genetic interactions between act1 - 159 and mutations or deletions in the genes that en - code cofilin , profilin , fimbrin , tropomyosin , and Mdm20p ( Table III ) . These proteins are thought to drive actin dy - namics or regulate actin cable stability in vivo . We found that act1 - 159 is synthetically lethal with two temperature - sensitive ( ts ) alleles of cofilin that cause a decrease in the Figure 4 . LAT - A binding and ATP exchange . ( A ) ATP exchange was measured by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of (cid:101) - ATP upon binding to monomeric actin . Each measurement was repeated three times , and the t 1 / 2 of V159N actin was 15 s ( 15 s , 15 s , 14 s ) , and the t 1 / 2 of wild - type actin was (cid:122) 100 s ( 100 s , 102 s , 100 s ) . Typical plots of fluorescence are shown . The beginning and end - ing fluorescence levels for wild - type actin are 68 and 80 . The be - ginning and ending fluorescence levels for the V159N actin are 80 and 85 . There is a dead time of (cid:122) 4 s before the first measurement can be recorded , so it is possible that the starting point for the V159N actin is similar to that of the wild - type actin . This would make the value of 15 s an overestimate of the t 1 / 2 of ATP ex - change , because most of the exchange would have occurred in the dead time . ( B ) LAT - A was added to the ATP exchange reactions to a final concentration of 0 , 2 . 5 , and 5 (cid:109) M . The t 1 / 2 of ATP ex - change in 2 . 5 (cid:109) M LAT - A is approximately doubled for both V159N and wild - type actin , suggesting similar affinities for LAT - A . ( C ) Increasing concentrations of LAT - A were added to 4 (cid:109) M po - lymerized actin . After 1 h , the polymerized actin was pelleted and the amount of actin left in the supernatant was quantified ( (cid:115) , wild - type actin ; (cid:109) , V159N actin ) .

In addition , act1 - 159 shows negative growth syner - gism with a fimbrin null mutant ( sac6 (cid:68) ) . In contrast , the temperature sensitivity of a tropomyosin ( tpm1 (cid:68) ) deletion mutant is partially suppressed by act1 - 159 . This is not true for an mdm20 deletion mutant . We also crossed act1 - 159 to a strain with a deletion of the gene encoding Pca1p , a protein proposed to be involved in nucleating actin fila - ment assembly ( Lechler and Li , 1997 ) , and observed no synergistic effects . We next examined actin staining in the double mutants ( when viable ) and single mutant progeny of the same crosses . The sac6 deletion results in depolarized actin patches and loss of cables ( Fig . 8 C ) . The double sac6 (cid:68) act1 - 159 mutant , however , has actin cables of normal num - ber and staining intensity , but these cables are frequently mislocalized ( in the bud or running across the width of the mother ) . This double mutant also has depolarized actin patches ( Fig . 8 D ) . TPM1 deletion results in loss of cables and a slight increase in depolarized actin patches ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ) ( Fig . 8 E ) . act1 - 159 tpm1 (cid:68) double mu - tants have a few structures that resemble cables ( Fig . 8 F ) .

None of the haploid progeny predicted to have in - herited act1 - 159 and either a profilin or a cofilin mutation were viable . Each viable double mutant was grown at a variety of temperatures in parallel with the single mu - tants to determine whether the double mutants had an altered permissive temperature range . All of the act1 - 159 sac6 double mutants were viable at 25°C , but dead at 34°C , whereas all of the resultant single mutants were viable at 34°C . The tpm1 (cid:68) act1 - 159 double mutants were viable at 34°C ( 4 out of 5 ) while the tpm1 (cid:68) alone failed to grow 34°C . Both mdm20 (cid:68) and act1 - 159 mdm20 (cid:68) strains were inviable at 34°C . act1 - 159 pca1 (cid:68) double mutants were indistinguishable from act - 159 mutants . Figure 6 .

Therefore , these structures either are not cables , or in the absence of tropomyosin co - filin is localized to both actin cables and patches . act1 - 159 tpm1 (cid:68) double mutants display a distribution of polarized , partially polarized , and depolarized patches that is similar to that of the act1 - 159 mutant alone . mdm20 deletion strains also lack cables ( Hermann et al . , 1997 ) . act1 - 159 mdm20 (cid:68) double mutants have a few cable - like structures that are recognized by cofilin antibodies , similar to those seen in act1 - 159 tpm1 (cid:68) strains . The act1 - 159 mdm20 (cid:68) dou - ble mutant shows slight depolarization defects similar to the act1 - 159 mutant alone . This analysis demonstrates dif - ferent roles for fimbrin compared with tropomyosin and Mdm20p , even though their deletion phenotypes are sim - ilar . Discussion Characterization of act1 - 159 Strains We have demonstrated by two criteria that act1 - 159 mu - tants have more stable actin filaments than wild - type cells . First , yeast strains expressing act1 - 159 as their sole source of actin appear to have more F - actin than wild - type strains , despite having normal levels of total actin as mea - sured by Western blotting . Second , actin structures in act1 - 159 strains persist for much longer in the presence of LAT - A . Because LAT - A does not accelerate depolymer - ization , but sequesters free actin monomers and prevents reassembly , these observations suggest that monomers are released from actin filaments at a much slower rate in act1 - 159 strains . This could be the result of slower depolymer - ization , longer filament length , or altered interactions with actin regulatory proteins . Biochemical data ( Belmont , L . D . , D . G . Drubin , and E . Egelman , submitted for publi - cation ) suggest that the slow turnover is at least partially due to a slow depolymerization of V159N actin . The ob - servation of increased levels of F - actin that result from slow filament dynamics suggests the actin monomer pool in wild - type yeast is higher than the previously reported value of only 0 . 3 % of the total actin ( Karpova et al . , 1995 ) . The rate of ATP exchange is faster in the purified V159N actin . This is consistent with the predictions one can make from the crystal structure of rabbit muscle actin . The amide group of V159 makes a hydrogen bond with the (cid:103) - phosphate of the bound ATP ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) . The V to N change might be expected to weaken this interac - tion because the pK a of the (cid:97) - amino group of Asn is signif - icantly lower than that of Val . This is consistent with our observation of an increased off - rate of ATP from the monomer . It is possible that rapid nucleotide exchange contributes to the apparent increase in F - actin in act1 - 159 strains , but the reduced dynamics are likely the result of the slow dissociation of monomers from filaments . Endocytosis , Actin Cytoskeleton Organization , and Patch Motility Because act1 - 159 strains have slower actin filament turn - over , this mutant is a useful tool with which to probe the role of rapid actin filament dynamics in vivo . The act1 - 159 strains grow at half the rate of wild - type yeast in liquid me - dia , and are sensitive to high salt , demonstrating the im - portance of actin dynamics for normal growth properties . A severe defect in fluid - phase endocytosis is a pronounced phenotype of act1 - 159 mutants . This observation is consis - tent with previous results with cofilin mutants , and pro - vides further evidence that rapid actin filament turnover is essential for endocytosis ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . More than 75 % of act1 - 159 cells maintain at least par - tially polarized actin cortical patches . This suggests either that selective stabilization of polarized cortical actin fila - ments , and / or destabilization of depolarized actin fila - ments , is not the only mechanism by which actin cytoskele - ton polarity is maintained , or that the residual dynamics of V159N actin are sufficient to establish and maintain par - tially polarized actin patches . The mechanism of actin cortical patch motility remains a mystery . Movement of actin patches by myosin motors is an attractive hypothesis , however , none of the myosin mu - tants tested showed a defect in patch motility ( Waddle et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , a temperature sensitive mutation in the ARP3 gene was reported to disrupt patch motility . The au - thors proposed that patch motility is driven by actin poly - merization , much like the actin based motility of Listeria monocytogenes ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . This possibility is tenable because the Arp2 / 3 complex was recently shown Figure 7 . Cortical actin patches in act1 - 159 con - tinue to move in the presence of LAT - A . LAT - A was added to 400 (cid:109) M , and samples were taken during a 2 - h time period and images were re - corded to assess patch motility using GFP - ABP1 . The cells pictured here had been growing in LAT - A – containing media for 86 min . The top white arrow points to a patch that moves away from the arrow towards the center of the cell . In the cell on the bottom right , the white arrow marks the starting position of an actin patch , and the black arrow points to its final destination . The low signal to noise ratio is due to decreased actin patch fluorescence intensity resulting from sequestration of actin monomers by LAT - A . Frames are 2 - s apart . Bar , 5 (cid:109) m . Belmont and Drubin Effects of Reduced Actin Dynamics In Vivo 1297 to nucleate actin filament assembly ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Welch et al . , 1998 ) . However , we find that the rate of patch motility is normal in the act1 - 159 mutant , suggesting that rapid filament depolymerization is not required for motility . In addition , when observing actin patch motility in this strain , we do not see any tail - like structures akin to Listeria tails . The presence of such tails is predicted if the patches move by actin filament turnover ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1992 ) especially if actin depolymerization is in - hibited ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) as it is in the act1 - 159 mutant . Because actin patches in the act1 - 159 mutant persist for much longer in the presence of LAT - A than they do in wild - type cells , we were able to record patch motility in the presence of this drug . Patches continued to move for up to 2 h in the presence of 400 (cid:109) M LAT - A before depolymerizing . This observation strongly suggests that patch motility does not require new actin as - sembly . Therefore , neither actin assembly nor rapid fila - ment turnover appears to be required for actin patch mo - tility in yeast . Evidence for Actin - binding Protein Functions In Vivo We used the act1 - 159 mutant to obtain novel insights into the in vivo roles of proteins that regulate actin dynamics . The insights from these studies are valuable because many Figure 8 . Immunofluorescence of double mutants . Log phase cells grown at 25 (cid:56) C were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with anti - actin and anti - cofilin antibodies .

Cofilin is localized exclusively to cortical actin patches in wild - type , act1 - 159 , and act1 - 159 sac6 (cid:68) cells , but in the tpm1 (cid:68) act1 - 159 and act1 - 159 mdm20 (cid:68) double mutants , cofilin is seen on struc - tures that look like cables . Bar , 5 (cid:109) m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 142 , 1998 1298 actin - binding proteins have similar in vitro activities , mak - ing it difficult to differentiate between their in vivo func - tions . A powerful approach that can provide insights into the functional relationships between proteins is to make strains with mutations in two genes and observe any syner - gistic effects and compare phenotypes of different double mutant combinations . The synthetic lethality of act1 - 159 with cofilin mutants is consistent with the previously dem - onstrated role of cofilin in increasing filament turnover by promoting disassembly ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . It is interesting that act1 - 159 mutants have a slightly different phenotype than temperature - sen - sitive cofilin mutants . Mutations in the yeast cofilin gene result in cells that have larger cortical actin patches ( Lap - palainen and Drubin , 1997 ) , but cytoplasmic cables appear unaffected . In contrast , while the act1 - 159 mutation also results in larger cortical actin patches , there is an addi - tional phenotype of an increase in the number and appar - ent size of actin cables in (cid:122) 13 % of cells . This observation supports the conclusion that actin cables normally turn over dynamically ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) , and suggests that cable stability is determined by different factors from those that regulate actin patch stability . The in vivo role of profilin is less clear and we have used the act1 - 159 mutant to gain new insights into its role in yeast . Profilin is a small protein capable of sequestering actin monomers , increasing the actin monomer pool , and accelerating the addition of actin monomers to filament barbed ends ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) . The role of profilin appears to differ between cell types , acting either to sequester monomers and inhibit assembly , or to pro - mote assembly at specific sites within a cell ( Sun et al . , 1995 ) . act1 - 159 mutant strains are predicted to have a smaller actin monomer pool , based on the observation of an increase in rhodamine - phalloidin fluorescence intensity in situ . Therefore , the simplest interpretation of the ob - served synthetic lethality between act1 - 159 and pfy1 mu - tants is that yeast need to maintain a monomer pool of a certain size to allow rapid assembly of new actin filaments , and are unable to do so with the combination of a hyper - stable actin and an impaired monomer binding protein . However , the pfy1 - 111 mutant has no demonstrated defect in actin monomer binding , making this interpretation un - likely . pfy1 - 111 has a defect in binding to PIP 2 , and pfy1 - (cid:68) 4C has a defect in binding to polyproline , as well as a slight defect in binding to actin ( Haarer et al . , 1993 ) . PIP 2 binding displaces actin from profilin ( Lassing and Lind - berg , 1985 ) , and polyproline binding is thought to localize profilin to sites of filament assembly . Therefore , both of these mutants are predicted have defects in promoting po - larized actin assembly . The defects in pfy1 - 111 and pfy1 - (cid:68) 4C single - mutant strains are subtle . There is a slight de - polarization of actin at higher temperatures as well as a decrease in cable staining ( data not shown ) . Despite the subtlety of the single - mutant phenotypes , both profilin mutants are lethal in combination with act1 - 159 . This is consistent with a model in which organization of the actin cytoskeleton involves both polarized assembly as well as polarized disassembly . Individually the mutations have only slight defects in actin organization , but if polarized as - sembly as well as disassembly are inhibited the effects are more severe . To investigate the regulation of actin cables , we crossed act1 - 159 to tropomyosin ( TPM1 ) , MDM20 and fimbrin ( SAC6 ) deletion strains . Because absence of these pro - teins results in partial or complete loss of cables , we thought that deletions of TPM1 , MDM20 , or SAC6 might suppress the act1 - 159 phenotype ( or vice versa ) . In the sac6 (cid:68) act1 - 159 double mutant the intensity of cable stain - ing is returned to near wild - type levels . However , these yeast are more temperature sensitive than either of the parents . The cables are often mislocalized , either running across the width of the mother , or residing entirely within the bud . These mislocalized cables usually terminated at or near depolarized patches , suggesting a functional link between patch and cable organization . One model to ex - plain these data is that having mislocalized cables is more deleterious than having no cables at all , and that fimbrin might have a roles in both stabilizing cables and directing their orientation . The tpm1 (cid:68) act1 - 159 double mutant also has some cable - like structures , and these cables are prop - erly oriented . In this case , the temperature sensitivity of the tpm1 (cid:68) mutant is partially suppressed by act1 - 159 , sug - gesting that the temperature sensitivity of the tpm1 (cid:68) is caused , at least in part , by the destabilization of actin fila - ments . Interestingly , the actin cables in the tpm1 (cid:68) act1 - 159 double mutants are recognized by antibodies raised against cofilin , a protein normally localized exclusively to patches . The mdm20 (cid:68) act1 - 159 double mutant also has ca - bles that can be stained by cofilin antibodies . The data for the mdm20 (cid:68) and tpm1 (cid:68) double mutants with act1 - 159 are consistent with the model that cofilin is normally excluded from the cables by Tpm1p ( and perhaps Mdm20p , al - though Mdm20p localization is not known ) . Tpm1p could stabilize actin cables both by direct filament binding and by excluding cofilin , an actin filament depolymerizing pro - tein , from actin cables . This is consistent with biochemical studies that showed tropomyosin can partially protect ac - tin from the depolymerizing activity of ADF ( Berstein and Bamburg , 1982 ) . The act1 - 159 mutation has a semi - dominant effect in heterozygotes carrying one wild - type ( ACT1 ) and one mu - tant ( act1 - 159 ) copy of the actin gene . The actin patches in these heterozygotes are bigger and more numerous than in ACT1 / ACT1 homozygotes , although overall actin organi - zation is fairly normal . The two most likely explanations for the semi - dominant effect are ( a ) there are exception - ally stable filaments composed only of V159N actin , or ( b ) this actin co - assembles with the wild - type actin and in - creases the stability of the mixed polymer . Regardless of the mechanism , the fact that the V159N mutation has a semi - dominant phenotype promises to make this actin mu - tation useful for the study of the role of actin filament dy - namics in more complex organisms that have multiple ac - tin genes , or for which gene replacement experiments are not possible .
