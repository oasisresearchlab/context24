Mast cells , can be activated directly by pathogens through a family of pattern recog - nition receptors called (cid:2)(cid:2)Toll - like receptors(cid:3)(cid:3) ( TLRs ) . In particular , TLR2 and 4 seem to be crucial to the response to pathogens . Rodent mast cells respond to LPS through their TLR4 s by the release of pro - inflammatory cytoki - nes without concurrent degranulation or degranulate following peptidoglycan ( PGN ) challenge through a TLR2 - mediated pathway [ 1 ] . As part of an ongoing study to assess the anti - in - flammatory properties of novel chemical entities , LPS was used to activate the rat basophilic leukaemia mast cell line , RBL - 2H3 , that has been reported to secrete IL - 13 and TNF - a after smooth LPS ( sLPS ) stimulation [ 2 ] . PGN was also used to induce activation . Materials and methods Cell culture RBL - 2H3 cells were cultured in a - MEM supplemented with 100 U / ml penicillin - streptomycin and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( GIBCO , Pais - ley , UK ) at 5 % CO 2 and 37 8 C . Cells were subcultured using trypsin - EDTA ( GIBCO ) when reaching 80 % confluency . Ratperitoneal mast cell ( RPMC ) isolation and purification RPMC were isolated as previously described [ 3 ] and purified using a Percoll density gradient [ 4 ] . Cytokine assay RBL - 2H3 cells were plated at 0 . 6 – 1 . 4 x 10 5 cells / cm 2 . Cells were in - cubatedovernightin the presenceof 0 . 1 – 1 m g / ml of sLPS , ( Escherichia coli 011 : B4 ) ( Sigma , Dublin , Ireland ) . Levels of TNF - alpha and IL - 13 were measured in RBL - 2H3 cells(cid:3) supernatants by ELISA ( Biosource , Nivelles , Belgium ) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) Total RNA was isolated from RBL - 2H3 and purified RPMC using an RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Crawley , UK ) . A nitrocellulose spin column was used to avoid heparin contamination of the RNA specimens [ 5 ] . Total RNA was treated with a TURBO DNA - free kit ( Ambion , Lon - don , UK ) to remove contaminating genomic DNA . The RNA prepa - ration was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit ( Bioline , London , UK ) . Primers ( MWG - Biotech Ebersberg , Germa - ny ) , were designed on Rattus norvegicus genes using Primer3 software ( http : / / fokker . wi . mit . edu / primer3 / input . htm ) . Sequences for PCR pri - mer pairs , annealing temperatures , size of the transcripts and cycling conditions are shown in Table 1 . Product ( 10 m l ) was run on a 2 % aga - * Correspondence to : N .

Results and discussion Smooth LPS failed to produce a cytokine response in RBL - 2H3 cells . IL - 13 release was approximately 39 . 1 (cid:2) 24 . 9 pg / ml and was not statistically different from the untreated control ( 35 . 1 (cid:2) 29 . 5 pg / ml ) . The amount of TNF - a released was almost zero , ( Fig . 1A and B ) . In contrast the amount of TNF - a released from cells har - vested by rat peritoneal lavage was approximately 500 pg / ml ( data not shown ) . PGN ( 0 . 1 and 100 m g / ml ) failed to promote the release of the granular enzyme b - hexosaminidase . TLRs expression pattern in RBL - 2H3 cells was in - vestigated by assessing the presence of mRNA transcripts by RT - PCR . Transcripts for TLRs 3 4 5 6 were detected . While the lack of TLR2 explains the unresponsiveness to PGN , the presence of TLR4 transcripts belies the lack of response seen with sLPS . The same phenomenon has been described in basophils by Bieneman et al . [ 6 ] . Ac - cording to these authors , the unresponsiveness of baso - phils to sLPS is due to the lack of the TLR4 co - receptor CD14 . A preliminary study using FACS analysis was perfor - med in order to asses the TLR4 and CD14 surface ex - pression in RBL - 2H3 cells . While TLR4 presence was confirmed , CD14 seemed to be absent . This result might explain the unresponsiveness of RBL - 2H3 in our expe - rimental conditions . However it is inconsistent with pre - viously published data [ 2 ] . Therefore we need to further investigate this aspect of RBL - 2H3 behaviour . The lack of response to sLPS and the lack of TLR2 , challenge RBL - 2H3 as an in vitro model to study mast cell biology .
