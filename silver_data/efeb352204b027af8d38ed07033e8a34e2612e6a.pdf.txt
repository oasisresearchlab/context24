Dysregula - tion of cell motility leads to pathological conditions , such as tumour invasion and metastasis . Accumulating evidence has revealed that extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) signalling is one of the critical regulators of cell motility , although it is classically known as an important regulator of cell proliferation , differentiation and survival through regulation of gene expression . ERK and its downstream kinase , p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) , dynamically regulate cell motility mainly through direct phosphorylation of various mol - ecules that are not necessarily involved in the regulation of gene transcription and translation . In this review , we summarize how ERK signalling regulates cell motility by focusing on the components of the cell motility ma - chinery that are directly regulated by ERK or RSK .

Cell motility is required for diverse cellular processes , such as embryogenesis , inﬂammatory response and wound healing ( 1 ) . Cell motility is regulated by spatio - temporally controlled processes : the formation of a cell protrusion at the leading edge of the cell ; formation and disruption of cell - matrix adhesions ; cell retraction in the retracting tail ; and polarized exocytosis and ves - icle trafﬁcking ( Fig . 1 ) . Among the various intracellu - lar signalling pathways that regulate these processes , extracellular signal - regulating kinase ( ERK ) signalling has been considered one of the crucial regulators of cell motility . In addition to cell motility , ERK signalling also plays critical roles in the regulation of various cellular functions , including cell proliferation , differen - tiation and survival in response to extracellular cues ( 2 , 3 ) . In addition to its relatively ‘classical’ roles in cell regulation , accumulating evidence has revealed that ERK signalling also regulates cell motility through the phosphorylation of various components that are involved in the cell motility machinery . Consistent with the divergent roles of ERK signalling in cell regulation , constitutive activation of ERK sig - nalling results in tumour formation and progression ( 4 (cid:2) 6 ) , and thus inhibition of ERK signalling is widely thought to be a promising strategy for cancer therapy ( 7 , 8 ) . Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which ERK signalling regulates cell motility remain to be fully understood , here we review the current understanding of such mechanisms by focusing on the known target molecules of ERK signalling that are involved in the regulation of cell motility . ERK Signalling The ERK signalling pathway is a prototypic mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signalling cascade that consists of three classes of protein kinases : the MAPK kinase kinase ( MAP3K ) Raf , the MAPK kinase ( MAP2K ) MEK ( MAPK / ERK kinase ) and the MAPK ERK . ERK signalling is activated in re - sponse to growth factors ( GFs ) and the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) through their binding to receptor Fea t u r e d A r t i c l e J . Biochem . 2017 ; 162 ( 3 ) : 145 – 154 doi : 10 . 1093 / jb / mvx048 (cid:2) The Authors 2017 . Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Japanese Biochemical Society . All rights reserved 145 tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) and integrins , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . Activated ERK translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene expression through direct phos - phorylation of various nuclear proteins , including transcription factors ( TFs ) ( 9 , 10 ) . ERK also phos - phorylates and activates downstream kinases , includ - ing p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) , mitogen - and stress - activated kinase ( MSK ) and MAPK - interacting kinase ( MNK ) ( 11 (cid:2) 13 ) . The MSK nuclear kinase mainly regulates gene transcription through phosphor - ylation of nuclear proteins , such as TFs , high - mobility group nucleosome binding domain 1 ( HMGN1 ) and histone H3 ( 11 ) . MNK is a cytoplasmic kinase that mainly regulates mRNA translation through phos - phorylation of cytosolic proteins , such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( eIF ) 4E ( 12 , 13 ) . Compared with MSK and MNK , RSK plays more divergent roles in both the nucleus and cytoplasm ; it phosphorylates various TFs in the nucleus and phos - phorylates the 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 and eIF4B in the cytoplasm , thereby controlling both tran - scription and translation ( 11 ) . RSK also phosphoryl - ates various proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation , survival , metabolism and motility . ERK Signalling and Cell Motility The role of ERK signalling in the regulation of cell motility was initially revealed by experiments in which the activity or expression of MEK or ERK was modulated . Blockade of ERK signalling by spe - ciﬁc MEK inhibitors , such as PD98059 and PD184352 , the expression of a dominant negative mutant of MEK , or the knockdown of MEK or ERK prevents GF - and ECM - induced cell motility ( 14 (cid:2) 19 ) . In con - trast , the expression of a constitutively active mutant of MEK promotes cell motility ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . On one hand , the role of ERK signalling in cell mo - tility depends on its function in regulating gene expres - sion . Overexpression and / or gain - of - function mutation of genes encoding the upstream components of ERK signalling , such as RTKs , Ras and Raf , trigger the constitutive activation of ERK signalling and lead to tumourigenesis , tumour invasion and metastasis ( 4 (cid:2) 6 ) . In this context , ERK signalling promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which is a genetic program to produce motile mesenchymal cells from polarized epithelial cells ( Fig . 3 ) . EMT is driven by EMT - inducing TFs , including Snail [ also known as Snail family transcriptional repressor 1 ( SNAI1 ) ] , SNAI2 ( also known as Slug ) , twist basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor 1 ( TWIST1 ) and zinc ﬁnger E - box binding homeobox 1 and 2 ( ZEB1 / 2 ) ( 20 ) . ERK signalling directly or indirectly modulates expression and function of SNAI2 / Slug , TWIST1 and ZEB1 / 2 , and thus induces expression of pro - motile and Fig . 2 Upstream and downstream of ERK signalling . ERK signalling is activated by extracellular cues , such as growth factors ( GF ) and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) through binding receptor tyrosine kin - ases ( RTK ) and integrins , respectively . Upon activation of ERK signalling , ERK , RSK and MSK regulate gene transcription in the nucleus ( left , blue arrows ) ; RSK and MNK promote mRNA trans - lation in the cytoplasm ( right , blue arrows ) ; and ERK and RSK directly phosphorylate various cytoplasmic substrates ( centre , red arrows ) .

The regulation of pro - motile and pro - invasive gene expression ( blue arrows ) and the structural and functional regulation of the cell motility machinery ( red arrows ) are mediated by ERK and RSK .

Cell motility is spatiotempo - rally controlled by cell protrusion at the leading edge ( light yellow ) , dynamic regulation of cell (cid:2) matrix adhesions ( dark grey ) , cell re - traction in the retracting tail ( light grey ) and polarized exocytosis and vesicle trafﬁcking ( white open circles ) . Cellular structures that regulate each aspect of cell motility are shown in italics below the boxed labels . S . Tanimura and K . Takeda 146 pro - invasive genes that promote cell motility ( 21 (cid:2) 24 ) ( Fig . 3 , blue arrows ) . On the other hand , ERK signalling regulates cell motility in a manner independent of its regulatory function on gene expression . As summarized in a pre - vious review ( 25 ) and described below , ERK and RSK directly phosphorylate various components that regu - late cell protrusion and retraction , cell - matrix adhesion and exocytosis , all of which are necessary for coordi - nated cell motility ( Figs 2 and 3 , red arrows and Table I ) . This direct role of ERK signalling in cell motility is strongly supported by the ﬁndings that acti - vated ERK localizes not only to the nucleus but also to cell protrusions and cell - matrix adhesion sites ( 26 , 27 ) . Cell Protrusion Cell protrusions are formed by the extension of lamel - lipodia and ﬁlopodia at the leading edge of cells in response to motility stimuli ( Fig . 1 , light yellow ) . Lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia are wide sheet - like and needle - like structures , respectively , and both consist of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) and actin - associated proteins ( 28 , 29 ) . Two actin nucleation factors , a seven - subunit protein complex called the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 and Arp3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 complex ) and a family of proteins called formins , nucleate branched F - actin meshwork and linear F - actin , re - spectively , in the lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia ( 30 ) . Although the Arp2 / 3 complex itself has only weak actin nucleation activity , its activity is increased by its interaction with nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) ( 30 ) . NPFs are divided into two classes : class I and class II NPFs . Class I NPFs are further divided into ﬁve sub - classes : Wiskott (cid:2) Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and neural WASP ( N - WASP ) ; WASP - family verprolin homolog ( WAVE ) ; WASP and SCAR homolog ( WASH ) ; WASP homolog associated with actin , mem - branes and microtubules ( WHAMM ) ; and junction - mediating regulatory protein ( JMY ) . A major member of the class II NPFs is cortactin . In addition to the actin nucleation factors , actin elongation factors , such as Enabled ( Ena ) / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) family proteins , regulate the extension of lamel - lipodia and ﬁlopodia . These factors bind to the barbed ends of F - actin and prevent actin capping proteins that terminate F - actin elongation by binding F - actin ( 31 ) . Formins also function as actin elongation factors ( 30 ) . The Rho family GTPases , Rac , Cdc42 and Rho , play a pivotal role in cell motility ( 32 ) . These factors cycle between GTP - bound active states and GDP - bound inactive states , and active GTPases interact with and regulate the activity and localization of ef - fector molecules ( 33 ) . Rho family GTPases promote actin polymerization by activating actin nucleation fac - tors and extend cell protrusions by increasing the for - mation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia ( 30 ) . For instance , Cdc42 directly interacts with and activates class I NPFs , WASP and N - WASP , whereas Rac in - directly activates WAVE . Rho and Cdc42 activate the mammalian homolog of Drosophila diaphanous 2 Table I .

In addition , Rho family GTPases modulate the formation of cell protru - sions by activating serine / threonine kinases ( 32 ) . Rac and Cdc42 activate p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) , which in turn phosphorylates and activates LIM ( Lin - 11 , Isl1 and Mec - 3 ) kinase ( LIMK ) . LIMK phosphorylates and inhibits coﬁlin , a family of actin - binding proteins that have F - actin severing activity . PAK also phos - phorylates and activates ﬁlamin A , one of the F - actin crosslinking proteins , promoting lamellipodial forma - tion ( 34 ) . WAVE2 and Abi1 When WAVE promotes actin nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , WAVE needs to form a large com - plex called the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , which scaffolds actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 30 , 35 ) . Among the three members of the WAVE family ( WAVE1 (cid:2) 3 ) , ERK directly phosphorylates WAVE2 at S343 , T346 and S351 . ERK also phosphor - ylates Abl - interactor 1 ( Abi1 ) , a component of the WRC , at multiple sites ( 36 (cid:2) 38 ) . These phosphoryl - ations are required for the interaction of WRC with the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin , indicating that ERK promotes WAVE2 - mediated actin polymerization . A previous study also showed that phosphorylation of WAVE2 by ERK regulates polarization of the Golgi apparatus , which facilitates polarized exocytosis and vesicle trafﬁcking , as described below , and may pro - mote persistent cell motility ( 36 ) . Cortactin Cortactin , a class II NPF , consists of an N - terminal acidic domain , 6 . 5 tandem repeats of a 37 - amino acid sequence , a proline - rich ( PR ) region and a C - terminal Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( 30 ) . Cortactin interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex through its acidic domain and enhances the actin nucleation activity of the com - plex . Cortactin also interacts with class I NPFs , WASP and N - WASP , through the SH3 domain , resulting in synergic activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by cortactin and WASP / N - WASP . ERK phosphorylates cortactin at S405 and S418 within the PR region , promoting the interaction of cortactin with WASP / N - WASP ( 39 ) . In contrast , Src family kinases ( SFKs ) phosphorylate cor - tactin at Y421 , Y470 and Y486 within the PR region , negatively regulating the interaction of cortactin with WASP / N - WASP . These ﬁndings suggest that ERK signalling and SFKs counteract each other in the regu - lation of the cortactin - WASP / N - WASP interaction . However , other studies showed that cortactin is co - phosphorylated at S405 , S418 and Y421 ( 40 , 41 ) . Furthermore , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin has been shown to promote the interaction of cortactin with the adaptor protein Nck1 , which interacts with WASP / N - WASP ( 42 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is not necessarily an ‘off - switch’ for the cortactin - WASP / N - WASP interaction and that ERK signalling and SFKs co - operatively regulate their interaction , perhaps by mod - ulating various combinations of their respective phosphorylation sites . VASP Ena / VASP family proteins contain two Ena - VASP - homology ( EVH ) domains , EVH1 and EVH2 ( 31 ) . Whereas the EVH1 domain interacts with focal adhe - sion proteins , the EVH2 domain mediates homo - and hetero - oligomerization of Ena / VASP family proteins and interacts with both actin monomers and F - actin . Although ERK signalling generally promotes actin polymerization through phosphorylation - dependent regulation of NPFs , as described above , RSK1 , among the four human isoforms ( RSK1 (cid:2) 4 ) , inhibits actin elongation . RSK1 binds and phosphorylates VASP , an Ena / VASP family protein , at T278 , nega - tively regulating the actin elongation activity of VASP ( 43 ) . T278 is located in the EVH2 domain , and thus T278 phosphorylation may inhibit the interaction of VASP with actin and / or the oligomerization of VASP . Whether this isoform - speciﬁc function of RSK1 in VASP regulation operates under the control of ERK signalling remains to be clariﬁed . Interestingly , VASP is also phosphorylated at S157 by cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) ( 44 ) . Although VASP is localized to cell - matrix adhesion sites through the EVH1 domain , phosphorylation of VASP at S157 induces its relocalization to lamellipo - dia , suggesting that both the localization and activity of VASP are regulated by differential phosphorylation by RSK1 and PKA . CdGAP Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) activate GTPases by catalysing the exchange of GDP for GTP , whereas GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) enhance the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of the GTPases . ERK phosphorylates Cdc42 GTPase - activating pro - tein ( CdGAP ) , a speciﬁc GAP for Rac and Cdc42 , at T776 and inactivates its function ( 45 ) . This suggests that ERK promotes the formation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia by activating Rac and Cdc42 at the lead - ing edge . Rac1 Among the three isoforms of Rac ( Rac1 (cid:2) 3 ) , Rac1 is phosphorylated at T108 by ERK ( 46 ) . T108 phosphor - ylation inhibits Rac1 activity , probably by inhibiting its interaction with phospholipase C - g 1 , which func - tions as a GEF for Rac1 ( 47 ) . In addition , T108 phos - phorylation targets Rac1 to the nucleus , which isolates Rac1 from other GEFs , such as Tiam1 and Vav ( 33 ) . Considering that Rac1 accumulates in the nucleus during the G 2 phase of the cell cycle and promotes cell division ( 48 ) , Rac1 might be an effector molecule when ERK signalling needs to preferentially promote cell proliferation rather than cell motility . MLCK Myosin II interacts with F - actin and generates the acto - myosin contractile force for cell motility . The ac - tivity of myosin II is mainly controlled by its regula - tory light chain ( MLC ) , which is regulated by MLC kinase ( MLCK ) in a manner dependent on its kinase activity ( 49 ) . Activated MLCK is localized to the lead - ing edge of cells but not to the retracting tail , S . Tanimura and K . Takeda 148 suggesting that MLCK - mediated acto - myosin con - tractile force promotes lamellipodia extension ( 50 , 51 ) . ERK phosphorylates and activates MLCK , which in turn phosphorylates MLC and activates myosin II ( 14 , 52 ) . This represents a mechanism by which ERK signalling controls cell motility . However , how ERK regulates MLCK activity , includ - ing the phosphorylation site ( s ) in MLCK targeted by ERK , remains unknown . SH3P2 SH3 domain - containing protein 2 ( SH3P2 ) was origin - ally identiﬁed as one of the proteins that contain an SH3 domain ( s ) but have no known function ( 53 ) . Our group revealed that SH3P2 suppresses cell motility and that its inhibitory effect on cell motility is suppressed by direct phosphorylation of S202 within the C - ter - minal region by RSK ( 54 ) . We further found that SH3P2 speciﬁcally interacts with type 1 myosin , called myosin 1E ( Myo1E ) , in unstimulated cells ( 55 ) . When cells are stimulated with serum or GFs , RSK phosphorylates SH3P2 at S202 and dissociates Myo1E from SH3P2 ( Fig . 4 ) . Because the C - terminal region around S202 in SH3P2 is required for its inter - action with Myo1E , the phosphorylation - induced con - formational change of SH3P2 appears to interfere with the interaction . Interestingly , whereas the SH3P2 - Myo1E complex is localized in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells , Myo1E released from S202 - phos - phorylated SH3P2 immediately translocates to lamelli - podial tips . A general feature of type 1 myosins is the ability to interact with F - actin and cell membrane through the motor and tail domains , respectively ( 56 ) . This enables type 1 myosins to function as crosslinking proteins that connect and generate force between F - actin and the cell membrane . SH3P2 has been shown to interact with the tail domain , i . e . the membrane (cid:2) interaction interface , of Myo1E , suggesting that SH3P2 prevents the recruitment of Myo1E to lamellipodial tips . Myo1E possesses an SH3 domain in its C - terminus through which it interacts with several proteins , includ - ing N - WASP and dynamin ( 57 , 58 ) . Although dyna - min is a GTPase responsible for endocytosis , it also functions together with cortactin to promote actin polymerization at the leading edge of cells ( 59 ) . Myo1E may promote lamellipodia extension and cell motility by transporting such proteins as cargo to la - mellipodial tips . Other substrates of RSK involved in cell protrusion RSK phosphorylates two types of proteins , ﬁlamin A and plastins , that regulate the F - actin network . Filamin A is a high - molecular weight dimeric protein with an N - terminal actin - binding domain ( ABD ) and serves as an F - actin crosslinking protein ( 60 ) . As described above , PAK phosphorylates ﬁlamin A , and phosphorylated ﬁlamin A promotes lamellipodia for - mation ( 34 ) . RSK also phosphorylates ﬁlamin A at S2152 , which is the same site phosphorylated by PAK , suggesting that RSK enhances lamellipodia for - mation through ﬁlamin A phosphorylation ( 61 ) . However , how phosphorylation of ﬁlamin A at S2152 affect lamellipodia formation remains to be determined . One plausible explanation is that S2152 phosphorylation of ﬁlamin A may regulate binding to and / or activity of one or some of its many binding partners ( 34 , 61 ) . Plastins are actin - binding proteins with two ABDs through which they bundle F - actin . Among the three plastin isoforms in vertebrates ( T - / I - / L - plastin ) , L - plastin is expressed in hematopoietic lineage cells and often overexpressed in tumours ( 62 ) . RSK phosphorylates L - plastin at S5 , and this phos - phorylation enhances the actin - bundling activity of L - plastin and targets L - plastin to ﬁlopodia and cell - matrix adhesion sites ( 63 ) . Phosphorylation at S5 is suggested to induce a conformational change of L - plastin , which may facilitate the association of its ABDs with F - actin ( 64 ) . EphA2 is a member of the Eph RTK family that regulates tissue development and homeostasis ( 65 ) . EphA2 also regulates growth factor - induced cell mo - tility in a manner independent of its tyrosine kinase activity . In response to inﬂammatory cytokines , RSK phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of EphA2 at S897 . S897 - phosphorylated EphA2 localizes to lamellipodia , and inhibition of this phosphorylation suppresses cell motility ( 66 ) . However , the mechanism by which EphA2 regulates cell motility depending on its phos - phorylation status at S897 is still largely unknown . Cell (cid:2) Matrix Adhesion Cell (cid:2) matrix adhesion is the interaction of a cell with ECM and guides cell motility ( Fig . 1 , dark grey ) . Different types of cell - matrix adhesion complexes , including focal complexes , focal adhesions and ﬁbrillar adhesions , are formed during cell motility ( 67 ) . Focal complexes are small , dot - like adhesions that are formed at the edge of lamellipodia and serve as pre - cursors of focal adhesions . Focal adhesions and ﬁbril - lar adhesions are elongated structures that mediate strong adhesion to the substrate and usually are formed in the peripheral region and central region of cells , respectively . Cell (cid:2) matrix adhesions are mediated by integrins ( 67 , 68 ) . Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane Fig . 4 Regulation of cell motility by the RSK - SH3P2 - Myo1E axis . SH3P2 interacts with Myo1E and anchors it in the cytoplasm . Phosphorylation of SH3P2 at S202 by RSK dissociates Myo1E from SH3P2 , and released Myo1E translocates to lamellipodial tips and promotes cell motility . ERK signalling as a regulator of cell motility 149 receptors that interact with components of the ECM , such as ﬁbronectin , vitronectin and collagen . The cyto - plasmic tail of integrins directly binds to various pro - teins and indirectly interacts with F - actin . Integrins transduce bi - directional signals between the outside and inside cells . The binding of integrins to ECM and clustering of integrins results in the formation of multiple protein complexes at the cytoplasmic tail of integrins that transduce intracellular signals ( outside - in signalling ) . In contrast , the interaction of intracellular proteins with the cytoplasmic tail of integrins triggers overall conformational changes of integrins , which transduce extracellular signals ( inside - out signalling ) . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and SFKs play a critical role in the formation of multiple protein complexes at the cytoplasmic tail of integrins ( 69 ) . Through the regulation of actin polymerization , Rac and Rho also regulate the formation of focal complexes and focal adhesions , respectively ( 67 ) . FAK and paxillin FAK , a non - receptor tyrosine kinase , is localized to integrin - rich cell (cid:2) matrix adhesion sites ( 69 ) . FAK autophosphorylated at Y397 recruits various SH2 domain - carrying signalling proteins , including SFKs , and forms a complex . Within this complex , SFKs phosphorylate other tyrosine residues of FAK and FAK - associated proteins and create more SH2 domain - binding sites . Thus , FAK and SFKs accelerate the formation of protein complexes that transduce intracellular signals at cell - matrix adhesion sites . Paxillin , a multifunctional docking protein , localizes to focal adhesions , interacts with FAK and is phos - phorylated at multiple residues ( 70 ) . Paxillin plays an important role in regulating cell (cid:2) matrix adhesion and cell motility . ERK phosphorylates FAK and paxillin in focal ad - hesions ( 71 , 72 ) . Phosphorylation of FAK at S910 and phosphorylation of paxillin at S83 decreases and in - creases the FAK - paxillin association , respectively . Considering that paxillin is proposed to be a scaffold protein for ERK signalling ( 72 ) , ERK may initially phosphorylate paxillin and recruit FAK to paxillin . Subsequently , ERK phosphorylates FAK and dissoci - ates it from paxillin , which may contribute to the tem - poral control of the FAK (cid:2) paxillin association . ERK also phosphorylates paxillin at S130 , which induces subsequent phosphorylation of paxillin at S126 by an - other serine / threonine kinase , GSK3 ( 73 ) . Phospho rylation of paxillin at S126 and S130 is required for cell spreading , which depends on the formation of cell protrusions and cell - matrix adhesions . However , the effect of phosphorylation of these sites on the role of paxillin in cell spreading does not appear to rely on the regulation of association of paxillin with its known binding partners , because an unphosphorylatable mutant ( S126 / 130A ) still binds to paxillin - associated proteins , including FAK ( 74 ) . At the leading edge of cells , the dynamic formation and disruption of focal complexes appear to be required for cell motility . Therefore , ERK plays a pivotal role in regulating cell motility through phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin at the leading edge . Vinexin b Vinexin is one of the major focal adhesion proteins that regulates cell spreading and growth factor sig - nalling at focal adhesion sites ( 75 ) . Among several al - ternative forms , vinexin a , b and g have been well characterized as adaptor proteins containing three SH3 domains ( 76 ) . Activated ERK interacts with and phosphorylates vinexin b at S189 , and activated ERK and S189 - phosphorylated vinexin are localized at the leading edge of cells ( 77 , 78 ) . Previous analysis of an unphosphorylatable mutant ( S189A ) and a mutant that mimics phosphorylation by ERK ( S189D ) sug - gested that unphosphorylated vinexin b increases cell spreading and motility , whereas phosphorylated vinexin b decreases these activities . Although the physiological signiﬁcance of ERK - medicated phos - phorylation of vinexin has not been yet revealed , vinexin appears to be an important substrate of ERK in the leading edge of cells when ERK signalling pre - cisely regulates cell motility . Calpain 2 Calpain 2 , a member of the large calpain family , is an intracellular Ca 2 + - dependent cysteine protease ( 79 ) . Calpain 2 regulates cell - matrix adhesion and cell pro - trusion by cleaving proteins that play a role in cell motility , such as integrins , paxillin , FAK , cortactin and SFKs . ERK phosphorylates calpain 2 at S50 , al - though the targeted region in calpain 2 does not match the ERK phosphorylation consensus sequence ( P - X - S / T - P ) ( 80 ) . Phosphorylation of calpain 2 at S50 in - creases its protease activity even in the absence of increased intracellular Ca 2 + . Interestingly , calpain 2 and ERK associate with FAK independently of FAK kinase activity , suggesting that FAK serves as a scaf - fold protein in the complex including calpain 2 and ERK ( 81 ) . Furthermore , MEK kinase 1 , another MAP3K that activates ERK signalling , interacts with FAK and activates calpain 2 through ERK in the FAK - based complex at focal adhesion sites ( 82 ) . Activated calpain 2 cleaves proteins that link focal ad - hesions to the cytoskeleton , such as spectrin and talin , and promotes the turnover of adhesion complexes . Thus , calpain 2 is another critical effector protein that regulates cell motility downstream of ERK signalling . Cell Retraction In the retracting tail of migrating cells , detachment of cell - matrix adhesions and myosin II - mediated contractile force trigger cell retraction , and Rho GTPases , RhoA , RhoB and RhoC , play a major role in this process ( Fig . 1 , light grey ) . Rho activates Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) . ROCK phosphorylates and activates LIMK , and LIMK in turn phosphorylates and inhibits coﬁlin , leading to F - actin stabilization . ROCK also phos - phorylates and inhibits myosin phosphatase , leading to an increase in MLC phosphorylation and cell retraction depending on myosin - based contractile force ( 32 ) . ERK phosphorylates and activates GEF - H1 , one of the Rho GEFs , at T678 , increasing the activity of Rho ( 83 ) . This regulation appears to operate in the S . Tanimura and K . Takeda 150 paxillin (cid:2) ERK (cid:2) GEF (cid:2) H1 complex formed in focal ad - hesions in response to stretch stimulation ( 84 ) . In con - trast , ERK phosphorylates ( either directly or indirectly ) and activates deleted in liver cancer 1 ( DLC1 ) , one of the Rho GAPs that localizes to focal adhesions through the interaction with FAK , decreas - ing the activity of Rho ( 85 ) . However , it has not been shown whether phosphorylation of DLC1 by ERK also occurs in response to stretch stimulation . Thus , further researches are necessary to understand how and why ERK exerts its opposite effects on the activity of Rho in focal adhesions . ERK also phosphorylates RhoA itself , though it is also not clear whether directly or indirectly . This phosphorylation of RhoA leads to its ubiquitin - proteasome - dependent degradation ( 86 ) , suggesting that ERK also regulates the protein levels of Rho . The cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1 functions in the nucleus and regulates cell cycle pro - gression ( 87 ) . However , p27 kip1 phosphorylated at T198 by RSK is retained in the cytoplasm ( 88 ) where it binds Rho and inhibits its activity ( 89 ) . p27 kip1 ap - pears to uniformly distribute in the cytoplasm and not to be restricted to speciﬁc regions , such as leading edges and focal adhesions ( 89 ) . Therefore , ERK sig - nalling might suppress the overall activity of Rho through RSK - induced phosphorylation of p27 kip1 , although the signiﬁcance of such regulation is not clear . Taken all into account , ERK signalling may be neither a general activator nor inhibitor of Rho , but rather functions as a spatiotemporal regulator that precisely controls cell retraction in a context - depend - ent manner . Polarized Exocytosis and Vesicle Trafficking Polarized exocytosis and polarized vesicle trafﬁcking have been suggested to regulate cell motility ( Fig . 1 , white open circles ) . In polarized exocytosis , post - Golgi secretory vesicles with newly synthesized proteins are transported from the Golgi complex to the leading edge of cells ( 90 ) . In polarized vesicle trafﬁcking , mem - brane proteins , such as integrins and RTKs , are inter - nalized by endocytosis at the rear of cells and recycled to their leading edge ( 91 ) . Rab , Arf , Rho and Ral family GTPases play pivotal roles in exocytosis and vesicle trafﬁcking by interacting with their respective effector proteins ( 90 , 91 ) . The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein complex that tethers secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane during exocytosis ( 90 ) . Rab , Rho and Ral GTPases interact with and regulate speciﬁc components of the exocyst . ERK phosphorylates Exo70 , a component of the exocyst complex , at S250 ( 92 ) . ERK - mediated phosphorylation of Exo70 pro - motes the binding of Exo70 to other exocyst compo - nents and the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases . This regulation appears to contribute to polarized exo - cytosis in migrating cells because ERK activity is rela - tively high in the leading edge ( 26 , 27 ) . Exo70 phosphorylation also promotes the formation of invado - podia , which is a structure critical for tumour invasion . Consistent with this , ERK - dependent phosphorylation of Exo70 at S250 , as well as phosphorylation of cortactin at S418 , is induced in melanoma harbouring the oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation ( 93 ) , demonstrating the pathophysiological importance of ERK - mediated phosphorylation events in tumour cell invasion . Conclusion and Perspectives This review summarized the roles of ERK signalling in the regulation of cell motility by focusing on the com - ponents of the cell motility machinery that are directly regulated by ERK or RSK ( Table I ) . The most import - ant contribution to our current understanding of this topic is obviously the identiﬁcation of substrate pro - teins . In this approach , mass spectrometry - based phos - phoproteomics analysis , in combination with speciﬁc inhibitory compounds against ERK signalling , has been a powerful tool ( 94 ) . Recent phosphoproteomics studies have revealed novel substrate proteins of ERK and RSK ( 95 (cid:2) 97 ) . However , the identiﬁcation of sub - strate proteins involved in cell motility appears to be rather difﬁcult , because ERK - mediated phosphoryl - ation events in the regulation of cell motility are usu - ally transient and restricted to the area of cell protrusions and / or cell (cid:2) matrix adhesions . Therefore , spatiotemporal phosphoproteomics analyses and those in combination with cell fractionation would be required to identify novel , more important molecules that mediate ERK signalling in cell motility . Further knowledge of the roles of ERK signalling in cell mo - tility may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of tumour progression and metastasis and contribute to effective cures for cancer .
