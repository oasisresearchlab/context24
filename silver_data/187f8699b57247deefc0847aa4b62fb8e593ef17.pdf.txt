Social Justice and Design : Power and oppression in collaborative systems Abstract The study of power and oppression is and has always been integral to CSCW research . From studies of less visible forms of maintenance practice to understanding the effects of categorization on users of social media , scholars highlight the ways in which certain publics are marginalized through systems that purport to serve them . Alongside this , researchers taking up participatory action research approaches and interventionist modes of inquiry have begun to question these arrangements , through design oriented projects . This panel brings together CSCW scholars active in theorizations and enactments of design for social justice to examine and debate social change oriented research . Together , they imagine a practice where agendas are made clear and academic institutions , collaborators of field sites , and the scholarly community are mutually responsive and responsible for the outcomes of their research work .

We site our discussion within domains such as labor , movement through on - and offline space , civic engagement , and visions of participatory futures . In reviewing these areas of research , we outline theoretical and methodological approaches that are particularly well - suited to help us consider issues of oppression and access , and which support praxis— scholarship and action directed to transform oppressive structures with and by the dispossessed , marginalized , and oppressed . Finally , we focus on strategies and techniques for social justice research in CSCW , emphasizing the development of community / academic partnerships , our role as interventionists in research sites , and analytic innovation we need to address these issues . Background CSCW has encountered work on power and labor since its beginnings in the 1980s , through an emphasis on participatory design [ 6 ] and ethnographic accounts of photocopier use [ 20 , 26 ] . Drawing on ideas from feminist technoscience scholars Haraway [ 12 ] and Harding [ 13 ] , Suchman , Star and other CSCW scholars suggest effective technical objects get built from the collection of partial and located knowledges [ 24 – 26 ] . Building on this tradition over the past several years , scholars within and just beyond CSCW grapple with the ways in which power permeates collaborative systems beyond traditional work environments . Theoretical and methodological calls [ 2 , 4 , 22 , 27 ] have advocated for feminist modes of inquiry within HCI and postcolonial theory as a means for understanding the centrality of power dynamics always already a part of design research [ 18 , 21 ] . Empirical research has focused on autonomy in defining one’s online identity [ 5 ] , work recognizing the legitimacy of social movements [ 1 , 9 , 14 , 15 ] , and expanding ideas of innovation to acts of repair [ 19 , 23 ] —offering different timescales to technical artifacts and often centering acts of innovation and engineering beyond Silicon Valley . Amid debates on crowdsourcing and machine learning , CSCW has a particularly central role in guiding ethical questions of microwork [ 16 , 17 ] . As a normative discipline , design might seem to have an uneasy relationship to social justice , but in this panel we imagine opportunities for varied engagement with topics of power through material production . Beyond design with good intentions , we suggest understandings of design that might actively contribute to questioning structures of dominance . Here we draw on CSCW’s already existing engagement with action research and participatory design traditions [ 2 , 8 , 9 , 11 ] , alongside speculative approaches that seek “not so much to predict the future , but rather to imagine a radically better one” [ 3 : 198 ] . This panel draws on ongoing conversation on the potentials of social justice and design , contributing to discussions that took place in ( and beyond ) workshops and panels at Design Research Society Conference [ 7 , 28 ] and CHI [ 10 ] . Here , we build on this conversation by focusing on collaborative systems research and by drawing on a legacy of critical and participatory approaches within the field of CSCW . Panel CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 118 Discussion Topics Debates about social justice encompass the ways that design of collaborative systems shape processes at different scales and in different domains . Here , we consider projects on collaborative and distributive work , online and offline social movements , design interventions for politically contentious contexts , and participatory utopic visions . This panel’s goal is to explore how the field of CSCW can critically examine power within and beyond these sites , emphasizing forms of research with transformative agenda . We grapple with the following questions : 1 ) What is our obligation ( if any ) as researchers to highlight or work to change oppressive systems we encounter or inadvertently produce through our work ? 2 ) How do we engage in practices of design for social justice ? With whom do we design and how are appropriate outputs determined ? 3 ) How might we consider “fit” between design methods that are honed in corporate and university environments , and the needs of social justice movements ? What kinds of analytic innovation might we need to address these issues ? 4 ) What types of stories do we tell about the work of design for social justice ? Who tells those stories and who has the opportunity to hear and comment on them ? Panelists Michael Muller ( Chair and Moderator ) works at IBM Research , uses both qualitative and quantitative approaches in his research on human collaboration through technologies . His interest in ethics began with participatory design and ethnocriticism , and then value sensitive design for its inclusion of diverse stakeholders . Michael continues to support feminist , postcolonial , and other critical work in design and analysis . Shaowen Bardzell is Associate Professor of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University . Her research explores the contributions of design , feminism , and social science to support technology’s role in social change . Recent research foci have included criticality in design , feminist utopianism and care ethics for design , and culture and creative industries in Asia . These emphases on criticality , democratic participation in IT futures , and non - Western design practices all contribute to Bardzell ' s approach to social justice in HCI . Jill Dimond is a scholar , technologist , and activist . She holds a PhD from Georgia Tech and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Michigan . Dimond has long grappled with the tensions of research , technology , and social justice . In her graduate work , she conducted emancipatory action research alongside feminist social movements . She founded a worker - owned tech consultancy Sassafras Tech Collective , where she has helped build an example of an anti - oppressive tech workplace from the ground up . Most recently , she cofounded HeartMob , a platform built to crowd source support for those experiencing online harassment . Tad Hirsch is Associate Professor of Interaction Design at the University of Washington , and Director of the Public Practice Studio , a multidisciplinary , public - interest design group . For nearly two decades , Hirsch has collaborated with social justice movements and organizations to design and deploy new products and services . Drawing on this experience , he will explore the ways that social justice work differs from familiar forms of design practice , and how it challenges Panel CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 119 assumptions that designers often bring to their projects . Lilly Irani is an Assistant Professor of Communication , Science Studies , and Critical Gender Studies at University of California , San Diego . Her work examines and intervenes in the cultural politics of high tech work . She is part of the teams that designed , developed , and maintain Turkopticon and Dynamo – two systems for Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to work towards more just relations with employers . CSCW systems have become mainstream features of public life , from platform economy systems to digital microwork systems like Amazon Mechanical Turk . Irani will explore the ramifications of shifting CSCW towards analytics of “labor” for projects of CSCW and social justice . Panel structure The goal of our panel is to provide both an overview of current critical reflections on social justice oriented research and to open up space for debate . The panel is structured to provide time for panelists to discuss the ways they approach social justice through their work , while also allowing the audience to engage in extended conversation through questions in person and through social media . Introduction ( 5 minutes ) The moderator will begin by briefly introducing each panelist and offering a short statement on the history and current state of social justice oriented research within and beyond CSCW . Short presentation ( 60 minutes ) The panelists will each spend five minutes describing their research on social justice and collaborative systems . Each of the four panelists will then present a provocation for the CSCW community drawn from their research ( 5 minutes each ) . Following each provocation , the other panelists will be given the opportunity to offer a response and the audience will be invited to participate in the debate for up to 5 minutes before moving to the next provocation . Discussion ( 15 minutes ) The presentations and debates will take up to 65 minutes , leaving 15 minutes for an open - ended Q & A session with the audience . At this point , the audience will be invited to pose questions to the panelists or the group at large . If there are no questions from the audience , the panelists will be invited to ask each other questions regarding their presentations and / or respond to one of the general discussion questions listed above . After the panel We will distribute collective notes from the audience through our personal social media accounts and through relevant email listservs . Logistics The structure of the panel is intended to be informative to those unfamiliar with social justice or participatory forms of research while also be appealing to those with a strong background in the area . The standard projection equipment typically available for talks will be sufficient . Panel CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 120 References 1 .
