The objective of this study was to examine eating and drinking behaviours during transport journeys in a sample of young adults using wearable cameras that take continuous images every 30 s . Methods Seventy - eight 18 – 30 year olds wore an Autographer wearable camera for three consecutive days . Image coding schedules were designed to assess physical activity ( included transportation ) and diet . For the general description of data , frequency analysis was calculated as image number ( percentage ) and mean ( ± SD ) or median ( IQR ) when appropriate . Results A total of 281 , 041 images were coded and 32 , 529 ( 14 % ) of images involved transport . The median ( IQR ) camera wear time was 8 h per day ( 7 – 9 h ) . The camera images identified 52 participants ( 67 % ) either eating or drinking during transport ( excluding water ) . A total of 143 eating and drinking occasions were identified , averaging 3 occasions per person over the three study days . Fifty five ( 38 % ) eating episodes were identified by the camera images of which 27 ( 49 % ) were discretionary and 88 ( 62 % ) drinking episodes were identified of which ( 45 % ) were discretionary . Conclusion This study confirms that transport is a potential setting for intervention . Young adults are consuming discretion - ary food and beverages during transport which may contribute to energy - dense diets and compromise diet quality . Substi - tuting unhealthy with healthy food advertising and potentially prohibiting eating and drinking whilst on public transport is suggested . Keywords Transportation · Dietary behaviours · Physical activity · Wearable cameras · Young adults Introduction Young adults are vulnerable to weight gain and unhealthy dietary behaviours are known contributors [ 1 ] . Young adults are frequent consumers of foods prepared away from home ( FAH ) , ( i . e . fast food , independent restaurants and other takeaway options ) [ 2 ] which is associated with higher energy intakes [ 3 ] . Data from the 2005 – 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that the propor - tion of dietary energy from FAH is the largest among the younger cohort ( born 1981 to 1990 ) , totalling 40 % in the 2013 – 2014 survey [ 4 ] . Findings from the 2014 Canadian Community Healthy Survey showed that males aged 19 to 30 years consumed 49 % of their total energy intake from FAH , with females consuming slightly less 45 % [ 5 ] . Recent data is limited for Australian young adults , however , earlier studies have shown that they are also frequent consumers of * Alyse Davies alyse . davies @ sydney . edu . au 1 Nutrition and Dietetics Group , Charles Perkins Centre , School of Life and Environmental Sciences , The University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW 2006 , Australia 2 Prevention Research Centre , School of Public Health , The University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW 2006 , Australia 3 Department of Public Health , Health Promotion & Policy Research Unit , University of Otago , Wellington South , PO Box 7343 , Wellington 6242 , New Zealand 4 Charles Perkins Centre , School of Life and Environmental Sciences , The University of Sydney , Sydney , NSW 2006 , Australia 1876 European Journal of Nutrition ( 2021 ) 60 : 1875 – 1885 1 3 FAH with 55 % of 18 – 24 year - olds and 51 % of 25 – 29 year - olds are consuming FAH several times per week [ 6 ] . Over - consumption of less healthy foods ( i . e . discretion - ary ) and under - consumption of healthier foods ( i . e . five food groups ) are common dietary features for many young adults [ 7 ] . They are low consumers of fruit and vegetables [ 8 ] , high consumers of sugar - sweetened beverages ( SSB ) [ 1 ] and dis - cretionary foods [ 9 ] . Discretionary foods are energy dense and contain high amounts of nutrients that are of public health concern including saturated fat , added sugar and salt [ 10 ] . A serve of a discretionary food is defined by the Aus - tralian Guide to Healthy Eating ( AGHE ) as an amount that provides approximately 600 kilojoules ( kJ ) [ 11 ] . Data col - lected from the 2011 – 2012 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey ( NNPAS ) , showed that 52 % of males and 37 % of females aged 19 – 30 years consumed over five discre - tionary food serves per day [ 9 ] while the recommended is no more than three for men and two and a half for women . The eating occasions that contributed the most to total energy intake from discretionary foods and beverages in the NNPAS were dinner ( 27 % ) , lunch ( 18 % ) , snacks ( 17 % ) and bever - ages ( 13 % ) [ 9 ] . There has been considerable research exam - ining the association of the consumption of discretionary foods during sedentary behaviours such as television view - ing [ 12 ] . This study aims to examine an unstudied context for the consumption of discretionary foods – transport . This includes both sedentary driving , travelling on public trans - port and active transport . As young adults transition from the family home to a more independent lifestyle , diet quality often declines [ 13 ] . A perceived barrier to healthy eating is the lack of time to prepare healthy meals and juggling work or study and cer - tain leisure commitments [ 14 ] . These time constraints can lead to behaviours such as “eating on the run” , meaning buying and consuming FAH while engaged in other activi - ties , including transport - related journeys [ 15 , 16 ] . “Eating on the run” has been shown to predict 21 % of fast food and takeaway consumption [ 6 ] . Although foods and beverages consumed during transport may make a small contribution to overall energy intake , it might be a potential setting more easily amenable to intervention to reduce consumption of discretionary foods . Research suggests that public transport and walking modes have increased among young adults , particularly in metropolitan areas [ 17 , 18 ] . Although active travel such as walking to train stations or from personal residence to work has many known health benefits including reducing obesity [ 19 ] , the surrounding food environment likely to be encoun - tered on the journey promotes unhealthy dietary choices . Discretionary snack foods and SSB are commonly avail - able for purchase on railway station platforms [ 20 ] and the majority of advertising on the Sydney metropolitan train networks are unhealthy food and beverages [ 21 ] . Eating and drinking non - alcoholic beverages are permitted on public trains , ferries and light rail but not on buses in New South Wales ( NSW ) , Australia [ 22 ] . As eating and drinking on buses is not strongly enforced , it is mostly ignored whereas , in other places such as Singapore [ 23 ] eating and drinking is banned on trains and station platforms and fines apply . Eating and drinking on public transport have been debated worldwide with recent arguments opposing consumption for either travel etiquette reasons or to help tackle the obesity epidemic by medical experts [ 24 ] and by the public [ 25 ] . Prohibiting eating and drinking on urban public transport ( except fresh water , breastfeeding and for medical condi - tions ) is one recommendation for action in a recent report by the Department of Health and Social Care in the UK to help solve childhood obesity [ 24 ] . Digital technology such as wearable cameras provides continuous real - time image data which can capture dietary intake behaviours during all transport modes . The device is positioned around the neck of the individual and passively collects data from the wearer’s perspective [ 26 ] . Wear - able cameras have been previously used in travel research [ 27 – 29 ] , sun - safety [ 30 ] , diet [ 31 ] , food marketing [ 32 ] , physical activity [ 33 ] and sedentary behaviour [ 34 ] . The objective of this study was to examine eating and drinking behaviours during transport journeys in a sample of young adults by the use of wearable cameras . In particular , we aimed to examine the frequency and the types of foods and beverages consumed . Such contextual information might be used when designing intervention programs to inform new policy to improve young adults’ diet . Methods A sub - sample of young adults , aged between 18 and 30 years , from the larger Measuring Young adults Meals Study ( MYMeals ) , wore an Autographer camera for three consecutive days to examine dietary behaviours [ 35 ] . Recruitment methods included paid social media advertis - ing ( Facebook & Instagram ) , posters around the university campus , Cancer Council NSW fundraiser events ( Relay for Life ) and letters of invitation using names provided by the Australian Electoral Commission . Participants were com - pensated with a $ 110 AUD voucher . Ethics approval was obtained by the Human Research Ethics Committee ( project 2016 / 546 ) . Data were collected over a 10 month period from March 2018 to December 2018 . Participants expressed interest for the camera sub - study in the online initial screening and basic demographic questionnaire for the main study . Demographic questions included sex ( male , female , prefer not to say ) ; age ( 18 – 24 or 25 – 30 years ) ; education status ( primary school or less , secondary school , trade qualification / apprenticeship / 1877 European Journal of Nutrition ( 2021 ) 60 : 1875 – 1885 1 3 diploma or university degree ) ; residential postcode to cal - culate relative socio - economic advantage and disadvantage ranking within Australia ( high or low ) [ 36 ] ; geographic area ( metropolitan or non - metropolitan ) [ 37 ] ; and place of birth ( Australia , other or prefer not to say ) . Participants gave con - sent for the main study and those that expressed interest for the camera sub - study were contacted and briefed about the study requirements . All study materials including the Autographer camera , portable charger , connecting cables , information card , instruction manual and postage paid reply bag were mailed to the participants . The participants were asked to wear the camera on a lanyard around their neck with the camera positioned on their sternum for all waking hours over three consecutive days and to charge the camera overnight ( Fig . 1 ) . Study days were distributed across week - days and weekends among the sample . The camera passively captures images at 30 s intervals ( i . e . two images per minute on the medium capture rate ) , but occasionally more as the camera senses change in movement , light or temperature . Participants were advised to remove the camera or close the lens cover when privacy is expected ( e . g . bathroom ) , on Government premises , or if individuals felt uncomfort - able having their image captured . At the end of the study , participants could view and delete any images at their dis - cretion if privacy had not been observed . Anthropometric data were collected by a questionnaire at study completion and included self - reported weight ( kg ) and height ( cm ) to calculate Body Mass Index ( BMI = weight kg / height cm 2 ) which has been validated in a previous study [ 38 ] . Participants were anonymised using participant IDs . Images were stored on the university’s research data store which provides high - level security data storage , back - up and recovery and could only be accessed by the research team . Demographic and anthropometric information was hosted and stored on REDCap data management system [ 39 ] . Image coding For this study , image coding was performed using a coding protocol to guide content analysis by two researchers ( AD and VC ) . Coding begun in June 2018 and concluded March 2020 . Given the average dataset per participant was between 3000 – 4000 images which can take in excess of 15 h to code , a decision was made to select 78 participants for coding . The participant IDs were randomised using the “randomise a list” function in excel which assigns a random number to the participant ID which were set by sample characteristics ( sex and age ) . The reliability between coders was assessed using a test dataset of 3557 images and included the fol - lowing dimensions ; posture ( 92 % ) , eating episodes ( 100 % ) , food types ( 100 % ) , beverage types ( 92 % ) and product source ( 92 % ) . The identification of eating or drinking on transport by transport type ( private transport , public transport , walk - ing , cycling , combination of modes or undetermined ) was tested for inter - rater reliability using the 78 participants selected above that included 2140 images finding a 96 % agreement . One researcher ( AD ) coded for physical activ - ity in detail ( see below ) and the second researcher ( VC ) coded the dietary component in detail ( see below ) . An out - line of the coding framework for this study is displayed in Fig . 2 . Coding manuals are available from the first author on request . Physical activity coding Physical activity was annotated in four dimensions using a custom - designed application . The first two dimensions included the physical activity domain ( domestic , occupa - tional , transport and leisure ) and posture ( standing , sitting / reclining , changing position and other ) . The final two dimen - sions were the activity categories and activity sub - categories from the 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities [ 40 ] . The activity category transportation had activity sub - categories that included private transport ( i . e . riding or driving a car ) , public transport ( i . e . riding in a bus or train ) and walking for transportation . An additional category , waiting for public Fig . 1 Autographer camera used in this study , as worn on the sternum 1878 European Journal of Nutrition ( 2021 ) 60 : 1875 – 1885 1 3 transport was created for when participants were waiting at a transport facility . Cycling for transportation was identi - fied under the activity category bicycling . If the image was blocked , unclear , blurry , dark , or the camera was switched on but not worn by the participant , the images were deemed uncodable and no codes were applied . Dietary coding The dietary data were coded using a pre - determined coding schedule and recorded in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets . The dietary annotation protocol was categorised into five dimen - sions . The first dimension included posture ( codes were as per physical activity coding ) . The second dimension included the eating episode categorised into ; breakfast ( i . e . first meal of the day , usually between the time of waking and 11am ; lunch ( typically consumed between 12 and 3 pm ) ; dinner ( evening meal , usually consumed between 6 and 9 pm ) and snacks ( any individual food item / s or relatively smaller meal ) consumed in between the three main meals ; or undetermined if the coder was unable to ascertain the eating episode confidently . The third and fourth dimensions included food and beverage type and the AGHE was used to classify foods and beverages as either from the five food groups ; ( 1 ) grain ( cereal ) foods ; ( 2 ) fruit ; ( 3 ) vegetables and legumes / beans ; ( 4 ) milk , yoghurt , cheese and / or their alternatives ; and ( 5 ) meat , poultry , fish , eggs , tofu , nuts and seeds , or discretionary ( i . e . cake , choco - late , confectionary , potato chips , pastries , SSB , energy drinks ) [ 10 ] . An additional category ( tea and coffee ) was created for beverage type as these were items commonly consumed dur - ing transportation . The product source was the fifth dimension and included home , supermarket , convenience store , dessert outlet , beverage outlet , fast food chains , independent fast food outlets , café / bakery , other or undetermined . Prepared inside the home was defined as any food or beverage found within the home pantry or meals / snacks prepared within the home and consumed either within the home or outside the home . Prepared outside the home was defined as any food or beverage that was not prepared inside the home . This includes meals , snacks and drinks purchased from outlets as described above . Statistics Daily camera wear was calculated as a total number of images captured per person divided by 120 ( which was the approximate number of images captured per hour as two images were taken per minute ) and divided by three ( as three study days ) . For the rare occasion more than two images were captured within 60 s , the first two images only were used in the analysis for consistency . Median ( IQR ) was used to report camera wear time . Descriptive statistics ( frequencies and percentage distributions ) depicted eating and drinking during transportation . Water was excluded from the analysis . Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software , version 24 for windows ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Significance level was set at 0 . 05 . Fig . 2 Flowchart of study procedures and the summary of the coding framework . 1 Private transport includes a car . 2 Public transport includes trains , buses , light rail or when participants were waiting at a public transport facility 1879 European Journal of Nutrition ( 2021 ) 60 : 1875 – 1885 1 3 Results All participants ( n = 78 ) were included in the final analysis of 234 data days . The median ( IQR ) camera wear time was 8 h per day ( 7 – 9 h ) . The camera images identified 52 par - ticipants ( 67 % ) either eating or drinking during transport ( excluding water ) with a total of 143 eating and drinking occasions identified . Of these , 64 ( 45 % ) occurred while walking , 47 ( 33 % ) were private transport , 19 ( 13 % ) were a combination of any transport modes and 13 ( 9 % ) were public transport . Of all eating and drinking occasions that occurred on public transport ( including combination of modes ) , 13 were on trains / light rail and 10 on buses . Examples of eat - ing occasions are shown in Fig . 3 and drinking occasions in Fig . 4 . The sample characteristics included ; sex 51 % male , and 49 % female ; age 51 % 18 – 24 years , and 49 % 25 – 30 years ; socio - economic status , 64 % high and 36 % low ; geographic location 71 % metropolitan , 29 % non - metropolitan ; place of birth 68 % Australia , 32 % other / preferred not to say . The education status was as follows : university degree 53 % , sec - ondary school or less 31 % or trade qualification , appren - ticeship certificate or diploma ( TAFE or business college ) 17 % . Of participants , 56 % were acceptable or underweight ( BMI ≤ 24 . 99 kg / m 2 ) and 44 % were affected by overweight or obesity ( BMI ≥ 25 kg / m 2 ) . One participant had miss - ing weight measurements and was not included in BMI calculations . A total of 281 , 041 images were coded and 230 , 166 were included in the final analysis . The excluded images were either uncodable 9474 ( 4 % ) or were images exceeding the first two images of each minute 41 , 401 ( 18 % ) . Among the included images , 32 , 529 ( 14 % ) images involved transport . The most common mode of transport was private transport 14 , 359 ( 44 % ) followed by walking 9728 ( 30 % ) , public trans - port ( including waiting for public transport ) 8176 ( 25 % ) and cycling 266 ( 1 % ) . Passive transport ( i . e . sitting ) occurred more frequently 20 , 706 ( 64 % ) compared to non - passive transport 11 , 823 ( 36 % ) ( i . e . standing , walking or cycling ) . During transport , there was an average ( SD ) of 3 ( 1 . 5 ) eating or drinking occasions per person over the three days Fig . 3 Sample images for eating during transport journeys .

Eighty - eight were drinking occasions and 55 were food consumption with 30 ( 55 % ) coded as snacks , 15 ( 27 % ) as lunch and 10 ( 18 % ) as breakfast . Two in three occasions were food or beverages purchased away from home , with café / bakeries ( 27 % ) , fast food chains ( 18 % ) and convenience stores ( 16 % ) being the most common place of purchase . A total of 27 food intake episodes ( 49 % ) and 40 drinking episodes ( 45 % ) were categorised as discretionary , with only nine items in total ( 6 % ) that could not be cat - egorised and deemed undetermined . Discretionary food and beverages consumed during transport are shown in Fig . 5 . Discussion To the best of our knowledge , this is the first paper to objectively examine eating and drinking behaviours across multiple settings of transportation . The use of automated wearable cameras allowed researchers to identify eating and drinking behaviours as they occurred under free - living conditions . The results from this study revealed that two in three young adults in this sample were eating or drinking during all modes of transportation including public transport ( i . e . bus , train or light rail ) , private transport ( i . e . car ) and walking to and from places . Sixty - five percent of the eating or drinking occasions identified by the images were FAH with café / bakeries , fast food chains and convenience stores being the most common place for purchase . About half of the food and beverages consumed during transport were dis - cretionary items . While we have not documented the dietary contribution transport makes to total daily intake this does show transportation is a context for both unhealthy food and healthy consumption equally while public health nutrition recommendations indicate discretionary foods should com - prise no more than 20 % of intake ( 1800 kJ ) [ 41 ] . Young adults are the most at - risk group of adults for unhealthy weight gain and should be targeted for future obesity prevention efforts . Current trends from the Fig . 4 Sample images for drinking during transport journeys . Images ( a ) were coded as beverages from the five food groups ( b ) tea / coffee and ( c , d ) as discretionary drinks . The transport mode for images ( a ) private transport ; car , ( b ) public transport ; bus ( c ) walking and ( d ) public transport ; train 1881 European Journal of Nutrition ( 2021 ) 60 : 1875 – 1885 1 3 Australian National Health Survey ( NHS ) show that the prevalence of young adults affected by overweight and obesity is rising and has increased from 39 % in 2014 – 2015 to 46 % in 2017 – 2018 [ 42 ] . Furthermore , 35 % of their daily energy intake comes from discretionary food and beverages [ 43 ] . Action is required across the industry and the public sector to improve their diets and help reverse the trend and the future increase expected . A focus on different settings may be beneficial as it can provide an opportunity for intervention . Food provision polices have been implemented in schools to encourage healthy food choices [ 44 ] and given train stations are controlled by State Government , a number of regulatory approaches could be implemented to help tackle the obesity epidemic and improve the diets of young adults , children and travel - ling public - at - large . The transport domain provides one setting for inter - ventions that aim to reduce consumption of discretionary foods . This study showed that about half of the food and beverages consumed during transport were discretionary products . A previous study [ 9 ] reported that from all eating occasions , snacks and beverages were occasions that made a large contribution to discretionary food energy . Results from this study revealed that during transport , two in three occasions were beverages and more than fifty percent of the eating occasions were snacks . Furthermore , the food environment surrounding many transport hubs promotes unhealthy choices . The images captured by the wearable cameras identified participants purchasing discretionary foods and beverages from these hubs and consuming them while commuting . Sugar - sweetened beverages were one of the most consumed items during transport and model - ling has suggested that a reduction of one 375 mL serving each week may decrease weight by 0 . 31 kg in those aged 19 – 24 years [ 45 ] . A previous study conducted an audit of vending machines at train stations across NSW and showed that a large proportion of items for sale were high energy foods and beverages including chips , SSB , choco - late and confectionary items [ 20 ] . Limiting the availability of discretionary foods in vending machines and increasing access to healthy food in surrounding food outlets may positively influence eating behaviours and help reduce excess energy from discretionary food . Unhealthy food and beverage marketing are targeted towards young adults but little efforts have been made to protect this age group as advocacy , policy and research efforts have primarily focused on children [ 46 ] . A systematic review reported that children exposed to food advertising on TV consumed an average of 251 kJ more than children not exposed and those affected by overweight or obesity consumed on average 191 kJ more than those of a healthy weight [ 47 ] . A study in New Zealand using wearables cam - eras showed that children are frequently exposed to mar - keting of energy - dense nutrient - poor foods including SSB , fast food and confectionary across all settings [ 32 ] . It has been documented that young adults are frequently exposed to unhealthy food and beverage advertising on metropolitan train networks ( in this study it was Sydney ) and many may be unaware that this may be influencing their choices [ 21 ] . Exposure of outdoor advertising ( e . g . digital screens , signs , buses , and shop fronts ) in addition to social media should be targeted to help reduce consumption of unhealthy products . Furthermore , not only are unhealthy food and beverages advertised on these marketing mediums , food delivery apps ( i . e . Ubereats , Deliveroo and Menulog ) are also promoted and two in three users of these digital ordering apps are young adults [ 48 ] . Fig . 5 Percentage of discretionary food and beverages consumed during transport , ( a ) shows discretionary food ( n = 27 ) and ( b ) discretionary beverages ( n = 40 ) 1882 European Journal of Nutrition ( 2021 ) 60 : 1875 – 1885 1 3 Important social determinants for the development of obesity include social norms around eating [ 24 ] . Young adults are influenced by social norms [ 49 ] therefore , chang - ing social norms around eating and drinking during all modes of transportation may play a role in obesity genesis and prevention . Walking was the major form of transpor - tation during which food or drinks was consumed in this study . While this behaviour was frowned upon decades ago in Australia , current social norms are more accepting . Private transport ( i . e . car ) was the most common transport mode and second highest occasions of eating and drinking . Not only does eating while driving negatively impact driv - ing performance [ 50 ] , the camera images confirmed that while driving , unhealthy snacks and beverages , in addition to meals purchased from fast food drive thrus were con - sumed . Furthermore , combining sedentary behaviours with unhealthy dietary behaviours may have additional implica - tions for future chronic disease risk [ 51 ] . Many young adults use public transport as their main method of travel for work and study [ 17 ] . A quarter of images in this study were coded as public transport and although only a small number of eat - ing and drinking occasions were identified , this behaviour was observed on both trains and light rail ( permitted ) and buses ( not permitted ) . With population growth and improve - ments to transport infrastructure , public transport use will increase over time , therefore , it is proposed that the State Government and Transport NSW consider two recommenda - tions to help improve diets for the prevention of overweight and obesity . These recommendations were addressed in an independent report by the UK chief medical officer in 2019 and include ; ( 1 ) prohibiting eating and drinking on urban transport ( except fresh water , breastfeeding and for certain medical conditions and ; ( 2 ) introducing a free “water refill” scheme to be available in all food and drink retail sites , hotels and public - sector buildings , including public trans - port stations and sports facilities [ 24 ] . To reverse the expected rise in obesity , it is important that we consider multiple settings for intervention . While this study confirms that discretionary foods are being consumed during transport , it will be useful to understand the propor - tion of energy from discretionary foods consumed during transport to the total daily energy intake from discretionary foods . Modelling has suggested that as little as an additional 100 kJ each day ( equivalent to one - sixth of a serve of discre - tionary food ) results in an average gain of 1 kg annually [ 52 ] . This would inform the strength of the argument to guide new policy around this understudied setting . The methodology used in the present study has several advantages . Wearable cameras provide detailed contextual information in free - living settings . The transport mode and behaviours could be assessed objectively through continuous digital photography . A high agreement between coders was reported , similar to a previous study using wearable cameras [ 30 ] . Our analysis of the data was limited by having 78 par - ticipants and 234 study days therefore , the results may not be generalised to the young adult population . Furthermore , as a large proportion of individuals in this sample were from high socio - economic , metropolitan areas of NSW and were highly educated ( 53 % with a university degree ) , findings may underestimate this behaviour in the general population . Data may have been missed if participants removed or turned off the camera during transport journeys and it is unknown if individuals were more likely to turn off the camera during public transport compared with private transport . The 30 s intervals between image capture may have missed possible eating or drinking occasions , particularly quick snacking . Data processing and coding time is a limiting factor for the device and may be unsuitable for use in large - scale studies unless a system is developed to automatically recognise and classify transport modes and food and beverage items . Conclusion This is the first study objectively assessing eating and drink - ing behaviours during transportation . Although not all con - sumption on transport has been captured , the results of this study highlight that young adults are consuming unhealthy foods and beverages during all transport modes which may contribute to unwanted weight gain . The transport domain provides an opportunity for intervention by changing social norms around eating or drinking while travelling to and from places . Further research into the impact of regulating advertising for unhealthy products around transport hubs and potentially prohibiting food and beverages ( except water ) on urban transport may provide an opportunity to reduce discretionary consumption and assist in obesity prevention in young adults .
