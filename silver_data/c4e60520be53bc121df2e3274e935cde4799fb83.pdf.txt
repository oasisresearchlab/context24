The current upsurge in telehealth use in palliative and hospice care warrants consideration of patient , family caregiver , and interdisciplinary palliative perspectives on telehealth modality and communication experiences . Currently , telehealth experiences and encounters are being described but not yet extensively evaluated by palliative care teams . Objectives . To locate survey instruments available to assess telehealth interactions , to determine the content and constructs covered by the available instruments , and to describe the patient populations previously surveyed by the existing instruments . Methods . This study and its reporting followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines with the protocol registered in The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews . Three databases were searched with over 3100 articles analyzed for use of a telehealth survey instrument . Results . Twelve telehealth communication assessment instruments were identiﬁed with a mean length of 20 questions , primarily Likert - scale responses with one inclusive of free text and one qualitative inquiry survey . Three inquired only into modality , four queried communication , and ﬁve studied both modality and communication experience . Existing telehealth survey instruments are unidirectional in exploring patient or family experience , with two inclusive of provider perspectives . Participant demographics are notably underreported in telehealth experience studies with a frank lack of diversity in ethnic / racial , geographic , age , educational , and income representativeness in current telehealth survey instrument respondents . Conclusion . Palliative care teams may consider familiarity with telehealth survey instrument as an essential component to progress from description of telehealth use to evaluation of telehealth encounters . Current survey instrument outcome reports do not represent inclusivity or diversity , although telehealth is now being clinically applied across settings . J Pain Symptom Manage 2020 ; - : - e - .

After the pandemic , both care providers and pa - tients may remain drawn to potentially attractive fea - tures of telehealth such as the ability to be seen at home , the ability to include family from other regions of the country in visits , and reductions in the need for physical ofﬁce space . Patient and family caregivers deserve opportunities to provide feedback on whether telehealth encounters still maintain a sense of human connectedness and connectivity essential to the ﬁelds of palliative care and hospice care . An essential consid - eration in the goal of telehealth to extend care and communication reach with equity is to explore whether there has been inclusion of diverse popula - tions for perspectives on telehealth experiences . 11 If telehealth is to serve as a partnership tool , access and assessments of telehealth necessarily should reﬂect community input . 12 e 14 Under the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services speciﬁed that hospice providers may provide routine home care as well as face - to - face encounters for recertiﬁcation via tele - health . 15 The Health and Human Services Ofﬁce for Civil Rights ‘‘will exercise enforcement discretion and waive penalties for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act violations , ’’ allowing care pro - viders to communicate with patients and families via commonly used communication tools such as Skype and FaceTime . 16 The Children’s Health Insurance Program , private insurers covering pediatric cohorts , and Medicaid reduced barriers to telehealth use for child and family caregiver behavioral health assess - ment and management , symptom - based care , and concurrent wellness care for children . 17 Palliative care teams are navigating rapid telehealth uptake while also attending to the patient , family caregiver , and interdisciplinary team communication experiences during an exponential increase in tele - health use in clinical practice . A prior systematic review , aptly titled ‘‘telehealth in palliative care is being described but not evaluated , ’’ recognized the lack of available evidence document - ing perceptions about telehealth encounters for pa - tients and family caregivers . 18 To move toward a robust understanding of telehealth communication experiences , palliative care teams beneﬁt from aware - ness of the survey instruments currently available to assess patient care experience using telehealth modal - ities . The objective of this review was to locate survey instruments used to assess telehealth interactions , to determine the content and constructs covered by the available instruments , and to describe the patient pop - ulations previously surveyed by the existing instruments . Methods Search Strategy This review and its reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines , with the protocol regis - tered in The International Prospective Register of Sys - tematic Reviews as CRD42020200468 . 19 With the guidance of a medical research librarian , a search strategy was formulated using keywords and related subjects inclusive of ( ‘‘telehealth , ’’ OR ‘‘telemedi - cine’’ ) AND ( ‘‘survey ( s ) ’’ OR ‘‘questionnaire’’ ) AND ( ‘‘experience’’ AND ‘‘communication’’ ) AND ( ‘‘valid - ity’’ OR ‘‘reliability’’ ) . Three databases were searched ( PubMed , Embase , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [ CINAHL ] ) for articles matching the inclusion criteria ( Appendix I ) . Study Selection Inclusion criteria included any article that was pub - lished in English between 2005 and 2020 which con - tained the development or analysis of a telehealth survey . The year 2005 marked a transition time be - tween telephonic - based and video - based telehealth . 20 Case report ( s ) , editorial ( s ) , letter ( s ) , commentaries , and opinion documents were excluded . Manuscripts were uploaded into EndNote for review of the potential inclusionary articles . The initial search generated 4887 citations with 7 citations hand - selected from prior study team familiarity with the literature . 21 Duplicate studies were removed , and the remaining 3154 articles were screened in accordance to the estab - lished inclusionary criteria . Three authors assessed each manuscript for potential inclusion initially at the title / abstract level ( J . L . , B . W . , M . S . W . ) and 2 Vol . - No . - - 2020 Weaver et al . then at the full - text level so that each article was inde - pendently assessed by a minimum of two of the three participating reviewers ( J . L . , B . W . , M . W . ) . Interrater reliability was notably > 85 % across the reviewers at each stage of manuscript review ( Figure 1 ) . Data Extraction All authors abstracted data to a shared virtual spread - sheet ﬁtted with the articles and outcomes , with a pri - mary data extractor and a blinded data check partner assigned per survey . The data - extraction sheet was pi - loted on ﬁve surveys and revised based on study group discussion . Fields of data extraction interest included survey item numbers , question types , target population ( health provider , patient , or both ) ; languages ; con - structs ; communication experience ( perception regarding the human interaction ) or communication modality ( perception regarding the technology inter - face ) question measures ; theoretical frameworks used in survey development ; and prior hospice or palliative care survey use . Validity and reliability were each re - ported as a binary variable ( yes / no ) within the data - extraction form with additional free text for description of how psychometric properties were reported . Diversity Snapshot To explore the populations previously included in telehealth survey research , PubMed was searched as a sole ‘‘snapshot’’ database using each survey name and acronym . Two study team members engaged in data extraction using a shared document designed and piloted by the study team ( M . L . N . , M . S . W . ) . The following items were obtained for each manu - script using the telehealth survey : patient or family caregiver or other respondent ; pediatric or adolescent ( deﬁned as age < 19 years ) , adult , or geriatric ( deﬁned as age > 65 years ) participants ; geographic location ; description of diagnoses ; gender diversity ; survey lan - guage ; rural or urban setting ; socioeconomic sum - maries ; and ethnic / racial representation . Results Twelve telehealth communication assessment in - struments were identiﬁed and agreed upon by the study team members . The constructs measured by the survey instruments and exemplary survey ques - tions depicting the communication modality or hu - man interaction themes are provided in Table 1 . Mean survey length was 20 questions ( median 18 , range 5 - 60 questions ) . Surveys consisted of Likert scale responses ranging from 3 - to 11 - point responses with a mean 5 - point scale . One survey was inclusive of space for free - text responses complimenting the quantitative responses ( Computer System Usability Questionnaire [ CSUQ ] ) , and one survey was qualitative ( Telenursing Interaction and Satisfaction Questionnaire [ TISQ ] ) . Three instruments ( 25 % ) inquired only into tech - nology modality in terms of usability , connectivity fac - tors , and the satisfaction with the video / audio interface ( Technology Acceptance Model [ TAM ] , Sys - tem Usability Scale [ SUS ] , CSUQ ) . Four instruments ( 33 % ) solely explored the experience of human inter - action in terms of the perceived quality of communica - tion , visit content , therapeutic relationship , or care experience ( Patient Assessment of Communication During Telemedicine [ PACT ] , Perceived Efﬁcacy in Patient - Physician Interactions [ PEPPI - 5 ] , Patient Experience Questionnaire , TISQ ) . Five instruments ( 42 % ) explored both the communication modality and the human experience with communication ( Tel - ehealth Satisfaction Scale [ TeSS ] , Telemedicine Satis - faction and Usefulness Questionnaire [ TSUQ ] , Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire [ TMPQ ] , Tel - ehealth Usability Questionnaire [ TUQ ] , Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire [ TSQ ] ) .

Survey instruments were notably unidirectional with the intention to assess a patient or patient family mem - ber’s experience with telehealth rather than both pro - vider and patient dyadic experience . Telehealth instruments could be applied to patient experience in 10 ( 83 % ) scales ( TeSS , TSUQ , PACT , TMPQ , TUQ , TSQ , PEPPI - 5 , Patient Experience Questionnaire , CSUQ , TISQ ) . Only two ( 17 % ) scales were formatted for opportunity for both patient and provider compara - tiveassessmentsofthetelehealthencounter ( TAM , SUS ) . Theory was referenced in the development of three scales : Technology Acceptance Model ( TAM ) , 22 Tele - health Usability Questionnaire ( TUQ ) , 23 and the Tele - nursing Interaction and Satisfaction Questionnaire ( TISQ ) . 24 Survey adaptation included the development of the TUQ scale created as a combination of questions from the TSW , TSUQ , and TMPQ scales . The original TAM was adapted into three survey editions ( TAM3 ) rele - vant to telehealth . Psychometric properties of the scales are reported in Table 1 . Cronbach’s alpha is notably high for the available telehealth assessment instruments with recognition of generally high internal consistency re - ported for survey items . Validity reporting was notably diverse with many survey instruments describing valid - ity as ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘reasonable’’ or ‘‘high’’ but lacking quantiﬁed measures of validity ( Table 1 ) . Validity was not described for the two surveys developed from prior validated survey items ( PACT , TUQ ) . All survey instruments were validated in English with Chinese ( TAM , TSQ ) , Dutch ( TSQ , PEPPI - 5 ) , Spanish ( TSUQ ) , and Swedish ( TISQ ) as additional available languages . Manuscripts lacked mention of use of translators or interpreters during telehealth en - counters or telehealth assessments . Speciﬁc to the ﬁeld of palliative care or hospice care , telehealth survey instruments have been applied in assessing the transition of adult rural 25 and pediat - ric 26 patients to home hospice ( TAM ) and palliative and hospice care patient symptom reporting usage ( SUS ) . 27 These studies , notably with small sample sizes , depict telehealth as acceptable according to pe - diatric self - report , family caregiver insight , and adult cohorts based on the efﬁciency of the technology sys - tem and the effectiveness of the audio / video commu - nication modalities . 25 , 26 Technology - fostered interactions were deemed useable communication prototypes for facilitation of communication , shared decision - making , and self - management by 18 surveyed adult palliative care patients . 27 Telehealth as a care and communication modality was notably more acceptable to children receiving hospice and their family caregivers than to hospice nurses , 26 warranting additional consideration of interdisciplinary team per - spectives on telehealth . d o c t o r ’’ C o m p u t e r S y s t e m U s a b il i t y Q u e s t i o nn a i r e ( C S U Q ) S y s t e m u s a b ili t y a n d c a p a b ili t y ‘‘ T h e i n t e r f a c e o f t h i s s y s t e m i s p l e a s a n t ’’ ; ‘‘ T h i s s y s t e m h a s a ll t h e f u n c t i o n s a n d c a p a b ili t i e s I e x p e c t i t t o h a v e ’’ N A C r o n b a c h ’ s a l p h a 0 . 9 C o rr e l a t i o n v a li d i t y 0 . 4 ; r e a s o n a b l e c o n c u rr e n t v a li d i t y r e p o r t e d .

Vol . - No . - - 2020 5 Telehealth Survey Instruments Previous Populations Forty - ﬁve articles were assessed for populations included in prior telehealth research . Table 2 provides a summary of respondent demographics according to telehealth survey instrument use . Telehealth survey in - struments have primarily been used to assess patient experience ( n ¼ 41 , 91 % ) 23 , 24 , 28 e 64 with less frequent use to assess family caregiver ( n ¼ 7 , 16 % ) 28 , 34 , 37 , 40 , 65 , 66 or medical provider experience ( n ¼ 8 , 18 % ) . 23 , 35 , 40 , 67 e 71 Telehealth surveys have been underused to assess the experience of pediatric or adolescent cohorts with only two ( 4 % ) surveys used to assess the experi - ence of pediatric care experiences or pediatric family caregiver experiences : TeSS for use in pediatric sur - gery telehealth communication 72 and TAM for pediat - ric telehospice care . 26 Fifteen studies ( 33 % ) included geriatric participants . Demographic data for participants responding to the instruments are notably lacking in telehealth research articles with only 11 ( 24 % ) studies reporting on race or ethnicity , 18 ( 40 % ) reporting on some form of socioeconomic status , 18 ( 40 % ) reporting on geographic urban or rural representation , and 37 ( 82 % ) reporting on gender . For those articles report - ing demographic data , most telehealth survey instru - ments respondents across telehealth survey scale options are noted to be Caucasian , with a postsec - ondary education , and not of the low - income category ( Table 3 ) . Discussion Palliative care teams may consider use of survey in - struments to assess patient experiences with tele - health . Palliative care and hospice research has focused extensively on descriptive methodologies to assess telehealth experiences . 18 While telehealth has been deemed useable and acceptable in palliative care outreach , the methodology to determine such has primarily been qualitative inquiry and small - scale studies . 73 Familiarity with the constructs assessed by available telehealth survey instruments is paramount in differentiating whether the focus is on the technol - ogy interface or the human interaction or both . The boundaries of the constructs do blur in certain ques - tion formats , such as in asking whether the participant experienced the telehealth interaction as equal to an in - person encounter . Not only do palliative care pro - viders and researchers need to have familiarity with the constructs assessed but they also beneﬁt from un - derstanding the strengths and weaknesses of the different assessment tools , including whether these tools are reliable and valid .

Reasons for prior slow telehealth uptake in pallia - tive care and hospice include patient discomfort with accessing or using technology for medical care , family caregivers’ concerns about the usability of technology for adequate support , concerns about the difﬁculty of technology use or reliability , and fear about jeopardiz - ing the integrity of the provider - patient relationship with a screen barrier as compared to face - to - face care . 74 Lack of access to smartphone or computer ser - vices and the internet platforms required for tele - health use has been understudied , 75 raising concern about telehealth reach into underserved areas such as tribal homelands and rural regions . 76 , 77 In recognizing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic , there may be a norm - referenced shift in re - sponses as survey questions regarding the ‘‘conve - nience’’ of telehealth as a communication modality are now confounded by not just time and distance saved but also perceptions of preventative public health measures . Even survey questions regarding ‘‘acceptability’’ are inﬂuenced by the now - normative approach to virtual interactions in nonmedical set - tings ( schooling , extended family connectedness , community gatherings ) as a public health safety mea - sure . Palliative care researchers thus warrant caution in comparing responses to current telehealth surveys in relation to a preset , prepandemic standard . With respect to the inclusion of diverse populations inthevalidation andutilization ofthevarious telehealth assessment measures , our team discovered that what is not reported speaks just as loudly as what is . In fact , our review revealed a concerning lack of reporting on the demographic makeup of study participants in addi - tion to a lack of diversity . Children and adolescents as well as geriatric age cohorts are notably underrepre - sented , and family caregivers are only rarely included in telehealth survey instrument reporting . Further , nonwhite or low - income populations and those without a postsecondary education are notably underrepre - sented in studies using the existing telehealth instru - ments . Educational exposures to varying technology interfaces , generational interpretation , and comfort with technology , culture , geography , economic access to personally owned technology , and language are sure to impact perceptions of telehealth . Furthermore , particularly with renewed calls for inclusion and the importance of listening to diverse voices in all facets of the public sphere , attentiveness to diversity and inclu - sion in eliciting feedback on telehealth experiences is critical . Lack of diversity reduces the generalizability of the existing telehealth survey ﬁndings . Limitations of this study include the restriction to English - language manuscripts . The limited number of research - based telehealth manuscripts and the lower quality of the available studies further limit over - all application of ﬁndings .

Vol . - No . - - 2020 7 Telehealth Survey Instruments Conclusion Logical next steps in telehealth research in pallia - tive care include the development and then use of vali - dated telehealth experience survey instruments with paired consideration of not only technology interface but also measure of human interaction . The unique - ness of palliative care practice makes the existing in - struments helpful but likely insufﬁcient for direct application . Ideally future telehealth research would include triangulated patient , family caregiver , and pro - vider scale use for comparison in perspectives of the same virtual encounters . Future telehealth research for patients receiving palliative care may consider methods that concurrently and longitudinally assess symptom burden , quality of life , and cost analyses . Overall , this review revealed that instruments exist to measure patient and family caregiver perceptions of telehealth , but the instruments are currently under - used . Caution should be taken to ensure telehealth support meets the cultural and educational needs of the communities that have not yet provided perspec - tive on telehealth encounters . The lack of participant diversity in reporting on telehealth communication using telehealth survey instruments warrants attentive - ness to inclusion to better understand perspectives on telehealth encounters .
