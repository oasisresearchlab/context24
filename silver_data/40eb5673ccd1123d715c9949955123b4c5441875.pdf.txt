1 . Introduction Despite its prevalence in various fields as a tech - nique for measuring the local mechanical proper - ties of elastic materials , the accuracy of indentation testing utilizing the atomic force microscope ( AFM : see Figure 1 ) remains equivocal . Aside from artifacts arising from factors that can affect instrument performance ( e . g . , drift due to tempera - ture variations ) , the causes of the ambiguity can be methodological ( e . g . , uncertainties in determining cantilever bending stiffness and tip dimensions ) or analytical ( e . g . , uncertainties in robustness and accuracy of the data processing method ) in nature . With care and the employment of existing tech - nologies , environmental and methodological effects can be minimized . However , the latter cate - 576 * Corresponding authors , e - mail : lindavid @ mail . nih . gov , horkay @ helix . nih . gov © BME - PT and GTE Elasticity of rubber - like materials measured by AFM nanoindentation D .

We exploit the force spectroscopy capabilities of the atomic force microscope in characterizing the local elastic - ity of rubber - like materials . Extraction of elastic properties from force curves usually relies on the linear theory pioneered by Hertz . While the Hertzian force - indentation relationships have been shown to be accurate in modeling the contact mechanics at sufficiently shallow indentation depths , the linear deformation regime of the probed material is exceeded in many practical applications of nanoindentation . In this article , a simple , nonlinear force - indentation equation based on the Mooney - Rivlin model is derived and used to fit data from the indentation of lightly crosslinked poly ( vinyl alcohol ) gels in equilibrium with water . The extracted values of Young’s modulus show good agreement with those obtained by both macroscopic compression testing and by fitting truncated portions of the force curves with the Hertz equation .

Schematics of the atomic force microscope ( left ) and indentation of the sample by the tip ( right ) . Displacement control is achieved by moving the sample ( as shown ) or the cantilever base , usu - ally with piezo tube actuators . Force is inferred from laser - based measurements of cantilever deflection d . The indentation depth δ is depend - ent on both d and the vertical displacement of the scanner ( or the cantilever base ) z . gory of sources is not as easily addressed because data processing methods are model dependent and no clear performance benchmark exists . Further - more , indentation at all length scales can deviate significantly from ideal behavior due to tip - sample interactions ( e . g . , adhesion ) and material nonuni - formities . This is especially true of gels and other rubber - like materials . Recently , we developed and validated a robust and comprehensive scheme for extracting Young’s moduli from the indentation of soft materials based on linear elastic contact mechanics theory [ 1 , 2 ] . For a set of poly ( vinyl alcohol ) – henceforth abbre - viated to PVA – gels at different polymer concen - trations , Young’s moduli agreed well with macro - scopic compression tests when indentation strains did not exceed the linear elastic limit . These results are consistent with the generally accepted view that small - strain deformation of many rubber - like mate - rials is virtually a linear elastic process and can be modeled accordingly . Depending on the magnitude of tip - sample interactions , however , it is oftentimes difficult to control the indentation depth of each stroke of the AFM probe . Furthermore , tip - sample interactions often result in decreased signal - to - noise ratios . The effect is usually most pronounced in the vicinity of the tip - sample contact point ; under such circumstances , accuracy is adversely affected by limiting the analysis to data points that do not exceed a strain threshold . For materials that exhibit rubber elastic behavior , derivation of a sin - gle contact mechanics equation relating force and indentation depth is therefore necessary . Such a model would also be applicable in estimating the large - strain mechanical response of soft biological materials such as cells and tissues , where the use of linear elasticity theory generally leads to significant errors in Young’s modulus [ 3 ] . In this work , we propose an approximate relationship suitable for the indentation of Mooney - Rivlin materials with spherical probes and test it by fitting to data obtained from the AFM indentation of highly swollen PVA gels . Accuracy of this model is assessed by comparison with results from macro - scopic compression tests and from fitting initial , small - strain portions of each dataset with the classi - cal Hertz equation . 2 . Theory The indentation problem is based on the Hertz the - ory of contact between two elastic spheres in the absence of adhesion [ 4 ] . Johnson et al . [ 5 ] pio - neered the theory of adhesive contact , citing evi - dence of deviation from Hertzian behavior in numerous experiments as the motivation for devel - oping the now well - known Johnson - Kendall - Roberts ( JKR ) theory . Other contributors to the field include Derjaguin et al . [ 6 ] , Tabor [ 7 ] , and Maugis [ 8 ] . For the purposes of this work , only the Derjaguin - Muller - Toporov ( DMT ) theory is con - sidered . The JKR and DMT theories were found by Tabor to apply to opposite extremes of the relation - ship between surface force and sample compliance , with the DMT theory pertaining to relatively stiff samples and weak adhesive forces [ 7 ] . The Hertz and DMT equations ( ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) for the indentation of a linear elastic , infinite half - space with a rigid sphere are [ 4 , 6 ] : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) where F is the net indentation force , F n is the applied normal force , F ad is the tip - sample adhesive force ( = 0 in the Hertz theory ) , δ is the indentation depth , a is the contact radius , R is the radius of the sphere , and E and ν are Young’s modulus and Pois - son’s ratio of the indented sample , respectively . In the DMT theory , the constant adhesive force is related to the interfacial energy ( γ ) by Equation ( 3 ) : F ad = 2 πγ R ( 3 ) According to Yoffe [ 9 ] , Hertz stated explicitly that Equation ( 2 ) applies only to cases in which the con - tact radius is small relative to the radius of the indenter ( i . e . , a / R < 0 . 1 ) . In practice , however , contact radii frequently exceed the imposed limit . Experimental and analytical support for applying the equation at large relative contact radii can be found in tests performed by Kumar and Narasimhan [ 10 ] and the theoretical studies of Yoffe [ 9 ] . In the macroscopic indentation of poly - methyl methacrylate samples using stainless steel balls , Kumar and Narasimhan found excellent agreement between measured values of the contact radius and those predicted by Equation ( 2 ) for a / R 577 Lin et al . – eXPRESS Polymer Letters Vol . 1 , No . 9 ( 2007 ) 576 – 584 ) 1 ( 3 4 2 2 3 2 1 ν − δ = + = ER F F F ad n δ = R a approaching 0 . 14 . Yoffe developed a first - order correction to the Hertzian contact radius at large indentation depths and demonstrated that the devia - tion from the Hertz theory as the contact area widened was dependent on ν . As ν approached the incompressibility limit of 0 . 5 , it was found that Equation ( 2 ) began to over predict the magnitude of the contact radius . For example , when ν = 0 . 4 , the error in a predicted by Equation ( 2 ) increased from 1 % at a / R ~ 0 . 28 to 6 % at a / R ~ 0 . 53 . These errors can be considered acceptably small , even at the large strains that are frequently applied in the indentation of polymer gels . 3 . Materials and methods 3 . 1 . Sample preparation and testing PVA solutions were prepared by dissolving PVA ( molecular weight 70 000 – 100 000 ; Sigma ) in deionized water at 99°C to make a stock solution with a concentration of 14 % ( w / w ) . Gels were made by crosslinking the PVA solution with glu - taraldehyde at pH ~ 1 . 5 ( adjusted by addition of HCl ) . To prepare gel samples at two different levels of compliance , the PVA concentration was changed while maintaining a constant crosslink density ( one unit of GDA per 100 units of vinyl alcohol ) . The elastic moduli of these gels differed by roughly an order of magnitude corresponding to the typical range of biological soft tissues such as cartilage . Gel cylinders and thick layers ( 2 mm to > 1 cm ) with final PVA concentrations of 6 % and 12 % ( w / w ) were cast in molds ( 1 cm in diameter and 1 cm in height ) and 35 mm Petri dishes , respec - tively . All samples were stored in deionized water until testing . A bench top materials testing system ( Stable Micro Systems , UK ) was used to perform displacement - controlled compression of the gel cylinders at a ramp speed of 1 mm / s . The undeformed dimen - sions of each cylinder were measured prior to com - pression with a micrometer . The Young’s moduli of the PVA gels were calculated from the neo - Hookean equation ( 4 ) : σ = G ( λ – λ – 2 ) ( 4 ) where σ is the engineering stress , λ is the compres - sion ratio , and G is the shear modulus . In the exper - iment , λ was varied in the range 0 . 6 < λ < 1 . The absence of volume change and barreling during the compression measurements was checked [ 1 ] . Nanoindentation of gels was performed using a commercial AFM ( Bioscope I with a Nanoscope IIIA controller , Veeco Instruments , Santa Barbara , CA ) seated atop an inverted optical microscope . General - purpose silicon nitride tips were used ( model DNP , Veeco ) . The cantilevers were modi - fied by gluing either a 9 . 6 μ m diameter polystyrene bead or a 5 . 5 μ m diameter glass bead near the tip . The spring constant of each cantilever was deter - mined using the thermal tune method [ 11 ] . Multiple force curves for each PVA film were collected using the ‘force - volume’ mode of the AFM . In this automated raster scanning method , the user defines the size of the square region to be scanned , the res - olution , and the relative trigger threshold ( i . e . , the maximum cantilever deflection ) . Because the gels were assumed to be relatively homogeneous , the resolution was set to the lowest limit of 16 × 16 indentations covering a 20 μ m × 20 μ m region . Relative trigger thresholds were set to either 100 or 50 nm . 3 . 2 . Processing of AFM indentation data An algorithm that we developed previously [ 1 , 2 ] was used as the basis for automated processing of indentation data . Briefly , the contact point depend - ent method requires the identification of multiple reference points , shown in Figure 2 for both adhe - sive and non - adhesive analysis . These points are used to transform the typical raw values of can - tilever deflection ( d ) and base displacement ( z ) to applied force and indentation , respectively . The conversions are given by Equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) : F n = k c ( d – d 0 ) ; negligible adhesion ( 5 ) F n = k c ( d – d 1 ) ; significant adhesion ( 6 ) δ = ( z – z 0 ) – ( d – d 0 ) = ( z – d ) – ( z 0 – d 0 ) = w – w 0 ( 7 ) where k c is the spring constant of the cantilever , ( z 0 , d 0 ) are the coordinates of the contact point , and ( z 1 , d 1 ) are the coordinates of the point of zero applied force ( see Figure 2 ) . The transformed vari - able w = z – d is introduced for simplification . The adhesive force is then related to the reference points by Equation ( 8 ) : 578 Lin et al . – eXPRESS Polymer Letters Vol . 1 , No . 9 ( 2007 ) 576 – 584 F ad = k c ( d 1 – d 0 ) ( 8 ) Substitution of Equations ( 5 ) through ( 8 ) into Equation ( 1 ) recasts the force - indentation relation into a form appropriate for fitting the raw data and extracting the values of E . 4 . Results and discussion In this section , we first develop a nonlinear contact mechanics model that describes the force - indenta - tion relationship for rubber - like materials . The der - ivation is based on the concepts discussed in the theoretical section and on the Mooney - Rivlin for - malism . A comparison is then made between the predictions of this model and the experimental data obtained for the PVA hydrogels . 4 . 1 . Formulation of a nonlinear contact mechanics model The Hertz and DMT equations are based on the the - ory of linear elasticity and therefore subject to its inherent limitations , including the requirement of geometric ( i . e . , stress - strain ) linearity . As previ - ously mentioned , it may not always be feasible to limit indentation depths to the linear regime . In the realm of rubber elasticity , many phenomenological theories have been developed . One of the simplest and perhaps most well - known of the stress - strain relations derived from these theories is the Mooney - Rivlin equation ( 9 ) [ 12 ] : σ = 2 C 1 ( λ – λ – 2 ) + 2 C 2 ( λ – λ – 3 ) ( 9 ) where σ is the stress , λ is the extension ratio , and C 1 and C 2 are constants . We wish to use Equa - tion ( 9 ) as the basis of a force - indentation relation - ship . To that end , we define the effective or average stress and strain due to indentation . The indentation stress , σ * , can be set equal to the mean contact pres - sure ( force over the contact area ) , given by Equa - tion ( 10 ) : ( 10 ) The indentation strain , ε * , is defined by Equation ( 11 ) [ 13 ] : ( 11 ) For linear elastic ( Hertzian ) contact , it can be seen that σ * and ε * are linearly proportional , giving a Hookean equation ( 12 ) of the form : ( 12 ) In order to derive force - indentation relations for materials obeying the constitutive Equation ( 9 ) , disparities in sign conventions for stress and strain between Equations ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) must first be resolved . In Equation ( 9 ) , standard engineering convention applies , with stresses and strains posi - tive in tension . This implies that λ > 1 in tension and λ < 1 in compression . Because indentation is viewed as a compressive process , the sign conven - tion for σ * and ε * are opposite from the standard convention . Replacing σ with – σ * and λ with ( 1 – ε * ) in Equation ( 9 ) yields Equation ( 13 ) : ( 13 ) 579 Lin et al . – eXPRESS Polymer Letters Vol . 1 , No . 9 ( 2007 ) 576 – 584 2 * a F π = σ R a = ε * ) 1 ( 3 4 with , 2 * * ν − π = ζ ζε = σ E ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ ε + ε − ε + ε − ε + ε − ε + ⎟⎟⎠⎞ ⎜⎜⎝⎛ ε + ε − ε ε + ε − ε = ε σ * 2 * 3 * 4 * * 2 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 3 * * 2 * 3 * 1 * * 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 B B Figure 2 . A typical set of deflection - displacement curves in extension and retraction with negligible adhe - sive interactions in extension and significant adhesion upon retraction . The two curves are offset from each other for clarity ; they are plot - ted without offset in the inset . In extension , only the contact point ( z 0 , d 0 ) is required to transform the data to force vs . indentation . In retraction , two reference points are needed – the contact point and the point of zero applied force ( z 1 , d 1 ) . The schematics show the bending of the can - tilever at the reference points and at the point of maximum indentation . where the constants C 1 and C 2 no longer hold the same meaning and have been replaced with B 1 / 2 and B 2 / 2 , respectively . Substitution of Equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) into Equa - tion ( 13 ) results in a relationship between indenta - tion force and contact radius . To obtain a more practicable equation in terms of force and indenta - tion , the relationship between contact radius and indentation is required . Assuming that the manner in which a varies with δ is independent of material linearity , we use Equation ( 2 ) as a first approxima - tion . Algebraic manipulation yields Equation ( 14 ) : ( 14 ) where F = F ad + F n when adhesive interactions are present . At infinitesimal strain or indentation depth , Equation ( 1 ) applies , and Equation ( 14 ) reduces to Equation ( 15 ) : ( 15 ) where E 0 is the initial Young’s modulus and ν = 0 . 5 for incompressible materials . Equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) comprise an approximate Mooney - Rivlin con - tact mechanics model that can be applied to the indentation of rubber - like materials ; elastic proper - ties of the samples are represented by the extracted Young’s moduli . The model reduces to the neo - Hookean form when B 2 = 0 . Justification for the assumption that the contact radius is independent of material linearity can be found in the results of the finite element analyses performed by Mesarovic and Fleck [ 14 ] on the indentation behavior of elastic - plastic solids . Such materials undergo strain hardening in compression , as do Mooney - Rivlin solids . Under uniaxial ten - sion , the Ramberg - Osgood hardening relationship employed in the finite element study has the form of Equation ( 16 ) : ( 16 ) where ε 0 and σ 0 are the strain and stress at the yield point , respectively . The strain - hardening exponent m defines the deformation behavior , with m = 1 rep - resenting linear elastic response and m → ∞ corre - sponding to elastic - ideally plastic response ; an intermediate value of m = 3 was used by Mesarovic and Fleck in their study . The mathematical similar - ity between the Mooney - Rivlin and Ramberg - Osgood equations is demonstrated in Figure 3 , where stress - strain curves are shown for a typical hardening material with linear Young’s modulus of 100 kPa and a linear strain limit of approximately 15 % . Mesarovic and Fleck found that the contact radius followed the form of Equation ( 2 ) beyond the yield point ; with further indentation , contact radii predicted by Equation ( 2 ) became increasingly smaller than the actual values .

Comparison of the model with experi - mental results Results of the macroscopic compression and AFM indentation tests are summarized in Table 1 . There is generally good agreement between the macro - scopic Young’s moduli and values obtained from the small strain and large strain analyses of the AFM indentation data . Adhesion during indenta - tion was evident only in the retraction strokes , prior to tip - sample separation . The small strain analysis was performed by truncating the datasets at an indentation strain of about 15 % and applying Equa - tion ( 1 ) . The large strain analysis using Equa - tion ( 14 ) was performed without data truncation . In fitting the macroscopic compression data with Equation ( 9 ) over a large range of λ ( 0 . 6 < λ < 1 ) , it was found that C 2 ~ 0 within the experimental error . This is consistent with the macroscopic , neo - Hookean behavior of PVA gels tested under similar conditions [ 17 , 18 ] and of lightly crosslinked , highly swollen gels in general [ 12 , 19 ] . Values of the Mooney - Rivlin fitting parameters B 1 and B 2 from fitting of the indentation data with Equa - tion ( 14 ) are summarized in Table 2 . At the micro - scopic length scale probed by the AFM , the large variability in B 2 may reflect inhomogeneities due 581 Lin et al . – eXPRESS Polymer Letters Vol . 1 , No . 9 ( 2007 ) 576 – 584 Table 1 .

The linear elastic fits have been extended beyond 15 % strain for comparison ( extended portions are shown in gray ) . Plots of the residual errors for each fit are displayed in the inset . likely to local differences in polymer concentration . Equation ( 14 ) therefore allows us to detect these structural nonuniformities and quantifies the local deviation from neo - Hookean behavior . It should be mentioned that the Mooney - Rivlin formalism is not a constitutive material law since the values of the material constants may depend on the mode of deformation . Hence , extreme caution should be exercised when applying Equations ( 9 ) and ( 14 ) . Strains at maximum indentation depth were approximately 22 % and 30 % for the 12 % and 6 % gels , respectively . The 12 % gel exhibited a linear regime that was significantly wider than that of the 6 % gel , as illustrated by the examples in Figures 4 and 5 . In fact , the residual errors shown in Figure 4 indicate that the 12 % gel behaved linearly up to the maximum indentation depth . Strain hardening in the 6 % gel is manifested in the poor fit of Equa - tion ( 1 ) to the data beyond ~ 15 % strain , as shown in Figure 5 . Regardless of the degree of nonlinear - ity at maximum indentation depth , Equation ( 14 ) was found to be a good fit of both extension and retraction data . Compared to the small strain , linear analysis using Equation ( 1 ) , the large strain analy - sis using Equation ( 14 ) yielded smaller differences between Young’s moduli in extension and retrac - tion . We attribute the improved agreement to the inclusion of more data points in the large strain analysis . Synthetic gels prepared by the crosslinking of poly - mer chains in solution can be considered isotropic and homogeneous at macroscopic length scales . However , at the submicron level probed by the AFM , spatial variations in mechanical properties due to local concentration nonuniformities become detectable . In biological materials , such variations are much more pronounced , even over regions as small as a few tens of square nanometers . AFM nanoindentation has therefore become a powerful technique for generating elasticity maps of living cells [ 20 – 25 ] and the extracellular matrix [ 26 – 31 ] . To illustrate the differences between relatively homogeneous synthetic polymer gels and biologi - cal tissues , Young’s modulus maps from 6 % and 12 % PVA gels and from a region of mouse articular cartilage are shown in Figure 6 . Over regions of comparable size , local Young’s moduli of the PVA gels varied over a much narrower range ( approxi - 582 Lin et al . – eXPRESS Polymer Letters Vol . 1 , No . 9 ( 2007 ) 576 – 584 Figure 5 .

The variability in stiffness in the carti - lage corresponds to a high degree of local inhomo - geneity , which is a characteristic feature of many biological tissues . 5 . Conclusions In rubber - like materials , measurements of elastic moduli using the AFM have been mostly limited to indentation in the linear stress - strain regime . While small strain nanoindentation is practicable in many situations , excessive noise in the vicinity of the contact point can hinder and even preclude its accu - racy in other cases . Hence , an easily implemented , large strain contact mechanics model is desirable . The Mooney - Rivlin force - indentation relationship introduced here satisfies this criterion and was shown to be accurate in modeling the indentation behavior of swollen PVA gels . In the AFM probing of any material that exhibits rubber elasticity , it can be applied without the need to limit indentation strains to the linear regime .
