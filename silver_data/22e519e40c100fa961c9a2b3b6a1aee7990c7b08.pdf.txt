In many superfamily members , Ca 2 1 binding induces a conformational change in the EF - hand motif , lead - ing to the activation or inactivation of target pro - teins . In calmodulin and troponin C , this is de - scribed as a change from the closed conformational state in the absence of Ca 2 1 to the open conforma - tional state in its presence . It is now clear from structures of other EF - hand proteins that this ‘‘closed - to - open’’ conformational transition is not the sole model for EF - hand protein structural re - sponse to Ca 2 1 . More complex modes of conforma - tional change are observed in EF - hand proteins that interact with a covalently attached acyl group ( e . g . , recoverin ) and in those that dimerize ( e . g . , S100B , calpain ) . In fact , EF - hand proteins display a multi - tude of unique conformational states , together con - stituting a conformational continuum . Using a quan - titative 3D approach termed vector geometry mapping ( VGM ) , we discuss this tertiary structural diversity of EF - hand proteins and its correlation with target recognition .

Key words : calcium signaling ; EF - hand protein ; con - formational change INTRODUCTION Over 200 proteins serving as both Ca 2 1 sensors and buffers in eukaryotes are known to contain one or more so - called EF - hand motifs . 1 First discovered in the crystal structure of parvalbumin , 2 the EF - hand motif is a helix - loop - helix structure with a Ca 2 1 ion bound to the interheli - cal loop region . Upon Ca 2 1 binding , the sensor proteins undergo conformational change and in turn regulate a vast number of target proteins ; calmodulin ( CaM ) alone regu - lates many intracellular targets such as CaM kinases , myosin light chain kinases and calcineurin ( reviewed in Crivici and Ikura 3 ) , and NMDA receptor . 4 Other EF - hand proteins are more specialized . Troponin C ( TnC ) serves as a Ca 2 1 sensor in muscle cells . 5 Recoverin , expressed solely in retinal rod cells , acts as a Ca 2 1 sensor in vision . 6 Guanylate cyclase activating proteins ( GCAPs ) speciﬁcally activate retinal guanylate cyclases only at low Ca 2 1 levels ( . 100 nM ) . 7 Some of these EF - hand proteins , such as S100B and recoverin , have been implicated in a number of neurological diseases includingAlzheimer’s disease , Down’s syndrome , epilepsy and retinal degradation . 8 – 10 Members of the EF - hand superfamily employ the same helix - loop - helix motif to carry out their diverse biological functions . This motif has been quantitatively character - ized in the past by one angle between the two helices . 11 – 13 In this review we compare the structures of 90 EF - hand motifs in 31 proteins by a newly developed method which enables us to deﬁne the conformational variation of EF - hand motifs in a more precise manner . Our analysis provides a novel way of characterizing an EF - hand ( or any other two - helix structural motif ) , highlighting trends in conformational changes and uncovering subtle differences between EF - hand motifs that were previously considered similar . This review intends to provide a better understand - ingofhowhomologousproteinsusedifferentstructuralcharac - teristics for their speciﬁc roles in biological functions . VECTOR GEOMETRY MAPPING ANALYSIS The interhelical angle between the two helices has been widely used to describe the conformational state of an EF - hand motif . However , the information provided by this angle alone is insufficient to describe the complete move - ment of one helix with respect to the other . The Vector Geometry Mapping ( VGM ) method 14 directly compares the position of the exiting ( sequentially second ) helix of an EF - hand with respect to its entering ( sequentially ﬁrst ) helix by orienting the two helices in a coordinate system Abbreviations : CaM , calmodulin ; TnC , troponin C ; VGM , vector geometrymapping ; RMSD , rootmeansquaredeviation ; CNA , calcineu - rin A ; CNB , calcineurin B ; ELC , myosin essential light chain ; RLC , myosin regulatory light chain ; GCAP , guanylate cyclase activating protein ; EH domain , Eps15 homology domain ; PLC , phospholipase C ; skMLCK / smMLCK , skeletal / smooth muscle myosin light chain ki - nase ; CaMKII , Ca 2 1 - CaM dependent protein kinase II ; NPF motif , Asn - Pro - Phe motif .

The coordinate system is arbitrarily deﬁned ; in this study , the ﬁrst EF - hand in sequence of Ca 2 1 - free calmodulin ( apo - CaM EF1 ) is used as a reference . The two helices of apo - CaM EF1 are represented by vectors , with the endpoints deter - mined by averaging the coordinates of the ﬁrst or last eleven backbone N , C a and C 8 atoms on either end of the helix . The 1 z axis is deﬁned along the vector representing the entering helix of apo - CaM EF1 and the 1 x axis is deﬁned by the N - terminal end of its exiting helix vector . The intersection of the x and z axes deﬁnes the origin . The entering helices of the other EF - hands studied are then superimposed on that of apo - CaM EF1 ( root mean square deviation , RMSD 5 0 . 55 6 0 . 48 Å ) . Superposition of multiple NMR structures also yields similar values ( 0 . 68 6 0 . 52 Å ) . In principle the basis for superposition could be set to either the entering or exiting helix , although the use of the latter was less successful ( 3 . 93 6 4 . 66 Å ) , mainly owing to partial disorder of the exiting helix in some EF - hands ( e . g . , CaM EF4 , myosin regulatory light chain EF4 ) . Three angles quantify the exiting helix vector’s geomet - ric position relative to the entering helix . u is the angle between the entering and exiting helices and is 180° less the interhelical angle previously described . 15 § , the horizon - tal plane angle , is measured between the 1 x axis and the xy projection of the exiting helix vector , counterclockwise about the 1 z axis . v is the counterclockwise angle of rotation about the exiting helix vector axis and is a descriptive measure of conformational change . The posi - tion of the exiting helix is further described by the coordinate of its N - terminal end . Because all vectors are deﬁned in the same coordinate system , the VGM program ( available at http : / / diana . oci . utoronto . ca / ikura / datasoft . html ) can also provide other geometry - based parameters such as helix lengths and interhelical distances . Members of the EF - hand superfamily display great variability in their structures , 16 , 17 even among homologs of one subfamily ( e . g . , skeletal and cardiac muscle TnC 13 ) . This diversity appears as a non - discrete range of conforma - tions , as illustrated by the VGM approach ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . In most EF - hands , the exiting helix points ( N to C termini ) in the same general direction in the horizontal plane as those of CaM and TnC in the Ca 2 1 - free and Ca 2 1 - loaded states ( Fig . 2 ) . The interhelical distance between inner endpoints ( the C - terminal end of the entering helix and the N - terminal end of the exiting helix ) is 11 . 8 6 1 . 6 A˚ ( Fig . 3 ) . The average ( x , y , z ) coordinate of the exiting helix’s N - terminal end is ( 8 . 6 6 3 . 5 , 1 . 0 6 4 . 2 , 2 1 . 9 6 2 . 5 ) ( Fig . 3 ) , compared to ( 10 . 9 , 0 , 0 ) for the reference EF - hand . The conformational space is deﬁned by ranges of the interheli - cal angle u ( 89 % within the range 30° , u , 90° ) and horizontal plane angle § ( 80 % within the range 80° , § , 140° ) . The propensity of most of the EF - hands to assume this geometric arrangement is governed by the sequence of the interhelical Ca 2 1 binding loop , and the packing of side chains within and between EF - hands . Twenty - ﬁve EF - hands from nine proteins ( for which both the apo and Ca 2 1 - bound forms are available ) showed variable magnitudes of Du ( 2 8° , Du , 60° ) , D § ( 2 66° , D § , 19° ) and Dv ( 2 66° , Dv , 18° ) . Many of the EF - hands studied had negative Dv values ( a decrease in v ) , indicating that upon Ca 2 1 binding , the exiting helices of these EF - hands undergo a clockwise change in orientation with respect to the entering helix . Evidently there are some trends in Ca 2 1 - induced conformational change ; be - low we consider several well - characterized examples that shed light on the diversity in conformation and function . OPEN , CLOSED AND SEMI - OPEN CONFORMATIONS EF - hands occur in interacting pairs to form stable structural domains and typically undergo a conforma - tional change upon binding Ca 2 1 ( Fig . 4 ) . As ﬁrst proposed for TnC 18 and later for CaM , 15 , 19 , 20 these domains exhibit a ‘‘closed conformation’’ ( in which the helices of the EF - hand are closer to anti - parallel ) in the Ca 2 1 free state , and an ‘‘open conformation’’ ( in which the helices are more perpen - dicular ) when bound to Ca 2 1 ( Fig . 2a ) . The large conforma - tional change is characterized by a large opening of the helices ( 26° , Du , 60° ) and a swing clockwise about the entering helix ( 2 34° , D § , 0° ) . As a result , two large hydrophobic surfaces are exposed for target interaction . The exiting helices of all EF - hands but CaM EF2 also undergo large clockwise twist motion ( 2 59° , Dv , 2 40° for CaM , 2 2° for EF2 ; 2 35° and 2 12° for TnC ) . In addition , calcineurin B ( CNB ) , a CaM subfamily member which associates with calcineurin A ( CNA ) to form protein phosphatase calcineurin , displays the open conformation Fig . 1 .

Details of a Ca 2 1 - induced conformational change for CNB are unknown , since the Ca 2 1 - free structure has not yet been determined . A third conformational state has been identiﬁed in essential and regulatory light chains ( ELC and RLC ) of myosin . 21 The C - terminal domain EF - hands ( EF3 and EF4 ) assume a unique semi - open conformation , in which the two helices of each EF - hand appear closer together than in the open conformation , but further apart than in the closed conformation . Interaction between the light chains and the heavy chain of myosin serve to stabilize the conformation . The EF - hands of the semi - open domains ( which do not bind Ca 2 1 ) show much less structural congruence in comparison to the EF - hands of the closed and open conformations , implying a kind of ‘‘micro’’ - diversity within the semi - open conformation ( Fig . 2c ) . The exiting helices of ELC EF3 and EF4 and RLC EF3 point in very different directions , but are all positioned halfway between those of the closed and open EF - hands . Con - versely , RLC EF4 appears better aligned with the group of open EF - hands . Quantitatively , the C - terminal EF - hands of the light chains are represented by a large range of § , which encompasses the § ranges of the closed and open EF - hands , while the range for u overlaps that for the open EF - hands ( data not shown ) . Incidentally , the N - terminal domain ( EF1 and EF2 ) of the RLC is considered to be of open conformation and that of the ELC is considered closed , 21 , 22 which is supported by VGM analysis . However , ELC EF2 is unusual in spatial orientation when compared to CaM and TnC’s closed conformation , and also when compared to other EF - hand conformations . This is re - ﬂected in the lowest § value of all hands ( 2 161° ) . ELC EF2 is the only EF - hand of the light chains that makes no contact with the heavy chain and consequently , of the four light chain domains , the N - terminal domain of the ELC is the most weakly anchored to the heavy chain . 22 EF - HAND - MYRISTOYL INTERACTION In addition to Ca 2 1 - dependent protein - protein interac - tions , the EF - hand appears to recognize non - peptide enti - Fig . 3 .

For example , the EF - hand acts as a lipid - binding motif in the recoverin subfamily of over a dozen neural proteins containing four EF - hands and a myristoyl ( C14 : 0 ) or other acyl group at the N - terminus . 23 ( More recently , it was reported 24 that CaM also binds an N - terminal myris - toylated portion of CAP - 22 / NAP - 22 . ) In Ca 2 1 - free recov - erin , the covalently attached myristoyl group is seques - tered in a hydrophobic cavity formed by the helices of EF1 and EF2 and the entering helix of EF3 ( Tanaka et al . 25 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . The binding of Ca 2 1 to EF2 and EF3 leads to structural changes in the EF - hands ( Fig . 2d ) that trigger extrusion and exposure of the myristoyl group , 26 termed the calcium - myristoyl switch , and enable recoverin to bind to membranes . The N - terminal domain residues that interact with the myristoyl group in the Ca 2 1 - free protein become solvent exposed in Ca 2 1 - bound recoverin and may be available for binding to membrane targets . Although EF1 does not bind Ca 2 1 , its helices exhibit a large Ca 2 1 - induced opening and twist movement ( Du 5 49° , Dv 5 2 45° ) . This large Ca 2 1 - induced structural change results from EF1’s close packing arrangement and association with EF2 as described by the Herzberg - Moult - James model . 27 Undergoing minor Ca 2 1 - induced changes in u , § , and v , EF4 interacts closely with the C - terminal K - helix of recoverin , 26 which locks EF4 into a permanent open confor - mation and probably prevents its binding to targets . The Ca 2 1 - induced structural changes in the EF - hands of recoverin are unique due to their interaction with the myristoyl group . It is reasonable to expect that other recoverin subfamily members will also be structurally affected by the presence of their acyl group . Ultimately the acyl group will inﬂuence the manner by which these proteins bind their targets . The recently determined struc - tures of unmyristoylated , Ca 2 1 - bound GCAP - 2 and neuro - calcin are generally similar to that of myristoylated Ca 2 1 - bound recoverin , 28 but bind Ca 2 1 at EF4 , in addition to EF2 and EF3 . Neurocalcin also forms a dimer ( discussed below ) . Further , GCAP - 2 is believed to activate its target in the Ca 2 1 - free state , in contrast to other members of the recoverin subfamily . 28 Further studies are needed to clarify the situation . DIMERIC EF - HAND PROTEINS EF - hand proteins often consist of multiple domains , each containing a pair of EF - hands . In addition , some EF - hand protein superfamily members are naturally found as dimers of identical domains or closely related domains , introducing another dimension of complexity in molecular architecture . There are several dimeric proteins for which structures are known : S100 proteins S100B , calcyclin , psoriasin and p11 , as well as calpain and neurocalcin . Proteins of the S100 subfamily contain two EF - hands of varying Ca 2 1 binding affinity and form homodimers or heterodimers with other S100 proteins ( Fig . 6a ) , with the exception of calbindin D 9k . 29 – 31 Ca 2 1 sensor proteins calcy - clin 32 – 34 and S100B 35 – 40 are dimeric in both the presence and absence of Ca 2 1 . Psoriasin is a dimer in the Ca 2 1 - bound form , although it may only bind Ca 2 1 at EF2 ( Brodersen et al . 41 ) . p11 is also a dimer , but cannot bind Ca 2 1 due to mutations in the Ca 2 1 - binding loops of the EF - hands . 42 In all cases , the dimeric interface involves the entering helix of EF1 and the exiting helix of EF2 . This interface varies from , 2 , 400 Å 2 for Ca 2 1 - bound human S100B and psoriasin , to , 3 , 200 Å 2 for apo calcyclin , 43 and the S100 dimer is probably a tight association ( K d , 10 2 9 M ) . 44 The EF - hand exiting helices of the dimeric S100 pro - teins are represented by vectors in the same region of the plot ( 80° , § , 110° , 50° , u , 80° ) ( Fig . 2e ) . The most notable exceptions are the exiting helices of apo - calcyclin EF2 and apo - S100B EF2 which are sloped in an opposite direction ( Fig . 3 ) . Consequently the § values are negative ( 2 53 . 1° and 2 117 . 8° for rabbit calcyclin and rat S100B respectively ) and the u values more accurately represent the angle formed by the other helical endpoints ( i . e . , the N - terminal end of the entering helix and the C - terminal end of the exiting helix ) . Upon binding Ca 2 1 , these EF - hands are reoriented ( D § , 200° ) into the aforementioned common region , undergoing the largest conformational change observed among all EF - hands studied . With the exiting helix of EF2 fully involved in the dimer interface , the conformational change observed in EF2 of both calcyclin and rat S100B are in fact due to Ca 2 1 - induced movement of the entering helix with respect to the rest of the molecule . 38 This results in an exposure of a relatively large hydrophobic surface which is likely re - quired for target interaction . The recently determined structures of p11 and its complex with an annexin II peptide have shown that without binding Ca 2 1 , this pro - tein may mimic a Ca 2 1 - bound S100 protein structure that is ‘‘complex - ready’’ . 42 Calbindin D 9k is the most evolutionarily distant member of the S100 subfamily and is the only known monomeric Fig . 5 . N - terminal domain of recoverin ( 1IKU ) . In the Ca 2 1 - free state , the myristoyl group ( shown as a space - ﬁlling model ) is sequestered in a hydrophobic pocket formed by EF1 , EF2 and the entering helix of EF3 ( not shown ) . 503 EF - HAND CONFORMATIONAL DIVERSITY S100 protein . This may be because the two helices essen - tial for dimer formation in S100 proteins are considerably shorter . 45 Calbindin D 9k undergoes very little conforma - tional change upon Ca 2 1 binding ( D § 5 1 . 8° and 16 . 0° , Du 5 2 8 . 4° and 2 7 . 0° for EF1 and EF2 , respectively ) , consistent with its buffering function . However , a similarity in local - ity of the largest structural change ( the entering helix of EF2 ) may indicate that calbindin D 9k has evolved from an ancestral sensor protein . 46 The small subunit domain VI of calpain is unique , containing ﬁve EF - hands , the ﬁfth of which is essential for dimer formation ( Fig . 6b ) and Ca 2 1 activation of cal - pain . 47 , 48 The dimer interaction surface is much more extensive ( 4 , 269 Å 2 ) in comparison to the S100 proteins , and the dissociation constant likely much smaller ( K d , 10 2 12 to 10 2 15 M for the calpain subunit heterodimer ) , 49 implying that the calpain dimer is more stable than the S100 dimer . EF1 , EF2 , and EF3 bind Ca 2 1 , but little conformational change occurs ( Fig . 2f ) . The exiting helices of EF2 , EF3 , and EF5 are positioned in the same cluster in both Ca 2 1 - free and bound states . The position of EF4 is unusual ( Fig . 3 ) , as evident in low § values ( 15° and 22° for Ca 2 1 - free and bound , respectively ) , and in part allows for stabilizing interaction between two pairs of EF - hands ( EF1 - EF2 and EF3 - EF4 ) . 47 – 48 The position of EF1 may result from an atypically long linker between EF1 and EF2 , and its relatively larger conformational change ap - pears in concert with a movement of the EF1 - EF2 linker closer to EF3 and EF4 ( Blanchard et al . 47 ) . It has been recently shown that neurocalcin , a member of the recoverin subfamily , dimerizes both in crystal and in solution 50 ( Fig . 6c ) . The dimeric interface involves only four residues of EF3 , plus two residues from the linker between the two domains and one residue from the N - terminal helix . Dimerization is likely induced by Ca 2 1 binding ( JBA , unpublished ) . The hydrophobic surface of dimer interaction ( 2 , 309 Å 2 ) is comparable to that of the S100 proteins . Given neurocalcin’s sequence similarity to GCAP , it has been proposed that GCAP may also be dimeric . 28 Clearly , proteins from different subfamilies use different mechanisms for dimerization . Although there is still much to be revealed about these proteins and their siblings , this diversity in dimerization is likely to enable EF - hand proteins to effectively regulate multiple target proteins . A CONFORMATIONAL CONTINUUM As discussed thus far , there are several structural means by which an EF - hand protein can operate . With each new structure added to the ever - growing superfamily , it becomes more apparent that their structures and Ca 2 1 - induced conformational changes are as diverse as their functions . 11 This ‘‘continuum’’of conformational states is exempliﬁed by several EF - hand - containing proteins that are the sole structure - solved members of their subfamilies , or are larger proteins containing other non - EF hand domains . One of the latter is spectrin , whose subunit a contains two Ca 2 1 binding EF - hands that undergo moderate Ca 2 1 - induced conformational change 51 ( Fig . 2g ) . The movement of EF1’s exiting helix away from the entering helix is marked by a signiﬁcant decrease in § ( D § 5 2 46° ) , but little change in interhelical angle ( Du 5 2 1 . 5° ) . EF2 undergoes a large conformational change that may initiate Ca 2 1 binding to EF1 ( Lundberg et al . 52 ) . It is interesting to note that a - spectrin forms a heterodimer with b - spectrin , but the dimerization does not require the EF - hands of the a subunit . 53 Fig . 6 . Dimeric EF - hand proteins . a : Ca 2 1 - bound S100B ( 1QLK ) . b : Ca 2 1 - bound calpain ( 1DVI ) . c : Ca 2 1 - bound neurocalcin ( 1BJF , obtained from VD Kumar ) . 504 K . L . YAP ET AL . The recently determined structure of Cbl , a regulator of T - cell receptor signalling , contains a pair of EF - hands in its N - terminal domain , the second of which binds cal - cium . 54 The exiting helix of the ﬁrst EF - hand is sloped in an opposite direction ( § 5 2 80 . 9° ) , much like that of apo - calcyclin or apo - S100B EF2 . Although the helices of the second EF - hand are positioned similarly to those of Ca 2 1 - bound CaM or TnC ( data not shown ) , the Ca 2 1 ion is coordinated by ﬁve residues of the interhelical loop and surprisingly , supplemented by a glutamic acid of the neighboring four - helix - bundle domain . Other proteins—for which only one of the apo or Ca 2 1 - bound forms is available—also exhibit multifarious confor - mational states ( Figs . 2h – l ) . EF1 of oncomodulin and parvalbumin is a pairless , non - functioning hand , posi - tioned anti - parallel to the entering helix ( u 5 4° for both ) ( Fig . 2h ) . Such ‘‘closed’’ helices were not observed in other proteins . The helices of EF2 and EF3 , however , are almost as far apart as in the open conformation . Similarly , the Ca 2 1 - bound EF - hands’ exiting helices of BM - 40 ( Fig . 2i ) and of the C - terminal domain of sarcoplasmic calcium binding protein ( SCP ) ( Fig . 2j ) are spatially in the same region as the open conformation of Ca 2 1 - bound CaM and Ca 2 1 - bound TnC . The EF - hands’ exiting helices of N - terminal domain SCP point sharply away from the entering helices , as evidenced by the highest u values observed ( 121° and 122° respectively ) . This may be due to movement of the helices to avoid an energetically unfavor - able positioning within the domain , since EF2 does not bind Ca 2 1 ( Vijay - Kumar and Cook 55 ) . The Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain is found in some twenty proteins , and consists of a pair of EF - hands . In the second EH domain of the Eps15 protein , only the second EF - hand binds Ca 2 1 ( de Beer et al . 56 ) . In the Ca 2 1 - loaded state , the helices of both EF - hands are close together , much like the closed conforma - tion ( u 5 58° and 40° , respectively ) ( Fig . 2k ) , although EF2 points further away from its entering helix . Ca 2 1 - free phospholipase C - d 1 ( PLC - d 1 ) , a multi - domain protein , contains four EF - hands ( the ﬁrst of which contains a disordered polypeptide ) that do not display a similar conformation like the four EF - hands of apo - CaM ( Fig . 2l ) . However , structurally equivalent residues in PLC - d 1 to those involved in a CaM - peptide complex interact with the C - terminal , C2 domain of PLC - d 1 to form a smaller interface . 57 TARGET INTERACTIONS The Ca 2 1 - induced conformational change described above enables calcium sensor proteins to interact with target proteins in a Ca 2 1 - dependent manner , thereby activating or inhibiting the activity of the targets . From the struc - tures of the EF - hand protein - target complexes that have been solved to date , it appears that hydrophobic residues on the surface play a key role in interaction with the target protein . In Ca 2 1 - loaded CaM and TnC , each of the N - and C - terminal domains augments an exposed hydrophobic surface . In Ca 2 1 - loaded recoverin , many of the exposed hydrophobic residues in the N - terminal domain ( which are buried to form the myristoyl binding pocket in the Ca 2 1 - free state ) are homologous to those involved in CaM - target binding , 26 while the C - terminal domain is prevented from target binding by the K - helix . In both myosin light chain - heavy chain interactions , the overall architecture is simi - lar to that of the CaM - target interaction , despite the ELC and RLC formation of the ‘‘semi - open’’ conformation . 21 In dimeric proteins , a target - interacting surface might reside on each monomer , or it may be cooperatively created by the two monomers . A unique mechanism of target binding has been proposed for the EH domain , in which the target is believed to interact with a small hydrophobic patch on the surface of the EF - hand protein . 56 Affinities with which these proteins bind their targets vary greatly in accordance with the structural properties of the interaction ( Table I ) . Clearly , a complex with a larger buried surface shared between the protein and its target is more tightly bound . CNA ( the catalytic domain ) and CNB TABLE I .

Fellow subfamily members CaM and TnC also display large interfaces ( 2 , 491 – 2 , 929 Å 2 ) and high affinity ( K d , 10 2 9 2 10 2 10 M ) for their targets . Interestingly , CNB , CaM , and TnC all exhibit the open conformation in its Ca 2 1 - bound ( and thus ‘‘target - ready’’ ) form . The myosin light chains also bind with high affinity ( K d , 10 2 9 M ) and very large interact - ing surfaces ( 3 , 594 – 3 , 714 Å 2 ) . Other Ca 2 1 - free protein complexes bind with less affinity and , as might be postu - lated for lack of solved structures , with a smaller interface . The conformational state of these proteins greatly inﬂu - ences , if not determines , their target binding affinity . Further structural and thermodynamic studies may even - tually allow for the determination of a quantitative relation - ship between conformation , binding affinity , and speciﬁc - ity for target proteins . CONCLUSIONS EF - hand superfamily members clearly exhibit consider - able diversity in conformation that appears to be continu - ous rather than discrete . This is not surprising since it has previously been suggested that proteins in all classes of protein structure exhibit a ‘‘continuum of fold motifs . ’’ 58 Despite the conformational diversity in EF - hand proteins , there are clear propensities toward certain helix orienta - tions . In particular , the exiting helix of the EF - hand tends to form an acute angle with the entering helix , and favors a rather narrow range of positions on the plane horizontal to the entering helix . This propensity may be in part due to the numerous inter - and intra - residue contacts formed by or within the EF - hand . Diversity is also evident in Ca 2 1 - induced conformational change displayed by EF - hand proteins . CaM and TnC exhibit the largest changes , cal - pain and calbindin D 9k the smallest , and all others display - ing conformational changes of varying magnitude both among the EF - hands in the molecule , and among EF - hands of other proteins . Although limited structural infor - mation on protein - target complexes is available , there is appreciable correlation between EF - hand conformation and target binding affinity , with multiple domains provid - ing larger binding interfaces and thereby favoring stron - ger target binding . In light of the conformational diversity evident in known protein structures , EF - hand superfamily members appear to use a wide variety of molecular sur - faces to interact—usually in a Ca 2 1 - dependent manner— with various proteins , fatty acid alkyl chains and even with DNA . 59 Clearly , the movement of the ‘‘thumb’’ and ‘‘index ﬁnger’’helices within EF - hands can be ﬁne - tuned in order to accomplish various functions .
