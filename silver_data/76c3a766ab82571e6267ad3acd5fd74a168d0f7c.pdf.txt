However , the large number of mild or asymptomatic infections is likely to result in underestimation . Population‑based studies can provide valid estimates of the SARS‑CoV‑2 incidence and thus support health authorities to monitor the epidemiological situation and to initiate , maintain , strengthen or relax effective countermeasures . Methods : This study was conducted in Cologne , Germany . Six‑thousand randomly drawn Cologne residents , 18 years of age or older , were contacted by mail in March 2021 . Study envelopes contained a kit for self‑administered saliva sample and access details to a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics , previous positive SARS‑CoV‑2 RT‑ qPCR and completed COVID‑19 vaccinations . Participants were again invited for a second round in June 2021 , while those who declined participation were replaced by additional randomly drawn Cologne residents in order to reach a total of 6000 potential participants again . The saliva samples were sent to the laboratory by mail and tested for SARS‑ CoV‑2 using RT‑qPCR . The incidence estimates were adjusted for sensitivity and specificity of the test procedure and compared with the official numbers of new SARS‑CoV‑2 cases in the adult Cologne population . Results : The first surveillance round in March 2021 ( response rate : 34 . 08 % , N = 2045 ) showed a SARS‑CoV‑2 seven‑ day incidence of 85 cases per 100 , 000 adult Cologne residents ( 95 % CI : 9 to 319 ) . In the same period , the officially registered cases were 125 per 100 , 000 . The second surveillance round in June 2021 ( response rate : 36 . 53 % , N = 2192 ) © The Author ( s ) 2022 .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 Background After its first appearance in December 2019 in Wuhan , China , the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 ) spread across the globe in just a few weeks . In Germany , as in many other countries , the government introduced drastic counter - measures at an early stage of the pandemic in order to avoid overburdening the health system and especially the intensive care units . German politics and public health authorities are assessing the current course of the pandemic on the basis of various epidemiological indi - ces and indicators . They are important aids when mak - ing decisions about maintaining , tightening or releasing countermeasures that have been initiated . The number of newly confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections within a speci - fied period of time plays a crucial role among the key epidemiological indicators of the pandemic . It is usually reported as the accumulated number of positive SARS - CoV - 2 ‘Real Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reac - tion tests’ ( RT - qPCR ) over the past seven days and given per 100 , 000 inhabitants of the general population [ 1 , 2 ] . However , the accumulated number of positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - qPCR within the last seven days per 100 , 000 inhabitants might be rather a rough approximation of the true incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 . There is a risk that the official bodies underestimate the true extent of the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in the population on the basis of the accumulated positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - qPCR within the last seven days per 100 , 000 inhabitants [ 3 – 5 ] . The here presented ‘Cologne Corona Surveillance ( CoCoS ) Study’ was carried out to examine the risk of possible underestimation of the true incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 by the official figures . It used an active cluster surveillance strategy in the city of Cologne , Germany , at two time - points of the pandemic ( March 2021 and June 2021 ) . The study was planned and carried out in close cooperation with the Cologne health authorities . Methods A detailed description of the study setting , design , sample and procedure has already been published as study pro - tocol [ 6 ] . In summary , we combined a cross - sectional and longitudinal design . A random sample of 6000 Cologne citizens who were 18 years of age or older , was drawn from the municipal - registration office . The study con - sisted of two surveillance rounds ( March 16 to March 29 , 2021 and June 5 to June 18 , 2021 ) . All potential partici - pants drawn in the sample received a participation pack - age by post on March 16 and June 5 , 2021 . In addition to the letter of invitation to take part in the study , the pack - age contained a saliva sample kit and a pre - addressed , stamped UN3373 envelope . The saliva sample kit con - sisted of the saliva collection system , Salivette ® [ 7 ] . This system was recently validated as a method for self - col - lection of saliva samples in order to test for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 8 ] . To take part in the study , participants had to return their saliva sample during the 14 days of each surveillance round . For the second surveillance round , participants who declined informed consent in the first surveillance round were replaced in order to again reach 6000 poten - tial participants . The newly invited participants were drawn from a second sampling from the municipal - reg - istration office . Data on non - participation was collected . Basic soci - odemographic characteristics of the non - participants can be described , as these data were recorded as part of the sampling from the municipal - registration office . In addi - tion , non - participants were asked to provide reasons for not participating in the study . The invitation letter pro - vided for the following options to be ticked : ‘I do not con - sider the topic to be important’ / ‘I do not want to spend any time on the topic / I do not want to take the saliva sample’ / ‘I have concerns about data protection’ . Non - par - ticipants could also indicate other reasons in a free text field . Laboratory analysis The participants’ saliva samples were analysed at the Uni - versity of Cologne , Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne , Institute of Virology . All laboratory methods have also been described in detail in the study protocol that has already been published [ 6 ] . In brief , we determined SARS - CoV - 2 using RT - qPCR in a pool of each 10 samples , containing one ml of pooled saliva . For showed a seven‑day incidence of 27 per 100 , 000 adult Cologne residents ( 95 % CI : 1 to 142 ) , while the official figures for newly registered SARS‑CoV‑2 cases in the same period were 15 per 100 , 000 . Conclusions : The incidence estimates do not indicate relevant underestimation of new SARS‑CoV‑2 infections based on case notification . Regular use of the surveillance method developed here may nevertheless complement the efforts of the health authorities to assess the epidemiological situation .

Keywords : Coronavirus , COVID‑19 , Pandemic , Surveillance , Incidence , Underestimation Page 3 of 11 Oberste et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 SARS - CoV - 2 detection , either the COBAS 6800 ( Roche Diagnostics ) or Alinity m ( Abbott ) instruments equipped with their respective SARS - CoV - 2 detection kits were used . One ml of each sample of a positive pool were re - tested individually as described above . In a recently published meta - analysis , the sensitivity of RT - qPCR from saliva samples for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 was quantified as 83 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 74 . 7 - 91 . 4 % ) compared with the gold standard ( RT - qPCR from nasopharyn - geal swab ) [ 9 ] . The specificity of the test methods used here is close to 100 % [ 10 ] . Given the low prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the population , specificity is of central importance with regard to the accuracy of prevalence and incidence estimates [ 11 ] . In the present study , three positives were identified from a total of 4237 tests . Even if all of these had been false positive , this would still cor - respond to a specificity of the test method of 99 . 93 % ( 95 % CI 99 . 79 – 99 . 99 % ) . For analysis of the variants of SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples , 500 μl of saliva were used to purify nucleic acids with the MagNa Pure 96 automatic nucleic acid extrac - tion instrument and the Viral NA large volume kit . One - hundred μl were used for elution . Of the extracted RNA , 5 μl were used in a qPCR using the VirSNip SARS - CoV - 2 Spike A23063T N501Y , del21765 – 770 del HV69 / 70 and G23012A E484K assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( TIBMolBiol , Berlin , Germany ) . Melting analyses were performed in a LightCycler ® 480 II ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests are notifiable in Ger - many . Accordingly , the participants who tested posi - tive were reported to the authorities , who immediately informed them about their infection and initiated appropriate quarantine measures . The participants were informed in detail about this procedure as part of the consent to participate . Questionnaire Complementing the saliva sample , the participants were asked to share study - related data in a questionnaire during both surveillance rounds of the study . The par - ticipants could fill out the questionnaire independently online or with the help of the study team via telephone interview . A detailed description of the questionnaire can be found in the previously published study protocol [ 6 ] . The analytical focus in this article includes the sociode - mographic items of the questionnaire , such as gender , age , school education , employment status , primary citi - zenship , number of household members , as well as items on statements of previous positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - tests and possibly completed Corona Virus Disease 19 ( COVID - 19 ) vaccinations . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ( IBM Corp . , Version 26 . 0 , Armonk , NY , USA ) and the statisti - cal software R ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . The absolute and relative frequencies of basic sociodemographic characteristics of the two sam - ples of 6000 potential participants each were determined using the sampling data from the municipal - registration office . The absolute and relative frequencies of the more in - depth sociodemographic information from the ques - tionnaire were determined for each of the two partici - pant samples . The sociodemographic information of the potential participants and the participant samples were compared with the official statistics of the city of Cologne on Cologne’s adult general population . These data are open source [ 12 ] . From the information provided by the participants on previous positive PCR - tests for SARS - CoV - 2 , the propor - tion of participants who had gone through an infection was estimated for each of the two surveillance rounds . Weighting was given for the Cologne districts . Districts that were below the detection limit were estimated with 0 . 499 positive cases . We found this statistical measure to be necessary to improve the accuracy of our study data , as statistically the true incidence in those districts was slightly under our detection level , rather than zero . The estimates of the cumulative cases were compared with the official data up to the day before the beginning of the respective surveillance round ( March 15 and June 4 , 2021 ) . These data were made available by the health authorities of the City of Cologne upon our request . The requested data are provided in the Supplementary Material to this article . The absolute and relative frequencies of the information provided by the participants on COVID - 19 vaccinations were calculated for each sample of the two rounds of sur - veillance . These were compared with the official statistics of the Robert - Koch - Institute on Cologne’s adult general population up to the beginning of the respective surveil - lance round ( up to March 15 / June 4 , 2021 ) . These data are open source [ 13 ] . The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections was esti - mated as the quotient of the positives and the total sample of participants in each surveillance round and adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the test method using a Bayesian approach [ 14 ] . From the prevalence , the inci - dence was estimated as the rate of new cases per day by dividing by the average duration of illness of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 15 ] . In their review , Walsh and col - leagues [ 16 ] recently state that the average duration of illness for mild to moderate disease courses is around 10 days . From the estimate of the new cases rate per day , a 7 - day incidence per 100 , 000 participants was calcu - lated by multiplying the incidence estimate by 7 days and Page 4 of 11 Oberste et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 100 , 000 inhabitants . These figures were compared with the official information that the health authorities of the City of Cologne made available to us on request ( these data are also provided in the Supplementary Material to this article ) . The mean values of the daily new infections officially registered in the adult Cologne general popula - tion during the 14 - day study periods ( March 16 to 29 and June 5 to 18 , 2021 ) were used as a basis for the compari - son with the incidence estimates obtained from the study . Results Study recruitment The study flow chart is shown in Fig . 1 . The reasons why 276 ( 11 . 89 % ) of the 2322 participants who gave their con - sent to the first surveillance round of the CoCoS study , did not submit a valid saliva sample were incorrect han - dling of the Salivette ® saliva sample system , forgetting to pack the sample in the return envelope and sending the sample back only after the end of the surveillance round . Two - hundred - seven of the 3678 potential participants who decided not to part in the first surveillance round , made use of the opportunity to give reasons for not tak - ing part ( for most common reasons see Table 1 ) . The participants from the first surveillance round were also invited to the second surveillance round in June 2021 . The total number of re - contacted persons from the first surveillance round for participation in the sec - ond round was 2321 . They correspond to 38 . 68 % of the 6000 potential participants contacted for the second sur - veillance round . In order to fill the number of potential participants for the second surveillance round to 6000 Cologne citizens , a further 3679 ( 61 . 32 % ) were randomly drawn from the general adult population of Cologne . Of the 2321 people from the first round who were also invited to the second round , 1499 ( 64 . 60 % ) gave their consent to participate in the second surveillance round of the study . Of the people who were newly invited to the second round , 27 . 21 % gave their consent to partici - pate . The reasons why 308 ( 12 . 32 % ) of 2500 people who gave their consent to participation in the second surveil - lance round , did not provide a valid saliva sample were incorrect handling of the Salivette ® saliva sample system , forgetting to pack the sample in the return envelope and sending the sample back only after the end of the exami - nation round . Ninety - six of the 3499 potential participants in the sec - ond surveillance round who decided not to participate in the study gave reasons for not participating . ( for most common reasons see Table 1 ) . It is worth mentioning that not only the new partici - pants , but also those who had already participated in the first round , received detailed instructions on how to col - lect saliva with the Salivette ® system . In this way , failures due to errors in the collection of saliva should be further reduced . Of the 276 people who had agreed to participate in the first round but had not given a valid saliva sample , 140 people ( 50 . 72 % ) took part in the second round . Of these 140 people , 101 people ( 72 . 14 % ) submitted a valid saliva sample for the second round . Description of the study participants Sociodemographic characteristics and SARS - CoV - 2 spe - cific information of the 6000 randomly drawn citizens of Cologne invited to participate in each of the two surveil - lance rounds ( potential participants ) , of the actual partic - ipants in both surveillance rounds , as well as of the adult general population of Cologne is summarized in Table 2 . In both surveillance rounds , the actual participants of the CoCoS study were reasonably representative of the general adult population with regard to gender , age , size of household , employment status , and past SARS - CoV - 2 infections . However , the actual participants in both sur - veillance rounds of the CoCoS study had a higher level of schooling than the general adult population in Cologne ( 74 . 52 % / 75 . 32 % versus 55 . 00 % with High school gradu - ation ) . Moreover , people from Cologne with primary citizenship other than German were underrepresented among the actual participants in both surveillance rounds of the CoCoS study ( 7 . 38 % / 5 . 70 % versus 20 . 32 % with primary citizenship other than German ) . In the sec - ond surveillance round , the proportion of actual partici - pants who had already been vaccinated were higher than in the adult general population of Cologne ( vaccinated once : 79 . 82 % versus 49 . 00 % , vaccinated twice : 33 . 68 % versus 21 . 22 % ) ( for official figures concerning vaccination rates in Cologne see [ 13 ] ) . Prevalence and incidence of SARS‑CoV‑2 In the first surveillance round of the CoCoS study , three of the 2045 participants tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( viral loads ( measured in E - gene Ct values ) : 28 , 29 , and 36 , SARS - CoV - 2 variants : two times Alpha variant , one could not be determined because of a low viral load ) . None of the participants who tested positive in this study had previously been vaccinated against the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . Two of the three infected individuals were already known to the health authorities . The infected person unknown to the health authorities was informed imme - diately and reported to the health authorities . For the first surveillance round of the CoCoS study , the estimated prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections cor - rected for the sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory tests was 0 . 122 % of the adult Cologne population , with a 95 % confidence interval ranging from 0 . 013 to 0 . 457 % . From this , based on a disease duration estimate of ten days [ 16 ] , the incidence of new SARS - CoV - 2 infections Page 5 of 11 Oberste et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 per day was estimated to be 0 . 0122 % with a 95 % con - fidence interval that ranges from 0 . 0013 to 0 . 0457 % . The conversion to a 7 - day incidence resulted in 85 per 100 , 000 inhabitants with a 95 % confidence interval rang - ing from 9 to 319 per 100 , 000 inhabitants . From March 16 to March 29 , 2021 , the health authorities reported an average case notification rate of 125 per 7 days per 100 , 000 inhabitants . Corrected for the sensitivity and specificity of the lab - oratory test , a prevalence estimate of 0 . 038 % was calcu - lated for the second surveillance round of the study with a 95 % confidence interval ranging from 0 . 001 to 0 . 0202 % . The resulting incidence estimate is accordingly 0 . 0038 % Fig . 1 Flow chart of enrolment and testing at each surveillance round Page 6 of 11 Oberste et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0 . 0001 to 0 . 0202 % . The conversion to a 7 - day incidence estimate resulted in 27 per 100 , 000 inhabitants with a 95 % confidence interval that ranges from 1 to 142 . From June 5 to 18 , 2021 , the health authorities reported an average case notification rate of 0 . 0021 % or a 7 - day case notification rate of 15 per 100 , 000 inhabitants . Discussion The here presented CoCoS study provides two SARS - CoV - 2 incidence estimates for two very different phases of the pandemic ( high incidence phase in March 2021 and low incidence phase in June 2021 ) obtained from ran - domly drawn population samples . The estimates of the incidence of new SARS - CoV - 2 infections per day derived from the results of the study were close to the officially registered cases . In the first round of surveillance , the 7 - day incidence estimate was even slightly below the 7 - day incidence based on the officially registered cases , at 85 versus 125 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants . In the sec - ond surveillance round , the 7 - day incidence estimate was slightly higher than the 7 - day incidence based on the offi - cially registered cases , at 27 versus 15 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants . These findings do not indicate underestima - tion of the true incidence on the basis of the officially reg - istered cases , as has been shown in other studies [ 17 , 18 ] . The confidence intervals for the incidence estimates are very wide reflecting low precision of incidence esti - mates . To narrow down confidence intervals in future surveillance rounds sample size could be increased . This could be achieved with increasing the response rate .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 methods for taking saliva samples , such as the ‘lollipop method’ [ 21 ] , are currently evaluated for self - adminis - tered use [ 22 ] and could increase the response rates in future surveillance rounds . A striking observation is that the response rate was sig - nificantly lower among first time invitees of the second round compared to the first round ( 27 . 21 % versus 38 . 68 % ) . Since the procedure for recruiting new potential partici - pants was identical in the first and second round , exter - nal factors seem likely to be the explanation . During the period of the first investigation , comprehensive and free of charge SARS - CoV - 2 tests were not yet accessible for all citizens . The free PCR testing in the study may therefore have been an incentive to participate . This assumption is supported by the feedback from the non - participants in the first round who explain their non - participation with the possibility of regular tests apart from the study . When the second surveillance round was carried out , test cen - tres were introduced everywhere in Cologne , where every citizen could be tested easily and free of charge . In addi - tion , a large part of the Cologne population was already vaccinated in the second round , which , according to the feedback of non - participants , was often cited as a reason for not taking part in the second round . If the incentive of cost - free testing no longer works due to the citywide development of test centres and the increasing spread of COVID - 19 vaccinations , other incentives could stabilize and expand the response rate in future surveillance rounds . While monetary incen - tives are effective but often not affordable and difficult to implement in the context of population - based stud - ies , the response rate can be increased significantly with simple non - material incentives [ 23 ] . An effective non - material incentive is the feeling of participating in a meaningful study [ 24 ] . The invitation letter for the CoCoS study contained extensive information on the study procedure , the voluntary nature of participation , contact persons for queries and data protection , as well as instructions for taking the saliva sample . Possibly more information about the importance of the study as part of effective countermeasures to contain the pandemic would have increased the response rate even further . In future rounds , the relevance of the study should be stressed in the invitation letter . Reminders to participate are commonly seen as the most important factor in increasing the response rate of postal surveys [ 25 ] . Future surveillance rounds could send postcards or other means like text - messages ( if phone - number or e - mail address is available ) to the potential participants during the second half of the 14 - day surveil - lance period to remind them of the study and ask them to participate . This is all the more important that especially those potential participants who would otherwise remain under - represented are motivated to participate through reminder campaigns [ 26 ] . The CoCoS study combined cross - sectional and lon - gitudinal design . The same approach has been taken , for example , by the Robert - Koch - Institute ( RKI ) , the German national public health institute [ 27 ] . Partici - pants of previous waves are invited to continue , and drop - out is filled - up by new , randomly selected persons . This approach proved to be successful in terms of the response rate . While only 27 . 21 % of those newly invited to the second surveillance round took part , 64 . 60 % of those who were re - invited also took part in the second round . The approach not only to invite the people with consent to participate and a valid saliva sample to the second round , but all people who declared their partici - pation in the first round ( including those with consent but missed to send a valid saliva sample ) , proved to be successful . Most of the participants who did not submit a valid saliva sample for the first round took part in the second round and then managed to submit a valid saliva sample . This is presumably due to the detailed instruc - tions on how to collect the saliva sample that were given not only to the newly invited potential participants , but also to the re - invited potential participants in the second round . In future rounds , however , only those participants who did not submit a valid saliva sample in the previous round could receive detailed instructions on how to take saliva samples again and not all re - invited participants in general . In this way , printing and paper costs could be saved and the reading effort for the other re - invited par - ticipants could be reduced . The rolling cohort design also has disadvantages . Selec - tion effects can increase from round to round and threat the representativeness of the study sample . The validity of the incidence estimates depends on the representative - ness of the sample . Such a trend cannot be seen in the data from the first to the second surveillance round . However , of the 6 , 000 randomly drawn citizens of Cologne who were invited to take part in the study and who represented potential participants , only their name , address , age , and gender were available . These data could be obtained from the population register . Since only some of these poten - tial participants eventually took part in the study , no fur - ther data on the potential participants could be obtained . This applies to the size of the household , school educa - tion , employment status and primary citizenship , as well as past positive PCR tests or previous COVID - 19 vac - cinations . The lack of this data does not allow any reli - able conclusions to be drawn about possible selection effects . If the monitoring system developed as part of the CoCoS study is to be permanently established , a sentinel cohort should , however , be established that is representa - tive of the population and that is regularly examined . As Page 9 of 11 Oberste et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 an incentive to be included in this sentinel cohort , the great importance could be placed in the foreground non - materially and / or material monetary incentives could be pointed out ( e . g . , regular health check - ups , information of the current course of the pandemic ) . A critical examination of the representativeness of the participant samples in the two surveillance rounds shows that the participants differed from the general adult population in Cologne , especially in terms of level of school education and primary citizenship . Correla - tions between the level of education and the probability of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection have already been reported for the Cologne area . It was also shown that SARS - CoV - 2 infections are more common in Cologne districts with a high proportion of people with primary citizenship other than German [ 28 ] . Therefore , the under - representation of persons with lower levels of school education and of non - German citizens of Cologne could indicate an underestimation of the incidence in our study . One rea - son for the under - representation of people with lower school education in the participant sample could have been the length of the invitation letter . The letter of invi - tation is eight pages in its current form . The amount of text could put off less educated potential participants . A shorter and more concise version , perhaps with easy lan - guage , could motivate Cologne citizens with less school education to participate . In order to attract more people from Cologne with primary citizenship other than Ger - man to participate in future rounds , a reference to a cor - responding website in the mother tongues of the largest groups of foreigners in Cologne could be included in the invitation letter . To support a low threshold access to studies like CoCoS , multilingual options or cooperation with the city’s office for integration could be considered . The vaccination quota of the participants in the first round was similar to the officially reported vaccination quota for Cologne . In the second round , however , the participants had a markedly higher vaccination rate than officially reported [ 13 ] . The significantly higher vaccina - tion rate in the participant sample of the second surveil - lance round , compared with the official figures , could represent an actual difference to the normal population . This would be problematic as it can lead to biases in the incidence estimates . Vaccinated people can still carry the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . However , they become ill less often , for a shorter period of time and less severely than those who have not been vaccinated [ 29 ] . Furthermore , the Robert Koch Institute recently published a report on this with its own surveys in which it assumes 10 % and more vaccinations are not reported [ 30 ] . Another risk of bias caused by the higher proportion of vaccinated people in the study sample is difference in behaviour and atti - tudes towards non - pharmacological measures to prevent infections and exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 that are associ - ated with the COVID - 19 vaccination status . Some evi - dence suggests that those willing to be vaccinated also show greater compliance to non - pharmacological meas - ures [ 31 ] . However , other findings suggest that completed COVID - 19 vaccinations do not change behaviours that prevent infection or tend to decrease somewhat [ 32 ] . One limitation of the study is that it only includes peo - ple over the age of 18 . Children and adolescents play an important role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , especially due to the lack of approved vaccines or vaccinations that have not yet achieved full coverage [ 33 , 34 ] . However , children and adolescents represent a special clientele who could hardly be reached with a mail - based surveil - lance strategy conceived here . As part of the nationwide research network “Applied Surveillance and Testing” ( B - FAST ) , research on SARS - CoV - 2 surveillance for under and over 18 - year olds were subdivided . The pro - cedure of the surveillance strategy developed for children and adolescents was based on testing in kindergartens and schools and first results have been published and can be read there [ 21 ] . In future surveillance rounds , the here applied mail - based surveillance strategy for adults and the surveillance strategy based on visits in kindergartens and schools should be combined to get a clear picture of the COVID - 19 situation . Another limitation of the CoCoS study are the peri - ods of the two surveillance rounds of 14 days each . Since the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 can fluctuate consider - ably within 14 days and the probabilities of detecting acute SARS - CoV - 2 infections change , this constitutes another limitation . The surveillance strategy developed here , however , assumes a fixed incidence or simplifies the actual procedure in which all samples are taken on the same day . This brings additional bias in the estimate of the incidence . The establishment of a sentinel surveil - lance cohort , who know the processes well , could enable the investigation period to be further restricted to up to 3 days . This would significantly increase the accuracy of the estimate and the comparison with the official figures . Further , without blood drawing in surveys like ours , SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies cannot be determined , hence it remains unclear how many participants already gone through a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Therefore , no statement can be made about possible underestimation of cumulative cases . Conclusion The official numbers from the health authorities were within the 95 % confidence interval of the incidence estimates determined in the study in both surveillance rounds . Nevertheless , regular application of the surveil - lance method developed here could complement the Page 10 of 11 Oberste et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 1379 efforts of health authorities to assess the epidemiological situation . Regular surveillance or monitoring of popu - lation - based samples may give useful indicators both of distribution and determinants of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . On the one hand , the official registration of infection is to a large extent based on symptomatic cases only , thus giving rise to potential underreporting , the detection of which was key objectives of our study . On the other hand , non - response in random population - based samples can bias the results in both directions . Thus , we suggest that both designs shall be used complementary to each other . Our data complement statistics from health authori - ties to support the local implementation or adaptation of countermeasures in order to control or contain the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . To narrow down confi - dence intervals a larger number of people invited into the study could be effective . Moreover , incentives , remind - ers to participate , and an easier to handle saliva sampling method should be used to increase the response rate .
