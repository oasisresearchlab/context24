Wirtz • Udo Schumacher • Isabell Witzel • Dina Schu¨tze • Volkmar Mu¨ller Received : 13 November 2013 / Accepted : 2 April 2014 / Published online : 16 April 2014 (cid:2) Springer Science + Business Media New York 2014 Abstract Glycosylation of cellular proteins has important impact on their stability and functional properties , and gly - can structures strongly inﬂuence cell adhesion . Many enzymes are involved in glycoconjugate synthesis and deg - radation , but there is only limited information about their role in breast cancer progression . Therefore , we retrieved RNA expression data of 202 glycosylation genes generated by microarray analysis ( Affymetrix HG - U133A ) in a cohort of 194 mammary carcinomas with long - term follow - up information . After univariate and multivariate Cox regres - sion analysis , genes with independent prognostic value were identiﬁed . These were further analysed by Kaplan – Meier analysis and log - rank tests , and their prognostic value was validated in a second cohort of 200 tumour samples from patients without systemic therapy . In our ﬁrst cohort , we identiﬁed 24 genes with independent prognostic value , coding for sixteen anabolic and eight catabolic enzymes . Functionally , these genes are involved in all important gly - cosylation pathways , namely O - glycosylation , N - glycosyl - ation , O - fucosylation , synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids . Eighteen genes also showed prognostic signiﬁ - cance in chemotherapy - treated patients . In the second cohort , six of the 24 relevant genes were of prognostic sig - niﬁcance ( FUT1 , FUCA1 , POFUT1 , MAN1A1 , RPN1 and DPM1 ) , whereas a trend was observed for three additional probesets ( GCNT4 , ST3GAL6 and UGCG ) . In a stratiﬁed analysis of molecular subtypes combining both cohorts , great differences appeared suggesting a predominant role of N - glycosylation in luminal cancers and O - glycosylation in triple - negative ones . Correlations of gene expression with metastases of various localizations point to a role of glycan structures in organ - speciﬁc metastatic spread . Our results indicate that various glycosylation reactions inﬂuence pro - gression and metastasis of breast cancer and might thus represent potential therapeutic targets .

These glycoconjugates derive from glycosylation of proteins or lipids by stepwise cova - lent attachment of oligosaccharides . This co - or post - translational modiﬁcation has deep impact on protein folding and stability , transport and secretion , enzymatic activity , binding properties and antigenicity . Glycosylation has been reported to change signiﬁcantly during embryogenesis , and aberrant glycans due to defects in single glycosylation genes frequently lead to embryonic lethality [ 27 , 38 ] . Moreover , changesinglycanstructureshave been early detected in various malignancies including breast cancer [ 7 ] . Glycoproteins are used as tumour markers for diagnosis and tumour monitoring , and their use as diagnostic tools or therapeutic targets has been discussed [ 8 , 31 , 36 ] . The importance of glycosylation processes is reﬂected by the high number of about 700 genes involved in syn - thesis , modiﬁcation , binding and degradation of glycan structures . Based on the glycosylated molecules and the biochemical process , four main groups of glycans are dif - ferentiated : the O - glycans , N - glycans , glycosaminoglycans ( GAG ) and glycolipids . In addition , domain - speciﬁc O - or C - linked glycosylation of various proteins takes place , i . e . O - fucosylation of Ser / Thr residues in EGF repeats [ 26 ] . O - glycosylation involves post - translational attachment of N - acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) to OH - groups of ser - ine or threonine residues in mucin - type glycoproteins . This is followed by a stepwise attachment of a limited number of sugar monomers ( GlcNac , Gal , GalNAc , Fuc and N - acetylneuraminic acid ) by various glycosyltransferases leading to speciﬁc oligosaccharide structures [ 5 , 29 ] . Some of these structures are well - known tumour - associated epi - topes in carcinomas , i . e . sialyl - Lewis X or sialy - Lewis A , Tn antigen , or serve as tumour markers for monitoring of cancer development , i . e . CA19 - 9 . During N - glycosylation , an endoplasmatic reticulum - bound oligosaccharide is ﬁrst built by stepwise transfer of 2 GlcNAc , 9 mannose and 3 terminal Glc units to a mem - brane - bound dolichol anchor . This structure is then trans - ferred to amino groups of asparagine residues of nascent proteins and further modiﬁed by branching , trimming , fu - cosylation , etc . , leading to a wide variety of protein - bound oligosaccharide structures [ 29 ] . Both O - and N - glycans play an important role in adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium during inﬂammation . According to a widely accepted model , the same glycan groups are involved in adhesion of tumour cells to endothelia during metastasis [ 25 ] . Here , the binding to selectins plays an important role . Glycolipids are formed by covalent attachment of sugar residues to a ceramide in the external side of the outer cell membrane . According to their structure , glycolipids of the lacto - , ganglio - , neolacto - and globo - series can be differ - entiated . Several of these lipids are highly sialylated and are able to act as selectin ligands [ 33 ] . Glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) are characterized by long linear disaccharide chains attached to a protein backbone via a short linker oligosaccharide . They constitute a large fraction of the extracellular matrix and are crucial for cell motility and adhesion [ 1 ] . Depending on the nature of the disaccharide chains , the GAGs are divided into chon - droitin , heparin , keratan , dermatan and hyaluronan , the latter lacking a protein backbone . GAGs are modiﬁed by addition of sulphate by various sulfotransferases ( CHST’s ) , which are frequently important for their proper function . Chondroitin sulphate has been reported to inﬂuence metastasis due to its binding afﬁnity to P - and L - selectins [ 9 , 22 ] . Although various reports suggest that glycosylation has an important impact on tumour growth and progression , the knowledge about the prognostic and / or predictive role of glycan structures and glycosylation enzymes in human carcinomas is still very limited . Therefore , we studied mRNA gene expression of all anabolic or catabolic gly - cosylation genes which are represented on HG - U133A microarray chips in two well - characterized breast cancer cohorts . These results add novel information about the glycosylation reactions in mammary carcinomas which inﬂuence progression and metastasis and might thus rep - resent potential therapeutic targets . Materials and methods Patient cohorts In a ﬁrst screening approach , mRNA expression data obtained from primary breast cancer tissue samples from our hospital ( n = 194 ) were analyzed ( ‘Hamburg Cohort’ ) . Patients were treated between 1991 and 2002 and selected on the basis of tissue availability . One hundred six patients received anthracyclin - based adjuvant chemotherapy regi - mens ( mainly epirubicin / cyclophosphamide ( EC ) or cyclo - phosphamide / methotrexate / ﬂuorouracil ( CMF ) ) . Seventy - four patients received endocrine therapy only , 8 patients were treated by radiation without any systemic therapy and 4 patients remained untreated after surgery ( no information : 2 patients ) . Informed consent for the scientiﬁc use of tissue materials , which was approved by the local ethics committees ( for Hamburg : Ethik - Kommission der A¨rztekammer Hamburg , # OB / V / 03 ; for Mainz : Ethik - Kommission der Landesa¨rzte - kammer Rheinland - Pfalz , # 837 . 139 . 05 ( 4797 ) ) , was obtained from all patients . The study was performed in accordance to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and REMARK criteria [ 23 ] . No radiotherapy , neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy had been administered before surgery . 296 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2014 ) 145 : 295 – 305 123 T a b l e 1 G l y c o s y l a ti on e n z y m e s w it h i nd e p e nd e n t p r ogno s ti c i m p ac t i n b r ea s t ca n ce r p a ti e n t s G e n e s y m bo l A ff y m e t r i x no .

negative breast cancer patients , treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Johannes Gutenberg University , Mainz between 1988 and 1998 ( ‘Mainz Cohort’ ; [ 32 ] ) . Patients did not receive any sys - temic therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting , but treated either with modiﬁed radical mastectomy ( n = 75 ) or with breast - conserving surgery followed by irradiation ( n = 125 ) , and did not show evidence of distant metastases at the time of surgery . The clinical and histological char - acteristics of both cohorts are given in Supplementary Table S1 . Analysis of mRNA expression data Tissue samples were snap - frozen after surgery and stored in liquid nitrogen until use . RNA extraction , cDNA syn - thesis and microarray analysis were performed in the same laboratory for all samples as described [ 15 ] . Tumour cell content exceeded 40 % in all the samples , as shown by H & E staining of cryo - cut sections . The Affymetrix ( Santa Clara , CA , USA ) HG - U133A array and GeneChip System were used to quantify the relative transcript abundance in the breast cancer tissues . Hybridization intensity data were automatically acquired and processed by Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 . 0 software . Arrays were analyzed using MAS5 algorithm . All microarray data have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) under the following accession numbers . ‘Hamburg - Cohort’ : GSE26971 ( sam - ples GSM663775 - GSM663852 ) , GSE31519 ( samples GSM 782523 - GSM782529 ) , GSE31519 ( samples GSM782554 - GSM782568 ) , GSE46184 ( samples GSM1125783 - GSM112 856 ) ; ‘Mainz - Cohort’ : GSE11121 . Using previous publications and the GlycoGene data - base ( http : / / riodb . ibase . aist . go . jp / rcmg / ggdb / ) , we ﬁrst created a list of 241 anabolic and 60 catabolic glycosyla - tion enzymes . Glycan - binding proteins or glycan trans - porters were not included in this study . Of these 301 genes , 202 ( 316 probesets ) were represented on the Affymetrix HG - U133A array . A list of all relevant genes and probesets is given in Supplementary Table S2 . Statistics In a ﬁrst screening approach , we used univariate Cox regression analysis using continuous expression data and overall survival ( OAS ) or recurrence - free survival ( RFS ) . For selected genes , the cohort was divided into quartiles according to their expression values , and Kaplan – Meier analyses with log - rank tests were performed with the most suitable cut - off ( Q1 = lowest 25 % vs . higher 75 % , Q2 = median , Q3 = lowest 75 % vs . higher 25 % ) . A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine simultaneously the effects of multiple covariates on survival including nodal involve - ment ( positive vs . negative ) , tumour stage ( T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ) , histological grading ( G1 / G2 vs . G3 ) , oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status and the tested glycosylation enzyme . Associ - ations with clinical and histological variables were calcu - lated by v 2 tests using the groups given above , and correlations with age by Pearson test using continuous data . All p values are two sided , and p values of \ 0 . 05 were considered to indicate a signiﬁcant result . Due to the explorative character of our analysis , no multiple testing adjustment was considered . All analyses were performed using the SPSS 21 software . Results Enzymes of different glycosylation pathways are independent prognostic markers in breast cancer patients In a ﬁrst screening approach , the expression data of 316 probesets which are present on the HG - U133A genechip representing 155 anabolic and 47 catabolic glycosylation enzymes were extracted from the microarray data of 194 breast cancer samples from the Hamburg cohort . Probesets without or with only minimal expression in our samples ( mean expression values below 60 ; n = 64 ) were excluded from further analysis ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . With the remaining 252 probesets , a univariate Cox regression analysis was performed , using the continuous expression values . Interestingly , 71 probesets representing 64 genes were signiﬁcantly associated with RFS , OAS or both . The respective p values are given in Supplementary Table S3 . Since we were mainly interested in genes with independent prognostic value , we further performed multivariate Cox regression analysis including clinical stage , histological grading , nodal involvement , ER status and the respective expression values . Here , mRNA expression of 24 genes ( 25 probesets ) turned out to be of independent prognostic signif - icance in the Hamburg cohort . Among them were 16 anabolic and 8 catabolic glycosylation enzymes ( Table 1 ) . In order to further evaluate the signiﬁcance of these 24 genes , Kaplan – Meier analysis was performed . Again , log - rank tests resulted in signiﬁcant differences in RFS or OAS or both ( Table 1 ) . For ﬁve genes ( POFUT1 , FUCA1 , XYLT2 , GNS and MAN1A1 ) , high expression was asso - ciated with longer RFS and OAS , whereas expression of the other 19 genes correlated with a poor prognosis ( Fig . 1 ) . Regarding the glycan classes , most of the prognostic genes in the Hamburg cohort are involved in synthesis , 298 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2014 ) 145 : 295 – 305 123 modiﬁcation or degradation of GAGs ( n = 9 ) , seven genes are mainly involved in O - glycosylation , and ﬁve genes take part in N - glycosylation processes . The rest is involved in glycolipid synthesis ( n = 2 ) or other pathways . For further examination of the prognostic impact , expression data of the 24 relevant genes of our Hamburg cohort were obtained from an independent dataset of 200 breast cancer patients treated at the University of Mainz . In contrast to the ﬁrst cohort , this group included only node - negative , mostly ER - positive patients which were treated by surgery and radiation only without any systemic treat - ment . Since only \ 10 % of the patients had died at the end of the observation period , we only included RFS in our analysis ( Table 1 ) . Here , six of the 24 relevant genes turned out as signiﬁcant prognostic markers in Cox regression analysis ( FUT1 , FUCA1 , POFUT1 , MAN1A1 , RPN1 and DPM1 ) , whereas a trend was observed for three additional probesets ( GCNT4 , ST3GAL6 and UGCG ) . As observed in the Hamburg cohort , high expression of the fucosidase FUCA1 , the mannosidase MAN1A1 and the protein O - fucosyltransferase POFUT1 was associated with longer RFS , whereas the other genes correlated with a worse prognosis . Predictive value of glycosylation enzymes in chemotherapy - treated patients In order to analyze , if the glycosylation enzymes were also predictive for therapy response , we performed Cox regres - sion analyses in the subgroup of 100 patients who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy . Out of the 24 prog - nostic genes , eighteen also showed signiﬁcant associations Fig . 1 Representative Kaplan – Meier curves showing the prognostic value of twelve glycosylation enzymes in 194 patients from our Hamburg cohort ( see Table 1 ) . p Values after log - rank tests are given . Broken line lower expression of the gene of interest ; solid line higher expression Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2014 ) 145 : 295 – 305 299 123 with RFS and / or OAS in this subcohort ( Table 2 ) . For some genes , i . e . EXT1 , GCNT4 , FUCA1 , POFUT1 and EXTL3 , the association with outcome was even more pronounced compared to the total cohort , suggesting a speciﬁc role in chemoresistance . Stratiﬁed analysis of glycosylation enzymes in molecular subgroups of breast cancer We further investigated if the expression and prognostic value of these enzymes varied between different molecular subgroups . First , we performed Pearson correlations in order to investigate associations with oestrogen receptor ( ESR1 ) , progesterone receptor ( PGR1 ) and HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mRNA expression levels . High ESR1 levels clearly corre - lated ( correlation coefﬁcient q [ 0 . 4 or \ - 0 . 4 ) with low expression of the carbohydrate sulfotransferases CHST3 , CHST6 and CHST11 , and with high expression of the phosphatidyl GlcNAc transferase subunits PIGG , PIGH and PIGT . In addition , a positive correlation with the GalNAc transferase GALNT7 was found , which controls the initial step of O - glycosylation ( Table 3 ) . Using the same criteria for PGR1 , only one correlation ( q \ - 0 . 4 and [ 0 . 4 ) with the fucosyl transferase FUT3 was found , whereas ERBB2 expression did not correlate with the analyzed glycosylation genes . When ER - positive and ER - negative carcinomas were compared for expression of the analyzed glycosylation genes by t - test , 61 genes showed a positive association and 28 genes exhibited an inverse correlation with ER status as determined by immunohistochemistry ( Supplementary Table S4 ) .

In a stratiﬁed Cox regres - sion analysis , we found striking differences regarding the correlations with RFS . Whereas four enzymes of the N - glycosylation pathway ( RPN1 , DPM1 , MAN1A1 and GCS1 ) as well as POFUT1 and CHST3 were highly prognostic in luminal tumours only , three genes mainly involved in metabolism of O - glycans and glycolipids ( FUCA1 , GCNT1 and ST3GAL6 ) and the hyaluronidase HYAL1 turned out to be exclusively prognostic in triple - negative tumours ( Table 2 ) . In HER2 - positive cases , only the sulfatase GNS and the enzymes B3GNT4 and UGCG which are mainly involved in glycolipid synthesis were associated with RFS . Correlations with distant metastasis Several oligosaccharide structures play a role as ligands for selectins which represent important adhesion proteins of the endothelial cell layers , and thus facilitate extravasation of circulating tumour cells at the site of future metastasis . These selectin ligands are generally formed by O - glyco - sylation ( i . e . sialyl Lewis X and sialyl Lewis A ) , but can also be attached to glycolipids , N - glycans or GAGs . Therefore , we analyzed if the expression of the 24 prog - nostic genes correlated with distant metastases in general or metastasis to speciﬁc organ sites in the Hamburg cohort ( Table 4 ) . By v 2 tests using the quartiles ( see above ) , eleven genes were signiﬁcantly associated with distant metastasis , three additional genes showed a non - signiﬁcant association ( p = between 0 . 050 and 0 . 100 ) . Regarding the sites of dis - tant metastases , there were striking differences : cancers with relapse to bone were characterized by signiﬁcantly higher GCNT4 and B3GNT4 and lower XYLT2 expression levels as compared to carcinomas metastasising to other sites ( Table 4 ; Fig . 2 ) . In contrast , tumours with lung metastases showed lower FUCA1 and UGCG expression and higher GANAB , CSGALNACT2 and B3GNT4 levels compared to the rest . Interestingly , tumours metastasizing to the brain showed signiﬁcantly more hyaluronan synthase ( HAS2 ) , but also hyaluronidase ( HYAL1 ) expression indicating an active hyaluronan metabolism in these cases . Signiﬁcant associa - tions are shown in Table 4 and representative correlations in Fig . 2 . Discussion In the last years , an increasing interest in the biological role of glycosylation in general and especially in malignant progression of human cancer has developed . Most studies focused on the role of O - glycosylation and the formation of selectin ligands , due to the essential role of selectin binding in hematogenic metastasis [ 4 , 16 ] . Although these studies suggested an impact of glycosylation on tumour growth and progression , the knowledge about the prognostic and / or predictive role of glycan structures in human carcinomas is still limited . This is mainly due to technical problems which hamper a sensitive and speciﬁc analysis of sugar residues in cancer tissues . The analysis of expression levels of glycosylation enzymes might be a suitable indirect approach to at least partially overcome these limitations . A recent study analyzed the mRNA expression of 419 genes involved in synthesis , degradation , modiﬁcation and binding of glycans in breast cancer samples and breast tissue from healthy women [ 29 ] without reporting on the outcome of patients . The authors found a large number of genes which were deregulated in cancer specimens , which were involved not only in O - glycosylation , but also in the metabolism of N - glycans , GAGs and glycolipids . In our investigation , we concentrated on the prognostic or predictive effect of glycan genes and their possible involvement in metastatic spread . Among the genes with independent prognostic signiﬁcance , we found genes from all important glycosylation pathways , which is similar to prior results concerning genes with deregulated expression in breast cancer [ 29 ] . Due to technical reasons , it cannot be ruled out that the detected RNA partly originated from stromal cells . Yet , cellular models have previously shown the relevance of glycosylation enzymes in epithelial cancer cells themselves [ 7 ] , and it is commonly acknowledged that the interaction between tumour and stroma in vivo is of relevance . Among the 202 glycosylation genes included in our analysis , 64 ( 32 % ) showed a signiﬁcant prognostic impact in univariate Cox regression , and 24 thereof ( 12 % ) retained prognostic signiﬁcance in multivariate analysis . This high percentage of prognostic genes underlines the Table 3 Correlations of glycosylation enzymes with ESR1 and PGR mRNA expression Affymetrix no . q = ( Pearson test ) ESR1 ( 205225 _ at ) CHST3 32094 _ at - 0 . 449 CHST3 209834 _ at - 0 . 460 CHST6 221059 _ s _ at - 0 . 463 CHST11 219634 _ at - 0 . 535 PIGG 218652 _ s _ at 0 . 458 PIGH 209625 _ at 0 . 412 PIGT 217770 _ at 0 . 571 GALNT7 218313 _ s _ at 0 . 513 PGR ( 208305 _ at ) FUT3 214088 _ s _ at 0 . 470 Only correlations with q = \ - 0 . 40 or [ 0 . 40 after Pearson correla - tion were shown Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2014 ) 145 : 295 – 305 301 123 important role of glycosylation processes in tumour pro - gression . The list of 24 prognostic genes in the ﬁrst cohort included not only enzymes of glycan synthesis , but also catabolic genes involved in glycan trimming and degra - dation . For example , high expression of the fu - cosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT6 is associated with poor prognosis , whereas overexpression of the fucosidase FUCA1 correlated with relatively good outcome . Several , but not all of the 24 prognostic genes have been implicated in tumour progression in varying experi - mental settings : FUT1 and FUT6 are involved in the synthesis of Lewis antigens which are important ligands for selectins [ 21 ] . In several cancer entities , these enzymes were shown to increase resistance to apoptosis [ 11 ] , adhesion [ 17 ] , tumour growth [ 12 ] and metastasis [ 16 ] . The fucosidase FUCA1 cleaves off fucose residues , thus degrading Lewis antigens . In experimental systems , it reduces the invasive potential of breast cancer cells and their adhesion to selectins and endothelial cells under ﬂow conditions [ 39 , 40 ] . GCNT1 ( C2GNT1 ) and GCNT4 ( C2GNT3 ) are glu - cosaminyl ( N - acetyl ) transferases involved in formation of core 2 structures which serve as carriers of Lewis antigens . In bladder cancer cells , these branched glycans have an inﬂuence on immune evasion and metastasis [ 35 ] . Addi - tionally , GCNT1 promotes aggressiveness of germ cell tumours [ 13 ] . In leukaemia and oral squamous carcinoma cells , GCNT1 contributes to synthesis of selectin ligands [ 19 , 30 ] . This is also true for the sialyl transferase ST3GAL6 which is of prognostic relevance in our cohort . Similar to other sialyl transferases , ST3GAL6 has been shown to promote migration and metastasis of various cancer cells [ 6 , 28 ] . In addition to enzymes related to the formation of selectin ligands , we found an independent prognostic value of key enzymes of N - glycosylation . This was most prom - inent in luminal ( hormone - receptor positive ) carcinomas , whereas the former genes were more important in triple - negative tumours . N - glycosylation is important for various signalling processes and inﬂuences cancer progression in complex ways [ 20 ] . DPM1 synthesizes the mannose donor molecule , dolichol - phosphat mannose ( Dol - P - Man ) . Ribo - phorin ( RPN1 ) , as part of the oligosaccharidyltransferase ( OST ) complex , catalyzes transfer of a mannose - containing oligosaccharide from the dolichol carrier to nascent poly - peptides , and mannosidase ( MAN1A1 ) , glucosidase alpha ( GANAB ) and glucosidase 1 ( GCS1 ) are involved in trimming and maturation of N - linked oligosaccharides . Interestingly , GCS1 and GANAB turned out as unfavour - able prognostic indicators in breast cancer , whereas high MAN1A1 expression was associated with a better prog - nosis . The reason underlying this effect remains to be Table 4 Correlations of glycosylation enzymes with metastasis to different organs ( p values ) Gene symbol a Affymetrixno .

In vitro , mannosidase treatment of MCF7 breast cancer cells inhibited the formation of multicellular foci [ 2 ] . Interestingly , several enzymes involved in the formation of proteoglycans were also relevant in the Hamburg cohort . Strikingly , high expressions of the hyaluronan synthase HAS2 and the hyaluronidase HYAL1 were both associated with poor prognosis and metastasis to the brain . Hyaluro - nan is an independent prognostic indicator in breast cancer [ 3 ] , and inhibition of HAS2 blocks metastases in animal models [ 37 ] . For HYAL1 , both tumour suppressor and oncogenic activities were reported [ 10 , 34 ] . In our study , a signiﬁcant association of HYAL1 expression with early recurrence was only observed in triple - negative carcinomas which points to molecular - subtype speciﬁc differences . Another enzyme involved in the metabolism of proteo - glycans is CHST3 which catalyzes sulfation of chondroitin , resulting in the formation of selectin ligands [ 9 ] . In con - trast , the sulfatase GNS which leads to breakdown of heparan and keratan sulphate is associated with a good prognosis in our cohort . An unexpected result of our investigation is the associ - ation of high POFUT1 expression with a good prognosis in both cohorts . POFUT1 attaches fucose through an O - gly - cosidic linkage to conserved serine or threonine residues in EGF domains . This fucosylation has been reported to play a crucial role in Notch signalling [ 21 ] , which has been implicated in cancer metastasis [ 14 ] . Yet , EGF domains are also found in other proteins , and the role of O - fucosylation in these cases is poorly understood . How POFUT1 and some other genes ( UGCG , NAGA , GANAB , EXTL2 , etc . ) affect the malignant behaviour of breast cancer cells should be further analyzed in experimental models . Compared to our results within the ﬁrst ( Hamburg ) cohort , not all of the 24 glycosylation enzymes of interest were also prognostic in the Mainz cohort . This might result from discrepancies in patients’ characteristics , since all tumours from the latter cohort were node - negative , mostly of early stage and not treated with adjuvant therapy . In contrast , the Hamburg cohort included chemotherapy - treated tumours , and some of the observed associations might be also explained by a predictive role of the exam - ined enzymes and a role of these in therapy response . A strength of our study is the information about the anatomical sites of metastasis and the availability of a cohort of untreated patients that allows to examine the Fig . 2 Signiﬁcant associations of selected glycosylation genes with the localization of metastasis ( see Table 4 ) . p values after v 2 tests are given . Cases were divided into four groups of equal size ( quartiles Q1 – Q4 ) depending on expression values of the respective gene , and correlated with the presence of metastasis at speciﬁc sites . Y - axis number of tumours Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2014 ) 145 : 295 – 305 303 123 prognostic role of the enzymes . A drawback is the cohort size that does not allow to examine accurately all sub - groups of patients of potential clinical relevance and the effect of different systemic therapies in detail . In addition , only glycosylation genes which were represented on the HG - U133A microarrays were included in this study , and the prognostic signiﬁcance of various additional genes remains to be investigated . Nevertheless , the high number of 202 anabolic or catabolic genes ( 316 probesets ) which were analyzed in this study included most important enzymes of all glycosylation pathways . Taken together , we found that enzymes from all gly - cosylation pathways might play an independent prognostic role in breast cancer , with differences between molecular subtypes . This indicates an impact of those pathways on breast cancer progression and metastasis and thus might be interesting in search for suitable therapeutic targets . How changes in glycosylation enzymes inﬂuence the glycan structures and which protein or lipid structures are affected on the surfaces of cancer cells remains to be investigated .
