S . , University of Massachusetts Amherst M . S . , University of Massachusetts Boston Directed by Assistant Professor Tejaswini Dalvi Nanoscience and Nanotechnology ( NST ) is a booming multi - disciplinary field , with significant implications towards scientific and technological innovation . The growing reach of NST has created a demand for a skilled and scientifically literate workforce . However , NST is typically inaccessible outside of specialized contexts . Therefore , there is a need for bringing NST into the K - 12 classroom . In this study , we explored the use of technology - based NST modules to introduce middle and high school students to the field , wherein students unpacked an NST tool , the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , to learn about basic NST - related science concepts . The module created for this study was developed drawing from constructionist frameworks and iv the model of educational reconstruction ( MER ) . MER is a cyclical process that requires educators to consider existing scientific content structures , student knowledge and ideas about a topic , as well as teacher perspectives when designing a meaningful learning experience that attends to student and teacher needs . MER can also have positive impact on teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge ( PCK ) about a subject , bridging the gap between scientific content and facilitation . We have designed , revised , and implemented an NST module for grade 8 over the course of two years . Student survey responses , classroom videos , individual and group student work , and teacher interviews were analyzed for recurring themes and significant changes between module implementations . Our results suggested that the process of constructing and reconstructing an NST learning experience made for meaningful modules , with students demonstrating increased understanding of the AFM and increased interest in science , technology , engineering , mathematics ( STEM ) as a whole after engagement with the module content . Interviews with the collaborating teacher suggest that being involved in the module development process may have impacted her PCK about NST . Based on our results , we can use of a technological tool to introduce students to a novel discipline . We also suggest the use of MER for NST module development . v TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF TABLES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ix LIST OF FIGURES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . x CHAPTER Page 1 .

The modules were developed with the intent to introduce grade 8 and 9 students to the growing ﬁeld of nanoscience and nanotechnology ( NST ) . In particular , this study took an application - based , technology - rich approach , bringing an industry tool ( the atomic force microscope , or AFM ) to classrooms . The NST mod - ules that incorporate a constructionist ( Papert , 1980 ) approach , were developed using the Model of Educational Reconstruction ( MER ) ( Duit , Gropengiesser , Kattmann , Ko - morek , and Parchmann , 2012 ) . In learning experiences shaped by constructionist frame - works , based on constructivist frameworks , the belief is that knowledge is built upon , not acquired . Students learn by making , doing , collaborating and sharing their work ( Papert and Harel , 1991 ) . To capture the essence of the constructionist approach , we employed the MER framework . The MER is a framework for developing a learning experience and cyclically revising it to better attend to student ideas and the teacher’s perspective . The MER has been , for many topics in science , a powerful tool in gain - ing insights about student’s ideas , beliefs and misconceptions about scientiﬁc concepts ( Saarelainen and Hirvonen 2009 ; Felzmann , 2017 ; Niebert and Gropengiesser 2013 ) . This study aimed to study the evolution of student ideas and understanding about NST 1 concepts as a result of engagement with the module , and the effectiveness of teacher participation in the revision process towards preparing teachers to implement NST in their classrooms . My study was exploratory in nature , where I intended to gain insights towards planning and teaching NST at the late middle to early high school level . 1 . 2 Rationale Nanotechnology , a relatively new yet quickly booming industry , has impacted nearly ev - ery ﬁeld of science and has consequential societal implications ( Roco and Bainbridge , 2005 ) . The growing reach of nanotechnology has led to calls for NST education ini - tiatives and research ( Friedersdorf , 2020 ) . Despite this , NST remains largely inacces - sible to the K - 12 classroom . The tools , resources , and know - how are often limited to specialized research contexts , such as research universities . A signiﬁcant part of NST education research has focused on undergraduate students , who are more likely to have access to NST resources at their universities ( Furlan , 2009 ; Chopra and Reddy , 2012 ; Gottfried , 2011 ) . However , research has suggested that early exposure to NST may positively impact students’ interest in NST - related STEM careers ( Friedersdorf , 2020 ) . As nanotechnology is expected to grow , so is the demand for scientiﬁcally informed citizens and a technologically skilled workforce . The study presented here responds to the suggestions made to bring NST concepts and ideas to K - 12 classrooms , utilizing an application - based approach . With this constructionism - inspired approach , students are introduced to a discipline by ﬁrst exploring its’ applications through a technological tool . As students reverse engineer a tool , they learn about the underlying concepts that contribute to its’ functions and resulting effects of its use . The presented study used the MER as a framework for the development of the mod - ules . There has been limited reported work on use of the MER in NST , leaving space 2 to study the effectiveness of the framework in an NST context ( Stavrou , et al . , 2015 ) . The MER framework is based on ﬁnding alignment between students’ learning needs and teachers’ planning and facilitation practices . The need to ﬁne tune the teaching and learning requirements consequently creates a need to understand gaps in teacher preparation . Use of MER allowed us to collaborate with classroom teachers both as co - developers as well as practitioners for the NST modules . The relevant concepts of NST , being a newly emerging ﬁeld , were unfamiliar to K - 12 teachers . Teachers need support not only in understanding the new concepts , but also in understanding ways to success - fully integrate NST concepts in their classrooms . Studies that focus on teachers’ prepa - ration and training around NST call for providing teachers with relevant professional de - velopment in introducing NST concepts in their classrooms ( Huffman , Ristvey , Tweed Palmer , 2015 ) . In response , this study aims to consider the teacher perspective , through collaboration with classroom teachers towards developing innovative NST modules and further reﬂect on how the research - practitioner model supports teacher development . 1 . 3 Research Questions The study I present responds to the demand for exposure to NST in K - 12 classrooms , particularly in middle school where reported work is limited . To do so , we employ the MER , a powerful framework for informing science education , that has not been used extensively in NST , to design , evaluate , and revise a constructionist learning experience . Insights towards student readiness and interest in studying NST are noted during the revision process . This study is part of a larger effort to make nanotechnology more accessible to grades 8 and 9 by creating application - based modules where students are exposed to industry tools and technology to explore new NST concepts . In this thesis , I will attempt to answer the following research questions : 3 1 . How did students engage with technology - and application - based modules for teaching NST to grades 8 and 9 ? 2 . What are the affordances of using this format to teach novel science concepts ? 3 . How was the MER useful in preparing a teacher to teach an NST module , and developing her pedagogical content knowledge ? 1 . 4 Theoretical Frameworks In this section , the theoretical frameworks we drew from to design , facilitate , evaluate , and revise the module are discussed . The module draws from Constructionist theories of learning to inform the learning objectives and activities chosen during the module . It also draws from Model of Educational Reconstruction ( MER ) , a cyclical process used to create , test , and evaluate a learning experience by taking into account students’ en - gagement and beliefs about a topic before , during , and after the module . In combining these frameworks , we can design a hands - on , technology - based learning experience that suits student and teacher needs by evaluating and revising the module . 1 . 4 . 1 Constructivism , Constructionism , and Technology Constructivist theories of learning propose that knowledge is not acquired or given but built upon previously held knowledge ( Ackermann , 2001 ) . Constructivism holds that learning is an active process where communication and collaboration between peers , in a student - centered environment plays a signiﬁcant role in facilitating learning ( An - derson and Kanuka , 1999 ) . Constructivism calls for creating learning environments where students are given opportunity to build upon previously held beliefs or ideas dur - ing the learning experience . Constructionism , inspired by constructivism , still proposes 4 that knowledge is built upon itself . However , it calls for the learning experience to be centered around “making” or “doing’” ( Papert and Harel , 1991 ) . In construction - ist learning environments , students build something tangible that they can then share with other students , such as a model created during a design task . Working with phys - ical artifacts to engage learners in a particular discipline is the core of constructionism ( Papert , 1980 ) . Social interaction , similarly to constructivism , is an essential aspect of constructionism . As students work with their peers , they can verbalize their own think - ing and process their thoughts out loud , listen to others’ line of thinking , and learn from each other through immediate feedback ( Kafai and Harel , 1991 ) . When students work together , they are able to develop their content knowledge as well as strengthen their collaborative skills . The teachers’ role in constructionist learning environments is being a facilitator of the collaborative process between students while ensuring that they meet the set learning objectives ( Harel and Papert , 1991 ) . Research focused on teaching scientiﬁc concepts through learning environments that emphasize the use of a physical artifact , such as a technological tool , and social inter - action has demonstrated positive outcomes and implications . Jones et al . , ( 2003 ) found that high school biology students’ content knowledge had improved and attitude towards the subject were positively impacted after participating in a study of viruses by remotely operating an AFM with haptic feedback , versus those who did not experience haptic feedback during operation , suggesting touch plays an important role in exploring a sci - entiﬁc concept . Alimisis and Kynigos ( 2009 ) suggest that physically controlling robots is just as critical to understanding their build and behaviors as building and program - ming them , upon exploring a constructionist approach to robotics . Korwin and Jones ( 1990 ) explored and compared learning experiences about geodesic domes for eighth grade students , having one class engaged in building physical models with pipe cleaners and other materials , while the other included only reading and lecture about geodesic 5 domes and their geometry . After comparing test scores , Korwin and Jones reported sig - niﬁcant increase in students’ knowledge about geodesic domes as a result of engagement in hands - on , technology - based activities as compared with lecture - based learning . Lati and colleagues ( 2019 ) found that a series of hands - on labs exploring silica aerogel to discover nanoscience concepts positively promote high school student interest in NST . This study drew from the constructionist approach as we emphasized student en - gagement in a hands - on , collaborative , technology - based experience to unpack NST concepts . The module engaged students in exploring the AFM , a piece of technology used in nanoscience , as they engage in reading , discussing , observing demonstrations and modeling tasks working with their classmates . As students worked with a tangi - ble object and collaborate with their peers during these multi - modal experiences , they discovered and built their knowledge of NST concepts through studying the AFM as an NST tool . During the multiple experiences surrounding the AFM , students worked together , shaping their beliefs through immediate feedback from their peers in real time , meeting the social component of a constructionist approach . In turn , we believe pro - viding multiple opportunities allows for active engagement in learning that is crucial to support a constructionism - inspired learning experience . 1 . 4 . 2 The Model of Educational Reconstruction The MER is a framework created to improve the development of science learning ex - periences by attending to the relevant scientiﬁc content , as well as students’ ideas , and teacher perspectives surrounding that content ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . It is a cyclical process that entails clariﬁcation of the content , taking into account student and teacher needs , and developing and further revising planned learning experiences . The presented study drew from the MER framework by applying the cyclical revision process to the created 6 module , and by attending to student ideas and the teacher perspective . The MER is discussed in detail in Chapter 3 . 7 CHAPTER 2 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION 2 . 1 Deﬁning Nanoscience and Nanotechnology The preﬁx “nano - ” generally means one billionth ( 1 x 10 - 9 ) of a unit , typically relating to size ( i . e . “nanometer” implies one billionth of a meter ) ( Poole Jr and Owens , 2003 ) . Accordingly , the term “nanoscience” refers to the study of objects , their properties , and their behaviors at the nanoscale ( Bayda , Adeel , Tuccinardi , Cordani , Rizzolio 2019 ) . Insights on nanoscale entities and their properties lend themselves to nanotechnology , a highly multidisciplinary ﬁeld that draws from applied sciences and technology . Nan - otechnology , speciﬁcally , is the design , characterization , production , and application of structures , devices , and systems , by controlled manipulation of size and shape at the nanometer scale , typically resulting in at least one novel characteristic property ( Bawa , Bawa , Maebius , Flynn and Wei , 2005 ) . At these scales , materials may exhibit a range of unusual chemical and physical properties that may differ in important ways from the properties of bulk materials ( also known as “size - dependent properties” ) . For ex - ample , gold nanoparticles reﬂect red light in particular lighting conditions , a behavior that does not occur at a macro - scale ( Bayda , et al . , 2019 ) . Materials that are comprised of nanostructures exhibit interesting mechanical properties as well . Metals made up of particles with particle size of around ten nanometers are much harder , and therefore 8 more resilient , than typical metals having a particle size of around a hundred nanome - ters ( Berger , 2016 ) . Novel material properties , such as interesting size dependent phe - nomena and differing mechanical properties , have had a striking impact on technology . Nanotechnology has improved existing industrial processes , materials , and applications by scaling them down in order to ultimately fully exploit the unique quantum and sur - face phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale . The study of these properties has led to advances in nearly every scientiﬁc ﬁeld ( Roco and Bainbridge , 2005 ) . 2 . 2 Signiﬁcance of NST Following the Nobel prize winning invention of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope ( STM ) in 1981 , and its ability to image and manipulate individual atoms , nanotech - nology has vastly expanded as a ﬁeld ( Bayda , et al . , 2019 ; Rugar and Hansma 1990 ) . In response to the ﬁeld’s growing importance , the National Nanotechnology Initiative ( NNI ) was proposed in 2000 aiming to advance research , development , and commer - cialization of nanotechnology , push for education and scientiﬁc literacy , and support responsible use ( Sargent Jr . , 2010 ; National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine , 2020 ) . Since the creation of the NNI and similar initiatives , nanotechnology has quickly entered the mainstream through the components making up our everyday devices such as televisions , laptops , and smart phones . Through the exploration of nanotechnology in computing , the ceiling of innovation has been raised , leading advancement in quantum computing and ultra - small devices ( Wu , Shen , Reinhardt , Szu , and Dong , 2013 ) . Con - currently , nanotechnology has made an outstanding impact in medicine , particularly in cancer research towards therapies . Particularly , nanoparticles , quantum dots , carbon nanotubes , and other forms of nanotool have made signiﬁcant contributions to the ﬁeld 9 of cancer treatment . For example , multifunctional nanoparticles loaded with therapeu - tic drugs and imaging agents , and lined with biological response modiﬁers , are used to locate and image cancerous tissue , while providing treatment at the same time ( Misra , Acharya , and Sahoo 2010 ) . Use of nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery allows for highly precise , yet relatively non - invasive cancer treatment ( Yih and Al - Fandi , 2006 ) . The atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , invented as a follow up to the STM , is now a commonplace nanotechnological tool . A particularly exciting capability of the AFM is its ability to image at atomic resolution , having created detailed renderings of the topol - ogy of surface atoms soon after its invention , contributing greatly to materials science ( Rugar and Hansma , 1990 ) . The AFM also has the unique feature of being able to oper - ate using a submerged sample , which has seen success in the investigation of mechan - ical properties of breast cancer cells ( Ansardamavandi , Tafazzoli - Shadpour , Omidvar , and Jahanzad , 2016 ) . Nanotechnology has been explored and used in earth and climate sciences as well . For example , the study of nano - mineral properties for global heating and cooling , carbon - based nanoﬁlms and their potential for electric conductivity , and nanoprecipitation within soil that may have implications towards toxin distribution have all greatly inﬂuenced the earth science ﬁeld ( Hochella , 2002 ) . Responding to calls for eco - conscious practices , nanotechnology has been a driver towards revolutionizing agriculture to be more sus - tainable while being equally as productive through the use of engineered nanomaterials for improving crop growth ( Lowry , Avellan and Gilbertson , 2019 ) . In the search for en - vironmentally friendly advanced energy systems , nanotechnology has also contributed to solar and fuel development ( Zach , Hagglund , Chakarov , and Kasemo 2006 ) . Nan - otechnology , though useful in electronics , medicine , environmental sciences and life sciences , is not strictly limited to these ﬁelds . Research in NST is expected to lead tech - nological innovation and result in positive effects on the global economy by introducing 10 less expensive research methods while simultaneously widening job prospects ( Roco and Bainbridge , 2005 ) . Given the growing societal importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology , there is an established need for equipping the new generation of workforce with the scientiﬁc and technological knowhow of NST as well as generally scientiﬁcally informed and literate citizens ( Friedersdorf , 2020 ) . 2 . 3 NST in Education NST’s rapid expansion as a multidisciplinary ﬁeld has resulted in a continuous demand for skilled new generations of scientists , technicians , and engineers ( Friedersdorf , 2020 ) . In response , there is a call for NST - related content and experiences to be integrated into K - 12 curriculums to introduce students to NST concepts and applications before en - tering higher education realms ( Jones , Andre , Superﬁne , and Taylor , 2003 ; K ¨ ahk ¨ onen , Laherto , Lindell , and Tala , 2016 ) . The demand has consequently prompted science educators and researchers to study frameworks for teaching NST , concepts to empha - size , and teacher professional development practices surrounding this content . However , NST , being a relatively newly emerging ﬁeld , can be difﬁcult to implement as an early learning experience ( Blonder and Sakhnini , 2017 ; Friedersdorf , 2020 ) . NST is often inaccessible to K - 12 students and unfamiliar to K - 12 teachers , due to its’ specialized , technological nature ( Furlan , 2009 ) . Most reported work focused on NST interventions is concentrated in undergraduate levels and upper high school grades ( Stavrou et al . , 2015 ; Blonder and Sakhini , 2017 ) . Yet , there are reports that state the need for early interventions for their potential to positively impact students’ interest in STEM ﬁelds and careers ( Stevens , Sutherland Krajcik , 2009 ; Greenberg , 2009 ) . 11 2 . 3 . 1 NST concepts in the classroom As a starting point , Stevens , Sutherland and Krajcik ( 2009 ) suggested a set of central ideas as a framework to draw from when introducing NST to grades 7 - 12 : Size and Scale ; Structure and Matter ; Forces and Interactions ; Quantum Effects ; Size - Dependent Properties ; Self - Assembly ; Tools and Instruments ; Models and Simulations ; Science , Technology and Society . The identiﬁcation and use of key NST ideas create a founda - tion for students to build upon their knowledge , and for teachers to easily revisit concepts and investigate student progress . The nine big ideas are meant to cover both fundamen - tal scientiﬁc concepts as well as their applications , allowing students to develop skills necessary to move forward in NST ( Stevens , et al . , 2009 ) . Many of the ideas overlap with Next Generation Science Standards crosscutting concepts , such as Scale , Propor - tion , and Quantity ; Systems and System Models ; and Structure and Function ( NGSS , 2013 ) . Similarly , Blonder and Sakhnini ( 2017 ) suggested insertion points within ex - isting high school science curriculums where learning experiences encompassing NST ideas may ﬁt in . For example , lessons on atomic structure in chemistry may be a place to incorporate the previously suggested big ideas of size dependent properties or size and scale . By naming points where NST can ﬁt into existing curriculums , Blonder and Sakhnini highlight the interdisciplinary nature of NST . 2 . 3 . 2 Teaching of NST concepts Though there are concrete suggestions for introducing NST to K - 12 classrooms , imple - mentations of NST range in their teaching methods and content focuses . A common theme between NST education studies for grades 7 - 12 is a hands - on approach , drawing on constructivist theories of learning . Many also make use of the AFM , often model - ing or simulating its’ working principles . However , most experiences highlight use of 12 simulations and do not typically use the tool in real life . Pelleg and colleagues ( 2011 ) implemented a nanotechnology unit , in an elective introductory engineering class for all grades , at a science and engineering high school , focusing on size and scale , size dependent properties , and nanoscale characterization with a mix of lectures , short labs that modelled phenomena and tools , and ﬁnally allowed students to observe nanopar - ticles interact with DNA nucleotide bases . The unit was evaluated for its effectiveness through a word association survey , concluding that students were more likely to asso - ciate nanotechnology terms to science and engineering rather than media and consumer products after the unit . Stavrou , et . al . , ( 2015 ) found that students gradually accepted that property changes are possible due to changes in size through engagement in a sim - ilar series of nano - lab activities . Jones et al . , ( 2003 ) had grade 9 through 11 biology students remotely operate an AFM with a haptic interface , utilizing touch in an other - wise invisible context . This experience resulted in improved understanding about scale and dimensionality . Blonder and Sakhnini ( 2012 ) , tried a variety of teaching methods to introduce size and scale and surface - area - to - volume ratio , a size - dependent property , in - cluding playing games , storytelling , multimedia , project - based learning , and modeling . Lati , et al . , ( 2019 ) investigated student motivation to further study NST after activities exploring properties of a nanomaterial , silica aerogel . Even nanotechnology through the arts has been surveyed , by creating a set of activities that connect stained glass to the size - dependent properties of gold and silver nanoparticles ( Duncan , et al . , 2010 ) . Drawing from these empirical studies and the theoretical frameworks , the modules cre - ated as a part this study used a hands - on approach . However , one key difference is the way we brought and used an AFM , as well as a functional LEGO model , in the class - room , giving middle school students physical access to explore NST concepts through a nanotechnological tool they would otherwise not have access to . The LEGO AFM , in particular , contains the basic working components of the AFM for students to see , as a 13 real AFM’s components are hidden from view , and much smaller than the model . This technology - and application - based approach is meant to introduce students to the basic , big ideas of NST starting from a use of nanotechnology , drawing from the construction - ist framework . This study is mainly focused on the use of the Model of Educational Reconstruction ( MER ) as a theoretical framework , which has not particularly been uti - lized in the context of application based NST learning . 2 . 3 . 3 NST and Teacher Preparation Nanotechnology being as new as it is , and having the societal signiﬁcance it does , im - plies a need for teachers to be comfortable integrating NST concepts in their classrooms . As NST continues to grow as a ﬁeld , experiences cannot be limited to scientists visiting schools with expert NST knowledge ; teachers being well prepared to teach NST can maintain a comfortable ﬂow of learning . However , because of the novelty of NST , ways to prepare teachers to include NST in their curriculums are still actively being studied . Shulman ( 1987 ) coined the idea of “pedagogical content knowledge” or PCK , where content knowledge about a topic and the pedagogy surrounding it intersect , making for a more effective learning experience for the students . Studies that attend to teachers in NST education suggest that building teachers’ PCK about NST is going to be critical to successfully implementing NST concepts ( Huffman , et al . , 2015 ; Stavrou , et al . , 2018 ) . Blonder ( 2010 ) found that exposure and practice with an AFM teaching model had a positive impact on teachers’ attitudes towards teaching NST and their content knowl - edge . Lee , Wu , Liu and Hsu ( 2006 ) , similarly found that teachers with little knowledge about NST had improved their content knowledge and interest in NST after participating in a professional development experience . The studies suggest that given time and sup - port , teachers can be well prepared to teach the novel NST concepts in their classrooms . 14 The instructor perspective plays a key role in using the MER as a framework to develop any learning experience for students ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . In using the MER , teachers actively consider their audience and their needs to meet after clarifying the science content to be taught . Our participating teachers , although novice to the speciﬁc NST ﬁeld , have considerable expertise in science teaching . As we bring the new content to the teachers , we account for their expertise in teaching , and understanding of student learning levels and needs at speciﬁc grade levels . Involving the teachers in the iterative MER process helps them align the pedagogy with the speciﬁc NST concepts . In doing so , the MER is meant to improve teachers’ PCK about a topic as a result . This study , by using MER as a framework , took into major consideration inputs from the collaborating teacher while designing and revising our modules . It also aims to share insights about the collaborating teacher’s perspective and attitude towards teaching NST after working on the modules . 15 CHAPTER 3 MODEL OF EDUCATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION 3 . 1 Overview The Model of Educational Reconstruction ( MER ) was originally introduced in 1996 , in - tending to bridge the gap between accepted scientiﬁc content and student understanding of the content ( Kattmann , Duit , Gropengiesser , Komorek , 1996 ) . The MER includes a cyclical process of constructing and reconstructing a particular scientiﬁc learning ex - perience , using both scientiﬁc literature and real - life contexts to create a meaningful learning environment . The iterative process results in thorough content development , while structuring its implementation in response to student ideas and misconceptions , meanwhile positively impacting teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge ( PCK ) . As a framework based in constructivism , MER was developed from a perspective that “as - sumes that there is no ‘true’ content structure of a particular content area” ( Kattmann , et al . , 1996 , p . 2 ) and therefore , no one science content structure is the “correct” structure when designing lessons . Because of this assumption , equal emphasis is placed on both student ideas about the content as well as the accepted content structures within the sci - entiﬁc community . The MER includes three interconnected components that inﬂuence each other : a ) a clariﬁcation of the scientiﬁc content to be taught , including analysis of the edu - cational signiﬁcance of the content , 16 b ) identifying students’ ideas and pre - requisite knowledge , and teachers’ perspectives on the subject , and attitudes towards the subject matter before instruction , and c ) the design and evaluation of learning environments , materials , resources , and ac - tivities in response to ﬁrst two elements . Continual evaluation of the lesson’s efﬁcacy and student perspectives plays a large role in revising the learning experience towards making it more effective for teachers and students ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . The following section discusses these overlapping components . Figure 1 : The three interconnected components of MER , as created by Duit and col - leagues . From The Model of Educational Reconstruction — A Framework for Improv - ing Teaching and Learning Science by Duit , et al . , 2012 , Science education research and practice in Europe , p . 21 . Copyright 2012 by Brill Sense . 17 3 . 2 Components of the Model of Educational Reconstruction 3 . 2 . 1 Component A : Clariﬁcation and analysis of scientiﬁc content The ﬁrst component of the MER serves as the starting point for the cyclical process of constructing and reconstructing a lesson . When attending to this component , the focus is on review of the science content to be taught ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . In doing so , both the accepted perceptions of a topic ( i . e . relevant literature ) and perceptions based on human experiences ( i . e . contexts relevant to the learner ) are considered . The main aim for this component is to ﬁnd the “elementary” features of the content so that they can be clearly implemented in a content structure for instruction ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . First , one would consider science content structures that are already common in the representations of the subject matter . This includes commonly used textbooks , well known research journals , and other publications by experts of the topic . If the topic has a signiﬁcant history in beliefs associated to it , a review of all previously held beliefs may be considered as well . For example , if one were planning to structure an astronomy lesson such as Earth’s orbit around the sun , one may want to include the historical development of beliefs surrounding this topic . The review would then include ideas such as the Earth - centric point of views held by Plato in 4th century BC ( Lawson , 2004 ) to the current , accepted understanding that the sun is the center of our solar system and the Earth orbits around it ( Koestler , 1989 ) . In completing such a review , one is exposed to former and presently existing representations of that topic and builds upon their own content knowledge of it . The second aspect of this component is to acknowledge the educational signiﬁcance of the topic . The goal of this is to tailor the content to the audience , establish a con - text for the lesson planning and ultimately aid in the transition from science literature to content for instruction . This process decides which content to prioritize . Much of 18 the literature on any given scientiﬁc topic is written for other scientists , researchers , and experts in that ﬁeld . Duit , et al . ( 2012 ) suggest that in reviewing the content , it is crucial to approach the literature from a science education perspective , and potentially include review of science education practices in the subject being examined . By considering both the content at hand and the pedagogical knowledge surrounding the topic , teach - ers can broaden their content speciﬁc pedagogical knowledge , introduced by Shulman ( 1987 ) . Figure 2 : The processes of science content clariﬁcation and educational signiﬁcance analysis , as created by Duit and colleagues . From The Model of Educational Recon - struction — A Framework for Improving Teaching and Learning Science by Duit , et al . , 2012 , Science education research and practice in Europe , p . 21 . Copyright 2012 by Brill Sense . 19 3 . 2 . 2 Component B : Identiﬁcation of student perspectives , analysis of teaching and learning Consideration of the audience and context lends itself to surveying student beliefs about the topic . Component B includes clariﬁcation of the science content and a consideration of the education aspect . To make scientiﬁc content easily accessible for K - 12 students , it is important to consider not only the scientiﬁc literature , or the pedagogical literature , but also students’ preconceptions , exiting knowledge , and attitudes based on their ev - eryday lives and experiences . Framing science content in a context that the students are familiar with can make the learning experience more interesting and accessible . The prior knowledge students have is also useful to shape lesson objectives . For example , middle school students do not necessarily have a full and scientiﬁcally accurate perspec - tive on physics concepts . However , students may have a set of preconceived notions about some concepts . Ideas around force , motion , energy being to take shape early , when students encounter these words even outside classroom in everyday environments . For example , one idea a student may have about the force of Earth’s gravity on objects is that weight increases as objects are lifted higher off the ground . An idea like this may come from lore about pennies thrown off the Empire State Building injuring pedestrians below , a tale many have heard casually . Though an object’s weight in Newtons is constant on Earth , this is not necessarily an argument to discredit , and instead is a preconception to consider when planning a lesson to better guide the student towards understanding the physics concepts behind weight and gravitational potential energy ( Driver , Guesne , Tiberghien , 1985 ) . Alongside student ideas about scientiﬁc concepts , perceptions students have towards themselves , and their attitudes towards the topic can serve as starting points in lesson planning . Student attitudes towards the subject may be a useful metric of engagement as 20 well . For this component , Duit and colleagues recommend qualitative analysis methods such as interviews or miniature lessons to directly survey the preconceptions students hold about the subject matter . 3 . 2 . 3 Component C : Design and evaluation of learning environment Finally , the MER’s third component is at the core of the framework . It focuses on the de - sign , implementation , and evaluation of the learning environment . After reviewing the science content literature , pedagogical literature and research , and accounting for stu - dents’ perspectives , a lesson or study directly inﬂuenced by the results of Components A and B is created . Then , the lesson or study would be implemented and evaluated throughout . During the continuous evaluation , the focus is still on Components A and B , examining how the scientiﬁc content is being presented in instruction and taking note of students’ ideas throughout , as well as considering their own self - beliefs or attitudes . During implementation , the aim is to identify student misconceptions and areas of difﬁ - culty , which can further help revise the learning experience . All of these aspects are to be given equal consideration when beginning the recursive process of the MER . Following evaluation of the lesson’s effectiveness , updated student ideas including areas students struggled , and the teaching experience , the lesson or study may be revised and reimplemented to make it stronger . Each component is inﬂuenced equally by the other two and vice versa . The MER is naturally a cyclic model , where each component builds upon itself in real time . The process of reviewing Components A and B , and revising the plans for the experience , is repeated until the learning experience is satisfactory , continuing to tailor to the students’ and teachers’ needs throughout . 21 3 . 3 Applications of the MER Framework The MER has been employed in designing and evaluating a wide range of science edu - cation topics in many grade levels , particularly undergraduate physics . For example , Saarelainen and Hirvonen ( 2009 ) proposed using the MER in planning electromag - netism lessons , speciﬁcally to create teaching sequences for electrostatics . Electro - magnetism is typically too abstract for students to understand quickly . Saarelainen and Hirvonen found that using the MER as a framework to teach concepts such as forces generated by an electric ﬁeld was effective in improving student understanding when comparing exam scores from before and after following the teaching sequence . Levrini ( 1999 ) described pathways to teach undergraduate modern physics based on clariﬁcation of content and educational signiﬁcance of spacetime . Taking into account both the sci - entiﬁc content and where students frequently struggle , Levrini’s research suggested the design of a lesson aiming to answer questions students may have along the way . Saare - lainen and Viiri ( 1999 ) provided insight on student understanding of optics through their study employing MER in university optics lessons . Their early study aimed to point out gaps in conceptual understanding of light and seeing , concluding that polarized light is a concept that students struggle with , suggesting a focus on this gap in the next iteration of the lesson . Studies of the MER in physics occur for the high school level as well . For example , Kersting , Henriksen , Bøe , and Angell ( 2018 ) used the MER to design and evaluate an advanced general relativity lesson for ﬁnal year high school students . The study used student interviews and written responses to shape the lesson as it continued . Kersting and colleagues found that when given appropriate time and scaffolds based on their learning needs and levels , the participating students showed improved understand - ing of underlying physics concepts . 22 The MER has shown to be useful in a wide range of science domains . For example , Reinfried and colleagues ( 2015 ) employed the MER for physical geography , with the aim to help middle school students to develop their conceptions about water springs and to understand counterintuitive aspects when comparing two different types of springs . Their ﬁndings demonstrated successful and stable gains in student understanding . Rein - fried and colleagues noted the short duration ( 90 minutes ) of their intervention , suggest - ing that the MER is effective over brief periods of time . This result suggests the MER can be useful for informing short module development . Similarly , Felzmann ( 2017 ) uti - lized the MER to examine early high school student ideas of glacier formation and ice ages . Results from the study suggested that the of MER helped identify areas of difﬁ - culty for students learning of the topic . Felzmann also suggested that the MER helped turn the complicated geoscience concepts into less complex , teachable , core ideas . The MER has also been used in the context of climate change . Niebert and Gropengiesser ( 2013 ) used the MER to develop a learning environment for late high school students wherein students preconceived notions of greenhouses gases and their effects on the planet are explored . Continuous evaluation of the designed learning environment re - sulted in being able to track the learning paths students took towards developing their understanding about climate change . The MER framework has informed the design of learning experiences in computer science ( Diethelm , Hubwieser , Klaus , 2012 ; Grillenberger , Przybylla , Romeike , 2016 ) , life sciences ( Riemeier Gropengiesser , 2008 ) , and electrical engineering ( Block , 2016 ) . Stavrou , et al . , ( 2015 ) utilized the MER in an NST context , developing a learning se - quence for eighth grade students , introducing the big idea of size and scale . Stavrou , Michailidi Sgouros , ( 2018 ) also studied teachers’ perspectives on teaching and learn - ing NST by using the MER themselves to create a teaching - learning - sequence . Among these studies , the MER has shown to be useful to enhance students’ learning of difﬁcult 23 or new concepts , due to its’ reﬂective and recursive nature . The emphasis on student ideas and teacher perspective makes for an experience that is more contextually relevant and meaningful . 3 . 4 Use of MER in this study Insights from the above listed empirical studies guided use of MER for this study . The MER was chosen for design , evaluation , and revision of the NST module , because the MER has shown to be successful in introducing students to typically difﬁcult or abstract concepts in the physical sciences . Therefore , the MER framework may be a good ﬁt for creating NST learning experiences for K - 12 . The MER also allows for tracking of student engagement and content understanding through participation in the revision pro - cess . In the study , the recursive process began with a clariﬁcation of the relevant science content via textbooks and other publications from experts in the ﬁeld ( Component 1 ) . This included review of accepted deﬁnitions relevant to NST and current advancements in the ﬁeld for a complete picture of the ﬁeld from a scientiﬁc perspective . Then , in order to review the content with a science education lens , an analysis on NST education literature was conducted . In doing so , content structures used to present NST to students can be studied to inﬂuence lesson planning . For the study , we intended on introducing students to NST concepts via the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . The AFM , a commonplace NST tool , can image sample sur - faces at the nanoscale . However , the details of the AFM’s working principles are beyond the typical scope of eighth grade physics understanding . The AFM works by sensing small Van der Waals forces between its’ tip that scans over the sample surface , and the sample ( Giessibl , 2003 ) . The tip either taps or hovers above the sample , and a laser / detection subsystem measures any changes in the tip height due to the interaction 24 forces . These forces are naturally - occurring between any two atoms , molecules , or sur - faces . We did not insist that students understand these forces , but we did focus on the sub - systems and their roles in producing an image . Regardless , the AFM is a ”black box” with its sub - systems being very small , and hidden from user view . Hence , we developed a LEGO AFM model ( Figure 4 ) , that includes the moving sub - systems : the cantilever / tip , and the laser / detector . The model enlarges the hidden inner working sys - tems of a real life AFM ( Figure 3 ) , making the image production process visible to the students . Figure 3 : The real - life AFM we used in demonstrations and as inspiration for the LEGO model . The AFM’s total dimensions are approximately 12 inches x 12 inches x 6 inches , with the actual microscope components being hidden from user view , and much smaller . Inputs from high school science teachers , such as concepts students were already familiar with and implementation of the science standards ( NGSS Lead States , 2013 ) , were considered to inform module design and instructional practices . These discussions also aided in identifying the teaching context . 25 By studying NST from an educational perspective and taking inputs from current science teachers , the audience’s point of view is considered ( Component 2 ) and the lesson can better attend to student needs . The content review and perspectives from teachers informed the development of a pilot nanotechnology module wherein students were introduced to nanoscience and nanotechnology through the AFM . Investigation of the results of the pilot module , including responses student reﬂections and attitude surveys , led to revisions towards improving the learning experience and implementing a reworked module ( Component 3 ) . The reworked module was then used to probe stu - dents’ readiness to explore NST , attitude towards learning the NST concepts , aspects that support understanding and conceptual difﬁculties they faced . Though only two rounds of implementation have occurred so far , as the MER is a continual cyclical pro - cess , the results from the revised module may now be used to revise again and continue the recursive process of the MER , strengthening the learning experience with each revi - sion . In the following chapter , I will discuss the use of MER to develop the module for this study in further detail . 26 CHAPTER 4 MODULE DEVELOPMENT In this chapter , I describe the ways in which MER was utilized during the study , and how we leveraged the interconnected components towards creating application - based , technology rich NST modules for grade 8 . 4 . 1 Participants The participants included teachers and students from two public school districts in Mas - sachusetts . The initial teacher discussions and introductory lesson were held at one of the school sites with 4 teachers and 45 students from grade 8 and 9 science courses . The pilot module was held at a middle school from a second school district with 77 stu - dents across four eighth grade general science classes , and with a collaborating science teacher . The revised module was held at the same school , where we continued to work with the same teacher , with 47 new eighth grade students . Data was collected and used from students who consented for the study . 4 . 2 Preliminary Sessions The MER calls for a clariﬁcation of the scientiﬁc content to be taught , as well as the context for the module ( Component A ) . Before planning the module , the research team 27 reviewed current NST literature and identiﬁed scientiﬁc content that would be appro - priate to be introduced in high school . Following this , an initial set of discussions with collaborating high school teachers were held to better identify appropriate cur - ricular alignment for introducing NST concepts at the early high school level . These discussions with different school faculties from physics , life sciences , chemistry , and engineering helped us ﬁnd curricular alignment ( relevant standards ) as well as grade - appropriate context for introducing the content . Teacher inputs were crucial to best structure the lessons and decide upon facilitation techniques , and in doing so , listening to their perspectives attended to the second component of MER ( Component B ) . Dur - ing these discussions , an overview of NST concepts and the intended approach of using technology , speciﬁcally the AFM , to introduce the new NST concepts to students was presented to the teachers . The teachers then made suggestions for topics where NST could be introduced and alignment with the current science standards ( NGSS , 2013 ) . For example , the engineering teacher agreed with using the technology - based approach . The teacher saw value in introducing students to a new technology and its exploration , and also suggested an overlap between the NST content introduction and newly in - troduced engineering standards . The collaborating chemistry teacher identiﬁed places within the curriculum to introduce nanotools to help students apply chemistry content . There was an overall consensus that an NST module for early high school may have signiﬁcant impacts , despite the ﬁeld’s novelty . The application - based learning format was formalized out of the discussions , and a short , basic lesson was created , ﬁnally attending to Component C : design and evaluation of a learning experience . The intro - ductory lesson featured a functional LEGO model of the tool , AFM ( Figure 4 ) . The model included the physical LEGO component , demonstrating the movement of parts inside an AFM , and a computer interface that students watched create an image of the ‘sample’ surface on the LEGO component . A demonstration of the LEGO AFM fol - 28 lowed by a slideshow presentation deﬁning nanotechnology and introducing some of its applications was held for two grade 8 and one grade 9 class . The lesson was intended to gauge student engagement with NST concepts , that would help us understand their perceptions and readiness to engage in learning NST . The lesson was facilitated by the research team and conducted for 45 minutes . After the lesson , students were given a survey asking what appealed to them the most , with the response largely being about the LEGO aspect of the AFM model . In discussions following the introductory lesson , the teachers met with the researchers to share their inputs and to examine survey results . Teachers expressed excitement towards the LEGO AFM , suggesting it was an effective teaching tool . The teachers thought the LEGOs were relatable and familiar to students , making the scientiﬁc concepts more approachable and less mysterious . Therefore , a main input among the teachers was to keep the LEGO AFM . The teachers suggested building on the image analysis aspect of the AFM in further additions to the module , to help students to understand the application of AFM . This might include examining the phase shift graphs associated to the images , as students could apply their knowledge of analyzing plots and graphs . Standards and curricula were again reviewed , now having seen the module , to ﬁnd places where speciﬁc explorations using the AFM and its image analysis abilities could be used to introduce a topic within a discipline and connect back to nanotechnology . Notably , the chemistry teacher suggested using the LEGO AFM to study polymers , directly connecting to existing chemistry labs . These suggestions were carefully taken into consideration to create a complete pilot module . Design of the pilot module would then be the beginning of the next cycle of MER , as it drew from the re - sults of the introductory discussions and lesson , to evaluate the learning experience and strengthen it with the next iteration . The pilot module design and revisions based on its implementation are discussed in the following section . 29 Figure 4 : Side view of the LEGO AFM model and its components 4 . 3 Pilot Module The pilot module was designed with the aforementioned inputs in mind , with the help of the collaborating teachers from the introductory sessions . The module was taught mainly by the researchers with support from one new collaborating teacher and imple - mented across four new grade 8 classes . Reﬂection questions students were asked are discussed in the following chapter . The pilot module used the 5E model ( Bybee , et al . , 2006 ) as the lesson planning framework . The 5E model , in particular , was chosen for its’ constructivist approach ( Duran Duran , 2004 ) . 5E is a common framework used for emphasis on student engagement , where the ﬁrst step is to grab the students’ attention , and by the end evaluate what they have learned . The pilot module was designed to have two parts , introducing students to a common NST tool , the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . The ﬁrst part focused on the LEGO AFM . A researcher led a ten - minute pre - 30 Figure 5 : From left to right , three separate student models of the LEGO AFM from the pilot module . All student models included the main required components : the cantilever , the tip , the laser , and the sensor . sentation on the nanoscale and discussed the AFM as a necessary tool to observe at the nanoscale , before moving onto the ten minute LEGO AFM demonstration . After stu - dents watched the LEGO AFM run , they answered content probing questions about the LEGO AFM in groups of four , for about ﬁve minutes . Then , for ﬁfteen minutes , they created their own models of an AFM with materials such as cardboard , popsicle sticks , glue guns and pipe cleaners ( Figure 5 ) . Students were given few criteria , and were only required to include the four main components of the AFM : the cantilever , the tip , the laser , and the laser sensor . The modeling task was proposed by the collaborating teacher , 31 Figure 6 : Student drawn phase shift graph , noting hardness and softness of the material being modeled ( a bumpy clay surface ) . to explore the parts of an AFM in a hands - on way . At the end of the ﬁrst part , students individually completed an exit ticket asking if they found the LEGO AFM model useful in understanding how the AFM works . In the second part of the pilot module , a real AFM was brought into the classroom , and was used to study polymer structures at the nanoscale . Students were asked to consider why a clear plastic cup breaks less easily than a Styrofoam cup . Then , students were given a cup of each type and tasked with a “destruction test” to observe what happens when they try to break the cups , ﬁnding Styrofoam to be brittle and plastic to be ﬂexible . Next , the real AFM scanned and produced an image of the polymer that made up the plastic cup they had just tried to destroy . Students were asked to observe the image , and study a phase shift graph , denoting harder and softer spots in the sample . To further understand the phase shift graph , students worked together in groups to recreate a phase shift graph by graphing the scanning movement of one student’s ﬁnger over a bumpy surface ( Figures 6 , 7 ) . Finally , the image of the plastic cup polymer 32 Figure 7 : Student drawn phase shift graph , noting hardness and softness of the material being modeled ( a bumpy clay surface ) . This example also considers the height changes of the surface . was compared to an image of the Styrofoam , and the image analysis of differences between the cups answered the original investigation question . These activities were followed by a whole class discussion to unpack the connection between the imaging process explored during the ﬁrst part , and the resulting image and its analysis . Finally , students individually answered questions about the purpose of an AFM image as another exit ticket activity . Students were also given a modiﬁed version of the S - STEM survey ( The Friday Institute , 2012 ) before and after the module . The S - STEM Surveys 1 asked students to rate their interest in STEM subjects ( math , science , engineering / technology ) and eleven STEM career ﬁelds . STEM subject questions were statements such as , “math has been my worst subject , ” or “I am sure I could do good work in science . ” Students 1 Full details of development and validity of the S - STEM Surveys are available via The Friday Institute at the North Carolina State University . 33 respond on a scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) . Similarly , students read descriptions of career ﬁelds like physics , chemistry , medicine , etc . and rank how interested they are in the ﬁeld from 1 ( not at all interested ) to 5 ( very interested ) . Finally , students respond to yes or no questions about their interest in taking advanced STEM classes and whether they know anyone who works in STEM . All questions from the surveys can be found in Appendix A . As the MER is a cyclical process , and all components should be addressed through - out , design , implementation , and evaluation of the pilot module continually drew from the framework . Teacher perspectives on the content and the learning environment were considered in module design . The pilot module plan was inﬂuenced both by the teacher inputs from the introductory sessions as well as the collaborating science teacher , who gave suggestions for activities based on experiences with her classes . For example , she suggested a modeling task , having seen the beneﬁt of students exploring something unfamiliar through modeling before . Student ideas about the content , and their per - spectives towards NST were investigated during the module as well . Themes within responses from students’ individual reﬂections suggested that students needed more time breaking down the AFM as a tool before delving into image analysis . Students were sometimes able to identify certain sub - systems , but not how they worked together to produce an image . When asked how the AFM was useful in seeing the differences between two cups , many students described the images they saw without reasoning or connection to the imaging process . Therefore , a clear conclusion from the pilot module was that a thorough understanding of the imaging process is necessary to effectively perform image analysis . After evaluation , the pilot module was revised again to better support the students in understanding the imaging process of the AFM . 34 4 . 4 Revisions to Pilot Module Figure 8 : Student model of the LEGO AFM from the revised module The revised module only focused on the ﬁrst part of the pilot – the LEGO AFM ex - ploration – in response to evaluation of the pilot module . The intent of slowing down the module was to allow students the time and resources to investigate the AFM’s working mechanisms , its underlying physics principles , each of its subsystems , and how those subsystems contribute to the imaging process . Hence , the revised module also included multiple deliberate experiences with the AFM . The revised module included both the LEGO AFM demonstration and the modeling task from the pilot module . However , a reading task about the history of AFM was added to further give students context sur - rounding the AFM and its use . A demonstration in which students were shown a laser pointer and a mirror , one of which had a changing angle , was added as well , to break down the laser component of the AFM . Finally , students were given an exit ticket to reﬂect upon the usefulness of the LEGO AFM , the purpose of a real AFM , and how they would be connected . Students were also given the S - STEM surveys before and af - ter the revised module , though they now included a content questionnaire . The content 35 Figure 9 : Students test their AFM model by shining a laser on their cantilever’s reﬂective surface , to check for deﬂection towards sensors questionnaire included two multiple choice questions about the meaning of the preﬁx nano - and one open - ended question about the importance of nanotechnology . Imple - mentation of the revised module was also teacher - led rather than being researcher - led , as in the pilot module . Following the module , we held a short interview with the teacher to reﬂect on her preparedness to teach the module and introduce NST concepts into the classroom . Though the revised module was the last iteration of the MER cycle for this particu - lar learning experience , observations from the process of designing , implementing and evaluating the revised module can be used to further strengthen it if desired . Student ideas about the content were observed via classroom videos , and their responses to their exit tickets and content questionnaires . For example , it was difﬁcult to tell whether students realized the difference between imaging at the nanoscale and imaging a nano - sized object . This is a conception that could be further explored in another round of revision . This iteration of the module also had an emphasis on the teacher perspective . 36 The revised module was teacher led , allowing the teacher to experience ﬁrsthand the student response to NST and explore her readiness to teach NST concepts . The teacher was asked to reﬂect upon her experience at the end of the module as well . 37 CHAPTER 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this chapter , I present results from data collected during the modules and discuss what the results tell us about student engagement with technology - heavy , application - based NST modules for grade 8 . Throughout this study , our intent was to explore student ideas about NST based on their participation . Therefore , I review the evolution of student ideas over the course of module revisions . Then , I discuss the impact of participating in module development and implementation on the collaborating teachers’ preparedness to teach an NST module . Figure 10 demonstates a condensed version of the study structure , and how data sources align 5 . 1 Results 5 . 1 . 1 S - STEM Surveys One goal of the study was to investigate student attitudes towards STEM and interest in pursuing STEM in the future . To do this , students were given S - STEM surveys ( The Friday Institute , 2012 ) . Student responses to Likert - scale questions were assigned num - bers where 1 = Strongly Disagree , and 5 = Strongly Agree . The numerical data was then compiled to compare pre - and post - module ratings from all participating students , using paired t - test analysis ( Roberson , Shema , Mundfrom , Holmes , 1995 ) Frequency of answers were counted for the ﬁnal yes or no questions . Results of the S - STEM surveys 38 Figure 10 : Chart of obtained data sources , and how they combine to inform answers to our research questions . for both the pilot and the revised module are shared below . Note that the modules are too short in duration to infer any direct claims about the inﬂuence of the module on students’ attitudes . Still , evaluation of the student perspective remains a large part of the MER process , and therefore have been used to inform module development . The surveys also allow us to examine potential areas of interest the students have that NST could expose them to . The full S - STEM Surveys can be found in Appendix A . Pilot Module : Analysis of S - STEM surveys from the pilot module found no statisti - cally signiﬁcant change in pre - and post - attitudes towards STEM subjects , t ( 2 ) = 1 . 76 , p = 0 . 2 . though average attitude scores increased slightly for both science and engineer - ing / technology . Similarly , the surveys found no signiﬁcant change in interest towards STEM careers , t ( 10 ) = 0 . 96 , p = 0 . 3 . However , we saw increases in math , computer science , engineering , medical sciences and medicine , which are disciplines that are rel - 39 evant to NST . It is possible the pilot module had inﬂuence on the students’ interest in working with math , having done a phase shift graphing activity during the module . The surveys did not ﬁnd strong statistically signiﬁcant changes in number of students who have interest in taking advanced math , t ( 3 ) = 2 . 44 , p = 0 . 09 , and science courses , t ( 3 ) = 1 . 98 , p = 0 . 2 , in the future . However , both subjects demonstrated an increase in num - ber of students who said they would take advanced STEM courses , suggesting potential inﬂuence in their interest in pursuing advanced STEM topics after exposure to the NST module . While no direct claims were made from these results , these results informed us about students’ background and consequently , their perceptions surrounding STEM as they apply to NST . The results suggest that students may have been intrigued by the NST content , and it may have positive inﬂuence on STEM perceptions and attitudes if students were to continue with NST - related content . Revised module : Similarly , the S - STEM survey results did not demonstrate statisti - cally signiﬁcant changes in pre - and post - attitudes towards STEM subjects , t ( 2 ) = 1 . 35 , p = 0 . 3 , and interests in STEM careers , t ( 10 ) = 1 . 99 , p = 0 . 07 , and advanced math and science courses , t ( 3 ) = 3 . 0 , p = 0 . 06 . Nonetheless , surveys from the revised module showed an increase in all three subjects students rated ( math , science , and engineer - ing / technology ) . This was a positive change from the pilot modules , which had nearly stagnant results between pre - and post - attitude values . The surveys also showed in - creases in more STEM career ﬁelds than previously , with increases in nine out of eleven career ﬁelds , as compared to ﬁve out of eleven in the pilot module ( Table 1 ) . For example , in this round , we found that Earth Science shows a large positive in - crease . This increased interest may be due to some speciﬁc module related experiences . During the AFM module , students studied topographical images of the sample scanned using AFM . During a discussion on topography , and different types of studies that fo - cus on topography of surfaces , the teacher , used an explicit example of study of ocean 40 Career Field Post - Survey Scores , 2019 Post - Survey Scores , 2020 Change from 2019 to 2020 Physics 2 . 17 2 . 50 0 . 33 Environmental Science 2 . 06 2 . 24 0 . 18 Biology & Zoology 2 . 47 2 . 82 0 . 36 Veterinary Science 2 . 73 2 . 88 0 . 15 Math 2 . 77 2 . 34 - 0 . 43 Medicine 2 . 94 3 . 10 0 . 16 Earth Science 1 . 99 2 . 19 0 . 20 Computer Science 2 . 20 2 . 17 - 0 . 03 Medical Science 2 . 45 2 . 67 0 . 22 Chemistry 2 . 24 2 . 64 0 . 40 Engineering 2 . 82 2 . 67 - 0 . 15 Table 1 : Changes in student self - reported attitudes towards STEM career ﬁelds from 2019 to 2020 . Scores were collected from a Likert scale survey where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree . Attitude scores were averaged across all classes . ﬂoors . The use of this speciﬁc example may have had some inﬂuence of students think - ing about the use of AFM or reason for topographical studies . Some students referred to the scanned sample surface as the ‘ground’ , in their reﬂections . It is possible that in doing the post - surveys , students related with the teacher example of ocean surface and made a connection with Earth science ﬁeld . While we do not have direct evidence apart from student reﬂections , based on literature on the impact of teacher examples or metaphors in student thinking , we may argue for a potential inﬂuence of teacher explanation to student response . We also found increased interest in the career ﬁelds 41 of Veterinary and Medicine . This might be possible because of the multiple examples given around use of nanotechnology is detection of medical aliments , drug delivery and ﬁnding cures , especially for cancer . Results from surveys , although they did not show any statistically signiﬁcant changes , reﬂected positive increase in STEM attitudes amongst the students . We acknowledge that the sample sizes , particularly for the revised module , are small ( N ≤ 30 ) due to a number of students not ﬁlling out either the pre - or post - S - STEM survey . Because of the small sample size , variances in measurement can highly inﬂuence results ( Delice , 2010 ) . We note our sample size , and short duration of module implementations as lim - itations , discussed further in the concluding chapter . The positive changes in attitudes and interests towards STEM between the pilot and revised module may indicate a link between using MER to continuously revise a learning experience to improve it . MER aims to thoroughly take the learning context into consideration when planning a les - son . Because of this , students’ needs , and learning abilities may be better attended to when using MER to evaluate a lesson repeatedly . It is possible that if students are better engaged with NST content or enjoying the module’s experiences , they may ﬁnd them - selves more intrigued to pursue it further or feel conﬁdent about the topic . If that is the case , then giving extra support around students’ pre - existing ideas about NST may be useful in inﬂuencing student interest in NST careers in the future . As the demand for a skilled and scientiﬁcally literate workforce increases , engaging students with NST early may positively contribute to their awareness of NST and pique their interest to study it further . 5 . 1 . 2 Student Reﬂections Throughout both the pilot module and revised module , students were asked to respond to reﬂection questions either individually or as a group . Responses to these reﬂection 42 questions gave insight into students’ thinking about NST content , and how the module impacted their understanding of the relevant concepts . In this section , student reﬂection tasks and their results are discussed , in attempt to answer our ﬁrst two research ques - tions . All reﬂections were studied using a broad thematic analysis ( Braun and Clarke , 2012 ) , in which we looked for common threads between student responses , regardless of scientiﬁc accuracy . The methodology of applying thematic analysis is described fur - ther in this section . The content questionnaire and all reﬂection questions can be found in Appendices B and D . Pilot module : During class , students were asked to discuss and record answers to content probing questions in groups of four : 1 ) How does the AFM image the surface ? 2 ) To image something very small , how should the LEGO AFM be changed ? 3 ) What are some problems with the LEGO model ? We analyzed the frequency of different types of responses to each question . We were not insistent that responses necessarily be scientiﬁcally correct or use particular vocabulary . When asked about the imaging process , the majority of student responses focused on the general movement of the LEGO system . For example , “The AFM images the surface by going up and down . ” It is important to note that the AFM is a complex system where different subsystems work synchronously . For students observing these systems for the ﬁrst time , it might be difﬁcult to recognize all the subsystems . An equal number of re - sponses highlight the deﬂecting laser movements and the sensor system that captures the movements . However , such responses do not elaborate how these systems contribute to the image production . Although they did not provide any reasoning , we noted that some students started to notice the subsystems and their functions . Few responses focused on the cantilever movement , that is coupled with the platform movement , which helps scan the surface that is to be imaged . These responses recognized multiple subsystems . Although there was no explicit explanation of how the subsystems work together , stu - 43 dents recognized the different subsystems . The next question focused on the scale and asked for changes to the LEGO model to capture images at a nanoscale . The students had so far not seen a real AFM . Students mainly suggested scaling down the laser and sensor system , adding more sensors , and using stronger lasers . The next most frequent responses suggested reducing the AFM size but did not say how . A small number of responses suggested making a ﬁner scanning tip to capture smaller scale without elab - oration on how a ﬁner tip helps scan at a smaller scale . The overall response trends suggest that students were thinking of the function of each mechanical element of the AFM and the scale to achieve magniﬁcation . The ﬁnal question probed for potential problems with the LEGO system to see how students analyze technology with respect to its scale , purpose , and functionality . A majority of responses stated that the use of LEGOs makes the model AFM fragile . Some stated the cantilever tip scratching the surface being imaged can harm the object affecting the image quality . A few responses listed potential inaccuracies within the system , like displacement of the laser from its position due to movements of other system parts . These highlight students’ increas - ing awareness of the scale and stability problems associated with the use of LEGOs . They made attempts to analyze technology to see how well its ready to serve speciﬁc functions . At the end of the module , students individually responded to the question , “Did the AFM help you understand the differences in the physical properties of the two cups ? How ? ” The reﬂections were qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis ( Braun and Clarke , 2012 ) . First two researchers independently sorted the responses as they looked for over - arching themes , consolidating into one set for the nature of the responses , fo - cusing less on correctness or scientiﬁc accuracy . Sorting categories emerged out of the recurring themes . Next , responses from all the classrooms were de - identifying and ran - 44 domly mixed to create a master sheet for analysis . Three consecutive rating rounds by two other raters led to achieving an inter - rater reliability of 90 % . Most student responses only acknowledged the difference between the two cups without further reasoning . This may suggest that either the students failed to understand the question , do not attend to it completely , or the module has not helped them under - stand the function of AFM . For the next most frequent category , students described the image as they saw it , without elaborating on why or what it may mean , providing no analysis of the image . Although there is no evidence of students understanding of the related NST concepts , they were trying to achieve the next level in building scientiﬁc explanations going beyond rephrasing the questions . This may suggest that students still need support constructing and writing scientiﬁc explanations . The next most frequent categories had equal responses that describe the purpose of AFM , which may suggest that the students were able to grasp the idea of scale and use of technology to attain zoomed in images . Also , responses that described how the AFM helps image the samples may reﬂect students’ understanding of the purpose of AFM as a tool and its function . Responses that not only described the differences in the cups , but connected back to the imaging process , might have exhibited a deeper level of understanding where they attempt to use the image as evidence and provide reasoning for why the cups exhibit certain properties . These responses ranged in levels of understanding either the question , the working properties of the AFM , or construction of scientiﬁc explanations . Our study design did not allow us to make any direct claims about the gains of the intervention at this stage . However , a small but deﬁnite number of reﬂections may suggest that students are ready to explore NST concepts and ideas that are beyond the prescribed scope of beginning high school study . These results informed revisions of the pilot module , suggesting students likely needed more time to explore the 45 relevant conceptual content surrounding the tool at hand , to develop their understanding of the imaging process further . Revised module : The questions students were asked to gauge their understanding and ideas surrounding NST were updated to ﬁt with the narrower focus of the revised module . At the end of class , students were given an exit sheet with three prompts . We wanted to understand if and how the LEGO model helped build understanding of the AFM , its’ function and its’ purpose AFM as a tool . Student responses were qualitatively studied to ﬁnd in what ways the designed module supported student engagement . The ﬁrst question , “In what ways was the LEGO AFM model helpful in understand - ing how an AFM works ? ? probed students understanding about the usefulness of the LEGO model . One major group of student responses indicated how the model helped students gen - erally . Student responses indicated that they appreciated the accessibility of the model , the ability of the model to show them the different components and the working mech - anisms of the tool . One student response in this category included , “the model was kid - friendly and helped me and visualize the real thing ( AFM ) . ” The second group of student responses informed us of their understanding of the model itself . Student responses in this group elaborated on the speciﬁc subsystem / s ( either the cantilever / needle subsys - tem or the laser / mirror subsystem , or both ) . These responses suggest that the LEGO model helped students see and identify the individual sub systems of the AFM . Overall , an AFM is a complex system where just looking at it and its working , is not enough to understand its working and functionality . Although the LEGO model is a prototype that could not work at the nanoscale , it mimics the AFM’s working principles , highlights the subsystems , and shows how they work together . Therefore , using a scaled - up version of the AFM appears to be useful in unpacking how the tool works , and allows students to get comfortable with a piece of technology that is otherwise inaccessible to them . 46 The second question , “Reﬂect on the usefulness of the AFM . What is the purpose of an AFM ? ” probed student ideas about the purpose or use of the AFM as a tool . Most students mentioned measuring objects at the nanoscale , suggesting that this is generally what students believe to be the purpose of an AFM . It is a generalized view and did not include any speciﬁcs about the properties that could be measured . Another category of student response talked about topographical properties , some speciﬁcally mentioning the “height of the ground” or “heights of surfaces . ’” We found this to be particularly interesting because this points to the potential teacher inﬂuence on students’ framing of their response . For instance , while talking about the ability of AFM to scan surfaces , the teacher used a metaphor of ocean ﬂoor and scanning its’ “bumpy’” surface for study by scientists . Inﬂuence of these metaphors was reﬂected in ways students mentioned “the ground” as the object they would study with an AFM . Analogies help learners imagine new information and hence , in science support the development of new ideas about something ( Duit , 1991 ) . Because the NST content was new , there may be the possibility of student explanations being inﬂuenced by the metaphors used in class . A small , yet deﬁnite number of responses also indicated potential confusion . Since most responses speciﬁcally talked about measuring at the nanoscale , it was difﬁcult to tell whether students realized that there is a difference between measuring topographical properties of a sample at a nanoscale of a large object , versus just seeing the small objects . This may suggest a misconception that students may have about scale , or what the AFM observes . The third question asked , “If we want to image something even smaller , something at the actual nanoscale , how do we change the LEGO AFM ? ” The purpose of this question was to see if students were able to connect the scaled - up LEGO model to the real AFM . The overall trend among student responses was on making the entire system smaller . We noted that most students who elaborated further , chose to point to the cantilever 47 tip / needle and indicated the need to reduce its size , to scan smaller objects . For example , students wrote , “make the needle more precise” and , “you make the needle smaller . ” This may suggest that students saw the cantilever tip as the only point of contact between the sample and the tool . Therefore , they decided to focus on reducing the size of that component . They may have made the connection that a smaller sample will require more precision , thereby requiring a better tip . These responses suggest that students were aware of the scale and size of the model . Finally , in the revised module , a content - based questionnaire that was administered before and after the module , included one descriptive question : Why do you think Nan - otechnology is important ? and two multiple - choice ( MC ) questions focusing on con - cepts of size and scale . We qualitatively analyzed student response to the descriptive question , using thematic analysis ( Braun and Clarke , 2012 ) and analyzed frequency of accurate responses to the MC questions ( Nowell , et al . , 2017 ) . For the pre - questionnaire , most student responses to the descriptive question read , “I don’t know” or indicated similar responses reﬂecting an uncertainty in their think - ing . The majority of the rest of the responses listed another ﬁeld like medicine where Nanotechnology helped , highlighting application of NST . Further , only a small percent - age of responses included speciﬁc details around how NST contributes to speciﬁc ﬁelds like medicine ( example : by ﬁnding new cures ) . This category of response suggested that students had some background ideas about NST and its application to other ﬁelds . For the post module responses , a signiﬁcant change in nature of student response to the descriptive question was observed . More than three - quarters of the student responses included a general statement about size or scale of objects in focus for NST and that the nano scale itself imparts value of this ﬁeld . A few students gave speciﬁc examples to talk about the importance of NST . For example , one student’s pre - module answer was a vague statement about innovation . Their post - module answer was , ‘It allows us 48 to see things at an extremely small scale , for example , a table that may seem smooth to us , a tool such as an AFM would be able to pick up small blemishes and imperfec - tions in the table . ’ Responses like these were not only able to describe the basic idea behind nanoscience ( extremely small scale ) , but also the impact of the tool they were introduced to and what the tool does . Responses that demonstrated these connections suggest that with support , students were able to identify with the purpose and hence the value of AFM , as an important piece if NST technology . We found that for a few students who reﬂected basic understanding of NST even before the module , post the module , reﬂected deeper understanding . For example , a pre - module student response , “Nanotechnology can help us in many ways including : surgery , medical diagnosis and treatment , engineering , science , etc . ” , for post - module response said , “Nanotech can help improve things such as healthcare and things in the medical ﬁeld , or in science and physics to study things that are very small . And so help in diagnosis or treatment effectively . ” While this student continued to relate nanotech - nology to medicine , they also added the concept of size and scale , key ideas of NST ( Stevens , et al . , 2009 ) that play an essential role in the medical ﬁeld . Although few , examples like these highlighted the role of the module and its structure , where our in - tention was to engage students with tools to build upon their ideas ( Papert , 1980 ) . The post module responses included a lot of examples from the medicine ﬁeld . There may be a potential that the module helped students with background knowledge , to build their understanding of NST and its connections with medicine ﬁeld . If students related nanoscience experiences to the ﬁeld of medicine , they might see themselves working in medicine in the future . This could be also linked to the increased interest in the medicine ﬁeld reﬂected in the post S - STEM survey . For the multiple - choice questions , we also found an increase in accuracy of answers . Although not statistically signiﬁcant , the re - sponse showed a positive change . The non - signiﬁcant difference may be because the 49 students did not have enough time to internalize the new ideas . This may also be related to the short module duration , which may be a limitation of our study . 5 . 1 . 3 Classroom Videos Throughout the study , we took audio and video recordings where possible . During both the pilot and revised modules , videos captured whole class discussions and small group work , where students were building models , discussed them with their peers , and shared their builds to the class . As we studied the transcripts , we focused on student ideas and moments of sense - making as they engaged in group or whole class discussions . We mainly studied how students engaged with the modeling task , which required the students to make non - functioning prototypes of the AFM using given materials : card - board , modeling clay , pipe cleaners , toothpicks and popsicle sticks . The only design requirement for the model was to highlight the different components of the LEGO AFM ( the cantilever , the platform , the lasers , the detectors ) . As students discussed their plans and built the models , they were seen mimicking components of the model . We noticed that most students were unable to recollect the names of the AFM parts during both the pilot and revised module . Rather they used body language , gestures and descriptions to denote parts . In this case , where the vocabulary was new , gestures and body language were seen as a productive resource ( Flood , et al . , 2014 ) in building understanding of the new concepts . We did not insist that students come up with the correct words . Rather , we used their descriptions to probe their understanding of the AFM parts and then provided with corresponding vocabulary , promoting concept development ﬁrst and then vocabu - lary building . The modeling task seemed to complement this approach since it allowed students to create their models based on their understanding , which in turn prioritized concept development . We observed that one group in particular , was trying to stabilize the column that would hold the cantilever . They debated over the distance and angle 50 between the cantilever and the detectors ( two AFM sub - systems ) . In doing so , they considered how the position of the reﬂective surface matters in the laser / reﬂector sub - system . They focused on various sub - systems at a time , their inter - dependence and how they work together to produce they image . The hands - on experience that was structured as a group task created space for them to study the subsystems and tease out elements that contribute to the ﬁnal image production . This experience also allowed students to collaborate with their peers , which is a cornerstone of constructionist learning experi - ences ( Harel and Papert , 1991 ) . A good understanding of the tool itself can enable the user to use the technology in better and effective ways to analyze data . We see the ability of our modules to help better understand and hence better utilize the technology . Post the modeling task , students presented their models and explained how their sub - systems of the model work to image a sample . Once again , we noticed that not all groups could use the correct vocabulary to name each system . Yet , they clearly described the role of the part and its position . It suggests that the LEGO model was perhaps useful in visualizing the AFM for students to be able to recreate it accurately . We also noticed that some students took the modeling task one step further and not only made their proto - types able to physically move , but also asked to test their prototype using a laser pointer and reﬂective surface to see if it would work like the LEGO AFM . Others incorpo - rated cantilevers that would move up and down when scanning a surface , like the LEGO model . There are strong implications for the nature of modeling task introduced in the class . Although the task called for students to create non - functional prototypes , the modeling task was not superﬁcial . It helped students build and demonstrate understand - ing of the LEGO AFM model . As students get older , they tend to have fewer hands - on experiences with those being limited to cook - book style lab experiments . However , the freedom to play and manipulate materials in an open - structured way allowed students to creatively supplement their knowledge building and hence contribute to learning the new 51 concept . The accessibility of the materials such as clay and popsicle sticks can make a novel concept like nanotechnology seem less daunting allowing students to explore it at their own pace . We hence ﬁnd that a ) multiple experiences in different formats allow students to make sense of the content in a variety of ways , b ) the LEGO AFM helped students visualize what might be happening inside a true AFM , and c ) giving students the liberty to play with materials is a key module component . 5 . 2 Discussion 5 . 2 . 1 Student Engagement and Evolution of Student Ideas During the introductory lesson students were given a survey asking what they liked most about the lesson . The survey demonstrated excitement towards the LEGO AFM . This , along with agreement from the teachers , ensured we would keep the LEGO AFM as a focus moving forward . Following the introductory session , the pilot module included opportunities for students to reﬂect on the LEGO AFM , and the real AFM . When asked about how the imaging process of the LEGO AFM works , students were able to name individual subsystems or components of the AFM but tended to not connect to the imag - ing process or the subsystems working together as a whole . After the second part of the pilot module , in which students observed real AFM images of the polymer behind a clear plastic cup , students were asked if the AFM images were helpful in understand - ing the differences between the two cup materials . Most students simply rephrased the question in some way . Some students could describe what they saw in the images but typically did not connect their observations to the investigation question or how the im - age was created . However , a few students responded with not only a description of the image , but were also able to connect back to its properties to answer why one cup was more ﬂexible than the other . Responses such as these suggested that with enough scaf - 52 folds and time when breaking down the tool , students may better understand its abilities and applications . This observation inﬂuenced the major revisions to the pilot module , giving students the chance to spend more time with the AFM during the revised mod - ule , engaging in multiple experiences to solidify the concepts . During the pilot module , students also answered questions about potential problems with the LEGO AFM . Stu - dents were able to identify possible points of inaccuracy , mainly pointing to the size and bulkiness of LEGOs or inaccuracy with the laser subsystem . Students also responded to a question asking about changes to be made to the LEGO AFM to make it functional for smaller samples . Most responses focused on the cantilever tip and making it smaller . Neither set of responses elaborated on their statements , nor connected back to the imag - ing process . Vague responses from the students supported the need for extra time with the AFM to better understand the entire system as a whole . Nonetheless , it was clear students were thinking about the functionality of the technology , which was a goal of the technology - based approach . Our results directly fed into the revisions of the pilot module , emphasizing the importance of developing a strong conceptual understanding of the tool as a pre - requisite to understanding its applications . Thus , the revised module focused solely on the LEGO AFM , as described in the previous chapter . Responses to the open - ended question of the content questionnaire from the revised module were analyzed for recurring themes both before and after the module . The pre - module responses showed that the majority of students responded along the lines of “I don’t know . ” However , post - module , the majority of responses mentioned size or scale , a key idea of NST ( Stevens , et al . , 2009 ) . Though our focus was not explic - itly on any particular key idea of NST , students appear to have grasped the concept of size and scale after participating in the revised module . Other post module responses further included speciﬁc examples to highlight the importance of NST ( such as AFM ) . Responses like these suggest that a number of students had enough support during the 53 revised module to identify the function and applications of the AFM . This was a sig - niﬁcant observation , because expanding the time spent exploring the LEGO AFM to better understand the working of the tool was an intentional revision to the pilot mod - ule . Some post - module responses built upon their original ideas from the pre - module questionnaires . Responses such as these echo the structure of the module ; students built upon their ideas of NST after engaging with a technological tool , which was the inten - tion behind a constructionist - inspired , application - based module . The multiple - choice questions showed a positive change in number of accurate answers when comparing the pre - and post - answers , though no statistically signiﬁcant change was found . Exit tickets given to students asked about the usefulness of the LEGO model . We noticed how students were appreciating the LEGO AFM’s accessibility , one response saying it was “kid friendly . ” In other responses , students elaborated on speciﬁc subsys - tems , named particular components , and generally demonstrated understanding of the physical model . Student responses suggest to us the potential engagement and inter - est the tool has created for the students . The student responses also suggest the LEGO model was helpful to students in understanding the AFM . Classroom videos captured the students working together to build and present their own AFM models . First , they were seen building their AFM models . The videos showed that the use of familiar mate - rials during the modeling activity made it easier for students to have conversations about the tool without explicit scientiﬁc vocabulary . It was clear that they were drawing from having seen the LEGO AFM shortly before . The videos showed students in one group discussing the distance between the cantilever and laser beam detector . This moment captured this group of students thinking about the nuances of the build , and what might be required of it , if it were to work . Finally , when the students were asked to present their models at the end of class , the videos showed use of body language and gesture to describe elements of the AFM . However , all groups were able to present their model 54 and explain each components’ function , even if they were lacking the speciﬁc vocabu - lary . This tells us that the modeling approach possibly allowed students to explore the AFM through modeling with familiar materials may have been useful in building their understanding of the tool . Student ideas about the AFM have evolved as a result of using MER to develop NST modules for grade 8 . During the introductory lesson , students were shown the LEGO AFM without much context , but expressed interest in the model . The pilot mod - ule presented students with a lot of information , but in a short amount of time . Student responses from the pilot module echo this , showing that students picked apart individual components of the AFM , but did not connect back to the system as a whole . However , after two rounds of editing attending to student conceptions about the AFM , the revised module resulted in deeper understanding of the tool , its components , and how it works to produce an image . Students were able to build models and describe the models’ subsystems and the way the subsystems work synchronously , even if they did not have the technical language to do so . From this evolution , it is clear that revising a learn - ing experience with consideration of conceptions students already have creates a more meaningful environment for students to explore extremely new scientiﬁc content that would otherwise be inaccessible to them . 5 . 2 . 2 Teacher Preparedness MER includes the teacher perspective during the recursive process , asking teachers to evaluate their own content knowledge ( Component A ) , and account for the student audi - ence ( Component B ) . Throughout the study , teachers’ inputs have been valued towards evaluating and designing the modules . Although the research team presented scientif - ically coherent content knowledge about the AFM and NST , we needed inputs on best ways to introduce the novel content to grade 8 and 9 . The participating expert teach - 55 ers shared the relevant standards , practices , and best facilitation techniques . They also shared ideas about points in their curriculum where the pre - existing content could be connected to NST , such as the connection to polymers in high school chemistry . These inputs helped create an effective learning environment suitable for our target audience of grade 8 and 9 . Our main collaborating teacher worked with us for a period of two years , during which she was involved in the process of looking into relevant standards , suggesting activities for the pilot module , observing the pilot module as a learner , and evaluating the pilot module from that perspective . During the teacher’s engagement with the cyclical MER process , she had the opportunity to continually observe the classroom from an outside perspective ﬁrst , having seen initial facilitation of the content by the researchers during the pilot module . She also had the opportunity to unpack the relevant content herself ﬁrst , as a learner of NST . After engaging with the module from a stu - dents’ perspective , and participating in the revision process , the teacher was then able to comfortably facilitate the revised module . One aspect of MER that I found important was its attention to building on teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge ( PCK ) ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . PCK links understanding of the content with teaching practices ( Shulman , 1987 ) . Shulman considers PCK to be a critical part of successful teaching . Thoroughly formed PCK of a topic can help teachers plan how they will organize and present information or adjust it as needed to attend to different needs of the students ( Van Dijk Kattmann , 2007 ) . Using MER to develop lessons can potentially improve teachers’ PCK as it gives them a chance to evaluate their lesson plans and facilitation strategies for speciﬁc disciplinary learning . During the iterative process , we interviewed the teacher after she facilitated the revised module . We discussed the appropriateness of the content , the alignment of the activities and the materials in facilitating the content , and the level of her preparedness to facilitate . In the interview ( Appendix C ) , the teacher shared that she felt prepared to teach the revised 56 module after the pilot module had been updated , due to becoming familiar with the content and module over time . This evolution may suggest that the teacher developed both her content knowledge about NST , while considering how to best present the novel content to her students . Ultimately , her engagement in this process allowed her to critically evaluate the modules . Her participation provided her with opportunities that could have deepened her content knowledge about NST to where she could have felt conﬁdent to teach the module on her own . While her content knowledge may have been further developed , through participating in the iterative process , it is possible she developed ideas towards her pedagogical knowledge about NST , towards her PCK of NST . While we cannot entirely generalize results based on this particular case , our results do suggest that MER has opportunities for teachers , not just to strengthen their own ideas surrounding novel concepts , but also has the ability to contribute to their pedagogical content knowledge about a topic . Based on the results , we also see the value in using MER as a method of improving teacher PCK to further beneﬁt students in the learning environment . 57 CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS 6 . 1 Conclusions This study included three rounds of developing , implementing , evaluating , and revising an NST module for grade 8 using MER as a framework . The ﬁrst round included discus - sions with teachers and a short presentation with students from grades 8 to 10 to collect initial data and feedback towards planning a module . Feedback from teachers pointed to connections with the relevant standards , support of a technology - based approach , and a connection to polymer labs in chemistry . The students showed positive interest in the LEGO AFM in responses to a post - presentation survey . The second round included the implementation of the pilot module with a different collaborating teacher and a new set of grade 8 students , in which students were introduced to the LEGO AFM , completed a modeling activity , and reﬂected on the LEGO AFM’s usefulness as a model . This was followed by use of a real AFM to examine two different kinds of polymers . Evalua - tion of the pilot module showed students beginning to understand the tools’ individual subsystems but not their collective functions . S - STEM Survey results showed positive changes from pre - to post - module in attitudes towards a handful of STEM careers and subjects . This result informed revisions for the third and ﬁnal round . The revised mod - ule , in turn , included more time breaking down the subsystems that make up an AFM , and the modeling activity . By this point in the cycle , the teacher was able to lead the 58 module . The revised module resulted in students having a clearer understanding of each of the individual components of the AFM , and enhanced understanding of the AFM’s functionality and the key NST concept of size and scale . The revised module also re - sulted in positive change from pre - to post - module in attitude in more STEM careers on the S - STEM surveys than the pilot module . An interview with the collaborating teacher was conducted , where she reiterated that she ultimately felt prepared to teach the NST module after participating in and contributing to the MER cycle . Our results suggest that student ideas about the components and working of an AFM evolved as we cycled through revising the module , conforming to the literature support - ing MER as a lesson development tool for novel science content . Giving students more support , as in multiple experiences regarding the same concepts , and more time with the concepts , can lead to better understanding of a system like an AFM . From implementing this revision and observing the evolution of student ideas , the results suggest that active evaluation and revision can create a more meaningful learning experience wherein stu - dents to discover new concepts through a technology . Use of technology has shown to be an effective starting point for introducing NST . Though we cannot make any di - rect claims about the results from the S - STEM surveys due to the short duration of the modules , the results highlight increased attitudes towards STEM subjects and interest in STEM careers between the pilot and revised module . This result indicates the possibil - ity of revisions attending to student ideas being effective in developing positive attitudes towards STEM , and that a well - developed NST module may have positive impact on student attitudes as well . Finally , a discussion with the teacher demonstrated that par - ticipation in the cyclic process of MER built both content and pedagogical knowledge about teaching NST for that particular teacher . While this result is not generalizable , it does suggest that participation in MER may enhance teachers’ PCK . 59 6 . 2 Limitations The main limitation I perceive for this study is that the scale of the study does not al - low us to generalize our results . The pilot and revised modules were only implemented with one teacher at one school , for short durations . One goal of the study was to in - vestigate changes in students’ attitudes towards STEM via the S - STEM surveys after participating in the modules . Research has shown that when shaping student’s overall beliefs or attitudes towards a discipline , longer periods of exposure can have a deeper inﬂuence ( Tang , Delgado , and Moje , 2014 ) . However , it can be challenging for teachers to accommodate implementation of a new module within their plans . Research has also suggested that teachers with less experience with a topic like NST may be less com - fortable implementing unfamiliar content in their classrooms ( Blonder and Sakhnini , 2017 ) . Therefore , our study was limited to these constraints . Because the modules indi - vidually ran for short periods of time for each group of students , we cannot make direct claims about the results of the S - STEM surveys . Nevertheless , results from the surveys highlight a positive shift in students’ attitudes as a result of the learning experience . 6 . 3 Implications Our results demonstrate the MER’s effectiveness in developing , implementing , evaluat - ing , and revising a learning experience to ultimately create a more meaningful environ - ment for students to discover new ideas that would typically be out of reach for their grade level . Based on our results , we suggest the use of MER to develop NST content for late middle school students and introduce the NST content to teachers . Attending to student ideas when planning a lesson ensures that the facilitation is well suited to the audience ( Duit , et al . , 2012 ) . Meanwhile , teachers’ participation in the MER pro - 60 cess can positively impact their combined pedagogical and content knowledge about the subject matter ( Kattmann , et al . , 1996 ) . Though our study focuses on NST speciﬁcally , the MER can be applied more broadly to related scientiﬁc disciplines to improve science teaching and learning . Based on the results pertaining to the structure of the module , we suggest the use of a technological tool to introduce NST concepts as early as grade 8 . The technology - based approach created a meaningful environment for students’ contextualized learning . Student responses throughout the modules showed that the LEGO AFM was useful in helping students visualize and understand objects at a scale that is otherwise invisible to them . Along with a focus on application - based approach for exploring newer concepts , we also focused on hands - on learning and attempted to give students thinking spaces , enabling them to discover NST concepts with self - and peer - guided experiences . A goal of the study was to investigate students’ attitudes towards STEM throughout implementation of the modules . Research has shown that study of nanoscale properties using technology can spark students’ excitement about STEM ﬁelds ( Greenberg , 2009 ) . As the module was revised , the S - STEM surveys showed even higher positive change in the pre - and post - module results between the pilot and revised module . Use of MER may be helpful in shaping students’ attitudes and beliefs towards STEM subjects and careers . At the same time , application - based experiences can help students seamlessly translate content learned in school to industry ( Roco and Bainbridge , 2005 ) . Therefore , an NST module like ours could have the potential to contribute to the next generation of the STEM workforce . 61 6 . 4 Reﬂections As a student of physics , a core discipline that is closely related to NST , participating in the study has given me a new perspective on teaching topics with underlying physics concepts . Both working within the MER framework , and developing a technology - based learning experience to introduce new concepts have been valuable to me as a learner and educator . In this section , I will share some reﬂections on this experience , after having worked on this study since I began my program , almost two years ago . One of the key aspects of the MER framework is the consideration of students’ pre - existing conceptions about a topic when creating a learning experience for them , regardless of how they are reasoned or articulated . I entered my undergraduate studies in physics coming from a performing arts high school , where options for math and science classes were scarce . Because of this , I often struggled during physics classes that were lecture - heavy and entirely abstract , not having thoroughly developed fundamental pre - calculus and calculus concepts . Having limited exposure to physics and the related math was my context as a student entering undergraduate physics classes , a background that my professors might not have considered . Though this study has been with grade 8 students and I am reﬂecting on my college experience , I found myself noticing the value of this component of MER . It is logical that a learning experience may be more meaningful to more students if a variety of backgrounds are considered during planning . I also found multiple kinds of experiences or teaching angles to be useful when trying to understand how a system of any kind ( abstract or tangible ) works . I wondered why I had not typically seen this kind of approach in my physics classes ; after all , understanding a system is often the goal in physics . Having seen the beneﬁt of breaking down a machine to its barest components and functions before using it , I wish I had more experience in instrumentation and modern 62 technology throughout not just my undergraduate career , but in K - 12 as well . The AFM is a tool that physicists use today ( Pooser , et al . , 2020 ) , and I had no prior exposure to it myself . Personally , it is possible that exposure to the AFM or any other modern industry tool would have had a positive effect on me as a student having to consider college and career choices . The meaningful experiences throughout my high school physics , math , and astronomy classes led me to an interest in an astrophysics major in college , so it would not be unexpected for me to have enjoyed an NST module like ours . However , I am just one student with lifelong general interest towards STEM subjects . Still , after this experience , I hope access to NST industry tools continues to expand for students in all grades . Anecdotally , I have seen that modern technologies appeal to students in grades 7 - 12 and based on participating in this study and my personal experience , I believe students would likely beneﬁt from working with industry tools before they go on to make college and career choices . Currently , my only experience teaching is having taught introductory undergraduate physics classes both in a university setting and a test preparation setting . Otherwise , participating in this study has been the ﬁrst time I have worked with K - 12 students . During this experience , I have introduced myself to educational theory I had not seen before , including constructivism / constructionism , MER , and the 5E model . Though I have had a brief introduction to learning theories in a previous educational psychology course , I had much to learn about these frameworks for learning and teaching before contributing to module planning . However , I have come out of this experience with some newfound training in science teaching , that I would not otherwise have received studying physics alone . 63 APPENDIX A S - STEM SURVEYS 64 65 66 67 68 69 APPENDIX B CONTENT QUESTIONNAIRE 70 APPENDIX C TEACHER INTERVIEW QUESTIONS Proﬁle questions : 1 .
