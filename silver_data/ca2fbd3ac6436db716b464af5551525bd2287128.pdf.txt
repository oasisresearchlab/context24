Here , we com - bined quantitative proteomics with CBP / p300 - spe - ciﬁc catalytic inhibitors , bromodomain inhibitor , and gene knockout to reveal a comprehensive map of regulated acetylation sites and their dynamic turn - over rates . CBP / p300 acetylates thousands of sites , including signature histone sites and a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer - associated transcriptional regulators . Time - resolved acetylome analyses identiﬁed a subset of CBP / p300 - regulated sites with very rapid ( < 30 min ) acetylation turnover , revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation . Quantiﬁcation of acetylation , mRNA , and protein abundance after CBP / p300 inhi - bition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP / p300 - catalyzed rapid acetylation . Collectively , our in - depth acetylome analyses reveal systems attri - butes of CBP / p300 targets , and the resource dataset provides a framework for investigating CBP / p300 functions and for understanding the impact of small - molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodomain activities . INTRODUCTION Lysine N - ε - acetylation is a reversible protein post - translational modiﬁcation ( PTM ) that regulates diverse cellular processes , and its dysregulation has been linked to cancer and other dis - eases ( Verdin and Ott , 2015 ; Yang and Seto , 2008 ) . Advance - ments in mass spectrometry ( MS ) - based proteomics have led to identiﬁcation of thousands of acetylation sites in mammalian cells ( Choudhary et al . , 2009 , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ) . However , a systematic understanding of the acetylome is hampered by two fundamental deﬁciencies : ( 1 ) for a vast majority of acetyla - tion sites , the responsible lysine acetyltransferases ( KATs ) are not known , and ( 2 ) almost nothing is known about site - speciﬁc kinetics of acetylation . The need for establishing enzyme - sub - strate relationship is further accentuated by recent studies , indi - cating that acetylation occurs by both enzyme - catalyzed and non - enzymatic mechanisms ( Wagner and Hirschey , 2014 ; Weinert et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . Therefore , distinguishing enzyme - regulated sites from a potentially large fraction of non - enzymatic acetylation and obtaining a thorough understanding of site - spe - ciﬁc acetylation kinetics are urgently needed to obtain a func - tional understanding of the acetylome . A major bottleneck in this area has been the lack of speciﬁc KAT inhibitors that can be used to identify the in vivo substrates of KATs and to obtain time - resolved dynamics of the acetylome . Recently , we identi - ﬁed ﬁrst - in - class catalytic inhibitors for the acetyltransferases CREBBP ( CBP ) and EP300 ( p300 ) ( Lasko et al . , 2017 ; Michae - lides et al . , 2017 ) , paving the way for a systematic analysis of their functions . CBP and p300 deﬁne a unique family of KATs that are often referredtoasasingleentity ( CBP / p300 ) becauseoftheirextensive sequence homology and functional similarity ( Ogryzko et al . , 1996 ) . CBP / p300 is implicated in a multitude of processes , prominently including the regulation of enhancer - dependent , cell - type - speciﬁc gene transcription . Dysregulation of CBP / p300 is associated with diverse medical conditions , for example , recur - ringsomaticmutationsin CREBBP and EP300 areassociatedwith Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Inc . 231 A B C D E F G H Cmpd - R ( n = 14 , 607 ) A - 485 ( n = 11 , 607 ) 12 . 2 % 2 . 5 % 18 . 6 % 1 . 6 % 13 . 4 % 0 . 16 % CH 1 CH 1 BRD P HD ZZ T A Z 2 KAT CBP / p300 knockout ( KO ) Acetyltransferase inhibitors ( Cmpd - R , A - 485 ) Bromodomain inhibitor ( CBP112 ) Transcriptome Proteome Acetylome Log10 A c s i t e i n t en s i t y 6 7 8 9 10 11 Log2 Ac ratio ( Cmpd - R / Ctrl ) 0 10 − 10 Log10 A c s i t e i n t en s i t y 6 5 7 8 9 10 11 Log2 Ac ratio ( A - 485 / Ctrl ) 0 10 − 10 # quantified sites ( 21 , 034 ) 1015 790 1090 271 493 5365 2467 761 2757 7341072 424 782 2873 863 KO ( 11 , 979 ) A - 485 ( 11 , 607 ) CBP112 ( 12 , 773 ) Cmpd - R ( 14 , 607 ) KO ( n = 11 , 979 ) 23 . 2 % 3 . 1 % Log10 A c s i t e i n t en s i t y 6 5 7 8 9 10 11 Log2 Ac ratio ( KO / Ctrl ) 0 10 − 10 CBP112 ( n = 12 , 773 ) 0 . 85 % 1 . 1 % Log10 A c s i t e i n t en s i t y 6 5 7 8 9 10 11 Log2 Ac ratio ( CBP112 / Ctrl ) 0 10 − 10 Log2 Ac ratio ( KO / Ctrl ) 0 10 − 10 Log2 A c r a t i o ( C m pd - R / C t r l ) 0 10 − 10 n = 7 , 723 , r = 0 . 79 , P < 2e − 16 0 . 09 % Log2 Ac ratio ( KO / Ctrl ) 0 10 − 10 0 10 − 10 Log2 A c r a t i o ( A - 485 / C t r l ) n = 6 , 550 , r = 0 . 80 , P < 2e − 16 16 . 7 % 660 75 1036 KO KO Cmpd - R Cmpd - R 213 239 1193 Cmpd - R A - 485 658 89 1095 KO A - 485 Log2 A c r a t i o − 6 − 4 − 20 Log2 A c r a t i o − 6 − 4 − 2 0 Log2 A c r a t i o − 6 − 4 − 20 KO vs .

CBP / p300 is a multifunctional protein ; it contains a catalytic domain that functions as an acetyllysine ‘‘writer’’ and a bromo - domain ( BRD ) that functions as an acetyllysine ‘‘reader’’ that binds to acetylated proteins . CBP / p300 is also reported to func - tion as an E3 and E4 ligase for protein ubiquitylation ( Shi et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to these functions , CBP / p300 serves as a scaf - fold for recruiting a large repertoire of proteins , including tran - scription factors and co - activators , and several other reported KATs , such as NCOA1 , NCOA3 , ATF2 , and CLOCK ( Drazic et al . , 2016 ) . Traditionally , the identiﬁcation of CBP / p300 targets has focused on individual proteins and relied on CBP / p300 overex - pression , genetic knockdown and knockout or in vitro assays . However , given the intrinsic limitations of the aforementioned approaches and the association of CBP / p300 with several other reported KATs , it is unclear whether all of the identiﬁed sites are directly acetylated by CBP / p300 in vivo . Because genetic deple - tion of CBP / p300 simultaneously eliminates both its catalytic and scaffolding functions , it was previously difﬁcult to disentangle these functions in substrate acetylation and transcriptional regulation . Here , we combine quantitative proteomics with selective chemical inhibitors and genetic knockout cells to obtain a sys - tems - wide understanding of the CBP / p300 acetylome , to inves - tigate site - speciﬁc acetylation dynamics , and to unravel the functions of CBP / p300 in transcriptome and proteome regula - tion . Our data delineates the catalytic , bromodomain , and scaf - folding functions of CBP / p300 in regulating protein acetylation , as well as in mRNA and protein expression . RESULTS A High - Conﬁdence Map of the CBP / p300 Acetylome To investigate the CBP / p300 acetylome , we used three different , but complementary , perturbations : gene knockout ( KO ) , highly speciﬁc CBP / p300 KAT inhibitors , and a bromodomain inhibitor ( Figure 1A ) . CBP / p300 was conditionally knocked out in Crebbp ﬂ / ﬂ ; ep300 ﬂ / ﬂ mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) ( Kas - per et al . , 2010 ) expressing a tamoxifen - inducible Cre recombi - nase . CBP / p300 KAT activity was inhibited with the recently developed potent and selective small - molecule inhibitors : com - pound R ( Cmpd - R ) and A - 485 ( Figure S1A ) ( Lasko et al . , 2017 ) . These two inhibitors are structurally related and show similar inhibitory activities for CBP / p300 in vitro and in cell - based as - says ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . The CBP / p300 bromodomain was selectively inhibited using the small - molecule CBP112 ( Picaud et al . , 2015 ) . We applied stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) - based quantitative MS to identify CBP / p300 - regulated acetylation sites . We quantiﬁed (cid:1) 21 , 000 acetylation sites on (cid:1) 5 , 300 proteins and more than 11 , 500 sites on 3 , 500 proteins in each condition ( Figures 1B and S1D ; Table S1 ; Table S2 ) . We additionally quantiﬁed proteome levels to calibrate acet - ylation measurements for differences in protein abundance ( Table S1 ; Table S2 ) . Acetylation changes were strongly corre - lated across biological replicates ( Figure S1E ) , indicating excel - lent reproducibility . CBP / p300 KO and catalytic inhibition resulted in extensively downregulated acetylation that was highly correlated ( Figures 1D – 1F ) . Nearly all sites ( 93 % ) that were downregulated ( > 2 - fold ) by the catalytic inhibitors were also downregulated in KO cells ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . However , a greater proportion ( (cid:1) 40 % ) of sites was exclusively downregu - lated in KO cells . This is likely due to the greater magnitude of reduced acetylation in KO cells ( Figures 1D and 1E , compare boxplots for overlapping sites ) that is attributable to the different time periods of treatment ( 72 hr for KO , 16 hr for catalytic inhib - itors ) . There was a greater overlap between sites regulated by Cmpd - R and A - 485 ( Figure 4F ) as compared to KO ( Figures 1D and 1E ) , and , in all comparisons , the non - overlapping sites were close to the 2 - fold cutoff for regulation ( Figures 1D – 1F , compare boxplots for non - overlapping sites ) . These data indi - cate that KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 caused reduced acetylation at the same acetylation sites and that the non - overlap of regu - lated sites is mostly attributable to weakly regulated sites that fall on either side of the cutoff used to classify regulated sites . CBP112 caused modestly reduced acetylation compared to KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 ( Figure 1C ; Table S1 ) , and most ( 74 % ) of the CBP112 - regulated sites were also regulated in KO cells ( Figure S1F ) . Together , these results comprehensively verify the in vivo speciﬁcity of Cmpd - R and A - 485 and show that loss of catalytic activity alone has an impact on acetylation that is similar to that of loss of the entire CBP / p300 protein , indi - cating that loss of CBP / p300 catalytic activity is the primary cause of reduced acetylation observed in the KO cells . Properties of the CBP / p300 Acetylome For the purposes of bioinformatic analyses , we deﬁned sites with > 2 - fold reduced acetylation as CBP / p300 - regulated . Based on the fraction of 2 - fold downregulated sites in an unperturbed control experiment ( 0 . 73 % ) ( Figure S2A ) , we estimated the false discovery rate ( FDR ) for CBP / p300 - regulated sites in the KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 experiments to be 3 . 1 % , 6 . 0 % , and 3 . 9 % , respectively , which is comparable to a p value of 0 . 05 . A small fraction of sites in KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 were not quantiﬁed ( Figure 1G ) , because acetylation was only detected in control cells ( i . e . , wild - type MEFs or control - treated cells ) , suggesting that loss of CBP / p300 activity may have reduced acetylation to a level that was not detectable . Notably , not quantiﬁed sites occurred less frequently in CBP112 - treated cells ( Figure 1G ) , and not quantiﬁed sites in KO cells showed markedly reduced acetylation by Cmpd - R and A - 485 , but not by CBP112 ( Figure 1H ) . These not quantiﬁed sites are putative targets of ( G ) The fraction ( % ) of sites that were not quantiﬁed ( i . e . , acetylated peptide detected only in control samples , but not in the KO or the catalytic inhibitor - treated samples ) in the indicated experiments .

CBP / p300 was strongly biased to acetylate nuclear proteins , whereas cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins were under - represented ( Figure 2A ) . Remarkably , 36 % , 22 % , and 30 % of sites on proteins associated with the UniProt keyword ‘‘Nucleus’’ were regulated by KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 , respectively ; indi - cating that up to one - third of the nuclear acetylome is regulated by CBP / p300 . Consistent with its role as a transcriptional coac - tivator , CBP / p300 - regulated sites were signiﬁcantly enriched for keywords describing transcription and chromatin regulation ( Figures 2B and S2B ) . Analysis of amino acids ﬂanking CBP / p300 - regulated sites did not reveal a prominent motif , with the exception of a modest enrichment of Ala , Pro , Gly , and Ser at the (cid:3) 2 position ( Fig - ure S2C ) . However , CBP / p300 - regulated sites were signiﬁcantly biased to occur at lysine residues that were in close proximity ( Figures 2C , S2D , and S2E ) , and proteins with CBP / p300 - regu - lated sites had a signiﬁcantly higher tendency to interact with each other ( Figure 2D ) . Furthermore , among regulated proteins , two - thirds of the detected sites were acetylated by CBP / p300 , and among highly regulated proteins ( > 4 regulated sites ) , 82 % of sites were acetylated by CBP / p300 ( Figure 2E ) , indicating that CBP / p300 acetylates a majority of sites on targeted pro - teins . A closer inspection of CBP / p300 targets showed different acetylation patterns ; some proteins , such as Bcl9 , Ncoa2 , and Kmt2d , were regulated at nearly every site , other proteins , such as Parp1 , Ncl , and Thrap3 , showed a mixture of regulated and unregulated sites ( Figure S3A ) , and some proteins were regulated at a conserved position in homologous proteins ( Figure S3B ) . We examined the relationship between regulation by CBP / p300 and acetylation abundance at individual sites by using abundance - corrected intensity ( ACI ) to estimate relative acetylation stoichiometry ( Weinert et al . , 2014 ) ( Table S2 ) . Consistent with enzyme - catalyzed acetylation , CBP / p300 - regulated sites had signiﬁcantly ( p < 2 3 10 (cid:3) 16 ) higher ACI compared with unregulated sites , and the most robustly regulated sites ( > 8 - fold reduced acetylation ) had the highest ACI ( Figure 2F ) . We ranked all acetylation sites by ACI and classiﬁed the top 5 % as having ‘‘high stoichiometry’’ and the bottom 95 % as having ‘‘low stoichiometry . ’’ Strikingly , CBP / p300 acetylated a majority of ‘‘high stoichiometry’’ acetylation sites in all experiments , but a much smaller fraction of ‘‘low stoichiometry’’ acetylation ( Figure 2G ) , indicating that CBP / p300 is one of the most prominent nuclear KAT activities in cells .

See also Figures S2 , S3 , and S4 . 234 Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 The Cellular Context Contributes to CBP / p300 Speciﬁcity Our data indicate that CBP and p300 are relatively promiscuous KATs that target neighboring sites on proximal proteins . To vali - date these ﬁndings , and to further explore the speciﬁcity of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation , we used a combination of in vitro acetylation assays and overexpression in cells . We ﬁrst tested the ability of recombinant p300 to acetylate six puriﬁed human proteins that were identiﬁed as CBP / p300 targets . These six proteins contained 20 acetylation sites that were regulated in KO and inhibitor - treated cells . We found that recombinant p300 acetylated these same sites in vitro , as acet - ylation increased more than 2 - fold or was only detected in p300 - treated samples ( Figure S3C ) . In addition , acetylation was also increased at nearly all other detected sites ; more than half of all sites were only detected after acetylation by p300 ( Figure S3D ) , and of the remaining sites , acetylation increased more than 2 - fold at > 78 % of sites ( Figure S3E ) . We used SILAC quantiﬁcation to measure in vitro acetylation of whole cell lysates by puriﬁed p300 ( Table S2 ) . p300 caused extensive acetylation ( 48 % of sites increased more than 2 - fold over control ) ; however , increased acetylation was weakly correlated ( r = (cid:3) 0 . 20 ) with reduced acetylation in the KO cells ( Figure 2H ) . Indeed , half of the sites that showed increased acetylation by p300 in vitro were unaffected in KO cells , sug - gesting a low speciﬁcity of acetylation under these conditions . In contrast , increased acetylation caused by ectopic expression of p300 in human 293FT cells was much better correlated ( r = (cid:3) 0 . 57 ) with reduced acetylation in KO cells ( Figure 2I ; Table S2 ) . 80 % of sites that showed reduced acetylation in KO cells were increased after transfection with p300 , whereas 65 % of the sites with increased acetylation were also reduced in KO cells , showing that overexpressed p300 targets many of the sites that were regulated in KO and catalytic - inhibitor - treated cells . These results show that p300 is a promiscuous KAT in vitro , and overexpressed p300 in cells shows greater sub - strate speciﬁcity as compared to recombinant p300 in in vitro assays , indicating that the cellular environment contributes to CBP / p300 substrate speciﬁcity . The CBP / p300 Acetylome Is Conserved To further conﬁrm the impact of CBP / p300 catalytic inhibition on the acetylome in a different cell type and to assess whether CBP / p300 targets the same proteins in human cells , we quan - tiﬁed acetylation in Cmpd - R - treated Kasumi - 1 cells . Kasumi - 1 is a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line whose growth depends on CBP / p300 - dependent acetylation of the oncopro - tein AML1 - ETO ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Similar to MEFs , Cmpd - R - treated Kasumi - 1 showed widespread ( 20 % of all sites , 34 % of nuclear sites ) reduced acetylation ( Figure S4A ; Table S2 ) . Regulated acetylation sites were signiﬁcantly biased to occur on nuclear proteins , and proteins with regulated sites were signiﬁcantly enriched for UniProt keywords describing transcription and chromatin regulation ( Figures S4B and S4C ) . Notably , the acetylomes of Cmpd - R - treated MEF and Kasumi - 1 cells were well correlated ( r = 0 . 77 ) ( Figure S4D ) , indi - cating that CBP / p300 acetylated conserved sites in mouse and human cells . Acetylation of Diverse Signaling Effectors Acetylation by CBP / p300 critically regulates the transcriptional activity of non - histone proteins , such as transcription factors ( Spange et al . , 2009 ) . We found that CBP / p300 acetylates over 200 transcription factors , chromatin remodelers , and transcrip - tional co - activators ( Figure S5 ) . In particular , CBP / p300 acety - lated nearly all members of the bHLH - PAS family of transcrip - tional regulators quantiﬁed in our dataset , including Ncoa1 , Ncoa2 , Ncoa3 , Arnt / Arnt2 , Arntl , and Bmal1 ( Table S2 ) . Addi - tional CBP / p300 targets include many signature transcriptional effectors in signaling pathways related to development and dif - ferentiation , including Wnt - beta catenin , hippo , hedgehog , notch , and transforming growth factor - beta ( TGF - b ) signaling ( Figure 3A ) . CBP / p300 also acetylated key proteins in pathways regulating nutrient and energy metabolism , such as AMPK , PKA , and calcineurin signaling , consistent with a role of CBP / P300 in regulating energy homeostasis ( Bedford and Brindle , 2012 ) . Taken together , these results show extensive CBP / p300 - depen - dent acetylation of non - histone proteins and place CBP / p300 at the nexus of diverse signaling pathways . Acetylation of Enhancer - Associated Regulators CBP / p300 is implicated in enhancer - regulated gene transcrip - tion , and the CBP / p300 - catalyzed H3K27ac mark is used to deﬁne active enhancers ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ) , but the extent of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation at enhancers is not fully known . Comparison of our acetylome data with an experimen - tally determined BCL9L - Wnt enhanceosome ( van Tienen et al . , 2017 ) showed that nearly every detected component of the BCL9L - Wnt enhanceosome is acetylated by CBP / p300 ( Fig - ure 3B ) ; a remarkable ﬁnding considering that the BCL9L - Wnt enhanceosome was puriﬁed from a different cell type and organ - ism than used here . CBP / p300 acetylates more than three dozen enhancer - associated transcriptional regulators , such as the cohesion complex , Mll3 / 4 complex , mediator complex , super elongation complex ( SEC ) , and components of the general tran - scription machinery ( Figure 3C ) . These proteins harbored more than 150 CBP / p300 - regulated acetylation sites in KO cells , and CBP / p300 acetylated a majority ( 65 % ) of the sites detected on these proteins . Together , these results show that CBP / p300 acetylates hundreds of sites on enhancer - associated proteins , revealing that the scope of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation at enhancers far exceeds what is currently known , and indicating that H3K27ac represents the ‘‘tip of the iceberg’’ of CBP / p300 targets at enhancers . Kinetic Analysis of the CBP / p300 Acetylome The dynamic turnover rate of acetylation at individual sites remains an almost completely unexplored question . We ex - ploited the rapid action of CBP / p300 catalytic inhibitors to obtain site - speciﬁc kinetics of acetylation on a proteome - wide scale . SILAC - based quantitative MS was used to quantify acetylation at various times following treatment with A - 485 ( Table S3 ) . The number of CBP / p300 - regulated sites increased in a temporal manner ( Figures 4A and 4B ) , and an increasing time period of treatment showed an increasing correlation to reduced acetyla - tion after 16 hr of exposure to A - 485 ( Figure 4C ) . We quantiﬁed a total of (cid:1) 8 , 100 sites , of which 3 , 011 were quantiﬁed at all six time Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 235 points . The sites quantiﬁed across all time points were clustered into three groups ; ‘‘unregulated , ’’ ‘‘slow , ’’ and ‘‘fast’’ regulated ( Figure 4D ) , and deacetylation half - lives were calculated for the 619 sites that showed reduced acetylation within this time frame . Although we limited our calculation of acetylation half - life to sites quantiﬁed at all six time points , all additional measurements are accessible ( Table S3 ) , and the data can be visualized using the web resource ( see details below ) . Deacetylation half - lives of regulated sites were broadly distributed , with a median half - life of 94 min ( Figure 4E ) . Reduced acetylation after catalytic inhibition can be attributed to the action of lysine deacetylases ( KDACs ) or protein turn - over . Comparison of acetylation turnover rates to protein half - life in NIH 3T3 cells ( McShane et al . , 2016 ) , showed that KDAC activity is mainly responsible for the rapid turnover of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation ( Figure 4F ) . Furthermore , indi - vidual proteins harbored sites with different deacetylation kinetics ( Figure S6A ) , indicating that deacetylation is regulated at the site level . Notably , rapidly deacetylated sites ( t 1 / 2 < 30 min ) had signiﬁcantly higher relative acetylation A B Experimentally defined Bcl9l - Wnt enhanceosome Bcl9lArid1aArid1bNcor1Ncoa2Tle3Ncor2 Smarca4Tle1Qser1Rbm14Gse1Ncoa3 Znf609Tle4Bahcc1Ncoa6Ep300Pygo2ArntLdb1CrebbpNcoa1Smarca2Gata4 Hippo Yap1 Hedgehog Gli3 Notch Rbpj Maml2 Mamld1 Snw1 Notch2 Zmiz1 Maml1 Maml3 Wnt Ctnnb1 Pygo1 Tcf4 Bcl9 Bcl9l Myc Pygo2 Circadian Cry1 Thrap3 Bmal1 TGF - β Trim33 Smad2 Ski Nuclearhormonereceptor Ncoa1 Znf638 Ncoa3 Ncoa6 Ncoa2 CalcineurinLKB - AMPK Ubn1 Ubn2 Cabin1 Crtc2 Crtc3 Crtc1 Key not identified not regulated > 2x reduced > 4x reduced > 8x reduced K O A 485 C m pd - R C H2BK120ub Mediator complex GTFs p p p p p P - TEFb Promoter H3K27ac H2B - Nt - ac Active Enhancer Superelongationcomplex H3K27me3 H3K4me1 and me2 Paused Mnat1 1 Ctdp1 1 Rnf40 4 Eed 1 Ell2 1 Gtf2f1 2 Utx 1 Cohensioncomplex MLL3 / 4 complex Key number of regulated sites gene name fraction of detected sites that are regulated > 2x > 4x > 8x maximum fold - downregulation Nipbl 15 CBP 31 Dpy30 2 Kmt2c 18 Kmt2d 23 Ncoa6 13 p300 28 Ptip 3 Rnf20 6 Wdr5 2 Aff1 6 Aff3 5 Aff4 7 Brd4 12 Ccnt1 6 Cdk7 1 Eaf1 3 Ell 1 Gtf2e1 1 Gtf2e2 1 Gtf2f2 3 Hdac1 3 Med1 10 Med12 3 Med13l 6 Med28 1 1 Med13 Med8 3 Mllt1 5 Mllt3 7 Nipbl 20 Pds5a 9 Pds5b 5 Polr2a 4 Stag2 2 Figure 3 .

Histone Acetylation by CBP / p300 All four core histones are reported to be acetylated by CBP / p300 ( Schiltz et al . , 1999 ) , often redundantly with other KATs ( Roth et al . , 2001 ) . However , a broad survey of CBP / p300 - regulated histone acetylation marks has not been reported . We quantiﬁed acetylation at nearly all known histone sites ( Table S2 ) , enabling us to obtain a comprehensive map of endogenous CBP / p300 - catalylzed histone acetylation marks . To minimize redundant data points , we calculated the median acetylation ratio , summed intensity , and median deacetylation half - life by combining iso - form - speciﬁc histone sites that occurred at the same position in different histone isoforms ( Table S4 ) . CBP / p300 acetylated sites on all four core histones ; however , to a differing degree and site speciﬁcity . The degree of regulation was most pronounced for sites on H2B and H3 ; acetylation of H3K18 , H3K27 , H3K36 , and N - terminal H2B sites was 95 % – 99 % reduced by KO , Cmpd - R , or A - 485 , indicating that these sites are almost exclusively acetylated by CBP / p300 ( Figure 5A ) .

Sitesareorderedfromthe least to the most intense and colored by their regulation in KO cells ( log2 Ac ratio KO / Ctrl ) . See also Figure S6 and Table S4 . Acetylation sites on H2A and H4 were reduced to a lesser degree , suggesting that these sites could be targeted by addi - tional KATs or are not deacetylated to the same degree . CBP / p300 showed remark - able selectivity for sites on H3 , targeting K18 and K27 , whereas neighboring sites at K14 and K23 were unaffected . In contrast , H2A and H2B were regulated on nearly all N - terminal sites , which constituted over half of all sites on these histones , revealing more extensive regu - lation of H2A and H2B N termini by CBP / p300 than previously reported . To gain further insights into CBP / p300 - regulated histone sites , we examined their site - speciﬁc turnover rates and acetylated peptide intensity ( estimated abundance ) ( Table S4 ) . We calcu - lated deacetylation half - lives for 14 of the 20 histone sites that were identiﬁed as regulated in KO cells . H2B N - terminal sites had the fastest turnover rates , and 12 histone sites displayed half - livesoflessthan1hr ( Figure5B ) . AcomparisonofH2Bdeace - tylation kinetics showed that N - terminal sites were rapidly deace - tylated , whereas K20 and K23 were deacetylated at a slightly slowerrate , andC - terminalsiteswerecompletelyunaffected ( Fig - ure5C ) . Acomparisonofacetylatedpeptideintensityshowedthat N - terminal H2B sites were among the most high intensity histone sites ( Figure 5D ) . Extensive regulation by CBP / p300 , rapid turn - over , and high intensity indicate that N - terminal H2B acetylation is a robust , multisite mark that , like H3K18ac and H3K27ac , is a signature for CBP / p300 catalytic activity on chromatin . Collec - tively , these results provide a ﬁrst MS - based quantitative map of CBP / p300 - regulated histone sites in mammalian cells , demon - stratingthatCBP / p300indeedtargetsallfourcorehistones invivo , but the magnitude of regulation , site - speciﬁcity , and kinetics of deacetylation are distinct for individual sites and histones . InadditiontoacetylatingsitesonhistoneNtermini , CBP / p300is also reported to acetylate a distinct class of histone sites that are 238 Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 located in the globular or C - terminal domains , including H3K56 , H3K122 , and H2BK120 ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Das et al . , 2009 ; Trop - berger et al . , 2013 ) . However , CBP / p300 did not acetylate any of these sites in our experiments ( Figure 5A ) . We used recombinant acetylatedH3K56asaspike - instandardtoverifythelackofregu - lation by CBP / p300 at this position ( Figure S6B ) . Using site - speciﬁc antibodies , we found a modest effect of Cmpd - R on H3K56ac and H3K122ac , whereas H2BK120ac was strongly reduced ( Figure S6C ) . Thus , we observed some regulation of these sites using acetylation - site - speciﬁc antibodies , but not by MS . Similarly , the antibodies detected increased acetylation at all three of these sites after treatment with the KDAC inhibitor tri - costatin A ( TSA ) ( Figure S6C ) , even though a previous study using MS showed that these same sites were unaffected by a panel of KDAC inhibitors , including TSA ( Figure S5D ) ( Scho¨lz et al . , 2015b ) . Our MS - baseddata indicate that thesesites arenot regu - lated by CBP / p300 , and our analysis suggests that previous ﬁnd - ings may be a result of antibody cross - reactivity . Indeed , many PTM site - speciﬁc antibodies show cross - reactivity or non - speci - ﬁcity ( Egelhofer et al . , 2011 ) , highlighting the importance of quan - titative MS in deﬁning regulated histone acetylation sites . CBP / p300 Affects the Proteome by Regulating Gene Transcription To delineate the roles of different CBP / p300 functionalities in gene transcription we measured transcript abundance in KO , F G D E A B C Figure 6 .

Cmpd - R and CBP112 were added at the same time as FICZ . ( G ) FICZ - induced Cyp1a1 transcript expression relative to time = 0 . For Cmpd - R - treated samples , the inhibitor was added at the 1 - hr time point , and Cyp1a1 expression was determined at the 2 - and 3 - hr time points . See also Tables S1 and S6 . Cmpd - R , A - 485 , and CBP112 - treated cells at the same time points and condi - tions used for acetylome and proteome analysis ( 72 hr for KO , 16 hr for inhibitor - treated cells ) ( Table S1 ; Table S5 ) . Tran - scriptional changes in KO cells were well correlated ( r = 0 . 75 – 0 . 76 ) to catalytic inhibitor - treated cells ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . The transcriptional changes by Cmpd - R and A - 485 were highly correlated ( r = 0 . 94 ) ( Figure 6C ) , indicating that these compounds have a nearly identical impact on gene expression . The reduced corre - lation between catalytic inhibitors and KO cells is likely attribut - able to the different time periods of these interventions . Loss of CBP / p300 protein or catalytic activity caused reduced expression at a subset of genes ( 11 . 3 % in KO cells , 11 . 6 % in Cmpd - R , and 10 . 4 % in A - 485 ) , and gene expression was more frequently downregulated than upregulated , particularly for strongly regulated ( > 4 - fold change ) genes ( Table S1 ) . Transcrip - tional changes caused by CBP112 were modest compared to KO and catalytic inhibition ; CBP112 caused reduced expression at 2 . 4 % of genes , and only 0 . 2 % ( 25 transcripts ) were decreased more than 4 - fold , compared to > 3 % in KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 - treated cells ( Table S1 ) . These data show that catalytic inhibition has an impact on transcript levels that is similar to that of loss of the entire CBP / p300 protein in KO cells , indicating that CBP / p300 catalytic activity is the primary mechanism that drives CBP / p300 - dependent transcription . Although the scaffold func - tion of CBP / p300 is undoubtedly important , it does not appear sufﬁcient to regulate transcription independently of CBP / p300 catalytic activity , or it does so at a very small number of genes . In addition to its well - known function in transcriptional regula - tion , CBP / p300 can also regulate protein abundance post - tran - scriptionally , for example , by regulating acetylation - dependent Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 239 ( legend on next page ) 240 Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 protein stability ( Spange et al . , 2009 ) or by directly ubiquitylating proteins ( Shi et al . , 2009 ) . CBP / p300 KO , Cmpd - R , A - 485 , and CBP112 affected a subset of the proteome , mostly causing downregulation of proteins ( Figure 6D ; Table S1 ) . A larger num - ber of proteins were regulated in KO cells compared to Cmpd - R and A - 485 - treated cells , likely due to the different time - scale of these interventions . Notably , proteome changes were signiﬁ - cantly ( r = 0 . 75 ) correlated with transcriptome changes in KO cells ( Figure 6E ) , showing that most changes in protein abundance resulted from altered gene expression and that post - transcriptional mechanisms play a minor role in CBP / p300 - dependent proteome dynamics . In addition , of the 78 pro - teins that were more than 2 - fold downregulated in KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 , only 7 were not signiﬁcantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) reduced at the transcript level , and none of these proteins were acetylated by CBP / p300 . Thus , in our dataset , we found little evidence sup - porting a widespread role of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation in regulating protein stability . Rapid Acetylation Kinetics Regulate Transcription Aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) is a major integrator of diverse environmental signals such as chemical toxins , cancer cell metabolites , and bacterial pigments ( Murray et al . , 2014 ) . AHR - dependent transcriptional activation of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Cyp1a1 is required for detoxiﬁcation of aromatic hydrocarbons . Multiple KATs , including Ncoa1 , Ncoa3 , and CBP / p300 are implicated in AHR - induced Cyp1a1 transcription ( Fujii - Kuriyama and Mimura , 2005 ) ; however , the speciﬁc requirement of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation in AHR signaling is not known . We found that CBP / p300 affects AHR signaling at multiple levels ; AHR was downregulated at both the transcript and protein levels in KO , Cmpd - R , and A - 485 - treated cells , and CBP / p300 acetylated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator ( Arnt ) , which binds to AHR to promote AHR - depen - dent transcriptional activation ( Tables S2 and S5 ) . Most notably , Cmpd - R - treatment completely blocked Cyp1a1 gene induction in response to the AHR ligand 6 - formylindolo ( 3 , 2 - b ) carbazole ( FICZ ) in both MEF and Kasumi - 1 cells ( Figure 6F ) . In contrast , CBP112 partially reduced Cyp1a1 expression ( Figure 6F ) . These results show that CBP / p300 catalytic activity is indispensable for AHR - dependent Cyp1a1 transcription . To determine how quickly loss of CBP / p300 catalytic activity disrupted Cyp1a1 gene expression , we added Cmpd - R 1 hr after FICZ treatment . Cyp1a1 transcript abundance continued to in - crease for 3 hr after FICZ treatment in control cells , whereas addition of Cmpd - R 1 hr after FICZ treatment completely blocked further increases in transcript abundance , demon - strating acute disruption of Cyp1a1 transcription ( Figure 6G ) . These data show that CBP / p300 catalytic activity is required for Cyp1a1’s transcriptional maintenance , and that loss of this activity results in nearly immediate transcriptional arrest . Fast regulation of Cyp1a1 transcription suggests a causative role of acetylation in driving gene transcription , and strongly suggests that the subset of CBP / p300 - regulated sites that display rapid turnover is critical for regulating gene transcription . Database of the CBP / p300 Regulome Our work greatly expands the known repertoire of the endoge - nous CBP / p300 targets . To make this resource easily accessible to the community we generated a user - friendly web - based data - base ( http : / / p300db . choudharylab . org ) , which can be queried for a protein of interest to obtain information about CBP / p300 - regulated acetylation sites , as well as changes in the protein and transcript abundance . In addition to providing an overview of all identiﬁed sites and their positions in the queried protein , it includes information about site quantiﬁcation , site intensity , and peptide spectral counts ( Figure 7 ) , which are useful param - eters in prioritizing putative regulatory sites for functional inves - tigation . The database also provides a graphical overview of acetylation site regulation by different CBP / p300 perturbations used here , and allows visualization of acetylation dynamics at individual sites ( Figure 7 ) . The database shows interactions of the queried protein with other acetylated proteins in the dataset , and the interactive nature of the network allows further explora - tion of individual proteins in the network . Furthermore , the data - base can be batch - queried for proteins with speciﬁc functional domains , such as bromodomain , enabling a quick overview of CBP / p300 - dependent acetylation on a protein family . These , and additional features of the database offers a ‘‘one stop’’ solu - tion for convenient mining of all the datasets generated here . DISCUSSION Here , we present a high - conﬁdence map of the dynamic CBP / p300 acetylome and reveal the impact of CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation on transcript and protein regulation . Importantly , by combining chemical and genetic interventions , we were able to exclude the contribution of CBP / p300 - associated KATs that may be affected by loss of CBP / p300 protein . Our ultra - deep acetylome expands the repertoire of known CBP / p300 - regulated acetylation sites by more than 10 - fold ( Dancy and Cole , 2015 ) and our approach provides far greater stringency in attributing their regulation to CBP / p300 . It is possible that some of the identiﬁed acetylation sites are not directly acetylated by CBP / p300 and that their reduced abun - dance results from the altered activity of other KATs or KDACs . However , several lines of evidence suggest that most sites are direct targets of CBP / p300 : we did not observe altered acetyla - tion levels on canonical KATs and KDACs that would indicate that CBP / p300 targeted these enzymes or that their own auto - catalytic activity was reduced . Indeed , acetylation of previously identiﬁed histone substrates of other KATs ( i . e . , H3K23 for KAT6A / B ; H4K16 for KAT8 ; and H3K9 for KAT2A / KAT2B ) was Figure 7 .

Cell 174 , 231 – 244 , June 28 , 2018 241 not reduced in CBP / p300 KO or inhibitor - treated cells , indicating that the activity of these KATs for their canonical substrates was not altered . Furthermore , overexpression of p300 caused increased acetylation at 80 % of the sites that were downregu - lated in KO cells , suggesting that CBP / p300 directly targets these sites . Although we cannot fully rule out indirect effects on acetylation , our data strongly suggest that CBP / p300 directly targets a majority of the regulated sites identiﬁed in our experiments . CBP / p300 associates with several proteins that are reported to function as independent KATs , such as NCOA1 , NCOA3 , ATF2 , and CLOCK ( Drazic et al . , 2016 ) . We found no concrete evidence for a catalytic activity - independent role of CBP / p300 in promoting acetylation , for example , by recruitment of other KATs through its scaffolding function . Instead , the reduced acet - ylation observed in CBP / p300 KO appears to be entirely depen - dent on CBP / p300 catalytic activity . Our results indicate that proteins of the steroid receptor coactivator ( SRC ) , which in - cludes NCOA1 - 3 , are likely to be downstream targets of CBP / p300 . While we cannot exclude the possibility that CBP / p300 - associated KATs may target a limited set of sites that we did not quantify in our assays , their impact on the global CBP / p300 - acetylome appears negligible . Our analyses provide insights into the speciﬁcity of CBP / p300 as an acetyltransferase . We ﬁnd that CBP / p300 acetylates sub - strate proteins independently of linear amino acid motifs , and instead acetylates a majority of sites on targeted proteins . We further ﬁnd that CBP / p300 acetylates a multitude of transcrip - tional regulators and enhancer - associated proteins at closely spaced lysines ; consistent with CBP / p300’s previously reported tendency to acetylate lysine clusters ( Thompson et al . , 2001 ) . Based on these observations , we propose a model whereby CBP / p300 acts as an ‘‘acetyl - spray’’ at active enhancers , target - ing accessible regions on proximal proteins . We postulate that such high - density acetylation on proximal sites could create a dispersed interface for recruitment of bromodomain ( BRD ) proteins and may have functional consequences for activating transcription . Indeed , in addition to acetylated histones , BRD proteins can be recruited by acetylated non - histone proteins and for several BRDs , tandem acetylation cooperatively in - creases their binding afﬁnity to multiply acetylated ligands ( Mor - inie ` re et al . , 2009 ; Muller et al . , 2011 ) . Because locus - speciﬁc recruitment of BRDs , for example , through acetyl - mimetic synthetic transcription factors , is sufﬁcient to cause productive transcription at otherwise repressed loci ( Erwin et al . , 2017 ) , it is conceivable that widespread CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation at enhancers contributes to transcriptional activation by recruit - ing BRD proteins . Acetylation is widely linked to transcriptional regulation , and numerous individual and community - wide efforts , such as the ENCODE project ( https : / / www . encodeproject . org ) , have been undertaken to map the genomic distribution of histone acetyla - tion marks . However , the speciﬁcity of KATs , and the kinetics of histone acetylation , is poorly understood . This information is important for obtaining a functional understanding of acetylation marks , and to move from correlative patterns to establishing causal relationships . A survey of histone modiﬁcation - speciﬁc antibodies found that a considerable portion of the antibodies exhibit questionable speciﬁcity ( Egelhofer et al . , 2011 ) ; therefore , it is important to conﬁrm the regulation of these marks by anti - body - independent methods . Our MS - based quantitative map of histone acetylation deﬁnes sites that are exclusively acety - lated by CBP / p300 , which could help in more accurately deﬁning genomic regions that are occupied by catalytically active CBP / p300 . It is also notable that current epigenetic mapping of his - tone acetylation marks on chromatin is highly biased to H3 and H4 , particularly H3K27ac and H3K9ac . We ﬁnd that H2B is a ma - jor target of CBP / p300 , but much less is known about genomic distribution of H2B acetylation , indicating that its functional and diagnostic potential may be underappreciated . Our kinetic analyses provide a ﬁrst proteome - wide survey of site - speciﬁc acetylation dynamics and identify a subset of sites which displayed turnover rates that were up to an order of magni - tude faster than previously reported ‘‘very rapid’’ turnover of his - tone H3 / H4 acetylation sites ( Zheng et al . , 2013 ) . These results are reminiscent of the rapid dynamics of phosphorylation signaling , and show that acetylation signaling can occur with a similar degree of exquisite enzymatic regulation . The composite picture emerging from our quantitative ana - lyses of acetylation regulation , site - speciﬁc dynamics , and gene transcription , suggest that the subset of rapidly regulated CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation sites is a critical driver of gene transcription . This conclusion is supported by our observa - tion that inhibition of CBP / p300 activity results in an almost immediate arrest in AHR - induced gene transcription . Strikingly , CBP / p300 inhibition globally ablates acetylation at many sites , including a large number of sites on histones , yet it affects the transcription of only a subset of genes . This indicates that CBP / p300 - catalyzed acetylation is a unique signature that regu - lates the transcription of speciﬁc genes . Although a detailed understanding of how CBP / p300 regulates the transcription of speciﬁc genes will require further effort , our study provides a ﬁrst step toward gaining a systems - wide understanding of the com - plex relationship between KATs , acetylation , and gene transcription . In conclusion , our in - depth analyses reveal the rich intricacies of the CBP / p300 acetylome , and the resource dataset presented here provides a framework for decoding CBP / p300 functions in diverse biological processes and for understanding the impact of small - molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodo - main functions .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Immortalized Crebbp ﬂ / ﬂ ; Ep300 ﬂ / ﬂ mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) stably expressing Cre - ERT2 were kindly provided by the laboratory of Paul Brindle ( Kasper et al . , 2010 ) . The sex of these cells is not reported , and was not determined in our laboratory . Following transfection with Cre - ERT2 , cell clones derived from single colonies were recovered and tested for efﬁcient gene KO . Kasumi - 1 cells are derived from a human male with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) with an 8 ; 21 chromosome translocation . 293FT cells are a clonal isolate derived from human embryonal kidney cells transformed with the SV40 large T antigen . MEFs and Kasumi - 1 were cultured ( 37 (cid:4) C , 5 % CO2 ) in DMEM and RPMI1640 media ( Biowest ) , respectively . For SILAC labeling , the media was supplemented with regular arginine and lysine , or with heavy isotope - labeled arginine ( 13 C 6 , 15 N 4 - arginine , Sigma ) and lysine ( 13 C 6 , 15 N 2 - lysine , Cambridge Isotope Laboratories ) and dialyzed serum ( Sigma ) . All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma . METHOD DETAILS Cell culture and sample preparation The ﬂoxed Cbp and p300 alleles were deleted by treating cells with 2 m M 4 - hyroxy - tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT , Sigma ) , media was changed and fresh 4 - OHT added every 12 hr for a total of four treatments over 48 hr . Cells were cultured for an additional 24 - 36 hr to allow for complete depletion of CBP / p300 protein . For CBP / p300 acetyltransferase inhibitors ( 3 m M compound R ( Cmpd - R ) and A - 485 ) and bromodomain inhibitor ( 5 m M CBP112 ) cells were treated for 16 hr . Cells were harvested by washing 1x in PBS before on - plate lysis at 4 (cid:4) C using ice - cold lysis buffer ( 50mM HEPES , pH7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1x com - plete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ) . After cell lysis , 1 / 10 volume ice - cold 5M NaCl was added to the lysates to release chromatin - bound proteins , the lysate was sonicated to shear genomic DNA , and was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 8 , 000 x g for 15 min at 4 (cid:4) C . The supernatant was precipitated by addition of 4 volumes ( 80 % ﬁnal ) (cid:3) 20 (cid:4) C acetone . Acetone precipitated protein was dissolved in 8M guanidine hydrochloride ( GuHCl ) , 50mM HEPES , pH8 . 0 and protein content measured by BCA assay ( Pierce ) . Protein was reduced and alkylated by 5mM Tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine hydrochloride ( TCEP ) and 5mM chloroacetamide for 1 hr at room temperature . Before addition of proteases the protein was diluted to 2M GuHCl by addition of 50mM HEPES , pH8 . 0 . Lys - C was added ( 1 / 200 w : w ) and the protein digested for 2 - 4 hr at 37 (cid:4) C , the protein was further diluted to 1M GuHCl , before digesting with Continued REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Human Cyp1a1 Fwd 5 0 - ACCAGGACCCTGTCCAATCT - 3 0 Euroﬁns Genomics N / A Human Cyp1a1 Rev 5 0 - GAAGGCAGCCCTGTTTGTTC - 3 0 Euroﬁns Genomics N / A Recombinant DNA pCI - p300 Cole PA ; Thompson et al . , 2004 N / A Software and Algorithms MaxQuant ( developer version 1 . 5 . 5 . 4 ) Cox et al . , 2011 http : / / www . coxdocs . org / doku . php ? id = maxquant : start R version 3 . 4 . 3 The R Foundation https : / / www . r - project . org / AGOTOOL Scho¨lz et al . , 2015a https : / / agotool . sund . ku . dk / IceLogo stand - alone version 1 . 2 Colaert et al . , 2009 https : / / iomics . ugent . be / icelogoserver samr Tusher et al . , 2001 https : / / cran . r - project . org / web / packages / samr / samr . pdf MASS Venables and Ripley , 2002 https : / / cran . r - project . org / web / packages / MASS / MASS . pdf Mfuzz Kumar and Futschik , 2007 https : / / www . bioconductor . org / packages / devel / bioc / manuals / Mfuzz / man / Mfuzz . pdf CLAP Gnanavel et al . , 2014 http : / / nslab . mbu . iisc . ernet . in / clap / ITOL Letunic and Bork , 2016 https : / / itol . embl . de / D3 . js Bostock et al . , 2011 https : / / d3js . org / e2 Cell 174 , 231 – 244 . e1 – e6 , June 28 , 2018 trypsin protease ( 1 / 200 w : w ) overnight at 37 (cid:4) C . Peptides were puriﬁed using a Sep - pak C18 cartridge ( Waters ) and were eluted in 50 % acetonitrile . Acetylated peptide enrichment was performed using 10 - 20mg of puriﬁed peptides and high pH reversed - phase pre - fractionation , or by direct enrichment from unfractionated peptides followed by in - tip SCX fractionation or in - tip HpH fraction - ation ( for fractionation method references , and details for individual experiments , see Tables S2 and S3 ) . In all experiments acetylated peptides were enriched using the PTMscan acetyllysine antibody kit ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) . For proteome measurements the peptides were fractionated by high pH reversed - phase into 24 fractions or 8 - 10 fractions followed by in - tip SCX fractionation . Fractionation strategies are indicated in Table S2 . Approximately 1ug peptides were analyzed on the mass spectrometer for each proteome fraction . CBP / p300 inhibitor synthesis and CBP / p300 biochemical activity assay of inhibitors The synthesis of Compound - R ( Cmpd - R ) and A - 485 and inhibition of CBP and p300 acetyltransferase activity were assessed as described ( Lasko et al . , 2017 ) . Cmpd - R was identiﬁed based on its in vitro and cellular potency , and is related to compound 22 that we reported previously ( Michaelides et al . , 2017 ) . Acetyltransferase activity assays were performed using truncated p300 and CBP BHC domain proteins that contain the region from the bromodomain to the C / H3 domain . Assays were performed by detecting lysine acetylation of a biotinylated histone H4 ( 1 - 23 ) synthetic peptide ( SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRKVLRGG - K ( Biotin ) - NH2 ; ( Anas - pec , # AS - 65097 ) ) using a time - resolved ﬂuorescence energy transfer ( TR - FRET ) . Reactions were performed in a 10 m L volume using an assay buffer containing 100 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 80 m M EDTA , 40ug / mL BSA , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 . The CBP / p300 inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO and dispensed at 50 nL by a Labcyte Echo ( Labcyte , Sunnyvale , CA ) into white 384 well low - volume plates ( Perkin Elmer , # 6008289 ) in 3 - fold dilutions from 50 m M to 0 . 00075 m M . CBP or p300 - BHC protein at 0 . 6 nM was pre - incubated with Cmpd - R for 30 min . The reaction was initiated by adding 5 m L of a biotinylated synthetic histone - H4 peptide at 2 m M and acetyl coenzyme A ( Sigma - Aldrich , # A2056 ) at 0 . 5 m M for p300 or CBP - BHC . Following incubation for 1 hr at room temperature in a humidiﬁed chamber the reaction was terminated with 10 m L of 3 nM LANCE Ultra Europium - anti - acetyl - histone H4 lysine antibody ( Perkin Elmer , # TRF0412 - D ) , 900 nM LANCE Ultra ULight - Streptavidin ( Perkin Elmer , # TRF0102 - D ) in LANCE Detection Buffer ( PerkinElmer , # CR97 - 100 ) . TR - FRET measurements were obtained using a Perkin Elmer Envision with laser excitation at 335 nm and emission at 665 nm and 620 nm . Recombinant protein acetylation in vitro Full - length Codon - optimized His - p300 - Strep2 - Flag inserted into a pVL1393 baculovirus expression plasmid was expressed in Sf9 cells . Expressed p300 protein was puriﬁed from Sf9 cells over a HiTrap column and quantiﬁed / purity conﬁrmed by Coomassie stain - ing ( Zucconi et al . , 2016 ) . Six proteins that were identiﬁed as p300 substrates in our acetylome analyses were used for p300 acetyl - transferase assay . Five of these proteins were purchased from OriGene as recombinant puriﬁed proteins ( TTC33 ; TP302360 , FAM192A ; TP304378 , TRIM33 ; TP710251 , NPM1 ; TP303841 , JUNB ; TP303595 ) and PPM1G was puriﬁed from yeast cells , as follows . The Invitrogen ORF for full - length , GST - tagged PPM1G was transformed into yeast cells . After galactose induction , cells were lysed ; and PPM1G protein puriﬁed by GST - afﬁnity chromatography and glutathione elution . Protein concentration and purity were as - sessed by colloidal Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE . Acetylation reactions were performed using (cid:1) 1 . 5ug of protein substrate incu - bated with or without 40 nM p300 in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP , and 10 mM sodium butyrate . Reactions were initiated with 10 m M acetyl - CoA to a ﬁnal volume of 15 m l . After incubation at 30 (cid:4) C for 30 min , reactions were quenched with 1 % HCl aqueous solution . The entire experiment ( from in - vitro acetylation to mass spectrometry ) was performed in duplicate . Protein was re - suspended in 100ul 2 % sodium deoxycholate , 50mM HEPES pH8 . 0 , reduced with 1mM DTT at 37 (cid:4) C for 30min and subsequently alkylated by 5mM chloroacetamide for 1 hr at room temperature , prior to digestion with (cid:1) 1 / 100 trypsin protease at 37 (cid:4) C for 16 hr . Approximately 200fmol protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry in technical triplicate measurements . Cell lysate protein acetylation SILAC labeled Crebbp ﬂ / ﬂ ; Ep300 ﬂ / ﬂ MEF cells ( described above ) were harvested by typsin , washed twice in PBS , and ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen . Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic cell lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM sodium butyrate ) and ﬂash frozen . Pellets were thawed , and lysed by passage through a QiaShredder column ( QIAGEN ) . The cell lysate was concentrated with an Amicon 3K MWCO column to (cid:1) 10mg / ml ( BCA assay ) . The lysates were then preincubated in reaction buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM TCEP ) with 40 nM p300 ± 20 m M A - 485 for 15 min at 4 (cid:4) C . The reaction was initiated with the addition of 20 m M acetyl - CoA and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 (cid:4) C . Reactions were quenched with 1 % aqueous HCl and ﬂash frozen for mass spectrometry . Digestion to peptides , enrichment of acetylated peptides , and SILAC - based quantiﬁcation , was performed as described below . Overexpression of p300 in 293FT cells 293FT cells were cultured in SILAC DMEM media as described above for MEF cells . A single 15cm plate at (cid:1) 80 % conﬂuency was transfected with pCI - p300 vector expressing full - length wild - type p300 ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) using Turbofect transfection reagent ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , # R0531 ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were harvested after 72hrs . Cell lysis , protein lysate preparation , digestion to peptides , enrichment of acetylated peptides , and SILAC - based quantiﬁcation , was performed as described below . Cell 174 , 231 – 244 . e1 – e6 , June 28 , 2018 e3 High - content microscopy PC - 3 cells were plated in Collagen I coated 96 - well view plates ( Perkin Elmer , # 6005810 ) overnight . Cells were then treated with an 8 - point dose half - log dose response Compound - R starting at 10 m M for the indicated times . Cells were ﬁxed in 10 % formaldehyde ( Polysciences , Inc . , # 04018 ) at room temperature for 10 min , washed in PBS , and then permeablized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min . Cells were then blocked in 1 % BSA for 1 h and incubated with the incubated with H3K27Ac and H3K9Ac antibodies ( Cell Signaling Technology ; H3K9ac # 9649 , H2K27ac # 8173 ) in antibody dilution buffer ( 0 . 3 % BSA in PBS ) overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . Cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG antibodies ( Life Technolo - gies , # A - 11029 ) , Alexa Fluor555 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Life Technologies , # A - 21424 ) antibodies , and Hoechst 33342 ( Life Technologies , # H3570 ) for 1 h at room temperature . After washing four times in PBS , plates were scanned within 24 h of processing on a ThermoFisher CellInsight using the target activation algorithm acquiring 15 ﬁelds per well . Fluorescence intensities were quan - tiﬁed using the average mean intensity function . IC 50 values for H3K27Ac and H3K9Ac inhibition were calculated using a sigmoidal ﬁt of the concentration / inhibition response curves . Mass spectrometry Peptide fractions were analyzed by online nanoﬂow liquid chromatography - coupled tandem mass spectrometry ( nLC - MS / MS ) using a Proxeon easy nLC system connected to a Q - Exactive HF mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Analysis of transcript abundance Global transcript abundance was analyzed using biological triplicate measurements . RNA was puriﬁed using the RNeasy Mini Kit from QIAGEN and RNA integrity was determined using the 2100 Bioanalyzer system ( Agilent Technologies ) . Transcript abundance was measured using one - color 8 3 60K Mouse Gene Expression Microarrays ( Agilent Technologies , G4852B ) as per the manufac - turer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , 100 ng of total RNA was labeled using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit ( Agilent Technologies , 5190 - 2305 ) . Labeled samples were hybridized overnight and then washed and scanned using the high - sensitivity protocol ( AgilentG3 _ HiSen _ GX _ 1color ) on a SureScan microarray scanner ( Agilent Technologies ) , and probe intensities were obtained by taking the gProcessedSignal from the output of Agilent feature extraction software using default settings . Quantitative PCR analysis of Cyp1a1 gene expression All experiments were performed using the MEF and Kasumi - 1 cells and culture conditions described above . To induce Cyp1a1 gene expression , cells were treated with 10 m M 6 - Formylindolo ( 3 , 2 - b ) carbazole ( FICZ , Sigma ) prepared in DMSO . RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Total RNA was quantiﬁed using a nano - drop spectrom - eter ( Thermo ) and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) was synthesized using the QuantiTect Rev . Transcription kit ( QIAGEN ) . Reverse tran - scription reactions were diluted with H 2 O and stored at (cid:3) 20 (cid:4) C . Quantitative PCR was performed using Brilliant II SYBR (cid:2) Green QPCR Master Mix ( Agilent ) and a Stratagene Mx3005P instrument . The expression levels of TATA - box binding protein ( TBP ) and Cyp1a1 were determined using standard curve generated from the sample expressing the highest levels of Cyp1a1 . TBP expression varied by less than 2 - fold between individual samples and was used to correct Cyp1a1 expression for differences in cDNA content . The following primers were used for QPCR : mouse TBP , 5 0 - GTGCCAGATACATTCCGCCT - 3 0 and 5 0 - AGCTGCGTTTT TGTGCAGAG - 3 0 ; Cyp1a1 , 5 0 - GAGGCTAAACAGCCTTCCCA - 3 0 and 5 0 - ACAGGAGCACCCTGTTTGTT - 3 0 , and human TBP , 5 0 - TGG CACCAGGTGATGCCCTT - 3 0 and 5 0 - TGCCCAGATAGCAGCACGGT - 3 0 ; Cyp1a1 , 5 0 - ACCAGGACCCTGTCCAATCT - 3 0 and 5 0 - GAA GGCAGCCCTGTTTGTTC - 3 0 . H3K56ac stoichiometry measurement Site - speciﬁcally acetylated ( at H3K56 ) histone H3 was produced in E . coli using the orthogonal N ( epsilon ) - acetyllysyl - tRNA synthe - tase / tRNA ( CUA ) technology ( Neumann et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) . To determine H3K56ac stoichiometry we ﬁrst isolated histones from SILAC heavy - labeled control and Cmpd - R - treated MEFs ( 16h , 3 m M Cmpd - R ) using a standard acid extraction protocol . Brieﬂy , cells were lysed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 1x complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Lysate was centrifuged at 1 , 000 x g , the supernatant discarded , and the pellet extracted with 0 . 2Mhydrochloric acid overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . Extracted histones were recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation at 1 , 000 x g . Recombinant H3K56ac was mixed with histone preparations from SILAC heavy - labeled control and CmpR - treated cells in a 10 - fold serial dilution to determine the ratio of recombinant to native H3 . Recombinant H3K56ac was then mixed with histone preparations to a ﬁnal stoichiometry of 0 . 1 % , 0 . 01 % , and 0 . 001 % before trypsin digestion of histones to peptides , and acetylated peptide enrichment with anti - acetyllysine anti - body . Acetylated peptides were analyzed by MS and the relative intensities of the light SILAC - labeled recombinant H3K56ac and heavy SILAC - labeled native H3K56ac peptides were compared . Stoichiometry was calculated based on these comparisons at all three dilutions ( 0 . 1 % , 0 . 01 % , and 0 . 001 % ) . The experiment was performed in two independent biological replicates . e4 Cell 174 , 231 – 244 . e1 – e6 , June 28 , 2018 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Peptide and protein identiﬁcation The raw MS data was computationally processed using MaxQuant ( developer version 1 . 5 . 5 . 4 ) and searched against the UniProt database ( downloaded July 6 , 2015 ) using the integrated Andromeda search engine ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) . The acetyl ( K ) sites table was ﬁltered to remove reverse decoy database entries , contaminant entries , and entries with localization probability less than 90 % ( 0 . 9 ) . Identiﬁed sites required a minimum Andromeda search score of 40 . Protein quantiﬁcation required a minimum of 2 pep - tides , 1 unique peptide , and 2 SILAC ratio counts ; common contaminants , proteins only identiﬁed by a modiﬁcation site , and false hits identiﬁed from the reversed database were removed . Relative acetylation stoichiometry was estimated using acetylation site inten - sity corrected for differences in protein abundance , otherwise referred to as abundance - corrected intensity ( ACI ) . ACI was calculated by dividing acetylation site intensity by iBAQ protein abundance . Calculation of deacetylation half - life The deacetylation rate after A - 485 - treatment was analyzed using the sites that were quantiﬁed at all seven time points . We applied fuzzy c - means method using Mfuzz to classify the quantiﬁed sites as ‘‘fast , ’’ ‘‘slow’’ and ‘‘unregulated’’ ( Futschik and Carlisle , 2005 ) . Half - lives were only calculated for regulated ( ‘‘fast’’ or ‘‘slow’’ ) sites . We assumed that deacetylation kinetics at early time points follow an exponential decay , formulated as ( dN / dt = (cid:3) l N ) , where N is the concentration of each acetyl site and l is the exponential decay constant . This is transformed as ( log2 ( N / N 0 ) ) = (cid:3) ( t / t 1 / 2 ) , where N 0 is the concentration at time 0 , t 1 / 2 is the half - life and t is the time after A - 485 treatment . We determined the ranges between Q1 – 3 . 0 * IQR and Q3 + 3 . 0 * IQR as an ‘acceptable variability range’ and used this as a threshold to exclude the outliers . To estimate the half - life , we used a multi - step model . First , we constructed a model using only sites with replicate data from early time points and estimated the parameter l from the replicate data . To limit these analyses to high - conﬁdence data , the data were selected based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) To ensure accurate quantiﬁcation , we only used log2 ratio values that were between 0 and (cid:3) 3 . 32 ( not more than 10 - fold reduced ) , and also within the acceptable variable range from the mean of replicates , ( 2 ) Only the data from early time points ( for ‘‘slow’’ within 4 hr , and for ‘‘fast’’ within 1 hr ) were used , and ( 3 ) If no data remained , the data within 1 hr were used . Then , the parameter was estimated by the robust linear regression model using the R package MASS ( Venables and Ripley , 2002 ) . In the second step , the model was reﬁned using all the data within the acceptable variability ranges . The parameter was updated by using all the data that passed the following criteria : ( 1 ) The log2 ratio values should be within the acceptable variable range from the estimated value of the model , ( 2 ) If no data had the log2 ratio value of less than (cid:3) 1 , the data with the closest value of (cid:3) 1 were included , and ( 3 ) the step 2 was repeated until the parameters converged . We excluded data with more than 8 hr half - life because in our experimental setting and analysis method , it was difﬁcult to correctly es - timate half - life longer than 8 hr . Statistical analysis of microarray data The resultant microarray data was processed as follows ; the intensity values were log2 transformed , for duplicated probes the mean was calculated , quantile normalization was used to correct for inter - array variability , for genes with multiple probes the median intensity values were used . The Statistical Analysis of Microarray ( SAM ) method was used to calculate signiﬁcant ( p value ) differ - ences , adjusted p values were calculated using the Benjamini - Hochberg method . Signiﬁcantly regulated genes were classiﬁed based on an adjusted p value < 0 . 05 and a magnitude fold change > 2 . Low abundant , non - expressed transcripts were ﬁltered from the data based on a probe intensity cutoff of Log2 < 4 in all samples . Statistical analyses Acetylome measurements of CBP / p300 KO , Cmpd - R , A - 485 , and CBP112 ( Figure 1 ) were performed in biological triplicates . Acetylome measurements of in vitro acetylation with recombinant p300 ( Figure 2H ) , and in - vivo p300 overexpression in 293FT cells ( Figure 2I ) were performed in duplicate . Acetylome time course analysis after A - 485 - treatment ( Figure 4 ) was performed in at least biological duplicate measurements for each time point , exact details are provided in Table S3 . Microarray analysis of transcript abundance ( Figure 6 ) was performed in a minimum of three biological replicates . Statistical tests , such as Pearson’s correlation ( r ) , Fisher test , and Wilcoxon test were performed in R . Boxplots were generated using R , the lower and the upper hinges of the boxes correspond to the 25 % and the 75 % percentile , the bar in the box shows the median . The upper whisker extends to the largest value but maximal 1 . 5 times the IQR from the upper hinge . Similarly , the lower whisker extends from the lower hinge at most 1 . 5 IQR . Outlier data points ( outside the hinges ) were not drawn . Gene Ontology analysis was performed using UniProt keywords and AGOTOOL ( Scho¨lz et al . , 2015a ) . UniProt keywords were mapped to acetylation site - level data and the signiﬁcance of enrichment was calculated by Fisher test . Acetylation site sequence logos were generated us - ing the IceLogo ( Colaert et al . , 2009 ) stand - alone application version 1 . 2 ; comparing sequence windows of regulated ( > 2 - fold decreased acetylation ) to unregulated sites . Subcellular compartment analysis was performed by mapping proteins with the regu - lated sites to UniProt keywords , only the sites associated with proteins annotated to a single subcellular compartment were used in the analysis .
