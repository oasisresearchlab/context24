A broad ies that share our environment . In this work , we test the understanding of embodiment is necessary to provide a solid hypothesis that physical embodiment has a measurable effect on footing for HRI and to contextualize its relationship with performance and perception of social interactions . Support of other human - factors issues . this hypothesis would suggest fundamental differences between seekr ctrueca virtual agents and robots from a social standpoint and have sig - HRI seeks constructive constraints that can serve as nificant implications for human - robot interaction . We measure guidelines to assist in making design decisions . A roboticist task performance and perception of a robot ' s social abilities in constructing a system for use around humans currently has a structured but open - ended task based on the Towers of Hanoi few established design principles . Yet , such principles are puzzle . Our experiment compares aspects of embodiment by . . . evaluating : ( 1 ) the difference between a physical robot and paticar itica au of to the number of factors a simulated one ; ( 2 ) the effect of physical presence through that can influence an HRI system . Insight into the nature a co - located robot versus a remote tele - present robot . We of human social interaction , particularly evidence showing present data from a pilot study with 12 subjects showing fundamental differences between embodied and disembodied interesting differences in perception of remote physical robot ' s communication , would be valuable . and simulated agent ' s attention to the task , and task enjoyment . This paper presents pilot data from an empirical study Index Terms - Human - robot interaction , embodiment of the role of physical embodiment in a task involving a social robot . In particular , we attempt to distinguish between I . INTRODUCTION the effect of physical presence and virtual versus material A growing human - robot interaction ( HRI ) community is embodiment . Trials with human participants permit com - focusing on the social aspects of autonomous robots . This parison of task performance and perceived social awareness research is critical if robots are to become part of people ' s ( by the robot ) in three conditions : ( 1 ) a co - located physical everyday lives . Research in HRI is challenging because , in robot , ( 2 ) a remotely located ( tele - present ) robot , and ( 3 ) addition to engineering and technological hurdles , the many a simulated robot . In each case , the robot engages the factors that interact to form a rich social experience must participants through a simple Towers of Hanoi puzzle . The be teased apart for proper study . One factor with possible robot supervises the task , including explaining the puzzle , implications for social interaction is that a robot has a setting intermediate goals , directing the person ' s behavior , physical body . A robot ' s experience of the physical world and enforcing the rules of the game . and social situation , its perception , computing , and actions Our results support the belief that physical embodiment is are thus all attributable to a tangible artifact . Moreover , an important factor in social tasks and that it has an effect such attribution ( be it implicit , explicit or both ) may have on the perception of robot ' s social situatedness . In particular , an important role in natural social interaction . This paper presence of a physical robot is most enjoyable and believed addresses the question : " yes a robot ' s physical embodiment to be more watchful than either a virtual agent , or even a have a measurable affect on its social interactions ? " physical one separated via a video conferencing setup . A greater understanding of the social implications of embodiment will inform design of social robots . In robot II . RELATED WORK systems designed with social interaction as their primary The role of embodiment within social robot interactions goal ( e . g . , entertainment robots [ 1 ] and socially assistive has notyet been the subject of directinvestigation . Anumber robots [ 4 ] ) this study addresses the question of how robots of reasons exist for this , but perhaps most significant is that differ , and could complement , alternative technologies like the relationship between embodiment and situatedness has 1 - 4244 - 0565 - 3 / 06 / $ 20 . OO Â©r2006 IEEE . 117 not been explicitly articulated within a social context . For example , Fong et al . [ 5 ] define social situatedness for robots in a manner that could apply to virtual agents . Situatedness ( social or otherwise ) has been thought of as applicable to virtual agents within a broader Al view [ 11 ] . On the other - hand , Pfeifer and Scheier [ 13 ] argued that : " Intelligence cannot merely exist in the form of an abstract algorithm but requires a physical instantiation , a body . " Several authors Fig . 1 . The classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle with three rings ( slightly view the a virtual avatar as adequate embodiment , while exploded for clarity ) and three pegs as used in the experiments . In our set - others have asserted that a robot may not be adequately up each of the three rings has a different color and mass . Three weight sensors under each peg and a single camera allow the robot to estimate the embodied ; see Ziemke [ 17 ] for this debate . We use the state of the puzzle . term physically embodied to refer exclusively to a robot ' s body , and this study seeks to understand the key impact such embodiment and physical presence have on social bodies and that rendering a graphical body for a virtual interactions . agent is not equivalent . Our view is teleological : if physical Frequently , an HRI component is added to an existing embodiment has unique properties , e . g . , producing patient system . Furthermore , novelty alone is usually sufficient to compliance through mutual empathy , then those aspects justify robots for entertainment purposes , at least initially . should be exploited . More serious and sustained needs ( e . g . , rehabilitation , elder care . nursing , educating ) require a better understanding of III . FORMAL HYPOTHESES the factors involved . Kiesler and Goetz [ 9 ] examined the Robots offer uniquely controllable experimental condi - nature of robot personality ( terse versus jovial ) as one such tions which allow social characteristics that have , until now , factor . They evaluated aspects of robot form , like height not been accessible for controlled study . Social robots also comparable to a person versus a pet , and discussed human raise new questions . We believe this to be the case in mental models of the robot . Their findings were that , while dealing with embodiment . To tease apart the difference the appearances were different , the dialog directed toward between realism and physical situatedness , we formulated the robot was the same in each case . the following hypotheses : The closest existing work to the present study was carried Hi .

We thus used a task that , while simple , provides a shared context for the B . Experimental Design robot and human participant . The task is also relevant to our broader assistive robotics agenda since the physical effort The pegs , rings , and robot ( when appllcable ) are placed on tables with hei ht of approximately 1 . 2m .

Each participant performs the three conditions in a ran - domly assigned order . A questionnaire is filled out after each condition and the questions are presented before running the condition . Questions asked after each condition are identical and are given in the Appendix . After completion of all three conditions , the participants answer a final questionnaire with Fig . 3 .

In conditions ( b ) _ and ( C ) , the audio is played through speakers beside the Before each condition , the subject is instructed to follow the robot ' s instructions for the Tower of Hanoi task , and to press a button when desiring to stop .
